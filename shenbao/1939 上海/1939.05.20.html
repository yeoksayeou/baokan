<h3>美在遠東採取堅強態度　各方面一臻予以好評　美駐軍接有命令必要時武力保僑　克萊琪訪日外次表示與美同見角　日發言人猶稱其已定政策策不變更</h3>
<p>（紐約）　英法美三國以强硬手段處理鼓浪嶼案一事、此間各農報咸表示滿意、僉謂此種舉動、乃爲遏止日本企圖之創舉、蓋日本蓄意將西方各國接諸中國境外也、民主黨紐的泰晤士報載稱、「日本勢力所及之處、外國利益備受侵蝕、所得繼續保持者、僅剩適應於日本計劃之一部分而已、此層雖經該國一再吾認、但衡諸事實、無可諱飾、惟是、日本貨物輸往英法美三國數額、佔共出口總額四分之一乃至三分之一、然則日本對於各該國之利益又安可輕蔑乎、」共和黨紐的民聲講壇報載稱、「西方各國在鼓浪嶼所作舉動、曁美國國務院關於上海公共租界問題之照會、均可視爲滿意、日本悍然要求控制各該處公共租界、宜其招致强烈的憤懣」云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　鼓浪嶼事件頃由泰晤士報加以評論云、「此類事件、似可謂爲笨拙、且非第二次發生、亦非以此爲最後一次、溯自中日交戰以來、日本軍人與中國境內各外國租界之關係、宛如小犬與刺蝟、小犬狺狺之不已、刺蝟乃似有所戒懼而抑制共活動、而小犬復不時活躍、作試騐性的襲擊、天津上海兩處租界、先遭侵蝕、迄至上星期間、又有事於鼓浪嶼、此共意念、昭然若揭、但亦迄今未能如願以償、祇以本性使然、亦不必期以遽爾中止活動」云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　遠東現又示吾人以對待獨裁者共道在予以堅强對待之實例、鼓浪嶼地位與上海公共租界適同、如民治國在鼓浪嶼退讓、則欲將來立足於上海也難矣、日本陸戰隊之在鼓浪嶼登陸、乃一種試騐行爲、但英美法當局旣表示可欽佩之堅强態度、日本卽開始撤兵云、伯明罕郵報稱、自中日戰爭開始以來、民治國在遠東爲自謀者、共最佳之舉動、無過於厦門事件之應付云、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（香港）　日政府五月三日照會英美兩政府、闡明日政府對於維持上海公共租界之見解、美政府巳於十七日同日方表示其礙難允諾之意、茲英政府亦與美政府採取同一步驟、十九日上午十一時、駐日大使克萊琪訪問澤田次官、諮明共與美政府主旨相同之見解、然日政府認爲公共租界機構之改革、係建設「東亞新秩序」之必要條件、故今後仍將照旣定方針邁進也、（十九日電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　今日據國務部洩露、美國在遠東之軍隊曾接得命令、於必要時可用武力、以保衛僑居鼓浪嶼公共租界之美人、目下美輕巡洋艦「大理石」號、驅逐艦『勒爾莫』號、俱停泊於厦門、同時美兵四十二人在軍官指揮之下、已於咋日在鼓浪嶼登陸、英法二國亦以同樣之軍力在該處登陸、現登陸外國軍隊之實力、與尚未撤退仍駐於鼓浪嶼之日軍之數目相等云、（十八日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日外務省發言人今日宣稱、在鼓浪嶼登陸之日本陸戰隊、並未擾及該處公共租界中之任何外僑、外報所載之消息、殊非事實、該發言入對於英美法三國在鼓浪嶼集中軍艦及派水兵登陸之聯合行動表示扼腕、蓋以英美法此舉之理由、係因日本登陸部隊曾搜查外僑、實則日方並未搜查外僑、更未擾及任何外籍居民也、該發言人又稱、去年日本陸戰隊曾在鼓浪嶼巡邏歷兩月之久、各國對之、並未提出任何交涉或抗議、而外國軍艦亦未派水兵登陸云、該發人續稱、鼓浪嶼登陸日兵之全部撤退、將全視未來局勢之發展而定、不能因任何國家之抗議而撤退、日方登陸之部隊、現已减至最少限度、大部份已因局勢之緩和而撤退矣、該發言人末稱、此次撤退完全出於自動、並鄭重申言日陸戰隊之登陸完全係一種緊急方法、以便保護日僑之生命財產、與華南艦隊司令之安全、蓋其到達鼓浪嶼之時、適爲厦門商會會長洪立勳（譯音）被刺之日也云、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日外務省發言人今日表示其意見、以爲任何國家不能改變日本對於在華公共居留地及外國租界問題之已定政策、惟日政府對有關係之外國、仍繼續維持友好談判、以謀此問題之解決、該發言人答復關於美政府拒絕日本要求在上海公共租界工部局擴大權力事之問話謂、日政府並未請求各國答覆其對於上海公共租界政策之備忘錄、又謂上海日當局現正與工部局進行改組工部局及維持公共租界和平與秩序之談判云、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）　今日中國官員竭力贊成美·英·法·對日軍佔領鼓浪嶼所採取之態度、稱之爲保護第三國在華利益與彼等在公共租界之權利之「決定要素、」共財政界鉅子告美聯社稱、武力爲唯一應付辦法、第三國家之此種行動、卽表示彼等已不能容忍日本之侵佔公共租界、此舉無疑已使上海與天津租界不致發生與此相同之事件云、（十九日美聯社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>反英運動的分析</h3>
<p>日本自開戰以來，對於遠柬利益關係最大的英國，常常進行其二重性的外交，忽而利誘，忽而威脅，有時雙管齊下，波譎雲幻，極變化的能事，好像這裏面包孕着無數的矛盾。然而我們與其說這是矛盾，母髯說是日方一把劍的兩刃；動態雖正反不同，作用却並無二致。利誘的目的，無非耍使英國入甕而放棄遠東的權益，威脅的目的，又無非要使英國解甲而放棄遠東的權益。英國能放棄遠東的權益，其他美法各國也可以如法泡製，於是去年十二月二十二日近衛的主張可以實現，日本排斥歐美，獨覇東亞的目的也可以達到了。這可以說是日方更重要的用意。</p>
<p>利誘的最近表現，在日本不參加三角軍事同盟的一點上，好像已到了秋波傳送的微妙境界。至於威脅，事例太多了；寇爾大使一到重慶，重慶就發生大轟炸，一到成都，成都又有空襲的警報，累得大使露立終宵，感冒了風寒；淪陷區域內的　反英運動，日益增甚：最近更變本加厲，蔓延到上海，例如虹口狄思威路，前日下午有若干不滿學齡的小兄散發所謂反英傳單。這種一正一反同時趨於高潮的現象，無非表示日方的對英企圖，已到了滬諺所說「猴急」的程度。</p>
<p>日本為什麼要這樣「猴急」？從主觀的需要上說，日本自從開戰以來，就自知很少把握，因此一面企圖減少各國對華的援助，削弱華方的抗戰能力；一面又進行其鞏固佔領區內勢力的工作，排斥第三者在華的權益，以遂其獨占的野心。在這樣二重企圖之下，日本認為最重要的對象，應該是和遠東利益關係最深的英國；因此他的外交工作，也一向集中在對英上面。如果英國吞餌上鈎，向他表示屈服，這固然是日方所馨香禱祝的事；吾則退一步打算，倘使英國因為不勝絮聒之煩，竟出來斡旋和平，逼迫着中國接受城下之盟，在日方也未始不是一件額外的收穫。日方這把如意算盤，固然由來已久，不自最近為始；但最近他的企圖却更顯得迫切。原來日方的在華軍事，目前已一步步陷入於不利的地位，非惟「板垣停戰綫」所計劃着的進攻西北西南的企圖毫無把握。就是已佔領的點綫各地，也在華軍小試鋒刃的四月出擊裏，暴露着動搖的模樣。因此日軍在焦躁煩悶的情緒之下，便不得不加緊找尋出路，於是想利用英國的企圖，也就更見其急迫了。</p>
<p>再從客觀的形勢上說：世界反侵略集團的組織，最近已有成功的可能；這個組織即使不包括遠東在內，但歐洲方面如果能夠暫保小康，各國將移其目光注視遠東，這也是事理所必然。日本方面對這一層當然心存戒懼，因此希望在反侵略集團組織還沒有完成以前，赶快攫奪各國在華的權益。英國是在華權益關係最大的一國，同時英國在世界、反侵略集團組織中，又居於領導者的地位，所以在所謂「挽弓當挽强，擒賊先擒王」的觀念之下，日本又急切耍排斥英國了。</p>
<p>總之，本對英國，又懼怕，又憤恨，一向如此，現在更如此；日本希望英國怕他的絮聒，進他圈套，一向有這樣的打算，現在却又打算得更迫切。然而，日本的這種企圖有什麼效果呢？事實上日本一步步加緊的逼迫英國，英國却就一步步加緊的援助中國；日本一步步威脅英國在華的權益，英國却一步步改用强固的方法保護其權益；日本一步步企圖分化遠東關係各國，英國却又一步步聯合各國，採取一致的行動。從各方面看來，英國非但始終沒有鑽進日本的圈套，而且在最近的鼓浪嶼事件上，更充分表示了維護權益的決心。這樣，日本果然得到了什麼？他得到的是對他預期相反的結果，即英國的强硬，各國和英國態度的一致。事實上這是帮助了中國，而不是帮助了日本。日方的一切企圖顯然已歸失敗，他一向利用的擒縱手段，到底竟一無施展的餘地。</p>
<p>從今以後，日本在中國境內策動着的偽反英運動，大概還不會戢止，但是它的貴質必然地要從擒縱的手段轉變為洩憤的舉動；然而這種江河日下的辦法，結果也祗有自陷於更焦躁煩悶的境地裏，對於事實那有絲毫補益！</p>
<h3>美國態度堅決英報表示興奮</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　孟却斯德指導報今日社論謂、日本着眼於上海更重要局勢、故有意造成厦門鼓浪嶼公共租界之事件、以試騐西方列强之反響、鼓浪嶼事件中最使人興奮之點、為美政府之態度、美政府首先提出抗議、首先派共總司令前往鼓浪嶼、並首先派陸戰隊在該島登陸、美國自始至終表示其與英國之種種準備、絕未有逃避其應負義務之意、此種態度應使畏首畏尾之英政府有所激發、蓋英政府雖在歐洲試行綏靖政策失收之後、猶主張在遠東採行綏靖政策也、此種政策之唯一結果、厥為鼓勵日本境內及日軍在華佔據區域內之劇烈的反英運動而已、日本之有此學動、無疑的根據於就敵方陣綫最弱點加以攻擊之理論也、美國旣凖備合作、以保障吾人在鼓浪嶼之共同利益矣、由此推之、美國當亦願於必要時在上海或遠東他處作同樣行動、吾人言念及此、為之一慰、而許多人所抱英蘇盟的或將在日本政策上發生不利影響之惶慮、亦當可冰釋矣、（十九日路透社電）　美致日照會全文見第六版</p>
<h3>三國向日建議同時撤退武力</h3>
<p>（香港）　今日據日本權威方而所洩露之消息、美英法三國在鼓浪嶼之海軍當局、昨日連合向日本海軍司令建議、公共租界內之所有武裝兵士、均於同時連合撤退、日方對此項建議之答復之內容、現猶未發表、此間海軍當局信、此項報吿相當準確、因各方對撤退鼓浪嶼所有武裝兵士一事、曾討論擬召集一會議之計劃也、（十九日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英政府昨日通知日本、略謂英國在鼓浪嶼登陸之海軍陸戰隊人數、此後將與日方在該處之陸戰隊、為相等數目之减少、據政府方面消息、目前英國海軍在鼓浪嶼登陸者確為四十二人、與日軍在該島之數完全相等、（十九日美聯社電）</p>
<h3>澤田與英大使商談鼓嶼事件</h3>
<p>（東京）　日本外務决官澤田、昨日接見英國大使克萊琪、商討鼓浪嶼事件、同時官方宣稱、關於日海軍在鼓浪嶼登陸、英國於五月十六日所提之抗議、日本已經提出答覆、其中申明日海軍登陸之原因有三，　逮捕恐怖份子之緊急措施、　防止同樣事件之重演、　保護現在鼓浪嶼訪問之日本華南海軍總司令、同時保瞪一俟鼓浪嶼緊張弛緩、日本海軍卽將逐漸撤退云、（十九日海通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日本外相有田、昨日於美國駐日大使格魯起程返國之前、接見格氏、吿以關於美國拒絕日本對上海公共租界工部局提議一事、將使美日間在華問題不能有所廓淸、有田繼稱、渠相信若美國放棄國際會議之意見、與日本進行直接談判、則美日間若干問題、均可獲得解決、但必須以美國承認日本在遠柬一般的立塲為條件耳、有田更稱、日本「改組遠東」之計劃並不妨碍美國在華利益之發展、同時日本在中國以外之遠束、發展其利益、亦不致與美國衝突云、（十九日海通社電）</p>
<h3>三大民主國家合保遠東利益</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　英法美三國海軍陸戰隊同時在中國鼓浪嶼登陸之後、此間政府接近人士頃加以評論云、三大民治國保有聯帶關係、茲已決定合力保衛其在遠東所保有之利益徒然在外交上抗議之事、可謂已成過去、德義兩國現正壓迫日本、加入軍事同盟條的、該國若受德義兩國之慫恿、而推行反法反英政策、則英法美三國卽當會同採取防禦措置、予以對付、英國新近在紐西蘭首府威林頓城召集大平洋會議、討論大平洋印度洋各屬地保護問題、其所商定之防禦計劃、主張由英法兩國合作、互相保衛所有各屬地、英國政府已將會議結果、通吿法國、卽美國亦已在實際上加入此種防禦組織云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　鼓浪嶼事件與上海公共租界問題、頃由各報加以評論、均謂西方各國所取態度、至可滿意、右派小日報載稱、「英法美三國在遠東方面、茲已同時有所努力、不復作何片面之退讓、美國政府且不顧孤立主義派之反對、積極在中國保衛其利益、此鼓浪嶼事件所以具有特殊意義也」云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日報猶欲鼓吹取斷然的步驟</h3>

<p>（重慶）　鄂北戰事詳情、中國軍事當局、不願表示、惟聞諸可恃方面、華軍在一種佈置週密與實施敏捷之反攻中、已獲有重要勝利、不過戰事現猶在進行中、故此勝利之全部意義、將於日後見之、路透社從可恃方面探悉、日軍在本月初、倐作包抄行動、冀以兩翼包圍隨縣一帶之華軍、其時唐河華軍之主力部隊、乃立卽分兩路撤退、一北趨南陽、一西往襄陽、迨日軍在唐河取得聯絡後、湯恩伯所指揮之軍團、遂突出反攻、而前自唐河撤退之華軍、亦同時開回、加入反攻、共勢甚猛、日軍遠道竄入、旣感疲勞、且與共主力部隊隔斷、乃不得不向棗陽退却、估計此役、日軍死者逾萬、華軍乘勝追擊、經過大洪山脚、沿途佈滿日兵屍體、據中國軍事當局言、日方前侈談在鄂北包圍華軍二十師之衆、但現忽寂然無言、此卽為華軍勝利之證（十九日路透社電）</p>

<h3>美致日照會全文</h3>
<p>美政府為日本要求修改上海公共租界地皮章稈事致日政府之覆文、曾由美聯社電傳其耍略、巳誌咋報、其全文昨日由駐滬美總領事署宣布、特途譯如次、</p>
<p>為五月三日日本外務决官以關於修正上海公共租界地皮章程問題、及關於變動與改善公共租界行政機構問題之備忘錄、送達駐東京美國大使事、查備忘錄涉及上海公共租界現所實行之地皮章程發生效力之日期、及聲明現有之行政機構有許多點不合應付已往七十餘年中逐步演進、及最近時代復經嚴峻變動之局勢、美國政府一如往日、準備為關於上海公共租界地皮章程所需任何修正而經適當成立與進行的友好並有秩序的談判之一方面、惟美國政府不得不聲明者、就美國政府之意見觀之、上海區域之狀况、目前遠失常態、全無可望對所涉諸複雜問題獲得有秩序的解決、而使各有關方面俱獲合理的公允待遇之討論基礎、至於公共租界中之中國法院問題、有須聲明者、此項法院乃依美國為其一方面之多方面的協定而建立、並制定其地位者、對於地皮章程可能的修正之觀察、亦常施諸此項法院、</p>
<p>關於現所實行之工部局選舉制度、與夫公共租界內公共會議事、耍知按照地皮章程、對各外籍納棁人並無歧視、投票資格之至低需要、為根據每年租金白銀五百兩（的合法幣七百元）繳納之市捐、日人社會在此制度下享有大而日增重要之投票權、以事實言、日人所有票權、在總票權比例上較諸日人所納市捐與地稅對工部局所收市捐與地稅總額之比例、已高出多多矣、况日人有代表參加工部局議董會、並被僱服務於工部局之各科、</p>
<p>至於變動及改善公共租界行政機構一節、美國政府相信日本政府必能承認與公共租界行政有關之人、在租界歴史中嘗多所調整、以應付變遷中的情態美國政府信賴租界當局將繼續努力調整租界之行政機構、及其中之習慣、以迎合日本與日人利益公允而合理的願望、</p>
<p>至於日本備忘錄中所稱租界當局宜與藉日軍援助而存在於揚子江下游的各政權密切合作、要知該區域現旣無正當成立並組織的政府、租界當局巳往及現在輒作種種努力、以應付所遭甚困難的局勢中之現實、美國政府覺此輩當局理當盼望日本民事與軍政機關之各種顧念、關於此點、宜予指明者、公共租界自其最初之日起、每臨四周區域發生騷亂之時期中、要當以避免捲入因租界界錢外之事故所引起之爭執事件、為其政策、此種遠避、乃承襲租界之國際性質、而因此天然流露諾言、即在租界享有利益之列强、無論其利益若何巨大、無一應利用在他處發源之發展、歧視租界之國際性質是、</p>
<p>美國政府對租界當局雖處上海極度困苦與緊張之氛圍中、而仍以實效與精力使公共租界內處彼等有效管轄下之部分所發生之騷亂與不法事情、减至極小之度、殊為感動、美國政府茲再論及公共租界常局以往及今後繼續所作盡其正常職務之努力、此種努力時因昆連租界區域內之不法活動、及因日軍拒絕將位於蘇州河以北之租界區域、復歸公共租界當局有效管轄、致受嚴重之妨碍、並更覺棘手、</p>
<p>美國政府須促吿日本政府者、日政府若對租界當局以往及現在所為之優良工作、予以坦白之承認、並將展至蘇州河以北之租界區域之管轄全權立則交還租界當局、則必能增進租界行政機構之辦事順利、</p>
<p>總之、美國政府鑒於上海大同中心點乃經許多國之人民經營而使各方互沾其惠者、在此種發展中、公共租界實處甚重要之一部分、任何問題足以影響租界之地位與福利者、難免不牽涉許多國家、而美國亦居其列、</p>
<p>關於修正地皮章程事、美國政府就上所述、意以為此為應待較安定狀况的發展之問題、但關於租界之行政習慣、巳作許多調整、以迎合變遷中的狀况之需要、美國政府相信租界當局準備賡續彼等最佳之努力、以迎合志在續予調整之任何合理的請求、</p>

<p>此間蘇聯人士頃宣稱、蘇聯所提主張、乃由英法蘇三國訂立互助公的、並以軍事協定補充之、其他任何建議決當予以拒絕、此在英國政府接近人士則謂、蘇聯此種主張、殊非英國想像所及、張伯倫首相哈里法克斯外相霍爾內相、會於本日會談數决、聞不擬再進一步作何建議、下議院明日討論外交政策時、張伯倫首相當就現行談判困難情形、有所說明、但一切表示、凡足以阻碍英蘇兩國成立協定者、均當避去之、此間各外國觀察家則謂、國聯會行政院下星期內在日內瓦開會時、英蘇兩國代表、或可成立折衷方案、由英國接受新的的束、但英國政府當顧全保守黨意見、不與蘇聯訂立正式同盟條的云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基今晨前往外務部、與政府外交顧問在西泰爵士進行談話、歷時甚短、據聞乃係聲明、關於組織反侵略集團事、該國政府對於英國所提出之新對案、仍難接受、並堅持英法蘇三國必須訂立同盟條的、邁斯基大使巳定於今晚啟程前往日內瓦、出席國聯會行政院會議、是則英法兩國在行政院開會之前、不再賡續談判、據此間消息靈通人士宣稱、法國政府曾示意蘇聯、謂英國旣巳努力使其新對案與蘇聯觀點相接近、務望蘇聯政府加以注意云、前所談判仍陷僵局、所望法國居間幹旋之後、終能覓致折衷方法、以調和雙方見解耳、（十九日哈瓦期電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　下議院本日開會時、張伯倫首相會報吿英俄兩國談判情形、其結論云、「哈里法克斯外相定於明日前往巴黎、與法國內閣總理達拉第外交部長龐萊交換意見、相信必能覓獲切實辦法、以克服現有之障碍、余幷深信將於適常時期向下議院宜佈吾國巳與蘇聯正式訂立協定」云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>勞合喬治主張速與蘇俄立盟</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　今日下院舉行外交辯論時、首由勞合喬治發言、誠懇籲請政府與蘇聯締結「傾心同盟、」謂英法蘇聯三國此後數小時中、或在此後數日中所作之決議、其關係之重大、遠過一九一四年以還、各國所作之任何決議云、當喬治開始發言之時、蘇聯大使邁斯基適入院、就座於大使席、喬治之演說、警闢動人、注重一般人對獨裁國下决所施打擊所抱之憂懼並請衆注意彼等曾作空前之準備、喬治謂、現所得之秘密、正與一九一八年所存在者相同、其目的乃在恫嚇吾人、今欲化干戈為玉帛、其唯一之道、厥在準備英國軍隊、以應付不虞、並覓得可能抵禦侵略的各國之合作、</p>
<p>喬治述及蘇聯時、謂數方面現欲不與蘇聯共事、英國曾以保證給予波蘭羅馬尼亞、以此為軍事提案、而不邀蘇聯加入、試問下院對此將作何思乎、吾人何不從速決定主張、與蘇聯締結傾心之同盟、共條伴則與法國盟的相同、以免坐失時機乎、</p>
<p>喬治决述及獨裁國日、吾人已與彼等締結友誼協定矣、（衆大笑、）吾人現正搖動其爪矣、（反對黨歡呼、）在此一時、吾人方正或參加彼等獸性勝利之慶祝矣、（反對黨歡呼、）</p>
<p>反對黨領袖阿特里繼起發言、認喬治頃已褸述世界大局極度黯淡、但甚逼眞之景象、阿氏對政府未作建設性的努力、以求和平、而僅惶然以待下决之侵略行動、表示不滿、謂吾人必須承認軸心國之侵略政策、歐洲現有一武裝的盜匪、凖備對任何人要求「靜立而交出其所有、」</p>
<h3>張伯倫長篇演說　宣布英國政策策</h3>
<p>首相張伯倫繼阿氏起立發言時、衆皆觀呼以示敬、首相謂、渠不願在今日談外交政策、因此際為緊張憂慮懷疑之時、渠深知所發之言、不特字字將入於議員之耳、且將字字傳達全世界、而在放大鏡下研究之、今有若干惡意之人、正在等彼抓住因一時奮激所發言論之一鱗一爪、而予以發言者絕未思及之意義、阿特里頃言政府當定長期和平之政策、殖平地問題當為其一部分、當知吾人之在英國、殊不欲以讓步之代價、而購得和平、蓋讓步徒足招致此續作要求也、惟此言非謂吾人拒絕討論能饜其他各國合理的願望之什何方法、雖作對現有之事態加以調整解、亦無不可、或有數種問題、祇須保證將在好意氛圍中加以討論、而即易獲得解決、亦有許多種讓步、祇須確定此種讓步、僅用於所為給予之目的、而不用以鼓起軍略的目的、以害他之自由者、亦不難給予之、吾人非俟已對任何施於他國人民之侵略計晝、業經吾認、或予放棄、認為滿意、則討論最後和平條件、實無益可得、德政府巳宣布無侵略之意志矣、惟今日所感覺之困難、為非僅反對黨不信其言、此種地位、實由德政府自己造成之、（衆歡呼）、假使吾人能獲此種吾認、假使吾人能確信德國與其他各國間之關係、並無侵略之意志、或繼續需用武力、渠意吾人即可不專退縮、聲明吾人</p>
<h3>邱吉爾表示驚異</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　張伯倫首相頃在下議院發表演說之後、保守黨極右派領袖邱吉爾櫃之發言、對於英蘇兩國談判發生困難事、表示驚異云、英法蘇三國若果訂立同盟條的、儘可邀請他國簽字加入、其對於英土兩國商定互助協定一層、表示欣慰、幷謂英國與蘇聯訂立同盟條的、波蘭曁波羅的海沿岸各國旣不致提出異議、即西班牙葡萄牙兩國、亦未必予以贊同、愛好和平各國、訂立强有力之同盟條的、實亦促使義相墨索里尼與其夥伴分道揚鑣之良好方法、最後由外務部决官勃特勒發表演說、代表政府結束辯論、略謂英　兩國尙在賡續談判中、政府對於穌聯所具觀點、當以同情態度加以研究、此外、政府對於德國兼併波希米亞摩拉維亞兩省之舉、不擬予以承認云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）之意見、及吾人討論永久和半條件所應取之方針矣、吾國最大之利益、厥在和平之維持、一種解決而能注意其他各國與吾人自己之需要與要求及權利者、最有益於英國之利益、相信此節、即為一種國際精神渠願進商如何吾人應提出永久和平方針之問題、</p>
<p>首相父述及喬治之演詞云、渠意時局之嚴重、固不容輕視、惟喬治之言論、似屬過於悲觀、至於外傳英國發還捷克資產以利德國之風說、實完全無稽、財部不允將任何捷克之資產、交付國際淸理銀行所發還之部份、不過供給難民之少數款項而巳、首相又提及波希米亞與摩拉維亞兩地併入德國事、謂渠不知德政策府本身是否認識、此舉將引起海外之鉅大反噢、渠意尙有一事、或將較此合併土地事更使各地公衆心理感覺深切之不安者、即此種行動與德政策府時常給予全世界之莊嚴保證、適相背馳是、因此項相反之事實、已完全援動安全之感覺、並使世界發生一種普遍之情緖、即各小國之有碍於德國野心者、將不復能獲得安全是、吾人之意、茍不能提出某項新的穩定因素、則歐洲大部份之解體、項迫在眉睫、政府以為在此種環境之下、責應聯同法國出而干預、並試圖供給上述之穩定因素、且以各方對於攻擊所懷之疑懼、甚為敏銳、故有迅速行動之必要云、</p>
<p>首根續稱、吾人所給予波蘭及希臘之擔保、並非吾人心理中所有計畫之全部、吾人或可稱此項擔保為救急之方、唯欲防止局勢之繼續惡化而已、今仍需更為垂久之辦法、以增强之、並企圖向其他方面之有力或情願援助者、獲得此外之援助、渠願說明此項政策、並非受敵愾之鼓動、而使歐洲列强、列成對抗之集團、並接受戰爭為不能避免之意見、渠在戰爭開始之前、向不認其為不可避免、情形愈見黑暗、戰事爆發愈見可能之時、吾人應加倍努力、以求其避免、吾人認對抗集團之政業、極不穩固，故在根本上、非常危險、吾人所採行之政策、不含任何侵略成份、亦不排斥以友好精神從事討論各國所有參商意見之可能性、此實為一種防備之政策、只能在某種狀態之下、加以運用、此種狀熊之成立與吾、則有賴他人之力量、此叉為抵抗武力侵略之擔保、吾人希望此種侵略將永不致發生、此種政策、似屬必耍、蓋如不然、則將永無在歐洲樹立穩固觀念之景氣也、如無此項政策、貿易及企業、自將陷於停頓、人民生活之狀態亦不能有所改進、</p>
<p>首相續稱、世事轉變迅速、自不能在轉瞬之間、訂立協定、故渠意應將萬一地中海區域中、因侵略行動而引起戰爭時、英土兩國之立塲、明白表示於世界、吾人已宣言、萬一發生事端時、願彼此相互援助、共同合作、惟此項宣言之內容、審不以地中海為限、因其中承認有在巴爾幹樹立安全之必要、吾人對於所商討各事、均巳獲得妥協、結果英土兩國必將進而締結長期之條的、可無疑意云、</p>
<p>首相决又述及上項保證所造成之巨大印象、並稱、吾人在國內儘力做去、尙不足以實踐吾人所給予之担保、故亟於徵求其他國家之參加、以資協助、此吾人之所以與土耳其及蘇聯進行談話也、吾人與土耳其之討論、迅即發見兩國利益及前瞻之相同、故兩政府能於五月十二日發表宣言、此項宣言、曾受極熱烈之歡迎、一般人所表示之滿意、可表示土耳其威望之高崇及其友誼之可寳貴、首相對於土耳其致其熱烈之欽仰、並謂英土兩國之友誼、當凱末爾任總統時、業巳開始、現任總統執政之後、更見繼續增强、</p>
<p>首相又轉述英蘇之討論云、渠不禁發生其間不免稍有誤會之感想、蓋蘇聯渠前已聲明其不然、今願重申之、吾人如能發見一種方法、能因之而獲得蘇聯之合作與協助、以建立和平陣綫者、自表歡迎、因吾人需要並重視之也、吾人輕視蘇聯所能蘇聯貝加爾黑龍江鐵道建築工程副主任、頃對報界發表談話、縷述此項第三屆五年計劃中最大建築工程中一項之進行現狀、據稱、此鐵道所經過之區域、富有金·錫·煤·及其他有用礦產、而一部份地帶之森林、允為無窮無盡、此鐵道之建築將增强遠東與西比利亞之聯絡、而對於遠東及沿綫一帶工業之發展有決定的意義、現在建築工程、正在積極進行、各段業已展開浩大之炸山　道工作、常時一次炸開之山岩、竟達十萬立方公尺以上、本綫經過大小河流三千餘條、包括列那河·安加拉河·賽雅河·及黑龍江、全綫所有橋樑、苟連成一座可以由法國通至英國、　綫建築工程進行之區域、現經開發供屯墾之用、土地均經測量、將來的集體農塲村舍亦已着手建築、村落數處業已完成、其集體農塲　經分受土地、牲畜及農具以供永遠使用、不久前人跡不到之地方、今後將為繁榮的集體農業區域、該綫各段完工之時間、早經政府分別規定、明年全錢大部份當可開始通車、從此機車之吼聲將一震破森林的寂靜、而人之熱情與毅力、將在冰天雪地之間、造成驚人的交通幹綫矣、（十八日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>接張伯倫演說</h3>
<p>給予援助之說、實屬毫無根據、下院或能憶及史丹林最近所發之言論、謂蘇聯之政策、乃在援助受侵略而願保衛其獨立之國家、此正合吾人之意見、此言似足表示蘇聯或願合作、而使此舉見諸實行、惟吾人亦知之、此點迄今尙未受人重視、故蘇聯之直接參加、或不能全合為彼等而作此佈置之其他各國之志願、吾人願得各國之合作、吾人不欲各國中有任何分歧、故吾人乃向蘇聯建議、請蘇聯對於波蘭與羅馬尼亞、發一與英法相同之宣言、蘇聯顯認此種提供非屬相互性質、今欲奉吿下院者、英政府從未欲請蘇聯作吾人自己所不欲行之舉動、（衆歡呼）、英政府恒欲一切佈置皆為相互性、今所費解者、曷為認吾人之建議缺乏相互性乎、此項建議或為人認為不能包括波羅兩國外某某數國之事件、蓋彼等為蘇聯之鄰邦、或有人假道彼等之國境而攻擊蘇聯也、其實不然、此項建議並不同等施諸西歐數國、此數國如被攻擊者、吾人終必參加戰爭也、渠意上述一切、巳足表明吾人之建議、並未思及蘇聯應不論英法是吾參戰、而出干涉、惟吾人所發之保證、不論蘇聯加入與吾、已因此負有義務、此為明白之專實矣、故雙方之間苟有任何不平等存在者、此種不平等實利於蘇聯、而非利於英國也、今蘇聯顯然有所誤會、但無論有何言論指摘吾人之建議、渠敢決不能指為不公允也、然自建議為蘇聯拒絕接受後、吾人曾復專努力、吾人切欲彼此能速商獲妥協、今請下院牢記吾人在此專中所圖者、不僅為迭成英國與其他各國間之同盟、且尙有抵抗侵略之和平陣綫焉、假使保證一國之合作、而令另一國為之不安、且不願與吾人合作、則吾人之政策、卽不能成功、此事含有巨大之困難與微妙性、必須出以謹愼、此非由於主義不同而使然、亦非由於純粹固執而使然、全因吾人政策之目的、乃求造成此種和平陣錢之故、五口人奪願稍延數日、而不願操切從事、致今所已進行之工作、亦吾人之眼前粉碎之、吾人以為蘇聯或願宣布對吾人所能贊同之事件表示與吾人妥協、而準備對彼此意見參商之各問題繼續從長計議、吾人對此認為明達之途徑、但蘇聯決議不容波丹金躬臨日內瓦、實使人不勝抱憾、國聯行政院會為波氏不能即抵、而展緩一星期開會、旣展緩英、而仍不能來、致令外相哈立法克斯失去與波氏親自討論有益雙方各事件之機會、蘇聯之採取此項態度自必有其充分之理由在、渠不禁感覺兩國政府之間現有一重簾幕或牆垣相阻隔、、極難加以冲破、首相續稱、吾人在以上各項事件之經過中、會與法國有密切接觸、英法之間、並無異見、外相哈立法克斯明日將有機會、與法總理達拉第及法外長龐萊繼續討論、渠信經此商討後、或可發見有克服種種使英蘇不能妥協的障碍之可能云、（十九日路透社電）</p>

<h3>數月以來所未有　兩租界嚴重戒備　遏止政治煽動以及罪惡　防軍與探捕昨全體出動　搜檢行人住戶情勢嚴重</h3>
<p>本市兩租界當局、於前晚深夜起、突然採取各項必要戒備、所有兩租界交界各馬路里弄一律加以封鎖、僅虞洽卿路等十處可通、英美防軍曁白俄團丁均出動巡邏、並搜査行人、法租界徐家滙土山灣敎堂區域、由法水兵增防、戒備極嚴、法警務處並分派大批中西探捕、在各區里弄實施搜查住戶、情形殊見緊張、茲探誌各情如下、</p>
<p>租界戒備重要原因</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（十九日）晨據工部局某昌語記者、上海不能成政治煽動者或持械匪徒之角逐塲、若單明瞭此點、愈早愈佳云、此乃公共租界與法租界軍警義勇隊今日所戒備之原因、（外間自兩租界嚴密戒備後、謠諑繁興、今觀此消息、當可釋然、）</p>
<p>縝密計劃已歷數日</p>
<p>工部局工務處工務隊、夜間在公共租界通入愛多亞路之數馬路口、架置鐵絲網障礙物、晨五時、萬國商團接令準備出動、裝甲汽車於午餐時間、巡邏各馬路、兩租界巡捕、整日廣事搜查、法軍巡邏法租界各馬路、美國陸戰隊與英兵巡邏公共租界各馬路、兩租界當局縝密計劃、巳歷三四日、雖保持緘默、但稍有洩露、致引起驚人性質之謠諑、昨晚始決計實行所定之劃、</p>
<p>政治擾動似露徵象</p>
<p>市民於晨間出外時、見各馬路口置有鐵絲網、並有武裝士兵在路梭巡、皆為驚訝、某警務人員稱是項計劃為「練習的戒備」、頗有隨時實行之可能、邇來巳有政治性擾動之微象、故軍警努力加以遏止、如人人決作良好公民、則今所採行之辦法、公衆不致因此感受不便利云、工務處各隊自午夜開始在各道路架置鐵絲網、預定開放交通之各馬路口、則架可移動之障碍物、但有巡捕隊駝守其地、實施搜查、工務處為迅速架設障碍物起見、多處均用圓形而非長方之鐵絲網、蓋載送　易也、</p>
<p>搜查結果多人被捕</p>
<p>巡捕隊在各要點搜查行人及車輛中人、至於滬西「歹土區」、亦有强勁巡捕隊在公共租界各路口搜查行人、截至今日屬稿時為止、關於被捕人數、尙未能獲得官方之宜佈、惟衆信當已獲嫌疑犯數名、抄獲手槍數枝、法租界自晨六時起、在各區中搜查住宅、預料將整日繼續搜查、法國義勇隊隊員今晨亦出動、駕駛警務處所用之輕裝甲車者頗多、法租界特別巡捕巳準備待命、預料彼等今晚將出動、接簪正規巡捕隊、</p>
<p>交介各處實施封銷</p>
<p>自日軍在鼓浪嶼登陸後、本巿兩租界情勢、突趨緊張、但經英美兩國之嚴正表示後、日來業巳轉見緩和、乃昨晨零時三十分起、公共租界當局突將沿愛多亞路及福煦路之內租界交界之各馬路里弄、一律佈置鐵絲網、實施封鎖、採取必要戒備、昨晨各路交通、多吿阻斷、僅外灘·四川路·河南路·浙江路·虞洽卿路·同孚路·馬霍路·威海衛路·西摩路·海格路等十處可通、但均經加派中西探捕、分駐各路口、對法租界進入公共租界之車輛及行人、一律實施搜查、其情形猶如去年「八一三」滬戰紀念日、又沿蘇州河一帶橋樑、除老垃圾橋僅派探捕駐守外、其餘各橋、亦均佈置鐵絲網、僅留孔道、容許行人出入、</p>
<p>駐軍探捕出動巡邏</p>
<p>駐滬英美防軍曁白俄團丁及捕房方面中西探捕、昨均全體出動、自外灘至虞洽卿路一段、由英軍担任警戒、白俄團丁、亦分乘裝甲汽車梭巡各馬路、滬西接近越界築路地段、則美國駐軍派兵防守、並携有機關槍及自動步槍、往返巡查、戒備至為嚴密、同時各捕房派出大批探捕、分駐各重耍路口、搜查行人、</p>
<p>法水兵增防土山灣</p>
<p>滬西徐家滙路土山灣天主堂區、於國軍西撤時、會由法當局徵得國民政府曁市政府同意、劃入法租界管轄、最近日方曾向法當局抗議、要求交還該區、但業經法當局嚴詞拒絕、法國駐軍當局為防患未然計、咋晨特派法水兵二百名、馳往該區增防、同時法捕房並加派華法越俄等探捕七十餘名、協同駐守、戒備異常嚴密、法捕房中西探捕、並在孝友里·海格里·徐家滙鎭老街·及海格路·虹橋路·一帶、向商店住家挨戶搜查、同時法國駐滬海軍陸戰隊、及鐵甲隊、往來梭巡、並檢查行人車輛、土山灣天主堂及虹橋路封鎖綫口、防務允為嚴密、臨時加派雙崗、週圍佈鐵置絲網、</p>
<p>法租界搜查各住戶</p>
<p>法警務處於昨晨分令所屬各區捕房全體警務人員、一律出動、分赴各馬路里弄、搜查商店住戶、自法租界外灘起、沿公館馬路·霞飛路·福煦路·以迄亞爾培路一帶、各路里弄居戶、均經分頭搜查、並對居戶姓名職業、加以盤詰、大自鳴鐘中滙大樓、咋日下午三時許、亦遭搜檢、但結果未有所獲、此外鐵甲車隊機器車巡隊、暨法國駐滬海軍陸戰隊、亦奉命一律出動、在各馬路巡邏、並搜查往來行人、</p>
<p>萬國商團全體準備</p>
<p>公共租界工部局警務處、所屬各捕房之中外籍警務人員、現已不準請假、常川駐守捕房、以便調遣、義務性質之特別巡捕、亦巳召集、至於萬國商團方面、經常出動者原為白俄團丁之B字大隊、的三百餘人、惟昨晨七時、萬國商團總司令亨培業巳發出準備命令、如騎兵隊A字大隊、（即英格蘭隊·蘇格蘭隊·猶太隊·防空隊等、）B字大隊、（即美國隊·菲律濱隊·美國機關槍隊·等、）各國團員的二千左右、限令準備出動、在接獲出動命令時、五分鐘內、即須集合、聽候調遺、</p>
<p>各項措施維護治安</p>
<p>自兩租界當局、於昨日起採取緊急戒備後、本市原巳鬆弛之情勢、復驟趨緊張、一般市民乃多紛加揣測、但據記者向關係方面探悉、兩租界昨日所採之措置、完全為維護界內之良好秩序、與保護居民之安寗、並無任何特殊事件、足以引起驚惶、又關於宵禁時間、咋晚無變更、衆信如非情勢必要、則不致提早戒備、但警務處於晚間、則當加緊戒備也、</p>
<p>兩租界嚴密戒備</p>

<h3>租界局勢緊張中　日領定期返滬　日報紀述日方之企圖　對租界猶有進佔可能</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（十八日）晚日文大陸新報載稱、日總領事三浦今在東京與日政府各領袖會談、五月二十七日返抵此間後、日本關於公共租界問題之政策、似將起新發展、此間當局對公共租界之態度、頃巳達「最後階段」、東京政府官吏、亦巳決定</p>
<p>基本政策策</p>
<p>從而「澈底改革公共租界狀况、適應新局勢」、三浦刻正與外務省官員會談關於公共租界之事件、及華中之其他問題、將乘上海丸返滬云、日方陸海軍發言人昨日招待各報記者時聲稱、如公共租界中發生與日方利益相牴觸之</p>
<p>重大事件</p>
<p>日軍將進佔公共租界、又稱「重大事件」將引起巨大之軍隊行動、越蘇州河各橋而入南岸云、按發言人因各記者詢問關於本市賭塲中起糾紛事而發此言、又謂日本陸海軍巳下決心、對於華人之愛國主義、其治療之法、厥唯統治公共租界或法租界、如今之</p>
<p>統治虹口</p>
<p>然發言人又稱、如果發生重大事件時、日軍被迫而入公共租界、非不可能者、舌人復稱、海軍發言人於兩週前已表示此種情勢、陸軍發言人意見今與彼相同、日大使發言人稱、虹口與楊樹浦交還公共租界當局管轄事、進行將甚遲緩」、工部局</p>
<p>恢復管理</p>
<p>蘇州河北區、進行頗多障碍、日方目的之一、即為「維持和平與秩序、」有詢一九三七年八月前不有和平與秩序乎、發言人答觀於一九三七年戰前、日本軍人在虹口被暗殺者不少、故不能謂該地有和平與秩序云、發言人出此言論、乃因華盛頓方面宣佈拒絕日方修改上海公共租界</p>
<p>地皮章程</p>
<p>俾工部局准添日人代表之要求而起、昨日又據英商會主席馬歇爾爵士聲稱、余意、美國拒絕日方修改地皮章程的要求之解釋、乃對此間局勢、發為甚公允之言論、除非全部公共租界歸還統一之管理、不能恢復常態云、</p>
<h3>美艦今晨抵滬</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國亞洲艦隊潛艇保護艦加諾普斯號與潛艇S-38自馬尼刺駛滬、明日（二十日）晨六時可抵埠、將泊浦江浮筒、又美艦阿許維爾、定今日午前十時三十分離滬駛華南、</p>
<h3>被架五華人並未釋放</h3>
<p>五華人被架一案、據日方發言人聲稱、業巳釋放、記者特詳加調查、該五華人迄今尙未返家、仍被禁扣於虹口、所謂釋放一節、殊屬疑問、</p>
<h3>肉業今晨復巿　巿場肉價已趨穩定　客商竭力流通來源</h3>
<p>鮮猪行業接受租界當局之勸導、已於昨日起復業、先儘存猪稱售、惟仍堅守原來之立塲、拒絕參加任何非法組織、法租界宰牲公司及公共租界新寗海及蘇錫兩宰牲公司、已於昨晚恢復宰猪、全市鮮肉同業、準今日起一律復業售肉、昨日肉市、因鮮猪業復業、肉價巳趨穩定、同業折價每元一斤十二兩、門售腿肉一斤三兩、五花每元一斤五兩、至於連日裝日德意各輪運滬之猪、的有一二千頭、幸求遭虹口「牲畜市塲」扣留、聞客商竭力設法疏通來源、以維兩租界之民食問題、決不受任何阻撓、繼續接受承運、</p>

<h3>米巿紊亂已極　當局亟應澈查　限價已無方法執行　惟蕪湖米確已弛禁</h3>
<p>上海豆米市塲、因囤戶之投機操縱、米價飛漲、逾越限價、管理委員會無法執行取締、以致造成嚴重之局面、米價飛漲、限價名存寔亡、昨將經過情形、呈報豆米行業公會、請籌善後方法、今蕪湖巳弛禁、米商訂購洋米、故整個民食暫可無虞、茲分誌詳淸於后、</p>
<p>限價失效巿塲紊亂</p>
<p>豆米巾塲牽令頒佈罰則、嚴厲執行限價、取締暗盤交易之後、連日因囤戶之投機操縱、致頭號白米漲至十七元以上、中决各米、均逾限價、所有一百零五家行號、均視暗盤交易為正式之營業、以致市塲管理委員會無法執行罰則、市塲之紊亂情形、為歷來所罕見、造成最嚴重之問題、惟每日成交數目、至由數千包增至一萬餘包、</p>
<p>暗盤呈報無法取締</p>
<p>巿塲管理委員會主席符前耕、於前日突接得一恐嚇函件、大意謂「米價成本高昂、運滬之米、受限價影響、以致虧耗頗鉅、如敢再嚴厲執行限價、則我輩勢必無法營業、故望從速放棄執行政策、吾則、決以嚴厲手段對付」、於是市塲各委員當即召集會議、將經過情形、已呈報豆米行業公會、請速妥籌善後辦法、以維滬市民食、</p>
<p>誥誡米行最為上策</p>
<p>敬啟者、接展大函、以暗盤逾限之發生、賣方之抬價出售、固屬不合、而買方之放價購進、咎亦相等、請誥誡各米號、幸母放價購進、並希望各米號盡量舉發等因、敬悉、查市塲越價暗盤、愈趨愈烈、巳為不可掩之事實何待舉發、昨日市塲喊出價盤、巳至十七元七角、此等情形、尋根究底、端由賣方主動、而買方聽市報價、如賣方無越限抬價之喊出、則買方亦決無放價購進而在門市虧本售出之理、處現在局勢之下、欲澄淸市塲暗盤、最有效之辦法、惟有還請貴會嚴切誥誡各米行、不作逾限抬價之舉、庶幾限價可望維持、暗盤交易、一掃而淸、至尊囑誥誡各米號勿放價購進一節、敝會認為關係重大、緣米號直接供應全市民食、倘因此而無米應銷、發生恐慌、以致影響治安時、貴會能負完全責任者、敝會自當遵囑、通吿各米號絕對不得逾限買進、吾則徒事文飾、於事實無補也、專此布復、此致上海市豆米行業同業公會、上海市米號業同業公會啟、</p>
<p>米號同業闡明眞相</p>
<p>逕啟者、閱報見載貴會致敝業公會函、誦悉之下、不勝詫異、爰有數言願為貴會吿、幸垂察焉、查敝業係與食戶直接接觸之銷貨者、必有貨而後可以應市、決不能以今日之所需、今日購進、明日所需者、明日購進、此衆所共知之事實也、况米品繁多、全顧取舍無定、多備者或去路有限、少備者適銷路甚廣、任何米號亦決不能旬日而不謀添補者、此亦貴會所熟知者也、現今米市、囤戶競相放價、暢辦之下、逾限巳及半月、而欲敝業各號凜乎遵守應市限價、而粒合不購、此非事理之所能、而亦事實之所必不可能者也、而貴會不謀制止囤戶之操縱壟斷、（貴會會員、亦有不少囤積者、）而反責敝業會員不能堅持不買而使賣出者、雖欲逾限而不可得云云、若敝業准遵尊函所云、堅持不進、則將存店之米傳罄之後、造成市民發生極大恐慌之時、試問貴會能吾負其全賣、况賣方抬價囤方放價、權均操於貴會會員、豈敝業所得而干預、貴會會員若不為已及囤戶猛力吸收與囤積、則米價未必趨於今日之高潮、明於責人、昧於責己、貴會捫心自問、其亦無愧於孤島四百萬之市民乎、更有言者、自戰事爆發、滬市會經數度米荒、若非兩租界當局竭力維持、曷克度此難關、客歲農事豐收、本市來源甚湧、米價因而回平、當此之時、正可預儲以備不時之需、以免再有如前决之米荒發現、而不此之圖、實因貴會諸領袖兼營轉口業者、乘此米價回平之候、大量轉口、而又自定限價十四元、以博美名、並謂高白粳至限則停止轉口云云、敝業以彼時正在出新之時、信任貴會、不慮有他、不料至今產地之貨巳枯、兼之運輸困難、產地價高、來源銳减、而滬市仔底又薄、加之貴業及囤戶猛力放價吸收、故雖於本月五日聯席會議決放限一元、而仍不堪收拾者、實貴會有以致之、敝業年來含辛茹苦、門售米價、勉力盡其義務、捫心自問、以為可吿無愧、乃報載尊函、遽加責問、茲為辯明事實眞相起見、則自難緘默、伏希貴會母以空言責人、以蒙蔽衆聽、應消弭狼狽陰計、善自的束、則米價回平之望、其庶幾焉、此致上海市豆米行業同業公會、南昌米號、恒昇公米號、裕昌米號、信義興米號、五豐泰米號、福昌米號、大昌米號、三陽米號、信盛和米號等同啟、</p>
<p>整個民食暫可無虞</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向市塲方面探悉、市塲米價飛漲之原因、果為囤戶操縱、但上海租界戒嚴、以致市民粉紛預購、連日各米店營業倍增、鬥市大有應接不暇之勞、頭號白米售價、竟每石漲至十七元七角、此種現象、實為滬市之不幸、但最近之國米運滬、並未中斷、雖較前减少、然此為靑黃不接時必有之現象、存底尙豐、整個民食、暫可無虞、</p>
<p>蕪湖弛禁秈米充足</p>
<p>米業團體竭力設法疏通來源之後、關於蕪湖之禁米出境、經米商交涉之後、弛禁業已證實、惟無錫等處、仍禁白米出境、所以上海最近杜米異常缺乏、秈米則尙稱充足、以後之秈米及杜米價格、將背道而馳、或將造成杜米成為目前市塲上之糯米、</p>
<h3>大美報請提出交涉</h3>
<p>美商大美報自被工部局吊銷執照後、該報除呈請美國領事提出交涉外、仍照常出版、以示抗議、昨日捕房雖阻止該報發行、但該報決繼續奮鬥、以候合理正當之解決、</p>
<h3>日圓價値已低於法幣　昨晨以法幣九角八分三兌換店即購進日金一圓</h3>

<p>英文大美晚報云、四川路華方兌換店、今（十九日）晨以法幣九角八分三買進日金一元、而以九角八分七售出、朝鮮銀行紙幣兌換率允低、上海日方官塲因日元跌價、乃促請此間日人節的、藉以支持漸趨荏弱之日元、並將努力</p>
<p>防杜日元</p>
<p>大量流入蘇州河南岸、據日方官塲稱、日元大量南流、乃係日元在滬荏弱之附屬起因、此外、復將採取限制游滬日人人數之辦法、及從嚴監督船隻及其他載送方法、防杜日元自華北與東三省運來上海、日本大藏省駐滬事務官某氏定明日（二十日）離滬赴日、與政府官員商談此後</p>

<p>（一）兒童保護股案　美國社交會堂董事會曾致工部局一函、略稱、本會為參加救濟貧苦兒童工作起見、擬聘用社會工作事務員一名、歸工部局兒童保護股指揮服務、仟期至少一年、倘所擬計劃、成效卓著，當予延長、本年內所需該員薪金及其他事務費用、業經本會籌措二千元等語、警備委員會議決擬請局方批准該會堂所擬辦法、各委員會謂根據兒童保護股上月份所載各項事實、脫離本生父母而受他人蹂躪之兒童、應如何保護、為一重大之問題、辦理保護事務之職員、如增加人數、當然大有裨益、允以着手創辦之時為然、工部局一方面指揮該會堂所荐職員、一方面與該會堂密切聯絡、以資合作、此項建議、業經董事會核准、</p>
<p>（二）酒館執照案　上年十月間、有人擬於四川路六八一號設立酒館、向工部局請領執照、旋因海軍靑年會得美國總領事之贊助、提出抗議、工部局乃不准在該處開設酒館、該陳請人茲又擬於同一房屋內沿蘇州路之一面開設酒館、海軍靑年會復經美國總領事之贊助、表示反對、同時另有人擬在四川路六二五號即海軍靑年會對過、開設酒館、請領臨時執照、局方以此案一經公布、定遭反對、於是將兩案一併交警備委員會審查、海軍靑年會認為該會所附近、如有出售酒類之處所、定與曾務有害、美總領事亦表同意、警備委員會鑒於此項意見、尙有理由、且四川路一帶、巳有售酒塲所、議決擬請董事會准如海軍靑年會所請、拒發執照、此項建議當經董事會通過、</p>

<h3>警務處應日方之請　捕華人陸次山　被指為與游擊隊有關　日文報上載可疑廣吿</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨（十八日）悉、公共租界警務處應日當局之請、派探員於星期日午後四時、逮捕華人陸决山（譯音）、陸寓七浦路二二七號、聞為家境富裕之地產主、今押福州路總捕房、聞陸因被指與游擊隊</p>
<p>活動有關</p>
<p>故而被捕、惟渠於以往四日內受鞠訊時、吾認於政治上有何聯絡、此案頗為神秘、因上週間、本埠日文大陸新報上刊有廣吿、招請日籍助手一人、應徵者可撥某號發電話云云、該</p>
<p>電話號碼</p>
<p>係陸之寓所、應徵日人發電話者、不乏其人、陸氏吾認刋登是項廣吿、卒訴諸電話公司、謂渠接得顯非致彼之電話、為數日增、不勝其煩擾云、當局刻正繼續查詢此案、</p>
<h3>舉辦蠶繭貨款　偽方仍擬統制　廠商不予合作</h3>
<p>江浙春繭、次第上市、浙江省油茶棉絲管理處、為扶助繭商救濟蠶晨起見、特貸放蠶繭貸款一百五十萬元、以貸放足額為度、並訂定貸款辦法及手續、責令各縣收繭商組織收繭集團、避免無謂競爭、凡各繭商欲在蕭山·諸曁·紹興·嵊縣·新昌·上虞·蘭谿·及富陽南鄕等處、收購蠶繭而缺乏資金者、遵照規定辦法及手續、逕向該處申請貸款、須自備二成現金墊頭、取具殷實商號保結、就近向各該主管管理絲繭辦事處塡呈貸款申請書、經該處核准後、發給核准貸款通知書、貸款人即可憑此項通知書、逕向該處絲繭部辦理簽訂合同支款等手續、並悉是項貸款月息、普通繭商定為九厘、合作社聯合社减為七厘、</p>
<p>偽方統制</p>
<p>偽組織因去年統制計劃失敗、本年僅統制蘇省一區、由偽「江蘇建設廳」通吿、凡欲在江蘇省淪陷區收買春繭者、須於五月二十日前先行登記、乾繭每市担、收保證金三元、每一單灶以十五市担計算、惟迄截止期僅三日、廠商前往登記採辦者、為數寥寥、繭行開秤、較前大减、</p>
<p>燒燬繭廠</p>
<p>浙省繭絲、為農村之唯一副業、故其產量為全國冠、自沿鐵路公路各地域淪陷後、繭廠房屋大部燬於砲火、存者寥寥無幾、華方游擊隊、因恐淪陷區絲繭、被統制收買後、為人所用、故最近將酆市廟長安等各地剩餘之繭廠繭灶、盡行燒燬、近期內勢難建造、本年度春繭、如此庶可使鄕人無從出售、而自行繅製、</p>
<h3>海關日籍稅務司怖吿限制航輪結關　未得日軍許可證不得結關　各國航商又遭胎神非法束縛</h3>

<h3>閩海復航　新疆輪開泉州　利生輪開福州</h3>
<p>閩省海面前因日艦集積達二十餘艘、日機亦不時飛往福州泉州投彈轟炸、形勢緊張、頃據航業界接得報吿、閩海日艦一部份已他去、惟閩江口外、現仍有日艦三艘停泊、日機不時飛往偵察、沿海情形尙稱安謐、人心鎭定、上海至泉州航錢、常局為防務關係、曾暫禁通航、茲據新新社記者向航業界探悉、現該處情形已轉和緩、航業界為疏通客貨、巳呈准當局准許復航、英商新疆輪定二十三日首决開往泉州復航、英商怡和洋行利生輪、定十九日開往福州、惟此班不擬淤灣興化、</p>
<h3>美砲般兩艘定期拆毀</h3>
<p>大陸報云昨（十八日）悉、英國六四五噸級之砲艦蟋蟀號與螳螂號、在中國各江服役、幾已二十年、茲定下月問出售拆毀、而由新式砲艦蜻蜓號與蚱蜢號瓜代、兩新艦定下月中旬來滬、預料其中之蚱蜢號、巳於今日（十九日或明日駛抵香港决日蜻蜓號亦可抵港、停怕兩星期、而運兵艦杜納拉號、亦定六月中旬抵滬、載來瓜代官兵的二百人、</p>
<h3>英艦陶賽夏號　突然離滬</h3>

<h3>中國中學敎育概况（一）</h3>
<p>中學劃區設立限制組製濫造　新增經費儘先撥充職業師範</p>
<p>（重慶特訊）全國中等敎育之學校敎員學生經費等項之戰前總數、以及戰後敎部新設國立各中學、及敎師服務團概况、曾先後刋誌本報、茲將敎部十年來對於中學之整個制度和辦法、摘要探錄於下、</p>

<h3>上海保護牲畜會之宗旨及工作</h3>
<p>自人類對於牲畜痛苦日漸了解及同情之後，世界各國於是有保護牲畜會之組織，其規模多由簡陋而漸臻完善焉。所謂牲畜之，實包括各種走獸飛禽魚類，無論家畜及野生者俱是。虐待牲畜之事或出於有意，或出於無意，或因無知，或因經濟之因素。最後之一原因乃常見於中國者也。此等會社之目的其始也多以當地情形為對象。易言之，凡當地所有各種虐待牲畜之事設法减少，而對無主之野生者予以仁慈之處置。自會社之力量增强後，活動範圍已大為擴充矣。</p>
<p>從過去人道事業上所得之知識而推知，活動之方法可總述如下：</p>
<p>一，倡導關於屠宰牲畜須人道化之立法。</p>
<p>二，禁止及管理動物之解剖。</p>
<p>三，改良誘捕禽獸之方法。</p>
<p>四，保護及扶助遷居之禽烏，允其對於在海岸上者。本會之老前輩皇家會社（Royal　Society）即將在國聯會提出禁止用油類作燃料之火輪在離海岸若干距離之內拋棄燃油之議案。因每年之間不下有數千海烏皆因羽毛被油浸着不能起飛，致飢困而逐漸歿亡。</p>
<p>五，用適當之文字及演講以敎導羣衆。</p>
<p>六，栽培兒童以人道敎育。</p>
<p>七，工作活動之普遍宣傳。</p>
<p>此項活動乃屬國際性質，國際會議時有定期召集，俾資交換意見，及互磋工作之調整。且更有一種帶國際性之刋物出版，頗具感化能力。每年十月四日稱為「禽獸日」，屆時歐美各國皆有慶祝。</p>
<p>上述乃係關於一般保護牲畜會之活動。茲當就上海本會之活動事情略述之。上海本會之起源殊奧渺難以追溯，的創辦於三十年以前。其時會審公堂在上海行使職權，因而上海工部局擬定若干關於人道之律例，附之於市塲及車輛執照章程之內。該章程由會審公堂執行，遇有罰金，則送繳本會。後因會審公堂取消，而當時中國法律叉無禁止虐待牲畜之條例，對於處罰曾感極大困難，是以當時本會工作之活動致蹉跎歲月，至一九三二年時祇留高級職員一名及會員的二十名而已。（數年之中旣無辦公處又無調查員及報吿文件之發行）該年春季因戰事殘暴行為之結果，實無慮有數千頭之牲口遭遇流亡飢餓殘害之痛苦，社會之同情不僅及於流亡之難民，且亦及於無法可逃之牲畜。當時警務當局不克顧及此項問題，於是具有活動能力之保護牲畜會，便成事實之需要，頗為活躍矣。本會乃從事改組革新，直至一九三三年已頗見進步，且能聘任一受半職之秘書矣。本會自一九三二年以後，會員已由二十名躍進至八百名之多，且力能聘任全職之秘書及著制服之調查員各一名。本會又設辦事處於上海跑馬總會內，租費概免，此實不得不向該會致謝者也。此外又承熱心保護牲畜事業之奧斯丁爵士捐贈救護卓一輛，於是遇有疾病傷害之牲畜，得而逕送至獸醫院處治，本會之調查員亦得以擴展調查之區域。一九三六年本會之季刊方始誕生，出版以來頗予本會宜傳部以助力。在最近四年之問，上海本會實為全世界此等會社最有活動能力者之一。</p>
<p>木會之組織無分國界，完全公開，吾等之目的在盡力使之普遍化國際化，目下本會會員包括最少有十五國籍之人士。如張籋雲先生生前即為本會執行委員之一。關炯之院長在滬時，對於本會事務極感興奮，每事俱願襄助。本會對於上述兩位中國人士，實懷無上感謝之意。本會之宗旨，略述之可如决：即欲提高中國尤其上海一區對於牲畜之人道化待遇，在可能範圍之內以敎育，勸導，促進法律，救護牲畜受苦為執行之宗旨。經濟生活之低劣常引成無情感之形態，而致對於牲畜之痛苦無動於中；是以家畜之所以為過度工作及漠視之犧牲者，並非出於主人太心之不良，缺乏思想力，實為共因素。因法律之足資憑藉者殊微，本會之工作須受限制，乃不得不仗於勸導及敎育羣衆之工作，以喚醒個人對於牲畜之了解為當務之急；次即闡明保護牲畜之立法之重耍。其實本會之宗旨極為簡單，即欲創造一堅固發揚之社會意識，俾對於牲畜之苦難有仁慈之觀念，再用勸導之法，以求暴虐行為之剷除。</p>
<p>然則或問曰：貴會目下巳辦之工作究竟如何？本會實不敢過於自誇，謂本會之大部份工作係致力於敎導方面，惟該項工作確已有成效。管理本市區者有數個分權獨立之當局，而大部份可以禁絕之牲畜苦難惟仗各該當局之同情行動方可。近年來各當局亦己施行不少深造之改進工作，此項改進工作本會固不能盡引為己譽，但各當局之肯悉心考慮本會經常所提出之建議，亦足證明本會有存在之必要也。然有數項改進工作之成功，乃羣衆對牲畜幸福漸感興趣之結果，此本會可分擔一部分之榮譽者也。</p>
<p>上巳述及本會聘有一穿制服之調查員，該員之工作實非閒逸者。如有不信者，該員頗歡迎其能於渠工作時，隨同監伴。該員巡視各市塲，查察各豢狗欄及醫科學校，監視水陸運輸之起卸牲畜，及追踪有人吿發虐待牲畜之事件。且常須對於不可醫治之無主猫允予以人道化之死滅，以免其受無限之痛苦。本會又一調查員工作，為巡視各個牲口之屠塲，自牲口起送至解進屠房，莫不予以密切注視。渠監導對於牲口之人道待遇，如代舊法殘酷之牽鼻環以繫繩於角上，月須予以適宜之飲料。調查員又注意運輸車輛中之豬隻，及筐籮中之雞鴨，是吾太擠。往往因提示此等違犯執照上不合人道條例於警員，乃得罰款之結果。然此項罰款已非繳納於本會矣。本會且常贈與有助於此等事之中國警員小小酬勞焉。</p>
<p>本會希望最近立法能有搬運牲口，如羊，乳牛等類，須用車輛裝載之條例。因在市區道路上用蹄着地行走，實為一殘酷之事，允在天氣炎熱之時。下述一最顯明之例可以因懲禁而得除去者，此事曾見報章，想已為諸君閱悉者矣。即豬鬃毛一物，人所盡知，乃可作貨品換錢者。於是趕豬者及屠手倘遇豬隻在手時，莫不在活豬隻上拔鬃毛，以增加些微之進益，牲口因受此種待遇所受痛苦，實無庸想像而知。本會調查員某决因目睹此等事件，立即拘留該負責之苦力，並吿以「禍害」之罪。「禍害」之罪名實包括許多種類之罪惡，本會當時即急欲知此等殘暴之行為，是吾亦可以加此罪名。及時，該案在地方法庭開審，經各種證據俱已陳述之後，法官竟認為不受理。於是工部局律務助理員，即申請更改控訴意旨為「盜竊」之罪名—盜竊豬隻主人所有物之豬鬃毛。至於該苦力之辯辭則為彼無工資，祇靠拔鬃毛為其所得之酒資而已。當庭豬隻主人即駁斥其辭，謂該苦力實有每月十四元之工資者。於是法官乃得科以刑罰。事後最可注意者，即數日之後，警務當局未經本會通知，竟亦拘捕一同樣之罪犯，且收相同之結果。上述之事本會引以為最重要者，乃科罰之後，調查員在市區內即不復見有同樣事件發生矣。此在昔日蓋為司空見慣之事也。有人謂此不過作弄一無知這苦力而已，然因而得獲實際及有價値之效果，　非快事。上述之事可證明如有可得控訴該項罪犯之法律存在時，科罰當可獲效者也。</p>
<p>至此又須鄭重聲明者，本會實非欲專事尋覓罪犯予以科罰，乃擬用敎育及勸導之方法，以拔犯罪者於無知之深淵中也。在極多之事例中殘暴行為之施行者，蓋往往毫不自知能造成可怖之痛苦者。此類事件最大之內在原因，無疑乃係經濟生活之困苦，於是理想能力自亦消沉矣。但有時頗多專肆殘暴之人，祇有刑罰方能使之戢悟。</p>
<p>證明須要有效之立法之事例不勝枚舉。趕猪隻之人日常俱用有可怖銳鈎之長棒為驅策之具，此等銳鈎刺入猪隻耳鼻膚肉之內，致與殘酷之痛苦，但此非法律之罪惡，無可申訴者也。鷄鴨之携帶往往反握雙翅於其背上，因而骨節脫落，致與鉅大之痛楚，但人人俱以此乃携帶鷄鴨之常法，當亦不犯律例者也。最近某僕役毆斃一貓，但此貓乃無主者，不能治之以罪者也。諸君或尙能記憶報章上曾載關於「老兵士」之新聞。老兵士為一英國之軍用馬，係上海防軍所遺下者，輾轉入於某佞徒之手，以致强策之工作於可怖辛勞情况之下，將至於死而後已。其實如可得而死，亦佳，蓋自茲可從痛苦之中解放矣。最後經數百同情者之贈賜，乃得集資為該老馬覓一安息之所，以悮晚境；此老馬之得改進其生活，實為若干施恩人士之所賜也。該老馬之劣主人，又畜有驢兩頭，經調查員發見，正在工作於飢餓，尪　，皮肉糜爛之情况下，於是主人即被拘訴於法庭，科以過度勞役羸弱牲畜之罪而罰金。此外叉命其償付獸醫院之醫藥費，並須任該驢休養三星期。最後該主人因執行命令之費用過鉅，竟將兩驢送與本會，另用他法作為運輸之用焉。本會最近又發見一法軍老馬，遭遇同樣命運，現巳設法挽救之，並給與良好之安息所。</p>
<p>對於在中國狩捕供製皮毛之獸類情形，如詳述之，實堪驚人。最不幸者，因狩捕之地區多在本會活動範圍之外，致絕少工作可得致力執行；但本會一向戮力栽培之羣衆意識，勢將警醒而倡導有關之律例，以應付是項問題也。說及皮毛，歐美仕女對於胎羊皮瘋在之愛好（此風聞巳漸戢），使此等皮毛之價格銳漲。胎羊皮之製造法極為殘酷，此等皮毛必須取自當胎羊在母體內毛髪尙未長足成熟之前，因欲使胎羊未足月而誕生，即用棍棒鞭撻母羊腹部兩側，直至獲得預期之效果乃止。此種待遇往往致母羊於死命，但以胎羊皮毛其價値甚昂，母羊之生死蓋不足道也。胎羊皮旣由是而獲得，浙江省在某時期內曾因此而使羔羊絕跡。後禁止胎羊皮出口之立法已建議成立，並予嚴厲執行，其風始戢。此項結果一部份乃因本會之努力，但上海皮毛業公會實為禁止此事之重要機關也。倘婦女中一思此等皮毛製作時之殘暴情况，而仍能披擁者，則殊屬不解矣。</p>
<p>本會對與兒童以仁慈待牲畜之敎育，未嘗忘懷，故當在學校時輙心論文及演說競賽之方法以灌輸待禽獸仁慈之敎義。本會之季刋關一兒童攔，且印有美觀之徵章，以供兒童備帶。述及兒童敎育，有一錯誤觀念亟應在此予以更正者，木會深知本市區內瘋犬之可怖，故從未敎導兒童處理無主之貓犬。</p>
<p>上述一切想閱者諸君巳悉木會所推行之各種工作如何矣。然每項工作皆需費用，木會所恃者，惟各界之自動捐款耳。倘諸君願意協助此種人道工作者，可加入為本會會員。一年會費祇須國幣五元，如一决付國幣二十元，則可成為終身會員矣。如無意加入者，隨意捐助，亦所歡迎。凡會費及捐款，須請移玉至本埠馬霍路一八四號上海保護牲畜會秘書處繳交為感。</p>

<p>陸上交通　巿區陸上交通工具，就公共者言，有電車，公共汽車，與長途汽車三種。（一）電車。電車事業為華商電氣公司所經營，行駛路綫四路，計長二三·二四公里，備有電車五十四輛，拖車二十七輛。該公司之第三路環城圓路，在民國十七年以前，本分為兩橛，於老西門及小東門地方，各為起迄，乘客往來，均須中途換車，殊感不便。經市公用局飭令接軌，改為圓路，於十七年下半年通車。第二路電車，亦經該局督促，於二十二年改為圓路。（二）公共汽車。華商公共汽車公司於十七年間，與市府簽訂合的，取得全市區內經營公共汽車事業權利。是年十一月，先就閘北通車。「一二八」事變起，該公司損失殊鉅，嗣經充實資本，添置車輛，為捲土重來計。逮市政府遷入市中心區之後，復由該公司放車行駛。截至二十六年夏，共有汽車三十四輛，行駛路綫五路，共長五三·二公里。滬南方面之公共汽車，曾於十七年十月，由滬南公共汽車公司放車行駛，第該公司經營不善，於二十年年底，宣吿停業。至二十三年四月，由市公用局繼續辦理，並擴充路綫至浦東及滬西漕河涇一帶。二十六年夏止，備有汽車四十五輛，行駛路錢五路，共長四六·五公里。（三）長途汽車。往來於上海市與鄰縣問之長途汽車公司，計有：錫滬長途汽車公司，滬太長途汽車公司，租辦滬閔南拓長途汽車綫交通公司，上松長途汽車公司，上南交通公司，上川交通公司等六家，前四家之車輛，均為公共汽車。後二家鋪築鋼軌，行駛蒸汽機車。年來業務，均稱發達。至不定路綫之各種車輛，截止二十五年年底，在市公用局登記者，共有一〇六·八八七輛。</p>
<p>龍華飛行港　龍華飛行港位於龍華鎮東，浦江之濱，機塲面積凡一千二百餘畝，為上海巿之民用水陸飛機塲。前經巿政府擴充建築之後，於二十四年十一月，交由巿公用局組織管理處接管。先後佈置航站設備，如飛機起飛時之馳道，係用水泥鋪設；安置飛機之倉庫，以及辦公室等。飛機起落，與旅客上下，頗稱便利·水機碼頭吸夜航設備等，本亦在設備之中，惜受戰事影響，成為泡影矣。塲內設有中國，及歐亞兩航空公司之廠屋。中國航空公司之航綫，山上海出發，南至廣州，北達北平，西接成都及昆明。歐亞綫，由上海至鄭州後，北接北平，南至廣州，西至西安；再由西安至昆明或蘭州；蘭州北平間，中經包頭，亦通航。據二十五年年底統計，龍華飛行港往來飛機决數及旅客人數，以十月份為最高，計來往决數一百七十五次，旅客人數為一千二百人。（未完）</p>

<p>昨日現　巿况、仍不脫醖釀之局、客路交易　似較前兩日為活、北洋帮以天津申滙穩定、零星需要略增、惟整票去化尙難開展、南洋帮亦以汕頭方面時局緊張、進胃不强惟本街零批交易、逐見活潑、良以本埠租界形勢日緊、及米價拾級上升、人心未免引起恐怖、糧食一途、不無連帶關係、故昨日二號粉廠盤仍須四元五角半之現鈔、更有表示堅穩之態、統市成交續有四萬包左右、市面尙居檳局中、</p>
<p>小麥</p>
<p>小麥略形扣緊、近自洋麥定貨、絡繹到滬聲中、本麥所受打擊、巳屬不淺、如江北麥等僅售六元一二角、而廠方尙不接受、惟日商與華北銷塲尙稱蟬聯、市面已受重大影響、昨聞本麥喊價較高、良以米價在漲、人心欠安、糧食似有看好之望、惟廠客需要、均各淡薄、市面又呈擯局、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>本市與　莊間之航業、九一八後、已被獨佔、故行駛牛莊之洋商船亦已停班、祇有不定期之船行駛、昨日有某英商輪、裝儎麵粉一萬二千包、運往牛莊、聞該項麵粉、係某國商所報裝、在目前情形下、英輪裝得此貨、不知以何種緣中攬得、麵粉今日有一萬四千三百三—包運福州、</p>
<h3>金融　大戶觀望　金巿淸堅</h3>
<p>咋日現金烚赤暗盤市况、毫無走勢、結果微昇、價格則終日徘徊於二千一百二十八九之間、蓋各方人心、對於本市環境情形、各有懷疑忐忑不安之象、大戶遂均呈旁觀態度、以待局勢轉變、再作方針、加以英法兩租界戒備甚嚴、現金收解不便、是以點綴市面者、祇有少數軋頭寸交易而已、全天不滿三百兩之數、銀樓飾金亦未變更、海關金仍平、中英純金等稍見高昇、</p>
<p>烚赤僅軋漲二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初時塲內沉靜殊久、直至十時一刻方始開市、銀樓帮進錢兌業五十兩、價為二千一百三十元、較前收做高三元、俄銀樓帮售予錢兌業五十兩、價與晨開相同、此後又轉沉寂、惟賈方仍有供意、迨至十一時後、見錢兌　塞予金號五十兩價　丸元、趨勢平疲、後銀　帮互做五十兩、為廿八元、作午收價、午後因法租界戒備頗嚴、同時英租界亦起戒備、致現貨收解有感不便、故大戶均呈旁觀、成交愈淸、僅見錢兌業互做三十兩、價二十九元、市勢穩定、延至晚收價仍為二千一百二十九兀、結果比隔昨晚收　漲二元、全天僅二兀差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百三十五元、收進二千一百二十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均有行無市、</p>
<p>首飾金站定不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、均未更動、大同行仍懸二百十七元、新同行二百十五元、收進二百零九元、</p>
<p>英純金長半便土</p>
<p>十八日倫敦電　英純金突長半辦士、計每盎斯升達七鎊八先令六辦士、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦掛高至一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦隨漲四角、計一千二百零七元六角、</p>
<h3>港滙略緊　英美現平期鬆</h3>
<p>滙市昨洋行雖頻來扒吸現貨、無如外行供意頗濃、日西商沙遜亦一度拋塞、是以情勢仍穩定無變、而期貨因外銀行賣意愈殷、加以華行國華亦突來吐售、致雖有外行有利（代日行與津帮）吸購、然而頭寸仍感寬裕、於是為狀續呈穩中帶硬之象、交易尙旺、至港滙因外銀行賣胃不甚健旺、故狀况稍見緊軟、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均縮零六二五、紐的銀價呆定、倫教生金長半辦士、匯兌英對美·對滬·對法仍平、美對英·對滬·對法均半、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英滙八辦士二五、美匯十六元零六二五、較隔昨晚收、均無　動、開後洋行首先結進滙豐·華比現貨英金八辦士二五、繼而又扒吸荷蘭·華比現貨美匯十六元零六二五、因供求相應，故缺乏變化、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉不動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉小二厘半、計徵百分之五，二五、此後洋行又結進西商沙遜現貨英金為八辦士二五、時華行國華突塞予有利（代日行及津帮）本月份美滙為十六元零六二五、旋有利又購納華義七月份美匯為十五元八七五、後外銀行又塞予東方滙理銀行七月份英金為八辦士一五六二五、市勢穩中帶硬、將近午刻、英美兩滙、成交轉稀、僅有港滙買賣、計外行安達吸進華商投機家現貨價為五十五元三七五、後華行力吸進荷蘭現貨價祇五十五元二五為狀軟化、迨午收銀行現貨賣價、英美兩滙與晨開不相上下、港滙為五十五元二五、</p>
<p>後市洋行界繼續先向華比扒結現貨美滙十六元零六二五、繼叉結進荷蘭現貨英金八辦士二五、為狀仍鮮變幻、入後洋行再來吸收華比。麥加利本月份等滙十六元兀零三一二五、狀况亦平、而港滙則未聞成交、但銀行賣價仍為五十五元二五、延至晚收、銀行現貨　價英滙八辦十二五、羊滙十六元零六二五、結果比上日晚收英美兩滙現貨仍平、期貨依然穩中帶硬、港滙則軋緊一二五、</p>
<h3>外匯之　三大漏巵</h3>
<p>外滙止有此數也，雖加統制，但八辦士之滙價，仍可予取予求，故去統制甚遠，目前消費品中之漏巵最大者，洋麥，洋粉，洋花，更不幸而將來或有大宗洋米滙款，此外若滬上人士窮奢極欲之各種洋貨用品，其銷數反視戰前為甚，不信，可觀各店所陳列之商品，何况尙有更大之漏卮在，以可貴之外滙，如此作踐，可嘆！</p>
<h3>天津英美　匯價放長</h3>

<h3>日鮮鈔下跌</h3>
<p>昨日英純金漲半辦士、英美滙兌未動、本埠外滙、洋行結款甚殷、外銀行供給暢達、市價穩定乏變、烚赤開盤、金號買興　厚、市况堅挺、入後錢兌業供給稍暢、市價盤旋帶軟、下午供求勢均、交易稀少、全日動盪狹窄、外幣英美金鎊、殷富需要稍增而微升、英美金票因滙票遠期鬆、供給盛而微降、香港票因滙票潛勢軟弱、供給未暢、法郞票需要頗殷而升、日金票朝鮮票供給甚暢、需要稀少、下跌頗多、公會交易未做開、昨日市價、英金鎊升一角、英金票降一分、美金鎊升五分、美金票降三厘、香港票升三厘、法郞票升五毫、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>

<h3>紗花　手貨爭售　棉紗跌風加厲　雙馬天女再跌七元　籌碼頓呈供過於求</h3>
<p>紗市跌風允熾、蓋以環境欠佳、同時實需萎頌、人心愈形衰弱、一般存多鑒於如斯情形、將手貨爭先脫售為快、同業亦無意收進、市塲籌碼、益呈供過於求之勢、市價乃步趨下降矣、兩日來猛跌有十元之鉅、二十支雙馬直破四百二十兀關口、惟浙東方面輪運之恢復、但對於紗布是吾採辦、尙屬疑問、午後人頭到市集會者允稀、交易更冷靜、蓋以租界行道障礙網密佈、雙馬棧單價敲破四百十元關門、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、巿塲一片蕭索之象、空氣不良、交易殊滯、客帮亦束手、一般流動掮客在市呌喊變馬有生意吾、紗號派到當日門票現貨之戶、求售允切、因租界交通不便、竟將自己呌車駁運上棧、因之極願遷就賣脫、開價即跌二三元不等、雙馬門票現貨價為四百十九元、外棧現貨價四百二十元、棧單始做四百十四元半、後做十三元、少頃實銷僅廣帮萬興代香港帮購辦外、其他絕無動靜、賣風極盛、市價步開步下、某某等大戶視勢不佳、亦觀望不動、一霉間雙馬現貨跌至四百十七元、棧單價為四百十元、午後開出平常、成交一百餘包、皆係同行成交、雙馬現貨再跌一元、為四百十六元半、棧單價為四百零九元、查全日各帮買去統計九百二十五包、行情雙馬跌七元、天女亦跌七元、雙地球跌六元、十支特金城跌二元、今日有棉紗二百九十件運福州、又一百二十件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分別如左、</p>
<p>香港三三〇　雲南　三五</p>
<p>同行四九五　內地　六〇</p>
<p>溫州　三　統計九二三</p>
<p>日紗市面跌風大熾、且有一瀉直下之勢、實以現銷缺乏之故也、二十支月琴紗收盤價為三百五十一元、比上日跌十元之譜、</p>
<h3>北地紗花巿氣狂　與南方若出一轍</h3>
<p>北地花紗消息、久巳不為滬人士所聞矣、茲據友人帶來一些天津花紗狀况、雖云隔宿、在此種局面下亦屬可貴、</p>
<p>（一）天津棉花市塲、近來漲風甚熾、市價巳造成最高紀錄為華北棉花市塲有史以來之最高峯、細絨棉價由六十餘直張至七十七元、較諸去年之頂高價再加二元之巨、查其漲風劇烈之由來、不外乎來源短絀、紗價刺激、及偽鈔跌價也。</p>
<p>（二）查全市中各堆棧存棉、僅在八·九·萬包之譜、此項數字、不足供給津埠各紗廠三個月之需用、而今僅在舊曆三月中旬、棉區尙在播種之期、本年新花收成之豐、歉殊無從預測、縱然可期其豐稔、距離收成時期尙有半載之餘、照此情况論之、紗廠在靑黃不接之時、苟無原料可供給、勢必停止工作、於是紗廠方面為顧慮將來工作問題起見、不得在市先行購辦、待用作未雨綢繆之計、故各紗廠搜羅允殷、同時一般囤戶鑒於前途有利、紛起委託諸棉棧代行收買、售價雖增昂、亦所不惜、只求貨物到手、市塲流動之現貨、俱被吸收、底貨因而愈枯、市價乃猶如怒馬奔騰矣、</p>
<p>（三）津地棉花來源素以西河御河兩處為主、茲今兩河來源依然寥似晨星、御河運到之貨、殊感缺乏、皆被棉商爭先下鄉搜羅殆盡、到貨因之不旺矣、內地農民所存之貨、成本價格、因而提高允鉅、津市棉價漲力愈强、以上之原由、皆使棉市上升之故也、（A）</p>
<h3>外棉頻漲不已　廠商暫行停辦</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市殊為堅定、日來交易數額雖未見增、然市上現貨奇缺、政府之貸款棉尙無放出消息、新花將於八月登塲、値此靑黃不接之際若貸款棉於六七月中再不放出、則將造成驚佈現象、然政府現正準備、將於棉價再漲若干時、即將絡續放出、藉此亦可大量淸除倉庫、及充實國庫矣、昨日紐的漲九至十一磅音、印度四五月份白洛區已造成一七二之新高價、埃及平平、折合法幣、計美棉及巴西棉每擔漲八角、印棉漲四角、埃及不動、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來因海外棉市連漲、折合棉價高漲太巨、故中外廠商均暫時停辦、况述日外棉到貨甚多、各同業心思亦趨冷淡、如紐的回小三十磅昔、或印棉回跌十羅比、則外棉交易頓可恢復以前之繁榮、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價列下、</p>

<h3>證劵　局勢不甯　洋商股票仍堅挺　內債市况不無恍惚</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤昨日巿況、忽因本埠謠言而遭挫折、惟以事態未明、人心頓形恍惚多方頗有戒心、空方亦未敢遽爾加碼、市價萎靡尙可支持、惟以交易已稀波動更微、此種醞釀之局、決不能久常、今日尙有較大震盪也、昨日經過、開盤初則賣怕了較濃、天生同康聯和及恒字等號頗有多頭出籠、疲落三四角、後以潤利大通永豐等以及同德均有吸收、稍稍回高、比隔日微疲而已、午後情形穩定帶疲、交易甚淸、買賣雙方均極閑散、謠言雖多、無從證實、續見微小、此種局面、總覺事態未减嚴車性、人心不安、市價不易回上耳、結果略小五分一角至二角、成交總數共計五十餘萬元而已、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>華商股票無交易、洋商股票、據衆業公所報吿、因政局之轉佳、致股市亦形堅挺、惟交易仍似不廣、投資者繼續吸納電車股、成交卅九元、及公和祥股買價一百九十七元、瑞鎔股穩定、似無更動、價為七元八角五分、但耶松股稍疲、因該公司一九三九年之中期息、祇派四元、似有人以為太少、電話股經近日之暴漲、現今稍形平靜價為九十九兀、怡和股無甚上落、收盤買價十八元七角、公司債券趨勢軟弱、電力五厘半債券在八十八元之價、頗有供求、橡皮股潛勢堅昂、但買價與賣價相差太遠、成交數極微、</p>

<h3>疋頭　東疋慘跌未己　國布現銷淸淡</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨各路現銷、一致淸　淡、本街以人心浮動、兼以天氣將熱未熱、夏令貨尙未達盛銷時季、故鬥市交易、亦顯閒散、惟中西服裝帮批發交易、仍維持佳狀、各貨漲跌丸見、白貨售盤以永安申新等紡織廠出品大鵬。富貴細布最稱堅穩、夸帮及浙東溫紹帮指定牌子購去四五十包、而單純織廠出品細布斜紋受東疋猛跌影響、市價盤旋益下、染廠嫌貴不用、粵帮溫州帮辦五六十件、價跌每疋一角之譜粗布·粗斜囤貨急於出節市盤每疋續鬆五分至一角、本街與溫紹帮續購近百件、漂染布疋本街客帮進意懈怠、僅有散額成交、本埠染廠因而停工者已增至十餘家、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>白貨跌風未己、盤旋下游、昨龍頭細布一瀉三四角、做過十三元零五分至一角、後市同業抵補、冉冉上升、又至十三元四角、下月期貨十三元四角半至五角、人心始略趨穩定、但色貨嗶嘰直貢連續在跌、同業允其驚惶、如四君子嗶嘰昨日低盤每碼降至叫角一分半、與最高峯時四角九分半、慘落每碼八分之鉅、以每疋計差跌二元四角、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>疋頭二十日出口、六十五件運天津、三十五件運烟台、二十五件運幅州、臨平繭市已開秤運輸費用頗繁重</p>
<h3>絲茶　外絲轉下游　滬絲無起色　臨平繭巿已開秤　運輸費用頗繁重</h3>

<p>據杭州方面傳來消息、臨平一帶、繭市已於前日　秤、然因年成欠佳、困難又多、故土種鮮繭已由四十元漲至六十元、洋種鮮繭則自六十洋漲至八十洋（均以擔為單位）、收繭方法、自難公開、但據事實推測、佔領區域、似較不便、游擊區域、則大都可設行收繭、唯來去運輸、尙須有人為之週旋、大槪由內地運赴上海、每擔鮮繭包運費用、每擔為四十元、包括數種不知名目之「捐稅」及水脚佣金、刻長江附近、蘇州無錫等鄕、亦即將　秤、「華中公司」僅能在無錫城廂區、及西鄕兩區、從事收繭蘇州亦然、此外區域、均由游擊隊保護、而未受壓迫繭訊方面、滬杭綫比較惡劣、且因前年該處無法收繭、故今春育蠶量大見减少、據云一般情形、僅有一二分年成、京滬錢則影響較少、然亦僅及前年半數餘云、</p>
<h3>油餅　生豆油再上騰</h3>
<p>昨日生豆油巿况、承上日之良好影象、塲面上萬數籌碼、已遂漸轉運、新剩餘額半數、已由多頭公司占囤、故近兩日辦胃稍呈活潑、籌碼頓感緊縮、市價續見盤升、已做開膠州生油一百件、價為三十元、比上日漲一元、大連桶生油須漲一元半、計開四十元、成交四十桶、豆油成妥烟歧油三百五十件、靑歧油五十件、連歧大簍五十件、膠州油二百件、大連桶油三百桶、及豐年油三十桶、行情均較前漲五角至一元云、</p>

<h3>海味　烟台干貝　新貨在途</h3>
<p>烟台干貝、因行家陳貨、早經銷罄、致市勢沉寂、茲屆出新期間、巳據產區來訊、首水貨裝運在途、不日即將到滬、</p>
<h3>五金　新鉛絲行盤亦軟</h3>
<p>五金交易、近日來因各路客商納胃呆滯、兼之國際及滬上形勢日趨緊張、本街廠家方面、對於五金品之需辦、亦已不及前數週之旺、是故各色五金售槃均稍稍見軟、如白鉛皮本廠釘路皮鐵平白鐵黃鋼絲三角鐵黑鐵皮等均較前市軟弱、故新鉛絲市况當然也不能例外、昨開出僅數百捆而已、標準行情如十六號至二十號售三十五元、二十一號至二十五號售四十五元、二十五號單吊花色開六十五元、比前之黃金時代、已跌落達五元至十元之鉅、</p>
<h3>煤炭　印煤隨到隨銷</h3>
<p>印度烟煤、日來雖絡繹有到、但本市缺貨已久、一有來貨、無不紛粉在辦、大有隨到隨銷之勢、昨某號到貨七千餘噸、同行拆去已過半數、計開棧單自出、印度統煤每噸三十九元二角五分、篩塊四十一元、下身屑子四十元、船上過駁、便宜五角、門莊客戶送到、加四元行情、</p>

<h3>乘輪船時　携帶行李問題</h3>
<p>— 景</p>
<p>凡是出門旅行的人，無論是以經商或以游歷為目的，對於個人方面的行李，當然是有携帶的必要，其携帶行李數量的多少，亦隨各人的心願而定，所以一般旅行的工具，如飛機，汽車，火車以及輪船等等，因為要避免乘客多帶行李起見，對於携帶行李都有一種規定的限制。這問題亦是相當的複雜，現在所報吿給各位讀者的，是一些乘船時的行李問題</p>
<p>無論那一個掄船公司，對於旅客隨身携帶的行李，其規定的辦法，是依照艙位及等級的高低以及路程的遠近，限定一個免費載運行李的標準。這種限額，各輪船公司並不一律，若是旅客所携帶行李的數量，超過這規定限額的時候，輪船方面就要依照定章來向旅客收取逾量行李運費，收費是很高的。關於上述情形，一般人固巳普遍明瞭，但是一般對於旅行經騐缺乏的人，假使在乘船前，偶一疏忽而携帶巨量行裝，甚至於將家用的傢具以及各項不十分需要的東西，都携帶上輪，孰知在船上所應該繳的逾額行李運費，其數目之大，有時竟較所携帶的物件（如舊鐵床網籃以及各笨重傢具等等）的原値會超過很多。到了這時候，假使依照了輪船公司的章程而納費，則覺得為數浩大，臨時捨棄之，又是不可能的事，那時候弄得進退兩難，處置是很費周章的。</p>
<p>各輪船公司對於免費行李及逾量行李的辦法，現在單就上海至香港一段而言，行駛的公司較多，同時任何國籍的輪船都有，所以關於上述的辦法，亦各有不同。大概的說：美國總統輪船公司及昌興公司，對於每個頭等搭客的免費行李是四十立方尺或三百五十磅，二三等每人可帶二三十立方尺或一百七十五磅，至二百五十磅不等。逾這限額每立方尺取費美金一角五分，每磅一分半，凡是行李質量量的，則以磅為單位，體積大的則以立方尺為單位。其他如英，法，意，德，荷各國輪船公司，與上述者亦大同小異，其取費之昂，由此就可見一般。</p>
<p>所以凡是要出門旅行而擬多帶行李的話，最好在未出發前，向輪船公司或旅行機關，打聽淸楚，藉此可以有一個預算，免得臨時發生週折。還有各船公司對於旅客所帶的衣箱，皮夾，舖蓋，或旅行必須物品等，均視為行李外，凡是各項大件如新像具，鋼琴，冰箱，或經以篾片或木板打包而不能啟視的物件，都視為貨物。携帶這些東西時，應當正式報關裝運，或者先向海關請領Permit　to　Sbip然後送船。其他如携帶貓犬烏類（Pets），也要照章納費，而且收費很高還。有一些應當注意的，是行李票簽，各船公司對於行李票簽大都分為隨身携帶（Wanted）與落艙（Not　Wantde）兩種：凡是在旅途上所需要的小件行李，可以將（Wanted）的行李票貼上，以便置在房內，隨時取用。其他比較笨重而不十分需要的行李，可貼後一種，放置在行李艙內。輪船當局為謀旅客便利起見，每日有一規定的時閒，將行李艙開放，由旅客去啟視或取東西。所以凡是一般不十分需要的行李，儘可置在行李艙內，藉此可以使　室寬暢一些那又保樂不為呢！</p>
<h3>最新出品八匹馬力　奧斯汀之樣車</h3>
<p>英國奧斯汀汽車廠，為適合全球各處需要起見，最近新出一種八匹馬力奧斯汀，其大小儼如十匹馬力奧斯汀，但定價則比較便宜不少。同時汽油亦可節省許多，蓋兼有十匹馬力奧斯汀之舒適，及七匹馬力奧斯汀之經濟者也。頃聞本埠邁爾西愛路一百號糾喴汽車公司已　到此項八匹馬力奧斯汀六扇窗四門轎車樣車一輛，大批尙在途中，又聞原有七匹馬力小奧斯汀廠方巳決定停止製造。</p>
<h3>小蘭腦汽車　存貨即將售罄</h3>
<p>霞飛路四二四號法大汽車公司，最近所到一批一九三九年式蘭腦小型汽車，因式樣玲瓏，汽油經濟，深受汽車界歡迎，銷路甚佳。頃己所餘無幾，聞下批新車，不久亦可抵申。惟定價因成本關係，將略增加；至於現存之貨，仍照原定價格出售，以示優待。</p>

<h3>關於滬西公社</h3>
<p>— 膠人</p>
<p>—一點補充和校正—</p>
<p>讀了本刋十七日西蒙君的「滬西公社」一文，覺其內容尚欠真實，似有補充之處，　就筆者所見，供實本刋，以見其槪况之一般。</p>
<p>自八·一三戰事起後，滬西公社曾因故被封閉者，歷二閱月，後經數度交涉，始於去年十一月間恢復工作。里面的設務，亦因格於環境而較戰前改縮：操塲上的小足球架，籃球架也拆除了，運動塲上除了給小孩子們玩的滑梯外，其他竟找不出一種運動設備和器械來。至於閱報室，現在亦已沒有了，祇留一二份備社中職員閱讀，那大槪是為了避免發生「意外」的緣故吧！</p>
<p>在這種困難下，滬西公社的工作槪况，約可分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）職工子弟小學——那是全為了那些日夜在工廠工作的勞工們，可以使他們（和她們）的子弟有受教育的機會而設立的。學費低廉，至高不過三元。</p>
<p>（二）苦兒班——在下午二點鐘起是苦見班上課的時間。教師並不是那些什麼師範畢業的先生們，就是從職工子弟學校里所挑選出品學兼優的學生來充任，他們是實行陶行知先生所倡導的「小先生制」，成績堪稱優良。苦兒班學費全免，書籍亦由社中供給</p>
<p>（三）職工補習夜校——分英文班，國算班兩種，上課時間在晚上七點至九點，學生全屬工廠工人或商店學徒。利用業餘時間，匯進其學識，使其能有「半工半讀」的機會，收費亦廉。</p>
<p>（四）貧民診所——每天下午二時至五時，由中華醫學會指派醫生護士來社診查貧民疾病，每次祇收號金三分，醫藥費均免收。</p>
<p>（五）圖書館——暫限學生借閱，在計劃擴大中。</p>
<p>（六）遊戲室——大禮堂內設乒乓檯兩只為遊戲室，滬西工友得隨時入內玩球休憇。操塲雖無球架，然尚可踢球，故來社運動者，日有百餘人。</p>
<p>（七）主日學校——每星期日上午，有教學教士來社，舉行主日學校，全體學生均得參加。</p>
<p>（八）大衆浴室——每屈盛暑，浴室開放，人人均可入浴，每次酌收費用二三分。</p>
<p>（九）民衆食堂——待辦中之民衆食堂，將純以低廉價格，簡單衛生菜肴，解決滬西勞苦民衆之民生問題，而藉以取締街頭各種不合衛生之食攤。</p>
<p>（十）其他——如為平民種痘，注射防疫針等，槪不取費。</p>
<p>滬西公社在滬西惡劣的環境中，能不斷地掙扎，苦幹，不憚辛勞地舉辦上述各種民衆事業，這是很使我們值得欽佩的。主持者的毅力，社員的精神，其造福於滬西勞働界者，更不勝枚舉了。</p>
<h3>風起雲湧中　海上銀號透視</h3>
<p>— （不敏）</p>
<p>—黃雨齊先生的談話—</p>
<p>十七日，本報載有一篇李秋梧關係銀號的文字，記者為好奇與求知的衝動，請教於黃雨齊先生，他是本埠銀號的第一個創辦者，也是資金最雄厚，規模最宏大的銀號—滙中—的主持人。接着又經黃先生的介紹，分訪幾位有該業中著有聲望的人物，承他們都開誠布公地告訴了我一個澈底，使我獲到了一個新的認識。</p>
<p>據黃先生說：「銀號這一個名詞，發現在銀行之前，從前是官立的，現在是商營的，所以組織和經營方法也是今昔不同了。我國經濟落後，大多數的社會層，却全是些李君所說的「拮据商人」，他們沒有機會享銀行與錢莊的福利。於是銀號應運而生，他是為普級工商服務的金融組織，他目前的發展狀態，正證明了是社會上一種急切的需要。」</p>
<p>「至於在銀號開戶無須介紹」，黃先生接着說：「這是為貫澈服務普級社會主旨的必要措置。可是這也並不是銀號的特創，有幾家擁有數百萬資本的銀行，他們的新戶也是無須介紹的。我認為祇要他確是正當的行商，就應當有開戶入來的權利，至於手續費票貼簿摺費等，原是銀錢業普通的規矩，也是銀錢業損益科目中應有的收益。</p>
<p>至於退票費的問題，「每一張退票要徵收三角退票費，似乎不合乎服務中小工商的原旨吧！」記者問。</p>
<p>「退票費的是否應當徵收，確是銀錢業實務上一個值得討論的問題。就埋論上講，就票據法上看，支票重資金關係，要本就不應當有退票。不過，在事實上，因為我國一般商人對票據認識的不足，退票又是避免不了的事。銀錢業為盡量减少退票起見，不得已才想出一個補救的辦法來。有的徵取五角，有的徵收三角，這原是一種應付實務的消極的對策，而決不是一個目的。講到某銀號每天有三百張的退票，這就是笑話了，我們姑不論這個數字的毫無根據，就是在事實上，也決不會有這種現象的。」</p>
<p>「那麼，我還聽說十三元幾角存了兩年，連一個錢都沒有了，這事有嗎，」記者又問</p>
<p>「你相信有這事嗎？」黃先生很鄭重地回答，「如果這個消息不幸是事實，那豈非是破天下的大荒！但是一經理智略一推考，就由不得我啞然失笑，據我的推想，大約是客戶憑摺解入銀款，憑支票支付，摺子上所記載的數目，原是單面收入的碼子，也許就在這上面弄錯了。」</p>
<p>記者表示滿意和感謝以後，臨別時黃行狂熱烈地說：</p>
<p>「總之，銀號業在我國，正在方興未艾的當兒，各界誠意的批評和指正，正是我們所竭誠歡迎而願意接受的。」</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　椎髻青裙賢良有母　銀髯翠袖矍鑠是翁</p>
<p>吃過午飯以後，朱村長陪着何家兩位小姐，以及朱愛人愛羣，坐了愛人的汽車，他們五個人，來相地址。離自由村不遠，就有一條運河，河面也還寬闊，往來船隻很多。那邊就有好幾塊地，都是屬於村有的，而且沿河就是公路，正是水陸交通的好地方。對岸是青山隱隱，綠樹依依，好似有幾簇漁村農舍人家。據朱村長說：『運河的這一邊，屬於自由村，運河的那一邊，不屬於自由村了。」何雙玉問道：『那邊是什麼地方？』朱村長道：「那邊喚作水竹村，村長姓徐，我也認得，這人的年紀，今年八十多歲了。何麗玉心中暗想：怎麼這裏的所謂村長之類，都是老頭子。只是心中想着，却未曾說出口來。朱村長又接着說道：『這位老徐村長，倒也很　為了他，他真是個毀家紓難的人。他雖是個水竹村人，但他不是一個農民，從年輕時就出外經商，也不住在本村。到了中年時，他的商業發達，手裏很有幾十萬家私。後來在上海　投機事業，也賺了不少的錢，立刻成了一位富翁。但他沒有兒子，連女兒也沒有一個。其實沒有兒女，有什麼關係，但中國人向以嗣續為重，膝下空虛，便是人生一個大缺憾。當時有許多朋友，勸他螟蛉一個兒子，或是過房一個女兒。人家知道他家產頗富，也願意把兒女過繼與他，將來可以承受他的遺產。但是這個老頭子很倔強，不要人家的兒女。他也窺測到人家要把兒女過繼給他，無非凱　他的這點兒財產。所以不是他自己的兒女。他情願不要，寗可做一個孤老頭子。這時他的原配夫人，早已死了，討了兩個續　，這兩個續　，也已死了。人家勸他納妾，他說年紀已老了，也不再去害人家女兒　青春了。其實那時很有人願意嫁這老頭子的，也是想他的那份財產，知道是不久人世的了。待他一死，可以安然享受，或可以另嫁別人。那徐老頭子偏不願意，及至中國戰爭的時候，徐老頭子也七十多歲了。他們所有產業，除了一部份，在淪陷區中，一時未能收回，此外他都捐輸給國家。他想得很透澈，他想：與其將來落於不知誰何之手，不如報效了國家。（一一四）</p>
<h3>三劍客</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“The　3　Muskelesrs”</p>
<p>二十世紀福斯出品　大光明映</p>
<p>揭開法國皇室與紅衣主教政權鬥爭的名著，大仲馬的「三劍客」是不能使我們忘記的，少年劍客達達安的勇敢，紅衣教主的陰險，三劍客效忠法皇的忠烈，在大仲馬筆調底下，為我們勾劃出英雄，美人的風姿。</p>
<p>反映在電影上的，我們看見過無聲片時代范朋克主演的「三劍俠」與「續三劍俠」，至有聲片時代，有聲的「三劍俠」繼之而起，在劍光鏗鏘聲中，達達安與宮女康斯登絲的幽會；皇后赴跳舞會時，別針尚未送到，皇后的焦灼；教主在法王面前，看到皇后胸前的別針大驚失色；這些，都是富有戲劇性的素材，不怪好萊塢抓住不肯放手，一再攝製「三劍客」了。</p>
<p>這部「三劍客」因為要使要滋三兄弟儘量製造笑料，因之和原著略有改動。如從前達達安到倫敦去把別針在法國公爵那裏拿回來，路上遭遇着許多危險，而現在祇使達達安在貴婦迪溫特手裏，把她由公爵那裏偷來的別針搶過來，許多危險的塲面，都在這裏省去了。</p>
<p>以改動的部份說，雖然沒有過去「三劍俠」那麼緊張，但它的喜劇氣氛，確也相當可愛的</p>
<p>在詼諧漫畫下，披上了「三劍客」大帽佩劍的李滋三兄弟，因為通過了像「三劍客」這樣富有戲劇性的故事，他們因為有戲可做，比從前一味胡鬧，楞着眼睛裝着怪腔的作品，似乎高明得多。</p>
<p>在演出效果上，整個影片，也是相當激動滑稽的，它較好的塲面，有如下數塲：</p>
<p>（一）達達安冒充了主教，帶着宮女康斯登絲駕着六匹馬車向巴黎進發，—這一塲戲，氣氛，鏡頭的運用，都很卓越：那六匹馬在鄉村公路上疾馳的姿勢，在仰角鏡頭下，馬蹄騰突而過，教主衛隊馬隊越空而來，車夫離開駕駛的座椅，達達安由後面車廂裏，爬到前面座椅上，又撲到前面馬背身上，抓回那繮繩……。前後對照的手法，使這塲戲達到了預期的高潮。</p>
<p>（二）皇后赴舞會之前，還沒有拿到那鑽石的別針，但是當她和法王向別個貴婦們變腰行禮的時候，由幕帷背後伸出一隻手來，那是一隻晶亮的鑽石別針，（「特寫」：皇后拿了這隻別針）皇后鎮定地站在教主面前。……慢慢拿開羽毛扇，胸口露出那隻使教主大驚失色的別針……。</p>
<p>唐亞曼契飾達達安。他唱歌比劍，雖够英武，但也算對付的了；李滋三兄弟那塲銅鼓舞，渾身上下都是銅鈸，三人起舞的時候，確得使觀衆大笑失聲的。</p>
<p>但全劇有一個不能彌缺憾，就是真的「三劍客」出塲，被灌醉以後，就從此不見，一直由李滋三兄弟胡鬧下去，這是無法挽回的大漏洞。</p>
<p>飾主教的，不够陰險沈着，李昂愛脫華戲太少，無法一展所長。</p>
<p>李滋三兄弟，十分胡鬧的塲面，减少了穿插的比較合理的滑稽塲面，如騎馬後伸不直腰，扮教公子和衛隊打岔，使達達安越入皇宮，都比過去一味瞎吵的硬滑稽順眼得多。</p>

<h3>談談元元旦與蓋呌天</h3>
<p>— 張古愚</p>
<p>元元旦為富連成頭科弟子。初名高喜玉。花旦，刀馬，武旦兼工、扮相雖不能稱美。然腰腿功夫之佬。寸子之穩、足稱一時無雙。民二會來滬上。聲譽殊假、明年秋北返、應俞振亭之約、搭雙慶社。出演於文明園、戲碼常列大軸。配角皆為師兄弟，如鐘喜久，侯喜瑞，陳喜德，郭喜芳，郭喜慶。而戲單上還加印「由上海新回眞正」字樣。共盛況可知。</p>
<p>蓋呌天。河北高陽人。原名張英傑。藝宗李春來。穩練端凝且過之。早年靠子戲極佳「伐子都」一劇，會稱雄於一時。中年以後轉帖短打戲。焦慶利，李德山，譚永奎，祁彩芬等。皆為蓋之良配。民初聲勢最聲。民四冬北返省親。途經北个，為俞振亭所留，出演於吉祥。第一日劇目為「四杰村」。碼子列梅蘭芳王鳳卿之「汾河灣」後。（此時梅氏正紅）俞振亭朱桂芳之「攻潼關」居倒第四，居然五一起棚者。實為南嶺最光榮的一頁史。現在呢，元元旦不能在半津立足，後倒於哈爾濱。蓋老五（呌天）在更新登台。非雙跔即難上座。回撩當年。眞有「往事不堪回首」之感。</p>
<h3>上海銀行京劇社　綵排觀光記</h3>
<p>— 老羊</p>
<p>上海銀行同仁京劇社於行第三日下午七時。舉行第三次綵排。記者叨列末座。幸飽耳福。戲散歸來。時已午夜。摩挲倦眼。沘筆略記梗概。羊毛之言。不足當大雅之一顧也。記者到場少晚，提放已成尾盤。即聽他言慢西皮一段。亦僅聆其半。</p>
<p>第二齣字宙峰　飾趙女者為未梅雨君·扮相清秀·態度端莊·適合閨秀身份·行腔流利·新輪老手·自是不凡·惟嗓音略澀，以覺吃力·不知是否因瑓於吊嗓關係·朱君面龐·上豐下削。片子在近眾骨部份·以可略貼向外。所涂口脂·亦略嫌稍淡·如照管見修改。在對鏡扮妝時。或無甚願明區別·而自台下遠望。必須能增加美的成份不少也。此據本為青衣重頭戲。即內行亦不輕動·而朱君演出·平正穩貼。不溫不火。實屬不易、臥魚身段。尤見功夫。</p>
<p>第三齣汾河灣　吳宏猷君與吳澹如女士以眞伉儷分飾假夫妻。鬧窰一場。更覺逼眞。想吳君於下跪賠禮時。或已忘卻為戲中人耶。一笑。聞吳夫人乃初次登五台。而唱作通體平穩無疵。雖能可貴。嗓音寬而甜潤。再加以琢磨·未可限量。有聞吳君雖會經登台數次。但所飾丑角。唱老生亦係初次·扮相雄偉挺拔。想見半遼王常年氣概。吳君由此應決定棄丑習生矣·此戲做多於唱。票友視為畏途·吳君伉儀。合作純熟·均不類破題見兒第一遭者·非具天才·不克溱此。具體言之。吳君念作優於唱工。吳夫人則唱作優於念白·一得之愚。或可為吳君實伉儷切磋之一助耶。蘇夏軒軍與蘇石秋女士夫婦。分飾老租與薛丁山。石秋女士十嗓音寬亮。行腔頗有餘味。牛刀小試。未足展共所長也。薛平貴二次出場。唱適離了汾河灣……一段流水時。場面為起搖板。至首二句與唱腔未能吻合。至第三句方始合拍。不知何故。記者對於此據無登台經驗。未敢自以為是。惟記於此。就正於是日列席諸君焉。</p>
<p>第四齣奠鶴楊　趙仲光君飾劉備。陳寶德軍飾趙雲。朱協卿飾周瑜。配搭發齊·火鐵異常。二君異常賣力。唱作兼優。劉皇叔之忽喜忽懼。表情深刻。周都督之一腔心事。藉端發揮。周將軍之精力彈滿。一身是膽。均表現淋漓儘管。方之內行亦不多讓。惟朱君與陳君嗓音。相差有一個調門。折中定玹。兩君似均覺不無吃力耳。記者因有他事。未候終場·即辭出往。故大軸樊江關未能寓月。殊為恨事。上行回人招待殷勤。歸游藝餘事。亦絲毫不茍。見見辦專精神。良可敬佩也。</p>

<p>打魚殺家裏飾公役的那個丑角，頭場上念「離了家下」有的加上一句，「還是那句話，」大都能逗台（廿三）　下一樂。做做舞稿，也是一樣，做來做去，也不過寫著那套，「舞客」「舞女」和舞場。自己寫得膩透了。居然還會有人悄書帶信來讚譽我。說什麽含有哲學思想，有益社會人心，還有人約我吃飯。眞使我一方面感激不盡，一方面情汗無地。這期的稿子，覺得有些寫不出來，也罷，上期寫的舞踪，這回就不再來一個罷，好比說「離了河下，來到家下，」雖然是丑角念的，到底也湊個趣。</p>
<p>我因為每期到星期五寫稿，總是忽忙迫促，所以自上期發稿以後，就決定星期日必定要把題目寫在稿簿上，以後那時間，那時寫，既安靜，又舒泰。這期的題目寫定了，我又想到一個添補資料辦法，原來往常我逛舞場，總是處於被動地位，隨著朋友們的意思轉移的，，主動性了，怎樣呢？就是逛不逛到隨便，要是逛的話，本期內逛過的所在，要等下期，方可出逛，否則，怨不奉陪，這樣一來，稿科固可加多，似乎是感覺著一種新趣味呢。下列之舞場，係按遊踪所至之先後為次：</p>
<p>偉宮—在上海銀行對面，鄧說摩飯店隔壁，廣告上戴著到桃花塢去的字樣，朋友約我去午飯，倒著寶深中下懷，入門的樓梯上就做著個假山洞，燈樓三步一花，五步一柳，掩映在黯淡的燈光下，倒確實有些眞假難辨，還有幾處茅舍，裹面會發出咿咿啞啞之聲，你道這聲，從何而來，恕我暫不宣備，諸位自己去瞧罷。</p>
<p>新華—大概情形，已在第四期寫過，現在除舞女陳蓉略有變更外，餘無改動，這次我們搜了伴侶去的，所以祗和林亞梅舞了一次，亞梅的臉，不能算美，然頗有雅氣，近時消瘦了些，更顯著清瘦模樣，若在男子們講起來，就是帶三分書卷氣，我說她瘦了，她定要說胖了，祗是臉上顯示的微笑；總帶些勉強色彩，據說近來又看見她了，莫非有什麽難言之隱吧。</p>
<p>逍遙—眞奇怪，有一天晚上一位朋友邀著我，竟帶著三位高級舞場的紅星，光降到逍遙去，起先說到逍遙，我灣不知道在什麽地方，到達時繩曉得就是昔時的皇后劇場，戲台改作音樂台，似乎嫌大些，舞池似乎太長，地板倒還光滑，座位人色，當然不能與高級舞場相提並論，舞女却也不少，我是走馬觀花，大約十步之內，未必沒有芳草吧。</p>
<p>安樂宮—名ABC在愛多亞路東段，去年余光顧甚頗，許久未去，一仍舊觀，午飧音樂似嫌活燥，我的朋友，本是循舒蘊蘭之幾場，收了阿珍阿珠二名徒弟，係屬杭產之花，寫幾個字，都還不錯，據說皆有小學畢業程度咧。</p>
<p>仙樂—走了幾天小舞場，再到大舞場來，自然感覺到富麗華貴，可是那天晚上我和幾位朋友，明天都有事要早起，寬會枯坐片時，索然而返，可見心理的力量，畢竟比環境的力量大，佛說一切唯心造，儒謂知足常樂，不知足的心理，能使人是存著個知足常樂的觀念，即使老坐在家中，也許比常到舞場還快活呢。</p>
<p>此外我到過大華，大都會各一次，篇幅已長，不欲多寫，在大華遇著一位舞星，也呌胡瑛，亦頗姣好，據說那常州胡瑛，祗做夜舞了，然而那常州人，究竟呌不呌胡瑛呢？還是祗能說在兩可之間，祗好自己罵一聲，糊塗得很。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>義伶羅葵肪生前有兩事足述</p>
<p>第一椿事是當他在北平方露頭角的時候，那時正值遜清未棄，私坊還沒有取消，小寶亦生不逢長，既吃這碗戲飯，當然也不能打破這種壞環境，只好隨著一班師弟兄時常出來侑觴。他那時不過二十上下的年紀。生得眉目清秀，皮膚白皙，梳一條大辮子，留起長劉海。穿件十三太保的馬甲，的確是個美男子。當時却大為某將軍所垂青，不時招他出來侑酒，逢他有戲的日子。某將軍一定就是幾排座或是幾個包廂，著富在他身上花的錢不在少數。這事在小寶的一班師弟兄看來，都覺得非常榮幸，無不瞧著眼熟，但是小寶自己方面，不但不承他的情，並日還深恨某將軍的糾纏不清，好像是故意來侮辱自己，不過彼時有嚴師在旁，雖是心中忿恨，要亦無如之何罷了。後來他忽然感覺到這種非人的生活，若不早早擺脫，將來是永無抬頭之日的。他既拿定主見之後，一面仍同某將軍虛與委蛇，一面就私自向老生行裹瓉研，有時老譚唱「空城計」，小寶就央求他師傅對後台管事說，請派他個琴童的角兒，（彼時老譚正與瑤卿同班）所以後來他唱「空城」最負盛名，就是因為當了好幾次的左右琴童之一，對於老譚的腔調聽得千真萬確的緣故。其將軍一點沒瞧出他的私心來，依舊還棒架不遺餘力，誰想他剛一　師，馬上就拜在某老闆門下，專習鬆生，並日向他道位新拜的老師約法三章，第一條就是從此不出外侑酒，以免妨礙學業。他這種種所為，事先既未向某將軍接連招他幾回，他都护絕不往。某將軍者人找他，幾次三番他也不給面見，某將軍一氣，簡直要瘋，從此兩人就斷絕往來。後來某將軍拼命的花錢，組織團體，極力要把某名旦棒紅，據說就是受了小寶的激刺，失望之餘，繩藉著這事來洩憤呢。（十六）</p>
<h3>璇宮今夜彩排</h3>
<p>— 路</p>
<p>今天又是禮拜六之夜，璇宮除照例舉行「平劇會串」　之外，外加來一次彩排，在音樂裹上加建舞臺，在樂師的座前加掛彩景，這眞是開舞場未有的記錄，給舞客們不少的興趣，而且一直刺激到天亮，據個　頭表示，他可以擔保客人不打一個呵欠。據查今夜彩排的劇目，一共是三齣，一齣是未場舞星樊佩蘭的「起解」和張月桃素秋的「新紡棉花」，之後一齣是別處不易見到的七齣靈通小學轉蘭的「遊龍戲鳳」，小小年紀演出那娘兒們的佩服的事情，這是眾多的夠味。最後　　，璇宮的花園舞場　　　　，妒忌工，獲裹順後的報告一下。</p>

<h3>America Adopts a Strong Stance in the Far East, Highly Praised by All Sides; US Troops Receive Orders to Use Force if Necessary to Protect Nationals; British Ambassador Craig Visits Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Expressing Agreement with the US Stance; Japanese Spokesperson Still Claims Their Established Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(New York) The firm stance taken by Britain, France, and the United States in handling the Kulangsu (Gulangyu) incident has been met with satisfaction from various agricultural newspapers here, all of whom regard this action as an unprecedented move to curb Japan's ambitions to expel Western nations from China. The Democratic Party's New York Times stated, "Wherever Japan's influence extends, foreign interests are severely eroded, and what remains is only a portion adapted to Japan's plans. Although this has been repeatedly denied by that country, it is undeniable when considering the facts. However, the amount of Japanese goods exported to Britain, France, and the United States accounts for one-quarter to one-third of its total exports. Therefore, how can Japan lightly disregard the interests of these countries?" The Republican Party's New York Herald Tribune stated, "The actions taken by Western nations in Kulangsu and the US State Department's note regarding the Shanghai International Settlement are both considered satisfactory. Japan's brazen demand to control these international settlements rightly evokes strong resentment." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Kulangsu incident was recently commented on by The Times, saying, "Such incidents seem clumsy and will not be the second to occur, nor will they be the last. Since the Sino-Japanese War, the relationship between Japanese soldiers and foreign settlements in China has been like that between a small dog and a hedgehog. The small dog barks incessantly, while the hedgehog seems wary and restrains its activities. However, the small dog resumes its activity from time to time, making tentative attacks. The settlements in Tianjin and Shanghai have already been eroded, and in the past week, there was the incident in Kulangsu. Their intention is clear, but they have not yet succeeded, simply because of their nature, and it is not necessary to expect them to cease their activities abruptly." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Far East is now showing us an example of how to deal with dictators: treat them firmly. The position of Kulangsu is similar to that of the Shanghai International Settlement. If democratic countries concede in Kulangsu, it will be difficult to gain a foothold in Shanghai in the future. The landing of Japanese marines in Kulangsu was a probing act, but after the British, American, and French authorities displayed admirable firmness, Japan began to withdraw its troops. The Birmingham Post stated that since the Sino-Japanese War, the best action taken by democratic countries in the Far East to protect their own interests has been the handling of the Xiamen (Amoy) incident. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) On May 3rd, the Japanese government sent a note to the British and American governments, explaining the Japanese government's views on maintaining the Shanghai International Settlement. The US government expressed its inability to agree on the 17th. Now, the British government has also taken the same step as the US government. At 11:00 AM on the 19th, British Ambassador Craig visited Vice Minister Sawada to clarify that his views were the same as those of the US government. However, the Japanese government believes that the reform of the International Settlement's institutions is a necessary condition for building a "New Order in East Asia," so it will continue to advance according to its established policy. (19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was revealed by the State Department today that US forces in the Far East have received orders to use force if necessary to protect Americans residing in the Kulangsu International Settlement. Currently, the US light cruiser "Marblehead" and destroyer "Rathburne" are docked in Xiamen. At the same time, 42 US soldiers under the command of officers landed in Kulangsu yesterday. Britain and France have also landed with similar military strength. The strength of the foreign troops currently landed is equal to the number of Japanese troops still stationed in Kulangsu who have not yet withdrawn. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared today that the Japanese marines who landed in Kulangsu did not disturb any foreigners in the International Settlement, and the news reported by foreign newspapers is not true. The spokesperson expressed regret for the joint action of Britain, the United States, and France in concentrating warships and sending sailors to land in Kulangsu, because the reason for this action by Britain, the United States, and France was that the Japanese landing forces had searched foreigners. In fact, the Japanese side did not search foreigners, nor did it disturb any foreign residents. The spokesperson also stated that last year, Japanese marines patrolled Kulangsu for two months, and no country raised any objections or protests, nor did foreign warships send sailors to land. The spokesperson continued, the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops landing in Kulangsu will depend entirely on the development of the future situation and will not be withdrawn due to protests from any country. The Japanese forces that landed have now been reduced to the minimum, and most have been withdrawn due to the easing of the situation. The spokesperson concluded that this withdrawal was entirely voluntary and solemnly stated that the landing of Japanese marines was entirely an emergency measure to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents and the safety of the commander of the South China Fleet, as it occurred on the day that Hong Lixun (transliteration), the chairman of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, was assassinated. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry expressed his opinion today, believing that no country can change Japan's established policy on the issue of public settlements and foreign concessions in China. However, the Japanese government will continue to maintain friendly negotiations with relevant foreign countries to seek a solution to this issue. In response to a question about the US government's rejection of Japan's request to expand its power in the Shanghai International Settlement's Municipal Council, the spokesperson said that the Japanese government did not request countries to respond to its memorandum on the Shanghai International Settlement policy, and also said that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai are currently conducting negotiations with the Municipal Council on reorganizing the Municipal Council and maintaining peace and order in the International Settlement. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese officials today strongly supported the attitude taken by the United States, Britain, and France towards the Japanese military occupation of Kulangsu, calling it a "determining factor" in protecting the interests of third countries in China and their rights in the International Settlement. A financial magnate told the Associated Press that force is the only way to deal with it. This action by third countries indicates that they can no longer tolerate Japan's encroachment on the International Settlement. This move has undoubtedly prevented the same incident from occurring in the Shanghai and Tianjin settlements. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Anti-British Movement</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, Japan has often conducted its two-pronged diplomacy towards Britain, the country with the greatest interest in the Far East, sometimes enticing, sometimes threatening, and sometimes using both tactics simultaneously, in a constantly shifting and unpredictable manner, seemingly containing countless contradictions. However, rather than calling this a contradiction, it would be more accurate to say that it is two edges of the same sword of Japan; although the dynamics are opposite, the effect is the same. The purpose of enticement is nothing more than to lure Britain into a trap and abandon its rights and interests in the Far East, while the purpose of threat is nothing more than to force Britain to disarm and abandon its rights and interests in the Far East. If Britain can abandon its rights and interests in the Far East, other countries such as the United States and France can follow suit. Thus, Konoe's proposal of December 22nd last year can be realized, and Japan's goal of excluding Europe and America and dominating East Asia can be achieved. This can be said to be Japan's more important intention.</p>
<p>The most recent manifestation of enticement is in Japan's non-participation in the Tripartite Military Alliance, which seems to have reached a delicate state of flirtatious overtures. As for threats, there are too many examples; as soon as Ambassador Kerr arrived in Chongqing, Chongqing suffered a major bombing; as soon as he arrived in Chengdu, Chengdu had an air raid warning, forcing the ambassador to spend the night in the open, catching a cold; the anti-British movement in the occupied areas is increasing day by day; recently, it has intensified and spread to Shanghai. For example, on Dixwell Road in Hongkou the day before yesterday afternoon, some underage children distributed so-called anti-British leaflets. This phenomenon of one positive and one negative simultaneously reaching a climax is nothing more than an indication that Japan's attempt on Britain has reached the degree of "monkey in a hurry," as the Shanghai dialect says.</p>
<p>Why is Japan in such a "monkey in a hurry"? From the subjective needs, Japan has known since the beginning of the war that it has little certainty of success. Therefore, on the one hand, it attempts to reduce the assistance of various countries to China, weakening China's ability to resist; on the other hand, it carries out the work of consolidating its power in the occupied areas, excluding the rights and interests of third parties in China, in order to achieve its ambition of exclusive occupation. Under this dual attempt, Japan believes that the most important target should be Britain, which has the deepest relationship with the Far East; therefore, its diplomatic work has always been focused on Britain. If Britain takes the bait and expresses its submission to him, this is certainly what the Japanese side fervently prays for; otherwise, as a backup plan, if Britain, because it cannot bear the annoyance of constant nagging, comes out to mediate peace, forcing China to accept a treaty under duress, it may not be an additional gain for the Japanese side. This wishful thinking of the Japanese side has certainly been around for a long time, not just recently; but recently its attempt has become more urgent. Originally, Japan's military situation in China is now gradually falling into an unfavorable position. Not only does the planned attack on the Northwest and Southwest by the "Itagaki Truce Line" have no certainty of success, but even the points and lines already occupied are also exposing a wavering appearance in the Chinese army's tentative April offensive. Therefore, under the emotion of anxiety and irritability, the Japanese army has to step up its search for a way out, so the attempt to use Britain has become even more urgent.</p>
<p>From the objective situation, the organization of the world's anti-aggression group has recently had the possibility of success; even if this organization does not include the Far East, if Europe can temporarily maintain a modest life, countries will shift their attention to the Far East, which is also a matter of course. The Japanese side is of course wary of this, so it hopes to seize the rights and interests of various countries in China as soon as possible before the anti-aggression group organization is completed. Britain is the country with the greatest interest in China, and at the same time, Britain occupies a leading position in the world's anti-aggression group organization. Therefore, under the concept of "to draw a bow, draw the strong; to catch a thief, catch the king first," Japan is again eager to exclude Britain.</p>
<p>In short, it is afraid of and hates Britain, and has always been so, and is even more so now; Japan hopes that Britain will be afraid of his nagging and fall into his trap, and has always had such a plan, but now it is planning more urgently. However, what is the effect of this attempt by Japan? In fact, as Japan step by step intensifies its pressure on Britain, Britain step by step intensifies its assistance to China; as Japan step by step threatens Britain's rights and interests in China, Britain step by step changes to using strong methods to protect its rights and interests; as Japan step by step attempts to divide the countries with Far East relations, Britain step by step unites the countries and takes consistent action. From all aspects, Britain not only has not fallen into Japan's trap, but also fully expressed its determination to safeguard its rights and interests in the recent Kulangsu incident. So, what did Japan get? What he got was the opposite of his expectations, namely, Britain's toughness and the unity of the countries with Britain's attitude. In fact, this helped China, not Japan. All the attempts of the Japanese side have obviously failed, and the means of capture and release that he has always used have ultimately found no room to be used.</p>
<p>From now on, the pseudo-anti-British movement orchestrated by Japan in China will probably not stop, but its essence will inevitably shift from the means of capture and release to acts of venting anger; however, this downhill method will only result in falling into a more anxious and irritable situation, and there will be no benefit to the facts!</p>
<h3>American Attitude is Firm, British Newspapers Express Excitement</h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian stated in an editorial today that Japan intends to create the Kulangsu International Settlement incident in Xiamen in order to test the reaction of Western powers, focusing on the more important situation in Shanghai. The most exciting point in the Kulangsu incident is the attitude of the US government. The US government first protested, first sent its commander-in-chief to Kulangsu, and first sent marines to land on the island. The United States has consistently expressed its willingness to cooperate with Britain and has never evaded its obligations. This attitude should inspire the timid British government, which still advocates a policy of appeasement in the Far East after the policy of appeasement in Europe failed. The only result of this policy is to encourage violent anti-British movements within Japan and in areas occupied by Japanese troops in China. Japan's movement is undoubtedly based on the theory of attacking the weakest point of the enemy's line. The United States is prepared to cooperate to protect our common interests in Kulangsu. From this, it can be inferred that the United States will also be willing to take the same action in Shanghai or elsewhere in the Far East if necessary. We are comforted by this, and the fear of many people that the Anglo-Soviet alliance will have an adverse effect on Japanese policy should also be dispelled. (Reuters, 19th) The full text of the US note to Japan is on page 6.</p>
<h3>Three Countries Suggest to Japan Simultaneous Withdrawal of Military Forces</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to information leaked from Japanese authorities today, the naval authorities of the United States, Britain, and France in Kulangsu yesterday jointly suggested to the Japanese naval commander that all armed soldiers in the International Settlement should withdraw together simultaneously. The content of the Japanese response to this suggestion has not yet been released. Naval authorities here believe that this report is quite accurate because all parties have discussed the plan to convene a meeting to discuss the withdrawal of all armed soldiers from Kulangsu. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government notified Japan yesterday, stating that the number of British Royal Marines landed in Kulangsu will be reduced to an equal number as the Japanese troops in that area. According to government sources, the number of British naval personnel currently landed in Kulangsu is indeed 42, which is exactly equal to the number of Japanese troops on the island. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<h3>Sawada Discusses Kulangsu Incident with British Ambassador</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sawada met with British Ambassador Craig yesterday to discuss the Kulangsu incident. At the same time, officials announced that Japan had responded to the British protest of May 16 regarding the landing of Japanese naval personnel in Kulangsu. The response stated that there were three reasons for the landing of Japanese naval personnel: emergency measures to arrest terrorists, to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents, and to protect the commander of the Japanese South China Fleet, who is currently visiting Kulangsu. At the same time, it was guaranteed that as soon as the tension in Kulangsu eased, the Japanese navy would gradually withdraw. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with US Ambassador to Japan Grew yesterday before Grew departed for home, informing him that the US rejection of Japan's proposal to reorganize the Shanghai International Settlement's Municipal Council will make it impossible to clarify the issues between the US and Japan in China. Arita continued that he believed that if the United States abandoned the idea of an international conference and engaged in direct negotiations with Japan, some issues between the US and Japan could be resolved, but only on the condition that the United States recognize Japan's general position in the Far East. Arita further stated that Japan's plan to "reorganize the Far East" does not hinder the development of American interests in China, and at the same time, Japan's development of its interests in the Far East outside of China will not conflict with the United States. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>Three Major Democratic Countries Jointly Protect Far Eastern Interests</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the naval landing of British, French, and American marines simultaneously in Kulangsu, China, government officials here commented that the three major democratic countries have a joint relationship and have now decided to jointly protect their interests in the Far East. The matter of merely protesting diplomatically has become a thing of the past. Germany and Italy are now pressuring Japan to join the military alliance treaty. If that country is encouraged by Germany and Italy to pursue an anti-French and anti-British policy, then Britain, France, and the United States should jointly take defensive measures to deal with it. The British government recently convened a Pacific conference in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, to discuss the protection of territories in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The defense plan agreed upon advocated cooperation between Britain and France to mutually protect all territories. The British government has notified France of the results of the conference, and the United States has also actually joined this defense organization. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Kulangsu incident and the Shanghai International Settlement issue were recently commented on by various newspapers, all saying that the attitude taken by Western countries is very satisfactory. The right-wing Petit Journal stated, "Britain, France, and the United States are now making simultaneous efforts in the Far East, no longer making any unilateral concessions. The United States government, regardless of the opposition of isolationists, is actively protecting its interests in China. This is why the Kulangsu incident has special significance." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Still Want to Advocate Taking Decisive Steps</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, newspapers prominently published the news of the US rejection of the Japanese request to reorganize the Shanghai Municipal Council and the landing of British, American, and French sailors in Kulangsu, stating that this move by the three countries has caused a delicate situation. It is generally believed that this is a test of Japan's strength and determination regarding the current international situation and the various issues related to the foreign concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin. According to the Asahi Shimbun, "After a Japanese marine unit withdrew, Britain and the United States sent sailors to land in Kulangsu, which is clear evidence of Britain and the United States taking an aggressive attitude. If Britain and the United States allow the 'Chiang Kai-shek regime' to orchestrate anti-Japanese organizations in the Shanghai International Settlement, then Japan should demand the transfer of the concession's administrative power. In view of the 'uncompromising' attitude of Britain and the United States, Japan's determination to stand firm is even more urgent than before." The Nichinichi Shimbun stated that Japan must take decisive steps to deal with the actions of Britain, the United States, and France. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Chinese Army Recaptures Key Area West of Zengcheng; Japanese Army in Shitan Suffers Surprise Attack by Chinese Army; Traffic Between Jiangcun and Guangzhou Interrupted</p>
<p>Wengyuan After the Chinese army recaptured Liaocun in Zengcheng, a unit attacked Caocun on the northern outskirts of Zengcheng on the morning of the 18th, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. By the evening, the Japanese army relied on strong fortifications and resisted with heavy artillery fire. The Chinese army continued to press forward, while another unit turned to Shetouling to launch a surprise attack. By the evening of the 18th, the Japanese army there had been surrounded by the Chinese army. Also, on the night of the 16th, a unit of the Chinese army attacked Fuhexu, and the Japanese army was unable to resist, fleeing to Shiqiao. At noon on the 18th, the Chinese army recovered Wushi (west of Zengcheng) and advanced towards Zhucun. At the same time, Chinese guerrillas completely destroyed railway bridges and power lines in the Shitan to Xiancun area of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army in Shitan, which was very successful. (19th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Japanese planes heavily bombed Gaoyao, Gaoming, Heshan, and Sihui in the lower reaches of the Xijiang River yesterday, and the situation is serious. The Xinhe, Jiangmen, and Foshan roads are still in fierce fighting as of the 19th. The Japanese army in the northeast Jiang area has increased reinforcements, and there will be fierce fighting. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan The Chinese army in Conghua recovered Mayazhuang on the 18th and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army across the river. As of 1:00 AM on the 19th, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Taipingchang. The Chinese army is pursuing across the river. Also, the Chinese army attacking Shengang advanced to Zhonglou on the morning of the 19th and captured Baitagang, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese army, killing and wounding more than 200 Japanese soldiers. The bloody battle was still ongoing near Baitagang on the morning of the 19th. (19th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan After the Chinese army recaptured Longkou Village in Huaxian, it fought fiercely with the Japanese army in Longxiangxu. By the evening of the 18th, more than 300 Japanese soldiers had been killed. The Japanese army in Longxiang has now been suppressed by the Chinese army, lurking in fortifications and stubbornly defending. The Chinese army is besieging. The Japanese army in Jiangcun Xinjie was also severely attacked, suffering heavy casualties. Currently, the traffic between Jiangcun and Guangzhou has been mostly destroyed by the Chinese army. (19th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to Japanese official reports, the Jiangmen Chinese Customs has been taken over by the Japanese authorities yesterday. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan A thousand Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops arrived in Yifutian at noon on the 16th. On the same day, several hundred Japanese infantry troops from Shitan advanced towards Boluo, sneaking to Xiyangning Lake west of Longhuaxu. The Chinese army intercepted and launched a bloody battle. By the afternoon of the 17th, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and fled to Shilong in Zengcheng. Also, on the morning of the 17th, the Chinese army attacked the Zengcheng troops and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army north of Zengcheng. The Japanese army could not resist and retreated to the suburbs, stubbornly resisting with fortifications. The Chinese army has recaptured Liaocun north of the city and is continuing to attack the city. (18th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Northern Hubei and Southern Henan for Two Weeks: Chinese Army Achieves Important Victory; Japanese Encirclement Fails, Communication Severed, Casualties Reach Half of Their Total; Main Force of Chinese Army Now Able to Control the Overall Situation; Rumor of Recapture of Zao Yang in Progress</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Laohekou Electric Dispatch: Fierce battles have raged in northern Hubei and southern Henan for two weeks. By the 18th, Japanese casualties had reached 17,000 to 18,000 men, accounting for nearly one-third of their total force. Their plan to invade Xiangfan has been shattered. Currently, the main force of the Chinese army is controlling the overall situation, continuing to engage in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the area north of Suixian and Zao Yang, and south of Tongbai and Xinye. Remnants of the Japanese army near Tanghe and Xinye have all been cleared. Chinese forces in the Zhongxiang area have occupied Majiaji and Xipanshi Bridge. More than 400 Japanese soldiers, arriving from Jingshan in over 70 vehicles, were ambushed by Chinese guerrillas and fled in disarray northwards along the highway. All the Japanese vehicles and supplies were burned by the Chinese army. Subsequently, the Japanese launched a counterattack, resulting in a fierce two-hour battle, in which over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese army reinforced from Dongqiao, and the situation remains in stalemate. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yichang) The Chinese army is advancing towards the Jing-Zhong Road, launching gradual attacks. On the 18th, they reached the vicinity of Sunqiao, poised to deal a fatal blow to the Japanese forces in Jingshan and Zhongxiang. The highway around Zaoshi on the Han-Yi Road has been destroyed by the Chinese army, and Japanese communication has been severed. In northern Hubei, the Chinese army recaptured the key points of Zhangjiaji and Gushan on the 18th, and is continuing to pursue the enemy westward. (19th Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Chinese and Japanese forces in central Hubei are still engaged in a state of mixed fighting. The front lines of each road have formed into a large tooth shape. The Chinese army's attacking units on the Han-Yi and Zhong-Jing Roads are still advancing bravely. If the Japanese army north of Zao Yang attempts to flee south, they will be affected by the Chinese army's rear attacks. Currently, there are signs that the Japanese army is receiving reinforcements. (19th Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese military authorities are unwilling to disclose details of the battle in northern Hubei, but according to reliable sources, the Chinese army has achieved an important victory in a well-planned and swiftly executed counteroffensive. However, as the battle is still in progress, the full significance of this victory will be seen later. Reuters learned from reliable sources that the Japanese army launched a sudden encirclement operation at the beginning of this month, hoping to surround the Chinese army in the Suixian area with two wings. At that time, the main force of the Chinese army in Tanghe immediately retreated in two directions, one heading north to Nanyang, and the other west to Xiangyang. After the Japanese army established communication in Tanghe, Tang Enbo's army corps launched a sudden counterattack, and the Chinese army that had previously withdrawn from Tanghe also returned at the same time to join the counterattack, creating a powerful force. The Japanese army, having penetrated deep into the area, felt fatigued and was cut off from the main force. They had no choice but to retreat to Zao Yang. It is estimated that more than ten thousand Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, passing through the foot of the Dahong Mountains, where the road was lined with the corpses of Japanese soldiers. According to Chinese military authorities, the Japanese side previously boasted of encircling 20 divisions of the Chinese army in northern Hubei, but now they are suddenly silent. This is proof of the Chinese army's victory. (19th Reuters Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanyang: The war situation in northern Hubei is progressing extremely rapidly since the Chinese army fiercely attacked. Yesterday, a certain unit of the Chinese army successively captured Dongyangwan and Laoying (both west of Zao Yang). In the afternoon, a certain unit recaptured Zhangjiaji and Lueshan and other places, killing a large number of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army abandoned their machine guns and fled. The Chinese army is advancing rapidly towards Zao Yang. There are rumors that Zao Yang has been recaptured. On the Zhongxiang front, the Chinese army fiercely attacked Xia Ya Port (near Wamiaoji) yesterday morning, annihilating over half of the Japanese army. Xia Ya Port was immediately recaptured. Currently, the Han-Yi Road has been cut off, and that area is surrounded by the Chinese army. (19th Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The Japanese army in southern Henan, having been routed by the Chinese army, fled in disarray to Zao Yang. More than 4,000 remnants of the Japanese army have now gathered in that area. Under the pressure of the superior Chinese army, they are unable to stand their ground. They withdrew in large numbers on the afternoon of the 18th, attempting to cross the river at Dongjinwan in a surprise attack, but were unsuccessful. They have now gathered in the Lueshan Fangjiaji area, but they no longer have combat capability. However, over 30,000 Japanese soldiers in Suixian, Junchuan, and other places appear to be preparing to invade westward. (19th Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) On the morning of the 16th, after the Chinese army recaptured Tongbai, the army took advantage of the momentum to attack. The remnants of the Japanese army fled in disarray towards the south of the city. Two or three hundred Japanese soldiers in Xiaolin Village east of Tongbai were also repelled by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 15th, a certain unit of the Chinese army encountered over a thousand Japanese soldiers in Jinqiao (east of Tongbai), engaging in a fierce battle until noon. The Japanese gradually became unable to withstand the attack and appeared to be fleeing eastwards. In this battle, hundreds of Japanese soldiers, including the Japanese captain Ueta, were killed, and countless spoils of war were seized. (19th Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Because telegraph communication between Xiangyang and Chongqing has been disrupted, the situation of the war in northern Hubei is quite unclear here. Chinese military figures still express optimism. It is said that the Japanese army advancing towards Xiangyang and Fancheng has been blocked by the Chinese army. As for the cause of the telegraph line disruption, it is the result of heavy bombing by the Japanese army. According to news received from the front lines, fierce battles are currently taking place in Zao Yang, 60 kilometers east of Xiangyang. The Japanese army is now attempting a semi-circular encirclement of Xiangyang, starting from Suixian in the north, Zao Yang in the center, and Zhongxiang in the south. The progress of this situation is still unknown. In order to resist the Japanese encirclement, the Chinese army suddenly launched a counterattack on the Han-Yi Highway, with satisfactory results. After recently recovering Yuejiakou and Wamiaoji, they are now pressing on the military stronghold of Qiuxian (transliteration). If they launch a surprise attack, the position of the Chinese army in Hanshui can be greatly relieved. (19th Haitong News Agency Electric Dispatch)</p>

The Chinese army's combat effectiveness and determination have been increasing day by day. The activities of its air defense forces have been particularly effective. Its air force has repeatedly bombed Japanese army positions, all with remarkable results. The activities of the Chinese guerrillas have also become more active. The Japanese army clearly has no hope of eliminating them. The result of this active operation by the Chinese army has made the vast majority of the Chinese people swear to resist aggression to the death and strive for final victory. Its spirit and will have become stronger. All aspects of its counteroffensive have been successful and have completely resolved all the tasks assigned by the highest military authorities."

<h3>At the National Production Conference: President Kong's Closing Address: Must Adapt to the Requirements of the Times, Strive for Practical and Effective Methods</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) In his closing address at the National Production Conference, President Kong said approximately: "Despite the obstruction of transportation, all members have enthusiastically participated in the conference after traveling long distances, concentrating their minds and jointly discussing the major plans for national production and construction. They have worked hard day and night, and have remained persistent throughout. I am deeply impressed by their calmness in handling affairs, their dedication, and their loyalty to the country. The essence of the production conference lies in mobilizing the nation's human and material resources to achieve the goal of making the best use of people's talents, land's resources, material's use, and goods' flow, so as to both enhance the power of resistance and lay the foundation for national construction. Our country is vast and populous, and the resources are abundant. The past shortcomings lie in the fact that power has not been mobilized, or that there have been attempts to mobilize but without concrete methods. In the future, we must respond to the needs of the times and strive for practical and effective methods, not indulge in empty talk, not pursue unrealistic goals, and in everything, we must have a broad perspective and start with small things, seek truth from facts, and achieve success. The ancients said that climbing high must start from low, and traveling far must start from near, which can be used as a guideline for our success in establishing our careers. The various proposals received by this production conference can grasp the core of the current various issues, are comprehensive and thoughtful, and are practical plans. The opinions expressed by the members are also mostly based on practical experience, with concise and clear explanations, and are concrete and unique contributions. After this conference, all domestic agricultural, mining, industrial, transportation, and economic production undertakings will have a more meticulous and progressive plan. If, after the closing of the conference, we can further refine and implement more effective methods based on these plans and adapt them to the actual situation in various departments and regions, and work hard to promote them, then the day the conference closes will be the time when new production is launched, and resistance and national construction will depend on it. Now, I will briefly state a few points that I have thought of for reference. First, no one should be wasted. The necessary conditions for production are labor, capital, and land. Our country is blessed with these three needs being fully supplied. The current problem is how to utilize these superior conditions so that nothing is wasted, and in terms of labor and technology, we should pay particular attention. Our country has the largest population in the world, and for thousands of years, it has been based on agriculture. In addition to farming and harvesting, the people in the countryside have plenty of leisure time. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, the number of unemployed people has been increasing day by day. This large amount of surplus labor should be used in some way to engage in production work. However, observing the current situation, on the one hand, there are gatherings of idlers in society who have nothing to do all day long, and on the other hand, production agencies feel the lack of labor, resulting in high wages and high production costs. As a result, not only can the country's production capacity not be strengthened, but unemployed idlers, under the pressure of hunger and cold, have become bandits in large numbers, and social order has been adversely affected. This contradictory phenomenon must be remedied. The best way to remedy it is to absorb idlers into production undertakings, assigning them appropriate work according to their inclinations, talents, and skills. Those who can engage in agriculture, industry, and commerce will benefit the country. Even if they repair bridges and roads, remove dirt and filth, it is not without benefit to society. We must hope that everyone will pay attention to planning, make proper use of them, integrate relief into production, and apply education and training to production, so that things are done by the right people, and people are able to make the best use of their talents, and then we can develop land resources, exhaust material resources, and facilitate the flow of goods. Second, no resources should be wasted. Our country's production is backward, and resources have not been fully utilized. It is a fact that the development of existing materials is not sufficient to meet current needs. However, a 5,000-year-old ancient country, various production mechanisms and methods, whether inherited from the past or imitated in recent times, can be improved and used to enhance national power, and there will be many supplements. Not to mention the various farming methods in agricultural production, which are deeply in line with modern scientific principles, even the old household industries, handicrafts, etc., have skills that can be adopted and applied. In terms of transportation, if modern trains, ships, and automobiles cannot all be fully self-sufficient, then the original means of transportation, such as horse-drawn carriages, camel transport, and handcarts, should be used and improved. There are countless examples of this, as long as we pay attention to promoting them. Third, we must pay attention to economy. There are many proposals at this conference that involve the organization and structure of production agencies, which is also very important, because if the production agency is large and complex, then there will inevitably be waste in terms of manpower and expenses, which will not increase the original intention of production. This kind of situation often happens in our country. For example, the population census is not too difficult, but the agencies for investigating household registration in various places are spending a lot of money, employing many people, and spending years and months, they still cannot get accurate statistics. It is unlikely that there are dozens of similar production undertakings. In the future, we must avoid redundant expenses as much as possible to reduce production costs. Fourth, we must choose the right time. There are very few things that have permanent value. Most things are time-sensitive. Things that were useful in the past may not be useful now. Things that are needed now cannot wait until the future to be prepared. Production undertakings must be divided into urgent and slow, and they must adapt to the times, so as not to waste energy and time. At the present time of the war of resistance, all military and social demands and supplies must be met without delay. Therefore, we should select some of the most urgent undertakings and create them as soon as possible. Those that are not related to national defense, military affairs, and the necessities of people's lives can be postponed or suspended. This point is very important. During this conference, which lasted for a week, more than two or three hundred proposals were discussed. All members were able to complete their tasks in a tense atmosphere. The process and results of the conference were good. In the future, we can ensure that this result is developed and expanded, which depends on how we implement it. Most of you are the heads of various production agencies and those who are actually responsible. I hope that you will be aware of the importance of your duties, work hard to accomplish things, establish a foundation for your careers, and make the greatest contribution to the country."

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Reporters in Chongqing Interview Japanese Prisoners of War; Captain Ueda Writes Impressions</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese and foreign reporters from this city visited twenty prisoners of war from the × War Zone this afternoon. The prisoners of war were all wearing gray uniforms and sitting on the floor. After greeting the reporters, a medium-sized man stood up. Upon inquiry, he was identified as Captain Ueda Susumu, the captain of the Japanese transport unit, from Hiroshima City, 33 years old. Although Captain Ueda and the other twenty-one men belonged to different units, because of his higher rank and longer association with them, they all regarded him as their leader. He introduced to the reporters that some were infantry, some were artillery, and one, Mr. Takagaki Imasaru, a mechanic only 21 years old, was the most sincere. It is said that before enlisting, he was a worker at a certain engine assembly plant, earning a salary of 3 yuan and 33 cents a day. His parents are still alive, and he has no siblings. He was ordered to enlist by the factory owner, which is slightly different from ordinary soldiers. After being captured, he received preferential treatment from the Chinese side. Apart from gratitude, he had nothing to say. In addition, Mr. Morikawa Tatsumatsu and Mr. Takahashi Nagaichi, both 35 years old, belonged to the 104th Regiment of the 13th Division and were both from poor farming backgrounds. They spoke honestly. However, the most knowledgeable person was still Captain Ueda, who had recently written an essay titled "Impressions." The gist of it was that he was ordered to come to China, deceived by warlords, and only after arriving in China did he learn the actual situation, which was completely different from what the warlords had said. After being captured, he was treated with sympathy by Chinese officers, soldiers, and intellectuals, which made him feel extremely grateful and moved to tears. In the future, he sincerely wishes to contribute his talents to China to repay their kindness and to promote the early end of the war so that everyone can enjoy the joy of equality and happiness.

<h3>Full Text of the U.S. Note to Japan</h3>
<p>The U.S. government's reply to the Japanese government's request to amend the Shanghai International Settlement Land Regulations was telegraphed in summary by the Associated Press and published in yesterday's newspaper. The full text was announced yesterday by the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai. A special translation is provided below:</p>
<p>Regarding the memorandum of May 3rd from the Japanese Foreign Ministry official regarding the amendment of the Shanghai International Settlement Land Regulations and the alteration and improvement of the administrative structure of the International Settlement sent to the U.S. Ambassador in Tokyo. The memorandum concerns the date on which the Shanghai International Settlement Land Regulations currently in effect came into force, and states that the existing administrative structure is in many respects unsuitable to cope with the gradual evolution of the past seventy years and the severe changes in recent times. The U.S. government, as always, is prepared to engage in friendly and orderly negotiations, properly established and conducted, regarding any amendments needed to the Shanghai International Settlement Land Regulations. However, the U.S. government must state that, in the opinion of the U.S. government, the situation in the Shanghai area is currently far from normal, and there is no prospect of obtaining an orderly solution to the complex problems involved, or a basis for discussions that would afford all parties concerned reasonable and fair treatment. As for the issue of Chinese courts in the International Settlement, it must be stated that these courts were established in accordance with multilateral agreements to which the U.S. is a party, and their status was determined accordingly. Observations regarding possible amendments to the Land Regulations are often applied to these courts as well.</p>
<p>Regarding the existing electoral system of the Municipal Council and the public meetings within the International Settlement, it should be known that according to the Land Regulations, there is no discrimination against foreign taxpayers. The minimum requirement for voting eligibility is the payment of municipal rates based on an annual rental of five hundred taels of silver (equivalent to seven hundred yuan in legal tender). Under this system, the Japanese community enjoys a large and increasingly important voting right. In fact, the proportion of votes held by the Japanese, relative to the total number of votes, is much higher than the proportion of municipal rates and land taxes paid by the Japanese to the total amount of municipal rates and land taxes collected by the Municipal Council. Moreover, the Japanese have representatives participating in the Municipal Council Board of Directors and are employed in various departments of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>As for the alteration and improvement of the administrative structure of the International Settlement, the U.S. government believes that the Japanese government will surely acknowledge that those involved in the administration of the International Settlement have often made adjustments throughout the settlement's history to cope with changing circumstances. The U.S. government trusts that the settlement authorities will continue to strive to adjust the administrative structure of the settlement, and its customs, to accommodate the fair and reasonable wishes of Japan and the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Regarding the claim in the Japanese memorandum that the settlement authorities should cooperate closely with the regimes that exist in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River with the aid of the Japanese army, it should be known that since there is no properly established and organized government in that area, the settlement authorities have always made various efforts to cope with the realities in the very difficult situation they face. The U.S. government feels that these authorities should expect various considerations from the Japanese civil and military authorities. Regarding this point, it should be pointed out that the International Settlement, from its very beginning, whenever disturbances have occurred in the surrounding areas, has made it its policy to avoid becoming involved in disputes arising from incidents outside the settlement boundaries. This avoidance is inherited from the international nature of the settlement, and from the natural promise inherent therein, namely, that no power enjoying benefits in the settlement, no matter how great its interests, should use developments originating elsewhere to discriminate against the international nature of the settlement.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is deeply impressed by the fact that the settlement authorities, even in the extremely difficult and tense atmosphere in Shanghai, have effectively and energetically minimized the disturbances and illegal activities that have occurred in the part of the International Settlement under their effective jurisdiction. The U.S. government reiterates the efforts made by the standing committee of the International Settlement in the past and continuing in the future to fulfill its normal duties. These efforts are often severely hampered and made more difficult by the illegal activities within the areas connected to the settlement, and by the Japanese army's refusal to return the area of the settlement north of the Suzhou Creek to the effective jurisdiction of the International Settlement authorities.</p>
<p>The U.S. government must inform the Japanese government that if the Japanese government were to frankly acknowledge the excellent work done by the settlement authorities in the past and at present, and immediately return to the settlement authorities full jurisdiction over the settlement area extended to the north of the Suzhou Creek, it would certainly improve the smooth operation of the settlement's administrative structure.</p>
<p>In summary, the U.S. government, in view of the fact that Shanghai is a center of great harmony that has been developed by the people of many nations for the mutual benefit of all, and that the International Settlement is a very important part of this development, believes that any issue that affects the status and welfare of the settlement inevitably involves many countries, including the U.S.</p>
<p>Regarding the amendment of the Land Regulations, the U.S. government, as stated above, believes that this is an issue that should await the development of a more stable situation. However, with regard to the administrative customs of the settlement, many adjustments have already been made to meet the needs of changing circumstances. The U.S. government believes that the settlement authorities are prepared to continue their best efforts to accommodate any reasonable requests aimed at continuing to make adjustments.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Yixing War, Japanese Planes Bomb the People Suffer</h3>
<p>Yixing Correspondence: Yicheng is a vital transportation hub between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, surrounded by mountains, and is a strategically important location for military operations. Since the Chinese army attacked Yixing, they once broke into the city, but the Japanese army resisted fiercely. The Chinese army continues to advance bravely. At the same time, major battles are also taking place in Caoqiao, Heqiao, Qitingqiao, Qishangong, and Fenqiao. The Japanese side dispatched reinforcements from Suzhou and Wuxi, under the command of Sakamoto, and confronted the Chinese army on three fronts. The Chinese army then abandoned the frontal attack, using flanking tactics, dispersing and avoiding the Gaocheng Hongtatou area. The Japanese side then dispatched 14 bombers successively, carrying out indiscriminate bombing in Nanyuesi, Luliping, Hongtatou, Gaocheng, Hejiadu, and Nanxin Street, dropping 60-70 bombs, resulting in heavy casualties among innocent people, and houses were destroyed. The area is now scarred and there is no way to provide relief. The city is short of food, and the residents who had returned to the city have long since scattered. The Japanese army now wants to demolish the houses of the residents outside the city walls to remove obstacles. The Chinese army is still deeply entrenched in the mountains, waiting for an opportunity to attack.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Forcibly Drafts Men for Combat</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese army is now forcibly drafting able-bodied men in various guerrilla areas, training them, and sending them to the front lines in different provinces to fight. They are also inducing them to plunder and loot at will. According to a recent report from Yangzhou, the Japanese army stationed in various parts of northern Jiangsu has implemented the forced conscription of men. Therefore, the young people in the various guerrilla areas feel extremely resentful and have risen up to join the guerrilla forces or have moved to the countryside. The Japanese army, because of the active presence of Chinese patriotic elements, has specially gathered Chinese traitors to organize assassination groups, led by Peng Yuxin.</p>
<p>The Taixian Children's Brigade, in order to expand the children's organization and mobilize all the children in the county to participate in the war of resistance, held its first symposium on the afternoon of the 10th in the park hall, gathering children from various schools and private schools to discuss specific items: (1) The symposium should be held weekly. Resolved: to be held every Sunday afternoon at 2 pm in the park. (2) Publish the joint declaration of the children of the county. Resolved: The Children's Brigade is responsible for drafting and submitting it to the next meeting for approval. (3) Promote singing movements. Resolved: Each school and private school should organize singing teams, and the representatives of each school should be responsible for the preparation. The Propaganda Department of the puppet Jiangdu People's Congress is now preparing to organize a so-called "Peace Promotion Sports Meeting," with Shen Mingzhu and Jiang Taihua as the president and vice president, respectively. Shen also colluded with unscrupulous merchants to purchase 1,000 piculs of rice and 2,000 bags of flour to prepare for emergency needs because the Japanese army in Yangzhou was facing a food shortage.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army Under Ren Once Captured the Town of Meili</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Chinese army under Ren Dashi, active in the Changshu Dongxiang area, attacked the town of Meili, located at the junction of Suzhou and Changshu, on the 16th in two groups. The puppet army stationed in the town at the time resisted, but soon the puppet army collapsed, leaving behind many corpses. When the Chinese army occupied the town, the residents of the town brought wine and meat to reward the soldiers. Soon, Ren's troops searched the vicinity and captured the puppet township director Xu Gansheng and many puppet soldiers, and took them to a certain place. Ren's troops stayed in the town for one night, and the next morning led their troops elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Anti-Aggression Talks Stalled Russia Again Rejects British Proposal Insists on Concluding a Tripartite Military Alliance British Foreign Secretary to Paris Today for Negotiations</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the formation of an anti-aggression bloc, the new British counter-proposal advocates: (1) the Soviet Union should guarantee Romania and Poland, and provide assistance immediately upon being subjected to aggression; (2) If Romania and Poland are subjected to aggression, Britain will immediately discuss joint assistance measures with France and the Soviet Union; (3) The British, French, and Soviet Union will expand the scope of guarantees to include other countries; (4) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will conduct political and military talks as soon as possible. It is reported that this new counter-proposal has been rejected by the Soviet Ambassador Maisky, and the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have effectively reached a deadlock.</p>
<p>Soviet sources here recently stated that the Soviet Union's proposal is to conclude a mutual assistance treaty between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, supplemented by a military agreement, and any other suggestions will be rejected. People close to the British government said that this Soviet proposal was beyond Britain's imagination. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Hoare met today for several discussions. It is heard that they do not intend to make any further proposals. When the House of Commons discusses foreign policy tomorrow, Prime Minister Chamberlain will explain the difficulties in the current negotiations, but everything will indicate that anything that hinders the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union should be avoided. Foreign observers here said that when the League of Nations Council meets in Geneva next week, the representatives of Britain and the Soviet Union may reach a compromise, with Britain accepting new binding obligations. However, the British government should consider the views of the Conservative Party and not enter into a formal alliance treaty with the Soviet Union. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky went to the Foreign Office for a short discussion with the government's foreign policy advisor, Sir Robert Vansittart. It is reported that he stated that his government still cannot accept the new counter-proposal put forward by Britain regarding the formation of an anti-aggression bloc, and insists that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must conclude an alliance treaty. Ambassador Maisky is scheduled to leave for Geneva tonight to attend the League of Nations Council meeting. Therefore, Britain and France will not continue negotiations before the Council meeting. According to well-informed sources here, the French government has indicated to the Soviet Union that since Britain has made efforts to bring its new counter-proposal closer to the Soviet Union's views, it is hoped that the Soviet government will pay attention to it. The previous negotiations are still deadlocked. It is hoped that after France's mediation, a compromise can be found to reconcile the views of both parties. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on the negotiations between Britain and Russia. His conclusion was, "Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to go to Paris tomorrow to exchange views with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet. It is believed that a practical way will be found to overcome the existing obstacles. I also firmly believe that we will formally announce to the House of Commons at the appropriate time that our country has formally concluded an agreement with the Soviet Union." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Lloyd George Advocates for a Quick Alliance with Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>(London) During today's foreign policy debate in the House of Commons, Lloyd George spoke first, earnestly urging the government to conclude a "heartfelt alliance" with the Soviet Union, stating that the decisions made by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the next few hours or in the next few days are far more important than any decisions made by the countries since 1914. When George began to speak, Soviet Ambassador Maisky entered the chamber and took his seat in the ambassador's gallery. George's speech was insightful and moving, focusing on the fears that the general public held about the attacks launched by dictatorial countries and asking the public to pay attention to the unprecedented preparations they had made. George said that the secrets obtained now are the same as those that existed in 1918, and their purpose is to intimidate us. The only way to turn hostility into friendship is to prepare the British army to deal with unforeseen events and to seek cooperation from countries that can resist aggression.</p>
<p>When George mentioned the Soviet Union, he said that several parties now want to avoid working with the Soviet Union. Britain has given guarantees to Poland and Romania, using this as a military proposal, without inviting the Soviet Union to join. I wonder what the House thinks about this? Why don't we quickly decide to advocate concluding a heartfelt alliance with the Soviet Union, with the same conditions as France, so as not to miss the opportunity?</p>
<p>George finally mentioned the dictatorial countries, saying, "We have already concluded friendship agreements with them (the audience laughed), we are now shaking their claws (the opposition cheered). At this moment, we are either participating in their celebration of bestial victory (the opposition cheered)."</p>
<p>Opposition leader Attlee then spoke, acknowledging that George had just described an extremely bleak but very realistic picture of the world situation. Attlee expressed dissatisfaction with the government's failure to make constructive efforts to seek peace, but only to wait in fear for the coming act of aggression, saying that we must recognize the Axis powers' policy of aggression, and that Europe now has an armed bandit, ready to demand of anyone, "Stand and deliver all you have."</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Lengthy Speech Announces British Policy and Strategy</h3>
<p>When Prime Minister Chamberlain rose to speak after Attlee, the audience cheered to show their respect. The Prime Minister said that he did not want to talk about foreign policy today, because this is a time of tension, anxiety, and suspicion. He knew that every word he said would not only enter the ears of the members of Parliament, but would also be transmitted to the world and studied under a magnifying glass. There are now some malicious people who are waiting for him to seize a piece of rhetoric uttered in a moment of excitement, and give it a meaning that the speaker never intended. Attlee has just said that the government should set a long-term peace policy, and that the colonial issue should be part of it. It should be known that we in Britain do not want to buy peace at the cost of concessions, because concessions will only lead to further demands. However, this does not mean that we refuse to discuss any method that can satisfy the reasonable wishes of other countries. Even if adjustments are made to the existing situation, it is not impossible. There are several issues that can be easily resolved simply by guaranteeing that they will be discussed in an atmosphere of goodwill. There are also many concessions that can be easily given, simply by confirming that these concessions will only be used for the purpose for which they are given, and not to incite military strategies to harm the freedom of others. We cannot gain anything by discussing the final peace terms until we have recognized or abandoned any aggressive plans imposed on the people of other countries and are satisfied. The German government has announced that it has no intention of aggression. However, the difficulty felt today is not only that the opposition party does not believe its words, but this situation is actually created by the German government itself (the audience cheered). If we can obtain this kind of recognition, if we can be sure that there is no aggressive intent in the relationship between Germany and other countries, or that the continued use of force is necessary, then I think we can retreat and declare what our intentions are, and what policies we should take in discussing permanent and half-way conditions. The greatest interest of our country lies in the maintenance of peace, and a solution that can take into account the needs, demands, and rights of other countries and ourselves is most beneficial to the interests of Britain. I believe that this is a kind of international spirit that I would like to discuss further on how we should propose a permanent peace strategy.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister recounted George's speech, saying that he believed that the seriousness of the situation should not be underestimated, but that George's remarks seemed too pessimistic. As for the rumors that Britain returned Czech assets to benefit Germany, they are completely unfounded. The Ministry of Finance does not allow any Czech assets to be returned to the part issued by the International Clearing Bank, but only provides a small amount of funds for refugees. The Prime Minister also mentioned the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia into Germany, saying that he did not know whether the German policy government itself recognized that this move would cause a huge reaction overseas. He believed that there was one thing that would make the public psychology feel even more deeply uneasy than the merger of this territory, that is, this kind of action is in direct contradiction with the solemn guarantees that the German policy government often gives to the world. Therefore, this contrary fact has completely shaken the sense of security and created a universal emotion in the world, that is, each small country that hinders Germany's ambitions will no longer be able to obtain security. It is our intention that, if we cannot put forward a certain new stabilizing factor, then the disintegration of a large part of Europe is imminent. The government believes that, in this kind of environment, it is responsible for joining with France to intervene and try to supply the above-mentioned stabilizing factors, and that because all parties are keenly aware of the fears of attack, it is necessary to act quickly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, "The guarantees we have given to Poland and Greece are not all the plans we have in mind. We may call this guarantee an emergency measure, but it is only to prevent the continued deterioration of the situation. There is still a need for more permanent measures to strengthen it and try to obtain assistance from other powerful or willing parties in other areas. I would like to explain that this policy is not motivated by hostility, but to make the European powers into a group of confrontations, and to accept war as an inevitable opinion. I do not recognize it as inevitable before the start of the war. The darker the situation, the more possible the outbreak of war, the more we should redouble our efforts to avoid it. We recognize that the policies of opposing groups are extremely unstable and therefore fundamentally dangerous. The policy we have adopted does not contain any aggressive elements, nor does it exclude the possibility of discussing all the opinions of all countries in a friendly spirit. This is indeed a policy of defense, which can only be used under certain conditions. The establishment of this state and our existence depend on the strength of others. This is a guarantee of resistance to armed aggression. We hope that this aggression will never occur. This policy seems to be necessary, because otherwise, there will never be a prospect of establishing a stable concept in Europe. Without this policy, trade and enterprise will come to a standstill, and the state of people's lives cannot be improved."</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, "Things are changing rapidly, and it is impossible to conclude an agreement in an instant. Therefore, I believe that the position of Britain and Turkey in the event of a war caused by aggression in the Mediterranean region should be clearly expressed to the world. We have declared that, in the event of an incident, we are willing to help each other and work together. However, the content of this declaration is not limited to the Mediterranean, because it recognizes the need to establish security in the Balkans. We have obtained a compromise on all the matters discussed, and there is no doubt that the results of the English and Turkish two countries will proceed to conclude a long-term article."</p>
<p>The Prime Minister finally mentioned the huge impression created by the above guarantees, and said, "We are doing our best in the country, which is not enough to fulfill the guarantees we have given, so we are eager to seek the participation of other countries to assist. This is why we are talking with Turkey and the Soviet Union. Our discussion with Turkey quickly revealed the common interests and forward-looking views of the two countries, so the two governments were able to issue a declaration on May 12. This declaration has received an extremely warm welcome. The satisfaction expressed by the general public can be seen as a sign of the high prestige of Turkey and the preciousness of its friendship. The Prime Minister expressed his warm admiration to Turkey and said that the friendship between Britain and Turkey began when Kemal was President, and has continued to strengthen after the current President took office.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also recounted the discussion between Britain and the Soviet Union, saying that he could not help but feel that there was a slight misunderstanding. I now want to reiterate it, and if we can find a way to obtain the cooperation and assistance of the Soviet Union to establish a peace front, we will naturally be welcome, because we need and value it. We despise the Soviet Union's ability to be a Deputy Director of the Construction Project of the Siberian Heilongjiang Railway, recently published a statement to the press, elaborating on the status of the largest construction project of the third five-year plan. It is said that the area through which this railway passes is rich in gold, tin, coal, and other useful minerals, and the forests in some areas are endless. The construction of this railway will enhance the connection between the Far East and Siberia, and will have a decisive significance for the development of industry in the Far East and along the line. At present, the construction project is in full swing, and the vast work of blasting mountains and building roads has been carried out in all sections. The mountain rocks blasted at one time often reach more than 100,000 cubic meters. The line passes through more than 3,000 large and small rivers, including the Lena River, Angara River, Saiya River, and Heilongjiang. All the bridges on the line, if connected into one, can pass from France to England. The area where the line's construction project is underway is now being developed for settlement and land reclamation. The land has been surveyed, and the future collective farm village houses have also been started. Several villages have been completed, and their collective farms have been distributed land, livestock, and agricultural implements for permanent use. Not long ago, places that were inaccessible to humans will now be prosperous collective agricultural areas. The time for the completion of each section of the line has long been stipulated by the government separately. Most of the money for the whole line will be able to start operating next year. From then on, the roar of the locomotive will break the silence of the forest, and the passion and perseverance of people will create an amazing transportation artery between the ice and snow.

<h3>Churchill Expresses Surprise</h3>
<p>(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons, Churchill, the leader of the far-right wing of the Conservative Party, expressed surprise at the difficulties in the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. If Britain, France, and the Soviet Union conclude an alliance treaty, they can invite other countries to sign and join it. He expressed his satisfaction with the fact that Britain and Turkey had agreed on a mutual assistance agreement, and said that since the British and the Soviet Union had concluded an alliance treaty, Poland and the Baltic countries would not object, and Spain and Portugal might not approve. The conclusion of a strong alliance treaty by all peace-loving countries is also a good way to persuade Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to part ways with his partners. Finally, Foreign Office Secretary Butler delivered a speech, representing the government to conclude the debate, stating briefly that the British and both countries were still continuing negotiations, and the government was studying the views of the Soviet Union with sympathy. In addition, the government does not intend to recognize Germany's annexation of the two provinces of Bohemia and Moravia. (Havas, 19th) The opinions and the direction we should take in discussing permanent peace conditions, the greatest benefit to our country lies in the maintenance of peace, a solution that can pay attention to the needs and demands of other countries and ourselves, is most beneficial to the interests of Britain, I believe this is a kind of international spirit that he is willing to discuss further on how we should propose a permanent peace strategy.</p>

<h3>Ten Thousand Spanish Troops Enter Madrid; German and Italian Troops Also Participate; Will Withdraw to Their Countries Soon</h3>
<p>Madrid – General Franco formally entered Madrid today, reviewing 100,000 victorious troops, including 10,000 Italian soldiers and 4,000 German soldiers. After the parade, the Italian and German troops will be transferred back to their respective countries. (Reuter, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid – Spanish Commander-in-Chief General Franco entered Madrid in a motorcade at 9 a.m. this morning, driving directly to the reviewing stand. He was accompanied by various commanders and senior government officials. Representatives of the diplomatic corps attending the ceremony included the German Ambassador Stohrer and the Italian Ambassador Viola. The grand military review began at 9 a.m. sharp. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<p>Spanish Commander-in-Chief Franco</p>
<p>Madrid – The Nationalist Army began its triumphal entry into the city at 9:10 a.m. today. Commander-in-Chief General Franco, cabinet members, and military leaders all participated in the grand event. Except for the Minister of Justice, Rodriguez, all cabinet members wore military uniforms. Along the parade route, stands were erected on both sides, all filled to capacity. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The Spanish Nationalist Army began its triumphal entry into the city at 9 a.m. this morning. The participating troops were led by German "Condor Legion" soldiers, followed by the Italian Army's "Black Arrow" Division, then the four divisions of the Spanish headquarters from the central, southern, northern, and western regions, followed by the wireless team, propaganda team, cavalry team, tank team, anti-tank artillery team, anti-aircraft artillery team, mechanized artillery team, and searchlight team. In addition, several squadrons of new-style fighter planes soared overhead. As each unit passed in front of Commander-in-Chief General Franco, they shouted "Long live Spain." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>The King and Queen of England Arrive in Ottawa</h3>
<p>Ottawa – The King and Queen of England arrived here today and were warmly welcomed by the people. (Reuter, 19th)</p>
<p>Montreal – The King and Queen of England arrived here at 7:14 p.m. yesterday. The streets were filled with flags and bunting, and an estimated 1.2 million people stood along the route to welcome them. The cheers were deafening. The welcoming ceremony was the same as in Quebec. The King and Queen traveled 24 miles in an open car. When passing through the French countryside, they entered the Montreal Stadium, circling it once. 85,000 children who spoke French in the stadium cheered. The King and Queen signed the city's "Golden Book" and then arrived at Molson Stadium, where they were welcomed by 15,000 children who spoke English. Along the way, a group of Red Indian people paid their respects to the royal carriage with their ancient marching calls. Shortly after, a grand welcoming banquet was held at Windsor Residence, with speeches in Old French Canadian. When the royal train traveled from Quebec to Montreal, it briefly stopped at Trois-Rivières station along the way. The mayor and city councilors of the area, along with their families, waited at the station to welcome them. Another 75,000 factory workers and students gathered around the station, cheering from afar. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<h3>Relations Between Northern European Countries and Germany; Germany Announces the Progress of Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Berlin) – The official announcement stated that after Führer Hitler delivered a speech in the Reichstag on April 28, declaring his willingness to sign non-aggression pacts with certain European countries, the German government conducted separate negotiations with Estonia, Latvia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. As of now, the results can be summarized in three points: (1) The non-aggression pacts negotiated between Germany and Estonia and Latvia are nearing completion. (2) The agreement between Germany and Denmark has been agreed upon in principle and will be signed as soon as possible. (3) Norway, Sweden, and Finland have all stated that they do not feel threatened by Germany and are determined to maintain neutrality, independence, and territorial integrity, and do not intend to sign non-aggression pacts with any country, including Germany, as they are unnecessary. Foreign observers here have commented on this matter, saying that Lithuania signed an agreement with Germany in March, containing non-aggression clauses. The announcement issued by the German government today did not mention the country at all, which is noteworthy. In addition, Führer Hitler said in his speech to the Reichstag that Germany was willing to guarantee the security of any country that wished to be protected by Germany. Therefore, the proposal to conclude non-aggression pacts originated from Germany and did not wait for the initiation of other countries. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Arab Countries Oppose the British White Paper; Jews Clash with British Authorities; The Palestine Problem is Very Thorny</h3>
<p>Cairo – The Egyptian government today sent a note to the British government, stating that it could not persuade the Palestinians to accept the White Paper. Egypt, the Kingdom of Hejaz, and Iraq do not approve of the British plan. The Arabic newspaper Al-Balagh stated that this British policy lacks wisdom and its ultimate goal is clearly to colonize Palestine with Jews. We hope that the Palestinians can obtain the support of the English who have freedom of thought. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>Capital of Iraq – Regarding the Palestine issue, after the British government issued the White Paper, the Iraqi government submitted a memorandum to the British government, expressing its opposition. It was very lengthy. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem – Regarding the Palestine issue, the White Paper issued by the British government yesterday has aroused strong reactions from the Jewish community. The Arab community has also expressed dissatisfaction. The Supreme Committee of the Arab community held an emergency meeting tonight to discuss it and issued a communiqué after the meeting, announcing its rejection of the British government's proposal. The reason given was that the content of the White Paper was no different from the opinions previously put forward by the British government during the London Round Table Conference. At that time, the Arab representatives strongly rejected it because it did not meet their demands and it is not appropriate to accept it now. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem – Yesterday, thousands of Jews gathered to demonstrate. At first, they were orderly, but due to the instigation of radicals and the support of young troublemakers, they tried to rush into the local government office, but were blocked by the police. The British police were attacked by demonstrators throwing bricks and remained calm for several hours. When two policemen were injured by rioters, they charged into the crowd. One British policeman died and twelve were injured, and one hundred Jews were injured. The authorities turned off the lights, and the road was as black as pitch, and the rioters dispersed. Order gradually recovered, and armed vehicles patrolled the streets. The Jews have now resumed work, and the shops are open. During the disturbance last night, a post office branch was set on fire by the crowd, and a British department store and a German café were destroyed by rioters. (Reuter, 19th)</p>
<h3>Regarding Chamberlain's Speech</h3>
<p>The claim of giving aid is completely unfounded. The House may recall Mr. Stalin's recent remarks that the policy of the Soviet Union is to aid countries that are invaded and willing to defend their independence. This is in line with our opinion. This statement seems to indicate that the Soviet Union may be willing to cooperate, and to make this happen, we also know that this point has not been taken seriously so far. Therefore, the direct participation of the Soviet Union may not fully meet the wishes of other countries that are making this arrangement for them. We want the cooperation of all countries, and we do not want any divisions among the countries. Therefore, we suggested to the Soviet Union that they issue a declaration to Poland and Romania that is the same as that of Britain and France. The Soviet Union obviously believes that this kind of provision is not of a mutual nature. What I want to tell the House now is that the British government has never wanted to ask the Soviet Union to do things that we ourselves are unwilling to do (cheers from the crowd). The British government has always wanted all arrangements to be mutual. What is now incomprehensible is why our proposal is considered to lack reciprocity. This proposal may be considered not to include certain countries outside the Baltic states, because they are neighbors of the Soviet Union, or someone may attack the Soviet Union through their borders. In fact, this is not the case. This proposal is not applied equally to several Western European countries. If these countries are attacked, we will definitely join the war. His intention above is sufficient to show that our proposal did not consider that the Soviet Union should intervene regardless of whether Britain and France are involved in the war. However, the guarantee we issued has therefore assumed obligations regardless of whether the Soviet Union joins us. This is a clear fact. Therefore, if there is any inequality between the two parties, this inequality actually benefits the Soviet Union, not Britain. Now the Soviet Union obviously has some misunderstandings, but no matter what comments criticize our proposal, he dares to say that it cannot be described as unfair. However, since the proposal was rejected by the Soviet Union, we have once again made special efforts. We sincerely want to quickly reach a compromise with each other. Now, please remember that what we are trying to do in this special article is not only to form alliances between Britain and other countries, but also to resist aggression and build a peace front. If the cooperation of one country is guaranteed, and another country is made uneasy by it, and is unwilling to cooperate with us, then our policy cannot succeed. This matter contains huge difficulties and subtleties, and must be handled with caution. This is not due to differences in doctrine, nor is it due to pure stubbornness, but entirely because the purpose of our policy is to create this kind of peace front. I would rather delay for a few days than act rashly, so that the work that has already been carried out will be shattered before our eyes. We believe that the Soviet Union may be willing to announce that they agree with the events that we can agree with, and prepare to continue to discuss the issues on which we have different opinions at length. We believe that this is an enlightened approach, but the Soviet Union's decision not to allow Potemkin to attend the Geneva conference in person is regrettable. The Council of the League of Nations postponed the meeting for a week because Mr. Bo could not arrive immediately. Now that it has been postponed for a week, he still cannot come, which has caused Foreign Minister Halifax to lose the opportunity to discuss issues that are beneficial to both parties with Mr. Bo in person. The Soviet Union must have its own sufficient reasons for adopting this attitude. He can't help but feel that there is a curtain or wall separating the two governments, which is extremely difficult to break through. The Prime Minister continued, we have had close contact with France in the course of the above events. There is no disagreement between Britain and France. Foreign Minister Halifax will have the opportunity to continue discussions with French Prime Minister Daladier and French Foreign Minister Bonnet tomorrow. He believes that after this discussion, it may be possible to discover ways to overcome the obstacles that prevent Britain and the Soviet Union from reaching a compromise. (Reuter, 19th)</p>

<h3>Serious Alert in Both Concessions for the First Time in Months; Curbing Political Agitation and Crime; Garrison Troops and Detectives Fully Mobilized Yesterday; Searching Pedestrians and Residents, the Situation is Serious</h3>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions in this city suddenly took various necessary precautions from late at night the day before yesterday. All roads and alleys at the boundaries of the two concessions were sealed off, with only ten places such as Yuqiaqing Road accessible. British and American garrison troops and White Russian mercenaries were deployed to patrol and search pedestrians. The French Navy increased its defense in the Xujiahui Tushanwan Church area of the French Concession, and the alert was extremely tight. The French Police Department also dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to conduct searches of residents in various areas and alleys, and the situation was particularly tense. The details of the investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Important Reasons for the Concession Alert</p>
<p>The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reported that a certain Chang of the Public Works Bureau told reporters this morning (the 19th) that Shanghai cannot become an arena for political agitators or armed bandits. The sooner this is understood, the better. This is the reason for the alert by the military police and volunteers of the Public Concession and the French Concession today. (Since the two concessions were tightly guarded, rumors have spread everywhere. Seeing this news now, it should be reassuring.)</p>
<p>Meticulous Planning for Several Days</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's engineering team set up barbed wire barriers at several road entrances from the Public Concession to Edward Road at night. At 5:00 in the morning, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps received orders to prepare for deployment, and armored vehicles patrolled the roads during lunchtime. Concession police searched extensively throughout the day. French troops patrolled the roads of the French Concession, and American Marines and British soldiers patrolled the roads of the Public Concession. The meticulous planning of the two concessions had been going on for three or four days. Although they remained silent, there were slight leaks, which led to alarming rumors. It was not until last night that they decided to implement the plan.</p>
<p>Signs of Political Disturbances Appear</p>
<p>When citizens went out in the morning, they were surprised to see barbed wire fences placed at the entrances of various roads and armed soldiers patrolling the roads. A police officer said that the plan was a "practice alert" and could be implemented at any time. There have been signs of political disturbances recently, so the military police are working hard to curb them. If everyone is determined to be a good citizen, the public will not be inconvenienced by the measures taken now. The Public Works Bureau teams began setting up barbed wire fences on various roads from midnight. At road entrances designated for traffic, movable barriers were erected, but police teams were stationed there to carry out searches. In order to quickly set up barriers, the Public Works Bureau used circular rather than rectangular barbed wire nets in many places, as they were easier to transport.</p>
<p>Multiple Arrests Result from Searches</p>
<p>Police teams searched pedestrians and people in vehicles at various key points. As for the "badlands" area in western Shanghai, strong police teams also searched pedestrians at various road entrances in the Public Concession. As of the time of writing today, the official announcement of the number of people arrested has not yet been obtained. However, it is believed that several suspects have been arrested and several pistols have been seized. Since 6:00 in the morning, the French Concession has been searching residences in various districts and is expected to continue searching throughout the day. Members of the French Volunteer Corps also mobilized this morning, driving many of the light armored vehicles used by the police department. Special police officers of the French Concession are prepared to stand by and are expected to mobilize tonight to replace the regular police teams.</p>
<p>Sealing Off at Various Intersections</p>
<p>Since Japanese troops landed on Gulangyu Island, the situation in the two concessions in this city suddenly became tense. However, after the solemn expression of Britain and the United States, it has recently eased. However, starting at 0:30 a.m. yesterday, the Public Concession authorities suddenly deployed barbed wire fences to all roads and alleys intersecting with the Inner Concession along Edward Road and Avenue Foch, implemented a blockade, and took necessary precautions. Yesterday morning, traffic on various roads was mostly blocked, and only ten places such as the Bund, Sichuan Road, Henan Road, Zhejiang Road, Yuqiaqing Road, Tongfu Road, Maho Road, Weihaiwei Road, Seymour Road, and Haig Road were accessible. However, additional Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to station at each road entrance to search all vehicles and pedestrians entering the Public Concession from the French Concession. The situation was similar to the "August 13th" Shanghai War Memorial Day last year. In addition, along the Suzhou Creek, except for the Old Rubbish Bridge, which was only guarded by detectives, the other bridges were also equipped with barbed wire fences, leaving only passages to allow pedestrians to enter and exit.</p>
<p>Garrison Troops and Detectives Mobilized for Patrols</p>
<p>British and American garrison troops stationed in Shanghai, White Russian mercenaries, and Chinese and Western detectives from the police station were all mobilized yesterday. British troops were responsible for guarding the area from the Bund to Yuqiaqing Road. White Russian mercenaries also rode in armored vehicles to patrol various roads. In the western Shanghai area near the extra-mural road construction section, American garrison troops sent troops to defend, carrying machine guns and automatic rifles, patrolling back and forth, with extremely tight security. At the same time, various police stations dispatched a large number of detectives to station at various important road entrances to search pedestrians.</p>
<p>French Navy Increases Defense of Tushanwan</p>
<p>During the westward retreat of the National Revolutionary Army, the Tushanwan Catholic Church area on Xujiahui Road in western Shanghai was approved by the National Government and the Municipal Government to be included in the jurisdiction of the French Concession. Recently, the Japanese side protested to the French authorities, requesting the return of the area. However, it has been strongly rejected by the French authorities. In order to prevent unforeseen circumstances, the French garrison authorities specially dispatched 200 French naval soldiers to the area yesterday morning to reinforce the defense. At the same time, the French police station also dispatched more than 70 Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives to assist in the defense, with extremely tight security. Chinese and Western detectives from the French police station searched shops and residences door-to-door in Xiaoyou Lane, Haige Lane, the old street of Xujiahui Town, Haige Road, and Hongqiao Road. At the same time, the French Navy's Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai and the armored vehicle team patrolled back and forth and checked pedestrians and vehicles. The defense at the Tushanwan Catholic Church and the blockade line at Hongqiao Road was very strict, with temporary additional double posts and barbed wire fences surrounding the area.</p>
<p>French Concession Searches Residences</p>
<p>The French Police Department issued orders to all police officers in all districts of the French Concession yesterday morning to mobilize and go to various roads and alleys to search shops and residences. Starting from the Bund of the French Concession, along Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Joffre, Avenue Foch, and all the way to Avenue Albert, the residents of the roads and alleys were searched separately, and the names and occupations of the residents were questioned. The HSBC Building in Zhonghui at the Big Ben Tower was also searched around 3:00 p.m. yesterday, but nothing was found. In addition, the armored vehicle team, the machine vehicle patrol team, and the French Navy Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai were also ordered to mobilize and patrol the streets, searching pedestrians passing by.</p>
<p>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Fully Prepared</p>
<p>The Chinese and foreign police officers in the police stations of the Public Concession's Public Works Bureau are now not allowed to take leave and are stationed in the police stations at all times for dispatch. The volunteer special police officers have also been assembled. As for the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the B Company of the White Russian mercenaries, with more than 300 people, is the one that is usually mobilized. However, at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, the Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Henry B. Peake, issued a preparatory order. The A Company of the cavalry team (i.e., the English team, the Scottish team, the Jewish team, the anti-aircraft team, etc.), the B Company (i.e., the American team, the Philippine team, the American machine gun team, etc.), and about 2,000 members of the various national teams were ordered to prepare for mobilization. When they receive the mobilization order, they must assemble within five minutes to await dispatch.</p>
<p>Various Measures to Maintain Public Security</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions took emergency precautions yesterday, the situation in this city, which had already eased, suddenly became tense again. Most citizens are speculating about it. However, according to the reporter's investigation with the relevant parties, the measures taken by the two concessions yesterday were entirely to maintain good order within the concession and protect the residents' peace and tranquility. There were no special events to cause alarm. Also, there was no change in curfew hours yesterday evening. The public believes that unless the situation requires it, the alert will not be advanced. However, the police department will intensify the alert in the evening.</p>

<h3>While the Situation in the Concession is Tense, the Japanese Consul Returns to Shanghai as Scheduled; Japanese Newspapers Describe Japanese Intentions; There is Still a Possibility of Further Occupation of the Concession</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that the Japanese-language Continental News stated last night (the 18th) that after Japanese Consul General Miura returns to Shanghai on May 27 after meeting with Japanese government leaders in Tokyo today, Japan's policy on the Public Concession issue is likely to undergo new developments. The attitude of the authorities here towards the Public Concession has recently reached the "final stage." Tokyo government officials have also decided on</p>
<p>Basic Policies</p>
<p>Accordingly, "thoroughly reform the situation in the Public Concession to adapt to the new situation." Miura is currently meeting with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the events in the Public Concession and other issues in Central China and will return to Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru. When spokespersons for the Japanese Army and Navy met with reporters from various newspapers yesterday, they claimed that if</p>
<p>Major Events</p>
<p>The Japanese military will occupy the Public Concession if an event occurs in the Public Concession that conflicts with Japanese interests. He also stated that a "major event" would trigger a large military action across the Suzhou Creek bridges into the southern bank. According to reports, the spokesperson made these remarks in response to reporters' inquiries about disputes arising in casinos in this city. He also said that the Japanese Army and Navy have decided that the only way to treat Chinese patriotism is to govern the Public Concession or the French Concession, just like the</p>
<p>Rule of Hongkou</p>
<p>However, the spokesperson also said that if a major event occurs, it is not impossible for the Japanese military to be forced to enter the Public Concession. The interpreter added that the Navy spokesperson had already expressed this situation two weeks ago. The Army spokesperson's opinion is now the same as theirs. The Japanese Ambassador's spokesperson said that the return of Hongkou and Yangshupu to the jurisdiction of the Public Concession authorities "will be very slow." The Public Works Bureau is</p>
<p>Resuming Management</p>
<p>There are many obstacles to the northern district of Suzhou Creek. One of the Japanese goals is to "maintain peace and order." When asked if there was no peace and order before August 1937, the spokesperson replied that before the war in 1937, many Japanese soldiers were assassinated in Hongkou, so it cannot be said that there was peace and order in that area. The spokesperson made these remarks because Washington announced its rejection of the Japanese side's request to amend the Shanghai Public Concession</p>
<p>Land Regulations</p>
<p>So that the Public Works Bureau would approve the request to add Japanese representatives. Yesterday, Sir Marshall, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, also stated that I believe that the explanation of the American rejection of the Japanese request to amend the Land Regulations is a very fair comment on the situation here. Unless the entire Public Concession is returned to unified management, normalcy cannot be restored.</p>
<h3>American Ship Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reported that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet submarine tender USS Canopus and submarine S-38 sailed to Shanghai from Manila and will arrive in port at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 20th) and will dock at the Huangpu River buoy. In addition, the U.S. ship Asheville is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 10:30 a.m. today and sail to South China.</p>
<h3>The Detained Five Chinese Have Not Been Released</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the five Chinese being detained, the Japanese spokesperson claimed that they had been released. The reporter conducted a detailed investigation, and the five Chinese have not yet returned home and are still being detained in Hongkou. The so-called release is highly questionable.</p>
<h3>The Meat Industry Resumes Operations This Morning; Meat Prices in the Market Have Stabilized; Merchants Are Making Every Effort to Circulate Sources</h3>
<p>The fresh pork industry accepted the advice of the concession authorities and resumed operations yesterday, first selling existing pigs. However, they still adhered to their original position and refused to participate in any illegal organizations. The French Concession Slaughterhouse and the Public Concession's Xinninghai and Suxi Slaughterhouses resumed slaughtering pigs last night. Fresh meat merchants throughout the city will resume selling meat from today. Yesterday, meat prices in the meat market stabilized due to the resumption of operations in the fresh pork industry. The industry discounted the price to 12 taels per yuan. The price of leg meat sold at the door was 3 taels per yuan, and streaky pork was 5 taels per yuan. As for the pigs shipped to Shanghai on Japanese, German, and Italian ships in recent days, there were one or two thousand heads. Fortunately, they were detained by the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. It is reported that merchants are making every effort to unblock the sources in order to maintain the food problem for the people of the two concessions and are determined not to be obstructed by anyone and continue to accept and transport the pigs.</p>

<h3>Rice Market in Extreme Chaos; Authorities Urgently Need to Thoroughly Investigate; Price Limits Cannot Be Enforced; Wuhu Rice Indeed Has Been Decontrolled</h3>
<p>Due to speculation and manipulation by hoarders in the Shanghai soybean and rice market, rice prices have soared beyond the price limits. The Management Committee is unable to enforce restrictions, resulting in a serious situation. Rice prices have skyrocketed, and the price limits exist in name only. Yesterday, the situation was reported to the Soybean and Rice Trade Association to seek solutions. Now Wuhu has lifted the ban, and rice merchants are ordering foreign rice, so the entire food supply for the population can be temporarily assured. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Price Limits Fail; Market in Chaos</p>
<p>After the Soybean and Rice Trade Association issued decrees with penalties, strictly enforcing price limits and cracking down on black market transactions, the price of top-grade white rice has risen to over seventeen yuan due to speculation and manipulation by hoarders. The prices of all grades of rice exceed the limits. All 105 firms are treating black market transactions as formal business, making it impossible for the Market Management Committee to enforce penalties. The market chaos is unprecedented, creating the most serious problem. However, the daily transaction volume has increased from several thousand bags to over ten thousand bags.</p>
<p>Black Market Reports Cannot Be Suppressed</p>
<p>The chairman of the Market Management Committee, Fu Qian'geng, received a threatening letter the day before yesterday, roughly stating: "The cost of rice is high, and shipping rice to Shanghai is affected by the price limits, resulting in significant losses. If you dare to continue strictly enforcing price limits, we will not be able to operate. Therefore, we hope you will abandon the policy as soon as possible, or we will resort to severe measures." As a result, the Market Committee immediately convened a meeting and reported the situation to the Soybean and Rice Trade Association, requesting a quick and proper solution to maintain the food supply for the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Admonishing Rice Merchants is the Best Policy</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, we have received your letter stating that the over-limit black market transactions are caused by the sellers raising prices, which is improper, but the buyers bidding high prices are equally at fault. Please admonish the rice merchants not to bid high prices, and hope that all rice merchants will report such actions, etc. We have received and understood. It is clear that over-limit black market transactions are becoming more intense and can no longer be concealed. Why wait to report? Yesterday, the market price called out was 17.70 yuan. To get to the root of the matter, the sellers take the initiative, and the buyers listen to the market prices. If the sellers do not call out prices exceeding the limits, then the buyers will never bid high prices and sell at a loss in the store. Under the current situation, the most effective way to clarify the black market transactions is to ask your association to strictly admonish all rice merchants not to raise prices beyond the limits, so that price limits can be maintained and black market transactions can be completely eliminated. Regarding your request to admonish all rice merchants not to bid high prices, our association believes this is a major issue. Rice merchants directly supply the food for the entire city. If this results in a shortage of rice for sale, causing panic and affecting public order, and your association can take full responsibility, then our association will follow your instructions and notify all rice merchants to absolutely not buy beyond the limits. Otherwise, it would be merely a superficial gesture that does not help the situation. This is a special reply. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association, from the Shanghai Rice Merchant Association.</p>
<p>Rice Merchant Association Clarifies the Truth</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, after reading the letter from your association to our association in the newspaper, we were extremely surprised. Therefore, we have a few words we would like to tell your association, hoping you will consider them. Our industry is in direct contact with consumers and sells goods. We must have goods before we can supply the market. We cannot buy today what we need today, or buy tomorrow what we need tomorrow. This is a well-known fact. Moreover, there are many varieties of rice, and it is difficult to decide what to buy. A large supply of one variety may have limited demand, while a small supply of another may be in great demand. No rice merchant can avoid replenishing their stock for ten days. This is also well-known to your association. Currently, in the rice market, hoarders are competing to raise prices. For half a month, prices have exceeded the limits. Yet you want our merchants to strictly comply with the price limits for sales and not buy rice at all. This is unreasonable and factually impossible. Instead of trying to stop the hoarders' manipulation and monopoly (many of your association members are hoarders), you blame our members for not being able to refuse to buy, so that sellers cannot exceed the limits even if they want to. If our industry complies with your letter and refuses to buy, and then our stores run out of rice, causing great panic among the citizens, would your association be able to take full responsibility? Moreover, the sellers raise prices and the hoarders release prices, and all the power is in the hands of your members. How can our industry interfere? If your members had not vigorously absorbed and hoarded rice with the hoarders, rice prices would not have reached today's high. You are clear about blaming others but ignorant about blaming yourselves. Your association should ask yourselves if you are not ashamed of the four million citizens of the isolated island. Furthermore, since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai has experienced several rice shortages. If the authorities in the two concessions had not made every effort to maintain the supply, how could we have overcome these difficulties? Last year, there was a bumper harvest, and the supply to this city was abundant, causing rice prices to fall back to normal. At that time, we could have stored rice to prepare for future needs, to avoid another rice shortage like before. However, you did not do this because your leaders are also engaged in re-exporting. Taking advantage of the low rice prices, you re-exported large quantities and set the price limit at 14 yuan to gain a good reputation, saying that re-exports of high-grade white rice would stop at the limit. At that time, we were entering the new harvest season and trusted your association, not considering other possibilities. Unexpectedly, the goods from the producing areas are now exhausted, transportation is difficult, and prices in the producing areas are high, leading to a sharp reduction in supply. At the same time, Shanghai's reserves are low, and your industry and the hoarders are vigorously releasing prices to absorb supply. Therefore, although the joint meeting on the 5th of this month decided to raise the limit by one yuan, it was still impossible to control the situation. This is your association's fault. Our industry has worked hard for years, selling rice at the door and striving to fulfill our obligations. We can say without shame that we have done our best. However, your letter in the newspaper suddenly blamed us. In order to clarify the truth, we cannot remain silent. We hope that your association will not blame others with empty words to deceive the public, and should eliminate the chaotic conspiracy and restrain yourselves properly, so that we can have hope of returning rice prices to normal. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association, from Nanchang Rice Store, Hengshengong Rice Store, Yuchang Rice Store, Xinyixing Rice Store, Wufengtai Rice Store, Fuchang Rice Store, Dachang Rice Store, Sanyang Rice Store, Xinshenghe Rice Store, and others.</p>
<p>The Overall Food Supply is Temporarily Assured</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the market that the cause of the soaring rice prices was indeed the manipulation by hoarders. However, the Shanghai Concession has been under martial law, causing citizens to rush to buy rice. The business of rice stores has doubled in recent days, and the market is having difficulty keeping up. The price of top-grade white rice has actually risen to 17.70 yuan per shi. This phenomenon is indeed unfortunate for Shanghai. However, the recent national rice shipments to Shanghai have not been interrupted. Although they are less than before, this is a phenomenon that is inevitable during the transition between harvests. There are still abundant reserves, so the overall food supply is temporarily assured.</p>
<p>Wuhu Relaxes Restrictions; Indica Rice is Sufficient</p>
<p>After rice industry groups worked hard to find sources, the ban on rice leaving Wuhu has been lifted after negotiations with rice merchants. However, Wuxi and other places still ban the export of white rice. Therefore, Shanghai has recently experienced an unusual shortage of japonica rice. Indica rice is still considered sufficient. In the future, the prices of indica rice and japonica rice will diverge, and japonica rice may become like glutinous rice in the current market.</p>
<h3>The Da Mei Newspaper Requests to File a Protest</h3>
<p>Since the American-owned Da Mei Newspaper had its license revoked by the Public Works Department, the newspaper has continued to publish as usual to protest, in addition to requesting the American consul to file a protest. Yesterday, the police prevented the newspaper from being distributed, but the newspaper is determined to continue the struggle to wait for a reasonable and proper resolution.</p>
<h3>The Value of the Japanese Yen is Lower Than the Legal Tender; This Morning, Exchange Shops Bought One Japanese Yen for 98.3 Fen of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>--The Japanese Side is Working Hard to Find Ways to Support It--</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that a Chinese exchange shop on Sichuan Road bought one Japanese yen for 98.3 fen of legal tender this morning (the 19th) and sold it for 98.7 fen. The exchange rate for Bank of Korea banknotes is even lower. The Japanese authorities in Shanghai are urging the Japanese here to conserve their resources in order to support the weakening Japanese yen, and will also work to</p>
<p>Prevent the Japanese Yen</p>
<p>from flowing into the south bank of the Suzhou River in large quantities. According to Japanese authorities, the large-scale southward flow of the Japanese yen is a secondary cause of the weakening of the yen in Shanghai. In addition, measures will be taken to limit the number of Japanese tourists to Shanghai and to strictly supervise ships and other means of transport to prevent the Japanese yen from being transported to Shanghai from North China and Manchuria. Mr. So-and-so, an official from the Japanese Ministry of Finance stationed in Shanghai, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan tomorrow (the 20th) to discuss</p>
<p>the measures to be taken in the future</p>
<p>with government officials. It is reported that the East Asia Institute's Central China Liaison Office, the Japanese Resident Financial Affairs Commissioner's Office in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Office of the Bank of Japan are currently working together to implement the necessary measures, and the East Asia Institute will also formally hold a frugality campaign among Japanese personnel, ordering them to avoid holding banquets and other entertainment at this time. According to the Japanese-language Continental New Daily, the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai and the Consulate General will also respond and intend to encourage savings and remittances back to Japan.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession Holds the "Traffic Safety First" Campaign; The Police Department Invited All Relevant Parties to Form a Committee to Draft a Plan Which Has Been Approved</h3>
<p>The first decision-making meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Committee for this year was held on the 15th of this month. Mr. Kai Ziwei was elected as the chairman, and a number of major cases were resolved. There was a detailed decision on the propaganda week for the "Safety First" campaign. The Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police reported to the authorities that the congested situation this year is a matter of concern in terms of traffic safety. Therefore, it is planned to hold the "Traffic Safety First" campaign. This proposal has been approved by the Board of Directors in principle, but the authorities cannot bear the huge costs. Any expenses must be approved by the Board of Directors. In this regard, the Assistant Chief of the Police Department, Baker, invited representatives from all relevant parties to a meeting, and the representatives formed a committee to start investigating and drafting the campaign plan. At the beginning of the investigation, the committee asked the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors to allocate 2,000 yuan first, and a detailed budget would be reported separately. The Board of Directors immediately replied, approving the allocation of 1,000 yuan first, and would consider it further when the committee made another report. On the 15th of this month, the secretary of the Safety First Campaign Preparatory Committee sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council with the proposed plan and expenditure budget. According to the sections listed in the budget, this campaign would require 7,782.5 yuan if held within a limited scope. If the scope is expanded, the committee believes that 10,000 yuan would be needed. The committee asked the authorities to reply by letter, whether the proposed plan could be agreed to, whether all departments of the Shanghai Municipal Council could enthusiastically cooperate, whether the required funds could be fully borne by the authorities, or whether a partial subsidy could be given. If only a partial subsidy is given, could the authorities approve the request for subsidies from various public utility companies, major merchants, and the French Concession Public Works Bureau? Regarding this matter, in addition to the fact that all departments of the Shanghai Municipal Council have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the committee, the Police Committee has reconsidered it in detail. The committee members expressed the opinion that this campaign would be welcomed by the majority of residents and would have real value. Although the estimated expenditure of 10,000 yuan is a large amount, it may in fact be necessary. Public transportation companies and insurance companies should be happy to assist due to the value of this campaign. However, since this plan is designed for the public good, the burden on private merchants should not be too heavy. The committee then resolved to recommend to the Board of Directors that the plan proposed by the Safety First Campaign Committee should be approved in principle, with slight modifications to the plan proposed by the Police Department. All departments of the Shanghai Municipal Council should cooperate as much as possible in the Safety First campaign. The proposal to request subsidies should be approved. As for the funds allocated by the authorities, it should be guaranteed to be equal to the amount of subsidies received from other sources, but should not exceed 5,000 yuan. All of the above recommendations have been approved by the Board of Directors. The propaganda outline proposed by the Traffic Safety First Campaign Propaganda Committee is translated below:</p>
<h3>Traffic Safety First Campaign Propaganda Committee Report</h3>
<p>The members of this committee have attended the previous decision-making meetings of the preparatory committee and have held multiple meetings to discuss the facilities and recommendations of other subcommittees. Since April 11, this committee has been publicizing in newspapers, asking newspapers to publish slogans about putting safety first when walking, and to draw pictures, published once every three days. This method of publicity will be intensified in the future, until the start of "Avoid Disasters" Week. Various newspapers in Chinese, English, and Russian have set aside space to publish the propaganda text of this committee free of charge. This committee has also sent letters to the editors of various newspapers to promote the campaign. All plans of this committee, now and in the future, will be sent to various newspapers at any time. The most important task of this committee is to contact other subcommittees, prepare a definite plan, and compile an expense budget. Before "Avoid Disasters" Week, this committee intends to hold a publicity campaign that is not related to the safety campaign itself. "Avoid Disasters" Week is scheduled for June 4 (Sunday) to June 10 (Saturday). During this week, this committee intends to invite all public utility companies, transportation companies, private car owners, taxi owners, bicycle shops, rickshaw shops, and vehicle authorities in the two concessions to cooperate in avoiding vehicle accidents and to find ways to make all vehicles and pedestrians be extra careful to seek safety. The intention of this campaign is to lay the foundation for improving the situation in the two concessions and to gradually reduce accidents. This meeting resolved to adopt the opinions of various subcommittees and use the following methods to carry out publicity for pedestrians and vehicles.</p>
<h3>Propaganda Outline</h3>
<p>I. Pedestrians</p>
<p>Hire hundreds of storytellers to tell stories in lively places to the general uneducated classes, explaining that walking should be alert and cautious, etc. At the same time, dispatch many older Boy Scouts (not in uniform) to distribute leaflets with concise text explaining the main points of this committee.</p>
<p>For the general educated population, post notices in shops, bars, teahouses, public halls, and various vehicles, and use the broadcast network composed of 40 Chinese commercial radio stations to widely disseminate the message. On one hand, patrol police from various police stations will do their best to guide pedestrians to walk on the sidewalks and instruct them on how to cross intersections with traffic lights and traffic police.</p>
<p>In the more lively sections of major roads, older Boy Scouts will hold flags with Chinese slogans, advising pedestrians not to leave the sidewalks, not to linger, and not to be reckless. Major stores and department stores are requested to cooperate to the best of their ability. Insert texts warning the audience not to be reckless when walking into the programs of cinemas and entertainment venues. Other various publicity methods are listed in the following sections, and the purpose is to advise the public to strive for traffic safety.</p>
<p>II. Students</p>
<p>Each day, teachers will teach students of all grades in each school a short lesson on road safety. The cooperation of the education departments of the two concessions is requested for this work. Short essay contests will also be held in schools. After the principals have evaluated the essays, this committee will give a small number of prizes.</p>
<p>For foreign schools, this committee believes that teachers can prepare short lessons. Each teacher will be able to explain the facts about various aspects of traffic hazards clearly in five days. The necessary information will be provided by the Traffic Department.</p>
<p>For Chinese schools, the authorities of the two concessions should be able to expand the existing lecture courses. During the campaign week, lecturers will give lectures every day. If this method is not possible, then the necessary information will be provided to Chinese teachers. The Education Department will handle the schools under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Teachers in each school will distribute buttons printed with the words "Safety First" to each student to attract the attention of students' parents and nannies and to make this campaign popular. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Police Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The first decision-making meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Committee for this year was held on the 15th of this month. Mr. Kai Ziwei was elected as the chairman, and a number of major cases were resolved as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Children's Protection Division Case The Board of Directors of the American Social Hall sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating that in order to participate in the work of rescuing impoverished children, the Hall intends to hire a social work officer to serve under the direction of the Shanghai Municipal Council Children's Protection Division for at least one year. If the proposed plan is effective, it will be extended. The funds required for the officer's salary and other administrative expenses this year have been raised by the Hall for 2,000 yuan, etc. The Police Committee resolved to request the authorities to approve the method proposed by the Hall. The committee members said that according to the facts listed by the Children's Protection Division last month, how to protect children who are separated from their biological parents and abused by others is a major issue. It would be of great benefit to increase the number of officers handling protection affairs. The authorities should direct the officer recommended by the Hall on the one hand and closely contact the Hall on the other hand for cooperation. This recommendation has been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>(2) Tavern License Case In October of last year, someone proposed to establish a tavern at 681 Sichuan Road and applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council for a license. The Navy Youth Association, with the support of the American Consul General, protested, and the Shanghai Municipal Council did not allow the tavern to be opened there. The petitioner now intends to open a tavern on the side of the same building along Suzhou Road. The Navy Youth Association has again expressed opposition with the support of the American Consul General. At the same time, someone else proposed to open a tavern at 625 Sichuan Road, which is opposite the Navy Youth Association, and applied for a temporary license. The authorities believed that once this case was announced, it would be opposed, so the two cases were submitted to the Police Committee for review. The Navy Youth Association believes that if there are places selling alcohol near the association, it will be detrimental to its affairs. The American Consul General also agreed. In view of these opinions, the Police Committee believed that there were reasons, and there were already places selling alcohol in the Sichuan Road area, so it resolved to request the Board of Directors to approve the request of the Navy Youth Association to refuse to issue the license. This recommendation was approved by the Board of Directors.</p>

<h3>At the Request of the Japanese Side, the Police Department Arrested Chinese Lu Cishan; Accused of Being Involved with Guerrillas; Suspicious Advertisements Appeared in Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that yesterday (the 18th) it was learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, at the request of the Japanese authorities, sent detectives to arrest Chinese Lu Jueshan (transliteration) at 4:00 pm on Sunday. Lu lives at 227 Qipulu and is said to be a wealthy landowner. He is now detained at the Fuzhou Road Police Station. It is reported that Lu was arrested because he was accused of being</p>
<p>Involved in Guerrilla</p>
<p>Activities. However, when he was interrogated in the past four days, he did not admit to having any political connections. This case is quite mysterious, because last week, an advertisement appeared in the local Japanese-language Continental New Daily, inviting one Japanese assistant. Applicants could dial a certain number. The</p>
<p>Telephone Number</p>
<p>was Lu's residence. Many Japanese people dialed the number to apply. Mr. Lu did not admit to publishing the advertisement and finally complained to the telephone company, saying that he received an increasing number of calls that were not intended for him, causing him great annoyance. The authorities are continuing to investigate this case.</p>
<h3>In Order to Raise Funds for Silkworm Cocoons, the Puppet Regime Still Intends to Implement Control; Manufacturers Do Not Cooperate</h3>
<p>Spring cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are gradually entering the market. The Zhejiang Provincial Oil Tea Cotton and Silk Management Office, in order to support cocoon merchants and help silkworm farmers, has specially loaned 1.5 million yuan for silkworm cocoons, to the extent of the full loan amount, and has formulated loan methods and procedures, ordering cocoon merchants in various counties to organize cocoon collection groups to avoid unnecessary competition. All cocoon merchants who want to purchase silkworm cocoons in Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Shaoxing, Shengxian, Xinchang, Shangyu, Lanxi, and Fuyang Naxiang and other places, but lack funds, should apply for loans directly to the relevant silk cocoon offices in accordance with the prescribed methods and procedures. They must provide 20% cash in advance, obtain a guarantee from a well-established merchant, and submit a loan application to the silk cocoon department of the relevant office. After the application is approved by the office, a loan approval notice will be issued, and the borrower can use this notice to go directly to the silk cocoon department of the office to sign a contract and withdraw funds, etc. The monthly interest rate for this loan is set at 9% for ordinary cocoon merchants and reduced to 7% for cooperative unions.</p>
<p>Puppet Regime Control</p>
<p>Because last year's control plan failed, the puppet organization is only controlling one district in Jiangsu this year. A notice was issued by the puppet "Jiangsu Construction Department" stating that all those who want to purchase spring cocoons in the occupied areas of Jiangsu Province must register before May 20, and a security deposit of 3 yuan per market dan of dried cocoons must be paid, with each stove calculated at 15 market dan. However, only three days before the deadline, the number of manufacturers going to register and purchase was very small. The cocoon trading volume has decreased significantly compared to the past.</p>
<p>Burning Down Cocoon Factories</p>
<p>Silkworm silk from Zhejiang Province is the only sideline occupation in rural areas, so its output is the highest in the country. Since the areas along the railways and highways were occupied, most of the cocoon factories and houses were destroyed by artillery fire, and very few remain. Because the Chinese guerrillas were afraid that the silk cocoons in the occupied areas would be controlled and purchased and used by others, they recently burned down all the remaining cocoon factories and cocoon stoves in Fengshi Temple, Changan, and other places. It will be difficult to rebuild them in the near future. This year's spring cocoons will thus make it impossible for the villagers to sell them and they will have to reel them themselves.</p>
<h3>Japanese Customs Tax Office Announces Restrictions on Navigation and Customs Clearance; No Clearance Without Japanese Military Permit; Foreign Merchants Again Suffer Illegal Restraints From Fetal Spirits</h3>

<h3>Resuming Navigation in Fujian Sea: Xinjiang Steamer to Quanzhou, Lisheng Steamer to Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Due to the presence of over twenty Japanese warships and frequent bombing raids by Japanese aircraft on Fuzhou and Quanzhou, the maritime situation in Fujian Province had been tense. According to reports from the shipping industry, a portion of the Japanese warships has departed, but three Japanese warships remain anchored outside the Min River estuary, and Japanese aircraft continue to conduct reconnaissance flights. The coastal situation is now relatively peaceful, and the public is calm. The Shanghai Navigation Bureau temporarily prohibited navigation to Quanzhou for defense purposes. However, a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency has learned from the shipping industry that the situation has eased, and the industry has received approval from the authorities to resume navigation to alleviate passenger and cargo congestion. The British Xinjiang Steamer is scheduled to be the first to sail to Quanzhou on the 23rd to resume navigation. The British Jardine Matheson's Lisheng Steamer is scheduled to sail to Fuzhou on the 19th, but this trip will not stop at Xinghua Bay.</p>
<h3>Two US Gunboats Scheduled for Scrapping</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland Press, it was learned yesterday (the 18th) that the British 645-ton gunboats HMS Cricket and HMS Mantis, which have served in Chinese rivers for nearly twenty years, are scheduled to be sold for scrap next month. They will be replaced by new-style gunboats HMS Dragonfly and HMS Grasshopper. The two new ships are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in mid-June. It is expected that the Grasshopper has already arrived in Hong Kong today (the 19th, or tomorrow). The Dragonfly should also arrive in Hong Kong, stay for two weeks, and the troop transport ship HMS Dunera is also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in mid-June, bringing 200 replacement officers and soldiers.</p>
<h3>British Warship HMS Dorsetshire Suddenly Leaves Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland Press, the British cruiser HMS Dorsetshire, which had been docked in Shanghai for several weeks, suddenly weighed anchor and sailed to Hong Kong at 2:30 PM yesterday. British naval authorities did not announce the ship's departure in advance, only stating that its southward voyage was a "routine operation." The US coastal defense ship USS Tulsa is scheduled to weigh anchor and sail to the South China Sea at noon today. This ship arrived from Qinhuangdao last week and was originally scheduled to sail to Fuzhou, but the plan was canceled due to reports of mines drifting into the sea in the Min River.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Order to Reject "Hua Hsing Bank" Banknotes: Strictly Adhere to Stance, Avoid Dealings, Isolate to Reduce Harm</h3>
<p>Regarding the issuance of banknotes by the "Hua Hsing Bank," the Ministry of Finance has issued an order to all provinces, cities, and industries to uniformly reject their use and avoid dealings. The original order stated that the "Hua Hsing Bank" was reportedly officially established at the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai on May 1st, with a capital of 50 million yuan, half borne by the "Reformed Government" and half by six Japanese banks. It was also decided to issue banknotes in denominations of ten yuan, five yuan, one yuan, two jiao, and one jiao. This kind of bank with fictitious capital and indiscriminate issuance of banknotes aims to undermine China's financial system, disrupt monetary policy, and achieve its ambition of monopolizing East Asia and excluding foreign interests in China. The establishment of the "Joint Reserve Bank of North China" and the issuance of unprepared banknotes were previously denounced by the Ministry as a poisonous scheme, and propaganda was disseminated to the people in the guerrilla areas. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also requested to inform the embassies of various countries in China, asking them to notify overseas merchants to uniformly reject the use of these banknotes and instruct the national financial industry to strictly adhere to its stance, refuse to use the banknotes, and avoid dealings. Now that the market value of these banknotes in North China is declining daily, the so-called "Hua Hsing Bank" has been established in Shanghai and empty banknotes are being issued, further demonstrating its deceptive tricks. All in the financial industry and other industries should strictly adhere to the position, uniformly reject the use of the banknotes and any notes, and absolutely do not associate, so that the bank is isolated in order to reduce the harm and maintain our legitimate rights. In addition to issuing orders for compliance, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to submit a note to the embassies of various countries, asking for unanimous rejection. It is hoped that everyone will follow the instructions. Seal of the Ministry of Finance in Jiangyu.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Gradually Becoming Quiet: Japanese Warships Shell Zhenhai Twice, Shaoxing Bombed by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Since Ningbo was bombed for the eighth time on the 10th, there have been no Japanese air raids since the 15th. However, on the 15th and 17th, Japanese warships shelled the Zhenhai Fortress from the waters off Qiliyu and Ligang outside Zhenhai Port. The Japanese warships then withdrew, and the garrison did not retaliate, suffering no losses.</p>
<p>Evacuation of Population</p>
<p>The Yin County government, fearing that rural villagers might raise rents for urban residents evacuating to the countryside, specifically ordered township offices and police stations to supervise and maintain order, and prohibited soliciting donations or conscripting soldiers from them.</p>
<p>Post-Disaster Relief</p>
<p>In terms of relief and rehabilitation, all sectors of Ningbo are actively working on it. In terms of funds, the National Relief Commission has allocated funds for relief. The Ningbo Native Place Association is now working hard to urgently raise funds for relief, and the situation is quite enthusiastic. When the time comes, the results will exceed the predetermined amount of 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Property</p>
<p>It is also learned that when Ningbo was brutally bombed by Japanese aircraft for the fifth time on the 9th of this month, a bomb that fell in the Fayuan Lane hit the roof of the British Baptist Church, a foreign property marked with the British flag emblem, causing significant damage.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Bombed</p>
<p>According to refugees arriving in Shanghai from Shaoxing, at 8:40 AM on the 3rd, five Japanese seaplanes flew into the county airspace from the Longshan area north of the town, circling at low altitude for reconnaissance, and then recklessly bombed. The bombing lasted for about an hour before returning along the original route. A total of fourteen bombs were dropped. Shaoxing Middle School and its affiliated primary school, the Shaoxing Chamber of Commerce, the commercial district of Dama Road, the residential area of Duanhetou Yuechifang, and the Shaoxing Relief Center were all hit by bombs. The Special Commissioner's Office and the Shaoxing County Government were also hit, destroying several houses. The commercial district of Dama Road also caught fire, which burned until 1:00 PM, destroying more than eighty houses and causing nearly a hundred casualties. The Chamber of Commerce building was bombed and collapsed, killing a staff member named Chen. Five or six policemen were also injured.</p>

<h3>Tragic Car Accident in Hongkou: British Police Court Opens Trial, Coroner Haines Details the Events, Five Witnesses Describe What They Saw</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the case of Mr. Lilley, Principal of the Lester Institute of Technology, who died in a car accident involving a Japanese public bus near Broadway and Minghang Road at just after 9:00 PM on April 24th, was continued yesterday (the 18th) by British Police Court Coroner Haines. After the five witnesses testified, the case was adjourned until 2:15 PM on Monday, when Mrs. Lilley is expected to testify.</p>
<p>Representing Japan</p>
<p>Several officers from the Naval Landing Forces also attended the court yesterday, and two Japanese recorded the testimony. The first two witnesses were Knowles, Detective Chief of the Criminal Division of the Central Police Station, who took seven photographs at the scene of the accident at 10:00 PM on the 24th, and Turner, a trainee officer from the Traffic Division of the Central Police Station, who personally drew a diagram on Broadway and Minghang Road on the evening, clearly showing the positions of the two vehicles. The next witness was Abellansky, a Western Constable from the Hongkou Police Station, who told the coroner that at 9:12 PM on the 24th, he accompanied Chinese Detective No. 33 to</p>
<p>Broadway</p>
<p>Near Minghang Road, where he saw two foreign men on stretchers next to a fire truck, and a Western woman with a bloody face. At the scene, there was a car with license plate number 5593 and a Japanese public bus with license plate number 814. The two vehicles were three hundred yards east of the corner of Minghang Road. The public bus was facing east, and the car was facing west. At that time, he collected information at the scene and made brief notes, but was obstructed by the Japanese marines. He then asked the Chinese detective to report to the Hongkou Police Station and directed the ambulance driver to take the injured to the hospital. He saw that a Chinese</p>
<p>Female Ticket Seller</p>
<p>Was approaching in the public bus, her face was bleeding. He ordered her and three others to enter the ambulance together. When they arrived at the Country Hospital, the two men were treated by Dr. Patrick, Mrs. Lilley was sent upstairs, and the Chinese woman was transferred to Renji Hospital. Western Constable A. continued that the road was wet and slippery at the time. In response to questioning from Mrs. Lilley's lawyer, Mr. Maestre, Mr. A. said that a Western woman ran towards A. from the stretcher, shouting that her husband was dead, and told A. that her name was Lilley. A. continued that he then noticed that one of the two people on the stretcher was a police officer, and upon closer inspection, he found that it was Western Constable Wimsett, dressed in plain clothes. He did not recognize the</p>
<p>Western Man</p>
<p>Corporal McDonald of the West Yorkshire Regiment then stated that at 8:40 PM on the 24th, he was on duty at the Garden Bridge. At about that time, he saw a Ford car driving from the north and stopping in front of the police booth on the Garden Bridge. He saw that the front right lights of the car were damaged. A British man and woman got out of the car and reported to the Western Constable of the local police station that an accident had occurred. The British woman showed the damaged part of the car to the Western Constable and asked him to accompany her to show the location of the accident. The Western Constable then got into the back of the car, which was driven by the man, and drove across the bridge into the Japanese-controlled area.</p>
<p>About Half an Hour</p>
<p>Later, a foreigner living at 1006 Avenue Joffre reported to him that there was a car accident, with four or five Americans involved. British soldier McDonald then told the Japanese police officers on duty on the bridge to inform the Japanese marines. McDonald, with the help of two Chinese constables, telephoned the Central Police Station to report the accident. The Chinese female ticket seller of the public bus, who lived opposite the Shanghai Yarn Factory on Guangxin Road, sat among the Japanese officers who attended the court. It was said that the public bus was owned by the China-Japan Joint Venture Huazhong Company. Coroner Haines asked if the public bus had had an accident last month. No. Mr. Haines asked, "Never?" Answer: "I don't know."</p>
<p>Mr. Haines then Asked</p>
<p>Her whether she was injured last month, and how she was injured. She replied that it was due to a collision between two vehicles. She also said that a month ago, a foreign car collided with a public bus near Broadway and Minghang Road. The public bus was driven by a Chinese. She was in the back of the car selling tickets when she was injured and did not see anything. The Coroner said, "I am not asking what you saw, but what happened to you." She replied, "I don't know." The Coroner then asked, "How did you know you were injured?" The female ticket seller replied that she lost consciousness after the two vehicles collided. The Coroner then said to the interpreter, "Tell this witness that she was very detailed in her account to the police officers</p>
<p>And Seems to Have Forgotten Now?"</p>
<p>The female ticket seller replied that she did not know what she told the police officers. She only regained consciousness after being carried to the hospital. She also said that she did not see the public bus collide. The public bus departed from the Garden Bridge and drove along Broadway at a speed of slightly over 25 miles per hour. Mr. Haines asked, "How could she estimate the speed?" She replied that this was the maximum speed stipulated by the company and that the car seemed to be driving quite slowly at the time. Thereupon, the Coroner dismissed the court until Monday for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Leaflets Discovered at the Rising Sun Building on Nanjing Road, Distributor Escaped Immediately</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland Press, at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 18th), Nanjing Road was crowded with traffic when a Chinese man suddenly threw a bundle of leaflets on the sidewalk near the Sincere Company and fled from the crowd.

<h3>Old Clerk Injured on Duty and Disabled: Rice Shop Owner Accused of Pursuing Profits and Disregarding the Body of an Employee, Not Providing Medical Treatment or Abandoning After Injury on Duty</h3>
<p>Zhao Xuesheng, a native of Jiading and an old clerk at the Santai Rice Shop at 48-50 Route Aieglée, French Concession, is currently being treated for crush injuries and disability at the First Refugee Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross at 476 Route Haig.

On the afternoon of August 12th last year, another forty bags of yellow soybeans were imported. Disregarding the danger, the defendants forced the victim, i.e. the plaintiff, to pile up the goods, causing the rice to collapse and causing the plaintiff to be</p>
<p>Heavily Injured</p>
<p>He was first sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Because the defendants learned that the medical expenses were huge, they sent someone to lure the plaintiff out of the hospital and sent him to Shi Xiaoshan for treatment. Since it was inconvenient to live in the store, they ordered him to stay in a inn and then abandoned him. The plaintiff, unable to afford the board and lodging at the inn, was forced to return to the store. The defendants then sent someone to carry the plaintiff to the mouth of Xishanglin Street, Wuhu Road, and placed him on the ground, ignoring him and leaving. He was sent to Renji Hospital by the police station. Because the injury was not treated for a long time, he became disabled, and was transferred to the First Refugee Hospital. The defendants are</p>
<p>Intentionally Cruel</p>
<p>And have not cared, so he requested an investigation in accordance with the law. Upon receiving the complaint, the court held a hearing yesterday afternoon with Judge Liao Yuan presiding. The plaintiff was unable to appear in court at the hospital because he was disabled. The attorney representing the plaintiff attended the hearing and described the circumstances of the injury and abandonment. The defendants also attended with their defense attorneys. After a detailed hearing in court, the court ordered a postponement for investigation and retrial.</p>

<h3>The British Consulate Must Thoroughly Investigate the International Evening News, Rumored to be Related to the Wang Faction</h3>
<p>Huguang News reported that the British-owned International Evening News has been suspended for more than five months, and it has been rumored several times that it will be resumed, but there has been no follow-up. Recently, it was rumored that it would be restored this month.

According to reporters, the publisher of the evening paper, Krumpke, has received a notice from the consulate to postpone the resumption of publication and to wait for a thorough investigation before approving it. The editor Wang Tianhen also resigned because the newspaper was rumored to be related to the "Zai Faction." The resumption of the International Evening News is still pending.</p>

<h3>Tiangong Woolen Blankets are Sold at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Woolen blankets are necessities for household use. In the past, imported goods were quite popular, so the Chinese were inspired to set up factories to manufacture them themselves. There are no less than a dozen such factories established in this city. In addition to local sales, large quantities are shipped to the South Sea Islands. However, due to the frequent rise in yarn prices, they are somewhat affected. It is heard that the artistic woolen blankets produced by the Tiangong Factory have been included in the display at the Shanghai New Market National Product Exhibition on Jingansi Road, and a retail department has been set up to sell them at low prices in order to promote them.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the report in the "Local News" section of your newspaper on the 13th of this month, titled "Post-War New Factories Surge, Cotton Mills Congregate in Shanghai—A First-Hand Account," which stated that among British-owned yarn mills, only Ewo Mills produces yarn, and that the yarn it produces is insufficient for the other three mills to weave cloth, and that it is necessary to purchase yarn from Chinese and Japanese mills, we would like to clarify that our company, including Ewo, Yangtszepoo, and Ewo Cotton Mills, has a total of 170,000 spindles and 3,320 looms. All three mills spin yarn using surplus yarn sold in the market and have never purchased yarn from Chinese or Japanese mills. We request that you correct this to avoid public misunderstanding.</p>

<h3>### Overview of Chinese Secondary Education (I)</h3>
<p>Restricting the Establishment of Middle School Districts, Preventing the Manufacture of Schools, and Prioritizing the Allocation of New Funding to Vocational Teacher Training</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The total number of secondary education schools, teachers, students, and funding before the war, as well as the situation of the national middle schools newly established by the Ministry of Education and the teacher service corps after the war, have been published in this newspaper. The following is a summary of the Ministry of Education's overall system and measures for middle schools over the past ten years:</p>
<p>System Aspect</p>
<p>In the 11th year of the Republic (1922), the new education system implemented a 3-3 system for middle schools and adopted the multi-disciplinary middle school method, allowing the establishment of vocational and normal education departments. The duration of study could be 4-2 or 2-4 years, depending on local conditions. In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the University Council felt that the multi-disciplinary system was difficult to achieve practical results and ordered that normal schools should be established independently in principle. In the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the National Government promulgated the Middle School Law, and at the same time promulgated the Normal School Law and the Vocational School Law, clarifying that the three types of middle schools should be established independently to exert their special functions. The Middle School Law stipulated that middle schools should be divided into junior and senior levels, each with a three-year duration of study. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the Ministry of Education formulated the Middle School Regulations based on this decision and continued to amend them, detailing all the facilities that secondary education should have, and the middle school system was largely prepared. Both junior and senior middle schools in the 3-3 system could be established independently.</p>
<p>Establishment Aspect</p>
<p>Middle schools should be established by provinces or municipalities directly under the central government in principle. Counties and cities may also establish them, but only if there is a need to establish a middle school according to local conditions, and if it does not hinder the facilities for elementary education. Private individuals or groups may also establish middle schools. Since the implementation of the new education system, counties in each province have competed to run junior middle schools, calling for raising the local cultural level, encroaching on local elementary education funding, hindering its development, lowering the required level of secondary education, manufacturing crudely, cultivating a large number of graduates who could not advance to higher education and could not make a living, harming youth, and affecting society more than anything else. The abuse of private middle schools was even more harmful. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Ministry of Education restricted the establishment of ordinary middle schools, ordering county middle schools to gradually change to vocational schools or rural normal schools for adjustment. When the Middle School Law was promulgated, the distinction between counties and cities in running middle schools was determined, which was to attach importance to the status of middle schools and to make them standardized and rationalized. As for private middle schools, the Regulations for Private Schools were promulgated to regulate them, rewarding the good ones and cracking down on the bad ones. After ten years of supervision and rectification, they have largely reached the standard. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the Ministry of Education selected nine excellent middle schools across the country to carry out middle school experimental education, and private schools accounted for four of them, which shows the government's emphasis on both public and private schools.</p>
<p>In the past, the establishment of public and private middle schools in various provinces was often concentrated in a few large cities. Elementary school graduates in the inland areas could not afford secondary education due to long distances and high costs. For the adjustment, the Ministry of Education formulated the Measures for Dividing Middle School Districts in the 27th year of the Republic (1938), ordering each province to divide the province into several middle school districts according to local traffic, population, economy, culture, and existing school conditions. In principle, a middle school district should be established by the province with a combined high and junior middle school, and each county in the district should be equipped with a single or jointly established junior middle school, so that elementary school graduates and junior middle school graduates could attend school nearby. If the locality is underdeveloped and funding is particularly difficult, the province should first establish one or two junior middle schools in a suitable location in the district and slowly establish senior high schools. Private middle schools should also be included in the overall planning of the number of schools in the district. County private middle schools should also be carefully examined, and those with better results should be strengthened, while county middle schools that are not needed and have poor results should be ordered to close or merge in order to achieve practical results.</p>

<h3>### Hong Kong and Macau Principals Provide Relief to Out-of-School Children and Recruit 300 Teachers</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Hong Kong, 19th) The Guangdong Relief Association and principals from Hong Kong and Macau have agreed to provide relief to out-of-school children. Registration will be held in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau from the 22nd to the 30th. The entrance examination will be held on June 3rd, and admission is free. 1,600 teachers have registered, and 300 will be recruited. A lottery will be held this afternoon.</p>
<h3>### Out-of-School Relief Center Establishes Free Elementary Schools: City Divided into Ten Districts; Recruiting Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>Since Ma Xiangbo, Zhang Shouyong, Wu Yunzhai, and Dai Chunfeng generously donated scholarship funds, the work of the Out-of-School Relief Center for Poor Children in this city has progressed smoothly. Recently, the Standing Committee of the center made two resolutions to expand the scope of relief and consolidate the relief fund, and is working hard to implement them. It is reported that starting next semester, the city will be divided into sixteen relief districts, and a free elementary school will be established in each district. Each school will have 200 students, and all expenses will be free of charge. The first district has been named the Model Elementary School, the second district the Founding Elementary School, the third district the Rejuvenation Elementary School, the fourth district the Cooperation Elementary School, the fifth district the Great Harmony Elementary School, the sixth district the Thrift Elementary School, the seventh district the Loyalty Elementary School, the eighth district the Love and Help Elementary School, the ninth district the Faith and Righteousness Elementary School, and the tenth district the Peace Elementary School. In order to gather wisdom and concentrate talent, the center has sent letters to educators and enthusiastic people to serve as members of the preparatory committee and to recruit enthusiastic voluntary teachers, with a slight subsidy. Those who are interested can go to the center's office at No. 519 Pudong Fellow Association on Aidoa Road to obtain an application form and register. It is also learned that the British and Italian Martial Arts Association in this city, in view of the center's efforts to relieve out-of-school children, has initiated fundraising for the center's free elementary school fund.</p>

<h3>The Purpose and Work of the Shanghai Society for the Protection of Animals</h3>
<p>Since humanity's understanding and compassion for the suffering of animals has grown, animal protection societies have been established in countries around the world, gradually evolving from simple to more comprehensive organizations. The term "animals" actually includes all kinds of beasts, birds, and fish, whether domestic or wild. Mistreatment of animals can be intentional, unintentional, due to ignorance, or due to economic factors. This last reason is often seen in China. The initial purpose of these societies is often focused on local conditions. In other words, they try to reduce all kinds of animal abuse that exist locally and provide humane treatment for ownerless wild animals. As the strength of the societies increases, their scope of activities expands greatly.</p>
<p>Based on knowledge gained from past humanitarian endeavors, the methods of operation can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Advocate for legislation regarding the humane slaughter of animals.</p>
<p>2.  Prohibit and regulate animal dissection.</p>
<p>3.  Improve methods of trapping animals and birds.</p>
<p>4.  Protect and assist migrating birds, especially those on the coast. Our predecessor, the Royal Society, will submit a proposal to the League of Nations to prohibit oil-fueled ships from discharging fuel oil within a certain distance of the coast. This is because thousands of seabirds die each year from starvation because their feathers are soaked in oil, preventing them from flying.</p>
<p>5.  Educate the public through appropriate writing and lectures.</p>
<p>6.  Cultivate humanitarian education in children.</p>
<p>7.  Widespread publicity of activities.</p>
<p>This activity is international in nature, and international conferences are convened regularly to exchange opinions and coordinate work. There is also an international publication that has a significant impact. October 4th is known as "Animal Day," and it is celebrated in Europe and America.</p>
<p>The above is about the general activities of animal protection societies. Now, let us briefly describe the activities of the Shanghai Society. The origin of the Shanghai Society is obscure and difficult to trace, but it was founded more than 30 years ago. At that time, the Mixed Court exercised its authority in Shanghai, so the Shanghai Municipal Council formulated some humanitarian regulations and attached them to the market and vehicle license regulations. These regulations were enforced by the Mixed Court, and any fines were paid to the Society. Later, due to the abolition of the Mixed Court, and the fact that Chinese law at that time did not have regulations prohibiting animal cruelty, there were great difficulties in imposing penalties. Therefore, the activities of the Society were delayed for many years, and by 1932, only one senior staff member and about 20 members remained. (For several years, there was no office, no investigators, and no issuance of reports.) In the spring of that year, as a result of the brutality of the war, thousands of animals suffered the pain of displacement, starvation, and harm. Social sympathy extended not only to the displaced refugees but also to the animals that had no way to escape. At that time, the police authorities were unable to address this issue, so an active animal protection society became a practical necessity and was quite active. The Society then engaged in reorganization and innovation, and by 1933, it had made considerable progress and was able to hire a part-time secretary. Since 1932, the Society's membership has increased from 20 to more than 800, and it has been able to hire a full-time secretary and an investigator in uniform. The Society also has an office in the Shanghai Race Club, with rent waived, for which we must thank the club. In addition, Sir Austen, who is enthusiastic about animal protection, donated a rescue vehicle, so that sick and injured animals can be sent directly to veterinary hospitals for treatment, and the Society's investigators can expand the area of investigation. In 1936, the Society's quarterly magazine was born, which has been a great help to the Society's publicity department since its publication. In the past four years, the Shanghai Society has been one of the most active societies of its kind in the world.</p>
<p>The Society's organization transcends national boundaries and is completely open. Our goal is to make it universal and international. At present, the Society's members include people of at least 15 nationalities. For example, Mr. Zhang Jianyun was one of the executive members of the Society before his death. When President Guan Jiongzhi was in Shanghai, he was very enthusiastic about the Society's affairs and was willing to help in every way. The Society is immensely grateful to the above two Chinese gentlemen. The purpose of the Society can be briefly stated as follows: to improve the humane treatment of animals in China, especially in the Shanghai area, and to implement the purpose of education, persuasion, promotion of laws, and rescue of suffering animals within the scope of possibility. Poor economic conditions often lead to a lack of empathy, resulting in indifference to the suffering of animals; therefore, the fact that domestic animals are sacrificed to overwork and neglect is not due to the bad intentions of the owners, but rather to a lack of thoughtfulness, which is a common factor. Because the legal basis is very weak, the Society's work is limited, and it has to rely on persuasion and education of the public to awaken individuals' understanding of animals as a matter of urgency; secondly, it is necessary to clarify the importance of legislation to protect animals. In fact, the purpose of the Society is very simple: to create a solid and flourishing social consciousness that has a compassionate view of the suffering of animals, and then use persuasion to eliminate violent behavior.</p>
<p>Then, some may ask: What work has your Society already done? The Society does not dare to boast too much, saying that the majority of the Society's work is devoted to education, but that work has indeed been effective. There are several decentralized and independent authorities managing this city, and most of the animal suffering that can be stopped depends on the sympathetic action of these authorities. In recent years, the authorities have also implemented many in-depth improvements. The Society cannot claim all the credit for these improvements, but the fact that the authorities are willing to carefully consider the suggestions often made by the Society is enough to prove that the Society has a need to exist. However, the success of several improvements is the result of the public's growing interest in the well-being of animals, and the Society can share some of the glory.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned above that the Society employs an investigator in uniform, whose work is not idle. If anyone does not believe it, the investigator welcomes them to accompany him during his work. The investigator inspects various markets, examines dog kennels and medical schools, monitors the loading and unloading of animals in water and land transportation, and tracks down reports of animal cruelty. He also often has to humanely euthanize incurable stray cats to prevent them from suffering indefinitely. Another task of the Society's investigator is to inspect various animal slaughterhouses, paying close attention to the humane treatment of animals from the time they are sent to the slaughterhouse. He supervises the humane treatment of animals, such as replacing the old and cruel nose rings with ropes on the horns, and providing them with adequate drinking water every month. The investigator also pays attention to the pigs in the transport vehicles and the chickens and ducks in the baskets to see if they are too crowded. Often, by pointing out such violations of the inhumane provisions on the license to the police, fines can be imposed. However, these fines are no longer paid to the Society. The Society often gives small rewards to Chinese police officers who are helpful in such matters.</p>
<p>The Society hopes that recent legislation will include regulations requiring the use of vehicles to transport animals such as sheep and dairy cows. Walking on the roads in the city is a cruel thing, especially in hot weather. The following most obvious example can be removed by punishment, and this matter has been reported in the newspapers, and you must have read it. That is, pig bristles, which everyone knows, can be exchanged for goods. Therefore, the pig herders and butchers, whenever they have pigs in hand, pluck the bristles from the live pigs to increase their meager income. The suffering of the animals from this treatment is beyond imagination. An investigator of the Society, after witnessing such an incident, immediately detained the responsible coolie and charged him with "nuisance." The charge of "nuisance" includes many kinds of crimes, and the Society wanted to know at that time whether such cruel behavior could also be charged with this crime. In time, the case was tried in the local court, and after all kinds of evidence were presented, the judge ruled that it was not accepted. Therefore, the Assistant Legal Officer of the Municipal Council applied to change the accusation to "theft"—stealing the pig bristles, the property of the pig owner. As for the coolie's defense, he said that he had no wages and only relied on plucking bristles for his drinking money. The pig owner immediately refuted his statement in court, saying that the coolie actually had a monthly salary of 14 yuan. Therefore, the judge was able to impose a penalty. The most noteworthy thing afterwards was that, a few days later, the police authorities, without notifying the Society, arrested the same kind of offender and achieved the same result. The Society considers the above matter to be the most important thing, that is, after the penalty was imposed, the investigator did not see the same incident happen again in the city. This was commonplace in the past. Some people say that this is just playing with an ignorant coolie, but it is not a happy thing to obtain practical and valuable results. The above matter proves that if there is a law that can accuse the offender of the crime, the penalty can be effective.</p>
<p>At this point, it must be solemnly stated that the Society is not trying to find offenders and punish them, but rather to use education and persuasion to pull the offenders out of the abyss of ignorance. In many cases, those who commit violent acts are often unaware that they are causing terrible suffering. The greatest underlying cause of such events is undoubtedly the hardship of economic life, and thus the ability to be idealistic is also diminished. But sometimes there are many people who are deliberately violent, and only punishment can make them repent.</p>
<p>There are countless examples proving the need for effective legislation. Those who drive pigs often use long sticks with terrifying sharp hooks as driving tools. These sharp hooks pierce into the ears, nose, skin, and flesh of the pigs, causing cruel suffering, but this is not a legal crime and there is no way to complain. Chickens and ducks are often carried by grasping their wings backwards on their backs, causing the joints to dislocate, causing great pain, but everyone thinks that this is the normal way to carry chickens and ducks, and it is not against the law. Recently, a servant beat a cat to death, but this cat was ownerless and could not be punished. You may still remember the news about "Old Soldier" in the newspaper. Old Soldier was a British military horse left behind by the Shanghai Defense Force, and was transferred into the hands of a sycophant, who forced it to work under terrible and arduous conditions, until it was about to die. In fact, it would be better if it could die, because it could be freed from suffering. Finally, with the donations of hundreds of sympathetic people, funds were raised to find a place of rest for the old horse, to spend its old age; the old horse's improvement in life was given by several benefactors. The old horse's bad owner also kept two donkeys, which were found by the investigator to be working in a state of starvation, emaciation, and festering skin. Therefore, the owner was arrested and sued in court, fined for overworking weak animals. In addition, he was ordered to pay the veterinary hospital's medical expenses and had to let the donkey rest for three weeks. Finally, the owner, because the cost of carrying out the order was too high, sent the two donkeys to the Society and used other methods for transportation. The Society recently discovered an old French army horse that was encountering the same fate and is now trying to rescue it and give it a good place of rest.</p>
<p>The situation of hunting animals for fur in China, if described in detail, is shocking. Unfortunately, because the hunting areas are mostly outside the scope of the Society's activities, there is very little work that can be done; but the public awareness that the Society has been working hard to cultivate will awaken and advocate relevant laws to address this issue. Speaking of fur, the love of European and American ladies for fetal lambskin (this trend has gradually subsided) has caused the price of these furs to soar. The manufacturing method of fetal lambskin is extremely cruel. These furs must be taken from the fetal lamb before the hair has grown fully mature in the mother's body. In order to make the fetal lamb born prematurely, the abdomen of the ewe is beaten on both sides with sticks until the desired effect is achieved. This treatment often leads to the death of the ewe, but the value of the fetal lambskin is very high, and the life and death of the ewe is not worth mentioning. Fetal lambskin was obtained in this way, and Zhejiang Province once made lambs disappear because of it. Later, legislation prohibiting the export of fetal lambskin was proposed and strictly enforced, and the trend began to subside. This result was partly due to the efforts of the Society, but the Shanghai Fur Industry Association was an important organization in prohibiting this matter. It is incomprehensible if women can still wear these furs, thinking about the cruel situation when these furs were made.</p>
<p>The Society has never forgotten to educate children to treat animals kindly, so when at school, we often use essay and speech competitions to instill the doctrine of treating animals kindly. The Society's quarterly magazine has a children's column and is printed with beautiful badges for children to wear. Speaking of children's education, there is a misconception that should be corrected here. The Society knows the terrible nature of mad dogs in this city, so it has never taught children to handle stray cats and dogs.</p>
<p>The above, I think, you all know how the Society promotes various works. However, every work requires expenses, and the Society relies solely on voluntary donations from all walks of life. If you are willing to help this kind of humanitarian work, you can join the Society as a member. The annual membership fee is only 5 yuan in national currency. If you pay 20 yuan in national currency at once, you can become a life member. If you do not intend to join, you are also welcome to make a donation at will. For all membership fees and donations, please transfer the money to the Secretariat of the Shanghai Society for the Protection of Animals at No. 184, Rue Massenet, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shanghai City Construction Before the War</h3>
<p>— Lin Lang</p>
<p>According to the statistics at the end of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company installed 3,322 telephones in western Shanghai, 714 in the extra-territorial road area in northern Shanghai, 45 in the southern Shanghai area, and 33 in the northern Shanghai area.</p>
<p>Land Transportation The land transportation tools in the city area, in terms of public ones, include trams, buses, and long-distance buses. (1) Trams. The tram business is operated by the Chinese-owned Electric Company. There are four tram lines with a total length of 23.24 kilometers, with 54 trams and 27 trailers. The third ring road of the company was divided into two sections before the 17th year of the Republic of China, starting and ending in the Laoximen and Xiaodongmen areas respectively. Passengers had to change trains midway, which was very inconvenient. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works ordered the connection of the rails and changed it to a ring road, which opened to traffic in the second half of the 17th year. The second tram line was also supervised by the Bureau and changed to a ring road in the 22nd year. (2) Buses. The Chinese-owned Bus Company signed a contract with the Municipal Government in the 17th year and obtained the right to operate the bus business in the entire city area. In November of that year, it first opened to traffic in Zhabei. After the "January 28th" Incident, the company suffered heavy losses. Later, it replenished its capital and added vehicles to prepare for a comeback. After the Municipal Government moved to the city center, the company resumed operating buses. As of the summer of the 26th year, there were a total of 34 buses, operating on five lines with a total length of 53.2 kilometers. The bus service in the southern Shanghai area was launched by the Southern Shanghai Bus Company in October of the 17th year. However, the company was poorly managed and announced its closure at the end of the 20th year. In April of the 23rd year, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works continued to operate and expanded the routes to Pudong and the Caohijing area in western Shanghai. As of the summer of the 26th year, there were 45 buses, operating on five lines with a total length of 46.5 kilometers. (3) Long-distance buses. There are six long-distance bus companies operating between Shanghai and neighboring counties: Xihu Long-distance Bus Company, Hutai Long-distance Bus Company, Shanghai-Minhang-Nantao Long-distance Bus Line Transportation Company, Shangsong Long-distance Bus Company, Shangnan Transportation Company, and Shangchuan Transportation Company. The vehicles of the first four companies are all buses. The latter two companies laid steel rails and operated steam locomotives. In recent years, their business has been thriving. As for various vehicles with indefinite routes, as of the end of the 25th year, a total of 106,887 vehicles were registered with the Municipal Bureau of Public Works.</p>
<p>Longhua Airport Longhua Airport is located east of Longhua Town, on the bank of the Huangpu River. The airport covers an area of more than 1,200 acres and is the civilian seaplane airport in Shanghai. After the Municipal Government expanded and constructed it, it was handed over to the Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works for management in November of the 24th year. Successively arranged navigation station equipment, such as the runway for airplanes to take off, which is paved with cement; warehouses for storing airplanes, as well as offices. The take-off and landing of airplanes and the boarding and alighting of passengers are quite convenient. The seaplane wharf and night navigation equipment were also in the process of being equipped, but unfortunately, they became a bubble due to the impact of the war. There are factories of China and Eurasia Airlines in the field. China Airlines' routes depart from Shanghai, south to Guangzhou, north to Peiping, and west to Chengdu and Kunming. The Eurasian Line goes from Shanghai to Zhengzhou, then north to Peiping, south to Guangzhou, and west to Xi'an; then from Xi'an to Kunming or Lanzhou; and between Lanzhou and Peiping, passing through Baotou. According to statistics at the end of the 25th year, the number of flights and passengers at Longhua Airport were highest in October, with 175 flights and 1,200 passengers. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Food Grain The Open Market in Rice Has Become Public, and Prices are Climbing Above the Limit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various sources and He Xia total four or five, ** rounds of buns. The Su Tongkun gang came with three thousand six or seven hundred buns. The city implemented emergency preparedness, all making preparations for purchase. The market situation felt chaotic again. All rice prices broke through the limit price. Over-the-counter transactions have become secretly public. The highest Changbang white rice was openly sold in the market, priced at 17 yuan and 45 cents. Because the open market has already become public, the sampling of Changshu white rice is gradually increasing, and the prices of thick and thin rice are also rising all the way. However, in the evening market, due to the price increase, it appeared to be sluggish again, with a result of increasing by three or five cents, varying. The situation of Du Yangjian and Bu Jian is similar. The customer tip is high with the rice market, but in the future only one or two cents are good. The yuan is still mediocre. The high price is 20 yuan and five cents.</p>
<p>The customer Xian yesterday arrived and sold vigorously. The market presented a more prosperous atmosphere. When the market opened in the morning, it was appropriate for the authorities of the concession to take emergency measures. The shops and retailers were all moved to purchase, and the over-the-counter transactions on the market were immediately cancelled in the various parties' operations. It was informally cancelled. The selling price of Nanjing Dingji Xian was allowed to be full. A selling price of 15 yuan and 7 cents for Wuxian and 15 yuan and 45 cents has not yet been formally agreed. The sellers are all goods of 15 yuan and 12 cents. The decision meter and the gravel meter are all up to 14 yuan, which is two or three cents higher than the previous day. However, in the evening market, the father returned from the hoarding customers, and the new users waited and watched. The market returned to the market. Corner. Wuyuan rice and Hong Kong Yuan rice have been arriving continuously, and yesterday the market was not smooth. The market price fell sharply by two cents. Although there may be a deal for Saigon by order, the sellers still insist on the original market. The morning transaction was very calm. In the afternoon, 500 packages were traded, and the price was 19 yuan and 6 cents.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Ascend Step by Step Flour Needs Increase by Themselves</h3>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current market situation is still brewing. Customer transactions seem to be more active than in the previous two days. The Beiyang Gang is stable with Tianjin Shenhui, and the sporadic demand has increased slightly, but the whole ticket to dissolve it is still difficult to start. The Nanyang Gang is also nervous with the Shantou situation, and the entry is not strong, but the retail transactions on the street are lively. The situation in the concession in this port is becoming more and more tense, and the rice price is rising step by step, and people are inevitably terrified. There is a derivative relationship in the food category, so yesterday the 2nd flour mill still required 4 yuan and 5 and a half cents in cash, and even showed a firm state. The total market transaction continued at around 40,000 packages, and the market remained in the local office.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Wheat is slightly tighter. Since the foreign wheat orders have arrived in Shanghai, the impact on the local wheat has been slight. For example, Jiangbei wheat is only sold for 6 yuan one or two corners, and the factory does not accept it. However, Japanese merchants and North China sales are still called cicadas, and the market has been greatly affected. Yesterday, I heard that the asking price for this wheat was higher, and because the rice price was rising, people were uneasy, and the food seemed to be optimistic. However, the factory customers needed it, and they were all indifferent, and the market presented a local office.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>Since the 9/18 Incident, the shipping industry between this city and the Zhuangzhuang has been monopolized. Therefore, the foreign merchant ships that run to Niuzhuang have also been suspended. There are only irregular ships that run. Yesterday, a British merchant ship loaded 12,000 packages of flour and transported it to Niuzhuang. I heard that the flour was reported and loaded by a certain national merchant. Under the current circumstances, I don't know what kind of relationship the British ship can load this cargo. Today, 14,330 packages of flour will be transported to Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>Finance. Major Investors Observing, Gold Market Steadfast</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold futures market showed no momentum, resulting in a slight increase. Prices fluctuated between 2,128 and 2,129 throughout the day. It is believed that various parties harbor doubts and anxieties about the current market environment, leading major investors to adopt a wait-and-see approach, awaiting a shift in the situation before making decisions. Furthermore, strict security measures in the British and French concessions made cash transfers inconvenient. Therefore, only a small number of short covering transactions enlivened the market, totaling less than 300 taels for the entire day. Gold jewelry prices remained unchanged, customs gold remained stable, while Chinese and English pure gold saw slight increases.</p>
<p>Futures Up Only Two Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) saw a prolonged period of quiet in the market. Trading only commenced at 10:15 AM, with silversmiths buying 50 taels from money changers at 2,130 yuan, 3 yuan higher than the previous close. Soon after, silversmiths sold 50 taels to money changers at the same price as the morning opening. Subsequently, the market turned sluggish again. However, sellers still showed interest. Around 11:00 AM, money changers sold 50 taels to a gold shop at [missing value] yuan, showing a flat and weak trend. Later, silversmiths mutually traded 50 taels at 28 yuan as the midday closing price. In the afternoon, strict security measures in the French Concession, along with similar measures in the British Concession, made physical cash transfers inconvenient. Consequently, major investors remained on the sidelines, and trading became even quieter. Only money changers were seen mutually trading 30 taels at 29 yuan. The market remained stable, and the late closing price remained at 2,129 yuan. The result was a two-yuan increase compared to the previous night's close. The difference for the entire day was only two yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was 2,135 yuan, and the buying price was 2,125 yuan. The current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with little actual business.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remains Stable</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael at silversmiths remained unchanged. Ta Tung Hang still quoted 217 yuan, while Sin Tung Hang quoted 215 yuan for selling and 209 yuan for buying.</p>
<p>English Pure Gold Increases Slightly</p>
<p>London, 18th - English pure gold suddenly increased by half a point, reaching £7 8s 6d per ounce. As a result, the Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash also rose to 1,212.30 yuan. The listed customs gold remained stable at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also increased by 40 cents to 1,207.60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Slightly Tight, Spot Exchange Stable for English and US Currencies, Easier for Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although foreign firms frequently sought to acquire spot exchange, plentiful supply from other sources kept the situation stable and unchanged. Sassoon, a Western firm, even made offers to sell. As for futures, foreign banks were increasingly willing to sell, and the Chinese firm Guohua also suddenly started selling. Although foreign firms (acting for Japanese firms and the Tianjin group) were buying, the position still felt ample, and the situation continued to show a stable to firm trend with active trading. The Hong Kong exchange rate appeared slightly tight and soft because foreign banks' appetite to sell was not very strong.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large bills for both near and far terms narrowed by 0.0625. The New York silver price remained unchanged. London raw gold increased by half a point. The exchange rates for English versus US, Shanghai, and French currencies remained stable. The rates for US versus English, Shanghai, and French currencies were all half. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices for spot exchange at banks were 8 1/4 pence for English currency and 16.0625 yuan for US currency, unchanged from the previous night's close. After the opening, foreign firms first settled spot English currency with HSBC and Banque Belge at 8 1/4 pence. Then, they bought spot US currency from Netherlands Bank and Banque Belge at 16.0625 yuan. Because supply and demand were balanced, there were no changes. Then, HSBC's listed rates were announced, and there was no change. The silver equalization tax was announced at slightly over 2%, calculated as 5.25%. Later, foreign firms settled spot English currency from Sassoon, a Western firm, at 8 1/4 pence. At that time, the Chinese firm Guohua suddenly sold US currency for the current month to Ewo (acting for Japanese firms and the Tianjin group) at 16.0625 yuan. Then, Ewo bought July US currency from Banca Italiana di Sconto at 15.875 yuan. Later, a foreign bank sold July English currency to Banque de l'Indochine at 8.15625 pence. The market trend was stable to firm. Nearing noon, trading in both English and US currencies became scarce. Only Hong Kong exchange was traded, with foreign firm Anda buying from Chinese speculators at a spot price of 55.375 yuan. Later, a Chinese firm strongly bought from Netherlands Bank at a spot price of only 55.25 yuan, showing a softening trend. At the midday close, bank selling prices for spot exchange in English and US currencies were similar to the morning opening. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 55.25 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, foreign firms continued to first settle spot US currency at 16.0625 yuan with Banque Belge. Then, they settled spot English currency at 8 1/4 pence with Netherlands Bank. The situation remained largely unchanged. Later, foreign firms bought current month exchange at 16.03125 yuan from Banque Belge and Macgarity. The situation was also stable. There were no reported transactions for Hong Kong exchange, but the bank selling price remained at 55.25 yuan. At the late close, bank spot prices were 8.08125 pence for English currency and 16.0625 yuan for US currency. The result was that spot prices for both English and US currencies remained stable compared to the previous day's late close. Futures remained stable to firm. The Hong Kong exchange rate tightened by 0.0125.</p>
<h3>Three Major Leaks in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange is limited. Although there is control, the 8-penny exchange rate can still be freely accessed. Thus, it is far from being controlled. Currently, the biggest leaks in consumer goods are foreign wheat, foreign flour, and foreign cotton. It is even more unfortunate that there may be large remittances for foreign rice in the future. In addition, the Shanghai people's extravagant consumption of various foreign goods is even greater than before the war. If you don't believe it, look at the goods displayed in the shops. What's more, there are even bigger leaks. It is regrettable that such precious foreign exchange is being wasted!</p>
<h3>Tianjin English and US Exchange Rates Increase</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 19th - Compared with the previous day, exchange rates increased by 0.0125 for English currency and 0.025 for US currency. The Shanghai exchange was lowered by 2.50 yuan. The opening prices for the morning are listed below.</p>

That is, one yuan of "Joint Reserve Notes" is worth 8.333333333 cents of legal tender.</p>
<p>On the 18th, one yuan of "Joint Reserve Notes" was worth 8.2644628 cents, mistakenly written as 8.244628 cents.</p>

<h3>Japanese and Korean Notes Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, English pure gold increased by half a point, and the English and US exchange rates did not move. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were actively settling accounts, and the supply from foreign banks was smooth, so the market was stable and lacking changes. In the gold futures market, gold shops' buying interest was strong, and the market situation was firm. Later, the supply from money changers was slightly smoother, and the market price fluctuated and softened. In the afternoon, supply and demand were balanced, and trading was scarce. The fluctuations throughout the day were narrow. The need for foreign currencies, English and US gold pounds, increased slightly, and they rose slightly. English and US gold tickets fell slightly due to the easing of forward exchange rates and abundant supply. Hong Kong tickets rose slightly due to the potentially weak exchange rate and tight supply. The demand for French franc tickets was quite strong, and they rose. The supply of Japanese and Korean gold tickets was very smooth, demand was scarce, and they fell quite a bit. The association's transactions did not open. Yesterday's market prices: English gold pounds rose by 10 cents, English gold tickets fell by 1 cent, US gold pounds rose by 5 cents, US gold tickets fell by 3 mills, Hong Kong tickets rose by 3 mills, French franc tickets rose by 50 cents, and all other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>English and Indian Silver Prices Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>London, 18th - In the silver market, India made a few purchases, and the market was stable. After the close, it was stable to firm. Indian and American merchants made some purchases at the listed price, but there was a lack of supply. The large silver bills for both near and far terms narrowed by 0.0625. New York silver cable: Spot remained unchanged. Also, Bombay cable: The Indian silver market was quiet, with both spot and futures falling by one anna.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Hand Goods Sold in Competition, Cotton Yarn Price Drops Intensify, Double Horse and Heavenly Maiden Fall Another Seven Yuan, Chips Suddenly Over Supplied</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is in steep decline, due to the poor environment, weak real demand, and increasingly pessimistic sentiment. Many with inventory are trying to sell their hand goods quickly, while traders are unwilling to buy. The market is increasingly oversupplied, and prices are falling. In the last two days, there has been a sharp drop of ten yuan. The 20-count Double Horse has broken the 420 yuan level. However, it is doubtful whether the resumption of transportation from Eastern Zhejiang will lead to yarn and cloth purchases. In the afternoon, there were very few people at the market, and trading was even more sluggish. Roadblocks set up by the concession authorities were dense. The closing price for Double Horse receipts broke 410 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of current yarn, the market opened in the morning with a bleak atmosphere, poor sentiment, and sluggish trading. Even customers were at a loss. Brokers shouted in the market, asking if there was any business for variable-mark yarn. Yarn shops sent tickets to current goods users, eager to sell. Due to the inconvenience of transportation in the concession, they even transported the yarn to the docks themselves, and were willing to sell at a lower price. The opening price for Double Horse ticketed current goods was 419 yuan, the price for current goods outside the warehouse was 420 yuan, and the receipt price started at 414.5 yuan, later 413 yuan. Shortly after, only Guangbang Wanxing, acting on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, made purchases. Otherwise, there was no activity. The selling trend was very strong, and the market price continued to decline. Some large investors, seeing the poor trend, also remained on the sidelines. Suddenly, the price of Double Horse current goods fell to 417 yuan, and the receipt price was 410 yuan. The afternoon opening was average, with just over 100 bales traded, all by traders. The price of Double Horse current goods fell another yuan to 416.5 yuan, and the receipt price was 409 yuan. It was found that a total of 925 bales were purchased by various gangs. The market price for Double Horse fell by seven yuan, Heavenly Maiden also fell by seven yuan, Double Globe fell by six yuan, and 10-count Special Jincheng fell by two yuan. Today, 290 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Fuzhou, and another 120 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 330 Yunnan 35</p>
<p>Traders 495 Inland 60</p>
<p>Wenzhou 3 Total 923</p>
<p>The market for Japanese yarn is in steep decline, with a tendency to fall sharply, due to the lack of current sales. The closing price for 20-count Moon Lyre yarn was 351 yuan, a drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>The Atmosphere in Northern Cotton Yarn Market is Crazy, Just Like the South</h3>
<p>Shanghai people have not heard from the northern cotton yarn market for a long time. Here is some information about the cotton yarn situation in Tianjin brought by a friend. Although it is from the previous day, it is valuable in this situation.</p>
<p>(1) The Tianjin cotton market has been very hot recently, and prices have reached a record high, the highest peak in the history of the North China cotton market. The price of fine lint cotton has risen from over 60 yuan to 77 yuan, which is two yuan higher than the highest price last year. The reasons for the sharp rise are nothing more than short supply, stimulation from yarn prices, and the depreciation of counterfeit currency.</p>
<p>(2) The amount of cotton in each warehouse in the city is only about 80,000 to 90,000 bales. This amount is not enough to supply the cotton mills in Tianjin for three months. Now it is only mid-March in the lunar calendar, and the cotton-growing area is still in the sowing season. It is impossible to predict the bumper harvest or shortage of new cotton this year. Even if a bumper harvest is expected, there is still half a year before the harvest season. In this situation, if the cotton mills have no raw materials to supply during the lean season, they will inevitably stop working. Therefore, in order to consider future work issues, the cotton mills must purchase in the market in advance as a precaution. Therefore, each cotton mill is diligently collecting, and at the same time, general hoarders, seeing that the future is profitable, are entrusting cotton warehouses to purchase on their behalf. Even if the selling price increases, they do not hesitate, only seeking to get the goods. The current goods circulating in the market have been absorbed, and the bottom goods are increasingly scarce, so the market price is like a raging horse galloping.</p>
<p>(3) The source of cotton in Tianjin has always been mainly the Xihe and Yuhe areas. Now the source of the two rivers is still as rare as morning stars. The goods shipped by Yuhe feel very lacking, and all have been searched and exhausted by cotton merchants going to the countryside. Therefore, the arrival of goods is not strong. The cost price of goods stored by inland farmers has increased significantly, and the rising power of cotton prices in Tianjin is stronger. The above reasons all make the cotton market rise. (A)</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Prices Continue to Rise, Manufacturers Temporarily Stop Ordering</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton prices: the New York cotton market is very firm. Although the transaction volume has not increased in recent days, there is a rare shortage of spot goods on the market. There is still no news of the government's loan cotton being released. The new cotton will be launched in August. If the loan cotton is not released in mid-June or July during this lean season, it will create a panic. However, the government is now preparing to release cotton successively when cotton prices rise a certain amount, so that it can also clear a large number of warehouses and replenish the national treasury. Yesterday, New York rose by 9 to 11 pounds, and the April-May white Lok region in India has created a new high price of 172. Egyptian cotton was stable. Converting to legal currency, US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 8 cents per picul, Indian cotton rose by 4 cents, and Egyptian cotton did not move.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, manufacturers both Chinese and foreign have temporarily stopped ordering due to the continuous rise in overseas cotton markets, which has resulted in too high cotton prices. Moreover, a large amount of Japanese foreign cotton has arrived in recent days, and the minds of all traders have also become indifferent. If New York falls back 30 pounds or Indian cotton falls back 10 rupees, the foreign cotton trade can be restored to its previous prosperity. Here are yesterday's market prices for cotton delivered to factories, converted to legal currency.</p>
<p>Raw Material Category Delivery to Factory Including Tax</p>

<p>The domestic cotton raw material market has developed slightly in the last two days, but yesterday it entered a stagnant and dull trend again. Although factories are accepting goods, the goods are scarce and it is very difficult to find them, so the intentions of each factory are uniformly shifted to foreign cotton. However, in recent days, foreign cotton prices have risen daily, and the purchase prices are also expensive. There are very few sources of supply from northern Jiangsu, only 128 bales. Here is the current situation of cotton.</p>
<p>180 bales Cash, warehouse delivery</p>
<p>200 pieces Ditto</p>
<p>300 pieces Ditto</p>
<h3>Securities: Unsettled Situation, Foreign Stock Still Firm, Domestic Debt Market Somewhat Erratic</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation on the securities gray market suddenly suffered a setback due to rumors in the local market. However, because the situation was unclear, people became flustered and cautious, and the short sellers did not dare to increase their positions rashly. The weak market price was still supportable, but the trading was scarce and the fluctuations were even smaller. This kind of brewing situation cannot last for a long time. There will be greater turbulence today. Looking back on yesterday, the selling pressure was initially stronger, and a number of long positions in Tiansheng, Tongkang, Lianhe, and Hengzi, etc. were liquidated, resulting in a decline of 3-4 cents. Later, Runli, Datong, Yongfeng, Tongde, etc. absorbed, and the price rose slightly, only slightly weaker than the previous day. The situation in the afternoon was stable to weak, and trading was very quiet. Both buyers and sellers were very idle. Although there were many rumors, there was no way to confirm them, and the market continued to see small movements. This situation makes people feel that the situation has not become less serious, people are uneasy, and the market price is not easy to rise again. The result was a slight drop of 0.05 to 0.20 yuan, and the total transaction volume was only more than 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category High Low Closing Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified Class A 60.85 60.55 60.80 Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified Class B 53.80 53.60 53.60 Ditto 0.10</p>
<p>Unified Domestic 51.85 51.40 51.80 Ditto 0.10</p>
<p>Unified Class D 51.50 51.30 51.50 Ditto 0.15</p>
<p>Unified Class E 51.85 51.50 51.80 Ditto 0.20</p>
<p>96 6.55 6.0 6.55 Ditto 0.05</p>
<p>There were no transactions in Chinese stocks. According to the report from the public association, foreign stocks were firm due to the improved political situation, but trading still did not seem to be broad. Investors continued to buy tram stocks, with a transaction price of 39 yuan, and Kowheong stocks with a buying price of 197 yuan. The Ruirong stock was stable and did not seem to change, with a price of 7.85 yuan, but the Jaysons stock was slightly weak because the company's interim dividend for 1939 was only 4 yuan, and some people thought it was too small. Telephone stocks were calm after the recent surge, with a price of 99 yuan. Jardine stocks did not fluctuate much, with a closing buying price of 18.70 yuan. Company bonds were trending weakly. The 5.5% electricity bonds had supply and demand at a price of 88 yuan. Rubber stocks were potentially firm and rising, but the difference between the buying price and the selling price was too large, and the transaction volume was extremely small.</p>
<p>The board of directors of the British-owned Jaysons Shipyard (i.e., Old Dockyard) Co., Ltd. decided yesterday to pay an interim dividend of 4 yuan per share in national currency for 1939, which will be distributed at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>The listed prices of the stocks of various Far East companies of the British-owned London on the 18th of this month (Thursday) showed that only the Gula Rong Lin Rubber stock rose by 7 1/2 pence to a price of 18 shillings 9 pence, and the rest did not change.</p>
<p>The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt in London on the 18th of this month (Thursday) showed that only the British debt notes for the Post-War Reconstruction Loan rose by half a pound to a price of 52 1/2 pounds, and the rest did not change. There was a sale of £5,000 in British notes for the Post-War Reconstruction Loan, with a sale price of 53 pounds, half a pound higher than the market price, and £7,000 in Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway public bonds, with a sale price of 19 1/2 pounds, in line with the market price.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Cloth Suffers a Terrible Fall, Domestic Cloth is Quiet in Spot Sales</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot sales in all sectors were uniformly sluggish. The local market was disturbed by rumors, and the weather was not hot enough for summer goods to be at their peak selling season. Therefore, transactions in the market were also sluggish. However, wholesale transactions in Chinese and Western clothing held up well. There were no major rises or falls in prices. Among white goods, the Dahpeng and Fugui fine cloth produced by textile factories such as Yong'an and Shenxin were the most stable. Guangdong and Eastern Zhejiang Wenzhou and Shaoxing gangs bought 40 to 50 packages of specified brands, while fine cloth twill produced by pure weaving factories was affected by the sharp fall in Eastern cloth, and market prices continued to decline. Dyeing factories disliked the high prices and did not use them. Guangdong and Wenzhou gangs bought 50 to 60 pieces, with prices falling by about 10 cents per piece. The Wenzhou and Shaoxing gangs continued to buy nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth/coarse twill. The local market and Wenzhou and Shaoxing gangs continued to buy nearly 100 pieces, with prices continuing to loosen by 5 to 10 cents per piece. Local customers were reluctant to buy bleached and dyed cloth, and only a few transactions were made. The number of dyeing factories in the local market that have stopped work has increased to more than a dozen.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The decline in white goods has not stopped and is moving downstream. Yesterday, the leading fine cloth plunged 30 to 40 cents, selling for 13.05 to 13.10 yuan. Traders replenished their positions in the after market, and the price slowly rose again to 13.40 yuan. Futures for next month traded at 13.45 to 13.50 yuan, and people's hearts began to stabilize slightly. However, colored goods such as serge and zhigong continued to fall, and traders were very panicked. For example, the low price of Four Gentlemen's serge yesterday fell to 0.115 yuan per yard, which is a sharp drop of 8 cents per yard compared to the peak of 0.495 yuan. The difference is 2.40 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 20th, 65 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin, 35 pieces to Yantai, and 25 pieces to Fuzhou. The Linping cocoon market has opened, and transportation costs are quite high.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Silk Turns Downstream, Shanghai Silk Shows No Improvement, Linping Cocoon Market Has Opened, Transportation Costs Are Quite High</h3>
<p>The foreign silk market has turned downstream in the last two days. Yesterday, the US and Japanese markets fell again. Yokohama spot fell by 22 yuan, and futures fell by 19 yuan. New York recently fell by 5 cents, and futures fell by 4.5 cents. Shanghai silk 78 points fell by 4 cents, Japanese silk 83 points fell by 3 cents, and 75 points fell by 4 cents. Local American sales still show no improvement. French silk prices continued to fall by 10 yuan to 20 yuan. The B-character Bai factory traded at 1,780-1,800 yuan yesterday. Only Kelly &amp; Walsh bought 40 bundles. India's Jili silk was traded slightly yesterday, and silk prices were firm, with 10 bundles traded.</p>
<p>According to news from Hangzhou, the cocoon market in the Linping area opened the day before yesterday. However, due to the poor harvest and many difficulties, the price of local fresh cocoons has risen from 40 yuan to 60 yuan, and the price of foreign fresh cocoons has risen from 60 yuan to 80 yuan (both per dan). It is difficult to make the cocoon collection method public. However, based on factual speculation, it seems to be more inconvenient in the occupied areas, and most of the guerrilla areas can set up cocoon collection points. However, transportation still needs someone to arrange it. Generally speaking, the shipping cost of fresh cocoons from the mainland to Shanghai is 40 yuan per dan, including several "taxes" of unknown name and water feet commissions. The silk cocoon market in Suzhou and Wuxi and other towns near the Yangtze River will also open soon. The "China Central Company" can only engage in cocoon collection in the urban area of Wuxi and the two districts in the west of the city. The same is true in Suzhou. In other areas, the guerrillas provide protection, and the information on cocoons has not been suppressed. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line is relatively bad, and because it was impossible to collect cocoons there the year before last, the amount of silkworms raised this spring has been greatly reduced. It is said that in general, there is only 1/10 to 2/10 of the annual yield. The Beijing-Shanghai area has less impact, but it is only about half of the year before last.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Raw Soybean Oil Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's raw soybean oil market continued the good image of the previous day. Tens of thousands of chips in the market have gradually been transferred, and half of the new remaining amount has been hoarded by the multi-head company, so the appetite for trading has been slightly active in the last two days, and the chips are suddenly tightening. Market prices continue to rise. 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil have been traded at a price of 30 yuan, which is 1 yuan higher than the previous day. Dalian barrel raw oil has to rise by 1.5 yuan, and the price is 40 yuan. 40 barrels were traded. Soybean oil has become a compromise. 350 pieces of Yantai oil, 50 pieces of Qingdao oil, 50 pieces of Dalian large baskets, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 300 barrels of Dalian barrel oil, and 30 barrels of Fengnian oil have been traded, and the market prices are generally 0.5 to 1 yuan higher than before.</p>
<p>Today, 880 packages of soybeans were shipped to Xinghua, and 5,600 pieces of bean cakes were also shipped to Xinghua.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Trading Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was quiet because London loosened again, with the cable saying that it fell by 3/4 for August, to 7s 0 1/4 pence; fell by 1/2 for December, to 6s 1 1/2 pence; fell by 3/4 for March of next year, to 6s 2 pence. In the local association's board, 24 coarse white, the current cargo of this warehouse, a little less than half a dime, traded 80 bags at 27.175 yuan; the goods in the outer warehouse were called for a little less than a dime, and transshipment goods were called for 19 yuan; Taikoo car white was also a little less than half a dime; the existing CW marks were withdrawn as usual; Dutch red and local cotton white were all called for the original price, and few transactions were made. National sugar was also weak, and most of the banks went in and out with the market, and the transactions were even rarer. However, according to the news from Guyu, the price of green products has risen. On the 20th, 120 packages of sugar came from Yantai.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: White Lotus Goods on the Way</h3>
<p>White lotus had no source because the Yongou shipping route was cut off. It was found that the stocks on the market were thin, and they had been sold to 110 yuan. Now it has been sold out. According to the letter from the producing area yesterday, the Jinli area was bombed and recently calmed down a little. A small number of goods have been loaded and are on the way and will be transferred to Shanghai from Wenzhou. Now that the Shanghai bottom has been emptied, the market will inevitably continue to increase.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Yantai Dried Scallops, New Goods on the Way</h3>
<p>Yantai dried scallops were sold out early by industry insiders, resulting in a quiet market. Now that the new season is approaching, a message has been received from the producing area that the first batch of goods is being shipped and will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>Metals New Lead Wire Market Also Weak</h3>
<p>The metal trade has been sluggish recently due to slow sales to merchants from various regions, coupled with increasingly tense international and Shanghai situations. Demand for metal products from factories in this area is not as strong as in previous weeks. Consequently, sales of various metal products have weakened slightly. Products like white lead sheet, original factory nails, road sheet iron, flat white iron, yellow steel wire, angle iron, and black iron sheet are all weaker than before. Therefore, the new lead wire market is no exception. Only a few hundred bundles were sold yesterday. Standard prices are as follows: #16 to #20 sold for 35 yuan, #21 to #25 sold for 45 yuan, and single-strand fancy wire sold for 65 yuan. This is a drop of 5 to 10 yuan compared to the previous golden age.</p>
<h3>Coal Indian Coal Sells Immediately Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>Although Indian bituminous coal has been arriving continuously, the city has been short of stock for a long time. Any arriving goods are quickly purchased, leading to a trend of immediate sales upon arrival. Yesterday, a certain firm received over 7,000 tons, and half of it has already been taken by other firms. According to the manifest, Indian standard coal is priced at 39.25 yuan per ton, screened lumps at 41 yuan, and small pieces at 40 yuan. Transferring from the ship reduces the price by 0.50 yuan. Delivery to customers' gates adds 4 yuan to the price.</p>

<h3>Luggage Issues When Traveling by Ship</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Anyone who travels, whether for business or leisure, naturally needs to bring personal belongings. The amount of luggage depends on each individual's preference. Therefore, common modes of transportation, such as airplanes, cars, trains, and ships, have regulations on the amount of luggage allowed to avoid passengers carrying too much. This issue is quite complex. Here are some luggage issues related to ship travel reported to our readers.</p>
<p>Regardless of the shipping company, the amount of luggage passengers can bring for free is determined by their cabin class, level, and distance of travel. These limits vary by shipping company. If the amount of luggage a passenger carries exceeds the limit, the shipping company will charge an excess luggage fee in accordance with the regulations. The fee is very high. While this is generally understood, those with little travel experience may overlook this before boarding and bring large amounts of luggage, even household furniture and unnecessary items. They may find that the excess baggage fee they must pay is even higher than the original value of the items they brought (such as old iron bed frames, wicker baskets, and bulky furniture). At this point, paying the fee according to the shipping company's regulations feels exorbitant, but abandoning the luggage on the spot is impossible, putting them in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>The regulations for free luggage and excess luggage vary depending on the shipping company, especially on the Shanghai to Hong Kong route, where many companies operate ships of various nationalities. Generally speaking, American President Lines and Chang Xing Company allow each first-class passenger 40 cubic feet or 350 pounds of free luggage. Second- and third-class passengers can bring 20-30 cubic feet or 175-250 pounds of free luggage. Exceeding this limit costs US$0.15 per cubic foot or US$0.015 per pound. Luggage is measured by weight or volume, depending on which is greater. Other shipping companies from England, France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands have similar regulations, and their fees are similarly high.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you plan to travel and bring a lot of luggage, it's best to inquire with the shipping company or travel agency beforehand to get an estimate and avoid complications later. Also, shipping companies consider suitcases, briefcases, bedding, and essential travel items as luggage. However, large items such as new statues, pianos, refrigerators, or objects packed with bamboo strips or wooden boards that cannot be opened are considered cargo. When carrying these items, they should be formally declared and shipped, or a "Permit to Ship" should be obtained from customs before sending them to the ship. There are also fees for bringing pets like cats, dogs, and birds, which are quite high. It is important to note that shipping companies have different luggage tags for items to be carried on board (Wanted) and items to be stored in the hold (Not Wanted). Small items needed during the trip can be tagged "Wanted" to be placed in the cabin for easy access. Other bulky and less necessary luggage can be tagged "Not Wanted" and stored in the luggage hold. For the convenience of passengers, the shipping company opens the luggage hold at a specific time each day for passengers to check or retrieve items. Therefore, unnecessary luggage can be stored in the luggage hold to make the cabin more spacious.</p>
<h3>The Latest Eight-Horsepower Austin Model</h3>
<p>To meet global needs, the British Austin Motor Company has recently released a new eight-horsepower Austin model. Its size is similar to the ten-horsepower Austin, but its price is much lower. It is also very fuel-efficient, combining the comfort of the ten-horsepower Austin with the economy of the seven-horsepower Austin. It is reported that Jiuwei Automobile Company at 100 Meyer Xi'ai Road in this city has received a sample six-window four-door sedan of this eight-horsepower Austin model. A large shipment is on its way. It is also reported that the manufacturer has decided to stop producing the original seven-horsepower small Austin.</p>
<h3>Renault Automobile Inventory to Sell Out Soon</h3>
<p>The batch of 1939 Renault small cars recently arrived at Fada Automobile Company at 424 Route Haig. They have been well-received by the automotive industry due to their exquisite design and fuel efficiency, and sales have been excellent. It is reported that the current stock is nearly sold out. The next batch of new cars is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. However, due to cost reasons, the prices will increase slightly. The current inventory will still be sold at the original price to show preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>Travel Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Jingyao asked about the situation of going from Shanghai to Tianjin.</p>
<p>(Answer) 1. All Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships dock at Tanggu, and then take a train to Tianjin. (Passengers in deluxe cabins will be transported by the company's own small steamers). The Xin'anna of Weili Han Company can go directly to Zizhu Lin. 2. Suits and other clothing can be brought, but legal tender is inconvenient. You can exchange it for Japanese gold or prepare banknotes from the Preparatory Bank to bring with you in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Peizhi asked about the situation of going to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(Answer) 1. The lowest fare for ships from Taikoo and Jardine Matheson from Shanghai to Hong Kong is 20 yuan in national currency. The lowest fare for postal ships is 50 yuan. 2. The recent fare from Hong Kong to Kunming via Vietnam is approximately 46 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Jianqiu asked about the situation of going to Fujian and Guangdong:</p>
<p>(Answer) 1. The fare to Hong Kong is 50 yuan in national currency for company ship officer cabins and 20 yuan for steerage. The second-class fare for postal ships is £6 or US$25. The third-class fare is £3 or US$12. There is no problem bringing new clothes to Hong Kong. 2. There are no concessions in Shantou. To go from Shantou to Sanheba, you can first take a train to Chaozhou and then go by road or by small steamship (operated by Chinese merchants). 3. The steamships between Fuzhou and Yanping are also operated by Chinese merchants. 4. There is no problem bringing necessary books to Hong Kong or Fujian.</p>
<p>Messrs. Zhu Fuliang, Lu Yimin, Chen Zhenyu, Yang Ji, He Renlong, and Wang Yiwen asked about the situation in Lishui, Yongkang, and Yiwu in eastern Zhejiang:</p>
<p>(Answer) First take a ship from Shanghai to Wenzhou, and then take a civilian boat to Lishui, which takes two days. Then take a car to Yongkang, which takes three hours. The lowest cost for the entire journey is more than 20 yuan. 2. After arriving in Lishui, you can take a car to Jinhua, which takes five hours. You can also take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway train to Yiwu, or take a highway bus from Yongkang directly. 3. To go to Dongyang, you can go directly from Yongkang. The bus fare is about 4 yuan and takes 6 hours. 4. You must have a local shop guarantee to land in Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Messrs. Wang Jinyu, Yang Yang, Hu Fanzhong, Xu Jilin, Zhu Zuli, and Hu Hanzhang asked about the recent transportation situation to the interior:</p>
<p>(Answer) It is no longer possible to go to the interior through Wenzhou, Yuhua. But for those who want to save travel expenses and avoid going through Vietnam, there are still two routes available, but the journey is very difficult. One is to go through Shantou, then through Chaoyang, Xingning, and Longnan to reach Qujiang. It is said that this section of the highway has been damaged, but it can still be partially passable, costing more than 20 yuan. After arriving in Qujiang, take the Guangdong-Hankou Railway train to Hengyang, and then transfer to the interior. The other is to take a ship from Shanghai to Guangzhou Bay, with a minimum fare of 29 yuan, and then transfer to Yulin (this section of the highway has been interrupted, and passengers mostly travel in groups on foot or by sedan chair instead of cars, which takes more than two days). After arriving in Yulin, you can take the Guangxi Provincial Highway to Liuzhou, and then transfer to Qian and Shu. We do not recommend the above two routes. In short, the safest and most reliable route to the interior is still through Vietnam. This journal has repeatedly detailed the itinerary. Here is a summary of the most economical journey from Shanghai to various destinations upon inquiry:</p>
<p>Shanghai to Kunming, 95.09 yuan in national currency (steerage on ship, fourth class on train, food and lodging not included).</p>
<p>Shanghai to Guiyang, 88.19 yuan in national currency (same as above).</p>
<p>Shanghai to Qijiang, 106.29 yuan in national currency (same as above).</p>
<p>Shanghai to Chongqing, 112.59 yuan in national currency (same as above).</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Ling asked about the situation in Shenyang, Northeast China:</p>
<p>(Answer) To go from Shanghai to Shenyang, you can first take a Dalian Steamship Company ship to Dalian. The third-class fare is 18 Japanese gold. Then take a train from Dalian directly to Shenyang. The third-class fare is 6.15 Japanese gold. Before buying a ticket, you should first apply for a pass from the Japanese Consulate here before starting the journey. We cannot purchase the boat and train tickets on your behalf.</p>

<p>After reading Mr. Ximon's article "The Huxi Commune" in the 17th issue of this journal, I felt that its content was not entirely accurate and needed to be supplemented. Based on my observations, I offer the following to this journal to present a more general picture.</p>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, the Huxi Commune was closed for two months due to certain reasons. After several negotiations, it resumed operations in November of last year. Due to environmental restrictions, its facilities have been reduced compared to before the war: the small soccer goalposts and basketball hoops on the playground have also been removed. Apart from the slides for children, there is no other sports equipment or apparatus to be found in the sports field. As for the reading room, it no longer exists. Only one or two copies are kept for the staff to read, presumably to avoid "accidents"!</p>
<p>Under these difficult circumstances, the work of the Huxi Commune can be roughly divided as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Staff Children's Primary School - This was established entirely for those laborers working day and night in factories, so that their children could have the opportunity to receive an education. Tuition is low, at most three yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Destitute Children's Class - The Destitute Children's Class starts at 2 pm. The teachers are not graduates of normal schools, but students selected from the Staff Children's School who are excellent in both character and academics. They are implementing Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "Little Teacher System," and their performance is excellent. Tuition is completely free for the Destitute Children's Class, and books are also provided by the commune.</p>
<p>(3) Staff Evening Supplementary School - Divided into English and Chinese Arithmetic classes, classes are held from 7 pm to 9 pm. The students are all factory workers or shop apprentices. They use their spare time to improve their knowledge, giving them the opportunity to "work and study." Fees are also low.</p>
<p>(4) Free Clinic - From 2 pm to 5 pm every afternoon, doctors and nurses appointed by the Chinese Medical Association come to the commune to diagnose the illnesses of the poor. Only a registration fee of three cents is charged, and medical expenses are waived.</p>
<p>(5) Library - Currently limited to students, expansion is planned.</p>
<p>(6) Games Room - The large auditorium is equipped with two ping-pong tables as a games room, where Huxi workers can play ball and rest at any time. Although there are no ball racks on the playground, they can still play soccer, so more than a hundred people come to the commune to exercise every day.</p>
<p>(7) Sunday School - Every Sunday morning, teaching clergymen come to the commune to hold Sunday School, in which all students can participate.</p>
<p>(8) Public Bathhouse - During the height of summer, the bathhouse is open, and everyone can bathe for a small fee of two or three cents.</p>
<p>(9) People's Canteen - The People's Canteen, which is being prepared, will offer simple and hygienic dishes at low prices to solve the livelihood problems of the hard-working people in Huxi, and to eliminate various unsanitary food stalls on the streets.</p>
<p>(10) Other - Services such as smallpox vaccination and preventative injections for civilians are free of charge.</p>
<p>It is admirable that the Huxi Commune can continue to struggle and work hard in the harsh environment of Huxi, tirelessly organizing the various public welfare undertakings mentioned above. The perseverance of the organizers and the spirit of the members have immeasurably benefited the laboring class in Huxi.</p>
<h3>Perspectives on Shanghai's Flourishing Silver Shops</h3>
<p>— (Bumin)</p>
<p>—A Conversation with Mr. Huang Yuqi—</p>
<p>On the 17th, this newspaper published an article about silver shops related to Li Qiuwu. Out of curiosity and a desire for knowledge, the reporter consulted Mr. Huang Yuqi, who was the first founder of silver shops in Shanghai and the head of the most well-funded and largest-scale silver shop, Huizhong. Following Mr. Huang's introduction, I interviewed several respected figures in the industry. They were all open and honest in providing me with a thorough understanding, which gave me a new perspective.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Huang, "The term 'silver shop' appeared before banks. In the past, they were government-run, but now they are commercially operated, so the organization and management methods are different from the past. China's economy is backward, and the majority of society is composed of the 'struggling merchants' described by Mr. Li, who do not have access to the benefits of banks and money shops. Therefore, silver shops came into being as financial organizations serving the general business community. Their current state of development proves that they are an urgent need in society."</p>
<p>"As for not requiring an introduction to open an account at a silver shop," Mr. Huang continued, "this is a necessary measure to implement the principle of serving the general public. However, this is not unique to silver shops. Several banks with millions of capital also do not require introductions for new accounts. I believe that as long as someone is a legitimate merchant, they should have the right to open an account. As for handling fees, ticket posting fees, and ledger fees, these are common rules in the silver and money industry and are legitimate sources of income in the profit and loss statements of the silver and money industry."</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of returned check fees, the reporter asked, "Does charging a 30-cent returned check fee seem inconsistent with the original purpose of serving small and medium-sized businesses?"</p>
<p>"Whether returned check fees should be charged is indeed a matter worth discussing in the practical operations of the silver and money industry. In theory and from the perspective of negotiable instruments law, checks involve capital relationships and should not be returned in the first place. However, in reality, due to the general lack of understanding of negotiable instruments among Chinese merchants, returned checks are unavoidable. In order to minimize returned checks, the silver and money industry has had to come up with a remedial measure. Some charge 50 cents, while others charge 30 cents. This is a passive countermeasure to deal with practical matters and is not a goal in itself. As for a certain silver shop having 300 returned checks per day, this is a joke. Regardless of whether this number is unfounded, such a phenomenon would never occur in reality."</p>
<p>The reporter then asked, "So, I also heard that thirteen yuan and a few cents were deposited for two years and nothing was left. Is this true?"</p>
<p>Mr. Huang replied earnestly, "Do you believe that?" "If this news is unfortunately true, then it would be an unprecedented scandal! But after a little rational consideration, I couldn't help but laugh. My guess is that the customer made deposits and payments by check based on the ledger, and the amounts recorded in the ledger were simply one-sided income figures. Perhaps there was a mistake made there."</p>
<p>After expressing satisfaction and gratitude, the reporter said goodbye, and Mr. Huang said enthusiastically:</p>
<p>"In short, the silver shop industry in China is in the midst of vigorous development. We sincerely welcome and are willing to accept sincere criticism and correction from all sectors."</p>

<h3>After the Rain, Clear Skies</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: A Virtuous Mother with a Chignon and Green Skirt, A Lively Old Man with a Silver Beard and Emerald Sleeves</p>
<p>After lunch, Village Chief Zhu accompanied the two Miss Hes, as well as Zhu’s wife, Ai-ren, and Ai-qun, in the wife’s car. The five of them went to check out the site. Not far from Freedom Village, there was a canal with a wide surface and many boats coming and going. There were several plots of land there, all belonging to the village, and the highway ran along the canal, making it a good location for both water and land transportation. On the opposite bank were distant green hills and lush trees, resembling clusters of fishing villages and farmhouses. Village Chief Zhu said, "This side of the canal belongs to Freedom Village, and the other side does not belong to Freedom Village." He Shuangyu asked, "What is that place called?" Village Chief Zhu said, "That place is called Water Bamboo Village. The village chief's surname is Xu, and I know him. The man is over eighty years old this year." He Liyu thought to herself: Why are the so-called village chiefs here all old men? But she only thought about it and did not say it out loud. Village Chief Zhu continued, "This old Village Chief Xu is also quite something. He is truly a man who sacrificed his family to help the nation. Although he is a Water Bamboo Village resident, he is not a farmer. He went out to do business when he was young and did not live in the village. In his middle age, his business prospered, and he had several hundred thousand in assets. Later, he speculated in Shanghai and made a lot of money, immediately becoming a wealthy man. But he had no sons, nor even daughters. Actually, it doesn't matter if you don't have children, but the Chinese have always valued succession, and having no descendants is a major regret in life. At the time, many friends advised him to adopt a son or adopt a daughter. People knew that he was wealthy and were willing to give him their children, so that they could inherit his property in the future. But this old man was very stubborn and did not want anyone else's children. He also sensed that people wanted to give him their children for his wealth. So if they were not his own children, he would rather not have them, and preferred to be a lonely old man. At this time, his original wife had already died, and he had married two subsequent wives, who had also died. People advised him to take a concubine, but he said that he was old and would not harm anyone else's daughter in her youth. In fact, many people were willing to marry this old man, also for his wealth, knowing that he would not live much longer. After he died, they could enjoy themselves in peace, or remarry someone else. But the old man Xu refused. When the Chinese war came, the old man Xu was also over seventy years old. He donated all his property to the country, except for a portion that was in the occupied territories and could not be recovered at the time. He thought it through thoroughly: rather than letting it fall into the hands of who knows who, it is better to serve the country." (114)</p>
<h3>The Three Musketeers</h3>
<p>— Yan Hua</p>
<p>“The 3 Musketeers”</p>
<p>A 20th Century Fox Production, Showing at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>Unveiling the struggles between the French royal family and the power of the Cardinal, Alexandre Dumas's "The Three Musketeers" is unforgettable. The bravery of the young swordsman D'Artagnan, the treachery of the Cardinal, and the loyalty of the Three Musketeers to the French King, are all sketched out by Dumas's pen, portraying heroes and beauties.</p>
<p>Reflected in films, we have seen the silent film era's Douglas Fairbanks starring in "The Three Musketeers" and "The Three Musketeers Continued." Then, in the sound era, the talking "The Three Musketeers" followed, in which amidst the clanging of swords, D'Artagnan's rendezvous with the maid Constance, the Queen's anxiety when the brooch had not yet arrived for the ball, and the Cardinal's shock when he saw the brooch on the Queen's chest before the King—these are all dramatic materials. No wonder Hollywood seizes them and refuses to let go, repeatedly filming "The Three Musketeers."</p>
<p>This "Three Musketeers" film makes the Three Stooges create as many laughs as possible, so it has been slightly altered from the original. For example, D'Artagnan used to go to London to retrieve the brooch from the French Duke, encountering many dangers along the way, but now D'Artagnan only steals the brooch from the Duchess de Winter, who stole it from the Duke. Many dangerous scenes have been omitted here.</p>
<p>Speaking of the altered parts, although it is not as tense as the previous "Three Musketeers," its comedic atmosphere is indeed quite lovely.</p>
<p>Beneath the humorous cartoonishness, the Three Stooges, wearing the "Three Musketeers" hat and sword, seem much more clever because they have a dramatic story like "The Three Musketeers" to work with, rather than just messing around and staring blankly while making strange noises as before.</p>
<p>In terms of performance effects, the entire film is quite exciting and funny. Its better scenes include the following:</p>
<p>(1) D'Artagnan, impersonating the Cardinal, drives a six-horse carriage towards Paris with the maid Constance—the atmosphere and use of the camera in this scene are excellent. The posture of the six horses galloping on the country road, the horseshoes flying in the low-angle shot, the Cardinal's guards on horseback coming from the sky, the coachman leaving the driver's seat, D'Artagnan climbing from the rear of the carriage to the front seat, and then lunging onto the horse's back to grab the reins... The contrasting techniques make this scene reach the expected climax.</p>
<p>(2) Before the Queen goes to the ball, she has not yet received the diamond brooch, but when she and the King bow to other noblewomen, a hand reaches out from behind the curtain, holding a shining diamond brooch ("close-up": the Queen takes the brooch), the Queen calmly stands in front of the Cardinal... Slowly removing her feathered fan, her chest reveals the brooch that shocks the Cardinal...</p>
<p>Don Ameche plays D'Artagnan. His singing and swordsmanship are brave enough, but also just barely passable. The Three Stooges' copper drum dance, with cymbals all over their bodies, makes the audience laugh out loud when the three of them dance.</p>
<p>However, there is one irredeemable regret in the whole film: the real "Three Musketeers" appear, but after being drunk, they disappear and the Three Stooges mess around until the end. This is an irreparable loophole.</p>
<p>The actor playing the Cardinal is not treacherous and cunning enough. Lionel Atwill has too few scenes and cannot show his talents.</p>
<p>The Three Stooges' very nonsensical scenes reduce the more reasonable humorous scenes interspersed, such as stretching their backs after riding horses, and pretending to be the Cardinal's son and interrupting the guards, allowing D'Artagnan to enter the palace. These are much more pleasing than the purely blind noise of the past.</p>

<h3>Talking About Yuan Yuandan and Gai Jiaotian</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guyu</p>
<p>Yuan Yuandan was the top student of the Fu Liancheng troupe. His original name was Gao Xiyu. He played both female roles, martial roles, and acrobatic female roles. Although his appearance was not beautiful, his waist and leg skills were solid, and his stability was unparalleled. He came to Shanghai in the second year of the Republic and gained a great reputation. The following autumn, he returned north and joined the Shuangqing Society at the invitation of Yu Zhenting, performing at the Wenming Garden. His performances were often the main attraction. The supporting actors were all his fellow students, such as Zhong Xijiu, Hou Xirui, Chen Xide, Guo Xifang, and Guo Xiqing. The playbill also included the words "Newly Returned from Shanghai," which showed how grand the situation was.</p>
<p>Gai Jiaotian was from Gaoyang, Hebei. His original name was Zhang Yingjie. His art was based on Li Chunlai, steady and dignified. In his early years, he was excellent in relying on his voice, and his play "The Attack on Zidu" once dominated the stage. In his middle age, he switched to short, action-packed plays. Jiao Qingli, Li Deshan, Tan Yongkui, and Qi Caifen were all good partners for Gai. In the early years of the Republic, his momentum was strongest. In the winter of the fourth year of the Republic, he returned to his hometown to visit relatives. He passed through Beiping and was retained by Yu Zhenting, performing at Jixiang. The first day's repertoire was "The Four Heroes Village," listed after Mei Lanfang and Wang Fengqing's "Fenhe Bay" (Mei was very popular at this time). Yu Zhenting and Zhu Guifang's "Attack on Tongguan" was fourth from the bottom, which was actually the most glorious page in the history of the southern stage. Now, Yuan Yuandan cannot gain a foothold in Tianjin and fell in Harbin. Gai Jiaotian is performing on stage again, but it is difficult to get a seat without begging. Looking back on those years, there is a true sense of "past events are unbearable to recall."</p>
<h3>A Viewing of the Shanghai Bank Peking Opera Society's Rehearsal</h3>
<p>— Lao Yang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bank Colleagues Peking Opera Society held its third rehearsal at 7 pm on the third afternoon. I, the reporter, was fortunate to be seated in the last row and enjoyed a feast for the ears. By the time the play ended and I returned home, it was already midnight. Rubbing my tired eyes, I will briefly record the outline. My words are not worthy of the attention of the elegant. I arrived a little late, and the "Tifang" had already reached its finale, so I only heard half of his slow Xipi.</p>
<p>The second play was "Cosmic Peak." The actress playing Zhao Nv was Wei Meiyu. Her appearance was delicate and graceful, fitting the identity of a young lady. Her singing was smooth and she was not a novice, which was extraordinary. However, her voice was slightly astringent, making her seem strained. I don't know if this was due to practicing her voice. Ms. Zhu's face is full at the top and narrow at the bottom. She can slightly stick out the part near the cheekbones. The lipstick she applied was also slightly too light. If these small points are modified, there may not be much obvious difference when she puts on makeup in front of the mirror, but it will definitely increase the beauty when viewed from the stage below. This is originally a major play for Qingyi, and even experts don't easily perform it. However, Ms. Zhu's performance was balanced and steady, neither too hot nor too cold, which was truly not easy. Her lying-down body movements showed her skill.</p>
<p>The third play was "Fenhe Bay." Wu Hongyou and Ms. Wu Danru played the fake couple, making the "Trouble at the Kiln" scene even more realistic. I wonder if Mr. Wu had forgotten that he was an actor when he knelt down to apologize. (laughs) I heard that Mrs. Wu was making her debut on the stage, but her singing and acting were all stable and flawless, which was commendable. Her voice was broad and sweet. With further polishing, her potential is limitless. I heard that Mr. Wu has been on stage several times, but he has always played comic roles, and this was his first time playing a Lao Sheng. His appearance was majestic and upright, showing the demeanor of the half-Liao King. Mr. Wu should decide to abandon his comic roles and study Lao Sheng from now on. This play has more acting than singing, which makes amateur performers afraid. Mr. and Mrs. Wu's cooperation was skillful and did not seem like their first time performing together. This cannot be achieved without talent. Specifically speaking, Mr. Wu's recitation is better than his singing, and Mrs. Wu's singing and acting are better than her recitation. These humble opinions may be of assistance to Mr. and Mrs. Wu in their discussions. Su Xiaxuan and Ms. Su Shiqiu played the old landlord and Xue Dingshan respectively. Ms. Shiqiu's voice was broad and bright, and her singing had a lot of charm. Her small test of her skills was not enough to show her full potential. When Xue Pinggui appeared for the second time, singing "Leaving Fenhe Bay..." in a continuous stream, the scene started with a Yao Ban, but the first two sentences did not match the singing. It was not until the third sentence that they were in sync. I don't know why. I, the reporter, have no stage experience with this play and dare not assume I am right, but I will record it here and ask those who were present that day to correct me.</p>
<p>The fourth play was "Dianhe Yang." Zhao Zhongguang played Liu Bei, Chen Baode played Zhao Yun, and Zhu Xieqing played Zhou Yu. The combination was well-matched and the chemistry was extraordinary. Both actors put in a lot of effort, with excellent singing and acting. Liu Huangshu's sudden joy and fear were deeply expressed. Zhou Dudu's inner thoughts were expressed through his performance. Zhou Jiangjun's energy was full and he was fearless, all vividly portrayed. They are not much different from professionals. However, there is a difference of one tone between Mr. Zhu's and Mr. Chen's voices. It seems that both of them felt a little strained when choosing the right key. Because I, the reporter, had other matters to attend to, I left before the end and could not enjoy "Fan Jiangguan," which was a pity. The reception by the above-mentioned people was warm and courteous, and they were meticulous in their entertainment. Their spirit of dedication is admirable.</p>
<h3>About "Cloud Garment Fairy"</h3>
<p>Chen Yunshang's "Cloud Garment Fairy," which was filmed after "Mulan Joins the Army," has been completed in terms of editing and other projects, and will be released by Shanghai's two major film companies in the near future. "Cloud Garment Fairy" is a masterpiece of domestic song and dance films. It has four great song and dance scenes, and the scenery is more magnificent than any previous song and dance film. Chen Yunshang specially made dozens of costumes for filming "Cloud Garment Fairy." She appears in different costumes in each shot. There are more than a dozen famous songs, mostly sung by Ms. Chen, with the full participation of all students of the Xinhua Dance Troupe.</p>

<h3>A Further Record of Dance Traces</h3>
<p>The comic role playing a bailiff in "Fishing and Killing the Family" often says "Leaving the house" at the beginning, some adding "It's still that sentence," which can usually amuse the audience. Doing dance articles is the same. After doing them over and over again, they only write about the same things: "dance guests," "dance girls," and dance halls. I'm tired of writing it myself. Surprisingly, some people still send letters of praise, saying that it contains philosophical thoughts and is beneficial to social morality. Some even invite me to dinner. This really makes me feel infinitely grateful on the one hand and ashamed on the other. I feel like I can't write anything for this issue. Oh well, since I wrote about dance traces last issue, I won't do one again this time. It's like saying "Leaving the river, coming home," even though it's said by a comic role, it's still interesting.</p>
<p>Because I always write my articles on Friday, I'm always in a hurry. So, after sending in my last article, I decided that I would definitely write the title in my notebook on Sunday. It's quiet and comfortable to write at that time. After I wrote the title for this issue, I thought of a way to add supplementary material. Originally, I always went to dance halls passively, following the ideas of my friends. How about being more proactive? That is, I can go or not as I please. If I do go, I can only write about the places I've been to this period in the next issue. Otherwise, I won't accompany them. This way, I can add more material to my articles, and it seems like I'm feeling a new kind of fun. The following dance halls are listed in order of my visits:</p>
<p>Weigong—It's across from the Shanghai Bank and next to the Dengshuo Mo Hotel. The advertisement says it's like going to Peach Blossom Dock. A friend invited me to lunch, which suited my heart. There's a fake rockery cave on the stairs leading to the entrance. Lanterns and flowers are placed every three steps, and willows are placed every five steps, hidden in the dim light. It's really hard to tell the real from the fake. There are also several thatched huts inside, which emit a creaking sound. Where does this sound come from? Forgive me for not announcing it for the time being. You can go see for yourself.</p>
<p>Xinhua—I probably wrote about the general situation in the fourth issue. Now, other than the dance girl Chen Rong having changed slightly, there are no other changes. This time, we went with partners, so we only danced with Lin Yamei once. Yamei's face is not beautiful, but it has a refined air. She has lost some weight recently, making her look even more slender. If men were to talk about it, they would say she has a bit of a scholarly air. When I said she was thin, she insisted she was fat, but the smile on her face always had a forced look. It is said that she has been seen recently. Could she have some unspeakable secret?</p>
<p>Xiaoyao—It's really strange. One night, a friend invited me and actually brought three popular dance girls from high-end dance halls to Xiaoyao. At first, when I heard about Xiaoyao, I didn't know where it was. When we arrived, I realized it was the former Queen's Theater. The stage has been changed into a music platform, which seems a bit too big. The dance floor seems too long, but the floor is still smooth. The seats and people are certainly not comparable to those in high-end dance halls, but there are quite a few dance girls. I just took a quick look, but there are probably beauties within ten steps.</p>
<p>Anlegong—The name ABC is in the eastern section of Avenue Edward VII. I patronized it quite often last year. I haven't been there for a long time, but it's still the same. The lunchtime music seems too lively. My friend originally taught Shu Yunlan and received two apprentices, A Zhen and A Zhu, who are from Hangzhou. They can write a few words and are said to have graduated from elementary school.</p>
<p>Xianle—After going to small dance halls for a few days, going to a big dance hall again naturally makes me feel luxurious and magnificent. However, that night, several friends and I had things to do early the next morning, so we just sat there for a while and returned feeling bored. This shows that the power of the mind is ultimately greater than the power of the environment. The Buddha said that everything is created by the mind, and the Confucian said that contentment brings happiness. A mind that is not content can make people feel that they would be happier staying at home, even more than going to a dance hall.</p>
<p>In addition, I went to Dahua and Dadu Hui once each. The article is already long, so I won't write much more. At Dahua, I met a dance star who is also called Hu Ying and is also quite beautiful. It is said that the Changzhou Hu Ying only dances at night. However, is that person from Changzhou really called Hu Ying? Or can we only say that it's uncertain? I can only scold myself and say I'm very confused.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two things about the late righteous actor Luo Kuifang are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The first thing is when he was first making a name for himself in Beiping. It was during the late Qing Dynasty, before private performances were abolished. Xiao Bao was born at the wrong time. Since he was in this line of work, he naturally couldn't break this bad environment. He had to come out and pour wine with a group of fellow students. At that time, he was only around twenty years old. He had delicate features and fair skin. He had a long braid and bangs. Wearing a Thirteen Taibao vest, he was indeed a handsome man. At that time, he was greatly favored by a certain general, who often invited him out to drink. On days when he had a performance, the general would definitely reserve several rows of seats or several boxes, spending a lot of money on him. This matter was seen as a great honor by Xiao Bao's group of fellow students, who were all envious. However, Xiao Bao himself not only didn't appreciate it, but also deeply hated the general's entanglement, as if he was deliberately trying to insult him. However, because he had a strict teacher by his side at the time, he could only feel resentment in his heart. Later, he suddenly realized that if he didn't get rid of this inhuman life early, he would never have a chance to rise up in the future. After he made up his mind, he continued to feign compliance with the general on the one hand, and secretly studied the old Sheng roles on the other hand. Sometimes when Lao Tan sang "Empty City Stratagem," Xiao Bao would ask his teacher to tell the backstage manager to assign him the role of a qintong (at that time, Lao Tan was in the same troupe as Yao Qing). So, he later became famous for singing "Empty City" because he had been one of the qintongs several times and had heard Lao Tan's tunes very clearly. The general didn't see through his secret intentions at all and still spared no effort in supporting him. Who would have thought that as soon as he left his apprenticeship, he would immediately become a student of a certain boss and specialize in Song Sheng roles? He even made three rules with his newly apprenticed teacher. The first rule was that he would no longer go out to pour wine, so as not to hinder his studies. Because of all these things he did, he didn't tell the general in advance. When the general repeatedly invited him, he refused to go. The general asked someone to find him, but he refused to meet him several times. The general was so angry that he almost went crazy. From then on, the two of them broke off contact. Later, the general desperately spent money to organize a troupe and tried his best to make a certain actress popular, said to be because he was stimulated by Xiao Bao and was venting his anger out of disappointment.</p>
<h3>Xuan Palace Tonight's Rehearsal</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Tonight is Saturday night again. In addition to the usual "Peking Opera Joint Performance" at Xuan Palace, there will also be a rehearsal. A stage will be added to the music, and colored scenery will be hung in front of the musicians' seats. This is truly an unprecedented record for a dance hall, giving dance guests a lot of interest and constantly stimulating them until dawn. According to a certain spokesperson, he can guarantee that the guests will not yawn once. According to the investigation, there are a total of three plays rehearsing tonight. One is the dance star Fan Peilan's "Qijie" and Zhang Yetao Suqiu's "New Cotton Spinning." Another is the "Touring Dragon and Playing Phoenix" of the seven-year-old Lingtong Primary School Zhuanlan, which is not easy to see elsewhere. It is admirable that such young children are performing those women's things, which is enough to satisfy many. Finally, I will report on the Xuan Palace's garden dance hall, the jealousy work, and the follow-up.</p>

<h3>Mongolia and Russia Open Trade Routes</h3>
<p>Russia has opened two new routes in the northern border of Mongolia, directly reaching the central land, one is Gulgia, one is Kai'ajia. It is said that there are already 150 camels and 10 people trying this route, transporting a total of 1,500 pieces of Chinese goods.</p>
<h3>Leisurely Comments on Theater</h3>
<p>Theaters in Shanghai stand tall, but Jin Gui of Dan Du Village is known as the best; however, Jin Gui is only great at martial arts, with knives, spears, swords, halberds and somersaults, which quickly gets boring. The singing and acting of the actors and actresses are simply not on the same level; not as compelling and talented as Dan Gui. For example, Yang Yuelou is lively and spirited, with beautiful art and good looks; Han Guixi is lively and exuberant, to the point of perfection; Chen Jitai and Tian Hei are as fast as monkeys and as light as flying swallows, which is good to behold. Compared to Jin Gui's Yue Shan and Hei Er, they are no better. Others, such as Jing Sibao and Wu Fengming, mimic the actors perfectly; Tu Bian Er and Zao Er are playful. As for the beautiful scenery and the pearly and melodious voices, there is Wang Guifang and Li Dixiang; elegant and unconventional, and unrestrained, there is Du Dieyun and Feng Sanxi; vying to outdo each other, and trying their best, there is An Jingzhi; the others have their own strengths and are hard to list; the admiration is well placed.</p>

<p>The first line of the couplet was created by this newspaper's poetry forum, here are some of the best responses:</p>
<p>(1) Smoke and fire are everywhere, when the flowers wither and the smoke dissipates, what will be the outcome? Clouds and rain fill the sky, but one day the rain will stop and the clouds will scatter, revealing the true form.</p>
<p>(2) Sun and moon combine to bring light and divide day and night. Sons and daughters together judge the world.</p>
<p>(3) Because fire becomes smoke, if you don't discard it, it will always be suffering. Wanting the heart, to remove it, can be called human.</p>
<p>(4) The self-ringing clock rings twelve times, always self-ringing. The ferry boat swings people over and over, always swinging.</p>
<p>(5) Dongting Lake, Dongting Mountain, the land is divided between Wu and Chu. Tianzhu Kingdom, Tianzhu Temple, the names are famous in China and foreign lands.</p>
<p>To be published tomorrow: Foreigners being burned at the manufacturing bureau. Qi Chang earns interest.</p>
