<p>社評</p>
<h3>德國向波蘭開火</h3>
<p>「…自今晨五時四十五分起，業已開火…」</p>
<p>德國元首希特勒氏於昨日即九月一日，在彼衆議院演說德波問題之際，作此開火之宣告。此非德國對波蘭之變態宣戰歟？此非歐洲和平之喪鐘歟？抑或世界第二决大戰開慕之信號歟？歐戰則如何？世界大戰則如何？影響遠東又如何？凡此問題，久已縈廻於人人心頭；及今經德元首之宣告開火而追求問題之答案必允迫切。凡事或可逆覩，或難預言，未可一槪而論；關於遠東者易知，關於世變者難料；謂必如何如何，本報未願對讀者作此不負責任之議論也。</p>
<p>關於德波開火後之情况，正在多方面開展之中，詳載新聞欄。至今晨記者握管時爲止，比較允關重要之消息，竊願提示於此者凡四：（一）英國宣布總動員，（二）法國宣布總動員，（三）蘭駐英大使口頭通知英國當局，德國對波侵略行爲，已犯英波互助協定之條款，（四）美國財政復興局表示，歐戰爆發後，美國貨物輸往英法兩國者，由進出口銀行代爲付款，復興局與進出口銀行不受「强生法」之限制。此四者，應視爲（一）波蘭期待英國援助（二）英法已實行其作戰前之最後一步，（三）美國準備自經濟方面援助英法。除此之外，有極關重要之事項而尚無消息者，請揭於决：</p>
<p>（一）德國陸空兩軍業已進襲波蘭，德波兩方俱有此項電訉，同時各方俱稱德波已開始對抗行動；但波蘭對於侵入之敵軍，未聞開始其正面之抵抗戰爭；</p>
<p>（二）英國於獲悉德元首演說之後，猶作「此項演說是吾即係對波宣戰」之疑問，未聞斷言於其同盟國旣受侵略，更未聞立即發動援助波蘭；</p>
<p>（三）義大利爲德國之軍事同盟國，前晚猶向法國表示願効調停之勞，及今德軍已襲波蘭，德元首已宣告開火，而未聞義國如何自處；</p>
<p>（四）蘇聯與德國之互不侵犯條的，有其若干積極性，今締的國之一方面已宣吿開火，尚未聞蘇聯有何表示。</p>
<p>凡此四者，吾人最應注意；今後戰局如何開展，將視此項消息之內容如何而轉移；而其內容究將何若，即非吾人今日所宜預言者也。</p>
<p>歷史輒循環而非必循環，世界第一决大戰所予吾人之敎訓雖極豐富，顧未可遽以當時之一切敎訓，論衡今後。此關於各國政治與經濟以及戰略者，今昔種種不同，而空軍之進步，允必造就現代戰爭之新局面，是無論矣；更可設一問題於此，即「德軍若得佔領但澤與波蘭走廊，則德國在軍事上對英軍法軍取何軍略？在外交上對英國法國取何策略？」此一問題，可能之答案不知共凡幾焉，亦今後不可思議之局面不知共凡幾焉，何况問題甚多。然則預言不可捉摸之將來，甯若嚴密注視事實之演變耶？</p>
<p>至於遠東，事屬整個世界之一環，當然感受歐局不可隔離之影響。然就遠東之本體言之：遠東關鍵，繋於日本之是吾根本放棄其對華侵略政策，是否撤回其侵略隊伍？日本若侵略不已，中國必抗戰不已。日本在第一决世界大戰時獲得經濟上之黃金時代，而當前之對華侵略與再度之黃金時代不可得兼者也，此雖非今日之日人所能考慮，然事實上確有此値得考慮之一問題；中國惟有抗戰圖存，無所考慮。日本軍需，取給歐美，今以歐局而歐洲之來源斷絕，以美國廢止商的而美國之來源亦不可久持，蘇聯之遠東鐵道又未嘗爲日本運軍需；此在中國方面則與日本頗多不同之處。總而言之，日本是吾爲歐局而放棄其侵略政策爲別一問題，而中國之不以歐局而停止抗戰則絕無疑問。更就遠東之環境言之：歐局若此，於是美國與蘇聯之意嚮與行動，足以影響及於遠東者。爲力愈增；即此一端，可知遠東侵略國決不得以歐局而在遠東獲得特殊機會。</p>
<p>抑今日之事，止於德國對波蘭「開火」而巳，擴而爲歐戰。爲世界大戰，固屬意想中之開展，然竭世界之聰明力量，又何嘗絕無希望於制止星火，不使燎原！</p>

<p>莫斯科　蘇聯聯邦院及民族院聯席會議今晚在克姆林宮舉行、當即討論議程中之第三項、批准蘇德不侵犯條的問題、參加者極衆、除外交人物包箱及蘇聯與國外記者席外、均無空席、當史達林·莫洛託夫·卡昂諾維支·加里寗·米高揚·齊達諾夫·赫魯薛夫·貝里亞·馬倫柯夫·薛耶託夫以及最高議會主席各委員、各人民委員長等出席時、全塲起立歡呼、對史達林及其同志表示歡迎、旋安德萊也夫請求莫洛託夫同志對批准德蘇不侵犯公約作一報吿、當由莫氏起立致詞、演說達一小時之久、聽者動容、並時報以歡呼、足證一般對蘇聯和平政策擁護之熱烈、莫氏致詞畢、由議員史邦巴柯夫起立稱、莫氏演詞對蘇聯外交政策已加以充分闡明故已無辯論之必要、根據史議員動議、兩院分別投票決定贊成政府外交政策、並批准本年八月二十三日簽訂之蘇德不侵犯條約、（三十一日塔斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　莫洛托夫本日於最高議會席上、發表關於蘇德互不侵犯公約之演說、辭云、「同志諸君、自最高議會三屆全會以來、國際形勢並無進步、正相反、且更趨於緊張、各國政府雖會設法消滅此種局勢、但其努力並不充分、亦無成效、歐洲如此、東亞方面亦然、日本軍隊仍佔領中國各主要城市及不小部份領土、此外、日本更繼續對蘇聯從事敵對行動、在此種局勢下、蘇聯與德國之締結互不侵犯公的、確有重大的積極價値、因能消滅德蘇兩國間之戰爭危機、爲充分說明此公的之意義起見、余必須先將數月來與英法兩國代表在莫斯科進行之談判、加以分析、</p>
<p>「諸君共知英法蘇三國關於絲結歐洲方面反侵略互助公的之談判、係於本年叫月開始、諸君亦知最初英政府之建議、全非吾國所能接受、因其完全抹殺此種談判之主要先決條件、即義務之相互與平等原則、但蘇聯政府並米因此而拒絕談判、僅自行提出己方之建議、緣吾人深知英法兩國政府突然變更共截至最近猶對蘇聯不友好之政策、而根據義務平等之條件與吾國從事莊嚴談判、實大不易、嗣後談判亦並無良好結果、經過四個月之後、僅助使問題數項得以闡明、同時亦使英法兩國代表認識蘇聯在國際事件上、爲必須重視之國家、然而談判終遭遇不能尅服之困難、且不在各個「方案」或公的草案之某一條文上、而另有更嚴重之成因、</p>
<p>「反侵略互助公的之締結、如欲發生實效、必須英法蘇三國關於抵抗侵略國進攻之切實軍事步驟、成立協定、因此、有一時期、不但政治談判、即軍事談判亦曾在莫斯科與英法代表共同進行、但此項軍事談判、亦無結果、緣應被英法蘇三國共同保障之波蘭、竟拒絕蘇聯之軍事援助、嗣後雖屢曾設法加以尅服、但並無成效、且也、談判之經過、並證明英國不但無尅服波蘭此項反對立塲之意、甚至加以慫恿、波蘭之態度旣屬如此、英法蘇談判顯然自無成功之望、後此吾人更認識該談判已注定歸於失敗、</p>
<p>「英法蘇談判之經過、說明英法兩國之立塲、自始至終、含有不少鮮明之矛盾、</p>
<p>首先、一方面英法兩國要求蘇聯於波蘭被侵略時與以軍事援助、君等共知蘇聯誠　接受此項要求、惟英法對蘇聯應給與同樣援助、別方面、英法兩國復勾引波蘭出頭、堅決拒絕蘇聯之軍事援助、援助旣被認爲不必要及强行干預、則互助協定又安能有成立之望其次一方面英法向蘇聯提供反侵略軍事援助之擔保、以報答蘇聯方面之同樣援助、別方面彼等乃於其援助上、加以足以使其化爲幻影之關於間接侵略之保留條件、並附加法律形式上之遁辭、果得避免實施援助、而陷蘇聯於對侵略者孤立之地位、此種「互助公的」與欺騙公的又有何別、復次、一方面英法兩國特別指出互助公約談判之重要、從而要求蘇聯對之特別重視、並迅速解決一切與公約有關之問題、別方面、英法本身對於談判乃表現極端因循輕率之態度、僅派並無切實權力之二等人物爲代表、例如英法兩國軍事代表抵達莫斯科時、即並無任何切實權力、甚至無權簽定任何軍事條的、（嘩笑）允有甚者、英國軍事代表團、且幷證明文件亦無之、（大笑）而經吾國軍事代表團要求之後、乃於談判破裂之前夕、方提出證明文件、且即此文件、仍非常含糊、即並無正當權力、英法兩國此種輕率態度、與故作游戲談判、而有意使整個事件、變爲毫無價値、又有何別、</p>
<p>英法兩國態度之此種本質上的矛盾、實爲談判破裂之主因、英法爾國之所以如此矛盾、自有其根本成因、一方面、英法政府畏懼侵略、從而冀與蘇聯成立互助公的、惟以增强其本國勢力爲限、別方面、英法政府復畏互助公的締結後、將使蘇聯增强、於此種畏懼心理、似竟壓過其他一切考慮、吾人惟有從此點出發、方能認識在英法指示下之波蘭國行動之眞相、（待續）（一日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>日本海軍的難題（續）</h3>
<p>在中國海和日本海的較較狹水道中，日本若不能採取適當的對抗辦法，潛艇對於日本的商業也許有破壞的效能。對抗潛艇戰，雖大有進步，若不能得到人艦兩種配備，還是無效。日本沒有軍艦，能在她所必要的海路上進行極有力的對抗潛艇戰。從頭說起，日木往朝鮮和上海的海路較銜接歐陸和英倫的海路還長，所以作有效的巡邏更爲困難，加以中國海岸綫是適於潛艇戰的。有效的巡邏海岸綫和遏止華人助敵作反日活動，却是極艱鉅的任務；中國海和日本海中需要大批日本輕巡洋艦驅逐艦和小兵艦之類。潛艇戰的重要，不應言之過低，只要一查遠東海軍力的分配，便可表示潛艇戰是遠東各海軍當局所牢記着的一個因素。英帝國最强有力的獨個潛艇隊，是在香港設立根據地？由續航力很長的最大潛艇十五艘組成；蘇聯在海參崴駐有重要的潛艇隊，這是人所皆知的。荷蘭在東印度也有很優秀的潛艇隊。</p>
<p>在外海中襲擊的軍艦，當從巡洋艦級中選出。日本的可能大敵，除蘇聯外，對於巡洋艦級都有編制優良的精銳艦隊。單是英國在太平洋或附近一帶便有巡洋艦不下十六艘，全是新式的。日本雖有三十七艘，但包括四千五百噸以下舊艦五艘。這些英國軍艦在襲擊時有巨大的威力，假如對抗日木，便有破壞日本貿易的效能。日本的巡洋艦總數三十七艘中。大部份必須保留着和戰鬥艦隊一同在本國担任正常任務，其餘巡洋艦中的更大部份必須從事對抗潛艇活動，和在中日兩國間海中作一般的巡邏。剩下來派往外海的巡洋艦，爲數無幾，只够對敵國貿易大收過路錢而不足保衛日本自己的海外貿易。</p>
<p>其次問題，是日本戰鬥艦隊在冒險侵犯速地時，將達到怎樣重大的因素。那答覆是，戰鬥艦隊的目的，是使艦隊的主人在指定的戰區內能佔優勢。日本戰鬥艦隊的軍艦九艘，大部份顯駐日本附近，例如戰鬥艦隊長泊該處時，在週圍一千五百哩內便可進行日本生存攸關的巡邏和其他行動，而不受對方巡洋艦隊的嚴重妨害。假使戰鬥艦隊的大部份不泊在日本至臺灣的區域內，那巡邏隊便將受對方巡洋艦的嚴重妨害，這些巡洋艦是屬於平均比日本戰艦速率高九或十海里的一類。日本的六艘戰艦，極不致於離開日本近處，其他三艘戰艦（是大戰前設計的軍艦）也許用作對抗來襲的軍艦，和護送遠征軍，這是可以想見的。但三艦都已年老，裝甲也窳劣，在確實戰爭中，不是英國十五艘戰艦中任何三艘的對手。</p>
<p>從上面簡短的概述，可得到下列的論斷。</p>
<p>（一）旣有一個國家擁着龐大的巡洋艦隊，於是速離日本的諸國，遭日本有力侵略的危險便很小，日本要侵略遠地，欲免自己的貿易不受重大損失，是不能成功的，即使貿易已有重大損失，非到日本已解决敵艦襲擊問題，遠侵還是不能完成的。應付來襲的敵艦這一目的，將使日本所有的海軍力受嚴重的消耗。</p>
<p>（二）潛艇隊攻擊日本，在日方貿易最集中迫近日本鈞海路上或附近一帶，最能收效。日本因有潛艇的威脅，所以供遠征用的軍艦將大為減少。</p>
<p>（三）戰起時，新加坡雖沒有敵對的戰鬥艦隊，日本仍不　發出龐大的戰鬥艦隊，遠離本國口岸而出征，因為敵方有着龐大的巡洋艦隊，將使日本戰鬥艦隊的大部份不得不留在日</p>
<p>（四）新加坡有了敵對的職鬥艦隊，譬如說以四艘爲限，即足使日本的戰鬥艦隊，全數留在日本至台灣的區域內，即非全數，也近全數。</p>
<p>（五）澳洲兩面有主力艦一艘，更不致惹起侵澳性質的軍事大行動，因為這種行動似極危險的。</p>
<p>（六）英國在太平洋中海軍戰的防禦戰略，是避免艦隊行動，只要一方面儘力使對方海軍，留守本國，一方面從事摧毀對方的海上貿易和軍事護送隊，便能收效。</p>
<p>（七）澳洲的防禦艦隊中，添入戰鬥艦一艘，效用非淺，然更迫切的需要，還未應付時，澳洲並不一定要得到戰艦，這該是不很遠將來的目標，現在該作初步的準備。（完）</p>
<h3>英武官史比亞　最近尚無釋放之望　英政府對此案似不甚關切</h3>
<p>字林報八月十八日北平通訊云、駐華英武官史比亞中校、被日軍拘捕而押往張家口凝禁者、已十二週於茲矣、英政府與公衆對於此英軍官之命運、似均不表甚大之關切、在此三閱月內、英政府匪特不能營救之、抑且不能使其早日「受審」、與夫改良其被禁情况、張家口日軍當局、恒以此案仍在調查中、作爲延宕「審問」託詞、他人不禁認爲縱屬事務最冗繁者、此時亦必已完畢其初步調查矣、設史中校為一日人、因眞正犯法而在英國被捕、當已於長久前受審矣、再、且准其同胞作法律上之援助、日軍當局、一再宣稱張家口軍事區在華北日軍總司令杉山之管轄下、杉山之司令部旣在北平、英政府何不能使史中校被移來本市、而在膳宿方面、得較在張家口優良多多之待遇歟、在此冗長之時期內、英政府所能獲得者、唯低級英軍官一名、准往張家口晤史中校而已、八月十二日、英國駐日通譯官、派柯大尉自東京飛抵北平、十四日飛張家口、亨納西少校得北平日軍司令部准許偕派柯大尉同行、許多人以爲派出較高級之軍官、例如英國駐日陸軍武官、則更相宜、但派少校之行、似已經長久之困難磋商、東京高級軍官始無奈准許之、再、此行經嚴格之諒解、始獲許可、即往訪者須在解英語之日人前唔史中校、且不得與史中校討論關於此案之事、若英政府刻取使渠早日得釋之步驟、則此項步驟、亦不得談論、故史中校初聞兩軍官往訪、以「有何用哉」爲理由、而拒不相見一事、至少普通人士對之不甚驚奇、聞官方解釋史中校最初之反響、謂由於被久覊而心神過勞之故、惟普通人士殆不以此種解釋爲然、而記者亦認爲此言未免造作、史中校被禁三月後、初晤本國軍官、而不准與之討論其朝夕縈念之本人案件事、則史中校之失望與憤懣反響、似極自然、此行僅爲探獄之行、其目的僅在探詢其個人情况與康健、似必屬創之復辱之、無論如何、兩英軍官終由兩日人偕同入史中校囚室中、然會談純屬敷衍、而僅涉及其個人情况、蓋彼等入室、史中校立即問英政府刻取何種營救步驟、彼等告以不能討論此事也、史中校身體狀况、至今令人滿意、絕無疾病、僅缺少運動、致面容稍形白胖而已、史中校被覊一小室中、實無運動、因須由囚室衛兵之一監視、始准出外、按照多數文明軍隊所遵從之軍事禮節、被禁之軍官、有權於運動時、由同級軍官一員護衛、職是之故、史中校非絕對必要勿利用其出外之權、渠對於供給食物之毫無更變、亦發不平之言、兩英軍官確知史中校仍生存、而尚康健、遂於翌日飛返北平報告、多數人士均不明瞭、此次敷衍之行、除係有關兩政府保全顏面之辦法外、有何目的、設三月之後、英政府所能爲者已盡於此、則史中校早日釋出之機會、似極遙遠也、</p>

<h3>歐戰爆發後　上海之一般局勢　外匯可轉鬆洋貨將騰貴　中國工商努力生產機會　英輪已候命集中</h3>
<p>自德國以但澤問題形成牽一髮而動全局之勢、致歐洲時局、益形杌隍、最近在和平奔走、未届絕望之際、而昨晚外電忽傳德軍已向波取軍事行動之訊、消息傳出、本埠中外人士、咸極關心允注視於此後之發展、本埠爲遠東第一商埠、就此項消息、所予一般市上之影響、頗爲各界所重視、茲將有關消息、分誌如决、</p>
<p>外滙轉鬆法幣有利</p>
<p>記者以歐戰如再爆發、於本埠金融將影響至何種程度、昨特往訪銀行界人士、據談、自金價逐步上漲、外匯緊縮、上海一般金融、自較過云為呆滯、惟自平準會竭力設法穩定外匯後、近數週來、已趨平定、此决歐洲軍事發動、雖其範圍尙不可知、然外匯方面、當可趨鬆、今後法幣與外匯之折合率、勢更平穩、亦即法幣基礎益形鞏固、至就中國對外貿易言、中國土貨之必需品、今後在國際市塲、必趨暢銷、蓋歐洲軍事行動之國家、旣因戰事而直接間接蒙受影響、工業生產、勢必减低、中國貨品乘機發展、實爲一良好機緣、</p>
<p>洋貨價格勢必騰貴</p>
<p>記者昨晚復就經營歐貨各中外商人方面、探詢因歐洲現狀惡化、所予各該業之影響、據談各點如下、以一般各歐貨經營者言、現時已運到之各種歐貨、今後趨勢、一致看漲、至於已訂貨品其已在途者、當可望設法運到、尙未啟運者、因外商航輪多被征調、勢難繼續運來、各種貨品今後既難暢達、故外匯雖可較鬆、而外貨在華價格、仍將上漲、</p>
<p>棉布顏料無甚影響</p>
<p>就主要與歐貨有關各業言、棉布類方面、歐貨近來進口、因外滙緊縮、及中國出品較多、故已年有减少、昨晚該業主要人士、曾有集議、認爲歐戰縱不幸爆發、該業於外匯方面、當亦無甚重大影響、顏料業方面、則自歐局緊張後、進口商曾急電英德等國催速裝貨來華、現正有大批貨品、在來華途中、預料本月中可望到達、本埠方面自滬戰後、各染織廠及皮毛皮革器具等廠、林立滬西、對於顏料、需要頗股、故此决顏料商鑒於歐局激盪、增訂貨品、據該業中人預料、如訂貨能迅速運到、此項顏料以及市上存貨、可望敷兩年之用、此外私人方面、亦多因歐局關係、投資訂購、故本年上半年顏料一項進口、達一千六百二十八萬一千四百十九元、較去年同期之四百八十九萬九千四百八十七元、增加一千餘萬之多、的當去年進口額之四倍、</p>
<p>五金缺貨呢絨上漲</p>
<p>此外五金業則雖曾急速訂貨、但因各國於緊張空氣中運出之貨、本已受有相當限制、故存貨聞亦不多、惟替代品件、國內間有製造、故預料當無甚影響、呢絨業則多數來自英國、法美比國等貨决之、近因外匯關係、價格均已上漲、惟該業訂貨已結外匯者、聞係少數、</p>
<p>中國努力生產機會</p>
<p>據商界人士觀察、此次軍事行動之範圍、尙難預料、即不能化干戈爲玉帛、但美國方面各種貨亦仍可能的源源運出、且中國近年以來、工業日臻發達、故各種歐貨、縱受時局影響、不能暢運來華、於中國市塲、絕不致如第一决歐洲大戰時之情景、所望經營歐貨之商人、勿過抬高市價、反受營業影響、反之、中國工商界於此歐局緊張中、又爲一努力生產之良好機會耳、</p>
<p>英輪奉令不准轉讓</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、駐滬英總領事署、昨日（三十一日）頒布駐華英大使寇爾爵士簽字之新條例、禁止英國船隻轉讓與其他國籍之人士或公司、由此可見歐洲危局對於上海的影響之佐證、是項條例、乃戰時之防範辦法、俾於戰爭發生時、保留英國船隻於英旗之下、新倏例規定今非得商部准許、不得轉讓或抵押英船或英船之股份、惟自治領船隻、不包括於新條例之內、因自治領對於在其領土中註冊之船隻、自定法律之故、此項新命令名曰「一九三九年英國船隻轉讓條例、」今已實行、英總領署船務處、會於八月三十日張貼初步警告、而於咋日揭下、該警告有戰事爆發後、英船不能轉讓等語、新條例未述及戰事爆發、而於是令簽字後、立即禁止轉讓與出售、昨據英總領署船務領事解釋稱、新條例乃戰時之防範辦法、然因歐局危急、故已付諸實行、歐局危急之結果、且使全世界英船、均歸海軍部統制、</p>
<p>各英輪均準備集中</p>
<p>歐洲局勢嚴重、外商航業影響至鉅、意輪汝廉該薩號、應於上月三十日返歐、因之停航在滬、於昨日中移泊德士古火油碼頭、預備長期停靠、法郵船琴拉寳號、原定昨日（一日）可到滬、該輪抵西貢後、本擬停在該處、後奉公司命、復駛來滬、延至明日（三日）到埠、以上各情、已誌昨報、今悉大英公司之Ranchi（倫欠）號、於八月一日自倫敦起程、開來遠東、本定明日（三日）可到滬、該輪於八月二十五日抵新加坡後、忽接總行電令、開回英倫、故已不來上海、下班之Ranpura（賴浦拉）號、於八月十五日自倫敦開出、的本月十七日可到滬、聞該輪至滬後、不赴日本、即於二十三日、代替倫欠號班期由滬開回倫教、至行駛中國沿海綫之怡和。太古兩公司、業已奉總行令、各輪加裝預備煤六百至一千噸、嗣後俟接緊急電令後、即向指定地點集中、惟昨晨怡和洋行之永生輪、原已預定於今午、開往威海衛。烟台·天津·之北洋綫、客貨亦已裝就、昨晨忽接港行電令、開往海防兼香港、遂將北洋貨起出後、於昨日下午四時出口、經香港赴海防、聞德波昨已發生銜突、今日本巿洋商輪船、如何趨勢、尙難預料、</p>
<p>英後備兵在滬無多</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、迄今所能確悉者、英當局並未召集僑滬之英陸海空三軍後備兵、據英海軍常局指稱、召集海外海軍後備兵、由各艦隊總司令定奪之、陸軍當局則表示、須得倫敦電令、始召後備兵、並認爲上海之陸軍後備兵、爲數無多、英海軍後備官佐三員、在本埠數商行充僱員者、已「出借」協助駐滬英海軍當局統制商航、據英大使館通知英總領署、戰事發生時、對於後備軍官將予以航行之特殊便利、本埠法租界中德僑、已得法當局通知、謂彼等苟無擾亂和平與秩序之舉動、則不致愛傷害及干涉、</p>
<p>滬滿倉電報禁用密碼</p>
<p>昨日本市各洋商輪船公司均接香港總行電告、謂凡拍至香港之電報、不論有綫無綫電中西文、均須明碼、禁用密碼</p>

<h3>海關被迫受僞劵　日方强佔收稅處　中行稅員無法執行職務　變相增稅影響英美貿易</h3>
<p>中央滬行電渝報吿經過</p>
<p>江海關昨日起、竟收受「華興券」、收稅處爲正金銀行日員强佔、中央銀行收稅人員、被迫撤退、急電渝總行報告、事實爲變相增稅、影響英美商人對華貿易、至中央銀行之關金兌換券、及華商行莊之票據、竟爲拒絕收受、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>滬關被迫　接受僞幣</p>
<p>「江海關監督」李建南、於八月三十一日公告、「自九月一日起、以海關金單位券與關金支票繳納關稅、概不受理、一切關稅與其他稅收、以「華興劵」繳納後、』江海關日籍額外副稅務司小山田晃中一、竟接受「李監督」之通知、於昨日起實行、稅務司羅福德雖擬提出折衷辦法、希望中央銀行收稅處不發生問題、但終無良好辦法、今羅稅務司雖仍無正式收受「華興劵」之公布、惟事實上江海關已實行以「華興券」爲折合標準、</p>
<p>日員强佔　各收稅處</p>
<p>日商橫濱正金銀行、於昨晨八時、調派大批日籍人員、赴江海關中央銀行收稅處、以及所屬郵局及海關碼頭之兩辦事處、實行接收辦理收稅事宜、各處由江海關水巡捕房日籍警員嚴密戒備、收稅處四週馬路上、由租界捕房派中日西探捕駐守、所有中央銀行收稅處之人員、因收稅處已爲日籍人員所强佔、被迫停止至收稅處辦事、各處門首懸有「江海關監督」之折合行市牌、</p>
<p>實際目的　在於加稅</p>
<p>「江海關監督公署」昨日公佈之海關金折合「華興券」、以及法幣折合「華興券」行市如下、海關金一元、等於「華興券」二元五角三分二厘、「華興券」一元、折合法幣一元五角五分、如以法幣繳納關稅、則爲三元九角二分五厘合海關金一元、故此决之改、以「華興券」爲標準、實爲變相之增加稅收、幾達百分之五十至六十、例如前日法幣二元五角五分六厘合海關金一元、昨日已增爲三元九角二分五厘合海關金一元、</p>
<p>拒絕關金　劵等行使</p>
<p>日商橫濱正金銀行昨在收稅處貼中日英三種同樣公告云、「爲佈告事、查本行即日起僅收日商銀行·華興商業銀行·外商銀行所發之本票、及上述各銀行擔保付款之支票、凡付關稅及海關諸收入之超過法幣一百元者、一律須繳上述各種本票或支票、仰各商人全體遵行、此佈、民國二十八年九月一日、」對於信用素著之十足凖備關金兌換券、及華商銀行之本票支票、竟予以拒絕行使、</p>
<p>中行稅員　被迫撤退</p>
<p>前日（八月三十一日）各進出口商聞江海關將改用「華興券」、紛向中央銀行收稅處繳稅、所以是日之稅收、至下午九時、始行完竣、稅收驟增、共的國幣二百餘萬元、及至下午九時完竣後、稅務司羅福德派員、將收稅處之鑰匙收去、昨晨、中央銀行收稅處全體人員一百餘人、欲赴各處辦公、見處內已爲日籍人員所强佔、不得已由沈主任領率、返中央銀行上海分行、報告被强佔經過、靜待局長之命令、</p>
<p>昨已電渝　總行報吿</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、中央銀行上海分行、對江海關稅務司提出之收受「華興券」辦法、堅決拒絕後、昨日已將收稅人員被迫撤退之經過情形、急電重慶向總行報吿、同時並通知總稅務司梅樂和、並於收稅處同人堅決反對收受「華興券」、昨日均集中中央銀行上海分行、靜候局長之調遺、聞是項收稅人員、均係受過稅務之相當訓練、與普通收款人員不同、均有特別之收稅技能、</p>
<p>總稅務司　未有所聞</p>
<p>關於總稅務司梅樂和、對於江海關改以「華興券」爲標準一案、事前並未得該關稅務司羅福德之呈報、亦未奉中國政府財政部之命令、事後亦未得到正式報告、並聞中國當局對江海關稅收、改以「華興券」事、深爲訝異、財政部已請英國外交使節團轉向英大使詳詢一切、</p>
<p>接收後之　收稅情形</p>
<p>又新聲社記者昨會數度赴江海關收稅處及郵局分辦事處、（一）江海關稅收處、昨日上午、並無一人前往繳納、下午繳納者、均以法幣及外商銀行本票及支票繳付、（二）郵局分辦事處、昨日上午十一時以前、祇收受各免稅郵件、十一時後、郵件之繳稅、均以法幣付給之、未見有持所謂「華興券」者、但所繳之稅、昨日與前日相較、巳增加百分之五十强、</p>
<p>照常公佈　關金行巿</p>
<p>關於中央銀行發行之關金兌換券、至二十六年底截止、發行額爲四〇九·六三〇·七〇、係以現金爲十足準備、查海關金單位、於民國十九年二月一日起施行、先對進口稅實行徵收金幣、凡海關進口洋貨、無論其原價爲何種貨幣、概須依照規定比率、折成海關金單位、其應納關稅、概以關金計算、昨日中央銀行公佈之海關金單位、爲關金一元、等於法幣二元五角六分五釐、</p>
<p>影響英美　在華貿易</p>
<p>英美進出口正當商人、一對於江海關改用「華興券」爲標凖、頗爲重視、因實行之後、變相增加稅收、故均認爲影響對華之貿易、况英美各國在華之銀行、如匯豐·花旗、麥加利等、對「華興券」、均拒絕收受、故聞英美商人或將有所表示、此後之上海對外貿易、恐將受重大之打擊、</p>
<p>各業拒絕　華興僞幣</p>
<p>上海各銀行錢荘及錢兌莊烟兌店等、對於「華興券」問題、屢奉財政部命令拒絕收受、所以「華興券」迄今、祇能在虹口區域及其佔領區域行使、公共租界蘇州河以南及法租界、並未有「華興券」發現、聞各業方面、此後決依照政府命令、堅決拒絕收受、所以昨日向江海關繳稅者未有持「華興券」繳納</p>
<p>工部局巿政銀行　收受活定存款</p>
<p>工部局巿政銀行定於九月一二四五日（星期五六一二）收受活期存款、每年給息五釐、收款處爲江西路二〇九號該局總辦公處內財政處公債銀行股（第二五七號辦公室）、又該行在每日辦公時間內、依照工部局布吿第四九一一號之規定、收受定期六個月及十二個月之存款、定期六個月者年息五釐、定期十二個月者年息六釐、凡欲探詢詳情者、可向工部局財務處接洽、</p>
<h3>訂購貢米可使　食糧有備無患　蕢延芳氏盼望各界續訂　米店門售依然抬高五元</h3>
<p>虞洽卿發起之民食維持會、自委託會計師公會舉辦訂購洋米登記以來、全市各工商團體、粉往塡表訂購、昨日計有上海貧兒院五十包、上海市冰鮮魚行業伺業公會二百包、共計二百五十包、總計一週間共達三千九百八十六包、因近日米價暴跌、故多數觀望、</p>
<p>蕢氏仍盼　續訂洋米</p>
<p>大光社記者以連日米價暴跌、各業對訂購洋米、頗多意存觀望、昨訪晤蕢延芳氏、叩詢意見、據告、本人與虞洽卿先生等、前以滬市食米來源被阻、米價飛漲、民食問題、形成空前嚴重之局面、故經集商結果、决定發起訂購洋米、以資接濟、第一步先勸告各大工廠商號訂購、使存底得有凖備、則米價可望遏平、値此外匯緊縮之時、吾人明知訂購洋米、容有未當、但爲接濟民食維持治安、亦屬迫不得已之權宜辦法、現幸滬市米價已逐步趨跌、但仍盼各業能繼續踴躍訂購洋米、雖其價格或較國米爲高、各業未免吃虧、但實際上可使本業各友食糧充足、不再與升斗小民爭食、則市民可得賤價之食米、其功德豈有涯涘云、</p>
<p>米價昨又　續跌一元</p>
<p>昨日河下到貨計八船、共一千六百三十石、而上市者除此一千六百三十石外、行家亦有三千一百七十六包求售、故市塲仍呈供過於求狀態、故米價又續跌元許、最高白粳二十七元、本秈二十二元左右、糯米因非大宗食糧、已跌至二十八元、四日間已跌去十餘元、但市價依然看跌、</p>
<p>米店門巿　售價仍高</p>

<h3>天津四華人命運　尙無確實音訊　滬英按署電津發傳達書　瓊思推事前日秘密聽訟</h3>
<p>大陸報云、天津四嫌疑犯案件、星期三日上海英大使館接天津英領署通知、謂接英政府命令、業已採取將嫌疑犯移交日當局之步驟、代表四犯之本埠愛理思律師公館瓊斯氏、鑒於事件緊急、乃向英國按察使署再度呈請、昨日（三十一日）午後、由推事瓊思在辦公室聽訟此案後、午後四時許、決定發傳達書、立即電達天津英當局、請說明爲何拘禁其所覊據疑犯之理由、</p>
<p>四人命運　仍屬疑團</p>
<p>英政府之命令、是否業已實行、發英國司法是吾勝利、昨日深夜、仍屬疑團、此間英大使館人員等、待四犯已吾引渡之天津覆電已久、至昨夜七時、猶無昔訊、衆意覆電將於今（一日）晨到達、推事瓊思昨在辦公室中聽訟、極爲秘密、對於關心是案而往探詢者、告以推事瓊思不在按署、此案若聽訟、將於九月四日、由推事莫肅爵士受理等語、</p>
<p>英政府對　此案責任</p>
<p>據向英大使館某員叩詢、若傳達狀發出後、竟將各犯移交、則英政府須負何種法律上之責任、該員指稱、英政府僅通知而非命令天津英租界當局交出四人、若遵此通知而行、政府不能負責、若該通知遭拒絕、則爲證明英國司法嚴正之事實云、傳達狀將於九月十一日在此問辯論、聽辯者或係今自日本避暑返滬之推事莫肅爵士、傳達書係發致天津英軍指揮官羅業爵士、羅氏或不致親自來滬出庭、但將派法律上之代表、</p>
<p>瓊思聽訟　突如其來</p>
<p>八月二十三日英政府發令致天津英當局後、愛理思律師公館所取營救嫌疑犯之手續、隨時報告此間英大使館、推事瓊思昨日聽訟此案、突如其來、甚至昨夜大使館對於該案已經聽訟、抑於今日舉行、亦未確悉、按英方移交四人、天津僞法庭必須發拘捕狀、要求英當局引渡、並須經過英方作更進一步之引渡手續、而後交出諸犯、</p>
<p>英按署已　定期辯論</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、關於天津英當局所覊禁四嫌疑犯之目下命運、今（一日）晨未能在滬獲得正式證實消息、此閒英按察使署推事瓊思、、昨日（三十一日）傍晚前已發出傳達書、請天津當局說明其所羈嫌疑犯何以加以拘禁之原因、上海愛理思律師公館瓊斯氏今晨聲稱、請發保護人身法令狀將於九月十一日在英按察使署中辯論、</p>
<p>審理尙有　一綫機會</p>
<p>此即表示現被覊禁之四人、苟非咋日之傳達書抵津過遲、則在被引渡予天津日當局之前、復有提出此案由英按察使署審理之機會、瓊斯雖暗示僅倫敦能對此事發直接命令、惟截至午前爲止、上海尙未接得四人現遭何方羈禁之電訊、</p>

<p>發生衝突　八名受傷</p>

<h3>「社會棟樑與人民公敵」</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>在科舉時代的讀書人，確實相信書中自有黃金屋，書中自有萬鍾粟，書中自有顏如玉……等等的讀書目的論的。目的論離不了功利論的觀念，讀書的最後目的是爲的利祿，這是過去讀書人中大部分人的中心觀念。雖曰奉侍國家，但老實設還是爲的一人一家一族。因此在「才子」一類的舊小說中，每多窮書生十年窗下，先則落魄京華，可是忽然金榜有名，皇上御試，揷過金花，游過紫禁城之後，第一樁事便是奉旨完姻，實現了『書中自有顏如玉』的初步階段。接着便是魚肉鄉民，廣置田屋，接連着實現了『黃金屋』和『萬鍾粟』。那時的讀書人，目標是頗單純明瞭的。求智的策勵，就是道幾句書中自有……　中自有</p>
<p>今之『書官人』雖然剪掉了辮子，但却並沒有剪掉了個人的功利論。因此今日的教育目的雖在造成爲國爲社會奉侍的國家幹材，社會棟樑，但在大部分的『官人』心目中，依舊脫不了「書中自有」的觀念。我們且不談僅有能力（當然指財產的能力）讀了一個童生或秀才資格的小學或初中學生；在現階段文化狀態下的中國，這輩人却正形成着社會運用機能中的一個齒輪。我們且看財力有升學高中大學的靑年，他們的作文和論文中，也許高談着爲國服務等等的話。可是中國雖大，社會各方面所需要的人才雖多，然而今之讀書人所願服務的事業却並不多。海關招考—『趨之若騖』，郵局招考—『趨之若驚』，文官考試和航空學校招考起來也還是『人材濟濟』，但除了不多幾個視爲金飯碗的機關外，餘者雖同是國家機關—或性質上更重要的，雖也均有人滿之患，然而恐非我們今日讀書人的野心所指。因爲多數社會事業的待遇，如果使你能養得起黃臉婆，住得起亭子間，吃得起白米飯，已經好透好透。然而靑年人是有野心的。</p>
<p>我們不反對野心，不，我們贊助靑年人上進的野心。但我們實不忍看這種野心的所指只在謀和黃臉婆離婚後去討『顏如玉』，從『亭子間』搬進『前樓』，或甚至住洋房，銀行中有意外的存款。</p>
<p>『某人自某地回來後，從前的亭子間已經不住了，聽說還新買了許多傢生……同學某某某某最近在某地十分得法，發了財……』像道樣的話，在『某某』云云的親友們聽來也許會感到沾了「餘光」，（我不僅一次二决的聽得這種說法，而且還有着這種親友呢！）但在我却不禁想到易下生的『社會棟樑與人民公敵』一個劇題了。</p>
<h3>東綫展望</h3>
<p>— 聖日</p>
<p>—戰地追記</p>
<p>東錢的戰事，從六安淪陷以後，便轉岑寂了。蘇家埠除由少數省保安隊防守以外，僅留　　師的步兵一營在那里，而且霍山，葉集，跟西界嶺等處，也沒有多少軍隊。因爲道時武澳外圍的爭奪，已入最後的嚴重階段，當然沒有餘力來窺探大別山脈的偏門，所以東綫便呈現着靜止的狀態。但八月下旬，風雲驟緊了，狄人由楊柳店跟韓擺渡兩路同時人犯，照例先濫放大砲，繼以鐵甲車衝鋒。守軍一面沉着堵截，一面飛電乞援，拚命地保守着原有的陣地。然而「好整以暇」的保安隊，却始終作壁上觀，也許是愛惜子彈的緣故，連槍械『珍藏』起來了；及至事後查究，便以「未奉命令」爲卸責理由，要不然，對方是準會『片甲不回的』。</p>
<p>我們出發東綫的早晨，正　山雨欲來，遠峯近岫，都吞沒於烏黑的密雲中。從槐樹灣到鵝毛嶺的一段山路，崎嶇險峻，僅容一騎，任老教授控着那匹黑驢的繮繩，眞會使你記起八仙故事中的張果老來。我們原準備趕到麻埠宿夜的，但雨越下越大，只得在小馬店打尖了，這里距獨山還有六十里，預計耍明天下午才可到達。據農民們說，飛機已經屢次來偵察過，但還沒有投過彈。任老教授便抓住這個機會，打開了話匣子似的，和他們談話起來。</p>
<p>明天拂曉，仍繼續東進，淸晰的砲聲振起了我們的精神。及至麻埠，街上是冷淸淸的，商鋪祇開了半扇門，據說比較殷實的人家，早巳躱進深山去了，這皖西首屈一指的大鎭，便被戰氛包圍着，顯出了異樣的情調。越過香花嶺，由前綫退下來的受傷戰士，用破布裹着滲透血蹟的創傷，在艱苦地步行着，沒有輸送車，也沒有担架床，使爲國拚命的戰士受着額外的痛苦，這是多麼的悽慘啊！</p>
<p>到了兩河口，知道迅速增援的結果，前錢已很穩定了，「要不是生力軍來得快，石婆店就靠不住，」大家都這麽說。其實對方的襲取蘇家埠，本沒有向西深入的能力，如果保安隊能够同時出擊，東錢是安如磐石的；何况對方的西進，原是試探性質，假使眞是進犯的話，以我們的估計，至少要配備一師團兵力，才可以冒險一下，在兵源已感恐慌的侵略者，怎麽有嘗試的膽量呢。</p>

<p>三郎先生再鑒：續　奉悉期六外，每日下午五時。　編者</p>
<h3>相學</h3>
<p>— 嚴豁</p>
<p>舊社會對於一個人的相是非常講究的。立有立相，坐有坐相，自然睡有睡相，吃也有吃相。</p>
<p>小時候，性子頑皮，坐立不端，父母便常常會板起面孔來駡道：「看你這副輕骨頭的相貌罷，將來是一定不會有出息的！」這呌做；「三歲定八十，八歲定終身。」肚子餓了，吃起東西來當然要狼吞虎嚥，立刻「相」又來了：道成什麽體統呀？眞是窮相畢露！」</p>
<p>和這相反的有所謂「富相」，俗名呌做「財神相」。對於道種人的相貌，我因爲見得太少，不敢瞎說；但從字義推斷起來，大概總是臉孔圓團團，兩個耳朶也很大，和廟裏所供的財神菩薩相差不遠罷？</p>
<p>一個少女，走在路上，臉上笑眯眯，身子有些兒扭動。看見的人倘是命相家，那他就會滿不高興，像煞有介事的說：「妖形怪狀，生就的蕩相！」然而倘若臉色顯得太認眞些了呢，也會招致不平的，這時是：「裝腔作勢，好一副死相！」</p>
<p>立直着走在路上的女人如此，在一般的女人以下曲着背的人們則更是「定相論」的好對象：賤坯的相固然不必說了，連骨頭也是賤的——黑奴在古人筆記裏被記載着除肌膚以外，血肉下的一層也永遠不白，甚至不灰，不管證據與吾，這種表面現象直透內在本質的「非皮相」之論，的確可使人吃一大驚。然而事實也有，例如：靠洗衣服度日的苦老婆子底手非常粗糙，善於奔跑的拉車夫底脚瘦而且大，他們很平常，都是註定了的罷。這在「手相學」「脚相學」中也是一種好的補充：他們的苦不出頭，那是糟糕的手和脚之累也。據此，摩登女郎底蔻丹和斯文相公的襪套，自然也用不着了。</p>
<p>最近某報的把希特勒和墨索利尼底手照相製了銅版，公佈於世，來標榜「手相學」，也是很似有道理的。但可惜的是，瞧瞧希氏（或墨氏）底手也不見怎樣滑如柔荑，相反的倒也粗糙得很，和拉車夫的差不了多少，道或許他以前在幹漆匠營生時太多動了手的緣故罷（墨氏早年也在街上搶過麵包）；然而某報手相學家終於鑒定這隻手確確實實是偉人的手：這條是什麽紋，那根是什麽路，連他吞併捷克波希米亞（或阿比西尼亞與阿爾巴尼亞）都能够從這個上看出來——粗糙嗎？不粗糙的！一手掩盡天下人之目，相擊萬歲！</p>
<p>其實，相學萬歲原不必靠少數人來大吹大擂，一些街頭的英雄們早已奉行不渝了，你要去領教，他準給你顏色看，帽子一歪，手一又：「喂！朋友識相點！」——這粗糙得很，相書上或許無載，但也是相學之一。</p>
<p>嗚呼，相學萬歲！</p>
<h3>向著自由的路前進</h3>
<p>— 雲龍作</p>
<h3>山水</h3>
<p>— 古丁</p>
<p>山黃春天的，水是秋天的；但是，春天應該玩水，秋天應該逛山。山是屬於少年的，水是屬於老年的；但是少年和老年都會領略山和水的趣味。譬如我自己，山和水一般珍視，山和水一般喜愛。偶爾在神聖似的大建築物的尖端，望見白色的烟，便感到山間的情趣。也有些時候，坐在大理石的檯面旁邊，嚮往着水的神韻。我總覺得烟是屬於山的，風是屬於水的；霧是屬於山的，雨是屬於水的。山間的烟霧，水而的風雨，不是我故意誇說，實在是把人世間的一切情緒，一切空氣，都象微無遺了。</p>
<p>兩年來沒有游山玩水，雅興也早被風塵烟火，　蝕殆盡了。記得有一位詩人說過：『游山是銀鍊身體，游水是銀鍊思想。』我却以爲他說對了一半。我是喜歡水甚於山的，但是不得不承認山間也有詩境。法國有一首古歌中說：「山的妻子是水，「那末山是男性的，水是女性的了。夫妻的情境有時會在兩性的溶化中，產生一個平衡。</p>
<p>生活在都市裏，旣沒有山，又沒有水。愛山愛水的慾念，也漸漸變了態，變成了「占有」的貪生了。人人有「占有」的意念，但也有「欣賞」的情志；二者的强弱全在眼外的景色。都會的五味鍋和山間水面目然不同。有人以爲山水是逃避現實的避藏所；實在山水是「銀鍊」人類的好塲地！詩人的『游山是銀鍊身體，游水是鍜鍊思想」，不管一半對，還是完全對，多少總有一些眞理存在吧。國家民族的生命，不在花花綠綠的都市，而在叢山流水之間。都會能在片刻之間，化爲灰燼，而山水却眞能與日月長存。允其我們古老的國家，對山水的厚愛，更是深切。雖在戰鬥的時代中，山的崇高，水的洪流，也代表着我們古國的精神呢！</p>
<p>在內地工作的朋友，每决來信必提起山水的勝景。這對我，未始不是一種示威；可是我寗願屈服在這示威之下。在五味鍋裹煎炸得也够了，卽使紙上的三言兩語，也可以望梅止渴的滿足一下我的山水夢。不是嗎，我常常會沉在昔日游踪的回憶中，重嚼肩頭的舊夢。至於味道的甜酸苦辣，恕我沒有辨得淸楚，無以奉吿了。</p>
<p>『像你這般年紀，應該跑到山間去工作。』有人這樣說。是的，我不但這般想，幷且還希望駕一葉輕舟，往洋面飄去呢！朋友，尊意如何？</p>

<h3>新艷秋章遏雲與侯玉蘭</h3>
<p>— 鐸</p>
<p>近來不論票友戲子之習旦者，莫不以程派是尙。第習之而能得其竅奧，悟其三昧者，則如鳳毛麟角。有之，唯三人，皆爲坤伶；一曰新艷秋，一曰章遏雲，一曰侯玉蘭。新艷秋原名王玉華，民十七初决來滬，隸丹桂第一臺，一唱而紅。當時爲伊操琴者，係伊胞兄。伊兄昔日曾隨程硯秋，其琴淸脆流利，頗爲人賞識。玉華所以學程，耶此關係。當時坤伶多學梅蘭芳，玉華以一十七歲小女子，獨宗程腔，唱白俱脫女子尖音，即表情做作，亦均神似，無怪一嗚驚人。二十二年二决來滬，聲價十倍，藝亦猛晋。嗣在南京與其宗師程硯秋同時演唱，呌座力竟並駕齊驅。惟後此遭遇多舛，迭爲環境磨折。去冬在北平吉祥戲院，更受重大刺激。現避居天津，不知何日重現於紅氍毺上。世途艱險，我不禁爲一般坤伶危也。</p>
<p>章遏雲聞名在新艷秋之後，惟資格經騐，均較新伶爲高深。初無籍籍名，後因聘穆鐵芬爲琴師，唱腔改宗程硯秋，於是一唱而聞名全國。遏雲之衷氣較遜於玉華，惟唱腔淸脆流利，有琤琮之音，確爲特長。更佐以穆鐵芬之琴，唱二簧及反二簧戲時，悽其愴凉，如泣如訴，彷彿哀猿悲鳴，唱來碎人心魄。遏雲之臺步，亦十分漂亮，行路時輕盈似燕，足微工夫之深。做作自然，惟嫌過於隨便，遠不若硯秋之端重。而學硯秋者，獨不可不重視硯秋之端重也。</p>
<p>侯玉蘭以北平戲曲學校第一名高材生，此决隨言菊朋南來，初决獻藝於黃金。該校旣爲硯秋所辦，其學生之習旦者，自必多宗程派。玉蘭係吳富琴之高足，富琴隨硯秋已久，硯秋之唱白做作，唯富琴知之最爲精微，玉蘭受富琴之薰陶，復常得硯秋之親自指導，是其學程必較玉華遏雲爲深切。更以其本人潛心用功，故成績優異。此决南來，不佞曾往聆數决，覺其藝確屬不凡。嗓較遏雲爲高，與玉華相似，翻高腔時，直干雲霄。並善用腦後腔。衷氣頗足。白口無拖音，是其獨創，惟女孩兒音尙未全脫。做作身段，敏捷中帶端重。水袖工夫漂亮瀟灑，較遏雲玉華爲佳。允以一對眸子，淸瑩如水波，最爲動八。扮相嫵媚秀麗。惜乎齒雖齊而不甚皓，能戲不多，臺步工夫尙淺。預料將來二决來滬，必有意外之進步，而獲得無上之榮譽也。</p>
<p>此三人以遏雲年最長，玉華次之，玉蘭最雅。三人中學程之經過，以玉蘭最親易。遏雲因得穆鐵芬之佐助，學之亦較有遵循。至於玉華，前曾一度有拜硯秋爲師之意，惟硯秋爲避嫌疑起見，婉言却之，故玉華之學程，全賴伊之聰慧，潛心摹擬而得，爲三人中最困難者。論三人之藝；以太華學程最爲神肯，惟年來迭經磨折，恐將减色。遏雲唱做俱優，惟欠端重。玉蘭年最幼，藝亦臻上乘，雖尙有缺點，祇耍再求改進，將來希望無窮也。</p>
<h3>「影聯」第二個戲　誰是陳白露</h3>
<p>— 代尼</p>
<p>——藍蘭？徐天任？黎揚</p>
<p>張石川主持的「影聯」昨天起在辣斐劇塲啟演了。正是預定着的曹禺三部曲—雷雨，日出，原野，從頭演起。每個戲演一星期。現在「雷雨」上了。「原野」是不必重排的，因爲中法演的時候，都是國華的演員，如舒適的仇虎，周曼華的金子，蒙納的焦大媽，周起的常五，祇是喬奇的大星有問題，不過僅僅調動一個演員，是沒有什麽大關係的；並且是第三個戲，可以從容不迫。現在急於在趕排的是「日出」。陳白露一角已經和藍蘭談妥，可是璇宮重演「花濺淚」藍蘭在「花濺淚」中是飾米米，一邊還在趕藝華的「女子公寓」，在急促之間或許沒有分身的時問。於是陳白露一角叉落到徐天任身上，她是從前的中央攝影塲的演員。不過據筆者昨天得到的消息，叉從徐天任而在接洽黎揚了。黎揚就是「職婦」公演一女子公寓」中的陳佩佩郁鍾馥。同時未名社的「上海之歌」也擬請黎揚演袁金花一角，那是因爲「職婦」從前本想演這個戲，並且由「上海之歌」作曲者張昊排練多時，可以駕輕就熟。可是「職婦」定於二十四日要公演四個小戲，黎揚或許也是分不開身的。</p>
<p>陳白露是誰？現在還是個謎。</p>
<h3>「花濺淚」重演感言（下）</h3>
<p>— 于伶</p>
<p>記得李健吾先生這樣說過：劇本一經定成，公之於世，它就不僅是作者個人的，而是社會的了。因此我想祇消它的演出，於社會有點意義，能盡些戲劇的藝衛任務，收些演劇的社會效果的話，即使是一幕半幕也總比不演爲好的</p>
<p>這决上海劇藝社在　宮劇院怱怱開幕，適値「八一三」租界戒嚴加緊，致觀衆不便夜出；接着是國際風雲險惡，上海生活激變，加之秋熱加常，以致營業不振，屢換新戲，影響劇社排戲進行的步序，不得不重演「花濺淚」等來作調劑，準備中秋節邊的「撒謊世家」「柳暗花明」和「戀愛與陰謀」等新作。萬一因着「花濺淚」的重演，對於劇社能盡點些微的轉機作用的話，那將是我意外的光榮了。我熱烈地企求着：不是爲「花濺淚」，而是爲劇藝社，或者恕我誇大點說爲孤島受難的演劇運動！</p>
<p>可以吿慰觀衆的是上海劇藝社在艱難中進步着。導演吳永剛先生叉恰巧剛把「花濺淚」改編成電影脚本，準備秋後拍攝。今决重排，可以代我改正原來的劇本和過去演出方面的不少缺點。由於若干角色的調動，也使「花濺淚」的陣容爲之一新。多承讀者不棄，「花濺淚」劇本已行銷了兩版。帶着許多先天的缺點的所謂作品之傳開，在我是非常不安的。去年首决演出，臥病未能看全，以致再版也未修正。這决四慕完全演出，也許足以鼓勵我彙集歐陽予倩唐槐秋二先生在香港用國語與粵語兩决演出的批評意見，作待印的三版本的修正吧！</p>
<h3>派拉蒙重攝「萬世流芳」</h3>
<p>— 保羅</p>
<p>「萬世流芳」“Beau　Geste”一片，曾經轟動一時，係根據惠倫斯爵士的名著攝成，現在派拉蒙影片公司特地重攝，由賈萊古柏，雷密倫等擔任主角，於九月一日在紐的公映。</p>
<p>這一本萬世流芳，是派拉蒙巨片年中最偉大的一部，其他尙有五十七部影片，由全體導演，演員一致出動，全年制造預算規定三千萬美金。其中却爾斯勞頓主演的“Jamaica　Inn”考爾門主演的“The　Light　That　Failed”桃樂賽拉瑪主演的“The　Disputed　Passage”由名著搬上銀幕，都是値得一提的。</p>
<p>此外更有一部五彩卡通片格立佛遊記，足以媲美白雪公主，也是派拉蒙偉大貢獻之一。至於已經完成，由西席地密爾導演的鐵馬“Union　Pacific”一片，在秋凉以後，就要與上海人士相見了。</p>
<p>舞國寫影（三八）</p>
<p>— 小田</p>
<h3>星六星紀之九——沈維英</h3>
<p>詩云，巧笑倩兮，美目盼兮。我說這兩句詞，好像是沈維英的寫照。維英最好看的一種姿態，是從遠處緩緩行來，眞個是珊珊蓮步，嬝娘柳腰，令人望而生愛。及至近前坐定了呢，未免耍遜色些。但是再進一步，同她交談幾句呢，保管你聽了她的嚦嚦鶯聲，必定要感到一種舒服勁，跳的舞也輕，的確是舞星中一個上選之村。</p>
<p>（三八）　有一部份人，說維英架子太大。但是，做舞女能够擺架子嗎？不是存心跟鈔票作對嗎？我想維英是聰明人，決不會這樣做。果然，她對於一班花錢的客人，非但不擺架子，並且隨時隨地，有意無意之間，都會即景生情，抓些甜言蜜語來奉承幾句。不過對於一班揩油朋友，就不肯假以詞色了。你想，她們出來當舞女爲的是什麽，不是爲的是掙錢維持生活嗎，那末如果不給錢的客人豈不成了寃桶了麽。</p>
<p>嘗見有幾個舞女，東也吃豆腐，西也吃豆腐，不是洋琴鬼，就是小抖亂，再不然結交些唱申曲雜耍的朋友，自以爲是光榮，及至風聲遠佈，化錢的客人，都不免望風而逃，於是偶然碰着個瘟大爺，就不免要死命的指上一下，但是指上一時，指不了一世，結果，紅星變成紫星，紫星就變成黑星了，那時間這些不三不四的朋友，也就瞧你不起了，弄得一天到晚，東奔西逐，臭不堪言，嚮時吃慣人家豆腐的人，這時送給人家吃豆腐，人家還不希罕呢，眞是可憐不足惜，何苦呢。沈維英是個眞的聰明人，也許她能見到這一層，她那架子是擺得有地方的，你們別小看了她了總之，你不寬人，人不寬你，你若專門玩美人，拿人當寃桶，結果吃虧的，還是你自己，這就呌因果報麼，若常站在旁觀的地位上瞧瞧，倒也可說絲毫不爽呢。</p>

<h3>Hitler Issues Declaration; Determination to Burn the Boats; War Will Not Stop Until Victory is Achieved; Successor Designated in Case of Mishap</h3>
<p>Berlin – The German Reichstag convened at 10:00 AM this morning (5:00 PM Shanghai time) at the Kroll Opera House. After a brief speech by Speaker Göring, Führer Hitler delivered a declaration amidst an atmosphere that was initially silent and then filled with thunderous applause. He first mentioned the Treaty of Versailles, stressing that it was the root cause of various intolerable situations. He then reported on the 40 incidents of conflict that had occurred since last night, stating, "I have now decided to use the methods of the Poles against the Poles themselves." Hitler mentioned Italy, expressing gratitude for Mussolini's support of German demands for several weeks. He then said, "But you, members of the Reichstag, should know that I do not ask others to support our country's conflict with Poland. Between 1919 and 1920, more than one million Germans were forced to leave former German territory. This time, I attempted to seek a peaceful revision based on a consistent policy. Rather than betraying the attitude of millions of Germans, I lodged a protest with Poland. Unexpectedly, Poland rejected it and responded to the German proposal with mobilization. Today, German-Polish relations can no longer be resolved through fair negotiations. Poland has no intention of realizing the minority rights that we consider natural. For four months, I have been quietly observing the evolution of the situation in Poland, and I have repeatedly warned them. Three weeks ago, I warned the Polish ambassador that if Poland continued to oppress Germans in political, economic, and customs matters, the German government would find it difficult to sit idly by. Today's Germany is by no means the Germany before 1913, and it cannot be compared at the same time."</p>
<p>Hitler then mentioned the British mediation efforts over the past few months, declaring, "We waited quietly for two days until last night, when we received a Polish reply stating that they were considering whether they could discuss the German proposal. If we could be treated in this way, then Germany could withdraw from the political stage. My love of peace is by no means a sign of weakness. Therefore, I decided last night to notify Britain that in the current situation, Poland has no inclination to negotiate, and mediation efforts have obviously failed. Poland's response to the German proposal was, first, general mobilization, and second, increased terrorist activities. Forty incidents occurred last night, so I have decided to apply the methods of the Poles to the Poles themselves. If Western politicians believe that German-Polish relations endanger their interests, then Germany can only express regret. But we have no demands on the Western powers, and we will have no territorial issues in the future. I have repeatedly proposed friendship proposals to Britain, but this must be a mutual expression and cannot be one-sided. The western border of Germany has been resolutely decided, and this attitude will never change. European countries have recognized this attitude, for which I am grateful, especially to Italy. But I will never ask foreign countries to support Germany in its war efforts." (The audience applauds enthusiastically.) "Germany will respect the neutrality of all countries that maintain absolute neutrality. As for the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, although the national policies of the two countries are different, they both know that if a conflict occurs between the two countries, a third country will inevitably benefit from it. Therefore, they concluded a non-aggression pact, eliminating the possibility of conflict between the two countries, and are mutually conducting economic cooperation negotiations. This matter is of very great importance for the future. I believe that the German people will welcome it, because in the First World War, Germany and the Soviet Union fought each other, and the result was that both were victims of the war. This time, we must not repeat the same mistake. Now the agreement has been approved simultaneously in Berlin and Moscow, and Molotov's words have been fully supported by the Soviet government." At this point, Hitler returned to the Polish issue, declaring that this action seeks to resolve three issues: (1) the Danzig issue, (2) the Corridor issue, and (3) the issue of permanent German-Polish peace. "I have decided to fight until the Polish government is willing to understand. I will never fight against women and children, so I have instructed the air force to only target military objectives." Hitler then said that Poland had begun to attack last night, and at 5:45 AM this morning (approximately 1:00 PM Shanghai time), the German side also began to retaliate. "From now on, we will respond to bombs with bombs. I will continue this war until Germany obtains its rights." Since the Nazi Party came to power six years ago, it has spent 90 billion marks on national defense, so today the German army has become the strongest force in the world. At this point, Hitler stated in a heroic tone, "I have put on the uniform of the Great War again, and I will only take it off after victory is achieved. I will devote myself to this cause, whether I live or die. If I encounter a mishap, General Göring will succeed me as Führer. If he also suffers misfortune? Hess will succeed him. If Hess has a mishap, then the Senate, which I appoint today, will decide on a candidate. I hope you will pledge your loyalty to him as you do to me." Hitler continued, "The word 'surrender' does not exist in my dictionary. The events of November 1918 will never be allowed to repeat themselves in German history. Anyone who opposes this national order, directly or indirectly, will be executed. We will never allow traitors to exist in the country." Hitler then ended his speech, urging members of Parliament to stay at their posts and fulfill their responsibilities to the country, and to inform German women to abide by discipline. Hitler then reiterated his creed that he began to fight for the Nazi movement: "If we have a firm determination, then no difficulty can change our original intention." After Führer Hitler finished speaking, the audience applauded thunderously. General Göring then stood up and declared that the Minister of the Interior, Frick, would present a bill declaring the return of Danzig to Germany. Frick then stood up and read the bill, which was unanimously passed by all members of Parliament. General Göring then paid tribute to Führer Hitler on behalf of all members of Parliament, and assured that all members of Parliament would always be the Führer's backing, and for the future of Germany, for the honor of Germany, would not hesitate to overcome difficulties and be determined to sacrifice to achieve the goal. His conclusion was roughly: "I am deeply confident that Germany will be able to achieve final victory." (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<h3>Danzig Declares Annexation into German Territory</h3>
<p>Danzig – Forster, the Nazi Party leader of Danzig and head of the Danzig government, officially announced this morning the abolition of the constitution of the Free City of Danzig and requested annexation into German territory. Forster sent a telegram to Führer Hitler, the content of which is as follows: "To Führer Hitler, this morning I announced the abolition of the constitution of the Free City of Danzig and signed the constitutional essentials for the annexation of Danzig into Germany, which are as follows: (1) The constitution of the Free City of Danzig is now abolished, and this constitution shall take effect immediately; (2) the judicial and administrative powers of Danzig shall be dispatched by the head of the Danzig government; (3) the territory and residents under the jurisdiction of Danzig shall belong to Germany; (4) before the implementation of German law in Danzig, all other laws, except the constitution, shall remain in force. On behalf of all the citizens of this city, I humbly request Your Excellency to approve this constitution and implement the annexation of Danzig." Forster also issued a message to the citizens of Danzig this morning, stating, "To all men and women of Danzig, for twenty years, all of us in Danzig have been eagerly awaiting the return to Germany, and our long-cherished wish has finally been achieved today. Danzig has today returned to Greater Germany. Führer Hitler has freed us from our fetters. The Nazi "卍" flag is flying in the wind on top of the Danzig government office for the first time. The men and women of Danzig should shake hands and celebrate our liberation today, and express our loyalty to Führer Hitler and jointly build a bright and splendid Greater Germany. Long live the merger of Germany and Danzig, long live Germany, long live Führer Hitler, September 1, 1939, Forster." After this news was sent out by telegraph this morning, the whole city was overjoyed, and the celebrations were unprecedented. National flags flew throughout the city, and the people paraded in teams, with songs and cheers resounding endlessly. (Haitong News Agency, 1st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Germany Opens Fire on Poland</h3>
<p>"...Since 5:45 this morning, we have opened fire..."</p>
<p>German Führer Hitler made this announcement of opening fire while addressing the German Reichstag on the German-Polish issue yesterday, September 1st. Is this not a deformed declaration of war by Germany against Poland? Is this not the death knell for European peace? Or is it the signal for the opening of the Second World War? What about the European war? What about the world war? How will it affect the Far East? All these questions have long lingered in the minds of everyone; and now, after the German Führer's announcement of opening fire, the pursuit of answers to these questions must be pressing. Everything can either be foreseen or is difficult to predict, and cannot be generalized; what is easy to know concerns the Far East, and what is difficult to predict concerns the changes in the world; this newspaper is unwilling to make irresponsible discussions to readers about how it will be.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation after Germany opened fire on Poland, it is unfolding in many ways, detailed in the news section. As of this morning when the reporter holds the pen, there are four relatively important pieces of news that I would like to suggest here: (1) Britain announced general mobilization, (2) France announced general mobilization, (3) The Polish ambassador to Britain verbally notified the British authorities that Germany's act of aggression against Poland had violated the terms of the British-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement, (4) The US Reconstruction Finance Corporation stated that after the outbreak of the European war, US goods exported to Britain and France would be paid for by the Export-Import Bank, and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Export-Import Bank would not be restricted by the "Johnson Act." These four should be regarded as (1) Poland expects British assistance, (2) Britain and France have implemented the last step before their operations, and (3) the United States is preparing to assist Britain and France from an economic standpoint. In addition to this, there are extremely important matters for which there is still no news, please reveal:</p>
<p>(1) The German army and air force have already invaded Poland, and both Germany and Poland have this telegraphic dispatch. At the same time, all parties claim that Germany and Poland have begun confrontational actions; however, Poland has not been heard to begin its frontal resistance war against the invading enemy forces;</p>
<p>(2) After learning of the German Führer's speech, Britain still asked the question, "Is this speech that I am declaring war on Poland?" It has not been asserted that its ally has been invaded, nor has it been heard to immediately launch assistance to Poland;</p>
<p>(3) Italy is Germany's military ally, and the night before last it still expressed to France its willingness to make mediation efforts. Now the German army has attacked Poland, and the German Führer has announced the opening of fire, but it has not been heard how Italy will place itself;</p>
<p>(4) The Soviet-German non-aggression pact has some positivity, and now that one of the parties to the treaty has announced the opening of fire, it has not been heard what the Soviet Union has expressed.</p>
<p>We should pay the most attention to these four; how the war situation will unfold in the future will shift depending on the content of this news; and what the content will be is not what we should predict today.</p>
<p>History often cycles but not necessarily. Although the lessons given to us by the First World War are extremely rich, we cannot hastily use all the lessons of that time to weigh the present and the future. This is with regard to the politics, economy, and strategy of various countries. The various kinds of past and present are different, and the progress of the air force will surely create a new situation in modern warfare, and this is regardless; a question can also be set here, namely "If the German army were to occupy Danzig and the Polish Corridor, what military strategy would Germany take against the British and French armies? What diplomatic strategy would they take against Britain and France?" The possible answers to this question are not known in total, and the unimaginable situations in the future are not known in total, not to mention that there are many problems. Then, instead of predicting the elusive future, why not closely monitor the evolution of facts?</p>
<p>As for the Far East, it is a part of the entire world and will naturally be affected by the inseparable impact of the European situation. However, in terms of the essence of the Far East: the key to the Far East lies in whether Japan fundamentally abandons its policy of aggression against China and whether it withdraws its aggressive troops. If Japan does not stop its aggression, China will definitely not stop its resistance. Japan obtained a golden age economically during the First World War, but the current aggression against China and the second golden age cannot be obtained simultaneously, although this is not something that the Japanese can consider today, but in fact there is a worthy question to consider; China can only resist and seek survival, there is nothing to consider. Japan's military needs are taken from Europe and the United States, but now the sources in Europe have been cut off due to the European situation, and the sources in the United States cannot be maintained for long due to the United States' abolition of the treaty, and the Soviet Union's Far Eastern Railway has never been used to transport military supplies for Japan; this, on the Chinese side, is quite different from Japan. In short, whether Japan abandons its policy of aggression due to the European situation is another question, but there is no doubt that China will not stop its resistance due to the European situation. Furthermore, in terms of the environment of the Far East: if the European situation is like this, then the intentions and actions of the United States and the Soviet Union will increase their ability to affect the Far East; from this point alone, it can be seen that the aggressor countries in the Far East must not be able to obtain special opportunities in the Far East due to the European situation.</p>
<p>What is happening today is only "opening fire" on Poland by Germany, and expanding it into a European war, and into a world war, is naturally a development in the imagination, but exhausting the wisdom and strength of the world, why is there no hope of preventing a spark from starting a prairie fire!</p>
<h3>US President Urges Five Countries to Take Humanity into Account and Not Bomb Civilians; Whether to Convene a Special Session of Congress Depends on Whether the German-Polish War Expands</h3>
<p>Washington – According to sources in the White House, President Roosevelt is temporarily reserving the issue of invoking the Neutrality Act or convening Congress. President Roosevelt now feels that before the United States takes this serious step, the European war will advance beyond the scope of the German-Polish border fighting. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt made an urgent appeal today to the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, asking them to declare that they would not, under any circumstances, bomb civilians or undefended cities from the air. The telegram reads, "In the past few years, during wars in various parts of the world, civilians in undefended centers have been cruelly bombed from the sky, resulting in the mutilation and death of thousands of defenceless women and children, and deeply shaking the conscience of humanity. If, in the current catastrophe facing the world, this is used</p>
<h3>US Prepares to Extend Loans to Britain and France, Unrestricted by the Johnson Act</h3>
<p>Washington – Jones, Chairman of the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation, recently told reporters that when the European war breaks out, the export of US goods to Britain and France will be paid for by the Export-Import Bank, and both the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Export-Import Bank are not restricted by the Johnson Act. (According to the Johnson Act, countries that have defaulted on their war debts to the US cannot borrow from the US again.) (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Inhumane and barbaric means of warfare will result in the tragic deaths of countless creatures, including birds and animals, who are in no way responsible for or even involved in the current war. Therefore, I make this urgent appeal to the governments of nations that may participate in the war, asking them to publicly declare that their armed forces will under no circumstances bomb civilians or undefended cities from the air, and to ensure that all opposing countries will adhere to the same rules of war. I respectfully request an immediate response to this appeal.” (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington – Regarding the news of the German army invading Poland, the US Ambassador to France, Bullitt, and the Ambassador to Poland, Biddle, both reported to President Roosevelt via telephone at 2:50 this morning. The President immediately conferred with Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Welles on the phone. Hull and Welles also went to the State Department at 3:00 AM to convene a meeting of senior officials. During the meeting, Secretary of State Hull frequently used long-distance calls to contact Ambassador Bullitt in France and Ambassador Kennedy in Britain. The meeting resulted in a decision to first appeal to the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Poland, and Italy not to bomb undefended cities by air. At the same time, President Roosevelt also notified the national army, navy, and air force that a state of war had formed between Germany and Poland. However, according to White House sources, the President has no intention of immediately convening Congress for a special session to invoke the current Neutrality Act and formally declare the establishment of a state of war between Germany and Poland. As for how much time the President is waiting for to "immediately" convene Congress, this will be clarified when he meets with reporters this morning. In addition, President Hitler's speech in the German Reichstag today was listened to intently by the President on the wireless radio. The German High Command announced today that "German troops are counterattacking on the Polish border." This news has been reprinted by the local newspapers without any commentary. However, the newspapers have all issued extra editions with headlines such as "German Troops Invade Poland" or "German Planes Bomb Polish Cities." Furthermore, there are rumors circulating that the Panama Canal has been closed, and ships from all countries except the United States are not allowed to pass. Local officials have denied these rumors, saying that they have not heard of such a thing and that the government has not taken such measures. So far, only destroyer squadrons have been dispatched to the Canal Zone to strengthen defenses. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>British Ships in the Far East Gather in Singapore, Preparing to Return Home</h3>
<p>Singapore – All British ships east of Singapore have been ordered to proceed to Singapore before heading west. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Poland Asks Britain and France to Fulfill Mutual Assistance Treaty, British and French Cabinets and Parliaments Hold Meetings</p>
<p>London – A spokesman for the Polish Embassy in London announced today that the Polish Ambassadors to Britain and France have separately notified the governments of their respective countries that Germany has invaded Poland, and therefore the alliance treaties signed between Poland, Britain, and France have come into effect. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London – The British Cabinet met this morning, and both Houses of Parliament are scheduled to meet at 5:00 PM today. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Paris – The Cabinet held a State Council meeting at 6:00 PM today, presided over by President Lebrun. Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet presented detailed reports on the international situation. Afterwards, according to an official announcement, the State Council unanimously decided to fulfill France's treaty obligations. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Paris – The Senate and Chamber of Deputies are scheduled to hold extraordinary sessions tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London – After the outbreak of hostilities on the German-Polish border, local officials declared that "if President Hitler's speech this morning is to be considered a declaration of war by the German government against Poland, then we must respond that Britain and France are also fully determined to fulfill their obligations to Poland. The German account of the negotiations is clearly inconsistent with the facts. To our knowledge, President Hitler notified the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, on the 29th of last month that he demanded that the Polish government send plenipotentiaries to Berlin the next day to discuss a solution, a tactic reminiscent of how Germany dealt with Czech President Hacha this spring. In short, the Polish government, without knowing the content of the German government's proposed terms, was still forced to send representatives to Berlin to accept them. The Polish government would not accept such a humiliating position. Even when a victorious country presents peace terms to a defeated country, it is customary to allow the peace delegates to consult their own government. As for Britain's attitude, it can be summarized in a few words: If the German government is truly sincere in resolving the current dispute through negotiations, it should not adopt such an arbitrary procedure but should follow the normal path of civilized governments, exchanging views with the Polish government and first agreeing on the location and date of negotiations. Instead, they resorted to coercion, which Poland rightly rejected. Furthermore, the German government's sixteen proposals were not delivered to Poland in a timely manner. The British government believes that no matter how mild the content may be, Poland must be given time to fully consider whether the proposals conflict with its vital interests, especially since the German government had previously stated in a note to Britain that it was willing to respect Poland's vital interests."

<h3>German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact Ratified: Hitler's Attitude Suddenly Hardens, Saying Poland Refuses Direct Negotiations and Does Not Accept Sixteen Demands</h3>
<p>Washington - According to diplomatic observations here today, there must be some kind of secret agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany. The sudden ratification of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union last night must be for some reason. Political circles here believe that the European situation has now entered a more dangerous stage, but it is not yet hopeless. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union met this afternoon and immediately unanimously approved and ratified the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to an official announcement here last night, the German government has approved the German-Soviet agreement. This announcement coincided with the decision of the Supreme Soviet in Moscow to ratify it. (Haitong dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin - At 9 p.m. last night, the German government published the official document of Germany's proposal to Poland. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"On August 28, 1939, the British government informed Germany that it was prepared to mediate the German-Polish dispute and stated that, in view of the frequent border incidents and the tense European situation, the British government believed that an immediate resolution was necessary. Although the German government still expressed doubts about Poland's sincerity at the time, because Britain came forward to mediate, it submitted a note on August 29, stating that in order to maintain peace, it was prepared to accept the British proposal and emphasized that if a crisis was to be avoided, action must be taken quickly. The German government was willing to receive a specially appointed plenipotentiary representative from Poland before midnight on August 30 to conduct negotiations, but that representative must not only discuss the dispute but also have the authority to conclude an agreement. Once the representative arrived in Berlin, the German government would inform them of the basis for German understanding with Poland. However, the German government did not receive any notification of the arrival of a Polish representative, and only heard the news of Poland's general mobilization. Late at night on the 30th, Britain informed Berlin that London was willing to do its best to facilitate the start of negotiations. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then told them that Germany was prepared to present the details to a Polish plenipotentiary representative. The next day, the Polish ambassador to Germany visited the foreign ministry and confirmed that Poland had not appointed the ambassador or any other person as a plenipotentiary representative. Therefore, the German government waited in vain for two days and could not but consider the proposal to have been rejected. At the same time, it was considered necessary to inform the people of the content of the proposal to Britain. Before submitting the following sixteen points of proposal, Germany believed that the current relationship between Germany and Poland was very tense, and both sides' troops were heavily concentrated on the border. Any incident could cause armed conflict. If efforts were to be made to resolve the issue peacefully, a long-term solution must be sought so that similar incidents would not cause similar crises in the future. Therefore, the root causes of the current situation were sought to be found in two reasons: first, the arbitrary demarcation of the Treaty of Versailles; second, the unfair treatment of ethnic minorities in the ceded areas. In order to correct the above two errors, the German government proposed the following sixteen points:</p>
<p>(1) The Free City of Danzig is purely Germanic in nature, and its residents unanimously wish to merge with Germany, and should be returned to Germany immediately.</p>
<p>(2) The so-called corridor area, starting from the Baltic Sea and including the cities of Marienwerder, Graudenz, Kulm, and Bromberg, should be decided by its own people, whether to merge with Germany or Poland.</p>
<p>(3) In order to decide the issue stipulated in the second point, a civil vote should be held. All Germans who have resided there since January 1, 1938, or who were born in the area before that date, should have the right to vote. The voting shall be handled by an international committee jointly formed by Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and Italy. The committee shall be similar to the organization during the Saar region vote. Polish military police and authorities shall withdraw from the voting area within a short period of time.</p>
<p>(4) The port of Gdynia is not within the scope of the vote. Although the port is a Polish seaport, its border shall be determined by Germany and Poland through negotiations, and if necessary, it may be delimited by an international arbitration court.</p>
<p>(5) In order to prepare all procedures in order to obtain a fair civil vote, this vote will be held twelve months later.</p>
<p>(6) During this twelve-month period, traffic between Germany and East Prussia and between Poland and the Baltic Sea shall be guaranteed without restriction. Railways and highways shall only charge the minimum maintenance fee.</p>
<p>(7) The future fate of the area shall be determined by the majority.</p>
<p>(8) In order to ensure traffic between Germany and East Prussia and between Poland and the Baltic Sea after the civil vote, if the people of the corridor are willing to merge with Poland, Germany shall be allowed to build a traffic area with extraterritorial rights between Butow and Danzig or Taush, with a highway and a four-track railway, one kilometer wide. If the vote results in favor of merging with Germany, Poland shall also be allowed to build a highway and railway between it and the port of Gdynia, which shall also be designated as a "traffic area with extraterritorial rights."</p>
<p>(9) If the corridor merges with Germany, Germany is willing to handle the exchange of the Polish population.</p>
<p>(10) If Poland wants to obtain certain privileges in Danzig, it must be based on fair principles, and Germany must also obtain the same privileges in the port of Gdynia.</p>
<p>(11) Neither Danzig nor Gdynia shall be equipped with military facilities and shall remain purely commercial ports.</p>
<p>(12) Regardless of the outcome of the civil vote, the Hel Peninsula should be converted into a demilitarized zone.</p>
<p>(13) Complaints raised by Germany and Poland regarding ethnic minorities shall be investigated by an international committee. Germany and Poland are willing to compensate each other for economic losses from the other party since 1918.</p>
<p>(14) The two countries shall negotiate an agreement on ethnic minority issues, stipulating that ethnic minorities have the right to maintain their national customs and cannot be forced to serve in the military.</p>
<p>(15) If an agreement is reached based on the above proposals, Germany and Poland shall immediately demobilize.</p>
<p>(16) All steps to reach an agreement shall be determined by direct negotiations between Germany and Poland. (Haitong dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Germany Announces the Course of Negotiations, Britain Says It Does Not Conform to the Facts, and the Sixteen Demands Are Not a Reply to Britain</h3>
<p>London - The panic of a European war reached its highest point last night. Although Britain has already generally mobilized, it still hopes for peace. The British army, navy, and air force completed mobilization within hours last night, and the whole country is in a state of war, preparing to cope with emergencies. British officials still hope that German-Polish negotiations can be realized and are now waiting for Poland's reply, proceeding with negotiations according to German conditions, or Poland's statement in a note to the United States that Poland is prepared to negotiate with Germany on an equal footing. After Poland expresses its attitude, Britain will try to approach Germany again. Authoritative sources here claim that the German sixteen points were sent to Poland on Thursday and cannot be regarded as a reply to Britain. Britain has not yet received a reply from Germany to Britain's recent proposal. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London - After the German government put forward sixteen proposals on the Polish question last night, British officials commented, "The German government's proposal is not a reply to any British proposal. The British government's view is well known to the world, and its purpose is to promote the resolution of German-Polish disputes through negotiations rather than through force. Therefore, what the British government is committed to is to ascertain whether the governments of Germany and Poland can conduct negotiations, but there are three conditions: (1) Both sides must conduct negotiations on the basis of equality. (2) Any solution must safeguard Poland's main interests. (3) Full guarantees must be obtained for the respect of the binding level. As for the sixteen proposals put forward by the German government, they were sent to the Polish government for the first time this afternoon through diplomatic channels. British Ambassador to Germany Henderson visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop last night, and the foreign minister read out the proposals, but did not formally hand them over to Ambassador Henderson, only saying that Germany insisted that the Polish government send a representative to Berlin before midnight on September 30 to conduct negotiations. This deadline has expired, and the Polish representative has not yet arrived, so the above proposals have not been submitted. In the British government's view, the German proposal has been fully published by the German News Agency, which shows that it is formal in nature. The Polish government is the main country concerned, and before the country has discussed it in detail, Britain is not in a position to express any opinion." (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Paris - After the German government's sixteen proposals were suddenly published yesterday, sources close to the government here revealed that Sir Kennard, the British ambassador to Poland, advised Foreign Minister Beck on the 30th of last month to agree to direct negotiations with Germany. The French Foreign Ministry also instructed its ambassador to Poland, Noël, to visit Foreign Minister Beck late that day and make the same recommendation. By the morning of yesterday, the Foreign Ministry received a reply from Ambassador Noël stating that Foreign Minister Beck had notified by telephone that the Polish government had decided to accept the advice of Britain and France and had instructed its ambassador to Germany, Lipski, to meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to inform the German government of Poland's agreement to direct negotiations. Unexpectedly, German Foreign Ministry Director Weizsäcker inquired of Ambassador Lipski beforehand whether the meeting with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was in the capacity of an ambassador or a plenipotentiary representative. Lipski immediately replied that he was visiting as an ambassador. Then, at 9 p.m. yesterday, the German radio station published the sixteen proposals put forward by the German government and pointed out that the Polish government had failed to send a plenipotentiary representative to Berlin as scheduled to conduct negotiations, which showed that the Polish government had rejected the proposal. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington - The documents published by the German semi-official agency, the German News Agency, have been commented on by people close to the State Department, who said that this is a strategy aimed at alienating Polish and British-French public opinion and seeking a favorable observation of the German position by the world. However, if the leader Hitler still puts forward unilateral preliminary conditions before conducting negotiations, the whole problem remains. In addition, Hitler's leader is using the immediate recovery of the city of Danzig as a condition for negotiations, and the sixteen proposals he has put forward may not be what Poland is willing to discuss. In short, the past events of Germany's encroachment on Czechoslovakia can serve as a warning. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin - Leader Hitler issued the following proclamation to the national defense forces this morning in the name of the supreme commander of the German army, navy, and air force: "The proposal I put forward to resolve the disputes with neighboring countries by peaceful means has been rejected by Poland. On the contrary, the country is now engaged in resolving it by force. The Germans in Poland are being threatened by cruel terrorist activities, and border incidents are endless, all of which prove that Poland has no intention of respecting the German border. In order to stop this intolerable situation, I have no other way but to respond to force with force. The German national defense army will carry out the glorious struggle with the greatest determination to maintain the rights of the revived country. I am convinced that every soldier will always uphold the reputation of the German army, be loyal to his duties, and remember at all times that you are representatives of National Socialist Germany and have high hopes. Long live the German nation, long live the country, Hitler in Berlin, September 1, 1939." (Haitong dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Commanders of the German Army, Navy, and Air Force Address Their Soldiers</h3>
<p>Berlin - Air Minister General Göring recently issued a letter to the air force soldiers, saying, "Air Force warriors, we have endured provocative actions for months, and now we can no longer endure it. Our compatriots have long been abused in Poland, and now we can no longer endure it. Leader Hitler has issued a call, and the decisive moment for our country and our nation has arrived. Our country's air force must show its strength and fulfill its responsibilities. You must not fail the trust of the leader. Know that the only solution at this time is victory." (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin - Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder recently issued a letter to the navy soldiers, saying, "The navy is ready to defend the honor, rights, and freedom of the motherland. We have a glorious history and have unwavering confidence in the leader and the German nation. We should go to war calmly." (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London - According to observations here, Poland is surrounded by Germany on three sides, namely the west, southwest, and south. The west and southwest sides are flat, which is conducive to the German army's offensive, while the south is a mountainous area, which is conducive to the Polish army. The major German military strategy is to launch a two-pronged attack on Poland's industrial area, that is, the military supply area. According to this, the area is in the Krakow area in southwestern Poland, but the German army must also attack from Slovakia at the same time to divert Poland's attention. (American Electric Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Moscow - The joint meeting of the Soviet Union's Federal Council and the National Council was held in the Kremlin tonight, and immediately discussed the third item on the agenda, the issue of ratifying the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Treaty. There were many participants, and there were no empty seats except for the diplomatic box and the seats for Soviet and foreign journalists. When Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, Mikoyan, Zhdanov, Khrushchev, Beria, Malenkov, Sheyev, and the chairmen of the Supreme Soviet committees and the people's commissars attended, the whole place stood up and cheered to welcome Stalin and his comrades. Then, Andreiev requested Comrade Molotov to make a report on the ratification of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. Molotov stood up and delivered a speech that lasted for an hour. The listeners were moved and cheered from time to time, which proved the general enthusiasm for supporting the Soviet Union's peace policy. After Molotov finished his speech, Deputy Spambakov stood up and said that Molotov's speech had fully clarified the Soviet Union's foreign policy, so there was no need for debate. According to Deputy Spambakov's motion, the two houses voted separately to decide to support the government's foreign policy and ratify the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Treaty signed on August 23 of this year. (TASS dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Moscow - Molotov gave a speech on the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact at the Supreme Soviet today, saying, "Comrades, since the third plenary session of the Supreme Soviet, the international situation has not improved, on the contrary, it has become more tense. Although the governments of various countries have tried to eliminate this situation, their efforts are not sufficient or effective. This is the case in Europe and in East Asia. Japanese troops still occupy major cities and a small part of the territory of China. In addition, Japan continues to engage in hostile actions against the Soviet Union. In this situation, the conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact has important and positive value, because it can eliminate the crisis of war between the Soviet Union and Germany. In order to fully explain the significance of this pact, I must first analyze the negotiations conducted in Moscow by the representatives of Britain and France in the past few months.</p>
<p>"Comrades all know that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union on a pact of mutual assistance against aggression in Europe began in [April] of this year. Comrades also know that the British government's initial proposal was completely unacceptable to our country, because it completely obliterated the main prerequisite for such negotiations, namely the principle of mutual obligation and equality. However, the Soviet government did not reject the negotiations for this reason, but only put forward its own proposals, because we deeply know that it is not easy for the governments of Britain and France to suddenly change their policies, which until recently were unfriendly to the Soviet Union, and to engage in solemn negotiations with our country on the conditions of equal obligations. Later negotiations also did not produce good results. After four months, only a few issues were clarified, and at the same time, the representatives of Britain and France realized that the Soviet Union is a country that must be taken seriously in international affairs. However, the negotiations ultimately encountered insurmountable difficulties, and not on individual "programs" or clauses of the draft pact, but on other more serious causes.</p>
<p>"If the conclusion of the pact of mutual assistance against aggression is to be effective, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must reach an agreement on practical military steps to resist the aggression of aggressor countries. Therefore, for a period of time, not only political negotiations, but also military negotiations were conducted in Moscow with British and French representatives. However, these military negotiations also did not produce results, because Poland, which should have been jointly guaranteed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, refused Soviet military assistance. Although efforts were made to overcome this repeatedly, it was not effective. Moreover, the course of the negotiations proved that Britain not only had no intention of overcoming Poland's opposition, but even encouraged it. Since Poland's attitude was such, the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union were obviously hopeless. Later, we realized that the negotiations were destined to fail.</p>
<p>"The course of the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union shows that the positions of Britain and France contained many clear contradictions from beginning to end.</p>
<p>First, on the one hand, Britain and France demanded that the Soviet Union provide military assistance to Poland when it was invaded. As you all know, the Soviet Union sincerely accepted this demand, but Britain and France should provide the same assistance to the Soviet Union. On the other hand, Britain and France colluded with Poland to resolutely refuse Soviet military assistance. Since assistance was considered unnecessary and coercive interference, how could a pact of mutual assistance be established? Secondly, on the one hand, Britain and France provided the Soviet Union with guarantees of military assistance against aggression in return for the same assistance from the Soviet Union. On the other hand, they attached reservations to their assistance regarding indirect aggression that were sufficient to make it a phantom and added legal excuses to avoid providing assistance and trap the Soviet Union in an isolated position against aggressors. What is the difference between this kind of "pact of mutual assistance" and a deceptive pact? Thirdly, on the one hand, Britain and France especially pointed out the importance of negotiations on a pact of mutual assistance, thereby demanding that the Soviet Union pay special attention to it and quickly resolve all issues related to the pact. On the other hand, Britain and France themselves showed an extremely perfunctory and casual attitude towards the negotiations, only sending second-rate figures as representatives without any real power. For example, when the military representatives of Britain and France arrived in Moscow, they did not have any real power, and did not even have the right to sign any military treaties. (Laughter) What is even more serious is that the British military delegation did not even have any proof documents. (Laughter) After the request of our country's military delegation, they submitted proof documents on the eve of the breakdown of negotiations, and even these documents were very vague, that is, they did not have the proper authority. What is the difference between this kind of casual attitude of Britain and France and a deliberate game of negotiations, and intentionally turning the whole thing into something worthless?</p>
<p>The fundamental contradiction in the attitude of Britain and France was the main reason for the breakdown of negotiations. There is a fundamental reason why Britain and France are so contradictory. On the one hand, the British and French governments are afraid of aggression, and therefore hope to establish a pact of mutual assistance with the Soviet Union, but only to the extent of strengthening their own power. On the other hand, the British and French governments are afraid that the conclusion of a pact of mutual assistance will make the Soviet Union stronger. This kind of fear seems to outweigh all other considerations. We can only start from this point to understand the truth of the actions of the Polish state under the instructions of Britain and France. (To be continued) (TASS dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Parliament Passes Military Service Bill: Voroshilov Makes Military Report</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union met this afternoon and immediately passed in principle the bill proposed by National Defense People's Commissar General Voroshilov. The content is to extend the term of compulsory military service for infantry, air force, and border guards by one year. The original term of service for infantry was two years (youth). The age of enlistment has also been changed from 19 to 18. University students who were originally allowed to be exempted from military service have also been canceled. Therefore, 135,000 university students can be enlisted this year. After the implementation of this bill, the number of standing troops can be greatly increased, but its main purpose is to increase technical personnel and cadres. The age limit for officers has also been reduced. The age of lieutenants has been reduced to below 40 years old, and the age of brigade commanders has been set between 50 and 60 years old. In addition, the term of reserve troops will also be extended. Sergeants and soldiers could be discharged after serving from the age of 18 to 21, but now it has been changed to 50 years old, still as the first-level reserve soldiers, and trained once every year and a half. Lieutenants are trained once every two years, and other officers are trained once every three years. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union immediately appointed General Voroshilov, Air Force Chief of Staff General Loktionov, Army Chief of Staff General Shaposhnikov, and 35 others to form a committee, chaired by Ukrainian Communist Party Secretary Koroshko, to sort out the provisions of the bill and submit it for a vote again. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Moscow - The joint meeting of the Federal Council and the National Council of the Soviet Union was held in the Kremlin today. Voroshilov reported that "the new universal conscription law is used to replace the old law passed nine years ago. According to the old law, the defense of the Soviet Union was purely by laboring people, and non-laboring people were responsible for other auxiliary national defense work. At present, exploiters have been excluded, and workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals have been fused into a laboring common front. Stalin's constitution has given every Soviet citizen equality." Voroshilov continued that in the past nine years, the strength of the Soviet Red Army and Navy has increased threefold and a half. The increase in this kind of strength is because the Soviet government, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and Stalin have solemnly considered the international situation and believed it was necessary. Voroshilov continued, "Our country is a special country. Our country is surrounded by hostile capitalist countries. Therefore, in terms of defense, this socialist country only relies on its own strength." Then Voroshilov reported on the strength of the Red Army and Navy, saying, "Compared with 1930, the number of technical equipment of the Soviet army is as follows: the number of tanks has increased 43 times, the number of aircraft has increased by 556 percent, the number of heavy and light artillery has increased by 592 percent, the number of small-caliber flat-fire artillery has increased 70 times, and the number of heavy and light machine guns has increased by 439 percent. In 1930, the mechanical power per person was 3.07 horsepower, but at present, the strength of the Red Army and Navy has increased three and a half times, and the mechanical power per person has also become 13 horsepower. The current tonnage of the navy has increased by 130 percent compared with 1930." Voroshilov concluded, "No matter how fast the international situation changes, the Soviet Union can cope with it calmly. Those who cannot recognize the Soviet Union will continue to be taught a lesson. The armed forces of the Soviet people will inflict great wounds on all enemies who attempt to infringe on the sacred rights, territory, and honor of the Soviet Union. (TASS dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The new Soviet Ambassador to China, Pan Aojin, presented his credentials to Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government this afternoon and addressed Lin Sen, saying, "I hereby express the sincere friendship of the Soviet Socialist Federation to the Chinese nation and express our deep sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Chinese people for national independence. The Soviet people firmly believe that the great Chinese nation will achieve final victory. Since the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, mutually beneficial cooperation has been carried out in political, economic, and cultural aspects. Although the Soviet Union adopts a peaceful policy in this extremely chaotic international situation, it always provides friendly assistance to countries that are being invaded. The Chinese people and their government must know that the Soviet Union's various aids to China's heroic war are not just empty words, but facts. My mission now is to develop and strengthen the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union." After the Soviet ambassador finished his speech, Chairman Lin immediately replied, "China and the Soviet Union have the world's longest common border, and the people of the two countries are bound together by sincere and natural friendship, and this friendship has recently been strengthened by the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet trade agreement. Since your Excellency's mission to China is to develop and strengthen the friendly cooperation between the two countries, it will surely be beneficial to both parties. In this arduous and sacred struggle, China has not only received the unlimited sympathy of your country, but also received a lot of material assistance from your country, which proves that the Soviet Union's position is indeed anti-aggressor. This point makes the Chinese government and people deeply believe that they will surely achieve a glorious victory." (1st AP dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Ambassador to the United States Discusses the Nine-Power Treaty Principles and Continues to Maintain Them</h3>
<p>Washington: The newly appointed British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, told reporters today that Britain's Far East policy will continue to be based on the Nine-Power Treaty and will not change. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance was canceled because of the Nine-Power Treaty. If the development of the Far East is to be discussed, it must be based on the Nine-Power Treaty. When a reporter asked whether there was a possibility of renewing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Lord Lothian replied that it was a matter of twenty-five years ago. In the past twenty-five years, the situation has changed greatly, and the Nine-Power Treaty has replaced the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.

<h3>Japanese Experts Observe the Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to some Japanese experts working in the Chinese army and the Chinese government, speaking to an AP reporter, the Abe Cabinet will inevitably be a short-lived cabinet. According to them, Abe is a second-rate military man and a third-rate liberal. His decision to be appointed as prime minister is enough to show the internal contradictions within Japan's war machine. Because Abe is a second-rate military man, he cannot control a small group of soldiers, let alone control the young officers in North China. Also, because Abe is a third-rate liberal, it is difficult to put Japanese politics on the path of liberalism. Since the Japanese elder statesman Saionji and others declared the anti-communist agreement dead, although they hope that Japan can change its course, a person like Abe can be judged to have no way to do it. Furthermore, the conflict between the Abe Cabinet and the Japanese military is now very obvious. For example, the Abe Cabinet's foreign policy is trying to win over Britain, France, and the United States, but the Japanese army in North China is intensifying its blockade of the British concession in Tianjin. At the same time, the leaflets dropped by Japanese planes in the western part of China all said, "The British in the Far East have been conquered by Japan. Chinese people should not fantasize about the help of the British." Such contradictions exist. Therefore, it is predicted that the life of the Abe Cabinet will be at most half that of the Hiranuma Cabinet, in other words, three months. (1st AP dispatch)</p>

They were dealt a head-on blow, and eight boats were sunk, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers. In addition, in the Zaoshi area, Chinese troops encountered Japanese troops in Shujiazhai, destroying many Japanese cars. They are now taking advantage of the situation to advance towards Tianmen. The Chinese troops in southern Hubei have been launching fierce attacks on Yangxin for several days, successively capturing Cikou Town, Yangxin City, and Leifengjian strongholds, and thoroughly clearing the remaining Japanese troops around the county seat. The Japanese troops in the city are closing their doors and defending themselves. The Japanese troops in Kangcun and Zhan Village in northern Henan (both east of Wuzhi) have been besieged by Chinese troops for several days, and both places have been captured. The remnants of the Japanese army fled to Boai, and after taking advantage of the victory to pursue, they divided their forces to besiege Qinyang, making rapid progress. The Japanese troops in Wen County have been invading Beiwangjiacun for several days, engaging in repeated battles with the Chinese troops.

<p>Chongqing: There is great concern here about the floods in North China. It is reported that the entire province of Hebei and northern Henan and western Shandong are now a vast expanse of water, and the continuous rain in Shanxi Province is also worrying. This flood is said to be the worst in eighty years, with millions of people homeless. The area between Beiping and Baoding is completely a large lake, submerging fourteen county seats. Coupled with the disruption of transportation, the situation is unclear. Government officials are now planning relief measures, allocating funds, and calling on charitable organizations to assist. According to reports, the flood-affected areas are all occupied by the Japanese army. However, the central government is still expressing concern, as the Xinhua Daily said, that although the land has been occupied, the people are still compatriots.

<h3>The Japanese Navy's Dilemma (Continued)</h3>
<p>In the narrow waters of the China Sea and the Sea of Japan, submarines may have a destructive effect on Japanese commerce if Japan cannot take appropriate countermeasures. Although there has been great progress in combating submarine warfare, it is still ineffective without both personnel and naval vessels. Japan does not have naval vessels that can carry out a very effective anti-submarine war on the sea routes it needs. To begin with, the sea route from Japan to Korea and Shanghai is longer than the sea route connecting Europe and the United Kingdom, so it is more difficult to carry out effective patrols. In addition, the Chinese coastline is suitable for submarine warfare. Effectively patrolling the coastline and curbing Chinese activities against Japan are extremely difficult tasks; a large number of Japanese light cruisers, destroyers, and small warships are needed in the China Sea and the Sea of Japan. The importance of submarine warfare should not be underestimated. A look at the distribution of naval power in the Far East shows that submarine warfare is a factor that all naval authorities in the Far East keep in mind. The British Empire's most powerful independent submarine fleet is based in Hong Kong, consisting of fifteen of the largest submarines with long endurance. It is well known that the Soviet Union has an important submarine fleet stationed in Vladivostok. The Netherlands also has an excellent submarine fleet in the East Indies.</p>
<p>Warships that attack in the outer seas should be selected from the cruiser class. Japan's potential enemies, except for the Soviet Union, all have well-organized and elite fleets of cruiser-class ships. Britain alone has no fewer than sixteen cruisers in or near the Pacific, all of which are modern. Although Japan has thirty-seven ships, including five old ships under 4,500 tons. These British warships have great power when attacking, and if they fight against Japan, they will have the effect of destroying Japanese trade. Of Japan's total of thirty-seven cruisers, most must be retained to perform normal duties with the battle fleet in the country, and a larger portion of the remaining cruisers must be engaged in anti-submarine activities and general patrols in the seas between China and Japan. The number of cruisers left to be sent to the outer seas is very small, only enough to collect tolls on enemy trade but not enough to protect Japan's own overseas trade.</p>
<p>The next question is what significant factor will the Japanese battle fleet reach when it ventures to invade the Speed ​​Zone. The answer is that the purpose of a battle fleet is to enable the owner of the fleet to gain an advantage in the designated theater of war. Japan's battle fleet has nine warships, most of which are stationed near Japan. For example, when the battle fleet is stationed there for a long time, it can carry out patrols and other actions that are vital to Japan's survival within 1,500 miles around without being seriously hindered by the enemy cruiser fleet. If most of the battle fleet is not stationed in the area from Japan to Taiwan, then the patrol fleet will be seriously hindered by the enemy cruisers, which are of a type with an average speed of nine or ten knots higher than Japanese battleships. It is unlikely that Japan's six battleships will leave near Japan. It is conceivable that the other three battleships (warships designed before the war) may be used to counter attacking warships and escort expeditionary forces. However, all three ships are old and have poor armor, and in a real war, they are not a match for any three of Britain's fifteen battleships.</p>
<p>The following conclusions can be drawn from the above brief overview.</p>
<p>(1) Since there is a country with a huge cruiser fleet, the danger of a powerful Japanese invasion of countries far from Japan is very small. Japan cannot succeed in invading distant lands without suffering significant losses to its trade. Even if trade has already suffered significant losses, distant invasions cannot be completed until Japan has solved the problem of enemy ship attacks. The purpose of dealing with attacking enemy ships will seriously consume all of Japan's naval power.</p>
<p>(2) A submarine fleet attacking Japan will be most effective in the most concentrated Japanese sea lanes near or near Japan. Due to the threat of submarines, the number of warships available for expedition will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>(3) Even if there is no hostile battle fleet in Singapore at the start of the war, Japan will not dispatch a huge battle fleet far from its home ports because the enemy has a huge cruiser fleet, which will force most of the Japanese battle fleet to remain in Japan.</p>
<p>(4) If Singapore has a hostile fighting fleet, for example, limited to four ships, it will be enough to keep the entire Japanese battle fleet in the area from Japan to Taiwan, if not all of them, then almost all of them.</p>
<p>(5) Australia has one battleship on both sides, which is unlikely to provoke a military operation of an invasion nature because such an action seems extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>(6) The British naval war defense strategy in the Pacific is to avoid fleet action. As long as it does its best to keep the enemy navy on its own soil and destroys the enemy's maritime trade and military escorts, it will be effective.</p>
<p>(7) Adding a battleship to Australia's defense fleet is of great benefit, but since more urgent needs have not been met, Australia does not necessarily need to obtain a battleship. This should be a goal for the not-too-distant future, and preliminary preparations should be made now. (End)</p>

<h3>British Military Officer Spears: Still No Hope of Release; British Government Seems Not Very Concerned About This Case</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports from Beijing on August 18th: Lieutenant Colonel Spears, British military attache in China, has been detained by the Japanese army and held in Kalgan for twelve weeks now. The British government and the public do not seem to be showing much concern for the fate of this British officer. In these three months, the British government has not only been unable to rescue him, but also unable to have him "tried" soon, or to improve his conditions of detention. The Japanese authorities in Kalgan have always used the excuse that the case is still under investigation to delay the "interrogation." Others cannot help but think that even the busiest affairs must have completed their preliminary investigation by now. If Lieutenant Colonel Spears were a Japanese national, arrested in England for a real crime, he would have been tried long ago, and would have been allowed legal assistance from his compatriots. The Japanese authorities have repeatedly stated that the Kalgan military district is under the jurisdiction of General Sugiyama, commander of the Japanese forces in North China. Since Sugiyama's headquarters is in Beijing, why can't the British government have Lieutenant Colonel Spears transferred to this city, where he can receive much better treatment in terms of accommodation? During this long period, all the British government has been able to obtain is permission for a low-ranking British military officer to visit Lieutenant Colonel Spears in Kalgan. On August 12th, Captain Parker, a British interpreter stationed in Japan, flew from Tokyo to Beijing, and on the 14th, flew to Kalgan. Major Hennessey obtained permission from the Japanese headquarters in Beijing to accompany Captain Parker. Many people thought it would be more appropriate to send a higher-ranking military officer, such as the British military attache stationed in Japan, but Major's Parker's trip seems to have been approved by senior officials in Tokyo only after a long and difficult negotiation. Furthermore, this trip was permitted only under strict understanding, that the visitors must speak to Lieutenant Colonel Spears in the presence of a Japanese who understands English, and must not discuss the case with Lieutenant Colonel Spears. If the British government is currently taking steps to secure his early release, these steps must not be discussed either. Therefore, it is not surprising to ordinary people that Lieutenant Colonel Spears initially refused to see the two military officers, on the grounds of "what's the use?". It is said that the official explanation for Lieutenant Colonel Spears' initial reaction was due to mental exhaustion from prolonged detention, but ordinary people do not believe this explanation, and this reporter also believes that this is somewhat contrived. After being detained for three months, Lieutenant Colonel Spears met his own military officers for the first time, but was not allowed to discuss his own case, which he had been thinking about day and night. Therefore, Lieutenant Colonel Spears' disappointment and resentful reaction seems extremely natural. This trip was merely a prison visit, and its purpose was only to inquire about his personal situation and health, which seemed bound to insult him further. In any case, the two British military officers finally entered Lieutenant Colonel Spears' cell accompanied by two Japanese. However, the conversation was purely perfunctory and only touched on his personal situation. As soon as they entered the room, Lieutenant Colonel Spears immediately asked what rescue steps the British government was taking, and they told him that they could not discuss this matter. Lieutenant Colonel Spears' physical condition is still satisfactory so far. He has no illnesses, only a lack of exercise, which has made his face slightly pale and chubby. Lieutenant Colonel Spears is detained in a small room and has no exercise, as he must be supervised by one of the prison guards when he is allowed to go outside. According to the military etiquette followed by most civilized armies, a detained officer has the right to be guarded by an officer of the same rank during exercise. For this reason, Lieutenant Colonel Spears does not use his right to go outside unless absolutely necessary. He also complained about the lack of change in the food provided. The two British military officers were certain that Lieutenant Colonel Spears was still alive and healthy, and flew back to Beijing the next day to report. Most people do not understand what purpose this perfunctory trip had, other than being a way for the two governments to save face. If this is all the British government can do after three months, then the chance of Lieutenant Colonel Spears being released soon seems extremely remote.</p>

<h3>General Situation in Shanghai After the Outbreak of the European War: Foreign Exchange May Ease, Foreign Goods Will Become Expensive; Chinese Industry and Commerce Strive for Production Opportunities; British Ships Have Been Ordered to Concentrate</h3>
<p>Since Germany's handling of the Danzig issue has created a situation where a single hair can move the whole body, the European situation has become increasingly precarious. Recently, while efforts for peace have not yet reached a point of despair, news suddenly came last night from foreign wire services that German troops have taken military action against Poland. As soon as the news spread, Chinese and foreign people in this city were extremely concerned and watched closely the developments that would follow. This city is the premier commercial port in the Far East, and the general impact that this news will have on the market is greatly valued by all sectors. The relevant news is recorded in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Relaxed Foreign Exchange Will Benefit Legal Tender</p>
<p>When this reporter asked people in the banking sector about the extent to which the outbreak of the European war would affect finance in this city, it was said that since the price of gold gradually increased and foreign exchange tightened, general finance in Shanghai has been more sluggish than in the past. However, since the Exchange Stabilization Fund has made every effort to stabilize foreign exchange, it has been stabilizing in recent weeks. Although the scope of this European military action is still unknown, foreign exchange can be expected to relax. In the future, the conversion rate between legal tender and foreign exchange will become more stable, that is, the foundation of legal tender will become more solid. As far as China's foreign trade is concerned, the necessary goods of Chinese native products will inevitably become popular in the international market in the future. Because the countries involved in European military actions will be directly and indirectly affected by the war, industrial production will inevitably be reduced. It is a good opportunity for Chinese goods to take the opportunity to develop.</p>
<p>Prices of Foreign Goods Will Inevitably Rise</p>
<p>Last night, this reporter also inquired with various Chinese and foreign merchants dealing in European goods about the impact of the deteriorating European situation on their respective industries. The points discussed are as follows: Generally speaking, for those who deal in various European goods, the current trend of various European goods that have already been shipped is uniformly expected to rise. As for the goods that have been ordered and are already on their way, it is hoped that they can be shipped to Shanghai. For those that have not yet been shipped, it will be difficult to continue to ship them because most of the foreign merchant ships have been requisitioned. Since various goods will be difficult to deliver in the future, although foreign exchange may be looser, the prices of foreign goods in China will still rise.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth and Dyes Will Not Be Greatly Affected</p>
<p>In terms of major industries related to European goods, the import of European goods in the cotton cloth category has been reduced in recent years due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the increase in Chinese products. Last night, major figures in the industry held a meeting and believed that even if the European war unfortunately broke out, the industry would not be greatly affected in terms of foreign exchange. In terms of the dye industry, importers have sent urgent telegrams to the UK, Germany, and other countries urging them to speed up the loading of goods to China since the European situation became tense. A large batch of goods is currently on its way to China and is expected to arrive in the middle of this month. Since the Shanghai War, various dyeing and weaving factories, as well as fur, leather, and appliance factories, have sprung up in western Shanghai, and the demand for dyes is quite high. Therefore, dye merchants have increased orders in view of the turbulent European situation. According to people in the industry, if the ordered goods can be shipped quickly, these dyes and the goods in stock on the market can be expected to be sufficient for two years. In addition, many private individuals have also invested in orders due to the European situation. Therefore, the import of dyes in the first half of this year reached 16,628,419 yuan, an increase of more than 10 million yuan compared to 4,899,487 yuan in the same period last year, which is four times the import amount of last year.</p>
<p>Hardware Shortages and Woolen Fabrics Rise in Price</p>
<p>In addition, although the hardware industry has rapidly placed orders, the goods shipped out by various countries in the tense atmosphere have already been subject to considerable restrictions, so the inventory is said not to be very large. However, domestic substitutes are occasionally manufactured, so it is expected that there will be no major impact. Most woolen fabrics come from the UK, France, the United States, Belgium, and other countries. Recently, prices have risen due to foreign exchange relations. However, it is said that few people in the industry have settled foreign exchange for their orders.</p>
<p>China Seizes the Opportunity to Strive for Production</p>
<p>According to business people, it is still difficult to predict the scope of this military action, and it is impossible to turn hostility into friendship. However, various goods from the United States may still be shipped out in a steady stream. Moreover, China's industry has been developing rapidly in recent years. Therefore, even if various European goods are affected by the situation and cannot be shipped to China smoothly, the Chinese market will never be in the same situation as during the First European War. It is hoped that merchants dealing in European goods will not raise prices excessively, which will adversely affect business. On the contrary, Chinese industry and commerce have another good opportunity to strive for production in this tense European situation.</p>
<p>British Ships Ordered Not to Be Transferred</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that the British Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday (August 31st) issued a new regulation signed by British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, prohibiting British ships from being transferred to people or companies of other nationalities. This is evidence of the impact of the European crisis on Shanghai. This regulation is a wartime preventive measure to retain British ships under the British flag in the event of war. The new regulation stipulates that British ships or shares of British ships may not be transferred or mortgaged without the permission of the Ministry of Commerce, but ships of autonomous territories are not included in the new regulation because autonomous territories formulate their own laws for ships registered in their territories. This new order is called the "British Ship Transfer Regulation of 1939" and is now in effect. The shipping department of the British Consulate General posted a preliminary warning on August 30th and took it down yesterday. The warning stated that British ships could not be transferred after the outbreak of war. The new regulation did not mention the outbreak of war, but the transfer and sale were immediately prohibited after the order was signed. Yesterday, the shipping consul of the British Consulate General explained that the new regulation was a wartime preventive measure, but it has been put into effect because of the European crisis. As a result of the European crisis, all British ships around the world are under the control of the Admiralty.</p>
<p>British Ships Are Preparing to Concentrate</p>
<p>The European situation is serious, and the foreign shipping industry is greatly affected. The Italian ship "Giuliana" was supposed to return to Europe on August 30th, but it has suspended its voyage and moved to the Texaco Oil Wharf in Shanghai yesterday to prepare for a long-term stay. The French mail ship "Chenla Bao" was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday (September 1st). After the ship arrived in Saigon, it originally intended to stay there, but it resumed its voyage to Shanghai on the order of the company and will arrive in port tomorrow (September 3rd). The above information has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the British company's "Ranchi" departed from London on August 1st and sailed to the Far East. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (September 3rd). After the ship arrived in Singapore on August 25th, it suddenly received a telegram from the head office ordering it to return to the UK. Therefore, it will not come to Shanghai. The next "Ranpura" departed from London on August 15th and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th of this month. It is said that after the ship arrives in Shanghai, it will not go to Japan, and will return to London from Shanghai on the 23rd, replacing the "Ranchi" schedule. As for the Jardine Matheson and Taikoo companies, which operate on the Chinese coastal lines, they have been ordered by their head offices to add 600 to 1,000 tons of spare coal to each ship. Afterwards, they will concentrate at designated locations after receiving emergency telegrams. However, the Yongsheng ship of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which was originally scheduled to sail to the North China line of Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin this afternoon, and the passengers and cargo have already been loaded, suddenly received a telegram from the port company yesterday morning ordering it to sail to Haiphong and Hong Kong. Therefore, after unloading the North China cargo, it left port at 4:00 pm yesterday and went to Haiphong via Hong Kong. It is said that Germany and Poland had a conflict yesterday. It is still difficult to predict the trend of foreign merchant ships in this city today.</p>
<p>Few British Reservists in Shanghai</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that as far as is known for certain, the British authorities have not called up British army, navy, and air force reservists in Shanghai. According to the British Admiralty, the decision to call up naval reservists overseas is made by the commanders-in-chief of each fleet. The army authorities said that they must receive a telegram from London before calling up reservists, and believe that there are not many army reservists in Shanghai. Three British naval reserve officers, who are employed by several commercial firms in this city, have been "lent" to assist the British naval authorities in Shanghai in controlling commercial navigation. According to a notice from the British Embassy to the British Consulate General, special travel facilities will be provided to reserve officers in the event of war. German residents in the French Concession of this city have been notified by the French authorities that they will not be harmed or interfered with as long as they do not disturb the peace and order.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hong Kong Telegrams Must Use Plain Code</p>
<p>Yesterday, various foreign merchant shipping companies in this city received telegrams from their head offices in Hong Kong stating that all telegrams sent to Hong Kong, whether wired or wireless, in Chinese or Western languages, must use plain code and not use secret code.</p>
<h3>Polish Minister to Leave Shanghai Tomorrow; Polish Consul General Hosts Farewell Banquet</h3>
<p>Polish Minister to China, Wei Dengtao, has been ordered to return to his country and will take on a new position. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai by ship tomorrow. The Polish Consul General in Shanghai, Pu Huomu Yun, and his staff held a farewell banquet for Minister Wei and his wife at the French Club on August 31st.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Enters Bohai Bay</h3>
<p>The Pacific hurricane swept past Shanghai again to the east, and after heading to the Yellow Sea, it struck Qingdao violently on the morning of the day before yesterday. At 6:00 am yesterday, the Zikawei Observatory reported that the hurricane had reached 38 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude, heading northwest, with its center within a radius of 60 nautical miles. The wind was still strong and moving very slowly. According to the reported location, the hurricane struck Qingdao and then turned into Bohai Bay. It is said that the damage caused by the hurricane in Qingdao was extremely serious. As for the weather in this city, after it cleared up, the temperature has gradually been rising again. In addition, the Huangpu River had a high tide after 1:00 pm yesterday, reaching more than eleven feet.</p>
<h3>Two Assassination Cases Occurred in One Day; Zhang Tao and Wang Liangxian Shot and Killed One After Another</h3>
<p>Recently, assassinations have suddenly increased again. Yesterday, two shooting cases occurred in one day. One occurred on Route Magny in the French Concession, where Dr. Zhang Tao was shot and killed in a rickshaw on his way back from a house call at around 3:00 pm. The other occurred on Nanking West Road, where Wang Liangxian was shot and killed in an alley after leaving his residence after 9:00 pm. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Tao</p>
<p>Zhang Tao, from Chongming, was 33 years old and practiced Western medicine, operating a clinic attached to his residence. At around 2:00 pm yesterday, he was invited by a patient surnamed Zhou who lived at 160 Route Magny, and took a rickshaw driven by rickshaw puller Zhang Xiaoliang (20 years old, from the same hometown as Zhang) to treat the illness. At around 3:00 pm, after finishing the treatment and prescription at the Zhou's residence, he still took the original rickshaw home. When he reached a shop facing east at the intersection of Route Magny, a gangster wearing a gray long gown and riding a bicycle suddenly came up to him and approached Zhang's rickshaw. He took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired three shots at Zhang's back. One shot entered the left brain and exited the lower right jaw, and one bullet entered from the buttocks and pierced the abdomen. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the murderer turned around and fled. Zhang's rickshaw puller was pulling the rickshaw and running. He suddenly heard gunshots and looked back while running. He saw that his master Zhang Tao had been shot and was bleeding profusely. He was greatly shocked and stopped the rickshaw and shouted for the police to come. The murderer had already disappeared. He reported to the police station and summoned an ambulance to rush Zhang to the Guangci Hospital. Because the injuries were serious, he died before he could be treated. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for autopsy. The police sent detectives to investigate the cause of death near the place of the incident and at the residence of the deceased. The police station ordered all detectives on duty to pay close attention to strictly apprehending the fugitive murderer and bringing him to justice for interrogation. It is said that Zhang has a wife, Tong, who is 31 years old and from Chongming.</p>
<p>Wang Liangxian</p>
<p>In Lane 1699, Nanking West Road, a shooting occurred at around 9:00 pm yesterday. The victim was Wang Liangxian, 37 years old, from Huzhou, who lived at No. 83 in the lane. At the time, he had just left his residence and reached the entrance of the lane when he suddenly encountered two men who flashed out from the side. Without asking any questions, they fired three shots at Wang. One of the shots hit the back of Wang's head, and he immediately fell to the ground. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the assailants also ran out of the lane and fled. At this time, the nearby sentry guards were searching because they heard the gunshots, and Wang's family members also went out to check after hearing the gunshots. It was then discovered that Wang had been injured, and they were greatly shocked. They urgently hired a streetcar on the road and sent Wang to the Jingansi police station in charge of the area, and then transferred him to the Red Cross on Haig Road for treatment. He died from his serious injuries at 11:10 pm that night. Detectives were dispatched to investigate the case.</p>

<h3>Customs Forced to Accept Counterfeit Currency, Japanese Side Forcibly Occupies Tax Collection Office, Chinese Bank Tax Staff Unable to Perform Duties, De Facto Tax Increase Affects British and American Trade</h3>
<p>Central Shanghai Bank Telegraphs Yudu Report of Events</p>
<p>Beginning yesterday, the Jianghai Customs actually accepted "Hwa Hsing Notes." The tax collection office was forcibly occupied by Japanese personnel from the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the tax collection staff of the Central Bank were forced to withdraw. An urgent telegram was sent to the Chongqing head office reporting that this constituted a de facto tax increase, affecting the trade of British and American merchants with China. Furthermore, the Customs Gold Exchange Certificates of the Central Bank and the bills of Chinese commercial firms were refused. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Customs Forced to Accept Counterfeit Currency</p>
<p>Li Jiannan, the "Superintendent of Jianghai Customs," announced on August 31 that "from September 1st, customs duties paid in Customs Gold Unit Certificates and Customs Gold Checks will no longer be accepted. All customs duties and other taxes will be paid in 'Hwa Hsing Notes.'" Oyama Kotanaka, the Japanese extra Deputy Commissioner of Customs at Jianghai Customs, actually accepted the notification from "Superintendent Li" and implemented it yesterday. The Customs Commissioner, Mr. Lawford, attempted to propose a compromise in the hope of preventing problems with the Central Bank's tax collection office, but ultimately no good solution was found. Although Commissioner Lawford has not yet issued a formal announcement accepting "Hwa Hsing Notes," in fact, Jianghai Customs has already implemented the use of "Hwa Hsing Notes" as the conversion standard.</p>
<p>Japanese Personnel Forcibly Occupy Various Tax Collection Offices</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank dispatched a large number of Japanese personnel to the Central Bank's tax collection office at Jianghai Customs, as well as its affiliated post office and two offices at the customs wharf, to take over the tax collection business. Each location was closely guarded by Japanese police officers from the Jianghai Customs water police station. The roads around the tax collection offices were patrolled by Chinese, Japanese, and Western detectives dispatched by the concession police. All personnel from the Central Bank's tax collection offices were forced to stop working at the tax collection offices because they had been forcibly occupied by Japanese personnel. Signs displaying the exchange rates set by the "Superintendent of Jianghai Customs" were hung at the entrances of each office.</p>
<p>Real Purpose is to Increase Taxes</p>
<p>The "Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office" announced yesterday the exchange rates for Customs Gold converted to "Hwa Hsing Notes" and Legal Tender converted to "Hwa Hsing Notes" as follows: One Customs Gold dollar equals 2.532 "Hwa Hsing Notes," and one "Hwa Hsing Note" converts to 1.55 Legal Tender dollars. If customs duties are paid in Legal Tender, then 3.925 Legal Tender dollars equals one Customs Gold dollar. Therefore, the decision to change to "Hwa Hsing Notes" as the standard is in fact a de facto increase in taxes, reaching nearly 50 to 60 percent. For example, the day before, 2.556 Legal Tender dollars equaled one Customs Gold dollar, but yesterday it increased to 3.925 Legal Tender dollars equaling one Customs Gold dollar.</p>
<p>Refusal to Accept Customs Gold Certificates, Etc.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank posted the same announcement in Chinese, English, and Japanese at the tax collection office, stating: "Notice: This bank will only accept cashier's checks issued by Japanese banks, the Hwa Hsing Commercial Bank, and foreign banks, as well as checks guaranteed for payment by the aforementioned banks. All payments for customs duties and customs revenues exceeding 100 Legal Tender dollars must be paid with the above-mentioned cashier's checks or checks. Merchants are expected to comply. This notice is issued on September 1, 1939." The Customs Gold Exchange Certificates with full reserves and the cashier's checks of Chinese banks, which have a well-established reputation for credit, were actually refused.</p>
<p>Chinese Bank Tax Staff Forced to Withdraw</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (August 31), various importers and exporters, upon hearing that Jianghai Customs would switch to using "Hwa Hsing Notes," rushed to the Central Bank's tax collection office to pay taxes. Therefore, the tax revenue for that day was not completed until 9:00 PM. The tax revenue suddenly increased, totaling more than 2 million national currency dollars. After completion at 9:00 PM, Customs Commissioner Lawford sent personnel to take away the keys to the tax collection office. Yesterday morning, more than 100 personnel from the Central Bank's tax collection office attempted to go to their respective offices to work, but upon seeing that the offices had been forcibly occupied by Japanese personnel, they were forced to return to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank under the leadership of Director Shen to report the forced occupation and await orders from the Director-General.</p>
<p>Telegram Sent to Chongqing Head Office Yesterday Reporting Events</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from relevant sources that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, after firmly rejecting the proposal by the Jianghai Customs Commissioner to accept "Hwa Hsing Notes," urgently telegraphed Chongqing yesterday to report the forced withdrawal of tax collection personnel to the head office. At the same time, the Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Maze, was notified. Furthermore, the colleagues at the tax collection office firmly opposed the acceptance of "Hwa Hsing Notes," and all gathered at the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank yesterday, awaiting the Director-General's instructions. It is reported that the tax collection personnel have all received considerable training in taxation and are different from ordinary collection personnel, possessing special tax collection skills.</p>
<p>Inspector General of Customs Unaware</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Jianghai Customs changing to "Hwa Hsing Notes" as the standard, Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Maze, had not received a report from the Customs Commissioner, Mr. Lawford, in advance, nor had he received an order from the Chinese government's Ministry of Finance. He also had not received a formal report afterward. It is also reported that the Chinese authorities were deeply surprised by the change to "Hwa Hsing Notes" for customs revenue at Jianghai Customs. The Ministry of Finance has requested the British diplomatic delegation to inquire with the British Ambassador for all the details.</p>
<p>Tax Collection Situation After the Takeover</p>
<p>Furthermore, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited the Jianghai Customs tax collection office and the post office branch offices several times yesterday. (1) No one went to the Jianghai Customs tax collection office to pay taxes yesterday morning. Those who paid in the afternoon all paid in Legal Tender and foreign bank cashier's checks and checks. (2) Before 11:00 AM yesterday, the post office branch office only accepted tax-exempt mail. After 11:00 AM, taxes on mail were all paid in Legal Tender, and no one was seen holding so-called "Hwa Hsing Notes." However, the taxes paid yesterday increased by more than 50 percent compared to the day before.</p>
<p>Customs Gold Exchange Rate Announced as Usual</p>
<p>Regarding the Customs Gold Exchange Certificates issued by the Central Bank, the issuance ended at the end of 1937, with a total issuance amount of 40,963,070, backed by full cash reserves. The Customs Gold Unit was implemented starting on February 1, 1930. The collection of gold coins was first implemented for import duties. All imported foreign goods, regardless of their original currency, must be converted into Customs Gold Units according to the prescribed ratio, and the customs duties to be paid are calculated in Customs Gold. Yesterday, the Central Bank announced the Customs Gold Unit as one Customs Gold dollar equaling 2.565 Legal Tender dollars.</p>
<p>Affects British and American Trade in China</p>
<p>British and American legitimate import and export merchants are paying close attention to the change to "Hwa Hsing Notes" as the standard by Jianghai Customs, because after implementation, it will result in a de facto increase in taxes. Therefore, they all believe that it will affect trade with China. Moreover, British and American banks in China, such as HSBC, Citibank, and Mercantile, all refuse to accept "Hwa Hsing Notes." Therefore, it is rumored that British and American merchants may make representations, and Shanghai's foreign trade may suffer a major blow as a result.</p>
<p>Various Industries Refuse Counterfeit Hwa Hsing Currency</p>
<p>Shanghai's banks, money shops, and currency exchange shops have repeatedly received orders from the Ministry of Finance to refuse to accept "Hwa Hsing Notes." Therefore, to date, "Hwa Hsing Notes" can only be used in the Hongkou area and its occupied areas. "Hwa Hsing Notes" have not been found south of the Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession and the French Concession. It is reported that various industries will resolutely refuse to accept them in accordance with government orders in the future. Therefore, those who paid taxes to Jianghai Customs yesterday did not use "Hwa Hsing Notes."</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Municipal Bank Accepts Demand Deposits</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Municipal Bank will accept demand deposits on September 1, 2, 4, and 5 (Friday, Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday), with an annual interest rate of 5%. The collection point is the Public Debt Bank Section (Room 257) of the Finance Department within the Bureau's General Office at 209 Jiangxi Road. In addition, during daily office hours, the bank accepts term deposits of six months and twelve months in accordance with Shanghai Municipal Council Announcement No. 4911. The annual interest rate for six-month term deposits is 5%, and the annual interest rate for twelve-month term deposits is 6%. Those who wish to inquire about the details can contact the Finance Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Ordering Tribute Rice Can Ensure Food Supply and Prevent Shortages, Mr. Kui Yanfang Hopes All Sectors Will Continue to Order, Rice Store Retail Prices Still Raised by Five Dollars</h3>
<p>Since the Civil Food Maintenance Association, initiated by Yu Qiaqing, entrusted the Accountants Association to conduct registration for ordering foreign rice, various industrial and commercial groups in the city have been rushing to fill out forms to order. Yesterday, the Shanghai Poor Children's Home ordered 50 bags, and the Shanghai Fresh Fish Industry Guild ordered 200 bags, totaling 250 bags. The total for the week reached 3,986 bags. Due to the recent sharp drop in rice prices, most are taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>Mr. Kui Still Hopes for Continued Ordering of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>A reporter from Daguan News Agency, noting the sharp drop in rice prices in recent days and the prevailing wait-and-see attitude towards ordering foreign rice, interviewed Mr. Kui Yanfang yesterday to inquire about his views. He stated that he and Mr. Yu Qiaqing, etc., previously believed that the source of rice for the Shanghai market was obstructed, rice prices were soaring, and the food problem was forming an unprecedentedly serious situation. Therefore, after gathering merchants, they decided to initiate the ordering of foreign rice to provide assistance. The first step was to persuade major industrial and commercial firms to order, so that reserves could be prepared, and rice prices could be expected to be suppressed. At a time when foreign exchange is tight, we clearly know that ordering foreign rice may not be appropriate, but it is a necessary expedient to provide food assistance and maintain public order. Fortunately, rice prices in Shanghai have gradually trended downwards, but we still hope that various industries can continue to actively order foreign rice. Although its price may be higher than domestic rice, and various industries may suffer losses, it can actually ensure that the friends in each industry have sufficient food and no longer compete with ordinary people for food. Then the citizens can obtain cheap rice, and its merit will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Continued to Fall by One Dollar Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the amount of goods arriving at the Hexia wharf was eight boats, totaling 1,630 piculs. In addition to these 1,630 piculs offered on the market, brokers also offered 3,176 bags for sale, so the market was still oversupplied. Therefore, rice prices continued to fall by about one dollar. The highest grade of white japonica rice was 27 dollars, and ordinary indica rice was around 22 dollars. Glutinous rice, because it is not a staple food, has fallen to 28 dollars. It has fallen by more than 10 dollars in four days, but the market price is still expected to fall.</p>
<p>Rice Store Retail Prices Still High</p>
<p>Although the rice market has fallen by more than 10 dollars for several consecutive days, the retail prices in some rice stores are still raised by 5 dollars (yesterday's market price was 27 dollars, but the retail price was 32 dollars). Therefore, ordinary people are still suffering from great pressure. Yesterday, a person in the rice industry told a reporter from Daguan News Agency that the early rice harvest in Taixing, Taizhou, Rugao, and other places in Jiangsu Province this year was abundant, so rice merchants have already gone to purchase in order to transport it to Shanghai for the market. A large amount should arrive in the coming days, and the market price can be gradually suppressed.</p>
<p>The Times Suspends Publication</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times suddenly officially announced its suspension of publication yesterday. The newspaper has been in operation for more than 30 years. Due to heavy losses over the years, which have become even worse recently, and with the business director, Wang Jilu, injured in an attack and Wu Lingyuan on sick leave, there was no one in charge. Therefore, it could not be maintained, and the board of directors decided to suspend publication with immediate effect the day before yesterday. It is reported that the newspaper's registration certificate was also taken back by personnel dispatched by the Public Concession Police Department the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Economic Stability, Encouraging Exports to Earn Foreign Exchange, Striving to Avoid Capital Outflow</p>
<p>The National Government's encouragement of domestic goods exports and reduction of luxury goods imports to enhance the economic strength of the War of Resistance has achieved significant success. According to the current ports under the control of the National Government, imports have been transformed into exports. Except for the import of machinery and tools needed for inland industrial transportation and construction, luxury goods have been absolutely reduced. The National Government's purpose is to strive to avoid capital outflow and not spend much money abroad. On the contrary, the export of domestic products is encouraged as much as possible to earn foreign exchange. Therefore, the National Government's foreign trade policy has gradually decided to adopt a barter system, using domestic products such as tung oil, tea, and metals such as tin and tungsten to exchange for foreign machinery, vehicles, munitions, or to compensate for loans. This is necessary in wartime and has been effective, so the economy has remained stable.</p>
<h3>The Fate of Four Chinese in Tianjin, Still No Definite News, Shanghai British Assize Court Sends Writ to Tianjin, Jones Expedites Secret Hearing the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that on Wednesday, the British Embassy in Shanghai received a notice from the British Consulate in Tianjin regarding the case of the four suspects in Tianjin, stating that it had received an order from the British government to take steps to hand over the suspects to the Japanese authorities. Mr. Jones of the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm in Shanghai, representing the four defendants, considering the urgency of the situation, filed another petition with the British Assize Court. Yesterday (August 31) afternoon, Judge Jones held a hearing on the case in his office, and around 4:00 PM, decided to issue a writ, immediately telegraphed to the British authorities in Tianjin, requesting them to explain the reasons for detaining the suspects.</p>
<p>The Fate of the Four Remains a Mystery</p>
<p>Whether the British government's order has already been implemented and whether British justice will prevail remains a mystery as of late last night. Personnel at the British Embassy here have been awaiting a reply telegram from Tianjin regarding the extradition of the four defendants for a long time. As of 7:00 PM last night, there was still no news. It is generally believed that the reply telegram will arrive this morning (the 1st). Judge Jones's hearing in his office yesterday was extremely secretive. Those who were concerned about the case and went to inquire were told that Judge Jones was not at the Assize Court and that if there was a hearing, it would be heard by Judge Moss on September 4.</p>
<p>The British Government's Responsibility for This Case</p>
<p>According to inquiries with an official at the British Embassy, if the writ is issued and the defendants are handed over, what legal responsibility will the British government bear? The official stated that the British government only notified, but did not order, the British Concession authorities in Tianjin to hand over the four. If they act in accordance with this notification, the government cannot be held responsible. If the notification is refused, it will prove the integrity of British justice. The writ will be debated here on September 11, and the hearing will be conducted by Judge Moss, who is returning to Shanghai today from his summer vacation in Japan. The writ is addressed to Brigadier General Rowett, commander of the British forces in Tianjin. Brigadier General Rowett may not come to Shanghai to appear in court in person, but will send a legal representative.</p>
<p>Jones' Hearing Came Suddenly</p>
<p>After the British government issued an order to the British authorities in Tianjin on August 23, the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm's procedures for rescuing the suspects were reported to the British Embassy here at any time. Judge Jones' hearing on the case yesterday came suddenly. Even last night, the embassy was not sure whether the case had been heard or would be held today. According to the British side, to hand over the four, the Tianjin puppet court must issue an arrest warrant, requesting the British authorities to extradite them, and then complete further extradition procedures on the British side before handing over the defendants.</p>
<p>The British Assize Court Has Scheduled a Debate</p>
<p>The English-language Great China Evening Post stated that regarding the current fate of the four suspects detained by the British authorities in Tianjin, no official confirmation could be obtained in Shanghai this morning (the 1st). Judge Jones of the British Assize Court here issued a writ before dusk yesterday (August 31), requesting the Tianjin authorities to explain the reasons for detaining the suspects. Mr. Jones of the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm in Shanghai stated this morning that the application for a writ of habeas corpus will be debated at the British Assize Court on September 11.</p>
<p>There is Still a Glimmer of Opportunity for a Trial</p>
<p>This means that the four currently detained, if the writ of yesterday had not arrived in Tianjin too late, would have had another opportunity to have the case heard by the British Assize Court before being extradited to the Japanese authorities in Tianjin. Although Jones implied that only London could issue direct orders on this matter, as of noon, Shanghai had not received any telegrams about where the four are currently being detained.</p>
<h3>Movement of American Warships</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet's private yacht, the "Isabel," had long been ordered by Commander Hart to sail to North China, but due to encountering a hurricane in Shanghai, although it set sail on the 30th, it returned. It is now learned that the ship left Shanghai yesterday morning, passed Qingdao, and proceeded to Northern Philippines to meet the flagship "Augusta" to await orders. In addition, the U.S. light cruiser "Marblehead," after purchasing supplies here, set sail from Shanghai yesterday afternoon following the "Isabel" to Qingdao for routine patrol work. The U.S. warship "Guam," after passing through Shanghai from the U.S. and sailing to Qinhuangdao, is scheduled to arrive here on the 5th of this month. At that time, the U.S. Fourth Naval Detachment stationed in Shanghai will return to Shanghai. After arriving, it plans to dock in Shanghai for ten days, and then take the route through Hong Kong, Manila, Honolulu, San Francisco, and the Panama Canal to return to the U.S.</p>

<h3>Japanese News Agency Spreads Inaccurate News, Leading to the American Missionary Incident in Nanchang, Japanese Military Spokesman Explains to the Outside World</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that at a reception for journalists yesterday (August 31), the Japanese Army spokesman attributed the misunderstanding caused by the incident involving American missionary Horan in Nanchang to a certain "Japanese news agency." He claimed that the Japanese news agency issued an "inaccurate" report, stating that a large number of anti-Japanese publications were found in the American Hospital in Nanchang, and that the American missionary Horan, who heads the hospital, was suspected of being anti-Japanese. The spokesman continued, stating that in fact, the publications were not found in the hospital, but in a church. The spokesman said that all claims made by the Japanese news agency regarding the relationship between the discovered publications and Missionary Horan are unfounded. The spokesman also attributed the Japanese military authorities' delay in allowing officials from the American Consulate in Hankou to go to Nanchang to investigate the matter to the Japanese news agency. According to the explanation, the Japanese authorities already knew about the "whole misunderstanding" caused by the inaccurate news from the news agency and knew that the Nanchang missionaries had "extremely friendly relations" with the Japanese military. They felt that making the public aware of this matter would escalate the seriousness of the situation and possibly lead to a deterioration in Japanese-American relations. They firmly believed that this matter could be "clarified" locally. However, they soon felt that the American Consulate authorities wanted to meet Horan and needed to have "good reasons." In view of their repeated requests, the Japanese side finally arranged for the American Vice Consul Davis in Hankou to go to Nanchang. Mr. Davis, accompanied by the Japanese Consul in Hankou, set off by boat on August 20, passing through Jiujiang to Nanchang, first stopping at Guling to inspect third-country properties, which they allowed to be American properties. According to reports from Waiqiao in the area, they were well protected and lived almost as usual. They then investigated in Jiujiang and Nanchang, and foreign residents reported the same. Mr. Davis was "very satisfied" with the situation and expressed his thanks to the Japanese authorities for their care and assistance.</p>
<h3>Passengers to Ningbo Can Board at Any Time, Shorten Sailing Schedule, Convenient Passengers</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been thriving with passengers and cargo, and every trip is crowded. Moreover, some of the ships have a deadweight of over 3,000 tons, which makes loading, unloading, and lighterage outside the Zhenhai estuary time-consuming. It is now learned that in order to solve the current difficulties in stagnation of shipping outside the port and shorten the sailing schedule to facilitate passengers, various shipping companies have separately established lighterage companies in Ningbo and hired special ships to transport passengers and cargo back and forth. According to the planned schedule, there will be three round trips per month, and new developments are often planned on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. It is also reported that the Ningbo Garrison Command, in order to facilitate passengers, has already notified the Yin County Shipping Association to inform all ships that passengers can board at any time when foreign ships carrying passengers arrive in Zhenhai to avoid long waits.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Investigate the Cause of Sample Sheet Leakage, Issue Small Denomination Notes Slowly, Shanghai Branch Suggests Adding a Seal for Issuance, Head Office Believes Issuance Should Be Postponed</h3>
<p>Regarding the issuance of 1-cent and 5-cent fractional currency notes by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, after the contract was signed with American Commercial &amp; Stationary Co., Ltd. to print them, the first batch of 500,000 yuan had already been printed in full as per the contract. Originally, it was scheduled to be issued and circulated on the 22nd of last month. However, due to the discovery of unsealed and unnumbered sample sheets in the Shanghai market, the issuance had to be postponed as a precaution. The Shanghai branch telegraphed the Chongqing head office to ask for instructions. A reporter from New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank yesterday that the head office in Chongqing had already replied with instructions, believing that there was a need for investigation. Furthermore, because the printing contract was signed in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong office has been instructed to seriously negotiate with the printing company and order them to investigate the cause of the sample sheet leakage. As for the Shanghai branch's suggestion to add a seal for issuance, the head office believes that it should be postponed until the cause is clarified. Therefore, the issuance date of the fractional currency notes is still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xinggong's Remains Encoffined Yesterday, Various Circles Attended the Funeral, Funeral Expenses Exceeded 3,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The remains of Zhu Xinggong, editor of the Night Edition of the Great China Evening Post, were encoffined at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Universal Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road.

The funerary clothes were a black jacket and a blue robe. Zhu's enlarged portrait was hung behind the coffin. Starting from 12:30 PM yesterday, people from various circles came to offer condolences, numbering 300.

<p>The Encoffining Ceremony Was Held Separately</p>
<p>At 12:00 PM, the encoffining ceremony was held. First, two Western technicians nailed the coffin lid shut. Mrs. Zhu was greatly saddened by the sight, and all the guests were in tears. A spirit table was then placed, with white candles, fresh flowers, and several dishes of food offered on it. The funeral committee arranged the encoffining ceremony to be held in sequence: (1) Family sacrifice, offering incense</p>
<h3>Approved by the Public Works Department: Public Bus Fare Increase, New Fares Effective from the 6th, Monthly Passes Also Increased Starting This Month</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Information Office announced that starting from the 6th of this month (Wednesday), the public bus company will charge according to the newly revised fares. Monthly passes will also increase in price starting from the 1st of this month. Ordinary monthly passes for adults will change from 12 yuan per month to 16 yuan, and for children, from 6 yuan per month to 8 yuan. Special express monthly passes for adults will change from 20 yuan per month to 27 yuan. The company stated to the Public Works Department that the value of Chinese legal tender has continued to decline recently, while the company needs a large number of imported raw materials in its business, resulting in a significant increase in operating costs and considerable losses. Therefore, it had no choice but to request approval to increase fares to compensate for this. When the company submitted the newly revised fare schedule to the Public Works Department, it stated that after charging the proposed new fares, if the number of passengers did not decrease, its total income was projected to increase by 22.5%. The above request has been approved by the Public Works Department, but it must be reviewed again before the end of October this year. The fact that public buses will increase fares was reported in this newspaper on August 29th. Subsequently, the company stated that it was not a fact and was also reported. Now, according to the Public Works Department Information Office, the previously reported fare increase has been confirmed.

The "Da Mei Evening News" also received letters from the outside, suggesting that a bronze statue be built for Mr. Zhu and that photographs of the statue be sold, with the proceeds going to the education expenses of Mr. Zhu's orphans. Others suggested holding a memorial service for Mr. Zhu and organizing the publication of Mr. Zhu's posthumous works. The funeral committee of the newspaper will carefully discuss the above points to put them into practice. The Hong Kong Young Journalists Association branch, in addition to sending a telegram of condolence to Mr. Zhu's family, also launched a fundraising campaign to help Mr. Zhu's family. In addition to receiving 500 yuan in condolence money at the funeral home yesterday, the "Da Mei Evening News" also received 500 yuan in donations from an anonymous donor and 200 yuan from a group of readers (names not disclosed). Approximately 1,700 to 1,800 yuan in condolence money was collected in one day, and the amount combined with the previous day's earnings was more than 3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Application for Business License Must Be Granted Before Opening</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Donation Office stated that shops within the concession often open for business immediately after submitting their license application to the Public Works Department, which is not in compliance. Therefore, a statement has been added to the license application form: "Submitting a license application does not immediately allow the applicant to start business. Business can only commence after the license has been approved and granted."</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest at Ewo Cotton Mill: Workers Clash with Gatekeepers, Eight Workers Injured, Caused by Loom Shop Shutdown</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 6:00 a.m., a labor dispute suddenly occurred at the British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill at 670 Yangshupu Road, Hongkou. At the same time, workers in the factory also clashed with the gatekeeper. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Proposed Layoffs Spark Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>The British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill has been in operation for many years and is a large-scale operation with a total of more than 6,500 workers. Recently, the factory claimed that due to soaring prices in Shanghai and sluggish sales of factory goods, its income had plummeted. Therefore, it recently proposed to temporarily lay off 150 male and female workers in the loom shop, pending further arrangements. The workers in the shop, believing that their livelihoods were threatened, firmly opposed it. In addition to explaining the situation, the factory provided each person who was laid off with a subsidy of 30 cents per day. However, the labor side still believed that this meager amount was difficult to sustain life, resulting in a stalemate between the two sides.</p>
<p>Clash Occurs, Eight Injured</p>
<p>At 6:20 a.m. yesterday, the workers still entered the factory as usual to work. However, they were refused entry by more than 50 Indian gatekeepers of the factory. As a result, the two sides clashed due to language barriers. A melee ensued, with stones and wooden sticks flying everywhere, sirens blaring, and the order in chaos. Upon receiving the news, the Yulin Road Police Department immediately dispatched a large team of detectives to suppress the situation. It was discovered that eight male and female workers were injured, including Wang Faming from Yangzhou, Mei Guozhi from Jiangbei, Yu Chengzhi from Shanghai, Sheng Licheng from Shaoxing, Mei Dexin from Yangzhou, and female workers Wang Amao, Wu Acui, and Wang Xiuying, etc. Most of them were injured in the head and legs. They were immediately taken to the Shanghai East Hospital for treatment. It was also reported that two Indian gatekeepers were also injured.</p>
<h3>Estate of Late Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Shoufan: Dispute Among Wives</h3>
<p>Dai Shoufan, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner of Chinese nationality, lived in Shanghai for many years and had one wife and two concubines. On the 12th of last month, Dai died of illness at his residence at No. 12 Tingyun Lane, Lafayette Road. The person living there was his third concubine, Ms. Li, who was from Beijing. After Dai's death, disagreements suddenly arose among his wives and concubines. On the 2nd of last month, it was the three-seven day after Dai's death, and his principal wife, Dai Qiu, and his second concubine, Dai Zhou, both set up a sacrifice at Dai Li's place. At that time, Dai Zhou ordered her son, Dai Jianhua, to transport two clothing trunks from that place to No. 5 Caishifang, Caishi Road,</p>
<p>her own residence. Dai Li then reported to the French Concession Police, saying that He Qiao and Dai Zhou had committed theft together. The French Concession Administration, based on Dai Li's accusation, filed a public prosecution. The case had already been postponed for further questioning of witnesses by Judge Huang Yan of the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Huang opened the eighth criminal court yesterday for trial. The defendants, Dai Qiu and Dai Zhou, appeared in court with their defense lawyer, Ge Zhitan, to await trial. Witness Shen Wang proved that on the 2nd of last month, Dai Zhou's son, Dai Jianhua, came to transport the clothing trunks and stated his intentions.</p>
<p>It was not theft, according to the plaintiff, Dai Li, and the defendants, Dai Qiu and Dai Zhou, who testified in court, each holding their own version of events. The court believed that the facts were clear and ordered the start of the debate. Lawyer Fei Xizhen, representing the French Concession Administration, stated that after a detailed questioning by the presiding judge, it was said that the defendants were accused of theft, but there seemed to be no legal basis for it, and requested the presiding judge to rule according to law. Then lawyer Ge Zhidong argued that the essential element of theft is to secretly take someone else's property for one's own illegal possession without the person's knowledge. However, this case has absolutely no</p>
<p>This situation exists: Dai Jianhua is the biological son of the deceased Dai Shoufan, following his mother Dai Zhou's orders to move his own two clothing trunks, and it was done in broad daylight, under the eyes of reporters and the public, with absolutely no secretive behavior. At most, this case is a family dispute after Dai Shoufan's death. How can it constitute theft? Therefore, he requested the court to declare the defendants not guilty. The court then declared the trial concluded and scheduled sentencing for the 8th.</p>
<p>Customs Cruiser "Yunxing" Still Not Returned</p>
<p>Since the customs cruiser "Lianxing" was returned, although the Japanese side also promised to return "Yunxing", it has not yet materialized. Currently, "Lianxing" is still docked in the Huangpu River and has not gone to sea to perform anti-smuggling duties. Also, the whereabouts of other customs cruisers such as "Fuxing" are still unknown. The German Jewish refugee, Fanteligmu Lai, whose mother-in-law died of illness on the 17th of last month at the German Refugee Hospital at 708 Huasheng Road, Hongkou, but two gold rings worth one hundred yuan worn by the deceased were missing. Therefore, it was reported to the Yulin Road Police Department, and Western Detective Kaurman went to the German Refugee Hospital to investigate. It was found that the hospital's clerk, George Maurice Pia, a German Jew, was highly suspected in this case. He was arrested and interrogated. At first, he tried to deny it, but finally confessed to the embezzlement, saying that he had sold the gold rings to the Sufo Jewelry Store at No. 30 Huishan Road for 29 yuan. The Western detective then went to retrieve the stolen goods. Yesterday morning, George Maurice Pia was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him for business embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Law, and requested a postponement because valuable items belonging to the deceased were often stolen in the hospital. After Judge Xiao's questioning, he ordered him to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<h3>Dong Han Yunfu and Others Accused of Stealing and Selling Houses, Han Repeatedly Failed to Appear in Court, Court Ordered Trial Closed and Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Li Yunzhou, a local man over sixty years old who runs a construction business called Li Yunji, entrusted an agent to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Han Yunnan (also known as Han Taotao), the former head of the land survey and guarantor of Baobentang, and Wu Yunsun, Qian Shigang, etc., of forging documents and seals to steal and sell his properties, requesting investigation and prosecution. It is alleged that thirteen buildings and one side room and garage at Dexing Lane, Gansidong Road, were built by the plaintiff on land leased from landlords Lu Jiantang and Ye A'gen in the 15th year of the Republic of China. In the 17th year, Han Yunfu was entrusted to</p>
<p>Mortgage them to the National Bank for 5,350 yuan, with Wu Yunsun acting as the scribe for the mortgage. However, when the plaintiff needed money for construction, he borrowed from Han in installments. By the 25th year, including the mortgage, he owed a total of 9,518 yuan. Then Han made the plaintiff sign a mortgage of 10,000 yuan, and Han collected the rent from Dexing Lane to offset the principal and interest of the mortgage. When the plaintiff asked Han to settle the accounts, he repeatedly delayed. Later, a Dane named Bidesheng suddenly</p>
<p>Sued the plaintiff in the civil court for rent arrears. The plaintiff said that he had built the houses himself, so why would he pay rent? The plaintiff then produced a sales deed, saying that the property had been sold to Qian Shigang for 8,000 yuan. The plaintiff absolutely denied it, saying that this matter was entirely the result of Han, Wu, and Qian forging documents and stealing and selling the property, requesting investigation and prosecution, etc. This case has been repeatedly opened and summoned by Judge Zhang Minsheng, but Han has not appeared, so the case was postponed. Yesterday, the hearing was continued. Han claimed to be in Hong Kong and still did not appear. Only the two defendants, Wu and Qian, appeared and admitted that they</p>
<p>Wrote the sales deed and collected 8,000 yuan, which was delivered to the plaintiff by the mediator Lu Haoyuan, etc. However, the plaintiff insisted that there was only a mortgage and no sale. After carefully reviewing the case, the court ordered the lawyers of both parties to make their arguments and then announced the closure of the case, with sentencing scheduled for a later date.</p>
<h3>Woman Elopes, Jumps from Car, Dies</h3>
<p>Gong Yuan, a woman from Chongming, thirty years old this year, eloped from the countryside and came to Shanghai three years ago. Until 8:00 a.m. on the 31st of last month, at the Remy Road small market in the French Concession, she was spotted by her husband's older sister, Lin Gong (thirty-three years old, working as a domestic helper for a Western family at No. 44 Aimee Road), and was grabbed by Gong and dragged to her employer's house on Aimee Road for a temporary stay. Then, Gong hired car No. 18287 from the Silver Car Company to take Yuan to her relative Yu Gong's house in a flat behind the Xiajia House on Jufu Road for a temporary stay, before sending her back to her hometown. Unexpectedly, when the car drove to the front of No. 326 Fulvli Road, Gong Yuan opened the car door from inside and jumped out to escape. Because the car was traveling very fast, she fell to the ground after jumping out, and suffered injuries to her head and internal organs. She was sent to the hospital, but died at 8:30 p.m. that night due to the severity of the injuries. The hospital reported it to the police department, and the body was sent to the morgue. Yesterday, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court came to the morgue to examine the body and confirmed that Gong Yuan had died from injuries sustained from jumping from the car. Because no family members came to claim the body, the official ordered the body to be buried by the church.</p>
<h3>Robbery Under the Guise of Checking Permits, Culprits Apprehended</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, Zheng Zuming was riding his bicycle near the intersection of Dunbe Road and Kaixuan Road in western Shanghai when three men, Yuan Fusheng from Jiangyin, Tao Amao from Hangzhou, and Guo Xiaosan from Jiangbei, suddenly stopped him and claimed to be checking permits. Zheng argued that although the area was an area beyond the concession, there was no need for a permit. After a brief dispute, they forcibly took 1.7 yuan in cash from him. At that time, Western Constable No. 26 and Chinese Constables No. 1143, etc., were passing by in an armored car and shouted for them to stop. The three men were immediately arrested, the stolen goods were found, and they were taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Department. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted them for gang robbery and requested a postponement for investigation. The defendants denied the charges, claiming that Zheng had hit Guo Xiaosan with his bicycle and voluntarily compensated him with 1.7 yuan. The court ordered the three defendants to be detained for seven days for further investigation and questioning.</p>
<h3>Trafficking Opium Between Suzhou and Shanghai, Chen Liwen Sentenced to Three Years</h3>
<p>Chen Liwen, a Guangdong native, sixty-five years old this year, has recently been working for Guo Keqin's soil business in Suzhou, transporting soil between Suzhou and Shanghai. At around 1:00 p.m. on the 31st of last month, he came to Shanghai again to purchase ten large bags of red soil worth 1,980 yuan from Wufeng Soil Business, intending to transport them to Suzhou. When he was traveling near Kangnuot Road and Yanping Road, he was searched by the Xunqian team of the Gedeng Road Police Department and taken to the police department. Chinese Detective No. 243 investigated and the defendant admitted to helping Guo Keqin buy, sell, and transport opium without denial. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court and prosecuted according to law. Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial and concluded that Chen Liwen intended to sell and possessed opium, and sentenced him to three years of imprisonment and confiscation of the opium.</p>
<h3>Saving Flower and Wine Expenses for Disaster Relief, Promotion Begins, Solicitation Committee Sends Letters to Brothels, Promoting Widely to Benefit Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens Group Solicitation Committee is promoting the saving of flower and wine expenses for disaster relief. After being approved by the Association, it officially began yesterday. Given the flower industry's past enthusiasm for participating in disaster relief, this move is expected to yield considerable results. The association sent letters to brothels throughout the city to promote the initiative widely: Dear Sirs, Saving on entertainment expenses for disaster relief is an urgent task at present. It would be more effective if the campaign to save entertainment expenses could be initiated and participated in by the flower industry. We are enclosing two copies of the "Save on Entertainment Expenses" notice and respectfully request that you post them at your establishment to promote it widely. Please notify us by telephone (telephone number 18533) at any time regarding donations, and we will send someone to collect them. We hope you will support and promote this initiative to benefit disaster victims. Terms of saving entertainment expenses: (1) Do not smoke cigarettes or expensive cigars priced over one yuan; (2) Do not drink alcohol or other beverages priced over two yuan; (3) Do not eat shark fin; (4) Save five yuan per table in principle. We hope you will consider this.</p>
<h3>Opium Trafficker Chen Xingyin Sentenced</h3>
<p>Chen A'wu (also known as Desheng), the owner of the Hengfeng Pawnshop at No. 134 Mengdelan Road, was a Chaozhou native. Previously, he was found by Chinese Detective Chief Ye Yuxi and Detective Li Shugui of the Anti-Narcotics Department for privately trafficking opium. They went to arrest Chen Su, together with his sister-in-law Chen Zhong and 164 taels of opium, and escorted them to the First Special Court. Chen A'wu was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, Chen Zhong to two years and six months, and an arrest warrant was issued for the Chaozhou native Chen Xingyin, who was an accomplice and was at large. It is now known that Chen Xingyin has been arrested by the Chinese and Western detectives handling this case at Room 221 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him according to law. The defendant also hired a lawyer to appear in court on his behalf. Judge Xiao ruled that Chen Xingyin was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for jointly selling opium.</p>
<h3>Failure to Control Vegetables</h3>
<p>The attempt by some in Pudong to block vegetables and sell them in Hongkou, implementing a disguised form of control, has been cancelled. The instigators, unwilling to give up, are trying to revive the plan, claiming that it will be implemented on September 1st. However, yesterday was the deadline, and no one was intercepting the vegetables. All the vegetables from Pudong were still transported through the Dongchang Road pier and sold in the concession. It is understood that the reason for the failure was a rebuttal from "higher authorities."</p>
<h3>Over Thirty People Poisoned by Eating Cakes, Cake Shop Owner Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhang Caiying (47 years old), a local woman from No. 43 Bolin Village, Lao Shenfu Road, returned yesterday from celebrating Qi Jia's birthday with many cakes. She distributed them to her neighbors, but most of them were poisoned after eating them, totaling more than thirty people. After the police department received the news, they immediately dispatched an ambulance to transport them to the hospital and arrested Wang, the owner of the Dejian Cake Shop at No. 134 Caishi Road, who sold the cakes. He is currently under interrogation.</p>
<h3>Monk Sentenced to Six Months for Smoking Morphine</h3>
<p>The abbot of Gaoming Temple, Jichai (also known as Jiyan), located at No. 141 Shanhai Road, was addicted to smoking opium. Recently, Chinese Detective Yue Chen of the Xinzha Police Department discovered that the temple had conspired with a Korean Ronin named Jin Lihuan to sell morphine and run a gambling den. He reported it to the police department and requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant. They went to the address and searched, but the Korean Jin Lihuan had already fled after hearing the news. Then they went to the abbot Jichai's room and saw Jichai and another abbot from Xiamen Road, using the alias Changhua, smoking morphine inside. They found two opium lamps and pipes, some gambling den slips, and a lot of evidence of selling drugs on the spot. However, because the principal offender Jin Lihuan was at large, the two monks were only escorted to the First Special District Court for prosecution on charges of smoking drugs. After Judge Xiao Xiefen concluded the trial and a forensic doctor confirmed that Jichai was deeply addicted to drugs, he announced the verdict yesterday, sentencing Monk Jichai to six months of imprisonment, commutable to a fine of two yuan per day. Monk Changhua's portion of the evidence was insufficient, and he was declared innocent and released.</p>
<h3>Fake Police Expel Squatters</h3>
<p>At a small teahouse opened by Jiangbei native Xiao Dizi at the intersection of Haige Road and Fahuadong Town, someone was found gambling the day before yesterday afternoon. Wei, a patrol officer of the town's fake police, learned of this and led more than ten fake police to arrest the gamblers. Unexpectedly, the gamblers were aggressive and resisted arrest, severely injuring Wei and the fake police. After Japanese military police learned of this and rushed to the scene, the gamblers had already dispersed. They then searched the nearby shacks one by one and arrested seven suspects on the spot. They also ordered all squatters in the area (east from Haige Road, south to Lujia Road, west to the Fahua Port, and north to the main street) to move out voluntarily within three days, or they would set fire to them. The squatters were panicked after hearing this, but under the iron heel, they were powerless to resist. Most of them are poor refugees from other provinces, totaling more than 300 families. Therefore, starting yesterday, they have been moving out of the "bad land" one after another. Tables, chairs, and miscellaneous items were piled up on both sides of Lujia Road. Men, women, and children stood in the heat, temporarily without a place to live, a very miserable situation.</p>

<h3>National Higher Education Construction Equipment: School Buildings Worth 65 Million, Equipment Worth 21 Million</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Special Dispatch) The construction equipment of national colleges and universities has expanded considerably in the ten years before the war. For example, Sun Yat-sen University in the south, Tsinghua University in the north, and Wuhan University in the central region are representative examples of higher education material construction in terms of the grandeur of their school buildings and the abundance of their equipment, which were built and completed in the ten years before the war. (The school buildings and equipment of Northeastern University and Yanjing University are also very grand.) The equipment added to other schools is also quite impressive. The average annual addition of construction equipment in these ten years was more than 6 million yuan. According to the total value of school buildings of 108 schools nationwide before the war, it was more than 65 million yuan, the total value of equipment was more than 21 million yuan, and the total number of books was more than 5.5 million volumes. The breakdown is as follows: (1) "School Building Value": National schools 21,039,511 yuan, provincial and municipal public schools 5,057,210 yuan, private schools 31,034,119 yuan, totaling 57,400,840 yuan. (2) "Number of Books": National schools 2,015,230 volumes, provincial and municipal public schools 674,136 volumes, private schools 2,855,374 volumes, totaling 5,544,740 volumes. (3) "Equipment Value": National schools 8,625,473 yuan, provincial and municipal public schools 2,422,284 yuan, private schools 7,932,042 yuan, totaling 18,979,799 yuan. (Note) Among the 108 schools, 7 schools have not yet reported, and their numbers are not included. Therefore, the value of school buildings should be more than 65 million yuan, and the value of equipment should be more than 21 million yuan. As for the destruction or looting of schools after the war, the severe damage to 14 schools, the inability of 17 schools to continue operating, and the relocation of 77 schools, as well as the loss of property and books, and the Ministry of Education's efforts to gradually replenish the schools and the newly added schools have been reported in this newspaper one after another, so I will not repeat them here.</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission's Circular to All Counties: Promoting Military Service Education as an Integral Part of Administration</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) The Military Affairs Commission has issued a circular to all county governments instructing them to relay to central elementary schools and people's education centers to promote military service education, and has promulgated measures to be strictly followed and implemented. The details of these measures are as follows: (1) These measures are specifically formulated to utilize educational forces and existing educational institutions to assist in resolving military service issues within the shortest possible timeframe. (2) Each city and county should divide the areas where schools, private schools, and social education institutions are located into several military service education zones. Each zone should have a school, private school, or social education institution as its center. All teachers, students, and staff of the private education institutions, except for those who are too young, shall serve as military service guides. The principals of schools, the heads of private schools, or the heads of social education institutions shall concurrently serve as the directors of their respective zones, responsible for promoting and guiding military service education. (3) The director of military service education, together with the military service promoters in the zone, shall investigate the actual number of able-bodied men in the zone. Each promoter shall be responsible for counseling a certain number of men. (4) In addition to able-bodied men, the counseling should also focus on their parents and wives, so that they can understand the meaning of military service and assist in the implementation of military administration. (5) Promoters are not limited to students of schools and private schools or social education students. Any enthusiastic patriotic citizen, including parents or wives of able-bodied men, regardless of age or gender, who possess strong capabilities or influence, may be hired as promoters and given letters of appointment to encourage them. (6) The method of promoting military service education should be based on inherent human instincts, starting from the perspective of the people's own interests, using rational propaganda to enlighten their awareness of resistance, and employing emotional cultivation to stimulate their anti-Japanese sentiments, making them see death as returning home and dedicating their lives to the country. (7) In addition to slogans, leaflets, wall newspapers, pamphlets, films, and broadcasts, tools for promoting military service education should also include stimulating illustrations. (8) The promotion of military service education should consider the four types of methods: assembly, training, meeting, visiting and exhibition, and use them according to the situation. It is necessary to conduct military service education without violating the living conditions of the people and improve the efficiency of military administration. (9) Use the power of education to build public opinion and create a trend, so that fathers encourage their sons and elder brothers encourage their younger brothers to regard joining the army and killing the enemy as the highest glory in life. (10) Secondary schools and above should add courses on military service propaganda. Elementary schools and private schools should use methods of military service propaganda as supplementary teaching materials, which will be purchased and taught by teachers. (11) The work of military service education shall be one of the criteria for evaluating the qualifications of school faculty, private school teachers, and social education personnel. The students who serve as promoters will be regarded as part of their academic performance. Those who perform well will be given certificates and medals for encouragement. (12) The central education and military affairs departments will oversee the promotion of military service education. Each province will be responsible for its implementation by the Provincial Department of Education and the military control zones of each province. Each county will be responsible for the matter by the administrative inspector commissioner, the county magistrate, the resident division and regimental control zone, and the county high school. All levels must earnestly supervise the implementation and assess the performance of military service education. This kind of supervision will be one of the criteria for evaluating the performance of the educational authorities and military service authorities of each province and county.</p>

<h3>Finance: September Spot Exchange Sales are Again Prevalent</h3>
<p>Swap Trading Becoming Tighter; Interest on Arbitrage is Slight</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market showed no change in listed rates for the British and American currencies. Only the German currency was reduced by half a mark. As the European situation becomes increasingly critical and the possibility of a second world war is imminent, general import trading houses in the city that deal in German goods are drawing lessons from the first world war. Because of the pre-purchase of German goods, they all made a fortune, and no one regarded the coming situation as a chance. Therefore, recently, many people have settled German exchange and placed orders for German goods, which has become increasingly common. In the black market for British and American exchange, the exchange rate has turned downwards again, affected by the increasingly tense European situation. The price fell sharply by one corner and one cent and eight points. As a result, the morning opening of the black market in the city showed a sign of the British currency being flat and the American currency being tight. The British gold was still at 3 shillings 96875, and the American currency was only at 7 yuan 0625. The situation in the middle of the day was still very sluggish, but the market atmosphere was still active. In the morning, due to rumors on the market that Germany and Poland had opened fire, Chinese merchants dumped British gold in the front, and Hong Kong power sales followed. However, because foreign banks such as HSBC still had unlimited demand for British gold at 4 shillings, the high and low price differences on that day were still very small. As a result, British gold closed at 3 shillings 984375 and American currency closed at 7 yuan 125. Because Jinri Zhengjin and British banks first dumped favorably one after another, and foreign banks' appetite was not healthy, the September period was quite severe, and finally, British currency was hard at 15625 and American currency was cheap at 0625. Therefore, swap trading became tighter, British gold was only 046875 away, and the American currency was only 1875 away, which is about equal to a monthly interest rate of 2 cents and 6 points (excluding commission). In reality, it is still difficult for arbitrageurs to obtain it. The entire day's trading was still brisk.</p>
<h3>HSBC Lists the German Exchange Rate as the Only One Reduced</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the recent London rate was reduced by 625, the repayment period fell by 375, the New York silver price was reduced by 1 point, the London raw gold price was increased by 6 points, the British exchange rate against the US dollar was sharply reduced by one corner and one cent, and the rate against Shanghai was not changed. Against France, the price increased by 13 centimes. The US dollar against the British pound fell sharply by 8 points, against Shanghai it fell by one corner, and against France it was reduced by 4.5 points. The central listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 3 shillings 96875 for British gold and 7 yuan 0625 for American currency, which was flatter for British currency and tighter for American currency by 1875 compared to the previous closing price. The reason for this was that the British and American exchange rates had shrunk again. After the opening, foreign firms slightly settled in. Foreign banks quoted 3 shillings 96875 for British gold and 7 yuan 0625 for American spot exchange, which seemed to be calm. It was not until HSBC announced its listed rates that only the German exchange rate was reduced by half a mark, while the rest remained unchanged. After the balance tax on silver was announced, it was still exempt. After that, the market became even more sluggish and there was no change. It was not until after 11 o'clock that a certain bank sold spot American exchange to its peers for 7 yuan 09375. Then, Jinri Zhengjin sold 9-month British gold to foreign banks for 3 shillings 875. At that time, Huayi blew into the 9-month American exchange rate for 6 yuan 9375 to its peers. Later, foreign banks such as HSBC absorbed spot British gold from Chinese merchants at 4 shillings, causing the spot prices to harden slightly. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 3 shillings 984375 for British gold and 7 yuan 125 for American currency, which was 015625 looser for British currency and 0625 harder for American currency compared to the morning opening.</p>
<h3>Spot Closing Shows British Currency Looser, American Currency Tighter</h3>
<p>In the afternoon market, foreign firms continued to settle spot American currency from North China for 7 yuan 0625. Later, foreign banks did a 9-month American currency trade for 6 yuan 9025. The market was quite flat. Later, the Hong Kong Exchange abruptly spat out spot British gold to HSBC, McGill, and Huabi for 4 shillings. Then, the British bank Youli sold spot American currency to a certain North China bank for 6 yuan 9375 on behalf of its clients. The situation was still extremely stable. Until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was 3 shillings 984375 for British gold and 7 yuan 125 for American currency. The 9-month British gold was 3 shillings 9375, and the American currency was 6 yuan 9375. As a result, the spot British currency was slightly harder by 015625 compared to the previous day, while the American currency was softer by 125. The 9-month British currency was looser by 15625, and the American currency was also cheaper by 0625. The opening and closing transactions of the day are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Market Fluctuates Only Slightly</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 1st - The exchange market opened uncertainly today.

<h3>Tianjin-Shanghai Exchange Rate Still Without a Market</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 1st - There is still no market for the Tianjin exchange rate. However, it is heard that various banks have slightly traded and are handling it at their discretion based on the Shanghai exchange rate.</p>
<h3>European Situation Deteriorates, the Gold Market Cannot Support</h3>
<p>The price fell by 40 yuan; more than 1,000 taels were transacted.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cash exchange market was trending tighter in the morning, continuing the momentum of the previous day. Later, due to the control of the European situation, it turned downwards. As a result, it fell by 40 yuan. At the beginning, the opening was prosperous due to the vigorous buying of a certain securities firm, coupled with a lack of sellers. The morning opening immediately reached a peak of 1,160 yuan. Later, the news that the European situation turned unfavorable came, so people's hearts were weak and difficult to revive. The trend then turned sharply downwards. In the afternoon, the Berlin Telegraph reported that Germany used "force against force," which made people even more uneasy. Most operators held the belief that a European war would break out. Multiple longs such as a certain gold shop and another securities firm competed to liquidate, and retail investors also took the same steps. Therefore, the decline was very strong, and the price once plummeted to a low of 4,015 yuan. The price stabilized slightly at the close, closing at 4,035 yuan. There were many twists and turns in the middle, but there were no major waves. Trading was brisk throughout the day, with more than 1,000 taels transacted. Silver jewelry followed suit, first rising and then falling, and finally falling by 5 yuan. The customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to rise.</p>
<h3>Spot Cash Exchange Approaching the 4,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Since the morning, the initial price was 85 yuan higher due to the momentum of the previous day, the softening of the US dollar, and the surge in absorption by securities firms. The opening price was at 1,160 yuan, which was the highest price of the day. After the opening, the foreign exchange rate was quite flat. General retail investors took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the longs that another securities firm had entered the previous day also came out. In addition, buyers were watching, and the market turned down sharply. Soon after, it fell back by 50 yuan. A money exchange business sold 10 taels to a gold shop for 4,100 yuan. At that time, a certain Yu shop came to absorb it slightly, and the price once recovered to a high of 4,135 yuan. Thereafter, rumors that the European situation turned unfavorable caused the market to decline. Certain silver shops and jewelry firms fought to sell, and the price broke into the 4,100 yuan mark. A money exchange business sold 10 taels to a gold shop for 4,081 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange business purchased on behalf of its clients, and a certain jewelry firm (on behalf of a Hong Kong firm) also slightly satisfied its appetite, and then pulled the price up to 4,105 yuan. At 11:10, it was heard that the foreign exchange rates had hardened slightly, so selling was aroused again. In addition to a certain money exchange business slightly absorbing, the rest were mostly on the sidelines, and the market lacked maintenance. The price plummeted by 45 yuan. A money exchange business entered 20 taels of cash into a gold shop for 4,060 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop entered 2 taels of jewelry, which was called 1,070 yuan. Then, the jewelry firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange business for 4,065 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, a gold shop sold 50 taels to its peers and securities firms for 4,060 yuan. At that time, the securities firm continued to absorb the livestock, and a certain jewelry firm also followed suit, raising the price by 30 yuan. Securities firms and a certain jewelry firm entered 30 taels into the money exchange business for 4,090 yuan. After that, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was stable and hard, and the shorts and other securities firms and gold shops were coming to sell. In addition, buyers were in short supply, and the price plummeted by 75 yuan. Securities firms and gold shops sold 30 taels to money exchange firms for 4,015 yuan. Later, the money exchange business first had some appetite, but the sellers were already waiting and watching, so they recovered slightly. The cash gold shop entered 10 taels into the money exchange business for 4,035 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 40 yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that after the closing, a securities firm sold 30 taels to a money exchange business for 4,025 yuan. The price fluctuated by 145 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold shop's wooden sign gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot cash exchange, and the current bid gold price was 65 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but both were rarely traded.</p>
<h3>Silver Jewelry Prices Expected to Rise but Fall Instead</h3>
<p>The price of silver jewelry per tael was initially suspended at 415 yuan by the major firms. At 9:30, the price was increased by 5 yuan. At 11:05, it fell back by 5 yuan. At noon at 12:00, it fell again by 5 yuan. After that, there were no changes. It is calculated that the major firms changed the suspended price to 410 yuan, and the new firms changed it to 408 yuan, reducing the incoming price by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>British Pure Gold Continues to Rise by 6 Pence</h3>
<p>London, 31st - British pure gold continued to rise by 6 pence per ounce due to the weakening of British currency and the ambiguity of the European situation. The price rose to 7 pounds and 19 shillings, causing the central bank's Chinese cash purchase price to rise again to 1,297 yuan and 7 jiao. The listed customs gold also rose by 9 li, which is 2 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen, and 5 li. The Shanghai standard bid gold price also rose by 4 yuan and 1 to 1,293 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rises Back, and the Interest Rate Changes to Smaller</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for drafts and bills slightly rebounded. The rate remained at 167 yuan and a half per thousand yuan in the morning. It rose slightly at noon and rose further to 170 yuan in the afternoon, which was 2.5 yuan higher than the previous day. The industry association's interest rate was 1 jiao and 7 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, which was a drop of 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Large Bars Initially Fall Then Stabilize, American and Indian Markets Weak</h3>
<p>London Cable, 31st: The silver market saw selling pressure from Indian and speculative investors, lacking sustained support. Market conditions were weak and sluggish. After closing, it appeared to stabilize slightly. Buyers were willing to purchase at listed prices, while sellers were hesitant. Large silver bars saw a recent decrease of 0.625, while forward contracts fell by 0.375. New York silver cables showed a slight decrease of one cent for US spot prices. Additionally, Bombay silver cables indicated calm conditions in the Indian silver market, with spot prices decreasing by three annas and futures falling by two annas each. Only twenty-five transactions were recorded.</p>
<h3>Compulsory Use of "Huaxing Tickets"</h3>
<p>Small Number of Money Exchange Businesses Have Begun Trading, Foreign Currencies Are All Weak, Only Vietnamese Currency Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies were weak due to renewed tensions in Europe. Although foreign exchange fluctuations were very narrow, the British pound was loose and the American dollar tight, with red discs hovering with a tendency towards weakness. British and American gold pounds were weak, and gold tickets were also soft due to public anxiety and scarce demand. Hong Kong, Singapore, Dutch and other currencies were all weakening. Canadian and Philippine currencies showed small decreases due to the decline in American surplus tickets. Vietnamese currency, driven by demand from Sichuan and Yunnan, trended upward. Japanese gold tickets remained stable at one dollar and seventeen cents. Korean currency saw little supply and demand, remaining at one dollar and five cents. The only unique feature was that "Huaxing Tickets," also known as "Hongkou Tickets," were affected by the Jianghai Customs acceptance. Japanese banks sold them at one dollar and fifty-five cents and bought them back at one dollar and fifty cents. A small number of money exchange businesses have already begun trading due to environmental needs. This unique situation is difficult to avoid and greatly harms our national currency system. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds decrease by three yuan each, British gold tickets decrease by one yuan and thirteen cents, American gold tickets decrease by twenty-five cents, Hong Kong tickets decrease by thirteen cents, Singapore and Dutch tickets decrease by twenty cents each, Vietnamese currency rise by eighteen cents, rupee tickets decrease by twenty cents, Canadian currency decrease by forty cents, Philippine currency decrease by ten cents, Australian gold tickets decrease by one yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic and Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>Suddenly Weak Again, Foreign Stocks Unstable</p>
<p>After a sharp rise in unofficial trading of public bonds over the past three months, the situation turned weak. This was due to the central government's declaration rejecting any mediation, which swept away the atmosphere of peace that had permeated the market in recent days. Consequently, the bulls who had been absorbing bonds successively took profits, while speculative players, sensing an opportunity, became active. This resulted in a lack of support for the market, leading to a decline. In the morning opening, buyers like Tongkang, Dingkang, and Dafeng made efforts to push prices up, and the momentum was initially strong. However, momentum weakened after entering the market, and sellers were eager to supply, causing the market to shift from firm to weak, almost in a straight downward line. In the afternoon, the market became quiet, with few transactions. Although Runli and retail investors continued to sell, companies like Xingyuan, Lianyi, Maotai, and Lianhe showed buying interest, and the stagnation saw a slight rise. As a result, prices generally fell back by seven to eight cents. The volume of transactions was around eight to nine hundred thousand.</p>

<p>Stock trading: Hanyeping Company shares, 500 shares traded at two yuan and three cents per share.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association reported that the strong momentum from the previous day still existed at yesterday's opening. Jardine Matheson cotton mill shares at the price of eighteen yuan and eight cents per share, had quite a demand, other industrial stocks also maintained the original status, but in the afternoon, due to receiving a telegram from Berlin stating that Germany planned to "treat force with force," caused anxiety, leading to selling. Jardine shares were driven down to the eighteen yuan border, and because the bulls resisted, they managed to stand firm, other industrial stocks and rubber shares also encountered the same situation. The trend in the market is dominated by the tense situation in Europe, which is exactly the same as other markets, this is very clear, according to the rubber statistics obtained recently for July, the consumption amount was 85,000 tons, and in June it was 88,000 tons, the total amount of inventory reached 385,000 tons, in June it was 375,000 tons, this increase in inventory is mostly due to the quota countries exporting an extra 11,000 tons, however, this number must be offset by an equal amount of insufficient exports,</p>
<p>London British Far East companies stock, last month on the 31st (Thursday) listed, also saw a soft market, Mercantile Bank shares fell seven shillings and six pence, priced at six and a half pounds, HSBC shares fell five pounds, priced at eighty pounds, Kulim Rubber shares fell three pence, priced at sixteen shillings, the rest remained unchanged, the market had prices but no transactions. Tomorrow (September 1) the stock exchange will be closed for one day due to the evacuation of people in London,</p>

<h3>Chongxin Cotton Mill Pays Dividends</h3>

<h3>Grain: Incoming Goods Gradually Increase, Rice Prices Rise Instead</h3>
<p>Store Inventories Are Empty and Urgent, Due to Procurement</p>
<p>Dugen: Since the market had a turnaround last night, yesterday at the opening, the enthusiasm was still high, customers called out high prices, and since the shops in this street were empty for a long time, they took the opportunity to replenish their stocks, so the situation became tight for a while, and the price of each type of good increased by one or two yuan. Near noon, after a period of rising prices, the shops suddenly became sluggish, so the market situation in the evening was weak, and the price had a tendency to fall back. It is said that the sources from all roads that were previously blocked by wind and rain can arrive in port one after another, and there are also many floods in the route, it will be difficult to maintain the price, and it will be necessary to seek quick sales. Yesterday, a total of eleven boats of Songjiang and Nangang goods arrived downstream, and there were more than 5,000 packages of cartwheel steamed buns. The total number of transactions on the market was more than 7,000 packages, including Kaigao Xijing, thirty-one yuan, fell to twenty-nine yuan, Sutong Kun Jing twenty-nine yuan, Dongsheng twenty-six and a half yuan, fell to twenty-four and a half yuan, early and late rice downstream twenty-seven yuan to twenty-six yuan, original package twenty-eight yuan, Chen Wu Jian special twenty-six yuan, twenty-five and a half yuan, Xin Po twenty-three four yuan, Po Jian twenty-one two yuan, Jiangbei Xin Jian twenty-five and a half yuan to twenty-five yuan, Jiashan Jiaxing Xin Chuan Jian twenty-three and a half yuan, Tuan Jian twenty-six yuan, Yang Jian twenty-six yuan, Du Jian twenty-five six yuan, Bian Yuan Gao twenty-six yuan, Medium twenty-five yuan,</p>
<p>Ke Xian: Yesterday, sources from all roads still arrived continuously, with 4-5000 packages of new and old Xian arriving in Shanghai. However, the owners did not relax prices due to the cost of production in the place of origin. Apart from goods in transit, new procurement from Jiangbei was difficult to clear. Transportation from the Beijing-Wu region was difficult. Yesterday, the market planned to maintain a wait-and-see attitude. Due to the recent decline of 12-13 yuan, rice shops have resumed business. The low price of Xian rice was welcomed by shops and retailers in this street. Store inventories were empty and willing to buy. The total number of Xian transactions on the market was about 5,000 packages, with prices rising by one or two yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Stabilizes, Wheat Market Has Daily Factory Touches</h3>
<p>The existing flour market has stabilized, mainly because since the return of goods recently fell sharply, speculators have taken a small amount at a low price, sales in this street have also increased slightly compared to before, and after hearing that rice prices have fallen and risen, the return of the single in the market has been less outflow, the seller's intention has gradually stabilized, No. 2 Flour Factory disk is still six yuan and two cents in cash, the return of goods selling price is five yuan and eight nine cents, the difference is still three to four cents, the total number of transactions on the market is more than 10,000 packages, the future is still difficult to expand.</p>
<p>The source of wheat, the various goods on the cartwheel counted, continue to have more than 10,000 packages, Huachang Import, has been stagnant for many days, all because of poor flour sales, only relying on the Japanese factory sporadic purchases, so the seller is still not short of people seeking to escape, the market continues to show a state of preparation, yesterday's market only hoarding households slightly touched Changzhou wheat three cars, the price is eight yuan five cents four points to five points, compared to the previous drop of about half a yuan, I heard that the price of each goods is eight yuan five cents eight points,</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Southern Gorgon Fruit Out of Stock, New Crop Poor Harvest</h3>
<p>Southern pond gorgon fruit, because the production stock has been cut off, the source has been lacking for a long time, so the goods on the market have also been sold out, and I heard that this year's new goods are still showing a poor image, now the pond gorgon market stock is also rare, Jinghao goods sell for eighty yuan, a slight reduction.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: New Tong Cotton Dumping Has Opened, Delivery Price to Factory Is 110 Yuan</h3>
<p>Although the transaction of this cotton is not very prosperous, it is more active than before, but the factory's purchase is still stagnant, because the yarn price is still in a state of wandering, so it is still watching the raw materials, but Shenxin Factory bought 300 pieces of Indian cotton, and no other transactions have been made, according to some cotton merchants, the import price of foreign cotton has increased again because the customs has changed the tax collection to "Huaxing Currency", the source of the Soviet north, a total of 190 packages of Tongzhou cotton, and 460 packages of forks and north sands, the situation is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Packed fine villi 107.00, fellow industry enters 140 pieces, spot cash store delivery</p>
<p>Fire machine 23.00, again 200 pieces, again and again</p>
<p>White Luo to 130.00, Shenxin factory enters 300 pieces, cash delivery to factory</p>
<p>Another message from Shanghai, the transaction of foreign cotton has been very quiet in recent days, yesterday's exchange rate was tight again, yesterday the customs gold was forced to be converted into 3 yuan 9 cents 2 and a half legal currency per customs gold, the import tax on raw cotton per load needs to be paid 9 yuan a corner, which is 3 yuan 6 and a half cents more than in the past, so the industry's intention is more enthusiastic, the factory is temporarily watching, but Tongzhou new cotton, the industry has already begun to dump, the delivery price to the factory in October is set at 110 yuan, the factory has already made a deal.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Rise Weak, Double Horse Has Been Greatly Changed From the Past</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a state of hesitation, at first because of the saying that the customs tax revenue will be changed to "Huaxing Currency", the industry came to collect again, the market situation was once tight, but the 20-count Double Horse yarn, which has always been regarded as the standard, is still weak, in fact, the price is more expensive than other yarns, too far away, so consumers temporarily changed to buy 20-count Double Globe Tiannv and other yarns instead, so the situation of Double Horse yarn is particularly desolate, the current yarn market, opening high and closing low all day long, the trend is still there</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, in the early morning, the market price was relatively higher due to the purchase of speculators after a partial empty pair to compensate, and overseas cotton merchants had a high stomach, and later the Liverpool news was good, so the New York cotton market was very firm until the close, the result was 3 or 4 points higher than the previous day, India rose two and a half rupees, Egypt rose more than ten pounds, Liverpool rose sixteen cents, hovering in the middle.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened very tight in the morning, and the Hong Kong gang bought 100 packages of "10-count" yarns, and the price immediately jumped up ten yuan to six hundred and three yuan, but there was a lack of inquiries about Double Horse yarn, but the shouting price was chaotic and the bargaining was very high, but there were few eaters, and the opening price was six hundred and sixty-seven yuan, also jumped eight yuan, a little while floating more out of the file, suddenly fell to six hundred and fifty-five yuan, twelve yuan in an instant, other brands were also small three, four, five yuan, and then the buyers were still strong, and then returned to four or five yuan, but the return of Double Horse was insufficient, after checking the statistics of half-day transactions, one thousand four hundred and fifteen packages, the market Double Horse was flat, Double Globe rose nine yuan, Tiannv rose seven and a half yuan, Shepherd rose eight yuan, today there are 60 pieces of yarn transported to Hong Kong, 40 pieces transported to Tule, 40 pieces transported to Saigon, 50 pieces transported to Bangkok, and 50 pieces transported to Singapore, the amount bought by each gang is listed on the left.</p>

<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's colored cloth, colored twill, and serge sales increased slightly, and the native cotton cloth will use "Huaxing Coupons" to pay customs duties and unified taxes, which is an increase in taxes in disguise, which will directly and indirectly increase the cost, so the market is firm, and cheap goods in this street continue to be absorbed, yesterday's opening price is mostly flat, Subei Bengbu and Longhai Line Shangqiu and other places, bought more than 3,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, and printed goods, Yongbang handled nearly one hundred boxes of colored twill and colored cloth, Sichuan and Yunnan bought two thousand several hundred bolts of colored cloth, khaki, and line tweed, overseas Hong Kong gang was also slightly active, bought more than 30 pieces of fine twill, coarse twill, and poplin, Singapore and Siam bought 3,600 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and printed goods, this street traded more than 6,000 bolts of line tweed, serge, and various greige fabrics.</p>

<h3>"Pillars of Society and Enemies of the People"</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>Scholars in the imperial examination era truly believed that there were golden houses in books, ten thousand bushels of millet in books, jade-like beauties in books... and other theories of the purpose of reading. Teleology cannot be separated from the concept of utilitarianism. The ultimate purpose of reading is for fame and fortune. This was the central concept of most readers in the past. Although it was said to serve the country, honestly speaking, it was still for the individual, the family, and the clan. Therefore, in old novels of the "talented scholar" type, there were often poor scholars who studied hard for ten years, first falling into poverty in the capital, but suddenly being named on the golden list, with the emperor's imperial examination, receiving a golden flower, and after touring the Forbidden City, the first thing was to complete the marriage by imperial decree, realizing the initial stage of "there is a jade-like beauty in books." Then, they would exploit the people and acquire extensive fields and houses, successively realizing the "golden house" and "ten thousand bushels of millet." At that time, the goals of readers were quite simple and clear. The encouragement to seek knowledge was just a few words about "there is..." in books.</p>
<p>Although today's "scholar-officials" have cut off their queues, they have not cut off their personal utilitarianism. Therefore, although today's educational purpose is to create national talents and pillars of society to serve the country and society, in the minds of most "officials," they still cannot get rid of the concept of "there is... in books." Let's not talk about elementary or middle school students who only have the ability (of course, referring to financial ability) to read and obtain the qualifications of a child student or a scholar; in the current cultural state of China, this group of people is forming a gear in the social operational function. Let's look at young people with the financial ability to attend high school and university. In their compositions and essays, they may talk grandly about serving the country and so on. However, although China is large and society needs many talents in various fields, there are not many careers that today's readers are willing to serve. Customs recruitment—"rushing to it," post office recruitment—"frightened by it," civil service examinations and aviation school recruitment are still "full of talent," but apart from a few institutions regarded as golden rice bowls, the rest, although also national institutions—or more important in nature, although also having a surplus of people, I am afraid are not what our readers today aspire to. Because the treatment of most social undertakings, if it allows you to support a yellow-faced wife, live in a small room, and eat white rice, is already very good. However, young people have ambition.</p>
<p>We are not against ambition, no, we support young people's ambition to improve. But we really can't bear to see the aim of this kind of ambition is only to plan to divorce the yellow-faced wife to marry a "jade-like beauty," move from a "small room" to a "front building," or even live in a Western-style house, with unexpected savings in the bank.</p>
<p>"After someone came back from a certain place, they no longer live in the former small room, and I heard that they also bought many new furniture... Classmate so-and-so has been very successful in a certain place recently and has made a fortune..." Such words may make the relatives and friends of "so-and-so" feel that they have been touched by the "residual light" (I have not only heard this saying once or twice, and I even have such relatives and friends!). But I can't help but think of Yixiasheng's play title "Pillars of Society and Enemies of the People."</p>
<h3>Prospects on the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>— Sheng Ri</p>
<p>—War Zone Report</p>
<p>The war on the eastern front has turned silent since the fall of Luan. Apart from a small number of provincial security teams defending Sujiabu, only one battalion of infantry from the 　　Division remained there. Moreover, there were not many troops in Huoshan, Yeji, and the West Boundary Ridge. Because the battle for the periphery of Wuao had entered its final and serious stage, there was naturally no energy left to spy on the side door of the Dabie Mountains, so the eastern front was in a state of stillness. However, in late August, the situation suddenly became tense. The enemy simultaneously invaded from two routes, Yangliudian and Hanbaidu, as usual, first indiscriminately launching artillery fire, followed by armored car offensives. The defending troops calmly blocked and intercepted, while sending urgent telegrams for reinforcements, desperately preserving their original positions. However, the security team, "well-organized and at ease," remained onlookers throughout, perhaps out of cherishing their bullets, even "treasure" their firearms; and when investigated afterward, they used "no orders received" as an excuse to shirk responsibility, otherwise, the other party would have "returned without a single piece of armor."</p>
<p>On the morning we set out for the eastern front, rain seemed to be coming, and distant peaks and nearby hills were swallowed up in dark, dense clouds. The mountain road from Huai Shuwang to Emao Ling was rugged and dangerous, only allowing one horse to pass at a time. Professor Ren, holding the reins of that black donkey, really made you remember Zhang Guolao in the Eight Immortals story. We originally planned to rush to Mabuk for the night, but the rain got heavier and heavier, so we had to stop at Xiaoma Dian for a snack. It was still sixty li from Dushan, and it was expected that we would only arrive tomorrow afternoon. According to the farmers, the plane had already come to reconnoiter several times, but had not yet dropped bombs. Professor Ren seized this opportunity and, like opening a talkative box, began talking to them.</p>
<p>At dawn tomorrow, we will continue eastward. The clear sound of artillery fire roused our spirits. By the time we arrived at Mabuk, the streets were deserted. The shops only opened half their doors. It is said that the more affluent families had already hidden in the deep mountains. This leading town in western Anhui was surrounded by the atmosphere of war, showing a different mood. Crossing Xianghualing, wounded soldiers retreating from the front line, wrapped in rags that had permeated bloodstains, were walking laboriously. There were no transport vehicles, nor stretchers, causing the soldiers who risked their lives for the country to suffer extra pain. How tragic this was!</p>
<p>When we arrived at Lianghekou, we learned that as a result of rapid reinforcements, the front had been very stable. "If the reinforcements hadn't arrived quickly, Shipodian would have been unreliable," everyone said. In fact, the other party's attack on Sujiabu did not have the ability to penetrate deep to the west. If the security team could have attacked at the same time, the eastern front would have been as solid as a rock; moreover, the other party's westward advance was exploratory in nature. If it was really an invasion, we estimate that it would require at least a division to take a risk. How could the invaders, already feeling panicked about the source of troops, have the courage to try?</p>

<h3>Physiognomy</h3>
<p>— Yan Huo</p>
<p>In the old society, a person's appearance was very particular. Standing had a standing posture, sitting had a sitting posture, naturally sleeping had a sleeping posture, and eating also had an eating posture.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I was naughty and didn't sit or stand properly, and my parents would often scold me with a straight face: "Look at your frivolous appearance, you will definitely not be successful in the future!" This is called: "Three years old determines eighty, eight years old determines the rest of your life." When I was hungry, I would of course gobble up food, and immediately "appearance" came again: "What kind of system is this? You're really revealing your poverty!"</p>
<p>In contrast to this, there is the so-called "rich appearance," commonly known as the "God of Wealth appearance." I haven't seen enough of the appearances of such people, so I dare not talk nonsense; but judging from the meaning of the words, they probably always have round faces and big ears, not far from the God of Wealth Bodhisattva enshrined in the temple?</p>
<p>A girl, walking on the road, smiling, and her body twisting a little. If the person who sees her is a physiognomist, then he will be very unhappy and say seriously: "Demon-like, born with a licentious appearance!" However, if the face appears too serious, it will also attract injustice. At this time it is: "Posing, what a lifeless face!"</p>
<p>Women standing straight and walking on the road are like this, and people who bend their backs below ordinary women are even better objects for "fixed appearance theory": Needless to say the appearance of a humble person, even the bones are humble—black slaves are recorded in the notes of the ancients that, in addition to the skin, the layer under the flesh is never white, or even gray. Regardless of evidence and me, this "non-facial" theory that directly penetrates the internal essence from the surface phenomenon can indeed make people get a big surprise. However, there are also facts, for example: the hands of old women who rely on washing clothes for a living are very rough, and the feet of rickshaw pullers who are good at running are thin and large. They are very ordinary, they are all destined. This is also a good supplement in "palmistry" and "foot physiognomy": their suffering is not prominent, that is because of the trouble of bad hands and feet. Based on this, the colored nails of modern girls and the socks of civilized gentlemen are naturally unnecessary.</p>
<p>Recently, a certain newspaper made copper plates of the hand photos of Hitler and Mussolini and published them to the world to promote "palmistry," which is also very plausible. But unfortunately, if you look at the hands of Mr. Xi (or Mr. Mo), they are not as smooth as soft荑, on the contrary, they are also very rough, not much different from those of rickshaw pullers. Perhaps it was because he used his hands too much when he was engaged in the lacquerware business before (Mr. Mo also robbed bread on the street in his early years); however, the palmist of a certain newspaper finally identified that this hand was indeed the hand of a great man: this line is what pattern, and that root is what road, and even his annexation of Czech Bohemia (or Abyssinia and Albania) can be seen from this—rough? Not rough! One hand covers the eyes of the people of the world, and he is acclaimed as "Long Live"!</p>
<p>In fact, it is not necessary for a few people to brag about the "Long Live Physiognomy." Some street heroes have already been practicing it unswervingly. If you want to ask for advice, he will definitely give you a look, with his hat tilted and a hand reaching out: "Hey! Friend, know what's good for you!"—This is very rough, perhaps not recorded in the book of physiognomy, but it is also one of the physiognomies.</p>
<p>Alas, Long Live Physiognomy!</p>

<p>Mountains belong to spring, water belongs to autumn; however, one should play in the water in spring and wander the mountains in autumn. Mountains belong to youth, water belongs to old age; however, both the young and old can appreciate the charm of mountains and water. For instance, myself, I cherish mountains and water equally, and love them equally. Occasionally, when I see white smoke rising from the spire of a magnificent building, I feel the charm of the mountains. And sometimes, sitting beside a marble table, I long for the essence of water. I always feel that smoke belongs to mountains, wind belongs to water; mist belongs to mountains, rain belongs to water. The smoke and mist of the mountains, the wind and rain of the water, I am not deliberately exaggerating, they truly symbolize all the emotions and atmosphere of the human world without omission.</p>
<p>For two years, I have not traveled to the mountains and waters, and my refined interests have long been eroded by the dust and smoke of the mundane world. I remember a poet saying: "Traveling the mountains is tempering the body with silver, traveling the waters is tempering the mind with silver." But I think he was only half right. I like water more than mountains, but I have to admit that there is also a poetic realm in the mountains. There is an old French song that says: "The wife of the mountain is water," then the mountain is male and the water is female. The feelings of husband and wife sometimes create a balance in the fusion of the two sexes.</p>
<p>Living in the city, there are neither mountains nor water. The desire to love mountains and water has gradually become perverse, turning into a greedy desire for "possession." Everyone has the idea of "possession," but also the emotion of "appreciation"; the strength of the two depends entirely on the scenery outside the eyes. The melting pot of the city is completely different from the mountains and waters. Some people think that mountains and water are a refuge from reality; in fact, mountains and water are a good place to "temper" humanity! The poet's "Traveling the mountains is tempering the body with silver, traveling the waters is forging the mind," whether it is half right or completely right, there is always some truth in it. The life of a nation does not lie in the colorful city, but in the mountains and flowing water. Cities can be reduced to ashes in an instant, but mountains and water can truly exist as long as the sun and moon. Indeed, our ancient country has a deep love for mountains and water. Even in the age of war, the sublimity of the mountains and the torrents of water represent the spirit of our ancient country!</p>
<p>Friends who work in the interior always mention the beautiful scenery of mountains and waters in their letters. This is not necessarily a kind of demonstration to me; but I would rather surrender to this demonstration. I have been fried enough in the melting pot, even a few words on paper can satisfy my dream of mountains and water in the way that looking at plums quenches thirst. Isn't it true that I often immerse myself in the memories of past travels, rechewing old dreams? As for the sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy tastes, please forgive me for not being able to distinguish them clearly, and I have nothing to tell you.</p>
<p>"At your age, you should run to the mountains to work." Someone said this. Yes, not only do I think so, but I also hope to sail a small boat and drift to the ocean! Friends, what do you think?</p>

<h3>### Xin Yanqiu, Zhang Eyun and Hou Yulan</h3>
<p>— Duo</p>
<p>Recently, regardless of amateur or professional actresses who study female roles, they all regard the Cheng school as the standard. However, those who can grasp its essence and comprehend its true meaning are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. If there are any, they are only three, all of whom are female performers: one is Xin Yanqiu, one is Zhang Eyun, and one is Hou Yulan. Xin Yanqiu's original name was Wang Yuhua. She first came to Shanghai in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China and joined the Danggui First Stage, becoming famous with a single performance. At that time, the person playing the qin for her was her own brother. Her brother had once followed Cheng Yanqiu, and his qin playing was clear, crisp, and fluent, which was quite appreciated. Yuhua's learning from Cheng was due to this relationship. At that time, many female performers learned from Mei Lanfang, but Yuhua, as a seventeen-year-old girl, uniquely followed the Cheng style, with both her singing and dialogue shedding the sharp tones of a woman. Even her expressions and gestures were all remarkably similar, so it is no wonder that she caused a sensation. She came to Shanghai again in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, her reputation increased tenfold, and her skills also improved rapidly. Later, she performed in Nanjing at the same time as her teacher, Cheng Yanqiu, and her box office appeal was on par with his. However, after this, she encountered many setbacks and was repeatedly tormented by her environment. Last winter, at the Jixiang Theater in Beiping, she suffered an even greater shock. She is now living in Tianjin, and it is unknown when she will reappear on the red stage. The path of the world is difficult, and I cannot help but feel worried for the general female performers.</p>
<p>Zhang Eyun became famous after Xin Yanqiu, but her qualifications and experience are more profound than those of the new performer. She had no reputation at first, but later hired Mu Tiefen as her qin teacher, and her singing style changed to follow Cheng Yanqiu, and thus she became famous throughout the country with a single performance. Eyun's voice is not as good as Yuhua's, but her singing is clear, crisp, and fluent, with a tinkling sound, which is indeed a special talent. Coupled with Mu Tiefen's qin playing, when singing Erhuang and Anti-Erhuang operas, it is mournful and desolate, like weeping and complaining, as if a gibbon is wailing, and it shatters people's hearts. Eyun's stage presence is also very beautiful, walking lightly like a swallow, showing the depth of her footwork. Her gestures are natural, but she is too casual, far less dignified than Yanqiu. And those who learn from Yanqiu must pay attention to Yanqiu's dignity.</p>
<p>Hou Yulan, as the top student of the Beiping Opera School, came south with Yan Jupeng this time, first performing in Huangjin. Since the school was founded by Yanqiu, its students who study female roles must mostly follow the Cheng school. Yulan is a top student of Wu Fuqin. Fuqin has followed Yanqiu for a long time, and Fuqin knows Yanqiu's singing, dialogue, and gestures most exquisitely. Yulan was influenced by Fuqin and often received personal guidance from Yanqiu, so her study of Cheng must be more profound than that of Yuhua and Eyun. Moreover, she herself studies diligently, so her achievements are excellent. This time she came south, and I have gone to listen to several performances, and I feel that her art is indeed extraordinary. Her voice is higher than Eyun's, similar to Yuhua's, and when she turns to high notes, she goes straight to the clouds. She is also good at using the back-of-the-head voice. Her voice is sufficient. Her dialogue has no trailing sounds, which is her unique creation, but the girl's voice has not been completely removed. Her gestures and movements are agile and dignified. Her water sleeve skills are beautiful and unrestrained, better than Eyun and Yuhua. Indeed, a pair of eyes, clear and bright as water waves, are most moving. Her appearance is charming and beautiful. It is a pity that her teeth are not very white, although they are even. She can perform few plays, and her stage presence is still shallow. It is expected that when she comes to Shanghai again next time, she will definitely make unexpected progress and gain supreme honor.</p>
<p>Among these three, Eyun is the oldest, followed by Yuhua, and Yulan is the youngest. Among the three, Yulan's learning process is the easiest. Eyun, with the assistance of Mu Tiefen, also has a more systematic way to learn. As for Yuhua, she once had the intention of taking Yanqiu as her teacher, but Yanqiu declined her politely to avoid suspicion. Therefore, Yuhua's study of Cheng entirely relies on her intelligence and devoted imitation, which is the most difficult of the three. In terms of the three's art, Yuhua's learning of Cheng is the most lifelike, but she has been repeatedly tormented in recent years, and her performance may be diminished. Eyun's singing and acting are both excellent, but she lacks dignity. Yulan is the youngest, and her art is also reaching the top level. Although there are still shortcomings, as long as she continues to improve, her future is unlimited.</p>
<h3>### "Ying Lian's" Second Play - Who is Chen Bailu</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>——Lan Lan? Xu Tianren? Li Yang</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan's "Ying Lian" premiered at the Lafayette Theater yesterday. It is exactly the planned Cao Yu trilogy—Thunderstorm, Sunrise, and Wilderness—starting from the beginning. Each play will be performed for a week. Now "Thunderstorm" is on. "Wilderness" does not need to be restaged, because when it was performed in French, it was all Guohua actors, such as Shushi's Chou Hu, Zhou Manhua's Jinzi, Mona's Jiao Dama, and Zhou Qi's Chang Wu. Only Qiao Qi's Daxing has a problem, but it is only a matter of adjusting one actor, which is not a big deal; and it is the third play, so there is no need to rush. What is urgently being rehearsed now is "Sunrise." The role of Chen Bailu has been agreed upon with Lan Lan, but Lan Lan is re-performing "Tears on Flowers" at the Xuan Palace. In "Tears on Flowers," Lan Lan plays Mimi. She is also rushing to film "Women's Apartment" at Yi Hua. Perhaps she won't have the time to spare in a hurry. So the role of Chen Bailu fell to Xu Tianren, who was a former actress at the Central Photography Studio. However, according to the news I received yesterday, they have gone from Xu Tianren to contacting Li Yang. Li Yang is Chen Peipei Yu Zhongfu in the public performance of "Working Women - Women's Apartment." At the same time, the "Shanghai Song" of the Weiming Society also intends to invite Li Yang to play the role of Yuan Jinhua, because "Working Women" originally wanted to perform this play, and Zhang Hao, the composer of "Shanghai Song," rehearsed it for a long time, so she can easily master it. However, "Working Women" is scheduled to publicly perform four short plays on the 24th, so Li Yang may also be unable to spare the time.</p>
<p>Who is Chen Bailu? It's still a mystery.</p>
<h3>Reminiscences on the Revival of "Tears on Flowers" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yu Ling</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Li Jianwu saying this: Once a script is finalized and made public, it is no longer just the author's personal property, but that of society. Therefore, I think that as long as its performance has some significance to society, can fulfill some of the artistic and protective tasks of drama, and achieve some social effects of the performance, even if it is just one act or half an act, it is better than not performing at all.</p>
<p>This time, the Shanghai Drama Society opened in a hurry at the Palace Theater, just as the "August 13th" concessions tightened martial law, making it inconvenient for the audience to go out at night; then came the dangerous international situation and the drastic changes in Shanghai life, coupled with the usual autumn heat, resulting in poor business performance. Repeatedly changing new plays affected the progress of the drama society's rehearsal schedule, so they had to re-perform "Tears on Flowers" and other plays as a form of adjustment, preparing for new works such as "The Lying Family," "Dark Willows and Bright Flowers," and "Love and Intrigue" around the Mid-Autumn Festival. If the re-performance of "Tears on Flowers" can play a slight role in the drama society's turnaround, it would be my unexpected honor. I earnestly seek: not for "Tears on Flowers," but for the drama society, or, to exaggerate a bit, for the performing arts movement suffering in the isolated island!</p>
<p>What can be comforting to the audience is that the Shanghai Drama Society is progressing in difficulty. Director Wu Yonggang also happened to adapt "Tears on Flowers" into a film script, preparing to shoot it after autumn. This time re-rehearsing can help me correct many of the original script's and past performance's shortcomings. Due to the transfer of several roles, the lineup of "Tears on Flowers" has also been refreshed. Thanks to the readers' non-abandonment, the script of "Tears on Flowers" has been sold in two editions. The spread of so-called works with many congenital defects makes me very uneasy. I was bedridden when it was first performed last year, so I was unable to watch the whole thing, so I did not revise the second edition. This time, the complete performance may be enough to encourage me to collect the criticisms of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian and Tang Huaiqiu in Hong Kong for the two performances in Mandarin and Cantonese, and make a revision of the third edition to be printed!</p>
<h3>Paramount Re-shoots "Beau Geste"</h3>
<p>— Paul</p>
<p>"Beau Geste", which once caused a sensation, was adapted from the famous work of Sir Percival Christopher Wren. Now Paramount Pictures specially re-shot it, with Gary Cooper and Ray Milland as the main actors. It will be released in New York on September 1st.</p>
<p>This "Beau Geste" is the greatest of Paramount's major films of the year. There are also 57 other films, with all directors and actors participating. The annual manufacturing budget is set at 30 million US dollars. Among them, "Jamaica Inn" starring Charles Laughton, "The Light That Failed" starring Ronald Colman, and "The Disputed Passage" starring Dorothy Lamour, adapted from famous works, are all worth mentioning.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a Technicolor cartoon "Gulliver's Travels", which is comparable to "Snow White", which is also one of Paramount's great contributions. As for the already completed film "Union Pacific" directed by Cecil B. DeMille, it will meet the people of Shanghai after the autumn cool.</p>
<p>Dance World Photography (38)</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3>Star Six Star Chronicle No. 9 - Shen Weiying</h3>
<p>The poem says, "With a clever smile and beautiful eyes." I say that these two lines seem to be a portrait of Shen Weiying. Weiying's best-looking posture is when she slowly walks from a distance, truly with graceful lotus steps and a slender willow waist, making people fall in love at first sight. But when she sits down close by, it's a bit less impressive. But one step further, after talking to her a few words, I guarantee that you will feel a kind of comfortable energy after hearing her crisp oriole voice, and the dance is also light, indeed a top choice in the dance stars.</p>
<p>(38) Some people say that Weiying has too much airs. But can a dance girl put on airs? Isn't that deliberately going against money? I think Weiying is a smart person and would never do that. Sure enough, she not only doesn't put on airs for a group of money-spending guests, but also intentionally or unintentionally, at any time and any place, she will improvise some sweet words to flatter them. But she is unwilling to give a friendly look to a group of freeloading friends. Think about it, what are they doing as dance girls for? Isn't it to earn money to maintain their lives? Then wouldn't guests who don't give money become fools?</p>
<p>I have seen several dance girls who eat tofu everywhere, not only foreign devils but also petty troublemakers, and also befriend friends who sing Shanghai opera and acrobatics, thinking it is an honor. When the news spreads far and wide, the money-spending guests can't help but flee at the first sign, and then they accidentally encounter a plague god, and they can't help but desperately point them out. But they can only point them out for a while, not for a lifetime. As a result, the red star becomes a purple star, and the purple star becomes a black star. At that time, these neither fish nor fowl friends will also look down on you, making you run around all day long, smelling disgusting. Those who used to eat people's tofu are now offering it to people, but people don't even care. It's really pitiful and not worth regretting. Why bother? Shen Weiying is a truly smart person, maybe she can see this level. Her airs are put on in the right places. Don't underestimate her. In short, if you are not tolerant of others, others will not be tolerant of you. If you specialize in playing with beauties and treat people as fools, you will end up suffering yourself. This is called karmic retribution. If you often stand in the position of an observer and look at it, you can say that it is accurate without the slightest error.</p>
