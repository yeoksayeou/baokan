<p>社評</p>
<h3>法租界禁止懸旗糾紛</h3>
<p>日昨爲國民精神總動員宣傳週的農工商宣傳日，所以上海兩特區各界，都自動懸掛國旗，以表示熱烈奉行的精神。不意法租界內，獨因禁止懸旗，巡捕與市民發生衝突。法租界當局深恐事態擴大，已將國旗發還，被拘市民予以釋放。不幸事件或可告一段落。方情勢緊張之際，法租界市民，大爲憤激，若干商店且有閉門停業者。我們爲敦睦邦交計，爲消釋誤會計，不得不對法當局和市民進一忠吿</p>
<p>法租界的當局與市民，一向是維持着極良好的親切關係；尤其自這次中日戰爭發生以後，法租界爲維持其界內的安髯秩序，嚴守其中立的立塲，使不爲暴力所刼持擾亂，更足予全體市民以莫大的好感。不久以前，法租界中也曾一度發生禁止懸掛國旗的小小糾紛，今又發生同樣事件，我們以爲一切總是出於誤會；但覺得，這個誤會也就太嚴重了。</p>
<p>國旗是代表一個國家的尊榮的，就國際上的禮貌來說，本國人民自由懸掛國旗，友好的國家，勿論如何，也不應該加以干涉。上海租界雖然是特殊區域，但仍是中國的領土，中國人民自由懸掛國旗，也正應如同界內其他國家的人民一樣，又何能加以干涉。以法租界常局的賢明，未必對於這淺顯的道理不明白。或者以爲近來深受所謂「特殊環境」的壓迫，因欲保持界內的安寗秩序，遂不惜出於此種下策，以期遷就特殊方面的意思，我們也未敢深信。</p>
<p>但是我們要爲法租界當局告的；以中法國交近來的特別密切，法國當局當然承認只有中國國民政府才是中國唯一的合法政府，那麼，便不應該阻止中國人民懸掛他們所尊重的唯一合法的國旗，致令在兩國國交上留一不好印象。倘使以爲對於特殊方面的勢力有所顧忌，那也就有失法國傳統的民族俠義自由的精神。法國的民族性向來以抑强扶弱提倡俠義見稱於世。十八世的末期、美國對於英國暴力的抵抗，那時英國大軍壓境，又何讓今日之中國？然而當時法國多少仁人志士，多少正式海陸軍隊，都曾義氣帮助美國的獨立革命戰爭，這種俠義精神，讀史者無不欽佩。法國的政府今正發揮這種精神，在歐洲方面以抑强扶弱爲務，擔任援助波蘭等國抵抗潛能的侵略者，法租界的當局爲何不秉守他們政府的政策待遇界內的市民？</p>
<p>諒來法租界的當局，以近來恐怖團體的活動，也有阻礙上海市民懸掛國旗的警告，深恐釀成事變，有礙市民安全，致有禁阻懸旗之舉，但昨日公共租界中同樣懸掛國旗，何以毫無發生擾亂治安秩序的活動呢？即退一步說，原諒法租界當局的苦心，然在事前應該發一通告，說明勿懸旗的理由，而動之以誠，於是市民自然不致發生誤會。今事前旣未佈吿，那麼，界內的市民在此國民精神總動員宣傳週的農工商宣傳日懸掛國旗，表示他們愛護國家的熱忱，按照常例，旣不違背租界的警章，而又爲國民分所當爲之事，警務當局突然强令市民將他們的國旗卸下，而且當執行公務之時，又難免有魯莽操切的行動，這焉能不激起市民的公憤呢？憶去年公共租界當局，禁止孤軍營的懸掛國旗，終致引起一塲流血；現在孤島中的中國人民，抱孤軍那樣的精神，願以流血而擁護其國旗的，又何止萬倍，稍一應付不當，事變何堪設想，幸昨日法租界的市民還能强抑他們的悲憤，所以只發生小小的衝突，這是値得我們欽佩的，但强抑只能收效於一時，不能維持至長久，我們希望法租界賢明的當局對於這事，當懲前毖後，予以愼重的考慮，覓取使界內市民滿意的辦法。」</p>
<p>最後我們願爲租界中的市民吿的；便是在此非常時期，至盼大衆維持像昨日的忍耐精神與惡劣環境奮鬥。爲着正義，當然不甘屈服；但也不要爲着有所誤會而引起重大的不幸。即如這次事件，上海各公法團除應即向法租界當局提出交涉外，並應即日電請中央遵循外交途徑向法政府鄭重抗議，並要求以後不能再有同樣事件發生。至於意氣的爭持，和風聞將取的罷市等等行動，便應該竭力避免而靜待善後的解決。</p>
<h3>華軍處主動地位　力挫日方攻勢　在廣大陣綫上連續反攻　日兵湖漸竭調新兵作戰</h3>
<p>（重慶）據權威軍事家觀察、華方目前之戰略、在一廣大之陣錢上、作連續之反攻、尤其對於日方兵力他調或薄弱之方面、施以突襲、務使日方不能調集兵力於一點或數點、而進行其再向前進之攻勢、同時使其無力把握已在其掌中之各據點、</p>
<p>又據華方發言人稱、漢水前綫之華軍、現正自西面北面攻擊日軍、藉以阻止日軍自南增援、同時在漢水以東之隨縣等地華軍、現正向東南進攻平漢錢、該錢上之信陽、已在華軍三面圍攻中、</p>
<p>又謂、日方現增援信陽者達五千人、大多新近來自日本者、年齡皆在二十一歲左右、所受之軍事訓練、不過三個月、可見日軍兵源漸竭、無兵可調、僅有徵發未歷戎行之新兵矣、目前在信陽西南、每日皆有激戰、又岳州方面新到日兵數千、或爲日方沿粤漢南攻之準備、同時高安方面之日軍、亦調至武寗方面、</p>
<p>又據探報、現在德州方面有德國顧問一名、及日本軍官十名、正在研究該方面華軍之游擊活動、準備進行所謂其「掃蕩」運動、又據消息稱、日本現正圖沿隴海路進攻、日機三十架轟炸鄭州及山西長冶晋城、卽爲其進攻之序幕、至蘇北宿遷方面、日方現集有大軍、其目的卽在阻止華軍進至魯南、危及日軍之後方云、（十九日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）據此問華方宣稱、中國軍隊在華中開始反攻以來、日軍大起恐慌、連日不斷向漢口及洞庭湖方面運兵增援、原駐山西南部之第二十師團、亦已調往華中、此外日軍沿漢水之進攻、亦被華軍猛力截擊、陷於停頓云、（十九日海通社電）</p>

<p>（重慶）軍委會發言人談、近來各綫、我已屢舉重大戰果、敵疲於奔命、頗現驚惶失措之象、尤以本週以來、南北戰塲、膚功迭奏、斬獲之鉅、規復之多、使國內外視聽爲之一振、而此種勝利趨勢、刻已逐漸展開、敵拚命掙扎之企圖、已被粉碎無餘、雖連日敵妄肆造謠、諱言失敗、然事實勝雄辯、有識者自能知之、茲將作戰經過、摘述於左、</p>

<h3>蘇報論　日本國內局勢　統治階級內部　發生公開衝突</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）此間報紙頃登載論文一篇、檢討日本議會七十四次會議經過、據指陳此次會議暴露了日本統治階級內部之公開衝突、反映了彼等對於工人及農民之日益高漲的怨望情叙之恐慌、緣侵華戰爭之一切困難全由工農大衆担負、過去日本人民心中、曾養成一種日本對華作戰乃爲「無抵抗之勝利」的心理、而今則日軍閥本身竟主張準備「百年戰爭」、</p>
<p>對華作戰益感困難　此種新的冒險之準備、引起了日本議會中一部分議員之恐慌、例如民政黨議員中山對軍人致辭時云、關於所謂「百年戰爭」之準備、量好藏諸心底、而不必在報紙及雜誌上公開宣傳</p>
<p>工資低落物價高漲　日本人民以黷武政策得到之果實如何、可由日本報紙登載之工作時間及工資數字證明、如一九三六年日本工人工銀指數爲一百、則一九三九年一月已降至八五·三、同時、商品零售價格則不斷提高、如一九三二年爲一百、則一九三九年二月底已增至一四二·七、關於工作時間、議會中曾有人聲稱實行十二小時工作日制度、乃不能達到的理想一、</p>
<p>壓迫人民限制消費　關於一切必需品、日本已實行一種値百抽十的特別稅、日本商工大臣正在爲一　切一般消費品規定一種按口分配之卡紙制度、大藏大臣則在議會宣言將「用武力强迫人民限制消費、」</p>
<p>中小產業相繼崩潰　按照日工商省之統計、日本中小產業家破產者已達二六、六六〇名、今後二三個月內、尙有五萬名將遭同樣命運、緣原料缺乏、非戰爭需耍之商品製造减少、</p>
<p>億民負擔日益加重　議會中曾暴露一有趣事實、據稱日本政府不祖負戰死士兵之葬費、因此人民乃不得不繳付一種奇怪的「死之稅」、使失去贍養人之家庭更增重負、</p>
<p>凡此一切、使日本國內發生議員今井稱爲「人民對於官吏（卽政府）之怨憤」的日益增長的怨望情叙、因之日首相平沼竟不得不在議會中承認國內現勢方助成共產主義思想之高漲、（十九日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>林主席電唁</p>
<p>謝持家屬</p>
<p>（重慶）林主席電唁國府委員謝慧生家屬原電云、成都厚生農塲謝委員寓宅謝夫人德堪世兄禮鑒、頃得錦帆、季陸兩同志銑電、驚悉慧生先生逝世之耗、披念先生盡瘁黨國三十餘年、綿歷沉疴、又攖國難、老成徂謝、五內摧傷、惟是勛業騶垂、自堪不朽、尙望以禮節哀、勉襄大事、以慰英靈、是所至盼、林森叩篠印，（十八日電）</p>
<p>晋培華空軍</p>
<p>異常活躍</p>
<p>興集　旬日來、華方神勇空軍、在晋境異常活躍、計八日炸侯馬太原、十日轟太谷、十一日再襲太原、並在榆次投彈多枚、十四日午後二時、華機一架、在絳縣上空盤旋偵察的二十分鐘、始悠然西飛、（十九日電）</p>
<h3>東京朝日新聞載　美將致牒日本　建議解決中日問題方案　日本旣定方針次不接受</h3>
<p>（香港）東京十九日電、朝日新聞載稱、聞美總統羅斯福將於四月底向日本提出牒文、其內容與最近致德義之電報大致相同、說明萬一日本欲召集國際會議、解決遠東問題、則美國願加贊助云云、現英美兩國在海軍方面、已成立諒解、英海軍則集中地中海、美海軍之大部則移往太平洋、故美國頗有向日本提出解決中日事件建議之可能、惟萬一美總統果出此手段、則日本必加以拒絕、根據日政府屢次之宣言、足示日本認爲召集國際會議之方式、旣非有效、亦非適當的穩定正在建立「新秩序」中之東亞局勢之手段云云、今晨外國記者以朝日新聞所載各節詢之日外務省發言人、據答稱報載之事、無非記者之猜想而已、關於美總統致德義之電文事、日發言人拒絕發表意見、某記者問美艦隊逐漸集中太平洋、日方之威想如何、日發言人稱、日本並不注意此事、美海軍之入太平洋、僅係調回原防而已（十九日電）</p>

<h3>英國加強　遠東艦隊實力　張續以較大新艦代舊艦　反侵加入同盟將包括中國</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英駐中國海面之四千二百九十噸巡艦加狄夫號、造成已屆二十二年、今海軍部宣布將此艦於本月底調回、易以更大之巡艦、此事已引起海軍界與關心遠東者之極大興趣、有人預料、新近試駛配備完全之萬噸巡艦愛丁堡號、將被遣往中國、此訊雖未證實、但路透社確知、代替加狄夫號者必爲萬噸巡艦、另一大巡艦康華爾號、刻在赴華途中、同時東印度艦隊舊艦兩艘、今已調回、另以新艦兩艘孟却斯德號與利物浦號代之、又有枚洛塞斯特號、現亦開往東印度、以代替旗艦諾福克號、英國因爲華盛頓海軍條的所限制、未能將駐華艦隊恢復歐戰前力量、但新造軍艦、現陸續吿成、故將逐漸調換舊艦、以增進英國在遠東方面海軍地位、據專家意見、萬一事變發生、現駛往遠東之新巡艦五艘、可以聯合而成力量相同之艦隊、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據今日外交觀察家稱，由羅斯福突召美艦返太平洋一事、足以明暸、國際現勢及世界大戰之遠近、據聞此决命令乃由羅斯福總統個人所決定、各艦將領事前均無所知、非正式方面幾均以爲此舉乃對付日本之策略、或英美兩國有默契之表示、（十九日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日工黨議員漢德森在下院中質問稱、政府是吾已決定需要中國及其他遠東國家加入反侵略大同盟、張伯倫答稱、英國甚願考慮此項問題云、（十九日美聯電）</p>
<p>（輪渡）據聞、星期二英國外相哈利法克斯勛爵與中國駐英大使郭泰祺博士在外交部談話之時、曾初次提及將反侵略陣綫擴展至遠東之事、今日勞工黨員漢特遜將在下議院中向張伯倫稱、『政府曾吾決定使中國或遠東其他國家參加反侵略陣綫、』漢特遜吿美聯社記者稱、反共軸心旣有一端在東亞、是則新集體安全制亦必須包括東方及歐洲始能生效、吾意非欲擯日本於此陣綫之外、亦無包圍日本之意、日本如能採取不侵略政策、則余歡迎日本參加、美聯社記者所訪問之外交家均以爲、倘目下英法與蘇聯之談判、爲建立反傻略陣綫之第二階段、則中國及亞洲其他國家之加入反侵略陣錢爲第三階段、惟美艦駛返太平洋一事、此間人士均以爲乃一種的束東半球侵略行動之表示、即此間之華方人士、亦僅希望、目下英國予中國以進一步之財政援助、並减少或阻止英國對日貿易、（十八日美聯電）</p>

<p>羅斯福召見　財政專家會議</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統昨日曾與政府中財政專家、如財政部長摩根韜等會商、討論當此歐洲戰爭威脅下、應如何保護美國財政及其經濟機構種種事宜、召集此一會議之原因、乃以過去四週以來、自歐洲流入美國之黃金、估計的在五〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元左右、突使美國財政部所儲黃金、達一五·五〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、或佔世界金量百分之六十、政府方面、不僅對於黃金集中美國一事、表示應予處置、而總統亦企圖當此歐洲情勢緊張之際、設法保護美國證劵及國外滙兌市塲、按今日與總統會商者、計有財政部長摩根韜·農業部長華萊士·聯邦儲備局主任艾克勒士·證劵交易委員漢勒斯及福蘭克二人、（十九日美聯電）</p>
<p>羅斯福壯舉</p>
<p>英極感動</p>
<p>內閣討論國防</p>
<p>（倫敦）路透社下院訪員稱、今日首相張伯倫在下院言及羅斯福總统時、全塲歡呼不已、足見下院議員對於美總統呼籲和平之電文、莫不滿意、議員偶有向首相發出關於英美合作以謀歐洲和平之問話者、皆愼重措詞、至對於美國政策頗加以顧慮、今日各議員詳論美總統之舉動、皆較前興奮、一般意見皆認美總統表示其膽量、適得其時、可見美總統之舉動、已在英國國會方面發生鎭定效力、各方面無不稱頌美總統之行爲、但未有對於美總統此舉之結果懷抱奢望者（十八日路透）</p>
<p>（倫敦）路透社國會訪員探悉、英國實行徵兵制問題、爲重要國防之一、今日內閣舉行週會時、或將考慮及此、此外尙有須考慮者、爲（一）軍需部之創立、與部長之選擇、（二）國民服務方面保留任務之核减、藉以鼓勵國防志願軍之招募、（三）全國靑年非軍事性質的體育之强迫實施、據路透社訪員云、徵兵制在英國現猶視爲不致實現、惟國內外對于此制需要性之意見、刻正在甚審愼研究中、陸相培利夏昨與首相張伯倫晤談良久、聞培利夏甚贊成設立軍需部、或同樣機關、俾襄助國防、而供應英國擴大軍隊所必需之配備、現國防志願軍人數擴增一倍、故此問題愈形尖銳云（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）內閣本日午前舉行會議時、聞已決定設立軍需部、該部大臣人選、計有蘭凱斯特郡事務大臣莫理遜、與航空部前任顧問韋爾勛爵二人、但尙未加以確定（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美巡洋艦　訪瑪爾泰島　德一部分艦隊出發　往西班牙海面會操</h3>
<p>瑪爾泰　今日此間發表、美國巡洋艦「阿瑪哈」號、擬於四月二十五日至五月二日間訪問瑪爾泰島、海軍官員不願評論美艦訪問英海軍根據地之重要性、觀察家指稱、該美艦訪問瑪爾泰島之日期、適與德國國會舉行會議之日期（四月二十八日）不的而同、殊堪重視、按希特勒氏將於四月二十八日在國會發表演說、答復羅斯福氏之和平呼籲（十九日美聯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國軍艦二十五艛及輔助艦若干艘、將在西班牙海岸舉行會操、今日已開始在希里哥倫之外集中、戰艦與潛艇、係於夜間駛離基爾軍港、餘者今晨由威廉哈文出發、據官塲宣布、德艦出游、將歷一月之久、會操地點在西班牙西面大西洋中、據今日非官塲消息、德艦隊將以義國海港爲最後目的地、聞四月二十八日前後、將游葡京、德國官塲所定四月二十七日起至五月十九日止之艦隊游程、有西班牙口岸七處及菲洲休逢、丹吉爾、與葡京三處、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德艦四十艛，內有二十八艘係戰鬥艦艇、已於昨日開往西班牙、葡萄牙、西屬摩洛哥海面、德政府於海軍出發時、更發表公吿，聲明此舉並無軍事意義、但事實上軍事意義極大、蓋德國海軍開出後、可與義國地中海艦隊會合故也、按英法兩國現在地中海之艦隊、雖以大型艦居勝、但小型艦則不如德義之聯合艦隊、雙方在地中海一帶之勢力如是、可作如下之對比、英艦現集中於馬爾太、法艦則集中於直布羅陀、同時在地中海入口處丹吉爾海口方面有英法聯合艦隊一百五十艘巡邏、以防萬一之變（十九日美聯社電）</p>
<p>丹吉爾　今日有大隊摩洛哥新軍自西班牙之加迪滋·阿達貢·與阿爾吉雪拉斯、抵達西屬摩洛哥之秀太與米爾美拉二地、因此更增此間人士之恐慌、據觀察家之計算、目下共有摩洛哥軍隊六萬人、集中於西屬摩洛哥、至平時該處僅有軍隊約三萬人，又回敎徒循例將於五月一日及三日舉行「回敎節」、此間深懼不肯份子將乘機搗亂、作爲全能國家採取干涉行動之藉口云、又據報、丹吉爾國際區邊境之勃格太附近已有摩洛哥軍隊發現、按該處並未設防、係丹吉爾與脫杜間公路之要衝、（十八日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦)西班牙駐國際中立地丹吉爾港高級委員曾向英國領事切實提供保證、聲明西國絕無威脅該港之意、亦無調動軍隊軍艦情事、外間謠傳西國擬向該港進攻、實出虛搆、此外、葡萄牙國政府、聞亦通知英國政府稱、葡西兩國交界處所、並無義國軍隊調動情事、外傳葡國有遭受攻擊之虞、實屬毫無根據、此間消息靈通人士頃宣稱、英國海軍部當局對於地中海西部局勢、已不若前此之悲觀、德國艦隊開往西班牙海游弋之舉、亦不足以造成嚴重之威脅云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>南非溫賀克　行政委員會委員泰爾迦德今日向路透訪員述及昨日遣派警備隊增援西南非事、謂西南非居有德人八千、大半置有武器、會經組織、在目前之大局中、恐將有不顧責任之舉動、雖此種起事、或企圖搗亂、終必失敗、然必因此喪失生命、並釀重大之損害、無論如何、以防患未然、較爲得計云、昨由的翰尼斯堡與白洛姆方坦開出增援西南非之警備隊、明日可抵此間、同時西南非各站之警察、現正集中此間當局已忽遽爲備駐所、按溫賀克爲西南非之省會、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>開浦鎮　南非著名政治家斯末資將軍、今日在錢會中、提出非洲西南部警察併入南非警察之議案時宣稱、「奧地利之被兼併、係藉口其未能維持法律與秩序、惟對於南非聯邦政府、則不致作此語、政府統治委任代管地之責任、一日未卸、仍將繼續執行其職責、鑒於政府上星期內所接到各方面消息之嚴重性、公衆之輿情、或將認派往該代管地之兵力爲不足、惟望所採取之步驟、將可獲得所預期之效果、該地之各界、將不致發生仟何妨害良好秩序之運動云、斯氏又指出非洲西南部之警力、極爲有限、祇有二百四十名警察、散布全境並有集中警察於有發生擾亂可能各地之必要、斯氏末稱、警察之調動、並無軍事上之重要意義云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>郭大使演講</p>
<p>中國抗戰</p>
<p>（倫敦）中國大使郭泰祺頃在北美俱樂部宴會席决發表演說、略謂、關於亞洲事件、美國總統羅斯福所發表之言論、其堅決處實與談及歐洲問題時相等、殊堪欣慰、至以中日戰事而論、中國實爲國際正義而戰亦即爲世界各國民治制而戰、中國之支待戰事、幾全憑本身之力、爲時已二十一閱月於茲、不僅爲本國而戰、抑　迫使侵略陣錢在亞洲方面之夥伴、陷於吾國之泥淖中、此於全世界各民治國、均屬有利云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本報紙　分獲羅斯福靑睞　請將致以德義巨頭同樣電　日外務省認爲係揣測之辭</h3>
<p>（東京）朝日新出載稱、美總統羅期福擬以本人名義、以與致希特勒信墨索里尼電文類同之電、致日政府、羅總統或將宣布、美國願積極斡旋召開遠東關係各國會議、以覓取東亞現局之解決方法、但須待日本贊同後始宣布之、該報復預料、羅總統將於載日本前駐美大使齋藤屍灰來日之美艦亞斯多里亞號駛離横濱後、致送此電、該報又稱、日當局業已討論日本之復文、日本將（一）贊同德義對美覆文、預料此兩覆文之性質、將拒絕羅總統之呼籲、（二）維持遠東會議非爲處理大局之有效適當辦法之立塲、日本將拒不贊同召開此種會議云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外務省發言人今日宣稱、朝日新聞所載、羅斯福總統似有以個人名義之電文、送達日本之說、純屬揣測云、（十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>靑年應有良好德性　及健康的性機能</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>在靑年高尙之欲望中，莫大於養成完全人格，以担負將來社會之重任，在成年之責任中，亦莫耍於善用其天賦之才能，敎育之所薰陶，以肩荷社會之巨艱，所惜者，今世之多數靑年，雖具有良好之意志，正確之慾望，終以德性薄弱，心地草率，復以缺乏性知識，遂無形屈降於惡劣之試誘，染不良之惡習，縱慾摧殘，於不數年後，身體精神，雙方破產，甚至因罹疾病，無顏自存，此縱慾之所以爲害也。</p>
<p>在靑年想像中，咸認爲人身中一種最神秘而有勢力之衝動，對異性則顯有不可壓抑之愛力，即其身體心靈整個，亦常受其驅使，際此情竇初開，理性未全時，往往有不良友伴，將其一己之性經騐，廣爲曲解，有時且强其作摹倣式之實騐，實騐結果，惟有自羞自慚，因此有若干靑年，往往痛恨前非，潔身自愛，抱定決心，打破試誘，將來仍不失爲有用之人，然又有多數靑年，一誤再誤，雖明知其非，却仍與不良之友朋往還，常因一時之邪念，甘作性慾之放恣；早洩陰萎，婚後之生活遂陷於痛苦之中。</p>
<p>靑年因自暴自棄，致染上自凟，或荒淫墮落，而爆發性機能與腦神經衰弱症者，不勝枚舉，關於此種疾病在余多年治療之臨床經騐所知，最有效之療法，厥爲性腺內分泌療法，息者可購服德國出品之眞正猩猩睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」日服三次，確有補腦補腎，補血之效，良由該劑合動牧之睪丸精質甚富，並滲入補腦之燐質，與促進新陳代謝之番木鼇等，故效果得勝市上之同樣製劑可達五倍至廿五倍之譜。惟在治療時應戒絕手淫，有遺精者，可服「耐而斯遺精片」以止之。而女子之婚後不妊，月經不調，乳編失健者，服以女用「補體康」即得回春效果，此余在臨床實騐上已我言证明，蓋市上之同樣制劑，佳者不多，且戟刺腸胃副作用甚大，惟「補體康」確有名符其實之效，常服之確有返老還童之妙。</p>
<h3>自凟與遺精的治愈</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學　博士鄭霆</p>
<p>患者馬文杰，年二十一歲，常州人，服務於某工塲，性好酒色，於十七歲時，受劣友之誘惑，而以自凟遂情，久而成習，每夜至少自凟二三度，精血之消耗，不可勝計，如是一年有餘，忽有遺精發現，而自凟猶不能戒絕，此時雖曾服以市上之固精片，可說一無效果，而於白晝間亦有見色流精之象，繼而腦弱耳鳴，健忘失眠等衰弱症象，隨之蜂起。始來余處治療，余乃令其戒絕自凟惡習，並嚴守攝生，忌食煙酒等刺激品，每日電療十五分鐘，並令服「耐而斯遺精片」以鞏固精關，並治遺精，再兼服以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以培補虧損，治療由自凟遺精所引起的種種衰弱症象。馬君遵余言而行，本及一月，遺精滑精已無，二個月後，腦弱健忘，耳鳴失眠等衰弱症象全無，三個月後，諸症全消，而體重增加，面色紅潤，已恢復固有之健康矣。</p>

<h3>淋病並非無藥醫</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師講</p>
<p>凡是一種病患，苟非絕症，終是有藥可治，不過此藥是吾與病相符而已，治淋亦猶是也。夫淋菌一物，固極頑强，但並非無藥醫之病，惟因此菌善於四散奔竄，一般局部之化學療法，透膜殺菌療法，萬難奏效。此爲余從前在美利堅攻讀醫科時於臨床上即已證明，但如能服用一種使體內發生一種抗淋毒素，使其發揮全部圍剿淋菌之威力，將所有淋菌徹底解決，則凡一切淋病，如遠年白濁或新起白濁，及其他變症等，亦可指揮如意而徹底治愈是安可謂淋病無藥醫乎。</p>
<p>「克淋儂」一藥，是德國彼德博士所發明，而會經世界各國所實地試騐分析，證明其有特效者，因「克淋儂」係採用黃色素及蛋白體混合製成，服後於數分鐘內每個細胞，均能自動發揮抗淋殺菌作用，但此作用，並不妨礙健全部分之生理機能，與一般副作用强大之劣藥，不可同日而語也。良由「克淋儂」之撲減淋菌，係直接發生於病灶，此允爲任何淋病內服藥中所不能幾及者。宜乎歐美醫家，一致推用此劑而熱烈贊美。據最近德國花柳病院淋病科主任，芬克Fink博士云，在近十年「克淋儂」治愈淋病患者，何止千萬，其成績之超越，確非一般淋病內服藥所能望其項背，凡淋毒性攝護頒炎，前後尿道炎睪丸炎，膀統炎，及婦女淋毒白帶等，服一克淋儂」均有意外之特效。在外用藥方面，女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，一方內服「克淋儂」。在男子可外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明書在家自行治療，如此須經過短期中，即可全部治愈，說淋病無綫　者，實屬欺人之妄說，不足置信。</p>
<h3>肺病与咯血</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺病之咯血，由於病變都分血管脆弱，因了運動和咳嗽等關係，而實使脈管破裂而成咯血症狀，結核病本爲慢性病，一切病的變化，其經過均極瓀緩，惟咯血一症，爲其實發之事，故須作有效之處置，是絕對不可疎忽的。惟在學理上及經騐上，咯血並非絕對危篤之症，但亦不能視爲輕微症狀，依余廿餘年之經騐，「補肺空爾」一藥，能增加病者本身的抵抗力，而緊縮病灶，使病菌因包圍錮禁而至自斃，故不僅能將咯血治癒，即咯血之根源，亦可根治，余謂肺病咯血之並不可畏者，其原故即在於此。</p>
<p>淋病瑣探</p>
<h3>白濁失姙非妻之罪</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>在社會上男女兩性尙未完全立於平等地位之今日，往往將無子之責任，卸之於對方之女性，即如男性患淋毒性攝護腺炎而成不孕者，亦歸咎於女方，此質頻倒事實之判斷也。蓋囚計多淋病，往往因患者處置失宜，或行不合理之尿道內注射，致將淋菌山尿道誘入攝護腺管，更從此總管竄入数十条之腺體，於是淋菌即在各處繁殖子孫，分泌毒汁，攝詠腺因受此淋菌毒溺刺戟而發炎，是爲攝護腺炎，不過初起時，僅在鄰接尿道部分之攝護腺發炎，司不致受淋毒的蹂躪，而保持其分泌液，助精子活動的能力。此囚患者放棄不治，或冶療而不得其法，則淋菌漸决分布於攝護腺之各部，使整個之攝護之排泄管完全失去效能而至淤塞，攝護腺之分泌作用旣完全停止，則妻子自無受姙之可能。余對此症，遇之甚夥。有李姓，係一中年男子，彼於廿六歲時曾染淋病，後雖治療終未斷根。自後其妻即未有姙，反疑其妻子不育，後經余治療，知其已患攝護腺炎，乃爲之使用德國靜電療法，並投以「克淋儂」，的五星期而淋菌完全肅淸，上月其友人王君因性神經衰弱乞余治療，謂李君在余處治療後，其妻即已成孕，近將分娩云　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角。</p>

<h3>總董樊克令之演詞</h3>
<p>總董樊克令氏之演詞、摘要如下、鄙人忝任工部局總董、又將一年期滿、職責所在、自應提出議案第六項、而請諸君將截至一九三八年十二月三十一日為止之本局報告及賬目、核准通過、納稅人之此决年會、表示本局之另一市政年度、已在艱奮之中、又告終了、在已往之一年間、本局會遭遇種種問題、此等問題、含有非常困難而複雜之性質、其所牽涉之事項、有難民救濟·糧食燃料管理·外灘碼頭設備·西區住宅區域內開設工廠·收回虹口管理權·以及取締恐怖事件等等、至於各種賡續發生之問題、無時非本局所須注意者、更無待贅述、今日鄙人不欲將所有事項、逐一叙述、關於此等事項、大都在本局之一九一三八年份年報中、已有詳細說明、凡關心本局行政狀况之公衆、可請注意上項年報、鄙人所擬陳述者、當在可能範圍以內、限於若干事項可認爲特别重要或需更詳細之解釋、或說明者、有若干事件深爲一般公衆所關切、第因格於公共租界之特殊國際性與國際關係、未便在會塲自由討論、</p>
<p>恐怖事件</p>
<p>恐怖事件爲近来民衆頗堪注意之一項問題、以用暗殺手段爲政治上之武器者、不僅於中國有之、在今日所謂文明世界之紊亂情形之下、政治性之暗殺案、常於各國發生、此種罪行、爲秘密行動所造成、自非定可預防或遏止、就吾人之經騐而論、任何國家縱使設有曾受最高等訓練而最有效率之警務機關、亦無法撲滅此種罪案、固無疑義、在已往之一年或一年餘間、發生於公共租界以內之政治性暗殺案、件數較多、此等罪案、不僅限於一團體或一黨派、內有若干起、顯示一種回復至中古時代之心理之趨勢、此種趨勢、在現代之情况下、誠足使人震驚、</p>
<p>本局之警務人員、已有繁劇之工作、然有一部份人士、謂其在此非常時期、無力完全預防政治性犯罪行爲之發生、此種苛刻之批評、鄙人認爲不當、本局警務人員執行職務時所處之環境、爲世界上所絕無僅有、若輩所服務之區域、曾受戰禍、日有因戰事而造成之深仇、暗中醞釀、此區域中人口甚爲繁密、而無數之狹仄街道里衖、復可縱橫通達、於是自然成爲兇犯匪徒之淵藪况各方面之人民、均因其地勢與環境易於入境、此等事實、不容忽視、日本當道感覺此項問題之跋重性與困難、已表示廳與本局警務人員合作、以遏止恐怖事件、本局一方面不承認本局警務人員可受任何束縛、一方面以最友誼之精神、允與日方合作、但有一條件、即任何合作之辦法、必須得本局警務處長之同意、並與其商定後、始可實行、換言之、凡公共租界內實際上非由軍隊管領之區域中專屬於公共租界警務人員之警權、應予保存、不屬於公共租界警務處之機關、不得在各該區域內行使警權、各該區域內行使驚權、</p>
<p>職員薪津</p>
<p>本局職員之薪津問題、亦嘗為公衆所注意、引起不少評論、上年間、中國法幣滙價之跌落、以及戰後之情形、使租界內之生活程度高漲、因此本局曾將職員之薪俸表隨時覆核、旋於六月及七月間、准以生活費特別津貼發給等級較低之中外籍職員、洎乎上年年底、生活程度、仍見昇高、以致本局不得不將薪津問題、更行通盤籌、且本局所給職員之薪俸、如折合外幣計算數額頗低、使本局招聘專門人才之困難、益感增重、同時本局又聞若干高級專門人員、亦因此有辭職之意、本局銓叙委員會考慮此項問題以後、議決增加低級職員生活費津貼、並准A級職員按其薪俸之三分之一領受全部滙兌津貼、此種辦法、業經本局董事會批准、本局又爲易於延攬合同之職員及防止專門人員辭職起見、通過議案一項、准提高高級職員的二十人之待遇、外界對於此事、頗有誤會鄙人茲欲聲明者、本局提高各該高級職員之待遇、並非爲彌補其生活費用、本局之用意、在使至少若干人員所領之薪俸、能與在上海及其他各處辦事而有同等能力、並負同等責仟之人員所領之數額相埒、以便現在供職及將來所擬延聘之人員、得以安心服務、凡已研究此項間題而知悉世界上其他各大城市中之公務人員所領薪俸數額之納稅人、當可承認現在本局高級職員之牧入、尙比在其他各處服務之同級職員所入較少、本局之議決案發表以後、公衆紛紛批評、本局爲儘發聽取納稅人方面之意見起見、乃聘請商界份子、組織一委員會、請其覆核本局之議決案、並發表其意見、旋山該委員提出報告及建議、該委員會對於本局所定發給最低級職員津貼之辦法、表示同意、但對於本局所定優待最高級職員之辦法、未予贊同、共建議爲所有A級職員應於本局所已准給之滙兌津貼以外、領受一種生活費津貼、此項建議、經本局採納、本局减少高級職員薪津、照章應於六個月以前通知、但各該職員自願放棄權利、因此該特別委員會之建議、得以立時實行、納稅人所應注意者、即該委員會對於本局所定基木薪俸表、是吾適當、未曾置詞、現在適用之薪俸表、係以職員經濟委員會之建議爲根據、當該委員開會時、滙價有於長時期內穩定之希望、薪俸數額、乃根據此項事實及當時之情形而定、任何薪俸表不能在一切情形之下、均可適用、允其於滙價及一般狀况發生劇烈變化時爲然、依據地產章程、納稅人及木局各有專責、木局方面、負有任用職員並決定其薪俸數額之責、關於此事、有須記憶者一層即公共租界之市政、含有國際性質、木局應維持辦理市政之標準程度、而納稅人方面、當知本局有時有改訂一部份薪作表之必耍、本局因職員死亡辭職或被黜、須聘有辦事能力之新職員、以資抵補、此類職員、倘屬可能當就地延用、吾則須聘自國外、屆時本局所允給之薪俸數額、如與現在所定者相同、或無法覓得滿意之人才、本局遇有此等情事發生之時、除非中國法幣之價値、有目前未可逆料之昇漲、或須考慮如何提高基本薪俸之數額、</p>
<p>本年內有本局最高級職員二人退休、一爲本局總裁費信惇君、一爲本局財務處長福特君、</p>
<p>總裁退休</p>
<p>費信惇君於一九三〇年當選爲本局董事、連任至一九二九年、在一九二三年與一九二九年之間、任木局總董、自一九二九年起、任總裁之職、一九二五年與一九二七年兩年、本局適逢多事之秋、幸有費君領導同僚、方克安渡、費君仟總裁時之工作、當然有一種機密性質、未能爲納稅人所深悉、但與其接近之同僚、均知共貢獻至有價値、歷任總董、無不倚畀費君、向其諮詢意見、費君處事鎭靜識見宏遠熟悉上海歷史、且於法學、造詣頗深、因此其服務之價値、殊爲重大、本局同人、深表敬重、本年費君行將告退、不勝遺憾幸費君不擬遠離上海、仍可隨時指敎、殊堪欣慰、</p>
<p>財長退休</p>
<p>本局財務處長福特君、亦將於本年董事會休會以前退職、查福君自一九二四年起任代理財務處長之職、一九二八年、眞除財務處長、本局財務處之責任、在福君任期內、日見增重、一九二八年、本局經常特別兩門之收支預算、共開三千八百萬元、而本年之預算、共開八千二百五十萬餘元、本局總辦處之捐稅股、自一九三二年起、改隸於財務處、因此福君之職實、更爲艱鉅、本局會於福君任期內、與若干公用事業公司、訂立極重要之協定、關於此等協定之談判、均有福君參與其事、福君於一九〇八年入木局供職、是年本局之經常收入的三百萬兀、資產的値一千二百萬元、今年本局之經常收入的二千八百萬元、資產的値一萬七千萬元、公共租界之財政信用卓著、此應向福君表示感激者也、福君本可於一九三六年退職、嗣因本局挽留、繼續任職至今、</p>
<p>上年賬目</p>
<p>上年度之張目、已於財務處長之報告寶內、詳細開明、試觀決算、諸君可知是年之虧空數額、比預算之虧空、减少七十八萬二千餘元、其主要原因、在下半年所收捐稅、爲數大見增加、捐稅增加之原因、一則在西區工業之發展、二則在蘇州河以南之空屋减少、然同時因中國法幣價値之降落、使本局之支出方面、增加頗多、允以養老金·退職金·等類支出爲然、加以本局給與職員之生活費津貼、爲原預算所未列、至於本局各處之設施、均受相當限制、若干工作、因鑒於環境不良、暫經擱置因此開支較省、至於工務之各種措施、允爲顯著、惟衛生處之支出、超出預算、直接為救濟難民而支出之費用、有一部份已與自娛樂捐內提用之款相抵銷、至各項特別開支、亦受限制，所舉辦之公共工程、僅以切要者爲限、但因非常狀態、繼續存在、本局之緊急費用、超出預算不少、本局之投資銀行、自上年初起吸收定期存款、此種短期周轉辦法之成績、已列表載明於年報內矣、</p>
<p>本年賬目</p>
<p>一九三九年度之預算案、業於日前分送諸君閱覽、該預算附有詳細之說明書、故鄙人僅須提出數點、請諸君注意、本年三月八日、本局董事會開會討論如何平衡本年度之通常預算、依照財務處長所開預算、本局如照現行捐率收捐、則虧空的國幣三百萬元、各項開支、已在似屬可行之範國內儘是减縮、至於收入方面、則以合乎情理之樂觀眼光估計之、所預算之支出總額、比上年度約增五百七十萬元、其激增之原因、殆完全由於國幣之跌價、本局逆料空屋之减少、工業之發展、以及各公用事業公司應付特許費之增多、固可使收入增加、但二者相抵、仍感不敷、爲平衡此項預算起見、財務處長擬請本局自本年七月一日起、將普通房捐暨界外區域特別房損捐率各增百分之二、並有同日起、將地稅按照同樣比例增加之、其餘不敷之數、的一百七十五元、可</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>與前兩年之虧空用同樣方法彌補之、該處長之建議、經財務委員會審核認可、本局倘能維持信用、並使各種主要市政工作照常進行、本不願於此時加捐、然而董事會慎重考慮此項問題之各方面關係以後、認爲加捐一舉、勢須於本年內實行、惟爲提早預先通知納稅人、以便納稅人準備起見、議決將開始加捐日期改爲本年十月爲期、照現在所擬辦法、本年內向納稅人加徵之捐稅、约等於納稅人上年所付實數之百分之三、如以全年計算、比上年约增百分之十二叉二分之一、本埠九個月來、物品及公用事業所漲之價、不祇此數、茲以自十月一日起加捐以後之收入計算、預算中尙虧短约二百三十萬元、須設法籌備、本局擬即援照前兩年之先例、自準備金內提用此數、俾得平衡預算、至提用之數、當以將來預算中之盈餘撥還、或用其他籌款方法彌補、茲應請諸君注意者、即本局所可處分之準備金、並非用之不罄、事實上此項準備金、爲數頗屬有限、因此如有人有將準備金動用殆盡之任何意見、非鄙人所敢贊同、本年度之敎育經費、共計二百三十五萬四千元、比上年增加三十五萬一千二百四十元、此數約等於本局所收房捐地稅之七分之一、關於特別預算、有可向諸君聲明者一層、即本局之建設計劃、業經縮小至最低限度、辦理各種緊急事務、與償付公債之支出、以及彌補本年度虧空所需之數目、均經列入此項預算、茲擬請諸君准許本局籌集款項至多一千二百萬元、此款或無法全數籌足　第所用籌款方法、當由下屆董事會考量也、</p>
<h3>外僑納稅會　會塲難寫</h3>
<p>一年一度的外僑納稅會，年會於昨天下午二時半假大光明影戲院舉行，到會的納稅西人，分坐於樓上下席次，計達一千餘人，西裝革履，少長咸集。大門外懸有西僑納稅人會之西文白布横額。開會前，中西探捕畢集，對入塲人仕，分別指告席次，異常周到。主席臺下左首設華文報記者席七席，右首爲西文報記者席。主席臺席次H形，中間爲主席莫少圃氏席次，左右爲工部局董事席，日本籍董事岡本及杉坂，則坐於主席臺之右側。昨日工部局董事愷自威君，衣大禮服到塲，儀態莊肅，頗爲全塲人士所注目。全塲衣中裝參加者，僅有旁廳之華籍新聲社記者朱圭林君及本報記者兩人，可謂無獨有偶矣。至西籍記者到者不少，並有西籍女記者一人，亦臨時坐於華文報記者席。會塲中備有播音器，聲浪異常淸晰。昨日大會發言最多者，爲工部局總董樊克令氏，渠報告工部局行政情形，達一小時半之久，聽衆屛息無聲，十分注視。報告畢，羣衆報以熱烈之掌聲。當討論各項議案時，出席人司蒂瓦脫Stewart氏陳述對於增加工部局預算案，表示其個人意見，未能盡同，並以兩紙書明其意見，貼於其席次臺旁，渠叙述意見時，一面斟茶，一面陳詞，態度頗爲灑脫；但該案結果，經衆討論，未獲成立。</p>
<h3>法租界昨日發生　干涉縣旗事件　經交涉後發還國旗　被捕諸人已允釋放</h3>
<p>昨日爲國民精神總動員宜傳週之農工商界宣傳日、全市各界除電呈蔣委員長致敬慰勞、並祝最後勝利外、昨晨七時起、所有公共租界·法租界·各大商店各住戶、並均一律自動升懸國旗、藉以作市民奉行國民精神總動員之具體表示、情緒異常熱烈、詎法租界當局、竟干涉界內各商店懸旗，昨晨九時起、法捕房即派出大批探捕分赴各馬路向各商店勸告，卸下國旗、但法大馬路一帶商店、以事關國體主權、均表抗議、不允卸下、詎當時俄越捕等、竟强將各店所懸之旗自行收下、但各商店待越捕等離去後、重又懸掛、結果探捕竟勒迫各店交出國旗、帶回捕房、但各商店激於熱忱、仍多添購新旗、再行升懸、其百折不撓之精神、實充分表現國民愛國情緒之熱况、</p>
<p>引起糾紛商店停市</p>
<p>但法捕房方面仍派大批探捕繼續進行干涉、西新橋大光明內衣店之學徒一名、因與越捕爭執、致遭毆擊、且將該店主拘去、其他如泰康食品公司·冠生園·王大有·中滙内衣公司·鶴鳴鞋帽商店·上海帽店·洪大蓆號·同盛米號·美亞鐘錶店·五和織造廠·安大襪廠·天香齋糕糰舖等、均被强將國旗取去、又西門路和記食物號、被巡捕擊毀玻璃店門、先後被拘者约四十人於是各店乃一律自動停市、造至昨晚發槁時止、所有八仙橋東、鄧家木橋以西各商店、均一律相繼停市、黃金大戲院昨晚並退號票、暫時停演、表示決心、霞飛路上、亦有南洋西服店等數家停市、</p>
<p>派員交涉結果圓滿</p>
<p>自上項事件發生後、本埠各團體聞訊、深爲扼腕、除派員慰問各被干涉之商店及住戶外、並推派代表向法當局接洽、聞法當局已允將被捕人員、完全釋放、所有被取去國旗、亦全部發還、茲將本市各界國民精神總動員協會總部之難勉同胞書照錄如次、全市同胞公鑒、昨（十九）日爲國民精神總動員宣傳週農工商界宣傳日、本市各界民衆、一致懸旗、情况熱烈、至堪嘉慰、不料法租界當局、竟予干涉、且逮捕民衆、沒收國旗、此種不友好之行爲、深爲扼腕、而我同胞雖妄被干涉、但英勇不屈之精神、爲中外人仕所身玲目擊、此種貞固不移之態度、即爲本市民衆精神總動員之具體表現、現本市各民衆團體、已急電外交部請向法國駐華大使嚴重交涉、以中法邦交之敦睦、此事當可得圓滿之結果、願吾同胞聽候政府之解決、共維社會之秩序、幸甚、幸甚、上海市各界國民精神總動員協會總部、</p>
<p>法租界當局之佈告</p>
<p>法租界當局、爲懸旗糾紛事、特發出如下之佈告、「爲佈告事、照得本租界內、任何政府示威運動、懸爲厲禁、此種示威運動、顯爲利在肇事、以擾害公共秩序與安全之搗亂份子所鼓動、本當局一面尊重各個意思、一面有採取必要步驟、以維租界絕對中立及居民安寗之責任、如有必要、自當驅逐搗亂份子、關於集體懸旗、除國慶日外、凡含有政治示威性質者、尤在禁止之例、合特重行申告仰居民八等一體知悉、切切、比佈、」</p>
<p>武裝巡邏情勢嚴重</p>
<p>自法大馬路各商店相繼停市後、法捕房方面深恐釀成事變、故除立派大批俄越推分駐各馬路要口戒備外、同時鐵甲、爽快車、裝甲車等、亦多出運巡邏、對羣眾聚焦之所、加以彈壓、並檢查行人、一時情勢甚為嚴重、而尤以黃金大戲院門首一帶爲甚、</p>
<h3>精神衝動員會　朂勉全市靑年　以四大要點相策勵　共負救國建國責任　今日為教育界宣傳日</h3>
<p>今日爲國民精神總動員敎育界宣傳日、全市各畢校除舉行國民精神總動員綱領之大單元敎學、各報出版特刊外、並由敎界國民精神總動員協會發表告全市靑年書、茲摘錄如次、　　靑年是時代的驕子、有質樸的心性、聰敏的腦筋、活潑的精神、强健的體魄、和光榮的革命歷史、在中國、無論是政治·文化·以及科學、沒有一事不是由靑年來提倡、來推動、來變革、而至於逐漸達到目的、五四運動時、我國靑年對於政治和文化的啟蒙、固然立下了燦爛的功績、即黃花崗七十二烈士中、所機牲的大多數是靑年、其後五卅運動、九一八和一二八事變、無一次沒有靑年學生、在救國大潮流中、呼號活躍、華北局勢緊張中、以迄蘆溝橋抗戰砲聲響澈後、靑年的動態、尤其値得令人興奮鼓舞、從前方以及後方、從正規戰以及游擊戰、差不多有數十萬的靑年、餐風沐雨、忍飢耐寒、奔馳苦幹、犧牲救國、在民族革命史上、的確是値得大書特書的、可是我們孤島上的靑年怎樣呢、勤勞刻苦爲國奮鬥的、固然有、但百分之八十以上的靑年、仍舊度其醉生夢死的生活、保其苟且偷生的習性、暮氣充溢、不求知也不求行、舉凡奮發蓬勃的朝氣、勇敢前進的決心、節约廉介的風尙、忠義知恥的道德、在孤島上已如晨星之寥落、孤島雖有百餘萬靑年、其實大多數都是坐等亡國、或是坐等勝利之降臨、而甘心放棄大革命時期救國建國的神聖使命、縱或淸夜捫心、不能自愧、恐怕後世、也必然要加以唾罵也、現在我們所希望於全市靑年的、有下列數點、</p>
<p>集體奮鬥　社會越進化、則人們的工作、越趨集團、也只有集體工作、纔能產生鉅大的力量、救國建國、尤其非使全國民衆、都有組織、都能在集團中動員不可、國民精神總動員、就是要以這種集團的精神和力量、來帮助軍隊抗敵、帮助政府建國、使最後勝利、復與民族、迅速完成、所以靑年們非但要自已放棄個人主義的活動、踴躍地參加這個集團、同時、還要自動地組織這個集團、或宣傳並推動他人來參加這個集團</p>
<p>信仰統一　中國抗戰不是僅做到獲得國家的獨立自由爲止、乃是要使民挨主義民權主義民生主義、都能同時並進、具體實行、我們既是要建設一個自由幸福的三民主義新中國、那末、必然要共同信仰三民主義、硏究三民主義、宣傳三民主義、為三民主義而奮鬥救國、並且有了共同信仰之後、就一定能夠由共信而互信、使民族統一戰綫、團結得如塞門汀一樣的堅强、以此除敵、何敵不摧、以此建國、何患不達目的、</p>
<p>意志集中　在抗戰期間、有了共同信仰以後、還要有共同的意志、不紛歧、不錯亂、向著共同目標前進、使敵人由削弱而動搖、由動搖而崩潰、所調共同目標、就是無論何種工作、也是無論體何種事業、都要不憚煩勞、精細設計、使有助於抗戰、有益於國家民族、換言之、就是時時刻刻、要把「國家至上、民族至上、國事第一、勝利第一、」放在心上、作為一切工作事業的前提、</p>
<p>生活改革　除上述以外、個人的習性與生活、也和抗戰建國、有莫大的影響、經濟上和時間上的浪費、固然會削弱抗戰的經濟、延遲勝利的時間、就是萎靡不振、苟且偷安、庸懦浪漫、也足以亡國而有餘、何况前方戰士、正爲民族犧牲、無數同胞、也爲國家受苦、我們獨何心而享樂、至於在校求學之靑年、尤其應該刻苦精動、朝氣奮發、做一般靑年的模範、爲抗戰而工作、爲建國而求知、從今日起、我們要共同負起救國建國的責任、使經濟和時間、都能向著革命的大路前進、</p>
<h3>日方限制　外僑往來滬漢　大批伯人困守望半載始得來滬　其他旅漢外僑甚多無法成行</h3>

<h3>馮炳南氏談　兩廣難胞之救濟　已得有捐款十七萬元　將於四月底作一結束</h3>
<p>廣東旅滬同鄉救濟兩廣難民募捐委員會、自本年一月十五日舉行募捐委員會成立大會、迄今甫及三月、捐款已達十七萬餘元、成績頗有可觀、新聲通訊社記者聞兩粵災情重大、甚爲關切、又悉該會委員長馮炳南氏、養疴在家、特造門相訪、詳詢募捐經過及放賑情形、承馮氏見告如下、</p>
<p>勸募工人不尙宣傳　此次爲救濟兩廣難民而募捐、祗實行動募工作、並未擴大宣傳、蓋余素服膺一爲政不在多言、顧力行何如耳、」之古訓、今幸得各界人士之贊助、未及三月、已集款十有七萬元、其他已認未繳、及尙在勸募中者、猶未計入在內、因此益信余於首次會員大會席上、引述孟子所云「惻隱之心、人皆有之」、「至誠而不動者、未之有也、」洵是千古至理名言、夫振災救難、本無國界種族之分、悲憫之情、人人同具、見人災患而不爲之救䘏者、必無此人、不過視其能力所及而有別耳、故救濟不計金錢之多募、多捐一錢、被難即多受一錢之惠、即其力止有一錢可捐者、亦可盡一錢之義務、其有應捐而未捐者、此則是鄙人等勸導未能詳盡、誠信不足相孚、惟有反求諸已、益努力而不敢自懈耳、</p>
<p>妥籌振濟以副眾望　有子曰「君子務本」、蓋萬事萬物、莫不有本、先端其本、然後功可得而成、救濟事業、以仁慈爲本、果能激發其仁慈心、則無不見義勇爲、推食解衣、惟恐或後矣、故本會同人、祗致力於本之所在、而循序以進行、因思本會成立僅數月耳、同鄉人士、固踴躍輸將、即外省諸慈善家、亦惟我粵人困苦顚連、自動解囊、捐貲相助、足見　　之念、乃出於人性之自然也、捐款者既如此熱心、鄙人等自當妥籌振濟之方、稍杼粵民痛苦、以期無負各善士之厚惠鴻仁焉、</p>
<p>放賑機關均有信譽　募捐難、放賑尤不易、本會常念及捐款人捐助之金錢、其來也不易、故所收捐欵、務以「功歸實際、款不虛糜」、爲唯一之信條、即本會經費、除捐册等印刷費外、其餘亦均由同人自任、不入開支、至實行放賑、因滬粵遙隔、且在戰時、交通阻梗、災區之情况、更不易詳知、爰將賑款交付於旅港巨商林炳炎·蔡昌·蔡增基、三君、即請其爲本會駐港代表·負責主持、而直接赴災區放賑、又分別委託於（一）基督敎華南浸信會、（二）廣州萬國紅十字會、（三）東華醫院、（四）中華基督敎會廣東協會、（五）梁椒蕃牧師主辦之四邑難民救濟機關、（六）陽江城醫院等各團體、此數團體皆爲兩粵辦理救濟事業信譽卓著之機關、如華南浸信會於廣州失守後、即派三隊分往廣西八步·黃寶·樂平·荔浦·一帶、以及廣東西江·新與·一帶、並新會·鶴山。各地、從事於緊急救濟救護、及施醫藥收容難民工作、又在各地組織分會、分團辦理救濟、此外如萬國紅十字會在翁源等及北江千餘里地方、設立臨時醫院、救濟難民、</p>

<p>定四月底結束捐務　本會擬於四月底將捐款作一結束、仍望各界人士、軫念兩粵災情嚴重、迅予救援、至兩粵旅滬同鄉、其有已認捐而未繳款、或尙在勸寡者、均望儘四月底以前、將捐款或捐册送交本會、以資結束、海上不乏樂善君子、定必於此短時期内、慷慨輸資、共襄善舉、想二十萬元捐款之目標、不難如願以償、不禁爲吾兩廣難胞私心稱幸、</p>

<p>日軍敗退新場</p>
<p>南匯僞「軍」、十七日傍晚、圖奪魯匯鎭不逞、被游擊隊一鼓擊敗、傷亡甚衆、僞「軍」野心未戢、十八日（即前日）上午十時、日僞混合軍二百餘名、又山新塲航頭側攻魯滙以南之奉南邊界泰日橋鎭、（屬奉賢縣第三區）華軍在該鎭及四鄉集有兵力五六百名之衆、對日僞軍攻勢、應付綽有餘裕、當即攔截迎擊、再度展開激烈戰事、雙方用槍砲互轟、聲震遠近、激戰數小時後、僞「軍」因被迫在前鋒作戰、且無戰鬥能力、故死傷又有六七十名之衆、游撃隊乘勢包抄壓迫、日僞軍不支、完全敗退航頭新塲、故犯泰計劃、又告失敗、</p>

<p>東戰塲最近形勢、又極形緊張、華軍方面、輩已宣佈於最短期內、將向京滬杭路實行總攻但華方因各地集有偽軍、雖係烏合之衆、究係無知被迫者多數、故特委朱森爲江浙二省招剿救國軍司令、朱業已來滬、咋率屬遄赴某地、計劃招剿僞軍事官、並聞蘇常一帶之熊劍東舊部、將由朱統帶、朱於前日且發出抗戰宜言、</p>

<p>華軍圍攻太倉</p>
<p>太倉自經日軍盤距後、地方蹂躪不堪、而僞縣知事李林士係著名流氓出身、更爲虎作倀、極盡獻媚「主子」之能事、風聲所播、事爲潛伏該縣四郊之游擊隊偵悉、乃欲拘李爲民除害而甘心、乃於前晨（十七日）天色微明之際、發動大軍、前往襲擊、城內日兵本極單薄、聞警不敢頑抗、棄城潰退、游擊隊乃蜂擁前進，當將僞縣府包圍、叫面衝殺、僞知事李林士聞驚喪膽、已早化裝遠麗、僅擊斃僞營二十餘名、游擊隊見目的已達、乃從容凱旋而返、</p>

<h3>大都會遷讓案　業主敗訴　訟費由原告負担</h3>
<p>戈登路靜安寺路口大都會花園舞廳之土地、原屬美商普益地產公司所有、經大都會於廿四年五月七日向該公司租賃、月租七百元、然後在該土地上建築舞廳佈置花園、</p>
<p>經營舞業</p>
<p>、及後該土地所有權即移轉與英商恒業地產公司接收、而大都會之契约、仍予繼續、乃去年十月間恒業公司突通知大都會、自本年一月一日租金由七百元增加至八百五十元、大都會方面除允許加租外、並以原定之不定期租约、頗覺不妥、故特委託英國律師理克司與恒業公司商訂一</p>
<p>定期三年</p>
<p>之租約、屢經書函往返、磋商條件、已經商定各條件正擬正式簽约之際、詎恒業方面突於去年十二月二十八日以書面通知　大都會，着於本年三月三十一日爲止、須將土地返還、並拆除地上之建築物、大都會經理江耀章以恒業公同出爾反爾、</p>
<p>毫無信義</p>

<h3>國際地位的等第</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>誰都知道，各國在國際閒的地位是有等第的，有的是一等國，有的兌二三等國，而等第的上下，則以武力的强弱爲標準，强者上，弱者下。中國在抗戰前，大約在二三等之間，日本則自居於一等之流。現在，事實告訴我們，這樣的等第已經改變了：日本，誠如蔣委員長所說，「已經被我們抗戰壓低到第二等國的地位上去了」，我們，有如一般外國的觀察家所說，已走上一等國的大道了。</p>
<p>這樣的改變，是彼此相反而相成的。換言之，就是二十二個月來的激戰，他們的武力在日逐弱下去，我們的武力則在日逐强起來，所以我們地位的升，造成了他們地位的降。這常然不是憑空的理論，是有事實作根據的。他們有如驕陽下的殘雪，在一片一片消融着，愈久則消融愈甚，無可挽回，無可補救，我們則如播下泥土的穀子，發苗滋長，開花結實，可以收穫更多的穀子。並且殘雪化水，不但無損於穀種，反能促進穀種的生活力，所以他們開始時的來勢洶洶，正有助於我們今日的欣欣向榮。</p>
<p>我們在國際間地位的升高，除了和我們敵人作對比以外，也正可以和別的弱小作並比。在一般弱小間，我們是最先被侵略者，因爲自東北事變以來，至今已經八年了。在這八年之中，起先有阿比西尼亞的被併呑，最近則有奧大利，捷克，阿爾巴尼亞的被消滅，而我們還是巋然獨存，在與打擊者以打擊，並且有完全的把握，可以在不久的將來，光復我們的失土。究竟我們武力是否增强，且不必說，就憑這一點，也足以自處於一等國之林，而毫無愧色了。</p>
<p>蔣委員長又說，「如果我們加緊的抗戰下去，在不久的時期內，必會使他們現在二等國的地位亦站不住。」當然，在我們這方面，到了「給他們一個致命傷的打擊」以後，我們一等國的地位就確保無疑了。</p>
<p>同胞們：我們在國際間，尤其在我們的敵人面前，所受的屈辱，也已經够了，現在我們站起來了，從此，我們格外要站定脚跟，不屈不撓，獲得最後的勝利，在國際間吐氣揚眉才是呀！</p>
<h3>孤獨的時候</h3>
<p>— 高爾基作　范訊譯</p>
<p>昨夜我在通過托洛寇橋時，看見一個年輕的女人靜默地站着。這個嬌小纖細的女人用她那戴着褐色手套的臂勾搭在橋欄上。我望了一會，心想她是要跳到下面的尼娃河去。但是她祇伸出機靈的舌頭，惡意地向太空中的月亮裝模作樣。</p>
<p>月亮像一匹狡猾的老狐，在烟般朦朧的雲間輕逸地溜走。它顯得又紅又大，像一張酒鬼的醉臉。也許這女人曾吃過它的虧。她的動作是有報復性的。至少在我看來，她望着月作勢的舉止是很冷酷的。</p>
<p>看到這件趣事後，我又想起另一些相似的小事，使我在回憶裹放聲狂笑。照我看來，一個人孤伶伶地獨處時—至少他自己以爲旁邊並無他人—的舉動是像一個有精神病的瘋人，我也想不出別的字來稱呼這些做怪動作的人。</p>
<p>我初次看見人在獨居時做反常的動作，還是在幼年時代。在某次馬戲散塲後，我看見飾小丑的英國呆子郎黛爾獻技完畢，沿一倏閱無一人的走廊踱着。當他走過一面大鏡時，突然脫下頭上的高帽子，恭恭敬敬地對自己的影子鞠躬。這裹的確並沒第三個人，但我却就坐在他頭頂上的一條水槽裹。他不會發現我，然而我運他的腿都看得淸淸楚楚。當他對自己彎腰鞠躬時，我還探出頭來望他。這一天我悶悶地思索着，困惑而不能解釋。可是現在我想起來，郎黛爾不過是個蠢漢，是一個以做怪動作爲職業的人，充其量不過是一個英國人罷了。</p>
<p>許多年後的一天，我去訪安敦托基霍夫君，人家告訴我他在花園裹。當我走進園門時，我看到他獨自一人坐在那裹，他正想用帽子捉住太陽光來套在頭上，當然他的癡想是不會成功的。我能看出他怎樣因屢屢失敗而懊惱，他的臉愈漲愈紅，他迅速地把帽子擊着膝蓋，又匆匆地戴在頭上。最後他無意於這不可能的玩意，一脚把身旁的小狗踢開，半閉着眼向天上作了最後的一瞥，躡手躡足地走回自己的屋子。他在門口看到我了，他笑着對我說：「你念過白蒙特諧於節奏的詩嗎？哦！太陽在向小草徵笑呢！好笨的傢伙，不是嗎？在羅西亞它對卡秦（洗衣人）的肥皂泡發笑，在這兒他對革達坦（草）的汗發笑。」</p>
<p>另一次我窺見他想用一枝粗大的紅鉛筆塞進一隻狹頸的藥瓶。當然這是無結果的舉動，他大概知道他正在作打破一條物理定律的大試騐，他用學者堅毅而忍耐的精神來幹這滑稽的把戲。</p>
<p>羅托爾斯泰耳話般輕聲地向一個石龍子說：「嗯！你快樂嗎？」這小動物正伏在灌木叢中的一塊石頭上晒太陽。托兩斯泰靜靜地站在它面前，依舊是他那老樣兒，把手揷在寬大的外衣袋裹。最後，這偉大的文人拘謹地向叫方望望，然後嘆口氣堅決地說：一假使我像你這樣，我是不會感到快樂的。」</p>
<p>大化學家鐵許溫司基坐在自己的餐室裹，手裹執着的淺底茶盤，反映出自己的面影。他向茶盤大聲地呌：「噲！老傢伙！你一個人在做什麽？」但是影子冷冷地不理睬他。鐵許溫司基長長地嘆一口氣，面色逐漸黯淡起來。他對他自己的像蹙着額，痙孿着鼻子，活像一匹老象的皺額和長鼻。</p>
<p>著名小說家李斯科文獨自坐在桌上，把棉花撕成小塊往碗裹一次次摔去。每次這小小而軟的棉花碰擊碗底時，他豎起耳朶聽那棉塊落在碗裹究竟會不會發出響聲。</p>
<p>伏爾迪斯基牧斯把一隻鞋放在他面前，嚴峻地命令它目己行走。「我知道你是不會走的。」他目滿而高傲地說着：「你瞧！沒有我你就不能到你所要到的地方去。」</p>
<p>「你在做什麼？老爸！」我出其不意地闖了進去。他望着我，解朝似的說：「你問我鞋子的事情吧！這鞋子小得只穿到我的脚踵。現在他們老做這種蟞腳的鞋子。」</p>
<p>女人獨自一個在裝飾或嬉戲時，常會目言自語。有一次我看到一個美麗而受過良好敎育的女人，獨自一人坐在窗下的安樂椅上吃糖果。常她每次用精巧的糖果夾鉗舉起她心愛的食物時，她喃喃地說：「現在我要吃你啦！」常她吃完後，她又自言自語地說。。「吃你的不我嗎？」</p>
<p>某劇塲的休息室裏祇有一個遲來的黑髮少婦。她在每面鏡子前都停留一回。突然，我聽得她說：「不過—一個人總要死的。」</p>
<p>此地除了她和我以外。並沒有其他的人。我也是和她一樣的來得太遲而不及進塲。不過我眞來得太遲了，竟來不及看她所演怪劇的前半部。這室內是黑黝黝的，她決不想到室內除她外還有別人。我想她假使看見我，她是決不會向一個生人提出這樣一個不俗的問題的。我想她也不會知道，要與我探討這樣深奧的哲理。</p>
<h3>來得去不得</h3>
<h3>「愛」與「憎」</h3>
<p>— 牆頭草</p>
<p>我將怎樣訴說鬱積着的寥寂呢？迫切的，我急需要聽到人類眞摯的聲音。我會因此而鼓舞，活躍！生命上添放異彩！</p>
<p>呼號，呌喊，帶來的祇是空漠的回響。鉛一般的，我底心凝重—。</p>
<p>失望躊躇嗎？我決不。我要使用生命力至最後的解體才靜止，追求着人類感情交融着的巨溝！</p>
<p>天賦着我們以「愛」「憎」，愛我所應愛的，憎我所應憎的，這不是最眞切的人性又是什麽呢？</p>
<p>營營於利，急急於名，侷促於小天地中胸襟狹窄的生命，除了可憐相以外，是一無所有的。</p>
<p>貧污，狡詐，自私，欺騙，那些建築於人和人之間的圍牆底磚石，竭力加速它們底崩潰吧！</p>
<p>强烈愛着生命的，自然得有强烈的「愛」「憎」慾！出發於人性底「愛」「憎」是合而爲一，無高下好壞之分的。</p>
<p>擴大我們底「愛」「憎」吧！淡如水嗎？不，濃如酒！</p>

<h3>「豔」和「韻」的文統</h3>
<p>— 五陵</p>
<p>我們一向是看不起女子的，但有時却又特別的看得起女子。</p>
<p>在歷史上，每當一不「太平」的時候，大家便要女子給國家爭體面了。那爭體面的方法是：「死」。「賊來了，家主逃命，女子死，死，死。外族侵入了，文官主和，武將投降，女子死，死，死。</p>
<p>死了以後怎樣呢？於是我們底文學家跳出來了：弔詩，輓詩，你步韻，我步韻；甚至先偷偷地做一首或當從甚麽地方抄一首，勉强栽在死人頭上，說是某烈女底絕命詩，接着再和一首，又是你步韻，我步韻。而這就呌作「艷聞」「韻事」，爲的依然是爭體面。</p>
<p>在歷史上，「賊」給我們助成的「艷聞」「韻事」也眞多得很。但所謂賊」，便是我們現代偉人所說的「游來游去」的「流寇」，却都是皇帝和官僚逼出來的。倘沒有皇帝和官僚，也就不會有「艷聞」「韻事」了。因之，我們底文學家歷來便都擁護着皇帝和官僚。外族的侵入，助成我們的「豔聞」「韻事」更加多了，像金人，元人，滿人，那些成績，我們還容易查考出來的。這些外族一面直接製造了「豔聞」「韻事」，一面到後來却都父成了皇帝和官僚，所以我們底文學家到頭還是乾脆地擁護，不管他媽的外族不外族。證據便是那些流傳的弔詩，輓詩，和詩，步韻詩，從來就沒有罵過皇帝和官僚，也沒有駡過外族的淫掠，只是拚命地在「豔」和「韻」上做着工夫。自然，這是「爲藝術的藝術」。但終於在還時候也就露出了「尾巴」：所爭的體面纔實在不是國家底體面，却只是活得健旺的幾個男子底體面罷了。</p>
<p>但是若果有幾個女子偏不肯死又怎樣呢？那豈不是太冷落了文學家嗎？然而又並不。文學家底主意多得很。現在他們是一面罵那女子，一面再捧那女子。罵是罵她沒有廉恥，捧是捧她臉子好看。於是依然是「豔聞」「韻事」，而且這回的「豔」和「韻」更加要「豔」得厲害，「韻」得厲害。結果這回的體面却完全屬於文學家了。</p>
<p>以上說的自然都是已往的情形。至於現代，却稍微有一點變化。女子再不肯死得那樣起勁了，體面雖然還是要的，但也只好另想法子。不過我們底文學家却似乎還抱着已往的主張不放，依然在追求着「豔」和「韻」。然而因爲畢竟是現代，追求的方法也一樣的有了變化，而且也再不赤裸裸地打出「豔」和「韻」的招脾了，有的是更大的題目。</p>
<p>幾年前住在北平的文學家很熱心地在訪賽金花，吹賽金花，約賽金花談話，請賽金花吃飯，結果一本一本的書出來了。據說是爲由她底口中考出滿淸末年的許多掌故的，但即刻却又說原來她知識太差，竟考不出來，實在呌人失望。然而雖然失望，書却還是要出的。於是書中沒有掌故，誇一通淸太后，讀一通德元帥，罵一通「拳匪」，陪襯出來一個「豔」和「韻」完事。</p>
<p>上海打仗了，一個炸彈落在了「大世界」底門前，窮人，工人，小商人，眞不知道死了多少。可是一位文豪由別處來了，經過了這個地方，便做了一首詩，說他好像看見了那兒還留着有炸斷了的摩登女子底染紅了的指甲，別的却一概沒有看見。這眞「豔」得很，「韻」得很。然而這詩是發表出來的，據說也是「救亡文學」的一種。</p>
<p>這回是要創作明末的歷史作品了。於是有文學家出來講話：歷史題材非選擇不可。自然這是對的。但選來選去，却只選出了一個陳圓圓，據說比明末江陰等等地方抗戰的義民要有意義得多。自然，陳圓圓底背境是複雜的，但怎麼却比抗戰的義民還要有意義呢？這初聽去似乎是費解得很，然而只要你知道我們文學家骨子裹面的主張，便會立刻豁然。陳圓圓既能「豔」，又能「韻」，在這一點上，那些義民只有「自慚形穢」了。</p>
<p>追求「豔」和「韻」，是我們底「文統」。失掉了這個「文統」，我們底文學家也許不會有「靈感」吧。</p>

<h3>東倒西歪屋談戲　伶人的改行（下）</h3>
<p>— 南腔北調人</p>
<p>劉小衡初唱老生，常立恒之戲，即係鄰所開蒙，後演花旦，演「狸貓換太子」得名。</p>
<p>芙蓉草，由花旦改老生，不走紅，再改花旦，死心塌地演花旦，所以能享今日的盛譽。</p>
<p>周信芳，不倒嗓時唱鬚生，倒嗓後專攻做工一路，但花臉小生癮很大，不時串演，唱工戲之癮亦大，「探母回令」，照樣來一下，現爲江南做工老生之班頭。</p>
<p>楊菊笙，是小揚月樓之弟，起初兄弟倆同學鬚生，後又同改花旦，小楊月樓唱紅，菊笙沒有唱紅，爲了和小楊月樓配戲的緣故，仍改老生。</p>
<p>貫大元，本唱鬚生，即賈洪林劉景然亦大爲讚許，後改武生，從楊小樓習藝，因爲身體發福，重唱老生。</p>
<p>楊瑞亭，秦腔梆子出身，改入京班，先唱老生，後改武生，兼工武净，後專門唱老生及老旦一路，兼唱紅生，近由許黑珍等之介，從紅豆館主習崑劇。</p>
<p>蓋呌天，初出台時，隸玉仙班，以蓋罩譚呌天爲號召，唱鬚生，倒嗓後改武生。</p>
<p>張國斌，本係唱工老生，爲武旦賽陣風（即蓋呌天之弟張英浦）之子，倒嗓後改武生，與乃弟張質彬合演神亭嶺，爲當年亦舞台之呌座戲，後又改做工老生，以焚綿出一劇蜚聲梨園，現隸大舞台。</p>
<p>姜妙香，初唱靑衣（百代公司當初灌有唱片，可以作證)，兼演花旦，從陳石頭（德霖）學得不少靑衣戲，後因患咯血症而改小生，有女嫁譚富英爲繼室。</p>
<p>張德祿，武生張順來之子，童伶時即出台，擅唱鬚生戲如「李陵碑」之類，倒嗓後，先改武净，又改武生，至今猶以武生應行，腹筍甚寬，能編新戲。</p>
<p>林顰卿，初習武丑，從徐丹靈（是否此三字，待考）習戲，因不搜武工而改爲老生，以林小芬之名出台，倒嗓後始改花旦，頃亦因年邁，授徒以娛晚年，有子幼鄉，能傳衣缽，在杭嘉湖一帶甚有名。</p>
<p>潘海秋，已故名伶潘月樵之嫡子，（現隸共舞台之潘鼎新，乃月樵庶出，）初唱鬚生，名小藜靑，倒嗓後改花旦，隸九畝地新舞台甚久，現因沉於烟霞，爲張冶兒之滑糟劇團後台理事，每天取現份，一個月猶不足十元，甚爲悽慘。</p>
<p>伍逢春，伍月華之子，爲早年三馬路文明大舞台唱中軸之童伶鬚生，倒嗓後改靑衣，再改花旦，後改小生，現以敎戲聞於時，海上多數後起坤旦，都出其門下，唱鬚生時代名武鑄臣。</p>
<p>總而言之，伶人的改行，並非好習時尙，不是爲了嗓子，就是爲了體格，上述不過舉共大略而已，其因特殊情形而改行者不錄。</p>
<h3>朱秋痕加入綠寶　每月薪金二百元　今日演孽海情怨</h3>
<p>— 克維</p>
<p>戰後因為「為了生活」而跌入文明戲的圈子裏雲的，在電影女明星中，我們可以計算同很多人，如夏佩珍）現已赴北平）范雪朋，（在綠寶）葉秋心（在天韻樓）諸人，有一時謠傳「黑眼圈」談瑛也將下海，後來因爲倏件沒有談妥，以致沒有實現。</p>
<p>今天起，綠寶又有一位影星下海了，這人提起大家或許不會忘記，那就盛傳一度嫁人的北平姑娘朱秋痕。</p>
<p>朱秋痕的身世，我們簡略地知道她以前在北平是演舊劇的，到了上海以後即加入明星公司，戰前因爲出去拍外景，有人謠傳她和　　　有過一段小小的戀愛糾粉，弄得她和明星公司不十分開心，後來謠傳她將嫁一位大學生，兩人一同到北平去，她自己也放棄銀幕生活，預備入校求學，想不到她的夢想後來竟沒有實現，跟着她竟「爲了生活」和其他女星一樣，下海加入「綠寶」了。</p>
<p>朱秋痕這次加入綠寶，是綠寶股東周邦俊先生介紹的，以一位影星的頭銜加入綠寶，因之她的薪水，比一般電影公司影星薪水也大得多，每月據說有二百元。（綠寶幾位重要角色，薪水差不多都有一二百元）</p>
<p>今天起，朱秋痕將以一偭新影難的姿態，在綠寶劇塲上出現，她演的劇目是呌「孽海情怨」，從此，文明戲塲中，又多一位影星了。</p>
<p>最後使人感觸的，就是改良文明戲這一運動，「綠寶」雖然演出水準比較別個文明戲塲子高，但是下海演文明戲的幾位影星，她們的確都不是爲了「改良文明戲」而再去下海的，她們下海的主因，只不道是「爲了生活」呵！</p>

<h3>顧夢鶴冤禁</h3>
<p>足足關了十六小時　已於前日下午釋出</p>
<p>當顧夢鶴加入皇后劇院演文明戲的時候，也正是「改良文明戲」論爭最激烈的時候，後來他加入綠寶，除了自已登台演戲以外，同時還擔任編劇兼導演，我們以爲在「改良文明戲」運動富中，顧夢鶴還是比較有頭腦的。</p>
<p>前兩天，顧夢鶴因爲和一個朋友接洽劇本的事悄，在深夜十二時左右，經過福煦路成都路，那天晚上法租界檢查行人特別嚴厲，當盤查的時候，不知怎麼顧夢鶴竟和他們衝突起來，當時並在顧夢鶴身上搜出一張爲巡捕所不認識的東西，於是好像更有理由的，便把顧夢鶴帶到巡捕房裹去了。</p>
<p>顧夢鶴眞有什麽可疑之點麼？當然沒有的，但是那張使巡捕不認識的「怪紙」到有點費勁的，於是顧夢鶴頭一天晚上就押在巡捕房，應了舊小說上所謂「一宿無話」的老套，但是顧夢鶴這一夜確不好受。</p>
<p>到第二天，那張「怪紙」馬上找人翻譯出來，却是一首平常「歌譜」，一直到下午四時，才算把他釋放出來，巡捕房裹的外國人，臨走並且對他表示歉意。</p>
<p>在道樣無辜的關了十六個鐘頭當中，一點東西都沒有得吃，第一椿使他難受的，就是他那不張氣的肚子，實在快餓穿了。風雨</p>

<p>龐虛齊收藏入江海浩瀚，富甲全國，茲會出品，尙非得意精品，然吳仲圭蘆溝寒雁，雅有漁父圖一角之致；而劉完庵夏雲欲雨，直爲斯會冠冕。王謝家七尺珊瑚，皆爲盆景，旁人出此，幾窮箱櫝矣。</p>
<p>吳湖帆出品，當以董其昌吳玄水合作一軸爲壓卷，此畫玄宰推崇玄水甚至，然予觀之，則玄宰筆墨十居八九，駸駸直度元人。予平生尊董，而此軸與淸宮大幅又董皇也。宋湯正仲梅花，明周臣山水，一爲湖帆婦家奩物，一爲愙齊公手鑒精品，覩物觀人，不遺先澤，湖兄此舉，有足多者。唯鍾馗補袞圖，標稱五代，不無遺憾，雲笈七籤，始有鍾葵嫁麼之語，齊東野語，以麼作魅，轉訛作妹，而後，鍾進士嫁妹始見於雜劇，五代人不當爲此也。予觀茲會唐宋畫無憾者，惟湯正仲梅花，與周昉戲嬰，若舉寗闕之義，其他不列可也。大雅以爲如何？</p>
<p>張葱玉收畫必以紙白板新爲目標，故所藏多精，周昉一卷，的是佳作。予讀宋人筆記，謂唐吳道子周昉畫仕女，皆作歛眉黑脣，形容悽慘，蘇老泉亦有是言，五行志以爲服妖，蓋其時婦女風尙然也。今吳畫已不可見，周畫仕女亦絕不爾，唐子畏學周防最善，亦不爾，豈宋人所見，是偶然歟？元劉元作司馬仲才華蘇小妹圖，是予舊蓄，葱玉愛而讓之，觀者多不知劉元爲何許人，按兀，即劉藍也，善造象，雲南人，世傳雲南笻竹寺羅漢卽出其手，後有柳貫題並黃子久觀款一行，印爲鐵笛道人，葱玉以爲僞，割而歸予，亦藝林之辛秘也。葱玉出品，予最喜華新羅紅蕖翠鳥一幅，若與鷺鶩風葦相歡語者，全是一片天機，活潑潑地。他如莫雲卿之淸雋，漸江之冷逸，足與湖帆所列王寵之豐腴，並爲鼎足，皆不可多得者。若王振鵬揭缽圖，則張藏出品之甲觀矣。</p>
<p>丁惠康初不蓄盡，近則藏甚勇，茲會即所發起，有八大之蘭雁，及鄒方魯山居，皆足爲精品。金陵八家雖非大手筆，然鄒喆謝蓀胡糙並爲稀見之跡，今會所列，竟得鄒之山居，並趙友卿所藏胡石公密林，亦足珍矣，惠康有劉完庵一幅，極似董香光，而廉悍過之，或謂可疑，惠康遂摒而不陳，足見其從善矣。然予以爲香光之法，本出營邱巨然，而組合之，完庵工力無復多讓，變筆爲之，亦無不可，上有楊循吉題，的眞，必屛勿取，亦刻舟矣，願共大雅論之。</p>

<p>股票交易、成交紗布交易　股五十股、價為三十九元七角半、比前又高半元餘、眾業公所股市成交及人心稍有進展、買戶亦見較多、公用股（如電車及公共汽車）會德豐及業廣設均有良好需求、匯通洋行經理之英商楂華橡皮有限公司、昨經董事會決定派給一九三八年份末次股息、每股國幣七角五分、連雲年所派中期股息每股力幣二角五分、兩共派給國幣一元、此項股息俟提出五月四日股東大會宣佈後、即可定期開派、人心甚覺滿意、故對於其他橡皮股亦略增興趣、惟多數買戶出價低廉、怡和股穩定、毫無變動、政局雖仍飄　不定、但感覺在遠東方面局勢、似已達到最惡劣地位、今或在短近期間有調解之可能、此說於素抱悲觀者、恐亦懷此望想、</p>
<p>又匯通洋行經理之楂華康沙來特橡皮咖啡有限公司、亦於日昨由董事會決定一九三八年份股息、每股國幣五分、俟於五月四日舉行之股東大會宣布後、即可不日開派雲、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票、本月十八日（星期二）掛牌行市、漲跌殊屬有限、計麥加利銀行股微縮二先令六辦士、價為七鎊十二先令六辦士、匯豐銀行香港註冊股回升半鎊、價為八十二鎊半、開平煤礦股上升六辦士、價為十七先令、餘無變動、</p>

<p>倫敦中國外債本月十八日（星期三）掛牌行市、尚少榮辱、惟腳地依然軟弱、英德續借款、英發債票自上月八日七十八鎊之高價逐步下跌、以迄前日為止、已跌落十四鎊之钜、至昨盤始見回升半鎊、價為六十四鎊半、克利斯浦公債則跌落半鎊價為三十六鎊半、又廣九鐵路公債亦跌五先令、價</p>
<h3>金融　殷富脫售　現金轉向下挫　港幫雖購為數有限</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、沉寂之至、毫無精彩、唯潛勢突轉下疲、蓋因邇來本市殷富、對於黃金吸購收藏、興趣渺小、且鑒當日報載、德義對於羅斯福總統之和平建議、態度冷淡、故脫售心思益切、某錢兌業及現金號相繼代殷富拋塞、雖某銀樓續代港幫吸購、奈其數有限、且其他客幫均懷觀望、故在交易濟稀中供者較多、價遂不支步降、結果軋跌五元、成交亦頗寥落、僅二百兩、銀樓飾金仍懸原價、海關金呆定、中英純金等復向下遊、</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因本市殷富脫售心思頗切、且港幫吸購不力、故潛勢下疲、十時許首見某錢兌業售予某銀樓三十兩、二千零七十七元五角為開盤價、較之前收做低二元五角、開後現金號亦跟蹤吐售、塞予某銀樓共七十兩、價均七十七元、繼之某錢兌業又賣予某銀樓五十兩、價七十六元、此後多方仍想脫手、奈某銀樓已中止吸收、且其他更無納胃、致難做開、延至午時賣價仍為七十六元、午後因買者仍缺、形勢仍疲、致交易亦清、僅見某錢兌業吐予某錢兌業仍喊七十五元賣出、但進者祇還價七十三元、方肯吸納、延至晚收未見做開、故晚收仍作二千零七十五元、結果較隔昨晚收軋跌五元、全天僅二元五角差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千零八十元、收進二千零七十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、因烚赤變動不大、故仍懸原價、大同行為二百十一元、新同行二百零九元、收進二百零三元、</p>
<p>純金回降半便士</p>
<p>十八日倫敦電、英純金每盎司回降半便士、計退達七鎊八先令六便士、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦回降至一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六　、上海標準標金價亦回縮三角、計一千二百零七元六角、</p>
<h3>日行扒給　遠期美匯</h3>
<p>匯市昨雖各大洋行結款仍繁、兼德士古火油公司亦起扒吸、但以外行如匯豐等仍有盡量供塞、於是潛勢極平、結果均無軒輊、唯六月份美匯、因日行扒結、且天津幫不肯廉賣、是以為狀略帶軟化、半天交易不寂、至港匯因雙方供求轉稀、故狀況愈穩、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期長〇六二五、遠期升一二五、美銀呆定如故、倫敦生金跌半辦士、匯兌英對美·對滬均平、對法小三生丁、美對英降〇六二五、對滬仍平、對法未更、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英匯八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、較之前收、均無上落、開後日行首先互做七月份英匯八辦士二三四三七五、繼之日行扒結外行有利（代天津幫）六月份美匯十六元、是以為狀略帶軟化、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉大二厘半、計徵百分之五·二五、此後洋行雖來扒結、但以外行供意仍濃、故形勢頗形穩定、洋行購進匯豐·麥加利英匯八辦士二五、兼油洋行德士古亦結進某行美匯十六元〇六二五、後華行互做英匯八辦士二五、將近午時、交易轉清、惟港匯略有做開、外行安達賣予洋行港匯五十六元、狀況亦平、迨平收銀行賣價英匯八辦士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、港匯五十六元、結果較隔昨晚收、英美港三匯、均無榮辱、午後週三無市、</p>
<h3>價比匯票廉　美金票不乏收藏</h3>
<p>昨日英純金跌半辦士、英美匯兌降零六二五、本埠外匯洋行結款甚旺、日銀行需要亦殷、幸外銀行供給暢盛、市價乏變、穩定如前、烚赤開盤微軟、金號錢兌業互有供求、形勢盤旋帶軟、交易呆滯未暢、下午市況仍滯鈍、客戶買意淡薄、收盤趨軟、外幣英美金鎊、供求較稀、變動頗微、英金票需要未盛、美金票交易頗旺、客戶納胃甚暢為數頗钜、想係收藏者、因市價較匯票為廉、香港票供求尚旺、價呈穩定、朝鮮票需要甚稀、市值愈廉、僅值幣八角五分、公會交易未盛、惟成交金額尚钜、長泰出鴻昌進英金鎊十個、又出晉大進美金票三千五百元、祥康出承泰進、美金匯票一百元、同豐出承泰進美金票五百元、昨日市價、英金鎊降五分、英金票升一分、美金票升一分三　、法郎票降二毫半、德金票降五分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>香港申匯平定</h3>
<p>津滬兌小一元四</p>
<p>（香港）十九日電、匯兌行市、上午開盤與十八日下午二時三十分比較、美匯縮〇六二五、英申匯價、未有變動、至十一時半、英美申匯市、均無變化、下午週三無市、茲將上午開盤市價列下</p>
<p>（天津）十九日電、匯兌行市、與上日比較、英匯放長〇九三七五、美匯放長二五、申匯跌一元四角、市面堅定、茲將上午開盤市價列後、</p>
<h3>大條上漲</h3>
<p>十八日倫敦電、銀市大眾及投機家少數買進、缺乏供給、市面平、收盤後、斷續平平、近期照掛牌價有人想進、出者是觀望、大條銀近期長〇六二五、遠期微乎其微一二五、紐約電、美銀現貨呆定如故、又孟買電、印銀市況平靜、現期貨仍均無更動、</p>
<h3>華北法幣　信用日高　天津「偽鈔」再跌</h3>
<p>天津十九日電、偽「聯銀券」暗盤行市、上午開盤與十八日上午開盤較、續猛賤七元五角、價為一百二十三元五角、（係法幣百元之價、即「聯銀券」一元祇值法幣八角零九厘七毫）、</p>
<h3>糧食　粉市廠盤定局　洋粉猶在喊高　本麥日商續辦</h3>
<p>廠粉　昨日粉市廠盤、續居定局、二號粉本客一律暫守四元四角半原盤、惟客幫交易、已漸趨怠懈、查北洋幫自掃墓節假期以外來、運出麵粉已有三十萬零二千五百包、且聞當地新有洋粉裝到、故新交易已鮮盡興、南洋幫兩星期來、運雲麵粉亦有七萬三千四百包之數、故於整批交易、殊乏添辦之意、僅零星點綴交易而已、全日成交併計三萬余包、又聞北洋幫所銷之炮車牌粉、續有別小五分之說、及市上回籠貨各牌亦有降小二分半至五分者、市面前途、或有變化之可能、查麵粉出口、昨有二萬包、運往泉州、今（二十日）出口、有三萬二千五百包、運往天津、又一萬三千三百包、運往汕頭、又昨有麩皮二萬包、運往泉州、</p>
<p>洋粉　昨日洋粉市面、尤見挺秀、據國外來電、近日以少雨供給減縮、而出口美麥已達一〇、九六三、〇〇〇斛之數、加以歐局關係、市面重振、是以各洋行粉麥兜價一致喊高遠期定貨均告沉靜、市上現洋粉供給、亦較稀少、蓋因囤戶手中之貨、擬待善價而沽、而客幫因前進之貨、尚未悉數裝出、亦鮮添辦之意、僅本街零星交易、成交不足萬包、如輪船牌價須四元四角半匯劃、紅日當天老牌及花鳥蝙蝠等牌、供源已感缺乏、故售手尤在喊高雲、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日小麥市場、略有少數成交、查長江來源、新由新港運來六百七十七包、及京鎮麥零星到貨、併計約計千包、各廠進胃平淡、客化亦鮮活動、且均擬選擇高貨、故市面毫無特象、結果成交京鎮中次麥三百餘包、價為六元八角二分、因品質關係、售價別低、聞該貨續由日商辦去雲、</p>
<h3>杜米囤戶觀望　客中次貶價</h3>
<p>杜米各幫來源、河下共有十四五號、車輪包子、蘇同崑等幫三千餘包、到貨雖似較夥、但售方因見天時仍陰、心思尚堅、扳持猶力、無如銷場亦屬不佳、本街既淡、囤戶亦多觀望、致各貨大都未能做開、市面遂呈定中帶軟之局、若厚薄粳已見貶修數分、杜洋尖埠尖及變元供求相埒、仍守原盤、</p>
<p>客　近日到頭雖微、而市面終因淡銷見疲、昨南京蕪湖各　由車輪兩路裝到三千餘包、行販均已出樣求售、中次各檔尤圖貶價早脫、蓋中次存底較豐、天熱後容易蒸黴、故均不願久擱、惟昨日客囤依然觀望、統市祇本街去一千多包、行情則高貨小六七分、中次降角許、</p>
<h3>紗花化險為夷　棉紗囤戶見機斬結　廿支紗未能隨粗細紗同趨前進</h3>
<p>紗市依然不脫平穩之境、但實需不及昔日之旺、故人氣稍定、而入於徘徊之狀、但廣西一路交易尚不薄、由廣州灣輸送、二十支雙馬特金城生意因之較為活潑、惟雲南幫納胃略滯、潮汕幫購辦轉銷售於後方、市場成交尚能支持、市價極其安謐、但有一部份囤戶、因吃過風險、低價時堅、持未曾斬結、業已化險為夷、認為知足、並且稍能獲利、在市求售、於是市盤仍在四百〇二三元中盤旋、前途是否發現新恣態、希望實銷來推動、不過十支紗價節節前進、三二支四二支紗線市價殊昂、念支紗照此比例、亦可帶挺、午後同業及囤戶搜羅、異常興旺雲、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、香港幫仍有需要、但採辦比前日少、開價仍維持原狀、二十支唑馬紗為四百〇二元、比上日加五角、少頃廣西幫亦來收辦、市象帶昂、漸增高至四百〇三元、入後又以獲利多頭稍吐、及生意又停滯下挫、迨至收盤、二十支雙馬紗價為四百〇一元半、午後客銷續佳、囤戶吸收尤烈、市價銷昂、結果全日成交一千五百九十包、行情二十支雙馬天女與上日不相上下、惟十支組紗漲風甚熾、三二支四二支亦步塵於後、廠方由德豐廠開出十支雙獅六百包、價為三百〇八元、八十支雙獅四百包、價為三百〇四元、六十支金雙獅五十包、價為二百八十八元半、絡續出貨、昨由香港來紗二十件、今日出口棉紗有五百二十件運天津、三百四十件運汕頭、一百八十件運香港、茲將各幫口價支之額量分列於左、</p>
<h3>津貼問題尚無確切辦法　美棉空戶紛紛掉期　市價因之激漲：滬埠交易轉靜</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約析市、昨日五月份又漲十磅音、滬上各廠商均又深憂棉價之將再漲也、殊不知二時來紐約漲價之原因、奈在五月份交割期迫、各同業前以貨款析放出在即、故空頭籌碼殊為巨大、惟等待已有數日、而天天盛傳放出及給予出口津貼之貨款棉、迄今尚無確切辦法、故各空戶紛紛掉期、因之二日來五月份猛漲二十五磅音、七月份漲十四磅音、而十月份以下之新花祇漲三五磅音、日來歐洲政局混亂、美棉輸出數量不增、布疋銷數難有起色、有此主因、棉價難以見好也、昨日印度連同預測跌半羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、折合法幣、計美棉及巴西每擔八角、印棉跌二角、埃及棉漲六角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、各廠均因外棉漲價、殊為靜寂、況日來到貨甚多、故各廠對於訂購原棉較為有鬆懈、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價計算如下、</p>
<p>日紗市情之堅挺、原因謂拋定額子太多、越過常軌、於是洋行方面、不肯開出、擠軋之風未息、故實際交易雖不旺、然市價難鬆、二十支　鳳紗本月份價為三百六十元、</p>
<p>本棉生意、微見活動、但市勢無甚榮辱可言、華商永安廠買進打包花五百件、亦係拼和印紡紗之需用、德豐廠辦組紗原料百包、查該廣在市開售六支·十支·八支粗紗、額量已近五六千包、對於原料、當有補進之舉、無奈皆購印棉抵補矣、實則本棉價格既貴、而現貸缺乏、棉市前途、就此不尷不尬之局面、絕無精彩可言也、蘇北來源寥若晨星、碼頭上僅到通花一百三十七包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日絲又創新紀錄　為近十年來稀有之高價　本市輯晨經跟漲五十元</h3>
<p>國外絲漲風甚熾、橫濱現貨晨開一一九〇元至一二〇〇元、為近十年來稀有之高價紀錄、遠期一〇九四元、計前者漲五十七元、後者漲四十七元、紐約絲市竭力追隨、日絲八三分漲七分、七五分漲八分、上海絲七八分漲七分、近期標準絲開二·四三元、足證前日電傳二·二六元、定為二·三六元之誤、然則亦高騰七分、遠期貨漲七分半、日美絲市、幾入白熱狀態中、紐約一市成交絲額達二二七〇擔、其堅俏盛況、可見一般、惟下午橫濱收盤、除本月份近期漲上五元外、其他自現貨至各月期貨、均已一致下回、計現貨跌十元、遠期跌二十五元雲、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、昨趨勢似較混亂、自日美告騰漲、而似無止境之後、人心驚喜疑懼、莫衷一是、致昨日白廠絲交乃轉呆滯觀望、大部交易、均為前日發電、洋行照購之數、七八分白廠昨漲二三十元、輯裏經六個號子麒麟跑馬等級漲起五十元、計白廠成交五十擔、輯裏做開九十擔、用戶絲市、白廠B字吃價一千六百元、因購方進胃微小、絲價似難迅速隨升、乾　市價、開已漲至四百四十元、較上週漲起三十元、然則絲本將提升至一千六百五十元之上矣、</p>
<p>十九日茶葉出口運歐洲一百噸、廿日又有八十四件運天津、十七件運青島、十八件運香港、</p>
<h3>油餅　市傳運油千餘桶　日可到　行情猛跌一元　生油亦看下挫</h3>
<p>昨花生油賣買互　無市、刻因不源相接、恐須下挫、豆油來源、除其他各油絡繹不到外、昨市傳又有一千餘桶　日可到、以致人心動撼、辦胃亦減、市氣即呈下遊、罕有之漲風、頓告　跡、大連現油跌一元、成交一百五十桶、價自四十四元五角、跌至四十四元、又路貨五十餘桶、價為四十三元八角、連歧大簍祇交易一百件、價為四十二元五角、跌至四十二元、在收盤時回上二角、為四十二元二角、路貨膠州油做開一百件、價為三十二元、</p>

<h3>疋頭　福州幫來電止裝　川滇實銷復轉呆滯　粗布漲風已見端倪</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>漂染布疋售盤平定、南華各幫、實需轉滯、緣用滇黔郵包停寄四十欠天後、甫於十七日恢復、郵件擁擠不堪、聞又將暫停收寄、故梳妝打扮貨採辦、又須暫緩、成交轉清、購定各貨、交解仍盛、福州幫以日艦有刦留航輪之舉、深具戒心、十八夜來電各貨止辦、已辦定者、一律緩裝、祇粵汕頭雷州各口、辦胃較佳、成交色布斜漂布府綢等貨六千餘疋、白貨細布、細布五六十包、白貨售盤趨勢均堅、細布漲五分至一角、大鵬牌漲五分、現市售開十三元七角半、遠期五·六月份開售三五十包、價十四元、細斜售盤漲一角左右、染廠及業外囤戶成交最旺、綜計三百餘包、而粗布粗斜經囤戶努力吸收、加以實銷之扶植、亦已激起漲風、本街及浙東溫臺幫成交六百餘包、怡和貨占額最巨、售盤怡和粗布缺檔漲五分至一角、大生廠粗布存貨垂　、市盤激漲、十六磅魁字藍獅每疋各漲三角、</p>

<h3>雪裏蕻的榮譽</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>菜肴中的雪裏蕻，（亦寫雪裏紅，簡稱雪菜，）可說是最平民化的佐膳食品，因為它價廉，而又鮮美可口，所以本刊華英女士的經濟菜單中，常見採入，如雪菜煎豆腐，雪菜燒黃魚等等；而葷菜　饌中，泰半可以將它加入稍許，其味必更增鮮美，正仿佛國藥中的甘草，大有處處用得著之概。</p>
<p>最近據報載星加坡消息，我國的雪裏蕻（醃菜）近來首次運往英國倫敦發售，經過英國的醫師化驗後，認為此菜，含有多量的維他命，極富營養，而冠以「生命菜」的美名，此亦足見口有同嗜無分中外的，而我國由此又開蔬菜行銷海外的新利源，更獲得彼邦人士的讚許，這未始不可引為榮譽的一件事！</p>
<p>按辭源載：「雪裏蕻為蔬類植物，葉有銳鋸齒及缺刻，類芥菜，而葉稍織，花黃，雪天諸菜凍損，此菜獨青，故名，味稍辛辣，多醃以為　，北人謂之春不老，按唐韻菜心長白蕻，」依此而論，它既在雪中過冬頁生長，其性質或亦如豌豆而性熟，然否尚須質之醫藥家。</p>
<p>雪裏蕻有人也稱它鹽　菜，關於此，尚有一故事：「宋范文正公（仲淹）少時貧困，讀書長白僧舍，煎粟二升，作粥一器，經宿遂凝，以刀劃為四塊，早晚取二塊，斷蓋數十莖，啗之」由以知古賢刻苦自勵的精神，正堪為後世效法。</p>
<p>最後我希望製雪裏蕻的人，勿以它暢銷海外，便粗製濫造，應當力求改良，產量固然要使其增加，更宜顧到口味腴美，那才可以長期保持海外市場的銷路。</p>
<h3>關於電車讓座</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>坐在電車裏面，看見有女人上來，為了很擠，找不到座位，你便把自己的座位讓給伊。大家知道，這便是所謂西洋文明。然而自從這種西洋文明介紹到中國以後，我們在電車裏時常看見中國人把座位讓給外國太太，而難得看見有西洋人把座位讓給華籍婦女。也許外國人所謂文明的禮節，是有著不同的分野，而另一面，也可看出他們對於中國人是怎樣看待。</p>
<p>在電車裏，把座位讓人，本來不限女人，看見老人，孩子，也都應把座位讓給他們。然而大多數的中國人，祇知把座位讓給女人，而不知把座位讓給老幼，而且同樣是女人，甚至會有人祇揀服裝，面貌漂亮的讓，服裝簡樸，面貌醜陋的女人，就是立在自己的面前，也當做不見。其實電車根本不在服裝，面貌，凡是女人，都得要讓給伊們，尤其是手裏挽著或抱著孩子的，你就是格外要讓得快些。</p>
<p>看見女人，果然要讓座，看見老人，孩子，也要讓給他們。但讓電車的範圍，在我以為還不止如此，就是男人，他手裏抱著孩子，找不到座位，你也應把座位讓給他，還有手裏拿了七包八裹，不勝其重，而走上電車，找不到座位，不拘男女，你也應把座位讓給他們。有時我們在電車裏面，看見走上來的是難得到上海來的鄉下人，找不到座位，為了不大坐電車，所以立在電車裏東搖西擺，像要跌倒的樣子，這種不能在電車裏站立的人，我們也應讓座的。能夠這樣，邦麼讓座的含義，也就比較廣而正確了。</p>
<p>另一面，不拘是老人，女人，有人把座位讓給他們，有的坐了下來，含笑稱謝，作為表示感激，但也有不客氣的坐下去，理都不理睬你，像是應當讓給他們的。其實人家讓你是一種禮節，這不是你應得的權利，祇是人家站在同情的觀點上，才讓你的。那麼人家以禮貌待你，你就應以禮貌還人，雖然讓電車的人不一定要換你的稱謝，可是被讓座的人，含笑稱謝，原是不可不的，才可表示你有禮貌，決不能存應該讓你而不理睬人的心的，關於這點，也是應當知道的。</p>

<p>食鹽為人生日用之品，無論直接間接的服量，每日每人，至少須有三錢，此為吾國古語相傳，即在生理學家，亦謂每人每年，至少需用食鹽十五磅至十八磅，然則八口之家，每月用鹽但有十磅已足，大可自製生理食鹽，以達盡美盡善之目的。其法甚簡，並不必需機械設備，普通用之搪磁面盆，即為良好工具，先以五倍之水，溶化粗鹽，（即每一斤鹽用水四斤化之）則見穢濁如泥漿然，靜置若幹時後，俟其泥垢下沈，扱取上清液於磁盆中，另以純碱化五倍之水，（純碱即炭酸鈉或用土碱亦可），徐徐加入於上述之鹽水中，好生雲霧狀之凝結物，以加至不生雲霧為止。（加入量之多寡各地產鹽不同，大約多至百分之廿，少至百分之三，必使攪勻之，後濾取其清液少許，試再加入碱液，以不再生雲霧為度）於是用布過濾，雲其沈澱。再於上清液中，加之鹽化鋇液少許，亦以加至不生雲霧止。（鹽化鋇可於西藥房購取亦以廿倍之水化用）於是濾清去腳，即入磁盆中，於爐火上煎乾，（在溶縮時宜時時攪拌勿令結底）即可放於磚塊上，攤曬成紛，其白如雪，其味極鮮美，比之市售精鹽，尤為純粹，此即西藥房中所售之生理食鹽也。上海需售每磅八角，但猶不能如此之純，凡欲試其純與不純，但用其鹽化水，試以上述二品，如加碱水能生雲霧，即為含有綠化鈣與硫酸鎂之證，如加鹽化鋇能生雲霧，則為含有硫酸鉀鈉鹽之證。硫酸鉀能治肥胖病，故能使人消瘦，食鹽中如含鉀鹽，則積少成多，能使食欲減少，而生活力將受莫大影響。菜食之人，往往形銷骨立，枯　如柴，即由植物性之食品中，所含鉀質，能消脂肪，不但不能得到純粹之綠化鈉與之交換，且在粗鹽中尤多含有硫酸鹽類，足以助紂為虐。故吾以為家庭中對於生理食鹽之需要，實不可以姑息因循，蓋如上述方法，操作甚易，一月之中，但製一次，已足應用，比之淘米洗菜，必需日日排定功課者，其繁簡正不可以同日語也。至其所耗，實至細微，如其所用燃料，不用煤而用柴，尤可以柴灰自行提碱，但凡松柴一類，其灰浸水，著手不滑者，即不提碱，現在碱價奇昂，內地居民，大可隨地收灰製碱，惜为衣食住行之範圍所限，不便　入本篇，或者於衣之洗濯問題中，另著一篇以資貢獻如何。</p>
<h3>星期一經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>雞蛋是食補中一件極好的東西，安的維太命是非常豐富的。制法種種不一，委實是述不勝述。家常菜中，如荷包蛋，蛋花湯等，我們是常可以吃到的。春季銀魚上市，這銀魚炒蛋，倒又是一樣很好的時鮮菜。銀魚，俗稱　長魚，單獨烹煮，實在沒有什麼味兒，非與雞蛋同炒不可，還須加些韭芽在內，才相得益彰。此外還有一樣菜，也是利用雞蛋的。呌做蛋皮肉絲拌韭芽，將雞蛋黃白打和，放在油鍋中攤成蛋皮，切成粗條子，再將煮熟的肉絲筍絲，泡熟的韭芽，加了醬油麻油同拌，吃起來很覺爽口。要是不喜吃韭芽，那麼可以水芹芹，或綠豆芽為代，你倘要吃得講究一些，那麼不用肉絲，索性用雞絲火腿絲，也未嘗不可。</p>

<p>Increasing in Intensity</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Japanese official dispatches, the Soviet Union is currently assisting the Chinese army in its offensive in southern Shanxi. A Japanese spokesperson claimed that Chinese artillery units are now using Soviet tactics and artillery methods. When asked if this was due to Chinese personnel trained in the Soviet Union, the spokesperson replied that he believed Soviet personnel were firing the artillery. Fierce battles are ongoing on many front lines in North China. In the past few days, there have been five decisive battles in North China, two near Baoding, one south of Kaifeng, and the rest northeast of Beiping. The war in various parts of Shanxi Province is becoming increasingly intense and shifting towards the center of Shanxi. The battles in northern Henan and central Hebei are also continuing, but neither side seems to have achieved a major victory. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

On the night of the 15th, a Chinese unit again attacked two artillery positions on the mountains northeast of Shihe Village, first completely destroying the secondary defensive works. The Japanese defenders retreated into their final positions, stubbornly resisting from their fortified positions. The battle lasted until dawn, when the Japanese position was weakened. The Chinese army launched a courageous charge, forcing the Japanese army to flee in disarray. The Chinese army killed over thirty Japanese soldiers with broadswords. Eight of the remaining troops stumbled and fell into mountain gullies. After occupying the artillery positions, the Chinese found a destroyed mountain gun and captured another large gun, over sixty artillery shells, and twenty rifles. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The War Zone Covers Nine Provinces, Most of the Land is Still Governed by China, The Japanese Army Occupies Less Than Eight Percent of the Land</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Butler gave a written response in the House of Commons today to a question from Labour Party member Pike, stating that according to the latest figures from Chinese official sources, the Chinese government has full administrative power over 61.5% of the nine provinces where the Japanese army is operating. It has administrative power over 7.5% of the areas occupied by the Japanese army, and administrative power over 31.1% of the areas where Chinese and Japanese troops each occupy a portion. Moorehead, an official in the India and Burma Affairs Department, answered a question from a certain member of parliament, stating that it is expected that the improvements currently underway will allow the Yunnan-Burma Road to remain open during the rainy season, and that there is an adequate supply of automobiles in four towns on the border. The Burmese section of the highway has not been specially protected against air attacks. Furthermore, Butler answered a question from Labour Party member Barling, stating that there are now war reports from the Kaifeng area, but it is impossible to know exactly what is happening. In addition, there have been no major changes in the Chinese situation since the Easter parliamentary recess. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied to an inquiry from opposition Labour MP Buck, saying, "According to figures recently released by the National Government of China, there are a total of nine provinces where Japanese troops are present, of which 61.5 percent of the area is still under Chinese administration, the area controlled by the Japanese army accounts for only 7.5 percent, and the remaining 31.1 percent is still under Chinese administration in part, and under Japanese control in part."

<h3>British Ambassador Arrives in Chongqing Yesterday to Handle Routine Business, No Special Mission</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, accompanied by staff member Secretary David Beadle and four others, departed from Kunming by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane on the 19th and arrived in Chongqing at 4:35 p.m. Chiang Kai-shek's representative Dong Xian Guang, Executive Yuan representative Zhang Pingqun, Foreign Ministry representative Duan Maolan, and British Consul-General in Chongqing Dayer all went to the airport to welcome him. The ambassador disembarked first, and the welcoming party immediately stepped forward to greet him. The ambassador returned the greetings one by one. At the time, our Foreign Ministry representative also presented the British ambassador with a copy of today's English-language "Free West News" containing an important speech by Chiang Kai-shek for him to read. The ambassador then returned to the Diplomatic Guesthouse to rest with his staff. Earlier this month, when the ambassador was in Shanghai, he met with British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie. According to reports, the two ambassadors discussed the Far East issue. Later, after Ambassador Craigie returned to Japan from Shanghai, he issued a statement saying that his trip to China had no special mission and that Britain's policy towards the Far East remained unchanged. The return of Ambassador Clark Kerr to Chongqing is to handle routine diplomatic business and has no other special mission. However, the ambassador's arrival in Chongqing today coincides with Chiang Kai-shek's important speech to Chinese and foreign journalists denouncing the theory of surrender and expressing his determination to resist the war. Therefore, the ambassador's determination to resist the war in China should be even clearer after this trip to Chongqing. (19th Telegram)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Dispute over the Prohibition of Flag Display in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the day for promoting industry and commerce during National Spiritual Mobilization Week, so people from all walks of life in the two special districts of Shanghai voluntarily hung national flags to show their enthusiasm. Unexpectedly, in the French Concession, a conflict occurred between the police and citizens due to the prohibition of flag display. Fearing that the situation would escalate, the French Concession authorities have returned the national flags and released the detained citizens. It is hoped that the unfortunate incident can be brought to a close. During the tense situation, the citizens of the French Concession were greatly angered, and some stores even closed their doors in protest. For the sake of promoting friendly relations between countries and dispelling misunderstandings, we must offer sincere advice to the French authorities and the citizens.</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities and the citizens have always maintained a very good and close relationship. Especially since the outbreak of this Sino-Japanese war, the French Concession has strictly adhered to its neutral stance in order to maintain order within its boundaries and prevent it from being disrupted by violence, which has greatly impressed all citizens. Not long ago, a minor dispute over the prohibition of flag display occurred in the French Concession. Now, the same incident has occurred again. We believe that everything is due to misunderstandings, but we feel that this misunderstanding is too serious.</p>
<p>The national flag represents the honor of a country. From the perspective of international etiquette, friendly countries should not interfere with the free display of national flags by their own people, no matter what. Although the Shanghai concessions are special areas, they are still Chinese territory. The Chinese people should be as free to display their national flags as the people of other countries within the concession. How can this be interfered with? Given the wisdom of the French Concession authorities, it is unlikely that they do not understand this simple principle. Perhaps they believe that they have been deeply oppressed by the so-called "special environment," and in order to maintain order within the concession, they have resorted to this inferior tactic in order to appease the special interests. We dare not fully believe this.</p>
<p>However, we must advise the French Concession authorities: Given the particularly close relationship between China and France in recent times, the French authorities certainly recognize that only the National Government of China is the sole legitimate government of China. Therefore, they should not prevent the Chinese people from displaying the only legal national flag that they respect, lest it leave a bad impression on the relations between the two countries. If they believe that they have to be mindful of the power of special interests, then they would be betraying the traditional French spirit of national chivalry and freedom. The French national character has always been known for suppressing the strong and helping the weak, and advocating chivalry. At the end of the 18th century, the United States resisted British violence. At that time, the British army was overwhelming, no different from China today. However, many French men of virtue and ambition, and many formal army and naval forces, selflessly helped the American Revolutionary War of Independence. Historians all admire this spirit of chivalry. The French government is now demonstrating this spirit, working to suppress the strong and help the weak in Europe, and helping countries such as Poland resist potential aggressors. Why don't the French Concession authorities adhere to their government's policies and treat the citizens within the concession accordingly?</p>
<p>Presumably, the French Concession authorities, due to the activities of terrorist groups in recent times, have also warned against Shanghai citizens displaying national flags, fearing that it would cause incidents and harm the safety of citizens, thus prohibiting flag display. However, the International Settlement also displayed national flags yesterday. Why didn't any activities that disturbed public order occur? Even if we take a step back and forgive the good intentions of the French Concession authorities, they should have issued a notice beforehand, explaining the reasons for not displaying flags, and appealing to sincerity, so that citizens would naturally not have any misunderstandings. Now that no announcement was made beforehand, the citizens within the concession displayed national flags during the day for promoting industry and commerce during National Spiritual Mobilization Week, expressing their enthusiasm for protecting their country. According to usual practice, this does not violate the concession's police regulations, and it is something that citizens should do. The police authorities suddenly forced the citizens to take down their national flags, and when carrying out their duties, they inevitably took rash and hasty actions. How could this not arouse the public anger of the citizens? Recalling that last year, the International Settlement authorities prohibited the Isolated Army Battalion from displaying the national flag, which ultimately led to bloodshed. Now, the Chinese people in the isolated island, embracing the spirit of the Isolated Army, are willing to shed blood to uphold their national flag many times over. If it is handled improperly, what incidents could be imagined? Fortunately, the citizens of the French Concession were able to restrain their grief and indignation yesterday, so only minor clashes occurred. This is worthy of our admiration, but restraint can only be effective for a short time, not for the long term. We hope that the wise authorities of the French Concession will learn from the past and give this matter serious consideration, seeking a solution that satisfies the citizens within the concession.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to advise the citizens in the concessions: in this extraordinary period, we hope that everyone will maintain the spirit of patience like yesterday and fight against the harsh environment. For the sake of justice, we will certainly not be willing to yield, but we must not cause major misfortunes due to misunderstandings. In the case of this incident, in addition to immediately lodging a protest with the French Concession authorities, the Shanghai public law organizations should immediately telegraph the central government, following diplomatic channels to lodge a formal protest with the French government, and demand that the same incident not occur again in the future. As for emotional disputes and rumored strikes, etc., these should be avoided as much as possible while waiting for a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army is in an Active Position, Strenuously Countering the Japanese Offensive, Continuously Counterattacking on a Broad Front, Japanese Soldiers Gradually Exhausted, New Troops Deployed for Battle</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to authoritative military observers, the Chinese strategy is currently to launch continuous counterattacks on a broad front, especially against the Japanese army's diverted or weak forces, launching surprise attacks to prevent the Japanese army from concentrating its forces on one or several points and carrying out its offensive to advance further, while at the same time making it unable to hold the strongholds it has already seized.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a Chinese spokesman, the Chinese army on the Hanshui front is currently attacking the Japanese army from the west and north, in order to prevent the Japanese army from sending reinforcements from the south. At the same time, the Chinese army in Suixian and other places east of the Hanshui River is currently advancing southeast towards the Pinghan Railway. Xinyang on this railway is already under a three-sided encirclement by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>It is also said that the Japanese are currently reinforcing Xinyang with 5,000 troops, mostly newly arrived from Japan, all around 21 years old, who have received no more than three months of military training. This shows that the Japanese army is gradually exhausting its sources of soldiers and has no soldiers to transfer, and can only conscript new soldiers who have not experienced military service. Currently, there are fierce battles every day southwest of Xinyang. In addition, several thousand new Japanese soldiers have arrived in the Yuezhou area, possibly in preparation for a Japanese offensive southward along the Yuehan Railway. At the same time, the Japanese army in the Gao'an area has also been transferred to the Wuning area.</p>
<p>According to intelligence reports, there is currently a German advisor and ten Japanese officers in the Dezhou area, studying the guerrilla activities of the Chinese army in that area and preparing to carry out their so-called "sweeping" campaign. According to news, Japan is currently planning to advance along the Longhai Railway. Thirty Japanese aircraft bombed Zhengzhou and Changzhi and Jincheng in Shanxi as a prelude to their attack. As for Suqian in northern Jiangsu, the Japanese are currently gathering a large army, with the aim of preventing the Chinese army from advancing to southern Shandong and endangering the Japanese army's rear. (19th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to announcements here from the Chinese side, the Japanese army has been in a state of panic since the Chinese army began its counter-offensive in central China, and has been continuously transporting troops and reinforcements to Hankou and Dongting Lake. The 20th Division, originally stationed in southern Shanxi, has also been transferred to central China. In addition, the Japanese army's offensive along the Hanshui River has been intercepted by the Chinese army, bringing it to a halt. (19th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>An Eurasia Aircraft Passenger Discusses</p>
<p>The Attack</p>
<p>Kaiyuan: Eurasia Aviation Corporation's No. 19 mail plane was attacked and forced to land by Japanese aircraft near Hekou on the 13th. Only one passenger, Li Quanmei, was on board. I visited Mr. Li tonight and he talked about the situation at the time with great emotion. Mr. Li is a businessman, 35 years old. He suffered minor injuries when the mail plane landed and is now gradually recovering. It is said that there were seven people on board in total, six of whom were Eurasia Company employees, including four Germans. The fact that all seven survived this incident was due to the German captain's calm handling of the situation and his excellent piloting skills. On that day, the mail plane was flying from Hanoi to Yunnan when it encountered three Japanese aircraft pursuing it at 3:15 p.m. Before long, it encountered another three Japanese aircraft, totaling six. Seeing this situation, the pilot immediately flew the mail plane into the clouds to hide. Thus, one side chased and the other side hid, for nearly an hour. The mail plane sometimes flew very high, but it was once attacked from above and below by six Japanese aircraft. The pilot finally used his exquisite piloting skills to escape the encirclement and forced the plane to land in a mountain valley in the high mountains, avoiding disaster. When I encountered the danger, I lay flat on the plane. My mood was very chaotic at the time, but the sound of the Japanese aircraft shooting at the mail plane could be clearly heard. [There were] several shots [hitting] the hull. After landing, the Japanese aircraft [continued] to drop eight bombs, fortunately, the hull only suffered minor damage and can still fly after repairs. The landing point was within the boundary of Maoping Town, only two li from the French Annam border. The pilot broke his ankle. Mr. Li also suffered several abrasions because he jumped out of the plane immediately after landing. After landing, he immediately tried to notify the Maoping Town authorities, who were ten miles from the landing site, and the authorities were able to come to the rescue in person within an hour, and sent people to escort [them] out of the country. The crew walked for three days and arrived at Fulin Station (transliterated, south of Lao Kai) in French Annam on the 16th. [They] experienced many hardships along the way. On one occasion, they only had eggs to eat, and [they] had to wade through a small stream that was knee-deep. After arriving at Fulin, I took a train to Yunnan and arrived in Kaiyuan tonight. The other seven crew members are still in Vietnam for treatment. (17th Dispatch) (Delayed)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly Battle Report —April 13th to 19th—</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that recently, on all fronts, our side has repeatedly achieved significant victories. The enemy is exhausted from running around and appears panicked and disoriented. Especially this week, the Northern and Southern battlefields have seen successive victories and significant gains. The amount of enemy killed and territory recovered has shaken both domestic and international audiences. This victorious trend is gradually unfolding, and the enemy's desperate attempts to resist have been completely crushed. Despite the enemy's continuous, reckless spreading of rumors and denial of defeat, facts speak louder than words, and discerning individuals can see the truth. The battle's progress is summarized below:</p>
<p>Guangdong Front</p>
<p>In Guangdong, our troops have been attacking the enemy fiercely with unstoppable momentum, making rapid progress. Since the morning of the 13th, troops from the East River divided into four routes to encircle Zengcheng. By noon, the strategic points of Zhuguling in the north of the city, Jiatouling in the west, and Pingfengling in the east were occupied by our forces. Additionally, troops were dispatched to cut off the enemy's communication line between the south of the city and Shitan, Guangzhou, defeating enemy reinforcements. By evening, the vanguard troops stormed into the city through the north and south gates. The enemy resisted fiercely, leading to intense street fighting. Around 2 AM the next morning, the remaining enemy was completely wiped out, and Zengcheng was officially recovered. Over 1,000 enemies were killed. In the past two days, leveraging the momentum of victory, they continued to advance towards Guangzhou. The sound of cannons can already be heard in Guangzhou. After recovering Huaxian in the North River, on the 16th, combined forces of various armies launched a brave attack, quickly recovering Southwest Town and pressing towards Guangzhou. As of yesterday afternoon, they were only twelve miles away from Guangzhou. In the West River, our troops approached Sanshui and Foshan on the 15th and 16th and are currently besieging them. The enemy's three major strongholds in Guangdong are Zengcheng in the East River, Huaxian in the North River, and Sanshui in the West River. The northeast two strongholds are now completely under our control. The traffic on the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Yuehan (Guangdong-Hankou), and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways is also completely under our control. The encirclement of Guangzhou is largely complete. In the areas of Xinhui and Jiangmen, Guifeng, Duruan, Jinggen, and other places have been successively captured. Jiangmen and Xinhui are ready to be attacked, posing a significant threat to the mouth of the West River. The enemy trapped in the isolated city of Guangzhou has had their retreat cut off and are now like turtles in a jar, extremely panicked and trying to flee.</p>
<p>Henan Front</p>
<p>The enemy in Henan Province has been under continuous general offensive by our forces this week, evolving into a major annihilation battle. In eastern Henan, our troops stormed into Kaifeng last Wednesday (11th) and Thursday (12th), wiping out over 2,000 enemies. The enemy's important base in the Central Plains has been occupied by our forces twice. This week, with renewed courage, they continued their fierce attack. On the evening of the 14th, our large force again approached the South Gate. The enemy dispatched over 2,000 reinforcements from the Longhai Railway, who disembarked at Zhangzhuang and were intercepted by our forces in the Nanditang area, leading to a fierce close-quarters battle. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, with piles of corpses. At the same time, another part of our army took advantage of the victory to capture Xuchang County, cutting off the Longhai Railway. The remaining enemy in Kaifeng has no way to retreat and is desperately holding on. Our troops besieging Xinyang in southern Henan have completely cleared out the remaining enemy on the southeast side of the city. This week, the enemy stubbornly resisted in the northwest suburbs of the city, launching fierce attacks westward from Zengshan, Shijiafan, and Zhujiafan, but were met with head-on blows, resulting in over 600 enemy deaths. The enemy fled in disarray. By noon on the 14th, after recovering Shijiafan and Zhujiafan, we took advantage of the situation to occupy Xianshan, three or four miles west of the city, forcing the remaining enemy to retreat into the city. Changhe Pass, the enemy's retreat route to the north, has also been surrounded by our forces. On the 14th and 15th, we stormed in from the north and south gates, capturing many enemies. The battles in both places are unfolding fiercely.</p>
<p>Hubei Front</p>
<p>The enemy troops in northern Hubei, in order to defend their strongholds of Yingshan and Anlu, launched several roundabout counterattacks towards our troops approaching the county towns on the 14th and 15th. After being intercepted separately in places like Haojiadian and Yujiadian, and after several days of fierce fighting, the enemy released poison gas unsuccessfully and completely collapsed on the morning of the 17th. After a determined pursuit, over a thousand enemies were killed. Both county towns are still under our siege. After Xiaojiadian, Xinji, and Yangzizhen, the strongholds around Zhongxiang in central Hubei, were recovered last week, the enemy troops in the city launched several counterattacks this week, but were all repelled, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. The remaining enemy, only about 600, can be completely wiped out soon. The enemy west of Yuekou, attempting to advance towards Heilu Ferry to reinforce Zhongxiang, was met with a sudden counterattack by our troops at dawn on the 17th. The enemy resisted stubbornly, leading to a bloody battle lasting two days and one night. By the evening of the 18th, the enemy was completely annihilated, with over a thousand infantry and over a hundred cavalry killed, and over a hundred horses and over ten light and heavy machine guns seized. We are now taking advantage of the victory to press towards Yuekou. At the same time, our troops who recovered Yuxin River attacked the outskirts of Tianmen on the afternoon of the 16th. The enemy is desperately defending the city, on the verge of collapse. Our large forces crossing the river have arrived in a steady stream. The enemy on the east bank of the Xiang River will have nowhere to be buried.</p>
<p>Shanxi Front</p>
<p>In southern Shanxi, our attacking troops have launched a large-scale mop-up operation against the remaining enemy near the suburbs of Xia County and Wenxi County for days, achieving great results. On the 15th, over a thousand enemies were dispatched from Anyun to reinforce Xia County, but were ambushed by our forces, resulting in over half of the enemy killed. The remaining enemy fled back the way they came. Another part of our army took advantage of the victory to occupy Yangshe, Podi, Guojiabao, and other key points southeast of Wenxi. The enemy abandoned over 700 bodies. The enemy stubbornly defending Zhangdian Town and Weiguo Town collapsed after fierce attacks on the 15th and 16th and fled north. Over two thousand enemies from Yicheng in eastern Shanxi attacked us on the morning of the 13th, but were cut into several sections using mobile tactics. The enemy fled in panic back into the city. We took advantage of the victory to follow closely. On the morning of the 14th, the enemy abandoned the city and fled towards Fushan, but were ambushed halfway, suffering heavy casualties. Yicheng and Fushan were thus recovered again. Another 3,000 enemies who invaded the east and west of Mochi via the Baijin Highway attempted to attack Yushe but were met with a brave counterattack. The enemy's momentum was greatly reduced, and the city was recovered on the 16th. In Lishi and Zhongyang in western Shanxi, our troops have been fighting fiercely this week, killing many enemies. The enemy's attempt to cross the river and attack westward has been suppressed and thwarted. The enemy in Jingle in northern Shanxi has been under siege for over ten days. This week, part of our army once stormed into the city. The enemy's strength has been greatly depleted. In addition, the enemy in northern Jiangxi has been under our general offensive this week. Wanshou Mountain, south of Nanchang, has fallen into our hands. We are now fiercely attacking the provincial capital. West of Wuning, our troops have wiped out the enemy troops in the suburbs, and the county town and suburbs are all within our sphere of influence. As for our troops counterattacking Gaoan, after once occupying the county town last week, they engaged in several battles for the suburban positions. The remaining enemy has been fleeing in disarray to Fengxin and Anyi. The enemy troops are extremely exhausted and unable to attack again.</p>
<p>Other Fronts</p>
<p>Our troops once recovered Bailing Temple in the Suiyuan area, killing nearly a thousand enemies. In the past few days, they have been attacking Guyang and Saxian with smooth progress. Yixing was recovered in Jiangnan, and Pixian and Haimen were recovered in northern Jiangsu. Hejian, Qingyun, Xinhua, and Nanhe were recovered in Hebei. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway was also further sabotaged with four large iron bridges blown up between Tai'an and Gushan (southwest of Jinan), completely controlling traffic on the entire line. All are becoming stronger and stronger, like autumn winds sweeping away fallen leaves, providing powerful proof of our belief that we will win the War of Resistance. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Su Bao's Commentary: The Domestic Situation in Japan - Open Conflict Within the Ruling Class</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A newspaper here recently published an article examining the proceedings of the 74th session of the Japanese Diet. It pointed out that this session exposed the open conflicts within the Japanese ruling class, reflecting their panic over the growing resentment of workers and farmers. All the difficulties of the invasion of China are borne by the working class and farmers. In the past, the Japanese people had developed a psychology that Japan's war against China was an "unresisted victory," but now the Japanese militarists themselves are advocating preparations for a "hundred-year war."</p>
<p>Increasing Difficulties in the War Against China. This new preparation for adventure has alarmed some members of the Japanese Diet. For example, Civil Administration Party member Nakayama said to the military, "Regarding the so-called preparation for a 'hundred-year war,' it is better to keep it in your heart and not publicize it openly in newspapers and magazines."</p>
<p>Low Wages and High Prices. What fruits the Japanese people have obtained from militarism can be proved by the working hours and wage figures published in Japanese newspapers. For example, if the Japanese workers' wage index was 100 in 1936, it had dropped to 85.3 in January 1939. At the same time, retail prices of goods continue to rise. For example, if it was 100 in 1932, it had increased to 142.7 by the end of February 1939. Regarding working hours, someone in the Diet claimed that the 12-hour workday system was an unattainable ideal.</p>
<p>Oppressing the People and Restricting Consumption. Regarding all necessities, Japan has implemented a special tax of 10% on the value. The Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry is stipulating a system of allocation cards for all general consumer goods on a per capita basis. The Minister of Finance declared in the Diet that he would "use force to compel the people to restrict consumption."</p>
<p>Small and Medium Industries Collapse One After Another. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 26,660 small and medium-sized industrialists in Japan have gone bankrupt. In the next two or three months, another 50,000 will suffer the same fate. This is due to a shortage of raw materials and a reduction in the production of non-war-related goods.</p>
<p>The Burden on Hundreds of Millions of People Increases Daily. An interesting fact was exposed in the Diet. It was claimed that the Japanese government does not bear the burial expenses of soldiers killed in battle. Therefore, the people have to pay a strange "death tax," which further increases the burden on families who have lost their breadwinners.</p>
<p>All of this has led to a growing resentment among the Japanese people, which Diet member Imai called "the resentment of the people towards officials (i.e., the government)." As a result, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma had to admit in the Diet that the current domestic situation is helping to fuel the rise of communist ideas. (19th TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>Chairman Lin's Condolences</p>
<p>To the Xie Family</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Lin sent a telegram of condolence to the family of National Government Committee Member Xie Huisheng. The original telegram reads: "To Madam Xie Dekan and Brother Shixiong at the Xie Residence in the Housheng Agricultural Farm in Chengdu, I was shocked to learn of Mr. Huisheng's death from the telegrams of comrades Jinfan and Jilu. I am deeply saddened by the fact that Mr. Xie dedicated himself to the Party and the country for more than 30 years, enduring prolonged illness and national disasters. The loss of an elder statesman is heartbreaking. However, his accomplishments will endure and remain immortal. I hope you will grieve with propriety, help with important matters, and comfort his spirit. This is my sincere hope. Lin Sen, with seal." (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>The Air Force in Shanxi</p>
<p>Unusually Active</p>
<p>Xingji In recent days, the brave Chinese Air Force has been unusually active in Shanxi Province. It bombed Houma and Taiyuan on the 8th, bombed Taigu on the 10th, attacked Taiyuan again on the 11th, and dropped many bombs in Yuci. At 2 PM on the 14th, a Chinese aircraft circled and scouted over Jiang County for twenty minutes before leisurely flying west. (19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Reports: The United States Will Send a Note to Japan Proposing a Solution to the Sino-Japanese Problem; Japan's Established Policy is Not to Accept</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo, 19th Dispatch, The Asahi Shimbun reports that it is rumored that US President Roosevelt will submit a note to Japan at the end of April, the content of which is roughly the same as the recent telegram to Germany and Italy, stating that if Japan wants to convene an international conference to solve the Far East problem, the United States is willing to support it. It is said that the United Kingdom and the United States have reached an understanding on naval affairs. The British navy is concentrated in the Mediterranean, and the majority of the US navy is moving to the Pacific. Therefore, the United States is very likely to propose a solution to the Sino-Japanese incident to Japan. However, if the US president does take this measure, Japan will definitely reject it. According to the Japanese government's repeated declarations, it is sufficient to show that Japan believes that the method of convening an international conference is neither effective nor appropriate to stabilize the East Asian situation in the process of establishing a "new order." This morning, foreign reporters inquired about the matters reported in the Asahi Shimbun to the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the reply was that the matters reported were nothing but the reporters' speculation. Regarding the US President's telegram to Germany and Italy, the Japanese spokesperson declined to comment. A reporter asked how Japan feels about the gradual concentration of the US fleet in the Pacific. The Japanese spokesperson said that Japan does not pay attention to this matter. The entry of the US Navy into the Pacific is only a matter of returning to its original defense. (19th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Britain Strengthens the Strength of the Far East Fleet by Replacing Old Ships with Larger New Ships - The Anti-Aggression Alliance Will Include China</h3>
<p>(London) The British cruiser Cardiff of 4,290 tons, stationed in Chinese waters, has been in service for 22 years. The Admiralty has now announced that this ship will be recalled at the end of this month and replaced with a larger cruiser. This has aroused great interest in naval circles and those concerned about the Far East. Some predict that the newly tested and fully equipped 10,000-ton cruiser Edinburgh will be sent to China. Although this news has not been confirmed, Reuters is sure that the replacement for Cardiff will be a 10,000-ton cruiser. Another large cruiser, Cornwall, is currently en route to China. At the same time, two old ships of the East India Fleet have now been recalled and replaced with two new ships, Manchester and Liverpool. Another, Gloucester, is also en route to East India to replace the flagship Norfolk. Because the United Kingdom is restricted by the Washington Naval Treaty, it has been unable to restore the strength of its fleet stationed in China to its pre-European War levels. However, new warships are now being completed one after another, so old ships will be gradually replaced to enhance Britain's naval position in the Far East. According to experts, in the event of an incident, the five new cruisers currently sailing to the Far East can be combined to form a fleet of equal strength. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to today's diplomatic observers, the fact that Roosevelt suddenly summoned the US fleet back to the Pacific is sufficient to clarify the current international situation and the proximity of a world war. It is said that this decision was made by President Roosevelt personally, and the generals of the ships were unaware of it beforehand. Informally, it is generally believed that this move is a strategy to deal with Japan, or an indication of a tacit understanding between the United Kingdom and the United States. (19th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Today, Labour Party member Henderson asked in the House of Commons whether the government had decided that China and other Far Eastern countries needed to join the anti-aggression alliance. Chamberlain replied that the United Kingdom was very willing to consider this issue. (19th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that when British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Dr. Guo Taiqi spoke at the Foreign Office on Tuesday, the extension of the anti-aggression front to the Far East was mentioned for the first time. Today, Labour Party member Hantson will say to Chamberlain in the House of Commons, 'Has the government ever decided to make China or other Far Eastern countries participate in the anti-aggression front?' Hantson told an Associated Press reporter that since one end of the anti-communist axis is in East Asia, the new collective security system must include both the East and Europe to be effective. I do not intend to exclude Japan from this front, nor do I intend to encircle Japan. If Japan can adopt a non-aggressive policy, I welcome Japan's participation. Diplomats interviewed by the Associated Press believe that if the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are the second stage in establishing an anti-aggression front, then the participation of China and other Asian countries in the anti-aggression front is the third stage. However, the return of the US fleet to the Pacific is regarded here as a signal to contain aggression in the eastern hemisphere. Even Chinese people here only hope that Britain will provide China with further financial assistance and reduce or stop British trade with Japan. (18th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Sixty Percent of the World's Gold</p>
<p>Is Concentrated in the United States</p>
<p>Roosevelt Convenes a Meeting of Financial Experts</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt met with financial experts in the government yesterday, such as Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, to discuss how to protect the US Treasury and its economic institutions under the threat of a European war. The reason for convening this meeting is that in the past four weeks, gold flowing into the United States from Europe is estimated to be around $500,000,000, suddenly bringing the gold stored in the US Treasury to $15,500,000,000, or 60 percent of the world's gold. The government not only expressed that the concentration of gold in the United States should be dealt with, but the president also attempted to protect the US securities and foreign exchange markets during this period of tense European situation. Those who consulted with the President today included Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Agriculture Secretary Wallace, Federal Reserve Chairman Eccles, Securities and Exchange Commissioners Hanles and Frank.

<p>Roosevelt's Great Move</p>
<p>Britain is Very Moved</p>
<p>The Cabinet Discusses National Defense</p>
<p>(London) Reuters' House of Commons correspondent said that when Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned President Roosevelt in the House of Commons today, the whole house cheered, showing that the members of the House were satisfied with the US President's telegram calling for peace. Members occasionally asked the Prime Minister about Anglo-American cooperation to seek European peace, but the wording was cautious, and they were quite concerned about US policy. Today, the members discussed the US President's actions in more detail and were more excited than before. The general opinion is that the US President showed his courage at the right time. It can be seen that the US President's actions have had a calming effect on the British Parliament. All parties praised the US President's actions, but no one had extravagant hopes for the results of the US President's move. (18th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters' Parliamentary correspondent has learned that the issue of implementing conscription in the United Kingdom is one of the important aspects of national defense. The Cabinet may consider this at its weekly meeting today. In addition, there are other matters to be considered: (1) The establishment of the Ministry of Military Supplies and the selection of ministers, (2) The reduction of reserved tasks in national service, in order to encourage the recruitment of national defense volunteers, (3) The compulsory implementation of non-military physical education for young people nationwide. According to Reuters' correspondent, conscription is still regarded as unlikely to be implemented in the United Kingdom, but the opinions on the necessity of this system at home and abroad are currently being carefully studied. Secretary of War Perry-Xia had a long meeting with Prime Minister Chamberlain yesterday. It is reported that Perry-Xia strongly supports the establishment of a Ministry of Military Supplies, or a similar agency, to assist national defense and supply the equipment necessary for the expanded British army. Now the number of national defense volunteers has doubled, so this issue is becoming increasingly acute. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that the Cabinet decided to establish a Ministry of Military Supplies at its meeting this morning. The candidates for the Minister of the Ministry include Morrison, the Minister for Lancaster County Affairs, and Lord Weir, the former advisor to the Aviation Department, but they have not yet been finalized.

<h3>American Cruiser Visits Malta, Part of German Fleet Departs for Naval Exercises off the Coast of Spain</h3>
<p>Malta: It was announced here today that the American cruiser "Omaha" is scheduled to visit Malta from April 25th to May 2nd. Naval officials declined to comment on the significance of the American ship's visit to the British naval base. Observers pointed out that the American ship's visit to Malta coincides with the German Reichstag meeting (April 28th), which is particularly noteworthy. It is reported that Hitler will deliver a speech in the Reichstag on April 28th in response to Roosevelt's peace appeal (April 19th, Associated Press).</p>
<p>(Berlin) Twenty-five German warships and several auxiliary vessels, which will conduct exercises off the coast of Spain, have begun concentrating off Schillig Roads today. Battleships and submarines left the Kiel naval port at night, while the rest departed from Wilhelmshaven this morning. According to official announcements, the German ships will be at sea for a month. The exercise area is in the Atlantic Ocean west of Spain. According to unofficial sources today, the German fleet's final destination will be an Italian port. It is rumored that they will visit Lisbon around April 28th. The German official schedule for the fleet voyage, from April 27th to May 19th, includes seven Spanish ports, as well as Ceuta, Tangier in Africa, and Lisbon. (April 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Forty German warships, including twenty-eight combat vessels, sailed yesterday for the waters off Spain, Portugal, and Spanish Morocco. The German government issued a public statement at the time of the navy's departure, declaring that this action had no military significance. However, in reality, it is of great military importance, as the German navy can join with the Italian Mediterranean fleet. Although the British and French fleets in the Mediterranean are superior in large ships, they are inferior to the combined German-Italian fleet in smaller vessels. The respective strengths in the Mediterranean can be compared as follows: British ships are currently concentrated in Malta, while French ships are concentrated in Gibraltar. Simultaneously, a combined British-French fleet of one hundred and fifty ships is patrolling the Strait of Tangier at the entrance to the Mediterranean to prevent any unforeseen events. (April 19th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Tangier: Today, large numbers of new Moroccan troops arrived in Ceuta and Melilla in Spanish Morocco from Cadiz, Adargón, and Algeciras in Spain, further increasing the panic here. According to observers' calculations, there are currently 60,000 Moroccan troops concentrated in Spanish Morocco, compared to the usual peacetime force of approximately 30,000 troops. Furthermore, as Muslims are scheduled to celebrate "Eid al-Adha" on May 1st and 3rd, there are deep fears here that dissidents will take the opportunity to cause trouble, providing a pretext for totalitarian states to take interventionist actions. It is also reported that Moroccan troops have been spotted near Bougtaï, on the border of the Tangier International Zone. The area is undefended and is a key point on the road between Tangier and Tetouan. (April 18th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(London) The Spanish High Commissioner to the International Neutral Zone of Tangier has provided firm assurances to the British Consul that Spain has no intention of threatening the port and that there are no troop or warship movements. Rumors that Spain intends to attack the port are entirely unfounded. Furthermore, the Portuguese government is said to have notified the British government that there are no Italian troop movements on the Portuguese-Spanish border and that rumors of Portugal being under threat of attack are baseless. Well-informed sources here recently stated that the British Admiralty is no longer as pessimistic about the situation in the western Mediterranean as it once was, and that the German fleet's voyage to patrol off the coast of Spain does not pose a serious threat.

<p>South Africa</p>
<p>Eight Thousand Germans Residing,</p>
<p>Mostly Armed</p>
<p>Windhoek, South Africa: Territorial Council member, Mr. Theron told a Reuters reporter today, regarding sending reinforcements to South-West Africa yesterday, that there are eight thousand Germans in South-West Africa, most of whom are armed and organized. Given the current situation, they may act irresponsibly. Although any such uprising or attempt to sabotage will inevitably fail, lives will be lost and significant damage will be caused. In any case, prevention is better than cure. The police reinforcements dispatched from Johannesburg and Bloemfontein yesterday will arrive here tomorrow. At the same time, police from various stations in South-West Africa are currently concentrating here. The authorities have hastily prepared accommodation. Windhoek is the capital of South-West Africa. (April 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Cape Town: At a financial meeting today, South African statesman General Smuts, while proposing a motion to incorporate the South-West African police into the South African police, declared: "Austria's annexation was justified by its failure to maintain law and order. The same cannot be said of the South African Union government. The government will continue to fulfill its responsibility for administering the mandated territory until that responsibility is relinquished. Given the seriousness of the information received by the government in the past week, public opinion may deem the number of troops dispatched to the mandated territory to be insufficient. However, it is hoped that the steps taken will achieve the desired effect, and that no movement will arise in the territory that undermines good order." Smuts also pointed out that the police force in South-West Africa is extremely limited, with only 240 police officers scattered throughout the territory, and that it is necessary to concentrate the police in areas where disturbances are likely to occur. Smuts concluded by saying that the police movements have no military significance. (April 19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Ambassador Guo's Speech</p>
<p>China's Resistance War</p>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi, in a speech at a banquet hosted by the North American Club, stated that he was pleased that U.S. President Roosevelt's remarks regarding events in Asia were as resolute and practical as when addressing European issues. Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, China is fighting for international justice and for the democratic system of all nations. China has been sustaining the war almost entirely on its own strength for twenty-one months now. It is not only fighting for its own country, but also forcing the partners in the aggressor camp in Asia to become mired in our country's quagmire, which is beneficial to all democratic countries in the world.

<h3>Japanese Newspapers Speculate,</h3>
<h3>That Roosevelt Favors Japan,</h3>
<h3>Requesting to Send the Same Telegrams to German and Italian Leaders,</h3>
<h3>The Japanese Foreign Ministry Considers it Speculation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Asahi Shimbun reports that U.S. President Roosevelt intends to send a telegram in his own name to the Japanese government, similar to the letters sent to Hitler and Mussolini. President Roosevelt may announce that the United States is willing to actively mediate and convene a conference of nations with interests in the Far East to find a solution to the current situation in East Asia, but only after Japan agrees. The newspaper further predicted that President Roosevelt will send this telegram after the American ship Astoria, carrying the ashes of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito, departs from Yokohama. The newspaper also stated that Japanese authorities have already discussed Japan's response. Japan will: (1) agree with the German and Italian replies to the U.S., which are expected to reject President Roosevelt's appeal; (2) maintain the position that a Far East conference is not an effective or appropriate way to handle the situation, and Japan will refuse to agree to convene such a conference. (April 19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared today that the report in the Asahi Shimbun that President Roosevelt seems to be sending a telegram to Japan in his own name is purely speculation. (April 19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, in response to a question from a foreign reporter today, said, "Japan does not believe that the U.S. fleet's transfer to the Pacific is of much significance, as it is merely the fleet returning to its original base." When another reporter asked if the Japanese government had received information regarding the exchange of goods between China and Germany, the spokesman replied that he had not heard anything about it.

<h3>More Than Fourteen Hundred Suicides in Tokyo</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to statistics from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, there were 1,498 suicides and 386 attempted suicides in Tokyo in 1938, totaling 1,884 people, including 1,143 men and 741 women. (April 19th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Munitions Statistics,</h3>
<h3>Overall Greatly Reduced,</h3>
<h3>But Kerosene Still Increasing</h3>
<p>According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, the United States exports of munitions to Japan, there are fourteen categories, and the quantity and value are more than in the past, the last six months, from August 1938 to January 1939, the total value is US$98,744,526, and from August 1937 to January 1938, the total was only US$81,037,757, here is a comparison table:</p>
<p>The above fourteen categories total US$98,744,526 US$81,07,757 According to the total US exports to Japan, from August 1938 to January 1939, the last six months, not more than US$116,000,000, and military supplies accounted for more than 85% of the total.</p>
<p>In addition, according to news from various places on the west coast, the amount of American kerosene shipped to Japan is still increasing rapidly, for example, from March 13th to 26th in the port of Los Angeles, a total of 3,440,000 barrels of kerosene were shipped to Japan in two weeks, and in the week ending April 1st, another 1,833,000 barrels were shipped. In total, 5,541,864 barrels of kerosene were shipped to Japan in March, and the number in April may be more than this. (April Havas Air Communication)</p>

<h3>French Liner Paris,</h3>
<h3>Caught Fire and Sank at Night,</h3>
<h3>Suspected of Sabotage,</h3>
<h3>Prior Warning Received</h3>
<p>Le Havre: The 34,000-ton giant ship Paris, which caught fire last night, sank today despite the best efforts of the fire brigade. It is currently impossible to determine whether the fire was accidental or due to sabotage. Local authorities have begun an investigation. According to a director of the shipping company, Margraiff, speaking in London, the burning of the ship is highly suspicious of sabotage, and as a precaution against possible accidents, the ship was specially guarded at the Le Havre dock. The Paris was one of France's finest luxury liners, capable of carrying over 3,000 passengers. (April 19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Le Havre: The French Atlantic Shipping Company's "Paris" liner, with a displacement of 34,000 tons, is the company's third largest liner. It was docked in this port and caught fire suddenly last night. Despite strenuous efforts to extinguish the fire, the fire was too fierce and it sank before noon today. The fire chief fell into the cargo hold and died on the spot. Several firefighters were also burned. (April 19th, Havas)</p>
<p>Le Havre: The French Shipping Company's "Paris" liner, docked in this port, suddenly caught fire from the kitchen at 10:30 last night. The fire was extremely fierce. After the fire brigade worked hard to put it out, it was extinguished this morning. The ship was badly damaged. The previous report of sinking is inaccurate. All passengers and crew are safe and sound. However, the fire chief and a firefighter unfortunately died in the line of duty. The ship was carrying ten aircraft shipped from the United States, as well as gold and jewelry worth 75 million francs, which were not affected. In addition, there were many antiques and famous oil paintings from the Louvre Museum that were intended for display at the New York World's Fair, all of which were priceless treasures. They were originally scheduled to be shipped to the United States on this ship, but fortunately, they were all stored on the dock, avoiding the disaster. However, in the hasty confusion, a wooden box containing two antique bottles and many ancient books suddenly went missing and could not be found. The shipping minister, Shaplan, and the police authorities have departed from Paris to investigate the truth about the fire. Local officials here declared that it is difficult to say at this time whether this was an accident or a conspiracy. According to the Paris evening newspaper, this was negligence caused by arson. Rumor has it that the police authorities had notified the French Shipping Company a few days ago, saying that according to confidential reports, someone was attempting to harm the company's Normandy and Paris liners. The company then took various precautions. Last night, a sailor was arrested by the night patrol while sneaking into the cabin from a window in the dark. Five chefs were also questioned by the police, and the police closed the kitchen at 6:00 p.m. It is said that someone used a counterfeit key to open the door and placed an incendiary bomb, resulting in this disaster. However, it is also said that it was caused by a short circuit in the electrical wiring. Which is true must be determined after the investigation is completed. The Paris has been operating on the Atlantic route between New York and Le Havre since 1921. It is 233 meters long, 26 meters wide, has 46,000 horsepower, a speed of 22 knots per hour, and can accommodate 3,233 passengers and 700 crew members. (April 19th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Hitler Returns to Berlin,</h3>
<h3>Presides Over Diplomatic Activities,</h3>
<h3>Receives Romanian Foreign Minister,</h3>
<h3>Appoints Papen as Ambassador to Turkey</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Since Hitler returned to Berlin from Austria, Germany once again took the diplomatic initiative in Europe yesterday. In order to achieve diplomatic efforts and curb the containment policy of Britain and France, Germany intends to contact Romania, Hungary, and Turkey, so that they also attach themselves to the Rome-Berlin Axis, in order to expand its sphere of influence. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here last night from Bucharest and immediately conferred with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. It is said that the German Foreign Minister still insists that Romania must explicitly state whether it intends to join the British-French anti-aggression camp. At the same time, Hitler appointed former envoy to Vienna, Papen, as the German ambassador to Turkey. It is reported that this action was taken on Ribbentrop's advice and is another way to curb the containment policy of Britain and France. Papen is one of the most capable people at diplomatic boundaries. It is expected that his goal is to overturn the current military alliance negotiations between Britain and Turkey. Before arriving in Berlin, Gafencu had a brief discussion with Polish Foreign Minister Beck in Warsaw. It is rumored that the two countries have agreed that Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia should not enter into any defense agreement with the Soviet Union. According to the Polish side, this decision is entirely based on the "arrival of the Red Army in our country is as dangerous as an attack by German troops." It is also reported that Poland and Romania will refuse to recognize the British-Soviet military alliance. If the seriousness of this report is confirmed, then Soviet troops will not be able to directly open from the east and attack Germany. However, these developments should not have any impact on the air force agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Air Minister Goering is expected to arrive here from Rome today to confer with Hitler. It is said that Goering also carries with him Mussolini's decision on the reply to President Roosevelt's peace proposal. (April 18th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu paid tribute to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at 11 o'clock this morning and laid a wreath. At noon, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, he went to the Chancellery to meet with Führer Hitler and then had lunch with the Foreign Minister and held talks. (April 19th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held a banquet this evening to welcome Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and gave a welcoming speech, saying, "Your Excellency's visit will not only promote friendship between our two countries, but also greatly contribute to our joint efforts to improve the situation." Foreign Minister Gafencu immediately stood up and responded, praising the recently concluded supplementary commercial agreement between Germany and Romania, and said that this agreement will definitely have a positive impact on the relations between the two countries. (April 18th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Diplomatic circles here have learned that the German government has appointed former Prime Minister Papen as ambassador to Turkey, and are paying great attention to it. Papen served as the chief of staff of the Turkish Fourth Army during the European War. This decision to send an envoy to Turkey is Germany's last effort to win over Turkey and attempt to prevent Turkey from getting too close to Britain and France. However, officials here believe that Britain and France's invitation to Turkey to join the collective security organization is being negotiated and there is complete confidence of success. According to foreign sources, the Turkish and Greek General Staffs have already signed a cooperation agreement, stipulating that in the event of war in the future, the fleets of both sides will be commanded by the Greek Navy Commander, and the Greek army will be commanded by the Turkish Army Commander.

<h3>Will Danzig's Status Change Soon? Perhaps as a Birthday Gift for Hitler?</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Butler declared in the House of Commons today that the League of Nations Council should consider any revision of Danzig's status. He also said that Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent remarks in the House of Commons have left no doubt about the British government's guarantee to Poland. (April 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Liberal MP Mander asked, "Regarding the organization of a collective security system, do the agreements we are drafting with other countries stipulate mutual restraint, and will we allow all countries, including Germany, to sign and join?" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "Regarding this matter, the government is exchanging views with other related governments. I have already explained this in my reply to Lord Adley yesterday, and there is nothing else I can tell you at this time." (April 19th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Arab Muslims,</h3>
<h3>Anti-Italian Sentiment High,</h3>
<h3>Urging Reconciliation with Jews,</h3>
<h3>Saying Mussolini Broke His Word</h3>
<p>(London) Many reports from Muslim countries in the Mediterranean region prove that Italy's annexation of Albania has aroused strong anger among Muslims. Syria, Iraq, and Palestine have expressed much resentment. Former Syrian Prime Minister Madamm recently stated that Italy's seizure of Albania will inevitably have a serious reaction in Arab Muslim public opinion. News from all sides has proven this to be true. Iraqi newspapers have unanimously expressed public outrage at the demise of Albania and have ridiculed Mussolini, who previously styled himself as a protector of Arab Muslims, contradicting himself. A Palestinian newspaper yesterday published a signed letter from an Arab celebrity, appealing to the Arabs and Jews of Palestine to dispel old grievances and jointly deal with the threat of dictatorial powers, saying that those who hoped that Mussolini would free them from their shackles can now see the truth. He believes that the Arabs who regarded the Rome-Berlin Axis as a way for them to be saved should no longer blindly follow it. This letter has attracted much attention. (April 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although officials do not recognize the rumor that Germany is negotiating with Poland to peacefully return Danzig to Germany as a birthday gift for Hitler, there are many who believe it. (April 18th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Authorities,</h3>
<h3>Talk with Italy</h3>
<p>(Rome) Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky came here to hold talks with the Italian authorities, but no results have been achieved. It is learned that Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to go to the port of Venice on the 22nd of this month to hold talks with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković in order to reconcile Hungary and Yugoslavia. According to well-informed sources, the talks between Italy and Hungary are very harmonious. (April 19th, Havas)</p>
<h3>England and Russia Sign Military Alliance; Poland Still Has Objections; Russian Ambassador to England Returns Home for Instructions; Romanian Foreign Minister to Visit England</h3>
<p>Warsaw - Foreign Minister Beck met with British Ambassador Sir Kennard today. Polish officials have taken a highly reserved attitude towards the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, specifically the invitation for the Soviet Union to join the collective security organization. They stated that these negotiations are unrelated to the mutual assistance agreement negotiated between Britain and Poland. The Polish government has not yet decided what stance it will take when Britain and the Soviet Union reach an agreement in the future. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - Today, the Soviet Ambassador to England, Maisky, arrived here on his way back to his country. He denied carrying any concrete proposals from Britain, stating that his trip was purely to report on the European situation after being summoned back home. He added that it is not yet known how long he will stay in Moscow, which will depend on the development of the European situation, but it is unrelated to Hitler's speech in Parliament. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) - Diplomatic circles here recently stated that Britain is negotiating with the Soviet Union with two goals in mind: 1. To encourage the Soviet Union to guarantee its neighboring countries, namely Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania (note: Lithuania does not border the Soviet Union); 2. Mutual guarantees between Britain and the Soviet Union. The details of this matter are extremely complex, and it is uncertain whether an agreement can be reached before German leader Hitler's speech on the 28th of this month. However, based on the progress of the negotiations, there is sufficient reason to believe that a satisfactory outcome will be achieved. Regarding the first point, the return of Soviet Ambassador Maisky should contribute to its progress. It is reported that the Soviet Union has, in principle, accepted the idea of guaranteeing the security of Romania, but the specific details have not yet been resolved. The British government intends for the Soviet Union to declare, in general terms, that it will provide assistance under certain conditions when requested by Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The "certain conditions" are not explicitly stated, to avoid Germany using this as an excuse to accuse the countries of pursuing an encirclement policy. Therefore, the wording is deliberately vague. In essence, the guarantee that the Soviet Union should provide is neither mutual automatic assistance nor unilateral automatic assistance. It is only when the aforementioned countries are invaded and request assistance from the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union will deploy its modern army to respond. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) - Well-informed sources here recently stated that regarding Turkey's participation in the collective security organization, representatives of Britain and Turkey have signed an agreement in the Turkish capital. However, out of respect for the Turkish government's opinion, it will not be made public for the time being. The significance of this agreement leans heavily towards military aspects, and it contains various technical clauses, such as stipulating that British warships have free passage through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits of Turkey. Premature disclosure before the completion of negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union would be inconvenient. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Diplomatic circles here recently stated that the goal of negotiations between Britain, France, and Turkey is to establish a collective security system in the eastern Mediterranean, with Turkey playing a key role. There are three main measures: 1. Turkey should provide its naval bases for use by the British fleet and guarantee that British and French warships have free passage through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits. In other words, to guarantee the transportation lines between Britain and France and the Soviet Union and Romania. 2. Turkey, as a military power in the Islamic world, must assist Britain and France in defending the Arab countries. 3. Turkey should promote a closer alliance among the Balkan Entente countries (Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey). Regarding the first point, since Britain provided a guarantee to Greece, Italy's invasion of Albania has caused unrest in southeastern Europe, which is now gradually stabilizing. In light of this, Turkey has decided to willingly assist the British fleet in exchange for Britain's guarantee. Regarding the second point, Turkey can assist Britain in strengthening its position in Palestine. Regarding the third point, the Turkish army is known for its elite status, and in the event of war, it would undoubtedly constitute an important factor in the Balkans, valued by the other countries of the Balkan Entente. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) - Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is scheduled to arrive in London before April 22 for a three- to four-day official visit. The details of the discussions between British officials and Gafencu have not yet been finalized. Gafencu arrived in Berlin today and will discuss matters with German officials for two days before traveling to London via Brussels. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Progress of the Czechoslovak Restoration Movement; Benes Appointed Leader</h3>
<p>Chicago - Former Czech President Benes announced yesterday that he has agreed to serve as the leader of the two million Czechs living outside Czechoslovakia. He is currently working to establish a new Czechoslovak Republic. Comrades in London, Paris, and Moscow will likely issue a declaration urging all Czechs to begin a "new political action." He strongly agrees with this point. The so-called "action" refers to the Czechs joining the European anti-aggression front. Benes also stated that he is currently attempting to organize a "Czech National Council." (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Slight Improvement in the European Situation</h3>
<p>(London) - Diplomatic circles here recently stated that the international situation seems to have slightly improved. The following points can be made: 1. If Germany and Italy take further action, it will inevitably lead to a major war. Leaders Hitler and Mussolini are well aware of this. 2. The diplomatic efforts made by Britain and France to form a peace front have been supported by the United States. 3. After the democratic countries strengthened their defenses, the totalitarian countries no longer have the hope of a quick victory. Germany and Italy both lack food and raw materials and cannot sustain a long-term war. 4. During the tense situation over the Czech issue last September, all ships of German shipping companies were recalled. This is not the case at present, and scheduled slots are still being honored. 5. The claim that Germany will immediately annex the Free City of Danzig has been denied by Berlin. 6. Although the Spanish Civil War has ended, the wounds have not healed, and food is also scarce. It is unlikely to participate in the war. If it only provides its ports for use by the German and Italian navies, the British and French navies would immediately blockade them and take military action against the country. As for the German naval fleet patrolling in Spanish waters, in the event of war, it would certainly threaten the Atlantic transportation lines of Britain and France. However, Britain and France have already taken various preventive measures to offset this. Some in British political circles even said that Germany's dispatch of a distant fleet is only intended to demonstrate its power to the democratic countries and Spain. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>If War Breaks Out in Europe, Japan May Not Immediately Attack Hong Kong; Japanese Reporter Warns Japan That the United States Will Immediately Join the War if Japan Attacks Hong Kong</h3>
<p>A Hong Kong dispatch from the China Mail on the 14th states: Residents here, both Chinese and foreign, are now worried that if war breaks out in Europe, the security of Hong Kong may be affected. However, foreigners outwardly remain calm. The authorities have already begun air raid preparations. Chinese newspapers frequently publish plans to move residents of Victoria to the New Territories across the harbor. Wealthy Chinese refugees, having experienced aerial attacks in Guangzhou and other places, are particularly concerned that Hong Kong will be subjected to this misfortune again. According to observers here, even if Britain goes to war with Germany or Italy, it is not certain that Japan will join the Axis powers, nor is it certain that Japan will attack Hong Kong, because Japan is currently engaged in a war in China. One observer quoted a statement from a seasoned Japanese reporter for the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun. This reporter issued a warning from Washington last September, stating that if Japan attacks Hong Kong, the United States will almost certainly immediately join the war. This reporter is currently in Japan and recently published an article in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, stating that the United States will not fight China and Japan, but if Japan attempts to occupy Hong Kong in a world war, it will definitely go to war with Japan. Therefore, the situation in Hong Kong may not be as dangerous as many pessimists believe.</p>
<p>A Jinhua dispatch reports that the Japanese army has been sending planes to bomb the counties along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, including Shangrao, Yushan, Quzhou, and Jiangshan, causing widespread devastation to the people. On the morning of April 8, Japanese planes attacked Jinhua in two waves, bombing the bustling commercial areas, cultural institutions, and civilian residences, including more than 20 locations such as the front of the courthouse, Sipailou Street, and the Sanqing Primary School and the attached elementary school of Jinhua Middle School. The extent of the devastation, the number of casualties, and the amount of damage were unprecedented. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The first bombing occurred at 9:15 a.m. on April 8, when three Japanese planes arrived from Hangzhou. Ten minutes later, the Japanese planes had flown over the urban area of Jinhua and, without circling, directly bombed the bustling areas of the city, dropping more than 30 bombs and strafing with machine guns. The sounds of explosions and black smoke filled the air, and many civilians were killed or injured. A fire broke out in Sipailou after being hit by incendiary bombs. The Japanese planes dropped two more bombs on the outskirts of the city and then fled towards Pujiang. Within about 20 minutes, a Japanese plane once again infiltrated the city's airspace. Fires broke out successively where the bombs landed, and the fires were very intense. Unfortunately, there was a lack of water, making rescue difficult. Fortunately, the fire brigade from Fangyan rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and worked hard to put out the fires. The fires were gradually extinguished after 3 p.m. The shops burned down in the Sipailou area included, on the right side, starting from Zhang Xinjie barbershop next to the World Bookstore, Lu Xiangtai grocery store, Mao Hengtai tin shop, Chuan Zhaocheng pen shop, Longhao New Hotel, Shiguang Clock Shop, Yuan Taiyu Tea Shop, Hua Xing Leather Shoe Store, Ronghua Dyeing Shop, Yongshunxiang Western Clothing Store, Modern Stationery Store, and Huacheng Medal Company. On the left side, starting from Bao Yitai foreign goods shop next to Baohe Western Clothing Store, Bu Ao Zhai pen shop, Fu Da Heng tea shop, Langtao Stationery Store, Huisheng Tang pharmacy, Wuweihe tea shop, Da Jixiang rice cake shop, Taichang leather shoe store, Shanghai Magazine Company and dozens of other shops were completely burned down. The Dagong Consumer Cooperative, Meizuishi shoe store, and Mengsheng pen shop also had most of their buildings destroyed, resulting in significant losses. Lu Lao San, the owner of Lu Xiangtai, who was over 60 years old, was unable to escape and was crushed to death. Two Shaoxing merchants who were setting up foreign goods stalls near the shop also took refuge inside the building during the air raid and were crushed to death. Coffins have already been prepared for them. The area is the most prosperous commercial district in Jinhua, and it has now been turned into a field of rubble by the Japanese planes. According to an investigation, more than 60 bombs were dropped, including two incendiary bombs. More than 150 men and women civilians have been confirmed dead or injured. Those who have not been excavated or who have sustained minor injuries and sought medical attention or bandaged themselves have not yet been counted. Approximately 200 houses were burned, bombed, or damaged by shockwaves. Among the injured civilians, 51 were sent to the Injured People's Hospital, 40 were sent to the Security Military Hospital, and 16 were sent to the Gospel Hospital. More than 60 men and women were killed on the spot. When reporters went to the disaster areas to investigate, families were preparing coffins for their relatives, wailing in grief. The bodies of those who were not claimed were still lying there, with incomplete limbs and exposed internal organs. The atrocities of the Japanese planes can be described as heinous. The county's Air Raid Emergency Relief Joint Office held an emergency meeting and decided to notify the victims of the disaster to register at the Jinhua Refugee General Station and to designate a location for shelter. The expenses will be temporarily paid by the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Association and reimbursed by the Relief Association. Representatives from various agencies will be sent to the hospitals to express condolences to the injured.</p>
<p>Guerrilla warfare unfolds between Jiangsu and Shandong; Chinese troops arrive and launch a pincer attack on Japanese troops; fierce fighting in the Yishui and Zhucheng areas</p>
<p>A dispatch from Taixian reports that guerrilla warfare has now broken out in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong. The main force of the Chinese army has also arrived and is jointly launching a pincer attack on the Japanese army in Huaihai with the various large armies and self-defense forces on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong. They are also protecting armed civilians, destroying the Longhai Railway and the Zheng-Hai, Huai-Hai, and Huai-Xu highways section by section. The cities and transportation lines occupied by the Japanese army have been cut off by the Chinese army, making it impossible for them to coordinate. The Japanese army in Lianghuai is in a state of panic under the encirclement and surveillance of the Chinese army and has transported heavy weapons to Lianshui, showing signs of retreat.</p>
<p>The Japanese army along the Jiaoji Railway in southern Shandong has gradually increased since late March. Starting on the first of this month, more than 600 Japanese soldiers with six cannons, who had invaded south from Linyi, fled to the vicinity of Xinzhuang. A certain unit of the Chinese army advanced to the area north of Mazhan in Yishui to intercept them, and fierce fighting ensued. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses. In addition, more than 500 Japanese soldiers from Anqiu, with several cannons and 12 vehicles, advanced to Baoquan on March 26 and continued to invade south. On the first of this month, they arrived in the area south of Rizhao. Puppet troops also moved west. The Chinese army fought on two fronts and finally managed to repel the stubborn enemy, preventing them from invading south. The Chinese army has dispatched strong forces to monitor Linyi. At this moment, the Japanese army in southern Shandong is at the end of its rope.</p>
<h3>Regular Army Arrives in Yixing; Thug Wu Zizhen Executed by Firing Squad; Local People Rejoice at the Removal of a Great Evil</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Yixing reports, according to reliable sources, that three divisions of the central regular army, led by General Shangguan Yunxiang, have recently arrived here. The numbers are the 70xth Division, the 10xth Division, and the 11xth Division, to strengthen the defense of Yixing. The Japanese army stationed in Yixing County and the areas of Heqiao and Caoqiao is deeply frightened. The soldiers of the three divisions passed through the highways within the Japanese defense zone and the cities and towns at night and reached the territory controlled by the Chinese army in the mountainous area of Zhangzhu. When they passed through the Japanese-occupied areas and towns, traitors reported to the Japanese army headquarters. However, the Japanese army not only ignored the report but also avoided them from afar. The area occupied by the Japanese army in Yixing is only the area through which the highway north of Yicheng connects Wujin, Wuxi, and Jiangyin. However, this area is a plain with many rivers and marshes and no mountains. All the mountainous areas are under the control of the Chinese army, and the Japanese army does not dare to go deep. As for the local administration in areas outside the highway, it is still under the central county government. The county government is located in the mountains of Zhangzhu, and all administrative functions are carried out as usual. The puppet county government in Yixing City is only a nominal entity, used by local thugs and pettifoggers to exploit the local people. The puppet county chief, Zang Lichen (said to be a small boss from a candy store in Shanghai), arbitrarily extorted money and has amassed tens of thousands. His only capable henchman is Wu Zizhen, a famous thug in Yixing. Since Wu became the puppet district chief of the Second District, he incited his lackeys to kidnap people for ransom, committing all kinds of evil. The local people suffered greatly. Because the Second District is known to be a wealthy area, Wu used his puppet power to extort as much as possible, collecting land taxes. The local people hated him to the bone. His puppet district office was located in Zhou Tieqiao, where more than 40 Japanese soldiers and 100 puppet police were stationed to use their special powers to extort money from the local people. The Japanese army was stationed in Zhuxi Elementary School in the town, and the headquarters was located in the Chen Xiaoshan's house next door. The puppet police were stationed in the district office and the City God Temple. After Wu became the puppet district chief, he recruited his cronies Pan Xingfen, Wang Shuhuai, Hang Erlang, and Zhang Mou to serve as his henchmen and handle the affairs of the district office. His method of collecting land taxes was not based on the number of mu of the tenant farmers but on their wealth as the standard for extortion. If they did not comply, he would incite the puppet police to detain the tenant farmers and extort ransom. The farmers were in a dark and hopeless situation, truly unable to live. Fortunately, Wu was recently arrested and executed by the guerrillas. The local people were overjoyed. Wu's various illegal acts were heard by the regular army stationed in Yixing. After an investigation confirmed the facts, a large detachment of soldiers from the 33rd Brigade was dispatched on the night of the 6th of this month (the eve of the Qingming Festival), setting out from a mountain somewhere and rushing to Zhou Tieqiao Town overnight to surround the town. The vanguard broke into South Street, first killing the puppet police on guard, and then surrounding and disarming the puppet police camp stationed in the puppet district office. These motley crews were caught off guard in their sleep, like a bolt from the blue, dumbfounded and obedient, handing over their weapons, a total of more than 60 old rifles. Another route went straight to the City God Temple by water. The puppet police in this unit also did not resist and were disarmed by the regular army and locked up in one place. Wu Zizhen's henchman Hang Erlang was arrested and confessed that Wu's secret residence was at Zhang Xiaofeng's place behind the Fangxian Tea Room on North Street (Zhang is the youngest daughter of the late gentry Zhang Rongpei). Pan Guoju led dozens of strong men straight to Wu's residence on North Street, forcing their way in. Wu was still asleep, lying neck to neck with his mistress Zhang Xiaofeng, enjoying a beautiful dream. When he heard the door kicked open and the strong men entering with guns, Wu was terrified and at a loss, only kowtowing and begging for his life. He was first forced to hand over more than 30,000 yuan of the puppet tax he had collected, and then Wu and his accomplices Wang Shuhuai and mistress Zhang Xiaofeng were put in handcuffs, like pigs and sheep being led into a slaughterhouse. At first, the three of them kowtowed and begged, and then, under the guns and blades, they were escorted away. At that time, the Japanese army stationed in Zhuxi Elementary School heard gunshots from the southwest and knew that something had happened. They fired machine guns randomly in the school, not daring to go out, only making empty threats. The Chinese army also responded with rifles around the perimeter to lure them out of their nests so that they could be ambushed and killed. However, the Japanese army was as timid as mice and never dared to open the door to resist, except for firing machine guns randomly. The Chinese army completed its mission and escorted Wu and the other four southward by water and land. When they reached the Shuimen Bridge about three miles from Zhou Tieqiao, Wu tried to escape again, jumping into the river in the hope of a lucky escape. However, with handcuffs on both hands, he could not swim in the water and was shot and killed in the river by soldiers. In the midst of the chaos, Wang Shuhuai and Zhang Xiaofeng seized the opportunity to escape, disappearing into the night and impossible to track. As for Hang Erlang, who was arrested, after interrogation, it was found that he was not a major perpetrator, and he was allowed to escape death, but he had to pay a fine for redemption. The next morning (7th), the Japanese army stationed in the town acted spiritedly, closing all the gates of the town, intending to search house by house. Later, after repeated mediation by small traitors, while they were still undecided, they suddenly heard that Wu's body had been found at the pier of the steamer station. The Japanese army ordered small traitors to buy a coffin worth 24 yuan and hastily collect the body, carrying it to the Fire God Temple for temporary placement. A trail of blood dripped along the way, and the spectators all clapped their hands and cheered.</p>
<h3>The Administration of Fujian Province in the Past Year (Continued) Focusing on Both Manpower and Material Resources</h3>
<p>Regarding the work of concentrating material resources: (1) Increasing production: (1) Improving agricultural and food production, (2) Immigrating and reclaiming wasteland, (3) Cooperative production, (4) Improving farmland planning and water conservancy projects, (5) Improving the cotton textile industry, (6) Promoting tea production, (7) Paper industry management. (2) Protecting and continuing to develop agriculture, industry, and commerce. Assisting the iron industry is particularly active. There are more than 100 iron factories of various sizes in the province with weak capital and simple equipment. The provincial government assisted them in moving inland in July last year. In this way, production tools such as agricultural tools, water pumps, looms, flour mills, oil presses, and auto parts can be manufactured using the factories relocated inland, so that production tools will not be lacking due to the war, and the factories can maintain their original business. (3) Facilitating transportation and regulating material resources. For the sake of consolidating national defense and long-term resistance against Japan, on the one hand, the coastal highways of the province are thoroughly destroyed or prepared to be destroyed. On the other hand, efforts should be made to develop inland transportation in order to plan a flexible wartime transportation mechanism and facilitate the transportation of rear resources. (4) Controlling material resources and preventing aiding the enemy. Fujian has a "Fujian Provincial Products Trading Company," which was recently reorganized into "Fujian Provincial Trading Company," specializing in the export of the province's specialties and the purchase of goods needed by the province, and undertaking the business of entrusting and transporting goods in various places. Offices have been established successively in Nanping, Pucheng and other places outside the province and in the province. National goods stores have been established in Nanping and Yong'an to promote the use of national goods, and wood and tea departments have been added to handle wood and tea sales, so that the province can reasonably control the goods exported to Japan. Regarding the issue of food management, the interim measures for food regulation and the province's regulations on food box transportation announced by the central government are handled separately, and a food bureau is established to be responsible for food storage and regulation, the investigation of transportation forces and tools near warehouses, the registration of food merchants, processing plants, and warehouses in the province, the organization and reorganization of food agencies in counties and districts, the investigation and registration of food exports and imports in counties and districts, and the promotion of brown rice, etc. Therefore, the food management of this province is becoming increasingly strict. (5) Conserving material resources. The administrative expenses of the province are being tightened to meet the needs of the anti-war economy, and three major principles of wartime finance have been decided: (1) Use the income from existing operations to maintain future recurring expenditures, so as to balance recurring revenue and expenditures. (2) Use other sources of revenue as rear service expenditures, so as to avoid shaking the foundation of normal administration. (3) Postpone the repayment of some old debts and reduce interest to reduce the current burden, and continue to repay some debts as usual to maintain credit. According to this principle, the number of estimates originally compiled last year has been reduced by one-third, but what has been reduced is administrative expenses, and the construction costs of production undertakings have not been reduced very much.

<h3>Youth Should Possess Good Morals and Healthy Sexual Function</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science from a Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Among the noble desires of youth, none is greater than cultivating a complete personality to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of future society. Likewise, among the responsibilities of adulthood, none is more important than making good use of one's innate talents and the cultivation received through education to bear the immense burdens of society. It is regrettable that the majority of today's youth, despite possessing good intentions and correct desires, ultimately succumb to base temptations due to weak morals and a careless mindset, coupled with a lack of sexual knowledge. They develop undesirable habits and indulge in self-destructive behaviors. Within a few years, both their physical and mental well-being are bankrupt, and some even contract diseases and lose the will to live. This is the harm caused by indulgence.</p>
<p>In the imaginations of young people, they generally believe that there is a most mysterious and powerful impulse within the human body, an irresistible force of attraction toward the opposite sex. Even their bodies and minds are often driven by it. When these feelings first awaken and reason is not yet fully developed, there are often bad companions who broadly misinterpret their own sexual experiences, sometimes even forcing them to engage in imitative experiments. The result of these experiments is only shame and self-reproach. Therefore, some young people often deeply regret their past mistakes, cherish their purity, and resolve to overcome temptations, and they will still be useful people in the future. However, there are also many young people who repeatedly make mistakes, and although they know it is wrong, they still associate with bad friends, often indulging in sexual desires due to momentary evil thoughts. Premature ejaculation and impotence result, and their married life is plunged into suffering.</p>
<p>Countless young people, due to self-abandonment, contract masturbation habits or become dissipated and degenerate, leading to the outbreak of sexual dysfunction and neurasthenia. Based on my many years of clinical experience in treating such diseases, the most effective treatment is glandular endocrine therapy. Patients can purchase and take "Body-Con," a genuine chimpanzee testicular essence preparation for men produced in Germany, three times a day. It is indeed effective in nourishing the brain, kidneys, and blood. This is because the agent is rich in animal testicular essence and also contains brain-nourishing phosphorus and metabolism-promoting papaya, so the effect is five to twenty-five times better than similar preparations on the market. However, during treatment, one should abstain from masturbation. Those with spermatorrhea can take "Naires Anti-Spermatorrhea Tablets" to stop it. For women experiencing post-marital infertility, menstrual irregularities, or breast health issues, taking "Body-Con" for women can achieve rejuvenation effects. I have proven this in clinical experiments. Most similar preparations on the market are not good and have significant gastrointestinal side effects, but "Body-Con" truly lives up to its name and has a remarkable anti-aging effect when taken regularly.</p>
<h3>The Cure of Masturbation and Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, Doctor of German Medicine</p>
<p>Patient Ma Wenjie, 21 years old, from Changzhou, works in a factory. He is fond of wine and women. At the age of seventeen, he was tempted by bad friends to engage in masturbation to satisfy his desires, which became a habit over time. He masturbated at least two or three times every night, and the consumption of his essence and blood was immeasurable. After more than a year, spermatorrhea was discovered, but he could not quit masturbation. At this time, although he had taken sperm-locking pills on the market, they had no effect at all, and he also had the phenomenon of sperm flowing when seeing beautiful women during the day. Subsequently, neurasthenia symptoms such as brain weakness, tinnitus, forgetfulness, and insomnia arose. He came to me for treatment. I ordered him to quit the bad habit of masturbation, strictly follow hygiene practices, and avoid stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol. He underwent electrotherapy for 15 minutes every day and was ordered to take "Naires Anti-Spermatorrhea Tablets" to strengthen his sperm gates and treat spermatorrhea. He was also given "Body-Con," a German testicular essence preparation for men, to nourish the deficiencies and treat various neurasthenia symptoms caused by masturbation and spermatorrhea. Mr. Ma followed my instructions. Within a month, spermatorrhea and spermatorrhea were gone. After two months, neurasthenia symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, tinnitus, and insomnia were completely gone. After three months, all symptoms disappeared, and he gained weight, his complexion became rosy, and he regained his inherent health.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea is Not Incurable</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>For any disease, if it is not a terminal illness, there is ultimately a cure. However, this cure must be in harmony with the illness. The treatment of gonorrhea is also the same. The gonococcus is indeed extremely stubborn, but it is not an incurable disease. However, because this bacterium is good at spreading and scurrying around, general local chemical therapies and membrane-penetrating sterilization therapies are difficult to achieve results. This was proven in my clinical practice when I studied medicine in the United States. However, if one can take a medicine that causes the body to produce an anti-gonococcal toxin, allowing it to exert its full power to encircle and suppress gonococci and completely eliminate all gonococci, then all gonorrhea, such as chronic leukorrhea or newly onset leukorrhea, and other complications, can be directed as desired and completely cured. How can it be said that gonorrhea is incurable?</p>
<p>"Kelinong" is a medicine invented by Dr. Peter of Germany and has been tested and analyzed in various countries around the world, proving that it has special effects. This is because "Kelinong" is made of a mixture of yellow pigment and protein. After taking it, each cell can automatically exert an anti-gonococcal and bactericidal effect within a few minutes. However, this effect does not hinder the physiological functions of healthy parts and cannot be compared with inferior drugs with strong side effects. This is because "Kelinong" directly attacks and destroys gonococci at the lesion site, which is not achieved by any oral medication for gonorrhea. It is appropriate that European and American doctors unanimously promote and enthusiastically praise this agent. According to Dr. Fink, director of the Gonorrhea Department of a German venereal disease hospital, "Kelinong" has cured more than tens of millions of gonorrhea patients in the past decade. Its achievements are indeed beyond the reach of general oral medications for gonorrhea. For gonococcal prostatitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, orchitis, cystitis, and leukorrhea in women, taking "Kelinong" all has unexpected special effects. In terms of external medications, women can use "Carder Snow Di Yin Dao Pian" as suppositories, and take "Kelinong" internally. In men, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used externally according to the diagram and instructions to treat themselves at home. After a short period, they can be completely cured. To say that gonorrhea is incurable is a deceitful and unbelievable statement.</p>
<h3>Lung Disease and Hemoptysis</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang, Physician</p>
<p>Hemoptysis in lung disease is due to the fragility of blood vessels in the affected parts. It is caused by rupture of the blood vessels due to exercise and coughing, resulting in hemoptysis symptoms. Tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and all disease changes progress extremely slowly. However, hemoptysis is its actual onset, so effective treatment must be taken and absolutely cannot be neglected. However, in theory and experience, hemoptysis is not an absolutely critical condition, but it cannot be regarded as a minor symptom. According to my more than 20 years of experience, "Bu Fei Kong Er" can increase the patient's own resistance and shrink the lesions, causing the bacteria to die from encirclement and confinement. Therefore, it can not only cure hemoptysis, but also eradicate the source of hemoptysis. I say that hemoptysis in lung disease is not terrible for this reason.</p>
<p>A Brief Exploration of Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>Infertility is Not the Wife's Fault</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Yao Juyan, Physician</p>
<p>In today's society, where men and women are not yet completely equal, the responsibility for having no children is often placed on the female partner. Even when a man suffers from gonococcal prostatitis and becomes infertile, it is blamed on the woman. This is a judgment that often inverts the facts. In many cases of gonorrhea, it is often due to improper treatment of the patient or unreasonable intraurethral injections, which lead to the gonococci being induced from the urethra into the prostate ducts, and from this main duct, they spread into dozens of glands. As a result, gonococci multiply and produce offspring everywhere, secreting toxic fluids. The prostate gland becomes inflamed due to this gonococcal toxic stimulus, which is prostatitis. However, in the initial stage, only the part of the prostate gland adjacent to the urethra is inflamed, and the seminal vesicles are not subjected to gonococcal destruction, maintaining their ability to secrete fluid and aid sperm activity. If the patient abandons treatment or the treatment is not effective, the gonococci gradually spread to all parts of the prostate gland, causing the entire excretory duct of the prostate gland to completely lose its function and become blocked. Once the secretory function of the prostate gland is completely stopped, the wife will naturally have no possibility of conception. I have encountered this symptom very often. There was a Mr. Li, a middle-aged man who had gonorrhea at the age of twenty-six. Although he was treated afterwards, it was never completely cured. Since then, his wife has not conceived, and he suspected that his wife was infertile. After my treatment, I learned that he had prostatitis, so I used German static electricity therapy for him and administered "Kelinong." Within five weeks, the gonococci were completely eliminated. Last month, his friend Mr. Wang came to me for treatment for sexual neurasthenia and said that after Mr. Li's treatment at my clinic, his wife became pregnant and is about to give birth.</p>

<h3>Charity Basketball Second Battle: China Youth Loses Again by One Point, Fuyou Wins Again 34 to 33, Women's Qixiu Wins Chongde Again</h3>
<p>The second charity basketball game between China Youth and Yeyou started at 8:30 last night at China Youth.</p>
<p>First, the women's Qixiu and Chongde competed. After the start, Chongde's momentum was extremely strong, leading by as many as ten points with 18 to 8 in the first half. However, their lineup fell apart later. In the last few minutes, Qixiu relied on Zhang Jiapei's throw to come back to life. Chongde suffered a second defeat. The game between China and Fudan was very tense. China Youth unfortunately suffered too many losses during the adjustment in the first half. Although they tried hard to catch up in the final battle, they failed to surpass and lost by one point. The tightness of the battle was enough to be thrilling. In addition, the veteran teams of Fudan and Guanghua have been organized and are scheduled to practice at China Youth at 7:30 tonight.</p>
<p>Qixiu Wins Again: Chongde relied on penalty points to open the record first. After that, it went smoothly, with the first quarter becoming 6 to 3, and leading with 18 to 8 in the first half. After the change of sides, Qixiu tried to counterattack, and Zhang Jiapei was extremely active, chasing to 15 to 18, only three points behind. In the last quarter, the atmosphere was extremely tense. Qixiu gradually caught up, and Liu Zhenbao's shot made it 25 points each. Yan Weiwen shot in a goal, and Qixiu took the lead. Zhang Jiapei made a good comeback, and Qixiu was able to defeat Chongde again with 29 to 27.</p>
<p>China Youth Suffers a Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>The main battle was unveiled. Fuyou fought with Zhang Jinxiang, Da Mao Cai Yanxiong, Zhou Dayun, and Chen Xuesong as the strongest lineup. China Youth was Yuliang, Jusheng, Xilin, Kong Guangyi, and Dong Yangfeng. Dayun made one of two penalty shots, opening the record. The two sides came and went very quickly, making it 6 points each, and then 11 points each for the third time. At that time, China Youth changed to a wheel-fighting method. Except for Kong Guangyi, the other four were replaced by Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Chen Xianglong, and Ren Xiangcheng. Unexpectedly, it backfired, and the situation took a sharp turn. Fuyou had an advantage of 15 to 11. China Youth hurriedly called down Shen Yugong in a hurry, but it was useless. In the first half, it ended up lagging behind with 13 to 19. After changing sides, Fuyou changed to Lu Dazhen. China Youth made amends and still dealt with the five people at the beginning of the game. China Youth indeed saw improvement. Xu Jusheng and Zhiliang were unstoppable. In an instant, they scored eight points in a row, and the difference was close to 21 to 25. The situation was ever-changing. At this time, both sides were eager to win and fell into a melee. Zhang Jinxiang made atonement and threw the ball into the basket, making the score 30 to 27. Soon after, Kong Guangyi committed four fouls and was dismissed, replaced by Zhuo Guorong. Dazhen made both penalty shots, making it 34 to 27. Although China Youth tried to retaliate, with Li Zhenzhong on the field, Xu Jusheng made a penalty shot, chasing to 34 to 33, a difference of one point. Just as they were about to take advantage of the momentum, time waited for no one, and the bell rang, resulting in a disastrous defeat.</p>

<h3>Public Concession: Record of the Annual Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers: Passing Last Year's Accounts and This Year's Budget, Improving the Western District Authorized the General Works Bureau to Handle It, General Manager Fankeling Made a Concise Report</h3>
<p>This year's annual meeting of foreign ratepayers was held at 2:30 PM yesterday at the Grand Guangming Cinema. The attending directors were Fankeling (General Manager), Mai Kenuodeng (Deputy General Manager), Gao Nixu, Kaiziwei, Mai Tangnaer, Masu Si, Miqi Han, Gang Ben, and Shan Ban. The attending staff were Feixindun (President), Feilipu (General Office), and Fute (Finance Director). Da Zeng was appointed to be the chairman of the annual meeting, and Allen was appointed to be the secretary of the annual meeting. First, the chairman reported on the motions, followed by a speech by General Manager Fankeling. (Motions 1 to 3) Elected the chairman and secretary, and adopted the rules of procedure for the meeting. (Motion 4) Elected the Land Committee for the year of decision. Mr. Bao Miansun proposed and Mr. Dulok seconded, requesting the election of Mr. Gelong as the Land Committee for the year of decision. The resolution was passed. (Motion 5) Elected four directors of the Public Hospital for the year of decision, requesting the election of Mr. Gao Nixu, Mr. Xia Li, Dr. Deng En, and Dr. Bai Ersheng as the directors of the Public Hospital for the year of decision. The resolution was passed. (Motion 6) Please pass the report and accounts for the whole year of 1938. The resolution was passed. (Motion 7) Please approve and adopt the budget expenditure for the year of 1939 proposed by the current directors, together with the attached recommendations, and authorize the Public Works Bureau to collect and recover the various donations, taxes, and fees proposed. If deemed appropriate, the Public Works Bureau shall be allowed to raise funds up to 12.1 million yuan or its equivalent in other currencies, to cover the various uses specified in the temporary expenditure budget. Then, Si Di Huaite stood up and proposed that this budget should be tightened, but the assembly still gave its approval and passed the original plan. (Motion 8) Regarding the issue of the exchange allowance and living allowance for the liaison officers of the Public Works Bureau, a special committee composed of business people has studied and reported, and its efforts for the bureau are of great value. Now, please instruct the director-general of the bureau to express his gratitude to the chairman and members of the committee. It was vetoed by the assembly and not passed. After Harris listened to General Manager's speech on the issue of police power in western Shanghai, he immediately proposed to improve the situation in the western Shanghai area, seconded by Lideer, and the principle was approved by the assembly to be handled by the Public Works Bureau. Later, someone temporarily proposed to improve education in the concession and increase the funding for medical institutions. Because it was related to Motion 7, it was included in the discussion of that motion. It did not disperse until 5:20 PM.</p>
<h3>General Manager Fankeling's Speech</h3>
<p>The following is an abstract of General Manager Fankeling's speech: I am honored to serve as the General Manager of the Public Works Bureau, and my one-year term is about to expire. It is my duty to propose Motion 6 and ask you to approve the bureau's report and accounts up to December 31, 1938. This annual meeting of taxpayers indicates that another municipal year of the bureau has come to an end amid arduous struggles. In the past year, the bureau has encountered various problems, which contain very difficult and complex natures. The matters involved include refugee relief, food and fuel management, Bund wharf facilities, opening factories in the residential area of the western district, recovering the administrative rights of Hongkou, and suppressing terrorist incidents, etc. As for the various ongoing problems that the bureau must pay attention to at all times, there is no need to elaborate. Today, I do not want to describe all the matters one by one. Most of these matters have been explained in detail in the bureau's 1938 annual report. The public who are concerned about the administrative status of the bureau can pay attention to the above-mentioned annual report. What I intend to state should be limited to certain matters that can be considered particularly important or require more detailed explanation or explanation. There are some events that are deeply concerned by the general public, but due to the special internationality and international relations of the Public Concession, it is inconvenient to discuss them freely at the meeting.</p>
<p>Terrorist Incidents</p>
<p>Terrorist incidents are a problem that the public has paid much attention to recently. Those who use assassination as a political weapon do so not only in China, but also in the chaotic situation of today's so-called civilized world. Political assassinations often occur in various countries. This kind of crime is caused by secret actions and cannot be prevented or curbed. Based on our experience, it is undoubtedly impossible for any country to eradicate this kind of crime, even if it has the most highly trained and most efficient police agency. In the past year or so, there have been more political assassinations in the Public Concession. These crimes are not limited to one group or one party. Some of them show a trend of returning to the Middle Ages. This trend is truly shocking in the modern situation.</p>
<p>The bureau's police officers already have繁劇(heavy and complex) work, but some people say that they are unable to completely prevent the occurrence of political crimes during this extraordinary period. I think this harsh criticism is inappropriate. The environment in which the bureau's police officers perform their duties is unique in the world. The area they serve has suffered from war, and the deep-seated hatred caused by the war is brewing secretly. The population in this area is very dense, and countless narrow streets and alleys can lead in all directions, thus naturally becoming a breeding ground for criminals and bandits. Moreover, people from all sides can easily enter due to the terrain and environment. These facts cannot be ignored. The Japanese authorities feel the importance and difficulty of this issue and have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the bureau's police officers to curb terrorist incidents. On the one hand, the bureau does not recognize that the bureau's police officers can be subject to any restrictions. On the other hand, it is willing to cooperate with the Japanese side in the most friendly spirit, but on one condition, that is, any cooperation method must be agreed upon by the head of the bureau's police department and implemented after consultation with him. In other words, the police power belonging exclusively to the police officers of the Public Concession in the areas actually not under the command of the army within the Public Concession should be preserved. Agencies not belonging to the Public Concession Police Department shall not exercise police power in those areas. Exercising surprise power in each area</p>
<p>Salaries of Employees</p>
<p>The salary issue of the bureau's employees has also been noticed by the public and has aroused much comment. During the past year, the fall in the exchange rate of Chinese legal currency and the post-war situation have caused the cost of living in the concession to soar. Therefore, the bureau has reviewed the salary schedule of employees from time to time, and in June and July, it approved the issuance of special living allowances to Chinese and foreign employees of lower grades. By the end of last year, the cost of living was still rising, so that the bureau had to plan the salary issue more thoroughly. Moreover, the salaries given to employees by the bureau were quite low when converted into foreign currency, which made it more difficult for the bureau to recruit professional talents. At the same time, the bureau also heard that some senior professionals also intended to resign because of this. After the bureau's Committee on Assessment and Remuneration considered this issue, it decided to increase the living allowance for low-level employees and approve Class A employees to receive full exchange allowances according to one-third of their salary. This method has been approved by the bureau's board of directors. In order to easily attract contracted employees and prevent professional personnel from resigning, the bureau also passed a motion to improve the treatment of twenty senior employees. There is a lot of misunderstanding about this matter from the outside world. I want to state here that the bureau's improvement of the treatment of these senior employees is not to compensate for their living expenses. The bureau's intention is to make the salaries of at least some personnel equal to the salaries of personnel who work in Shanghai and elsewhere and have the same ability and bear the same responsibilities, so that the personnel who are currently employed and those who are planning to be hired in the future can work with peace of mind. Any taxpayer who has studied this issue and knows the salaries of civil servants in other major cities in the world can admit that the income of the current senior employees of the bureau is still less than that of the same-level employees who serve elsewhere. After the bureau's resolution was announced, the public criticized it. In order to listen to the opinions of taxpayers as much as possible, the bureau hired business people to form a committee to review the bureau's resolution and express its opinions. Xuan Shan, a member of the committee, submitted a report and suggestions. The committee agreed with the bureau's method of issuing allowances to the lowest-level employees, but did not approve of the bureau's method of giving preferential treatment to the highest-level employees. It suggested that all Class A employees should receive a living allowance in addition to the exchange allowance that the bureau has already approved. This suggestion was adopted by the bureau. The bureau reduced the salaries of senior employees and should notify them six months in advance according to the regulations, but each of these employees voluntarily gave up their rights, so the suggestions of the special committee could be implemented immediately. What taxpayers should pay attention to is that the committee did not comment on whether the basic salary schedule set by the bureau is appropriate. The current applicable salary schedule is based on the recommendations of the Employees' Economic Committee. When the committee was meeting, there was hope that the exchange rate would be stable for a long period of time. The amount of salary was determined based on this fact and the situation at that time. Any salary schedule cannot be applicable in all situations, even when drastic changes occur in the exchange rate and general situation. According to the land regulations, taxpayers and the bureau have their own responsibilities. The bureau is responsible for hiring employees and determining the amount of their salaries. Regarding this matter, there is one thing to remember, that is, the municipal administration of the Public Concession has an international nature. The bureau should maintain the standard level of municipal administration. On the taxpayer side, you should know that the bureau sometimes has to revise a part of the salary schedule. The bureau must hire new employees with the ability to handle affairs to compensate for the death, resignation, or dismissal of employees. If possible, these employees should be hired locally. Otherwise, they must be hired from abroad. At that time, if the amount of salary promised by the bureau is the same as the current one, it may not be possible to find satisfactory talents. Unless the value of Chinese legal currency has an unforeseeable rise at present, the bureau may have to consider how to increase the amount of basic salary when it encounters such situations.</p>
<p>This year, two of the bureau's highest-level employees will retire, one is the bureau's president, Mr. Feixindun, and the other is the bureau's finance director, Mr. Fute.</p>
<p>President's Retirement</p>
<p>Mr. Feixindun was elected as a director of the bureau in 1930 and served continuously until 1929. He served as the bureau's general manager between 1923 and 1929. Since 1929, he has served as the president. During the two years of 1925 and 1927, the bureau was in a troubled time. Fortunately, Mr. Fei led his colleagues to overcome the difficulties. The work of Mr. Fei as president is naturally of a confidential nature and cannot be fully understood by taxpayers, but his colleagues who are close to him all know that his contributions are of great value. Every general manager has relied on Mr. Fei and consulted him for his opinions. Mr. Fei is calm, far-sighted, familiar with the history of Shanghai, and has a deep understanding of law. Therefore, the value of his service is very important. The bureau's colleagues express their respect. Mr. Fei will retire this year, and it is a pity. Fortunately, Mr. Fei does not intend to leave Shanghai far away and can still guide him at any time, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Finance Director's Retirement</p>
<p>Mr. Fute, the bureau's finance director, will also retire before the board of directors adjourns this year. Mr. Fu has been the acting finance director since 1924. In 1928, he was officially appointed as the finance director. The responsibilities of the bureau's finance department have been increasing during Mr. Fu's tenure. In 1928, the bureau's budget for both regular and special expenditures was 38 million yuan, while this year's budget is more than 82.5 million yuan. The bureau's tax stock in the general office has been transferred to the finance department since 1932. Therefore, Mr. Fu's duties are even more difficult. During Mr. Fu's tenure, the bureau has signed extremely important agreements with several public utility companies. Mr. Fu has participated in the negotiations on these agreements. Mr. Fu joined the bureau in 1908. In that year, the bureau's regular income was 3 million yuan, and the value of its assets was 12 million yuan. This year, the bureau's regular income is 28 million yuan, and the value of its assets is 170 million yuan. The financial credit of the Public Concession is outstanding, and thanks should be expressed to Mr. Fu for this. Mr. Fu could have retired in 1936, but he continued to serve until now because the bureau retained him.</p>
<p>Last Year's Accounts</p>
<p>The accounts of the last year have been explained in detail in the finance director's report. Looking at the final accounts, you can see that the amount of the deficit in that year was reduced by more than 782,000 yuan compared with the budget deficit. The main reason for this is that the amount of donations and taxes collected in the second half of the year increased significantly. The reasons for the increase in donations and taxes are, first, the development of industry in the western district, and second, the reduction of vacant houses south of the Suzhou River. However, at the same time, the drop in the value of Chinese legal currency has caused the bureau's expenditures to increase quite a lot, especially expenditures such as pensions and retirement allowances. In addition, the living allowances given to employees by the bureau were not included in the original budget. As for the facilities of the bureau's various departments, they are all subject to considerable restrictions. Some works have been temporarily shelved due to the poor environment, so the expenses are relatively low. As for the various measures of the public works, they are quite significant, but the expenditures of the health department exceed the budget. A part of the expenses directly spent on refugee relief has been offset by the funds withdrawn from the entertainment donation. As for the various special expenditures, they are also limited. The public works that have been carried out are only the essential ones. However, due to the continued existence of the emergency situation, the bureau's emergency expenses have exceeded the budget by a lot. The bureau's investment bank has absorbed fixed deposits since the beginning of last year. The results of this kind of short-term turnover method have been listed in the annual report.</p>
<p>This Year's Accounts</p>
<p>The budget for the year 1939 has been sent to you for review a few days ago. The budget is attached with a detailed explanatory note, so I only need to raise a few points for your attention. On March 8 this year, the bureau's board of directors held a meeting to discuss how to balance this year's regular budget. According to the budget opened by the finance director, if the bureau collects donations at the current donation rate, the deficit will be 3 million yuan in national currency. Various expenses have been reduced as much as possible within a seemingly feasible range. As for the income, it is estimated with a reasonably optimistic eye. The total amount of budgeted expenditures is about 5.7 million yuan more than last year. The reason for the sharp increase is almost entirely due to the drop in the value of the national currency. The bureau expects that the reduction of vacant houses, the development of industry, and the increase in franchise fees payable by various public utility companies can increase income, but the two are offset and still feel insufficient. In order to balance this budget, the finance director intends to ask the bureau to increase the ordinary house donation and the special house damage donation rate in the boundary area by 2% each from July 1 this year, and to increase the land tax at the same ratio from the same date. The remaining shortage of 1.75 million yuan can</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>be compensated in the same way as the deficit in the previous two years. The director's recommendation has been reviewed and approved by the Finance Committee. If the bureau can maintain its credit and enable various major municipal works to proceed as usual, it is not willing to increase donations at this time. However, after the board of directors carefully considered all aspects of this issue, it believed that the increase in donations must be implemented this year. However, in order to notify taxpayers in advance so that taxpayers can prepare, it was decided to change the date of commencement of the increase in donations to October this year. According to the current proposed method, the donations and taxes additionally collected from taxpayers this year are approximately equal to 3% of the actual amount paid by taxpayers last year. If calculated on a full-year basis, it will increase by approximately 12 and a half percent compared to last year. The price of goods and public utilities in this city has risen by more than this amount in the past nine months. Now, calculated by the income after the increase in donations from October 1, there is still a shortage of approximately 2.3 million yuan in the budget, which must be prepared. The bureau intends to follow the precedent of the previous two years and withdraw this amount from the reserve fund, so as to balance the budget. As for the amount withdrawn, it should be returned from the surplus in the future budget or compensated by other fundraising methods. What you should pay attention to is that the reserve fund that the bureau can dispose of is not inexhaustible. In fact, the amount of this reserve fund is quite limited. Therefore, any opinion that someone has that the reserve fund should be used up is not something I dare to agree with. The education expenditure for this year totals 2,354,000 yuan, an increase of 351,240 yuan compared to last year. This amount is approximately equal to one-seventh of the house donation and land tax collected by the bureau. Regarding the special budget, there is one thing that can be stated to you, that is, the bureau's construction plan has been reduced to the minimum limit. The expenses for handling various emergency affairs, paying off public debts, and compensating for this year's deficit have all been included in this budget. Now, I intend to ask you to allow the bureau to raise funds up to 12 million yuan. This amount may not be fully raised. The fundraising method used should be considered by the next board of directors.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting: Difficult to Write About the Meeting Place</h3>
<p>The annual foreign ratepayers' meeting was held at the Grand Guangming Cinema at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The Westerners who attended the meeting were seated in the upper and lower seats, totaling more than 1,000 people, wearing Western suits and leather shoes, young and old gathered together. Outside the gate, there was a Western-language white cloth banner of the Western Ratepayers' Association. Before the meeting, Chinese and Western detectives gathered together and pointed out the seats to the people entering the venue, which was very thoughtful. On the left side of the rostrum, there were seven seats for Chinese newspaper reporters, and on the right side, there were seats for Western newspaper reporters. The seats on the rostrum were H-shaped. In the middle was the seat of Chairman Mo Shaopu, and on the left and right were the seats of the directors of the Public Works Bureau. The Japanese directors Gang Ben and Shan Ban were seated on the right side of the rostrum. Yesterday, Mr. Kaiziwei, a director of the Public Works Bureau, wore a formal dress to the venue, and his dignified demeanor was noticed by the people in the audience. There were only two participants in the audience who wore Chinese clothing, namely Mr. Zhu Guilin, a reporter from the Huaji Xinsheng Society in the side hall, and a reporter from this newspaper, which can be said to be unique. There were many Western reporters who attended, and there was also a Western female reporter, who also temporarily sat in the seat of the Chinese newspaper reporters. The venue was equipped with a sound system, and the sound was exceptionally clear. Yesterday, the person who spoke the most at the meeting was Mr. Fankeling, the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, who reported on the administrative situation of the Public Works Bureau for as long as one and a half hours. The audience held their breath and watched attentively. After the report, the crowd applauded warmly. When discussing the various motions, Mr. Stewart, an attendee, stated that he did not fully agree with the proposed budget increase of the Public Works Bureau and posted two papers explaining his opinions next to his seat. When he stated his opinions, he poured tea while speaking, and his attitude was quite洒脱(unrestrained); but the result of the case, after public discussion, was not established.</p>
<h3>French Concession Yesterday: Interference with County Flag Incident - National Flag Returned After Negotiation, Those Arrested Promised Release</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Farmer-Industrial-Commercial sector propaganda day of the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. All sectors of the city telegraphed greetings and comfort to Chairman Chiang, wishing for final victory. From 7 a.m. yesterday morning, all major stores and households in the Public Concession and the French Concession uniformly and voluntarily raised the national flag as a concrete expression of citizens implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization. The atmosphere was unusually enthusiastic. However, the French Concession authorities interfered with the flag-raising by stores within the concession. From 9 a.m. yesterday, the French police dispatched large numbers of detectives to various roads to advise stores to take down the national flag. However, stores along Avenue Joffre and other areas protested, stating that it concerned national dignity and sovereignty, and refused to comply. Unexpectedly, Russian and Annamese police forcibly took down the flags displayed by the stores. However, after the Annamese police left, the stores re-hung the flags. As a result, the detectives compelled the stores to hand over the national flags and took them back to the police station. However, driven by enthusiasm, the stores purchased more new flags and raised them again. Their spirit of perseverance fully demonstrated the fervent patriotism of the citizens.</p>
<p>Dispute Causes Store Closures</p>
<p>However, the French police continued to send large numbers of detectives to continue interfering. An apprentice at the Da Guangming Underwear Store in the West Xinqiao area was beaten in an argument with an Annamese policeman, and the store owner was arrested. Others, such as the Tai Kang Food Company, Guan Sheng Yuan, Wang Da You, Zhong Hui Underwear Company, He Ming Shoe and Hat Store, Shanghai Hat Store, Hong Da Mat Store, Tong Sheng Rice Store, Mei Ya Watch Store, Wu He Weaving Factory, An Da Sock Factory, and Tian Xiang Zhai Cake Shop, had their national flags forcibly taken away. Furthermore, the glass storefront of the He Ji Food Store on Ximen Road was smashed by police. Approximately forty people were arrested in total. As a result, all the stores automatically closed. As of last night when the draft was being written, all stores east of Ba Xianqiao and west of Dengjia Muqiao had successively closed. The Golden Theater cancelled tickets last night and temporarily suspended performances to express its determination. Several stores, such as Nanyang Western Clothing Store, on Avenue Edward VII, also closed.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel for Negotiations Leads to Satisfactory Result</p>
<p>After the above incident occurred, various organizations in this port, upon hearing the news, were deeply saddened. In addition to sending personnel to comfort the interfered-with stores and households, they also dispatched representatives to negotiate with the French authorities. It is reported that the French authorities have agreed to completely release the arrested personnel and return all the confiscated national flags. The National Spiritual Mobilization Association headquarters' letter to the compatriots of the city is transcribed as follows: "To the people of the city, yesterday (the 19th) was the Farmer-Industrial-Commercial sector propaganda day of the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. Citizens from all walks of life in our city unanimously raised flags, and the situation was enthusiastic, which is commendable. Unexpectedly, the French Concession authorities interfered, arrested citizens, and confiscated national flags. This unfriendly behavior is deeply regrettable. However, our compatriots, despite being unjustly interfered with, displayed a heroic and unyielding spirit, witnessed by Chinese and foreigners alike. This unwavering attitude is a concrete manifestation of the National Spiritual Mobilization of the citizens of this city. Currently, various civic groups in this city have urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting serious negotiations with the French Ambassador to China, in order to strengthen the friendly relations between China and France. This matter should achieve a satisfactory outcome. We hope that our compatriots will await the government's resolution and jointly maintain social order. We are fortunate, we are fortunate." Headquarters of the Shanghai Citizens' National Spiritual Mobilization Association.</p>
<p>Proclamation by the French Concession Authorities</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities issued the following proclamation regarding the flag-raising dispute: "Regarding this proclamation, it is hereby known that any government demonstration or movement is strictly prohibited within this concession. Such demonstrations are clearly intended to cause trouble and are instigated by troublemakers who disrupt public order and safety. While respecting individual opinions, this authority has the responsibility to take necessary steps to maintain the absolute neutrality of the concession and the peace and tranquility of its residents. If necessary, troublemakers will be expelled. Regarding collective flag-raising, except on National Day, all acts of a political demonstration nature are especially prohibited. It is specially declared that all residents must be aware. This is imperative."</p>
<p>Armed Patrols Create a Serious Situation</p>
<p>After the stores on Avenue Joffre successively closed, the French police, fearing an incident, dispatched large numbers of Russian and Annamese police to be stationed at key intersections on various roads. At the same time, armored vehicles and fast cars were deployed for patrols to suppress crowds gathering and inspect pedestrians. The situation was very serious, especially in the area in front of the Golden Theater.</p>
<h3>Spiritual Mobilization Committee Encourages City Youth with Four Key Points to Mutually Encourage and Share the Responsibility of Saving and Building the Nation - Today is Education Sector Propaganda Day</h3>
<p>Today is the Education sector propaganda day of the National Spiritual Mobilization. In addition to holding large-unit teaching sessions on the outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization in all schools across the city and publishing special editions in various newspapers, the Education Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association also issued a letter to the city's youth, which is excerpted as follows: "Young people are the pride of the times. They possess simple minds, intelligent brains, lively spirits, strong physiques, and a glorious revolutionary history. In China, whether it is politics, culture, or science, there is nothing that is not initiated, promoted, and transformed by young people, gradually reaching its goal. During the May Fourth Movement, our country's youth not only made brilliant contributions to the enlightenment of politics and culture, but also the majority of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang were young people. Subsequently, during the May 30th Movement, the September 18th Incident, and the January 28th Incident, there was not a single instance where young students were not actively agitating in the great tide of national salvation. From the tense situation in North China to the sound of gunfire at the Lugouqiao Incident, the actions of young people are especially worthy of excitement and encouragement. From the front lines to the rear, from regular warfare to guerrilla warfare, nearly hundreds of thousands of young people have endured the wind and rain, hunger and cold, rushing around and working hard, sacrificing themselves to save the country. In the history of national revolution, this is indeed worthy of special mention. But what about the young people on our isolated island? There are certainly those who are hardworking, dedicated, and strive for the country, but more than 80 percent of the youth are still living a life of hedonism, preserving their habits of seeking temporary safety, filled with a deathly atmosphere, neither seeking knowledge nor seeking action. Everything from the spirit of vigorous development, the determination to bravely move forward, the frugal and incorruptible customs, and the morality of loyalty and knowing shame has become as rare as the morning stars on the isolated island. Although there are over one million young people on the isolated island, the majority are actually waiting to be subjugated or waiting for the arrival of victory, willingly abandoning the sacred mission of saving and building the country during the Great Revolution. Even if they examine their consciences late at night and cannot help but feel ashamed, they will probably be cursed by later generations. Now, what we hope for from the city's youth are the following points:</p>
<p>Collective Struggle: The more society evolves, the more people's work becomes collective. Only collective work can generate enormous power. Saving and building the nation especially requires that all the people of the country be organized and mobilized within a group. The National Spiritual Mobilization is intended to use this group spirit and power to help the military resist the enemy and help the government build the nation, so that final victory can be achieved quickly and the nation can be restored. Therefore, young people must not only give up individualistic activities and enthusiastically participate in this group, but also automatically organize this group or promote and encourage others to participate in this group.</p>
<p>Unified Faith: China's War of Resistance is not only to achieve national independence and freedom, but also to simultaneously advance and concretely implement the Three Principles of the People: Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood. Since we are to build a free and happy new China based on the Three Principles of the People, then we must have a common faith in the Three Principles of the People, study the Three Principles of the People, propagate the Three Principles of the People, and strive to save the country for the Three Principles of the People. Furthermore, after having a common faith, we will certainly be able to move from mutual faith to mutual trust, making the national united front as strong as cement. Using this to eliminate the enemy, no enemy cannot be defeated. Using this to build the nation, what fear is there that we will not achieve our goal?</p>
<p>Concentrated Will: During the War of Resistance, after having a common faith, we must also have a common will, without divergence or confusion, moving forward towards a common goal, so that the enemy is weakened and shaken, and then collapses. The so-called common goal is that regardless of what kind of work or career, we must not be afraid of trouble and must carefully design it so that it helps the War of Resistance and benefits the country and the nation. In other words, we must at all times keep "the country above all, the nation above all, national affairs first, and victory first" in our hearts as the premise for all work and careers.</p>
<p>Life Reform: In addition to the above, personal habits and life also have a great impact on the War of Resistance and national construction. Waste in terms of economy and time will certainly weaken the economy of the War of Resistance and delay the time of victory, and being listless, complacent, mediocre, and romantic is more than enough to lead to national subjugation. Moreover, the soldiers on the front lines are sacrificing themselves for the nation, and countless compatriots are suffering for the country. How can we alone enjoy ourselves? As for the young people studying at school, they should especially be hardworking, energetic, and vigorous, set an example for other young people, work for the War of Resistance, and seek knowledge for national construction. From today onwards, we must jointly take on the responsibility of saving and building the nation, so that both economy and time can move forward on the road of revolution.</p>
<h3>Japanese Restrictions on Foreigners Traveling Between Shanghai and Hankou - Large Group of Russians Stranded for Half a Year Before Reaching Shanghai - Many Other Foreigners in Hankou Unable to Travel</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that forty-seven Russian men and women, stranded in Hankou since October last year, arrived in Shanghai on Sunday aboard a Japanese transport ship. Their businesses in Hankou were closed due to the war, and they had been trying to get to Shanghai for half a year. Although there were many Japanese merchant ships carrying passengers between Hankou and Shanghai, they were not permitted to board the transport ship until last week. It is reported that many other foreigners in Hankou are waiting to be transported to Shanghai, but have been unable to find a way to travel. At the same time, many foreigners in Shanghai have also been unable to travel to Hankou and other Yangtze River ports. Foreign merchants in Shanghai and Hankou have repeatedly expressed their dissatisfaction with the Japanese restrictions, but to no avail. It is reported that some trading firms feel that the restrictions on passenger traffic to and from the Yangtze River are causing extreme inconvenience. Staff members of foreign trading firms in Hankou who have reached the end of their terms are therefore unable to depart, and those who should be transferred there are also forced to remain in Shanghai. It is reported that it is easier for Chinese to travel to various Yangtze River ports than for foreigners. They can travel on Japanese merchant ships if they hold permits issued by the Japanese military authorities.</p>

<h3>President of Columbia University Mourns Xu Xinliu and Liu Zhanen - Praises the Perseverance of University Students - Intensifying World Situation Proves Moral Collapse</h3>
<p>The "Continental Times" reports that yesterday (the 18th), this port received the 1938 annual report from Dr. Butler, President of Columbia University in New York City, and President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The report contains Dr. Butler's praise for the perseverance of Chinese university students in carrying out their work during wartime. The report also states that even amidst Japanese bombings and</p>
<p>air raids, Chinese international relations groups continued to work tirelessly. Amid rumors circulating in the surrounding countryside that Japanese bombers were approaching, they still sent several books and reports from their recent meeting to the Endowment's American office. The report also stated that the assassination of Dr. Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University, was a great loss, as Liu made contributions to international understanding. The death of Xu Xinliu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Association of the Pacific Academic Conference, also caused setbacks to the work of international relations. Dr. Butler criticized the current international tensions, saying that people all hope for peace, and while both democratic and dictatorial governments claim to be committed to peace, countries around the world are engaging in military build-up. Dr. Butler found the explanation for this anomaly to be</p>
<p>the complete collapse of public morality, which has affected the policies and plans of governments. Furthermore, the people of democratic countries lack the wisdom and courage to firmly urge their governments to act in a constructive manner and eliminate the causes of war.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Passengers Return Home Safely - Endeavor Arrives in Ningbo - Ningbo is Peaceful</h3>
<p>After the mouth of Zhenhai in Ningbo was ordered by Chairman Chiang to prohibit ships from entering and exiting from April 5th, the Italian merchant ship "Endeavor" of the Sino-Italian Company was specially permitted to transport 17,000 bags of wheat from Shanghai and sailed to Ningbo the day before yesterday. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Ningbo at 8 a.m. yesterday, but was delayed until around 11 a.m. due to heavy fog on the eastern Zhejiang waters. According to a telegram report from the "Endeavor," Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang is as peaceful as usual. After the wheat is unloaded, it will return to Shanghai immediately. The "Hanna" transported distressed Dinghai passengers from Shanghai and sailed to Dinghai the night before last. According to a telegram report today, it had docked at the Dinghai pier at 2 p.m. yesterday and will return to Shanghai from Dinghai at 4 p.m. today. Furthermore, the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters was ordered to restore the Ningbo Martial Law Headquarters, and Guo Chiping was concurrently appointed as Commander. This has been announced to the public.</p>
<h3>Accountants' Association Discusses Wartime Losses - Xi Yushu Proposes Supplementary Measures - To Serve as the Basis for Accounting Treatment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants' Association held a regular board meeting yesterday to discuss Member Xi Yushu's letter proposing supplementary measures for dealing with wartime losses, requesting discussion, etc. It was decided that Member Xi's proposed points are related to the basis for accounting treatment after industrial and commercial enterprises have been affected by the war and should be submitted to the board for discussion and distributed to all members for their opinions. The original letter and supplementary measures are transcribed as follows: "Dear Sir, the four measures proposed by my member to the Ministry in the past were intended to consider the matter reasonably and to preserve the vitality of industry and commerce within the possible scope. Now that they have been approved by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in the front and approved by the Ministry in the rear, I will again contribute my humble opinion and propose several supplementary measures for handling wartime losses, hoping for a public decision: (1) The scope of wartime losses: all wartime damage to fixed assets and inventory. Fixed assets should be listed as losses based on their original cost minus accumulated depreciation. Inventory should be listed at book value (if reserves have been made, it should be the book value minus the reserves). Accounts receivable in the war zone that cannot be recovered may also be listed as wartime losses. (2) Evaluation of fixed assets located in the war zone that have not been moved out and still exist: calculate the degree of damage proportionally or invite experts to appraise. The remaining amount should be listed as war zone assets, and the damaged portion should be included in wartime losses. (3) Wartime losses should account for a maximum of three-fifths of the capital (original text submitted to the Ministry). Only those enterprises with obvious prospects for recovery can be included in deferred assets. Otherwise, if the amount of wartime losses exceeds three-fifths or more, a shareholders' meeting should be convened to discuss increasing capital or reducing capital. (4) Enterprises that have suffered wartime losses should first use their public reserves and various reserves to offset them. If there is still an insufficient amount after the offset, it should be listed as deferred assets. (5) Various relocation costs of fixed assets during wartime changes should be listed as expenses if they are small and affordable. If such expenses do not exceed 30% of the original cost, they should be added to the value of the fixed assets. If the amount of expenses is very large, they should be listed as wartime losses and treated as deferred assets. (6) Enterprises with sufficient financial resources, constant surplus capacity, and profits should retain more profits after paying income tax, in addition to appropriately allocating official profits, and should allocate more to amortize losses to consolidate strength. They should not distribute too many dividends, which would be contrary to the government's purpose of maintaining industry and commerce. (7) Enterprises whose wartime losses do not exceed three-fifths of their capital can increase or decrease capital as they wish. (8) Property in the war zone that has not yet been lost should be listed as a 'War Zone Property' item. Wartime losses should only be included when there is a loss. The maintenance cost of this property should be included in the calculation of war zone property. (9) Enterprises that have suffered wartime losses and have already completed their final accounts for the 26th and 27th years can now reorganize and correct them based on the Ministry's approved method. (10) After processing according to the above supplementary measures, the original loss-making enterprises may instead report a profit, meaning that those whose losses exceed one-third of their capital or whose assets are obviously insufficient to pay off debts can therefore avoid the responsibility of directors and supervisors convening a shareholders' meeting and declaring bankruptcy. Furthermore, if the enterprise's wartime losses, after being processed according to the above measures, still exceed one-third of their capital or their assets are obviously insufficient to pay off debts, they should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law."</p>
<h3>Four Organizations Yesterday Farewell McDonald - McDonald Held Important Positions in the Municipal Council - Striving for Local Welfare - Chinese Ratepayers Association Sends Letter of Thanks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Local Association held a farewell dinner at the International Hotel last night at 8 p.m. for McDonald, the Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council. More than 20 Chinese and Western guests attended. After Yu Qiaqing delivered a speech on behalf of the four organizations, McDonald gave a speech of thanks. Furthermore, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession also sent a special letter of thanks in accordance with the resolution of the Representative Assembly. The speeches and letter of thanks are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Mr. McDonald, gentlemen, a few years ago, a certain evening newspaper opened a column entitled "In the Eyes of the Chinese," the intention of which was to provide an opportunity for Chinese to express their views on current affairs and for foreigners to consult with them. As a result, the opinions expressed in the column, in addition to occasional disagreements between Chinese and foreign commentators, often echoed each other. This shows that the distance between the human observation capabilities is not very far. Tonight, I am honored to represent the four organizations in delivering a speech, trying to be among the ranks of that column. However, the discussion should be based on the topic of tonight. Tonight, we are gathered together to bid farewell to Mr. McDonald, who is taking leave to return home. Recently, there have been voices of praise for Mr. McDonald's morality and career among Westerners. However, "in the eyes of the Chinese," what kind of person is Mr. McDonald has not yet been heard. I can solemnly declare that in this matter, as in all other matters, the views held by the Chinese are no different from those held by the Westerners. Mr. McDonald is as respectable and admirable "in the eyes of the Chinese" as he is in the eyes of the Westerners. Mr. McDonald has been doing business in Shanghai for 19 years and enjoys a high reputation. At the same time, he has been working hard in social services, serving as Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and chairing various committees for many years. His political achievements are very prominent. As a result, he has developed a very deep and lasting friendship with the people of Shanghai. In the speeches delivered by Mr. McDonald, we can see his deep concern and attachment to the local welfare and the happiness of the citizens of Shanghai. No wonder Mr. McDonald often feels that Shanghai is a place he cannot easily abandon. This is also something that the people of Shanghai are happy to maintain for a long time without weakening. Perhaps Mr. McDonald has not fully realized the depth of the Chinese people's admiration and friendship for him. What I can tell you is that Mr. McDonald's Chinese name, "Mai Ke Nuo Deng," is the most familiar name among Westerners in the city to the Chinese people. If we consider that Mr. McDonald's Chinese name has as many as four characters, and the pronunciation and transmission are extremely difficult, and if we add the title of "General" or "Mr.," it is even more difficult to imagine, then we will know that the Chinese people's knowledge of his name is not accidental. Mr. McDonald is gentle, courteous, and humorous, and he is also straightforward, saying everything he knows. His temperament is in harmony with that of upright Chinese gentlemen, so we can know that the Chinese people's feelings for him are deep and well-founded. The Chinese directors of the Municipal Council especially respect Mr. McDonald because he is courteous and gentle and can work together. All matters concerning the legitimate interests of the Chinese people can be expected to receive his assistance. Finally, I should solemnly thank Mr. McDonald for his enthusiasm for refugee relief work. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, Mr. McDonald, Mr. Xu Jiqing, and I have served as Chairman and Vice Chairman, working together for charitable and public welfare. Checking on and assisting refugees is a very serious problem after the war in Shanghai. Mr. McDonald has a deep understanding of this issue and has spared no effort to find a solution. Even if Mr. McDonald is only present at meetings and discussions, it is enough to make everyone feel admiration. His connection to the public is so great. I am very grateful for Mr. McDonald's enthusiasm for assisting and cooperating. I believe that all Chinese and Western colleagues present will also be grateful to the refugees. Gentlemen, Mr. McDonald's career achievements in Shanghai are a major contribution to promoting the current friendship between China and Britain. Please join me in raising a glass to Mr. McDonald!</p>
<p>Letter from the Taxpayers Association: The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association's letter of thanks to McDonald states: "Dear Sir, on April 17th of this year, the Association held its first representative conference of this year. During the discussion of the motion, it was noted that Mr. McDonald, the Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, had made outstanding achievements in maintaining security within the concession and assisting in refugee relief. Now that he is requesting leave to leave Shanghai, the Association should express its gratitude in the name of the representative conference. The motion was unanimously passed. Accordingly, the case is recorded and sent to you, and I express the gratitude of the ratepayers to your Excellency. I also hope that you will accept it with kindness." To Mr. McDonald.</p>
<h3>Profiteering Merchants Speculate: Selling Fake Permits; Main Culprit Awaits Arrest and Interrogation</h3>
<p>Recently, anyone wishing to go to areas nominally "occupied" by the Japanese army must obtain a permit from the Japanese military. As a result, speculative businesses facilitating the acquisition of these permits have sprung up. These so-called "walking papers" are crudely made, yet sold at exorbitant prices. This has led unscrupulous individuals, blinded by greed, to widely counterfeit and fraudulently sell them. When discovered by the Japanese military, buyers not only lose money but also suffer other hardships. Consequently, authorities have repeatedly severely punished counterfeiters, but without completely eradicating them. The Hongkou police recently uncovered a fake permit operation at Room 107 of the Zhenhua Hotel on Fuzhou Road, where they sold permits deemed counterfeit by the Japanese military. Two local suspects, Zhu A’da and Wang Shi’de, were apprehended, and dozens of photos left by permit buyers were seized. However, the main culprit, Zhao Zi'an, remains at large. The following day, Zhu and Wang were transferred to the First Special District Local Court for detention, to continue the pursuit of the main culprit and a thorough investigation, before requesting prosecution and punishment. Judge Fang interrogated Zhu and Wang briefly and ordered them to be detained for further questioning next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Chen Qiansheng Assassination Case: Concubine Released, Deemed Uninvolved</h3>
<p>Chen Tingsheng, also known as Chen Sanzi, a native of Zhenjiang residing at No. 39, Haigeli, Haige Road, Xujiahui, was fatally attacked with pistols and knives at 6:00 AM on March 20th. The attack was orchestrated by his mistress, Wang Guizhen, in collusion with her lover, Tao Boqing, who funded the operation. The French police have successively apprehended the instigators Wang Guizhen and Tao Boqing, as well as the perpetrators of the murder, Na Aliu, Wang Liansheng, Cao Quanfa, Shen Jinfa, and a total of twelve individuals. They were transferred to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention, with a scheduled retrial on the 28th, as previously reported. It has now emerged that the French police also arrested Cao Aliu (19 years old, a local), a concubine of the deceased Chen Tingsheng, suspecting her involvement. She was detained along with the others. However, investigations have revealed that Cao is not involved in the case. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Cao was sent to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Yao Qidi, a lawyer representing the French Concession's administrative authority, stated that the police investigation found no criminal activity on the part of the defendant and recommended her release. Judge Liao Tan approved the report and ordered Cao's release, stipulating that she should appear in court on the 28th for questioning.</p>
<h3>Landslide Occurs in Tangjiawan: Seven or Eight Houses Collapse; Reportedly All Unoccupied</h3>
<p>Near the Xiaocaichang market in Tangjiawan, outside the Old West Gate, adjacent to Lanwei'ai Road, that is bordering the French Concession, several houses have been unoccupied since the focus of the war shifted inland. Due to disrepair, seven or eight houses collapsed suddenly last night around 7:00 PM. The loud noise of the collapse startled many, but fortunately, the houses were all unoccupied, preventing a major disaster.</p>
<h3>Opium Public Sales Bureau: Controls Opium in the Suburbs; 120 Opium Dealers in Shanghai; Intensified Policy of Intoxication</h3>
<p>Since a certain power implemented a policy of intoxication in western Shanghai, opium dens have proliferated in the Caojiadu area, openly selling opium, spreading the addiction throughout Shanghai. Recently, this has intensified. The opium supply is now entirely controlled by a certain power, implementing public sales. The Public Sales Bureau is located in Hongkou, with four branch bureaus in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and western Shanghai. Zheng Shixia, owner of the Shan Zheng Qia Ji Opium Firm, and Lan Basheng, owner of the Lan Yi Yu Opium Firm, serve as the Director and Deputy Director of the Bureau, respectively. Zheng Chuanying and Jiang Yumen serve as the Director and Deputy Director of the western Shanghai branch bureau. Zhong Xiaorong, Zhang Baohua, and Lin Rongchang are responsible for the Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong branch bureaus, respectively. Opium is transported by warships from the Rehe and North China areas. There are several types, including red soil and "North Soil" (i.e., Rehe soil). A total of 120 opium dealers, large, medium, and small, have been established in the suburbs, requiring business licenses. Large opium dealers must first pay a security deposit of 50,000 yuan, medium dealers 10,000 yuan, and small dealers 5,000 yuan. Zheng, Lan, and others advanced a total of 1.5 million yuan in security deposits, which has been paid to a certain power (reportedly the backer is Sheng Lao San from Changzhou). The establishment of public sales branch bureaus and opium dealer locations in each district has been finalized. The Nanshi branch will be located in the Nine Mu Land area, Zhabei in Tianbaoli, the Shanban Factory, and the northern end of the Xinqiao bridge; Pudong on Dongchang Road, and western Shanghai remains in Caojiadu. The opium sold by each dealer is supplied by a certain power through the Public Sales Bureau. It is clear that the spread of addiction in Shanghai is expanding.</p>

<h3>Wife Illicitly Dallies with Fake Police Chief; Husband Murders Wife, Then Commits Suicide; Both Die from Violent Cleaver Wounds to the Throat</h3>
<p>Zhu Keting, 34 years old, from Baoshan, has worked at the Chen Yuan He rice shop in Caohejing town, western Shanghai, for over a decade. He married a woman surnamed Jin from his hometown, who is 24 years old and quite beautiful. After the fall of Baoshan, Zhu brought Jin to Shanghai to seek refuge, renting a house in the Wu family compound in Longhua town. Their marital relationship was generally harmonious. However, last year, Jin had an affair with a man surnamed Jia, the fake police chief of the town, and their clandestine relationship was not a one-time thing. Now, Zhu Keting has discovered the secret and found a fake police uniform in their room, leading him to contemplate murdering his wife. The night before last, while Jin was sound asleep, Zhu used a cleaver to violently slash her throat more than ten times, severing the throat bones and leaving a bloody mess. She died instantly. Seeing that Jin was dead, Zhu did not wish to live and committed suicide by slitting his own throat. By morning, neighbors discovered Zhu, still barely alive, but he soon died.</p>
<h3>Suicides of Men and Women</h3>
<p>Liu Wangshi: Liu Wangshi, a young woman from Fengtian, is 29 years old. Her husband is Taiwanese and runs the Dasheng Eye Hospital at No. 390, Museum Road.

She was discovered and taken to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Zhang Rongsheng: Zhang Rongsheng, a guest staying in Room 35 of the Nanyang Hotel at No. 394, North Zhejiang Road, is 30 years old. Due to financial pressure, he hanged himself in his room yesterday afternoon. He was discovered by a waiter, but he had already died.</p>
<p>Zhu Changfa: Zhu Changfa, a young man of 19 residing at No. 58, North Fujian Road, took his own life yesterday afternoon at 2:24 PM out of despair, swallowing tranquilizer pills. He was discovered and taken to the Refugee Hospital on Xizang Road for treatment.</p>

<h3>Child Killed by Truck</h3>
<p>Zhou Jiton, 38 years old, from Zhenjiang, a partner at the Hua Yu Hardware Store at No. 1, Lane 2, Jixiang Street in the French Concession, resides at No. 63, Ningshaoli, Jiangxi Road, in the British Concession. He has a son named Heshang, 9 years old, and a daughter named Xingzhu, 17 years old. Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, Zhou's wife sent her two children, Heshang and Xingzhu, to Jixiang Street in the French Concession to buy incense and candles. They walked on Aiduya Road, the younger brother in front, the older sister behind, crossing the road. As they walked to No. 71 on the south side, a truck with license plate F2434, driven by a Russian driver named Shamoer (transliteration) from the Xuefolan Transportation Company, fully loaded with goods, was traveling from north to south on Jiangxi Road and turned west onto Aiduya Road. Zhou Heshang was unable to avoid the truck and was knocked down, suffering head injuries and bleeding from both ears. He collapsed on the ground. Chinese Constable No. 2866 of the British police arrived, recorded the license plate number, and sent the injured boy to Renji Hospital. He died before receiving treatment. The French police were notified and sent investigators. The body was transported to the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy, awaiting an examination by the Second Special Court today.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Sail Out of the Huangpu River: Only Three Remaining in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Renji Hospital Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shandong Road Renji Hospital held its annual meeting on the 18th (the day before yesterday) to thank internal and external colleagues who have enthusiastically supported the hospital's operations over the past year, and to report on the past year's activities. The financial income included 15,000 yuan in donations from foreigners, 13,000 yuan in donations from Chinese, 50,000 yuan in relief donations from the British, over 7,000 yuan from the International Red Cross, and 173,000 yuan from medical services.

<p>Bamboo Shoots Taxed According to Market Value; Customs Approval Granted; Tax Rate Per Stone Estimated at Fourteen Yuan</p>
<p>This year's climate is initially cold and then warm, so the supply of bamboo shoots has suddenly become brisk and prices have fallen. However, due to the environment, Zhejiang bamboo shoots imported into Shanghai must be subject to customs duties, but the authorities still calculate based on the initial selling price of 30 yuan per picul, meaning that bamboo shoot merchants not only make no profit after paying customs duties and transportation costs, but also suffer financial losses. Therefore, the Wukang Bamboo Shoot Industry Shanghai Office sent a letter to the local goods industry trade association of this city, requesting that it forward to the customs authorities the request to assess taxes according to the estimated selling price to alleviate the burden on bamboo shoot merchants. Yesterday, the local goods industry trade association prepared a letter recommending representative Yang Tiaogong, along with guest representative Qiu Leshan, to meet directly with the customs authorities to request that they assess taxes according to the market value to alleviate the difficulties of the guest side. This has now been approved, and in the future, taxes will be assessed at 14 yuan per picul, greatly benefiting bamboo shoot merchants, which is no small matter.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Special District Hygiene Testing Laboratory: Successful Experiment with Gonorrhea Preparation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Hygiene Testing Laboratory has many years of experience in testing and examining gonorrhea sufferers. It has been discovered that a certain gonococcus in the patient's body, after being cultured and high-pressure sterilized to make a uniform solution, is effective in curing gonorrhea. Based on this principle, the laboratory carefully studied the process, and after hundreds of clinical experiments by doctors from major hospitals, and with improvements, it achieved the greatest success. After application of this gonorrhea preparation, there are no side effects such as constipation, indigestion, or other adverse reactions. Because the drug's efficacy lies in causing the blood to produce a large amount of antitoxin, which can exterminate gonococcus and dissolve toxins, it can thoroughly treat the disease and prevent recurrence. This is very different from the sandalwood oil preparations and diuretic antiseptic drugs generally available on the market. Currently, to meet the needs of the patients, the laboratory has specially provided the prescription to the Guanghua Pharmaceutical Factory to manufacture a product called "919" Gonorrhea Vaxing. It is sold in major pharmacies and companies in this city. Starting tomorrow, the Wing On Company's Western Medicine Department and the Jihuatang Pharmacy will offer a limited sale of 919 boxes at half price for three days. It is also reported that those who purchase and take this medicine can have a free examination at the Shanghai Special District Hygiene Testing Laboratory on Baiguan Road, so that patients can thoroughly understand their condition.</p>

<h3>Ranking of International Status</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Everyone knows that countries have different rankings in the international community. Some are first-class countries, while others are second or third-class. The strength of military power is the standard for ranking, with the strong above and the weak below. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, China was roughly between second and third-class, while Japan considered itself in the first-class rank. Now, the facts tell us that this ranking has changed: Japan, as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "has been pressed down to the status of a second-class country by our War of Resistance," while we, as some foreign observers say, are on the path to becoming a first-class country.</p>
<p>This change is both contradictory and complementary. In other words, during the intense fighting of the past twenty-two months, their military power has weakened day by day, while our military power has strengthened day by day. Therefore, our rise in status has caused their decline in status. This is naturally not an empty theory, but is based on facts. They are like the melting snow under the scorching sun, dissolving piece by piece. The longer it lasts, the more it dissolves, irreversibly and irredeemably. We are like grains sown in the soil, sprouting, growing, flowering, and bearing fruit, capable of harvesting more grains. Furthermore, the melting of the snow not only does not harm the grains, but can also promote the grains' vitality. Therefore, their initial fierce momentum is helping our current prosperity.</p>
<p>Our rise in international status, in addition to comparing us to our enemies, can also be compared to other weak countries. Among the weaker countries, we were the first to be invaded, because it has been eight years since the Northeast Incident. During these eight years, Abyssinia was annexed first, and recently Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania were eliminated. Yet we still stand strong, resisting the aggressor with resistance, and we are fully confident that we can recover our lost territories in the near future. It is not necessary to discuss whether our military strength has increased. This alone is enough for us to be considered a first-class country without any shame.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said, "If we intensify our War of Resistance, we will certainly make their current second-class status untenable in the near future." Of course, on our side, after we "give them a fatal blow," our status as a first-class country will be undoubtedly secured.</p>
<p>Compatriots, we have suffered enough humiliation in the international community, especially in front of our enemies. Now we have stood up. From now on, we must stand firm, unyielding, and win the final victory, so that we can finally stand tall in the international community!</p>
<h3>When Alone</h3>
<p>— By Gorky, Translated by Fan Xun</p>
<p>Last night, while crossing the Troitsky Bridge, I saw a young woman standing silently. This petite and slender woman hooked her arm, adorned with a brown glove, onto the bridge railing. I watched for a moment, thinking she was going to jump into the Neva River below. But she merely stuck out her nimble tongue, mockingly at the moon in the sky.</p>
<p>The moon, like a cunning old fox, slipped away lightly among the smoky, hazy clouds. It appeared red and large, like the drunken face of a drunkard. Perhaps this woman had suffered because of it. Her action was retaliatory. At least in my eyes, her gesture towards the moon was very cold.</p>
<p>After seeing this interesting event, I thought of other similar little things, causing me to burst into laughter in my memories. As I see it, when a person is alone—at least when they think there's no one else around—their actions are like those of a mentally ill madman, and I can't think of any other word to describe these people making strange gestures.</p>
<p>The first time I saw someone making abnormal movements while alone was in my childhood. After a circus performance, I saw the British clown Langdale, having finished his performance, pacing along a deserted corridor. When he passed a large mirror, he suddenly took off his top hat and bowed respectfully to his own reflection. There was indeed no third person there, but I was sitting in a gutter right above him. He couldn't see me, but I could see his legs very clearly. When he bowed to himself, I even poked my head out to look at him. That day I pondered silently, confused and unable to explain it. But now I think that Langdale was just a fool, someone whose profession was to make strange gestures, and at most just an Englishman.</p>
<p>Many years later, I went to visit Anton Chekhov; I was told he was in the garden. As I walked through the garden gate, I saw him sitting there alone. He was trying to catch the sunlight with his hat to put it on his head, but of course, his foolish idea was not going to succeed. I could see how frustrated he was by the repeated failures; his face turned redder and redder. He quickly slapped his hat against his knee and then hurriedly put it back on his head. Finally, abandoning this impossible game, he kicked the little dog beside him away, half-closed his eyes, and glanced at the sky one last time before tiptoeing back to his house. He saw me at the door, and he smiled and said to me, "Have you read Balmont's rhyming poems? Oh! The sun smiles at the grass! What a silly fellow, isn't it? In Russia, it laughs at the soap bubbles of Katya (the washerwoman); here, it laughs at the sweat of the grass."</p>
<p>On another occasion, I spied on him trying to stuff a thick red pencil into a narrow-necked medicine bottle. Of course, this was a fruitless act. He probably knew he was conducting a grand experiment of breaking a law of physics, and he was doing this ridiculous trick with the scholar’s perseverance and patience.</p>
<p>Leo Tolstoy spoke softly to a lizard, "Well! Are you happy?" The little animal was lying on a stone in the bushes, sunbathing. Tolstoy stood quietly in front of it, in his usual manner, with his hands in the pockets of his wide coat. Finally, the great writer looked around cautiously, then sighed and said resolutely: "If I were like you, I wouldn't be happy."</p>
<p>The great chemist Tikhvinsky was sitting in his dining room, holding a shallow teacup that reflected his face. He shouted loudly at the teacup: "Hey! Old fellow! What are you doing alone?" But the reflection coldly ignored him. Tikhvinsky sighed deeply, his face gradually darkening. He frowned at his own image, twitching his nose, looking like the wrinkled forehead and long nose of an old elephant.</p>
<p>The famous novelist Leskov sat alone at the table, tearing cotton into small pieces and throwing them into a bowl one after another. Each time the small, soft cotton touched the bottom of the bowl, he pricked up his ears to hear if the cotton would make a sound when it landed in the bowl.</p>
<p>Volodysky placed a shoe in front of him and sternly ordered it to walk by itself. "I know you won't walk," he said with a proud look. "You see! Without me, you can't get to where you want to go."</p>
<p>"What are you doing, Dad!" I burst in unexpectedly. He looked at me, and said dismissively, "You're asking about the shoe! This shoe is so small that it only fits my heel. They always make such ill-fitting shoes these days."</p>
<p>Women often talk to themselves when they are alone, decorating or playing. Once, I saw a beautiful and well-educated woman sitting alone in an armchair by the window, eating candy. Every time she picked up her favorite food with delicate candy tongs, she murmured, "Now I'm going to eat you!" After she finished eating, she would say to herself, "Am I the one who ate you?"</p>
<p>In the lounge of a certain theater, there was only one late, dark-haired young woman. She stopped in front of every mirror. Suddenly, I heard her say, "But—everyone has to die."</p>
<p>There was no one else there besides her and me. I was also too late to enter the theater. But I was really too late, so late that I missed the first half of the strange drama she was performing. The room was dark, and she never thought there was anyone else in the room besides her. I think if she had seen me, she would never have asked a stranger such an unusual question. I don't think she would have known to discuss such profound philosophy with me.</p>
<h3>Coming and Unable to Leave</h3>
<h3>"Love" and "Hate"</h3>
<p>— Wallflower</p>
<p>How shall I express the pent-up loneliness? Urgently, I need to hear the sincere voices of humanity. I would be encouraged, invigorated! My life would be adorned with brilliance!</p>
<p>Hailing, shouting, bring only empty echoes. Lead-like, my heart is heavy—.</p>
<p>Disappointment, hesitation? I will not. I will use my life force until the final disintegration before I rest, pursuing the great ravine where human emotions intermingle!</p>
<p>We are endowed with "love" and "hate." Loving what I should love, hating what I should hate, isn't that the most genuine humanity?</p>
<p>Bustling for profit, rushing for fame, confined to a small world, a narrow-minded life has nothing but pity.</p>
<p>Poverty, filth, cunning, deceit, the bricks and stones that build the walls between people, strive to accelerate their collapse!</p>
<p>One who strongly loves life naturally has strong desires for "love" and "hate"! "Love" and "hate" originating from human nature are one and the same, without high or low, good or bad.</p>
<p>Expand our "love" and "hate"! As bland as water? No, as rich as wine!</p>

<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>I often see terms like "wisdom" or "intellectual class." I think the "wisdom" here should be "knowledge." "Wisdom" is "intelligence," which is very different from "knowledge," and what is usually used is actually "knowledge" rather than "wisdom," so "wisdom" should not be used.</p>
<p>Some submitted manuscripts seem to have words that are too small, making them difficult to read; and some have lines that are too tight, making it impossible to make any changes. Please, contributors, be considerate and improve.</p>
<h3>The Literary Lineage of "Glamour" and "Charm"</h3>
<p>— Wu Ling</p>
<p>We have always looked down on women, but sometimes we have particularly looked up to women.</p>
<p>In history, whenever there was a period of "unrest," everyone wanted women to win honor for the country. The way to win honor was to "die." "When bandits came, the head of the household fled, and the women died, died, died. When foreign tribes invaded, civil officials advocated peace, military generals surrendered, and the women died, died, died."</p>
<p>What happened after death? Then our men of letters jumped out: elegies, dirges, you rhymed, I rhymed; even secretly composing one or copying one from somewhere, forcibly placing it on the head of the deceased, saying it was a martyr's death poem, and then composing another one, you rhymed, I rhymed again. And this was called "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs," still for the sake of winning honor.</p>
<p>In history, the "bandits" have really helped us create a lot of "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs." But the so-called "bandits" were the "roaming bandits" that our modern great men speak of, who were all forced out by emperors and officials. If there were no emperors and officials, there would be no "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs." Therefore, our men of letters have always supported emperors and officials. Foreign invasions have helped our "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs" even more, like the Jin, Yuan, and Manchu people. These achievements are easy for us to investigate. These foreign tribes directly created "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs." On the one hand, they all became emperors and officials in the end, so our men of letters simply supported them in the end, regardless of whether they were foreign tribes or not. The evidence is those circulating elegies, dirges, and harmonizing and rhyming poems, which never scolded emperors and officials, nor did they scold the foreign plunder, but only desperately worked on "glamour" and "charm." Naturally, this is "art for art's sake." But in the end, they revealed their "tails": the honor they were fighting for was not really the honor of the country, but only the honor of a few men who were alive and well.</p>
<p>But what if a few women simply refuse to die? Wouldn't that be too lonely for the men of letters? But it doesn't matter. The men of letters have many ideas. Now they are scolding the woman on the one hand and praising the woman on the other. They scold her for having no shame, and praise her for having a beautiful face. So it is still "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs," and this time the "glamour" and "charm" are even more "glamorous" and "charming." As a result, this time the honor completely belongs to the men of letters.</p>
<p>What I have said above are naturally all past situations. As for modern times, there is a slight change. Women are no longer so enthusiastic about dying, and although honor is still needed, they have to find other ways. However, our men of letters seem to still hold on to their past ideas and are still pursuing "glamour" and "charm." However, because it is, after all, modern times, the methods of pursuit have also changed, and they no longer nakedly display the signboard of "glamour" and "charm." What they have are even bigger topics.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the men of letters living in Beijing were very enthusiastic about visiting Sai Jinhua, praising Sai Jinhua, arranging conversations with Sai Jinhua, and inviting Sai Jinhua to dinner. As a result, books came out one after another. It was said that they were trying to find out many anecdotes from the end of the late Qing Dynasty from her mouth, but they immediately said that her knowledge was too poor and she couldn't find them out at all, which was really disappointing. However, even though they were disappointed, the books still had to be published. So there were no anecdotes in the book, but it praised the Qing Empress Dowager, read through the German Marshal, and scolded the "Boxer rebels," to set off a "glamour" and "charm" to complete the matter.</p>
<p>When Shanghai was at war, a bomb fell in front of the "Great World," and I don't know how many poor people, workers, and small businessmen died. But a writer came from elsewhere, passed through this place, and wrote a poem saying that he seemed to see that there were still broken, dyed red fingernails of fashionable women left there, but he didn't see anything else. This is really "glamorous" and "charming." However, this poem was published, and it is said to be a kind of "national salvation literature."</p>
<p>This time, they are going to create historical works about the end of the Ming Dynasty. So a man of letters came out to speak: historical themes must be selected. Naturally, this is correct. But after selecting and selecting, they only selected Chen Yuanyuan, saying that she was more meaningful than the righteous people who resisted the war in Jiangyin and other places at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Naturally, Chen Yuanyuan's background is complicated, but how is she more meaningful than the righteous people who resisted the war? This seems very incomprehensible at first, but as long as you know the ideas in the bones of our men of letters, you will immediately understand. Chen Yuanyuan can be both "glamorous" and "charming." In this respect, those righteous people can only "feel ashamed of their inferiority."</p>
<p>Pursuing "glamour" and "charm" is our "literary lineage." Without this "literary lineage," our men of letters may not have "inspiration."</p>

<h3>Random Talk About Theater in a Crooked House: Actors Changing Careers (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— A Person Who Sings Both Northern and Southern Tunes</p>
<p>Liu Xiaoheng initially sang old male roles, imitating Chang Liheng's plays. His neighbor initiated his education, later he played young female roles, becoming famous for "The Substitute Prince."</p>
<p>Furong Cao changed from young female roles to old male roles, but he didn't become popular. So he changed back to young female roles, wholeheartedly dedicating himself to young female roles, which is why he enjoys today's great reputation.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinfang sang male beard roles when his voice was fine. After his voice deteriorated, he specialized in acting skills, but had a great addiction to painted face young male roles, often making guest appearances. He also had a great addiction to singing plays. "Visiting Mother and Returning to the Order" was still performed. He is now the leader of the acting old male role performers in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Yang Jusheng is the younger brother of Xiao Yang Yuelou. At first, the two brothers studied male beard roles together, and later they both changed to young female roles. Xiao Yang Yuelou became popular, but Jusheng did not. In order to accompany Xiao Yang Yuelou in plays, he changed back to old male roles.</p>
<p>Guan Dayuan originally sang male beard roles, and was greatly praised by Jia Honglin and Liu Jingran. Later he changed to martial male roles, studying under Yang Xiaolou. Because he gained weight, he returned to singing old male roles.</p>
<p>Yang Ruiting came from Qinqiang Bangzi opera. He changed to Jingban opera, first singing old male roles, then changing to martial male roles, also performing painted face martial roles. Later, he specialized in old male roles and old female roles, and also sang red male roles. Recently, through the introduction of Xu Heizhen, he studied Kunqu opera with Master Hongdou.</p>
<p>Gai Jiaotian, when he first appeared on stage, belonged to the Yuxian Troupe, using the name Gai Zhaotan Jiaotian as a selling point, singing male beard roles. After his voice deteriorated, he changed to martial male roles.</p>
<p>Zhang Guobin, originally a singing old male role performer, is the son of the martial female role performer Sai Zhenfeng (i.e., Zhang Yingpu, Gai Jiaotian's younger brother). After his voice deteriorated, he changed to martial male roles, co-starring with his younger brother Zhang Zhibin in the Shen Tingling play. It was a popular play at the Yiwu Stage in those years. Later, he changed to acting old male roles, becoming famous in Liyuan with the Burning Cotton play. He is now affiliated with the Grand Stage.</p>
<p>Jiang Miaoxiang initially sang green shirt roles (Baida Company initially recorded records, which can serve as proof), and also played young female roles. He learned a lot of green shirt plays from Chen Shitou (Delin). Later, he changed to young male roles due to hemoptysis. His daughter married Tan Fuying as a second wife.</p>
<p>Zhang Delu, the son of the martial male role performer Zhang Shunlai, appeared on stage as a child actor, specializing in male beard role plays such as "Li Ling Tablet." After his voice deteriorated, he first changed to painted face martial roles, then changed to martial male roles. He still performs martial male roles to this day. He has a wide abdomen and can write new plays.</p>
<p>Lin Pinqing initially studied martial clown roles, studying under Xu Danling (whether these three characters are correct is to be verified). Because he did not master martial skills, he changed to old male roles, appearing on stage under the name Lin Xiaofen. After his voice deteriorated, he changed to young female roles. Recently, due to old age, he teaches students to entertain himself in his later years. His son, Youxiang, can inherit his mantle and is very famous in the Hangjiahu area.</p>
<p>Pan Haiqiu is the legitimate son of the deceased famous actor Pan Yueqiao (Pan Dingxin, currently affiliated with the Gong Stage, is Yueqiao's illegitimate son). He initially sang male beard roles, named Xiao Liqing. After his voice deteriorated, he changed to young female roles, affiliated with the Xintai Stage in Nine Mu Land for a long time. Currently, he is addicted to smoking and works as a backstage director for Zhang Zhi'er's Huaicao Troupe, earning less than ten yuan a month, which is very tragic.</p>
<p>Wu Fengchun, the son of Wu Yuehua, was a child actor singing male beard roles at the San Malu Civilization Grand Stage in the early years. After his voice deteriorated, he changed to green shirt roles, then changed to young female roles, and later changed to young male roles. He is now known for teaching opera. Most of the rising Kun female roles in Shanghai have come from his tutelage. He was named Wu Zhuchen during the era of singing male beard roles.</p>
<p>In short, actors changing careers is not because of following trends, but because of their voices or their physique. The above is just a rough summary. Those who change careers due to special circumstances are not recorded.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qiuhen Joins Green Treasure: Monthly Salary of 200 Yuan. Today's Performance: Karmic Love and Grievances</h3>
<p>— Ke Wei</p>
<p>After the war, many movie actresses fell into the circle of civilized drama "for the sake of life." We can count Xia Peizhen (now in Beiping), Fan Xuepeng (in Green Treasure), and Ye Qiuxin (in Tianyunlou). There was a rumor for a time that "Dark Circles" Tan Ying would also go to sea, but it did not materialize because the conditions were not negotiated.</p>
<p>Starting today, Green Treasure has another movie star going to sea. Perhaps everyone will not forget this person when mentioned, that is, Zhu Qiuhen, the Beiping girl who was rumored to have married once.</p>
<p>We briefly know about Zhu Qiuhen's life. She used to perform old plays in Beiping. After arriving in Shanghai, she joined the Mingxing Company. Before the war, because she went out to shoot on location, some people rumored that she had a small love affair with someone, which made her and the Mingxing Company not very happy. Later, it was rumored that she would marry a college student, and the two would go to Beiping together. She herself also gave up her screen life and prepared to enter school. Unexpectedly, her dream did not come true in the end. Following that, she "for the sake of life" joined "Green Treasure" like other actresses.</p>
<p>Zhu Qiuhen's joining Green Treasure this time was introduced by Mr. Zhou Bangjun, a shareholder of Green Treasure. She joined Green Treasure with the title of a movie star, so her salary is much higher than the salary of movie stars in general film companies. It is said to be 200 yuan per month. (Several important roles in Green Treasure have salaries of almost 100 to 200 yuan.)</p>
<p>Starting today, Zhu Qiuhen will appear in the Green Treasure Theater in a brand new film and television posture. The play she is performing is called "Karmic Love and Grievances." From then on, there will be one more movie star in the civilized drama world.</p>
<p>Finally, what makes people feel is that, although the "Green Treasure" performance standard is higher than that of other civilized drama theaters, the few movie stars who have gone to sea to perform civilized dramas are certainly not going to sea again "for the sake of improving civilized drama." The main reason they go to sea is just "for the sake of life," alas!</p>
<h3>Zhu Qiuhen</h3>
<h3>Gu Menghu's Unjust Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Imprisoned for a full sixteen hours, released on the afternoon of the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>When Gu Menghu joined the Queen's Theater to perform civilized drama, it was also when the debate on "improving civilized drama" was the most intense. Later, he joined Green Treasure, and in addition to performing on stage himself, he also served as a screenwriter and director. We believe that in the movement to "improve civilized drama," Gu Menghu was still relatively level-headed.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Gu Menghu was contacting a friend about the script, and around twelve o'clock at night, he passed through Fuxu Road and Chengdu Road. That night, the French Concession was inspecting pedestrians particularly strictly. During the interrogation, Gu Menghu somehow clashed with them. At that time, a thing that the patrolman did not recognize was found on Gu Menghu's body, so it seemed that there was even more reason to take Gu Menghu to the patrol room.</p>
<p>Did Gu Menghu really have anything suspicious? Of course not, but that "strange paper" that the patrolman did not recognize was a bit strenuous, so Gu Menghu was detained in the patrol room the first night, which corresponded to the old routine of the old novel called "nothing to say for a night," but Gu Menghu's night was really not easy.</p>
<p>By the next day, that "strange paper" was immediately translated by someone. It turned out to be an ordinary "song score." It was not until four o'clock in the afternoon that he was released. The foreigner in the patrol room also apologized to him before leaving.</p>
<p>During the sixteen hours of being innocently imprisoned like that, he didn't get anything to eat. The first thing that made him uncomfortable was his stomach, which was not forgiving, and was really about to starve through. Wind and Rain</p>

<h3>After Viewing the Chinese Dynastic Paintings and Calligraphy Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Chen Dieye</p>
<p>Pang Xuqi's collections are as vast as the sea, the wealthiest in the country. What is on display here are not even his most prized pieces, yet Wu Zhonggui's "Cold Geese by Lugou Bridge" still possesses the subtle charm of a corner of a hermit's painting. Liu Wan'an's "Summer Clouds Threatening Rain" truly crowns this exhibition. The Wang and Xie families consider seven-foot corals as mere potted plants; for others, exhibiting such pieces would nearly exhaust their collections.</p>
<p>Wu Hufan's contribution is best represented by a collaborative scroll by Dong Qichang and Wu Xuanshui. Xuanzai (Dong Qichang) highly praised Xuanshui in this painting. However, in my view, Xuanzai's brushwork constitutes eight or nine tenths of the work, almost directly emulating the Yuan masters. I have always respected Dong, and this scroll, along with the large pieces in the Qing Palace collection, is also a Dong imperial work. A plum blossom painting by Song Dynasty painter Tang Zhengzhong and a landscape by Ming Dynasty painter Zhou Chen, one being part of Hufan's wife's dowry and the other a hand-picked treasure of Duke Keqi, demonstrate a respect for ancestral legacies. Hufan's gesture is commendable. However, the "Zhong Kui补袞圖" (Zhong Kui Supplementing the Emperor's Robe) labeled as a painting from the Five Dynasties is regrettable. Only the "Yunji Qiqian" (Seven Tablets in a Cloudy Satchel) contains the story of Zhong Kui marrying a "mo." The "Qidong Yeyu" (Anecdotes from Qi East) changes "mo" to "mei," mistranslating it as "younger sister." Later, the story of Zhong Jinshi marrying off his younger sister appeared in Zaju plays. People from the Five Dynasties would not have known this story. Among the Tang and Song paintings in this exhibition, I only lament that the Tang Zhengzhong plum blossom and Zhou Fang's "Playing Children" are there. If we are adhering to the principle of selecting the best, the rest can be excluded. What does Daya think?</p>
<p>Zhang Congyu collected paintings with the goal of ensuring the paper was white and the board new, so his collection is mostly exquisite. Zhou Fang's scroll is a masterpiece. I read in Song Dynasty notes that Tang Dynasty painters Wu Daozi and Zhou Fang depicted women with knitted brows and dark lips, portraying a sorrowful appearance. Su Laoquan also mentioned this. The "Wuxing Zhi" (Treatise on the Five Elements) considered it a sign of moral decay, as it reflected the fashion of women at the time. Today, Wu's paintings are no longer to be seen, and Zhou's depictions of women are no longer like that. Tang Yin, who best learned from Zhou Fang, also didn't paint like that. Could it be that what the Song people saw was accidental? The "Sima Zhongcai Hua and Su Xiaomei" painting by Yuan Dynasty painter Liu Yuan was once in my collection. Congyu loved it and yielded it to me. Many viewers do not know who Liu Yuan was. According to research, Wu, is Liu Lan, a talented sculptor from Yunnan. It is said that the Luohan statues in the Qiongzhu Temple in Yunnan were created by him. Later, Liu Guan wrote a colophon, along with Huang Zijiu's inscription. The seal was that of "Iron Flute Daoist." Congyu considered it a forgery and returned it to me after cutting it off, also a secret in the art world. Among Congyu's contributions, I most like Hua Xinluo's "Red Lotus and Kingfisher," which seems to converse happily with the egrets and reeds, exuding a natural and lively charm. Other works, such as Mo Yunqing's refined elegance and Jianjiang's cold detachment, along with Wang Chong's plumpness exhibited by Hufan, are all rare treasures, forming a triumvirate. Wang Zhenpeng's "Begging Bowl" is the crown jewel of Zhang's collection.</p>
<p>Ding Huikang initially didn't collect extensively, but recently he has become a vigorous collector. This exhibition was initiated by him and includes Bada Shanren's orchids and geese, as well as Zou Fanglu's Mountain Dwelling, all of which are masterpieces. Although the Eight Masters of Jinling are not great masters, Zou Zhe, Xie Sun, and Hu Zao are rare works. This exhibition includes Zou's Mountain Dwelling and Hu Shigong's Dense Forest, collected by Zhao Youqing, which are also treasures. Huikang has a painting by Liu Wan'an, very similar to Dong Xiangguang, but bolder and fiercer. Some considered it doubtful, so Huikang removed it from display, showing his willingness to accept good advice. However, in my opinion, Xiangguang's style originated from Yingqiu Juran, and Wan'an's craftsmanship is equally skillful. Changing the brushwork is acceptable. The painting has a colophon by Yang Xunji, proving its authenticity. To discard it is like carving a mark on a boat to find a lost sword. I wish to discuss this with Daya.</p>

<h3>Securities: US's New Moves on the Pacific Coast Boost Domestic Bonds; Foreign Stocks Also See Progress</h3>
<p>In the securities and foreign exchange market, the trend was up and down yesterday. The morning saw a strong decline, with E-class falling below the two-yuan mark. The intention of the upper echelon seemed uncertain, causing many retail investors to follow suit and sell. In the afternoon, a surge suddenly occurred, with rumors spreading of a special telegram from President Roosevelt to Japan, advocating respect for the interests of third countries and US intervention, raising hopes for peace. Short sellers began to cover their positions, and major bullish players seized the opportunity to raise prices. However, since the current grey market operates on a cash transaction basis, there is no limit of four yuan for price increases. The surge of six yuan in A-class on January 10th serves as a lesson for short sellers. Yesterday, De Fu No. 5 took the lead in selling, suppressing market prices, while simultaneously buying back in. As a result, Tong Shun, Qia Feng, and No. 18, seeing the unfavorable situation, also unloaded their positions. E-class once fell below the two-yuan mark, with No. 40, Shui Feng, and Da Tong showing some appetite for buying. At the close, No. 38 and Le Mao bought A and B-class aggressively, causing a slight recovery. In the morning, the results were small, but in the afternoon, new news emerged, stimulating short sellers to actively cover their positions, resulting in an immediate jump of three to four cents. A-class broke through the two-yuan mark, and C-class also reached three yuan. Da Feng first advanced and then retreated, De Fu bought more than it sold, Run Li absorbed consistently, and both Tong Kang and Mao Tai had needs. The market sentiment was firm and rising, gradually showing signs of taking off. In the end, the market price rose by two to six cents, with a total transaction volume of approximately 1.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>For stock trading, cloth transactions were 50 shares at a price of 39.75 yuan, higher than before by more than half a yuan. The stock market and morale in the general public association saw some progress, with more buyers appearing. Public utility stocks (such as trams and buses), Jardine Matheson, and Yeguangshe all had good demand. The British company Zha Hua Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay a final dividend of 75 cents per share for 1938. Combined with the interim dividend of 25 cents per share, the total dividend paid was one yuan. This dividend is scheduled to be paid after being announced at the shareholders' meeting on May 4th, which has greatly satisfied the public. Therefore, interest in other rubber stocks has also slightly increased, although most buyers are offering low prices. Jardine Matheson shares are stable with no change. Although the political situation is still uncertain, there is a feeling that the situation in the Far East has reached its worst point and that mediation may be possible in the near future. Even those with a pessimistic outlook may harbor this hope.</p>
<p>In addition, Zha Hua Kang Sha Lai Te Rubber Coffee Co., Ltd., also managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay a dividend of 5 cents per share for 1938. This dividend is scheduled to be paid soon after being announced at the shareholders' meeting to be held on May 4th.</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month (Tuesday), the listed prices of London-based British Far East companies showed limited fluctuations. The Mercantile Bank shares slightly contracted by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of £7 12s 6d. The Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation's Hong Kong-registered shares rose by half a pound, with a price of £82.5. The Kailuan Mining shares rose by 6 pence, with a price of 17 shillings. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sassoon Building-based US China Securities Company previously decided at a board meeting to pay an interim dividend of 4 cents per share on common stock, which began on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month (Wednesday), the listed prices of London-based Chinese foreign debt showed little gain or loss, but the foundation remained weak. British and German continued borrowing. British issued bonds have gradually fallen from a high price of £78 on the 8th of last month, falling by a significant £14 up to the day before yesterday. Yesterday's trading saw a rebound of half a pound, with a price of £64.5. The Crisp loan fell by half a pound, with a price of £36.5. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bonds also fell by 5 shillings, with a price</p>
<h3>Finance: Wealthy Individuals Divest; Cash Prices Reverse Downward; Hong Kong Banks' Purchases Limited</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold grey market was extremely quiet, lacking any highlights. However, the underlying trend suddenly turned downward, mainly because wealthy individuals in the city have shown little interest in hoarding gold. Furthermore, given yesterday's reports that Germany and Italy have taken a cold attitude towards President Roosevelt's peace proposals, their intentions to divest have become more pronounced. A certain money exchange and cash firm successively sold on behalf of wealthy individuals. Although a certain jewelry store continued to absorb on behalf of Hong Kong banks, the amount was limited, and other banks remained cautiously observing. As a result, supply was greater than demand in the scarce transactions, causing prices to fall. In the end, prices fell by five yuan, and transactions were also quite scarce, only 200 taels. Jewelry gold remained at the original price, and customs gold remained stable. Chinese and English pure gold prices moved downward again.</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially opened with a downward trend due to the strong intention of wealthy individuals to divest and the Hong Kong banks' weak absorption. At around 10 AM, a certain money exchange first sold 30 taels to a certain jewelry store at 2,077.5 yuan, an opening price 2.5 yuan lower than the previous closing. After the opening, the cash firm also followed suit and sold a total of 70 taels to a certain jewelry store, all at a price of 77 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange sold another 50 taels to a certain jewelry store at a price of 76 yuan. Afterwards, various parties still wanted to divest, but the certain jewelry store had stopped absorbing, and there was no other demand, making it difficult to trade. By noon, the selling price was still 76 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation remained weak due to the lack of buyers, resulting in few transactions. A certain money exchange sold to a certain money exchange, still calling for a selling price of 75 yuan, but buyers only offered a price of 73 yuan to absorb. The market remained unchanged until the evening close, so the evening closing was still 2,075 yuan, a drop of five yuan from the previous night's closing. The cash firm's selling price for its own brand of gold was 2,080 yuan, and the buying price was 2,070 yuan. The current gold standard was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remains at Original Price</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael has remained at its original price because the fluctuations in cash gold have not been significant. Da Tong Bank's price is 211 yuan, Xin Tong Hang's price is 209 yuan, and the buying price is 203 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Drops by Half a Penny</p>
<p>According to an 18th London telegram, English pure gold fell by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7 8s 6d. As a result, the central bank's purchase price for Chinese cash also fell to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price of customs gold remained flat, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also contracted by 3 jiao, reaching 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Banks Aggressively Settle Forward US Dollars</h3>
<p>Although the foreign exchange market was still busy with settlement by major foreign banks yesterday, and Texaco also started absorbing, foreign banks such as HSBC continued to supply as much as possible. As a result, the underlying trend was extremely flat, and there were no changes. However, the June US dollar, due to aggressive settlement by Japanese banks and the unwillingness of Tianjin banks to sell cheaply, showed a slightly softened state. Transactions were lively throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong dollar, the situation became more stable due to the scarcity of supply and demand on both sides.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large bills showed a recent price of long 0.0625, and a forward premium of 0.0125. The US silver remained stable. London gold fell by half a penny. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was flat, the same as the exchange rate with Shanghai, and small for the French franc. The US dollar fell by 0.0625 against the British pound, but remained flat against Shanghai and unchanged against the French franc. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with a selling price of 8 and 25 cents for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, with no changes from the previous closing. After the opening, Japanese banks first mutually traded July British pounds at 8 and 234375 cents. Subsequently, Japanese banks aggressively settled foreign bank's beneficial (on behalf of Tianjin banks) June US dollars at 16 yuan, which showed a slightly softened state. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced at 2.5%, a levy of 5.25%. Afterwards, although foreign banks came to settle, foreign banks were still willing to supply, so the situation was quite stable. Foreign banks purchased HSBC's and Mercantile Bank's British pounds at 8 and 25 cents, and the oil company Texaco also settled US dollars with a certain bank at 16.0625 yuan. Later, Chinese banks mutually traded British pounds at 8 and 25 cents. As noon approached, transactions became clearer. However, the Hong Kong dollar slightly improved, with foreign bank Anda selling Hong Kong dollars to a foreign bank at 56 yuan. The situation was also flat. At the close, banks were selling British pounds at 8 and 25 cents, US dollars at 16.0625 yuan, and Hong Kong dollars at 56 yuan. As a result, there were no gains or losses for the British, American, and Hong Kong dollar compared to the previous night's closing. There was no market in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Notes are Cheaper than Drafts; Many Collect Them</h3>
<p>Yesterday, English pure gold fell by half a penny, and British and American exchange rates fell by 0.0625. Foreign exchange banks in the city were settling large amounts, and Japanese banks also had strong needs. Fortunately, the supply from foreign banks was smooth, and market prices remained stable as before. The spot gold market opened slightly soft, with gold shops and money exchanges having mutual supply and demand. The situation was swirling and slightly soft, and transactions were stagnant. The afternoon market was still sluggish, with weak customer buying interest. The closing trend was soft. Foreign currencies, such as British and American gold pounds, had relatively scarce supply and demand, and the changes were quite small. The need for British gold notes was not strong, but the trading of US dollar notes was quite active. Customers had a very smooth absorption and were numerous, likely collectors, because the market price was cheaper than drafts. The supply and demand for Hong Kong notes was still strong, and the price was stable. The need for Korean notes was very scarce, and the market value was increasingly cheap, only worth 8 jiao and 5 fen. There were not many association transactions, but the transaction amount was large. Chang Tai sold to Hong Chang ten British gold pounds, and Jin Da bought from it 3,500 yuan in US dollar notes. Xiang Kang sold to Cheng Tai 100 yuan in US dollar drafts, and Tong Feng sold to Cheng Tai 500 yuan in US dollar notes. Yesterday's market price showed a decrease of 5 fen for British gold pounds, an increase of 1 and 3 cents for British gold notes, an increase of 1 and 3 cents for US dollar notes, a decrease of 2 hao and 5 li for French franc notes, and a decrease of 5 fen for German gold notes. Other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Stabilized</h3>
<p>Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops by 1.4 Yuan</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) 19th Telegram: The exchange rate, compared with 2:30 PM on the 18th, saw a contraction of 0.0625 for the US dollar. The price of the British Shanghai exchange rate remained unchanged. As of 11:30 AM, the British and American Shanghai exchange rates showed no changes. There was no market in the afternoon. The morning's opening prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Large Bars Rise</h3>
<p>18th London Telegram: Mass and speculative buyers bought a small amount of silver. There was a lack of supply, and the market was flat. After the close, it was continuously flat. There were those who wanted to buy at the listed price, but those who were selling were watching. The recent price of large silver bars was long 0.0625, and the forward premium was minimal 0.0125. New York Telegram: US silver spot price was stable. Mumbai Telegram: Indian silver market was calm, and both the spot and futures prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>North China Legal Tender's Credit Rises Daily; Tianjin "Counterfeit Money" Falls Again</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 19th Telegram: The grey market price of counterfeit "United Reserve Bank Notes", compared with the morning opening on the 18th, continued to fall sharply by 7.5 yuan, with a price of 123.5 yuan (the price of 100 yuan of legal tender, that is, one yuan of "United Reserve Bank Notes" is only worth 8 jiao, 9 li, and 7 hao of legal tender).</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour Market Factory Prices Stabilize; Foreign Flour Prices Still Increasing; Japanese Merchants Continue to Handle Local Wheat</h3>
<p>Factory Flour: Yesterday's factory flour market continued to be stable. Second-grade flour merchants all temporarily held to the original price of 4.45 yuan, but merchant transactions gradually became sluggish. It is understood that since the Qingming Festival holiday, North China merchants have shipped out 302,500 bags of flour. It is also heard that new foreign flour has arrived there, so new transactions have been less enthusiastic. South China merchants have also shipped 73,400 bags of flour in the past two weeks, so they lack the intention to add to bulk transactions, only engaging in sporadic spot transactions. The total daily transactions amounted to more than 30,000 bags. It is also heard that there is a difference of 5 fen for the "Pao Che Pai" (Cannon Cart Brand) flour sold by North China merchants, and that the prices of various brands of returned goods on the market have also decreased by 2.5 to 5 fen, and the market prospects may change. It is found that yesterday's flour exports amounted to 20,000 bags, shipped to Quanzhou. Today's (20th) exports include 32,500 bags shipped to Tianjin, and 13,300 bags shipped to Shantou. Yesterday, 20,000 bags of bran were shipped to Quanzhou.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Yesterday's foreign flour market was particularly outstanding. According to overseas telegrams, recent rainfall has been low, reducing supply. Exports of American wheat have reached 10,963,000 bushels. In addition, the European situation is also causing the market to rebound, so the prices of foreign flour and wheat are consistently increasing. Forward orders have all become quiet. The supply of foreign flour on the market is also relatively scarce, because hoarders intend to sell at good prices, and merchants have not yet shipped out all the previous goods, so they lack the intention to add to the volume. Only local spot transactions, with transactions less than 10,000 bags. The "Lun Chuan Pai" (Steamer Brand) price requires 4.45 yuan per remittance. "Hong Ri Dang Tian Lao Pai" (Red Sun Same Day Old Brand) and "Hua Niao Bian Fu" (Flower Bird Bat) and other brands are feeling the lack of supply, so sellers are still increasing prices.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market saw only a few transactions. From the Yangtze River, 677 bags were newly transported from Xingang, and sporadic deliveries of Beijing-Zhenjiang wheat amounted to about 1,000 bags. Factory demand was flat, and merchants were not active. All intended to select high-quality goods, so the market showed no special signs. In the end, more than 300 bags of medium-grade Beijing-Zhenjiang wheat were traded at a price of 6.82 yuan. Due to quality reasons, the selling price was particularly low. It is heard that the goods were subsequently handled by Japanese merchants.</p>
<h3>Domi Rice Hoarders Wait and See; Merchants Lower Prices for Medium-Grade Rice</h3>
<p>The sources of Domi rice from various groups, there are fourteen or fifteen from He Xia, more than three thousand bags from Che Lun Bao Zi, Su Tong Kun and other groups. Although the arrival of goods seemed larger, sellers, seeing that the weather was still overcast, had firm intentions and held on to prices. However, sales were not good, and both local and hoarders were mostly waiting and watching, so most goods could not be sold, and the market showed a stable and soft situation. If the thick and thin japonica rice was already depreciated by a few fen, the Domi Yang Jian, Bu Jian, and Bian Yuan rice kept the original price with equal supply and demand.</p>
<p>Merchant: Although recent arrivals have been small, the market is ultimately tired due to weak sales. Yesterday, from Nanjing and Wuhu, about three thousand bags were transported by Che Lun through two routes. Merchants have displayed samples for sale, and each grade of medium and lower-grade rice is especially trying to lower prices and sell early, because the inventory of medium and lower-grade rice is relatively abundant, and it is easy to steam and mold after the weather is hot, so they are unwilling to shelve it for too long. However, merchant hoarders were still waiting and watching yesterday, and only more than 1,000 bags went to the local market. The market price showed a small increase of 6 to 7 fen for high-quality goods, and a decrease of about 1 jiao for medium and lower-grade goods.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Recover from Danger; Cotton Yarn Hoarders Seize the Opportunity to Cut Losses; 20-Count Yarn Fails to Move Forward with Coarse and Fine Yarns</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a stable state, but actual demand is not as strong as it used to be, so people's sentiment is slightly stable and in a state of hesitation. However, transactions along the Guangxi route are still substantial, transported from Guangzhou Bay, making the business of 20-count "Shuang Ma Te Jin Cheng" (Double Horse Special Golden City) more active. However, the absorption of the Yunnan group is slightly sluggish, and the Chaoshan group purchases and resells to the rear, so the market transactions can still be supported, and the market price is extremely peaceful. However, some hoarders, having experienced risk, held firmly when prices were low, never cutting losses, and have now recovered from danger, considering themselves satisfied and slightly profitable, and are seeking to sell in the market, so the market price is still hovering around 402-3 yuan. Whether new initiatives will be discovered in the future depends on actual sales to drive it. However, the price of 10-count yarn is steadily moving forward, and the market prices of 32-count and 42-count yarn are very high. If 20-count yarn maintains the current ratio, it could also support the rise. In the afternoon, traders and hoarders searched for them, which was extremely prosperous.</p>
<p>The current yarn situation shows that at the opening of the market in the early morning, Hong Kong merchants still had needs, but the purchases were less than the previous day, and the opening price remained the same. The price of 20-count "Shuang Ma" (Double Horse) yarn was 402 yuan, an increase of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. A short time later, Guangxi merchants also came to purchase, and the market showed an increasing trend, gradually rising to 403 yuan. Later, there was a slight unloading due to profitable bulls and the stagnation of business, resulting in a decline. By the closing, the price of 20-count "Shuang Ma" yarn was 401.5 yuan. Sales to merchants were good in the afternoon, and hoarders' absorption was even more fierce, causing the market price to rise. In the end, the total number of transactions throughout the day was 1,590 bales, and the market prices of 20-count "Shuang Ma" and "Tian Nv" (Fairy Maiden) were comparable to those of the previous day. The rising trend of 10-count yarn was very strong, and 32-count and 42-count yarn followed closely behind. The factory De Feng opened with 600 bales of 10-count "Shuang Shi" (Double Lion) at a price of 308 yuan, 400 bales of 80-count "Shuang Shi" at a price of 304 yuan, and 50 bales of 60-count "Jin Shuang Shi" (Golden Double Lion) at a price of 288.5 yuan, successively delivering goods. Yesterday, 20 pieces of yarn arrived from Hong Kong. Today's cotton yarn exports include 520 pieces transported to Tianjin, 340 pieces transported to Shantou, and 180 pieces transported to Hong Kong. The quotations of each group and the amounts of each count are listed on the left:</p>
<h3>The Subsidy Issue Still Lacks a Definite Solution; American Cotton Speculators Hastily Cover Short Positions; Market Prices Surge Sharply; Shanghai Trading Becomes Quiet</h3>
<p>The price of foreign cotton in the market, the New York analysis market, yesterday May rose another ten points; Shanghai manufacturers are deeply worried about the price of cotton rising again. It is not known the reason for the New York price increase at two o'clock, due to the approaching May delivery period, and previous colleagues' goods were released in anticipation of payments, thus the short position was extremely large. However, waiting for several days, daily rumors of released and export-subsidized cotton payments have persisted, yet there is still no definite solution. Thus, various short sellers are hastily covering their positions, causing the May price to surge twenty-five points in two days, July rising fourteen points, while new cotton from October onwards only rose three to five points. Recent European political turmoil and no increase in American cotton exports, coupled with difficulties in boosting fabric sales, are the primary reasons making it difficult for cotton prices to improve. Yesterday, India, including forecasts, fell half a rupee, Egypt rose more than ten points. Converted to legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton increased by eight jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by two jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by six jiao.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: various factories have been very quiet due to the rising prices of foreign cotton. Moreover, many goods arrive daily, so factories are more relaxed about ordering raw cotton. The converted factory price of yesterday's cotton market is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>The firmness of the yarn market is said to be due to too many fixed-quota sales, exceeding normal levels. Thus, foreign firms are unwilling to open, and the squeezing continues unabated. Although actual trading is not brisk, the market price is difficult to loosen. The current month's price for 20-count Phoenix yarn is 360 yuan.</p>
<p>The local cotton business shows slight activity, but the market trend is neither particularly prosperous nor declining. Chinese merchant Yong'an Factory bought 500 bales of bundled cotton, also for blending with Indian spun yarn. De Feng Factory handled 100 bales of raw yarn. It is found that the factory is selling 6-count, 10-count, and 8-count coarse yarn on the market, and the quantity has approached five or six thousand bales. It should be replenishing raw materials, but it is forced to buy Indian cotton as a substitute. In fact, because local cotton prices are high and cash is scarce, the future of the cotton market is in an awkward situation, with no exciting prospects. The supply from northern Jiangsu is as rare as morning stars; only 137 bales of Tong cotton arrived at the wharf. The situation of existing cotton is recorded on the left:</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea; Raw Silk Sets a New Record; the Highest Price in Nearly Ten Years; This City's Re-reeled Silk Follows with a 50 Yuan Increase</h3>
<p>The overseas silk price increase is very strong. Yokohama spot prices opened at 1,190 to 1,200 yuan, the highest price record in nearly ten years. The forward price is 1,094 yuan, an increase of 57 yuan and 47 yuan respectively. The New York silk market is striving to follow: raw silk 83 points rose 7 points, 75 points rose 8 points, Shanghai silk 78 points rose 7 points. The recent standard silk opened at 2.43 yuan, proving the previous day's telegram transmission of 2.26 yuan was an error for 2.36 yuan, thus it also rose by 7 points. The forward price rose 7.5 points. The Japanese and American silk markets are almost in a white-hot state. New York City's silk transaction volume reached 2,270 bales, and the robust situation can be seen generally. However, this afternoon, Yokohama closed, except for this month's recent gains of 5 yuan, all other goods from spot to futures for each month have fallen back, with the spot price falling 10 yuan and the forward price falling 25 yuan.</p>
<p>The local silk market seemed more chaotic yesterday. Since Japan and the United States announced a surge in prices, which seemed to have no end, people were surprised, delighted, and suspicious, with no consensus. This caused the white filature silk transaction to turn sluggish and wait-and-see. Most transactions were for purchases ordered by foreign firms based on telegrams sent the previous day. 7/8-grade white filature rose 20-30 yuan yesterday, and re-reeled silk from six companies, Qilin horse-racing grade, rose 50 yuan. It is estimated that 50 bales of white filature and 90 bales of re-reeled silk were traded. The price for B-grade white filature in the user silk market was 1,600 yuan. Because buyers had little interest in buying, the silk price seemed difficult to rise quickly. The market price for dried cocoons opened and had already risen to 440 yuan, a rise of 30 yuan from the previous week. Therefore, the silk capital will be raised to above 1,650 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 19th, 100 tons of tea for export were shipped to Europe; on the 20th, another 84 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, 17 pieces to Qingdao, and 18 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake; Rumors of Over a Thousand Barrels of Oil Arriving Daily; Prices Plunge by One Yuan; Raw Oil Also Expected to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no market for peanut oil buying and selling. It is feared that prices will have to fall because the sources are not connecting. In addition to various other oils arriving one after another, rumors circulated in the market yesterday that over a thousand barrels would arrive daily, causing people to panic, reducing appetite, and the market turned downward. The rare price increase came to an abrupt end. Dalian spot oil fell by one yuan, with 150 barrels traded, the price falling from 44.5 yuan to 44 yuan. Another 50-odd barrels of road goods were priced at 43.8 yuan. Only 100 pieces of Dalian large-basket oil were traded, the price falling from 42.5 yuan to 42 yuan, rebounding by two jiao at closing to 42.2 yuan. One hundred pieces of Jiaozhou oil from road goods were opened, priced at 32 yuan.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports; Another 2,000 Fresh Eggs Arrive; Exports Include Egg Yolk, Egg White, and Intestines</h3>
<p>Fresh eggs are arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream. On the 18th, 2,040 pieces arrived from Xingang; on the 19th, another 250 pieces arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<p>Exported goods: on the 18th, 1,000 tons of egg yolk and egg white were shipped to London; on the 19th, 100 tons of [text missing] cloth were shipped to Germany; 25 pieces of pig intestines were shipped to Europe.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market; Broken Green Sugar is Cheap; The Price Surge of Foreign Sugar Has Already [text missing]</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price surge of foreign sugar had already [text missing]. The guild allocated the plate, and No. 24 coarse white sugar and Taikoo cart white sugar were all at the original price, with few transactions. The near-term May-June futures of coarse white sugar were at 5.45 Dutch guilders (per dan), with 2,000 bags traded. The far-term September-October futures were at 5.25 Dutch guilders, with 2,000 bags opened. Among domestic sugars, the Guangdong merchant opened 250 bags of Shimen broken green sugar, with a relatively poor quality and a price of 11 yuan. The Jiangnan merchant opened a hundred-odd bags of ordinary Diao green sugar, at 13.3 yuan. The Chaozhou merchant opened genuine cotton red sugar at 15.5 yuan. On the 18th, 1,920 bags of sugar arrived from Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods; Fuzhou Merchants Telegraph to Stop Loading; Actual Sales in Sichuan and Yunnan Turn Sluggish Again; Signs of a Price Surge in Coarse Cloth Are Already Visible</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>The sales plate for bleached and dyed fabrics is stable, and the actual needs of the Nanhua merchants are turning sluggish. Because the Yunnan-Guizhou mail parcels, which had been suspended for 40 days, were only restored on the 17th, the mail is extremely congested. It is heard that receipt and dispatch will be temporarily suspended again, so the purchase of goods for dressing up must be postponed again. Transactions are turning clear, and the delivery of goods already purchased is still strong. The Fuzhou merchants are deeply wary of Japanese warships intercepting and detaining ships. On the night of the 18th, they telegraphed to stop handling all goods, and those already handled will be loaded slowly. Only the Guangdong Shantou and Leizhou ports have better appetite, with 6,000-odd pieces of colored cloth, twill bleached cloth, and lustring traded. The sales trend of white cloth and fine cloth is firm. Fine cloth has risen by 5-10 fen, and Dapeng brand has risen by 5 fen. Spot sales are open at 13.75 yuan, and 30-50 bales of forward May-June goods are open for sale at 14 yuan. The sales plate for fine twill has risen by about 1 jiao. Dye factories and outside investors are the most active traders, with a total of over 300 bales traded. Coarse cloth and coarse twill have been absorbed by hoarding, and with the support of actual sales, a price surge has been triggered. 600-odd bales have been traded by merchants in this street and the Wenzhou-Taizhou merchants in eastern Zhejiang, with Yihua goods accounting for the largest share. The sales plate for Yihua coarse cloth is out of stock and has risen by 5-10 fen. The inventory of Dasheng Factory coarse cloth is running low, and the market price has surged. 16-pound Kuizi Blue Lion has risen by 3 jiao per piece.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, actual sales were cleared, and the sales plate for fine cloth and fine twill were mediocre. However, there were still 7-800 pieces traded by merchants in this street buying and selling each other. Only the Qingdao merchants bought 200-odd bales of 12-pound colored ball fine cloth, with a price of about 13.2 yuan per piece. The firm did not open goods, and the broadcloth and serge on the market are still extremely popular. The market price for Four Gentlemen broadcloth has exceeded 4 jiao 5.5 fen per yard. Piece goods exports today: 145 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 170 pieces to Yantai, 300 pieces to Shantou, and 125 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>The Honor of Xue Li Hong (Pickled Mustard Greens)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Xue Li Hong (also written Xue Li Hong, abbreviated as Xue Cai, or snow vegetable) in cuisine can be said to be the most common side dish, because it is cheap and delicious, so it is often included in Ms. Hua Ying's economic menu in this magazine, such as Xue Cai fried tofu, Xue Cai braised yellow croaker, etc. In meat dishes, adding a little of it will surely enhance the flavor. It is just like licorice in Chinese medicine, which is useful everywhere.</p>
<p>According to recent news reports from Singapore, China's Xue Li Hong (pickled vegetables) has recently been shipped to London, England, for the first time. After being tested by British physicians, it was found that this vegetable contains a large amount of vitamins and is very nutritious, and was crowned with the beautiful name of "Life Vegetable." This also shows that tastes are shared, regardless of China or foreign countries. China has opened up a new source of profit for vegetable sales overseas and has gained praise from people in foreign lands, which can be regarded as an honor!</p>
<p>According to the Ci Yuan dictionary: "Xue Li Hong is a vegetable plant with sharp serrated and notched leaves, similar to mustard greens, but the leaves are slightly textured and the flowers are yellow. When other vegetables are damaged by frost in snowy weather, this vegetable alone remains green, hence the name. The taste is slightly spicy and is often pickled as a side dish. Northerners call it Chun Bu Lao (Never Old in Spring). According to the Tang Yun dictionary, the vegetable core is long, white, and red." Based on this, since it overwinters and grows in the snow, its nature may be similar to that of peas and is mature in nature, but this still needs to be confirmed with doctors and pharmacists.</p>
<p>Some people also call Xue Li Hong Yan Zha Cai (salt pickled vegetable). There is a story about this: "When Song Fan Wenzheng Gong (Zhongyan) was young, he was poor and studied in a Changbai monastery. He boiled two liters of millet and made a bowl of porridge, which solidified overnight. He cut it into four pieces with a knife, and ate two pieces every morning and evening, breaking off dozens of stems of pickled vegetables to eat with it." From this, we can know that the spirit of diligence and self-motivation of ancient sages is worthy of emulation by later generations.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that those who make Xue Li Hong will not make it crudely and carelessly just because it sells well overseas. They should strive for improvement. While production should be increased, they should also pay attention to the deliciousness of the taste, so that they can maintain the sales in the overseas market for a long time.</p>
<h3>About Giving Up Seats on the Tram</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Sitting in a tram and seeing a woman get on, because it is crowded and she cannot find a seat, you give up your seat to her. Everyone knows that this is so-called Western civilization. However, since this Western civilization was introduced to China, we often see Chinese people giving up their seats to foreign wives on the tram, but rarely see Westerners giving up their seats to Chinese women. Perhaps foreigners' so-called civilized etiquette has different distinctions, and on the other hand, it can also be seen how they view Chinese people.</p>
<p>In the tram, giving up seats is not limited to women. Seeing the elderly and children, you should also give up your seats to them. However, most Chinese people only know how to give up seats to women, but do not know how to give up seats to the elderly and young. Moreover, even among women, some people will only choose those who are well-dressed and beautiful to give up seats to, while women who are simply dressed and ugly are ignored even if they are standing in front of them. In fact, trams do not care about clothing and appearance. All women must be given seats, especially those who are carrying or holding children in their hands. You must give up seats to them even faster.</p>
<p>Seeing women, you should indeed give up seats. Seeing the elderly and children, you should also give up seats to them. But in my opinion, the scope of giving up seats on trams should not be limited to this. Even if a man is holding a child in his hand and cannot find a seat, you should also give up your seat to him. Also, if someone is carrying seven bags and eight bundles, and is unable to bear the weight, and gets on the tram but cannot find a seat, regardless of whether they are male or female, you should also give up your seat to them. Sometimes, when we are on the tram, we see villagers who rarely come to Shanghai getting on. They cannot find a seat and, because they rarely ride trams, they stand in the tram swaying from side to side, as if they are about to fall. We should also give up seats to these people who cannot stand in the tram. If we can do this, the meaning of giving up seats will be broader and more accurate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, whether they are the elderly or women, if someone gives up their seat to them, some people sit down and thank them with a smile as a sign of gratitude, but there are also those who sit down impolitely and ignore you, as if it is their due. In fact, it is a courtesy for someone to give you a seat. This is not a right that you are entitled to. It is only because someone is giving it to you from a perspective of sympathy. Then, if someone treats you politely, you should reciprocate with politeness. Although the person giving up the seat does not necessarily need to exchange your thanks, it is essential for the person being given the seat to thank them with a smile in order to show that you have manners. You must not have the mindset that they should give you a seat and ignore them. This point should also be known.</p>
<h3>A Prediction of "Housing" in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Cang Qi</p>
<h3>Method for Improving Edible Salt</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Edible salt is a daily necessity for life. Whether consumed directly or indirectly, each person needs at least three qian per day. This is an ancient Chinese saying. Even physiologists say that each person needs at least 15 to 18 pounds of edible salt per year. In that case, ten pounds of salt per month is enough for a family of eight. It is entirely possible to make your own physiological saline to achieve perfection. The method is very simple and does not require mechanical equipment. Ordinary enameled basins are good tools. First, dissolve crude salt in five times its weight of water (that is, dissolve one pound of salt in four pounds of water). Then you will see that it is as dirty as mud. After standing for a while, wait for the mud to settle, and scoop the clear liquid into a magnetic basin. Separately, dissolve soda ash in five times its weight of water (soda ash is sodium carbonate, or you can use local alkali). Slowly add it to the salt water mentioned above, creating a good cloud-like condensate until no more clouds form. (The amount added varies depending on the salt produced in different places, generally as much as 20% or as little as 3%, be sure to stir it evenly. After that, filter a little of the clear liquid and try adding alkali liquid again, to the extent that no more clouds form.) Then use a cloth to filter out the sediment. Then add a little barium chloride solution to the clear liquid, also until no more clouds form. (Barium chloride can be purchased from Western pharmacies and also dissolved in 20 times its weight of water.) Then filter the clear liquid to remove the residue and put it in a magnetic basin. Dry it by boiling on the stove (stir constantly when dissolving and shrinking to prevent it from sticking to the bottom), then place it on a brick and spread it out to dry into a powder. It will be as white as snow and taste extremely delicious, even purer than commercially sold refined salt. This is the physiological saline sold in Western pharmacies. Shanghai needs to sell it for eight jiao per pound, but it is still not as pure. To test its purity, use its saline solution and test it with the above two items. If adding alkali water produces clouds, it is evidence that it contains calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate. If adding barium chloride produces clouds, it is evidence that it contains potassium and sodium sulfate. Potassium sulfate can treat obesity, so it can make people lose weight. If edible salt contains potassium salt, the accumulation will gradually reduce appetite, and vitality will be greatly affected. Vegetarians often become thin and withered like firewood because the potassium in plant-based foods can eliminate fat, and they cannot obtain pure green sodium to exchange for it. Moreover, crude salt contains even more sulfates, which can make matters worse. Therefore, I believe that the need for physiological saline in the home cannot be ignored. As the method mentioned above is very easy to operate, once a month is enough to make it for the entire month. Compared to washing rice and vegetables, which require daily arrangements, the complexity is incomparable. As for the cost, it is minimal. If the fuel used is wood instead of coal, you can also extract alkali from the wood ash yourself. But if it is pine wood, if the ash soaked in water does not feel slippery to the touch, then do not extract alkali. Now the price of alkali is extremely high, and residents in the inland can collect ash and make alkali everywhere, but because they are limited by the scope of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, it is inconvenient to include it in this article. Or perhaps I can write another article on the problem of clothing washing to contribute how.</p>
<h3>Monday Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Eggs are an excellent food for nourishing the body, and they are very rich in vitamins. There are many ways to prepare them, and it is really impossible to describe them all. In home cooking, such as poached eggs and egg drop soup, we can often eat them. When whitebait is on the market in spring, this fried whitebait with eggs is a very good seasonal dish. Whitebait, commonly known as noodles, has no taste when cooked alone and must be fried with eggs. Some chives sprouts must also be added to complement each other. In addition, there is another dish that also uses eggs. It is called egg skin with shredded meat and mixed with chives sprouts. Beat the egg yolks and whites together, spread them in an oiled pot to make egg skin, cut them into thick strips, then add boiled shredded meat and bamboo shoots, soaked chives sprouts, add soy sauce and sesame oil and mix. It tastes very refreshing. If you don't like to eat chives sprouts, then you can substitute water celery or mung bean sprouts. If you want to eat something more elaborate, then don't use shredded meat, just use shredded chicken and shredded ham, which is also not impossible.</p>
