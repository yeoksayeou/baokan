<h3 id="c4">日本破壞中國沿海航業問題 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>排斥歐美各國在華勢力，乃是日本建立所謂「東亞新秩序」的重要工作之一；就以歐美各國在華航業一項而言，曾經歐美各國交涉多時的長江珠江通航問題，迄今尙未獲得圓滿解決；而最近日本對於歐美各國在華的沿海航業，又加緊施行武力干涉。在最近幾天之內、浙海洋面有葡國商輪九艘，被日艦扣留，迫駛上海；又英輪西格士號，於由厦門赴福州途中，亦被日艦扣留，迫駛台灣，日本干涉歐美在華沿海航業，並非始於最近；惟最近日本大批扣留英葡商輪，顯係表示對於歐美在華沿海航業，又有較干涉更進一步的企圖了。</p>
<p>日本自發動侵華戰爭以來，就實行對中國海上封鎖，但是她却沒有斷絕中國沿海各埠間的交通。日本這種不澈底的封鎖，一方面固然是怕引起第三方面的干涉；同時她還有一種經濟上的企圖，那就是利用各港埠間的航業交道，使大量日貨仍得輾轉運銷內地，許多日本戰時所需要的原料，也可以同樣的方法從中國內地取得，以致戰後的中日貿易，反較戰前允爲繁榮。可是現在事過境遷，對於第三方面的干涉，事實上已不成爲問題：日本封鎖長江珠江交通，歐美各國僅祇提出無效的抗議；上月日本禁止歐美商輪在長江下游江北各港口間航行，歐美各國也沒有什麼實際的表示。日本預料爲統制中國航業計，對於歐美在華沿海航業加以破壊，也不會引起歐美各國的干涉。至於日本利用中國沿海航業所從事的間接貿易，因爲中國政府統制對外貿易的日趨嚴格，現在已不像從前那樣容易。日本在經濟陰謀上失敗之後，爲澈底封鎖中國海上交通計，破壊歐美各國在華的沿海航業，乃成爲日本所必然的一種侵略行動。</p>
<p>日本最近扣留歐美各國商輪的理由，據海軍方面表示爲：（一）各輪裝載華方游擊隊；（二）爲華方裝載軍械；（三）各輪國籍不明。這三個理由，實際上也祗是居心破壊歐美在華沿海航業的一種藉口，就第一二兩個理由來說，日本這次在浙海洋面所扣留葡國商輪九艘，扣留已經數日，檢査已經多决，試問日本發現眞正的游擊隊有幾人？軍械又有多少？退一步說，歐美商輪果眞如日本所說，載有華方游擊隊與軍械；可是日本既未與中國宣戰，她能根據國際法中那一條欵，可以禁止歐美商輪的自由載客與載貨？若謂船隻的國籍不明，這些船隻在沿海航行已久，日本爲什麼在事先不向在華各歐美外交機關詳細調査？必須在海洋中加以扣留？並且如果被扣留的歐美商輪，眞正是冒籍華輪，英艦與葡領當不會向日方提出抗議。英艦與葡領既已提出抗議，這就足以證明確屬英葡的船隻；而日本却置英艦和葡領的抗議於不顧；日本顯然的認英艦與葡領幫助華船冒籍，這對英葡便不啻一種重大的侮辱！</p>
<p>在目前中日戰爭期內、日本對於歐美在華沿海航業的破壞，實際歐美人士所受損失很是有限；不過從這裏却可看到日本根除在華歐美勢力的決心；更可以看到日本所有的保證，毫無一絲一毫的價値。日昨日首相平沼尙在所謂「興亞院」中演說，謂日本并無干涉第三方面在遠東權益的意念，但以不危及日本國防利權爲限。那麼這决日艦扣留歐美商輪，還不算干涉第三方面的權益嗎？難道這决被扣英葡商輪，對於日本國防又有什麼損害嗎？歐美各國要保全她們在華所殘存的一點權益，祗有實際的行動才是最有效的方法。過去英美各國曾經試行以在華軍艦保護商船自由通航，現在應即推而廣之，如過去地中海的英法軍艦分劃防區辦法，分別派艦以保障商船的自由航行，不受干涉，以保權益。吾則不要說長江珠江的通航永久無望，就是沿海航業，恐怕以後也就難以保持了！</p>

<p>桂林通信、近有來自武漢經過游擊區之友人、到達此間、據稱他是三月七日離開漢口的法租界、一共五人、一共走了十五天的路程、他報告了許多武漢淪陷後的情形、現在摘要的記在下面、</p>
<p>日人建築工事　敵人　是在十二月　二十六　日的拂曉、侵入武漢的、在十二月廿六日的清晨、武漢的同胞沒有料到敵人就會很快的進攻到武漢來、只到二十六日的清晨、江面遠遠的槍聲、敵人的兵艦五六十艘從長江　下游駛上、兵艦的前面是小汽艇、天空是大量的驅逐機低飛掃射着掩護兵艦前進、日本軍官士兵、威風的站立在船頭、一律穿的黃色制服、到下午就登岸了、</p>
<p>我們的毀壞工作、還做得不夠、敵人很快地將廣播電臺·水電廠·恢復了、沿江邊我們從前　做的工事、敵人便利用舊形勢在上面加上極厚的鋼板、築得非常堅固、防備我們日後反攻用的、</p>
<p>鐵蹄下的侵佔　關於　武漢市　面的情形、漢口方面、特一二三區、敵人劃為商業區、模範區劃為軍事區、這三區只准住日本人　民生路一帶劃　為日華區、中國人可以居住、日租界一帶為怕游擊隊躲藏、全燒光了、他們利用過去的商店、像沿中山馬路一帶的商店、原先是做甚麼生意的、現在依然由日本人經營、</p>
<p>武漢現在的生活程度、是極端昂貴、租界內米每担售價二十元、炭每担售價十六元、小菜蘿　一塊錢兩個、其餘日用生法品、更貴不可言、中國法幣一元二角、換日本軍用手票一元、日貨在武漢暢銷、是不必說的了、日本罐頭、則非常便宜、一塊錢可以買五盒、蘋果之類、一塊錢可以買十個、其了如綢緞·花布·藥品·鐘表·都散佈在各個店舖裏、</p>
<p>法租界已屈服　日軍將　入武漢之初、法租界　當局態度、還相當強硬、後來日軍對法租界實行封鎖、法租界當局只得節節讓步了、到現在、日軍憲兵隨時在租界拘捕行人、在法租界的柵門口有安南士兵守着、不准任何食物運進租界、如發現有行人帶糧食進租界去、則將這個罰跪地上、將糧食頂在頭頂、一整天不准起來、</p>
<p>因為租界被封鎖、租界內十餘萬居民、不易生活、困難萬分、大家只得搬了出來、可是日當局十二月規定了每人得以三元至五元之日金、購買「安居證」、方可回到你原來的住處、路上行人來往、每次遇見了日本士兵、必須誠意的恭敬的向他行九十度的鞠躬禮、否則就橫施鞭撻、就是你鞠躬時、態度上有點使他們不滿意的地方、也免不掉一頓毒打、一次有一個剃光頭的行人、向日本士兵面前過、日本士兵就任意的用刺刀在他頭上摸弄取笑、</p>
<p>民衆不斷抵抗　漢口的　電報管理局、現在變　為敵軍的憲兵偵探、遍地皆是、每一個旅館、每一個里弄、教住着有日本便衣警探、最可恨的、現在為敵人作情報工作的人、居然有過去在武漢參加救亡工作的人、他們隨時隨地的幫助敵人打探、以致現在留在武漢的一部份工作同志、時刻都受他們的監視、一不留意、很快的就得被捕了、</p>
<p>我們在武漢的秘密工作、也做得相當的好、街面上的傳單、牆壁上的標語、時常可以發現、像「否認僞組織、擁護委員長抗戰到底」這類標語、在僞維持會成立的那一天早上、就在街頭牆壁上發現了、雖經日當局僞走狗的塗抹、但一下雨、馬上標語又出現了、是永遠擦不掉的痕跡、（未完）</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師著</p>
<p>現代男女間的配偶，實生存於無窮的互相依恃之中，其相互關係，較諸原始人民之兩性生活，實已不可相提並論。蓋現代人之性生活，完全基於互愛及禮教控制這下矣，凡一切殘暴，嫉妬，污濁，恐怖與淫猥，凡起自性慾的物質方面之不當的作用者，皆可為配偶生活之高尚形態所完全掃除，人生之活潑而幸福，其有賴於兩性份子的雙變結合。及其互相提高與促進，實已鐵律如山。倘於愛情生活中的雙變融合所含有的一切優美的潛能，果能充分了解之，則必無人願逃於獨身的禁慾主義之中！惜乎世人尚有漠視此說，對兩性融和一點，不能充分發揮其效融，同時對於性的健康，又不能嚴格遵守一夫一妻制，致斵傷而衰弱，影響及於愛情者，實覺難以佔計。</p>
<p>愛情對於性能健康之關係旣如上述，然用怎樣方法能使此機能充分健康而幸神呢？一言以蔽之，須在婚前珍惜貞操，切忌荒淫與自　，要知吾人有別於原始人之性生活者，完全倡行貞操觀念所致，茍無貞操，則人盡可夫，荒淫污濁，不可遏制，故婚前荒淫之人，每易釀成病症，而使腦神經亦極度衰弱。脊髓神經同現病態，此後健忘夫眠，頭痛昏眩，精神不振，腎虧早洩，腰酸背痛等症，亦隨而爆發矣。</p>
<p>以外之早婚及多妻，也是使以身殉國人消失的重要原因，故善於衛生之人，必重視其精液，不肯從慾而斵傷，蓋一點一滴的精血，均屬夫婦間愛情的重要原料，故凡有上述毛病的人，應趕快從增精補血着手，服以　丸內分泌劑。不衹是為了補充因從慾所顯的精血虧弱，實是為了促進健康這故，基於此種意義來看，施行　丸內分泌製劑男用「補體康」內服之後。　丸產生精細胞的作用活潑，新的精血就可源源產生，不論任何一個患者，一經「補體康」治療，廿四小時，即顯驚人卓效，使妻子得到無上的安慰，此時妻衷心的愉快，實覺難以形容，世界上有不少失和的夫婦，服「補體康」具有調經種子之功。從此活潑而幸福的人生乃開始矣。</p>

<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>肺病為何難治，因肺結核菌外面蒙有蠟質，富有抗酸性。故任何內服藥均不能脫去其蠟，惟僅有增進營養之功耳，所以奏效殊為不確。自德國徒梅博士。採用最新學理，配製各種礦植物成分而製成「補肺拿爾」一藥後，對於肺病治療，始有長足進少，本劑之特效，及增強抵抗力，以解除結核菌之武裝——蠟質，於是凶暴無比之肺結核菌，遂無其立足地而完全肅清]故不論如何難治之肺病，如服「補肺拿爾」。無不澈底根治，他如小兒之百日咳，老年哮喘，及一切流行性感冒，久咳痰多，服之均有良效。</p>
<h3 id="c38">治療遺精必須注意攝生 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭霆</p>
<p>在神經衰弱症候中，有所謂遺精一症，患此者非常之多，尤其在剛步入成人時代的青年，幾乎難免。其病勢劇烈者，往往白盡間，因此微刺戰，亦能將精液滑出，故名之為滑精，其情形尤為嚴重。</p>
<p>關於遺精的治法，選擇有效的藥劑以鞏固精關，固屬扼要，但若不注意攝生，或有自　行為，雖服大量的藥，可說依然無效，故此時患者應清心寡慾，擯絕淫念，多瀏覧高尚的書籍，從事運動，戒除煙酒，睡前尤須注意排尿，因遺精是神經衰弱的一個證候，故施以神經衰弱症的療法絕對必要，服雄壯動物　丸精質製劑男用「補體康」每日三次，每次三片，並在睡前兼服「耐而斯遺精片」三片，不僅遺精能夠完全根治，而對於遺精所引起之發育不全，未老先衰，腰酸背痛，食慾不振等症，都能在短期內一一治好。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌博士</p>
<p>化學療法對於治淋上確有相當貢獻，但並非絕對的有效。因為此等療法，對於千變萬的淋病，決難包括治愈。例如現在市上所流行之化學療法，有宜於急性淋者，有宜於慢性淋者，欲求全能之治療，迄未一見。蓋此非藥之治療，而實為勢所不能也。關於此種原因，歐美各國醫家，業已有透徹之論及，母庸螯辭。</p>
<p>現在又為一般人所注意者，厥為非特異性療法，此療法之發明，較之一般化學療法，確有超特之點，即非特異性療法，能增加白血球　菌機能，故能勝過一般之化學療法為根據的淋藥。</p>
<p>德國淋病學大師彼博士，為淋病學上之巨人，其對於淋藥這發明上，亦具有三十餘年之研究。根據非物異性療法，作進一步之研究，結果大有所獲，博士採用特種之蛋白體黃色索混合製成。旣先經動物試騐，復經各國著名醫家作臨床試騐，經過着着改良，結果須於發明淋病特效藥「克淋儂」一藥，為舉世各國專家所推獎。各國臨床家對本劑之推揚備至。</p>
<p>就余之經騐而論，余對於淋病在未有「克淋儂」一藥發明之前，殊感到辣手。惟自「克淋儂」一藥發明之後，已感到大為便利。凡爭慢性攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，膀胱炎，關節炎等雖曾經談用化學療法所不愈者，改服「克淋儂」而遠全根治。一方並用「抗淋水」作尿道之洗滌，女子淋毒白帶，可外用「卡而雪地陰道處」為坐藥，每天按圖及說明書在家自療，功效尤勝，百發百中。絕無失敗之例。</p>

<p>睪丸一物，吾輩皆知其為製造精子之重要器官，春關於吾人之生存可知，惟可惡之淋病，卻每乘人不備，攻進此種生殖重要之堡壘，至人生機能失去，殊屬可怕。是以吾人不可不趕速治療淋毒性睪丸炎，實無庸躊躇者也。否則，淋毒愈演愈烈，勢將蔓延而不可以收拾，余臨床二十年，茍患者之硬丸未至十分硬化，則尚有補之道。下列一例，即其明證，讀者可注意之！</p>
<p>患者李叔春君，年二十四歲，蘇之溧陽人，商界，彼於二年前，沾染淋病，曾一度傷性自愈，次年因其老母抱孫心切，囑其返里完婚，蓋是李君在滬，猶一獨身者，旣而受室之後，度其蜜月生涯，其樂融融，顧旦旦而伐之，舊毒　復大作，因淋菌侵犯，致發睪丸炎，睪丸腫大，疼痛異常，行動中跚蹣，坐外有如重物下垂，久治不愈，將趨硬化，幸由朱竹君之介紹，來余處治療，經余採用科學方法檢醒後，診斷為淋毒性副睪丸炎，且內部似有化膿之趨勢。乃急投以淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，使其發生一種抗淋唑菌之特殊效騐，一方復用德國靜電療法，及X線電療，並令病家家靜。為此治療前後不過五星期，徹底全部治愈。後又用科學方法血清檢查，證明絕無淋毒反應云　自即日起每天送診二十號，每號僅取號金五角。</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况堪稱堅穩、漲勢甚微而不勁、一般浮多搶帽子交易、隨市出籠、而吃戶較稀、致市價暫時安定而穩、大戶多頭始終不放手因環境方在醞釀、一旦倘有和平確實消息、連帶交易所必行開市、彼時行市必有在漲、昨日經過、開盤時，甲種爲永康收買、乙種爲四號吸收、其他各種則爲大豐及二十二號買進、出乙進丁、希望中籤、則爲天生三十五號及同康松茂、均有賣出、午後交易甚淸、買賣雙方均不甚踴躍、大都仍爲多方佔優勢、結果續好五分一角至三角半、成交總數共計六十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月十一日（星期二）掛牌行市、各債漲跌參差不一、費克斯飛機債票上升一鎊價爲十七鎊、津浦鐵路原續發各債票各升半鎊、價各爲十七鎊半、英德續借款英發債票及中法美金五釐公債有印債票、各跌半鎊、前者價爲六十八鎊、後者價爲六十四鎊半、又六日行市廣九鐵路公債回升五先令、查係原報吿刊誤、應予更正、其餘各種、則無變動、英倫實貨供給、計英金善後公債英發債票二千鎊、售價五十一鎊十五先令、照市抬五先令、又德發有印債票三千鎊、售價四十七錢十五先令、照英發價撳三鎊十五先令、津浦鐵路續發公債英發債粟二千鎊、售價十八鎊五先令、照市抬十五先令、</p>
<p>股票市面、倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月十一日（星期二）掛牌行市、續見跌落、麥加利銀行股回跌二先令六辨士、價爲八鎊、滙豐銀行股各跌半鎊、英倫註册股跌至八十二鎊半、香港註册股跌至八十四鎊半、開平煤礦股回跌六辨士、價爲十七先令六辨士、古拉客林傍橡皮股跌落七辨士半、價爲十六先令十辨士半、叉六日報吿上海自來水A種股跌落五先令、查係原報告刊誤、應予更正、其餘均無變動、</p>
<p>上海衆業公所報吿股市情况淸淡、價格稍形低落、持戶縮手旁觀、而新買戶亦缺少、因爲明知此後國際局勢仍飄　不定、怡和股無大更動、在二十元價之間盤旋、耶松船塢股成交價一百元、橡皮原料價稍跌、意料美政府此次擬以棉麥交換英國及嗬囒之橡皮與錫、則橡皮用戶當因此而停購、在各方亦有劇烈宜傳謂增加橡皮出產、如此則原料市面當有不佳氣象、但此說現今無從證實、若使實行此舉、想本埠各橡皮股票當不致受影響、因出產加多、其價雖欲降低少許、然各公司原料出產增加、所售得之利益較多、上週英國橡皮存底减少一千三百噸之多、</p>
<p>證券市塲成交閘北水電股五十股、價爲六元四角、</p>
<h3 id="c48">紗花　存底單薄　十支粗紗漲勢獨强　申新廠續開天女二千包 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>紗市仍在穩定之境、但二十支紗因廠方生產既增進、而存貨較旺、故近來華南一帶滇港潮汕等處之需要、日見起色、且辦量宏大、市價當有扶搖直上之勢、無奈執貨者衆、吿不存扳價觀念、隨潮流而駛、市盤之漲風因之迂迥前進、惟十支粗紗原料缺乏、而各廠出數减縮、存底單薄廠方大致無存積、售價脫難細紗、乃邁步前進、至三二支單紗及四二支雙股綫價亦係現貨缺少、情况安謐如恒、紗市就大勢觀測、暫時仍不脫徘徊之象、午後香港帮交易仍健、叉復回昂矣、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、市塲益覺熱閙、且氣象仍緊俏、緣客銷良好、故各貨售價喊高一步、二十支雙馬。天女開價加一元、四二支錢價隨需要旺盛而續升、十支粗紗天津帮吃胃既健、而雲南帮亦步塵於後、廠方之額子皆被其搜羅殆盡矣、迨至收盤時、二十支雙馬紗因根子鬆懈、價高則大家爭售、又復回挫、收盤價雙馬爲三百九十元、午後開盤、以實需不弱、市狀帶昂、二十支雙馬現紗價漲二元、爲三百九十二元、結果全日各部買去統計一千五百六十三包、上日午後成交二百四十包、合計一千八百零三包、行情二十支天女雙馬與上日價不相上下、惟十支粗紗獨漲三四元不等、三十二支及四二支平平、廠方由申新二廠開出二十支天女二十包、價爲三百八十九元、四月至九月期、永安廠開出二十支特金城一百六十包、價爲四百元、新裕廠開出十支雙地球一百包、價爲三百零八元、十六支雙地球五十包、價爲三百七十元至七十一元、今日出口棉紗七百五十件、運天津、一百八十件運烟台、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>天津　二九〇　汕頭　三〇</p>

<p>日紗市面、因實需停滯、竟星有行無市、惟下月份輸贏交易、異常熱鬧、進口紛繁、市價時有升降、結果二十支水月現紗價爲三百五十九元至六十元、二十支藍鳳現紗價三百五十六元、比上日漲二三元云、</p>

<p>本棉生意之淸淡、形同停頓、蓋以各路來源中斷、浙棉受封江影響、難以外運、專靠蘇北一路稍有來貨、然額量日見减縮、至於廠方、雖有下手動辦之念、然亦無貨可暢進、於是遂成一片荒凉氣象、有一部份廠商目標、移注在外棉上着想、然印棉品質欠佳、廠方極不願購訂、然處此環境之下、非採外棉補救、不足以調劑矣、故動辦美棉爲多、碼頭上到通州花僅四百八十包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市仍無起色、華盛頓方面、尙無關於棉業問題之文件發表、昨日盛傳美政府擬計劃提用貸款棉五百萬包、作掉換橡皮六十萬噸之說、但此說未能證實、若能實行、棉價或有轉機之可能也、昨日紐的跌一至四磅音、印度連同預測跌半羅比、埃及平平、昨日滙兌較前未有變動、折合法幣、棉價計美棉及巴西棉每担跌二角、印棉跌二角、埃及棉略漲四角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、連日紗價較形活躍、棉市因此略有轉機之狀、故日來稍有零星交易、唯大批訂購、尙有待也、數日來因粗紗暢銷、故各廠所購之原棉、大致均以短纖維者爲多、昨日計有申新進印棉一千包、合豐進美棉五百包、安達進印棉二百包、茲將昨日棉市、折合送廠價錄下、</p>

<p>昨豆油大漲小回、由於連油來源、仍未絕跡、似爲日商前「臺」之信泰暗中有售出、且外商魯麟洋行等亦有出售之說、三月份下期、亦可解交、以致人心下挫、但各路辦胃集中滬地、故有杯水車薪之槪、昨大連桶油共成交四百餘桶、價自四十二元五角開盤、結果四十一元三角五分、收盤連歧大簍、開一百五十件、價爲三十九元原盤、花生油無變化、交易祗有膠州油成交一百二十件、價亦開三十四元原盤、</p>

<p>蘭谿白蓮、因交通困難、來源至缺、價乃頻漲、邇來粵港帮均有銷胃、行盤再度上升、昨已售至一百二十元現鈔、前後須漲十餘元云、</p>

<p>廠粉　日昨現粉廠盤、已吿鬆疲、查南北客銷、連日尙稱不惡、惟吃盤頗爲重視、蓋最近市上大批洋粉運到後、北洋帮已運去不少、廠粉已受影響、故昨日起廠方爲競爭起見、已將廠盤降低二分半至五分、南北兩帮均有新交易、惟本街批價、尙未變動、仍守四元四角原盤、統市成交的計四萬餘包、市面環境、大致平疲、</p>
<p>洋粉　昨市况尙穩、近以國外電訊報漲、遠期定粉已鮮成交、市上現洋粉經連日本客之垂靑、浮存已見减少、故售方殊不變遷、惟廠粉廉價聲中、市面亦鮮特殊開展、聞蝙蝠雙鷹燈範等牌、仍售四元三角滙劃、惟帆船牌須加五分、又老牌紅日當天則須四元三角之現鈔、成交亦有二萬餘包云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易復趨沉靜、査前兩日新到之南就江北等麥、已被華北方面悉數搜辦、致市存又感缺乏、目下各粉廠原料、除洋麥定貨逐到外、本麥亦自向產地辦到、故對於市貨均鮮注意、而客帮亦以無貨可辦、相繼觀望、即有少數零星到貨、更爲日商之粉廠暗吸、故市塲交易、無形中又吿停頓云、</p>

<p>昨日各帮來源河下共祇到三叫號、車輪包子及蘇同崑山等帮共二千餘包、到貨見稀、售方心思遂堅、但銷塲方面、本街既淡、囤戶亦懈、故市面定局、然貨主亦有願脫者是以厚薄粳價悉已帶軟身段發、杜洋尖埠尖及變元仍以供求相仿、堅守原盤、</p>

<p>國外絲市、昨大致仍堅穩、雖若干遠期貨略見報跌、仍不足爲病、昨日紐約五月期跌二分、遠期開原盤、日絲八三分七五分現貨、則各報漲五分至七分、橫濱絲價晨市現貨小五元、遠期小十一元、里昂華絲開原盤、日絲則漲二法郞、觀夫海外絲價消長、現貨仍在優越環境中、允以日本在美法兩埠獨見俏利、絲價前途、似有所醞釀、且邇來週餘各地絲市、均呈堅定穩健、此後絲價、或將再度上升、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、由於國內外絲價同趨穩定、數月來苦於投機者之操縱、在此絲市平靜堅穩中、外銷絲乃大見活絡、昨日絲交續呈活躍、法莊高級白廠細條份及美莊七八分二○—三四月期交易、信孚達昌等行共進百數十担、行盤記錄除法莊絲細條紋如崇裕等售價至稱堅俏外、美莊均度絲竟較前日微漲十元、但絲市人心已顯然由堅平熊度而看高漲、輯里經絲交仍呆滯、國內外絲價相距尙達三〇元、印非絲市、久吿寂寥、邇日來自英法絲銷活躍後、亦似靜極思動、但亦因內外絲價距離尙遠、故一時未能成交、</p>

<p>加强防務頒佈綱要</p>
<p>浙江省政府頒佈戰時水陸交通工具管制辦法綱要、旨在加强沿海防務、强化交通效能、以謀內地物產暢銷、促進新經濟發展、指定交通處主持之省境內水陸交通工具、不分官有·民有·機力·人力·均依照該綱要規定辦理、同時對於重要軍事區域、巳築有工程、駐紮重兵、嚴密戒備、</p>
<p>通航口岸溫州一處</p>
<p>浙東沿海各口岸、除寗波·海門·溫州·三處外、均已先後禁止通航、龍山等碼頭、亦已拆毀、今海門之椒江、業已完全封鎖、寗波之鎭海、已嚴禁船隻出入、所以目前浙東唯一暫准通航口岸爲溫州、査溫州之甌江、在磬石已築有封鎖綫、惟封鎖綫上留有缺口、准船隻出入、對船隻之出入、必須先泊江心檢查、然後准許停靠碼頭、</p>
<p>日機飛浙偵察投彈</p>
<p>樂淸晨日機一架竄抵市空、散發荒謬傳單、同時瑞安發現日機一架、散發傳單、八日江山衢縣日機數架轟炸、察其目的、在飛機塲及浙贛車站、但所投之彈、均落荒地、地方無損失、聞江西之玉山、亦遭轟炸、彈入市區、毀屋甚多、並傷市民、</p>
<p>浙東洋面日艦巡弋</p>
<p>杭州灣日艦多艘停泊、對浙東似有所企圖、七日樂淸洋面發現單烟囱日艦一艘、經山大門而由西往柬、惟溫州之甌江口外、及海門之椒江口外、寗波之鎭海口外、業已無日艦踪跡、但浙洋面、時有發現日艦巡弋、</p>

<p>老弱婦孺長期救濟</p>
<p>市民組勸募委員會、以本市目前收容所難民、老弱婦孺居多、在戰事未結束前、勢須長期給養、故均盼各界繼續贊助認養運動、叉據該會發表、各界認養難民、現已達一萬名、</p>

<p>日艦在浙東洋面扣留葡商輪船、迫駛回上海後、各輪旅客、雖已完全釋放、惟貨物不准卸下、泰昌祥代理之葡輪大德號、前日又被扣、葡總領昨正式提書面抗議、並呈報公使、準備電駐日公使、向日政府交涉茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>監視各輪不准卸貨</p>
<p>被扣之棠貝·棠喬·棠魯·美達·海龍·利寳·魯德·寳德·等八艘、經日艦允許先後駛入吳淞口後、現泊楊樹浦第十六·十七·十八號浮筒、旅客雖已完全釋放　惟各輸仍由日艦監視行動、每艘船上派有日軍駐守、禁止各輪無綫電台發電報吿、以致各輪電台與谷公司無法通報、至於各輪船員自船主以下至水手爲止、均仍留居在船上、所裝貨物　亦未准卸下、</p>
<p>葡大德輪又被扣留</p>
<p>泰昌祥代理之葡輪大德號（Data）、係行駛滬溫綫、以裝貨爲主（俗稱夾板船）、此决由溫裝貨駛抵滬後、停靠浦東隆茂碼頭卸貨、於前日貨物卸竣、擬開往楊樹浦三十一號浮筒停泊、致爲日艦扣留、現亦泊十七號浮筒、由日艦派兵駐守監視、惟係空船、故無貨物、船員均留在船上、但據泰昌祥謂該輪係葡商遠東公司所有、惟遠東公司則吾認之、</p>
<p>葡領昨提書面抗議</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向葡萄牙駐滬總領事館探悉、駐滬葡總領愛爾夫斯、對葡商綸被扣事件、會往訪日本駐滬三浦總領事、及日本海軍當局詢問、業已將經過事實査明、根據各該國航商之報吿、於昨晨十時、正式向日本駐滬三浦總領、提出書面抗議聞抗議書內容、甚爲强硬、要求立即釋放各商輪、保障以後不得有同樣事件</p>
<p>呈報公使電日交涉</p>
<p>又據航業方面消息、各被扣之葡輪、自被迫懸日旗後、今各輪之葡旗、尸爲取下、當時曾經各葡籍船主交涉無效、各葡商因取下國旗、有關政府主權、於是甚爲憤慨、已報吿葡總領事、向日抗議、並聞葡總領已呈報葡駐華公使、準備電葡駐日公使、向日政府提出交涉、同時葡商各輪船公司所有各輪、經會商決定、暫緩開航、</p>
<p>葡商各輪暫停航行</p>
<p>葡商各輪、决定暫停航行後、（一）停泊在上海之葡輪、爲美利公司之美發輪·正德公司之山泰輪·華美公司之棠賽輪·萬國公司之新德輪·遠東公司之發德輪、（二）停泊在溫州之葡輪、爲萬國公司之民和輪·遠東公司之大茂輪、在被扣葡輪事件未解決以前、一律暫綏開航、所以目前沿海、並無葡輪行駛、</p>
<p>意德商輪獨航溫州</p>
<p>自葡商輪船停航後、滬溫航綫由德意輪船獨航、（一）意商義華洋行實利輪及德商魯麟洋行飛康輪、均於昨日結關、今日由滬駛溫州、（二）意商中意公司德平輪及德商禮和洋行海福輪、均定明日結關、後日由滬駛溫州、（三）英商太古·怡和·兩公司輪船、雖有核准行駛滬溫錢者、但日前並無船雙行駛、</p>
<p>交涉發還各輪郵件</p>
<p>爲扣留之葡輪、如美和公司之美達輪·及大西洋公司海龍輪、裝有由滬寄溫或巾溫寄滬之郵袋、是頂郵袋、同在被日艦所帶扣、聞上海郵政管理局已向日方交涉發還、日方已允所請、准予發還、至目前之滬溫聞郵件及句裹、則裝寳利德平等輪承運、</p>

<p>（五）精神總動員應照國防最高會所頒佈的實施辦法推行、本市各團體機關各學校各工廠和各商店中國民精神總動員工作之推行和月會的舉行、應由各該團體·機關·學校·工廠·商店·的負責人和本市精神總動員協會領導、但同時各下級機關及全體羣衆、應以自動自覺的精神馬上就在下層發動起來、而不能有所等待、一定要上級來領導後才去進行、因為精神動員的主要目的、是在動員更廣泛的人民大衆、自動地來參加抗戰工作、所以在動員的實踐過程中、——也就是組織過程中——應儘量來執行初步的民權、如選舉彈劾·複決·等權、都可一一予以實施、因為祇有這樣、才能提高羣衆在這運動中的自動的積極的精神、才能使這一運動成爲眞正的羣衆性的運動、而使國民月會成為眞正的民主的羣衆組織、</p>
<p>（六）國民月會的舉行、應竭力避免爲開會宜誓的空洞儀式、而應使消極的條文變爲積極的羣衆行動、但也不應該破壞所規定之儀式、領導者和羣衆、校長和學生、廠長和工人、經理和店員、凡參與精神穩動員運動並舉行宣誓之後、應即嚴厲遵守國民公的所規定之十二條，互相監督鼓勵、則所謂「不賣日貨」等等的消極條文、也就變為「抵制日貨」等等的積極行動了</p>
<p>（七）應在國民精神總動員中建立新的廣大的統一的羣衆組織、並藉此而擴大羣衆組織、但決不是各民衆團體因此而放棄它本位工作、如文化界學生界職業界婦女界工界、必須廣泛的以精神總動員這一綱領、號召並組織未被組織的落後羣衆到各界裏來、但文化界決不因此而放棄對於各種學術的精深的研究、學生界決不因此而放棄學生本身福利的追求、婦女界決不因此放棄婦女解放任務、職工界亦決不因此放棄職工本身生活的相當改善、所以國民精神總動員、可說是一種適應抗戰建國這一大目標的綜合的全民組織、而各界的本位組織和工作、也正是推動這全民組織的唯一某礎、</p>
<p>（八）各界各團體內、應迅速成立動員委員會和國民月會、推行動員工作、但因鑒於上海之特殊環境、各團體·機關·學校工廠·商店、如不能舉行全體共同之月會、應分成小組·部門·年級·車間·等分頭舉行月會、並由各小組·部門·年級·車間等推選代表、組織代表制的共同月會、使上下層不致有隔膜之處、</p>
<p>（九）各界、各團體、各機關、各學校、各工廠、各商店之間、以及各小組、各年級、各部門、各車間之間、應訂定互相競賽和互相檢査之具體辦法、以求國民精神總動員運動的切實展開</p>
<p>（十）各界各團體各機關各學校各工廠各商店、應擇精神總動員綱領中最與本位工作有適切關係者、作為精神動員中之中心工作、如文化界應以校正錯誤言論、反對漢奸妥協思想、發揚忠恕民族道德等為其中心任務、其他各界均可類推、</p>
<p>（十一）各界各學校各機關各工精神推行總動員、一方面應由黨政人員及七層分子負責領導、但另一方面、必須由各團體作為推動及監督的核心、如學校工廠商店、應由校長廠長經理領導宣言、但爲整個工作的推動起見、必須由敎育協會學生會工會各職業界各種體團負切實推進之責、俾收黨政、各界、各階習成打一片之效、</p>
<p>（十二）由於上海環境特殊、各界儘可能應依照國民精神總動員綱領所指示配合自己工作的環境、發起種種新的組織、但此項組織、必須與各界有隸屬關係、再通過各界、受黨政機關的領導與指示、上海各民衆團體、</p>

<p>別爲兩派遂成對立狀態、旋以爭執監護權乃由胡蔚雲向第一特區地方法院對任鎰安·那長生·常孝松等提起控訴、而邱氏子女長生·長蔭·淑英·及親屬賈耀臣·周樹卿·奚邱聯珠·方朱鶴貞·朱鶴年等、均被該兩派競相羅致爲重要證人、日前該案曾經一度開審、到庭者宛如召開邱氏親屬會議、昨日午後則經承審該案之桂裕推事、單傳邱之</p>
<p>幼子長蔭女淑英、到庭審究、屆時祇邱長蔭一人投案、聲明彼今十八歲、淑英係彼之姊、今十九歲、因臥病放未能同來、僅彼偕家中司賬一名投案候示、庭上首詢以目前之生活狀况、家產情形、及以後願受何人監護、長蔭即遂一詳答、謂家中生活、向歸保管委員會負責、彼現在家內讀書、彼之生母賈氏、逝世已八九年、</p>
<p>彼之行動除兄長生外、無人過問、賈耀臣並非母舅、因其與母同姓、故時迭來糾纒、始每月給其四十元、故賈所出收條、寫有邱府慨助字句、此足可以證明其非母舅、况母生前亦從未嘗言賈係母舅、至於胡蔚雲更不相識、對於若輩當然不能信任、願聽兄長生監護、而嫂氏</p>
<p>相遇亦厚並稱彼將於三月廿九日娶婦、未婚妻乃彼自己選擇等語、庭上繼復將其知識測騐一過、隨問其居家言動、是吾有人包圍、今之所供、有無他人預先授意、苟或有之、則既至法庭、不須顧慮、儘可據實陳述、長蔭答稱、所言均出己意、並將賈耀臣收款之收條呈案、桂推事决更</p>
<p>加以勗勉之詞、謂靑年人應自立志、歷練技能、允貴乎精明强幹、倘學問知識不足、無論家財如何豐富、皆不難蕩盡也、爾應識之、長蔭受訓之下、唯唯退去、至於胡蔚雲與任鎰安等所爭監護邱家財產之訟、聞尙將繼續調査審究云、</p>

<h3 id="c123">閒話睡衣 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 余振雄</p>
<p>在我國一般的家庭中，是絕少有睡衣的，正因爲它的少，所以竟可說沒有。當你的一個女朋友，在誇耀她有着多少衣服時，如果你去問伊有幾件睡衣的話，那一定使伊非常掃興而認爲你在有意的打趣伊呢！有的更不知睡衣爲何物。這是把女子作一個例吧！男子中有多少知道陲衣而有着睡衣的？但事實上一班出洋留學過的，崇尙歐化的，在大學或有錢人家的男女，大都有着一件浴衣，而也就當它作睡衣了！但如果嚴格的說，浴衣是浴衣，睡衣是睡衣，雖然有浴衣，是等於沒有睡衣一樣的！</p>
<p>那麽睡衣是怎樣的呢？簡言之，一件短掛，一條褲子罷了！但它的效用，是不可算小的，普通我們上床睡的時候、男子大半是一件背心和一條短褲，小孩和中年以上的人自例外，而女子則恕我不知道了，在寒天那麼加上件短掛和長褲。可是這加上去的一身，却從沒有另拿一身的，而就把當天穿的一身短衫褲套上身。這就有妨害了；一則衣服容易汚穢，容易團皺，二則衣領袖口上的油垢汚點，往往要帶沾到潔白的褥子被單上去，是多麼的厭惡啊！所以如果你穿了睡衣，那這一切弊害，是全都沒有了！而且睡衣的格式，總較寬大而不用紐扣，可以不阻礙睡後呼吸或皮肉的壓痛，並且因爲早晚更衣的緣故，使你養成了愛乾凈和勤更衣的習慣！對於晚上有打被的人，也不致會受到風寒了！</p>
<p>上面幾點，我不過想得着的來一說吧了！其他還有特點，那要穿着後自會體騐到的。現在再附帶一說睡衣的質料和式樣；質料是用毛巾布做最好，决則軟熟的布綢都相宜，講究的用白緞子做，那未免太奢侈和過分了！終之要柔軟及保持體溫爲上。式樣和平常衣褲相彷彿，差別的是寬大和不用紐扣，而用帶子打結來代替，這樣可以任你寬鬆緊收了！允其對肚子有莫大好處，因爲睡時不宜束之過緊的！筆者試附草圖二張，一男式一女式，供讀者們作參考。女的袖子腰身較細，和腰間多一根帶子，袖口是翻領，男的則無領最舒適。褲子粗看男女無別，其實女的要比男的脚管收縮多多，則非常合宜和有樣！</p>

<p>上星期木菜單中，曾介紹了兩樣春季的時鮮葷菜，本星期再來介紹一二時鮮素菜，不但是適口充腸，並且也不違反經濟原則的。其一是枸杞竹筍絲，枸杞性質淸凉，與竹筍絲同炒，風味隽永，實在豆苗之上，不過糖與油必須多一些，要是放得太少，那就不入味了，其二是萵苣拌竹筍，也是佐飯佐粥的妙品，須竹筍先蒸熟，爲苣須把鹽搦過，然後用醬麻油同拌，做法極其簡單。萵苣葉切勿丢掉，把它和竹荀丁同炒，固然可口；允其妙的，是用來嫺飯吃，再加些肉丁，筍丁，醬油，猪油在內，又香又腴，比了市上的菜飯，好吃十倍哩。</p>
<p>星期一</p>
<p>韮茅炒肉絲　紅燒小鱖魚　枸杞竹笱絲　雪菜菉豆芽</p>
<p>星期二</p>
<p>醃魚燒肉　淸燉刀魚　蝦子麵筋　炒蓬蒿菜</p>

<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>時問雖然是由淸晨而到黃昏，又由黃昏而輪轉到淸晨，週而復始的過着；人們的吃雖然也是由晨餐而晚餐，又由晚餐而再吃晨餐，循環不息的吃着；但是，淸晨總被認爲是一日生活的開始，晨餐也是第一餐，——一日工作開始前必須進服的養料，像機器開始轉動以前必須加油的原理是一樣的，所以，在淸晨各階層的人們都得首先裝飽了肚子，再去工作。</p>
<p>在上海，吃雖然多，川，廣，蘇，間，……以及歐美等，各種口味都有，但却因錢劃分出了等級，從西菜社的晨餐起到弄堂口的粢飯攤止，這其問，眞不知道有多少階層？而人們吃的方式也不知道有多少種？在淸晨，走進南京路幾家大餐館，大茶室中一望，那裏面盡是胃口細嫩的紳士淑女，把一杯牛奶，兩塊白塔士司，或者幾隻雞包鴨餃，當作晨餐。在西菜社裹自然就是吃西式晨餐；不過，那些吃外國晨餐的中國人，明知那種味道不及在家裏吃碗隔夜剩菜佐的粥來得實惠，但爲了要撑塲面，擺闊，却不得不進出西菜社，儼然西僑風度。</p>
<p>次一級的人們就羣趨於麵館或菜館附設的小吃部，一角錢一碗麵或一客湯包，也可當作晨餐；這種介乎高貴與低賤之間的晨餐，化錢既不多，而外觀又很大方，比上雖不足，比下却有餘，所以，一般講經濟而又要面子的薪給階級，最爲歡迎，那些地方，每天淸晨總是擁塞得極度的飽滿，坐無隙地。</p>
<p>比較再次一級的晨餐呢？似乎要算攤頭上出賣的粥與麵了，這種難頭在市街的邊沿或者小菜塲附近，擺設着一塊板，進餐的主顧大多是店員，工人，小販，坐下來就伏板大嚼，猪頭肉炒麵，羊肉煮粥，牛肉，油豆腐，綫粉湯，也可隨胃口所喜而作適當的配置。以這種食品當作晨餐，在一般比較高貴的人看來，會覺得太淸苦了吧？其實呢，還可說一句：「比上不足，比下有餘。」那些在各弄堂口擺設的粢飯桶，大餅攤，豆腐漿攤，火烘山薯，糯米圓子，……這些食品，還有更多的人把它當作晨餐；一般販夫走卒，用氣力換取生活的人羣，以及失了業的流浪者，吃起來也津津有味，和高貴的人們吃西菜，雞鴨肉麵，蝦仁水餃是一樣的能够果腹，一樣的可當晨餐，——雖然代價低，品質劣。</p>
<p>上海人的晨餐，就是這樣的被錢劃分出了質量上不與的等級！</p>

<h3 id="c127">參加團體生活 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>國民精神總動員的綱領裏面，有許多事項，要我們一一實行，我相信凡是中華民國的百姓，在抗戰建國的同一信念下，是一定樂於接受的。不過事項雖有許多，而我認爲最基本的第一著，却就是各人分別加入各個團體。</p>
<p>當然，每一個人，不加入什麼團體，只盡其在我的行動，一樣也可以使自己的精神動員起來，而有助於國家民族。然而這樣一來，却就有流弊發生了：第一，各個力量不能集中，力量的能率就必减少；第二，沒有互相督促和監視，易生懈怠之心；第三，精神始終不知振作者，或有意規避者，無法使他一致動員起來。因此，我們不欲精神總動員則己，要實行精神總動員，就必須每一個人，分別加人各個團體，例如農界的國民，參加國民精神總動員協會的農界支部，工界的參加工界的支部，其他商界，敎育界，任何一界，無不如此。至於服務在某一個機關，會社，公司，或仟何已成的團體裏面的，如果該團體有支部的組織，常然也就應該加人，共同努力。</p>
<p>歷來外國人嘲笑我們，說我們沒有團結力：就是孫中山先生也說過，我們以前曾像一盤散沙。自從民國肇造以來，雖然團結方面已經有許多表現，而抗戰以來，雖然散沙已成爲一塊鎔合的堅鐵，但我們假使不時加奮發，鍛鍊，我們的團結力，仍隨時有渙散的可能，而堅鐵也有腐蝕的趨勢，所以精神總動員是必要的，而第一步就是各人入各個團體，加入了各個團體，才可以集中力量。加人個團體，就是實行精神總動員！</p>
<p>人類本來是有羣性的動物；喜歡離羣索居的，或者特立獨行的，雖然自鳴淸高，而得到一部份人的讚美，按之實際，是違反自然的，阻遏文明進化的，到底不足爲訓。所以，即使在平時，每一個人也當有團體的生活，在現在，抗戰建國，是何等大事業，就更非羣策羣力不可，而我們就當以積極參加團體生活爲始點！</p>
<p>我希望：每一個已經參加團體的始終努力下去，而還沒有參加的，就在這時去參加各人自認爲適於自己的團體</p>
<h3 id="c128">初到火綫的一晚 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>拖着被飢餓和疲乏征服得軟綿綿的身體，從師部　指揮所裏跨了出來，憑着來時的一點淡薄的經騐，我們都以爲可以摸索回去的。不想，才走出門來不遠，我們都迷失在被黑暗籠罩着的遼闊無邊的原野裏了。</p>
<p>我們的右前方照耀着一片怕人的通紅的火光，那點級着無數亮晶晶的小星的深湛的碧空，也被那猛烈的火光烘紅了。槍砲擊不停的密密麻麻的攪做一團，就像耍把被黑暗籠罩着的這世界撕毀了去似的。在這震耳的混亂的槍聲裏，那像橢砧板似的機關搶聲顯得非常之淸脆：噠噠噠噠噠……</p>
<p>「怎麽走呢？」</p>
<p>「我記得：來時我們經過一條埂子，怎麼現在會走到這些麥田裹來？連路也沒有，你看，怎麽走？」</p>
<p>「當心！不要走到敵人的防綫裹去，要曉得這裹已是前綫上了！」</p>
<p>經過一度小小的商議，大家決定仍回到師部的指揮所裏去。在黑暗中摸索着走了不遠，忽然，一個傳令兵從指揮所裏走了出來，便領着我們回到石拉去。</p>
<p>路上什麽也看不淸，我們聚緊的一個跟一個的摸索着前進。但兩脚常給什麽東西阻住，幾乎跌到地上去。有時，兩脚又陷到一些泥塘裏去，使你拔也拔不起米！</p>
<p>晚風帶着幾分寒冷，一陣陣的吹着，田裏的那些麥苗篏簌的在搖動着，就像有敵人從田裏走過來了似的。默默的走着，但一而睜大眼睛舉行着警戒。槍砲聲仍熱閙的在響着，那通紅的火光仍那末燦爛，那末炫耀，就像太陽初出來的那頃刻。</p>
<p>通過了警戒綫，好容易回到我們住的那間小小的房內來了。推開門進去一看，房內滿給十多個同志東一僩西一個的睡滿了。</p>
<p>「嘿，你們的飯還沒有吃？」」還沒有睡着的那唯一的女同志，穿着她那件花呢大衣，從一細高粱桿上爬了起來迎着我們問。</p>
<p>「沒有吃，你們的吃過了？」</p>
<p>「吃了！」她簡單的回答了一句，便從棹子上托起一籮乾冷飯來遞給我們：「趕緊吃！趕緊吃！」</p>
<p>我們嚼了一口乾冷飯，再也嚥不下去了。食饞的望着她：「有沒有菜？」</p>
<p>「沒有。」</p>
<p>「有沒有鹽？」</p>
<p>「也沒有！」</p>
<p>「呵……」大家不由得笑起來了。</p>
<p>狼呑虎嚼的嚥了兩口飯，算是吃過飯了。但怎麼睡呢？這末多的人在一處，而且還夾雜着一個女同志……</p>
<p>這女同志姓湯，據說，當我們的隊伍駐紮在江西德安時，她便毅然丢棄了家庭，學校，投到我們的部隊裹來，這難得的事情，那時，還在江西報紙上大登而特登過。對於這一個年靑的女同志，雖然別的人因爲她工作能力而對她懐着一種漢視的熊度，但我對她是非常敬佩的，自從抗戰發生到現在，佔着全人口二萬二千五百萬的女同胞，像她這樣犧牲一切到前綫來的，試問有幾個？單就這一點，我就覺得她是値得敬佩的。</p>
<p>「起來，重新鋪鋪才好睡。不然，這麼多的人怎麼睡？」</p>
<p>「起來，不願做奴隸的人們！……」湯同志滑稽的唱起義勇軍進行曲來，這使被睡眠襲擊着的人們不由得笑起來了。</p>
<p>東一個，西一個，正好睡着的人們，不願意的爬起來了，大家才把棹子及那堆家具什物搬開，各人便忙把預備好的灰毡鋪在地上，湯同志也在道熱閙的競爭下，在靠近大門的一邊，把灰毡在地上鋪了起來。什麼地方都給灰毡鋪滿了，但我的灰毡還拿在手裏沒有地方放下。</p>
<p>「我睡的地方呢？」</p>
<p>「湯同志旁邊不是還可以睡嗎？」大家像做了一件甚麽得意的事情似的，望着我吃吃的只是傻笑着。</p>
<p>「那裏……」我被笑得難爲情起來了，不由得也跟着他們傻笑着，房裹充滿了年靑人的元氣旺盛的笑聲。</p>
<p>看着湯同志的那種無拘東的坦然睡在那裏的樣子，我靦覜的也把灰毡鋪下去了。出乎我的意料之外，笑聲也便隨着消滅下去了。房裏就只聽得門外的那槍砲聲猛烈的在響着……</p>

<p>啄木鳥專門在樹木裏找尋它的食糧，而寄居在樹木中的害蟲永遠在避免它的目標。</p>
<p>社會裏也永遠對立着兩種不同的人，決不能用情感來解決，就是勇敢者和末等人。</p>
<p>深夜，想起這細小的問題，希望能給我一個異常準確的答案，把我思慮澄淸一下。</p>
<p>今天我找到了一個圓滿的解答，見到了象形的啄木鳥和腐蝕蟲，乾脆說。勇敢者和末等人在敵對地串演很生動的壯烈的事跡。</p>
<p>穿入利的誘惑中，　在祿的深淵裹，這樣一個人，末等的傢伙，給勇敢者按正義打死了，有人驚奇，這是「暗殺」。我說：平淡無奇。許多人願意做爲「淘金而死」的事情，何况，這死的爽快與它的只求名利的「下海」迅速，成了個正比。你說奇，大的是驚奇他死的方法平淡，沒稱大家心，在司法下把它處死吧。</p>
<p>寫蝕蟲絕對逃不出啄木鳥的尖嘴，你應知道；當它矢銳的嘴和舌捲上了蟲之後，便是吿訴你答案的機會。</p>

<h3 id="c134">「吃砒霜藥老虎」 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 華父</p>
<p>天下的聰明人是死不絕的。他們說：第一要損人利己：第二要利己利人：第三要－不，第三耍不得了—！第三不要損己損人：至於第四，損己利人，只有天下的大傻子才肯如此，更其要不得！總之，聰明人是有他的獨特精神的：自己要生不要死，甚至不得已而求其决，不能好好地生，也當惡惡地生，總不願好好地死。他們說，好死不如惡活，於是乎，吃砒霜藥老虎，乃成爲他們所嘲笑的對象。</p>
<p>他們遇見老虎，一定供以豬羊，滿足老虎的食慾。豬羊沒有了，老虎對他們熟視着，似乎欲得而甘心，他們至多躱避，決不敢抵抗。他們說，老虎是何等巨物，豈敢去動一動牠的毫毛，自討苦吃。假使看看逃小開呢，他們就只有跪在地上，哀哀求吿，即使到老虎張口要呑他們時，他們雖然手裏有砒霜，還不肯望自已嘴裹塞進去，而希望自己終究能够做一個「虎口餘生」。可是這種人的結果，我們是可想而知的，不過給老虎當一頓並不見情的點心罷了。</p>
<p>天下任何聰明人，也許不會看見老虎要吃他，果然就笨到如此地步。然而天下正有這樣的聰明人，看見和老虎一般要制其死命的危機，要逃逃不了，要打打不過，終不敢慷慨赴義，以一死指拚。他們只想哀求，確實在做着「與虎謀皮」的勾當。他們說，生存爲第一要件；兩敗俱傷是不値得的。</p>
<p>他們夢想與老虎「共存共榮」；他們以爲老虎也有人性，可以和牠講情理：他們更以爲即使被老虎吃了，自己還可以作另一方式的生存！作倀鬼，得到老虎主子的任用。因此，他們自以爲理論圓滿，事實週到，自己早就立於不敗之地，只要向老虎求和，這樣也可以生，那樣也可以生，惟有抵抗老虎，在他們看來，却是末路。</p>
<p>其實老虎也者，往往是「紙老虎」，一加戮穿，醜熊畢現。即使不是紙老虎，也不過是「狗頭老虎」，憑牠的本能，也只會偷偷豬羊，到底沒有吃人的膽量和力量，只要人看見了就與以迎頭痛擊－任何武器都行，不一定要快槍。假使牠眞是一頭金睛白額的大蟲，的確會吃人，那我們就該拚命的打，打不過就實行吃了砒霜去藥牠！反正是個死，爲什麽不和牠同歸於盡呢！</p>
<p>我讃芙吃砒霜藥老虎的精神。有了這種精神，我想假使虎而有知，也當退避三舍。聰明人的嘲笑是預備作偎鬼的。我們既不預備作倀鬼，管什麽嘲笑！我們木此精神，根絕了虎息，就可以看見聰明人的嘲笑落到他們自己的頭上了。</p>

<h3 id="c135">東北片商血淚語 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>鐵蹄下之偽「滿」影業近狀</p>
<p>東北四省淪陷，傀儡登塲，變爲僞「滿洲國」以來，民衆們在被壓迫下，度着很慘苦的非人生活，所有一切事業，都被統制。允其是屬於文化部門的電影事業，加緊壓迫，剝奪利益，不遺餘力，直把他們當作牛馬看待。最近，有位旅滬片商，談起那裏一番慘情，眞是血淚俱下！這裏，謹作一簡略記述，以見暗無天日的東北電影業的眞實情形。</p>
<p>電影檢查</p>
<p>僞「滿」電影檢查在日籍顧問統率之下，起先是很凌亂的概由各省區隨地檢查，各自爲政。因此好惡從心，漫無標的。有時甲地映過的片子，常在乙地遭禁。丙地被剪得體無完膚的，在丁地却又原封不動地映出。這樣莫明其妙的檢査事件，電影商常被弄得走投無路，痛苦難言。一九三四年七月間，頒布了所謂「東方電影檢査統一方針」，改歸僞「民政部警務司」置施辦理，從那時起始，電影檢査，才算歸於「統一」。</p>
<p>奴化影片</p>
<p>日本影片在僞「滿」開映，也須經過審查。不過這僅是形式上的手續而已。實際上日本可以公映的影片在僞滿是決不會受到仟何留難的。而它們有一部份戴着「東亞和平」面具的奴化影片，且常獲得僞「民政部」的褒獎。但有些日本影片，無非映給他們自己欣賞而已。</p>
<p>剝削慘况</p>
<p>不久以前，又成立一個所謂「電影管理局」，管理偽「滿」境內一切電影行政，和其他機關一樣，表面上由僞「官」主持，實際大權則操於日籍顧問的掌握。「管理局」對於電影實施嚴格統制，輸入各片概須交與掌管，營業也須由它們去支配。所有全部營業收人，「管理局」概與片主四六分拆——「管理局」取四成，片主得六成，這樣剝削手段，更是橫暴得無可理喻。國產影片東北映權售價，連得一切費用在內，每片的須四千元左右。所以每片營業收入必須超過七千元才能歸本，片商的利益，都彼搶去，無異在給他們充當牛馬。</p>
<p>國片近狀</p>
<p>至於在僞「滿開映的國產片，大都是些幾年前的純娛樂性的舊片。凡是稍有一點民族意識與時代思想的國片，絕對不會在那裹出映。僞「滿」當局對於此類影片禁制固然嚴極，片商們也不敢輕於冒險，幹這種有殺身之禍的賣買。</p>
<p>最後，據他見告：對於這種牛馬生活，自己早就放棄不幹了；以前雖也是爲生活關係，迫於無奈；但在自己良心上總不免赧然，受着無形的譴責，覺得非常不安。總之，這種黑暗圈子裏的非人生活，非身歷其境的人們；是不知道那樣慘苦的。</p>

<p>— 劇史</p>
<p>南下動機純為傀儡所邀請</p>
<p>上海遊藝界聞之作何感想</p>
<p>趙嘯瀾爲尙小雲入室弟子，她非超等名角，但在北平坤角中，亦屬庸中之俊佼，雪艷琴章遏雲輩之下，趙亦可佔一席地；且趙曾兩决南下，第一次隨手盛藻搭黃金大戲院，第二决曾在更新卡爾登出演，俱載譽北歸。最近傳來消息，足使愛趙伶藝術之士，爲之倒吹一口冷氣，蓋趙日來方戰歌載舞於石頭城畔，以供傀儡之「欣賞」也。</p>
<p>筆者聞此消息後，曾叩詢滬上梨園界中人，則亦語　不詳，乃函詢寓居京華之友人，遂得趙伶南來之群情，記之以爲海上游藝界吿，更願梨園界進一步有所表示也。</p>
<p>南京之傀儡政府，舉行所謂「津涌綫首决通車」典禮，北平之大小傀儡，組南下「觀光團」到京，而隨此「觀光團」南下者，則有北平名伶若干，爲之領隊者，趙嘯　也。劇團除趙氏母女外，凡十四人，名單如：</p>
<p>領隊　趙嘯</p>
<p>劇員　李玉泰　于蓮仙</p>
<p>唐福順　孫來順</p>
<p>趙春錦　姚世茄</p>
<p>王田甫　趙榮亭</p>
<p>陳達忱　錢林</p>
<p>琴師　張連升　松文明</p>
<p>方玄善　董鳳年</p>
<p>趙嘯瀾一行抵京後，即膺「維新政府宣傳局」之「歡宴」，趙即在席間淸唱，以助「豪與」。當晚，應「大民會」之請，在「南京廣播」電台播昔，並定三日晚起，假座中央舞台演劇，事前，由「維新政府」請求日方軍報道部特准，專誠邀請中日兩方「要員」「欣賞」，第四五兩日，則爲「大民會」主辦，係免費招待各界市民，所定戲目，爲鴻鸞禧，百花亭，春秋配，女起解，玉堂春，虹霓關。</p>
<p>至於趙此次南下，其動機完全爲傀儡所邀請，決非爲營業性質，蓋並無所謂包銀，中間接洽者，爲北京「新民會指導部」張慶生奉其主子軍報道部之命而承辦，全團「酬報」，聞爲五千金，以此戔戔，竟使名坤伶利令智昏，亦今歲梨園界之一頁大事也！</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>李狀元殿試時有怪風相助</p>
<p>李蟠這時始終都是如同失了知覺的一樣，等到三唱的時候，連喊兩聲李蟠的名字，他都未曾答應，依舊是糊裏糊塗的跪在殿前；及至第三次又喚他時，忽然兩名太監架着他就走，自已彷彿同作夢似的，就把個頭名狀元弄到手了。但是很奇怪的，就是李蟠被圍幕遮掩之後，立即筆不停揮，一刹那就把卷子寫完，呈上去後，也是他的文字最優，這眞是一陣怪風帮了他的忙了。</p>
<p>李蟠當大主考時，在他手裏中的進士如年羹堯·阿爾泰這般人，都是官高爵顯，名震一時的。他晚年作壽時，別人賀他的詩中，曾有「門牆桃李半公卿」的諛詞，這也可見他當時的聲勢了。雍正時他的掌兄弟李衛，曾經作到宰相，所以淸初時李家的勢派是很驚人的。民國後會作過閩督的李厚基，亦即李衛的嫡系子孫，從李向陽先生起到現時爲止，李氏可算是明，淸，民國，三代的世家了。當日向陽先生是穩當的一個狀元却偏不去拿，然而到他三世子孫時，不但依舊出了一個狀元，而且還饒了一個宰相，李先生要不是名滿天下，人格·學識·在在都爲人所推崇，教想滿奴是決不會如此垂靑他的後人的。以前科舉時代，首須開呈考試人的三代，淸廷因震於向陽先生的大名，知道他是有人格，有家敎的，所以才委曲求全的硬把個狀元點了李蟠，不過李蟠這人，我很替他可惜可惜的緣因，就是因他沒有繼承他祖父的大志，不知利用他當時的地位和聲望，去號召恢復明室的志士，以完成向陽先生米竟之偉業，這未免坐失良機了。而况彼時滿奴的軍政大權，敢說是十之八九，都操在他的掌握之中，日前我曾說過：「年羹堯的尊師，」那是古今極罕見的。李蟠倘能曉以大義，說以排滿復明的志趣，我想生在富有革命性的廣東廣寗縣人如年大將軍者，亦必爲之心動也。那時他手握數十萬大兵，同時政權又操於李蟠的堂弟李衛之手，一個宰相同一個兵馬大元帥俱已同意之後，李蟠再把他祖父向陽先生的旗號打出，恐怕一舉手之問，就可將滿奴逐出國境了。可惜李狀元計不出此，祗和一般抱有個人主義者的官僚們是一樣的沒有民族思想，自個享樂一生，也就算完了。這樣他雖是作了狀元，我想向陽先生也一定耍含恨於　原的。</p>

Also, at about 4 PM on the 10th, a small number of Japanese soldiers attempted to forcibly cross the river at Jinjiadu, but were discovered by the Chinese army and immediately subjected to a fierce attack. The Japanese soldiers immediately fled in disarray. (12th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: The Chinese army that crossed the Fu River to launch an offensive, in addition to encircling the Japanese army on the west bank of Liangjiadu, also advanced towards Nanchang in separate directions. (11th dispatch)</p>

The Chinese army once broke through the Japanese defense line near Fengxin the day before yesterday (10th). The area is 40 kilometers west of Nanchang. The Japanese army immediately dispatched more than 2,000 reinforcements and launched a vigorous counter-attack. According to observations from the Chinese army side, 10 kilometers east of Gao'an, the reason why the Japanese army is fiercely attacking the Chinese army's positions between Gao'an and Nanchang is to concentrate the Chinese army's forces here, so that the Japanese army can take advantage of the situation and enter the area around Ruishui. It is reported that the Chinese army in the Wuling area has moved its positions under the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. As for the fighting in the Hanshui area, it is still ongoing, and the outcome is uncertain. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

Only south of Yonglong River has the Chinese army made some northward progress. Some of the Japanese troops who had gathered at Ershan were sent north to reinforce, and some were sent to reinforce the Hanyi Road. The main force is on the left flank of the Chinese army. Currently, the Japanese rear is empty, and reinforcements have been cut off. The Japanese army is very panicked. (12th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yichang) The Chinese armies in central Hubei are conducting flanking maneuvers towards the rear of the Japanese forces. The Japanese troop movements are severely constrained. More than 200 Japanese soldiers who were reinforced from Zaodaokou Tianmen were detected by a certain unit, which ambushed them near Wenjiadun, between Tianmen and Zao, and launched a head-on assault when the Japanese soldiers approached, killing more than 80 Japanese soldiers and dozens of mules and horses, and capturing four warhorses and some firearms.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Issue of Japan's Sabotage of China's Coastal Shipping Industry <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Excluding the power of European and American countries in China is one of the important tasks for Japan to establish the so-called "New Order in East Asia." Taking the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China as an example, the issue of navigation on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, which European and American countries have been negotiating for a long time, has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. Recently, Japan has intensified its use of force to interfere with the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China. In the past few days, nine Portuguese merchant ships in the Zhejiang sea area have been detained by Japanese warships and forced to Shanghai. The British ship "Siggs" was also detained by a Japanese warship on its way from Xiamen to Fuzhou and forced to Taiwan. Japan's interference with the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China did not start recently. However, Japan's recent large-scale detention of British and Portuguese merchant ships clearly indicates that it has even more aggressive intentions for the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China than mere interference.</p>
<p>Since launching its war of aggression against China, Japan has implemented a maritime blockade of China, but it has not cut off transportation between various ports along the Chinese coast. Japan's incomplete blockade is partly due to its fear of provoking interference from third parties. At the same time, it also has economic intentions, namely, to use the shipping between various ports to allow large quantities of Japanese goods to be transshipped to the interior, and many raw materials needed by Japan during the war can also be obtained from the Chinese interior in the same way, so that trade between China and Japan after the war is even more prosperous than before the war. But now things have changed, and interference from third parties is no longer an issue in fact. Japan's blockade of traffic on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers only elicited ineffective protests from European and American countries. Last month, Japan banned European and American merchant ships from sailing between ports north of the Yangtze River in the lower reaches, and European and American countries did not make any practical gestures. Japan anticipates that in order to control China's shipping industry, destroying the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China will not provoke interference from European and American countries. As for the indirect trade that Japan engages in using China's coastal shipping industry, because the Chinese government's control over foreign trade is becoming increasingly strict, it is no longer as easy as it used to be. After Japan's failure in its economic conspiracy, destroying the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China in order to completely blockade China's maritime traffic has become an inevitable act of aggression by Japan.</p>
<p>The reasons Japan recently gave for detaining merchant ships from European and American countries, according to the navy, are: (1) the ships are carrying Chinese guerrillas; (2) they are carrying armaments for the Chinese side; (3) the ships' nationalities are unclear. These three reasons are actually just excuses for deliberately destroying the coastal shipping industry of European and American countries in China. Taking the first two reasons, Japan detained nine Portuguese merchant ships in the Zhejiang sea area this time, and the detention has been going on for several days. The inspection has been carried out many times. May I ask how many genuine guerrillas has Japan discovered? How many armaments are there? To take a step back, if European and American merchant ships really do carry Chinese guerrillas and armaments as Japan claims, but Japan has not declared war on China, on what article of international law can it prohibit European and American merchant ships from freely carrying passengers and cargo? If the ships' nationalities are unclear, these ships have been sailing along the coast for a long time. Why didn't Japan conduct a detailed investigation with the various European and American diplomatic missions in China in advance? Why did it have to detain them in the ocean? And if the detained European and American merchant ships are genuinely Chinese ships operating under false flags, British warships and Portuguese consuls would not have protested to the Japanese side. The fact that British warships and Portuguese consuls have protested is enough to prove that they are indeed British and Portuguese ships. Japan, however, disregards the protests of British warships and Portuguese consuls. Japan clearly believes that British warships and Portuguese consuls are helping Chinese ships operate under false flags, which is a major insult to Britain and Portugal!</p>
<p>During the current Sino-Japanese War, the damage suffered by European and American personnel from Japan's sabotage of the coastal shipping industry in China is actually very limited. However, from this, we can see Japan's determination to eradicate European and American power in China, and we can see that all of Japan's guarantees are worth absolutely nothing. Yesterday, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma gave a speech at the so-called "Asia Development Board," saying that Japan had no intention of interfering with the rights and interests of third parties in the Far East, but only to the extent that it did not endanger Japan's national defense and interests. Then isn't the detention of European and American merchant ships by Japanese warships an interference with the rights and interests of third parties? Could it be that these detained British and Portuguese merchant ships are in any way harmful to Japan's national defense? If European and American countries want to protect what little remains of their rights and interests in China, only practical action is the most effective method. In the past, Britain and the United States tried to protect the free passage of merchant ships with warships in China. Now they should extend this approach, such as the method of dividing defense zones by British and French warships in the Mediterranean in the past, and send warships to protect the free navigation of merchant ships from interference, so as to protect rights and interests. Otherwise, not to mention that navigation on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers will be permanently hopeless, even coastal shipping may be difficult to maintain in the future!</p>
<h3 id="e5">Guerrilla Warfare in Shanxi: Ammunition is Not a Problem, Output from Mobile Armories is Increasing Daily; Bombs are Available in Endless Supply <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>A certain place in Shanxi: The mobile armories in Shanxi province use railway steel rails obtained by the Chinese army and guerrilla teams as raw materials to manufacture rifles, and the output is increasing daily. I had the opportunity to carefully examine the products of these armories. The Taiyuan Arsenal in Shanxi province is one of the largest of its kind in China. It was occupied by the Japanese army more than a year ago. The tens of thousands of workers employed in the factory have long been scattered throughout the province. Those who are manufacturing ammunition in remote mountain areas today are the same people. Their products are mostly bombs, rifles, and pistols. If necessary, their manufacturing equipment can be dismantled and transported away by mules within two hours. There are quite a few of these manufacturing sites. Each major political region has a large one, and there are twenty or thirty small ones that are allied with various groups. The numbers of products cannot be announced, of course, but it is said that in a certain political region alone, an average of 10,000 bombs and 200 rifles can be manufactured every day, and can be increased if necessary. Rifles are mostly made from railway steel rails, and bombs are made of iron. Students who have returned from Europe with high metallurgical skills supervise the workers to forge iron in the local method. All manufacturing sites are located in remote areas. My free time is limited, so I cannot personally visit them and see their contents, but I had the good fortune to meet technicians engaged in this work, and I was able to talk to them and carefully examine the samples they produced. It is said that steel rails are soft, which is the main difficulty in manufacturing guns. Later, a method of making hardened steel was obtained, which made things much easier. Now, the main product is bombs, which this province can use endlessly. Even if transportation is cut off for a long period of time, the Chinese army can still rely on these things to carry out the war. An official said that the Japanese army will never be able to cut off our ammunition supply. Every farmer knows how to make gunpowder, because this thing was originally invented in China. Even without detonators, a fuse can be used instead. With these bombs, we can acquire better Japanese weapons, and make the Japanese army unable to use their exquisite weapons any longer. An old-fashioned German hand grenade used in the European War is now a treasure for the Chinese army. At night, when the Japanese army's exquisite weapons lose their effectiveness, the Chinese army often uses these hand grenades to attack the Japanese army. The Chinese army is well-informed, which is due to the nature of the people, so they know in detail every action of the Japanese army, even where the senior officers are located. Moreover, the Chinese army is familiar with the local geography, so even on the darkest nights, they can grope their way to attack the enemy. Once they find their target, they can retreat safely. There are more than a dozen of these attacks every night. The gains from each attack are, of course, very small, but when taken together, the results are quite considerable. When I returned to General Yan Xishan's headquarters, I saw the rifles and pistols made by hand in the Shanxi armories. The rifles were beautifully made. Except for their smooth barrels, they were very similar to those made by machines. There were also two pistol specimens made by the armories of two major counties, one was an 11-millimeter automatic pistol modified from the White Langlin style, made from steel rails obtained from the Tongpu Railway, which was very sharp, and the other was completely handmade, using German Mauser bullets. The construction was very good, and any gun expert would admire it. It was shaped like a Mauser but smaller, and was entirely designed by local workers. It is said that several hundred of these pistols can be made every month, and the number can be increased or decreased as needed. (Special dispatch from the Reuters correspondent, April 7)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Residents Flee, Never to Return; Japanese Forge Paper Money <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>A certain place in Shanxi: A reporter met with a county magistrate of a certain county along the railway line in Jin Province in a certain city near the railway line. According to him, "There are 130 villages and towns under my jurisdiction, of which the Japanese only occupy seven. In addition, there are six villages and towns between the Fen River and the Tongpu Railway that have also been invaded by Japanese forces. However, our administrative organs in these areas are still secretly working. The county seat under my jurisdiction has been looted and burned to the ground. In the past, there were 5,000 residents and more than 200 shops, but now it has become a wasteland. Only three households of residents remain. Even the Japanese army does not want to come to this land again. The residents of the county seat have scattered and fled, and their businesses have been completely destroyed. However, if the county government needs funds, it can raise them within a few days. Currently, all expenses of the county government have been greatly reduced, with a total of only 100 yuan per month, which is just enough for food. County government personnel are not paid. Zhao Zhu, an important town on the railway line south of Linfen, has now established a puppet 'local government.' There is only one person working there, an opium addict who used to run a business but is now bankrupt. The Japanese have advertised that if the women of the city's residents return home, they will rebuild their houses for free, but no one has responded. Sometimes the Japanese army threatens to burn the entire city if the residents do not return, but as a result, only a few elderly men reluctantly return, while young women and children still hesitate to come forward."</p>
<p>The county magistrate continued to describe the Japanese efforts to consolidate their financial position, saying that the Japanese army considers it a crime for people in occupied areas to possess more than 30 yuan in Chinese legal tender, and anyone with more than 100 yuan is shot. However, the people still refuse to use Japanese paper money. Not long ago, several Japanese were engaged in currency exchange along the railway line, willing to exchange 90 cents of Chinese legal tender for one yuan of Japanese currency. Their purpose was probably to establish a "black market exchange rate" because the Chinese consider Japanese currency to be worthless, so they wanted to let the Chinese people know that Japanese currency still had some value. Currently, the Japanese have abandoned this method. If the Chinese exchange Japanese currency, they will be given 1.1 or 1.2 yuan of counterfeit Chinese paper money for every yuan of Chinese legal tender. The Japanese are now importing large amounts of counterfeit paper money into Shanxi in an attempt to undermine the credibility of Chinese legal tender, but we will never be deceived by them. As the county magistrate spoke, he handed the reporter a counterfeit five-yuan note from the Shanxi Provincial Bank, instructing him to compare it with the genuine one. This kind of counterfeit money has thicker paper and is easily identifiable, and the color is also lighter than the genuine one. The county magistrate continued, saying that while the currency problem has already caused considerable difficulty, the lack of domestic goods supply is even more serious. The business of governance has virtually come to a complete halt, so unless small-scale industries can be successfully established, the people will be forced to use Japanese currency to buy Japanese goods.

<h3 id="e7">Wu Jingheng Writes an Article, Questioning Wang Jingwei (3): Accusing the Communist Party of Creating Trouble, Sowing Discord, and Handing Over Chahar with Both Hands—A Memory <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) (C) Mr. Wang claims that "What I sincerely seek is a century-long plan for East Asia. I have seen through and determined that open warfare between China and Japan will harm both sides, while peace will allow them to coexist." He also says, "It is clear and obvious, right in front of us. Are there any ambitious people in both countries who, intimidated by temporary misfortunes and reputations, hesitate and look around, and dare not make a clear choice?" Mr. Wang actually acts as if he is a person of worth, a revolutionary youth, a party leader, an orator, a poet, and a traitor. He has transformed himself again into an old priest. And your heroic Madam Chen, she has recently been lamenting how the people suffer in the war, forgetting that she helped you fight fiercely in Hankou and Beiping, looking like a pious old woman who has lived for generations. It is a pity that you two are secretly encouraging "comrades" to stir up minor disturbances, preparing to organize a "central government," hoping to steal power and use it as a stepping stone for you to advance towards the enemy. People cannot help but see through your masks and know that you are crying crocodile tears, which is actually laughable. It is better to advise you to take good care of your young head that is quick to draw a knife, and always be honest. (D) What Mr. Wang least believes in is honesty. His ambition is to achieve unparalleled heights. It is almost as if, if there were a God in the universe, he would want to surpass God. In fact, no matter how well he learns Sun Wukong's ability to change, he can never change that tail. People see him as just an animal. What is his tail after all? It is the "immature" green youth, the orator who does not understand logic, the bookworm who searches for phrases and sentences, and the ordinary man who loves a few dirty coins. I used to call him a hypocrite, but I fell for his tricks. Party leader and traitor are just temporary titles he occupies. Eventually, he will be kicked away, picked up by the tail, and transformed again, from the extreme left to the extreme right, from the extreme high to the extreme low, from the extreme fragrant to the extreme smelly. He does not care. He himself thinks that he has "seen through" and changes immediately. He has seen through that the revolution is coming from the left, and feels that he is certainly not a match for Lenin, Trotsky, or the Trinity, or Stalin. He has also seen through the century-long plan for East Asia and believes that at least Hitler, Mussolini, and young soldiers will be under his control. People say that Jingwei has already joined a certain group. He is acting as a high-ranking traitor, which is not as simple as Qin Hui or Li Wanyong. Therefore, the iron statues of Qin Hui and Madam Wang by the West Lake are not enough for them. At least tungsten steel should be prepared for their weight. We do not know what will happen next, so let us see how he transforms again. What I lament now is that since he knows that "advocating peace will not hinder unification, and not advocating peace will not cause division," how can others not see this? People can only answer you by saying that advocating war will not cause division. Who is using the War of Resistance to achieve unification? What are you opposing? You are trying to incite your "comrades" to create a small disturbance for the enemy. If you stir up a small disturbance in the country at this time, can you still handle this transformation? What kind of tinplate should we use to prepare for your centenary memorial?</p>
<p>China's unification through the War of Resistance is a new term that everyone readily uses. No one created this term to fight the war. When asked about the content of this term, it means that, except for a very small number of animal-like traitors, all Chinese people are patriots. I will also give an example. The Political Council, which you presided over, is a gathering of representatives from various parties and factions, unified by the War of Resistance. Everyone remembers the weakening of national power due to past divisions, so once united, they will not divide again. Therefore, you can also believe that "advocating peace will not hinder unification, and not advocating peace will not cause division." Unification also includes the Communist Party's obedience to the Three Principles of the People and support for the National Government, and they are also fighting the war together. You believe that the Communist Party is inherently disruptive. You also say that the Communist Party can "come to the surface," but until now, we have only seen you openly surrendering, and we have not seen the Communist Party openly causing trouble. The Communist Party can come to the surface, but you have not even come to the surface. You just want to promote yourself and create internal strife, plot to harm the country, provide benefits to the enemy, and satisfy your personal desires. The ancients said, "If a man is clean, he should be promoted. If he is clean together, he should not be dismissed." We only know that they are Chinese people who obey the Three Principles of the People, support the National Government, and fight the war together. That is all. England, which the Communist Party wants to overthrow first, can still cooperate with the Soviet Union because of the democratic bloc. China discriminates against Chinese people who advocate democracy and obey the Three Principles of the People. How can this be? You have promoted democracy all your life, but you have seen through the actions of the anti-democratic bloc and want to jump ship immediately. You mention communism or non-communism, but you just want to say that China supports communism and should be "punished" by aggressive countries that use anti-communism as a pretext. You say, "If the Communist Party's disturbances come to the surface when advocating peace, it would be better than the current situation of manipulating, controlling, and sowing discord." This sentence clearly announces your own plan, which is to hope that the Communist Party does not cause trouble, so you come to do the work of manipulating, controlling, and sowing discord first. If the Communist Party falls into your trap and causes trouble, your opportunity will come. What is it? It is that you can borrow the name of seeking foreign aid to borrow Japanese soldiers to quell internal strife. Isn't this kind of intention Wu Sangui of the Ming Dynasty or Li Wanyong of Korea? You are acting perversely to such an extent. Do you still have any conscience? You have been sitting in the Central Party Headquarters for more than a day. Who does not follow you to "persuade Communist friends with good intentions and wish them to come to the surface naturally and jointly build a country based on the Three Principles of the People?" What are you intending to publicly mention it to the enemy in particular? You advocate a peace agreement that betrays the country, and you also have the ability to make them come to the surface, and everyone loves the country with them. You have no way to make them come to the surface. What kind of logic is this? Well, please, you who are not inherently disruptive, search your conscience and see through less. Honestly be your number one young man who is quick to draw a knife. I have offended you, and I am willing to be punished by you in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, I will also return you "an example." You should remember that when you were the President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China, didn't the Japanese warlords demand the removal of Chairman Song Zheyuan of Chahar? You received the demands of the Japanese warlords, and without asking anyone, without asking how, and without asking what mistakes Chairman Song Zheyuan had made, and whether he should be removed or not, you used your sincere diplomacy, responsible spirit, and extraordinary vision and means to quickly issue an order overnight to remove Chairman Song. You bowed to the Japanese warlords, obeyed their orders, and handed over the entire sovereignty of Chahar to the Japanese warlords in less than 24 hours. The Japanese warlords acquired Chahar peacefully without spending a single bullet or shedding a drop of blood. Do you see any difference between this and President Hacha handing over Czechoslovakia last month? Calculating the time, your brilliant and rapid diplomatic means of handing over Chahar were much faster than the handing over of Czechoslovakia. I do not know how many other practical examples there are. I only cite this one example, which is enough to show your high opinion, foresight, and diplomatic genius, and your ability to betray power to the enemy in a responsible and sincere manner and humiliate the country. Mr. Wang, you are so responsible and sincere to the Japanese warlords. How could the Japanese warlords be willing to give you up? Among the 450 million Chinese people, no one else can be found except you. Therefore, they found Wang Kemin and Liang Hongzhi, but they were not enough. They had to say to you that only you, Mr. Wang, can be their negotiating opponent. This is no wonder they say that because they did not intend to seduce you or harm you intentionally, but to benefit themselves and make it easier for them to destroy China. And you really do not intend to harm Japan, but they see your way of handing over Chahar so quickly, which can not but make their ambition to destroy China more pronounced and their spirit of humiliating China particularly high. Therefore, they gain an inch and want a mile, so that the Japanese warlords are inexplicably happy and remember why, and even disregard their own traditional policies and supreme military strategy.</p>
<p>Until the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, they still thought that the Chinese only respond to force and not gentleness, so they sent troops into the customs, recklessly burned and killed in Tianjin, and occupied Beiping. They still delusionally thought that our National Government was the same as when you were the President of the Executive Yuan in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China. As long as they use force to threaten and entice, they can sign a surrender and easily get North China. Not only that, they also... In their hearts, they sent troops to Shanghai to attack Nanjing until they occupied Guangzhou and Wuhan. Mr. Wang, do you know what this is? I am afraid you still do not understand. This is to wait for you to come out and be the opponent of the National Government. But they have arrived in Wuhan, and you are still unwilling to come out to be their opponent. Do you really want them to fight to Xi'an and Nanning before you are willing to overthrow the National Government and be their opponent? If they arrive in Xi'an and Nanning, they will suffer many casualties and spend a lot of military expenses, and they will spend all of their 600 million war budget for this year. If they cannot capture Xi'an and Nanning at this time, or if they capture them but you still do not come out to overthrow the National Government and be their opponent, then you, Mr. Wang, are really harming them and are really sorry for them. At this time, your good friend, the Japanese military, will definitely question you and ask whether your "establishment of a long-term peace and stability in East Asia for a hundred years" and "another path of common survival and common development" in "an example" are not deceiving people. If you are afraid that you cannot answer by that time, I will help you think that you only need to say, "I am Chinese, and we use deception in war. I am doing this now because you have failed, but this is enough to be 'a long-term peace and stability in East Asia for a hundred years' and 'another path of common survival and common development.'" If you answer him like this, will you not become a famous statesman in history? If this is really the result, then in our future history of the Sino-Japanese War, on the day that the Republic of China gains independence, freedom, territorial sovereignty, and administrative integrity, will your first contribution not be recorded on the first page? What are you afraid of having grievances that cannot be cleared? I think that if you want to serve the country and make a name for yourself, and leave a legacy for future generations, you can only do this. This is the first method that your old comrade has thought of for you. Besides this, there is only a dead end. Please cherish it and do not take the wrong path. If you get to the point where you take a wrong step and regret it for a thousand years, it will be too late to regret. Goodbye. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e9">British Reporter Praises the Yunnan-Burma Highway <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Chinese government's procurement committee in London recently ordered various construction materials worth 180,000 pounds from several British firms for the Yunnan-Burma Railway. It is reported that the construction of the railway is currently being carried out actively, and there are still other transactions under negotiation. According to news from Chinese sources in London, the route of the Yunnan-Burma Railway follows the one suggested by British engineers forty years ago. Recently, a reporter from The Times traveled by car on the highway from Lashio to Kunming and published an article detailing his impressions of the excellent achievements of the Chinese engineers. According to the report, the total length of the highway is 124 miles from Lashio to the border and 648 miles from the border to Kunming. The 367-mile section of the highway within China, from Xiaguan to the border, was only started in October 1937. Although the altitude there is between 2,000 and 8,000 feet above sea level, it was completed in 14 months and can be used for lighter vehicles. The section of the highway from Longling to the Salween Valley is the worst, passing through mountains 8,000 feet high, with steep slopes and bends. The outside of the highway is also adjacent to steep mountain walls as deep as 2,000 feet. At present, countless man-hours have been spent on this section of the highway, but landslides often occur due to geological reasons. The suspension bridge across the Salween Valley, which is 280 feet wide, was recently completed and is now being rebuilt to allow heavier vehicles to pass. According to the reporter, if the highway is to support heavy traffic during the rainy season, adequate ditches must be dug on the inside of the road to drain the accumulated water. The reporter praised the achievements of the Chinese engineers, saying that travelers in Yunnan Province have unlimited admiration for the determination and perseverance of the Chinese.

<h3 id="e13">Roosevelt Warns Totalitarian Countries: If War Breaks Out in Europe, the U.S. Cannot Avoid Being Involved; U.S. Strength Far Greater Than Germany and Italy; British Newspapers Say Don't Easily Believe Panic-Mongering News <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt met with newspaper reporters today and hinted at the possibility of the United States being drawn into the European war. It is noted that when President Roosevelt left his hometown of Warm Springs to return to the capital, he told his neighbors, "If we do not have a war, I will still return home in the autumn." The Washington Post commented that this was a warning to the totalitarian countries, saying that "any war they start will draw in a country whose strength is greater than that of Germany and Italy." The New York Times' headline stated that President Roosevelt said that the U.S. would be drawn into the whirlpool, which is in line with the idea that we cannot stand aloof from the great war." The New York Forum for Public Opinion also stated that President Roosevelt's words were a warning to the aggressors. President Roosevelt made a clearer statement to reporters today, saying that the Washington Post's commentary was excellent, clear, and honest, and future generations would know the true meaning of what I said. (Associated Press on the 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times published a commentary entitled "Disturbed Europe" and the Daily Telegraph also published a commentary entitled "Tensions in Europe", both discussing the alarming events in the current international situation, but saying that the panic-mongering news that accompanies the tense situation has become a new diplomatic technique of the aggressor countries. The Times said that this kind of news should not be believed entirely, but rather considered as a trick of those who are creating and trying to take advantage of this situation. U.S. President Roosevelt's interpretation of an article in the Washington Post is very significant, saying that the intentional threat to Western culture will involve the fate of the United States, which is probably the most direct warning ever heard. The President's Office and the State Department share this view, and most Americans seem to think so as well. (Reuters telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) When President Roosevelt met with newspaper reporters today, the reporters asked him to express his opinion on the international situation. The President immediately replied that the article published by the Washington Post today, which commented on his remarks in Warm Springs, was "clear and honest," and that everyone should read it. According to the newspaper, the President said when he left Warm Springs, "If we do not encounter war before this fall, then I will come back here again." Does this mean that the U.S. will join the war, or does it mean that a war will break out on the other side of the Atlantic? If we think carefully about the President's words, we will know that the word "we" used by the President refers to the countries of Western civilization. Any war that harms Western civilization, regardless of whether our country participates in it or not, will have a vital impact on our country. "At this time, if the countries that believe in freedom can take a firm attitude in time, war can be avoided. The pressure exerted by the Rome-Berlin Axis on other countries will not be relaxed unless it encounters real resistance. Countries can only deal with it with consistent firmness, which can force it to adopt a compromising and sincere attitude. In short, force is the only creed of the dictators, and only by showing stronger force can their barbaric actions be stopped. Under this kind of situation, the United States will naturally become a powerful factor. President Roosevelt has indicated to the Axis countries that our country will not sit idly by and ignore the conspiracies of these countries, and has clearly pointed out that any war that is started by the Axis countries will immediately involve the United States. At the same time, there is another level that needs to be noted, that is, the strength of the United States is much stronger than the combined strength of Germany and Italy. This is a fact, and if it is stated frankly at this time, it will benefit the prevention of war. In short, dealing with the dictators with a tough attitude is the best way to prevent war. Recently, France has strengthened its current policy, and the United Kingdom has also decided on the final "limit of retreat," which are all due to this kind of argument. President Roosevelt wants the United States to intervene at the last minute to prevent war, and his starting point is also the same. " Generally, people are now commenting on President Roosevelt's citation of the Washington Post, saying that since the President fully agrees with the opinions expressed by the newspaper and wants to use this to warn the Rome-Berlin Axis countries, this can be seen.

<h3 id="e14">Americans Support Boycott of German Goods <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The Institute of Public Opinion conducted a survey on the issue of boycotting German goods. The question posed was, "Do you support participating in the national boycott of German goods?" The results of the survey have now been revealed. A total of 65 percent supported participation, while 35 percent opposed it. According to reports, this question has been surveyed more than once. When it was conducted in October of last year, only 56 percent supported it. By the time it was surveyed in December of last year, the number of supporters had increased to 61 percent. It can be seen that the number of Americans supporting the boycott of German goods is increasing day by day. In addition, the Institute also surveyed public opinion on the issue of imposing additional tariffs on imports of German goods. As a result, 78 percent supported it. (According to reports, since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the U.S. government has ordered that, starting from the 23rd of this month, an additional tariff of 25 percent be levied on most imports from Germany.)

<p>(London) After the Easter holiday, when European stock exchanges reopened, prices generally saw a sharp decline. This was expected. The Paris exchange saw significant selling, with government bonds falling by one to two pounds. In Amsterdam, Netherlands, major securities fell by as much as fifteen pounds. However, after Prime Minister Colijn's speech was released, confidence was somewhat restored. Although prices on the London Stock Exchange fell, there was no heavy selling pressure. Most British bondholders are unwilling to exacerbate the situation. Due to the shock in Continental Europe, a large number of sales were originally expected, but it is now known that the number is small, which is also encouraging. Although there was a rush to sell major currencies on the London foreign exchange market, the market was not affected and remained relatively stable. However, some people in Amsterdam were bidding for US dollars, causing the price of the Dutch guilder to fall. Later, the Dutch equalization fund sold a large number of US dollars, and the guilder price was maintained. (Reuter, 11th)</p>

<p>(London) Several members of the cabinet, especially Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon and Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, have a plan, the main idea of which is that Britain invites Italy to jointly guarantee the status quo of the Balkan Peninsula, in exchange for the country withdrawing its troops from Spain. They also hope to establish a Mediterranean pact, but the dispute between Italy and France must be resolved first. Otherwise, this pact can only be limited to the eastern Mediterranean. The details of the above plan are still unknown. The British government will definitely do its best to make it successful. Its intention is, even if it does not dismantle the Rome-Berlin Axis, at least to prevent Italy from blindly following Germany's lead. In addition, Bulgarian Minister to Britain Momtchiloff visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon to inform him that Bulgaria does not intend to destroy the existing agreements between Bulgaria and other Balkan countries, and Bulgaria is also opposed to any interference from countries outside the Balkan Peninsula. If so, maintaining the status quo of the Balkan Peninsula will be facilitated. This is also one of the reasons why the European situation is easing. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini sent a letter to Prime Minister Chamberlain yesterday, explaining the country's actions in Albania, saying that this move does not contradict the Anglo-Italian Agreement, and that the country's ambition is for peace. Once General Franco triumphantly enters Madrid on May 2, the remaining 25,000 soldiers will withdraw from Spain. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee discussed this matter at 3:00 this afternoon. Those present included Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Home Secretary Hoare, Lord Chancellor Inskip, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Morrison, and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Alexander Cadogan. It is heard that because Italy has promised to respect the territorial integrity of Greece and has now provided guarantees on the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers, it has been decided that it is not necessary to abolish the Anglo-Italian Agreement, so that the door to negotiations will not be closed as a result. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Prime Minister's residence and the Foreign Office today firmly denied the rumor that Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had private contacts. (Reuter, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office issued a communiqué today denying that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had sent any letter to Prime Minister Chamberlain. Political figures commented on the communiqué, saying that the cabinet did indeed discuss this letter during the small group meeting yesterday, and even some cabinet members therefore advocated caution. All the newspapers in the country also firmly believed that this was the case, and the Foreign Office's denial was probably intended to indicate that the government did not want to use this document as a basis for discussion. Therefore, the denial is only important in domestic politics. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's letter to British Prime Minister Chamberlain, stating that the country has no intention of changing the status quo in the Mediterranean, has been commented on by diplomatic figures here. Whether this statement is sincere depends on whether the country fulfills the Anglo-Italian Agreement and withdraws all its troops from Spain. Regarding this matter, the British government has repeatedly asked the Italian government to provide formal guarantees, but the Italian authorities have only made verbal guarantees. Their intention is not sincere, but only to ease any actions that Britain may take in the Mediterranean. When war breaks out in Europe, Italy may even use its troops stationed in Spain to attack the British port of Gibraltar, and then attack the international neutral port of Tangier. If so, it would seriously affect the communication lines between these ports and the British Empire, which Britain will never passively wait for, but must meet with a counterattack. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e21">The Greek Question <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Athens The Italian Minister to Greece delivered a note to the Greek government today, stating that "Italy sincerely hopes to establish close and friendly relations with Greece." Italy has no intention of attacking Greece, and hopes that Greece will not doubt this sincerity. It should be known that the various rumors arising from the Albanian incident were spread by "Italy's enemies." In short, the Italian government is willing to guarantee the integrity of Greece's territory and islands. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government solemnly provided Greece with a guarantee on the 10th of this month, stating that it would respect the territorial integrity of the country. Greek Minister to Italy Metaxas expressed his gratitude to the Italian government. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons reconvenes on the 13th of this month, Prime Minister Chamberlain is expected to issue a statement saying that Britain will regard any threat to Greece as an unfriendly act. However, it is not yet known whether the same statement will be issued to Turkey to provide guarantees. It is also said that the guarantees that the British government intends to provide to Greece are unilateral in nature and do not constitute a mutual assistance agreement, as Britain and Poland did previously. It is also reported that the Spanish parliament established a friendly treaty with Germany and Italy on the 23rd or 24th of last month, containing a non-aggression clause, but without special military mutual assistance clauses. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Responsible figures here recently stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to announce in the House of Commons tomorrow that guarantees will be given to Greece. The motive for this move is, on the one hand, to establish a collective security system to resist future aggression, and on the other hand, to maintain Britain's strategic interests. If something happens in the future, Greece becoming one of Britain's front lines is no different from Belgium, the Rhineland in France, and Portugal, Egypt, and Iraq becoming Britain's front lines. If this is the case, then Italy's occupation of Albania, regardless of the reason, is enough to threaten Britain, which is undeniable. Therefore, in order to maintain its operational capabilities in the eastern Mediterranean, the British Navy cannot and should not ignore this threat. As far as the current situation is concerned, the number of bases that the British Navy can use in the eastern Mediterranean is very small. It is allowed that between the British island of Malta and the Suez Canal, there is only the port of Alexandria that can accommodate large warships. Other ports, such as Port Said in Egypt, Haifa in Palestine, and Cyprus, can only accommodate a small number of warships. Therefore, if Greek ports can be used by the British fleet in wartime, it will be of great benefit. Although the movement of British warships to these ports is not actually restricted, if Britain and Greece can establish a mutual assistance agreement so that Britain can use these strategic locations according to the treaty, it would be a wise move. This is why Britain is eager to give guarantees to Greece first. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures here recently commented on the situation in the Balkan Peninsula, stating that although Italy has given guarantees to Greece, declaring that it will not invade, it must be in exchange for the country not participating in the "encirclement" policy promoted by Britain. Therefore, if the mutual guarantees between Britain and Poland are extended to the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, then Italy, in addition to occupying Albania, should further expand its influence into the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea basin. Italy's position is such that the newspapers have revealed it to warn Greece, Turkey, Romania, and even Yugoslavia not to join the collective security organization advocated by Britain, which would bring disaster upon themselves. The newspapers here said that if Turkey and Greece provide ports for foreign fleets to use, Italy will never tolerate it. Among them, the "Padano Post" also hopes that Romania, Turkey, and Greece will follow the example of Yugoslavia and treat Italy with understanding. Otherwise, "Albania has become a vassal of Italy, and has become Italy's strategic base in the Adriatic Sea, and will become Italy's bridge to extend its influence into the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea."

Its content is to appeal to the people to prepare to make sacrifices. This article should be based on official authorization. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Informed political figures here recently stated that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop explained Germany's views on the mutual assistance agreement agreed upon by Britain and Poland when he met with Polish Ambassador Lipski on the 7th of this month. According to German figures here, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop told Ambassador Lipski that Britain's guarantee to Poland contradicts the spirit of the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Once the verbal agreement agreed upon by Britain and Poland becomes a written agreement, the German government will have to reconsider the entire situation. As for the military measures taken by the Polish government, Germany considers them to be "unfriendly" actions. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Polish Ambassador Lipski, who recently returned home, is reportedly that the German government did not put forward concrete suggestions for the outstanding issues between Germany and Poland. Only the "People's Observer" recently published an article explaining Germany's various requirements to Poland. Outsiders were unaware and thought that the German government had made various requests to Ambassador Lipski. In fact, the various opinions mentioned in the newspaper had already been explained to the Warsaw government by German Ambassador to Poland Moltke two weeks ago. Ambassador Lipski has not returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since he had a meeting with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the 7th of this month to discuss Poland's military measures (it is rumored that the conversation that day was quite tense). Afterwards, he returned home to report on his duties, and has remained there until now. It is estimated that Lipski can return here tomorrow. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Council of Ministers met at 10:00 this morning, presided over by President Lebrun, and approved the draft declaration, which will be issued by Prime Minister Daladier in the name of the French government tomorrow, to explain France's attitude towards the European situation. At the meeting, Prime Minister Daladier reported on the general situation and proposed various necessary military measures to adapt to international events, which were immediately approved by the Council of Ministers. It was decided that Foreign Minister Bonnet would report on France's recent diplomatic activities, emphasizing the necessity of France's cooperation with Britain in diplomacy, and explaining the main principles on which France's current attitude is based. Before attending the Council of Ministers meeting, Foreign Minister Bonnet met with British Ambassador Sir Phipps. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Before the cabinet meeting this afternoon, Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet both consulted with General Pétain, the French Ambassador to Spain, who had just returned from Burgos. According to political sources, what General Pétain wanted to discuss included the following matters: (1) Italy's failure to withdraw its troops in Spain, (2) Spain's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact, and (3) the slow pace of the Spanish government's repatriation of refugees in France. At the same time, it is heard that negotiations between France and the Spanish government have proven to be not easy, as the Spanish government is currently taking a strict approach to the refugee issue, and will not allow refugees in France to return to the country until the French side fulfills the Bérat Agreement, which stipulates the return of jewels and arms. Regarding this issue, many events must go through legal procedures, so it is considered quite difficult. It is heard that the Spanish army is currently building fortifications on the border of French Morocco, and is quite busy. However, this matter has not caused much concern among the French, because Italy's actions in Albania have made Muslims inclined to France even more than before. (Reuter, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet held a cabinet meeting at 4:00 this afternoon to discuss the situation, which lasted until 6:30. According to responsible sources, Foreign Minister Bonnet gave a detailed report on the current diplomatic situation, and the cabinet immediately approved the various measures decided by the Standing Committee on National Defense yesterday, and formulated other measures, which will be submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval tomorrow, so as to strengthen national defense and prepare for any eventuality. In addition, Prime Minister Daladier met with Ambassador to Spain General Pétain before the cabinet meeting, and held talks with Foreign Minister Bonnet and Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac after the meeting.

Furthermore, I believe Guam should be fortified immediately. Once fortified, Japan would never dare to venture past the island.

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army spokesperson stated at a press conference at 6:00 PM yesterday that the Chinese army in southern Shanxi launched a major counteroffensive from the 9th of this month, attacking Yongcheng, Anyi, and Xia County in several directions. The spokesperson claimed that the Japanese army had repelled the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army's losses listed by the spokesperson were extremely small, possibly due to the Chinese army's night attacks. The Japanese side now feels that a major battle will soon occur in the southeastern part of Shanxi Province because Wei Lihuang's troops have already crossed the Yellow River and are advancing. The Japanese side anticipates that Wei Lihuang's troops appear to be attempting to cut off the Pu Railway line south of Taiyuan, isolating the Japanese army in Taiyuan. The Chinese troops who crossed the river this time (2) are from the Sichuan army. The aforementioned Sichuan army crossed the Yellow River from the west of the Tongpu Railway, and a portion of the Sichuan troops has joined the front lines and begun fighting, as evidenced by the battles in Yongcheng, Anyi, and Xia County. The Japanese side believes that the quality of the Chinese troops who crossed the river this time is not sufficient.

According to Japanese sources in Beiping, the "murderers" in this assassination must have been Chinese who infiltrated the Japanese army in Kaifeng, but as of late last night, the investigation had not yielded any clues.

<h3 id="e33">Japanese Army in North China Oppresses Farmers, Imposing Exactions and Taxes; Each Household Required to Provide One Railroad Tie; Villages Near Railroads Subjected to Burning <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported yesterday (10th) information obtained by foreigners observing in the vicinity of Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai: The Japanese military and semi-military authorities in North China have begun a widespread program of building roads and railways. Consequently, the Japanese army has altered its attitude toward Chinese farmers in the region and is now apparently attempting to win their sympathy. The Japanese army authorities have ordered soldiers to cease their previous brutal treatment of civilians. Thus, incidents of killing, assault, and rape have significantly decreased. The Japanese army is also attempting to gain the goodwill of the Chinese by claiming to protect them from rampant rural bandits. However, the situation of Chinese farmers remains dire, as they are still forced to endure exactions and taxes, adding to their already heavy burden of war. A prominent example of these exactions is the Japanese army's requirement that each household provide one railroad tie for the construction of new railways. Even foreign churches are subject to similar "taxes." Under these circumstances, foreign churches find it advisable to "cooperate" with the Japanese army. As a result, railway stations along the lines are filled with railroad ties, and the trees in the countryside are almost completely depleted. Farmers who still have trees after delivering railroad ties cut them down for firewood, fearing that the Japanese army will forcibly seize them. Although railway operations continue on schedule, they require special security due to the activities of guerrillas. The railway lines are heavily guarded, and bunkers made of earth and sandbags have been built at each station and bridge. A railway branch line has even more solid fortifications, with trenches every 200 yards. Jinan itself is a major fortress, surrounded by three layers of barbed wire and a military road built specifically for rapidly transporting troops to any attacked location. The construction of these fortifications is proceeding at full speed. Jinan is clearly becoming one of the most important bases for the Japanese army in the region. Farmers in the vicinity of Jinan can profit from engaging in construction work, but those living near the railways are less fortunate, as the Japanese army retaliates against them for guerrilla attacks. Villages near railways attacked by guerrillas are burned down. The Japanese army has also published notices in local newspapers stating that they will not only burn down entire villages but also kill all men between the ages of ten and forty.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Conditions After the Fall of Wuhan: A Traveler's Account <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Guilin Correspondence: Recently, a friend who had traveled from Wuhan through guerrilla areas arrived here. He claims to have left the French Concession in Hankou on March 7, with a group of five people. It took them a total of fifteen days to travel the route. He reported on many aspects of the situation after the fall of Wuhan. A summary is recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese Construction Work: The enemy invaded Wuhan on December 26 at dawn. On the morning of December 26, the compatriots of Wuhan did not expect that the enemy would quickly attack Wuhan. It was only on the morning of the 26th that the distant sound of gunfire was heard from the river. Fifty or sixty enemy warships sailed up the Yangtze River from the lower reaches. Small motorboats were in front of the warships, and a large number of fighter planes flew low overhead, strafing to protect the warships' advance. Japanese officers and soldiers stood proudly on the bows of the ships, all wearing yellow uniforms. They landed ashore in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Our demolition work was not done well enough. The enemy quickly restored the radio station and hydroelectric power plant. The fortifications we had previously built along the river were used by the enemy, who added very thick steel plates to them, making them very strong, to guard against our future counterattacks.</p>
<p>Occupation Under Iron Heel: Regarding the situation in Wuhan, the enemy designated Districts 1, 2, and 3 of Hankou as commercial areas and the model area as a military area. Only Japanese were allowed to live in these three districts. The area along Minsheng Road was designated as a Sino-Japanese district, where Chinese could reside. The Japanese Concession was completely burned down for fear of guerrilla hiding. They made use of the old shops, such as those along Zhongshan Road. Whatever business they did before, they are still operated by the Japanese now.</p>
<p>The cost of living in Wuhan is extremely high. Rice in the concession sells for 20 yuan per dan, coal for 16 yuan per dan, and two small radishes cost one yuan. Other daily necessities are even more expensive. One yuan and two jiao of Chinese currency can be exchanged for one yuan of Japanese military scrip. It goes without saying that Japanese goods sell well in Wuhan. Japanese canned goods are very cheap; one yuan can buy five cans. Apples and the like can be bought for ten for one yuan. Items such as silk, printed cloth, medicines, and clocks are scattered in various shops.</p>
<p>French Concession Has Capitulated: When the Japanese army first entered Wuhan, the attitude of the French Concession authorities was quite strong. Later, the Japanese army blockaded the French Concession, and the French Concession authorities had to make concessions step by step. Now, Japanese military police arrest pedestrians in the concession at any time. Annamite soldiers guard the gates of the French Concession, not allowing any food to be transported into the concession. If pedestrians are found carrying food into the concession, they are forced to kneel on the ground with the food on their heads, unable to get up for the whole day.</p>
<p>Because the concession was blockaded, the more than 100,000 residents in the concession found it difficult to live and faced immense hardship. Everyone had to move out, but in December, the Japanese authorities stipulated that each person had to purchase a "Residence Permit" for three to five yuan in Japanese currency before returning to their original residence. Pedestrians must sincerely and respectfully bow 90 degrees to Japanese soldiers each time they encountered them on the road, otherwise they would be whipped. Even if their bowing was slightly unsatisfactory, they would not escape a beating. Once, a pedestrian with a shaved head passed in front of Japanese soldiers, who arbitrarily used their bayonets to mock and make fun of his head.</p>
<p>The People Continue to Resist: Hankou's Telegraph Bureau has now become the enemy's military police detective agency, which are everywhere. Every hotel, every alleyway is occupied by Japanese plainclothes detectives. Most hateful are those who are now working for the enemy as intelligence agents, including some who participated in the national salvation work in Wuhan in the past. They are constantly helping the enemy to spy, so that some of the comrades who remain in Wuhan are constantly being monitored by them. One slip and they will soon be arrested.</p>
<p>Our secret work in Wuhan is also being done quite well. Leaflets and slogans on the walls can often be found on the streets, such as "Reject the puppet organization, support Chairman Chiang to resist until the end." These slogans were found on the streets and walls on the morning of the day the puppet maintenance society was established. Although the Japanese authorities and their running dogs smeared them, they reappear immediately after it rains and are indelible traces. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Sexual Hygiene</p>
<h3 id="e36">A Vibrant and Happy Life is Based on the Health of Both Sexes <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>Modern couples exist in endless mutual dependence, and their mutual relationship is incomparable to the sexual lives of primitive people. The sexual lives of modern people are based entirely on mutual love and the control of etiquette. All brutality, jealousy, filth, terror, and obscenity, all improper actions arising from the material aspects of sexual desire, can be completely eliminated by the noble form of married life. A vibrant and happy life depends on the harmonious union of both sexes and their mutual improvement and promotion. If all the beautiful potential contained in the harmonious fusion of love life can be fully understood, then no one will want to escape into the asceticism of celibacy! It is a pity that the world still ignores this point, cannot fully exert the effect of the harmony of both sexes, and at the same time cannot strictly abide by the monogamous system for sexual health, resulting in damage and weakening, which affects love. It is really difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>Since the relationship between love and sexual health is as described above, then what methods can be used to make this function fully healthy and happy? In a word, one must cherish chastity before marriage and refrain from debauchery and self-gratification. It must be known that what distinguishes our sexual life from that of primitive people is entirely due to the advocacy of the concept of chastity. Without chastity, everyone can marry anyone, and debauchery and filth cannot be curbed. Therefore, those who are debauched before marriage are prone to causing diseases, and the brain nerves are also extremely weakened. Spinal nerves also show pathological changes. Thereafter, symptoms such as forgetfulness, insomnia, headache, dizziness, mental fatigue, kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, and back pain will also erupt.</p>
<p>In addition, early marriage and polygamy are also important reasons for the demise of people willing to sacrifice themselves for the country. Therefore, those who are good at hygiene must value their semen and not dare to indulge in sexual desire and cause damage. Every drop of semen and blood is an important raw material for the love between husband and wife. Therefore, those who have the above-mentioned problems should quickly start with increasing essence and nourishing blood, taking aphrodisiac pills containing endocrine agents. This is not only to supplement the weakness of essence and blood caused by indulgence in sexual desire but also to promote health. From this perspective, after administering the male "Butikon" orally, the function of the testicles to produce sperm cells becomes active, and new essence and blood can be produced continuously. No matter which patient it is, they can show amazing and outstanding effects within 24 hours of being treated with "Butikon," giving their wives unparalleled comfort. At this time, the wife's heartfelt joy is difficult to describe. There are many disharmonious couples in the world. Taking "Butikon" has the effect of regulating menstruation and producing seeds. From then on, a vibrant and happy life begins.</p>
<h3 id="e37">The Most Advanced Treatment for Lung Disease <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Why is lung disease difficult to treat? Because the tubercle bacillus is covered with wax, which is acid-resistant. Therefore, any oral medication cannot remove its wax, but only has the effect of improving nutrition, so its effectiveness is uncertain. Since Dr. Tume of Germany used the latest theory to formulate "Bofei Nar" from various mineral and plant ingredients, there has been considerable progress in the treatment of lung disease. The special effect of this agent is to enhance resistance to remove the armed state—wax—of tubercle bacillus. Therefore, the extremely violent tubercle bacillus has no place to stand and is completely eliminated. Therefore, no matter how difficult to treat lung disease is, taking "Bofei Nar" will completely cure it. It also has good effects on children's whooping cough, senile asthma, and all influenza, chronic cough, and excessive phlegm.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Treating Spermatorrhea Must Pay Attention to Hygiene <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Among the symptoms of neurasthenia, there is a condition called spermatorrhea, which affects a very large number of people, especially young people who have just entered adulthood. It is almost unavoidable. Those with severe symptoms often have spontaneous emissions, so that a slight stimulation can also cause semen to flow out. This is known as "sliding emission," which is a particularly serious situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of spermatorrhea, choosing effective drugs to consolidate the seminal gate is essential, but if one does not pay attention to hygiene or engages in self-gratification, taking large amounts of medicine will still be ineffective. Therefore, at this time, patients should cleanse their hearts and reduce desires, reject lustful thoughts, read noble books, engage in exercise, and abstain from smoking and alcohol. Special attention must be paid to urination before going to bed, because spermatorrhea is a symptom of neurasthenia, so the treatment of neurasthenia is absolutely necessary. Take the male "Butikon," an animal testicle sperm extract, three times a day, three tablets each time, and also take three "Nair Spermatorrhea Tablets" before going to bed. Not only can spermatorrhea be completely cured, but also the underdevelopment, premature aging, back pain, loss of appetite, and other symptoms caused by spermatorrhea can be cured one by one in a short period of time.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Chemical Therapy and the Evaluation of Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Chemical therapy has indeed made considerable contributions to the treatment of gonorrhea, but it is not absolutely effective. This is because such therapies can hardly encompass and cure the ever-changing nature of gonorrhea. For example, the chemical therapies currently popular on the market are suitable for acute gonorrhea in some cases and chronic gonorrhea in others. The quest for a comprehensive treatment has yet to be realized. This is because it is beyond the power of medicine to achieve. Regarding this reason, medical experts in Europe and the United States have already made thorough discussions, and there is no need for further elaboration.</p>
<p>What is now attracting the attention of the general public is non-specific therapy. The invention of this therapy has a distinctly superior point compared to general chemical therapy. That is, non-specific therapy can increase the function of white blood cells and bacteria, so it can surpass general chemical therapy as a fundamental treatment for gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter, a German master of venereology, is a giant in the field of gonorrhea studies. He has also conducted more than thirty years of research on the invention of gonorrhea drugs. Based on non-specific therapy, he conducted further research, and the results were greatly rewarding. The doctor used a special protein body mixed with yellow pigment to produce it. After animal experiments, it was clinically tested by famous doctors from various countries. After continuous improvement, the result was the invention of the special gonorrhea drug "Krellinnon," which is praised by experts from all over the world. Clinical practitioners in various countries have praised this agent extensively.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, I felt particularly troubled by gonorrhea before the invention of "Krellinnon." However, since the invention of "Krellinnon," I have found it much more convenient. All cases of chronic prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, arthritis, etc., that had not been cured by chemical therapy were completely cured after switching to "Krellinnon." In addition, using "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" to wash the urethra, and for women with gonorrhea and leucorrhea, "Cardell-Sheehy Vaginal Suppositories" can be used externally as suppositories. Patients can self-treat at home every day according to the diagram and instructions, and the effect is even better, with a high success rate. There is absolutely no case of failure.</p>

<p>The testicle is an important organ for producing sperm, and its importance to our survival is well known. However, the hateful gonorrhea often takes advantage of people's unpreparedness and attacks this important reproductive fortress, leading to the loss of life functions, which is truly terrible. Therefore, we must quickly treat gonorrheal orchitis without hesitation. Otherwise, the gonorrhea will become more and more severe, and it will spread uncontrollably. I have been in clinical practice for twenty years. If the patient's testicle has not become completely hardened, there is still a way to remedy it. The following case is clear evidence, and readers can pay attention to it!</p>
<p>Patient Li Shuchun, 24 years old, from Liyang, Jiangsu, a businessman. He contracted gonorrhea two years ago and once recovered by injuring himself. The following year, because his elderly mother was eager to have a grandson, she told him to return home to get married. Li was still single in Shanghai. After getting married, he enjoyed his honeymoon life. However, the old poison recurred, causing orchitis due to gonorrhea infection. The testicles were swollen and painful, and he walked awkwardly. Sitting felt like a heavy object was hanging down. After a long period of treatment, it was about to harden. Fortunately, through the introduction of Zhu Zhujun, he came to me for treatment. After I used scientific methods to examine him, I diagnosed him with gonorrheal epididymitis, and it seemed that there was a tendency for internal suppuration. Therefore, I urgently used the special gonorrhea drug "Krellinnon" to produce a special effect of anti-gonorrheal bacteria. On the other hand, I also used German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy, and ordered the patient to rest at home. This treatment took only five weeks before he was completely cured. Later, scientific methods of serum examination were used to prove that there was absolutely no gonorrheal reaction. From this day on, twenty numbers are sent to the clinic every day, and each number costs only five cents.</p>

<h3 id="e41">The Decline in Financial Spot Gold Remains Slight; Xiamen Gang Continues to Purchase, with Only a Five-Yuan Difference Throughout the Day <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold grey market continued to be flat and weak, but the range of fluctuations in the middle was still narrow, with only a five-yuan difference throughout the day. The situation showed a trend of first falling and then rising. Although a certain gold shop continued to purchase on behalf of the Xiamen Gang, the gold shops and money exchange businesses were both engaged in arbitrage selling, and the jewelry shops also came to sell. Therefore, the underlying trend once declined, reaching the 2,060-yuan mark. Subsequently, the buying interest of the Xiamen Gang revived, and the jewelry shops also switched from selling to buying, so the price turned upward, resulting in a final decline of only two yuan. All parties were observing with long-term considerations because they were aware of the uncertain situation in Europe, so they were all bearish, but there were no futures buyers. The volume of transactions was similar to the previous day, totaling five hundred and several tens of taels. Jewelry gold was listed at one yuan less. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Declined by Two Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels), sellers initially called for 2,065 yuan. However, at that time, most buyers were waiting and watching. Although many parties depreciated the price by three or four yuan, it was still difficult to find a counterpart, so there was no opening for a long time. Until 10:15 AM, a certain gold shop continued to absorb purchases on behalf of the Xiamen Gang, and then transactions were seen. First, a certain gold shop advanced 50 taels each to the cash gold shop and colleagues, all at a price of 2,063 yuan, which was the opening price, three yuan lower than the previous closing price. After the opening, the same price was used, and the jewelry shops also mutually traded 50 taels. Soon, the money exchange business provided 20 taels to the jewelry shops, at a price of 61 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop came to purchase and absorb 50 taels from colleagues and 50 taels from the money exchange business, all at a price of 63 yuan. After that, the absorbing power of the certain gold shop weakened, so the trend continued to decline. At 11:20 AM, the jewelry shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange business, at a price of 60 yuan. Afterwards, those who entered still had a liking for the above price, but the sellers held back. By noon, no transactions were seen, so the noon closing price was still 60 yuan. In the afternoon, the underlying trend turned better, because the Xiamen Gang continued to absorb purchases in secret. First, the jewelry shops advanced 50 taels to the advance exchange business, at a price of 62 yuan. A certain gold shop advanced 50 taels to the money exchange business, at a price of 60 yuan. Then, they advanced 30 taels to the money exchange business, at a price of 65 yuan. Finally, at 4:10 PM, the cash gold shop advanced 50 taels to the money exchange business, at a price of 2,064 yuan, which was the late closing price. As a result, the closing price was two yuan lower than the previous evening's closing price. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand of gold was 2,070 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,060 yuan. The current standard gold was listed at 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed at One Yuan Less</p>
<p>The initial price of jewelry gold per tael was unchanged. By noon, because the spot gold noon closing price had fallen to the 60-yuan mark, it was also listed at one yuan less. Da Tong Hang changed to list at 209 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang listed at 207 yuan, purchasing at 201 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>London telegram on the 11th: The price of British pure gold per ounce remained unchanged at seven pounds, eight shillings, and six pence. As a result, the Bank of China's purchase price of Chinese cash also remained at 1,212 yuan and 30 cents. The listed customs gold remained unchanged, calculated at 2 yuan, 30 cents, 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged, calculated at 1,207 yuan and 60 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, although foreign firms continued to purchase in the foreign exchange market, the supply from non-specialized firms such as HSBC remained unabated. Therefore, the supply and demand corresponded, resulting in an extremely stable situation. As a result, there were no gains or losses. The volume of transactions in the morning was also quite sparse. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, because the money exchange businesses were selling quite vigorously, the situation continued to trend towards relaxation.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London big bars were flat in both near and far terms. The New York silver price remained stable. London raw gold also showed no increase or decrease. The exchange rates for British currency against American currency and against Shanghai currency remained flat. Against French currency, it fell by three cents.

The central listing of various exchange rates remained as before. The morning opening selling price of banks was 8 pence and 25 for British currency and 16 yuan and 0.0625 for American currency, which was the same as the previous evening's closing price. After the opening, although foreign firms came to purchase, non-specialized firms were quite willing to supply, so the situation was uneventful. Foreign firms settled with HSBC, and the HSBC listing remained unchanged. The announcement of the white silver balance tax also showed no increase or decrease, still levying 5.00 percent. After that, foreign firms continued to purchase for settlement. A certain bank purchased American currency at 16 yuan and 0.0625. Then, a certain bank crossed and sold American dollar bills to Da Tong at 16 yuan and 0.1875. Therefore, the process remained largely unchanged. Near noon, the money exchange businesses frequently stuffed Hong Kong currency, selling Hong Kong currency to foreign firms, Dutch Anda, and a certain bank, from 56 yuan to 56 yuan and 0.125, causing the market price to be slightly cheaper. By noon, the bank selling price was 8 pence and 25 for British currency and 16 yuan and 0.0625 for American currency, which was the same as the morning opening price. As a result, there was no increase or decrease compared to the previous closing price, while the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to rise by 1.25. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday.</p>

Retail absorption was sluggish, and the momentum was very weak. In the afternoon, money exchange businesses, retailers, etc., slightly absorbed, and the declining trend was slightly improved. Transactions were rare, and fluctuations were very narrow. The result was slightly soft, because the European situation was tense, people were panicked, and the intention of buyers was waning, resulting in a stalemate. Wealthy people were very eager to release foreign currency British and American gold pounds, and many were also selling British and American dollar bills to avoid wasting interest. Banks and money exchange businesses did not have strong demand, and prices slightly declined. Hong Kong currency showed signs of relaxation. Japanese fresh dollar bills continued to trend weakly.

<h3 id="e47">Securities: Foreign Debt Prices Fluctuate; Domestic Debt Prices Mainly Rise <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>In the securities grey market, yesterday's market situation can be described as firm and stable. The rise was very slight and not strong. Generally, there were many speculative trading activities, but there were relatively few buyers, resulting in a temporary stability and stability of market prices. The large bullish forces never let go because the environment was still brewing. Once there was definite news of peace, the exchange would inevitably open, and the market price would inevitably rise again. Yesterday's situation: At the opening, Category A was purchased by Yongkang, Category B was absorbed by No. 4, and other categories were purchased by Da Feng and No. 22. Those who sold Category B and bought Category D, hoping to win the lottery, were Tiansheng No. 35 and Tongkang Songmao. There were also sellers. In the afternoon, transactions were very clear. Both buyers and sellers were not very enthusiastic. In general, the bullish forces still dominated, and the result continued to be good, rising from 5 cents, 10 cents to 35 cents. The total number of transactions was more than 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debt Listed Market Prices on the 11th of this month (Tuesday): The prices of various debts fluctuated. The Feakes Airplane Debt Note rose by 1 pound, with the price being 17 pounds. The original and continued issued debts of the Jinpu Railway each rose by half a pound, with the price being 17 pounds and a half. The British-German continued loan British issued debt note and the Sino-French American dollar 5% public bond with printed debt notes each fell by half a pound. The former's price was 68 pounds, and the latter's price was 64 pounds and a half. Also, the 6th market price of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway public bond rebounded by 5 shillings, which was a misprint in the original report and should be corrected. The remaining varieties remained unchanged. The supply of actual goods in London: British Gold Rehabilitation Public Bonds British issued debt notes of 2,000 pounds were sold at a price of 51 pounds and 15 shillings, 5 shillings higher than the market price. Also, German issued printed debt notes of 3,000 pounds were sold at a price of 47 yuan and 15 cents, 3 pounds and 15 shillings lower than the British issued price. Jinpu Railway continued issued public bonds British issued debt notes of 2,000 pounds were sold at a price of 18 pounds and 5 shillings, 15 shillings higher than the market price.</p>
<p>Stock Market: London British-owned Far East company stocks listed market prices on the 11th of this month (Tuesday) continued to decline. The Jardine Matheson Bank stock fell back by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with the price being 8 pounds. The HSBC Bank stock each fell by half a pound. The British registered stock fell to 82 pounds and a half. The Hong Kong registered stock fell to 84 pounds and a half. The Kailuan Mining Bureau stock fell back by 6 pence, with the price being 17 shillings and 6 pence. The Kula Klang Rubber stock fell by 7 pence and a half, with the price being 16 shillings and 10 pence and a half. Also, the 6th report Shanghai Waterworks A share fell by 5 shillings, which was a misprint in the original report and should be corrected. The remaining varieties remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Shanghai Public Trade Association reported that the stock market situation was flat, and prices were slightly lower. Holders withdrew and watched, and there were also fewer new buyers, because it was clear that the subsequent international situation was still unstable. The Jardine Matheson stock did not change much, hovering between the 20 yuan price. The Yesson Dock stock was traded at a price of 100 yuan. Rubber raw material prices fell slightly. It was expected that the US government intends to exchange cotton and wheat for rubber and tin in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Rubber users should therefore stop purchasing. There was also intense propaganda in all parties that the production of rubber should be increased. If this is the case, the raw material market should have a bad atmosphere. However, this statement cannot be confirmed now. If this is implemented, it is expected that the rubber stocks in this city will not be affected, because even though the price may be reduced slightly due to the increase in production, the profits from the increased production of raw materials by various companies will be more. Last week, the British rubber inventory decreased by more than 1,300 tons.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Securities Market traded 50 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Stock, with the price being 6 yuan and 40 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Yarn and Cotton: Inventory is Thin; Ten-Count Coarse Yarn Prices Rise Uniquely; Shenxin Factory Continues to Open Two Thousand Bales of "Celestial Girl" Yarn <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a stable situation, but the price of 20-count yarn is increasing because the factory's production has increased and the inventory is relatively strong. The demand in various places in South China, such as Yunnan, Hong Kong, Chaozhou, and Shantou, has improved day by day, and the volume is huge. The market price should rise, but there are many holders of goods who do not have the concept of raising prices and follow the trend, so the upward trend of the market is advancing in a roundabout way. However, the raw materials for 10-count coarse yarn are lacking, and the output of various factories has decreased. The inventory is thin, and the factories generally have no inventory. The selling price has escaped the difficulties of fine yarn and is moving forward. The prices of 32-count single yarn and 42-count double-strand thread are also in a quiet situation as the spot goods are lacking. Observing the overall trend of the yarn market, it will not escape the state of hesitation for the time being. In the afternoon, Hong Kong gang transactions were still healthy, and they rebounded again.</p>
<p>Situation of current yarn: At the opening of the morning, the market felt more lively, and the atmosphere was still tight, because the customer sales were good, so the selling prices of various goods were called a step higher. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse and "Celestial Girl" yarn increased by one yuan. The price of 42-count Qian yarn continued to rise due to strong demand. The Tianjin gang had a healthy appetite for 10-count coarse yarn, and the Yunnan gang followed suit, and the factory's quota was almost completely searched. By the closing, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell back because the base was loose and everyone was vying to sell at a high price. The closing price of Double Horse was 390 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the market was on the rise due to the lack of real needs. The current price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by two yuan, at 392 yuan. As a result, the statistics of various departments buying went to 1,563 bales for the whole day, and 240 bales were traded in the afternoon of the previous day, totaling 1,803 bales. The market price of 20-count "Celestial Girl" and Double Horse was about the same as the price of the previous day, but the price of 10-count coarse yarn alone rose by 3-4 yuan. 32-count and 42-count were flat. The Shenxin No. 2 Factory opened 20 bales of 20-count "Celestial Girl" yarn, with the price being 389 yuan, for the period from April to September. The Yong'an Factory opened 160 bales of 20-count Special Golden City yarn, with the price being 400 yuan. The Xinyu Factory opened 100 bales of 10-count Double Globe yarn, with the price being 308 yuan, and 50 bales of 16-count Double Globe yarn, with the price being 370-371 yuan. Today, 750 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, and 180 pieces were shipped to Yantai. The amounts bought by each gang are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Same Trade 660 Yunnan 120</p>
<p>Hong Kong 513 Mainland 90</p>
<p>Tianjin 290 Shantou 30</p>
<p>Northern Gang 100 Total 1,803</p>
<p>Japanese yarn market: Due to the stagnation of real demand, there were often days with markets but no sales. However, the trading of wins and losses in the next month was extremely lively. Imports were frequent, and market prices fluctuated from time to time. As a result, the current price of 20-count Water Moon yarn was 359-360 yuan, and the current price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 356 yuan, up 2-3 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Local Cotton is Virtually Stagnant; Manufacturers Switch to Purchasing American and Indian Cotton <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The local cotton business is as flat as if it were stagnant. This is because the sources from all routes are interrupted. Zhejiang cotton is affected by the river closure and is difficult to transport out. It relies solely on the Subei route, which has a small amount of goods arriving, but the amount is decreasing day by day. As for the factories, although they have the intention of starting to handle it, there are also no goods to smoothly enter. Therefore, it has become a desolate scene. Some manufacturers have shifted their target to foreign cotton. However, the quality of Indian cotton is poor, and the factories are extremely reluctant to purchase it. However, under this environment, it is not enough to remedy the situation without adopting foreign cotton. Therefore, many are starting to handle American cotton. Only 480 bales of Tongzhou cotton have arrived at the pier. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market still shows no improvement. Washington has not yet released any documents on cotton industry issues. Yesterday, it was rumored that the US government planned to use a loan of 5 million bales of cotton to exchange for 600,000 tons of rubber, but this statement could not be confirmed. If it can be implemented, cotton prices may have a chance to turn around. Yesterday, New York fell by 1-4 pounds. India, including forecasts, fell by half a rupee. Egypt was flat. Yesterday, the exchange rate did not change compared to the previous one. Converted into legal tender, the cotton prices are estimated to have fallen by 20 cents per dan for American cotton and Brazilian cotton, fallen by 20 cents for Indian cotton, and risen slightly by 40 cents for Egyptian cotton.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading: Yarn prices have been more active in recent days, so the cotton market has shown a slight turnaround. Therefore, there have been sporadic transactions in recent days, but large-scale orders are still pending. In the past few days, due to the brisk sales of coarse yarn, most of the raw cotton purchased by various factories has been short-fiber cotton. Yesterday, Shenxin advanced 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, Hefeng advanced 500 bales of American cotton, and Anda advanced 200 bales of Indian cotton. The cotton market prices yesterday, converted to factory delivery prices, are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e50">Soybean Cake: Soybean Oil Still Sold Secretly; Market Prices Slightly Rebound, Then Decline <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean oil rose sharply and then declined slightly. The source of Lian Oil has not completely disappeared. It seems that Xintai, a Japanese company in the past, secretly sold it, and there is also a saying that foreign firms such as Lulin Foreign Firm also sold it. The next period in March can also be settled, leading to a decline in confidence. However, the appetites of various routes are concentrated in Shanghai, so there is a general situation of a drop in the bucket. Yesterday, a total of more than 400 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were traded, with the price opening at 42 yuan and 50 cents. As a result, the closing price was 41 yuan, 35 cents. Lianqi large baskets opened 150 pieces, with the price being 39 yuan. Peanut oil was unchanged. Only 120 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, with the price also opening at 34 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e51">North and South Goods: White Lotus is High; Sugar is Transported from Shantou and Hong Kong <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Due to traffic difficulties, the source of Lanxi White Lotus is extremely lacking, and the price has risen frequently. Recently, both the Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs have appetites for sales, and the market price has risen again. Yesterday, it was sold to 120 yuan in cash, which is about to rise by more than 10 yuan before and after.</p>
<p>On the 12th, 300 bags of sugar were imported from Hong Kong, another 540 bags from Shantou, another 190 bags from Beihai, and another 117 bags of cold sugar from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Food: Foreign Flour is Being Dumped; Factory Flour Prices Rebound by 5 Cents; Wheat Arriving Earlier Has Been Exhausted; City Inventory Feels Lacking <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Factory flour: The factory prices of current flour have been loosened in the past few days. The customer sales in the north and south have been pretty good in recent days, but the appetites for sales are quite emphasized. After a large batch of foreign flour arrived on the market recently, the Northern Ocean Gang has transported away a lot, and the factory flour has been affected. Therefore, starting yesterday, the factory has lowered the factory prices by 2.5-5 cents for the sake of competition. Both the north and south gangs have new transactions, but the wholesale prices in this street have not changed, still holding at 4 yuan and 40 cents. A total of more than 40,000 bags were traded in the city, and the market environment was generally flat.</p>
<p>Foreign flour: Yesterday's market situation was still stable. Recently, due to reports of price increases in overseas telegrams, there were few long-term fixed flour transactions. The floating inventory of current foreign flour on the market has been reduced after being favored by Japanese customers for several days, so the sellers are very reluctant to change. However, the market has also seen little special development amid the low prices of factory flour. It is said that brands such as the Bat, Double Eagle, and Lamp Model are still sold at 4 yuan and 30 cents, while the Sailing Boat brand must be added by 5 cents, and the old brand Red Sun must be 4 yuan and 30 cents in cash. More than 20,000 bags were also traded.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's transactions trended back to quiet. The new Jiangnan and Jiangbei wheat that arrived in the past two days has been searched and handled by North China, resulting in a lack of city inventory again. At present, the raw materials for various flour mills, in addition to foreign wheat orders arriving one after another, are also being handled by local wheat from the producing areas. Therefore, they rarely pay attention to the city goods, and the customer gangs have also stopped watching one after another due to the lack of goods to handle. Even the few sporadic arrivals have been secretly absorbed by the Japanese flour mills, so the market transactions have virtually stopped again.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Shippers are Willing to Sell; Prices of Thick and Thin Japonica Rice are Slightly Soft <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of three called numbers arrived from various gangs in the river, and a total of more than 2,000 bags from CheLunBaoZi and Suzhou, Tongkun, and Kunshan gangs. Arrivals are rare, and the sellers' thoughts have become firm. However, in terms of the sales market, this street is weak, and the hoarders are also sluggish, so the market is settled. However, there are also shippers who are willing to sell, so the prices of thick and thin Japonica rice have all shown a slightly soft body. Du Yangjian, Bu Jian, and Bian Yuan still hold firm to the original prices due to similar supply and demand.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Customer Xian Rice Sales are Weak, Reversing the Corner Angle <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for customer Xian rice still lacked wholesale transactions from customer gangs and trading hoards. The appetite for sales on this street was weak, and the price of the river Bu Jian reported small. The sources of Wu Xian rice were continuous, and new arrivals were piled up at the Hongkou depots. Subsequent batches were still arriving at the port, so importers wanted to watch and wait before handling again. Yesterday's market only opened more than 1,000 bags, and the market price reversed the corner by a few cents. High Wu Xian rice only opened at 13 yuan and 25 cents. However, the supply of Saigon rice was dry, and the shippers insisted on not letting it go lightly. Yesterday, the original package wholesale price increased by 5 cents, with the price opening at 17 yuan and 25 cents. High Saigon rice was called to 17 yuan, 50-60 cents.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Thriving Raw Silk Sales by American and French Firms – Indian and African Silk Markets Stir After Prolonged Stagnation <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Overseas silk markets generally remained firm yesterday, although some slight price declines were reported for certain forward contracts, but this was not considered significant. In New York, the May contract fell two cents, while raw silk opened at its original price. Japanese silk spot prices rose five to seven cents. In Yokohama, spot prices for raw silk in the morning market were at a small five yuan, while forward prices were at a small eleven yuan. In Lyon, Chinese silk opened at its original price, while Japanese silk rose two francs. Considering the fluctuations in overseas silk prices, spot goods remain in an advantageous position. Given the strong sales seen solely by Japanese firms in American and French ports, the future of silk prices seems to be brewing. Moreover, silk markets in various regions have shown firmness and stability for over a week. Subsequently, silk prices may rise again.</p>
<p>In the local silk market, due to the stability of both domestic and overseas silk prices, and after suffering from the manipulation of speculators for months, foreign silk sales have become active amidst this stable and firm silk market. Yesterday, silk transactions continued to be active. Transactions of high-grade white filature silk from French firms and 7/8 filature 20-34 from American firms for April contracts were made, with Xinfu, Dachang, and other firms engaging in hundreds of bales of trade. According to market records, besides the firm prices of fine French filature silk from firms like Chongyu, American firms' evenness silk even rose slightly by ten yuan compared to the previous day. However, the sentiment in the silk market has clearly shifted from bearish to bullish. Transactions of Jing silk from Zhejiang remained sluggish, with a price difference of thirty yuan compared to domestic and overseas prices. The Indian and African silk markets, having been quiet for a long time, seemed to be stirring after seeing active sales from British and French firms recently. However, due to the significant price difference between domestic and overseas markets, no deals were made for the time being.</p>
<p>Nine pieces of yellow silk arrived from Hong Kong, along with 977 packages of tea.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Piece Goods <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<h3 id="e58">Fine Yarn Prices Soar Daily – Dyeing Factories Pre-Order Autumn Goods – Huge Volume Transactions in Coarse Cloth for June, July, August – Price of White Goods and Fine Twill Up by Ten to Twenty Cents per Bolt <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The market continues to be good, mainly because the raw materials for fine yarn are rising daily, and dyeing factories are working hard to pre-order autumn goods from various factories. Orders for various gray fabrics are being placed much earlier than in previous years. Current sales of seasonal goods such as Tiao Zifu silk, bleached cloth, foreign yarn, striped bleached cloth, and printed piece goods are still good, and market prices are gradually rising. Therefore, even during the summer off-season, factories still need to speed up deliveries, resulting in very stable sentiment. There have been substantial transactions in both coarse and fine gray fabrics for June, July, and August, causing the factory prices to continue to rise. The price of white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill has increased by ten to twenty cents per bolt, with over 800 pieces being offered. Resale of goods by fellow merchants has also followed this upward trend. Coarse cloth from Ewo, which has not increased in price, is gradually becoming cheaper than the products of Lu factories, attracting customer purchases. Wholesale shops on this street purchased over 300 bales. Customers from Guangdong are showing strong demand, with transactions mostly consisting of dyed fine twill, totaling over 2,000 bolts. Merchants from Fujian are purchasing bleached cloth, Fuchou silk, colored cloth, and colored twill, totaling over 200 pieces. Due to the scarcity of ships from Sichuan and Yunnan, leading to congested cargo conditions, purchasing appetite has decreased.</p>
<p>East Cloth: In the morning market, sales of fine cloth and fine twill appeared weak, with both local and actual sales being sluggish. Market sentiment is hesitant. The price of various types of fine cloth has fallen sharply, with 12-pound Longtou hitting a low of 12.65 yuan. Subsequently, because Ewo purchased over 200 bales, settling prices at 12.70 to 12.75 yuan, although there were no major transactions from customers, there were still 500 to 600 pieces on this street, so the market turned tight. Longtou fine cloth was at 12.80 yuan, and Longtou fine twill was at 12.60 yuan, down about five cents per bolt compared to the previous morning market. Observing the situation, the market is tired yet stable.</p>
<p>Today, 310 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin, and another 330 pieces were exported to Yantai.</p>

<p>Recently, the demand for Caokou nuts from merchants in the Yangtze River area has been very strong, leading to active trade.

Furthermore, due to limited inventory, supplies of Renhao brand goods will soon be completely sold out.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Zhejiang Province Implements Water and Land Transportation Controls – Strengthens Coastal Defenses – Heavy Troops Stationed with Fortifications and Strict Alertness – Japanese Planes Conduct Reconnaissance and Bombing, Japanese Warships Sighted off Zhejiang Coast <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>To strengthen coastal defenses, Zhejiang Province has prohibited navigation in Haimen and Ningbo and promulgated an outline of measures for controlling water and land transportation. Heavy troops are stationed in various locations, with strict alert levels. Japanese aircraft have been sighted over Zhejiang East, and Japanese warships have been sighted off the coast of Zhejiang. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strengthening Defenses and Promulgating Guidelines</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government has promulgated an outline of measures for controlling water and land transportation in wartime, aiming to strengthen coastal defenses and enhance transportation efficiency to facilitate the smooth sale of local products and promote new economic development. The management of water and land transportation tools within the province, whether government-owned, privately-owned, powered, or manual, will be managed according to the regulations of this outline, under the direction of the Transportation Department. At the same time, important military areas have fortifications built, with heavy troops stationed and strict alert levels maintained.</p>
<p>Wenzhou as the Only Open Port</p>
<p>All coastal ports in Zhejiang East, except for Ningbo, Haimen, and Wenzhou, have been successively closed to navigation. Docks such as Longshan have also been demolished. The Jiaojiang River in Haimen has now been completely blocked, and Zhenhai in Ningbo has strictly prohibited ships from entering or leaving. Therefore, Wenzhou is currently the only port in Zhejiang East temporarily allowed for navigation. The Oujiang River in Wenzhou has a blockade line built at Qingshi, but there is a gap left in the blockade line to allow ships to enter and exit. Ships entering and exiting must first anchor at Jiangxin for inspection before being allowed to dock.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Fly over Zhejiang for Reconnaissance and Bombing</p>
<p>In the morning, a Japanese plane intruded into the airspace over Yueqing City, scattering absurd leaflets. At the same time, a Japanese plane was sighted in Ruian, also scattering leaflets. On the eighth, several Japanese planes bombed Jiangshan and Qu County, with the targets being the airfield and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway station. However, the bombs all fell on wasteland, causing no local damage. It is reported that Yushan in Jiangxi was also bombed, with bombs falling into the city, destroying many houses and injuring civilians.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Patrol the Waters off Zhejiang East</p>
<p>Several Japanese warships are anchored in Hangzhou Bay, seemingly with some intent towards Zhejiang East. On the seventh, a single-funnel Japanese warship was sighted off the coast of Yueqing, passing through Shandamen and heading west. However, there are no traces of Japanese warships outside the Oujiang River estuary in Wenzhou, the Jiaojiang River estuary in Haimen, and the Zhenhai estuary in Ningbo. However, Japanese warships are frequently sighted patrolling off the coast of Zhejiang.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Issues Statement of Purpose <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Production Association has now selected 350 Yunnan Road as its headquarters and is actively preparing for its establishment. It has also issued a statement of purpose, which states: "Since the outbreak of the war, our compatriots in the interior have lamented the devastation of their homes and the desolation of their fields. Uprooted and displaced, they have gathered in Shanghai. Various charitable organizations in the city have exerted their utmost efforts to comfort the displaced and provide them with clothing and food. However, the war has dragged on indefinitely, and long-term relief is not only practically difficult but also ultimately insufficient in terms of resources and energy. Moreover, it places a burden on society, reduces economic benefits, buries the labor force of the nation, and easily breeds dependency. To wait for the end of the war and the repatriation of refugees is impractical. The war zone is in ruins, and only those who own small plots of land can return to farming. What will become of those who have lost their homes and jobs? After much deliberation, we believe that it is better to provide long-term support actively than to offer temporary relief passively. Requiring no large amount of capital, it can accommodate a large number of refugees in production. Requiring no sophisticated skills, it only needs common sense and labor. Nothing is better than setting up workshops and relocating them to cultivate land. There is an extremely large number of refugees in Shanghai, and it is imperative to find a solution to this problem. The best way to solve this problem is to set up simple workshops and relocate them to engage in agriculture. We hope that compatriots at home and abroad will work together to achieve this, benefiting both the national economy and the people's livelihoods."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Kerosene Industry Association, since last year, has seen its members scattered, with only fifteen remaining. The scope of business has also shrunk by sixty to seventy percent, and the Nanshi headquarters was destroyed by artillery fire. However, it continues to actively support public welfare undertakings. It recently held a meeting and decided to implement a business commission starting from April this year, donating 2.5% per case of kerosene. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the industry group for record.</p>

<p>The Citizens' Group Fundraising Committee believes that most of the refugees in the city's shelters are elderly, weak, women, and children, and they will need long-term support before the end of the war.

<h3 id="e68">Portuguese Ship Data Detained Again – Portuguese Consul Lodges Protest Yesterday – Report Submitted to Minister, Preparing to Telegraph Japan for Negotiation – Portuguese Merchants Decide to Suspend Sailing Temporarily <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>After Japanese warships detained Portuguese merchant ships off the coast of Zhejiang and forced them back to Shanghai, the passengers of each ship have been completely released, but the goods are not allowed to be unloaded. The Portuguese ship Data, represented by Jardine Matheson, was detained again the day before yesterday. The Portuguese Consul General formally submitted a written protest yesterday and reported it to the Minister, preparing to telegraph the Minister to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Monitoring Ships and Preventing Unloading</p>
<p>The eight ships, including Tangbei, Tangqiao, Tanglu, Mida, Hailong, Libao, Rude, and Baode, were allowed by Japanese warships to sail into Wusong Port one after another and are now docked at Yangshupu Piers 16, 17, and 18. Although the passengers have been completely released, the ships are still under surveillance by Japanese warships. Japanese soldiers are stationed on each ship, prohibiting the ships' radio stations from sending telegrams, preventing the ships' radio stations from communicating with the company. As for the ship crew, from the captain to the sailors, they all remain on board, and the goods loaded on board are not allowed to be unloaded.</p>
<p>Portuguese Ship Data Detained Again</p>
<p>The Portuguese ship Data, represented by Jardine Matheson, runs the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, mainly carrying cargo. After arriving in Shanghai from Wenzhou, it docked at the Longmao Pier in Pudong to unload cargo. The day before yesterday, after the cargo was unloaded, it was preparing to sail to Pier 31 in Yangshupu to dock when it was detained by Japanese warships. It is now also docked at Pier 17, guarded and monitored by Japanese soldiers. However, since it is an empty ship, there are no goods. The crew members are all staying on board. However, according to Jardine Matheson, the ship belongs to the Portuguese Far East Company, but the Far East Company does not recognize it.</p>
<p>Portuguese Consul Lodges Written Protest Yesterday</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Portuguese Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday that the Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, Alves, had visited the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, and the Japanese naval authorities to inquire about the detention of Portuguese merchant ships. After verifying the facts, based on the reports of various national shipping merchants, he formally submitted a written protest to the Japanese Consul in Shanghai, Miura, at 10:00 am yesterday. It is said that the content of the protest letter was very firm, demanding the immediate release of the merchant ships and guaranteeing that similar incidents would not occur again.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Minister and Telegraphing Japan for Negotiation</p>
<p>According to shipping sources, after the detained Portuguese ships were forced to fly the Japanese flag, the Portuguese flags of each ship were taken down. At that time, negotiations with the Portuguese shipowners were ineffective. Because the removal of the national flag concerns government sovereignty, the Portuguese merchants are very angry and have reported to the Portuguese Consul General to protest to Japan. It is also heard that the Portuguese Consul General has reported to the Portuguese Minister to China, preparing to telegraph the Portuguese Minister to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government. At the same time, all the ships of the Portuguese merchant ship companies, after consultation, have decided to suspend sailing temporarily.</p>
<p>Portuguese Merchants Suspend Sailing</p>
<p>After the Portuguese merchant ships decided to suspend sailing, (1) the Portuguese ships docked in Shanghai are: Merrill's ship Meifa, Zhengde's ship Shantaii, Huamei's ship Tangsai, Wanguo's ship Xinde, and Far East's ship Fade. (2) The Portuguese ships docked in Wenzhou are: Wanguo's ship Minhe and Far East's ship Damao. Before the detention of the Portuguese ships is resolved, they will all temporarily suspend sailing. Therefore, there are currently no Portuguese ships sailing along the coast.</p>
<p>Italian and German Merchant Ships Uniquely Sail to Wenzhou</p>
<p>After the Portuguese merchant ships suspended sailing, the Shanghai-Wenzhou route is uniquely sailed by German and Italian ships. (1) Yihua Foreign Firm's Shili and Lulin Foreign Firm's Feikang, both Italian and German ships, completed customs clearance yesterday and will sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou today. (2) Zhongyi Company's Deping and Lihe Foreign Firm's Haifu, both Italian and German ships, are scheduled to complete customs clearance tomorrow and sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou the day after tomorrow. (3) Although British ships from Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have been approved to sail the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, there have been no ships sailing recently.</p>
<p>Negotiating for the Return of Mail on Each Ship</p>
<p>The detained Portuguese ships, such as Merrill's ship Mida and Atlantic's ship Hailong, are loaded with mailbags sent from Shanghai to Wenzhou or from Wenzhou to Shanghai. The Shanghai Postal Administration has negotiated with the Japanese side for the return of these mailbags. The Japanese side has agreed to the request and allowed the return. As for the current mail and packages from Shanghai to Wenzhou, they are carried by Baolide and other ships.</p>

<p>Since Wang Jingwei colluded with Konoe, established a secret agreement, and sang the tune of peace, practically betraying the party and the country, he has been unanimously rejected by the people of the country, and telegrams have been sent to the central government, requesting his arrest to uphold the law. It is said that Wang's wild ambitions have not been curbed and he is still plotting activities. Recently, it was widely rumored in the city that he had arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and was hiding somewhere in Hongkou. However, a reporter from Modern News Agency inquired with relevant parties, and as of yesterday, it was still impossible to confirm this rumor. Well-informed sources firmly believe that Wang has left Hanoi, which is a fact, but it is still difficult to determine whether he is in Hong Kong or Guangzhou. According to other sources, Zhou Fohai and other members of Wang's gang have indeed arrived in Shanghai and have been very active in recent days. They are also planning to publish a reactionary newspaper in the city similar to the "Xin Shen Bao," with the office located on Baker Road, reportedly named the "Far East Daily," which will be used to numb the people's minds. However, the people of the country are united in their hatred of the enemy and will never be seduced by it.</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that there are now 6,500 German Jewish refugees in Shanghai, and providing them with food and lodging costs about 350,000 yuan per month, or more than 10,000 yuan per day. The figure of 6,500 is still a vague estimate. The number of refugees registered with the committee handling refugee affairs has exceeded 6,000, but the exact number of those who are self-sufficient and have not registered is unknown. It is said that there are as many as 8,000 people in total. It is estimated that the world can absorb 3,000 refugees per month, but it is expected that more than 3,000 Jewish refugees will arrive in Shanghai alone next month. Therefore, by the end of next month, there will be 10,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai. The committee needs to raise 1 million yuan per month to maintain operations. Of course, Shanghai is unable to raise this amount of money and can only donate a portion of it. The committee is currently struggling to find the funds needed to care for the 7,000 refugees it is currently looking after.</p>
<p>Quite Uncertain. If 1 million yuan is needed per month, it will be impossible to bear this heavy burden. After the 3,000 refugees arriving on a special ship next month, there are still regular liner ships scheduled to sail to Shanghai, with one ship every two weeks, carrying an average of 300 to 500 refugees per ship. The Conte Biancamano, which arrives in Shanghai on April 25, will carry 600 men, women, and children. All the committee members are working overtime, and some members believe that unless foreign governments donate funds, it will be</p>
<p>Difficult to Continue. Some members are more optimistic and are currently trying to consult with the League of Nations. Most of the refugees in Shanghai are living in shelters, and many are crossing the Suzhou Creek to the south bank to seek employment. In general, the seriousness of the situation of Jewish refugees in Shanghai is underestimated due to the calm attitude of the committee. In fact, the committee is having difficulty coping, which is its intention, because there are no deposits left, the situation is deteriorating daily, and thousands of men, women, and children are in danger of starvation.</p>

<p>In order to regulate rice prices and stabilize the livelihoods of the poor in Shanghai, the Rice Evaluation Committee conducted a survey of rice reserves within the two settlements. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with the committee yesterday and was informed of the results of the second survey. A total of 638,547 bags of rice were stored in 97 rice stores, with each bag calculated as either 1.2 or 1.5 piculs, totaling over 900,000 piculs. This is an increase of 37,203 bags compared to the first survey. The China Bank warehouse still had the largest amount, with 113,481 bags, followed by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank warehouse, with 103,009 bags in both the east and west warehouses. The committee has prepared a report and distributed it to relevant rice industry groups and the authorities of the two settlements for reference. The third survey will begin immediately and is scheduled to end around the 20th of this month. Regarding the selling prices of various rice stores, as the Qingming Festival has passed, rice merchants from various regions have resumed normal transportation, and the supply is increasing. The selling prices will fall again. Therefore, the selling prices of rice in the city have stabilized.</p>

<p>Japanese merchants are attempting to monopolize the fresh pork industry. The Continental Products Company is forcibly transporting fresh pigs from Xingang to Shanghai and collecting a pig tax of two yuan per head. Pork merchants have jointly resolved to firmly oppose this, hoping that Japanese merchants will stop the monopoly and abolish the exorbitant tax. It is reported that a declaration will be issued. Furthermore, the English ship Crystal, represented by Yuanlong Company, which was loading fresh pigs in Xingang, was obstructed by Japanese merchants from loading pigs. Therefore, it has been decided to suspend sailing temporarily.</p>

<p>The Malayan authorities have stipulated that the number of Chinese laborers entering the country is limited to 2,000 per month. Shipping companies operating in that region will allocate passenger tickets to various ports. Before the fall of Haikou, 150 tickets to Malaya were allocated daily. Since the fall of Haikou, people from Qiongyai have been unable to travel abroad by ship from that port. Shipping companies have also transferred the tickets allocated to Haikou to other ports for sale. The Qiongyai Overseas Chinese Federation, recognizing that the number of Qiongyai compatriots seeking a living in Nanyang after the war is increasing daily, has specially negotiated with British Taikoo Company and others to have the tickets originally allocated to Haikou given to the Qiongyai people by the federation. The federation has now notified all fellow villagers that those who wish to go abroad from Hong Kong can register with the federation first, and the federation will handle the purchase of tickets for them in order of registration.</p>

<p>The English-language North China Daily News reports that, according to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi, the Japanese naval authorities responsible for the recovery of the area north of the Suzhou Creek have recently warned the Japanese that anyone who uses the shortage of housing in the area to make improper profits from real estate will be expelled. The Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces Rehabilitation Department has obtained confirmation and will implement these harsh corrective measures. Houses owned by Chinese in the Hongkou and Kunlien areas are now rented out by the Japanese Residents Association on behalf of the homeowners, and the rent is transferred to the homeowners to prevent abuses. Some Japanese, taking advantage of the shortage of housing in the area, rent more houses from the association than they need and sublet them to others. The rent charged is sometimes three times higher than the rent paid to the Residents Association. Others rent houses, renovate them, and demand "excessive prices" for subletting the rooms to others. Some Japanese families live off the income from subletting houses in this way.</p>

<p>Since being placed under control, the various Shanghai Chinese merchant soybean oil companies have suffered considerable losses due to various restrictions, and the future of their business is even more bleak. However, unscrupulous merchants who only seek profit and disregard the law are taking the opportunity to hoard goods, causing market prices to rise. In the past two months, oil prices have soared without end. At the beginning of the month, the price of soybean oil had already risen to 37 or 38 yuan per hundred catties, and it is still rising. For example, Jiaozhou raw oil has risen to 34 yuan, Qingdao barrelled raw oil to 45 yuan, and Dalian soybean oil to 42.5 yuan. The price of Dahua Factory soybean oil in this port has also reached 32.7 or 32.8 yuan. Various sauce gardens and oil shops, due to the increased cost of incoming goods, have had to raise retail prices in order to cover their costs. Therefore, one yuan can buy less than two catties of oil, which has a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Cai Yukun, the acting chairman of the Soybean Oil and Grain Industry Association, and Chen Ziyi, the supervisory committee member, recognizing that the rising prices of soybean oil are having a significant impact on people's livelihoods, have advised their colleagues not to be exploited and manipulate the market.</p>

When this was discovered, it was punished in accordance with the heavier penalties for extraordinary periods, with a fine of 785 yuan to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>Japanese troops stationed in Tangqiao, south of the Huangpu River, were ambushed several times by Ding's guerrilla unit. Yesterday (the 11th), relying on the assistance of the naval forces along the Huangpu River, they launched a sudden counterattack against the guerrillas late at night, attempting to encircle Ding's unit from the rear. However, they fell into an ambush set by the guerrillas. Machine guns fired from all directions, annihilating over eighty Japanese soldiers without a single survivor. The Japanese naval forces stationed along the Huangpu River, hearing the alarm, dared not linger and retreated hastily towards the west bank of the Huangpu River. The guerrillas pursued them to the shore, sinking one small motorboat and drowning over thirty Japanese soldiers. Consequently, the town was recaptured by Ding's unit.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers in Xinchang厌战 Commit Suicide</p>
<p>Over one hundred Japanese and "puppet" troops are currently stationed in Xinchang Town, Pudong, concentrated in the Wang Family Garden. However, Chinese guerrillas are scattered in the surrounding villages, launching surprise attacks from time to time, resulting in daily casualties for the Japanese and "puppet" troops. The Japanese soldiers feel quite dejected. The day before yesterday, at 9:00 AM, five Japanese and "puppet" soldiers were patrolling to the Yuhuanggang Bridge east of the town when they discovered a pair of leather shoes and a letter. They were greatly surprised and recognized the leather shoes as belonging to a Japanese sentry, but the sentry was nowhere to be found. They opened the letter and found that it was the sentry's suicide note. They then learned that the Japanese soldier had committed suicide by drowning himself in the river due to homesickness and厭战 (厭戰). They immediately reported to the Japanese headquarters, recovered the body from the Erzaogang River, and prohibited any publicity.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Supplies Difficult to Transport on the Yangtze River</p>
<p>The Japanese army on the central Yangtze River front line faces great difficulties in transporting various military supplies due to repeated transshipments. Yesterday morning, several transport ships loaded with a large number of military supplies and gasoline departed from Shanghai to replenish supplies on the Yangtze River. (1) The giant Japanese transport ship "Kitaki Maru" arrived from Japan with over 3,000 tons of gasoline and berthed at buoys 3 and 4 in Hongkou, where it was transferred to another transport ship, the "Tokyo Maru," for onward transport to the Yangtze River. (2) The transport ship "Saga Maru" loaded a large number of military trucks at the China Merchants North Wharf in Hongkou and sailed for the Yangtze River yesterday morning. (3) The transport ships "Yuanjiang Maru" and "Wulu Maru" loaded a large number of military supplies at the China Merchants Central Wharf in Hongkou and also sailed for the Yangtze River yesterday morning.</p>

<p>It is learned that goods previously shipped from Shanghai to Ningbo that could not be imported due to the blockade of Zhenhai Port have now been rerouted via Shanghai-Wenzhou steamers to Zhejiang. Furthermore, it is learned that merchants from Zhejiang Province have been flocking to this port to purchase goods as before. Therefore, freight traffic between Zhejiang and Shanghai has not only not decreased due to the Zhenhai blockade but has also increased because of the peaceful situation in various parts of Zhejiang Province, with merchants requesting shipment of goods ordered from this port, resulting in a sudden increase in freight traffic between Shanghai and Wenzhou.</p>

<p>The *North China Daily News* reports that at 6:00 AM yesterday (the 11th), several fire engines from the Hongkou Fire Brigade were called to the burnt-out warehouse of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company opposite the Japanese Consulate General on Wuchang Road to pour water for over an hour. This was because smoke was rising again from the remnants of the major fire on the evening of March 24th. Last night, according to the opinion of experts, it is common for the embers to rekindle in the rubble. They believe that some bales of cotton have been smoldering continuously since the initial fire and say that cotton can burn again for months after catching fire. The fire engines poured water into the rubble pile, completely soaking the interior of the warehouse before driving back.</p>

<p>The Anti-British Alliance, organized by the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" under the direction of the Japanese, held its inaugural meeting in Pudong yesterday (the 11th). The puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan was elected as honorary chairman, and the chairman of the puppet "Anti-Communist Association," Zhu Ding, and the chairman of the puppet "Workers' Welfare Association," Hu Shouchang, were elected as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. Ishii, a senior advisor to the puppet "Municipal Government," serves as an advisor. They are now actively recruiting members and plan to establish a branch in each district under their rule where a puppet political affairs office is located. The aim is to force puppet officials and the people in the guerrilla zones to reject British goods and uniformly promote Japanese goods, thereby implementing economic aggression.</p>

<p>Since the puppet organizations in various places were established one after another under the direction of the Japanese, the general run of shameless puppets, with faces that should be blushing with shame, serve the enemy and obey the Japanese in everything, with flattery and obsequiousness knowing no bounds. People like Liang Hongzhi, Zhang Binghui, and Su Xiwu have all crossed to Japan to flatter the enemy. Recently, Fu Xiaoan, Gao Guanwu, and others have also gone to Japan and have not yet returned. According to reliable sources from the foreign community, Wen Zongyao, the puppet "President of the Legislative Yuan of the Reformed Government," and Chen Qun, the "Minister of the Interior," in order to further betray the nation, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, accompanied by a gang of scoundrels including the puppet "Legislative Councilors" Zhu Dazhang, the "Secretary" Ye Jingshuang, Xu Benqian, an advisor to the "Ministry of the Interior" Lin Gengyu, as well as He Yong, Qin Moxiao and others, by train. They are temporarily staying at the New Asia Hotel and are scheduled to board a Japanese ship tomorrow morning and cross to Japan.

<p>According to "Polish Communications," the mining industry in Poland has made very rapid progress in recent years. Scholars who study geology often go out for investigation and research, so new mines or important chemical raw materials are often discovered. Recently, the Central Geological Research Institute of Poland discovered a new copper mine in the Shtogrice-Ski Mountains in central Poland. Native copper was discovered 60 meters below the surface of the mine, and it also contains a small amount of silver. According to the report of the Geological Society, at least 2,500 tons of native copper can be obtained after the mine is mined. It is expected that preparations for mining will begin soon. In addition, a small copper mine containing a small amount of lead has also been discovered near Boromine.

<h3 id="e121">Opinions of Various Mass Organizations in This City on the Spiritual Mobilization (Continued) (End) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>(5) Spiritual mobilization should be promoted in accordance with the implementation measures promulgated by the Supreme National Defense Council. The promotion of the National Spiritual Mobilization work and the holding of monthly meetings in various organizations, institutions, schools, factories, and shops in this city should be led by the persons in charge of the respective organizations, institutions, schools, factories, and shops and by the Spiritual Mobilization Association of this city. At the same time, all lower-level organizations and the entire masses should immediately launch the mobilization from the grassroots level with a spirit of initiative and self-awareness and should not wait for the upper levels to lead before proceeding. Because the main purpose of spiritual mobilization is to mobilize a wider range of people to participate in the war of resistance, the implementation of preliminary civil rights, such as the rights of election, impeachment, and referendum, should be carried out as much as possible in the practice of mobilization—that is, in the organization process. Only in this way can the initiative and enthusiasm of the masses in this movement be enhanced, can this movement become a truly mass movement, and can the National Monthly Meeting become a truly democratic mass organization.</p>
<p>(6) The holding of the National Monthly Meeting should strive to avoid empty rituals of opening meetings and making oaths and should transform passive articles into active mass actions. However, the prescribed rituals should not be disrupted. Leaders and the masses, principals and students, factory directors and workers, managers and shop assistants, all who participate in the spiritual mobilization movement and take the oath should strictly abide by the twelve articles stipulated in the National Public Charter, supervise and encourage each other. Then the so-called "not selling Japanese goods" and other passive articles will become active actions such as "boycotting Japanese goods."</p>
<p>(7) New, broad, and unified mass organizations should be established in the National Spiritual Mobilization, and mass organizations should be expanded through this. However, it is by no means that various mass organizations will therefore abandon their original work. Cultural circles, student circles, vocational circles, women's circles, and labor circles must extensively use the National Spiritual Mobilization as a guideline to call on and organize the unorganized and backward masses to come to all circles. However, cultural circles will not therefore abandon in-depth research into various academic subjects, student circles will not therefore abandon the pursuit of students' own welfare, women's circles will not therefore abandon the task of women's liberation, and workers' circles will not therefore abandon the appropriate improvement of workers' own lives. Therefore, National Spiritual Mobilization can be said to be a comprehensive and national organization that adapts to the major goal of resisting the war and building the country, and the original organizations and work of all circles are precisely the only foundation for promoting this national organization.</p>
<p>(8) Mobilization committees and national monthly meetings should be established quickly in all circles and groups to promote mobilization work. However, in view of Shanghai's special environment, if various groups, institutions, schools, factories, and shops cannot hold joint monthly meetings for the entire body, they should be divided into small groups, departments, grades, workshops, etc. to hold monthly meetings separately, and representatives should be elected from each small group, department, grade, workshop, etc. to organize a representative joint monthly meeting, so that there is no gap between the upper and lower levels.</p>
<p>(9) All circles, groups, institutions, schools, factories, and shops, as well as all small groups, grades, departments, and workshops, should formulate concrete measures for mutual competition and mutual inspection to seek the effective development of the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement.</p>
<p>(10) All circles, groups, institutions, schools, factories, and shops should select the principles of the National Spiritual Mobilization that are most relevant to their original work as the central work of spiritual mobilization. For example, the cultural circles should take correcting erroneous remarks, opposing pro-Japanese compromising ideas, and promoting the national morality of loyalty and forgiveness as their central tasks. Other circles can be inferred by analogy.</p>
<p>(11) All circles, schools, institutions, and factories should promote general spiritual mobilization. On the one hand, party and government personnel and seven-level elements should be responsible for leadership, but on the other hand, various groups must serve as the core of promotion and supervision. For example, in schools, factories, and shops, the principal, factory director, and manager should lead the declaration, but for the promotion of the entire work, the Education Association, the Student Union, the Trade Union, various vocational circles, and various sports groups must bear the responsibility for practical promotion, so as to achieve the effect of the party and government, all circles, and all levels working together.</p>
<p>(12) Due to the special environment of Shanghai, all circles should, as far as possible, initiate various new organizations in accordance with the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, which is indicated to match the environment of their own work. However, this organization must have a subordinate relationship with all circles and then be led and instructed by party and government agencies through all circles. Shanghai various mass organizations,</p>

<h3 id="e122">Qiao Weiqing's Youngest Son, Changyin, States Living Conditions <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>His Actions Are Not Questioned by Anyone Other Than His Older Brother</p>
<p>Jia Yaochen Has the Same Surname as His Mother But Is Not His Maternal Uncle</p>
<p>The Dispute Over Guardianship Will Continue to Be Heard</p>
<p>Qiao Weiqing, a wealthy paint merchant, left behind millions in inheritance after his death. Initially, because his children were young, a management committee was organized by relatives and friends to manage the property and supervise the children. Over the years, although Qiao's eldest son, Qiao Changsheng, has reached adulthood and has married and had children, and although his relatives from his hometown of Zhenjiang have come to Shanghai several times to dispute the property and file lawsuits, the committee has never wavered. However, recently, cracks suddenly appeared among the guardians,</p>
<p>Separating into two factions, creating a state of opposition. Subsequently, Hu Weiyun filed a lawsuit with the First Special District District Court against Ren Yian, Na Changsheng, Chang Xiaosong, and others regarding the dispute over guardianship. Qiao's children Changsheng, Changyin, Shuying, and relatives Jia Yaochen, Zhou Shuqing, Xi Qiulianzhu, Fang Zhuhezhen, and Zhu Henian were all recruited by the two factions as important witnesses. The case was previously heard once, and those present resembled a meeting of the Qiao family's relatives. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Gui Yu, who is hearing the case, subpoenaed Qiao's</p>
<p>Youngest son Changyin and daughter Shuying to court for interrogation. Only Qiao Changyin appeared in court, stating that he is now eighteen years old and that Shuying is his older sister, now nineteen years old, and that she could not come because she was sick. Only he came to court to await instructions accompanied by an accountant from his home. The court first inquired about his current living conditions, family property, and whom he would like to be his guardian in the future. Changyin then answered in detail, saying that the family's livelihood has always been the responsibility of the management committee, that he is currently studying at home, that his biological mother, Jia, passed away eight or nine years ago,</p>
<p>That his actions are not questioned by anyone other than his older brother Changsheng, that Jia Yaochen is not his maternal uncle, and that because he has the same surname as his mother, he often comes to pester them. Initially, they gave him 40 yuan per month, so the receipts issued by Jia wrote the words "Qiao Mansion generous assistance," which is enough to prove that he is not his maternal uncle. Moreover, his mother never said that Jia was his maternal uncle when she was alive. As for Hu Weiyun, he does not know him at all, so he certainly cannot trust them, and he wishes to be under the guardianship of his older brother Changsheng, and that his sister-in-law</p>
<p>Treats him very well. He also said that he will marry on March 29th, and that his fiancée was chosen by himself, etc. The court then tested his knowledge and then asked about his words and actions at home, whether anyone was surrounding him, and whether what he was saying now was prearranged by others. If so, since he was in court, he did not need to worry and could state the facts truthfully. Changyin replied that what he said was all his own idea, and he presented the receipts of Jia Yaochen's payment to the court. Judge Gui decided to further</p>
<p>Encourage him, saying that young people should establish themselves, practice their skills, and be smart and capable. If their learning and knowledge are insufficient, no matter how rich their family property is, it will not be difficult to squander it all. You should know this. Changyin retreated after being instructed. As for the lawsuit between Hu Weiyun and Ren Yian and others regarding the guardianship of the Qiao family property, it is said that further investigation and trial will continue.</p>

<p>Zhang Jinqing Denies Conspiracy</p>
<p>Beggar Provides Details of Writing the Letter</p>
<p>Sentencing Postponed to the 19th</p>
<p>Sheng Ze Cheng (also known as Lao Si), a descendant of the late Qing Dynasty Palace Guardian Sheng Xingsun, lives at No. 75 Yuyuan Road. His nine-year-old son, Yupeng, attends the Western District Primary School of the Shanghai Municipal Council at No. 48 Daxilu Road. On the afternoon of the 20th of last month, at 3:10 PM, Chen Jindu, the son of Sheng's old servant Chen Luo, suddenly had a malicious thought and colluded with a female guide, pretending to be Sheng's family, hired a car and drove to the school, intending to</p>
<p>Lure Yupeng out and kidnap him for ransom. After the incident occurred, Hua Detective Wu Chengmo of the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested Chen Jindu and accomplice Zhang Zhixiong. Based on Chen's confession, they then arrested another accomplice, Zhang Jinqing, at No. 12 Miaolong Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and sent them to the First Special Court, where they were prosecuted by police lawyer Li Zhishan according to law. After the judge interrogated Chen Jindu, he confessed that this matter was done together with Zhang Jinqing, and that the threatening letter was written by</p>
<p>Zhang Zhixiong, but Zhang Jinqing denied it outright. The court hearing was adjourned. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing. Meng Huaquan, a tea servant at the Anshang Hotel, testified that on the 20th of last month, the defendant Chen Jindu came to the room at 10:00 AM alone and said that four people would come in the afternoon to play mahjong. He wrote the name "Shen Bujian," paid the room fee, and then went out. He returned at 2:00 PM and asked me to hire a female guide and call a taxi,</p>
<p>Then they got in the car and left. I did not see Zhang Jinqing, nor was there another car waiting at the door, etc. Then the female guide Shen Sanyuan testified that she was 18 years old. On that day, she was called to the defendant Chen Jindu's room by the tea servant. Chen ordered me to accompany him to the Carde Theater to watch a play. I agreed, and we got in the car together. Unexpectedly, the car drove to the school gate, and he got out and led a child and told him to call me aunt. I said I didn't know him. I don't know anything else. When questioned Chen Jindu,</p>
<p>He still insisted that he colluded with Zhang Jinqing, but Zhang vehemently denied it and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. Zhang Zhixiong, who confessed to being a beggar, said that he met Chen on the road one day and asked him to write a letter. He did not know the stakes, so he wrote several letters according to what he said and was actually used. Judge Fu verified the confession and announced that the debate in this case was over, and the defendants were detained to await sentencing on the 19th.</p>

<p>Den Owner Wang Qisheng Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wang Qisheng, a Cantonese native, had long been in the business of running opium dens. Recently, he established a large-scale opium den in Room 3, Xin Tai Building, No. 36 Sijing Road. The seats were always full and the opium pipes never idle, resulting in a very considerable daily income. This aroused the malicious intent of a group of gangsters, who would gather in droves daily,</p>
<p>demanding money, threatening to report him to the authorities, and disrupting his business. Unable to bear the harassment, Wang discussed with Pan Guixian, the doorkeeper of Xin Tai Building, about finding a better location. After Pan's deliberation, it was decided that Pan would lend Wang a room on the third floor as a place for customers to smoke opium. All the opium paraphernalia was also moved into Pan's room. From then on, it was indeed</p>
<p>possible to avoid the trouble of the gangsters. However, Wang's actions were suddenly discovered by Liu Zhaonian and Li Shugui, Chinese detectives of the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police, along with detectives Zhao Baosheng and Guo Shouxin. They immediately reported to the First Special District Court and obtained a search warrant. On the afternoon of the previous day at 1:30 PM, they rushed to Room 3 of Xin Tai Building to search, but found nothing. After further investigation,</p>
<p>they discovered the secret and then went to Pan's room to search. As expected, they found Chen Yifu from Ningbo and Yin Wanxiang indulging in opium smoking. Consequently, they arrested Wang Qisheng, the opium dealer Liao Chunchao, Pan Guixian, and the two opium smokers Chen and Yin. They confiscated thirty-seven and a half taels of opium, two opium pipes, and six account books.</p>
<p>They were taken back to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court Criminal Division yesterday morning. The defendants retained lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang for their defense. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi prosecuted them under Articles 5 and 9 of the Anti-Opium Law. After interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, Wang Qisheng was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and a fine of 200 yuan. The remaining defendants were acquitted. The opium paraphernalia and opium were confiscated.</p>

<p>Thieves Use Force to Threaten Vietnamese Constable</p>
<p>Vietnamese Constable Opens Fire, One Injured, Two Escape</p>
<p>The back door of Tian Lu Tea, Food, Candy Store at No. 58 Ganshi East Road in the French Concession is accessible through Lane 62 next door. Yesterday morning at 2:40 AM, three thieves sneaked in through Lane 62 and pried open the back door of Tian Lu Store. They stole a radio receiver, a silver box, and several pieces of clothing. As they were carrying the stolen goods out, a Vietnamese constable, No. 480 of the French Police, happened to pass by the entrance of Lane 62. Hearing noises inside the lane, he went in to investigate. He caught sight of the three thieves carrying stolen goods and trying to flee. The Vietnamese constable stepped forward to arrest them. Unexpectedly, two of the three thieves started attacking him, grabbing the Vietnamese constable by the throat and holding his hands, preventing him from shouting or moving. The other thief drew a small knife, intending to cut the leather strap of the holster containing the constable's pistol, in order to seize the pistol and threaten him. Fortunately, the Vietnamese constable was very strong and struggled fiercely, narrowly averting danger. Seeing that they could not resist, the three thieves fled with the stolen goods. The Vietnamese constable drew his pistol and chased after them, firing seven shots. Two thieves, hearing the gunshots, abandoned the stolen goods and fled. The other thief, Zhang Jinbao (22 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 7, Lian Yi Li, Haining Road), was hit by five bullets, fell wounded outside the back door of No. 15 in Lane 62. The Vietnamese constable reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to take the wounded Zhang Jinbao to Guangci Hospital for treatment. His injuries are said to be very serious, but his life can be saved if no complications arise. Meanwhile, detectives recovered the stolen goods near the scene of the incident and took them back to the police station. The owner of the store was notified. A police chief dispatched detectives to investigate and arrest the two thieves who had escaped, for interrogation.</p>

As for the damage caused by the soldiers' fighting, it was nearly 1,000 Marks. In addition, three hours of business were lost, so the total loss was quite considerable. It was also reported that the injured dancer had returned home from the hospital to recuperate. New windows and glass countertops have been purchased for the ballroom. There were no special guards at the entrance, only a team of American military police standing in front of the door, who soon walked towards a patrol car parked nearby. Last night, most of the bars did not see any traces of Italian soldiers. It is said that they were all kept in the barracks and not allowed to go out, pending an investigation into the dispute.</p>

<p>Girl Thirteen, Boy Twenty: Girl's Father Petitions for Invalidity of Engagement</p>
<p>Wang Beishi, a Ningbo native residing at No. 29 Baoyu Fang, Chengdu Road, in the Public Concession, is thirteen years old this year. Her mother has passed away, and her father, Wang Caixiang, age forty-four, is her legal guardian. He, along with retained lawyer Shen Ronghua, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against her fiancé, Cui Yongkang (age twenty, Ningbo native, residing at No. 5 Hong Sheng, No. 4 Tong An Li, Lao Yong An Street), seeking confirmation of the invalidity of the engagement. The court, according to the petition, summoned both parties to the Civil Court Seven yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Wu Xiaoke. Each party arrived with their lawyer. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the plaintiff was engaged to the defendant by her mother when she was eleven years old in the 26th year of the Republic. Now, the plaintiff opposes and disagrees with this engagement, and therefore, in accordance with Articles 972 and 973 of the Civil Code, seeks a judgment confirming the invalidity of the engagement. The defendant's representative, lawyer Xu Lianghao, argued for the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit, stating that the plaintiff's legal guardian was clearly aware that the engagement was illegal at the time. Now that the plaintiff is unwilling to fulfill the engagement, it is not related, and only the defendant's losses need to be compensated, which can be resolved without filing a lawsuit. After the court's review, the parties were instructed to go outside to conduct a settlement. The case was rescheduled for hearing on the 22nd.</p>

<p>Striking a Chinese Constable in the Buttocks</p>
<p>Around 11:50 PM last night, five or six robbers suddenly went to a residence of a certain family name at the intersection of Foch Road and Coubert Road in the French Concession to commit robbery. At the time, the robbers pretended to be visitors, tricking them into opening the front door. They watched the people in the house. One robber kept watch, while the others divided up to search for loot. However, a servant in the house was unusually vigilant. Seeing that the visitors were not good, he immediately slipped out of the house and ran to the No. 340 post at the intersection of Coubert Road to report. The constable on duty, upon hearing the news, quickly reported to the police station and rushed to arrest them first. Unexpectedly, because the lookout robber was hiding in a concealed place, the constable did not notice him. The robber, taking advantage of the constable's unpreparedness, jumped out and punched him in the head, causing a red and swollen lump. The constable lost his balance and almost fell. The robber then drew his gun and fired at the constable's buttocks, causing him to fall to the ground. The robbers inside the house, suddenly hearing gunshots outside, knew that something was wrong and did not have time to rob. They all fled out the door. By the time a large number of detectives arrived, the robbers had already disappeared. They then inquired with the victims and sent the injured constable to the hospital for treatment, and began the pursuit.</p>

Subsequently, during annual inspections of secondary schools by Ministry, provincial, and municipal inspectors, close attention and investigations should be paid; 2. Provincial and municipal education bureaus should continue to conduct free examinations and verifications for secondary school teachers, and those who pass the examination and verification should be given certificates stating the effective period; 3. Teachers who pass the verification should be required to participate in summer training courses each year and join secondary education research associations within the teacher training college districts to study secondary school teaching issues in various subjects; 4. Summer training courses for secondary school teachers should be organized by teacher training colleges in principle. Participants must write papers on their lecture results or research insights as an examination. Those who fail may have their verification certificate revoked; 5.

<h3 id="e147">The Heroic Feat of Sixteen Children – The Xin'an Children's Touring Troupe in the Mainland <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Traveled 30,000 Miles Across the Country</p>
<p>Now in Guilin Participating in Cave Education</p>
<p>The Xin'an Children's Touring Troupe, organized by Xin'an Elementary School in Huai'an County, Jiangsu Province, once came to Shanghai three years ago and was warmly welcomed by children's educators in this city. After leaving Shanghai on the Double Tenth Festival of 1935, the troupe went deep into the mainland and traveled across the country, enduring hardships. They are now in Guilin carrying out propaganda work. The following is a report on their struggles over the past three years from the troupe's advisor's recent letter to a friend in Shanghai:</p>
<p>Itinerary</p>
<p>The troupe left Shanghai on the Double Tenth Festival of 1935 to go to the mainland to promote the national crisis. The places they passed through include Zhenjiang, Bengbu, Anqing, Wuhu, Nanjing, Nanxiang, Songjiang, Jiashan, Hangzhou, etc. In the spring of 1936, they followed the Shanghai Women and Children's Comfort Team to Suiyuan Baotou. After the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, they went to Ningxia, Pingliang, Lanzhou, Xi'an, Wuhan and other places to promote the War of Resistance. The itinerary reached 30,000 miles. Wherever they went, they performed drama, singing, and film screenings, which were enthusiastically supported and welcomed by the local people.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<p>The troupe currently has sixteen members, the oldest is twenty-two years old, and the youngest is fourteen years old. There is only one adult, the advisor. Internally, there are five sections: general affairs, propaganda, self-education, editing, and public relations. The source of funding is entirely from the children selling articles, selling books and newspapers, and showing anti-Japanese educational films (tickets are a few cents). Therefore, life is extremely difficult. In Ningxia, Chairman Ma donated 400 yuan, and in Gansu, Chairman Gan donated 600 yuan. The daily routine, except for special circumstances that require changes, is to get up at 6:00 AM every morning, tidy up and do morning exercises, climb mountains or race. After that, breakfast, study for an hour, hold a life meeting, with the chairman rotating, and practice singing for an hour, then free work, including writing articles, reading newspapers, and studying academic subjects. Lunch at 12:00 PM, a one-hour nap after meals, then free work, dinner at 6:00 PM, free activities in the evening, and sleep at 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>Covenant</p>
<p>The troupe's covenant has been changed in Lanzhou to adapt to wartime, as follows: (1) Strive to seize opportunities to learn propaganda work, and pay attention to correctness and efficiency, to increase the strength of the War of Resistance and national construction; (2) Implement all common resolutions; (3) Complete the work to be done, create new work records; (4) Have appropriate exercise habits every day; (5) Sleep eight hours a day; (6) Do not eat snacks at will other than the food that should be eaten every day; (7) Pay attention to drinking water and defecation every day; (8) Read books, read newspapers, and write diaries every day; (9) Hold a life meeting once a day; (10) Hold various meetings on schedule; (11) Enthusiastically do the temporary work assigned by the chairman and the troupe affairs staff; (12) If you have something to do outside, you must notify the chairman and the troupe affairs staff and register; (13) Those who violate group discipline shall be given warnings, demerits, and revocation of membership by the general assembly; (14) Those who make special contributions to the group and the national policy of the War of Resistance and national construction shall be given the most glorious awards by the general assembly; (15) This covenant shall be implemented after being revised in Lanzhou.</p>
<p>Plan</p>
<p>The troupe is now participating in cave education in Guilin. Their future plans are as follows: (1) Request government guidance and assistance; (2) Expand mechanized equipment suitable for actual needs, including a 1200-watt generator, a 35mm sound projector, a 16mm projector, a large radio, as well as a camera, telescope, and simple scientific instruments necessary for travel; (3) Expand the scope of propaganda work for the War of Resistance and national construction; (4) Increase the number of courses required for reality; (5) Determine the source of funding; (6) Link up with various work groups for the War of Resistance and national construction to exert the power of the entire nation's War of Resistance and national construction.</p>

<p>The second individual table tennis tournament of the Zhejiang Xingye Bank Table Tennis Team was initiated, with more than twenty people participating in the competition. The results were best for Wu Zhaofeng, the champion of the previous tournament, and Sun Ding'an, a rising star of the ball sport. The championship match was held last night at the bank's club, with Li Jingru of Meifeng as the referee. Wu drew the ball very steadily, but unfortunately he was fatter and moved slower. Sun was thin and always used a chop to defend, with excellent placement. The two drew and chopped, which was very exciting. After four intense games, Wu was eventually defeated by Sun 3-1 due to insufficient strength. Sun won the championship in this tournament amid applause, while Wu took second place.

<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Ma Xiangbo, a centenarian, lives a very hygienic life. When he was in Beijing, he ate two eggs and a cup of tofu juice for breakfast every day. For lunch and dinner, he often ate pigeon egg soup, sweet potatoes, and vegetables. He never smoked or drank alcohol.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui loves to eat sesame cakes, often saying that this thing is cheap and beautiful, and it is a mass-market food.</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Lizi, a member of the Central Committee, likes to eat Shaoxing dried tofu and often uses it as a snack with wine.</p>
<p>Dr. Ma Junwu, who once served as the Chairman of Guangxi Province and is now the President of Guangxi University, in addition to liking to translate books and raise bees, is also very fond of cigarettes. He needs more than one hundred and twenty yuan a month, and he likes to chew and eat the remaining cigarette butts.</p>
<p>In addition to being fond of alcohol and peanuts, Mr. Ye Chuqian also likes to eat spiced beans. When he was the editor of the Republican Daily, there was almost no day that this thing was not placed on his desk.</p>
<p>Long Yun, the Chairman of Yunnan Province, likes to eat specially made dumplings from Lanzhou, Gansu (the filling is made by virgins). He must send someone to the area to customize a certain amount during the three finals of New Year's Day, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival every year.</p>
<p>General Bai Chongxi was besieged in Nanning that year. Because the food supply was cut off, he filled his stomach with black beans.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang not only abstains from alcohol and tobacco, but also does not drink tea. He only drinks boiled water every day.</p>
<p>Li Shizeng, a veteran of the Party and the country, has a simple diet that is very suitable for ordinary people. He only eats two dishes and one soup per meal. Therefore, people say: "The meal of Central Committee member Li Shizeng is not as good as the smoke of Dr. Zheng Yuxiu."</p>
<p>Dr. Gu Weijun, a diplomat, likes to eat Chinese-made stinky tofu. When he went to France as an ambassador a few years ago, he hired a chef who specialized in making stinky tofu. On one occasion, a French friend visited Gu and happened to smell this strange smell. He asked about it, and Gu replied: "This is a small scientific invention in our country, not worth mentioning." The friend asked to visit, and Gu replied: "This small invention cannot be visited by anyone before it is successful according to our country's regulations, so we can only wait until it is successful to ask for guidance." This matter spread to the country and became a good story in diplomatic circles.</p>
<p>When Niu Yongjian was the Chairman of Jiangsu Province, the provincial government kitchen provided two types of boxed lunches: special (50 cents per person) and ordinary (20 cents per person). Niu often ate the ordinary type.</p>
<p>Among literary figures, Lu Xun likes to eat peanuts, Yu Dafu likes to drink alcohol (preferably beer), Guo Moruo loves to eat candy, Wang Luyan likes to eat pomelos, and Lin Yutang is fond of cigars.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Random Chat on Pajamas <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhenxiong</p>
<p>In ordinary families in our country, pajamas are extremely rare; precisely because they are so few, one could almost say they don't exist at all. When one of your female friends boasts about how many clothes she has, if you were to ask her how many sets of pajamas she owns, that would definitely make her very disappointed and think you are intentionally teasing her! Some don't even know what pajamas are. This is taking women as an example! How many men know about pajamas and own them? But the truth is, those who have studied abroad and admire Westernization, men and women in universities or wealthy families, mostly have a bathrobe, and they treat it as pajamas! But strictly speaking, a bathrobe is a bathrobe, and pajamas are pajamas; even if you have a bathrobe, it's the same as not having pajamas!</p>
<p>So what are pajamas like? Simply put, a short coat and a pair of pants! But their usefulness is not insignificant. Usually, when we go to bed, most men wear a vest and shorts, with the exception of children and middle-aged or older people, and as for women, I'm sorry to say I don't know. In cold weather, they add a short coat and long pants. But this outfit that's added is never a separate set, but the same short shirt and pants worn that day are put on. This is detrimental; first, the clothes easily get dirty and wrinkled, and second, the oily dirt on the collar and cuffs often stains the clean mattress and sheets, which is so disgusting! So if you wear pajamas, all these drawbacks are eliminated! Moreover, the style of pajamas is generally looser and doesn't use buttons, so it doesn't hinder breathing or cause pressure pain on the skin after sleeping, and because you change clothes in the morning and evening, you develop a habit of cleanliness and frequent changing of clothes! For people who kick the covers at night, they won't catch a cold!</p>
<p>The above are just a few points I thought of to mention! There are other special features, which you will experience after wearing them. Now, let me add a word about the material and style of pajamas; towel cloth is the best material, but soft and smooth fabrics are also suitable. Using white satin would be too extravagant and excessive! In the end, softness and maintaining body temperature are paramount. The style is similar to ordinary clothes and pants, the difference being that they are loose and don't use buttons, but use ties to knot instead, so you can adjust the tightness as you like! This is especially good for the stomach, because it's not good to constrict it too tightly when sleeping! I've included two rough sketches, one for men and one for women, for readers' reference. The women's sleeves and waist are narrower, and there is an extra tie at the waist. The cuffs are folded collars, while the men's have no collar for maximum comfort. At first glance, the pants look the same for men and women, but in fact, the women's pant legs should be much narrower, which is very suitable and stylish!</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>In last week's menu, I introduced two fresh seasonal meat dishes for spring. This week, I will introduce one or two fresh seasonal vegetarian dishes, which are not only palatable and filling but also don't violate economic principles. One is wolfberry with stir-fried bamboo shoots. Wolfberry is cooling in nature, and stir-frying it with bamboo shoots creates a unique flavor that surpasses even pea sprouts. However, you must use more sugar and oil; if you put too little, it won't be flavorful. The other is lettuce salad with bamboo shoots, also a wonderful accompaniment to rice or porridge. The bamboo shoots must be steamed first, and the lettuce must be squeezed with salt, then mixed with soy sauce and sesame oil. The method is extremely simple. Don't throw away the lettuce leaves. Stir-fry them with diced bamboo shoots, which is certainly delicious; what's even better is to use them to cook rice, adding some diced meat, diced bamboo shoots, soy sauce, and lard, which is fragrant and rich, ten times better than the vegetable rice sold in the market.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>Chive and shredded pork stir-fry, braised small mandarin fish, wolfberry with stir-fried bamboo shoots, pickled mustard greens with mung bean sprouts</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>Pickled fish with braised pork, clear stewed knife fish, shrimp roe with gluten, stir-fried garland chrysanthemum</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>Thousand-layer tofu stewed with pickled fish, chive sprouts with scrambled eggs, lettuce salad with bamboo shoots, braised cabbage</p>
<p>Thursday</p>
<p>Onion beef slices, prawns with braised tofu, Beijing preserved cabbage with bean curd sheets, fried dough sticks in vermicelli soup</p>

<h3 id="e160">Shanghai People's Breakfast <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Time passes in a cycle from morning to dusk and back again from dusk to morning; people's eating also cycles from breakfast to dinner and back again from dinner to breakfast; however, morning is always considered the beginning of the day's life, and breakfast is the first meal—the nourishment that must be taken before the start of the day's work, just like the principle that oil must be added before a machine starts running, so in the morning, people of all social strata must first fill their stomachs before going to work.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, although there are many types of food, including Sichuan, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Western cuisines, the different tastes are divided into classes by money, from the breakfast in Western restaurants to the scallion pancake stalls at the alley entrances. In between, I really don't know how many levels there are? And I don't know how many ways people eat? In the morning, walking into the large restaurants and tea rooms on Nanjing Road, you'll see that they are full of gentlemen and ladies with delicate appetites, taking a glass of milk and two slices of white toast, or a few chicken buns and duck dumplings, as breakfast. In Western restaurants, naturally, they eat Western-style breakfasts; however, those Chinese people who eat foreign breakfasts know that the taste is not as satisfying as eating a bowl of leftover overnight dishes with porridge at home, but in order to show off and flaunt their wealth, they have to go in and out of Western restaurants, affecting the manners of Westerners.</p>
<p>The next level of people flock to noodle restaurants or snack sections attached to restaurants, a bowl of noodles or a serving of soup dumplings for ten cents can also be taken as breakfast; this kind of breakfast, which is between noble and humble, doesn't cost much money and looks very generous. Although it's not enough compared to the top, it's more than enough compared to the bottom, so it's most welcomed by the salary class who value both economy and face. Those places are always extremely crowded every morning, with no empty seats.</p>
<p>What about the next level of breakfast? It seems to be the porridge and noodles sold at stalls. These stalls are set up on the edges of city streets or near farmers' markets, with a board as a table. Most of the patrons are shop assistants, workers, and vendors, who sit down and feast on the board, stir-fried noodles with pork head meat, mutton porridge, beef, fried tofu, and vermicelli soup, which can also be appropriately arranged according to their appetite. To some of the more noble people, taking this kind of food as breakfast might seem too meager? In fact, you can also say, "Not enough compared to the top, but more than enough compared to the bottom." Those scallion pancake buckets, pancake stalls, soybean milk stalls, baked sweet potatoes, glutinous rice balls... set up at the entrances of various alleys, there are even more people who take these foods as breakfast; the general porters and hawkers, the crowd who exchange labor for life, and the unemployed vagrants, eat with relish, just like the noble people eating Western food, chicken and duck meat noodles, and shrimp dumplings, they are equally able to fill their stomachs, and can equally serve as breakfast—although the price is low and the quality is poor.</p>
<p>Shanghai people's breakfast is thus divided into different quality levels by money!</p>

<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>There are many items in the General Mobilization of the National Spirit program that we need to implement one by one. I believe that all citizens of the Republic of China, under the same belief in resisting the war and building the nation, will certainly be happy to accept them. However, although there are many items, I believe that the most basic first step is for each person to join various groups separately.</p>
<p>Of course, even if everyone doesn't join any group, but only does their own thing, they can still mobilize their own spirit and contribute to the country and nation. However, this will lead to drawbacks: First, the various forces cannot be concentrated, and the efficiency of the forces will inevitably be reduced; second, without mutual supervision, it is easy to generate a sense of slackness; third, those whose spirits are never lifted, or those who intentionally evade, cannot be mobilized together. Therefore, we either don't want general mobilization of the spirit, or if we want to implement general mobilization of the spirit, then everyone must join various groups separately. For example, the citizens in the agricultural sector should join the agricultural branch of the National Spirit General Mobilization Association, those in the industrial sector should join the industrial branch, and so on for the business sector, the education sector, and any other sector. As for those who serve in a certain agency, association, company, or any established group, if the group has a branch organization, they should naturally also join and work together.</p>
<p>Foreigners have always mocked us for not having unity: even Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that we used to be like a plate of loose sand. Since the founding of the Republic of China, although there have been many expressions of unity, and since the War of Resistance, although the loose sand has become a piece of fused strong iron, if we don't constantly strive to improve and temper our unity, it will still be possible to disintegrate at any time, and the strong iron will also tend to corrode, so general mobilization of the spirit is necessary, and the first step is for each person to join various groups. Joining various groups allows us to concentrate our forces. Joining a group is implementing general mobilization of the spirit!</p>
<p>Humans are inherently gregarious animals; those who like to live alone or who are mavericks, although they consider themselves to be aloof and receive praise from some people, are, in reality, violating nature, hindering the progress of civilization, and are ultimately not worth following. Therefore, even in peacetime, everyone should have group life, and now, resisting the war and building the nation is such a great cause, which cannot be done without collective wisdom and effort, and we should take actively participating in group life as the starting point!</p>
<p>I hope: that everyone who has already joined a group will continue to work hard, and those who have not yet joined should go and join the group they consider suitable for themselves at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e162">The First Night at the Front Line <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Dragging our bodies, which had been conquered by hunger and fatigue, softly out of the division headquarters, we all thought we could grope our way back, based on the little experience we had when we came. Unexpectedly, we had only walked a short distance from the door when we got lost in the vast, boundless wilderness shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>Our right front was illuminated by a frightening, red light, and the deep blue sky, dotted with countless sparkling little stars, was also reddened by the intense light. The non-stop firing of guns and cannons was densely mixed together, as if trying to tear apart this world shrouded in darkness. In this deafening and chaotic gunfire, the machine gun fire, which sounded like an elliptical anvil, was very crisp: ta-ta-ta-ta-ta...</p>
<p>"Which way to go?"</p>
<p>"I remember: we passed a ridge when we came, how did we get to these wheat fields? There's not even a road, look, which way to go?"</p>
<p>"Be careful! Don't go to the enemy's defense line, you have to know that this is already on the front line!"</p>
<p>After a brief discussion, everyone decided to return to the division headquarters. Feeling our way in the darkness, we had not walked far when suddenly a messenger came out of the headquarters and led us back to Shila.</p>
<p>We couldn't see anything clearly on the road, so we clustered tightly together and groped our way forward. But our feet were often blocked by something, almost causing us to fall to the ground. Sometimes, our feet would sink into some mud ponds, making it impossible for us to pull them out!</p>
<p>The evening breeze was a bit chilly, blowing in gusts, and the wheat seedlings in the fields were rustling and shaking, as if enemies were walking out of the fields. We walked silently, but kept our eyes wide open and kept watch. The sound of guns and cannons was still lively and loud, and the red light was still so bright and dazzling, like the moment when the sun first comes out.</p>
<p>After passing through the warning line, we finally returned to the small room where we lived. We pushed the door open and went in, and saw that the room was full of more than a dozen comrades, sleeping haphazardly.</p>
<p>"Hey, haven't you eaten yet?""The only female comrade who hadn't fallen asleep, wearing her tweed coat, climbed up from a thin sorghum stalk and greeted us.</p>
<p>"Haven't eaten, have you eaten?"</p>
<p>"Eaten!" She simply answered, and then picked up a basket of cold, dry rice from the table and handed it to us: "Eat quickly! Eat quickly!"</p>
<p>We chewed a mouthful of cold, dry rice, and couldn't swallow it anymore. We looked at her longingly, "Do you have any vegetables?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Do you have any salt?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Everyone couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>We devoured a few mouthfuls of rice like wolves, considering it as having eaten. But how to sleep? There were so many people in one place, and there was even a female comrade mixed in...</p>
<p>This female comrade's surname was Tang. It is said that when our troops were stationed in Dean, Jiangxi, she resolutely abandoned her family and school and joined our army. This rare event was then reported extensively in the Jiangxi newspapers. Although other people harbored a kind of disdain towards this young female comrade because of her work ability, I respected her very much. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, out of the 225 million female compatriots in the entire population, how many have sacrificed everything like her to come to the front line? Just from this point alone, I think she is worthy of respect.</p>
<p>"Get up, it's better to rearrange the bedding before sleeping. Otherwise, how can so many people sleep?"</p>
<p>"Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!..." Comrade Tang sang the March of the Volunteers comically, which made the people who were being attacked by sleep laugh involuntarily.</p>
<p>One here, one there, the people who were just about to fall asleep got up unwillingly, and everyone moved the table and the pile of furniture away, and each person busied themselves spreading the prepared gray felt on the ground. Comrade Tang also joined in the lively competition and spread the gray felt on the ground near the door. All the space was covered with gray felt, but I was still holding my gray felt in my hand with no place to put it down.</p>
<p>"Where is my place to sleep?"</p>
<p>"Isn't there still room to sleep next to Comrade Tang?" Everyone looked at me and giggled as if they had done something triumphant.</p>
<p>"There..." I was embarrassed by the laughter, and couldn't help but giggle along with them, the room was filled with the energetic laughter of young people.</p>
<p>Looking at Comrade Tang's uninhibited and frank appearance of sleeping there, I shyly spread the gray felt down. To my surprise, the laughter also disappeared with it. The only thing heard in the room was the intense sound of guns and cannons outside the door...</p>

<p>— Wen Zongshan</p>
<p>The woodpecker specializes in searching for its food in the trees, while the pests residing in the trees are always avoiding its target.</p>
<p>There are always two different types of people standing in opposition in society, which cannot be resolved with emotion, namely, the brave and the lowest class of people.</p>
<p>Late at night, thinking about this small issue, I hope to give me an exceptionally accurate answer to clarify my thoughts.</p>
<p>Today, I found a satisfactory answer and saw the pictographic woodpecker and the corrosive worm. To put it bluntly, the brave and the lowest class of people are staging very vivid and magnificent deeds in opposition.</p>
<p>Penetrating into the temptation of profit, in the abyss of wealth, such a person, a low-class fellow, was killed by the brave man with justice. Some people are surprised, calling this "assassination." I say: It's unremarkable. Many people are willing to do things that "die for gold mining," not to mention that the quickness of this death is directly proportional to the speed of his "going to sea" seeking fame and wealth. You say it's strange, what's strange is that the method of his death is unremarkable, not to everyone's liking. Let's put him to death under the law.</p>
<p>The writing worm can absolutely not escape the woodpecker's sharp beak, you should know; when its sharp beak and tongue curl up the worm, it is the opportunity to tell you the answer.</p>
<p>The lowest class of people will one day be finished by the brave.</p>

<p>Late at night, after drinking, my spirit is much more excited, and everything I usually can't think of surges to my mind; what a great stimulus the sudden news is!</p>
<p>Warrior! You sacrificed yourself fearlessly, calmly and generously, raising your voice and shouting slogans, cursing the shameless traitors. Is your voice more powerful than the explosion of thousands of pounds of bombs? It shook the depths of the hearts of everyone in the dead city. You are so glorious! So valuable! You see your responsibilities so clearly and you have carried them out one by one; I deeply admire you, thank you, and will always remember you and mourn for you. I can't help but sob in the dark, and looking at the horizon, there is endless sorrow, warrior! May you be well!</p>
<p>I know that you have suffered the most cruel pain in the world, shedding drops of blood under the lash, and enduring for one second is enough to make you leave this world. Warrior! Did you endure it? Your flesh was shattered, your blood was exhausted, for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>Sleep well! Warrior! Spring has awakened again, may you live forever: with the azure sky and the verdant rivers and mountains accompanying you, you can sleep well! Your cannon shot has just struck our vanguard, and our brothers are now more active, vowing to follow behind you and shed some hot blood for your motherland. You have left, and there are countless successors. We will all become bombs, exploding one by one, until your motherland is well!

<h3 id="e168">"Eating Arsenic to Kill a Tiger" <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Fu</p>
<p>The world will never run out of clever people. They say: The first is to harm others and benefit oneself: The second is to benefit oneself and benefit others: The third is—no, the third is not allowed—! The third is not to harm oneself or harm others: As for the fourth, harming oneself to benefit others, only the biggest fools in the world would do so, and it is even more unacceptable! In short, clever people have their own unique spirit: They want to live, not die, and even if they have to seek a solution out of desperation, if they can't live well, they should live badly, and they never want to die well. They say that it's better to live badly than to die well, so eating arsenic to kill a tiger becomes the object of their ridicule.</p>
<p>When they encounter a tiger, they will definitely offer it pigs and sheep to satisfy the tiger's appetite. When the pigs and sheep are gone, the tiger stares at them, seemingly wanting to get them and be satisfied, and they will at most hide, and never dare to resist. They say, what a huge thing a tiger is, how dare they touch a hair on its body and invite suffering on themselves. If you look at those who flee, they can only kneel on the ground and beg pitifully, and even when the tiger opens its mouth to swallow them, even if they have arsenic in their hands, they are not willing to stuff it into their own mouths, and hope that they can eventually be "saved from the tiger's mouth." But we can imagine the result of such people, it's nothing more than being a light snack for the tiger, without any feeling.</p>
<p>Perhaps no clever person in the world would see a tiger about to eat him, and actually be so stupid as to do so. However, there are indeed such clever people in the world who see a crisis like a tiger wanting to kill them, unable to escape, unable to fight, and ultimately dare not generously go to death and fight with their lives. They only want to beg, and are indeed doing the "plotting with a tiger for its skin" thing. They say that survival is the first priority; a lose-lose situation is not worth it.</p>
<p>They dream of "co-existence and co-prosperity" with the tiger; they think the tiger also has humanity and can be reasoned with; they even think that even if they are eaten by the tiger, they can still survive in another way! As a ghost, getting the employment of the tiger master. Therefore, they think that their theory is perfect, the facts are thoughtful, and they have long been in an invincible position. As long as they seek peace with the tiger, they can live this way or that way. Only resisting the tiger, in their opinion, is the last resort.</p>
<p>In fact, tigers are often "paper tigers", which, when poked through, reveal their ugly nature. Even if it's not a paper tiger, it's just a "dog-headed tiger", and with its instincts, it will only steal pigs and sheep, and ultimately doesn't have the courage and strength to eat people. As long as people see it, they should strike it head-on - any weapon will do, it doesn't have to be a fast gun. If it is really a golden-eyed, white-browed big insect that will indeed eat people, then we should desperately fight, and if we can't beat it, we should eat arsenic and poison it! Anyway, we're going to die, why not die together with it!</p>
<p>I praise the spirit of eating arsenic to kill a tiger. With this spirit, I think even if the tiger had knowledge, it would retreat three times. Clever people's ridicule is prepared to be ghosts. Since we are not prepared to be ghosts, what do we care about ridicule! With this spirit, we can eradicate the tiger's breath, and we can see the clever people's ridicule fall on their own heads.</p>

<h3 id="e169">A Northeastern Merchant's Words of Blood and Tears <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>The Recent Situation of the Puppet "Manchukuo" Film Industry Under Iron Heels</p>
<p>Since the fall of the four northeastern provinces and the rise of the puppet regime, which became the fake "Manchukuo," the people have been living a miserable and subhuman existence under oppression. All businesses, especially the film industry, which falls under the cultural sector, have been subject to intensified oppression and exploitation, treating them like beasts of burden. Recently, a merchant from the Northeast, now in Shanghai, spoke of the dire situation there, truly filled with blood and tears! Here, I provide a brief account to reveal the true state of the Northeast film industry under its dark and hopeless conditions.</p>
<p>Film Censorship</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Japanese advisors, the puppet "Manchukuo" film censorship was initially very disorganized, with each province and region conducting its own inspections. This resulted in arbitrary decisions based on personal preferences, lacking any clear standards. Films that were screened in one area were often banned in another. Films that were heavily censored in one place might be shown completely untouched in another. These inexplicable censorship events often left film merchants at a loss, causing them unspeakable suffering. In July 1934, the so-called "Unified Policy for Eastern Film Censorship" was promulgated, placing the administration under the puppet "Ministry of Civil Affairs' Police Department." From that point on, film censorship was considered "unified."</p>
<p>Enslaving Films</p>
<p>Japanese films also had to undergo censorship before being shown in the puppet "Manchukuo." However, this was merely a formality. In reality, Japanese films that could be shown publicly were never subject to any difficulties in the puppet "Manchukuo." Moreover, some of their enslaving films, masquerading as promoting "East Asian peace," often received commendation from the puppet "Ministry of Civil Affairs." However, some Japanese films were simply intended for their own enjoyment.</p>
<p>Grievous Exploitation</p>
<p>Not long ago, a so-called "Film Administration Bureau" was established to manage all film administration within the puppet "Manchukuo." Like other institutions, it was nominally headed by puppet "officials," but the real power was held by Japanese advisors. The "Bureau" implemented strict control over films, requiring all imported films to be handed over for management, and business operations were also to be controlled by them. The "Bureau" took a 40% cut of all business revenue, leaving the film owners with only 60%. This exploitative practice was unreasonably tyrannical. The price for the right to show domestic films in the Northeast, including all expenses, was about four thousand yuan per film. Therefore, the business revenue for each film had to exceed seven thousand yuan to break even. The merchants' profits were all seized, making them no different from beasts of burden.</p>
<p>The Recent State of Domestic Films</p>
<p>As for domestic films shown in the puppet "Manchukuo," they are mostly old, purely entertainment-oriented films from several years ago. Any domestic films with even a hint of national consciousness or contemporary thought would absolutely not be shown there. The puppet "Manchukuo" authorities' prohibition of such films is extremely strict, and film merchants dare not risk engaging in such life-threatening business.</p>
<p>Finally, according to him, he had long given up on such a bestial existence. Although he had been forced to do it for livelihood reasons in the past, he could not help but feel ashamed in his conscience, suffering from intangible condemnation and feeling extremely uneasy. In short, people who have not personally experienced the inhuman life in this dark circle cannot know how miserable it is.</p>
<p>Shameful Events in the Performing Arts World</p>
<h3 id="e170">Zhao Xiaolan Actually Performs in a Puppet Show <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Ju Shi (Playwright)</p>
<p>Her Motivation for Going South Was Purely an Invitation from the Puppets</p>
<p>What Will the Shanghai Entertainment Circle Think?</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaolan is an indoor disciple of Shang Xiaoyun. She is not a top-tier star, but among female performers in Beijing, she is considered a talented individual. Below the likes of Xue Yanqin and Zhang Eyun, Zhao can also occupy a place. Moreover, Zhao had twice decided to go south, once with Shou Shengzao at the Huangjin Grand Theater, and the second time performing at the Xinyuan Carlton, both times returning north with praise. Recent news has shocked those who appreciate Zhao's artistic talent. It is said that Zhao has recently been singing and dancing in Nanjing, to the "pleasure" of the puppets.</p>
<p>After hearing this news, the writer inquired among members of the Shanghai performing arts world, but they were also unaware of the details. Therefore, I wrote to a friend residing in Beijing, and finally obtained information about the public sentiment regarding Zhao's trip south. I record it to inform the entertainment circle in Shanghai, and even more so, I hope the performing arts world will express their views on this matter.</p>
<p>The puppet government in Nanjing held a so-called ceremony for the "Inaugural Through Train on the Tianjin-Pukou Line." The puppet officials, both big and small, organized a "sightseeing tour" to Nanjing, and accompanying this "sightseeing tour" were several famous performers from Beijing. The leader of the group was Zhao Xiaolan. The troupe, in addition to Zhao and her daughter, consisted of fourteen people, with the list as follows:</p>
<p>Leader: Zhao Xiaolan</p>
<p>Performers: Li Yutai, Yu Lianxian,</p>
<p>Tang Fushun, Sun Laishun,</p>
<p>Zhao Chunjin, Yao Shiqie,</p>
<p>Wang Tianfu, Zhao Rongting,</p>
<p>Chen Dachen, Qian Lin</p>
<p>Musicians: Zhang Liansheng, Song Wenming</p>
<p>Fang Xuanshan, Dong Fengnian</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Nanjing, Zhao Xiaolan and her entourage were "banqueted" by the "Propaganda Bureau of the Reformed Government." Zhao immediately sang during the banquet to add to the "grandeur." That evening, at the invitation of the "Greater People's Association," they broadcast on the "Nanjing Broadcasting" radio station, and it was decided that they would perform at the Central Stage for three nights, starting on the evening of the third day. Prior to this, the "Reformed Government" requested special permission from the Japanese military press department to invite "important officials" from both China and Japan to "appreciate" the performances. On the fourth and fifth days, the "Greater People's Association" would host the performances, offering free admission to citizens from all walks of life. The selected repertoire included "Hongluanxi," "Baihuating," "Chunqiu Pei," "Nü Qijie," "Yutangchun," and "Hongni Guan."</p>
<p>As for Zhao's trip south, her motivation was solely an invitation from the puppets, definitely not for commercial purposes. There was no so-called performance fee. The intermediary contact was Zhang Qingsheng of the "Guidance Department of the New People's Association" in Beijing, who was acting on the orders of his master, the military press department. The "remuneration" for the entire troupe was said to be five thousand gold pieces. With this paltry sum, the famous female performer was blinded by greed, which is also a major event in the performing arts world this year!</p>
<h3 id="e171">Rare News from the Kunqu Opera World <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Man Fu</p>
<p>Gu Chuanjie to Marry This Month</p>
<p>The famous Kunqu Opera performer Gu Chuanjie, whose real name is Gu Zhicheng, learned his craft at the "Yi Xin Yue Fu" Kunqu Opera Training Institute. Because all students at the training institute had "Chuan" in their name, Gu, who played elegant young men, was known as "Gu Chuanjie," enjoying fame alongside Zhu Chuanming and Zhang Chuanfang. From "Yi Xin Yue Fu" to "Xian Ni She," those who loved Kunqu Opera had a deep impression of Gu's acting. Later, he suddenly abandoned acting and pursued an official career, studying at Soochow University and Guanghua University's affiliated middle schools in Suzhou. He then went to Nanjing Jinling University to study agriculture. After graduating, he worked in rural areas in Zhenjiang for a while. After the war, he finally came to Shanghai. Occasionally, at the request of friends, he returned to the stage, but only as a guest performer. Through the introduction of Yan Weiyu and Hu Shanyuan, the editor of this newspaper's "Zi Shan Tan," he became engaged to the famous Kunqu Opera amateur Zhang Yuanhe (the granddaughter of Zhang Shushen, the former Qing Dynasty Governor of Suzhou) on February 3rd at the Zhongshe. Yesterday, joyous news came that Gu and Zhang's happy event was near, and they are scheduled to marry on the 21st of this month at the Atlantic Restaurant on the Fourth Road, celebrating their marital bliss. "Lan Huamei" (Lazy Eyebrows) will happily "Bang Zhuangtai" (Adorn the Dressing Table), "Neng Feng Chengxiang" (Auspicious Phoenix), "Jiaqi" (Happy Marriage), "Dai Chan" (Expecting a Child), and "Yu Qilin" (Jade Kylin). It is said that the members of the Xian Ni She will organize a Beijing Opera and Kunqu Opera performance that day.</p>
<p>Xian Ni She Finds a Venue</p>
<p>Since Xian Ni She Kunqu Opera performed at the Oriental Hotel last year, it has been praised by Kunqu Opera lovers. Later, due to the expiration of the contract, they moved to the Xian Le Grand Theater in western Shanghai. Recently, their performances were interrupted due to scheduling issues. The person in charge of the troupe has now successfully negotiated with the Great China Bookstore attached to the Great China Hotel on Fuzhou Road, and a contract has been signed. They will soon be able to perform on stage, with two shows a day and night. This is specially noted to inform those who love Kunqu Opera.</p>

<p>— Qin Tian</p>
<p>Wang Yuanlong's directed film "Yanzi Li San" has now been renamed "Yanzi Thief" and will be next on the set after "Three-Volume Incarnation Girl."</p>
<p>The film adaptation of "Wang Zhaojun" was originally proposed by Xinhua Company long ago, and Li Minghui was designated as the lead actress at that time. Now that it is about to be produced, the lead actress has been changed to Chen Yanyan.</p>
<p>The Yi Hua Company's "Chu Overlord" has been a huge box office success in Hong Kong. It is said that recently there are still four theaters showing it simultaneously, with each theater selling over a thousand yuan worth of tickets every day.</p>
<p>Diao Banhua, who has been away from the silver screen for a long time, will soon shoot a new film, "Four Demon Kings."</p>
<p>The first shot of "Mysterious Lady" is an audition for a flower vase, and the first shot of "Three-Volume Incarnation Girl" is a pair of live treasures—Han Langen and Guan Hongda bedridden.</p>
<p>Chen Kangran has decided to direct "Women's Apartment" after "Film City Notes."</p>
<p>The famous amateur performer Wang Huigu recently made a guest appearance as Su Qiu in "Mysterious Lady." Her initial screen test was surprisingly successful. It is said that if she is not a genius, how could she achieve this? It is hoped that she will do well.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the article about the relief effort mistakenly stated that it was initiated by the International Red Cross. It was actually initiated by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Trade Association.</p>
<p>The statement that Huang Guiqiu will perform at the Huangjin Grand Theater is incorrect, according to a statement from the theater.</p>

<p>In the Yiyou Cup Championship, sponsored by the Yiyou Society, the Yiyou team and the Puying team played their final match the night before last. The Puying team, riding high on their previous victories, fought bravely. The Yiyou team, facing a formidable opponent, also calmly fought back. The match was full of exciting moments, attracting a large and surprised audience. The fierce battle between Huang Jingen and He Xiaojie was the most intense. Unfortunately, the Yiyou team was weakened by the absence of their general, Chuan Gaoshun, and ultimately lost by a score of 9 to 19. The Puying team thus won the first Yiyou Cup championship. Following the Puying chess team, the Hualian and Chunfeng chess teams have successively invited Xue Junwei Han as their honorary advisor.</p>
<p>The Yilin Chess Society played against the strong Hualian Chess Team, and the result was a draw, demonstrating their strength. Yesterday, they fought the Chunfeng Chess Team. The Yilin team used their B-team players to fight and unexpectedly won against Chunfeng by a score of sixteen to eight.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>A Strange Wind Helped Li Zhuangyuan During the Palace Examination</p>
<p>At this time, Li Pan remained unconscious. When he was called for the third time, even after shouting his name twice, he did not respond and continued to kneel in front of the hall in a daze. Until the third time he was called, two eunuchs suddenly supported him and led him away, as if he was dreaming, and he obtained the top spot in the imperial examination. But strangely, after Li Pan was shielded by the screens, he immediately wrote non-stop, completing the paper in an instant. When he submitted it, his writing was also the best. This was truly a strange wind that helped him.</p>
<p>When Li Pan was the chief examiner, the successful candidates under him, such as Nian Gengyao and Altai, all became high-ranking officials and prominent figures. When he celebrated his birthday in his later years, others wrote poems praising him, including the flattering line "Half of the officials are from your students," which shows his influence at the time. During the Yongzheng era, his close friend Li Wei rose to the position of prime minister, so the Li family's power in the early Qing Dynasty was astonishing. Li Houji, who served as the governor of Fujian after the Republic, was a direct descendant of Li Wei. From Mr. Li Xiangyang to the present, the Li family can be considered a prominent family for three generations: Ming, Qing, and Republican. Back then, Mr. Xiangyang was certain to become the top candidate, but he declined. However, in his third generation, not only did another top candidate emerge, but also a prime minister. If Mr. Li had not been famous throughout the world and his personality and knowledge were universally respected, the Manchu slaves would never have so favored his descendants. In the past, during the imperial examination era, the three generations of the examinee had to be presented first. The Qing court, awed by Mr. Xiangyang's great name, knowing that he was a man of integrity and good family education, reluctantly appointed Li Pan as the top candidate. However, I feel sorry for Li Pan because he did not inherit his grandfather's great ambition and did not use his position and prestige at the time to rally the patriots who wanted to restore the Ming Dynasty, in order to complete the unfinished great cause of Mr. Xiangyang. He missed a great opportunity. Moreover, at that time, it could be said that eighty or ninety percent of the Manchu slaves' military and political power was in his hands. As I said before, "Nian Gengyao's teacher" was extremely rare in ancient and modern times. If Li Pan could have explained the righteousness and the ambition of expelling the Manchus and restoring the Ming Dynasty, I think that General Nian, who was born in the revolutionary Guangdong Guangning County, would have been moved by it. At that time, he held hundreds of thousands of troops, and the political power was also in the hands of Li Pan's cousin Li Wei. After a prime minister and a commander-in-chief both agreed, Li Pan could raise the banner of his grandfather Xiangyang, and it would probably only take a moment to drive the Manchu slaves out of the country. Unfortunately, Li Zhuangyuan did not think of this and was just like the bureaucrats with individualism, enjoying his life and considering it done. In this way, even though he became the top candidate, I think Mr. Xiangyang would have been filled with regret in the afterlife.</p>
