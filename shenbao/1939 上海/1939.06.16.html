<h3 id="c2">天津變局閃英國 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>「我英國政府，何時可以振作英國威望歟」？</p>
<p>此英國議員彭斯密司氏昨日在國會，質問英國當局之辭也。我人遠距英倫萬里，不獲身臨其境；然在紳士國家之中，模範議政之地，舉世矚目之時，莊嚴空氣之下，竟此問；何難想見問者之情緖如何抑鬱，如何惶惑，如何血脈僨張，如何聲淚俱下。此在英國人乃至英國之友人，凡愛英國者，殆無不如是憂疑，無不同情於此一問。當時代表政府出席國會者，外務决官勃特勒氏，嘿然無以報之。嗚呼，靜默霎那，是何景象？是何朕兆？謂非大英帝國沒落之前夕，斯黯澹凄凉若此歟？謂非大英帝國盪垢滌汚，奮發爲雄之前夕，斯沉着肅穆若此歟？此豈感情用事之所談，神經過敏之所見，愛英國者固懷抱憂疑，嫉英國者亦冷觀機運；不聞德國海通社十四日倫敦電報所傳乎？彼述天津變局，謂「大不列顚帝國之威望如何，即於此事之成敗卜之；」謂彼德人對今日之英國，乃於其徬徨苦悶而椰揄之，刺激之，喚醒之，以促英國對日强硬，是必無之理，必無之事也。愛之者，嫉之者，異口同聲作如是說，如是觀，蓋猶天籟也，必眞理也。</p>
<p>天津變局，莫得而逆覩其結果，茲在演進之中，至記者握管時爲止，非但絕無趨嚮緩和之端倪，且傳日本於實行封鎖英法粗界之餘，且準備以日僑五萬人，後備兵二千人，以掃墓爲由，整隊入英租界；彼邦朝野所示意，意義允過之。如彼軍部發言人曰，要求英國承認日本所擬創建之束亞新秩序。彼外務省發言人曰，須英國保證不再干涉日本之遠東政策。彼報紙論調曰，外人在華租界業已證實其爲日本建立東亞新秩序之最大障碍，故應全部撒廢之。凡是云，我人不必析言其涵義，不必闡明其影響，雖在下愚，亦得就其言辭，直接理解其願望；我人僅欲爲贅一言者，此皆數日來各國通訉社發自東京之報道，必遍載昨今世界各報，蓋確訉也。故曰非但絕無緩和端倪，日趨嚴重乃至於極端，是意中事。</p>
<p>世界輿情，各國朝野，除蘇聯方面未聞絲毫反應之外，罔不爲津局表示焦慮；亦有故示矜持，微露樂觀者，反而在英國。彼於日本公然提示之欲念，以及仲裁辦法之拒絕，皆視若無覩；而曰，事得由外交途徑解決也；又曰，日本不願在遠東引起新糾紛，英國方努力於應付歐洲事件，故亦願避免糾紛云。作此說者，姑不必疑其報之資本何自，其人之血統何屬，亦不必稱其雅量逾恒，要不足以代表英國輿情，更未可視此爲事實上乃有緩和端倪。蓋據昨日倫敦方面之最後消息，英國政府固已因津變而擬議及於對日實施經濟報復焉，對華加强實力援助焉，邀的美法聯合行動焉，議員奔走，當局緊張；其事其人，詳如本日報端所載，確乎其有山雨欲來風滿樓之概矣。循是推進，東海之濱或且不免需要一時之慘痛犧牲，然有關遠東之各種現行條約必因此保全，相持二年之戰事必因此較易結束，國際公道與人類正氣必因此復蘇，而英國之威望允必因此而復其萬丈光輝。</p>
<p>雖然，所傳英國政府之所擬議者如彼，循是推進之必然成效如此，事實結果殊未可知也；何也，行必效，而議未必行也。其間蓋有數魔：日本實行封鎖天津租界，特別示惠美僑，而美國孤立派企圖封鎖總統羅斯福；影響所及，使英國政策趦趄，勇氣損弱；此魔之在遠者一。英蘇兩國相需至殷，在歐陸然，在遠東亦然，由來既然，至津變而證明其允然；然英國聯蘇，懷有患得患失之鬼胎；蘇聯對英，以傲岸執抝自喜；於是最足贊助遠東趨於穩定之因素，爲雙方鬥法而湮沒；此魔之在近者二。英國昨今宣傳對日之各種擬議，若能實施，必奏實效；但英人之傳統觀念，以爲即此說說，已足使日本知所忌憚，故不以實施爲必要之行動，而以宣傳爲有效之法門；蓋英人雖爲世界最尙實際之民族，雖鄙薄徒說不行之政治家與宣傳家，然彼爲傳統之自尊心所蔽，估量自已太高，輒以所作宣傳乃因具有實力後盾而不同凡響，聞者必知忌憚，忌憚即是收效；詎知整個日本所以估量英國者，不若英國自估之高，而日本當權之軍人所以估量英國者，又不若日本穩健派估量英國之高；因此懸殊，英國所欲收效於「擬議」者，日本以其爲擬議而視如無物，此爲自尊自蔽之英國傳統觀念所不能想像者也；此魔之在內者三。惟此三魔，遂使未來之事實如何結果，成爲不可預事捉摸之大謎。除魔慧劍，惟劍及屨及之行動！起聽候檢査、但爲日本軍官推出其站立之行列中、爲麥肯西君、渠於今晨隧英租界時、曾爲日本哨兵剝光衣服、其後復返英租界時、曾被日哨兵推阻、不令前行、因站立是處達四小時之久、直至走至其他出入口處時、始獲通過、擄霍華斯君、英人不論男女、常爲刁難、日哨兵對英人之態度、日見惡化、英人中被剝光衣服者、爲數不少、此間租界英人得悉許多英人曾爲日哨兵剝光衣服之事、皆極爲憤慨、今日七哨兵綫處之擁擠情形較昨日爲允甚、唯蔬菜船准泊英租界河岸後、蔬菜問題、已較昨日進步、（十五日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據此間今日所接日方消息、日人的五萬人、現籌備於今日以和平方法侵佔天津英租界、此輩爲天津日僑、已決計省視庚子一役陣亡日兵之墳墓、星期六日並將有日方後備兵二千人集隊游行於英租界、往省日兵墳墓云、擄日報消息、天津日租界中國界興英法租界間之往來火車輛、因日方之限制、已減至尋常五分之一、尋常每日入英法租界工作之華人約有十萬人、但昨日午時止得入租界者不足二千人、天津日人以擴音機宣稱、檢查行人手續、不能迅速、殊爲抱歉、惟此乃不能免者、因欲取締以英租界爲根據地之共黨也、（十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>英法報紙　一致抨擊</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於日本封鎖天津英法兩租界事、此問各報、一致要求採取强硬行動、惟「金融新聞」則謂、對日實施經濟制裁、頗爲困難、言下有促當局愼重將事之意、「曼哲斯脫保衛報」仍謂妥協有望、日本或不致反對英國所提出之仲裁辦法、「金融泰晤士報一、則認爲天津局勢、甚爲嚴重、「日本封鎖天津英租界之結果、英國已有採取經齊報復辦法之必要、商務部正自經濟的商業的立塲、加以考慮、倘若日本一意孤行、堅持成見、則英國必將採行兩種報復辦法、（一）大規模之經濟報復（二）廢止英日商務協定、取銷日貨在英帝國市塲中之優惠待遇、英國政府對於此事、極爲重視、現正與法國美國政府保持密切接觸、此外「每日快報」載稱、「日方對華作戰、旣未獲有利益、又無榮譽可言、此决之事、顯欲在外交上取獲勝利以掩飾其軍事之失敗、」（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國報紙今日繼續評論日本封鎖天津英法租界事、茲節錄倫敦三報言論於後、以見英國之一般與情、每日捷報稱、日本對華作戰、實惠與榮譽兩無所獲、今乃希望以外交勝利掩蓋其軍事失敗、天津事件引起吾人在華租界之整個問題、吾人固應準備交還租界、但吾人須將租界交與中國人、而非日本人、吾人可對地主讓退、但不能對竊賊退云每日民聲報稱、日本不過以刺程案中四華人爲藉口、以造成一種事件、俾用以摧毀遠東英人利益、而抹倒英人威嚴而已云、金融新聞稱天津英租界今被封鎖矣、英國準備保護其遠東利益至何程度之整個問題、乃隨之而起、關於經濟範圍內行動之困難、似不可逃免者、英國須得印度澳洲與美國之合作、惟經濟制裁終須以武力爲援、過去八年中、吾人應付日本侵略之政策、似示人英國猶欲希冀僅以拖延手段解決此問題、但日本今日似强迫吾人作一決定矣、吾人惟有準備保持其帝國與商業之長航綫、否則必須縮短之、舍此而外、未有第三途徑也、（十五日路透社）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國報紙咸以日本在天津之倐然行動與英外部代表史德隆之抵莫斯科同時發生、認爲含有重大意義、時代報載右派議員葛禮科斯之言論、據謂渠對此巧合、深有所感、以爲德義旣不能獲取日本海軍在地中海合作之依允、乃壓迫日本至少在歐洲談判中吃緊時期、作一打擊云、菲迦羅報謂日本在天津之行動、殆有四種動機、（一）在史德隆赴莫斯科時、以威脅加諸英國、（二）英法蘇公的雖與日本無關、然日本以天津行動爲三國公的之答復、（三）對德唆使之服從、（四）轉移國人對於中國戰事之注意云、人道報稱日政府爲軸心國工作、欲以恐怖與威脅手段阻止和平陣綫之實現云、工作報載塔布衣夫人之言論謂如英國堅不讓步、則天津租界封鎖事、在渠觀之、無須過於重視、蓋日本不過藉此以試騐英國之力量、俾在上海有所行動耳、（十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>本埠字林西報昨載社論、論天津封鎖事略云、東京顯已覺悟對華戰事之結束、甚至在今日、其渺茫與戰事初起之時殆相同、且以爲尙須經過兩三年、始能擊破中國之抗戰力、同時日軍部之地位、已甚形窘困、故不得不有所動作、以示戰中喪失之生命與金錢、並非擲諸虛牝、以故乃於在華之外國租界中吶喊而作越軋之舉、藉以轉移日本民衆之注意、而使彼等不再集中其注意力於壯觀之戰爭、歷時已久、而日軍在華之前途、仍有長久可怖之爲鬭日軍雖戰至今日、能吾由此獲得其開始發動此種甚慘烈的冒險行動時所望之勝利、仍無把握之事實也、</p>

<p>騰漲情形　至足驚人</p>
<p>戰後無淪農產品工業品礦產品多趨上漲、（一）晨產品騰漲百分之一百以上者凡三、茶葉。五掊子·烟葉·百分之五十以上者凡五、桐油·紅糧·生絲·木料·苞米、百分之三十以上者凡四、棉花·花生油·芝蔴·黃牛皮、百分之二十六以下者凡八、西貢米·白粳米·小麥·黃豆·乾繭·猪鬃·食鹽·生油·（二）工業品如麵粉·棉紗·布疋·綢緞·紙·五金·水泥·顏料·及化學原料等、乃無一不趨上漲、允以進口貨之顏料·化學原料·五金·報紙·漲勢爲盛、棉紗布疋漲勢亦不弱、原因一爲外洋運費增加、二爲黑市外滙緊縮、以致成本隨之而貴、（三）鑛產品其應用廣而比較重要者、如煤·鑛物油·銅·鐵·鍋·鉛銻、等、其中煤漲百分之一百以上、蓋煤爲工業及家庭日用必需品、油因黑市外滙緊縮、價格飛漲、其他鑛產品因運輸關係亦相繼飛漲約百分之三十至五十之間、</p>
<p>各廠商又　改訂新價</p>
<p>滬市各業因外滙緊縮、原料飛漲紛紛通告提高售價、昨日又有各廠商繼起改訂新價、計爲（一）上海啤酒公司、（二）怡和啤酒公司、（三）梅林罐頭食品公司、（四）丁滋記鷹牌磁墨、（五）大豐皮革廠、（六）鑑臣洋行皮革部、（七）白姑娘香粉、（八）標永安堂萬金油等、（九）王和興拉練廠、（十）博士自來水筆、（十一）關勒銘自來水筆公司、（十二）上海鐵絲廠（十三）普爾實業社、（十四）中國化學工業社、（十五）中華錫紙廠（十六）慈豐車料工廠（十七）熱水瓶同業公會所屬各廠（十八）呢絨業同業公會所屬各商號、（十九）華盛綫廠等、查一般無關外滙各業、亦竟乘機高抬、若不迅予遏止、則一般平民苦力之生活、將不堪設想、而其影響於社會公眾之安寗者、實至深且鉅、有力團體其共謀有效處置、</p>
<p>商人操縱　威脅平民</p>
<p>上海黑市塲外滙、自本月七日起、因外滙平華基金委員會調整、及匯豐等銀行限制供給、以致英滙自八便士二五縮至六便士半、進口貨物成本高漲、紛紛提高售價、計有搪瓷·皮革·熱水瓶·顏料·煤球·鐵絲·玻璃·油漆·錫紙·西藥·化妝品·橡皮·肥皂·釘子·啤酒·出租汽車。洋紙·呢羢·布疋·紗綫·香烟·油墨·五金·機器·煤·油臘·等、惟與外滙緊縮無關之生絲·國米·雜糧·以及國產食品、亦隨之提高價格、但其中難免有投機商人企圖厚利操縱情事、允以國米之上漲與民國二十六年冬季、戰事初起時之價格相差不遠、且上海存米尚稱充足實無飛漲之理由、顯係投機商人之操縱、若不設法制止、勢必影響民食甚鉅、</p>
<p>工人生活　逐步困難</p>
<p>各物畸形上漲、以致生活費提高、影響民生匪淺、茲錄工人生活費指數如下、例如一九二穴年指數爲百分基數、則一九三八年食物百分之一二九·四七、房租百分之二八九·一四、衣服百分之一二六·五四、燃料及燈火百分之二四二·五九、雜項百分之一六四·二〇、總指數百分之一六〇，六二、上項指數爲一九二六年以來最高之數目、自此决物價騰漲後、更有鉅大之增高額、</p>
<p>各界紛紛　盼望平抑</p>
<p>國府爲穩定各地日用必需品之價格、及取締投機據縱、特頒佈非常時期評定物價及取締投機操縱辦法、由各地有關機關商會及經營日用必需品之同業公會、設立平價委員會、辦理當地日用必需品平價事宜、今全國各重要都市、均已相繼成立、惟上海方面、情形特殊、如果設立評價委會、則擬行取締之時、殊多困難、雖有人希望上海市商會會同各業公會負賣、評定日用必需品之價格、及取締投機者之操縱、但各業公會認爲事實上有困難之處、惟對於租界內之物價飛漲、期望公共租界及法租界當局、妥籌良策處理之、至與民食有關之數業、允應重視售價、以免影響市民生計、</p>

<p>自外匯平準委員會調整黑市塲外匯之後、以致上海黑市外滙驟然暴降、好事者造謠惑衆、投機者乘機活動、而淺識無定見之人、疑慮驚惶、人心浮動、市况動盪不定、今則外滙之供給漸豐、情勢轉躍、所異於者日者、暗市匯價緊縮而已、外傳平準委會基金已用罄之說、殆可因目前之繼續供給</p>

<p>國族利益</p>
<p>頗多抵觸之處惟爲</p>
<p>顧慮過去之歷史與環境之複雜、故上海猶容許其暗中爲廣大範圍之自由活動、而暗市得以存立、但代表中國法幣地位者非此暗市、因一先令二便士半之法定標準、中央銀行始終未變、即對於正當之外滙需要、始終照</p>
<p>法價供給</p>
<p>而維護此壁壘者、方策固多、允以貿易調整爲主要、政府之方針、爲維持友邦通商之利益、同時亦力求貿易之平衡、事實甚爲明顯、今未淪陷各關、均由入超而變成出超、貿易順遂、匯市自易維持、益以發行</p>
<p>政策愼重</p>
<p>物資與通貨之正常比</p>
<p>例、不因數量變化而或致破壞、再以原有之存金及新得之借款、而法幣之對外地位、均見堅固增强、但淪陷區域、因政府權力所不及、致入超激增、貿易逆化、益以「聯券」「華券」之套買、則</p>
<p>暗市匯率</p>
<p>軟化、乃屬勢所必然、處此環境、而苟以較高之匯率、由基金繼續供給、豈不徒增無謂之犧牲、故間接抑低黑市滙率、以矯正貿易狀態、或有因黑市匯價之减縮而憂物價昂騰、但須知此地所謂减縮者、乃指黑市而言、正當必需品之來自國外者、固仍按一先令二便士半照常供給、</p>

<p>好萊塢賭窟獲利殊鉅</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、外傳公共租界工部局得英美當局爲後盾、已非正式「表示滬西歹土」中各賭窟經營者須停閉賭塲、吾則置障礙物、完全堵絕其入公共租界之通道之說、各賭窟主甚爲關切、刻正嚴重考慮遷入內地、在無錫·嘉興·杭州與南京等地重行開業、然內地獲利、不若上海之厚、故似</p>
<p>不願遷徙</p>
<p>、聞好萊塢樂園於最近半載雖曾繳出鉅款如執照費·「保護」費·及「綏靖」費等等、然獲利已達四百萬元之鉅、該賭窟設有規模巨大之輪盤賭、故收益甚巨、各賭窟經營者、今在討論工部局採取更嚴峻手段之可能性、大多數賭窟雖可自「大道」區入內、但警務處可堵絕其通入租界之入口處、最後並可搜查來自「歹土」區之一切人等、使賭徒大感不便、因而不往賭窟、宵禁後乘汽車而未備通行證者、可　　押入捕房</p>
<p>拘禁、甚或對於備通行證而常出沒賭窟者、可收回其證、「歹土」賭窟主且信警務處尙能取其他若干方法、若切實厲行、則賭窟之繁榮營業、將一落千丈、而不能恢復、雅片館亦然、警務處搜查來自滬郊「雅片區」之人、即可摧毀雅片營業、而搜獲懷有雅片·紅丸等毒物者必甚夥、再、國際間斥責日軍侵略區中毒物狀况、使日本及其卵翼下之南京政權、</p>
<p>聲名大墜、故「維新政府」刻改革其「禁毒」政策、新「禁毒規則」不久將實行、規定烟館按照範圍等大小分成三等、第一等烟館中、每槍按日繳稅六角、二等五角、三等四角、較舊稅爲高、烟館經營者除繳官稅外、復須向地痞土棍繳「保護費、」以謀營業與運土之安全、「維新政府」允實行新條例、而肅淸「歹土」中之索詐者、但烟館方而頗疑惑此諾言之價値、深恐「維新政府」「綏靖歹土」時、將索更巨之捐稅、</p>
<p>並信此舉</p>
<p>不啻「殺產金蛋之鵝」、同時、土行方面亦深以「白紅敵人」爲懼、蓋海洛因與紅丸之暢銷、有害於「黑貨」營業也、表面上日人不准前往烟館與二等賭窟所在地之新康里與白利南路五角塲等地、但邇來日人前往該地吸毒賭博或觀光者、日見其多、</p>

<p>少婦投寓</p>
<p>新惠中旅舍、位於湖北路大新街漢口路口內部佈置雅潔、侍者服務週到、故一般中上階級樂於庽居營業殊爲鼎盛、前日（十三日）下午、有一摩登少婦（年近花信）至該旅舍、闢室四一二號房間、每日房金二元八角、當付國幣七元、旋即外出、比至傍晚七時許、始偕一男子同返、</p>

<p>初以倫敦大條、近期績縮〇六二五、遠期勿動紐約銀價呆定、倫敦生金回大一辦士、滙兌英對美小一釐九、對滬·對法均平、美對英降二五、對滬仍平、對法跌〇六二五、中央掛脾各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英滙六辦士牛、美滙十二元六二五、較之前收、英平美長〇三一二五、開後洋行與日銀行競相猛扒現貨英美兩金、無如中外各行賣意尙濃、致潛勢殊平、計洋行與日行（掮客轉）相繼扒進外行滙豐麥加利與華行上海現貨英金六辦士半、繼而又購結華比某行現貨美滙十二兀六二五、治滙豐掛牌揭曉、祗印匯掛縮一二五、其餘均未變更、及白銀平衡稅揭曉續大半分、計徽百分之四·五〇、時華僑售予同行七月份英金六辦士三七五、繼之日銀行（掮客轉代）塞予有利同月份英金亦六辦士三七五、後華行互做現貨美滙爲十二元六八七五、嗣後日行掮客轉又塞予麥加利七月份英金爲六辦士三七五、兼又吐於華比同月份美滙十二元四三七五、過程呈現平期硬之象、但不久即見回牛、將近午刻、外行賣予錢兌業現貨港滙爲四十三元半、爲狀亦稍帶硬、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英滙六辦士半、美滙十二元六五六二五、與晨開相同、</p>
<p>結果英平美微鬆</p>
<p>午</p>
<p>後洋行雖續來扒結、但因外行供意尙佳、且華行賣意愈濃、故市勢仍鮮變化、計洋行首先結進外行滙豐麥如利某行與華行中南上海現貨英金六辦士半、並又現貨美滙十二元六五穴二五、繼而華行互做七月份英金爲六辦士三七五、入後外行荷蘭賣予洋行現貨港匯四十三元半、狀况亦平、迨晚收銀行現貨賣價、英滙六辦士半、美滙爲十二元六二五、結果較之前收、英平美硬〇三一二五、港匯照成交價軋過、續鬆一二五、</p>
<p>香港匯市午後縮</p>
<p>香</p>
<p>港十五日電、今日滙市、晨開平穩、對美·對英·對日均無榮辱、申滙則回縮二元、爲二百二十七元、十一時三十分、尙無變動、惟上午收盤、市氣轉軟、英滙均縮〇三一二五、卽期爲一先令二便士八一二五、遠期爲一先令二便士七八一二五、美滙卽期縮一二五、爲二十八元八七五、遠期縮〇六二五、爲二十八元八一二五、日滙縮二五爲一〇五元七五、至下午收盤續吿緊縮、英匯又縮〇三一二五、美滙又縮〇六二五、日滙亦縮二五、</p>
<p>外幣堅俏者多</p>
<p>昨日英純金漲一辦士、英美滙兌降二五、本埠外滙、洋行結款甚殷、外銀行供給頗暢、港電供塞亦盛、結果英平美鬆零三一二五、烚赤開盤、做高八元、浮多趁高了結、市况稍軟、下午因英日形勢嚴重、錢兌業供塞、市價終回晚收二千五百八十五元、結果與上日同、外幣英美金鎊供求頗均、美金鎊需要較殷、價昂貴、英金票需要甚盛續堅、美金票因匯票鬆供給亦暢、價乃下游、法郞票需要稀、價稍回降、新加坡票·羅比票·坎拿大票等需要俱殷、供給未暢、多趨堅昂、日金票供給轉稀、市價已堅、晚市與法幣並價、朝鮮票反因需要稀而鬆、晚市爲八角四分二釐、公會交易尙盛、晋大出永泰進美金鎊一百個、惠通出永泰進美金鎊四十個、勤泰出輻康進英金票五十鎊、永豐出新泰進美金票一千元、寳祥出同豐進香港票三百元、昨日市價、英金票升二分、美金鎊升一角、美金蔡降一分三釐、法郞票降一釐、新加坡票升一分、羅比票坎拿大票斐律濱票俱升二分、德金票升一角、澳金票升三角一、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<p>貼現五十一元　拆息又達二角</p>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、忽見高昂、每干元上午由五十元〇二角半、步昂至近午爲五十一元、下午已趨平、比前日高七角半、錢業拆息亦復掛高至二角、比上日升起二分云、</p>
<h3 id="c55">證券　拆息日高　債市愈覺無力　洋股跌風可怖 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、陸續疲軟無力、浮多續有斬結、天津事件、流言又盛、前途或將接三元綫、再看環境之變化、拆息高至二角、透支利息須合一分二三厘、公債押款、金融界多數不願收受、小錢莊賣出現貨甚湧、大都套結外匯、爲利較厚、大戶正在逢小買進、已成尾大不掉之象、前途波動正多也、昨日情况、開盤價格經過甚平、卒以聯和潤利售出甚夥、七號裕濟順亨亦有賣出、價乃不支、步跌三四角、買戶方面有洽豐同順收進爲多、十三號協大同康等略有購進、午後人心半爲謠言所傷、繼續疲軟、丙種打破四元關、初甚不支繼以大戶拉抬稍稍回堅、如聯和順享潤利松茂續有吐出、市氣益萎、末以同順洽豐天生購進、與元鴻大亦尚有進胃、價稍抬高、惟市氣終係勉强、收盤後市氣仍弱、結果續一小四角半至六角、成交總數共計約一百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股</p>
<p>市證券交易所股票、成交一百股、價格爲念九元五角、</p>
<p>上海衆業公司報吿云、股市鑑於天津及鼓浪嶼形勢之不定、市上起多頭出籠了結之風波、故實業股受打擊、價格降跌特殊、茲將其受虧最厲者、列後、</p>
<p>收盤時似有吸胃、倘形勢仍有如此之緊張、則市上買戶欲行束手旁觀之策、橡皮股市影饗雖不甚大、但成交稀少、買價降低、而賣戶並不以此價而售出、是以多數股票、買價與賣價相差甚遠、難見成交、關於中國之發生事故、似信不能常影響及於楂華與馬來橡皮業之價値</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票、本月十四日（週三）掛牌行市、大體均吿平走、僅開平煤礦不記名股回跌六便士、價爲二十先令、</p>
<p>倫</p>
<p>敦中國外債本月十四日掛牌行市、趨勢盤旋、大致平穩、費克斯飛機借款債票跌一鎊、價爲十五鎊、道淸鐵路公債升半鎊、價爲十八鎊半、其餘均無變動、</p>

<h3 id="c56">糧食　天津租界封鎖　麺粉北銷停頓　漲風亦遭打擊 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>昨粉市漲風頓戢、緣天津租界被封後、水道亦遭阻斷、外輪儎貨退關之說、北洋帮客銷、大受打擊、客戶紛紛停辦、其他實銷亦均以價格過昂、進胃漸懈、成交銳减、備南洋帮添辦萬包左右、及本街內地零批約計萬餘包、二號粉仍爲四元八角、暫無變動、洋粉價亦趨平、聞北洋帮辦過燈籠牌數千包、價爲四元七角三分、本街成交蝙蝠牌等粉二三千包、價爲四元八角四分、市面環境、已不若前兩日之鋒俏矣、</p>
<p>小麥</p>
<p>昨市新小麥來源、續有零批抵埠、車麥船麥、併計不足千包、目下各產地價格昂貴、與申市售價頗難合劃、且實銷方面、華廠與日商均無正式去胃、是以貨方均擬上棧、以待善價而沽、致市塲供求兩寂、聞晚市有南京新麥成交二百餘包、價開六元四角、市面頗佳、亦係本街囤戶收進、</p>
<p>洋麥</p>
<p>有八千八百五十七噸半、內有巳裝袋者、裝儎怡和洋行經理之（Riley）號輪、今由澳洲運來、原定十四日抵滬、是日未能到埠、昨據該行云、該輪已有電吿、明日（十七日）當可扺埠、惟浦江內碼頭浮简均無隙地、故尚須在吳淞口外等候、約下星期二（二十日）方可進口起卸云、</p>
<p>來源漸多　米價午後回大</p>
<p>杜粳昨日各帮來源河下未到、車輪包子蘇同帮二千六七百包、平市開手尙有餘波、形勢續緊、嗣後本街及囤戶胃口轉懈、市色遂見軟勢、故結果市見平定、若常高仍開十九元四角、餘外各粳及薄稻悉在原盤左右、總之此種市面、飛騰太速、致人心反都懷疑、咸存歡望耳、</p>
<p>客秈昨市面暫吿平定、當晨間開市時、承數日來之漲風、貨主繼續喊高、而店囤廠作續有問津、價乃再漲一二角、旋以來源漸加、途貨亦將趕運來申、占利囤戶乃趁早求脫、店囤納胃頓呆、後市立小二角、而中次宿熱者反見修削近角、至北洋尖及埠尖、亦形相彷、</p>
<p>洋米存貨統在行囤手中、市上浮存早罄、故市面漸見混亂、當晨市各米續昂時、西貢米一度開至二十一元一二角、旋開二十一元、稍次二十元〇八角及二十元〇六角半不等、由店作及食戶辦去、後市以客秈回小、洋米亦見轉定、</p>

<p>蠶豆新豆自上市以來、因來源擁擠、行悄步修、但近兩日頭頭轉稀、致市稍見提升、昨汕頭帮續辦毛家市北港靑蠶豆一百五十包、價爲六元九角、行情比上日市趨砌一角、本街採去崇明大片白皮蠶豆五十包、價爲六元四角、又取嘉定白皮蠶豆五百餘包、價爲六元一角半、該豆因係威海帮回出、故售價沽小五分云、</p>
<p>黃豆自受直接間接之震盪以來、巳連漲一星期、至咋日各種實銷投機囤胃等交易勢轉退化、人心亦隨環境下挫、統市祇本街問津大連四平街豆三車、行情三起做開、爲九元三角半·九元二角八分·九元二角三分·昨之最低價、比上日之取高價已跌去一角七分矣、</p>
<p>出口豆子、今日有五十包、運往汕頭、又四百八十包、運往香港、</p>

<p>— 王百謙</p>
<p>皮鞋是最風行而普遍的一種履具，不但上層階級人穿著就是一般中等人甚至勞動者都有購買欲，最低限度的話也要在馬路邊的舊貨攤買一雙便宜貨，因此皮鞋業在無形中非常發展。</p>
<p>代進化，由平跟而進化為高跟，山圓頭而至尖頭，最近又新出了一種奶油皮底……等很多很多的樣式，確實是很合大眾的需要，不過奶油底……等高貴皮鞋楚上曆公子少爺小姐們的履具，他們是沒有一處不考究的，又因了老究之政，特地想出了－個以女子代巷他們來擦皮鞋，使他們的皮鞋沒有一時一刻不保持著光亮，這自然是公子少爺小姐們的幸福。</p>
<p>女于擦鞋公司一定設立在舞塲的附近，如跑為廳畔的「麗足女子擦鞋公司」內部裝璜極簡單，除了五六個女子以外</p>
<p>由需要而必求精因此皮鞋的花樣也隨簷時便沒有什麼，伊們的裝束很奇怪，好像一個半女舉生，又似女工模樣，逢到主客光顧的時候，很殷勤的招待上坐，伊就開始工作——鞋，伊們的擦鞋的確是富有經馳，每次的收費漆皮一角四分，香賓－角叫分，普通七分，擦白粉四分。全天的營業時光最忙的要算是華燈初上時候，因為許多紅綠男女們巳在磁動，他們為的是要織風頭，源源的向那裹跑進去，有應接不暇之勢，伊們的營業也戰於例外的，大約要夜半十一時打烊，正適合了狂遊者的口味。</p>

<p>蠶豆含蛋白質，多於食一米四倍，比之大麥亦一多一倍有奇，所含眼脈，則與一米麥相等，所含澱粉質，則比一米麥減少少十分，一三，故能耐饑而不生痰。如用發芽平去發帶水磨之成漿，於磚上暴乾，炒一香成粉，和入精　或糖，壓成方餅，可作點心，如供軍旅之用，足以療飢解渴，但須久嚼生律，然後分數口嚥下，則一方寸可抵一合米之飯，能耐四小時之飢。（鐵豆亦同，）如在避艱中以止小兒啼飢，宜由大人咀嚼成糊，喂以－指尖許之量，因其含有睡液，故易消化，不致脹懣，耐飢時間，能比麥面等一倍也。或雲　豆閉氣，係指煮食過飽者，一經炒香，則能下氣，但勿過量，宜於已飢方食，未飽先止，任何物品，皆如楚也。</p>
<p>蠶豆穀之全部及梗與葉含體物　甚多，浸＃可作肥料　花，極易長大，即含　之　質肥田粉也。暴幹德煙，能驅蚊蠅，其灰可用竹籮叫簧盛之，外套以缸，缸之下旁，擊一孔，高低排列為四　式，其下接以桶，注沸水於第一桶，則自漏下，經二三四而出，可扱去煎幹成塊，更以黑塊與木灰拌和，入灶肚中　之令變灰白色，重溶於水，則有機物　變為炭，可使沉澱過濾，取濾液煎加裏，市稱吉利　用途甚廣，可以洗濯油垢之衣。</p>
<h3 id="c73">評顧家宅公園 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 桌呆</p>
<p>要談顧家宅公園，先要曉得法國庭園的歷史。法國庭園的初期，是一位呌諾德爾的法國人，去向義大利學來的。義大利的庭園，都造在傾斜的山坡上，所以是　和階級為主體。法國的地形不同。都楚平原，於憂諾德爾氏學了義國的山上庭園設計法，改成平原型，這才是法國式。凡爾塞的名園，便是代表作，這就是諾德爾造成的。</p>
<p>義大利庭園在山上，所以眺望為主，伙國式麩把義國式化作平面的，所以也以眺望為主，利用著平地上一望無際的景象，有宏大壯麗之感；但這法國式，在面積大的地方雕佳，小規模的庭園，就嫌太單純了。於是就有一觀新跋國式庭園出現。</p>
<p>所謂義國式，沾國式，都他整形式，這新法國式，便加些自然式進去了。因此法國式庭園，就成混血兒，把諾德爾氏的端　華麗，做了近景，用自然風景做遠景了。現在所稱法國式的，是後者。</p>
<p>顧家宅公園，常然編於後者。平原式眺望的部分極多，如花壇，草地，池沼等等，此外，園路上的遮天大樹，和靠西面－帶的樹　，都是自然式的遠景。從這一些稱，卻是很純粹的新法國式了。</p>
<p>不過有幾處，還帶些東方色彩，這大約是環境關係。堆假山，是中國人拿手好戲，從造園藝術上講，竟沒有什麼價值，從享樂上講，呌遊園人　蝶　設，也沒有意思。顧家毛公園內，也有這些玩意兒，當然完全是適應環境，選石甚佳（因為不用太湖石），可惜堆得不高明。</p>
<p>池的中心，一個噴水，噴水下面，有一玻璃傘，內有照明裝置，晚上電燈一開，方知道玻璃是五彩的，紅紅綠綠，很引人注目。這一層，說不定也是迎合中國人的；不過太惡俗化了。</p>
<p>池中水面，浮著許多人造垃圾，這是一班　國沒有公德心的遊客的成績。</p>
<p>這一種類的庭園，春秋佳日，最為相宜，夏天宜早晚，在酷日之下，是無法利用的。冬天，要風和日暖之日才行。照法租界的面積和人口而論，這樣一個顧家宅公園，實在還不夠；不過退一步講：現在去玩的人，未必個個目的在休養，娛樂，欣賞，還有好許多醉翁之意的男女咧。</p>

<p>— 熙</p>
<p>後來經過德國素爾白朗男爵的研究，造成一析式車，第一次在德國曼息海姆出現，那是在一八一七年。後一年他把這車輸入倫敦，大眾見了，很佩服他的巧思，並贈以多稱名稱，最普通的一個名字，是　Ｄandyhorse（花花公子馬），這車和以前所製的有一主要不同點，那便是有一個裝在機軸上的前輪，可以操縱自如，這位男爵原望在倫敦大出風頭，但不久便被許多滑稽美術家和著作家恣意取笑，盡情挖苦，於是這花花公子馬只好溜之大吉，與這　倫敦長別了，但是至少有一位先生　，觸動他的腦筋，那但是住在蘇格蘭的麥克米蘭。他在花花公子馬上裝了一根曲柄，又用長　杆運動誓不罷休的凸部，結果腳踏便誕生於世。</p>
<p>麥克來蘭在一八三九年所成的車子，頗使當地人民嘖嘖稱奇，麥氏又常常請了許多賓客，在一個場上親自駕車表演，可是世人依然冷淡對之。直到後五十年藍那克外埠的達爾齊爾所成的第一輪真正腳踏車行駛於市，於是這變　車　BIEYELE才漸漸為世人注目，他便因此享了盛名。藍氏的新車是取麥克米蘭一八四六年式的車子做藍本的，在一八八九年那年麥氏的車子仍陳列在倫敦車子展覽會中，標明腳踏車原有的老式。數十年中，麥氏的車子曾經過幾度重要更變，一八六八年有人將踏板裝在前輪，代替麥氏的撥動踏板。一八七九年又有人將兩輪並列，駕車者坐在中間。一八七八年及恢復撥動踏板和後輪，但後輪比前輪要大兩倍。後來藍森氏的保安車出現，確能別開生面，但把手柄裝的太高，駕車者頗感不便。直至繼藍森氏者把坐位移在前輪之上，前輪的直徑為四尺六寸，於是駕車者便能突然隨意上下。而向任何方面前進。</p>
<p>一八八八年鄧錄浦發明了橡皮輪胎，因此得名發財。以前腳踏不過供一時尋樂之用，但者已漸漸增多，至是又把輪上的硬橡皮改用氣胎，於是腳踏車便風行於世。此後腳踏車的主要原則沒有什麼變化，一八七〇年曾開始用鋼絲輪，一八七七年曾開始用鋼珠，至於車子上的小的機械品，也費了許多人的腦力，經過若幹次的改良，才能達到今日的輕便　捷哩。（譯英文大美晚報）</p>

<h3 id="c76">一個譯者的意見 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>偶然翻翻圾近出版書籍的目錄，不禁注意到出版界方面一種可注意的現象：那翻譯的作品大有凌駕乎一般創作作品以上的趨勢。單就分量言，那麼寫作的東西無疑仍居多數，但就質量和對於讀者的號召能力言，譯品的東西在比例上確乎佔着壓倒的優勢。</p>
<p>拿上海的情形言，最近期內出版方面的最大功續之一，當推「魯迅全集」的出版。但同時在翻譯方面也出現了。「列寗全集」和全譯本的「資本論」，可是在新的創作方面，我們迄今爲止，還沒有見過十分有力量的作品（不論屬於那一方面性質的）。但在翻譯作品方面，却出現了相當多的足以號召一大部分讀者的東西。除前舉的「列寗集」，「資本論外，一年來出版的比較有名的譯作尙有「西行漫記」，「續西行漫記」，「日本向全世界挑戰」，「日本在中國的賭博」，「新一生的中國」，「日本的間諜」，「日軍在華暴行錄」，「紅前綫」，「蘇聯新憲法」：「中國爲自由的鬥爭」，「新中國印象記」以及最近出版的賽珍珠的「愛國者」，和隨「歐洲之內幕」後現正由一輩人在趕譯中的「亞洲之內」等等。而且在預吿中以及筆者個人所曉得有人在翻譯中的東西，更有一七八種之多。</p>
<p>翻譯界的這種「景氣」的現象，就好的一面言，則介紹外人的觀點思想，以作自國文化工作的一個借鑒，原是一件很可喜的現象。我們決不能夠嫌翻譯的東西太多國。其實比起我們的日本來，我們的介紹工作還是望塵莫及，雖然目前日本的情形，就介紹工作的質的方面言，是遠不及我們的。</p>
<p>但這里我們應該反省的是：何以外國的作者偏偏寫了如許關於最近中國問題的作品（或中日問題及遠東問題，而我們自國的作者却反沒有那樣的成績足以示人？一個外國記者來到中國觀察一二年後，回國就出版了關於中國問題的書，照理說，比外國記者有更多方便的中國記者，理應有更好的成蹟，可是實際上雖不能說絕對沒有，但有價値作品問世的，却是少數中的少數。</p>
<p>例如像「愛國者」那種小說，中國的文藝作者中決不是沒有人能够」寫。我個人甚至深信如果由一個巳有文學修養和技術的中國作家來處理同樣的題材，一定能比賽珍珠，寫出更好的東西。</p>
<p>然而迄目前爲止，我們還沒有發見有力量的新的創作。我個人是個從事翻譯工作的人。我的提出上面的問題，決不存心在責難創作家的失責。因爲我曉得目前的環境有種種困難。但我不得承認自己內心所常感到的痛苦。當我每决着手翻譯一本有關中國事件的好書的時候，我心裏不得不發生這樣一種感想。。何以這種好材料和好題材，不由我們自己的作家去處理組織，却待別人寫好了才再去翻過來。明明是自己的東西，却得用著人的名義。這種現象是太傷心了</p>
<p>翻譯工作是有其獨自存在的意義的，但一個有民族意識的翻譯者，他不希望專門去翻譯一些本可以由自國作者寫的東西，他的主要職責並不在此。但目前從事於翻譯的工作者，因客觀上的情形是如此，不得不暫時擱下介紹西方文化的責任，而將外國作者搜羅去的中國問題材料，重新物歸原主。</p>
<p>我這種見解也許太淺薄偏狹了，但却出於至善至純的動機。</p>

<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>因爲要硏究明代驅寇文人唐順之的生平，我特地去細讀了一下唐荆川集。荆川先生極推重邵康節先生的伊川擊壤集，於是又引起了我讀擊壤集的興趣。</p>
<p>涵芬樓秘笈本伊川擊壞集，一共四册，印得非常考究，紙張尤潔白可喜，學校裏藏這一類的書，大概除飽蠹魚以外，只有我輩不識時務的人借來偶爾看看罷了。</p>
<p>老實說，邵康節先生的詩，道學氣太重，多半說理，有些地方簡直全與偈語敎條等無異，詩的意味雖然也有，然沒有哲學意味的濃厚，可以說是一部徹頭徹尾的哲理詩集了。</p>
<p>說到哲理，還是讓馬一浮先生等在復性書院裏去說敎罷，我只能從擊壤集中摘錄幾句足以箴戒箇人的話來談談。</p>
<p>緣飾吟</p>

<p>土木偶人</p>
<p>土木偶人，愼無相笑！天將大雨，止可相弔。</p>
<p>目前沒有帳幕遮飾的傀傀太多了，「稱好手」「似眞家」，究竟是不是「好手」是不是「眞家」呢？也不過「據稱」和「形似」（像煞有介事）而已。</p>
<p>至於士木偶人，一時好像得意地在笑，可是天一降起大雨來，就只好「相弔」了。</p>
<p>東海有大魚</p>
<p>東海有大魚，網罟無能近，碭然一失水，螻蟻得而困。</p>
<p>這大魚指的是什麼，我想明眼人一見便知道。目前好像一切網罟都不能近它，等到它勢窮力蹙的時候，立刻就要變爲「涸轍之鮒」，死期逼近了。</p>
<p>又，康節先生在共「奢侈吟」中有云：「侈不可極，奢不可窮；極則有禍，窮則有凶。」在今日猶不免於奢侈习惯的我国人，似乎亟應以之為炯戒吧。</p>
<p>其「上下吟」中有云：「……自心觀物，何物能一、自物觀心，何心不均。」我以爲和「唯心論者說心支配物，唯物論者說物支配心」的說法一般。不知有人笑我是附會吾？</p>
<p>他對於書蠹極端反對，足見他並不是主張死讀書的人，有曝書吟一首爲證。</p>
<p>蟲蟗書害少，人發書害多。蟲蟗曝已去，人蟗當如何。</p>
<p>他對於詩的生張如下：</p>
<p>何故謂之詩？詩者言其志。既用言成章，遂道心中事。不止錬其辭，抑亦錬其意。錬辭得奇句，錬意得餗味。</p>
<p>——論詩吟</p>
<p>擊壞集有四册二十卷之多，可談的話太多，我所引的，只不過上面寥寥數十言而已，眞是所謂「任憑它弱水三千，我只取一瓢飲」也。</p>

<p>三</p>
<p>路旁的乞丐頗多，汚穢，殘廢，臭氣衝天。兩彭看了，都害怕，因爲他們在故鄉看到這種病狀很多。這大的是麻瘋之類的，但到了湖南，祇限於坐「癱子轎」的乞丐了。我不禁又迂闊地說：</p>
<p>『又談到歷史，麻瘋大的也是國粹。曾經看到一種醫學報紙，說孔夫子弟子伯牛得了「癩」病死掉，這所謂「癩」，就是麻瘋。以德行好的伯牛還得麻瘋，不好的，豈不要開天窗？』</p>
<p>廣東人看到的麻瘋人很多，可是很厭惡談到它。它是一種極可怕的東西，但到湖南來，祇限於坐「癱子轎」的呌化子，却有些奇怪。難道湖南人都是敗類？</p>
<p>再上去幾里，山路變陡。仍然有些悄况較好，看來像流亡農戶的人們，在有樹蔭泉水的地方，守著一頂小小三角形的稻草棚，好像一家人都生活在裹面。他們用「化緣册」央求着著長衫子的人們題上幾個字，化費一二十個銅子的小款。據路人說，他們有的從這些捐款的集成後，買一兩隻小猪，一道兒在稻草棚裏棲息，一道兒飮食，待肉胚長成，趕到南嶽市，就可變爲幾十百餘兀的小灘販子主人了。</p>
<p>半山的矮樹材間，有些採摘什麼的小僧人隱顯。由道旁所留下的筍籜上看，他們正在尋找大批的小竹筍，預備運回庵裹，用鐵臼碾成碎末，製作長齋用的餅。還有些拾藥材的本地商人，流着汗，在山巖間默默的工作。他們獲得了大量的生地，金銀花，當歸之類較貴重的藥村，似乎什麼艱苦也不辭了。可是，南嶽的藥，品質是很劣的；因爲山地瘠，氣候烈，藥生出來時時變了性。可是他們用這個，應付周團一兩百里的市塲，却有餘裕。</p>
<p>這些情形，從一個同路的老僧簡略的談話裏，約略知道的。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>我們看了一會兒地圖，尋到一道石級。的一里路的距離，來到一處很僻雅的地點——半雲菴。菴脚的山腰間，雲和炊烟一樣的綿延，輕輕蓋着山下面的嚴家，碧樹，禾田，糞塘，人和狗。</p>
<p>『這是一個値得留戀的地方，』大彭說。『我從來不是信那些國畫家的。現在可以從這裏證明「山半停雲」這回事不假。原來國畫家的藝術根本，也疏人尋找！』</p>
<p>菴了很蒼古，石級上，苔和呢氈一般厚密；三百年以上的樹，速依附在上面的籐都有一個世紀的進程了，龍蛇一般，吐露於半空間。房屋大的經過無數回修葺的，石塊上都刷了些粉。住持人由一僧一道分任着；僧人胖，道士瘦，活活地現出兩個類型的外像。</p>
<p>他們的生活带有營業性的。見了坐轎的乘客，必得捧出化緣冊子來；可是徒步的人們，一茶一飯，都必須經過索取。他們兩間正房都分賃給兩個軍官的眷屬了。一個是旅長太太，一個團長太太。她們都很樸素的生活着，好似連女工也不曾雇。</p>
<p>二彭是很富觀察力的；他在房門口逗留了一會，隨即走出來對我和大彭說：</p>
<p>『團長太太還像。那位旅長太太——噎……』</p>
<p>『也許，』大彭應着，『剛才和尙向我示意什麼，說不定連和尙……』半晌，吸了半截烟，他又說：</p>
<p>『老黎，你不妨用寫實派的看法，畫出古文明蓋着的現代材料。我願意做個小小批評家，至少證明你這作品沒有半偭字謊話。』</p>
<p>他們都笑。道士遠遠的走來，導着我們去看看附近二三十步的建築物——中國旅行社。</p>
<p>道士的陳述，我們知道這處所是早些日子張學良來南獄「幽放」的處所。現在是預備留下來給要人住的。我們看見門口有些公務人員坐着談天，還有一個負傷的飛機師，頭給裏了半邊，脚下撑着一支扶手杖。</p>
<p>道士說：「憇息一下，先生們！都是一家人，都是中國出生，奉着中國敎的……」</p>
<p>童子送上茶來，擺在石階上。大家都讓了一會兒座。我們開始接談個半晌。</p>

<p>— 湘候</p>
<p>這是在天津的英國人A，寫給上海的英國人B的一封信。B是我的朋友，承他允許，我得以將信中關於天津方面的一段，譯出發表。但他不肯將眞姓名宣佈，因此這裏只稱他們爲A·B。</p>
<p>在上海，空氣還比較新鮮，雖然我們已威覺到很窒息了；可是在天津，這古老的都市、祗有海河的濁浪，還能自由地翻騰。外國人的我，在這裹也不容易獲到像在中國其他地方的一般的優待。果然，這裹也有我們的租界，但情形比上海更壞十倍，租界裏也是海河樣的，汜濫着濁流。</p>
<p>初到這裹，甚於囚犯之到審判廳，盤詰極嚴，而且見過了「小鬼」，還得見「神明」——所謂小鬼「神明」，是天津流行的隱語，「神明指日本人，「小鬼」則不言可喻了。——先幾天，似乎我的行動，無時不在被監視中，後來，我特地往訪從前在哈爾濱認識的一位中國友人，他有一個不十分陌生的名字：「陶言心」（譯音），從前他曾一度被少年將軍張學良拘禁過的，現在却在這裏做敎育上的行政長官。數年不見，這位中年政客已蓄起納粹式的鬍子；我知道他過去的年歲都費在「善鄰」工作上，現在他似乎已部份能成功；可是他的地位無時不在如睡夢中幌動着。在北方的「小鬼」——恐怕不單在北方如此，一方面耍受多疑的「神明」的猜忌，另一方面要顧慮到在這土地裏生長着的兒女們的注意。</p>
<p>天津華人的最大的危險，是思想問題。「思想犯」在牢獄裏幾乎無法收容。因爲所謂思想犯者，含義至廣，有一位中國畫師，爲着在一個圓圈之下畫了一枝梅花，爲警察拘去。據畫師說：這圓圈是象徵月亮，中國人畫梅花大概都和月亮畫在一起，可是日本人說這圓圈是象徵太陽，而梅花乃是蔣政府所定的國花！</p>
<p>在這裏，日人於中國人之充當警察者，係以拘補他們的同胞之多寡，作爲陞遷的標準。因此天津的警察一天到晚以捕人為唯一職務，往往二個警察相遇時，互詢：「今兒淘着多少金沙？」金沙　成爲犯人的代名詞！可是，天津的警察往往在黑夜執行職務時，自己也變了他人的　金沙！</p>
<p>這臺，燃燒的事件特別多，而且起火的處所，大概都屬某方的產業，至於起火的原因，則連當事人也諱莫如深！</p>
<p>經濟的掠奪，在這裏說是巨細無遺，附上半分的一聯準券」一張（見銅圖），你於此可以看出他們的搜刮手段。</p>
<h3 id="c82">「人之初」觀感 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>「世界上沒有一個壞孩子！」看完了「人之初，」我又記起「孤兒樂園」中佛萊納根神父說的這句話。而敎育的力量。也終於像米蓋羅納那樣倔强，潑野的孩子也感化過來。「人之初」是寫巴黎郊外的一所女子感化院，這里面也同樣監囚着一羣年靑的犯罪的女孩子，可以院長愛甫爾，却眞像囚犯那樣去對待這羣女孩子，感化的工具是「鞭撻之刑」。</p>
<p>「世界上沒有一個壞孩子」一這羣無告的女孩子，只是犯了細微的過錯，才送到感化院來的。在他們純潔的心靈中，他們同樣酷愛着自由的空氣，可是在錯誤的感化方法之下，將激起相反的結果是必然的。藍妮瞥見了蘇珊和佐治的接吻，即以此要挾蘇珊竊取捲烟和酒精，而釀成大禍，這是壓力愈大，反抗力也愈大的必然的因果。這里更有鼓明顯的例子，就是無論管敎怎樣嚴厲，她們祇要有一個機會，會拾起地上的磚頭來敲毀感化院的規則。這樣使新來掌管院政的允溫妮看淸楚了「跋刑不足馴其性」。</p>
<p>再看看在合理感化方法之下的結果又如何呢？</p>
<p>這個倔强，野性的蘇珊，允溫妮釋放她到城中去購物，讓她有一個快樂的下午，院長愛甫兩自然反對這樣的方法，可是蘇珊終於在九點鐘之前回來了。</p>
<p>「世界上沒有一個壞孩子！」我們現在可以相信佛萊納根這句話。</p>
<p>同時，「人之初」在導演赫斯脫高超的手腕之下，每一個畫面，每一塲戲都處理得非常動人。</p>
<p>片子的開端，鏡頭從海闊天空移到狹窄的感化院的墻頭，配着愛甫爾暴戾的呼聲「二，一二，」才展開一羣女孩子在嚴密的監視下早操。蘇硎奉命入城去購物，她走出感化院的鐵門，她站在門外的陽光下，她彷彿連自己的存在都有些糢糊起來了；她臥在草地上的時候，看着天空成羣的飛鳥，雄壯的雲層的移動，麥浪的隨風盪漾，在這簡單的畫面上表示那些孩子們是怎樣渴慕着自由的天地。</p>
<p>後面雖然故事進展到蘇珊和佐治的戀愛上，但是這里有一塲戲是不能忽視的：藍妮要挾蘇珊偷竊酒精闖禍，可是當她知道蘇珊已得上峯早日宣誓出院的批准，她毅然把事實「和盤托出」；在蘇珊出院的時候，同伴又都互相歡送着她，這說明了藍妮等都已受了尤溫妮的感化，她們不再是壞孩子了。</p>
<p>所以說「人之初」中的羅曼期削弱了主題的力量，而感化的力量也祇一個蘇珊，我並不同意這看法。</p>
<p>尤溫妮的「犧牲本人胡幸福」，和佛萊納根的犧牲精神是同樣偉大的！</p>
<p>新人柯林柳夏的演技，確是亞力山大科達的慧眼識英雌，她從開始到終塲，從一個倔强，潑野日孩子感化過來，及私戀佐治，向允溫妮請罪，在適當的過程中，轉變不同的性格，沒有超過，也沒有不及、瑪蒂達赫脫的愛甫爾和愛娜裴絲泰的允溫妮也都成功。就是飾佐洽巴萊彭斯軟弱了一點。</p>

<p>這一次國泰胡節目，是以新聞片「馬奇諾防線」和正片「風流偉人」相提并論胡。這可以有兩種解釋，一種是一時代的進展」已到了滿大風雲的現階段，要想裝聾作啞已不可能，於是被稱爲最强動的國防綫之一的法國馬寄諾防綫，也就被推崇了起來；一種是「風流偉人」的主角的翰巴里摩亞，是個老去了的藝人」，人老珠黃不値錢，在當年雖是出過一番風頭，而現在，則就不得不以新聞片如馬奇諾防綫之類來帮忙作爲號召，這真不禁使人有「老去了的藝人呵」之嘆！</p>
<p>馬奇諾防綫的新聞片一共是二卷，當然，「事關軍事秘密『，它是不會使我們看到全豹的。不過以「馬奇諾防綫」和「風流偉人」兩者比較起來，那麼我要擇取的到還是「馬奇諾防錢。理由簡單得很，這張新聞片雖不够「藝術」，但却和我們所處的這現世界有切身之感，人是要能生存下去才能享受的，這就成爲我寗願歡喜它的緣故了，倒並不單是因爲充實了一點知識而已。</p>
<p>誠然馬奇諾防綫並不是咱們中國的「馬奇諾防綫」的新聞片，也祇是有一點示威性質而已。可是每個國家旣不能離羣而孤立，閉關以自守，中國在目今又正是重要脚色之一，這對於和平陣綫的盟友之一的法國國防，依現在看來，就不能不親切地覺得應該另眼相看了。固然這不是我們自已的，可是至少，它是我們的朋友的。</p>
<p>至於「風流偉人」，也許我本來是存着並不多大的希望去看的，所以倒也並不如何失望，而天倫間的融融之樂，則尤使人覺得人間的溫暖可愛，糊塗蟲的一步靑雲，固然是一根刺，可也不無使人有憑空跳出來之感。</p>
<p>約翰巴里摩亞的演技還是那樣的有舞台氣息，這些動作放在舞台上該是非常好看的吧，而通過了精細的「眼麥拉眼」以後，它却成爲火氣了。彼得荷爾登和佛琪尼蕙德拉是一對有前途的童角，特別是那個祗有七歲的彼得，好好培裁，他將米是不會輸給米蓋維納等的。</p>
<p>導演者不壞，特別是寫彼得和佛琪尼萊幾塲孩子戲，有獨到之處。</p>

<p>第十二回　紅粉殲仇難消孽障　綠窗談愛重締良緣</p>
<p>但他們以爲舞女終究是個舞女罷了，潘老老現在是個闊人了，位高金多，舞女的眼光中，嫁了他可以享用不盡。凌霄花却以爲不入虎穴，焉得虎了，不然，英俊少年，和她相愛好的也不少，爲什麼拒絕他們，而倒去跟了一個龍鍾老翁潘某，就是爲了心想復仇。爲了復仇之故，只要達到目的，便什麼都可以。所謂只求宗旨，不問手段，革命的人，往往如此。而且凌霄花的目的，還不僅在潘老老身上，她的目的是在潘老老之外以爲潘老老很接近她所痛恨的一班人，她在潘老老那裹，可以伺着機會，得達她復仇的目的。她的意思，凡是和她同志的團中人，都是明瞭的。她的犧牲色相，她的貢獻貞操，允其使團中人的哀憐她，敬重她，都願意帮助她。她雖然看了費宮人刺虎，心中有了刺激，但她並不以潘老老爲心目中的虎，她是別有一種心目中的虎。恰巧那一天的機會來了，她知道潘老老是請了一個人到家裏來，這個人便是凌霄花心目中的虎了。她的定了團中的兩位實行家，到那時懈行事，一切都布置好了，可以算得裏應外合。及至到了那時候，潘老老正在十分恭順的獻媚，却進來了兩個人，向他們砰砰幾響槍，結果，潘老老是完了，而凌霄化心目中的虎，只刺了一個半死。幸虧那兩個人從容而去，未遭捕獲。潘老老一死，凌霄化當然不能再在潘家存身，她還是去潛心想法她心目中的虎，不必細說。潘老老辛苦了幾年，負了一個賣國的惡名在身上，到頭來，送了他的天年。及至死了以後，佩英去搜查他的遺留下來的文件，發現了趙樂大最後寫給佩英的兩封信。始知她寫了那封回信去後，趙樂天還寫了信給她，却被父親所截留了。雖然我這樣的冷淡拒絕了他，他還是餘悄戀戀，就是責備我也出於誠意。又見第二封信上，說到一不久就可以聽到趙樂天爲國捐軀的消息、云云，而趕樂天眞個不久就爲國捐軀了。不要我這封冷淡拒絕他的信，給他受了刺激，與他的死有什麼關係嗎？（一三七）</p>

<p>— 志華</p>
<p>自初步智識至最高技術　情景逼眞宛如戰地風光</p>
<p>銀幕上的海陸武裝配備，普通不過求情景逼眞，滿足觀眾慾望。惟照美國陸軍部近來的辦法，已確實用在國防上面，計劃在世界大戰爆發時，利用電影技術，迅速動員全國志願軍，出奇制勝。此種影片名為「陸軍訓練速成」，表演當兵與作戰種種必要技術，已製就四十二片。內容自初步知識，即在軍用地圖上分度量角起，至最高的技術，開一五五米釐海岸大砲止，所有事物，都是眞景實物，一般民眾觀賞之後，對於軍事學識，即可充分知悉。</p>
<p>陸軍參謀部所以不惜大規模的如此做法，理由是現代的軍事學識，一日千里，若在平時沒有系統的訓練，戰時難以超越敵人，前數年已派員在好萊塢研究攝影，並請各影商合作，近來積極推行。他們的演員撥調練就的軍隊充之，其背景有山岳，湖沼，平原，街巷，各視題材而定。拍成之片，如書本然，有章回篇目。如第一章名曰「步兵衝和、鋒須知」叙步兵一隊，匍伏向前挺進，不使敵人覺得察，至要塞附近，實行掘壕，迅速佔領之，並進而實行向敵火攻等技術。第二章曰「死守據點條件」，申述如何以密集砲火應付坦克，開機關槍，佈置電綱等，每一步驟，都用慢動作表演，緊要處特別放大，並用箭頭指示。</p>
<p>此種影片與普通不同之點，是不攙雜玄想或噱頭，或不必要的刺激，以免失眞。它把作戰步驟嚴肅的描摹出來。甚至槍砲的聲音都是眞的，遠近地雷的爆裂，亦用曲綫圖解，由慢動作表示出來。射擊至精彩處，並有長官喝彩聲，如曰「好槍」「好傢伙」「妙啊」，提起觀眾的精神。每片歷時約半句鐘，每年可製三十套。目下側重於烟幕戰，野戰砲應用，軍用信號施放，步兵渡河，騎兵衝鋒，肉搏戰發微，機械化部隊運動，傷兵急救等。故戰事一日爆發，銀幕前的觀眾，可立刻變為戰塲上的　士。</p>

<p>閧傳已久之阿Q正傳，為話劇界義賣公演預定計劃中最偉大的一劇；原由工華，保聯，精武，益友，四劇團聯合演出，日期定六月十五日左右，但是最近又宣吿延期，記者乃向四劇團負責人探聽，茲得延期原因如下：</p>
<p>一，塲地不能解決，因為各戲院平日自己都有戲做，而這次義演出的日期更須十天，所以都不願將日夜兩塲讓出來。</p>
<p>二，保聯從中退出，理由是沒有相當空餘時間。</p>
<p>這樣一來，阿Q正傳幾乎發生流產的危險。直至日昨由劇務委員會召集各劇團負責人詳議辦法，經過周密的考慮後，決定租借黃金大戲院，演期改定於七月二十二日至三十日之間。至於阿Q正傳決由工華，益友，精武三劇團繼續努力；星期一至六正在不停地排練；憑着這種苦幹，硬幹的精神，我想這次一定不會再與熟望阿Q正傳的諸君失望了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Tianjin Situation Troubles England <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>"When can the British government reinvigorate Britain's prestige?"</p>
<p>This was the question posed yesterday in Parliament by British Member of Parliament Mr. Ponsonby, addressed to the British authorities. We, residing tens of thousands of miles away from England, are unable to witness the scene firsthand; yet, in a nation of gentlemen, a model of parliamentary governance, at a time when the world watches with bated breath, under an atmosphere of solemnity, such a question was raised. How difficult is it to imagine the speaker's emotions: how depressed, how perplexed, how blood-stirring, how tearful? This is the sentiment shared by almost all Englishmen, and even friends of England, all who love England; they are filled with such doubt and worry, and all sympathize with this question. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, representing the government, remained silent and unable to respond. Alas, what a scene of momentary silence! What a portent! Can it be said that this is not the eve of the decline of the British Empire, such darkness and desolation? Can it be said that this is not the eve of the British Empire cleansing its filth and striving to be great again, such composure and solemnity? This is not a matter for emotional arguments or hypersensitive perceptions; those who love England harbor anxieties, and those who envy England coldly observe the opportunities. Have you not heard the London dispatch from the German Transocean News Agency on the 14th? In describing the Tianjin situation, it stated, "The prestige of the Great British Empire, its success or failure, will be judged by this event." It stated that Germans today regard Britain with mockery and gloating in its bewilderment and distress, without intending to provoke or awaken it to urge Britain to take a firm stance against Japan. This is absolutely impossible and will never happen. Those who love it and those who envy it speak and see alike, as if it were the voice of nature, and thus must be the truth.</p>
<p>The outcome of the Tianjin situation is yet to be seen, currently unfolding. As of the time the reporter takes up his pen, there is not only no sign of easing tensions, but it is also reported that Japan, after implementing a blockade of the British and French concessions, is preparing to have 50,000 Japanese residents and 2,000 reservists, under the pretext of visiting graves, march into the British concession. The intentions demonstrated by the Japanese government and public far exceed this. For example, a military spokesman stated that they demand Britain recognize the new order in East Asia proposed by Japan. A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that Britain must guarantee not to interfere in Japan's Far East policy. Newspaper editorials stated that foreign concessions in China have proven to be the greatest obstacle to Japan's establishment of a new East Asian order, and therefore should be abolished entirely. All of this means that we do not need to analyze its implications or explain its impact. Even the most foolish can directly understand their desires from their words. I only wish to add that these are all reports from Tokyo by various news agencies in recent days and must be widely published in newspapers worldwide today and yesterday, as they are confirmed news. Therefore, it is said that not only is there no sign of easing, but the situation is becoming increasingly serious, even extreme; this is to be expected.</p>
<p>The world's public opinion and governments, except for the Soviet Union, which has shown no reaction, all express concern about the Tianjin situation. Some deliberately feign composure and subtly express optimism, but these are mainly in England. They turn a blind eye to Japan's openly stated desires and rejection of arbitration methods, saying that the matter can be resolved through diplomatic channels. They also say that Japan does not want to create new disputes in the Far East, and Britain is focusing on dealing with European events, so it also wants to avoid disputes. Regardless of the source of funding for those who make such statements or their ethnicity, and without praising their extraordinary tolerance, they are insufficient to represent British public opinion, and it is even more impossible to see this as evidence that there is a trend toward easing. According to the latest news from London yesterday, the British government has indeed considered economic retaliation against Japan due to the Tianjin situation, strengthening practical assistance to China, and inviting joint action from the United States and France. Members of Parliament are rushing about, and the authorities are tense. The details of the events and people are described in today's newspapers, truly giving the impression that a storm is brewing. If this continues, the coast of the East Sea may face temporary and painful sacrifices, but the existing treaties related to the Far East will be preserved, the two-year war will be easier to end, international justice and human righteousness will be restored, and Britain's prestige will surely regain its former glory.</p>
<p>However, although the British government's proposed actions are as such, and the inevitable effects of pursuing them are as such, the actual outcome remains unknown. Why? Because action must have its effect, but plans may not be carried out. There are several demons at play: Japan implements a blockade of the Tianjin concessions, specially showing favor to American residents, while isolationists in America attempt to blockade President Roosevelt. The impact of this causes British policy to falter and courage to weaken. This is one distant demon. The urgent need for cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union is evident in Europe and also in the Far East; this has been the case for a long time, and the Tianjin situation proves it to be true. However, Britain is filled with anxiety about linking with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union is pleased to be arrogant and stubborn toward Britain. As a result, the factor that could most contribute to stability in the Far East is suppressed by the power struggle between the two sides. This is a second, closer demon. The various plans for dealing with Japan that Britain has proclaimed today and yesterday, if implemented, would certainly be effective. However, the traditional British view is that simply mentioning these plans is enough to make Japan wary, so they do not consider implementation to be necessary action but propaganda to be an effective method. Although the British are the most pragmatic nation in the world and despise politicians and propagandists who only talk and do nothing, they are blinded by their traditional self-esteem, overestimating themselves. They often believe that their propaganda is extraordinary because it has the backing of real strength, and that listeners will know to be wary, and that being wary is effective. How could they know that Japan's assessment of Britain is not as high as Britain's self-assessment, and that the assessment of Britain by the Japanese military in power is not as high as the assessment of Britain by Japanese moderates? Because of this discrepancy, Japan disregards Britain's desired effect from "plans" because they are merely plans. This is something that the self-respecting and self-deluded British tradition cannot imagine. This is a third, internal demon. It is these three demons that make the future outcome unpredictable and a great mystery. The sword to exorcise these demons is swift action! Arrived to be checked, but was pushed out of his standing place by a Japanese officer, as was Mr. MacKenzie. He was stripped naked by a Japanese sentry this morning when he passed through the British Concession. When he later returned to the British Concession, he was blocked by Japanese sentries and prevented from proceeding. He stood there for four hours until he walked to another entrance and was finally allowed to pass. The detention of Mr. Howard and the harassment of British men and women are common occurrences. The attitude of Japanese sentries towards the British is deteriorating daily. Many British people have been stripped naked. The British in this concession are extremely angry to learn that many British people have been stripped naked by Japanese sentries. The congestion at the seven sentry lines today is much worse than yesterday. However, the vegetable problem has improved since the vegetable boats were allowed to dock on the British concession's riverbank. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources received here today, 50,000 Japanese are currently preparing to peacefully occupy the British concession in Tianjin today. These Japanese residents in Tianjin have decided to visit the graves of Japanese soldiers who died in the Boxer Rebellion. On Saturday and Sunday, 2,000 Japanese reservists will also march in formation in the British concession to visit the graves of Japanese soldiers. According to the Japanese news, the number of trains traveling between the Japanese concession in Tianjin, the Chinese area, and the British and French concessions has been reduced to one-fifth of normal due to Japanese restrictions. Normally, about 100,000 Chinese workers enter the British and French concessions every day, but only less than 2,000 were allowed to enter by noon yesterday. Japanese in Tianjin announced via loudspeakers that they were sorry for the slow inspection procedures, but this was unavoidable because they wanted to eliminate the communists who were based in the British concession. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Threatens Britain</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma met with Foreign Minister Arita and Army Minister Itagaki yesterday to discuss the blockade of the Tianjin concessions and the entire issue of foreign concessions in China. It is reported that the Japanese government has decided to maintain the blockade of the Tianjin concessions until the authorities in North China unconditionally accept the decisions of the Japanese authorities. Army Minister Itagaki then visited the Emperor to report on the Tianjin issue. Yomiuri Shimbun "claims that foreign political figures believe that the Japanese authorities will soon take the same steps in Shanghai as in Tianjin. The newspaper firmly believes that the attitudes of Britain and France will make Japanese public opinion hostile to Britain and France. (Transocean News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Foreign Ministry issued a premonitory warning, stating that if Britain attempts to retaliate against Japan for the Japanese military's blockade of the Tianjin concessions, Japan's attitude towards Britain will become even tougher. Furthermore, the Foreign Ministry news stated that if Britain takes retaliatory action in other areas, the situation in Tianjin will "worsen." According to recent news from London, the British Cabinet has ordered the British Board of Trade to study effective methods of retaliation. The Japanese Foreign Ministry recently stated that the actions in Tianjin were entirely directed against Britain. The Japanese Consul in Tianjin has declared to the American and French Consuls that their respective countries' interests will be respected. According to foreign observers here, Japan is trying to infringe on the treaty rights of third countries through a divide-and-conquer strategy to prevent a united front of Britain, the United States, and France. Furthermore, a Japanese naval spokesman stated that although the Japanese Navy did not directly participate in the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, it would support the Japanese authorities in Tianjin if necessary in the future. The spokesman also said that since the Kulangsu Municipal Council has rejected Japanese control of the concession, the residents there have experienced inconvenience due to the Municipal Council's "ineffective actions." He also said that foreigners in Chongqing and Chengdu should urge the Chinese authorities to remove defensive fortifications near foreign properties "to avoid friction." He also said that during recent Japanese bombing raids in Chongqing and Chengdu, Chinese anti-aircraft positions were located near foreign properties. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>British Cabinet Considers Retaliatory Measures</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the British government is currently awaiting a response from the Japanese side. Before receiving a response, the British side will not decide on any retaliatory policies. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the Tianjin incident yesterday, but the resolutions made remain strictly confidential. As for Britain's appeal to the United States to mediate the British-Japanese dispute, all parties believe it to be extremely important, as this type of development is unprecedented. It is reported that the British side proposed to Japan that the US Consul-General in Tianjin, Mr. Cortney, be a neutral figure in the two-member mediation committee. Although the Japanese side has already rejected the British proposal, the US government's agreement to have Mr. Cortney chair the mediation committee is extremely important. Furthermore, the British government is still in constant contact with the United States and France to obtain parallel or joint action to deal with Japan's strangulation strategy in the Chinese concessions. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) After Japan implemented the blockade of the Tianjin and French concessions, it is considered here that the situation is extremely serious. The government is currently considering economic retaliatory measures, with the Board of Trade drafting tax rules to increase special taxes on Japanese goods and considering banning Japanese ships from docking at British ports in the Far East. The British and French governments exchanged views on these measures yesterday. At the same time, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, presented a proposed solution. The retaliatory plan will be implemented as soon as a negative response is received from the Japanese side. London newspapers today published reports on the Tianjin situation with large front-page headlines. The "Daily Mail" expressed doubt about the hope of a British-Japanese compromise, believing that Japan will insist on the following three points: (1) Britain will no longer support Chinese currency; (2) Britain guarantees that it will no longer shelter "Communists and terrorists" in the concessions; (3) Britain must cooperate with Japan to establish a new order in China. All of this is difficult for the British government to accept and will be insisted upon by the Japanese side, so the hope of compromise is extremely slim. The newspaper is particularly optimistic about the economic retaliatory measures proposed by Britain, pointing out that Japan is an industrial country, and its few resources have been exhausted in the war against China. It will definitely not be able to withstand Britain's economic sanctions. The "Daily Express" strongly argues that if Britain and Australia act jointly, Japan will definitely be unable to cope. A "Chronicle News" warns the government not to accept Japan's demands, saying that this would show weakness to Japan and set a bad precedent, and Japan will successively interfere in other concessions in China. The "Financial Times" has learned that regarding retaliatory measures against Japan, the British Board of Trade is currently considering canceling the British-Japanese commercial agreement.

<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, the British Cabinet considered the issue of imposing economic sanctions on Japan at a meeting yesterday. The measures may be directed at Japanese exports to Britain and the Commonwealth and India. The Board of Trade is considering changing the preferential tariffs enjoyed by Japan in British colonies. British authorities believe that effective economic measures can subdue Japan. (Transocean News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) After the British Cabinet meeting, a government spokesman declared that the British authorities in Tianjin would adopt a strong and unyielding attitude towards the Japanese blockade of the British concession. However, the British government side is inevitably somewhat uneasy. The Japanese Ambassador Toshio Shiratori's visit to Berlin is clearly a new attempt to pull Japan into the German-Italian military alliance. The government authorities anticipate that Japan will reject the third-party mediation action, so they are currently considering economic retaliatory measures. It is heard that the Foreign Office also advocates taking retaliatory measures, but the Board of Trade and the Treasury are strongly opposed. Treasury officials believe that the Tianjin matter is not worth making a big deal of and causing a major conflict between Britain and Japan. Therefore, the government is currently trying to create a united front with the governments of various regions and countries such as France and the United States. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Havas News Agency reporters learned that the British Cabinet discussed the situation in Tianjin, China, today and immediately decided to order the Board of Trade to draft a report outlining various measures that could be used to retaliate against Japan economically, so that they could be gradually and effectively implemented if the British concession in Tianjin was blockaded for too long. It is heard that the retaliatory measures include the following: (1) Imposing special taxes on Japanese ships anchored in British ports or restricting their right to anchor in these ports; (2) Imposing import duties and restricting the quantity of Japanese goods imported into British colonies; (3) Taking certain actions against Japanese currency. At this moment, the British government is awaiting a report from Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie to learn whether the Japanese government supports the actions of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin. People in the government believe that there is not much hope for easing the situation and that retaliatory measures must be implemented sooner or later. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Britain and France to File Joint Protest</p>
<p>(Paris) According to political figures here, Prime Minister Daladier met with British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps yesterday to discuss the tense situation in Tianjin. It is learned that Britain and France will file a joint note to Japan to protest Japan's blockade of the Tianjin concessions and state that if Japan continues the blockade, the British authorities will not allow Japanese ships to sail to Singapore. (Transocean News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>London is closely exchanging views with the United States and France on the policy of the Japanese military's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, China. Dominion Affairs Minister Sir Inskip held a meeting this morning with the senior commissioners of the various Dominions in London to discuss the government's methods for restricting trade with Japan in all parts of the British Empire. The government authorities also scheduled to make a statement in the Lower House this afternoon. (Havas News Agency, 15th) The British and French governments informally exchanged views on the Tianjin situation this morning. According to sources here, France believes that the United States, France, and the United Kingdom</p>
<p>(Paris) The British and French governments informally exchanged views on the Tianjin situation this morning. Sources here say that France believes that the United States, France, and the United Kingdom are most concerned about the Chinese concessions, and it is necessary to maintain close contact with each other. It is solemnly stated that the best results can be obtained through parallel action. At the same time, it is recognized that the situation in Tianjin is quite subtle and that most of this matter should be left to the local authorities to negotiate. Policy authorities also hope that this matter will be resolved satisfactorily locally. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>United States Denies Offering Mediation</p>
<p>(Washington) According to State Department officials yesterday, the US government authorities may consider rejecting the suggestion to establish a three-person committee, but the US side still believes that mediation can be effective. Furthermore, according to Secretary of State Hull, it is rumored that the British side intends to invite the US Consul-General in Tianjin to serve as chairman of the three-person committee, but he has not yet been able to confirm this news. He also said that US diplomats stationed in Tianjin are currently preparing all necessary measures to protect American residents there. The US State Department has not sent special instructions to the Tianjin Consulate General, but the authorities at the Consulate General have full authority to deal with everything to ensure the rights of American residents. Hull then declared that the US Far East Fleet Commander's yacht "Isabel" and the US ships "Trenton" and "Augusta" are currently docked at Qinhuangdao. As for the situation in Kulangsu, there is no progress. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department today emphatically denied the claim that the United States has stepped in to mediate the Tianjin issue. Secretary of State Hull said in response to a question about this matter that he was unaware of any other country contacting the United States about mediation issues. The United States has decided to make all possible contributions to ease the overall situation. Hull was unwilling to say that the situations in Tianjin and Kulangsu were the same, but said that the two situations were definitely different. He also said that US representatives are paying attention to the status of Tianjin in every possible way and will protect the American people and their rights there within the permissible scope. The United States is currently submitting full and adequate representations to the Japanese side at any time to address specific incidents that the Japanese authorities should be aware of. The United States has previously ordered its shipping industry not to transport munitions or war materials into war zones, including Tianjin, and warned shipowners that if ships do not comply with this, they will bear the risk and responsibility. The United States has not had special exchanges of views with Tokyo regarding the Kulangsu International Settlement. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Ambassador to Japan Grew, who is currently in the country reporting on his duties, exchanged views with President Roosevelt on the Far East situation yesterday and also exchanged views with Secretary of State Hull all day long because of the increasingly tense relations between Japan and third countries in Tianjin. According to State Department officials, the United States is well aware that the harm suffered by American interests in Tianjin due to the Japanese blockade is no different from the impact on British and French interests. Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference yesterday that he was paying full attention to the Far East issue. According to Hull, US representatives stationed in Tianjin and Tokyo "will do their utmost to seek a relaxation of the Tianjin situation." The US government is worried that Japanese demands may lead to regrettable unfortunate incidents. However, if the Japanese side attempts to take actions in Tianjin that undermine the treaty rights of foreigners, the United States will take strong retaliatory action. Hull also made some remarks on the Kulangsu incident, stating that he had instructed US representatives stationed in Tokyo to warn Americans not to undermine the rights of Americans in that area. From this, it can be seen that Hull believes that the situation in Tianjin is the same as the situation in Kulangsu. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>

<p>British and French Newspapers Unanimously Criticize</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the newspapers here unanimously demanded strong action. However, the "Financial News" stated that it was quite difficult to implement economic sanctions against Japan, implying that the authorities should act cautiously. The "Manchester Guardian" still said that compromise was hopeful, and Japan might not oppose the arbitration method proposed by Britain. The "Financial Times" believed that the situation in Tianjin was very serious. "As a result of Japan's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, it has become necessary for Britain to take economic retaliatory measures. The Board of Trade is considering it from an economic and commercial standpoint. If Japan insists on its own way and adheres to its views, Britain will adopt two retaliatory measures: (1) Large-scale economic retaliation; (2) Abolishing the British-Japanese commercial agreement and canceling the preferential treatment of Japanese goods in the British Empire market." The British government attaches great importance to this matter and is currently maintaining close contact with the French and American governments. In addition, the "Daily Express" stated, "Japan's war against China has not gained any benefits or honor. This decision clearly wants to achieve a victory in diplomacy to cover up its military failures." (Havas News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers continued to comment on Japan's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin today. Excerpts from the opinions of three London newspapers are quoted below to show the general sentiment in Britain. The Daily Express claimed that Japan's war against China had gained neither benefits nor honor, and now it hoped to cover up its military failure with a diplomatic victory. The Tianjin incident raised the entire issue of our concessions in China. We should be prepared to hand over the concessions, but we must hand over the concessions to the Chinese, not the Japanese. We can concede to the landlords, but not to the thieves. The Daily News claimed that Japan was simply using the case of the four Chinese involved in the assassination of Cheng as an excuse to create an incident to destroy British interests in the Far East and wipe out British prestige. The Financial News claimed that the British concession in Tianjin was now blockaded, and the entire question of how far Britain was prepared to protect its Far East interests had arisen. The difficulties of taking action within the economic sphere seemed unavoidable. Britain needed the cooperation of India, Australia, and the United States. However, economic sanctions must ultimately be supported by force. The policy we have adopted in the past eight years to deal with Japanese aggression seems to indicate that Britain still hopes to solve this problem with delaying tactics alone, but Japan today seems to force us to make a decision. We can only prepare to maintain the long shipping lanes of its empire and commerce, or we must shorten them. Apart from this, there is no third way. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers all regard the simultaneous occurrence of Japan's sudden action in Tianjin and the arrival of British Foreign Office representative Sterndale in Moscow as having great significance. The newspaper Le Temps carried the comments of right-wing member of parliament M. Gracos, who said that he was deeply impressed by this coincidence and believed that since Germany and Italy could not obtain Japan's consent to cooperate with the navy in the Mediterranean, they pressured Japan to strike at least during the critical period of European negotiations. Le Figaro said that Japan's actions in Tianjin had four motives: (1) To threaten Britain when Sterndale went to Moscow; (2) Although the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance has nothing to do with Japan, Japan is using the Tianjin action as a response to the three-nation alliance; (3) Obedience to German instigation; (4) To divert the attention of the people from the war in China. L'Humanité said that the Japanese government is working for the Axis powers and wants to prevent the realization of a peace front by means of terror and threats. L'Œuvre carried the comments of Mrs. Taboui, who said that if Britain stood firm and refused to give in, the blockade of the Tianjin concession would not need to be overemphasized in her view, because Japan was just using this to test Britain's strength in order to take action in Shanghai. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) In the "Intransigeant," Philibert Verrine published an editorial in the newspaper yesterday, explaining France's point of view on the situation in Tianjin, declaring that the evolution of the situation in Tianjin was by no means an isolated event, but a new impetus on the international stage. Japan is now using the request for the extradition of four Chinese as an excuse to launch anti-British demonstrations, with the aim of increasing Britain's troubles in the Far East and thus providing assistance to Japan's European allies. "Paris-Soir" believes that the United States, Britain, and France do not want the Tianjin incident to develop into a serious situation and will seek a solution with Japan within the realm of possibility. The newspaper hints that the attention of Western countries is still focused on the European situation, and Paris believes that Japan's actions in Tianjin will promote the early conclusion of the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance, as Moscow must be more enthusiastic about concluding an agreement because of Japan's recent attitude. (Transocean News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>The Shanghai newspaper North China Daily News carried an editorial yesterday, discussing the Tianjin blockade, which stated, "Tokyo has clearly realized that the end of the war against China, even today, is as elusive as it was at the beginning of the war, and that it will take another two or three years to defeat China's resistance. At the same time, the position of the Japanese military is very embarrassing, so it has to take action to show that the lives and money lost in the war have not been thrown into a void. Therefore, it is clamoring and acting outrageously in foreign concessions in China in order to divert the attention of the Japanese people and prevent them from focusing their attention on the magnificent war, which has lasted for a long time, and the future of the Japanese army in China is still a long and terrible struggle. Even though the Japanese army has fought to this day, it is still uncertain whether it can obtain the victory that it hoped for when it began this very tragic adventure."</p>
<p>German Public Opinion Intentionally Sides with Japan</p>
<p>(Berlin) The situation in Tianjin, China, has recently been commented on by the newspapers here, all of which say that this is a "contest" between Britain and Japan. The "Attack News" stated that "Britain and France only know how to be selfish and constantly obstruct Japan's progress in China. Japan must fight with Britain and France in order to complete its plans in China." (Havas News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, by the Japanese military has recently been commented on by the newspapers, all of which are attacking Britain. The "Westphalian Local Daily" joked that "the British concession is now surrounded by barbed wire, which is no different from a quarantined area for epidemics. The British should not be surprised by this. Those British people, who regard themselves as the masters of the world in the British concessions everywhere in China, are completely ignorant of the new developments in the Far East, which is narrow-minded and arrogant." The "Essen National Daily" (the organ of Air Minister General Göring) stated, "Britain is a defeated imperialist country," and it is not worth using all its strength in a corner of the Far East. "For Japan's sake, there is no reason to take action based on this view, because it would take great strength for Japan to compete with Britain at this moment, which is not worth it. If it can be delayed slightly, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort." In short, the British concessions in China are not assets, but liabilities. (Havas News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Situation in Tianjin Extremely Tense. Chamberlain Expresses Important Views. Acknowledges Japanese Demands Sufficient to Cause Significant Political Issues. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, Ordered to Negotiate with Japan. British Side Maintaining Close Contact with the United States and France. Kulangsu Also Blockaded by Japanese Troops. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the British military authorities in Tianjin, in light of the Japanese blockade, are taking various precautions to maintain order within the concession. The British escort vessel HMS Lowestoft (990 tons) is currently docked alongside the British concession on the river. Today, due to the illness of opposition leader Attlee, Labour Party leader Greenwood spoke on his behalf to inquire about the situation in Tianjin. The Prime Minister responded that the blockade of the foreign concessions in Tianjin began at 6:00 AM on June 14th. Britons and other foreigners entering and leaving the concessions are being stopped and searched at roadblocks. It is understood that food is still permitted to be brought into the concessions, but prices appear to be trending upwards. Britons traveling along the Bai River are also being subjected to interference. British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, has raised the matter with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and has been ordered to indicate to the Japanese government the danger of provocative actions by the Japanese authorities in Tianjin, fearing that they may lead to regrettable incidents. Sir Robert has also asked Arita to note that a certain spokesman for the Japanese side in Tianjin has stated that the current issue in dispute cannot be resolved even if the British authorities hand over the four defendants sought by the Japanese. The purpose of the blockade is to obtain a broader form of cooperation from the British authorities in China. The implications are indeed serious. If these words represent the views of the North China authorities, then the Japanese are clearly plotting incidents to achieve demands that are broader and more far-reaching than the extradition of the four individuals. Such demands will raise significant policy issues involving other major powers beyond just Great Britain. The British government is currently maintaining the closest possible contact with the French government. At the same time, the British government is considering the overall situation arising from the Japanese refusal to accept the recommendations of the proposed investigative committee and the continued blockade of the concessions. After the Prime Minister finished his answer, several more members of parliament raised questions. Labour Party leader Henderson asked whether the government intends to invoke Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty, which stipulates that the signatory nations should fully consult with each other when a situation arises that violates the principles of the treaty. The Prime Minister replied that the overall situation is clearly very serious and the British government is currently considering all aspects. As for what action we will decide to take, it is not yet possible to inform you at this time. Conservative MP Milner asked whether the Prime Minister would consider notifying the Japanese government that if they do not lift the blockade within 24 hours, the British government will declare the abrogation of the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty. The Prime Minister replied that he could not add anything to what he had just stated. Opposition Liberal Party MP Manderville proposed convening a special meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council to consider what steps could be taken to solemnly express the international nature of this case. The Prime Minister reiterated that he could not yet predict what steps the government might decide to take. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Japanese authorities in North China have decided to continue isolating the British and French concessions in Tianjin until the United Kingdom drastically revises its pro-Chiang and anti-Japanese attitude. Any incomplete compromises will be rejected. It is reported that the above decision was adopted by the military and political representatives of Japan stationed in North China after a three-day meeting, which concluded yesterday. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The Japanese have begun to blockade Kulangsu. Three Japanese warships are currently preventing various supplies from entering from the mainland, causing the 50,000 residents of the Kulangsu International Settlement to face a perilous situation. Japanese newspapers report that matches, coke, and vegetables are all prohibited from being transported to Kulangsu. According to a Japanese spokesman, the Japanese intention is to make the Kulangsu Municipal Council aware of Japan's demands. It is surprising that this blockade action has suddenly occurred, as the Japanese authorities recently declared their willingness to cooperate with the Municipal Council to suppress anti-Japanese activities. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to today's Japanese report from Xiamen, the Japanese are now planning to take immediate action against the Asiatic Petroleum Company's ship "Yangtaishan." It is reported that the reason for the blockade of Kulangsu is that this ship was smuggling people and food from the mainland to Kulangsu. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The situation in Kulangsu is said to be becoming tense again. The reason is that the Japanese have again made various demands on the Municipal Council for the management of the concession. At the same time, the Japanese Navy is said to have blockaded Kulangsu, resulting in severe food shortages. It is reported that the Kulangsu Municipal Council has lodged a very strong protest against this blockade. According to observations here, negotiations between the Kulangsu Municipal Council and the Japanese side have broken down. Therefore, apart from taking military action against the American, British, and French Marines on the island, the only option for the Japanese is to lower their demands. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Navy Ministry spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa stated today at a press conference that the Kulangsu incident has not yet been resolved. The Japanese authorities are determined to seek a peaceful resolution to this issue, but negotiations have reached a stalemate because third countries and the Kulangsu Municipal Council continue to maintain a stubborn attitude and refuse to acknowledge the current situation. The Municipal Council is poorly organized and lacks the ability to maintain peace and order within the concession. The local Japanese authorities have no choice but to send marines ashore until peace and order are fully maintained. The Japanese authorities have also suspended traffic between Kulangsu and the mainland to prevent unlawful elements from sneaking back and forth. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Yesterday's Tense Situation</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today is the second day of the Japanese blockade of the foreign concessions in Tianjin. There have been no serious developments in the concessions. The important events of today are as follows: (1) Agitators incited two thousand Chinese to rush into the British concession defense line, but their plan failed. (2) Police in the former German concession distributed inflammatory leaflets. (3) Several foreign ships were stopped and searched. The food supply problem in the concessions is gradually becoming serious. Although the Japanese claim to allow food to be freely transported into the concessions, the amount of vegetables, meat, and milk transported in the past two days has been minimal. There is almost nothing for sale in the vegetable markets. Some are engaging in monopolistic hoarding, with prices of various goods rising by 20% to 70%. However, the price of canned food remains the same. A Reuters reporter heard from eyewitnesses that a Chinese man pushed a cart full of vegetables and stopped near an unguarded barbed wire fence, throwing the vegetables, along with the baskets, over the obstacle. Residents inside the concession then scrambled for them. In the early morning, two thousand Chinese lined up outside the British concession, waiting for Japanese soldiers to inspect them so that they could enter the British concession along Racecourse Road. Then agitators incited them to rush into the concession's defense line. At this time, a British light infantry unit, hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene with machine guns, deploying in a defensive formation with fixed bayonets. The crowd showed no intention of rushing into the concession. The agitators could do nothing. The crowd waited until 3:00 PM, but the inspection was still not completed, and there was no legitimate opportunity to enter the concession, so they dispersed. The British infantry also withdrew at 3:30 PM. Uniformed Chinese police in the former German concession openly participated in the distribution of inflammatory texts. Several leaflets were blown by the wind into the British concession. Colored leaflets were posted outside the British and French concessions, inciting the public to oppose the concessions. The slogans were as follows: (1) All Chinese should immediately leave the British and French concessions. (2) The British concession is a haven for communists. (3) Recovering the concessions will end the chaos. Today, among the foreign ships stopped and searched by the Japanese, one was the Navy, flying the Norwegian flag. This ship left Tianjin in the early morning, intending to go to Tanggu, but was stopped at the Dalian Steamship Company pier. It was released only after a thorough inspection. Later, two more barges were also stopped at the same location. The inspectors wanted to unpack the cargo for inspection, but the boatmen strongly objected, saying that the goods were sealed by customs and could not be opened. The two sides were deadlocked. Because the goods belonged to German merchants, the boatmen appealed to the German merchants and asked for help from the German consul in Tianjin. At the same time, customs also reported the detention of the ships and the dismantling of the packages for inspection to the inspectors. As a result, the two barges were finally released. The French ship Taishenghang, chartered by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Tianjin this afternoon (docked at the Dalian Steamship Company pier awaiting inspection, which took 15 minutes to complete). According to the crew, the Japanese inspectors were still polite. This ship was the first foreign ship to arrive in Tianjin after the blockade. Although no important incidents occurred yesterday, it was heard that many foreigners were humiliated. Several British expatriates were paid special attention to and were detained for detailed questioning. Some cars were damaged, causing delays of one hour. Several British expatriates were forced to take off their shoes and socks. It is said that the Japanese authorities are also creating difficulties for Japanese people who want to enter the foreign concessions, but German expatriates are treated more leniently. However, at least two German women were inspected. A Russian woman, although she showed a certificate of registration from the local anti-communist committee, was still subject to inspection, but it was done by a woman and she was not stripped. Some British people were also forced to wait for inspection and release in the same place as the Chinese. The inspection was extremely slow, and pedestrians suffered from it. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Japanese news, at 12:30 PM today, 30 British soldiers, accompanied by 20 Chinese police, drove in three trucks to the border between the British concession and the First Special District and set up obstacles and added sentry posts. The posts were only a few meters away from the Japanese sentry posts. A light machine gun was also added near the British sentry post, with its muzzle aimed at the Japanese sentry post. At 2:05 PM, another 30 British regular soldiers and 20 Chinese police arrived, carrying 11 light and heavy machine guns. At 4:00 PM, three Japanese tanks rushed to the vicinity of the Japanese sentry post. An hour and a half later, the British troops withdrew, and the machine guns were also taken away. The time was 5:20 PM. Within these five hours this afternoon, the situation in Tianjin was very tense. (Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) All British expatriates here were extremely angry today upon reading the notice issued by the British consulate regarding several British expatriates being "forced to remove their shoes and socks" by Japanese sentries. The initial news was that the Japanese sentries implementing the blockade of the British and French concessions had forced British expatriates to remove their shoes and socks during inspection. At the same time, the Japanese blockade around the British and French concessions was tighter today than yesterday, making the seven entrances to the concessions even more crowded. This morning, the food supply situation was slightly eased as boats loaded with vegetables arrived off the Bund of the British concession. British man Melville, employed by the Fox Film Corporation, was arrested by Japanese troops yesterday while filming Japanese inspection operations. He is still being detained by the Japanese side this morning. The British authorities are making efforts to negotiate and demand his release. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Two Thousand Vagrants Plot to Rush the Concession</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the Japanese blockade of the concessions, no unfortunate incidents have occurred due to the firm and unyielding attitude of the British. Today, more than two thousand Chinese gathered at the Racecourse Road intersection, apparently intending to rush into the concession and demonstrate under the direction of the Japanese. At this time, the British army immediately reinforced the area, setting up machine guns, and the bayonets on the rifles were also fixed, flashing brightly. Therefore, these Chinese, who were being used by others, did not dare to take any action. At 3:00 PM, they ignored the instigations of plainclothes agitators and scattered like birds and beasts. According to British military officers, these plainclothes personnel were either Japanese or Koreans. There were two incidents of British people being humiliated by Japanese sentries: (1) Mr. Howarth was struck with the scabbard of a bayonet by a Japanese officer at the Racecourse Road intersection. Fortunately, he was not injured. Mr. Howarth was standing in the same</p>

Japanese planes dropped more than a dozen bombs there, but they all landed on barren land outside the city, so there was not much damage. However, when Japanese planes bombed Changde on Tuesday, it caused several major fires. Because it was impossible to put them out, they were allowed to burn until tomorrow. Houses on several main streets were all turned into ruins, and the number of homeless civilians reached several thousand.

<p>On the Question of Resolute Resistance</p>
<h3 id="e5">President Kong's Opinion <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) The War of Resistance has now lasted for two years. As we recall the evolution of the domestic and international situation over the past two years and look forward to the future of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, we firmly believe that Japan will be forced to change its national policy one day, and we are confident of achieving final victory. Now, please allow me to list a few of the most prominent facts for the consideration of our compatriots. (1) In the military sphere, our preparations for national defense and military affairs are not as thorough as those of the Japanese. This is an undeniable fact. However, judging from the situation of the battles over the past two years, it is sufficient to prove that we are growing stronger as we fight, while the Japanese are growing weaker. Regardless of the use of strategy and tactics, the replenishment of personnel, or the supply of equipment, we have made considerable progress. The results of successive battles have also proven that the Japanese have neither the certainty of victory nor the ability to defend. (2) In the diplomatic sphere, Japan's policy of aggression is not only directed at China but at the entire world. Therefore, our resistance against Japan is nothing less than acting as a defense team for justice throughout the world and bolstering the strength of the peace front. As a result, the sympathy and assistance of various countries for us is becoming increasingly active. In the recent resolution of the League of Nations Executive Council, it has been clearly stated that "Japan is an aggressor state." This is a major step forward in international diplomacy. Now that the forces of world peace are gradually rising, Japan's international relations are becoming increasingly isolated. (3) In the economic sphere, our greatest success in the economic sphere has been the victory in the currency war. Since March of last year, when the Japanese established the "Pseudo-United Reserve Bank" in North China and issued counterfeit currency in an attempt to seize our foreign exchange reserves and undermine the credit of our legal currency, we have implemented foreign exchange controls in order to prevent the Japanese plot. For more than a year, the results have been remarkable. Seeing that their plans were not succeeding, the Japanese used various means to undermine our legal currency policy, first suppressing the price of our legal currency in their occupied areas, and then simply banning the circulation of our legal currency on the market. However, they do not know that our legal currency is sufficiently backed and has outstanding credit. Now that our foreign exchange rate has been adjusted, the Japanese have no more tricks to play. Another hidden crisis lurking on the Japanese side in the economic sphere is, first, the stagnation of domestic production, and second, the increase in the suffering of the people. Due to the unlimited expansion of the military-industrial complex, all domestic capital and labor are absorbed, while imports of raw materials are reduced, and the production volume of ordinary industries is greatly reduced. As a result, export trade suffers extremely adverse effects. As for agricultural production, it has always been very poor, and now it is even more declining. Last year, the production of all rice, silkworms, and lotus roots was greatly reduced. As for the reasons for the increased suffering of the Japanese people, they are mostly due to the increased burden and the soaring prices. According to reliable estimates, the Japanese have actually spent more than 11.99 billion yuan in military expenses in the first year and a half of the invasion of China. No matter how cleverly Japanese financiers apply this huge amount of military expenses, the result will be that it will eventually be extracted from the Japanese people. How can the people of a small country of tens of millions bear such a huge war expenditure every year? In addition, production is declining, the value of the currency is falling, and the prices of daily necessities are soaring, resulting in a year-round of hard work and not enough to eat. As a result, the anti-war movement is lurking and growing, with a great potential for explosion. Because the Japanese have repeatedly tried all kinds of conspiracies and strategies without success, they have resorted to ulterior motives, deliberately creating all kinds of atmosphere, attempting to alienate our domestic unity and disperse our strength to resist the war, and even concocting many provocative rumors. Our War of Resistance is a necessary action to seek survival and self-preservation for the nation. Chairman Chiang has inherited the legacy of Sun Yat-sen, and based on the demands of the entire people, he leads the War of Resistance and implements national policy. Government colleagues and the people of the entire country, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, are united in sincerity, and will become more resilient over time. It is seen that the strength of unity will be enhanced, and the War of Resistance will be victorious. National reconstruction will be successful, and both will fulfill their missions in this kind of sincere inspiration. O patriotic compatriots, let us strengthen our faith, concentrate our strength, and move toward this common goal! (Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Kunming-Xufu Highway Still Difficult to Travel</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to foreign reports, the new highway between Kunming and Xufu will take at least five more months to complete. Some of this road has been built, and there was talk of opening it soon, but a foreign engineer who attempted to drive a truck along this road has had to abandon this attempt. According to him, many rivers do not have bridges, and he was only able to proceed by building temporary crossing bridges himself. The road construction along the way is not perfect. He has traveled more than two-thirds of the entire journey, but more than 100 kilometers in the middle are still under construction, so he had to stop the trip. This highway is very important in China's current transportation situation and can alleviate the congestion of the Chongqing-Guizhou-Kunming highway. It should be operated with greater effort. Therefore, foreign businesses were somewhat disappointed to hear this news. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

If anyone wants to impose a guarantee on our country, it will be regarded as a threat, and we will rise up to defend our independence. In short, no matter which country attempts to force a guarantee on us, its actions are obviously contrary to peace, and are sufficient to cause the issue of aggression. It also seems that there is a lack of clear understanding of national sovereignty. As for our country's fortification of the Åland Islands, the Soviet Union has expressed opposition.

<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Conference met this afternoon. The first speaker was Mr. Harriman, the US employer representative, who said that the way to save today's turbulent world is nothing more than the following: 1.

Reduce tariff barriers; 4. Hold an international conference and sign a new treaty of peace based on good intentions.

<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Conference met this morning. Li Pingheng, the Chinese government representative, delivered a moving speech, the gist of which was: "China currently has only two paths to follow: either surrender or resist. Based on our duty, we have now decided to resist to the end." He also reviewed the international situation in the past year, saying, "A country here can lose its independence without even a day. Concessions made to aggressor nations, no matter how broad the scope of the concessions, are definitely not enough to maintain peace. The experience of the past few years has already shown this to the world. It is said that war can be localized, but this is just wishful thinking. It is also wrong to abandon the collective security system. The Chinese people are now suffering the pain of modern warfare. This resistance is not only for their survival and freedom, but also for peace, justice, and international law. Peace, justice, and international law are what all civilized countries in the world should strive to achieve with all their strength. Although our country has been resisting for 23 months, its social progress, economic development, and other reconstruction work have not been suspended due to the war. It is also engaged in great work in the fields of economy, transportation, and communications. At this time, countries that supply Japan with military equipment are in fact hindering their own interests. Since 1937, Japan's exports to China have increased year by year, while the exports of the United States, Germany, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies to China have gradually decreased. The United States, which was originally the top country in trade with China, has been replaced by Japan." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(London) According to the Times correspondent in Prague, the arrival of Heinrich Himmler, the head of the German secret police, in Prague has increased the feeling that an accident may occur. The incidents of Germans and Czechs being killed in Kladno and Nachod recently have given people the feeling that some kind of change will occur soon. Some Czechs believe that the change in the protectorate system will be followed by German action in Slovakia. Germany has already placed a garrison in Slovakia, and in recent weeks has concentrated troops in northeastern Moravia near the Slovak border. Germany can seize Slovakia without having to mobilize large numbers of troops from within the country. The correspondent also listed the following two events as signs that Germany intends to take some action in the next few days: 1. All train locomotives in Pardubice and Prague have been ordered to be fired up and ready to depart within the next two days; 2. All non-military traffic will be suspended on the roads from Brno to Olmütz and Jihlava during the same period. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e27">New Victory for Guangxi Province's Resistance War: New Defense Lines Redefined for the West River and Southern Route; Third Conscription Adds 50,000 to the Ranks <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Wuzhou dispatch: Japanese troops invading Guangdong have repeatedly attempted to enter Guangxi Province via the West River and Southern Route. However, on the West River front, they were met with a head-on blow from the Chinese army. The Japanese troops could only linger downstream of Sanshui and could not advance. Along the Southern Route coastline, Japanese warships seemed to have some apprehension and also hesitated at the shore, unable to land. However, the Guangxi authorities have made considerable efforts and progress in defense work, troop training, equipment replenishment, and public organization. According to a military expert, the strength of Guangxi's resistance war before January of this year, compared to after January, is estimated to have increased at least tenfold. The Japanese army failed to capture Guangxi Province in the first half of this year, and it will be even more difficult for them to succeed in the future. Xia Wei, the commander of the Guangxi XX Army, was promoted to commander-in-chief of the XX Group Army and is in charge of military affairs on both the West River and Southern Route fronts. He has newly equipped the defense areas. On the West River front, from Zhaoqing, going upstream to Wuzhou, there are three defense lines. On the Southern Route front, from the Leizhou Peninsula, through Suixi, Lianjiang, Huazhou, Maoming, to Yulin and Luchuan, and from Beihai, through Hepu, Qin County, Lingshan, to Nanning, there are also three defense lines. Each defense line is stationed with a considerable number of regular troops, cooperating with local militia and guerrillas, making the defense exceptionally tight.</p>
<p>During the early stages of the resistance war, Guangxi Province originally had seven divisions of active-duty troops. In addition to transferring all of them north, it also slightly mobilized two batches of conscripts, totaling 500,000 men. Of these 500,000 conscripts, 350,000 were transferred to the Northeast war zones for replenishment, and 150,000 remained in Guangxi for internal training. Therefore, Guangxi Province often maintained seven divisions of active-duty troops internally. After the extension of the defense lines, they were distributed to the West River and Southern Route. From June 1st, the Guangxi Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government jointly issued an order to carry out the third conscription plan, conscripting an average of 500 men from each county, totaling 50,000 men. Adding the previous numbers, there are 200,000 regular troops in the province, not including the self-defense corps, guerrillas, and special units. In addition to the above-mentioned various troops, there are also volunteer student soldiers. There are currently as many as six regiments trained, all of whom are middle school and above students. These troops are of excellent quality and high knowledge. Their training subjects are arranged according to the students' wishes. Some are trained as mechanized elite troops, while the rest are incorporated into political work groups, battlefield propaganda groups, and battlefield service groups.</p>
<p>Shuyang Military and Civilians Recover the County Seat</p>
<p>Many Japanese and Puppet Troops Killed</p>
<p>Shuyang dispatch: Since Shuyang fell, the county magistrate, Xia Dingwen, moved the county's standing troops and police brigade to the countryside, and reorganized the standing troops in each district of the county, and reorganized the armed masses in each district. As a result, the entire county's military force was completely renewed. On the 3rd of this month, at dawn, Magistrate Xia personally led the county's standing troops, self-defense forces in various districts, and armed masses, totaling more than a thousand people, to besiege Shuyang County. They first made arrangements on the night of the 2nd, and launched at 2:00 AM. The brave county standing troops and the masses in various districts all advanced bravely. The Japanese and puppet troops in the city were awakened from their dreams by the dense artillery fire of the standing troops and others. In temporary panic, they fired cannons from the city walls towards the outside. The Chinese military and civilians were familiar with the terrain and easy to hide. After fierce fighting with the Japanese and puppet troops for seven hours, they briefly rested. At about 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, Magistrate Xia selected brave troops to launch another fierce attack on the city. They attacked from all sides simultaneously and used mortars for cover. They broke through the city walls and poured into the city at 5:00 PM. Street fighting broke out with the Japanese and puppet troops. The Chinese troops surged forward and threw hand grenades at the Japanese and puppet troops. The Japanese and puppet troops were blown up and wounded, with corpses strewn on the streets. The remaining Japanese and puppet troops could not hold on and mostly climbed onto civilian houses to resist stubbornly. The Chinese troops then surrounded, searched, and annihilated them. Many Japanese and puppet troops were killed in this battle, but detailed statistics have not yet been made. There were also heroic sacrifices on the Chinese side, but the county seat has been recovered by the Chinese military and civilians.</p>

<p>Changshu dispatch: The Dazhi Bus, operated by the Japanese, travels on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road, carrying goods and passengers. At 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, it departed from Shanghai with a United Company truck and was attacked in the Bai Mao Tai Yu Tan area of Changshu. None of the passenger or cargo vehicles escaped unscathed. The United Company truck was carrying eight pieces of tin foil from the newly opened Guangtai Tin Foil Shop in Changshu, worth 3,000 yuan, all of which were looted. The Dazhi Bus was also burned. Passengers had to transfer to an empty United Company truck to Changshu. Passengers on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road are now very cautious.</p>

<p>Suzhou dispatch: Since the fall of this city, the transportation industry has developed abnormally. The establishment of various transportation companies is almost ubiquitous. On the 8th of this month, the puppet county government, under the orders of the Japanese, jointly governed the county's transportation. All transportation companies established in the county are required to re-apply to the puppet county government for registration before the 15th. After being approved by the Japanese, the puppet county government will issue a registration certificate before they can officially operate. It is said that the Japanese military's control of transportation was initiated because the business of the transportation companies run by Japanese merchants was surpassed by the companies run by Chinese. Therefore, the Japanese merchants repeatedly requested the Japanese military to take this measure.</p>
<p>"Huaxing Bank" has recently established branches in important cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to absorb legal tender and manipulate finance. It is said that a "Huaxing" branch will also be established in this port this month. Its address has been decided to be the original site of Jiangsu Bank on Guanqian Street. A local named Xu Xun Gong has been recommended by the puppet authorities to serve as the branch manager. (Note: Xu was formerly the manager of the Avenue Joffre branch of Continental Bank in Shanghai. When the puppet provincial government was established, the preparation of the local bank failed.) It is said that all personnel and start-up procedures have now been decided. After the establishment of this branch, Suzhou's finance will probably be in danger.</p>

<p>Zhang Gang's Net Under the Pole Vault Bar, Replacing the Sandpit</p>
<p>American Veteran Coach's Invention, Records Can Reach Sixteen Feet</p>
<p>Los Angeles News: Mr. Monte Van茅, a 70-year-old veteran coach of the Southern California Athletic Association, recently, in view of the fact that world pole vaulters often suffer injuries when falling after clearing the bar, as well as the psychological impact on performance, specially proposed the use of wire mesh to replace the currently used sandpits or wood chips. It is said that with the adoption of this new method, not only will injuries be reduced, but world pole vaulting records will certainly be raised several inches or even over a foot. Mr. Van茅, in his decades of coaching experience, has witnessed pole vaulters falling and getting injured many times, such as the famous University of Southern California athlete Mido (the world pole vault record holder). Mr. Van茅 came up with an original idea, imitating the rope nets used by "flying trapeze artists" in circuses, and designed a pole vault landing net. This net has an area of ​​eight feet long and ten feet wide and is installed on a steel frame with wheels. The rope net is stretched over the steel frame, and the net is eight feet off the ground. Therefore, those who fail to clear the bar can still run under the net without accidents. Mr. Van茅 believes that after eliminating the danger of falling from a high altitude, the current world record of fourteen feet eleven and three-fifths inches will undoubtedly be raised to sixteen feet.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Postponement of the Issuance of Scrip, New Subsidiary Currency from the Ministry of Finance to Arrive Soon, Shipped from Kunming to Shanghai for Distribution by the Bank of China, Market's Subsidiary Currency Panic Expected to Be Resolved <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The copper coins and copper currency on the Shanghai market are being hoarded by unscrupulous merchants for profit, resulting in an extreme shortage. Small-value transactions in various industries are severely affected. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting prompt remedial measures.  A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Ministry of Finance, after researching and considering the supply of new copper and nickel subsidiary currency to Shanghai by the Currency Department, has reportedly agreed to hand over the coins minted by inland mints to the Central Bank for shipment to Shanghai for supply. A large batch of new subsidiary currency, including one-cent copper coins, five-cent, ten-cent, and twenty-cent nickel coins, has already been shipped from Kunming to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon and will be distributed and circulated in the Shanghai market by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank.  Efforts will be made to ship more to Shanghai continuously thereafter. Therefore, the shortage and panic of subsidiary currency in Shanghai should be resolved.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Not Yet Received a Telegram Reply</p>
<p>The shortage of copper coins and the difficult trading situation in the Shanghai market have not abated. Complaints about inconvenience are still heard everywhere. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance a few days ago, requesting prompt remedial measures. A reply telegram has not yet been received. All parties are anxiously waiting for the authorities to quickly determine remedial measures to alleviate the difficulties. Currently, stamps and revenue stamps are often used in the market for small change, and some shops have also issued their own scrip to cope with the situation. The medical, tobacco, and generally small businesses are said to be suffering the most.</p>
<p>Two Branches Suspend the Issuance of Scrip</p>
<p>The 37th Branch of the Shanghai City Association on North Fujian Road, after approving the requests of various member businesses to issue joint scrip, with each business jointly responsible for redemption, in order to provide small change and alleviate the urgent need, had resolved to issue 10,000 one-cent and 10,000 two-cent scrips, totaling 300 yuan. All the necessary printing costs were borne by the branch, with the intention of serving the member businesses. Several measures were formulated and reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that if this scrip is issued and is imitated and counterfeited by unscrupulous elements, it would create abuses. Therefore, at 6:00 PM yesterday, all member businesses were invited to explain the matter in detail. It was then decided to rescind the resolution to issue scrip. After various businesses on Xin Zha Road resolved to issue one-cent temporary scrip, representatives of various businesses gathered again at 2:00 PM yesterday. They all agreed that the government would not sit idly by regarding the difficulties caused by the lack of subsidiary currency in Shanghai, and remedial measures would likely arrive in Shanghai within a short period of time. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the issuance of joint scrip.</p>
<p>Transportation Agencies to Issue Paper Vouchers</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the tram companies in the Public Concession and the French Concession have definitely decided to print one-cent, two-cent, and three-cent paper vouchers. Although it is unknown on what date they will be issued, an employee of the tram company said that due to the urgency of the situation, the paper vouchers will be issued in the near future. Leading figures of the British Concession Public Bus Company are also considering implementing emergency measures to cope with the crisis. However, it has not yet been decided what measures will be taken. It is said that the Public Bus Company has exhausted its previous supply of fractional coins and must immediately find a replacement method.</p>
<p>Safety Campaign: Reception for Reporters, Report on Preparations, Next Week is Promotion Week</p>
<p>The Safety Campaign Committee, initiated and organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, has been preparing for nearly two months. Because various promotional activities have been prepared and are ready, the Safety Campaign Week will be implemented from June 18 to 24. Therefore, the committee's daily work is very busy. At 11:30 AM yesterday, the Safety Committee held a reception for Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters on the second floor of the Da Guangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road, displaying dozens of colorful Chinese and Western pictures printed by the committee and reporting on the progress of the preparations. Those present included Mr. Pike, Head of the Traffic Department of the Municipal Council, all Safety Executive Committee members Xiao Debo, Deler, Yin Zhiling, and Tang Guanyi, subcommittee members Zhou Bangjun and Chen Guanqin, as well as more than 100 Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters and guests. First, Chairman Xiao Debo delivered a speech, and then Secretary Bollen reported on the progress of the preparations. At the end, Western refreshments were served to the guests, and a safety campaign film was shown before the event concluded. Another report stated that the Shanghai-wide Safety Campaign Week is scheduled to officially begin on the 18th. At 11:30 AM yesterday, the organizing committee held a Safety Campaign Exhibition at the Da Guangming Cinema and hosted Chinese and foreign press. The venue displayed more than 100 kinds of Chinese and English slogans, all printed with exquisite warnings to pedestrians to be careful while walking and that safety comes first. Secretary Bollen explained the meaning of the safety campaign and the publicity plan in great detail. The Municipal Council will send a large number of promotional materials to the owners of public and private cars throughout Shanghai, including two slogans to be affixed to car windows. At that time, all public and private cars in Shanghai will be affixed with them. On the 18th, all patrolmen will be dispatched to guide pedestrians in walking. The Children's Corps will also do its best to assist. School principals are responsible for guidance, and safety films will be shown in all cinemas. This film has been rushed into production by Xinhua Film Company and will be completed soon. It is expected that the results of this safety campaign will be satisfactory, and traffic accidents on the roads in the future are expected to decrease sharply.</p>

<p>Various counties in eastern Zhejiang, such as Wenzhou, Dinghai, Haimen, Zhenhai, Xiangshan, Shaoxing, and Cixi, have successively suffered from the atrocities and indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes, killing innocent people. Ningbo has suffered the most severe damage. According to news from the aviation industry, at 9:25 AM on the 12th, two Japanese naval aircraft intruded into the airspace over Yuyao and dropped six bombs in the commercial district, destroying more than sixty civilian houses and killing and injuring more than twenty civilians. Yuyao is a small town in Zhejiang Province with no military facilities. However, Japanese planes wantonly bombed it to indulge in their cruelty. This will only arouse more people's enmity and shared hatred.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Japanese Authorities Issue a Proclamation, Advising Japanese Residents to Be Cautious in Their Words and Deeds, Seeking Solutions to Issues in the Concessions, Japanese Residents Not Yet Moving North of the Suzhou Creek <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that the Japanese Army, Navy, and diplomatic authorities issued a joint proclamation yesterday (the 10th), urging Japanese residents in Shanghai to exercise patience and be cautious in their words and deeds when seeking solutions to various issues involving the Public Concession and the French Concession here, and to trust the wisdom and power of the authorities. The proclamation mentioned the situation in the Xiamen Public Concession's Gulangyu and the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. Gulangyu and Tianjin Concessions</p>
<p>Recent Disputes</p>
<p>Have not been resolved, and the world is paying close attention to them. Anti-Japanese activities in Shanghai have gradually decreased, but efforts are still needed to achieve a fundamental solution to the issues involving the two concessions. Regarding this, the Japanese authorities are now making preparations to implement their best possible methods. We are well aware that Japanese residents in this city are becoming impatient with the daily problems they encounter in the two concessions. However, they must</p>
<p>Be Cautious in Their Words and Deeds</p>
<p>and express their trust in the wisdom and power of the authorities. Under the current circumstances, we sincerely hope that Japanese residents will act with self-respect, strive for self-improvement, and contribute to achieving the goals of the "Holy War." Also, the Xin Sheng News Agency reported on Tuesday that local Japanese authorities issued a secret order on the 13th, notifying Japanese residents living south of the Suzhou Creek to move quickly to</p>
<p>North of the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>Anyone who violates this order will be punished by having their passport revoked. A Japanese spokesman replied at a reception for foreign reporters that he had not received such a notice and had no knowledge of it. The claim that Japanese residents are moving back to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek is merely a rumor.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Abnormal Price Hikes, Affecting Social Tranquility, Price Increases Unrelated to Foreign Exchange Should Be Corrected, The Lives of Commoners and Coolies Become Increasingly Difficult <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's prices, which normally have considerable connections with various parts of the country, and Shanghai being the national commercial center and distribution hub for import and export goods, its fluctuations are highly valued. After the war, Shanghai's prices have been rising abnormally due to abnormal supply and demand, and the government's control of foreign exchange, causing drastic changes in the black market foreign exchange rates, which have greatly affected the livelihood of citizens. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Soaring Situation is Quite Alarming</p>
<p>After the war, agricultural products, industrial products, and mineral products have all tended to rise. (1) Agricultural products with an increase of over 100% include tea, gallnuts, and tobacco leaves. Those with an increase of over 50% include tung oil, red sorghum, raw silk, timber, and corn. Those with an increase of over 30% include cotton, peanut oil, sesame, and yellow cattle hides. Those with an increase of less than 26% include Saigon rice, white japonica rice, wheat, soybeans, dried cocoons, pig bristles, edible salt, and raw oil. (2) Industrial products such as flour, cotton yarn, cloth, silk, paper, hardware, cement, pigments, and chemical raw materials have all tended to rise. Imported goods such as pigments, chemical raw materials, hardware, and newsprint have seen the most significant increases. Cotton yarn and cloth have also risen sharply. The reasons are increased ocean freight rates and the tightening of the black market foreign exchange rates, resulting in higher costs. (3) Mineral products that are widely used and relatively important, such as coal, mineral oil, copper, iron, pots, lead, antimony, etc., have seen coal rise by more than 100%. Coal is a daily necessity for industry and households. The price of oil has soared due to the tightening of the black market foreign exchange rates. Other mineral products have also risen successively due to transportation factors, by about 30% to 50%.</p>
<p>Various Manufacturers Have Also Revised New Prices</p>
<p>Due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the soaring of raw materials, various industries in Shanghai have announced increases in selling prices. Yesterday, various manufacturers continued to revise their new prices, including (1) Shanghai Brewery Company, (2) Ewo Brewery Company, (3) Amoy Canning Corporation (梅林罐頭食品公司), (4) Ting Tze Kee Eagle Brand Magnetic Ink, (5) Da Feng Leather Factory, (6) Jian Chen Foreign Firm Leather Department, (7) White Girl Fragrant Powder, (8) Biao Yong An Tang Wan Jin You, (9) Wang He Xing Zipper Factory, (10) Doctor Fountain Pen, (11) Guan Le Ming Fountain Pen Company, (12) Shanghai Wire Factory, (13) Purui Industrial Cooperative, (14) China Chemical Industrial Society, (15) China Tin Foil Factory, (16) Ci Feng Vehicle Parts Factory, (17) Various Factories Affiliated with the Vacuum Bottle Trade Association, (18) Various Businesses Affiliated with the Woolen Goods Trade Association, (19) Hua Sheng Thread Factory, etc. It is found that various industries generally unrelated to foreign exchange are also taking the opportunity to raise prices. If this is not quickly curbed, the lives of commoners and coolies will become unbearable, and its impact on social tranquility will be profound and immense. Powerful groups should jointly seek effective measures to deal with this.</p>
<p>Merchants Manipulating, Threatening Civilians</p>
<p>The black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has shrunk from 8.25 pence to 6.5 pence since the 7th of this month due to the adjustment of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee and the restriction of supply by HSBC and other banks. The cost of imported goods has soared, and selling prices have been raised one after another, including enamelware, leather, vacuum bottles, pigments, coal balls, wire, glass, paint, tin foil, Western medicine, cosmetics, rubber, soap, nails, beer, rental cars, foreign paper, woolen cloth, fabrics, yarn, cigarettes, printing ink, hardware, machinery, coal, and oil wax, etc. However, raw silk, domestic rice, miscellaneous grains, and domestic food products, which are not related to the tightening of foreign exchange, have also increased in price. Among them, there are inevitably speculative merchants attempting to manipulate prices for huge profits. The increase in domestic rice is not far from the price during the winter of 1937 when the war first broke out. Furthermore, Shanghai has sufficient rice reserves and there is no reason for soaring prices. This is clearly the manipulation of speculative merchants. If measures are not taken to stop it, it will inevitably affect the people's livelihood greatly.</p>
<p>Workers' Lives Gradually Becoming Difficult</p>
<p>Abnormal price hikes have led to an increase in the cost of living, which has greatly affected people's livelihood. The following is a record of the workers' cost of living index. For example, if the index in 1926 is taken as the base number of 100%, then in 1938, food is 129.47%, rent is 289.14%, clothing is 126.54%, fuel and lighting is 242.59%, miscellaneous items are 164.20%, and the total index is 160.62. The above index is the highest number since 1926. Since the soaring prices, there has been a huge increase.</p>
<p>Various Sectors Anxiously Hoping for Stabilization</p>
<p>In order to stabilize the prices of daily necessities in various places and crack down on speculation and manipulation, the National Government has promulgated the "Measures for Assessing Prices and Cracking Down on Speculation and Manipulation in Times of Emergency," requiring relevant agencies, chambers of commerce, and trade associations of daily necessities in various places to establish a Fair Price Committee to handle the fair pricing of local daily necessities. All major cities across the country have successively established such committees. However, the situation in Shanghai is special. If a Fair Price Committee is established, there will be many difficulties in implementing crackdowns. Although some people hope that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce will work with various trade associations to assess the prices of daily necessities and crack down on speculators' manipulation, various trade associations believe that there are factual difficulties. Regarding the soaring prices in the concessions, it is hoped that the Public Concession and French Concession authorities will properly plan effective measures to deal with it. Regarding the food-related industries, special attention should be paid to selling prices to avoid affecting the livelihood of citizens.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Detailed Testimony of the Witness: Ding Gerle's Tragic Death. British Coroner Holds Two Hearings Yesterday and Today. Ding's Abdomen Stabbed Deeply to the Tenth Degree. <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Early Surgery Could Have Saved Him.</p>
<p>The Zi Lin News reported that the case of Ding Gerle, a supervisor at the Lun Chang Textile Factory, who was stabbed to death by a Japanese marine on June 6, was continued yesterday (the 14th) afternoon by the British coroner Haines. The first witness, Dr. Kirk, told the coroner that at around 11 PM on June 6, he was summoned by motorboat to the Japanese military hospital in Pudong to see Ding Gerle. Ding's condition was very bad, covered in cold sweat, with cold hands and a barely perceptible pulse. He knew that Ding had serious internal injuries and that the only hope was to perform surgery as soon as possible to treat the internal injuries. So, he was transported to the Customs Wharf and then to the Country Hospital. By the time they arrived, it was around 11:40 PM. The witness, together with Dr. Sun Speck and two surgeons from the Marine Corps, began surgery, opening the abdomen and examining the intestines. They found several stab wounds and sutured them. The injured person lost a lot of blood. The surgery was completed at about 2:15 AM on the 7th. At that time, Mr. Ding's pulse was very weak. He died at 5:30 AM that morning. Mr. Ding had a laceration on his head, a stab wound on his right hip, and a stab wound under his left rib. There were also numerous scars on his hands and forearms. There was only one superficial wound. Medical and surgical books all state that such injuries have a better chance of healing the sooner surgery is performed. According to the witness, most of the injuries were to the small intestine. Injuries to the large intestine are not easily fatal. If surgery had been performed earlier, there would have been a very good chance of recovery.</p>
<p>A Report from the Country Hospital</p>
<p>Next, Dr. Andersen of the Country Hospital, who examined Mr. Ding's body on the 7th, submitted a report to the examiner, revealing that there were wounds on the left arm and shoulder, the right forearm and hand, and the right leg. There were drag marks on the back. The right and left sides of the abdomen, the right hip, the right thigh, and the abdomen were all stabbed. The abdominal wounds were 8 to 10 inches long. Internal examination revealed that the abdominal cavity was stabbed in two places and the intestines were punctured in many places. The areas around the wounds began to inflame. The shock and bleeding from the abdominal stabs were the cause of death. There were a total of five stab wounds caused by the same type or same instrument. The stabbing force was very strong. The marks on the back were caused by Mr. Ding being dragged along the road.</p>
<p>The Circumstances Vividly Described</p>
<p>Bai Langjin, a clerk at the Lun Chang Textile Factory, told the coroner that at 8 AM on June 6, he looked out from the window of the bathroom and saw several Japanese marines rushing to the Lun Chang Company's floating pier, where there was a group of Chinese, some of whom were holding sticks. They were all taken by the Japanese soldiers, entered the textile factory compound through the main gate, and stopped ten yards from the office. Several Chinese people suddenly ran towards the power room. The witness put on his clothes and went downstairs and saw Mr. Ding Gerle holding a Mauser pistol and walking towards the Japanese soldiers and the Chinese people. The witness returned upstairs to his room and looked out the window and saw Mr. Ding and two Japanese soldiers wrestling. Then he pushed one Japanese soldier away with his left hand, turned around, fired a shot into the ground, and walked back to the office. When the witness went downstairs, Mr. Ding was ten to fifteen yards from the office. Japanese reinforcements had arrived. Mr. Ding seemed increasingly angry and occasionally pointed his gun at the Japanese soldiers and officers. Lun Chang employees Sharp Er Scott and Que Tehui Ke and others were standing next to the Japanese soldiers, repeatedly advising Mr. Ding to take a more reasonable attitude. The Japanese soldiers surrounded the office with live ammunition and fixed bayonets. About ten other Japanese soldiers surrounded Mr. Ding and Mr. Xia and others. Then one Japanese soldier jumped on Mr. Ding's back and knocked his pistol to the ground. Mr. Ding tried to grab the pistol, and several Japanese soldiers began to stab and hit Mr. Ding with their bayonets and rifle butts. The witness saw Mr. Ding fall to the ground at one point. The Japanese soldiers seemed to continue stabbing and hitting him. When he stood up, Mr. Xia and Mr. Que tried to push the Japanese soldiers aside. A few seconds later, Mr. Ding was dragged out by a group of Japanese soldiers. At that time, Mr. Ding's blood was gushing out, and his outer clothing was completely red. Mr. Xia shouted to the witness and the other two to come to their aid. Just as they were about to go, they were stopped by the Japanese soldiers. Mr. Ding was dragged on the ground to the back of the factory, about thirty yards. Mr. Xia and Er followed behind. The next time he saw Mr. Ding, he was walking. The coroner asked if Mr. Ding had dropped his gun on the ground. The witness replied, "Indeed. Mr. Ding did not fire a single shot at anyone. At that time, there were two Japanese soldiers near Mr. Ding, and another Japanese soldier was about ten yards away."</p>
<p>Lun Chang Supervisor's Testimony of What He Saw</p>
<p>Xia Pu Er, the spinning department supervisor of Lun Chang Factory, said that at about 6:00 AM on June 6, the witness was having breakfast when a disturbance occurred on the floating pier. He looked out of the window from the south side of the factory and saw a group of coolies walking towards the power room, followed by two Japanese soldiers, leisurely walking in the same direction. The witness and Scott ran upstairs to Ding Gerle's room to ask for a gun. Mr. Ding handed Mr. Shi the key for the gun, while preparing his own Mauser pistol. The witness and Shi took the gun, with the witness leaving the room last, running towards the office. About halfway there, he heard a gunshot. When he arrived at the location of the Japanese soldiers and Chinese people, Que had also arrived. The two attempted to explain to the Japanese junior officer that Ding Gerle was arriving from the factory with blood flowing from his mouth and his gun was lost. At this point, Coroner Haines adjourned the court and adjourned the questioning until 10:00 AM this morning (the 15th).</p>
<p>Japanese Doctors Failed to Provide Careful Treatment</p>
<p>The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reports,</p>
<p>British Coroner Haines convened court this morning (the 15th) to continue the hearing on the Ding Gerle case. Mr. Xia Pu said that after Mr. Ding was injured, he accompanied him to the Japanese military hospital in Pudong. According to the Japanese doctor who treated Mr. Ding, Mr. Ding had only suffered superficial injuries. The largest wound did not reach his stomach, and he would recover soon. While Mr. Ding was receiving medical treatment, he said that his stomach was in pain, but the Japanese doctor, although he understood English, did not pay attention to Mr. Ding's words and bound him with bandages. Then, they left Mr. Ding and Mr. Xia inside. Mr. Ding still said that his stomach was in pain. At 12:00 noon, Mr. Ding's condition seemed to worsen. Mr. Xia wanted to ask the Japanese doctor to come again, but he could not because he was having lunch. At 12:45 PM, the Japanese doctor finally arrived, gave Mr. Ding a sleeping pill. At 2:30 PM, he obtained permission from the Japanese side to leave the hospital and reported the matter to the factory. Mr. Xia testified earlier that when Major Nogi arrived at the scene, Ding Gerle, Que Tehui Ke, Shi Scott, and himself were surrounded by Japanese marines. Mr. Ding threatened Nogi with his gun, urging him to order the Japanese soldiers to leave the factory. Nogi retreated, and the witness stepped forward to explain the situation. During the conversation, another disturbance arose. He saw Mr. Ding kneeling on one knee, being beaten with rifle butts by several Japanese soldiers. The witness ran to call for the Japanese soldiers to stop. Major Nogi also approached Mr. Ding and struck him three or four times. The witness pleaded with him to stop. The Japanese soldiers then dragged Mr. Ding twenty-five yards on the ground. The witness asked Nogi where he was dragging Mr. Ding. He replied that he was going to the hospital. At that time, Mr. Ding had gotten up and was walking, with the witness and a Japanese soldier escorting him to the hospital. When court opened this morning, there was only one witness, Mr. Xia. The coroner then adjourned the court and adjourned the hearing until 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 16th).</p>
<h3 id="e40">The Puppet Organization Again Attempts to Intervene: Fruits, Local Products, and Nutrition. Organization of the "Fresh Fruit and Local Products Market Association." Trade Union Resolves to Unanimously Refuse to Participate. <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fruit and Local Products Trade Union held a meeting yesterday and firmly opposed the so-called "Shanghai Central Fresh Fruit and Local Products Market Association." All members unanimously refused to participate and signed oaths of opposition. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attempt to Control</p>
<p>The fruit and local products industry is located in the Shiliupu Laozha Bridge area, with about fifty firms in the entire industry. After the war, some firms stopped operating. However, fruits and local products are essential foods for daily use. Their sources, in addition to transportation and sales from the suburbs of Songhu, are also purchased from foreign countries and various places in Fujian, Guangdong, and Tianjin. Now, they have aroused the covetousness of the "Renovation," attempting to establish a company to control them. The name is "Shanghai Central Fresh Fruit and Local Products Market Association." Luring the scum of the industry, it is presided over by Japanese named Niwa Atsushi and Fujiwara Ueno, with a capital of one million yuan. The main market will be located at the old site of the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei, and branch markets are planned to be established in Shiliupu, Laozha Bridge, Caojiadu, and Xujiahui.</p>
<p>Resolution to Oppose</p>
<p>The industry's trade union has resolutely decided not to cooperate with the above organization and held a general membership meeting yesterday. More than fifty companies, including Xie Yuan and Xie Feng, were present. Chaired by Xu Runsheng, they discussed countermeasures and resolved that all members would unanimously refuse to participate and signed oaths of opposition to show their determination. It is heard that the so-called "Fresh Fruit and Local Products Market" will use the scum of the industry to win over the industry. Except for a few who agree, the rest unanimously refused. Therefore, it is still difficult to predict whether the "market" will be established at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e41">The Stabilization Committee Continues to Supply. The Foreign Exchange Fund is Solid. Suppressing the Black Market Exchange Rate and Correcting Trade. The Bank of China Continues to Supply Legal Foreign Exchange. <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee adjusted the foreign exchange on the black market, the foreign exchange on the Shanghai black market has suddenly plummeted. Those who seek advantages by causing disturbances are spreading rumors to confuse the public, speculators are taking the opportunity to act, and those with superficial knowledge and no fixed opinions are worried and panicked. People are agitated, and the market situation is turbulent. Now, the supply of foreign exchange is gradually increasing, and the situation is improving. The only difference is that the black market exchange rate has tightened. The rumor that the Stabilization Committee's fund has been used up can be dispelled by the current continuing supply.</p>
<p>Moreover, the maintenance of the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai only benefits those who have a direct relationship with the black market. On the other hand, there are those who fulfill their obligations and make sacrifices, that is, the backbone of the Chinese government and the people who need foreign exchange, the importers of foreign goods, those who evade domestic funds, and those who purchase counterfeit money. All of these have many conflicts with national interests. However, in consideration of the complex history and environment of the past, Shanghai still allows it to operate freely on a large scale in secret, and the black market can exist. However, it is not this black market that represents the status of Chinese legal tender. The statutory standard of one shilling and two and a half pence has never been changed by the Central Bank. That is, for legitimate foreign exchange needs, it has always been supplied at the legal price.</p>
<p>There are many strategies to maintain this barrier, but trade adjustment is the main one. The government's policy is to maintain the interests of friendly countries' trade and at the same time strive for trade balance. The fact is very clear. Each of the non-occupied ports has changed from trade deficit to trade surplus. With smooth trade, the exchange market is easy to maintain. In addition, with cautious issuance policies, the normal ratio of materials and currency is not disrupted by changes in quantity. With the original gold reserves and newly obtained loans, the external position of legal tender has been strengthened. However, in the occupied areas, due to the government's lack of authority, the trade deficit has increased sharply and trade has deteriorated. In addition, the purchase of "joint coupons" and "Chinese coupons" has inevitably softened the black market exchange rate. In this environment, if the supply of funds continues at a higher exchange rate, would it not only increase unnecessary sacrifices? Therefore, indirectly suppressing the black market exchange rate to correct the trade situation, or worrying about rising prices due to the reduction of the black market exchange rate, but it must be known that the so-called reduction here refers to the black market. Legitimate necessities from foreign countries are still supplied at the normal price of one shilling and two and a half pence.</p>

<p>The Continental News reported that the "Shanghai Municipal Government," through the White Russian Emigration Committee, issued an order requesting that White Russian professional groups, and even cultural groups, register with the White Russian Emigration Committee. As a result, the National Committee of the White Russian Emigration Federation announced its liquidation yesterday (the 14th). At the same time, it was heard from reliable sources that the Russian Veterans General Assembly on Lafayette Road, the Khabarovsk Military Academy Student Union, and other White Russian groups refused to comply with this order. The Russian National General Assembly here decided to respond to the request and submit a list of its members to the White Russian Emigration Committee and the "Shanghai Municipal Government."

<h3 id="e43">The Municipal Council Will Adopt Stern Measures Against the "Badlands" of Western Shanghai. If They Do Not Close, They Will Block Traffic into the Settlement. Once Strictly Enforced, the Gambling Dens' Business Will Plummet. <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Hollywood Gambling Dens Earn Huge Profits</p>
<p>The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that it is rumored that the Public Concession Municipal Council, backed by the British and American authorities, has unofficially "indicated" to the operators of various gambling dens in the "badlands of Western Shanghai" that they must close their gambling dens. Otherwise, obstacles will be placed, completely blocking their access to the Public Concession. The owners of various gambling dens are very concerned and are seriously considering moving to the interior, reopening in Wuxi, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and Nanjing. However, the profits in the interior are not as high as in Shanghai, so they seem unwilling to move.</p>
<p>It is heard that although Hollywood Amusement Park has paid huge sums in recent months, such as license fees, "protection" fees, and "pacification" fees, its profits have reached as much as four million yuan. The gambling den has a large-scale roulette, so its revenue is very large. The operators of various gambling dens are now discussing the possibility of the Municipal Council taking more stern measures. Although most gambling dens can enter the interior from the "Avenue" area, the Police Department can block their entrances into the Settlement and ultimately search all people coming from the "badlands" area, making it very inconvenient for gamblers, so they do not go to the gambling dens. Those who ride in cars after curfew without a pass can be detained in the police station.</p>
<p>Even those who have passes and frequently frequent gambling dens may have their passes revoked. The "badlands" gambling den owners also believe that the Police Department can take some other measures. If strictly enforced, the prosperous business of the gambling dens will plummet and will not be able to recover. The same is true for opium dens. If the Police Department searches people coming from the "opium area" in the suburbs of Shanghai, it can destroy the opium business, and it will surely find many people carrying opium, red pills, and other drugs. Furthermore, international condemnation of the drug situation in the Japanese-occupied areas has greatly damaged the reputation of Japan and its puppet Nanjing regime. Therefore, the "Renovation Government" is reforming its "anti-drug" policy. The new "anti-drug rules" will be implemented soon, stipulating that opium dens will be divided into three classes according to size. In first-class opium dens, each pipe will be taxed six cents per day, five cents for second-class, and four cents for third-class, which is higher than the old tax. In addition to paying official taxes, opium den operators must also pay "protection fees" to local thugs to ensure the safety of their business and transportation of soil. The "Renovation Government" promises to implement the new regulations and eliminate extortionists in the "badlands," but opium den operators are quite suspicious of the value of this promise, fearing that the "Renovation Government" will demand even greater taxes when "pacifying the badlands."</p>
<p>They also believe that this move is nothing less than "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs." At the same time, soil merchants are also deeply afraid of "white and red enemies," because the sales of heroin and red pills are harmful to the "black goods" business. On the surface, Japanese are not allowed to go to Xinkang Li and Bailinan Road Wujiaochang and other places where opium dens and second-class gambling dens are located, but recently, more and more Japanese have been going to these places to take drugs, gamble, or sightsee.</p>

The police station reported to the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special Court and forensic doctors to come to the institute to examine the body. As there were no family members in Shanghai, after the investigating detective reported the case investigation process, the official ordered the autopsy to confirm that Li Tianzhu and Xu Yuanzhen died from gunshot wounds. The bodies were handed over to the charity hall for burial. The murderers will be arrested and handed over to the police department for handling. As for the issue of funeral clothing and coffins for the two bodies, if it is determined that they died in the line of duty, the directors of a certain charity hall will decide to allocate funds from the charity fund for clothing, coffins, and burial. The investigation and decision are still in progress.</p>

<p>The People of Wusong and Baoshan Rise Up to Defend Themselves. Their Strength is Great and They Repeatedly Launch Successful Attacks.</p>
<p>The people of Wusong and Baoshan, unable to endure the oppression, have risen up to defend themselves. In the area, because it was the area of ​​the Battle of Shanghai, there are quite a few firearms scattered in the fields. Therefore, they took the opportunity to dig them out and organized them into guerrilla teams. The name is tentatively set as the People's Self-Defense Army. Its scope starts from Wusong, and all of Yanghang, Liuhang, Luodian, Dachang, and turns to the Jiangwan area and is active near the puppet "Municipal Government" and Hongkou. Although the organization has not been around for long, it has already attacked Baoshan City three times, burned the Japanese military camp in Yanghang, demolished the Japanese military highway in Jiangwan, and destroyed the Japanese military wireless radio station in Dachang. The Japanese army repeatedly resolved to attack, but suffered damage and were exhausted from running around. Therefore, the important strongholds in these areas have been occupied by these armed people. The Japanese army only maintains the transportation arteries from Hongkou to Wusong, withdrawing and concentrating to protect their strength. It is heard that the armed people are now being led and trained by officers from Chinese military authorities such as the Third War Zone Guerrilla Headquarters and the New Fourth Army Department.</p>

<p>Young Woman Checks In</p>
<p>The New Hui Zhong Inn, located where Hubei Road, Daxin Street, and Hankou Road meet, is known for its elegant interior and attentive service. As a result, it is a popular choice for the middle and upper classes, and its business is booming. The day before yesterday (the 13th), a modern young woman (approaching her prime) arrived at the inn and booked Room 412, paying a daily rate of $2.80. She paid $7 in national currency and then went out. She didn't return until about 7:00 PM that evening, accompanied by a man.</p>
<p>Playful Banter</p>
<p>The man was dressed in a light gray suit, leather shoes, and a straw hat. He appeared affluent and signed the register as Zhang Zhiwen, 39 years old, speaking with a local accent, and identified himself as a businessman. After having dinner, the night shift tea server noticed the man and woman in the room engaging in playful banter. Around 11:00 PM, Zhang closed the door to go to sleep and instructed the tea server to wake them up at 10:00 AM the next morning. The tea server, suspecting nothing, complied and left.</p>
<p>Discovery of the Tragedy</p>
<p>The next morning, around 10:00 AM, the tea server knocked on the door of Room 412, but there was no response after a long time. Suspicion arose. When they managed to enter the room, they saw the modern young woman lying naked on the bed, blood flowing from her mouth. Upon examination, she was found to be dead. Zhang was lying on the bed, barely breathing. A bottle of empty poison was on the table, indicating that the man and woman had taken poison.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Suicide</p>
<p>The tea server immediately ran out to report to the front desk, who then wired the Old Zha gate police station. Officer No. 260 rushed to the scene and summoned an ambulance. Zhang was rushed to Renji Hospital, but he succumbed to the excessive poison and died at 3:40 PM that afternoon. The woman's body was sent to the coroner's office. Reporters investigated the incident afterward and learned the circumstances of the man and woman's suicide. The woman was already married, the man already had a wife. Due to intense illicit love, unable to fulfill the wish of growing old together, they resorted to this desperate measure.</p>
<p>Cotton Bale Crushes a Boy to Death, Another Severely Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 4:30 PM, a truck belonging to the Japanese-owned Tongxing Cotton Mill, license plate number 23352, was traveling along Jisi Fei'er Road near Jinjia Lane. At that time, two children were playing by the side of the road. One was Qiang Sangou, 10 years old, residing at 5 Jinjia Lane, and the other was Zhang Jingxing, 7 years old. As the truck passed by, the road was uneven, and the jolting caused a large bale of cotton to fall off the truck, crushing the two children. Sangou sustained chest injuries and was barely breathing, while Jingxing injured his legs. The police arrived at the scene and took them to the hospital for treatment. Sangou eventually died from his injuries.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Finance: Foreign Exchange Increasingly Stable, Cash Market Returns to Normal <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The spot gold (烚赤) gray market situation yesterday saw a gradual decrease in the range of fluctuations, mainly due to observations that foreign exchange would not undergo alarming changes in the near future. Considering the uneasy situation in Tianjin and Gulangyu, most operators were cautious. However, the situation was difficult to predict, with the overall trend hovering around 2,590 yuan. This was because certain gold shops and wealthy individuals in the market maintained strong bullish sentiment and bought on dips. However, securities firms and cash shops took advantage of the high prices to take profits, resulting in uncertain fluctuations and, ultimately, no clear winners or losers. Trading also became light, with only about a thousand taels traded throughout the day. There was also no change in gold jewelry prices. It was heard that 200 to 300 taels of gold jewelry were arriving in Shanghai daily from various regions and occupied areas. Customs gold remained unchanged, while British pure gold, etc., rebounded and increased.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Gray Market Neither Flourishes nor Declines</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened with a certain gold shop continuously absorbing supplies on behalf of speculators, and it was heard that the market was relatively stable. At 9:40 AM, the market opened eight yuan higher. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from a securities firm at a price of 2,593 yuan. Subsequently, due to the strong selling pressure from the securities firm, prices gradually declined. The securities firm sold a total of 100 taels to a certain gold shop at prices of 92 yuan and 91 yuan. Later, a certain cash shop also started selling, and the market became increasingly weak under the double selling pressure, breaking below the 90 yuan level. Soon, it dropped by eight yuan. The cash shop sold 50 taels each to a certain money exchange and a certain gold shop, both at a price of 83 yuan. Then, it sold another 100 taels to a certain money exchange at prices of 82 yuan and 81 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop took advantage of the low prices to buy again, and the price rebounded immediately. The gold shop bought 50 taels from a cash shop at a price of 84 yuan, and another 50 taels from a money exchange at 86 yuan. At 11:45 AM, a money exchange bought 50 taels from another cash shop at 88 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, a certain silver shop suddenly became interested in buying, causing the market to open three yuan higher. The Shou Shan cash shop sold 50 taels to a silver shop at a price of 91 yuan. Then, a certain silver shop absorbed 50 taels from a money exchange at a price of 94 yuan. At this time, a certain gold shop (on behalf of the Hua Nan gang) came to take profits, and the upward trend immediately stopped, turning downward. The money exchange sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop at a price of 91 yuan. A certain Yu shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange at a price of 88 yuan. At this time, the securities firm also came to sell again, and the market became increasingly weak, selling 50 taels to a certain gold shop (on behalf of speculators) at a price of 86 yuan. Later, it dropped by another four yuan. The securities firm sold 50 taels to a gold shop at a price of 82 yuan. After that, the selling interest faded, causing a slight rebound. The money exchange bought 50 taels from a silver shop at 2,585 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session. As a result, there was neither flourishing nor decline compared to the previous evening's closing price. The fluctuation throughout the day was only 13 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was 2,595 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,575 yuan. The current markup for gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed price. According to inquiries, there is very little price manipulation.</p>
<p>No Changes in Gold Jewelry</p>
<p>Because the spot gold market showed a fluctuating trend, silver shops made no changes to the selling price of gold jewelry, with Da Tong Hang remaining at 263 yuan and Xin Tong Hang at 261 yuan. The purchase price was 255 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Rebounds by One Penny</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch on the 14th, British pure gold rebounded by one penny per ounce due to the weakening of the British pound, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, and five pence. As a result, the People's Bank of China's cash purchase price also rebounded to 1,213 yuan and six jiao. The listed price of Customs gold remained unchanged at two yuan, three jiao, nine fen, and four li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by seven jiao, reaching 1,206 yuan and nine jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Chinese Merchants' Resale of Foreign Exchange Is Relatively Active; Japanese Banks Again Drop in Spot <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Foreign exchange market conditions yesterday saw HSBC announce its listing prices, with only the Indian exchange shrinking by 125, and all others remaining unchanged. In the gray market, the Japanese bank suddenly re-released the July futures that had been settled in the past few days and dropped them in spot, because they were again collecting large amounts of legal tender in the occupied areas. Foreign firms were actively settling spot transactions, but foreign banks were still willing to maintain prices. In addition, due to the rising interbank lending rates, Chinese banks were particularly willing to sell, further stabilizing the market. Foreign firms with futures were also good at absorbing cheap supplies, resulting in an extremely mediocre underlying trend. As a result, spot prices showed the British pound as unchanged and the U.S. dollar as slightly firm, while futures prices were unchanged. Trading was still active throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong exchange, the foreign banks' supply was still strong, so the situation continued to weaken.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Compete to Settle Transactions</p>
<p>In the morning, the London bulk rate was initially reduced by .0625 for near-term contracts, while long-term contracts remained unchanged. The New York silver price was stable, London gold rebounded by one penny, and the exchange rate of British pounds to U.S. dollars was down by 1.9, unchanged against Shanghai and France. The U.S. dollar was down by .25 against the British pound, unchanged against Shanghai, and down by .0625 against France. The central government's listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. The banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 6.5 pence for British pounds and 12.625 yuan for U.S. dollars, unchanged from the previous close for British pounds and up by .03125 for U.S. dollars. After the opening, foreign firms and Japanese banks competed to aggressively buy spot British pounds and U.S. dollars, but since Chinese and foreign banks were still willing to sell, the underlying trend was relatively flat. Foreign firms and Japanese banks (brokers) successively bought spot British pounds from foreign banks HSBC, Mckellar and Chinese banks Shanghai at 6.5 pence, and then settled spot U.S. dollars from Chinese-Belgian bank at 12.625 yuan. The balance tax for silver was announced with a continued increase of .5 fen, calculated at 4.50 percent. At that time, overseas Chinese sold July British pounds to counterparties at 6.375 pence. Subsequently, the Japanese bank (through brokers) also sold July British pounds to Yuri at 6.375 pence, and also sold July U.S. dollars to Chinese-Belgian at 12.4375 yuan, presenting a flat-to-firm trend. However, it soon rebounded. Near noon, a foreign firm sold spot Hong Kong dollars to a money exchange at 43.5 yuan, and the situation was also slightly firm. By the afternoon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 6.5 pence for British pounds and 12.65625 yuan for U.S. dollars, the same as the morning opening.</p>
<p>Result: British Pound Unchanged, U.S. Dollar Slightly Weak</p>
<p>In the afternoon, although foreign firms continued to settle transactions, the market showed little change because foreign banks' supply was still good and Chinese banks' willingness to sell was increasing. Foreign firms first settled spot British pounds from foreign banks HSBC, Mckellar, a certain bank, and Chinese banks Zhongnan Shanghai at 6.5 pence, and then spot U.S. dollars at 12.65625 yuan. Subsequently, Chinese banks mutually conducted July British pound transactions at 6.375 pence. Later, the foreign bank Dutch sold spot Hong Kong dollars to foreign firms at 43.5 yuan, with a flat situation. By the evening close, the banks' spot selling prices were 6.5 pence for British pounds and 12.625 yuan for U.S. dollars. The results showed the British pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar up by .03125. Hong Kong exchange rate, after accounting for transactions, continued to weaken by .125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Weakens in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Hong</p>
<p>Kong, 15th: The exchange market was stable at the opening this morning, with no changes in U.S. dollars, British pounds, or Japanese yen. The Shanghai exchange rate, however, shrunk by two yuan to 227 yuan. At 11:30 AM, there were no changes, but the market atmosphere softened at the morning close. British pounds shrunk by .03125, with the spot rate at one shilling, two pence, and eight one two five, and the forward rate at one shilling, two pence, and seven eight one two five. U.S. dollars shrunk by .125, with the spot rate at twenty-eight yuan eight seven five, and the forward rate shrinking by .0625 to twenty-eight yuan eight one two five. The Japanese yen shrank by .25 to 105.75 yuan. The closing market in the afternoon continued to contract. The British exchange rate shrunk again by .03125, the U.S. exchange rate shrunk again by .0625, and the Japanese exchange rate also shrunk by .25.</p>
<p>Many Foreign Currencies Are Firm and Popular</p>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose by one penny, and the British-U.S. exchange rate fell by .25. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were eagerly settling payments, and foreign banks provided ample supply. The Hong Kong telegraph supply was also abundant. As a result, the British pound was flat and the U.S. dollar weakened by .03125. At the opening of the spot gold market, prices rose by eight yuan. Long positions closed out to take profits, and the market softened slightly. In the afternoon, due to the serious situation in Britain and Japan, money exchanges provided supplies, and the market price eventually returned to 2,585 yuan at the evening close, the same as the previous day. The supply and demand of British and U.S. dollars and gold pounds was relatively balanced, but the demand for U.S. gold pounds was higher, and the prices were expensive. The demand for British gold notes was very strong and continued to be firm. The supply of U.S. gold notes was abundant due to the loosening of exchange rates, so the prices were downstream. The demand for French franc notes was rare, and the prices fell slightly. The demand for Singapore notes, rupee notes, and Canadian notes was strong, but the supply was not smooth, so they tended to be firm and expensive. The supply of Japanese gold notes became scarce, and the market price was firm, with the evening market priced in legal tender. Korean notes, on the other hand, were weak due to rare demand, with the evening market at 8 jiao, 4 fen, and 2 li. Transactions in the guild were still active. Jin Da sold and Yong Tai bought 100 units of U.S. gold pounds, Hui Tong sold and Yong Tai bought 40 units of U.S. gold pounds, Qin Tai sold and Fukan bought 50 pounds of British gold notes, and Yong Feng sold and Xin Tai bought 1,000 yuan of U.S. gold notes, Bao Xiang sold and Tong Feng bought 300 yuan of Hong Kong notes. Yesterday's market prices: British gold notes rose by 2 fen, U.S. gold pounds rose by 1 jiao, U.S. dollars fell by 1 fen and 3 li, French franc notes fell by 1 li, Singapore notes rose by 1 fen, rupee notes, Canadian notes, and Philippine notes all rose by 2 fen, German gold notes rose by 1 jiao, Australian gold notes rose by 3 jiao and 1. All other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Discount Rate at 51 Yuan, Interbank Lending Rate Reaches 2 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts suddenly became high, rising from 50 yuan and 2 jiao per thousand yuan in the morning to 51 yuan near noon, and then leveled off in the afternoon, 7 jiao and 5 higher than the previous day. The interbank lending rate also rose to 2 jiao, up by 2 fen from the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Securities: Interbank Lending Rate Rises Daily; Bond Market Becomes Increasingly Weak; Decline in Foreign Stocks Is Frightening <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The securities gray market situation yesterday showed a gradual weakening and lack of strength. Long positions continued to be cut, rumors about the Tianjin Incident were rampant, and the prospect of reaching the three-yuan line was considered. The interbank lending rate rose to two jiao, and the overdraft interest rate was as high as 1.23%. Financial institutions were mostly unwilling to accept public bonds as collateral. Small money shops were selling spot goods in large quantities, mostly hedging in foreign exchange, which was more profitable. Large investors were buying on small dips, creating a situation that was difficult to reverse. Future fluctuations were numerous. Yesterday's situation: opening prices were relatively flat, but after Lianhe Runli sold a large quantity, and Yuji Shunheng of No. 7 also sold, prices could not be sustained, falling by three or four jiao. On the buying side, Qiafeng Tongsheng bought the most, and Xieda and Tongkang of No. 13 slightly purchased. In the afternoon, investor confidence was damaged by rumors, and the market continued to weaken. Type C bonds broke the four-yuan barrier. Initially, it was very unsustainable, but large investors pulled up the market slightly. Like Lianhe, Shunxiang, Runli, and Songmao, there were continued sales, and market sentiment weakened. Finally, Tongsheng, Qiafeng, and Tiansheng bought, and Yuanhongda also still had an appetite, and prices rose slightly, but market sentiment was ultimately strained. After the close, market sentiment remained weak. As a result, prices continued to fall by a small four and a half jiao to six jiao. The total turnover was approximately one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock</p>
<p>Stock market securities exchange stocks: 100 shares were traded at a price of 19 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Shanghai Public Utilities Company reported that the stock market, in view of the uncertainty in Tianjin and Gulangyu, experienced a sell-off of long positions, so industrial stocks were hit and prices fell sharply. The worst-hit stocks are listed below.</p>
<p>At the closing, there seemed to be some absorption, but if the situation remains so tense, buyers in the market will want to stand aside and observe. The rubber stock market was not greatly affected, but trading was thin, buying prices fell, and sellers did not sell at these prices, so most stocks had a large difference between buying and selling prices, making it difficult to see any transactions. It seems believed that the events occurring in China should not permanently affect the value of the rubber industries in Java and Malaya.</p>
<p>The London British Far East Companies' stock prices on the 14th of this month (Wednesday) were generally flat. Only the Kailan Mining Administration's bearer shares fell by six pence, with a price of twenty shillings.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>London China Foreign Debt market prices on the 14th of this month were hovering, generally stable. Vickers Aircraft Loan bonds fell by one pound, with a price of fifteen pounds. Daokou-Qinghua Railway bonds rose by half a pound, with a price of eighteen and a half pounds. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>Shanghai Recovery Public Bond Lottery</p>
<p>The thirteenth lottery for the Shanghai Disaster Area Recovery Public Bond of 1932 (民國二十一年) was held at the Shanghai HSBC Bank at 4:00 PM on the 14th of this month. One winning ticket, number 33, was drawn, with a principal amount of 60,000 yuan in national currency, which, together with the thirteenth-period interest coupon, will be paid by the bank from the 15th of this month, limited to six years. After the expiration date, the bond will be invalid.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Food: Tianjin Concessions Blockaded; Flour Sales to the North Stalled; Rising Winds Also Hit <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market's rising winds suddenly stopped. Due to the blockade of the Tianjin concessions and the interruption of waterways, the saying that foreign ships were returning goods caused a great blow to the sales of Northern flour merchants. Customers stopped placing orders, and actual sales gradually weakened due to the prices being too high. The turnover decreased sharply. There were about 10,000 bags added by Southern flour merchants and about 10,000 bags sold in small batches in the local streets. Number 2 flour remained at four yuan and eight jiao, with no temporary changes. Foreign flour prices also leveled off. It was heard that several thousand bags of Lantern Brand were purchased by Northern merchants at a price of four yuan, seven jiao, and three fen. In the local streets, 2,000 to 3,000 bags of Bat Brand and other flours were sold at a price of four yuan, eight jiao, and four fen. The market environment was not as sharp as the previous two days.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of new wheat in the market continued to be small batches arriving at the port. The total amount of wheat arriving by train and boat was less than 1,000 bags. Currently, prices in various producing areas are expensive, making it difficult to match them with selling prices in the Shanghai market. In addition, neither Chinese factories nor Japanese merchants had a formal appetite for buying. Therefore, suppliers planned to store the wheat in warehouses to wait for a good price. As a result, the market was quiet in terms of both supply and demand. It was heard that over 200 bags of new Nanjing wheat were traded in the evening market at a price of six yuan and four jiao. The market was quite good, and it was also bought by local hoarding merchants.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>There are 8,857.5 tons, some of which have already been bagged, loaded on the (Riley) managed by Jardine Matheson, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 14th, but failed to arrive that day. Yesterday, the company said that the ship had sent a telegram stating that it should arrive tomorrow (the 17th). However, there is no space in the wharves and pontoons along the Huangpu River, so it will have to wait outside the Wusongkou. It is expected to be imported and unloaded around Tuesday of next week (the 20th).</p>
<p>Sources Increase Gradually; Rice Prices Rebound Greatly in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of Du Japonica rice from various merchant groups along the river had not yet arrived. The remaining momentum from the opening of the carload-packaged rice from the Suzhou-Tong merchant groups (包子蘇同帮) was still strong, and the situation continued to be tight. Later, the local streets and hoarding merchants' appetite turned weak, and the market color turned soft, so the market was stabilized. If it is always high, the price is still 19 yuan and 4 jiao. The other Japonica rice and thin rice were all around the original price. In short, this kind of market rose too quickly, which made people suspicious and hoped for a stabilized trend.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for passenger indica rice temporarily stabilized. During the morning opening, due to the rising trend of the past few days, suppliers continued to raise prices, and shops, hoarders, and factories continued to inquire, so prices rose by another one or two jiao. However, as sources gradually increased and goods on the way were also being rushed to Shanghai, profit-taking hoarders sought to sell early, and shop hoarders' appetite suddenly became dull. Later, the market fell by a small two jiao, and the medium-grade and old heated rice were cut by nearly one jiao. The northern pointed rice and port pointed rice were also similar.</p>
<p>The stock of foreign rice is all in the hands of merchants and hoarders, and the floating stock in the market is exhausted, so the market is gradually becoming chaotic. When various kinds of rice continued to rise in the morning market, Saigon rice once opened at 21 yuan, one or two jiao, and then opened at 21 yuan, slightly lower at 20 yuan, 8 jiao, and 20 yuan, 6 jiao and a half, bought by shops and consumers. Later, as passenger indica rice rebounded slightly, foreign rice also turned stable.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Miscellaneous Grains: Broad Beans Become Scarce and Expensive, Soybeans Sluggish and Declining <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Since new broad beans entered the market, prices have been quiet and gradually declining due to abundant supply. However, in the past two days, the supply has become scarce, leading to a slight increase in the market. Yesterday, the Swatow guild continued to handle 150 packages of Maojia City Beigang green broad beans at a price of $6.90, which is about 10 cents higher than the previous day. Our company purchased 50 packages of large white-skinned Chongming broad beans for $6.40, and over 500 packages of Jiading white-skinned broad beans for $6.15. It is said that these beans were brought back by the Weihai guild, so the selling price is 5 cents lower.</p>
<p>Since being affected by direct and indirect shocks, soybean prices had risen for a week. Yesterday, various speculative and hoarding activities showed signs of decline, and sentiment also declined with the environment. The entire market only inquired about three carts of Dalian Siping Street beans from our company. Trading opened with three price increases, at $9.35, $9.28, and $9.23, the lowest price of the day, which is $0.17 lower than the highest price of the previous day.</p>
<p>Fifty packages of soybeans were exported to Swatow today, and another 480 packages were exported to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Yarn and Cotton: Transactions Involving Speculation, Yarn Market Turbulent and Unstable, Tianjin Concession Issue Ultimately Leads to a Further Drop of $6 for "Double Globe" Yarn <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Following the previous day's false boom, buyers were scarce, and asking prices suddenly dropped by $5. 20-count "Double Horse" foreign yarn opened at $485, a significant drop of $7. The highest price for "Double Horse" yarn was $475, with only 10 bales traded. 20-count "Shepherd" yarn fell below the $400 mark, reaching $395. Unexpectedly, the decline was so severe that a major yarn merchant, Mou Ji, had to intervene. Mou Feng Yarn Store, typically busy with daily transactions, can be considered a mainstay of the current yarn market. Yesterday, influenced by the environment, their arrival was late, and they observed without acting, which significantly reduced market activity. Towards the close of trading, multiple parties came to support the market. Mou Chang of the exchange and Mou Company purchased and added to their positions, buying as many as 400-500 bales of 20-count "Double Globe" yarn. This temporarily halted the false boom, and many followed suit. 20-count "Double Horse" foreign yarn was pulled up again to $484 at closing, but only 10 bales were traded, with warehouse receipts still priced at $477.5. In the afternoon, the bullish sentiment revived due to the higher closing price in the morning. Trading opened with price increases. 20-count "Double Horse" warehouse receipts reached $481, and spot goods reached $487. Soon after, short positions in money exchanges sold off, and news of the tense situation in the Tianjin concession spread, causing a sudden drop. However, inter-dealer trading was prevalent, with highly speculative transactions. Given the volume of these transactions, future changes remain volatile. The closing price for 20-count "Double Horse" foreign yarn was $482, and the warehouse receipt price was $476. Statistics show that various guilds purchased a total of 3,100 bales throughout the day, while inter-dealer trading amounted to 2,425 bales. Prices for 20-count "Double Horse" and "Double Globe" yarn fell by $6 each. "Shepherd" yarn and coarse yarn remained unchanged. Shenxin Factory offered 800 bales of 10-count red "Double Horse" yarn at $390 (all marked), for delivery from July to September. Yesterday, 300 bales of cotton yarn arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin. Today, 260 bales were exported to Niutou and 315 bales were exported to Hong Kong. The purchase volume of each guild is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Sales of Japanese yarn are limited. 20-count "Yueqin" yarn opened at $400 in the morning, rose to $402 in the afternoon, but weakened again at closing.</p>

<p>Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market was calm in the morning. Later, due to encouraging reports from overseas cotton markets and severe domestic spot shortages, sales of cloth improved daily, and prices were also very high. Recent weather reports from various cotton-growing regions are concerned about excessive rainfall and active pests. According to various predictions, this year's new cotton crop will be reduced to around 11 million bales, leading to an optimistic outlook for New York cotton prices. Discussions on cotton industry relief funds will resume tomorrow. It is reported that the government has agreed to allocate $22.5 million, but the remaining $11.3 million will be discussed in detail. Yesterday, New York rose 7-8 points, while Indian cotton remained unchanged and Egyptian cotton rose 2-3 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was quieter yesterday, mainly due to the decline in yarn prices. However, interest among traders was strong, and if there were any outlets, but due to high asking prices from all sides, the transaction volume was not large, totaling about 1,200 bales.</p>
<p>Japanese-owned Yu Feng Factory is expanding significantly and aggressively purchasing American cotton, acquiring 1,100 bales of packed American cotton (each bale weighing 500 pounds) at a high price of $101.50. This Hua cotton is bright and clean, suitable for blending with Indian cotton for spinning, which increases both efficiency and production. As a result, the price is high. Other traders' Indian cotton business, which had seen large volumes for days, has now slowed down slightly. Regarding cotton from Northern Jiangsu, 204 bales of Xia Sha cotton have arrived. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's market showed a loose exterior but a tight interior. After several days of rapid price increases, hoarders were reluctant to sell, and floating inventory was being released slightly. Additionally, due to the blockade of the Tianjin concession, Northern sales were stalled, and the resumption of direct shipping to Ningbo would take time. Therefore, although there was demand, buyers were hesitant to act. Wenzhou merchants, lacking ships for days, have purchased some cheap white goods and are taking a wait-and-see approach, resulting in lower transaction volume. However, interest in colored serge, broadcloth, straight tribute silk, and flannel remains strong, with over 100 additional cases purchased. Merchants from Guangdong and Shantou also purchased nearly 100 cases of the aforementioned autumn goods. Demand for colored serge remains strong, with factories unable to meet orders. Merchants from Mazhang purchased over 100 cases of goods produced by Daxin and other factories. Over 1,000 bolts of colored cloth were purchased by merchants from Taizhou and Xinghua in Northern Jiangsu. Postal parcels to Yunnan province, including piece goods and miscellaneous items for Jianshui, Mengzi, and Shiping, have been approved and will resume on the 16th, with 3,000 packages to be sent. Our company sold 150 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse serge, and fine serge. Hoarders purchased 100 bales of Yihua 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, fine cloth and fine serge declined in price due to the serious situation in Tianjin, which stalled Northern sales. Tianjin merchants continued to sell off their goods, leading to a significant price drop. The lowest price for the leading fine cloth in the morning was $14.25, but prices recovered later. At closing, the current month's leading price was $14.45, and prices for higher-end fine cloth have gradually leveled off. However, the price difference for next month's goods is significant, with the leading fine cloth still requiring $14.65. Actual sales in our company were slow, with only 600-700 pieces traded throughout the day.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 16th, 15 bolts were exported to Hong Kong and 140 bolts were exported to Shantou.</p>

<p>Little Cassimere, originally called (Shark skili) … silk, its face selling price is higher than all the top-tier white … broadcloth, white straight tribute silk. It is truly too extravagant, so market sales cannot be popularized. Previously, the American-made double-width Little Cassimere sample pieces sold for $42.50 per yard, discounted to $17. The larger sample pieces, with a firmer single-width body, cost $12.50 per yard. It is mostly worn by people in dance halls, who do not find it expensive.</p>

<p>Overseas silk markets are volatile, with minimal price fluctuations. The market situation yesterday seemed to be in a wait-and-see mode. In the local silk market, white factories saw no transactions at $2150 for 78% grade, an increase of $10. However, since the issue of fresh cocoons arriving in Shanghai has not yet been resolved, most manufacturers are generally unwilling to dump their goods. Yesterday, British and French traders made 40 bales, and Indian traders made 30 bales. The market situation was unremarkable.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Green Tea Steps Up, Transactions Brisk <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign firms' green tea, especially the top grade, continued to rise by $5 to $10. "Tong Zhen" and "Zhen Mei" grades all rose steadily. Throughout the day, Baochang, Yongxing, Tongfu, Jinlong, Doudell, and other firms traded over 600 boxes of these grades. The top grade even reached $285 to $290, "Tong Zhen" from $215 to $220, and "Zhen Mei" from $670 to over $110. The market was very firm. However, Mao tea from Ningwen and other areas is still difficult to sell well.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were no changes in Hong Kong and Holland prices, but London prices rose slightly. August futures were at 6 shillings 9.5 pence, and December futures were at 6 shillings 15.25 pence, both up by a fraction of a penny. March futures for next year remained at 6 shillings. The local trade association's prices were flat. Spot No. 24 grain, both warehouse and foreign warehouse goods, were priced at the original levels. Customs warehouse was at $20.50 for 500 bags, and road goods were at $25.20 for 200 bags. Taikoo "Che Bai B" wheat (small nine) was at $28.85 for 200 bags, "CW" mark was at $28.60, and "CX" mark was at $28.30 (both small two). Lower grades saw no changes. Domestically produced "You Mian Chi" firms were interested in purchasing, but because the goods arriving were scarce and Dutch red prices were high, they were unwilling to sell much. The future is expected to be tight. Only 90 bags of ordinary "Mian Chi" were offered at $16. "Ti Qing" is also expected to remain tight, with second-grade "Qing" offered at $10.50 for 70 bags, due to their soft texture and faded color. There were continuous offers of "Diao Qing," still at $14.40. Regarding sugar arriving in Shanghai, there were 777 bags from Beihai, 117 bags from Hong Kong, and 654 bags from Shantou.</p>

<p>The arrival of "Xiang Chun Ya" (Chinese toon sprouts) is excessive, and fatigue is increasing. The highest price for the top grade was $80, but it has gradually fallen and is now only selling for $20, only one-quarter of the initial price. It can be said to be extremely cheap. Ordinary grade is at $12, and there is little hope of a rebound in the short term.</p>

<p>Dutch "Sheng Fen" was previously being dumped, but due to limited arrivals, it is almost in short supply. Recently, although the exchange rate has declined, prompting purchases from various guilds, market prices are high. Currently, "Ren Qiang" brand is being sold at $21.20, "Fei Qilin" at $20, "San X" and "KG" brands are both at $15.50, "Qing Shuang T" at $18.80, "Shuang T" at $17.80, and "Jia He" at $16.80, all up by $1-2 compared to the previous market.

<p>Yantai Longxu Island shrimp tails have become scarce and demand remains strong, so the market is firm. Another batch was sold yesterday at $112, $5 higher than the previous market price.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Metals: Angle Iron Sales Brisk <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Angle iron prices had previously fallen by $0.40-0.50 due to sluggish sales. Yesterday, due to activity from the Qingdao and Yantai guilds, as well as local businesses, the market felt more active. However, because the Japanese recently blockaded the Tianjin concession, the Tianjin market was chaotic, and buyers were not interested in purchasing, resulting in little activity. Other guilds were doing well. Five to six hundred dan were offered throughout the city yesterday, and sales were relatively brisk, with prices increasing by $0.60-0.70. For example, one-inch was selling for $15.50, two-inch for $15.25, two-and-a-half-inch for $15.00, and three-inch for $15.00 (unit: per city dan).</p>

<p>Camphor Recovers After Falling: Camphor is effective in killing insects and preventing epidemics. Domestic products are mostly from Jinhua and Lanxi, but there are also many imports from Hong Kong. The highest price previously was $420 per dan. Recently, sales have slowed down due to the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival, and some smaller businesses are eager to sell, with lower-grade goods selling for only $300. However, firms with higher-grade goods are unwilling to sell cheaply due to frequent declines in the Hong Kong exchange rate. The asking price is now $370-380, and the market has recovered.</p>
<p>Alisma Market Mediocre: Due to scarce supply, the highest price for Double Flower Alisma previously exceeded $60. Later, continuous shipments from Chaoshan and other places led to a price decline, falling to $52. Currently, purchases from various guilds are quiet, and the market remains mediocre. However, due to the tense situation in the Lake Shantou region, there is a risk of supply disruption, so the outlook is positive.</p>
<p>New Honeysuckle About to Arrive: Honeysuckle is currently in high demand, and there is also a transition between old and new crops. Numbered firms are eager to sell off their old stocks, but distributors are not interested. Yesterday's offering was only $40, down by over $10 from the previous price. New goods have already been shipped and are on the way.</p>
<p>Black and White Pepper Have Tightened: The pepper market has been consistently bullish recently due to the exchange rate situation. Currently, No. 1 pepper is offered at $55 in banknotes. White pepper, which had previously fallen to $84, is now being offered at $90, and the trend is firm.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Four-Character Maxims <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Peini</p>
<p>Ancient sages had many proverbs about clothing, food, housing, and transportation that could be used as mottos. Contemporary celebrities also have many four-character maxims about clothing, food, housing, and transportation that are worth considering. Here are a few examples for readers. Dr. Jiang Kanghu, who has lectured in the Americas for many years, is very healthy and has never been ill. He has a four-character maxim: "Cloth, Vegetarian, Exposure, Walk." Choose simple cloth, easy to wash. Eat mostly vegetarian food, avoid meat. Live in exposure, not closed in. Walk often to exercise muscles and bones. The famous calligrapher Ma Gongping works hard but takes good care of his health. He is old but energetic and good at breathing. He has a four-character maxim: "Light, Calm, Breath, Yield." Wear light clothing. Be calm in all things. Breathe deeply. Walk with a gentle pace, not hurried. Minister of Justice Long Wenqian is very energetic, works quickly, and values health. He has a four-character maxim: "Appropriate, Hot, Clean, Straight." Wear clothes that fit, not formal. Eat cooked food, avoid raw or cold. Live in a clean place, not necessarily beautiful. Walk straight, do not hunch over. (Thank you for your response.)</p>

<p>— Wang Baiqian</p>
<p>Leather shoes are the most popular and common type of footwear. Not only do people in the upper classes wear them, but even middle-class people and laborers want to buy them. At the very least, they will buy a cheap pair from a used goods stall by the roadside. As a result, the leather shoe industry has developed immensely.</p>
<p>With the times, leather shoes have evolved from flat heels to high heels, from round toes to pointed toes. Recently, a new type of cream-colored leather sole has been introduced… with many different styles to meet the needs of the public. However, cream-colored soles… are the footwear of wealthy young masters and ladies, who are meticulous in every aspect. As a result of this meticulous pursuit, they came up with the idea of having women shine their shoes, so that their leather shoes are always kept shiny. This is certainly the happiness of wealthy young masters and ladies.</p>
<p>Women's shoe shining companies are usually located near dance halls. For example, the "Elegant Foot Women's Shoe Shining Company" near a dance hall has a very simple interior. Besides five or six women,</p>
<p>Due to the need for refinement, the styles of leather shoes change with the times, but there is nothing else of note. Their attire is strange, resembling a half-female student and half-factory worker. When a customer arrives, they are greeted warmly and seated. The women then begin to work—shining shoes. They are indeed experienced shoe shiners. The price is $0.14 for patent leather, $0.17 for champagne leather, $0.07 for ordinary leather, and $0.04 for white powder polish. The busiest time of day is when the lights are turned on, as many men and women are eager to show off and flock to the place. The business is exceptionally good and closes around 11:00 p.m., catering to the tastes of partygoers.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Utilization of Broad Beans <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Broad beans contain more protein than rice by a factor of four, and more than barley by a factor of more than one. The amount of starch they contain is equal to that of rice and barley. The amount of starch they contain is less than that of rice and barley by a factor of one-third. Therefore, they can stave off hunger without producing phlegm. If sprouted, ground with water to form a paste, dried in the sun on bricks, roasted until fragrant, and then ground into powder, mixed with refined flour or sugar, and pressed into square cakes, they can be used as snacks. If used for military purposes, they can relieve hunger and quench thirst, but they must be chewed thoroughly to produce saliva and then swallowed in small portions. One square inch can be equivalent to one he of rice, capable of sustaining hunger for four hours (the same is true for iron beans). To stop children from crying from hunger during times of hardship, adults should chew them into a paste and feed them a fingertip's worth. Because they contain saliva, they are easily digested, will not cause bloating, and can sustain hunger for twice as long as wheat flour. Some say that broad beans cause bloating, but this refers to those who eat too much when boiled. Once roasted, they can relieve bloating, but should not be eaten in excess. They should only be eaten when hungry and stopped before feeling full. This applies to all things.</p>
<p>The entire broad bean shell, stem, and leaves contain a large amount of fixed nitrogen and can be soaked to make fertilizer. They are extremely easy to grow and contain nitrogenous fertilizer. Dried and burned, they can repel mosquitoes and flies. The ash can be placed in a bamboo basket with springs, covered with a jar, with a hole drilled in the side of the jar. Arrange four jars in a row, and connect a bucket underneath. Pour boiling water into the first bucket, which will then leak down through the second, third, and fourth buckets. The liquid can be scooped up, dried, and made into blocks. The black blocks can then be mixed with wood ash and placed in the stove, causing it to turn gray-white. When redissolved in water, the organic matter is converted to charcoal, which can be precipitated and filtered. The filtered liquid is boiled with alkali, which is sold as gelatin and has a wide range of uses. It can be used to wash oily clothes.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Review of Gujiazhai Park <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuodai</p>
<p>To discuss Gujiazhai Park, one must first understand the history of French gardens. The early French garden was created by a Frenchman named Nordel, who learned from the Italians. Italian gardens were built on sloping hillsides, so terraces and levels were the main elements. The French landscape is different, consisting mostly of plains. Nordel adapted the Italian hillside garden design to a flat style, and this is the French style. The famous gardens of Versailles are representative examples created by Nordel.</p>
<p>Italian gardens are on hillsides, so the focus is on overlooking the landscape. The French style transforms the Italian style into a flat landscape, so the focus is also on overlooking the landscape, utilizing the boundless scenery of the plains to create a grand and magnificent feeling. But this French style is best suited for large areas. Small-scale gardens may seem too simple. This led to the emergence of a new French garden.</p>
<p>The Italian style and the French style are both formal styles. The new French style incorporates some natural elements. As a result, the French garden becomes a hybrid, with Nordel's elegant and gorgeous designs as the foreground and natural landscapes as the background. What is now known as the French style is the latter.</p>
<p>Gujiazhai Park clearly belongs to the latter. There are many flat, open areas for viewing, such as flower beds, lawns, and ponds. In addition, the towering trees lining the paths and the forested area along the western side are all naturalistic backgrounds. In these respects, it is a pure new French style.</p>
<p>However, some parts still have an Eastern flavor, which is probably due to environmental factors. Building artificial mountains is a Chinese specialty, but they have little value in terms of garden art. From an enjoyment perspective, they do not create a sense of exploration for visitors. Gujia Mao Park also has these features, which are obviously adapted to the environment. The stones are well-chosen (because they do not use Taihu stones), but the arrangement is not very clever.</p>
<p>In the center of the pond, there is a fountain. Below the fountain is a glass umbrella with lighting. When the lights are turned on at night, one realizes that the glass is multicolored, red and green, which is very eye-catching. This aspect may also be catering to the Chinese, but it is too vulgar.</p>
<p>The surface of the pond is covered with a lot of man-made trash, which is the result of some uncultured visitors.</p>
<p>This type of garden is best enjoyed on fine days in the spring and autumn. In the summer, it is best to visit early in the morning or in the evening, as it cannot be enjoyed under the scorching sun. In the winter, it can only be visited on warm and sunny days. Considering the size and population of the French Concession, Gujiazhai Park is actually not enough. However, looking at it another way, not everyone who visits has the purpose of resting, entertaining, or appreciating the scenery. There are also many men and women with other intentions.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The weather is getting hotter every day. Summer has truly arrived. Even if fatty fish, meat, and richly flavored dishes are spread all over the table, they may make people feel slightly apprehensive. Therefore, every meal must include something refreshing. Speaking of refreshing dishes, one must abandon stir-frying and focus on dishes that are tossed. For example, chicken shreds tossed with lettuce. Readers may be startled by the word "chicken," thinking that chicken prices are so high that it could not be in an economic menu. In fact, there is no need to be alarmed. You can go to a larger local market and buy a chicken leg for two jiao and some lettuce for one jiao. When you get home, cut them into shreds, blanch the chicken, soak the lettuce, and then mix with soy sauce and sesame oil. The taste is very good. Another example is mixing shredded egg skin, shredded pork, and bean sprouts. Those who like sour flavors can add some Zhenjiang vinegar. This is commonly known as "tossed with vinegar" and is also very palatable. As for vegetarian dishes, there is cucumber slices tossed with sweet and sour sauce, cucumber shreds, mung bean noodles, and sesame paste, as well as tofu tossed with Chinese toon and sesame oil. These are all very refreshing and can be eaten with rice or porridge.</p>

<p>— Xi</p>
<p>Later, after research by Baron Karl Drais von Sauerbronn of Germany, a single-track vehicle was created and first appeared in Mannheim, Germany, in 1817. The following year, he brought this vehicle to London, where the public was impressed by his ingenuity and gave it many names, the most common being Dandyhorse. A major difference between this vehicle and those made previously was that it had a front wheel mounted on a steering axis, allowing it to be freely controlled. The Baron had hoped to make a big splash in London, but he was soon ridiculed and satirized by many cartoonists and writers, so the Dandyhorse had to beat a retreat, bidding farewell to London forever. However, it did at least inspire one gentleman, Kirkpatrick Macmillan, who lived in Scotland. He attached a crank to the Dandyhorse, and by using long rods, tirelessly strived to achieve movement, resulting in the birth of the pedal bicycle.</p>
<p>Macmillan's vehicle, created in 1839, greatly amazed the local people. Macmillan often invited many guests to personally demonstrate the vehicle in a field, but the world remained indifferent. It was not until fifty years later that Dalzell of Lanark Outer Borough created the first truly functional pedal bicycle, which appeared on the market, and this transforming vehicle, "BICYCLE," gradually attracted the world's attention, bringing him great fame. Lanark's new vehicle was based on Macmillan's 1846 model. In 1889, Macmillan's vehicle was still displayed at the London Vehicle Exhibition, labeled as the original old-style bicycle. Over the decades, Macmillan's vehicle underwent several significant changes. In 1868, someone attached pedals to the front wheel to replace Macmillan's lever pedals. In 1879, someone placed the two wheels side by side, with the rider sitting in the middle. In 1878, lever pedals and a rear wheel were restored, but the rear wheel was twice the size of the front wheel. Later, Lawson's safety bicycle appeared, truly innovating, but the handlebars were placed too high, causing inconvenience for the rider. It was not until Lawson's successor moved the seat above the front wheel, with the front wheel's diameter being four feet six inches, that the rider could suddenly and freely move up and down and advance in any direction.</p>
<p>In 1888, Dunlop invented the rubber tire, earning him fame and fortune. Previously, bicycles were only used for occasional amusement, but their numbers gradually increased. Then, the hard rubber on the wheels was replaced with pneumatic tires, and bicycles became popular worldwide. Since then, the main principles of the bicycle have remained largely unchanged. Wire wheels were first used in 1870, and ball bearings were first used in 1877. As for the small mechanical components on the bicycle, they also required much thought and underwent several improvements to achieve today's lightness and agility.

<h3 id="e71">An Opinion from a Translator <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>Casually browsing the catalogs of recently published books, I cannot help but notice a noteworthy phenomenon in the publishing industry: translated works tend to surpass original works in general. In terms of quantity, original works undoubtedly still dominate, but in terms of quality and appeal to readers, translated works certainly hold a proportionally overwhelming advantage.</p>
<p>Taking Shanghai as an example, one of the greatest achievements in publishing recently has been the publication of "The Complete Works of Lu Xun." At the same time, there has also been the appearance of "The Complete Works of Lenin" and the fully translated "Das Kapital." However, in terms of new original works, we have not yet seen a truly powerful work (regardless of its nature). But in terms of translated works, there have appeared a considerable number of works sufficient to attract a large segment of readers. In addition to the aforementioned "Complete Works of Lenin" and "Das Kapital," the more famous translated works published in the past year include "Red Star Over China," "Continued Red Star Over China," "Japan Challenges the World," "Japan's Gamble in China," "The New Chinese," "Japanese Spies," "Record of Japanese Army Atrocities in China," "Red Front," "The New Soviet Constitution," "China Fights for Freedom," "Impressions of New China," as well as Pearl Buck's recently published "The Patriot," and "Inside Asia," which is currently being rushed into translation following "Inside Europe," etc. Moreover, there are as many as one hundred seventy-eight more works either announced or that I personally know are being translated.</p>
<p>This "prosperous" phenomenon in the translation field, on the bright side, introducing foreign viewpoints and ideas as a reference for our own country's cultural work is originally a very gratifying phenomenon. We certainly cannot complain that there are too many translated works. In fact, compared to Japan, our introductory work is still far behind, although the quality of introductory work in Japan at present is far inferior to ours.</p>
<p>But here, we should reflect: Why do foreign authors specifically write so many works about recent Chinese issues (or Sino-Japanese issues and Far Eastern issues), while our own country's authors do not have such achievements to show? A foreign journalist comes to China, observes for a year or two, and then publishes a book about Chinese issues upon returning home. Logically, Chinese journalists, who have more access than foreign journalists, should have even better achievements, but in reality, while it cannot be said that there are absolutely none, the works of value that are published are a minority within a minority.</p>
<p>For example, in a novel like "The Patriot," there is no reason why a Chinese literary author could not write it. I personally even deeply believe that if a Chinese writer with existing literary cultivation and skills were to handle the same subject matter, they would definitely write something even better than Pearl Buck.</p>
<p>However, up to now, we have not discovered powerful new original works. I personally am someone engaged in translation work. My raising the above question is certainly not intended to blame the dereliction of duty of creative writers. Because I know that the current environment has all sorts of difficulties. But I cannot help but admit the pain that I often feel in my heart. Every time I resolve to begin translating a good book about Chinese events, I cannot help but have such a feeling in my heart: Why are these good materials and good subjects not handled and organized by our own writers, but instead, we wait for others to write them before translating them back? Clearly, it is our own thing, but we have to use someone else's name. This phenomenon is too heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Translation work has its own independent meaning, but a translator with national consciousness does not hope to specialize in translating things that could have been written by his own country's authors; his main responsibility does not lie here. But those currently engaged in translation work, because the objective situation is like this, have no choice but to temporarily set aside the responsibility of introducing Western culture and return the Chinese problem materials collected by foreign authors back to their original owners.</p>
<p>My view may be too shallow and narrow, but it comes from the most sincere and purest motives.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Reading the Ji Rang Ji Collection <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>Because I wanted to study the life of Tang Shunzhi, a Ming Dynasty scholar who resisted pirates, I made a special effort to carefully read the Tang Jingchuan Ji collection. Jingchuan highly praised Shao Yong's Yi Chuan Ji Rang Ji collection, which aroused my interest in reading the Ji Rang Ji collection.</p>
<p>The Hanfenlou Secret Collection edition of the Yi Chuan Ji Rang Ji, has a total of four volumes, printed very meticulously, and the paper is especially clean and delightful. The books of this kind in the school library are probably borrowed by me, a person who is out of touch with the times, to occasionally read, except for feeding bookworms.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, Shao Yong's poems are too didactic and mostly rational. Some places are simply no different from gathas and dogmas. Although there is a poetic flavor, it is not as strong as the philosophical meaning. It can be said to be a completely philosophical poetry collection.</p>
<p>Speaking of philosophy, let Mr. Ma Yifu and others preach in the Fuxing Academy. I can only extract a few words from the Ji Rang Ji to admonish myself.</p>
<p>Adornment Poem</p>
<p>Adornment at the time is called skillful, the accomplishment seems like a real home. Must beware of cold eyes entering to observe, ashamed puppets have no curtains to cover.</p>
<p>Clay and Wood Puppet</p>
<p>Clay and wood puppets, be careful not to laugh at each other! When the sky is about to rain heavily, you can only condole each other.</p>
<p>There are too many puppets without curtains to cover them at present. "Called skillful" and "seem like a real home," are they ultimately "skillful" and "real home"? It is just "allegedly" and "resemble" (as if something important is happening).</p>
<p>As for the clay and wood puppets, they seem to be laughing triumphantly for a while, but when a heavy rain falls, they can only "condole each other."</p>
<p>There is a Big Fish in the East Sea</p>
<p>There is a big fish in the East Sea, nets cannot approach, if it loses water, ants can trap it.</p>
<p>What this big fish refers to, I think discerning people will know at a glance. It seems that no nets can approach it at present, but when its power is exhausted, it will immediately become a "crucian carp in a dry rut," and its death is approaching.</p>
<p>Also, Kangjie said in the "Luxury Poem": "Extravagance cannot be extreme, luxury cannot be endless; extreme leads to disaster, endless leads to misfortune." It seems that we Chinese people, who are still prone to extravagant habits today, should take this as a warning.</p>
<p>In his "Up and Down Poem," he says: "...Observe things with your own heart, what thing can be one? Observe the heart with things, what heart is not equal?" I think it is the same as the saying that "idealists say that the mind dominates matter, and materialists say that matter dominates the mind." I wonder if someone will laugh at me for being far-fetched?</p>
<p>He extremely opposes bookworms, which shows that he is not advocating reading books to death. There is a poem called "Exposing Books" as proof.</p>
<p>Insects harm books less, people harm books more. Insects are removed by exposure, what should be done with people?</p>
<p>His views on poetry are as follows:</p>
<p>Why is it called poetry? Poetry is expressing one's ambition. Once words are used to form chapters, the matters in the heart are then stated. Not only refine the words, but also refine the meaning. Refining the words yields strange sentences, refining the meaning yields marrow.</p>
<p>——On Poetry Poem</p>
<p>The Ji Rang Ji has four volumes and twenty chapters, and there is too much to talk about. What I have quoted is only a few dozen words above. It is truly the so-called "Let it be three thousand weak waters, I only take a scoop to drink."</p>

<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>There are many beggars by the roadside, filthy, disabled, and the stench is overwhelming. The two Pengs were frightened when they saw them, because they had seen many of these ailments in their hometown. The larger ones were like leprosy, but in Hunan, it was limited to beggars sitting in "paralyzed sedan chairs." I couldn't help but say again in a pedantic way:</p>
<p>"Speaking of history again, leprosy is also a national essence. I once saw a medical newspaper saying that Confucius' disciple Bo Niu died of 'leprosy.' This so-called 'leprosy' is leprosy. If even Bo Niu, with his good morals, got leprosy, wouldn't the bad ones have to open a skylight?"</p>
<p>People in Guangdong see many lepers, but they hate talking about it. It is a very terrible thing, but in Hunan, it is limited to beggars sitting in "paralyzed sedan chairs," which is a bit strange. Could it be that people in Hunan are all scoundrels?</p>
<p>A few more miles up, the mountain road became steeper. There were still some people in relatively good condition, who looked like refugee farmers, guarding a small triangular thatched shed in a place with shade and spring water, as if the whole family lived inside. They used "begging books" to ask people in long robes to write a few words, begging for small donations of ten or twenty copper coins. According to passers-by, some of them, after collecting these donations, bought one or two piglets, and together they lived and ate in the thatched shed. When the meat embryos grew up, they rushed to Nanyue City, where they could become small stall owner.</p>
<p>Among the dwarf trees on the mountainside, some small monks were picking something. Judging from the bamboo shoot husks left by the roadside, they were looking for a large number of small bamboo shoots, preparing to transport them back to the temple, grind them into powder with iron mortars, and make vegetarian cakes for the long-term vegetarian diet. There were also some local merchants picking medicinal herbs, sweating and working silently among the mountain rocks. They obtained large quantities of raw land, honeysuckle, angelica and other more valuable medicinal herbs, seemingly enduring any hardship. However, the quality of Nanyue's medicine is very poor; because the mountain land is barren and the climate is harsh, the properties of the medicine change when it grows. However, they use this to supply the market within a hundred or two hundred miles, which is more than enough.</p>
<p>These situations were roughly learned from a brief conversation with an old monk who was traveling along the same road.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>We looked at the map for a while and found a stone staircase. After a mile's distance, we came to a very secluded and elegant place – Banyun Temple. At the foot of the temple, clouds and smoke stretched like cotton, lightly covering the Yan family, green trees, rice fields, manure ponds, people and dogs below the mountain.</p>
<p>"This is a place worth lingering in," said Da Peng. "I have never believed in those traditional painters. Now I can prove from here that the matter of 'clouds stopping halfway up the mountain' is not false. It turns out that the foundation of traditional painters' art is also something that people should explore!"</p>
<p>The temple was very ancient. On the stone steps, moss and felt were as thick as wool. Trees that were more than three hundred years old, and the vines attached to them, had been growing for a century. Like dragons and snakes, they protruded into the semi-space. The houses, which had been repaired countless times, were plastered with some powder on the stone blocks. The abbot was jointly appointed by a monk and a Taoist priest; the monk was fat and the Taoist priest was thin, vividly showing the outer appearances of two types.</p>
<p>Their lives were business-like. When they saw passengers in sedan chairs, they had to bring out the begging books; but for pedestrians, a cup of tea and a meal had to be asked for. Their two main rooms were rented to the families of two military officers. One was the wife of a brigade commander, and the other was the wife of a regimental commander. They lived very simply, as if they hadn't even hired a maid.</p>
<p>Er Peng had a great power of observation; he lingered at the doorway for a while, and then came out and said to me and Da Peng:</p>
<p>"The regimental commander's wife is okay. That brigade commander's wife—ugh..."</p>
<p>"Maybe," Da Peng responded, "the monk just hinted something to me, maybe even the monk..." After a while, he took a drag of half a cigarette, and then said:</p>
<p>"Lao Li, you might as well use the realist approach to paint the modern materials covered by ancient civilization. I am willing to be a small critic, at least proving that there is not a single lie in your work."</p>
<p>They all laughed. The Taoist priest walked from afar, leading us to see a building twenty or thirty steps away—the China Travel Service.</p>
<p>From the Taoist priest's statement, we learned that this place was where Zhang Xueliang was "secretly released" in Nanyue some time ago. Now it is being prepared to be left for important people to live in. We saw some civil servants sitting and chatting at the door, and a wounded pilot, half of his head wrapped up, leaning on a walking stick.</p>
<p>The Taoist said, "Rest for a while, gentlemen! We are all family, all born in China, and follow Chinese teachings..."</p>
<p>A boy brought tea and placed it on the stone steps. Everyone yielded for a while. We began to converse for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e76">The Lonely Wave of the Hai River <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Hou</p>
<p>This is a letter written by Englishman A in Tianjin to Englishman B in Shanghai. B is a friend of mine, and with his permission, I am able to translate and publish a section of the letter concerning Tianjin. However, he is unwilling to reveal his real name, so they will only be referred to as A and B here.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the air is still relatively fresh, although we already feel suffocated; but in Tianjin, this ancient city, only the muddy waves of the Hai River can still surge freely. As a foreigner, it is not easy for me to obtain the usual preferential treatment that I receive in other parts of China here. Indeed, we also have our concession here, but the situation is ten times worse than in Shanghai. The concession, like the Hai River, is overflowing with muddy currents.</p>
<p>Arriving here is even worse than a prisoner arriving at the courtroom. The interrogation is extremely strict, and after seeing the "little devils," one must also see the "deities"—the so-called "little devils" and "deities" are popular slang in Tianjin, with "deities" referring to the Japanese, and the meaning of "little devils" being self-evident. In the first few days, it seemed that my movements were being monitored at all times. Later, I made a special trip to visit a Chinese friend I had met in Harbin, who has a not-so-unfamiliar name: "Tao Yanxin" (transliteration). He had once been detained by the young general Zhang Xueliang, but is now an educational administrator here. After not seeing each other for several years, this middle-aged politician has grown a Nazi-style mustache. I know that his past years have been spent on "good neighbor" work, and now he seems to be partially successful; however, his position is constantly shaking as if in a dream. In the north, the "little devils"—and I'm afraid it's not just in the north—must, on the one hand, endure the suspicion of the suspicious "deities," and on the other hand, consider the attention of the children growing up in this land.</p>
<p>The greatest danger for the Chinese in Tianjin is the issue of thought. "Thought criminals" are almost impossible to accommodate in prisons. Because the meaning of so-called thought criminals is extremely broad. There was a Chinese painter who was arrested by the police for drawing a plum blossom under a circle. According to the painter, the circle symbolizes the moon, and Chinese people generally draw plum blossoms together with the moon, but the Japanese said that the circle symbolizes the sun, and the plum blossom is the national flower designated by the Chiang Kai-shek government!</p>
<p>Here, the Japanese use the number of their compatriots arrested by Chinese people acting as police officers as the standard for promotion. Therefore, the police in Tianjin are only concerned with arresting people all day long. Often, when two police officers meet, they ask each other: "How much gold sand did you pan today?" "Gold sand" has become a euphemism for prisoners! However, the Tianjin police often become others' "gold sand" themselves when performing their duties at night!</p>
<p>There are many burning incidents here, and the places where fires break out are generally owned by a certain party. As for the cause of the fires, even those involved are tight-lipped!</p>
<p>The economic plunder here can be said to be meticulous. I have attached a "half-cent reserve coupon" (see the copper engraving), from which you can see their means of exploitation.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Impressions of "The Beginning of Man" <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"There is no such thing as a bad child!" After watching "The Beginning of Man," I remembered the words of Father Flanagan in "Boys Town." And the power of education, finally, even a stubborn, wild child like Michel Rougon can be reformed. "The Beginning of Man" is about a girls' reformatory outside Paris. This place also imprisons a group of young criminal girls. But the director, Émile, treats these girls like prisoners, and the tool of reform is "corporal punishment."</p>
<p>"There is no such thing as a bad child!"—This group of helpless girls were only sent to the reformatory for minor faults. In their pure souls, they equally adore the air of freedom, but under the wrong methods of reform, the inevitable result will be to provoke the opposite. Lanie sees Suzanne and Georges kissing, and uses this to blackmail Suzanne into stealing cigarettes and alcohol, causing a catastrophe. This is the inevitable cause and effect of the greater the pressure, the greater the resistance. There is an even more obvious example here: no matter how strict the discipline, as long as they have an opportunity, they will pick up bricks on the ground to destroy the rules of the reformatory. This made the newly appointed director Yvonne see clearly that "corporal punishment is not enough to tame their nature."</p>
<p>Let's look at the results under reasonable reform methods.</p>
<p>Yvonne releases this stubborn, wild Suzanne to go shopping in the city, giving her a happy afternoon. Director Émile naturally opposes this method, but Suzanne finally returns before nine o'clock.</p>
<p>"There is no such thing as a bad child!" We can now believe Flanagan's words.</p>
<p>At the same time, "The Beginning of Man," under the superb skill of director Herschel Daugherty, every scene and every play is handled very movingly.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the film, the camera moves from the vast sky to the narrow walls of the reformatory, and with Émile's violent cry of "Two, one, two," a group of girls are shown doing morning exercises under strict supervision. Suzanne is ordered to go to the city to shop. She walks out of the iron gate of the reformatory. She stands in the sunlight outside the door. She seems to feel that her own existence is a little hazy. When she lies on the grass, watching the flocks of birds in the sky, the movement of the majestic clouds, and the swaying of the wheat waves in the wind, this simple picture shows how those children crave the world of freedom.</p>
<p>Although the story later progresses to Suzanne and Georges' love, there is one scene that cannot be ignored: Lanie blackmails Suzanne into stealing alcohol and causing trouble, but when she learns that Suzanne has been approved by her superiors to be released from the hospital early, she resolutely "reveals the whole truth"; when Suzanne is discharged from the hospital, her companions all send her off to each other, which shows that Lanie and others have been reformed by Yvonne, and they are no longer bad children.</p>
<p>Therefore, I do not agree with the view that the romance in "The Beginning of Man" weakens the power of the theme, and that the power of reform is only Suzanne.</p>
<p>Yvonne's "sacrifice of personal happiness" is as great as Flanagan's spirit of sacrifice!</p>
<p>The acting skills of newcomer Corinne Luchaire are indeed a sign of Alexander Korda's wise eye for talent. From beginning to end, from a stubborn, wild child to being reformed, and privately falling in love with Georges and pleading guilty to Yvonne, she changes her different personalities in the appropriate process, without exceeding or falling short. Mathilde Théré's Émile and Annie Ducaux's Yvonne were also successful. Only Georges Barettes, who played Georges, was a little weak.</p>
<h3 id="e78">"Maginot Line" and "Glamorous Star" <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— (Li Zhihua)</p>
<p>This time, the Cathay Theater's program combines the newsreel "Maginot Line" with the feature film "Glamorous Star." This can be interpreted in two ways. One is that "the progress of the times" has reached a stage where great changes are happening, and it is impossible to turn a deaf ear to it. Therefore, the French Maginot Line, known as one of the strongest national defense lines, has been promoted. The other is that the protagonist of "Glamorous Star," John Barrymore, is an aging artist. Old things are worthless. Although he was once famous, now he has to rely on newsreels like the Maginot Line to help as a selling point. This really makes people sigh, "Ah, aging artist!"</p>
<p>The Maginot Line newsreel has two reels. Of course, because it "concerns military secrets," it will not show us the whole picture. However, comparing "Maginot Line" and "Glamorous Star," I would choose "Maginot Line." The reason is very simple. Although this newsreel is not "artistic" enough, it has a close connection to the world we live in. People need to survive to enjoy things. This is why I would rather like it; it's not just because it enriches my knowledge a little.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the Maginot Line is not our Chinese "Maginot Line" newsreel, and it only has a little demonstrative nature. But since every country cannot be isolated and closed off, and China is now playing an important role, we cannot help but feel that we should pay close attention to the French national defense, which is one of the allies of the peace front. Of course, it's not our own, but at least it's our friend's.</p>
<p>As for "Glamorous Star," perhaps I didn't have much hope when I went to see it, so I wasn't too disappointed. The harmonious joy within the family makes people feel the warmth and loveliness of the world. The sudden rise of a muddlehead is indeed a thorn in one's side, but it also gives one a sense of jumping out of nowhere.</p>
<p>John Barrymore's acting still has that theatrical feel. These movements would be very good on stage, but through the exquisite "eye-myra-eye" technique, it becomes fiery. Peter Holden and Virginia Weidler are a promising child duo, especially the seven-year-old Peter. With good training, he will not lose to Mickey Rooney and others.</p>
<p>The director is not bad, especially in writing the children's scenes with Peter and Virginia, which have a unique touch.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: The Red Powder Eliminates Enmity but Cannot Erase Sin; Talking of Love in the Green Window, Renewing Good Fortune</p>
<p>But they thought that a dancer is, after all, just a dancer. Old Man Pan is now a rich man, with high status and lots of money. In the eyes of the dancers, marrying him would mean enjoying endless wealth. However, Ling Xiaohua thought, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger?" Otherwise, there are many handsome young men who love her, so why reject them and instead follow an old man, Pan? It is because she wants to avenge. For the sake of revenge, as long as the goal is achieved, anything is possible. The so-called only seeking the goal, not questioning the means, is often the case with revolutionaries. Moreover, Ling Xiaohua's goal is not only on Old Man Pan; her goal is beyond Old Man Pan, because Old Man Pan is very close to a group of people she hates. She can find opportunities with Old Man Pan to achieve her revenge goal. Her meaning is clear to everyone in the group who are her comrades. Her sacrifice of her beauty and her contribution of her chastity allow the people in the group to pity her, respect her, and are willing to help her. Although she felt stimulated after seeing Fei Gongren assassinate the tiger, she did not regard Old Man Pan as the tiger in her mind; she had a different tiger in her mind. It just so happened that the opportunity came that day. She knew that Old Man Pan had invited someone to his house, and this person was the tiger in Ling Xiaohua's mind. She arranged for two practitioners from the group to act at that time, and everything was arranged, which can be regarded as internal and external cooperation. When the time came, Old Man Pan was very respectfully flattering, but two people came in and fired a few shots at them. As a result, Old Man Pan was finished, and the tiger in Ling Xiaohua's mind was only stabbed half to death. Fortunately, the two people left calmly and were not captured. After Old Man Pan's death, Ling Xiaohua naturally could no longer stay in the Pan family. She still focused on thinking about the tiger in her mind, which need not be detailed. Old Man Pan worked hard for several years, bearing the bad name of a traitor. In the end, he died before his time. After his death, Pei Ying went to search his remaining documents and found two letters that Zhao Letian had written to Pei Ying at the end. Only then did she know that after she wrote that reply, Zhao Letian had written letters to her, but they were intercepted by her father. Although I rejected him so coldly, he still had lingering feelings, and even his criticism was sincere. The second letter said that he would soon hear the news of Zhao Letian's sacrifice for the country, and Zhao Letian really sacrificed for the country soon. Could it be that my cold rejection letter gave him a stimulus and had something to do with his death? (137)</p>

<h3 id="e80">Using Films to Mobilize the Army <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Zhihua</p>
<p>From Preliminary Knowledge to Highest Technology - Realistic Scenarios, Just Like Battlefield Scenery</p>
<p>Armaments on the silver screen are usually just to seek realism and satisfy the audience's desires. However, according to the recent methods of the United States Department of the Army, they have been practically used in national defense, planning to use film technology to quickly mobilize the national volunteer army in the event of a world war, achieving unexpected victories. These films are called "Army Training Crash Course," demonstrating various necessary skills for being a soldier and fighting. Forty-two films have been produced. The content ranges from preliminary knowledge, such as measuring angles on military maps, to the highest technology, opening a 155mm coastal cannon. All things are real scenes and objects. After watching them, the general public can fully understand military knowledge.</p>
<p>The reason why the Army General Staff is doing this on such a large scale is that modern military knowledge is advancing rapidly. If there is no systematic training in peacetime, it will be difficult to surpass the enemy in wartime. Several years ago, they sent personnel to Hollywood to study photography and invited various film merchants to cooperate. Recently, they have been actively promoting it. Their actors are filled with specially trained troops, and their backgrounds include mountains, lakes, plains, and streets, depending on the subject matter. The finished films, like books, have chapters and sections. For example, the first chapter is called "Infantry Assault, Essentials," describing an infantry team crawling forward to avoid being detected by the enemy. Near the fortress, they dig trenches and quickly occupy it, and then carry out techniques such as attacking the enemy with fire. The second chapter is called "Conditions for Defending a Stronghold," explaining how to deal with tanks with concentrated artillery fire, opening machine guns, and deploying electric nets. Every step is demonstrated in slow motion, with close-ups of important parts and arrows indicating them.</p>
<p>The difference between these films and ordinary ones is that they do not mix in fantasy or gimmicks, or unnecessary stimulation, to avoid losing authenticity. They seriously depict the steps of combat. Even the sounds of guns and cannons are real, and the explosion of distant and near mines is also explained with curve diagrams, shown in slow motion. At the exciting parts of the shooting, there are also shouts of praise from the officers, such as "Good shot," "Good job," "Wonderful," which raise the spirit of the audience. Each film lasts about half an hour, and 30 sets can be produced each year. Currently, the focus is on smoke warfare, field artillery application, military signal release, infantry river crossing, cavalry charge, the subtleties of hand-to-hand combat, the movement of mechanized units, and first aid for wounded soldiers. Therefore, once a war breaks out, the audience in front of the screen can immediately become soldiers on the battlefield.</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Difficult Birth of "The True Story of Ah Q" <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>Exhibition Postponed to Late July at the Golden Theater</p>
<p>The long-rumored "The True Story of Ah Q" is the most ambitious play in the charity performance plan for the theatrical world. It was originally scheduled to be co-performed by the Gonghua, Baolian, Jingwu, and Yiyou theatrical troupes around June 15th, but recently it was announced that it would be postponed. The reporter inquired with the persons in charge of the four theatrical troupes and learned the reasons for the postponement as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The venue could not be resolved, because each theater has its own shows to perform on weekdays, and the charity performance requires ten days, so they are unwilling to give up both day and night performances.</p>
<p>2.  Baolian withdrew from the performance, the reason being that they do not have enough free time.</p>
<p>As a result, "The True Story of Ah Q" almost faced the danger of miscarriage. Until yesterday, the drama committee convened the persons in charge of each theatrical troupe to discuss solutions in detail. After careful consideration, it was decided to rent the Golden Theater, and the performance period was rescheduled to between July 22nd and July 30th. As for "The True Story of Ah Q," the Gonghua, Yiyou, and Jingwu theatrical troupes will continue to work hard. Rehearsals are being held non-stop from Monday to Saturday. With this spirit of hard work and perseverance, I think this time, it will definitely not disappoint the gentlemen who are looking forward to "The True Story of Ah Q."</p>

<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The Jinmen Grand Theater is a palace of film located at the intersection of Foch Road and Avenue Road. Its architecture adopts the latest streamline design of 1939. The clarity of the lines makes every audience feel exceptionally comfortable in terms of perception. In particular, the clarity of sound and light and the spaciousness of the seats have won unanimous praise. Recently, due to the hot weather, the installation of electric fans has the disadvantage of hindering the audience's hearing. Therefore, sparing no expense and spending two months, the latest 1939-style air conditioning equipment was installed. This type of air conditioner uses the latest chemical methods to deliver scientific air conditioning that is suitable for the human body, constantly eliminating the turbid atmosphere in the theater and introducing fresh and clear air. The management of the coldness is also managed by experts who constantly change the degree of the air conditioning, so that every audience member does not feel a special difference when entering and leaving the theater, and there is no harm to the human body. The theater is scheduled to officially open the air conditioning from today (16th), undoubtedly opening a new era in western movie theaters.</p>

On the evening of the 13th, she, along with her husband Arthur Sheekman, was accompanied by Mr. Strader, an engineer from the Shanghai Telephone Company's engineering department, to visit the Celestial Music Palace on Jing'an Temple Road. The owner of the palace, Mr. Xie Baosheng, opened champagne to entertain them. Miss Stuart said: "The scale and equipment of the palace have long been famous in the West. Seeing it today, it is truly worthy of being called the highest music palace in the Far East." Miss Stuart was in a particularly good mood that day, dancing many times, and praised the preparation of Western food in the palace. The host and guests thoroughly enjoyed themselves until late at night before departing. It is heard that Mr. Xie plans to host a formal banquet during the day to formally entertain them.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>It's a pity that Sun Yukun and Hou Xirui have fallen</p>
<p>Just imagine, with his good abilities in both literary and martial arts, it would be a pity if he continues to fall, especially in today's shortage of Jing (painted-face male) roles. I remember a few years ago, when the son of the late Qing Dynasty's Prince Qing had a birthday in Tianjin, he invited Xiao Lou and Xirui to sing "Lianhuan Tao." After the play, Xiao Lou removed his makeup, washed his face, changed into casual clothes, walked to the master, greeted him, and chatted casually. Because Lao Qing and Xiao Lou were very familiar, and he had been working in the palace for many years, being a favorite in front of the Empress Dowager Cixi, he immediately ordered the princesses around him to open the boxes and take out four gold boxes with the words "Opium" written on them. They were all aged goods, and were all given to Xiao Lou. Xiao Lou accepted them in his hands, naturally full of joy. Who knew that when he arrived backstage and showed them to everyone, Mr. Hou, who was not competitive, looked very familiar with them. He thought that since Huang Tianba could get a share, I, Shi Baoerdun, should also come to the prince, hurriedly ran to the master, kowtowed, and was busy for a long time. But after kowtowing for a long time, no one recognized who he was. Later, after he identified himself, he was rewarded with two silver boxes. Although he was also very proud, everyone else looked down on him. (38)</p>

<p>Old Newspaper Reruns - Sixty-Seven Years Ago (61)</p>

<h3 id="e88">San Francisco Bans Chinese Immigrants <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The natives of San Francisco resent Chinese guests. The "Meiren Daily" of the port argues, nitpicking all the faults of the Chinese and revealing them completely, and there is even worse. The natives' resentment is deep, and the newspapers echo each other, further spreading rumors and sensationalizing. In the election of gentry and directors in the area, they always consider the arrival of Chinese people in the port to be detrimental to themselves and want to reject them. Therefore, on the second day of the previous month, they gathered the masses for intense discussion. One person first raised his voice to the crowd, saying: "What the Chinese regard as most precious are two things: one is the pigtail that is tied up, if it is cut off, they will consider it the greatest humiliation. The second is transporting the remains back to their hometowns. They must move the bones back to their hometowns even if they die in a foreign land. If we can prohibit the Chinese from growing their pigtails and prevent them from transporting coffins back, advocating these two, then the Chinese can be stopped from coming. Not only that, but the Chinese who are currently in the territory can also be ordered to return home immediately." Another gentleman named Mr. Story said: "From today onwards, we will not hire Chinese as workers." Seeing that their discussion is like this, it is not hard to imagine that the Chinese guests in the port will be treated harshly. With the case discussion concluded, the Six Major Associations, fearing that the Chinese would suffer, immediately sent a telegram to the port, widely informing the Chinese so that they would not come again.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Purchasing Eastern Carriages <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Around Shanghai's Yangjingbang, small carts come and go more and more every day, and those who ride them like them because they are invasive and fast. Now it is heard that the small carriages made in the East are even better than this. Their style is similar to Western two-wheeled carriages, but they are smaller. The matter is quite light, and it is powered by people, without having to drive horses. Westerners in Shanghai are planning to establish a company, collecting 20,000 taels of silver to purchase 9,000 of these carriages from the East, transport them to Shanghai, and rent them to the Chinese for two foreign dollars. If successful in the future, the small cart pullers can switch to pulling Eastern carriages, abandoning the old and seeking the new, and also find food. I think the cart pullers here will definitely not have the worry of unemployment.</p>
