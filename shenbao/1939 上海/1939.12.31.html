<p>社評</p>
<h3>明年的實施憲政</h3>
<p>一年容易，又是「除夕」時候。這一年來，中華民族的奮鬥史，充滿着血淚交織的字句，但亦儘多夠人興奮鼓舞的事蹟；其間如軍事上，捷報頻傳，經濟上建設多端，中外共聞，無待贅述；即在政治上，亦有足以特筆大畫的一頁，雖因一般人的集中注意於軍事開展，埋頭於戰時的艱巨生涯，遂致忽視政治，然其重要性，則為識者所共認；這就是國民參政會所建議的提早頒布憲法和定期召集國民大會兩案，已為中央所採納了。</p>
<p>中國的憲政運動，當然因時代而殊其內容，但從頭說起，已有三十多年歷史。遠的不談，單說自二十三年公布憲草初稿以來，迭經曲折，才有眉目，中央剛想於二十六年十一月十二日召開國民大會，而蘆溝橋事變突起，又歸停頓。目前抗戰方酣，軍書旁午，忽有實施憲政決議，憂心國是者乃置疑於（一）全國朝野，是否能「好整以暇」從事於國家根本大法的擬訂？（二）訓政未畢，即行憲政，是否有躐等的嫌疑？（三）憲法縱能擬訂，是否能運用自如？（四）抗戰期間，意志貴能集中，實施憲政，將不免有黨派之爭。是否有礙於全民抗戰的統一陣綫？這些疑問，自是情理之常，未可一筆抹煞之為無病呻吟；但細繹上週各報所載參政會蔣議長的說明書之後，大可釋然於懷。蔣議長認為（一）抗戰期間，更應努力建國，關於實施憲政的兩案的通過，就為奠立國家久遠穩固的基礎；（二）促成憲政和實施訓政，不但不相妨害，而且是相需相成；（三）惟其因為憲法擬訂頒布後，人民不能運用自如，所以有繼續進行訓政未完工作的必要；（四）相信大家一定不願蹈過去議會的舊習，因之對於政府施政成績的批評，務必採取積極而善意的態度。最後又鄭重指示：「憲政實施的功效，不在於憲法的條文和形式，而在於具備憲治的精神！」我們回憶抗戰開始兩年半以來，好多熱心的批評家，每每謂這次抗戰，我們的政治始終跟不上經濟，尤其跟不上軍事。如此批評，自有其論據；尤其對於中央與地方行政中的若干點，更為確切。但是不應以此懷疑於提早實施憲政，且正相反，提早實施憲政的一部分意義，也就在乎促進政治，使政治能媲美經濟軍事。吾們深信全面抗戰促成全國統一於前，今且以同樣的力量與理由，促成全民政治於後。不但促成，并且自精神上亦得因此奠定和衷共濟，公忠體國的憲治基礎。由此種種，蔣議長所謂抗戰與建國並重，訓政與憲政並行，不惟有其可能，亦且有其必要。就中國全部憲政運動史來說明現在的提早實施憲政，更可謂為一波三折而急轉直下，水到渠成而豁然開朗！實施憲政，歸政於民，這是中山先生「天下為公」的遺教，亦是革命的歸宿！六中全會決議於明年十一月十二日召集國民大會頒布憲法；又限於明年六月底以前辦定國選未竣手續。前者距今僅十月有餘，後者僅剩六月，時日如流，即在目前。雖改期展望，史多先例，亦且每每格於事實，不得不然；然這次在抗戰時期，大信所關，影響極大，當然不致再有延緩。但看參政會提案通過後，即有憲政期成會的組織，各地舉行憲政座談會的情形亦相當熱烈，可為竭力推動，從容準備的明證。在此軍事上已入主要階段之際，國際上又復波濤洶湧之時，中國政府肆應內外，不遑寗處；乃復須以今後怱怱十個月的時間，完成實施憲政的艱巨工程。我們旣願伸述熱烈的同情，尤願預祝圓滿的成功。</p>
<h3>財政部改定　輔幣成色重量　改定一分五分十分輔幣成色　並加鑄二分輔幣定明日發行</h3>
<p>重慶　財部頃為改定一分·五分·十分輔幣成色重量、並加鑄二分輔幣、通電各省市府云（銜路）輔幣為零星交易之媒介、民間需要至殷、近年以來、鑄幣主要原料價格增漲、歐戰再起、五金市價益形增鉅、遂致輔幣實值、突然超過法值一倍、囤積镕燬、牟利之風、不可遏止、甚且輾轉偷運資日、為保持輔幣流通、兼杜奸人凱覦非法利潤、必須修改輔幣條例、將各種輔幣成色重量、予以調整、以利流通、經擬具改定一分五分十分輔幣成色重量方案、再加鑄二分輔幣一種、提請行政院會決議通過、交立法院審議行知到部、查修正輔幣條例、旣奉國防最高委員會通過、是原則業已決定、亟應提前鑄發、以利周轉、除電飭中央造幣廠、卽日開鑄、定於二十九年元旦發行、並呈請行政院備案曁分行外、相應檢附修正輔幣條例第二第三及第五條條文、電請查照、飭屬一體知照、並布告週知為何、財政部渝財印、（卅日電）</p>

<h3>孫科追述　歐洲情形</h3>
<p>重慶　十二月廿三日立法院長孫科、在中蘇文化恊會、國際和平運動會中國支會、及中國人民外交恊會聯席會議中、發表演說、其原文已於今日發表、內容所述歐戰前各國之談判情形、多有為迄今尚未公布者、孫氏追述德國</p>
<p>兼併捷克</p>
<p>後之發展情形云、蘇外長李維諾夫、當時曾提議召集英·法·蘇·波·及羅馬尼亞五國會議、解决東歐局勢、英相張伯倫答以時機尚未成熟、並建議蘇聯保證波蘭及羅馬尼亞之獨立、以代替此項會議、</p>
<p>李維諾夫</p>
<p>則建議英·法·蘇·三國聯合保證歐洲之和平、渠行抵莫斯科時、英法蘇三國之談判正在開始、此項談判、因英國根據波蘭之態度、拒絕蘇聯所提蘇軍開入波蘭、俾予波以有效之保證、以抵抗侵略之條件、</p>
<p>遂告失敗</p>
<p>蘇聯繼乃提出愛托尼亞·拉特維亞·及立陶宛三國之安全保證問題、英國堅持以上數小國須保守中立、同時更主張蘇聯保證比·荷·及瑞士之安全、蘇聯不允、並提議英法派全權代表至莫斯科談判、迨談判失敗、蘇聯新外長、</p>
<p>莫洛托夫</p>
<p>又提議開始三國間之參謀談話、主張英法兩國派遣葛特子爵及甘茂林將軍、與蘇聯國防委員長伏羅希洛夫共商各項事件、不料英法竟另派他人前往、且未携帶正當之委任狀、至英法代表</p>
<p>到莫斯科</p>

<h3>蘇軍十五萬增援　準備採取大規模攻勢　利用飛機運兵擾亂芬後方交通　芬敢死隊衝入茂曼斯克鐵路綫</h3>
<p>丹麥京城　據此間自芬京方面今日傳來消息稱、蘇方現正調集西比利亞與高加索區之紅軍十五萬名、配置於喀萊里至土腰方面、以作突破孟納興防綫之用、又列寗格勒方面更集中大批飛機、以便與生力軍互相配合、對孟納興綫作大規模之攻勢、（三十日合衆社電）</p>
<p>芬京　蘇軍十萬人昨日猛攻孟納興防綫、整日以重砲向芬軍不斷射擊、蘇軍主力係向維波爾進攻、維波爾為芬蘭第三大城、旣為重要工業區、並為航運中心點、蘇軍攻孟納興左翼已有三星期之久、現已改變戰略、由維波爾向右翼進攻、蘇機於夜間載運蘇軍於芬軍後方駕降落傘落下、皆衣芬軍服裝、企圖於芬軍後方活動、破壞橋樑及交通路綫等、蘇軍此項戰術、應用之效率遠較他國為佳、余前於莫斯科曾觀彼等表演、一千人同時落下、間有小型坦克車亦利用此法降下、芬軍現正對蘇軍此項戰術加以密切注意、芬境內湖沼甚多、但現皆冰凍、預料一待天氣轉暖、冰塊溶化後、蘇軍即不能再用此項戰術、據余所知、芬軍陣地各處皆有密探、察視每個人民之行動、各重要路綫及橋樑日夜皆有兵卒守衛、（三十日合衆社電）</p>
<p>芬京　蘇聯軍艦數艘、連日在芬蘭灣用射程甚遠之大砲、轟擊芬蘭維波爾港、但自二十四小時以來、砲火業已停止、此外、蘇聯陸軍砲隊雖在喀萊里亞地峽方面轟擊芬蘭軍陣地、但因芬蘭軍防禦工事極為堅固、益以偽裝甚佳、以致所發砲彈均未命中云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間今日接瑞典京城來訊稱、芬軍一隊已抵列寗格勒通至茂曼斯克之鐵路、該鐵路已毀　、運輸阻斷、故蘇軍之食糧給養已告停頓、茂曼斯克已一度發生譁變、蘇軍陣綫後有砲聲、致起蘇軍譁變之謠諑云、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社軍事訪員電稱、如芬蘭敢死隊突入蘇軍陣綫而截斷茂曼斯克之說證明屬實、則北部蘇軍將有給養中斷之虞、蘇方供應組織向不良好、重要鐵路之交通阻斷縱屬暫時、亦將使蘇軍發生潰散、與疆塲崩潰無殊、此薄弱之鐵路綫、自列寗格勒蜿蜓過康達拉煦卡而至北冰洋、其某一點距芬蘭邊陲僅四十哩、極易遭受攻擊、茍此點一破、則蘇軍司令與其在中部及北部前綫作戰紅軍間之交通、將不能維持矣、芬方在蘇軍陣綫上擲發之傳單、允對蘇方逃兵給予重賞者已獲響應、故蘇軍隊伍中之發生暴動乃可能事、因蘇軍目前似已頹喪也云、（二十九日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　芬京傳來半官消息稱、北部前敵蕯拉區之蘇軍陣綫中又起譁變、蘇方軍用機不得不對該區本國軍隊投彈轟炸、並用機關槍掃射之、聞蘇軍步兵隊自相激戰、其殘殺時、芬方能聞其叫喊之聲云、（二十九日路透電）</p>

<p>瑞典京城　柏林現有一般的印象、以為德蘇對於支配北方進發之條件、已互換意見、瑞京日報稱、吾人預料德蘇已完全合作、此說確與事實不甚懸殊、雙方業已議定、斯堪的那維亞半島諸國不能為對芬援助之途徑、否則唯有認為已放棄其中立、綜之、目前環境不外乎此半島對芬援助之形式、將為德蘇判定半島諸國破壞中立與否之標準、預料德蘇指摘該半島諸國破壞中立之言論、不久即將發生云、（二十九日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　路透社海軍訪員稱、英戰艦一艘被魚雷擊中僅受輕傷事、頗引起猜測、上次大戰中大軍艦四週輒有鋼絲魚雷綱之設備、後因戰時運用不靈乃廢除之、而代以護艦物、此物置於艦側、庶魚雷僅能於真正艦身之外爆炸、而損毀程度不過使軍艦减少速率一海哩耳、此物顯為防禦魚雷之要具、而避免軍艦重要部份之損毀、自上次歐戰以還、此護艦物已大有進步、凡置有此物之軍艦、可抵抗魚雷之屢次攻擊云、（三十日路透電）</p>

<h3>川康邊區　猓猓族的生活狀態　團結在各深山之中　約計有五百餘萬衆</h3>
<p>成都通訊、金陵大學教務長兼社會學系主任柯象峯、爲研究大凉山猓猓族社會生活實况、月前赴四川西南部各縣考察、足跡歷眉山·峨嵋·龍池·沙坪·峨邊·馬邊諸地、蒐集材料及標本、至爲豐富、據柯氏所談川省西南邊區猓猓族生活實况如次、</p>
<p>猓猓族、卽俗所稱之「夷族」、散居川省西南部之雷波·峨邊·屛山·犍爲·及西康之西昌·越巂·昭覺·鹽源·會理·德昌·冕寗·諸縣、因文化落後、鮮與外界交通、共散佈確實數目、的五百餘萬、據當地人估計、川康一帶之夷族、最少在一百萬以上、猓猓族之中、又可別爲兩種、一爲黑猓猓、此輩文化最低、一爲白猓猓、多屬未開化之漢人、文化較黑猓猓稍高、</p>
<p>黑猓猓吃的問題、因他們所居的地帶、多屬崇山峻嶺、只能種玉蜀黍、不宜於種稻麥、故悉以玉蜀黍爲主要食糧、間有種蕎麥者、惟數量極少、種稻米者、允不多見、副食品爲洋芋·豆子·蔬菜、肉類以豬羊肉爲主、牛肉雞肉及野肉爲副食、日進二餐、晨八九時許早餐、黃昏時晚餐、因尚未用油燈、黑夜缺火光、故餐後卽就寢、習以爲常、穿的方面、以羊毛織品爲主、男人常用者爲白羊毛織成之披肩、將全身包裏、不分寒暖悉御之、披肩有白·藍·紅·各種顏色、女人不穿褲、只掛裙上衣爲左袵、尚存太古之風、亦爲羊毛織成、四季不換、羶氣難聞、住的問題、亦極簡單、以土爲牆、以樹皮爲瓦、聊蔽風雨、亦有以竹簾爲牆者、席地而臥、已成習慣、</p>
<p>該族婚姻風俗、至爲奇怪、婚姻的程序、先由媒妁介紹、自然是竹門對竹門、木門對木門、經兩方家長許可後、卽行訂婚、訂婚時禮物、以牲畜爲主、稍富裕者牲畜較多、反之、則寥寥豬羊數頭、便算了事、結婚前夕、兩家親戚麕集、於是男家派代表一人、逕赴女家把新娘揹回來、當這位代表到女家門口之際、全家人卽持盆托鉢、滿盛冷水、向他身上潑去、代表雖變成落湯之雞、還不許他進門、最後潑水的人們、把木灰抹黑他的面孔、變成了「大花面將軍」、才許他入門、當晚、女家的客人們痛飲一塲、幷狂吃豆渣、酒後、酣歌曼舞、當唱至離情別調、心神傷感之際、卽放聲痛哭、鬧至黎明、代表便把新娘揹走、男家當夜亦有一番宴祝熱鬧、惟新娘當天卽偕新郎回至女家、或經二三年後、新娘始回至男家、開始同居生活、把新郎稱爲名義上的丈夫、亦無不可也、</p>
<p>他們並沒有正式的組織、似尚爲一種宗族主義、族長名之「黑骨頭」、有支配全族的權力、彷彿古代的酋長、亦有他們的文字、字形頗似藏文、但發音逈異、當族長發佈命令時、將全文字書木板上、遍傳各戶、幷有定期集市、彼此交易、不時將牛皮·羊皮·藥材·牲口·野獸·蜂蜜·到漢人地帶、交換食鹽布疋等物、食鹽爲他們的高貴食品、非貴賓惠臨時、決不招待、他們有銀匠·銅匠·鐵匠等、可製造粗的金屬飾物、學校一無所有、獉獉狉狉、智識未開、缺乏國家民族意識、殊爲可惜、</p>
<p>他們雖在未開化時代、且隔絕與外界通婚、不易感化、惟他們體格強健、性情蠻悍、允富團結力、當其與外族械鬬之際、雖有新仇舊恨、莫不消除成見、一致對外、故猓猓族依然能存在至今、且人口還在繼續增長中、倘能把他們加以訓練、灌注愛國智識、組織成軍、當爲抗敵之一支健強部隊、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、差強人意、按上日之潛勢、及本日滙市之帶緊、續漲數十元非意外也、豈料結果反小三元、良因明後三天爲國曆新年、連今日星期共有四天假期、使一般浮多極願薄利了結、加以港帮吃胃孱弱、雖某外銀行暗中收買二千兩之多、奈供求仍艱相敵、惟晨開承上日餘風又漲十二元、爲四千一百七十元、後雖一度回落、但某錢兌業忽代外行猛搜、同時某銀號亦來跟進、再以滙市略形緊軟、故一度會拉高、達四千一百八十五元、豈料價高反而引起賣風、錢兌業首來出籠、繼以證券帮金號銀樓帮等莫不爭先吐出、迄至午收前竟已退達四千一百五十元低價、結果以四千一百五十五元牧盤、午後塲內無市、而塲外趨勢轉穩、四千一百六十元尚難買進、聞售者須再高十元、成交則鮮聞做開、至上午交易的達三千兩之上、銀樓飾金未更、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤挫落三元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開外滙雖平、惟局勢尚佳、開市即做高十二元、證券帮進金號二十兩、爲四千一百七十元、少頃另一證券帮及金號等賣出、立撳小十元、證券帮吐予錢兌業十兩、爲四千一百六十元、此後某錢兌業吸胃陡強、同時某銀號亦代客撈入、且以滙市略形緊軟、故證券帮金號及銀樓帮等雖均有供意、但莫不乘機扳價、始被抬起二十五元、錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千一百八十五元、嗣因買者吃胃已飽、加之另一錢兌業突代本帮獲利出籠、不久即回落二十元、錢兌業出證券帮三十兩、爲四千一百六十五元、後金號等趁低撈進、復提起十元、金號進錢兌業三十兩、爲四千一百七十五元、旋以錢兌業見高又來吐出、且金號忽又轉賣風、一時散戶多頭紛紛了結、回挫二十五元、金號售予證券帮十兩、爲四千一百五十元、後證券帮又稍拖入、遂提高五元、進金號二十兩、爲四千一百五十五元作午收價、結果比上日軋小三元、半天三十五元差度、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金始終不動</p>

<h3>煤炭　印煤銷路日盛</h3>
<p>印度烟煤、自前日開　公司暫停出售棧單以來、印度塊獨步春申、銷路日盛、每日做開達千餘噸、行盤一週內加起十元、貨主尚不肯輕脫、意存看好、本街門莊、喀爾喀塔塊母噸已喊一百三十二元、尚無大批現貨、與銷路呆滯之火爐白煤、適成反比例云、</p>
<h3>糧食　滬上民食可告無虞　洋米又到四萬餘包　碎米成交一千七百噸　售價特廉用以辦平</h3>
<p>前者所到之大批早晚稻、昨仍在大量拋出、且聞後批若黃橋及汆來廟等貨十三車、亦已抵達虹口、不過能吾於昨日由該區轉出、尚屬問題、途貨洋米續有運到、早市一般人心、猶在看好、無論本鄉店胃俱各暢辦、售方遂乘機喊高半元有奇、若南港早晚稻價爲三十八元半、西貢尖三十八元、當時形勢殊屬栗碌、但後終以大結束期近在咫尺、客販更番拋出、市貨頓見充斥、作客見籌碼湧旺、豈肯貿然再進、所以一動即懈、銷塲立滯、市面遂難立足、反昂回疲、結果收盤行情、南港早晚稻高三十八元二角、次至三十七元九角、西貢尖爲三十七元半至三十七元二角、暹邏尖三十七元六角至三十七元三角、碎米三十三元、東京尖特別三十六元二角、市貨三十五元决三十四元、較前市雖猶挺秀、然僅增二三角而已、餘如蘇同粳仍爲四十元、决至三十九元、靑泗特薄四十元、市三十九元半、楓喜特薄三十九元、决至三十八元、蘆羊尖三十八九元、白元四十一二元、則以價格比他貨爲貴、且都已齊限、是乃不易提升、祇呈平定之局、其中雖貨品優劣未免較有參差、然亦微末不足論、統計全市成交仍屬有限、爲數最多不逾五千包耳、</p>
<p>客秈續形沉寂、洋米買氣愈旺、因年假封關、舖作鄉客頗多添補、而定貨又以休假不開、新到尚須有待、貨方售價均爲喊高、西貢暹邏均昂至三十七元半、高碎米開到三十三元二角、比之前日又回好三五角、路貨與原包均乏售出、惟行號爲促成平糶起見、乃照市减低售與調節協會二號西貢及碎米各一批、合計一千七百噸、二號原包四十三元八角、碎米原包三十五元八角云、</p>
<p>洋米不斷進口、昨日太古公司責陽輪、自西貢直接運來五千零八十五包、由香港裝來一萬二千四百四十七包、又該公司廣東輪亦自香港運來一萬三千二百十九包、叉有怡和洋行永生輪自香港裝來一萬零零六十二包、另有一千七百十一包、轉往天津、三輪均於昨日午前先後抵埠、現在起卸中、（祖）</p>

<h3>證券　內債看好　外股仍堅</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日祇做半日交易、午後即行辦理交割停市、半日市况、趨勢堪稱穩定、大都因年關關係、有四日休假、浮多浮空以求暫行結束、消息方面即金幣券之發行亦與公債無關、但以散戶了結居多、故亦有四十萬交易買賣、雙方仍以買戶佔優勢、因各國大使不久將羣集重慶、與中日事不關係、明年紅盤當繼續看好、昨半日結果、微升一二角左右、成交的四十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>今日星期例假元旦起休假三天、四日起照常開市</p>

<p>倫敦二十九日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍告平定、上下檔各價券均無變動、倫敦二十九日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、祇滙豐銀行股各降一鎊、英倫註冊股價爲八十一鎊半、香港註冊股價爲八十鎊、其餘平平、</p>
<h3>紗花　囤戶活動　紗價直上　飛漲十元左右</h3>
<p>紗市續趨前進、形勢反見熱烈、查市塲之成交、百分之八十含投機性質交易、皆係一二月及二月份之廠根交易、專門在市買來買去、熱鬧非凡、實際銷路、依然沉悶、所以存底日增、不過原棉堅昂、囤戶買意依然濃厚也、市塲自二十九年元旦日起休假三天、至一月四日開市、照常營業、</p>
<p>現紗晨開以美印棉市復趨上騰、且又有謠言利多、買者益衆、二十支雙馬開價爲七百五十元、比上日漲七元、頃刻漲至五十三元、旅即聞外匯開出無大變遷、一霎間回跌至七百四十八元、但某豐號對於一二月期貨稍有收進、形勢轉昂、又復上升、紗市在五十二三元之間、盤旋甚久、迨至收盤價爲七百五十三元半、查半日閒成交統計一千五百八十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲十元〇五角、天女漲八元、雙地球漲六元、今日有棉紗九十五件運香港、又明年一月一日有紗五百五十五件運暹羅、二百八十件運西貢、二百二十件運土樂、四十件運海防、三十件運海口、六十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>同行一、二〇〇　內地　二五</p>
<h3>外棉又告上騰　花號心思看好</h3>
<p>本棉交易較稀、廠方仍以日商上海廠有一筆成交、共他未聞採辦、但人心異常激昂、此因海外印棉叉轉上風、所以同行心思重復看升矣、蘇北來源、計通花三千三百七十包、常陰沙丸百四十一包、北沙來八百三十包、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>

<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊見靜寂、各方俱無進胃、凡藏有現貨、暫時均不願出售、蓋因彼等深信美棉市况又將看好也、廠方以年關屆臨、準備結帳、故交易殊鮮、茲將昨日棉市以美匯七元半折合送廠價列下、</p>

<p>越界築特之管轄權問題之發展而定、該發言人並稱關於蘇州河以北地帶之問題、本當早已解決、但因八月中金洛克事件、以及其他種種不幸事件之發生、故延遲至今、</p>
<p>尙未解決但若越界築路之管轄權問題能獲得解決。則虹口問題目晚解決、現在「上海市政府」與工部局雙方舉行之談話、進行甚佳、故此亦係虹口問題能早日解決之預兆也、又英文大美晚報云、「上海市長」傳筱庵經</p>
<p>義總領事兼上海領袖領事尼隆之特殊請求後、已九對越界築詐路上汽車微收照會費事、復行展緩、聞傳氏致尼隆之復函中稱、徵收此費、無定期展緩、但「上海市府」有隨時發出通告之十五日後、</p>

<h3>明日</h3>
<p>每年最末的一天，叫作除夕，意思是除舊換新，這是大家知道。每年最末的一月亦叫除月，見梁元帝纂要一書，用者不多。所以今天是除月除夕。</p>
<p>過了二十四小時，就是「明日」，但在今日說「明日」，如果意思廣義的，也可以說「明年」。譬如與朋友分別時，「明日再會」！換作「明年再會」！在邏輯上是一點不差，此時「日」與「年」是通用了</p>
<p>明年當然有一番新的氣象，新的發展，我們不能預料；但我們已知道的，譬如桂林設市，過分利得稅徵收，節的建國儲蓄運動，都於明年元旦日開始，也就是「明日」開始</p>
<h3>歐戰與間諜活動</h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>在第一次歐戰以後，各國的間諜，是非常活動的。他們的行動，常是變化莫測防不勝防。外表雖然平凡，而其手段非常敏活，注意十分深刻，他們能想盡種種的方法，完成其重要的任務。下列各則，不過略舉例子而已。</p>
<p>某國大使館雇傭一個女人，面貌醜陋，每日祖任拭窗工作，該館對於間諜，素來防備很嚴，任何人工作完畢，不許携出一物。但該婦女實係一間諜，她在拭玻窗時，用五種秘密動作，在玻窗上，一左一　右，一上一下一斜地揩拭。另一閒諜，便在遠處，看她的動作，即速紀錄下來，所以該館的一切機密，完全被她竊去。</p>
<p>蘇聯有一個間諜，專利用照相器具，他住在英政府辦公廳附近的洋房內，而在空中攝取附近一切的垃圾紙片，據說英國政府的機密被他這樣竊去的也不少。</p>
<p>另一蘇聯閒諜，却利用煮卵的方法，此種卵混於普通生卯中，外面敷以砂糖明礬液，內部則以藥液書寫文字，此卵一旦煮熟，便現出黑色文字。</p>
<p>法國閒諜，很多美女，她們的手套，大衣袋，以及衣服夾縫中，都是藏置秘密電文的處所。</p>
<p>自從赤外光綫燈發明以後，各國閒諜都知道利用以放射晤號，在數哩之外，可以獲得消息。其他科學方法，更不勝枚舉。</p>
<h3>假如戰綫一千公里……</h3>
<p>假如戰綫長一千公里，則攻守雙方的人力，財力，物力需要若干？</p>
<p>攻的一方，兵力至少需四百萬，防的則自一百五十萬至二百萬，而前綫兵士，均需後方的勞動力運輸給養，防軍每一兵士，的需十人，攻軍每一兵士的需十二人，所以欲使四百萬攻軍順利進行，後方就需要四千八百萬的勞動者。</p>
<p>在大戰爭時，每年需要四萬萬噸的煤，如果每一鑛工每日能掘煤〇，八噸，那末就需五萬萬的人口。</p>
<p>就武器而論，攻軍所需要的爲：——</p>
<p>機關槍　二十萬支大砲四萬五千</p>
<p>步槍　三萬支　高射砲五萬架</p>
<p>裝甲車　四萬具　運輸車三萬具</p>
<p>守的一方大體爲攻軍的一半。</p>
<p>於是再計算其武器砲彈等每年所需要的鋼鐵：——</p>
<p>攻軍方面的計三千七百三十萬噸，防軍方面爲一千五百七十五萬噸。換句話說，每一個兵士，每年鍘鐵七－八萬噸。</p>
<p>此外不可缺的物質列表於下：——</p>
<p>所以戰爭眞是勞民傷財的，尤其是侵略國家，假如投機不着，遇到了強有力的抗戰，他的損失，一定要比被侵略國大過一倍，甚至三四倍。</p>
<h3>歐戰的發動者</h3>
<h3>明年的星期計算法</h3>
<p>計算明年某日爲星期幾，極爲便利。只須自一月一日起至某日止，一共幾天。（月大月小在陽曆爲一定，極易計算。）以七除之，餘數即是星期幾。若無餘數，即是星期日。</p>
<p>舉例如下：三月十五日爲星期幾？正月卅一日，二月是閏年爲廿九日（何年爲閏年，亦有一定，見文中。）三月十五日共七十五日，以七除之餘五，即係星期五。</p>
<h3>受寵若驚</h3>
<p>— 浣蘭</p>
<p>一九三九年十一月份的Ｔime雜誌上，登着一篇Agreable　Surprise　頗值一讀；並且把這題目譯成中文成語，可以說沒有走樣。下面是譯文</p>
<p>一九三九年十月梢，諾貝爾科學獎金委員會在荷京斯多克霍爾姆，宣佈一九三八年是前年積擱下來的）及一九三九年生理學及醫學獎金。應受獎金的生理學家是比國康納而海蠻教授（Corneille　Heymans）他發明由刺激引起的血壓高低及化學變化，應響呼吸，這些貢獻，是裨益醫治呼吸器病不少。</p>
<p>醫藥的獎金給德國革哈特多馬克教授（Gerbard　Domak　這就發生了問題，原來在一九三五年諾氏獎金給德國肺癆專家阿設斯開時，希持拉下令以後不准德人受諾氏獎金。此次該委員會不識好歹，又揀中了一個德國人，致革哈特教授得信後，手足無措。</p>
<p>他對政府請示應如何辦理的時候，喃喃地說：「縱使不受他的獎金，但被指名的榮譽，巳使我受驚不少了」</p>
<h3>芬蘭瑣談</h3>
<p>芬蘭全國有湖沼六萬五千處，頗可作軍事上防禦之用。</p>
<p>芬蘭有人口四百萬。芬蘭的出口貨百分之七十五是木材。</p>
<p>在五穀收獲的時候，芬蘭人一天的工作特別辛苦，因爲彼時日落西山要下午十一時，如果「日人而憇，」則一天的時間特別長。</p>
<p>芬京海爾遜根現有人口三十萬，在一八一〇年時不過一小村而已。</p>
<p>芬蘭文，爲世界上最難學的文字之一。</p>
<h3>關於地球的常識</h3>
<p>— 振明</p>
<p>地球到太陽的路程有九千二百八十三萬英里，乘現在最快的飛機，每小時二百四十哩，不分畫夜不絕飛去要四十四</p>
<p>地球到月亮的路程有二十三萬九千英哩，如果一樣乘飛機飛去，要四十幾天。</p>
<p>地球的中心是液體的，外部地殼層的厚度有五十公里。</p>
<p>空氣至少有一百公里厚，每一立方公尺，的重一·二九公斤，地面上每一平方公分面積要受到一·〇三三公斤的空氣壓力。</p>
<p>小考據</p>
<h3>雪茄烟上面　紙箍的來歷</h3>
<p>雪茄烟上面，不是都圍有腰帶般的一道紙箍嗎？包的式樣很美觀，但究竟作何用處，却都莫明其妙。據說這小小紙箍的來歷，却與女性有關呢。</p>
<p>原來在殖民時代，古巴的西班牙貴族婦人，大都很隨便的抽吸雪茄，藉以表示高貴和寫意，但同時却恐怕烟葉的顏色，玷汚了她們雪白的手指。因此在雪茄烟的上面，加上一道紙箍，爲的是可以保護手指，俾可不致與烟葉相接觸。但是流傳到時現在，當初採用紙箍的原意早已不復存在了。</p>
<h3>人造食糧</h3>
<p>人造食糧的最早研究者是法國的茅來勃里斯博士，他研究了十年，到一九三〇〇年，才　把香蕉，蘋果，葡萄等鮮果製造成功了水某粉，以供飲用。</p>
<p>自從茅來勃里斯博士的水菓粉成功以後，引起了世界科學家的興趣。蘇聯的科學家最起勁，他們組織了人造食糧研究所，從一九三四年起，就開始實地研究，他們具有一種理想，想把麵包的體積縮减成白分之一，或者五十分之一，却仍舊含有着原來的營養成分，並且還可以久藏不壞。當時只是一種理想，誰都不相信會成事實的。</p>
<p>可是最近據俄文報載，莫斯科電訊：蘇聯科學家加拉伊夫Ｓ．ＹＫarayevoy氏經過五年之研究，終於在今年的春天成功了。這是無意中成功的，他在無意中製成了一種用化學藥品合成的可充麵包的代用品。這東西可製成粉末或藥餅，每三公分的重量，可抵黑麵包半磅，他的代價，僅及半磅黑麵包的十五至二十分之一</p>
<p>人造食糧的成功，不但是科學界的一大發明，抑且是生存競爭上的一大革命哩！</p>

<h3>民國二十八年的終結語</h3>
<p>— 戎美</p>
<p>今天是民國二十八年的最後一天，日子過得眞快，明年的元旦似乎就在眼前，沒有一些模糊，一霎眼便是年底，道一年長長的三百六十五日又這樣的飛去了。</p>
<p>一切公共或私家的機關，到了今天，便把一年中的收支，都作一年底的結帳，那便引起了我們的回憶。</p>
<p>在這一年裏，第二次的歐戰竟可怖的爆發了。雖然現在處於戰爭狀態之下，僅有英，法，芬，德，蘇五國，然而星星之火可以燎原，那戰火很有蔓延的可能，可是我們愛好公正的和平的人們，總希望和平之神早日降臨，更可憐歐戰後復國的波蘭，竟在今年被侵略者呑沒了。我國的抗戰已進入了緊張的階段。總之，今年是烽火彌天的一年，給我們一個「抵抗侵略，才能生存」的教訓。</p>
<p>在這一年裏，上海包圍在投機和囤積的風氣中，百物的價格依着直綫的飛漲，而引成了貧者益貧，富者益富的趨勢。總之，今年是物價飛漲的一年，但也可以養成我們節省的習慣。</p>
<p>最後，小朋友們在今天也有結帳的必要，把自己在這一年裏作一番簡略的檢討：你們年紀又大了一歲，我想你們的父母一定是很愛護你們，做新衣服給你穿，拿糖果給你吃，把錢給你用，買玩具給你玩，可是你在學校裏是不是用功讀書？多認識了幾個生字嗎？多長進了一些智識嗎？如果是不的話，那你太對不住你的父母了。因為他們倆老人家能這樣的愛護你們，就是希望你們好好地用功讀書，可以說他們倆的心，時時刻刻在你們身上，你們怎能不用功讀書去報答他們呢？</p>
<p>這幾句膚淺的話，可算是我午底的禮品。各位小朋友們，看了這上列的幾句，不可當作檢討的檢討，盼望你們有則改之，無則加勉！更祝你們新年快樂！</p>
<h3>新希望</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>一年過去了，明天又將是另一年的開始，跟着我們亦不能不有一些新的希望，來作為我們未來一年中的開路者。我可以說，你們的新希望一定是多得很，下面的數種，是逃不了的。</p>
<p>第一，對於倘人方面，希望加倍努力來學，希望體格日漸強健，希望品性日臻優良。</p>
<p>第二，對於國家方面，希望抗戰勝利，希望國土完整，希望民生愉快。</p>
<p>第三，對於世界方面，希望各國能够以誠相待，希望天下得以太平。</p>
<p>有這些希望的小朋友，是前進的，是好的。可是，筆者認為以上這一切還不是新的希望，各位一定要問：「為什麼？」，我且等一下回答，我先要問你們一句話：「各位在去年過新年時，總亦發表過一些新希望吧，請你們拿來與今年的對一對看，有沒有相同之點？一這時候各位定恍然大悟，原來所謂你們的「新希望」，已是幾年的陳貨了。說至此，就讓筆者來提出一種眞的新希望吧，這亦簡單得很，就是希望你們能够從今日起把以前你們所已有的希望一步步拿來實現，做成事實，切莫讓它變成「空想」，或「幻想」，而再一年年的遺傳下去，這幾句話，就算拿來作為我送給各位的新年禮物，請各位能够誠意接下。</p>
<h3>孫中山先生　元旦不讀書</h3>
<p>— 陳思悌</p>
<p>小朋友位：光陰是過得非常迅速，眨眨眼，今天巳是民國二十八年的最後一天了；從明天起，就是二十九年的開始了，現在，我寫了一個孫中山先生元旦不忘讀書的故事，作爲送給小朋友們的一份新所薄禮吧！</p>
<p>當中山先生在日本時，某年元旦，他的友人來約他去遊山，那時，中山先生正埋首案頭，孜孜研讀，看見好來約，就說：「現在國事蜩螗一心只在革命，不在山水之間」；却之不願去。他的友人又對他說：「今天是元旦假日，難道不可出去一遊嗎』？中山先生就笑答道：「只因在這假日，才有一些續書的機會，才能求得一些智識，假使不在假日，那末即是研究國事，也感到沒在片刻空間呢」！中山先生在元旦日尙且不忘諱，你想多麽可敬呀！</p>
<p>小朋友們：上面這樣的一個短短的故事，當你們贖了之後，有什麼感想呢？</p>
<h3>過年的傳說</h3>
<p>— 申</p>
<p>據說，在四千多年的時候，世界上有一種物，名叫年。這種動物很大，性喜冷，在每一年的終了，與第二年開始的那一夜，他就要出來吃人；所以，那時候的人，，都是存有懼怕之人，並且沒有一個方法來制阻他的活動。於是在這時，大家就把他當做一個關，就是現在所說的「年關」；又因為逃過了未被年吃掉的緣故，所以就把第二年的第一天，叫做：「新年」。後來人類漸漸的聽明了；，想了一個法子，就是在新年的前夕，大家掛了紅色的東西，因爲年是最怕紅色，所以這一家倘掛了紅色的東西，年就不敢近了，於是人類得了較安定的生活。所以直到現在舊式的家庭中，還在門外，或臥房外，掛着紅色的布門簾，或在房門上塗有紅色的漆，但他們是以為吉慶，其實是弄錯了。又為什麽在一年的開始的第一日要說恭喜恭喜呢？這是因為互相慶賀，沒有被年吃掉的緣故；又為什麽要辦很多菜呢？因為年雖然性喜吃人，但與有美味好菜也不肯捨棄，所以人類利用這個原因，使年見美食而忘掉吃人的事，在他吃菜的時候，人類就可以逃去，以免於一死。後來因為年的生殖力低弱，所以漸漸消滅了，到現在年已經沒有了。但過去的防預步驟，到現在還存留着；但因為年沒有了，所以有很多的東西由自己享用。如菜是為自己所吃，掛紅是表示四季平安，萬事如意，五相慶賀是為了大家又多活了一年，所以現在的過年意義，與從前過年的意義已不同了！祇好與端午節為記念屈原而自食粽子，中秋節爲記念嫦娥而自食月餅，彼此並行了。</p>
<h3>小常識</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>光陰眞似流水一般，過了今天，一年又完畢了。我們都知道，所謂過了一年，在天文學上說，就是地球繞了太陽轉了一次，須時三百六十五天多些，究竟多幾許？各位小朋友都能回答嗎？這是一定的，多五小時四十八分四十六秒，為了這個綠故，所以每隔四年在二月裏要有一日閏日多出來。</p>
<p>以上所講的，都是從陽曆方面來算的；至於我們舊有的陰曆，則過一年要有十一二天多，所以，每五年中就多二個閏月；這是依着月亮繞地球算的。從這樣看來，陽曆比較陰曆在計算方面是準確得多了。</p>
<h3>藍矮子　（十四）</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>阿麗已記起了過去的一切，便拉雜雜地告知了那矮老人；第人家也有一搭沒一搭的說了好多的話，只是阿麗聽得不大明白，只懂得「迷路」啊「可憐的孩子」啊「可憐的孩子」啊幾句罷了。最後他告知阿麗，他也恰好從那村子裏出來，只為了要抄近路起見，所以走這條森林中的路，却不料遇到了伊。他說完了這番話之後，把那手中的燈提得高高的，分明表示他在前引路，叫阿麗跟着他走的意思。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，剛才阿麗我來我去，我不到路，如今在他老人家領導之下，不到十分鐘，就到了那小客店了。可憐伊的伯母和阿立正在為伊焦急，在店門前跑來跑去，沒有了主意。伯父同看店主人和車夫們正提着燈，到森林中找伊去了。客店主婦正在勸慰伯母，說這是不用熱心的；因為這一帶並沒有狼和熊等野獸，也沒有什麽拐騙小孩子的壞人，那小姑娘忙了一天，一定很疲倦了，睡熟在森林裏什麼地方，天明後自會回來的。</p>
<p>店主婦居然猜得一些不錯，如今阿麗回來了，但伊再也料不到這小姑娘在睡夢中會到過矮人的村子裏去，受藍矮子們款待的一回事。至於那領導伊回來的矮老頭兒，却是近邊一個有名的土著，為人是很和善的。阿麗的伯母向他道謝一番，費了他兩塊錢，他就歡天喜地的去了。過了幾分鐘，伯父趕回來，看看他的姪女兒有沒有消息，一見阿麗巳經回來，當然快樂什麽似的。</p>
<p>阿麗的回來，眞是湊巧得很，原來天明以後，天色老是暗暗地似有雨意，伊回來後不到半小時，大風雨就發作了。伯母很高興的對阿麗說道：「你幸而回來得早一些，要是這時候再不回來，豈不使我們急死嗎？」阿麗看看那門外可怕的大風雨，心中也很慶幸；當下伊將訪問藍矮的動機對伯母說了。伯母很後悔的說道：「先前我不該和你開玩笑，說了些關於矮人們的話，挑動了你的好奇心，以致弄出這個岔子來，從此我可要小心一些，不再和你們小孩子開玩笑了。」於是阿麗也告知伯母，從此看了書本裏的仙人妖怪，已很滿足，决不再去，找實在的仙人妖怪了。</p>
<p>末後伊忽又笑吟吟地說道：「伯母，但是我懊悔沒有吃到那藍矮子們的晚餐，聞了那香味，似乎大可一吃呢。」伯母笑道：「你在做夢罷了。眞的那裏吃得到。」阿麗沈吟了一下，忽又問道：「伯母，昨夜你和伯父阿立他們回來的時候，一路上可會唱過歌沒有？」伯母忙道：「唱的，他們要我唱一支「家，甜蜜的家，」我一時高興，放聲唱了起來。你為什麽問到這個？」阿麗點頭道：「唔，是了，我還當做是藍矮子們在唱呢，原來是你們的聲音。」伯母笑笑，和伊接了一個甜蜜的吻。（完）</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>元旦的話劇陣容</h3>
<p>— 金元良</p>
<p>從民國廿九年度開始，孤島劇壇，將因添了「中旅」這一支生力軍，而更加增加其活氣了吧？一年之計在於春，各劇團的一年大計，我們固然無法得悉，但從元旦公演的節目上來看，則多少也總可說看出一點端倪。</p>
<p>第一得提起的，自然是在孤島奮鬥了一年多的上海劇藝社，該社自在辣斐劇塲開始了第二期長期公演，以薩度的「祖國」爲第一砲之後，到現在賣座不衰，元旦起，以前本來有公演蔣旂編劇，白朗導演的「陳圓圓」之說，現在得到確訊，則「祖國」將演過元旦，也許在一月四日或五日才公演「陳圓圓」。</p>
<p>至於「中旅」，據該團以前宣傳，本來是公演魏如晦編劇吳永剛導演的「西太后」，該劇除唐若靑及「中旅」全體團員合演之外，還加上王熙春和劉瓊等參加客串，召座能力，自是不弱，不過現在是因爲謹愼將事，爲力求精益求精起見，在服裝道具等諸方面全力以赴，所以决計把演期展緩了，先上吳永剛編導的「林冲夜奔」，吳永剛本來編導過「林冲雪夜殲仇記」電影，博得一致好評，這决駕輕就熟，當然更是不凡，並且由該團團長唐槐秋自告奮勇，親自主演，成續之佳，當然更可預下了。唐槐秋是劇壇宿將，近年來難得登台，這一次他毅然自告奮勇，其名貴更可想而知。</p>
<p>再說綠賓，綠賣雖有人看它爲文明戲班子，但近來力爭上游，奮發振作，則實在容不得小看了他。元旦起他們原也是準備上演劉一新編導的「慈禧太后」的。後來聽說「中旅」要演，爲避免對台起見，便自動把演展到一月六日，元旦起，則獻演胡了然編劇的「鈹金小姐一。該劇據說是一個諷刺喜劇，其中並有關於攝影塲的種種穿插云。</p>
<h3>本年度上海最红的戲</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>一年又過了，今年海上劇壇特別熱鬧，較諸戰前且有過之，總計此一年中，最能號召觀衆而最紅的戲是：</p>
<p>（一）戰長沙這齣戲被周信芳師徒所唱紅，不久以前，信芳與趙如泉袁世海在處府堂會一唱，紅裏還要紅，於是這齣戲成了標準號召戲，周信芳在此一年中，演過不知多少回，黃金更新的「京角，都貼過這齣戲，票友客串也都愛唱這齣戲，最近林樹森在大舞台登台，也有這齣戲，想不到這已成古董的「戰長沙」在廿八年度竟然大交好運。</p>
<p>（二）二進宮因爲「戰長沙」的走紅，無形中一切久無人演之舊劇，却都成了引人入勝的好戲，「戰長沙」外，「二進宮」也是本年度最吃香的一齣戲，不過這戲只有京朝派的角兒，在滬貼演，然而因爲言菊朋王玉蓉以及鄭冰如，貼這齣戲無不賣滿堂，所以也把牠列爲最紅的戲。</p>
<p>（三）文素臣這是本年度劇壇的奇蹟，也可以說是藝人周信芳，從事戲劇數十年來，最大的收穫。文素臣曾經連賣幾十塲滿堂，不知吸引了多少觀衆，真有「不看素臣不是上海人」之概，就是接二連三南來的京朝派名角，也都爭先往觀，「文素臣」可以算是今年圾紅的戲了。</p>
<p>除上述諸戲以外，一四郎探母」「玉堂春」這兩齣戲倚老賣老依然能配合上海人的胃口，至於神怪佈景戲，今年好像沒有去年那樣大的魔力，以致有漸趨淘汰之勢，預料廿九年度的海上劇壇，神怪戲必將絕跡，而舊劇反有復興的可能。</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>一世之雄</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>一世這雄」爲了，最近經過了剪裁，才准公映。說它暴露過甚，從現在銀幕上所看到的，而加以臆測，或許是在和軍警對壘的時候，還有誇大的描寫。至於內容上的暴露，正是劇作者針對着目前的畸形社會而發的。羅基被判十五年出獄，他欣然往見律師詹姆士時，他呑沒了羅基的存款十萬元。從這仇恨出發，羅基也把持了要挾的憑據，從而同流合污。這是整個社會問題，不是羅基的了友傑里所能挽回的。然而劇作者從傑里身上，提出一個流浪兒童的教育問題，這一點我以爲才是本片的焦點。</p>
<p>全片在寇蒂茲的雄闊的手法下，從開始到終塲，緊緊地刺激着觀衆的心弦，沒有片刻的鬆弛。第一段介紹幼時的羅基和傑里，也簡潔而明爽。羅基出獄，回到陋巷，和露莉相見，及任籃球比賽的評判員時，導演者又使這塲戲充滿了趣味。</p>
<p>詹姆士賈克奈的羅基，他的敏捷，隨便的舉止，確實是他所有作品中演得最好的一次。潘得奧勃林的傑里，在將鈔票退還羅基，及懇勸羅基兩塲劇，演來沉着感激。</p>
<p>六位小大亨均盡職。「晤」女郎安秀麗丹戲不多，但是她的正路戲却不壞。</p>
<h3>劇壇簡訊</h3>
<p>上海實騐劇團，是一個專門提拔新人，訓練新的生力軍的一個業餘劇團。他們經過了兩個月的努力，都已籌備就緒，定今日（卅一）及元旦兩日早塲假座辣斐花園劇塲舉行首次實習公演。劇目有「熊」，「出走」，及「流行症」等三個獨幕喜劇，讀者如持本報定單前往購票，可享九折優待。</p>
<p>藝型業餘劇社，茲定於元旦上午九時半假座新都劇塲演出，劇目爲（一）戀愛問題，（二）高樓上，（三）被摧殘的生命。</p>

<p>Linchuan Japanese troops in southern Anhui, mainly from the Hiroya Division, launched a counterattack against the Chinese. Chinese troops launched a full-scale attack on the night of the 26th, breaking through the lines at Sankou on the Guichi and Qingyang fronts, sinking two Japanese warships, routing a portion of the Japanese cavalry, and capturing 18 Japanese horses. (Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Jiujiang Separately Encircled</h3>
<p>Sihui On the morning of the 28th, a portion of the Japanese troops in Jiujiang attacked westward, while another portion harassed Guanshan. Chinese forces used clever tactics to encircle the Japanese troops separately. Fierce fighting continued until the evening, resulting in the annihilation of several hundred Japanese. The remaining Japanese troops made repeated attempts to break out, but all failed. They are currently being surrounded and annihilated. (Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Wounded from Lintang Transported to Nanchang</h3>
<p>Dongxiang Due to repeated encirclement and annihilation by Chinese troops in recent weeks, the Japanese troops in Nanchang have suffered over 2,000 casualties. About 1,000 wounded Japanese soldiers have been transported from Lintang to Nanchang City recently. The Japanese troops in Nanchang are currently in a state of extreme panic. (Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Mobilizes the People to Jointly Defend Their Land</h3>
<p>Shaoguan The Guangdong Party, government, and military authorities, in order to mobilize the people to jointly defend their land and organize a large number of young men and women to participate in wartime work, have established a Wartime Service Committee through consultations among various agencies.

<h3>Japanese Officer States that the Battle of Baotou Was Fierce; Chinese Troops Acted Nimbly, Approaching the City; Japanese Regimental Commander Colonel Kobayashi Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Beiping Lieutenant Colonel Tonowaki of the Japanese army flew here from Baotou yesterday. He told reporters about the battle of Baotou, saying that the battle was more intense than they had expected. The main force of General Fu Zuoyi's (former Chairman of Suiyuan Province) 35th Army, about 10,000 men, seemed to have advanced secretly, moving only at night, and arrived under the city of Baotou. About 100 men infiltrated the city one by one through the water gate. The Chinese army launched an attack after preparing thoroughly near Baotou. General Fu Zuoyi apparently believed that he could recapture the city, but the Japanese army, anticipating the Chinese attack, completely surrounded them and attacked their rear. Japanese reinforcements arrived by train from the east and forced the Chinese army to retreat westward. Tonowaki continued that the Chinese army suffered 3,000 to 3,500 casualties, while the Japanese army suffered 200 casualties. The actions of the Mongolian army were quite commendable. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Chinese Army War Trophies to Be Exhibited</p>
<p>Wuyuan The first batch of war trophies captured by the Chinese army in Baotou has been transported to Sui and is being exhibited. There are dozens of items, including mountain guns, light and heavy machine guns, and Japanese and puppet flags. A large number of people are viewing them. (Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Wuyuan In the recent Chinese army's recapture of Baotou, thousands of Japanese were killed or wounded. Japanese corpses are scattered around the suburbs of the city, making it almost impossible to count. The Chinese have been cleaning the battlefield for days and have discovered the bodies of many important Japanese officers, including Japanese Regimental Commander Kobayashi Kazuo. They could not be transported away. The chaotic and embarrassed state of their retreat can be imagined. It is reported that Kobayashi Kazuo graduated from the 27th class of the Japanese Military Academy and served as a cavalry company commander, cavalry school instructor, and cavalry inspector. He was a research expert in cavalry operations and was fully responsible for the command of Japanese cavalry in western Suiyuan. His death at the hands of the Chinese is a major blow to the Japanese.

<h3>Burmese Delegation Visits China, Touring Yunnan</h3>

<h3>Platoon Leader Xu Bravely Seizes Machine Guns</h3>
<p>Xingji During the battle of Caojiagou in Xixian County, Japanese troops launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army with intense artillery fire. A certain company of the Chinese army suffered heavy casualties. Four heavy machine guns could not be withdrawn. Xu Huaisheng, the second lieutenant platoon leader of the company, disregarding his own safety, personally used a machine gun to fire at the Japanese and took the opportunity to carry a heavy machine gun on his shoulder and transport it to the rear. Then he returned to the front line. When the Japanese army launched a second attack, the platoon leader continued to fire and again carried a machine gun to the rear. After four round trips, he finally transported all the machine guns back. He also carried back two heavy machine guns from other locations. All the officers and soldiers admired his bravery. When the company commander was killed in action, Platoon Leader Xu was promoted. Unfortunately, he died of illness not long after. An official praised Xu for his calm response and his ability to preserve weapons under intense Japanese artillery fire, calling him a model soldier and ordering the machine guns to be renamed Xu Huaisheng Heavy Machine Guns in his memory.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Constitutional Government Next Year</h3>
<p>Another year has passed quickly, and it is again time for "New Year's Eve." The history of the Chinese nation's struggle this year is filled with words interwoven with blood and tears, but also many inspiring and encouraging events. Militarily, there have been frequent victories; economically, there has been much construction, which is known to both Chinese and foreigners and does not need to be elaborated on. Even politically, there is a page worthy of special mention and emphasis. Although the general public has focused its attention on military developments and buried itself in the arduous wartime life, thus neglecting politics, its importance is recognized by knowledgeable people. This is the fact that the National Political Council's proposals to promulgate the Constitution early and convene the National Assembly on schedule have been adopted by the Central Government.</p>
<p>China's constitutional movement, of course, varies in content according to the times, but speaking from the beginning, it has a history of more than 30 years. Not to mention the distant past, just since the publication of the first draft of the Constitution in 1934, there have been many twists and turns before it finally came into view. The Central Government was just about to convene the National Assembly on November 12, 1937, when the Lugouqiao Incident suddenly broke out, and it was again suspended. At present, the War of Resistance is in full swing, and military reports are frequent. The sudden decision to implement constitutional government has caused those who are concerned about national affairs to question (1) whether the whole country, both government and people, can "take their time" to engage in the formulation of the fundamental law of the country? (2) Whether it is premature to implement constitutional government before the completion of political tutelage? (3) Whether the Constitution, even if it can be drafted, can be used freely? (4) Whether the implementation of constitutional government during the War of Resistance, when it is important to concentrate will, will inevitably lead to party strife, which will hinder the united front of the entire nation against the Japanese? These questions are, of course, reasonable and cannot be dismissed as unfounded worries. However, after carefully reading the explanation given by Speaker Jiang of the National Political Council in various newspapers last week, one can be greatly relieved. Speaker Jiang believes that (1) during the War of Resistance, we should work harder to build the country, and the passage of the two proposals on the implementation of constitutional government will lay a lasting and solid foundation for the country; (2) promoting constitutional government and implementing political tutelage not only do not hinder each other but are also mutually supportive; (3) precisely because the people cannot use the Constitution freely after it is drafted and promulgated, it is necessary to continue the unfinished work of political tutelage; (4) he believes that everyone will certainly not want to repeat the old habits of past parliaments and, therefore, must adopt a positive and well-intentioned attitude in criticizing the government's performance. Finally, he solemnly instructed: "The effectiveness of the implementation of constitutional government does not lie in the articles and form of the Constitution but in possessing the spirit of constitutionalism!" We recall that since the beginning of the War of Resistance two and a half years ago, many enthusiastic critics have often said that in this War of Resistance, our politics has always lagged behind the economy, especially behind the military. There is evidence for such criticism, especially for certain points in the central and local administration. However, we should not doubt the early implementation of constitutional government because of this. On the contrary, part of the meaning of early implementation of constitutional government lies in promoting politics so that politics can match the economy and the military. We firmly believe that the full-scale War of Resistance promoted national unity in the past, and now we will use the same strength and reason to promote national politics. Not only will it promote it, but it will also lay the spiritual foundation for harmony, public service, and national devotion. From these aspects, Speaker Jiang's statement that equal emphasis should be placed on resistance and nation-building, and that political tutelage and constitutional government should go hand in hand, is not only possible but also necessary. To explain the current early implementation of constitutional government in terms of the entire history of China's constitutional movement, it can be said to be a twist and turn that takes a sharp turn, and the water flows and the channel opens up! Implementing constitutional government and returning power to the people is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of "the world is for all," and it is also the destination of the revolution! The Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12 of next year to promulgate the Constitution and set a deadline of the end of June next year to complete the unfinished procedures for national elections. The former is only a little over 10 months away, and the latter is only 6 months away. Time is like a flowing river and is upon us. Although changes in dates and prospects, there are many precedents in history, and often because of the facts, it is necessary. However, this time during the War of Resistance, the great faith is involved, and the impact is extremely great, so there will certainly be no further delays. However, since the passage of the proposal by the National Political Council, the organization of the Constitutional Government Promotion Association and the holding of constitutional seminars in various places have been quite enthusiastic, which can be taken as clear evidence of efforts to promote and prepare calmly. At a time when the military situation has entered a major stage and the international situation is turbulent, the Chinese government is responding to both domestic and foreign affairs and has no time to rest. It must also complete the arduous project of implementing constitutional government in the next 10 months. We are willing to express our warm sympathy and, in particular, wish for complete success in advance.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Revises the Composition and Weight of Subsidiary Coins; Revises the Composition of One-Cent, Five-Cent, and Ten-Cent Subsidiary Coins; and Adds the Casting of Two-Cent Subsidiary Coins, Scheduled to Be Issued Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chongqing The Ministry of Finance has recently revised the composition and weight of one-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coins and added the casting of two-cent subsidiary coins, and has sent a circular telegram to the provincial and municipal governments, stating: "Subsidiary coins are a medium for small transactions, and there is a great need for them among the people. In recent years, the prices of the main raw materials for coinage have increased, and with the outbreak of the European War, the market prices of metals have increased even more, resulting in the actual value of subsidiary coins suddenly exceeding the legal value by a factor of one. The practice of hoarding and melting them for profit cannot be stopped, and they are even secretly transported to Japan to finance the enemy. In order to maintain the circulation of subsidiary coins and prevent traitors from illegally seeking profits, it is necessary to revise the regulations on subsidiary coins and adjust the composition and weight of various subsidiary coins to facilitate circulation. A plan to revise the composition and weight of one-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coins has been drafted, and a two-cent subsidiary coin has been added. The plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for resolution and to the Legislative Yuan for review and action. The revised regulations on subsidiary coins have been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, and the principle has already been decided. It is urgent to cast and issue them in advance to facilitate turnover. In addition to instructing the Central Mint to start casting immediately and setting the date for issue as January 1, 1940, and submitting it to the Executive Yuan for record and distribution, the revised articles 2, 3, and 5 of the regulations on subsidiary coins are enclosed for your information. Please instruct your subordinates to take note of this and make a public announcement." (Yucaiyin of the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing, telegram of the 30th)</p>
<h3>American Student Representative Broadcasts in Guiyang</h3>
<p>Guiyang Mr. Xiao Lizhi, an American student representative, gave a broadcast in English at the Guizhou Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 28th, entitled "My Impressions of Chinese Students and Free China." He first stated that in the past 13 weeks, he had traveled to various parts of southeastern and southwestern China and visited 15 universities and dozens of middle schools. He was greatly moved by the enthusiasm and love of the youth of the new China, their diligent work, their unity and mutual assistance, and their liveliness and courage. He then stated that he traveled through eight provinces from Hubei to Chongqing and deeply felt that China's human and material resources were extremely abundant and that production and construction had made considerable progress. New bridges, new roads, new schools, and new factories could be seen everywhere, and farmers were especially diligent. The new culture of the new China has laid a solid foundation in the process of the War of Resistance. He then praised the strength of the Chinese people's recovery and said that American students and people should urgently assist in the construction of the new China in order to establish a new world order.

<h3>The British Side Is Anxious to Solve the Tianjin Silver Problem; It Is Reported That British and Japanese Merchants Have a Solution; Cole Is Going to Chongqing to Negotiate on This Matter</h3>
<p>London The British government announced last night that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador to China, will leave Shanghai for Chongqing today to discuss with the Chinese authorities the solution of the British-Japanese Tianjin problem and the silver problem in the ports of North China. The British side generally believes that if the Tianjin silver problem can be solved, the Japanese side will lift the blockade of the British and French concessions. It is said that Mr. Butler, the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese ambassador, have already talked about the Tianjin silver problem on Wednesday. The Chinese side still refuses to agree to the British proposal to move the silver from the territory under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. According to news obtained by Americans here, the Anglo-Japanese agreement currently in progress will stipulate that 100,000 pounds be taken from the 800,000 pounds of silver stored in the Tianjin Bank of Communications warehouse to be used for disaster relief in North China. The use of this fund will be jointly managed by an Anglo-Japanese joint association, and the remaining funds will be deposited in a certain American bank in Tianjin, or that is, the Citibank of Tianjin. It is said that Tokyo has agreed to this plan, and the American side is now working hard to get the Chinese government to agree to this. The Anglo-Japanese agreement also includes cooperation between the British and Japanese sides in police affairs in Tianjin to maintain the tranquility of the market. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Recounts the Situation in Europe</h3>
<p>Chongqing Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, gave a speech at a joint meeting of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, the Chinese Branch of the International Peace Movement Association, and the Chinese People's Foreign Affairs Association on December 23. The original text of his speech was published today. The content described the negotiations among various countries before the European War, many of which have not yet been made public. Mr. Sun recounted the situation of Germany</p>
<p>Annexing Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>The development after that, Mr. Sun said, the Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, at that time, proposed to convene a conference of five countries, England, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Romania, to resolve the situation in Eastern Europe. British Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that the time was not yet ripe and suggested that the Soviet Union guarantee the independence of Poland and Romania to replace this conference.</p>
<p>Litvinov</p>
<p>He suggested that the three countries, England, France, and the Soviet Union, jointly guarantee the peace of Europe. When he arrived in Moscow, the negotiations between the three countries, England, France, and the Soviet Union, were beginning. This negotiation failed because England, based on Poland's attitude, rejected the conditions put forward by the Soviet Union that Soviet troops should enter Poland to give them effective guarantees against aggression.</p>
<p>Therefore, it failed.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union then raised the issue of the security guarantees of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. England insisted that the above-mentioned small countries should remain neutral, and at the same time, England further advocated that the Soviet Union should guarantee the security of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and the Soviet Union refused. The Soviet Union proposed that England and France send plenipotentiaries to Moscow for negotiations. Until the negotiations failed, the new Soviet Foreign Minister,</p>
<p>Molotov</p>
<p>He again proposed to start the staff talks between the three countries, and advocated that the two countries, England and France, should send Viscount Gort and General Gamelin to discuss various events with Voroshilov, the Soviet Defense Commissar. Unexpectedly, England and France sent other people to go there, and they did not bring proper credentials.</p>
<p>Arrive in Moscow</p>
<p>A week later, these credentials were sent by airmail. The Soviet Union was quite dissatisfied with the attitude of England and France, and concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany. Sun Ke recounted the Far East, saying that when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited Moscow, he did not discuss the Far East issue. As for his visit to the Soviet Union, it was in early April, when he was ordered by the government to take the northwest route to Moscow, and left Moscow in July, and went to France via Northern Europe, and returned to Moscow in mid-August, and left the Soviet Union in October, visited Italy, France, and England via the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and returned to China via Italy, Singapore, and Vietnam by plane on November 20.

<h3>Pig Bristle Exports</h3>
<p>Chongqing The Central Trust Bureau has been controlling the trade in pig bristles since July. According to news from the Hong Kong Office of the Bureau, China earned foreign exchange worth about 28 million yuan last year by exporting pig bristles. The United States is the main purchaser of Chinese pig bristles. In the first nine months of this year, no less than 10,590 piculs of pig bristles were exported from Hong Kong, worth 5.4 million Hong Kong dollars. Currently, Sichuan pig bristles rank first in both quality and quantity. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Reviews the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>London Today, the Manchester Guardian published an article reviewing the situation of the Sino-Japanese war, stressing the vastness of Chinese territory, the vast distances, and the lack of important locations, and said that the Japanese army may win many victories, but it is still unknown how to win the war. The Japanese can only effectively control the land where their troops are stationed. The unity of the Chinese has been able to resist all attacks. The large army under Commander-in-Chief Chiang has not been destroyed. The Japanese side has tried every means to inflict a blow on the Chinese army to make it decisively defeated, but so far it has not won any victory that can determine the outcome. Today, fierce battles have occurred in many locations along the 1,500-mile front line, which is sufficient to show the heavy burden borne by the aggressor, who must transport all the necessary supplies for combat from overseas, and still has no hope of ending the war after more than two years of fighting.

<h3>U.S. Groups Oppose Renewing Trade Treaty with Japan; Senator Smith Advocates Restricting Steel Exports</h3>
<p>Washington - As the U.S. Congress is set to convene next week, private organizations in the United States have resumed their campaigns against Japanese policies. While pro-Japanese groups have also voiced their opinions, they have failed to gain public sympathy. Other groups have remained silent. The most active group opposing Japanese policies is the Committee to Oppose Encouraging Japanese Aggression, led by Stimson as chairman. The committee recently issued promotional materials stating that "90% of Japan's imported scrap iron and scrap copper, 65% of its imported kerosene, and 90% of its imported copper are supplied by the United States." The document stated, "Since the United States declared the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan trade treaty, the legal obstacles to the United States stopping the supply of military goods to Japan have been removed. The United States can take action in mid-January next year, depending on whether Congress is deeply convinced that the people intend to stop the shipment of Japanese goods." The California Joint Immigration Committee, which has consistently opposed amending Japan's immigration laws, has suddenly become more active. The committee argues that if the United States enters into any agreements with Japan, it should not take advantage of any failures. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - Congressman Smith, a Democrat from Kansas, announced yesterday that he would introduce a bill in Congress to protect the domestic steel industry. If passed, this bill would greatly affect Japan's supply of military raw materials. Smith stated that he hopes Congress will pass a law similar to the Tin Export Control Act passed in 1936. The 1936 law prohibited the export of all tin bars except under presidential license. Although Smith's proposal does not specify which country it targets, Japan would undoubtedly be the country most affected, as U.S. scrap iron exports to Japan account for more than 50% of the total. Japan obtains approximately two million tons of scrap iron from the United States each year. (23rd United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Domestic Telegram Rates to Increase Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Domestic telegram rates in China will increase from New Year's Day as follows: for standard Chinese character telegrams, the rate will be 12 cents per character within the province and 18 cents per character outside the province. Urgent telegrams will be charged double. Military and official telegrams will be charged half price, while news telegrams will be charged one-quarter of the standard rate. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Transportation Company to Be Established in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A transportation company with a capital of 50 million yuan will be established in Chongqing on New Year's Day to centralize the management and operation of existing public transportation systems within Free China. The new company will be directed by Chen Yanjiong, the director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, and will initially focus on adjusting and centralizing transportation on the Sichuan-Guangxi highways. The Sichuan-Guangxi highways include all truck roads in the southwestern provinces of China. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Philippine Vice President Advocates for Independence</h3>
<p>Manila - Philippine Commonwealth Vice President Osmeña delivered a speech here yesterday during the Rizal Day celebrations, urging the Filipino people to continue striving for independence. He stated that independence is only one step away and that retreating now would be disloyal to history. However, he emphasized that the pursuit of independence should be through peaceful means. He acknowledged that unavoidable dangers will always exist and that the people cannot simply pass on their difficulties to future generations without a struggle. He argued that without confronting these challenges, the nation would become weak and incapable, unworthy of surviving through its own strength and courage. He also anticipated economic difficulties, noting that even abandoning independence would not necessarily eliminate such problems, as a nation's economic life, like an individual's, is subject to prosperity, recession, and panic. He concluded that Philippine security rests in its own hands and that if the purpose is just, they should move forward. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>150,000 Soviet Troops Reinforce, Preparing for Large-Scale Offensive; Use of Aircraft to Transport Troops Disrupts Finnish Rear Traffic; Finnish Suicide Squad Raids Murmansk Railway Line</h3>
<p>Copenhagen - According to news from Helsinki today, the Soviet Union is currently mobilizing 150,000 Red Army troops from Siberia and the Caucasus region and deploying them in the Karelia Isthmus to the Taipale sector to break through the Mannerheim Line. Furthermore, a large number of aircraft are being concentrated in the Leningrad area to coordinate with the new forces and launch a large-scale offensive against the Mannerheim Line. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Helsinki - 100,000 Soviet troops launched a fierce attack on the Mannerheim Line yesterday, continuously bombarding Finnish positions with heavy artillery throughout the day. The main Soviet force is advancing towards Viipuri, Finland's third-largest city, a major industrial area and shipping center. The Soviet offensive on the left flank of the Mannerheim Line has been ongoing for three weeks, and they have now changed their strategy, shifting the attack from Viipuri to the right flank. Soviet aircraft are transporting troops to the rear of Finnish lines at night, dropping them by parachute. These troops are dressed in Finnish uniforms and attempt to operate in the Finnish rear, destroying bridges and communication lines. The Soviet Union's application of this tactic is far more effective than that of other countries. I previously witnessed a demonstration in Moscow where 1,000 people landed simultaneously, and even small tanks were dropped using this method. The Finnish military is now paying close attention to this Soviet tactic. There are many lakes and swamps in Finland, but they are currently frozen. It is anticipated that once the weather warms and the ice melts, the Soviet Union will no longer be able to use this tactic. As far as I know, there are secret agents throughout the Finnish positions observing the actions of every citizen, and soldiers are guarding all important routes and bridges day and night. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Several Soviet warships have been bombarding the Finnish port of Viipuri in the Gulf of Finland for days with long-range artillery. However, the shelling has stopped in the past 24 hours. In addition, while Soviet army artillery units have been shelling Finnish military positions in the Karelian Isthmus, the Finnish fortifications are extremely strong and well camouflaged, so the shells have not hit their targets. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - News received here today from Stockholm reports that a Finnish unit has reached the Leningrad-Murmansk railway line. The railway has been destroyed, disrupting transportation and halting the supply of food to Soviet troops. There was once a mutiny in Murmansk, and the sound of artillery behind Soviet lines led to rumors of a Soviet mutiny. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters military correspondent reports that if it is proven true that Finnish suicide squads broke into Soviet lines and cut off Murmansk, the northern Soviet forces will be in danger of having their supplies cut off. The Soviet supply organization is not good, and even a temporary disruption of traffic on the important railway line will cause the Soviet army to collapse and the front to disintegrate. This fragile railway line winds from Leningrad through Kandalaksha to the Arctic Ocean, and at one point is only 40 miles from the Finnish border, making it very vulnerable to attack. If this point is breached, communication between the Soviet commander and the Red Army fighting on the central and northern fronts will be impossible to maintain. Finnish leaflets dropped on Soviet lines offering rewards to Soviet deserters have been successful, so mutinies are possible in the Soviet ranks, as the Soviet army currently appears demoralized. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Mutiny on the Finnish Northern Front; News Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>Oslo - According to a telegram received here from Kirkenes in northern Norway, the Soviet troops who invaded the northeastern corner of Finland are still in northern Norway. Rumors of a Russian mutiny have not yet been confirmed. (30th Reuter's East Agency)</p>
<p>London - Semi-official news from Helsinki reports that another mutiny has broken out in the Soviet lines in the Salla district of the northern front. Soviet military aircraft were forced to bomb and strafe the troops in that area. It is said that Soviet infantry units engaged in fierce fighting with each other, and the Finnish side could hear their cries during the carnage. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm - According to news from Salla, two Soviet regiments fought each other today, each mistaking the other for Finnish troops. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish War Report</h3>
<p>Moscow - According to a statement released by the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, "There were no major developments on the front on the 29th, but Soviet aircraft bombed Finnish areas with great success." (30th TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating, "Soviet troops launched another attack on our forces at the northern end of the Karelian Isthmus on the 28th of this month and were repelled. The enemy suffered heavy losses, with a total of five tanks destroyed." (3rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany and the Soviet Union Prepare to Issue Warnings to the Three Nordic Countries, Forcing Them to Cease Assistance to Finland, Otherwise, They Will Be Considered to Have Violated Neutrality</h3>
<p>The Hague - The German and Soviet governments are currently intensifying pressure on the Scandinavian countries in the hope of preventing them from assisting Finland. It is reported that the German government will also issue warnings to these countries in the near future, threatening them to refuse to join the plans formulated by Western European countries. However, the general public in Germany doubts whether this move will be effective. (29th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm - There is a general impression in Berlin that Germany and the Soviet Union have exchanged views on the conditions for controlling the advance to the north. The Stockholm Daily News states that we expect Germany and the Soviet Union to fully cooperate, and this statement is not far from the truth. The two sides have agreed that the Scandinavian countries cannot be a route for aid to Finland; otherwise, they will be considered to have abandoned their neutrality. In summary, the current environment is that the form of aid to Finland from the peninsula will be the standard by which Germany and the Soviet Union determine whether the peninsula countries have violated neutrality. It is expected that German and Soviet accusations of the peninsula countries violating neutrality will be forthcoming soon. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Devotes Himself to World Peace, Welcoming Leaders of All Religions to Join Forces, Congress to Reconvene Next Month and Deliver a Speech</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt stated today that he would welcome any religious leader willing to discuss efforts to bring about world peace at the White House. He hopes that religious leaders will come to meet with him to discuss any peace plans they may have in mind. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - Political figures here are now paying close attention to President Roosevelt's speech to be delivered to Congress on January 3, as the speech will be read by Roosevelt himself and will review the international situation. All members of both houses of Congress will be present, and Roosevelt will announce the U.S. government's budget for 1940 for the first time in his speech. Therefore, the Washington political circles are expressing keen anticipation and attention to the declaration. (30th Reuter's East Agency)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Mussolini Visiting the Pope, Italian Official Statement Denies It</h3>
<p>Rome - Reuter's East Agency reporters have learned from well-informed sources that the rumors of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini visiting the Vatican have been officially denied. Although Italian newspapers reported that the Pope, in his capacity as "Head of State," reciprocated the visit of King Victor Emmanuel III, he was not received with full diplomatic honors. When Pius XII entered the palace, only Foreign Minister Ciano, the Italian ambassador to the Vatican, Alieri, and senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assisted in the reception. Prime Minister Mussolini was not present. The Pope's visit to the King was meant to show the harmonious relationship between Italy and the Vatican. The absence of the Prime Minister at the event has led to speculation that the Prime Minister will visit the Vatican in his capacity as Fascist Leader to reaffirm the harmonious relationship between Italy and the Vatican. However, well-informed sources have confirmed that this is not true, and there is no such rumor from the Vatican either. (30th Reuter's East Agency)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Activity Between Rome and Berlin Related to Mediating Peace, German Ambassador to Italy Returns Home for Consultation</h3>
<p>Copenhagen - A political correspondent for a newspaper in Berlin reports that diplomatic activity between Berlin and Rome has been quite active recently, which is related to the Pope's speech before Christmas, which condemned violent policies and listed various major principles for establishing a just peace. From Berlin's perspective, the Pope and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are trying their best to prevent the current war from expanding, and to prevent Bolshevism from continuing to expand its power. On the one hand, the Soviet Union has encountered fierce resistance from Finland, and on the other hand, it intends to demand naval bases on the Black Sea coast from Romania, which may be forced to negotiate with it. It can be seen that the crisis posed by Bolshevism is very real. In addition, Archbishop Orsenigo, the Vatican ambassador to Germany, has continued to make contact with the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently, as many as six times in a week. Observers in Berlin believe that this matter should be compared with the mutual visits between the Italian King and the Pope, and it is expected that Archbishop Orsenigo may not have made any practical peace proposals to the German government, but rather exchanged opinions to find a basis for mediating peace if necessary. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome - The German ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, returned home this afternoon for consultation. (29th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of German Army Complete Training Next Spring, Can Be Formed into 240 Divisions, Anticipated Offensive on the Western Front</h3>
<p>London - A correspondent for the "News Chronicle" in Amsterdam reports that, according to reliable sources from neutral countries in Berlin, Germany hopes to have 5 million trained or partially trained people enlisted by next spring. According to the current organization, the above number can be formed into about 240 divisions. It is heard that after the training camps, instructors, and weapons are all prepared, they plan to continue to recruit 1 to 2 million people. Neutral observers in Berlin believe that the German side may not be able to provide sufficient equipment for this second batch of recruits. The age of most of these soldiers is close to middle age. However, there is good reason to believe that the lightest and medium-sized weapons and tanks needed for the above 240 divisions can be fully equipped after the military training is completed. Fifty of these divisions will need to be used to defend the German border and maintain order in the conquered areas, with 40 divisions needed in Poland alone. When these 240 divisions are trained, the number of German troops will almost double, because when the war broke out, the total number of German troops was about 2.9 million. Neutral observers further predict that Hitler intends to launch a huge land offensive in the spring. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Warship Hit by Torpedo, Only Suffered Minor Damage</h3>
<p>London - An official announcement stated that the British warship attacked by a German submarine with a torpedo on Thursday afternoon has now sailed to a port on its own and has not suffered heavy damage. However, in addition to the one missing person who has been reported as likely dead and the one seriously injured, it is believed that the missing person must have died, so the loss suffered by the ship's crew is a total of four missing and one seriously injured. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London - The Admiralty recently announced that one of our "Queen Elizabeth" class battleships was attacked yesterday by a torpedo fired by an enemy submarine, but the damage was very minor and it was still able to proceed as normal. It is reported that in addition to the "Elizabeth," there are also the "Valiant," "Warspite," "Barham," and "Malaya," which were built between 1912 and 1915 and were renovated separately before 1933. Each of these ships has a displacement of 31,000 tons and is equipped with eight 14-inch guns, eight 6- to 12-inch guns, and even twelve guns. Since the outbreak of the war, two British warships have been sunk by the Germans: the battleship "Royal Oak" and the aircraft carrier "Courageous." They still have fourteen battleships, three of which are being renovated. In addition, there are nine more that have already begun construction or are being prepared, two of which can be completed within the coming year. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters naval correspondent said that the fact that a British warship was hit by a torpedo but suffered only minor damage has aroused much speculation. In the last war, large warships were often equipped with steel wire torpedo nets, but they were abandoned because they were ineffective in wartime and were replaced with ship protectors. This is placed on the side of the ship, so that the torpedo can only explode outside the actual hull, and the extent of the damage is only to reduce the speed of the warship by one nautical mile. This is obviously an important means of defense against torpedoes and avoids damage to important parts of the warship. Since the last European war, this ship protector has made great progress. All warships equipped with this can resist repeated attacks by torpedoes. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Military Position Greatly Strengthened</h3>
<p>Paris - According to observers here, France's position at the end of 1939 is far stronger than it was a year ago. From a military point of view, the situation has improved greatly in the past four months. The Maginot Line is no longer just a defensive line, but has become a great fortress line. In front of the original fortress line are now densely packed field fortresses, barbed wire, concrete bunkers, tank traps, and artillery positions. Currently, about one million people are employed in factories manufacturing the latest weapons, especially the most advanced weapons for aerial combat. In the shipyards, they are currently engaged in the construction of three 35,000-ton battleships. As for gold reserves and foreign exchange, they have also increased significantly compared to the start of the war due to a greater recovery of funds. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Second Meeting Between Soviet and Japanese Officials Discusses Trade Issues, Both Sides Exchange Lists of Products for Rotation</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to reliable sources, the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, met with the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, Mikoyan, yesterday and exchanged lists of goods that both sides could export when the Soviet Union and Japan establish trade in the future. This is a solid step forward in the path of establishing trade between the two countries. In addition, regarding the fishery issue, Ambassador Togo has already received new instructions issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the two sides can establish an agreement in a short period of time. The Soviet government requested Japan on the 27th of this month to pay off the final installment of the China Eastern Railway as a prerequisite for negotiating a fishery agreement. It is heard that the Japanese side is prepared to give a satisfactory reply. If so, then this long-pending issue of the China Eastern Railway can also be resolved incidentally. The current fishery agreement will expire on the evening of the 31st of this month. Therefore, Ambassador Togo may meet with the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov today, and at least demand that the Soviet government establish a "temporary measure" with Japan. However, even if the two countries enter into a state of non-agreement, the relationship between the two sides has greatly improved recently, so a formal agreement should not be difficult to sign within a few weeks, that is, before the start of the fishing season next spring. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow - Ambassador Togo met with the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, Mikoyan, at 6 p.m. on the 29th for the second meeting to discuss specific matters regarding the issue of trade between Japan and the Soviet Union. (29th Nichi Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Newspapers reported that the Japanese authorities urgently issued instructions to the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, to propose new conditions to the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, so that at least a temporary fishery agreement could be concluded before the expiration of the current fishery agreement at the end of the year. The Asahi Shimbun said that there is little possibility that these negotiations will be completed this year, but the current Soviet-Japanese relationship is much more satisfactory than at the end of last year, and it is expected that the temporary state of non-agreement will cause little damage. It is heard that the Soviet Trade Commissioner Mikoyan exchanged a list of commodities that the Soviet Union and Japan hope to export to each other with Togo yesterday to prepare for the proposed trade negotiations.

<h3>Since the Outbreak of the European War, British Air Force Achievements: Escorting Merchant Ships Repeatedly Proves Successful, 58 German Aircraft Destroyed</h3>
<p>London – Today, reliable sources have released figures indicating the achievements of the British Air Force in the four months since the outbreak of the war. According to these figures, as of Christmas Day, the British Coastal Air Force has flown 3.75 million miles in 44,000 flight hours. The distance flown each day is greater than the Earth's circumference. The British Air Force has spotted German submarines 107 times and attacked them 57 times. The British Air Force has provided 400 escort missions for group transport ships. Bomber squadrons have flown in formation over German skies 27 times. A total of 90 German aircraft attempting to fly over the British coast or operate in British territorial waters, 23 of which were destroyed by British aircraft, and 3 shot down by British anti-aircraft guns. Since the outbreak of the war, the British have destroyed a total of 58 German aircraft, 51 of which were the result of aerial combat between British aircraft and the enemy. Of the remaining seven, all but one were destroyed by anti-aircraft guns. From the Arctic Circle to the Bay of Biscay in Spain, the Coastal Air Force is responsible for escorting merchant convoys and patrolling around the British Isles to defend against submarines. The significant achievements of the Coastal Air Force also include locating the American ship "Flint City" after 27 hours of flight and rescuing the entire crew of the merchant ship "Campsie." In the first night after the outbreak of the war, British bomber squadrons flew over the industrial areas of northern Germany, dropping 4.25 million leaflets. Since then, they have repeatedly flown to major cities such as Berlin and Potsdam, dropping tens of millions of leaflets without encountering significant enemy resistance. The distribution of these leaflets is of great value, as it shows the German people the truth. The Germans have not yet launched large-scale aerial offensives, so the British fighter squadrons responsible for defending Britain have not had as many achievements as the Coastal Air Force and bomber squadrons. However, small-scale German air raids have all been defeated by British fighter aircraft, so they are in high spirits and eager to try. Before the outbreak of hostilities, the air force staffs of Britain and France held frequent meetings to determine the steps for cooperation between the two countries' air forces. Therefore, within a few days of the outbreak of the war, British bomber squadrons and fighter squadrons were established in French territory. The cooperation between British fighter aircraft and French aircraft has made it difficult for German aircraft to take films over the Maginot Line. British fighter aircraft are also very effective in protecting French ports, so the transportation of the British Expeditionary Force was completed safely and without any enemy interference.

<h3>A Review of the Far Eastern War Situation in One Year: Japan's Strategy Gradually Turns to Passivity</h3>
<p>—Observations from the Manila Daily Bulletin—</p>
<p>Manila – The Manila Daily Bulletin today reviewed the events of the past year in the Far East, acknowledging that "China's resistance has not slackened at all during this year. Not only that, but in fact, the Chinese have developed a sense of self-confidence no different from that of soldiers. In other words, they are willing to unanimously support the resistance until Japan's national power is exhausted. The biggest event of 1939, in the eyes of both China and Japan, is that Japan's war against China has gradually shifted from a strategy of conquering China to a strategy of coping with Chinese resistance. However, in terms of trade, it has been beneficial to Japan. Although Japan's expenditures are still huge and its revenues are still low, its monthly deficit is not as large as in 1938. The reason for this is that Japan's aggressive ambitions are not as strong as in the past, and the power of trade has begun to recover, but the benefits are still negligible, only slightly better than the losses of a year ago."

<h3>Southern Ireland Will Use Harsh Measures Against Rioters, Temporary Parliament Convened on January 3rd, Firearms Stolen in Dublin Recovered</h3>
<p>Dublin – The Southern Irish government will convene a temporary parliament next Wednesday, the 3rd, to give the government greater power to deal with the activities of the Irish Republican Army. It is expected that legislation will be introduced at the meeting to allow the authorities to detain prisoners for long periods without trial. Detention centers will be established in various places. About one-third, or six tons, of the ammunition stolen by the Republicans from the Phoenix Park arsenal some days ago has been recovered. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>London – After the theft of the Phoenix Park armory in Dublin, intensive searches by the military and police resulted in the recovery of one-third of the stolen ammunition. The Southern Irish House of Representatives has scheduled a temporary meeting for January 3rd to pass legislation granting full powers to the Executive Yuan to strictly suppress rebellious activities. According to informed political sources, this bill will likely stipulate that the Executive Yuan may at any time indefinitely detain suspected terrorists or suspicious individuals without going through legal proceedings. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>London – The House of Representatives of the Republic of Ireland is scheduled to convene a temporary meeting on January 3rd of the coming year to discuss the necessary measures to prevent various rebellious activities. According to political sources, the House of Representatives may authorize the government to establish detention camps to detain terrorists and may detain them indefinitely before handing them over to the courts for legal punishment. In addition, one-third of a batch of firearms stolen from the Phoenix Park armory in Dublin has been recovered. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>London – After a group of rioters stole a batch of military equipment and ammunition from Phoenix Park in Dublin, Southern Ireland, on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, military and police authorities immediately conducted a major search around the city. It is now known that 80,000 rounds of ammunition have been recovered this morning (the stolen ammunition totaled one million rounds), but the city is still surrounded by military and police, fearing that these rioters may secretly transport some of the military equipment and ammunition to Northern Ireland. In addition, it is widely rumored that the House of Representatives of the Republic will convene a temporary meeting to formulate various special bills to cope with the situation. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Dublin – Major searches by military and police are still underway in Dublin and surrounding areas. It is now believed that the total amount of military equipment stolen by the Republicans from a military depot on Sunday is no less than 28 tons, totaling 1.25 million rounds of ammunition, packed in 700 boxes. Only 85 boxes have been recovered to date. It is estimated that at least 13 trucks were used to transport the stolen military equipment at the time. The authorities are currently conducting a very thorough search. Because the boxes containing this ammunition are waterproof, it is feared that the thieves have thrown them into the water, so they are currently searching the rivers around Dublin. Despite days of exhaustive searching, no further discoveries have been made. Although a reward of 1,000 pounds has been offered for information, no one has responded. When the Senate and House of Representatives hold a special meeting next week, they will pass legislation to cope with the overall situation, strengthen criminal law, and give the government full power to deal with suspects. Prisons and military police are now preparing for a major arrest of suspects. Last night, police searched a secret radio station and arrested four people in a room. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Quiet on the Western Front</h3>
<p>Paris – This city's communiqué today stated, "Aerial activity has resumed on the Western Front. There have been minor skirmishes with French forward units.

According to the budget passed by the House of Representatives some days ago, revenues and expenditures were estimated to be short by 15,000,000 francs. The Senate then made the above adjustments and sent it back to the House of Representatives for reconsideration. The House of Representatives has now approved it, thereby confirming its establishment. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>Turkish Government Handling Earthquake Relief, Earthquake Force Strong, Difficult to Recover for a While, Disaster No Less Than the Great Earthquake in Japan</h3>
<p>Istanbul – According to current estimates, the number of dead and injured in the Turkish earthquake is at least 30,000. The area most severely affected covers 60,000 square miles, resembling a vast open-air hospital and cemetery. The director of the Istanbul Observatory has warned that there may be another earthquake within the next ten days or longer and stated that the severity of this earthquake indicates geological phenomena 16 miles deep, so it will take a long time to stabilize. The exact situation of this catastrophe cannot yet be estimated because railway tracks are twisted, bridges are collapsed, power lines are cut, and severe wind and snow have made roads icy, hindering reports of deaths and injuries and preventing rescue teams from reaching the disaster areas in urgent need of rescue. The entire Turkish nation is deeply saddened by the news of tens of thousands of deaths and injuries. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Ankara – According to an official gazette issued by the Turkish government last night, the recent earthquake in Anatolia resulted in more than 20,000 deaths. The most severely affected area was near the city of Erzincan, which suffered a major earthquake in 1784 that completely destroyed it. This tragedy has now been repeated, with 70 percent of the city's population killed. Other severely affected areas include Sivas (population 70,000), Amasya (population 70,000), Kangal (population 20,000), and Pulumur (population 15,000). Tens of thousands of people in the disaster area, after the earthquake and fires, are mostly without clothing and food, crying for help. In addition, trains have been destroyed, and transportation has been cut off. Countless people are dying of famine rather than the earthquake. The Turkish government has now appointed General Orbay as the chairman of the relief committee to actively handle relief efforts. (Haitong, 30th)</p>
<p>Ankara – Local geological experts here claim that this earthquake in Anatolia, Turkey, is the largest earthquake in the world since the great earthquake in Japan in 1923. The result of the 1923 Japanese earthquake was the loss of 200,000 lives. The number already confirmed in this case is over 20,000. The exact number will be known only after the official investigation committee has investigated the matter. (Haitong, 30th)</p>
<p>Ankara – Due to the continuous efforts of the government, transportation with the various disaster areas affected by the recent earthquake has been restored. The various disaster areas are calling for urgent relief. It is said that the current climate is extremely cold, with wind and snow, and many victims are homeless, sleeping outdoors, a truly pitiful sight. A large number of people across the country are voluntarily joining the rescue work and donating money for relief. The Balkan countries have expressed deep sympathy for this major earthquake disaster. The Romanian government has ordered the transportation of building materials worth £10,000 to the disaster area to rebuild destroyed houses. The Bulgarian government has also ordered the transportation of goods and building materials worth £5,000 to Turkey. The King of Greece sent a telegram to the Turkish President in a personal capacity to express his condolences. The Greek Red Cross has telegraphed to the Turkish side, intending to send a fully equipped rescue team to Turkey. At the same time, the Greek government has instructed its ambassador to Turkey to pay 10,000 Turkish lire as the first batch of relief funds. In Athens, Major General Williamson, commander of the British garrison in Egypt, is cooperating with Prince Ali, chairman of the Turkish Earthquake Relief Committee, to transport 20 large army tents to Anatolia and donate £100 of relief funds in the name of the British army.

<h3>The Living Conditions of the Yi People in the Sichuan-Xikang Border Region: United in the Deep Mountains, Estimated to Number Over Five Million</h3>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Ke Xiangfeng, Dean of Academic Affairs and Head of the Sociology Department at Jinling University, went to various counties in southwestern Sichuan to investigate the actual social life of the Yi people in the Greater Liang Mountains. His travels took him to places like Meishan, Emei, Longchi, Shaping, Ebian, and Mabian, collecting a wealth of materials and specimens. According to Ke's account, the actual living conditions of the Yi people in the southwestern border region of Sichuan Province are as follows:</p>
<p>The Yi people, commonly known as the "Yi tribes," are scattered in the southwestern Sichuan provinces of Leibo, Ebian, Pingshan, Qianwei, and Xikang's Xichang, Yuexi, Zhaojue, Yanyuan, Huili, Dechang, and Mianning counties. Due to their backward culture and lack of communication with the outside world, the exact number scattered is about 5 million. According to local estimates, there are at least one million Yi people in the Sichuan-Xikang area. The Yi people can be further divided into two types: the Black Yi, who have the lowest level of culture, and the White Yi, who are mostly uncivilized Han Chinese with a slightly higher culture than the Black Yi.</p>
<p>The Black Yi's food supply is limited. Because the area they inhabit is mostly high mountains and valleys, they can only grow corn, which is not suitable for growing rice and wheat. Therefore, corn is their main food source. Some grow buckwheat, but the quantity is very small. Rice cultivation is rare. Secondary foods include potatoes, beans, and vegetables. Meat is mainly pork and mutton, with beef, chicken, and wild game as supplements. They eat two meals a day, breakfast around eight or nine in the morning, and dinner in the evening. Because they do not yet use oil lamps, there is no light in the dark night, so they go to bed immediately after dinner, which has become a habit. In terms of clothing, they mainly use woolen fabrics. Men often use white wool shawls to wrap their entire bodies, regardless of the cold or warmth. The shawls come in white, blue, and red colors. Women do not wear trousers, only skirts. The upper garment is fastened on the left, retaining an ancient style. It is also made of wool and is not changed with the seasons, making it difficult to bear the smell of wool. Living conditions are also very simple. They use earth for walls and tree bark for tiles, barely sheltering them from wind and rain. Some use bamboo curtains for walls. Sleeping on the ground has become a habit.</p>
<p>The tribe's marriage customs are very strange. The marriage process begins with an introduction by a matchmaker. Naturally, bamboo doors are matched with bamboo doors, and wooden doors with wooden doors. After permission from both sets of parents, the engagement takes place. Engagement gifts are mainly livestock. The wealthier have more livestock, while the poorer give only a few pigs and sheep. On the eve of the wedding, relatives from both families gather. The groom's family sends a representative to the bride's home to carry the bride back. When this representative arrives at the bride's home, the whole family holds basins and bowls full of cold water and throws them at him. Although the representative becomes a soaked chicken, he is not allowed to enter the door. Finally, the people throwing water smear his face with ash, turning him into a "painted-face general" before he is allowed to enter. That night, the bride's guests drink heavily and eat bean dregs voraciously. After drinking, they sing and dance wildly. When they sing sad songs of separation, they cry loudly when they feel sad. The representative then carries the bride away at dawn. The groom's family also has a banquet and celebration that night. However, the bride returns to her family with the groom that day. After two or three years, the bride returns to the groom's home and begins their cohabitation life. It is not incorrect to call the groom her nominal husband.</p>
<p>They do not have a formal organization and seem to be a kind of clan system. The clan chief is called the "Black Bone," who has the power to control the entire clan, like an ancient chieftain. They also have their own writing, which is similar in shape to Tibetan writing, but the pronunciation is very different. When the clan chief issues orders, he writes the entire text on a wooden board and distributes it to each household. They also have regular markets where they trade with each other, often exchanging cowhide, sheepskin, medicinal herbs, livestock, wild animals, and honey for salt and cloth from the Han Chinese area. Salt is their prized food and is only served to honored guests. They have silversmiths, coppersmiths, and blacksmiths who can make crude metal ornaments. They have no schools, and their intelligence is undeveloped. They lack national and ethnic consciousness, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Although they are in an uncivilized era and isolated from intermarriage with the outside world, making it difficult to influence them, they are physically strong, fiercely tempered, and possess a strong sense of solidarity. When they fight with other tribes, even if there are new grievances and old grudges, they eliminate their prejudices and unite against outsiders. Therefore, the Yi people have been able to exist until now, and their population continues to grow. If they can be trained, instilled with patriotic knowledge, and organized into an army, they could become a strong force in the fight against the enemy.</p>
<h3>Newly Arrived Japanese Troops in Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Plan to Station in Southeastern Villages</p>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The Japanese troops originally stationed in Qiaoji, Lujiabao, Beiguo Changshou, and Qingyang and Nanzha along the Wuxi-Jiangyin line, belonging to the county, numbered twenty or thirty, or fifty or sixty, and were mixed with puppet troops. Now, the Japanese and puppet forces claim that the Jiangyin puppet county government requires more than 10,000 yuan per month in expenses, but there is no income. They want to levy land tax, but in reality, it is impossible. A few days ago, the Japanese suddenly brought six or seven hundred new troops from Taiwan, claiming to the outside world that a division would arrive and be stationed in schools and the Tianhou Temple and Huangni Nunnery outside the city. Their purpose is to station troops in the southeastern villages and forcibly levy land tax. Yunting had no Japanese troops. Dozens were also sent there the day before yesterday. The Chinese guerrillas, upon hearing the news, were prepared. If the Japanese troops arrive in the southeastern villages, they will launch a large-scale attack.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Yitong Army Reorganized into Water Police</h3>
<p>Jiang Shuwei Appointed Captain</p>
<p>Yuyao Correspondence: Jiang Shuwei, the commander of the Jiaxing People's Volunteer Army, repeatedly annihilated Japanese troops in Hejiao and Haiyan, achieving repeated successes. He was subsequently accused to the Provincial Governor by a certain officer stationed in Hejiao. The military authorities of Zhejiang Province, based on the report, and to clarify the actual situation, ordered the unit to be transferred to the province for training. After Jiang received the order, he led all the officers and soldiers across the Qiantang River to Xxx, a place in this county, to carry out training. The Zhejiang authorities also sent people to investigate Jiang's actions to see if they matched the allegations. After six months, the results showed that the allegations were completely unfounded. Therefore, in addition to issuing a commendation, the Zhejiang Provincial authorities formally reorganized Jiang's unit into a water police brigade and appointed Jiang as the captain. Jiang immediately instructed his subordinates to obey and drew up various water area pacification work and methods for protecting aquatic products, which will be submitted to the authorities for approval and implementation.</p>

<h3>Educational Personnel Appointed Township and Village Chiefs, Teachers' Colleges Temporarily Allowed to Accept Students with Equivalent Qualifications</h3>
<p>(Chengdu Aviation News) The Sichuan Provincial Government, in order to implement the new county system, which requires educational personnel to serve as township and village chiefs, issued an order to all city and county governments and teachers' colleges to make appropriate changes when recruiting new students next year to cultivate grassroots cadres for the new county system. The original order is as follows: The Department of Education reported that in order to implement the new county system in the province in the 29th year of the Republic, educational personnel must serve as township and village chiefs. In order to cultivate these key education personnel, we have telegraphed the Ministry of Education to temporarily allow teachers' colleges to accept 15% of students with equivalent qualifications and raise the age of admission to 25. The Ministry of Education telegraphed back that the method of teachers' colleges recruiting students with equivalent qualifications should be approved, and those over 18 years of age with one year of experience as elementary school teachers may be recruited. In order to cultivate key education personnel for the new county system in the province, a one-year short-term normal school course should be widely recruited to meet the needs. The above should be obeyed and reported accordingly. This order is issued for notification and compliance.</p>
<h3>New and Old Directors of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Scheduled to Take Office on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>(Xinghua Correspondence) The Central Government approved the resignation of Han Deqin, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, and appointed Ma Yuanfang, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, to succeed him. Jin Zonghua was appointed by the Executive Yuan to fill the vacancy left by the Director of the Department of Education. However, due to various reasons, Jin was slow to take over. All departmental affairs are still being reluctantly managed by Ma. After repeated urging, Jin finally decided to take over on New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic. Ma, who had repeatedly resigned from the Party Headquarters, had not been approved by the Central Government, so he will also take over the Provincial Party Headquarters in Xinghua on New Year's Day. Ma and Jin are currently planning all the work for the 29th year in Xinghua.</p>

<h3>Christmas Charity Football: Income of 13,000</h3>

Qingyun A is a rising force after the war, having won the first New Six Cup, the Hwa Lien Cup, and the Mainland Cup, among other championships, boasting strong players such as Yao Guanfan, Lu Hanjun, and Zhang Ying. The authorities took the match seriously, inviting Chen Linsheng, Ding Du, Ma Tingliang, and others to serve as referees. Each group had tense performances, earning much applause from the audience. Among them, the match between Lu Hanjun and Wang Huizhang was particularly exciting. Postal A suffered a loss of morale due to the absence of their main player Zhu Caisheng. In addition to Ye Xiuzhang and Wang Huizhang each scoring one point, the rest were defeated miserably. The final result was 13-1, with Qingyun A achieving a great victory.</p>

<h3>Western Football Group A Match: East China Faces West Police This Morning at 10:30 AM at Yiyuan Park; Talent Panic in East China</h3>
<p>Today, on New Year's Eve, there are seven Western Football matches scheduled. In Group A, East China will face West Police at 10:30 AM at Yiyuan Park, with Zhang Yue as the referee. East China has recently had bad luck, suffering repeated defeats. Guest player Luo Douwen has already left Shanghai, and main player Dai Jing is suffering from illness. Cai Shengsen has been suspended. Furthermore, today coincides with the bank's year-end closing, and Zhuang Jia will not be able to attend. Therefore, the arrangement of the lineup is truly a lament of lacking talent. Half of the eleven players are from the reserve team. However, this is giving newcomers a good opportunity. If they fight with all their might, there may be hope of defeating the enemy. In Group C, Hwa team will face Tung Wen; Hwa's lineup is strong, and it will surely inflict a painful defeat on Tung Wen. The order for today is as follows: West Police - East China Association (A) 10:30 AM Yiyuan Park North; West Children - Larks (A) 3:00 PM Racecourse; West Fords - East China (Reserve) 3:00 PM Jiaozhou Park; Youyou - Tung Wen (C) 3:15 PM Jiaozhou Park.</p>

<h3>Finance: Chinese Merchants Shorting Near, Holding Distant; Foreign Exchange Swap Slightly Tightens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. In the informal market for British and American exchange, due to Saturday being a half-day trading day, and the upcoming three-day New Year's holiday, including today, Sunday, there was a total of four days off. Moreover, overseas markets in Britain, America, Hong Kong, and other places are also closed today and tomorrow. Therefore, the spot market on the day was very quiet, with mediocre trading. The trend continued to be slightly tight and soft. However, the futures potential was affected by swaps, fluctuating wildly. Initially, due to the Chinese banks posting swaps, from US$2.1875 to 2.25, the monthly interest rate was 2.89% for the former and 3.33% for the latter. Later, wealthy Chinese merchants, seeing the high interest rates, came to short near and hold distant, posting bids. Furthermore, Hong Kong Electric, due to its short positions for this month, also posted bids, reversing the small step up. By the close, the British gold was only 0.03125, and the US exchange was only 0.09375, with the monthly interest rate being 1%. In half a day, the opening was even, followed by a slight bid by Hong Kong Electric, but without impact. Subsequently, Chinese merchants slightly shortened the distant months, and there were also some scattered settlements. In addition, Advantageous and Jardine also bought in, gradually tightening the market. At that time, the British gold was 4/65625, and the US exchange was 7.625 yuan. Afterwards, both buyers and sellers hesitated, and the situation stagnated before closing, with the British gold still at 4/65625, and the US exchange at 7.65625 yuan. As a result, it was slightly tighter by 0.03125 than the previous day. The futures market moved in the opposite direction to the spot market, resulting in the British gold actually loosening by 0.0625, and the US exchange also hardening by 0.09375.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Short Accounts Also Posting In</p>
<p>Early morning, London large bars saw near and distant terms shrink by 1.875. New York silver prices remained even, and London raw gold was stable. Exchange rates were even for British to American and British to French, and down 0.0625 for British to Shanghai. American to British increased by 0.025, to French increased largely by 0.075, and to Shanghai decreased slightly by 0.005. Central listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 4/6875 for British gold and 7.6875 yuan for US exchange, with no changes from the previous close. After opening, Hong Kong Electric released slightly, but it had little impact on the market. However, swap trading was thriving. Chinese banks successively posted US$1.2875 and 2.25, with monthly interest rates (excluding commissions) of 2.89% and 3.33%, mostly posted in by foreign firms such as Jardine and Advantageous. When HSBC's listing was announced unchanged, the silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 0.0125. Afterwards, due to foreign firms slightly settling accounts, and Chinese merchants also buying distant month US exchange, along with Advantageous and Jardine slightly buying in, the situation slightly tightened and softened. At that time, it shrank to 4/65625 and 7.625 yuan. At this time, short accounts from Hong Kong suddenly posted in, and wealthy Chinese merchants also posted in, with those posting out having disappeared. The swap therefore tightened. Among them, Hong Kong Electric would post in for US$1.25, with a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of 1.62%. At noon, the spot situation was slightly even. Until the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was quoted at 4/65625 for British gold and 7.65625 yuan for US exchange. Next month's futures were 4/625 for British gold and 7.5625 yuan for US exchange. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British and US exchange softened by 0.03125 each, and January futures British gold loosened by 0.0625, while US exchange hardened by 0.09375. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British Tight, American Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 30th (telegram). The exchange market opened steadily this morning, with no change in British or American exchange. The Shanghai exchange spot rate fell by one yuan (yesterday's close was 317 yuan), to 316 yuan. The Japanese exchange spot rate loosened by 0.025, to 104.25 yuan. At 10:30, there was a softening appearance. The British exchange spot rate shrank by 0.03125, to 1 shilling 2 pence 9375. The distant term remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange spot rate rose by three yuan, to 319 yuan. The Japanese exchange spot rate returned to tighten by 0.025, still at 104 yuan. At 11:30, it was even. Finally, the British exchange spot rate remained unchanged, and the distant term tightened by 0.03125, to 1 shilling 2 pence 90625. The Shanghai exchange spot rate fell back down by one yuan, to 318 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rates Continue to Tighten</p>
<p>Tianjin, 30th (telegram). The exchange market opened firm this morning, with the market slightly tighter and softer than yesterday's opening. British and American exchange spot rates shrank by 0.125 each, with the British exchange at 4/5625, and the US exchange at 7.5 yuan. The Shanghai exchange remained unchanged, still opening at 103 yuan. The Lian banknote informal market was cheapened by one yuan, to 94 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of British and American gold pounds was not active, and it was the end of the year, so closures were pending, and the market price remained firm without change. British and American gold notes were in considerable demand, and the market situation was quite good. British gold notes rose to 47 yuan, and American gold notes rose to 13.13 yuan. The market situation continued to be good in the afternoon. In the evening market, American gold notes rose to 13.16 yuan. The demand for Hong Kong notes was also brisk, and the market price was firm and high. Canadian notes followed the rise of American notes, closely stepping up. The demand for Japanese gold notes was rare, and the market situation was weak. The evening market was 1.268 yuan. Korean notes were also weak, with the evening market at 1.11 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold notes rise by 0.25 yuan, American gold notes rise by 0.08 yuan, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.01 yuan, Canadian notes rise by 0.10 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>High Prices Induce Selling: Gold Prices Rise Before Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's informal market situation for raw gold was barely satisfactory. According to the potential of the previous day and the tightening of today's exchange market, a continued rise of dozens of yuan would not be unexpected. Unexpectedly, the result was a slight drop of three yuan. The reason is that the next three days are the New Year's holiday, including today, Sunday, for a total of four days off, causing general speculative longs to be extremely willing to close out with thin profits. Furthermore, the appetite of Hong Kong firms was weak. Although a certain foreign bank secretly bought more than 2,000 taels, the supply and demand were still difficult to match. However, the morning opening inherited the momentum of the previous day, rising again by 12 yuan, to 4,170 yuan. Although it once fell back, a certain money exchange suddenly searched fiercely on behalf of a foreign firm. At the same time, a certain bank also followed up, and the exchange market was slightly tight and soft, so it once pulled up, reaching 4,185 yuan. Unexpectedly, the high price induced selling. The money exchange was the first to come out, followed by the securities firms, gold shops, and silver shops, all competing to release. Until before the noon close, it had retreated to a low price of 4,150 yuan. The result was a closing price of 4,155 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, and the trend outside the market turned stable, and 4,160 yuan was still difficult to buy in. It was heard that sellers needed to ask for another 10 yuan. Transactions were rarely heard. The morning's transactions reached over 3,000 taels. Silver shop ornaments remained unchanged, and customs gold remained even.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Falls Three Yuan</p>
<p>Since the early morning, the initial opening was good, although the initial opening exchange was even. The market opened and immediately rose by 12 yuan, with securities firms buying 20 taels of gold, at 4,170 yuan. Shortly after, another securities firm and gold shop sold, immediately pressing down by slightly less than 10 yuan. A securities firm sold 10 taels to a money exchange, at 4,160 yuan. Afterwards, a certain money exchange suddenly showed a strong appetite, and a certain bank also bought in on behalf of customers, and the exchange market was slightly tight and soft, so although securities firms, gold shops, and silver shops all had intentions to supply, they all took the opportunity to raise prices, and were raised by 25 yuan. The money exchange bought 20 taels from a silver shop, at 4,185 yuan. Subsequently, buyers' appetites were satisfied, and another money exchange suddenly closed out on behalf of its firm for profit, soon falling back by 20 yuan. The money exchange sold 30 taels to a securities firm, at 4,165 yuan. Afterwards, gold shops and others bought in at low prices, raising it again by 10 yuan. A gold shop bought 30 taels from a money exchange, at 4,175 yuan. Then, the money exchange saw the high price and came to release again, and the gold shops suddenly turned to selling, and scattered longs closed out one after another, falling back by 25 yuan. A gold shop sold 10 taels to a securities firm, at 4,150 yuan. Later, the securities firm pulled in slightly again, raising it by 5 yuan, buying 20 taels from a gold shop, with a noon closing price of 4,155 yuan. As a result, it closed slightly smaller by 3 yuan than the previous day, with a difference of 35 yuan in half a day. The selling price of cash shops' gold was higher than raw gold by several yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold was lower than the listed gold by more than 50 yuan, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Remains Unchanged Throughout</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged throughout the day. Datonghang still hung at 420 yuan. New Tonghang was the same as the above price, with the purchase price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Indian Coal Sales Increase Daily</h3>
<p>Since the opening company temporarily stopped selling warehouse warrants the day before yesterday, Indian lump coal has been taking the lead in Shanghai, and sales are increasing daily. Daily transactions reach more than 1,000 tons, and the market price has risen by 10 yuan in a week. Owners are still unwilling to release lightly, intending to be bullish. The asking price for Calcutta lump coal is now 132 yuan per ton, but there are no large quantities of spot goods, in stark contrast to the sluggish sales of stove white coal.</p>
<h3>Grains: Food Security Assured in Shanghai; Over 40,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive Again; 1,700 Tons of Broken Rice Transacted; Sold at Special Low Prices for Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>The large quantities of early and late rice that arrived earlier were still being released in large quantities yesterday. It was also heard that the next batch of 13 trucks of goods, such as Huangqiao and Chuanlai Temple rice, had also arrived in Hongkou, but whether they could be transferred out of that area yesterday was still in question. Foreign rice in transit continued to arrive. In the early market, general sentiment was still bullish, and both local and foreign shops were actively trading. Sellers took the opportunity to raise prices by more than half a yuan. The price of early and late Nangang rice was 38.5 yuan, and Saigon pointed rice was 38 yuan. The situation at the time was quite tense, but ultimately, with the year-end closing approaching, merchants repeatedly released, and the market was suddenly flooded with goods. Seeing the abundance of chips, merchants were unwilling to enter rashly again, so sales slackened and the market stagnated. The market was difficult to sustain and the price fell back. As a result, the closing prices were 38.2 yuan for early and late Nangang rice, then to 37.9 yuan; 37.5 yuan to 37.2 yuan for Saigon pointed rice; 37.6 yuan to 37.3 yuan for Siamese pointed rice; 33 yuan for broken rice; 36.2 yuan for Tokyo special pointed rice; and 35 yuan decided to 34 yuan for market rice. Although it was still good compared to the previous market, it only increased by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The remaining such as Su Tong japonica rice was still 40 yuan, decided to 39 yuan; Qing Si special thin rice was 40 yuan, and market rice was 39.5 yuan; Feng Xi special thin rice was 39 yuan, decided to 38 yuan; Lu Yang pointed rice was 38-39 yuan; and White Yuan was 41-42 yuan. Because the prices were more expensive than other goods, and all were already at the limit, it was not easy to increase, and only presented a stable situation. Although there were inevitable differences in the quality of the goods, they were too minor to discuss. Statistics showed that the total number of transactions in the city was still limited, with the largest number not exceeding 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Customer indica rice continued to be silent, and the buying of foreign rice became more and more active. Due to the year-end holiday closures, shops and rural customers were adding supplies, and new arrivals were delayed because orders were not open for the holiday. Sellers were all raising prices. Saigon and Siamese were both raised to 37.5 yuan, and high-quality broken rice opened at 33.2 yuan, which was 0.3-0.5 yuan better than the previous day. Transit goods and original bags were rarely sold. However, in order to facilitate price stabilization, the firms reduced prices and sold batches of No. 2 Saigon and broken rice to the Adjustment Association, totaling 1,700 tons, with No. 2 original bags at 43.8 yuan and broken rice original bags at 35.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is continuously imported. Yesterday, the Taikoo company's Zephyr ship brought 5,085 bags directly from Saigon, 12,447 bags loaded from Hong Kong, and the company's Canton ship also brought 13,219 bags from Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng ship also brought 10,062 bags from Hong Kong, and another 1,711 bags were transferred to Tianjin. The three ships all arrived at port one after another yesterday morning and are currently being unloaded. (Ancestor)</p>
<h3>Holiday Flour and Wheat: Hoarding is Active</h3>
<p>Flour: Transactions were quite active on the street yesterday. Due to the upcoming New Year's holiday and the good market situation, before the factory prices were increased, the buying appetite was stronger. All factories maintained normal retail sales to local dealers, but refused to open to customer buyers. Reclaimed goods were unusually firm, rising by 0.4-0.5 yuan above the factory price. Total transactions in the city were over 20,000 bags. The buying interest in Phoenix Brand flour from Japanese factories was unusually strong. Due to rumors of rising prices in recent days, hoarders took this opportunity to buy in, raising January delivery to 9.08-09 yuan, a sharp increase of more than 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. It was also heard that February delivery opened at 9.2 yuan, but factories were unwilling to sell at 0.25 yuan above that. Today, 14,900 bags of flour will be shipped to Hong Kong. On January 1st next year, 3,500 bags will be shipped to Xiamen, and 16,000 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market was unusually firm yesterday. Due to the good flour market, sentiment was even stronger. Sellers were unwilling to provide samples for sale, and buyers were also watching due to the approaching year-end, and transactions virtually stopped. The market development will have to wait until after the New Year's holiday.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Optimistic, Foreign Stocks Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Securities Dark Market: Yesterday, only half-day trading was conducted, and settlement and market closure were processed in the afternoon. The half-day market conditions showed a stable trend. This was largely due to the Lunar New Year approaching, with four days of holidays. Both long and short positions sought temporary closure. In terms of news, the issuance of gold standard notes was unrelated to public bonds, but most transactions were concluded by retail investors, resulting in a trading volume of 400,000. Buyers still dominated, as ambassadors from various countries would soon gather in Chongqing, unrelated to the Sino-Japanese conflict. The opening market next year is expected to continue to be optimistic. Yesterday's half-day results showed a slight increase of about one or two jiao. The transaction volume was over 400,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Today is the weekly holiday. Holidays start from New Year's Day for three days. The market will resume normal operations from the 4th.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of the Gauze Exchange were traded at a price of 40 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Time flies, another year has passed. Recalling the major reforms implemented by the General Chamber of Commerce last time, with the implementation of the "Written Plate System" for transactions, it has been about a year. This system has proven its effectiveness and achieved remarkable success, earning praise from all sides. Despite the approaching holidays, yesterday's market conditions remained strong and active. Rubber stocks were as booming as before, and interest in industrial stocks also increased. China Merchant bonds and Ewo Cotton Mill stocks were the most active. Transactions in low-priced rubber stocks regained a significant position. However, general stable and strong investors seemed to be turning back to previously beloved stocks, such as British Chairs, Langkats, and rubber. When the market reopens on the fourth day of the New Year, China Merchant's 8% bonds will no longer be listed in the market list, and the company's stock quotation will be the new share price of 10 yuan par value. The delivery of the new shares must wait until the share certificates are printed.</p>
<p>London, 29th: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debts remained stable, with no changes in the upper and lower range prices. London, 29th: Today's listed prices of British Far East companies' stocks only saw HSBC shares fall by 1 pound each, with British registered shares priced at 81 pounds and 50 pence, and Hong Kong registered shares priced at 80 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Hoarding Active, Yarn Prices Soar, Jumping About Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to advance, with the situation becoming more enthusiastic. Market transactions were found to be 80% speculative, mainly involving factory futures transactions for January, February, and March. They were bought and sold in the market, creating a lively atmosphere, but actual sales remained sluggish, leading to increasing inventories. However, raw cotton remained firm and expensive, and hoarders' buying intentions remained strong. The market will be closed for three days from New Year's Day, the 29th year, and will reopen on January 4th, operating as usual.</p>
<p>The opening price of current yarn in the morning was driven by the rising trends in the American and Indian cotton markets, coupled with favorable rumors, attracting more buyers. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 750 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan compared to the previous day, quickly rising to 53 yuan. It was then rumored that there was no significant change in the exchange rate, causing a momentary drop back to 748 yuan. However, a certain firm made some purchases of January and February futures, shifting the trend upwards again. The yarn market fluctuated between 52 and 53 yuan for a long time, finally closing at 753.5 yuan. According to statistics, 1,585 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn increased by 10.05 yuan, Tian Nu (Celestial Woman) by 8 yuan, and Shuang Di Qiu (Double Earth) by 6 yuan. Today, 95 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. On January 1st next year, 555 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Siam, 280 pieces to Saigon, 220 pieces to Tu Le, 40 pieces to Hai Phong, 30 pieces to Hai Kou, and 60 pieces to Hong Kong. The quantities purchased by various regional groups are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 50, Yunnan: 310</p>
<p>Fellow Traders: 1,200, Inland: 25</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Rises Again, Cotton Firms Expect Optimistic Outlook</h3>
<p>Transactions in local cotton were relatively scarce. Factories mainly had one transaction with the Japanese-owned Shanghai factory, and no other purchases were reported. However, market sentiment was exceptionally excited due to the renewed upward trend in overseas Indian cotton. Therefore, fellow traders are again expecting a rise in prices. The origin of cotton from Northern Jiangsu is estimated to be 3,370 bales of Tong Hua cotton, 141 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 830 bales of Beisha cotton. The current cotton situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Dazhongji</p>
<p>23.00, Rong Fengjin: 100 bales</p>
<p>Fire Grass Bale: 160, Fellow Traders: 30 bales</p>
<p>Fire Grass Bale: 159.00-161.50, Also: 50 bales</p>
<p>Wooden Frame: 164.00, Also: 200 bales</p>
<p>American Type Packed: 185.00, Also: 204 bales</p>
<p>Also: 95.00, Shanghai Jin: 50 pieces</p>
<p>Sanyu American Type: 19.00, Fellow Traders: 100 bales</p>
<p>American Type Foreign Frame: 18.00, Also 158 pieces</p>
<p>Another Report: Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market showed active trading in the early morning yesterday. Market prices rose by 5 to 6 points compared to the previous day, and then rose again due to purchases by peers and short covering. As a result, the closing market situation was quite firm, with prices rising by 5 to 6 points for near-term contracts and 11 to 17 points for far-term contracts compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose nearly 10 rupees, Kanpur rose over 50 points, and Liverpool rose over 10 pence.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have been very quiet recently. No parties have expressed interest in purchasing. Those holding spot goods are temporarily unwilling to sell, as they firmly believe that the American cotton market will be optimistic again. Factories are preparing to close their accounts as the end of the year approaches, so transactions are rare. The factory price of yesterday's cotton, converted at an exchange rate of 7.5 yuan per US dollar, is listed below:</p>
<p>20-count American Memphis middling: 240.30</p>
<p>Also, Lower Grade: 235.95</p>
<p>32-count: 247.30</p>
<p>Also, Lower Grade: 41.20</p>
<p>42-count: 50.80</p>
<p>Also, Lower Grade: 242.95</p>
<h3>Grains: Japanese Merchants Dump Dalian Soybeans</h3>
<p>Oil Mills Purchase 100 Cars</p>
<p>Yesterday, soybean sales were mediocre due to the year-end closing period. Only hoarders made slight purchases at lower prices. The market trended towards tightness due to smooth arrivals. The Tongshi Street and hoarders purchased two cars of Nanjing soybeans, 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans, five cars of Dingjiazhou soybeans, and fifty bags of Chongmingsha soybeans, with prices around 2 jiao. It was also reported that Japanese firms dumped 100 cars of Dalian soybeans for January delivery outside the market at a price of 17.5 to 7 jiao. It is heard that oil mills were the main buyers, with only a few from Tongshi Street. Today, 1,135 bags of soybeans, 2,388 bags of raw kernels, and 800 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong. On New Year's Day, 2,800 bags of soybeans, 4,067 bags of raw kernels, 1,300 pieces and 995 cans of raw oil will also be shipped to Hong Kong. In addition, 1,020 bags of soybeans and 5,700 pieces of soybean cake will be shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugars Rebound</h3>
<p>Xiang Sugar: Those who could not hold out for long due to the Lunar New Year have already sold off their holdings in recent days. Therefore, yesterday's market rebounded upwards. The association priced current raw sugars at 24. The local firm's price was 58.8 yuan, an increase of 3 jiao.

<h3>Japanese Sentry Assaults Beautiful Woman, US Consulate Lodge Protest, Details Telegraphed to US State Department, Japanese Side Firmly Denies Incident</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reports that an official from the US Consulate stated this morning (30th) that although the Japanese Navy spokesman denied that American citizen Miss Donaldson was attacked by a Japanese sentry, the US Consulate in Shanghai had not received a written denial from the Japanese side. A summary of the incident was sent to the US State Department in Washington on Thursday. The official refused to comment on the Japanese Navy spokesman's remarks to reporters yesterday that Miss Donaldson's report "contains suspicious and unfounded accusations," but stated that the US Consulate's protest to Japanese Consul-General Miura on Thursday had not been answered.</p>
<p>US Consulate Note Demands Investigation</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the US Consulate-General's note to the Japanese authorities, referring to the incident in which American citizen Miss Donaldson was treated rudely by a Japanese sentry on the west side of the Sichuan Road bridge during the past week, was denied by the Japanese Navy spokesman yesterday (29th). The US Consulate's note requested the Japanese side to immediately investigate the matter and take disciplinary action against the sentry.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly Attacked on West Side</p>
<p>The account stated that according to Miss Donaldson's report, as she was passing over the Sichuan Road bridge to the west side of the bridge, she was struck in the chest by a Japanese sentry without warning, almost falling onto the sidewalk. This incident occurred between 7:50 PM and 8:00 PM on December 20th. The US Consulate's note was delivered to Japanese Consul-General Miura on December 28th.</p>
<p>A View from the Japanese Navy</p>
<p>The Japanese Army spokesman stated that the Japanese Marines had investigated and found that no such incident had occurred. In his opinion, the allegations in the note were questionable. Why had it taken a week after the alleged incident to bring it to the attention of the Japanese authorities? He could not help but have the opinion that the accusation had an ulterior motive and harbored malice towards Japan.</p>
<p>Similar Incidents Have Occurred Before</p>
<p>If such an incident had occurred, it would have been reported to the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters on the evening of the incident or at least the next day. The Japanese sentry stationed at the location at the time of the alleged incident had been questioned and all denied it. In previous incidents of the same nature, Public Concession police officers stationed on the bridge immediately reported to the Police Department and announced it. Furthermore, the Japanese side always selects capable and well-behaved sentries to be stationed on the bridges over the Suzhou Creek and strictly forbids them from interfering with European, American, or Chinese women.</p>
<h3>British Warship HMS Gannet Arrives from Hankou Near Shanghai</h3>
<p>Five British Warships Now in Shanghai, Three Ordered to Sail Elsewhere</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that after the British warship HMS Gannet arrived in Shanghai from Hankou today (30th), the number of British Yangtze River gunboats gathered in Shanghai will reach five. According to a British naval officer who told reporters yesterday (29th), three of them will soon leave Shanghai and sail to an undisclosed location. Since no orders have been given for the three ships to return to Hankou, they may be heading to Hong Kong. In addition to the HMS Gannet, the HMS Mosquito, HMS Scorpion, HMS Scarab, and HMS Gannet, and HMS Sea Gull arrived in Shanghai from Hankou three days ago. With three of them withdrawing following the five British gunboats that left the Central China waters in early autumn, only two British warships will remain in the Yangtze River squadron stationed in Shanghai.</p>

<p>British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, to discuss the Tianjin proposal and the opening of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River with the central authorities, was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the British Steamship Company's "McKenna" yesterday morning for Hong Kong and then Chongqing. However, the "McKenna" was delayed in arriving in Shanghai by one day, so the British Ambassador changed his plans to leave Shanghai today with</p>
<p>Chief Counselor</p>

<h3>Huang Hanzhi Has Not Left Shanghai</h3>
<p>Rumors of Departure for Hong Kong Incorrect</p>
<p>The rumor that Shanghai philanthropist Huang Hanzhi is about to go to Hong Kong on business is a misrepresentation. Mr. Huang is handling charitable affairs in Shanghai, and his affairs are heavy, so he cannot leave Shanghai for the time being. It is said that he is even busier during the winter relief period. The rumor of going to Hong Kong is not known where it came from.</p>
<h3>Today is Year-End, Market Stable</h3>
<p>Most Industries Have Surpluses, Foreign Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Today is the year-end closing period for the silver and banking industry in the 28th year of the Republic. All firms are rushing to finalize their accounts. According to the silver and banking industry, the various firms in the Shanghai concessions after the occupation have seen a sharp increase in deposits due to the concentration of floating capital in Shanghai. Funds are very abundant. Banks after the settlement can obtain considerable surpluses, so no unfortunate events have occurred in the market. Moreover, the foreign exchange rate in the money market yesterday remained at 1 jiao 5 fen, which proves that there is no tension in Shanghai's finances.</p>
<h3>US Consul-General Gauss to Return to Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>

<p>Departing Rapidly for Saigon to Return to His Country, All Parties Came to See Him Off</p>
<p>French Army Commander in Shanghai, Colonel Granié, was ordered to return to his country to participate in the war. He was scheduled to leave Shanghai next week, but due to the war in his homeland, he left Shanghai rapidly on the French postal ship "Chantilly" at 7:00 AM yesterday to Saigon, waiting for orders to transfer to the Western Front. Colonel Granié inspected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Defense Forces</p>

<p>The Wharf to See Him Off</p>
<p>Colonel Granié and his wife shook hands with the well-wishers one by one to say goodbye. After reviewing the ceremonial guard, he boarded the ship amid cheers. The ship left Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday for Saigon. Colonel Granié will stay in Saigon for a day or two before returning to France and transferring to the front line to participate in the battle. Colonel Granié graduated from the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in 1914. In the same year, he</p>
<p>Transferred to the Front During World War I</p>
<p>At that time, Colonel Granié was promoted to Second Lieutenant, and in 1915 to Lieutenant. During the war, Colonel Granié repeatedly made meritorious service. After the war, Colonel Granié remained in the country to serve, and was then transferred to Saigon, Indochina as commander. In 1928, he served as commander of the Second Battalion.

The successor to Colonel Granié as the French Army Commander in Shanghai will be Colonel Caversier, currently stationed in Tianjin, who will come to Shanghai to take over.</p>
<h3>Japanese Indicate to Municipal Council that They are Preparing to Return the Northern District, But it Depends on the Negotiation of Cross-Boundary Roads. The Pseudo-Government's Car Tax is Extended Indefinitely.</h3>
<p>United Press of America, Shanghai report: A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said today that the Japanese side is very likely to return the area north of Suzhou Creek to the Municipal Council as soon as possible. The development of this issue will depend on the development of the issue of jurisdiction over</p>
<p>Cross-Boundary Roads which is currently being held between the "Shanghai Municipal Government" and the Municipal Council. The spokesman also said that the issue of the area north of Suzhou Creek should have been resolved long ago, but it has been delayed until now due to the Kinloch incident in mid-August and the occurrence of various unfortunate events.</p>
<p>Still unresolved, but if the issue of jurisdiction over cross-boundary roads can be resolved, the Hongkou issue can be resolved sooner or later. The talks between the "Shanghai Municipal Government" and the Municipal Council are progressing well, so this is also a sign that the Hongkou issue can be resolved soon. Also, the English "China Press" reports that after the special request of the Italian Consul-General and Leader of the Consular Body in Shanghai, Mr. Chuan Xiao'an,</p>
<p>To postpone the collection of license fees for cars on cross-boundary roads. In his reply to Mr. Nilon, Mr. Chuan stated that there is no fixed term for the postponement of the collection of this fee, but the "Shanghai Municipal Government" has the freedom to issue a notice at any time</p>
<p>To implement the collection of license fees after fifteen days. A reporter asked the General Manager and Director of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, about the progress of the negotiations between the "Shanghai Municipal Government" and the Municipal Council on the suspension of the collection of license fees on cross-boundary roads. Mr. Fessenden replied that this is currently an unrelated matter, but it will obviously be discussed in the future. Currently,</p>
<p>It is gratifying to postpone it. Mr. Chuan is seeking to resolve the outstanding issue of cross-boundary roads first, so he has repeatedly postponed the collection of license fees for cars on roads outside the border. This is the third time.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Missionary Killed in Japanese Bombing</h3>

<h3>French Concession Municipal Council's Budget for the Coming Year Increases by 5 Million Yuan Compared to This Year, and Creates a New "Occupation License Tax"</h3>
<p>The French "Journal de Shanghai" reported on the 30th that at the meeting of the French Concession Municipal Council on December 27th, the current budget for 1940 was decided, with total revenues and expenditures of 16.8 million yuan. The budget for 1939 was only 11.98 million yuan. It is also heard that the reason for this large increase in the budget is actually due to</p>
<p>The rising cost of living. The reasons in Shanghai are the increase in freight and the price of imported goods. In addition, the cost of living allowances for officials of the Bureau will also be maintained for a full year. Due to the increase in expenditures, it is necessary to increase tax revenues. There are three items to be added, as follows: (1) Land tax: no increase in the eastern part of the French Concession, an increase of</p>
<p>One percent between Avenue Dubail to Route Pere Robert and Route des Soeurs. An increase of two percent in the French Concession area, plus an additional tax of one percent. (2) House tax: an increase of 13 percent to 15 percent uniformly, plus an additional tax of 2 percent. Therefore, the total house tax for next year will be 17 percent. (3) Other business license taxes are also largely</p>
<p>Increased to adapt to the cost of living within the concession. In addition, a new "General Occupation License Tax" has been created, that is, any individual or company residing in the French Concession, any person engaged in a profitable occupation, must obtain a license and pay taxes, but with some exceptions for exemption. It is said that the establishment of this general occupation license tax is to enable all residents of the concession to share the city tax equally, so as to share the benefits of its safety and protection.</p>
<h3>Silver and Banking Industries Exchange Preparation Committee's Fifth Inspection</h3>

<h3>Brokers Raise Rice Prices Excessively; Huang Renjie Sentenced to Detention; Ordering Broken Rice in Preparation</h3>
<p>Rice market brokers Yang Xiling, Huang Renjie, and Sun Yigu of Qinyi Rice Shop, among others, were found to have excessively raised prices at the Fourth Road rice market. The Public Works Department, intending to punish these unscrupulous individuals, filed a lawsuit against the brokers and obtained arrest warrants from the court. Huang Renjie was apprehended through the cooperation of the police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession. This morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court, and after trial, he was sentenced to 15 days of detention as a warning to others. The other two individuals are still at large, and the police of both concessions are cooperating in their arrest. The authorities of both concessions are determined to crack down on rice merchants who excessively raise prices and will prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law should similar situations be discovered in the future.</p>
<p>Circumstances of Detaining Rice Merchants Who Disobey Orders</p>
<p>Since the authorities repeatedly set price limits on rice, the Political Department of the Public Works Department's Police Office has dispatched Chinese detectives to supervise the market daily. On the 26th of the month, Chinese Detective No. 199 of the Political Department, while supervising the rice market, discovered that rice brokers Huang Renjie (age 41, from Pudong), Yang Xilin, and Sun Yigu were transacting deals for Xian rice at 36 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), clearly violating the set price limits. In addition to revoking the three individuals' entry permits, barring them from any further transactions in the market, they were taken to the police station for questioning and severe reprimands. Afterwards, the Public Works Department felt that it would be difficult to effectively enforce the price limits without punishing these individuals as a warning to others. After deliberation by the legal department of the Public Works Department, referring to the Shanghai Municipal Government's official letter of July 31, 1934, which notified the rice industry to comply with the twelve industry regulations, stipulating that in situations such as food price surges, official price limits must be strictly adhered to, a lawsuit was filed against Huang and the others with the First Special Court in accordance with Article 33 of the Violation of Police Regulations Act. The First Special Court issued an arrest warrant. Yesterday morning, detectives, together with the French police, apprehended Huang Renjie at No. 5 Rue Plessener. He was escorted to the Ninth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The Public Works Department's acting lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the facts, saying that the highest penalty under Article 33 of the Violation of Police Regulations Act was 15 days of detention or a fine of 15 yuan. However, under the current circumstances, merely imposing a fine of 15 yuan would not be enough to serve as a warning and deter hoarding. Therefore, he requested that the maximum bodily punishment be imposed according to law. Chinese Detective No. 199 testified regarding Huang Renjie's negotiation of the Xian rice transaction at 36 yuan per shi at the time. When questioned, Huang Renjie admitted the facts without denial, but said that he already knew his mistake and expressed deep regret. After verification by Judge Shen Shanzeng, Huang Renjie was sentenced to 15 days of detention as a warning to others. Huang was then taken away by the police for imprisonment.</p>
<p>Over 10,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive Yesterday</p>

<p>Ordering Broken Rice by Telegram to Stabilize Prices</p>
<p>The Civil Food Adjustment Association has ordered 1,500 tons (equivalent to 15,000 bags) of broken foreign rice from Saigon, which will soon be shipped to Shanghai for sale at subsidized prices. The details of the subsidized sales will be determined by the association. Registration for the ordered foreign rice will be temporarily suspended today as it is Sunday, and January 1st to 3rd are New Year's holidays, during which banks are closed. Registration will resume as usual on the 4th.</p>
<p>Meeting Today to Discuss Use of Funds</p>
<p>The Civil Food Adjustment Fund has been increased to 2 million yuan. In addition to the 820,000 yuan already committed, efforts are underway to raise the remaining amount. The association has scheduled a meeting at noon today at the Hong Kong Road Banking Club, inviting all businesses that have committed funds to discuss the use of the funds. The Civil Food Adjustment Association also held its second standing council meeting yesterday. The chairman reported that 170 businesses had submitted applications for registration to order foreign rice. Payments totaling 100,500 yuan, at 20 yuan per bag, had been paid to the trust department of Jin Cheng Bank, equivalent to 5,005 bags.

<h3>Grand Joint Celebration Banquet for British and French Nationals in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that the Shanghai Royal Air Force Association held a weekly banquet yesterday (29th) afternoon at the association's headquarters in the HSBC Building. Guests included French Consul General Gibautte des Hayes, First Secretary Faulquier, French military attaché Colonel Yefeng, French air force attaché Lieutenant Colonel Natou, commander of the French gunboat Marne Baping, and chief of the French police department Faber.</p>
<p>Lively Atmosphere</p>
<p>The atmosphere was harmonious, reminiscent of the spirit between Britain and France in 1914. Association President Sir Sassoon delivered a speech, stating that it was an honor to have the Shanghai French dignitaries present at the banquet. It showed the world that the solidarity between Britain and France was not mere propaganda. He believed that some of those present had participated in the last World War and expressed hope</p>
<p>to Return to the Front Lines</p>
<p>But the unfinished tasks were now the responsibility of the younger generation. Today, Britain and France were not fighting for glory and wealth, but only for the protection of human dignity. Having drawn their swords, they would not sheathe them until the dictators' desires to enslave neighboring countries and their own people were completely thwarted. Sir Sassoon's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause. When asked to toast Britain and France, everyone raised their glasses and</p>
<p>Sang Songs</p>
<p>Baudet des Hayes then rose to give a reply, expressing his pleasure and gratitude. After his speech, the audience applauded. As the banquet was about to end, Sir Sassoon rose again and said that he had something that everyone would be pleased to hear. He had learned that Britain's elite air force squadrons were stationed in major cities and that those fighting in Scotland were the so-called "Banker's Battalion," whose members were all volunteers who had not received extensive training and were transferred to Scotland when the war broke out.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case on Avenue Foch is the Work of the Japanese Consulate; Chinese Citizens Kidnapped by Consulate Police; Bureau Protests and Awaits Report for Decision</h3>

As of now, the Public Works Department has not received an apology from the Japanese consulate. The bureau is now awaiting a report from the police department before deciding on the protest. As for the kidnapped individuals and their printed materials, they were released yesterday afternoon after negotiations by the police department.</p>

<h3>Physicians Establish Ethical Stance; Voluntarily Cancel Prescription Commissions; Serving the Pharmaceutical Industry Should Be Done with Compassion; Please Immediately Remove Old Habits to Benefit Patients</h3>
<p>Most pharmacies have traditionally paid commissions to physicians for prescriptions. This practice has been in place for many years and is difficult to change. Now, leading physicians in Shanghai, including Diao Xinde, Wang Wanbai, Wang Shuzhen, Zhu Yanggao, Yu Yunxiu, Xu Naili, Shi Siming, Fu Wenshou, Lu Zhaozhang, Cao Fangshou, and others, have taken an ethical stance and voluntarily initiated a circular to all pharmacies to completely eliminate this bad habit starting from the New Year. It is now heard that the Shanghai Physicians Association and the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Medical Association have taken</p>
<p>Collective Action to Support This Move. Furthermore, renowned major pharmacies such as Wu Zhou and Zhong Xi have also decided to comply after receiving the circular. The circular from the physicians is as follows: "Dear Manager, Since the war began, the cost of rice and firewood has skyrocketed, and the people are struggling to make a living. Although we are part of today's society, we have failed to help the world and save the critical situation. Reflecting on ourselves, we feel deeply ashamed. Since various countries have advocated the 'Moral Re-Armament' movement, and reflecting on the absolute</p>
<p>Moral Standards of Christ, including sincerity, purity, selflessness, and universal love, we feel even more inadequate and ashamed. In this difficult time, we should lead by example and extend this to others. Moreover, serving the medical and pharmaceutical professions should be done with compassion. Now that medicines are expensive, buyers are hesitant to purchase them. To alleviate the suffering of patients, we kindly request that your establishment eliminate all commission payments for our prescriptions, X-rays, and tests from the first day of the 29th year of the Republic. This type of income is unjust, harms others for personal gain, and</p>
<p>troubles our conscience. If we continue this bad habit, it would severely violate ethical principles. We solemnly declare and hope you will take this into consideration and comply. We also hope that you will extend this innovative goodwill to other physicians so that our medical and pharmaceutical professions can, from now on, unanimously adhere to integrity and uphold morality. This is our earnest prayer."</p>

<p>Bandits Rampage and Rob in Gangs</p>
<p>At 11:40 AM yesterday, sixteen or seventeen bandits, each carrying a Mauser pistol, broke into the Anfeng Customs Brokerage at No. 5, Lane 33, Zilai Street. Several stood guard outside, while the rest split up to rob. In addition to the brokerage being robbed of over 2,000 yuan, resident Hu Zhimei on the second floor lost 560 yuan, He Yunshan on the third floor lost two diamond rings, Feng Shenzhuang lost over 100 yuan, and Gu Qikui's family lost over 100 yuan. While the bandits were searching for loot, the lookout suddenly noticed a large group of detectives arriving and, thinking that the plan had failed, notified the other bandits. The lookout bandits then opened fire on the detectives.</p>
<p>Opening Fire to Resist Arrest; Two Bandits Captured</p>
<p>After the gunfire started, the detectives scattered and began to encircle and arrest the bandits, returning fire. The bandits also resisted arrest forcefully, and a fierce gun battle ensued. The number of shots fired by both sides was like rain, totaling forty or fifty. Residents in the lane, hearing the dense gunfire, fled into their homes. Fortunately, no one was injured by the stray bullets. The bandits, unable to hold out, climbed onto the roofs and fled outwards. As a result, two bandits were captured on the spot, and two Mauser pistols and over ten bullets were confiscated. They were taken back to the police station and are currently being interrogated to identify their accomplices and bring them to justice. The two bandits will be sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution after the investigation is completed.</p>
<h3>Men and Women Commit Suicide in the Asia Travel Agency; Woman is a Guide Society Member</h3>
<p>A man and a woman arrived at Room 244 of the Asia Travel Agency at 571 Hankou Road the night before last. The man claimed to be Zhang Chuan, 30 years old, and the woman, Zhang, 20 years old. They were very affectionate and seemed like a married couple. They slept until about 12:30 PM the next day, when, for unknown reasons, they both had suicidal thoughts and committed suicide by drinking poisonous liquid. A waiter discovered them and immediately called for an ambulance to take them to the hospital for treatment. It was later learned that the woman was a member of a certain Guide Society. Due to lack of freedom in marriage, they decided to act as lovebirds who die together.</p>
<p>Chen Liming, a 25-year-old native of Ningbo, was a coppersmith living at No. 2, Baxian Lane, Rue des Soeurs, in the French Concession. Recently, he had lost a lot of money due to gambling and was unable to repay his debts. He had suicidal thoughts and swallowed poisonous liquid at around 5:30 PM yesterday. He was discovered by someone and taken to Baolong Hospital by a friend. He died at 7:15 PM despite treatment.</p>
<h3>Demolition Causes Disaster; Over Ten Japanese Soldiers Injured or Killed</h3>
<p>Behind the Shanghai Middle School on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, there was originally a Hengjing Temple, with three courtyards in the front and back, and spacious buildings. It was built by imperial decree during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty and has been passed down to this day, with a thriving incense offering. At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, dozens of Japanese soldiers stationed in Shanghai Middle School went to the temple to dismantle and take wood for use as firewood. Unexpectedly, while they were working, the main hall of the central courtyard suddenly collapsed with a crash, injuring over ten Japanese soldiers on the spot. Two of them died from their injuries, which were too severe to be treated. The others were taken to the Fenglin Bridge Military Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Soldiers Rob a Shop; Two Arrested</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the "Baojia System" in the Pudong area, robberies have become even more rampant every night. At around 2:00 AM yesterday, a group of over twenty bandits suddenly arrived at the tobacco and paper shop opened by Wu Ziquan, a local resident near Shenjia Lane. Wielding weapons, they robbed the shop of over 300 yuan in legal tender and valuable items from the house before escaping. Three bandits were caught by the puppet police because they were slower to escape. After being tortured, six more male and female criminals were apprehended, and two hand grenades and one pistol were recovered. They are currently being interrogated by the "Investigation Detachment." It is heard that they confessed that they were living as fake "soldiers."</p>
<h3>Construction Factory Owner Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Xu Chuyuan, a 49-year-old local resident who owns the Jinmingji Construction Factory, residing at No. 36, Lane 362, Daxi Road, was kidnapped by three bandits, each carrying a pistol, while traveling in his own car (No. 9985) at around 8:45 AM yesterday. One of the bandits drove the car. Unexpectedly, the car had special mechanics, which the bandit was not familiar with, so he was unable to drive it. At this time, the Jing'an Temple Police Station had already received the news and quickly dispatched detectives to the scene. The bandits, upon discovering this, abandoned Xu and fled without a trace. Xu was fortunate to escape.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Crushes Pedestrian's Legs</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Xinzha Road and Wenzhou Road in the Public Concession, a No. 10 public bus, traveling from west to east, struck pedestrian Hang Youcai, 50 years old, at around 8:30 AM yesterday. He was knocked down because the bus was unable to stop in time. The bus wheels crushed both of his legs. The police arrived, recorded the driver's information, and sent the injured man to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>New Zha Bridge Requires Payment of Bridge Tax</h3>
<p>Pedestrians on New Zha Bridge traveling from Beizha to the Concession are being forced to pay a bridge tax if they are carrying chickens, ducks, fish, or meat. For example, one chicken or duck requires a payment of 5 jiao (unit of Chinese currency), and one yuan for fish or meat, or sometimes as low as 3 to 4 jiao. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to cross the bridge.</p>
<h3>YWCA Arranges Advance Purchase of Rice for Members</h3>
<p>Due to the recent surge in rice prices and the difficulty of purchasing rice, the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road has initiated an advance purchase of rice for its members. It is heard that the price is fixed at 20 yuan per shi. Friends and relatives of the association who wish to purchase rice in advance should contact the association before January 4th or 5th. The telephone number is 34924.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wu Xinshu, the manager of the Xinxin Copper and Iron Manufacturing Factory, the news item on the Xinzha Road fire in the "Local News" section of the Shen Bao on the 29th of this month, which stated that the fire originated at our factory, is not in accordance with the facts. The fire started in the shantytown and spread eastward, affecting our bamboo fence first and then the factory building. This was witnessed by all the firefighters on the scene. As this concerns the reputation of our factory, we request that you correct the statement in the letter below.</p>
<p>We send this letter on their behalf and hope you will check and correct the information.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Dai Ningrui</p>

<h3>Tian Bao Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather in Shandong, this area, and the Chinese coast will be clear and cold, with cloudy skies in several places and unchanged winter monsoon conditions. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 55.2 degrees and the lowest was 27.1 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 42.6 degrees and the lowest was 20.5 degrees.</p>

<p>Weekly Supplement</p>
<h3>Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The last day of each year is called New Year's Eve, meaning to get rid of the old and welcome the new, which everyone knows. The last month of each year is also called Deeming Month, as seen in the Book of Compilations of Emperor Yuan of Liang, but it is not often used. So today is Deeming Month New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>After twenty-four hours, it will be "tomorrow," but when speaking of "tomorrow" today, if the meaning is broad, it can also mean "next year." For example, when parting with a friend, "See you tomorrow!" can be changed to "See you next year!" Logically, there is no difference, and at this time, "day" and "year" are interchangeable.</p>
<p>Of course, next year will have a new atmosphere and new developments that we cannot foresee; but what we already know, such as the establishment of Guilin as a city, the collection of excessive profit taxes, and the National Savings Movement, will all begin on New Year's Day, which is to say, beginning "tomorrow."</p>
<h3>European War and Espionage</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>After the First European War, espionage activities of various countries became highly active. Their actions were often unpredictable and difficult to defend against. Although appearing ordinary, their methods were extremely agile, and their attention was deeply focused. They could devise all sorts of methods to accomplish their important missions. The following examples are just a few.</p>
<p>The embassy of a certain country employed a woman with an unattractive appearance, whose daily task was to clean windows. The embassy had always been very strict about guarding against espionage, and no one was allowed to take anything out after work. However, this woman was actually a spy. While cleaning the glass windows, she used five secret actions to wipe the glass, one to the left, one to the right, one up, one down, and one diagonally. Another spy would watch her actions from a distance and quickly record them. Therefore, all the secrets of the embassy were completely stolen by her.</p>
<p>There was a Soviet spy who specialized in using photographic equipment. He lived in a Western-style house near the British government office building and photographed all the discarded paper scraps in the vicinity from the air. It is said that the secrets of the British government stolen by him in this way were not few.</p>
<p>Another Soviet spy used the method of cooking eggs. These eggs were mixed with ordinary raw eggs, coated on the outside with a sugar alum solution, and the inside was written with text using a medicinal solution. Once the egg was cooked, black text would appear.</p>
<p>Many French spies were beautiful women. Their gloves, coat pockets, and seams of their clothes were all places to hide secret telegrams.</p>
<p>Since the invention of infrared light lamps, spies from various countries have known how to use them to transmit signals, and news could be obtained from miles away. Other scientific methods are too numerous to mention.</p>
<h3>If the Battle Line is 1,000 Kilometers...</h3>
<p>If the battle line is 1,000 kilometers long, how much manpower, financial resources, and material resources will the attacking and defending parties need?</p>
<p>The attacking side needs at least four million troops, while the defending side needs from one and a half million to two million. The frontline soldiers all need the labor force in the rear to transport supplies. Each soldier of the defending army needs ten people, and each soldier of the attacking army needs twelve people. Therefore, to ensure the smooth operation of the four million attacking troops, the rear needs 48 million laborers.</p>
<p>During a major war, 400 million tons of coal are needed each year. If each miner can dig 0.8 tons of coal per day, then a population of 500 million is needed.</p>
<p>In terms of weapons, what the attacking army needs is:——</p>
<p>Machine guns: 200,000, Large cannons: 45,000</p>
<p>Rifles: 30,000, Anti-aircraft guns: 50,000</p>
<p>Armored vehicles: 40,000, Transport vehicles: 30,000</p>
<p>The defending side generally needs half of what the attacking army needs.</p>
<p>Then calculate the steel needed annually for weapons, artillery shells, etc.:——</p>
<p>The attacking army needs 37.3 million tons, and the defending army needs 15.75 million tons. In other words, each soldier consumes 70 to 80 tons of steel annually.</p>
<p>In addition, a list of indispensable materials is as follows:——</p>
<p>Therefore, war is truly a drain on manpower and resources, especially for aggressor nations. If their gambles fail and they encounter strong resistance, their losses will definitely be more than double, or even three or four times greater than those of the invaded country.</p>
<h3>The Instigators of the European War</h3>
<h3>How to Calculate the Day of the Week Next Year</h3>
<p>Calculating the day of the week for a certain day next year is extremely convenient. Just count the total number of days from January 1st to that day. (The number of days in each month is fixed in the solar calendar, making it very easy to calculate.) Divide by seven, and the remainder is the day of the week. If there is no remainder, then it is Sunday.</p>
<p>For example: What day of the week is March 15th? January has 31 days, February is a leap year with 29 days (which year is a leap year is also fixed, see the article). March 15th totals 75 days. Dividing by seven leaves a remainder of five, which is Friday.</p>
<h3>Flattered and Alarmed</h3>
<p>— Huan Lan</p>
<p>An article titled "Agreable Surprise" in the November 1939 issue of Time magazine is well worth reading; and translating this title into a Chinese idiom is quite accurate. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>In late October 1939, the Nobel Prize Committee in Stockholm, Sweden, announced the 1938 (delayed from the previous year) and 1939 prizes for physiology and medicine. The physiologist who should receive the prize is Professor Corneille Heymans of Belgium. He discovered that stimulation causes blood pressure to rise and fall, as well as chemical changes that affect breathing. These contributions have greatly benefited the treatment of respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>The medicine prize was given to Professor Gerbard Domak of Germany. This is where the problem arose. It turned out that in 1935, when the Nobel Prize was given to the German tuberculosis expert Achilles Keys, Hitler issued an order prohibiting Germans from accepting the Nobel Prize in the future. This time, the committee was ignorant of the rules and chose another German, causing Professor Gerhart to be at a loss when he received the news.</p>
<p>When he asked the government for instructions on how to handle the matter, he murmured, "Even if I don't accept his prize, the honor of being nominated has already greatly alarmed me."</p>
<h3>Finnish Tidbits</h3>
<p>Finland has 65,000 lakes and marshes, which can be used for military defense.</p>
<p>Finland has a population of four million. Seventy-five percent of Finland's exports are timber.</p>
<p>During the harvest season, Finns work especially hard because the sun sets at 11 p.m. If they "rest during the day," the day is particularly long.</p>
<p>Helsinki, the capital of Finland, currently has a population of 300,000, but in 1810 it was just a small village.</p>
<p>The Finnish language is one of the most difficult languages in the world to learn.</p>
<h3>Common Sense About the Earth</h3>
<p>— Zhen Ming</p>
<p>The distance from the Earth to the Sun is 92.83 million miles. If you travel by the fastest airplane today, which travels at 240 miles per hour, flying non-stop day and night would take forty-four years.</p>
<p>The distance from the Earth to the Moon is 239,000 miles. If you traveled by airplane in the same way, it would take over forty days.</p>
<p>The center of the Earth is liquid, and the thickness of the outer crust is 50 kilometers.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is at least 100 kilometers thick. Every cubic meter weighs 1.29 kilograms, and every square centimeter of the Earth's surface is subjected to an air pressure of 1.033 kilograms.</p>
<p>Brief Research</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Paper Ring on Cigars</h3>
<p>Isn't there a paper ring like a waistband around cigars? The packaging is very beautiful, but what is its purpose? It is said that the origin of this small paper ring is related to women.</p>
<p>Originally, in colonial times, Spanish noblewomen in Cuba casually smoked cigars to show their nobility and ease, but at the same time, they were afraid that the color of the tobacco leaves would stain their snow-white fingers. Therefore, a paper ring was added to the cigar to protect the fingers so that they would not come into contact with the tobacco leaves. However, as it has been passed down to the present, the original intention of using the paper ring no longer exists.</p>
<h3>Artificial Food</h3>
<p>The earliest researcher of artificial food was Dr. Maurice Bribois of France. He studied it for ten years, and in 1930, he successfully manufactured fruit powder from fresh fruits such as bananas, apples, and grapes for drinking.</p>
<p>Since the success of Dr. Maurice Bribois' fruit powder, it has aroused the interest of scientists around the world. Soviet scientists are the most enthusiastic. They organized the Artificial Food Research Institute and began practical research in 1934. They had an ideal of reducing the volume of bread to one-hundredth or one-fiftieth while still containing the original nutrients and being able to be stored for a long time without spoiling. At the time, it was just an ideal, and no one believed it would come true.</p>
<p>However, according to a recent report in the Russian newspaper Moscow Telegraph: Soviet scientist S. Y. Karayevoy finally succeeded this spring after five years of research. This was an accidental success. He accidentally made a substitute for bread synthesized from chemical drugs. This thing can be made into powder or lozenges, and every three centimeters in weight can抵半抵 half a pound of black bread. Its cost is only one-fifteenth to one-twentieth of half a pound of black bread.</p>
<p>The success of artificial food is not only a major invention in the scientific community but also a major revolution in the struggle for survival!</p>

<h3>Concluding Remarks for the Year 1939</h3>
<p>— Rong Mei</p>
<p>Today is the last day of the Republic of China's 28th year. Time flies so fast. Next year's New Year's Day seems to be right in front of us, without any blurriness. In the blink of an eye, it's the end of the year, and another long year of three hundred and sixty-five days has flown by like this.</p>
<p>All public or private institutions, as of today, finalize the accounts of income and expenditure for the year, which evokes our memories.</p>
<p>In this year, the Second European War terrifyingly broke out. Although currently only England, France, Finland, Germany, and the Soviet Union are in a state of war, a spark can ignite a prairie fire, and the flames of war are very likely to spread. However, we, who love justice and peace, always hope that the god of peace will arrive soon. Even more pitiful is Poland, which was revived after the European War, but was swallowed up by the aggressors this year. Our country's War of Resistance has entered a tense stage. In short, this year is a year of war and chaos, giving us the lesson that "resistance to aggression is the only way to survive."</p>
<p>In this year, Shanghai was surrounded by a speculative and hoarding atmosphere, and the prices of all goods soared in a straight line, leading to a trend of the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer. In short, this year is a year of soaring prices, but it can also cultivate our habit of thrift.</p>
<p>Finally, children also need to take stock today and make a brief review of themselves this year: You are all a year older. I think your parents must love you very much, making new clothes for you to wear, giving you candy to eat, giving you money to spend, and buying toys for you to play with. But have you been studying hard at school? Have you learned more new characters? Have you gained more knowledge? If not, then you are too sorry for your parents. Because they love you so much, they hope that you will study hard. It can be said that their hearts are always on you. How can you not study hard to repay them?</p>
<p>These few superficial words can be regarded as my year-end gifts. Children, after reading the above few sentences, do not treat them as perfunctory reviews. I hope you will correct your mistakes if you have them, and work harder if you don't! And I wish you a happy New Year!</p>
<h3>New Hope</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>A year has passed, and tomorrow will be the beginning of another year. We must also have some new hopes to be our pioneers in the coming year. I can say that your new hopes must be many, and the following are unavoidable.</p>
<p>First, regarding personal aspects, hoping to study harder, hoping to become physically stronger day by day, and hoping to improve character.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the country, hoping for victory in the War of Resistance, hoping for complete territorial integrity, and hoping for a happy life for the people.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the world, hoping that all countries can treat each other with sincerity, and hoping that the world can be at peace.</p>
<p>Children who have these hopes are progressive and good. However, I believe that all of the above are not new hopes. You must be asking: "Why?" Let me answer in a moment. I first want to ask you a question: "When you celebrated the New Year last year, you must have also expressed some new hopes, right? Please compare them with this year's to see if there are any similarities?" At this time, you will surely suddenly realize that the so-called "new hopes" of yours have been old news for several years. At this point, let me put forward a truly new hope. It is also very simple, that is, hoping that you can start from today to gradually realize the hopes you already have, turn them into reality, and not let them become "daydreams" or "fantasies" and be passed down year after year. These few words can be taken as my New Year's gift to you. Please accept them sincerely.</p>
<h3>Mr. Sun Yat-sen Doesn't Forget to Read on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Chen Sipi</p>
<p>Children: Time passes very quickly. In the blink of an eye, today is the last day of the Republic of China's 28th year. From tomorrow onwards, it will be the beginning of the 29th year. Now, I have written a story about Mr. Sun Yat-sen not forgetting to read on New Year's Day as a small New Year's gift for you!</p>
<p>When Mr. Sun was in Japan, one New Year's Day, his friend came to invite him to go sightseeing. At that time, Mr. Sun was buried at his desk, studying diligently. Seeing his friend come to invite him, he said, "Now that the country is in turmoil, my heart is only on the revolution, not on the mountains and rivers." He declined to go. His friend then said to him, "Today is a New Year's holiday, can't you go out for a visit?" Mr. Sun smiled and replied, "It is precisely because it is a holiday that I have the opportunity to continue reading and gain some knowledge. If it were not a holiday, then even if I were studying national affairs, I would feel that there is no moment of free time!" Mr. Sun did not forget to study even on New Year's Day. How admirable!</p>
<p>Children: After reading this short story above, what are your thoughts?</p>
<h3>Legend of Celebrating the New Year</h3>
<p>— Shen</p>
<p>It is said that more than four thousand years ago, there was a creature in the world called "Nian" (年, year). This animal was very large and liked cold weather. On the night of the end of each year and the beginning of the next year, it would come out to eat people. Therefore, people at that time were fearful of it and had no way to stop its activities. So, at this time, everyone treated it as a hurdle, which is now called "Nian Guan" (年關, year-end hurdle). Also, because they escaped being eaten by Nian, the first day of the following year was called "New Year." Later, humans gradually became smarter and thought of a way, which was to hang red things during the New Year's Eve, because Nian was most afraid of red. So, if a family hung red things, Nian would not dare to approach. Thus, humans gained a more stable life. Therefore, even now, in old-fashioned families, red cloth curtains are still hung outside the doors or bedrooms, or red paint is painted on the doors. But they think it is auspicious, which is actually a mistake. Also, why do people say "Congratulations, congratulations" on the first day of the new year? This is because they are congratulating each other for not being eaten by Nian. Also, why do people prepare many dishes? Because although Nian likes to eat people, it will not abandon delicious food. Therefore, humans used this reason to make Nian forget about eating people when it sees delicious food. While it is eating the dishes, humans can escape to avoid death. Later, because Nian's reproductive capacity was weak, it gradually became extinct. Nian no longer exists now. But the preventive measures of the past are still preserved. But because Nian is gone, there are many things to enjoy. For example, the dishes are eaten by oneself, hanging red symbolizes peace and prosperity in all seasons, and congratulating each other is for everyone to have lived another year. Therefore, the meaning of celebrating the New Year now is different from the meaning of celebrating the New Year in the past! It is only the same as the Dragon Boat Festival for commemorating Qu Yuan by eating zongzi and the Mid-Autumn Festival for commemorating Chang'e by eating mooncakes.</p>
<h3>Little Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Time is really like flowing water. After today, another year is over. We all know that what is called passing a year, astronomically speaking, is that the Earth has revolved around the Sun once, taking more than 365 days. How much more exactly? Can all you children answer? It is fixed, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds more. For this reason, there is one leap day in February every four years.</p>
<p>What I have talked about above is all calculated from the solar calendar. As for our old lunar calendar, it takes eleven or twelve days longer to pass a year. Therefore, there are two leap months every five years. This is calculated based on the Moon revolving around the Earth. From this, it can be seen that the solar calendar is much more accurate than the lunar calendar in terms of calculation.</p>
<h3>Blue Dwarf (14)</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>Ah Li had remembered everything from the past, and told the old dwarf about it. The old man also spoke a lot, but Ah Li didn't understand much, only understanding a few sentences like "lost" "poor child" "poor child." Finally, he told Ah Li that he also happened to be coming from that village, only to take a shortcut, so he took this road in the forest, but unexpectedly encountered her. After he finished speaking, he held the lamp in his hand high, clearly indicating that he was leading the way and telling Ah Li to follow him.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, just now Ah Li was going back and forth, unable to find the way, but now, under the leadership of the old man, in less than ten minutes, they arrived at the small inn. Poor her aunt and A Li were anxiously waiting for her, running back and forth in front of the store, without any idea what to do. Her uncle, along with the store owner and the coachmen, were carrying lanterns and looking for her in the forest. The innkeeper was comforting her aunt, saying that there was no need to worry too much, because there were no wolves or bears or other wild animals in this area, nor were there any bad people who would abduct children. The little girl must have been tired after a busy day, and fell asleep somewhere in the forest. She would come back by herself after dawn.</p>
<p>The innkeeper actually guessed some of it right. Now Ah Li is back, but she would never have expected that this little girl had been to the dwarves' village in her sleep and was entertained by the blue dwarves. As for the old dwarf who led her back, he was a famous local resident nearby, and he was very kind. Ah Li's aunt thanked him and gave him two yuan, and he went away happily. After a few minutes, her uncle rushed back to see if there was any news about his niece. When he saw that Ah Li had already returned, he was naturally happy beyond words.</p>
<p>Ah Li's return was really a coincidence. It turned out that after dawn, the sky was always dark, as if it was going to rain. Less than half an hour after she returned, a big storm broke out. Her aunt happily said to Ah Li, "You were lucky to come back a little earlier. If you hadn't come back by now, wouldn't we have been worried to death?" Ah Li looked at the terrible storm outside the door and felt very fortunate in her heart. Then, she told her aunt about her motive for visiting the blue dwarves. Her aunt said regretfully, "I shouldn't have joked with you before and said some things about the dwarves, arousing your curiosity, which caused this incident. From now on, I have to be more careful and not joke with you children anymore." So, Ah Li also told her aunt that from now on, she would be satisfied with reading about fairies and monsters in books and would never go looking for real fairies and monsters again.</p>
<p>Finally, she suddenly said with a smile, "Auntie, but I regret not eating the blue dwarves' dinner. The smell seemed very delicious." Her aunt laughed and said, "You must be dreaming. You can't really eat it there." Ah Li pondered for a moment, and then suddenly asked, "Auntie, when you and Uncle and A Li came back last night, did you sing along the way?" Her aunt hurriedly said, "Yes, they wanted me to sing a song 'Home, Sweet Home.' I was so happy that I sang it out loud. Why did you ask about this?" Ah Li nodded and said, "Oh, I see. I thought the blue dwarves were singing, but it turned out to be your voices." Her aunt smiled and gave her a sweet kiss. (The End)</p>

<h3>The Play Lineup for New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Jin Yuanliang</p>
<p>Starting from the year 1940, the theater scene in the isolated island will become more vibrant due to the addition of the "China Traveling Troupe" as a new force, right? The plan for the year lies in the spring. We certainly have no way of knowing the annual plans of each theater troupe, but from the programs performed on New Year's Day, we can always see some clues.</p>
<p>The first thing to mention is naturally the Shanghai Drama Society, which has been fighting in the isolated island for more than a year. After the society started its second long-term performance at the Lafayette Theater with Sardou's "Fatherland" as the first shot, it has been a box office success to this day. From New Year's Day, it was originally said that Jiang Qi's "Chen Yuanyuan," directed by Bai Lang, would be performed. Now that we have confirmed the news, "Fatherland" will be performed through New Year's Day, and perhaps "Chen Yuanyuan" will not be performed until January 4th or 5th.</p>
<p>As for the "China Traveling Troupe," according to the troupe's previous publicity, it was originally going to perform Wei Ruohei's "Empress Dowager Cixi," directed by Wu Yonggang. In addition to Tang Ruoqing and the entire members of the "China Traveling Troupe," Wang Xichun and Liu Qiong were also added as guest performers. Its ability to attract audiences is naturally not weak. However, now it is proceeding cautiously and striving for excellence in all aspects such as costumes and props. Therefore, it has decided to postpone the performance and first stage Wu Yonggang's "Lin Chong Flees at Night." Wu Yonggang originally wrote and directed the film "Lin Chong's Revenge in the Snowy Night," which won unanimous praise. This time, he is already familiar with the subject, so it will naturally be even more extraordinary. Moreover, the troupe leader, Tang Huaiqiu, volunteered to star in it himself. The excellent results can of course be predicted. Tang Huaiqiu is a veteran of the theater world. He has rarely appeared on stage in recent years. This time, he volunteered, and his reputation is even more conceivable.</p>
<p>Then there's Green Bin. Although some people see Green Bin as a civilized drama troupe, it is really impossible to underestimate them because they have been striving to improve and working hard recently. From New Year's Day, they were also originally planning to perform Liu Yixin's "Empress Dowager Cixi." Later, after hearing that "China Traveling Troupe" was going to perform it, in order to avoid competing with them, they voluntarily postponed the performance to January 6th. From New Year's Day, they will present Hu Liaoran's "Miss Piti 金." It is said that this play is a satirical comedy, with various interpolations about the photography studio.</p>
<h3>The Most Popular Play in Shanghai This Year</h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>Another year has passed. The theater scene in Shanghai this year has been particularly lively, even more so than before the war. In total, the play that has been most able to attract audiences and the most popular this year is:</p>
<p>(1) "Battle of Changsha." This play was made popular by Zhou Xinfang and his disciples. Not long ago, Xinfang, Zhao Ruquan, and Yuan Shihai sang it at a private party at the magistrate's office, making it even more popular. So this play became a standard attraction. Zhou Xinfang has performed it countless times this year. Huang Jin'geng's "Beijing opera actors" have all performed this play, and amateur performers also love to sing it. Recently, Lin Shusen performed it on the stage of the Great Theater. Unexpectedly, this "Battle of Changsha," which has become an antique, has had great luck in 1939.</p>
<p>(2) "Er Jin Gong." Because of the popularity of "Battle of Changsha," all the old plays that had not been performed for a long time became attractive plays. In addition to "Battle of Changsha," "Er Jin Gong" is also the most popular play this year. However, this play is only performed by Beijing opera actors in Shanghai. However, because Yan Jupeng, Wang Yurong, and Zheng Bingru all sold out every performance of this play, it is also listed as the most popular play.</p>
<p>(3) "Wen Suchen." This is a miracle in the theater scene this year, and it can also be said to be the greatest achievement of the artist Zhou Xinfang in his decades of theatrical career. "Wen Suchen" has sold out dozens of shows in a row, attracting countless audiences. There is really a saying that "If you haven't seen Wen Suchen, you're not from Shanghai." Even the famous Beijing opera actors who came south one after another rushed to see it. "Wen Suchen" can be regarded as the most popular play this year.</p>
<p>In addition to the above plays, "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Yu Tang Chun" still rely on their age and can still cater to the tastes of Shanghai people. As for the supernatural scenery plays, they don't seem to have as much magic this year as they did last year, so they are gradually being eliminated. It is expected that the supernatural plays will disappear from the Shanghai theater scene in 1940, and the old plays may be revived.</p>
<p>New Movie Introductions</p>
<h3>A Hero of His Age</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"A Hero of His Age" was recently allowed to be publicly screened after some cuts. It is said that it was considered to be overly revealing. Judging from what is now seen on the screen, and based on speculation, perhaps there were exaggerated depictions of confrontations with the military and police. As for the exposure of content, it is precisely what the playwright aimed at in the current deformed society. After being sentenced to fifteen years, Luo Ji eagerly went to see lawyer James upon his release, only to find that James had embezzled his ten thousand yuan in savings. Starting from this hatred, Luo Ji also seized evidence to blackmail James, thereby becoming accomplices. This is an entire social problem, not something Luo Ji's friend Jerry can salvage. However, the playwright, through Jerry, raises the issue of education for homeless children, which I believe is the focus of this film.</p>
<p>Under the vast and bold direction of [Director's Name, assumed to be "寇蒂茲" - Koudiz], the entire film tightly stimulates the audience's heartstrings from beginning to end, without a moment of relaxation. The first part, which introduces the young Luo Ji and Jerry, is also concise and clear. When Luo Ji is released from prison, returns to the slums, and meets Lulu, and when he acts as a referee for a basketball game, the director makes the scene full of fun.</p>
<p>James Cagney's portrayal of Luo Ji, with his agility and casual demeanor, is indeed one of the best performances in all his works. Pan De'aoblin's Jerry, in the scenes where he returns the money to Luo Ji and earnestly pleads with Luo Ji, performs with composure and gratitude.</p>
<p>The six young tycoons all fulfill their duties. The "Wu" girl, An Xiulidan, doesn't have many scenes, but her serious acting is not bad.</p>
