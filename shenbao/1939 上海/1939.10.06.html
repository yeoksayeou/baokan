<h3 id="c12">日本退出反共公約說 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>昨日英國倫敦與義國羅馬電訉，俱稱日本政府宣告退出反共國際公約云，語焉不詳；至昨夜止，東京方面並未發表此項消息。本月二日，即四日之前，日本外相野村在彼地方長官會議中演說外交方針時，首先聲明如决：</p>
<p>「在本年五月之地方長官會議席上，有田外務大臣曾經說明日政府正在揭櫫强化日德義防共協定而與德義兩國折衝中云云；然其後歐局以但澤問題爲中心而有急激變化；至八月二十四日，則德蘇兩國竟成立互不侵犯協定；故上述交涉即爲之終止。」</p>
<p>昨日英義電訉所述，是吾即由野村演說而訛傳。抑日本政府別有宣告之舉措，茲尙無從證實。惟野村聲明者，强化交涉之終止，非毀的也；英義電傳者，等於毀的之宣告退出；二者程度不同，關於反共公的則一。</p>
<p>原所謂反共國際公的，德義主之，日本附之。此在德義兩國，方事摧毀民治而建立國社政權與法西政權之際，以反共云云爲其對內對外政略上之揭櫫；兩國不滿於凡爾賽和約後之局面而共謀有以更張之，於是形成軸心以爲侵略之槓杆；此反共公約之所由來也。日本在遠東發動其侵略，旣知此爲世界民治國家所不直，復以日本國內與其他各國之戒懼於共產主義者，實繁有徒，更以一意孤行於侵略之不能無所結託，遂加入公的。夷考其實；德義除於西班牙援助弗朗哥將軍，對於略有左傾色彩之共和政府，實行武力革命，釀成兩年半之西班牙內戰而外，未嘗有反共之作爲；即在彼國內，國社黨與法西黨之組織儘足排擠異已，拱衛政權，無待於託名反共。至於日本，發動侵略於中國全力勦共之時，加緊侵略於中國共產黨勢窮力蹙之候，非但未嘗有反共之作爲，抑且於客觀之事實上破壞中國之淸共。夫共產主義之是非善惡如何？共產第三國際之國際策略如何？西班牙共和政府中之共產成分如何。政績如何？此其利害得失如何？皆屬另成問題，非可簡單論斷；然德義日本號稱反共而對於共產大本營之蘇聯，始終未敢正視，此則絕無疑問之史實也。是以所謂反共國際公約者，乃德義日本在內政上與國際上佈爲疑陣之工具，本質上絕無價値可言。希特勒雄才偉略，能發能收，故號召反共於始，亦實行結蘇於先；及蘇德聯歡而反共公約亦成灰燼。故在今日之局勢之下，日本對此公的，無論爲主張維持，爲主張强化，或聲明終止强化之交涉，或作退出公的之宣吿，其實相均；要之，均屬絕無意義之事。</p>
<p>我人猶欲論之者，日人無論對於國家大事，對於稗販末業，無不錙銖必較，民族性使然也。故於反共公的之類，世人所視爲廢紙，視爲灰燼者，日人仍不視如無物而藐之，且硜硜焉以爲廢紙猶有廢紙之分量，灰燼猶有灰燼之功利。德國雖已手毀反共公約，日人猶必留不徒留，棄不輕棄，務求盡其用，有可斷言也。抑何所用之乎？曰，用之於對付中國；彼首相阿部嘗謂「日本今日當前之大問題，實爲中國事變之處理，因之不得不將政策之核心，置諸中國事變處理之中，而使內外各項政策，均統合集中於此目的之下，」反共公的之存廢爲彼政策之一端，而一切政策惟以對付中國爲務。抑何以用之乎？曰：中國問題之中有英法，英法怯弱，且有時而近於愚闇；日本猶得以反共公約自外交魔術上，自國際宣傳上，賣弄之於英法人之前；此約雖無復絲毫意義，然欺脅英法則或效，此其一也。中國問題之中有蘇聯，蘇日目前相處之情况，微妙特甚；旣相疑忌，復相周旋，亦最想相利用；反共公約之本質慨屬敵對蘇聯，則日本而公然退出公約，至少亦望於宣吿之前，以取得蘇聯之何種慰藉爲代價，此其二也。日本對華侵略之行動，今已不能藉口於反共，然因企圖使中國爲彼事實上之保護國，即不得不企圖於和平形式之下，駐兵中國，是則夙以防共爲藉口者也；今者一反共公約雖不廢棄，亦已不便復强人參加，是猶待覓致駐兵之他種藉口，以替代反共；於此代用品尙未覓得之時，當不棄公約如敝屣，此其三也。此三者，事實上絕無功效之足云，然日人於此絕無意義之反共公約，無論留之棄之，務求盡其用，行見其必有反證此說之不謬者！</p>

<p>虧弱丈夫秋今進補的必要　免於陷入人生的悲慘境地！</p>
<p>身體是我們的活寳貝。財產·地位·學問·名譽誠然可貴，但不有身體，尙復何有？所以善攝生者發財可以稍遲，做官亦不必急求，如果身體虧弱，則必先進補，待身體健康了，謀求富貴，儘多機會，就是不慕榮利，退修家園，夫婦相親相愛，白首偕老，兒孫滿堂，家庭和樂，亦是何等的幸福！</p>
<p>爲丈夫者身體何以虧弱雖有原因多端，但大都必因早年犯有自　遺精，早婚縱慾或多妻過淫，把生命源泉的生殖腺液消耗枯竭，則凡腦弱失眠，記憶不良，腰酸背痛，早洩陽萎，發育不全，未老先衰諸症叢生，此種病夫，必然畏難退縮，坐失時機；卽得良機，亦因缺之精力應付，感有不能勝任之苦！至於在夫婦生活上，更表現着衰弱無能，或呈曇花一現，或竟完全不能人道，犧牲了妻子的靑春。妻子的性情溫柔者，因此而憂鬱成疾者有之？較爲剛强者，因不耐寂寞而與人私通私奔者有之：公然與夫訴請離婚者，亦是司空見慣！</p>
<p>莫因虧弱而陷入人生的悲慘境地！這是虧弱男子必要進補的唯一要義。今允足言者：自秋令天氣轉凉之後，我們的身體乃發生一種收斂性的自然作用。所謂「秋收冬藏」。所以此時進補亦較易吸收。同時人體紅春夏與初秋的忙勞及溽暑的消耗以後，就是一個健康者此時亦有進補之需要。惟補品雖對於身體有益，但亦不可亂投。若腦弱而服以助消化劑，則不特腦弱依然，而消化的自然能力反見減退。所以進補亦須求其最對症而特效。關於上述的各種虧弱症象。據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。因此劑品質貴重，效力確實，久已口碑載道，而爲任何類似雜脾製劑所不及。並其性質和平，毫無興奮神經及胃腸等副作用，純係積極建設性之補劑。服後能於一日夜間發揮補腦補血，生精健腎，滋養神經等五大功能，繼續服用，更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，必於短期內根治各症。常服更能收益壽延年，返老還童之功，惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」（永安先施西藥都及五洲中西等大藥房均售）以鞏固精關，制止遺洩，則收效允速！</p>
<h3 id="c62">遺精失治將難為丈夫 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>大丈夫頂天立地，奮發有爲，這是每個男子漢所應當的。不過，要做大丈夫須要具備做大丈夫的資格，資格無他，即須有堅強的體格，聰明的頭腦，豐富的精力，然後自能學而不倦，智識與技能均超人一等，遇事　發有為，為友情所稍羨，同時此種男子必為女性理想中的伴侶，在戀愛塲中常可左右逢源，　得如意夫人，婚後生活，自然愛情　　，男育女，是何等的幸福！</p>
<p>可是男子如因年靑無知，或爲惡劣環境所誘，或自甘墮落，犯有自凟惡癖；或醉心於花柳塲中，早年縱慾：或爲陳腐家庭所迫，早婚斵傷；或不知衛生，憂勞過度，病後失調；凡此種種均足以傷害性神經，使精關鬆弛，繼起遺精症，靑年人之遺精本甚普通，如能即行治愈，尙無大害，但若因循失治，那就危險之至！因爲人體內的精液，即所謂生殖腺液，功能助長發育，調整新陳代謝，滋養腦，脊髓，性各部神經，如因遺精縱慾而致精液枯竭者，則凡腦衰健忘，失眠多夢，腰酸背痛，腎萎早洩，發育不全，未老先衰諸症叢生，於是精力疲困，辦事無能，學無進步爲社會所棄！在夫婦生活上，亦必爲妻不滿，家庭間每演出悲劇，這豈非難爲了丈夫？男子而不爲丈夫，將枉此一生！所以自凟縱慾必須嚴戒，患有遺精症，務求速治，治法。。據世界名醫及余經騐均以服「希米脫氏固精片」最爲特效，因服此劑後，卽能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，當晚可收安眠止遺之效，已有上種症象者，則須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎精血及神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期內根治各症，而使身體益臻健康，患者如能來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，兼施電療，注射等新療術，更可保證治愈，</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>健美是女性的第二生命，我們並未言過其實。在道男子中心的社會裏，婦女們雖力求解放，但生理上經濟上所受的束　是無法避免的。不過，女性也有一種天賜的特　的巧妙之處力儘足以籠絡住男子，這就是女性的健美。許多男子爲什麽要拜倒在石榴裙下？多少丈夫的靈魂爲何要給他的嬌妻佔領？師母，太太，少奶奶的權威，爲何要勝過於先生，老爹和少爹？這豈非因爲女性體貌的健美，用著愛情的醇酒，迷醉了男人的身心所致？誠然，一個女郎而生長得身材苗條，乳峯高聳，臀部豐腴，那全身的曲線美就自然的流露出來，同時此種女性卵巢機能必然健全，於是血液充盈，面頰紅潤，當她笑靨迎人的時候，男子們的心怎能不爲所醉呢？所以在情場上必能選得個如意郎君，婚後必能夫婦恩愛，生男育女，家庭美滿，是何等幸福！可是女性而如患經亂白帶，不感不娠與其他暗疾者，卵巢機能必受摧殘，則乳峯即無良好發育，即已發育良好者亦必逐漸萎　下去，臀部亦瘦削，血液虧損，容顏呈慘白或枯黃現象，或更腦衰失眠，腰酸背痛，精神困倦等症象叢生。此種女性，不特不能吸引男子的歡心，在愛情中陷入悲慘之境，或史不能生育，早衰短命！欲謀補救，據世界婦科名醫及余經驗均以服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」最爲特效，因此劑於服後廿四小時內即能調經止帶，根治暗疾。常服更能增進卵巢機能。調整新陳代謝作用，可使乳峯聳起，面頰紅潤，增進健美。</p>

<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我們這一羣是從第一中華職業補習學校無綫電專修科畢業出來的學生，在我們剛剛畢業的時候，由着一位同學某君的告知，說現在內地航空署及交通處（西南公路）機關電台要在上海招考八十多名報務員，待遇每月薪水最低者爲八十元（三等報務員），錄取後到內地去的川資是由機關津貼，第一次考試是在××無綫電專門學校舉行。這是一個多麼好的機會啊！我們都帶着一顆歡躍的心，希望考取後，可以實現我們的願望——爲我們自己的祖國服務工作去！</p>
<p>這是在七月十八日的事：我們到××學校去報名，知道十九日下午六時就要舉行考試了，當時按章規定每人繳報名費二元，照片履歷片各二張，憑着收據，在十九日的一天，這天正是颶風襲滬的一天，雨也落得很大，在狂風暴雨的吹擊裹，我們是跑到××電校去應試，到了後，看見佈吿板上貼着一張佈告謂：主考者係爲××輪船船舶電台之報務員，姓龔名××者，因颶風，輪船未能靠埠，故須延期舉行等字樣；我們便各自回轉，接連着三天，都是白走，我們非常詫異，怎麼國家機關招考人扌是如此的不準考期呢？但是我們認識，認識××電校在上海頗有相當的歷史和校譽，當然是不至於作虛僞的事，而來欺騙我們靑年的。</p>
<p>在二十二日下午六時是舉行了考試，一位主考先生，另外還有着三四位監考先生，一共有三十多人應試。經過了四個多鐘點的時間，完畢了考試，此時這沉重的心是漸漸地减輕了，只期望着揭曉的結果。過了數天，知道我們這幾個人（投函者）是被錄取了。我們是多麽欣慰！我們的希望是要達到目的了！並且吿知我們說，不到二個月時間便須動身赴程。因此各人都凖備自己的行裝，待二月後的今日，投入我們祖國的懷抱中去，爲國效忠服務，那時的我們眞是有說不出的快樂和欣慰！</p>
<p>到現在，考試期是已經過去了二個月。啊！眞是「天有不測風雲，人有剎時禍福」，在前幾天忽然接到了××電校發給每個投考者的油印信，當看完了那信的時候，眞如一聲晴天霹靂，驚動了我們每一個人。那封信上寫着謂：「主考者龔××至今未有啟程日期之通知，今甚且要求再收保證金每名伍元……以如此方法，跡近虛僞，故決定即日起將前所收取之報名費，即行發還……」我們始終猜想不出，怎麽這樣一個頗有地位的無綫電學校竟作此無頭無腦的事？龔某借該校爲考試地點，當然事先是接洽妥當，同時亦是該校信實龔某，認識龔某。我們是信任××電校，我們的報名費是繳納在該校的會計處，並且是在該校中應試，當然××電校是要負責任的。料想不到，現在是這樣的結果，使我們都驚奇不已……唉！爲了這决的機會，我們是尃心等待了二個月的時間，因為知道已是被錄取而將耍派往內地去工作者，所以近來新生，聖路易無綫電學校等公開招考報務員，我們都沒有去應試。那裏知道，到現今××電校始吿知投考者謂，此事係爲虛僞。那末不是又要另覓機會了嗎？然而耍等待到何時扌能有機會呢？我們從學校中畢業出來已經有二個多月了，倘再如目前一樣的一日日下去，我們所學得了的技能不是要漸漸退步而至荒蕪了嗎？靑年時代的光陰是一生中最寳貴的光陰，這樣子的守待在孤島之上，對於偭人不是一筆很重大的損失？文責自負）</p>

<p>— 包</p>
<p>第十六回　謀興醫學造士成庠　思擴村治託兒有所</p>
<p>還有一種惡風俗，借那慶弔的事，作爲貿利歛錢之舉。這在鄉村間還少，却在都市中更多。譽如老太太做　，　壽果然要做，散壽也不肯放鬆。嗣母果然要做，生母更力求然閙。此外伯母，嬸母，以及岳母，寄母，都以供取做壽的材料。也竟有上半年做了壽，下半年又要做壽的。實在老太太或是已經棄養的了，那末陽壽不做還可以做陰壽。到後來那些父母，祖父母的冥誕，也同陽壽一般，可以大發帖子，廣收禮物。其實人已死了，壽於何有，倘然出於追思的誠意，家祭追薦，也都可以的，何必要那種大事排塲，這便可見得醉翁之意不在酒了。後來上海的白相人，甚而至於因爲送帖不送禮，而尋仇報怨，白刃相加，這送禮之事，可以算到了宋途了。因此後來一個反動，社會問關於慶弔，概不送禮。若在要好的親戚朋友，偶爾有所贈餽，那是例外。所贈送之物，或是一種紀念物，或是一種需要品，這種幛子銀盾之類，完全是消耗無用的廢物，當然也絕跡了。連市塲上，這種品物也沒有了。因此這回林建成和金澹雲的結婚，送禮的人也很少。但不能說絕對沒有，要好知己的朋友，也有送他們禮物的，不過隨時可送，也不必擠在這一個辰光。就像她們這幾個姊妹中，朱愛人就未必送她什麽，何氏姊妹是要送的。吳君素姊妹不知怎樣，大約送她一些紀念品。猜想起來蘇理雅太太這一筆禮物，定是最大的了。到了明天星期五的上午八點鐘，朱村長打電話給他的孫女兒了。他說：「昨天開過村議事會，何家兩位小姐織綢廠廠址的事，已經通過的了。不過將來造何等樣的房子？是怎樣的設備？打樣的時候，還要經一度審查。你關照她們兩人！』愛人唯唯答應了，又吿訴他：「下星期不到自由村來，爲的大家要到上海去，吃金澹雲的喜酒。幷且何氏姊妹，得到了她們老太爺的電報，有一位父執，從北邊到上海來，她們也要去拜望他，商量綢廠的事。因爲那一位父執，是現在的股東，而從前也曾開過絲織物廠的，是個內行，應該是請敎他的。』　（一八八）</p>
<h3 id="c92">煤氣燈（機械詩話） <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 如晦</p>
<p>在電燈之前，上海還曾有過「煤氣燈」。</p>
<p>王弢「瀛壖雜誌」（一八七五）卷六云：</p>
<p>西人於衢市中設立燈火，遠近疏密相間，其燈悉以六角玻璃爲之，遙望之燦若明星。後則易之以煤氣，更爲皎潔。蓋藉煤礦之氣，聚而發熖，故光遠而有耀耳。……是可見「煤氣燈」之出現於上海，當在淸同治間，並被目爲「奇蹟」。故當時人創「滬北十景」，竟以上爲十景之一，題爲「夜市燃燈」，且詠之云：</p>
<p>電火千枝鐵管連　最宜舞館與歌筵紫明供奉今休羨　徹夜渾如不夜天那時的上海，是有了幾盞「煤氣燈」，便成爲「不夜城」了。不過，這還不是「誇張」的，慈谿芷汀氏的「洋涇四詠」，把「煤氣燈」的神秘，却更說得如火如荼。詩云：</p>
<p>活火燃千朶　明星烱萬家</p>
<p>樓台春不夜　風月浩無涯</p>
<p>欲奪銀蟾彩　眞開鐵樹花</p>
<p>登高遙縱目　疑散赤城霞</p>
<p>題目呌做「地火」，這是當時很通行的名字。廿三間屋舊主人，也曾塡「望江南」詠之，稱爲：</p>
<p>申江好，地火最光明。漏轉銅龍誇不夜，花開鐵樹照深更，比月更澄淸。</p>
<p>這却寫得較幽靜一點。不過一般作家，則僅視之如月。蘇康侯詩：「勝地無煩秉燭行，圓珠替月倍分明。何須浪擲金錢買，海上天開不夜城。」即是此類。「滬北竹枝同亦曾詠到「地火」：</p>
<p>竿燈千盞路西東　火自能來奪化工</p>
<p>不必焚音誇繼晷　夜行常在月明中</p>
<p>「夜行常在月明中一，確是一種好意境。　末並有按云：「樹竿置燈，所以炤道，皆自來火由地道出，光焰絕明，澈夜不滅。」故當時又有和「煤氣燈」爲「自來火」者。至「地火通宵」，「申浦竹枝詞」亦會說到，謂爲「地火通脊何處無。」其正面題詠一首，則云：</p>
<p>最爲巧妙絕烟氛地火光明面半醺</p>
<p>上下樓合都照澈暗中機括孰能分</p>
<p>後二句甚佳。最怪者則爲「滬城雜詠」作者，對「煤氣燈」竟咒詛之爲「鬼火」，稱「鬼火攢星張亥市」，大概此公是極守舊之流。但大多數作者，却祇有讚歎。直至「電燈」設立，始將其詠「地火」之熱在，轉向「電燈」。然在「電燈」初興，亦即是從「煤氣燈」到「電燈」的過渡期時代，亦有對雙方並加頌讚者，此有南疆雙紅豆館主「上海竹枝詞」爲證：</p>
<p>海市分明不夜天電燈煤電兩爭妍</p>
<p>敎人不識團　月　漫說今宵是上元</p>

<h3 id="c93">兩舞台爭聘中　荀慧生　來滬尚有問題 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>四大名旦之一的荀慧生，自從二十二年來滬出演天蟾舞台後，已有六年之久，不曾南來獻藝。（三年前慧生曾經到過一趟上海，是爲參加張嘯林氏六秩大慶的堂會。）正因爲這一層關係，黃金戲院和更新舞台，都想邀聘荀氏來滬，在這兩家戲院分別派人與慧生接洽之下，荀慧生來滬獻藝的消息，差不多傳送到每一個愛好京劇人們的耳鼓裹。</p>
<p>經過許多波折，在這兩家戲院各不相讓的奔走結果，事實是這樣的吿訴我們。苟慧生將於禹歷九月中南來，兩家戲院的主腦人物，以情感來解決這件難題。——荀慧生先在更新舞台演唱半月，（接吳素秋趙金蓉等人的後隊）演罷冉到黃金演唱一月，（接王玉蓉後隊）不料在更新邀角人昌返滬復命以後，荀慧生突如其來的打電報給更新關係方面的某聞人，他並不承認已與更新邀角人談妥，準時來滬接吳素秋等人的後隊，因此慧生來滬的事情，無形中又生了變化。</p>
<p>聽說慧生和更新方面，是因爲公事沒有談妥，荀慧生完全以認錢不認人的態度，對待更新，想以鉅額包銀的要求，而使更新當局對他放棄；他的意思，是更新放棄後，可以毅然來滬出演黃金，事實上黃金方面，的確在很久以前已正式邀妥慧生。</p>
<p>更新舞台方面和慧生的事件，現在完全在一數之差，更新總經理董兆斌先生的意思，因爲慧生的有意爲難，表示灰心，但聽某聞人的「一句閒話」，如果某聞人的意思是不必再去邀他的話，更新當局，决計放棄荀慧生，而接譚富英譚小培父子提前來滬登台。至於黃金方面呢，因爲以前和慧生談判順利，所以他們對慧生來滬一層，表示很有把握。</p>
<p>戲班的事，往往變化無窮，說不定荀慧生能够仍舊照原定的步驟，和滬人相見，不過此中問題以外，還有個問題，就是王玉蓉的配角小生金仲仁，小丑朱斌仙花臉蔣少奎，都是荀慧生班中人物，如果王玉蓉在慧生之先出演黃金的話，金仲仁等人必要隨玉蓉同來，此事在黃金方面，並無問題，更新方面，則又節外生枝，因爲事實上絕不允許金仲仁等人分趕兩家的戲碼的。</p>
<p>據說荀慧生的辦事人員，以及班底配角，都想南來，慧生自已，也未　不想來滬，不過凡是角兒，都有一個臭脾氣，就是有人請敎他了，他非架子擺得十足不可，我也是愛護慧生的一份子，希望苟老板不要太那個。因爲這决的事，無疑予慧生一個大好機會，要知機會是不常有的，錯過這個機會，恐怕不會再有這樣的好機會哩。</p>
<h3 id="c94">歐戰爆發以後　好萊塢的動向 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>歐洲戰事經過相當時期的醞釀，終於由宣傳戰而進入正式戰了。歐洲發生了戰事，好萊塢這一所世界唯一的影城，雖遠隔重洋，但爲了歐戰，也有若干嚴重的影響。允其是下面幾點，特別顯著。</p>
<p>改變製片方針　歐洲是美片在海外的最大市塲，允其是英國，更是好萊塢出品的大好市塲。因此這一决歐洲戰事，使好萊塢影片的海外市塲，受到嚴重的打擊，特別爲了英國也是主戰的一國。結果使好萊塢的影片公司，對於製片方面，馬上改變政策，凡是以歐洲各國電影觀衆爲中心的影片，都停止拍攝。</p>
<p>影星回國服務　我們回想起來，前决歐洲大戰，好萊塢有不少外籍影星，都回國服務，有的甚至在戰地作戰。所以這一次，歐洲戰事爆發之後，當然也不例外，外籍影星要被徵回國了。像却爾斯鮑育已回法服務，而考爾門這一般人也回到英國去了。如果戰事延長下去，當然還有不少外籍電影從業員，耍相率回國，擔任各種戰時工作爲國效勞哩！</p>
<p>推廣南美市塲　近年來西班牙的戰爭，中日的不宜而戰，在在足使好萊塢减少海外的電影市塲，而這决歐洲的發生戰事，使好萊塢所受的影響更見嚴重。在這種情形之下，好萊塢的影片公司，目光就轉移到南美各國，極力向南美，中美推廣市塲。所以最近我們曾看到不沙故事描寫南美風光的影片，在不斷的公映，這也是好萊塢在歐戰聲中一種變向呢！</p>

<p>— 企業</p>
<p>“Juarez”</p>
<p>「錦繡山河」是叙述十九世紀中葉，墨西哥總統華雷士對抗深入墨境的法軍，雖然大部的城市全吿陷落，雖然傀儡馬克思米林在拿破崙三世策動之下沐冠而猴了，但是華雷士沉着堅定，他拒絕了馬克思米林的中庸主義，他也以正義之火撰滅了副總統烏南迪的叛變，終於，在軍民擁護之下，華雷士收復了墨西哥的錦繡山河。</p>
<p>從這個故事中，它給予我們以下的敎訓：（一）華雷士不屈不撓的抗戰精神。是終於獲得最後之勝利；而勞師遠征，冀遂侵略的野心的法軍，是必然地遭致失敗的。（二）馬克思米林的傀儡登塲，果然是受了巴倫將軍的欺騙，當他發現巴倫要他簽沒收人民財產及私藏軍火者處死的手論時，他還冀希和華雷士「合作」，他沒有澈底地看淸在民族存亡之秋，是祇有絕對的「是」「吾」，沒有中間的路道的。（三）副總統烏南迪的陰謀叛亂，也終於在正義之前覆滅。</p>
<p>這里飾演華雷士的是保羅茂尼，以他洗煉的演技來扮演道歷史上的偉人，他的奕奕如神的眼睛，堅定沉着的舉止，確是令人肅然起敬！飾演馬克思米林的是白拉恩亞亨，他從傀儡登塲起，受騙，妥協，失敗，每一個過程，都能狀出心理矛盾的衝突，絕然不同於「新金山」中的草莽英雄茀雷。蓓蒂黛維絲的馬克思米林妻子卡洛黛，在勸慰丈夫，及見了拿破崙以後的瘋在，都發揮了她底精湛的演技。（未完）</p>

<p>Chongqing: Fierce battles in northern Hunan continue to unfold. In recent days, various Chinese armies have been relentlessly pursuing the defeated Japanese troops, achieving significant victories. Pingjiang County City has been tightly encircled by Chinese forces, preventing the Japanese from breaking out and making its capture imminent. On the railway front, Chinese pursuing troops have pushed the Japanese forces to the north bank of the Miluo River, nearly causing a complete collapse. Currently, with the exception of a few remaining Japanese soldiers in Yingtian who are being swiftly eliminated, there is no trace of the Japanese south of the Miluo River. This large-scale southward invasion by the Japanese was met with a fierce counterattack by the Chinese, who cut them into several sections, encircled, and annihilated them. In total, over 30,000 Japanese soldiers have been killed by the Chinese forces. More than 6,000 bodies were abandoned or could not be moved. The severity of their losses, the speed of their defeat, and their panicked retreat are unprecedented in any previous decisive battle. The valiant Chinese soldiers have achieved unprecedented results, effectively achieving the greatest goal of depleting Japanese forces. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Chinese pursuing troops on the south bank of the Miluo River are advancing rapidly northwards, pressing the majority of Japanese troops to the riverbank. They have made contact with the Japanese in the Xinshichang Lejie area. It is expected that the remaining Japanese troops on the south bank will be cleared out within days. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The war in northern Hunan has returned to the area along the Miluo River. According to reports from the front this afternoon, Chinese mopping-up troops have completely cleared out the remaining Japanese soldiers in Putang (west of Pingjiang), Kaishi (south of Miluo Station), and Gaohuazhong (southeast of Xiangyin), and are advancing on Pingjiang, Changle, Miluo, and Yingtian. Baishui Station on the railway line and Danianqiao south of the station were recovered yesterday. The Japanese retreated towards Yingtian, and Chinese troops at Danianqiao annihilated several hundred Japanese soldiers disguised in civilian clothes. This morning, Chinese troops were mopping up the remaining Japanese soldiers between Pingjiang and Wengjiangpu (west of Pingjiang), and near Xinshi in Changle. The three to four thousand Japanese troops in Pingjiang are almost trapped. Furthermore, two to three thousand Japanese soldiers from Tongcheng reinforced Chongyang last night and launched a counterattack on Chinese-held Maishi, seemingly intending to seize the strongholds of Maishi and Taoshugang to find a retreat route for the trapped Japanese forces in the Pingjiang area. The fighting there is currently intense. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to reliable sources today, the war in northern Hunan has undergone a complete change since the Chinese army launched a full-scale counterattack on October 1st. The area from 20 miles north of Changsha to 60 miles north of Changsha has been completely recovered. In the past five days, the Japanese forces in this area have suffered nearly total destruction. The remaining units, under the strong search of powerful Chinese forces and new troops, have all collapsed and fled north. Among them, the Japanese 33rd Division has been almost completely wiped out. (Fifth Dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Japanese troops in northern Hunan have been fiercely attacked by the Chinese for days and are retreating north in a disorganized manner. The Chinese army is pursuing them in several routes, like a wind sweeping away the remnants. Yesterday, Danianqiao, Baishaqiao, and Wengjiangpu were recovered. The Japanese are extremely chaotic and falling apart. The remaining Japanese soldiers in Yingtian and Xinshi are being mopped up by the Chinese army. A part of the Japanese army entrenched in Pingjiang City has been surrounded by the Chinese army and can be annihilated soon. The Japanese troops in Tongcheng have been ambushed by two Chinese units, suffering more than half casualties. On the 4th, the Japanese army reinforced three to four thousand troops from Chongyang, and fierce fighting is still going on. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, all Chinese newspapers here published the news of the total collapse of the Japanese front line in northern Hunan in large characters, stating that the Japanese 33rd Division had been annihilated after the battle near Pingjiang. Furthermore, it was said that all military strongholds around Changsha had been recovered by the Chinese army, and the Chinese army is now clearing the remaining Japanese soldiers on the south bank of the Miluo River. (Fifth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Changsha: Various units of the Chinese army are now thoroughly mopping up the remaining Japanese troops on both the north and south banks of the Miluo River. There is no trace of the Japanese near Pingjiang. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Gao'an: On the 2nd, the Chinese army in the northeast launched an attack on the Japanese army southwest of Fengxin and engaged in fierce fighting.

The alarm was lifted at half past four this morning, so the residents went back to sleep. However, they were awakened by the alarm again at about ten in the morning, but at this time it was drizzling here, and the Japanese planes left without dropping bombs.

It is said that Wang Kemin wants to retain his position as the leader of the North China government, which in theory is subject to Jingwei's control, but Jingwei fears that Wang Kemin would hold a high position in Nanjing in name only without real power due to conflicts in the Chinese officialdom. It is reported that the seventh "Joint Committee" will be held in Ping in mid-October in an attempt to eliminate differences of opinion. Wang Jingwei will attend in person at that time. At the same time, it is reported that Jingwei is trying to invite Wu Peifu to be the head of the "Pacification Committee" to implement local policies in North China under Wang Jingwei's "new government." Chinese sources claim that if Wu Peifu refuses to take office, then Qi Xieyuan will be invited to assume the post. It is reported that someone is trying to eliminate the conflict between Wang Jingwei and Wang Kemin. (Fifth Dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Military Committee Releases One-Week Battle Situation <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Committee said that the war this week (September 27 to October 4) was the fiercest in northern Hunan. There were also fierce battles on other fronts. Although the Japanese army's invasion was fierce, under the strong resistance of the Chinese, the severity of the Japanese army's losses and the speed of their retreat were unprecedented. Therefore, the success of the Chinese strategy of depleting the Japanese army has been powerfully demonstrated. Regarding the course of operations, the more important ones are described below:</p>
<p>Hunan-Hubei Front: The Japanese troops in the Pingjiang area invaded China in three routes this week. The central route snuck along the railway line to Qiaotouyi, the right wing snuck along the Chang-Yue ancient road to Sanduoqiao south of Qingshan City, and the left wing snuck from the mountainous area on the Chang-Ping border to Jinjing and then turned west to invade and reached Shangshanshi. Another part snuck from Jinjing south to Yong'an City, venturing blindly with extremely fierce momentum. Starting on the 30th, the Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese army's unstable foothold and launched a full-scale counterattack, cutting the Japanese vanguard into several sections in the intricate mountainous areas and defeating them individually. By the 2nd, the central route had captured Qiaotouyi and Liju, the right wing had captured Qingshan City, Sanduoqiao, Wanggongqiao, and Lijia Duan, and the left wing had captured Yong'an City, Shangshanshi, Jinjing, Maishi, Longmen, Zhuxi, and Xianzhong. Chasing the defeated enemy was like splitting bamboo. Within a few days, more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining Japanese soldiers collapsed in a disorganized manner to the north of Pingjiang. At the moment, the Chinese army continues to advance, and the front has been pressed to the Miluo River. The overall war situation is increasingly stable as the remaining Japanese troops are thoroughly mopped up. In recent days, the Hubei Chinese army has launched attacks on various routes, encircling Linxian in the north by way of the Xi River, and capturing Changshoudian, Xiaojia Dian, and outposts around Zhongxiang in central Hubei, as well as encircling Qianjiang, and approaching Xianning and Chongyang in southern Hubei, and capturing a lot wherever they went.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi Front: The Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi, after being badly defeated in the northeast of Gao'an, gathered several thousand remnants and invaded west from Fengxin. In order to induce the Japanese army to penetrate deep, the Chinese army made slight shifts at the positions of Luofang, Yecheng, and Shangfu west of Fengxin. Starting on the evening of the 26th, the Chinese army launched a full-scale counterattack and engaged in a heroic battle with the Japanese army. By the morning of the 27th, Luofang, Yecheng, and Qifu had all been recovered, and then they advanced to encircle Ganfang and severely attacked the remaining Japanese troops. On the 1st, they took advantage of the victory to recapture Huangshaqiao, Hengqiaoshi, and Shiziling, cutting off Japanese reinforcements. The region is estimated to have killed more than 3,000 Japanese soldiers. As for the Japanese troops northwest of Xiushui, after sneaking into Taoshugang, they immediately divided more than 3,000 infantry and cavalry into two routes to invade Bai Shaling in the southeast and Gai Wenling in the southwest, but were severely attacked by the Chinese army and were defeated. Taoshugang has been recovered, and more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers have been killed. The Japanese attempt to coordinate with the invasion of northern Hunan has been completely thwarted. Moreover, the quick-response Japanese army in the northeast of Gao'an successively captured Longshan, Yanziyan, and Nanxi in the southeast of Nanchang, and captured a lot. At the moment, they are continuing to advance and mop up the remaining Japanese troops. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chongqing: In order to encourage national savings and to start national construction undertakings, the central government designated the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to issue savings bonds for national construction. After receiving the order, the bureau actively prepared for it and is now ready. It has ordered the bureau's Chongqing, Kunming, and Guiyang branch offices, and more than 1,000 post offices in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to sell them simultaneously around the Double Ten Festival. In order to promote them smoothly, the director of the Savings Department, Xu Jilian, was specially assigned to lead ten special inspectors from the Remittance Inspection Department, including Zhang Zhongyi, to go to various branch offices to assist in the promotion in order to achieve widespread publicity. Mr. Xu and special commissioners Zhang Zhongyi and Fang Jianbiao arrived in Chongqing by air on the 4th to actively rush to handle the sales and various procedures. Other commissioners will also arrive one after another. It is heard that this savings bond is better and more convenient than ordinary savings. The absorption of funds is limited to running national construction affairs, with the idea of saving to save the country. Both the principal and interest are directly responsible by the post office and are guaranteed by the government, which can be said to be unparalleled in stability. Savings bonds are divided into two types, A and B. Type A bonds are registered and can be reported lost and reissued. Type B bonds are unregistered and cannot be reported lost but can be freely transferred or donated. The denomination is divided into six categories: five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan. The term is stipulated to be a maximum of ten years, but Type A bonds can be applied for redemption at any time after six months at more than 1,000 post offices across the country, which is no different from ordinary current savings, and the interest is far better than current savings. Type B savings bonds must specify the term of storage at the time of purchase, which is divided into ten types from one year to ten years. Once specified, it cannot be changed. Detailed information will be printed in a booklet and issued by the bureau within days. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e12">The Theory of Japan's Withdrawal from the Anti-Comintern Pact <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, news dispatches from London, England, and Rome, Italy, both stated that the Japanese government had announced its withdrawal from the Anti-Comintern International Pact, but the details were not clear. As of last night, Tokyo had not released any news on this matter. On the 2nd of this month, that is, before the 4th, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura, in his speech on diplomatic policy at the local governors' conference, first stated the following:</p>
<p>"At the local governors' conference in May of this year, Foreign Minister Arita once said that the Japanese government was advocating the strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy and was negotiating with Germany and Italy. However, the European situation subsequently underwent rapid changes centered on the Danzig issue. On August 24, Germany and the Soviet Union unexpectedly established a non-aggression pact. Therefore, the aforementioned negotiations were terminated."</p>
<p>The news dispatches from England and Italy yesterday were either a misrepresentation of Nomura's speech or a separate announcement by the Japanese government. It is currently impossible to verify this. However, Nomura's statement was that the strengthening negotiations had ended, not that the agreement had been canceled. The dispatches from England and Italy were equivalent to an announcement of the cancellation of the withdrawal. The two differed in degree, but were consistent with the Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
<p>The so-called Anti-Comintern International Pact was led by Germany and Italy, and Japan was attached to it. At the time when Germany and Italy were destroying democracy and establishing national socialist and fascist regimes, they used anti-communism as a banner for their domestic and foreign political strategies. The two countries were dissatisfied with the situation after the Treaty of Versailles and conspired to change it, thus forming an axis as a lever for aggression. This is where the Anti-Comintern Pact came from. Japan launched its aggression in the Far East, knowing that this was not approved by the world's democratic countries. Moreover, Japan and other countries have many people who are wary of communism. Furthermore, Japan insisted on carrying out aggression in China that could not be without ties, so it joined the Pact. In fact, Germany, in addition to assisting General Franco in Spain and carrying out an armed revolution against the slightly left-leaning Republican government, which led to the two-and-a-half-year Spanish Civil War, has never engaged in anti-communist activities. Even within their own country, the organizations of the National Socialist Party and the Fascist Party are fully capable of crowding out dissidents and protecting the regime, and do not need to claim to be anti-communist. As for Japan, it launched its aggression in China while fully suppressing the communists, and intensified its aggression in China when the Communist Party was exhausted. Not only did it never engage in anti-communist activities, but it also objectively undermined China's efforts to eliminate the communists. What are the rights and wrongs, good and evil, of communism? What is the international strategy of the Communist Third International? What are the communist components in the Spanish Republican government? What is their performance? What are its advantages and disadvantages? These are all separate issues that cannot be simply judged. However, Germany and Japan, which claim to be anti-communist, have never dared to face the Soviet Union, the communist headquarters, which is an unquestionable historical fact. Therefore, the so-called Anti-Comintern International Pact is a tool for Germany and Japan to create suspicion in domestic and international affairs, and has no value in essence. Hitler had great talent and strategy, capable of both launching and withdrawing. Therefore, he called for anti-communism at the beginning and also allied with the Soviet Union first. When the Soviet Union and Germany were allied, the Anti-Comintern Pact also became ashes. Therefore, under the current situation, it is actually the same for Japan to either advocate maintaining the agreement, advocate strengthening it, announce the termination of the strengthening negotiations, or make an announcement of withdrawing from the agreement. In short, they are all completely meaningless things.</p>
<p>What we still want to discuss is that the Japanese are meticulous and cautious about everything, whether it is a national affair or a petty business. This is due to their national character. Therefore, the Japanese still do not regard the Anti-Comintern Pact, which the world regards as waste paper and ashes, as nothing, and stubbornly believe that waste paper still has the weight of waste paper and ashes still have the utility of ashes. Although Germany has already destroyed the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Japanese still insist on not leaving it, not abandoning it lightly, and striving to make the most of it. It can be asserted. What is it used for? It is used to deal with China. Prime Minister Abe once said that "Japan's biggest problem today is the handling of the China Incident. Therefore, we have no choice but to place the core of our policy in the handling of the China Incident and integrate and concentrate all domestic and foreign policies under this goal." The existence or abolition of the Anti-Comintern Pact is one end of its policy, and all policies are designed to deal with China. How is it used? There are Britain and France in the China issue. Britain and France are timid and sometimes close to stupidity. Japan can still use the Anti-Comintern Pact in diplomatic magic and international propaganda to flaunt itself in front of Britain and France. Although this pact has no meaning at all, it may be effective in intimidating Britain and France, which is one of its uses. There is the Soviet Union in the China issue. The current relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan is extremely delicate. They are both suspicious and circumspect, and they both want to use each other. The essence of the Anti-Comintern Pact is to oppose the Soviet Union. Therefore, if Japan publicly withdraws from the pact, it will at least hope to obtain some kind of comfort from the Soviet Union as a price before the announcement, which is the second point. Japan's actions of aggression against China can no longer be justified by anti-communism. However, because it attempts to make China its de facto protectorate, it has no choice but to attempt to station troops in China under the guise of peace. This has always been justified by anti-communism. Now that an Anti-Comintern Pact has not been abolished, it is also inconvenient to force people to participate again. It is still necessary to find other excuses for stationing troops to replace anti-communism. When this substitute has not yet been found, it should not abandon the pact like worn-out shoes, which is the third point. These three points have no practical effect at all. However, the Japanese will try to make the most of this completely meaningless Anti-Comintern Pact, whether they keep it or abandon it. We will soon see that they will definitely reverse this theory and prove that it is not a mistake!</p>
<h3 id="e13">Statement by French Premier Daladier: Britain and France Determined to Collaborate for Ultimate Victory; Will Never Yield to Strong Powers and Accomplished Facts; Unwilling to Accept a Temporary Truce Before the Next Aggression <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Paris: French Premier Daladier stated to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies today that France must continue to fight, expressing that the unity between Britain and France in military, economic, and financial spheres remains close. After British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that Britain and France would never abandon the purpose for which they joined the war, French Premier Daladier also declared to the world that the French government will continue to cooperate faithfully with Britain and will not accept any peace dictated by others. Daladier elaborated on the origins of the war, stating that while the immediate cause of the war was the invasion of Poland, the underlying cause was Germany's ambition to dominate Europe. Daladier continued by stating the aim of France in the war, explaining why France must continue its extremely friendly unity with Britain in this war. Daladier also answered questions from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies in detail, expressing admiration for Italian Premier Mussolini's efforts to prevent the outbreak of war until the last moment, and said that Britain and France had repeatedly tried to resolve various disputes without resorting to war, but Hitler ultimately created the current war situation and must bear full responsibility. It is reported that Daladier mentioned to the committee the efforts of the United States to revise its neutrality law. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: Premier Daladier delivered a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, clearly explaining the government's current policy and reviewing diplomatic activities since the outbreak of the military conflict, stating that Germany has imperialistic goals and intends to control everything. This war was purely caused by that country's blatant attack on Poland, and that country bears all responsibility. Britain and France had previously strived to find a peaceful solution to various disputes between Germany and Poland, and the French government also published a Yellow Book to make all relevant documents public so that all countries around the world could be clear about where the responsibility lies. At this point, the Premier then described the possible consequences of various agreements between Germany and the Soviet Union, and reported in detail on the negotiations between Britain and France with Turkey, as well as France's mutual relations with most countries. He expressed satisfaction with the improvement of relations between France and Japan, and said that as for France's war objectives, they have been repeatedly stated before and need not be repeated. Recently, the bond between Britain and France has become increasingly strong, and both sides are determined not to yield to violence or to accomplished facts. What France hopes for is not a temporary truce between two aggressions, but a lasting peace that ensures the safety of all countries. The Premier then concluded by saying that he firmly believes that Britain and France will be able to achieve ultimate victory no matter what. It is rumored that Germany has sent peace proposals to Britain and France, but this is not true. This speech was deeply praised by the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and people in the lounge of the Chamber of Deputies also expressed great satisfaction, saying that the German propaganda machine has used so-called peace proposals to cause some misunderstandings internationally. "Premier Daladier's resolute speech can dispel these misunderstandings in one fell swoop." (Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">British Foreign Secretary Explains Three Principles of Peace <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>London: The House of Lords debated the war situation today. Lord Snell spoke first, saying that when peace is proposed in the future, we must pay attention to examining whether it is a genuine peace and not a truce that anyone can use to rearm and prepare for further aggression. We unfortunately have no reason to believe that Nazi Germany has slightly changed its mind and purpose. Today's Germany is still yesterday's Germany and is a huge problem for the world. If Nazi Germany wants peace and proposes a republic of peace with a velvet glove on one hand and a loaded pistol in the other, then its psychology is unspeakable. Germany has a brain, but it does not understand why other countries hate Germany. We must be careful when dealing with this matter, because the restoration of the status quo may not be the restoration of peace. We do not want to continue to live under the fear and anxiety that we have had for the past few years. I hope the British government will not refuse to listen to genuine proposals that can restore world peace, but we must pay attention to whether it is a genuine or false peace.</p>
<p>Former Home Secretary Lord Samuel then spoke, saying that if the war ends within a month, everyone will welcome it, but if the end of the war only makes the situation no better than before, but instead worse, and the people are still not free from panic, international treaties are still worthless, and the scourge of war is still a threat, then this truce is too expensive. I believe the people of Britain and France all know that we are now at war and must continue to do so to achieve our original purpose.</p>
<p>Archbishop Lang stated that we cannot have peace with Hitler, but we can conclude an honorable treaty with Germany and the great Germanic people. We should arrange a path for a new organization of European peace, so that our youth have a clear understanding that they are not only eliminating harm to European life, but also preserving civilization for the future.</p>
<p>Lord Cecil, Chairman of the British League of Nations Union, also stated that the rumored peace proposals include the recognition of the conquest of Poland, and if so, such proposals are unacceptable.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Halifax replied on behalf of the government, saying that Britain trusts France very much, just as France trusts Britain very much. Recently, if Britain has made any decisions or announcements, it has always consulted with the French government and exchanged opinions. This has been the case in the past and will continue to be the case in the future. As for the Soviet Union, we are happy to see the maintenance of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey. The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey do not need to conflict with the extremely close relations between Britain and Turkey. As for the possibility of peace proposals, I cannot predict the content of such peace proposals that may be put forward. We have very painful experience of the characteristics and methods of the German government. We have repeatedly seen the German rulers abolish the international treaties they have signed and destroy the basic principles of the policies they have been promoting for many years. Therefore, if the German government now wants to use guarantees instead of threats to satisfy people, then we must say that the guarantees issued by the current German government are insufficient. If we do receive peace proposals, we will study them carefully and test them with the principles for which we are fighting. No matter what the nature of the proposals, they must be considered in the following three aspects: 1. The circumstances under which the peace proposals are put forward; 2. The government that puts forward the peace proposals; 3. The guarantees that any future agreement can obtain. If the circumstances of the proposals are negotiations under the threat of force, then the danger is extreme. Britain and France will never be moved by threats and abandon the principles for which they are fighting. If we abandon violence and pledge to abide by faith, then we are prepared to shake hands with other countries, including Germany, and jointly engage in the work of genuine world construction. We have repeatedly stated our willingness to contribute to achieving this goal, but any progress towards this goal cannot begin until there is a solid guarantee of security and that countries no longer constantly fear German attacks and no longer need large-scale armaments to prevent aggression. Now our first responsibility remains to find conditions that can prevent violent regimes from being used again and that government promises are kept. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Berlin: The German official news agency stated that the German Parliament is scheduled to meet at noon on Friday to listen to Hitler's declaration. It is expected that Hitler will announce his peace terms at that time. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German political figures mostly take a wait-and-see attitude toward the future development of the international situation. Now that the war in Poland has ended, the tense situation has eased slightly. German people are eagerly looking forward to the speech that Head of State Hitler will deliver to the Parliament tomorrow. Since yesterday morning, national flags have been flying all over Germany to celebrate the transfer of German troops from the eastern front to the western front. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>London: The Italian official news agency published an article in Rome confirming the claim from Berlin that Italy has not taken the initiative for peace at the moment. It is said that the news spread by some British newspapers that Mussolini is considering a peace conference plan has no basis. In the current situation, Italy does not want to have an initiative of this nature. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent criticized the matter, saying that informed sources in London attach great importance to this statement. Moreover, the fact that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano did not issue a communiqué after visiting Berlin shows that Mussolini has refused to launch Hitler's peace plan. This point has special significance, because British Prime Minister Chamberlain said on Tuesday that he would study and test any proposals based on the conditions he had previously stipulated. Now that Germany's proposals have obviously failed to meet these conditions, Mussolini is not accepting the responsibility of promoting Germany's proposals. The fact that there was no communiqué after Ciano's visit to Berlin is probably because a communiqué could not be issued until Mussolini approved Germany's proposals. It is rare for there to be no communiqué after such an important official visit. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome: The news that the German Parliament will meet tomorrow is the matter of most interest to Italian political figures at the moment. The Italian government welcomes measures to end the war, but rumors have spread from Britain and France that Italy has already moved to end the war. Semi-official Italian sources deny this, and the general public believes that the time is not yet ripe and it seems too early to take formal action. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: Official circles do not comment on the possibility of the United States participating in a peace conference, as mentioned by former British Prime Minister Lloyd George in the House of Commons yesterday. However, non-official circles say that the United States is unwilling to propose a peace treaty with Italy or other countries that would permanently divide Poland. Secretary of State Hull has previously stated that the US government does not recognize that Poland has been destroyed. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>London: Military and political figures here have focused their attention on the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. It is believed that the Soviet Union is eager to protect itself from the possibility of British naval and air forces attacking and destroying the Baku oil fields via the Black Sea. Therefore, it is now putting pressure on Turkey to lock the Black Sea, but it is believed that Turkey will not disappoint the Allied countries. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Geneva: News has been received here from Paris that French political figures are paying close attention to the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. French political circles believe that these negotiations involve the issue of Turkey recognizing the accomplished facts within Poland.

<p>Moscow: Political figures in Moscow say that the Turkish representative has received instructions from his government to continue negotiations, so the Soviet-Turkish negotiations that were suspended on October 2 can be reopened. Diplomatic circles here are rife with rumors that the Soviet government has proposed the following key points to the Turkish Foreign Minister: (1) Warships of belligerent countries are not allowed to pass through the Dardanelles Strait during wartime; (2) Conclude a Soviet-Turkish mutual assistance treaty; (3) In fact, the Soviet Union will undermine Turkey's relationship with the British-French alliance.

At that time, Foreign Minister Saracoglu will visit Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu in Constanta on his way back to the country for talks. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu, accompanied by the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Yaktai, visited Soviet Defense Commissar Voroshilov yesterday and held a lengthy conversation. Saracoglu then visited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Mikoyan. Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Terentiev also participated. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu's talks in Moscow have been delayed. Although official circles have not criticized it, the public has become greatly uneasy. Newspapers authorized by the government vaguely state that even the slightest sacrifice that harms Turkey's sovereignty and honor cannot be recognized. This is Turkey's task. According to reliable sources, but not confirmed by official circles, the Soviet Union has requested to sign mutual assistance treaties with the Balkan and Black Sea countries, which are the same as those being negotiated by the Soviet Union with the Baltic countries. Another message said that the Soviet Union had informed Saracoglu that the Soviet Union must establish naval bases in Romania's Constanta port and maintain the right to transport troops through the Balkan Peninsula countries. It is heard that among the important events discussed by Saracoglu in the Soviet capital, in addition to the events that are directly related to Soviet-Turkish relations, there are also those that affect the Balkan Consultative Countries, allowing them to be the issue of Romania. Although the true nature of these discussions is still very vague, Turkish newspapers are fiercely criticizing the rumors that the Balkan Peninsula countries are abandoning their neutral status and tending towards democratic countries. Diplomatic circles hinted that Moscow is putting pressure on Saracoglu, but said that no matter what happens, Turkey's position and its promises to Britain and France will not be affected.

<p>Yugoslav Capital: The German economic delegation has been here for some time negotiating a commercial agreement with the Yugoslav government. The German side intends to order various raw materials and requests immediate delivery, but is unwilling to pay for the goods in cash, only promising to exchange them for military equipment and various machines "as soon as possible." This has not been accepted by the Yugoslav government, and current negotiations have encountered difficulties. The plenary meeting originally scheduled for the two delegations to be held within days has been postponed indefinitely. In addition, it is heard that the British Commercial Counselor has met with the Yugoslav Minister of Commerce, Drais, to inform him that his country is willing to purchase grain and raw materials from Yugoslavia. For this reason, the Yugoslav government's attitude towards Germany has become tougher. Germany fears that after the negotiations break down, Yugoslavia will contact Britain, and also because the Soviet Union may provide various raw materials under more favorable conditions, it is not eager to conclude an agreement with Yugoslavia. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris: Well-informed sources here recently said that since the Soviet Union is putting pressure on the Baltic coastal countries and Germany is putting pressure on the Scandinavian Peninsula countries, there is a possibility that these countries may be forced to become war zones in a short period of time. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, according to information obtained from Rome, the Soviet government has concentrated 600 aircraft and 20 army divisions in the Kunlun area on the border with Latvia. In addition, in accordance with the mutual assistance treaty it signed with Estonia, the Soviet government originally intended to send troops to strategic locations in that country, but it sent troops before that country ratified the treaty. On the other hand, the Soviet Union also made demands on Finland for certain privileges for certain ports in that country. Judging from this, the Soviet Union intends to maintain strategic bases on the Baltic coast, and the more the better. As far as Germany is concerned, it is heard that the German government has sent a strongly worded note to the Norwegian government, demanding that it supply the country with certain goods, otherwise it will send aircraft to bomb it. The threatening methods it has taken against neutral countries can be seen from this. Regarding this, people in Sweden expect that Germany and the Soviet Union will soon force the Scandinavian Peninsula countries to stop trading with Britain and France and instead sell various goods to Germany and the Soviet Union. (Germany needs a part of the pig iron supplied from the Scandinavian Peninsula countries). These countries are extremely uneasy about this. However, responsible officials in Paris still said that Germany and the Soviet Union's strategies are bound to fail. (Havas, 5th)</p>

Twenty-eight crew members of the Greek steamship "Taimantis," which was sunk by a German submarine, who escaped danger were landed last night by the submarine at Ventley Bay in Kent County. It is reported that five members of the local militia witnessed the submarine submerging into the sea, but were unable to detain it. The rescued individuals were confined to the submarine for 36 hours. It is said that the Germans treated them well. Six of them require hospital treatment, but their conditions are not severe. (4th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London. Responsible sources here claim that in the past week, only 836 tons of British ships have been sunk by the Germans. The German claim that a British merchant ship rammed a German submarine is entirely unfounded. They also deny that the British authorities have used submarines in the current conflict. (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London. A German ship of 8,000 tons, which was loading iron ore in Luleå, Sweden, recently entered a minefield near the island of Borkum in the East Frisian Islands of German territory in the North Sea. It is reported that it struck a mine and sank. The fate of the crew is unknown. However, the Germans have now seized the Estonian ship "Järni" to compensate for this loss. According to a Gothenburg, Sweden, newspaper, the "Järni" was carrying lumber to Antwerp, Belgium, when it was seized near Visby by a German destroyer and taken to a German port. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Danzig, a large coal ship flying the Finnish flag was seen aground on the outer beach of Jäschke Island yesterday, refusing assistance, giving the impression that it was a German ship and that there may be detained crew members on board.

<p>Copenhagen, Denmark. Cannon fire was heard yesterday off the western coast of Denmark. It is generally believed that this was due to a naval battle near the German island of Heligoland. (5th, Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden. After repeated violations of territorial waters by German submarines, the Swedish government has decided to form a fleet to patrol the coast. This fleet includes one battleship, two destroyers, two submarines, and several smaller warships. The naval authorities have also borrowed one hundred merchant ships from various shipping companies, equipped them with weapons, and ordered them to assist in searching within territorial waters. (5th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, Denmark. The "National Daily" here recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that several Danish ships detained by the Germans will be released after confiscating the cargo they carry. German officials also confirmed that if the British contraband list is not revised, Germany will launch an "economic war" with all its strength, regardless of the impact on neutral countries. (5th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin. Political figures here, commenting on Germany's intensification of economic warfare against Britain, stated that Germany's adoption of this measure was not proactive, but was forced as a response. Germany is willing to engage in fair warfare. Germany's chivalrous conduct in the first month after the outbreak of the war can prove this, and the statements of neutral observers can also be cited as sufficient evidence. The new action by the British Admiralty to arm merchant ships is an extreme violation of the laws of maritime warfare in international law. Merely arming merchant ships cannot be regarded as converting them into warships, but the direct order from the British Admiralty to attack German warships has blurred the distinction between combatant and non-combatant. Therefore, Germany has a need to intensify economic warfare. (5th, Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>London. The Information Department recently issued a communiqué stating that in the week from the 23rd to the 30th of last month, a total of 33,000 tons of various contraband goods destined for Germany were intercepted by British warships.

As for German aircraft, they have not yet conducted reconnaissance flights within our country. (4th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London. Military critics here are gradually adopting the view that the German army will take the road through the Netherlands to attack. The news that the German army is actively reinforcing the Siegfried Line opposite Belgium shows that they want to protect their left flank in this attack.

(5th, Havas)</p>
<p>Paris. After the cabinet held a State Council meeting yesterday morning, the government gazette published an order today stipulating that the Parliament should be adjourned immediately. Political figures commented on this, saying that this move is extremely important. Although the government dissolved the Communist Party on the 26th of last month, the privileges enjoyed by the party's members of Parliament are still valid. According to the Constitution, this privilege is limited to the parliamentary session. Once the session ends, it will immediately lose its effect. Now that the Parliament has been adjourned, the privileges enjoyed by the deputies will be automatically canceled, and the government can punish them in accordance with ordinary laws when necessary. The authorities have also, at the request of the military authorities, begun investigating the activities of the party's deputies. If the deputies are found to have formed a new party under a false name, they will be brought to justice. However, the temporary adjournment of Parliament does not stop its activities, and the government can still convene it at any time, which should be in the second half of November. The full powers enjoyed by the government will then expire, and the Parliament will have to be asked to re-pass the Full Powers Act. (5th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo. After the Cabinet decided to establish a Ministry of Trade to absorb the Commercial Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a bizarre situation has occurred in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Matsushima, the Director of the Commercial Affairs Bureau, angrily resigned yesterday morning, saying that if the ship does not listen to the captain, then the captain can only leave the ship. As a result, the six section chiefs and several junior officials of the Commercial Affairs Bureau also resigned one after another. Then, 150 senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting to discuss this situation for a long time, and finally decided to ask Foreign Minister Nomura to attend the meeting at 5:15 p.m. yesterday to question him, criticizing him for betraying his faith in supporting the establishment of the Ministry of Trade and demanding his resignation. However, Nomura's attitude was firm and he did not accept the request, saying that implementing national policy is to prioritize the unity of the cabinet. The staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs then requested that important political and economic diplomacy should be unified under the control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and passed a resolution stating that all directors and secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are united and firmly opposed to the main points of the establishment of the Ministry of Trade. The government now believes that this turmoil is an internal matter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again convened a meeting today to consider protesting to Prime Minister Abe. (5th, Reuters News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. All section chiefs and administrative officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting in the conference room at 8 p.m. on the 4th, advocating opposition to the establishment of the Ministry of Trade. It was resolved that each department and bureau should elect one section chief representative and one administrative official representative to form an executive committee to carry out the opposition movement, and the meeting would not disperse until the goal was achieved. After the meeting, the following declaration was issued: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not opposed to the establishment of the Ministry of Trade. For the sake of completing the current general mobilization system, it originally advocated the establishment of a strong industrial trade ministry or economic ministry that included the production and distribution sectors. However, now that diplomacy is not unified - political diplomacy and economic diplomacy - but implements a unified diplomacy, it is absolutely impossible to deal with the difficult international situation. Therefore, we firmly oppose the Ministry of Trade directly participating in diplomatic work, and firmly believe that the organic union of political diplomacy and economic diplomacy can realize the development of overseas trade. Thus, an attempt was made to establish a powerful industrial trade ministry to strengthen a unified diplomacy externally, and to unify trade, production, distribution and other sectors internally to promote Japan's economic development. However, the main points of the establishment of the Ministry of Trade decided by the Cabinet this time not only failed to thoroughly include the production and distribution sectors, but also recognized that the Ministry of Trade could directly issue orders and direct affairs to overseas commercial officials and consuls general. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has always advocated the unification of diplomacy, so all section chiefs and administrative officials must unanimously oppose the main points of the establishment of the Ministry of Trade decided this time. (5th, Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The preparatory committee for the Ministry of Trade decided by the cabinet meeting on the 3rd held its first meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 2 p.m. on the 5th. Chairman Karasawa and the various committee members attended. First, they discussed and reviewed the order and other administrative matters, and then proceeded with substantive deliberations. In addition, the new Ministry of Trade decided to transfer some of the affairs of the Commerce and Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Matsushima, the Director of the Commerce Bureau, submitted his resignation based on his position. Also, other foreign affairs officials opposed the new Ministry of Trade's organization. However, the government seems determined to implement it according to the established policy. Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Nomura will also express their determination at the regular Councilors' meeting on the 5th, hoping to realize it in accordance with the cabinet decision.

<p>Tokyo. The reports from Berlin and Rome that Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura has announced his withdrawal from the Anti-Comintern Pact are unfounded. It is believed here that Germany and Italy are obviously spreading rumors based on Nomura's speech at the National Local Governors' Conference on October 2. Japanese sources claim that the Foreign Minister did not mention the Anti-Comintern Pact in his speech that day, but only said that negotiations to strengthen the tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact would be suspended due to the development of the European situation.

<h3 id="e34">Xinhua Daily News Comments; British Warships Withdraw <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing. The CCP organ Xinhua Daily News commented today on the British naval authorities' withdrawal of five out of ten British gunboats from the Yangtze River between Shanghai and Hankou, saying that this decision may have a major significance for the future development of the Far East. Therefore, the Chinese must carefully consider this matter. Given the outbreak of the European War, the withdrawal of British gunboats is naturally expected. What the Chinese should pay attention to is not the withdrawal of the gunboats themselves, but the gradual withdrawal of British power from the Far East and the subsequent changes in British Far East policy. Britain has huge interests in the Far East, but since the outbreak of the European War, these interests have been under very strong pressure, and therefore it has compromised with Japan in the hope of protecting its interests. However, history has proven the repeated errors of British Far East policy. The Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1894 helped Japan defeat China, and as a result, Japan, a second-rate country, became a first-rate country in the Far East. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 resulted in Japan defeating old Russia. Although the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was abolished due to American opposition, its spirit has occupied an important part in British Far East policy from the Mukden Incident in 1931 to the present. Japan is determined to eliminate the interests of third countries in China. Britain is well aware of this, but since the Mukden Incident, Britain has consistently adopted a policy of compromise with Japan. It can now be frankly said that if one believes that Britain is helping China to resist Japanese aggression, it is more accurate to say that Britain hopes that Japanese aggression in China will end within a certain limit. For many years, the British government's efforts have been largely devoted to this goal. China is indeed unfortunate, but Britain is also unfortunate, and its rights and prestige have become sacrifices of this policy. British rulers do not want a strong and independent China. The talk about reopening Anglo-Japanese talks clearly indicates the path that events will follow. We now want to warn Britain that Japan's policy of expelling third countries' rights in China will never change. No matter what kind of compromise Britain makes, it will not affect China's determination to continue resisting Japan. Furthermore, Britain and Japan cannot solve the problem of the Far East alone. At the same time, we hope that the British people will prevent their government from casting the same mistakes it made in Europe, and we hope that the Chinese people will pay attention to the international conspiracy currently underway in the Far East.

<p>Chongqing. The US gunboat "Tutuila," docked in Chongqing, was struck by a ferryboat in heavy fog yesterday. It is expected to be repaired in the city within a few weeks. The ferryboat was swept away by the rapids of the Yangtze River and collided with the "Tutuila," creating a hole four feet wide and nearly ten feet high in the hull. There were no casualties. However, two people on the ferryboat were knocked overboard and were quickly rescued by nearby sailboats. Sailors on the gunboat immediately began pumping water. Fortunately, an engineer who previously worked at the Shanghai company that built the ship is now in Chongqing.

<h3 id="e37">News from Northern Jiangsu: Fierce Fighting in Guanyun's Yangji for Five Days and Nights; Chinese Troops in Xuzhou Approaching the Suburbs; Japanese Invasion of Huai'an Foiled; Puppet Troops in Yangzhou Under Japanese Surveillance <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: In recent days, there have been repeated clashes between Chinese and Japanese troops in various counties in northern Jiangsu. A summary follows:</p>
<p>Guanyun: On the night of September 18th, the Guanyun Regular Brigade fiercely attacked the Japanese troops in Yangji. The next day, when they attacked the fort, platoon leader Zhang Tongfeng and more than 20 soldiers heroically sacrificed themselves in a mine explosion. Nine Japanese soldiers were killed or captured alive. The remaining Japanese troops continued to resist from a blockhouse. After five days and nights of stalemate, the entire town of Yangji was reduced to scorched earth. On the 22nd, three Japanese planes escorted approximately 200 Japanese soldiers to reinforce Xiangshuikou, Xinpu, Banpu, and Dayishan. Except for the Japanese troops at Dayishan, who were blocked by Chinese troops, the rest had entered Yangji fort and attempted to cut off the Chinese troops' retreat. On the 23rd and 24th, Japanese planes bombed the Chinese troops in shifts, forcing the Chinese troops to retreat to their original positions.</p>
<p>Haizhou: Japanese planes have been unusually active in Haizhou recently. On the 21st, they dropped three or four bombs at Zhangjiadian and Longrong. On the 22nd, they dropped three or four bombs at Xiaoyao. They dropped more than 20 bombs near Tongxingji Longwokou, and more than 10 bombs in Xin'an Town. On the 24th, they dropped more than 10 bombs near Yangji and five or six bombs near Tanggou Tangjian. Despite the activity of Japanese planes, the morale of the Chinese soldiers and civilians remains extremely high.</p>
<p>Ganyu: After the Ganyu Chinese Army Regular Brigade occupied Ganyu County, they captured a significant amount of Japanese light and heavy weaponry. When they subsequently attacked Huandunbu, the Japanese troops suffered heavy losses. However, they failed to firmly occupy Shahe Town due to the arrival of Japanese reinforcements.</p>
<p>Xuzhou: In the Xuzhou area, there have been frequent clashes between Chinese and Japanese troops recently. Fierce fighting occurred on the 17th and 20th, with four Japanese soldiers killed and more wounded. Therefore, Japanese troops are heavily stationed inside and outside the city and around the railway station to prevent Chinese troops from launching a surprise attack. However, the Chinese troops are distributed in various villages, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Furthermore, a unit of the Chinese Army's general brigade arrived near Xuzhou to monitor the movements of the Japanese troops and launch a counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Huai'an: The Japanese troops in Huai'an have been scheming to invade the south, but have not succeeded. At approximately 8:00 AM on September 24th, a combined Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery force of more than 200 men advanced towards Huafangtou, Handong, and Shazhuang. They first bombarded the area with heavy artillery, followed by machine-gun fire. The Chinese troops also bravely resisted. However, the Japanese troops resorted to inhumane tactics, releasing tear gas. To avoid the gas, the Chinese troops quickly retreated. As a result, the two locations were occupied by the Japanese troops. At 8:00 PM, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a large-scale counter-offensive while the Japanese troops were still consolidating their positions. The Chinese troops, with high morale, attacked from multiple directions. The Japanese troops, caught off guard, retreated into the city. Huafangtou and Shazhuang were recaptured by the Chinese troops. On the same day, the Japanese troops in Huai'an dispatched another unit of approximately 100 Japanese and puppet troops, with two small artillery pieces and four light and heavy machine guns, to Huangtu Bridge outside the east gate. After fierce resistance from the local self-defense forces, the Japanese troops used their superior firepower to launch a fierce attack and forcibly occupied the area, destroying more than a dozen civilian houses in retaliation. However, they were ambushed by Chinese troops and retreated back into the city.</p>
<p>Funing: On September 19th, Japanese troops in Funing dispatched more than 40 Japanese and puppet troops, with many light and heavy machine guns, to attack the Chinese troops' position at Xiaozhaoguan. They came into contact with the headquarters of the Chinese Regular Brigade stationed there. The Chinese troops resisted using fortified defenses, preventing the Japanese troops from succeeding, and forcing them to retreat back into the city. In this battle, one Japanese officer was killed. It is also reported that the Japanese troops in Funing are currently building 30 two-section boats, each section capable of being carried by two people. Their intentions are unclear.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: The Japanese troops in Xishan, having been ambushed by Chinese guerrilla units, are feeling uneasy. On the 22nd, 50 to 60 Japanese troops from Yangzhou reinforced Xishan, but the next morning, they returned to Yangzhou in the same two trucks. In addition, approximately 200 Japanese and puppet troops are stationed at Xiannvmiao. Puppet troops are stationed as sentries, seven or eight at each location, at Touerdiao Bridge and Sanyuan Bridge Jiangjia Bridge. Japanese troops also send out sentries to monitor the puppet troops. Furthermore, a Japanese shallow-water warship is patrolling the Xian Shao River to protect bridges and waterways and prevent sabotage by Chinese troops.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Jianghua Troops Requested to Launch Night Attack; Japanese and Puppets Defending County Seat <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Jingjiang Correspondence: Jingjiang is a small county in northern Jiangsu. Since being occupied by the Japanese and puppets, the city, which is only three miles in circumference, and the eighteen miles from the city to the Jiangbian of Bawai Port have been placed under their control. The other townships attached to the city are still under Chinese control. A small unit of Chinese troops attacked a puppet police station outside the west gate late at night. In the darkness, the two sides exchanged fire, resulting in casualties on both sides. Puppet Inspector Ni was also injured. Chinese mobile units often use various opportunities in the countryside to ambush Japanese and puppet troops, making it difficult for the Japanese and puppet troops to track them down. Therefore, they are only able to defend the small city and are unable to do anything else. Recently, a traitor named Cai Dekui was captured in Baiyi Town. He was shot for being a Japanese electrician. The Japanese and puppet troops, fearing the Chinese troops, have issued county resident certificates to all residents in the city and have organized them into baojia (a system of household registration and control). New residents whose names are not on the register are not allowed to receive certificates and are accused of being anti-Japanese elements. Therefore, the population of the city has not increased. Most residents live in the Huangju and Wumawei areas.</p>

<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Yangshuyuan, Wuxi, is near Taihu Lake. When the Chinese troops retreated westward the year before last, many people sought refuge there, regarding it as an isolated paradise. This spring, Qian Junshi, the district chief of the Tenth District, cooperated with the guerrillas to maintain order. Last month, it was suddenly reported that the Japanese military police from the urban area had sent more than 20 Japanese soldiers to the town to keep an eye on the guerrillas. To avoid sacrificing the town, the guerrillas did not take action. The Japanese troops soon retreated. On the afternoon of September 30th, more than 20 Japanese soldiers arrived in a boat at Caishentang, four or five miles from the town. Suddenly, there was intense gunfire from both sides of the river. The boatman was shot dead, and the boat capsized. At that time, more than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed, two were captured, and one escaped in the chaos and returned to the city to report. On the night of the 30th, a large force of Japanese and puppet troops arrived and surrounded Yangshuyuan, demanding the surrender of the perpetrators and the bodies of the Japanese soldiers. Qian Junshi led his troops to resist. The Japanese troops set fire to the town. Qian Junshi bravely took the lead and died after being shot several times. Later, Chinese reinforcements arrived and drove back the Japanese and puppet troops. However, before retreating, the Japanese and puppet troops took several townspeople with them. The town was burned down, and the town hall and the new altar were destroyed. The losses were immeasurable. Later, Chinese guerrillas extinguished the fire and collected Qian Junshi's body. The townspeople expressed their respect for Qian Junshi, who died with great spirit. However, all the residents of the town evacuated after hearing the alarm.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Fujian Province Expands Winter Cultivation Campaign; Implements Grain Management Measures in Various Counties <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, Fujian Province has promoted winter cultivation to increase agricultural production and achieve self-sufficiency in food during wartime. However, the winter cultivation campaign in the sixth year was rushed due to time constraints, and publicity and guidance were not widespread. Therefore, the planting area of winter crops was only more than 2 million mu. By the seventh year, the winter cultivation area had increased to more than 3.2 million mu. This year's winter cultivation period is approaching again. The provincial government has decided to further expand the campaign. The Provincial Agricultural Improvement Bureau has drafted a plan, divided into two steps: publicity and implementation. In terms of publicity, in addition to using various oral and written methods and various occasions, they will also use the universal National Monthly Meeting and wartime civil schools to lecture on winter cultivation issues to achieve greater results. In terms of implementation, in addition to mobilizing all farmers in the province to work hard in winter cultivation, they will also promote the participation of rural women, who account for half of the population. For winter cultivation loans, the Cooperation Affairs Administration under the Construction Department will coordinate the handling and has obtained the consent of the Provincial Bank to increase the loan amount. According to the wartime situation, the counties in the province are divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A includes 16 coastal counties such as Wenhou, Type B includes 9 counties such as Shouning, and Type C includes 13 counties such as Nanping. This classification method is designed to concentrate grain production in the rear to avoid losses during the outbreak of war. The loan recipients are loyal farmers with farming ability, heads of households, with fixed addresses and cultivated land, whether they are members of the cooperative or not, can apply for loans. Cooperative members' loans are handled according to the credit loan method. Non-member loans should gather five to thirty people to form a cooperative winter cultivation group, which is introduced by the cooperative or guaranteed by a reliable guarantor. The interest rate on these loans is very low, and the repayment period is limited to six months. The amount that each person can borrow is three yuan in Type A counties, five yuan in Type B counties, and ten yuan in Type C counties. The selection of crops and the purchase of seeds will be properly guided by various cooperative instructors, and a seed committee will be organized to be responsible for handling them. The results of winter cultivation will be reported by the supervisory committees of each county, according to the cultivated area, location, crop type, and quantity filled in the loan contract, and reported to the Cooperation Bureau for record. The responsibility for agricultural technical guidance and loan collection will be handled by the Cooperation Affairs Bureau, assisted by the Agricultural Improvement Office and the county governments.</p>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Government recently implemented grain management to ensure food self-sufficiency and prevent unscrupulous merchants from smuggling, hoarding, and speculating. According to the method, each county uniformly organizes a grain management committee. Before the early and late rice harvest each year, the local baojia chiefs will conduct a comprehensive survey of the number of mu of rice planted by the owners and farmers in the bao, and estimate their harvest, filling out a form and reporting it to the district office, which will report it to the county grain management committee for verification. The owner's family should report the actual harvest quantity to the local baojia chief within one week after the harvest, filling out a form and reporting it to the district office, which will forward it to the county grain management committee. The owner's family should also report the quantity of remaining rice in addition to the necessary consumption for the whole family to the baojia chief in charge, who will forward it to the district office, which will report it to the county grain management committee for record. If they want to sell it, they should report to the grain management committee, which will coordinate the sale according to the market price and must not sell it themselves. If the number of rice harvested by the owner's family is underreported or falsely reported, and they intend to hoard and speculate, hindering people's food supply, once discovered or reported, in addition to confiscating the underreported or falsely reported portion, they will be given appropriate punishment. If the baojia chief assists in concealing it, or takes the opportunity to engage in favoritism and fraud, they will also be punished according to law. The grain management committees of each county may also conduct surveys of the local grain situation and formulate wholesale and retail prices of rice and other grains on a weekly basis, submit them to the meeting for evaluation, and then present them to the local主管 government for announcement.</p>

<p>The Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the large increase in expenses required for the various schools established by the Council, held two meetings on the 15th and 29th of last month to consider the issue of increasing tuition fees. It was found that the educational expenses required this year were expected to exceed the amount stated in the budget by 340,000 national currency. If the current situation continues unchanged, the financial situation next year will be even more unfavorable. The summary of income and expenditure of the various Council-run schools is listed below:</p>
<p>Western Children's Schools</p>
<p>Tuition Income Expenditure</p>
<p>1938</p>
<p>195,555 yuan 741,845 yuan</p>
<p>1939 (Estimated)</p>
<p>910,677 yuan 994,757 yuan</p>

<p>1940 (Estimated)</p>
<p>303,000 yuan 1,052,000 yuan</p>
<p>According to the above figures, the expenditure of each Western children's school next year will increase by 43.7% compared with last year, and the income will increase by 13%. The expenditure of each Chinese children's school next year will increase by 38.5% compared with last year, and the income will increase by 11.6%. The increase in expenditure of Western children's schools is greater, so the increase in tuition fees should also be greater. As for the method of increasing fees, it is appropriate to collect a certain percentage of surcharges. After detailed discussion by the Education Committee, it was resolved to request the Board of Directors to approve an increase in tuition fees for all Western children's schools by 25% from November 1st of this year, and for all Chinese children's schools by 15% from the spring of next year. The total surcharge can collect one million yuan per year. The above recommendations have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council at its regular meeting on the 4th of this month.</p>

It is reported that the first batch of 210 people who have passed the review will be approved for distribution. They will be issued borrowing study certificates and given travel expenses to the school to which they are assigned, and they are required to report to the assigned school by a specified date.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Finance   Exporters Dumping Foreign Exchange in the Market, Immediately Recovers After Tightening <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: listed exchange rates did not fluctuate. The under-the-table market for British and American currencies stabilized slightly as various rumors in the market gradually dissipated. However, trading started soft in the morning due to weak selling interest from foreign banks. Subsequently, the Bank of England (on behalf of a certain group) absorbed heavily, and the Yokohama Specie Bank also followed suit. Although foreign telegrams from Hong Kong and exporters were mutually supplying and dumping, positions were still difficult to allocate, causing the British pound to continue to tighten to 4 shillings and 3.75 pence, and the US dollar to also soften to 7.375 yuan. Later, as telegrams from Hong Kong and exporters continued to show strong selling interest, and the British merchant Sassoon also came to dump, the Bank of America (arbitrage on rupees) also had an oversupply, so the situation gradually recovered. The evening close for the British pound was still 4 shillings and a half, and the US dollar was 7.5625 yuan. The trend for this month's futures was similar to the spot market, and trading was brisk throughout the day.</p>
<p>Heavy Absorption by Favorable Bank</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London cable indicated that near-term futures were down by 3.75 pence, and far-term futures were down by 4.375 pence. The New York silver price fell by 0.125. London raw gold remained unchanged. Exchange rates: British pound against US dollar and French franc were flat, against Shanghai down by 0.040625. US dollar against British pound up by 2.5 fen, against Shanghai down by 0.15 yuan, against French franc up by 0.875. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence for the British pound and 7.4375 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was slightly tighter by 0.03125, while the US dollar was softer by 0.125, due to the increase in exchange rates. After opening, the Bank of England suddenly came to absorb heavily, and the Yokohama Specie Bank also absorbed slightly. Although foreign telegrams from Hong Kong and exporters came to supply, the foreign banks' supply interest was not smooth, resulting in a continued tightening situation. It is estimated that the Bank of England settled foreign telegrams, exporters, and current British pound from banks at 4 shillings and 4.375 pence and 3.75 pence. Subsequently, it absorbed current US dollars from Hong Kong telegrams and foreign banks from 7.46875 yuan, softening to 3.75 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was revealed to be a small 0.5 fen. Afterwards, Hong Kong telegrams and exporters continued to dump, and the British merchant Sassoon also began to sell, so the situation turned strong. It is estimated that Sassoon, Hong Kong telegrams, and exporters successively dumped current British pounds to HSBC, Chase, and a certain foreign bank at 4 shillings and 4.375 pence and a half penny, and current US dollars from 7.5 yuan up to 6.25 yuan. Near noon, transactions decreased, causing the situation to suddenly become calm. Extended to the noon close, the bank's current selling prices were 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence for the British pound and 7.5 yuan for the US dollar, compared to the morning opening, the British pound was flat and the US dollar recovered by 0.0625.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Turns Stable</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, as exporters resumed selling and HSBC's appetite weakened, the market continued to recover. It is estimated that exporters sold current British pounds to Favorable Bank at 4 shillings and a half penny, and sold current US dollars to foreign banks at 7.5625 yuan and 5.9375 yuan. Extended to the evening close, the bank's current selling prices were 4 shillings and a half penny for the British pound and 7.5625 yuan for the US dollar. This month's British pound was 4 shillings and 4.375 pence, and the US dollar was 7.4375 yuan. As a result, compared to the day before yesterday, the current British and American exchange rates were neither up nor down.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Softens</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 5th Telegram: The exchange market was stable this morning. The British pound was unchanged, still opening at 1 shilling and 3 pence and 1 shilling and 9.6875 pence.

<h3 id="e50">Various Anxieties Dissipated: Gold Market Mediocre <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold under-the-table market, started high and then weakened, the trend hovering, but the daily fluctuations were slightly mediocre, the high and low difference only 50 yuan.  Because the previous day's unfounded rumors greatly subsided, in the early morning, a certain gold firm had a strong bullish mentality, relentlessly absorbing through heavy selling.  And foreign exchange tightened and softened, sellers watched and waited. The morning opened up to 4,080 yuan, then rose to a peak of 4,100 yuan because buying wind was still strong.  Subsequently, silver houses sold to jewelers, and securities firms dumped successively.  Furthermore, because foreign exchange changed from tight to soft, although a certain money exchange business still had an appetite, it was ultimately difficult to match. It once fell back to a low of 4,050 yuan. At noon, a certain gold firm resumed buying wind, raising it back to 4,085 yuan. The noon close was slightly weak at 4,077 yuan.  In the early afternoon, it was still flat.  After entering the afternoon, because the floating bulls of the day closed out, coupled with the continued recovery of foreign exchange, it fell to a closing price of 4,055 yuan, a small decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous day. Total transactions were slightly lighter than the previous day, about a thousand taels.  Silver jewelry remained unchanged throughout the day, and customs gold etc. remained consistently stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Without Large Fluctuations</p>
<p>Since early opening, due to tight and soft foreign exchange, people's minds were firmly bullish, a certain gold firm urgently purchased on behalf of speculators, coupled with a lack of sellers at the time, the market opened high by 22 yuan. A certain gold firm acquired ten taels from the money exchange business at a price of 4,080 yuan. After opening, a certain gold firm's absorption was still strong, raising it by 20 yuan. The securities firm acquired twenty taels of gold at 4,100 yuan. At the time, silver houses frequently sold short, and gold firms no longer had an appetite, the market went downward. Soon after, it fell back by 30 yuan. A certain gold firm sold twenty taels to the money exchange business for 4,070 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business bought on behalf of a client, and once rose again to 4,080 yuan. However, because foreign exchange changed from tight to soft, selling wind was strong again, securities firms and money exchange businesses etc. rushed to dump. Although certain two money exchange firms successively modified for customers, the position still felt generous, and immediately fell by 30 yuan. The securities firm sold ten taels to the money exchange business for 4,050 yuan. Thereafter, a certain gold firm resumed buying wind, and retail investors also took advantage of the low to absorb, and the situation immediately became firm, raising it by 35 yuan. A certain gold firm acquired thirty taels from the silver house at 4,085 yuan. The noon close was slightly lower, the money exchange business sold ten taels to the gold firm for 4,070 yuan. Then, a certain gold firm again acquired ten taels each from the silver house and peers for 4,077 yuan, as the noon closing price. The early afternoon opened slightly weak, making it smaller by 7 yuan, the money exchange business sold to the gold firm on two for 4,070 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm continued to absorb, recovering by 5 yuan, a certain gold firm acquired thirty taels from peers for 4,075 yuan. After entering the afternoon, foreign exchange became strong, and retail bulls closed out, coupled with a certain gold firm's appetite turning idle, it gradually retreated, and soon after it fell by 20 yuan. The money exchange businesses mutually transacted twenty taels for 4,055 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 3 yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that after closing, the money exchange business sold short twenty taels to a certain silver house on behalf of clients, at a price of 4,050 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 50 yuan. The selling price of the current gold firm's own gold brand was 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and transactions were few.</p>
<p>Jewelry Unchanged Throughout the Day</p>
<p>Jewelry silver shops exchanged out per tael. Because spot gold did not fluctuate greatly, it did not change throughout the day.</p>
<p>Da Tong Hang still hung 410 yuan, and the new merchants’ prices were the same as above. The purchase prices were to be reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies All Unstable</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currencies fluctuated constantly with the exchange market, so they also fluctuated accordingly. For example, the US dollar bill initially rose to about 14 yuan, then retreated to 13.5 yuan, and finally to 13.6 yuan, a slight decrease of 5 fen. In addition, the British gold bill continued to rise by 0.5 yuan, the British pound also rose by 0.5 yuan, the American pound rose by 1 yuan, the Hong Kong bill rose by 5 fen, and the Japanese gold bill rose sharply, finally rising to 1.1385 yuan, an increase of 0.025 yuan. The demand for Korean bills was relatively rare, and as a result, it only rose slightly by 0.5 li. The other currencies were still stable.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Small Denomination Notes Difficult to Exchange <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank of China issued small denomination notes in Shanghai, it has been generally believed that it can alleviate the pain of small transactions. Since the start of issuance on the 29th of last month, it has been more than a week, but the small denomination notes circulating in the market are still extremely rare. Peddlers and various shops still use substitute vouchers and tram tickets for small change, and because the acceptance of these types of vouchers is frequent, they are tattered and often cause disputes. The small ones not only lose convenience, but also increase the burden on life, and the large ones are related to the entire national monetary system. This is because the Central Bank does not set up exchange offices, so most shops and residents have nowhere to exchange them, and unified industry exchange makes them a rare commodity. One yuan notes can only be exchanged for 9 jiao, and recently some yuan can be exchanged for 9 jiao and 5 fen. It is said that the amount is too small and cannot meet the needs of the entire Shanghai, like a cart of firewood for a cup of water. Therefore, for the benefit of the majority, the Central Bank should increase the amount of issuance and entrust various banks and money shops to exchange them, so as to avoid congestion and benefit the people. This is the responsibility of those who regulate finance. (Sea)</p>
<h3 id="e52">Securities: Bond Market Firm and Stable; Bulls Still Adding Positions <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The under-the-table securities market situation yesterday was generally still hovering, but people's minds were extremely firm and bullish, and the market situation was quite firm and stable. Major bulls were only adding positions and not releasing them. The date for the lottery for Type C bonds was set for the 9th, and there were more buyers than sellers. It has been set for a long time that Type C bonds are above 6 yuan and Type E bonds are above 5 yuan. Whenever there is good news, it is easy to rise, and whenever there is bad news, it is only stagnant. And trading is extremely lively when rising, and it becomes quiet when falling, which shows the stability of people's minds. Since the interest rate for arbitrage of foreign exchange is weak, a considerable part has become wary of foreign banks due to the European war, and the target has shifted to the bond market. The capital is naturally strong, so the future trend should be easy to rise and difficult to fall. The process yesterday was first up and then down in the morning, and first stable and then firm in the afternoon. The momentum of buyers and sellers was dominated by buyers. As a result, except for Type C bonds which were unchanged, the rest were slightly better by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan, and 96 bonds were also better by 0.15 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Shares Transaction: The Bank of China was transacted for 50 shares at a price of 53 yuan.</p>
<p>The Public Association of Industries also reported that yesterday's stock market was firm and stable in the morning, and turned hardened in the afternoon due to the new account's debut. Economic agents competed to buy various well-known speculative stocks, and Huidefeng and Rui Rong shares were given special treatment. The stocks of various holding companies (that is, those that invest in various stocks of other companies as one of the company's businesses), such as Shanghai Silver Company, Yangtze Silver Company, and International Trust Company, were also very active. Steel shares and China Reclamation shares also rose sharply. In fact, the prices of each share, except for rubber shares which were slightly neglected, were almost all involved in yesterday's rise. The market seems to have no room for both industrial shares and rubber shares at the same time. This is why interest sometimes pays attention to the former and neglects the latter, and sometimes turns to the latter, but neglects the former.</p>
<p>London, 4th Telegram: The listed prices of stocks of various Far Eastern British companies today still opened for Shanghai Waterworks and several others. The market was stable. Only Gula Keling Rubber shares fell back by 9 pence, to 15 shillings and 6 pence.</p>
<p>London, 4th Telegram: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts today still opened for China-France American dollars and four others. The market was stable and unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Yarn and Cotton: Floating Longs Exit the Market, Yarn Market Turns Down; 10 Count Yarn Still Able to Support <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market, which had suddenly seen an increase after the closing of the previous day, turned downwards because the rumors were unfounded and people's hearts were stable. At the same time, the actual demand of customer shops showed no sign of improvement. Therefore, the market atmosphere turned downwards, and the general floating longs, in view of the above situation, felt that the overall trend was difficult to reverse, and came out one after another. The market price changed from strong to weak. However, the hand-weaving industry in the inland Jiangzhe area has recently switched to purchasing Chinese yarn due to the high price of Japanese yarn, and the demand for cone yarn is also strong. 10-count coarse yarn can still support one step of the yarn market because the weather is getting colder and it is used to make flannel. Otherwise, the falling wind would be even more severe.</p>
<p>At the opening of the current yarn market in the morning, the remaining power of the previous day was continued, and the general customers cried out loudly, and the bargaining price was very expensive. The price of Shuangma stack increased by 10 yuan, to 740 yuan, and several packages were transacted. Only Shuangma spot goods, the customer shop had no purchasing volume, and the asking price was 766 yuan, but it was held for a long time and failed to be transacted. The rumor of the previous day has now collapsed without attack. Speculators sold short more times, and in a short while, it fell by 10 yuan, the price of the stack was 730 yuan, and the spot price was 752 yuan. The closing price was still weak. As a result, 1,365 packages were transacted in half a day. The market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 10 yuan, Tiannv fell by 5 yuan, Shuangdiqiu fell by 1 yuan, and coarse yarn was also weak. The factory opened 400 packages of 20-count Jinhu cone yarn from Xinsheng Factory at a price of 770 yuan. It was found that 2,045 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Dajin yesterday, and 20 pieces were shipped to Yantai. The amount of purchases from various customer shops is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Peers 740, Inland 510</p>
<p>Xiamen 10 Yunnan 5</p>
<p>Hong Kong 50 Jiangxi 20</p>
<p>Statistics 1,6</p>
<h3 id="e54">Manufacturers Watch and Wait: Cotton Prices Still Not Loosened <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton transaction is quiet. Chinese and foreign manufacturers are increasingly hesitant about raw material procurement due to the rising yarn prices. Therefore, transactions have greatly decreased, and peers are also in a peaceful state. However, there is still no hope of a surge in arrivals, so the selling price is difficult to excessively fall. However, the price of Indian cotton has greatly fallen, and the foreign exchange is tending to loosen. Although the calculation is not very smooth, it is much cheaper than the previous price. Japanese factories may have purchasing plans. If the purchases are implemented, Chinese cotton may be affected, and it is still unknown. The source of northern Jiangsu, Tonghua, is only 940 packages. Panzi Zhu has done business, and the current cotton has only reached a compromise with the peers. 120 packages of Taicang flower were priced at 154 yuan.</p>
<p>Another news: The foreign cotton transaction in the Shanghai port has been very dull recently. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude. The foreign exchange was very calm yesterday. Although the factory's inventory of cotton is not very abundant, it is currently unwilling to take the risk of purchasing, fearing the recurrence of unfounded rumors and the sharp increase in foreign exchange. There have been many arrivals in Tongzhou recently, and the selling price of Bailuo District has a non-negligible impact.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was very quiet but very firm in the early morning. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reported declines, so the market was not active. Later, because of the strong short selling in the south, cotton prices slightly recovered at the close. As a result, they were mixed. The near-term fell by 4 pounds, and the far-term rose by 4 pounds. India Data Tong predicted a drop of 2 rupees, Egypt rose by more than 20 pounds, and Liverpool fell by 8 pence.</p>

<p>Flour: Yesterday, the downward trend was frequent, because both local and customer sales were flat. Although the north and south shops took on purchasing, the transactions were sporadic. The local street sales, because the factory disk still needs 7 yuan, it is difficult to purchase smoothly. In addition, the Japanese flour sellers were full, and the floating shorts were dumped. The Phoenix brand in October only sold for 6.5 yuan. The stack goods of the local factory were also subject to strict urging from the factory, and the incident of Fuxin factory collecting loss fees has not yet been changed. Therefore, the market is still unsustainable, and the price has fallen by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. It is heard that the red and blue car and Fuxin brands have opened at 6.7 to 6.8 yuan. 36,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin yesterday, and 1,000 bags were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the source of wheat was not much, and the production prices in various places have not been relaxed. The sellers are also unwilling to easily sell off. However, the factories need less raw materials because the flour market is not active, and the traders are only paying attention to second-class goods because the prices are too high. Tongshi Shan Fuxin factory purchased more than 1,000 packages of wheat from Changxi Suyou, priced at 9.86 yuan, and the traders purchased more than 10 cars of wheat from Sukun Guantian, priced at 109.33 yuan. The market is slightly firm.</p>
<h3 id="e56">New Early Rice Fell Sharply: Sharpness Has Entered the 20 Yuan Mark <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Since the new goods from various districts arrived in large quantities, the prices have fallen every day. Yesterday, the falling wind was even more intense. The new goods from Changzhou, Sukun Fengjia and other places continued to arrive in 5,600 packages, and at the same time, the new goods from Changxi Songjiang Nangang and other places have already been harvested and should be on the market. However, due to transportation problems, they have not been seen in the market. Therefore, the people in the industry have been watching and not purchasing. Yesterday, people's minds became more and more discouraged. All the customer traders once again asked for a price reduction to sell off. Local customers also changed their attitude and would not purchase unless it was cheap. The market continued to fall all the way until the close and was not stabilized. As a result, the prices of each were reduced by 12 yuan. The new early rice fell sharply, and the giant was pouring down 34 yuan. Yanglu was devalued by about 1 yuan. The sharp points of each customer also fell by 12 yuan. The second-grade sharp points have entered the 20 yuan mark. The Chang broken opened at 41 yuan, the middle at 38 yuan, the Xi broken at 40 yuan, and the middle second at 378 yuan. The Su Tong was at 367 yuan, the new early rice was at 35 yuan, the Changzhou new early rice was at 378 yuan, and the Fengjing hundred was at 334 yuan. The new Yang tip was particularly priced at 26 yuan, the high was at 25.5 yuan, and the second was at 24.5 yuan. The Lu tip was at 27.3 yuan to 27 yuan. The Jiangbei tip was at 21 yuan, the second was at 20 yuan, the broken tip was at 20 yuan to 19.5 yuan, and the Bian Yuan was at 33 yuan. More than 5,000 packages were transacted in the Tongshi.</p>
<p>Another News: In the midst of the arrival of rice from the customer market, the situation has gradually declined. Yesterday, after the new early rice and new early rice fell by 356 yuan, the market for customer rice was even more difficult to sustain. Although the low prices attracted inquiries, the storage was more than enough to meet demand, and the Wushan Japanese also put out a large number of rice. Yesterday, the high-end meter had already fallen into the 20 yuan mark, and the second-grade Wushan and Jiangbei rice were all less than 20 yuan. Brown rice was also only 189 yuan, which was less than 1 yuan than the previous market.</p>

<p>Yesterday's soybean oil market, under the sudden and intermittent source, most people's minds were generally good, causing its selling plate to show a new peak. However, the actual sales of various shops were delayed, and only the local street was handling it. Although the market continued to rise by 0.45 yuan yesterday, its potential was quite strong. A total of 30 barrels of Kobe oil were transacted. The price was listed in the foreign market price column. 50 pieces of Yanshi oil, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, and 50 pieces of Qingxi oil.

<p>The Necessity of Tonifying Weak Husbands in Autumn to Avoid Falling into Life's Tragic Situation!</p>
<p>The body is our living treasure. Wealth, status, knowledge, and reputation are certainly valuable, but without a body, what is there? Therefore, those who are good at cultivating life can be slightly slower to get rich and need not rush to become officials. If the body is weak, it is essential to tonify it first. Once the body is healthy, there will be many opportunities to seek wealth and honor. Even if one does not seek glory and retreats to their home, being a loving and affectionate couple, growing old together, having many children and grandchildren, and a harmonious family, what happiness that is!</p>
<p>There are many reasons why a husband's body becomes weak, but it is mostly due to early self-abuse, seminal emission, early marriage with excessive indulgence, or multiple wives and excessive lewdness, which exhausts the reproductive gland fluid, the source of life. This leads to brain weakness, insomnia, poor memory, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, premature aging, and various other symptoms. Such sick husbands will inevitably shrink back from difficulties and miss opportunities. Even if they get good opportunities, they will feel unable to cope due to a lack of energy! In marital life, they will be weak and incompetent, either appearing briefly like a flash in the pan or completely unable to perform sexually, sacrificing their wives' youth. Some wives with gentle temperaments become depressed and ill as a result, while stronger ones may have affairs or elope due to loneliness. It is common to see wives openly suing their husbands for divorce!</p>
<p>Do not fall into life's tragic situation because of weakness! This is the only essential meaning of why weak men need tonification. I now say this with certainty: After the weather turns cooler in autumn, our bodies undergo a natural astringent action. This is called "autumn harvest and winter storage." Therefore, it is easier to absorb tonics at this time. Also, after the labor of spring, summer, and early autumn, as well as the consumption of the hot summer, even a healthy person needs tonification at this time. However, although tonics are beneficial to the body, they should not be taken randomly. If one has brain weakness and takes digestive aids, not only will the brain weakness remain, but the natural ability to digest will also decrease. Therefore, tonification must be targeted and effective. Regarding the various weakness symptoms mentioned above, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Reproductin," a preparation made from the reproductive gland extracts of strong animals, is the most effective and targeted. Because this preparation is valuable in quality and effective, it has long been highly praised and is unmatched by any similar mixed spleen preparations. Moreover, it is peaceful in nature, without any side effects such as exciting the nerves or stomach, and is purely a positive and constructive tonic. After taking it, it can exert five major functions within one day and night: nourishing the brain and blood, producing essence and strengthening the kidneys, and nourishing the nerves. Continued use can also promote development and adjust metabolism, and it will surely cure various symptoms in a short period of time. Regular use can also benefit longevity and rejuvenation. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Hemet's Semen Consolidating Tablets" (available at Wing On, Sincere, Western drugstores, and Wuzhou Chinese and Western drugstores) to consolidate the seminal gate and stop leakage, so that the effect will be quick!</p>
<h3 id="e62">Untreated Seminal Emission Will Make It Difficult to Be a Husband <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>A great man stands upright, strives for progress, and makes achievements. This is what every man should do. However, to be a great man, one must have the qualifications to be a great man. The qualification is nothing other than having a strong physique, a smart mind, and abundant energy. Only then can one learn tirelessly, with knowledge and skills surpassing others. Encountering opportunities and striving to make achievements will be envied by friends. At the same time, such men must be ideal partners for women, often finding favor in love and marrying a satisfactory wife. After marriage, life will naturally be filled with love, and having sons and daughters will bring immense happiness!</p>
<p>However, if a man, due to youthful ignorance or being tempted by a bad environment, or willingly falling into depravity, commits the bad habit of self-abuse; or is infatuated with brothels and indulges in early years; or is forced by an outdated family to marry early and damage his body; or does not know hygiene, worries and overworks, and becomes imbalanced after illness; all of these are enough to damage the sexual nerves, loosen the seminal gate, and lead to seminal emission. Seminal emission is common among young people, and if it can be cured immediately, there is no significant harm. But if it is delayed and untreated, it will be extremely dangerous! Because the semen in the human body, the so-called reproductive gland fluid, functions to promote development, adjust metabolism, and nourish the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves. If the semen is exhausted due to seminal emission and indulgence, then brain decay, forgetfulness, insomnia, dreams, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, premature aging, and various other symptoms will arise. As a result, energy will be exhausted, work will be ineffective, learning will not progress, and one will be abandoned by society! In marital life, one will inevitably be dissatisfied with his wife, and tragedies will be staged in the family. Wouldn't this make it difficult to be a husband? If a man cannot be a husband, his life will be in vain! Therefore, self-abuse and indulgence must be strictly prohibited. If you have seminal emission, seek treatment quickly. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Hemet's Semen Consolidating Tablets" is the most effective. After taking this preparation, it can immediately consolidate the seminal gate and calm the nerves, achieving the effect of sleep and stopping seminal emission that night. Those who already have the above symptoms must also take "Reproductin," a preparation made from reproductive gland extracts, to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves. Continued use will surely cure various symptoms in a short period of time and make the body healthier. If patients can come to my clinic for diagnosis by expert doctors and receive new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3 id="e63">The Sorrow of the Large-Breasted Girl <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Chongjing, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Beauty and health are a woman's second life, and we have not overstated the truth. In a male-dominated society, although women strive for liberation, the constraints imposed by physiology and economics are unavoidable. However, women also have a divinely bestowed and ingenious ability to captivate men, and that is feminine beauty and health. Why do so many men bow down at the pomegranate skirt? Why do so many husbands' souls get occupied by their beloved wives? Why does the authority of the teacher's wife, wife, and young mistress surpass that of the teacher, old man, and young master? Isn't this because the beauty and health of women's bodies and appearances, using the mellow wine of love, intoxicate the minds and bodies of men? Indeed, a woman who grows up with a slender figure, high breasts, and full hips naturally exudes the beauty of curves. At the same time, such women's ovarian function must be sound, so their blood is full and their cheeks are rosy. When she smiles and welcomes people, how can men's hearts not be intoxicated by her? Therefore, she will surely be able to choose a satisfactory husband in the love field, and after marriage, the couple will be loving, have sons and daughters, and the family will be happy! However, if a woman suffers from menstrual irregularities, leukorrhea, infertility, or other hidden diseases, her ovarian function will be destroyed, so her breasts will not develop well, or those that have developed well will gradually atrophy. Her hips will also be thin, her blood will be deficient, and her complexion will be pale or sallow. Even more, brain decay, insomnia, back pain, mental fatigue, and other symptoms will arise. Such women cannot attract men's hearts, fall into a tragic situation in love, or even be infertile, age prematurely, and die young! To seek remedy, according to world-renowned gynecologists and my experience, taking "Reproductin" for women, an ovarian preparation, is the most effective. This preparation can regulate menstruation, stop leukorrhea, and cure hidden diseases within 24 hours after taking it. Regular use can also enhance ovarian function and adjust metabolism, which can make the breasts erect, the cheeks rosy, and enhance beauty and health.</p>

<h3 id="e64">British Ambassador Leaves Shanghai for Chongqing, This Trip Is To Contact Chinese Authorities and Will Meet Chiang Kai-shek Regularly <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Since Germany and the Soviet Union advanced into Poland one after another, the European situation has changed unpredictably. The British government has repeatedly clarified its policies and attitudes towards the current situation in Europe through Prime Minister Chamberlain. At the same time, the British government has repeatedly stated that the European situation does not affect Britain's past policies towards the Far East and that it will continue to support China's economic relations. British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr visited Chongqing last time to meet with the central authorities and Chiang Kai-shek and Foreign Minister Wang. He returned to Shanghai via Gulangyu on May 29 after completing his official duties. After staying for three months, due to many changes in the situation in Europe and Asia, he left Shanghai and set off for Chongqing yesterday morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pre-departure Remarks</p>
<p>Ambassador Clark Kerr boarded the British Changxing Company's Empress of Russia at 1:00 yesterday morning and set off for Hong Kong. British diplomatic officials in Shanghai all went to the pier to see him off. The ambassador traveled with a simple entourage and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong in seven days. He plans to transfer to a British warship and transfer to Haiphong, and take a plane to Chongqing. The ambassador's itinerary this time is simpler than the previous decision to drive to the mainland by car. When the ambassador was about to leave, the reporter went to visit him. He said in a very natural and leisurely manner that this trip was only a routine visit to the Chinese government authorities, because he had the mission of an envoy and had to contact the Chinese authorities frequently. However, the general public believes that at a time when the situation in Europe and Asia is very turbulent, the ambassador's trip seems to have something noteworthy. According to another source, after the ambassador arrives in Chongqing, he will have discussions with US Ambassador to China Johnson, who is currently staying in Chongqing. The location of his meeting with Chiang Kai-shek will be determined at that time. The ambassador will stay in Chongqing for one month before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Truth About the Stalled Negotiations on the Western Shanghai Issue: The Issue of Police Power Seems Easier to Resolve, The Pseudo-Regime Is Determined to Interfere With the Collection of Taxes <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a certain official of the concession told reporters that the intrusion of pseudo-police into the road construction area outside the boundary, the unauthorized deployment of outposts and patrols, and the directing of traffic can no longer be regarded as temporary matters. As for mutual negotiations to seek a solution to the situation, judging from the current state of affairs, it was originally expected that the parties concerned could find a satisfactory solution within one or two months. However, the negotiations have now reached a stalemate. The focus of negotiations between the Municipal Council and the pseudo-municipal government is on re-allocating the area and powers of the road construction area in the Western District outside the boundary. These direct negotiations are being conducted by Municipal Council President Philip and pseudo-Mayor Fu Xiaoan. They have met several times. The last meeting was two weeks ago. At this time, due to the issues of taxes and police power, there were significant differences in opinion between the two parties, and the negotiations could not continue. It is believed that the difficulties in the issue of police power are easier to resolve, while the issue of taxes is clearly a major obstacle in the negotiations, and these two issues are also related, making it impossible to seek a separate solution. In addition, the issue of adjusting the defense areas, which is currently being discussed by the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai, also involves the municipal rights and interests of the road construction area outside the boundary in the Western District, so the solution is even more complicated.</p>
<p>No New Developments in the Situation in Recent Days</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that Municipal Council President Philip told reporters this morning (5th) that the Municipal Council is currently working hard on the recent developments involving the police authorities on the road outside the boundary. The reporter asked if the Municipal Council and the Dadao Municipal Government would continue to hold negotiations. Philip said that there have been no new developments since he met with "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan in early September. As for the incident in the beginning of this week when several Dadao policemen intruded into the Municipal Council's property, broke into the Municipal Council's Western Children's Girls' School on Yu Yuan Road, and wandered around the school's property, the Municipal Council is "carefully watching" it.</p>
<p>The Briton Gray Was Detained Midway</p>
<p>The "Continental News" reported that a British person named Gray, 39 years old, residing at 934 Jing'an Temple Road, was intercepted and detained by the "Dadao" traffic police, who occupied the powers of the Municipal Council Police Department on the roads outside the boundary in the Western District, at the corner of Difeng Road and Jing'an Temple Road at about 6:00 pm yesterday (4th). After being detained for two hours, he was released. Gray is the first foreigner to have a serious dispute with the "Dadao" police. The incident occurred when Gray was driving a car along Jing'an Temple Road. A "Dadao" traffic policeman stationed at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Difeng Road suddenly ordered Gray to stop and asked to see his driving permit. Gray refused. It is said that Gray told the pseudo-police, "I only follow the rules of the Municipal Council on this road." This statement seemed to have angered the policeman, who immediately summoned 40 "Dadao" policemen, most of whom were armed with rifles, and surrounded Gray's car, ordering him to stay inside the car. However, two women were allowed to leave the car. It is said that the debate was quite fierce afterward. A few minutes later, police officers arrived at the scene to mediate, and a lot of talking was done. The dispute ended at about 8:00 pm, and the "Dadao" police allowed Gray to return to his residence.</p>
<p>Car Passengers Suddenly Searched</p>
<p>The "Zi Lin News" reported that just after 9:00 am yesterday (4th), a public bus drove to Yu Yuan Road, almost directly opposite the entrance of Zhaofeng Park. Suddenly, two Chinese passengers were taken off the bus by the police of the "Special Municipal Government" of Shanghai and searched. The public bus was allowed to continue driving. A few minutes later, the two Chinese were also allowed to leave.</p>

<p>In view of the urgent military needs of other regions, the British government has decided to withdraw five of the ten British gunboats on the Yangtze River. The announcement has been officially released by the British Embassy here. According to the Shanghai-based British gunboats, there are five ships: Scorpion, Dragonfly, Grasshopper, Aphid, and Ladybug. After being ordered, the above five ships have all made preparations for withdrawal. Among them, in addition to the Dragonfly and Grasshopper, which sailed away on the 3rd, the other three ships, Ladybug, Aphid, and Scorpion, have been learned by the reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency that they will be withdrawn on the morning of the 11th. As for the destination of the withdrawal, the Tokyo telecast of the Hai Tong News Agency on the 5th reported that the recall of British gunboats in the Yangtze River has been confirmed here. When the Navy Department spokesman met with foreign reporters today, he made a statement, claiming that Japan hopes that Britain will withdraw all ships from China's territorial waters. Japan believes that the time has not yet come to restore navigation on the Yangtze River, because there are still fierce battles in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, allowing the Hunan area to restore navigation, which is still dangerous.</p>

<p>The "Continental News" reported that yesterday (4th), a ship with seriously wounded Japanese soldiers, about 600 people, was transported from Hankou to Shanghai by the Japanese transport ship Kishumari (transliteration) on Tuesday. The arrival of the wounded soldiers coincided with the news from the responsible parties that there were fierce battles around Hankou and that the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. According to news from foreigners in Hankou a few days ago, the Japanese airfield in the area was heavily bombed by Chinese aircraft.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in addition to raising funds to assist various charitable organizations in handling accommodation and relief, it also pays attention to post-disaster matters such as evacuation, relocation, employment placement, and production work. According to Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Secretary-General of the Association, the number of refugees registered for employment by the Employment Placement Group from February to the end of September in various accommodation centers is as follows: 319 female workers in yarn factories, 48 coppersmiths, 37 chefs, 55 printing workers, 43 teachers, 31 clerks, 23 female workers in sock factories, 53 machinists, 20 painters, 7 embroiderers, 31 workers in silk factories, 114 workers in tobacco factories, 46 weavers, 71 workers in rubber galoshes factories, 3 electrical engineers, 14 silk weavers, 20 carpenters, 29 tailors, 21 plasterers, and other skilled and unskilled workers, totaling 2,257 people. 468 people have been directly placed by the group, including 163 female workers in yarn factories, 30 female workers in porcelain factories, and others who have taken on other jobs. The number of refugees who have been indirectly employed with the assistance of various accommodation centers is not included. The association also provides subsidies to refugees during their apprenticeship, to show compassion and reduce the burden on employers. It is still hoped that all sectors will give priority to employing refugees when they need labor, turning division of profits into production, and transforming passive charity into active relief. Replacing relief with work and benefiting the people is certainly not a small matter. Please contact Mr. Li Wenjie, Director of the Employment Placement Group, and Mr. Li Baiqiang, Deputy Director, at 12669 at any time for consultation.</p>

<p>American shipping companies are still trying to navigate through the ports that have been blockaded in order to maintain their shipping rights. Recently, the British ship Xin Anli, represented by the American company Wiley Hann &amp; Co., and the British company Yilong's Shen Guanglun, have both made trial voyages to Xinghua, Fujian Province, and berthed at Sanjiangkou. According to the reporter of Da Guang News Agency, the Shen Guang and Xin Anli ships have completed loading in Xinghua and returned to Shanghai one after another at about 6:00 pm the day before yesterday (4th). It is said that when leaving Fujian, they were inspected by Japanese warships, but the situation was still relatively smooth. Whether they will sail again in the future is unknown. According to the reporter of Da Tong News Agency, the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line's Wileigh Hann company's New Anner has arrived in Shanghai last night, and Hua Lun Foreign Company's Dapu wheel has been postponed for another day and is scheduled to open on the 6th. However, due to insufficient loading, it will be delayed for another day. The Yi Hua Foreign Company's Baoli wheel is still scheduled to open on the 7th, and the Li He Foreign Company's Mou Fu wheel is currently unloading goods in Zhen, and it will return to Shanghai around the Double Tenth Festival.</p>

<p>The Briton J. Ward is a football star for the French Football Club in this port. He lives at 23, Lane 1984, Jing'an Temple Road. His left neighbor is the New Royal Hotel opened by an Italian. The hotel used to be located on Hongkou Bazilu, but it moved to its current location when the war started. At about 9:00 pm yesterday, while Mr. Walter was relaxing at home, he suddenly heard a knock. The servant was sent to open the door, and several pseudo-"police" officers entered the house proudly, claiming that they needed to talk to the owner. Mr. Walter then got up and questioned them. According to the pseudo-"police," they said they were asking if a person named "Wang" (transliteration) lived in the house. Mr. Walter then explained that he was a British citizen and had no Chinese living with him at all. However, the pseudo-"police" officers insisted on taking Mr. Walter to the pseudo-"police station" for questioning. The two sides argued for a long time without effect. Mr. Walter was then arrested and did not return until late at night. At the same time, a record player that Mr. Walter had prepared was also taken away by the pseudo-police officers. It is unknown what their purpose was. After the incident, the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which has jurisdiction, was reported and is now in negotiations.</p>

It was decided that the armed members of the Fuxing class would continue to inspect the area. After that, no Japanese went there again. At 6:00 am yesterday, several Japanese plainclothes military officers went to inspect the surroundings of the hospital for more than ten minutes before leaving.

<p>Were surprised to find that the Black Hawk had left the port on the morning of September 1. At that time, the US destroyers Pope and Pillsbury, which were docked in Yantai, had also arrived in Shanghai three days ago and were still docked in this port last night, but the future destinations of the two ships</p>
<p>Were Not Announced</p>
<p>And Will Not Be Announced. The Black Hawk will not sail to Shanghai this year, causing the tavern owners in this port to look worried, because they attract the most sailors during the two seasons each year, when the Asian Fleet sails from Manila in the spring and from Yantai in the autumn.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Foreigners Can Enlist in the British Army, The British King Has Issued an Order, But Shanghai Is Temporarily an Exception <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that it was heard in official circles today (5th) that the British King has recently issued an order that foreigners can now enlist in the British Army and be appointed as officers. Currently, Shanghai will not be affected by the order. Many Poles or Czechs living in Britain will immediately join the British Army. However, the enlistment of foreigners in the British Army stationed abroad will be delayed. Recruitment will only be ordered when it is deemed necessary. The British Consulate General in Shanghai has already registered all British citizens for national service and has also recorded non-British citizens who volunteered to join the British Army last week. Therefore, these non-British citizens will not be immediately affected by the British King's new order. However, if the British authorities do recruit them, it will be announced at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Japanese Military Spokesman Claims They Will Not Attack Changsha; Actually Uses Attitude of Chinese Spokesman to Explain Changsha Has No Military Value <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports: Yesterday afternoon (the 4th), a Japanese military spokesman stated that the Japanese army in northern Hunan may or may not attack Changsha. The spokesman could not disclose the purpose of the Japanese army's offensive east of Dongting Lake. However, the spokesman hinted that the Japanese army might avoid the provincial capital of Hunan and continue its offensive in "a certain direction." Perhaps the spokesman's remarks regarding Changsha were intentionally ambiguous. The spokesman recalled that a Chinese spokesman had declared that Changsha "no longer has any military value." Japanese commanders may agree with this assessment by the Chinese side, but this decision must be made by senior staff officers. One thing can be stated with certainty: one of the Japanese army's objectives in fighting in Hunan Province is to inflict significant commercial and material losses on the Chinese side.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Japanese Force Relocation of Muslim Cemetery; Muslim Community Holds Emergency Meeting; Strenuously Argue for Route Change to Preserve Original State; Matter Concerns Religious Property, Attracting Citywide Muslim Attention <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenru Muslim Cemetery is being forcibly moved because the Japanese are planning to build a railway there. The Fuyou Road Mosque has convened a citywide meeting of representatives from various Muslim organizations. The result was a decision by the Muslims to work together in the coming days to negotiate with the Japanese based on reason, demanding a change of route in order to preserve the original state of the cemetery. A reporter from Daguan News Agency has investigated and reported the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Muslim Representatives' Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The Zhenru Muslim Cemetery and the Niuye Guild land originally belonged to the Fuyou Road Mosque and comprised more than twenty mu, with approximately eight hundred graves. After the cemetery keeper reported to the mosque that the Japanese were planning to seize the cemetery land to build a railway, forcing the relocation of graves, the mosque posted notices to all families of the deceased, soliciting opinions for discussion at the meeting. At the same time, they printed leaflets explaining the truth of the matter and distributed them to Muslims throughout the city. Upon hearing the news, Muslim organizations throughout the city were extremely indignant and convened an emergency meeting of Muslim representatives the previous evening. Over forty representatives from mosques and missions in Fuyou Road, Zhejiang Road, Xiaoshadu Road, Pudong, and Hudong attended. A representative from the Fuyou Road Mosque reported on the Japanese seizure of the cemetery land. Representatives expressed their opinions separately, their emotions were agitated, and their attitudes were indignant. It was decided that Muslims would work together to negotiate with the Japanese based on reason, demanding a change of route to preserve the original state of the cemetery. They then discussed the opinions of the families of the deceased and adjourned the meeting around 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Matter Concerns Religious Property, Struggle Based on Reason</p>
<p>Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Muslim community told the Daguan News Agency that Islam originated in Mecca, Egypt (referred to as "Tianfang" by Muslims). The prophet is Muhammad. Countries around the world, such as Turkey, Egypt, the Balkans, India, Abyssinia, Australia, England, America, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Japan, all have Muslim populations. Islam in China dates back to the Tang Dynasty. There are over 30 million Muslims throughout the country, with the largest populations in the northwest in Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia, followed by various provinces, cities, and counties. The Japanese seizure of the Muslim cemetery is not just a matter for the Fuyou Road Mosque; it is a matter for all Muslims in the city and the country, and even for Muslims in countries around the world. Given the significance, the Fuyou Road Mosque authorities do not dare to act alone and rashly adopt any measures to negotiate with the Japanese. News will be communicated to Muslims throughout the city at any time to determine how to respond. They will argue reasonably. A Cantonese man, He Muxi, 61 years old, living at No. 4 Dexing Lane, North Jiangxi Road, recently purchased several large bundles of firewood from a certain place. Last night, He used a knife to split the bamboo hoops on the firewood, but in the center of the firewood was a bomb. After He vigorously chopped the wood, the bomb was detonated by the impact. He's left and right hands were injured and he was transported to Renji Hospital by ambulance. It is said that his right hand has been blown off.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Free Transport of Rice to Shanghai Resolved; Rice Prices Plummet; Approximately 10,000 Bags Arrive in Shanghai Daily; Food Supply No Longer Feared to be Scarce <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>New rice from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has successively entered the market, and due to favorable weather, there has been a bumper harvest. The issue of free transport of rice to Shanghai has also been resolved. As a result, various rice industry groups are making every effort to dredge sources of supply, purchasing from various producing areas, transporting rice to Shanghai for market adjustment. In recent days, the volume of rice transported by river, train and ship from Kunshan, Changzhou, Jiaxing, Wuhu, Songjiang and other places has been from 8,000 to 15,000 bags per day. As a result, Shanghai's stock of rice has gradually increased, market prices have fallen by three to four yuan, and the trend is expected to continue. Therefore, there is no concern of lack of food. Furthermore, although the arrival of rice in Shanghai has been surging, it is all Jiangbei Xian rice, therefore, although the price of Xian rice has continued to fall, the price of Bai Geng rice has remained stable. Yesterday, a large number of Songjiang Bai Geng rice, no less than 8,000 bags, was transported by river. As a result, the opening price of this Bai Geng rice in the rice market yesterday fell by five yuan per shi. The price per shi, which was originally 37 yuan, has fallen to 32 yuan yesterday. Jiangbei Xian rice also continued to fall by one yuan per shi due to the continued arrival of goods, with the highest price being 31 yuan. However, due to the scarcity of Changshu Bai Geng rice, the price per shi still costs 42 yuan. As for Nanjing brown rice, the price per shi is only 18 yuan. If transportation is not obstructed in the future, prices should not be expected to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Son of Deceased Zi Yun Sues Stepmother for Embezzlement; Misappropriating Property of Younger Son Held in Trust; Defendant Claims Plaintiff Did Not Provide Support; Court Orders Reconciliation, Assault Case Not Tried <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Lou Buqing, son of the deceased former head of the Shanghai Songhu Police Department's Investigation Team, section chief of the second district of the Jiangsu Water Police, and native of Hangzhou, Zhejiang (34 years old this year, currently residing at No. 4, Yi Li, Fahuaxi Town, Columbia Road, Shanghai, formerly worked in the baggage room of the Suzhou Railway Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, and left his job when the Suzhou station was evacuated after the 83 war). Lou Buying, (25 years old this year, currently residing at No. 11 Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, formerly worked at the Ningbo Telephone Company, recently resigned due to illness).</p>
<p>Two brothers</p>
<p>Recently, they engaged a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court against their stepmother, Lou Wu (also known as Lou Wuhen, age unknown, currently living with the second plaintiff, as the fourth concubine of Lou Ziyun) for embezzling property, requesting investigation, and an ancillary civil suit, requesting the court to order the return of property rights, etc. It is claimed that the plaintiffs' father, Lou Ziyun, died in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927). The plaintiffs divided the inheritance. At that time, it was agreed that Buying's</p>
<p>share of the property</p>
<p>would be managed by the defendant, and the deed to the house located at No. 28 Xibanbei Lane, Panmen, Suzhou, which Buqing inherited, would also be kept by the defendant. However, the plaintiffs became unemployed after the war and once left Shanghai to seek work in Hong Kong. When they returned to Shanghai, the defendant's attitude suddenly changed, unlike in the past. Later, they found out that all the Xicheng Lane houses leased by their late father had been changed by the defendant to</p>
<p>Wuhen's name</p>
<p>with the rental office. Only then did the plaintiffs realize that she</p>
<p>harbored ill intentions.</p>
<p>It was not appropriate to have the property managed by her. They demanded that she hand over the property rights she held in trust, but not only did she refuse, but she also claimed that Buying had committed violence, falsely reported to the police station, and led the police to arrest him. Because there was no evidence, the matter was not pursued. The plaintiffs could no longer tolerate it, so they hired a lawyer to send a letter to negotiate, but the defendant ignored it and hired a lawyer to publish a statement that the property belonged to her. The plaintiffs immediately published a rebuttal, but the defendant again claimed that Buying had not provided for her support and refused to hand over the property rights. According to</p>
<p>the time of the property division,</p>
<p>although there was the matter of the defendant returning to Buying to provide support, before the war, he was responsible for the entire family's livelihood. Now, because he lost his job after the war, he is accused of being idle and not doing his job. Moreover, the rental income from the Xicheng Lane houses is enough to support the defendant's personal life with surplus. Now she is embezzling under false pretenses, which clearly violates Article 335 of the Criminal Code. They request an investigation and an order for the return of the property rights, etc. Lou Wu also filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Lou Buqing brothers of assault, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Both sides countersue</p>
<p>The court, upon receiving the complaint, opened the second courtroom for trial yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. The Lou Buqing brothers and their lawyers stated that the defendant, Lou Wu, had embezzled the property. The defendant, Lou Wu, delegated a lawyer to state on her behalf that there was no dispute over the property rights held in trust for Buying. However, the property rights belonging to Buqing were not held in trust by the defendant, and the housing deed held in trust for Buying was submitted to the Suzhou Land Bureau for exchange of certificates, as evidenced by the receipt from the Suzhou Land Bureau. However, Buying must bear the defendant's</p>
<p>living expenses and support.</p>
<p>The defendant can return the property rights. After verifying the statements in court, the court ordered a postponement until the 12th for the defendant to appear in court for further questioning, and instructed both parties to try to reconcile out of court. Because Lou Wu did not arrive, the hearing on the assault case was not conducted.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Losing Lawsuit Over Temple Property; Threatening Lawyer; Gu Zhuxuan Also Receives Threatening Letter <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, owner of the Tianchan Stage, and lawyer Zhu Qichen, of No. 403, Taihe Building, Labourdonnais Road, each received a bizarre, similar threatening letter one week ago. Gu and Zhu reported the situation to the Old Zha Police Station. After the police station checked the handwriting, they determined that the two letters were written by the same person. After a secret investigation by lawyer Zhu Qichen, it was believed that Yangxi, the monk of Leshan Temple at the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and Avenue Dubail, French Concession, was suspected of being involved. Four months ago, Lawyer Zhu was entrusted by a monk named Qinliang to handle a lawsuit involving temple property with Yangxi and Yuanhua. Yuanhua and Yangxi lost the case. Zhu then reported to the French police station the day before yesterday and had the two monks Yangxi and Yuanhua arrested, and then transferred them to the Old Zha Police Station. Lawyer Zhu also presented other handwriting of Yangxi as evidence. The police station has now sent the two letters and Yangxi's handwriting to the appraisal office for appraisal. Yangxi and Yuanhua are temporarily released on bail pending verification.</p>
<h3 id="e80">French Police Department Protects Resident Safety; Strictly Arresting Hooligans; To Reduce Extortion and Solicitation <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the concession areas of Shanghai were relatively stable, so refugees from all over the world flocked to them, causing an unprecedented increase in the number of residents in the concessions. The French Concession Police Department believes that in recent times, there have often been strangers in the area who are unfamiliar with the situation in Shanghai and are often extorted by hooligans and thugs. This type of case accounts for a large proportion of recent crimes, so it is believed that it is not enough to make the citizens live in peace without completely eliminating the hooligans in the area. Therefore, a special team was established a few days ago, consisting of Chief Inspector Dai Rongji, detectives Weng Huanzhang, Li Shuren, Wan Minghai and others from the Criminal Division, to specifically eliminate hooligans in the area. Residents are also requested to report to the police station any incidents of extortion or solicitation of illegal fees from merchants, and they will be severely punished without any leniency.</p>

<p>Fang Shengui, a native of Fujian, is 20 years old. He came to Shanghai from his hometown to purchase goods. He took the Haikou Steamer. Because he was lonely on the way, he communicated with Zheng Fuqing, a fellow passenger, and they became very friendly because they were both from the same hometown and of similar age. On the 2nd of this month, the steamer arrived in port. Fang and Zheng opened a room at the Oriental Hotel, No. 356 Yu Qiaqing Road and stayed overnight. The next morning, Fang, because he</p>
<p>was unfamiliar with the way,</p>
<p>invited Zheng to go to a certain money house on Bazi Road to get 1,800 yuan in cash, and returned to the hotel together. Fang put 100 yuan aside for pocket money, and hid the rest in a small leather box. Unexpectedly, Zheng Fuqing, although he looked like a dapper young man in Western clothes, actually harbored evil intentions. In the afternoon, he used a trick and made an excuse that the scenery of Zhaofeng Park in Shanghai was quite good, why not take a trip. Fang agreed and went to Zhaofeng Park together. First, they went to the drinking room to drink shaved ice. After more than ten minutes, Zheng</p>
<p>claimed to have a stomachache</p>
<p>and urgently needed to defecate. He told Fang to wait a moment, and then left. Fang waited for more than half an hour, but Zheng did not return. Fang knew that something was wrong and urgently called the Oriental Hotel to inquire, and learned that Zheng had gone back and left ten minutes ago. Fang hired a car back to the Oriental Hotel, and saw that the lock on the small leather box in the room was broken, and 1,700 yuan of French currency had disappeared. Fang knew that Zheng had stolen it, and urgently reported it to the Old Zha Police Station, which sent Detective Xue Youwen to investigate. It was learned that Zheng had entrusted his clothes to the Fuyu Laundry Company, No. 727, nearby for washing, so he notified the laundry shop that if Zheng came to pick up his clothes, he should be detained. The other day,</p>
<p>a tea servant from the Cathay Hotel</p>
<p>went to pick up the clothes and was detained by the detectives. After interrogation, it was learned that Zheng was in room 412 of the Cathay Hotel. He was arrested and 300 Hong Kong dollars, 381.60 French dollars, and a Hong Kong boat ticket (prepared to take a boat to Hong Kong), as well as leather box and bird gun and other items were confiscated. All were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 4 of the Special Court No. 1. The police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case and requested a postponement. When questioning Zheng Fuqing, his statement was hesitant. The court ordered him to be detained pending further verification.</p>

<p>On September 15th, at 7:15 PM, Chinese constables Nos. 1663, 1228, and 2557 of the Gordon Road Police Station were patrolling the area of Connaught Road and Great Western Road in western Shanghai. They were suddenly surrounded by a crowd of about fifteen thugs, each with automatic pistols and other weapons. The thugs snatched three pistols and eighteen bullets from the three Chinese constables and fled with howls. Subsequently, the armored car team of the police station in the district, composed of both Western and Chinese detectives, arrested three suspects, Wang Xiusheng, Wang Jinlong, and Tao Jinquan, natives of Anhui, and brought them to the police station. They confessed to being members of the so-called "Self-Defense Corps" and claimed that the "Corps" lacked weapons, hence the move. They admitted to being responsible for keeping watch while the three Chinese constables' guns were robbed, and confessed to robbing several hundred yuan of property from the Big Barrel General Machine set up by Mao A'xiang, the King of the Flower Show in western Shanghai. They were sent to the First Special District Court, and the police station filed a public prosecution on charges of robbery. The court concluded the debate and waited for the verdict. Yesterday morning, the presiding judge issued a verdict in the Criminal Court No. 3, sentencing Wang Xiusheng, Wang Jinlong, and Tao Jinquan to</p>
<p>five years of imprisonment each</p>
<p>for armed robbery, as a warning. If they did not agree with the verdict, they could file an appeal within ten days. The three criminals knew they had violated the criminal law, so they bowed their heads and obeyed.</p>

<p>Zhang Da, a native of Wujin, is 57 years old. He currently practices as a lawyer at No. 120 Guizhou Road. In the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937),</p>
<p>the Ministry ordered</p>
<p>him to be appointed as a prosecutor in the Yichang District Court. Later, he was transferred to serve as a judge in the Hankou District Court. At that time, he carried</p>
<p>baggage worth 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>in twelve pieces from Shanghai, which were packed into ten large pieces. He entrusted the Zhen Da Weiji Customs Brokerage opened by Zhu Qirong, a native of Ningbo, at No. 18 Xin Yong'an Street, French Concession, for transportation. At that time, the National Army had not yet withdrawn from the suburbs of Shanghai, and all transportation was extremely convenient. However, Zhang was still afraid that obstacles would occur on the road, so he specifically requested a passport from Yang Hu, the commander of the Shanghai Songhu Garrison, and gave it to the Zhen Da Customs Brokerage to transport the baggage together. Unexpectedly, until ten years after the National Army withdrew from Hankou, this baggage had not been received. Zhang then came to Shanghai and practiced law. He repeatedly entrusted people to negotiate with Zhen Da, but they always gave vague excuses. Zhang had no way, so he hired lawyer Wang Xintang to file a complaint with the Second Special Court, accusing the customs brokerage owner Zhu Qirong of embezzlement and breach of trust, and requested that the court order the return of the baggage or compensation for losses of 20,000 yuan in national currency. The court approved the complaint, and yesterday Judge Miao opened the Criminal Court No. 2 to summon the defendant. The defendant failed to arrive because the door number on the subpoena, No. 18, was mistakenly written as No. 180. The court briefly questioned the plaintiff, Zhang Yuanzheng, and then ordered the case to be adjourned to the 14th of this month for further hearing.</p>

<p>Zhou Yongjie, a native of Ningbo, 50 years old, lives at No. A228 Haig Road, Western Shanghai. In his early years, he ran a business and was quite diligent, so he had some savings. Zhou has a son, around 20 years old, who usually hangs out with hooligans, practices inferior habits, and repeatedly demands money from his father to squander outside. Recently, he repeatedly demanded money from his father, but Zhou did not give him any. His son therefore harbored resentment in his heart. Around 10 o'clock last night, Zhou's son suddenly had an evil idea and went to Zhou Yongjie's bedroom, seeing his father sleeping sweetly in bed. Zhou's son connected an electric wire to the current, one end attached to Zhou Yongjie's body. After Zhou was electrocuted, he fainted. Zhou's son used a sharp knife to slash Zhou Yongjie's head, splitting his skull, and slashed each of his legs, breaking all the leg bones. He died on the spot. Zhou's son carried a wooden box from outside to his father's bedroom, intending to put his father's body into the box, when someone reported the arrival of nearby Chinese police, who arrested Zhou's son on the spot.

<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>We are a group of graduates from the Wireless Radio Specialization Department of the First China Vocational Supplementary School. Around the time of our graduation, a classmate, Mr. So-and-so, informed us that the Inland Aviation Administration and the Transportation Department (Southwest Highway) radio stations were recruiting over eighty radio operators in Shanghai. The lowest monthly salary was eighty yuan (for a third-class operator). After being hired, travel expenses to the interior would be subsidized by the organization. The first examination was to be held at the ×× Wireless Radio Specialized School. What a wonderful opportunity! We were all filled with joy, hoping that after passing the exam, we could realize our dream—to serve our motherland!</p>
<p>This was on July 18th. We went to the ×× School to register and learned that the examination would be held at 6:00 PM on the 19th. At that time, according to the regulations, we each paid a registration fee of two yuan, and submitted two photos and resumes. With the receipt in hand, we waited for the 19th. That day was when a typhoon hit Shanghai, and it rained heavily. Braving the wind and rain, we rushed to the ×× Radio School for the examination. Upon arrival, we saw a notice posted stating that the examiner, a radio operator from the ×× Shipping Company, surnamed Gong, named ××, had been delayed due to the typhoon preventing the ship from docking, so the examination would be postponed. We then returned home. For three consecutive days, it was all for naught. We were very surprised. How could a state institution be so unreliable with its examination schedule? However, we believed that the ×× Radio School had a considerable history and reputation in Shanghai, so it would certainly not engage in falsehoods to deceive us young people.</p>
<p>The examination was held at 6:00 PM on the 22nd. One chief examiner and three or four proctors were present, with over thirty applicants. After four hours, the examination ended. At this time, our heavy hearts gradually lightened, and we only hoped for the results to be announced. Several days later, we learned that some of us (the writers of this letter) had been accepted. How delighted we were! Our hopes were about to be realized! We were also told that we would have to depart within two months. Therefore, we all prepared our luggage, waiting to embrace our motherland and serve the country two months later. At that time, we felt indescribable joy and relief!</p>
<p>Now, two months have passed since the examination date. Ah! Truly, "the heavens have unpredictable winds, and humans have sudden misfortunes." A few days ago, we suddenly received a mimeographed letter from the ×× Radio School sent to each applicant. After reading the letter, it was like a bolt from the blue, shocking everyone. The letter stated: "The examiner, Gong ××, has not yet provided a departure date, and is now even demanding a security deposit of five yuan per person... This method seems deceitful, so we have decided to immediately refund the registration fees previously collected..." We still cannot figure out how such a reputable radio school could do such a senseless thing. Mr. Gong used the school as an examination site, so prior arrangements must have been made, and the school must have trusted Mr. Gong. We trusted the ×× Radio School. Our registration fees were paid at the school's accounting office, and we took the examination at the school, so the ×× Radio School must bear responsibility. Unexpectedly, this is the result, which has surprised us all... Alas! Because of this so-called opportunity, we waited wholeheartedly for two months. Knowing that we had been accepted and would be sent to work in the interior, we did not apply for the openly advertised radio operator positions at schools such as the St. Louis Radio School recently. Who knew that now the ×× Radio School would inform the applicants that this matter was a fraud. Then, won't we have to look for another opportunity? But when will we have the chance? It has been over two months since we graduated from school. If things continue like this, won't the skills we have learned gradually decline and become rusty? The youth's time is the most precious time in life. Waiting like this on a deserted island is a significant loss for us! (Responsibility for the text rests with the author)</p>

<p>— Bao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Promote Medical Education and Build Schools; Thinking About Expanding Village Governance and Providing Care for Children</p>
<p>There is another bad custom: using celebrations and condolences as a way to make money and seek profit. This is less common in the countryside, but more prevalent in cities. For example, when an old lady turns a certain age, her birthday must indeed be celebrated, and the post-birthday feast cannot be forgone. When a stepmother turns a certain age, her birthday must indeed be celebrated, but the biological mother's celebration must be even more lively. In addition, birthdays of paternal aunts, maternal aunts, mothers-in-law, and foster mothers are all opportunities to gather materials for birthday celebrations. There are even cases where a birthday is celebrated in the first half of the year, and another one is celebrated in the second half. If the old lady has already passed away, then a posthumous birthday can be celebrated if a regular one cannot. Later, the death anniversaries of parents and grandparents are treated the same as regular birthdays, with invitations sent out widely and gifts collected extensively. In reality, when a person is dead, what birthday is there? If it stems from sincere remembrance, family rituals and memorial services are acceptable, but why the need for such grand displays? This shows that the intention is not really about the celebration. Later, Shanghai's pleasure-seekers even sought revenge and retaliation because of not sending gifts when sending invitations, resulting in violent altercations. The matter of gift-giving can be said to have reached its extreme. Therefore, there was a backlash later, with society generally refraining from giving gifts for celebrations and condolences. If close relatives and friends occasionally offer a gift, that is an exception. The gifts given are either souvenirs or necessities. Items like banners and silver shields are completely useless waste, and of course, they have disappeared. Even the market no longer sells such items. Therefore, there were very few people giving gifts at Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyun's wedding this time. However, one cannot say there were absolutely none. Close friends and confidants also gave them gifts, but they could give them at any time, without having to crowd around at this particular moment. Just like among her sisters, Zhu Airen might not give her anything, but the He sisters would definitely give something. It is unknown what the Wu Junsou sisters would do, but they would probably give some souvenirs. It is guessed that Mrs. Su Liya's gift would be the biggest. At eight o'clock on Friday morning, Zhu Village Chief called his granddaughter. He said, "Yesterday, the village council meeting was held, and the matter of the He sisters' silk weaving factory site has been approved. However, what kind of building will be built in the future? What kind of equipment will be used? The layout will still have to be reviewed once. You inform them both!" Airen obediently agreed, and also told him, "I won't be coming to Freedom Village next week because everyone is going to Shanghai to attend Jin Danyun's wedding. Also, the He sisters received a telegram from their grandfather saying that a paternal elder is coming to Shanghai from the north, and they will also go to visit him to discuss the silk factory. Because that paternal elder is currently a shareholder and used to run a silk weaving factory, he is an expert who should be consulted." (188)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Gas Lamps (Mechanical Poetic Talk) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Ru Hui</p>
<p>Before electric lights, Shanghai also had "gas lamps."</p>
<p>Wang Tao's "Ying Ruan Magazine" (1875), Volume Six, states:</p>
<p>Westerners have erected lamps in the streets, spaced closely or sparsely according to distance. The lamps are all made of hexagonal glass, shining like stars from afar. Later, they were replaced with gas, which is even brighter. This is because the gas from coal mines is gathered and ignited, so the light is far-reaching and dazzling... It can be seen that "gas lamps" appeared in Shanghai during the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty, and were regarded as "miracles." Therefore, people at the time created the "Ten Views of Northern Shanghai," and this was one of them, titled "Night Market Lamps," and they praised it with the following verse:</p>
<p>Thousands of electric lights connect iron pipes,</p>
<p>Most suitable for dance halls and singing banquets.</p>
<p>No need to envy the purple light offerings of old,</p>
<p>A city that never sleeps all night long.</p>
<p>At that time, Shanghai had only a few "gas lamps," but it became a "city that never sleeps." However, this is not an "exaggeration." Ciqi Zhiting's "Four Poems on Yangjing" described the mystery of "gas lamps" even more vividly. The poem reads:</p>
<p>Living fire burns thousands of flowers,</p>
<p>Bright stars illuminate ten thousand homes.</p>
<p>Pavilions are never dark in spring nights,</p>
<p>The scenery is vast and boundless.</p>
<p>Trying to outshine the silver toad [moon],</p>
<p>Truly opening iron tree blossoms.</p>
<p>Climbing high and looking far,</p>
<p>Seemingly scattering red city clouds.</p>
<p>The topic is called "Ground Fire," which was a very common name at the time. The old owner of Twenty-Three Rooms also filled in "Looking South of the River" to praise it, calling it:</p>
<p>Shanghai is good, ground fire is the brightest.</p>
<p>The bronze dragon counts the hours, boasting a sleepless night,</p>
<p>Iron trees bloom, illuminating the deep night,</p>
<p>Even clearer than the moon.</p>
<p>This is written in a more tranquil way. However, most writers only regarded it as the moon. Su Kanghou's poem: "No need to carry candles in this scenic spot, round pearls replace the moon and are even brighter. No need to waste money to buy, heaven opens a city that never sleeps at sea." is of this kind. "Shanghai Northern Bamboo Branch" also praised "ground fire":</p>
<p>Thousands of lamps stand west to east,</p>
<p>Fire comes naturally, seizing the work of nature.</p>
<p>No need to burn tallow to boast of extending the day,</p>
<p>Night walks are always in the moonlight.</p>
<p>The end note says: "Lamps are placed on poles to illuminate the road. The fire comes from underground passages, the light is extremely bright and never goes out all night." Therefore, at the time, "gas lamps" were also called "self-lighting fire." As for "ground fire all night," "Shenpu Bamboo Branch Words" also mentioned it, saying that "ground fire passes through everywhere." The poem directly praising it reads:</p>
<p>Most ingenious is the smokeless ground fire,</p>
<p>Bright light, faces slightly flushed.</p>
<p>Up and down the building, all are illuminated,</p>
<p>Who can discern the mechanisms in the dark?</p>
<p>The last two lines are very good. The strangest is the author of "Shanghai City Miscellaneous Poems," who cursed "gas lamps" as "ghost fire," calling "ghost fire clustering like stars, Zhang Hai Market." This person was probably a very conservative type. But most authors only had praise. Until "electric lights" were established, the enthusiasm for praising "ground fire" turned to "electric lights." However, in the early days of "electric lights," which was also the transitional period from "gas lamps" to "electric lights," there were also those who praised both sides. This is evidenced by the "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Words" of the owner of the Southern Border Double Red Bean Pavilion:</p>
<p>Shanghai is clearly a city that never sleeps,</p>
<p>Electric lights and gas lamps compete in beauty.</p>
<p>Making people unable to distinguish the round moon,</p>
<p>Let alone say tonight is the Lantern Festival.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Two Stages Compete to Hire Xun Huisheng; There Are Still Problems with His Coming to Shanghai <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng, one of the Four Great Dan performers, has not come south to perform since his appearance at the Tianchan Stage in the twenty-second year, which is already six years ago. (Three years ago, Huisheng once came to Shanghai to attend Zhang Xiaolin's sixtieth birthday celebration.) Precisely because of this, the Golden Theater and the Renewal Stage both want to invite Mr. Xun to Shanghai. After the two theaters sent people to contact Huisheng separately, the news of Xun Huisheng's coming to Shanghai to perform spread to almost every Peking Opera enthusiast's ears.</p>
<p>After many twists and turns, as a result of the two theaters' unrelenting efforts, the truth tells us this: Xun Huisheng will come south in mid-September of the lunar calendar, and the heads of the two theaters will resolve this difficult problem with emotions. ——Xun Huisheng will first perform at the Renewal Stage for half a month (taking over from Wu Suqiu, Zhao Jinrong, and others), and after that, he will go to the Golden Theater for one month (taking over from Wang Yurong). Unexpectedly, after the Renewal Stage's talent scout Chang returned to Shanghai to report back, Xun Huisheng suddenly sent a telegram to a certain influential person connected to Renewal, saying that he did not acknowledge having reached an agreement with the Renewal talent scout to come to Shanghai on time to take over from Wu Suqiu and others. Therefore, the matter of Huisheng's coming to Shanghai has changed again in unseen ways.</p>
<p>It is said that Huisheng and Renewal have not reached an agreement because of business matters. Xun Huisheng is treating Renewal with an attitude of recognizing money but not people, wanting to use a huge performance fee to make the Renewal authorities give up on him. His intention is that after Renewal gives up, he can resolutely come to Shanghai to perform at the Golden Theater. In fact, the Golden Theater had indeed formally invited Huisheng a long time ago.</p>
<p>The Renewal Stage's matter with Huisheng now hinges entirely on a difference in numbers. Renewal's General Manager Mr. Dong Zhaobin's intention is to express discouragement because of Huisheng's deliberate obstruction. However, after hearing "a casual remark" from a certain influential person, if the influential person's intention is that there is no need to invite him again, the Renewal authorities will decisively give up on Xun Huisheng and bring Tan Fuying and Tan Xiaopei, father and son, to Shanghai to perform ahead of schedule. As for the Golden Theater, because they had smooth negotiations with Huisheng before, they expressed great confidence in Huisheng's coming to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The affairs of opera troupes are often infinitely variable. It is possible that Xun Huisheng can still meet the people of Shanghai according to the original plan. However, besides this problem, there is another problem, which is that Wang Yurong's supporting actors, the young male lead Jin Zhongren, the clown Zhu Binxian, and the painted face Jiang Shaoqiu, are all members of Xun Huisheng's troupe. If Wang Yurong performs at the Golden Theater before Huisheng, Jin Zhongren and others will have to come with Yurong. There is no problem with this on the Golden Theater's side, but on the Renewal side, it is an unexpected complication because in reality, it is absolutely not allowed for Jin Zhongren and others to perform in both theaters.</p>
<p>It is said that Xun Huisheng's staff members and supporting cast all want to come south. Huisheng himself is not unwilling to come to Shanghai. However, all leading actors have a certain arrogance, which is that if someone invites him, he must put on a full display of airs. I am also a member who loves and protects Huisheng. I hope Boss Xun will not be too much like that. Because this decision is undoubtedly giving Huisheng a great opportunity. One must know that opportunities are not always available. If this opportunity is missed, I am afraid there will not be such a good opportunity again.</p>
<h3 id="e94">After the Outbreak of the European War: The Trend of Hollywood <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>After a considerable period of brewing, the European war has finally transitioned from a propaganda war to a formal war. Although Hollywood, the world's only film city, is separated by vast oceans, it has been significantly affected by the European war. In particular, the following points are especially prominent:</p>
<p>Changing Film Production Policies Europe is the largest overseas market for American films, especially Britain, which is an excellent market for Hollywood productions. Therefore, this European war has severely hit the overseas market for Hollywood films, especially since Britain is also one of the main warring countries. As a result, Hollywood film companies immediately changed their policies regarding film production, and all films centered on European film audiences were stopped from being filmed.</p>
<p>Movie Stars Return Home to Serve When we recall the previous European war, many foreign movie stars in Hollywood returned home to serve, some even fighting on the battlefield. So this time, after the outbreak of the European war, it is certainly no exception that foreign movie stars will be conscripted back home. For example, Charles Boyer has returned to France to serve, and people like Colman have also returned to England. If the war continues, there will certainly be many more foreign film workers who will return to their countries to take on various wartime tasks and serve their country!</p>
<p>Promoting the South American Market In recent years, the Spanish war and the Sino-Japanese conflict have reduced Hollywood's overseas film market. The outbreak of this European war has had an even more serious impact on Hollywood. In this situation, Hollywood film companies have shifted their attention to South American countries, making every effort to promote the market in South America and Central America. Therefore, we have recently seen films depicting South American scenery being shown continuously, which is also a shift in Hollywood's direction in the midst of the European war!</p>

<h3 id="e95">Splendid Rivers and Mountains <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Enterprise</p>
<p>"Juarez"</p>
<p>"Splendid Rivers and Mountains" narrates the story of Mexican President Juarez in the mid-19th century, resisting the French army that invaded Mexico. Although most of the cities were captured, and although the puppet Maximilian was crowned under the instigation of Napoleon III, Juarez remained calm and firm. He rejected Maximilian's moderation and extinguished the rebellion of Vice President Urandi with the fire of justice. Finally, with the support of the military and the people, Juarez recovered Mexico's splendid rivers and mountains.</p>
<p>From this story, it gives us the following lessons: (1) Juarez's indomitable spirit of resistance finally led to the final victory; while the French army, which traveled long distances and hoped to fulfill its ambitions of aggression, was inevitably doomed to failure. (2) Maximilian's puppet appearance was indeed deceived by General Baron. When he discovered that Baron wanted him to sign a document authorizing the confiscation of people's property and the execution of those who privately stored military supplies, he still hoped to "cooperate" with Juarez. He did not completely see that in the autumn of national survival, there is only absolute "yes" and "no," and there is no middle ground. (3) Vice President Urandi's conspiracy and rebellion also finally collapsed before justice.</p>
<p>The role of Juarez is played by Paul Muni. With his refined acting skills, he plays the great man in history. His bright and energetic eyes and firm and calm demeanor are truly awe-inspiring! The role of Maximilian is played by Brian Aherne. From his puppet appearance, being deceived, compromising, to failing, he can portray the conflict of psychological contradictions in every process, which is completely different from the unrefined hero Fleury in "New Gold Mountain." Bette Davis, as Maximilian's wife Carlota, demonstrates her superb acting skills in comforting her husband and going mad after seeing Napoleon. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Xu</p>
<p>Shanghai Should Create a Theater for Joint Performances of Qin, Pi, and Huang Operas</p>
<p>Recently, Song Dezhu's "Jinshan Temple" has been staged at the Sun Theater. This play combines civil, military, Kunqu, and miscellaneous styles in a furnace, deeply catering to Shanghai customers' tastes. The skillful and steady fighting at the end, combined with the tight and rigorous stage presence, makes the whole play impeccable, with no one missing a beat or leaving the stage. This is truly a rare occurrence in fighting plays. What is wonderful is that, in addition to the drummer and cymbal player who are slightly older, the others, such as those playing the erhu, sanxian, moon guitar, and small drums, are all children around ten years old. This situation is probably only seen by Shanghai residents. It is not well known that the Beijing Opera School originally had a music theory department, with the renowned Cao Xinquan responsible for guidance. Therefore, many students of the school are able to master the stage thoroughly. Those who came with Xing Dezhu this time are probably alumni who graduated from the same department. In recent years, many new famous musicians have emerged, but many can only play the erhu and are not skilled in the flute and sona. Compared to the students of opera school, they are truly ashamed.</p>
<p>After watching this play, I have a lot of feelings. If we only talk about the first half of "Jinshan Temple," Dezhu may not be better than Han Shichang of the Northern Kunqu Opera Troupe. However, if we compare the current situations of Han and Song, it is simply one in the underground and one in the sky. In recent years, Peking Opera has developed abnormally, and Kunqu and Qin Opera have almost been submerged into obscurity. A few years ago, Shichang, in order to maintain the livelihood of his colleagues, once again acted as Feng Fu, performing in various ports in Pingjin. However, because the audience was sparse and the ticket prices were low, the daily ticket income was not enough to cover the cost of food and lodging for the entire troupe. Because Shichang still had income from teaching opera at a certain mansion, he declared that he was completely voluntary, and even his transportation expenses were not covered. However, he still had to pay the salary of one yuan to the employee who dressed his hair every day. ——(114)</p>
