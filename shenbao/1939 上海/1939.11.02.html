<p>社評</p>
<h3>上海工商業之前瞻</h3>
<p>上海普通商業習慣上所稱的十底比期，業已平安渡過，這不啻表示上海工商各業，還是相當的穩定。自「八一三」滬戰發生到現在，為時二年有餘，中國商民能在特殊的環境下，於狹小的租界範圍以內，恢復各種生產事業的活動；使數百萬中外居民，在租界當局和工商各界領袖善導之下，還能繼續着和平的生活，還能保全了一大部份的生活基礎，這種忍辱負重的精神，確也値得相當的欽佩。</p>
<p>不過近兩年來上海工商業的活動，充滿了投機景氣的氣息，在本質上並未因工商各界的努力，而發揮正常的機能。其主要的緣因，為匯市的變動和上海本身在環境上所受種種限制而引起的物價高漲，致一般囤積中外商品的大發其財；於是大衆都以為祗要從事工商業的活動，就有巨大的利潤可得，於是新創的商店工廠，有如雨後春筍，到現在不免有些積重難返的趨勢。最近十底比期之能獲得安然渡過，並非工商業的本身是怎樣的穩定；那不能不承認國民政府的措施是具有功効的。中中交農四大銀行所組成的貼放委員會，儘量辦理貼現抵押等放款，直接是調整同業金融，間接就是使工商各業獲得救濟。這是上海工商業經營者應當特別認識淸楚的。</p>
<p>就上海的局勢言，目前既非復興正常工商業的適當時期，事實上也沒有實現這種企圖的可能。成為孤島以後的上海，無論物品的輸出或輸入，都須負担一筆非法的很重的稅項支出；工商業經營者，雖仍可於他們自已的事業上獲得相當的利潤，但在國家財政經濟上的損失，却反而特別來得巨大；而且孤島工商業今後是吾可以自由經營，這也將成為一個日益嚴重的問題：不要說中國商民的經營，便是歐美商人的工商企業，也是遭受同樣的運命。上海所需要的物品，凡是從淪陷區域輸入的，差不多都已失去了運銷的自由。前幾天英美商行所收買的雞蛋，竟在租界中被人持强掠奪；早些時候浦東等處英國廠家的工潮，顯然是受暴力的壓迫操縱。至於由內地輸滬的物品，又因為土貨出口結滙的法令，這對於輸滬商品，當然也有相當的影響。至於由上海輸出的物品，在淪陷區域已為日貨所排擠凈盡；在內地除原料外，凡是上海製造的商品，國民政府為防止冒牌國貨起見，最近又一律禁止進口。而對於國外的輸出，自歐戰發生之後，不僅輸出的商品來源成問題，連運輸上也發生了困難。上海的工商業，本來是依賴轉口貿易而獲得正常發展的；現在却祗能以本埠的消費和囤戶的活動為重心了。</p>
<p>物價的高漲，過去曾鼓勵上海工商業以活動，今後就難免成為工商業活動的一個障礙物：因為上海的工商業，若祗以本埠為活動的對象，則上海的消費能力，實是有限得很；目前的物價可說已達相當的高度，如果再是繼續不斷增漲，消費者除却緊縮購買力以取得物價高漲的平衡外，恐怕沒有其他辦法可想；並且物價的騰貴，在投機景氣中，乃是各種物品一般的高漲，結果是支出方面也跟着收入而相對的增加，那末工商業經營者因交易的減少，各項支出的增加，未必還能獲得巨額的利潤，這就有促使本身崩潰的危險。</p>
<p>照上述情形看來，上海工商業實已進入極危險的階段。我們為社會安全計，為工商業本身計，不能不要求工面各業預先避免不幸事件的發生；第一應即終止所有的投機行動，穩定事業的發展；對於物價應極力壓低，至少要使其不再增漲。其决便應設法縮小工商各業的範圍，以便減少自身的風險，同時也可以減輕國家一部分的損失。若能以其在本埠經營之工業的毅力和精神，移轉其資金到內地去，對於國家就會有更大的補助。總之上海的工商業，現在祗能求其穩定，不能求其發展，因為現在的上海，祇能認為暫時資金逃難的塲所，而不能當作工商事業發展的中心。</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫在最高議會　闡述蘇聯外交政策　拈責英法繼續作戰為毫無意義　保持中立願為和平盡最大努力</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯最高議會今日舉行特會、史丹林與莫洛托夫及人民委員主席團其他諸人皆坐於演講壇上、英大使西資等在外交席旁聽、而駐莫斯科德國商業代表團領袖亦在座、前蘇聯外長李維諾夫坐議員席、在現任國際共產黨秘書長狄米晚羅夫之側、各方議員依决就座、最後就座者為四烏克蘭與西白俄羅斯新近舉出之代表、會議中形形色色、有頭裹白巾之老嫗、有身着艷服之村女、並有服裝不整之男子、開會時演講壇上置有電影機、</p>
<p>外長莫洛托夫致開會詞、對於英法拒不與德議和事、大事抨擊、有「假藉為民治國奮鬥之名義、作摧殘希特勒主義之戰爭、不獨毫無意識且為罪惡、英法之所以決心繼續作戰者、蓋以德國將要求殖民地、而英國將喪失其世界霜權為慮耳、人人皆知恢復舊波蘭國現巳不成問題、故在恢復波蘭旗幟下之現有戰爭欲圖繼續進行、實為荒謬、蘇聯將來目的在（一）國際事件中之自由手腕、（二）中立政策之賡續、（三）戰爭之停止、蘇日商業談判不久可開、惟日本之欲改善蘇日關係究至何種程度、何時即可實現、則目前尙不明瞭」等語、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯人民委員長會議主席兼外交委員長莫洛托夫本日在蘇聯最高議會非常五屆全會發表報吿、其辭云、「諸位議員同志、過去兩月以來、國際形勢大有變遷、歐洲及其他各國均受影響、吾人於此必須述及之最重要事件、計有三項、</p>
<h3>蘇德修好波蘭瓦解　國際局勢根本變化</h3>
<p>「第一、蘇聯與德國之邦交已有變遷、自八月二十三日蘇德互不侵犯公的簽字以來、數年來兩國間不正常之關係業已中止、過去被歐洲某某國家努力挑撥而生之惡感、已一變而為敦睦友好、九月二十丸日在莫斯科簽定之德蘇友好劃界條的、尤使此善鄰關係續有進步、歐陸最大兩國邦交上述根本變化、對於整個國際形勢自不能不發生重大影響、而期內經過之一切、更證實上屆最高議會全會中對於蘇德修好的政治意義之估計、完全正確、</p>
<p>第二、彼蘭業已職敗、其國家業已瓦解、過去波蘭統治階級曾屢以亡國之「安定」及其陸軍之「强大」自豪、然而此凡爾賽和的之產物、以壓非波蘭籍少數民族為生之國家、一經德軍及紅軍相繼打擊、立即無影無踪、其傳統的無原則徘徊蘇德兩大之間、挑撥兩國惡感之政策、業巳完全破產、</p>
<p>第三、吾人必須承認歐洲爆發之大戰、巳使整個國際局勢發生根本變化、此大戰以德波戰爭開始、而演進為德國與英法之戰爭、德波戰爭因波蘭統治者之破產、業已迅速結束、英法艙與波蘭之保障、對於波蘭並無補助、事實上此種「保障」究屬何物、亦無人知之、至德國與英法之戰爭、則現方在最初階段、尙未充分發展、但吾人可以斷言、此種戰爭對於歐洲及世界必引起根本變化、</p>
<h3>蘇聯最高議會　議程三項</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯最高議會非常五届全會、本日在克姆林宮開幕、當晚舉行聯邦及民族兩院聯席會議、由聯邦院議長安德萊也夫任主席、史丹林·莫洛托夫·伏洛希羅夫·卡昂諾維支·加里寗·米柯揚·安德萊也夫·齊達諾夫·赫魯薛夫·席維尼克及貝里亞等出塲就席時、全塲歡聲雷動、出席全會之西烏克蘭及西白俄羅斯國民大會代表委員團、受全體議員熱烈歡迎、兩院聯席會議通過本屆非常全會議程如下、（一）報吿政府外交政策、（二）西烏克蘭國民大會代表委員團發表宣言、（三）西白俄羅斯國民大會代表委員團發表宣言、</p>
<p>上項議程經決議一律在兩院聯席會議席上討論後、人民委員長會議主席兼人民外交委員長莫洛托夫即開始報吿第一案、（三十一日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>舊公式已不復適用　思想非武力能摧毀</h3>
<p>局勢時、發生嚴重錯誤、例如在過去數月內、「侵略」及「侵略者」等術語、即已取得新的具體的界說及意義、吾人顯然不能續以三四個月前之意義、應用此類術語、就歐洲列强論之、德國現方努力迅速結束戰爭、謀取和平，而昨日尙詆毀侵略之英法兩國、茲則主戰繼續戰爭、反對和平、英法政府以彼等對於波蘭之義務、為此新立塲之理由、顯然並不充分、世人皆知恢復舊波蘭巳不成問題、故以恢復波蘭為繼續戰爭之理由實屬不當、英法政府亦深知此理、然彼等仍不願停戰言和、而覓取新藉口、以繼續對德作戰、最近英法統治階級方企圖以維護民主權利、反對希特勒主義之人物自居、英政府並曾宜佈其對德作戰之目的、僅「打倒希特勒主義」如此、英國及法國之主戰派顯已對德宣佈一種「思想」性質之戰爭、與古代之宗敎戰爭相類、過去此種排斥異端之戰爭曾風行一時、其結果則為人民之極端痛苦及各民族之經濟及文化破產墮落、此種戰爭乃中世紀的戰爭、英法統治階級豈欲吾人回到中世紀時代、回到宗敎戰爭迷信及文化之墮落乎、此種「思想」戰爭茲已爆發、其範圍至為廣大、其對於歐洲及世界人民之威脅至為嚴重、然此戰爭實絕無理由、人可以接受或排斥希特勒主義之思想、正與對於任何思想相同、此乃各人政治立塲之問題、然人人知思想乃不能以武力破壞或以戰爭消滅之物、故假借為「民主」作戰之假面具以進行「毀滅希特勒主義」之戰爭、實不但毫無意義、且成為罪惡、且法國解散共產黨、逮捕國會共產黨議員、或英國限制政治自山、壓迫印度民族之舉動、亦何能謂為維護民主之戰爭、</p>
<h3>維護民治為護身符　英法實為爭覇而戰</h3>
<p>「由此觀之、目前歐洲大戰之目的决非如英法官方宣言所公佈、决非為維獲民主、而另有此輩紳士所不願坦白宣佈者在、英法對德之戰爭既非因英法曾宣誓恢復波蘭、亦非為維護民主、彼英法統治階級此次作戰、自有其動機壯動機亦與思想無關、而在彼廣大殖民帝國之物質利益、大英帝國本土僅人口四千七百萬、而擁有人口四萬八千萬之殖民地、法蘭西殖民帝國本土僅四千二百萬人、而殖民地則有人口七千萬、英法擁有如此廣大殖民地、便能剝削數萬之人民、乃其世界覇權之基礎、然德國因凡爾賽和的崩潰、近來國力日益增强、對此殖民地頗思染指、此即英法對德戰爭之基本原因、英法統治階級惟恐喪失世界覇權、方决計對德作戰、</p>
<p>「如上所述、此决戰爭之帝國主義性質巳屬顯然、任何人苟面對現實、巳不能吾認此點、而此種爭奪世界覇權之戰爭、對於何人有利更屬顯明、對於工人階級决無利益可言、對於工人階級、此戰爭惟有犧牲與痛苦、由此、「侵略」及「侵略者」等術語之意義、最近是吾已有變更、諸君當能自行判斷、諸君當能洞悉苟仍以蘇德政治關係未生變化、歐洲帝國主義大戰未發生前之舊意義應用此類術語、其結果必將造成民心中之紛亂而引致錯誤之結論、為避免此點、吾人不能對於舊術語採無批判的態度、因其不適用於新國際局勢、</p>
<h3>賡續採取中立　助德謀致和平</h3>
<p>「以上所述乃最近國際事件之經過、以下余將概述蘇聯本身國際地位之變更、此項變更非常重大、吾人將指出者僅最重耍的各點、竟因一貫推行和平外交政策之故、業使吾國國際地位大有增强、余前已述及吾國與德國邦交之根本改進、兩國邦交方循親善睦鄰、展開實際合作、在政治上援助德國和平運動之路綫而發展、蘇德互不侵犯公的規定吾國在德國作戰時應維持中立、吾人曾一貫推行此路綫、即九月十七日吾軍開入前波蘭領土、亦與此路綫不相衝突、且吾政府於同日曾通牒凡有外交關係之各國、聲明蘇聯將繼續在對各該國之關係上採取中立政策、吾軍之開入波蘭領土、係在波蘭國家瓦解之後、因波蘭旣已瓦解、吾人即遭遇本國安全有關之問題、吾人當然不能中立無覩、而吾烏克蘭及白俄羅斯西部同胞因波蘭瓦解而被委諸天命、吾政府允不能坐視不問、「此後之事件、證實蘇德新邦交之基礎至為堅實、雖紅軍開入波蘭後發生劃分兩國利益範圍之重大問題、然此問題立由雙方同意迅速解决、而九月底蘇德友好劃界條的簽定後、兩國邦交乃更，臻鞏固、</p>
<p>「過去二十年來、德國與西歐各資產階級國家間關係、主要在德國努力擺脫凡爾賽和的束縛的奮鬥支配之下、而此和的之作俑者則為英法兩國、美國亦曾參加、此為今日發生歐戰之遠因、至蘇德邦交之基礎則截然不同、蘇聯對於維持戰後之凡爾賽體系、實無利益可言、吾人且曾一貫主張强大的德國、方為歐洲持久和平之必要條件、人苟以為德國可被消滅、使不載於典籍、則未免滑稽可笑、作此愚夢之强國顯已忘却凡爾賽之可嘆經騐、不認識德國之國力日增、不知在目前與一九一四年不同、國際局勢下企圖再現凡爾賽、其結果將使彼等自食其禍、「吾人曾一貫努力改進對德邦交、亦歡迎德方之同樣努力、今此邦交已立於敦睦親善之基礎上、吾人志願支持德國覓取和平之努力、同時並願協力發展兩國經濟關係、使雙方均蒙其利、自兩國政治關係改進後、經濟關係亦大有進步、最近德國代表團在莫斯科及目前吾國代表團在德國進行之談判、正為蘇德貿易之發展建立廣大基礎、</p>
<h3>佔領波蘭領土　誇張軍事勝利</h3>
<p>「余將續談關於吾軍開入前波蘭領土之一切、關於此事之經過母庸細述、因諸君於報上早巳見及、余僅將最重要者、當波蘭瓦解之時、吾政府不得不援助烏克蘭及白俄羅斯西部同胞、此無待於證明、紅軍開入兩區之後、深受人民歡迎、彼等認吾軍為助其擺脫波蘭豪紳地主資本家桎梏之解放者、在一部份地域、紅軍曾與波軍發生大戰、結果頗有死傷、其數目如下、「在白俄羅斯前綫、紅軍官兵共戰死二百四十六名、傷五百〇三名、死傷共七百四十九名、在烏克蘭前錢、官兵戰死四百九十一名、傷一千三百五十九名、死傷共一千八百五十名、兩區統計共戰死傷七百三十七名、一千八百六十二名、死傷共二千五百九十九名、吾軍在波蘭奪得戰利品有大砲九百餘尊機關槍一萬餘挺、步槍三十餘萬桿、步槍彈一萬五千餘萬粒、砲彈一百餘萬枚、飛機的三百架、併入蘇聯之領土與歐洲某一大國面積相等、計西白俄羅斯十萬〇八千方公里、人口四百八十萬、西烏克蘭几萬八千方公里、人口八百萬、兩區總計面積十九萬六千方公里、人口的一千三百萬、內七百餘萬為烏克蘭人、三百餘萬為白俄人、百餘萬為波蘭人、百餘萬為猶太人、</p>
<p>「上述事件之政治意義至為重大、西烏克蘭及西白俄羅斯兩地發來報吿、均稱人民一致熱烈歡迎民族解放及蘇維埃制度之勝利、最近兩地有史以來第一次之普遍直接平等秘密投票選舉國民大會經過、證明其人民十分之九早願加入蘇聯、勒伏夫及貝洛斯多克舉行之國民大會、證明全體人民代表關於一切政治問題、意見均完全一致、</p>
<h3>對波海三小國　允不干涉內政</h3>
<p>「余將再論吾人與波羅的海各國之關係、在此方面亦已發生重大變化、過去吾國對愛沙尼亞·拉特維亞及立陶宛之邦交、係以一九二〇年與各該國締結之和平條的為基礎、三國因此諸的而成獨立國、由彼至今、蘇聯對彼等實推行友好政策、此與帝俄壓迫弱小民族不准有獨立的民挨的及政治的發展、使彼等深感怨恨之政策大不相同、二十年來蘇聯與三國之邦交經過、業已造成進一步改善政治及其他關係之有利條件、因此、最近在莫斯科與三國代表陸續談判結果、業巳分別締結互助公的、此諸的政治意義甚大、其原則完全相同、均為締的國雙方之互助、包括諸國被攻擊時軍事援助在內、「該三國地理位置特殊、實為蘇聯在波羅的海方面之門戶、此諸公的簽定後、蘇聯得在愛沙尼亞及拉特維亞兩國指定地點、設立海軍根據地及飛行塲、而在立陶宛則得共同防衛該國疆界、此諸海軍根據地及飛行塲及派駐各該處加以保護之定額紅軍、不但足以保障蘇聯邊疆、並將保障各該波羅的海國家、因而對於和平之維持及人民之利益亦屬有利、吾人與三國之談判、證明雙方對於軍事保障相互利益之必耍、均有互信及認識、並說明雙方均志願維持和平、及保護從事和平運動的民衆之安全、正因此故、此諸富有重大歷史意義之互助公的談判方能成功、「此諸公的之含義、非為蘇聯干涉愛·拉·立·三國之內政、如某某外國報紙所妄稱、正相反、各公的均切實聲明締的國主權不可侵犯、及相互不干涉內政之原則、公的相互尊重對方之政治社會及經濟制度、而其目的則為增强雙方人民之和平親善合作、吾人對於各公的、將根據相互原則切實邀守、吾人宜言一切關於波羅的海各國蘇維埃化之誹語、均為吾共同敵人及反蘇份子之挑撥伎倆、吾國自與三國改進政治關係後、對於彼等之經濟需要、亦會給與滿足、最近又會與彼等分別簽定商務條的、從而吾國對各該國之貿易將增數倍、以後尙有續增之可能、「値茲所有歐洲國家連中立國在內、均感受貿易困難之際、吾國與波羅的海三國所簽經濟協定、對於各該國實至重要、因此、蘇聯與愛沙尼亞·拉得維亞·及立陶宛之重修和好、將使農業工業運輸等之進展更為神速、且為波羅的海隣國人民造福利、</p>
<p>蘇聯對小國之政策可自交還維爾諾城與立陶宛共和國之協定中、獲得極有力之說明、由於該協定之成立、此擁有二百五十萬人口之立陶宛國家已擴充其土地、人口增加五十五萬、同時並牧還維爾諾城、而該城人口幾倍於目前立陶宛京城、蘇聯同意將維爾諾城交還立陶宛、並非因該城大部份均係立國民衆、事實上維爾諾城之大部份民衆、均非立陶宛人民、蘇聯方面所加以考慮者、係此由波蘭武力攫去之城、應仍為立陶宛一城市、該城與立國之過去歷史、以及立陶宛之熱望、均有密切關係、國外報紙均指出、此種由大國自動將大城市交還小國之事實、世界歷史中尙未有前例因此、蘇聯此舉已充分表現其善意、</p>
<h3>對芬關係特殊　有關本國安全</h3>
<p>吾人與芬蘭之關係極為特殊、此係由於第三强國在芬蘭之强大勢力、但公正人士均應承認之、關於蘇聯之安全（允其是列寗格勒）問題、前在蘇羅談話中曾亦提及、而在目前蘇芬談判中、亦將有所檢討、就某種意義而言、此項關於蘇聯安全之關係極為尖銳化、蓋列寗格勒除莫期科外、為蘇聯最重要之城市、而該城之位置、距離芬蘭邊境僅得三十二公里、換言之、列寗格勒與外國邊境距離之短、現代之大砲巳可轟及、在另一方面、芬蘭至列寗格勒之海道距離亦極近、因此芬蘭對蘇聯之態度、是吾親善抑或敵對、極為重要、查芬蘭現擁有芬蘭海灣北岸全部及芬蘭海灣中部之各島嶼、</p>
<p>鑒於上述情形、以及目前歐洲之局勢、芬蘭可望表現應有之諒解、在過去數年中、蘇芬關係之基礎何在乎、誠如爾等所知、此項關係之基礎、係一九二〇年時成立之和平協定、其性質與吾人與其他波羅的海鄰國所簽者雷同、蘇聯自動的保證葬蘭之獨立生存、無疑的、祗有認識民族自由發展原則之蘇聯、方有此種舉動、同時亦唯有蘇聯政府始敢容忍近在列寗格勒門戶之芬蘭維持獨立、關於此點、可由芬蘭自「克令司基」及「切里脫力」「民主政府」所獲經騐加以證明、至于里凡夫及密里哥夫之政府以及帝俄政府更無論矣、毫無疑問的、此種重要之環境、將成為改善蘇芬關係之極好基礎、至于對于和平之關切、芬蘭並不下于蘇聯、最近之蘇芬談判、係由吾等所發動、該項談判之主題為何、歐洲中心各大國正在醞釀最可怕之戰爭、在此種國際形勢下、蘇聯唯有採取嚴厲辦法、藉以保障其安全、關于此點、芬蘭海灣以及陸地距離列寗格勒旣極接近、則蘇聯之特別注意、亦為情理之事、</p>
<h3>認要求為合理　希望芬蘭諒解</h3>
<p>列寗格勒之人口現已增至百三五十萬、幾等於全芬之三百六十五萬人口、關於蘇芬談判國外報紙所散佈之故事、殊無加</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>以討論之必要、某某報竟謂蘇聯耍求維波里城及拉杜加湖之北部、此係純粹之謊言、又某報稱蘇聯要求芬方割讓埃倫特島、此亦純屬捏造、同時外間更有蘇聯對瑞典及挪威之要求等諫言、此種謠言之荒謬、殊無加以辯正之必要、事實上、吾人向芬蘭提出之建議極為公允、且此種建議亦為保證蘇聯安全及維持蘇芬關係之最低限度辦法、吾人業已開始與芬國遣來之代表巴錫基維等談判、吾人曾向彼等建議簽訂蘇芬互助公的、其性質與吾人與其他波羅的海國家所成立之互助協定雷同、但芬蘭政府既聲明此項協定將影響其中立、吾人亦未堅持、吾人旋進行討論關於蘇聯安全（尤其是列寗格勒）問題、吾人建議成立一種協定、將蘇芬在加里利亞地峽之邊境、移至列寗格勒北百公里地點、其交換條件為吾人將蘇維埃加里利亞一部份移交芬蘭、查蘇維埃加里利亞地面之大、幾倍於芬蘭所讓與蘇聯者、</p>
<p>同時、吾人並向芬蘭建議成立一種協定、規定芬蘭將芬蘭海灣一小部份、在固定期內租與蘇聯、俾蘇方可在該地建立海軍根據地、根據蘇愛互助協定、蘇聯旣在芬蘭海灣南部（即波羅的海口岸）設立海軍根據地、則在芬蘭灣北部設立根據地、必可保證全芬蘭海灣、使其不致受外來之敵對侵略、吾人確信該項海軍根據地之設立、非特蘇聯即芬蘭亦必蒙其利益、至于吾人其他建議、尤其是關于芬蘭灣某某島及里巴區與史萊特尼半島交換蘇維埃加里利亞（後者較前者之地面幾大一倍）之建議、芬蘭方面巳不加以反對、但其他相差意見、則仍未能解決、芬方現雖巳同意讓出加里利地峽一部份、惟仍無補于事、同時吾人已採取新步驟、藉以獲得解決途徑、吾人已聲明、苟吾人之主要建議巳為芬方所接受、則吾人將不復反對埃倫特島之設防、吾人祗提出一項條款、即設防挨倫特島應由芬蘭本身進行、絕不能有第三國（包括蘇聯在內）參加、吾人更建議芬蘭、請求解除蘇芬邊境之防禦工事、（在加里利亞地峽）並聲明此項舉動必將裨益芬蘭國家、</p>
<p>吾人同時並聲明吾人對于將蘇芬不侵犯條的另加互助保證條款之希望、最後、蘇芬政治關係之鞏固、必將成為兩國經濟關係進展之基礎、由是觀之、吾人對于芬蘭所注意各點、均凖備與之謀一解決、因此吾人殊不信芬蘭政府將覓尋某種藉口、而阻撓目前所建議之協定的成立、蓋此種舉動、實違反蘇芬友誼關係、且對芬蘭之危害亦極鉅大、吾人深信芬蘭領袖必能認識鞏固蘇芬友誼關係之必要、而芬蘭民衆亦必能拒絕反蘇勢力及煽動、</p>
<h3>美國出而干涉　譏其未免多事</h3>
<p>「關於蘇芬談判、美總統現亦竟實行干涉、此實不符美國之中立政策、十月十二日羅斯福總統會以電文致最高蘇維埃主席加里寗、希望蘇芬之友誼關係能加以維持、並向前發展、此項電文、使人相信美國與菲列賓及古巴之關係、較諸蘇芬關係為佳、實則菲島要求獨立而未得准許、而芬蘭則早巳獲得自由與獨立矣、加里寗同志當即復電羅斯福先生、電云、「余謹請貴總統注意蘇聯早已於一九一七年十二月三十一日承認芬蘭之政治獨立、而芬蘭主權已在一九二〇年十月十日俄羅斯邦與芬方成立之和平協定中、獲得保障、蘇聯此項舉動、巳說明蘇聯對蘇芬關係基本原則、目前蘇芬進行之談判、即係根據該項基本原則、其唯一目的、即為鞏固兩國之關係、並增强雙方合作、共為兩國安全努力」「最高蘇維埃主席團主席旣有如此明白之答復、芬蘭政府應接受吾人之建議、查吾人之建議、為最低限度之辦法、非特無害於芬蘭之國家利益、且將增强其安全、使芬方可與吾人成立關於經濟及政治關係更强大中基礎、</p>
<h3>土取危險路綫　行將噬臍莫及</h3>
<p>吾人與土耳共進行之談判、其中甚少可提出報吿、關於此項談判、國外有極多之謠言、某方竟調蘇聯要求土耳其劃讓阿特干與寇爾斯、此種謠言純屬揑造、又其他方面傳蘇聯要求更改在蒙得婁成立之國際條的、並要求在海峽方面獲得有利地位、「此亦為揑造之妄語、實際上所討論者為締結、以黑海及海峽區域為限的雙面互助公的之問題、蘇聯認定第一、此公的之締結不得使蘇聯捲入與德國發生武力衝突之行動、第二、蘇聯欲得下列保證、即戰爭威脅發生時、土耳其不得准許非黑海國之戰艦通過博斯坡魯斯海峽開入黑海、土耳其拒絕此兩條件、因而公約之締結遂不可「蘇土談判未能簽定公的、但至少足以闡明吾人所欲知之數項政治問題、在目前國際局勢下、認識吾人與有重大關係之國家之眞面目及政策特別重要、關於土國之政策、許多部份吾人今巳洞悉、不但由於莫斯科談判、允其由於最近土政府之外交行動、土政府之決定使該國命運與目前大戰中歐洲「肯定交戰團體」相連繫、即與兩月來對德作戰之英法簽定互助公的、如此土國巳肯定放棄慎重中立政策、加入擴大歐戰之是非圈、此舉自為努力儘量勾引中立國家加入彼等作戰方面之英法兩國所欣幸、將來土耳其是吾後悔、吾人將不加預測、吾人僅必須記取吾鄰國外交政策之新因素、而對事件之發展密切注意而巳、</p>
<p>「土國旣已在某種程度上、決採支持某一交戰團體之危險路綫、其政府顯然自知其由此擔負之責任、蘇聯之外交政策則不如是、而結果過去在外交上且有不少成功、今後蘇聯立將置身局外而繼續一貫推行中立政策、不但不助使戰爭擴大、且將努力支持恢復和平之運動、吾人深信吾國一貫和平政策今後亦必得有良果、吾人在黑海區域亦將推行此政策、而深信必能保證其對於蘇聯利益、以及對於與蘇聯願望諧洽之各國之利益、均能正常適應、</p>
<h3>改進蘇日邦交　視日誠意如何</h3>
<p>「嗣為吾人與日本之關係、最近蘇日邦交有某種改進、此項改進之微兆、於近頃莫斯科簽字之停止蒙「滿」邊境衝突協定可以見之、本年五月起直至九月中旬、日「滿」軍與蘇蒙軍在「滿蒙邊界之諾蒙亨區歷有衝突、期內各種兵器包括飛機及重砲均曾使用、戰事有時至為劇烈、衝突之起因、乃緣日本企圖奪取蒙古人民共和國之一部份領土、武力改變「滿」蒙疆界、此種片面行動方法、必然引起斷然反抗、其施於蘇聯及其同盟國之完全無益、今巳再得證明、不幸的波蘭之命運雖證明歐洲某某强國簽定之互助公的如何不可靠、然蒙邊發生之事實、則證明蘇聯所簽互助公的之價値如何、「此衝突業於九月十五日之蘇日協定在莫斯科簽字後停止、邊界和平已完全恢復、由此蘇日邦交改進已經過第一步、其第二步為組織蘇蒙及日「滿」代表共同委員會、進行審查關於邊界之某某爭執問題、茍對方亦有誠意、將來必有良好結果、</p>
<p>「此外、蘇日商務談判亦有開始之可能、蘇日貿易之發展、於雙方均屬有利、粽上所述吾人可有理由宣言吾國與日本邦交之改進業已開始、此傾向發展迅速程度如何、吾人尙難斷言、吾人不知日方之準備程度如何、就吾人言之、吾人對於日方之此類游說、當表歡迎、而吾人將根據本國基本政治立塲及對於和平之關心以與之接近、</p>
<h3>指斥英美政策　足以延長戰爭</h3>
<p>「最後、余將就關於戰爭違禁品及中立國輸出軍械與交戰國之問題、略述數語、日前蘇聯曾致文英國、答復其九月六日及十一日之節略、原文均經公佈、我方節略說明吾國對於戰爭違禁品問題之意見、聲明蘇聯政府不承認食物、非戰鬥人民用燃料及衣服為戰爭違禁品、而認定禁止輸出民衆消費品、實等於强陷婦孺老弱於飢寒困苦、蘇聯政府並宣言、此類問題不能由英國片面、而必須各國共同同意决定、吾人期望各中立國及英法兩國奧論均認識吾人立塲之公正、而設法防止交戰國軍隊間之戰爭、變為屠殺老弱婦孺之戰爭、</p>
<p>「總而言之、吾國作為中立國實不願戰爭擴大、因而採取一切步驟、使戰爭之破壞較輕、結束較早、從而求取和平、自此點觀之、美國政府取消軍火輸往交戰國禁令之决定、不免使人發生疑慮、此决定之影響、顯不能使戰爭减輕、促其早日結束、正相反、將使其更加嚴重及延長、此决定對於美國軍火工業自有巨利、但此豈足為美國開放軍火禁令之理由、當然不能、「如上所述、即為目前之國際形勢以及蘇聯外交政策之原則」、（一日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>戰時歐洲進行曲（續）　倫敦特約通信　叔棣</h3>
<p>希特拉到底以怎樣的佈置，心情估計，和决意，來採取這樣重大的，出了常軌之外的舉措呢？</p>
<p>如果蘇聯是資本主義國家，那末，毫無疑問的，希特拉是在決意着，和蘇聯「瓜分」波蘭的領土。然而，蘇聯却是一個社會主議機構的國家，根本沒有攫取殖民地的必要。尤其，像波蘭東半部那樣窮乏似的領土，假如蘇聯收為己用，而又不採取帝國主義與殖民地間的剝削關係時，那末，在牠，倒是一個大大的負祖。還有，在這一决的「蘇德協定」的默契裏，如果已經完全兩方確定把波蘭劃成兩部，一部歸德，一部歸蘇時，那末，希特拉已經胸有成竹，不必為未來蘇·德·的關係担心了，因而，也就可以用了兵。可是，前面第（二）節裏，我巳經說過了，蘇·德·之問，這一次，對於波蘭，僅僅有很含渾的一個默契，那是：無論如何，兩國之間，一定留下一條緩衝地帶，然而，對於具體界限，却並無默契。即使以目下歐洲謠言這樣多的情形下，我們也倒沒有聽到關於蘇·德·未來在波蘭緩衝地域的具體疆界。——這是非常可注意的一點。</p>
<p>上段所說的兩種「如果」假設情形，倘若是存在著的話，那末，我們立刻可以斷定：希特拉的進攻波蘭，完全是由於蘇·德·協定的促成。可是，正因為這兩種情形，是不存在的，所以，希特拉這一回的行動，更有深究的必要。</p>
<p>實際的情形，倒是：與其說是希特拉為了「蘇德協定」的簽字，而忽然起意，進攻波蘭，倒不如說，為了要進攻波蘭，所以簽字於「蘇德恊定」要是畫一個簡明的公式來表明，我想，是可以這麼順着先後次序畫的：——</p>
<p>蘇·德·開始緩衝談判。當時目標，在德國方面，是企圖拆散英·法·蘇·談判；在蘇聯方面，是作為萬一對英·法·談判失敗時的第二步驟，同時，是藉以促進對英·法·同盟的早日完成。波蘭的問題，在當時，並不是蘇·德·談判的對象。波蘭問題擴大了，希特拉決意進攻波蘭。趁着英法·蘇·談判的失敗，巳本加緊了對蘇的秘密談判。以戲劇性的速度·里本特洛甫到莫斯科正式簽字於互不侵犯協定。最後，逼波蘭屈服，德國作最後的猶豫。德國開始進攻。</p>
<p>這個公式裏的第一階段，大概佔了好幾個月，並沒有什麼進展，後面的五個階段的發生時期，大概不到兩個月。我再附註一句：與第二階段同時進行着的，還有意大利與波蘭間的不斷接洽。因為這一點，對於「蘇德協定」及「德國進攻波蘭」這兩件事之間的關係上，有着很密切的關聯，在我們硏究這兩件事之間的關係時，不得不把牠放在心上。</p>
<p>這眞是一個萬分複雜的情勢！一個不留神，第一，固然可以不目覺地受了一方面宣傳的蒙蔽，其决，因為文字的運用不到，反而混淆了情勢。我奢望，我這幾段簡略叙述，可以避免這兩個缺點，但，我自己也沒有把握，不知是吾已經達到。</p>
<p>不管怎樣，德國巳經進攻波蘭了。現在再回到「進攻波蘭」這事件的本身。</p>
<p>「進攻彼蘭」這件事，在含義上，是方面非常多，內容萬分複雜的一件事。事前沒有同等最週密的估計，最大的決心，希特拉絕不會冒這一個大險。</p>
<p>首先，我們先得說；直到英·法·對德宣戰前為止，希特拉還在期待着波蘭對德的投降。德國的計算是在波蘭東面，牠已替牠摘去了最大的可靠援助。，在南面，牠以非常迅速的手段，在墨索車尼的協助下，巳經取得了巴爾幹半島各國的完全中立：現在，波蘭在地理形勢上，是三面受敵的，陷進了德國　聞之中。而西歐的英·法·援助短時期內，是絕對不可能的。在這種形勢下，德國計算着，當波蘭軍事上受到一兩個重大打擊時，逼牠投降，是完全可能的。所以，意大利沒有參戰。這就是說，在德·波·已經開了火的時候，同時，德·波·間的外交，因了意大利這一個側門，而仍在機續通行着。</p>
<p>到寫着這一段的今天，英·法·早經宜了戰，這一個德國的估計，巳經完全落了空。這在外交運用上說，希特拉可算是巳經受了一個敗挫。不過，為了明白整個情勢演變計，對於萬一波蘭就此投降時的德國欲望，還有追述的必要。假如波蘭投降的話，大前提，當然是接受所謂「十六條款」，其决，是取消「英·波·互助協定」和「法·波·互助條的」，再其决，是波蘭加入德·意·西·集團，合起來和英·法·對抗。如果這一個企圖實現，那末，要不了很久，德·意·對英·法·的殖民地要求，又會重行再提了出來，對英國的反動派，再用進攻蘇聯那一套去誘他們上圈套。換句話說，除了德·意·實力又增大了一决外，歐洲外交局面，多多少少，又會恢復了舊觀。</p>
<p>為了這個計劃，而在拚命地替德國出着力的，是意大利外長齊亞諾。</p>
<p>這是德國最理想的結局。要是替牠起名字的話，大概可以是：「略戰而勝」。</p>
<p>然而，英·法·終於宜了戰。對於這，在希特拉決定對波用兵時，他也有着相當預期和準備的。這就是說，德國還得把這一篇未了的文章，繼續向下面做去。</p>
<p>在這個第二階段裏，放在希特拉面前的難題，一共有三個；第一，對波妥協的幻想破了後，接着而出現的，是怎樣在最短期間內，確實地澈底擊敗波蘭軍隊。這是說，配備相當好，訓練相當精，人數在一百五十萬左右的波蘭軍隊，在希特拉希望任何其他步驟前，必得予以解決。第二，英·法。參戰後，德國對於西戰塲上應付的問題，第三，對蘇聯的關係問題。</p>
<p>現在我們知道，對於英·法·的參戰，德國現在決定，德國在西戰塲，採取完全守勢，大槪牠的「喜福來德」防錢，是相當的堅固，要是攻破牠，是相當困難的。同時，我們又知道，牠這一道防綫，比起法國的「馬其諾」防綫來，要長得多；意思是說，德國對法國，可以避免「馬其諾」防錢，而由比利時突進法國；法國呢，要得避免「喜福來德」防綫，那末，突進德國的唯一途徑，是假道瑞士，可是這裏有着羽拉山脈的天然障碍，話雖如此，這一回的把重兵調往東綫，事實上，是冒着相當危險的。當然大前提，他是不相信夾·法·會大規模進攻；其次，他還有別一個法寶，那就是意大利的沒有參戰。英·法·為免避了引起意大利的參戰，大概是不會大規模進攻的。（希特拉這樣估計着）可是另有個非常明顯的事實，法國如果假道瑞士去攻德國，那末，毫無疑問，一定會剌惱了墨索里尼，至於在「喜福來德」與「馬其諾」面對面之間，無論怎樣大規模的戰事，希特拉是準備應付的。剩下來的問題，是英國的海軍封鎖，在這一點上，首先又是意大利的沒有參戰，英國的封鎖，無論怎樣，不能完全，地中海上，意大利各港口，就是德國物品原料的漏洞：其次，對波戰爭，是一個陸地和天空的戰鬥，與海軍沒有大關係。德國海上對英·法·的戰事，一起始，牠就採取了失敗主議，根本不存什麼幻想了。唯一的對策，是潛水艇，搗亂而已。</p>
<p>對於蘇聯的未來關係，是令希特拉最頭痛的事。當然，一向把進攻「共產主義」嚷着是天賦予的使命，把自己喧傳為挽救世界於「布爾什維克」之手的他，到現在，却要翻過臉來，向凱來木林宮去扮笑臉，這，誠然是不是什麼十分舒服的心境。不過，比起道誇大狂式的自尊心受挫折來，卻有另一個確實令他發愁的事；那是，萬一對波戰爭擴大而延長後，蘇聯態度的問題。老實不客氣，萬一戰事延長，蘇聯是有直接或間接參戰可能的。換句話說，萬一戰事擴大而延長下去，德國頗有被逼草草結束對波戰爭的趨勢：兩害相權取其輕，在一個對波屈服與劉蘇戰爭之間，那一條路上算，那時候，祇要聰明一點的人，都是可以知道的，何況希特拉要想免去被迫進那個十字路口的窘境，唯一的有效一著，就是趕快徹底解決波蘭；另一面，再繼續地，把那對莫斯科扮着的笑臉，更加扮了下去。（未完）</p>

<p>蘇省敎育經費、原極充裕、二十六年度之省敎費支出預算、計教育行政費三四六·七四四元、高等敎育費四三六·八〇八元、普通敎育費三·一七四·三一三元、社會敎育費四七一·〇六〇元、留學經費一〇〇·〇〇〇元、補助費一五三·六〇〇元、推行義敎費七五〇·〇〇〇元、各項臨時費七一三·二九〇元、償還債務費二五六·〇〇〇元、合計六·四〇一·八一五元、數目可謂相當鉅大、迨至二十七年以後、江南各縣大多淪陷、乃陷於極端困難之境、二十七年上半年、省敎專款收入、統計三十一縣、收入以叫折計算、約計不過三四七·六六一元、二十七年份支出項下、除敎育行政費外、上半年為二六八·一四四元、下半年為九八·四一六元、二十八年度預算亦未能有所增加、其竭蹶之狀、蓋亦不難想見、此則不能不賴於中央之補助、</p>
<p>各縣敎費</p>
<p>至於縣敎費方面、在二十六年度各縣敎費頂算總數為一一·二二〇·八六一元、二十六年十月閒雖因戰局緊張、各縣敎育行政事業費、以八折發放、而普義社敎費仍照舊例支、未加核减、二十七年春、各縣普義社敎費、亦仍照原預算例支、如地方財政困難時、再斟酌情形减成發放、關於各縣敎育局行政事業費另編緊縮頂算、二十七年下半年、各縣敎費頂算、又重編緊縮預算一决、二十七年度計共緊縮兩次、</p>
<p>整頓計劃</p>
<p>省敎廳以敎費如此竭蹶、在目前抗戰過程中、惟有力求收支適合與自給自足、業巳統盤籌劃、在支出方面首重節流、次則整頓收入、關於節流方面、如力求省縣敎費頂算收支適合省縣敎費頂算厲行緊縮、確定淪陷區敎費收支原則、限制新興事業及修建購置、關於整頓收入方面、如清查學產、整飭學租、確定敎費徵收標準、清理省縣敎育機關經費財產、皆所以在收支適合與自給自足之目標下力謀補救、以免今後敎育經費枯竭之危機也、</p>
<h3>民衆敎育館的回顧與前瞻（三）</h3>
<p>— 陳禮江</p>
<p>二、今後的展望</p>
<p>今後的途徑民衆敎育館的困難和缺點、已如上述、我們應常針對着道些困難和缺點、積極的設法去克制和補救、自不能因噎廢食、畏難而退、民衆敎育館這種敎育機關、極適宜於文化稈度低落敎育經費拮据的我國、因為在文化程度低落敎育經費拮据的國家、一方面沒有大宗的款子來舉辦各種單獨設置的敎育機關、他方面乃由於民衆在實際生活上、需要普通敎育的程度更較專門敎育為急切、再一面就是這種綜合的設施、乃是集合各種事業而成、其敎育功效、自比較單獨設置為有力量、同時又係民衆敎育實施的中心、當然力量比分散的設施為大、更可避免分設的種種弊端、我以為今後的民衆敎育館、應採取下列的途徑、</p>
<p>（一）民衆敎育館的主要目的、不是辦館、乃是辦民衆敎育、敎育民衆、以引發他們對於人生的新認識、對於社會的新觀念、以創造新人生、創造新社會、換言之、民衆敎育館的對象是「人」不是「物」、辦館而不辦敎育、乃是「教物」而不「敎人」、這是我們應當引以為戒的、</p>
<p>（二）民衆敎育館的各項設施、須因人·因事·因時·因地而制宜、不能過分規定一種固定的形式、因此、敎部只訂了工作大綱、各省市敎育廳局、應當根據工作大綱、訂立各該省市民衆敎育館中心工作及其細目、各民衆敎育館應當根據中心工作及其細目、訂定各該館事業進行計劃和工作月歷、</p>
<p>（三）民衆敎育館的施敎方法、應以組織民衆訓練民衆為最高原則、將一切敎育均附麗於民衆組織訓練之中、使其在團體生活中獲得堅强的團結力、及為羣衆謀幸福的精神、這樣才能使民衆組織訓練發生力量、使敎育與民衆生活打成一片、</p>
<p>（四）民衆敎育館的內部組織、在經費不甚充足的縣市立民衆敎育館、不必四組全設、應求工作的方便、甚至就設敎導一組、亦未嘗不可、切忌囚組織而妨礙事業的發展、</p>
<p>（五）民衆敎育館的工作人員、關係極其重要、民衆敎育館的成敗得失、和制度固有關係、但其主體則在工作人員、故愼選人員、乃是整頓及振發民衆敎育館的唯一出路、愼選的時候、要注意其人格·精神·信仰·熱忱、旣選定之後、要注意其工作的考核及進修、則所辦事業、自能蒸蒸日上、</p>
<p>（六）民衆敎育館的經費數額、就大體說、每館每年至少要有兩千元、經費不甚充裕的地方、應將圖書館體育塲……這一類社敎機關、合併於民衆敎育館、設備方面、中央及省敎育行政機關、應儘量設法補助、進一步說、理想的民衆敎育館、應當是一個生產機關、能够自足自給、</p>
<p>（七）民衆敎育館並不是萬能的機關、同時社會之大、以我們這一點人力及經費、實在亦萬能不了、所以、我們要希望其有成效、必須多在聯絡及利用上注意、聯絡乃是表示合作、利用乃是借用他力、對己對人、均有裨益、同時須知我們的目的乃是為謀民衆的福利、社會的促進、只求能達到這個目的、縱使任勞任怨、有些犧牲、亦是值得的、尤要者、合作時不要貪功、借用他力時不要魯莽滅裂、自可收莫大的贊助、</p>
<p>（八）民衆敎育館最後的歸宿點、乃在使之成為民衆的敎育館、民衆自有的敎育館、故各種工作、應盡量在培植民衆的自動能力及精神上注意、使共能自立·自助·自治·自辦、庶幾這種事業、纔能眞正使其成為民衆自有的事業、</p>
<p>如果能照上述途徑去做、我敢說、民衆敎育館、不單是一種改造舊敎育創造新敎育的合理制度、而且是改造舊社會創造新社會的主動力量、</p>

<h3>金融　港帮不時拋售外滙</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌各匯皆平、英美匯暗市、因十底安渡、美銀行出英扒美、套做美英匯兌、港方及猶太商又來拋塞、因之趨勢、復歸盤旋、半天過程、仍處於鬆疲之境、其勢雖不易捉換、但咸信滙價最近期內不致有急劇之變動、換言之、即上落範圍、祗限於五辦士內外而巳、晨開微軟、英金緊〇一五六二五、美匯縮〇三一二五、嗣因港電不時向市拋塞、並猶太商喬直甫亦拋出本月份先令、且以外行進胃不振、致為狀不支、即轉鬆動、最硬英金曾喊五辦士一二五、美匯亦喊過八元半、旋為匯豐見賤乘機吸納、市勢始回、結果以五辨士〇七八一二五、及八元四三七五收盤、比上日英鬆〇六二五、美賤〇九三七五、至本月份期貨交易談論尙有、市况與現貨不分榮辱、半天交易尙旺、</p>

<h3>金市黯無生氣　收盤為三千六百九十元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、好景不常、又淪於賣風四起之中、買戶沒精打彩、殊形散漫、致終跌落三十五元、晨開承前晚餘風、再漲十五元為三千七百四十元、時外匯告軟、一度頗穩、但十時後忽趨鬆硬、此賣彼出、以證券帮及金號競塞最力、雖銀樓帮代查港帮及本帮一鼓作氣、吸進有數、無如頭寸上卒感充裕、故曾一度退達三千六百八十元低盤、午刻匯市已告稍平、空方亦巳獲利、急思補進、遂重出三千七百元關外、迨至午收為三千七百元、下午外匯無市、金市寂寞、初開仍為散多放出、徘徊至晚收為三千穴百九十元、中途變化極少、僅十二元上落、全天交易上午尙旺、而下午奇淸、共的千兩光景、銀樓飾金終日未更、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>粭赤跌三十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開外匯略軟、人氣尙佳、開市做高十五元、錢兌業進證券帮三十兩、為三千七百四十元、少項某金號拋出、立回落十五允、令號售予銀樓帮二十兩、為三千七百二十五元、時某證券帮代客收買、復漲起十五元、證券帮進金號五十兩、為三千七百四十元、此後外匯忽然轉硬、賣風叫起、金號與錢兌業及證券帮等競相塞出、雖銀樓帮進多出少、無如頭寸仍感充斥、立降落四十元、其時港帮雖限三千七百元買進、但為數不多、難以相敵續小二十元、證券帮售予錢兌業二十兩、為三千六百八十元、旋以外匯稍定、及某錢兌業吃胃陡健、遂回起二十五元、錢兌業互做三十兩、為三千七百〇五元、後因外匯復趨鬆硬、金號與證券帮賣風重起、遂再撳小至三千六百八十五元、將近收盤時、外匯回平、某余號頓來復進、回高三十元、金號互做五十兩、為一二千七百十五元、後因銀樓帮拋出重稍疲落、錢兌業吐予金號二十兩、為三千七百元作午收價、午後狀態平靜、初開做高二元、錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、為三千七百〇二元、後因錢兌業及某銀號多頭吐出、步降十二元、某銀號賣予錢兌業及證券帮共三十兩、為三千六百九十元作晚收價、結果比上日軋跌三十五元、全天六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十元、收進須减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、因烚赤無大上落、終日未史、大同行仍懸三百七十五元原價、新同行與上價相同、收進約减低十五元之譜、</p>
<p>十月份滙劃存息　每千元五元半</p>
<p>銀行業聯合準備委員會訂定十月份同業匯劃存款息、每千元為五元半、昨日巳通告各行查照矣、</p>
<p>貼現拆息均低</p>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、復見銳落、每千元之貼率巳低至四十元之內、晨初仍盤於四十三元左右、現鈔供過於求、故下退至午刻為四十元、下午續挫、至最後為三十九元、比前日軋跌叫元、錢業公會拆息續降二分、早午兩市均掛一角五分云、</p>
<p>英印銀止漲下降</p>
<p>三十一日倫敦電、銀市美商賣出、空戶稍補、少交易、市面平、收盤後平平、進戶知足、大條銀近遠期均縮一八七五、紐約銀電、美現貨未更、又孟買銀電、印銀市况平靜、現期俱小四安那、成交單祇二十張、</p>
<h3>證劵　外債飛勝　內債中好</h3>
<p>證券暗盤行市、初仍以多方出籠而冉略趨疲、繼以金子突高、併知國外公債趨漲、賣氣頓衰、市即轉佳、午後漲勢亦穩、環境消息沉悶、是以走勢幾隨外匯及金子漲跌為依歸、美日談判雖傳說甚盛、但尙在醞釀、此事關係於我國及公債之消長甚大、故公債趨勢或將因此而暫盤旋、咋日交易較遜、祇以做多者較衆、故傳說看好者居多、市氣受此影響者、亦頗有力、大戶稍一動辦、市價必隨之上升、上午初開平穩、稍稍疲落、後聯和及二十號吸收較多、市價頓為抬高、午後趨勢相同、丙種再穿出九元關、二十號及聯和等復有淮胃、市價乃堅定、結果回漲二角至五角半、成交總數的六七十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交浙江與業銀行股五十股、價為六十二元五角、</p>
<p>倫敦三十一日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市上落甚微、開平煤礦不記名股續升六便士、價為—六先令、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股回跌一鎊、價為七十七鎊古拉客林傍橡皮股跌落七便士、為十六先令三便士，其餘平平、</p>
<p>倫敦　十一日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、一致堅漲、行情上檔好起一鎊至五鎊、下檔亦漲一二鎊、上檔中法美金（有印）猛升五鎊、為卅五鎊、英法（英發）及善後（英發）各升三鎊、前者為三十三鎊、後者為二十九鎊、克利斯浦升二鎊半、為二十鎊、英德續（英發）及費克斯各升二鎊、前者為四十二鎊、後者為八鎊、下檔鐵路公債漲起二鎊者、為道淸及津浦、道淸新價為十二鎊、津浦（原續發及英發德發）均為十一鎊、其餘各漲一鎊、計湖廣非德發及德發）及京滬均為十二鎊、隴海及廣九均為十鎊、北寗不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市漲力不大</h3>
<p>紗市因連朝疲憊不振、近來西南方面雖無大量的需要、但零星交易漸顯活動之象、故人心又見安定、惜乎納胃未暢、故漲力甚微、同時英匯亦在五辦士關口、進進出出、市塲益呈寗謐之狀、就目前狀况測之大漲面暫時尙難發現、然劇烈之跌風、亦不致於發生也、因為原棉趨勢雖疲憊不振、然下挫程度既迂迥、而遠不及紗之烈、所以情况論之、紗市恐有畏期問之徘徊也、</p>
<p>晨初開盤、因上日午後為滙票改縮、人心復振、買戶尤濃、氣勢挺進、二十支雙馬開價為六百六十元、巳漲十五元、此時同業、雖有成交、然客帮價高不吃、一霎間回下十二元、跌進六百四十八元、原故謂滙票又復放長、入後漸漸回起幾元、在六百五十三四五允、上上下下、查半日間成交一千二百四十包、行情二十支雙馬漲十九元、天女漲十八元、廠方由永安廠開出二十支特金城一百二十五包、價為六百五十五元、崇信廠開出一二支大發一百五十包、價為六百十五元、今日有棉紗五百七十件運寗波、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<h3>棉銷稍形起色</h3>
<p>本棉因日紗廠昨有顯著活動採辦氣象、內外大康兩廠皆有需要、但額量未見龐大、市情尙在平靜之境、加之紗市飄盪不定、廠方心思淡泊、所以市價與上日無甚軒輊、蘇北來源略形减縮、碼頸上到通州花僅三百四十五包、又北方來一千八百六十包、茲將現棉售開之盤錄左、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來殊為靜寂、匯兌之放長、反使各業呆停、日廠商亦毫無進胃、祗有某同業在市搜購西印度一二百件、聞係抵解額子云云、同業間亦有擬訂購美棉者、惟深恐滙兌之再長、故將訂購美金塊角、藉此减低危險性也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初因同業交易較盛、市價尙稱堅定、海外來電購買、故棉價略漲、後因一部份反動者之賣出、及多頭獲利了結、市况轉疲、結果收盤價較之上日跌五至七磅音、印度連同預測漲二五羅比、埃及降十餘磅音、利物浦平、</p>
<h3>糧食　安秈緊俏杜埂尚平</h3>
<p>杜粳　米市目前日回跌午市又復轉緊後、昨開市絞穩、來源祇抵蘇嘉楓靑等各貨十四五車、數計二千餘包、本鄕作客均乘廉活動、兼之內地帮吸收江北杜尖、故尖市形勢曾一度緊俏、但一般作客穩抱非廉不取主義、對於吃盤仍未放鬆、故全市銷塲雖較前日為暢、市上窖種菉、種供過於求、呈疲態而繼貶半元左右、餘貨未有上落、統計做開常錫特粳及破粳、蘇同常崑高粳、靑角菉種、窰種野稻、松江百哥六種、新陳元等七千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈　前日鬆落後、昨市買氣又見活潑、本街鄕莊作客需胃均濃、而內地帮與囤戶尤見活潑、且以邇日積糧貯存備荒之說甚盛、行囤大戶均圖捷足吸收、故在昨日到頭擁擠之際、晨市反見上展、按昨日南京秈到有十三車江輪更有整批到下、總計有萬包以上、其中行號新到之八千包、因捐費浩大、尙不划成本、故按不出樣、日商祇有小批售出、且市上盛傳新到車輪及江北裝出者均遭意外之阻難、因此客秈售價一度漲三四角、旋有浮團售出、午後始見平落、</p>
<h3>小麥難以過漲　麺粉依然堅穩</h3>
<p>粉市依然堅穩、各廠因原料昂貴、對於大帮去化、售意仍堅、本街零批交易、亦祇日常需用而巳、統市成交的有三萬餘包、計開綠兵船牌七元四角、紅藍車及綠砲車七元五角、市上回籠貨籌碼甚枯、售手頗形堅俏、故行情提高數分至一角不等、</p>
<p>小麥來源不多、而市上存底、向被囤戶執住、未能充分供給、惟廠方對於高價之原料亦不願再為進取、故市面巳難過漲、統市由福新廠辦進六百包、囤戶方面做開七車、價與前市悉乏榮辱、</p>
<h3>雜糧　大連新黃豆　已有拋開</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、因大連新豆已有拋售、且訂三四天可以抵埠、人心轉定、交易亦淡、統市計開三四天交大連豆四車、價為十六元五角、太倉豆三百包、十四元五角至十四元四角、蕪湖豆一百五十包、十四元一角至二角、南京豆八十包、十四元、崇明沙黃一十包、十四元二角及十四元、浦東杜豆三十包、十六元二角、平湖豆二十包、十五元九角、又豆子昨有一百七十九包、由北沙運來、</p>
<h3>糖市　惠州白成交較旺</h3>

<h3>南北貨　黑木耳高貨挺秀</h3>
<p>黑木耳邇來普通貨無甚上落、惟上莊川耳頗覺堅緊、曾開至三百三十七八元、而副耳更缺、如於什耳中篩出之大朵面張、亦需三百八十元云、</p>
<h3>五金　白鐵瓦客暢不銷</h3>
<p>白鐵瓦交易、昨市僅本埠建築帮、外埠客商則覺十分冷落、查昨全市華北數帮祇裝去數十紮、本街建築帮搜去亦有近百紮光景、故市况尚佳、開價亦好起二三角、如三尺六尺每張售五元七角、三尺七尺每張售六元七角、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布逢廉　續有收買</h3>
<p>布市月底度過、市上散戶廉貨漸罄、廠盤堅挺、本客帮現銷有轉蘇之象、人心安定、逢廉續有吸收、白貨·粗布每疋漲一角至二角半、細布·細斜平平、漂染布疋、大都雖仍開原盤、市氣亦巳帶緊、英商怡和廠開出十一磅三兎·三鹿·三貓粗布六百包、由同業購進本街同業手貨、成交頗活潑、計白貨粗布·細布·細斜四百餘件、漂布色布·色斜·絨布·印花布疋二百餘件、溫南帮辦粗布·細斜·色斜等貨二百餘件、閩帮辦色素嗶嘰色斜三千餘疋、滇帮辦色斜·綫呢·藍布二千餘疋、國外生意稍轉沉寂、昨有疋頭八百六十件運寗波、</p>

<h3>馬褲呢大衣　依然盛行</h3>
<p>邇來天氣轉寒、呢絨夾大衣、大新街一帶洋服店、按日定製者步增、今年依然盛行馬褲呢與駝斯錦、故是二項走銷續廣、刻章華怡和寅豐馬褲呢、大半齊喊沽十元〇五角、英製一〇〇五統喊沽十八元、孔士牌子提高五角、駝斯錦西貨售十八元半、怡和十五元半、永興十一元七角半、服裝舖因原料及一切開支均見上漲、故對於各種夾大衣、售價亦增、頭等每件定價的為九十元、二等七十元、三等五十五元、劣等起碼四十元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　馬克白煤小十元</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤、自前月大批湧到、存貨山積、人心虛弱、市勢向下、致同業交易寥寥、但日昨義泰興關盤、仍做原價、蓋因水脚關稅、有增無减、成本攸關、實難再跌、惟某行開出馬克白煤、每噸削碼十元、計做同行拆價、塊煤一百零六元、小子一百元、煤屑五十八允、棧房自車、行根外加、</p>
<h3>黃岩炭暢銷</h3>
<p>溫州木炭自甌江封鎖以來、航運不通、來源受阻、祗由幾艘帆船搭裝、為數亦有限、最多兩三百担、向行拆價、暗槃每担巳喊十一元、但亦杯水車薪、聊資點綴、本市門莊店家大多售海門黃岩炭、碼如排貨、每担七元六角、同業送到、行扛另加、本街零售、每斤兩角云、</p>

<h3>越界築路事件　因新襲擊案發生　局方加緊交涉　英美領研究具體方案　工部局例會未加討論</h3>
<p>昨晚從西人可靠方面探悉、工部局要員、昨鑒於一日晨哥倫比亞路偽警射擊西捕事伴之發生、遂有將所起草之滬西越界築路問題具體方案、從速向偽方提出之意、以求該區糾紛之早獲解決、茲將各情分述如次、</p>
<p>具體方案</p>
<p>關於滬西越界築路問題、前由工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥。及警務處總巡鮑恩、依據「建議綱領」、起草「具體方案」、俾從而商討解決工部局與偽「市府」最近所發生之一切爭執、該項方案、巳於上週末起草竣事、惟以關係重大、「建議綱領」、雖巳由工部局總董樊克令、於上月二十六日晚提示於偽「市長」傅筱庵、至「具體方案」、現尙未送出、</p>
<p>英美研究</p>
<p>據昨晚得可靠消息、工部局現正將「具體方案」、繕具副本多份、分送英籍董事五人、及美籍董事二人研究、徵求意見、於董事會之外、接觸會商、然後交總董樊克令與偽方折衝、此案重心、繫於英美、無法交中日雙方董事公開討論、故悉昨日下午叫時半舉行之董事會、除討論例案外、並未涉及該問題、蓋一則可免引起中日董事之直接衝突、且會外接洽、比較可多迥旋餘地也、</p>
<p>注重警權</p>
<p>具體方案內容如何、現當局嚴守秘密、聞華董五人、亦未前知、大致係主張在警務方面、以共同管理為原則、一如俞費方案、（兪鴻鈞與費信惇）捐稅問題、則暫不討論、稍緩再行談判、</p>
<h3>新襲擊案</h3>
<p>越界築　問題、迄未解決、而偽警越界侵權行為、層見迭出、與租界巡捕、已形成對峙局面、昨晨零時五分、哥倫比亞路近安和寺路處、又發生偽警槍擊租界西捕事件、詳情巳見昨日本報最後消息欄內、茲將續得之詳情、分述於次</p>
<p>偽警開槍　六十餘發</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局警務處外籍警員二名昨（三十一日）夜駕馬達自由車與「大道警察發生微小之意外事件、而顯巴和陸解決後、該兩警員突遭其他大道警察開槍圍擊與毆辱、而彼等之手槍手錶與電光燈各一隻、亦速大道警察奪走、此事係今日（一日）上午十二時零五分起、發生於哥侖比亞路上距安和寺路不遠處、大道警察發彈逾六十顆、該兩外籍警員並未還擊、因不見對手匿於何處也、</p>
<p>手錶電燈　均被竊去</p>
<p>美僑海寗遜與格萊時方駕汽車返寓、適在火綫之中、幾遭大道警察所發槍彈擊中、警務處大道方面與央軍旋派大隊到塲、阻止射擊、經長久交涉、始將手槍交還警務處、惟巳缺彈三顆、而手錶與電光燈、被大道警察竊去、</p>
<p>兩西人車　處境危險</p>
<p>牽涉此事中之美僑海格兩氏時、驚車隨大道警察一卡車後、循哥侖比亞路而行、警察處馬達自由車自對方駛近卡車、槍聲陡發時、兩車已交臂駛過、而卡車之大道警察、亦加開槍、海格兩氏之車、停於兩外籍警員避身處十尺外、槍彈數顆、呼嘯飛過車旁、海格兩氏乃立即開車、倒駛入附近某外僑寓所之汽車道中暫避、</p>
<p>偽府企圖　開征車捐</p>
<p>字林報云、「市長一傳筱庵、頃函覆上海領袖領事尼羅、對於尼羅要求行駛界外馬路之汽車於界外馬路問題和睦解決後、始懸「特別市府」照會一節、加以拒絕、函中並稱、自明年一月一日起、在公共租界越界築路行駛任何汽牟、概須懸「市府」照會、</p>
<h3>西郊槍聲不斷　華軍正攻擊中　青浦傳來猛烈爆炸聲戰事當在虹橋路之南　法軍炸燬手溜彈說未能證實</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、陸家路凱旋路區居民、於昨日（三十一日）午後與晚間、直至午後九時止、聞滬南有炸彈爆發、與涉槍機關槍聲、此乃游擊隊繼續攻擊日軍之徵象、虹橋居民亦稱午後曾聞南方有機關槍聲、並於晨間將近六時、聞飛機塲向西公路上自靑浦方面傳來甚劇烈之爆炸聲、</p>
<p>青浦傳來　猛烈炸聲</p>
<p>昨日上午居民所聞爆炸聲、非自游擊隊發出者、而係法軍炸毀手溜彈、今（一日）晨報紙謂昨日上午五時至十時所聞爆裂聲、均係法軍炸毀手溜彈時之聲饗、但英文大美晚報未能證實法軍竟於淸晨五時前起床而從事此種工作、且法軍亦不致在靑浦或法租界以南炸毀其手溜彈也、</p>
<p>一說爆炸　燬手溜彈</p>
<p>字林報云、昨（三十一日）晨五至十時間、徐家匯村方面、斷續發出爆炸聲甚多、西區居民聞之、大起騷動、茲查悉法軍當局因所積一年以上手溜彈有自爆之處、故認為繼續積存、不甚安全乃加以炸毀之、法軍當局、會於星期一日以大批手溜彈將加爆炸事、通知日當局、然後就地掘巨穴、安置裝箱之手溜彈於其中、該區五百公尺內之居民、悉數退出後、乃將手溜彈一一炸盡、查往年常例、法當局向以危險之手溜彈運至法軍艦上、駛入海中而沉沒之、然本年發覺不能出此、故採用昨日之辦法、</p>
<p>當有重要　物件被擊</p>
<p>虹橋路西青浦東境之華游擊隊、自上月三十日晚起、與日軍交綏、迄至昨日、猶不斷襲擊、寓居凱旋路一帶之住戶、至前晚九時、均仍聞得斷續之炸彈爆裂聲、與機關槍聲、虹橋路之住戶、則至昨日午後、仍聞機關槍聲自南面淸晰傳來、又據虹橋路居民稱、昨日上午六時前、有猛烈之爆炸聲一響、自靑浦方面傳來、常有何種重要物件被擊、</p>
<p>日偽慌張　強抽壯丁</p>
<p>上海四郊華方游擊隊日趨逼近、所有鐵路與公路送遭破壞、予日軍交通命脈以嚴重打擊、日軍防不勝防、現命大道市府轉飭十三個「大道區公署」、迫令各地民衆、組織「鐵道愛護會」、或「道路愛護會」、「大道區長」「大道鎭長」等、乃借題發揮、挨戶抽取壯丁、義務替日方護路、設某路遭華軍破壞者、某路四週之壯丁、均受嚴厲懲處、以是少壯被迫、流亡日衆、</p>
<p>日軍防綫　業已縮短</p>
<p>滬西華方流動部隊、經第×戰區司令切實整理後、已多數易有訓練之正規部隊、以省保安隊為主幹、實數的有正規軍兩團、佐以當地民團、近一週之發展、滬西通靑浦寳山嘉定及是海縣屬之各鎭交通綫、悉受控制、日軍已縮短防綫、集中江灣兵房及大塲飛機塲、偽軍匿於越界桀路區域、因此至晚槍聲小絕、草木皆兵、在滬西越界築路以外之偽官廳中偽員、均呈無限惶慮、偽「警分局」偽「法院」等、於下午二時、即嚴閉前後門、所有偽員、一律走出、或居虹口、或居愚園路等處、至翌晨日軍照例放哨始再返、</p>
<p>電車代價券　限用至年終　兩公司將通告　偽券數目甚鉅</p>
<p>兩租界電車公司因分幣缺乏發行之代價券、現因中央銀行分幣券業巳發行流通、茲兩公司已決定於即日起、設法將代價券逐漸收回、所有發出之代價券、統限用至十二月卅一日為止、逾期作廢、即將通告週知、又聞此决公共租界發行代價券、因市上發現偽造、經公司收回銷燬者、數達萬元以上、損失甚鉅、</p>
<h3>長江空軍　炸燬日艦　前傳為鳳陽丸　係興東丸之誤</h3>
<p>日前報載浮梁電訊、日運輸艦鳳陽丸、在長江九江附近江面下駛之際、遭華軍擊沉等情、當時語意不明、是否為空軍炸沉、抑係大砲轟沉、不得而知、一般服務於鳳陽丸上之無知華工、其家屬尤為焦急、茲據探悉、出事者並非鳳陽丸、（按鳳陽丸前會改充運輸艦、現歸日商東亞海運株式會社管理下之長江班商輪）係東亞會社新建之興東丸、載重的二千噸、行駛長江僅有一月、即遭華機空襲、投彈轟炸、彈着邊際、炸毀艙面一部外、引擎間完全損壞、不能行動、但未下沉、現泊長江中、即將拖駛來滬修理、鳳陽丸亦將返滬、</p>
<h3>北江西路缺口　檢查未懈　日兵不斷巡邏　居民陸續他徒</h3>
<p>蘇州河北甲區北江西路東邊鐵絲網封鎖區、在文監師路口及海寗路口兩罅隙處、站崗守衛之日兵、對進出居民、檢查仍極苛嚴、允對擔負包裹者、必勒令解散察看後、始准通過、無論男女老幼、無一倖免、此對目前滬郊之緊張局勢、當不無關係也、又北江西路東封鎖綫內、因交通已遭阻斷、且日兵不斷逡巡、致居民紛紛他遷、據大通社記者調查所得、該區內原有商店八十九家、現已倒閉卅三家、約佔全部商店百分之二十七、</p>
<h3>兩租界　籌備冬防　考查警捕實力　隨時應機措置</h3>
<p>英法兩租界警務當局、因時屆冬令、為確保治安、及市民生命財產之安全起見英租界方面總董樊克令、巳定五日上午、在跑馬廳檢閱中西印日各級巡捕、藉以明瞭實力、以作冬防之準備、法租界方面數决招募之華捕四百餘人、現每晨分隊加緊訓練、並隨時派往各捕房及馬路從事實習、藉以增强警力、冬防的須下月實施、惟目下租界防務、極臻嚴密、倘有特殊情形、隨機措置、足有餘裕、</p>
<p>中央售票員　熱心救難</p>
<p>本市亞爾培路中央運動塲售票間同人、熱心救難、自八一三戰事後、按月捐助善團經費、從未間斷、前後巳達四千餘元、按該塲售票同人、賴勞力度日、其集捐辦法、係每人每星期繳付兩角、全月凑足一百八十元、自市民組勸募委員會推行勸募認養難民、彼等即將此款按月認養難民九十人、最近由市民組領得金色認養獎章一枚、但因人數衆多、究歸誰得、難於解決、爰發起義賣募集臨時捐、誰出款最多者、卽為該獎章之得主、限於售票間同人參加、有蔡金龍君巳願出二百元得此榮譽獎章、但尙在競賣中、義賣捐款、仍移助市民組勸募委員會、其熱忱殊足令人欽偑、</p>
<h3>滬北民地　被強制圈購　日方設「上海恒產公司」　任意估價給不兌現債劵</h3>
<p>日人投資所辦之「上海恒產公司」、近在滬北一帶、强制征用民地、希圖興建民房、繁榮市面、出租貿利、各處被圈民地、面積之廣、殊感驚人、昔年閘北江灣一帶之華人地主、其戰後所保有之不動地產、均將斷送於該公司之手、凡任何一方民地被圈之後、如地主因無通行證而前往交涉、即予沒收、如前往聲訴者、則由公司任意估價、且僅給予最低價額之不兌現債券一紙、作為巳經收買、由地主簽字捺印、不得後悔、管理此事者、為恒產公司中之課長日人平井、一般地主產權被侵佔後、莫不切齒、</p>

<h3>日人在福山開槍　阻止運米來滬　日兵四五十名馳往福山　發槍威脅禁米船靠德輸</h3>
<p>字林報云、德人註冊之江輪大連號、昨日（卅一日）午刻左右、泊長江福山港、時有載米帆船兩艘之舟子、擬將米糧裝入該德輪、因遭日軍用機關槍射擊而終止、幸未傷人、但大連輪祇得未載此貨而返滬、蓋帆船舟子被</p>
<p>日軍槍彈</p>
<p>所威脅、拒不駛返該德輪旁也、此事之起、顯係駐滸浦日軍搏得米糧將裝德輪運走之消息、乃有全副武裝日兵四五十名携機關槍一挺、於昨日午前九時許、登日人註冊但實係華人所有之新江南號輪、令儘速</p>
<p>駛往福山</p>
<p>據目擊者談、該輪駛抵福山港時、即泊於相去大連號輪約一千碼處、不發警告、遠行開槍、據估計日兵共發的三十五彈、但巳足使帆船舟子停止裝貨入德輪之企圖、而</p>
<p>盪槳返岸</p>
<p>大連號與新江南號兩輪、均於昨晚抵滬、日軍開槍之說、已由兩輪船員予以證實、叉聞日軍並未登大連輪、僅令新江南輪船長載彼等返滸浦上岸後、准該輪駛離、</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、據昨（三十一日）夜傳來本埠之消息、昨日午前的十一時三十分、長江口福山口岸有華人帆船數艘、將米轉裝入德輪新江南號、遭日兵一隊二十四名開放機關槍所阻、但未聞有傷亡者、先是該隊日兵於午前十時三十分左右、在滸浦口登大連輪、令駛往福山、比抵則見</p>
<p>華人帆船</p>
<p>數艘將米約一百包、裝入新江南輪、日兵乃開機關槍向帆船射擊、以阻其裝米行動、業巳裝入新江南輪之米若干、則强令卸下、復裝入帆船、旋由大連輪將此等帆船拖往滸浦、被日軍沒收、新江南輪一旁</p>
<p>雖中數彈</p>
<p>但未聞傷亡、至於帆船中人有無傷亡，昨夜未能確悉、大連輪與新江南輪巳於昨日午後八時半與五時半先後返滬、並無貨物載來、記者昨夜晤兩輪中人、彼等均未能確言日兵放射機關槍時是否有傷亡者、查該兩輪各重</p>
<p>約八十噸</p>
<p>聞日人除對日輪外、擬禁任何輪船在長江口各口岸裝卸貨物、而長江口各口岸與上海間之貨客運輸、除非先滿足日輪之要求、則第三國輪船不准載這貨客、新江南輪係於昨晨自上海駛往福山、所載一般貨物被阻、不得卸入帆船、結果、貨客均</p>
<p>被迫返滬</p>
<p>又聞日兵一隊約三十名、係自大連輪上用機關槍掃射載米帆船歷時的十分鐘、旋携沒收之米、的一百袋與香烟的四百箱返滸浦、而大連輪與新江南輪、均准駛返上海、</p>
<h3>加籐卽將來滬　擬與英美談判　目的在補充東京會議　舉行適合時宜之討論</h3>
<p>字林報十月三十一日東京特電云、據「日日新聞」載稱、日本特使加籐、即將自東京啟程赴上海、俾與英國駐華大使寇爾爵士及美國駐滬總領事高斯循一般路綫、從事談判、以補充東京之會議云、外務省發言人今日告記者稱、加籐啟程赴滬日期、尙未决定、加籐抵滬時、當然將與美英當局不時舉行適合時宜之討論、但未必作特殊談判云、同時、加籐因商議重要之中日事件、尤其為汪精衛成立「新南京政府」事、刻仍留滯東京、關於新南京政府據外務省發言人告記者稱、日本雖將支持該「政府」、但正式加以承認問題、則為將來之事、</p>
<h3>工潮急轉直下　綸昌廠將復業　日軍不堅持武裝駐廠　資方允增加工資三成</h3>
<p>英商綸昌工潮自發生迄今、已閱五月餘、勞資雙方均蒙受極大損失、雙方雖皆欲早日復工、但因幕後有人挾持、故一時未得解決、但資方則仍不斷努力作解決此工潮之工作、而該廠二千餘工友、亦巳不能再事隱忍、羣起責難把持工潮之某代表、現悉此工潮巳有急轉直下之勢、茲將詳情誌後、</p>
<p>要求駐軍　不再堅持</p>
<p>此次勞資雙方爭執之要點、為資方須允許廠中駐守武裝日軍、而資方因此事與廠中管理權大有關係、故寗可犧牲營業、不允承認此項條件、現日方自知理由欠缺、如冉堅持以此條件為解決工潮之前提、則必更受工友反對故授命其某代表、不必再提及此項條件、但前所提增加工資二成之條件、現則改為增加工資三成、聞資方對此條件、表示可接受、</p>
<p>工友責難　約期答復</p>
<p>按該廠工友至大民會領取津貼日期、為每月之一日十一日二十一日、每决工友於領取津貼、必詢問代表交涉情形、該代表則合正在交涉中、現該廠全體工友、巳悉此全係謊言、緣彼等巳知過去數月中、資方雖迭决謀求合理之解決、而該代表則未嘗與資方談判、故昨日該廠工友至大民會領取津貼時、羣起責難、大民會代表顧某、不得巳乃在東昌路「大道市府」對工友聲言，現巳確實與資方談判、的於本月十一日、即可得一明確之回復、</p>
<p>已在修理　準備開廠</p>
<p>該廠工友因每月僅領十三元之津貼、不克維持生活、巳有大部份工友轉至他廠工作、據大中社記者探悉、該廠巳在着手修理機件、一切原料物品、巳運入該廠、頂料不久可開廠復工、</p>
<p>內地郵局差役　要求津貼　召開代表會議商討辦法</p>
<p>上海郵政管理城所屬三十八內地局崑山·松江·嘉定·周家橋·麒麟鎭·太倉·崇明·南洋·等郵差勞工二百餘人、以內地生活程度高昂、米珠薪桂、開支浩繁、曾要求上海郵務工會轉請總管理局局長乍配林氏、准予按月津貼生活費十元、茲已蒙工會方面應允、日昨推派代表曹禮成·張成富·張振生·等會同工會代表稈左卿·王凱·晉謁郵政總管理局內地業務股股長高志誠氏、各代表除詳陳生活維艱、物價飛漲情形外、即耍求轉懇局長乍配林、准予與滬局同等待遇、高氏表示同情、允轉懇當局、予以辦理、各代表獲得滿意後、復於當日下午叫時、於北蘇州路總管理局四樓、召開代表會議、商討辦法、工會亦派程左卿王凱·出席指導、後經議决、結果靜待內地股股長高志誠氏交涉結果如何而定、茲悉各該內地局郵差勞工代表留居匕海、靜候圓滿解决、</p>

<h3>語文和通俗文學</h3>
<p>— 聞歌</p>
<p>我國方言的龐雜，文盲的衆多，這都是不能吾認的事實。所以成為這種種現象的緣故，前者可說是安土重遷的習俗的作梗，後者則是玄學式敎育的結果。雖然這些以外自然還有其他重要的原因，但就問題的本身來說，這些似乎更重要。如把這兩重阻礙消除，我們便無法糾正畸形發展著的病態的現象。所以，許多人都明白這一點的重耍，便對症來了一個通俗文學運動；預備利用這一運動的力量，深入到毫無阻隔毫無遮攔的境地，使我們的知識和精神澈底的互相交流著。這是值得重視的工作，是每一個文藝工作者應該義不容辭的動手做的。</p>
<p>不過如其僅僅只有通俗文學方面的努力，那還是有點問題的，因為它的本身只在接近識幾個字的羣衆，對於更廣大的不識字的羣衆，却依然無法接近。因此，又有許多人知道這一缺點也很重要，便又有了新文字運動的推行，頂備憑藉這一運動的力量，把語言和文字統一起來，提高國民知識的水準。這也是眼前我們所不能猶豫的工作，任何人都不能加以輕視的。</p>
<p>這兩個運動，其實是統一的，不過是方向上的不同而巳。它們的本質總在打通方言的阻隔和文盲的遮攔。我們不能顧了通俗文學，不顧文字的改進，也不能只顧文字的改進，不顧通俗文學，而是雙方都得顧到。這麽著，才能澈底的使口語和文字統一，才能眞實的使全國毫無阻隔！</p>
<p>語文展覽會轉眼就要揭幕了，這算是我的獻辭。我明白，這個展覽會對於我們是必需的，因為這是推行通俗文學和新文字運動先使大衆認識一下內容的最好方法。</p>
<p>哪，我們就努力起來吧！</p>
<h3>北平城里的水夫</h3>
<p>— 朱鬊章</p>
<p>暗澹的北平城里的叫更天，一些野裊飛過伸着黧黑枚枝的幾個院落，在這條弄底同時亦起了伊啞的轆轤的水車聲。</p>
<p>近了，那些衣服起了油垢，而且零落得不堪的水夫，大冷天赤着浮腫的脚跺，拉着笨重的水箱行來，他們危然地擺動身子，舉起攣痙的大腿，顫抖中一步二步在路上顛簸着，撥出些水沫……終於輪軸的轉動加快地把他們的後影送出這條街，遠去，遠去直到那悲凄的輪聲停了，北平城—巳沒入了晨熹中。</p>
<p>羅馬式的敎堂的禱鐘剛敲，在亮頭髮的婆娘們提着菜籃上街的擾雜中，却又可聽見他們的聲音。</p>
<p>「先生，早餐用過麼？」一個口里細着槓麵兒，一隻肩胛套住繩索的水夫，夾在裏邊，見到我便仰起了頭喊了。</p>
<p>「哦，喫過了，河水凍冰了？」我在注視他們擔着擁管的欽佩中這樣回答他們，他們亦有時頑皮地瞇着眼對我喜歡地做了幾下。……</p>
<p>北平城里的水夫，終年過着很苦惱的生活，更其是在道冬天，在香爐似的不融些冰兒照不到陽光的胡同里，他們的居屋是沒有火種燃着的。下雪了，亦得憑這幾件襖子，走完長長的路。</p>
<p>做水夫的，不一定是卑下的，他們有父子合夥，兄弟同手，甚至有時亦可見到蓬鬆着頭的女子帮着他丈夫「造命」。他們多數是些從松花江顛沛到滔滔的渤海灣，然後設法行業，於是閒着的時候常與他們同病相憐地爽談關於你所要問的話。——</p>
<p>走進破陋的賸下來的殘屋，首先使你注意的，便是幾頂掛在牆上的笠帽與幾件不整的茅衣。跨進院子，他們便全在那里，剝着淡味的乾煨豆，坐在井邊閒散地徑自作計。</p>
<p>這種處所我到得最多，我簡直是說最喜歡接近他們。他們並不十分鹵莽，遇到局外的人，却也不是故意降低了自己的身份來說話的，他們能把手掌里的東西，分給你一些，把你圍在中間，把最懇切的話詳細地告訴你。——</p>
<p>「先生，從風沙的平野流到這里來，雖不說全無樂趣，要是讓我們居了高樓大房，却也終覺得似失落了什麼似的。我們是無家的人，不過未曾不想家的重來，在我們突着靑筋時，淌着鼻涕時；在我們流着冬天的汗水時：—全是充滿了想念。」—</p>
<p>「先生，這眞是太苦了啊：在你們還在甜夢中時，我們便耍打水了；在你們喫着暖粥時，我們却還在拉着車兒，直到北平城的故宮的門開了：我們纔拖了疲憊的身子回來齟生硬的東西。先生：我們兄弟幾個，在那一夜是不流淚的？我們時常這末在想，當蘆溝橋下的潮水撥來的時候，便想到松花江的高漲了。……」</p>
<p>的確據伏在拱圓形櫃台七的先生們講，他們來時的情景是够苦的，很有幾個很小很小時來的，現在亦在代着他們的爸爸去拉車，爸爸們還是那末地誆騙着這些孩子：「孩子，你拖着水車走遍了全城，便可遇見了你們的媽了。」然而，大人們揮着淚送他們出門，誰是不躭憂以後孩子們失失望之餘的悲痛呢？</p>
<p>古老的北平城啊，全充滿着蜷縮，不振的氣息，他們難得見到國徽的圖形，他們難得見到田野的耕犂，他們難得見到海螺的號子，但一當他們是疑夢疑眞的看見的時候，便再亦不肯收回驚動了縣老爺們公館裏幽靜的空氣的吶喊：「做水夫的啊，爭到了這些——回去。」……</p>
<p>暮靄挾着殘霧籠罩了這高聳的「銅架」，那是「北平城」啊，——不，我不時曾見到掛在空中電車綫上爆發的幾朶碧綠的火花。——離北平已有多年了！</p>
<p>願水夫們成就了他們的宏願，他們已奔出了還鄕河的一端，願北平城裏的早晨，再亦沒有那沉重的水箱車聲而要加厲地把北風吹起，敎訓城裹黃袍的老爺們啊，親自提了水桶去搖動轆轤，——</p>
<p>最後，那般堅毅的水夫們的生活，該是一種嶄新的飛躍的了罷。</p>
<h3>探望者</h3>
<p>— 金子</p>
<p>昨夜，快是黎明的時候，我卻夢了。</p>
<p>是秋天的早晨，我在家鄉的小河邊，低迴緩步，天空里好像有一層薄薄的朝霧，露兒在常綠樹的葉子上撒下了淸凉，四下里沒點兒聲息，河水也只無言的流着，那種輕適，恬靜使我墜入於沉思中。</p>
<p>這沉思到醒來却勾起我幾多懷鄕的意念啊！</p>
<p>假使在故鄕，菊兒該早開了吧！</p>
<p>這季節是怎樣的季節呢————</p>
<p>獨個兒去到湖上，泛一葉扁舟，任它自在地穿過長條的柳絲，泊在白石砌成的橋拱下，湖心里有一片逼人的凉氣。回頭來再踏上綠楊村，到叢竹林里去看菊花大會，茅簷下綴着斗大的用菊兒編成的字，屋子里更到處皆是菊，爭芳鬥妍，各自開着艷異的花。</p>
<p>找一個僻靜點的地方坐下，靜息一會兒，黃昏很快的瀉下來了，已凉天氣未寒時，晚風從林子里把秋意拂進了衣襟</p>
<p>或者，再到土岡下，和幾個孩子彎着腰採擷那路畔的雛菊；回來挿在膽瓶里，粉紫色的花瓣像一隻隻嬌嫩的小臉，羞怯的藏在綠葉叢里，似有無限溫柔，向人偷露。</p>
<p>到晚上，檯燈射出淺籃的光，照得它更像七月底夜空中的繁星，在壁角里惺忪着睡眼。</p>
<p>這些情景到如今想起，是只無疑地添上了客窗的愁慘。家園巳破碎得只賸一堆瓦礫，原野也早給炸成了焦土，菊兒呢，我更彷彿看見它在晃亮的刺刀下，給劃成了片片，像支離的屍體，一瓣瓣撒滿在地上</p>
<p>異鄕的人是如何日日夜夜的悵望着它北國的田野，流浪的日子却是沒有盡頭的，生活更像一條剛從熔爐里抽出來的火紅的鐵鞭——</p>
<p>江南，除了游子身上單薄的衣裾，更何處找得到秋天呢</p>
<p>但這也不值得怨恨的！</p>
<p>『死並不是完結。』明年此刻，菊兒的種子會再從泥土里茁生起來的，冒着冷露，也冒着嚴霜。</p>
<p>是的，這江南有什麽可戀棧的呢！我該回去，從那小河邊，從湖畔，土岡下，從廣袤的禾塲上，去探望一下那新生的菊兒的消息。</p>

<h3>激流</h3>
<p>— 余豆村</p>
<p>我願我是一支奔騰的激流，永不休止。</p>
<p>可用不着探詢我的泉源。算我本是一滴似塵埃般渺小的雨粒，但我懷着莫大的志願：不停地飛灑，將晶瑩滋潤大地的憔悴，灌溉枯土的乾燥，這樣，我便能感動夥伴，糾合同志，滙成一條廣大的淸流。</p>
<p>誰要問為什麽要流，我將說：人生像徵一條悠長的路，時代像微一個輾轉的車輪。要是不奔流，便趕不上人生的旅程。偉大的時代更不容許靜止，雖是江岸的兩旁，有着綠茵紅花，垂楊暗柳，却不能悠閒地有片刻的暫駐，作貪婪的欣賞。誰貪婪，誰要趕不上路，落後！</p>
<p>可用不着探詢我奔流的範疇。凡是宇宙間黑暗的所在，便是奔流的領域。流，許是流遍滾滾的黃河，揚子江，珠江，以至鴨綠江，洗凈江岸一切的暴作獸行。殘狄血腥，冲散苦難同胞抑鬱的陰影，點起心的明燈。</p>
<p>誰要問為什麽要奔流得那般響亮，激烈？我將告訴他：我是在發揮天賦的偉力，激起無數的浪花，像是萬馬奔騰，軍號吹動，戰鼓鼕鼕，掩滅了懦弱者的悲嘆吟呻，振起了戰士的斬殺精神，流，激烈地流，過了樸紫的村鄉，又經秀麗的山坡，不息地，我鼓着波浪。</p>
<p>我底旅程很迢遙，遼闊。</p>
<p>人生是緊張的，時代也是偉大的，兩者都不容我不流，也不許我靜流。</p>
<p>所以，我是一條激流，踴躍地。</p>

<h3>游藝界　扶輪社主辦的　徵集苦兒玩具電影</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>——耶誕前輪流在各大影院公映——</p>
<p>耶誕之前，上海照例有各團體發起放映微集苦兒玩具的電影。在上海，尤其是戰後，不知有着多少苦兒，他們終年是沒有享得娛樂的。因此為使這些苦兒在耶誕時節，也可娛樂起見，像靑年會，扶輪社等各機關，照例在耶誕之前，要發起放映徵慕苦兒玩具的電影。而目前，離耶誕新年為日無多，扶輪社主辦的微集苦兒玩具電影，巳開始在各大戲院輪流放映了。</p>
<p>放映徵集苦兒玩具的電影，時間每是在星期日上午，假各大戲院輪流公映。進去看電影的人，不必化錢買門票，而每人可帶一件新的或舊的玩具，掉換門票。今年抉輪社主辦的徵集苦兒玩具電影，第一次在前星期日，十月二十二日，上午十時半，假南京大戲院公映。因為這種電影，對象是兒童，所以放映的也就以兒童影片為限。參觀的孩子相當衆多，徵得的新舊玩具，也有五千件以上。</p>
<p>第二次巳決定在十一月五日即本星期日上午十時半，假座大上海大戲院公映。照頂定計劃，所映的也全是迎合兒童口味的短片，大致和前决在南京公映的會一樣精彩。好萊塢各影片公司的駐滬辦事處，對於此種善舉，都表示贊助，而無條件多把影片借給扶輪社放映。扶輪社方面，徵得玩具之後，除新的以外，舊的將逐一加以修理，預備在耶誕時節，能够分發給苦兒。希望小朋友們，愛看電影的，大家拿了玩具，換了門票參觀。尤其破舊的玩具，放在家裏沒有用處，拿了去自己可看到電影，苦兒可得到玩具玩要，一舉兩得，何樂而不為，幸勿失之交臂！</p>
<h3>卡爾登觀劇雜感</h3>
<p>— 詩味軒</p>
<p>卡爾登最近又演舊劇，禮拜四夜，曾往一觀也，七時已高顧客滿牌，值此各舞台以平角競爭之際，而卡爾登竟能　與抗衡，信芳之號召力，誠不可輕視矣。故余所欲談者，亦以信芳為限。宋十回前段由百歲素雯合演，後則信芳熙春，宋江途遇劉唐，唯唯吾吾，若接若離，在相識不相識之間，形容逼眞，引至酒樓之跑塲及登樓姿態，急切緊凑，一氣貫成，可謂善體當時情景，堪稱絕作。宿院晨起，兩目半開半閉，斜睨曦窗，一副睡眼未醒，畏見曙光之情態，神妙之至。回院檢袋殺媳一塲，不火不亂，不多不少，惟旣殺之後，手舉血刃若痴若狂，兩手抓空，演來有十餘分鐘之久，似覺過當。因宋江非一無能之輩，且在宿院之夜，巳有殺媳動機，雖殺非得已，然旣殺之後，即應先查書信之下落，下樓時又曰好　做事一身當，則宋江果是一條好漢，非胸無主宰之莽徙可比，即使心有所感，神志慌亂亦不至若是之甚。故愚意此塲表情稍嫌過當，大凡演劇者能體會劇中人之身分，代表劇中人之舉動，可使觀者以假為眞，而忘其為戲，倘過於認眞，舉動失實，則反使假者更假，一望而知其為戲矣。信芳表演，南北一人，以此劇而論，如聳肩，縮頸·眼珠轉動等等，皆較從前為甚，恐不免過當之弊，未知信芳以為然否？近日徐君所談之金銀問題，信芳與煦春皆曰黃金一錠，即可作為答案矣。壓軸斬經堂與追韓信等，同為信芳之成名作，自始至終，無懈可擊，是晚能賣滿座，未始非是劇之號召力也。余自聞信芳創設移風社以來，對於信芳改造戲劇，以獨持之表情天才，參以精密之編排導演，將來成就未可限量。所謂海派本戲，要知並非舊劇之叛徒，因時制宜，實可為中國劇界放一異采。信芳負移風之名，應副移風之實，叫本文素臣，不日將與滬人相見，深望編劇者注重移風二字，為古廟雙棲脫衣向火等宣傳字眼，雖憑此八字，號召觀衆，然移風社與其他舞台之海派不同，余愛移風社，更愛信芳，故略貢愚見，未卜可當一得吾耳？</p>
<h3>更新聆歌記</h3>
<p>— 張昌遒</p>
<p>更新第二期新角趙金蓉自接吳素秋後隊登台獻藝以來，忽巳雙旬，余以日昨（二十八日）觀其臨別所貼之「鴛鴦塚一一劇，爰特誌之。</p>
<p>八時入座，馬秀蓉之「穆柯寨」已成尾聲。</p>
<p>「大水濂洞」於八時十分上演，梁懸超年雖弱冠，而武工確具根底，開打時金光閃爍，觀衆為之眼花潦亂。</p>
<p>大軸係陳少霖之「鬧府出箱」，少霖此次歌來，益較上决（吳素秋出演期內）圓潤，韻味淸醇，行腔自如，確係余派佳奏。惟其賦喉尙欠寬朋，此其缺憾也。</p>
<p>壓軸「鴛鴦塚」於十時上塲，金蓉去王鳳車，扮相酷似硯秋，雍容端莊，表情不善佻薄，而長於悲艷。幽怨鬱結，顰鎖雙眉，令人不勝愛憐。惟身村較胖，身段自難討好也。唱腔有蘭芳之勁實甜潤，有硯秋之抑揚頓挫，鎔梅程於一爐，實屬難能突。末段反二簧，句句悉效程腔。蓋斯劇係乃師硯秋所授者也。佐之周維俊之謝招郞，文雅瀟洒，歌喉淸脆，實不亞於葉盛蘭也。張春彥之楊子胥亦屬穩練。</p>
<p>此悲艷新劇，雖精緻緊凑，然第叫幕，王鳳車因思念謝招郞而病，其嫂吳氏請張道士寫書寄至謝府一塲中，張道士與吳氏之對白過嫌嚕囌，以拙見宜略刪改之，不然全劇精彩將為之减色不少矣。</p>
<h3>樂園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>殺子報與殺父奇案</p>
<p>我們要把從前師生的關係，和現今來比較一下，那就不可同年而語了。殺父案中之告發人，乃係死者之女，正所謂龍生九種，種種不同，她瞧見她父親死的太慘了，自己的能力薄弱，無法制止兩兄弟的殘暴行為，所以才毅然報告捕房，來捕捉欽吉欽祥。可是這一下子，她們周家是絕了後了，父親死了，兩子都處極刑，至於她母親也有應得之罪。本來好好一個家庭，只落得如此慘景，僅剩她一個弱女超然事外，逆子固可殺，然而周永杰刻薄寡恩，性情暴戾，這也是種惡因者得惡果，凡人致富不由正道或敎養子弟不得其道者，都當以此為殷鑑，因果報應之說，雖不可全信，要亦不可完全不信也</p>
<p>這種逆倫的案子，倘在以前封建時代，不特地方州縣官全要受處分，並且連叫鄰也得有罪，要像欽吉欽祥是智識階級受過相當敎育的學生，恐怕連他們的師長也須受嚴厲的處分的。現在時代不同了，當然罪只及本身，不過我的意思像這種慘無人道，亘古稀有的大逆倫案，還宜不編入戲劇，公演於社會的為佳，因為道種大逆小道的行為，三歲的小孩子也知道是不應作的，似小必用戲劇的力量來感化世人，倘使公之於衆，反覺其過於殘酷，令觀者不忍目覩，上海人腦筋太敏捷了，某戲院已將此事編為戲劇，不日公演，據我個人的意見，我是不敢觀光的。　（一三一）</p>

<p>Luoyang: More than 1,000 Japanese troops entrenched in the Yongji and Fenglingdu area divided into groups and invaded eastward on the 29th, engaging in a fierce battle with Chinese troops in the Xiaoli Town and Renjiazhuang areas. (1st dispatch)</p>
<p>Yichang: Although the Japanese troops on various fronts in central Hubei have slightly increased recently, they still do not show an active westward invasion on the main battlefront. However, the Chinese troops are launching attacks at any time, making it extremely difficult for the Japanese troops to cope. Recently, they have mobilized most of their forces on the Yao-Yue Highway and the Hanchuan area, totaling more than 3,000 men, and crossed the Pengshi River in an attempt to attack from both sides. The Chinese troops in Xiantao are fiercely resisting and dividing to meet the attack. The Japanese troops have suffered heavy casualties. At this moment, the Chinese troops and the Japanese troops are engaged in fierce battles in Pengjiachang, Zhoujiabang, and Sanfutang on the east and west sides of Xiantao. (1st dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The battles in the Suixian area are still ongoing. There are battles in Yangmiao, Daxiaosulou, and other places southwest of Suixian. The Chinese troops are in a favorable position, launching crisscross attacks, and the Japanese troops are suffering heavy losses. More than 1,000 Japanese troops who attacked Langhedian still have the intention to continue their attack. The Chinese troops have already strictly blocked and attacked them from their front, flanks and rear. (1st dispatch)</p>
<p>North Hubei: On the 29th of last month, in a certain area, more than 1,700 Japanese troops with more than ten cannons invaded the Minggang South Paomaling Tongmiao area. From morning to evening, the Chinese and Japanese engaged in more than ten hand-to-hand combats, completely defeating the Japanese. Five to six hundred Japanese soldiers were killed.

<p>Laohekou: Since the 28th, Japanese troops have been making moves near the Dahong Mountains. One route attacked Dushan from the south of Suixian, and another route attacked Duchongshan, Youshan, and Puhedian from the southwest of Suixian.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Hebei Breach Dikes, Causing Flooding of One-Third of the Area; Five Million Farmers Suffer</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from here today, Japanese troops in central and southern Hebei, in an attempt to flood guerrillas hiding in sorghum fields, have destroyed all the river dikes, causing up to five million Chinese farmers to be displaced by the floods. One-third of Hebei Province has been flooded, with central Hebei being the most severely affected. However, the guerrillas there are still able to maintain their base areas. In southern Hebei, twelve counties have been flooded, totaling six hundred and ten villages, covering 170,000 mu of land. The Japanese authorities in Hebei Province are now taking advantage of this situation to organize the displaced young men into labor teams and send them to "Manchukuo." The Japanese are claiming that each person can earn six jiao of wages per day, so many have been taken away by the Japanese. At one point, as many as seven or eight trainloads of these farmers were leaving the country every day. The Chinese government has now dispatched a disaster relief commissioner with 300,000 yuan to the area to provide relief to the displaced farmers. (1st United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Brigade Commander Ma Bingzhong Dies Heroically in Battle</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Ma Bingzhong, brigade commander of the Cavalry Division in Yuhuai Qikou, encountered more than 1,000 Japanese cavalrymen in the Nanliu and Xinzhuang area on September 12. He immediately led his troops in a brave charge, fighting fiercely all day, engaging in several hand-to-hand combats, and finally recapturing the Twelve Wangdian Village occupied by the Japanese. The remaining Japanese forces retreated to the outskirts of Huaiyang. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, and dozens of rifles, eight horses, and countless military supplies were captured. In the afternoon, Japanese reinforcements counterattacked with fierce artillery fire and poison gas. Brigade Commander Ma braved the rain of bullets to direct the fighting. The officers and soldiers fought bravely, killing countless Japanese soldiers. The Chinese side also suffered considerable casualties. Brigade Commander Ma and more than 130 officers and soldiers died heroically in battle. A certain director, after receiving the report, noted that since this unit entered Henan to fight, it had repeatedly made outstanding achievements and its contribution was great. This battle was particularly effective in defeating the stubborn Japanese. He was deeply saddened by their heroic sacrifice and specially requested the highest military authorities to grant generous compensation and commendation to inspire others. (1st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops in Dean Defect One After Another</h3>
<p>Xiushui: Japanese troops in Dean, gathering more than 2,500 Japanese and puppet infantry, artillery, and cavalry, launched a large-scale invasion of Minshan on the 26th and forced the puppet police forces of various counties to lead the way. By noon, Japanese and puppet troops had successively infiltrated the mountains. The puppet police forces suddenly defected one after another and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops. The puppet troops responded internally, and the Chinese troops took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, striking from both inside and outside, killing countless Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese forces fled back in disarray. In this battle, the Japanese abandoned five to six hundred corpses. (1st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei Shoot Down a Japanese Plane</h3>
<p>Yichang: On the 28th, several Japanese planes flew to the skies near Xinyouzhou in southern Hubei and strafed the residents there at low altitude, which was extremely cruel. The local militias were extremely indignant and fiercely fired with rifles. One Japanese plane was immediately hit by bullets and caught fire, crashing to the ground. All the Japanese pilots were burned to death, and the Japanese plane was completely destroyed. (1st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Hunan</h3>
<p>Changde: Today, four Japanese planes invaded Hunan Province in three groups. One plane sneaked into the skies over Changsha City at around 10:00 AM and then flew northeast through Hengshan, Hengyang, Shaoyang, Zhijiang, Taoyuan, Changde, and other places. Another plane flew over Lixian, Linli, and Cili at 12:50 PM to reconnoiter and then fled east.

<h3>Japanese Warship Near Zhenhai Hit</h3>
<p>Jinhua: On the morning of the 29th, a Japanese warship came near Longshan near Zhenhai and suddenly fired artillery shells at the shore. The Chinese garrison immediately retaliated fiercely, hitting it with two shells. The Japanese warship smoked and caught fire, and fled in disarray. (1st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northern Route慰問團 Arrives in Guyuan</h3>
<p>Guyuan: The Northern Route慰問團 went to Ningxia from Pingliang on the 30th and arrived in Guyuan on the 31st. The county magistrate led the stationed troops and the people in a warm welcome. This place was once the residence of the Shaanxi-Gansu Governor-General and is the most important town in Gansu. Guyuan and Haiyuan are the areas with the most Hui people. Since the Tongzhi Rebellion, there have been almost no serious conflicts between religions and ethnic groups for a hundred years. The two counties are one of the largest wool-producing areas, producing millions of catties per year. It has not been exported for three years. Although the Ministry of Economic Affairs has sent people to purchase it, most of it has been hoarded by private individuals for speculation, which is worthy of attention. Local prohibition and conscription have achieved remarkable results, and the public security is also quite impressive. The group will arrive in Ningxia on the 3rd. (31st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Never Expecting Peace, China is Determined to Continue the War; No Matter How the International Situation Changes, China is Determined to Defend to the End and Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to well-informed Chinese sources in Chongqing, the rumor spread in London that there is a possibility of imminent peace in the Far East is firmly denied. It is said that there is absolutely no sign of expecting peace in Chongqing, whether in the government or among the people. Chinese leaders who recently returned to Chongqing after inspecting the front lines said that no matter what changes occur in the international situation, the Chinese army on the battlefield will be able to defend its territory. This strength is beyond the imagination of the people of Chongqing. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma today firmly denied rumors of peace negotiations between Tokyo and Chongqing. It is said that such rumors are not at all accurate. When a certain foreign reporter asked about this matter, Suma replied that he was quite surprised to hear the spread of such "completely unfounded" rumors. The Japanese government's statement that it will not negotiate with the Chiang Kai-shek government is still valid, and the Japanese government has repeatedly announced that it will fully support the new "central government" of China, which will soon be established, with Wang Jingwei as the central figure. When the spokesman mentioned the possible readjustment of British-Japanese and American-Japanese relations, he firmly stated that the Japanese government has no intention of engaging in formal or informal negotiations with Britain and the United States for the time being. When a reporter asked whether the Japanese government intends to suspend talks with these two countries pending the establishment of the new "central government" of China, the spokesman said that the question of suspension or termination does not arise, because "the Japanese government has never had the intention of starting negotiations with Britain and the United States to resolve the outstanding issues."

<h3>The Anti-British Movement in North China Has Been Ordered to Stop by the Japanese; Anti-British Slogans and Banners Will Be Removed Soon; All Parties in Chongqing Are Closely Watching This Move</h3>
<p>Beiping: According to well-informed Chinese sources in political circles, the Japanese authorities have ordered the cessation of the anti-British movement in North China. This statement remains to be verified, but well-informed sources firmly claim that the Chinese police have been ordered to destroy the anti-British flags hanging in the streets, the anti-British slogans on the walls, and tear down the anti-British posters and leaflets within a few days, and will withdraw the patrol teams in front of the British residences. This situation may indicate that the Japanese side has changed its policy and will develop friendship with democratic countries and gradually distance itself from totalitarian countries. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: News from Beiping says that the Japanese authorities are now stopping the anti-British movement in North China. All circles of Chinese people here are paying close attention to this matter. Chongqing is now waiting for evidence to prove or deny the Japanese side's sudden change of policy. The opinion of all circles of Chinese people is that if this is true, it should be paid great attention. Although China does not want the anti-British movement to continue, it is very willing to know the reasons behind Japan's sudden change of policy towards Britain. They want to know whether this change is due to Britain's making important concessions to Japan that are unfavorable to China. It is also reported that Tokyo news said that Japan decided to establish a new central government of China, and then start negotiations with the United States and Britain. The peace conditions of Japan published in the Asahi Shimbun are also closely concerned by all circles of Chinese people here. However, the masses generally believe that at present, neither the National Government nor the Chinese people are willing to make peace with Japan. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dong Xianguang is Still in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The statement by the Shanghai Japanese news agency that Dong Xianguang, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, "secretly came to Shanghai with a huge sum of money to contact the Shanghai press" is completely unfounded, because Dong held a tea party on Sunday to entertain the Far East Manager of the Associated Press, Mr. Ma Lishi. However, Mr. Ma Lishi left Chongqing for Hong Kong today. (1st Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospects for Shanghai Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>The period of "Shidi Biqi," as commonly referred to in Shanghai's commercial practices, has passed peacefully, which undoubtedly indicates that Shanghai's industries and commerce are still quite stable. More than two years have passed since the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle. Chinese merchants and civilians have been able to resume various production activities in the narrow concession area under special circumstances, allowing millions of Chinese and foreign residents to continue their peaceful lives and preserve a large part of their livelihood under the good guidance of the concession authorities and leaders of the industrial and commercial sectors. This spirit of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens is indeed worthy of considerable admiration.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai's industrial and commercial activities in the past two years have been filled with an atmosphere of speculative boom. In essence, they have not exerted normal functions due to the efforts of the industrial and commercial sectors. The main reasons are the fluctuations in the exchange rate and the soaring prices caused by various environmental limitations in Shanghai itself, which have led to the large-scale profiteering of those who hoard Chinese and foreign goods. As a result, the public believes that as long as they engage in industrial and commercial activities, they can obtain huge profits. Therefore, newly established stores and factories have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and now there is an inevitable trend of being difficult to reverse. The fact that the recent "Shidi Biqi" was able to pass peacefully is not due to the inherent stability of the industrial and commercial sectors themselves; it must be acknowledged that the measures of the National Government have been effective. The discount and loan committee formed by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China has done its best to handle discount mortgages and other loans, directly adjusting interbank finance, and indirectly providing relief to industries and commerce. This is something that Shanghai industrial and commercial operators should clearly recognize.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation in Shanghai, it is neither an appropriate time to revive normal industries and commerce, nor is it actually possible to realize such an attempt. After becoming an isolated island, Shanghai has to bear an illegal and heavy tax burden for both the export and import of goods. Industrial and commercial operators can still obtain considerable profits from their own businesses, but the loss to the country's financial economy is particularly large. Moreover, whether the island's industries and commerce can be freely operated in the future will become an increasingly serious problem. Not to mention the operations of Chinese merchants and civilians, even the industrial and commercial enterprises of European and American merchants are suffering the same fate. The goods needed by Shanghai that are imported from the occupied areas have almost lost their freedom of transportation and sales. A few days ago, the eggs purchased by British and American commercial firms were forcibly plundered by people in the concession. Earlier, the labor unrest in British factories in Pudong and other places was obviously under the pressure and manipulation of violence. As for the goods transported to Shanghai from the interior, the decree on foreign exchange settlement for the export of domestic goods naturally has a considerable impact on the goods transported to Shanghai. As for the goods exported from Shanghai, they have been completely squeezed out by Japanese goods in the occupied areas. In the interior, in order to prevent counterfeit domestic goods, the National Government has recently banned the import of all goods manufactured in Shanghai, except for raw materials. As for exports to foreign countries, since the outbreak of the European war, not only has the source of export goods become a problem, but transportation has also become difficult. Shanghai's industries and commerce originally depended on entrepot trade for normal development, but now they can only focus on local consumption and the activities of囤戶.</p>
<p>The soaring prices have encouraged Shanghai's industrial and commercial activities in the past, but in the future, they will inevitably become an obstacle to industrial and commercial activities. Because if Shanghai's industries and commerce only target the local area, Shanghai's consumption capacity is very limited. The current prices can be said to have reached a considerable height. If they continue to rise continuously, consumers may have no other choice but to tighten their purchasing power to achieve a balance with the soaring prices. Moreover, the soaring prices in the speculative boom are a general increase in the prices of all kinds of goods. As a result, the expenditure also increases relatively with the income. Then, industrial and commercial operators may not be able to obtain huge profits due to the reduction of transactions and the increase of various expenditures, which poses a danger of their own collapse.</p>
<p>Judging from the above situation, Shanghai's industries and commerce have entered an extremely dangerous stage. For the sake of social security and for the sake of the industries and commerce themselves, we cannot but ask industries and commerce to avoid unfortunate events in advance. First, all speculative activities should be terminated immediately to stabilize the development of the business. Efforts should be made to lower prices as much as possible, or at least prevent them from rising further. The best way is to reduce the scope of industries and commerce so as to reduce their own risks and also reduce part of the country's losses. If they can transfer their funds to the interior with the perseverance and spirit of operating industries in this port, it will be of greater assistance to the country. In short, Shanghai's industries and commerce can only seek stability now, not development, because the current Shanghai can only be regarded as a temporary place for funds to escape disaster, and cannot be regarded as the center for the development of industrial and commercial enterprises.</p>
<h3>Finland Issues Statement Abroad: Negotiations with the Soviet Union Likely to be Delayed; Hopes the Soviet Union Respects Treaty Obligations; Finnish Delegation Departs for Moscow</h3>
<p>Helsinki, Finland: Following the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, the Finnish Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union has already raised various issues and declared that the Soviet government is willing to discuss them with the Finnish government. As the Finnish plenipotentiary representatives have just departed for Moscow to deliver a response to the Soviet government, Molotov has openly expressed his views, creating a novel situation. Previous discussions between Finland and the Soviet Union were confidential. Although Finland's firm pursuit of a neutral policy has made negotiations difficult, it still maintains an independent stance, free from the oppression and influence of any foreign country, and strives to find solutions to various issues. In addition, Finland is willing to guarantee the safety of the Soviet Leningrad region, but does not want its own safety to be jeopardized. It is still difficult to know to what extent Finland's position will be affected by Molotov's speech, but it can be asserted that negotiations will be delayed as a result. In essence, Molotov stated that the Soviet Union has the right to take all necessary measures to ensure security in the Gulf of Finland and near the border of Leningrad, and also has this obligation. The Finnish Foreign Ministry hereby declares that the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression treaty with Finland in 1932, promising to respect the existing border and resolve all disputes peacefully. This treaty is valid until 1945, and it is hoped that the Soviet Union will respect it." (Havas Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Stockholm: A Finnish dispatch from a certain newspaper here states that the Finnish delegation led by Paasikivi departed for Moscow last night to continue Finnish-Soviet negotiations, carrying a detailed answer to be submitted to Soviet dictator Stalin. This new proposal represents the unanimous view of the Finnish cabinet and parliament, including the opposition parties. Although its content is currently kept secret, it is said that the proposal is a written expression of the extent of Finland's preparedness, but does not refuse further discussion on the details. The Finns believe that the new proposal will satisfy the Soviet Union, and the Finns intend to accommodate the interests of the Soviet Union with all possible concessions. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland: The Finnish delegation departed for Moscow yesterday, carrying the Finnish government's final proposal. The full text is ten pages long and was drafted and translated into Russian in the last three days, so the delegation was delayed until yesterday. The content of the proposal is unknown to the outside world. According to well-informed sources, Finland is prepared to make concessions to the Soviet Union in order to maintain its neutral status. The Finnish government generally believes that Finnish-Soviet negotiations may not be concluded before the Soviet October Revolution anniversary on November 6. It is widely believed that Finland is prepared to make concessions to the Soviet Union, perhaps in the range of allowing the Soviet Union to fortify four places: Hogland Island, Seskär, Lavansaari, and Tytärsaari. It is noted that the above-mentioned places are the main routes from Helsinki, the capital of Finland, to Kronstadt, Soviet Union. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Moscow: At his speech to the Supreme Soviet, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov yesterday expressed the Soviet Union's determination to resolve the Finnish issue, determined to make Finland comply with the demands raised by the Soviet Union. "If Finland continues to be stubborn, it will become an obstacle to peace." At the same time, news came from Helsinki, Finland, that the Finnish authorities were greatly surprised by this move by the Soviet Union. The Soviet government had previously agreed to wait for the final reply from the Finnish government, which was to be delivered to Moscow today. The Finnish General Staff notified the Finnish cabinet last night that the Soviet Union's demands would be a very serious issue, as they included Finland's only eastern defense line, the so-called "Mannerheim Line." The government also urgently telegraphed the Finnish delegation en route to the Soviet Union, instructing them to call Helsinki from the Soviet border for instructions. Finland attaches particular importance to the points in the Soviet Union's demands concerning Hanko Peninsula, Jägala Island, and the islands in the Gulf of Finland. Soviet government officials held meetings late last night to discuss response measures. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Delegation Arrives in Lithuania</h3>
<p>Kaunas, Lithuania: More than one hundred Soviet military officers have recently arrived here to arrange the deployment locations for Soviet troops as stipulated in the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty, so that Soviet troops can be sent to garrison. Barracks in various parts of Lithuania will be emptied on November 1 for acceptance by Soviet troops. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Kaunas, Lithuania: An official communiqué was recently released stating that all units of the Lithuanian armed forces sent to the Vilnius region have arrived at their destination. (Havas Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium: The 20th Century newspaper recently reported that, according to reliable sources, goods purchased by Germany and the Soviet Union from each other are being transshipped through Lithuania. (Havas Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Kaunas: Regarding the "London Times" report that the number of Soviet troops stationed in Lithuania will increase to tens of thousands, the official authorities here have issued a clarification denying this, denouncing the British newspaper's report as fabricated out of thin air. However, the military delegations of the Soviet Union and Lithuania have a tacit understanding to temporarily keep the contents of the Soviet-Lithuanian agreement secret. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Thorough Reorganization of the Italian Cabinet; Traditional Policies Unchanged; Younger Faction Gains Power; Observing the Situation with a Calm and Cautious Eye</h3>
<p>London: German radio announced the news of the changes in the Italian cabinet today without adding any criticism, only stating that Italian sources said that this change would not affect the Italian Prime Minister's traditional policies. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Milan: After the reorganization of the Italian cabinet, the official authorities have not made any comments, but well-informed sources in the local Fascist Party believe that Mussolini's personal position and the influence of the activist faction within the Fascist Party have been strengthened. They pointed out that the new cabinet members are all close confidants of Mussolini and are prepared to absolutely abide by Mussolini's policies. These are young people who have struggled for many years in the Fascist Party, and the Italian government has been controlled by the activist faction. If Mussolini needs to make new decisions on foreign policy, it is also possible to obtain appropriate solutions. They believe that the appointment of General Graziani as Chief of the Army Staff is a symbol of this trend, as Graziani is a highly respected military leader, and his achievements in Libya and Abyssinia have deeply impressed the Italian people. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>London: Although Rome and Berlin believe that many important changes in the Italian cabinet are merely "a change of guards," a Dutch newspaper today asked, "Is Mussolini preparing for a comprehensive change?" According to a dispatch from Rome from the Dutch "Telegraaf," the changes in the Italian cabinet are insignificant, as Ciano remains Foreign Minister, and Mussolini will continue to direct everything. Both Rome and Berlin said that the Italian Prime Minister often advocates changing cabinet members within a certain period of time in order to provide new contributions. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Rome: After Prime Minister Mussolini abruptly reorganized the cabinet today, people from all walks of life, including certain cabinet members, expressed surprise. Foreign observers are eager to understand the true significance of this move, but opinions are extremely divided. Some say that it is the Prime Minister's consistent policy to change the highest authorities of the Fascist regime from time to time, and this matter is not unusual. However, others say that this move has political significance. Cultural and Propaganda Minister Alfieri and Army Undersecretary and Army Chief of Staff General Pariani were originally the people who handled the signing of various agreements between Germany and Italy, such as the German-Italian news agreement and military cooperation methods. They both maintained close contacts with the German authorities, and General Pariani often held talks with German military leaders. The dismissal of these two people proves that the Prime Minister intends to appoint new cabinet members who are relatively distant from Germany. Although Foreign Minister Ciano remains in his position, the rapprochement between Germany and Italy is not something that Ciano alone can be held responsible for. Moreover, since the establishment of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Ciano has always advocated maintaining complete "neutrality" and believes that Italy should observe the situation with a calm and cautious eye before making major decisions. (Havas Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Balkan Organization: Neutral Bloc; Resisting German and Soviet Advances; Plans Gradually Matured</h3>
<p>London: The Foreign Office announced last night that the plan for Italy to participate in signing a Balkan Pact is about to mature, with the aim of resisting the advances of the Soviet Union and Germany. Romania appears to be Italy's main ally in promoting this plan. The Romanian government has summoned its ambassadors to Turkey and Yugoslavia back to Bucharest for meetings, as Turkey and Yugoslavia agree to expand the Balkan Pact but want to know all the details. The United Kingdom is taking a reserved attitude towards this development, while France has expressed sympathy. However, those close to the British government welcome the news that Italy and Greece are about to sign a non-aggression pact. Sources in London claim that Rome and Athens have decided to reaffirm the non-aggression and friendship treaty signed in 1928. It is believed here that this development is another factor in stabilizing the situation in the Balkans. Well-informed sources here claim that after most of the diplomatic representatives in the Balkans attended two banquets here, the Balkan Conference will be held within two weeks.

<h3>Molotov Elaborates on Soviet Foreign Policy at the Supreme Soviet; Blames Britain and France for Continuing a Meaningless War; Maintains Neutrality and is Willing to Make the Greatest Efforts for Peace</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held a special meeting today. Stalin, Molotov, and other members of the Presidium of the People's Commissars sat on the rostrum. British Ambassador Seeds and others listened in the diplomatic gallery, and the leader of the German commercial delegation stationed in Moscow was also present. Former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov sat in the deputies' seats, next to Dimitrov, the current Secretary-General of the Comintern. Various deputies took their seats by resolution. The last to be seated were the recently elected representatives of the four Ukrainian and West Belarusian regions. The meeting was colorful, with old women in white headscarves, village girls in brightly colored clothes, and men in disheveled attire. When the meeting began, a film camera was placed on the rostrum.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Molotov delivered the opening speech, heavily criticizing Britain and France for refusing to negotiate peace with Germany, saying that "waging a war to destroy Hitlerism in the name of fighting for democracy is not only meaningless but also a crime. The reason why Britain and France are determined to continue the war is that Germany will demand colonies, and Britain will lose its world supremacy. Everyone knows that restoring the old Poland is no longer a problem, so it is absurd to continue the current war under the banner of restoring Poland. The Soviet Union's future goals are: (1) freedom of action in international events, (2) continuation of the policy of neutrality, and (3) cessation of war. Soviet-Japanese commercial negotiations may begin soon, but it is not yet clear to what extent Japan wants to improve Soviet-Japanese relations and when it can be realized." (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Moscow: Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, delivered a report at the Fifth Extraordinary Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union today. His words said: "Comrade deputies, in the past two months, the international situation has undergone great changes, affecting Europe and other countries. The most important events that we must mention here include three items:</p>
<h3>German-Soviet Reconciliation and the Collapse of Poland: Fundamental Changes in the International Situation</h3>
<p>"First, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany has changed. Since the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on August 23, the abnormal relationship between the two countries for many years has been terminated. The ill will that was fostered by certain European countries has been transformed into cordial friendship. The German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Border Demarcation signed in Moscow on September 29 further promoted this good neighborly relationship. This fundamental change in the relationship between the two largest countries in Europe cannot but have a significant impact on the entire international situation, and everything that has happened during this period has confirmed the estimation of the political significance of the German-Soviet reconciliation at the last plenary session of the Supreme Soviet, which was completely correct.</p>
<p>Second, Poland has been defeated, and its country has collapsed. In the past, the Polish ruling class repeatedly boasted of the "stability" of its country and the "strength" of its army. However, this product of the Treaty of Versailles, a country that lived by oppressing non-Polish minorities, immediately disappeared without a trace after being successively attacked by the German army and the Red Army. Its traditional policy of unscrupulous wandering between the Soviet Union and Germany, provoking ill will between the two countries, has completely failed.</p>
<p>Third, we must admit that the outbreak of war in Europe has fundamentally changed the entire international situation. This war began with the German-Polish War and evolved into a war between Germany and Britain and France. The German-Polish War ended quickly due to the bankruptcy of the Polish rulers. The guarantees of Britain and France to Poland did not help Poland at all. In fact, no one knows what this kind of "guarantee" is. As for the war between Germany and Britain and France, it is currently in its initial stage and has not yet fully developed. But we can assert that this kind of war will inevitably cause fundamental changes to Europe and the world.</p>
<h3>Three Items on the Agenda of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Fifth Extraordinary Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened today in the Kremlin. The joint meeting of the Federal and National Councils was held that evening, chaired by Andrei Andreyev, Chairman of the Federal Council. Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Zhdanov, Khrushchev, Shvernik, and Beria took their seats, and the entire venue erupted in cheers. The delegation of representatives from the National Assembly of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus attending the plenary session was warmly welcomed by all the deputies. The joint meeting of the two councils passed the following agenda for this extraordinary plenary session: (1) Report on the government's foreign policy; (2) Declaration by the delegation of representatives from the National Assembly of Western Ukraine; (3) Declaration by the delegation of representatives from the National Assembly of Western Belarus.</p>
<p>After the resolution that all items on the agenda would be discussed at the joint meeting of the two councils, Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, began to report on the first item. (TASS dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Old Formulas No Longer Apply; Ideas Cannot Be Destroyed by Force</h3>
<p>serious mistakes occurred when judging the situation. For example, in the past few months, terms such as "aggression" and "aggressor" have acquired new concrete definitions and meanings. We obviously cannot continue to apply such terms with the meaning they had three or four months ago. As far as the European powers are concerned, Germany is now striving to end the war quickly and seek peace, while Britain and France, who yesterday still condemned aggression, are now advocating continuing the war and opposing peace. The British and French governments' obligations to Poland are clearly insufficient as a reason for this new position. Everyone knows that restoring the old Poland is no longer a problem, so it is inappropriate to continue the war for the reason of restoring Poland. The British and French governments also know this truth, but they are still unwilling to stop the war and make peace, and are looking for new excuses to continue the war against Germany. Recently, the British and French ruling classes have attempted to present themselves as defenders of democratic rights and opponents of Hitlerism. The British government has even declared that its purpose in waging war against Germany is only "to overthrow Hitlerism." The pro-war factions in Britain and France have clearly declared a war of an "ideological" nature against Germany, similar to the religious wars of ancient times. In the past, this kind of war of excluding dissidents was once popular, and the result was the extreme suffering of the people and the economic and cultural bankruptcy and degradation of various nations. This kind of war is a medieval war. Do the British and French ruling classes want us to return to the Middle Ages, to the superstitions and cultural degradation of religious wars? This kind of "ideological" war has now broken out, its scope is extremely broad, and its threat to the people of Europe and the world is extremely serious. But this war is completely unreasonable. People can accept or reject the ideas of Hitlerism, just as they do with any ideas. This is a matter of each person's political position. But everyone knows that ideas cannot be destroyed by force or eliminated by war. Therefore, it is not only meaningless but also a crime to carry out a war to "destroy Hitlerism" under the guise of fighting for "democracy." Moreover, how can the French government's dissolution of the Communist Party, the arrest of Communist deputies in the National Assembly, or the British government's restrictions on political freedom and oppression of the Indian people be called wars to defend democracy?</p>
<h3>Maintaining Democracy as a Shield; Britain and France Are Actually Fighting for Hegemony</h3>
<p>"From this point of view, the purpose of the current European war is definitely not as announced in the official declarations of Britain and France. It is definitely not to obtain democracy, but there is something else that these gentlemen are unwilling to declare frankly. The war between Britain and France against Germany is neither because Britain and France have sworn to restore Poland, nor to maintain democracy. The British and French ruling classes have their own motives for this war. The motive is also unrelated to ideology, but is in the material interests of their vast colonial empires. The British Empire itself has a population of only 47 million, but owns colonies with a population of 480 million. The French colonial empire itself has only 42 million people, while the colonies have a population of 70 million. Britain and France's ability to exploit tens of thousands of people with such vast colonies is the foundation of their world hegemony. However, Germany's national strength has been increasing in recent years due to the collapse of the Treaty of Versailles, and it has been thinking about getting involved in these colonies. This is the basic reason for the war between Britain and France against Germany. The British and French ruling classes are determined to wage war against Germany because they fear losing world hegemony.</p>
<p>"As mentioned above, the imperialist nature of this decisive war is obvious. Anyone who faces reality cannot deny this point. And it is even clearer who benefits from this kind of war to seize world hegemony. It is definitely not in the interests of the working class. For the working class, this war only brings sacrifice and suffering. Therefore, the meaning of terms such as "aggression" and "aggressor" has recently changed. Everyone should be able to judge for themselves. Everyone should be able to understand that if these terms are still applied with the old meaning before the political relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany changed and the European imperialist war broke out, the result will inevitably cause confusion in people's hearts and lead to wrong conclusions. In order to avoid this, we cannot adopt an uncritical attitude towards the old terms, because they do not apply to the new international situation.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Adopt Neutrality; Helping Germany to Achieve Peace</h3>
<p>"The above is a summary of recent international events. Below, I will outline the changes in the Soviet Union's own international position. These changes are very significant. We will only point out the most important points. Because of the consistent implementation of a peaceful foreign policy, our country's international position has been greatly enhanced. I mentioned earlier that our country's relations with Germany have been fundamentally improved. The relations between the two countries are developing along the lines of friendship, good neighborliness, and practical cooperation, and politically assisting Germany's peace movement. The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact stipulates that our country should maintain neutrality when Germany is at war. We have consistently implemented this line, and our army's entry into the former Polish territory on September 17 is not in conflict with this line. Moreover, our government issued a notification to all countries with diplomatic relations on the same day, stating that the Soviet Union will continue to adopt a neutral policy in its relations with all these countries. Our army's entry into Polish territory was after the collapse of the Polish state. Because Poland has collapsed, we encountered problems related to our national security. We certainly cannot remain neutral and indifferent. Our Ukrainian and Belarusian compatriots in the west were left to fate due to the collapse of Poland. Our government cannot sit idly by. "Subsequent events have confirmed that the foundation of the new relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany is extremely solid. Although the major issue of dividing the scope of interests between the two countries arose after the Red Army entered Poland, this issue was quickly resolved by mutual agreement between the two sides. After the signing of the German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Border Demarcation at the end of September, the relationship between the two countries was further consolidated.</p>
<p>"In the past twenty years, the relationship between Germany and the Western European bourgeois countries has been mainly dominated by Germany's efforts to break free from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. The creators of this treaty were Britain and France, and the United States also participated. This is the distant cause of the outbreak of the European war today. The foundation of the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany is completely different. The Soviet Union has no interest in maintaining the post-war Versailles system. We have consistently advocated that a strong Germany is a necessary condition for lasting peace in Europe. It is ridiculous to think that Germany can be destroyed so that it is not recorded in the books. The powers that dream this foolish dream have clearly forgotten the regrettable experience of Versailles, do not recognize the increasing national strength of Germany, and do not know that the attempt to reproduce Versailles in the current international situation, which is different from that in 1914, will result in them eating their own fruit. "We have consistently worked hard to improve relations with Germany and welcome Germany's similar efforts. Now this relationship has been established on the basis of friendship and good neighborliness. We are willing to support Germany's efforts to seek peace, and at the same time, we are willing to cooperate in developing economic relations between the two countries so that both sides benefit. Since the improvement of the political relationship between the two countries, the economic relationship has also greatly improved. The negotiations recently conducted by the German delegation in Moscow and the current negotiations conducted by our delegation in Germany are establishing a broad foundation for the development of Soviet-German trade.</p>
<h3>Occupying Polish Territory: Exaggerated Military Victory</h3>
<p>"I will continue to discuss everything about our army entering the former Polish territory. The process of this event need not be detailed, as you have already seen it in the newspapers. I will only mention the most important points. When Poland disintegrated, our government had to assist our Ukrainian and Belarusian compatriots in the west. This goes without saying. After the Red Army entered the two regions, it was warmly welcomed by the people. They recognized our army as liberators who helped them get rid of the shackles of Polish gentry, landlords, and capitalists. In some areas, the Red Army had major battles with the Polish army, resulting in considerable casualties. The numbers are as follows: 'On the Belarusian front, a total of 246 Red Army officers and soldiers were killed and 503 were wounded, totaling 749 casualties. On the Ukrainian front, 491 officers and soldiers were killed and 1,359 were wounded, totaling 1,850 casualties. In both regions, a total of 737 were killed and 1,862 were wounded, totaling 2,599 casualties. Our army seized war trophies in Poland, including over 900 cannons, over 10,000 machine guns, over 300,000 rifles, over 150 million rounds of rifle ammunition, over 1 million artillery shells, and 300 aircraft. The territory incorporated into the Soviet Union is equal in area to a major European country, including 108,000 square kilometers of Western Belarus, with a population of 4.8 million, and 88,000 square kilometers of Western Ukraine, with a population of 8 million. The total area of the two regions is 196,000 square kilometers, with a population of 13 million, including over 7 million Ukrainians, over 3 million Belarusians, over 1 million Poles, and over 1 million Jews.</p>
<p>"The political significance of the above events is extremely significant. Reports from Western Ukraine and Western Belarus state that the people unanimously and enthusiastically welcomed national liberation and the victory of the Soviet system. The recent universal, direct, equal, and secret ballot elections for the National Assembly, the first in the history of these two regions, proved that nine-tenths of their people had long wished to join the Soviet Union. The National Assemblies held in Lviv and Bialystok proved that all people's representatives were in complete agreement on all political issues.</p>
<h3>Commitment Not to Interfere in the Internal Affairs of the Three Baltic States</h3>
<p>"I will further discuss our relations with the Baltic states. Significant changes have also taken place in this regard. In the past, our country's diplomatic relations with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were based on the peace treaties concluded with each of these countries in 1920. These treaties made them independent countries. Since then, the Soviet Union has pursued a friendly policy towards them. This is very different from the policies of Imperial Russia, which oppressed small and weak nations, forbidding them to have independent national and political development, causing them deep resentment. The past twenty years of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the three countries have created favorable conditions for further improvement of political and other relations. Therefore, as a result of recent negotiations in Moscow with representatives of the three countries, mutual assistance pacts have been concluded separately. These pacts have great political significance. Their principles are completely the same, all being for the mutual assistance of the contracting parties, including military assistance when the countries are attacked. "The three countries have a special geographical location and are the gateway to the Soviet Union in the Baltic Sea. After the signing of these pacts, the Soviet Union can establish naval bases and airfields in designated locations in Estonia and Latvia, and jointly defend the borders of Lithuania. These naval bases and airfields, and the assigned Red Army forces stationed there to protect them, will not only protect the borders of the Soviet Union, but also protect the Baltic states, which is also beneficial to the maintenance of peace and the interests of the people. Our negotiations with the three countries proved that both sides had mutual trust and understanding of the necessity of military guarantees for mutual interests, and demonstrated that both sides were willing to maintain peace and protect the safety of the people engaged in peaceful activities. It is precisely for this reason that the negotiations for these historically significant mutual assistance pacts were successful. "The meaning of these pacts is not for the Soviet Union to interfere in the internal affairs of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as falsely claimed by some foreign newspapers. On the contrary, each pact clearly states the inviolability of the sovereignty of the contracting countries and the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The pacts mutually respect each other's political, social, and economic systems, and their purpose is to enhance the peaceful, friendly, and cooperative relations between the peoples of both sides. We will strictly abide by each pact in accordance with the principle of reciprocity. We should declare that all slanders about the Sovietization of the Baltic states are the provocations of our common enemies and anti-Soviet elements. Since our country improved political relations with the three countries, we have also met their economic needs. Recently, we have also signed commercial treaties with them separately, and as a result, our trade with these countries will increase several times, with the possibility of further increases in the future. "At a time when all European countries, including neutral countries, are experiencing trade difficulties, the economic agreements signed between our country and the three Baltic states are of great importance to these countries. Therefore, the restoration of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania will accelerate the development of agriculture, industry, and transportation, and benefit the people of the neighboring Baltic countries.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's policy toward small countries can be strongly illustrated by the agreement to return Vilnius to the Republic of Lithuania. As a result of the establishment of this agreement, the Lithuanian state, with a population of 2.5 million, has expanded its land, and the population has increased by 550,000. At the same time, Vilnius was also returned, and the city's population is several times larger than the current Lithuanian capital. The Soviet Union agreed to return Vilnius to Lithuania, not because the majority of the city's population is Lithuanian. In fact, the majority of the population of Vilnius is not Lithuanian. The Soviet side considered that the city, which was seized by Polish force, should still be a Lithuanian city. The city has close ties with Lithuania's past history and Lithuania's aspirations. Foreign newspapers have pointed out that this kind of fact that a large country voluntarily returns a large city to a small country has no precedent in world history. Therefore, the Soviet Union's move has fully demonstrated its goodwill.</p>
<h3>Special Relationship with Finland: Concerning National Security</h3>
<p>Our relationship with Finland is very special. This is due to the strong influence of a third power in Finland. However, fair-minded people should recognize that the issue of Soviet security (especially Leningrad) was mentioned in the past in the Soviet-Finnish talks, and will be reviewed in the current Soviet-Finnish negotiations. In a certain sense, this relationship concerning Soviet security is extremely acute. Because Leningrad, in addition to Moscow, is the most important city in the Soviet Union, and the city is located only 32 kilometers from the Finnish border. In other words, the distance between Leningrad and the foreign border is so short that modern artillery can reach it. On the other hand, the sea route from Finland to Leningrad is also very close. Therefore, Finland's attitude toward the Soviet Union, whether it is friendly or hostile, is extremely important. Finland now owns the entire north shore of the Gulf of Finland and the islands in the middle of the Gulf of Finland.</p>
<p>In view of the above circumstances, and the current situation in Europe, Finland is expected to show the necessary understanding. What is the basis of Soviet-Finnish relations in the past few years? As you know, the basis of this relationship is the peace agreement established in 1920, which is similar in nature to the one we signed with other Baltic neighbors. The Soviet Union automatically guaranteed the independent survival of Finland. Undoubtedly, only the Soviet Union, which recognizes the principle of national freedom and development, can take such action. At the same time, only the Soviet government dares to tolerate Finland, which is maintaining its independence near the gateway to Leningrad. Regarding this point, it can be proved by the experience that Finland gained from the "Kerensky" and "Tsereteli" "democratic governments." As for the governments of Lvov and Milyukov, and the government of Imperial Russia, they are even more out of the question. There is no doubt that these important circumstances will become an excellent foundation for improving Soviet-Finnish relations. As for the concern for peace, Finland is no less than the Soviet Union. The recent Soviet-Finnish negotiations were initiated by us. What is the theme of the negotiations? The major powers in the center of Europe are brewing the most terrible war. In this international situation, the Soviet Union has no choice but to take strict measures to protect its security. Regarding this point, since the Gulf of Finland and the land are extremely close to Leningrad, the Soviet Union's special attention is also reasonable.</p>
<h3>Recognizing the Demands as Reasonable: Hoping for Finnish Understanding</h3>
<p>The population of Leningrad has now increased to 1.35 million, which is almost equal to the entire population of Finland, which is 3.65 million. There is no need to further discuss the stories spread by foreign newspapers about the Soviet-Finnish negotiations.</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>Some newspapers even said that the Soviet Union was demanding the city of Vyborg and the northern part of Lake Ladoga, which is a pure lie. Another newspaper claimed that the Soviet Union was demanding that Finland cede the island of Älänsaari, which is also a pure fabrication. At the same time, there are even more rumors about the Soviet Union's demands on Sweden and Norway. The absurdity of these rumors is too great to be refuted. In fact, the proposals we have made to Finland are extremely fair, and these proposals are also the minimum measures to ensure Soviet security and maintain Soviet-Finnish relations. We have already begun negotiations with the representatives sent by Finland, including Paasikivi. We have suggested to them to sign a Soviet-Finnish mutual assistance pact, which is similar in nature to the mutual assistance agreements we have established with other Baltic countries. However, since the Finnish government stated that this agreement would affect its neutrality, we did not insist. We then proceeded to discuss the issue of Soviet security (especially Leningrad). We suggested establishing an agreement to move the Soviet-Finnish border in the Karelian Isthmus to a location 100 kilometers north of Leningrad. In exchange, we would transfer a part of Soviet Karelia to Finland. The area of Soviet Karelia is several times larger than the area ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also suggested to Finland to establish an agreement stipulating that Finland would lease a small part of the Gulf of Finland to the Soviet Union for a fixed period of time, so that the Soviet Union could establish a naval base there. According to the Soviet-Estonian mutual assistance agreement, the Soviet Union has already established a naval base in the southern part of the Gulf of Finland (i.e., the Baltic Sea coast). The establishment of a naval base in the northern part of the Gulf of Finland will surely guarantee the entire Gulf of Finland, so that it will not be invaded by foreign enemies. We are convinced that the establishment of this naval base will benefit not only the Soviet Union but also Finland. As for our other suggestions, especially the suggestion to exchange certain islands in the Gulf of Finland and the Rybachiy Peninsula and the Sredny Peninsula for Soviet Karelia (the latter being several times larger in area than the former), the Finnish side has not objected. However, other disagreements have not yet been resolved. Although the Finnish side has now agreed to cede a part of the Karelian Isthmus, it is still of no avail. At the same time, we have taken new steps to find a solution. We have stated that if our main proposals are accepted by the Finnish side, we will no longer oppose the fortification of Älänsaari. We only put forward one condition, that the fortification of Älänsaari should be carried out by Finland itself, and no third country (including the Soviet Union) should participate. We further suggested that Finland request the removal of the defensive fortifications on the Soviet-Finnish border (in the Karelian Isthmus), and stated that this move would surely benefit the Finnish state.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also stated our hope for adding mutual assistance guarantee clauses to the Soviet-Finnish non-aggression treaty. Finally, the consolidation of Soviet-Finnish political relations will surely become the basis for the progress of economic relations between the two countries. From this point of view, we are prepared to seek a solution to all the points that we are concerned about with Finland. Therefore, we do not believe that the Finnish government will seek some excuse to hinder the establishment of the currently proposed agreement. This kind of action violates the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland, and the harm to Finland is also extremely great. We firmly believe that the Finnish leaders will recognize the necessity of consolidating the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland, and that the Finnish people will surely reject anti-Soviet forces and incitement.</p>
<h3>The United States Interferes: Mocking Its Meddlesomeness</h3>
<p>"Regarding the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, the US President has now even intervened. This is inconsistent with the US policy of neutrality. On October 12, President Roosevelt sent a telegram to Kalinin, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, hoping that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland could be maintained and further developed. This telegram makes people believe that the relationship between the United States and the Philippines and Cuba is better than the relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland. In fact, the Philippines has requested independence but has not been granted, while Finland has long been granted freedom and independence. Comrade Kalinin immediately replied to Mr. Roosevelt, stating, "I respectfully request that your president pay attention to the fact that the Soviet Union recognized the political independence of Finland as early as December 31, 1917, and Finnish sovereignty was guaranteed in the peace agreement established between Russia and Finland on October 10, 1920. This move by the Soviet Union has explained the basic principles of the Soviet Union's relationship with Finland. The current negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland are based on these basic principles, and their sole purpose is to consolidate the relations between the two countries and strengthen mutual cooperation to jointly strive for the security of both countries." "Since the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has given such a clear reply, the Finnish government should accept our proposals. Our proposals are the minimum measures, and they will not only not harm the national interests of Finland, but will also enhance its security, so that the Finnish side can establish a stronger foundation for economic and political relations with us.</p>
<h3>Turkey Takes a Dangerous Path: Soon to Bite Off More Than It Can Chew</h3>
<p>There is little to report regarding our negotiations with Turkey. There are many rumors abroad about these negotiations. Some parties even said that the Soviet Union was demanding that Turkey cede Ardahan and Kars. This kind of rumor is a pure fabrication. Others spread rumors that the Soviet Union was demanding to change the international treaties established in Montreux and demanding to obtain favorable positions in the straits. "This is also a fabricated lie. In fact, what was discussed was the issue of concluding a bilateral mutual assistance pact limited to the Black Sea and the straits area. The Soviet Union determined that First, the conclusion of this pact must not involve the Soviet Union in actions that would lead to armed conflict with Germany. Second, the Soviet Union wanted the following guarantee, that in the event of a threat of war, Turkey would not allow warships of non-Black Sea countries to pass through the Bosphorus Strait and enter the Black Sea. Turkey rejected these two conditions, and therefore the conclusion of the pact was impossible. "The Soviet-Turkish negotiations failed to sign a pact, but at least it was enough to clarify several political issues that we wanted to know. In the current international situation, it is particularly important to recognize the true face and policies of countries that have significant relations with us. Regarding Turkey's policy, we now fully understand many parts of it, not only because of the Moscow negotiations, but also because of the recent diplomatic actions of the Turkish government. The Turkish government's decision has linked the country's fate with the "certain warring parties" in the current war in Europe, that is, signing a mutual assistance pact with the United Kingdom and France, which have been at war with Germany for two months. In this way, Turkey has definitely abandoned its prudent policy of neutrality and joined the arena of right and wrong in the expanded European war. This move is naturally welcomed by the United Kingdom and France, who are striving to attract neutral countries to join their side as much as possible. Whether Turkey will regret this in the future, we will not predict. We must only remember the new factors in our neighbor's foreign policy and pay close attention to the development of events.</p>
<p>"Since Turkey has already taken a dangerous path to support a certain warring party to some extent, its government obviously knows the responsibilities it bears as a result. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is not like this, and as a result, it has had many successes in diplomacy in the past. In the future, the Soviet Union will stand aside and continue to consistently implement a policy of neutrality, not only not helping to expand the war, but also striving to support the movement to restore peace. We firmly believe that our country's consistent policy of peace will surely have good results in the future. We will also implement this policy in the Black Sea region, and we firmly believe that it will surely guarantee that it is normally adapted to the interests of the Soviet Union, as well as the interests of countries that are in harmony with the Soviet Union's wishes.</p>
<h3>Improving Soviet-Japanese Relations: Depending on Japan's Sincerity</h3>
<p>"Next is our relationship with Japan. There has been some improvement in Soviet-Japanese relations recently. The signs of this improvement can be seen in the agreement to stop the conflict on the Mongolian-Manchurian border, which was signed in Moscow recently. From May to mid-September this year, Japanese-Manchurian forces and Soviet-Mongolian forces clashed in the Nomonhan area of the Manchurian-Mongolian border. During this period, various weapons, including aircraft and heavy artillery, were used. The fighting was sometimes extremely fierce. The cause of the conflict was Japan's attempt to seize a part of the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic and forcibly change the Manchurian-Mongolian border. This kind of unilateral action method will inevitably cause resolute resistance, and its application to the Soviet Union and its allies is completely useless, which has now been proved again. The unfortunate fate of Poland proves how unreliable the mutual assistance pacts signed by a certain powerful country in Europe are, but the facts that occurred on the Mongolian border prove how valuable the mutual assistance pacts signed by the Soviet Union are. "This conflict stopped after the Soviet-Japanese agreement was signed in Moscow on September 15. Border peace has been completely restored. In this way, the first step in the improvement of Soviet-Japanese relations has been taken. The second step is to organize a joint committee of Soviet-Mongolian and Japanese-Manchurian representatives to review certain disputes regarding the border. If the other party is also sincere, there will surely be good results in the future.</p>
<p>"In addition, the possibility of Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations has also begun. The development of Soviet-Japanese trade is beneficial to both sides. In summary, we can have reason to declare that the improvement of our country's relations with Japan has already begun. It is still difficult for us to predict how rapid this trend will develop. We do not know the extent of the Japanese side's preparedness. As far as we are concerned, we welcome this kind of lobbying from the Japanese side, and we will approach it based on our country's basic political stance and concern for peace.</p>
<h3>Denouncing British and American Policies: Sufficient to Prolong the War</h3>
<p>"Finally, I will briefly describe a few words on the issue of contraband of war and the export of armaments by neutral countries to belligerent countries. The Soviet Union recently sent a letter to the United Kingdom, replying to its memoranda of September 6 and 11. The originals have all been published. Our memorandum explained our country's views on the issue of contraband of war, stating that the Soviet government does not recognize food, fuel for non-combatant people, and clothing as contraband of war, and believes that prohibiting the export of consumer goods is tantamount to forcing women, children, the elderly, and the weak into hunger and cold. The Soviet government also declared that this kind of problem cannot be decided unilaterally by the United Kingdom, but must be agreed upon jointly by all countries. We hope that the public opinion of neutral countries and the United Kingdom and France will recognize the fairness of our stance, and find a way to prevent the war between the armies of the belligerent countries from becoming a war of slaughtering the elderly, the weak, women, and children.</p>
<p>"In short, our country, as a neutral country, does not want the war to expand, and therefore takes all steps to make the destruction of the war lighter and end sooner, thereby seeking peace. From this point of view, the decision of the US government to lift the ban on the export of armaments to belligerent countries inevitably raises doubts. The impact of this decision obviously cannot lighten the war or promote its early end. On the contrary, it will make it more serious and prolong it. This decision is of great benefit to the US arms industry, but this is not enough to be the reason for the United States to open up the arms ban, of course not. "As described above, this is the current international situation and the principles of Soviet foreign policy." (A TASS dispatch)</p>
<h3>Different Perceptions in Various Countries</h3>
<p>London</p>
<p>The main points of today's commentaries in various newspapers here all focus on the Soviet Union's decision to maintain neutrality. The "Daily Mail" stated that Hitler once said that Molotov's speech would be a turning point in the war, and he must now feel extremely disappointed. Mr. Molotov's speech has proved that it is not as Mr. Hitler imagined. Its main argument is neutrality. The "Daily Herald" said that Germany handed over the Baltic Sea to Stalin, and the reward it got was nothing but empty words. Hitler had requested the Soviet Union to compensate with aircraft and submarines, but Stalin only replied with a speech. (A Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>All newspapers here believe that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech in the Supreme Soviet last night must have disappointed Hitler. Mrs. Tabouis stated in "L'Oeuvre" that although Molotov seemed to have confirmed the friendship between the Soviet Union and Germany, it was obviously not what Berlin had hoped for. Bertin also published an article in "L'Ordre," stating that it is quite obvious that the Soviet Union will maintain neutrality. Hitler can no longer vainly hope for unknowable benefits. The future relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union is difficult to foresee. (A Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>Today, the "New York Times" stated that the changes in the Italian cabinet and the speech of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov both have a significant impact on the war. Germany's old and new partners are taking this opportunity to reiterate their conservative neutrality. Hitler cannot gain much comfort from Molotov's speech, because the entire tone of Molotov contains the Soviet Union's only interest, which is to take advantage of the war to strengthen its own position and expand its international influence. The goals of both Italy and the Soviet Union are to take advantage of Hitler's war with other countries to seize opportunities and gain benefits. (A Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>Today, all evening newspapers in Tokyo published Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech in the Supreme Soviet yesterday in large print, and especially paid attention to the section mentioning Soviet-Japanese relations. Some newspapers even wrote short commentaries. The "Asahi Shimbun" said that Japan is fully prepared to adjust its relations with the Soviet Union, but only if the Soviet Union shows a sincere expression to it. The "Hochi Shimbun" reported that Molotov has made a gesture of shaking hands with Japan, but it is not known whether he is referring to the left hand or the right hand. The "Kokumin Shimbun" also stated that Molotov's condemnation of the "isms" war of the United Kingdom and France is worthy of attention, and that Molotov, who is represented by the government, is generally recognized as the initiator of worldwide red propaganda.

<h3>A British Cargo Ship Sinks After Hitting a Mine</h3>
<p>London According to a notice issued by the Information Department last night, the British cargo ship "Plemona" sank after a mine exploded in the waters northeast of Scotland yesterday. Three crew members died, and the other 41 landed in Dover. (An Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>New York According to a message from Mackay Radio Station, a ship of unknown nationality received a distress call about 400 miles northeast of Bermuda, containing the word "submarine". This call was issued to a certain British ship, but there was no response. It is reported that a US Coast Guard ship has rushed to the scene of the accident, and is expected to arrive there this afternoon. (A Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Western Front – Minor Skirmishes at the Forefront – French Forces Shoot Down a German Plane from Their Defense Line</h3>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 115, stating, "Our reconnaissance teams and enemy teams were quite active today between the Moselle and Saar rivers, with occasional attacks. In addition, our air forces engaged in numerous battles with the enemy air force yesterday. A German reconnaissance plane was shot down over our lines, and two others were forced to land in enemy territory in the Saar region. All our aircraft have safely returned to base." (Havas wire, 31st)</p>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 116, stating, "Very little activity on either side last night." (Havas news agency, 1st)</p>
<p>Luxembourg – This morning and yesterday, there was extensive aircraft activity around the Luxembourg border. Several aircraft flew over Luxembourg's airspace. (Reuters wire, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German News Agency stated that German forces recently crossed the border to reconnoiter positions in front of the Maginot Line and discovered abandoned trench systems and machine-gun nests in a deserted village that German forces had previously abandoned. These German forces encountered no enemy fire and obtained some abandoned war equipment before retreating. The news agency also admitted that this reconnaissance occurred several days ago but did not know the exact date. (Reuters news agency, 1st)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters special correspondent accompanying the Royal Air Force in France described how a British fighter plane shot down a German twin-engine reconnaissance plane over a secret British airfield behind the Maginot Line as follows: After the British fighter plane discovered the German plane, it ascended to pursue it. The German plane accelerated to escape, but the British plane fired upward with its machine guns from below, firing 400 rounds continuously. The German plane was hit and crashed to the ground, its nose buried about nine feet deep. The fuel tank exploded with a loud noise, and the fuselage immediately caught fire and was destroyed. All the pilots were killed. According to the British fighter pilot, it was as easy as shooting down a pigeon. (Reuters wire, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to an official report published here, "There was artillery fire and reconnaissance activity on the Western Front. Yesterday, a total of eight enemy planes were shot down on the Western Front and the North Sea, four of which were British planes." (Haitong wire, 1st)</p>
<h3>US House Discusses Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>Washington – The House decided today to immediately send the Neutrality Act to a joint House-Senate committee to reconcile the discrepancies in the bill. President Roosevelt has thus won a victory in the first test of strength in the House. The bill was passed by the Senate last Friday. (Reuters wire, 31st)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Announces Naval Plan</h3>
<p>Washington – US President Roosevelt, while hosting reporters at the White House, announced detailed plans for expanding naval bases and establishing new steel mills on the West Coast. He stated that in addition to establishing naval bases at San Pedro and Puget Sound, a large-scale naval base would also be established in San Francisco. To avoid transporting steel from the East via rail or the Panama Canal to the West, steel mills would be established on the West Coast, using Western ore, to save transportation time from the eastern United States to the West. President Roosevelt pointed out that coal would also not need to be supplied from the East because the hydropower of the Western states could generate electricity for use in iron-smelting furnaces. (Haitong wire, 1st)</p>
<h3>Flint Crew Safety Issue – Request for British and German Responsibility</h3>
<p>Washington – It is announced here that the US government has notified the British and German governments that the safety of the crew of the American cargo ship "City of Flint" must be the responsibility of the British and German governments. (Haitong wire, 1st)</p>

<p>Tokyo – After the Asian Development Board's meeting concluded today, Cabinet Secretary Hayato announced a statement saying that the movement to establish a "new central government" in China is now progressing smoothly. Today's meeting of the Asian Development Board discussed the attitudes and policies that Japan should adopt in response to this new change in the overall situation. It is heard that the Asian Development Board's resolution will be submitted to the Cabinet meeting on Thursday for approval and then reported by Prime Minister Abe to the Emperor. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Asian Development Board held a meeting at the Prime Minister's residence at 10:00 this morning to complete its consideration of Japan's policy toward the future "new central government" in China. Its resolution will be submitted to the Cabinet meeting for approval tomorrow, and then Prime Minister Abe will report this resolution to the Emperor. Today's meeting was chaired by Abe, and the Vice President of the Board, Foreign Minister Nomura, Army Minister Hata Shunroku, Navy Minister Yoshida, and Finance Minister Aoki all attended. During the meeting, the Prime Minister pointed out that the time for "establishing a new central government" in China has now matured and asked the attendees to discuss the specific plans for this matter. Subsequently, Secretary-General Yanagawa gave a detailed report on the plan formulated by the Asian Development Board, and then opinions were exchanged, and it was unanimously decided to "cooperate as much as possible and establish a new government on that basis. The Japanese government will actively assist the movement to establish a new government, and any attempt by others to obstruct this movement will be strictly prevented." (Reuters wire, 1st)</p>

<h3>War Time European March (Continued) – London Special Correspondent – Shu Di</h3>
<p>What kind of arrangement, estimation, and determination did Hitler use to take such a significant and unconventional action?</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union were a capitalist country, then without a doubt, Hitler would be determined to "divide" Polish territory with the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union is a country with a socialist structure, and there is no need to seize colonies. In particular, a territory as poor as the eastern half of Poland would be a great burden if the Soviet Union took it for itself without adopting the exploitative relationship between imperialism and colonies. Also, in the tacit understanding of this "Soviet-German Agreement," if both parties had completely determined to divide Poland into two parts, one belonging to Germany and the other to the Soviet Union, then Hitler would have been confident and would not have to worry about future Soviet-German relations, and therefore could use force. However, in the previous section (2), I have already said that this time, the Soviet Union and Germany only had a very vague tacit understanding regarding Poland, which was: in any case, a buffer zone must be left between the two countries, but there was no tacit understanding regarding specific boundaries. Even in the current situation with so many rumors in Europe, we have not heard anything about the specific boundaries of the future Soviet-German buffer zone in Poland. – This is a very noteworthy point.</p>
<p>If the two "if" assumptions mentioned in the previous paragraph existed, then we could immediately conclude that Hitler's invasion of Poland was entirely due to the formation of the Soviet-German Agreement. However, precisely because these two situations do not exist, Hitler's actions this time need to be investigated more deeply.</p>
<p>The actual situation is: rather than saying that Hitler suddenly had the idea to invade Poland because of the signing of the "Soviet-German Agreement," it is more accurate to say that he signed the "Soviet-German Agreement" in order to invade Poland. If we were to draw a simple formula to illustrate this, I think it could be drawn in the following chronological order: –</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and Germany begin buffer negotiations. At the time, the goal on the German side was to attempt to break up the British-French-Soviet negotiations; on the Soviet side, it was to serve as a second step in case negotiations with Britain and France failed, and at the same time, to promote the early completion of an alliance with Britain and France. The issue of Poland was not the object of Soviet-German negotiations at the time. The Polish issue expanded, and Hitler decided to invade Poland. Taking advantage of the failure of the British-French-Soviet negotiations, he intensified secret negotiations with the Soviet Union. With dramatic speed, Ribbentrop went to Moscow to formally sign the non-aggression pact. Finally, Poland was forced to submit, and Germany hesitated one last time. Germany began the invasion.</p>
<p>The first stage in this formula probably took several months and did not make much progress. The following five stages probably occurred in less than two months. I would like to add one more note: At the same time as the second stage was taking place, there was also constant contact between Italy and Poland. Because this point has a very close relationship with the relationship between the "Soviet-German Agreement" and the "German invasion of Poland," we must keep it in mind when studying the relationship between these two events.</p>
<p>This is a truly extremely complex situation! Carelessness can easily lead to being unconsciously blinded by propaganda from one side, and ultimately, the situation can be confused due to the inadequate use of language. I hope that my brief descriptions can avoid these two shortcomings, but I myself am not sure if I have already achieved this.</p>
<p>In any case, Germany has already invaded Poland. Now let's return to the event of "invading Poland" itself.</p>
<p>The event of "invading Poland" has many implications and extremely complex content. Hitler would never have taken this great risk without equally thorough estimates and the greatest determination.</p>
<p>First of all, we must say that until Britain and France declared war on Germany, Hitler was still expecting Poland to surrender to Germany. Germany's calculation was that in the east, it had removed the greatest reliable assistance. In the south, with the very rapid assistance of Mussolini, it had already obtained the complete neutrality of the Balkan countries. Now, Poland was geographically surrounded on three sides and trapped in the German net. And Western European British and French assistance was absolutely impossible in the short term. In this situation, Germany calculated that when Poland suffered one or two major military blows, it would be entirely possible to force it to surrender. Therefore, Italy did not participate in the war. This means that even when Germany and Poland had already opened fire, diplomacy between Germany and Poland was still continuing through the side door of Italy.</p>
<p>As of the writing of this section today, Britain and France have long since declared war, and this German estimate has completely failed. In terms of diplomatic operations, Hitler can be said to have suffered a defeat. However, to understand the entire evolution of the situation, it is still necessary to look back at Germany's desire in case Poland surrendered at this point. If Poland surrendered, the major premise, of course, would be to accept the so-called "Sixteen Points," the next step would be to cancel the "British-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement" and the "French-Polish Mutual Assistance Treaty," and the next step would be for Poland to join the German-Italian-Spanish bloc to confront Britain and France together. If this attempt were to be realized, then before long, German and Italian demands for British and French colonies would be brought up again, and the reactionary factions in Britain would be lured into the trap of attacking the Soviet Union again. In other words, apart from the fact that German and Italian strength would have increased again, the European diplomatic situation would more or less have returned to its old state.</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was desperately trying to help Germany with this plan.</p>
<p>This is Germany's most ideal ending. If we were to give it a name, it could probably be: "A Slight War and a Victory."</p>
<p>However, Britain and France finally declared war. Hitler also had considerable expectations and preparations for this when he decided to use force against Poland. This means that Germany still has to continue writing this unfinished article.</p>
<p>In this second stage, there are three difficulties facing Hitler: first, after the illusion of a compromise with Poland was shattered, the next question was how to decisively and thoroughly defeat the Polish army in the shortest possible time. This means that the Polish army, which was relatively well-equipped, relatively well-trained, and numbered around 1.5 million, had to be resolved before Hitler hoped for any other steps. Second, the problem of how Germany should respond on the Western Front after Britain and France joined the war. Third, the problem of relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Now we know that Germany has now decided that it will take a completely defensive stance on the Western Front. Its "Siegfried" defense line is probably quite solid, and it would be quite difficult to break through it. At the same time, we also know that this line of defense is much longer than France's "Maginot" line, meaning that Germany can avoid the "Maginot" line and break into France through Belgium; France, in order to avoid the "Siegfried" line, the only way to break into Germany is to go through Switzerland, but there is the natural barrier of the Jura Mountains here. That being said, moving heavy troops to the Eastern Front this time is actually taking considerable risks. Of course, the major premise is that he does not believe that Britain and France will launch a large-scale offensive; secondly, he has another magic weapon, which is Italy's non-participation in the war. In order to avoid triggering Italy's participation in the war, Britain and France will probably not launch a large-scale offensive. (Hitler estimated this.) But there is another very obvious fact: if France attacks Germany through Switzerland, then without a doubt, it will irritate Mussolini. As for the large-scale battles between the "Siegfried" and "Maginot" lines, Hitler is prepared to deal with them. The remaining problem is the British naval blockade. On this point, first of all, it is again Italy's non-participation in the war. The British blockade, no matter what, cannot be complete. Italian ports in the Mediterranean Sea are loopholes for German goods and raw materials. Secondly, the war against Poland is a land and air battle and has little to do with the navy. Germany adopted a policy of defeat from the very beginning in its naval warfare against Britain and France and had no illusions at all. The only countermeasure is submarines, just causing trouble.</p>
<p>The future relationship with the Soviet Union is the most troublesome thing for Hitler. Of course, he has always claimed that attacking "communism" is a mission given by Heaven and has proclaimed himself as the savior of the world from "Bolshevism," but now he has to turn around and put on a smiling face to the Kremlin. This is certainly not a very comfortable mood. However, compared to the frustration of his exaggerated ego, there is another thing that really worries him: that is, the question of the Soviet Union's attitude in case the war against Poland expands and is prolonged. To be blunt, if the war is prolonged, the Soviet Union has the possibility of participating directly or indirectly. In other words, if the war expands and continues, Germany is very likely to be forced to end the war against Poland hastily. Comparing the two evils and taking the lesser of the two, which road to take between a Polish surrender and a Soviet war, anyone with a little intelligence at that time could know. Moreover, in order to avoid being forced into that predicament at the crossroads, Hitler's only effective move is to quickly and thoroughly resolve Poland; on the other hand, he must continue to put on the smiling face he is putting on for Moscow.

<h3>Jiangsu Province's Post-War Education Funding Tightens – Province-Wide Education Revenue Only Reaches 40% of Pre-War Levels – Education Department Plans to Rectify Revenue and Curtail Expenditure</h3>
<p>(Taixian News) Since the August 13th Incident, a large part of Jiangsu Province has fallen into enemy hands, so education revenue has been greatly reduced, making it difficult to maintain support. However, the Education Department has planned to increase funding and save on expenditures. The details of the Education Department's funding situation are explored as follows:</p>
<p>Province-Wide Education Funding</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province's education funding was originally very abundant. The provincial education expenditure budget for the 26th year (1937) included 346,744 yuan for educational administration fees, 436,808 yuan for higher education fees, 3,174,313 yuan for general education fees, 471,060 yuan for social education fees, 100,000 yuan for study abroad funds, 153,600 yuan for subsidies, 750,000 yuan for promoting compulsory education, 713,290 yuan for various temporary fees, and 256,000 yuan for debt repayment, totaling 6,401,815 yuan. The amount can be said to be quite large. However, after the 27th year (1938), most of the counties south of the Yangtze River fell into enemy hands, leading to extreme difficulties. In the first half of the 27th year, provincial education special funds revenue, according to statistics from 31 counties, calculated at a discounted rate, amounted to only about 347,661 yuan. In the expenditure items for the 27th year, excluding educational administration fees, the first half was 268,144 yuan, and the second half was 98,416 yuan. The budget for the 28th year (1939) also failed to increase. The state of exhaustion can be easily imagined. This cannot but rely on subsidies from the central government.</p>
<p>County Education Funding</p>
<p>As for county education funding, the total number of county education budgets in the 26th year was 11,220,861 yuan. Although the education administration and operation expenses of various counties were issued at an 80% rate in October of the 26th year due to the tense war situation, the general compulsory social education expenses were still paid according to the old practice without any reduction. In the spring of the 27th year, the general compulsory social education expenses of various counties were still paid according to the original budget practice. If local finances were difficult, the payment would be reduced according to the situation. A separate tight budget was prepared for the education bureau administration and operation expenses of various counties. In the second half of the 27th year, another decision was made to recompile a tight budget for the education budgets of various counties. A total of two tight budgets were compiled in the 27th year.</p>
<p>Rectification Plan</p>
<p>The provincial education department believes that education funding is so exhausted. In the current process of resistance war, it can only strive for a balance between revenue and expenditure and self-sufficiency. It has already made overall plans. In terms of expenditure, it first emphasizes cost reduction and then rectifies revenue. Regarding cost reduction, it strives for a balance between revenue and expenditure in the provincial and county education budgets, strictly implements tight budgets in the provincial and county education budgets, determines the principles for revenue and expenditure in the occupied areas, and restricts new projects and construction purchases. Regarding the rectification of revenue, it will investigate school properties, rectify school rents, determine the standards for education fee collection, and clean up the financial assets of provincial and county education agencies. All of these efforts are aimed at seeking remedies under the goal of balancing revenue and expenditure and self-sufficiency to avoid the crisis of educational funding depletion in the future.</p>
<h3>A Review and Prospect of Public Education Centers (3)</h3>
<p>— Chen Lijiang</p>
<p>II. Future Prospects</p>
<p>The difficulties and shortcomings of the future path Public Education Centers have been described above. We should always actively try to overcome and remedy those difficulties and shortcomings. We cannot give up eating because of choking, or retreat from difficulties. The Public Education Center, as an educational institution, is very suitable for our country, which has a low level of culture and tight education funding. Because in countries with low levels of culture and tight education funding, on the one hand, there is no large amount of money to run various separately established educational institutions; on the other hand, the public needs ordinary education in their actual lives more urgently than specialized education. Furthermore, this kind of comprehensive facility is a collection of various undertakings, and its educational effect is naturally more powerful than separate establishments. At the same time, it is the center of public education implementation, so its strength is naturally greater than that of decentralized facilities, and it can also avoid various disadvantages of separate establishments. I believe that future Public Education Centers should take the following paths:</p>
<p>(1) The main purpose of the Public Education Center is not to run the center, but to run public education, to educate the public, to trigger their new understanding of life and new concepts of society, to create a new life and create a new society. In other words, the target of the Public Education Center is "people," not "things." Running the center without running education is "teaching things" instead of "teaching people." This is what we should take as a warning.</p>
<p>(2) The various facilities of the Public Education Center must be adapted to people, events, times, and places. We cannot excessively prescribe a fixed form. Therefore, the Ministry of Education only formulates a work outline. The education departments of each province and city should formulate the central work and its details of the Public Education Center in each province and city according to the work outline. Each Public Education Center should formulate its own business plan and work calendar according to the central work and its details.</p>
<p>(3) The teaching method of the Public Education Center should take the organization and training of the public as the highest principle, and all education should be attached to the public organization and training, so that they can obtain strong unity in group life and the spirit of seeking happiness for the masses. Only in this way can the public organization and training generate power, and education and public life can be integrated.</p>
<p>(4) In the internal organization of the Public Education Center, it is not necessary to set up all four groups in county and city Public Education Centers with insufficient funding. We should seek convenience in work. Even setting up only a guidance group is not impossible. We must avoid hindering the development of the enterprise due to the organization.</p>
<p>(5) The staff of the Public Education Center is extremely important. The success or failure of the Public Education Center is inherently related to the system, but its main body is the staff. Therefore, carefully selecting personnel is the only way out for rectifying and revitalizing the Public Education Center. When carefully selecting, we must pay attention to their personality, spirit, belief, and enthusiasm. After they are selected, we must pay attention to the assessment and further training of their work, and the business they run will naturally flourish.</p>
<p>(6) The amount of funding for the Public Education Center, generally speaking, should be at least 2,000 yuan per center per year. In places with insufficient funding, social education institutions such as libraries and sports fields should be merged into the Public Education Center. In terms of equipment, the central and provincial education administrative organs should try to provide subsidies as much as possible. Furthermore, the ideal Public Education Center should be a production machine that can be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>(7) The Public Education Center is not an omnipotent institution. At the same time, the society is so large that our manpower and funding cannot be omnipotent. Therefore, if we want it to be effective, we must pay more attention to contact and utilization. Contact means cooperation, and utilization means borrowing other forces. Both are beneficial to oneself and others. At the same time, we must know that our purpose is to seek the welfare of the public and promote society. As long as we can achieve this purpose, even if we work hard and endure hardship, some sacrifices are worthwhile. What is especially important is that we should not be greedy for credit when cooperating, and we should not be reckless when borrowing other forces, so that we can receive great support.</p>
<p>(8) The final destination of the Public Education Center is to make it a public education center, a public-owned education center. Therefore, all kinds of work should pay as much attention as possible to cultivating the public's automatic ability and spirit, so that it can be self-reliant, self-help, self-governing, and self-run. Only in this way can this undertaking truly become the public's own undertaking.</p>
<p>If we can do it according to the above-mentioned paths, I dare say that the Public Education Center is not only a rational system for transforming old education and creating new education, but also the active force for transforming the old society and creating the new society.</p>

<h3>Grass Court Club Decides to Invite Philippine Davis Cup Players for Exhibition Matches: Anson and Sanchez Pass Through Shanghai, Ponséck's Performance Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Europe's top player and Yugoslavia's Davis Cup representative, Ponséck, along with British Davis Cup main player Hale, were invited by the Philippine Sports Association to perform in Manila. At the same time, the Philippine Davis Cup representatives Anson and Sanchez will also return from the United States. The Philippine tennis stars and European famous players will pass through Shanghai one after another this month. This is a great opportunity that is hard to come by again. The Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Club has been in correspondence with the Philippine Sports Association, inviting them to perform when passing through Shanghai. According to Mr. Spike, the secretary of the Grass Court Club, yesterday morning, Anson and Sanchez will arrive in Shanghai on the President Coolidge on the 7th of this month, scheduled to berth at 10:00 AM, and return to the Philippines on the same ship at 5:30 PM the following afternoon, staying in Shanghai for one and a half days. They have also agreed to perform a second time in Shanghai. As for Ponséck and Hale, according to a telegram from the Philippines, they will arrive in Manila on the 27th of this month, which means that the estimated time to pass through Shanghai will be around the 22nd of this month. Whether they can perform in Shanghai at that time, although the negotiation has not made special progress, there is hope that the wish may be fulfilled. Besides Hale, another Yugoslavian superstar, Gugucevic, may also accompany Ponséck on this trip, which is also unknown. According to Mr. Spike's statement yesterday, it can be decided that Sanchez and Anson will repeat their previous performance in Shanghai. If the Coolidge can berth as scheduled, the exhibition match will be held on the afternoon of the 7th. If the voyage is delayed until the afternoon or evening, the exhibition match will inevitably be postponed to the 8th. Sanchez and others have achieved considerable results in the United States recently. Anson once used the "Toffee" strategy to contain Wimbledon champion and American number one player Riggs. On the same day, the "Flying Eagle" team, the runner-up in the South Seas Military and "Le" groups, will also play the semi-finals to compete for the runner-up final. The loser will be fourth, and the winner will compete with the loser of the "Xianle" and "Xufang" teams (i.e., the eliminated team in the overall championship) for the runner-up. The team that wins the overall championship will have an exhibition match with the host team "Qianghua" on a scheduled date. The results of the two groups are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hundred Character Group: Le Character Group (Note) Qianghua's results are not counted. The championship belongs to Xianle. Lvpíng, Zhiqiáng, Jiaolián, and Huáfàn all abandoned more than two finals, and their qualifications were revoked according to regulations, and their results were cancelled.</p>
<h3>Shēn Bào Table Tennis Team's Match Report</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shēn Bào table tennis team accepted an invitation from the China Travel Service's (Zhōnglǚ) team for a friendly match at the Zhōnglǚ's gym. More than a hundred people watched. The strength of both sides was even, so the match was exciting and the scores in each game were very close. As a result, the Zhōnglǚ team was slightly better, and the Shēn Bào team was defeated by a score of nine to thirteen.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Two Soccer Giants Meet: Eastern Loses to South China, Guanghua Beats British Navy</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The two giants of Hong Kong's Chinese soccer, South China and Eastern, met on the 22nd of this month (October) at the foot of the Jia Shan. As a result, Eastern failed to avenge their loss from last year, losing two to one. Currently, South China is firmly in first place with three wins in three games. In Kowloon, the Chinese team Guanghua met the foreign sailors at the Police Stadium in Chenshi. Yesterday, Guanghua used a new formation. Li Siliáng, the new coach, was in high spirits and led the central army. Because there were not many British warships staying in Hong Kong, many first-class players had already gone to sea, and the lineup was not well organized. Guanghua took the opportunity, and the five forwards played like ducks to water, with good shooting skills, and finally defeated the Navy with a score of six to four.</p>
<p>Guanghua Team:</p>
<p>Li Guóqí, Li Guówei, Huáng Huájì, Xiè Jǐnhóng, Yáng Zǐxiáng, Zhāng Shùhuī, Huáng Jǐngcōng, Zhuō Shíjīn, Li Siliáng, Liú Fúquán, Tián Róngfā</p>

<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Banks Frequently Sell Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC's listed exchange rates were all flat. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange rates, due to the end of the tenth month, American banks sold British currency to buy American currency, engaging in British-American exchange arbitrage. Hong Kong banks and Jewish merchants also came to sell, so the trend returned to hovering. The process in the first half of the day was still in a loose and weak state. Although the trend was not easy to grasp, it was generally believed that the exchange rate would not undergo drastic changes in the near future. In other words, the range of ups and downs was limited to within five points. At the opening in the morning, British gold was slightly firm at 0.15625, and the American exchange rate was narrower at 0.03125. Later, due to the frequent selling from Hong Kong banks and the lack of appetite from Jewish merchant Qiao Zhífu, the situation became unsustainable and turned loose. British gold once reached a high of five points one two five, and the American exchange rate also reached eight and a half yuan. Later, HSBC took the opportunity to absorb when it saw it was cheap, and the market situation began to recover. As a result, the closing price was five points zero seven eight one two five, and eight yuan four three seven five, which was looser by 0.0625 for the British and cheaper by 0.09375 for the American compared to the previous day. As for the discussion of futures trading for this month, the market situation was inseparable from the spot market. Trading in the first half of the day was still active.</p>
<p>The process of Feng Shang's selling is becoming looser</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large strips for both near and far term narrowed by 0.1875, New York's silver price did not change, and London's raw gold remained stable. The exchange rates for British versus American, Shanghai, and France were all flat, American versus British was up by half a point, versus French was up by large 0.375, and versus Shanghai was down by small 0.045. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were five points for British and eight yuan three one two five for American, which was firmer by 0.015625 for the British and softer by 0.03125 for the American compared to the previous close. After opening, an American bank first came to sell spot British gold at five points to a certain British bank, and the situation continued to soften slightly. When HSBC's listed prices were announced without any movement and the silver equilibrium tax was announced down by small 0.0125, Hong Kong banks suddenly came to sell, and foreign banks' appetite was bland, so the market situation turned firmer. It is estimated that Hong Kong banks sold spot British gold at five points zero three one two five and zero six two five, and spot American exchange rate at eight yuan three seven five to foreign banks such as Unilever and Chase. Later, Hong Kong banks continued to release, and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhífu also came to short sell, so the process became firmer. It is estimated that Hong Kong banks sold spot British gold at five points zero nine three seven five and spot American exchange rate at eight yuan four three seven five to foreign banks again. At the same time, Qiao Zhífu sold British gold for this month at five points zero nine three seven five to Unilever and a certain bank. Later, the firm British gold once reached a high of five points one two five, and the American exchange rate also reached eight and a half yuan. Later, the selling wind gradually subsided, and the appetite of foreign banks such as Chase and Unilever improved, so the situation slightly returned to flat. Until the noon close, the banks' spot selling prices were five points zero seven eight one two five for British, and eight yuan four three seven five for American. The British gold for this month was five points zero four six eight seven five, and the American exchange rate was eight yuan three seven five. As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot British was firmer by 0.0625 and the American was cheaper by 0.09375. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Shanghai exchange rate fluctuated greatly</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 1st telegram, the exchange market opened flat this morning, the British, American and Japanese exchange rates did not move. The spot Shanghai exchange rate dropped by three yuan to 291 yuan. At 9:55 AM, the spot Shanghai exchange rate rebounded by three yuan to 294 yuan. At 10:30 AM, the spot Shanghai exchange rate dropped again by three yuan, still at 291 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the spot Shanghai exchange rate dropped again by four yuan, to 287 yuan. At the noon close, the spot Shanghai exchange rate rebounded by four yuan, to 291 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tianjin's British and American exchange rates narrowed</p>
<p>Tianjin, 1st telegram, the exchange market opened flat this morning, the British and American exchange rates rebounded, the spot British exchange rate narrowed by 0.1875, calling for nine three seven five points, the spot American exchange rate tightened by 0.4375, to eight yuan one two five. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by half a yuan, to 103 yuan. The unofficial market for "United Notes" was slightly cheaper by 0.25 yuan, to 92.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Lifeless: Closing Price at 3,690 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash "cooked red" unofficial market situation, good times did not last long, and fell into a situation where selling arose everywhere. Buyers were dispirited and exceptionally scattered, resulting in a drop of thirty-five yuan in the end. Opening in the morning, continuing the afterglow of the previous night, it rose another fifteen yuan to 3,740 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange reported weakness and was once quite stable, but after 10 o'clock, it suddenly became loose and firm, with the securities firms and gold shops competing to sell the most. Although the silversmiths' firms acted on behalf of Hong Kong banks and local banks, they absorbed a certain amount in one go, but the head office still felt abundant, so it once fell to a low of 3,680 yuan. At noon, the exchange market had already become slightly flat, and the shorts had also made a profit, eagerly thinking about replenishing, so it came out of the 3,700 yuan range. Until the noon close, it was 3,700 yuan. There was no foreign exchange market in the afternoon, and the gold market was deserted. It was initially opened with more scattered releases, hovering until the evening close at 3,690 yuan. There were very few changes in the middle, only 12 yuan of ups and downs. The entire day's trading was active in the morning, but surprisingly clear in the afternoon, totaling around a thousand taels. The silversmiths' jewelry gold did not change throughout the day, and the customs gold and so on remained flat.</p>
<p>Cooked red fell by thirty-five yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), the foreign exchange was slightly softer at the initial opening, and the sentiment was still good. The market opened fifteen yuan higher, and the Qian Dui firm entered thirty taels from the securities firm, for 3,740 yuan. A certain gold shop threw out a small amount, and it immediately fell back by fifteen yuan, and the other shop sold twenty taels to the silversmiths' firm, for 3,725 yuan. At that time, a certain securities firm bought on behalf of customers, and it rose again by fifteen yuan, and the securities firm entered fifty taels from the gold shop, for 3,740 yuan. After this, the foreign exchange suddenly turned firm, and the selling wind called up. The gold shop, the Qian Dui firm, and the securities firm competed to sell, although the silversmiths' firm entered more and released less, the head office still felt abundant, and it immediately fell by forty yuan. At that time, although the Hong Kong bank limited the purchase to 3,700 yuan, the number was not large, and it was difficult to match the continued small twenty yuan. The securities firm sold twenty taels to the Qian Dui firm, for 3,680 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange stabilized slightly, and a certain Qian Dui firm's appetite suddenly improved, so it rebounded by twenty-five yuan. The Qian Dui firm mutually did thirty taels, for 3,705 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange returned to a loose and firm state, and the gold shop and securities firm's selling wind rose again, so it was pressed down to 3,685 yuan again. Near the closing time, the foreign exchange returned to flat, and a certain Yu shop suddenly came to enter again, returning to a high of thirty yuan, and the gold shop mutually did fifty taels, for one two thousand seven hundred fifteen yuan. Later, the silversmiths' firm threw out and slightly weakened again, and the Qian Dui firm spat out twenty taels to the gold shop, for 3,700 yuan as the noon closing price. The state was calm in the afternoon. The initial opening was two yuan higher, and the Qian Dui firm entered twenty taels from the silversmiths' firm, for 3,702 yuan. Later, because the Qian Dui firm and a certain silver shop's bulls spat out, it stepped down by twelve yuan, and a certain silver shop sold a total of thirty taels to the Qian Dui firm and the securities firm, for 3,690 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell thirty-five yuan compared to the previous day, with sixty yuan of ups and downs throughout the day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was ten yuan higher than the cooked red, and the purchase had to be reduced by more than twenty yuan. The current standard gold was about fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry gold still hangs at the original price</p>
<p>Because there were no major ups and downs in cooked red, the price of silver jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged throughout the day. The Dahang firm still hangs at the original price of 375 yuan. The Xinhang firm has the same price as the above, and the purchase is reduced by about fifteen yuan.</p>
<p>Interest on Exchange Transfers in October: 5.5 Yuan per Thousand</p>
<p>The Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee has set the interbank exchange transfer deposit interest rate for October at 5.5 yuan per thousand. Yesterday, it has been notified to all banks for reference.</p>
<p>Discount and Call Interest Rates Are Both Low</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange transfer notes fell sharply again. The discount rate per thousand yuan has fallen to within forty yuan. It was still hovering around 43 yuan in the early morning. The supply of cash was greater than demand, so it fell to forty yuan at noon. The decline continued in the afternoon, and it finally reached thirty-nine yuan, which was a fall of four yuan compared to the previous day. The call interest rate of the Qianye Association continued to drop by 0.02, and both the morning and afternoon markets were listed at 0.15.</p>
<p>British and Indian silver stopped rising and fell</p>
<p>London, 31st telegram, American merchants sold in the silver market, and the shorts replenished slightly. There were few transactions, and the market was flat. After the close, it was flat. The entrants were content. The large strip silver for both near and far terms narrowed by 0.1875. New York silver telegram, the American spot price did not change. Also, Bombay silver telegram, the Indian silver market situation was calm, and the current terms were all small four anna, with only twenty transaction orders.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Debt Soars, Domestic Debt Moderately Good</h3>
<p>In the unofficial market for securities, the market initially showed a slight tendency to weaken due to the emergence of many longs. Then, with the sudden rise of gold and the knowledge that foreign public bonds were trending upwards, the selling pressure suddenly decreased, and the market immediately turned better. The rising trend was also stable in the afternoon. The environmental news was dull, so the trend almost relied on the ups and downs of foreign exchange and gold. Although the rumors of negotiations between the United States and Japan were very prevalent, they were still under brewing. This matter has a great relationship with the rise and fall of our country and public bonds, so the trend of public bonds may temporarily hover because of this. Trading was worse than yesterday, only the longs were more numerous, so it was said that the bulls were in the majority. The market sentiment was quite powerful under this influence. As soon as the major investors moved, the market price would rise accordingly. The initial opening was stable in the morning, and it fell slightly. Later, Lianhe and No. 20 absorbed more, and the market price was raised immediately. The trend was the same in the afternoon. Type C broke through the nine yuan mark again, and No. 20 and Lianhe and others had an appetite again, so the market price was firm. As a result, it rebounded by 0.2 to 0.55 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transaction, 50 shares of Zhejiang Industrial Bank stock were transacted, and the price was 62.5 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 31st telegram, the listed market price of British Far East companies' stocks today had very slight ups and downs. The unregistered shares of Kailan Mining continued to rise by 0.06, and the price was -6 shillings. The London registered shares of HSBC Bank fell back by one pound, and the price was 77 pounds. Gulak-Klim Rubber shares fell by 0.07, to sixteen shillings three pence, and the rest were flat.</p>
<p>London, 11th telegram, the listed market price of Chinese foreign debt today was consistently firm and rising. The upper-end quotations rose well from one pound to five pounds, and the lower end also rose one or two pounds. Among the upper ends, the French American gold (with seal) soared by five pounds, to 35 pounds. The British French (British issue) and Rehabilitation (British issue) each rose by three pounds, the former to 33 pounds, and the latter to 29 pounds. Crisp rose by 2.5 pounds, to 20 pounds. The British German continuation (British issue) and Fix each rose by two pounds, the former to 42 pounds, and the latter to 8 pounds. Among the lower end, the railway public debt rose by two pounds, which were Daoqing and Tianjin-Pukou. The new price of Daoqing was 12 pounds, and the Tianjin-Pukou (originally continued issue and British issue German issue) was 11 pounds. The rest rose by one pound, Lake-Guang (non-German issue and German issue) and Jing-Hu were all 12 pounds, Long-Hai and Guang-Jiu were all 10 pounds, and Bei-Ning did not move.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Does Not Have Much Rising Power</h3>
<p>The yarn market has been tired and depressed for several days. Although there is no large demand from the southwest recently, sporadic transactions are gradually showing signs of activity, so people's minds have become stable again. It is a pity that the intake is not smooth, so the rising power is very weak. At the same time, the British exchange rate is also at the 5-point level, going in and out, and the market is becoming more and more silent. Judging from the current situation, a major rise is difficult to find temporarily. However, a drastic fall is unlikely to occur, because although the trend of raw cotton is tired and depressed, the extent of the decline is roundabout and far less than that of yarn, so in terms of the situation, the yarn market may have a period of hesitation.</p>
<p>At the initial opening in the morning, due to the shortening of the draft after noon the previous day, people's minds were restored, and the buyers were particularly strong. The momentum was boosted, and the opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 660 yuan, which was up by 15 yuan. At this time, although there were transactions among peers, the customer helpers did not eat the high price, and it fell back twelve yuan in an instant, falling to 648 yuan. The original reason was that the draft was lengthened again, and it gradually rose back a few yuan later, at 653, 4, 5 yuan, up and down. It was found that 1,240 bales were transacted in half a day, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse rose 19 yuan, and the market price of Tiannv rose 18 yuan. The factory opened 125 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng from the Yong'an factory, at a price of 655 yuan. The Chongxin factory opened 150 bales of 12-count Dafā, at a price of 615 yuan. Today, 570 pieces of cotton yarn are transported to Ningbo. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Cotton Sales Show a Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>Due to the significant activity of cotton yarn factories yesterday, both the inner and outer Dakang factories had needs, but the amount was not large, and the market situation was still calm. In addition, the yarn market was floating and uncertain, and the factory's thoughts were indifferent, so the market price was not much different from the previous day. The source of northern Jiangsu has been slightly reduced. Only 345 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived on the wharf, and 1,860 bales came from the north. The current sales of cotton are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Another message, the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet these days. The lengthening of the exchange rate has made all industries stagnate, and Japanese manufacturers have no appetite at all. Only a certain peer is searching for one or two hundred pieces of West India in the market, and it is said that it is to offset the quota. There are also peers who intend to order American cotton, but they are deeply afraid of the re-lengthening of the exchange rate, so they will order American gold ingots to reduce the risk.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, the market price was still firm in the early morning due to the more active transactions of peers. Overseas telegrams came to purchase, so the cotton price rose slightly. Later, due to the selling of a part of the reactionary and the profit-taking of the bulls, the market situation turned tired. As a result, the closing price fell 5 to 7 pounds sound compared to the previous day. India, including the forecast, rose 25 ropis, Egypt fell more than 10 pounds sound, and Liverpool was flat.</p>
<h3>Grains: Anxian Is Tight, Dugeng Is Still Flat</h3>
<p>Dugeng: The rice market was stable after the noon market turned firm after falling back during the day. Only 14 or 15 cars of goods from Su, Jia, Feng, Qing and other places arrived, totaling more than 2,000 bags. Locals were active at bargain prices, and the inland gangs absorbed the Jiangbei Dujian, so the situation in the Jian market was once tight. However, the general locals insisted on the principle of not buying unless it was cheap, and they did not relax on the consumption. Therefore, although the sales market in the city was smoother than the previous day, the cellar seeds and green seeds on the market were oversupplied, showing a tired state and depreciating by about half a yuan. The remaining goods did not rise or fall. The statistics show that more than 7,000 bags of Changxi special-grade japonica rice and broken japonica rice, Su Tongchang Kun high-grade japonica rice, Qingjiao green seeds, kiln-grown wild rice, Sōngjiāng Hundred Brother six varieties, and new and old Yuan were traded.</p>
<p>Kexian: After falling loose the previous day, the buying interest in yesterday's market was active again. The local and rural locals had strong needs, and the inland gangs and hoarders were particularly active. Moreover, the saying that accumulating grain to prepare for famine has been very popular recently, and the large hoarders are trying to absorb it quickly. Therefore, when there was congestion at the head yesterday, the morning market saw an upward trend. According to yesterday's arrival of Nanjing Xian in 13 cars, Jianglun had a whole batch arriving, totaling more than 10,000 bags. Among them, 8,000 bags of new arrivals in the firm were not worth the cost due to the large donations, so they did not press out samples. The Japanese merchants only sold small batches, and it was rumored in the market that the new arrival cars and those shipped from Jiangbei had encountered unexpected obstacles. Therefore, the selling price of Kexian once rose by three or four jiao, and then some floating groups sold, and it only fell flat in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Wheat Is Difficult to Overrise, Flour Remains Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>The flour market remained firm and stable. Due to the high price of raw materials, the factories were still firm on the selling intention for large gang go-downs. The retail transactions in this street were only for daily needs. The unified city transactions were more than 30,000 bags, including the Green Battleship brand at 7.4 yuan, and the Red and Blue Car and Green Cannon Car at 7.5 yuan. The returned goods in the market were very dry, and the sellers were very eager, so the market price increased by several points to one jiao.</p>
<p>There are not many sources of wheat, and the inventory in the market has always been held by hoarders, and they cannot be fully supplied. However, the factories are also unwilling to make further advances for high-priced raw materials, so the market is difficult to overrise. The Tongshi Jin bought 600 bags from the Fuxin factory, and the hoarders traded 7 cars, and the price was the same as the previous market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: New Dalian Yellow Soybeans Have Been Thrown Open</h3>
<p>The yellow soybean market yesterday, because new soybeans in Dalian have been thrown open, and it is expected that they can arrive in three or four days, people's minds have stabilized, and transactions have also been light. The unified market accounted for 4 cars of Dalian beans to be delivered in three or four days, at a price of 16.5 yuan, 300 bags of Taicang beans, at 14.5 yuan to 14.4 yuan, 150 bags of Wuhu beans, at 14.1 yuan to 0.2 yuan, 80 bags of Nanjing beans, at 14 yuan, 10 bags of Chongming sand yellow, at 14.2 yuan and 14 yuan, 30 bags of Pudong du beans, at 16.2 yuan, 20 bags of Pinghu beans, at 15.9 yuan. Also, yesterday there were 179 bags of beans transported from Beisha.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Huizhou White Sugar Transactions Are More Active</h3>
<p>The foreign sugar market was slightly tighter yesterday. According to a telegram from the Netherlands, raw white has also risen to 11.90 Dutch guilders. The association's allocation of spot 24 raw white rose by half a yuan, 53.5 yuan in this warehouse, and 54 yuan to 54.3 yuan in foreign warehouses. There was no change in the transfer cargo. Taigu car white did not rise or fall much, and the B mark was 58 yuan to 58.5 yuan, and the rest were retired. The H mark car red and Dutch red held their original prices. This cotton white rose by five jiao, No. 1 was 54.5 yuan, No. 2 was 54 yuan, No. 3 was 53.5 yuan, and No. 4 was 53 yuan. This ice did not rise or fall. In the national sugar, Yuantaiheng was the only one who entered thousands of bags of Huizhou white sugar a few days ago, and yesterday it opened another four or five hundred bags, the goods are more common, and the price was 56.3 yuan to 55 yuan, and the decision was 51 yuan. Yesterday, 600 bags of sugar were transported to Ningbo.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: High-Quality Black Fungus Stands Out</h3>
<p>Ordinary black fungus has not risen or fallen much recently, but the high-quality Sichuan ear in Shangzhuang is quite tight. It once opened to 337.8 yuan, and the secondary ear is even more scarce. For example, the large flower surface extracted from Shier ear also needs 380 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals White Iron Sheet Sales Slow</h3>
<p>The white iron sheet trade saw only local construction firms active yesterday. Merchants from other cities felt it was very quiet. It was found that all northern China firms in the city only took dozens of bundles. Local construction firms bought close to a hundred bundles, so the market was still good, and the prices were up by twenty to thirty cents. For example, 3-foot 6-inch sheets sold for $5.70 each, and 3-foot 7-inch sheets sold for $6.70 each.</p>
<h3>Textiles Cotton Cloth Gains Momentum with Lower Prices</h3>
<p>The cloth market has passed the end of the month. Cheap goods from retailers in the market are gradually running out, and factory prices are firm. Local firms are showing signs of reselling to Suzhou. People's confidence is stable, and there is continued buying at lower prices. White cloth and coarse cloth have risen by 10 to 25 cents per piece. Fine cloth and fine twill are stable. Although dyed and bleached fabrics mostly still open at the original prices, the market atmosphere is already tightening. The British company Ewo Factory released 600 bales of 11-pound Three Rabbits, Three Deer, and Three Cats coarse cloth, which were purchased by local firms. Transactions were quite active. A total of over 400 pieces of white cloth, coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill were traded. Over 200 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, flannel, and printed fabric were traded. The Wenzhou-Nanjing firms handled over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, and colored twill. The Fujian firms handled over 3,000 pieces of plain serge and colored twill. The Yunnan firms handled over 2,000 pieces of colored twill, wool gabardine, and blue cloth. Overseas business has become a little quiet. Yesterday, 860 pieces of textiles were shipped to Ningbo.</p>
<p>East cloth and white cloth benefited from the rising yarn market yesterday. Morale inside and outside the industry is improving, and the selling prices are gradually consolidating. Fine cloth firms opened 300 bales, with 12-pound Five Blessings offered at $18 per piece, Trumpet at $17.75, and Yanghe at $18.50. Therefore, the spot market price for fine cloth also increased by 10 to 15 cents per piece. Dragon Head fine cloth was $5.15. Fine twill was generally stable due to weak dyeing sales in the local market.</p>
<h3>Breeches Cloth Coats Still Popular</h3>
<p>Recently, as the weather has turned colder, woolen coats and lined coats are increasingly being custom-made at Western clothing stores in areas like Dashijie. Breeches cloth and "Tosca" wool are still popular this year, so sales of these two items continue to be broad. "Changhua Ewo Yinfeng" breeches cloth is mostly quoted at $10.05, and British-made 1005 is quoted at $18. The "Kongshi" brand has increased by 50 cents. "Tosca" wool sells for $18.50 for Western goods, $15.50 for Ewo, and $11.75 for Yongxing. Clothing stores have increased the prices of various lined coats due to the rising costs of raw materials and all expenses. First-class coats are priced at $90 each, second-class at $70, third-class at $55, and the lowest quality at least $40.</p>
<h3>Coal "Mark White" Coal Drops Ten Dollars</h3>
<p>Since a large batch of Hongji white coal arrived last month, inventories have piled up, and people's confidence is weak, causing the market to decline, resulting in few transactions among firms. However, yesterday, the "Yi Tai Xing" customs prices remained the same because water transportation fees and customs duties have increased, and costs are related, making it difficult to drop prices further. However, one firm offered "Mark White" coal at a reduction of ten dollars per ton, calculated as an internal price among firms. Lump coal was $106, small lump coal was $100, and coal dust was $58. Pick up from the warehouse yourself, and add extra charges from the firm.</p>
<h3>Huangyan Charcoal Sells Well</h3>
<p>Since the closure of the Oujiang River in Wenzhou, shipping has been blocked, and the source has been hindered. Only a few sailboats are carrying charcoal, and the amount is limited, at most two to three hundred piculs. Internal prices are now quoted at $11 per picul, but it is just a drop in the bucket. Most of the stores in this city sell Haimen Huangyan charcoal, stacked like goods, at $7.60 per picul, delivered by firms, with additional carrying fees.

<h3>Road Construction Incident Beyond the Border: Due to New Attack Incident, the Bureau Intensifies Negotiations, British and American Consulates Research Specific Solutions, the Board Meeting Did Not Discuss</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources from Westerners last night, the executives of the Municipal Council, in view of the shooting of a Western constable by the puppet police on Columbia Road on the morning of the 1st, have decided to promptly submit the specific plan drafted for the issue of road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai to the puppet government in order to resolve the disputes in the area as soon as possible. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Specific Plan</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai, the Director General and CEO of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, and the Chief of Police, Mr. Barnes, have drafted a "specific plan" based on the "Proposed Outline" in order to discuss and resolve all disputes recently occurred between the Municipal Council and the puppet "Municipal Government". The plan was drafted at the end of last week, but due to its importance, the "Proposed Outline" was presented by the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, to the puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan on the evening of the 26th of last month. As for the "Specific Plan," it has not yet been sent out.</p>
<p>British and American Research</p>
<p>According to reliable news obtained last night, the Municipal Council is currently preparing multiple copies of the "Specific Plan" and distributing them to five British board members and two American board members for research and to solicit opinions. Outside of the board meeting, consultations will be held, and then the plan will be handed over to Chairman Fessenden to negotiate with the puppet government. The focus of this case rests on the British and Americans, and it is impossible to have the Chinese and Japanese board members publicly discuss it. Therefore, it is understood that the board meeting held at half past two yesterday afternoon, in addition to discussing routine cases, did not involve this issue. This is partly to avoid direct conflicts between the Chinese and Japanese board members, and partly because off-meeting negotiations allow for more room for maneuver.</p>
<p>Focus on Police Power</p>
<p>As for the content of the specific plan, the authorities are currently keeping it strictly confidential. It is said that the five Chinese board members have not been informed in advance. Generally, it is to advocate that the principle of joint management be adopted in the police aspect, just like the Yu-Fessenden plan (Yu Hongjun and Stirling Fessenden). The issue of taxes and fees will not be discussed for the time being and will be negotiated later.</p>
<h3>New Attack Incident</h3>
<p>The issue of road construction beyond the border has not been resolved, and the encroachment of power by the puppet police beyond the border has repeatedly occurred, forming a confrontational situation with the concession police. At 0:05 am yesterday, another incident occurred on Columbia Road near Anhe Temple Road in which puppet police shot at a Western constable of the concession police. Details have been seen in the latest news column of this newspaper yesterday. The details obtained subsequently are described below:</p>
<p>Puppet Police Fired More Than Sixty Shots</p>
<p>The English "North China Daily News" reported that two foreign police officers of the Municipal Council's Police Department were involved in a minor accident with "Avenue Police" while driving a motor vehicle on the night of yesterday (31st). After the situation was resolved by Mr. Hemm and Lu, the two police officers were suddenly surrounded and attacked by other Avenue Police, and one handgun, watch, and electric lamp each were taken away by the Avenue Police. This incident occurred at 0:05 am today (1st) on Columbia Road not far from Anhe Temple Road. The Avenue Police fired more than 60 shots. The two foreign police officers did not retaliate because they could not see where the opponents were hiding.</p>
<p>Watch and Lamp Were Stolen</p>
<p>American residents Mr. Haining Xun and Mr. Glace were driving home when they were caught in the line of fire and were almost hit by bullets fired by the Avenue Police. The Avenue Police and the Central Army sent a large team to the scene to stop the shooting. After a long negotiation, the handgun was returned to the Police Department, but it was missing three bullets, and the watch and electric lamp were stolen by the Avenue Police.</p>
<p>Two Westerners' Cars Were in a Dangerous Situation</p>
<p>When American residents Mr. Hague and Mr. Glace were involved in this incident, their car followed a truck of Avenue Police along Columbia Road. When the police motor vehicle approached the truck from the opposite direction, gunfire suddenly erupted. The two cars had already passed each other, and the Avenue Police on the truck also increased their firing. Mr. Hague and Mr. Glace's car stopped ten feet away from where the two foreign police officers were taking cover. Several bullets whizzed past the car. Mr. Hague and Mr. Glace immediately drove the car back into the driveway of a nearby foreign residence to take temporary shelter.</p>
<p>Puppet Government Attempted to Levy Car Tax</p>
<p>The "North China Herald" reported that "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan recently replied to the Shanghai Consular Body Leader Nello, rejecting Nello's request to peacefully resolve the issue of cars traveling on roads outside the border before issuing a "Special Municipal Government" notice. The letter also stated that from January 1 next year, any cars traveling on roads built beyond the border of the Public Concession must display a "Municipal Government" notice.</p>
<h3>Constant Gunfire in the Western Suburbs: Chinese Army Attacking, Loud Explosions from Qingpu, the Battle is South of Hongqiao Road, Rumors of French Army Destroying Hand Grenades Cannot Be Confirmed</h3>
<p>The English "North China Daily News" reported that residents of the Lujia Road and Kaixuan Road areas heard bombs exploding and sporadic machine-gun fire in southern Shanghai yesterday afternoon (31st) and evening until 9 pm. This is a sign that the guerrillas continue to attack the Japanese army. Residents of Hongqiao also said that they heard machine-gun fire from the south in the afternoon and a very loud explosion from the Qingpu area on the road west of the airfield around 6 am.</p>
<p>Loud Explosions from Qingpu</p>
<p>The explosions heard by residents yesterday morning were not caused by guerrillas but by the French army destroying hand grenades. This morning's newspapers stated that the explosions heard from 5 am to 10 am yesterday were all from the French army destroying hand grenades. However, the English "North China Daily News" could not confirm that the French army actually got up before 5 am to engage in this work, and the French army would not destroy its hand grenades in Qingpu or south of the French Concession.</p>
<p>One Said Explosions Destroyed Hand Grenades</p>
<p>The "North China Herald" reported that from 5 am to 10 am yesterday (31st), many explosions were heard intermittently in the Xujiahui Village area, causing great commotion among residents in the Western District. It has now been learned that the French authorities considered it unsafe to continue storing hand grenades that had accumulated for more than a year due to the possibility of spontaneous explosions, so they destroyed them. The French authorities notified the Japanese authorities of the planned explosion of a large number of hand grenades on Sunday, and then dug a large pit on the spot, placed the boxed hand grenades in it, and evacuated all residents within 500 meters of the area before detonating the hand grenades one by one. In previous years, the French authorities used to transport dangerous hand grenades to French warships and sink them at sea, but this year it was discovered that this could not be done, so yesterday's method was adopted.</p>
<p>Important Objects Were Hit</p>
<p>Chinese guerrillas in the area east of Qingpu and west of Hongqiao Road have been skirmishing with the Japanese army since the evening of the 30th of last month, and the attacks continued until yesterday. Residents living in the Kaixuan Road area heard intermittent explosions and machine-gun fire until 9 pm the night before. Residents of Hongqiao Road still heard machine-gun fire clearly coming from the south yesterday afternoon. According to residents of Hongqiao Road, a loud explosion was heard from the Qingpu area before 6 am yesterday, and some important objects were hit.</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Forces Panicked and Forcibly Drafted Laborers</p>
<p>Chinese guerrillas in the four suburbs of Shanghai are approaching daily, and all railways and highways have been destroyed, severely impacting the Japanese army's lifeline of transportation. The Japanese army cannot defend against this, and now orders the Avenue Municipal Government to instruct the thirteen "Avenue District Offices" to force local people to organize "Railway Protection Associations" or "Road Protection Associations." "Avenue District Chiefs" and "Avenue Township Chiefs" are taking the opportunity to exploit this, drafting laborers from house to house to protect roads for the Japanese. If a road is destroyed by the Chinese army, the laborers around that road will be severely punished. As a result, young people are forced to flee, and the number of refugees is increasing daily.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Defense Line Has Been Shortened</p>
<p>After the Chinese mobile forces in western Shanghai were thoroughly reorganized by the ×th War Zone Commander, most of them have been replaced by trained regular troops, with the Provincial Security Team as the mainstay. There are effectively two regiments of regular troops, supplemented by local militias. In the past week, the transportation lines from western Shanghai to Qingpu, Baoshan, Jiading, and the towns belonging to Shanghai County have been controlled. The Japanese army has shortened its defense line and concentrated its forces in the Jiangwan barracks and the Datong airfield. The puppet troops are hiding in the areas of the roads built beyond the border. Therefore, the gunfire has subsided slightly at night, and everyone is on edge. Puppet officials in puppet government offices outside the roads built beyond the border in western Shanghai are all in a state of infinite fear. The puppet "Police Sub-bureau" and the puppet "Court," etc., strictly closed the front and rear doors at 2 pm, and all puppet officials left, either living in Hongkou or Yuyuan Road, etc., and only returned the next morning after the Japanese army resumed patrolling.</p>
<p>Streetcar Scrip Limited to Use by Year End, Two Companies Will Announce, Puppet Scrip Numbers Huge</p>
<p>The two concession streetcar companies, due to the lack of fractional currency, issued scrip. Now, as the Central Bank's fractional currency notes have been issued and circulated, the two companies have decided to gradually recover the scrip issued starting today. All issued scrip will be limited to use until December 31, after which it will be void. This will be announced to the public soon. It is also heard that the Public Concession issued scrip because counterfeit scrip was found on the market. The number of scrip recovered and destroyed by the company has reached more than ten thousand yuan, resulting in huge losses.</p>
<h3>Yangtze Air Force Bombs Japanese Warship, Previously Reported as Phoenix Sun, Mistake for Eastern Revival Sun</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Fuliang reported the other day, the Japanese transport ship Phoenix Sun was sunk by the Chinese army while sailing on the Yangtze River near Jiujiang, etc. At the time, the language was unclear, whether it was bombed by the air force or shelled by artillery. The families of the ignorant Chinese workers serving on the Phoenix Sun were especially anxious. According to inquiries, the ship involved was not the Phoenix Sun, (by the way, the Phoenix Sun was previously converted into a transport ship and is now a Yangtze River liner managed by the Japanese East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd.) but the newly built Eastern Revival Sun of the East Asia Company, with a deadweight tonnage of 2,000 tons. It had only been sailing on the Yangtze River for one month when it was attacked by Chinese aircraft. The bombing hit the edge, destroying part of the deck and completely damaging the engine room, making it unable to move but did not sink. It is now docked in the Yangtze River and will be towed to Shanghai for repairs. The Phoenix Sun will also return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>North Jiangxi Road Gap, Inspection Not Relaxed, Japanese Soldiers Constantly Patrolling, Residents Continuously Moving Elsewhere</h3>
<p>In the eastern area of North Jiangxi Road, which is blocked by barbed wire in District A of the north of Suzhou Creek, at the gaps at the junctions of Wenjianshi Road and Haining Road, the Japanese soldiers guarding the posts are still extremely strict in their inspections of residents entering and exiting. Those carrying packages must be ordered to unpack them for inspection before being allowed to pass, regardless of men, women, old, or young. This is undoubtedly related to the current tense situation in the suburbs of Shanghai. Furthermore, within the eastern blockade line of North Jiangxi Road, traffic has been blocked, and Japanese soldiers are constantly patrolling, causing residents to move elsewhere one after another. According to an investigation by a Datong News Agency reporter, there were originally 89 shops in the area, but 33 have now closed down, accounting for approximately 27% of all shops.</p>
<h3>Two Concessions Preparing for Winter Defense, Examining the Strength of Police Officers, Taking Contingency Measures at Any Time</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the British and French concessions, due to the arrival of winter, in order to ensure security and the safety of the lives and property of citizens, the Chairman of the British Concession, Mr. Fessenden, has scheduled to inspect all levels of Chinese, Western, Indian, and Japanese police officers at the Racecourse on the morning of the 5th in order to understand the strength and prepare for winter defense. The French Concession has decided to recruit more than 400 Chinese constables, who are currently being trained in teams every morning and are being sent to various police stations and roads to practice in order to increase police strength. Winter defense will be implemented next month, but the current defense of the concession is extremely tight, and if there are special circumstances, contingency measures can be taken at any time, which is more than sufficient.</p>
<p>Central Ticket Seller Enthusiastically Saving People</p>
<p>The colleagues at the ticket booth of the Central Sports Field on Albert Road in this city are enthusiastic in helping people in need. Since the August 13th Incident, they have been donating funds to charitable organizations every month without interruption. The total amount has reached more than 4,000 yuan. The ticket selling colleagues rely on labor to make a living. Their fundraising method is that each person pays two cents per week, and the total amount of 180 yuan is raised per month. Since the Citizens' Group launched a campaign to solicit donations to support refugees, they have been using this money to support 90 refugees per month. Recently, the Citizens' Group received a gold adoption medal, but because there are too many people, it is difficult to decide who should get it, so they launched a charity sale to raise temporary donations. Whoever contributes the most money will win the honorary medal. Only the colleagues at the ticket booth can participate. Mr. Cai Jinlong has already offered 200 yuan to win this honorary medal, but it is still in the auction. The charity sale donations will still be transferred to the fundraising committee of the Citizens' Group. Their enthusiasm is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>People's Land in Northern Shanghai Forcibly Purchased, Japanese Set Up "Shanghai Constant Property Company" Arbitrarily Valuing and Giving Non-Cashable Bonds</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Constant Property Company," invested and operated by the Japanese, has recently been forcibly requisitioning people's land in the northern Shanghai area in an attempt to build residential houses, prosper the market, and lease it for profit. The area of land being requisitioned everywhere is shockingly large. The real estate properties owned by Chinese landowners in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas after the war will all be lost to the company. If a landowner goes to negotiate after their land is requisitioned because they do not have a pass, it will be confiscated. If they go to file a complaint, the company will arbitrarily value it and only give them a non-cashable bond with the lowest price as payment, requiring the landowner to sign and fingerprint it, with no regrets allowed. The person in charge of this matter is Hirai, the section chief of the Constant Property Company. After their property rights have been infringed upon, all landowners gnash their teeth.</p>

<h3>Japanese Open Fire in Fushan to Prevent Rice from Being Transported to Shanghai, Forty to Fifty Japanese Soldiers Rush to Fushan, Fire Guns to Threaten and Prohibit Rice Ships from Docking</h3>
<p>The "North China Herald" reported that the German-registered river steamer Dalian was docked at Fushan Port on the Yangtze River around noon yesterday (31st). At that time, the boatmen of two rice-laden sailing ships intended to load the rice into the German steamer, but this was stopped by the Japanese army's machine-gun fire, fortunately without injuring anyone. However, the Dalian steamer had to return to Shanghai without carrying this cargo because the sailing ship boatmen were</p>
<p>Threatened by Japanese Guns</p>
<p>and refused to sail back next to the German steamer. The reason for this was that the Japanese army stationed in Hupukou learned the news that rice would be loaded onto the German steamer for transport, so forty to fifty fully armed Japanese soldiers, carrying a machine gun, boarded the Japanese-registered but actually Chinese-owned Xin Jiangnan steamer around 9 am yesterday and ordered it to</p>
<p>Sail to Fushan as Quickly as Possible.</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, when the steamer arrived at Fushan Port, it docked about 1,000 yards away from the Dalian steamer. Without warning, it opened fire from a distance. It is estimated that the Japanese soldiers fired 35 shots, but that was enough to make the sailing ship boatmen stop trying to load cargo into the German steamer and</p>
<p>Paddle Back to Shore.</p>
<p>The Dalian and Xin Jiangnan steamers both arrived in Shanghai last night. The story of the Japanese army opening fire has been confirmed by the crew members of the two steamers. It is also heard that the Japanese army did not board the Dalian steamer but only ordered the captain of the Xin Jiangnan steamer to take them back to Hupukou and then allowed the steamer to leave.</p>
<p>Although the Xin Jiangnan Steamer Was Hit by Several Bullets,</p>
<p>no casualties were reported. As for whether there were any casualties among the people on the sailing ships, it was not confirmed last night. It is learned that the two steamers each weighed</p>
<p>About Eighty Tons.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Japanese intend to prohibit any ships other than Japanese ships from loading and unloading cargo at various ports on the Yangtze River estuary, and unless the requirements of Japanese ships are met first, third-country ships will not be allowed to carry goods and passengers for transport between various ports on the Yangtze River estuary and Shanghai. The Xin Jiangnan steamer sailed from Shanghai to Fushan yesterday morning, and the general cargo it carried was blocked and could not be unloaded onto the sailing ships. As a result, both passengers and cargo were</p>
<p>Forced to Return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is also heard that a team of about 30 Japanese soldiers used machine guns to strafe the rice-laden sailing ships from the Dalian steamer for ten minutes, then took the confiscated rice, 100 bags, and 400 cases of cigarettes back to Hupukou, while the Dalian and Xin Jiangnan steamers were allowed to sail back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Kato to Visit Shanghai Soon, Planned Negotiations with the US and UK, Intended to Supplement the Tokyo Conference, Conducting Timely Discussions</h3>
<p>A special Tokyo dispatch from the "North-China Daily News" on October 31st reports that, according to the "Nichinichi Shimbun," Japanese Special Envoy Kato is about to depart from Tokyo for Shanghai to engage in negotiations with British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, along similar lines to supplement the Tokyo conference. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson told reporters today that the date of Kato's departure for Shanghai has not yet been decided. When Kato arrives in Shanghai, he will naturally hold timely discussions with U.S. and British authorities from time to time, but it is unlikely to be a special negotiation. At the same time, Kato remains in Tokyo to discuss important Sino-Japanese matters, especially the establishment of Wang Jingwei's "New Nanjing Government." Regarding the New Nanjing Government, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson told reporters that although Japan will support the "government," the issue of formal recognition will be a matter for the future.</p>
<h3>Labor Strike Takes a Sharp Turn, Lun Chang Factory to Resume Operations, Japanese Army No Longer Insists on Armed Garrison, Management Agrees to a 30% Wage Increase</h3>
<p>The labor strike at the British-owned Lun Chang factory has lasted for more than five months. Both labor and management have suffered great losses. Although both sides wanted to resume work as soon as possible, it could not be resolved for a time due to behind-the-scenes manipulation. However, the management has continued to work hard to resolve the labor strike, and the more than 2,000 workers in the factory could no longer tolerate it and began to accuse a certain representative of holding up the labor strike. It is now known that the labor strike has taken a sharp turn for the worse. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>No Longer Insisting on Requiring Troops</p>
<p>The main point of contention between labor and management this time was that the management had to allow armed Japanese troops to be stationed in the factory. The management believed that this matter had a great relationship with the management rights of the factory, so it would rather sacrifice business than agree to this condition. Now, the Japanese side knows that the reason is lacking. If they insist on using this condition as a prerequisite for resolving the labor strike, they will be even more opposed by the workers. Therefore, they instructed a certain representative not to mention this condition again. However, the previous condition of increasing wages by 20% has now been changed to a 30% wage increase. It is said that the management has indicated that this condition is acceptable.</p>
<p>Workers Accuse, Agree on a Deadline</p>
<p>According to the factory workers, the dates for receiving subsidies from the Greater People's Assembly are the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month. Every time the workers receive the subsidies, they will ask the representative about the progress of the negotiations. The representative would say that negotiations are underway. Now, all the workers in the factory know that this is all a lie. They already know that in the past few months, although the management has repeatedly decided to seek a reasonable solution, the representative has never negotiated with the management. Therefore, yesterday, when the factory workers went to the Greater People's Assembly to receive subsidies, they accused them. A representative of the Greater People's Assembly, Gu, had no choice but to declare to the workers at the "Dadushi Government" on Dongchang Road that he had indeed negotiated with the management and that a clear response would be obtained on the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Already Repairing, Preparing to Open the Factory</p>
<p>The factory workers only receive a subsidy of 13 yuan per month and cannot maintain their lives. Most of the workers have switched to working in other factories. According to reporters from Da Zhong News Agency, the factory has already started repairing the machinery. All raw materials and goods have been transported into the factory, and it is expected that the factory will be able to resume work soon.</p>
<p>Inland Post Office Messengers Demand Subsidies, Convene Representative Meeting to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>More than two hundred postal workers from thirty-eight inland bureaus affiliated to the Shanghai Postal Administration, including Kunshan, Songjiang, Jiading, Zhoujiaqiao, Qilin Town, Taicang, Chongming, and Nanyang, have requested the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union to ask the Director General of the General Administration, Mr. Chaparin, to approve a monthly living allowance of ten yuan, due to the high cost of living inland, expensive rice and firewood, and huge expenses. The union has agreed to this. Yesterday, representatives Cao Licheng, Zhang Chengfu, and Zhang Zhensheng, etc., together with union representatives Cheng Zuoqing and Wang Kai, visited Mr. Gao Zhicheng, the section chief of the inland business section of the Postal General Administration. In addition to detailing the difficulties of life and rising prices, the representatives requested that the Director General, Mr. Chaparin, be asked to grant the same treatment as the Shanghai Bureau. Mr. Gao expressed sympathy and promised to ask the authorities to handle it. After the representatives were satisfied, they convened a representative meeting at 10:00 a.m. that afternoon on the fourth floor of the General Administration on North Suzhou Road to discuss solutions. The union also sent Cheng Zuoqing and Wang Kai to attend and provide guidance. After discussion, it was decided to wait for the outcome of the negotiations between the section chief of the inland section, Mr. Gao Zhicheng. It is learned that representatives of the postal workers of the inland bureaus are staying in Shanghai, waiting for a satisfactory solution.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Restores Traffic, No Need to Get Off the Train En Route</h3>
<p>Between Nuozhu Station (133 kilometers from Kunming) and Longtan Station (204 kilometers from Kunming, 40 kilometers from Kaiyuan) on the domestic section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the entire line was once blocked due to flooding and damage to the roadbed. After repairs, slow trains have been barely maintained since October 15. However, passengers must get off the train and walk in the damaged sections. As for the Michelin express train, it is still suspended. A telegram was received from Haiphong, stating that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway authorities have now completed repairs to the damaged roadbeds and have decided to resume the operation of the Michelin express train from the 3rd of this month. The date of the train is still twice a week. The night train departs from Hanoi on Tuesdays and Fridays, and connects with the Michelin train to Yunnan in Yongmai the next morning. The entire journey takes only 24 hours. As for the slow train, there is no need to get off the train and walk in the damaged sections.</p>

<h3>Public Outcry, Mitsui Stops Egg Seizure, Foreign Merchants Able to Receive Purchased Eggs, However, Each Basket Must Pay Two Yuan to the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that after the large-scale seizure of eggs by Mitsui &amp; Co. was exposed in the press, the company's highway robbery action has largely stopped, and foreign merchants have been able to receive the eggs they purchased at the mouth of the Yangtze River. This statement has been confirmed at the meeting of the Foreign Merchants' Egg Canning Association this morning (1st). The most important difficulty at present is that the Japanese army charges two yuan in gold for each basket of eggs.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Reorganizes Chongming County Administration</h3>
<p>Local news reports that since Chongming County Town was occupied by the Japanese army, the county administration has been stagnated. It is now heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has appointed Lu as the new county magistrate of the county, ordering him to take office as soon as possible and carry out a major reorganization. As for all the guerrillas in the area of ​​that place and Qihai, the government has already determined a whole method for effectively compiling and training them, so that they can become elite troops. This is because the command could not be unified before, resulting in the dispersion of forces.</p>
<h3>Traces of Master Yuanying</h3>
<p>The Shewen News Agency reports that Master Yuanying, president of the Chinese Buddhist Association, has been detained for twelve days since he was arrested at the Yuanshe Lecture Hall on Daxi Road on the 19th of last month. Although various parties have been trying to rescue him, there is still no news of his release. Recently, it was rumored that Yuanying had been transferred from Jiangwan to Nanjing. It has now been learned that Yuanying is still being held in Shanghai, but is no longer being detained in Jiangwan.</p>
<h3>Detained Crew Released, Polifemo Changes Nationality, Japanese Navy and Army Have Different Opinions Because of This, US Consulate Must Have Serious Protest</h3>
<p>The Panama wheel Polifemo, managed by Norwegian merchant Hualun Foreign Firm, loaded coal in Shanghai on the 26th of last month and berthed at the Xin Mitsui Wharf in Pudong to unload coal. On the morning of the 30th of last month, two Japanese and Korean people suddenly came, accompanied by a team of puppet police, and arrested two Chinese crew members, etc. This matter was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to relevant sources, the two crew members arrested were the second and third mates, so the shipowner attached great importance to it. After the incident, he reported to the US consulate and requested rescue. The Japanese and puppet officials falsely accused the two crew members of anti-Japanese activities, which is completely untrue. Moreover, the third mate (name unknown) also has a British passport and has already become a British citizen. After the second mate, Li Jing, was arrested that morning, he was released and returned to the ship in the evening. The two crew members went to Hualun Foreign Firm to report the next day. The wheel has been transferred from Xin Mitsui Wharf to Hefeng Factory Wharf in Yangshupu on the morning of the 31st of last month. It is also heard that the Panamanian merchant has sold the wheel to a Norwegian merchant, and will enter the dock in Shanghai for repairs within days. According to foreign sources, the Japanese Navy was not informed in advance about the Japanese Army Special Operations Team and the puppet police detaining the two crew members of the Panama wheel. It is believed that this is an act of overstepping its authority and extending its power to the scope of the Navy. As a result, the Japanese Navy was furious about this matter. The US consulate will also have a serious protest.</p>

Although it cannot be said to be as bitter as "hanging one's head and piercing one's thighs" or "collecting fireflies and reflecting snow," the spirit of "diligence" and "learning while struggling" is indeed commendable. Parents will naturally show an inner smile when they see this situation.</p>
<p>Children's learning is progressing day by day, but their physical health is invisibly declining day by day.

<h3>Four Banks Ordered to Handle Foreign Currency Term Savings, Centralizing Overseas Chinese Funds to Store Legitimate Foreign Exchange, Special High Interest Rates Allow Savers to Earn Interest</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that savings are the key to cultivating good virtues in the people and developing economic undertakings, in addition to urging various banks to actively handle savings deposits in accordance with laws and regulations, and allocating their savings to productive undertakings, now promulgates foreign currency term savings deposit measures, designating China, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks to handle them, and the government guarantees them. As for various commercial banks, etc., all those approved by the Ministry may also handle this savings. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture have always accepted and stored foreign currency deposits for overseas Chinese and domestic merchants due to business relations. However, the interest rate was very low. Since the Department of Finance issued the measures, it has followed the foreign currency term savings deposit measures stipulated by the Department. It is also heard that various commercial banks have decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for special approval to handle foreign currency deposits. However, this foreign currency deposit is limited to British, American, French, and other foreign currencies approved by the government, and is converted into foreign currencies for storage in legal currency in order to prepare for future periodic payments and reduce the risk of exchange rate fluctuations at any time. However, the term for foreign currency deposits ranges from two to five years, with interest rates ranging from four to seven percent. The term for deposits converted into legal currency ranges from three to five years, with interest rates ranging from two to three percent. It is said that the aim is to bring overseas Chinese funds back to the country and use these funds to develop economic construction. At the same time, it allows the industrial and commercial circles that use legitimate foreign exchange to store in advance and obtain the interest rate they deserve, and reduces the manipulation of black market foreign exchange speculators, so that the black market foreign exchange can also stabilize.</p>
<h3>Ships from Tianjin to Shanghai Must Undergo Quarantine</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Section Announcement No. 10 states, "There is now a cholera epidemic in Tianjin. All ships coming to Shanghai from that port (including Tanggu and Dagukou) must undergo quarantine in accordance with the measures stipulated in this section's Announcement No. 4 of June 29 this year. All shipping merchants are hereby notified. Port Director Tebeck."</p>
<h3>Strictly Investigate Shanghai-Ningbo Goods</h3>
<p>Recently, the shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo has been frequent, and the goods shipped from Shanghai or exported from Ningbo are extremely crowded. The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Commerce is thinking hard about the methods of dumping goods by the Japanese side, or counterfeiting them, or changing their appearance, or buying national workers' factories to use them. It is extremely difficult to distinguish them. Special cadres have been added to strictly inspect them in various coastal areas, and all chambers of commerce have been notified to pay special attention to them. If suspected Japanese goods are found, the local anti-Japanese and defense teams will review and identify them to prevent them from being mixed in.</p>
<h3>Two Patrolmen are Loyal, Diligent, and Brave, Municipal Council Especially Commends</h3>
<p>At 8:30 p.m. on July 22 this year, a team from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department's Search Team, led by foreign probationary patrolman Zbrowski, was searching pedestrians near Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road when they saw a car passing by. Just as they were about to order it to stop and conduct a search, the passengers in the car suddenly opened fire, and at the same time accelerated and tried to escape. The police officers immediately fired back. The car moved forward a few steps, but was forced to stop due to a flat tire. The armed thugs in the car left the car and fled into a nearby lane. The police officers bravely chased after them. At the time, a patrolling Chinese patrolman No. 708 nearby witnessed the thugs resisting arrest and immediately opened fire on the thugs. As a result, one member of the gang was injured and captured. Two Mauser pistols, fifty-five bullets, and five hand grenades were found in the vicinity of the incident. It was later found that a few minutes before the occurrence of this case, there were twenty political assassins who were hired to attack a newspaper office on Avenue Edward VII. The gang members involved in this case were their accomplices and participated in the incident. The Police Department Special Awards Committee considered that the two patrolmen were loyal, diligent, and brave, and deserved commendation. The Bureau approved the issuance of a Police Special Merit Medal to each of them in order to show encouragement.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Blood Case, A Puppet Official Shot and Killed</h3>
<p>According to visitors from Suzhou, a case of eliminating traitors suddenly occurred again in the city on the morning of the previous day. The victim was named Feng Runsen, who was nearly sixty years old. Before the incident, he had served in the education and political circles and served as the accountant of the county government for many years. After Suzhou fell, he served as the puppet "Section Chief" in the General Affairs Office of the Puppet Maintenance Association. He was then transferred to the puppet "Department of Education" last year, serving as a second-class "clerk." His actual "affairs" were as "Director of the Reception and Dispatch Office." On that day, Feng was taking a chartered car from his residence in Dingxiang Lane to the "Department" to "work." When he was about to reach Pingjiang Road, a strong man suddenly stopped the car and shot him. Feng was shot five times and fell to the ground. The puppet "police" heard the news and sent him to the hospital for treatment. However, because he was hit in the vital parts, he died yesterday. The assassin calmly escaped after the incident. The puppet organization authorities kept the matter strictly secret, and the puppet "newspapers" did not mention a word. Some said that Feng was shot because his adultery was exposed and he was harmed by another lover of his mistress. In fact, this was a trick by the puppet side to stabilize people's hearts. It is heard that Feng's mistress has been detained by the "Special Agency."</p>
<h3>Husband Marries Another, Wife Asks for Alimony</h3>
<p>Li Acui, a woman from Songjiang, is 28 years old. Her parents are both dead. She came to Shanghai to work for a living. At the age of 23, she met Zhu Zhuting from Suzhou and they got married. Later, Zhu lost his job and took Li back to Suzhou to live. At first, they got along well, but soon Zhu came to Shanghai alone to make a living. At first, he sent living expenses to Li every month. Zhu felt lonely living alone in Shanghai, so he married another woman. He regarded Li as a worn-out shoe and ignored her life. Li sued for alimony in the Wuxian Local Court. Unexpectedly, the war broke out, and Li also fled to Shanghai. She had no choice but to live with her husband and his lover, barely making a living. Unexpectedly, Zhu's new love thought it was wrong and often quarreled with her husband, forcing Li to leave. Zhu was bewitched by lust, listened to slander, and often abused Li, and declared that he would choose another match for her. Li could not bear the abuse, so she left alone to avoid relatives' homes. On the one hand, she filed a lawsuit against Zhu Zhuting in the First Special Court, demanding alimony. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu opened a court session to summon her. The defendant did not arrive. Li Chenshu recounted the incident. The court ordered another summons for trial.</p>
<h3>Golden Eagle Radio Station Manager Detained, Stumbled His Son, Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Huang Guoping, manager of the Golden Eagle Radio Station, room 514, Shenzhou Hotel, Zhejiang Road, his son Huang Renchu, is 11 years old. Two months after Renchu was born, his biological mother died of illness. Huang Guoping then remarried a woman surnamed Mou as his stepmother. The stepmother has some discrimination against the son of her ex-wife, and the treatment is naturally slightly different. Renchu's character is also slightly inappropriate. Recently, Renchu stole money and fled to his relatives' home. He was found and sent back to the Golden Eagle Radio Station by his grandfather Huang Xingtang the day before yesterday. Guoping gave him a reprimand. Renchu intended to escape. Guoping stopped him, causing Renchu to stumble to the ground. As a result, he injured his spleen. Huang Guoping's friends Qian and Cheng sent him to various hospitals, but they were rejected because of the serious injury. Finally, he was sent to Renji Hospital. After the hospital's diagnosis, if he did not undergo surgery, his life would not be guaranteed. Even if surgery was used, there was only a 50% chance of success. In order to save Renchu's life, surgery was used. The Laozha Police Station also received a report and sent Chinese Detective Wang Yingjie to investigate, and arrested Huang Guoping. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, saying that it is still difficult to predict whether Renchu's life is in danger, so he requested permission to temporarily detain him so that he could be prosecuted after confirmation. Qian Hongye, the head of the Criminal Court, interrogated Huang Guoping and ordered him to be detained for another trial at a later date.</p>

<h3>Hengren Shipping Company Liquidator Sues Manager for Debt: Wang Yigong and Xu Guansheng Each Hold Their Own Account</h3>
<p>Xu Guansheng, the manager of the now-closed Hengren Shipping Company, was recently sued by Wang Yigong, the assistant manager and liquidator of the company. Wang Yigong, through lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, filed a complaint in the Second Special Court's civil division, alleging debt owed. Presiding Judge Yu Changzi opened a hearing and summoned Xu Guansheng, but the defendant failed to appear, and the hearing was postponed. Yesterday, Judge Yu continued the trial in the Seventh Civil Court. Defendant Xu Guansheng, accompanied by his attorney Zuo De, appeared and awaited questioning. First, Wang Yigong stated the purpose of his lawsuit, saying: "The plaintiff and defendant Xu Guansheng are</p>
<p>Sworn Brothers."</p>
<p>"Last autumn, the defendant opened the Hengren Shipping Company on Hankou Road and hired the plaintiff as assistant manager. Shortly afterward, the company went bankrupt. The defendant then appointed the plaintiff as the company's liquidator, stating that he would provide a monthly allowance of 300 yuan for transportation expenses. At the time, the plaintiff had many affairs to manage, but because he and the defendant were brothers, he could not refuse. The plaintiff liquidated the Hengren Shipping Company for the defendant, and by the time it recently closed, he had advanced over 9,700 yuan, most of which is supported by receipts. In January of this year, the defendant also borrowed 18,000 yuan in cash from the plaintiff. The plaintiff has sent letters to the defendant demanding repayment of the aforementioned advances and loans, but the defendant has</p>
<p>Ignored Them."</p>
<p>"The plaintiff had no choice but to file this lawsuit." The court then questioned the defendant. Xu Guansheng testified that he had not borrowed any money from Wang Yigong, and that the seal on the IOU presented by Wang was not his. Regarding the advances, Xu stated that the bills presented by the plaintiff were also not entirely truthful. When Wang Yigong requested the court to question the defendant about the dozens of supporting documents for the advances, the defendant remained evasive. At this point, the court deemed further investigation necessary and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>Cao Asan, a refugee from Changshu, is nearly fifty years old and lives in the back parlor of No. 6 Shudeli, Xiaohuayuan, Sanma Road. He has only one daughter named Baobao, who is seven years old. She unfortunately went missing on the 24th of last month and has not been found despite a thorough search. Because the child lives with many people from Yangzhou, her accent is slightly Yangzhou. She has a square white face and is about three feet tall. She was wearing a red plaid padded jacket made of foreign yarn cloth, with a health shirt underneath, broken Manten pants made of towel cloth, and towel cloth tire-soled shoes. If any kind person finds her and sends her back, a small reward for transportation expenses will be given, and gratitude will be unforgotten.

<h3>Language and Popular Literature</h3>
<p>— Wen Ge</p>
<p>The complexity of Chinese dialects and the large number of illiterate people in our country are undeniable facts. The reasons for these phenomena are the obstruction of the custom of being attached to one's homeland and the result of metaphysical education. Although there are naturally other important reasons besides these, these seem more important to the problem itself. If we eliminate these two obstacles, we will be unable to correct the abnormally developed morbid phenomena. Therefore, many people understand the importance of this point and have launched a popular literature movement to use its power to penetrate into a realm without obstacles or barriers, so that our knowledge and spirit can thoroughly interact with each other. This is a task worthy of attention, and every literary and art worker should undertake it without hesitation.</p>
<p>However, if there are only efforts in the field of popular literature, there is still a problem, because its scope is only to approach the masses who know a few words. It is still unable to approach the wider masses who are illiterate. Therefore, many people realize that this shortcoming is also important, and they have promoted the new writing movement to unify language and writing and improve the knowledge level of the people. This is also a task that we cannot hesitate about at present, and no one can underestimate it.</p>
<p>These two movements are actually unified, but only differ in direction. Their essence lies in breaking through the barriers of dialects and the obstacles of illiteracy. We cannot only care about popular literature and ignore the improvement of writing, nor can we only care about the improvement of writing and ignore popular literature. Both sides must be taken into account. In this way, can we thoroughly unify spoken and written language, and can we truly make the whole country without barriers!</p>
<p>The language exhibition will open soon. This is considered my dedication. I understand that this exhibition is necessary for us, because it is the best way to let the public understand the content of popular literature and the new writing movement first.</p>
<p>Well then, let's work hard!</p>
<h3>Water Carriers in Beiping City</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shunzhang</p>
<p>In the dim Beiping city, the sound of the night watchman's clapper and some wild birds flying over several courtyards with their dark branches, at the same time, the sound of creaking water wheels rises at the bottom of the alley.</p>
<p>Closer, those water carriers, their clothes stained with oil and tattered beyond repair, barefoot with swollen feet in the cold weather, pull heavy water tanks as they come. They sway dangerously, lift their cramped legs, and stagger along the road in trembling steps, splashing some water... Finally, the rotation of the wheels speeds up, sending their shadows out of this street, far away, until the mournful sound of the wheels stops, and Beiping City is immersed in the morning light.</p>
<p>The prayer bells of the Roman-style church have just rung, and in the hustle and bustle of women with bright hair carrying vegetable baskets going to the market, you can still hear their voices.</p>
<p>"Sir, have you had breakfast yet?" A water carrier with a thin noodle in his mouth and a rope looped over one shoulder, squeezed in the middle, raised his head and shouted when he saw me.</p>
<p>"Oh, I've eaten. Is the river water frozen?" I replied to them in admiration as I watched them carry the pipes. They also mischievously squinted their eyes and gave me a few pleasant gestures...</p>
<p>The water carriers in Beiping City live a very hard life all year round, especially in the winter. In the alleys that are like incense burners, where ice doesn't melt and sunlight doesn't reach, there is no fire burning in their houses. When it snows, they have to rely on these few jackets to walk the long road.</p>
<p>Being a water carrier is not necessarily a lowly profession. There are fathers and sons working together, brothers working together, and sometimes even women with disheveled hair helping their husbands "make a living." Most of them are people who have been displaced from the Songhua River to the turbulent Bohai Bay, and then manage to find work. So, when they are idle, they often chat candidly about what you want to ask, sharing their misfortunes with you.——</p>
<p>Walking into the dilapidated and dilapidated remaining houses, the first thing that catches your attention is a few straw hats hanging on the wall and a few untidy straw clothes. Stepping into the courtyard, they are all there, peeling tasteless dried braised beans, sitting by the well and leisurely making plans.</p>
<p>I have been to such places the most, and I simply say that I like to approach them the most. They are not very rude. When they meet outsiders, they do not deliberately lower their status to speak. They can share some of what they have in their hands with you, surround you in the middle, and tell you the most sincere words in detail.——</p>
<p>"Sir, flowing from the sandy plains to here, although not without any joy, if we were to live in tall buildings and big houses, we would still feel like we had lost something. We are people without a home, but we have never stopped thinking about going home. When our blue veins are bulging, when our noses are running, when we are sweating in the winter:—we are all full of longing."</p>
<p>"Sir, it's really too hard: when you are still in sweet dreams, we have to draw water; when you are eating warm porridge, we are still pulling the cart, until the gates of the Forbidden City in Beiping open: then we drag our tired bodies back to eat hard things. Sir: Which of us brothers doesn't shed tears on that night? We often think like this: when the tide under the Lugou Bridge splashes, we think of the high tide of the Songhua River.……"</p>
<p>Indeed, according to what the gentlemen leaning on the arched counters said, their situation when they came was hard enough. Many of them came when they were very young, and now they are pulling the cart for their fathers. The fathers are still deceiving these children like that: "Children, if you pull the water cart all over the city, you will meet your mother." However, the adults send them out the door with tears in their eyes. Who doesn't worry about the sadness of the children's disappointment afterwards?</p>
<p>Ah, the ancient city of Beiping is full of shrinking, dispirited breath. They rarely see the emblem of the country, they rarely see the plows in the fields, they rarely see the conch shells, but once they see it in a dream-like way, they will never take back the shout that disturbs the quiet air in the mansions of the county officials: "We water carriers have fought for these——go back."……</p>
<p>The evening mist envelops the towering "copper frame," which is "Beiping City," ah——no, I have often seen a few green sparks erupting on the aerial tram lines.——It has been many years since I left Beiping!</p>
<p>May the water carriers achieve their grand aspirations. They have already rushed to one end of the river back to their hometowns. May the mornings in Beiping City no longer have the heavy sound of water tank carts, but instead intensify the north wind, teaching the yellow-robed gentlemen in the city to personally carry water buckets to shake the windlasses——</p>
<p>Finally, the lives of those resolute water carriers should be a brand new leap forward.</p>
<h3>Visitors</h3>
<p>— Jinzi</p>
<p>Last night, close to dawn, I had a dream.</p>
<p>It was an autumn morning. I was walking slowly by the small river in my hometown, and there seemed to be a thin layer of morning mist in the sky. Dewdrops sprinkled coolness on the leaves of the evergreen trees. There was no sound around, and the river flowed silently. The lightness and tranquility made me fall into deep thought.</p>
<p>This contemplation, when I woke up, stirred up so many nostalgic ideas!</p>
<p>If I were in my hometown, the chrysanthemums would have bloomed early!</p>
<p>What kind of season is this————</p>
<p>I went to the lake alone, drifting on a small boat, letting it pass freely through the long willow branches, parked under the white stone arch bridge. There was a pressing coolness in the heart of the lake. Turning back, I stepped into Green Willow Village again and went to the bamboo forest to watch the chrysanthemum festival. Under the thatched eaves, there were large characters made of chrysanthemums. The house was full of chrysanthemums, competing for beauty and blooming with different and gorgeous flowers.</p>
<p>I found a secluded place to sit down and rest for a while. Dusk quickly poured down, and the early cool weather was not cold. The evening wind brushed the autumn mood into my lap from the forest.</p>
<p>Or, I went to the earth hill with a few children, bending down to pick the daisies by the roadside; I came back and inserted them in a gallbladder bottle. The pink-purple petals were like delicate little faces, shyly hiding in the green leaves, as if with infinite tenderness, secretly revealing themselves to people.</p>
<p>In the evening, the desk lamp shone a light blue light, making it look even more like the stars in the night sky at the end of July, dozing in the corner.</p>
<p>When I think of these scenes now, they only add to the misery of the guest window. My home has been shattered into only a pile of rubble, and the fields have long been bombed into scorched earth. As for the chrysanthemums, I seem to see them being cut into pieces under the shining bayonets, like dismembered corpses, scattering petal by petal on the ground.</p>
<p>How the people in foreign lands yearn for its northern fields day and night! But the days of wandering are endless, and life is like a red-hot iron whip just drawn from the furnace——</p>
<p>In Jiangnan, where else can one find autumn except on the thin clothes of the wanderer?</p>
<p>But this is not worth hating!</p>
<p>'Death is not the end.' At this time next year, the seeds of the chrysanthemums will sprout again from the soil, braving the cold dew and the severe frost.</p>
<p>Yes, what is there to be nostalgic about in Jiangnan! I should go back, from that small river, from the lake, from the earth hill, from the vast rice fields, to visit the news of the newborn chrysanthemums.</p>
<h3>News from the Cultural World</h3>
<p>— Pi Ling</p>
<p>The "Chinese Cultural Advancement Association," initiated by cultural figures in Hong Kong such as Jian Youwen, Ye Qianyu, and Ouyang Yuqian, was officially established in Hong Kong on "September 18th." Representatives from all walks of life, including Ye Qiuyuan (literature and art), Ye Gongchuo (academics), Zhong Luzhai (education), Jin Chengfu (journalism), Gao Jianfu (painting), Luo Mingyou (film), Hu Chunbing (drama), Huang Ding (cartoons), and Wu Bojiu (music), totaling seventy or eighty people, attended. After approving the association's charter on the spot, they immediately elected the first board of directors, consisting of twenty-seven people, including Ma Shizeng, Ye Gongchuo, Xu Dishan, and Xue Juexian, and assigned them tasks to develop the association's affairs. (Su Gong)</p>
<h3>Torrent</h3>
<p>— Yu Doucun</p>
<p>I wish I were a rushing torrent, never ceasing.</p>
<p>There is no need to inquire about my source. Even if I am a small raindrop like dust, I have a great ambition: to keep sprinkling, moisturizing the haggardness of the earth with crystal clarity, irrigating the dryness of the barren soil. In this way, I can move my partners, unite my comrades, and converge into a vast clear stream.</p>
<p>If anyone asks why I want to flow, I will say: life symbolizes a long road, and the era is like a revolving wheel. If you don't rush forward, you won't catch up with the journey of life. A great era does not allow stillness, even though there are green grass, red flowers, weeping willows, and dark willows on both sides of the riverbank. You cannot leisurely stay for a moment and greedily admire them. Whoever is greedy will not catch up and fall behind!</p>
<p>There is no need to inquire about the scope of my rushing. Wherever there is darkness in the universe, that is the realm of rushing. I will flow, perhaps flowing through the rolling Yellow River, Yangtze River, Pearl River, and even the Yalu River, washing away all the violent and bestial acts on the riverbank. I will disperse the oppressive shadows of suffering compatriots and light the lamp of the heart.</p>
<p>If anyone asks why I want to rush so loudly and fiercely, I will tell him: I am exerting the power of my talent, stirring up countless waves, like ten thousand horses galloping, military horns blowing, and war drums thundering, extinguishing the sighs and moans of the weak, and arousing the fighting spirit of the warriors. I flow, fiercely, past the simple village and through the beautiful hillside, unceasingly, I drum up the waves.</p>
<p>My journey is very long and vast.</p>
<p>Life is tense, and the times are great. Neither allows me not to flow, nor allows me to flow quietly.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am a torrent, leaping forward.</p>

<h3>The Entertainment World: Rotary Club Sponsors Movie to Collect Toys for Impoverished Children</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>——The movie will be screened in major theaters in rotation before Christmas——</p>
<p>Before Christmas, Shanghai usually has various organizations launching movies to collect toys for impoverished children. In Shanghai, especially after the war, there are countless impoverished children who have not enjoyed entertainment all year round. Therefore, in order to allow these impoverished children to have fun during the Christmas season, organizations such as the YMCA and the Rotary Club usually launch movies to collect toys for impoverished children before Christmas. Currently, with little time left until Christmas and the New Year, the movie sponsored by the Rotary Club to collect toys for impoverished children has already begun to be screened in major theaters in rotation.</p>
<p>The movies to collect toys for impoverished children are screened every Sunday morning, in rotation at major theaters. People who go to see the movie do not have to spend money to buy tickets, but each person can bring a new or used toy to exchange for a ticket. This year's movie sponsored by the Rotary Club to collect toys for impoverished children was screened for the first time last Sunday, October 22, at 10:30 AM, at the Nanjing Grand Theater. Because this type of movie is aimed at children, the movies screened are also limited to children's movies. A considerable number of children attended, and more than 5,000 new and used toys were collected.</p>
<p>The second screening is scheduled for November 5, which is this Sunday morning at 10:30 AM, at the Great Shanghai Theater. According to the original plan, all the films screened will cater to the tastes of children, and will be as exciting as the previous screening at the Nanjing Theater. The Shanghai offices of various Hollywood film companies have expressed their support for this good deed and have unconditionally lent films to the Rotary Club for screening. After collecting the toys, the Rotary Club will repair the used ones one by one, in addition to the new ones, in preparation for distributing them to impoverished children during the Christmas season. I hope that the children who like to watch movies will bring toys and exchange them for tickets to visit. Especially old toys that are useless at home, bring them to see the movie yourself, and the impoverished children can get toys to play with. What a win-win situation! Don't miss this opportunity!</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Watching a Play at the Carlton</h3>
<p>— Shiwuxuan</p>
<p>The Carlton recently revived an old play. I went to see it on Thursday night, and by 7 o'clock, it was packed. While other theaters are competing with low prices, the Carlton can still hold its own, which proves the drawing power of Xin Fang should not be underestimated. Therefore, what I want to discuss is limited to Xin Fang. In the first part of "Song Jiang, Tenth Return," it was performed by Bai Sui and Su Wen together, and then by Xin Fang and Xi Chun. Song Jiang met Liu Tang on the road, acting hesitant and aloof, portraying the ambiguity between acquaintance and unfamiliarity vividly. The running scene in the tavern and the climbing of the stairs were urgent and tight, done in one breath, which can be said to embody the scene at the time and is a masterpiece. Waking up in the inn, with eyes half-open and half-closed, glancing at the morning light through the window, showing the unwillingness to face the dawn, was extremely wonderful. The scene of returning to the inn, checking the pouch, and killing the daughter-in-law was neither rash nor chaotic, just right. However, after the killing, holding the bloody knife, he seemed dazed and crazy, grabbing at the air with both hands for more than ten minutes, which seemed excessive. This is because Song Jiang was not an incompetent person, and he already had the motive to kill the daughter-in-law the night before. Although the killing was forced, after the killing, he should have first checked for the whereabouts of the letter. When going downstairs, he also said, "It's good to do things and take responsibility alone." This shows that Song Jiang was a good man, not a reckless fool without any ideas. Even if he was emotionally moved and mentally flustered, he would not be so extreme. Therefore, in my opinion, this scene's expression was a bit too much. In general, actors should understand the role's identity and represent the role's actions, so that the audience can take the false as real and forget that it is a play. If they are too serious and the actions are unrealistic, it will make the false even more false, and one can tell at a glance that it is a play. Xin Fang's performance is unique in the north and south. Taking this play as an example, actions like shrugging, shrinking the neck, and rolling the eyes are more pronounced than before, which I fear will lead to the fault of being excessive. I wonder if Xin Fang agrees? Recently, Mr. Xu discussed the issue of money, and Xin Fang and Xu Chun both said that a tael of gold would suffice as an answer. "Chopping the Scripture Hall" and "Chasing Han Xin" are both Xin Fang's signature pieces, flawless from beginning to end. Being able to sell out that night was, in no small part, due to the drawing power of these plays. Since hearing about Xin Fang's founding of the Yifeng Society, I have been expecting Xin Fang to reform drama with his unique expressive talent, combined with precise arrangement and directing, and his future achievements are limitless. The so-called Shanghai-style opera, it should be known, is not a traitor to the old drama. Adapting to the times, it can indeed be a unique color in the Chinese theater world. Xin Fang bears the name of "Yifeng" (Changing Customs), and should live up to the reality of "Yifeng". "Jiao Ben Su Chen" will soon meet the Shanghai audience. I sincerely hope that the playwrights pay attention to the word "Yifeng", rather than using publicity slogans like "Undressing and Praying to Fire in an Ancient Temple for Two Birds Sharing a Nest." Although these words can attract audiences, Yifeng Society is different from the Shanghai style of other theaters. I love Yifeng Society, and I love Xin Fang even more, so I offer my humble opinion, hoping it is worth listening to.</p>
<h3>A Record of Listening to Songs at the Xinguang Theater</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changqiu</p>
<p>Zhao Jinrong, the new actress in the second installment at Xinguang, has been performing since taking over from Wu Suqiu, and it has been a score of days now. Yesterday (the 28th), I watched her final performance of "The Mandarin Duck Tomb," and I am writing this record specifically.</p>
<p>I took my seat at eight o'clock, and Ma Xiurong's "Mu Kezhai" was already nearing its end.</p>
<p>"The Great Water Curtain Cave" was staged at 8:10. Although Liang Xuanchao is young, his martial arts skills are solid. When the fighting began, the golden light shimmered, dazzling the audience.</p>
<p>The highlight was Chen Shaolin's "Riot in the Mansion and Emerging from the Trunk." Shaolin's singing this time was more rounded and mellow than in the previous installment (when Wu Suqiu performed). The rhyme was pure, and the phrasing was natural. It was indeed a fine performance in the style of Yu. However, his vocal range is still lacking in width, which is his shortcoming.</p>
<p>The finale, "The Mandarin Duck Tomb," began at ten o'clock. Jinrong, succeeding Wang Fengche, looked very much like Yanqiu, with a dignified and graceful appearance. Her expression was not suited to frivolity, but excelled at tragic beauty. Her melancholy and sorrow, with a frown locked between her eyebrows, made people feel pity for her. However, her figure is rather plump, so her stage presence is naturally not as pleasing. Her singing style had the strength and sweetness of Lanfang, as well as the ups and downs of Yanqiu, melting the styles of Mei and Cheng into one, which is truly remarkable. In the final segment of "Fan Er Huang," every line imitated Cheng's style. This play was taught to her by her teacher, Yanqiu. Assisted by Zhou Weijun as Xie Zhaolang, who was refined and elegant with a clear and crisp voice, he was truly no less than Ye Shenglan. Zhang Chunyan's Yang Zixu was also steady and practiced.</p>
<p>This tragic and beautiful new play, though exquisite and tight, in the first act, where Wang Fengche fell ill due to longing for Xie Zhaolang, and her sister-in-law, Wu, asked Zhang, the Taoist priest to write a letter to be sent to Xie's mansion, the dialogue between the Taoist priest and Wu was overly verbose. In my humble opinion, it should be slightly revised, otherwise, the brilliance of the whole play will be diminished.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Paradise of Music</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Case of Filicide and the Bizarre Case of Patricide</p>
<p>If we were to compare the relationship between teachers and students in the past with the present, they would not be comparable. The accuser in the patricide case was the daughter of the deceased. It is said that dragons have nine offspring, each different. She saw that her father's death was too tragic, and her own ability was weak, unable to stop the brutal actions of her two brothers, so she resolutely reported to the police to capture Qin Ji and Qin Xiang. But in doing so, her Zhou family has been cut off. Her father is dead, and both sons will face the ultimate penalty, while her mother also has her deserved punishment. Originally, a good family ended up in such a tragic scene, with only her, a weak girl, left unscathed. Filial sons can certainly be killed, but Zhou Yongjie was also mean and ungrateful, and his temperament was violent. This is also a case of planting bad seeds and reaping bad fruit. All those who become wealthy through unjust means or fail to educate their children properly should take this as a warning. The theory of karmic retribution may not be entirely believable, but it should not be completely disbelieved either.</p>
<p>If such a case of violating ethics had occurred in the old feudal era, not only would the local officials have been punished, but even the neighbors would have been held guilty. For Qin Ji and Qin Xiang, who are intellectuals and have received considerable education, their teachers would probably also be severely punished. Now, times are different, and of course, the crime only extends to the perpetrators themselves. However, in my opinion, such an inhumane and unprecedentedly heinous crime should not be adapted into a play and performed in public, because even a three-year-old child knows that such acts are wrong. It seems unnecessary to use the power of drama to edify the world. If it is made public, it would only feel too cruel, making viewers unable to bear to witness it. The minds of the Shanghai people are too quick. A certain theater has already adapted this event into a play and will stage it soon. In my personal opinion, I dare not go to see it. (131)</p>
<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Edited by Bao Zibo, Proofread by Lu Chengzu</p>
<p>The Method of "Double Horses Drinking at the Spring"</p>
<p>Variation 1</p>
<p>Horse 8 Retreats to 6, Pawn 6 Advances 1, General 5 Moves to 4, Horse 9 Advances to 7, General 4 Moves to 5.</p>
<p>Variation 2</p>
<p>Horse 7 Advances to 8, Elephant 5 Retreats to 4, Horse 8 Retreats to 9, General 5 Advances 1, Cannon 9 Moves to 4,</p>
<p>Pawn 6 Advances 1, General 5 Moves to 4, Horse 6 Advances to 8, General 4 Moves to 5, Horse 6 Advances to 7,</p>
<p>Cannon 4 Retreats 8 for a draw.</p>
<p>Variation 1</p>
<p>Pawn 6 Advances 1, General 5 Moves to 4, Horse 9 Advances to 7, General 4 Advances 1, Horse 7 Retreats to 5.</p>
<p>Variation 3</p>
<p>General 4 Retreats 1, Horse 5 Retreats to 4, Pawn 6 Advances 1, General 5 Moves to 4, Horse 6 Advances to 8,</p>
<p>General 4 Advances 1, Horse 6 Advances to 8, Horse 4 Retreats to 3 for a draw.</p>
<p>Variation 2</p>
<p>Horse 8 Retreats to 9, Minister 4 Advances to 5, Horse 9 Advances to 7, General 5 Moves to 4, Cannon 9 Retreats to 8 for a draw.</p>
<p>Variation 3</p>
<p>Horse 5 Retreats to 4, Pawn 6 Moves Horizontally to 5, General 6 Advances 1, Horse 6 Retreats to 8, General 5 Moves to 4,</p>
<p>Horse 8 Retreats to 6, Cannon 9 Moves Horizontally to 8, Variation 4, Horse 6 Advances to 4, Cannon 8 Retreats 6, Horse 6 Advances to 8,</p>
<p>General 4 Retreats 1, Horse 4 Advances to 3, Cannon 8 Retreats 2, Horse 8 Retreats to 6, General 4 Advances 1,</p>
<p>General 4 Retreats 1, Minister 6 Advances to 5, Horse 3 Retreats to 4, Cannon 8 Moves Horizontally to 6, Horse 4 Retreats to 6,</p>
<p>Cannon 6 Advances 1.</p>
<p>Variation 4</p>
<p>Horse 6 Advances to 8, General 4 Retreats 1, Horse 6 Advances to 7, General 4 Moves to 5, Horse 7 Retreats to 5,</p>
<p>Minister 4 Advances to 5, Horse 8 Retreats to 6, Cannon 8 Retreats 7, Horse 5 Advances to 3, Minister Horse Advances to 4.</p>
<p>According to the original work, if, after the sixth move, Horse 7 Advances to 8, and the Elephant 1 Retreats to 3, then Cannon 9 Retreats to 8 for a draw. Also, in Variation 1, if, after the seventh move, Horse 5 Retreats to 4, and Pawn 6 Moves Horizontally to 5, then the subsequent variations become complex and there is no fixed method. However, the chances of double horses winning against a lone cannon with a missing minister are very slim. It is difficult to win unless Black makes a poor move. Due to space limitations, not all variations are published. (Han)</p>
<h3>Zhang Aiyun Pleads for the Disaster Victims in Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Tianjin flood is indeed an unprecedented catastrophe. Ms. Zhang Aiyun witnessed the tragedy and expressed deep sympathy. Recently, major philanthropists in Shanghai have been organizing theatrical performances to raise funds. When discussing this with Aiyun, she readily agreed and will perform continuously for three days, starting today (the 2nd), at the Golden Theater. The plays Ms. Zhang will perform are "The Tower Sacrifice of the Scholar" on the 2nd, "The Escort" and "The Trial in the Three Halls" on the 3rd, and "The Golden Lock" on the 4th, all of which are her masterpieces. The people of Shanghai are fortunate, and the disaster victims will also benefit greatly.</p>
