<h3>五中全會决議設立　最高國防會議委員會　委員六人蔣總裁兼任委員長　設邊疆部掌甘靑新國防等事</h3>
<p>（香港）五中全會二十一日開預備會、二十二日起開正式會、二十五日已閉幕、對調整國防機構、曾加討論、將設最高國防會議委員會、較現有國防會組織更充實、蔣兼委長、委員六人、爲黨政領袖及深有資望之在野名流各二人、人選已內定、此外並擬設邊疆部、管理甘新靑康各省國防軍事及經濟交通各事、惟該部隸屬軍委會或政院尙未定、（二十六日下午十一時專電）</p>
<p>（重慶）今日爲五中全會第二日會議、專事聆取軍事政治外交黨務之報告、該會之一切决議、大的將於閉幕後公布、路透社由負責方面探息、此次大會、其精神與以前所開國民黨大會不同、蔣委員長主張會中應遵守下列三點、（一）一切報吿當重事實、（二）代表可對任何問題發問、（三）所問一切、須由負責常局竭誠作答、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>五中全會蔣總裁致辭　以事實證明抗戰必勝</h3>
<p>（續昨）明白了我上面所列舉敵人方面自造失收自作罪擊的各種事例以後、各位同志就可以知道這一决中日戰爭、如果日本能獲得勝利、那就是世界上一切戰略戰術和所有軍事學說、都要根本推翻、甚至一切事物的原則原理、都可證明爲無用了、明白了今日敵人多方脅制誘降的意義以後、各位同志、就更可以明瞭我們所應該竭力堅持的是什麼、明白說一句就是要立定决心、不屈不撓、也就是說、我們的精神絕對不要被敵人所脅制、我們更絕對不能受敵人的欺騙、我們一面要持久抗戰、奮鬥到底、不但使敵人過去「速戰速决」的目的不能達到、而且要使他現在「速和速結」的狡謀成爲粉碎、這就是我們今日唯一的方略、這就是敵之失敗、也就是我國勝利的基礎、我鄭重的吿訴各位同志、這是我以受全國安危重託的統帥地位、就十八個月來深切體念而得的結論、特別提出來貢獻於我們全會同志的、諸位同志更應該使全國同胞、明瞭我們今天務必要以宋明歷史爲車之鑒、要知道宋明的滅亡、並不是敵人外族有如何優勢的力量、而完全由於當時政府少數將吏以及社會士流意志精神的動搖畏怯、乃至全國人民受他影響、弄到全局敗壞、不可收拾、我們今天有如此良好的國民精神、有如此深厚的革命基礎、又有我們本黨適合時代的三民主義、祇要不自暴自棄、任何力量也不能滅亡我國、今天的事勢很顯明、擺在我們面前的、就是敵人必然將更兇橫的憑藉其武器兵力、來作孤注一擲的掙扎、我們的方針、却是很簡單很明瞭、我們從第二期抗戰開始以後、就要用我們革命的戰略戰術、以更奮勇堅决的抗戰根本打擊敵人已動搖的意志、已疲竭的力量、很迅速地促起敵人的總崩潰和最後失敗、來完成我們革命的任務、我再告訴我們同志一句話、我們目前如果妄想妥協、希求僥倖的和平、就無異自投羅網、自取滅亡、須知敵國前相近衛上月二十二日發表的所謂調整國交的談話、實在是誘降的文吿、而不是講和的條件、如果依此而講和平、老實說就是降服、我們中國民族有志節、有廉恥、有前途、抗戰一年有半、犧牲儘管重大、力量愈戰愈强、凡是中華民族黃帝的子孫爲要對得起我們的祖宗父母、對得起後代、對得起自身、對得起無數爲抗戰犧牲的先烈、就决無甘心降服之人、我們今天惟有全力决戰、以必死之心來抗戰、戰到達成目的之日爲止、要知降是生中求死、决無倖生之望、戰則死中求生、且有必勝之道、我現在再就我們中國抗戰自身作一檢討、我可以說、不但敵人有必敗之道、而且我國有必勝之理、孫子說「先爲不可勝、以待敵之可勝」要做到不可勝、當然要我們流血流汗來努力奮鬥、但是我們從歷史地理文化經濟以及民族精神各方面來看、拿以往事實來說、我們先天條件上、實在有使敵必不可勝的基礎、只要配合上我們人爲的努力、必可以戰勝敵人而絕無疑義、（甲）就歷史來說、我曾經說過宋明之亡、是一姓一家朝代的敗亡、不是我們中華民族的滅亡、我們中華民族五千年以來是永沒有被人屈服過的、不僅是沒有被人滅亡而已、而且宋明當時朝代的覆亡、也只是由於極少數的將吏無膽識、無氣節、只知個人苟且偸安、自私自利而不顧民族的禍福、以致數百年朝代整個覆亡、但是那時是君主專制時代、朝廷和民間隔成兩橛、痛癢旣不甚關切、人民抵抗力量也一時不能發揮、實際上當時整個民族的精神是並未受制於外族的、而且是始終與外族侵略者抵抗到底的、待到民族普遍覺醒以後、雖時隔二三百年、終能够攘除夷狄、光復河山、何况現在是以民爲主的民國時代、現在國民政府是革命的政府、亦就是國民政府、革命的政府必爲民族利益而奮鬥的、亦是爲人民利益而存在、是認識我們自己的責任、而不能受人威脅的、是要完成國民革命、實行三民主義、而絕對不怕武力侵略的、我們今日的抗戰、是政府人民意志精神與力量交互密合的一致行動、孫子所說、「道者令民與上同意也、故可與之死、可與之生、而民不畏危」、這是戰　取勝開宗明義第一個大原則、我們這一次對日抗戰、確實能做到這一個原則、我們全國一心、上下一志、在國民政府號令之下、老弱婦孺亦知殺敵自衛、皆聽的束指揮、眞是所謂「死而無怨」、更無人願出賣祖國世代的生命而想作漢奸、我國幾千年來所謂「可殺不可辱」的志氣、已經由敵寇的獸行普遍喚起、所以就歷史來說、中國决無可亡之理、從以往歷史來看、今日由民族意識及時代精神來測騐、這决的抗戰、中國更無被人戰勝征服的可能，</p>
<p>（乙）就地理來說、我國本有天然足禦外侮的地位、從前長城的建築、就是我民利用地勢以作禦敵設備的一個偉大的工程、我國而積廣大、束西經度跨有六十五度以上、自南至北、兼有寒溫熱三帶的氣候、所以我國諭述軍事的成敗、將以天時和地利、並舉內地及西部湖泊縱橫、山岳錯雜、平原沙漠、無所不備所以就而積點、過去無論任何外族、皆只能占我一部分、一時期、而不能永久佔我之全部、就是元淸兵力最盛時代、也祇能佔到幾個據點、而我們民間反抗的勢力依舊存在、普及於全國、今日敵人僅以七千萬人口、要來吞滅我人口比他大六倍以上的廣大衆庶的國家、要來消滅我具有悠久歷史的民族、豈非夢想、至於從現在抗戰地勢言、我國地形複雜、已如前段所說、再配上堅强的民氣、和入力及武器皆有窮於使用的時候的敵人相周旋、那麼就地理言、我國又必無被敵征服的可能、</p>
<p>（丙）就文化來說自有歷史以來、亞洲國家就只中國有獨立的文化、亦祇有中國以文化陶冶外族、乃至使其進而同化，决沒有任何外族外來文化能消滅我國固有的文化、至於現代科學、則是世界共有共享的文明成果、但中國文化自然有其獨特的精神、這不必廣爲徵引祇看現在我國內地鄉僻民衆、無數男女遇到敵人、每每有忠義節烈可歌可泣的行爲、就可見中國文化力量植基的深厚、敵人要想以不東不西的文化來消滅我們民族精神、他在許多淪陷區內、已經受了不少失收的敎訓、祇耍我們齊心一志、堅决奮鬥、抗戰愈久、民族正氣必愈發揚、而且在抗戰期間、將要錘鍊出我們文化史光明切實的力量、所以就文化及民族精神言、中國又决無被敵滅亡的可能、</p>
<p>（丁）就經濟來說、現在戰爭起因、往往在經濟的掠奪發動、成敗勝負也往往以經濟能吾持久爲决定因素、我國是農業國家、正在建設期中、突受暴力侵略當初原是深可顧慮的一種危機、但是自從開戰至今十八個月中間、不但我們財政基礎沒有受到如何重大影響、而且金融是始終穩定的、後方民衆的生活更沒有受到戰時的影饗、而且大多數省以由於去年農產豐收、消費節的、民間反而顯出充裕的現象、這就是因爲我們是農業國家、富有强靱的持久力、不比工業國家、容易受到戰爭影響、我們現在進入了第二期抗戰以後、深信戰時經濟决無問題、我們在抗戰根據地的西南西北諸省、積極的開發國防工業、中小工業、和鑛產林木、全國的技術人才資本、集中力量來做、必可使國家經濟建設確立永久的基礎、就是軍需民生也可不虞匱乏、我們農業國家戰時經濟持久力的堅靱、這更是敵人所未曾計及的一點、又是敵人一個最大的失敗、所以就經濟言、中國是足可長期抗戰、而沒有被敵屈服的可能、</p>
<p>現代戰爭不僅應知彼知己、允需要知道國際形勢發展的方向、敵人不但不認識自己、不認識敵人、並我們中國簡直也不認識、時代環境當然要步步趨于失敗、這一年來的國際形勢、大體說來、表面上雖然是動盪不安、而其潛伏的主流總是朝着維護信義和平的方向前進、允其是歐美幾個民治大國、應付變局非常謹愼、在民衆方面、排斥侵略、主張公道、一天天的有力、就是他們的政治家、一方面苦心孤詣的想穩定現有的局勢、同時也絕不放鬆充實自身力量的準備、從種種方面、我們都可以看得出他們有遏止侵略、維護世界和平的决心、最近這種形勢、更是日趨明顯、我們自九一八事變以來、早已看定世上唯有公理正義的道路、纔是人類共循的道路、凡是能自强自立的國家、卽使一時困苦犧牲、也是義所當然、久而久之、自然可以得到正義方面的共鳴、就最近國際演變的跡象來印證我們六七年來的觀察、實在是絲毫不爽、這不是我們有什麼先知預覺的本領、我們就是守定總理救國敘世革命的立塲、所以一切都發乎良知和正義、同志們必須明白我們總理畢生革命救中國、亦所以救世界、我們抗戰不屈的國策、就是遵奉這個實貴的遺敎、這是三民主義的革命信徒所應該一致堅决信守到庭的、我們總理嘗言中國恢復了民族地位以後、還要對世界負一個大責任、總理在民族主義及各種遺敎中、又嘗一再訓示中國是東亞的支柱、是亞洲的大邦、常中國强盛的時候、四鄰安服、衷心歸向環繞我國周圍的民族都能保持獨立、和樂共存、總理更從歷史事實指出、「我們向來未用經濟力去壓迫他族、……中國的和平思想、到漢朝時已經很充分、」我們不侮孤寡、不畏强禦、講互助、求自强、崇尙信義、反對侵略、所以總理又說「中國强盛了幾千年、而高麗猶存、在日本强了不過二十年，便把高麗滅了」這是中國向來以濟弱扶傾爲政策、以自存共存爲極則、我們國民革命就是要發揚我們這個信義和平的道德、促成世界人類共同、永久的安寗與幸福、</p>
<p>在歐洲戰爭終了的時節、總理起草了一部建國方略、目的要促成中國產業的近代化、亦就資本技術尋一個極好的出路、免得世界人類再因爭奪資源市塲而發生慘酷的戰禍、中間最緊要的一句話就是以「操之自我則存」的原則、來利用外國資本和機器、可惜這一悲天憫人救國救世的主張、沒有具體實現、反而日本利用歐戰後的時機、步步向我國侵略、九一八以來我國始終委曲忍痛、尊重和平、敵人繼續擴大侵略、漫無止境、他全不知道現在是「民族自决」和「民族主義」思潮澎湃的時代、小民族尙且要求崛起獨立、世界列强也都改變過去的態度和方式、在這樣的時代、我們敵人還妄想以七千萬人口的國家要來吞滅我四萬五千萬人民的中國、塘沽協定以後、我國立國生存、已到了最低的限度、到了這個地步、日本還耍破壞中國生命所繁的一綫生機、無端起釁、佔我平津、這一個最低限度尙且不許我們保存、那就是生不如死、存不如亡了、與共雖存猶亡、就祇有拼命奮鬥、古語說「兩軍相遇、哀者勝矣、」我們那時節萬無再不抗戰之理、我們的士氣民心完全是悲哀憤激、有死無他、這是世上有史以來從未有過的「哀兵、」而我們的抗戰、也就不僅爲捍衛本國的獨立生存、同時更爲維護世界和平與國際信義、所以我們這一戰又是堂堂正正的「義戰、」而敵人無故的侵略中國乃是師出無名的自殺自殘的「暴戰」</p>
<p>我們在開始抗戰的時候、早已算定今天的一切艱難困苦、甚至比今天還要加深十倍百倍的艱難困苦、但是這一個神聖義務旣然加到我們民族的肩頭、我們就必然一要排除萬難、以無上的犧牲來達成我們國民革命的任務、我們一定要打擊侵略、要國際條的恢復效力、要國際正義伸張、允其要以我們的堅决抗戰、蹬明暴力橫行之必敗、改移世界全體人類的視聽、永保國際的和平、同志們必須知道抗戰以前、世上視我國爲三等國家之不如、現在我們與一等强國的日本戰鬥到一年半以上、尙且不爲敵人所戰勝、我們常然不必再畏敵人的暴力、我們的前途果然還不免有很多的困難、但是抗戰進入了第二期以後、我們確信戰局必然是一天天順利、一天天接近光明、問題全在我們有沒有不屈不撓、長期持久的精神、有沒有舉國一致、愈戰愈奮的努力、</p>
<p>由於上面的叙述，各位同志可以確實認識我國自身支持奮鬥的實力、認識敵國的戰略政策、認識共他方面各種實際情勢與演變的過程、由此體悟到世界一切事物發展的必然性卽可曉然於成敗勝負之數之所在、自古大勇生於大智、我們對於抗戰之使命和前途、旣有這樣顚撲不破的正覺、就必能自然而然的生出勇往無比的决心和信心、現在我們抗戰是已經進入了第二期、無庸諱言的、我們已損失了不少的土地和大部份的交通錢、犧牲了同胞不少的生命和財產、被攫奪了無數的產業和資源、可是我們要知道革命的工作多半是從平地做起的、我們今後就要以現有的土地人力軍力財力作打算、恢復我們同盟會以前革命先烈手無寸鐵毫無憑籍而舉起義旗反抗外族統治的精神、從小處低處極艱難困苦處脚踏實地、定下具體行動的方案和計劃、定出了方案計劃以後、就要竭我們的心血時力、一條一字一句都要切實做到、敵人宣稱「戰爭要百年化」、我們認爲抗戰建國的工作是沒有時限可定的、五年不成則十年、十年不成則百年、一天不達到目的我們就一天不停息，我們怎麼樣來努力呢、我們要針對着敵人的情形來努力、今日的敵人正如孫子所謂「大吏怒而不服、遇敵懼而自戰、將不知其能曰崩」、我們知到了這點、就要以我們的統一團結來對付敵人的驕妄凌亂以下尅上的敗象、我們知道敵人在戰爭期中、工業停頓、經濟破綻日益顯露、我們就要發揮我們農業國家的特長、刻苦節的、　忍支持、來加深敵人工業國家的弱點、我們知道敵國人欲所在、是要根本毀滅我民族經濟基礎、我們就要加緊充實我們戰時一切的建設、培養持久抵抗的力量、以促起敵國社會崩潰的危機、我們知道敵國去年以來、天災流行、風災水災加以陸續發生不斷的大地震、使他們國內被迫作戰的民衆格外受到痛苦和損失、我們就應該利川我們天時地利的優點、加緊農業生產、以對抗天災人禍不可終“的島國的缺點、我們知道敵國入民痛苦日深、敵國政府統御無方、他的朝野上下反戰意　日濃一日、我們就要眞實力行我們的三民主義、來打擊敵人殘民以危害人自害的黷武主義、總之、我們今天</p>

<h3>蔣委員長訓辭與人民</h3>
<p>蔣委員長近於五中全會開慕時，躬臨致訓·全文刋載昨今二日報端；秉摯誠熱烈之至情，演博大精微之至理，剖析現實、指示方來；宣揚者，禦暴之正氣，充溢者，國族之活氣；夫文以載道，中國抗戰建國之道在此，洵昭垂百世之文獻，亦朝野奮發之軌範也。輒以此與日本首相平沼之組閣宣言與議院演說，比較觀之，無論在誠僞，虛實，曲直，是非，信疑，强弱，勇怯，智愚，偉大與纖小，有辦法與無辦法，任何一點觀之，顯見中國高於日本，顯見中國有領袖有文化，日本無政家無魂靈；是亦中國必勝，日本必敗之明徵也。委員長之言日，此以受全國安危重托之統帥地位而發言；是開宗明責任，不但必爲內外所信服，而中國之軍民與黨政人員允必奉爲思想言論行動之圭臬者也。</p>
<p>中國之軍事政治黨務，有英明賢哲之領袖悉心擘畫，綜綰於上；人民之樂於竭盡心力，因時自効，因事獻替，自無待言。顧就人民之本位以求之：遭遇之艱鉅若此，前途之光輝宏遠如彼，人民固將如之何而有裨抗戰建國？又將如之何而無負於領袖之諄諄？又必如之何而不愧爲抗戰建國之際之人民，不愧爲英明賢哲之領袖領導下之人民？今日之爲大時代，繼往開來，今日之中國人民應如何供獻於其國族，俾千百年後之子孫，翹然日，榮譽燦爛之復興歷史中乃有其祖宗之赤心赤血焉。</p>
<p>國族旣在非常患難之中，人民宜負非常重大之責　固矣，按之實際，辨其性質，抑亦平凡之甚也。惟其平凡，即人人所應爾，亦人人所克勝。或欿然於一己本能之猶不足以副平凡，或愁顏相訴於抗戰之旣喪其平凡之本能，夫是可信乎？非不思，即欺罔。試檢視經歷十九月抗戰之一般現象：彼慘罹焚殺淫掠之刦，備嘗流離顚沛之苦者，最堪同情；老者喪其子女，幼者失所怙恃，廬舍蕩然，饑寒交逼；此其人，不予救濟，且塡溝壑；救濟之責，在社會，在政府；據最近某敎會敎士之估計報吿，有待救濟者，殆有三千萬之衆云；是誠鉅數，但比之全國人口，百分之六七已耳。有待救濟者百之六七，効命疆塲者百之一，應負非常時期平凡職責之人民，猶有百之九十二三，誠竭心力，何事不舉，何功不克乎？</p>
<p>抑何謂非常時期之人民職責？以日常私人生活言之：僅有二端，日儘量節的消耗也，日勤奮增進生產也，是國族力量所繫；節消耗與增生產，即培本之道。以一般社會生活言之：要在精誠親愛，自省爲公衆之一員，母爲公衆之累，務盡一員之事；爲公衆服務，爲智力財力或體力不如己者服務。在都市城鎮，有都市城鎭之所需所不足；在農村，有農村之所需所不足；察所需所不足，不吝所私，而盡一已一日之長，但竭心力，不厭其微。以對國族言之：工役兵役完糧納稅，則奉公守法，不躱避，不諉卸，不取巧；有獻金運動則以餘力應之，有公債發行則以資產應之，皆惟力是視。凡此者，言之誠屬老生常談，顧爲之非平凡之甚乎？彼侵略國興師動衆，衆或不知何爲而戰，或明知爲軍閥財閥之功名富貴而戰；然肆虐中華，喪生異域之軍隊，固以徵兵得之者也；無貧富貴賤，名登軍籍，朝令夕行，其兵役之嚴若此。本年預算達一百萬萬元，均之以彼本島與屬地之總人口，並老叟孺婦，與負販苦力，以及流氓乞丐，乃至從軍遠征之士兵，無論男女貧賤，每人皆須付侵略軍政之費百數十元，其負擔之重若此。以此比之中國人民，謂方爲求生存，求自由，求幸福，爲國家，爲祖宗，爲子孫而在抗戰之中者，雖謂百之九十二三，固猶較愈於彼日本人，亦何不可！惟其然，謂不應各秉良知良能，以副平凡之職責乎？上有英明賢哲之領袖，下有各盡職責之人民，抗戰必勝，建國必成，時日問題而已，抑期不在遠也。</p>
<p>的要務是要以精神勝物質、以勤儉補缺乏、以加倍努力補巳往的蹉跎、以犧牲的决心和必勝的信心來補我們武器和近代軍備的不足、同志們、更必須認識本黨對於國家的責任和黨員對於革命的責任、我們在抗戰緊張中、這樣的集會不是一件容易的事情、我們要使這一决全會爲抗戰第二期定下了確實具體、貫澈到底的方針和計劃、我們自身也必須在總理遺像之前確立自身負責盡職、奮鬭到底的誓願、實行黨的决議、尊重黨的紀律、鞏固黨的基業、竭盡黨的使命、我們不必理會抗戰期中有多少枝節或困難、我們應該時刻撫衷自問、有沒有盡到我們的責任、世界上决沒有一個自强自立的革命黨、而不能領導革命以底於成功的、也决沒有一個有悠久歷史廣土衆民基礎深厚的民族、而不能求得完全的獨立平等和自由的、同志們、請記着「知難行易」是我們的信條、「自力更生」是我們的座右銘、我們只要能行能幹能快幹硬幹苦幹實幹、沒有不成功的道理、我今天以最熱烈最眞摯的精誠、期望本决全會的成功、祝我們抗戰建國革命大業的成功、（廿六日電）</p>

<p>咋晚之戰局、沉悶僵持、直至最後之八分鐘、才見打破、混合隊雖一再變更陣綫、合作上始終難達理想中之程度、表演殊見慌張、投籃因亦不準、局勢幾全在麥令控制之下、分數一再平等、相差亦常常一二分之問、混合鬱鬱不得志、麥令之攻勢、則猛而不息、幸而麥令不慣用中靑廣大之塲地、數十投籃機會、皆未命中、練慣西靑之小塲、球皆拋擲太近、用力稍欠把握、吾則混合早已殆矣、最後大局急轉、亦爲意想不及、令人慶幸、第二塲比賽、混合必能更上一層、各個表演、則當推孫惠培也、</p>
<p>臨時協定</p>
<p>由奚玉書君用中英文報告、向各方道謝後、袁履登君代表虞洽卿君開球、洽老小恙、擬於給槳時到塲、六秩壽翁拋擲第一隻球、球爲周達雲得、急傳陳學崇、一轉身已送入籃內、於是休息時麥令抗議、謂開球混合係得袁氏派司、於是變方議定、如結果相差二分、須延長五分鐘、再决勝負、事有凑巧、結果適爲二十一比十九、混合多二分、乃延長五分鐘、混合乘勢一衝、連得七分、終以二十八比二十大勝、</p>
<p>打成僵局</p>
<p>混合第一陣綫、在沈昆南君指揮之下、先以周達雲李震中陳學崇孫惠培蔡演雄登塲、麥令則淸一色之麥令紅、陳學崇旣首先中的、蔡演雄之半塲遠射、大受衆賞、周達雲繼之立功、蔡又罰中、如此混合頓時以七比零大佔優勢、麥令鎭靜不亂、連罰帶中、立時扳回四分、祥龍急調出李震中、不能遏麥令勢、薩琴晚派曼爾反以八比七超出、混合形勢甚爲不佳、合作格格不入、全在麥令砲彈之下、達雲罰中成各八、慕爾復造十比八、此時麥令以全隊全體登塲、兩方造就極少、上半時成各十平手、</p>
<p>春雲開展</p>
<p>下半時孔廣益調出周達雲、麥令仍爲全隊、又成拉鋸戰、麥令失機累累、混合急調李震中入替孔廣益、果然形勢一振、祥龍之一挪、以十四比十三佔先一分、麥令紅隊又全體登塲、達雲亦入代祥龍、戰局突然如春雲開展、蔡李及學崇連袂建功、造成二十比十五及二十一比十七之械對優勢、不料薩琴脫之一擲、成二十一比十九、延長五分鐘、此最後五分鐘、混合予麥令以措手之機會、大貓先罰中、演雄半塲一擲、兩人再各加二分、麥令僅勃倫脫二罰一中、結果成二十八與二十之比、</p>

<h3>金融　津帮一再力購　金價續向高峯推進</h3>
<p>—昨到二零三七元—</p>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、情勢依然混亂，大致則由漲而跌、終復再升、蓋全視雙方供求多寡，及外滙緊鬆爲轉移、初因承上日之餘風、且外滙受華北聯銀猛扒、故潛勢突然趨緊、因之一時買風極形蓬勃、加以天津帮暨港帮等暗中競相吸購、故而市價一度竟漲達二千〇三十七元高峯、後忽聞外滙受外電拋塞、後逐漸回平、故而一般多戶獲利傾向出籠、某銀樓代殷商允爭先力售、且某金號亦反進爲出、故價遂急轉下瀉、會破入三十元關內、卒因外滙扒風又起、致乃重復見聚、更以天津帮買意復萌、一再力購、重復上騰、終續漲八元、各方人心堅昂異常、交易亦甚熱閙、達一千兩、銀樓飾金則未見更動、海關金曁中英純金等則依然未更、</p>
<p>烚赤再軋漲八元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初因承上日餘風、目聞外滙受北帮（代偽銀行）猛扒、故而潛勢趨緊、因之塲中人心益加堅昂、買戶初開即喊二千〇三十元買進、迨至九時三刻、始見某金號進銀樓帮五十兩、二千〇三十二元爲開盤價、開後外滙仍報軟化、故而買風更盛、加以某錢兌業代天津帮曁某金號代港帮相繼力進、後雖有某銀樓代殷商獲利出節、終難壓制漲勢、棊錢兌業進某銀樓五十兩、價三十三元、某銀樓吐售後、又售予金號五十兩、價則相同、某金號又進銀樓帮五十兩、價三十五元、另一金號進錢兌業五十兩、價三十七元爲最高峯、但至十時十分、突然反動轉疲、蓋外滙因外電猛塞、已止緊回平、賣者頓時活躍、某銀樓又代殷富携塞，售予金號及某錢兌業各五十兩、價均三十五元、金號納進後、俄即吐售予某錢兌業五十兩、價三十四元、銀樓帮售予錢兌業五十兩價三十三元、銀樓帮又售予某錢兌業五十兩、價三十二元、此後買戶進意更淡、故乃破入三十元關內、金號互做五十兩、價二十八元、銀樓帮售予某錢兌業五十兩、價則相同、金號售予錢兌業五十兩、價二十七元、錢兌業售予銀樓帮五十兩、價二十五元、最後銀樓帮售予錢兌業五十兩、價二十九兀爲午牧價、午後因外滙受華銀行吸收、故潛勢軍復見緊、且某錢兌業代天津帮進意複濃、故初開即漲數元、首見銀樓帮售予某錢兌業五十兩、價三十四元、某錢兌業又進銀樓帮及同業各五十兩、價均三十五元、再進銀樓帮五十兩、價三十六元、最後錢兌業互做五十兩、二千〇三十五元爲晚收價、較上日軋漲八元、（全天十二元差度）、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇四十五元、收進二千〇三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出均無更動、大同行老慶雲等仍應原價二百〇六元、新同行亦懸原價二百〇四元、收進一百九十八元、</p>
<p>英純金三日不變</p>
<p>二十五日倫敦電、英純金每盎司依然未更、仍屬七鎊八先令八辦士半、中央銀行之中國純金（烚赤）收買價、亦仍懸原價一千二百十三元九角、掛牌海關金未更、仍爲二元三角九分九釐、上海標準標金價亦未更動、仍爲一千二百〇九元二角、</p>
<h3>英日金票交易多</h3>
<p>昨日英純金仍未動、英美匯兌回升零六二五、外匯繫要甚殷、洋行結款不絕、銀行供給不暢、外電售出亦稀、是以過程軟弱、而美匯更緊、烚赤仍因天津帮搜羅、人心高昂、雖經散戶獲利拋塞、終以籌碼乾涸、市况始終挺秀、趨勢堅硬、外幣經外匯及烚赤之提携、續趨上升、英金鎊需要較殷、上升稍多、日金票交易亦盛、公會成交稀少、僅祥豐出美金票五百元、鴻昌出香港票四百五十元、同豐出英金票一百鎊、全由動泰吸進、昨日市價、英金鎊升二角、英金票升八分、美金票升一分、香港票升六厘、法郎票升一厘、坎拿大票升二分、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>英印銀價背馳</h3>
<p>二十五日倫敦電、市面平定，交易有限、收盤後市面續平、甚鮮變動、大條銀近遠期俱縮〇六二五、紐約的銀電、美銀價依舊有行無市、又孟買銀電、印銀市仍平、現貨價勿動、近遠期則均長一安那云、</p>
<h3>現鈔需求又殷　貼現突然回昂</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、突然由穩回昂、每千元初仍盤旋三十五元之上尚平、後因現鈔需求者增多、步高至三十六元二角半、正午三十六元、下午又高達三十六元半、最後三十六元二角半、比上日又高起一元、</p>
<h3>「聯銀」吸收外滙</h3>
<p>外電雖有拋塞　英美滙價仍緊</p>
<p>滙市昨以華北偽銀行突來犯吸、並洋行等因年終將屆、故而結　頻繁、惟外銀行等大多不願供結、故　勢頗緊、一度英金最緊曾達八便士二八一二五、美金曾達十六元一二五、後幸外電及匯豐等傾來吐塞、故而逐漸轉平、唯結果終見續堅、當日成交殊旺、港匯因外銀行吸購頗力、形勢亦見軟化、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠皆縮、紐的現貨仍平、倫敦生金依然勿動、滙兌英對美未更、對法大七生丁、對滬如舊、美對英長零六二五、對法升一八七五對滬降三分、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行早開現貨賣價英滙八便士三五九三七五、美滙十六元二八一二五、較之前收均平、開後外電雖塞英金八便士三五九三七五但以銀行趁賤則扒、故乏變動匯豐掛牌未更、又白銀平衡稅揭曉縮二五、此後華北偽銀行猛吸英金僅八便士三一二五、及美匯祇十六元二五、更以洋商各行賣胃艱難、後市價冉步緊至英金八便士二八一二五、美滙十六元一二五、俄而外電重來售予英美各行美匯十六元二五、兼滙曁銀行亦賣予洋行美滙十六元一八七五與二五、及英金八便士三二八一二五至三四三七五、並以錢兌業亦售予安達荷蘭華義華比港滙由五十五元八七五至五十六元、於楚狀况漸漸回鬆、午收英金八便士三四三七五、美金十六元二五、</p>
<p>後市華銀行做英金八便士三二八一二五、及美匯十六元二五、而外商銀行界亦互相對做同價、故狀况缺乏變動、入後中外各銀行吃進錢兌業港滙僅五十五元八七五與七五、致市價稍貴、晚收銀行賣價英滙八便士三二八一二五、美滙十六元二一八七五、結果較前收英緊零三一二五、美軟零六二五、港匯軋縮六二五、茲將一天做開交易綠後、</p>
<h3>證券　公債平疲</h3>
<p>証券暗　、昨日市況比較安定、隔日十號之狂賣、已經中止、因此搖言亦漸息、一時人氣之未能振作、其根本原因、仍係此决改革以後引起現貨之流出、大戶之出公價、而進棉紗、以圖意外之利、亦係原因之一、前途若無意外之打擊、再經過數度盤旋、始有轉機、蓋其根本上幷未受若何損害也、昨日經過情形、上午起勢仍甚虛弱、先有七號及五十九號之賣出、後有三十一號及同康號之出節、供求仍甚懸殊、比之隔日再小一角至六角、午後賣氣稍斂、四號除出乙種外、餘則有相當收入、散戶亦略有補空、丙戊兩種需要較殷、故結果丙戊兩種已見回漲四角、餘仍續小一二角至四角、前途波動尚多也、成交總數的五六十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票成交中華書局股三十餘股、價爲二十三元三角云、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月二十五日（星期三）掛牌行市、仍屬有行無市、價格亦無多大變動、僅祇克利斯浦公債又升一鎊、價爲三十五鎊、英金善後公債英發債票則回落一鎊半、價爲四十八鎊、英倫實貨供給本日計有兩筆、計開中法美金五釐公債有印債票、賣出五千鎊（即美金二萬五千元）售價六十八鎊十七先令六辦士、照行市不過微抑二先合六辦七、然比上日售盤則驟縮十七先令六辦士、又津浦鐵路原發公債德發有印中籤債票亦賣出二萬五千鎊、售價十六鎊半、照市仍拾半鎊、但比上日售盤則縮小半鎊、市氣趨向疲軟、於此可見云</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月二十五日（星期三）掛牌行市、市面無變動、</p>
<h3>開平股息增高</h3>
<p>銷路激增另闢新井</p>
<p>自中日　事獲生以來、煤斤需耍激增、開　礦務局一九三七年七月至一九三八年六月止一年度間、售煤達四、二一三、〇〇〇噸、比上年度增加六七、〇〇〇噸、營業毛餘亦自國幣三、九二四、五一六元、增至國幣一二、三六八、一五七元、提去公司債緊還本付息基金國幣二、二六〇、二四二元、及折舊攤提國幣六四一、〇二三元後、爭餘國幣九、〇二三、七五三元、比上年度盈餘的增國幣三、二七一、七五六元、由英商開平煤礦公司與華商澳州礦務公司平均分派、開平煤礦公司應得之半數、折合爲英金二五二、九一四鎊、較上年度之英金一七五、〇六五鎊、計增英金七七、八四九鎊、連息金收入在內、共達英金二七二、五七二鎊、除開各項繳用後、凈餘英金二一五、二一二鎊、再去稅捐等費英金三〇、七一六鎊、股息可按週年七釐半分派、（上年爲五釐前年爲二釐半）勝餘英金三七、四九五錢、滾入下屆、目前日本華北及上海方面、於開澳煤需要大增、該局刻已另闢新井一口、預計年可增加煤產一百萬噸、自去年七月以來五個月餘之售煤紀録、計達二、二二九、〇〇〇噸、較上年同期增加百分之四十二、開平公司股東大會業於上年十二月二十九日在倫敦舉行派息後之股票行市、每股票面英金一鎊、上海市價國幣二十三元零、倫敦市價爲英金十六先令六辦士、</p>
<h3>紗花　囤戶無力再拖　紗價反動疾退　回進四百元關　日紗期貨軋空</h3>
<p>連漲　日之紗市、昨則驟告回挫、目跌勢頗劇、此種久漲以後之反動、殊不足奇、亦在意料之中，况連朝之上升、全係金融界收買之故、並非受實際銷塲擁擠之推動也、所以囤戶收買一定、同時客帮生意依然黯淡、一般浮多之現貨商、鑒於客方需要不來、脫售之念允急、塌戶亦因連日拖進、爲額殊鉅、茲有飽滿之象暫爲休息籌碼略爲一鬆懈、跌風陡熾、又二十支雙馬由四百〇五元直破至三百九十六元、繼以跌勢未免劇烈、乃引起廣帮某號復來場便宜貨、於是虛風被其止住、又復回起三元、不過查棉紗根本問題、較昔日尚可穩定一步、因原料難鬆、前途究屬如何、仍恃質際交易來扶值也、</p>
<p>查昨日現紗市塲、晨初開盤、同業相聚束手者多、探問下來、實銷仍勿動、囤戶亦不來、僅汕頭帮零星交易、然賣者雲集、二十支雙馬開價爲四百〇五元、與上日無甚軒輊、僅二包交易、客方喊賣聲不絕、人氣忽虛、市價步步下挫、二十支天女價由三百九十八元、續跌至九十六元、雙馬一跌五元爲四百元、再破大關、直釗三百九十六元、棧單價跌至三百九十四元、少頃價格一廉、廣帮萬興號來進棧單貨、囤戶亦來收、立刻回起二三元、最後收盤價二十支雙馬爲三百九十九元、棧單價爲三百九十七元、氣勢轉入穩定之途、查上午成交統計一千二百六十包、同行交易佔三分之二、結果行情二十支雙馬跌六元、天女跌六元、白飛艇跌十元、飛虎跌五元、雙地球跌四元半、十支粗紗跌風較緩、因存底較薄之故也、廠方未有舉動、今日出口有棉紗八十件運天津、五十件運烟台、二十件運泉州、三百件運汕頭、十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量錄左、</p>
<p>日紗市塲因一月底將屆、所有拋空之皮球交易、頭襯缺乏、買者不願放出、因此本紗市價已落五六元、日紗反見緊俏、市價續升、但實需零落如故、惟期貨似有軋空模樣二十支水月現紗價爲三百二十元本月份價爲三百二十一元、倒漒過現貨頭、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百十八元、下月份爲三百二十元云、</p>
<h3>外棉亦無　鉅額成交</h3>
<p>外棉市價、美棉因現貨交易盛旺、加之出口商亦有鉅額交易、市價目前頗呈堅定之象、政府貸款棉之出售問題、迄今尚未解决、故新花登塲時之棉價、殊難使人逆料也、昨日有人訪問美農部秘書亨利威爾斯、詢及擬集國際棉業會議之用意、據威爾斯氏表示、此項會議並無新奇之處、唯棉產之過剩爲世界所共有之嚴重問題、絕非美國所能解决、試舉例設將美政府所有過剩額之貸款棉向世界出售、美棉價格之跌至六分關內、勢所必然、屆時美國之經濟困難固能打破、國內之出口亦可乘機暢銷美棉、農民亦得傾售所產、而印度巴西及埃及等之植棉者及出口商將因此而受嚴重打擊矣、末後威氏語人、開國際棉業會議、係渠之意、惟絕不願前去邀請、但盼各產棉國能自動的踴躍參加、昨日紐的漲二三磅音、印度連同預測跌半羅比、埃及跌七八磅音、昨日滙兌無甚軒輊、折合法幣、美棉及巴西每担漲二角、印棉及埃及棉俱跌二角餘、</p>
<p>本市外棉交易、昨日並無鉅額交易、除安達廠訂購印棉白洛區五百包、合送廠價爲七十二元外、餘廠甚爲靜寂、大衆意見、外棉交易、如能匯兌放長、各廠因存貨將枯、均將大量採購也、茲將成交件額及價格列後、</p>
<h3>廠商停辦聲中　白包花售價仍昂</h3>
<p>本棉生意更形銷沉、白包化市價堅挺如故、廠方一致採辦印美粗細棉補充、對於本棉停辦矣、實則來源枯薄、存底已涸、售價高昂萬丈、且無巨額可購、事出不得意、非辦外棉調劑、絕無良法可救、至於花號鑒於各路運輸艱雞、北方被統制不許出口、營羣大淸、大部份販運外棉交易矣、可想本棉之缺乏也、日廠久無生氣、惟對外棉購訂非常踴躍通花來源尚不薄、碼頭到貨二千四百九十五包、又新港來五百八十件、白茆來三百三十件、北沙來九百件、出口尚有四十件運泉州、二十件邋香港、茲將現棉售盤及額量綠左、</p>
<h3>疋頭　國布囤貨交易絕旺　業外當推金融界為最　東疋手貨皆不肯輕售</h3>
<p>國布各路實銷、川滇帮以外、均趨萎縮、惟同業囤貨、交易極旺、業外當推金融界爲最、囤積數量、每批均以千百件計、軍裝粗布、亦先後有巨額成交、最近南通大生紗廠又售出十六磅雙龍粗布一百餘件、該廠各檔粗布每疋近亦一致提漲一二角、怡和粗布本街及寗·紹帮照市吸辦百餘件、威海衛帮辦雙籠等牌粗布五十包、本街染廠辦細斜四五十件、而府綢·花布·色丁·剁紋·坯布本月份定貨交解最繁、溫·甬·台帮需貨尚殷、連日仍有電報催貨、惟以銀款滙額緊縮、申莊未能暢裝、色斜·色布·漂布·漂斜·昆明·成都去額最多、續辦二千五百餘疋、江北帮泰州一帶、添辦色丁·嗶嘰·直貢·各色藍布的一千二百疋、江西廣豐以及浙路天台·遂安·紹興進胃較淡、裝辦直貢·綫呢·漂布·色布僅四五百疋、</p>
<p>東布昨細布·細斜售盤、因實銷與囤日元相互拉提、逐步升騰、細布尤爲需要、龍頭彩球兩牌視爲標準、每疋激漲一角半、細斜升漲五分至一角、全日售開各牌細布·細斜、本街染廠及場貨心思之團戶、進達二千餘件、天津帮寫進亦近千件、一般同業心理鑒於行盤之高昂、抵補困難、即有手貨、亦皆扳緊不鬆、故市勢甚堅、</p>
<p>出口今日有疋頭四百件運烟台、四十件運與化、二百六十五件運泉州、一百五十五件運汕頭、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市紊亂</h3>
<p>用戶白廠價漲百元　印非洋行突辦士絲</p>
<p>昨日絲市、日美同形堅乎、交易所市情紐的微升五釐、橫濱則盤漲一元、本埠英法外銷仍未開展、本埠市情、用戶市價高出洋行三十元、故絲市重心仍未轉移、但用戶交易、頗欠標準、且購者每因過份樂觀所致、絲市乃難免紊亂、昨日白廠B字一般售價爲一三六〇元·質地較佳之B級絲牌二〇—二二條份已逼近一千四百元關、計共成交三五十担、印非洋行昨突浩躍、千金白土絲昨做開五十担、市價五百五十元、較前計升五元至十元、（按用戶白廠價、較月前已漲起一百元）</p>
<h3>糧食　麵粉北銷突暢　今日出口亦不弱</h3>
<p>昨現粉市銷突暢、晨初客帮交易、頗爲熱閙、華北方面某大戶亦在市吸收、故成交逐增、其他烟台秦皇島等處各散帮、進胃隨之見貪、南洋帮去化亦轉踴躍、市面立見活潑、統市售開二三四號各牌粉共六七萬包、由本街辦去近萬包、其餘冀魯帮爲多、汕間帮次之、車船各牌二號粉價守四元八角原盤、藍船牌四元六角、紅籃漁翁四元四角、紅財神四元三角五分、市面巳覺穩定、</p>
<p>今日麵粉出口、計七千包運天津、三千包運烟台、一千四百包運興化、一千五百包運秀嶼、一萬八千五百包運汕頭、</p>
<h3>小麥廠需較強　惟漲跌則兩難</h3>
<p>昨小麥市况、漲落兩難、續呈盤旋之局、查各廠進胃、較前爲增、蓋近日各地到源不多、咋出新港來六百包、貨方以產價連雜費成本、反比申市爲高、均不願忍痛貶脫、廠方見勢難抑、漸露貪意、結果成交依然不多、計開蕪湖紫皮麥及潮麥二千包、江北浦鎮麥共三千包、由福新阜豐兩廠合辦、最高價仍爲四元八角、中次暗堅數分、</p>
<h3>米市難以進展</h3>
<p>棧存擁擠銷路呆木</p>
<p>國米　昨共到河下十四號、車輪包子六千餘包、銷塲猶　滯溫、聞滬埠各堆棧存貨擁擠、的有七十萬包、致人心恐慌、大囤戶如欲進貨、有感無處存積之概、本街因睹市面不穩、亦鮮問津、故各貨大都未能售開、市勢呆木、是以厚薄粳行情、積落幾分至一角、杜洋尖埠尖亦跟跌角許、惟變元仍以貨稀、且脚地較硬、猶守原盤、</p>
<p>客秈　咋日來源、續有車輸運到、內由滸浦來一千八百包、新辦雖已不劃通運、然辦存之貨尚在絡繹赴申中、大戶行販尚欲堅守以待善價、而小戶則擬從速了結、且被本尖到多銷細銳落一角之影響、京蕪各秈遂被抑低五六分、前喊十一元之高京秈、亦肯十元〇八九角雋出、而中關鞠　暗盤則又降進十元大關云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆市氣活躍</h3>
<p>黃豆到頭、因夏曆年關日近、大部份販運商已趕前結束、故來源見稀、且存底父簿良以市况在銷塲活躍之下、逐見挺秀、首推上中貨最俏、蓋因辦胃避重就輕、所以昨市再漲五六分，成交各豆二千餘包、去路仍爲港呂汕厦本街等五六帮辦胃、至進出口情形、昨有二千六百五十包豆子、由天津運來、生仁二千二百包、由烟台運來、花生二百二十包、由威海衛運來、今（二十七日）有豆子一千零九十包、運汕頭、又七百九十包、運往香港、一千零二十包、運泉州、又四百八十包、運往秀嶼、運往其他各埠、有一千八百四十包、生仁二百包、運往汕頭、父百二十包、運泉州、又三千三百十包、運往香港、又豆餅一萬一千片運汕頭、一千七百片運興化、八千二百片運泉州、五百五十片運秀嶼、生油二百件運泉州、二千三百五十運香港、又咋由威海衛來三千五百聽、</p>
<h3>麩皮急轉直上</h3>
<p>麩皮內地銷塲、在此臘月內搜難甚勁、且有一部份園戶扶持、致前咋兩日來市氣急轉直上、昨市阜曁大包先由三元二角七分開盤、即升至三元三角、結果三元三角半收市、大勢轉瞬慶曆年關將屆、囤胃大都量力進取、市塲中活動　碼勢感短絀、故實需殷切、市價易於向榮云、</p>
<h3>糖市　海南赤再升二角</h3>
<p>昨糖市交易較靜、趨勢平定、公會劃盤二四荷粗白現貨呌二十四元八角半、本棧貨二十五元、轉口貨十六元八角、太古車白依然呆定、B嘜東棧貨二十三元八角半、西棧貨二十三元九角半、下檔亦乏更動、國糖號盤如潮帮之奇白枝洋陳潮靑等、續有開出、爲數不多、價亦如故、粵帮新到之白包海南赤、色光較佳、計二百〇一包、開十二元四角、比前盤升二角、閩帮僅開出次白數十包、原價未動、上白糖因產區貨乏、貨主均囑扳守、一致喊升、但申市以車白較宜、未能過漲也、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵皮隨到隨銷</h3>
<p>黑鐵皮市面、近頗俏俐、熱水瓶廠銷胃浩繁、搪瓷廠進意亦濃、故市上流通貨有感缺乏、前昨以來新太古·其昌。公和祥諸棧、均有新貨裝到、但所到之貨、大半均巳拋出、是以市上現貨仍感不多、行情因此尚能擯持不跌、刻市二六尺貨售二十四元、三六尺貨開價自二十五元至二十七元不一、頭子貨開十五元五角、副號坯子貨售十四元、查咋市銷出共有二三千担之多、但均係本街廠家辦進、客帮殊少指辦云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　青餅日輪有運到</h3>
<p>子自天津來</p>
<p>靑餅連日因有日輪運到六七百包、已不虞缺乏、市勢驟見回鬆、昨聞開十三元、决之十二元八角至十二元六角、上檔因亦轉降、耿餅爲十六元、箱莊排餅爲十四允、次之十三元八角、內地帮　有續辦、但以到貨旣增、售方當難堅持、</p>
<p>昨有二百五十包棗子自天津運來、</p>
<h3>來函　申新所買之印棉　乃是福家洋行經售</h3>
<p>逕啟者、據會員吉豐花號函稱、本日申報商業新聞外棉交易欄、載申新進印棉現貨三百件、此棉爲某株式會社所有云云殊與事實不符、敝號於本月二十四日向本市外商福家洋行買進印棉現貨棧交三百件、每祖現鈔六十四元、旋於同月二十五日售於申新二廠送廠價每担現鈔六十五元三角、均有成單可證、應請貴會函請更正等情、據此、查來函所稱各節、均係實情、並有成單證明、貴報調查所得、顯有不合、事關商人信譽、應請迅予更正、以昭實在、此頌申報編輯、撰祺、上海市棉花號業同業公會啟、廿八年一月廿六日、</p>

<h3>鴨汁之功效</h3>
<p>— 秦伯</p>
<p>雞汁牛內汁功效已著　鴨汁為病後之滋養品</p>
<p>滋養必須適合體質，鷄汁牛肉汁之功效，人所盡知，而尚有鴨汁爲溫熱病後滋養之無上妙品</p>
<p>先從理論上言：溫熱病最易燔灼氣血，耗傷津液，故病後多口乾形萎便閉溲黃等虛熱現象，鴨性質甘寒，甘能補中，寒能淸熱，故主補中，除客熱，利臟腑及水道。（見本草綢目）用以調養溫病，恰具堅壁淸野之妙。</p>
<p>再從實騐上言：溫熱病大勢巳平，形神困頓，食慾呆鈍，以鴨汁進服，但覺淸腴可口，漸思引食，不必潤腸之劑而六便自暢，無用利水之方而小溲自長；四五日後，功效大著，遠在洋參石斛等上。</p>
<p>製汁之法，與鷄汁同，惟鴨汁上面飄浮之油，務須除凈，但飲淸液，量可不拘多少。由此引伸，凡陰虛內熱之體，欲求滋養，亦舍此莫屬矣。病人之受余指示而收效者甚衆，不能褸述，倘見此文而加以證明，尤感。</p>
<h3>遺精</h3>
<p>— 謝也農</p>
<p>遺精之病，在靑年羣中，患者頗爲普遍，夢遺致病的原因，由於自瀆行爲之結果者，實占多數，這是個教育上的問題，姑置勿論。在病情上尚無夢遺精一種。其病理則大都是腎臟虧弱，精管失却攝護之力，以致頻頻遺洩，輕者月遺四五决，重者八九次。初息遺精的人，每多忽視之而不加以注意，或因羞對人言，不肯就醫診治，任令病勢漸趨嚴重，久而久之，體質日益衰弱，延成面色光白，精神痿倦，記憶薄弱，頭眩耳嗚，腰痠，形瘦等虛弱現象，影響靑年之學業與事業，實非淺鮮，患是病者，應知所警惕矣！</p>
<p>芡實，又名鷄頭子，七八月間，弄里中常有挑担呌賣鮮鷄頭者即是。（半時各南貨店中有售）此物味甘澀，有固腎，補脾，益精，治夢遺滑精之功效，常食能治無論新久之遺精。服法將芡實洗凈，入水煮熟，加白糖少許，作點心食之；或將芡實研爲細末，和以白糖，用開水冲服，叉一法用粳米二兩，芡實一雨，每天煮粥食之。此二法寓療病於飮食之中，且價格低廉，旣經濟，又簡便，病遺精者不妨一試。</p>
<p>尚有運心亦可佐爲點心，暑期蓮荷盛時，有蓮鬚一種，本爲藥店收去作爲治遺精白帶之藥，如留心得新鮮蓮鬚，以之煮茶，治遺精奇效，再有米仁（即苡仁米）金櫻子（菓類食物）二種亦治遺精食養妙品。</p>
<h3>附子</h3>
<p>— 劉民叔</p>
<p>風癱及預防風癱</p>
<p>附子形同芋艿，原非奇異之物，產於四川，川人固多以爲食品也。風俗習尚，凡覺身重，卽用附子和牛肉，同煮佐餐，不但適口充腸，確有預防風癱之功效，服之日久，輕身健行，精神倍佳。若不久煮，則必發麻而已，江浙閩粵，地卑近海，易病風寒濕庫之疾，欲預防者，可試煮服。法用牛肉半斤，白附塊一兩，生薑一塊拍碎，同煮六小時，勿放鹽，若不能淡食者，則加鹽少許亦可。食時白附塊亦宜細嚼而食，若已患風癱麻木酸痛者，常服必騐。</p>
<h3>凍瘃兩方</h3>
<p>— 龔醒齊</p>
<p>（其一）</p>
<p>冬天手足，受冷過度，氣血凝滯，瘀血破出血管之外，聚爲紅塊，即生凍瘃，見熱反先發癢，繼之潰爛；若不將凝滯瘀血解散，則愈爛愈深，久不收口。此方以解凝活血爲治法，方用茅薑八錢，吳萸四錢，紅花四錢，煎水洗滌患處，不問凍瘃已潰未潰，均極有效。未潰煮經此洗滌，瘀血和散，則不致潰爛；已潰者亦須先散凝緊之瘀，方能活血生肌，否則經春不愈，遺息實深。勞動者因此不能行動，尤爲可憐。富貴之家，此症纏身，亦殊痛苦。此方藥雖不奇，洽理正當，取之極易，用之不費，屢用屢騐，愈人不少，重者多洗幾决。特此公佈，以濟流離寒苦者稍解手足之痛苦，亦所願也。</p>
<p>（其二）藍曉梅</p>
<p>西北風起，患凍瘡的朋友，個個要愁眉　額的擔着心事了。它非但會紅腫，發熱，並且癢得難熬，潰爛後出水，結痂而不落，再發熱，又發癢，出水，一連的延綿三四個月。</p>
<p>凍瘡的成內是濕氣滯留在徵血管裹，被冷風一吹，就和血凝結而發炎，因此紅腫，發熱，發癢，而至潰爛。雖然治凍瘡的方法很多，但都是表面上的治療，不能澈底，所以治療得不能斷根；而且濕氣總要找出路，不發凍瘡，即發別的病，結果仍是免不了痛苦。</p>
<p>現在我可以介紹一張很有效的方子：在凍瘡已成紅腫塊的時候，急用川桂枝五錢，核桃仁五錢，杜紅花三錢，川撫芎二錢（中藥鋪買）拿來煎水，的半面盆，煎透乘熱洗患處，早晚各一次，藥與水勿棄去，可再煎冉洗，的洗十餘次，使它不潰而塊消；消後每天用橘皮一錢五分，生米仁三錢，粉豬苓一錢五分，宋製半夏一錢，前湯代茶，三五天，如不厭可多服幾天，此後便不易再患。如再患，仍如前法，洗服最多不過三次，永不再發。其原理如下：洗方是通經活絡，和血脈的，服方是化濕而不燥，無論屬寒屬熱，都可以用，效騐非常。息者可一試之！</p>
<p>補品小譜</p>
<h3>牛肉</h3>
<p>— 張汝偉</p>
<p>牛肉　性質溫和，滋味淡而稍甘，無羶氣，富於滋養質。功能健脾胃，長氣力；取肉熬膏，俗稱霞天膏，卽牛肉汁是，溫養脾胃，大補元氣。其脂足以潤燥通便；共乳可解熱毒，補虛癆，兼治反胃噎膈；共膽食之明目，亦能治金瘡。煮牛肉時或用栗子，或蕷薯，或菠菜，至極爛時食之；</p>
<h3>黑棗使君肉能云蟲積</h3>
<p>— 丁濟民</p>
<p>小兒虫積，患者頗多，此係誤食帶有虫卵之食物而起。（故生菜魚介等類均須煮極熟。否則不免帶有可孵化之虫卵。）初起腹部腫脹不舒，消化不良，大便不調，或發熱及喜食異物，身體日益瘦削，面黃神疲，煩躁不寗，睡中磨牙等象。可用使君子（中藥舖有售，卽西藥山道年）夾於黑棗內蒸熟，以飼小兒。每决的啖黑棗五六枚，服後三四小時，再服輕瀉藥一劑。（市上銷售之方便丸亦可。）連服二三日，卽可袪虫凈盡。此法曾見於歐氏內科學中，亦譽爲中國最佳之袪虫藥。蓋使君子爲我國數千年來之袪虫聖藥，夾以黑棗，更兼和胃安中之妙矣。</p>
<h3>酒之利弊</h3>
<p>— 張汝偉</p>
<p>習尚以酒爲不良之飮品，然酒之爲物，功能解鬱結，消戾氣，雷　砲製藥法，多以酒炒酒煮者，藉酒之味以行藥力，更有用酒洗酒冲酒煎者。是則酒之於人，亦不無效益矣。酒有甘苦辛酸之味，有興奮刺激之性，其性熱而質濕。老人少服，用以解寒壯膽，和血養氣，通關節，利經絡，均有特長。他如五茄皮酒，虎骨木瓜酒，社瘋酒等，在治療上亦有相當功效。惟酒多飲必醉，醉後行動失常，且易傷腦；而腹賬黃疸，疾飲，反胃，消渴等症，由飲酒而起者亦甚多。醉酒之法，有葛花解醒湯，或煎鷄距子濃汁灌，或淸醬油湯頻服亦可。</p>
<h3>如何調和口味　談「過藥」食物</h3>
<p>— 倪息</p>
<p>現在一般人，對於平時的養生，病中的禁忌，和病後調理的東西，大概都有些認識；而對於服藥「過口」一道，大家很少注意，其實攸關病體藥力，大有進出，所以特地先把這一點提出來談一下：</p>
<p>人們有病，需要服湯藥的話，難免上口苦澀，艱於下喉，甚至一見藥碗，先作惡心，因此不得不假借些適口有味的東西，來調濟這苦澀的味覺。</p>
<p>普通人總認爲病有藥力抵擋，對於過藥物品，不妨隨意，只消解苦爽口就可，豈知遇到有反病理藥性的食品，那就要發生很大的影響，譬如寒濕或濕熱病，藥方上用乾姜，半夏，陳皮，或蒼朮，黃運，厚朴等味的，雖覺口燥，宜用淡味糖菓，或靑鹽陳皮佛手等品，若貪食生冷水果，脾胃被寒濕侵犯了，恐怕非但藥力失效，反多嘔惡的變症。　如燥熱火症，藥方上用元參，生地，石美，知母等味的，纔宜用水果凉潤之品，若喜食辣味或濃甜之物，熱邪逗遛，病情或許要增劇和延長。譬如虛弱病，藥方上用人參，黃著，白朮，當歸等味的，宜用糖菓，甘溫，或香味等品，苟因病中習慣忌口，仍食醬釐葡，大頭菜等，未免要把藥性消尅。譬如實積病，藥方上用枳實，大黃，檳榔，神麯等味的，宜用濃茶，咖啡糖，水菓糖等品，倘猶食餅糕粘膩，薰炙等類，未免助長病氣，减輕藥力。</p>
<p>所以過藥物品對於病體藥力，合與不合，確乎大有關係，大概可分三類：　甜味的，如糖菓之類，宜於輕性感冒症，和一切調理藥，　鹹味的，像靑鹽橄欖，陳皮，佛手，椒鹽桃片之類，宜於喉風熱症，和一切理氣藥，　凉潤的，像各種水菓之類，宜於火熱燥症，和養陰之藥，但是無論服何種湯藥，要求藥性發揮迅速，病理絕沒妨礙，還是熬些苦味，一呷直下，然後用白開水一杯，漱口兩三决，或帶喝一二口，纔是頂好的辦法，否則，要用過藥，也得特別注意。</p>
<h3>傷寒症之病情變化及食養程序（三）</h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>傷寒之病情變化，旣如前述，全文未畢，今言食物調養程序，概括述之，可以定爲四個標準：有熱時須嚴守一「餓」宇，退熱時須守一「愼」字，病愈貪食時須守一「節」字，病愈虛疲時須守一『養』字。</p>
<p>傷寒有熱時期，千萬要『餓』，傷寒之是吾能愈，一方面爲醫生之責，一方面全視病者是吾能守此『餓』字，俗語有言『傷寒餓不煞』即勤病家凡屬傷寒宜於久餓，久餓亦不致死，母以久餓不食爲慮是也。</p>
<p>傷寒病源在於腸胃，以淺近之理由喻之，可以指爲傷寒之熱，由於腸中壅塞而起，腹中腸部積滯發炎，飽塞猶如『獵腸一節』；腸中邪滯一日不淸，寒熱亦一日不退，必待「藥以疏通；餓以消滯』，而後寒熱大减，病勢始有化險爲夷之望。</p>
<p>是以發熱時苟進飲食，不啻增加腸中積滯，使腸炎加甚，病症日益深刻，常人以爲不食則飢，三日不食則病，七日不食則死，於楚寒熱十餘日後，每以不食為慮，時欲予以食物，甚至不遵醫生可嚀，暗中予以食物，傷寒病人有治之不愈者，此一極普通之原因也。</p>
<p>須知傷寒病時，消化機能已因腸中壅塞而全部停頓，無須食料以供消耗，故病者歷極長時期並不知飢，其時日之久長，視病症而定，一月不食爲極普通之事。</p>
<p>或疑人身發熱時期消耗體力甚烈，久餓體必不支，此一疑問，恒爲傷寒喪身之原素，須知發熱時期，苟入虛疲之境，醫生用藥，早有　養之藥品，包括於方藥之內，奚疑應爲。（未完）</p>

<h3>孫中山先生論　中國飮食合於食養原理</h3>
<p>— 姚若琴</p>
<p>嘗讀康烈德「孫逸仙與中國之覺悟」一文，云先生十八歲時，肄業於廣東博濟醫院，迨一八八七年香港西醫大學堂成立，遂轉學該堂，勤讀五年，以首屆第一名畢業，即設醫院於葡屬澳門，聲名籍甚等語。可知先生對於醫學，固三折肱而九折臂矣。特是志在屋淸社而建民國，初不屑以醫名，故旋即併志一心，從事革命，不復以靑裏濟世矣。</p>
<p>茲覓得遣著一節，亟爲錄出，貢獻讀者，以見先生縱習西醫，而於國醫優點，仍極力保存，即飲食之徵，亦揄揚備至也。若琴誌</p>
<p>我國近代文明進化，事事皆落人之後，惟飮食一道之進步，至今尙爲文明各國所不及，中國所發明之食物，固大盛於歐美，而中國烹調法之精良，叉非歐美所可並駕，至於中國入飲食之習尙，則比之今日歐美最高明之醫學衛生家所發明最新之學理，亦不過如是而己。</p>
<p>何以言之，夫中國食品之發明，如古所稱之八珍，非日用尋常所需，固無論矣，即如日用尋常之品，如金針·木耳·豆腐·豆芽等品，實素食之良者，而歐美各國並不知其爲食品者也。又如肉食，六畜之臟腑，中國人以爲美味，而英美人往時不之食也，而近年亦以美味視之矣。吾往在粵垣，會見西人鄙視中國人食豬血以爲粗惡野麽者，而今經醫學衛生家所研究而得者，則豬血涵鐵質獨多，爲補身之無上品，凡病後產後及一切血薄症之人，往時多以化煉之鐵劑治之者，今皆用豬血以治之矣。蓋豬血所涵之鐵，爲有機體之鐵，較之無機體之化煉鐵劑，允爲適宜於人之身體。故豬血之爲食品，有病之人食之，固可以補身。而無病之人，食之亦可以益體，而中國人食之，不特不爲粗惡野蠻，且極合於科學衛生也，此不過食品之一耳。其餘種種食物。中國自古有之。而西人所未知者。不可勝數也。</p>
<p>夫悅目之盡，悅耳之音，皆爲美術。而悅口之味，何獨不然，如烹調者，亦美術之一道也。西國烹調之術，莫善於法國，而西國文明，亦莫高於法國；是烹調之術，本於文明而生。中國烹調之妙，亦足表示文明進化之深也。昔者中西未通市以前，西人只知烹調一道，法國爲世界之冠。及一嘗中國之味，莫不以中國爲冠矣。近代西人之遊中國內地者，以赫氏爲最先，當淸季道允年間，彼會潛行各省而達西藏，彼所著之遊記，稱道中國之文明者不一端，而允以中國調味爲世界之冠。近年華僑所到之地，則中國飮食之風盛傳，在獎國紐的一城，中國菜館多至數百家，凡美國城市，幾無一無中國菜館者，美人之嗜中國味者，舉國若在，遂至令土人之操同業者，大生妒忌，於是造出謠言，謂中國人所用之醬油，涵有毒質，傷害衛生。致的他睞市政廳有議禁止華人用醬油之事。後經醫學衛生家嚴爲考騐。所得結果，即醬油不獨不涵毒物，且多涵肉精，其質與牛肉汁無異。不獨無礙乎衛生，且大有益於身體。於是禁令乃止。</p>
<p>中國人之飲食習尙，暗台於科學衛生，允爲各國一般人所望塵莫及也。中國常人所飲者爲淸茶，所食奢爲淡飯，而加以菜蔬豆腐，此等食料，爲今日衛生家所考得爲最有益於衛生者也。故中國窮鄉僻壤之人，飮食不及酒肉者，常多上壽。又中國人口之繁昌，興乎中國人拒疾疫之力常大者，亦未嘗非飮食之暗合衛生有以致之也。</p>

<h3>介紹六種滋養食品</h3>
<p>— 胡祥麟</p>
<p>每屆冬令，體弱多病之人輒延醫進補，以資療養。然「藥補不如食補，」昔人早有明訓。茲將有益無損之滋養食品介紹數種如下：</p>
<p>鷄汁　製法：以黃雌童鷄去毛及皮骨翼翅頭足，用瓷罐盛貯，加酒少許，隔湯煎透，但飮共汁；自己煮製，對於熱度每無標準，易於成爲鷄湯」效力大爲减遜，市上專家製售鷄汁者，人多服之，奏效奇宏，凡家庭無專入留意煮製者宜更易之。</p>
<p>鷄汁之爲無上滋養品，已爲中西醫所公認，肺病食鷄，獲益允鉅，病後產後食之，補益亦大。（求完）</p>
<p>本期地位擴充爲一版半讀者注意</p>
<h3>貧血症　食餌療法</h3>
<p>— 張贊臣</p>
<p>貧血之症候，爲皮膚及粘膜蒼白，身體倦怠，並屢發頭痛頭暈耳鳴惡心心等症。共原因大都爲赤血球新生之障礙，或减少，及消化不良，營養不給所致。治療難有藥物與輸血等法，然方藥非普通人所能運用，輸血則惟官於大量之出血。若慢性貧血症，自以食餌療法最爲相宜。茲略舉對於貧血症有裨益之會物數種，以爲家庭療養之叻。</p>
<p>食餌療法者，乃攝取食物中含有多量之營養，以補充其不足之血液成分也，就功效而言，當以肝臟爲最佳。故近年西藥商多以肝臟製成浸膏，爲內服劑及注射劑，嚴然一種成藥，奈余於治療上經多時之試騐，遇有貧血者，每囑其購食牛肝鷄肝或猪肝，爲尋常菜饌之品，頗多良效。因肝臟內確含多量營養素。</p>
<p>他如植物中之菠菜，大豆，薯獲，白菜，花生，棗子，葡萄等，含鐵質亦多，滋養成分亦富，能隨意常啖，獲益必多，蚊之服藥治療受益多矣！</p>

<h3>宗派和主義</h3>
<p>— 楊晋豪</p>
<p>有因宗派和主義有因主義而結成的宗派，也有把宗派當做了主義。</p>
<p>因主義而結成的宗派，其所論，所行，所爭，是爲求貫澈其所認爲眞理的主義；因而，在論·行·爭的過程中，可能使各宗派的非·曲·惡的成份暴露而克服，是·直·善的成份顯著而高昂。結果，或則所有的宗派，一致向着明朗化了的眞理，共同努力；或則反眞理的宗派分崩離析，而合眞理的宗派擴大發展。到最後，那門戶之貝的宗派，終於演化而爲唯」眞理的集團；那時，卽有所宗，但已不成爲派。</p>
<p>把宗派當做了主義，則其所論，所行，所爭，便只斤斤於其名利所依附的宗派；無非想藉其宗派的壟斷，以謀其個人的升發。因而，在論·行。爭的過程中，盡爲私欲所控制，而完全失掉了理性。他們不問是非·曲直·和善惡，只知對於異己者造謠誣蔑·吹毛求疵·曲解攻訐，務使其不能出頭，或傾倒敗落；而對於同一派則捧場標榜。帮罵帮打，互爲庇護，求其能惑亂人心，而高踞覇位。但其旣以宗派爲主義，亦必以個人爲本位，所以在宗派之中，又有同夥間的名利權位之爭：以致無論對外對內，常存猜忌之心，弄得面紅耳赤，强聲蠻氣，說不淸一點道理。</p>
<p>自吾國抗戰運動高漲以來，爲求全國的統一團結，對於宗派，已經下了不少的批判。最近來，各黨派各團體的宗派的劣根性，確已革除了不少；但在繼續作怪着的也仍然有。這是因爲，在第一種因主義而結成的宗派，當認識了抗戰是眞理以後，就自然而然地化解了他的宗派性，一致地奔赴於抗戰：但在第二種以宗派爲主義的宗派，旣只求其能够壟斷升發，勢必不問眞理蔑視抗戰，企圖用其宗派性的發展來消滅異己。像這一種宗派，一旦爲正義的勢力起而與以奇擊，便就不擇手段，甘心去作洋奴漢奸，以夢想苟延或竟甚至於抬高共宗派的地位。</p>
<p>所以，我們對於第二種的宗派，無論其爲那一部門，都須繼績加緊而且不姑息地予以批判肅淸！</p>
<h3>野火</h3>
<h3>送禮</h3>
<p>— 頻</p>
<p>陽歷一月，正是冬的季節，太陽雖高掛在天空，但是沒有絲毫暖氣，北風儘是呼呼的在吹，似乎是在與我們爲難，我們都穿了不相稱的布褂，摸索摸索的在這已經發白的堤岸上走。面對着尖厲的北風，身上在發抖，但是嘴裹却還在高嚷：「從軍好，從軍好，起得早，睡得早……」的軍歌。我們雖然冷，誰也沒有停留，還是急急的向目的地趕去。</p>
<p>我們都咬緊了牙關，手握着盒子，眼注視着在前方那廣闊的河面。河上，七八隻小船慢慢的向我們划來，一些近一些，最後都停了下來。老關，那一個有趣的弟兄，他拿出魚網，像煞有介事的放下了水。接着，每雙船都放下了網。可是他們手難然牽着網，眼却凝視着前面，右手也正握着扳機。這七隻放下了魚網的漁船，一羣。着不相稱布褂的鄉下佬，正悠逸的蕩漾在河中，但是誰又知道他們的內心呢？</p>
<p>風吹在水面上，起了些微的浪花，太陽也巳經收了笑臉，慢慢的西下了。可是河面上還楚很寂靜，不要說我們送禮的船不來，就是尋常的民船也很少。這樣一分一秒的過去，使我們心焦了，嘴啃着乾硬的餅，眼雖還注視着前方，却已經有些倦了。難道我們所得的情報錯了嗎？我們誰都如此想着。</p>
<p>太陽又向西斜了一些，天也快要黑了，才遠遠望見有一串船在向我們駛來。己經麻木了的神經，又電振了一下。給愈駛愈近，裏面的人也看得淸了：船一共是五隻，每隻船上有三個荷槍的傢伙，和二個同胞，他們，含着淚一推一拉的使船前進。</p>
<p>五隻船離開我們僅僅二百米突了，七隻網魚的小船收起了網，向旁邊散了開來，歡迎他們。岸上，七個喬裝的鄉下佬也蔭蔽了起來，於是一切又歸於靜寂。風還是呼呼的在吹，吹在水面上，起一個一個的水波。</p>
<p>五隻船愈駛愈近了，又近了：一百米，不，五十米了。</p>
<p>「拍」一隻漁船中發難了，於楚七只小網船又前前後後攏了過來。在岸上的我們，睜着眼，抖撤着精神，指握着扳機等待着機會的來臨。「拍，拍，「拍，拍，拍，」連續不斷的搶聲，使這批「×軍」着慌了，忙着舉槍，還槍，又忙着頭向船頭裹縮。不一會，五隻船已經弄得首尾不能相顧了。但七隻小網船却一些一些的靠近了，槍擊也慢慢的稀了下來。我們遠遠的望去，倒的楚倒了，沒有倒的高舉着手。便裝的弟兄却一個個骨碌碌的上了他們的大船。</p>
<p>「不准發槍，呌他們繳械得了，」遠遠傳來這麽一聲，由聲音上判別，這楚張連長。天已經暗了下來。</p>
<p>李班長的船慢慢的近岸了，電筒的暗號集合了我們。跳上船知道送來的禮物只收到了叫船，另外一船是連人沈了。同時還俘獲了三個送禮的「×軍」。等我們回營，天已黑了。</p>
<p>偶而在一個傢伙身畔發見了一張女人的照片，無疑，這正楚望着他回去的眷屬，可是如今，她們也許不會知道他已做了我們的槍下鬼吧。</p>
<p>四船禮物中，倒有三船是馬糧，很慚愧，我們沒有馬，只能連船沉了。其餘一船有米，有鹽，還有慰勞的「武運久長」香烟。這决我們雖然忙了一天，可是沒有落空。</p>
<h3>報業大觀</h3>
<p>— 楊非</p>
<p>——讀「中國近代之報業」</p>
<p>報紙已經成了近代人類每日不可缺少的精神糧食；尤其在高級文化人，一天不看報就好像少吃一頓飯似地要覺得不舒服。所以，看報一事，决不只爲消遺，而主要的是在充實見聞知能，吸收精神的養料。</p>
<p>我們在每天看報之外，如能進一步地去探討報業的詳情，實能輔助我們對於報紙的理解史加深刻；正好像愛讀文藝創作的人，也常進一步地去研究文學理論和創作經騐等，以求能更精當地體會創作的內容一樣。</p>
<p>「中國近代之報業」，（趙君豪著，申報館經售，價八角）是最新出版的一冊綜合論述報業的書；它不但適應看從事於報業者的閱讀，並且也很適宜於研究新聞知識者閱讀。</p>
<p>本書近已再版，除把初版十二章中「戰時之採訪」一章，增添村料，重新改寫外，父加上「報紙發行」「報業管理」與「新聞法制」三章。據說著者服務新聞界垂十六年，並曾仟幾處大學的新聞講座，刊行過幾種報紙和著作；以他這樣豐富的經騐，精博的學識，來撰述本書，自然要比過去出版的同類書籍高明得多了。</p>
<p>現在把我細讀一過後的印象，擇要記在後面：</p>
<p>觀點正確：他說一報紙之元素一是大衆化，教育化，時代化，民族化。一報紙之內容，……應以大衆之利益爲利益，大衆之是非爲是非，斷不容有一專私見存於其問。……文字以淺顯爲貴，專實以簡明爲主。」「應於選稿或編輯之際，……將優良之事跡，予以宣揚，卑劣之描寫，竭力减削。」「應隨時代以進展，尤應領導大衆以謀適應時代。」「一方面固應將舊社會的遺留，予以淸除，一方面允須努力於民族獨立國家完整之使命。一這些論見，以及關於其他理論和實際問題的闡說，都是很正確的。並且，就是對於別的文化部門，也都可適用。</p>
<p>材料豐富：凡有關於報業的各種材料，在本書中都被搜集論述。他以縱的報業進化的史實，來論證橫的報業改革的諸問題，讀來令人格外地覺得貼切翔實，興味濃厚。譬如「編輯之改進」一章，凡分「編輯之程序」，「標題研究」，「穿插圖景」，「版式革新」，「參考資料」等五節；說來眞是精詳入微。允其像「戰時之採訪」，「新開廣播一，「小報與小型報」等文章，都是別的同類書所未曾說及的。本書中引用了許多最新的村料，參插了不少有歷史價值的圖竟，眞可以說是後來居上，掩蓋一切同類嘗。</p>
<p>切合實際：在本書中，除掉了關於報業之歷史的追溯，景况的解析，和理論的闡揚外，最可注意的還有實際的揭示。它並不是一冊僅洪研究的書，而是一册注目於報業改進之實踐的書。其中允以「內究之充實」，「編輯之改進」，「新聞之採訪」和「戰時之採訪」諸章，所論到的種種方法，非特爲新聞記者所必須詳悉，亦目爲文藝，歷史，社会科　以及其他方面的作者，　者和　究者所應當理解的。</p>
<p>我想，一定有許多關心閱報的人，總想進一步去研　報業，以明瞭報紙之成因及其發展的罷。那末，這一册「中國近代之報業」，是最值得一讀的了，</p>
<p>最後，希望本書三版出書時，再加進「特殊性的報紙」——如兒童報，少年報，工商報，救亡報等——和「壁報」的材料，好使本書成爲吏完備的「報業大觀」。</p>
<h3>美國的WPA藝術運動（下）</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>再就演劇的地點言，塲所亦極複雜衆多，除普通的劇塲外，天幕，學校，酒館，廣塲等的被利用作演劇塲所，由各個團體自行出最低費用佈置設備。</p>
<p>統計一年中的觀衆的有千五百萬，其中三分之一，楚以實際演劇爲開始的看衆階級。</p>
<p>FTP在新劇的形式和實騐演出上，不得不說是一種演劇的新運動，他們曾嘗試過將古典劇以現代風演出，特別如「設撒」一劇用現代服裝上演，極堪注意。</p>
<p>劉易士，辛格拉「此事並非發生於此處」一劇，向來爲一般商業劇塲所拒絕，可楚通過FTA的關係，在美國二十七個都市上演，觀衆達三十萬人。此外上演名家作品尙多，此處不能一一備舉。最近並預備上演有關美國的農業政策，勞働，電力等間題的戲劇。</p>
<p>FWP及FMP的活動——關於文學方面的領域，各州根據多方面的調查，現在正在編纂報告。據已經曉得的，有詩學會和新叢書所刋行的「WPA詩人選」。</p>
<p>當然，在詩的塲合，與WPA的直接事業並無關係，這些詩人有些是WAP編輯中的「商業通俗語辭典」的編者，有的是黑人問題的顧問，或則是歷史紀錄的編纂員，以及成人教育的監督人等等。</p>
<p>至於在音樂領域方面，則根據去年刊行的「年鑑」音樂項下，謂在洛衫磯由傑克，撒姆斯德所指揮下之墨蘇格斯基的「潘立斯，哥特諾夫』等樂曲，極獲成功，此外如佛爾但和華格納的作品，也曾演奏過，例如演奏達三日之久的「西比亞尼」序曲，E長調的交響樂等，據說是獲得了希有的成功。</p>
<p>WAP藝術運動起在一九三五年，可是在這短短的四年中，這運動從單純救濟失業的運動而發展成爲美國聯邦的一個文化運動，這一而固然得歸功於政府的領導得策，以及國富的資助，但美國文化人的努力，還是這一運動成功的最大因素。</p>

<h3>雪雲</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>雪·血</p>
<p>雪褥上散撒着斑斑的　跡，今晚，捕捉着昨夜的夢，我記起這景致。</p>
<p>記憶的手更向往昔　索，揭開童年的帷帳：雪霽跟三叔到山林中去打野兔。一槍中的，鮮紅的血滴染在雪上。那情景，跟昨夜的夢境毫無二致。</p>
<p>憶念起這些，一陣悵惘像閃電般的襲上心頭，啊，寶貴的童年，你流向了那方？</p>
<p>生活在關東草原上的三叔，還安然無恙嗎？獵槍的命運又是如何？三叔已用來獵敵嗎？祖國震盪了一年多，關東呢？山林中鬬士雲集吧？</p>
<p>又是雪花飄的季節了。　雪褥上散撒着的，再不是野兔的血，而是關七的了。滋養着凍結的大地，開春會茁放出自由勝利的花蕾。</p>
<p>海·雲</p>
<p>海咆哮了，擊碎平靜的海上月。它厭棄那安分，馴順的月，海濤翻騰着，銀花碎亂，像是要沉入海底。</p>
<p>雲從不知名的遠方奔來，塞滿天空，吞蝕了月，大地是漆黑的，覆壓在洶湧的海面上。</p>
<p>夜風吹起鳥雲的哀愁，哭泣了——大雨來了。</p>
<p>天空扯着閃電，開隙的光亮，照耀出瘋在的海，浪濤像是要冲毀這世界，大地搖動了。</p>

<h3>關員熱烈愛國　海關主權完整</h3>
<p>退職關員不忍受外匯利潤　進出口關單並未改用日文本報專訪</p>
<p>中日戰事發生以來，南北各地海關，間有因華方陣地變更，陷於特殊環境，政府對於海關主權行政，頗爲關切，正規劃改進，茲誌各情如决：</p>
<p>主權行政　均仍完整</p>
<p>海關總稅務司梅樂和，對於海關一切施政，悉秉中央政府命令辦理；故各地海關，雖有以環境特殊，然主權行政，均仍完整。前此一部份關員，激於愛國熱忱，會呈請軍事委員會對於各關整飭紀綱，力求節的，經軍事委員會批復交財政部核辦，關務當局，亦以國難方殷，公務人員，允應淬勵奮發，節的救國，當即分飭所屬，切實遵辦。</p>
<p>養老金均　改購外匯</p>
<p>海關職員，例養老金儲養老金之訂定，於退職時頒給，此項數目，殊爲可觀。自巾日戰事陡起，海關方面，當將各關員月儲養老金原已購存公債者，改購外滙，一年以來，因外滙之升高，所有應領退職養老金之職員，均因購進外滙後價格上漲之原因，所領養老金，幾較戰前增加一倍。然此種外匯上之增益，純爲戰時利潤，退職關員當以此種利潤，間接即爲增加國家外滙之支出，頗多向中央陳述，以本人旣係國家一公務員，當此戰事正在進行，各省公務員旣多半折薪發給，退職關員，何忍於例外獲此外匯上之利益。聞財政部對退職關員之意見，正在調查情形，再行决定處理辦法。</p>
<p>房貼辦法　嚴禁浮報</p>
<p>海關職員例有貼房租等等各目，於月薪之外，另行支給之。向例規定，亦極嚴格，較高職員，大約爲每月五十元，惟採實報實銷制，而以五十元爲度，距今不久，會有海關一職員，以所居二十餘元之房租，混報五十元，嗣爲總稅務司所知，以其浮報，下令斥革；並通令各海關對於關員房租貼費，是吾確實，應嚴密調查，如有浮報，立予撤徵。</p>
<p>日籍關員　相當增加</p>
<p>江海關稅款，自去年七月間解送中央后，迄今未曾照解，總稅務司梅樂和業將此項情形，呈報財政部，至該關最近行政上情況，外班職員日籍者有相當增加，其原因多由於目前之應付關係。一般認為當係短時期之特殊情形，若干時期后，自可恢復原狀。至於進出口關單，近來日商方面頗有』求增用日文者，海關當局以向例報單為華英文兩種，故對此項請求，迄未加以考慮。　、（八）植物產品值國幣三百六十一萬二千九百零七元、（九）</p>
<p>土紙</p>
<p>值國幣二百二十六萬八千一百六十七元、（十）紗綫織品值國幣一千三百零一萬一千六百六十六元、（十一）化學產品值國幣二百二十六萬零八百六十元、（十二）雜貨值國幣九百七十八萬八千九百四十九元、（十三）皮類值國幣四百五十三萬四千六百八十八元、（十四）海產品值國幣一百三十八萬八千三百七十八元、</p>
<h3>哈爾濱猶太難民　供日驅使　被迫供役</h3>
<p>由中歐轉輾來華北之猶太難民、據日本保護猶太遠東會主席考福爾門稱、現由日方之把持、將所有居住於「偽滿」哈爾濱等處之猶太難民、强制迫令組織猶太人民會、帮助日人在華北經營之事宜、同與白俄反共聯盟會、作爲日方之爪牙、將供彼驅使猶太人民會、已在哈爾濱成立</p>

<h3>浙當局籌設專營局　統制甌甬兩江貨運</h3>
<p>勸導核准各輪加入公會　擇定航期以便編排次序</p>
<p>浙東之溫州寗波、爲戰後唯一之通航口岸、內地土貨之輸出、以及洋貨之輸入、均由該兩口岸轉口、浙江省政府籌設專營局統制貨運、發展運輸之效能、同時與贛閩湘各省舉辦水陸聯運、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>甬甌兩關貨物激增</p>
<p>戰後之溫州。寗波。兩口岸、因貨運出入激增、原有海關增派關員服務。稅收隨之增加、如去年溫州關進口貨值國幣一百九十二萬三千元、出口貨值國幣六百二十四萬元、寗波關進口貨值國幣一百二十一萬二千元、出口貨值國幣四百七十六萬八千元、出口貨之增加、創該兩關之新紀錄、前年寗波關出口、僅二萬六千元、溫州關出口、僅五十四萬一千元、</p>
<p>籌設專局統制貨運</p>
<p>浙江省政府鑒於溫州及寗波、已成爲內地各省貨物出入口重要口岸、以致船舶數量有限、遂呈供不應求之象、船戶仟意抬價、商民殊感痛苦、今爲調節社會經濟、疏通貨運計、已由財政廳計劃籌設專營局、統制甌甬兩江之貨運並可增加省庫收入、發展運輸之效能、</p>
<p>水陸聯運業已實行</p>
<p>浙閩續湘桂等省、業已實行水陸聯運、以上各省公路業已互通、浙贛鐵路己與粵漢鐵路接通、湘桂鐵路第一段巳完成通車、所以各省主要土貨之輸港或滬、及洋貨必需品之輸入、均由寗波溫州兩口岸轉運、第十集團軍總司令部已核准各外輸、行駛甬溫港、及甬溫滬各航錢、旨在促進內地土貨裝外倫輸出、</p>
<p>輸船公會貢獻意見</p>
<p>寗波輪船業公會、巳决定向軍警政機關請願、貢獻航行意見、請求採納、務使不妨礙抗戰軍事外、謀取人民及航商之福利、對於總司令部核准之十七航綫外輪四十八艘、其中非該公會之會員者、勸導加入、並各自擇定航行日期、以便排定進出口决序、</p>
<h3>日汽艇撞覆對江渡船</h3>

<h3>經濟部獎勵　發明電器掛綫盒</h3>

<h3>一九三八年份　工部局工業報告（續）</h3>
<p>雜項類全年指數爲一六四·二〇、較七月（一二八·八三）增百分之二七·五、逐月指數以一月爲最低（一五七·〇七）、以十月爲最高（一六九·二八）、食物類全年指數爲一二九·四七、較七月（一〇一·七二）增百分之二七·三、逐月指數以十一月爲最低（一一八·四三）、二月爲最高（一三八·三三）、衣着類全年指數爲一二六·五四、較七月（一一二·五六）增百分之一二·，四、逐月指數、六月爲最低（一一七·一八）、十一月爲最高（一三九·四五）、至於二十七年各月總指數、則以五月爲最低（一五四·四九）、八月爲最高（一六七·一二）、全年總指數、則爲一六〇·六〇、較七月（一〇九·五一）增百分之四六·七、故一般生活費用，在戰前七月、祇費一元、在二十七年、非一元四角七分不辦矣、</p>
<p>（四）（一九三八年之貨幣買力）物價與貨幣購買力、名稱雖異、實指同一問題、僅從兩方面觀察而已、物價漲、即貨幣購買力下跌、物價跌、即貨幣購買力上升、物價與貨幣購買力、二者互爲例數、此升彼降、趨向適得其反、試舉其例、如以二十六年七月總指數一〇九·五一（民十五年等於一〇〇）爲比較標準、則是月總指數與倒數應均作一〇〇計、二十七年總指數一六〇·六〇（民十五年等於一〇〇）、應作一四六·六五（民二十六年七月等於一〇〇）、其倒數爲六八·一九、六八·一九即二十七年國幣一元之購買力、換言之、二十七年國幣一元、其眞正價值、祇等於二十六年七月幣值之六角八分一厘九亳也、</p>
<p>（五）（一九三八年之零售物價令再以二十七年個別商品之零售價格、與戰前廿六年七月比較、則以房租一類、所增最鉅、平房增一倍又六成三、東洋式樓房一倍五成八、石庫門樓房一倍四成三、燃料類中、炭價增一倍一成八、廢木柴一倍、劈柴九成六、煤球七成七、食物一類、以蔬菜所增爲最烈、菠菜增二倍四成七、鹹雪菜一倍七成四、韮菜一倍四成半、靑菜一倍二成三、洋山芋一倍〇六、肉蛋所增稍遜、牛肉增九成三、鷄九成一、鮮鴨蛋六成七、豆製品中、豆腐及豆腐乾各增四成八、米麵品中、秈米增二成六、粳米一成弱、雜項一類、草紙增八成八、黃酒五成八、肥皂三成半、衣着類中、土布增三成九、條格布三成一、綫呢一成九、</p>
<p>（六）（工資率）上表各個工業、各依其自民國十九年至二十七年九年之中、每小時工資率的高下排列、二十六年及二十七年度、造船及火柴兩業的工資數字、缺而不列、八一三戰後、該兩業的工廠摧毀無遺、碩果僅存者、亦在戰區、所以無從調查、只得付諸闕如、各工業中、必造船、印刷·機器·等業、工資最高、每小時平均工資率都在一角左右、繅絲棉紡工資最低、每小時工資率不過三分四分、棉紡爲上海規模最大的製造工業、工資都是極爲微薄、</p>
<p>再依每月實際收入的高下、把各個工業同樣地排列、造船。印刷·機器·三業、仍居首位、每月收入在二三·〇八元至四七·六三元之間、繅絲及火柴工人的實際收入最低、每月在六·三一元至一一·三九元之間、收入如此低微、即在承平時期、生活的困苦可知、</p>

<h3>上海特輯我國會計學術與會計職業之回顧與前瞻（續）</h3>
<p>— 潘序偷</p>
<p>至在政府會計方而國民政府主計處設立後，勵行超然主計制度，先後訂定中央統一會計制度及頒行會計法，中央各機關與各省市政府，亦逐漸採用新式制度。各方施行成績，雖尚不乏未能盡合期望之處；但較之北政府時代，進步之多，已顧不可比擬。交通事業方面，如電政會計制度之改定，郵政會計之改良，鐵路會計之研究，亦均有重要之進展。他如中央主管機關所擬訂全國電業及公路統一會計制度等項，於促進會計上亦均有重要之作用焉。</p>
<p>同時徐永祚氏改良中式簿記之提倡，亦予我國舊式商事企業會計改良以相當之影響。民二十三年，徐永祚氏鑒於我國舊式商人之未習新式簿記者，不易將收付觀念改爲貸借觀念，慣用墨筆直寫者不易改爲鋼筆橫寫，故創議將舊式簿記加以改良，直接應用，而不主立卽改中式簿記爲西式簿記。徐氏主張，使舊式商店之欲改舊式簿記爲新式簿記者，得一捷徑，新式廠商之管理方法較舊，司理會計人員習於舊式簿記之應用者風從亦衆，成效頗著。</p>
<p>新式會；計之使用旣益普遍，會計學術之研究亦益趨精深。此十餘年來，會計譯著之內容。已不限於簿記及初級會計，凡專門會計如成本會計，高等會計學，審計學，决算表之分析，所得稅會計等已不乏佳本。且在前一期間會計編譯工作，偏重介紹，最近十年來因會計之應用巳廣，經騐已富，故學術之研究，與實務工作間之關係日益密切，會計學術，已非悉屬舶來品，所謂「中國會計學」者，已在逐漸形成之中，如雍家源氏所著中國政府會計論顧準氏所著銀行會計及拙著會計學股份有限公司會計等書均其顯例。至於本事務所同人編譯會計名辭彙譯一書，本年又有修訂本之出版，觀於我國會計名辭之統一當不乏貢獻焉。</p>

<h3>姑姪同床姦宿　丈夫報捕捉獲</h3>

<h3>鹹肉莊與小漢奸</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>常熟蔣子範先生，名元慶，幼聰慧，有神童之目，少年入洋，會為某提學選入江陰南菁書院，為高才生，經學詞章，均為人所欽佩，為人突梯滑稽，詼諧百出，故其行文，亦嬉笑怒罵，皆成文章，子範短小精悍，聲浪尖銳若婦人女子，而語言捷給，每發一語，聞者無不捧腹，人多以「快嘴丫頭」呼之。其生平最愛女色，故來滬上時，其足跡無一夕不在野雞窩中與鹹肉莊上也。其平章風月，必先裙底，三寸金蓮，方為及格，否則難美而不彰矣。嘗任上海澄衷學堂教員，（或教務長）其醉翁之意，原不在酒，而在於山水之間也。子範今年六十餘歲，其五十雙慶時，嘗自撰一聯，頗為滑稽，惜不能舉其辭矣。自八一三後，即為常熟自治會長，友人金某曾撰一聯以送之，頗得其自撰之風趣，茲錄於後，以博讀者一粲。</p>
<p>開口□□，閉口×□，拐到鹹肉莊，自稱海上大嫖客。</p>

<p>按三方格者，係吳稚暉先生口頭常有之語，想讀者當能猜知，不必舉其字矣，而此聯妙處，尤在一拐字與一挨字，因此公前年失足，不良於行也，又彼之入自治會，既非公舉，又非任命，非挨而何。</p>
<h3>檢查郵件與郵工護郵</h3>
<p>— 生</p>
<p>有一位在郵局內服務的友人某君和我閒談，因之問起日人檢查郵件和企圖接收郵局的最近發展情形，承他很詳實地告訴我好多事實。郵局的情況，外界人關切的很多，因此把他的述說寫在下面。</p>
<p>上海淪陷以後，日方援引以前我國政府的例，要求檢查郵件；雖經局長法人乍配林氏幾次折衝，終歸無效。於上年三月初旬受日方的嚴重壓迫，將上海總局各郵件部門於愚園路之臨時局址遷回北四川路原址，不出一禮拜，日人就到郵局派駐檢查員。派來的檢查員一共二十一名，分配在封發，投遞，刷印，掛號，快信，外洋幾個部門，實施他們的工作。二十一人的分佈情形，並不十分固定，時常在各間輪流調換著。工作時間從上午九時到下午五時，中間有兩點鍾回到虹口去吃飯，也不永駐在郵局內。</p>
<p>對於出口郵件，凡是寄往內地的官衙，公園，機關，報館去的信，十九皆被檢扣，私人間的信函因為不及一一檢查，所以很少扣留。至於報紙刊物，檢扣得最多，尤其是寄往游擊隊區的各種日報，很少能寄出的。甚至已經封好了袋，預備運出時，還要拆開了全部扣住。寄往外國的信因為曾經英美領事的抗議，全不拆查，惟印刷物品還是逃不了他們的注意。密勒氏評論報大陸報等最是注意，沒有一次能夠漏網，後來他們不得不另想別的寄遞方法，不再經過郵局的手。</p>
<p>進口信件特別注意於外洋來的，每當外郵到時，三四個檢查員在旁監視著，一邊開袋一邊拆看，很注意地檢視著，所有正義的書報，全難倖免，還有一個檢查員專門負責檢視日本人自己的信件，當日本郵件來時，他就獨自忙過不止，身邊帶著一份名單，寫著日本左異份子的姓氏，作為檢查時的參考。上海發到日本的信函，也由他細心地翻閱過，可見日本內部編制的嚴厲。</p>
<p>除了檢查郵件以外，他們再擔負著偵察和監視局中員工的思想和行動。引誘意志薄弱的份子，調查內部的辦事手續，做一切攘奪郵局全部行政的開路工作。因為這種特殊工作他們的態度特別和氣，有時向你討教幾個中國字的讀法，或是勸誘你去讀日本文，甚至歪曲地同你來討論思想問題。可是郵局全體員工很知道這「彬彬有禮」的外貌下隱藏無比的陰險，對他們衹是敷衍，靜默和冷淡，而靜默冷淡真是表示他們的無聲的憤怒。而敷衍顯露他們無可奈何的苦衷。雖有極少數的敗類趁機向日人搭訕和學習日語，最後也逃不了同事的鄙棄和制裁。</p>
<p>聽了上面一段話，覺得很是悲愴，郵局雖尚保持行政完整，同海關一樣，大半已受日本人的控制。後來某君講到郵局員工護郵的堅決，不覺對郵工深深地表示敬佩。去年十一月四日，江海關開始飄揚了五色偽旗，據說是紀念偽「政府」的成立，當時郵局也受到同樣壓迫，完全依賴郵局上級人員應付的得當，同全體郵工態度的堅決，得保持了貞潔。十一月十日為偽「政府」預定接收郵局的日期。郵工會表示：「你們來接收，至多給你一座空的房子」。日偽方面鑒于郵政員工過去的光榮鬥爭歷史，和錯綜複雜的國際關係，終於死了他們的心，以後對於郵局的陰謀，當然是層出不窮的。所以全體員工更加團結在工會領導之下，誓死維護郵權的完整。</p>
<h3>「銀翼春秋」</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Men　With　Wings”</p>
<p>派拉蒙出品　南京大戲院映</p>
<p>最近二個月中，我們看到了三張航空片，「鐵翼九霄」，「冰天長征」及這張「銀翼春秋」。同時，也很湊巧，這三部作品有一個相同之點，就是兩位情逾骨肉的朋友，和一位女角構成的一個三角戀愛的故事。</p>
<p>恕我沒有讀過一本關於飛機在這三十年中發展的史冊，而「銀翼春秋」據說就是把這三十年來飛機的進展史，從雷鐵昆仲的製造飛機說起，經過歐洲大戰時期的劇烈空戰，一直到現在，寰飛全世界的郵航飛機為止，在短短的一百分鍾中，導演威利威爾門所介紹到我們眼前來的「銀翼春秋」，在年代上，或是敘述上，和飛機進展史的錯異如何，我就沒有寫一萬字，或八千字來加以考正的能力，這是非常抱歉而遺憾的。</p>
<p>因為「銀翼春秋」從一九〇三年美國雷鐵兄弟Wright　Brothers駕駛他們創製的飛機，作初次飛行測騐開始，一直到一九三八年新式轟炸機試騐成功，在這悠長的三十年中，更貫以派特，施高特和碧姬的三角戀愛，整個戲的進展不免有枯澀之感了。</p>
<p>片的開始，寫幼年時代的碧姬，派特及施高特的一段戲卻是非常活潑的。如他們飛放雛形飛機時的大真爛漫；藍森的飛機試騐成功，不料於初次試飛的時候，就不幸墮地，在飛機燃燒之後，寫碧姬呆呆坐著，派特和施高特的久久無言，偷偷一吻而別，把孩童的心理描寫得很透徹。</p>
<p>一九一四年後，故事就縱的發展下來，對於他們三人之間的關係，僅僅在那三場戰中給予觀眾一個很深的印象，就是大戰告終以後，派特和碧姬已產一女，派拉突然赴摩洛哥參戰，施高特去慰問她的時候，碧姬抱著孩子，問「他到那里去了」？「摩洛哥」施高特回答，碧姬緩緩地從樓梯上下來，哭了起來；派特回來時，及最後施高特報告派拉死訊時，導演用著同樣的鏡頭，這無論在畫面的章法上，及氣氛的把握上，這三場戲是非常精彩的。</p>
<p>這是部五彩片，在飛機升空的時候，導演似乎特別注意到褪色的和諧，如幾次飛行表演，及空戰，都是非常美麗。</p>
<h3>「火燭小心」</h3>
<p>— 東郭</p>
<p>「篤篤……篤篤」</p>
<p>是敲著竹管的聲音，在靜寂的夜空中，給朝我屋子括著的風捲了過來，聲音是那麼微弱的，漸漸地，才沉重起來啦！</p>
<p>「篤篤……火燭小心……篤篤……前門關關……」　　每年，當我聽到這聲音的時候，我便會那麼想：——這世界是冷酷的，比十二月的風還要來得殘忍：人與人之間，充滿了自私自利。這樣，我便感到了呌「火燭小心」者的偉大，他——雖說為了一些可憐的酬報，他卻有著別人所沒有的熱情，在寒冷的夜空下，沒有人督促，自家兒在各條里弄中繞圈的敲著，呌著，一遍復一遍地，到天空吐露了曙光。他給我們留心是否有燎原的星星之火，他也給我們趕走了掘後門的小偷。</p>
<p>「篤篤……後門撐撐……篤篤……寒冬臘月……」聲音又微弱了，該是去遠了吧！</p>
<p>是的，我對呌「火燭小心」者是很敬佩而又同情的，我會為他而感傷得幾乎落下淚來。那是我第一次看到他衰老的容貌，在一個白天，他在挨戶要著些微的酬報的時候，我看見他的頭髮已經十分蒼白了，眼皮掛著，分不出眸子的黑白來，他的背早已齊腰彎曲得平平了：掮著一支竹管，提著一盞火字顛倒寫的燈籠，哆嗦著，眼淚不斷地淌到牙鬚上。</p>
<p>「篤篤……先生」！</p>
<p>人們不耐煩地給了他二個銅子，他感激涕零地走了。</p>
<p>「他呌火燭小心已經有二三十年了，我最早看他時，他還年青哩！現在，看他的樣子，恐怕不久於人世了吧」！有人對我說。</p>
<p>二三十年，這是多麼長的一個徒刑啊！從年青到衰老，他的生活該是長滿了痛苦與不幸。是的，我也相信他不久是會死的，而且一定死得很悽慘，也許連屍骨都沒有人收殮。人類，永遠是那麼殘酷呵！</p>
<p>然而，我記得很清楚，他在八一三之前的一個冬天，他還活著，他依舊呌著「火燭小心」的。可是現在他在何處呢？給砲火炸成泥漿？給逃難羣在腳底下稀爛？直直地餓死在破屋里？……一個悲慘的老者屍影浮現在我的腦海上，我不能往下想了。</p>
<p>「篤篤……篤篤……」聲音又近了。</p>
<p>他就是那個老者嗎？不！他是另外一個老者，我記得起的，他也是一個苦老頭子。「篤……火燭小心……咳咳」</p>
<p>聽到透不過氣來的咳嗽聲，我知道他正在和兇猛的北風在掙扎，而我仿佛看到了他走上與前一個老者一樣地走上了死滅的道路。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第二回　林工師妙解標準化　金導員高談平等觀</p>
<p>林建成道：「講到小賬那件事，正是一種亞風，為什麼正賬之外，還要小賬呢？」據老輩的人講：中國從前曾經厲行新生活，要廢除那種小賬，怎樣也廢除不掉。加一小賬之外，還有額外小賬，甚而至於小賬過於正賬的。這也不但是中國，外國也是如此。這其間，英國比較好點，最厲害是法國，動一動就要小賬。尤其娛樂飲食之所，你要是不給他們小賬，他們面孔就兩樣了。因此人家稱它為「小帳國」。其實老實一句話，小賬就是「公開的賄賂」，我們現在做到廢除小賬制度，真也不容易呀。金澹雲道：「這那從階級制度中來，無可避免的什麼呌做小帳，以前稱之為賞錢，就是你伺應得我周到，大爺賞給你幾個錢。後來變成非此不可，一定要的小賬，而窮者益窮，富者益富，窮人便向富人丐其餘瀝，富人便對窮人買其歡心，這樣小賬便形成了。所以當時中國曾一度要廢除小賬，我說是不揣本而齊其末。」譬如一個階級制度高峻的社會，要它平等，是不容易的。我也聽到一位老先生講過：中國在前清時代，僕人們對於他的主人，稱呼大人老爺。革命以後，便不許再作此稱了，改稱為先生。然而稱為先生，便怎麼樣了呢？主僕依然是主僕呀！尤其是我們女界中，婢妾倡妓，依然是風行呀！說什麼平等，改改稱呼，就算是平等嗎？所以你說廢除小賬制度不容易，我說是極其容易。只要人人知道平等，人人知道拿小賬是可恥，人人知道除我應當所取之外，不必再要小賬，那小賬自然不廢而自廢了。世界上的各種事，是世界上的各種人分擔的，本不應分出那種是貴業，那種是賤役。現在我們新中國，正要向那一條路，努力做去。就像我這位汪靜妹妹，她在這裏當女侍者，她難道失去她的人格嗎？她難道使我們失去敬仰嗎？她笑著道：「澹雲姊！你又在講我了，我聽得的，什麼汪靜妹妹，……」林建成道：「她倒不是講你，她在這裏大發高論，可惜你來遲了，不然，倒有一場演說可聽咧。」（二三）</p>

<h3>抗戰新聞片　游擊隊之母　趙老太太上銀幕</h3>
<p>馴子為國努力聲淚俱下　令郎趙侗亦有一番演詞</p>
<p>「游擊隊之母」趙老太太，是華北游擊隊領袖趙侗先生的令堂，人家稱她是我們中華民族的母親。她老人家在華北領導數十萬健兒，發動游擊戰術，進入敵人的後方，施以避實攻虛的突擊。早曾建下不少功績，當使敵人們為之聞風喪膽。</p>
<p>她雖是位年近古稀的老人，但似那樣勇敢，堅强的奮鬥精神，卻未見讓於青年的人們。不久以前，她和趙侗先生先後都從華北，到了香港，是都負有重大使命的。最近，趙太太在港事畢，又上星加坡一帶，去進行宣傳工作。趙侗先生也將於這幾天內，返回前綫，指揮華北健兒們作戰。上月二十四號，在她乘輪出發之前，中央攝影場駐港代表李公恪先生，為此除在輪船碼頭拍攝趙老太太離港去星的新聞實景外，事先並假南粵攝影場，邀請她們母子到場，拍攝幾節訓子的聲片。當下先攝趙老太太與趙侗先生並立一處的中景。趙老太太這樣對他說：「我現在要到星加坡去向僑胞作宣傳，你回到前方去的時候，你更要去爭取我們抗戰的勝利，我們要堅持抗戰到底的精神，不要中途頹廢。你放膽的去努力，不要顧及父母，你有孝敬父母的真心，你就去孝敬國家。孝敬國家就是孝敬父母。現在我要去了！你得好好的努力。你如果不好好孝敬國家，不能盡你的責任，你就不是我的兒子，我就不算是你的母親。」當時說末後幾句，更是聲容慘切，不禁淚如雨下。使得在場參觀的人們，也都大為感動，大家忍不住流下淚來。</p>
<p>接著拍了趙太太一個特寫鏡頭之後，續攝趙侗先生對他母親的一段答話：「母親你放心好了，兒子決不會忘記你的教訓，兒子決本已往的精神，去殺敵人，殺盡在我們國土上的敵人，打回老家去。絕對抗戰到底，擁護我們最高的領袖，爭取我們中華民國的獨立，自由與幸福。」</p>
<p>末了，又拍趙侗先生關於游擊隊的一段演詞，大要是說：「游擊隊是給敵人在佔領區域內不能得到安息，分散他們的兵力，使敵人疲於奔命，給正規軍以相當的助力。同時，希望華南的游擊隊和華北游擊隊能互通消息，發揮更大的效能，早日殺盡敵人這。」</p>
<p>這片子長度共攝五百多尺，準備將以新聞片方式，供給內地各影院放映。使得崇仰趙老太太和趙先生的同胞，在銀幕上可以瞻仰他們的丰采，聆他們的愛國演詞。這樣，在抗戰宣傳方面，它所發生的效力，顯然大不尋常；只是我們這些困處孤島的羣眾，為此想望心切，暫時間卻還沒有看到這片子的機會。</p>

<h3>記上海銀行同人京劇社</h3>
<p>— 慤厂</p>
<p>上星期五，得到朋友的介紹，在仁記路一九〇號大樓，內樓七十五號「上海銀行同人京劇社」作了一次訪問，特把他記出來：該社是民國十八年成立的，銀行當局，因為這是公餘之暇，職員們應有的</p>
<p>正當娛樂　所以肯極力提倡，并且按月撥給津貼，該社在經濟上既不感覺困難，辦事當然比較順手，成就斐然可觀了。一二八以後，市面日見蕭條，該社就無形解放。到了前年的二月，他們覺得社會經濟已經復興，百事業已向榮，同人業餘，仍有調整疲勞的必要，又向當局請求重張旗鼓。復興後，衹唱了兩次堂會，一次彩排，而七七事變的噩耗，就傳到滬濱了。該社也就因此而暫時停止。如今上海已在特殊環境下蒸蒸向榮，該社同人在苦悶之餘，乃又商得當局的同意，在去年十二月一日將該社</p>
<p>重新組織　起來，現在的會員共有五六十位，他們志願是想成功一個完全票友的班底。所有主配角龍套場面，全由會員們自己擔任，不假手內行。該社的教師已有三位，他們還想再物色兩位教武把子和教丑的教師。每天的下午五時到七時是他們排練弔嗓學戲的時間，每星期的一三五是</p>
<p>實行響排　的日子。他們的響排是由戲務股研究每個會員已學的程度，來排定次序，要使每個人全有響排的機會。這樣的辦法，對於初學的人，是很有幫助的。現在除了打鼓老和琴師，還是用的內行，可是其他的響器，已竟全由會員們打起來了。學場面的人很多，學胡琴的也有一兩位。就是小配角（掃邊老生等）跑龍套的學者，也並不因為那是小角色，而不肯去學。最近他們又將原有的房屋稍加改建，添搭</p>
<p>一座戲臺裝了幾盞回光燈。除去例定的響排，練身段全要在臺上去實習外，並且還打算每一個月或兩個月舉行小彩排一次。這種設備，在上海各票房裏還是初見呢！我寫此文，並不是替他們宣傳。我的　機是這樣的：（一）該社是得到行方當局的提倡，足見當局對於職員們業餘消遣的重視，而始予同人們一些安慰，是值得讚美的；（二）該社的組織很健全，設置非常完備，與別的票房情形絕對不同；（三）該社的志愿，非常偉大，本來跑龍套小配角，場面，全是藝術之一，原不應因為不能出風頭，就不加以重視。該社肯在這些小地方上下功夫，將來如能成功確可算是該社的榮譽，票界的佳話了。</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session Establish Supreme National Defense Conference Committee; Six Members, President Chiang to Concurrently Serve as Chairman; Frontier Department to Manage Defense Affairs in Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Fifth Plenary Session held a preparatory meeting on the 21st, officially convened on the 22nd, and concluded on the 25th. Discussions were held on adjusting national defense organizations. A Supreme National Defense Conference Committee will be established, with a more substantial organization than the existing National Defense Council. Chiang will concurrently serve as chairman, with six members, including two leading figures from the party and government and two esteemed non-affiliated figures. The list of candidates has been internally determined. In addition, a Frontier Department is planned to manage defense, military, economic, and transportation affairs in Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Kangding provinces. However, it is yet to be determined whether the department will be subordinate to the Military Affairs Commission or the Executive Yuan. (Special dispatch, 11:00 PM on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today is the second day of the Fifth Plenary Session, dedicated to hearing reports on military, political, diplomatic, and party affairs. All resolutions of the session, major ones, will be announced after the conclusion. Reuters has learned from responsible sources that the spirit of this conference differs from previous Kuomintang conferences. Chairman Chiang advocated that the following three points should be observed during the session: (1) All reports should emphasize facts; (2) Representatives can ask questions on any issue; (3) All questions asked must be answered sincerely by the responsible authorities. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>President Chiang's Address at the Fifth Plenary Session: Using Facts to Prove Victory in the War of Resistance is Inevitable</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) After understanding the various examples of enemy self-inflicted failures and self-made sins that I have listed above, comrades, you can understand that in this Sino-Japanese War, if Japan can achieve victory, then all strategies, tactics, and all military theories in the world will have to be fundamentally overturned, and even the principles and theories of all things can be proven useless. After understanding the significance of the enemy's various means of coercion and inducement to surrender today, comrades, you can even more clearly understand what we should strive to uphold. To put it plainly, it is to be determined, unyielding, that is to say, our spirit must absolutely not be coerced by the enemy, and we must absolutely not be deceived by the enemy. We must persist in resisting the war and fighting to the end, not only to prevent the enemy from achieving their past goal of "quick victory," but also to shatter their current cunning plan of "quick peace." This is our only strategy today. This is the foundation for the enemy's defeat and our country's victory. I solemnly tell you, comrades, this is the conclusion I have drawn from deep contemplation over the past eighteen months, in my position as commander-in-chief entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the nation's safety and security, and I specially offer it to all comrades of our plenary session. All of you comrades should further make the entire nation understand that we must today take the history of the Song and Ming dynasties as a cautionary tale. We must know that the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties was not because the enemy foreign tribes had any superior strength, but entirely due to the wavering and timidity of the will and spirit of a small number of generals and officials and the social elite of the time, and even the people of the whole country were affected by them, leading to the failure of the overall situation, which could not be remedied. Today, we have such a good national spirit, such a profound revolutionary foundation, and our party's Three Principles of the People, which are suitable for the times. As long as we do not abandon ourselves, no force can destroy our country. Today's situation is very clear. What is placed before us is that the enemy will inevitably rely on their weapons and military force to make a more ferocious, desperate struggle. Our policy, however, is very simple and clear. From the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, we must use our revolutionary strategies and tactics to fundamentally strike the enemy's shaken will and exhausted strength with a more courageous and resolute resistance, quickly promote the enemy's total collapse and final defeat, and complete our revolutionary mission. I will tell our comrades one more thing: if we currently harbor delusions of compromise and seek a lucky peace, it is tantamount to throwing ourselves into a trap and seeking our own destruction. It must be known that the so-called talk of adjusting diplomatic relations published by former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe on the 22nd of last month is actually a document of inducement to surrender, not a condition for peace. If we talk about peace based on this, to be honest, it is surrender. The Chinese nation has ambition, integrity, and a future. After a year and a half of resistance, although the sacrifices are great, our strength is becoming stronger as we fight. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor of the Chinese nation, in order to be worthy of our ancestors and parents, worthy of future generations, worthy of ourselves, and worthy of the countless martyrs who sacrificed for the War of Resistance, will never willingly surrender. Today, we can only fight with all our strength, resisting the war with a heart of certain death, until the day we achieve our goal. It must be known that surrendering is seeking death in life, with no hope of survival. Fighting is seeking life in death, and there is a way to certain victory. Now, I will again conduct a self-examination of our China's War of Resistance. I can say that not only does the enemy have a way to certain defeat, but our country has a reason to certain victory. Sun Tzu said, "First make yourself invincible, then wait for the enemy to be vulnerable." To achieve invincibility, of course, requires us to shed blood and sweat to work hard and struggle. However, from the aspects of history, geography, culture, economy, and national spirit, and based on past facts, we have, in our innate conditions, a foundation that makes the enemy inevitably invincible. As long as we combine it with our man-made efforts, we can certainly defeat the enemy without any doubt. (A) In terms of history, I have said that the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties was the defeat of a dynasty of a single family name, not the destruction of our Chinese nation. Our Chinese nation has never been conquered by anyone in five thousand years. Not only has it not been destroyed by anyone, but the collapse of the Song and Ming dynasties at that time was only due to a very small number of generals and officials who lacked courage and integrity, only knew personal security and ease, and were selfish and self-interested without regard for the nation's misfortune, resulting in the entire collapse of centuries of dynasty. However, that was an era of autocratic monarchy, and the court and the people were separated, so the pain was not very concerned, and the people's resistance could not be exerted for a while. In fact, the spirit of the entire nation at that time was not controlled by foreign tribes, and it always resisted foreign invaders to the end. After the national awakening became widespread, even after two or three hundred years, it was finally able to expel the barbarians and restore the rivers and mountains. What's more, now is the era of the Republic of China, which is based on the people. The current National Government is a revolutionary government, which is also the National Government. A revolutionary government must fight for the interests of the nation, and it also exists for the interests of the people. It recognizes its own responsibilities and cannot be threatened by others. It wants to complete the national revolution, implement the Three Principles of the People, and is absolutely not afraid of military aggression. Our War of Resistance today is a unified action in which the will, spirit, and strength of the government and the people are closely integrated. As Sun Tzu said, "The Way is to make the people agree with the ruler, so they can die with him, they can live with him, and the people are not afraid of danger." This is the first major principle of victory in war. Our war of resistance against Japan can indeed achieve this principle. Our whole country is of one heart, and everyone is united. Under the command of the National Government, the old, the weak, women, and children all know how to kill the enemy and defend themselves, and they all listen to the command and control. It is truly the so-called "dying without regret," and no one is willing to sell the lives of their ancestors to be a traitor. The so-called "can be killed but not humiliated" spirit of our country for thousands of years has been widely awakened by the enemy's bestiality. Therefore, in terms of history, China will never be destroyed. Looking at the past history, and measuring it with today's national consciousness and the spirit of the times, this war of resistance is even more impossible for China to be defeated and conquered.</p>
<p>(B) In terms of geography, our country has a natural position to defend against foreign aggression. The construction of the Great Wall in the past was a great project in which our people used the terrain as a defense against the enemy. Our country has a vast area, with a longitude spanning more than sixty-five degrees from east to west. From south to north, it has a climate of cold, temperate, and tropical zones. Therefore, our country's military success or failure is discussed in terms of both the timing of the heavens and the advantages of the earth, and both the inland and western lakes are vertical and horizontal, and mountains are staggered, plains and deserts, everything is available. Therefore, in terms of area, in the past, no matter which foreign tribe, they could only occupy a part of us for a period of time, but could not permanently occupy all of us. Even in the era when the Yuan and Qing forces were at their strongest, they could only occupy a few strongholds, and our people's resistance still existed and spread throughout the country. Today, the enemy only has a population of seventy million, and they want to swallow our country, which has a vast population more than six times larger than them, and they want to eliminate our nation, which has a long history. Isn't this a dream? As for the current war situation, our country has a complex terrain, as mentioned in the previous section. Coupled with the strong national spirit, and the enemy whose input and weapons are exhausted in use, then geographically speaking, our country will certainly not be conquered by the enemy.</p>
<p>(C) In terms of culture, since the beginning of history, only China in Asian countries has an independent culture, and only China has used culture to nurture foreign tribes, and even assimilated them. No foreign culture has been able to eliminate our country's inherent culture. As for modern science, it is a shared civilization result of the world. However, Chinese culture naturally has its unique spirit. There is no need to quote extensively, just look at the remote people in the mainland of our country now, countless men and women who encounter the enemy, often have loyal and righteous acts worthy of singing and weeping, which shows the deep foundation of the power of Chinese culture. If the enemy wants to eliminate our national spirit with a culture that is neither East nor West, they have already suffered a lot of failures in many occupied areas. As long as we are united and determined to fight, the longer the war of resistance, the more our national righteousness will be promoted, and during the war of resistance, we will forge a bright and practical force in our cultural history. Therefore, in terms of culture and national spirit, China will never be destroyed by the enemy.</p>
<p>(D) In terms of economy, the cause of war now often lies in economic plunder, and success or failure often depends on the ability of the economy to be sustained. Our country is an agricultural country and is in the process of construction. It was originally a worrying crisis when it was suddenly subjected to violent aggression. However, in the eighteen months from the beginning of the war to the present, not only has our financial foundation not been significantly affected, but our finance has always been stable, and the lives of the people in the rear have not been affected by the war. Moreover, most provinces have shown a surplus phenomenon due to last year's bumper harvest and consumption festivals. This is because we are an agricultural country and have strong endurance, unlike industrial countries, which are easily affected by war. Now that we have entered the second phase of the war of resistance, we firmly believe that there will be no problem with the wartime economy. In the southwestern and northwestern provinces, which are the base of our war of resistance, we are actively developing national defense industries, small and medium-sized industries, and mineral and forestry resources. The technical talents and capital of the whole country are concentrated to do it, which will definitely enable the national economic construction to establish a permanent foundation, and there is no need to worry about the lack of military and people's livelihood. The tenacity of the wartime economic endurance of our agricultural country is another point that the enemy has not considered, and it is also one of the enemy's biggest failures. Therefore, in terms of economy, China is sufficient to resist the war for a long time and will not be subdued by the enemy.</p>
<p>Modern warfare not only requires knowing the enemy and yourself, but also knowing the direction of international situation development. The enemy not only does not know himself, does not know the enemy, and simply does not know us Chinese, so the era environment must inevitably tend to failure step by step. In the past year, the international situation, in general, although the surface is turbulent and uneasy, the latent mainstream is always moving in the direction of maintaining faith and peace. Especially the democratic powers in Europe and the United States are very careful in dealing with the changing situation. On the part of the people, rejecting aggression and advocating justice are becoming more and more powerful every day. Even their politicians are painstakingly trying to stabilize the existing situation while also never relaxing the preparation for enriching their own strength. From various aspects, we can see that they have the determination to curb aggression and maintain world peace. Recently, this situation has become more and more obvious. Since the September 18th Incident, we have long determined that the only path in the world is the path of public reason and justice, which is the path that all mankind should follow. All countries that can be self-reliant and self-reliant, even if they are temporarily in hardship and sacrifice, are justified. Over time, they will naturally get the resonance of justice. The recent signs of international evolution corroborate our observations over the past six or seven years, and there is no error at all. This is not because we have any ability to foresee, we just adhere to the position of Mr. Sun Yat-Sen of saving the country. Therefore, everything is based on conscience and justice. Comrades must understand that Mr. Sun Yat-Sen spent his entire life in revolution to save China, which is also to save the world. Our unyielding national policy of resisting the war is to follow this practical teaching, which is what revolutionary believers of the Three Principles of the People should unanimously and resolutely adhere to. Mr. Sun Yat-Sen once said that after China restores its national status, it will also bear a great responsibility to the world. In his nationalism and various teachings, Mr. Sun Yat-Sen also repeatedly instructed that China is the pillar of East Asia, and the great nation of Asia. When China is strong, the surrounding nations are peaceful and sincerely return to us, and the nations surrounding our country can maintain independence and live in harmony. Mr. Sun Yat-Sen further pointed out from historical facts, "We have never used economic power to oppress other nations... China's peaceful thought was already very sufficient in the Han Dynasty." We do not insult the lonely and weak, we are not afraid of the strong, we talk about mutual assistance, we seek self-reliance, we advocate faith, and we oppose aggression. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-Sen said, "China has been strong for thousands of years, and Korea still exists. Japan has only been strong for twenty years, and it has destroyed Korea." This is because China has always taken helping the weak and supporting the declining as its policy, and self-preservation and coexistence as its ultimate goal. Our national revolution is to promote our morality of faith and peace, and to promote the common and permanent peace and happiness of the world.</p>
<p>At the time when the European war ended, Mr. Sun Yat-Sen drafted a plan for national construction, the purpose of which was to promote the modernization of China's industry, and also to find an excellent outlet for capital and technology, so as to prevent the world from suffering the tragic wars due to the competition for resources and markets. The most important sentence in the middle is to use the principle of "survival by controlling ourselves" to use foreign capital and machinery. Unfortunately, this compassionate idea of saving the country and the world has not been concretely realized. On the contrary, Japan took advantage of the opportunity after the European War to invade our country step by step. Since the September 18th Incident, our country has always been wronged and endured pain, respecting peace, and the enemy continues to expand its aggression without limit. He does not know at all that now is the era of "national self-determination" and the surging tide of "nationalism." Small nations still demand to rise and independence, and the world powers have also changed their past attitudes and methods. In such an era, our enemy still delusionally wants to swallow China with a country of 70 million people and 450 million people. After the Tanggu Agreement, the establishment and survival of our country has reached the lowest limit. At this point, Japan still wants to destroy the only lifeline for China's life, and provoke trouble for no reason, occupying our Beijing and Tianjin. Even this lowest limit is not allowed to be preserved, then it is better to die than to live, and better to perish than to exist. To exist together is to perish, so we can only fight desperately. The ancient saying says, "When two armies meet, the mourner wins." At that time, there was no reason for us not to resist. Our morale and people's hearts were completely sad and indignant, with death and nothing else. This is an "army of mourning" that has never existed in the history of the world, and our war of resistance is not only to defend the independence and survival of our country, but also to maintain world peace and international faith. Therefore, this battle of ours is also a fair and just "righteous battle," and the enemy's unprovoked aggression against China is a "violent battle" of suicide and self-mutilation that has no name.</p>
<p>When we started the war of resistance, we had already calculated all the hardships and difficulties of today, and even the hardships and difficulties that would be deepened ten times or a hundred times compared to today. However, since this sacred duty has been added to the shoulders of our nation, we must overcome all difficulties and achieve the task of our national revolution with supreme sacrifice. We must attack aggression, restore the effectiveness of international articles, extend international justice, and use our resolute resistance to prove the inevitable defeat of the tyranny of violence, change the vision and hearing of the entire human race in the world, and permanently maintain international peace. Comrades must know that before the war of resistance, the world regarded our country as inferior to a third-class country. Now we are fighting with Japan, a first-class power, for more than a year and a half, and we have not been defeated by the enemy. We certainly no longer need to fear the enemy's violence. Our future is still inevitably full of difficulties, but after the war of resistance has entered the second stage, we are convinced that the war situation will inevitably be smooth day by day, and closer and closer to the light. The question is whether we have the spirit of unyielding, long-term persistence, and whether we have the effort to unite the country and fight more and more vigorously.</p>
<p>Based on the above description, all comrades can truly recognize the strength of our country to support the struggle, recognize the strategic policies of the enemy country, and recognize the various actual situations and the process of evolution in other aspects. From this, you can understand the inevitability of the development of all things in the world, and you can clearly understand the number of successes and failures. Since ancient times, great courage comes from great wisdom. Since we have such an unshakeable righteous perception of the mission and future of the war of resistance, we will naturally generate incomparable determination and confidence. Now our war of resistance has already entered the second stage. Undeniably, we have lost a lot of land and most of the transportation money, sacrificed the lives and property of many compatriots, and seized countless industries and resources. However, we must know that most revolutionary work starts from scratch. From now on, we must use the existing land, manpower, military power, and financial resources as a plan, and restore the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs before the Tongmenghui who raised the banner of uprising against foreign rule without an inch of iron in their hands and without any credentials. From small places, low places, and extremely difficult places, we must be down-to-earth and set a specific action plan and plan. After the plan is set, we must do our best to do it, and every word and sentence must be implemented. The enemy declares that "the war will be a hundred years." We believe that the work of resisting the war and building the country has no time limit. If it does not succeed in five years, then it will be ten years, and if it does not succeed in ten years, then it will be a hundred years. We will not stop for a day until the goal is achieved. How should we work hard? We must work hard to target the enemy's situation. Today's enemy is just like what Sun Tzu said, "The great officials are angry and do not obey, they are afraid of the enemy and fight on their own, and the general does not know his ability, which is called collapse." When we know this, we must use our unity to deal with the enemy's arrogance and chaos, and the defeat of the following. We know that during the war, the enemy's industry is stagnant, and the economic flaws are becoming more and more obvious. We must give play to the characteristics of our agricultural country, endure hardship, and support ourselves to deepen the weaknesses of the enemy's industrial country. We know that the enemy's desire is to fundamentally destroy the economic foundation of our nation. We must step up the construction of all our wartime, and cultivate the power of long-term resistance, so as to promote the crisis of the collapse of the enemy's society. We know that since last year, the enemy country has suffered from natural disasters, wind disasters, floods, and continuous major earthquakes, which have caused the people who were forced to fight in the country to suffer more pain and loss. We should take advantage of our favorable weather and geographical advantages to step up agricultural production to fight against the shortcomings of the island country that cannot end natural disasters. We know that the enemy people are suffering more and more, the enemy government is ineffective, and his opposition to the war between the government and the public is becoming stronger day by day. We must truly practice our Three Principles of the People to attack the enemy's militarism that harms the people and harms people's own self. In short, we today</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang's Admonition and the People</h3>
<p>Generalissimo Chiang recently attended the opening of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and delivered an admonitory speech. The full text was published in the newspapers yesterday and today. It embodies utmost sincerity and fervent emotion, expounds profound and subtle principles, analyzes reality, and points the way forward. It promotes the righteous spirit of resisting tyranny and is filled with the vital energy of the nation. Truly, literature conveys the Way; the Way of China's resistance and nation-building is contained within it. It is a document that will be passed down through the ages and a model for the nation to emulate. Comparing it to Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma's inaugural declaration and parliamentary address, in terms of sincerity and falsehood, reality and emptiness, right and wrong, truth and doubt, strength and weakness, courage and cowardice, wisdom and foolishness, greatness and pettiness, resourcefulness and incompetence, in any aspect, it is clear that China is superior to Japan. It is clear that China has a leader and culture, while Japan has no statesman and no soul. This is a clear sign that China will surely win and Japan will surely lose. Generalissimo Chiang's words are spoken from the position of a commander-in-chief entrusted with the nation's safety. Opening the door to clearly defined responsibility, it will not only be believed and obeyed by those within and without, but also serve as a guiding principle for the thoughts, words, and actions of China's military, civilians, party, and government personnel.</p>
<p>China's military, political, and party affairs are guided and orchestrated by a brilliant and wise leader at the top. The people are happy to exert their utmost efforts, responding to the times and offering suggestions based on events, which goes without saying. Considering the people's perspective: encountering such difficulties, with such a bright and promising future, how can the people contribute to the resistance and nation-building? How can they live up to the leader's earnest teachings? And how can they not be ashamed to be the people of this time of resistance and nation-building, not be ashamed to be the people led by a brilliant and wise leader? Today is a great era, continuing the past and opening up the future. How should the Chinese people of today contribute to their nation, so that future generations, thousands of years from now, will proudly say that their ancestors had a loyal and patriotic heart in the glorious and brilliant history of the revival?</p>
<p>Since the nation is in a time of extraordinary hardship, the people should bear extraordinary responsibilities. This is certainly true. Examining the reality and distinguishing its nature, it is also extremely ordinary. Because it is ordinary, it is what everyone should do and what everyone can overcome. Some may feel that their abilities are not enough to fulfill the ordinary, or lament that the war has deprived them of their ordinary abilities. Can this be believed? It is either thoughtlessness or deception. Let us examine the general phenomena of the nineteen months of resistance: those who have suffered the calamity of burning, killing, raping, and looting, and have experienced the hardships of displacement, are most deserving of sympathy. The old have lost their children, the young have lost their guardians, their homes have been destroyed, and they are suffering from hunger and cold. If these people are not given relief, they will fill the ditches. The responsibility for relief lies with society and the government. According to a recent estimate report from a missionary, there are nearly thirty million people in need of relief. This is indeed a huge number, but compared to the total population of the country, it is only six or seven percent. If six or seven percent are in need of relief and one percent are risking their lives on the battlefield, there are still ninety-two or three percent of the people who should bear ordinary responsibilities in this extraordinary time. If they exert their utmost efforts, what cannot be accomplished? What success cannot be achieved?</p>
<p>What are the people's responsibilities in this extraordinary time? In terms of daily personal life, there are only two things: minimizing consumption and diligently increasing production. This is what the nation's strength depends on. Minimizing consumption and increasing production are the ways to strengthen the foundation. In terms of general social life, the key is sincerity and love, reflecting on oneself as a member of the public, not being a burden to the public, and fulfilling one's duties as a member. Serve the public, serve those who are less capable than oneself in intellect, wealth, or physical strength. In cities and towns, there are needs and deficiencies. In rural areas, there are needs and deficiencies. Observe the needs and deficiencies, do not be stingy with what is private, and do your best every day, exerting your utmost effort and not being tired of the small things. In terms of the nation, fulfill your obligations by serving in the military, paying taxes, and not evading, shirking, or being opportunistic. Respond to donation drives with spare capacity and support public bond issues with assets, all according to one's ability. All of this may sound like commonplace talk, but is it not extremely ordinary to do? The invading country mobilizes its troops, but many do not know what they are fighting for, or they know that they are fighting for the fame and wealth of warlords and financial groups. However, the troops who rampage through China and die in foreign lands are indeed obtained through conscription. Regardless of wealth, poverty, nobility, or lowliness, names are registered in the military, and orders are executed immediately. The strictness of their military service is like this. This year's budget reaches one million yuan. Divided by the total population of their main island and territories, including the elderly, children, laborers, and even vagrants and beggars, every person, regardless of gender, poverty, or wealth, must pay hundreds of yuan for the costs of the invading military and government. The burden is so heavy. Compared to the Chinese people, who are fighting for survival, freedom, and happiness, for the country, for their ancestors, and for their descendants, even if there are ninety-two or three percent of them, they are still better than the Japanese. Why not! Because of this, should they not each uphold their conscience and abilities to fulfill their ordinary responsibilities? With a brilliant and wise leader at the top and a people who each fulfill their responsibilities below, victory in the resistance is certain, and nation-building will succeed. It is only a matter of time, and it is not far off.</p>
<p>The crucial task is to overcome material things with spirit, to compensate for shortages with diligence and frugality, to make up for past delays with redoubled efforts, and to make up for our lack of weapons and modern military equipment with a determination to sacrifice and a confidence in victory. Comrades, we must further recognize the Party's responsibility to the nation and the Party members' responsibility to the revolution. In the midst of the intense resistance, such a gathering is not an easy thing. We must make this plenary session set a definite, concrete, and thorough policy and plan for the second phase of the resistance. We ourselves must also establish before the portrait of the late Sun Yat-sen our own vows to be responsible, to fulfill our duties, and to fight to the end, to implement the Party's resolutions, to respect the Party's discipline, to consolidate the Party's foundations, and to exhaust the Party's mission. We do not need to pay attention to how many branches or difficulties there are in the period of resistance. We should always ask ourselves whether we have fulfilled our responsibilities. There is no self-reliant revolutionary party in the world that cannot lead the revolution to success, and there is no nation with a long history, vast territory, large population, and deep foundation that cannot achieve complete independence, equality, and freedom. Comrades, please remember that "knowing is difficult, doing is easy" is our motto, and "self-reliance" is our watchword. As long as we can do, can do well, can do quickly, can do hard, can do diligently, and can do practically, there is no reason for failure. Today, with the most fervent and sincere spirit, I hope for the success of this plenary session and wish for the success of our great cause of resistance, nation-building, and revolution.

<p>(Chongqing) Kuomintang personnel recently commented on Generalissimo Chiang's speech at the Fifth Plenary Session, saying that it can be seen from Chiang's speech that all parties and factions are becoming more united, and continuing the resistance has become a matter of course. Chiang's current determination to resist is ten times stronger than eight months ago. This can be proven by the strengthening of military forces and political institutions. Since Wang Jingwei's departure, none of the leaders in Chongqing have paid attention to Japan's gestures of seeking peace. (26th Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) According to reports, the Japanese army west of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway has retreated south from Tanbu to Wuhe Market. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received here this morning, yesterday evening, three Japanese motorboats carrying dozens of soldiers attempted to land near Beihai but were repelled by the Chinese army. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Japanese army in the northern Guangdong province is now continuing to retreat south along the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway and the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway. The vanguard of the Chinese army's counterattack has reached Shiling and Juntian, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. There are no major changes in the Xijiang and Dongjiang areas. The Japanese side is constantly reinforcing Sanshui Southwest and Dongguan Shitan to prevent the Chinese army's counterattack. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Sihui: The Japanese army in the Sanshui area has increased by more than 2,000 in the past two days, including more than 400 engineers and more than 100 cavalrymen, heading to the southwest. In addition, there are more than 200 people wearing gray uniforms, claiming to be a "mopping-up team," and are dispatched to various villages to carry out harassment. (25th Telegram)</p>
<p>Sihui: Starting on the 20th, the Japanese army has been transporting military supplies and food stored in the southwest to Sanshui one after another. On the morning of the 21st, more than 20 Japanese military vehicles and armored vehicles, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, departed from Hekou to Foshan. (23rd Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan's Political Strategy Toward China is Ultimately Heading Toward Failure.</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, Chinese political figures commented on Wu Peifu's meeting with puppet government officials and the telegram from the puppet organization in Beiping to Kuomintang leaders, in which Generalissimo Chiang's name was not mentioned. They said that Japan's political strategy toward China is ultimately heading toward failure. Japan's attempt to lure Chongqing officials into its embrace is a dream. The spokesman told an Associated Press reporter, "Do you think Chairman Lin and Sun Ke will betray Generalissimo Chiang?" He said that this proves that Japan has no understanding of the situation in China. Ariita's speech in the Diet even attempted to alienate democratic countries and separate the United Kingdom and the United States from France and the Soviet Union. These two things are extremely foolish. This time, the telegram from the puppet organization in Beiping did not attack Generalissimo Chiang and the Kuomintang, which shows that the Japanese side intends to seek peace, and its attitude towards Generalissimo Chiang has already changed. As for Wu Peifu's meeting with puppet organization officials, it is not important and not worth commenting on. (26th Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>The United States Has Actually Begun an Undeclared War Against Japan; The British-American Compromise on Loans to China Results in Arida Expressing His Determination to Abolish the Nine-Power Treaty.</h3>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator Lenroot said to the Senate today that since the United States has loaned China $25 million, the United States has actually begun an "undeclared war" against Japan. According to Lenroot, the success of the United States' decision to loan money to China is due to the result of discussions between the United Kingdom and the United States. After Eden's visit to the United States, it was completely completed. According to Lenroot's opinion, the United States' policy is now being controlled by the United Kingdom. Lenroot also advocated that the United Kingdom and France should now cede some islands in the West Indies in the Atlantic to the United States as compensation for war debts, and at the same time increase the United States' bases at sea. (26th United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arida replied to questions in the House of Representatives this morning, saying that Japan will recognize the new China "when China forms a unified central government." He then mentioned the Nine-Power Treaty, saying that the treaty can no longer meet the new situation in the Far East. However, the Foreign Minister did not want to state whether the Japanese government will abolish the treaty. The Foreign Minister also replied to a certain member's question that the Soviet Union's expansion of aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government will lead to a second world war, saying that since the China Incident occurred, Japan has been closely monitoring the Soviet Union's aid to the Chiang government and has never slackened. Even if the Western powers do not recognize the new situation in East Asia, the Japanese government intends to strive to make them understand it correctly, but it will never change its established policy. A certain member asked how long it would take to establish a new order in East Asia. Prime Minister Hiranuma replied that this is difficult to predict. However, Japan must be prepared to understand that the establishment of a new order in East Asia will require a long period of time. The Prime Minister also stated that the provisions of the National Mobilization Law will be implemented one by one. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance declared that the government intends to adhere to its foreign exchange policy and maintain the current exchange rate of the yen, which is one shilling and two pence per yen. Member Baron Asada asked about the joint defense of the Comintern by Japan, "Manchukuo," and China, and the strengthening of the anti-Comintern agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy. The Prime Minister replied that Japan must lead in the joint defense of the Comintern with "Manchukuo" and China. Therefore, the Japanese government has a policy of stationing troops in important locations. As for how the three countries' anti-Comintern agreement will be strengthened, it is not yet at a stage where it can be announced. Asada then strongly advocated expanding the agreement and forming a defensive alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Budget Committee Unfolds a Questioning Battle; The Government Only Makes Side Replies to Avoid Exposing Economic Weaknesses.</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo Electric Power Company: The questions in the Budget Committee of the Japanese Parliament are more important than those at the general meeting, because all secret or detailed discussions are conducted in the Budget Committee. The Budget Committee is neither completely open nor completely secret, so the records of proceedings published in newspapers are limited to the parts that can be made public. The Japanese House of Representatives held another Budget Committee meeting on the 25th. First, Takebe, a member of the Seiyukai, first questioned why the government has vigorously expanded industries such as fertilizer production, gold, rayon, and coal liquefaction, but there are still no achievements to speak of. Minister of Commerce and Industry Hatta replied that the reasons are very complicated and that he is working to promote them and that there will be progress in the future. It can be seen from this that the important industries that Japan has tried to develop in the past year have no achievements to speak of. Takeuchi, director of the Fuel Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, supplemented Hatta's reply, saying that liquid fuel made from coal is scheduled to be sold by the end of this year. Takebe then asked what countermeasures the government has against rising prices, anxiety in life, and malignant inflation. Hatta only replied that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Price Control Committee are actively working on it, and fortunately, the prices of daily necessities have not changed much. It can also be seen from this that the Japanese people feel extremely uneasy about rising prices and are extremely terrified of the trend of inflation. Takebe further questioned that the government bonds held by the Bank of Japan have not been sold out, so will it be more difficult to digest government bonds in the future? Ishiwata replied that the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan are now 350 million yen less than last year. The bank did not sell out all government bonds in order to avoid unnecessary inflation. Ishiwata's words were very cunning, and in order to avoid exposing its economic weaknesses, he only made side replies. Takebe, a member of the Seiyukai, then questioned the government about what plans it has for a debt reduction fund. Ishiwata replied that there are no concrete plans yet, but the government is very concerned about this. It can be seen from this how difficult the enemy's finances are. There is only an increase in government bonds and no way to reduce them. Takebe also asked what active plans the government has for economic control and long-term construction. Hatta replied that material control and economic control will be strengthened every day, so the difficulties of small and medium-sized business owners and the lack of materials will inevitably worsen. It can be seen from this that the enemy's peaceful industries will accelerate their collapse in the future, and the unemployment problem will also become more serious. Takebe also raised an important question, saying what is the government's outlook on the economic world. Ishiwata replied that foreigners' predictions about Japan's economic strength are completely wrong. In addition to engaging in long-term warfare, the government is still promoting a plan to expand production capacity as usual. Ishiwata avoided talking about the pessimistic facts. Takebe refused to let go and asked what guarantees the government has for the long-term construction's financial war expenses, which are even more important. Ishiwata finally revealed some of the truth, saying that the digestion of government bonds and the funds for long-term construction are indeed difficult, but the government is trying its best to encourage savings in order to avoid malignant inflation. At this point, the short-range questioning battle came to an end. Overall, Ishiwata and Hatta's replies fully demonstrate that the enemy's finances and economy have reached the end of their rope.

<h3>Lions and Tigers in Japanese Zoos Also Participate in Wartime Frugality Movement; Carnivores Taste Fish for the First Time.</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Two lions in the Tokyo Zoo are also participating in the national wartime frugality movement, abandoning horse meat and feeding them rabbit meat and fish. The two lions have two meals a day, and have been replacing horse meat with rabbit meat for several months, but they have only recently started eating three raw mackerel for dinner. According to the keepers, the two lions did not eat the fish for the first few days, but now the two lions are eating the fish with relish. After this change, the zoo can save more than two yen per lion per day, and will try to feed the zoo's leopards, tigers, and other carnivores with fish. According to the director of the Tokyo Zoo, during the World War, European zoos strictly prohibited the animals in the zoo from becoming pregnant in order to save food, but feeding carnivores with fish may be a world first.

<h3>Japanese Minister of the Army Explains Military Equipment Plan; Standard for Dealing with China and Russia.</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo News: The House of Representatives held a budget debate this afternoon. Dike Kangjiro, a member of the House of People's Representatives, asked that former Minister of the Army Tojo Hideki gave a speech to the military arms merchants' meeting on November 28 last year, advocating that Japan's military expansion plan should be based on a head-on conflict with the Soviet Union and China at the same time. What is the Minister of the Army's opinion on this matter? Minister of the Army Itagaki replied that each country's military equipment plan has its established standards. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, its military equipment plan is based on fighting on both the eastern and western battlefields at the same time. Itagaki then clarified Tojo's statement, saying that Japan is now concentrating its national resources to achieve the final goal of the China Incident, but preparing to work with China and the Soviet Union at the same time and achieving the goal of the China Incident are closely related. In other words, Japan must be prepared to continue to advance according to the current established policy, etc. Dike Kangjiro expressed his approval of the section described by the Minister of the Army, saying that the current international situation is such that it allows the Soviet Union to connect with the soil of North China and Mongolia, and its attitude is the same as that of others. The theory of two strong standards is necessary.

<h3>German Army Officer Praises the Red Army; Says the Battle of Zhanggufeng Last Summer Proved its Strong Combat Power.</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The official organ of the National Socialist Party here, "The Front," published an article by Captain Chisga of the German Army General Staff, praising the Soviet Red Army: "Although the Red Army has lost its significant power due to the removal of many senior officers, it is a mistake to ignore its gradual expansion. This expansion has of course increased its offensive strength. The bravery and perseverance of Russian soldiers in the World War and the Battle of Zhanggufeng last summer, and their knowledge of how to fight brilliantly under good leaders, is a clear and undeniable fact." Captain Chisga estimated that the Soviet Air Force has a strength of 9,000 aircraft, in addition to a reserve army, but not all of the aircraft are new. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>China is Bound to Win the War of Resistance Against Japan; British and American People Share the Same View.</h3>
<p>(London) The Times correspondent in China, Fleming, recently gave a speech at the Royal Joint Association on the war between China and Japan, saying: "Most observers believe that after the fall of Nanjing, Japan failed to negotiate peace with the National Government, or to force the Chinese government to accept peace conditions, and has in fact failed. Japan's expansion movement, which has been going on for many years, seems to have achieved something, but in terms of the final goal, it is not considered particularly satisfactory. In the past, Chinese soldiers were despised and often ridiculed. Today, although the country does not have well-trained staff officers, it has been able to resist a strong enemy with unprecedented unity and become a good soldier. The Chinese guerrillas are extremely active and are a thorn in Japan's side. It may be difficult to get rid of them in a few years. When I was in China, I witnessed Japanese planes bombing many times, but I never saw them hit a target." (25th Havas Telegram)</p>

As for the United States' Far East policy, its tendency is becoming more and more obvious. The country's government recently loaned China a huge sum of 25 million US dollars, and its ambassador to China, Johnson, returned to the country via the newly built Myanmar Road, which shows the increasingly active attitude towards the Far East situation."

<h3>German-Polish Celebration: Foreign Minister Beckertside</h3>

During the banquet, Mr. Beck gave the following welcoming address: "Our country's government is honored that the Foreign Minister of our friendly country, Germany, and his wife have come to our country. This visit also coincides with the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the German-Polish Peace Declaration in 1934, which makes this visit even more significant. The German-Polish Treaty of January 26, 1934, is one of the shortest treaties in the world to date, but its few words have expressed the courage, vision, and determination of Chancellor Hitler and General Piłsudski, and have become a historically significant achievement. We only need to review the successes and failures of European policies over the past five years to prove the value of this agreement. Since the heads of state of the two countries concluded this brief formula with the greatest determination, no major disturbances or tensions in the European political situation have been able to shake its solid foundation. Based on past experience, I hope to have the following gains in the future: (1) To continue the previous trend, to concentrate the energies of the two countries, and to strive for the creative work needed by the two countries and Europe; (2) To determine the starting point of good neighborliness, from today onwards, to enable the children of the two countries to grow up in a spirit of friendly relations and mutual understanding; (3) According to the correct principles of the two governments, any problems between the two countries can be resolved in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding of the interests of both countries. It is in this spirit that I raise my glass to wish for the prosperity of your country and the health of your head of state, Hitler."</p>
<p>After the Polish Foreign Minister finished his speech, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop stood up to give a reply, first expressing his deep gratitude for the grand welcome, and then saying, "I am very happy to reciprocate your country's visit. The generous welcome of your government to my wife and I proves your country's traditional hospitality. It is gratifying that my coming here coincides with the fifth anniversary of the signing of the 1934 agreement between our two countries. Five years of experience have proved that the path decided by the two heads of state, Piłsudski and Hitler, has determined the future policy of the two countries. The German government and people are eager for German-Polish relations to become stronger based on this agreement. The vision and determination of the two governments in signing the agreement have guaranteed that the two countries will solve all future problems with mutual respect and understanding."

<h3>Northwest Relations Extremely Important: Chinese Army Must Defend Firmly, Many Divisions of Troops Stationed Along the Yellow River, Japanese Army's Rear Is Harassed, Unable to Cross the River</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) – Chiang Ting-wen, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, met with an Associated Press reporter and made the following statement regarding the Japanese army's attempt to invade the Northwest: "The Chinese military strategy is to keep the Japanese army in Shanxi extremely busy, so that they have no time to cross the Yellow River and advance towards Xi'an. Up to now, although one or two thousand Japanese troops have attempted to cross the river four times at Yumen Ferry, north of Tongguan, it has not yet reached a serious stage, and the Japanese army has not attempted to cross the river at Yan'guan. Northwest relations are extremely important, so we will defend it at any cost. The surrounding high mountains are natural barriers, full of traps, artillery, and infantry networks. We have many divisions of Chinese troops stationed on the banks of the Yellow River, and there are also many divisions of Chinese troops with adequate firepower and complete equipment stationed west of Luoyang. We are more concerned about the Shanxi side of the Yellow River. The guerrillas in that area have not yet been defeated, and the Japanese army's rear is being harassed, so they have not been able to cross the Yellow River. The Japanese side's heavy vehicles and artillery have not yet been able to cross the ice that has formed on the river. Even if they cross, the ice will melt in the spring, and transportation will be extremely difficult to maintain. If the Japanese side wants to occupy the Northwest, they must occupy Lanzhou. There are three routes to attack Lanzhou. The first route is from Baotou through Wuyuan to Ningxia, but this route has deserts, hailstorms, and no water, grass, or food. Mechanized units are useless, and the Hui army will make extremely strong resistance. The second route is from the Longhai Railway directly to southwestern Henan and then to Tongguan, but Chinese guerrillas are extremely active in the mountains along the route, so the Japanese army must sacrifice thousands of lives if they want to attack along this route. The third route is to cross the Yellow River from Yumen and Hejin, but due to the activities of the Chinese guerrillas in Shanxi, the Japanese army dare not cross the river. All river crossings are currently controlled by the government, so the transportation of the guerrillas is still smooth and unimpeded. At present, the Chinese people in the war zone are not being evacuated, but are being persuaded to stay in the local area and given training, because they are supporters of the guerrillas, providing the guerrillas with food, clothing, shelter, and propaganda. There is currently no difficulty in conscription, and more Chinese troops are currently being trained." (Associated Press Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Tongguan: (1) The Japanese troops who advanced on the Chinese army's Huangyaoling, Heicaoping, Majialing, and Moling line, more than thirty li long, on the third, were the Xunkiri Brigade of the 20th Division, with more than 30 artillery pieces and 8 aircraft, totaling more than 4,000 people.

<h3>Sino-Foreign Charity Basketball First Game, Mixed Team Wins First Game Against Mackay &amp; Ling</h3>
<p>The Opening Throw Becomes a Problem, Overtime Game, Final Score 28 to 20</p>
<p>The first game of the Sino-Foreign Charity Basketball Tournament, sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, between the Mixed Team and Mackay &amp; Ling, opened at the China Youth Basketball Hall at 8:00 last night. In an extremely tense situation, the Mixed Team finally broke through the dull situation in the last eight minutes and won with a score of 21 to 19. However, due to Mackay &amp; Ling's protest, the game was extended for five minutes, and the situation changed abruptly. The Mixed Team was unstoppable and won with a score of 28 to 20. The score was tied at 10 points each in the first half. The audience was charitable, and the stadium was declared full, with an estimated 600 guests. The Mixed Team brought together the elites from the Paramount, Hualian, and Guoguang, while Mackay &amp; Ling was a combination of the Red and Gold teams. The strength of both sides was evenly matched, not wanting a rerun of the Shanghai Shenbao Cup Sino-American Charity Tournament. However, Mackay &amp; Ling lacked the strong player Haize, and their strength was inferior to the American team. The victory of the Mixed Team was indeed the expected result. The second game is scheduled to be held at the same venue at 8:00 PM on February 2nd, and the victory of the Mixed Team is hopeful.</p>
<p>Worth Celebrating</p>
<p>Last night's game was dull and deadlocked until the last eight minutes, when it was broken. Although the Mixed Team changed its lineup repeatedly, it was always difficult to achieve the ideal level of cooperation. The performance was particularly flustered, and the shooting was also inaccurate. The situation was almost entirely under the control of Mackay &amp; Ling, and the scores were repeatedly tied, with a difference of only one or two points. The Mixed Team was frustrated, while Mackay &amp; Ling's offensive was fierce and relentless. Fortunately, Mackay &amp; Ling was not used to the vast field of China Youth, and dozens of shooting opportunities were missed. Having practiced in the small field of West Youth, the shots were too close, and the effort was slightly lacking. Otherwise, the Mixed Team would have been defeated long ago. The sudden change in the last game was also unexpected and gratifying. In the second game, the Mixed Team will definitely be able to go to the next level. Sun Huipei should be promoted for individual performance.</p>
<p>Temporary Agreement</p>
<p>After Mr. Xi Yushu gave a report in Chinese and English, thanking all parties, Mr. Yuan Ludeng threw the opening ball on behalf of Mr. Yu Qiaqing. Mr. Yu was slightly ill and planned to be at the ceremony. The elderly man threw the first ball, which was obtained by Zhou Dayun and quickly passed to Chen Xuechong, who turned around and sent it into the basket. Then, during the break, Mackay &amp; Ling protested, saying that the Mixed Team got Mr. Yuan's pass to open the game. Therefore, the sides agreed that if the result differed by two points, the game would be extended for five minutes to determine the winner. Coincidentally, the result was 21 to 19, with the Mixed Team scoring two more points. Therefore, the game was extended for five minutes. The Mixed Team took advantage of the momentum and scored seven points in a row, finally winning with a score of 28 to 20.</p>
<p>Deadlock</p>
<p>Under the command of Mr. Shen Kunnian, the first lineup of the Mixed Team started with Zhou Dayun, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Sun Huipei, and Cai Yanxiong. Mackay &amp; Ling, on the other hand, was the Mackay &amp; Ling Red team. After Chen Xuechong scored the first point, Cai Yanxiong's half-court long shot was greatly appreciated by the audience. Zhou Dayun followed up with a contribution, and Cai also made a free throw. In this way, the Mixed Team suddenly took a great advantage with a score of 7 to 0. Mackay &amp; Ling remained calm and composed and immediately scored four points with free throws and shots. Xiang Long hurriedly replaced Li Zhenzhong, but could not contain the momentum of Mackay &amp; Ling. Sakin late sent Mandell to exceed with 8 to 7, and the situation of the Mixed Team was very bad. The cooperation was awkward, and the situation was entirely under the bombardment of Mackay &amp; Ling. Davun made a free throw to make it 8 each. Moore scored again to make it 10 to 8. At this time, Mackay &amp; Ling sent the whole team to the court, and both sides made very few points, and the first half ended in a tie at 10.</p>
<p>Spring Clouds Unfold</p>
<p>In the second half, Kong Guangyi replaced Zhou Dayun, and Mackay &amp; Ling remained the whole team, and a tug-of-war began again. Mackay &amp; Ling missed opportunities repeatedly, and the Mixed Team hurriedly replaced Kong Guangyi with Li Zhenzhong. Sure enough, the situation was invigorated, and Xiang Long's move took the lead with 14 to 13. The Mackay &amp; Ling Red team sent the whole team to the court again, and Davun also replaced Xiang Long. The battle suddenly unfolded like spring clouds, and Cai, Li, and Xuechong joined forces to make contributions, creating an advantage of 20 to 15 and 21 to 17. Unexpectedly, Sakin threw one shot, making it 21 to 19, and the game was extended for five minutes. In these last five minutes, the Mixed Team gave Mackay &amp; Ling a chance to do nothing. Big Cat made the first free throw, and Yanxiong made a half-court shot. The two scored two more points each, while Mackay &amp; Ling only scored one of two free throws by Brent. The result was a score of 28 to 20.</p>

<h3>Finance: Tianjin Banks Repeatedly Buy, Gold Prices Continue to Advance to High Peaks</h3>
<p>—Arrived at 2,037 Yuan Yesterday—</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market situation was still chaotic, generally rising and then falling, and finally rising again, depending on the amount of supply and demand from both sides and the tightness of foreign exchange. Initially, due to the lingering effects of the previous day and the fact that the foreign exchange was heavily purchased by the North China United Bank, the potential was suddenly tightened, so the buying frenzy was extremely vigorous for a time. In addition, Tianjin banks and Hong Kong banks secretly competed to buy, so the market price once rose to a high of 2,037 yuan. Later, it was suddenly heard that the foreign exchange was dumped by foreign wires and gradually returned to normal, so many general households tended to sell for profit. A certain silver building, acting on behalf of a businessman, was the first to sell, and a certain gold shop also turned from buying to selling, so the price plummeted, breaking into the 30 yuan level. Finally, due to the resurgence of the foreign exchange buying spree, it repeated to gather, and the Tianjin banks' buying intention re-emerged and repeatedly purchased, repeating the rise, and finally continued to rise by eight yuan. People's hearts in all directions were exceptionally firm, and the transaction was very lively, reaching 1,000 taels. The silver building's gold ornaments did not change. The customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Increased by Eight Yuan Again</p>
<p>Since morning, each bar (ten taels), initially due to the lingering effects of the previous day, the foreign exchange was heavily purchased by the North Bank (acting for the puppet bank), so the potential tightened, and people's hearts in the market became more firm and firm. Buyers shouted to buy at 2,030 yuan at the opening. It was not until 9:45 that a certain gold shop entered 50 taels of silver building help, with an opening price of 2,032 yuan. After the opening, the foreign exchange still reported softening, so the buying frenzy was even greater. In addition, a certain money exchange industry, acting on behalf of the Tianjin Bank and a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of the Hong Kong Bank, successively entered. Although a certain silver building acted on behalf of the businessman to profit, it was difficult to suppress the upward trend. The money exchange industry entered 50 taels of a certain silver building, with a price of 33 yuan. After a certain silver building sold it, it sold it to the gold shop for 50 taels, and the price was the same. A certain gold shop entered another 50 taels of silver building help, with a price of 35 yuan. Another gold shop entered 50 taels of money exchange industry, with a price of 37 yuan being the highest peak. But at 10:10, it suddenly reversed and turned tired. The foreign exchange was dumped by foreign wires, and the sellers suddenly became active. A certain silver building also carried out sales on behalf of a wealthy businessman, selling 50 taels each to the gold shop and a certain money exchange industry, with a price of 35 yuan each. After the gold shop accepted it, it immediately sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry, with a price of 34 yuan. The silver building help sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry, with a price of 33 yuan. The silver building help sold another 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry, with a price of 32 yuan. After this, the buyer's intention to enter became weaker, so it broke into the 30 yuan level. Gold shops mutually did 50 taels, with a price of 28 yuan. Silver building help sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry, with the same price. Gold shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry, with a price of 27 yuan. The money exchange industry sold 50 taels to the silver building help, with a price of 25 yuan. Finally, the silver building help sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry, with a price of 29 yuan as the noon price. In the afternoon, the potential military saw tightness again because the foreign exchange was absorbed by the China Bank. Moreover, the money exchange industry's intention to enter on behalf of the Tianjin Bank was strong again, so the initial opening rose by several yuan. First, the silver building help sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry, with a price of 34 yuan. A certain money exchange industry entered another 50 taels each from the silver building help and the same industry, with a price of 35 yuan each. Another 50 taels entered the silver building help, with a price of 36 yuan. Finally, the money exchange industry mutually did 50 taels, with a price of 2,035 yuan as the evening closing price, an increase of eight yuan compared to the previous day (a range of twelve yuan throughout the day). The selling price of the current gold number's gold plate was 2,045 yuan, and the purchase was 2,030 yuan. The current standard gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is no trading.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Still Hanging at the Original Price</p>
<p>The silver building's gold ornaments, the exchange out per tael, did not change. Datong Heng Lao Qingyun, etc., still responded to the original price of 206 yuan. New peers also hung the original price of 204 yuan, and purchased 198 yuan.</p>

The listed customs gold has not changed, still being 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 9 li. The Shanghai standard gold price has also not changed, still being 1,209 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>English and Japanese Gold Tickets Traded Frequently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by 0.0625. The foreign exchange system was very tight. Foreign firms were constantly settling accounts, and banks were not providing enough supply. Foreign wires were also rarely sold, so the process was weak. The American exchange rate was even tighter. Spot gold was still strong because the Tianjin banks were collecting it. Although retail investors were selling for profit, the market remained strong because the chips were dry. Foreign currencies continued to rise due to the support of foreign exchange and spot gold. The demand for British gold pounds was relatively strong, and the increase was slightly higher. Japanese gold tickets were also traded frequently. Few transactions were made through the association. Only Xiangfeng sold US gold tickets for 500 yuan, Hongchang sold Hong Kong tickets for 450 yuan, and Tongfeng sold British gold tickets for 100 pounds, all of which were absorbed by Dongtai. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by 2 jiao, British gold tickets rose by 8 fen, US gold tickets rose by 1 fen, Hong Kong tickets rose by 6 li, French franc tickets rose by 1 li, Canadian tickets rose by 2 fen, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Diverge</h3>

Also, the Bombay silver report: the Indian silver market remains stable, with the spot price unchanged. Near and far terms both increased by one anna.</p>
<h3>Demand for Cash is Strong Again, Discount Rate Suddenly Returns to High</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and bills suddenly rose from stable. Initially, it still hovered above 35 yuan per thousand yuan, which was still flat. Later, the discount rate increased to 36 yuan and 2.5 jiao due to the increased demand for cash. At noon, it was 36 yuan, and in the afternoon, it reached as high as 36 yuan and 5 jiao. Finally, it was 36 yuan and 2.5 jiao, which was one yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>"United Bank" Absorbs Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Although Foreign Wires are Dumping, British and American Exchange Rates are Still Tight</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market was tight yesterday because the puppet bank of North China suddenly came to absorb it, and foreign firms and others were frequently settling accounts because the end of the year was approaching. However, most foreign banks were unwilling to provide settlements, so the situation was quite tight. At one point, the British gold was tightest, reaching 8.28125 pence, and the American gold reached 16.125 yuan. Fortunately, foreign wires and HSBC dumped it, so it gradually became flat. However, the result was still firm. The trading volume on that day was particularly strong. The Hong Kong exchange rate also showed a softening trend because foreign banks were quite strong in purchasing it.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bars, both near and far, shrank. New York's spot price remained flat. London's raw gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies did not change, the exchange rate between British and French currencies increased by 7 centimes, and the exchange rate between British and Shanghai currencies remained the same. The exchange rate between American and British currencies increased by 0.0625, the exchange rate between American and French currencies increased by 1.875, and the exchange rate between American and Shanghai currencies decreased by 3 fen. The central government's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. At the early opening, the bank's selling price for spot British exchange was 8.359375 pence, and the selling price for spot American exchange was 16.28125 yuan, both of which were flat compared to the previous closing. After the opening, although the foreign wires dumped British gold at 8.359375 pence, there was no change because the banks took advantage of the cheap prices. HSBC's listed price did not change. In addition, the balance tax on silver was reduced by 0.25. After this, the puppet bank of North China only absorbed British gold at 8.3125 pence and American exchange at 16.25 yuan. Moreover, it was difficult for foreign merchants to sell their stomachs, and the market price gradually tightened to 8.28125 pence for British gold and 16.125 yuan for American exchange. Suddenly, the foreign wires came again and sold American exchange to various British and American banks at 16.25 yuan. Both the Hui Bank and the banks also sold American exchange to foreign firms at 16.1875 and 16.25 yuan, and British gold at 8.328125 to 8.34375 pence. In addition, the money exchange industry also sold Hong Kong exchange to Andaholland Wahyi Huabi from 55.875 yuan to 56 yuan. The situation gradually returned to relaxation. The noon closing price was 8.34375 pence for British gold and 16.25 yuan for American exchange.</p>
<p>Later, China Bank did British gold at 8.328125 pence and American exchange at 16.25 yuan. Foreign commercial banks also did the same price with each other, so the situation lacked change. After entering, Chinese and foreign banks took in Hong Kong exchange from the money exchange industry at only 55.875 yuan and 55.75 yuan, causing the market price to be slightly higher. The evening closing price for banks was 8.328125 pence for British exchange and 16.21875 yuan for American exchange. As a result, British exchange was tighter by 0.03125, American exchange was softer by 0.0625, and Hong Kong exchange shrank by 0.0625 compared to the previous closing. The following is a record of the transactions that day.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Debt is Flat and Tired</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities dark market was relatively stable. The crazy selling of the tenth of the previous day has stopped, so the rumors have gradually subsided. The fundamental reason why morale has not been boosted is still the outflow of spot goods caused by this decision to reform, the large households' selling of public prices, and the entry of cotton yarn to seek unexpected profits is also one of the reasons. If there are no unexpected blows in the future, there will be a turning point after several rotations, because it has not suffered any fundamental damage. Yesterday's situation, the morning start was still very weak. First, there were sales of No. 7 and No. 59, and then there were outings of No. 31 and Tongkang, and the supply and demand were still very different, which was a little smaller than the previous day by one jiao to six jiao. In the afternoon, the selling pressure eased slightly. No. 4, except for the sale of Class B, had considerable income, and retail investors also slightly made up for the short positions. Class C and E were in greater demand, so the result was that Class C and E had rebounded by 4 jiao, and the rest continued to be smaller by 1 to 4 jiao. There are still many fluctuations in the future. The total turnover was 5 to 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>The stock turnover of the Zhonghua Book Company was more than 30 shares, and the price was 23 yuan and 3 jiao.</p>
<p>London Chinese foreign debt listed prices on the 25th of this month (Wednesday) still belonged to the market with no transactions, and the prices did not change much. Only the Chrisp Public Debt rose by another 1 pound, with a price of 35 pounds. The British Jin Shanhou Public Debt British issued debt tickets fell by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 48 pounds. There were two shipments of British physical goods today, including the Sino-French American Dollar 5% Public Debt with printed debt tickets, sold for 5,000 pounds (that is, 25,000 US dollars) with a selling price of 68 pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence, which is only a slight discount of 2 shillings and 6.75 pence according to the market price, but the selling price on the previous day shrank sharply by 17 shillings and 6 pence. Also, the Jinpu Railway original issued public debt German issued printed lottery debt tickets also sold for 25,000 pounds, with a selling price of 16.5 pounds, which is still a premium of 0.5 pounds, but the selling price on the previous day shrank by 0.5 pounds. It can be seen from this that the market sentiment is trending towards weakness.</p>
<p>London British Far East Company stock listed prices on the 25th of this month (Wednesday), the market has not changed.</p>
<h3>Kaiping Dividend Increases</h3>
<p>Sales Surge, New Wells Opened</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the demand for coal has increased sharply. From July 1937 to June 1938, the Kaiping Mining Bureau sold 4,213,000 tons of coal, an increase of 67,000 tons compared to the previous year. The gross operating profit also increased from 3,924,516 yuan in national currency to 12,368,157 yuan in national currency. After deducting the company's debt repayment fund of 2,260,242 yuan in national currency and the depreciation and amortization of 641,023 yuan in national currency, the remaining profit was 9,023,753 yuan in national currency, an increase of 3,271,756 yuan in national currency compared to the previous year's profit. It is equally distributed between the British Kaiping Coal Mining Company and the Chinese Australian Mining Company. The half of the Kaiping Coal Mining Company should be converted into 252,914 pounds in British gold, an increase of 77,849 pounds compared to the previous year's 175,065 pounds in British gold. Including interest income, it reached a total of 272,572 pounds in British gold. After deducting various payments, the net remaining was 215,212 pounds in British gold. After deducting taxes and other expenses of 30,716 pounds in British gold, a dividend can be distributed at an annual rate of 7.5%, (the previous year was 5%, and the year before was 2.5%). The remaining 37,495 pounds in British gold are rolled into the next term. At present, the demand for Kaiping Australian coal has increased greatly in Japan, North China, and Shanghai. The Bureau has already opened a new well, which is expected to increase coal production by 1 million tons per year. The sales record for more than five months since July last year has reached 2,229,000 tons, an increase of 42% compared to the same period last year. The Kaiping Company's shareholders' meeting was held in London on December 29 last year. After the dividend was paid, the market price of the stock was 23 yuan in Shanghai for each share with a face value of 1 pound in British gold, and the London market price was 16 shillings and 6 pence in British gold.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculators Unable to Drag On, Yarn Prices Fall Rapidly, Returning to the 400 Yuan Level, Futures of Japanese Yarn Squeezed</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been rising for several days, suddenly fell yesterday, and the decline was quite sharp. This kind of rebound after a long rise is not surprising and is expected. Moreover, the rise in consecutive days was entirely due to the purchase of the financial sector, and it was not driven by the actual sales market. Therefore, once the speculators stopped buying, and the customer business remained bleak, the general spot merchants, seeing that the customer's needs were not coming, were eager to sell. The holders were also accumulating continuously, the amount was huge, and there was a sign of fullness. For a temporary rest, the chips were slightly relaxed, and the falling wind suddenly became strong. Moreover, 20 count Double Horse fell directly from 405 yuan to 396 yuan. Then, the decline was unavoidable. It was fierce and attracted a certain firm in Guangzhou to come to the market for cheap goods, so the false wind was stopped by it, and it rose again by 3 yuan. However, the fundamental problem of cotton yarn can still be stabilized one step further than in the past, because the raw materials are difficult to loosen. The future still depends on actual transactions to support the value.</p>
<p>Checking yesterday's spot yarn market, many people in the same industry were at a loss when the market opened in the morning. Inquiries revealed that actual sales were still unchanged, and speculators did not come. Only Shantou merchants had scattered transactions. However, sellers gathered, and the opening price of 20 count Double Horse was 405 yuan, which was not much different from the previous day. Only two packages were traded, and customers shouted sales continuously. Morale suddenly dropped, and market prices fell step by step. The price of 20 count Heavenly Girl fell from 398 yuan to 396 yuan. Double Horse fell by 5 yuan to 400 yuan, breaking the big barrier again, directly to 396 yuan. The stack order price fell to 394 yuan. After a while, the price became cheap, and Wanxing Company in Guangzhou came to enter the stack order goods, and speculators also came to collect, and immediately rose by 2 to 3 yuan. The final closing price of 20 count Double Horse was 399 yuan, and the stack order price was 397 yuan, and the momentum turned to a stable path. Check the statistics of 1,260 packages traded in the morning. Transactions in the same industry accounted for two-thirds. As a result, the market price of 20 count Double Horse fell by 6 yuan, Heavenly Girl fell by 6 yuan, White Flying Boat fell by 10 yuan, Flying Tiger fell by 5 yuan, and Double Earth fell by 4.5 yuan. The decline of 10 count coarse yarn was slower, because the bottom was thinner. The factory did not take any action. Today's exports included 80 pieces of cotton yarn to Tianjin, 50 pieces to Yantai, 20 pieces to Quanzhou, 300 pieces to Shantou, and 15 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases made by each group is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market, because the end of January is approaching, all the short-selling ball transactions lacked backing, and buyers were unwilling to release them, so the local yarn price has fallen by 5 to 6 yuan. Japanese yarn is showing tight, and market prices continue to rise, but actual demand is still scattered. However, futures seem to have a squeezing appearance. The spot yarn price of 20 count Water Moon is 320 yuan, and the current month's price is 321 yuan, inverting the spot price. The spot yarn price of 20 count Blue Phoenix is 318 yuan, and the next month is 320 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Also Unavailable, Huge Transactions</h3>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton, American cotton, is currently quite firm because of the strong spot transactions, and exporters also have huge transactions. The government's loan cotton sales problem has not yet been resolved, so the cotton price when new flowers are released is difficult to predict. Yesterday, someone interviewed US Agriculture Secretary Henry Wells and asked about the intention of convening an international cotton industry conference. According to Mr. Wells, this conference is nothing new, but the oversupply of cotton is a serious problem shared by the world, which the United States cannot solve. For example, if all the US government's surplus loan cotton is sold to the world, the price of US cotton will inevitably fall to the 6-cent level. At that time, the economic difficulties of the United States can be broken, and domestic exports can also take the opportunity to sell US cotton, and farmers can also dump their products, while cotton growers and exporters in India, Brazil, and Egypt will be severely hit. Finally, Mr. Wei said to others that it was his intention to hold an international cotton industry conference, but he never wanted to invite others to come, but hoped that the cotton-producing countries could automatically and enthusiastically participate. Yesterday, New York rose by 2 to 3 pounds, India including forecasts fell by half a rupee, and Egypt fell by 7 to 8 pounds. Yesterday's exchange rate did not change much. Converted into legal currency, American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 2 jiao per dan, while Indian cotton and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no huge transactions in the foreign cotton market in this city. Except for Anda Factory's order of 500 bales of Indian cotton Bairoch, with a combined delivery price of 72 yuan, the rest of the factories were very quiet. According to public opinion, if the exchange rate for foreign cotton transactions can be extended, each factory will purchase in large quantities because the inventory will be exhausted. The amount of transactions and prices are listed below.</p>
<h3>In the Midst of Factory Closures, the Selling Price of White Pack Cotton is Still High</h3>
<p>The local cotton business is becoming more depressed. The market price of white pack cotton remains firm. The factories are unanimously procuring Indian and American coarse and fine cotton to replenish, and the local cotton is about to close. In fact, the source is thin, the bottom has dried up, the selling price is very high, and there is no huge amount to buy. The situation is not satisfactory, and there is no good way to save it without adjusting foreign cotton. As for the cotton shops, in view of the difficult transportation routes, the north is controlled and not allowed to export, and the Qun Daqing company is mostly trading in foreign cotton, which shows the lack of local cotton. Japanese factories have been lifeless for a long time, but their foreign cotton purchase orders are very enthusiastic. The source of Tonghua is still not thin. The dock has 2,495 bales, and 580 pieces from Xin'gang, 330 pieces from Baimao, and 900 pieces from Beisha. There are still 40 pieces exported to Quanzhou and 20 pieces to Hong Kong. The current cotton selling prices and quantities are recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Stockpiling of National Cloth is Extremely Strong, and the Financial Sector is the Most Prominent, East Piece Hand Goods are Unwilling to Sell Lightly</h3>
<p>The actual sales of national cloth in various regions, except for the Sichuan-Yunnan merchants, are shrinking. However, the stockpiling of the same industry is extremely strong, and the financial sector is the most prominent. The stockpiling volume is counted in thousands of pieces per batch. There have also been huge transactions of military coarse cloth. Recently, Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory has sold more than 100 pieces of 16-pound Double Dragon coarse cloth. The prices of various grades of coarse cloth in the factory have also been raised by 1 to 2 jiao each. Yihe coarse cloth, Ning-Shao merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of the same grade of cloth according to the market price. Weihaiwei merchants purchased 50 bales of Double Cage and other brands of coarse cloth. Dyeing factories in this street purchased 40 to 50 pieces of fine twill. Fuchou, floral cloth, satin, chopped pattern, and blank cloth are the most frequent deliveries of orders this month. The demand from Wen, Yong, and Taiwan merchants is still strong, and there are still telegrams urging deliveries every day. However, the Shanghai factories have not been able to load smoothly due to the tightening of silver remittance quotas. The amount of colored twill, colored cloth, bleached cloth, bleached twill, Kunming, and Chengdu is the most, and more than 2,500 pieces are continuously procured. The Taizhou area of Jiangbei merchants added 1,200 pieces of satin, serge, tribute, and various colors of blue cloth. Jiangxi Guangfeng and the Zhejiang road Tiantai, Suian, and Shaoxing are more indifferent in their buying. Only 4 to 500 pieces of tribute, flannel, bleached cloth, and colored cloth were packed.</p>
<p>East cloth, yesterday's fine cloth and fine twill sales, because the actual sales and the stockpiling of Japanese yuan were mutually pulling up prices, gradually rising. Fine cloth is especially needed. The Dragon Head and Color Ball brands are regarded as the standard, and each piece has increased sharply by 1 jiao and a half. Fine twill has risen by 5 fen to 1 jiao. Throughout the day, all brands of fine cloth and fine twill were sold. The dyeing factories on this street and the hoarders with market goods in mind have entered more than 2,000 pieces. Tianjin merchants have also written in nearly 1,000 pieces. The general psychology of the industry is that in view of the high market price, it is difficult to compensate. Even if there are hand goods, they are all tightened and not loosened, so the market is very firm.</p>
<p>Today's exports include 400 pieces of piece goods to Yantai, 40 pieces to Yuhe, 265 pieces to Quanzhou, and 155 pieces to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea   Silk Market Disorder</h3>
<p>White filature price for end-users rises by one hundred yuan; Indo-French firm suddenly deals in raw silk.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market saw Japanese and American interests seemingly firm; the Exchange market situation saw a slight increase of 0.05 taels in New York, while Yokohama rose by one yuan. Local sales to British and French exporters have not yet begun. In the local market, the price for end-users is thirty yuan higher than that of foreign firms, so the center of gravity of the silk market has not yet shifted. However, end-user transactions lack standards, and buyers are often overly optimistic, making disorder inevitable. Yesterday, the general selling price of White Filature B was 1360 yuan. The price of superior quality B-grade silk of 20-22 denier threads was approaching 1400 yuan. A total of 350 piculs were traded. The Indo-French firm suddenly became active yesterday, with 50 piculs of "Thousand Gold White Soil" silk traded at an opening price of 550 yuan, an increase of 5 to 10 yuan compared to the previous calculation. (The white filature price for end-users has already risen by one hundred yuan compared to the previous month.)</p>
<h3>Grain   Flour Sales to North China Suddenly Brisk; Exports Today Also Not Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw a sudden surge in sales. Early in the morning, transactions among customer groups were quite lively. A major merchant in North China was also absorbing flour in the market, leading to increased transactions. Various small-scale buyers from Yantai, Qinhuangdao, and other places showed a growing appetite. South Seas buyers also became eager to purchase. The market immediately became lively. A total of 60,000 to 70,000 bags of various brands of flour, including No. 2, 3, and 4, were sold. Nearly 10,000 bags were handled by this street. The majority of the buyers were from Hebei and Shandong provinces, followed by those from Shantou. The price of No. 2 flour of "Vehicle and Ship" brand remained stable at the original price of 4.8 yuan, "Blue Ship" brand at 4.6 yuan, "Red Blue Fisherman" at 4.4 yuan, and "Red God of Wealth" at 4.35 yuan. The market has already felt stable.</p>
<p>Today, flour exports include 7,000 bags to Tianjin, 3,000 bags to Yantai, 1,400 bags to Xinghua, 1,500 bags to Xiuyu, and 18,500 bags to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Wheat   Mill Demand is Relatively Strong; However, Price Increases and Decreases are Both Difficult</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market situation was difficult for both increases and decreases, continuing to show a fluctuating trend. Inquiries from various mills have increased compared to before. Recently, the source of supply in various places has been limited. Yesterday, 600 bags arrived from Xingang. The goods owners, considering the production price plus miscellaneous expenses, found that the cost was higher than that in the Shanghai market, and they were unwilling to sell at a loss. The mills, seeing that the trend was difficult to suppress, gradually revealed their eagerness. As a result, the number of transactions remained limited. A total of 2,000 bags of Wuhu purple skin wheat and Chaozhou wheat, and 3,000 bags of Jiangbei Puzhen wheat were jointly handled by Fuxin and Fufeng Mills. The highest price was still 4.8 yuan, with a slight decrease of a few cents for medium-quality wheat.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Difficult to Advance</h3>
<p>Warehouse stocks are congested and sales are sluggish</p>
<p>Domestic Rice: Yesterday, a total of over 6,000 bags of "He Xia No. 14" and "Vehicle Wheel Bun" rice arrived. The sales field is still sluggish. It is heard that the warehouses in Shanghai are congested with stocks, with some holding 700,000 bags, causing panic. Large hoarders feel that there is nowhere to store additional goods if they want to purchase. Because of the unstable market, this street rarely inquires about purchases, so most of the goods failed to be sold. The market is stagnant, and the price of thick and thin japonica rice has fallen by a few cents to a dime. Duyang and Jianduan also fell by about a dime, but Bianyuan rice is still holding its original price due to the scarcity of goods and the relatively firm foothold.</p>
<p>Customer Xian Rice: Yesterday's source of supply continued to arrive by train. 1,800 bags came from Hupu. Although new shipments have not yet been fully cleared, the goods stored are still continuously arriving in Shanghai. Major merchants and brokers still want to hold on and wait for a good price, while small merchants plan to close their positions as soon as possible. Affected by the arrival of "Benjian" rice, which sold sharply and fell by a dime, Jingwu and other xian rice were suppressed by 5 to 6 cents. "Gaojing" xian rice, which was previously quoted at 11 yuan, was willing to be sold at 10.08 or 0.09 yuan, while the unspoken price of Zhongguan Ju fell below the 10 yuan mark, it is said.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains  Soybean Market Active</h3>
<p>Soybean Arrivals: Because the Lunar New Year is approaching, most traders have rushed to close their positions, so the source of supply is scarce, and the stock is in good shape because the market is active in sales. Superior and medium-grade goods are the most popular because purchases tend to avoid the heavy and take the light. Therefore, the market rose by another 5 to 6 cents yesterday, with over 2,000 bags of various soybeans traded. The destinations are still mainly five or six groups of buyers from Hong Kong, Lϋ, Shantou, Xiamen, and this street. As for import and export conditions, yesterday 2,650 bags of soybeans arrived from Tianjin, 2,200 bags of peanuts arrived from Yantai, and 220 bags of peanuts arrived from Weihaiwei. Today (27th), 1,090 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Shantou, 790 bags to Hong Kong, 1,020 bags to Quanzhou, 480 bags to Xiuyu, and 1,840 bags of soybeans to other ports. 200 bags of peanuts are being shipped to Shantou, 120 bags to Quanzhou, 3,310 bags to Hong Kong, 11,000 pieces of soybean cake to Shantou, 1,700 pieces to Xinghua, 8,200 pieces to Quanzhou, 550 pieces to Xiuyu, 200 pieces of peanut oil to Quanzhou, and 2,350 pieces to Hong Kong. 3,500 cans also arrived from Weihaiwei yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wheat Bran Turns Sharply Upward</h3>
<p>Wheat bran sales in the mainland market are in great demand during this twelfth lunar month, and with the support of some gardeners, the market has turned sharply upward in the past two days. Yesterday, the market for Fuxin large bags opened at 3.27 yuan and quickly rose to 3.3 yuan, closing at 3.35 yuan. The trend is that the Lunar New Year is approaching, and hoarding is mostly based on capacity, and the momentum in the market feels short, so the actual demand is strong and the market price is easy to prosper, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market  Hainan Red Rises Another Two Dimes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw quieter transactions and a stable trend. The Association's quoted price for No. 24 Dutch raw white spot goods was 24.85 yuan. Goods from this warehouse were 25 yuan, and transshipment goods were 16.8 yuan. Taikoo "Vehicle White" remained stagnant. "B Mark" East warehouse goods were 23.85 yuan, and West warehouse goods were 23.95 yuan. The lower grades also lacked changes. Domestic sugar houses, such as Chaozhou's Qibai, Zhiyang, and Chenchaoqing, continued to offer limited quantities at the same prices. Newly arrived white packaged Hainan red sugar from Guangdong had a better color and luster, with 201 bags opening at 12.4 yuan, an increase of 2 dimes compared to the previous quotation. Only a few dozen bags of inferior white sugar were offered from Fujian at the original price. Because of the lack of goods in the production area, the owners of superior white sugar all instructed to hold their positions and unanimously called for increases, but because "Vehicle White" in the Shanghai market was more suitable, it was unable to rise excessively.</p>
<h3>Metals   Black Iron Sheet Sells as Soon as it Arrives</h3>
<p>The market for black iron sheet has been quite brisk recently. Vacuum bottle factories have a large appetite for sales, and enamel factories also have a strong intention to purchase, so there is a feeling that the market is short of circulating goods. Since the day before yesterday, new goods have arrived at Xin Taikoo, Qichang, Gonghexing and other warehouses, but most of the goods that arrived have been sold, so there is still a lack of spot goods in the market, and the market is still able to maintain prices without falling. Currently, 26-inch goods are selling for 24 yuan, and 36-inch goods are quoted at prices ranging from 25 to 27 yuan. First-grade goods are quoted at 15.5 yuan, and second-grade billet goods are sold for 14 yuan. It is estimated that over 2,000 to 3,000 piculs were sold yesterday, but they were all purchased by local factories in this street, and few customer groups handled purchases, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods  Green Cake Arrives by Day Ship</h3>
<p>From Tianjin</p>
<p>Because six to seven hundred bags of green cake have arrived by day ships for several consecutive days, there is no concern for a shortage, and the market suddenly loosened. Yesterday, it was heard that the opening price was 13 yuan, settled at 12.8 to 12.6 yuan. Because the upper grades also turned down, Gen cake was 16 yuan, box Zhuang Pai cake was 14 yuan, and the next grade was 13.8 yuan. Mainland buyers are still continuing to purchase, but with the increased arrival of goods, the sellers will find it difficult to maintain prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 250 bags of jujubes arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Letter   The Indian Cotton Purchased by Shenxin is Sold by the Fuka Foreign Firm</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: According to a letter from member Jifeng Cotton Shop, the "Shenbao" commercial news foreign cotton transaction column today stated that Shenxin imported 300 pieces of Indian cotton spot goods, and that this cotton was owned by a certain stock company, which is inconsistent with the facts. On the 24th of this month, our shop purchased 300 pieces of Indian cotton spot goods delivered to the warehouse from the Fuka Foreign Firm, a foreign merchant in this city, at 64 yuan in cash per group, and then sold them to Shenxin No. 2 Factory on the 25th of the same month at 65.3 yuan in cash per picul delivered to the factory. There are complete orders to prove this. We request that your association write a letter requesting correction, etc. According to this, the various sections mentioned in the letter are all true, and there is order proof. The results of your newspaper's investigation are obviously inconsistent. As it concerns the reputation of merchants, we request that you promptly correct this to show the truth. Respectfully, the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Trade Association, January 26, year 28.</p>

<h3>The Efficacy of Duck Juice</h3>
<p>— Qin Bo</p>
<p>Chicken juice and beef juice already known for their efficacy, duck juice as a nourishing product after illness</p>
<p>Nourishment must suit the constitution. The efficacy of chicken juice and beef juice is well known, but duck juice is also an excellent nourishing product after febrile diseases.</p>
<p>First, theoretically speaking: febrile diseases most easily burn qi and blood, consuming fluids, so after illness, there are often deficiency-heat phenomena such as dry mouth, emaciation, constipation, and yellow urine. Duck's nature is sweet and cold, sweet can tonify the middle, and cold can clear heat, so it mainly tonifies the middle, removes exogenous heat, and benefits the viscera and water passages (see Compendium of Materia Medica). Using it to nourish febrile diseases has the wonderful effect of strengthening the wall and clearing the field.</p>
<p>Second, practically speaking: when febrile diseases have largely subsided, but the body and spirit are exhausted and appetite is sluggish, consuming duck juice makes one feel clear, rich, and palatable, gradually stimulating the appetite. Without the use of intestinal moisturizing agents, bowel movements are naturally smooth, and without the use of water-regulating formulas, urination naturally increases. After four or five days, the efficacy is significant, far surpassing ginseng and dendrobium.</p>
<p>The method of making juice is the same as that of chicken juice, but the oil floating on top of the duck juice must be removed completely, only drinking the clear liquid. The amount can be as much or as little as desired. By extension, for those with yin deficiency and internal heat who seek nourishment, this is also the best choice. Many patients who have been instructed by me and have benefited cannot be listed exhaustively. If anyone sees this article and confirms its efficacy, I would be grateful.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Xie Yenong</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is quite common among young people. The cause of nocturnal emission as a disease is mostly due to the result of masturbation, which is a matter of education, so let us set it aside for the moment. In terms of disease, there is still the matter of dreaming of nocturnal emissions. The pathology is mostly due to weakness of the kidneys, the vas deferens losing its ability to protect, resulting in frequent emissions, four or five times a month for the mild cases, eight or nine times for the severe cases. People with initial nocturnal emissions often neglect it and do not pay attention, or because they are ashamed to tell others, they are unwilling to seek medical treatment, allowing the disease to gradually worsen. Over time, the constitution becomes increasingly weak, developing into pale complexion, listlessness, weak memory, dizziness, tinnitus, sore waist, thinness, and other weak phenomena, affecting the studies and careers of young people. It is no small matter. Those suffering from this disease should be vigilant!</p>
<p>Euryale ferox, also known as Gorgon Fruit, is often sold by vendors carrying loads in alleys during July and August (South goods stores sell it at halftime). This thing is sweet and astringent, has the effect of strengthening the kidneys, tonifying the spleen, benefiting essence, and treating nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea. Regular consumption can cure both new and old nocturnal emissions. For consumption, wash the Euryale ferox clean, boil it in water, add a little white sugar, and eat it as a snack; or grind the Euryale ferox into a fine powder, mix it with white sugar, and take it with boiling water. Another method is to cook porridge with two ounces of japonica rice and one ounce of Euryale ferox every day. These two methods combine treating the disease with diet, and the price is low, both economical and convenient. Those suffering from nocturnal emission may wish to try it.</p>
<p>Heart of lotus can also be used as a snack. During the summer lotus season, there is a kind of lotus stamen, which is collected by pharmacies as a medicine for treating nocturnal emission and leucorrhea. If you keep fresh lotus stamens in mind, boiling them to make tea is surprisingly effective for treating nocturnal emission. In addition, there are two kinds of Coix Seed (also known as Yi Ren Rice) and Rosa laevigata (fruit food), which are also wonderful dietary supplements for treating nocturnal emission.</p>
<h3>Aconite</h3>
<p>— Liu Minshu</p>
<p>Wind paralysis and prevention of wind paralysis</p>
<p>Aconite is shaped like a taro and is not a strange thing in itself. It is produced in Sichuan, and the people of Sichuan often use it as food. According to customs and habits, whenever they feel heavy, they use aconite and beef, cooked together as a side dish. Not only is it palatable and filling, but it also has the effect of preventing wind paralysis. Taking it for a long time makes the body light and strong, and the spirit is doubled. If it is not cooked for a long time, it will only cause numbness. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong are low-lying and close to the sea, and are prone to wind-cold-dampness diseases. Those who want to prevent them can try cooking and taking it. The method is to use half a catty of beef, one tael of white aconite block, and a piece of ginger broken into pieces. Cook them together for six hours, without adding salt. If you cannot eat it bland, you can add a little salt. When eating, the white aconite block should also be chewed finely and eaten. Those who have already suffered from wind paralysis, numbness, soreness, and pain will definitely see results if they take it regularly.</p>
<h3>Two Formulas for Frostbite</h3>
<p>— Gong Xingqi</p>
<p>(One)</p>
<p>In winter, if the hands and feet are exposed to cold for too long, the qi and blood will stagnate, and the extravasated blood will break out of the blood vessels and gather into red lumps, which will cause frostbite. When exposed to heat, it will first itch, and then ulcerate. If the congealed and extravasated blood is not dispersed, the ulceration will become deeper and deeper, and it will not heal for a long time. This formula uses the method of relieving coagulation and activating blood to treat it. The formula uses eight qian of Imperata cylindrica ginger, four qian of Evodia rutaecarpa, and four qian of safflower. Boil them in water and wash the affected area. Regardless of whether the frostbite has ulcerated or not, it is extremely effective. If it has not ulcerated, washing with this decoction will disperse the extravasated blood and prevent it from ulcerating. If it has ulcerated, you must first disperse the congealed extravasated blood before you can activate blood and generate muscle. Otherwise, it will not heal by spring, leaving a deep scar. Laborers cannot move because of this, which is especially pitiful. Wealthy families also suffer greatly from this disease. Although the herbs in this formula are not strange, the treatment is correct. It is extremely easy to obtain and inexpensive to use. It has been used repeatedly with effective results, and many people have been cured. For severe cases, wash several more times. I hereby make it public to help those who are displaced, cold, and poor to relieve the pain in their hands and feet, which is also my wish.</p>
<p>(Two) Lan Xiaomei</p>
<p>When the northwest wind rises, friends suffering from frostbite will all frown, burdened with worries. It will not only be red, swollen, and feverish, but also unbearably itchy. After ulceration, it will ooze water and form scabs that do not fall off. It will then heat up again, itch again, and ooze water, continuously extending for three or four months.</p>
<p>The cause of frostbite is that dampness stagnates in the capillaries. When it is blown by the cold wind, it coagulates with the blood and becomes inflamed, thus causing redness, swelling, fever, itchiness, and even ulceration. Although there are many methods to treat frostbite, they are all superficial treatments that cannot be thorough, so the treatment cannot eradicate the root cause. Moreover, dampness always has to find a way out. If frostbite does not develop, other diseases will develop, and the pain is still unavoidable.</p>
<p>Now I can introduce a very effective prescription: When frostbite has already formed red and swollen lumps, urgently use five qian of Ramulus Cinnamomi, five qian of walnut kernels, three qian of Carthamus tinctorius, and two qian of Ligusticum chuanxiong (buy from a Chinese medicine shop). Boil them in water, to about half a washbasin, simmer thoroughly and wash the affected area while hot, once in the morning and once in the evening. Do not discard the herbs and water, you can boil and wash again. Wash it more than ten times, so that it does not ulcerate and the lumps disappear. After it disappears, take 1.5 qian of tangerine peel, 3 qian of raw Coix Seed, 1.5 qian of Polyporus umbellatus, and 1 qian of Pinellia ternata, and use the previous soup as a substitute for tea for three to five days. If you don't mind, you can take it for a few more days. After this, it will not be easy to suffer again. If you suffer again, still use the previous method. Washing and taking the medicine at most no more than three times, and it will never happen again. The principle is as follows: the washing formula is to unblock the meridians, activate the collaterals, and harmonize the blood vessels. The taking formula is to transform dampness without drying. It can be used regardless of whether it is cold or heat. The effect is extremely effective. Those who suffer from it can try it!</p>
<p>A Small Collection of Tonics</p>
<h3>Beef</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>Beef is mild in nature, bland and slightly sweet in taste, without rancidity, and rich in nutrients. It functions to strengthen the spleen and stomach, and increase strength. Extracting meat and boiling it into a paste, commonly known as Xia Tian Paste, that is, beef juice, warms and nourishes the spleen and stomach, and greatly tonifies the original qi. Its fat is sufficient to moisten dryness and relieve constipation; drinking it with milk can relieve heat toxins and tonify deficiency and fatigue, and also treat vomiting and dysphagia; eating it with bile brightens the eyes and can also treat traumatic injuries. When cooking beef, you can use chestnuts, dioscorea, or spinach, and eat it when it is extremely soft.</p>
<h3>Black Dates and Fructus Quisqualis can Eliminate Worm Accumulation</h3>
<p>— Ding Jimin</p>
<p>Children with worm accumulation are quite common, which is caused by accidentally eating food with worm eggs (so raw vegetables and fish should be cooked thoroughly, otherwise they may contain hatchable worm eggs). In the beginning, the abdomen is swollen and uncomfortable, digestion is poor, bowel movements are irregular, or fever and love to eat foreign objects, the body becomes increasingly thin, the face is yellow and the spirit is tired, irritable and uneasy, grinding teeth in sleep and other symptoms. Fructus Quisqualis (available at Chinese medicine shops, that is, Western medicine Santonin) can be inserted into black dates, steamed until cooked, and fed to children. Each child should eat five or six black dates at a time. Three or four hours after taking it, take another dose of mild laxative (convenient pills sold on the market are also available). Take it for two or three consecutive days to eliminate the worms completely. This method has been seen in European internal medicine, and it is also praised as the best anthelmintic in China. Fructus Quisqualis has been a sacred medicine for dispelling worms in China for thousands of years, and when combined with black dates, it also has the effect of harmonizing the stomach and calming the center.</p>
<h3>The Benefits and Drawbacks of Alcohol</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>It is customary to regard alcohol as a bad drink, but the function of alcohol is to relieve stagnation, eliminate hostility, and in traditional Chinese medicine processing methods, many drugs are stir-fried or boiled with alcohol, using the taste of alcohol to promote the medicinal power, and there are even those who wash, rinse, or decoct with alcohol. Therefore, alcohol is not without benefits to people. Alcohol has sweet, bitter, pungent, and sour tastes, and has excitatory and stimulating properties. Its nature is hot and its quality is wet. Elderly people take a small amount to relieve cold, strengthen courage, harmonize blood, nourish qi, open joints, and benefit meridians, all of which have special advantages. Other such as Eleutherococcus gracilistylus wine, tiger bone papaya wine, and Shefeng wine have considerable effects in treatment. However, drinking too much alcohol will definitely lead to drunkenness. After being drunk, one's actions are abnormal and it is easy to damage the brain. And abdominal distension, jaundice, rapid drinking, vomiting, thirst and other symptoms, there are many that are caused by drinking alcohol. For methods to sober up from drunkenness, there is Gegen flower sobering decoction, or decocting a thick juice of Cephalotaxus sinensis to pour down, or frequently taking clear soy sauce soup.</p>
<h3>How to Harmonize Flavors Talking about "Over-Medicine" Foods</h3>
<p>— Ni Xi</p>
<p>Nowadays, most people have some understanding of daily health maintenance, disease taboos, and post-disease conditioning items; however, very few people pay attention to the "over-medicine" path of taking medicine, which is actually closely related to the medicine force of the diseased body, with a great impact on the progress of the illness, so I will specifically put this point forward to talk about:</p>
<p>When people are sick and need to take decoction, it is unavoidable that it is bitter and difficult to swallow, and even if they see the medicine bowl, they will feel nauseous, so they have to borrow some palatable and flavorful things to adjust this bitter taste.</p>
<p>Ordinary people always think that the disease has medicinal power to resist, and for "over-medicine" items, they may be arbitrary, as long as they relieve the bitterness and refresh the mouth, who knows that if they encounter foods that have anti-pathological medicinal properties, then a big impact will occur, such as cold-dampness or damp-heat disease, the prescription uses dried ginger, Pinellia ternata, tangerine peel, or Atractylodes lancea, Magnolia officinalis, etc., although the mouth feels dry, it is appropriate to use light-flavored candies, or preserved tangerine peel with green salt, Buddha's hand and other products, if greedily eating raw and cold fruits, the spleen and stomach will be invaded by cold-dampness, I am afraid that not only will the medicinal power fail, but more vomiting and adverse reactions will occur. If it is a dryness-heat fire symptom, the prescription uses Scrophularia ningpoensis, Rehmannia glutinosa, Gypsum fibrosum, Anemarrhena asphodeloides and other flavors, then it is appropriate to use fruits and cool moisturizing products, if you like to eat spicy flavors or rich sweet things, the heat evil will linger, and the condition may increase and prolong. For example, if it is a weakness disease, the prescription uses ginseng, Astragalus membranaceus, Atractylodes macrocephala, Angelica sinensis and other flavors, it is appropriate to use candies, sweet warmth, or fragrant and other products, if because of disease habits and food taboos, still eating soy sauce, turnip, large-headed cabbage and other things, it is inevitable to eliminate the medicinal properties. For example, if it is a solid accumulation disease, the prescription uses Citrus aurantium, rhubarb, betel nut, Shen Qu and other flavors, it is appropriate to use strong tea, coffee sugar, fruit sugar and other products, if still eating cakes and pastries, sticky, smoked and roasted types, it is inevitable to increase the disease qi and reduce the medicinal power.</p>
<p>Therefore, "over-medicine" items have a great relationship with the medicine power of the diseased body, whether they are compatible or not. It can be divided into three categories: Sweet-flavored, such as candies, are suitable for mild cold symptoms, and all conditioning medicines. Salty-flavored, such as green salt olives, preserved tangerine peel, Buddha's hand, pepper salt peach slices and the like, are suitable for throat wind heat symptoms, and all qi-regulating medicines. Cooling and moisturizing, such as various fruits, are suitable for fire-heat dryness symptoms, and yin-nourishing medicines. But no matter what kind of decoction is taken, to require the medicinal properties to play quickly and the pathology to be completely unaffected, it is better to boil some bitter taste, take a sip and swallow it straight down, and then use a glass of plain boiled water, rinse your mouth two or three times, or drink one or two sips with it, which is the best way, otherwise, if you want to use "over-medicine", you also have to pay special attention.</p>
<h3>Changes in Symptoms and Dietary Procedures for Typhoid Fever (III)</h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>The changes in the symptoms of typhoid fever are as described above. The full text is not yet finished. Now I will talk about the dietary procedures. To summarize, it can be set as four standards: when there is heat, you must strictly abide by the word "hunger"; when the fever subsides, you must abide by the word "caution"; when you are greedy for food after recovery, you must abide by the word "moderation"; when you are weak and tired after recovery, you must abide by the word "nourishment".</p>
<p>During the period of typhoid fever with heat, you must be "hungry" for ten million. That typhoid fever can be cured is partly the responsibility of the doctor, and partly it depends on the patient being able to abide by this word "hunger". As the saying goes, "typhoid fever does not starve to death", that is to say, patients with typhoid fever should be hungry for a long time, and hunger for a long time will not lead to death. Do not worry that hunger and not eating will be a concern.</p>
<p>The source of typhoid fever lies in the stomach and intestines. To explain it with a simple reason, it can be pointed out that the heat of typhoid fever is due to the blockage in the intestines. The abdomen and intestinal parts are congested and inflamed, and the fullness is like "a section of sausage". If the evil congestion in the intestines is not cleared for a day, the cold and heat will not subside for a day. It is necessary to "use medicine to dredge; hunger to eliminate stagnation" before the cold and heat greatly reduce, and the disease situation begins to have hope of turning danger into safety.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you take food when you have a fever, it is tantamount to increasing the congestion in the intestines, making the intestinal inflammation worse, and the symptoms become increasingly profound. Ordinary people think that if you don't eat, you will be hungry, if you don't eat for three days, you will get sick, and if you don't eat for seven days, you will die. After ten days of cold and heat, people are always worried about not eating, and they want to give them food, even disobeying the doctor's advice and secretly giving them food. One of the most common reasons why some typhoid fever patients cannot be cured is this.</p>
<p>It must be known that during typhoid fever, the digestive function has stopped completely due to the congestion in the intestines. There is no need for food to supply consumption, so the patient does not feel hungry for a very long period of time. The length of time depends on the disease, and not eating for a month is very common.</p>
<p>Some may doubt that during the fever period, the body consumes a lot of physical strength, and prolonged hunger will inevitably cause the body to not be able to support itself. This doubt is always the source of death from typhoid fever. It must be known that during the fever period, if you enter a state of weakness and fatigue, the doctor's medicine already has nourishing medicines included in the prescription, why worry.

<h3>Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Theory: Chinese Diet Conforms to the Principles of Nutritional Therapy</h3>
<p>— Yao Ruoqin</p>
<p>I once read Kang Liede's "Sun Yat-sen and the Awakening of China," which stated that when Mr. Sun was eighteen years old, he studied at the Guangzhou Boji Hospital. In 1887, when the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese was established, he transferred to that college, studied diligently for five years, and graduated first in his class. He then established a hospital in Portuguese Macau and became very famous. This shows that Mr. Sun had a profound understanding of medicine. However, his ambition was to rejuvenate the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China. He initially did not want to be known as a doctor, so he single-mindedly devoted himself to the revolution and no longer used medicine to help the world.</p>
<p>Now, I have found a section of his writings, which I am eagerly transcribing to offer to readers, so that they can see that although Mr. Sun studied Western medicine, he still made great efforts to preserve the advantages of Chinese medicine, and he also highly praised the characteristics of Chinese diet. Ruoqin Zhi</p>
<p>In the modern evolution of Chinese civilization, we lag behind others in everything, but the progress in diet is still unmatched by civilized countries today. The foods invented in China are far more abundant than those in Europe and America, and the excellence of Chinese cooking is also unmatched by Europe and America. As for the Chinese people's dietary habits, they are no different from the latest theories invented by the most enlightened medical hygienists in Europe and America today.</p>
<p>Why do I say this? The inventions of Chinese food, such as the eight treasures mentioned in ancient times, are certainly not necessary for daily life. But even ordinary daily items, such as golden needles, wood ear, tofu, and bean sprouts, are excellent vegetarian foods, which many European and American countries do not even know are foods. As for meat, the Chinese consider the internal organs of livestock to be delicacies, while the British and Americans did not eat them in the past, but in recent years they have also come to regard them as delicacies. When I was in Guangzhou, I saw Westerners despise the Chinese for eating pig blood, considering it crude and barbaric. But now, after research by medical hygienists, it has been found that pig blood contains a particularly high amount of iron, making it a top-grade supplement. People with anemia, after childbirth, and all those with blood deficiency, who used to be treated with chemical iron supplements, are now all treated with pig blood. The iron contained in pig blood is organic iron, which is more suitable for the human body than inorganic chemical iron supplements. Therefore, pig blood as a food is not only good for people with illness to nourish their bodies, but also beneficial for healthy people to strengthen their bodies. The Chinese eating it is not only not crude and barbaric, but also highly scientific and hygienic. This is just one example of food. There are countless other foods that have existed in China since ancient times but are unknown to Westerners.</p>
<p>The enjoyment of pleasing the eyes and the sound of pleasing the ears are both arts. Why is the taste of pleasing the mouth not? Cooking is also one of the arts. The art of cooking in Western countries is best in France, and Western civilization is also highest in France; the art of cooking originates from civilization. The wonders of Chinese cooking are also sufficient to show the depth of civilized evolution. In the past, before China and the West had trade relations, Westerners only knew that France was the world leader in cooking. But once they tasted Chinese food, they all considered China to be the leader. In recent times, Mr. He was the first Westerner to travel to the interior of China. During the Daoguang and Xianfeng reigns of the Qing Dynasty, he secretly traveled to various provinces and reached Tibet. In his travelogue, he praised Chinese civilization in many ways, and believed that Chinese seasoning was the world leader. In recent years, the Chinese dietary style has been widely spread in places where overseas Chinese have arrived. In New York City, there are hundreds of Chinese restaurants. Almost every American city has a Chinese restaurant. Americans' love for Chinese food is so great that it has aroused the jealousy of local competitors. They fabricated rumors that the soy sauce used by the Chinese contained toxic substances that harmed health, leading the municipal government of Turin to consider banning the use of soy sauce by the Chinese. Later, after strict examination by medical hygienists, the result was that soy sauce not only did not contain toxic substances, but also contained a lot of meat extract, the quality of which was no different from beef juice. It was not only harmless to health, but also very beneficial to the body. Therefore, the ban was lifted.</p>
<p>The Chinese people's dietary habits are secretly in line with scientific hygiene, and it can be said that they are beyond the reach of ordinary people in other countries. What ordinary Chinese people drink is green tea, and what they eat extravagantly is plain rice, with vegetables and tofu added. These foods have been found by today's hygienists to be most beneficial to health. Therefore, people in remote areas of China who do not eat meat often live longer. The prosperity of China's population and the fact that the Chinese people's ability to resist disease is often great is also due to the fact that their diet secretly conforms to hygiene.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Six Nutritious Foods</h3>
<p>— Hu Xianglin</p>
<p>Every winter, people who are weak and prone to illness often consult doctors for supplements to aid recovery. However, "medicine is not as good as food," as the ancients have long taught. Here are several beneficial and harmless nutritious foods to introduce:</p>
<p>Chicken Juice Preparation: Remove the feathers, skin, bones, wings, head, and feet of a yellow hen. Place it in a porcelain jar, add a little wine, and simmer over a water bath. Drink only the juice. If you cook it yourself, there is often no standard for the heat, and it is easy to become chicken soup, which greatly reduces the effectiveness. Chicken juice made and sold by experts in the market is often taken, and it has a remarkable effect. It is better to change it for families that do not have dedicated people to pay attention to cooking.</p>
<p>Chicken juice is recognized by both Chinese and Western medicine as a supreme nutritious product. Eating chicken is very beneficial for lung diseases, and eating it after illness and childbirth is also greatly beneficial. (To be continued)</p>
<p>This issue's position has been expanded to one and a half pages. Reader's note</p>
<h3>Anemia Dietary Therapy</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zanchen</p>
<p>The symptoms of anemia are pale skin and mucous membranes, fatigue, and frequent headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, nausea, and other symptoms. The causes are mostly due to obstacles or reductions in the regeneration of red blood cells, as well as indigestion and insufficient nutrition. Treatment is difficult with drugs and blood transfusions, but prescriptions are not available to ordinary people, and blood transfusions are only used for large amounts of bleeding. For chronic anemia, dietary therapy is most appropriate. Here are a few foods that are beneficial for anemia, as a dietary therapy for the family.</p>
<p>Dietary therapy is the intake of foods containing large amounts of nutrients to supplement the insufficient blood components. In terms of efficacy, the liver is the best. Therefore, in recent years, Western drug companies have mostly made liver extracts into liniments and injections, which are strictly a kind of proprietary medicine. However, after many years of trial and testing in treatment, I have found that when encountering people with anemia, I often tell them to buy beef liver, chicken liver, or pork liver as ordinary dishes, which have a good effect. Because the liver does contain a large amount of nutrients.</p>
<p>Other plants such as spinach, soybeans, potatoes, cabbage, peanuts, dates, and grapes also contain a lot of iron and are rich in nourishing ingredients. It will be beneficial to eat them often at will, and it will be more beneficial than taking medicine for treatment!</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>— Hua Li</p>
<h3>Sects and Doctrines</h3>
<p>— Yang Jinhao</p>
<p>There are sects formed because of doctrines, and there are those who treat sects as doctrines.</p>
<p>Sects formed because of doctrines discuss, act, and argue in order to implement the doctrines they believe to be true. Therefore, in the process of discussion, action, and argument, the false, distorted, and evil elements of each sect may be exposed and overcome, and the true, upright, and good elements will be revealed and elevated. As a result, either all sects work together towards the clarified truth, or the sects against the truth disintegrate, while the sects conforming to the truth expand and develop. In the end, the sectarianism of the sects will eventually evolve into a group that is solely dedicated to the truth. At that time, there will be something to follow, but it will no longer be a sect.</p>
<p>Treating sects as doctrines, then their discussions, actions, and arguments will only focus on the sects on which their fame and fortune depend. They only want to use the monopoly of their sects to seek personal advancement. Therefore, in the process of discussion, action, and argument, they are completely controlled by selfish desires and completely lose their rationality. They do not ask about right and wrong, truth and falsehood, or good and evil. They only know how to fabricate rumors, slander, nitpick, and distort attacks against those who disagree with them, so that they cannot rise to prominence or fall into ruin. As for those of the same sect, they will praise and promote each other, help each other scold and fight, and protect each other, seeking to confuse people and occupy a dominant position. But since they treat sects as doctrines, they must also take individuals as the basis, so within the sects, there is also a struggle for fame, fortune, power, and position among comrades, so that whether facing outsiders or insiders, they often harbor suspicion, making them blush and arguing loudly, unable to explain a single principle.</p>
<p>Since the rise of our country's war of resistance movement, in order to achieve national unity and solidarity, many criticisms have been made of sects. Recently, the bad roots of sects of various parties and groups have indeed been eradicated a lot, but there are still some that continue to act strangely. This is because the first type of sect, formed because of doctrines, naturally dissolved its sectarianism and rushed to the war of resistance when it recognized that the war of resistance was the truth. But the second type of sect, which treats sects as doctrines, only seeks to monopolize advancement, and is bound to disregard the truth and despise the war of resistance, attempting to use the development of its sectarianism to eliminate dissidents. Once this kind of sect is attacked by the forces of justice, it will resort to any means and willingly become a foreign slave and traitor, dreaming of prolonging its life or even raising the status of the sect.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must continue to intensify and relentlessly criticize and eliminate the second type of sect, no matter which department it belongs to!</p>
<h3>Wildfire</h3>
<h3>Sending Gifts</h3>
<p>— Pin</p>
<p>January in the solar calendar is the season of winter. Although the sun hangs high in the sky, there is not a trace of warmth. The north wind is blowing furiously, as if to make things difficult for us. We are all wearing mismatched cloth gowns, groping and walking on this already faded embankment. Facing the piercing north wind, our bodies are trembling, but our mouths are still shouting loudly, "Joining the army is good, joining the army is good, getting up early, sleeping early..." We are cold, but no one stops, and we hurry to our destination.</p>
<p>We all grit our teeth, hold the boxes in our hands, and stare at the vast river in front of us. Seven or eight small boats are slowly rowing towards us, getting closer and closer, and finally they all stop. Lao Guan, that interesting brother, takes out a fishing net and puts it into the water as if something is going to happen. Then, each boat puts down a net. But while their hands are holding the net, their eyes are staring ahead, and their right hands are also holding the trigger. These seven fishing boats that have put down their nets, a group of country folks in mismatched cloth gowns, are leisurely swaying in the river, but who knows what is in their hearts?</p>
<p>The wind blows on the water, creating slight waves. The sun has also put away its smiling face and is slowly setting in the west. But the river is still very quiet. Not to mention that the boat sending us gifts is not coming, even ordinary civilian boats are rare. As one minute and one second pass by, we become anxious. We are gnawing on dry, hard biscuits, and although our eyes are still staring ahead, they are already a little tired. Could the information we got be wrong? We are all thinking this.</p>
<p>The sun has tilted further west, and it is about to get dark, when we finally see a string of boats sailing towards us in the distance. Our already numb nerves are jolted again. As the boats get closer and closer, we can see the people inside clearly: there are a total of five boats, with three men with guns and two compatriots on each boat. They are pushing and pulling the boats forward with tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>The five boats are only two hundred meters away from us. The seven small fishing boats take up their nets and scatter to the sides to welcome them. On the shore, the seven disguised country folks also hide themselves, and everything returns to silence. The wind is still blowing furiously, creating waves on the water.</p>
<p>The five boats are getting closer and closer: one hundred meters, no, fifty meters.</p>
<p>"Bang!" A fishing boat opens fire. Then, the seven small net boats close in from all sides. We on the shore open our eyes, shake off our spirits, and point our fingers at the triggers, waiting for the opportunity to come. "Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang," the continuous sound of gunfire makes this group of "X Army" panic. They rush to raise their guns, return fire, and then rush to shrink their heads towards the bow of the boat. Before long, the five boats are in a state of disarray. But the seven small net boats are getting closer and closer, and the gunfire is slowly thinning out. We look into the distance and see that some have fallen and some are raising their hands. The plainclothes brothers have rolled onto their big boats one by one.</p>
<p>"Don't shoot, tell them to surrender," comes a voice from afar. Judging from the voice, it is Captain Zhang. It is already dark.</p>
<p>Li Squad Leader's boat slowly approaches the shore. The flashlight signal gathers us. Jumping on the boat, we learn that we have only received a boatload of gifts. Another boat has sunk with the people. At the same time, we have captured three "X Army" soldiers who were sending gifts. By the time we return to camp, it is already dark.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we find a woman's photo next to a guy. Undoubtedly, this is the family member who is looking forward to his return, but now, they may not know that he has become a ghost under our guns.</p>
<p>Of the four boats of gifts, three boats are horse feed. We are very ashamed that we have no horses and can only sink the boats. The remaining boat has rice, salt, and congratulatory "Long Live Military Fortune" cigarettes. Although we were busy all day, we did not come back empty-handed.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Newspaper Industry</h3>
<p>— Yang Fei</p>
<p>——Reading "The Newspaper Industry in Modern China"</p>
<p>Newspapers have become an indispensable spiritual food for modern humans every day. Especially for high-level intellectuals, not reading the newspaper for a day is like missing a meal and feeling uncomfortable. Therefore, reading the newspaper is not only for entertainment, but mainly for enriching knowledge and absorbing spiritual nourishment.</p>
<p>In addition to reading the newspaper every day, if we can further explore the details of the newspaper industry, it can help us to understand the history of newspapers more deeply. It is just like people who love to read literary works often further study literary theory and creative experience, in order to be able to appreciate the content of the works more accurately.</p>
<p>"The Newspaper Industry in Modern China" (written by Zhao Junhao, sold by Shenbao Newspaper Office, priced at eight cents) is the latest published comprehensive book on the newspaper industry. It is not only suitable for those engaged in the newspaper industry to read, but also very suitable for those who study news knowledge to read.</p>
<p>This book has recently been reprinted. In addition to adding materials and rewriting the chapter "Wartime Interview" in the first edition, it also adds three chapters: "Newspaper Distribution," "Newspaper Management," and "News Legal System." It is said that the author has worked in the news industry for sixteen years, and has also held news lectures in several universities, and has published several newspapers and works. With his rich experience and profound knowledge, writing this book is naturally much better than similar books published in the past.</p>
<p>Now I will record the impressions after reading it carefully, selecting the main points:</p>
<p>The viewpoint is correct: He said that the elements of a newspaper are massization, education, modernization, and nationalization. The content of a newspaper... should take the interests of the masses as interests, and the right and wrong of the masses as right and wrong, and should not allow any private views to exist in it... The text should be valued for its simplicity, and the specialization should be based on conciseness... When selecting or editing manuscripts... good deeds should be publicized, and inferior descriptions should be reduced as much as possible... It should progress with the times, and should especially lead the masses to adapt to the times... On the one hand, the legacy of the old society should be eliminated, and on the other hand, it is necessary to strive for the mission of national independence and national integrity." These views, as well as the explanations on other theoretical and practical issues, are all very correct. Moreover, they are also applicable to other cultural departments.</p>
<p>Rich materials: All kinds of materials about the newspaper industry have been collected and discussed in this book. He uses the historical facts of the longitudinal evolution of the newspaper industry to demonstrate the various problems of the horizontal reform of the newspaper industry. Reading it makes people feel particularly appropriate and detailed, and full of interest. For example, the chapter "Improvement of Editing" is divided into five sections: "Editing Process," "Headline Research," "Interspersed Pictures," "Layout Innovation," and "Reference Materials." It is truly detailed and thorough. Especially articles such as "Wartime Interview," "New Broadcasting," and "Tabloids and Small Newspapers" have not been mentioned in other similar books. This book quotes many of the latest materials and inserts a lot of pictures with historical value. It can truly be said that it has come from behind and covered up all similar attempts.</p>
<p>Relevant to reality: In this book, in addition to the tracing of the history of the newspaper industry, the analysis of the situation, and the exposition of the theory, the most noteworthy thing is the actual revelation. It is not just a book for research, but a book that focuses on the practice of improving the newspaper industry. Among them, the various methods discussed in the chapters "Enrichment of Internal Research," "Improvement of Editing," "News Interview," and "Wartime Interview" are not only essential for news reporters to know in detail, but also should be understood by authors, and scholars in literature, history, social sciences, and other fields.</p>
<p>I think there must be many people who care about reading newspapers who always want to further study the newspaper industry in order to understand the causes and development of newspapers. Then, this book "The Newspaper Industry in Modern China" is the most worth reading.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that when the third edition of this book is published, it will add materials on "special newspapers" - such as children's newspapers, youth newspapers, industry and commerce newspapers, and national salvation newspapers - and "wall newspapers," so that this book can become a more complete "overview of the newspaper industry."</p>
<h3>The American WPA Art Movement (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>As for the location of the performances, the places are also very complex and numerous. In addition to ordinary theaters, awnings, schools, taverns, squares, etc. are used as performance places, and each group arranges and equips itself at the lowest cost.</p>
<p>The number of viewers in a year is estimated at 15 million, of which one-third are the viewing class that began with actual performances.</p>
<p>It must be said that FTP is a new movement in theater in terms of the form and experimental performances of new plays. They have tried to perform classical plays in a modern style, especially like the play "Settha" which was performed in modern costumes, which is very noteworthy.</p>
<p>The play "It Can't Happen Here" by Lewis and Sinclair has always been rejected by general commercial theaters, but through the relationship of FTA, it was performed in twenty-seven cities in the United States, with an audience of 300,000 people. In addition, there are many performances of famous works, which cannot be listed here one by one. Recently, it is also preparing to stage dramas related to American agricultural policy, labor, electricity, and other issues.</p>
<p>FWP and FMP Activities - Regarding the field of literature, each state is compiling reports based on multi-faceted investigations. According to what is already known, there is the "WPA Poets Selection" published by the Poetry Society and the New Series.</p>
<p>Of course, in the field of poetry, there is no direct relationship with the WPA's direct business. Some of these poets are the editors of the "Commercial Vernacular Dictionary" in WAP editing, some are consultants on black issues, or compilers of historical records, and supervisors of adult education, etc.</p>
<p>As for the field of music, according to the "Yearbook" music section published last year, the performances of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov" and other musical pieces under the direction of Jack Samuelsd in Los Angeles were very successful. In addition, works by Fordan and Wagner have also been performed, such as the "Sibiani" overture, E major symphony, etc., which lasted for three days. It is said to have achieved rare success.</p>
<p>The WAP art movement started in 1935, but in these short four years, this movement has developed from a simple unemployment relief movement to a cultural movement of the American federal government. This is of course due to the government's wise leadership and the assistance of the national treasury, but the efforts of American cultural figures are still the biggest factor in the success of this movement.</p>

<h3>Snow Cloud</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Snow · Blood</p>
<p>The snowdrift is scattered with spots of blood. Tonight, capturing last night's dream, I remember this scene.</p>
<p>The hand of memory searches more towards the past, revealing the curtain of childhood: after the snow cleared, I went to the forest with my third uncle to hunt wild rabbits. One shot hit, and bright red blood dripped on the snow. That scene is exactly the same as the dream scene last night.</p>
<p>Recalling these things, a burst of disappointment struck my heart like lightning. Ah, precious childhood, where did you flow to?</p>
<p>Is my third uncle, who lives on the Kanto prairie, still safe and sound? What is the fate of the hunting gun? Has my third uncle used it to hunt enemies? The motherland has been shaking for more than a year, what about Kanto? Are there gathered fighters in the mountains?</p>
<p>It is the season of snowflakes again. What is scattered on the snowdrift is no longer the blood of wild rabbits, but the blood of Guan Qi. Nourishing the frozen earth, it will sprout flowers of freedom and victory in the spring.</p>
<p>Sea · Cloud</p>
<p>The sea roared, shattering the calm moon on the sea. It hates the docile and obedient moon. The sea waves rolled, and the silver flowers were broken, as if to sink into the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Clouds rushed from an unknown distance, filling the sky, engulfing the moon. The earth was pitch black, covering the surging sea.</p>
<p>The night wind blew up the sorrow of the dark clouds, and wept - the heavy rain came.</p>
<p>The sky tore the lightning, and the bright light shone on the crazy sea. The waves seemed to want to destroy the world, and the earth shook.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the seventh anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu War of Resistance. All sectors of this city have decided to solemnly commemorate it in accordance with the measures stipulated by the Municipal Party Headquarters. The Japanese side fears attacks by guerrillas and has implemented security measures. The authorities of both concessions have also temporarily stepped up their defenses. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Citywide Flags at Half-Mast, Entertainment Suspended</p>
<p>All sectors of this city, considering that tomorrow is the seventh anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu War of Resistance, and at a time when the full-scale war of resistance has entered its second stage, will commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country and the compatriots who suffered. This will increase vigilance. Therefore, it has been decided to follow the commemorative measures stipulated by the Municipal Party Headquarters. All companies, shops, households, etc., in the city will fly flags at half-mast for one day. At 12 noon, everyone will stand silently in place for three minutes to express their grief. All entertainment venues in the city, including dance halls, Peking opera theaters, cinemas, and large and small amusement parks, will voluntarily close for one day to express condolences to the fallen soldiers and the compatriots who suffered, and to demonstrate the enthusiastic spirit of the people in the occupied areas in loving the country and supporting the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Charity Sales by Shops, Savings Donated</p>
<p>All major shops in this city are responding to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters' proposal for charity sales and donations. They will donate all the profits earned on that day to the bank and present them to the government for the purpose of providing relief to refugees. The implementation measures for this have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Currently, trade associations in various industries in this city are enthusiastically participating, and it is expected that the results of this donation will be astonishing.</p>
<p>Cultural Circles Donate 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cultural Circles Revitalization League has donated 2,000 yuan to the government for the seventh anniversary of the "January 28th" incident. The letter from the League to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the telegram to the Central Government are recorded as follows: (Letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters) Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters: We have read in the newspaper that your association has notified the public to hold a donation campaign on the anniversary of the January 28th War of Resistance to promote the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in our occupied areas, to deal a spiritual blow to the enemy, and to strive for the final victory of our war of resistance. The significance is profound, and we deeply admire it. Although our association was established not long ago, we are always mindful of resisting aggression and saving the country, and revitalizing the nation. We now respectfully donate 2,000 yuan, which has been entrusted to the bank to be remitted to the Central Government. We hereby inform you as a way to advocate and deeply hope that all sectors of the city will rise up together. Shanghai Cultural Circles Revitalization League (Telegram to the Central Government) To Chairman Lin of the Chongqing National Government and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission: On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the January 28th Songhu War of Resistance, the Shanghai Cultural Circles specially present 2,000 yuan to the government to comfort the soldiers fighting on the front lines. We respectfully ask for your acceptance. Shanghai Cultural Circles Revitalization League</p>
<p>Panic and Preparations by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>The Japanese puppet regime, fearing that the Chinese guerrillas would commemorate the war of resistance with practical actions, has been uneasy for days. The situation is quite panicky. They have increased the number of sentries in various places near the suburbs and are carefully guarding against attacks. Starting from the 25th, they have implemented a blockade of all ports on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. Small-wheel traffic on the Suzhou Creek and the Southern Huangpu River has also been completely blockaded. The section from Dongmen Road to the Dadatou Wharf has been closed to boat traffic since the 24th, and walking along the Huangpu River is also prohibited. Wooden signs with "Announcement" have been erected on the road. In other places, such as the Japanese military police garrison on Lincoln Road in western Shanghai, fearing that guerrillas would take the opportunity to intercept them, more than 100 Japanese military policemen were temporarily transferred from the Hongkou District to cooperate with the troops of Bei-gang Gui-xiong of the Yi-fu Class to take charge of the defense of Zhongshan Road, Caoxi Road, Hongqiao Road, Lincoln Road, Bailinan Road, and other areas in western Shanghai. Temporary posts have been set up at intersections and key points to check pedestrians. Two armored vehicles are parked on Zhongshan Road for patrol purposes. The vehicles are covered with branches and grass, and the Japanese soldiers have bundles of straw tied to their heads, fearing bombing by our air force. Therefore, only the Zhipingyin Bridge can pass between the border of the Nanshi area and western Shanghai. As for the refugee area of Nanshi, only the old school grounds on Danfeng Road can be accessed. The Republic Road is completely blocked. Only Japanese military personnel are allowed to enter and exit the Xin Kaihe area.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Stationed at Various Ports along the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Fearing attacks by guerrillas in various places, the Japanese side ordered all warships stationed in Shanghai to sail to various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River for defense, strictly searching all foreign merchant ships entering and leaving. Therefore, when foreign merchant ships sailing to various ports pass through the Wusongkou gate and the Jiangmian area in recent days, more than a dozen armed Japanese navy personnel board the ships for inspection. Japanese puppet troops are also jointly conducting emergency security measures at ports such as Xupu, Baimao, Shiyiwei Port, Dongjie Port, Beisha, and Qinglong Port to prevent attacks.</p>
<p>The Concession Authorities Implement Preventive Measures</p>
<p>The police authorities of both concessions, considering that tomorrow is the anniversary of "January 28th," have decided to temporarily implement security measures to prevent accidents within the concessions. They have increased the number of detectives and patrol cars patrolling the streets and checking suspicious pedestrians. The security measures are even stricter in areas bordering the Chinese-controlled areas, such as Caojiadu in western Shanghai and Xujiahui, in order to maintain the peace of the concessions.</p>
<h3>Confirmation of the Sinking of the Kai Po Wheel; All Crew Members Rescued</h3>
<p>The Accident Site Was Outside Haimen; Cargo Losses Reached More Than 500,000</p>
<p>The Kai Po wheel, chartered by the Ning Shao Commercial Company in this city from the Norwegian Hua Lun Shipping Company, has been confirmed to have sunk after hitting a reef in the Wai Diaoban waters near Haimen at 3:00 a.m. on the 24th. The loss of the ship and cargo is more than 500,000 yuan. All crew members escaped safely and arrived in Taiwan. They have already taken the Hai Fu transport ship to Shanghai and will arrive in port this afternoon. The details have been reported by the Xin Dai She reporter as follows:</p>
<p>Reef Collision Near Haimen Led to Sinking</p>
<p>The Kai Po wheel has a gross tonnage of 3,075 tons and was originally owned by the Hong Kong William Line. It was sold to the Norwegian Hua Lun Shipping Company at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Sichuan Road in Panama last November for more than 400,000 yuan. Recently, it was chartered by the Ning Shao Company on Duo-bo Road to run the Shanghai-Wenzhou-Ningbo line as a dedicated cargo ship. The ship loaded cotton yarn for the Ningbo Hefeng Yarn Factory on the morning of the 23rd of this month.</p>
<h3>The Crew Members Telegraphed that They Escaped Safely and Came to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the ship was a dedicated cargo ship, there were no brokers. The captain was a Norwegian named Olsen, who previously worked on the Tang Lu wheel of the Hua Mei Company. He was recently transferred to serve as the captain of the Kai Po and was employed by the Hua Lun Shipping Company. The Ning Shao Company sent representatives Zhou Yan Yi and Zhang Yunquan, the affairs manager, to handle affairs. After the accident, all crew members were rescued and escaped safely, taking a fishing boat to Haimen. The Hua Lun Company received a telegram from Captain Olsen in Hai Dou yesterday at 12:00 noon, reporting that "The Kai Po hit a reef at Sheteng at 2:30 a.m. on the 25th and the ship sank. The crew is safe." The Ning Shao Company also received a telegram from Affairs Manager Zhang yesterday, reporting that "The Kai Po wheel hit a reef and sank in the Wai Diaoban at 3:00 a.m. on the 24th. All crew members escaped safely and are now on the Hai Fu wheel returning to Shanghai in Haimen." According to the Xin Dai She reporter's investigation, the Hai Fu transport ship left Taiwan yesterday at noon and will arrive in port this afternoon. The detailed circumstances of the Kai Po accident will be clarified after the ship's owner reports upon arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Losses of Ship and Cargo Exceed 500,000</p>
<p>The Kai Po wheel is worth more than 400,000 yuan. This time, it loaded 2,561 tons of coal from Shanghai (according to reports, the ship had previously loaded 2,750 tons of coal), worth 100,000 yuan, for a total of more than 500,000 yuan. There were no other goods. The hull was insured for £15,000 by the Hua Lun Shipping Company with the British Royal Insurance Company's local representative, Renji Shipping Company. The cargo was insured for 120,000 yuan with the Siming Insurance Company. After the accident, the two companies notified their respective insurance companies. It is reported that the insurance companies have not yet received a report on the detailed circumstances of the accident. They need to wait for the ship's owner to return to Shanghai and inquire before sending personnel to investigate and survey in order to prepare for salvage efforts.</p>
<h3>British-Japanese Customs Agreement: Shanghai Banking Circles Deny Acceptance</h3>
<p>Rumors Abound in the Securities Market; Uniform Bonds All See Price Declines</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced that customs-guaranteed debts would no longer be allowed to be overdrawn and that the principal and interest of domestic public bonds would be repaid in Chongqing, the securities market in Shanghai has seen a decline in the prices of uniform bonds. Rumors have abounded in the market for days, causing the prices of all bonds to fall further. The market prices on January 15th and January 26th are recorded below. On January 16th, the uniform Class A bonds were 61.4 yuan, Class B bonds were 54.35 yuan, Class C bonds were 52.8 yuan, Class D bonds were 52 yuan, and Class E bonds were 52 yuan. On January 26th, the uniform Class A bonds were 55.55 yuan, Class B bonds were 48.65 yuan, Class C bonds were 47.5 yuan, Class D bonds were 46.5 yuan, and Class E bonds were 46.7 yuan. Comparing the two, there has been a uniform decline of 4 to 6 yuan. Regarding the rumors from Hong Kong that the Shanghai banking circles plan to telegraph the government to urge it to accept the British-Japanese Customs Agreement, the Xin Sheng She reporter interviewed a banking leader yesterday, who denied it. As for the customs duties in the occupied areas, such as Shanghai and Tianjin, they have long been transferred to the Yokohama Specie Bank. Although the British-Japanese Customs Agreement has been drafted, it has not yet been formally signed.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Items for Participation in the American Exposition Have Been Shipped</h3>
<p>Two Hundred and Fifty Crates of Handicrafts and Other Items; Jianghai Customs Exempts a Portion of the Tariffs</p>
<p>The first batch of items from local manufacturers participating in the American International Exposition was entrusted to the Changyu Company's Japanese Empress Wheel for shipment yesterday. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States at 11:30 a.m. today. The items to be shipped for participation include ivory, Hunan embroidery, silk fabrics, Du Jinsheng's brocades, Tianchu MSG, silks and satins, lama statues, lacquerware, handicrafts produced by Chinese national product manufacturers, small handicrafts, etc., totaling 250 crates. All national products to be participated in are intended for exhibition, and a portion is prepared for purchase by Americans. Therefore, the Jianghai Customs only collects tariffs on a portion of the items, and the other portion is exempt from tariffs. As for jadeite and jade articles, they will be shipped to the United States next time due to the delay in packing. They will be exhibited in the cement and steel-reinforced tower in "China Village" in the future to ensure safety. The Shanghai representatives are traveling to the United States on the Japanese Empress Wheel with the goods. The representatives from South China participating in the exposition, except for a few who have advanced to the United States, will board the ship when the Empress Wheel arrives in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Will Go North Tomorrow</h3>
<p>To Inspect the Condition of British Nationals in North China</p>
<p>British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, in order to inspect the current situation of British nationals in North China and handle necessary affairs, is scheduled to go north by ship on the 28th of this month (tomorrow), traveling to Tianjin and then to Ping. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in half a month, staying in Ping for at most one week. Other than this, there are no other tasks.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Denies Exclusion of Foreign Merchants in Hankou</h3>
<p>Says Relevant Denials Have Been Delivered to Foreign Embassies in Various Places</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that the rumors circulating in this city that foreign merchants in Hankou will have their shops closed by the Japanese authorities if they leave Hankou, and that the ban on foreign merchants transporting property and exporting goods will be lifted if they stay, have been denied by the Japanese military authorities. It is said that these denials have been delivered to foreign embassies by the Japanese authorities in South China.</p>
<h3>Japanese Laying Mines in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The Japanese military authorities recently reported to the foreign navigation industry that they had laid as many as 150 mines in the Pearl River basin last month, 10 of which were placed near Humen on Tuesday. A number of mines have also recently been laid in the Yangtze River area downstream of Hankou.</p>
<h3>Japanese Exporting Large Quantities of Rice</h3>
<p>The price of rice in this city has been increasing daily in the past week. According to rice industry sources, the reason for the high rice prices is that a certain party has recently been packaging large quantities for export. Rice produced in the guerrilla areas is completely controlled and transported by the Japanese, amounting to more than one million dan, so although the source has not been cut off, rice merchants have no way to purchase it. The concession authorities are paying close attention to this.</p>
<h3>Using Native Products to Replenish Foreign Exchange Funds; Flourishing Exports from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Successful Trade Control by the Ministry of Finance; Particularly Large Exports of Native Products Last Year</p>
<p>After the successful implementation of trade control by the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, it has been vigorously promoting the export of native products to replenish foreign exchange funds. The main native products concentrated and exported from Hong Kong in the entire year of 1938 were: (1) Tea: 239,099 metric tons, valued at 17,672,659 yuan. (2) Tung oil: 558,100 metric tons, valued at 30,960,669 yuan. (3) Piece goods valued at 12,691,994 yuan. (4) Mineral sands valued at 80,754,042 yuan.

<h3>Customs Officials Are Passionately Patriotic; The Integrity of Customs Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Retired Customs Officials Cannot Bear to Accept Foreign Exchange Profits; Import and Export Customs Declarations Have Not Been Changed to Use Japanese - Special Interview with This Newspaper</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, some customs offices in the north and south have fallen into special circumstances due to changes in the Chinese positions. The government is very concerned about customs sovereignty and administration and is planning improvements. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sovereignty and Administration Remain Intact</p>
<p>The Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Maze, handles all customs administration in accordance with the orders of the central government. Therefore, although some customs offices have special circumstances, sovereignty and administration remain intact. Previously, some customs officials, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, requested the Military Affairs Commission to rectify discipline in the customs offices and strive for efficiency. The Military Affairs Commission approved the request and handed it over to the Ministry of Finance for review. The customs authorities also believed that in the face of national crisis, civil servants should strive to be diligent, thrifty, and patriotic, and immediately ordered their subordinates to strictly comply.</p>
<p>Pension Funds Are All Changed to Purchase Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Customs officials are entitled to a pension, which is paid upon retirement, and the amount is considerable. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the customs authorities changed the practice of purchasing public bonds for the monthly pension savings of customs officials to purchasing foreign exchange. In the past year, due to the rise in foreign exchange rates, all officials who were due to receive retirement pensions received almost double the amount they would have received before the war due to the increase in prices after purchasing foreign exchange. However, this kind of foreign exchange gain is purely a wartime profit, and the retired customs officials believed that this profit would indirectly increase the country's foreign exchange expenditure. Many have submitted statements to the central government, stating that since they are national civil servants, and at a time when the war is ongoing and civil servants in various provinces are mostly paid reduced salaries, retired customs officials cannot bear to receive this additional benefit from foreign exchange. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance is investigating the opinions of retired customs officials and will make a decision on how to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Regulations on Housing Allowances Strictly Prohibit False Reporting</p>
<p>Customs officials are entitled to various allowances, such as rent subsidies, which are paid in addition to their monthly salaries. The regulations have always been very strict. Higher-level officials receive approximately 50 yuan per month, but it is based on actual expenses and reimbursement, with 50 yuan as the limit. Not long ago, a customs official reported a rent of 50 yuan for a residence that cost only 20 yuan. When the Inspector General learned of this, he ordered the official's dismissal for falsely reporting expenses and issued a notice to all customs offices to thoroughly investigate the rent subsidies of customs officials, ensuring accuracy and strictly prohibiting false reporting. If any false reporting is found, the official will be immediately dismissed.</p>
<p>The Number of Japanese Customs Officials Has Increased Significantly</p>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs duties were sent to the central government last July, they have not been remitted since. Inspector General Maze has reported this situation to the Ministry of Finance. Regarding the recent administrative situation of the customs office, the number of foreign employees of Japanese nationality has increased significantly, and this is mostly due to current needs. It is generally believed that this is a special situation for a short period, and that the situation will return to normal after some time. As for import and export customs declarations, Japanese merchants have recently requested that Japanese be added to the forms. The customs authorities have not considered this request because the declarations have always been in Chinese and English.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees in Harbin Forced to Serve the Japanese</h3>
<p>Forced to Provide Labor</p>
<p>According to Kaufmen, chairman of the Far Eastern Jewish Association protected by the Japanese, Jewish refugees who came to North China from Central Europe are now under the control of the Japanese. All Jewish refugees living in Harbin and other places in "Manchukuo" are forcibly organized into Jewish People's Associations to help the Japanese manage affairs in North China. Together with the White Russian Anti-Communist Alliance, they serve as the Japanese's pawns. The Jewish People's Association that will be used by them has been established in Harbin.</p>
<h3>Partnership Agreements Should Be Stamped</h3>
<p>After the abnormal development of commerce in this city, various forms of joint venture organizations have emerged in response to the times. The documents for these joint ventures are often hastily drafted and not stamped, failing to meet the legal requirements. As a result, occasional disputes can have a significant impact when litigated in court. It has been found that documents for joint ventures, regardless of whether they are called contracts, articles of association, agreements, stocks, salaries, or account books, should be stamped in accordance with Article 18 of the Stamp Tax Law Rate Table and the Temporary Measures of the Stamp Tax Law during the Emergency Period. Each document should be stamped at a rate of 4 fen per 100 yuan of the amount involved. Any excess amount less than 100 yuan should also be counted as 100 yuan. For example, a joint venture document for 5,550 yuan should be stamped with 2 yuan and 24 fen if there is only one general agreement document. If each person holds one copy, each copy held by each person should be stamped according to the amount of their investment. For example, if a joint venture of 5,550 yuan is invested by four people (A, B, C, and D), and there are four agreement documents, A invests 3,000 yuan, and their agreement document should be stamped with 1 yuan and 20 fen. B invests 2,200 yuan, and their agreement document should be stamped with 88 fen. C invests 200 yuan, and their agreement document should be stamped with 8 fen. D invests 150 yuan, and their agreement document should also be stamped with 8 fen. The total stamp duty for the four agreement documents should be 2 yuan and 24 fen. Stamping in accordance with the above method is legal.</p>
<h3>Orphanage for Refugee Children's Six-Year Education Plan</h3>
<p>Radio Fundraiser Launched Yesterday; Held at the Sino-Western Electric Company Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Association for Refugee Children in this city held a radio publicity meeting yesterday at the Guohua Radio Station to raise funds for the construction of orphanage buildings. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the orphanage's board of directors, delivered the opening speech, saying, "Listeners, today our orphanage is holding a radio publicity meeting on this station. The purpose is to raise funds for building orphanage buildings. We are deeply grateful to the entire Guangyu Society for mobilizing to come to our association to serve and plead for the orphans. Since the establishment of our orphanage, we have achieved today's results entirely thanks to the directors and adoptive benefactors. At the same time, we are grateful to the entertainment industry for their vigorous publicity and the generous donations from all sectors, which have allowed us to take in 200 orphans. However, the orphanage buildings are very small and the air is poor. All kinds of facilities, such as workshops, hospitals, and playgrounds, cannot be established. Therefore, we need complete orphanage buildings in order to complete our mission. Today, during the radio broadcast, we would like to ask everyone to continue to support us. As for the plan set by our orphanage, we have a six-year education slogan. During these six years, we will teach them to read and provide them with technical skills so that they will have the ability to be self-reliant and will not drift into a homeless situation after completing the six-year period. We hope that all listeners will fulfill their national duties and enthusiastically support us." Chen Jicheng and Zhou Bangjun also delivered speeches successively. The event will be held at the Sino-Western Electric Company starting at 12:00 noon today.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Salary Increase; Western Taxpayers Provide Information</h3>
<p>Business Community Representatives Investigative Committee; Mr. Seidel and Three Others Are Present</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that the Business Community Representatives Investigative Committee, investigating the Shanghai Municipal Council's salary increase, is working hard. A meeting will be held at 4:15 p.m. today (the 26th). Instead of diligently studying the documents provided by the Shanghai Municipal Council or listening to the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Personnel Committee, Western taxpayers such as Mr. Seidel and three others will be present to provide the committee with information that is not easily obtained from official documents and to elaborate on it. As for the business representatives, it is still unknown what kind of information they have obtained from other sources besides the information provided by the Bureau. However, they have not undertaken any arrangements to obtain contacts other than letters from other related parties. The Committee may give the Bureau's employees an opportunity to express their opinions, but no one knows for sure.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Telegraphed Shanghai to Commend Silver and Money Industries for Promoting Income Tax</h3>
<p>In order to Effectively Promote Increasing Tax Revenues; Strengthening Staff and Improving Tax Returns</p>
<p>Since the implementation of income tax in October of the 25th year, it has been very smooth due to the good tax system and fair burden. However, with the gradual expansion of the war zones, the assets of industrial and commercial enterprises have been destroyed, which will inevitably affect the micro-taxation of profit income. In order to effectively promote good taxes and increase tax revenues, the Ministry of Finance is strengthening the staff in the rear and improving tax returns, ordering all provinces to step up supervision and collection in order to enrich the national treasury. The Xin Sheng She reporter learned from the silver and money industries yesterday that since the fall of Shanghai, various banks and money shops have continued to deduct and pay income tax on behalf of the government to the designated agencies. The Shanghai Income Tax Office has received instructions from the Ministry to highly commend various banks and money shops for promoting income tax and has instructed the silver and money industries' association to inform its member banks and money shops.</p>
<h3>The Citizens' Group of the Relief Association Held a Team Leader Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Broadcasting Fundraiser Statistics Completed; Totaled More Than 160,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a general team leader meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association at 2:00 p.m. yesterday and reported the results of the first fundraising. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>A total of more than 300 people attended yesterday's general team leader meeting, including representatives from the association Xu Jilu, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, and team leaders Lin Kanghou and Wang Lianfang. First, Chairman Lin Kanghou reported, saying, "We are deeply grateful to the leaders from all sectors for their enthusiastic participation and joint efforts in the fundraising work of our association. The donations during the broadcast period have now been counted, and it has been determined that a total of 8,523 refugees have been adopted. The amount of donations received is 93,985.417 yuan, and the amount of donations outstanding is 74,944.50 yuan, for a total of 168,929.917 yuan."</p>
<h3>The Detention of Bandits by Japanese Troops: Four Bandits Escape Yesterday</h3>
<p>The failure to promptly return them to the police station led to this incident. The police authorities are planning appropriate responses.</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, the Public Concession Police Reserve Team, along with a large team of detectives from the General Police Station, went to a thatched shed near the 200-yard creek west of Columbia Road to search for bandits. At that time, both sides exchanged gunfire multiple times. Due to being outnumbered, the bandits abandoned their weapons in the creek and were captured. The bandits were then taken away by the Japanese military police and detained at the Japanese military police headquarters at 94 Jessfield Road. The next afternoon, the Japanese side handed them over to the Public Concession Police authorities for interrogation, with an agreement to return them to the Japanese side within 24 hours. After interrogating the bandits, the police learned that they had recently committed several serious crimes in the road-building area outside the western district of Shanghai, including an incident several weeks ago on Brenan Road where they attacked two Chinese police officers and seized their handguns. Later, based on their confessions, the police captured several of their accomplices in the Great Western Road and Jessfield Village area. Yesterday, the Japanese military police informed the Jing'an Temple Road police station that four of the bandits, who were detained at the "Great Road Police Headquarters Prison" at 92 Jessfield Road (next door to the Japanese military police headquarters), had suddenly escaped from prison on Wednesday morning. However, the details are still unknown. It is rumored that the police authorities are planning appropriate responses.</p>
<p>Discussion of Various Cases</p>
<p>It was decided that the Chairman of the Association, Xu Jilong, Secretary-General Yuan Lvdeng, and the main fundraiser, Fang Jiaobo, would successively give speeches and guidance. Then, various cases were discussed: (1) Establishing the organizational outline of the fundraising team; (2) Establishing the reward measures for the fundraising team; (3) Setting February 10th as the second deadline for payment; (4) Councilor Ying Yongyu's suggestion of a "One-Day Citizen Disaster Relief Movement" and Committee Member Zhu Qizhen's suggestion of adding a surcharge to telephone bills were both referred to the Standing Committee for deliberation.</p>
<p>Initial Payment Results</p>
<p>The association held its first payment collection yesterday, which was quite enthusiastic. The totals were: General Captain Lin Kanghou 2613 yuan, First Team 796 yuan, Second Team 600 yuan, Third Team 1702 yuan, Fourth Team 282 yuan, Fifth Team 124 yuan, Sixth Team 3325 yuan, Seventh Team 306 yuan, Eighth Team 322 yuan, Tenth Team 666 yuan, Eleventh Team 712 yuan, Twelfth Team 893 yuan, Thirteenth Team 2750 yuan, Fifteenth Team 300 yuan, Seventeenth Team 170 yuan, Eighteenth Team 948 yuan, Twentieth Team 30 yuan, Twenty-first Team 980 yuan, Twenty-third Team 500 yuan, Twenty-fourth Team 714 yuan, Twenty-fifth Team 402 yuan, Twenty-sixth Team 1200 yuan, Twenty-eighth Team 654 yuan, Thirtieth Team 10 yuan, Thirty-first Team 460 yuan, Thirty-third Team 214 yuan, Thirty-seventh Team 26 yuan, Thirty-eighth Team 300 yuan, Forty-fourth Team 240 yuan, Forty-sixth Team 200 yuan, Forty-eighth Team 824 yuan, Forty-ninth Team 78 yuan, Fifty-first Team 900 yuan, Fifty-third Team 524 yuan, Fifty-sixth Team 126 yuan, Fifty-ninth Team 200 yuan, Sixty-first Team 2106 yuan, Sixty-fourth Team 1772 yuan, Sixty-fifth Team 442 yuan, Sixty-sixth Team 70 yuan, Sixty-eighth Team 140 yuan, Sixty-ninth Team 24 yuan, Seventy-second Team 123 yuan, Seventy-eighth Team 0 yuan, Seventy-ninth Team 200 yuan, Eighty-seventh Team 50 yuan, Ninety-eighth Team 100 yuan, One Hundred Eleventh Team 24 yuan, One Hundred Twelfth Team 658 yuan, One Hundred Thirteenth Team 498 yuan, One Hundred Nineteenth Team 3600 yuan, One Hundred Twenty-first Team 134 yuan, One Hundred Twenty-second Team 2237 yuan. The total amount collected by all teams was 37,581 yuan.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Compatriots</p>
<p>The Shaoxing natives in Shanghai, in response to the invitation from the Disaster Relief Association's compatriots group to organize a fundraising association and participate in the work, specially convened a temporary meeting yesterday to discuss the organization of a fundraising team and begin the work. Liu Zhifang was immediately elected as the general captain, Tao Yichang and Huang Yantang as the deputy general captains, and Zhang Tianjue as the staff member to attend the association and participate in the work. In order to carry out fundraising separately, it was decided to form forty sub-teams, and Zhang Zonghan was immediately elected as the sub-team leader.</p>
<p>New Paradise</p>
<p>Li Ze, the deputy director of the compatriots group's fundraising committee, raised 110 yuan from the New New Company's Children's Amusement Park. This was because the amusement park held a purchase lottery last month and stipulated that half of the prize money would be transferred to the donation for disaster relief for children. The lottery has now ended, and the donation of 110 yuan has been submitted to the compatriots group.</p>
<p>Soliciting Cigarette Tins</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's compatriots group's light fundraising committee advocated the simple living disaster relief movement, it has been actively proceeding. In order to save waste and ensure that refugees receive more practical benefits, from now on, it is specifically soliciting donations of old cigarette tins from all walks of life, regardless of the quantity, are welcome. However, they must have a lid and not be damaged. Those who are enthusiastic to donate can send them directly to the office of the group at the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, 16 Longmen Road.</p>
<p>A Heartwarming Act</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Yaohai's father, a monk, was serving as a sailor in Ningbo and died in a shipwreck. Friends and relatives raised money to help Shen's mother for her livelihood. Now that Shen has become self-sufficient, his mother recently passed away, and he immediately transferred the remaining 326 yuan from the relief funds received from friends and relatives to the Disaster Relief Association to benefit the disaster victims. The association admired Shen's actions and has prepared a thank-you note.</p>
<h3>The Zhejiang Authorities Plan to Establish a Monopoly Bureau to Control Cargo Transportation on the Ou and Yong Rivers</h3>
<p>Encouraging and approving various ships to join the guild and selecting sailing dates to arrange the order.</p>
<p>Wenzhou and Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang are the only navigable ports after the war. The export of local products from the interior and the import of foreign goods are both transshipped through these two ports. The Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to establish a monopoly bureau to control cargo transportation and develop transportation efficiency. At the same time, it will carry out land-sea joint transportation with Jiangxi, Fujian, and Hunan provinces. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Sharp Increase in Cargo at Ningbo and Ou Ports</p>
<p>After the war, the cargo entering and leaving the ports of Wenzhou and Ningbo increased sharply. The original customs houses increased the number of customs officers to provide services, and the tax revenue increased accordingly. For example, last year the value of goods imported by Wenzhou Customs was 1,923,000 national currency, and the value of exported goods was 6,240,000 national currency. The value of goods imported by Ningbo Customs was 1,212,000 national currency, and the value of exported goods was 4,768,000 national currency. The increase in exports set a new record for the two customs houses. In the previous year, Ningbo Customs only exported 26,000 yuan, and Wenzhou Customs only exported 541,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Planning to Establish a Monopoly Bureau to Control Cargo Transportation</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, considering that Wenzhou and Ningbo have become important ports for the import and export of goods from various inland provinces, resulting in a limited number of ships, has led to a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Shipowners raise prices arbitrarily, and merchants feel particularly pained. Now, in order to regulate the social economy and dredge cargo transportation, the Department of Finance has planned to establish a monopoly bureau to control cargo transportation on the Ou and Yong Rivers, which can also increase provincial revenue and develop transportation efficiency.</p>
<p>Land-Sea Joint Transportation Has Been Implemented</p>
<p>Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Guangxi and other provinces have already implemented land-sea joint transportation. The highways of the above provinces have been interconnected. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been connected with the Yuehan Railway. The first section of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway has been completed and opened to traffic. Therefore, the main local products of various provinces are transported to Hong Kong or Shanghai, and the necessary imports of foreign goods are transshipped through the ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou. The Tenth Group Army Headquarters has approved various foreign ships to sail to Ningbo-Wenzhou Port and Ningbo-Wenzhou-Shanghai routes, aiming to promote the export of local products from the inland.</p>
<p>Shipping Guild Contributes Opinions</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shipping Guild has decided to petition military, police, and political organs, contribute opinions on navigation, and request adoption, so as not to hinder the military affairs of the war of resistance, and to seek the welfare of the people and shipping merchants. For the 48 foreign ships on the 17 routes approved by the General Headquarters, those who are not members of the guild are encouraged to join, and each should choose a sailing date to arrange the order of import and export.</p>
<h3>Japanese Motorboat Rams a Ferryboat on the Opposite Bank</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese motorboats sailing from the lower reaches of the Huangpu River to the south bank of the Huangpu River to supply the Japanese army with military supplies and provisions have been quite busy, indicating that the situation in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River is quite serious. At 8:20 yesterday morning, a Japanese wooden motorboat, No. 205, passed near the blockade line of the 16th Pier. Due to speeding, it suddenly rammed a ferryboat on Dongchang Road, capsizing the entire boat with eight passengers and two boatmen, all of whom fell into the river. Nearby boats rushed to the rescue, but due to the chaotic order, it is unknown whether there were any drowning deaths. The rescued people were all sent to Pudong, where they were frozen pale due to the cold weather. The Japanese boat that caused the disaster sped away towards the south bank of the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Economic Affairs Rewards the Invention of Electrical Wiring Boxes</h3>
<p>Invented by the Central Electromagnetic Factory, it can save one screw.</p>
<p>The Industrial Technology Review Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, based on the application submitted by Ren Guochang of the Central Porcelain Factory, requested a ten-year patent for the invention of various wiring boxes, round fuse boxes, and copper parts for other similar electrical materials. After review, the connecting part of the copper part and the porcelain part is crimped by a hand press with a wiring pliers tube. This method of crimping the copper tube can make one thing serve two purposes, saving a screw compared to ordinary screw connections. The structure is novel and practical, and a five-year patent is granted.</p>
<h3>1938 Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial Report (Continued)</h3>
<p>The annual index for miscellaneous items was 164.20, an increase of 27.5% compared to July (128.83). The monthly index was lowest in January (157.07) and highest in October (169.28). The annual index for food was 129.47, an increase of 27.3% compared to July (101.72). The monthly index was lowest in November (118.43) and highest in February (138.33). The annual index for clothing was 126.54, an increase of 12.4% compared to July (112.56). The monthly index was lowest in June (117.18) and highest in November (139.45). As for the total index for each month of 1938, it was lowest in May (154.49) and highest in August (167.12). The total annual index was 160.60, an increase of 46.7% compared to July (109.51). Therefore, the general cost of living, which cost one yuan in July before the war, now requires one yuan and forty-seven cents in 1938.</p>
<p>(4) (The Purchasing Power of Money in 1938) Although prices and the purchasing power of money have different names, they actually refer to the same problem, only viewed from two different aspects. When prices rise, the purchasing power of money falls; when prices fall, the purchasing power of money rises. Prices and the purchasing power of money are inversely proportional. This rises and that falls, and the trends are opposite. To give an example, if the total index of 109.51 in July 1937 (1926 equals 100) is used as a comparison standard, then the total index and its reciprocal should both be counted as 100 in that month. The total index of 160.60 in 1938 (1926 equals 100) should be counted as 146.65 (July 1937 equals 100), and its reciprocal is 68.19. 68.19 is the purchasing power of one yuan of national currency in 1938. In other words, the true value of one yuan of national currency in 1938 is only equal to six jiao, eight fen, one li and nine hao of the currency value in July 1937.</p>
<p>(5) (Retail Prices in 1938) Comparing the retail prices of individual commodities in 1938 with those in July 1937 before the war, the increase in rent was the largest. The increase was 163% for bungalows, 158% for Western-style buildings, and 143% for shikumen buildings. Among the fuel category, the price of charcoal increased by 118%, waste firewood by 100%, firewood by 96%, and coal briquettes by 77%. Among the food category, the increase in vegetables was the most drastic. Spinach increased by 247%, salted mustard greens by 174%, chives by 145%, green vegetables by 123%, and foreign potatoes by 106%. The increase in meat and eggs was slightly less, with beef increasing by 93%, chicken by 91%, and fresh duck eggs by 67%. Among soy products, tofu and dried tofu each increased by 48%. Among rice and flour products, indica rice increased by 26% and japonica rice by less than 10%. Among miscellaneous items, straw paper increased by 88%, yellow wine by 58%, and soap by 35%. Among clothing items, native cloth increased by 39%, striped cloth by 31%, and woolen cloth by 19%.</p>
<p>(6) (Wage Rates) The above table lists each industry according to the height of the hourly wage rate from 1930 to 1938. The wage figures for the shipbuilding and match industries in 1937 and 1938 are missing. After the August 13th Incident, the factories of these two industries were completely destroyed, and the few remaining were also in the war zone, so there was no way to investigate, and they had to be omitted. Among the industries, shipbuilding, printing, and machinery industries had the highest wages, with an average hourly wage rate of about one jiao. The wages of silk reeling and cotton spinning workers were the lowest, with an hourly wage rate of only three to four fen. Cotton spinning is the largest manufacturing industry in Shanghai, and wages are extremely meager.</p>
<p>Reordering the various industries according to the height of the monthly actual income, the shipbuilding, printing, and machinery industries still rank first, with monthly incomes ranging from 23.08 yuan to 47.63 yuan. The actual income of silk reeling and match workers is the lowest, ranging from 6.31 yuan to 11.39 yuan per month. With such low incomes, the hardship of life is evident even in peacetime.</p>

<h3>A Special Shanghai Feature: Retrospect and Prospect of Accounting Studies and Accounting Profession in China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pan Xulun</p>
<p>As for government accounting, after the establishment of the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) of the National Government, it promoted a detached accounting system. It successively established the Central Unified Accounting System and promulgated the Accounting Law. The central government agencies and provincial and municipal governments also gradually adopted new systems. Although the performance of implementation in various aspects still lacks areas that fail to fully meet expectations, the progress compared to the Beiyang Government era is incomparable. In terms of transportation, such as the revision of the telecommunications accounting system, the improvement of postal accounting, and the research on railway accounting, there have also been important advancements. Other items such as the national electrical and highway unified accounting systems drafted by the central competent authority have also played an important role in promoting accounting.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Xu Yongzuo's advocacy of improving Chinese-style bookkeeping has also had a considerable impact on the improvement of accounting in old-style commercial enterprises in China. In 1934, Mr. Xu Yongzuo believed that old-style businessmen in China who were not familiar with new-style bookkeeping found it difficult to change the concept of receipts and payments into the concept of debit and credit, and those who were accustomed to writing vertically with a brush found it difficult to change to writing horizontally with a pen. Therefore, he proposed to improve the old-style bookkeeping and apply it directly, instead of immediately changing Chinese-style bookkeeping to Western-style bookkeeping. Mr. Xu advocated that old-style stores wishing to change from old-style bookkeeping to new-style bookkeeping could find a shortcut. New-style manufacturers had better management methods than old-style manufacturers, and many secretaries and accounting personnel who were accustomed to applying old-style bookkeeping also followed suit, with considerable success.</p>
<p>As the use of new-style accounting became more and more widespread, the research of accounting studies became more and more in-depth. In the past ten years, the content of accounting translations has not been limited to bookkeeping and elementary accounting. There have been many good books on specialized accounting such as cost accounting, advanced accounting, auditing, analysis of settlement statements, and income tax accounting. Moreover, in the previous period, the work of compiling and translating accounting focused on introduction. In the recent ten years, because the application of accounting has become widespread and the experience has become rich, the relationship between academic research and practical work has become increasingly close. Accounting studies are no longer entirely imported goods. The so-called "Chinese Accounting Studies" is gradually taking shape, such as Mr. Yong Jiayuan's "On Chinese Government Accounting," Mr. Gu Zhun's "Bank Accounting," and my book "Accounting for Joint Stock Limited Companies" are all prominent examples. As for the book "Compilation of Accounting Terms and Translations" compiled by my firm's colleagues, a revised edition was published this year, which should not lack contribution to the unification of accounting terms in China.</p>

<h3>Uncle and Niece Sleeping Together: Husband Reports and Arrests</h3>
<p>Reportedly, the husband saw the money and allowed them to sleep together. A shameless couple sentenced to six months of imprisonment each.</p>
<p>Luo Suitu, a Shaoxing native who worked as a coal shop runner at No. 525 Henan Road, married a woman with the surname Shi from the same town. They originally lived in their hometown. In January of last year, people feared that the Japanese army would cross the river and invade Shaoxing, so they fled in droves. Luo's wife, Shi, then came to Shanghai with her cousin, Shi Yuande, from Shaoxing. Because Luo's income was low, the places he rented were all small. The room he currently rents at No. 4, Lane 60, Baker Road, is even</p>
<p>Only Has One Bed.</p>
<p>Yuande stayed at Luo's place, initially using a table as a bed. By last summer, because Luo stayed in the shop and did not often return home, Yuande took the opportunity to abandon the table and sleep in the bed with Shi. Luo only recently heard about this, so he suddenly returned home at dawn on the 24th and saw the uncle and niece sharing the same quilt. Ashamed and indignant, he was deeply concerned that publicizing it would affect his reputation, so he swallowed his anger and issued an eviction order. However, Yuande lingered and still</p>
<p>Slept Together as Uncle and Niece</p>
<p>The next morning at seven o'clock, Luo again caught them. Unable to tolerate it, he reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. The detective chief dispatched detectives to arrest the couple and found a love letter from Shi to Yuande. They were taken back to the police station for questioning. The two admitted to sleeping together without denying it. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Meng Tingke opened the court for preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the case and stated that the two defendants had already</p>
<p>Confessed to Cohabitation</p>
<p>For a year and that the plaintiff also knew about it early. Shi's letter to Yuande contained the words "If I don't see Yuande occasionally, I can't eat." Now, a public prosecution is filed based on the crime of adultery, and it should be heard and dealt with, etc. He also presented the letter as evidence. Subsequently, after questioning the defendants in court, Luo Shi stated, "I am now 30 years old. Yuande is my cousin. This time, we fled to Shanghai together from Shaoxing. My nephew stayed at my house. After July, my husband asked me to take a photo with Yuande and allowed Yuande to share the bed. From then on,</p>
<p>Three People Slept</p>
<p>on one bed. My husband also secretly instructed me to observe Yuande carefully and to observe his blood (blood is a euphemism for money). If others occasionally gossip, he would not listen to it," etc. Shi Yuande also confessed that the three of them had been sharing the bed since July. At that time, Suitu was ill, so I paid for all the rent and living expenses. Although my pocket is tight, the manager of Yi Da Qianzhuang is my teacher, and I have wealthy relatives in Shanghai. I can go to them for loans and help the Luo family if I can get it. Now, Luo knows that my</p>
<p>Finances Are Exhausted</p>
<p>And does not want to keep me, so he reported it." However, Luo Suitu firmly denied that he had approved of his wife and Shi Yuande's illicit behavior beforehand, saying that no husband in the world would order his wife to commit adultery with others and allow it without interfering. Judge Meng reviewed the confessions and immediately sentenced Luo Shi and Shi Yuande to six months of imprisonment each. If they were to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at three yuan per day.</p>
<h3>A Rōnin Causes Trouble on Trolleybus No. 18</h3>
<p>The driver's skill prevented a major disaster. Traffic was blocked, and the perpetrator was arrested and severely punished.</p>
<p>At around 8:00 PM last night, Trolleybus No. 154, operated by a French company, was traveling on Route 18 from Xieqiao to the North Railway Station. When it arrived at the Jialu Road stop on Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, the driver, Yin Denggao from Yancheng, opened the door as usual. At that time, a young man in a Western suit, about twenty years old, who looked like a Japanese and was drunk, got on the bus and stood on the platform. The ticket seller, No. 46, was selling third-class tickets, waiting for passengers to get on and off, and rang the bell to start the bus. It had only traveled a few steps when the young man in the Western suit suddenly ordered the driver to stop so that he could get off. The driver was not allowed to open the door according to the rules, and the distance between Jialu Road Station and Nanyang Bridge Station was very short, so he ignored it. Unexpectedly, the young man who looked like a Japanese punched the driver in the left eye, causing him to lose his line of sight. The front of the bus had already swerved to the south. Fortunately, the driver was experienced and braked suddenly, preventing a disaster. Only the trolley pole on the roof of the bus came off, and the passengers in the car were in an uproar. The driver argued with him, but he remained strong and unreasonable. Then, the patrolmen arrived and tried to use force. However, at that time, there were many trolleybuses and other vehicles on various routes coming and going, and the crowd of onlookers blocked the road. The bully, seeing that the situation was not good, shouted in broken Mandarin on the trolleybus platform, "I am not Japanese, I am Korean!" Soon, the police station's riot car team arrived after receiving the news, inquired about the situation, and took the perpetrator to the police station. Traffic resumed, but it had been stopped for a quarter of an hour.</p>
<h3>Tram Collision at Jiangxi Road and Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>Doors and windows were shattered, and two passengers were seriously injured.</p>
<p>At around 10:00 PM last night, a British-operated tram company's Route 17 trolleybus, traveling from North Sichuan Road, collided with a certain number tram at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Nanjing Road. Because the collision was very violent, the doors and windows of both vehicles were shattered, and several passengers in the cars were injured. The slightly injured passengers got out of the cars one after another and hired other vehicles to leave. Two passengers who were more seriously injured were called to an ambulance by Chinese police No. 285 and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The names of the injured were Wang Linbao (40 years old), a Ningbo native, injured in the waist, and a girl Wang Xiaoyang (8 years old), injured in the head. At that time, the two vehicles stopped in the middle of the road, and traffic was blocked for about ten minutes.</p>
<h3>Husband Fails a Grade; Young Wife Poisons Herself</h3>
<p>Persuasion Ineffective, Ultimately Despairing of Life</p>
<p>Zhu Guixian, a young woman from Ningbo, was nineteen years old and lived with her husband, Mr. Dong, at No. 6 Xiude Lane, Baike Road, in the Public Concession. Mr. Dong was studying at a certain school on Jing'an Temple Road. After class, he often fooled around outside and neglected his studies. Recently, the school authorities, due to his poor conduct and failing grades, made him repeat a grade. Previously, Zhu Guixian had kindly tried to persuade him, but Mr. Dong not only didn't listen but also spoke harshly to his wife. Afterwards, Zhu Guixian was depressed all day. Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, she suddenly had the thought of ending her life, swallowing a large amount of medicinal water to commit suicide. It wasn't until 11:00 PM that her family discovered it. They immediately rushed her to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, due to the extreme depth of the poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and she soon passed away. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Postman Steals and Opens Letters; Pilfering Checks Inside</h3>
<p>Arrested at Yi Yuan Dog Racing Track; Many Crimes Committed, Detained for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Shi Aigen, a native of Ningbo, resided at No. 13 Hongyun Lane, Aiduya Road. He was formerly postman No. 792 at the Kader Road branch of the Postal Administration. In July of last year, Shi suddenly left his post without permission and disappeared. After an investigation by Cha Peilin, the Postmaster of the Postal Administration, it was discovered that Shi had embezzled registered letters and legal tender inside. Therefore, in the July edition of the reports, the Xinzha Police Station was informed, who in turn requested the First Special Court to issue an arrest warrant.</p>
<p>A warrant was issued. Until 6:30 PM the day before yesterday, Chen Lianjing, a Chinese detective inspector from the Xinzha Police Station, and detective Huang Yulin, learned that Shi was currently inside the Yi Yuan dog racing track in the French Concession. They went together with detectives from the French Concession Police Station and arrested Shi Aigen, bringing him back to the police station for investigation. It was learned that Shi had embezzled 1,500 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>Ordered to be Detained</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First District Court. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stated the case, prosecuting him for occupational embezzlement under Article 336, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, stating that the defendant was a post office postman. On February 14th of last year, there was a registered letter from New York, USA, addressed to</p>
<p>Zeng Ji, Huhan Company</p>
<p>Tang Yonghua, containing 200 yuan in national currency. And on April 16th of last year, there was another registered letter from Korea addressed to Yu Dehan of the Zhengzhang Laundry Company at No. 720 Fuxu Road, containing 900 Hong Kong dollars. In total, 1,300 Shanghai dollars were privately opened by the defendant, who stole the checks inside.</p>
<p>Withdrawal and Spending</p>
<p>The defendant admitted to the above two cases and confessed to another case of 100 yuan and another of 50 yuan. However, according to postal authorities, the defendant's crimes were not limited to these. Therefore, they requested that the hearing be adjourned for further questioning. The judge questioned the defendant and ordered him to be detained pending further investigation and questioning in seven days.</p>
<h3>Transportation Company Manager Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Chen Guang, manager of the Hongda Transportation Company at No. 404 Tianjin Road, in the Public Concession, was nearing fifty years of age. Recently, due to a large deficit in the company's accounts and the imminent approach of the end of the year, he was unable to raise funds and felt ashamed to face the shareholders. He conceived the idea of ending his life. Suddenly, at around 3:30 AM yesterday, he secretly swallowed opium paste to commit suicide. When his colleagues discovered him, they quickly called for an ambulance and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Wealthy Family's Maid Steals Jewelry</h3>
<p>At the wealthy Xu family's home at No. 28, Lane 579, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai, there were two maids employed, one named A Jin and the other Yu Abao, both young. On the 21st of this month, the two maids suddenly left without reason. Later, after the lady of the house checked, she discovered that gold and jade bracelets kept in the dressing table drawer, as well as gold pearl, diamond, and jade rings, were all missing. Believing they had stolen and fled, she immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, requesting an investigation. The day before yesterday evening, Yu Abao, carrying her share of the stolen goods, intended to sell them at the Litianbao Silver Shop on Nanjing Road. The detectives investigated and arrested her immediately. Yesterday, she was escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Meng interrogated her. He ordered the stolen goods to be first returned to the owner, the defendant to be detained, and the hearing to be adjourned.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den's Outlandish Idea: Advertising for Gambling with Cloth Banners; Perpetrator Apprehended and Sentenced to Two Months</h3>
<p>The smoke and gambling areas created by special forces in West Shanghai have recently been strictly blockaded along their borders adjacent to the concession by the Public Concession Police Bureau. The smoke and gambling businesses have suffered a great blow as a result, with business greatly reduced. However, the smoke and gambling taxes paid to those who provide protection cannot be reduced. Therefore, some opium den owners have implemented the trick of delivering to the door to save addicts the trouble and to promote business. As for the gambling dens, in addition to increasing the number of card sharps, they even dared to post gambling advertisements in the streets. Initially, they were only posted near the gambling dens, but now they are gradually progressing to the concession area. The Shen Ji gambling den in Xinkang Lane, Jishifeier Road, is now adding a "copper treasure" department because the existing various gambling games are not enough to fully deceive. The day before yesterday, they wrote an advertisement on red paper and ordered their worker, Ni Zaichao, from Yangzhou, to paste it within the concession. When Ni pasted it on Kang Nuo Road, he was spotted by Chinese Constable No. 3130, who, together with the red paper strip, was arrested and taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Yesterday, the police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted Ni for the crime of soliciting gambling. After Judge Meng interrogated him and found the facts to be true, he sentenced Ni Zaichao to two months of imprisonment. If a fine is substituted, it is at the rate of three yuan per day. The advertising paper was confiscated.</p>
<h3>A Stranger in a Strange Land, Unable to Make a Living; Voluntarily Enters Prison to Live; Repeatedly Robs and Ultimately Sentenced to Three Months</h3>
<p>Chen Changgen, a native of Haimen, Jiangsu, is 28 years old this year. He previously served in the military and the 85th Division Staff in Jiangxi and Henan provinces. Recently, he was dismissed and came to Shanghai. Being a stranger in a strange land and unable to make a living, he had a whimsical idea of entering prison to live. A few days ago, he snatched hats from pedestrians in the streets of the French Concession, standing there without avoiding arrest. He was escorted to the Second Special Court. On the 24th, Judge Miao Qingbang tried him, considering that he had not previously been subject to criminal punishment, and sentenced him to two months of imprisonment, suspended for two years, and released him in court. Yuan Jiayan, the lawyer representing the French Concession Administrative Authority, felt sorry for his plight and gave him one yuan in legal tender, ordering him to go out and start a small business to make a living. However, after his release, only one night passed, and the one yuan had already been spent. Still unable to live, on the afternoon of the 25th, he again snatched a Western woman's leather bag on Julai Road and was arrested. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second District Court by the police station. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer representing the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated the case and prosecuted him according to law. When questioned, Chen confessed that he really had no way to make a living, had no relatives or friends to support him in Shanghai, and had no funds to return home. He was forced to break the law and requested legal action. After verification by Presiding Judge Liao, Chen Changgen was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for repeatedly robbing others of movable property.</p>
<h3>Prison Thieves Threaten and Extort Accomplices; Stemming from Unequal Distribution of Loot</h3>
<p>Yu Afu, a native of Ningbo, 28 years old, was arrested for theft and sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the Second Special Court. During the appeal period, he was held in the detention center. Now, Yu has submitted a statement to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Shen Ping (22 years old, from Shanghai, sentenced to six months for theft), an inmate in cell 960 of the detention center, and Xiaobaolin, an inmate in cell 15 of the Second Special Prison, namely Ye Amao (22 years old, from [omitted place], sentenced to fourteen years for robbery), of threatening and</p>
<p>Extorting Legal Tender</p>
<p>200 yuan, requesting a legal investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Miao Qingbang presided over the hearing of both parties in the Second Criminal Court. According to the plaintiff Yu Afu, on December 27th, Shen Ping came to my cell door and said that Xiaobaolin had asked him to bring a message to me, saying that he wanted to extort 200 yuan from me. On January 1st, Shen came again to urge me, and I said I would not give the money. Xiaobaolin wanted to "bite" me. I don't know either of them and request an investigation. Shen confessed that Yu Afu asked me to bring a message to Xiaobaolin, telling him</p>
<p>Not to Bite Him</p>
<p>And that he would have a proper way to reward Xiaobaolin. I didn't say anything about 200 yuan. Xiaobaolin confessed that Yu Afu's real name is Fan Jinrong, nicknamed Little Devil Afu. Before, I robbed on Aiduya Road at his instigation. Later, we split 20 yuan. All of our accomplices were arrested, but he alone escaped the net. So, I felt very uncomfortable and asked someone to inquire about his whereabouts. Now that he's in prison, I don't know. He asked Shen to bring a message to me, telling me not to bite him. I didn't extort 200 yuan from him. I've already written a letter to the police station to report it. Yu Afu further claimed that they</p>
<p>Denied It in Court</p>
<p>I reported it to the second section of the prison at the time. The section chief questioned them, and they all admitted it. Please investigate the testimony from the first section, and you will understand, etc. After verifying the confessions in court, the judge ordered that the records be obtained from the prison for review, and the hearing was adjourned to February 4th. Both parties were returned to custody. As for Yu's theft case, the appeal to the High Third Branch Court is scheduled to be heard at 3:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Silk Merchants from Zhenze Reach a Settlement in Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Shi Wenqing and Others Accused of False Accusation</p>
<p>Defendants Summoned Yesterday Failed to Appear</p>
<p>Nine silk merchants from Zhenze, including Zhencheng, Yutong, Zhengyan, Xiej, Ji, Yuxing, Zhentai, Yilixiang, and Guangchangcheng, have recently been mutually suing Shi Wenqing and others in the Civil and Criminal Courts of the First Special District Court. They have now peacefully resolved the matter outside of court, and both parties have withdrawn their lawsuits. However, in the case of Shi et al. suing Tu Junru et al. for defamation, Zhang Heqing was listed as a defendant. Because Zhang did not defame Shi Wenqing et al., he recently hired lawyer Qiu Hanping to submit a statement to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Shi Wenqing, Sun Xuchu, et al. of joint false accusation. The main points of his statement are roughly as follows: On January 7th, the plaintiff received summons No. 1 of the 28th year, Yi Zi, from the Criminal Court of Your Honorable Court, stating that the defendant Shi Wenqing et al. sued the plaintiff for spreading writings and defaming their reputation. I was greatly surprised. After investigation, the plaintiff did not spread writings in the name of the plaintiff or representing others or firms to defame the defendant's reputation. How could the defendants fabricate facts and falsely sue Your Honorable Court, intending to subject the plaintiff to criminal punishment? Fabricating facts clearly constitutes the crime of false accusation under Article 169, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. I request that you summon all defendants to court to be dealt with according to law. The court accepted the statement, and yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng opened the Third Criminal Court for questioning. The plaintiff Zhang Heqing arrived in court with his agent, lawyer Qiu Hanping, and stated the intent of the prosecution. Because the defendants Shi Wenqing, Sun Xuchu, et al. did not arrive, Judge Huang postponed the hearing and ordered the plaintiff to bring a warrant to summon the defendants to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Unemployed and Destitute Nephew Plots Robbery of Uncle with Gang</h3>
<p>Maid Reports to Police, All Apprehended Together; Confess to Borrowing Money, Deny Robbery</p>
<p>Rixin Sheng, a foreign goods and cotton cloth shop at No. 166 Fadama Road (Old North Gate Avenue), is owned by Chen Zhiguang (41 years old this year), a native of [omitted place], Zhejiang, and has been established for many years. Chen's residence is located at No. 27, Siming Lane, No. 425, intersection of Xiafei Road and Luban Road. Around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, four robbers suddenly broke into his home and robbed him. After the French General Patrol Police received the report, they immediately dispatched detectives to rush there, apprehended the four robbers, and brought them back for investigation. The details have been briefly recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The details are as follows: Chen Zhiguang has a nephew, Lu Keyi, namely Lu Mingde, 24 years old this year, a native of Jiaxing, who is also in the foreign goods business. Due to immoral conduct, he has been suspended</p>
<p>And is Still Unemployed.</p>
<p>He has repeatedly asked his uncle Chen Zhiguang to borrow money. Recently, Chen Zhiguang, unable to bear his nephew's harassment, sternly refused. Lu then harbored resentment. Recently, he associated with criminals, including Kong Ruian (28 years old), a native of Tianjin who was previously constable No. 805 in the French Police but was dismissed for misconduct, Zhou Jinzhang (28 years old), a native of Fengtian, and Zhu Zirong (21 years old) and Xu Liangwen (21 years old), both natives of Haiyan who are currently unemployed. The four of them gathered and discussed, ordering Kong et al. to go to Chen Zhiguang's house to rob him and divide the loot. So, the four, led by Kong, took a pistol and went to Chen Zhiguang's residence at No. 27, Siming Lane, on the afternoon of the 25th.</p>
<p>Knocking Open the Back Door,</p>
<p>They entered to rob. The maid Wang Sunshi saw them from upstairs and rushed to the balcony to call the lane guard. She immediately reported to the French Police by telephone. Inspectors Li Xianyang, Jiang Futian, Detective Inspectors Zhou Bingcheng, Xie Guangming, Detectives Chen Fusheng, Zhou Qingfang, etc. rushed there, apprehended the four robbers Kong, Zhou, Zhu, and Xu, confiscated the pistol, and brought them to the police station. They confessed that the instigator was Lu Keyi, who was</p>
<p>Waiting to Divide the Loot</p>
<p>In room 30 of the Rongfa Hotel in Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street. The detectives rushed there and arrested Lu and brought him to justice. Yesterday afternoon, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second District Court. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer representing the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated that the defendants requested a postponement of the robbery case for further investigation and questioning. Detective Chen Fusheng reported that yesterday, the defendants knocked on the back door of the victim's house. The maid Wang Sunshi answered and asked them what they wanted. The defendants falsely claimed to be sent by the Rixin Sheng store and had something to meet with the boss about. The maid opened the door and let the defendants in.</p>
<p>Going Upstairs,</p>
<p>She called the housewife, Chen Li (i.e., Chen Zhiguang's wife), to come downstairs. At that time, the first defendant, Kong Ruian, pulled out a pistol and threatened Li, demanding the keys. The third and fourth defendants, Zhu Zirong and Xu Liangwen, tore off a strip of bed sheet and tied up the hands of the victim's relative, Fang [omitted name]. At that time, the victim's maid, Wang Sunshi, saw it from upstairs and went to the balcony to call the lane guard and report to the police station. They went and apprehended the four defendants. According to their confessions, the instigator was the victim's nephew, Lu Keyi, so they</p>
<p>Arrested</p>
<p>Him. He also presented the pistol and white cloth strip as evidence. Then, Chen Li and Fang Yixuan, the victims, and Wang Sunshi, the maid, successively testified about the defendants' arrival, drawing guns, binding, threatening robbery, and reporting to the police. When questioned, the four defendants Kong, Xie, Zhu, and Xu, confessed that Lu Keyi asked us to go to his uncle to borrow money because he was sick. We considered it a robbery. Lu Keyi's confession was the same. Presiding Judge Liao verified the confessions and ordered the hearing to be adjourned to February 4th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>Young Man Commits Suicide Due to Love</p>
<p>Xu Huifang, a guest residing in room 416 on the fourth floor of the Yangzi Hotel on Hankou Road, 21 years old, committed suicide by swallowing medicinal water for unknown reasons.

<h3>News from the Gesthe Labor Transport Company</h3>
<p>Carrying Luggage for Customers, Passengers Alike Praise Its Convenience</p>
<p>Mr. Gesthe, a Portuguese merchant, and Mr. Liu Dakui, a prominent figure in the business community, considering that there was a lack of organization for the loading and unloading of passengers' goods and luggage at various ship docks, and that dockworkers often fought over carrying and overcharged passengers, felt that this bad habit, though long-standing, had become even more prevalent since the outbreak of the war, with the influx of refugees from the interior to Shanghai. Messrs. Gesthe and Liu believed that it was necessary to find a way to correct this in order to provide convenience to merchants and travelers and reduce unexpected losses. Therefore, Mr. Gesthe founded the Gesthe Labor Transport Company, with its office located in the Central Building on Nanjing Road, and Mr. Liu serving as the General Manager, with Mr. Cui Conglai as the Director of the Labor Transport Department. Its business scope has been approved by the Municipal Council, and it has been granted a special permit to handle all transportation matters at the various docks within the Public Concession. The company currently has dozens of workers, all of whom have undergone rigorous training and are required to wear numbered uniforms during service hours for easy identification. Since being assigned to work at various docks, the results have been quite good. The company is gradually improving, based on the purpose of serving the community. Although there is still resistance from various nefarious forces at the docks, the company's business is developing on the path of daily growth because merchants and travelers have generally praised its convenience.</p>
<h3>Remittances from Hankou to Shanghai: Remittance Business Has Been Restored</h3>
<p>However, There Are No Funds Available for Payment in Hankou,</p>
<p>So Remittances from Shanghai to Hankou Have Not Been Implemented</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings Remittance Bureau stopped issuing drafts to Hankou after the fall of Hankou last year. However, various postal items were restored one week later and transported by Japanese merchant ships on the Yangtze River. Due to transportation difficulties, there was no fixed date for sealing and dispatching. According to the New Voice News Agency's inquiry with the Shanghai Postal Savings Remittance Bureau yesterday, the Hankou-Shanghai remittance business has been restored, but only remittances from Hankou to Shanghai are allowed. Shanghai is still suspending the issuance of Hankou drafts because there are no funds available for payment in Hankou.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Police Narcotics Department Cracks Down on Two Opium Cases</h3>

The details are as follows: (1) At 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, an old man from Qidong, Zhu Xueli, 60 years old, carrying a wooden box and riding in a rickshaw, was traveling from west to east, passing Hankou Road Bund, intending to go to the dock and take a ship to Qidong. He was stopped and searched by detectives, who found eighty taels of opium hidden in the bottom of the wooden box. He was taken back to the police station. According to his confession, the opium was entrusted to him by Lu Chuanting, an opium trafficker from Caojiadu, to be transported to Qidong, promising him a reward of four yuan. (2) At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, the detectives learned that someone was secretly operating the sale of opium on behalf of opium merchants in Caojiadu in room 126 of the Zhenhua Hotel on Fuzhou Road. They rushed to arrest them and apprehended Bian Ziqing from Zhenjiang and Xu Guifu from Suzhou, seizing six taels of opium and 100 yuan in legal tender. According to their confessions, the main criminal was Li Mugen. Yesterday morning, these two cases were jointly escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First District Court. Police Officer Ru Bao[omitted character] prosecuted according to Articles 5 and 9 of the Anti-Smoking Law. After interrogation by Criminal Court President Tie Hongye, Bian Ziqing, Xu Guifu, and Zhu Xueli were sentenced to three months of imprisonment each for assisting in the sale of opium.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the representative of the Southern Hotel. We have noted that in the news section of the Shen Bao on the 26th of this month, there was a report stating that Wang Zhancheng, a shareholder of the Southern Hotel, was illegally detained and extorted by fellow villagers. It is feared that the statement claiming Wang Zhancheng to be a shareholder is incorrect. Our hotel has no shareholder by the name of Wang Zhancheng. In order to prevent the outside world from misunderstanding the truth, we have specially commissioned your esteemed lawyer to send a letter for correction.

<h3>Salted Pork Shop and Petty Traitor</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Zifan of Changshu, named Yuanqing, was intelligent from childhood and regarded as a prodigy. As a young man, he went abroad and was later selected by a certain Education Commissioner for the Jiangyin Nanjing Academy, where he was a top student. His mastery of classical scholarship and literary composition were admired. He was known for being unconventional, humorous, and witty, so his writings were also filled with jest, anger, and satire, all becoming art. Zifan was short and stout, with a voice as sharp as a woman's, but his speech was quick and clear. Every word he uttered made listeners burst into laughter, and many called him "Chatty Girl." His life's greatest love was women, so when he came to Shanghai, he spent every night in brothels and salted pork shops. When judging the charm of women, he always started with the skirt, and only a three-inch golden lotus foot would pass the mark; otherwise, beauty would be hard to display. He once served as a teacher (or dean) at the Chengzhong School in Shanghai, but his real intention was not in teaching but in enjoying the scenery. Zifan is now over sixty years old. At his fiftieth double birthday celebration, he wrote a couplet that was quite humorous, but unfortunately, I cannot recall the exact words. After August 13th, he became the head of the Changshu Self-Government Association. A friend, Mr. Jin, wrote a couplet to send him, which captured his self-composed style well. It is recorded below to amuse readers:</p>
<p>Opening his mouth, [obscenity], closing his mouth, [obscenity], sneaking into the salted pork shop, proclaiming himself a great Shanghai playboy.</p>
<p>Last year, resisting Japan, this year, flattering Japan, squeezing into the Self-Government Association, he can be considered a petty traitor of Yu Mountain.</p>
<p>Note: The three-square grid characters are words that Mr. Wu Zhihui often said. It is assumed that readers can guess them and do not need to spell them out. The brilliance of this couplet lies in the words "sneaking" and "squeezing," because this gentleman lost his footing the year before last and had difficulty walking. Moreover, his entry into the Self-Government Association was neither by public election nor by appointment, so if not squeezing, what else could it be?</p>
<h3>Mail Inspection and Postal Workers Protecting the Mail</h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>A friend, Mr. So-and-so, who works in the post office, was chatting with me, so I asked him about the recent developments regarding the Japanese inspection of mail and attempts to take over the post office. He told me many facts in great detail. Many people outside the post office are concerned about the situation, so I have written down his account below.</p>
<p>After the fall of Shanghai, the Japanese invoked the precedent of our government and demanded to inspect mail. Although the director, a Frenchman named Chaplain, tried to negotiate several times, it was ultimately ineffective. In early March of last year, under severe pressure from the Japanese, the various mail departments of the Shanghai General Post Office were moved from the temporary location on Yuyuan Road back to the original site on North Sichuan Road. Within a week, the Japanese sent inspectors to the post office. A total of twenty-one inspectors were sent, assigned to the departments of sealing, delivery, printing, registered mail, express mail, and foreign mail to carry out their work. The distribution of the twenty-one people was not very fixed, and they often rotated among the departments. Their working hours were from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, with two hours in between to go back to Hongkou for meals. They did not permanently reside in the post office.</p>
<p>For outgoing mail, almost all letters sent to government offices, parks, institutions, and newspapers in the mainland were intercepted. Private letters were rarely detained because it was impossible to check them one by one. Newspapers and periodicals were intercepted the most, especially various daily newspapers sent to the guerrilla areas, which rarely made it out. Even bags that had been sealed and were ready to be shipped were torn open and completely seized. Letters sent to foreign countries were not opened due to protests from British and American consuls, but printed materials could not escape their attention. The Millard's Review and the China Press were the most closely watched, and none were able to slip through. Later, they had to find other ways to deliver the mail, no longer through the post office.</p>
<p>Incoming mail was particularly scrutinized, especially those from foreign countries. Whenever foreign mail arrived, three or four inspectors would supervise, opening the bags and inspecting the contents carefully. All righteous books and newspapers were hard to escape. There was also an inspector specifically responsible for inspecting the mail of the Japanese themselves. When Japanese mail arrived, he would be extremely busy, carrying a list with the names of Japanese leftist elements for reference during inspection. Letters sent from Shanghai to Japan were also carefully reviewed by him, showing the strictness of the internal Japanese organization.</p>
<p>In addition to inspecting mail, they also undertook the task of detecting and monitoring the thoughts and actions of the employees in the bureau. They lured those with weak wills, investigated internal operating procedures, and did everything to pave the way for seizing the entire administration of the post office. Because of this special work, their attitude was particularly amiable, sometimes asking you to teach them how to pronounce a few Chinese characters, or persuading you to read Japanese, or even distorting the discussion of ideological issues with you. However, all the employees of the post office knew that behind this "polite" appearance hid unparalleled sinister intentions. They only dealt with them perfunctorily, silently, and coldly, and silence and coldness truly expressed their silent anger. And perfunctoriness revealed their helpless plight. Although a very small number of scoundrels took the opportunity to curry favor with the Japanese and learn Japanese, they could not escape the contempt and sanctions of their colleagues in the end.</p>
<p>After hearing the above, I felt very sad. Although the post office still maintained administrative integrity, like the customs, it was mostly controlled by the Japanese. Later, Mr. So-and-so spoke of the postal workers' firm protection of the mail, and I couldn't help but deeply admire them. On November 4th of last year, the five-colored puppet flag began to fly over the Jianghai Customs, supposedly to commemorate the establishment of the puppet "government." At that time, the post office also suffered the same pressure. It completely relied on the proper handling of the matter by the senior post office officials and the firm attitude of all the postal workers to maintain its integrity. November 10th was the date scheduled for the puppet "government" to take over the post office. The postal workers' union stated: "If you come to take over, at most we will give you an empty house." The Japanese and puppet authorities, in view of the glorious fighting history of the postal employees in the past and the complex international relations, finally gave up their hearts. After that, of course, conspiracies against the post office were endless. Therefore, all employees are even more united under the leadership of the union, vowing to defend the integrity of postal rights to the death.</p>
<h3>"Wings of the Navy"</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Men With Wings"</p>
<p>A Paramount Production Showing at the Nanjing Grand Theatre</p>
<p>In the past two months, we have seen three aviation films: "Test Pilot," "Flight Command," and this "Wings of the Navy." Coincidentally, these three works have something in common: a love triangle consisting of two close friends and a female character.</p>
<p>Forgive me for not having read a history of the development of airplanes in the past thirty years, but "Wings of the Navy" is said to chronicle the progress of airplanes over these thirty years, from the Wright brothers' invention of the airplane, through the fierce air battles of the European War, to the worldwide mail flights of today. How the "Wings of the Navy," directed by William Wellman, which is presented to us in a short one hundred minutes, differs in terms of chronology or narration from the history of airplane development, I do not have the ability to write ten thousand or eight thousand words to examine. I am very sorry and regretful about this.</p>
<p>Because "Wings of the Navy" starts with the Wright Brothers' first flight test in 1903 and continues to the successful testing of new bombers in 1938, with the love triangle of Pat, Scott, and Peggy running through these thirty years, the progress of the whole play inevitably feels dry.</p>
<p>The beginning of the film, depicting the childhood of Peggy, Pat, and Scott, is very lively. Their innocence when flying model airplanes; Lanson's successful airplane test, which unfortunately ended in a crash on the first flight; Peggy sitting blankly after the plane burned, Pat and Scott's long silence, and a secret kiss farewell, all portray the psychology of children very thoroughly.</p>
<p>After 1914, the story develops vertically, and the relationship between the three is only deeply impressed upon the audience in those three scenes. That is, after the end of the war, Pat and Peggy have a daughter, and Pat suddenly goes to Morocco to participate in the war. When Scott goes to visit her, Peggy asks, holding her child, "Where did he go?" "Morocco," Scott replies, Peggy slowly comes down the stairs and cries; when Pat returns, and when Scott finally reports Pat's death, the director uses the same lens. These three scenes are very brilliant, both in terms of composition and atmosphere.</p>
<p>This is a color film, and when the airplanes take off, the director seems to pay special attention to the harmony of the fading colors. The flight performances and air battles are all very beautiful.</p>
<h3>"Beware of Fire"</h3>
<p>— Dong Guo</p>
<p>"Tock tock...tock tock"</p>
<p>It is the sound of knocking bamboo, carried over in the silent night sky by the wind blowing against my house. The sound is so faint, gradually becoming heavy!</p>
<p>"Tock tock...Beware of fire...tock tock...Close the front door..." Every year, when I hear this sound, I think: - This world is cruel, more cruel than the wind in December: there is selfishness and self-interest between people. In this way, I felt the greatness of the "Beware of Fire" caller, he - although he said he was doing it for some meager rewards, he had a passion that others did not, under the cold night sky, without anyone urging him, he circled around the various neighborhoods, knocking and shouting, again and again, until the sky revealed dawn. He makes us pay attention to whether there are any small fires that could start a prairie fire, and he also drives away the thieves digging holes in the back door.</p>
<p>"Tock tock...Prop up the back door...tock tock...Cold winter month..." The sound is faint again, it should be going far away!</p>
<p>Yes, I admire and sympathize with the "Beware of Fire" caller very much, and I would feel so sad for him that I almost shed tears. It was the first time I saw his aging appearance, during the day, when he was going door to door asking for some meager rewards. I saw that his hair was already very white, his eyelids were drooping, unable to distinguish the black and white of his pupils, and his back had long been bent flat to his waist: carrying a bamboo tube, carrying a lantern with the word "fire" written upside down, shivering, tears constantly flowing to his beard.</p>
<p>"Tock tock...Sir"!</p>
<p>People impatiently gave him two copper coins, and he walked away gratefully.</p>
<p>"He has been calling 'Beware of Fire' for twenty or thirty years. The earliest time I saw him, he was still young! Now, looking at him, I'm afraid he won't live much longer"! Someone said to me.</p>
<p>Twenty or thirty years, what a long sentence! From youth to old age, his life must have been full of pain and misfortune. Yes, I also believe that he will die soon, and he must die very miserably, perhaps with no one to collect his bones. Humanity is always so cruel!</p>
<p>However, I remember very clearly that he was still alive in a winter before August 13th, and he was still calling "Beware of Fire". But where is he now? Blasted into mud by artillery fire? Trampled to pieces under the feet of fleeing crowds? Or starving to death in a dilapidated house?...A tragic image of an old man's corpse appeared in my mind, and I couldn't think further.</p>
<p>"Tock tock...tock tock..." The sound is closer again.</p>
<p>Is he that old man? No! He is another old man, I remember, he is also a poor old man. "Tock...Beware of fire...cough cough"</p>
<p>Hearing the suffocating cough, I knew that he was struggling with the fierce north wind, and I seemed to see him embarking on the path of death like the previous old man.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 2: Engineer Lin Cleverly Explains Standardization, Director Jin Eloquently Discusses Equality</p>
<p>Lin Jiancheng said, "Speaking of the petty cash issue, it's a kind of bad habit. Why is there petty cash in addition to the main accounts?" According to the older generation, China once vigorously promoted the New Life Movement, wanting to abolish that kind of petty cash, but they couldn't abolish it no matter what. In addition to petty cash, there's also extra petty cash, and even petty cash exceeding the main accounts. This isn't just in China; it's the same in foreign countries. Among them, England is relatively better; France is the most severe. Every move requires petty cash. Especially in entertainment and dining places, if you don't give them petty cash, their faces will change. Therefore, people call it the 'Country of Petty Cash.' In fact, honestly speaking, petty cash is 'public bribery.' It's really not easy for us to abolish the petty cash system now." Jin Danyu said, "This comes from the class system; it's unavoidable. What's called petty cash was previously called tips, meaning you served me attentively, and the master would reward you with some money. Later, it became indispensable, a mandatory petty cash, and the poor became poorer, and the rich became richer. The poor then begged for the leftovers from the rich, and the rich bought the favor of the poor. This is how petty cash formed. So, China once wanted to abolish petty cash, but I said it was dealing with the symptoms without addressing the root cause." For example, in a society with a steep class system, it's not easy to achieve equality. I also heard an old gentleman say that in the Qing Dynasty, servants addressed their masters as 'Master' or 'Lord.' After the revolution, they were no longer allowed to use these titles and were changed to 'Mr.' However, what happened after they were called 'Mr.'? The master-servant relationship remained the same! Especially in our female circles, concubines and prostitutes are still prevalent! What equality are we talking about? Changing the titles, is that considered equality? So, you say it's not easy to abolish the petty cash system; I say it's extremely easy. As long as everyone knows equality, everyone knows that taking petty cash is shameful, everyone knows that besides what I should take, I don't need to ask for petty cash, then petty cash will naturally abolish itself. The various affairs in the world are shared by various people, and there shouldn't be a distinction between noble and lowly occupations. Now, our new China is striving to move in that direction. Just like my little sister Wang Jing, she works as a waitress here. Does she lose her personality? Does she make us lose our respect? She laughed and said, 'Sister Danyu! You're talking about me again. I can hear you, what little sister Wang Jing...' Lin Jiancheng said, 'She's not talking about you; she's giving a grand speech here. It's a pity you came late; otherwise, you could have heard a speech.'" (23)</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese War Newsreel: The Mother of Guerrillas, Old Mrs. Zhao, on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>Scolding her son to strive for the country, with tears and sobs. Her son, Zhao Tong, also gives a speech.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Zhao, "The Mother of Guerrillas," is the mother of Mr. Zhao Tong, the leader of the North China Guerrillas. People call her the mother of our Chinese nation. In North China, she led hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers, launching guerrilla warfare, entering the enemy's rear, and launching surprise attacks to avoid the enemy's strengths and attack their weaknesses. She had already established many meritorious deeds, causing the enemies to be terrified.</p>
<p>Although she is an old woman approaching seventy years old, her brave and strong fighting spirit does not yield to that of young people. Not long ago, she and Mr. Zhao Tong both went from North China to Hong Kong, both with important missions. Recently, Mrs. Zhao finished her business in Hong Kong and went to Singapore to carry out propaganda work. Mr. Zhao Tong will also return to the front lines in the next few days to command the brave soldiers in North China to fight. On the 24th of last month, before she departed by boat, Mr. Li Gongke, the Hong Kong representative of the Central Photography Studio, not only filmed the real scene of Old Mrs. Zhao leaving Hong Kong for Singapore at the wharf, but also invited her and her son to the Nanyue Photography Studio in advance to shoot several sound clips of her scolding her son. First, a medium shot of Old Mrs. Zhao and Mr. Zhao Tong standing together was filmed. Old Mrs. Zhao said to him: "I am now going to Singapore to do propaganda for the overseas Chinese. When you return to the front, you must strive for the victory of our resistance against Japan. We must adhere to the spirit of resisting Japan to the end, and not be discouraged halfway. You go ahead and work hard, and don't worry about your parents. If you have a sincere heart to be filial to your parents, then be filial to the country. Being filial to the country is being filial to your parents. Now I am going! You must work hard. If you do not be filial to the country and cannot fulfill your responsibilities, then you are not my son, and I am not considered your mother." When she said the last few sentences, her voice and expression were particularly poignant, and she couldn't help but burst into tears. The people who were visiting were also greatly moved, and everyone couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>After shooting a close-up of Mrs. Zhao, they continued to shoot Mr. Zhao Tong's reply to his mother: "Mother, please rest assured, your son will never forget your teachings. Your son will use his past spirit to kill the enemy, kill all the enemies on our land, and fight back to our hometown. Absolutely resist Japan to the end, support our highest leader, and strive for the independence, freedom, and happiness of our Republic of China."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Zhao Tong's speech on the guerrillas was filmed, mainly saying: "The guerrillas prevent the enemy from being able to rest in the occupied areas, dispersing their forces, making the enemy exhausted, and giving considerable assistance to the regular army. At the same time, I hope that the guerrillas in South China and the guerrillas in North China can communicate with each other, exert greater efficiency, and kill all the enemies as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The film is over five hundred feet long and is prepared to be shown in theaters in the mainland as a newsreel. Fellow countrymen who admire Mrs. Zhao and Mr. Zhao can admire their demeanor and listen to their patriotic speeches on the silver screen. In this way, the effectiveness it will have in terms of anti-Japanese propaganda is obviously unusual; it is just that we, the masses trapped on this isolated island, are eager to see it, but we have no chance to see this film for the time being.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Shanghai Bank Employees' Peking Opera Society</h3>
<p>— Quechang</p>
<p>Last Friday, through the introduction of a friend, I made a visit to the "Shanghai Bank Employees' Peking Opera Society" at Building 190 Renji Road, No. 75 in the inner building. I am writing it down specifically: The society was established in 1929. The bank authorities, because this is a legitimate form of entertainment for employees in their spare time, are willing to strongly promote it and provide monthly subsidies. Since the society does not feel economically difficult, it is naturally easier to handle affairs, and the achievements are remarkable. After January 28th, the market became increasingly depressed, and the society was implicitly disbanded. In February of the year before last, they felt that the social economy had been revived and all industries were flourishing, and it was still necessary for colleagues to adjust their fatigue in their spare time, so they asked the authorities to revive the banner. After the revival, they only sang for two private performances and one dress rehearsal, and the bad news of the July 7th Incident spread to Shanghai. The society also temporarily stopped because of this. Now that Shanghai is flourishing in a special environment, the colleagues of the society, in their distress, have again negotiated the consent of the authorities, and on December 1st of last year, they reorganized the society. There are now fifty or sixty members. Their ambition is to succeed in creating a completely amateur acting troupe. All the main characters, supporting roles, extras, and scenes are all performed by the members themselves, without relying on professionals. The society already has three teachers, and they also want to find two more teachers to teach martial arts and clown roles. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day is their time for rehearsing, vocalizing, and learning opera. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday is the day for implementing sound rehearsals. Their sound rehearsals are arranged by the opera affairs department according to the level of learning of each member, so that everyone has the opportunity to have a sound rehearsal. This method is very helpful for beginners. Now, except for the drummer and the musician, who are still professionals, the other percussion instruments are already played entirely by the members. There are many people learning stage management, and there are also one or two learning the erhu. Even the small supporting roles (sweeping-edge old men, etc.) and the extra learners are not unwilling to learn because they are small roles. Recently, they have also slightly renovated the original house, adding a stage and installing several follow spotlights. This kind of equipment is still seen for the first time in various amateur acting troupes in Shanghai! I am writing this article not to promote them. My motive is as follows: (1) The society has received the promotion of the bank authorities, which shows the authorities' emphasis on the employees' spare time entertainment, and they give some comfort to the colleagues, which is worthy of praise; (2) The organization of the society is very sound, the facilities are very complete, which is absolutely different from the situation of other acting troupes; (3) The society's ambition is very great. Originally, extra runners, small supporting roles, and stage management are all part of the art, and should not be neglected just because they cannot be in the spotlight. The society is willing to put effort into these small places, and if they can succeed in the future, it can be regarded as the society's honor and a good story in the amateur acting world.</p>

<h3>Singing Girl Training School</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>In the film city, almost every film production company has a singing girl training school attached to it. Among them, the 20th Century Fox company has the largest scale, with an annual budget of 850,000 US dollars. Currently, the school has 500 students. In addition to providing them with room and board, the school also provides them with weekly remuneration ranging from 35 to 150 US dollars. Those who participate in performances in films also receive additional remuneration, just like temporary actors. Many of these singing girls are graduates of universities or specialized schools. They hope to become a big star (those with excellent grades after graduation are listed as actors of the company), so they are willing to undergo a year and six months of training at the school. This kind of singing girl school is called "Beautiful Legs School" by Americans. Because one of the standard qualifications for the school to select students is: "Are your thighs beautiful"!</p>
<h3>The Female Prisoner Escorted in the Golden Theater's Charity Performance</h3>
<p>— The</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Zijingbo is a native of Xinghua, Jiangsu Province. He has been doing business in Shanghai for many years. He is elegant and handsome, and enjoys making friends. He is especially enthusiastic about social charity events. In his spare time, he dabbles in opera, and is skilled in both Qingyi and Huashan roles! He has performed "Princess Visiting Her Mother" and "Yan Jiao of Wulongyuan" in the Golden Theater's charity performances and Ping She's private performances. His performance has been fairly well received. Recently (on the evening of the 24th), he once again spoke out for the refugees, and guest-starred as the female prisoner in "The Female Prisoner Escorted" at the Golden Theater. His voice was even more robust than before. The long sections of "fan diao" (reversed melody) and "xing lu liu shui" (flowing melody of the road) were sung in the style of Mr. Mou Yanqiu, and were very stable. In terms of body movements, after being instructed by the famous actress Jin Biyan, there was also visible progress. Furthermore, Sun Lanting played the escort, which added a lot of color to the play. Mr. Huang has only been dabbling in opera for less than two years, and he has already achieved such results, which is gratifying. The published picture is his recent photo.</p>

<h3>Chess World</h3>
<p>— Edited by Bao Zibo, Revised by Lu Chengzu</p>
<p>Opening Strategy - Eighth Game</p>
<p>Black Moves First</p>
<p>Screen Horse Against Central Cannon (Patrolling River Chariot Method)</p>
<p>Move follows the seventh game</p>
<p>Chariot 3 Advances 2, Changing to Chariot 3 Retreats 1, Horse 3 Advances 4, Horse 8 Advances 9, Horse 7 Advances 6</p>
<p>Cannon 5 Advances 4, Cannon 3 Moves Sideways to 5, Cannon 7 Moves Sideways to 5</p>
<p>(Explanation) Chariot 2 Advances 4, is a standard move, different from Advancing 6. Pawn 7 Advances 1, is the intention of Chariot 2 Advancing 4, targeting the pawn, the purpose is to dissolve the opponent's defensive work. Chariot 2 Moves Sideways to 7, patrolling the river chariot's role, is to control the opponent's pawn and horse's path of advancement. Cannon 2 Retreats 1, preparing to open up the black side's seventh file chariot, so as not to occupy the strategic pass, which can both cover the horse's steps, and can supplement the elephant's position. Cannon 8 Moves Sideways to 7, should capture the chariot, Chariot 7 Moves Sideways to 3 to concede, compete for the cannon to move first, Pawn 7 Advances 1, a dangerous move, Chariot 3 Advances 1 forces the elephant to leave, then it will lose the initiative. Elephant 3 Advances 5, is the intention of Pawn 7 Advancing 1. Chariot 3 Advances 2 to remove the horse, advancing at the risk. Horse 3 Retreats 5 to capture the chariot. At this time, although the black side loses a chariot, there is still much to be done, and the victory or defeat is undecided. The mysteries will be published in detail in the variations of various opening strategies.</p>
<p>Chariot 3 Advances 1 changes to Retreat 1, is stable. Horse 3 Advances 4, a preemptive move. Horse 7 Advances 6, intends to capture the center pawn. Cannon 5 Advances 4, if the red side responds with the minister, the center pawn can be unharmed. Cannon 3 Moves Sideways to 5, facing the cannon, not being threatened by the middle road. Cannon 7 Moves Sideways to 5, avoiding the red side advancing the horse to capture both pieces, taking the momentum of connecting cannons. According to this game, although the black side has the advantage of double cannons, the red side also has two horses competing for the initiative, which can be said to have an equal situation.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (87)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Da Li Wu Was a Notorious Foul-Mouthed Person</p>
<p>Last time, we talked about how bad the character of Red-Eyed Wang Si was. Little did we know that there was also a famous martial Laosheng Li Shunting who not only had a strange temper but also had a very foul mouth. Regarding his abilities, he was a top-notch performer in every aspect, including civil and martial arts, Kunqu and other operas. He could use a melancholic tune in the Gaoqiang shawm music. It could be said that his voice was unique throughout the ages. Back then, Mr. He Jiu, the number one copper hammer painted face actor, had a voice that was high enough, but he felt somewhat strained when singing the play "Fengyunhui" with him. In total, he knew no less than three or four hundred lines of plays. "Exploring the Camp" and "Iron Dragon Mountain" were considered unparalleled. Insiders called him Da Li Wu instead of his name because he ranked fifth among his siblings. Because Li Wu had no virtue in his mouth, he did not have good relationships with others, so he never became very popular. Throughout his life, he always served as a supporting actor. However, if the leading actors wanted him to co-star with them, they had to be careful of his bad ideas at all times. If they didn't handle it well, he might knock you down on stage. (Knock down means being defeated). At that time, there were several famous red actors who were knocked down by him. These people were Shuang Kuoting (i.e., Lao Shuang Chu), Mei Rongzhai, and Long Changsheng.</p>
<p>Shuang Kuoting was a famous Laosheng of the Kui school. Once, when singing "Zhushazhi", he let Da Li Wu play the role of the sick ghost Wu Da Xiang Gong. When he was having a dialogue with Han Yuanwai, he deliberately played a trick. When the Laosheng was about to sing the "I save you in urgency, I save you in difficulty, I save you from poverty" line, he missed a beat, receiving boos from the entire audience. The next day, Li Wu came to the backstage, with a pipe in his mouth and a tobacco pouch in his hand. The pouch was tied with a pendant carved with a Confucius shoe. A cross-shaped board was hanging on the upper of the shoe. When Boss Shuang entered the backstage, he deliberately pretended not to see him. He pointed at the tobacco pouch pendant and said to the people in the backstage: "Do you think my pendant is fresh? A board hanging on the shoe." This name is called "missing a beat." As soon as Shuang Chu heard it, he knew that he was mocking him for missing a beat yesterday; but knowing that this person had a bad mouth, he had to swallow his anger and not argue with him.</p>
