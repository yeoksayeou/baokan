<p>社評</p>
<h3>保衛西班牙！</h3>
<p>在國民軍和義德法西斯的聯合猛攻之下，在虛偽的國際「不干涉」政策的非法封鎖之下，西班牙人民反抗法西斯的戰爭，已臨到非常嚴重的關頭了。據路透電傳，西班牙國民軍連日在進，現在離巴薩隆納只有二十哩了。西班牙的人民正在浴血奮鬥，拚命阻截着敵軍的前進；全世界的每個角落裹，震盪着「援助西班牙！」「軍火運西」「阻止德義！」的呼聲。</p>
<p>西班牙是歐洲乃至世界和平的堡壘，它是必須保衛到底的。要是西班牙陷入了法西斯的魔手，結果不僅關係西班牙一國，不僅關係全歐洲，而且也關係全世界的和平。</p>
<p>首先，西班牙如果落入魔手，法國將受到致命的危害；比利牛斯山外將出現法西斯的大軍；法國與其非洲殖民地的聯繫將被割斷，墨索里尼可以唾手攫得法國的殖民地；英法的合作也將被截斷。</p>
<p>其次，西班牙如果落入魔手，英國也將遭遇空前嚴重的威脅：因爲這樣一來，它將成爲德義在歐洲西南角的根據地，可以從此夾攻英國；它可以控制直布羅陀，隔斷英國與其生命綫地中海的聯擊；它可以成爲德國進攻匹歐的據點）……。</p>
<p>一句話，德義在西班牙的冒險萬一成功，它們就可從中歐轉向西歐冒險；可從地中海轉向大西洋冒險，可從歐洲轉向非洲冒險；它們的對象，將不僅是小國，而且也包括大國；將不僅是歐洲，而且也包括非洲和拉丁美洲。</p>
<p>進攻西班牙，是德義法西斯第一决聯合的出擊；西班牙人民打擊德義法西斯，也就是保衛世界的和平。所以，在西班牙生死决鬥的今天，突破「不干涉」的束縛，極援助西班牙，正是全世界進步人類的共同任務！</p>
<p>老實說，西班牙戰爭是可以不擴大不延長的。它的所以擴大利延長，那全是英法所倡導的「不干涉」政策造成的惡果。英法以預防西班牙戰爭擴大爲理由，倡導一種「不干涉」政策，剝奪了西班牙政府從國外購買軍火的合法權利、使西班牙人民不能迅速的武裝起來，但是德義法西斯卻藉了「不干涉」政策作護符，繼續不斷的干涉西班牙的戰爭。</p>
<p>不干涉政策雖然是非法的，但如果能夠眞正的履行，多少還能帮助西班牙戰爭的迅速結束。可是事實上，英法方面是太忠實的履行了，例如英國恢復了「國外從軍法案」，禁止人民到西班牙去投効；法國也把法西的邊境封鎖了。但德義對西班牙的干涉。卻反變本加厲、，積極進行，兩年以來，德義在西班牙的魔手不曾有一天放鬆。單看西班牙外長伐育最近在國聯行政院會議中沉着的訴告，就可以明白：「去年十一月十二月兩月間，德義兩國運入西班牙的軍火，其數之巨，突破紀錄。自慕尼黑協定成立以後，使供中歐防禦用的軍隊得以撤退，於是軍隊與軍械運濟國民軍者大見增加。義國軍隊今正參與加泰隆之攻勢，如十二月三十一日所施於巴薩羅納天空的轟炸，實由德義空軍協助國民軍有以致之一。這樣看來，可見得「不干涉」政策不僅使民治各國逃避了援助西班牙人民反法西斯抗戰的義務、並且反使德義侵略者的罪行得了保障。英法所導演的不干涉的滑稽劇，的確不僅背叛了西班牙的人民，同時也危害了世界的和平。</p>
<p>右張伯倫這次訪問羅馬的時候，墨索里尼已公然向他表示：「非至西班牙共和政府傾覆，義大利軍隊决不撤退」、而現在進攻巴薩隆納的大部又顯然是義大利的軍隊。在這樣的緊急關頭，英法倘不從速變更不干涉政策，給西班牙政府以合法的援助，那筒直是帮同德義陷害西班牙的人民了。</p>
<p>西班牙必須保衛到底的，西班牙和中國一樣，是世界和平的堡壘！今天，西班牙已在德義兇猛進攻之下臨到緊急的關頭了。全世界愛好和平擁護民治的人士，必須起來反對縱容侵略的政策，掙脫「不干涉」的束縛，盡力去保衛它！</p>

<p>新加坡軍事根據地概況  約翰根塞原著　汪宏聲譯　　新加坡軍事根據地，被稱爲新的迫波羅陀，最近才完成。牠是日本的「二十一條」所促成的。遠在一九一五年，日本向中國提出二十一條件，明白表示了日本將是英國在遠柬的勁敵。　　一九一九年的翰澤力科上將就建議創立英國太平洋艦隊，以新加坡爲根據地。他主張在遠東的海上除了巡洋艦以外還要有戰鬥艦隊，他主張英國應該確立一個『西半球』海軍政策。　　一九二二年，帝國會議在倫敦開會，把澤力科的建議考慮了一番之後，决定建築新如坡軍事根據地。到一九二二年，華盛頓海軍限制條的簽訂了，確立了列强間的海軍比率，同時英日同盟廢止。　　在這個時候，英國國內的與論都說這一個新的軍事根據地是多餘的了，反而足以激怒日本引起他的疑懼之心；主持正羲的人更認爲這個新根據地是對於華盛頓海軍條的的一種道德上的破壞行動，因爲華盛頓海軍條的裹訂明禁止在經度一百十度以東建築堡壘或海軍根據地，而新加坡距這一個限制地帶只有六度之遙。　　有一部分人甚至認爲英國有意搗蛋，不過這一說後來被正式吾認了。根據地的健築工程是在一九二四年開始的，直至十五年以後—一九三八年二月十四日才全部吿成。　　新加坡是一個島，二十七哩長十四哩闊，有一條堤道跨佐和耳海峽與大陸相聯；位居馬來亞的頂點，到中國和日本的船只都要在這裏鄉向，恰好控制了東西交通的孔這。工作進行的時候，謠傳有人在進行間謀偵探活動，所以戒備甚嚴，警戒區裏的居民都勒令遷居，所有的建築工人，都打好手印。　　海軍根據地是在賽萊泰，島的北岸，離新加坡市區的十二英哩。軍港正東不遠，便是空軍根據地。新加坡一共有三種設計：一種是英國陸軍起草的，一種是海軍起草的，一種是空軍起草的。所謂新加坡根據地，是包括這三者而言的。在理論上，這一個根據地歸陸軍管轄，以杜弼大將爲統帥，他的職　是駕乎駐新海軍與空軍一切官佐之上。　　建築的時候須要遷山塡河，共費了六百萬立方英呎的土方；至於填高低地沼澤，則費了八百萬立方英呎的土方。島的右方一望無際地列着無數白獵色的油筒，內藏一百萬噸汽油。每一只筒都鑄成茶托形，據說高一有爆炸發生，這種形式的筒可以防止火燄的傳佈。地下都是軍火窖，儲藏之富，足使整個根據地化爲織粉而有餘。　　海軍根據地共佔面積二十一方哩。他的主要點綴品是兩個巨大非凡的船渠，一個浮船渠，一個修理船渠，萬一海軍有所行動，船隻受損，即使是最大的軍艦，也可以入渠修理。假使沒有新加坡根據地，損壞的艦船必須一直到摩耳太去裝配，那時候裝好回來，戰爭也許已經結束了。　　這個浮船渠，長的九百英呎，寬的二百英呎，是世上第三個大浮船渠。牠可以載負任何巨大的戰艦而依然上浮；底裏可以容六萬個人站立。這個船渠是在英國建造的，拆做幾部分從窩耳矰德拖到新加坡，計程一萬英哩，拖引的時候一共用八部荷蘭曳引機，爲現代海軍的偉觀之一。　　修理船渠較浮船渠略大，長的一千英尺國費六年工夫才完成，造價五百萬金元，用了四百五十萬立方英尺的混凝土。世界上任何船只都可以隨意安置，最近一次試騐證明他可以容納六千八百萬加侖的水。　　那個浮船渠遇到必要的時時，可以遷移他處，例如香港；修理船渠則不能移動。近兩個大船渠的地方，有機廠，電力廠，儲藏倉庫以及一只蘇彝士運河以東最大的起重機。每一樣物件都是成雙的，除了起重機，所以敵機來空襲時——假定他們衝得過防空綫——必須要做兩套頭工作哩。　　新加坡的唯一缺點是鄰近一帶有很多暗礁，使潛水艇的活動感到不便，不過敵人的潛水艇一近新加坡當然要發生同樣困難。　　新加坡的空軍根據地效率也是十分强大的，計有三個不同的軍用飛機塲和一個民用機塲。民用機塲是一九三七年六月裏開闢的，造價五百二十五萬美金，建築在海灘邊一塊新開墾的陸地上，所以陸上與水上飛機可以一舉兩用。這一個機塲還有一點好處，就是離新加坡繁盛市區甚近，汽車只要七分鐘就可以到達。　　其中一個主要軍用機塲也有水陸空軍兩用的設備，水上飛機用的優良海面計有二十英里之多。常駐在根據地的空軍不下四十大隊，必要時還可以從印度飛來增援。　　在技術上看來，新加坡實在是一個堅强的保壘，平時駐軍七千，而更重要者則是那些神秘的砲壘，以及許多砲台，散佈在新加坡島的極東端張巨地方，以及海峽中的許多小島上。這些小島上駐有許多砲兵隊與工程師。據說防禦工事中，不但包括二十五英重射程的十五吋口徑大砲，實際上還有世上最猛烈的十八吋口徑大砲。　　新加坡根　地的建築費用實在可觀，說也奇怪，這筆巨大的款子都從鴉片中得來。據官方估計，根據地的全部造價是八千〇五十五萬美金，其中海軍根據地一項，就費了三千八百五十萬至四千五百萬。　　那個浮船渠計値四百八十萬五干，從窩耳增德到新加坡的拖引費是一百萬，其中包括蘇彝士運河的通過稅五萬，賽萊泰的空軍根據地値三百五十五萬，還有兩個軍用飛機塲各値一百七十五萬。　　可是，非官方的估計還不止此，假使把軍官士卒的餉糈以及一切間接費用併算在內的話，所費不下二萬萬五千萬美金。　　這一筆款項的來源不一；海峽殖民地供給賽萊泰的土地，計値七十五萬，新西蘭出五百萬，香港出一百二十五萬。澳大利亞沒有拿出錢來，不過建設了一枝海軍。　　新加坡上面那個富足的馬來亞半島是分爲直屬與非直屬兩部分的。直屬部份——歸夾國本部直接管轄，——供給一百萬現金與價値一百五十萬的二技皇家派遺飛行隊。非直屬部份的政治獨立程度並不勝於直屬部份，其中佐和耳的蘇丹供給二百五十萬。總計上述各項協款，共二千一百萬，的佔根據地總値的四分之一稍弱。　　還有，到一九三三年爲止，海峽殖民地又供給現金六千萬本幣，（一元本幣等於美金五角八分）一九三三以後，又助常年定額恊款　年四百萬本幣，外加最近三年來的特別款項本幣一百五十萬。所以海峽殖民地所獻於根據地者，總計不下八千一百五十萬本幣，的合美金四千七百五十萬元。　　把海峽殖民地所出現金加上上述各項恊款，總數是六千八百五十萬美金。把這一個數目從總値的八千〇五十五萬美金上减去，得差數一千二百〇五萬，就是英國本部預算項下所支。實在便宜極了。除掉常年維持費二百五十萬不計，新加坡根據地所求於英國本部者，眞是微乎其微了。　　海峽殖民地的全部歲入，有百分之二十是由鴉片賣買中得來。這一樁賣買是政府的獨佔事業，英國從伊朗或印度買鴉片原料來，製成土膏，裝在一種小型的金屬管子裏。鴉片原料一元本幣可以買一新加坡兩（合一又三分之一盎司）；而一兩士膏却要本幣十二元。利息是可觀的，不過也是寓禁於徵的意思，故意把價格抬高了來减少銷路的。　　土膏的銷售，統制極嚴；只有登記過的癮君子才可以購買，而欲加入癮君子之羣則須醫師證明。　　幾年前，政府鑒於鴉片運輸也許要遭國際聯台行動的禁止，所以頒布了一種鴉片替補基金的辦法，在每年的鴉片稅項下抽出百分之十另行保管。這一筆基金現已積至三千萬本幣，儘可以不必再增加了。所以說，那三萬五千個登記過的烟民簡直担負了每峽殖民地所協助給根據地的款項中的五分之一。　　根據地落成的那一天，因了美國的艦隊的蒞臨，引起了世界上不少入的張皇，在這一决的中日戰事中，日本勢力日益南進，新加坡根據地的完成，當然會給予日本以相當顏色的。　　不久，英國又聲明『如遇必耍時，英國準備將海軍新根據地的一切設備，租借給美國應用。』換一句話說，就是如有戰事發生，英國將倒屣以迎美國人到新加坡來。　　一方面，美國人也是何樂而不爲，因爲夏威夷以西她沒有可以修理大船隻的地方，一旦遠東有事，新加坡的船渠正可以應她的需要哩。　　依照最可靠的軍事觀察結果，根據地只有在正北大陸一條路有受敵人攻擊的可能。海上進擊簡直是不可能的，而空襲則只可以使根據地受損而不能佔領。敵人企圖佔新加坡，只有用步兵在馬來亞或還難登陸，然後再南下，這就是要在這兩地方增加軍用機塲的原因。　　新加坡的最最可取之處是他的位置，距馬尼刺只有一五七八哩，距香港只有一六七四哩，而距橫濱却有三三四五哩。雖然日本正在台灣建築一個重要空軍根據地，不過想用海軍全力進攻，則非至少加足三千哩行程的火力不爲功，而這樣的行程已經超過現代出征軍艦應有的限度了。　　事實上，海軍戰爭的主要對象是商業而不是敵艦，太平洋戰爭的重要任務之一是遮斷日本商船的交通，再加上一個封鎖，便可以致日本的死命了。要達到這一個目的，新加坡是最理想的了。　　再有，新加坡的鄰土，又是絕對安全的地方，馮來　可以說是沒有政治活動，如民族運動之類存在的。試想把英國的軍事根據地放在埃及，伊拉克或是印度，那裏的政治情勢實在是一個很嚴重的問題。並且新加坡有最完美的空軍設備，比沒有好機塲　直波羅陀方便多多了。　　、所以把軍事力量集中在新加坡有好幾種作用：給英國海軍一個儲油庫與修理船渠；使香港有了武力的後盾，同時保衛了澳洲，科侖坡與加爾加答；在英國的殖民地中心建立了一個裝甲防禦樁，成爲歐亞交通的總樞紐。　　最要者，他給予日本一個警吿。根據地彷彿堅决地吿訴日本英國在世界的這一方面永不願把商業利益放棄的。說到這一點，不禁使人想起羅伯决元帥生前說過的一句話：總有一天世界的歷史耍在新加坡决定。也許英國正在等着這一天的到來。靑島淪陷後　外國商業大受打擊　進出品貿易家已趨停頓　軍事經濟上日不甘放棄　　字林報云、魯省要港靑島、爲景物美麗之避暑地、除可作爲終年不凍之海軍根據地、而優於烟臺大連以外、復爲魯省產物如烟。絲。棉。煤。等之出口地、水道方面、與上海極近、陸有膠濟路、啣接隴海與北寗兩路、而達南北物產富庶之區、此决戰事爆發之前、靑島日人、猶不足一千五百人，今則日本與滿洲之日商紛紛擁入，將達二萬五千人、靑島之外商貿易、刻因日方橫加取締而遭擯斥、外國入口商、因遭滙兌及航運之限制、而被迫不得經商、是項限制、乃日方海陸軍總司令部所實施、無理可喻、外國入口商、在戰前與華人大小商行有交易者、今則大受打擊。因此等商行閉歇者、與被日方强佔者極多、一旦落入日人之手、即不復需要外國原料、故外國入口商、只得封歇其靑島辦事處、行駛海中與海岸之外國輪船亦遭嚴格之限制、仍不能自由使用各碼頭、而只得停泊海面、但日人所有之輪船、則得自由應用一切碼頭便利、壟斷駁運、雖出駁運費由日輪駁運、但其服務殊不可靠、故輪船駛靑島後、被種種留難，而受完全不必耍之損失，外國商行之進出口貿易、實巳趨停頓、惟外商烟草、仍繼續經營、其所受打擊、不若普通外商之甚、日人麻醉中國人民之日常生活、到處顯然可見、如五色旗與太陽旗交义而懸、以及日軍與華人友善之照片等、每隔數日、日方當局、輙令偽維持會羅致愚民、敎之高呼口號近有所謂反共游行者、持荒謬圖畫、導以樂隊、沿途燃放爆竹，醜態百出、並有反共協會會員白俄若干、參加游行、此輩白俄、由日方爲之成立反共協會、其所言所行、悉遵其主子、即日軍當局之命是從、日軍當局、甚且命令白俄兒童不得入靑島英國等外國學校、因日方稱、此等學校之訓育與敎育、與日方理想不相符合云云、故白俄兒童、均返白俄學校、所有公共便利與業務如電話。電報。電力。自來水。與公共汽車、完全在日方之手、一切碼頭業務如駁運等、在日方海陸軍庇護之下、悉歸日方壟斷、實業。麵粉廠。鐵礦。及鐵工廠等、均由日方大商行炎木家所接收、有少數工廠、仍山華人經營者、不久亦將由日方接收無疑、總之、山東每一種可獲利之貿易、非已被日方接收、即在進行接管中、而外商業務、則無論如何、必被强迫逐出、外商公司之沿海航運日趨减少、因出口貨物稀少、故海輪駛靑者、寥寥無幾、但日本輸船、則航行頻繁、商店之舶來品日少、而各種日貨、則源源輸入、且多半藉口軍需品而不繳關稅、致外商不能與之競爭、前中政府與行政人員所有財產、均被沒收、作爲日方海陸軍之財產、殷富之華籍居民巳全數逃避他鄕、因日人之增多、日商茶室。旅館。酒肆。與百貨店、亦紛粉開設、昔爲華人所有之大建築物與學校、今均駐日軍、外僑與日軍、頗少衝突事件、因靑島無租界、故日軍對於外人之情感、並不十分緊張、啣接靑島與濟南之膠濟路、仍爲華方游擊隊不斷襲擊之目的物、此輩游擊隊據云、乃前靑島市長沈鴻烈所指揮、每夜在鐵路綫襲擊、日軍每一疏忽、火車即行出軌會此而外、沿海靑島·威海衛·與烟臺一帶、每日必有日軍若于、被游擊狙擊而傷亡、總之、無論在軍事上或經濟上、靑島均有絕大價値、日軍一旦得之、諒不甘放棄也、美長老會教士談　湖南抗戰民氣高昴　衡陽都會產業亦被日軍轟

<p>新醫與新藥週刋言論民衆對於誇大醫藥廣吿應有之認識  宋恪三　　自戰事西移，本市醫藥失其管理，一般江湖醫藥競在各報登載誇大之廣吿，其結果，雖藥商醫生，固增若干亂客，而枉死城中亦添若干寃鬼，鄙人骨　在喉，難安緘默爰借本刊，作此警報。　　（一）求各求利之心，人人之所同具，顧求之亦有道焉，孔子日「當與貴是人之所欲也，不以其道得之不處也，醫業本非難於出名之職業，祇須人格高尚，學騐豐富，或有獨到之發明，或具過人之技術，自能博人信仰，名利兼收，假使道德學騐，並不過人，而一心唯名利之是求，惟有出於不正當之方法，誇大廣吿，即爲不正當方法之一，用不符事實之語氣，惹人注意，誘人就診，雖可收效於一時，實則暴露自己之才能不足，不能循正當之途徑求名利而已，故好爲誇大廣吿之醫生，必爲席醫無疑，求冶於庸醫之門，不啻自尋死路，蓋因此而失去訪求良醫之機會也，此民衆所應認識者一。　　（二）「康子饋藥，拜而受之，日，丘未達，不敢嘗，」可見人類愛惜生命之心，對於性質不明之藥品，不敢嘗試，自古已然也，目下報紙所登之藥品之廣吿，誰能明其成分，誰能知其藥理，盲自購服，近於行險徼倖，殊非愛惜生命之道，即使並無大害，而蠱惑民衆之意識，躭誤正當之治療，其影響亦非淺鮮，最近，如某藥商遍登廣吿，謂敷用某藥，可以預防天花，多數讀者，信以爲眞，購而敷之以爲牛痘即可不種，及至天花暴發，始知受愚，已追悔莫及，本市某隔離醫院中許多重性犬花之兒童，均曾敷用該藥，此非一强有力之證明乎，故報紙上所登載之藥品，非經醫生指定，不可輕率購服，此民衆所應　識者二。　　（三）或謂此類藥品，曾經多數醫師證明，報紙上，不常見若干醫生親筆簽名之廣吿乎，是亦不能專爲民衆責也，須知此類簽名，不足憑信，蓋國人素重情面，而此類簽名之請求，往往由熟人介紹，在醫生以爲一舉手間而情面可關，且芳名尊楷，藉此在報端刊露，更何樂而不爲，其於該藥曾吾試用，是吾用之有效，不暇問也，須知藥品關係生命，非普通商品可比，盲目介紹，不啻借刀殺人，其爲流弊，何可勝言，故醫生簽名，不能視爲藥品有效之證，此民衆所應認識者三。　　綜上所言，可見誇大之醫藥廣吿，影響於公衆健康，至深且鉅，當此醫藥管理失其效用，醫藥團體不能干涉非會員行爲之時，惟有大聲疾呼，向民衆竭其愚誠而已，此本篇之所由作也。通俗醫話種痘閒話（續）  謝筠壽　　（六）種痘技術上的注意　種痘原不是一種艱難的技術。不一定要聲師才可施行。加以吾國幅員遼關。醫師人才缺乏。鄉僻的地方。施行種痘的人。十九多非醫師。因此就有種種疏忽的地方。吾現在把他一一寫下來。　　（甲）皮膚上的消毒　種痘之先。應當把皮膚用酒精來消毒。鄉間購買酒精困難（因爲烟酒稅的關係。酒精是屬於酒類。沒有賣酒執照的不能賣酒精）或價值太高。多有不消毒的事情。　　（乙）沒有痘苗盤　痘苗原和有水及甘油的。臨用的時候。應常吹在痘苗盤上。攪和一下才行。　　（丙）種痘刀應當消毒　經過種痘以後的刀。應當先加淸拭。再把刀在火酒燈燄上通過數次。施行消毒。以防傳染弟一人的病毒到弟二個人身上去　　（丁）痘苗的保存　痘苗應當放在寒冷的地方。如果遇到了高熱。種後多不簪感。間時還要注意痘苗上所寫的期限。過期的就不可用。　　（戊）割時不可太深一般的人。喜歡種痘的時候見血。道實在是錯誤的。所以割切的時候。以僅見紅痕爲度。不應當出血。出血多了。就成不善感。　　（己）種痘的審愼　嬰孩太幼稚。身體太虛弱。全身有蔓延性皮膚病或是有熱性病。重症的時候。種痘應當審愼。　　（庚）其他的注意　皮膚上酒精拭過以後。還未乾燥的時候。以及接種刀火燄上通過後。還未冷却的時候。都不可以應用。　　最後還有一句話。就是這樣危險的病症。能够以這樣簡單的方法來防止他。救數百億的生靈的人是誰呢。就是英國醫生愛德華特全納氏（Edward　Jemer）。氏在一七九六年五月十四號第一决試行種痘正距今一百四十三年。吾人對於這樣有功人類的人。應當怎樣感謝他才行呢。疾病常識胃病（二）  莊畏仲　　楔子　　胃是幹着實際工作的臟器，卽使供一天三餐的消化，已經是够疲勞了何况還有許許多多的使胃做例外工作的機會，許許多多使胃受不適刺激的原因，所以胃病很普遍，不過輕重不同，其輕者易被忽視罷了。　　喫是動物的大欲，是動物求順應生活的手段，但求口腹之欲，不顧胃腸之勞，恐怕不單是中國人這樣吧！不過中國烹飪，比較多油膩，餐量又比較的大，所以好像中國人患胃病的，特別的多一些　　胃病是一個攏統的名詞，我們可以大別爲二類，一種是器質性胃病，一種是神經性胃病。器質性胃病，如炎症，腫瘤等，有病理解剖的變化。神經性胃病，並沒有病理解剖變化可證，或爲知覺性胃神經的異常。或爲運動性胃神經的異常，或爲分泌性胃神經的異常，或爲各種神經性的混合症。　　到胃病的原因，其器質順者，多數可以刺激的字包括之，此可以分質的和量的方面，又可以分化學的，理學的，細菌的數種。其神經性者，每爲神經衰弱，癒病或其他神經性疾病的一個症侯，有時也有與腦脊髓和其他臟器以及胃自己之器質變化病併發。此外女子有子宮及共附屬器的疾病時，每有反射性發生神經性胃病的。但神經性胃病，有時也有獨立發生者。　　醫治胃病，似易而實難，慎食之戒，可暫遵而不能久守，且多數內服藥，在未奏效之前，先已刺激胃壁，每有弄巧成拙者。患胃病的人，首重攝生，藥治和理學治療，僅爲决要之事。茲用通俗的語氣，把各種胃病的大槪情形，扼要寫出一些。　　（A）胃的炎症　　胃的炎症有急性和慢性的分別。急性胃炎，除普通型外，尙有傳染性胃炎，中毒性胃炎，鋒窩織性胃炎等特殊型。慢胃炎，除普通型之外，梅毒和結核，襲胃的很少，但非絕無。　　普地型慢炎，在臨證上所見最多，多數爲由漸而來，像慣食難於消化的食物和有過量多量的習憤者，寗用過冷過熱和刺激者香辛品者，齒牙不健全或因別種原因而咀嚼不充分者，諸如此類，多爲慢胃炎的原因。此外在他病經遠中，也往往續發本症，如胃癌，胃圓形潰瘍，胃擴張等，常伴慢胃炎，又如心肺肝腎等病，每起胃的虛充血，因而惹起鬱血胃炎者很多，肺癆病，梅毒，腎炎，糖尿病，慢性關節僂麻質斯、貧·巴塞多氏病。阿狄森氏病目每能誘起慢胃炎，而慢闌尾炎和膽囊炎等，往往併發本症（未完）正在流行之天花  聶傳賢　　今當新醫與新藥周刊發刋之始，正值天花流行，形勢猖獗之時，不揣愚昧，略書數言，對防止天花流行方面，或有·小補也。　　（一）天花之傳染情形：天花傳染之途徑，亦與其他傳染病相彷，不外直接與間接二種，直接傳染，是與患者直接接觸而生，如患者談話時之飛沫膿皰之膿液，痂屑等，皆爲傳染之媒介，間接傳染，乃由帶菌之人與物，間接傳播而生，如醫生，看護，家族，病人，用物等，皆可居間傳播，病原侵入人體之口，大多以呼吸器官為首，消化器官，間亦有之，至於患者能傳染他人之時期，可謂全病程中皆能有之，允以發疹脫痂期爲甚，現值犬花流行之際，凡遇公共塲所，及公共車輛中，吾人隨時皆有被傳染可能。　（未完）治療常識血管硬化症及高血壓之食餌療法  沈恭　　一，要旨　血管硬化時宜力避過飲暴食，不然易起苦悶感及睡眠障碍。血壓亢進時宜安靜，少攝肉食及食鹽，則有時血壓著减。　　二，蛋白質　須力避過量之蛋白質，蓋過剩之尿酸及圓體（由蛋白分解而生）每亢進血壓。煮肉時國體亦移行肉汁內，故肉汁之攝取，亦宜戒除。高血壓症時若併發膽固醇過多症，則宜限制含類脂肪之肉，蛋，臟器等。　　最適宜之食餌爲牛乳，蔬菜，及蛋等。　　三，食鹽　務宜少食，在血壓亢進時允甚。　　四，刺戟性食餌　刺戟性食餌，均宜力避。調味料之强烈者，亦宜限制。他若咖啡，茶，酒精飲料及肉汁等均亢進血壓，故屬禁忌。　　五，液體攝取量普通每日可飲水一立半左右。含炭酸之飲料，易搖動血壓，不宜飲用醫事紀聞醫師公會　簽發證明書　　上海市醫師公會，自與中華醫學會聯合辦理審核簽發醫師證明書以來，各醫師莫不稱便，凡醫師遺失其所領之畢業文憑或衛生署證書者，或已經學校畢業因故尙未領到文憑及署證者，均可前往池浜路二十五號該會聲請辦理，茲聞自去年十月四日起至本年一月二十日止，已經醫師公會審核通過者，有張包熙，朱文鑫，陶漱石，華壽明，陳景文，許樹屏，吳息連，李同濟，陳少鈞，陸頌亞，李壽，陸崇善，王浴辰，趙天彙，朱文祥，方椿才，陳最，葉淼，蔣佩珩，高仕楷，鄭沛淦，潘思齊，繆述恩，夏淸祥，等二十四人云。</p>

<p>現代生活	冬季兒童生命之大刦的百日咳  （沈忠軍）　　百日咳又名驚驚咳。七歲左右之小兒患者居多。本病之症狀。不咳則已。一咳則連聲劇咳。致患兒面紅耳赤。額汁淋漓。甚而作嘔。吐出食物。頭部靑筋暴起。眼球突出。痛苦非常。患木症之小兒。最可怖者爲併發肺炎。大抵患兒之死亡者以肺炎最占多數。且百日咳之經過時期甚長。病兒不僅肺臟損傷。並使身體健康受重大之打擊。致日漸衰弱。卽幸未患肺炎。而在日後亦難免不繼發肺結核（癆症）之憂。此在爲家長者。不可不加意負責看護也。　　我國醫學知識尙未普及。每視百日咳爲感冒之徵恙。或誤投市上雜藥。或放任不爲治療。以致每年犧牲之小生命。大可驚人。此在爲國培養實力者。能不注意及此乎。　　編者按。爲小兒治療百日咳者。千萬勿亂投雜藥。否則爲害誠不堪設想。依各醫家經騐而言。而『肺活』PhlthWeal給病兒內服。治療百日咳。最爲安全適當。因『肺活』效能淸肺化痰止咳。且對於强肺之功允著。故能預防肺炎及肺癆等危險癥候。加之肺活內並無分毫麻醉劑。卽乳兒服用。亦甚安心無憂。現代中學生　一個悲慘的嚴重的問題  （陸志成）　　目下在水深火熱中的中國人有兩種。其一是正在遭受着日人的鐵蹄與匪禍的難民。其二是擔負着讀書責任的中學生。難民所受的威脅。是眼前的飢寒與死亡。中學生所受的威脅。是康健的摧殘。及因此引起民族的衰落。讀者們若以這個比擬爲過分。那就請看一看下面幾件有代表性的事實吧。　　（一）有一位家長曾對我說。他從前在中學讀書時的情形。他說：『我們從前在中學時所受的痛苦。比了小學時代的還要厲害。……常時每日上午八時至下午四五時。均屬正課。而每日敎師所吩咐應做之功課。又的需四五小時……余在中學時。自信尙能努力。然以趕功課之故。每日遲眠早起。星期日亦極忙碌。卽洗浴理髮。尙於極倉促中爲之。……如此讀書。至高二時。卽患高度之神經衰弱症……至高中畢業時。則强健之體格。活潑之精神。均已變爲衰弱呆滯矣』。　　（二）有一位高中女學生對我說：『我每天做功課非到晚上一時不能完。但睡得太遲却又睡不着了。常常要到三時方能合上眼睛。你想。一晚只睡得三個鐘頭。那還能不頭脹腦裂。發燒生病呢？你莫以爲我是一個例外。其實是過着和我一樣生活的同學。不知多多少少呢』！　　（三）有一位中學生寫信給我說：『現在中學的課程。最使人感困難的。就是數學。平均每星期的有六個到八個鐘點之多。一個鐘頭所留下的題目。假使腦筋遲鈍些的同學。五個鐘頭也做不完。差不多每星期要花費十七八個鐘頭來幹數學。……一個性情不相近數學的。但爲了畢業。爲了會考。也不得不死幹。大部分的時間都花在這一門功課。結果也弄不好。倒反把自己所喜歡的功課都丟了。沒有功夫來看她。……學校的功課這樣的多。在木校想畢業就够懸心的了。再加上一個會考。弄得一些同學不要命的趕。我所知道的一位同學。他在前年因怕會考不能畢業。有十天晚上不睡。以後感覺精神支持不住。便打嗎啡針。結果還有兩門不及格。道多麼殘忍啊！不道樣拚吧。功課這麼多。就別想畢業。拚命吧。精神有限。只好打嗎啡針了』。　　這次我並未作什麼公開的調查。不過把中學生的危機當作資料。和朋友們討論罷了。而所發見的。就是神經衰弱一症。已成了中學生的一個嚴重問題。所以我說：現在中學的痛苦。比眼前的難民還要深刻。　　靑年學生是民族生命的活力素。是國家社會的中堅。他們所負着的使命和任務。足見是很重大的。若一旦被神經衰弱所束縛。則精神頽唐。意識不定。生理失常。理想與生活不一致。因而勇氣沮喪。活力减退。終日惛懵。時而頭痛失眠。時而心跳眩暈。幾全身是病。致　　使前途有爲之靑年——一變而爲無用之殘身。在此國家生命將被毀滅的非常時期。在這民族歷史將被斬絕的緊急關頭。怎樣救濟這一大羣被神經衰弱所摧殘的中學生。確是一個迫切的問題！　　中學生所遭到的威脅雖然比了難民還要厲害。但救濟他們的方法却比救濟難民爲簡單而容易。據多數衛生家的指示。靑年學生最好時常進服一種『米美爾』補腦汁MemoryNe　urotic以增進腦力。補給新精力。如此。可常保頭腦清爽。精神强健。自能勝任艱深與繁重的課程。而無疲勞現象。因『米美爾』補腦汁爲時代的神經大補劑。富含各種維他命。蛋白質。及卵黃素外。幷有從健康動物腦髓中提出之荷爾蒙與精液腺中抽得之精液腺荷爾蒙。此等名貴成分。俱爲他種同類補劑所絕無者。故『米美爾』效果優秀。確爲克服神經衰弱之利器。靑年學生爲將來幸運計。不可不備！但市上劣藥繁多。須指明『米美爾』爲要。人類願望着的　返老還少問題　四五十歲者如何防止早老　高齡老翁怎樣人老精不老  沈兆荃譯　　載美國健身報第十二卷第十期　　一個人自出生之後。至少要有二十年的敎養。方可爲社會服務。所以到四五十歲的人。正因費了許多苦心。受着多少敎訓。能獲得了些知識經騐。和生活技能。在做人剛極高興。而事業對於社會最有價値之時。那裹知道老衰又不自然而然地漸漸光臨了。這個老境的可怕。只要它一到來。無論何人便會失去進取心。什麼地方都帶着消極的意味。可見老境的可怕。在世界上再沒有比這個更悲慘的了。　　老衰的變化。至了高齡時代。無論誰何。都爲不可逃免之悲運。不過衰老的年齡。各有早遲。有的人到九十歲或百歲纔發現者。也有人尙在四五十歲閒。即呈早老者。據生物學家吿訴我們——大概於日常過勞心機之人〇〇〇〇〇〇如文學家，政治家，科學家，大企業家等。都容易衰老。他如一般生活浪漫的人們〇〇〇〇〇如色慾在淫，烟酒濫用者。更能使衰老速進，而生命早終　　法國巴黎大學醫科敎授佛羅夫氏Voronoff曰。人雖不能不死。但可以長壽。按動物公例而言。人類之生命。應活至其生理發育期年齡的七倍——今假定二十歲爲發育完成之年。則壽命實以一百四十歲。爲人類的理想年齡。凡未届此天年而死者。都謂之夭折。且考之事實。一二百歲之老人。報章上時有記載。（譯者按日前本報所刊恭祝馬相伯老人百齡大慶一電。亦可足證長壽爲確實可能之事）。不過比較爲少見耳。而少見之原因。多緣老人失其少年時抵抗病魔之力。譬如同一肺炎症。少年人患之。每多就愈。老年人患之。每易致心臟衰弱而死。今使老人常具少年之精力。則病魔自不足懼。而高壽可期矣。然則返老還少之術又如何。此在近代可以科學來補救之。　　秦始早派力士東渡扶桑求長生不老之藥。爲歷史上有名的故事。還有人信佛信道。呑砂煉丹。想與龜鶴同壽。足見「長壽」一事。無分古今。誰也是願望着的。不過這些理想。多是迷信的愚昧的。　　現在有許多人。每至中年——即四五十歲的時候。就呈現元氣早失。精力減退。以及腰部痠痛。而不堪勞作者。此種人卽謂之未老先衰——早老症——他們雖遍服市間一切補品。但結果無一不令人失望。多是勞而無功。他們再不知道人體的生活機能。非常巧妙。衰老的原因很是複雜。决非吃什麼補丸。打什麼補針。所可挽救的。此必需有高深之學理根據。而縝密與複合的製劑。始能用來改造生命——達到理想的不老願望。　　自法國生物大家百龍石卡兒BrownSequard德國開丁元大學敎授柏爾託爾特A．A．B　erthald二氏倡返老還童之學說以來。世界學者乃相繼奮起研究。至最近有德國研究不老術之專家亨達博士所創造的一種防老劑「安保利心」Apopleyxin允爲轟動全球。惹起學術界大大的注意經多。方面的普遍試騐。公認木劑確有返老還少之效果。從此天下早衰老人。可長壽有術　　此種防老劑「安保利心」Apopleyxin爲亨氏三十餘年嘔心紋腦之結晶。其成分中。有動物體內之心。腦，腎及靑春腺各種荷爾蒙。有各種生活素有人參與鹿茸。集中，西。動，植礦，各藥精華於一爐。經最複雜之科學法調配。凡與人生命脈有關者……可謂搜羅無遺。吾人服之。能使全體生活機能活潑亢進。而生命力不衰。　　據各國生物學者所發表。現代人類在三四十歲精力最旺。到五六十歲便入於老境。精力頽敗。今試用此種防老劑「安保利心」Apopleyxin於一般早衰老人。於服至十星期之後。唯一現象。能使七十老翁恢復少年時之精力與興緻。一般未老先衰的壯年。可令他們重新有一個强健的體魄。最奇怪者。還有巳經老邁的女子。服後能使面色紅潤。皺紋消去。回復了她的靑春與活潑。性慾早衰的老頭兒。可以古井重波。我們現在再把多方面所實騐的效果。歸納起來。作一個簡明的記述在下面：　　（一）老年男女用之。可使元氣旺盛。精力不衰。身體溫暖。不畏寒冷。耳目淸亮。步履輕捷。並無頭昏目花之苦。　　（二）四五十歲的壯年用之。可防止神經衰弱。能使頭腦淸爽。記憶力增進。而精神充足。勞作不倦。能使活動社會之齡。可延長至七八十歲以上。　　（三）本劑有活血去瘋之效。可治一切筋骨痠，麻木，半身不遂，腰痛等症。效力優於他種普通藥品。老人常服。永無此等痛苦發生。　　（四）本劑有極完美之强心作用。凡老年之心臟衰弱。心悸怔忡不安。心虛易驚，心跳，心盪，心口痛，氣喘，各種心臟疾患及呼吸困難，立服立效，且早衰老八用之，能補益心經。而常保心神舒暢。睡眠安全。　　（五）本劑中有乳酸菌製劑。效能消滅腸內各種有害病原細菌。防止血液中毒。及防止血管硬化。並可通便淸腸。助消化兼能治療各種胃腸病。且此種乳酸菌劑。對於防老益壽。尤爲最近學說所盛行。　　（六）本劑能調節血液之循環力。可使過高之血壓減低。故能預防心臟破裂及中風（腦溢血）具有特效。　　（七）本劑中之Good．CaloiDiuretine爲治療血管硬化，及肥胖病之最新發見的特效品。若用以預防中風（卽腦溢血）效著可靠。並非市上普通海草製劑可比。　　我在這裹寫過了防老劑「安保利心」Apopleyxin一切效用之後不得不向讀者說一說：人類有生必有死。這是誰都不可吾認的。而今所言之「安保利心」絕非爲達到長生不老之術。不過它的作用。確能促進人體各部生活力旺盛。抵抗病魔之力加强。破壞生命的一切誘因。得以防止與消除。因而能阻止衰老的速進。使不應該老的人可以不致早老。並延長其活動的年齡。能爲社會服務幾年。就是已到了高齡的人。亦老當益壯。而能繼續欣欣向榮生活到理想的年齡。所以有許多科學家，著作家，大企業家因服用此種「安保利心」能延長其活動力——精神和腦力——雖然到七八十歲。看起來還不過是三四十歲時一樣的健旺。並因此竟能完成其工作與希望。是乃防老劑於人類之所貢獻也只注意上面的一種。若不把日常生活中的衛生放在心上。那也是不行的。賢明的讀者。應該使生活合乎自然法則。最低限度——總在可能範圍以內。力行除去飲食過飽。性慾狂淫。及煙酒過度等等的不良惡習。同時再用防老劑來彌補生命力。這才是防止早老的最好法門——也就是延齡益壽最合於科學的途徑。　　（附註）「安保利心」Apopleyxin乃是一種銀色的內服片劑。男女到四十歲之後。均可服用。不淪有病無病。聽質强弱。對於身體任何方面爲有百利而無一弊。本品新由德國到滬。永安，先施，新新各大公司西藥部。各處高等大藥房均有出售。瓶內附有極詳細之中英文說明書。可以披閱。　譯者附識肺病　那裏有特效藥  （顧宏達醫師）　　肺病之療法。今日尙無能直接入肺殺菌之特效藥。此爲世界學者所共認。市間宣傳如何特效之藥劑。一經化學分析。每有並無特殊藥物。甚且多含有嗎啡等麻醉品在內。若患者誤投此等雜藥。當時雖覺痛苦減少。但不知病根未除。內緊外弛。症候依然暗中進行滋蔓。倘一旦暴發。則病勢更增嚴重。必至不可收拾。後悔莫及。故亂投雜藥。實爲最冒險之行動也　　從現代醫學的立塲來講。而適合治療原理。宜於病人在家療養之內服藥。首推「肺活」Phith　Weal一藥、本品爲近世醫擊公認之臟器製劑、其效能使肺之生機復活、產生天然的防禦機能及抗癆素。發揮自然治愈的作用。故患者服後。即覺肺淸氣爽。祛痰稀鬆。咳喘減少。食事增進。體元日旺。病情呈極速與顯著之治愈現象。凡患一二期肺病者。採服『肺活」。並加意調養。結果必恢復健康。斷無失敗之虞。氣喘者之生命預測  沈兆荃醫師　　哮喘一症。中醫名曰喘或痰飲。其症状爲呼吸困難。氣管擁塞。肺葉迫促。咳嗽不爽。痛苦非筆墨所能形容。本病之原因以慢性支氣管炎居多。患者老少與中年者皆有。如不治愈。則時發時止。桎梏終身。有時患者並因肺臟衰弱。而繼發肺癆症。生命即有危險之憂。若老年人罹有哮喘。肺易氣腫。而壓迫心臟。致心臟衰弱。偶一不愼。心臟能立時停止活動。生命即有不測之慮。大抵患者如有心跳現象。即爲哮喘病之危險信號。患者不可不注意也。　　哮喘一症。在昔日因無良藥可治。故患者苦之。而市間雖有治哮喘藥品發售。唯多含有麻醉成成份在內。衹有一時之效。幷無根治之功。每發即服者。時有成癮之弊。尤後患者爲可怖。　　根據多數醫師報吿。近有「哮立平』Holipin爲治喘特效藥。服後立能順氣平喘。強心化最爲適宜。　　著者按哮喘病人之肺臟。大致衰弱不健。倘同時採用『肺活』一藥。以强其肺。則效果益佳。對除根更可事半功倍春秋免開尊口  天　　臥室的對窓，是一家舞塲，每晚熄燈安睡以後，看着照耀到床前的霓虹燈光，每每想起東京銀座街禁用霓虹燈的消息來。我沒有到過日本，自然沒有領略過銀座街的風光，不過據朋友說：銀座街是東京最熱鬧的街道，允其是晚膳以後，徜徉其間，是別有風味的。然而在這樣熱鬧的街道上，一旦禁用了增加都市容光的霓虹燈，其黯然失色，是可以想見的。但是爲了「百年戰爭」，似乎不得不節的救難。霓虹燈旣禁用於先，火柴桿亦截短於後，以及上辦公廳廢除皮鞋，而僅着木展等等，「膺懲」的反響，確實是有些手忙脚亂了。　　昨見快訊社二十二日香港電：據臺灣消息，日人在台向民間取去之金銀器皿，在去年一年間，的五百餘萬日元，其所取之物品，無論酒瓶，茶壺，舊幣都有。甚至向人民口中取下其金鑲之假牙去。　　這眞是一則有趣的新聞。我們有句形容貧窮的俗語，呌做「除出鈕子嘸沒銅」，（從前衣服上都用銅鈕扣，如上海風行過一時的「套鈕」然）現在却更禍延金鑲的假牙，其貧窮的程度，也不言可喻了。　　所以，令人憂慮的是：那些金鑲的假牙也都敲了下來以後，還將轉些什麼念頭出來？某報以「免開尊口」作爲這條電訊的標題，我以爲轉贈這些「大言不慚」的發言人，倒是頗爲適當的。　　什麼什麼，一切一切，還是「免開尊口」吧。中國藥材鋪風光  新亮　　一爿中國藥鋪，除非有上的一千種不同的，自低廉的橘皮起至昂貴的羚羊角止的藥草，申殼與石礦，是小够稱爲完備的。　　照最低的估計，其中的有四百種藥味，日常在應用着。而依據了醫生的指示，某種藥材須先浸入蜜糖或人乳，有些更須與鹽或米酒煮過後，才可應用。　　中國的藥物表，誠如一家水菓店裏的目錄然。例如，夏天被當作冷飲品的西瓜，就在治熱病的藥味裏佔着重耍的位置。其餘如荷葉，蓮心，橄欖（允其是西藏的乾的一種），杏仁，桂圓，柿子，枇杷與生梨等，也均是治咳的特效藥。　　中國的藥物表，又像是動物園裏的名單。虎骨是可以當藥用的，與酒浸過後，可以治風濕病。其他父有龜甲，羚羊角，蟬衣。鹿茸（每盎司値價三百元），死了的蠶，犀牛角，蠍子與蜈蚣等等。其中最後兩種，則比較很少用到。　　此類中有三樣奇罕而高貴的東西，値得來提一提，其一就是馬寶。據說在蒙古與滿洲的畜牧塲裏，吾們可以發見一種性情奇特的馬。它常常在月下施深呼吸，而一連幾天不進飼料，將它殺死後，吾們就可以在它的胃裏，得到一種硬似石塊的「寶物」，乃是醫治神經病最好的藥品。又在牛與狗的骨裏，也有此種硬塊存在——這三種藥材，只有在幾家大藥鋪裹才可以買到。　　另一些中國藥材，又像一家雜貨店裏的東西。其中有治寒症的薄荷，治胃痛的大蒜，酒醋與鹽等，最後一種，據云是用來醫治內熱的。　　中國藥材大多是草根之類，其餘則以石礦與甲殼佔多數。各種藥材都須向專地去採辦，雖然，有許多小藥鋪也向他地去買了價廉的束西來當眞品出賣的。　　藥鋪裏都以兩爲單位。大多數藥材雖都是只有幾分錢一兩，配一帖兩服的普通的中國藥，倒總要在一元錢左右。　　在中國藥鋪裏當先生的，要經過長期的訓練後，才能勝任。靠牆壁排列的，儘是藥抽屜，每一只抽屜裏，則放着各種藥材。配藥的人必須先知道這些抽屜置放的程序，所以，非經過三年的學徒生涯，他是不能够知道一千種不同藥味，是怎樣地放置着的。　　與外國藥房的將藥方拿到製藥室裏去不同，中國藥鋪的配藥先生是當了顧客的面，來撮配各種藥味的。他先將藥方放在櫃台上，然後，在櫃台與抽屜之間走着，從各只抽屜裏，他取出各種不同的藥來放在幾張小的方紙上。　　一張普通的中國藥方，總有九至十三種藥味，所以，他就要如此地往來十次。當他將最後的一種藥味秤好的時候，一個對藥的先生就跑來一一地查看一番，看配藥的有否錯誤，之後，他在藥方上蓋了一負責的印子，配方的再跑來一一地用一種軟的，上印此種藥味的名稱與功效的紙張，將各種藥味，都包了起來。　　一個平常人眞不知道怎樣用一張四吋見方薄紙，包起一定量的藥來，他一定會覺得不是紙太小，就是紙頭被摺得很皺，或甚至於是破了。然而，中國藥鋪裹的先生，却能够包得很快。並且很整齊。　　於是，配藥的更將各種包子一起用一張大紙包起了，頂上放了那張藥方，而用細繩包紮完事。價錢照例是寫在藥方上的，在平日，吾們總可以得到一個九扣，每逢國曆或廢曆的初一月半，則再可以有一個額外的九扣得到。　　有幾家中國藥鋪，叉在免費贈送棗子或共他的甜品，以使病人在嘗飲藥湯後，得聊解苦味的。　　現在，更有代客煎藥的，他們將煎好的藥湯，分裝在兩只熱水瓶裏，每服只取五分。中國醫生很少有對病人說明，藥湯到底當在飯前或飯後飲服的，但是一般人都相信，在飯前服下較好，吾則藥品的功效，很容易被　食冲淡。　譯自英文大美報閨秀弄情  白華　　“Hard　to　Get”　　華納公司出品　南京大戲院映　　說老實話，狄克飽惠爾所演的許多「歌舞片」並沒有給我很好的印象。他歌唱時候的面部表情和動作都是那樣機械的，有人說奈爾遜埃第歌唱時候沒有面部表情，狄克鮑惠爾是有過之，無不及。而且，或許他太「忠於藝術」吧，甚至並不選擇他所演的戲，如一個月前，南京映過的「春野牧歌」便是很好的例子。這樣「忠於藝術」的做下去，是會跑到沒落之途的。　　「閨秀弄情」中，狄克改變作風是確眞是事實，而且，這嘗試，他將收到比「歌舞片」更大的成功，雖然他和那些所謂「風流小生」比較，是還欠瀟灑　　「閨秀弄情」是一支典型的好萊塢戀愛喜劇，「女郞瑪格麗，駕車出走，中途汽油吿渴，至道旁汽車站加添汽油，因未携現款，汽車站職員比爾疑爲撞騙，逼令掃滌臥室，以償其値。女受辱之後，决設計雪此奇恥」。好萊塢的劇作者，是專替「花花公子」和「閨閣千金們玩托戲的，這位富商禮查士的掌珠瑪格麗就冒稱她父親的下女，和比爾佯談戀愛，使比爾執着全國公路建築汽車寄宿舍的草圖到處去碰壁……最後，也是一縷「情絲」，「飛繞」在比爾身上，「結爲夫婦」。　　這故事是旣平淡，而荒唐的。但是比爾的全國公路建築汽車寄宿舍的計劃，終於因他的百折不撓的精神，即充卑賤之役，亦所不惜，而達到目的，這種一吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人」，是我們最好的敎訓；允其是在爭取「最後勝利」的現在，我們應該堅持着這種精神的。對於資本家的「唯利是圖」，道裏也盡了諷刺的能事，富翁禮查士和銀行家埃特華特起初竭力避免比爾的糾纏，最後却不顧危險，到四十二層高樓上去和比爾爭訂合同，更因爲是喜劇，剝去了大禮服後的禮查士和埃特華特的醜態，是大快人心的。　　導演Ray　E　nright處理喜劇是有豐富的經騐的。他不但給全片勾劃了一個風趣無比的風貌，卽每一塲獻，也都充滿着濃厚的詼諧的情趣。如：開始時母女的口角；瑪格麗被逼掃滌比爾臥室時的爭吵及汽車鎖鍊；比爾往見禮查士及埃特華特的被拒；禮查士的比爾晚膳，瑪格麗喬裝下女，下女反居小姐之位；及最後的爭訂合同，都輕快，流利，兼以鏡頭的活潑，對白的風趣，「閨秀弄情一的導演可以說成功的。　　我特別喜歡的是對禮查士這一人物個性的把握，他的隨便，急噪，更由於打球，鬥劍，拳擊，角力等許多塲面的渲染，眞是弈弈如生，自然，Charles　Winninger的演技也是不能抹煞的。　　奧麗薇哈佛蘭似乎沒有演古裝片來得漂亮，但這里的富寂女瑪格麗演很不嬌憨可愛。啓事  佛　　姚其新先生鑒：接一月十五日大札，本報改送愚園路諸安浜諸安新邨十號，惟據送報人云，新地址找尋不到，是吾有誤，乞函示是荷。上海的小學教師  毅　　小學敎師，一般的說來，是敎育界中最淸苦的了。他們一天忙到晚，所得僅足以餬口。上海雖是個繁華的都市，可是小學敎師的淸苦，也不能例外。　　小學敎師的資格，有下列數種：（一）師範學校畢業生，（二）大學肄業生，（三）中學畢業生，（四）幼稚師範畢業生，（五）共他。上面所說的中學畢業生，包括高中及初中畢業生而言；幼稚師範畢業生，大都以擔任幼稚園敎員爲最理想的出路，而都是女性。其他一項，包括前淸秀才，及一般私塾出身者等。　　小學敎師的待遇，雖視學校的情形而不同，大致說來，在往常，公立的小學比私立的小學好。私立的小學，則視其校務的發達與吾，而異其敎員之待遇。一般的情形，敎課以鐘點多少而定其薪給。普通一二年的敎員，每小時以三角計，三四年的以四角計，五六年級的，每小時以五角計，所以一個小學敎師，每月的所得，普通終在三十元左右，每月能掙四五十元的，已是很少。一般幼稚園的女敎師，普通做主任的，可得月薪三十五元左右；助敎的，則在二十元左右。這是指公立的學校而言，私立的，恐怕終不及此數了。　　戰事以後，上海的小學敎師，除極少數外，受到了一個極大的打擊。他們的學校，大都是在戰區中，或是鄰近戰區的，因此一時不能開學，他們的生活，便發坐了問題。一二幸運的，尙能在不被砲火影響的學校裹暫得一枝之棲，一大半却都是失業而度着非常悽苦的生活了。後來環境稍稍平靜，有的小學在租界上向別的學校借了一二間臨時課室，繼續施敎，可是敎員待遇，眞是悽慘極了。有的小學敎員，每月祇得車馬費四五元，眞是苦極了，可是校畏還在嘆蝕本呢！有的小學，則在租界上另起爐　，重行開學，可是敎員的薪給，據說爲了房租的昂貴，而不得不打折扣了，往常能掙三四十元的，如今祇可得二十元光景　　目前因爲租界上人口激增，學齡兒童，隨之大增，小學敎育竟能特別發達起來，在戰區搬到租界上來的小學校也有，新設立的也有，有的本在租界上的，竟因學生衆多，而開設分校哩。可是當小學敎員的，未必因此而得生活稍爲寬裕吧。雨過天靑  包天笑　　第二回　林工師妙解標準化　金導員高談平等觀　　何佩玉道：「我們到那裏去吃飯呢一？林建成指着金小姐道：一她是個嚮導員，我們只跟着她走了，而且她在這個地方，比了什麼人都熟，今天當然由她請客，我們不用客氣，老實的擾她一頓」。金小姐道：一這一個小東道，我還請得起咧一。果然由金澹雲引導，到了一個地方，門面並不寬大，僅有一塊小小牌子，寫着「陵村餐室四個字。走進去，裏面的地方，倒極爲寬敞。又有一個大廣間，覺得裏面已經有好多人在內。何家姊妹到那邊窺望一下，金小姐便道：這裏不是我們吃飯之所，請跟我到這襄來。何雙玉抬頭瞧那大廣間的廊簷柱子上，也有一塊碑子，寫着一行字道：一第十八遺校合作會食堂一。因問道：一澹雲姊！這是另外一個吃飯的地方嗎？金小姐點點頭道：一這是餐室裹劃出了一個地方，給一個學校裹帥生會食之所，我們不好進去的一。原來中國自從戰事平定以後，設了七十二處遺族學校，都是中國家舉辦，連餐宿也由國家供給的。大塲這一個遺族學校，却是第十八遺族學校，從小學到高中爲止。倘然再要升學，便由遺族學校送到各大學校去了。除了一部份小學生，他們在學校的膳室裹吃飯，他們要人照料之外。中學生他們就在這裹，組織了個合作會食堂，由學生自治會管理，但許多師長，却也在這裹就餐，那便是他們取其名爲「第十八遺校合作會食堂」了。現在金小姐領了他們，曲折的到一個後軒，較爲淸靜。那後軒的窗外，是碧綠的一塊大草地，也就在會食堂的後面，是一班學生們飯後游戲散步之區。冉望過去，疏籬之外，便是一片稻田了。雖是個後軒，收拾得甚爲淸潔，上面也有一個橫額，寫着「稻香一兩字。下面更有一副對子，是鈔了唐詩兩句道：一開軒面塲圃，把酒話桑麻一。先是林健成看了，喝采道：一看副那副對子，和這個地方，眞是切極了。怎麼我從前沒有來過呢」？金小姐笑道：一這樣好地方，你怎麼會找到。今天也是靠了何家兩位姊姊的福，纔把你領到這裏來咧」。（二一）</p>

<p>自由談徹底派  王隱　　我們一向是死抱着中庸哲學的，但有時却又徹底得希奇古怪。　　從前文壇上常有一種現象，倘有人批評某種作品不好，或是說應該製作怎樣的作品的時候，便卽刻跳出一條好漢大喝一聲道：「你爲甚麽不寫？」這自然徹底得很。批評家應該先寫出一部自己理想中的作品，然後纔有資格批評別個。不過事實上這却是難辦得到的。於是結果只有批評家不開口，作品永遠壞下去或是簡直看不見完事，終於成徹底的取消。　　還有一種現象，倘有人指出某種舊派底文章依然是「八股型」的時候，便又會跳出一條好漢大喝一聲道：「那些只用洋典故的文章也是新八股！」這自然也徹底得很。但是舊的不行，新的也要不得，那怎麽辦呢？除了大家拉倒，再沒有另外的法子了。　　然而還不够，我們徹底的好漢有的是。要是你再不小心，指出中國人底某種缺點的時候，好漢便又要問你了。那話更加厲害，曰：「你是不是中國人？」這一來，倘是還想希望中國人好，你就先非入外國籍不可。這自然更是徹底之至，然而結果却取消了中國。　　這些還只是徹底派對付別人的論調，不待說已經是够警闢了。但最警闢的還是他們自己發出來的議論。不過有一個大的差異的是：對別人時是以好漢底姿態而出現，發揮自己時却以懦夫底嘴臉而露形。要舉例也有的是。　　幾年前，曾經有人爲溥儀悲哀過，說他總算是亡國的人，命運和我們一樣，應該大家給他充分的援助希望纔對。這種鼻涕眼淚的偉大的同情眞是徹底到頂點了。不過可惜的是要大家接受這一個建議，却首先須得根本取消民國底歷史，「徹底」地說，便還是非把中國取消了不可。而且事實卽刻也擺到了眼前：不久溥儀便回「國」從新做皇帝去了。他底「國」並沒有亡，似乎亡國的倒是我們自家底人。　　這事情算是已經過去了，或者用不着再提。然而現在却又有一批徹底派鑽出來了。　　這一批徹底派說的是：我們愛和平，我們應該爲和平而犧牲，只要能和平，怎樣都行。這種爲和平的奮鬥，自然越發是徹底得呌人沒有話講了。然而「莫作離亂人，寗爲太平犬，」爲了太平，當狗也不要緊。這徹底的結果，却是連人氣也給取消得乾乾凈凈。　　徹底是好的，但是徹底過了頭，却就沒有了「底」，而成了空的了，連自己也要等於一個〇。爬山  張鎭山　　太陽滑下了雲朶，村落中冒起了炊烟，時候是快要接近黃昏了。　　拖着細長的影子，在山野間行進，腦海裏都被現實的景象灌進了一層焦急。想到暮色將隨炊煙而來，心上就暗自在對黃昏詛咒，時間的迅速飛逝，又將使我們不能在預定的時間內，攀登那座高山了。　　加緊着步伐，走到山脚下，老强望一望手錶，就打起一陣哈哈說：　　「五點不到一些，時間還早哩。爬過這座山頭，就是平原，走得快，决不會誤點，明天正午準可趕到張家港，和左翼的側進部隊會合。」　　意外的興奮，就被這幾句話激發起來，一羣人都消失了飢餓，疲困，和焦急，鼓着餘勇，划開腿，跳過小溪，奔走着崎嶇的山路：那麽迂廻地，曲折地，穿過了松林，攀上了嶙峋的怪石。展開在眼前的小路，小得像一根繩子，由山腰間的凸　上一直拖到巓頂。斜射過來的太陽光，柔和地又在那狹窄的小路上壓出了荊棘的陰影，好像是田脊上的野花。　　山風撲下來，呼呼的響着，比碎裂的冰塊還要冷，尖削地捲過松林，刮着巖石，沙塵，樹葉，枯枝，殘草，交混地在山腰間旋轉，狂舞，有的掠過我們的頭頂，飛往山外，瀰漫到空際。　　這氣候是多麽惡劣呵！這山路又是多麽的險峻呵！然而我們，都有一顆勃躍的雄心；奔上前綫的勇毅與熱望，早就克制了大自然的恐怖。不顧一切的爬呀，爬呀！一百多個人拖成一條長的行列，像蛇似的蜿蜒着，一隻手握槍柄，一隻手撥開交夾在路面上的荊棘，草鞋擦着泥土，奏出一蒲…刺…」的前進樂曲。　　我仰望高峯，俯瞰深谷，遠眺着澎湃奔流的長江，心上就驟然重溫一句誓願：我若不破滅强敵，兩條腿將不把個空無所有的軀壳送返家鄕。　　「你說什麽？老鄕！」前面一個弟兄突然回轉頭來對我發問。　　「你看，這多麽美麗的江山呵！」　　「這是我們的責任！」他拍一拍胸脯，望一望長蛇般的部隊行列。　　「老鄕！眼前的景象就是榜樣哩。這麽險惡的山路，這麽嚴寒的狂風，一面是懸崖壁立，一面是深谷萬丈，但是，祗要勇往向前，轉瞬就可越過這種令人惶恐的境界，踏上平原。這正可象徵着我們的國運，不久的將來，就能澄滅敵軍，獲得最後勝利，多麽美麗的江山，不是依舊完整嗎？…」　　當另一個弟兄說完了這話時，我們又穿過了一重鉅石的罅隙，達到了峯頂，斜落的太陽已比我們低了許多。那條下山的小路上，也沒有人跡，也沒有獸羣，週遭盡是死寂的靜肅，祗有風刮打着岩石，發出尖銳的　　，像怒獸在狂嘯。　　下山的路上，風向背後吹來，我們被推送得像飛也似的由高處斜奔而下，眼望着平原上的　隊向我們打起的集中信號，心頭又浮上了一層異樣的喜悅：距離前綫　路程又减去一段了。霞闈主人的悲哀  　論面孔  熾强　　如果要寫一篇最完善而且又新的『辨姦論』，面孔當然是一張値得推敲一下的好材料。法律儘管讓他並無明文規定：－－一切行動之前或後，都要掛個標誌到面孔上來的拘束；但至少有些不能離開面孔的蛛絲馬跡暗示人間。要是能彀尋根究底的話，多少總有些東西來『洩漏』這個『天機』！　　我覺得，——朋友！等到這個時候才覺得已經够遲了，多少面孔已經鑄成一部牢不可破的廿四史了！——面孔實在該唾棄。唾棄嗎？不識時務！不識時務！看它動態怎樣方興未艾呵！　　那末似乎上帝不能辭其咎。這太多事的上帝，假使當初能彀忽略去這個部門，再不然，就是偷工减料一些也好：非但『六塵不染』，而且倒落得個『五蘊皆空』。　論：喜，怒，哀，樂，愛，惡，欲，等等麻煩的『浮雕』呢！　　事情並不簡單，也沒有像這麽爲了想像上的討厭而　可以踢開一旁去的來得容易：因此，觀瞻所繫的號稱『首善之區』的『首腦部』，便成功家喻戶曉的要裝它一裝的一塊『門楣』了。　　面面俱到，到了我的面前來，而且又那樣泛泛地浮地頭。在許多『各寺各廟各菩薩』的表情上，究竟告訴着一點什么意味呢？老實說：我一點也抓不牢，冒昧得很。然而這冒昧，該是並非我的疏忽。莫泊桑老早也感覺到材料並不簡單，雖然他還是要在老師指導之下，一張一張的寫出來，但心裏未嘗不想到這個舉世公認的　以處理的苛題，委實有點影響到卷子的完整。况且你那么板板六十四的寫去，寫完一張，却又鑽了一張出來。　　於是我想起人面不同各如其心，末世派別分歧，作品不一，更兼在原有的面孔上，大家都作興裝了一裝。且夫裝腔自然連帶還得作勢：一腔一勢，雖然亦足以暢叙幽情；但榨菜黃瓜豆腐冰淇淋，土司大餅，南燻北烤，蔚爲一爐，五里霧之外，猶有虛無飄渺也！我對於面孔論的材料的眞實性，馬上宣告脫幅，非華非實了。　　一年前，大槪是中原鼎沸的當口，也是自己進出於都市和農村之間的時候，就打定主意要寫面孔。終於因爲材料越弄越新奇，而且也爲着『面孔人人有，何必勞君提』而擱筆者再。　　這回看到一班漢奸的『玉照』而驚心起來，一張也沒有像戲台上打的秦檜式的那種臉譜，如果『按圖索驥』，非但『姦相』毫無，而且和『開國功臣』，倒並不兩樣。因此，我懷疑『玉照』，更因爲『照』瑕疵——其實蠻像的——而想到那班姦的『玉』，至少首先便裝過一回或者本來就富於伸縮性的『皮』了。　　普通在『面孔』之下，有一個所謂『城府』這是據一般觀察家的經騐談。便考據家又說：『城府甚深』的時候，能做到面孔的爐火純靑，絲毫不變。雖然一個『　開』　『笑逐』的作品，也許是一種『道地』的聲東擊西的烟幕彈而已，張伯倫要貫徹他的現實主義，這當口也戞戞乎難哉了！而我的面孔論的失敗，理有固然！　　中國寫面孔的文章，實在多得不可開交，而藝術的作品，首推一句『貌合神離』，干脆地把『城府』和面孔間的聯繫，攔腰斬斷。於是我逐漸的明白形而上的面孔，究竟不若形而下的『城府』來得　當。而小時候一　　　『點鼻頭』看誰臉先紅爲偷糖果的唯一倫斷，根本就不是科學的審判。這才使漢奸的面孔上都掛着一張『流通市面』『風行無阻』的表皮來！　　等到行勸一來，奸膽如天的出了醜，大家也都得流出這樣一句最忠實的批評：　　『這樣一張面孔呵！』『正是這樣一張面孔！』　　『這樣一張面孔，』你詫異嗎？傻子！老實人！自古以來，面孔就是靠不住的東西，『知人知面不知心！』『奴性』的『士　』，熙來攘往。　　手有套，脚有履，體有衣，就是股也未嘗沒有褲；獨有面孔缺乏遮蓋，就是人體上最不値錢而又最耐得起風　雨打或煎熬的東西，日久功深，鍛錬得凝固而且堅硬，於是：　　扳起面孔來賣國。　　扳起面孔來狗茍蠅　。　　扳起面孔來努力爲姦，　足先登傀儡之堂！　　你看：面孔上倒還不是像『開國元勛』一樣的神氣活現麽？此後値得開拓的『玉容』呵！　　——這裏許我熬不　要嘆一口氣——嗚呼！笑臉  次愷　　只下了兩天的雨，接着便是這樣和暖的好天氣，眞是想不到的。這時候還不出去玩玩，等什么時候——看影戲去！我這樣决定了。　　套上了大衣，向着街上就跑。到乘車的地方還遠呢，這一段路，陽光照得怪和煦的。我預備走走：慢慢地走，細細地想，更適意沒有了。　　孤島是個苦悶的地方，我想，只要看每個人的苦臉就够了。人人都是一副苦臉，那裏可以找得到一副可愛的笑臉呢？巡捕沒有笑臉，車夫更沒有；富翁們雖然有錢，在老醜的臉皮上只表示不滿足；商店裏的人，每天看到做小生意的窮鬼，更有什麽笑臉？除了到電影院去，實在再也沒有笑臉了。那裏，秀蘭鄧波兒會對你微笑，胡蓉蓉會對你表示心裏的快樂。　飛戾天者，經綸世務者，都會看得樂而忘返，我想，小明星的力量眞不小呀。　　等電車地方的石砌上，站着許多人，男的，女的；汽車從旁邊駛過，靡靡之音從店裏播出來；看起來，什麽都是很平淡的。　　在人叢中，突然看見一個穿破衣的女孩，裝着哭的樣子，向那些人們求乞。可是爲什麽今天他們每個人都沒有帶錢呀？女孩向這個人討一下，向那個人討一下，　個石砌幾乎走遍了。遠遠看來，好像一隻蜜蜂在花叢中這裏一鑽，那裏一鑽，——從來沒有人向身邊拿銅板，使她稍稍一等，使這迅速的動作稍稍停留片刻。　　當我踏上石砌，她已去遠了。一會兒，又跟着一個女子到這裏來。我從衣袋裏拿出兩個銅子，等她看見了我，舉手來表示給她對。這不勞而獲的兩個銅子，她是多麽的欣慰呀。兩脚很快　跑了來，像小學生在同學的歡呼中領獎品，像小孩子在母親的手裏拿糖果似的。——這時候，她不裝哭臉了，臉上是兩個可愛的小笑渦，伸出一雙墨黑的小手來接這小小的禮物。　　秀蘭鄧波兒的笑臉是假的，胡蓉蓉的笑臉也是假的——我不要看電影了，我不要看小明星了。這兩個銅子當入場券所看到的小明星的笑臉，却眞正而可愛——無意中我得到這個結論了。祭  馬蹄　　朋友，算你倒霉，　　沒　「良民證」，　　就犯了死罪。　　起先，你被那個矮子　　蹺起來一腿，　　你便像球兒那樣　　從那兒滾到這塊。　　你立刻忍住了痛，　　迅速地爬起來，　　跪在他的面前，　　扮着最卑鄙的臉，　　吐着不連串的語言，　　聲明你是「良民」，　　你是一個　　飯也吃不飽的苦百姓，　　沒錢買「良民證」，　　希望他把你放生。　　誰知，他說你爲甚跪，　　你一定是游擊隊。　　他用左手抓住你的頭發，　　用右手打你的巴掌：　　左一個巴掌，　　右一個巴掌，　　一連十多響。　　你鼻孔裏的鮮血　　直掛下來，像　　高山上的瀑布一樣。　　許是他的手心震痛了，　　他又抽出腰間的皮鞭，　　向你的週身濫鞭：　　從頭頂鞭到脚尖，　　從背後鞭到胸前。　　你越發慘呌，　　他越發獰笑；　　你越發掙扎，　　他越發濫打。　　自然，你的身子　　不是鐵做的，　　怎經得起這樣兇暴，　　終於像大樹被狂風吹折，　　你僵硬地栽倒在路邊。　　你的牙齒咬破了嘴唇，　　你的指爪嵌滿了泥塵；　　你週身是「野蠻的烙印」。　　誰知，誰知那矮子　　還嫌樂得不足，　　更用雪亮的刺刀　　在你胸前瞄上　　兩朶殷紅的花。　　於是他獰笑着走了。　　是的，他已完成了這幅　　不朽的傑作。　　朋友，請靜靜地等着吧：　　我們要爲你—　　爲祖國復仇！　　終有一天，終有一天　　會呌那些矮子照樣享受。　　（打死你的那個當然也在內）</p>

<p>游藝界好萊塢的中國風  楨　　全面抗戰一年半後的中國，在國際上確乎贏得了好聲譽，即以滿副勢利眼光的好萊塢影都而論，對於中國也刮目相看。各製片商紛把中國抗戰故事作為腳本，對於華籍演員所貢獻的意見，無不儘量採納，他們的地位真是昨日今朝大不同。　　即如派拉蒙公司，最近攝制「唐城霸王」King　of　Chinatown一片，其中雖然沒有美國性的地痞階級，也沒有拖辮子緾小腳等東方舊習在內，但主角黃柳霜女士還覺得不滿意，她要求中國人身份與美國人一體看待，無分軒忬。便擾出了三個條件：（一）取消該片中「過房爺」這類語詞，（二）以接吻代替「擦鼻」，黃女士的意思，擦鼻表示親熱是北極愛斯基摩人的陋習，怎麼可以拿來侮蔑中國人？（薩滿）製片商們一向以為中國人非醉生夢死便是蠢頭蠢腦的，這種觀念，應加以剷除。好啦，導演格林達見黃小姐理直氣壯，竟然一口答允照辦，並保證以後不再有同樣的事情出現。　　哥倫比亞公司近拍「視死如歸」一片，（Life　is　Cheap）由裴蒂富納瓊克勒等主演，以中日戰事為題材，暴露侵略者的醜惡。但該公司當局為避免將來發生糾紛起見，片中角色都由美人擔任，並採用象徴的表演法，避免牽涉到「日本人」字樣，而由惡魔烏將軍擔任反派，中國陳將軍擔任正派。據說這樣做法巳是非常大膽的了。　　導演之王的西席地密爾君，鑒于各方面都在擁戴中國人，近也有感於中，決計把他新片中一個中國勞動者的鏡頭，拖著小辮子作著奴隸裝束的樣子，徹底廢除了，而改攝摩登中國工人的姿態，描寫他們正在艱苦壯穆中築造一條鐵路，充滿了活潑可親的姿態。　　所以隨著時代的推進，好萊塢導演們的「中國認識」是全部改觀了，將進一步同情中國人，擁護中國人，一九三九年的影都，無疑地是「中國年」了。戲劇抗戰性  大圭　　戲劇雖小道，其有功社會，與教育有同等價值。處此孤島上，尤為重要。昨約友人觀崑劇於仙霓社，印象所及，非但教育社會，在此抗戰期間，有賴戲劇以激勵人心也。　　華傅浩之偕餉　是劇取材明末之抗戰，因軍餉奇絀，致有向國丈借餉之舉，與現代有錢者出錢，初無二致。國丈雖富有百萬家財，欲其散私畜以禦侵略者。殊非所屬，當個人享樂，一擲萬金無吝色。傳浩之王承恩，體貼入微，推為上選，念至「丈與國休戚相關，國安家安，國危家危」時聲淚俱下，足以警惕現時富翁，惜唱時似欠悲壯，十餘年前在某處聆俞粟應先生歌此，悲壯凄涼，兼而有之，繞樑三日，餘音猶在。次借及各王公大臣，大臣有主拒借，因敵人已至國門，出銀以助長抗禦，恐難容身，道白有「國家大事管他娘」句，與現時動搖分子及恐日病者，前後現世，是誠歷史重演，令人欲哭無淚者也。　　鄭傳鑑之別母　明將周遇吉，鎮守　武關，敵人攻關甚亟，遇吉別母以抵之，後聞關破，遇吉以職貫所在，擬自刎以殉，母曉以大義，始披甲出禦，已難收拾，是時遇吉妻自戕，子撞壁血死，母及家人，鎖屋自焚，祖孫三代，為國犧牲，可謂偉大壯烈。傳鑑之遇吉，手限俱到，火候純青，據老於崑劇者言，江南當推傳鎰獨步。惜嗓子稍沙，美中不足，身段做作，不亞於平劇余叔岩。華傳萍之遇吉母，盡職而已，沈傳芷之遇吉妻，方傳蕓之子，少表情，在緊張空氣下，無動於中，似不相宜。　　汪傳鈴之亂箭　是劇取材，緊接別母，遇吉　遇戰　不吉之關頭，猶思意圖抵抗，非至一人一彈而不止，身受亂箭，尚斃敵將數人，勇戰遇吉，後敵人四面圍困，始拔劍自殉，前年淞滬抗戰，我空軍某將士，因飛機誤降敵人陣綫，為敵所圍，盡殺槍彈，斃敵多人，至最後一彈，自飲而殉，可謂後先輝映，遇吉殉後，敵將念白中有「　將個個如周遇吉，我等焉能到此！」是暗示當今人人抱必死之決心，全面抗戰，定獲最後勝利。傳鈴之周遇吉，武工卓越，嘆觀止矣。　　前閱卓呆先生之崑劇割發代首，為刺戟性，我今所見之借餉別母亂箭，為抗戰性，且後者較前者，尤具積極性，是不可以不記。升社彩排一瞥  學漢　　名票徐慕覺高玄炳　演斬經堂精彩異常　　升社平劇團，係票界名流所組織，昨（二十二日）假奔波同鄉會大廳舉行第一次彩排，出演劇目至十三　之多，名票畢集，誠屬盛事。是日共分日夜二場，筆者承邵子詠南惠券，始於晚間九時後驅車前往參觀，飽聆雅奏。至則名票陳璧君暨雲女士之南天門，已成尾聲，而徐驀覺君主演之斬經堂甫啟幕。　　是劇徐君飾吳漢，扮相英姿，工架老到，而於在關查獲劉秀喜告其母，及奉母命囑釋劉秀，速斬南寗公主，其一種母命難違，天性純孝之至情，及念公主雖為奸人之女，但秉性賢淑，故提劍直入經堂，又不忍下手之意，演來令人無限感傷！噫，國劇之感人，深也如此，而非徐君老於舞台經騐，曷克臻此化境。　　南寗公主既自刎，吳母既自縊，吳漢為遵母遺教，當然去潼關，總鎮之偽職潛棄，而為光榮反正，輔佐光武中興，漢室人心之大快，尤其在今日之特殊情形下，可予一般漢奸痛下一針，故觀眾心理，莫不振奮，孰謂舊劇非鑑古證今哉！　　統觀全劇，而以名票高玄炳飾王蘭英（即王莽之女南寗公主）為配，高君行腔圓潤，如珠走盤，宜乎彩聲四起，余謂高君聲調頗具程派醇味，徐君則酷肖信芳，歎觀止矣。惜時晚壓軸為名票林大濟君之空城計，余恨未及窺佳奏之全豹焉。播音臺上之歌星白虹記孟小冬初現色相  缺水生　　曾嬪梅大王旋即說輻的坤角鬚生泰斗孟小冬，其藝術之佳在坤角諸伶中，實首屈一指，莫與比倫。雖往年馳名劇壇，尊之為坤角鬚生泰斗的恩曉峯，小蘭英等輩，亦難與比擬。　　她工譚派，係孟鴻羣之女，自幼從裘月祥習藝，因天質聰慧，能戲極多，譚派各劇，莫不會而精。尤其難能可貴者，較諸坤角唱時能避免雌音，不露坤角馬腳，且嗓音嘹亮，運腔圓正，做工又老到，較之以嫡傳譚派髪生為號召，有聲於時的名角，亦恐難望其項背。鑒此譚派人才凋零之時，極望她能好自為之，則劇壇之幸，亦即聽眾之福也。　　廻憶她初次登峯，顯露色相時，年衹九歲。那是滬上聞人關炯之先生，尚在職會審公堂，適為四十壽誕，親友特寫之假座哈同花園祝壽，並集雅歌集與久記社儲票友登台演戲。她客串鳥盆記，由馮叔鸞飾張別古，頗覺牡丹綠葉，曲方罷，彩聲四起，內行均稱為童伶中之傑出人才。迨她學藝告成，正式懸牌演唱，每至一處，傳佳評會於大世界京班懸掛正牌。其後赴平津各處再求深造，於二十五年重來滬　，出演黃金大戲院，更使內外行刮目相視，已達爐火純青的火候了。香島影劇  聶格自香港寄　　華南電影界對歷史古裝片的攝製，近亦風起雲湧，大觀影片公司宜傳三年的「呂布窺妝」（按　貂蟬），刻已積極從事，全部以二原色彩色攝成，攝製色彩片之機械特自美國新近購到，分國語，粵語，英語三種對白，已定華南的金　吳楚帆飾呂布，悲劇旦角黃曼梨飾貂蟬，此外有金城公司已完成「武則天」一片，南粵公司即正籌備攝製「西廂記」，由亦伶亦星的薛覺先，唐雪卿等主演。　　從中國旅行劇團分化出來的姜明等另組的中華藝術劇團，成立已一月餘，本月十七日特假中央戲院作第一次公演，日演魯迅學院王震之等集體創作「正氣歌」，夜演「得意忘形」，第二日日戲「得意忘形」，夜「雷雨」，共演兩日，賣座甚盛，導演歐陽予倩。　　本報前記陳雲裳與陳維周公子訂婚之說，　陳公子代表向記者聲言，並無具事，贈途汽車之說亦屬謠傳云。　　北平李麗抵港後，投　片商特請李主演「一代尤物」一片，因李不說粵語，故　粵語，由姚萍及中華藝術劇團團員合演，已經攝發。故都宮闈梨園秘史（八四）  徐慕雲　　辦科班是發財捷徑　　上面這個數目，是平均以每位三毛錢計算，每次照五百名看客合計的。如此一來，每月就可收入七八千元，何況他們還有堂會同全班赴津出演的好機會呢。他們科班的定章，學生沒出科的時候，一切收入分文不能支取，歸私歸班主飽入私囊。據說從前富連成的班主沈某，會淨獲三十萬金鉅款，後來因年紀大啦，不願再幹，才讓給葉盛蘭的老子葉春善接辦，在春善手裏，也賺到十好幾萬啦。前三年春善故世，遂由盛蘭的胞兄盛章等負責管理班中諸事。盛章是今日第一武丑，常以「盜雁翎甲」「醉丐」等唱大軸，每演必滿，座價日增，所以富連成格外殷實富厚了。　　我不懂上海一般聞人闊老，為什麼很願意拿錢捧京角，而卻不情願把這一筆錢省下來，集合點基本金，來創辦一所小科班。現在上海這樣多的難童，很可以挑選一般聰明俊秀並且讀過書學過國語的孩子們，使他們受到這種極有效的職業教育，這倒是一件又慈善又發財的好事兒。倘有人說舉戲非北平不可，這句話我根本就不贊成，試問皮黃戲是從什麼地方來的。四大徽班沒進京的時候，北平會有戲劇麼？這事我在世界書局出版的「中國戲劇史」裏說的很透徹。因此我認為假使上海能辦一科班，不光是不必北上邀角，受名角的脅制，并且上海人還有便宜戲看。丁光燮君的畫展  老凱　　丁光燮君舉行畫展於西摩路三七五號，我在百忙中去參觀了一下，他這次的作品可算是純粹以風景畫為主的一個畫展。　　丁君用筆的取景變化，及色彩的調和蒼老，都願出第一流藝術的氣魄。我追想著十八世紀法畫家彌勒（Millet）的作風，又懷念著彌勒先生數百幅「草堆」畫的故事；覺得丁君的作品。頗有相似之處。聞丁君將於本年赴法深造，前程未可限量。梨園彙訊　　上海伶界聯合會主席陳月樓，受聘為難民救濟會市民組勸募委員會第七十一隊長，現已召集各委員討論一切進行事宜，並通告各會員知照。　　更新舞台復興公司已積極發動，進行邀角巳推定筱振庭，於占元，王慧庵等辦理一切，由前後台經理常雲恆，宣剛決定大局。　　天蟾舞台武生高雪樵，昨日下午一時假座大雅樓歡宴自天津來申邀角之打鼓老劉長清，陪客邀請陳月樓，潘宏勳，劉遐卿等多人，極一時之盛。　　煙台開明大舞台文武老生呂君樵，昨日乘順天輪來申，任務係取樊梨花戲本（該台擬排演是劇）及邀聘角色。　　老生王俊宸由劉順來，何文鐸兩君介紹，與坤旦王艷秋結為百年之好，昨日上午文定，俊宸、鑽戒一只為禮，待明年二月過禮，三月結婚。棋苑  鮑子波編　陸承鑄校　　第十局　絕其歸路　　　張良佐擬　　紅先勝　　着法明日披露　　昨日顧此失彼著法　　砲四平一　士五退六　卒四進一　將五進一　砲一退一　馬八進七　馬二進三　馬七退八　馬三進五　馬八退六　馬五退七　馬六進四　馬七退六　將五退一　砲一進一　馬四退六　馬六進七</p>

<h3>Shanxi Chinese Troops Advance Triumphantly; Japanese Troops in Hejin Surrounded and About to Be Eliminated; Japanese Troops in the Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway Collapsed; Japan Dispatches Large Numbers of Reinforcements from Headquarters and Manchuria, Including Several Italian Mechanics and Observers</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing Telegram: A meeting of Japanese army and naval generals decided to transfer the Japanese army in Central China, up to the 15th Division, to Taiwan from Manchuria and Korea for training in order to cope with Chinese guerrillas and protect transportation lines. In western Shanxi counties, the Japanese are adopting a defensive posture, and the fighting is relatively more subdued than before. The Chinese are controlling Japanese troops on all routes with a siege and flanking attack strategy. The Japanese army transportation on the Tongpu Railway is very busy. Fierce fighting is taking place near Hejin, where the Japanese army has been surrounded. They are struggling in confinement, with all communication lines cut off by the Chinese army, and are about to be eliminated. The Japanese army, including the 24th, 108th, 109th, and 3rd Divisions, in the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, have collapsed after the Chinese army's counter-offensive. (Special telegram at 1:00 AM on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese military sources told Associated Press reporters that the Japanese troops between the Fen River and the Yellow River in southwestern Shanxi, who had been attempting to suppress the Chinese army for four or five weeks, have completely failed. The Chinese army has repelled the Japanese troops from places like Taikou (transliteration) and Longmen. The Chinese army has recovered Jixian, Daning, and Xiangning, among other places, on the east bank of the Yellow River. The Japanese army has retreated eastward to Lishi, Puxian, and Zhongyang. The extremely tense atmosphere in Shanxi two weeks ago has now been completely relieved. At the same time, victorious Chinese guerrilla forces continue to advance towards the Tongpu Railway. The Shanxi army is still preparing to make efforts in the area to completely eliminate the guerrillas. Therefore, the Japanese army in Taiyuan is busy concentrating the 5th Division of the Japanese army, as well as Mongolian and Chinese mercenaries, in order to launch a general offensive on Jixian and Daning on the east bank of the Yellow River. Japanese reinforcements are currently rushing to Shanxi from Japanese headquarters and Manchuria. On January 18th, twelve 15 cm caliber Japanese cannons passed through the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway to Taiyuan. These cannons came from Japanese headquarters. The Japanese garrison in Taiyuan and Yuci has been increased to prepare for surprise attacks by Chinese guerrillas. The Japanese army in Yuci has reached 15,000 men.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Defend Spain!</h3>
<p>Under the joint fierce attack of the Nationalist army and the Italian-German fascists, and under the illegal blockade of the hypocritical international "non-intervention" policy, the Spanish people's war against fascism has reached a very serious juncture. According to Reuters, the Spanish Nationalist army has been advancing continuously in recent days and is now only twenty miles from Barcelona. The Spanish people are fighting a bloody battle, desperately blocking the enemy's advance; in every corner of the world, the cries of "Aid Spain!" "Arms to Spain!" "Stop Germany and Italy!" are reverberating.</p>
<p>Spain is a bastion of peace in Europe and even the world, and it must be defended to the end. If Spain falls into the hands of the fascists, the consequences will not only affect Spain, nor only Europe, but also world peace.</p>
<p>First of all, if Spain falls into enemy hands, France will suffer a fatal blow; a large fascist army will appear outside the Pyrenees; France's connection with its African colonies will be cut off, and Mussolini can easily seize France's colonies; cooperation between Britain and France will also be cut off.</p>
<p>Secondly, if Spain falls into enemy hands, Britain will also encounter an unprecedentedly serious threat: because in this way, it will become a base for Germany and Italy in the southwest corner of Europe, from which they can attack Britain; it can control Gibraltar, cutting off Britain's connection with its lifeline, the Mediterranean; it can become a German stronghold for attacking Peot...</p>
<p>In a word, if the German-Italian adventure in Spain succeeds, they can turn from Central Europe to Western Europe; from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic; from Europe to Africa; their targets will not only be small countries, but also include large countries; not only Europe, but also Africa and Latin America.</p>
<p>Attacking Spain is the first joint attack of the German-Italian fascists; the Spanish people's fight against the German-Italian fascists is also defending world peace. Therefore, on this day of life-and-death struggle in Spain, breaking through the shackles of "non-intervention" and greatly aiding Spain is the common task of all progressive human beings in the world!</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the Spanish war could have been avoided from expanding and prolonging. Its expansion and prolongation are all the evil consequences of the "non-intervention" policy advocated by Britain and France. Under the pretext of preventing the expansion of the Spanish war, Britain and France advocated a "non-intervention" policy, depriving the Spanish government of the legal right to purchase arms from abroad, making it impossible for the Spanish people to arm themselves quickly, but the German-Italian fascists used the "non-intervention" policy as a talisman to continue to constantly interfere in the Spanish war.</p>
<p>Although the non-intervention policy is illegal, it can still help to end the Spanish war quickly if it can be genuinely implemented. But in fact, the British and French sides have implemented it too faithfully. For example, Britain restored the "Foreign Enlistment Act," prohibiting people from enlisting in Spain; France also sealed off the border with Spain. But Germany and Italy's interference in Spain has become even more intense and active. For two years, the German-Italian evil hands in Spain have never been loosened for a single day. Just looking at the calm accusations of Spanish Foreign Minister Valyte at the recent League of Nations Administrative Council meeting is enough to understand: "In November and December of last year, the number of arms shipped by Germany and Italy into Spain broke records. Since the Munich Agreement was concluded, enabling troops defending Central Europe to withdraw, the number of troops and armaments transported to the Nationalist army has greatly increased. Italian troops are now participating in the Catalonia offensive. The bombing of Barcelona on December 31st was actually assisted by the German and Italian air forces. In this way, it can be seen that the 'non-intervention' policy not only allowed the democratic countries to escape the obligation of aiding the Spanish people's anti-fascist resistance, but also protected the crimes of the German and Italian aggressors. The non-intervention farce directed by Britain and France has indeed not only betrayed the Spanish people, but also endangered world peace.</p>
<p>When Chamberlain visited Rome this time, Mussolini openly stated to him: "Italian troops will never withdraw until the Spanish Republican government is overthrown," and most of the troops currently attacking Barcelona are obviously Italian troops. At such a critical moment, if Britain and France do not promptly change their non-intervention policy and give the Spanish government legitimate aid, it would be tantamount to helping Germany and Italy harm the Spanish people.</p>
<p>Spain must be defended to the end. Spain, like China, is a bastion of world peace! Today, Spain has reached a critical juncture under the fierce attacks of Germany and Italy. All peace-loving and democracy-supporting people in the world must rise up to oppose the policy of appeasement of aggression, break free from the shackles of "non-intervention," and do their best to defend it!</p>
<h3>US Bans Arms Shipments to Japan; Public Opinion Increasingly Supports the Idea; Newspapers Praise Stimson's Proposal; Bitterman's Speech Criticizes Germany and Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) American newspapers unanimously praised the "Committee to Oppose Aiding Japanese Aggression" organized by Stimson. The Washington Star urged the government to ban the export of scrap iron as a way to curb wars of aggression in the Far East and Europe. The newspaper stated, "The strangest of our American actions is to continuously supply the basic raw materials for manufacturing military supplies to our supposed enemies. Today we supply these people, tomorrow they will become the tools they use to invade us. On the one hand, we talk a lot about peace, and on the other hand, we supply scrap iron to countries preparing for war. Can there be anything more contradictory than this?" At the same time, members of Congress have repeatedly received letters from citizens requesting the speedy enactment of legislation to ban the supply of American raw materials to Japan, Italy, and Germany. The State Department is paying close attention to this expression of public opinion, but it is not yet known whether it will follow the previous example of the public's automatic ban on the supply of aircraft to Japan, and the State Department will advise relevant commercial firms to ban the export of various raw materials to aggressor countries.

<p>(Washington) A non-monetary radio station here recently launched a broadcast debate on the international situation today. Many celebrities from all walks of life participated in the event. Senator Bitterman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, delivered a speech on the American foreign crisis, stating that the threats posed to the United States by the omnipotent countries, namely Germany and Japan, are becoming increasingly large. "The United States government and all its citizens must adopt all legal means to resist the expansion movements of these countries, except for resorting to war. But if resistance is ineffective, then we must prepare to use force to repel these countries. In my opinion, the ambitions and policies of the heads of state of the Nationalists, Hitler and the Emperor, are almost impossible to satisfy. As for Japan, the country's ambitions and the policies promoted by the military department over the years are aimed at conquering Asia and the islands of the South Pacific, which is extremely clear."

<p>(London) The Times newspaper here recently published an editorial commenting on the resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute passed by the 104th session of the Council of the League of Nations, saying, "In addition to engaging in health and non-political work, the League of Nations has gradually become a center for member states to exchange views and seek redress for grievances. However, judging from the proceedings of this session of the Administrative Council, there has been more improvement and it has become a general collection of human political consciousness. The various suggestions made by Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, on the 17th of this month, have been difficult for the Administrative Council to fail to act upon. A certain country has in fact formally or informally adopted various measures that are the same as a certain suggestion made by Mr. Gu, which is a real situation and is of great significance and cannot be taken lightly," it said.

Government fighter planes, previously used on the front lines, are now available to protect the city of Barcelona due to the shortening of the front lines. Recently, there have been frequent aerial battles between the two sides, with up to 50 fighters and bombers in the sky. One group of 40 Nationalist aircraft and 24 government aircraft engaged in a rare air battle. The Nationalists are clearly seeking to establish an aerial blockade line to prevent outside assistance, paying close attention to the coastal highway leading to France. (Reuters telegram, 23rd) Lerida Nationalist forces are now claiming that their front line is 15 miles from Barcelona, and that 150,000 troops are attacking the Robregat River line, which stretches from the coast to the northwest. The Nationalist forces are advancing an average of five miles per day in several positions, with the aim of cutting off Barcelona's lines of communication with France. (Reuters telegram, 23rd) Lerida The Nationalist General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating: "Our troops have occupied the city of Igualada and the port of Sitges on the Catalan front. The vanguard is now only fifteen kilometers from Barcelona, and the city has no defenses left." (Havas telegram, 22nd) Barcelona Nationalist forces on the Catalan front advanced on all lines today, concentrating their forces to launch a fierce attack on Martorell from Capellades and Piera in an attempt to break through the government forces' defenses. The mechanized units of the Nationalist forces in the Capellades area, under the cover of 100 tanks, advanced towards the government forces' positions. Although the government forces used anti-tank guns to stop their advance, they were ultimately forced to retreat due to the overwhelming firepower of the Nationalist forces. Nationalist forces in the Piera area also engaged in fierce fighting with government forces, lasting for six hours. The Nationalist forces launched six successive assaults, and the government forces were finally defeated and retreated towards Serramonton. In addition, a small detachment of Nationalist forces in front of Villanueva y Geltrú crossed the government forces' defense line and reached the vicinity of the port of Sitges (only 25 kilometers from the port of Barcelona). After being discovered by the government forces, they were immediately repelled. The fighting on all lines today was extremely fierce. The "Black Arrow" division of Italian volunteers belonging to the Nationalist forces participated in the battle on the Garraf heights. (Havas telegram, 22nd) U.S. Authorities Notify Citizens to Evacuate Barcelona The U.S. Consul General here has notified American citizens in Barcelona and Catalonia to prepare for evacuation. The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Spain has used radio to notify the U.S. destroyer Omaha, currently in Villafranca, to immediately set sail for Carditaes, 20 miles north of Barcelona, to transport 30 American citizens out of the country. (Reuters telegram, 23rd) Saint Jean de Luz A report was received here yesterday stating that part of the diplomatic corps stationed in Barcelona has left the city, and another part is in the process of departing. The French embassy has been emptied, and the furniture has been shipped back to France. (Haitong, 23rd) Barcelona Severely Bombed German and Italian Planes Participating Barcelona Nationalist aircraft bombed the city a total of more than twelve times yesterday, killing 49 people and injuring over 100. There were two more air raids this morning, and the number of casualties is still unknown. (Havas telegram, 23rd) Barcelona Multiple Nationalist aircraft have been flying in shifts since 1:30 AM this morning until 6:15 PM, fiercely bombing the city no fewer than ten times. 30 residents were killed, and 75 were injured. The wharves and the central district of the old city were the hardest hit. Many houses were completely destroyed, and many homeless children were wandering the streets, in a truly tragic state. (Havas telegram, 20th) Valencia Multiple Nationalist aircraft fiercely bombed this port this morning, carrying out a total of three air raids. The British freighters Stanholm and Cardiff, as well as the French freighter Charles Mely, were anchored in the harbor and were affected. One sailor on board the Charles Mely was killed, and six were injured. (Havas, 22nd) Barcelona When Nationalist aircraft fiercely bombed this port today, the British ship African Voyager, which had recently arrived here from Oran in French North Africa loaded with grain, was also affected, taking several hits. Half of the ship has already sunk into the water. (Havas, 22nd) Valencia The British merchant ship African Seafarer was hit by a bomb during an air raid yesterday. It is reported that six crew members were killed, most of whom were Greek. Four other British ships were bombed later this week. A hole was blown in the side of the Deckle Brook, and seawater poured in. The deck of the Hunters Lee was badly damaged. The Dover Abbey, which was hit on Saturday, was hit again yesterday. (Reuters telegram, 22nd) The Spanish Question American Attitude Scrapping the Arms Embargo Widely Discussed (Washington) Regarding the issue of whether the U.S. arms embargo on Spain should be lifted, since former Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull advocating for it, members of the U.S. Congress have re-raised the issue and are actively discussing it. Most believe that the U.S. attitude should shift depending on how the French National Assembly and the British government decide on this issue. Florida Democratic Senator Pepper told reporters: "Since the European democracies are not prepared to help their sister country, it is not possible to hope that the United States will lift the arms embargo. The United States is closely watching the attitude of Britain and France towards the totalitarian countries. In short, if these countries cannot take a more resolute attitude, then how can we, 5,000 kilometers away, express sympathy to the Spanish Republican government?" North Dakota Republican Senator Nye, who introduced a bill to repeal the arms embargo in the previous Congress but failed to pass it, recently told reporters that he is prepared to re-introduce the bill in this Congress. "The American people, whether Republican or Democrat, largely believe that Spain has become a battlefield between democracy and autocracy." Although the environment in which the Spanish Republican government finds itself is very difficult, it is not hopeless and has the possibility of continuing to resist for several months. According to a certain newspaper, President Roosevelt and the State Department's sympathy for the Spanish Republican government has grown deeper. Former Secretary of State Stimson believes that the President has the power to repeal this arms embargo, and I personally share Stimson's sentiment. The President had the power to issue this embargo before, and now he has the power to repeal it." (Havas telegram, 22nd) The Spanish Situation Deteriorates France Pays Close Attention (Paris) Premier Daladier received Foreign Minister Bonnet this afternoon and immediately discussed the situation caused by the advance of the Spanish Nationalist forces towards Barcelona, lasting for three quarters of an hour. (Havas, 22nd) (Paris) After arriving here from Geneva yesterday, Spanish Republican Foreign Minister del Vayo met with French Foreign Minister Bonnet this morning, accompanied by the Spanish Ambassador Pascuia. It is reported that the discussion focused on the situation affected by the advance of the Spanish Nationalist forces towards Barcelona and the issue of refugees from the Republican government's territory seeking refuge in France. The French government has already drafted various special measures for the refugee problem to properly accommodate large numbers of refugees entering French territory. (Havas telegram, 23rd) (London) News from here last night stated that in recent days, Britain and France have been exchanging views on the political and diplomatic consequences of a Spanish Nationalist victory. It is understood that France is deeply worried because Franco's victory would completely destroy the balance of power for the French Republic. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the defense of its eastern border, France must concentrate a large number of troops on the Pyrenees border to prevent any eventuality. French officials are also quite concerned about the possibility that the financial and political influence of Germany and Italy may gain an advantage in Spain. Britain believes that Germany and Italy should not drag Spain into the European arms race. After the victory of the Spanish Nationalist forces, Mussolini may make concessions to France by withdrawing Italian troops from Spain. In addition to Tunisia, the Suez Canal, and Djibouti, the Italian Prime Minister will also ask France to clarify and guarantee its future policy towards Spain. London political figures acknowledge that these opinions exchanged between Britain and France are the necessary result of the Spanish Civil War. (Haitong telegram, 23rd) Burgos The Nationalist side claimed yesterday that 22 tanks were transported into Spain to assist the government forces through the French border towns of Jundras. Officials in these towns were ordered to allow the military supplies to pass through. (Reuters telegram, 13th) (Paris) The Communist Party recently held a national congress here, and Deputy Perri delivered a speech, stating that the country's foreign policy must be guided by the following: (1) Aid the Spanish Republican government, (2) Resist fascist countries, (3) The treaty signed by France with the republics of Syria and Lebanon in September 1936, which allows these republics to declare independence (this treaty has been approved by the French Senate and National Assembly), should be ratified, (4) Democratic countries must unite to deal with the current threats. The connection between France and the Soviet Union should be promoted. The large-scale anti-aggression movement launched in the United States should also be supported. It must be known that to this day, all totalitarian countries have encountered various difficulties. As for Italy, it has exhausted its resources due to the Italian-Ethiopian War and is now sending troops on a long expedition to interfere in the Spanish Civil War, and its economy is already exhausted. As for Japan, since using force against China, its financial burden has been increasing. As for the Soviet Union, its economic difficulties are also increasing. (Havas telegram, 23rd) Ciano Visits Southern Country and Returns Releases Statement on Trip Belgrade, Capital of Southern Country Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has been hunting in the Southern Country and holding talks with government officials for several days. Last night, Prime Minister Stoyadinovich hosted a banquet in his honor and awarded him the Grand Cordon of the White Eagle. Foreign Minister Ciano then departed for home at 12:00 noon. Prime Minister Stoyadinovich and other dignitaries went to the station to see him off, and crowds outside the station cheered to pay their respects. (Havas telegram, 23rd) Capital of Yugoslavia, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinovic have concluded their talks and are scheduled to return to Rome this evening. Regarding the talks, government officials released a statement stating that the implementation of the 1937 Italo-Yugoslav friendship treaty has been very satisfactory. The current diplomatic policies of both sides are based on this treaty as one of the basic elements. The economic institutions of the two countries are also complementary and should develop mutual trade relations. In addition, "various issues in the European situation that are related to both Italy and Yugoslavia have also been discussed by the two countries' cabinet members. They immediately reiterated that they are determined to step up cooperation in order to reach an agreement with the relevant countries and to enrich the peaceful order in this corner of Europe. Regarding this, the neighboring countries of the Southern Country have recently made efforts, and the Southern Country's government has responded to them. This is also based on the constructive spirit of the Rome-Berlin Axis in Italy and Germany, and they will work to participate in this cooperation." Informed sources here commented that the last paragraph of the statement refers to Hungary's desire to be closer to the Southern Country, and the Southern Country also has the same desire. However, it must first obtain the consent of Romania. (Havas telegram, 21st) Capital of Yugoslavia After the visit of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, political figures here declared that relations between the Southern Country and Hungary have improved. However, how close the two countries can actually be remains to be seen in a few weeks. At that time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will visit Italy, and the Permanent Political Council of the Balkan Entente will meet in the capital of Romania. Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinovic will personally attend the meeting, and all issues related to Central Europe and the relations between Romania, the Southern Country, and Hungary can be discussed and decided with the Romanian government authorities. (Havas, 23rd) (Rome) Italian officials are very satisfied with the results of the talks between Ciano and Stojadinovic. It has been learned that several resolutions were reached during the talks: (1) Italy and Yugoslavia will establish close cooperation in the economic sphere. (2) An Italian Chamber of Commerce will be established in the capital of Yugoslavia, and a Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce will also be established in Rome. (3) A large-scale Italian automobile manufacturing plant will be established in Belgrade, with Yugoslav participation in the investment. In addition, a credit loan was also considered, with Italy providing Yugoslavia with a credit loan to purchase Italian military equipment worth 150 million lire. According to reliable sources, Italy may provide the Southern Country with other types of credit loans, not limited to military equipment. (Haitong News Agency telegram, 23rd) Austria A Disturbance Occurs Berlin Still Denies It The capital of Switzerland Suddenly it was reported that a disturbance occurred in the Austrian province of Germany. It is said that military movements within the province are frequent, which is very abnormal. Residents bordering Switzerland and the province are alarmed after hearing the news, and the authorities in the state of Sigal have strengthened security on the border. However, the actual situation is impossible to confirm, and the competent authorities have not obtained any credible information. (Havas telegram, 232nd) (Berlin) The rumor that a disturbance occurred in the Austrian province was denied by officials here. (Havas telegram, 23rd) Hungarian Catholics Oppose Pro-German Policies Capital of Hungary Since Prime Minister Imrédy has been pursuing a pro-German policy in foreign affairs and implementing anti-Semitic policies in domestic affairs, it has caused dissatisfaction among the Catholic Church in the country. In terms of foreign affairs, Catholics regret the government's abandonment of its moderate policy and its decision to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. In terms of domestic affairs, they are unhappy with the government's order to transfer 400 primary schools run by Hungarians to the control of Germans. 70% of these 400 schools are run by the Catholic Church, and parish priests have refused to comply with the order to transfer them, citing public opposition. In addition, Catholics have also contacted the Vatican, hoping that it will intervene and work with the government to reach a compromise solution and change the current anti-Semitic laws. In short, Catholics hope that Jews who convert to Catholicism or marry Catholics will not be subject to these laws. If this wish can be satisfied, then the anti-Semitic laws will fundamentally lose their racist nature. (Havas telegram, 22nd) Restrictions on Re-export of Export Goods (Hong Kong) In order to control the consumption of export goods, the government has newly formulated three articles on restrictions on the re-export of export goods, which have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be implemented by the customs. The main points are: For export goods, except for those exempt from foreign exchange settlement, they shall not be re-exported without a special domestic sales certificate issued by the Ministry of Finance.

<p>Overview of the Singapore Military Base By John Gunther Translated by Wang Hongsheng The Singapore military base, known as the new Gibraltar, has recently been completed. It was prompted by Japan's "Twenty-One Demands." As early as 1915, Japan made it clear to China that Japan would be a formidable rival to Britain in the Far East. In 1919, Admiral Jellicoe suggested creating a British Pacific Fleet with Singapore as its base. He argued that in addition to cruisers, there should also be a battle fleet in the Far East, and that Britain should establish a "Western Hemisphere" naval policy. In 1922, the Imperial Conference met in London, considered Jellicoe's suggestion, and decided to build the Singapore military base. By 1922, the Washington Naval Limitation Treaty was signed, establishing naval ratios between the great powers, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was abolished. At this time, public opinion in Britain said that this new military base was superfluous and would only provoke Japan and cause him to be suspicious. Those who upheld justice believed that this new base was a moral violation of the Washington Naval Treaty, which prohibited the construction of fortresses or naval bases east of 110 degrees longitude, and Singapore was only six degrees away from this restricted area. Some even believed that Britain intended to cause trouble, but this was later officially denied. Construction of the base began in 1924 and was not fully completed until fifteen years later—February 14, 1938. Singapore is an island, 27 miles long and 14 miles wide, with a causeway across the Johor Strait connecting it to the mainland; it is located at the tip of Malaya, where ships to China and Japan must pass, perfectly controlling the artery of east-west traffic. During the construction, rumors spread that people were conducting espionage activities, so precautions were very strict, residents in the restricted area were ordered to relocate, and all construction workers had their fingerprints taken. The naval base is in Sembawang, on the north coast of the island, twelve miles from downtown Singapore. Not far east of the naval port is the air force base. Singapore has a total of three designs: one drafted by the British Army, one drafted by the Navy, and one drafted by the Air Force. The so-called Singapore base includes all three. In theory, this base is under the jurisdiction of the Army, with General Dobbie as commander-in-chief, whose authority is above all naval and air force officers stationed in Singapore. During construction, it was necessary to move mountains and fill rivers, spending a total of six million cubic feet of earthwork; as for filling in low-lying swamps, it cost eight million cubic feet of earthwork. To the right of the island are countless white-colored oil drums, containing one million tons of gasoline. Each drum is cast into a saucer shape, which is said to prevent the spread of flames in the event of an explosion. Underground are armories, so rich in storage that the entire base could be turned into powder with more than enough. The naval base covers an area of 21 square miles. Its main decorations are two huge and extraordinary docks, one floating dock and one repair dock. In the event of naval action, if ships are damaged, even the largest warships can enter the dock for repair. Without the Singapore base, damaged ships would have to go all the way to Malta for repairs, and by the time they returned, the war might already be over. This floating dock is 900 feet long and 200 feet wide, making it the third largest floating dock in the world. It can carry any huge battleship and still float; 60,000 people can stand on the bottom. This dock was built in England, disassembled into several parts and towed from Wallsend to Singapore, a distance of 10,000 miles. A total of eight Dutch tugs were used for towing, making it one of the great spectacles of the modern navy. The repair dock is slightly larger than the floating dock, 1,000 feet long, and took six years to complete at a cost of five million gold dollars, using 4.5 million cubic feet of concrete. Any ship in the world can be placed at will, and the most recent test proved that it can hold 68 million gallons of water. The floating dock can be moved elsewhere when necessary, such as Hong Kong; the repair dock cannot be moved. Near the two large docks are machine shops, power plants, storage warehouses, and one of the largest cranes east of the Suez Canal. Everything is doubled, except for the crane, so enemy planes must do two sets of work if they attack—assuming they break through the air defense line. Singapore's only drawback is that there are many reefs in the vicinity, making submarine activities inconvenient, but enemy submarines will certainly encounter the same difficulties near Singapore. Singapore's air force base is also very powerful, with three different military airfields and one civilian airfield. The civilian airfield was opened in June 1937 at a cost of US$5.25 million and was built on a newly reclaimed piece of land on the beach, so land and seaplanes can be used for both purposes. This airfield also has the advantage of being very close to Singapore's prosperous urban area, and it only takes seven minutes by car to reach it. One of the main military airfields also has facilities for both land and seaplanes, with over 20 miles of excellent water surface for seaplanes. No fewer than 40 air force squadrons are stationed at the base, and reinforcements can be flown in from India if necessary. Technically, Singapore is indeed a strong fortress, with 7,000 troops stationed there in peacetime, and more importantly, those mysterious forts and many gun emplacements, scattered on the easternmost tip of Singapore Island and on many small islands in the Strait. These small islands are home to many artillery teams and engineers. It is said that the defenses include not only 15-inch guns with a heavy range of 25 inches, but also the most powerful 18-inch guns in the world. The construction costs of the Singapore base are considerable, and strangely enough, this huge sum of money came from opium. According to official estimates, the total cost of the base is US$80.55 million, of which the naval base alone cost US$38.5 million to US$45 million. The floating dock is valued at US$4.85 million, and the towing fee from Wallsend to Singapore is US$1 million, including US$50,000 in Suez Canal tolls. The Sembawang air force base is valued at US$3.55 million, and the two military airfields are valued at US$1.75 million each. However, unofficial estimates are even higher. If the salaries of officers and soldiers and all indirect costs are included, the cost is no less than US$250 million. The sources of this sum of money are diverse; the Straits Settlements supplied the land for Sembawang, valued at US$750,000, New Zealand contributed US$5 million, and Hong Kong contributed US$1.25 million. Australia did not contribute money, but built a navy. The rich Malay Peninsula above Singapore is divided into directly and indirectly ruled parts. The directly ruled part—directly under the jurisdiction of the British headquarters—supplied US$1 million in cash and the No. 2 Royal Air Force Squadron, valued at US$1.5 million. The political independence of the indirectly ruled part is not superior to that of the directly ruled part. The Sultan of Johor supplied US$2.5 million. In total, the above-mentioned donations amount to US$21 million, slightly less than one-quarter of the total value of the base. Also, by 1933, the Straits Settlements had supplied another 60 million local currency (one local currency dollar is equal to US$0.58). After 1933, it provided a constant annual donation of 4 million local currency, plus a special fund of 1.5 million local currency in the last three years. Therefore, the total contribution of the Straits Settlements to the base is no less than 81.5 million local currency, equivalent to US$47.5 million. Adding the cash provided by the Straits Settlements to the above-mentioned donations, the total is US$68.5 million. Subtracting this number from the total value of US$80.55 million, the difference is US$12.05 million, which is what the British headquarters spent from its budget. It's really extremely cheap. Apart from the annual maintenance fee of US$2.5 million, the Singapore base has requested very little from the British headquarters. Twenty percent of the total revenue of the Straits Settlements comes from the sale of opium. This sale is a government monopoly, with the British buying raw opium from Iran or India and making it into a paste, packed in small metal tubes. One local currency dollar can buy one Singapore tael (equal to one and one-third ounces) of raw opium; while one tael of paste costs twelve local currency dollars. The profit is considerable, but it also has the meaning of prohibition in the tax, deliberately raising the price to reduce sales. The sale of the paste is strictly controlled; only registered addicts can buy it, and a doctor's certificate is required to join the ranks of addicts. A few years ago, the government, considering that opium transportation might be prohibited by international joint action, promulgated an opium substitute fund method, extracting 10% of the annual opium tax for separate safekeeping. This fund has now accumulated to 30 million local currency, and it is no longer necessary to increase it. Therefore, it is said that those 35,000 registered smokers simply bear one-fifth of the funds that the Straits Settlements has assisted in giving to the base. On the day the base was completed, the arrival of the US fleet caused panic among many people in the world. In this Sino-Japanese war, Japan's power is increasingly advancing southward. The completion of the Singapore base will certainly give Japan a considerable color. Soon, Britain declared, "If necessary, Britain is prepared to lease all the equipment of the new naval base to the United States for application." In other words, if a war breaks out, Britain will welcome the Americans to Singapore. On the one hand, the Americans are happy to do so, because west of Hawaii, she has no place to repair large ships. Once something happens in the Far East, Singapore's dock can meet her needs. According to the most reliable military observations, the base can only be attacked by the enemy on the northern mainland. A maritime attack is simply impossible, and an air raid can only damage the base but cannot occupy it. If the enemy attempts to occupy Singapore, they can only land infantry in Malaya or Vietnam, and then move south. This is the reason for increasing military airfields in these two places. Singapore's most valuable feature is its location, only 1,578 miles from Manila, 1,674 miles from Hong Kong, and 3,345 miles from Yokohama. Although Japan is building an important air force base in Taiwan, it must add at least 3,000 miles of firepower to launch a full-scale naval attack, and such a distance already exceeds the limits of modern expeditionary warships. In fact, the main target of naval warfare is commerce, not enemy ships. One of the important tasks of the Pacific War is to cut off the traffic of Japanese merchant ships, plus a blockade, which can lead to Japan's death. To achieve this goal, Singapore is the ideal place. Furthermore, Singapore's neighbor is an absolutely safe place. Vietnam can be said to have no political activities, such as national movements. Imagine putting Britain's military base in Egypt, Iraq, or India. The political situation there is a very serious problem. And Singapore has the most perfect air force facilities, which is much more convenient than Gibraltar, which has no good airfield. Therefore, concentrating military power in Singapore has several functions: giving the British Navy an oil depot and repair dock; giving Hong Kong a backing of military power; and protecting Australia, Colombo, and Calcutta; and establishing an armored defense stake in the center of</p>

<p>Central Police Department Chinese Deputy Inspector Huang Fusen Seriously Wounded in Sniper Attack</p>
<p>The assailant fired more than ten shots, hitting three.</p>
<p>Stray bullets wound apprentice. Police are secretly pursuing the murderer.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 11:30 AM, on the northern section of Yu Qiaqing Road in the Public Concession, a criminal sniper attack occurred targeting Huang Fusen, the Chinese Deputy Inspector of the Criminal Division of the Public Concession Medical Department. A young boy was also injured by a stray bullet. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Victim</p>
<p>Huang Fusen was originally from Suzhou, 21 years old, and lived at No. 67 Anyi Village, North Xizang Road, Public Concession. He joined the工部局 (Gong Bu Ju, Public Works Department) Police Department in 1925 and has been employed there for 13 years. He is usually cautious and astute in his work, and therefore is highly valued by the police authorities. He has been a detective in the Huishan Police Department for many years. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the Concession authorities, in view of the endless assassinations and terrorist cases within the Concession, decided to gather competent officers from various departments to form a Criminal Eighth Division specifically responsible for such cases. Huang was transferred to this division at that time to serve as the Chinese Deputy Inspector. However, recently, due to the gradual decrease in the workload of this division, the authorities abolished it in January of this year and merged it into the First Division. Huang was also transferred to the First Division and continued to serve as Deputy Inspector.</p>
<p>Hit by Three Bullets</p>
<p>Huang usually travels in his own rickshaw. Yesterday morning, around 11:30 AM, he was returning home from the office for lunch in his rickshaw when, near Guling Road on Yu Qiaqing Road, three strong men in short coats and long robes suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Each was holding a Mauser pistol and fired simultaneously at Huang Fusen. Hearing the gunshots, Huang knew something was wrong and immediately told the rickshaw puller to stop so he could find a place to hide. However, the assailants chased after him and continued firing, totaling more than ten shots. As Huang got out of the rickshaw, he was hit by three bullets and fell to the ground. Seeing their goal achieved, the assailants let out a shout and fled north towards Xiamen Road. By the time the nearby police officers arrived after hearing the gunshots, the perpetrators had long disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Westerner Offers Urgent Assistance</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller, witnessing his boss injured, cried out loudly and ran to No. 22 of the area, the police station, to report what had happened and provide details of his boss. The officer then realized what had happened. Upon inspection of the injured man, they found that he was bleeding profusely and unconscious, in critical condition. The officer, fearing that calling for an ambulance would delay treatment and endanger his life, negotiated with a Westerner driving his own car who was passing by the intersection, requesting urgent assistance. The Westerner readily agreed to the request and helped lift the injured man into the car and sped to宝隆(Bao Long) Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. At the same time, they telephoned the police station to report the incident. The Xinzha Police Department immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to search for clues, but found nothing except a few empty bullet casings on the ground. These were taken back to the police station for examination as evidence for the investigation.</p>
<p>Serious Injuries</p>
<p>After being taken to Ward 306 of宝隆(Bao Long) Hospital by car, the hospital doctors washed the wounds. They found the following: one gunshot wound on the left shoulder, with the bullet passing through the flesh from the neck to the shoulder; one gunshot wound in the back, with the bullet exiting from the front chest; and one gunshot wound in the left lower back, with the bullet remaining lodged in the abdomen, which was the most serious wound. There was no certainty that the bullet could be removed, and this depended on his physical condition and recovery. Based on the current situation, the injuries were extremely dangerous. Huang's younger brother, Fugen, a detective at the Huishan Police Department, rushed to the hospital with his family after receiving the report. The police department, for security reasons, also dispatched detectives to the hospital for protection and to offer condolences.</p>
<p>Intensive Manhunt</p>
<p>As for the motive behind the assassination, there are conflicting rumors. Some say it was due to his diligence in his duties, which caused resentment from criminals. However, the credibility of this remains to be investigated and will be revealed in due course. Currently, the police department is taking this case very seriously, with all officers mobilized to hunt down the perpetrators. In addition, a young boy from Jiangbei, named Xue Xiaosizi, 14 years old, an apprentice at the久丰(Jiu Feng) Shoe Store at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Wenzhou Road, was injured by a stray bullet that hit the bone of his left foot but did not pass through. He was taken to宝隆(Bao Long) Hospital for treatment by his colleagues. Fortunately, the injury was not critical, and he is expected to recover.</p>
<p>Right Kidney Removed</p>
<p>(Further Report) Huang Fusen's condition remained unchanged until midnight yesterday. He was recovering well. After examining the gunshot wound to his right lower back, doctors at宝隆(Bao Long) Hospital found that the bullet was lodged in his kidney. Because of his strong physique, they performed surgery at 3 PM that afternoon and discovered that his right kidney had been shattered by the bullet. They removed the right kidney and resealed the wound. Afterwards, he fell asleep, and his body temperature was normal.</p>

<p>Prison Guard Commits Fraud for Money</p>
<p>Extorting Money from Inmates' Families</p>
<p>His greed led to arrest and prosecution</p>
<p>Xiao Jin, a Guangdong native, was arrested on December 16th of last year for private trafficking in opium. The First Special District Court sentenced him to three years and six months in prison. Unexpectedly, on January 19th of this year at 8:30 AM, Huang Zhangquan, 23 years old, a native of Pudong residing at No. 328 Baoding Road, and a guard No. 159 at the华德路 (Hua De Lu) Prison of the Public Works Department, went to Xiao Jin's home at No. 20 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, impersonating a nurse from the工部局 (Gong Bu Ju, Public Works Department) Hospital. He told Xiao Jin's son, Genmin, that his father was ill in prison and had asked him to bring a message requesting two tins of British brand cigarettes, four packets of 八卦丹(Ba Gua Dan, a type of herbal medicine), and a reward of 20 yuan. After speaking, he produced a note to prove that it was written by Xiao Jin in prison. Xiao Genmin, without suspicion, gave him everything he asked for. However, after secretly inquiring, Xiao Genmin found out that his father was not sick in prison and became suspicious, realizing that Huang Zhangquan had committed fraud. Just as he was about to investigate, Huang, driven by greed, believing he could take advantage of the situation, went to Xiao Genmin's residence again at around 8 AM the other morning, showing another note and attempting to extort 50 yuan. He was reported to the Chengdu Road Police Department, who dispatched detectives Zhang Kuidong and 西探(Xi Tan) Tuile to arrest Huang Zhangquan and take him into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, stating that the prisoner had not been transferred, and fearing that the defendant might have committed other crimes, requested a postponement. Judge Xiao questioned the defendant, Huang Zhangquan, who confessed that he had been a prison guard at the华德路 (Hua De Lu) Prison for five months, earning a monthly salary of 24 yuan. He claimed that a prisoner had instructed him to do this. Judge Xiao reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained for seven days for further investigation and questioning.</p>
<p>Former Huizhong Hotel Director Sun Zhiqi Sued by Divorced Concubine</p>
<p>Represents Daughter in Claim for Educational Support</p>
<p>Denies Huizhong Hotel Sales Contract</p>
<p>Court Orders Both Parties to Present Evidence for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Sun Zhiqi, the former owner of the Huizhong Hotel, was involved in a lawsuit with his concubine, Wang Wenyun, last year, resulting in a payment of 50,000 yuan and a formal separation. Their daughter, Fengyin, was placed in Wang's custody. Later, Sun published a statement declaring that he would not be responsible for any of Fengyin's actions outside the home. Wang, however, claimed that the 50,000 yuan Sun had paid did not include educational support for their daughter. Furthermore, Sun had sold the Huizhong Hotel to his adopted son, Sun Bosheng, last autumn without Fengyin's consent. This sale, she alleged, was orchestrated by Sun and his son Bosheng, along with his nephew Sun Guangyuan and his in-law Jin Yigeng. Therefore, she, as Fengyin's legal guardian, filed a lawsuit against Sun Zhiqi, Sun Bosheng, Sun Guangyuan, and Jin Yigeng.</p>
<p>Filing a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi of the First Special District Court convened a hearing. The plaintiff, Wang Wenyun, was absent due to illness, and only the defendant Sun Bosheng appeared. Lawyers for both sides presented the names, ages, and addresses of their respective clients. Sun Zhiqi's lawyer stated that he was from Changshu. Sun Bosheng claimed that he was from Shaoxing. The court pointed out that even though Bosheng was adopted, as Zhiqi's biological son, father and son should share the same place of origin. Bosheng claimed that they made a mistake. The plaintiff's lawyer, Li Mian, then began to state the</p>
<p>Purpose of the Lawsuit</p>
<p>The lawsuit had five points, summarized in two parts. (A) Request to order Sun Zhiqi to pay 35,000 yuan for Fengyin's educational support, stating that Fengyin, currently 13 years old, requires 5,000 yuan per year in educational expenses. Until she reaches 20 years old, there are seven years remaining, so her father should pay 35,000 yuan. The 50,000 yuan her mother received did not include educational support for their daughter, and her mother's debts amounted to 50,000 yuan. Therefore, she has no remaining funds. As for Sun Zhiqi's notice stating that he would</p>
<p>Not Be Responsible</p>
<p>for Fengyin's actions, it had a different meaning. (B) Request to declare the sale of the Huizhong Hotel invalid and confirm Fengyin's 40,000 yuan stake in the hotel. It was claimed that Sun Zhiqi's son, Bosheng, was adopted and that Fengyin was his only daughter. Zhiqi had millions in assets and had gifted them to his daughter in a written agreement. After the separation of Fengyin's biological mother, Wang Wenyun, Bosheng and Guangyuan, coveting the wealth, flattered him. Zhiqi, misled by slanderous words, published a notice canceling the gift. However, the gifts given by relatives and friends when Fengyin was born, totaling 40,000 yuan, were later invested by her father in the Huizhong Hotel as capital.</p>
<p>Engaging Daughter</p>
<p>to Jin Yigeng's son, this 40,000 yuan stake was transferred to Jin's name, allowing Jin to serve as chairman after the Huizhong was reorganized into a limited company. Sun Guangyuan was only a manager at the Huizhong. Bosheng's purchase of the Huizhong last autumn was illegal, both because Bosheng lacked the financial resources and because Guangyuan was not authorized to sell it. Therefore, this sale was illegal and should be declared invalid, and Fengyin's 40,000 yuan stake should be confirmed. Sun Bosheng stated that his purchase of the Huizhong's brand and assets was valued at</p>
<p>100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>and did not include the land. Sun Zhiqi's lawyer, Wang Shang, then argued against the five points of the lawsuit, stating that the 50,000 yuan previously given to Wang included the daughter's educational support. Huizhong was originally founded by the defendant alone. Later, because Sun Guangyuan provided years of assistance,</p>
<p>he gifted the hotel to him, and Guangyuan reorganized it into a limited company. The plaintiff had misunderstood. The four-wan stake he claims</p>
<p>cannot be questioned</p>
<p>Lastly, Jin Yigeng's representative lawyer, E Sen, stated that Jin Yigeng had never served as chairman of the Huizhong. Although Sun Zhiqi, because his Qian Zhuang (money exchange shop) had collapsed and he feared it would affect other assets, decided to change the Huizhong into a company and transfer a 40,000 yuan stake to Jin's name, with Jin acting as chairman, Jin did not accept the position. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that they had documents to prove this point and could not agree. The court, finding the case complex, ordered both parties to present evidence for a hearing at a later date.</p>
<p>Stealing Bicycles</p>
<p>Nine Accomplices Arrested</p>
<p>Over Thirty Bicycles Recovered</p>
<p>Victims Can Identify Their Bikes at the Chengdu Police Station</p>
<p>Wang Asan from Wuxi stole a bicycle belonging to Gao Shengguan at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Jing'an Temple Road at 9:20 AM on the 19th of this month and tried to escape. Gao saw him and reported to the police. Wang and the bicycle were taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Detectives Wu Junqing, Chen Yaoting, and Zhou Yushan investigated and learned that Wang specialized in stealing bicycles in the Public Concession and that he had many accomplices, committing dozens of crimes. Based on his confession, they arrested seven accomplices: Dai Agen, Zhang Debiao, Wang Agen, Wang Daerzi, Wang Shihhuai, Dong Rushi, and Li Yu. They also arrested Fang Licheng and Huang Maochang, who received the stolen goods, at the Hongfei Bicycle Shop at No. 184 Shanhai Pass Road. They recovered over thirty bicycles, which were taken to the police station. This morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. After questioning, Judge Xiao ordered them to be detained until the 30th for further investigation. Since the owners of the recovered bicycles have not been identified, anyone who has had a bicycle stolen can go to the Chengdu Road Police Station to identify it.</p>
<p>Drug Offenders Executed in Guerrilla Areas</p>
<p>Private Executions Already Occurring</p>
<p>The Hua Fang Guerrilla Team and the New Fourth Army's Mass Self-Defense Corps in Pudong have received orders from their superiors to implement drug prohibition in their areas. Notices have been posted everywhere, stating that any drug offenders caught with three convictions will be executed by firing squad; two convictions will result in a term of imprisonment; and one conviction will result in two months of imprisonment and mandatory rehabilitation to prevent the enemy from poisoning the guerrilla areas and harming the healthy population. Recently, drug offenders Hu Gengen, Xiao Asan, and two others from Tangjiao Zui Town were found guilty of drug use and trafficking for the fourth time and were beyond pardon. They were paraded through the streets before being executed by firing squad at noon in the center of town. Currently, not only are hard drugs severely punished, but opium is also being subjected to mandatory rehabilitation in accordance with the National Government's anti-opium laws. Anyone opening an opium den will be severely punished to prevent invaders from harming our compatriots with both guns and drugs.</p>
<p>Guerrillas Seize Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>Four Japanese Soldiers Missing</p>
<p>Abandoned Truck Left Behind</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, around 9 AM on Sunday morning, four Japanese soldiers were seized from a military truck by Chinese guerrillas at the corner of Hongqiao Road and Robber General Road. The details are unknown, but the truck was abandoned by the roadside all day. On Sunday night at 10 PM, a group of armed bandits robbed several households in a village on Robber General Road, but the loot was minimal. They then kidnapped a seven-year-old child, but abandoned him on the roadside for fear of attracting attention due to his loud crying. The child was sent home by the doorman of a foreign residence. Due to the frequent robberies in the Hongqiao Road area in recent days, Japanese soldiers extensively searched the villages in the area yesterday.</p>
<p>Three Years Without Conjugal Bliss: Underlying Secrets</p>
<p>Wasted Youth, Mental Anguish</p>
<p>Mediation Fails, Separate Lawsuit Filed</p>
<p>Zhang Junying, a lawyer and local resident of No. 202, Masnan Road, French Concession, has been sued by his wife, Zhang Yuying (25 years old, from Taicang), through her lawyer, Tao Muxia, in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court. She is seeking mediation to dissolve the marriage, return her dowry, and compensate for damages. The petition states that since their marriage in October 1935, they have had no conjugal relations. After repeated questioning, the husband has remained secretive and unforthcoming. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the husband has a hidden illness that prevents him from consummating the marriage, leading to a serious mistake that has wasted the wife's youth and caused her mental anguish. As the days go by, the plaintiff cannot continue to sacrifice herself. Therefore, she is seeking mediation to dissolve the marriage, return her dowry, and compensate for damages. Based on the petition, the court, presided over by Judge Sun Pengxian, convened a mediation hearing yesterday. The husband, Zhang Junying, was absent, and only the plaintiff, accompanied by her lawyer, appeared to present the facts. The court declared the mediation unsuccessful and instructed the plaintiff to file a formal lawsuit.</p>
<p>Apprentice Is Naughty and Vicious</p>
<p>Attempts Arson</p>
<p>Fortunately, a Tenant Discovers and Extinguishes the Flames</p>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months by the Court</p>
<p>Li Defu, 20 years old, from Nanjing, was an apprentice at the Mahjong parlor run by Song Fusheng at No. 162 North Jiangxi Road. He was known for being naughty and vicious. On the upper floor of the building, Li Cuiqin, a 21-year-old woman from 廣實(Guang Shi), lived in a separate room. Her fiancé, Liang Yinglin, often visited her. Li Defu suspected that they were</p>
<p>Whispering Sweet Nothings</p>
<p>or engaging in improper behavior in the pavilion. He often went upstairs to peek and observe their movements. Two weeks ago, Liang discovered this and beat him before leaving. Li Defu harbored resentment towards Li Cuiqin and plotted revenge. Recently, Liang Yinglin had not been visiting, so he had no opportunity to act. In a fit of anger, he devised a malicious plan. Yesterday morning at 3:50 AM, he secretly took a bottle of kerosene (costing ten copper coins) and some wood shavings and rosin that he had bought during the day to the staircase landing on the upper floor. He poured the kerosene on the steps and</p>
<p>Lit the Rosin</p>
<p>The flames quickly spread, intending to murder Li Cuiqin by burning her to death. He then went downstairs and tried to flee. The fire was discovered by Wang Xiaoniu, a tenant who lived in the same building and was a</p>
<p>Seller of Opium</p>
<p>Seeing the flames, he rushed upstairs and extinguished the fire, preventing a disaster. After a while, Li Defu returned to the building and was questioned by the two landlords, Luo Zhushi and Li Cuiqin, as well as several other tenants. Frightened, Li</p>
<p>Jumped Out the Window to Escape</p>
<p>Injuring his head and feet, he was unable to stand. The landlord, Luo Zhushi, reported the incident to the汇司 (Hui Si, foreign) Police Department, who sent detective Shen Dehui to the scene. He took the apprentice to Renji Hospital for treatment before sending him to the First Special District Court at 9 AM. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for endangering public safety under Article 173, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, requesting a severe punishment. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned him thoroughly and sentenced Li Defu to three years and six months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<p>Earthwork Contractor Accused of Abandonment</p>
<p>Liu Zichuan, a Guangdong native who previously ran the聚丰 (Ju Feng) Earthwork Company in the Nine Acres area (36 years old, residing at No. 85 Baoyu Lane, French Concession), is now being sued for abandonment by his concubine, Zhou Suzhen (25 years old, from Luodian), through her lawyer in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. According to the plaintiff, the defendant seduced her into an affair in August 1932, when she was 19 years old, while her parents were away in their hometown to find a wife for her brother. They have been living together since then. At first, they were on good terms, but recently, he has become indifferent and neglectful, and she has suffered in many unspeakable ways. She requests an investigation. The defendant, accompanied by his defense lawyer, appeared in court and admitted that he had taken the plaintiff as a concubine in August 1934, and they have been living together ever since. She smokes opium and white powder, and he gives her 50 cents a day for expenses, which increased to one yuan after the war. She spends it all and goes out without returning, staying in Yanziwo. He has not abandoned her and still wants her to come home. The court reviewed the statements and ordered the defendant to post a 500 yuan bond and adjourned the hearing to February 1st. If he cannot provide the bond, he will be detained.</p>
<p>Gas Explosion on South Side of 盆汤弄 Bridge</p>
<p>Bridge Catches Fire, Quickly Extinguished</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, an underground gas pipeline broke at the corner of North Suzhou Road and North Shanxi Road in the Public Concession, causing a gas leak. The自来火 (Zi Lai Huo) Company immediately sent workers to repair it.</p>
<p>They opened the iron plate on the ground and suddenly heard a rumbling sound below. Then, there was a loud explosion, with flames shooting out of the hole. The盆汤弄 (Pen Tang Nong) bridge on North Shanxi Road was also set on fire. A fire brigade was immediately called, and they arrived and extinguished the fire, and turned off the gas. The fire on the bridge and in the hole was soon extinguished. During the fire, the bridge was closed to traffic for about two hours. Two workers were burned on their faces and chests, but the injuries were not serious enough to require hospitalization.</p>
<p>Robbery at White Russian Gambling Den in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The大陸报 (Da Lu Bao) reports that a robbery occurred at a gambling den run by White Russians on亿定盘 (Yi Ding Pan) Road early this morning (23rd), injuring a White Russian named An Keman. The details are as follows: Shortly after midnight, five bandits, each armed with a Mauser pistol, broke into the gambling den with the intention of robbing the large number of foreign gamblers at the roulette table, including several women. Seeing the robbers with guns, they all fearfully raised their hands. One or two people tried to resist, and the robbers fired a shot, injuring a White Russian employee named An Keman. At the same time, a White Russian tavern owner, who had his own Mauser pistol, took it out and fired a shot into the air. The robbers, apparently thinking that the gambling den was guarded and that they were outmatched, fled. A few minutes later, police officers from the Public Concession Police Department and puppet police arrived at the scene and took the injured man to the hospital. Although he was shot in the back, his injuries are not serious, and he is expected to recover.</p>

<p>Yang Lingmei: Virtuous Woman or Dancer?</p>
<p>Accuses Ballroom Server of Seduction and Abandonment</p>
<p>Court Orders Investigation, Defendant Released on Bail</p>
<p>Yang Lu氏(Shi), a 51-year-old woman from Ningbo residing at No. 26 Sanqing Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, acting as the legal representative for her 17-year-old daughter, Yang Lingmei, has filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court against Zhu Xiasen (19 years old, former server at the Hollywood Ballroom), a fellow townsman residing at No. 24, Alley A, No. 52, Daxi Road, Western Shanghai, accusing him of seduction and abandonment.

<p>to Watch a Movie, then lured to the 中南 (Zhong Nan) Hotel, opened room 219 and stayed for four days, then changed to room 231, stayed for six days, and finally moved to room 57 of the春江 (Chun Jiang) Third Inn for three days. She was then found by her sister, Yang Hongsheng, who intended to take her to the police station. The defendant repeatedly begged to marry Lingmei and wrote a written agreement, then dispersed. However, the defendant regretted his decision and married another woman on December 4th,</p>
<p>Abandoning Lingmei.</p>
<p>She is requesting a trial under Articles 240 and 239 of the Criminal Code. Based on the lawsuit, Judge Liao Yuan of the court convened a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff, mother and daughter, and their lawyer testified to the previous events. The defendant, accompanied by his defense lawyer, also appeared in court and admitted to having a relationship with Lingmei, but claimed that Lingmei was a dancer and denied the charge of seduction.</p>
<p>He Claimed to have Stayed at a Hotel</p>
<p>The note was coerced and written by her sister along with hooligans, who dragged the defendant to the春江 (Chun Jiang) Third Inn. The court reviewed the statements and ordered a postponement to February 1st for further investigation and testimony. The defendant was released on bail of 1,000 yuan; if he is unable to provide the bail, he will be detained.</p>

<p>Modern Life	Whooping Cough: The Great Calamity of Winter for Children's Lives (Shen Zhongjun) Whooping cough, also known as "startling cough," mostly affects children around the age of seven. The symptom of this disease is that when it doesn't cough, it's fine, but once it starts coughing, it's a series of violent coughs, causing the child's face to turn red, ears to redden, sweat to pour from their forehead, and even vomiting of food. The veins on the head bulge, and the eyeballs protrude, causing extreme suffering. The most terrifying thing about children suffering from this disease is the complication of pneumonia. Generally, pneumonia accounts for the majority of deaths among children suffering from whooping cough. Moreover, the course of whooping cough is very long. The child's lungs are not only damaged, but their overall health is also severely affected, leading to gradual weakening. Even if pneumonia does not occur, there is still a risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis (consumption) later in life. Parents must pay careful attention to nursing their children. Medical knowledge in our country is not yet widespread. Whooping cough is often seen as a symptom of a cold, or people mistakenly administer miscellaneous drugs from the market, or neglect treatment altogether, resulting in a shockingly high number of young lives lost each year. Those who are cultivating national strength should pay attention to this. Editor's Note: When treating whooping cough in children, never administer miscellaneous drugs haphazardly, as the harm can be unimaginable. According to the experience of various physicians, administering 'Lung Vitality' PhlthWeal internally to children suffering from whooping cough is the safest and most appropriate treatment. This is because 'Lung Vitality' effectively clears the lungs, resolves phlegm, and stops coughing, and its lung-strengthening effect is well-documented. Therefore, it can prevent dangerous symptoms such as pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, 'Lung Vitality' contains no anesthetic agents, making it safe and worry-free even for infants. Modern Middle School Students A Tragic and Serious Problem (Lu Zhicheng) Currently, there are two kinds of Chinese people in dire straits. One is the refugees who are suffering from the iron hooves of the Japanese and the scourge of bandits. The other is the middle school students who are burdened with the responsibility of studying. The threat faced by refugees is immediate hunger, cold, and death. The threat faced by middle school students is the destruction of their health and the resulting decline of the nation. If readers think this comparison is excessive, then please take a look at the following representative facts. (1) A parent once told me about his experience studying in middle school. He said: 'The suffering we endured in middle school was even worse than in elementary school... Usually, classes were held from 8 AM to 4 or 5 PM every day. The homework assigned by teachers each day took another four or five hours... When I was in middle school, I was confident that I could work hard, but because of rushing homework, I went to bed late and got up early every day. Even weekends were extremely busy. Even bathing and haircuts were done in a great hurry... Studying like this, by the time I was in my second year of high school, I suffered from severe neurasthenia... By the time I graduated from high school, my strong physique and lively spirit had both turned into weakness and dullness.' (2) A high school girl told me: 'I can't finish my homework until 1 AM every day. But if I go to bed too late, I can't fall asleep. I often can't close my eyes until 3 AM. Imagine, only sleeping three hours a night, how can I not have headaches and fevers and get sick? Don't think I'm an exception. In fact, there are many, many classmates living the same life as me!' (3) A middle school student wrote to me saying: 'The most difficult thing about the current middle school curriculum is mathematics. On average, there are six to eight hours of math class per week. The problems left after one hour of class, if a student is a bit slow, will take five hours to complete. Almost every week, I have to spend seventeen or eighteen hours on math... Someone who doesn't like math has to work hard to graduate and pass the entrance exam. Most of the time is spent on this one subject, and the result is not good. On the contrary, I have neglected the subjects I like and don't have time to look at them... There is so much schoolwork that graduating from this school is worrisome enough. Adding an entrance exam makes some students rush desperately. I know a student who, the year before last, was so afraid of failing the entrance exam that he didn't sleep for ten nights. Later, feeling that his spirit could not hold up, he took morphine injections. In the end, he still failed two subjects. How cruel! If you don't work hard, you can't graduate with so much homework. If you work hard, your spirit is limited, so you have to take morphine injections.' This time, I didn't do any public investigation. I just took the crisis of middle school students as material and discussed it with friends. What I found was that neurasthenia has become a serious problem for middle school students. That's why I say: The suffering of middle school students now is even more profound than that of the refugees in front of us. Young students are the vitality of the nation and the backbone of the country and society. The mission and tasks they bear are undoubtedly very important. If they are bound by neurasthenia, their spirit will be depressed, their consciousness will be uncertain, their physiology will be abnormal, and their ideals will be inconsistent with their lives. As a result, their courage is frustrated, their vitality is reduced, and they are dazed all day long. Sometimes they have headaches and insomnia, and sometimes they have palpitations and dizziness. Almost their whole body is sick, causing Promising young people - turn into useless cripples. In this extraordinary period when the life of the nation is about to be destroyed, in this emergency juncture when the history of the nation is about to be cut off, how to help this large group of middle school students who have been ravaged by neurasthenia is indeed an urgent problem! Although the threats faced by middle school students are more serious than those faced by refugees, the methods of helping them are simpler and easier than helping refugees. According to the instructions of most health experts, young students should often take a kind of 'MemoryNeurotic' brain tonic to enhance their brain power and replenish new energy. In this way, they can always keep their minds clear and their spirits strong, and they can cope with difficult and heavy courses without fatigue. Because 'MemoryNeurotic' brain tonic is the great nerve tonic of the times. In addition to being rich in various vitamins, proteins, and lecithin, it also contains hormones extracted from the healthy animal brain marrow and spermatic gland hormones extracted from the spermatic glands. These precious ingredients are not found in any other similar tonics. Therefore, 'MemoryNeurotic' has excellent effects and is indeed a powerful tool for overcoming neurasthenia. Young students should prepare it for their future good fortune! But there are many inferior medicines on the market. Be sure to specify 'MemoryNeurotic'. Humankind's Desire: The Problem of Reversing Aging How to Prevent Early Aging for Those in Their Forties and Fifties How Can Elderly Men Stay Vigorous Despite Aging? Translated by Shen Zhaoquan From the American Fitness Newspaper, Volume 12, Number 10 A person needs at least twenty years of education after birth before they can serve society. Therefore, people in their forties and fifties, precisely because they have spent much effort and received many lessons, are able to acquire some knowledge, experience, and life skills. Just when they are most happy in life and their careers are of the greatest value to society, old age, unknowingly and naturally, gradually arrives. The dreadfulness of old age is that as soon as it arrives, no matter who it is, they will lose their ambition and become pessimistic about everything. It can be seen how terrible old age is. There is nothing more tragic in the world than this. The changes of aging, reaching old age, are an inevitable tragedy for everyone. However, the age of aging varies. Some people do not notice it until they are ninety or a hundred years old, while others show signs of premature aging in their forties and fifties. Biologists tell us that people who are chronically overworked, such as literary figures, politicians, scientists, and large entrepreneurs, are prone to aging. In addition, people who lead a generally romantic life, such as those who indulge in sexual desire and abuse alcohol and tobacco, can accelerate aging and shorten their lives. French professor Voronoff of the Paris University Medical School said: Although people cannot avoid death, they can live longer. According to the common rule for animals, human life should reach seven times the age of their physiological development period—if we assume twenty years as the age of completion of development, then the ideal age for human lifespan is actually one hundred and forty years. Anyone who dies before reaching this natural lifespan is called a premature death. And in fact, there are frequent records of people living to be one or two hundred years old in newspapers. (Translator's note: The congratulatory message for Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday published in this newspaper recently can also fully prove that longevity is indeed possible). However, they are relatively rare. And the reason why they are rare is mostly because the elderly lose their resistance to diseases in their youth. For example, the same case of pneumonia, young people often recover from it, while old people are prone to heart failure and death. If the elderly can maintain the vigor of their youth, then they will not fear diseases and can expect to live a long life. So how can we reverse aging and regain youth? This can be remedied by science in modern times. Qin Shi Huang sent strongmen to the east to Fusang to seek the elixir of immortality, which is a famous story in history. There are also people who believe in Buddhism and Taoism, swallowing cinnabar and refining elixirs, hoping to live as long as turtles and cranes. It can be seen that the desire for "longevity" is something that everyone desires, both ancient and modern. However, these ideals are mostly superstitious and ignorant. Now there are many people who, by middle age—that is, in their forties and fifties—show signs of premature loss of vitality, decline in energy, and soreness in the lower back, making them unable to work. These people are called premature aging—progeria—although they take all kinds of tonics on the market, the results are invariably disappointing. Most of them are strenuous and fruitless. They no longer know that the life functions of the human body are very ingenious. The causes of aging are very complicated and cannot be remedied by simply taking tonics or getting tonic injections. It is necessary to have a basis in advanced academic theory, and a meticulous and complex preparation is required to transform life—to achieve the ideal wish of not aging. Since the French biologist Brown-Sequard and the German professor Berthald of Kaidingyuan University advocated the theory of reversing aging, scholars around the world have successively risen up to study it. Recently, the anti-aging agent "Apopleyxin" created by Dr. Hentze, a German expert in anti-aging techniques, has caused a global sensation. After extensive and widespread trials, it is generally recognized that the drug does have the effect of reversing aging and regaining youth. From now on, premature elderly people around the world can have a technique for longevity. This anti-aging agent "Apopleyxin" is the culmination of Mr. Hentze's thirty years of painstaking research. Its ingredients include various hormones from the heart, brain, kidneys, and puberty glands of animals, various vitamins, and ingredients including deer velvet. It concentrates the essence of Western, animal, plant, and mineral medicines in one furnace and is formulated using the most complex scientific methods. It can be said that everything related to human life is included. When we take it, it can make the overall life functions lively and vigorous, and the vitality does not decline. According to the reports of biologists from various countries, modern humans are at their peak of energy in their thirties and forties, and enter old age and decline in energy in their fifties and sixties. Now, try using this anti-aging agent "Apopleyxin" on general premature elderly people. After taking it for ten weeks, the only phenomenon is that it can restore the vigor and interest of their youth to seventy-year-old men. It can give generally premature aging adults a strong physique again. The most amazing thing is that elderly women can also have a rosy complexion and wrinkles disappear after taking it, restoring their youth and vitality. Old men with premature sexual desire can have ancient wells with heavy waves. Now let's summarize the effects verified from various aspects and give a brief description below: (1) When used by elderly men and women, it can make vitality strong, energy undiminished, the body warm, not afraid of the cold, the ears and eyes clear, and the steps light and agile, without the suffering of dizziness and blurred vision. (2) When used by adults in their forties and fifties, it can prevent neurasthenia, make the mind clear, improve memory, and provide sufficient energy, so they are not tired of work, and can extend the age of activity in society to seventy or eighty years old or more. (3) This agent has the effect of activating blood and removing wind. It can treat all kinds of muscle and bone soreness, numbness, hemiplegia, waist pain, etc. The effect is better than other common medicines. Elderly people often take it, and these pains will never occur. (4) This agent has an extremely perfect heart-strengthening effect. For all elderly people with heart failure, palpitations, uneasiness, heart deficiency, easy fright, heartbeats, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, various heart diseases, and difficulty breathing, it is effective immediately after taking it, and it can nourish the heart meridian when used for premature aging, and always keep the heart comfortable and sleep safe. (5) This agent contains lactic acid bacteria preparations, which are effective in eliminating various harmful pathogenic bacteria in the intestine, preventing blood poisoning, and preventing arteriosclerosis. It can also relieve constipation and clear the intestines, aid digestion, and treat various gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, this lactic acid bacteria agent is especially popular in recent theories for preventing aging and prolonging life. (6) This agent can regulate the circulatory force of the blood and can reduce excessively high blood pressure, so it can prevent heart rupture and stroke (cerebral hemorrhage) with special effects. (7) The Good.CaloiDiuretine in this agent is the latest discovery of special effects for the treatment of arteriosclerosis and obesity. It is effective and reliable for preventing stroke (that is, cerebral hemorrhage), and cannot be compared with ordinary seaweed preparations on the market. After writing about all the effects of the anti-aging agent "Apopleyxin" here, I have to tell readers: Humans are born to die. This is something that everyone cannot deny. What is said here about "Apopleyxin" is by no means to achieve the art of immortality. However, its effect can indeed promote the vigorous vitality of all parts of the human body, strengthen the power to resist diseases, and prevent and eliminate all the inducements that destroy life. Therefore, it can prevent the rapid progress of aging, so that people who should not age do not age prematurely, and extend their age of activity. They can serve society for a few more years. Even people who have reached old age are also old and strong, and can continue to live a thriving life to the ideal age. Therefore, many scientists, writers, and large entrepreneurs can extend their activity—spiritual and mental—by taking this kind of "Apopleyxin", although they are seventy or eighty years old, they still look as strong as they were in their thirties and forties, and are therefore able to complete their work and hopes. This is what anti-aging agents contribute to mankind, only pay attention to one of the above. If you don't take daily hygiene to heart, that won't work either. Wise readers should make their lives conform to the laws of nature. At a minimum—always within the realm of possibility—strive to eliminate bad habits such as overeating, excessive sexual desire, and excessive smoking and drinking. At the same time, use anti-aging agents to make up for vitality. This is the best way to prevent premature aging—which is also the most scientific way to prolong life. (Note) "Apopleyxin" is a kind of silver oral tablet. Men and women can take it after the age of forty. No matter whether they are sick or not, or whether their constitution is strong or weak, it is beneficial and harmless to any aspect of the body. This product has just arrived in Shanghai from Germany. Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun Department Stores' Western medicine departments and all high-end pharmacies are selling it. There is a very detailed Chinese and English instruction manual attached to the bottle, which can be read. Translator's Notes Lung Disease Where Are the Special Medicines? (Physician Gu Hongda) Regarding the treatment of lung diseases, there are still no special medicines that can directly enter the lungs to kill bacteria today. This is generally recognized by scholars around the world. After chemical analysis, the medicines advertised in the market as having special effects often contain no special drugs, and even contain morphine and other anesthetics. If patients mistakenly use these miscellaneous drugs, they may feel that the pain is reduced at the time, but they do not know that the root of the disease has not been removed, and the symptoms are still secretly progressing and spreading. If it breaks out suddenly, the condition will become more serious, and it will be too late to regret it. Therefore, administering miscellaneous drugs haphazardly is the most risky action. From the standpoint of modern medicine, the internal medicine that is suitable for the principle of treatment and suitable for patients to recuperate at home is 'Lung Vitality' Phith Weal. This product is a modern organ preparation recognized by medical science. Its efficacy revives the lung's vitality and produces a natural defense function and anti-tuberculosis element, exerting the effect of natural healing. Therefore, after the patient takes it, he feels the lungs are clear and refreshing, the phlegm is thin and loose, the cough and asthma are reduced, the appetite is increased, and the body becomes stronger day by day. The condition shows extremely rapid and significant healing phenomena. Those who have stage one or two lung disease should take 'Lung Vitality' and pay attention to recuperation. The result will definitely restore health and there will be no risk of failure. The Life Prediction of Asthma Sufferers Physician Shen Zhaoquan Asthma is called wheezing or phlegm drinking in Chinese medicine. Its symptoms are difficulty breathing, blocked trachea, constricted lungs, unsmooth cough, and suffering that cannot be described in words. The cause of this disease is mostly chronic bronchitis. Patients include the old, the young, and the middle-aged. If it is not cured, it will occur from time to time and bind them for life. Sometimes patients also develop pulmonary tuberculosis due to weakened lungs, and there is a risk to their lives. If elderly people suffer from asthma, the lungs are prone to emphysema, which compresses the heart, leading to heart failure. One careless act can cause the heart to stop working immediately, and life is in danger. Generally, if patients have palpitations, it is a dangerous sign of asthma. Patients must pay attention to it. In the past, there were no good medicines to treat asthma, so patients suffered from it. Although there are asthma medicines sold on the market, most of them contain anesthetic ingredients, which only have a temporary effect and do not cure the root cause. Those who take it every time it occurs often develop addiction, which is especially terrifying for patients. According to the reports of most doctors, there is recently a special medicine for treating asthma called 'Holipin', which can immediately relieve wheezing and strengthen the heart. The author believes that the lungs of asthma patients are generally weak. If 'Lung Vitality' is used at the same time to strengthen the lungs, the effect will be even better, and the effect of eradicating the root cause will be doubled. Spring and Autumn: Please Close Your Mouth Tian The opposite window of the bedroom is a dance hall. Every night after the lights are turned off and I go to sleep, I look at the neon lights shining on the front of the bed, and I often think of the news that neon lights are banned on Ginza Street in Tokyo. I have not been to Japan, so I have not experienced the scenery of Ginza Street, but according to friends, Ginza Street is the busiest street in Tokyo. It is especially flavorful to stroll around there after dinner. However, on such a bustling street, once the neon lights that add to the city's brilliance are banned, its dimness can be imagined. However, for the sake of the "Hundred Years' War", it seems that there is no choice but to conserve and provide disaster relief. Neon lights were banned first, matchsticks were shortened later, and the practice of abolishing leather shoes in office buildings and wearing only wooden clogs, etc., the reaction of "punishment" was indeed a bit flustered. I saw a quick news dispatch from Hong Kong on the 22nd: According to news from Taiwan, the gold and silver utensils taken by the Japanese from the people in Taiwan amounted to more than 5 million Japanese yen in the past year. The items taken, whether wine bottles, teapots, or old coins, were all taken. They even took the gold-inlaid dentures from the people's mouths. This is really an interesting piece of news. We have a saying to describe poverty, called "Even the buttons are without copper" (in the past, copper buttons were used on clothes, such as the "suit buttons" that were popular in Shanghai for a while), but now the disaster has spread to gold-inlaid dentures, and the degree of poverty is self-evident. So, what is worrying is: After those gold-inlaid dentures are knocked off, what other ideas will they come up with? A certain newspaper used "Please Close Your Mouth" as the title of this news report. I think it is quite appropriate to give it to these "shameless" speakers. What, what, everything, everything, just "Please Close Your Mouth". The Scenery of Chinese Medicine Shops Xin Liang A Chinese medicine shop, unless it has over a thousand different medicinal herbs, from inexpensive orange peels to expensive antelope horns, bark, and minerals, is not complete enough to be called comprehensive. According to the lowest estimate, there are four hundred kinds of medicinal flavors in use every day. And according to the doctor's instructions, some medicinal materials must be soaked in honey or human milk first, and some must be boiled with salt or rice wine before they can be used. The Chinese medicine list is indeed like the catalog in a fruit store. For example, watermelon, which is used as a cold drink in summer, occupies an important position in the medicine for treating heat diseases. Other things such as lotus leaves, lotus seeds, olives (especially the dried ones from Tibet), almonds, longan, persimmons, loquats, and pears are also effective medicines for treating coughs. The Chinese medicine list is also like the list in a zoo. Tiger bones can be used as medicine, and when soaked in wine, they can treat rheumatism. Other fathers have tortoise shells, antelope horns, cicada sloughs. Deer antler (priced at 300 yuan per ounce), dead silkworms, rhino horns, scorpions and centipedes, etc. Among them, the last two types are rarely used. Among these types, there are three rare and precious things that are worth mentioning. One is maba. It is said that in the pastures of Mongolia and Manchuria, we can find a peculiar kind of horse. It often breathes deeply under the moon, and does not eat feed for several days in a row. After killing it, we can get a "treasure" that is as hard as a stone in its stomach, which is the best medicine for treating nervous diseases. Also, there are such hard lumps in the bones of cows and dogs - these three medicinal materials can only be bought in a few large pharmacies. Some other Chinese medicinal materials are like things in a grocery store. Among them are mint for treating colds, garlic for treating stomach pains, wine vinegar and salt, etc. The last one is said to be used to treat internal heat. Most Chinese medicinal materials are grass roots, while the rest are mostly stones, minerals, and shells. All kinds of medicinal materials must be purchased from specific places, although many small pharmacies also buy cheap things from other places to sell as genuine products. Medicine shops use tael as the unit. Most medicinal materials are only a few cents per tael, but a common Chinese medicine prescription for two doses always costs around one yuan. The people who work in Chinese medicine shops must undergo long-term training before they can be competent. Arranged against the wall are drawers of medicines, and each drawer contains various medicinal materials. The person dispensing medicine must first know the order in which these drawers are placed. Therefore, without three years of apprenticeship, he cannot know how a thousand different medicinal flavors are placed. Unlike foreign pharmacies where the prescription is taken to the dispensing room, the Chinese medicine shop's dispensing person dispenses various medicinal flavors in front of the customer. He first places the prescription on the counter, and then walks between the counter and the drawers. From each drawer, he takes out various different medicines and puts them on several small square pieces of paper. A common Chinese medicine prescription always has nine to thirteen medicinal flavors, so he has to come and go ten times in this way. When he weighs the last medicinal flavor, a person who checks the medicine runs over to check everything one by one to see if the dispensing person has made any mistakes. After that, he stamps a responsible seal on the prescription, and then the dispenser runs over and uses a soft piece of paper printed with the name and effect of this medicinal flavor to wrap up all the medicinal flavors. An ordinary person really doesn't know how to use a thin piece of paper four inches square to wrap a certain amount of medicine. He will definitely feel that either the paper is too small, or the paper is folded too wrinkly, or even broken. However, the gentleman in the Chinese medicine shop can wrap it very quickly. And it is very neat. Then, the dispenser wraps all kinds of packages together with a large piece of paper, puts the prescription on top, and ties it with a thin rope to complete the job. The price is usually written on the prescription. On weekdays, we can always get a 10% discount, and on the first or fifteenth day of the lunar calendar, we can get an extra 10% discount. Some Chinese medicine shops also give away jujubes or other sweets for free so that patients can relieve the bitterness after tasting the medicine soup. Now, there are also those who decoct the medicine on behalf of customers. They put the decocted medicine soup into two thermos bottles, and only charge five cents per dose. Chinese doctors rarely explain to patients whether the medicine soup should be drunk before or after meals, but most people believe that it is better to take it before meals. The efficacy of the medicine can be easily diluted by food. Translated from the English-language Great American Newspaper A Lady's Affair Bai Hua "Hard to Get" Produced by Warner Bros. Showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater To be honest, many of the "song and dance films" starring Dick Powell have not given me a good impression. His facial expressions and movements when singing are so mechanical. Some people say that Nelson Eddy has no facial expressions when singing, but Dick Powell is even worse. Moreover, perhaps he is too "loyal to art," he doesn't even choose the plays he acts in. "Spring Pastoral," which was shown in Nanjing a month ago, is a good example. Continuing to be so "loyal to art" will lead to decline. In "A Lady's Affair," Dick's change of style is definitely a fact. And with this attempt, he will receive greater success than with "song and dance films," although he is still less dashing compared to those so-called "romantic young men." "A Lady's Affair" is a typical Hollywood romantic comedy. "The girl Margaret drives away and runs out of gas on the way. She goes to a roadside gas station to add gas, but because she doesn't have cash with her, the gas station clerk Bill suspects her of scamming and forces her to sweep the bedroom to pay for it. After being humiliated, the girl decides to design a way to avenge this strange shame." Hollywood screenwriters specialize in writing plays for "playboys" and "young ladies in their boudoirs." This daughter of the wealthy businessman Richards, Margaret, pretends to be her father's maid and pretends to fall in love with Bill, causing Bill to take the blueprint for a national highway construction motel everywhere and run into walls... In the end, it is also a wisp of "affection" that "flies around" Bill and "binds them into a marriage." This story is both bland and absurd. However, Bill's plan for a national highway construction motel is finally achieved due to his indomitable spirit, even serving in a humble position. This "only by enduring the hardships of hardship can you become a superior person" is our best lesson; especially now that we are striving for the "final victory," we should adhere to this spirit. The "profit-only" attitude of capitalists is also thoroughly satirized. The rich man Richards and the banker Edward initially tried to avoid Bill's entanglement, but in the end, regardless of the danger, they went to the forty-second floor to compete with Bill for the contract. Moreover, because it is a comedy, the ugliness of Richards and Edward after their tuxedos are stripped is gratifying. The director Ray E. Enright has rich experience in handling comedies. He not only outlined a humorous and incomparable style for the entire film, but also every scene is full of strong humorous interest. Such as: the mother and daughter's quarrel at the beginning; Margaret's quarrel when forced to sweep Bill's bedroom and the car chain; Bill's rejection when he went to see Richards and Edward; Richards' dinner with Bill, Margaret disguised as a maid, the maid actually occupies the position of the young lady; and the final competition for the contract, all are light, fluent, combined with the liveliness of the lens and the humor of the dialogue, the director of "A Lady's Affair" can be said to be successful. What I especially like is the grasp of Richards' personality. His casualness and impatience, further rendered by many scenes of playing ball, fencing, boxing, wrestling, etc., are truly lifelike. Of course, Charles Winninger's acting skills cannot be ignored. Olivia Havilland doesn't seem to be as pretty as when she plays costume dramas, but the rich and lonely woman Margaret here is very cute. Announcement Buddha Mr. Yao Qixin, greetings: Received your letter of January 15th. This newspaper has changed its delivery address to No. 10 Zhuan An New Village, Yuyuan Road. However, according to the newspaper deliveryman, the new address cannot be found. If I am mistaken, please let me know in a letter. The Primary School Teachers of Shanghai Yi Primary school teachers, generally speaking, are the poorest in the education field. They are busy from morning to night, and what they earn is only enough to make a living. Although Shanghai is a prosperous city, the poverty of primary school teachers is no exception. The qualifications of primary school teachers include the following: (1) Graduates of normal schools, (2) Undergraduates of universities, (3) Graduates of middle schools, (4) Graduates of kindergarten normal schools, (5) Others. The middle school graduates mentioned above include graduates of high schools and junior high schools; kindergarten normal school graduates mostly take kindergarten teachers as their most ideal outlet, and they are all women. The other item includes former Qing scholars and those from general private schools. Although the treatment of primary school teachers varies depending on the situation of the school, generally speaking, in the past, public primary schools were better than private primary schools. Private primary schools vary their teachers' treatment depending on the development of the school and me. In general, the salary is determined by the number of teaching hours. Teachers in the first and second grades usually charge three corners per hour, those in the third and fourth grades charge four corners, and those in the fifth and sixth grades charge five corners. Therefore, the monthly income of a primary school teacher is usually around thirty yuan, and those who can earn forty or fifty yuan per month are very few. In general kindergartens, the monthly salary of female teachers who are usually directors can be about thirty-five yuan; that of assistant teachers is about twenty yuan. This refers to public schools. Private schools are probably less than this number. After the war, primary school teachers in Shanghai, with the exception of a very few, suffered a great blow. Most of their schools were in the war zone or adjacent to the war zone, so they could not start school for a while, and their lives became a problem. A few lucky ones were able to temporarily find a place to stay in schools that were not affected by the shelling, but most of them were unemployed and living a very miserable life. Later, when the environment calmed down a little, some primary schools borrowed one or two temporary classrooms from other schools in the concession to continue teaching, but the treatment of teachers was really miserable. Some primary school teachers only got four or five yuan a month for transportation expenses, which was really miserable, but the school fear was still sighing about the principal! Some primary schools started again from scratch in the concession, but the teachers' salaries were said to have had to be discounted due to the high rent. Those who used to be able to earn thirty or forty yuan can now only get about twenty yuan. Currently, because the population in the concession has increased sharply, the number of school-age children has also increased greatly, so primary school education has been able to develop particularly. There are also primary schools that have moved from the war zone to the concession, and there are also newly established ones. Some that were originally in the concession have even opened branch schools due to the large number of students. However, primary school teachers may not be able to live a slightly more comfortable life because of this. After the Rain, the Sky Clears Bao Tianxiao Chapter 2 Engineer Lin Solves Standardization Sub-Director Jin Talks About Equality He Peiyu said, "Where shall we go to eat?" Lin Jiancheng pointed at Miss Jin and said, "She is a guide, so we will just follow her. Moreover, she is more familiar with this place than anyone else. Of course, she will treat us today. We don't have to be polite, we'll just honestly bother her with a meal." Miss Jin said, "I can still afford this little treat." Sure enough, Jin Danyun led them to a place where the facade was not wide, only a small sign with the four words "Lingcun Restaurant" written on it. Walking in, the inside was extremely spacious. There was also a large hall, and it felt like there were already many people inside. The He sisters peeked over there, and Miss Jin said, "This is not where we eat, please come here with me." He Shuangyu looked up at the pillars of the corridor of the large hall, and there was also a tablet with a line of words written on it: "Cooperative Canteen of the Eighteenth Orphan School". So she asked, "Sister Danyun! Is this another place to eat?" Miss Jin nodded and said, "This is a place set aside in the restaurant for a school student union to eat. It's not good for us to go in." It turned out that since the end of the war, China had set up seventy-two orphan schools, all of which were organized by Chinese families, and even meals and accommodation were provided by the state. This large school was the Eighteenth Orphan School, from elementary school to high school. If they wanted to go to college, the orphan school would send them to various universities. Except for some elementary school students, who ate in the school's dining room and needed someone to take care of them. Middle school students organized a cooperative canteen here, which was managed by the student self-government association, but many teachers also ate here, so they took the name "Cooperative Canteen of the Eighteenth Orphan School". Now, Miss Jin led them to a back porch, which was quieter. Outside the windows of the back porch was a large expanse of green grass, which was also behind the cooperative canteen, an area where students played and strolled after meals. Looking over, beyond the sparse fence was a field of rice paddies. Although it was a back porch, it was very clean. There was also a horizontal plaque on it, with the words "Rice Fragrance" written on it. Below it, there was a couplet copied from two lines of Tang poetry: "Open the window to face the garden, raise the wine to talk about mulberry and hemp." First, Lin Jiancheng looked at it and exclaimed, "Looking at that couplet and this place, it's really perfect. Why haven't I been here before?" Miss Jin smiled and said, "How could you find such a good place? Today, it is also thanks to the two He sisters that I have brought you here." (21)</p>

<p>Free Talk Thorough Faction Wang Yin We have always clung to the philosophy of moderation, but sometimes we are so thorough that it is strange and eccentric. In the past, there was often a phenomenon in the literary world. If someone criticized a certain work as being bad, or said what kind of work should be produced, a hero would immediately jump out and shout, "Why don't you write it?" This is naturally very thorough. A critic should first write a work of his own ideal before he is qualified to criticize others. However, in fact, this is difficult to achieve. As a result, only the critic does not speak, and the work will always get worse or simply cannot be seen to completion, and finally become a thorough cancellation. There is also a phenomenon that if someone points out that a certain old-fashioned article is still "eight-legged essay", a hero will jump out and shout, "Those articles that only use Western allusions are also new eight-legged essays!" This is naturally also very thorough. But if the old is not good and the new is not good either, then what should we do? Except for everyone giving up, there is no other way. But it is not enough</p>
<h3>Arita Still Hopes for Understanding from Various Countries; Yonai Says "New Order in East Asia" Began to Be Established Ten Years Ago</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Navy Minister Yonai guaranteed in the House of Peers today that the Navy is fully prepared for the present and the future, and the entire house burst into applause, changing its usual dull atmosphere, and expressing the same enthusiastic emotions as the House of Representatives. Yonai declared that the establishment of a new order in East Asia did not begin today, but began ten years ago. The Japanese Navy will closely monitor the attitudes of the great powers towards the Sino-Japanese War, and has already drafted a practical plan to safeguard the principles of non-threatening and non-aggression on which the Japanese Navy's policy is based. Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita both answered questions from the questioner. Hiranuma replied that the newly established Asia Development Board will be responsible for handling political, cultural, and economic matters related to China, without interfering in Japan's foreign policy. Foreign policy will still be presided over by Foreign Minister Arita. Arita replied that the new order in East Asia has become Japan's unchangeable policy and must be promoted with all efforts to promote its implementation. Although there are still vast areas in China where foreigners can operate, due to the ongoing military operations and special measures required for strategic reasons, they have not been able to thoroughly investigate their losses, so they have doubts about Japan's actions in China. The government is now trying to seek the understanding of third countries regarding Japan's true intentions, and the way to do so is to restore the situation to normal as soon as possible, in order to show that Japan has no intention of excluding foreigners in the Far East. However, in order to clarify the situation, an early end to the military operations in China is urgently needed. Now, third countries are providing assistance to the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek, which only prolongs the war, and the purpose of clarifying the situation and protecting the rights and interests of all countries cannot be achieved. Baron Sakatani, a business tycoon and member of the House of Peers, asked the Foreign Minister after Arita's speech whether he believed that the ongoing fisheries negotiations in Moscow could be successful, and said that the Soviet government refused to conclude a fisheries agreement with Japan for two reasons: one was that "Manchukuo" did not pay five million yuan for the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the other was that Japan joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. He believed that the real reason for the suspension of this negotiation was not here, but should be sought elsewhere, so he suggested that the government should take fundamental measures to solve this problem, such as exchanging Japan's fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters for fishing rights in Northern Sakhalin.

<h3>British Newspapers Advocate Investing in India to Save Trade with China</h3>
<p>(London) The Financial News published an article stating that a few far-sighted people are now studying the possibility of investing in India in order to compensate for the loss of opportunities in China. As a result of the Far East conflict, India will receive greater attention in terms of both military strategy and economy. The only route for Western trade with China will likely be through Burma. If the West wants to maintain its trade with China, then the possibility of India as a manufacturing and distribution center should be studied. According to his opinion, the changes in Chinese tariffs initiated by Japan will hit all industries, especially the tobacco industry. Therefore, the large amount of tobacco from British and American merchants for the manufacture of cigarettes in China will be seriously affected. Since these merchants have already developed their export trade, moving the manufacture of cigarettes to India can preserve their business. As for the export trade of Chinese eggs and pig bristles, if it has been lost by the West, there is no reason why it cannot be transferred. Western financiers involved in this matter must pay attention to India's natural resources and seek ways to develop them. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese-Russian Fisheries Negotiations Still Deadlocked, But Not to the Point of Breaking Down</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The issue of a fisheries agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union is still deadlocked. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigemitsu Togo has informed Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov that if the negotiations fail, the Soviet government should be held responsible. According to the observations of informed sources, if no unexpected events occur before the start of the fishing season in April this year, the current negotiations will not break down irreparably. The crux of the problem is that the Soviet government plans to hold an auction on March 15 for the operation of the fishing grounds, and insists that the fishing grounds should be allocated by Japanese fishing companies and Soviet fishing agencies, so as to prevent the Japanese side from permanently enjoying the fishing concession rights. Although the Japanese side has not formally refused to participate in the bidding, it has already rejected the principle of allocation and insists on taking the Treaty of Portsmouth as the standard. (This treaty only allows Japan to enjoy fishing rights in the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering Sea, but not in other areas). However, the Soviet government denies that Japan enjoys any priority rights in Soviet territory and territorial waters, and is prepared to fully exercise its sovereignty. The formulation of fishing regulations is one aspect of sovereignty. Moreover, the Soviet side has also accused the Japanese government of being very jealous of the rapid development of the Soviet fishing industry in recent years, and is trying to obstruct it. Several years ago, both Soviet fishing boats and fishermen were lacking, and even Japanese fishermen were hired. Recently, the Soviet Union has built many fishing boats and trained fishermen, so it is naturally unwilling to allow Japan to continue its monopoly. As for the temporary fisheries agreement that expired last year, it was signed by the former Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hirota Koki, and the late Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Karakhan. In this agreement, Soviet fishing rights were greatly restricted. Japan only allowed the Soviet Union to have a certain tonnage of the fish caught each year as an exchange condition. It is now said that Karakhan was shot because the fisheries agreement lost its rights and was regarded as a traitor. The crux of the current fisheries problem between Japan and the Soviet Union is roughly like this. As for the issue of the work contract signed between the Soviet Sakhalin Japanese Commercial Oil Company and the Soviet trade union representatives, the negotiations have not yet been successful.

<h3>Malaria is Prevalent in Various Counties in Southeastern Fujian</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Epidemics are prevalent in Fujian Province. This year, from summer to winter, they have not been slightly curbed. Malignant malaria is the most serious. According to a recent survey, the number of people suffering from malaria in various counties in southeastern Fujian accounts for more than 10% of the total population. For example, in Anxi County, with a population of more than 100,000, more than 16,000 people suffer from malaria. In Dehua, more than 12,000 people suffer from the disease. In Jinjiang, 66,000 people suffer from the disease, and in Putian, more than 56,700 people suffer from the disease. The mortality rate is also very high. The spread is almost alarming. Various counties are working hard to prevent malaria, but because the entire territory of Fujian Province is mountainous, forested, and has heavy miasma and many mosquitoes, it is not easy to achieve results. Therefore, the number of people suffering from malaria in the entire province this year should reach one million. (Telegram, 19th)</p>
