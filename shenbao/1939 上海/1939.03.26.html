<p>社評</p>
<h3>國民精神總動員在上海</h3>
<p>國民精神總動員在上海已經開始推行了，有許多人眞誠熱心地幹着，同時也有許多人當做一種空泛的口號，在那邊有氣無力地談談，更有許多人抱着漠不關心的態度，根本全沒有知道這是什麼一回事。這雖然是每一種運動初起時難免發生的現象；可是這精神總動員實在太關重要了，尤其在上海這孤島上更有迅速普遍推行的必要，所以我們應該大聲疾呼，要求上海市民澈底認識一致努力參加。</p>
<p>就一般常識而論，社會的進化雖有物質基礎的必然性，可是缺乏了人類意志的活動，就不能促使新時代的迅速到來，並達到預期的效果。就中國抗戰形勢而論，孫中山先生說：「武器爲物質，能使用此武器者全賴精神，兩者相較，精神力量居其九，物質力量僅佔其一，」所以精神力量在戰事上有決定的作用；而過去一年半中，全國意志的集中還很不夠，以致日方屢决乘隙而入，作打擊中國人精神與收攬人心的在熱；現當抗戰二期，勝敗興亡所係至鉅，必須及時奮發，施行國民精神總動員，作爲建軍建國克敵致勝的基本。（蔣委員長電文大意）更就上海特殊情形而論，四百萬市民盡是中國國民，然而缺乏普遍的救國組織，缺乏政治的領導，同時對方的宣傳和蠱惑却一天加緊一天，爲堅强抗戰陣綫計，怎樣築成一條上海市民意志的長城，集四百萬市民的個體，化爲整體的抗戰力量，那就更非推行精神總動員不可。</p>
<p>上海市民應認識，國民精神總動員不是公式，不是口號，而是實踐的圭臬。上海市民應認識，國民精神總動員不是抗戰期中的閒文，而是爭取勝利的重要因素。上海市民應認識，國民精神總動員不但在前綫需要着，在後方需要着，而在上海這孤島社會上尤其需要着。</p>
<p>國民精神總動員有綱領，有實施辦法，理論與實踐互相配合，有聯繫性且有整個性；但是上海市民不妨審察客觀的環境和主觀的需要，特別强調着下列各點：</p>
<p>精神總動員的精神改造事項五條，都是針對着中國國民精神缺點和抗戰需要而產生的重要指導原則，其中「醉生夢死之生活必須改正」和「紛歧錯雜之思想必須糾正」兩條，上海市民應該特別注意。自從上海淪爲孤島以後，砲聲一天遠一天，霓虹燈就一天亮一天，歌榭舞塲裏不知消耗了多少抗戰的實力。目前的問題不在上海市民的不知醉生夢死爲不當，却在沒有一種强有力的組織來加以糾正，國民精神總動員是具有組織性的，上海市民今後就應該運用這組織的力量，實行所謂「督促與規勸」的工作，把孤島上的頹廢空氣澈底澄淸一下。再則上海失去了政府統制以後，大多數市民固然懷抱着抗戰必勝建國必成的信念；但是信念不堅或意志動搖的分子，也就托庇洋塲躲在人家所不大注意的角落裏，做着對方散佈精神毒菌的應聲蟲。國民精神總動員可使今後的上海市民，發揮組織的力量，舉行民族意識的堅壁淸野，肅淸一切有毒的思想。</p>
<p>其次，國民公的十二條是中國國民的戰時守則，其中九條是屬於對敵不合作性質的，上海市民應該特別遵行。原來目前上海市民雖然擠在特區裏，但是事實上和江浙淪陷各地都可能而且已有了交通往還，江浙淪陷地域內日偽勢力能吾鞏固，上海市民的抗戰決心，和游擊戰爭同樣地具有很重大的關係。假如上海市民能夠有形無形地完全和日偽絕綠，至少是江浙淪陷地區日偽勢力的致命打擊。因此上海市民爲了表示愛國的決心起見，應該積極地努力遵守國民公的，澈底推行對日偽的不合作運動。</p>
<p>復次，孤島四百萬市民缺乏普遍的救國組織。精神總動員就是一種最有效的補救辦法。如果在各團體。各學校。各家庭，各工商服務機關裏，都普遍發展了精神總動員的組織。那末，不但如上述的生活糾正和思想糾正，可以通過了組織的形式而遂行，就是一切的救國工作。也都可以因組織的力量而廣泛地展開了。</p>
<h3>反共約擴為聯盟　日內部意見衝突　有引起政潮之可能　侵華戰事一籌莫展　有田外交徘徊歧路</h3>
<p>（東京）據今日此間消息、關於德國建議擴大反共公的爲德義日軍事同盟、以與民主陣綫對壘之問題、現已在此間政界引起劇烈之爭執、或將演成內閣之政潮、亦未可知、日本首相陸相海相藏相在本星期中對於此一問題、會作數度之商討、大的不日卽能决定日本之政策、日本議會定於今日閉幕　預料此事能加速日本政府之决策、蓋免去議會之質問後、政府可以自由推行其認爲滿意之計劃也、</p>
<p>目前日本內閣中之多數閣員、似皆反對捲入歐洲政治漩渦之行動、但同時彼等在不能獲得其他方更好之條件者、亦不願拋棄與德聯盟之可能性、此處可注意者、卽向來態度保守之「東京日日新聞」、昨日亦破天荒第一决著論、主張與德義成立「較堅强之協定」、目前成爲日本不便立卽與全能國家締結軍事同盟成一反民主國聯合陣綫之原因、卽因在「中國之重建」上、日本非有民主國之接濟援助不可、</p>
<p>據傳日本外相有田對於此一問題、曾有對案提出、卽德義日之軍事同盟、僅能適用於對蘇聯之作戰上、但該項對案、此間有數政界方面、認爲德義兩國不致接受、聞日本駐德大使大島、對於此一問題、已與德方有所成議、故日本假若拒絕德方之建議、則大島或將出於辭職之一途、甚至有田外相與平沼首相或皆將辭職、亦未可知、日本參謀本部之穌聯義德各司、亦皆主張與德義成立闊大之聯盟、惟陸相板垣似乎僅主張在反蘇聯之立塲上、運用此種同盟、日本海軍部則反對與德義締結闊大之盟的、蓋根據德方之建議、假若歐洲發生戰爭時、日本之海軍必須開往歐洲、且並無損害賠償之保障、又德義文化協定、本星期雖已簽字、對日本政府對於柏林羅馬軸心、顯然表示冷淡、因日本深知德國所要求之收獲、實在其所願提供之酬報之上也、在目前談判中之日德商的中、德方不獨不允採取物物交換制、且主張現金支付制、故談判前途並不順利、</p>
<p>又聞日外相以爲、若欲解除日本目前之困難、最好與英美合作、雖目前尚無此種可能性可見、有田之意、以爲第三國（大的指英美等等）假若能提供切實之報酬、則日本可以開放揚子江、以供第三國商船之進出、靑島之開放、此間認爲卽爲日本轉向、允其轉向英國之一種表示、據熟悉政情者言、假若美國在經濟上幫助日本完成開發華北之計劃、則日本卽將拋棄與德義聯盟之建議、（二十五日美聯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）關於中日兩國戰事形勢、共和派「紐的民聲講壇報」頃加以評論、標題爲「日本殆巳失敗」、首謂日木欲以武力征服中國之政策、業已失敗、其與國德義兩國、亦必因是感覺苦悶、且局勢所示、德義日三國已不能將反共產國際公的、改爲軍事同盟條的、「關於此事、日本外相有田會徵求該國兀老西園寺公爵之意見、並經閣議討論之後、卒予以吾決、蓋日本擬與德義兩國締結同盟條的之一派、併海陸軍部人員在內、（若輩原皆切望能與各與國樹立更密切的關係）曾將其主張奏聞天皇、而天皇則照例諮詢元老、顧乃不能如願以償、特此决主張雖已失敗、究未可認爲該國當局對於德義兩國在歐洲所抱目標、不復表示同情、僅乃日本在此世界鬥爭中、須俟確有把握之後、始乃與德義締盟而作孤注之一擲耳、至德國元首希特勒與義國元首墨索里尼能吾取獲勝利、原屬並無把握之事、則日本之不欲遽與德義站於失敗之方面、是在情理之中、惟該國海陸軍當局尚未便公然作如是觀、庶幾維持其色厲內荏之弱點、」云（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本圖拉攏德國　交還靑島為餌　並將加羅林代管島歸德　此舉於軍略上意義重大</h3>
<p>（柏林）非官塲之政界現討論日本將靑島交還德國之可能性、靑島於一八九七年十一月十四日因德敎士兩入被害、爲德國所佔領、歐戰時日本奪靑島於德人之手、復於一九二二年交還中國、今又復入日人掌握中、故現有靑島或可給還德國之說、惟衆信現有一種困難、爲德國復取靑島之阻力者、卽此舉與審慎保持之中德友誼不相適應是也、（廿四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）「新聞記事報」探悉、日政府已向德國提議、願以太平洋中加羅林羣島給還德國、以此爲日本對德好意之姿勢、且爲他國據有德國前殖民地者之表率、聞此提議附有俟德國從英法收回其前殖民地後、加羅林羣島須卽交還日本之條件、按加羅林羣島共有島嶼五百、介於菲列濱羣島與馬夏爾羣島之間、陸地面積的三百八十方哩、居民的四萬、最初發現此島者爲葡萄牙人、時爲一五三七年、後由德國於一八九九年以葡幣二千五百萬披斯多購得之、一九一九年由國聯委託日本代管、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）工黨「每日民聲報」頃載稱、柏林方面昨傳日本擬將中國膠州灣讓給德國、「其地雖屬商務上之良好根據地、但日本若果以之轉讓德國、則軍略意義必較經濟意義允爲重大、」自由黨「新聞紀事報」則謂、日本政府聞曾向德國提議、願將太平洋中加羅林羣島（現由日本代管）歸還德國、藉以表示良善意志、而爲他國交還舊日殖民地之表率、「但附以一項奇特條件、卽德國若自英法各國收回舊有殖民地、仍應將加羅林羣島歸還日本」云、（廿五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）英國通訊謂德國希望日本歸還靑島、此間人土聞之殊爲驚異、想係造謠生事者欲激動反德之情緒、故爲中傷之詞、德國方面據負責者稱、並未與日本論及關於靑島之事故、甚至德國當局未作此想云、（二十五日海通電）</p>

<h3>日內外情勢煎迫益亟　平沼內閣前途黯淡</h3>
<p>戰費預算已感羅掘俱窮</p>
<p>一般情緒急欲結束戰事</p>
<p>推測平沼內閣的前途，應自認識平沼內閣的性能始。對於平沼內閣的認識，照例可以從主觀力量與客觀的情勢兩方面來分析，同時還可以就平沼內閣與近衛內閣二者的陣容作個比較的觀察，雖說平沼內閣只是近衛內閣的延長，或謂二者爲同一物。</p>
<p>平沼內閣的主觀力量</p>
<p>在主觀力量方面，日本議員河野巳下過概括的斷言：「平沼內閣爲日本有史以來最不孚人望的內閣。」我們若申論這句話，那末，第一，平沼騏一郎之爲人，平時即被負推薦內閣總理大臣的責任者，且其意議形態多少影響日本政治動向的元老重臣所懷疑；第二，即財界的上層也以平沼平時大唱「革新」的高調而視爲危險人物；第三，陸海軍省對於平沼還是談不到堅決的信任與熱誠的擁護，所以當他上臺的時候，還提出七項條件；第四，政黨對於平沼內閣之反感已十分表現於本屆議會的質間上，更是無須詳述的了。平沼首相本身的條件這樣，他的閣僚的條件更是低拙。當前在日本內閣中佔最重要地位的閣僚，除海陸軍省兩位大臣外，即是內務，外交，和財政了，平沼內閣的內相木戶，雖說是近衛內閣的舊關係，但其處事魄力與背景力量皆不如末决多多。當他上臺唱開塲白時，即便宣明放棄從來所活動的新黨運動，即國民再組織遝動。他的最大作用，只在於替平沼緩和元老重臣的憎惡罷了。若藏相石渡比之池田，直是小巫見大巫，他不但不能代表財界的意志，即應付財界的手腕都很拙劣，他的財政政策，居然又要踏襲賀屋的覆轍，池田所不採用的增稅方針，賀屋竟要大大地採用，對於日本人民特別是農村的重負，緊閉着眼睛裝瞎子，我們實在不知道這位「財政藝衛家」如何能不跌交。說到外相的有田，人物固然如舊，但更加惡化的環境，却使同一個人頭腦更加糊塗起來，此外，新入閣的農相櫻內韋雄，鐵相前田米藏，及厚生相廣瀨，更是無足輕重的。櫻內（民政黨）和前田（政友會）只是政黨閣僚的點綴，日本議會政治的名自存在一日，日本閣僚當中總不能不安挿一兩個政黨黨員，其僅爲伴食的地位，早爲民政黨總裁町田所鄙棄，其不能於內閣與政黨之間發生任何作用，也可以想見了。至於厚生相的廣瀨呢，他不過是內相木戶的旁枝，最初平沼祖閣本即決定木戶兼仟內相與厚生相。但是木戶在電話上的回答是：「兼任的擔負過大，實受不了，請以决官的廣瀨充厚生相。」廣瀨的作用也可想見，其他的閣僚全部是近衛的「舊人舊位一，自無贅述的必要。</p>
<p>平沼內閣的客觀悄勢</p>
<p>自其呱呱墮地之日，耶便帶上第三期肺癆病的平沼內閣，最大的難題，還是在客觀情勢的惡劣上頭。雖然一般日本人平時即不以平凡視平沼，大多認平沼爲「對日本帝國的興隆，覺有於政治，經濟乃至敎育諸制度施以大刷新必要的革新政治家，」（見今日的問題）所以還有不少人期待着平沼內閣之實現，但是今日的環境已大非昔比，平沼平時的抱負，能吾在這時候貫澈，實是絕大的疑問。論「革新政治一思想的抱負，近衛的熱情當較平沼濃厚，近衛平時即常以華族的身份而高唱其「革新論，」前年七　後，還不忘情於衆議院選舉法的改正，貴族院制度的改革，至普遍的文官制度的修改，但是結果呢，萬事依舊，即新黨運動，或國民再組織的運動，也只成了空喊罷了。近衛雖費盡甚大的精力支持難局一年又半，但其結果則只獲得了「優柔院」，「相尅磨擦回避居士」（來閒之言）的封號。論近衛的聰明實較平沼爲高，他在總辭職前曾經作過一度最大努力的試探工作，他看淸日本國內外的情勢及內閣內部的矛盾，不容易克服，所以不顧兀老重臣以次各方面的慰留，而斷然出以總辭職之舉，只答應擔任不管部大臣的閒職。平沼在倉卒間擔當起內外情勢日益惡劣的大局，平沼幾乎可說全盤繼承了近衛內閣閣僚的滓渣及更加深化的危機，縱有三頭六臂也難於挽回頹勢，何况平沼也是極平庸的一個。目前陳列在日本最嚴重而又最難解決的問題，就是如何趕快結束中日戰爭，日本對華侵略戰爭巳將近二十個月，只軍隊的傷亡即達七十多萬，軍隊的動員已達後備軍及預備軍，兵種間題竟然上了日本議會的日程，物質與財力的消耗更爲鉅大，日本財政的來源刻己羅掘俱盡，本年度預算案特別難產，在平時頭一年七月即大體編成，二月問即需最後決定，本年度却一直拖延到現在，還未及全盤決定。其最大的原因，在於此後戰費即所謂軍事特別預算之難於決定。據最近消息，日本木年度海陸軍臨時追加預算（此項或即爲軍事特別預算）的動目，共達五十九億七十萬日圓。較之去年度的陸海軍臨時追加預算案總額四十八億五千萬日圓，多出十一億二千萬日圓。此項數目，原已不少，但是此後軍事行動的擴大，將使實際用途大於此數多多，而此項預算的來源，又須依靠公價（五十二億九千萬日圓）及增稅（納六億八千萬日圓），都是不可知的前途。日本或可以攫奪中國江海關稅收，並利用黑毒及其他卑鄙的稅源，來補償至某種程度，但其全部破局則仍爲不遠。七月問還需準備編制下年度預算案，不知平沼老頭子將如何應付呢？</p>
<p>運用政策已日暮途窮</p>
<p>日本對華的政策已經紊亂了，並且達到了不能不紊亂的階段。正如政友會議員世耕弘一在本屆議會的指責，日本「對華不動方針」却在不斷變動着，最近外訊傳來消息，竟稱：「日本政府現已採取一完全意外的步驟，向中國媾和，日本曾向華方建議，組織一以蔣委員長任要職之新政府。……」這當然是日本的欺騙和引誘，但其對華方針的動搖則可斷言。日本利用政治進攻，幾乎可以說完全失敗了，剽竊三民主義，利用文化侵略的問題，竟也上了日本議會的日程。其政策之日暮途窮，已經完全暴露，也就是平沼內閣的致命傷。日本政府當前的第二大難題，是與侵華戰爭密切關聯着的「親和外交」的問題。素以「超等人種」自負（前日本間諜意大利人樊司派之言）的日本侵略者，雖然夢想着征服中國，亞洲，乃至全世界，但因格於環境，事實上還需調和其與各國的外交關係。這個責任最初放在廣田肩上，結果則愈協調愈不調和，繼其後的字垣也終於一塗敗地，倉惶出走了。有田在近衛內閣即暴露了外交的無能，目前的處境又困難十百倍，英美法共同制裁的方法，雖未見得全般發動，但是最近熊度的强硬和種種措置也已够有田外相頭痛了。再加以三四月間蘇日漁的糾紛的開展，將使有日比宇垣還要束手無策，日軍閱旣無實力和決心與蘇聯作戰，結果還須對蘇屈服，但是責任上却須政府負其咎。</p>
<p>急欲結束其對華戰事</p>
<p>日本軍部最近在議會上的答覆，已很顯明地表露出對蘇無力的馬脚，柏林德意日軍事外交聯席會議上，德意又要求日本同時向英美法進攻，海軍派爲着事功强調着對華「膚懲」到底，堅持海軍設備的强化。於是悍然佔領了日本在太平洋上兩隻鐵拳之一的海南島，造成了「太平洋的九一八事變一，破壞了英美法日太平洋的均勢。此後日本與英美法的外交關係將更如何糾紛，是可以想見的。日本因爲國際關係的惡劣，及對華戰爭無法結束，引起的內政糾紛，因而內部各種的矛盾，也是平沼內閣目前的大危機。「日本有史以來最不孚人望」的平沼內閣，對於這些矛盾，確已瞠目不知所措。平時懷抱大大改革日本政治經濟至敎育等制度的平沼，到了此　也　聲言，平沼內閣將以近衛內閣的方針爲方針。但是近衛內閣正如日木評論家的評言，是「優柔院」，而近衛是「相尅磨搽的週避居士」，那末，平沼對內政策之動向，巳完全可知了。現在即已對國民再組織的新黨運動問題不敢提及，此後成爲懸案已久的選舉制度改革問題，貴族院制度改正問題，乃至文官制改革問題，將不敢問津了。道樣一來，平沼主觀上所熱望的，日本政治更法西斯化的前途，也都無法推進一步，平沼內閣將更顯得脆弱。至於其他物質總動員問題精神總動員問題，乃至厚生省所管轄的各種問題，都是處處與侵華戰爭聯着密切關係，日前更是無法圓滿解決的。現在對於更擴大的戰爭，巳經不只是元老重臣持穩　態度，即上層財界也都主張不擴大主義了，即軍人中問也有主張「適可而止」的人了。平沼此後的處境實在十分困難：隨少壯派軍人狼奔豕突嗎，日本的國力委實不允許，軍閥以外的大多數日本人也都米必贊成，實行其所謂「和親政策」嗎，內外情勢又不能讓他圓滑施展其手腕，何况根本就沒有手腕可言，這樣弱體內閣，「掛形」內閣，在不久的將來，不改造，總須總辭職。無怪乎河野要求平沼：「從速改組內閣網羅新人物」，而平沼也只能以苦笑相答而已</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況沉寂而呆、毫無精彩、交易亦平庸無色、價格因處於證券帮及命號吸購下、頗形穩定、終日盤旋於二千〇八十万元及八十二元之間、結果續漲三元五角，各方人心平定、交易不旺、上下午共約三百五十兩、銀樓飾金依然未更、海關金暨中英純金等亦仍呆定、</p>
<h3>焙赤暗盤沉寂</h3>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因聞外匯　勢略軟、故賣者頗稀、致久未做開，直至十時〇五分、首見錢兌業進現金號五十兩、二千〇八十五元為開盤價、較上日做高三元五角、聞後證券帮進金號五十兩、為八十四元、繼之錢兌業相同價亦互做五十兩、此後供求轉稀、價亦鮮少變幻、迨至十一時光景、因外滙為狀轉平、故賣方供意稍濃、而進者其時均袖手旁觀、故價略趨疲、銀樓帮賞予錢兌業五十兩、八十二元、時已十一時二十分、此後大眾會員因無供求頭寸、故散場頗早、致午收慣仍為八十二元、午後初開依然沉寂、迨至二時半許、某金號忽與買風價遂重復趨堅，首進錢兌業五十兩，八十二元、繼之進現金唬五十兩、八十三元、後又進錢兌業五十兩、八十五元、此後仍想吸購、奈售者須八十七元、方肯供給、致難做開、故晚收價作二千〇八十五元、結果較前收軋漲三元五角、全天僅三元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇九十五元、收進二干〇八十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做昂、</p>
<h3>烚赤更無變幻</h3>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出因烚赤益鮮變幻、故亦仍未更動、大同行老慶雲等仍懸二百十一元、新同行為二百〇九元、收進二百〇三元、</p>
<h3>純金屹立不動</h3>
<p>二十四日倫敦電、英純金依然呆定於七鎊八先令五辦士、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價</p>
<h3>銀行供給不暢　英美滙市續緊</h3>
<p>滙市昨以各大洋行結款頻繁、兼銀行給不爽、致潛勢繼續略緊、唯中途雖華商突來抛塞美金票，而外行吃胄頗佳、故未蒙影響、半天交易不多、港匯因雙方供求勢均、致為狀極鮮變幻、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期勿動、遠期回長〇六二五、紐約銀價依然呆定、倫敦生金仍平、滙兌英對美小一厘六、對法對滬均平、美對英縮一二五、對法降〇六二五、對滬跌五分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開寶價、英匯八辦士二六五六二五、美滙十六元一二五、較之前收、英美兩滙均無榮辱，開後洋行界結款殷繁、故狀略軟、洋行首先結進華僑荷蘭．某行美滙十六元〇九三七五、兼又購結匯豐華此．某行英滙八辦士二五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無上落、仍微百分之五.〇〇、此後華商投機家突、來拋塞美金票、但以外行吃冑頗佳、故未蒙影響、華商賣予大通.某行美金票十六元一八七五、将近午時、洋行又吸進廣東港滙五十五元三七五、迨午收亦站定於一千二百十一元六角、褂牌海關金亦仍末更、計二元三角九分四厘、上海標準標金價亦仍舊一千二百〇六元九角云、</p>
<h3>英美金票上升</h3>
<p>昨日英純金未動、英美匯兌回降一二五、本埠外滙、洋行解結款甚殷、銀行因歐洲局势鬆弛、賣意未旺、供給不暢、市價微軟，週六下午無市、烚赤開盤堅挺、散戶時起吸納、惟無大戶收買、金號錢兌業等逢高拋塞、變動甚微、下午交易稀少、勢呈盤旋带堅，外幣英美金鎊、需要未殷、英美金　、殷富頗多出籠、外銀行及錢兌業吸納甚暢、市價隨匯票軟弱、多趨堅挺、義大利票德金票需要甚稀、多無意收納，略形下降、公匯交易未做開、昨日市價，英金票升八分、美金票升一分穴厘，香港票升四厘、法郎票升半匣、坎拿大票升二分、義大利票降半分、德金票降一角、其他各幣、俱無更動銀行賣價、英匯八辦士二五、美匯十六元〇九三七五、結果較之前收、英緊〇一五六二五、美軟〇三一二五、港匯則未分軒輊、午後週六無市，茲將半天做開交易錄後、</p>

<h3>貼現屹然不動</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率呆定逾恒、每千元貼率、始終為五十元〇二角半、與前日價相同、</p>
<h3>大條近平遠長　印銀現貨略漲</h3>
<p>二十四日倫敦電、銀市印度買進遠期、美商及大陸少數賣出、市面平、收盤後、近遠期照掛牌價均有成交、但市面仍頗平穩、大條銀近期勿動、遠朋則回長〇六二五、</p>
<p>又紐約電美銀現貨依舊呆定</p>
<p>又孟買電、印銀市況轉平、現貨回長一安那、近遠期則未更動、</p>
<h3>京杭各地中行　票據向滬行交換</h3>
<p>本市銀行業聯合準備委員會昨日通函各行云『准上海中國銀行函稱、敝行南京分行暨所屬蘇州.無錫．鎮江．揚州．蚌埠．新浦．常熟．各支行、又杭州分行暨所屬嘉興．湖州兩支行及盛澤．硖石兩辦事處共十三行處、均已先後遷滬辦理收付茲為便捷起見、此後上列香行處之付款票據、擬請貴匯一律予以交換」等語．茲規定此後各交換銀行收入中國銀行南京．蘇州．無錫鎮江．揚州.蚌埠．新浦。常熟．杭州．嘉興.湖州．盛澤．硖石各分支行處之付款票據、均得向該行滬行提出交換、』云云、（Y）</p>
<h3>證券　多頭慣會造謠　公債漲風一現即逝</h3>
<p>政府如果要收買公債</p>
<p>是否將發出大宗鈔票</p>
<p>證券暗曉、昨日市況、因歐局風雲似告一段落、本報早先所載領鈔新規定、亦已證實、適因市場浮多在此數日疲軟時、大多數均已斬割了結、環境稍行優良、即起反動、此固在本報预料中、惟以適逢週六、一則以即日浮多出脫、一以星期休假關係、多方進冑不甚踴躍、市場驟漲即定、下週當尚有變動也、昨日經過、午前初開即漲起半元、天生聯和恒孚以及散戶均有吸收、同康仍係賣出、同順順亨及倌豐永均有吐山、三十八號亦暗有出脱、但市價因散戶吸收甚力、午前即好起五七角、午後散戶仍有進冑、貿大及水豐進冑亦健、市價續見微高、旋以一般浮多出手、同康及三十五號均有賣出、趨勢略受挫折、結果一致回高四角半至六角、午後無成交、總數約六十萬元左右、至云某處收買之說、未琵滑稽、政府正在發行公債、何至吸收、如果收進公債、勢必流出钞票、結果必致通貨籌碼增加、想不至出此下策、故明係多頭利用報紙、散布流言、以欺愚昧耳、茲列简明表於</p>

<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月二十四日（星期五）掛牌行市、以歐局稍見和緩、市無微好、匯豐銀行股回升半鎊、價各為八十四鎊、開平煤礦股回升六辨士、價為十七先令三辨士、古拉客林傍橡皮股回升七辨士半、價格仍為十八先令九辨士、餘無變動、倫敦中國外幣債券、本月二十四日（星期五）掛牌行市、英金書後公債英發債票猛跌二鎊牛，價為四十九鎊半、其餘均無變動、本日供求、亦告兩寂、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋粉湧到聲中　本粉售盤復鬆　廠方備袋装麥</h3>
<p>粉現貨市况、又告鬆疲、查本客去化因值週未、新交易殊不興奮、蓋北洋帮日特價開出一批後、尚五整批交易之聯蟬、南洋帮亦以講價未成、暫無整額妥交、更兼市傅花旗洋粉新到一船、如金馬雙鷹等牌均係檩準二號洋粉、在市兜售甚股、聞現貨祇售四元三角至二角八分、而一部分客帮、亦轉移於洋粉、昨聞北洋帮秦皇島等處已有數千包成交、本粉市面、無形中大受打擊、故二號粉廠盤已由四元六角回至五角五分之說、如有大帮去化、则四元五角之特價尚可接談、惟表面上仍未切實公佈、或將待諸週初矣、查麵粉出口、今有六萬六千五百包、運往天津、又一萬一千包，運往汕頭、</p>
<p>麥市亦轉定暗鬆之象、因近日洋粉傾銷聲中、本粉市價迭見回小、原料市面不無運帶關係、惟目下本麥到存兩枯之際、街無專大影響、昨聞福新阜豐兩廠採辦蔴袋二十一萬、以備裝麥之用．據說散艙洋麥不久可到、一說預備新麥登場時應用、至本麥交易、又在停頓中、</p>
<h3>粳秈行市績小　洋米跌價動銷</h3>
<p>粳米來源、河下共到七號、車來包子一二千包、本街及囤戶銷場，初則尚有動辫、惟後終以限價嚴厲、人心轉虛弱頓見呆木、各貨大都未能做開、市面即難立足、呈下垂之色、結果、若厚薄粳價回落一二角、杜洋尖埠尖相隨跟低角許，鑾元價格既高、而陰元來源漸夥、銷路轉滯、價降三角、陰元則略貶一角、　　　　客秈販續脫、本街消化甚懈、市面續小一二角、高無秈街有十二元七角之價、而中次自十二元四五角至十二元不等、惟價跌後本街零戶與南帮均有赂辦後市已得平定、統市交易仍不足三千包、</p>
<p>號西貢，連日堅持於上七元以上、惟交易貝减、困本客各秈售價步落，例如南京蕪蕪湖秈已自十三元半以上之最高價、步降至十二元七八角、而洋米跌度甚微、致為進戶所觀望、昨行價曾有十六元八角連費之價甩出、零化稍見活絡、至於工部局之缺斤原包、亦有二千包批出云、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗銷不太景氣　現貨與棧單軋攏　價格相差祗一元</h3>
<p>紗市繼續下挫、跌風未戰、蓋以一般進手之貨、鑒於環境不良、且金融界囤積之貨、亦圖脫銷、於是人氣愈形怠懈，同時客帮實需依然呆滯而無動辦生色、由此市熊更見散漫無勁、二十支雙馬紗開盤價為三百八十一冗、繼以人心恐虚、瀉進八十元關口、低價為三百七十七元、不過近兩日來、已狂落十餘元、浙東仍安謐、温台客帮紗綫照常裝運、前途究屬若何、須恃實需之多寡為轉移也、午後形勢稍定、但生意依然蕭條、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、同業相聚大家觀望而無生氣、等待至十時一刻外、才有行市微開、二十支雙馬棧單開價為三百八十元、係同行進七十五包、旋以客帮生意始終無活絡氣象、加之賣戶業集於市、叫價日趨下沉，現貨初由三百八十一元、最低價做至三百七十七元，此開盤價要跌四元、惟棧單價稍昂、做到三百七十六兀、僅差一元，蓋以現貨銷路缺乏、且廣方催出、如不　東、非照市賣出不可、棧單尚有時期可緩也、午後開盤平平、伹市場交易尤稀、查全日各帮賣去統計一千一百二十五包，行情二十文隻、紗價比上日　四五、天女跌三元半、特金城跌四元、廠方由安達廠開出十支飛虎一百五十包、價為二百九十元、今日有紗五百十件運汕頭，一百件運香港、一百九十件運廣州灣、八百六一五件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　　　　五二五　溫州　四〇</p>
<p>福建　　　　八〇　　汕頭　一四〇</p>
<p>內地　　　　一六〇　雲南　一七五</p>
<p>泉州　　　　　五　　　統計　　　一、一二五</p>
<p>日紗市面仍無生氣、實銷仍清、惟下月份情况較昂、因大戶頭俱在多頭地位也、二十支水月現紗價為三百三十九元、二十支藍鳳現紗慣為三百三十元之譜、與上日不相上下</p>
<p>美棉每週統計</p>
<p>紐約電、去年八月一日起至今年三月二十四日止、美棉統計列左、（單位包每包四百磅）</p>

<h3>匯山碼頭倉庫大火　印棉被焚三千件</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市殊感疲乏、南方在市套費頗烈、美農部之棉業委員會、將於下週舉行會議、討論施密斯之提案及貸款棉出口津貼諸問題各同業均抱觀望態度、靜待華盛頓之解決、以為美棉價格漲落之依歸、昨日紐約跌四磅音、印度跌一羅比、埃及回好八磅音、昨日匯兌路緊、折合法幣、計美棉及巴西棉每組跌三角、印棉跌，角、埃及漲二角、</p>
<p>滬市外棉交易、因紗價之連跌、各廠均無意採辦原棉、因之外棉交易異常冷落、惟申新廠前數日會開雙馬二千包、昨日補進二十支原棉印棉白洛區二千件、鴻章進白洛區三百包、餘廠均無交易、日廠未開採購已有多日、前日進口之Toyama　Maru由印運來印棉二萬六千餘包、前日将棉起卸於滙山碼頭第二三倉庫、前晚二號倉庫大火全部焚去、内共印棉三千件、內計東棉洋行一千五百件、福家洋行一千件、其他者五百作、茲將昨日外棉價列後、</p>

<p>本棉生意轉寂、蓋以紗銷方無心購辦原料、故各方成交驟形零落　市價帶屁、但存底既薄、加之來源凋敝、市價擯持仍不動、與上日無甚軒輊、蘇北一路來源　計通州花四百三十二包、茲將現棉情形列下、</p>
<p>一、〇〇〇包　　　匯劃送廠</p>

<p>一〇〇包　　　　現鈔棧交</p>
<h3>雜糧　洋莊生忍　青島產價受限制</h3>
<p>十二元八角......許跌不許漲</p>
<p>青島通訊、該處生仁以上漲不已、為洋莊所注意，故由「取引所」予以限制，議决以十二元八角為最高價、不得再升、且規定每週須貶價二角、如有加價私收、經查出、必予嚴煞云云、如是則現在之局面、是只許跌而不准漲矣、故趨勢頓呆、洋莊仁以十二元八角由洋莊及油坊辦去三千包、大粒仁小二角、以十三元六角成文一千四百包，申市存薄較俏，青島洋莊仁開過十五元半、威海統生十四元八角、</p>
<p>花生　產市亦略挫、王台生小二角、開十元，高密生小一角、開十元半、共成交二千二百包、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市平靜</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、漸　穩定、紐約市場、現貨價均未勤、交易所近遠期各漲半分、横濱現貨未有上下，近遠期升三四元、里昂各絲價亦無變化、</p>
<p>滬埠市氣、依然呆頓、各西商均未时發絲電、如下週外絲價上昂、或有開展之望、昨祇法莊進辑里經中身十担、開一〇一五元，印度莊口尚觀望、</p>
<h3>疋頭　綸昌麻紗　本街逐日分派一空</h3>
<p>東疋直接運銷游擊區</p>
<p>國布白貨、市價續疲、蓋以華紗猛跌、浙贛幫實銷受軍事影響、驟告清淡、而滬甬匯兌、近又突高至一千〇六十二元、兩方款子滙來、尤增困難、惟華紗雖跌、日紗仍屹立不、布疋成本未减、日布售價均堅、政團布跌勢亦屬緩和、每疋續落五分之譜、實銷以本街及粤帮為最生色、本街門市批發號逐日向本市各廠派取大批定貨、而府綢印花貨並各種坯布新額、亦源源買進、綸昌印花勿退色花布麻紗逐日出貨、俱為本街各大布號分派一空，本街染坯．細斜續有成交二百餘包、閩帮為鄭重辦理國布登記事、暂又禁上國布入口、惟怡和．綸昌廠各布係英商出品、仍准裝往、</p>
<p>東布市氣堅昂、細斜因染銷日盛、現貨告缺、續趨上騰、龍頭斜紋每疋又提漲一角外、江商洋行開出下月份期貨龍頭細斜十二元〇五分、五福細斜十一元九角、但件額不多、祗一百餘包、本街及青島帮採辦細布．細斜約八百餘件、目下同業手貨存楨殊薄，而日商行盤扳緊、且聞有直接運銷於游擊區、故滬市貨底漸少、人心益堅、</p>
<p>出口、近日四百三十件運天津、六十件運烟台、六百七十件運汕頭、一百十件運香港、四百五十元件運廣州灣、三百四十件運海防、</p>
<h3>南北貨　杏仁漲風大熾　暴騰四五十元</h3>
<p>杏仁因匯水難劃、又為某方限制出口、漲風大熾、昨市行盤白玉扁升五十元、為二百五十元、龍王扁升三四十元、售二百元、　杏亦叫同價．查統市存底僅數十包而巳、</p>
<h3>五金　新鉛絲存貨奇少</h3>
<p>新鉛絲銷路、向以天津帮為最暢、因近日能裝運出口、故都下手動辦、查昨日開出達數百担有奇，聞行情因存貨薄弱、且來貨缺乏、故異常俏俐、如二十二號至二十五號售二十六元、單吊二十五號可售三十元光景、组花色開二十三元．中檔貨則售二十二元、均較前好起一元及數角不等、</p>
<h3>糖市　石門片青獨穩　路貨開出四百件</h3>
<p>昨糖市仍呈平軟、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白轉口貨下月份交貨價十六元五角、成交一百包、現貨及太古糖叫原價無成交、國糖交易尚活、綿白開出三百餘包、價如高貨為二十三元五角、次至二十三元至二十二元八角、提莊青數十包、價十五元五角、片青市情獨穩，石門片青路貨開出四百件、二星期交貨、價為規鈔十元〇六角、</p>
<h3>油餅　宛如交易所市場景象　豆油變幻多端</h3>
<p>豆油市况、晨初因連市平定、现貨　碼有增無减、致各方人心优惚、市级中賣氣較强，四月份期油會有三十二元回籠貸兜售、但乏受主、故未成交、不久連電報升、市場即見求多供少、價遂反動上升、漲跃倏忽、宛然如交易所市場景象、結果一致軋升一二角、計妥開烟岐油五十件（價詳市價　）連岐油九十件、六　八十件、現大連油一百餘桶、四月份交五百桶、五月份交二百桶、</p>
<p>生油來源絡繹有到、交易略見活動、做開烟豪油四百件、價為二十八元六角、膠州油一百五十件、二十九元原盤、四月份嘐州油跌二角、成交一百二十件、二十八元、刻下生油潛勢、因有時令關係、銷場恐少興奮、故一般投機操縱家、或可稍稍　跡云、</p>

<h3>鳳陽丸赴漢途中　被華軍炸沉</h3>
<p>「船中滿載糧秣</p>
<p>損失百餘萬元」</p>
<p>現代社云、據外商航業界傳出消息、日商日清公司長江班輪鳳陽丸、載重一千餘噸、載後為日軍當道征用、改充運輸艦、裝運軍火食糧之用，該輪於本月十二日赴漢途中、在南京與九江間之江面上、被華方飛機炸沉、與鳳陽丸同行者、尚有大吉丸運輸艦一艘在前、鳳暘丸在後、中間有一軍艦保護、三艦相距數十里、忽來華機兩架、其一盤旋軍艦上空威脅、該艦高射砲機關槍對準該機交鬥、另一機乃乘隙向距離甚遠之鳳陽丸投彈轟炸二彈中其頭部、將前半部炸毁、全身頓時進水、迅速沉沒、輪上人員、並無一人獲救、而大吉丸則疾駛赴漢脫險、日軍艦亦無恙、按鳳陽丸上除日員外，共水手司機生火等、均為華人、在滬家屬方面、亦均得悉遇難、故正向招募此輩華人工作之負責人交涉、以期獲得撫卹金、按鳳陽丸係於八日駛出浦江、所載糧秣價值、亦達數十萬金之譜、故全部損害、統計百餘萬元、</p>

<p>土山灣日運輸站被襲</p>
<p>閘北寶山路一帶、昨晚（二十四日）槍聲甚密、據日方承認、係華方便衣隊企圖襲擊閘北　政務公署、當被日軍奮力擊退云云、足徵閘北方面、我游擊隊已在積極活動、且已將各種要交通綫、早已控制、待機出擊、</p>
<p>日軍戒嚴</p>

<h3>拯救短小劇本的飢荒</h3>
<p>— 葉富根</p>
<p>－由劇藝社星期公演說到劇本創作－</p>
<p>「劇本荒」，這一演劇運動中的嚴重病象，隨藩演劇工作之越展開而越形嚴重。如何解救「劇本荒」這一問題，成爲幾年來演劇工作者會議中的重要課題，而迄未解決。這是演劇運動所以不能跟客觀條件相配合，發展到它應該到達和可以到達之階段的主要原因之一。</p>
<p>抗戰之前，由於「光明」半月刋，「戲劇時代」和「新演劇」等雜誌的較多量登載劇本，算是奠下了抗戰前夜的移動演劇隊和抗戰初起時蓬勃的救亡演劇隊的一部分劇末基礎。可是隨着抗戰形勢的展開，演劇形勢激變，比之文化部門中的任何藝術分野，演劇工作是以最高的速度展開了工作之後，一則由於演出需要驟增，舊的劇本立刻感覺到不够應用；一則由於客觀條件與觀衆對象之改變與擴大，舊的劇本自然地不適宜應用，於是「劇本荒」的病象也就更嚴重了。遺憾的是擁有多數劇作家並且有着素以寫劇快手見稱的田漢先生爲領導的第三廳藝術處，於調度演劇隊伍之外，也未能有系統有計劃地生產與供應大量的劇本給各地演劇隊。自然各地演劇隊根據各自的演劇據點來創作，赶製與改編適合於各該地地方性的劇本，固然可以收到特殊的演出效果；可是有着普遍性的主題之適合一般演出的劇本能大量散佈，它的普遍效果當更可觀的。</p>
<p>直到四個月前，在本埠申報的重慶通訊中，我們才見到敎育部「以抗戰劇本爲宣傳利器，特公開微求的的辦法十三條。如第一條之規定：「爲獎勵劇本創作，並使一般民衆對抗戰建國有深切認識起見，特公開徵求有利抗戰建國之話劇歌劇優良劇本，以備戲劇界公演之用」。當是企圖解救「劇本荒」的具體辦法之一了。</p>
<p>這個公開徵求所訂定的辦法是相當周詳具體的：講種類十分多幕劇與獨幕劇兩種；講性質，包括話劇與歌劇（指平劇與川劇）；論形式，注意在都市與鄉村均能演出；製作方式是以新創作尚未發表者爲主，由國外佳著改譯或舊有歌劇改編者爲輔；評選是經敎育部聘定專家組織評選委員會；獎勵是備有現金，版權仍歸作者所有。</p>
<p>徵求的限期三月底就在眼前了。應徵的劇本有多少？其中優良的和可以應用的數目大不大？可能解救「劇本荒」到若干程度？這非遠在上海孤島而和敎育部毫無接觸的我們所得而知的。但願這决微求的結果是收穫甚豐，成績優良，能够解救「劇本荒」的嚴重病象的大半才好。</p>
<p>這兒，話得說近來。希望儘管希望，即使敎育部這决徵求劇本獲得美滿的成效，對於我們此時此地的演劇工作中的「劇本荒」病象，會有多少裨益與救治呢？客觀條件的限制如此的嚴！可用的劇本與新出的創作如此的少！而相反的，需要却大大地增加了。看吧：藝林劇社在卡爾登戲院星期早塲中炒的是「冷飯」。業餘戲劇交誼社在綠寶劇塲的演出中雖有三分之一是新作，可是距離其餘的三四十個小劇團所需求的供給量重相差太還了。上海劇藝社呢？大公演用的多幕長劇，雖能自足自給，而所公佈的星期實驗公演的上演目錄中，一部分是頗難差强人意的！顯然的。演出限制比之內地桎梏十倍，創作自山比之內地又缺少許多。小公演中短小劇本的缺少簡直是由飢荒形成餓病了。</p>
<p>怎麼辦呢？病在自已身上，自己得扶病服藥。上海短小劇本的飢荒，得由我們上海劇人自己來拯救的。</p>
<p>本來，演出工作與劇本創作是相互因果的。演出與創作之間有着矛盾的對立，也存在着矛盾的統一性。有時內着演出機會缺少，空氣沉寂，創作風氣會隨之低落；相反的有時因爲創作劇本多或者好，會激起演出工作的高潮；這是相互影響的因果作用。有時因着演出機會多向且緊張，劇作者忙于舞台工作，少有書桌上的寫作時間，創作劇本會隨着减少；道是兩者之間的矛盾。（自然，這兒所謂創作减少，是指劇本創作的量。一個忙于參加舞台實際工作的劇作者產生的劇本，在質方面常常會超越于一個終日伏案埤頭製造的編劇家的）。有時因爲演出機會多而且緊張，實際的需要會刺激着劇作者多產生作品；這是兩個工作關係的統一。</p>
<p>現在，我們應該把小演出工作與短劇的創作工作如何聯糸起來呢？這是演劇工作者如何適當地配合雙方，兼程並進的問題了。只有解決這個問題，星期早塲公演中的劇本飢荒，才能拯救得了。</p>
<p>這兒，讓我把敎育部徵求劇本辦法中關於所限應微劇本的題材範圍，抄下來供給有心於劇本創作的同志，做個參考</p>
<p>（甲）闡明國家民族利益高於一切，提高人民爲國家民族效忠之信念者。</p>
<p>（乙）鼓勵各界同胞化除一切成見，澈底精誠團結，統一意志，擁護領袖，擁護政府，實現抗戰建國之政策者。</p>
<p>（丙）暴露×寇之暴行，及其野心者。</p>
<p>（丁）說明全面長期的抗戰策略，以堅定人民最後勝利之信念者。</p>
<p>（戊）提倡生產建設，節的，獻金，國民兵役，義務勞動，出錢出力，以增强抗戰力量者。</p>
<p>（已）表揚忠烈，劃除漢奸，淸滅茍安與頹靡思想，以鞏面後方者。</p>
<p>（庚）其他有激勵民心，裨益於抗戰建國之壯烈史蹟，或有益於世道人心之現代故事者。</p>
<p>注：以上七條，照錄一月份申報敎育欄重慶通訊。</p>
<p>把這些取村範圍作爲前題，配合上此時此地的特殊條件，活用這特殊環境中發生與存在着的特殊，普遍與典型的人事來形象化，可歌可泣，旣悲且壯的故事或素材；可以謳歌，可以諷刺，可以暴露，可以暗示的對象與事蹟，不是儘多着麼？寫吧，朋友！你有寫劇的經騐，能技巧地編製，自然可以成功。否則的話，只消態度忠實，用寫實的手法，眞摯的情緒，活生的形象，樸素地抒寫出來，也可以不失爲上品的。</p>
<p>末了，我謹以菊池寬的話轉贈給有心寫劇而還沒有試過的靑年劇人，作爲鼓勵，以代結束吧：</p>
<p>「小說是不容易學的，沒有敎法，也沒有學法的。戲曲呢，因爲有着一種格式，所以容易學，而且用功的效果，也能够看得出來的。比之小說，容易入門，容易進步」。</p>
<p>「現在的新進戲曲家的萎靡之第一個原因，是不用功而已」。</p>
<p>「除出全無文藝素質的人之外，祇要肯用功，和當的戲曲，是不致於寫不出的」！</p>
<p>「戲曲祗要能够繼續用功，好的作品一定可以得到的，祇要能够做出好的作品來，不論怎樣無名之士，也可以一躍成名的。和小說比起來，戲曲的勝負容易決定……」</p>
<p>朋友，你旣沒有上前綫去博國家民族的勝負，何不在劇本寫作上博個勝負呢？來吧，試一試，拯救劇本的飢荒。</p>
<h3>賭徒的末路</h3>
<p>— 陳煥龍作</p>
<h3>「怪人復活」觀感</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>“Son　Of　Frankensteiu”</p>
<p>環球公司出品　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>以演員陣容來看，「怪人復活」無疑的將是一張愛看恐怖片的觀衆所注意的片子。「科學怪人」卡洛夫，「殭屍」羅哥西，還有，在彩色恐怖片「臘像陳列所之秘密」中給人留下深刻印象的里昂安德威，都在這裹互「別苗頭」；以這樣的堂堂之陣，所謂集「恐怖份子」於一堂，在「生意眼」的號召上，當然是有其聲勢的，但就在這樣集「恐怖份子」於一堂的「聲勢」中，我們却也看到了恐怖片的走上强弩之末的命遝。好萊塢的被雇用的編劇家旣枮竭了離奇荒誕的念頭，製片家們又不願放棄恐怖片的攝製，於是遂不得不以集「恐怖份子」於一堂來作「生意眼」的號召了。</p>
<p>其實，一張恐怖片如果單獨靠幾個演員來支撑塲面，那是做不到的；最主要的因素，與其說是演員，倒還不如說是攝影，效果，乃至化裝；而決定他們的靈魂的，則是導演的織接。編劇呢，以我所看過的幾張片子而論，則差不多都是盜用了科學的名義，以他們的幻念來蠱惑觀衆，其中成份的多少，祗是幻念的强弱而已。</p>
<p>「怪人復活」，也是如此。並且爲了便利，這還是「科學怪人」的賡續，劇中的主角，巳不是佛蘭根史亭男爵，而是他的令郎華爾福了，「華爾福偶至男爵生前研究科學之實騐室察看，不期與瘋癲失常之牧人耶戈相遇，耶因盜屍被判絞刑，執行後棄屍亂崗中，不意耶頸雖斷，竟得不死，匿居男爵實騐室內，與怪人爲伍，唆使怪人撲殺村中陪審員六人。耶戈導華至男爵墓穴，則見科學怪人僵臥其內，華頗駭異，耶謂怪人爲電所擊，致昏迷不省人事，懇華爲其治療。華夙喜研究科學，聞言不覺按癢」，於是爲其治療，於是又爲患桑梓，又於是、「怪人失足墮落於沸騰之硫磺坑內」，於是結束。</p>
<p>如上面所說，恐怖片中之所謂「科學」，那祗是編劇者的幻念的代名詞。由著這幻念的馳騁，他可以爲所欲爲，而且，也馳騁出了假托的「科學」之外，如本片中的耶戈，便是「頸雖斷竟得不死」，而且還能唆使怪人出外狙殺陪審員。由於這樣便利的幻念，「怪人」的「復活」，自然也嘸哈希奇，並且可以不必要科學的根據了。</p>
<p>演出成續呢？古堡，墓穴，那孤形的單調的建築，陰森的强烈的光，突如其來的高音，或者，那嗚咽的笛子，慘厲的笑，是一再被應用的，然而那祇是繼續的被應用着，沒有一個重心，也不曾有系統的組織，所以，這些在一般的恐怖片中就爲我們所熟悉的東西，他給我們的印象，也就乎淡得很。槍是要撥動牠的機紐，瞄凖目標，才能殺人的，目標不凖，傷非要害，就也减弱牠的功能，固然，這不是爲殺人者脫罪的理由，可慶幸的是自己，對方祇是一個劣等的射擊手。</p>
<p>要我說演員們的演技，則我是歡喜里昂安德威的，他的折了右臂的探長，使他有了很多演戲的機會；至於卡洛夫和羅哥西祇是保持原狀而已。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第六回　誇人瑞一苗挺三秀　叙友情二士會羣英</p>
<p>到了吃中飯的時候，朱愛人便向她們設道：『下午我要到育嬰院去，你們高與一同去看看吧？』何家兩位小姐聽說到育嬰院去，當然是分外高興。因爲第一就是昨天聽愛人所講的一胎三兒，她們要去瞧瞧。雖然她們自己是個雙胞胎，現在他們也比較地只多了一人，好似覺得十分奇異的了。何儷玉先說道：『愛人姊！我們到育嬰院，可以去看看那方家的三個變生子嗎？你不是昨天巳經應許我們的嗎？』朱愛人笑了一笑道：『自然可以去看。但其實是毫無可看，不過面貌相同的三個小孩子。你們看他們倒不如你們瞧瞧自己好了。』這時何儷玉忽然想起一件事，便和雙玉附耳說了兩句話。原來她想起了昨天朱愛人一句戲謔之言，說是：「不能白給你們看，要出見面錢一的話。雖然她們也知道這句話是說了玩笑的，似乎封於這一胎三兒，應該有一些贈品，最好是玩具之類。但在一待之間，那裏去弄三件同樣的東西呢？她們在附耳商量的時候，可是朱　人非常靈敏。早已覺得了。她說：『你們在商量什麼？我已知道。昨天我是一句笑話，你們竟認眞起來，以爲眞的要見面錢嗎？那我們成了變相的要孩子變把戲了。你們要贈送什麼東西，往後贈送也可以的，不必一定要此刻。况且我們這個育嬰院中，自幼稚時候，即養成一種公共意識。沒有說：那一件玩具，是那一個孩子私有的。所有玩具，是大家都可以玩得的。因此凡是到育嬰院來，看見了這一胎三兒，贈送了衣服玩具之類。但我們也是公開的，並不是專爲方家三個孩子的專有品。但我們想：這公共心，是要從小就養成纔好。』何變玉道：『好！那末我們即使要送東西，慢慢兒的再想送什麼東西好了。』到吃過中飯後，何家兩位小姐，便跟了朱愛人到育嬰院來了。這育嬰院裹，共有三百多嬰孩，男女不相上下。不過那裹的孩子，只撫育到六歲，至多是到七歲。因爲六七歲，便是到初等小學的年齡，不在育嬰院範圍之內，那就要請孩子的父母，或家長，自己想法子了。（七〇）</p>

<h3>倫敦左翼人民演出　反法西斯主義諷刺劇</h3>
<p>— 淡雲</p>
<p>倫敦北部有一所左翼民衆的劇院，名呌一團結戲院一，最近每晚表演一部可說在英國罕見的大阻的政治諷剌劇，居然轟動一時。</p>
<p>這本諷刺劇名爲「森林裹的嬰孩」，原來是脫胎於講給小孩子聽的富言，內容是說一個易受欺騙之年長君子，他的名字呌「壞叔叔」，和兩個實得土地的强盜的事情。現在在「團結」戲院演出的，都是工人，他們在工作之餘，每晚表演這劇本，都是他們自己改編，用以表演捷克的悲劇，並議諷張伯倫，希特勒和墨索里尼，並且把英王和英后也都嘲笑到了。</p>
<p>但是這本諷刺劇的結果却是快樂的，而不像捷克事件那麼的悲慘，因爲劇本裹表演的是那位「壞叔叔」强使受他保獲的小家庭，把地產給强盜以圖苟延殘喘，然而正在危急的當見，却來了個大俠客，拔刀相助，爲了「敎育」民衆，並使人民團結一致起見，大俠客就阻止「壞叔叔」，說不能這麼辦，因此把受「壤叔叔」保護的小家庭保全了，這位大俠客是誰，原來就是羅賓漢。</p>
<p>但是有疑問了，這樣一個諷刺國家元首的戲劇，難道不遭禁止嗎？原來「團結戲院」是一個俱樂部，會員費五角，加票價最低二角五分，最高六角二分，所以檢查員不得過問。</p>
<p>「團結戲院」的地位很小，只能容三百八十人，但是表演到現在，看過這本諷刺劇的，已有一萬四千人，預料在停演之前，還有二萬人前往觀看。</p>
<p>戲院主持者有數個是左傾的智識份子，它們的目的是在協助迫切的爭取世界和平，並以表演現實，反映現生活，而不是祇表現逃避現實的夢的世界的戲劇，來反對法西斯中義。茲得友人惠我四十年前申報一頁，當係油光紙時代，計其年日，尚在光緒年間也。茲轉錄其戲廣告數則如次：</p>

<h3>蒨蒨室劇話</h3>
<p>— 肖傖</p>
<p>美人激賞王玉峯之三絃彈戲　以十萬元邀王赴歐王不允去</p>
<p>遜淸末葉，京師有兩奇人，皆　者：（一）摸骨相家小瞎子，以神相負大名，尤以相袁世凱爲最奇騐。當袁項城三十七　時，由朝鮮避京，頗鬱鬱，訪小瞎子作摸骨相，小瞎子循例摸骨後，謂項城曰：「余相人以一金計，獨君相逈異乎常人，須五金始得贈數語。」項城日：「諾。」小瞎子日：「君之相，四十歲發，六十而殺，一人之下，萬人之上也。」項城是時亦懾於專制淫威，懼爲人知，急退去。後項城果於四十歲時授武衛右軍；從茲一帆風順，名震海內。及五十九歲，服豆苗而死。聞小瞎子卒爲袁氏所段，此說確吾，不得而知矣。（二）瞽者王玉峯，善三絃，指間能發各種戲曲小調軍樂之聲，彈京劇允能逼肖名伶聲口。友人奚燕子先生在三十年前，會在海上三馬路現屬淸一色原址之某影戲館，得以兩兀座值，靜聽王玉峯之三絃彈戲。玉峯指撥間奏二進宮一曲，　生仿譚鑫培，靑衣仿陳德霖，黑頭仿裘桂仙。座中閉目凝聽者，於精采處無不擊節稱賞。今之三絃彈戲及三絃拉戲，殆皆承其餘韻者也。是年，美國富商，重其藝，特與面商，請共赴維多利亞奏技，許以十萬金爲壽，玉峯未允諾也。世人咸驚梅蘭芳赴美赴俄代價之昂，實則王玉峯以一替者，在三十年前，已使歐美人士，大爲傾倒，而其技且僅賴指撥之間；以人傳，若王玉峯者，眞京師之奇人也矣。</p>
<p>談四十年前之戲廣告</p>
<p>戲院廣告，旨在吸引觀衆。海上自成孤島以來，梨園營業，乃成畸形發展，主其事者，廳不致力於廣告宣傳，藉收宏效。以最近言，若黃金之「標準平劇；」共舞台之「當衆脫褲子，墳上壞風水；」大舞台之一飛來一桌和菜，硬碰硬，勿關燈；」卡爾登之脫火向火，坐懷不亂；」天蟾之德霖嫡傳，譚派傳人，」皆各有筆法</p>
<p>上列廣告，因從前申報旣無現在之紙張潔白，且均用五號字刋印；廣告文字純屬老派筆法，較諸今日廣告文字之花樣百出，誠不可同日語矣。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一三〇）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>因探母的出關說到西太后與安得海的關係</p>
<p>這也是他年幼無知，恃功而　的壞處。丁寶楨把小安子問斬後，還晾屍三日，　息謠會。還有人說：他是先割了安得海的小頭，然後冉斫去他的大頭，借此替西太后遮遮醜的。後來西后洞悉一切，自思反正心上人是死了，不如樂得學個大方的主子罷，不但不降罪老丁，反倒把他陞了四川總督。亡消的時候，外任官兒，以總督爲最尊，總督中允以川督爲最美缺分，當年端方，作到兩江總督，還不滿足，甘願以三十萬鉅款，買一任川督玩玩，豈知行至中途，未抵任所，就被革命的先烈把他殺啦。丁寶楨闖了個大禍，反而得到個最優的缺兒，這眞是他作夢都想不到的。</p>
<p>多年前我會聽過粵劇唱片裹　西太后祭安得海　段，詞句很爲哀惋動人，足見他們兩人的一段風流佳話，早年也是傳播極廣的。古北口爲他們發生愛情的起點，「探母」是現今盛極一時的名劇，而這齣戲裹的關口，也是古北口，所以特爲將此兩事，併爲一談。至於四郎與安得海過關的情形，一則係盜取蕭太后令箭，來到關前還要大模大樣，很安閑的唱了四句搖板，告誡把關的人不要偷閑，切莫上了南蠻巧裝改扮的當。其實他是假充字號，全是說的他自己，故而楊四郎可算是混過關去的。講到小安子呢，則父與他不同，他明明懷揣着西太后密旨，却不言過關的這回事，等他與把關人作別的當兒，却學個欲擒故縱的方法，冷不防衝了進去，所以他是位闖關的，混過去是文明的，闖過去是無禮貌的。等到最近演的一幕搶關，恐怕那是更進一步，而變成野蠻的了。</p>

<h3>黃花岡烈士的精神</h3>
<p>— 黃漢瑞</p>
<p>反抗壓迫，推翻專制，不惜付以血肉的代價，這種偉大的精神，很值得我們崇拜。黃花崗一役，死了七十二烈士，祗成了仁而沒有成功，但無疑地這是推翻清政府的主力。辛亥年武昌起義成立了中華民國，正是烈士們灑撥血花的結果。我們景仰先烈，必须要紀念他們的就是：</p>
<p>（一）國家觀念的深刻-普通人都知道家庭而把社會國家的觀念丢開，烈士們能見其大。能看到國家因清庭腐敗而勢將滅亡的時候不得不以生命和壓迫者在槍林彈雨的戰場上拼死活。</p>
<p>（二）富於犧牲精神－烈士的犧牲精神比泰山還重，能拋棄了白己的幸福為大眾謀顺利。他們的不屈不扰再接再厲，正是我們的楷模。</p>
<p>（三）思想新穎－腐敗清廷實在太老朽了，它如存在着，結果，會使中國滅亡。烈士們，有着新的立場，非推翻這陳舊的統治不可，他們正站在時代之尖端。</p>
<p>（四）他們情感的真崇——我們從烈士們訣別父母和妻兒的遺書中看來都能令人流淚，安慰父母，勉勵兒子能繼續奮鬥完成自己未完成的革命工作都是纏綿俳側．他們固然有着堅强的理知，却也有豐富的感情。這正是今日青年的好榜樣。</p>
<p>黄花崗七十二烈士殉難已二十八年了，至今日抗戰時期回想過去，奮鬥的歷程是多末艱苦，在這裏，我們必須繼續烈士的精神來擔負起民族解放的亘古未有的任務，得到最後勝利，那才不辜負了今日的紀念。</p>
<h3>黃花岡的故事</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>假使我們到廣州去的話，白雲山下的黃花崗，我們是一定要去瞻仰的，白石的墳墓，鋼鐵的欄杆，給一座石亭雄踞着，石亭中有一塊碑，那碑上寫着「七十二烈士之墓。」墓的背後有一紀念坊，再後還有一座大石亭，建築得雄偉異常，我們的總理就在這長亭上寫着「浩氣長存」四個字，亭的上面立着一位自由之神。</p>
<p>當我們走到這裏，我們就會想到七十二烈士幹的一椿英勇悲壯的故事：這是清朝宜統三年的事，許多革命同志要求民族的自山，便在三月二十九日那天，受了孫中山先生的指導，大家拿了手槍和炸彈實行第十次革命，出發去攻打廣州總督衙門。</p>
<p>當時由　興任指揮，領了炸彈隊，衝進城去進掣督署，殺得敵人的街隊死的死，逃的逃，聾势浩大，敵人都望風披靡。</p>
<p>擒賊要擒王，黃將軍的意思一定要捉拿總督張鸣岐，正在找　搜索時，大隊清兵救援來了，他们明知敵人眾多，自己人少，是打不過的，但是為了要激起同胞的革命思潮，不顧自身的性命，和清兵作戰，結果打死清兵幾百個，但是革命同志因為後方沒有接觸，有的當時殉難，有的給清兵捉去成仁，除黃將軍手腳中彈依舊率領殘兵殺出外，共有七十二　位烈士很悲壯的為革命而犧牲了。</p>
<p>他們死後，又一位潘達微先生把他們的屍體，合葬在廣州城東白雲山的黃花崗下，那裏便成了我國唯一的光榮紀念地。</p>
<h3>大嘴吧的吃飯本領</h3>
<p>— 十三歲小畫家江小流君作</p>
<h3>敏於事慎於言</h3>
<p>— 單世雄</p>
<p>「敏於事慎於言」是一句至理名言。</p>
<p>事就是行的意義，平時有句話所謂言行一致」常常在耳朶內聽到，可是實際上有許多人是「言不顧行」或許是「行不顧言」，這種人的高談闊論，縱或是拿手好戲，然而儘管他的言語如何的響亮，他的闊論如何的嚣張，可是因為意識不正確，或所做的事情不能適應實際，因此没有一件事是能底於成功的。又有許多人他們只是埋頭苦幹，在平時雖很少開口，可是這種人所做出的事，其結果却往往是成功的。譬如蘇聯的史太林，在十幾年以前不知道遭到許多極大的挫折，可是他能够敏於事慎於言，再加上耐勞果敢的精神，所以經過他二次五年計劃的奮鬥，到目前已把蘇聯這個國家造成富强的地步了。再如我國的蔣委員長，他無論於軍事政治都一敏慎地處　，而對於一件事情在未做之前，他早已胸有成竹，所以他現在够得上被稱為抗敵復興的領袖。</p>
<p>我們對於古人所說的「敏於事慎於言」，如果能夠切實地做到，那麼我們立身處世一能得到許多的益處，而於我們的學問事業，也必能有相當的成就。</p>
<p>「言多必失」，這句話的解釋就是說一個人言語多了難免又錯失的地方，但是照我看来，這句話也未必是正確的。因為我覺得一個人所要講而應講的話，不妨盡量的說出来，不過在未購之前，必須要加以一番思考，那麼這種人，方能成其偉大了。</p>
<p>由此觀之，一個人的言語辦事都要「敏」而「慎」，而要成功不平凡的事業和學問，也得養成一種「敏於事慎於言」的習慣。</p>
<h3>談天</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>——明兒避難記之十七——</p>
<p>順風順水，是船夫們心目中最歡迎的，又省力，又迅速。可是明兒的船是向錢塘江的上游駛行，當然沒有順水的希望，因此他們只是日夜盼望唯一的順風。這天上午，老天很是不帮忙，打着一陣小的逆風，而到了下午，風向不知怎的改變了，一陣陣的風從船尾上吹來，於是船夫們喜出望外的，忙把一張挺大的帆掛在高高的桅桿上，那帆飽受了風的催促，似乎使船增加了不少的威力，而戰勝水浪的凶換，終於克服了它的阻力，而頓時加快了船的速度。船夫們的面容上也似乎蒙上了一層欣喜的顏色，各自拿了烟斗到船尾上去抽烟了。那船老大（船夫稱他為「駕長」，表示尊敬之稱）也在船頭上抽烟，明兒這時從沈悶的船艙中腾出來，換換空氣。他眼見那船老大此刻很是得意的坐着，於是他心中有許多疑問去問他，乘着這個很好的機會。　　　　．</p>
<p>「船老大，今天行了多少路？」明兒带着一些「藍青」官話問着他。「今天，你猜猜看。」船老大不肯回答他，一二十里」「是的，」明兒心中一喜，自以為猜得很對，後來才知道不是，明兒的聰明原来船上是很迷信的，如果船在顺風行的時候，切不可問船已行了多少路了。假如問這問題，顺風要不會再吹得久了，明兒暗暗笑他們的迷信。不過這幾句話，竟打開了他們倆的話匣子，明兒滔滔不絕的問着。</p>
<p>「這船造了幾年？多少錢？你是什麼地方人？到屯溪要多少日子？」這樣一大串的問題，不肯放鬆似的直逼着船老大回答，害得在船槍中明兒的父親也在暗暗笑了。</p>
<p>我是富陽地方的人。從這裏過去沒有多少略了。我從小就跟着父親在船上過沾長大，成家，算算我在船上已吃了三十多年的飯。船上飯是不好吃的，不論什麼日子，什麼天氣，落專下雨，大热天，都要撑船．你想想六月裹的火燒太陽照在我們的背上，似乎在發燒，背上起泡是家常便飯，有時候竟要發爛。在大冷天，我們仍得赤着脚，在冰水中，在雪地上做我們的工作，這種苦飯我是吃怕了。想找些別的行業做做，像我這個笨坯，怎麼能幹得下？只得過一日是兩個半日的算了。一這船已造了七年多了，我們用得很愛惜，所以還見得很新。造船的價錢，在那時還便宜，一百多塊已够，現在可不肯了。一隻船修理費也是很大的，每年要揩桐油，裝修艙裏的一切東西，所以算算每年還要加上二三十塊的小利錢。我們兄弟倆都是撑船的，不吹牛，在富陽也稍有一些小名聲，這因為我們做事老老實實的，無論代客人運貨物，買賣，都是規規矩矩。到屯溪，沒有一定的日子，我們是靠天吃飯，上游要半月左右，如果順風，那麼快一些十天左右也可到，而下游只要一個禮拜已够了。」這麼長的一段話，聽得明兒很有滋味，船老大說完了這許多話，便打着口哨，明兒知道他是在催風快快吹來。「真滑稽，風怎麼會受人的支配呢？」他暗喑的說着。他還想繼續問下去，那知母親來叫他去吃晚飯，他一聽到吃，便一轉身的走到艙裏去了。</p>
<h3>介紹一個兒童研究所學的團體</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>誰都知道二十世紀，是一個科學的世界；二十世紀人類的生活，需要過着科舉的生活，我們要想替世界謀進化，為人類造幸福，非努力研究科學不可。只有科學的兒童，才是未來新世界的建設者，人類新生活的創造者！</p>
<p>這裹，我要介紹你們一個兒童科學研究團體。那是一　歡喜科學，爱好自然的小朋友所組織的，成立於民國二十四年六月六日，最初参加的社員，又是六十六人，所以定名為六六兒童科學研究杜。他們所抱的宗旨是：「使兒童滿足求知的欲望，得到共同研究的利益，並養成研究科舉的興趣和習慣。」</p>
<p>他們原在京滬綫安亭鎮上，正研究得高高興興的時候，不料八一二的砲聲一響，把他們的工作打斷，它的原地址淪陷了。現在有一部分社員，逃出了那惡環境，在上海復社，繼續以往的精神，開展未來的光榮。</p>
<p>每學期中，他們召集全體社員，開大會一次，討論社務的進行。每月舉行一次研究會，有時規定研究的中心，或改行演說會，辯論會，實地觀察，實驗表演，徵文懸賞等活動每週士曜日出版「科學兒童」一期，附刊於兒童日報，為社員互相研究，報告心得的園地。</p>
<p>他們的組織，分圖書，研究，出版等三股，並設社長，文書，會計各一人，現有社員七十多人，都佩带着一個梅花形的「66」社徽。社員在入社時，須繳入社費二角，以後每學期每人納常費二角。</p>
<p>現在他們打算擴大組織，繼續徵求新社員，預備發動全上海的小朋友，共同作科學上的探討。凡是年在十歲至十六歲的小朋友不論在小學裏續書的，或學工學商的，只要對於科學有興趣的，都可加入，　是小朋友們研究科學的一個好機會。</p>
<p>可敬的小朋友們：起來研究科學吧：把自己造成一個科學的兒童，去建設新的世界，創造新的生活吧！</p>
<p>小朋友的小園地</p>
<h3>黃花岡紀念日</h3>
<p>— 秦羣小學六年級生　陳荷</p>
<p>整個的悲哀，壓抑，我的喜悅，又加上了那無情的半旗，飄揚在宇宙之中，使人凄凉異常，感慨萬分。</p>
<p>翻開二十八年前歷史上的一頁，只見廣州城中砲火連天，血肉横飛，真是人類的悲劇，世間之地狱。</p>
<p>在事實上是沒有尺寸地的成功，但是他們的精神，和他們的毅力，是值得我們羡慕而欽佩的啊！</p>
<p>他們是為着過去的祖先，為着未來的兒孫，而為國家犧牲了，但也是光榮而不巧的了。</p>
<p>他們已是為國而機牲了我們應該鍛煉好思想，運動好體格，拿七十二位烈士作榜樣，做將來的社會中堅，國家柱石，抵抗　武的侵略者，向光明的大道邁進，以爭取民族的榮光。</p>
<h3>放風箏</h3>
<p>— 上海小學五年級生　楊益</p>
<p>唉又是每年放風箏等的時候了。但是那時候才能回家去在　野裏大大地放一下呢？</p>
<p>記得往年在故鄉的時候，當約了鄰居同伴，到田野裏放風箏，我們拿定了綫，跑東跑西，那風箏也就跟着我們在空中飄來飄去，突然來了一層暴風，綫斷了，風箏也飛到別處去了。</p>
<p>回想當年，真是快樂啊。但是今日呢，家裏不能回去了，抬起頭來望望空中，只有銀色的飛機在日光下閃閃地發光，那裏來風箏的踪跡呢。</p>
<p>小朋友們！我們幾時才呢放風箏啊！</p>
<h3>寫字的方法</h3>
<p>— 惠小學六年級生　徐修鑫</p>
<p>各位小朋友，我們是中國人，應當把中國文字練得很好，練得好的固然很多，可是姿勢打都不對，現在我把他簡略地寫在下面。</p>
<p>中國文字，大約分七種：（一）古文，（二）大篆，（三）小篆，（四）隸書，（五）草書，（六）正楷，（七）行書，現在就是講第六種正楷，所以先講正楷的寫法，在從前有三種寫法：（一）描紅，（二）映字，（三）　貼，現在所講是臨帖，臨帖寫法有五：（一）運筆，運筆者中有分三種：（一）懸腕法，（二）運肘法，（三）　腕法，（一）姿勢，要對正　面，軀幹挺直，兩臂平放，手腕和　面平行，右臂，左臂成直角，筆鋒又中鋒偏鋒二種，磨墨要平而慢。</p>
<p>我們寫中楷用運肘法，楷用運腕法，筆鋒須用中鋒。</p>
<h3>死了的母親</h3>
<p>— 民生小學五年級生　夏子良</p>
<p>在一個寂靜的黑夜裏，突然我心裏充滿了悲觀和恐怖的想念。於是我便回憶起我最親愛的母親。</p>
<p>在我八歲的時候，母親便離開了我，多麼痛心啊！我每天看見許多小朋友都是叫着親愛的母親，然而我是再也沒有母親了。</p>
<h3>白雪公主　（一二　）</h3>
<p>— 天孫</p>
<p>這一夜在那七矮人的小屋子裏,也正吃得不可開交，他們忙的事什麼呢，原來是在忙着做聯歡的工作，大家興高采烈，快樂得甚麼似的。</p>
<p>於是他們開始舉行一個慶祝會了。老頑固在屋中一個黑暗的壁角裏找到了一隻小拉琴，上面刻滿着飛鳥和青蛙的。他雙手拉動，奏出一套森林中的曲調來。別的矮人們也各有自己創造的小樂器，和着老頑固彈奏歌唱，樂不可支。歌唱完畢之後，放下了樂器，再來跳舞一下，那種奇怪有趣的步武，也是他們自己創造出來的。他們自己跳了不算，又請白雪公主輪流的和他們合舞，七矮人一一跳過，累得伊倒在椅中，連氣也透不過来，但是伊那一寸芳心中，却充滿了喜氣。</p>
<p>正在這當兒，那鐘上的門刷的開了，裏面有一頭金屬製的杜鵑跳出来，喀咕喀咕的連叫了十聲。白雪公王即忙坐了起來道：「咦，早已過了規定的睡眠時間了！此刻你們快些兒上樓去睡覺吧！</p>
<p>但那七矮人都不肯去，定要把他們的牀讓給白雪公主睡覺。白雪公主拗不過他們，祇得上一樓去了。走到了樓梯的頂上，他們還抬着頭向伊嚷着道；願你好好的睡，做一個好夢！」白雪公主到了臥房裏，便跪下来祈禱，願上帝降福於七矮人，因為他們實在待伊太好了。末了兒伊更加上一句道：「並且請你特別帮個忙兒，使老頑固改變過來，也像我一模一樣！」那時王官的的王后，已化装成了一個賣雜貨的老婆婆，預備動身到七矮人這兒來了。伊裝了一籃子的　见，而很當心的把一那毒蘋果放在上面，以免臨時弄錯。最後伊才向伊那頭寵爱的烏鴉告別，並且向它說道：「寶貝，下次你瞧見我時，我不會再像這樣的老醜了。從今夜起，我仍是容華絕世，仍是世上一個最最美麗的女人！而自雪那小東西，可要活活生生的被埋在地下，結束伊的小生命了！」</p>
<p>在天將破曉的時光，王后便蹣跚着走出地道，簡直是一個老醜可怕的老婆子，在王宫的下面，有一條黑溪，像一尾蛇那麼曲曲折折地流去，伊把一隻繫在岸邊的小船解了纜繩，拿起一根　子來，在雲霧漫天中順流撑開去了。</p>
<p>撑了好一會，見那溪水流入森林，分明已到达目的地了。王后把船傍了岸，跳上岸去，躡手躡腳地向着那七愛人的小屋子走去。</p>
<p>這大早上，七矮人因為昨晚睡得遲，所以起身也比平日遲了一些。他們每夜總是睡得很早，一輩子從沒有在十點鐘以後才睡覺的。白公主先就起身了，給他們做了一頓又熱又美的早餐，站在門口，把七個小包子遞給他們，原來是七個肉麵包。</p>
<p>博士先就警告白公主道：「論是誰，你千萬不要讓他闖進這屋子裏來。因為那王后是一個狡猾不過的女人，也許要弄出什麼花樣來對付你。」</p>
<p>白公主主忙道：「你不要担心，我身上不會有什麼岔子的。」</p>
<p>老頑固接口道：「我也要警告你一聲，那王后是甚麼都幹得出來的，你還是小心些的好！」</p>
<p>七矮人向白雪公主說了一聲再會，便出門上工去了。他們的七個背影剛在遠處沒去，那些小動物頓時聚了攏來，領導着白公主到那屋子近旁的醋栗　中去，採了一桶鮮美的醋栗，開始做起醋栗包子來。</p>
<p>伊在爐旁烘好了七個小小的醋栗包子，在每個包子上刻出七矮人的各個名字，字體是卷曲而美觀的。小動物們在一旁瞧着，都嘖嘖的讚美。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Northern Jiangxi Plan to Invade Nanchang in Three Routes; Chinese Troops Counterattack Separately, Situation Stabilizes; Central Route Continues to Hold Positions North of Tu Jia Bu; Fierce Fighting in Wan Jia Bu, Anyi, and Fengxin in the West; Confirmation of Deaths of Two Japanese Regiment Commanders, Iino, etc.</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Chinese army on the front line of Nanxun was still repairing the south bank of the river last night, firmly defending the area west of the railway. On the 23rd night, the Chinese army launched a counterattack, engaging in fierce fighting throughout the night, pushing the Japanese troops back to the line of Liu Zhuang Panxi City, which is now under Chinese control. There were no changes in the fighting in Wuning. The Japanese attempt to outflank the right wing of Wuning has failed. The fiercest fighting is taking place along the Liao River near the Wan Jia Bu and Anyi ferry crossings. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, and several Japanese motorboats in the river were also sunk. Near Fengxin, the Chinese army also destroyed several Japanese tanks. A certain commander-in-chief has issued an order to commend the meritorious Chinese army.

<p>(Nanchang) The Japanese troops who had sneaked from Tanxi to Wan Jia Bu are now causing disturbances in the direction of Anyi and Fengxin, seemingly attempting to invade Nanchang. The newly arrived Chinese reinforcements arrived in time, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army. The remaining Japanese troops were blocked and retreated northwest. (Dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Xiushui The battles on both sides of the Xiushui River are gradually improving. The Japanese army, with a part of the 6th Division, attacked the Wuning area of the Chinese side from Zhuxi for five days. Not only did they make no progress, but they were also subjected to a major blow from the Chinese side. Starting on the 23rd, the Chinese XX Loyal Army, with the spirit of advancing without retreat and having China but not Japan, launched a counterattack from Wuning. In the fierce battles at Da Nao Jian and Coffin Mountain, 30 miles northeast of Wuning, for two days and two nights, they not only repelled all the attacking Japanese troops but also annihilated more than 1,500 Japanese troops. At the foot of Da Nao Jian and in Coffin Mountain, they captured more than 100 rifles, 12 machine guns, and hundreds of documents.

<p>Xiushui Wucheng, protruding from the lakeside at the confluence of the Xiushui and Gan Rivers, has stood firm since the 18th under the intense bombing of Japanese naval, land, and air artillery. On the morning of the 24th, more than ten Japanese planes and thirty or forty warships bombed and shelled for six hours, turning Wucheng Town into scorched earth. Most of the fortifications were destroyed. However, the loyal and brave Chinese army still used the ruined walls and broken ruins as cover, calmly resisting. At dawn, a Japanese warship team sailed south of the town and forcibly landed. Although the Chinese army was attacked from both sides, they were still fighting hard under difficult circumstances. (Dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Guilin On the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese army advanced on the Chinese from Haxi Long Yejiazhou in several routes and fired a large number of incendiary bombs. At 5 PM, a fire broke out in Wucheng, and the current situation is unclear.

<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is currently attempting to encircle Nanchang from three directions: east, west, and north. It is reported that one route of Japanese troops landing on the east bank of Poyang Lake is attempting to attack Nanchang from the east, with the immediate goal of cutting off the railway and highway traffic between Jiangxi Province and Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces. The central route of the Japanese army is advancing towards Nanchang along the Nanxun Road from Yongxiu. The third route of the Japanese army crossed the Xiushui River at Qiujin and is advancing south, attempting to cut off the main highway and railway line between Nanchang and Hunan Province. It is said that this route of the Japanese army is the closest to Nanchang and poses the greatest threat to the Chinese positions north of Nanchang. The vanguard of this route includes mechanized units and is reported to have reached Anyi and Fengxin, 45 miles west of Nanchang. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Japanese troops at Coffin Mountain, Wang Ren Nao, Jia Bai Lao, and other places on the north bank of the Xiushui River were fiercely attacked by a Chinese army unit, resulting in many Japanese casualties. Yesterday morning, the Japanese army was unable to hold out and retreated towards the Fanxi Bridge. The positions there have been completely recovered. At the moment, the Chinese army is advancing towards the Dajiao River and the Hezhang Street area. The Japanese troops at Nanluopu on the Xiushui River were bravely counterattacked by the Chinese army on the night of the 23rd. The battle was extremely fierce. On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese troops fled east in disarray, and the area was also recovered. The remaining Japanese troops are currently being mopped up. (Dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Xiushui After the Japanese army forcibly crossed the Xiushui River at Gouzi Ridge between Qiujin and Yongxiu, they used Tanxi as a base. On the 23rd, they divided into two routes: one advanced wildly along the highway towards Wan Jia Bu and Anyi, and the other rushed fiercely along the ancient road towards Ganzhou, between Anyi and Jing'an. After the Chinese army resisted separately, the Japanese troops attacking Wan Jia Bu and Anyi have been repelled. The Japanese army suffered more than 600 dead and wounded. As for the Japanese troops disturbing the area south along the ancient road, they are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army north of the Zhongliao River. (Dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to military observers, the Japanese army's decision to attack Nanchang still employs its usual tactic of flanking attacks. Since the start of the war, the Japanese army has only won major battles through flanking attacks. At present, the Chinese and Japanese armies are engaged in fierce fighting along a 70-mile front along the Xiushui River. However, the Japanese army in the upper reaches of the Xiushui River has already advanced south along the highway towards Nanchang. According to military reports, the Japanese army has already advanced to Anyi, 20 miles east of Nanchang, and Fengxin, 30 miles away. The Japanese army is attempting to cut off the main retreat route of the Chinese army in Nanchang, 40 miles west of Nanchang. The Japanese army intends to cut off the Nanchang-Changsha highway, causing the entire Chinese army front along the Xiushui River to collapse. According to the Central Daily News, fierce fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies is taking place along a 70-mile front along the Xiushui River, even more fierce than the fighting in the Shanghai area. In the past few days, more than 100 Japanese bombers have been busy taking turns bombing and strafing Chinese troop positions. However, the Chinese army positions in the Xiushui River basin are extremely solid, except for one loophole in the highway leading to Nanchang. All Japanese attacks along the Xiushui River have been repelled by the Chinese army. A Japanese brigade commander was killed by the Chinese army, but his name is unknown. According to the Sao Dang Bao, yesterday, 200 Japanese troops from the advance force, carrying seven armored vehicles, advanced to the Anyi and Fengxin area and encountered fierce resistance from the Chinese army. The result is unknown. (Associated Press dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the fighting in northern Jiangxi is still raging. On the 23rd, the Chinese army launched a vigorous counterattack and, after repeated hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army, drove back the Japanese troops who had sneaked to the Fengxin area on the south bank of the Liao River. The Japanese army suffered more than 1,500 casualties and two regiment commanders were killed in action. The Japanese army's decision to launch a large-scale southward offensive still adopts a roundabout strategy, concentrating its main force and advancing south along the Liao River on the west side of the Nanxun Road, attempting to break through the main force of the Chinese army in order to cut off the traffic between Nanchang and Wuning Pingjiang. In addition to crossing the river from the south bank of the Liao River to launch an attack, the Chinese army is also advancing in a roundabout way from XX to encircle the flanks of the Japanese army.

<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese claim to have occupied Wucheng is incorrect. According to Chinese reports, Zhang Jia Shan, the outpost of Wucheng, is still in the hands of the Chinese army. Therefore, the claim that the Japanese army has entered Wucheng is difficult to believe. In addition, according to private news from Chongqing, the Japanese navy in Poyang Lake has not yet been able to land, because the Chinese army has set up artillery positions all along the west bank, and their range can reach 100 meters into the lake. Even if Japanese suicide squads dare to risk landing, they will all trigger the landmines pre-buried by the Chinese army and be completely annihilated. It is learned that the Chinese army in Wucheng has prepared for street fighting. Even if the Japanese army invades the city one day, every house will have fortifications, and the Japanese army will not be able to occupy Wucheng without paying a heavy price.

The Japanese army used artillery fire to break through the city walls and engaged in street fighting with the Chinese army for two hours, killing more than 30 more Japanese troops. Because the Japanese army was numerous and the Chinese army was few, the Chinese army withdrew from the city. Wan County fell into Japanese hands again. (Dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>The National Spiritual Mobilization in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The National Spiritual Mobilization has already begun to be implemented in Shanghai. Many people are sincerely and enthusiastically working on it, while many others treat it as an empty slogan, talking about it weakly, and even more people hold an indifferent attitude, not knowing what it is all about. Although this is a phenomenon that inevitably occurs at the beginning of every movement; however, this spiritual mobilization is indeed too important, and it is especially necessary to promote it rapidly and universally in Shanghai, this isolated island. Therefore, we should loudly call for the Shanghai citizens to thoroughly understand, unite, and strive to participate.</p>
<p>In general, although social evolution has the inevitability of a material foundation, without the active engagement of human will, it cannot promote the rapid arrival of a new era and achieve the expected results. Regarding the situation of China's resistance against Japan, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Weapons are material, and the ability to use these weapons depends entirely on the spirit. Compared to the two, spiritual strength accounts for nine parts, and material strength accounts for only one part." Therefore, spiritual strength has a decisive effect in warfare; and in the past year and a half, the concentration of national will has been far from sufficient, so that the Japanese side has repeatedly tried to take advantage of the gaps to strike at the spirit of the Chinese people and win over hearts. Now, in the second phase of the war, where success or failure, prosperity or ruin are at stake, we must rise up in time, implement the National Spiritual Mobilization, and make it the basis for building an army, building the nation, overcoming the enemy, and achieving victory (Summary of Chiang Kai-shek's telegram). Furthermore, regarding the special situation in Shanghai, all four million citizens are Chinese nationals, but there is a lack of universal national salvation organizations, a lack of political leadership, and at the same time, the other side's propaganda and bewitchment are intensifying day by day. For the sake of strengthening the anti-Japanese front, how can we build a Great Wall of the will of the Shanghai citizens, gather the individuals of the four million citizens, and transform them into a unified anti-Japanese force? It is all the more necessary to promote spiritual mobilization.</p>
<p>Shanghai citizens should recognize that National Spiritual Mobilization is not a formula, not a slogan, but a guiding principle for practice. Shanghai citizens should recognize that National Spiritual Mobilization is not an idle article in the anti-Japanese war, but an important factor in striving for victory. Shanghai citizens should recognize that National Spiritual Mobilization is needed not only on the front lines, but also in the rear, and especially in Shanghai, this isolated island society.</p>
<p>National Spiritual Mobilization has an outline and implementation methods. Theory and practice complement each other, with connectivity and integrity; but Shanghai citizens may wish to examine the objective environment and subjective needs and especially emphasize the following points:</p>
<p>The five spiritual reform items of the Spiritual Mobilization are all important guiding principles aimed at the shortcomings of the Chinese national spirit and the needs of the anti-Japanese war. Among them, Shanghai citizens should pay special attention to the two items "The life of indulgence must be corrected" and "The divergent and confused thoughts must be corrected." Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the sound of cannons has become more and more distant, and the neon lights have become brighter and brighter. The songs and dances in the theaters have consumed so much of the strength of the anti-Japanese war. The current problem is not that Shanghai citizens do not know that living in indulgence is inappropriate, but that there is no strong organization to correct it. National Spiritual Mobilization is organizational. Shanghai citizens should use the power of this organization to implement the so-called "supervision and persuasion" work, and thoroughly clear the decadent air on the isolated island. Furthermore, since Shanghai lost government control, the majority of citizens firmly hold the belief that the anti-Japanese war will be won and the nation will be built. However, elements with unsteady beliefs or wavering wills also hide in the foreign concessions in corners that people do not pay much attention to, acting as echo chambers for the other side's dissemination of spiritual toxins. National Spiritual Mobilization can enable Shanghai citizens in the future to exert the power of organization, carry out a scorched-earth policy of national consciousness, and eliminate all toxic thoughts.</p>
<p>Secondly, the twelve articles of the National Oath are the wartime code of conduct for Chinese nationals, of which nine articles are of a nature of non-cooperation with the enemy. Shanghai citizens should especially abide by them. Originally, although Shanghai citizens are squeezed into special districts, they actually have, and are likely to have, traffic with the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The consolidation of the puppet regime in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the determination of Shanghai citizens to resist Japan, and the guerrilla war have a very important relationship. If Shanghai citizens can completely sever ties with the Japanese puppets, visibly and invisibly, it would at least be a fatal blow to the Japanese puppet regime in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, in order to express their determination to love the country, Shanghai citizens should actively strive to abide by the National Oath and thoroughly promote the non-cooperation movement with the Japanese puppets.</p>
<p>Again, the four million citizens of the isolated island lack universal national salvation organizations. Spiritual Mobilization is the most effective remedy. If spiritual mobilization organizations are universally developed in all groups, schools, families, and industrial and commercial service organizations, then not only can the above-mentioned life correction and thought correction be carried out through the form of organization, but all national salvation work can also be widely launched due to the strength of the organization.</p>
<h3>Anti-Comintern Pact to Expand into Alliance; Internal Conflicts in Japan; Possible Political Upheaval; Invasion of China at an Impasse; Arita Diplomacy at a Crossroads</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from here today, the German suggestion to expand the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, to confront the democratic front, has sparked fierce debate within political circles here. It may even develop into a political crisis within the cabinet. The Prime Minister, Minister of the Army, Minister of the Navy, and Minister of Finance have held several discussions on this issue this week. A major decision regarding Japan's policy may be made soon. The Japanese Diet is scheduled to close today, which is expected to accelerate the Japanese government's decision-making. With parliamentary questioning out of the way, the government can freely implement its preferred plans.</p>
<p>Currently, a majority of cabinet members in Japan seem to oppose getting involved in the European political vortex. However, they are also unwilling to abandon the possibility of an alliance with Germany without securing better terms elsewhere. It is noteworthy that the normally conservative "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" also published an unprecedented editorial yesterday, advocating for a "stronger agreement" with Germany and Italy. The reason Japan is hesitant to immediately form a military alliance with the Axis powers into an anti-democratic front is that Japan needs assistance from democratic countries for the "reconstruction of China".</p>
<p>It is reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has proposed a counter-proposal on this issue, namely that the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan should only apply to operations against the Soviet Union. However, some political circles here believe that Germany and Italy would not accept this counter-proposal. It is rumored that the Japanese ambassador to Germany, Oshima, has already reached an agreement with the German side on this issue. Therefore, if Japan rejects the German proposal, Oshima may resign. It is even possible that Foreign Minister Arita and Prime Minister Hiranuma will also resign. The Soviet, Italian, and German departments of the Japanese General Staff also advocate forming a broad alliance with Germany and Italy. However, Army Minister Itagaki seems to only advocate using this alliance from an anti-Soviet standpoint. The Japanese Navy opposes concluding a broad alliance with Germany and Italy because, according to the German proposal, if a war breaks out in Europe, the Japanese Navy would have to go to Europe without guaranteed compensation for damages. Although the German-Italian cultural agreement was signed this week, it is clear that the Japanese government is expressing indifference to the Berlin-Rome Axis, as Japan is well aware that Germany's demands exceed the rewards it is willing to offer. In the ongoing Japan-Germany trade negotiations, Germany not only refuses to adopt a barter system but also insists on cash payments, so the future of the negotiations is not smooth.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that the Japanese Foreign Minister believes that the best way to resolve Japan's current difficulties is to cooperate with Britain and the United States. Although there is no such possibility in sight, Arita believes that if a third country (mainly referring to Britain, the United States, etc.) can provide substantial rewards, Japan can open the Yangtze River for the access of third-country merchant ships. The opening of Qingdao is regarded here as a sign that Japan is shifting its stance, allowing it to turn towards Britain. According to those familiar with the political situation, if the United States helps Japan economically to complete the development of North China, Japan will abandon the proposal for an alliance with Germany and Italy. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(New York) Regarding the situation of the war between China and Japan, the Republican "New York Journal-American" recently commented, under the headline "Japan Has Almost Failed." It first stated that Japan's policy of conquering China by force has failed, and that it and Germany and Italy must feel frustrated as a result. Furthermore, the situation shows that the three countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, have not been able to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance treaty. "Regarding this matter, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita consulted Duke Saionji, an elder statesman of the country, and after discussions in the cabinet, a decision was finally made. The faction in Japan intending to conclude an alliance treaty with Germany and Italy, including personnel from the Navy and Army (who originally eagerly hoped to establish closer relations with various allied countries), had presented their proposals to the Emperor, but the Emperor, as usual, consulted the elder statesmen and was unable to get his wish. Although this resolution has failed, it should not be considered that the country's authorities no longer sympathize with the goals of Germany and Italy in Europe. It is only that Japan, in this global struggle, must wait until it is confident before allying with Germany and Italy and making a desperate gamble. As for whether German leader Hitler and Italian leader Mussolini can achieve victory, it is inherently uncertain, so it is reasonable for Japan not to hastily side with the losing side. However, the country's navy and army authorities are not yet willing to openly express such a view, in order to maintain their outwardly fierce but inwardly weak image," it said.

<h3>Japan Plans to Win Over Germany; Returning Qingdao as Bait; Also Returning the Mandated Caroline Islands to Germany; This Move Has Great Strategic Significance</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Unofficial political circles are now discussing the possibility of Japan returning Qingdao to Germany. Qingdao was occupied by Germany on November 14, 1897, due to the murder of two German missionaries. During the European War, Japan seized Qingdao from the Germans and returned it to China in 1922. Now it is back in Japanese hands, so there is talk of Qingdao being returned to Germany. However, many believe that there is a difficulty: the obstacle to Germany recovering Qingdao is that this move is incompatible with the carefully maintained Sino-German friendship. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The "News Chronicle" has learned that the Japanese government has proposed to Germany that it is willing to return the Caroline Islands in the Pacific to Germany, as a gesture of goodwill from Japan to Germany, and as an example for other countries occupying former German colonies. It is heard that this proposal is conditional on the Caroline Islands being returned to Japan after Germany recovers its former colonies from Britain and France. The Caroline Islands consist of 500 islands, located between the Philippine Islands and the Marshall Islands, with a land area of 380 square miles and a population of 40,000. The islands were first discovered by the Portuguese in 1537, and later purchased by Germany in 1899 for 25 million Portuguese pesos. In 1919, the League of Nations entrusted Japan with their administration. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Labor Party's "Daily Herald" recently reported that Berlin sources said yesterday that Japan intends to cede Jiaozhou Bay in China to Germany. "Although the area is a good base commercially, if Japan transfers it to Germany, the strategic significance will undoubtedly be greater than the economic significance." The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" stated that the Japanese government is rumored to have proposed to Germany that it is willing to return the Caroline Islands in the Pacific (currently administered by Japan) to Germany, in order to express goodwill and set an example for other countries to return old colonies. "But it is attached with a peculiar condition: that if Germany recovers its old colonies from Britain and France, it should still return the Caroline Islands to Japan," it said. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A British dispatch said that Germany hopes Japan will return Qingdao. Local people were very surprised when they heard this. It is thought that rumor-mongers want to stir up anti-German sentiment, so they made slanderous remarks. German officials said that they had not discussed the Qingdao incident with Japan, and even that the German authorities had not thought of this. (Haitong dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japan-Germany Trade Negotiations; Soon to Be Completed; Barter as the Principle</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that Japan and Germany will sign a new trade agreement based on barter at the end of May or the beginning of June. These negotiations can be completed in early June. Under the new conditions, German exports to Japan will be doubled compared to before, while Japanese goods exported to Germany will be three times as much as before. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Comintern Pact Transformed into Military Alliance; U.S. Has Not Received Formal Report</h3>
<p>Washington The State Department did not offer any official criticism yesterday regarding reports that Germany, Italy, and Japan are preparing to expand the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance to confront the united front of democratic nations proposed by Britain. However, State Department officials expressed their belief that this report is completely unfounded. They said that, according to their observations, the government has not received such a report.

<h3>Japanese Side; Morale Shaken</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Recently, some Japanese people have expressed doubts about the establishment of the puppet regime and made pronouncements. The Japanese side in Shanghai issued an order to various places on the 18th to prevent this. The content of the telegram roughly stated, "Since the incident, there are Japanese people who are taking advantage of the situation to engage in improper behavior, which may become an obstacle to the new regime. The Army Department should formulate measures to crack down on them," and the criteria for determining "improper behavior" include "those who use rumors and gossip to disturb people's hearts." This is enough to prove the state of shaken morale on the Japanese side. (Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Suiyuan Increases Troops in Baosuo</h3>
<p>Yu Ji: There are no major changes in the situation of the Japanese army in Suiyuan. However, in the past month, the puppet Mongolian army stationed in Baosuo counties has repeatedly shown anti-Japanese sentiments. The Japanese army is panicked and has transferred 2,000 infantry and cavalry from Zhangjiakou to guard Baosuo and closely monitor the situation. According to information gathered from various sources, the Japanese army's decision to increase troops in Baosuo is purely to prevent a counterattack by the puppet Mongolian army and has no intention of invading westward.

<h3>Soviet Union Fully Prepared to Deal with Japanese-German Threats</h3>
<p>Red Army Holds Large-Scale Maneuvers in the Western Border Region</p>
<p>New Railway Completed for Convenient Military Transportation</p>
<p>(London) The Times reports from Moscow that the Red Army has begun maneuvers throughout the western border region of the Soviet Union, from Leningrad to Belarus. The commander of the Kiev Military District, Timoshenko; the commander of the Belarus Military District, Gavrilov; and the commander of the Leningrad Military District, Meretskov, all returned to their respective defense areas from Moscow before the end of the Communist Party Congress in order to review the exercises. Defense Commissar Marshal Voroshilov arrived in Minsk today, and Marshal Budyonny has arrived in Leningrad. In the past few days, large-scale tests to resist aerial and gas attacks have been conducted in Minsk and other places. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to predictions made today by diplomatic and trade experts, due to recent developments in Europe, the Soviet Union will gain an important new position in Western Europe in times of emergency. Trade authorities here believe that trade agreements will be signed between Britain and the Soviet Union and between Britain and Poland after the Hudson trade delegation visits the Soviet Union and Poland. Neutral political observers here believe that Britain and France have indeed abandoned their views of underestimating the Soviet Union's power and prestige. They believe that the hope of a "contain Hitler" agreement between the four countries of Poland, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France is high. Some observers believe that the Soviet Union is fully prepared to prevent further German expansion eastward. They expect Hitler to take a short break after this victory and reorganize the territories he has acquired. Experts on Far Eastern affairs believe that the Soviet Union has shown confidence in dealing with the combined threats of Japan and Germany, as the Soviet Union believes that Japan's invasion of China has left it with no time to look elsewhere, so the threat is not very great. Recently, the Soviet Union completed the Trans-Siberian Railway between Ulan-Ude and Kyakhta on the Mongolian border. The newspapers did not give much publicity to this, but people here believe that this is extremely important. The railway is connected to the completed highway to Ulan Bator. Far Eastern experts believe that if war breaks out, this new railway will be of great strategic importance. They said that the Japanese have said that Vladivostok has 70 Soviet submarines and more than 50 powerful torpedo boats. In the summer of 1938, the Soviet Union built two new destroyers in Leningrad and then sent them to Vladivostok to reinforce the Far Eastern Red Army. The strength of the army there has been strengthened since the border conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan last year. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Germany Forms Huge Military Camp in Central Europe</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The unification of Germans scattered throughout Eastern and Southeastern Europe to form a federation has been a long-standing desire of the German people. After centuries of failure to achieve this, National Socialist Germany has now begun to realize it. The newspapers thus commonly refer to Führer Hitler as the "creator and expander of the German nation," truly the heir to the great emperors of the ancient Roman Holy Roman Empire. As the overall situation is trending in this direction, the countries in Eastern and Southeastern Europe whose territories border Germany and which have minority ethnic groups struggling to live within their borders, such as Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia, are under great threat and risk being controlled by Germany. As for how Germany is dealing with this trend, one only needs to look at the protection agreement concluded between the country and the Slovakian state and the supplementary commercial agreement concluded with Romania to see a glimpse. The intention of the German-Romanian agreement is to closely link the economic structure of the agricultural country with the German economic structure, so that Germany can form a huge iron factory and military camp in Central Europe, drawing the raw materials it needs from the neighboring agricultural countries. Speaking in terms of international politics, this also has significant causes and consequences. In essence, in order to prevent attacks from Britain and France, Germany still needs Italy's assistance, but it does not want Italy to start a war. Informed sources in the National Socialist Party believe that, with the current international transformation, a new migration movement has occurred among the peoples of Europe, and the German nation has abandoned its path of westward expansion and changed to eastward expansion. In the course of this eastward advance, although it has been obstructed by the conspiracies of various democratic countries, if a country like Poland can submit rationally, and the determination of the Soviet Union's fate is not far away.

<h3>Poland Advocates for Four-Power Military Cooperation</h3>
<p>Britain Must Bear Concrete Responsibilities; Rumors of Germany Increasing Troops on the Polish Border</p>
<p>(London) Polish Ambassador Raczynski visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon and discussed the results of the talks by cabinet members from Britain and France, but did not make any new suggestions regarding the issue of a collective security system for Eastern Europe. Regarding this matter, British Ambassador to Poland, Sir Kennard, is conducting talks with the Polish government. Everything must wait until Foreign Minister Beck visits Britain in early June before a decision can be made. According to reliable sources, the Polish government advocates that Britain, France, Poland, and the Soviet Union should immediately conduct talks on military issues before issuing a joint declaration or convening an international conference. As Germany has threatened Poland since reclaiming the Memel region and signing an agreement with the Slovakian state, it is eager to work with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to prevent Germany from continuing to advance eastward, but with the following four conditions: (1) The Soviet Union and Poland should formulate a plan for military cooperation; (2) The existing mutual assistance agreement between France and the Soviet Union should be amended in light of the changes in European territory; (3) The obligations accepted by Britain should be clearly stated; (4) The language of the joint declaration must be clear and specify various acts of aggression, so that the countries concerned can immediately implement mutual assistance in the event of such acts. If the above conditions can be realized, Poland can join the collective security plan for Eastern Europe proposed by Britain. In addition, there is a clause in the agreement signed between Germany and the Slovakian state that allows Germany to build military bases in the state's border area near Poland's military industrial center. Upon hearing this news, the Polish government intends to protest to Germany. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Warsaw It is rumored that Germany has increased the number of troops and strengthened defenses near the Polish border. Upon hearing the news, the Polish authorities have been closely monitoring the border area. In addition, disturbances have occurred recently in the province of Silesia, which is close to the German province. Unidentified people have posted swastika signs in various thoroughfares, and it is heard that German soldiers have attempted to invade the Polish city of Bogumin, resulting in a conflict, but this cannot be confirmed.

<h3>British Labour Leader Criticizes Government</h3>
<p>Repeated Policy Errors Plunge Nation into Crisis</p>
<p>(London) Opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee delivered a speech in Winsborough this afternoon, fiercely criticizing the government's current policy and saying that there was no room for discussion at this time for the Labour Party to join the cabinet. He said, "The government authorities, in the name of national unity, have called on the Labour Party to join the cabinet. Foreign Secretary Halifax even made a speech in the House of Lords on the 19th of this month, saying 'collective security.' The government admits failure, and there has never been such a thing. Five days before the Green Foreign Secretary spoke, Finance Minister Simon expressed opposition to the principle of collective security. The promises offered by the current cabinet at the beginning of its tenure were not made in good faith, and the admission of failure is clear evidence of this. The government authorities, while admitting that peace cannot be maintained unless the collective security system can be established, have, in practice, consistently opposed the establishment of a collective security system. As a result, the country has been plunged into a war crisis, the strength of democratic countries around the world has been weakened, and the confidence of the British people has been shaken. It is no wonder that a government that has failed so many times still hopes for the support of the people. As for calling on the Labour Party to join the cabinet, it is simply incredible."

Fortunately, King Victor Emmanuel III's edict read yesterday at the Fascist Corporate Council has greatly reassured the public. General opinion is also deeply impressed by recent events in Central Europe. Therefore, the Premier's speech tomorrow will undoubtedly attract worldwide attention. Moreover, the government's invitation to foreign envoys to attend the event further underscores the importance of this address. The Premier is expected to address Italy's various aspirations, seeking a clear explanation and firmly declaring Italy's commitment to peace. (Havas, 25th)</p>

Various budget bills including military expenses for the China war total 9.4 billion yen. The strong cooperation between the government and the Diet during this session is rare and has been one of the quietest in recent years. The Diet closing ceremony is scheduled for Sunday at the House of Peers. The Emperor will not attend the ceremony. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The 74th Diet, which is scheduled to adjourn today, has passed all budget bills for the next fiscal year starting April 1, totaling 9,409,541,000 yen, including the following items: (1) Basic recurring budget: 3,694,666,000 yen; (2) First supplementary budget, namely the army and navy rearmament plan: 910,543,000 yen; (3) Second supplementary budget, namely the expenses of various departments including the army and navy: 199,332,000 yen; (4) Special military expenses budget for the war in China: 4,605,000,000 yen. However, 435,186,000 yen from increased taxes has been designated for military use. Therefore, after deducting this amount, the next year's budget will be 8,874,355,000 yen.

<h3>Slovakia Accepts Hungarian Proposal</h3>
<p>To Organize Joint Committee for Boundary Negotiations</p>
<p>Bratislava City: After Slovak Foreign Minister Ďurčanský protested to the Hungarian government yesterday about the Hungarian army's intrusion into its territory, the Hungarian government immediately proposed the formation of a joint committee to delineate the border between the two sides. It is now known that the Slovak government has accepted this proposal, and its representatives are scheduled to travel to the Hungarian capital on the 27th of this month for negotiations. According to front-line news, the positions occupied by Hungarian troops and Slovak troops have stabilized and there have been no changes. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Romanian-Hungarian Discord</h3>
<p>Germany to Exert Pressure to Demobilize Hungarian Troops</p>
<p>German-Hungarian Economic Negotiations Underway</p>
<p>Bucharest: After Romania and Germany concluded a supplementary commercial agreement, official sources here generally said that Germany would soon pressure the Hungarian government to demobilize its troops. If Hungary cannot obtain German aid in spirit and in material, it will not be able to take any action against Romania and will inevitably accept German advice. However, whether Romania and Hungary will from now on dispel their suspicions and become friendly is still unknown. The reason why Romania decided to accept German demands and sign a commercial agreement with it was because it was concerned about the deployment of Hungarian troops on the border. The wounds are still fresh and it is difficult to forget quickly. On the other hand, Hungary's plan to recover Outer Transylvania originally had a glimmer of hope, but it was ultimately frustrated by the constraints of the situation and became a mere fantasy. However, it is conceivable that the hope is rising higher due to such stimulation. In short, Romania and Hungary could have laid the foundation for understanding after Hungary occupied Carpathian Ruthenia (Hungary had promised to return the areas inhabited by Romanian minorities in that province to Romania). However, in reality, they still clash with each other and give Germany the opportunity to manipulate them from the middle. Therefore, as far as the current situation is concerned, although there is no doubt that the Hungarian army will be demobilized, there is no hope that the situation in Europe will ease as a result. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: The Romanian government is negotiating with the Hungarian government on the demobilization of Hungarian troops through diplomatic channels, and before the negotiations achieve results, it will continue to take military measures in preparation for contingencies. Reserve soldiers in all parts of Outer Transylvania (which belonged to Hungary before the European War and now belongs to Romania) are enlisting enthusiastically, and some have volunteered before the call-up order was issued. However, Romania's selection of locations for border defense forces to be stationed are all at a considerable distance from the border line in order to avoid causing disputes. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to reliable sources, Germany and Hungary are conducting economic negotiations, and a commercial agreement is expected to be concluded in a short period of time. Its importance will at least be equal to the German-Romanian commercial supplementary agreement. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>German-Romanian Agreement Regarding Oil Section Does Not Hinder Anglo-French Rights</h3>
<p>Bucharest: After the German-Romanian commercial agreement was concluded, Romanian officials repeatedly consulted with the British Minister to Romania during the negotiations in the days before the final decision. It is reported that the British Minister advised the Romanian government to make some concessions in principle, and to try to remedy the situation during implementation, in order to avoid immediate disputes. At the same time, Britain is also willing to protect Romania's future and prevent it from suffering irreparable damage. According to the German-Romanian agreement, the companies jointly established by Germany and Romania are only limited to developing new oil wells. That is, the operations of the oil wells of the British, American and French companies have not been hindered, nor have they been restricted to selling oil to Germany. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The supplementary commercial agreement signed between Germany and Romania was recently commented on by responsible persons here, stating that the rights obtained by Germany in Romanian coal and oil are limited to undeveloped oil wells. France, according to the French-Romanian commercial agreement of 1935, the rights enjoyed by the existing coal and oil wells in Romania are not hindered. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: According to information gathered here, the economic agreement signed between Germany and Romania the day before yesterday has begun to be implemented. The first batch of military supplies has been shipped from Germany to Romania. The newspapers here today expressed satisfaction with this matter, believing that since German military supplies have been shipped, it must mean that Germany has no ambitions to invade Romania.

<h3>New German Financial Plan to Raise Funds for Military Expansion</h3>
<p>Issue Interest-Free "Tax Bonds"</p>
<p>Mandatory Subscription by National Business and Industry</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German government announced a new financial plan yesterday, stipulating the issuance of "tax vouchers" from May 1 this year to make up for extraordinary expenditures not covered by regular tax revenue. Financial Secretary Reinhardt specially hosted a press conference yesterday to explain the new plan, declaring that the government has decided to issue interest-free tax vouchers from May 1 this year. Those who have contracts with the national, provincial, municipal governments, as well as railway, highway and other public institutions, must accept 40 percent of the payment in tax vouchers when accepting any amount of payment. After acceptance, it can be transferred to industrialists for settlement. After accepting it, industrialists can transfer it to others or save it. Tax vouchers are divided into two types. The first type can be paid to the financial authorities at face value seven months after the date of issuance, or to pay the import tax. However, if the voucher holder saves it, the voucher holder can increase the total amount of tax vouchers held by 20 percent after ten months and include it as part of the depreciated assets on the annual statement. The result can reduce the tax by 10 percent of the face value of the tax voucher. If it is saved for another year, the percentage of tax reduction will be higher. The German Ministry of Finance stipulates this preferential method, hoping that the need for this tax voucher will be greater than the second type. The German government may not return the principal of the voucher until five years, ten years or even decades later. As for the amount not covered by the tax rate reduction, it shall be supplemented by increasing income tax, and administrative expenses shall be reduced to support it. The second type of tax voucher cannot enjoy the benefits of the first type of tax voucher and must be paid to the government to pay taxes at 112 percent of the face value 37 months after issuance. In other words, from the second year, the value of this tax voucher increases by 0.33 percent every month. This type of tax voucher can be mortgaged in banks, and banks can also buy or sell it. In short, the purpose of the first type of tax voucher is to absorb the floating funds in the economic organization, while the purpose of the second type of tax voucher is to absorb the funds outside the economic organization.</p>
<p>(Berlin) The government announced a new financial plan today, which will be implemented from May 1 this year. The focus is on the issuance of interest-free "tax vouchers", which are forced to be subscribed by industry and commerce, and used to prepay next year's taxes, and used as temporary expenditures for military expansion, and there is no need to use public bonds to raise funds. Deputy Minister of Finance Reinhardt issued a speech to explain it, saying that the tax revenue was 6.8 billion marks in 1933, and it has increased to 17.5 billion marks in 1938, which is still not enough to cover various temporary expenditures. However, using bond raising to raise funds will only increase the difficulty of the national treasury. This is why the government decided to issue interest-free tax vouchers. In the future, all goods purchased by the central government, local governments, railway companies, postal models, and other legal entities can be paid with this type of tax voucher for 40 percent of the selling price. This method applies not only to mainland Germany, but also to the province of Austria and the Sudeten area. Observers commented that there are two main points in this plan: (1) Tax vouchers are divided into two types: Type A, which starts to circulate seven months after issuance, and permanently circulate in the market, and does not return the principal, and can be used to pay taxes and tariffs, and those who store it for a longer period of time, until ten months later, will be given a "premium", which is especially allowed for export industries. All items of more than 500 marks can be paid with 40 percent of the total number of tax vouchers. Type B, which will not be used until three years after issuance, will have a premium of 12 percent. (2) An additional income tax is levied, and the increase in income since 1930 is used as the calculation standard, and this year, an increase of 35 percent is used as the calculation standard. Since Germany has actively expanded its military, millions of workers have obtained work as a result, and the purchasing power of the people has also increased accordingly. However, due to the increase in the production of armaments, other types of production have been reduced, and as a result, the people have obtained assets and have no way to spend them. The government authorities have set up an additional income tax to reduce purchasing power, thereby reducing the difference between production and purchasing power. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<h3>China Exchange Fund Bill Passes First Reading in British Upper House</h3>
<p>Labour Party Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>(London) The China Exchange Fund Bill was given its first reading in the House of Lords today and is scheduled for a second reading on February 27th. Labour MP Lawrence moved an amendment today before the third reading of the bill in the Lower House, seeking to delete the clause guaranteeing British banks 2.75% interest if the Chinese government fails to pay interest on the banks in China. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon said at the end of the debate that when the bill was given a second reading, the Lower House had clearly expressed its unanimous sentiment that Britain was now making a beneficial contribution for the true interests of peace and was providing assistance to those who deserved it. He had great confidence that if the Chinese government continued its highly honourable practice of striving to fulfil its obligations, the British government would not need to fulfil the guarantee on interest. The Labour Party amendment was subsequently rejected at the review committee. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Building Strong Military Works Around Shanghai</h3>
<p>Apparently Seeking to Take Advantage of Europe's Troubled Times to Eliminate Democratic Nations' Rights and Interests in Shanghai</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to well-informed sources, due to the grave situation in Europe, Japan is constructing solid military installations around Shanghai to nullify the defenses of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. Japan evidently intends to exploit the future outbreak of war in Europe to forcibly eliminate the political power of various democratic countries in Shanghai. New artillery emplacements in the Wusong and Doushan areas have been completed, making it absolutely impossible for foreign warships to pass through the Yangtze and Huangpu River estuaries. Moreover, the suburbs of Doushan and Wusong have become military strongholds, with entry and visits prohibited. Japanese military authorities have also completed four barracks near Shanghai, capable of housing 20,000 troops. Furthermore, "artillery outposts" have been built at various locations around Shanghai, such as the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, Liuhang, Yanghang, Hongqiao, etc. All these measures are aimed at encompassing the foreign concessions in Shanghai under Japanese military rule, turning Shanghai into a Japanese stronghold in the Far East.

<h3>Domestic and International Situations Increasingly Pressing, Hiranuma Cabinet's Future Dim</h3>
<p>War Expenditure Budget Already Exhausted</p>
<p>General Sentiment Eager to End the War</p>
<p>To speculate on the future of the Hiranuma Cabinet, one must first understand its nature. Recognizing the Hiranuma Cabinet can, as usual, be analyzed from both subjective strengths and objective circumstances. Simultaneously, one can make a comparative observation of the composition of the Hiranuma and Konoe Cabinets, even though the Hiranuma Cabinet is merely an extension of the Konoe Cabinet, or one could say the two are the same.</p>
<p>The Subjective Strengths of the Hiranuma Cabinet</p>
<p>Regarding subjective strengths, Japanese Diet member Kohno once made the sweeping assertion: "The Hiranuma Cabinet is the least popular cabinet in Japanese history." If we elaborate on this statement, then, first, Hiranuma Kiichirō himself has always been suspected by those responsible for recommending the Prime Minister and the elder statesmen and influential figures whose ideological form somewhat influences Japanese political trends; second, even the upper echelons of the financial world view him as a dangerous figure due to Hiranuma's usual high-profile advocacy of "innovation"; third, the Army and Navy Ministries do not show firm trust and ardent support for Hiranuma, so they presented seven conditions when he came to power; fourth, the political parties' antipathy towards the Hiranuma Cabinet has been fully expressed in the interpellations of the current Diet session, which need not be detailed further. The conditions of Prime Minister Hiranuma himself are like this, and the conditions of his cabinet members are even more base and clumsy. Among the cabinet members currently holding the most important positions in the Japanese cabinet, besides the two ministers of the Army and Navy, are the Ministers of Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and Finance. Kido, the Home Minister of the Hiranuma Cabinet, although said to be an old acquaintance of the Konoe Cabinet, is inferior to the indecisive Moto in terms of his decisiveness and backing. When he took office and made his opening remarks, he immediately declared the abandonment of the New Party movement, namely the National Reorganization movement, that he had previously been active in. His greatest role is only to mitigate the elder statesmen's hatred of Hiranuma. If Finance Minister Ishiwata is compared to Ikeda, he is simply a small sorcerer compared to a great one. He not only cannot represent the will of the financial world, but also handles the financial world clumsily. His financial policies are actually repeating the mistakes of Kaya. The tax increase policy that Ikeda did not adopt, Kaya is going to adopt on a large scale, turning a blind eye to the heavy burden on the Japanese people, especially the rural villages. We really don't know how this "financial artist" can avoid stumbling. Speaking of Foreign Minister Arita, his character is certainly the same as before, but the increasingly deteriorating environment has made the same person's mind even more confused. Furthermore, the newly appointed Minister of Agriculture Sakurai Takeo, Minister of Railways Maeda Yonezō, and Minister of Health Hirose are even more insignificant. Sakurai (of the Minseitō party) and Maeda (of the Seiyūkai party) are merely decorations of the political parties in the cabinet. As long as the name of Japanese parliamentary politics exists, one or two members of political parties must always be inserted in the Japanese cabinet. Their position as mere hangers-on has long been despised by Machida, the president of the Minseitō party. It is also conceivable that they cannot play any role between the cabinet and the political parties. As for Hirose, the Minister of Health, he is merely a side branch of Home Minister Kido. Initially, the Hiranuma cabinet had decided that Kido would concurrently hold the positions of Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Health. However, Kido's response on the phone was: "Concurrent duties are too burdensome, I really can't handle it. Please appoint Hirose, a bureaucrat, as Minister of Health." Hirose's role can also be imagined. The other cabinet members are all Konoe's "old people in old positions," so there is no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>The Objective Situation of the Hiranuma Cabinet</p>
<p>From the day it was born, the Hiranuma Cabinet, which had a third-stage tuberculosis, the biggest difficulty is still the harsh objective situation. Although the average Japanese person does not usually see Hiranuma as ordinary, most recognize Hiranuma as "an innovative politician who feels it is necessary to thoroughly reform the political, economic, and even educational systems for the rise of the Japanese Empire" (see "Today's Problems"). Therefore, there are still many people who expect the Hiranuma Cabinet to materialize, but today's environment is very different from the past. Whether Hiranuma's usual aspirations can be carried out at this time is a huge question. Discussing the "innovative political" ideology, Konoe's enthusiasm is certainly more intense than Hiranuma's. Konoe usually chanted his "innovation theory" as a noble, and after July of the previous year, he still did not forget about the revision of the House of Representatives election law, the reform of the House of Peers system, and even the revision of the universal civil service system. But what was the result? Everything remained the same. Even the New Party movement or the National Reorganization movement only became empty slogans. Although Konoe spent a lot of energy supporting the difficult situation for a year and a half, the result was only the titles of "Indecisive Courtyard" and "Mr. Conflict-Avoider" (as said by Lai Xian). Konoe's intelligence is actually higher than Hiranuma's. Before his resignation, he had made a major effort to explore the situation. He saw clearly that the domestic and international situations in Japan and the internal contradictions of the cabinet were not easy to overcome, so regardless of the elders, statesmen, and various parties' appeals to stay, he resolutely took the step of resigning, only agreeing to take on the idle position of Minister without Portfolio. Hiranuma took on the increasingly deteriorating situation at home and abroad in a hurry. It can almost be said that Hiranuma fully inherited the dregs of Konoe's cabinet members and the more intensified crisis. Even if he had three heads and six arms, it would be difficult to reverse the decline, let alone Hiranuma is also an extremely mediocre person. Currently, the most serious and most difficult problems in Japan are how to quickly end the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese war of aggression against China has been going on for nearly twenty months. The casualties of the army alone have reached more than 700,000. The mobilization of the army has reached the reserve army and the reserve army. The issue of troop types has actually been put on the agenda of the Japanese Diet. The consumption of material and financial resources is even greater. The source of Japanese finance has now been exhausted. This year's budget案 was particularly difficult to produce. In peacetime, it would have been basically prepared in July of the first year, and the final decision would have been required in February, but this year it has been delayed until now and has not yet been fully decided. The biggest reason is that the subsequent war expenses, namely the so-called special military budget, are difficult to determine. According to recent news, the total amount of the Japanese Army and Navy's temporary additional budget for this year (this item may be the special military budget) has reached 5.97 billion yen. This is 1.12 billion yen more than the total amount of the Army and Navy's temporary additional budget案 for last year, which was 4.85 billion yen. This amount was already considerable, but the expansion of subsequent military operations will make the actual use much greater than this number, and the source of this budget must rely on public debt (5.29 billion yen) and tax increases (纳 680 million yen), both of which are uncertain futures. In July, we will also need to prepare the budget案 for the next year. I don't know how the old man Hiranuma will deal with it.</p>
<p>The Application of Policies Has Reached a Dead End</p>
<p>Japan's policy towards China has been chaotic and has reached a stage where it cannot but be chaotic. As Seiyūkai Diet member Sekō Kōichi pointed out in this Diet session, Japan's "non-intervention policy towards China" is constantly changing. Recently, foreign news has reported that "The Japanese government has now taken a completely unexpected step to make peace with China. Japan has suggested to the Chinese side to organize a new government with Chairman Chiang as a senior official..." This is certainly Japan's deception and enticement, but the wavering of its policy towards China can be asserted. Japan's use of political offensives has almost completely failed. The issue of plagiarizing the Three Principles of the People and using cultural aggression has even been put on the agenda of the Japanese Diet. Its policy's having reached a dead end has been completely exposed, which is also the Hiranuma Cabinet's fatal wound. The second major difficulty facing the Japanese government is the problem of "friendly diplomacy," which is closely related to the war of aggression against China. The Japanese aggressors, who pride themselves on being a "super race" (as said by the former Japanese spy, the Italian Fan Si Pai), although dreaming of conquering China, Asia, and even the world, still need to reconcile their diplomatic relations with various countries due to environmental constraints. This responsibility was initially placed on Hirota's shoulders, but the result was that the more he tried to coordinate, the more uncoordinated he became. His successor, Utagaki, also ended up in a complete failure and fled in panic. Arita exposed his diplomatic incompetence in the Konoe Cabinet, and his current situation is a hundred times more difficult. Although the joint sanctions method of Britain, the United States, and France has not been fully launched, the recent tough stance and various measures of the bears have also given Foreign Minister Arita a headache. In addition, the development of the Soviet-Japanese fishing dispute in March and April will make Arita even more helpless than Utagaki. The Japanese army has neither the strength nor the determination to fight the Soviet Union, and the result will still be to submit to the Soviet Union, but the government must bear the blame for the responsibility.</p>
<p>Eager to End its War Against China</p>
<p>The Japanese military's recent response in the Diet has clearly revealed its weakness towards the Soviet Union. At the Berlin German-Italian-Japanese military-diplomatic joint conference, Germany and Italy also asked Japan to attack Britain, the United States, and France at the same time. The naval faction emphasized the thorough "punishment" of China for the sake of achievements and insisted on strengthening naval equipment. As a result, they brazenly occupied Hainan Island, one of Japan's two iron fists in the Pacific, creating the "September 18th Incident in the Pacific" and destroying the balance of power in the Pacific among Britain, the United States, France, and Japan. It is conceivable how the diplomatic relations between Japan and Britain, the United States, and France will become even more entangled after this. Due to the deterioration of international relations and the failure to end the war against China, the internal disputes caused by it, therefore, various internal contradictions are also the current major crisis of the Hiranuma Cabinet. The Hiranuma Cabinet, "the least popular in Japanese history," is indeed at a loss as to what to do with these contradictions. Hiranuma, who usually had grand dreams of greatly reforming Japan's political, economic, and educational systems, has also declared that the Hiranuma Cabinet will take the Konoe Cabinet's policy as its policy. However, as the Japanese commentator said, the Konoe Cabinet is an "Indecisive Courtyard," and Konoe is "Mr. Conflict-Avoider," then the trend of Hiranuma's domestic policy is completely known. Now, it is already afraid to mention the issue of the New Party movement of national reorganization. In the future, the long-pending issues of electoral system reform, House of Peers system reform, and even civil service system reform will not be dared to be touched. In this way, the future of Japan's political further fascistization, which Hiranuma subjectively desires, will not be able to advance a step, and the Hiranuma Cabinet will appear even more fragile. As for other issues such as material mobilization, spiritual mobilization, and various issues under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, all of which are closely related to the war of aggression against China, it is impossible to solve them satisfactorily in the near future. Now, for a larger war, it is not only the elder statesmen and senior officials who hold a cautious attitude, but also the upper financial circles who advocate a non-expansionist doctrine. Even among the military, there are people who advocate "knowing when to stop." Hiranuma's situation in the future is really very difficult: should he run wild with the young military officers? Japan's national strength really does not allow it, and most Japanese people outside the military閥 are also unlikely to agree. Should he implement his so-called "friendly policy"? The internal and external situation does not allow him to smoothly display his skills, let alone he has no skills at all. Such a weak cabinet, a "nominal" cabinet, will either be reorganized or resign en masse in the near future. No wonder Kohno asked Hiranuma: "Expeditiously reorganize the cabinet and recruit new people," and Hiranuma could only respond with a wry smile.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Inspects Eastern Battlefield, Deploys Zhejiang Eastern Defenses</h3>
<p>Thorough Deployment Along Both Sides of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Reinforcement Troops Begin General Offensive</p>
<p>Japanese Motorboats Head South, Attempting to Land Again</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the National Government's Military Commission, was ordered to inspect the Eastern Battlefield. Due to the tense situation in Eastern Zhejiang, he advanced his inspection of various locations in Eastern Zhejiang. Together with Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the ×th War Zone, and Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, he held a military conference in a certain location in Eastern Zhejiang, and instructed on the coastal and river defenses of Eastern Zhejiang. It is reported that it was stipulated that the area along the Qiantang River would be the responsibility of Huang Shaoxiong's troops, and the area along the Fuchun River would be the responsibility of Liu Jianxu, Commander-in-Chief of the ×th Army Group, as ordered by Gu Zhutong. Now all deployments have been completed, are exceptionally solid, and martial law has been implemented.</p>
<p>Reinforcement Troops Arrive at Destination</p>
<p>The Japanese troops who secretly crossed the Fuchun River and landed have retreated to Lingjiaqiao and other places after being severely attacked by the garrison. A certain reinforcement unit dispatched by the ×th Army Group has arrived at its designated destination and is launching a general offensive against the Japanese troops. According to a traveler from Zhaojiacun, Fuyang County, across the Fuchun River, who came to Shanghai yesterday, the area belongs to the war zone and is garrisoned by a large army. All residents must have a certificate marked on their chest. The Japanese troops who secretly crossed the Fuchun River this time are only seven li away from Zhaojiacun.</p>
<p>One Hundred Japanese Motorboats Head South from Shanghai</p>
<p>The Ta Lu Pao reported that a foreign ship captain arrived in Shanghai last night (24th) and said that he had seen one hundred Japanese motorboats speeding south from Wusong towards Hangzhou Bay. It is estimated that the Japanese troops will attempt to land on the coast of Zhejiang Province. The type of motorboat is used by the Japanese Marine Corps. According to people from Ningbo, Japanese warships bombarded the Zhenhai Fort again on Thursday morning, and the defending troops also returned fire. The Japanese troops did not attempt to land. It is reported that the Izumo warship was among the Japanese warships that continuously bombarded the area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a Japanese warship was discovered on the Xizawa waters of Xiangshan Port, seemingly passing by. It is reported that the number of Japanese warships in the waters of Eastern Zhejiang has increased to more than ten.</p>
<p>Shipping in Eastern Zhejiang Vigorously Maintained</p>
<p>In recent days, the coast of Eastern Zhejiang has been repeatedly harassed by Japanese warships, which has led to frequent threats of disruption to the shipping traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang. According to inquiries from the shipping industry, our military defenses in Eastern Zhejiang are extremely solid. At the same time, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places have significant implications for Shanghai's transportation of goods and materials, and are greatly related to the economic life of the people. Therefore, within the realm of possibility, we must strive to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang. However, the ban on strong men accompanying the ships from Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places is stricter than before. Women and the elderly can purchase tickets and accompany the ships after obtaining an export permit from the county government. Yesterday, the Far East Company's Hana輪 departed from Ningbo, transited to Dinghai, and sailed to Shanghai, arriving at the port this morning. There were still many passengers, and the goods and local products loaded were also very prosperous. The ship is scheduled to sail straight to Ningbo at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The Zhongyi Company's Deping 輪 and the Huamei Company's Tangsai 輪 are both scheduled to depart for Ningbo on the 27th. The Meili Company's Meida 輪 and the Huamei Company's Tangbei 輪 are scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Wenzhou on the 27th and 28th, respectively. Passenger tickets have been sold at the respective companies, and cargo loading is being arranged.</p>
<h3>Japanese Silk Factory in Wuxi Torched by Guerrillas</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Wuxi is a region with a developed silk industry. Since its fall, the Japanese have monopolized the county's silk industry and formed the Huiming Company, merging the original Zhenyi, Anyu, Hefeng, and other silk factories. In just a few months last year, the company made a huge profit of more than two million yuan, all of which was plundered from the blood and sweat of silkworm farmers. Yu, the leader of the 3rd Brigade of the 10th Detachment of the Righteous Army in the county, led his troops to surround the Zhenyi Silk Factory, located at Yangyaowan outside the South Gate, and set it on fire in the early morning of the 23rd. For a time, the raging fire filled the sky. The guerrillas retreated after completing their mission. By the time the Japanese troops learned of the incident and rushed to the scene, they had cut off traffic and carried out searches of pedestrians, but found nothing.</p>
<h3>Owner of Jiaxing Theater Shot and Killed by Patriots</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: Guerrillas are quite active in Jiaxing City. The Wangwu Bridge area is a place where Japanese merchants gather, and Japanese shops are lined up, but there are even more Chinese slogans posted. Wei Jüzhen, the owner of the Jiyuan Theater inside the North Gate, relied on the support of the Japanese when they occupied Jiaxing and staged so-called Sino-Japanese friendship dramas to numb the Chinese people. At about 10:00 PM last night, Wei was returning home from the theater when two young patriots wearing black clothes suddenly jumped out at the entrance of Zhangjia Lane and fired fiercely at Wei. Wei immediately fell to the ground in extreme pain and soon died. The puppet police rushed to the scene after hearing the gunshots, but the murderers had already escaped. Wei was hit by four bullets, two in the chest, one in the right arm, and one in the head. After the case occurred, all the Japanese troops were dispatched to carry out a large search of shops and residences in the area around the Hai'er Bridge and Pusa Bridge, but found nothing.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Shops Continue to Buy, Cash Price Rises Only Slightly</h3>
<p>Daily Fluctuation Range Extremely Narrow</p>
<p>Transactions Also Extremely Scarce</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cash 烚赤 (roasted raw gold) market was quiet and dull, with no highlights. Transactions were also mediocre and uninteresting. The price was quite stable due to securities firms and gold shops buying, hovering between 2,080 yuan and 82 yuan throughout the day. As a result, it continued to rise by 3 yuan and 5 jiao. People's minds were calm, and transactions were not active, with a total of about 350 taels in the morning and afternoon. Silver shop jewelry gold remained unchanged, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also remained stable.</p>
<h3>Roasted Raw Gold Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Since the morning, because news said that the foreign exchange momentum was slightly soft, sellers were quite rare, so it took a long time to open. Until 10:05, the first transaction was seen when a money exchange firm entered 50 taels of cash gold at 2,085 yuan, which was 3 yuan and 5 jiao higher than the previous day's closing price. It was heard that a securities firm entered 50 taels of gold at 84 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange firms also mutually traded 50 taels at the same price. After this, supply and demand became scarce, and the price rarely changed. Around 11:00, because the foreign exchange situation turned flat, the sellers' willingness to supply was slightly stronger, but the buyers were all watching from the sidelines at that time, so the price slightly weakened. A silver shop gave a money exchange firm 50 taels at 82 yuan. It was already 11:20. After this, the general members left early because there was no supply and demand, so the afternoon closing price was still 82 yuan. The afternoon opening was still quiet. Around 2:30, a certain gold shop suddenly had a buying mood, and the price repeated its upward trend. It first entered 50 taels with a money exchange firm at 82 yuan, then entered 50 taels of cash with a gold shop at 83 yuan, and then entered 50 taels with a money exchange firm at 85 yuan. After this, it still wanted to buy, but the sellers had to supply at 87 yuan, so it was difficult to open. Therefore, the evening closing price was 2,085 yuan, which was 3 yuan and 5 jiao higher than the previous closing price. The whole day was only a 3-yuan difference. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand gold was 2,095 yuan, and the buying price was 2,085 yuan.

A certain bank's American exchange rate was 16 yuan 09375, and also purchased and settled HSBC Hua. A certain bank's British exchange rate was 8办士2.5. When HSBC's listed price was announced, it did not move. The white silver equilibrium tax also did not rise or fall, and remained slightly at 5.00%. After this, Chinese speculators suddenly came to sell American gold notes, but the foreign firms' appetite was quite good, so it was not affected. Chinese merchants sold American gold notes to Datong. A certain bank's American gold notes were at 16 yuan 1875.

<h3>Securities: Bulls Habitually Spread Rumors; Government Bonds' Rise is Fleeting</h3>
<p>If the government wants to buy government bonds,</p>
<p>Will it issue a large amount of banknotes?</p>
<p>Securities Market Intelligence: Yesterday's market conditions were such that, because the European situation seemed to be coming to an end, and the new regulations on collecting banknotes, as reported by this newspaper earlier, had also been confirmed, the market sentiment, which had been weak for several days, immediately rebounded. This was within the expectations of this newspaper. However, because it was Saturday, and because of profit-taking by speculators and the upcoming weekend holiday, the bullish side was not very enthusiastic, and the market's sharp rise stabilized quickly. There should be further changes next week. Yesterday, the market opened half a yuan higher in the morning. Tiansheng, Lianhe, Hengfu, and retail investors all absorbed the bonds. Tongkang continued to sell. Tongshun, Shunheng, Guangfeng, and Yongjun all released bonds. Thirty-eighth also secretly sold. However, because of strong absorption by retail investors, the market price rose by 57 cents in the morning. In the afternoon, retail investors continued to buy. Maoyi and Shuifeng also bought actively, and the market price continued to rise slightly. Then, due to selling by speculators, Tongkang and Thirty-fifth both sold, and the trend was slightly frustrated. In the end, the price generally rebounded by 45 to 60 cents. There were no transactions in the afternoon. The total volume was about 600,000 yuan. As for the rumor that a certain place was buying bonds, it is ridiculous. The government is issuing government bonds, why would it absorb them? If the government buys government bonds, banknotes will inevitably flow out, and the result will inevitably be an increase in the monetary supply. It is unlikely that the government would take such a step. Therefore, it is clear that the bulls are using newspapers to spread rumors to deceive the ignorant. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category	 	Highest	 	Lowest	 	Closing	 	Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A		570	 	5765	 	5765	 	Up 0.45</p>
<p>Unified B		5190	 	5150	 	5170	 	Up 0.50</p>
<p>Unified C		5170	 	5120	 	5135	 	Up 0.55</p>
<p>Unified D		5030	 	5020	 	5030	 	Up 0.65</p>
<p>Unified E		060	 	5035	 	5035	 	Up 0.75</p>
<p>96		660	 	——	 	660	 	Level</p>

<h3>Grain: Foreign Flour Pours In; Local Flour Offerings Loosen Again; Factories Prepare Bags to Load Wheat</h3>
<p>The spot market for flour is weakening again. It is found that local demand was not very active due to the weekend. After the Beiyang group offered a special price for a batch, there were no consecutive full-batch transactions. The Nanyang group also temporarily had no full-volume transactions due to unsuccessful price negotiations. Furthermore, it is said that a new ship of American "Flag" brand flour has arrived, and brands such as Jinma and Shuangying are standard No. 2 foreign flour, which is being sold in the market. It is said that the spot price is only 4.3 to 4.28 yuan, and some of the clients have also shifted to foreign flour. Yesterday, it was heard that several thousand bags had been traded in Qinhuangdao and other places in the Beiyang area. The local flour market has been greatly impacted, so it is said that the No. 2 flour factory's offering has fallen from 4.6 yuan to 4.55 yuan. If there is a large demand, the special price of 4.5 yuan can still be negotiated, but it has not been officially announced on the surface, and will be waited for at the beginning of the week. It is found that 66,500 bags of flour have been exported to Tianjin, and another 11,000 bags have been exported to Shantou.</p>
<p>The wheat market has also turned into a stable and secretly loose situation. Due to the recent dumping of foreign flour, the local flour market price has repeatedly declined slightly, and the raw material market is inevitably affected. However, at the moment when local wheat arrivals and inventories are both scarce, the street has no special major impact. Yesterday, it was heard that the Fuxin and Fufeng factories purchased 210,000 sacks to prepare for loading wheat. It is said that loose cargo of foreign wheat will arrive soon, and some say they are preparing for the new wheat season. As for local wheat trading, it is again at a standstill.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice Market Continues to be Small; Foreign Rice Falls in Price and Sales Increase</h3>
<p>As for the source of japonica rice, a total of 1,000 to 2,000 bags of "Car Comes Bag" rice arrived at the river docks. The local streets and hoarding households initially had some activity in the sales market, but in the end, due to strict price limits, people's hearts turned weak and suddenly became stagnant. Most of the goods could not be opened up, and it was difficult for the market to stand on its own feet, showing a downward trend. As a result, the price of thick and thin japonica rice fell by 10 to 20 cents, and Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian followed suit by a similar amount. The price of Luan Yuan rice was high, and the source of Yin Yuan rice gradually increased, so sales became sluggish and the price dropped by 30 cents, while Yin Yuan rice depreciated slightly by 10 cents. 客秈 traders continued to sell off, but the local street digestion was very sluggish, and the market continued to be small by 10 to 20 cents. Gao Wu 秈 rice had a price of 12.7 yuan, while medium grade rice ranged from 12.45 yuan to 12 yuan. However, after the price fell, both local retailers and the Nanyang group purchased some, and the market has been stabilized. The total market transaction was still less than 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>The number one Saigon, has insisted on above 17 yuan for several days, but the transaction has decreased. Due to the decline in the selling price of various 秈 rices by the clients, for example, Nanjing 蕪芜湖秈 has gradually fallen from the highest price of more than 13.5 yuan to 12.78 yuan, while the decline in foreign rice is very small, which is why importers are watching. Yesterday, the market price once reached 16.8 yuan including fees for disposal, and retail sales were slightly more active. As for the Department of Works' short-weighted original bags, 2,000 bags were also sold in batches, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Sales Are Not Very Prosperous; Spot and Warehouse Receipts Are Close; Price Difference is Only One Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the downtrend has not stopped. Because the goods in the hands of general importers, seeing the bad environment, and the goods accumulated in the financial community, are also trying to sell off, the market atmosphere is becoming increasingly lazy. At the same time, the actual needs of the clients are still stagnant and uninspired. As a result, the market outlook is even more scattered and weak. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 381 yuan. Subsequently, due to fear in people's hearts, it was sold down to the 380 yuan mark, with the lowest price being 377 yuan. However, in the past two days, it has fallen sharply by more than 10 yuan. Zhejiang East is still peaceful, and the Wenzhou-Taizhou clients' yarn and thread are still being shipped as usual. What the future holds depends on the amount of actual needs. The situation stabilized slightly in the afternoon, but business was still sluggish.</p>
<p>As for the situation of spot yarn, at the beginning of the morning, colleagues gathered together to watch and were lifeless. It was not until 10:15 AM that the market price slightly opened. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma warehouse receipt was 380 yuan, which was imported by a colleague with 75 bales. Subsequently, because the business of the clients was still not active, and the sellers were concentrated in the market, the asking price gradually declined. The initial price of the spot was 381 yuan, and the lowest price was 377 yuan. This opening price was down by 4 yuan. However, the price of the warehouse receipt was slightly higher, at 376 yuan, only one yuan apart. Because the sales of spot goods are lacking, and the Guang Fang催 out, if not turned over to the East, it must be sold at the market price. The warehouse receipt still has time to slow down. The opening was flat in the afternoon, but market transactions were still rare. It is found that the total amount sold by various clients throughout the day was 1,125 bales, and the market price was 20 wens per piece. The yarn price was 比上日 四五, Tiannv fell by 3.5 yuan, and Te Jin Cheng fell by 4 yuan. The factory opened 150 bales of 10-count Feihu yarn from the Anda Factory at a price of 290 yuan. Today, 510 pieces of yarn were shipped to Shantou, 100 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 190 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 8615 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. The amount purchased by various clients is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Colleagues	525	Wenzhou	40</p>
<p>Fujian	80	Shantou	140</p>
<p>Inland	160	Yunnan	175</p>
<p>Quanzhou	5	Statistics	1,125</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is still lifeless, and actual sales are still sluggish. However, the situation for the next month is relatively high, because the major players are all in a bullish position. The spot yarn price of 20-count Shuiyue is 339 yuan, and the spot yarn price of 20-count Lanfeng is usually around 330 yuan, which is about the same as the previous day.</p>

<h3>Wharf Warehouse Fire, Three Thousand Pieces of Indian Cotton Burned</h3>
<p>As for the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market is very weak. Southern merchants are selling off fiercely. The Cotton Committee of the US Department of Agriculture will hold a meeting next week to discuss Smith's proposal and the issue of subsidies for cotton export loans. All colleagues are taking a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for Washington's solution, as a basis for the rise and fall of American cotton prices.

It is estimated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 30 cents per lot, Indian cotton fell by cents, and Egyptian cotton rose by 20 cents.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous decline in yarn prices in the Shanghai foreign cotton market, factories have no intention of purchasing raw cotton, so foreign cotton transactions are extremely deserted. However, the Shenxin Factory opened 2,000 bales of Shuangma a few days ago. Yesterday, it replenished 2,000 pieces of 20-count raw cotton Indian cotton Bai Luoqu. Hongzhang entered 300 bales of Bai Luoqu. Other factories had no transactions. Japanese factories have not opened for purchase for many days.

<p>The local cotton business turned quiet, because yarn sellers had no intention of purchasing raw materials, so transactions in various places suddenly became scattered. The market price took the hit, but the inventory base was thin, coupled with the bleak source, the market price remained unchanged, without much difference from the previous day. As for the source of Northern Jiangsu, a total of 432 bales of Tongzhou flowers were counted. The current situation of spot cotton is listed below:</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Foreign Merchants' Raw Peanuts; Price of Qingdao Products is Limited</h3>
<p>"12.8 Yuan... Only Allowed to Fall, Not Allowed to Rise"</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Lun Chang Linen; Consigned Empty by Local Street Daily</h3>
<p>"Eastern Piece Goods Directly Shipped and Sold to Guerilla Areas"</p>
<p>The market price of domestic plain cloth continued to weaken, because Hua yarn fell sharply, and actual sales by Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants were affected by the military situation, and suddenly became bleak. Furthermore, the Shanghai-Ningbo exchange rate recently surged to 1,062 yuan, making it even more difficult to remit funds from both sides. However, although Hua yarn fell, Japanese yarn still stood firm. The cost of cloth did not decrease, and the selling price of Japanese cloth was firm. The decline of Zheng Tuan cloth was also缓和, with each piece continuing to fall by 5 cents. The most vibrant actual sales were in the local street and Guangdong gangs.

However, fabrics from the Yihua and Lun Chang factories, which are products of British merchants, are still allowed to be shipped.</p>
<p>The Eastern cloth market atmosphere is firm and high. Because the dyeing and sales of thin twill are becoming more and more prosperous, there is a shortage of spot goods, and they continue to rise. In addition to raising the price of Longtou twill by 10 cents per piece, Jiangshang 洋行 opened next month's futures of Longtou thin twill at 12.05 yuan, and Wufu thin twill at 11.9 yuan, but the amount was not large, only 100 plus loads. Local street and Qingdao gangs purchased about 800 plus pieces of thin cloth and thin twill. The stock in hand by the same industry is very thin at the moment, and Japanese merchants are tightening the market, and it is heard that they are directly shipping and selling to guerilla areas, so the local goods base in Shanghai is gradually decreasing, and people's hearts are firmer.</p>

It is found that the total market inventory is only dozens of loads.</p>

Soon, the telegram rose, and the market saw more demand than supply, so the price reversed and rose. The price jumped suddenly, just like the scene of the stock exchange market. As a result, it was consistently轧升 by 10 to 20 cents. It is estimated that 50 pieces of Kai Yanqi oil were properly opened (price details in market price　), 90 pieces of Lianqi oil, and 80 pieces of 六. 100 plus barrels of spot Dalian oil, 500 barrels for delivery in April, and 200 barrels for delivery in May.</p>

<h3>Fengyang Maru Sunk by Chinese Army En Route to Hankou</h3>
<p>"The ship was full of food and fodder</p>
<p>Losses exceeded one million yuan"</p>
<p>Xiandai News Agency reports that, according to news from foreign shipping circles, the Japanese Nissin Company's Yangtze River liner Fengyang Maru, with a deadweight of more than 1,000 tons, was requisitioned by the Japanese military authorities and converted into a transport ship for transporting military supplies and food.

Two bombs hit its head, destroying the front half, and the whole ship immediately flooded and sank quickly. None of the personnel on board were rescued. The Daji Maru sped to Hankou and escaped safely. The Japanese warship was also unharmed. In addition to Japanese personnel, the Fengyang Maru's sailors, drivers, stokers, etc., were all Chinese. Their families in Shanghai have all been informed of the disaster and are negotiating with the person in charge of recruiting these Chinese workers in the hope of obtaining compensation.

<p>Activities Also Reported in the Beixinjing Area</p>
<p>Japanese Transport Station Attacked in Tushanwan</p>
<p>Heavy gunfire was heard in the Zhabei Baoshan Road area last night (the 24th). According to Japanese sources, a Chinese plainclothes unit attempted to attack the Zhabei Political Affairs Office but was "bravely repelled" by Japanese troops. This indicates that our guerrilla forces are actively operating in the Zhabei area and have already controlled various key transportation lines, waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>Martial Law Imposed by Japanese Troops</p>
<p>Guerrilla forces have been very active in the western Shanghai area in recent days, especially along the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. According to sources in the transportation sector, yesterday a car from Qingpu to Shanghai was attacked by guerrilla forces, leading to the suspension of bus services between Shanghai and Qingpu.

The Li unit calmly responded to the attack. The Japanese troops repeatedly tried to land but were repelled each time. The confrontation lasted until dusk, when the Japanese troops, unable to sustain the effort, collapsed and retreated, leaving more than sixty bodies along the shore and suffering heavy casualties. The area is currently still firmly held by the Li unit.</p>
<p>Attack on Tushanwan</p>
<p>Tushanwan on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is the Japanese army's main transportation station, from which all the food and ammunition needed by the Japanese army in southern Jiangsu are shipped. It is the lifeline of the Japanese army in the region. The station was suddenly attacked the night before last (the 23rd) by the Xu Xingzhou unit of the Third Regiment of the Jiangsu Security Force. From dusk till dawn, fierce fighting lasted for four hours. Japanese troops launched several assaults but failed to achieve victory, while the Xu unit fought with increasing valor and irresistible force. Several Japanese soldiers were killed in close combat, and one of the Xu unit's company commanders was wounded. The unit seized several bags of Japanese provisions before retreating to its original position.</p>
<h3>Smuggling of Banned Goods</h3>
<p>Attempting to Evade Foreign Exchange Controls</p>
<p>And Suspected of Aiding Japan</p>
<p>The Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance has received reports that a small number of merchants are still smuggling goods subject to foreign exchange settlement and banned export goods out of the country, attempting to evade foreign exchange controls and are suspected of aiding Japan. To prevent this malpractice, it has sent separate letters to customs offices in Zhejiang and other coastal areas, as well as the Ningbo Import and Export Goods Inspection Office and county governments along the coast and rivers, instructing their subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit it. The Jianghai Customs has resumed operations.</p>

<h3>Japanese Shipping Company Pier and Warehouse Consumed by Fire</h3>
<p>Estimated Losses of 200,000 to 300,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Buildings Also Heavily Damaged</p>
<p>Japanese Authorities Still Investigating the Cause of the Fire</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, the wharf warehouse of the Japanese shipping company on Huangpu Road caught fire last night (the 24th). The buildings of the police station of the Japanese Consulate General were destroyed, and some important buildings of the consulate were also damaged. This is the largest fire seen since the great fire of 1937.</p>
<p>The fire started at 11:20 p.m. and the flames raged until 2:30 a.m. this morning. A large amount of cotton, wood, and other flammable goods stored in the warehouse were completely consumed by the fire. As of the time the Continental News went to print, the extent of the damage to the consulate buildings was not yet certain, but it is estimated that the losses are quite significant. Nine fire engines from the Public Concession Fire Brigade were dispatched to put out the fire, and the Japanese side also urgently dispatched four fire engines to the scene to assist in controlling the fire. A fireboat was also moored alongside in the river. Shortly after midnight, heavy snow began to fall. At the time, the Japanese authorities opened the doors of the consulate's prison cells and evacuated about sixty prisoners.</p>
<p>To Hongkou</p>
<p>Other buildings. Shortly before midnight, as the flames were raging, the scene was set in motion. Japanese troops, including Japanese naval and army soldiers, suddenly arrived in the area, entering the consulate buildings, carrying out official documents and ledgers. There was also a truck carrying forty barrels of gasoline stored in the consulate buildings, which were transported to a safe place. A Japanese shipping vessel of the Japanese shipping company happened to be berthed in front of the wharf directly opposite the burning warehouse. Because the flames were so long, it had to lift anchor and sail elsewhere. A patrolman of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces first saw the fire at 11:20 and immediately sounded the alarm. Although there was light rain, the fire was not affected at all. The Public Concession Fire Brigade arrived on the scene a few minutes later, but the flames had already spread rapidly inside this stele wall wood frame warehouse. Shortly after midnight, the wind became strong, hindering the work of the firefighters. At nearly 1:00 a.m., about twenty fire hydrants had gradually brought the fire under control. After midnight, a large number of Jewish refugees returning to their residences in Huishan and some curious residents</p>
<p>Gathered to Watch the Fire</p>
<p>Reached 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Japanese Consul General Miura and the police chief of the consulate also arrived on the scene to direct the personnel of the consulate. A moment after 1:10, Japanese Consul Sato moved the photographs of the Japanese Emperor and Empress from the Consulate General to the Japanese Central Elementary School on Bazilu. The Japanese authorities are currently investigating whether the fire was caused by arson. Also, a report in the North China Daily News stated that at 1:30 this morning, the post office of the Japanese shipping company also caught fire and burned. The wind caused the flames to extend to the riverside. Firefighters tried their best to protect</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>The houses. The ships in front of the nearby wharves were untied and moved elsewhere to avoid being affected. The fireboat was moored alongside to deal with any fires that might be caused by flying sparks. The house may collapse on Wuchang Road and the Yushun Wharf. This seems to be the main danger. The fire in the consulate was quickly extinguished, but as the North China Daily News was about to go to press, a fire broke out again in the consulate. The firefighters tried their best to save it. At 1:30, the huge cracking sound of tiles continuing to collapse was still heard along the Bund. Also, the English Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that as of the time the Greater Shanghai Evening Post went to press, two fireboats and two fire engines were still watering the embers of the Japanese shipping company's warehouse and part of the company's office next to the Japanese Consulate General. Inside the smoky rubble pile</p>
<p>Explosions Occurred</p>
<p>Because there were bottled beers in the warehouse that exploded due to heat. Firefighters were very careful when watering because there was a risk of bricks falling down. The warehouse walls will inevitably collapse and must be completely rebuilt.</p>
<h3>"Anti-Japanese National Reconstruction Association" Establishes National Reconstruction Army, Declares Recruitment of Patriotic Volunteers from Occupied Areas with Guerrilla Warfare as the Highest Task</h3>
<p>According to a visitor from a certain place yesterday, since the central government decided on a long-term war of resistance and launched guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, many patriotic volunteers in the occupied areas have spontaneously armed themselves and joined the anti-Japanese front. For example, the Anti-Japanese National Reconstruction Association recently established the National Anti-Japanese National Reconstruction Army in a certain place, and its strength is extremely strong. The visitor also brought a copy of the declaration, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Incident, the Japanese warlords have invaded westward in full force. The Chinese nation, with heroic posture, rose up to resist. Bloody battles in Shanghai, the Xuzhou campaign, the Taierzhuang encirclement, and the Wuhan demonstration displayed the roar of the nation, inflicted heavy blows on the enemy, focused international attention, and advocated world justice. Our central government led the entire nation to fight for the country, for ten years, annihilating nearly a million enemies. Although in the first phase of the war, our army's key transportation points and lines had to be strategically abandoned after exacting a heavy price from the enemy, although our central government had to shift its focus westward due to factual demands, and although the local governments in the occupied areas had to adapt to local conditions due to environmental factors, the entire war of resistance military and determination have not only not been shaken in the slightest, but the arrangements for the occupied areas have become even more precise, and the widespread guerrilla warfare has been actively launched to coordinate with the frontal war of resistance, adhering to the belief that the war of resistance will surely be victorious, and initiating the foundation for the revival of the nation. However, enemy cavalry is rampant in the coastal provinces, and the central and local authorities in the occupied areas, both north and south, consider all aspects and take care of them, which is beyond discussion. Within the occupied areas, there are many patriotic volunteers and revolutionary masses who have risen up in arms and generously devoted themselves to the cause. Moreover, the supreme leader proclaimed to us that the victory of China's war of resistance lies in the blood of the people deep in the interior. The establishment of this association is the only alliance of revolutionary comrades in the occupied areas, adhering to the Three People's Principles as the highest principle of national reconstruction, and implementing the instructions of the supreme leader to mobilize the masses to arm themselves for the war of resistance. Therefore, the National Anti-Japanese National Reconstruction Army is established, with its headquarters in a certain place, to concentrate, train, and unify the organization of all the vast armed anti-Japanese forces, cultivate them into elite troops, and assist the national army in jointly destroying the powerful enemy. After the establishment of this army, arming the masses and guerrilla warfare will be the highest and supreme task, and the spirit of perseverance and sacrifice will be used to fight for the liberation of the nation, without fear, without retreat, without regard to merits, and without distinction of boundaries. All patriotic people and revolutionary fighters are sincerely welcomed by this army and are willing to join hands and move forward, enrich the anti-Japanese front, and bravely attack the enemy. All the established national policies of the central government and the measures of local governments are what this army is willing to abide by and accept. Moreover, this army is composed of armed masses, and it deeply feels and suffers all the pain of the people. It deeply resents the enemy's evil deeds. It is determined to uphold the friendship of defending the country and completely eliminate it. Following this bravely and without hesitation, until the enemy's army collapses and justice is served, then the mission borne by this army will be completed with the completion of the central government's national policy of resisting Japan and building the country. At the beginning of the army's establishment, I humbly state this, wishing to encourage the people of the country together.</p>
<h3>Swiss Chargé d'Affaires Travels to North China for Vacation</h3>

<h3>Japanese Side Deliberately Creates Difficulties: Dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Believing the Council is Protesting to the Diplomatic Body</p>
<p>With "Unfriendly" Procedures</p>
<p>Japanese Consul General Also Has a Protest Letter</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, when the Japanese side received reporters from various newspapers last night (the 24th), it issued a protest letter from the Japanese Consul General, stating that the Municipal Council's act of protesting to the diplomatic body was an "unfriendly" procedure. According to a certain member of the Municipal Council speaking to reporters last night, the incident of armed Chinese people other than those employed by the Municipal Council entering the Public Concession has always been submitted to the diplomatic body for consideration. The Council submitted a protest to the leader of the diplomatic body on Thursday</p>
<p>The protest was handled according to the old rules, and there was nothing unfriendly about the procedure, nor was there any unfriendly intention. The Japanese spokesperson mentioned the protest made by the Municipal Council, saying that if the Municipal Council intended to resolve this issue with a peaceful and friendly attitude, it should first negotiate with the Japanese Consul General, but the Council submitted the matter to the leader of the diplomatic body for handling. The Japanese side believes this</p>
<p>It is an unfriendly procedure. The Council submitted a protest to the leader of the diplomatic body, and the leader of the diplomatic body has not yet had the opportunity to discuss the matter with the Japanese authorities. The Municipal Council hastily announced the news. The Chairman of the Municipal Council visited the Japanese Consul General at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday. Why did he not mention this matter? It is quite puzzling. The spokesperson answered a reporter's question, stating that the diplomatic body has not yet lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities. When asked about the integrity of the Public Concession being violated, the Municipal Council should follow</p>
<p>The spokesperson replied that in such cases, they believe they should negotiate directly with the Japanese Consul General. A reporter asked a member of the Municipal Council last night if he also knew that the Municipal Council had published the news of sending a note to the leader of the diplomatic body. Why did the Japanese side raise objections alone? The member replied that he did not know, and said that he could not understand why the Japanese side could object, because the Japanese side had repeatedly decided to publish news, and the Municipal Council's actions did not violate any agreements or understandings.</p>
<h3>Thrift and Relief: Voluntary Donations</h3>
<p>Relief Association Sends Out 6,000 Letters</p>
<p>The Thrift Relief Committee appealed to people from all walks of life to donate monthly amounts from savings in consumption to relieve refugees. Recently, it sent out 6,000 letters, vigorously appealing. It is said that those who received this letter from all walks of life expressed sympathy and voluntarily donated funds within their means, sending them to major banks in the city for collection.</p>
<p>Chang-Xi Opera Holds a Grand Joint Performance</p>
<p>Chang-Xi Opera is a type of art that is enjoyed by both the refined and the popular. It is recently learned that the Refugee Relief Association's native-place group in Shanghai, in order to raise funds for refugees, has jointly organized an entertainment fundraising performance by the Changzhou and Wuxi native-place associations. It has specially invited seven Chang-Xi opera troupes performing in Shanghai, including Tianchan, Fuyuan, Ruyi, Chang-Xi, Tongle, and Leyuan Tianyun, to hold a joint grand performance. It is scheduled to be held on April 7th, 8th, and 9th at the Lake Society at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road, with seven troupes performing a joint performance for three days and nights. The program for the first day includes "The Tragedy of Xianglian" during the day and "Pearl Phoenix Green" at night. The second day will feature "Gu Dingchen" during the day and "The Sad Story of Liang Zhu" at night. The third day will feature "The Wonderful Romance of King Zhou" during the day and "The Romance of Three Smiles" at night. Famous male and female performers from all seven troupes will participate.

Various Chang-Xi opera troupes also act as ticket agents.</p>
<p>A Donation of Two Cents Per Dan of Hardware</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the fundraising committee of the Refugee Relief Association's trade association group has actively promoted fundraising work in various trade associations, and its achievements have been remarkable. It is learned that the iron industry, hardware industry, steel bar and scrap iron industry, and copper and tin industry, after being promoted by the association, invited representatives from the four trade associations to discuss the methods of collecting refugee donations. They started collecting on the 21st. There are more than 300 merchants in the industry, all of whom comply. According to the person in charge of the association, he told reporters yesterday that according to regulations, two cents of national currency are collected per market dan, and the daily traffic is quite large, so the results will definitely be considerable.</p>
<p>Insufficient Funding for the Municipal Education and Training Institute</p>
<p>The Women and Children's Education and Training Institute of the Shanghai First Special District Municipal Relief Association held its first board meeting yesterday. Chairman Lin Kanghou delivered a speech, saying that in order to relieve distressed women and children, the association decided to reorganize the reception center at No. 1260 Xiaoshadu Road into a women and children's education and training institute, and has already organized a preparatory committee, appointing Zhou Bangjun, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Yiqing, and Zhu Qizhen as the heads of the preparatory committee. Regarding the start-up funds, in addition to Director Le Gengbao generously providing 100 yuan that has already been received, other directors have also pledged: Zhou Bangjun 1,000 yuan, Zhu Qizhen 100 yuan, Wang Jingdong 100 yuan, Yu Chuanding 100 yuan, and Huang Yuezhi and Zhou Huili of the Kemei Obstetrics Hospital 200 yuan. From the 18th to the 21st of this month, a broadcast propaganda was held at the Washington Radio Station, and with the enthusiastic support of the entertainment industry and the generous donations of people from all walks of life, a total of 3,037.90 yuan of national currency has been raised. In order to plan for long-term relief, it is also planned to solicit adoptions from all walks of life. If time permits, the association plans to officially open the Education and Training Institute in mid-April.</p>
<p>Relief Association Runs a Rattan Workshop</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Association's various reception centers are actively promoting production work for refugees on a daily basis. Recently, in view of the decreasing donations and in order to enable refugees to support themselves in the future, various workshops have been established. The rattan industry is certainly needed by the society. Recently, technicians have been hired and various application materials have been purchased, and refugees have been selected to engage in work.</p>
<h3>Public Mao Salt Depleted: Huai Salt Floods the Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>Initially Sold by Tongmao, then Managed by Longmao. The Huai Salt Production Area Falls, and the Japanese Seize Control</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that the sale of salt in the Shanghai concessions has always been exclusively handled by the Shanghai Concession Salt Public Depot (i.e., Public Mao). This salt was transported to Shanghai from Daishan and other places in eastern Zhejiang. After the war, the Chinese government banned the export of salt from Daishan and other places, so the salt in the Shanghai concessions relied entirely on the Public Mao salt depot's existing stock. Although the Public Mao Salt Depot contacted the Salt Affairs Bureau, requesting permission to transport Zhejiang salt to Shanghai for regulation, Zhejiang salt's transportation to Shanghai was practically difficult due to Shanghai being an occupied area and the coast being blockaded by Japanese warships. Now the salt stored in the Public Mao has been depleted. There is now a company called Tongyuan Salt Industry, which has always been engaged in the business of refined salt. After the war, "Tongmao" signed a sales contract with Tongyuan, claiming that it was responsible for supplying salt in the concessions. It is said that this salt is not produced in Zhejiang, but is actually salt from the Huai region. After the expiration of the "Tongmao" sales contract, it was changed to be sold by the so-called "Longmao Official Salt Depot," which opened yesterday, claiming that all salt for sale in the concessions would be supplied by the depot. If there are any private transport or sales, the depot will apply to the authorities for arrest. It is said that since the Huai salt production area fell, the Japanese have controlled the transport and sale of Huai salt, and the transport of Huai salt to Shanghai requires the permission of the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Church Hospital Property Losses: 1.5 Million</h3>
<p>All Destroyed by Japanese Bombing</p>
<p>Even Those Returned Suffered Heavy Losses</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, as a result of the Japanese military advance, many church organizations have been destroyed. In the past two weeks, three more church hospitals have been destroyed, one in Xi'an, one in Zhengzhou, and one in Pingjiang, all bombed and destroyed by Japanese aircraft. Including these three, the total number of church hospitals destroyed during this decisive battle has now reached fourteen, with another twelve damaged</p>
<p>Or Stolen Occupied Seven, Four More Forced to Close Since the Military Xinghou. According to a recent survey by the responsible party, foreign church medical work in China has been affected by the war, accounting for 14% of the total. The total number of church hospitals is 268, and the estimated loss of hospital property is about 1.5 million yuan. However, the survey indicates that the most important thing is that the result of arbitrarily attacking these organizations has affected the destructive impact on the humanitarian mission of neutral countries. Most of the hospitals occupied have been returned to their legitimate owners, but the damage found is huge. Among them, the equipment is either destroyed or stolen. The hospitals occupied include the Baptist Hospital in Yangzhou, the Shanghai Sanitarium in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Sanitarium Hospital, the Wilkinson Hospital in Suzhou, the Jiaxing Hospital in Huzhou, and the Three Hospitals in Songjiang. In addition to the three mentioned above, the hospitals destroyed</p>
<p>There are also the Nantong Christian Hospital, the Elizabeth Hospital and the Toko Memorial Hospital in Suzhou, and the Christian Hospital in Jiangyin. Those who have been stolen include the Puren Hospital in Wuxi, the Church Hospital in Changsha, and the Graham Hospital in Haizhou.</p>

<p>Pseudo "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an Scheduled to Depart on the 28th</p>
<p>After the northern and southern puppet organizations, under the orchestration of the Japanese side, successively declared their "establishment," the clowns crowed and celebrated, displaying nothing but flattery to the "master" and selling out national interests, and even going to great lengths to plunder money and exploit the people. According to reliable news from foreign sources, the pseudo "North China Government," in order to further sell out economic rights, even organized a "Visiting Japan Economic Inspection Group," led by the puppet Wang Yintai, which departed the day before yesterday. Also, the "pseudo Mayor of Shanghai" Chuan Xiao'an is scheduled to cross the sea to the east on the 28th to attend the so-called "Urban Roundtable Conference."

<p>A Large Number of North China Puppets Go to Japan</p>
<p>In order to flatter the Japanese side and sell out national interests, the pseudo "North China Temporary Government" recently organized the so-called "North China Visiting Japan Economic Inspection Group," led by the pseudo "Minister of Industry" Wang Yintai.

Although the name of this trip is a visit, it is actually to contribute methods of controlling the North China economy and sell out all North China economic rights.</p>
<p>Shanghai Puppets Scheduled to Cross to the East</p>
<p>In order to actively carry out the conspiracy to destroy China, the Japanese side is not only implementing economic aggression, but also taking various vicious means, such as propagating the "New Order in East Asia" and forcing people to study Japanese, in order to anesthetize people's minds. Recently, it has also planned to change the major cities in the estimated territories into Japanese, so it has gathered the so-called "East Asia Metropolitan City Consultation Conference" and ordered the puppet mayors of various places to arrive in Tokyo before the end of March. It is learned that after receiving the "order," the "pseudo Mayor of Shanghai" Chuan Xiao'an has scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the east on the 28th of this month, in order to take the opportunity to flatter the Japanese government and perform his shameless masterpiece.</p>

<h3>Businesses Should Not Refuse to Accept Payments in One-Yuan Legal Tender</h3>
<p>City Federation Sends Letter to Silver Trade Association, Requesting Members to Accept</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent letters to the Bank Association and the Money Trade Association yesterday, stating: "According to letters from the 2nd, 91st, 12th, 21st, 24th, 26th, and 35th District Branches of this Federation, members have reported that various banks and money shops in the city often refuse to accept one-yuan legal tender when merchants or citizens submit larger payments. As a result, before submitting payments, one-yuan legal tender must first be exchanged for five-yuan or ten-yuan legal tender, which is very inconvenient. Since one-yuan legal tender is also a circulating legal tender, it should not be refused in principle and in law. Therefore, we are writing to request that your association forward this letter to the bank and money trade associations, instructing all member banks and money shops to accept one-yuan legal tender in the future to facilitate industry and commerce. We would be most grateful." It has been found that the refusal of banks and money shops to accept one-yuan legal tender when making payments does indeed cause many inconveniences to the business community. Therefore, we are writing to request that your association forward this letter to all member banks and money shops, requesting them to be accommodating and accept one-yuan legal tender in the future to facilitate business payments, which would be a public convenience.</p>
<h3>Thief Calmly Exits Car, Leaving Stolen Goods Inside</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1:30 PM, a friend of the reporter was riding the No. 22 public bus of the French Concession. At that time, the passengers were very crowded. When the bus passed the station at the intersection of Rue Bourgeois and Rue des Soeurs, there were also many passengers waiting there. Suddenly, a person chased after a passenger who was about to board the bus, loudly accusing him of "stealing a wallet" and immediately pulled him down, demanding that he return it. At that time, a Chinese police officer happened to pass by and immediately came forward to inquire. However, the passenger's attitude was strong and he firmly denied it, willing to be searched. At that time, the bus door was closed and sped forward. Suddenly, the ticket seller found a yellow wallet on the footboard of the bus door. Then everyone realized that when the passenger was pulled off the bus, he knew he had been exposed, so he temporarily abandoned the stolen wallet inside the car. The ticket seller immediately announced that he would send the wallet to the company to be claimed by the owner. Recently, there have been many passengers on trams and buses, and they are of mixed quality. Thefts are often heard of. It is hoped that readers will be vigilant.</p>

<h3>Two Criminals Executed for Robbing Huge Sum of Military Funds</h3>
<p>The remaining two criminals also sentenced to severe penalties</p>
<p>Liang Zuocheng, a division commander of the New Fourth Army from Guangdong, along with his fifteen-year-old son and three guards, was carrying 327,000 yuan in military funds in December of the year before last, passing through Qiaoxiang Village in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province. They were stopped by a large number of accomplices, dozens of them, led by the village's bandit leader Da Yuanlin, who had already been executed by firing squad, as well as Chen Youfa, Qiao Detai, Qiao Yikun, and Zhang Bingquan. Commander Liang, his son, and the guards were bound and murdered, and the military funds were robbed, divided, and used. Last spring, Dai Hongfu (31 years old), Qiao Changjin (43 years old), Chen Heshang (32 years old), and Chen Bosheng (16 years old), all Jurong natives who were involved in the case, fled to Shanghai. Dai Hongfu went to the Xiqingchi bathhouse on Jiujiang Road to find a friend. He was recognized by bathhouse attendants Jia Shigen, Zhang Heshang, and Shen Zhigao, who informed Chinese Constable No. 122 and secretly reported to Hua Tantang Shang Wu of the Huishi Police Station. The four suspects, Dai Hongfu and others, were arrested, along with suspect Chen Qiaosheng, and sent to the First Special District Local Court. The police determined that Chen Qiaosheng was not involved and released him on bail.

<h3>Released Prisoners Form Gang, Extorting Money Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>Establish Headquarters at Da Hu Hotel, Police Arrest Nine Criminals and Send Them to Court</p>
<p>Currently, there is a group of bandits who formed a gang while serving time in prison for crimes committed in the past. After their release, the War of Resistance broke out, and these people took advantage of the opportunity to fraudulently obtain money from wealthy merchants under the guise of so-called "Youth Service Society" and "Iron-Blooded Youth Anti-Treason Group." If they failed to defraud, they resorted to robbery. These people not only manufactured various badges and receipts but also carried firearms and committed numerous crimes. After discovering their secrets, Hua Zong Detective Yun Aji, Detective Chen Yonggui, Detective Gao Yong'an, and Detective Shan Zhaoxian of the Laoza Police Station learned that their meeting place was in rooms 205 and 304 of the Da Hu Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. They then coordinated with Western detectives and French police officers to go and arrest them. They arrested as many as 30 male and female criminals in the rooms and seized badges, receipt books of the Iron-Blooded Youth Anti-Treason Group, and seals of the Youth Service Society. Later, at number 282 Caishi Road in the French Concession, they seized a pistol and four bullets, and a fake pistol. After a detailed investigation, it was learned that of the people arrested, only Huang Xin, Huang Chuanwen, Liu Fuqiu, Hua Minxiang, Zhang Caiyi, Zhang Rongshang, Jiang Bofang, Fei Guishun, and Quan Huiquan were involved, while the rest were unrelated. The other 21 people were released. Yesterday morning, the nine people, including Huang, were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. The defendants jointly hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi explained the process, stating that the investigation of the case was not yet complete, so he requested permission for temporary detention in order to prosecute after investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered that all defendants be detained and rescheduled for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Attempted Rape, Village Girl Killed</h3>
<p>Around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, four Japanese soldiers were patrolling along the railway at Lujiawan, west of Meilong Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. Suddenly, they spotted Lu Shuzhen (23 years old), the niece of farmer Lu A'di, working in the field. The Japanese soldiers chased after her, pushed Shuzhen to the ground, and attempted to rape her. However, Shuzhen vowed to resist to the death, and they struggled with each other, and she scratched the Japanese soldier's face. The Japanese soldier became enraged out of shame and fired his gun, firing several shots. Shuzhen died on the spot. Yesterday, her uncle prepared a coffin and collected her body.</p>
<h3>Gambling Losses, Luring Away a Girl</h3>
<p>Father of the Girl Learned and Reported to the Police, Who Caught the Suspect. Others are Being Sought and Investigated.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhou, a woman from Tongzhou, who lived at No. 23, Lane 683, Gaojiazhai, Rue Say Zoong, had a five-year-old daughter named Di. At 11:45 AM on the 24th, Di was playing at the entrance of the lane when she was spotted by Wu Arong (20 years old, a painter from the local area). He lured her away with candy in an attempt to sell her for profit. However, Zhang Miaofa, a neighbor and fellow villager, saw Wu and thought his behavior was suspicious. He reported to Zhang Yaoxuan, the girl's father, and together they tracked Wu down to near the Gongda Yarn Factory on Singapore Road. Hua Constable No. 625 of the Ming Shan Police Station stopped Wu and brought him to the Gordon Road Police Station. The constable ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for abduction under Article 241, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. He stated that the defendant had said at the police station that he had recently been gambling and losing money at the Shenji Casino in Caojiadu and could not make ends meet. After discussing it with a gambler, a certain Jia, who was at large, the two of them went to the place and abducted Zhang's daughter, intending to take her to an empty house and confine her. They first took off her clothes and earrings to pawn them and then try to sell the girl. He asked for a postponement of the case in order to arrest the accomplices. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the defendant and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation on another day.</p>
<h3>Son of an Old Servant of the Sheng Family Arrested for Attempting to Kidnap Young Master</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Failed, Attempted Extortion</p>
<p>Old Servant Learned and Reported to the Police, Who Made the Arrest</p>
<p>Sheng Zecheng (also known as Lao Si), the manager of the Hanyeping Coal Mine Company, lives at No. 75 Yuyuan Road. His nine-year-old son, Yu Peng, attends the Western District Primary School of the Municipal Council at No. 48 Daxilu Road. Usually, every afternoon after school, his family sends a car, number 4444, to pick him up. This had become routine. However, at 3:15 PM on the 20th of this month, Chen Jindu, a native of Changzhou, accompanied by a young woman, arrived at the school gate in a chartered car, number 12182. Chen left the woman in the car and entered the school, telling the doorman of the school, number 2037, that he had come to pick up student Sheng Yu Peng, and that the person sitting in the car was Yu Peng's mother. The doorman did not believe him at first, but because he saw that Yu Peng knew Chen, he agreed to his request. Later, the doorman suspected that the woman in the car was too young to be Yu Peng's mother.</p>
<p>Suspicion arose and he questioned Chen, who became nervous and fled. He detained the woman and the car and reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who sent Hua Detective Wu Chengmo to bring the people and the car to the police station for investigation. It was then learned that Chen Jindu was the son of Chen Fu, an old servant of the Sheng family. Chen Fu had been a servant in the Sheng family for 18 years. Chen Jindu often went to the Sheng family, so he knew Yu Peng. It was decided that Chen Jindu and a certain Jia would conspire to</p>
<p>Kidnap Yu Peng for ransom. They rented a room under the name of Shen Bujain at the Anshang Inn on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession and hired a female guide, using the excuse of going to the theater, to lure her into the car to pretend to be a member of the Sheng family. The car was hired through the tea boy. Detective Wu learned of the situation and released the female guide and the driver. Until yesterday, Chen Fu suddenly received a phone call from his son Chen Jindu, agreeing to talk at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Hart Road. The Jing'an Temple Police Station, both Chinese and Western detectives, based on Chen Fu's report,</p>
<p>Secretly waited and watched until 3:00 PM when Chen arrived. They arrested him and seized four threatening letters from his person, also signed Shen Bujain. The general meaning was that because the kidnapping had failed, they had changed their plan and demanded 1,000 yuan in the letters. Then they went to the Huxi Hotel at Lane 568, Carter Road, and arrested accomplice Zhang Zhixiong (also known as Li Amai), a native of Tongzhou, and brought him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them for extortion under Article 347, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, and detailed the above situation. He requested a postponement. Sheng Zecheng then complained that he did not know about the kidnapping of his son, but that Chen Jindu was the son of Chen Fu, and was usually a foreign coppersmith who had been unemployed since the war and was eating for free at his house, receiving two yuan a month. Chen Jindu confessed to the accusations. Zhang Zhixiong confessed that he was a beggar and was used by Chen, who asked him to write the letters, and that he did not know anything else. Judge Chuan reviewed the confessions and ordered the two defendants to be held for further questioning on April 3.</p>
<h3>Chinese Constable Embezzles Gold Bars</h3>
<p>Chen Jinshan Carried Three Gold Bars to Shanghai to Exchange for Cash, Two Were Confiscated by the Chinese Constable Upon Landing, Original Stolen Goods Recovered, Ma Zongzhen Dismissed and Investigated</p>
<p>Chen Jinshan, a native of Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, 45 years old this year, recently invested in collecting scattered gold ornaments in his hometown and melted them into three gold bars, weighing 38 taels, 7 maces, and 5 fen, worth more than 8,000 yuan. A few days ago, he brought these gold bars from Jiangbei to Shanghai on the Taikoo Company's Wuxue wheel, intending to exchange them for cash at the Tongfengyong Gold Shop at No. 310 Nanjing Road in the Public Concession and then return to Jiangbei</p>
<p>to collect and sell gold ornaments. Unexpectedly, the Wuxue wheel arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the 23rd and docked at Taikoo Wharf No. 1 on the Bund in the French Concession. Chen then hid the gold bars on his body. While landing, Ma Zongzhen (nearly 40 years old, a native of Henan, a Muslim), Chinese Constable No. 412 of the Second Division of the French Concession's Mai Lan Police Station, along with Russian Constable No. 53, Chinese Constable, and Detective Cao, a female inspector, and others, were checking passengers arriving in Shanghai at the wharf when they discovered that Chen Jinshan was carrying</p>
<p>Three gold bars in violation of the National Government's Ministry of Finance's ban. Chen and the gold bars were then taken to the police station by Chinese Constable No. 412 Ma Zongzhen, who reported the situation. After the constable learned that Chen was taking the gold bars to the Tongfengyong Gold Shop, he leniently ordered Chen to find someone to bail him out. Chen then went to Tongfengyong and reported, and later Tongfengyong sent someone with Chen to the French police station to retrieve the gold bars. However, there was only one gold bar left. The other two had been embezzled by Chinese constable No. 412 Ma Zongzhen</p>
<p>in private. Upon discovery, the constable immediately detained Ma and transferred him to the Silk Patrol Police Station for investigation. The chief patrolman ordered the dismissal of Ma from his position as constable and sent Inspector Li Xianyang, Detective Guo Shaorong, Detective Zhang Dongcheng, and Xu Wensheng to investigate. It was learned that Ma had given the two embezzled gold bars to a female fellow villager, Ma Wen, who lived at No. 96 Limei Road, who then forwarded them to relatives in the Tonganli neighborhood on Route Mettens off in West Shanghai. They then went to retrieve the original stolen gold bars</p>
<p>and sent them to the Second Criminal Court yesterday afternoon, requesting that the defendant be arrested and detained for further investigation and prosecution. Judge Miao Qingbang presided over the First Criminal Court for the trial. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer for the French Concession authorities, presented the case. Then, Detective Guo Shaorong reported the investigation and retrieval of the stolen goods after the incident. Then, the plaintiff Chen Jinshan complained about the inspection situation. Questioned about the defendant, Ma Zongzhen confessed that he had only found one gold bar at the time and had taken the plaintiff</p>
<p>back to the police station. When he was near Zhu Baosan Road, the plaintiff said to me that he had two more gold bars on his body. It would be inconvenient to take them into the police station, so he took out the gold bars and asked me to keep them for him, and that he would come and get them after the matter was over. So I kept them for him, etc. Then witness Ma Wen testified that because my father also worked in the police station, I knew the defendant. The night before last, the defendant came to my house, took out a paper package, said it was gold bars, and asked me to keep them for him. Because my mother was not at home, I sent it to</p>
<p>My aunt's house (i.e., Tonganli, Route Mettens) to hide it. I don't know where this thing came from. The court reviewed the confessions and decided to postpone the hearing until the 30th. The defendant was detained, and the stolen goods were temporarily stored in the warehouse. The plaintiff requested to retrieve the gold bars, and he was instructed to prepare all the formal collection procedures before coming to the court to retrieve the gold bars.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Beat Pedestrians</h3>
<p>Jiang Yuanshui (39 years old), a native of Changzhou, intended to take a train to his hometown from Hongkou at 6:30 yesterday morning. When he passed the Garden Bridge, Japanese soldiers wanted to check his pass. Because Jiang took it out too slowly, he angered the Japanese soldiers, who immediately used their rifle butts to strike Jiang's head and hands several times. After Jiang was injured, he was sent to the hospital for treatment by a carriage.</p>
<h3>Manager of Yuanyuan Hat Shop Accused of Deliberately Framing Someone</h3>
<p>Accusing Wu Changlin of Instigating Threats</p>
<p>Wu Countersues for Slander, Trial Scheduled</p>
<p>Fan Jingmei, the shareholder and manager of the Yuanyuan Hat Shop on Shandong Road, was recently sued in the First Special Court by Wu Changlin, an employee of the Chen Tianyi Hat Shop on Jixiang Street in the French Concession, who hired lawyers Fan Gang and Qian Xingzhong to accuse him of deliberately framing someone and requesting that he be brought to justice. The main points of the lawsuit are that the plaintiff is an employee of the Chen Tianyi Hat Shop,</p>
<p>and the defendant, Fan Jingmei, was the former manager of the shop. In 1921, the shareholders discovered that the defendant's accounts were unclear and demanded an investigation. The defendant resigned as a result and has since had a grudge against the shop. There have been more than a dozen lawsuits involving the shop. Employees who had been working in the hat shop for a long time were also listed as defendants, causing some employees to die from depression due to the lawsuits. First there was Zhou Bingwen, then Zou Shicai. Recently, the defendant again falsely claimed that the plaintiff was the</p>
<p>Chief accountant of the Chen Tianyi Hat Shop and filed a lawsuit against the plaintiff in the Second Special Court for embezzlement. The plaintiff believed that the allegations made by the defendant were completely fabricated, so he countersued for slander. That case has not yet been concluded. Unexpectedly, the defendant again falsely reported to the Central Police Station that someone had thrown feces at the Yuanyuan Hat Shop that the defendant had set up at the end of last year's lunar calendar, and that Xie Baodou and Xia, Han and others had threatened the defendant by telephone, saying that they were going to use grenades. It was said that Xie Baodou and others were actually</p>
<p>instigated by the plaintiff. The police then sent Western and Chinese detectives to report to the French police station on the 28th of last month, and they sent personnel to come and arrest the plaintiff. The plaintiff was out at the time, so he was not arrested. The next day, the plaintiff voluntarily surrendered to the police station for investigation and learned that the Xie Bin and others mentioned by the defendant were all identified by the defendant on the phone. It can be seen that the defendant's claim that he was threatened and that the plaintiff instigated it was</p>
<p>completely fictitious and deliberately slanderous. The circumstances are obvious. Therefore, according to Article 169 of the Criminal Law, he filed a charge of slander, requesting that the defendant be punished according to law. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the Third Criminal Court to summon the case. The defendant Fan Jingmei also went to court with a lawyer. Judge Huang stated that according to the police report, Wu Changlin's name was on the list, which clearly meant that the defendant had reported him. The defendant denied it. The court decided to postpone the case to the 30th for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Two People Commit Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>One Dead, One in Critical Condition</p>
<p>Jiang Peng, a local woman, 56 years old, who lived at No. 325 Weihaiwei Road, had a quarrel with her family over family matters at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning. Afterwards, she swallowed a large amount of raw opium and committed suicide. After being discovered by her family, she was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, because she had been poisoned deeply, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 11:00 PM in the evening. Li Weiwu (30 years old), a resident of Room 305 of the Tianran Hotel on Zhizhong Road in the Public Concession, committed suicide by swallowing medicine at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning due to economic pressure. He was later discovered by the waiter and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, he was deeply poisoned and his life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Bandit Shot and Killed</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 PM last night, bandits broke into a certain number 377, Lane, Connault Road, Route Hertaud in West Shanghai and committed robbery. The victim called for the police to catch the bandits. Nearby Chinese constables heard the sound and rushed to the scene. Seeing the police arriving, the bandits immediately used their guns to resist arrest. The Chinese constables also used their guns to return fire. One bandit was shot down at the time and was seriously injured. The remaining bandits did not have time to steal anything and fled in different directions. Afterwards, the injured bandit was sent to the police hospital for treatment, but died shortly after due to his serious injuries. The police are strictly pursuing the bandits at large.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Seven Baskets of Tianjin Vegetables Conceal a Huge Amount of Opium</h3>
<p>Guisheng Wheel Arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin Confiscated</p>
<p>Amounting to More Than 3,000 Taels, Perpetrators Fled</p>
<p>The Guisheng Wheel of the Jardine Matheson Company, fully loaded with cargo and passengers, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin the day before yesterday and docked at the Beijing Road Wharf at 4:00 PM. Customs officers boarded the ship for inspection, but after two hours, they found nothing. At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, they boarded the ship for a second inspection. After four hours, at 10:00 AM, they suddenly discovered a large amount of Northern opium, amounting to more than 3,000 taels, concealed in 27 heavy baskets of Tianjin vegetables, worth more than 50,000 yuan. The people carrying the opium had already fled. The opium, along with the 27 baskets of Tianjin vegetables, was confiscated by customs.</p>
<h3>Case of Li Yongkuan and His Sons Rescheduled for Trial</h3>
<p>Due to the Presiding Judge's Leave of Absence</p>
<p>Li Yongkuan, a well-known Anhui salt smuggler, and his four sons, Li Jiaqi, Jia Zhou, and Bi Hua, made a living by selling salt in Minhang before August 13. After the outbreak of war, after the National Army retreated westward, Li and others became traitors, leading the enemy ashore, gathering accomplices, calling themselves the Eleventh Army, and setting fires and looting everywhere, doing whatever they wanted. They used Caojing in Punan as their base and forcibly married She Yuexian (17 years old), the daughter of She Zhuping, the owner of the Xihutang Pharmacy in Songjiang County, and Lin Xiuhua, the daughter of Lin Ban, to Jia Zhou and Bi Hua. Beforehand, they had washed away the clothes and property of the She and Lin families three times. Afterwards, Li Yazhou shot and killed Lin Xiuhua's daughter and buried her in a pit. The villagers feared them like tigers and dared not compare with them. Moreover, because the area was in the occupied area, there was no way to report or investigate. Until April of last year, after the regular army's 61st Division learned of this, Li was disarmed. Because Li could not stand in the countryside, in September, he took his family with the two daughters of the Lin and She families to Shanghai, renting at No. 11, Middle and New Village, Ciyou Road, behind the Xujiahui Catholic Church, restricting the two girls' freedom of movement. Until December 10 of last year, the two girls of the Lin and She families were able to escape by chance and seek help from the Virgin Mary's Hospital in the Catholic Church. The hospital reported to the French police, who broke in on the 12th, sending detectives to arrest Li Yongkuan, Li Yazhou, and Li Biba, one after another, and seized the original stolen gold bracelets, gold rings, leather clothes, and other items from the homes of the Lin and She families and took them back to the police station for investigation before sending them to the Second Special Court for legal action. Due to the jurisdiction issue, the Second Special Court reported to the Supreme Court, which designated the Second Special Court to hear the case. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. This case was scheduled for a continuation hearing yesterday afternoon, but because Judge Liao, who was presiding over the case, had requested leave, Judge Miao presided over the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought to the case. Without questioning them, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for 2:00 PM on the 28th. The defendants were still held at the police station. It is said that the court has sent personnel to the countryside in secret to investigate the evidence due to the serious circumstances of this case, in order to be cautious and thorough, in order to ensure that there is no injustice. The evidence has not yet come back and is indeed awaiting evidence.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao Yilong Rice Shop Owner Ding Shanming Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Ding Shanming, the owner of Yilong Rice Shop in Hongqiao Town, West Shanghai, is 35 years old, a graduate of Aurora University, and comes from a wealthy family. He owns a three-unit residential building in Henan, in the town, which was almost completely burned down by Japanese soldiers last year. After the Shanghai war, Ding remained in the countryside, running his rice business, and profited greatly. Recently, he was coveted by bandits. The other day, at dusk, more than ten bandits suddenly appeared, each armed with guns, and stormed into the shop. They robbed more than 200 French currency from the drawer in the accounting office and kidnapped the shop owner, Ding Shanming, before leaving. It is now said that the bandits sent a letter demanding a ransom of 5,000 yuan for his release.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Shoot Boatmen</h3>
<p>Two Thieves Beheaded</p>
<p>Recently, three thieves in the western part of the Suzhou River, at night, took a small boat to cross over to Zhabei to steal. Unexpectedly, when they landed, they were noticed by the Japanese Marine Corps guards there, who immediately opened fire and ordered them to stop. The thieves, realizing that the situation was bad, immediately tried to escape. As a result, two of them were caught by the Japanese soldiers, and one escaped. However, one boatman was shot and killed during the gunfire, and the two captured thieves were immediately taken to the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters for interrogation. Then, in the evening, they were taken to the burned-out open space behind the Traffic Bank warehouse and beheaded.</p>
<h3>Receiving Stolen Mud Case - Sentencing Set for the 31st</h3>
<p>The German firm禅臣 洋行 (Zen Sun &amp; Co.) due to debt, took over all the machinery and goods of the Shanghai Cement Plant in South Shanghai. After being occupied by the X army, all the Elephant Brand cement was moved away, worth hundreds of thousands. It was later found that sixteen brick and ash shops in the public concession were selling these stolen goods, so they sued the Special No. 1 Court. It was found that Yonghe Brick and Ash Shop at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route du Marche, Zhihe Brick and Ash Shop on Route Petain, and Huifeng Hardware Store on Min Guo Road in the French Concession were also selling the stolen cement. Therefore, lawyers were commissioned to sue the three managers, Huang Jingqing, Xu Zhengde, Meng Yiming, and others for the crime of receiving stolen goods in the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. The case was initially heard by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, and it was decided to transfer the files to the Special No. 1 Court for verification and further questioning. Yesterday morning, the court reopened for further trial. After questioning the defendants in court, they all claimed that they had purchased the goods from Yuanda Hardware Store on Jiangxi Road and had no knowledge of receiving stolen goods, with invoices as proof. The court considered the case to be clear and ordered the defense to be presented before adjourning the hearing. Sentencing is scheduled for the 31st.</p>

<h3>Luo Jiaqiao Blockaded, All Vessels Stop at Wanfu Bridge</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side blockaded various small ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, most foreign vessels have been traveling to Luojiaqiao in the new port. Further upstream is controlled by Japanese commercial vessels. Unexpectedly, Luo Jiaqiao is also within the blockade. Yuan Luchen, the puppet magistrate of Jingjiang, in order to make up for the shortage of income, recently went to Nantong by car with the puppet Japanese secretary Xiong Shengzhi and Tao Mingde to request Captain Matsuura, the commander of the Japanese Jiangbei Garrison, to allow Jianglun vessels to open and dock at Luo Jiaqiao, but the request was rejected. Therefore, in recent days, the Japanese troops in Luo Jiaqiao in the Sixth District have opened fire indiscriminately whenever ships enter the port. As a result, ships such as Luan and Haide have changed their stops to Wanfu Bridge to the east of Luo Jiaqiao.</p>

<h3>Arrested Thief Gang and Sent to Court</h3>
<p>Waiting for Further Investigation of Accomplices and Crimes</p>

<h3>High-Pressure System Passing Through, Weather Suddenly Turns Cold</h3>
<p>Wind Force Does Not Abate, Temperature Lower Than Yesterday</p>
<p>The weather in this city has been gradually warming in recent days. Since the day before yesterday, a strong northerly wind suddenly blew, and the temperature dropped sharply. The wind became even stronger in the evening, followed by rain. Although the rain had turned to clear skies yesterday, the northerly wind had not abated, and the weather remained cold. According to inquiries with the Observatory, the reason for this sudden change in weather is due to the passage of a high-pressure system from northern China. The high-pressure system is moving eastward and has not yet crossed the eastern part of China, so the wind has not stopped, and the weather is cold. It is expected that the weather will not change further, and the temperature will not decrease further. The lowest temperature yesterday was 33 degrees, which was lower than the day before.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Nickel Coins Discovered</h3>
<p>The two types of hard currency, nickel and copper coins, circulating in this city are becoming increasingly scarce, and most of those in circulation are auxiliary currency notes.

However, the counterfeit coins have no image of Sun Yat-sen on the back. Citizens rarely pay attention, so those who are deceived and suffer losses are countless.</p>

<h3>St. Francis Unable to Withstand the Attack, Tung Wah Wins Reserve Group Championship</h3>
<p>Tung Wah Wins Big 6-1 Yesterday</p>
<p>The Western League reserve group football match between Tung Wah and St. Francis was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Nearly 2,000 spectators attended. St. Francis's strong players, 福恩 (Fu En), 卡洛列區 (Kalolie Qu), 愛德華 (Ai Dehua), and 許爾茲 (Xu Erz) all played, hoping to deal Tung Wah a serious blow. Tung Wah knew their plan, and because this match was related to the championship, they also fought with a strong lineup. Just two minutes after the start of the match, Jia Youliang made a high shot at the goal, and the opponent's goalkeeper fell down carelessly. The ball was blown into the net by the wind, and Tung Wah took the lead. Twenty minutes later, Wan Jin shot, and Shen Shiyan headed the ball straight into the corner of the goal, giving Tung Wah a 2-0 lead. Seventeen minutes later, 沙洛維夫 (Shaluoweifu) scored a goal, and St. Francis pulled back one goal. In the first half, half a minute before the end, Wan Jin also scored a goal, ending the first half with a score of 3-1, with St. Francis trailing by two goals. In the second half, Tung Wah's attack was strong, but they could not find the goal. It was not until the 22nd minute that Wan Jin broke the deadlock with a successful shot. Six minutes later, Sun Huizhang shot at the goal, hitting the goalpost and bouncing back. Shen Shiyan caught up and pushed the ball in, but Sun was offside and the goal was disallowed. In the 35th minute, Shen Shiyan scored a goal, and one minute later, Sun Huizhang followed up with another goal. With time running out, Tung Wah defeated St. Francis 6-1, winning the championship. There is only one game left between the two teams, St. Francis against Aurora, which is irrelevant to the overall situation. The lineups of both teams are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Lido Celebration Tea Dance Today</h3>
<p>The Lido Sports Association, with the active promotion of the Gao Huai De and Huai Liang brothers, has become increasingly famous in recent months. Cross-country, race walking, and small ball have been repeatedly fought and won, with silver cups and shields piled up like mountains. The football team recently won the Scott Cup, which has only been won twice by Chinese teams in more than 30 years, which is the ultimate honor. The other day, they defeated the Surveying Team again and returned with the Junior Cup. As for their Group C championship, it is undoubtedly theirs. In total, Lido has won the soccer three-cotton standard, the fifth All-Shanghai Open Championship for race walking, the International Cup and Lincoln Cup for cross-country, the Min Guang Cup (won two times), and the Yong Yi Cup, Binhai Cup, Green Fruit Cup (charity match) for small ball. The football team's 3-2 victory over the Joint Forces team, which gathered the elite forces of Shanghai, was even more shocking to China and abroad. To celebrate the occasion, President Gao has specially set aside 5:00 PM today to hold a grand tea dance, inviting famous Chinese and foreign figures from all over Shanghai, senior sports figures, and Chinese and Western reporters. At that time, the intersection of Machetz Road and Hersht Road will be busy with traffic, presenting an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Zhuang Zexuan Discusses Higher Education Reform Issues (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Cultivating Talent for Inland Construction</p>
<p>Cultivating Specialized Talent for Frontier Colonization</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuang Zexuan, a renowned professor at a domestic university, previously discussed issues concerning secondary education reform, which received significant attention from the education sector. Recently, he has also discussed issues of higher education reform. His proposals are highly relevant to current problems. We are now publishing Mr. Zhuang's original text below:</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago, I published my opinions on the "Revolution in Higher Education," believing that future universities should be divided into three parts: (1) "Continuing Existing Training," (2) "Cultivating Talent for Inland Construction," and (3) "Cultivating Specialized Talent for Frontier Colonization." Since the War of Resistance, I have felt even more strongly the necessity of implementing this kind of division. The reason I advocate for universities to add parts (2) and (3) can be explained from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In theory, I believe that: (1) Chinese education must follow a path that suits the Chinese nation to find a way out; (2) The way out for the Chinese nation currently lies in two active avenues: (a) Reorganizing the inland to stabilize people's lives and discover the advantages of (inherent) culture, and (b) Developing the frontier to establish a new life for the old culture; (3) The way out for the Chinese nation must also consider two points from a passive perspective: (a) Striving for efficiency in time, energy, and especially in the use of funds to support the precarious situation, and (b) Encouraging national self-confidence and self-reliance to create a psychological foundation for revival; (4) For the sake of reorganizing the inland, what we need most is the training of leaders in rural construction, while the general population should receive broad-based public education; (5) For the sake of developing the frontier, government capitalists must cooperate with experts, applying scientific knowledge and skills, working from film to promotion. During promotion, special training must be given to immigrants; (6) To strive for economic efficiency, government and social leaders must promote a frugal lifestyle and prevent all waste. All education must focus on thrift; (7) To build national self-confidence and self-reliance, we should promote the virtues of the Chinese nation at all times and places, disseminate the great achievements and figures in history, and promote domestic goods. These words seem even more urgent today, after twenty months of the War of Resistance. From a practical perspective, we know that before the War of Resistance, institutions of higher education that attempted to work on reorganizing the inland included the Henan Rural Governance College, the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute, the Hebei County Administration Construction Research Institute, the Jiangsu Provincial Education College, the Sichuan Provincial Education College, and the Rural Administration Practice Center jointly established by the five universities of North China in Jining, Shandong. Institutions that attempted to work on developing the frontier included the branches of the Central Political School established in various frontier regions. After observing education in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai, I suggested enriching Gansu College to become a center for researching frontier culture and experimenting with frontier education. In fact, overseas emigration is also an important part of this work and was one of the original intentions of establishing National Jinan University. After the War of Resistance, due to the expansion of the war zone, many public and private universities moved from the coastal provinces to the inland and remote provinces. Although some were left in foreign concessions, this relocation and remaining were mostly decided on the spur of the moment and rarely planned in advance. As a result, some provinces have a plethora of higher education institutions, with no plan for division of labor and cooperation. However, places in need of higher education lack such institutions, and no universities have moved there, leading to the establishment of a provincial temporary university in Zhejiang.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>Private Elementary Schools Promote Spiritual Mobilization</h3>
<p>Since the central government announced the National Spiritual Mobilization Order, the Liaison Association of Private Elementary School Principals in this city has been initiating promotion by the chairman convening the directors, and then the directors promoting the members, all promoting it together. The spiritual mobilization of private elementary school principals has already begun to be implemented in various schools this week. Some faculty and staff have been fully mobilized. All faculty and staff are very excited. According to the planned schedule, the association can complete this work simultaneously in all educational corporations in the city.</p>
<h3>Ding Fubao's Collection Donated to Aurora University</h3>
<p>More than 50,000 volumes in total</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao, a famous doctor in this city, recently donated all of his treasured collection of over 50,000 volumes of ancient books to the Aurora University Library on Rue Luber. Last year, Mr. Ding established the "Ding's Library" inside the Medical Bookstore on Meizi Road to meet the needs of society. However, the site was too small and insufficient to accommodate his entire collection. Therefore, he made a grand wish to donate all of his books to a larger library. Coincidentally, Aurora University on Rue Luber had just completed a new library the year before, which was opened to the public, attracting the attention of those who love to learn. When the library heard of Mr. Ding's intention to donate books, they immediately made contact. Mr. Ding readily agreed and agreed with the school on seven methods for donating the books, which were officially signed this Saturday (the 25th). The collection will be named "Ding's Collection" in memory. All books have begun to be transported to the school library in batches by truck. Once the handover is complete, they will be quickly cataloged and made available for circulation. It is also heard that the library intends to hold an exhibition of Ding's collection in the autumn semester, after some slight organization, selecting several fine editions, along with Mr. Ding's own books, annotated books, so that the public can see them first.</p>
<h3>Education Briefs</h3>
<p>Mr. Biao Can, one of the seven elders of Cambridge University in England, a 79-year-old pastor, arrived in Hong Kong on the 17th of this month, and then arrived in Shanghai on the British ship Gough the day before yesterday. After staying in Shanghai for a few days, he will go to the mainland through Zhejiang to observe the actual situation of China's War of Resistance. Finally, he will go to Sichuan to visit his son, who is now in charge of hospital affairs at the Baoning Hospital in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Recently, shameless merchants have been promoting inferior goods to various schools, falsely using the names of Chen Heqin and representatives of the Ministry of Education. The Private School Advancement Association has informed all schools to be vigilant.</p>
<p>Chinese and American students at Johns Hopkins University in Shanghai have launched an alumni association. The first gathering dinner will be held at the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road, West Bridge, at 7 pm on March 28. Students who have not received a notice can directly notify Dai Shi, Room 103, No. 496, Avenue Joffre, telephone number 80076, to reserve a seat.</p>
<p>The Society of Geographic Trade will hold its 15th annual meeting in Chongqing this month. In accordance with the regulations, directors will be re-elected in Chongqing within this month. At that time, directors will also be re-elected in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<h3>Rescuing the Famine of Short Plays</h3>
<p>— Ye Fugen</p>
<p>— From the Weekly Performances of the Drama Society to Playwriting —</p>
<p>The "play famine," a serious symptom in the theatrical movement, becomes increasingly severe as theatrical work unfolds. How to solve the "play famine" has become an important issue in theatrical workers' meetings for several years, but it has not been resolved. This is one of the main reasons why the theatrical movement cannot keep pace with objective conditions and develop to the stage it should and can reach.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, the relatively large number of play publications in magazines such as "Guangming" Bi-monthly, "Drama Times," and "New Drama" laid the foundation for the mobile theatrical troupes on the eve of the War of Resistance and the thriving national salvation theatrical troupes at the beginning of the War of Resistance. However, with the development of the War of Resistance situation, the theatrical situation changed drastically. Compared with any artistic field in the cultural sector, theatrical work unfolded at the highest speed. On the one hand, the need for performances increased sharply, and the old scripts immediately felt insufficient; on the other hand, due to changes and expansion in objective conditions and the audience, the old scripts naturally became unsuitable for application. As a result, the symptom of "play famine" became more serious. Unfortunately, the Third Department of the Arts Office, which has a majority of playwrights and is led by Mr. Tian Han, known for his speed in writing plays, was unable to systematically and planfully produce and supply a large number of plays to theatrical troupes in various places, in addition to dispatching theatrical troupes. Of course, theatrical troupes in various places can create, rush to make, and adapt scripts suitable for the locality of each theatrical base, which can achieve special performance effects; however, scripts with universal themes suitable for general performances can be widely distributed, and its universal effect should be even more considerable.</p>
<p>Until four months ago, in a Chongqing dispatch in this newspaper, we saw the Ministry of Education's "Thirteen Methods for Publicly Soliciting Anti-Japanese War Scripts as a Propaganda Weapon." For example, the first rule stipulates: "In order to encourage playwriting and to enable the general public to have a deep understanding of the War of Resistance and national construction, we are publicly soliciting excellent plays and operas that are beneficial to the War of Resistance and national construction, for use in public performances by the theater community." This is one of the concrete measures attempting to solve the "play famine."</p>
<p>The methods set for this public solicitation are quite detailed and specific: in terms of types, there are two types of plays: multi-act plays and one-act plays; in terms of nature, including plays and operas (referring to Peking opera and Sichuan opera); in terms of form, attention is paid to performances that can be performed in both urban and rural areas; the production method is mainly based on new creations that have not been published, supplemented by translations of good foreign works or adaptations of existing operas; the evaluation is by the Ministry of Education hiring experts to form an evaluation committee; the awards are provided in cash, and the copyright still belongs to the author.</p>
<p>The deadline for solicitation, the end of March, is just around the corner. How many scripts have been submitted? How large is the number of excellent and applicable scripts among them? To what extent can the "play famine" be alleviated? This is unknown to us who are far away in the isolated island of Shanghai and have no contact with the Ministry of Education. I hope that the results of this solicitation will be very fruitful, with excellent results, and that it will be able to alleviate most of the serious symptoms of the "play famine."</p>
<p>Here, let's talk about recent events. Hope is just hope, even if the Ministry of Education's solicitation of scripts achieves satisfactory results, how much benefit and treatment will it have for the "play famine" symptom in our local theatrical work at this time and place? The limitations of objective conditions are so severe! There are so few available scripts and new creations! On the contrary, the need has greatly increased. Look: the Yilin Drama Society is reheating "cold rice" in the Sunday morning show at the Carlton Theater. Although one-third of the performances of the Amateur Theater Friendship Society at the Green Treasure Theater are new works, the supply required by the remaining thirty or forty small theater groups is still too far off. What about the Shanghai Drama Society? Although the multi-act full-length plays used for large performances can be self-sufficient, some of the performance catalogs announced for the weekly experimental performances are quite difficult to satisfy! Obviously, performance restrictions are ten times more constrained than in the mainland, and creation is also lacking many times compared to the mainland. The lack of short plays in small performances is simply forming a starvation disease due to famine.</p>
<p>What to do? If the disease is on oneself, one must take medicine while sick. The famine of short plays in Shanghai must be rescued by our Shanghai theater people themselves.</p>
<p>Originally, performance work and playwriting are mutually causal. There is a contradictory opposition and a contradictory unity between performance and creation. Sometimes, due to a lack of performance opportunities and a stagnant atmosphere, the creative atmosphere will decline; conversely, sometimes the abundance or quality of creative scripts will stimulate a climax of performance work; this is a mutually influencing causal effect. Sometimes, due to many and intense performance opportunities, playwrights are busy with stage work and have little time to write at their desks, and the creation of plays will decrease accordingly; this is the contradiction between the two. (Of course, the so-called reduction in creation here refers to the quantity of playwriting. The script produced by a playwright who is busy participating in practical stage work will often surpass that of a screenwriter who spends all day working at a desk.) Sometimes, due to many and intense performance opportunities, the actual need will stimulate playwrights to produce more works; this is the unity of the two working relationships.</p>
<p>Now, how should we link small performance work with short play creation work? This is a question of how theater workers can appropriately coordinate the two sides and advance at the same time. Only by solving this problem can the play famine in Sunday morning performances be rescued.</p>
<p>Here, let me copy down the scope of topics limited in the Ministry of Education's script solicitation methods for comrades who are interested in playwriting to use as a reference:</p>
<p>(A) Clarifying that the interests of the nation and the people are higher than everything else, and enhancing the people's belief in serving the nation and the people.</p>
<p>(B) Encouraging compatriots from all walks of life to eliminate all prejudices, thoroughly and sincerely unite, unify their will, support the leader, support the government, and implement the policies of the War of Resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>(C) Exposing the brutality and ambitions of the invaders.</p>
<p>(D) Explaining the strategy of comprehensive and long-term resistance to strengthen the people's belief in the final victory.</p>
<p>(E) Advocating production and construction, saving, donating money, national military service, voluntary labor, contributing money and effort to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(F) Commending loyalty and martyrdom, eradicating traitors, and eliminating the ideas of complacency and decadence to consolidate the rear.</p>
<p>(G) Other magnificent historical events that inspire the people and benefit the War of Resistance and national construction, or modern stories that are beneficial to the world and people's hearts.</p>
<p>Note: The above seven items are copied from the Chongqing dispatch in the education column of the January issue of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Taking these scope of materials as the premise, coordinating them with the special conditions of this time and place, and using the special, universal, and typical personnel that occur and exist in this special environment to image, sing, cry, both sad and magnificent stories or materials; objects and events that can be praised, satirized, exposed, and hinted at, aren't there many of them? Write it, friend! If you have the experience of writing plays and can skillfully compile them, you can naturally succeed. Otherwise, as long as the attitude is loyal, the writing style is realistic, the emotions are sincere, the images are vivid, and the writing is simple, it can also be considered a high-quality work.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to pass on the words of Kikuchi Kan to young theater people who are interested in writing plays but have not tried it yet, as encouragement, to replace the conclusion:</p>
<p>"Novels are not easy to learn, there is no teaching method, and there is no learning method. Drama, because it has a format, is easy to learn, and the effect of hard work can also be seen. Compared with novels, it is easier to get started and easier to improve."</p>
<p>"The first reason for the depression of new drama writers is simply not working hard."</p>
<p>"Except for those who have no literary qualities at all, as long as they are willing to work hard, and they write appropriately, it is impossible not to write."</p>
<p>"As long as you can continue to work hard on drama, good works can definitely be obtained. As long as you can make good works, no matter how unknown you are, you can become famous overnight. Compared with novels, the outcome of drama is easier to determine..."</p>
<p>Friend, since you have not gone to the front line to gamble on the victory of the nation, why not gamble on the victory in playwriting? Come on, give it a try and save the play famine.</p>
<h3>The Gambler's End</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen Huanlong</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "The Son of Frankenstein"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>“Son of Frankenstein”</p>
<p>Produced by Universal Company, shown at the Da Guangming Theater</p>
<p>In terms of the cast, "The Son of Frankenstein" will undoubtedly be a film that audiences who like to watch horror films will pay attention to. "Frankenstein" Karloff, "Zombie" Lugosi, and Leon Errol, who impressed people in the color horror film "Mystery of the Wax Museum," are all "competing" here; with such a grand lineup, gathering "terrorists" together, it certainly has its momentum in the appeal of "business eyes," but in such a "momentum" of gathering "terrorists" together, we also see the fate of horror films reaching the end of their rope. The hired screenwriters of Hollywood have exhausted their bizarre and absurd ideas, and the producers are unwilling to give up the production of horror films. Therefore, they have to gather "terrorists" together as an appeal to "business eyes."</p>
<p>In fact, a horror film cannot be supported by a few actors alone; the most important factor is not so much the actors as it is the photography, effects, and even makeup; and the one that determines their soul is the director's weaving. Screenwriters, judging from the few films I have seen, almost all steal the name of science and use their fantasies to bewitch the audience. The amount of ingredients is only the strength of the fantasy.</p>
<p>"The Son of Frankenstein" is also like this. And for convenience, this is still a continuation of "Frankenstein." The protagonist in the play is no longer Baron Frankenstein, but his son Walford. "Walford accidentally went to the laboratory where the baron studied science during his lifetime to inspect it, and unexpectedly met the madman Yegor. Yegor was sentenced to hanging for stealing corpses, and his body was abandoned in a chaotic post after the execution. Unexpectedly, although Yegor's neck was broken, he was immortal. He hid in the baron's laboratory and teamed up with the monster to instigate the monster to kill six jurors in the village. Yegor led Hua to the baron's tomb, where he saw the Frankenstein monster lying stiffly inside. Hua was quite horrified. Yegor said that the monster was struck by electricity, causing him to faint and be unconscious. He begged Hua to treat him. Hua has always liked to study science, and he couldn't help but itch when he heard the words," so he treated him, and then harmed his hometown again, and then, "the monster accidentally fell into a boiling sulfur pit," and then ended.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the so-called "science" in horror films is just a synonym for the screenwriter's fantasy. By letting this fantasy run wild, he can do whatever he wants, and he has also run out of the guise of "science." For example, Yegor in this film is "immortal even though his neck is broken," and he can also instigate the monster to go out and snipe jurors. Due to such a convenient fantasy, the "resurrection" of the "monster" is naturally unimportant, and it is not necessary to have a scientific basis.</p>
<p>What about the performance results? The castle, the tomb, the solitary and monotonous architecture, the eerie and strong light, the sudden high notes, or the sobbing flute and the horrible laughter, are repeatedly applied, but they are only continuously applied. There is no center, and there is no systematic organization. Therefore, these things that we are familiar with in general horror films give us a very faint impression. A gun has to move its machine hub and aim at the target to kill people. If the target is not accurate and the injury is not vital, it will weaken its function. Of course, this is not a reason to acquit the murderer, but fortunately, the other party is just an inferior shooter.</p>
<p>If you want me to talk about the actors' acting skills, then I like Leon Errol. His detective with a broken right arm gave him many opportunities to act; as for Karloff and Lugosi, they just maintained their original state.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Praising the Centenarian, One Sprout Bears Three Blossoms, Narrating Friendship, Two Scholars Meet Heroes</p>
<p>When it was time for lunch, Zhu Airen said to them, "I'm going to the nursery this afternoon. Would you like to go and take a look?" When the two Miss He heard that they were going to the nursery, they were of course extra happy. Because the first reason was that they heard Airen talk about the triplets yesterday, and they wanted to see them. Although they themselves are twins, they only have one more person now, and they seem to find it very strange. He Liyu said first, "Sister Airen! When we go to the nursery, can we go and see the three 'mutants' of the Fang family? Didn't you already promise us yesterday?" Zhu Airen smiled and said, "Of course you can see them. But in fact, there is nothing to see, just three little children with the same appearance. It's better for you to look at yourselves than to look at them." At this time, He Liyu suddenly thought of something, and whispered two sentences to Shuangyu. It turned out that she remembered Zhu Airen's joking remark yesterday, saying, "I can't let you see them for nothing, you have to pay a meeting fee." Although they also knew that this sentence was said in jest, it seemed that for these triplets, there should be some gifts, preferably toys. But in such a short period of time, where would they find three of the same things? While they were whispering to each other, Zhu Airen was very sensitive and had already noticed. She said, "What are you discussing? I already know. Yesterday I was just joking, but you took it seriously and thought you really had to pay a meeting fee? Then we have become disguised beggars for the children to perform tricks. If you want to give any gifts, you can give them later, you don't have to do it right now. Besides, in our nursery, we have cultivated a sense of public awareness from childhood. There is no saying that a certain toy is the private property of a certain child. All toys can be played by everyone. Therefore, whenever anyone comes to the nursery and sees these triplets, they give clothes, toys, etc. But we also make it public, and it is not exclusively for the three children of the Fang family. But we think that this sense of public spirit should be cultivated from an early age." He Bianyu said, "Okay! Then even if we want to give something, we will slowly think about what to give." After eating lunch, the two Miss He followed Zhu Airen to the nursery. There are more than 300 babies in this nursery, about the same number of boys and girls. However, the children there are only raised to the age of six, at most to the age of seven. Because six or seven years old is the age to go to elementary school, it is not within the scope of the nursery, so the parents or guardians of the children have to find their own way. (70)</p>

<h3>London Left-Wing People Perform Anti-Fascist Satire</h3>
<p>— Danyun</p>
<p>There is a theater for left-wing people in the north of London, called the Unity Theater. Recently, every night it performs a political satire of a large scale that can be said to be rare in England, which has caused a sensation.</p>
<p>This satire is called "The Child in the Forest." It was originally adapted from a rich saying told to children. The content is about an easily deceived old gentleman whose name is "Bad Uncle" and two robbers who get land. Now, the ones performing at the "Unity" Theater are all workers. They perform this script every night after work. They adapted it themselves to perform the tragedy of Czechoslovakia, and satirized Chamberlain, Hitler, and Mussolini. They even ridiculed the King and Queen of England.</p>
<p>But the result of this satire is happy, and not as tragic as the Czech incident. Because the script performs that the "Bad Uncle" forced the small family under his protection to give the land to the robbers in order to survive. However, at the critical moment, a knight came to help and drew his sword to help. In order to "educate" the people and unite them, the knight stopped the "Bad Uncle" and said that he couldn't do this, so he saved the small family under the protection of the "Bad Uncle." Who is this knight? It turns out to be Robin Hood.</p>
<p>But there is a question, wouldn't such a drama satirizing the heads of state be banned? It turns out that the "Unity Theater" is a club, with a membership fee of five corners, plus a ticket price of at least two corners and five points and up to six corners and two points, so inspectors cannot interfere.</p>
<p>The "Unity Theater" is very small, and can only accommodate 380 people, but so far, 14,000 people have watched this satire. It is expected that before the show closes, another 20,000 people will go to see it.</p>
<p>Several of the theater organizers are left-leaning intellectuals. Their purpose is to assist in the urgent struggle for world peace, and to oppose Fascism by performing dramas that are realistic, reflect current life, and do not just show a world of dreams that escape reality. I recently received a page from Shen Bao forty years ago from a friend. It was probably the era of oiled paper. According to its age, it was still during the Guangxu period. I am now transcribing several of its theater advertisements as follows:</p>

<h3>蒨蒨室劇話</h3>
<p>— By 肖傖</p>
<p>A Beauty Greatly Admired Wang Yu-feng's Sanxian Ballad Singing; Offered 100,000 Yuan to Invite Wang to Europe, but Wang Refused to Go</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, there were two remarkable figures in Beijing, both blind men: (1) The face-reading bone toucher, Little Blind Man, who was greatly renowned for his divine physiognomy, especially his prediction about Yuan Shikai, which was the most remarkably accurate. When Yuan Xiangcheng was thirty-seven years old, he sought refuge in Beijing from Korea, feeling quite depressed. He visited Little Blind Man for a bone-touching face reading. Following the usual procedure, Little Blind Man touched his bones and said to Xiangcheng, "I usually charge one gold piece for a face reading, but your case is very different from ordinary people, so I require five gold pieces to offer you a few words." Xiangcheng said, "Agreed." Little Blind Man said, "Your fortune will rise at forty, be killed at sixty, be below one person, and above ten thousand people." Xiangcheng, at that time, was also intimidated by the power of autocracy, fearing that others would know, and quickly left. Later, Xiangcheng indeed received the position of Commander of the Right Army of the Wuwei at the age of forty. From then on, he had smooth sailing, and his name shook the country. At the age of fifty-nine, he died after taking broad beans. It is said that Little Blind Man was eventually murdered by Yuan's people, but the truth of this remains unknown. (2) The blind man Wang Yu-feng, skilled in the sanxian, could produce the sounds of various opera tunes and military music between his fingers. His sanxian ballad singing of Peking Opera could accurately imitate the voices of famous performers. Thirty years ago, my friend Mr. Xi Yanzi was able to, in a movie theater on Sanma Road in Shanghai, now the site of a Qingyise store, pay for two balcony seats to quietly listen to Wang Yu-feng's sanxian ballad singing. Yu-feng played the song "Entering the Palace Twice," imitating Tan Xinpei for the male roles, Chen Delin for the female roles, and Qiu Guixian for the painted face roles. Those in the audience who listened with their eyes closed could not help but tap their feet and praise at the highlights. Today's sanxian ballad singing and sanxian opera are mostly inherited from his style. In that year, an American wealthy merchant valued his art and specially negotiated with him, inviting him to perform in Victoria, offering 100,000 gold as a gift, but Yu-feng did not agree. The world is amazed at the high prices Mei Lanfang received for going to the United States and Russia, but in fact, Wang Yu-feng, as a substitute, had already greatly impressed Europeans and Americans thirty years ago, and his skill relied solely on the movement of his fingers. To pass down the art, Wang Yu-feng was truly a remarkable figure in Beijing.</p>
<p>Talking About Opera Advertisements from Forty Years Ago</p>
<p>Opera advertisements aim to attract audiences. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the opera business has developed in a distorted manner. Those in charge did not devote themselves to advertising and promotion to achieve significant results. Recently, there was Golden's "Standard Peking Opera," the Common Stage's "Taking Off Pants in Public, Ruining Feng Shui on the Grave," the Great Stage's "One Table of Dishes Flying In, Head-On Collision, Don't Turn Off the Lights," Carlton's "Escaping Fire Towards Fire, Sitting Immobile with a Woman in One's Lap," and Tianchan's "Directly Inherited from Delin, Successor of the Tan School," each with its own style.</p>
<p>The above advertisements, because the Shen Bao newspaper in the past did not have the clean white paper of today and were all printed in No. 5 font, the advertising text was purely in the old-fashioned style, which cannot be compared to the diverse styles of today's advertising text.</p>
<h3>Entertainment News</h3>
<p>After performing for two weeks at the Tianchan Stage, the famous dan Huang Guiqiu left and will not continue. The theater sent Weng Xieyao yesterday on the Desheng ship to the north to bring the veteran laosheng and wusheng Liu Hanchen south to star in the new play "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights." The stage mechanisms and props for the play have been prepared and rehearsals will begin tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Sen Luo Dance Palace recently added famous Beijing ladies Yu Meishan, famous Beijing school beauty Lin Nanhua, contemporary famous star Chen Meiyan (also known as Little Sichuan), Bai Jieping (resembling Hu Die), etc., to its Red Star lineup. Recently, it also spent a lot of money to hire Miss Lin Da (Miss Linda) from Europe. She performs amazing techniques at the palace every night, so the audience has been crowded for days, and the scene is unprecedented. (Wang Lan)</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Opera World in the Old Capital (130)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Speaking of the Relationship between Empress Dowager Cixi and An Dehai Because of Visiting His Mother</p>
<p>This is also the downside of his youth and ignorance, relying on his merits to be arrogant. After Ding Baozhen beheaded Little Anzi, he also displayed the corpse for three days to quell the rumors. Some people also said that he first cut off An Dehai's small head, and then chopped off his big head, using this to cover up the scandal for Empress Dowager Cixi. Later, the Empress Dowager understood everything, and thought that since her lover was dead anyway, she might as well learn to be a generous ruler. Not only did she not punish Old Ding, but she also promoted him to Governor-General of Sichuan. In those days, among the officials serving outside the capital, the Governor-General was the most respected, and the Governor-General of Sichuan was considered the best position. In those years, Duan Fang, who had become the Governor-General of Liangjiang, was still not satisfied and was willing to spend 300,000 yuan to buy the position of Governor-General of Sichuan for fun. Who knew that he was killed by revolutionary martyrs on the way, before he reached his post. Ding Baozhen caused a great disaster, but instead received the best position, which he never dreamed of.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I heard a Cantonese opera record of "Empress Dowager Cixi Sacrificing to An Dehai." The lyrics were very sad and touching, which shows that their romantic affair was widely spread in the early years. Gubeikou was the starting point of their love affair. "Visiting His Mother" is a very popular play nowadays, and the border crossing in this play is also Gubeikou, so I specially combined these two things into one. As for the situation of Si Lang and An Dehai crossing the border, one stole the Empress Dowager Xiao's command arrow, and when he arrived at the border, he still acted grandly and sang four lines of Yaoban leisurely, warning the guards not to be lazy and not to be fooled by the southern barbarians disguising themselves. In fact, he was pretending, and he was talking about himself. Therefore, Yang Si Lang can be considered to have sneaked across the border. Speaking of Little Anzi, he was different from Si Lang. He clearly carried the Empress Dowager Cixi's secret decree, but he did not mention crossing the border. When he was saying goodbye to the guards, he learned a method of "pursuing by seeming to let go," and suddenly rushed in. Therefore, he was someone who forced his way through the border. Sneaking across is civilized, and forcing one's way through is impolite. As for the scene of robbing the border that has been performed recently, I am afraid that it is even more advanced and has become barbaric.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of the Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs</h3>
<p>— By Huang Hanrui</p>
<p>Resisting oppression, overthrowing autocracy, and not hesitating to pay the price of blood and flesh, this great spirit is worthy of our admiration. The Yellow Flower Mound battle resulted in the deaths of seventy-two martyrs, who achieved benevolence but not success, but undoubtedly this was the main force in overthrowing the Qing government. The Wuchang Uprising in 1911 established the Republic of China, which was the result of the martyrs' bloodshed. To admire the martyrs, we must commemorate them for:</p>
<p>(1) A Profound Sense of National Concept - Ordinary people only know about family and discard the concept of society and country. The martyrs could see the bigger picture. They could see that when the country was about to perish due to the corruption of the Qing court, they had no choice but to risk their lives in the battlefield of gunfire and bullets with the oppressors.</p>
<p>(2) Abundant Sacrificial Spirit - The sacrificial spirit of the martyrs is heavier than Mount Tai. They can abandon their own happiness for the sake of the masses. Their unyielding and relentless efforts are our model.</p>
<p>(3) Innovative Thinking - The corrupt Qing court was really too old and decayed. If it existed, the result would be the destruction of China. The martyrs had a new position and had to overthrow this outdated rule. They were standing at the forefront of the times.</p>
<p>(4) The Truthfulness of Their Emotions - We can see from the martyrs' farewell letters to their parents and wives and children that they are all tearful. Comforting parents and encouraging sons to continue the revolutionary work they had not completed are all lingering and emotional. They certainly had strong reason, but also rich emotions. This is a good example for today's youth.</p>
<p>It has been twenty-eight years since the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound were martyred. Today, during the War of Resistance, recalling the past, the course of struggle is so difficult. Here, we must continue the spirit of the martyrs to shoulder the unprecedented task of national liberation and achieve the final victory, so that we will not fail today's commemoration.</p>
<h3>The Story of Yellow Flower Mound</h3>
<p>— By Lu Lishi</p>
<p>If we go to Guangzhou, we must visit the Yellow Flower Mound under Baiyun Mountain. The white stone tomb and iron railings are dominated by a stone pavilion. In the stone pavilion, there is a stele, which reads "Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs." Behind the tomb, there is a memorial arch, and behind that, there is a large stone pavilion, which is magnificently built. Our President Sun Yat-sen wrote the words "The Spirit of Righteousness Endures Forever" in this pavilion, and above the pavilion stands a goddess of freedom.</p>
<p>When we walk here, we will think of the heroic and tragic story of the seventy-two martyrs: This happened in the third year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty. Many revolutionary comrades demanded national freedom, so on March 29th, under the guidance of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, they took pistols and bombs and carried out the tenth revolution, setting out to attack the Guangzhou Governor-General's Yamen.</p>
<p>At that time, Huang Xing was appointed commander, leading the bomb squad, rushing into the city, advancing into the governor's office, killing the enemy's street team to death, the escapees fled, the momentum was huge, and the enemies were terrified.</p>
<p>To catch the bandits, you must first catch the king. General Huang intended to capture Governor-General Zhang Mingqi. While searching, a large Qing army came to the rescue. They knew that the enemy was numerous and their own people were few, so they could not win. However, in order to arouse the revolutionary thinking of their compatriots, they disregarded their own lives and fought with the Qing soldiers. As a result, they killed hundreds of Qing soldiers, but the revolutionary comrades, because the rear was not contacted, some were martyred at the time, and some were captured by the Qing soldiers and became martyrs. In addition to General Huang, who was shot in the hands and feet but still led the remnants to kill, a total of seventy-two martyrs tragically sacrificed for the revolution.</p>
<p>After their deaths, Mr. Pan Dawei buried their bodies together under the Yellow Flower Mound of Baiyun Mountain in the east of Guangzhou, which became the only glorious memorial place in our country.</p>
<h3>The Eating Skills of Big Mouth</h3>
<p>— By Jiang Xiaoliu, a 13-year-old painter</p>
<h3>Diligent in Action, Cautious in Speech</h3>
<p>— By Shan Shixiong</p>
<p>"Diligent in action, cautious in speech" is a profound saying.</p>
<p>"Action" means the meaning of doing. We often hear the phrase "consistency between words and deeds," but in reality, many people "say one thing and do another" or "do one thing and say another." Such people's lofty talks, even if they are good at it, no matter how loud their words are, no matter how arrogant their talks are, because their consciousness is not correct, or what they do cannot adapt to reality, therefore, nothing can be successful. There are also many people who just bury their heads in hard work. Although they rarely speak at ordinary times, the results of what these people do are often successful. For example, Stalin of the Soviet Union suffered many great setbacks more than a decade ago, but he was able to be diligent in action and cautious in speech, coupled with a spirit of hard work and courage, so after his two five-year plan of struggle, he has now made the Soviet Union a rich and strong country. Another example is our President Chiang Kai-shek. He is careful in handling military and political affairs. Before doing anything, he has already had a plan in mind, so he can now be called the leader of resisting the enemy and reviving the country.</p>
<p>If we can earnestly do what the ancients said, "diligent in action, cautious in speech," then we can get many benefits in our lives, and we will certainly have considerable achievements in our studies and careers.</p>
<p>"Too much talk leads to mistakes." The explanation of this sentence is that if a person talks too much, he will inevitably make mistakes. However, in my opinion, this sentence is not necessarily correct. Because I think that a person should speak as much as possible of what he wants to say and should say, but before buying, he must think about it, then this kind of person can become great.</p>
<p>From this point of view, a person's words and deeds must be "diligent" and "cautious," and to achieve extraordinary careers and learning, one must also develop a habit of "diligent in action and cautious in speech."</p>
<h3>Chatting</h3>
<p>— By Bai Zheng</p>
<p>——Ming'er's Escape Diary Seventeen——</p>
<p>Smooth sailing is the most welcome thing in the minds of boatmen. It saves effort and is fast. But Ming'er's boat was sailing upstream on the Qiantang River, so of course there was no hope of smooth sailing, so they just hoped for the only fair wind day and night. That morning, the sky was not very helpful, with a small headwind, but in the afternoon, the wind direction changed somehow, and gusts of wind blew from the stern, so the boatmen were overjoyed and hurriedly hung a large sail on the tall mast. The sail was urged by the wind, and it seemed to increase the power of the boat a lot, and it finally overcame its resistance and suddenly accelerated the speed of the boat. The faces of the boatmen also seemed to be covered with a layer of joy, and they each took their pipes to the stern to smoke. The boat boss (the boatmen call him "Captain," as a sign of respect) was also smoking at the bow. Ming'er came out of the dull cabin at this time to get some fresh air. He saw the boat boss sitting there very得意 at the moment, so he had many questions in his heart to ask him, taking advantage of this good opportunity.</p>
<p>"Captain, how far did we travel today?" Ming'er asked him with some "rotten" Mandarin. "Today, guess." The boat boss refused to answer him. "Twenty or thirty miles?" "Yes," Ming'er was happy in his heart, thinking that he had guessed correctly, but later he realized that it was not. Ming'er's intelligence was originally very superstitious on the boat. If the boat is sailing in a fair wind, you must not ask how far the boat has traveled. If you ask this question, the fair wind will not blow for long. Ming'er secretly laughed at their superstition. However, these few words opened their conversation box, and Ming'er asked questions endlessly.</p>
<p>"How many years has this boat been built? How much money? Where are you from? How many days will it take to get to Tunxi?" A string of questions like this pressed the boat boss to answer, so that Ming'er's father in the boat cabin was also secretly laughing.</p>
<p>"I am from Fuyang. It's not far from here. I have been following my father on the boat since I was a child, growing up and starting a family. I have been eating on the boat for more than thirty years. The food on the boat is not tasty. No matter what day, what weather, whether it's raining or hot, you have to pole the boat. Just imagine the scorching sun in June shining on our backs, it seems to be burning, and blisters on the back are commonplace, sometimes they even fester. In the cold weather, we still have to work barefoot, in the ice water, on the snow. I am afraid of eating this kind of hard food. I want to find some other industries to do, but how can I do it with my clumsy body? I have to live one day as two and a half days. This boat has been built for more than seven years. We use it very carefully, so it still looks very new. The price of shipbuilding was cheaper at that time, and more than one hundred yuan was enough, but now it is not possible. The cost of repairing a boat is also very high. Every year, it has to be oiled with tung oil, and all the things in the cabin have to be decorated, so it is estimated that an extra twenty or thirty yuan has to be added to the small profit every year. Both of my brothers are boatmen. I'm not bragging, we also have a little reputation in Fuyang. This is because we do things honestly. Whether we transport goods or do business for customers, we are all honest and trustworthy. There is no fixed date to Tunxi. We rely on the sky to eat. It takes about half a month upstream, and if the wind is smooth, it can be reached in about ten days. And downstream, one week is enough." Ming'er listened to such a long paragraph with great interest. After the boat boss finished saying so much, he whistled, and Ming'er knew that he was urging the wind to blow quickly. "It's really funny, how can the wind be controlled by people?" He said secretly. He still wanted to continue asking, but his mother called him to have dinner, and as soon as he heard about eating, he turned around and walked into the cabin.</p>
<h3>Introducing a Group Studied at a Children's Research Institute</h3>
<p>— By Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the twentieth century is a world of science. The life of mankind in the twentieth century needs to live a scientific life. If we want to seek evolution for the world and create happiness for mankind, we must strive to study science. Only scientific children are the builders of the new world in the future and the creators of a new life for mankind!</p>
<p>Here, I want to introduce you to a children's science research group. That is a group of little friends who love science and nature, organized in June 6th, 1935. The initial number of participants was also sixty-six, so it was named the 66 Children's Science Research Association. The purpose they hold is: "To enable children to satisfy their desire for knowledge, to obtain the benefits of joint research, and to cultivate an interest and habit of studying science."</p>
<p>They were originally on the Beijing-Shanghai Line in Anting Town, and they were studying happily when, unexpectedly, the sound of cannons on August 12th interrupted their work, and its original address was lost. Now, some of the members have escaped from that evil environment and resumed their work in Shanghai, continuing their past spirit and developing their future glory.</p>
<p>During each semester, they convene all members to hold a general meeting once to discuss the progress of the association's affairs. A research meeting is held once a month. Sometimes the center of research is stipulated, or it is changed to a speech meeting, debate meeting, field observation, experimental performance, essay contest rewards and other activities. A "Scientific Children" issue is published every Saturday and is attached to the Children's Daily as a garden for members to research each other and report their experiences.</p>
<p>Their organization is divided into three departments: library, research, and publication, and has a president, a clerk, and a treasurer. There are currently more than 70 members, all wearing a plum blossom-shaped "66" association emblem. When joining the association, members must pay a membership fee of 20 cents, and then pay a regular fee of 20 cents per semester.</p>
<p>Now they plan to expand the organization and continue to solicit new members, preparing to mobilize the children of Shanghai to explore science together. All children aged 10 to 16, whether they are continuing their studies in elementary school or learning industrial arts and commerce, as long as they are interested in science, can join. This is a good opportunity for children to study science.</p>
<p>Respectable little friends: get up and study science! Make yourself a scientific child and build a new world and create a new life!</p>

<h3>Yellow Flower Mound Memorial Day</h3>
<p>— By Chen He, 6th Grade Student, Qinqun Elementary School</p>
<p>The whole sadness, oppression, suppressed my joy, and added that ruthless half-mast flag, fluttering in the universe, making people unusually desolate and full of emotion.</p>
<p>Opening a page of history twenty-eight years ago, I only saw artillery fire in Guangzhou, blood and flesh flying, it was truly a human tragedy and a hell on earth.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no success on a certain scale, but their spirit and their perseverance are worthy of our admiration and admiration!</p>
<p>They sacrificed for the ancestors of the past, for the grandchildren of the future, and for the country, but it was also glorious and skillful.</p>
<p>They have already sacrificed for the country. We should cultivate good thoughts, exercise a good physique, take the seventy-two martyrs as examples, become the backbone of future society, the pillars of the country, resist the armed invaders, and move towards the bright road, to win the glory of the nation.</p>
<h3>Flying a Kite</h3>
<p>— By Yang Yi, 5th Grade Student, Shanghai Elementary School</p>
<p>Alas, it's time to fly kites again every year. But when can I go home and fly it in the countryside?</p>
<p>I remember when I was in my hometown in the past, I made an appointment with my neighbors to fly kites in the field. We took the line and ran east and west, and the kite also floated in the air with us. Suddenly, a storm came, the line broke, and the kite flew elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thinking back to those years, it was really happy. But what about today? I can't go home. I raise my head and look at the sky. Only silver planes are shining in the sunlight. Where can I find the trace of kites?</p>
<p>Children! When can we fly kites!</p>
<h3>Methods of Writing</h3>
<p>— By Xu Xiuxin, 6th Grade Student, Hui Elementary School</p>
<p>Dear children, we are Chinese, and we should practice Chinese characters very well. Of course, there are many people who practice well, but the posture is not right. Now I will briefly write it down below.</p>
<p>Chinese characters are roughly divided into seven types: (1) Ancient Script, (2) Great Seal Script, (3) Small Seal Script, (4) Clerical Script, (5) Cursive Script, (6) Regular Script, (7) Running Script. Now I am talking about the sixth type, Regular Script, so I will first talk about the method of writing Regular Script. In the past, there were three methods of writing: (1) Tracing, (2) Reflecting Characters, (3) Copying. Now I am talking about copying from rubbings. There are five methods of copying: (1) Penmanship, Penmanship is divided into three types: (1) Suspended Wrist Method, (2) Elbow Movement Method, (3) Leaning Wrist Method, (1) Posture, face the front, keep the torso straight, place both arms flat, keep the wrist parallel to the table, and keep the right arm and left arm at right angles. There are two types of brush tips: middle tip and side tip. Grind the ink flat and slowly.</p>
<p>We use the elbow movement method for medium regular script, and the wrist movement method for small regular script. The brush tip must use the middle tip.</p>
<h3>My Dead Mother</h3>
<p>— By Xia Ziliang, 5th Grade Student, Minsheng Elementary School</p>
<p>In a quiet black night, suddenly my heart was filled with pessimistic and terrifying thoughts. So I recalled my dearest mother.</p>
<p>When I was eight years old, my mother left me. How heartbroken! Every day I see many children calling out to their dear mothers, but I will never have a mother again.</p>
<h3>Snow White (12)</h3>
<p>— Grandson of Heaven</p>
<p>That night in the seven dwarfs' little house, they were having a jolly time. What were they so busy with? They were busy with a social gathering, everyone was high-spirited and extremely happy.</p>
<p>So they began to hold a celebration. Grumpy found a small fiddle in a dark corner of the room, engraved with birds and frogs. He pulled the strings with both hands, playing a series of forest melodies. The other dwarfs also had their own original musical instruments, harmonizing and singing with Grumpy's playing, enjoying themselves immensely. After singing, they put down their instruments and started to dance. Their strange and interesting steps were also of their own creation. Not only did they dance themselves, but they also took turns dancing with Snow White. After all seven dwarfs had danced, she collapsed into a chair, completely out of breath, but her heart was filled with joy.</p>
<p>Just then, the clock's door burst open, and a metal cuckoo jumped out, calling "cuckoo, cuckoo" ten times in a row. Snow White hurriedly sat up and said, "Oh, it's long past the designated bedtime! You all should go upstairs to sleep now!"</p>
<p>But the seven dwarfs refused to go, insisting on giving their beds to Snow White to sleep in. Snow White couldn't persuade them otherwise, so she had to go upstairs. As she reached the top of the stairs, they were still looking up at her and shouting, "We wish you a good night's sleep and sweet dreams!" When Snow White arrived in the bedroom, she knelt down and prayed, wishing God to bless the seven dwarfs, because they were so good to her. Finally, she added, "And please do me a special favor, and make Grumpy change too, and become just like me!" At that time, the queen, disguised as an old grocery-selling woman, was preparing to set off to the seven dwarfs' place. She packed a basket of sundry goods, and carefully placed the poisoned apple on top, to avoid making a mistake at the last minute. Finally, she bid farewell to her beloved raven, and said to it, "My dear, the next time you see me, I will no longer be so old and ugly. From tonight onwards, I will once again be stunningly beautiful, the most beautiful woman in the world! And that little Snow White will be buried alive, ending her little life!"</p>
<p>At the time when dawn was breaking, the queen stumbled out of the tunnel, truly a hideous old woman. Under the palace, there was a black stream, flowing tortuously like a snake. She untied the mooring rope of a small boat tied to the shore, picked up a punt pole, and began to pole downstream in the foggy sky.</p>
<p>After poling for a while, she saw the stream flowing into the forest, clearly reaching her destination. The queen moored the boat to the shore, jumped ashore, and tiptoed towards the seven dwarfs' little house.</p>
<p>That morning, the seven dwarfs, because they went to bed late last night, got up later than usual. They always went to bed very early every night, never going to bed after ten o'clock in their lives. Snow White got up first, and made them a hot and delicious breakfast, standing at the door, handing them seven small buns, which turned out to be seven meat buns.</p>
<p>Doctor first warned Snow White, "No matter who it is, you must not let them into this house. Because that queen is an extremely cunning woman, and may come up with some tricks to deal with you."</p>
<p>Snow White hurriedly said, "Don't worry, nothing will happen to me."</p>
<p>Grumpy chimed in, "I must also warn you, that queen is capable of anything, you better be careful!"</p>
<p>The seven dwarfs said goodbye to Snow White and went out to work. Just as their seven figures disappeared in the distance, the little animals immediately gathered around, leading Snow White to the currant bushes near the house, picking a bucket of fresh currants, and started making currant buns.</p>
<p>She baked seven small currant buns by the stove, engraving the names of the seven dwarfs on each bun, in a curly and beautiful font. The little animals watched from the side, praising her with admiration.</p>
