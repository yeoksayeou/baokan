<h3>美國新中立法與遠東</h3>
<p>美國新中立法案，通過於參衆兩院，業已由羅斯福總統簽署，立即生效而成為美國法律。這决羅斯福總統不斷與其國內的孤立派奮鬥，達到了修改中立法的目的，不問這决成功，是由於美國民衆同情民治國家乃以廢止軍火禁運條款，予英法以向美購買的便利，抑亦因美國民衆由於雅典尼亞號的被擊沉，其中有美國旅客，弗林特城號的被俘獲，這是美國商船，此類糾紛，有使美國牽入戰爭的危險；故通過新中立法，使美國總統有權禁止美輪美人，進入戰區。由這决新中立法的通過，可以證明羅斯福的政策，獲得美國民衆廣大的擁護，而總統的力量、也足以控制兩院。當此美國行政首領威望日隆的時候；就中國方面來講，自然希望美國在太平洋方面的行動，如白崇禧將軍所謂「不僅僅空談九國公的之門戶開放政策，而必須進一步中止軍用原料之售與日本。」因為這種舉動對於中國最為有利，然而這却不能求之於新中立法案中。新中立法的通過，雖便利民治國家購買軍火，而其適用範圍，也只限於歐洲，不適用於遠東。可是遠東也已經有兩年三個月的大規模戰爭存在，這戰爭雖是不宣而戰，可是有其重耍性及其特殊性。中國的抗戰，是反侵略戰；同時中國是個重工業落後的國家，在軍需的供給上，武器的添置上，在在都需要同情中國抗戰的國家援助，就美國而論，雖未便對某某國家的待遇，有所軒輊，但就道義上講，美國實有維護公允反抗不公允，保護被侵略者反抗侵略者的義務。這决禁運軍火條款取銷，使擁有海軍優勢及大量商船的英法等民治國家，可以用現款向美國購買大量重要作戰武器，在原則上，美國是對歐洲各交戰國不偏不倚的；然而在精神上，却是無形中援助其同一政體的民治國家，而予法西侵略國家一個重大打擊。所以禁運軍火條款的取銷，實行所謂現款購買與自運政策，我伍可以肯定的說，是對於西歐民治國家是絕對有利的。但對於遠東方面，其情形恰相反。中國需要自海外輸入軍火，已如上述。可是中國的海軍與商輸，簡直等於零。這樣一來，日本可以向美購買武器，實行自運，以便利其侵略中國，而中國却無法購運軍火。新中立法中，雖有我們理解修正中立法的本意，並非予遠東的侵略國以便利，而予中國的抗戰以打擊；但是美國對於遠東，對於中國，僅此消極的「並無惡意」是不夠的。必須有更積極的行勸，發揮美國的正議精神。</p>
<p>也許現總統羅斯福所採取的政策，是與故總統西沃陀羅斯福一樣，行動是遲緩的，手中的「大棍」却握着。大海軍的擴張，夏威夷關鳥阿留申羣島的設防，巴拿瑪太平洋各島嶼的空軍根據地的設立，種種軍事上攻勢的建立，隨同着外交上的攻勢；如過去一再重申門戶開放，近來的由其外交使節的發表維護在華權益的談話，及目前美駐日大使復有備忘錄交與日外相野村，對於日本的經濟排外主義，損害美國的權益，表示極為憤懣。外面盛傳美國對日將實行經濟制裁，這傳說雖經當局吾認，可是美國為維護其傳統的對華權益，恢復世界和平計，僅僅外交上的表示與行動。殆不足以遏止瘋狂的侵略；大約祇有實行經濟制裁，纔是切實有效的方法。我伍深知美國有種種內在的原因，使他的行動不得不緩慢；又深知美國必循序措施，以迄於貫徹其遏止侵略的遠東政策；故我伍雖期望美國採行有效的方法，但並非亟亟迫不及待。水到渠成，必有其日，抑且深知其期不在遠。至以目前而論，却以為美國在修正中立法之後，遠東未經認為戰爭狀態存在之時，極應儘量運用新中立法所留的餘地，由美國商輪裝載軍火，供給中國。大量的軍火有大用，小量的軍火亦有小用；然其意義猶不在量之大小，而在象徵着美國貫澈其遠東政策的決心</p>

<h3>戰時歐洲進行曲（續）</h3>
<p>— 倫敦特約通信　叔棣</p>
<p>這種最理想情勢的實現，在波蘭方面，我們可以替牠起個名稱，那是：「富貴兩全」。</p>
<p>很明顯，這是一種非常冒險的戰略！萬一這一估計落了空呢？於是，針對着，波蘭就有牠的第二個戰略，那是，用一個杜撰的名稱：「禍中得福」</p>
<p>希特拉於進攻波蘭前不久，曾在大聲地恫嚇着波蘭：「如果波蘭再這麽下去，恐怕這一個二十多年的新國家，要寫牠歷史的最後一章了。」誠然，希特拉最巧妙的，是「略戰而勝」；不過，萬一略戰而不勝之後，他下了一個最大決心，去消滅波蘭的話，那末，除掉其他國際變化外，以軍力而論，一班人都公認，他是可以達到的。這樣，在波蘭方面，不能不算是暫時的災禍。然而，也分明地認淸了這個可能，而毅然背起犧牲的十字架，不惜於最大災禍中，企求最後福利的，却是波蘭當局們這一次終於應戰的最高打算。</p>
<p>波蘭約估計，德國於攻下但澤及「走廊」後，如果不能終結戰爭，牠的第二步驟，當然是進攻華沙，企圖訂城下之盟。那樣塲合下，波蘭準備不惜於最後放棄牠的都城，繼續地和德國戰了下去。所以，波蘭的第二道也是最重要的一道防綫，却在華沙以東，沿著維斯杜拉河·柏格河。以及杉河等流域。粗粗地劃起來，大概是由東普魯士東邊的奧格斯都起，經柏立斯杜克，經德布林，一直到克拉科。波蘭的估計，德國最多限度，絕對不能越過這一道綫，假如牠不願意和蘇聯衝突的話。何况，即使在這樣一道綫上，戰起來時，那時，感受到小安的，巳經不僅是，波蘭本身了；在南邊，有羅馬尼亞等國，在東邊，有蘇聯，在北面，又有波羅的海各國。這些國家，到那時，自然要紛紛地起來，對抗德國的躍進。</p>
<p>而且，在西歐，牠有著同盟國的英·法·兩强！</p>
<p>當然，在那時，大戰是絕對的爆發了。這樣一個大戰裏，波蘭相信，德國一定會最後的戰敗。所以縱使在過程中，波蘭會遭受犧牲，但最後，在一個參戰國處置戰敗國——德國——的會議席上，波蘭一定是一個主要的分子，而，在處分德國未來領土時，波蘭還可以分到一點德國的領土利益。那時，但澤歸併入波蘭，當然不成問題；東普魯士也當然歸併；甚至，如果可能，還可以伸展勢力到德國本部的境內，一直到奧德河以東的各地。</p>
<p>假設第一個理想實現，那末，歐洲未來的第一等强國，是英·法·蘇·德·意·波·六國，如果第二個理想實現，那末，未來的第一等强國，是英·法·蘇·波·（意大利的是吾仍為第一等强國，當以牠參加那一面為定）等國。波蘭今天的當局，在這樣計算着。</p>
<p>這裏要附帶說明一句：波蘭的當局，是不相信意大利會在一個大戰裏，始終和德國不分手的；並且，如果意大利也和德國共同戰下去，那末，牠的命運，也當和德國一樣的，同被擊敗。</p>
<p>對於蘇聯，雖是有了「蘇德互不侵犯協定」的簽定，波蘭不相信牠會袖手旁觀到底，無諭如何，軍火的應援——至少是買賣——是絕對可以的。一直到這一回大戰的前夕，牠頂不放心的，還是英國的態度。所以當英國表示絕對履行互助協定到底，公佈了協定條文時，這時，波蘭感到，牠是可以放心一戰了。還有對於巴爾幹半島各國，允其是羅馬尼亞，牠以為是絕對不能坐視波蘭的敗潰。並且，在英·法·參戰情形下，在蘇聯援助波蘭時，牠以為，以羅·土·兩國為首領的所有巴爾幹半島各國，大多數會自動地起來，加入英·法·波·聯軍的這一面。（如果意大利助德，也許南斯拉夫會成為唯一的例外）巴爾幹這一集團的力量如何呢？一般估計，大概有六百萬左右！</p>
<p>正因為波蘭這一回應戰的抱負和決心，是這樣的徹頭徹尾，所以，當英·法·對德一宜了戰時，以波蘭屈服為內容的，德·波·中途妥協的門，是最後地關閉了！今而後，波蘭是踏上了以國運為孤注一擲的路！（九月六日）　（完）</p>
<h3>犯粵日艦　結集雷州半島沿岸　妄圖侵犯粤南</h3>

<h3>蘇州　各街巷裝栅門　日軍恐華軍襲擊</h3>

<p>又二日晨迄午二時、日軍突在城廂內外、聚急戒嚴、並禁止行人車輛通行、至戒嚴之原因、因日方拒絕宜佈、無從探悉、據一般猜測、大的與近日常州戰事有關、</p>
<p>教育消息</p>
<h3>在艱難困苦中　晋系敎育積極推進　在砲火下建立六七百小學　為適應需要小學改四年制</h3>
<p>（晋西通訊）晋西第六行政區十縣雖淪陷已逾一載、但對於敎育事業仍繼續推行、不遺餘力、茲將該區敎育現狀分誌如次、</p>
<p>學校敎育</p>
<p>第六行政區、因為在地理上所處的形勢最偏僻、交通非常閉塞不便、過去敎育不很發達、只在臨汾和隰縣的城內、設立有中學校、最近在這個區域成立六區區立中學、內分高初兩級、便是目前晋西的最高學府、一共有三百來個學生、去年十一月一日、巳經開始上課、另外在六區河（汾）東辦事處附近、設立了一所分校、敎育河東各縣的靑年、在汾西的某地也正籌備着開辦一個分校、打算訓練開展國防工業的技術人才、主要的還是小學敎育、平均每縣的每區、都有一所兩級小學、每個鄕村裏有三四所初級小學、全區在砲火下建立起來的小學、目前共有六七百處、還在不斷的增加着、比起一些敎育發達的地方、這個數目還少得很、因為六區一共十個縣、但要知道這裹便是文化敎育極其落後的地區、今天又處在特殊地困難條件之下、六區一共包括了這十個縣、臨汾·洪洞·趙城·霍縣·靈石·汾西·隰縣·蒲縣·永和·大寗·比較起來、前邊沿着同蒲鐵路的五個縣裏、成績是最好的、這一方面是由於這裏本來的文化水平就比較的高、學校就原來比別的地方多、各級小學的課程、除了必須三民主義等外、最主要的是國語讀本算術課本、常識課本三種、另外還有防空防毒知識、軍事訓練、唱歌等課程、並且唱救亡歌曲、佔有不少的時間、敎材多是適應當地的情况、一律重新編印的、有的石印、有的用油印、因為印刷的困難、目前各地敎育還沒有完全統一起來、現在六區行政督察專員公署、正用石印加緊大量的印刷中、這裏所以另行編印敎材、一則外地編印的敎材、多不適合於目前的具體情况的需要、二則、戰區郵路的限制、不能自後方大批的運寄、按着本區的特殊環境及實際情况、抗戰的形勢和需要、他們把小學修業年限、暫時共合改定為四年、初小二年、高小二年、但是有個時間、若果工作上需要、而且學生成績特別好的話、也可以隨時的介紹給以救亡的工作、或提前升至中學、成績不很好的、也可以退去他們學習時間、</p>
<p>幾個特點</p>
<p>這裏所實施的新敎育、有幾個特點、第一把全部敎材都與今日的抗戰建國工作、所得密切的連系、製造抗戰建國的內容、就是算術、也都是敎小學生洋馬·飛機·大砲數目、加强兒童的民族意識、第二、學校當局不給學生以任同的無理束縛、不禁止學生的各種有利於抗戰的活動、並且還在各方領導學生的救亡及各種活動、建立民主自動的作風、第三、取消了過去對於學生打駡的刑罰制度、免除那種不合理的管敎、消除過去學生對敎師的隔膜·仇恨·和畏懼心理、敎師和學生的生活打成一片、第四、適合着抗戰建國期間特殊的困難的環境、建立吃苦耐勞的作風敎師們沒有很好的敎室和桌椅、有時都在野外的地下進行功課的講授、第五、他們充分發揚了集體學習的精神、學習較好的學生、在課外還是自動的過集體生活、組織小組會、講演會、唱歌隊等、第六、把學習和實踐連系起來、一般小學生在學習後、大多即組織宜傳隊等、下鄕工作、或者帮助村自衛隊站崗放哨、盤查行人等活動、第七、在學校裏一般的都把童軍訓練、改作較為嚴格軍事、訓練、也是這兒童敎育的重要特點之一、</p>
<p>社會敎育</p>
<p>特別是自開始恢復各級政權的時間起、幹部的訓練、也成為一種很重要的敎育工作、這些訓練多是短期的、在各級政府所舉辦的幹部訓練班最多、性質也分行政、敎育·村長·閭長·村自衛隊等好多種類、這是植部訓練主要目的、即在可培擇選拔新的幹部、改造落後的或脆弱的幹部、統一幹部的政治認識、和新的工作作風、社會敎育的工作、開展的比較遲緩、不過大家都巳經異常注意這種工作一般的、多是用民校識字班、羣衆團體的小組織來推行的、並且輔以公演話劇、歌詠等的方式，</p>

<p>匯豐掛牌均猛長</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條豐及美銀價均休業無電豐倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·對法均平、對滬長一二五、美對英縮二分二五、對滬大一角三分、對法小一分半、中央掛脾各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五辦士五六二五、美匯九元一八七五、較之上週末、英平美緊〇六二五、乃匯兌下縮之故、開後香港來電傾塞、且本市投機家猛烈拋空、兼浮多斬結、加以外行吃胃奇淡、未隔半小時、英金竟長至五辦士八七五、美匯亦硬達九元七五、其間匯豐有利某行等外行在鬆價時均有吃進、匯豐掛牌揭曉、英金長半辦士、美匯大八一二五、白銀平衡稅揭曉勿動、此後日行突趁賤扒結、同時匯豐及某美行亦有買胃、致巿勢頓見回軟、九時五十分、英金已軟至五辦士五六二五、美匯亦緊達九元一二五、嗣因華商復起賣風、且買方吃胃轉呆、故重趨鬆硬、英金再硬至五辦士七一八七五、美匯又鬆達九元四三七五、旋以匯豐乘機再吸、日行又來力扒、並聞港電亦有復進、是以又見回軟、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金巳軟至五辦士五三一二五、美匯亦縮至九元一二五、聞收後英金又軟至五辦士半、美滙再緊達九元〇六二五、</p>
<p>後士狀况略轉定</p>
<p>後巿初因匯豐大通某行等外行續有納胃、且聞日行與港電仍有扒進、故市勢又緊至五辦士三七五、及八元八七五、後以買風稍息、且華商重有吐出、故狀態略定、結果晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士四三七五、美滙九元、本月份英金五辦士四二一八七五、美滙八元九六八七五、比上週現期、英均緊一二五、美俱軟二五、</p>

<p>天津美滙出九元</p>
<p>天津六日電、今晨滙巿開盤趨硬、英美匯均見放長、英匯現貨猛鬆二八一二五、為五便士六二五、美滙現貨在長三七五、為九元二角半、申匯不動、仍開一百元零五角、「聯鈔」暗盤微昂二角五分、為九十四元，</p>
<h3>美票兎起鶻落　晨間跌至十元四角半　午後漲達十一元三角</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、變動甚劇、初承上週六鬆濫、英美金鎊、供給頗殷、市况甚弱、英美金票、拋塞暢爽、市價急降、美金票曾跌至十元零四角五分、惟市價下跌過多、易起投機吸納、未幾外滙緊張、烚赤回升、英美金票、需要旺盛、市價猛升、午後美金票昂至十一元三角、及晚漲風漸戢、晚市為十一元零三分、香港票安南票、供求較稀、結果微軟、日金票需要未盛、市况虛弱、晚市為一元二角八分一厘、朝鮮票亦趨疲乏、晚巿為一元零九分五厘、昨日市價、英美金鎊、俱降一元、英金票結果未動、美金票獨升七分、香港票降九分、安南票降五分、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>

<h3>金市上落狂暴　港帮吃胃突吿轉淡　最低達三三七〇元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、悲慘之象、未嘗變更、緣外匯之繼續暴鬆、致使幾個向抱多頭思想之買戶、裹足不前、且港帮吃胃因運輸關係、突吿轉淡、但午刻滙市告緊後、亦未見回高、反背道而馳、可見金巿已病入膏肓、無藥可醫、初開賣風極濃、浮多競相斬結、即做小數十元、為三千四百七十元、嗣因外匯鬆勢益銳、再猛撳至三千三百七十元低盤、旋尙反應、外滙回軟、而人心一振、某金號及某錢兌業力吸遂回高達三千四百八十元、午收為三千四百三十元、午後首因證券帮等搜扒、及其時滙巿亦軟、曾高達三千五百〇五元頂價、頃刻外匯又硬、金號等拋塞小至三千四百三十五元、惟結果外匯雖反緊、但收盤祇三千四百六十元、較上週末午收竟又軋小六十元、若比上日塲外亦軋跌四十元之譜、全天交易大旺、的三千數百兩、銀樓飾金倏上倐落、終則小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤結果跌六十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開人心非常虛疲、賣者叫集、首由某錢兌業喊三千五百元賣出但隔手某現金號售予某金號十兩、為三千叫百七十元作開盤價、較上日塲外的撳小三十元之譜、少頃某現金號冉塞予某金號十兩、又猛撳三十元、為三千四百四十元、此後聞外匯鬆勢愈厲、賣氣瀰漫、銀樓帮與證券帮及錢兌業爭先傾吐、但其時買方多作旁觀、價又一瀉五十五元、破入三千四百元關內、錢兌業售予金號三十兩、為三千三百八十五元、時某金號乘機猛進、一度曾回至三千四百元、終因賣者過多、再降小至三千三百七十元、嗣因外匯止鬆回軟、人心一振、某錢兌業頓反出為進、力吸數百兩、同時散戶亦來跟進、立回一百十元、錢兌業吐予金號二十兩、為三千四百八十元、旋以外匯鬆動、賣風復起、某金號獲利復出、且現金號與證券帮等亦競相塞出、故價又不支、暴落一百〇五元、金號互做二十兩為三千七百七十五元、共時外滙再吿回緊、遂又引起買風、某金號與某錢兌業又互相收買、同時證券帮亦獲利補空、故不久即回起七十五元、證券帮進金號十兩、為三千四百五十元、後另一錢兌業吐出數十兩、遂撳低二十元、為三千四百三十元作午收價、午後初開因外滙緊軟、即抬高十七元、錢兌業進證券帮二十兩、為三千四百四十七元、繼因證券帮及錢兌業等收買、續漲五十八元、錢兌業進金號十兩、為三千五百〇五元、後某余號突獲利吐出、兼錢兌業時代客拋塞、且外匯轉硬、貿方缺乏興趣、故又傾瀉七十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、為三千四百三十五元、入後某銀號及錢兌業等塌便宜買進、遂回升三十元、銀樓帮進金號二十兩、為三千四百六十五元、後某金號又吐予證券帮三十兩、為三千四百六十元作晚收價、結果比上週六午收軋跌六十元、查巳連小五天、共計二百六十五元、全天一百三十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進須减低二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元之譜、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金懸三百五十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百五十五元、迨至九時四十分掛小五元、逾五分又小五元、十一時〇五分回升五元、十一時四十五分復低五元、十二時一刻重回起五元、下午二時五十五分又回起五元、三時二十分重掛小五元、結果軋小五元、計大同行改懸三百五十元、新同行與上價相同、收進的减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>證券　由多翻空　統甲大跌　外股亦大有起伏</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日趨勢、忽由數度盤旋後、跌風加厲塲內賣氣驟盛、高低差額有一元之鉅、環境固無良好消息、但亦無顯著不利之謠言、因大戶多頭出脫後、翻空者頗不乏人、故不惜造謠、對散戶多頭加以威脅、是以外匯繼長、金子大跌、而公債毫無好面、以前向與公債背道而馳者、今則同出一轍、　以前外匯忽長忽短、係隨和平空氣為消長、今則因某方在塞、完全是供求關係、故與公債毫不相涉、前途再有一度跌落、當起回風、昨日上午、初開在大通天生等買勢較旺時、市價堪稱堅穩、旋以三十五號及五號以及協大德孚永大等賣氣極盛、尤以三十五號為最湧、散戶乃亦粉紛求售、市價放鬆、丙種驟打破八元關、乙種亦進五十元大關、午前即小去數角至一元餘、午後形勢較定、買賣較稀、甲種略回堅、餘仍略小一二角、成交數約一百二十萬元之譜茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交國華銀行股六十股、價為三十九元半、</p>
<p>昨日下午衆業公所股市開盤、蓬勃非凡、瑞鎔股與耶松股再漲達十八元半與二百零四元之新高價、會德豐股亦上升室六十四元半、適屆交易中程、巿塲突有大批獲利者出而活動、多方對此勇猛拋售、抵抗甚力、故所有了結、多被吸收、收盤時仍甚堅定、由於實業股方面活躍過甚、債券與橡皮股二者未免遜色、多少被人忽視矣、</p>
<h3>糧食　新米大量來滬　售盤繼跌元許　糯米到稀獨俏　客秈操縱堅穩</h3>
<p>杜粳　久吿斷貨之河下米、咋抵埠有松生及楓練等船十餘艘、而蘇嘉楓靑包子由車輪運到二十四五車、其中以粳米居多、故疲頹之粳米市氣、更難維持、客販心思旣餒、恐遭大損、都謀急脫、售意殊鬆、而一般本鄕作客、以為嗣後來源日增、益不敢多購、致交易愈淸、僅零星胃口、是以新粳及菉窰種百哥等行情、乃步步下游、至收市較前巿又跌六七角至一元左右、蘆羊尖僅有本街銷塲、受粳市影響、價亦續貶四五角不等、破礱巳屬落令、仍無做開、獨陰變元因邇來到貨時斷、棧存奇薄、在酒作坊突出動辦之下、頓呈活躍狀態、昨巿陡升一二元之巨、計開常帮特元二十九元、嘉善陰元亦開二十七元、</p>
<p>客秈　江北尖自上週一路轟動、在各路銷化暢旺之後、巿存更覺單薄、而產地與申市價尙難劃通、來源仍斷、故人心愈堅、本鄕作客旣續興濃、而一般囤戶尤屬活躍、造成貨主居奇、不肯輕脫、市價步佾、惟他貨繼跌之際、僅加二三角、收盤高貨為二十一元九角、市燕尖、當東行繼續停拋機會、尙堪依江北尖惹人注目、跟提一二角、收盤高貨為二十二元一角、統計全市成交客尖較粳米為多、共的六七千包、</p>
<h3>粉市沉靜　麥價仍堅</h3>
<p>粉交易、總吿淸閑、雖値週初之期、而本客去路、均為零星、客方因當地市價平常、辦興不濃、廠方則以原料價昂、始終不願輕脫、故市面擯持之下、漸覺沉靜、統市成交的計三萬包强、二號粉本盤續開七元四角、客盤砲車與紅藍車及天竹牌等均須七元五角、回籠貨供求兩少、概無正市、七日有粉三千包運天津、</p>
<p>小麥來源、併計不足萬包、目下各產區來源、迭受阻撓、執貨者售意甚堅、而廠方則以粉價難漲、亦不願放價吸收、統市祇福新廠辦進蘇錫等麥二千餘包、價與前盤相仿、尙有行囤方面做開十餘車、較前價升七八分、蘇州麥最高價為十一元六角八分、次至十一元四角、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油操縱　再抬半元</h3>
<p>昨日豆油行情、又復抬頭、全由操縱家所支配、價比上週末、不論桶裝簍油一致續升半元、計開大連油一百二十桶、價自六十六元三角、提至六十六元五角、神戶油三十桶、價為六十六元八角、膠州油二百件、價為四十七元、烟岐油五百件、價為四十九元、靑歧油一百五十三件、價為四十八元五角、花生油雖得　帮蟬聯、但潛勢平庸、成交膠州油一百件、價為五十四元原價、及江北聽裝油六百聽、價為七十二元五角云、今日出口生油有一千四百二十聽、二百件又豆子二千九百九十包、均運香港、</p>
<h3>紗花　環境不利多方　紗市跌風重熾</h3>
<p>紗市跌風又起、局勢甚弱、此因實銷停滯、外匯放長不巳、人心又遭打擊、尤使多頭沮喪市情日趨下降、一般同業手貨甚鉅、且虧耗太大、暫時不願痛斬、兼之原棉下落和緩、故紗巿雖下　、然曲折殊繁、實緣底盤不及昔日之高，所以徘徊力龐大、根本問題還在實銷上掙扎也、</p>
<p>現紗開盤人氣散漫、因環境不利多方、且廣帮採辦無勁、開價即小十元、二十支雙馬價為六百三十元、旋聞匯票開出趨鬆、黃金下跌、會一度虛弱、再挫十元、低價至六百二十元、少頃外匯改縮、人心重振、雙馬收盤價為六百二十四元、査半日間成交統計一千零九十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌十四元、牧羊跌五元、特金城跌九元、天女跌十元、廠方由永安廠開出二十支特金城一百包、價為六百三十元、今日有棉紗一百九十件運天津、二百五十五件運香港、十五件運廣州灣、六十五件運北海、二十件運海口、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　五八五　香港　二三〇</p>
<p>寗波　五〇　廈門　二〇</p>
<p>內地　二〇　福州　三〇</p>
<p>江西　三〇　統計　一、〇九〇</p>
<h3>申新廠開始訂購美棉</h3>
<p>本棉交易依然沉悶如恒、廠方納胃奇滯、實緣紗價旣不振、而出路殊覺狹隘、因之對於原料暫無採辦之意、茲據某棉業機關消息、日商在前幾天購訂美棉額子甚鉅、而價格較印棉為廉、日廠更無亟乎吸收華棉、昨日永安廠成交通州花一千包、行情疲短二元以外、蘇北來源到通花二千四百零一包、常陰沙一千三百二十二包、北沙來一千九百三十包、今日有五十包運廣州灣、茲將現棉售開之盤錄左、</p>
<p>通州花一三二·〇〇永安一千包</p>
<p>通州花一二七·〇〇　金同業一</p>
<p>一二八·〇〇　五〇包</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來巳漸見活躍、中外廠方亦巳漸見動辦、同業交易亦頗為踴躍、所訂購者、俱為美棉、昨日申新亦已開始動辦、訂定美棉數千件、其他各廠亦有相當數額之訂定、惟印棉交易未聞有只包之做開也、</p>

<h3>華軍四十五旅　痛擊滬杭路日軍　高速度行軍日增援不及　兩晝夜日軍死傷數百名　南滙縣境戰事日指導官受傷</h3>
<p>滬杭滬寗蘇嘉三鐵路內之三角地區、地跨蘇浙兩界、因屬河沼縱橫之地、華軍流動部隊、由錢塘江飛渡北岸、源源開入補充、故現有人數、力足擊破任何一鐵道之日軍據點、自上次大隊圍殲滬杭路楓涇車站之日軍、並破壞兩座大橋後、楓涇以西三十餘華里之西塘鎭、曾被目為游擊隊根據地、而遭大刦、平民死於槍彈剌刀之下、巿房被燬甚夥、華軍方面、雖未受打擊、然均矢志竭力、為西塘民衆復仇、</p>
<p>華方進攻　用兵迅捷</p>
<p>本月，日二日問、散佈蘇浙邊境及澱山湖畔之華軍四十五旅田部、（聞上次襲擊楓涇破壞洋橋兩座者亦為田部）以高速度之行軍、穿過天馬山麓、向松江縣城進攻、一部繞過泗松公路、衝近明星橋、與日軍激戰於鐵路以北、松江縣城幾被包圍、交鋒之烈、得未曾有、田旅長身綁汽車胎數具、身先士卒、胸部着一槍彈、嵌於車胎中不出、故未受傷、激戰一日夜後、日軍節節敗退、</p>
<p>一度衝擊　明星橋站</p>

<p>激戰結果　均有傷亡</p>
<p>日軍捨舟登陸、展開激戰、日軍未備用鋼砲、係用步槍機槍手溜彈等為武器、故華軍武器上不稍示弱、雙方槍彈密如聯珠、激戰至中午、雙方均有傷亡、日軍未得絲毫進展、恐後路被斷、仍登汽艇退出閘港而去、閘港水道交通、五日起又吿恢復原狀、至范根才隊長、五日巳提早下鄕、此役據又一說、為日兵一名被游擊隊擊斃、日軍妄圖報復而起、</p>
<p>南滙日軍　攻二灶泓</p>

<h3>論宗派主義</h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>宗派和黨派是兩個絕對不同的範疇。前者祗不過是少數者徇私的表現，有着它封建的傳統性；後者則根據於大衆的立塲，有着所謂眞正的主義存在。</p>
<p>宗派是最要不得的，對於「個人主義者」有利，對於「羣體」却有害，會妨礙團結，更破壞統一戰綫；不論那個社會團體或種生產部門，一有宗派主義者底蹝跡，沒有不把整個機構弄糟的。火併，包辦，保守，壟斷，都是他們底傑作，然而眞正做些有益於大家的事情嗎，那倒又未必，除去於一己有利者之外。</p>
<p>在「黨派」的組織中，宗派主義者具體而微的表現是從事於秘密小組。……各自為謀，擠軋，誣攀，冒功，擴大「同人」的勢力，剷除別人的地位，種種無所不用其極。而對於一般人所揭的標語是：你來嗎，要根據「我們底」原則。由此而開香堂，收徒弟，主義祗是個人上什麽下什麽的諱號，靡有其他。</p>
<p>宗派主義者常常會借黨派的名義來聯絡和一己共通的感情；同時，更聰明得很，會引用些故事作辯護：「穿紅背心的戈底葉在戲院中和古典派大打出手，愛護同志的伊里奇在筆記裏給德波林們笑駡一通，這些並非排除異己，正有他們積極的意義。」他們底話正經地指出自己底堡壘竟是新的陣營，可是細察他們底內容却依然是舊傳統的一貫。</p>
<p>而宗派主義不斷的引長，則儼然採取了義和團式的行動，他們忽略了小圈子以外的存在，藐視一切所謂「閒人」「非正統派」！然而他們底內在的矛盾不曾消除，仍然拘拘於大師兄二師兄之間。這自然不足為奇，原是宗派主義者底ｇ　貫作風？</p>
<p>在「槍砲不入」的門牆以外，他們底感覺也彷彿極靈敏似的：駡人可以濫找名詞，人家是阿Q，他們自己倒無愧於未莊的趙太爺底身份；但稍有常識的正明白趙太爺更是歷史的障礙，嗾使地保壓迫阿Q一班人。自然，不容抹煞，雖然有着趙太爺的身份，可是不敢昧於時勢，也要反反封建。這樣就使自己成為反封建「專家」或世家」，專利所在，即使偶有一二句略涉同鄕會的宗派性的，亦必洶洶然給人家加上一頂可怕的帽子，這或許是「誤會」，然而此時此地的文人是吾應該採取這樣不分皂白的方式？這還是宗派主義者所派生出來的在作祟。</p>
<p>在蘇聯曾有這樣的事：某一個工廠裏工人們在國際認識上有了不同的意見，一部份强調了帝國主義間的矛盾，另外則以為這是取消派的意見，利用着權力就把道一部份開除黨籍，逐出產業部門；這一部份工人便不服，寫信給最高當局申訴，經當局指出不服者底正確。黨籍職業遂予以恢復。</p>
<p>上述的濫用權力，正有着宗派性的嫌疑，這是需要被大家克服過來的。</p>
<p>不論在政治上文藝上，蘇聯的「淸算宗派主義」的口號底提出該不是偶然的罷。</p>
<p>宗派主義者所走的路是「盲腸小路」，碰壁就會腐化，不經手術是不成的。</p>
<p>我們在此時此地要「擴大」淸算宗派主義！</p>
<h3>破廟夜宿</h3>
<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>——京滬綫戰地追記——</p>
<p>離丹陽城不滿三里，找到了一所簡陋的土地廟；它並不比隣村落，這可减少不少白天飛機的威脅。我們把行李搬了進去，迎面吹來了一陣晚風，感到有些冷意。</p>
<p>踏進土地廟，一股霉濕氣，衝進腦門；看來它巳被人擯棄了好久了。零落的窗格，破了面的大門，神像上堆積着厚厚的一層灰塵……</p>
<p>草草用過飯，倦意糾纏住了各人，同志們迅速地打開行李，在薄薄的稻草上躺下了。風從窗格中侵襲過來，使每個同志都　縮得像隻睡貓。</p>
<p>「報吿！」粗壯的拳頭碰在不完整的廟鬥上，發出一種討厭的破裂聲，打破了每個同志的好夢。</p>
<p>冬初寒冷的夜，本來難尋獲好夢，加上這意外的突擊，更覺有點給楞住了。</p>
<p>同志們把埋藏在被窩裹的頭露了出來，星光照進了破廟，是午夜，離曙光還遠哩！</p>
<p>×同志詢問着門外的傳令。說是：「命令四時向句容十里牌出發，三時半前準備好一切，現在巳是三點正了！」說完，一陣輕快的脚步聲，漸漸地遠去。</p>
<p>我們一聽是夜行，馬上感到興奮；忙的穿好衣服，收拾妥了行李。伙夫更辛苦，忙着埋鍋造飯。</p>
<p>飯前，師部送來了一批棉服，同志們對這一批禮物，看得比吃飯更開心，各人選着自巳適合的號碼，卸下了夾衣，換上新裝。</p>
<p>一陣暖意，使我油然地懷念起故鄕的慈母，對着前途的狼，更增一分痛恨。</p>
<p>是吃飯的時候了，想起僅有的一段殘燭，在造飯時燃盡了；於是祗有借力於微弱的星光。開大了門，讓光亮多透些進來；同志們對這新奇的吃法，感到特別的趣味。</p>
<p>微弱的星光，僅能捉摸住菜碗的輪廓，盛着什麽，祗有靠舌頭去味覺；同志們的笑聲，一直延長到空了所有的碗。</p>
<p>飯後，裝好行李，別了破廟，踏上丹句公路。夜色模糊着公路的四週，原野是沉寂地安息着。</p>
<p>環境更提高我們趕路的濃興，每個同志都有着一個：「在天明前趕去全程大半」的想頭。脚步放快了許多。</p>
<p>嗅着够刺激的新鮮冷氣，在平滑的路面上行進；擦擦聲衝破着四週的靜穆。</p>
<h3>羅絲學院</h3>
<p>— （M．Ch．16）</p>
<p>羅絲氏於一九三二年九月十六日死於「羅絲醫院」中，為酬謝該大科學家發明關於瘧疾之種種問題之故，全世界莫不歌頌之，蓋彼終生為瘧疾而奮鬥，遂使其名留於醫藥科學史中，永不磨滅也。</p>
<p>瘧疾在古代之歷史中，亦為一種最可怖之疾病，的於前世紀之末葉，人類對此種疾病及其所以傳染之道，巳具有一種普通概念矣，羅絲氏乃發現瘧疾之傳染係受一種特別蚊蟲所影響，此種毒蚊名曰「安奴非爾斯」，彼吮吸患有瘧疾者之血液，並吸取其血液中之寄生菌，而能將此種寄生物注射於康健者之身上。</p>
<p>此一發明，可視為醫藥界中任何新發明事物之最顯著者，蓋此事發明之後，千百萬人類之生命卽發生極大之轉變焉，事實上，自此厥後，瘧疾問題卽巳成為最令人竭力硏究之問題矣。</p>
<p>硏究之結果，巳獲不少極關重要之結果，但無論如何，研究工作仍繼續施行中，其專門處理此一問題之最重要機關，厥為倫敦之羅絲學院，該學院純賴自動捐款以資維持，但頗能盡其力量促進硏究瘧疾之工作，且巳獲得若干熱帶病學與處理瘧疾之著名權威者，如瓦特遜等之合作。</p>
<p>羅絲學院所處理各問題中之最重要者為授予患有瘧疾之苦之民衆以金鷄納霜，其後大加改進而設立金鷄納霜短期治療法焉。此種治法，國聯防瘧委員會認為其最妥善之治療方法，蓋治療期間巳遂漸减少至五日，或七日，在此期問內，僅須每日服食十五粒至十八粒之金鷄納霜而巳，愈後不必再有其他治療，惟倘舊病復發時，仍以同一方法治之，無不愈者，為預防起見，國聯防瘧委員會介紹於瘧疾盛行季節中每日常服金雞納霜六粒，卽可無此患焉。</p>
<p>羅絲院繼續以有成効方法實施其創辦人之工作，從未停頓也。</p>
<h3>塔</h3>
<p>— 史衛斯</p>
<p>落日遠在山後，把兩個影子拉得邁長，搖曳着在錯落的樹林空處。步子是寂寂的，迂緩得一如老人。是怎樣的一些夢的趣味，對着晚色，想起一些從來所未曾想起的事來。</p>
<p>踏過板橋，踏過靑靑的路上。</p>
<p>朋友是愛的直覺主義者，新近為戀愛的趣味所迷惘了的一個年靑人，竹林湖水裹，都埋着他的想像的影子。這周遭，該又逗留着他的苦戀之思了。對着他的出神的瞳子，我想有以調笑他，却苦於想不出一句適宜的話。</p>
<p>忽然我們停立在一處。破瓦殘牆，蕪草雜生，有一塔高聳，斜陽正跳躍在塔尖殘牆上，成一特殊景致。塔，不很高，却巳很可睥睨平地上一切平凡的小築。這處所是我們所熟習的。過去有一夏天，我會住在離這塔很近的一小樓裏，孤獨的生涯頗覺令我生厭。今天轉覺得六月晚風中望着塔下曠野，另有一好意義了。</p>
<p>朋友不知從何處想起，說，</p>
<p>『你可記得唐人詩：塔勢如湧出，孤高聳大宮？』</p>
<p>『正是這景色！』我說。可是我想起的是，可惜道已是殘塔了。</p>
<p>該是很小很小的時候了，我是自山鄕出來的，如今我眼前又浮起了那個倚嶺而築的小村。小時我是健步的，和如今完全不同，我愛爬山，爬上塔頂下瞰村落上四起的炊烟。那個小村勾引着我的記憶最多的，一直到現在，仍是那座小小的浮圖。據說在我祖公時代，有一天，洪水佔據了整個村田。三日三夜，忽然土山之上湧起了一座塔，在一陣響雷下，發水的妖孽鎭在塔下了，水也平了。</p>
<p>曾經有幾次，我想從幻想中為我那久別了的山鄕的鎭村之塔重繪一輪廓，那應有幾十個信民，圍着膜拜，作着香火祈禱罷？</p>
<p>『兩個塔，兩個不同的命運！』是的，你看都市的塔在寥落中蕭颯地剝落了，伴着荒山敗墟，讓風雨的痕劃着不斷的年代的影子！</p>
<p>至此，朋友忽然停止了他的高瞭感慨，驚奇的眼光落到我身上，你想像得出他那團　氣，一個靈魂被迷惑於環抱的山水，彷彿必需歌一段古詩風以表示出自己的渺小的人！</p>
<p>『你好像有了默思，你的意思是另外還有一個塔？』</p>
<p>『每個人心裏有一個塔，』可是我以為這是一宗悲哀，我述說了我的故事，「人類的趣味是建築在塔上的。假如你回到我那個山鄕，你看到那一羣善男信女，圍着塔頂禮膜拜。那個信仰的塔，其實是較土山上高聳湧出的塔更莊麗，更堅實的。他們在那兒尋得了生之趣，和想像的一切影子！於是這社會上有許多事因此而改變了。可是有一天，信仰的塔倒了，倒得怪慘的，你看，剝落荒殘，某種人的信心，就是這樣子！』</p>
<p>默默的瞳人子。我如聽到淸脆的一聲，是誰的心頭的琉璃七寳塔，又坍倒了。</p>
<p>踏着新月的影，西山不見了太陽，忽然悵然的，聽着遙遙浣婦的槌聲，兩個人同時均想到了歸去。</p>

<h3>山楓之歌</h3>
<p>— 蕙荷</p>
<p>征蹄踏碎了秋山底寗靜，</p>
<p>肅穆的山楓顫動着土色的心；</p>
<p>從凄風中辭別故枝，</p>
<p>片片被鐵蹄踐成灰燼。</p>
<p>枝上的楓葉並未顯着沮喪，</p>
<p>酡人底顏比往昔更輝煌：</p>
<p>是塗染了英雄的膏血，</p>
<p>從火藥的氛圍中長成這般雄壯。</p>
<p>聽慣了號角的聲喧，</p>
<p>刀光槍影在陽光裏紛亂；</p>
<p>知道這般地死並非生命的浪費，</p>
<p>古來英雄誰不曾把頭顱拚！</p>
<p>沙沙的音饗驚住了秋風的豪興，</p>
<p>馬蹄聲從雜亂而至寗靜；</p>
<p>隱約有牧女底笛曲，</p>
<p>酡顏上現出嚴肅的勝利之笑意。</p>

<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒　首次演戀愛片</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>不久以前，有一篇影評內有這樣的幾句話：「為了遷就一個演員的演技而特地為他編製劇本，在好萊塢已成了一時風尙」，這種辦法，亦可說為的是迎合觀衆的心理。但若長此以往，我想結果是仍要被他們厭棄的。像秀蘭鄧波兒以前所主演各片的內容終以歌舞為主，雖轟動過整個的銀壇，最近由於她年齡的漸長，這種幼稚的動作，終於給觀衆們所鄙視了。好萊塢的一般製片家也見到這點，在她的新作“Susannah　of　the　Nounties”中，導演的除了歌舞外，又為她加了一些戀愛塲面，秀蘭鄧波兒演戀愛片，這回可算是第一遭了！當她表演到談情說愛的時候，她的小心內不知要有什麽感想！</p>
<p>再値得一提的，在該片內，有一個秀蘭鄧波兒抽板燜的鏡頭。讀者中有的一定要感到希罕像她這樣年紀怎麽會抽烟。原來她用的烟斗是由佈置「芝加哥大火記」最後一幕大火佈景的工程師所特置，外觀是在吸烟，但烟是一口都不進嘴的。</p>
<h3>好萊塢兩種新舞蹈</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>好萊塢和紐約兩地，最近流行兩種新型的交際舞，男女極為熱在。南加里福尼亞州著名的「社交舞師範學校，』以此兩舞式為必修課。美國最近一次的「全國舞藝聯合會」在紐約舉行時，會長安乃楊氏也發表：美國的交際舞已進入一個新階段，陳腐盡去，一切都有別開生面之勢。</p>
<p>所謂兩種新舞蹈，一名「巴克慢步」（Polk　Orando）以足跟與足尖支持，全身迴旋為主。動作甚緩，旋律勻整，音樂較其他舞式更為甜美，而旋轉中又夾有許多花巧，實係綜合各種舞式之長而演進的；另一種名「蓬蓬舞」（Boomps-A-Daisy），帶着輕鬆滑稽形式，即以代替熱鬧一時的「倫勃斯」舞步，但雙方的表情巳更進一步。舞時男女舞伴，先互拍對方手掌，再拍自己膝部，然後身子迴旋不巳。在迴旋之中，男子「無意間」衝撞對方身體，女即回過臉來，作白眼並驚訝之狀，音樂驟停，形勢微呈緊張。最後男方低頭道歉，女伴回嗔作喜，樂聲復起，兩舞伴重復合作，任意作自由之舞式。</p>

<h3>推荐新時末遺恨</h3>
<p>— 梯公</p>
<p>此時此地，居然看到這樣的東西，怎不呌人又驚又喜？</p>
<p>睡在枕上，再也入不了夢，身子上一陣陣的發熱，當嫩娘噴出口內的血的時候，我週身的血，也巳如一鑊沸水，直到此刻，還不曾寗靜。</p>
<p>我愛嫩娘，我愛美娘，我更愛馬金子，這一個「上馬獻金的馬金，兒子的子」，的天眞姑娘！</p>
<p>周信芳口中有「商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花」。嫩娘口中也有這兩句，甚至蔡如蘅口中也喊出這兩句，然而所給予觀衆的是三種不同的感應。</p>
<p>到此時為止在皮黃中似乎還不曾見到比明末遺恨更有意義的作品。然而魏如晦先生的新作，無疑地至少要比前者强有力十倍。</p>
<p>這原因是崇禎與我們老百姓間的距離，比較疏遠一點。可是我們可以做孫克咸，可以做葛嫩娘，最低也可以做一個馬金子。</p>
<p>我謹以至高無上的敬意，致給上海劇藝社全體先生女士們。我敬以奮激的熱誠，向全上海仕女推荐這部萬萬不可不看的傑構。我更熱烈希望幾位皮黃批評家，破例去看一次話劇「明末遺恨」，在音韻，腔調，身段，字眼之外，另外發掘一點新的萌芽，好好地帶回去播散在皮黃的園地裏。</p>
<h3>倫敦的防空戲院</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>歐戰爆發後，英國雖然厲行防空，從事都會人口的疏散，但大半並無十分變動。公共娛樂事業中，只有跑馬香賓賽，禁止舉行，其他足球賽，馬戲，電影等，都照常營業。倫敦一般糜登化的戲院都已有了防空設備。其中著名的金藍馬戲塲，佈置允其週到，男女招待員都帶了防毒面具，內部又有醫院一所，可以隨時替看客急救。一般影戲院的門前，也皇皇揭示着：「設備摩登，保險安全，諸君不信，前來一試」</p>
<p>各戲院所映的影片，以輕鬆避免刺激為主。但對於空軍的壯烈情形，也加以宣揚。英國今年第一部戰爭片，名為「挿翅神獅」（The　Lion　has　Wings，由男明星李哈特遜担任飛將軍，女明星曼爾奧勃朗担任多情的看護婦，發揮英國空軍的壯偉精神。</p>
<p>倫敦市上又開映德國國社黨宣傳部製造的「德波大戰序幕」一片，本來是德國軍隊自我吹噓的影片，却不道宣傳技術惡劣之故，反而處處給英勇的波蘭人作着宜傳。</p>
<p>銀幕上旣有種種笑料，地底下又有安全設備，不怕敵機前來侵襲，所以防空戲院生意十分熱鬧。警祭署現規定倫敦各戲院開映時間，可自上午十時延長到晚間十時，一般影迷，越發覺得方便了。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>老生老旦之戞調</p>
<p>此番更新舞臺大加整頓後，有一事頗為顧曲界所稱道者即苜批新角中特的一老旦李多奎，不惟可以一新海上顧曲家之耳目，抑且李之呌座能力確佔全體三分之一以上。此實出於邀角人意料之外者。考其動機本因五六年前杜君菊初北上邀角當時不佞在平，日與多奎相晤，遂薦李於杜，並以一千三百元之包銀一言而定。南來後成績頗佳，此次杜與梅花館主復負更新邀角使命，不悉吳素秋等號召力若何，為駕輕就熟計，遂將此唯一龔派傳人邀之俱來，包銀僅略增數百元，不料開幕後李之風頭獨健，有時一段內竟句句得好，打破已往之記錄。一則因多奎之嗓音響堂，吃調又高，雖二層樓上亦可聽之眞切：二則因李絕不偷瀨，所有劇中應使戞調之處，無不提足氣力，由丹田中發出一種充沛雄實之音，大喝一聲，四座皆驚，所謂「晴天霹靂」，眞足以振聾發瞶，而使人精神為之一振也。</p>
<p>按「戞調」只限於使用本嗓之老生、武老生、紅生、老旦、諸角用之，若用假嗓或變嗓之旦角、小生、凈角，即無法使用戞調矣。且戞調復有輭硬及半戞調之別，同時使於二黃與西皮者又有難易之分。（一三五）</p>

<h3>After the Passing of Centenarian, Catholic Circle Deeply Mourns, Yu Bin Goes to Lang Son to Handle Funeral Arrangements and Will Hold a Solemn Mass</h3>
<p>Chongqing, after the passing of State Councilor, Centenarian, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, people from all walks of life here are overcome with grief. Bishop Yu Bin will take a plane to Hanoi on the morning of the 7th and then take a car to Lang Son to handle the funeral arrangements on behalf of the Catholic Church and will hold a solemn mass in Lang Son. According to Bishop Yu's interview with reporters this morning, Mr. Ma's words and deeds during his lifetime were indeed a model for the generation. His great personality will be forever admired by future generations, and his academic career will also be immortal. This is known to all Chinese people, so there is no need to say more. In particular, Mr. Ma devoted himself to the Catholic Church. He was a devout Catholic during his lifetime and wanted to infuse the spirit of Jesus into our entire society so that it could be combined with our country's inherent morality, change the atmosphere, and revive our country's inherent national virtues. He devoted his life to the Catholic Church and educational and cultural undertakings. When I took office as Bishop of the Nanjing District, I immediately welcomed Mr. to Beijing and benefited greatly from his planning and assistance in religious affairs. In recent years, he has been engaged in translating the Bible, word by word, and the book has been translated. This is Mr.'s last work and is very valuable. However, the original manuscript is still in the occupied area, and it has now been decided to find a way to retrieve it and publish it so that it can be published and distributed as soon as possible. Mr. stated that he had two great aspirations in his life: first, to hope that the Catholic Church would be expanded and that the number of bishops of Chinese nationality would increase day by day; second, to hope that our country's war of resistance could win the final victory. Today, our country already has more than 20 bishops of Chinese nationality. Mr.'s first wish can be said to have been achieved. It is a pity that heaven cannot give Mr. more time to witness our country's war of resistance for justice, humanity, independence, and survival win the final victory, and he died with his ambition. I dare to believe that our 3.5 million Catholics will be able to fulfill Mr.'s will and comfort his spirit in heaven. Now that Mr. has suddenly passed away, the National Government will surely have a clear decree to praise him, and Mr.'s students are all over the world, and after mourning, they will never forget Mr.'s virtue. As for our Catholic Church, we will also hold a grand mass to mourn Mr. After I finish handling the funeral arrangements in Lang Son, I will come to Chongqing to hold a mass for Mr. Bishop Yu spoke with great sorrow during the interview. According to Mr. Ma's position in the Catholic Church, he was a priest, actually a high-ranking clergyman in Bishop Yu's jurisdiction. However, Bishop Yu respected him very much and often went to meet and consult him in Beijing. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing, Yu Youren and Shao Lizi convened a Fudan Alumni Association on the evening of the 6th to discuss ways to console Mr. Ma Xiangbo. It was decided to ask Bishop Yu to send condolences on behalf of the association, and a special telegram was sent to console Mr. Ma's family. In addition to sending telegrams to console the family, Yu and Shao also sent elegies. It is heard that Mr. Xiang's coffin will be temporarily placed in Lang Son. Chairman Lin also sent a telegram to Lang Son to console his family upon hearing the news. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chongqing's Population Increases Again</h3>
<p>Chongqing, the population of Chongqing, which had been dispersed after the large-scale bombing by Japanese planes in May, has gradually increased again. It increased to 350,000 in September and to 470,000 in October. However, compared with the time before the large-scale bombing in May, it is still not as good by far, because at that time Chongqing had a population of 800,000. The official here originally planned to reduce the city's population to 120,000, but the suburbs do not have sufficient housing, so the people still have to return to city life. It is heard that those who return to live here from the countryside must obtain a permit from the garrison headquarters. (6th US Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Stockpiled German Goods at Haiphong Awaiting Shipment to China</h3>
<p>Chongqing, the value of German goods purchased by the Chinese side and stockpiled at Haiphong awaiting shipment to the Chinese mainland is as high as 90 million yuan. It is heard that these goods have recently been transported to the border of Annam. After this batch of German goods is transported into China, there will be no more German goods transported into Haiphong. One reason is that the French in Annam will no longer allow German goods to be imported, and the second is due to the internal restrictions of Germany itself. Therefore, during the continuation of the European war, German goods cannot be imported into China. According to a French official in charge speaking to the Associated Press reporter, rumors that the Annam border has very strict transportation restrictions do not correspond with the facts. Special restrictions were only implemented for one week after the outbreak of the European war. Since then, everything except German goods has been allowed to pass. Even in the case of German goods, those that have already been paid for by the Chinese government or merchants are regarded as the property of the Chinese and are allowed to pass. Only goods for which the payment has not yet been made are regarded as German goods and confiscated by the French authorities in Annam. This action is not surprising because France is currently at war with Germany. (6th US Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Brief Reports from Northern Jiangsu</h3>

Now they have started the so-called "third phase of sweeping", with Kitagawa, who has rich combat experience, as the commander, and they dispatch troops in four routes every day, with a turbulent situation. On the 16th, more than 100 Japanese soldiers, three cars, and two cannons invaded the sixth district of Xudong Tongshan. They encountered the Chinese army and a fierce battle broke out. After holding out for four hours, the Chinese army dispatched another unit to attack the Japanese army's flank, causing the Japanese formation to be thrown into disarray and flee. In this battle, six Japanese soldiers were killed and four were wounded. Also on the 15th, the Japanese army drove several military trains from Xuzhou to the east, carrying more than 2,000 Japanese and puppet troops, as well as four heavy cannons and two armored vehicles, and arrived at the Grand Canal station.

<p>The Japanese army on the western front has repeatedly attempted to invade from Jieshou, but has failed each time. On the evening of the 23rd, a Japanese iron-hulled ship sailed from Jieshou Lake to the Jieshou River. At 11:00 AM on the 24th, more than 100 Japanese soldiers from the ship, carrying two cannons and several machine guns, went to the Jieshou River embankment and forcibly landed, firing 20 shots into Jieshou Street. Then they advanced forward. The Chinese guards then fired at them from their strongholds. At the same time, another unit attacked the Japanese army's flank. Seeing that the Chinese army was prepared, the Japanese army retreated to the original ship. At 6:00 PM that night, the Japanese army again used four or five speedboats to attack the Chinese army's position, and a fierce battle broke out. The Chinese army used machine guns to strafe, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army still did not dare to land. After holding out for three hours, they fled back to the speedboats and escaped back into the lake. On the morning of the 25th, there was no trace of the Japanese army on the Jieshou River embankment. The Chinese side is actively destroying the highway leading into the area, but a small Japanese warship and seven or eight speedboats are still moored on the lake, and four Japanese seaplanes are parked on the water.</p>

<p>The new American Neutrality Act, passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, has already been signed by President Roosevelt, immediately taking effect and becoming American law. This demonstrates President Roosevelt's ongoing struggle against isolationists within his country, achieving the goal of amending the neutrality law. Regardless of whether this success is due to the American public's sympathy for democratic nations, thus abolishing the arms embargo clause and granting Britain and France the convenience of purchasing from America, or whether it is due to the American public's concerns that the sinking of the Athenia, with American passengers aboard, and the capture of the City of Flint, an American merchant ship, could drag America into the war, the new neutrality law empowers the American President to prohibit American ships and citizens from entering war zones. The passage of this new neutrality law proves that Roosevelt's policies have gained widespread support from the American people, and that the President's power is sufficient to control both houses of Congress. At a time when the prestige of the American executive leader is increasing daily, China naturally hopes that America will take action in the Pacific, as General Bai Chongxi said, "not only paying lip service to the Nine-Power Treaty's Open Door Policy, but also further suspending the sale of military raw materials to Japan." This is because such a move would be most beneficial to China, but this cannot be sought in the new Neutrality Act. Although the passage of the new Neutrality Act facilitates the purchase of munitions by democratic nations, its scope of application is limited to Europe and does not apply to the Far East. However, a large-scale war has been going on in the Far East for two years and three months. Although this war is undeclared, it has its importance and its particularity. China's war of resistance is a war against aggression; at the same time, China is a country with a backward heavy industry. In terms of the supply of military needs and the addition of weapons, it needs the assistance of countries that sympathize with China's war of resistance. As far as the United States is concerned, although it is inconvenient to show favoritism towards any particular country, in terms of morality, the United States has an obligation to uphold fairness, resist injustice, and protect the invaded against the invader. The abolition of the arms embargo clause allows democratic countries such as Britain and France, which possess naval superiority and a large number of merchant ships, to use cash to purchase large quantities of important weapons of war from the United States. In principle, the United States is impartial to all belligerent countries in Europe; however, in spirit, it is invisibly assisting democratic countries of the same political system and giving a major blow to fascist aggressor countries. Therefore, the abolition of the arms embargo clause and the implementation of the so-called cash-and-carry policy, we can confidently say, is absolutely beneficial to the democratic countries of Western Europe. But in the Far East, the situation is exactly the opposite. China needs to import munitions from overseas, as mentioned above. However, China's navy and merchant ships are virtually non-existent. As a result, Japan can purchase weapons from the United States and transport them itself, facilitating its invasion of China, while China has no way to purchase and transport munitions. Although the new neutrality law allows us to understand that the original intention of amending the neutrality law was not to facilitate the aggressor countries in the Far East and strike a blow to China's war of resistance, it is not enough for the United States to have this passive "no malice" towards the Far East and towards China. There must be more active actions to display the spirit of American justice.</p>
<p>Perhaps the policy adopted by the current President Roosevelt is the same as that of the late President Theodore Roosevelt: the action is slow, but the "big stick" is held in hand. The expansion of the great navy, the fortification of Hawaii, the Aleutian Islands, and the establishment of air force bases on the Pacific islands of Panama, all kinds of military offensive establishments, are accompanied by diplomatic offensives; such as repeatedly reiterating the Open Door Policy in the past, and more recently, the talks by its diplomatic envoys to safeguard interests in China, and the current memorandum from the US Ambassador to Japan to Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura, expressing extreme resentment at Japan's economic exclusionism and damage to American interests. It is widely rumored that the United States will implement economic sanctions against Japan. Although this rumor has been denied by the authorities, the United States, in order to safeguard its traditional interests in China and restore world peace, merely expresses and acts diplomatically. It is probably insufficient to contain the madness of aggression; only the implementation of economic sanctions is a truly effective method. We deeply know that the United States has various internal reasons that make its actions have to be slow; and we also deeply know that the United States must follow sequential measures until it implements its Far East policy of containing aggression; therefore, although we hope that the United States will adopt effective methods, we are not eager and impatient. When the water flows, the channel will be formed, and there will be a day for it, and we also deeply know that the day is not far away. As for the present, however, it is believed that after the United States amends the Neutrality Act, and when the Far East has not been recognized as a state of war, it should make full use of the leeway left by the new Neutrality Act, and supply China with munitions loaded on American merchant ships. A large amount of munitions has a great use, and a small amount of munitions also has a small use; however, its significance is not in the amount, but in symbolizing the determination of the United States to implement its Far East policy.</p>
<h3>American Foreign Affairs Association Advocates Economic Pressure on Japan; Commercial Treaty Abolition Allows Free Action; This Can Promote Resolution of the Far East Problem</h3>
<p>Washington - The American Foreign Affairs Association issued a special article today, stating that since the outbreak of the European War, the United States can exert pressure on Japan to force it to submit, because the United States is now in a pivotal position. As for the negotiations currently being conducted by Ambassador Grew in Tokyo, the focus of the issue is whether the United States has the determination to insist on resolving major issues (including Japan's expansion into the Asian continent). Currently, there are only two ways to resolve the Far East problem: (1) restore China's territorial integrity and the "Open Door Policy;" (2) the interests of Western countries are bound by Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia." If the first method is followed, there is hope for a solution to the Sino-Japanese hostility, and it can achieve considerable stability. If the second method is followed, this hostility will be prolonged indefinitely. In order to continue the war of resistance, China will completely lean towards the Soviet Union. As for the interests of Western countries in the Japanese-occupied areas, they will be at the mercy of Japan. The article also talked about the possibility of American economic retaliation against Japan. Since the United States abolished the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, it has made the United States unconstrained and can use severe economic retaliation to protect American interests.

<h3>Japan Sends Kato to Shanghai to Return American Merchant's Tung Oil</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Japanese special envoy Kato will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and will negotiate with American Consul General Gauss and other third-country officials. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to a question from reporters today about whether the Japanese government was forcing missionaries in the occupied areas of North China to evacuate, saying that the Japanese government had no such intention. Some missionaries in certain areas evacuated because of the abnormal situation caused by the Sino-Japanese War. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Japanese Embassy here announced yesterday that the tung oil purchased by American merchants detained in Hankou was returned by the Japanese authorities in the middle of last week and is now being transported to Shanghai by Japanese ships. It will be transferred from Shanghai to the United States. This action by the Japanese authorities is a response to the American government's protest. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to Japan Arrives in Tokyo Yesterday to Take Office</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin arrived in Tokyo today with his family and counselors. He avoided seeing reporters and went to the Soviet Embassy in Azabu District. (Domei, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs solemnly denied today that Ambassador Grew had threatened Foreign Minister Nomura with the United States imposing economic pressure during their meeting last Saturday. The Washington dispatches carried in this morning's newspapers included a formal statement issued by the US State Department, which strongly denied the Tokyo report that the US Ambassador had threatened economic pressure. The US State Department's statement stated that Tokyo reported that US Ambassador Grew had told Foreign Minister Nomura that if Japan continued its current plans in China, it would be at risk of being subjected to American economic pressure. This court had received a telegram from Ambassador Grew stating that it had made this kind of economic sanction threat. The spokesman continued, saying that there was nothing to add to the statement issued last Saturday. Foreign Minister Nomura's request for a meeting with the American Ambassador was merely to personally listen to the American Ambassador's views on the US-Japan situation. The atmosphere during the talks was extremely harmonious. Neither Foreign Minister Nomura nor Ambassador Grew made any threats. The American Ambassador repeatedly stated his personal desire to see the situation between the two countries achieve a peaceful resolution, and Foreign Minister Nomura also expressed the same. At this point, a reporter from a certain newspaper mentioned that former Foreign Minister Arita had stated to the press on Saturday that the resolution of general issues between the United States and Japan was not yet the time, but individual issues could be resolved one by one. The spokesman replied that the Japanese government did not want to conduct formal negotiations with the United States in the form of a Tokyo or Washington conference at this time. "We" hope that the "New Central Government" of China can be organized soon, and the situation in East Asia will be clarified as a result. When asked whether this "New Central Government" was a prerequisite for Japan to begin formal negotiations with third countries, the spokesman replied, "We." However, he acknowledged that the recognition of the "New Central Government" would clarify the situation in several aspects. In short, the ill will of third countries towards Japan mostly arose from the large-scale war being waged in China. Therefore, when the abnormal situation is clarified and the large-scale war ends, everything will be completely changed. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Statement: Preparing to Negotiate with the Soviet Union; Says US Ambassador Did Not Mention Economic Sanctions When Meeting with Foreign Minister Nomura</h3>
<p>Tokyo - A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the Japanese government is preparing to negotiate with the Soviet Union to resolve outstanding issues such as negotiation of the commercial treaty. Japan and Manchuria have now appointed representatives to meet with Soviet representatives. As for the representatives' names and the date of the start of the meeting, it is not appropriate to formally announce them at this time. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Stalemate in Indian Question; Negotiations Break Down Between Governor-General and Gandhi, Etc.</h3>
<p>London - Governor-General Linlithgow recently held negotiations in New Delhi with representatives of the All-India Congress and the All-India Muslim League in order to resolve the Indian question. These negotiations have now broken down. The India Office has just published the Governor-General's statements and correspondence with the leaders of both sides. The Governor-General's statement stated that he had frankly discussed everything with All-India Congress leaders Gandhi and Prasad, and All-India Muslim League President Jinnah, asking them to discuss the status of each province themselves in order to propose recommendations for expanding the Governor-General's Executive Council. After the discussions between the two sides, representatives of the major parties still had differing opinions on the basic issues. However, he had intended to find ways to mediate and would consult with party leaders and local princes at an appropriate time to make further efforts to see if there was any possibility of seeking unity among all parties. All-India Congress leader Prasad wrote to the Governor-General on November 3, stating that the All-India Congress could not accept the British policy implied in the Governor-General's declaration, nor could it consider subsequent steps of cooperation, unless the British government clearly declared its policy in the declaration, based on the methods proposed by the All-India Congress. Muslim League leader Jinnah also wrote to the Governor-General, stating that he had met with All-India Congress leaders to discuss with them. They then declared that if the British government did not approve the demands contained in the resolutions of the All-India Congress Committee, they could not discuss the Governor-General's statement on the central and provincial regimes. Thus, these two issues could not be discussed further. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Glimmer of Hope in Soviet-Finnish Negotiations; Finnish Government Drafting New Instructions; Content of Soviet Union's Latest Demands Reduced Compared to Before</h3>
<p>Finnish Capital - Regarding the current negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the negotiations are proceeding normally, but progress is quite slow. The government is currently drafting new instructions, which must be submitted to the Cabinet for approval after receiving a telegram report from the delegation from Moscow, and then issued. The date will be after the 7th of this month. In addition, political figures are holding a calm attitude towards the situation between Finland and the Soviet Union and are quietly waiting for the outcome of the negotiations. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Danish Capital - Regarding the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland, the Moscow correspondent of the local political newspaper recently telegraphed that the Finnish delegation has telegraphed the latest demands made by the Soviet Union to its own government, and that the content has been reduced compared to what was proposed before. According to foreign observers, Soviet newspapers have stopped attacking Finland, which is a good sign. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital - Regarding the ongoing negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, local newspapers said that although the representatives of both sides did not continue negotiations today, judging from the phenomena, there is a possibility of reaching a compromise. A glimmer of hope has already been revealed, and the pessimistic psychology of the Scandinavian Peninsula countries can gradually be eliminated as a result. According to this compromise, the Soviet Union will reportedly set up a naval base on the small island of Suursaari south of Hogland, as the "Gibraltar of the Baltic Sea," but will not set up a base on the mainland of Finland or on the island of Hanko. At the same time, the islands of Suursaari will still belong to Finland. However, there is also a difficulty, that is, the small island of Suursaari is close to the coast of Sweden, and if it is ceded to the Soviet Union, the Swedish government will not be happy to hear about it. In addition, the terrain of the small island is dangerous, enough to control the throat of the islands of Suursaari and the island of Hanko, and this layer is also very important. In addition, the Rybachy Peninsula in northern Finland will reportedly be ceded to the Soviet Union, along with the port of Petsamo (on the coast of the Arctic Ocean), and the Soviet Union will exchange it for the Karelian Isthmus. It is generally believed that if the port of Petsamo belongs to the Soviet Union, the naval bases of the country on the White Sea, allowing it to be the port of Murmansk, can be absolutely stable. On the Finnish side, the last thoroughfare for overseas traffic will be cut off as a result, because the country's shipping line in the Baltic Sea was originally controlled by the German Navy, and at this time, it is only safe to take the route through the port of Petsamo. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital - According to the Moscow news reported by "Aftonbladet," the Soviet Union and Finland are expected to reach an understanding, but Finnish capital news is that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations will take at least one week. However, all reports said that the Soviet Union has rejected the Finnish proposal, which rejected the Soviet Union's demand to occupy the island of Hanko. It is said that the Finnish government is busy drafting new instructions to be handed over to the Finnish delegation in Moscow. If Prime Minister Cajander, Foreign Minister Erkko, and the three army representatives can agree on the new proposals to the Soviet Union today, a full cabinet meeting will be convened immediately. The Finnish instructions will be telegraphed to the Finnish delegation at night so that they can respond to the Soviet government before the October Revolution holiday. It is said that this instruction focuses on the issue of the island of Hanko. People in Helsinki believe that the Finnish government will give in and prepare to compromise with the Soviet Union. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>Finnish Capital - Foreign Minister Molotov will host a banquet for the diplomatic corps on the anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. The Finnish representatives have also received Mr. Molotov's invitation and are scheduled to attend the Red Army parade tomorrow. Regarding the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, according to people in the Finnish government, the progress is extremely slow, but Soviet newspapers have now stopped publishing anti-Finnish remarks. People here are very satisfied with this. (Haitong, 6th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The Finnish Cabinet convened yesterday to discuss the content of the new instructions to be sent to the Finnish delegation in Moscow. Officials here are extremely tight-lipped. According to official sources here, although Soviet-Finnish relations are tense, there is still a possibility of continued negotiations. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Finnish Capital - According to well-informed sources here, the content of the new Finnish government instructions is again a concession to Soviet demands. The Finnish government has expressed concessions in the Karelia area and is willing to survey new boundaries, but is unwilling to make any concessions on the Hanko issue. (Haitong, 6th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Plans to Request the Repatriation of Russians in Lithuania</h3>
<p>Moscow - It is heard that the Soviet government plans to propose a suggestion to Lithuania, with reference to the German method of withdrawing Germans from various places, to repatriate the 170,000 Russians in the country, of which the largest number are in the Svencionys area. However, Lithuania is not rich, and if it accepts this suggestion, it will inevitably make great sacrifices, because the Russians who recently left Vilnius have taken all their belongings with them. By analogy, all Russians will take all their belongings with them when they leave the country in the future, which is not what Lithuania wants to hear. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Britain and the Soviet Union Conduct Economic Negotiations, Listing a List of Goods</h3>
<p>London - Regarding the economic negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, well-informed sources here recently stated that Britain has listed a list of various major products that can be ordered from the Soviet Union. It is expected that the Soviet government will submit an answer this week and will also list the types of goods that the country can order from Britain. Regarding this, what the British commercial authorities are eager to prevent is that the Soviet Union will resell various raw materials to Germany after purchasing them from Britain. For this reason, the goods that can be promised to be sold to the Soviet Union must be those that the Soviet Union itself urgently needs and cannot be resold to Germany, or those that Germany already has and does not need to be supplied by the Soviet Union, so as to avoid aiding the enemy. As for the economic assistance that the Soviet Union can give to Germany, its scope must be very limited, because the items that Germany urgently needs, such as oil, are also needed by the Soviet Union itself and are difficult to export in large quantities. The only thing that best meets the supply and demand between the Soviet Union and Germany is manganese produced by the Soviet Union. However, this metal product is quite bulky, and under the current circumstances, transportation is not easy. In addition, the issue of payment is also a difficult problem for Germany. The country plans to pay for the goods with various machines, and even send technicians and mechanics to the Soviet Union to help it start or develop certain industries as a reward. In Britain, the purchase of goods from the Soviet Union can be paid in cash. It is clear that the Soviet Union will not be attracted by this benefit, as can be seen from the situation of the economic negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>German Ship "Bremen" Docked in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Bergen, Norway - According to news obtained by a United Press reporter from sailors on the American ship "City of Flint," the magnificent German cruise ship "Bremen" is currently docked in the Soviet port of Murmansk, but its hull is painted gray. When the European War broke out, the German cruise ship "Bremen" happened to be in New York. After leaving New York, the British Navy searched for it in many ways, but unexpectedly it escaped to the Soviet Arctic port. It is heard that there are many ships docked in the port. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Finland Plans to Purchase Munitions from the United States</h3>
<p>Helsinki - Although no comments have been published here on the passage of the new Neutrality Act by the United States, all parties welcome it very much. It is heard that the Finnish government and private individuals have one million US dollars in cash in the United States, which can be used to purchase munitions needed by Finland in the future. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>Several German Aircraft Fly Over Belgium; Belgian Government Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>Belgian Capital - The authorities recently announced that several German aircraft flew into the country's airspace yesterday. The government authorities have instructed the ambassador to Germany to lodge a strong protest with the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris - Three German reconnaissance planes flew over the city of Tourcoing in northern France yesterday. The local air defense forces immediately issued an alert, and the anti-aircraft artillery fired. The German planes then returned to the country via the Belgian border. It is not unusual for German aircraft to violate Belgian neutrality. Compared with the fact that British and French aircraft avoid flying into the airspace of neutral countries, it is not the same. In addition, reconnaissance planes from both sides were slightly active yesterday. At night, the German army attacked the French advanced troops and were repelled. Apart from this, everything else was calm and uneventful. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>The Flint City Case: Norway Rejects German Protest, States Release Was According to International Law</h3>
<p>Oslo: Regarding the case of the American cargo ship "Flint City," after Germany protested to Norway yesterday, the Norwegian government has already responded to the German Chargé d'Affaires, rejecting the protest. The contents of the response have not yet been published, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement explaining that the Norwegian government's measures were taken entirely in accordance with international law. It stated: "The American cargo ship 'Flint City' arrived at Tromsø Island in our country on the 20th of last month. At that time, we only allowed it to dock for 24 hours, and the ship sailed to Murmansk, Soviet Union, on the decided day. Regarding this matter, our government exchanged official letters with the German Chargé d'Affaires. The German side believes that captured ships can sail in neutral waters, as long as they do not dock in neutral ports, and there is no time limit. Our country also expressed agreement with this view. On the 30th of last month, the ship returned to Tromsø Island without stopping. In order to avoid accidents, we sent a warship to escort it within our territorial waters. When the ship sailed south of Bergen Harbor, it stopped. The shipowner (a German military officer) reported that a crew member was ill and requested to dock at Hog Bay for medical treatment. Our warship immediately sent a medical officer on board. It was claimed that the crew member only had a minor injury to his leg. Our warship ordered the 'Flint City' not to anchor in Hog Bay, but the ship did not comply. When questioned, the German shipowner claimed, 'It is under the orders of the German government' to consult with the German consul. Article 13 of the 1907 Hague Convention stipulates that if a ship captured by a belligerent nation anchors in a neutral port not due to weather conditions or lack of food and fuel, the neutral nation may restore its freedom. This convention was approved by both our country and Germany, and when the 'Flint City' initially decided to anchor in Tromsø Island, the German Chargé d'Affaires's view was based on this convention. Therefore, our government released the 'Flint City' and detained the German sailors on board. All of these actions are entirely in accordance with international law. Afterwards, the German Chargé d'Affaires lodged a protest with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 4th of this month, requesting that we intercept the ship, and that other issues be resolved through negotiations between the two governments. We believe that there is no legal reason to comply, and have responded to the Chargé d'Affaires explaining our views." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Bern: The Basler Nachrichten recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that after the Norwegian government detained the German sailors from the American cargo ship "Flint City," the German Foreign Office ordered its ambassador to Norway to demand their release from the Norwegian government. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Oslo: After the American cargo ship "Flint City" arrived in Bergen Harbor yesterday, the American Minister to Norway, Mrs. Harriman, went to the port this evening to comfort the crew members. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Bergen, Norway: According to a wireless report today from Captain Gannatt of the American ship "Flint City," the German sailors escorting the ship threatened the American sailors that if the American sailors took any resistance actions, they would sink the ship. It was also said that the German escorting sailors carried sixty hand grenades, ten pistols, twenty bayonets, and one machine gun. Fortunately, the American sailors did not cause any trouble along the way and were safe. His driving direction was completely under the powerful command of the Germans. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Dutch Foreign Ministry Publishes Yellow Paper: Neutrality Repeatedly Violated, Shipping Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>The Hague: The Dutch Foreign Ministry yesterday published a Yellow Paper, first printing the full text of the Anglo-German declarations respecting Dutch neutrality, and then detailing the repeated violations of Dutch neutrality after the outbreak of the European War, as well as the great impact of British control measures on Dutch shipping. The book discloses a letter from Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens to British Foreign Secretary Halifax, in which he expresses that the Netherlands reserves the right to protest any "contraband list" that violates international law and harms the commerce of neutral countries. At the same time, he protests the British control authorities' detention of Dutch ships in controlled ports and the prohibition of contact with common companies. The British government replied that the detention period for Dutch ships could be reduced, but goods suspected of being contraband must be kept in custody until the British authorities allow them to be delivered to the buyers.

<h3>Former Polish President Mościcki Relocates</h3>
<p>Bucharest: Former Polish President Mościcki arrived in Craiova this morning from Băile Herculane. It is reported that Mościcki relocated to Craiova because the climate there was unsuitable. In other news, former Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is currently staying alone in Calonțești due to heart problems. Other Polish cabinet members are all in Manhattan.

<h3>Mayor Max of Brussels Dies: Earned Renown in the Last Great War, A Model for Mayors Worldwide</h3>
<p>Brussels: Sir Mayor Max of Brussels passed away here today at the age of seventy. The name "Mayor Max" will forever remain in the hearts of his friends and former enemies. During the last European War, when he served as Mayor of Brussels, his deeds of bravely resisting the enemy earned him worldwide renown, even respect from the enemy. In 1914, when the German army invaded Brussels, he organized a committee to assist refugees in the midst of the war and control the rise in food prices, ensuring that the people had no worries about food. He also hastily set up aid stations in various schools and other empty buildings, so that the injured and sick could receive treatment. When German soldiers repeatedly rioted, he personally went to persuade them with reason and quell the riots. On August 17th, he sent the treasures stored in the Brussels city treasury to Antwerp. Three days later, he drove a car with a white flag to Leuven to confer with the commander of the German vanguard, hoping to prevent the recurrence of atrocities as much as possible, because in several towns and villages passed by the German army, atrocities were committed at will. During the period of the German occupation of Brussels, he refused to sacrifice his independence to the German Governor-General, and insisted on his dignity as mayor. When the German General Karaszewski first occupied Brussels, he ordered six beds to be set up in the city hall for his staff to rest. He also set up a bed there, firmly refusing to leave the city hall. When the German army in the city issued proclamations to demoralize the people, posting them in the thoroughfares, he also issued proclamations, posting them next to them, encouraging the people, and repeatedly protesting the German infringement of the rights of Brussels citizens. He firmly refused to shake hands with the German general. On one occasion, a German soldier threatened to put him to death because he maintained the circulation of grain coupons. He reported this to the officer in charge and had the soldier punished. Not long after, the German General Karaszewski was transferred elsewhere. On the verge of leaving, he told him that it was a pity that he had not known him before the war and become friends, as he would have been proud to do so. After Karaszewski left, he was replaced by General Lüttwitz, who ordered that all Belgian flags be taken down. He then issued an article, announcing to the public, denouncing this as an unjust act, but submitting to force to avoid bloodshed. At the end of his article, he said, "Let us endure and wait for the day of revenge." The German general was angry and wanted to arrest him, but did not do so. However, his freedom was not maintained for long. Because the Brussels City Hall had issued bonds of 20 million francs to purchase grain, and the German Governor-General violated the promise and prohibited the distribution of rations, intending to levy an additional tax of 30 million francs, he notified the banks that the City Hall would no longer guarantee these bonds. As a result, he was arrested on September 24, 1914, and initially detained in Namur, then repeatedly transferred to other places, and even went to Berlin. On November 13, 1918, he escaped from Goslar with a false passport. Two days later, he safely arrived in Brussels, and on November 16th, he was warmly welcomed by the public. He was born in Brussels and graduated from the University of Brussels, receiving a doctorate in law at the age of twenty. He then engaged in journalism. In 1894, he was elected as a provincial councilor, and nine years later, he was elected as a Brussels city councilor. The following year, he was elected as Mayor of Brussels. Three weeks later was his 40th birthday. After he escaped from Germany, he was highly respected by his own country and various foreign countries. China, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and other countries presented him with honorary degrees or medals. In 1934, he was elected as a member of the French Academy of Fine Arts, because he possessed the highest virtues of an administrator and citizen, was unyielding against strong enemies, possessed the courage of a hero, and was kind, intelligent, and resourceful, a perfect combination of benevolence, wisdom, and courage. He was short in stature, with a mustache, a broad forehead, and sharp eyes. He made people feel like they had known him for a long time. Those who loved him were always loved by him, so he was always respected wherever he went. He strove to be humble and did not pursue vanity. Although he had many medals, he did not wear uniforms or display them. He remained the Mayor of Brussels after the war, and continued to be highly praised for his resolute actions. Because he was responsible for maintaining order in the city streets, all parades were prohibited unless permission was obtained in advance. Once, a socialist mayor from another city came to the capital and led a delegation to a certain administrative department to discuss matters. Vehicles filled the road. Because he had not obtained permission from the city government, he ordered the police to disperse the crowd. In 1933, a major bribery case involving police officers occurred. The police chiefs of Brussels and Leuven were both implicated. He took over the police affairs of both places until the entire case was cleared. Almost all clubs and public welfare organizations in Brussels elected him as president. Whenever there were major ceremonies, he personally attended them. He remained unmarried throughout his life. A thoroughfare in Brussels was named after him to commemorate him forever. Such a man is a model for mayors worldwide and should be emulated. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Oslo Convention Countries Expert Meeting</h3>
<p>Copenhagen: Experts from the Oslo Convention countries held their first meeting at the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to discuss various technical issues concerning the protection of neutral rights. It is uncertain how many days the Oslo Convention countries conference will be held, as the issues to be discussed are extremely complex and may take several weeks to conclude. (Haitong, 6th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Revolution Anniversary Propaganda Slogans</h3>
<p>Moscow: Today is the eve of the 22nd anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The Communist Party's organ newspaper, Pravda, recently published "A Letter from the Executive Committee of the Third International to the Workers and Proletariat of the World," with various slogans attached: "Down with imperialist war," "Down with the reactionary forces of capitalism," "Down with those who instigate war, speculators, and plunderers," "Do not support the ruling classes of various countries whose goal is to prolong the war," "We should rise up and fight to stop the unjust and plundering war of imperialism," "Promote peace for the nations of the world that cherish righteousness, and strive for freedom for the workers of the world," "Long live the workers and peasants of the world," "Long live the Soviet Union, the pillar of peace," "Long live the Soviet Union, the center of freedom and socialism," "Long live the Soviet Union, the homeland of the workers of the world."

<h3>Spanish Military Observers European War: Says Germany Will Win</h3>
<p>Rome: According to General Queipo, leader of the Spanish National Army, speaking to the Associated Press reporter here today, Germany will win the current war. "I firmly believe that within a few weeks, Germany will inflict a surprising blow on Britain and France. Germany's current air force is at least twice as large as the combined air forces of Britain and France. As for a long-term war, Germany's preparations are also more sufficient than Britain and France, because Germany's gasoline reserves are enough for three years of use. In addition, Germany also has the support of Soviet warehouses." General Queipo said that this was his personal opinion. General Queipo is currently the chief representative of the Spanish-German-Italian military observation group. On the eve of the outbreak of the European War, his party was in Germany inspecting military affairs, and has now arrived here to inspect Italian military affairs. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>

<h3>British Labour Leader Explains War Policy: To Free Other Countries from Dictatorial Tyranny</h3>
<p>London: Labour leader Greenwood said in a speech last night that Britain's declaration of war was driven by the resolute will to permanently free other countries from the shackles of dictatorship. This decision will inevitably involve great sacrifices, but without this decision, the sacrifice will be human freedom. The sacrifice of life and money is the price that must be paid to eradicate the inhuman dictatorial tyranny in the world. Dictatorship is now gradually destroying the elements of Christian civilization, and Britain cannot ignore this challenge where the existence of non-freedom means the triumph of violence. As for the outcome, there is no doubt. One day when the war ends, not only we, but also Germany and other peoples will enjoy freedom. Future peace will not harbor any resentment towards the people of other countries, nor will it have territorial or political ambitions, but will be a peace worth our current sacrifices.

<h3>British and French Naval Authorities Discuss Cooperation: Mission Accomplished</h3>
<p>Paris: The British Embassy in France recently issued a press release stating that our Naval Minister Churchill, accompanied by the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, came here on the 2nd of this month to discuss naval cooperation between the allied nations of Britain and France for three days, and has completed his mission. Naval Minister Churchill visited French Prime Minister Daladier and Naval Minister Campinchi on the 2nd of this month to conduct talks. On the decided day, he had a long conversation with French Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Darlan, after which Admiral Darlan hosted a banquet. French Commander-in-Chief of National Defense General Gamelin and French Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Vuillemin were also present. That evening, French Naval Minister Campinchi hosted a dinner. French Minister of Blockade Pernot, Minister of Merchant Marine Chichery, and Foreign Minister Tripoit were also present. Yesterday, he had lunch with General Gamelin, and then visited French Army Chief of Staff General Georges. Today, he had lunch with General Gort, Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, at the British Headquarters. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Western Front Artillery War</h3>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 126, stating, "Yesterday, artillery fire occurred in certain places on the front line." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command recently declared that there were only slight reconnaissance activities and artillery fire in certain strongholds on the Western Front. A French aircraft came to the German positions for reconnaissance and was shot down by a German fighter. (Haitong, 6th)</p>
<h3>German Submarine Sinks During Sea Trials</h3>
<p>Paris: According to news from Zürich as reported in the French press, a German submarine sank during sea trials in Bremerhaven harbor on November 4th. By the time it was salvaged, all the crew members had perished. It is said that the cremation of the bodies was kept strictly secret, and the ashes were later sent to their families. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Swedish Territorial Waters: Three Miles vs. Four Miles, Germany and Sweden Clash</h3>
<p>Stockholm: The German government yesterday notified the Swedish government that the territorial waters of your country should be limited to three miles from the coast. The Swedish government immediately submitted a reply, reserving all rights. In addition to agreeing with this measure, the local newspapers also protested to Germany, saying that the coastline of this country is winding and tortuous, which is different from other countries. Large ships often cannot navigate within three miles of the coast. Therefore, since 1779, this country has decided that territorial waters should be limited to four miles from the coast. It is surprising that the German government now denies this old custom of 160 years. Both Dagens Nyheter and Svenska Dagbladet stated that "The territorial waters of Sweden are limited to four miles from the coast. Germany originally respected this during the last European War. If this precedent is overturned, the shipping industry of Sweden will inevitably suffer a major blow, and it contradicts the guarantees provided by the German government when the war broke out, namely the guarantee from the Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, Admiral Raeder, and the Minister of Aviation, General Göring, that Germany is willing to respect the foreign trade rights of the Scandinavian countries. The actions of the German government in this regard may have a negative impact on the current commercial negotiations between Germany and Sweden." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Danes in German Territory Conscripted into the Army</h3>
<p>Copenhagen: According to a local newspaper in North Schleswig, the Danish minority in the German territory of the Schleswig border has been mostly conscripted and incorporated into the German army. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Hungarian Leaflets Found in Vienna</h3>
<p>Budapest: Anti-Hungarian leaflets were found in the streets of Vienna today, depicting a German soldier holding a piece of bread and a Hungarian girl carrying a basket full of bread, with the slogan "How long can we tolerate this?" attached below the picture. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Germany Rejects Polish Jews</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to the "National News" here today, the census of the Jewish population in Poland was completed on October 29. At the same time, the newspaper predicted that the Jews in Poland would soon be deported, because Jews are not only an obstacle to the Germans, but also an obstacle to the Poles. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Release Statistics on Merchant Ship Losses: 56 Ships Since the Start of the War</h3>
<p>London: According to responsible sources released today, when the European War broke out, there were a total of 18.5 million tons of British merchant ships sailing at sea. In the nine weeks since the start of the war, 56 ships have been sunk by German submarines or by hitting mines, with a total tonnage of 238,000 tons. The losses are less than 1.5 percent, which shows the limited power of German submarines. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London: Officials recently declared that in the most recent week, from October 28 to November 4, only three British merchant ships were sunk, totaling 18,000 tons, which is a significant reduction compared to the 11 ships lost in the first week of the war, totaling 64,000 tons. On the other hand, the target of German submarine attacks is British merchant ships. Only six French merchant ships have been sunk, and the total number of merchant ships from neutral countries that have been sunk is only 32. This can be seen from this. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The talks between the German ambassador to Moscow and the German government have ended. The German ambassador to Italy returned to Berlin for a short stay for a few days, and returned to his post last night. Foreign newspapers reported that the German ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, returned to the Turkish capital from Berlin, took a short rest in the capital of Yugoslavia on the way, and took the opportunity to have political talks with Yugoslav politicians. The German authorities deny this. The foreign spokesperson stated to foreign journalists today that the Swedish newspaper reported that Germany had indicated to the Soviet Union and Finland that it was willing to mediate, and suggested to the Soviet Union that instead of establishing a military base in Hanko Harbor, it could establish a military base in Uto Island. These are all unfounded words and cannot be believed. (Haitong, 6th)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Emphasize American Policy</h3>
<p>Berlin: The Berlin newspapers today attach great importance to the US government's change of policy and the repeal of the arms embargo, and say that US President and Secretary of State Hull had repeatedly stated in previous years that if the ban was lifted during wartime, neutrality would be in danger. German officials believe that the American rumor that the German government will submit a formal protest to the US government is not to be believed. (Haitong, 6th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Steamer Arrives in Kobe</h3>
<p>Kobe: The Soviet ship "Shaposteroy" arrived in Kobe this afternoon. Its purpose is to unload rubber and tin from an Australian ship. Soviet cargo ships have not sailed to Japanese ports for a long time. (Haitong, 6th)</p>
<h3>South Country Minister of Commerce to Visit Budapest</h3>
<p>Budapest: It was learned from Yugoslav communications received here that the Yugoslav Minister of Commerce, Onderj, will pay a return visit to Budapest in the near future to discuss the terms of the commercial treaty between the two countries.

<h3>Romanian-Hungarian Relations</h3>
<p>Bucharest: Romanian Minister of Minorities Drăgomir recently delivered a speech in Arad, discussing the issue of minorities in Romania. He said, in brief, that Romania is determined to maintain its territorial integrity and respect the status of the Hungarian minority in Romania. The government is very satisfied with the Hungarian minority's efforts to adapt to Romania's national conditions. Speaking of the relationship between Romania and Hungary, it has a history of hundreds of years, and their fates are the same. In the future, they should help each other, closely cooperate, and carry each other forward. (Haitong, 6th)</p>
<h3>Italy Pays Attention to Romanian-Turkish Talks</h3>
<p>Rome: The political circles here are paying close attention to the talks between Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and the Romanian ambassador in Ankara. It is reported that this talk is related to Article 4 of the Anglo-French-Turkish mutual assistance pact, which seeks to obtain military assistance from Romania. (Haitong, 6th)</p>

<p>Dublin: A public demonstration was held in Dublin today. When the leaders were about to deliver speeches to the public, the police arrived after hearing the news and dispersed the gathered crowd without making any arrests. (Haitong, 6th)</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Appoints Deputy Minister of Transportation</h3>
<p>Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently appointed Marinelli as Deputy Minister of Transportation, responsible for managing postal and telecommunications affairs. Marinelli joined the Fascist Party as a member in 1919. (Haitong, 6th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Strengthens Economic Warfare Efforts: Provincial Bank Plans Fuzhou and Quanzhou Branches, Trading Company Expands Southeast Operations</h3>
<p>Fuzhou News: Since the outbreak of the war, Fujian Province has established two companies, one for trade and one for transportation, to manage the unified control of trade and transportation within the province. The export of tea, timber, paper, sugar, tung oil, etc., is all under the control of the trading company. The import of matches, cotton yarn, pigments, and hardware is also under planned control. At the same time, the Finance and Trade Committee has also established an office in the province to handle the settlement of foreign exchange from the export of local products. However, due to the evacuation of the population, coastal financial institutions and trade organizations have retreated inland. Now that the Japanese military operations have made no progress, they have changed their plans and adopted economic offensives in the occupied areas and coastal areas. The targets in Fujian are the four prefectures of Zhang (Zhangzhou), Quan (Quanzhou), Fu (Fuzhou), and Xing (Xinghua), colluding with bad elements to smuggle private goods and opium for import, and buying gold and rice for export, using Xiamen and Pingtan as bases for this economic offensive. Companies are established by Japanese and Taiwanese to handle this. Although the authorities have issued orders for strict anti-blockade measures, it is difficult to ensure thorough prevention due to the vast coastal area and numerous harbors. Therefore, there are now plans to expand financial institutions, restore trade organizations, and strengthen economic power in important coastal locations to resist the Japanese offensive. The Provincial Bank's planned establishment of Fuzhou and Quanzhou branches, and the Trading Company's organization of Minnan and Mindong companies are all for this reason, and are currently underway. Recently, the Provincial Government also received the "Outline of Measures for Purchasing Assets in Guerrilla Areas" issued by the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters of the 囗th War Zone, ordering immediate implementation to counter economic aggression. It has already instructed the Provincial Bank and sent a letter to the Fujian Office of the Trade Committee to implement it promptly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Repeatedly Harass Northern Jiangsu, Bombing Linze, Shagou, and Caodian, Resulting in Civilian Casualties and Destruction of Houses</h3>
<p>For days, the Japanese Air Force has been extremely active in the areas east of the Grand Canal, constantly conducting reconnaissance and bombing. The casualties among the people and the destruction of houses are countless. On the 27th, eight Japanese planes, after 10:00 AM, bombed Shagou and Linze in batches, indiscriminately. First, three Japanese planes were spotted over Linze, circling for reconnaissance before dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns. Afterwards, they flew elsewhere and soon returned to drop bombs again. In total, more than a dozen bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped, resulting in over thirty civilian casualties and the destruction of over a hundred houses. Four to five Japanese planes flew over Shagou, dropping around twenty bombs (including incendiary bombs) in four waves within two hours, resulting in two civilian casualties and the destruction of over two hundred houses. Taojialin, northwest of Shagou, was also hit by two bombs. At the same time, they constantly flew to Qin Nan Cang, Wuyou Gang, Men, Sheyang, Jiang Ying, and Dazong Lake for reconnaissance, and finally gathered at San Duo at 11:20 AM, flying towards Gaoyou via Yigou. The Xinghua air defense authorities issued an air raid alert at 10:06 AM on the 27th. Because Japanese planes flew into the territory twice and then turned back, two emergency alerts were issued, which were lifted after about an hour. After 10:00 AM on the 28th, three Japanese planes dropped three or four bombs on Taojialin and two bombs on Shagou. Wangzhigang was harassed twice, with over ten bombs dropped. In addition to the destruction of dozens of houses, there were also civilian casualties. At the same time, two to three Japanese planes flew over Huduo, Qin Nan Cang, Xi'an Feng, Jiang Ying, and Linze, circling for reconnaissance.</p>
<p>East of Huaibao, Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to intrude. Although Cheqiao and Caodian were once occupied, they were later recovered by Chinese troops. Recently, Japanese troops have dispatched planes to bomb continuously. On the 21st, three Japanese planes bombed Caodian, Xudian, Cuibao, and Wangjiazhuang several times, dropping over twenty bombs, killing several civilians and destroying dozens of houses. At 1:50 PM on the 29th, three Japanese planes were spotted over Caodian again, circling for reconnaissance before flying to Fenggu Village for reconnaissance and then towards Funing.</p>
<h3>Panic over Subsidiary Currency in Northern Jiangsu: Market Feels Extremely Illiquid</h3>
<p>Rugao News: Recently, subsidiary currency has become extremely scarce in villages and towns in Northern Jiangsu. At the beginning of the year, the Japanese puppets greatly absorbed copper coins from the market, making small-scale transactions quite difficult. However, general transactions could still be maintained. In the past two months, small denomination banknotes have also become scarce, and there are no stamps to alleviate the situation. Therefore, the market feels illiquid. Recently, even one-yuan legal tender notes have become rare commodities. Only five-yuan legal tender notes are circulating. Often, a five-yuan note is used to buy shoes worth two yuan and fifty cents, but stores cannot provide change, so the purchase fails. Currently, the people of Northern Jiangsu are eagerly awaiting central government relief, as the local county administrations have no relief measures. The Rugao County government recently plans to issue one- and two-corner circulating notes as a remedy, but it has not yet been implemented.</p>
<h3>Despite Good Autumn Harvest, Wuxi Already Feels Rice Shortage: Supply Unsmooth, Procurement Difficult</h3>
<p>Wuxi News: Wuxi is one of the four major rice markets in the country. Although it is not a rice-producing area, it is the distribution center for rice from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. In the past, rice came from areas such as Jin, Li, Wu, Yi, Cheng, Dan, and Ji in Southern Jiangsu, as well as Wu, Chao, Luan, Xiaoxi, Dangtu, and Caishi in Northern and Southern Anhui. Before the war, with ample financial resources and numerous warehouses, rice storage often reached two to three million shi. Even during the lean season, there were at least several hundred thousand shi in storage, so it was possible to regulate surpluses and deficits with confidence. Although fluctuations in rice prices were unavoidable, there was rarely a risk of sudden price increases or decreases, ensuring price balance and food security for the people. After the war, financial resources were exhausted and supplies dwindled, leading to the closure of warehouses. The amount of storage is less than one-tenth of what it used to be. Since the Japanese ban on transportation this summer, supplies have become even scarcer, with only a few arriving. Although there were still 300,000 shi of stored grain at that time, it has been gradually depleted with daily consumption. Recently, the storage amount is only around 10,000 to 20,000 shi. Compared to the population of Wuxi County, this amount is truly insufficient. Since the early rice harvest in Anhui Province, rice merchants have flocked to Wuhu, Dangtu, Caishi, and other places to purchase as much as possible, hoping to transport it to Wuxi and lower rice prices, ensuring food security for the people. However, the local Japanese puppet troops suddenly prohibited rice from leaving the area and notified the merchants that they must have a procurement permit from the destination to transport rice. The rice merchants returned, having spent much effort. They managed to obtain two procurement permits from the Japanese special affairs agency in Suzhou and purchased 10,000 shi of rice in Wuhu. There are still 70,000 shi of rice waiting to be transported from Dangtu, Caishi, Chao County, and other places, but the Japanese are refusing to issue permits. In this situation, how can storage be sufficient, and how can rice prices be lowered? Although the autumn harvest in various places has already begun, procurement is difficult, and traffic is blocked in Yili and other counties, cutting off supplies. Therefore, the coming rice shortage is truly unimaginable.</p>

<h3>War-Time European Marches (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent from London, Shu Di</p>
<p>The realization of this most ideal situation, in the case of Poland, we can give it a name, which is: "Wealth and Honor Both."</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a very risky strategy! What if this assessment fails? Therefore, in response, Poland has its second strategy, which is, using a fabricated name: "Good Fortune in Misfortune."</p>
<p>Shortly before Hitler attacked Poland, he loudly threatened Poland: "If Poland continues like this, I am afraid that this new country of more than twenty years will write the last chapter of its history." Indeed, Hitler's most ingenious thing is "winning by short battles"; however, if he fails to win by short battles, he makes a major decision to eliminate Poland, then, apart from other international changes, in terms of military strength, everyone generally agrees that he can achieve it. In this way, for Poland, it cannot but be regarded as a temporary disaster. However, it also clearly recognized this possibility, and resolutely shouldered the cross of sacrifice, not hesitating to seek the final benefit in the greatest disaster, which is the highest plan of the Polish authorities to finally respond to the war this time.</p>
<p>Poland estimated that after Germany captured Danzig and the "Corridor," if it could not end the war, its second step would certainly be to attack Warsaw, attempting to make an alliance under the city. In that case, Poland prepared to finally abandon its capital and continue to fight Germany. Therefore, Poland's second and most important line of defense is east of Warsaw, along the Vistula River, the Bug River, and the San River. Roughly speaking, it starts from Augustów on the eastern edge of East Prussia, passes through Brest, passes through Deblin, and goes all the way to Krakow. Poland estimated that Germany, at most, absolutely could not cross this line if it did not want to conflict with the Soviet Union. Moreover, even on such a line, when fighting broke out, what was felt to be unsafe was not only Poland itself; in the south, there were countries such as Romania, in the east, there was the Soviet Union, and in the north, there were the Baltic countries. These countries, at that time, would naturally rise up one after another to resist Germany's advance.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Western Europe, it has the allied powers of Britain and France!</p>
<p>Of course, at that time, a great war would absolutely break out. In such a great war, Poland believes that Germany will definitely be defeated in the end. Therefore, even if Poland suffers sacrifices in the process, in the end, at a conference table where a participating country disposes of the defeated country—Germany—Poland will definitely be a major player, and when disposing of Germany's future territory, Poland can also get a little territorial benefit from Germany. At that time, Danzig's incorporation into Poland is of course not a problem; East Prussia is also of course incorporated; even, if possible, it can extend its influence into the territory of Germany proper, all the way to the areas east of the Oder River.</p>
<p>Assuming that the first ideal is realized, then the first-class powers of Europe in the future are Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, and Poland. If the second ideal is realized, then the first-class powers in the future are Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland (whether Italy is still a first-class power depends on which side it participates in). Poland's current authorities are calculating in this way.</p>
<p>It should be added here: the Polish authorities do not believe that Italy will always be inseparable from Germany in a great war; and if Italy also fights alongside Germany, then its fate should be the same as Germany's, and it will be defeated together.</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Union, even with the signing of the "Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact," Poland does not believe that it will stand idly by to the end. In any case, the assistance of armaments—at least trade—is absolutely possible. Until the eve of this great war, what it was most worried about was still Britain's attitude. Therefore, when Britain expressed its absolute fulfillment of the mutual assistance agreement to the end and announced the terms of the agreement, at this time, Poland felt that it could fight with confidence. Also, regarding the Balkan Peninsula countries, especially Romania, it believes that it absolutely cannot sit idly by and watch Poland's defeat. And, with Britain and France participating in the war, and with the Soviet Union assisting Poland, it believes that all the Balkan Peninsula countries, led by Romania and Turkey, will mostly automatically rise up and join the side of the British, French, and Polish allied forces. (If Italy helps Germany, perhaps Yugoslavia will be the only exception.) What is the strength of this group of Balkans? General estimates are about six million!</p>
<p>It is precisely because Poland's aspiration and determination to respond to the war are so thorough that when Britain and France declared war on Germany, the door to a German-Polish compromise, with Poland's submission as its content, was finally closed! From now on, Poland has embarked on a path of betting its national fortune on a single throw! (September 6) (The End)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Offending Guangdong Assemble Along the Leizhou Peninsula, Vainly Attempting to Invade Southern Guangdong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong News: Recently, the Japanese troops offending Guangdong have assembled a large number of warships along the Leizhou Peninsula, and Japanese ships in the Pearl River are also heading to that area in a steady stream. As of October 26, there were more than twenty ships distributed in the area of Guantou Ridge, Longmen Port, Qisha, and Sandunsha. On the other side of the Leizhou Peninsula, in Haikou, Hainan Island, there were also sixty to seventy motorboats of various sizes. On the highway from Haikou to Qiongshan County, there were more than a thousand newly arrived Japanese troops. These Japanese troops will likely be used to invade southern Guangdong. Also, from October 22 and 23, Japanese planes and warships have been constantly shelling and bombing Hepu, Fangcheng, Beihai, and other places, secretly measuring water depths and placing buoys. Therefore, in the past week, the situation in that area has become tense. However, it cannot be predicted whether the Japanese will launch a full-scale invasion or if this is still a threat and containment tactic. However, the mountains of southern Guangdong are overlapping, and transportation is blocked. All highways have been thoroughly destroyed. Not only will the Japanese mechanized units have no place to use their forces, but even ordinary infantry carrying light weapons will have difficulty moving. Therefore, it is difficult for the Japanese army to succeed in invading that area.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Occurs in Changzhou, Japanese Troops Call for Reinforcements from Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suzhou News: On the 22nd of last month, all the key points in the four suburbs of Changzhou were recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops in Changzhou City were greatly panicked and urgently called for reinforcements from the Guangye unit here. Upon receiving the news, the Japanese troops stationed in Suzhou immediately mobilized Japanese troops from the four counties of Xi, Cheng, Yu, and Kun to rush to Changzhou. On the 23rd and 24th, they engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army in Xiaxi, Jiaze, Huangli, and Dong'an, etc., in the southwest of Changzhou. Among these places, the battle in Huangli was the fiercest. Huangli is the gateway to Changzhou, and its gain or loss is of great importance to Changzhou. Therefore, the Japanese army did its best to cope with it. In order to avoid major sacrifices, the Chinese army abandoned the plan to attack Huangli. In these battles, the Japanese army had a force of seven regiments, but as a result, the Chinese army, with its relaxed and waiting formation, gained the advantage. At the moment, the Chinese army is still reorganizing its troops in order to launch another attack on Changzhou.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Installation of Gate Barriers in All Streets and Alleys, Japanese Troops Fear Attacks by Chinese Army</h3>
<p>Suzhou News: Recently, the Chinese mobile units inside and outside the city of Suzhou have been very active. For example, the punishment of the puppet Dong Sun Zhuoren on the 25th of last month and the assassination of the puppet civil affairs official Feng Runzhen on the 27th are proof of this. Currently, the Japanese army is sincerely afraid that the Chinese mobile units will attack the urban area. Therefore, starting from the first of this month, it has forced the puppet police bureau to install strong gate barriers in the streets and alleys and strictly ordered the closure of desolate and remote alleys. In the key areas, the Japanese army and puppet police are increasing patrols and watchmen.</p>
<p>Also, from dawn to 2:00 PM on the 2nd, the Japanese army suddenly imposed an emergency curfew inside and outside the city and prohibited pedestrians and vehicles from passing. As for the reason for the curfew, it cannot be known as the Japanese side refused to announce it. According to general speculation, it is largely related to the recent fighting in Changzhou.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Actively Promoting Education in Shanxi Province Amidst Hardship and Suffering: Establishing Six to Seven Hundred Elementary Schools Under Fire, Changing Elementary School to Four-Year System to Adapt to Needs</h3>
<p>(Western Shanxi News) Although the ten counties of the Sixth Administrative District of Western Shanxi have been occupied for more than a year, they continue to promote education with all their efforts. The current situation of education in the area is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>School Education</p>
<p>The Sixth Administrative District is geographically the most remote, and transportation is very closed and inconvenient. In the past, education was not very developed. Only in the cities of Linfen and Xi County were there middle schools. Recently, the Sixth District established six district-run middle schools in this area, divided into senior and junior levels. These are currently the highest institutions of learning in Western Shanxi, with a total of about 300 students. They have already started classes on November 1 last year. In addition, a branch school has been established near the Hexi (Fen) Dong office of the Sixth District, educating the youth of the counties in Hedong. A branch school is also being prepared for opening in a certain place in Fenxi, planning to train technical talents to develop the national defense industry. The main focus is still on elementary school education. On average, each district in each county has a two-level elementary school, and there are three to four primary elementary schools in each village. There are currently 600 to 700 elementary schools established under fire in the entire district, and they are still increasing. Compared to some educationally developed places, this number is still very small, because the Sixth District has a total of ten counties. But it must be known that this is a region where cultural education is extremely backward, and today it is in particularly difficult conditions. The Sixth District includes these ten counties: Linfen, Hongtong, Zhao City, Huo County, Lingshi, Fenxi, Xi County, Pu County, Yonghe, and Da Ning. Compared to the five counties along the Tongpu Railway in the front, the results are the best. This is partly because the original cultural level here was relatively high, and there were originally more schools than in other places. In addition to the mandatory Three Principles of the People, the curriculum for elementary schools at all levels mainly includes three types: national language textbooks, arithmetic textbooks, and general knowledge textbooks. In addition, there are also air defense and poison defense knowledge, military training, singing, and other courses, and singing national salvation songs takes up a lot of time. The textbooks are mostly adapted to local conditions and re-edited uniformly. Some are lithographed, and some are mimeographed. Because of the difficulty of printing, education in various places has not yet been completely unified. Now, the Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office of the Sixth District is stepping up the lithographic printing of large quantities. The reason for separately editing and printing textbooks here is that, on the one hand, the textbooks edited and printed in other places are not suitable for the current specific situation and needs, and on the other hand, the postal restrictions in the war zone prevent large-scale transportation from the rear. According to the special environment and actual situation of the district, the form of the war of resistance and the needs, they have temporarily changed the elementary school years to a total of four years: two years for junior elementary and two years for senior elementary. But there is a time when, if work requires it and the students' grades are particularly good, they can also be introduced to national salvation work at any time, or promoted to middle school in advance. Those with poor grades can also reduce their study time.</p>
<p>Several Characteristics</p>
<p>The new education implemented here has several characteristics. First, all textbooks are closely linked to today's work of resisting the war and building the country, creating content for resisting the war and building the country. Even arithmetic teaches elementary school students about the number of foreign horses, airplanes, and cannons, strengthening children's national consciousness. Second, the school authorities do not give students any unreasonable restrictions, do not prohibit students from engaging in various activities that are beneficial to resisting the war, and also lead students in various national salvation and other activities, establishing a democratic and autonomous style. Third, the past system of corporal punishment for students is abolished, eliminating unreasonable discipline and eliminating the past barriers, hatred, and fear that students had for teachers. Teachers and students live together as one. Fourth, adapting to the particularly difficult environment during the war of resistance and national construction, the style of enduring hardship and hard work is established. Teachers do not have good classrooms and desks and chairs, and sometimes lectures are given in the fields or underground. Fifth, they fully promote the spirit of collective learning. Students who study well still automatically lead a collective life after class, organizing small groups, lectures, singing teams, etc. Sixth, linking learning with practice, most elementary school students organize propaganda teams, etc., to work in the countryside after studying, or help the village self-defense team stand guard, patrol, check pedestrians, and other activities. Seventh, in general, the scouting training in schools is changed to more rigorous military training, which is also an important feature of this children's education.</p>
<p>Social Education</p>
<p>Especially since the time when the restoration of governments at all levels began, the training of cadres has also become a very important education work. These trainings are mostly short-term. The most cadres training classes are held by governments at all levels, and the nature is also divided into many types such as administration, education, village heads, neighborhood heads, and village self-defense teams. This is the main purpose of planting training, which is to cultivate and select new cadres, transform backward or fragile cadres, and unify cadres' political understanding and new working style. The work of social education is developing relatively slowly, but everyone has already paid great attention to this work. In general, it is promoted through people's schools, literacy classes, and small organizations of mass groups, and supplemented by public performances of dramas and songs.</p>
<h3>Advancing Vocational Library Has Opened</h3>
<p>The Advancing Vocational Supplementary School at 486 Nanjing Road has 1,800 students this semester, is well-managed, and has a good reputation. In order to promote supplementary education, it has also jointly organized the Advancing Vocational Circulating Library with the China Library Service Society, and held an opening ceremony on the 5th. More than 100 people, including Ding Fubao, Huang Jingwan, Yu Youxin, Xu Wancheng, Chen Jinxian, Chen Yisheng, and Zhou Zhide, attended. The ceremony was led by Principal Lu Jun Qian. Chen Hongfei, Chairman of the China Library Service Society, and Yang Changzhi, manager of the society, reported on the preparation process.

<h3>Handicap Basketball Tournament: Xufang Wins the Championship; Xianle Loses 26-51 Without the Handicap</h3>
<p>The first handicap basketball tournament ended the day before yesterday. After Flying Eagles defeated Nanyang 59-36 (without handicap), the audience had already packed the small court. They eagerly awaited the final between Xufang and Xianle. Both sides fielded their best lineups. As a result, Xufang defeated Xianle 51-26 and won the championship. The key to the victory was the "handicap" in name only. After all, Xufang is a first division team. Their guarding, passing, and shooting were all better than Xianle's. Although Xianle lost, their sportsmanship was fully demonstrated. The performances of both sides were highly praised by the fans. Zou Ziren of Xufang and Chen Wenkui, Li Guang, and Hu Xianying of Xianle wasted too many opportunities, which was also a reason for Xianle's defeat. Xufang's movements changed from slow to fast, and their passing was rarely "leaked," which was commendable. If the team still has these six players join the Sino-Western Youth League, they can beat Hualian Baimen.</p>

<h3>Finance: Intense Competition Between Bulls and Bears in Foreign Exchange; Speculative Selling...Almost Approaching the Exchange Settlement Price; Bank of Japan's Settlement Inflow...More Tight Than Before After Squeezing</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange rates yesterday, as announced by HSBC, saw British gold rise by half a pence, reaching five pence, and the US dollar rose by 8.125, reaching 8.25 yuan. Other currencies also saw a consistent increase. The informal market for British and American currencies continued the momentum from the weekend, aggressively advancing and almost reaching the foreign exchange settlement prices of 6 pence for British gold and 10 yuan for the US dollar. The situation was exceptionally heated. Most operators and speculators seemed less cautious than before, actively preparing to compete. The market price fluctuated greatly, with tight conditions following a sharp decline, which was rare. The morning opening showed a state of British neutrality and American tightness due to the continued reduction of the American and British exchange rates. Afterwards, Chinese merchants and Hong Kong firms aggressively sold off, and many parties, seeing the unfavorable situation, also cut their positions. However, those entering the market to seek goods were rare. As a result, the disparity between buyers and sellers was significant. In less than half an hour, British gold rose to 5.8875 pence, and the US dollar also rose to 9.75 yuan. Subsequently, due to improved absorption by HSBC and the American Bank, the Bank of Japan took the opportunity to buy heavily, causing the price to soften to 5.5625 pence and 9.125 yuan in a short time. Then, due to the resurgence of Chinese merchants and the intensification of selling pressure, British gold rebounded to 5.71875 pence, and the US dollar also softened to 9.4375 yuan. However, the Bank of Japan's buying interest soon re-emerged, coupled with the relatively strong appetite of HSBC and other foreign banks, and the Hong Kong telegram also reversed from selling to buying. Therefore, by the noon close, the British gold was re-calculated at 5.53125 pence, and the US dollar was 9.125 yuan. In the afternoon, HSBC, the American Bank, and the Hong Kong telegram continued to absorb, briefly tightening the price to 5.375 pence and 8.875 yuan. Afterwards, the buying momentum dissipated, and the situation stabilized. By the close, British gold was 5.4375 pence, and the US dollar was 9 yuan, slightly softer by 0.125 and tighter by 0.25 compared to last Saturday.

In less than half an hour, British gold rose to 5.875 pence, and the US dollar also rose to 9.75 yuan. During that period, HSBC and other foreign banks, such as Bank of China, bought in at soft prices. The HSBC listing revealed an increase of half a pence for British gold and a large increase of 8.125 for the US dollar. The silver balancing tax listing did not change. Afterwards, the Bank of Japan suddenly took advantage of the low prices to settle, and HSBC and a certain American bank also had buying interest, causing the market to soften. At 9:50 AM, British gold had softened to 5.5625 pence, and the US dollar had also tightened to 9.125 yuan. Subsequently, due to the resurgence of Chinese merchants and the transfer of appetite from the buying side, the price trend became loose and hard again. British gold hardened again to 5.71875 pence, and the US dollar softened to 9.4375 yuan. Soon, HSBC took the opportunity to absorb again, and the Bank of Japan also came to force, and it was heard that the Hong Kong telegram had also returned to the market. Therefore, another softening was seen. Extended to noon close, the bank spot selling price, British gold had softened to 5.53125 pence, and the US dollar had also contracted to 9.125 yuan. It was heard that after the close, British gold softened again to 5.5 pence, and the US dollar tightened again to 9.0625 yuan.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Unfavorable Environment from Multiple Sides, Yarn Market Price Decline Rekindles</h3>
<p>The price decline in the yarn market has begun again, and the situation is very weak. This is due to sluggish actual sales, prolonged foreign exchange extensions, and a blow to confidence. In particular, it has demoralized the bulls, and market conditions are declining daily. Most colleagues have a large amount of goods in hand and have suffered too much losses, so they are temporarily unwilling to sell at a loss. Furthermore, raw cotton prices are falling slowly. Therefore, although yarn prices are falling, the fluctuations are very frequent. In reality, the base is not as high as it used to be, so there is great resistance to downward movement. The fundamental problem is still struggling with actual sales.</p>
<p>Currently, the mood is scattered among yarn traders, because the environment is unfavorable from multiple sides and buyers from Guangdong are not actively purchasing. The opening price immediately dropped ten yuan, with 20-count "Double Horse" yarn priced at 630 yuan. News then spread that the issuance of drafts was becoming looser, and gold prices fell, which caused a temporary weakness, and prices fell another ten yuan, with a low price of 620 yuan. Shortly after, foreign exchange tightened, and confidence was restored. The closing price of "Double Horse" yarn was 624 yuan. According to the half-day trading statistics, 1,095 bales were traded. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell 14 yuan, "Shepherd" yarn fell 5 yuan, "Special Jincheng" yarn fell 9 yuan, and "Tiannu" yarn fell 10 yuan. The Yong'an Factory released 100 bales of 20-count "Special Jincheng" yarn at a price of 630 yuan. Today, 190 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 255 bales to Hong Kong, 15 bales to Guangzhou Bay, 65 bales to Beihai, and 20 bales to Haikou. The volume of purchases made by various groups is listed below:</p>
<p>Fellow traders: 585 Hong Kong: 230</p>
<p>Ningbo: 50 Xiamen: 20</p>
<p>Inland: 20 Fuzhou: 30</p>
<p>Jiangxi: 30 Total: 1,090</p>
<h3>Shenxin Factory Begins Ordering American Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton trade remains as dull as ever. Factories are unusually slow to take delivery, mainly because yarn prices are not improving and the outlets are very narrow. As a result, they have no intention of purchasing raw materials for the time being. According to news from a certain cotton industry organization, Japanese merchants purchased a very large amount of American cotton a few days ago, and the price was cheaper than Indian cotton. Japanese factories are even less eager to absorb Chinese cotton. Yesterday, the Yong'an Factory traded 1,000 bales of Tongzhou cotton, with prices falling slightly more than two yuan. The supply from Northern Jiangsu included 2,401 bales of "arrived at Tong cotton", 1,322 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 1,930 bales of Beisha cotton. Today, 50 bales were shipped to Guangzhou Bay. The current trading prices for cotton are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tongzhou cotton: 132.00 Yong'an 1,000 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou cotton: 127.00 Gold Traders 1</p>
<p>128.00 50 bales</p>
<p>Separately, in Shanghai, the foreign cotton trade has recently become increasingly active. Chinese and foreign factories have also gradually begun to take action. Trade among colleagues is also quite active. The purchases are all for American cotton. Yesterday, Shenxin also started to take action and ordered several thousand bales of American cotton. Other factories have also placed considerable orders. However, there have been no reports of any trades in Indian cotton.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market showed a firm state from the beginning of the morning. The weather reports from the cotton regions were bad, and statistics on cloth sales increased sharply, which stimulated active trading in spot goods. Overseas cotton merchants were very aggressive in buying on the market, especially Indian traders. As a result, cotton prices rose, and the closing prices were 4 to 10 points higher than the previous day. Indian cotton futures also rose more than 2 rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose more than 10 points.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Rumors of Large Shipments of Domestic Sugar Arriving</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to sources at Jardine Matheson, Dutch coarse white sugar was at 6.90, and because foreign exchange remained loose, the trend was still weak. The guild’s price quotation for spot goods was: 24 coarse white sugar for May arrival of old goods – this firm was only at 48 yuan; other firms initially did 48.5 yuan, then 49 yuan, slightly more than 1 yuan lower than before. The price decrease for Taikoo granulated sugar was similar; "H Mark" was at 53 yuan, with only a few thousand bags traded. Lower-grade "DY Mark" was at 50.20 yuan, and "HX Mark" was at 49.5 yuan. As rumors spread that large shipments of Shantou sugar were arriving, the domestic sugar market turned flat, and no transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Southern Specialties: White Lotus Root Loosening</h3>
<p>The origin of Lanxi white lotus root previously required foreign exchange settlement, which was blocked in Ningbo. After the Chamber of Commerce requested it, it has been approved for exemption from settlement, so there has been a slight transfer to Ningbo. At the same time, Wenzhou shipping has also been restored, with dozens of barrels also transferred, so the market has softened. It is expected to drop by more than ten yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Stockpilers Eager to Sell, Fine Cloth Prices Drop Sharply</h3>
<p>The cloth market is experiencing a strong loosening of foreign exchange, and the minds of colleagues and stockpilers are wavering. They are all aiming to quickly sell off their inventory, and the selling prices are quite loose and excessive. White goods, fine cloth and fine twill have fallen by 20 to 30 cents per piece. Local factory coarse cloth and coarse twill have fallen by 5 to 10 cents. However, Jardine Matheson coarse cloth, due to strong demand from customer groups, still maintains firm asking prices. The asking prices for bleached and dyed printed fabrics are extremely uneven, generally falling by 10 to 30 cents per piece. Wenzhou and Ningbo merchants have a large accumulation of goods waiting to be shipped due to slow ship traffic. Therefore, new trading demand has slightly declined. Transactions included a hundred or so pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, and colored twill. Fujian merchants bought fifty to sixty boxes of colored twill, and Yunnan merchants bought more than three thousand pieces of colored cloth, flannel, and colored twill. Local merchants traded more than five thousand pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and flannel. Retail sales are currently quite good.</p>
<p>Yesterday, both white and colored piece goods continued to decline in the East Piece Goods Market. In the morning market, 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth plummeted to 18 yuan per piece. "Four Gentlemen" yuan serge was at 59.5 cents per yard. In the afternoon market, colleagues with bullish sentiments temporarily boosted prices in the market. "Dragon Head" cloth rose back to 18.40 yuan, and serge reached 60 cents. Ultimately, due to the sluggish market sentiment, prices fell again. At closing, "Dragon Head" fine cloth was at 18.15 yuan, falling 80 cents from last week. Other mid-to-low grade brands of fine cloth also fell by 30 to 50 cents. Fine twill fell by 20 to 35 cents per piece. The current quoted price for "Dragon Head" baby cloth is 17.25 yuan, with only more than 400 pieces traded in this market.</p>
<p>On the 7th, 27 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Haikou, 116 pieces to Haiphong, 65 pieces to Beihai, 12 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 19 pieces to Hong Kong, 100 pieces to Yantai, and 75 pieces to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Gray Overcoat Fabrics are Popular</p>
<p>Light gray overcoat fabrics have recently become popular again. Most suits and overcoats are now choosing this fabric. Tailor shops in this market all have stock of Zhao Ji and Lao Gong Mao foreign firms' brands, and buyers are especially in demand. The wholesale price is 15.50 yuan per yard, and the retail price is 16.25 yuan. The briskness of the market is almost on par with pure wool overcoat fabrics costing 20 yuan per yard. The sales of pure wool fine twill, floral, and herringbone Polish overcoat fabrics costing 20 yuan per yard are especially strong, with supply unable to meet demand.</p>
<h3>Metals: Tin Rebounds After Fatigue</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the gradual increase in sales from various regions, tin merchants in this market are unwilling to sell easily due to supply disruptions. The current market price for refined tin (99.9% purity) is 1,200 yuan per dan; 99.75% purity is 1,100 yuan per dan (but these two grades are very scarce in the current market); 99.5% purity (this is the most common grade on the market) is 1,000 yuan per dan. The asking price for small ingot tin is 930+ yuan per dan. In addition, the market prices for Jianghua tin, Hengdi tin, Dou tin, and Fuzu tin have not changed much due to quiet trading.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Futures and Spot Prices Rebound; Local Silk Trading is Cautious</h3>
<p>New York was closed on Sunday. Yokohama silk prices strengthened, with spot goods at 1,855 yuan, up 5 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 1,890 yuan, up 35 yuan. November futures opened in the morning at 1,857 yuan, up 4 yuan, and closed at 1,900 yuan, up 43 yuan. Forward contracts were at 1,829 yuan, up 10 yuan, and the closing price was 1,865 yuan, up 36 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign firms in the local silk market have not yet started, and the foreign silk market is also uncertain. Therefore, both buyers and sellers in the domestic market are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>Needle-Shaped Green Tea Sales to Europe are Uniquely Smooth</p>
<p>The trading of green tea by foreign firms in this market has recently declined due to the continued strengthening of foreign exchange. The value of high-priced Zhenmei and Zhu teas has fallen. However, because there were not many needle-shaped teas exported in the past, foreign demand is still strong, and sales are uniquely smooth. Yesterday, Tongfu, Jinlong, Baolong, and other firms bought more than 260 boxes, and market prices ranged from 83 yuan to 115 yuan, with relatively stable prices.</p>
<p>Today, 500 pieces of tea were shipped to Tianjin, 19 pieces to Hong Kong, and 8 pieces to Haiphong.</p>

<h3>The 45th Division of the Chinese Army Fiercely Attacks Japanese Troops on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway; High-Speed Marching Prevents Japanese Reinforcements from Arriving in Time; Japanese Casualties Number in the Hundreds Over Two Days and Nights; Japanese Instructor Injured in Battle in Nanhui County</h3>
<p>The triangular area within the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Suzhou-Jiaxing railways spans the borders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Because it is a land of crisscrossing rivers and swamps, mobile Chinese army units are ferrying across the Qiantang River to the north bank and continuously entering to replenish forces. Therefore, the current number of personnel is sufficient to break through any Japanese stronghold on the railway. Since the last time a large force encircled and annihilated the Japanese troops at Fengjing Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and destroyed two bridges, Xitang Town, more than 30 li west of Fengjing, was regarded as a guerrilla base and suffered a major disaster. Civilians died under bullets and bayonets, and many houses in the town were destroyed. Although the Chinese army was not attacked, they all vowed to do their best to avenge the people of Xitang.</p>
<p>Chinese Forces Attack with Swift Tactics</p>
<p>Between the 2nd and 3rd of this month, the Tian division of the 45th Chinese Army, which was scattered along the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border and on the shores of Dian Lake (it is said that the previous attack on Fengjing and destruction of the two bridges was also carried out by the Tian division), marched at high speed, passed through the foothills of Tianma Mountain, and advanced towards Songjiang County. One unit bypassed the Sisong Highway, rushed near the Mingxing Bridge, and engaged the Japanese army in a fierce battle north of the railway. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented, and Songjiang County was almost surrounded. Commander Tian, ​​wearing several car tires, took the lead. A bullet hit his chest, embedding itself in the tire and not penetrating, so he was not injured. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops retreated steadily.</p>
<p>Brief Assault on Mingxing Bridge Station</p>
<p>Mingxing Bridge Station was almost recaptured. The Songjiang Japanese garrison, the Fuji Department, urgently telegraphed Shanghai for help. In desperation, the Japanese army dispatched four or five hundred reinforcements by land and water from Pudong Nanhui, Chuansha, and Longhua Minhang areas in western Shanghai to rescue and relieve the siege. However, the Chinese army’s strategy was miraculous. Before the Japanese reinforcements arrived, they captured a large number of war trophies and retreated west. The Japanese army suffered hundreds of casualties in two days and nights, and lost countless military supplies. After the Japanese reinforcements arrived, they did not dare to pursue westward, fearing that the defenses elsewhere would be empty, so they hurriedly returned to their original positions to prevent guerrillas from taking advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Assault on Zha Port Encounters Formidable Opponents</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th, another fierce encounter between Chinese and Japanese troops occurred upstream of Zha Port in Punan. Water traffic at Zha Port was completely cut off. Flights from Shanghai to Jinhui Bridge, Luhui New Market, and other places within Zha Port were forced to return one after another upon arriving at the port. This battle was due to the Japanese discovering that guerrilla leader Fan Gencai had gone to Shanghai on business, so they attempted to deal a heavy blow while he was away. Unbeknownst to them, other military personnel were commanding the operation for the Chinese. At dawn on the morning of the 4th, the Japanese army sent more than 100 soldiers from Pubei, traveling on several speedboats, and charged into Zha Port, carrying out a so-called "mopping-up" operation. Chinese soldiers stationed on the Pudong side of Zha Port discovered this and immediately notified their base. Under an emergency assembly order, they blocked the Japanese forces from three sides west of Lujiahui and north of Jinhui Bridge.</p>
<p>Heavy Casualties on Both Sides After Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>The Japanese troops disembarked and engaged in a fierce battle. The Japanese army was not equipped with steel cannons, using rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades as weapons. Therefore, the Chinese army was not inferior in terms of weapons. Bullets flew thick and fast, like a string of pearls. By noon, both sides had suffered casualties. The Japanese army made no progress. Fearing that their retreat would be cut off, they re-boarded the speedboats and withdrew from Zha Port. Water traffic at Zha Port was restored to its original state from the 5th. According to another account, the battle was caused by the Japanese army seeking revenge for a Japanese soldier who was shot dead by the guerrillas.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Nanhui Attack Erzaohong</p>
<p>Since being unified under the command of Xu Zhidao, the Zhongyi Salvation Army in Pudong has spared no effort in disrupting communications. Therefore, the Japanese side is paying close attention. In the latter half of last month, the Japanese convened a military conference in Nanhui City to discuss their so-called large-scale "mopping-up" plan against Xu's troops. After a decision was made, the Japanese launched an attack on Xu's troops from several routes on the morning of the 27th, coming on strong. Xu's troops discovered this and ordered all units to prepare for battle. At about 8 o'clock, Japanese instructor Takeda led more than 200 Japanese troops, carrying heavy artillery, machine guns, and other sharp weapons, to attack a certain brigade defense area of Xu's troops in Rising Sun Township, and the troops responded immediately. For a time, the fighting was fierce, and the sound of artillery fire filled the air. Nearby villagers fled one after another. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese side received reinforcements from a certain brigade and was encircled from four sides by Xu's troops' Xu, Huang, and Yan brigades. The Japanese army, fearing being surrounded, changed its attack to Erzaohong. Xu's troops also changed their strategy, flanking the Japanese army from both wings. The Japanese army was defeated and retreated in disarray towards Nanhui City. It is said that Japanese instructor Takeda was wounded by a bullet in the battle. Currently, the battle situation between the two sides remains in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Special Security at North Railway Station</p>
<p>From 1 PM yesterday, special security measures were suddenly implemented at the North Railway Station in Zhabei. Pedestrians and vehicles were prohibited from passing along the railway from Xinmin Road to Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, and North Sichuan Road to the east, and to Gonghexin Road to the west. Sentries were heavily deployed along the way. In addition to deploying fifty or sixty armed Japanese naval marines, weapons such as machine guns and small cannons were set up on the north and south platforms of the railway station. The situation was very serious at one point. According to the Japanese side, General Nishio, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, along with his staff officer, Lieutenant General Itagaki, and other staff members, came to Shanghai from Nanjing. However, it remains to be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Preparations for Memorial Service Following the Death of Ma Xiangbo; Aurora College Schedules Memorial Service; Fellow Townsmen in Zhenjiang Telegraphed Condolences Yesterday</h3>
<p>The news of the passing of centenarian Ma Xiangbo in Liangshan, Vietnam, at 3 PM on the 4th has spread to Shanghai, causing widespread mourning. It is reported that condolences have been telegraphed one after another. Regarding the exact time of Ma's death, according to his great-grandson, Zhang Chongren, it was indeed 3 PM on the 4th. The telegram from Chongqing reported it as 6 PM, which may be inaccurate. Currently, the family members who are attending the funeral in Liangshan are only his daughter-in-law, Qiu Renwu, and his granddaughter, Yu Zhang. His grandson-in-law, Xie Wenhua, is in Chongqing, working in an organization with Yu Youren's son. In addition, there are two grandsons, namely Jinghua and Roma, who are currently studying at the Southwest Associated University in Guilin and once served on the front lines. The rumor that all three of them are in Liangshan is incorrect. Therefore, there are very few people handling funeral affairs in Liangshan. I originally intended to travel to Liangshan, but the journey would take 20 days, and there is no way to shorten it, so I had to cancel the trip in order to stay in Shanghai to handle the memorial service.</p>
<p>A telegram from Chongqing on the 6th: Yu Youren of the Supervisory Yuan telegraphed condolences to the family of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, saying, "To the Honorable Widow Yu Zhang, Grandniece, relayed by the Consulate in Hanoi: The death of Master Xiangbo has shocked the world. The flames of Japan are dying, and the revival of China is in sight. Heaven did not spare his life, causing him to not witness the celebratory ceremony, which is truly regrettable. Please accept this telegram of condolences and take comfort. Yu Youren."</p>
<p>Various Groups to Hold Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>Since receiving the telegram from the family of Old Ma, the Danyang Fellow Townsmen Association has telegraphed condolences to Liangshan. Now, knowing that Old Ma is respected for his virtue and age and is universally admired, not only has he devoted himself to national affairs throughout his life, but he has also shown sincere concern for his hometown, they have sent letters to fellow townsmens' associations in Zhenjiang, Liyang, Jintan, and other charitable organizations such as the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, scheduling a tea party at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 3 PM on (8th) to discuss the organization of a preparatory committee and schedule a memorial service to express their sorrow.</p>
<p>Fellow Townsmen in Zhenjiang Telegraph Condolences</p>
<p>"To the Family of Old Ma Xiangbo in Liangshan: Upon receiving the tragic news, we were shocked to learn of Old Ma's sudden passing. Remembering Old Ma's long and virtuous life, upholding the middle path, as a model for his hometown and a teacher for humanity, Heaven did not pity him, depriving us of our virtuous elder, shocking the nation and causing widespread mourning. In addition to joining various groups in Shanghai to hold a memorial service, we hereby telegraph our condolences and express our deepest sorrow. Wu Yunzhai, Chairman of the Zhenjiang Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, Standing Committee Members Tang Shoumin, Chen Peide, Chen Juchuan, Hu Chunlin, et al."</p>
<p>Catholic Faithful Unite in Mourning</p>
<p>Upon learning of the death of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Catholic faithful in Shanghai expressed their grief. Ma was not only a veteran of the party and the country, but also a devout Catholic since childhood, baptized with the Christian name Joseph. Previously, during the drafting of the constitution, he joined Lu Bohong, Zhu Zhiyao, and other leaders of 3 million Catholics nationwide in advocating to the government for religious freedom. He made considerable contributions to the church. Therefore, Catholic organizations in Shanghai, such as the Catholic Action Association, have not only telegraphed condolences to Liangshan, but have also initiated a memorial mass with Catholic rites to show their condolences.</p>
<p>Aurora College Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Aurora College in this city, passed away in Shishan. The school immediately received a telegram and sent a telegram in the name of all faculty, students, and the alumni association to express condolences to the family of Old Ma. They also scheduled a memorial mass at the St. Peter's Church on Rue Luber on Wednesday, the 15th of this month, at 7:30 AM, inviting relatives, friends, and acquaintances of Old Ma to participate in the prayers. The school will also be closed on that day to express their sorrow.</p>
<p>Fudan Discusses Memorial Arrangements</p>
<p>Old Ma was also the founder of Fudan University. After receiving the news of the death of the elder, the school also sent a telegram in the name of all faculty and students to express condolences. They scheduled a meeting convened by the alumni association to discuss memorial arrangements.</p>
<p>The Zhu Brothers Recount Past Events</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published a biography of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, stating that Ma was born in 1839. Yesterday morning, this newspaper's reporter met with Ma Xiangbo's nephews, Zhu Zhiyao and Jilin. According to Mr. Jilin, Ma Xiangbo was born on April 28, 1840, which is the 16th day of the third month of the Gengzi year of Daoguang, not 1839. It was also said that since receiving the news of Old Ma's death, the president of the Aurora College has inquired about another nephew, the current Zhu bishop of Nantong, who is in Shanghai, so that a memorial service can be held. According to Mr. Zhiyao, there are many anecdotes about Old Ma's life. When Aurora College was founded, Zhiyao initially contributed 500 gold pieces to promote its establishment and provided meals and lodging. Old Ma often shared meals and talked with outstanding students. At that time, Mr. Yu Youren had passed the imperial examination and came to Shanghai from Shaanxi to study at Aurora College. Ma greatly favored him. Yu once recorded the "Return Home" essay by the great Confucian Wang Yue of Shaanxi in harmony with Tao Yuanming's poem and presented it to Old Ma, because its words were in line with Catholic doctrines. Old Ma deeply cherished this essay and instructed Yu to write a copy for him. Yu then personally wrote ten large scrolls as a gift and posted them in the Hall of Joy. Old Ma happily collected words from its phrases to write couplets, and Mr. Zhiyao made a new annotation for him.</p>
<h3>Following Strong Negotiations by the Portuguese Consulate, the Tang-Class Portuguese Ship is Released; Tanglu, Tangqiao, and Tangbei Ships Regain Freedom; the Japanese Flag on the Forecastle Has Been Removed and the Ship Will be Docked for Repairs Soon; Damage Has Lasted for More Than Half a Year</h3>
<p>Starting on April 8 of this year, the Japanese naval authorities detained more than a dozen Portuguese merchant ships on the sea off Zhejiang and outside the Wusongkou, forcing them to dock at the Yangshupu River buoy. Each ship was guarded by two armed Japanese sailors, and the Japanese naval flag was hoisted on the bow. After the incident occurred, all Portuguese merchant shipping was suspended. The Portuguese Consulate General repeatedly protested and negotiated, but after more than half a year, little progress was made. Apart from the release of the Hailong, owned by the Atlantic Company, about ten days ago, there has been no news of the release of the other ships. According to information obtained by a Dagong News Agency reporter from the shipping industry, recently, in order to quickly resolve the case and ensure the interests of Portuguese merchants, the Portuguese Consulate General strongly negotiated with the Japanese side. As of last Saturday (the 4th), the Japanese side agreed to release the Tanglu, Tangqiao, and Tangbei ships, and notified the Portuguese Consulate General for verification. The details of the negotiations are not known.</p>
<p>Moving to Dock for Repairs; Soon to Set Sail</p>
<p>The Tang-class ships were originally docked at buoy No. 27 in the Yangshupu River. After the Japanese side notified the approval for their return, all the Japanese sailors stationed on the ships withdrew. The Japanese naval flag hoisted on the foremast was also removed. The China-America Navigation Company dispatched a tugboat at about 10 AM yesterday to tow the three ships to buoys Nos. 33 and 34 in front of the Yangshupu Power Plant, mooring them alongside the Tangsai ship of the company. It is reported that the ships will soon enter the dock to repair the machinery and repaint the hull, and then resume sailing. It is said that the Tangsai and Tanglu ships will first join the Shanghai-Wenzhou route.</p>
<p>Continued Negotiations for the Remaining Ships</p>
<p>A reporter from Dagong News Agency also learned from the shipping industry that among the dozen or so detained Portuguese ships, apart from the Hailong, Tanglu, Tangqiao, and Tangbei ships, which have been released one after another, and the Dade and Lude ships, which were forced to cooperate with the Japanese side and were also released, there are still several ships that are currently detained, including the Meida of the American Company, the Libao and Fulu of the Zhen De Company, and the Fade of the Far East Shipping Company. There are also the Shantay of the Zhen De Company and the Meifa of the American Company, which have also been forced to suspend navigation. It is reported that the Portuguese Consulate General has decided to continue to negotiate on the basis of reason in order to release all ships as soon as possible and resume business.</p>
<p>Hailong Repairs Completed; Route Undecided</p>
<p>The Hailong ship of the Portuguese Atlantic Navigation Company was released on the 21st of last month. It immediately entered the Qiuxin Factory in Nanshi to inspect the hull, then sailed to buoys Nos. 29 and 30 in Yangshupu to paint the hull and cabins. The repairs have now been completed, but the route has not yet been decided, so it is still docked at the Pujiang River. Also, the diesel-powered plywood boats Dade and Lude, after cooperating with the Japanese side and registering with the puppet "Shipping Bureau," were also released by the Japanese side, but the route has not been determined and they have not yet sailed.</p>
<h3>Return Voyage of Sino-Indian Line Steamships, Combining Shanghai-Bay Route; Reduced Vessels, Increased Cargo Turnover; Loading Additional Cargo on Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Sino-Indian line vessels managed by the British company, Apcar &amp; Co., travel according to a schedule. They start from Calcutta, pass through various Southeast Asian locations and Hong Kong, and then arrive in Shanghai. From Shanghai, they go to Japan, then directly to Hong Kong, and return to Calcutta via the original Southeast Asian route. Since the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe, the number of ships on the British company's Europe-Asia route has decreased, but cargo turnover in Southeast Asia remains high. Therefore, the</p>
<p>Apcar Voyage</p>
<p>has been slightly altered. After coming from India to Shanghai and going to Japan, it now returns to Shanghai, where it loads additional cargo before heading to Hong Kong, passing through various Southeast Asian locations, and returning to Calcutta.

<h3>Southeast Asian Capital Concentrates in Shanghai; Rumors of Control Over Hong Kong Dollars</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Europe, although Hong Kong is located in the Far East and has not been significantly affected, the economic situation has clearly changed. Many Chinese who own assets and reside in Hong Kong to avoid the war previously operated businesses there. Since the European war, most of Hong Kong's floating capital has shifted its investment direction. Recently, Shanghai's real estate and other industries have seen a large amount of investment from Hong Kong investors. Shanghai's financial market has also experienced a booming atmosphere due to the concentration of Hong Kong capital in Shanghai. Yesterday, financial circles in this city reported that Hong Kong is preparing to implement controls on the large outflow of capital. If this measure is implemented, people with savings in Hong Kong will be within the scope of the controls. However, the local banking community is still waiting for further news regarding the detailed measures. According to banking sources, remittances from Southeast Asia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places to Shanghai have been quite active recently, which has enlivened the Shanghai financial market.</p>
<h3>Resetting the Market Price of Coal Balls</h3>
<p>Coal balls are one of the necessities of life for citizens. Fluctuations in their price are related to the burden on citizens. However, due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the past and the sudden outbreak of war in Europe, the cost of coal has increased, and the selling price of coal balls was once raised. Now, after deliberation by trade associations, the retail price is set at 3.70 yuan per dan (unit of weight). The current selling price of coal balls can be stabilized and will not increase further. However, the expansion of the European war is closely related to our situation.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the Founding of the U.S. Marine Corps; Admiral Hart Inspects; The 164th Anniversary is This Month on the 10th; The 4th Regiment Stationed in Shanghai Receives Inspection and Flag Presentation</h3>
<p>This month on the 10th is the 164th anniversary of the founding of the United States Marine Corps. The U.S. 4th Marine Regiment is actively preparing to hold a commemoration. At that time, a military exercise will be held at the Racecourse Parade Ground, inspected by Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, and his Chief of Staff, Admiral Connell. During the inspection, Admiral Hart will present the new regimental flag to the soldiers of the U.S. 4th Regiment, who will be dressed in military uniforms. A unit of the Marine Corps Guard will wear specially made military uniforms of various colors, so that the spectators can see the changes in the U.S. Marine Corps military uniforms since 1775. The military exercise will be held that day, commanded by the current Commander of the 4th Regiment, Colonel Fegan, with the entire regiment participating. Colonel Fegan will be at the head of the procession, serving as the Commander of the Regiment. Admiral Hart and his Chief of Staff, Admiral Connell, will inspect the troops. It is said that this inspection is open to the public and military commanders, officers, and consuls from various countries in Shanghai have been invited to attend. The design of the flag that Admiral Hart will present features a purple-red center with an eagle perched on a circular line, which is slightly similar to the original old flag with a light color as the background. It is scheduled that in the afternoon of that day, a banquet will be held at the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment Club in Duoqiaonong, Jing'an Temple Road, with music and dancing to add to the festivities and celebration. The American community in this city also plans to participate in the commemoration.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Cross-Boundary Road Construction; Opinions Have Not Yet Converged; Authorities Propose that Both Sides Send an Equal Number of Personnel to Jointly Organize an Agency to Maintain Public Order</h3>
<p>Fan Keling, Director-General of the Public Works Department, and Fei Lipu, General Manager and Director, visited the puppet Mayor Fu Xiao'an in the afternoon of the 2nd, and submitted the PWD's proposal on the police power issue of road construction outside the boundary in the western district. At the time, it was said that Fu Xiao'an promised to consider the proposal, and there was a trend towards a sharp turnaround in the future of the negotiations. However, many days have passed since then, and the opinions of both sides</p>
<p>Have Not Yet Converged</p>
<p>Fu Xiao'an has not yet responded to the PWD's proposal, and it seems that the negotiations have stalled again. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency learned the contents of the proposal from diplomatic circles yesterday. It seems that the proposal is more complete in meaning than previous rumors. It is said that the PWD's proposal includes: (1) Both sides will send an equal number of police officers to jointly organize</p>
<p>a responsible agency</p>
<p>to maintain public order in the area of road construction outside the boundary. (2) The police power over the roads constructed outside the boundary and the areas on both sides will be under the jurisdiction of the PWD, while other areas will be jointly managed by both sides. It is also stated that the PWD's intention is not to establish a permanent agreement to resolve the issue of road construction outside the boundary, but only to discuss some temporary applicable measures to stop the friction between the two sides. Once the situation in Shanghai changes, this agreement will become invalid.</p>
<h3>Repayment Draw for National Defense Bonds and Gold Bonds for the First Time; Funds Allocated to Reserve for Payment; Bank of China Ordered to Begin Payment</h3>
<p>In order to raise funds for the war of resistance and to collect gold, foreign currencies, foreign exchange, and foreign securities to fund relief efforts, the National Government issued National Defense Bonds of 500 million yuan, Gold Bonds of 100 million customs gold units, Gold Bonds of 10 million pounds sterling, and Gold Bonds of 50 million U.S. dollars on May 1, 1938. The Ministry of Finance sent letters to various groups and organizations to solicit contributions. The people of the whole country and overseas compatriots supported the government's war of resistance and donated money to the government, and enthusiastically subscribed to the bonds with excellent results.</p>
<p>Winning Numbers for the First Repayment</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance held the first repayment draw for the National Defense Bonds and Gold Bonds at the end of October. The winning numbers are recorded below: (1) Gold Bonds in customs gold units: three bonds, No. 224, No. 576, No. 902; (2) Gold Bonds in pounds sterling: three bonds, No. 073, No. 544, No. 765; (3) Gold Bonds in U.S. dollars: three bonds, No. 105, No. 319, No. 449; (4) National Defense Bonds: four bonds, No. 063, No. 312, No. 480, No. 546.</p>
<p>Repayment of Principal and Interest Begins</p>
<p>The funds for the repayment of principal and interest due on October 31st of this year for the National Defense Bonds and Gold Bonds have been allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank and deposited in the account of the National Debt Fund Management Committee for these two types of public bonds, specifically earmarked for payment. (1) Gold Bonds in customs gold: 300,000 customs gold units for principal and 2.5 million customs gold units for interest; (2) Gold Bonds in pounds sterling: 30,000 pounds sterling for principal and 250,000 pounds sterling for interest; (3) Gold Bonds in U.S. dollars: 150,000 U.S. dollars for principal and 1.25 million U.S. dollars for interest; (4) National Defense Bonds: 2 million yuan in national currency for principal and 15 million yuan in national currency for interest. The above principal and interest to be repaid have been paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted banks since November 1st.</p>
<p>Central Bank Ordered to Comply</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with banking circles yesterday: (1) The National Defense Bonds are guaranteed by the entire income from income tax; (2) The Gold Bonds are designated to be purchased and stored by the Salt Administration in accordance with the regulations for the repayment of principal and interest, with the amounts determined each period. The funds for the National Defense Bonds are managed by the National Debt Management Committee, while the funds for the Gold Bonds are managed by a separate Fund Custody Committee. The collateral for both types of public bonds is reliable, so subscriptions were very enthusiastic. Regarding the repayment of principal and interest, payments have been made by the Central Bank and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, which are entrusted by the Central Bank. However, the three banks in Shanghai, the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications, do not handle this payment business. However, Chinese citizens holding winning bonds and interest coupons can entrust a bank to collect the money from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>The Sunken Japanese Steamer "Shintaigu Maru"; Salvage Work; The Location of the Sinking Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>Three weeks ago, the Japanese-owned steamer "Shintaigu Maru" of the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. (formerly the Nisshin Steamship Company), was sailing from Xingang back to Shanghai. Twelve miles outside the Wusongkou, it was suddenly hit by a "cloudless storm". Due to the excessive weight of the ship and its inability to turn around, it sank, and 340 passengers were killed, as previously reported. It is now learned that the shipping company is attempting to salvage the ship. Three days after the ship sank, it commissioned the Taishan Trading Company to investigate and explore the location of the sunken ship. Another search was conducted last week, and it was determined that the "Shintaigu Maru" is sunk in the mud 50 feet below the water surface at the confluence of the Huangpu and Yangtze Rivers. The company believes that salvage is possible and that it can be salvaged in about a month. It is estimated that the total value of the "Shintaigu Maru," its cargo of cotton, and other goods is approximately one million yuan. It is believed that the cotton in the cabin can still be sold after the ship is raised, because the fiber in the cotton will not decompose and become ineffective until three to four months after being immersed in water.</p>

<h3>Ding Xishan and Others Vow to Serve the Country to the Death</h3>
<p>Ding Xishan and others of the Pudong Loyal and Patriotic National Salvation Army, led their troops in combat in the suburbs of Shanghai, loyal and steadfast. It is learned that Ding's residence was burned down a month ago, and Ding's mother, at the age of seventy, was brutally murdered with knives. No other employees survived. On the day of the family funeral, Ding went in person to mourn, and was almost captured. With national crisis and family hatred, Ding vowed to carry out orders to the death and serve the country.</p>
<h3>Landlord of Mingde Village on Jin Shenfu Road Raises Rent; Tenants Firmly Oppose</h3>
<p>The landlord of Mingde Village on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, the Dafafang Company (i.e., Ma Changji), yesterday commissioned lawyer Wang Hengyi as its representative to notify the tenants that rents would be increased by 30% starting in November. The tenants rose up in opposition and elected Chen Guanghai, Liu Fei Wu, Fang Chaozong, Ni Shenzhong and others as representatives to negotiate with the landlord, expressing their rejection and commissioning lawyer Gu Cangsheng to send a letter to the landlord notifying them of their opposition to the rent increase. It is reported that the landlord cited the prosperity of the village as an important reason for the rent increase. However, the tenants believe that the village is adjacent to the Chinese area (just a short distance from Xiaohama), the area is remote, and few people have ever lived there. Less than one-third of the houses in the whole village can be rented out. However, after August 13th, refugees flocked to the village to rent houses, causing all the houses, alley verandas, and even garages to be rented out to people. The landlord then considers the large number of refugees living there as prosperity, but does not know that those who live there suffer from the pain of rising prices, causing the tenants to rise up in opposition. It is also heard that the tenants' will is extremely firm.</p>
<h3>Landlord Fails to Raise Rent, Beats Tenant</h3>
<p>Zhang Shungao, a 26-year-old Suzhou native and accountant at the Dajiangnan Hotel at 410 Fujian Road in the Public Concession, has lived with his family in the front building of No. 20 Chongde Fang, Minguo Road, outside Xiaobeimen for four or five years. The second landlord is Wang Guochu, a 29-year-old Ningbo native and owner of the Guoguang Knitting Factory. Zhang's rent is 14 yuan per month. Since the war, the second landlord, seeing the abnormal development of the market, has repeatedly demanded rent increases without success, causing resentment between the landlord and tenant, and they often quarrel over trivial matters. At 4:00 PM on the 4th of this month, another quarrel arose over a trivial matter. Wang's mother and sister first surrounded Zhang and slapped him in the face. Then Wang ordered the workers in the factory to twist Zhang and beat him, causing him to be injured and covered in wounds. After breaking free, Zhang first reported to the police station. Yesterday morning, he filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office of the Second Special District Court, requesting a wound examination. At the same time, he filed a criminal self-accusation against the second landlord Wang Guochu in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District, requesting that he be investigated and prosecuted according to law for the crime of injury.</p>
<h3>Secrets Hidden in Suitcase; Opium and Morphine Seized; Two Female Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhao Chenshi, 34 years old, the wife of Zhao Xinmei, a Pudong native living at 140 Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession, was carrying a white large suitcase at about 8:00 AM the day before yesterday and was planning to take a rickshaw to the Bund to return to her hometown across the river. When she arrived at the intersection of Fada Road and Zilai Street, she was stopped by patrolling detectives who were checking pedestrians. They opened the suitcase and found that it had a false bottom. Clothes were placed on top, and hidden underneath were 78 packets of raw opium and 3 packets of white powder morphine, worth more than 1,300 yuan. The person and evidence were taken to the police station. Under interrogation, they went to Room 414 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road and arrested Zhu Yiqing (61 years old, a Pudong native living at 114 Xiamen Road). Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the trial. Lawyer Fei Xizhen of the police station stated the case, saying that the defendants were involved in opium trafficking and requested a postponement of the investigation before further questioning. According to detectives, Zhao Chenshi confessed that her husband had asked Zhu Yiqing in Room 414 of the Dongya Hotel to call a Mr. Tang at Room 526 of the Yangzi Hotel to send the opium to Zhao Chenshi's house. She paid him 300 yuan in advance. Now, in order to conduct a detailed investigation, they requested a postponement. Zhao Chenshi confessed that her husband was in the flower club business and she worked in an egg factory. Her husband asked Zhu Yiqing to call a Mr. Tang at the Yangzi Hotel to send the opium to her house and told her to take it to Pudong. Zhu Yiqing confessed that he was in the rice business and that Zhao Xinmei asked him to make a phone call, but he did not know about the opium trafficking. The court verified the confessions and ordered a postponement of the hearing to the 15th. The defendants were taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Master Yuan Ying Still Detained in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Since Yuan Ying, chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was abducted, there have been various rumors about his whereabouts. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with the Buddhist Association, Yuan Ying is still being detained in Jiangwan, and the rumors of his transfer to Beijing are unreliable. His disciple, Mingyang, is also being detained in a separate room. The reason for the detention seems to have no political motives and is gradually becoming clear. However, Yuan Ying did not hand over the funds raised in Southeast Asia to the Huozhen Wuhui (Fire Prevention Association), so the expenses are very unclear. After the Huozhen Wuhui telegraphed Shanghai for a thorough investigation, they are now conducting a detailed investigation separately.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhanxiong and Prison Guards Accused of Malfeasance and Bribery; Two Fugitive Guards Ordered to Be Wanted</h3>
<p>Chen Zhanxiong, the owner of the Anlegong Hotel dance hall, was arrested for smoking opium and sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. He was sentenced to six months in prison, with three yuan substituted for one day, and the fine was commuted. He was first sent to the detention center and ordered to quit smoking within a month, resulting in the detainees Qin Jiaqi, Tao Yongchang, and Chen Jusheng colluding with the guards Luo Zhiyi, Jiang Nai, and Tu Gang to extort 150 yuan twice, which they divided among themselves. The warden discovered this and reported it to the supervising section, and Chen and the other prisoners and guards were transferred to the prosecutor's office of the Second Special District Court for investigation and prosecution. Jiang and Tu escaped while taking advantage of the situation. After the prosecutor's investigation concluded, he believed that Chen Zhanxiong was also guilty of bribery and ordered him to be released on bail pending further investigation. The others were sent to prison. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. The prosecutor has now filed a public prosecution with the same-level court against the accused for crimes such as malfeasance and bribery. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Minsheng, together with the prosecutor, opened a court session for trial. Chen Zhanxiong claimed to be ill and was represented by lawyer Jiang Pingfan. After the prosecutor stated the reasons for the prosecution, the confessions of Luo Zhiyi, Tao Yongchang, Qin Jiaqi, and Chen Jusheng mutually shifted responsibility. The court ordered a postponement of the hearing, and the defendants were taken into custody. It was found that Tao Yongchang, one of the defendants, had been sentenced to ten years in prison for murder and had just been paroled two weeks ago. He was taken into custody yesterday after the case. Qin Jiaqi was originally a guard who was sentenced to one year and six months in prison for committing forgery. While serving his sentence, he extorted money from Chen, adding crime to crime. The court has now ordered the arrest of the two fugitive guards.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Open Fire, Injuring Refugees</h3>
<p>Zhang Caigao, a 31-year-old Anhui native, was displaced by the war and took refuge in a thatched cottage on the border of the French Concession and the Chinese area. At 3:00 PM yesterday, Zhang was walking alone near the railway line in the border area when he was shot in the abdomen by one of the four Japanese soldiers stationed there. Refugees in the nearby refugee area saw this and reported it to the French police station, who sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

The bullet wounded his left waist. He was immediately taken to the Country Hospital by the fire brigade ambulance. The bullet was removed within half an hour.</p>
<h3>Extravagance Should Be Avoided in Weddings and Funerals; Cherish Materials, Especially During Times of Difficulty; Save on Waste and Cultivate a Habit of Thrift; —Admonitions to All Sectors from the Thrift Association—</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Thrift Movement Committee believes that wealthy families in Shanghai still often engage in extravagant displays for weddings and funerals, even sending out invitations widely and staging elaborate performances. This not only disturbs friends and relatives but also wastes resources. Yesterday, they issued another letter to all sectors, hoping to avoid extravagance.</p>
<p>Advocating Thrift</p>
<p>The original text states: "Upon investigation, people in the upper and middle classes of Shanghai, for weddings and funerals, and even for unnecessary events such as a child's first month or first birthday, a person's 30th birthday, or the death anniversaries of deceased parents, are still issuing invitations on a large scale and staging grand performances. This not only wastes resources but also disturbs friends and relatives. Such extravagance has become a trend, and people continue to follow suit, believing that they are not showing off their wealth enough unless they do so. Since the outbreak of the 'August 13th' War of Resistance, most enlightened people, feeling the urgency of the national crisis, have mostly engaged in thrift for celebrations, weddings, and funerals.</p>
<p>The Trend of Extravagance</p>
<p>began to subside slightly. However, since Shanghai fell into the state of an isolated island, the extravagance has returned and is becoming more intense recently. Business and industrial leaders are again engaging in major extravagance for weddings and funerals, even inviting famous actors and singers to perform grand performances. At this extraordinary time, the government is sparing no effort in promoting the thrift movement. People in leadership positions should set an example, take the lead, and create a thrifty atmosphere in society. Yet they cannot</p>
<p>Understand the Difficulties of the Times</p>
<p>and cherish resources, only showing off their wealth and boasting about their status. It is truly lamentable to speak of this. Our association cannot remain silent in the face of danger, so we dare to sincerely advise and hope that leaders from all sectors will refrain from unnecessary celebrations, and for major events such as weddings and funerals, they must avoid extravagance, earnestly practice the principles of thrift, and save on waste to help those in need. If these gentlemen can take the lead, all will respond, and perhaps the bad habit of extravagance can be eradicated, the thrift movement can be promoted, and the future of the War of Resistance can truly benefit from it. We have spoken frankly, hoping for your clear understanding."</p>

<h3>On Sectarianism</h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>Sects and parties are two absolutely different categories. The former is merely a manifestation of favoritism by a minority, with its feudal traditionalism; the latter is based on the position of the masses, with the so-called true ideology existing.</p>
<p>Sectarianism is most undesirable. It benefits "individualists" but harms the "collective." It hinders unity and even destroys the united front. Whether it is a social group or a production sector, once there is a trace of sectarianism, the entire organization is inevitably ruined. Infighting, monopolization, conservatism, and exclusive control are all their masterpieces. However, do they truly do anything beneficial for everyone? That is not necessarily the case, except for what benefits themselves.</p>
<p>Within the organization of a "party," the concrete and subtle manifestation of sectarianism is engaging in secret cliques. ... Each seeks their own interests, engaging in squeezing, framing, taking credit, expanding the power of "associates," and eliminating the position of others, using every means possible. And the slogan they raise to the general public is: If you want to join, it must be based on "our" principles. From this comes the establishment of secret societies, taking in disciples, with ideology merely a euphemism for who is above and who is below, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Sectarians often borrow the name of the party to connect with emotions they share with others. At the same time, they are very clever and will cite stories as justification: "Godier, wearing a red vest, fought with classical actors in the theater, and Ilyich, who cared for his comrades, laughed and scolded Deborin in his notes. These are not examples of excluding dissidents, but rather have their own positive significance." Their words solemnly point out that their own fortress is actually a new camp, but upon close inspection, their content remains consistent with the old tradition.</p>
<p>And as sectarianism continues to grow, it seems to adopt the actions of the Boxers. They ignore the existence of anything outside their small circle and despise all so-called "outsiders" and "non-orthodox派"! However, their internal contradictions have not been eliminated, and they still fixate on the hierarchy between senior and junior members. This is naturally not surprising, as it is the consistent style of sectarians.</p>
<p>Outside the walls of "guns not allowed," their senses also seem extremely sharp: They can find terms to scold people arbitrarily; others are Ah Q, while they themselves are not ashamed to be Zhao Taiye from Weizhuang. But anyone with common sense clearly understands that Zhao Taiye is an even greater obstacle to history, instigating the local bullies to oppress the likes of Ah Q. Naturally, it cannot be denied that, despite having the status of Zhao Taiye, they dare not ignore the trends of the times and must also oppose feudalism. This allows them to become "experts" or "families" in anti-feudalism, a proprietary position. Even if there are one or two sentences that slightly touch on the sectarian nature of a fellow乡会, they will surely and fiercely slap a terrible label on others. This may be a "misunderstanding," but is it necessary for the literati of this time and place to adopt such an indiscriminate approach? This is still the mischief spawned by sectarianism.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, there was such an incident: In a certain factory, workers had different opinions on international understanding. One group emphasized the contradictions between imperialists, while another believed this was a defeatist view and used their power to expel the other group from the party and the industrial sector. The workers who were expelled were dissatisfied and wrote to the highest authorities to appeal. The authorities pointed out that those who were dissatisfied were correct, and their party membership and jobs were reinstated.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned abuse of power has a hint of sectarianism, which needs to be overcome by everyone.</p>
<p>Whether in politics or literature and art, the slogan of "clearing sectarianism" in the Soviet Union should not be accidental.</p>
<p>The path taken by sectarians is a "blind alley." Hitting a wall will lead to corruption, and surgery is necessary.</p>
<p>At this time and in this place, we must "expand" the clearing of sectarianism!</p>
<h3>Overnight Stay in a Dilapidated Temple</h3>
<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>——War Zone Diary on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway——</p>
<p>Less than three miles from Danyang City, we found a simple village god temple; it wasn't next to a village, which reduces the threat of daytime aircraft. We moved our luggage inside and a gust of evening wind came through, making us feel cold.</p>
<p>Stepping into the village god temple, a musty, damp odor rushed into our brains; it seemed that it had been abandoned for a long time. The window frames were broken and scattered, the front door was damaged, and the statues of the gods were piled high with a thick layer of dust...</p>
<p>After a hasty meal, fatigue entangled everyone. The comrades quickly opened their luggage and lay down on the thin straw. The wind invaded through the window frames, causing each comrade to curl up like a sleeping cat.</p>
<p>"Report!" A stout fist struck the incomplete temple door, emitting an annoying cracking sound, breaking the sweet dreams of every comrade.</p>
<p>On a cold early winter night, it was already difficult to find sweet dreams. Adding this unexpected surprise made us feel even more stunned.</p>
<p>The comrades poked their heads out from under their blankets. The starlight shone into the dilapidated temple. It was midnight, far from dawn!</p>
<p>Comrade × asked the orderly outside the door. He said, "The order is to depart for Shilipai in Jurong at four o'clock, and prepare everything by three thirty. It's already three o'clock now!" After speaking, a light and quick footstep gradually faded away.</p>
<p>As soon as we heard it was a night march, we immediately felt excited. We hurriedly put on our clothes and packed our luggage. The cooks worked even harder, rushing to bury the pot and cook rice.</p>
<p>Before the meal, the division headquarters sent a batch of cotton clothes. The comrades were even happier with this gift than with the meal. Each person chose a number that suited them, took off their unlined clothes, and put on the new clothes.</p>
<p>A wave of warmth made me naturally miss my kind mother in my hometown, and it increased my hatred for the wolves of the future.</p>
<p>It was time to eat, and I remembered that the only remaining candle had been burned out while cooking. So, we had to borrow the faint starlight. We opened the door wider to let more light in; the comrades felt a special interest in this novel way of eating.</p>
<p>The faint starlight could only barely capture the outline of the rice bowl, and we had to rely on our tongues to taste what was in it. The comrades' laughter continued until all the bowls were empty.</p>
<p>After the meal, we packed our luggage, said goodbye to the dilapidated temple, and stepped onto the Danyang-Jurong highway. The night blurred the surroundings of the highway, and the wilderness rested in silence.</p>
<p>The environment further increased our strong interest in rushing on, and each comrade had the thought of "getting most of the journey done before dawn." Our pace quickened a lot.</p>
<p>Sniffing the stimulating fresh cold air, we advanced on the smooth road; the rustling sound broke the silence around us.</p>
<h3>The Ross Institute</h3>
<p>— (M.Ch.16)</p>
<p>Sir Ronald Ross died in the "Ross Hospital" on September 16, 1932. To thank the great scientist for his discoveries relating to the various problems of malaria, the whole world eulogized him. He struggled for malaria his entire life, thus making his name remain in the history of medical science, never to be erased.</p>
<p>Malaria, in ancient history, was also one of the most terrifying diseases. Only at the end of the previous century did mankind have a general understanding of this disease and how it is transmitted. Sir Ronald Ross discovered that the transmission of malaria is affected by a special type of mosquito. This poisonous mosquito is called "Anopheles." It sucks the blood of those suffering from malaria and absorbs the parasites in their blood, and can inject these parasites into the bodies of healthy people.</p>
<p>This invention can be regarded as the most significant of any new invention in the medical field, because after this discovery, the lives of hundreds of millions of people underwent a tremendous transformation. In fact, since then, the problem of malaria has become the problem that people are most determined to research.</p>
<p>The results of the research have yielded many extremely important results, but in any case, the research work is still continuing. The most important organization specializing in dealing with this problem is the Ross Institute in London. The institute relies purely on voluntary donations to maintain itself, but it is able to do its utmost to promote the work of researching malaria, and has already obtained the cooperation of several famous authorities on tropical diseases and the treatment of malaria, such as Watson and others.</p>
<p>Among the most important issues dealt with by the Ross Institute is providing quinine to the people suffering from the scourge of malaria. Later, the short-term quinine treatment method was greatly improved and established. This treatment method is regarded by the League of Nations Malaria Prevention Committee as the most appropriate treatment method, because the treatment period has gradually been reduced to five or seven days. During this period, only fifteen to eighteen grains of quinine need to be taken daily, and no other treatment is needed after recovery. However, if the old illness recurs, it can still be treated with the same method, and it will undoubtedly be cured. For prevention, the League of Nations Malaria Prevention Committee recommends taking six grains of quinine daily during the malaria-prone season, so that there will be no such problem.</p>
<p>The Ross Institute continues to implement the work of its founder in an effective way, without ever stopping.</p>
<h3>Tower</h3>
<p>— Shi Weisi</p>
<p>The setting sun was far behind the mountains, stretching our two shadows long and swaying in the scattered clearings of the forest. Our steps were silent, as slow as an old man. What kind of dreamlike interest was it, facing the evening colors, thinking of things that had never been thought of before.</p>
<p>We stepped over the plank bridge, stepped onto the green path.</p>
<p>My friend is an intuitive lover, a young man recently bewildered by the pleasures of love. The bamboo forest and lake are buried with the shadows of his imagination. This surrounding area must be filled with his thoughts of unrequited love. Facing his entranced pupils, I wanted to tease him, but I struggled to think of a suitable word.</p>
<p>Suddenly, we stopped in one place. Broken tiles and ruined walls, overgrown with weeds, there was a towering tower, with the setting sun leaping on the top of the tower and the ruined walls, forming a special scene. The tower was not very high, but it was already able to look down upon all the ordinary small buildings on the ground. We were familiar with this place. One summer in the past, I lived in a small building very close to this tower. The lonely life made me feel quite bored. Today, I feel that looking at the wilderness under the tower in the evening breeze of June has another good meaning.</p>
<p>My friend, not knowing where he thought of it from, said,</p>
<p>"Do you remember the Tang Dynasty poem: 'The tower's momentum is like surging out, solitary and tall, towering over the great palace'?"</p>
<p>"Exactly this scenery!" I said. But what I thought of was that it was a pity that it was already a ruined tower.</p>
<p>It must have been when I was very, very young, I came out of a mountain village. Now, the small village built on the ridge floats before my eyes again. When I was young, I was a brisk walker, completely different from now. I loved to climb mountains, climb to the top of the tower, and look down on the rising smoke from the village below. What evokes my memory of that small village the most, even now, is that small pagoda. It is said that in my ancestors' time, one day, a flood occupied the entire village and fields. For three days and three nights, suddenly a tower surged up on the earthen mountain. In a burst of thunder, the evil spirit that caused the flood was suppressed under the tower, and the water subsided.</p>
<p>Several times, I wanted to redraw a contour from my imagination for the town-guarding tower of my long-separated mountain village. There should be dozens of believers surrounding it, worshiping and offering incense and prayers, right?</p>
<p>"Two towers, two different destinies!" Yes, you see that the tower in the city is withering and peeling off in loneliness, accompanied by desolate mountains and ruined ruins, letting the traces of wind and rain mark the shadow of constant years!</p>
<p>At this point, my friend suddenly stopped his lofty emotion, and his surprised eyes fell on me. You can imagine his nervous energy, a soul bewitched by the embracing mountains and rivers, as if he had to sing an ancient poem to express his own insignificance!</p>
<p>"You seem to have a meditation. Do you mean there is another tower?"</p>
<p>"Everyone has a tower in their heart," but I thought this was a sorrow. I told my story. "Human interest is built on towers. If you return to my mountain village, you will see that group of devout men and women surrounding the tower, paying homage and worshiping. That tower of faith is actually more magnificent and solid than the tower that surged up from the earthen mountain. They found the joy of life and all the shadows of imagination there! So many things in this society have changed because of this. But one day, the tower of faith collapsed, collapsing terribly. You see, peeling off and desolate, that's how some people's confidence is!"</p>
<p>Silent pupils. I seemed to hear a crisp sound. Whose seven-treasure pagoda made of colored glaze in their heart had collapsed again?</p>
<p>Stepping on the shadow of the new moon, the setting sun disappeared behind the western mountains. Suddenly sad, listening to the distant sound of the washerwoman's mallet, both of us thought of going home at the same time.</p>
<h3>After Talk</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The Language Exhibition is not only an unprecedented initiative, but also an important expression of our country's culture. I hope that those who are concerned about our country's culture will all make an effort to go and see it. The recently published "Literary Renaissance" contains a special feature on the Language Exhibition, written by Chen Wangdao, Xu Jingsong, Ding Fubao and others, which can be used as a reference.</p>
<h3>Song of the Mountain Maple</h3>
<p>— Hui He</p>
<p>The sound of marching hooves shattered the tranquility of the autumn mountains,</p>
<p>The solemn mountain maple trembled with an earthen heart;</p>
<p>Saying goodbye to its old branches in the bleak wind,</p>
<p>Each leaf was trampled into ashes by iron hooves.</p>
<p>The maple leaves on the branches did not show any signs of dejection,</p>
<p>Their crimson faces were more radiant than in the past:</p>
<p>They were dyed with the blood of heroes,</p>
<p>And grew so majestic from the atmosphere of gunpowder.</p>
<p>Accustomed to the clamor of bugle calls,</p>
<p>The glint of swords and shadows of spears mingled in the sunlight;</p>
<p>Knowing that dying in this way is not a waste of life,</p>
<p>Since ancient times, which hero has not staked his head!</p>
<p>The rustling sound startled the autumn wind's high spirits,</p>
<p>The sound of horses' hooves changed from chaotic to quiet;</p>
<p>Faintly, there was the flute music of a shepherdess,</p>
<p>And a solemn smile of victory appeared on the crimson face.</p>

<h3>Shirley Temple Stars in Her First Romance Movie</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Not long ago, a film review contained these words: "In Hollywood, it has become a trend to tailor-make scripts to accommodate an actor's acting skills." This approach can also be said to cater to the audience's psychology. But if this continues for a long time, I think the result will still be that they will be rejected. The content of Shirley Temple's previous films mainly focused on singing and dancing. Although she caused a sensation throughout the silver screen, recently, due to her increasing age, these childish actions have finally been despised by audiences. Hollywood producers have also seen this. In her new film "Susannah of the Mounties," the director added some love scenes in addition to singing and dancing. This is Shirley Temple's first time acting in a romance film! When she performs love scenes, I wonder what she feels in her heart!</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that in the film, there is a scene where Shirley Temple smokes a pipe. Some readers must feel rare to see how she can smoke at such a young age. It turns out that the pipe she uses was specially made by the engineer who arranged the grand fire scene in the final scene of "The Great Chicago Fire." It looks like she is smoking, but the smoke does not enter her mouth at all.</p>
<h3>Two New Dances in Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Recently, two new types of social dances have become popular in Hollywood and New York, and men and women are extremely enthusiastic about them. The famous "Social Dance Teachers College" in Southern California regards these two dance styles as compulsory courses. At the recent "National Dance Association" held in New York, President An Naiyang also announced: American social dance has entered a new stage, with all the old and stale elements gone, and everything has a fresh start.</p>
<p>The so-called two new dances, one named "Polk Orando," is supported by the heel and toe, with the whole body rotating as the main movement. The movements are very slow, the rhythm is even, and the music is sweeter than other dance styles. There are many tricks interspersed in the rotation, which is actually an evolution of combining the strengths of various dance styles. The other is called "Boomps-A-Daisy," which has a relaxed and humorous form, which is to replace the "Rumbas" dance steps that were lively for a while, but the expressions of both parties are even more advanced. When dancing, the male and female dance partners first clap each other's palms, then clap their own knees, and then their bodies rotate endlessly. During the rotation, the man "accidentally" bumps into the other's body, and the woman turns her face back, making a white eye and a surprised look. The music stops abruptly, and the situation is slightly tense. Finally, the man bows his head to apologize, the woman turns her anger into joy, the music resumes, and the two dance partners cooperate again, making free dance styles at will.</p>
<p>The inventors of the Boomps-A-Daisy are the famous dancers Amber and his wife from Texas.</p>
<p>Dolores Del Rio Declares "If you oppress a woman too much, she will explode!"</p>
<h3>Recommending New Play "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty"</h3>
<p>— Ti Gong</p>
<p>At this time and in this place, to actually see something like this, how could one not be both surprised and delighted?</p>
<p>Lying on my pillow, I couldn't fall asleep anymore. A wave of heat rose in my body. When Nen Niang spat out blood from her mouth, the blood all over my body was like a pot of boiling water, and it hadn't calmed down until now.</p>
<p>I love Nen Niang, I love Mei Niang, and I love Ma Jinzi even more, this innocent girl "Ma Jin, who offers gold when mounting a horse, and the son of 儿子"!</p>
<p>Zhou Xinfang has in his mouth "A courtesan does not know the sorrow of national subjugation, still singing 'Backyard Flower' across the river." Nen Niang also has these two lines in her mouth, and even Cai Ruheng shouts these two lines in his mouth, but what is given to the audience are three different responses.</p>
<p>Up to this point, it seems that there has never been a work in Peking Opera that is more meaningful than "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty." However, Mr. Wei Ruhui's new work is undoubtedly at least ten times more powerful than the former.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the distance between Chongzhen and our common people is a little more distant. But we can be Sun Ke Xian, we can be Ge Nen Niang, and at the very least, we can be a Ma Jinzi.</p>
<p>I respectfully extend my highest respect to all the gentlemen and ladies of the Shanghai Drama Society. I recommend this masterpiece, which absolutely cannot be missed, to all the ladies and gentlemen in Shanghai with fervent enthusiasm. I also warmly hope that a few Peking Opera critics will make an exception to see the drama "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty" and, in addition to the sounds, tunes, gestures, and words, discover a little new sprout and bring it back to sow in the garden of Peking Opera.</p>
<h3>Air Raid Theater in London</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European War, although the UK vigorously implemented air defense and dispersed the metropolitan population, most of it did not change much. Among public entertainment activities, only horse racing and champagne competitions were banned, while other football matches, circuses, movies, etc., continued to operate as usual. Most of the modernized theaters in London have air defense facilities. Among them, the famous Golden Blue Circus is arranged very carefully, with male and female receptionists wearing gas masks, and there is also a hospital inside that can provide first aid to viewers at any time. In front of general cinemas, it is also grandly indicated: "Modern equipment, safe and secure, if you don't believe it, come and try it."</p>
<p>The films shown in various theaters mainly focus on being light and avoiding stimulation. However, the heroic situation of the air force is also promoted. The UK's first war film this year, named "The Lion has Wings," stars actor Lee Richardson as the flying general and actress Merle Oberon as the affectionate nurse, highlighting the magnificent spirit of the British Air Force.</p>
<p>The "Prelude to the German-Polish War," a film produced by the propaganda department of the German Nazi Party, is also being screened in London. It was originally a self-bragging film by the German army, but unexpectedly, due to poor propaganda techniques, it instead advertised the brave Poles everywhere.</p>
<p>Since there are various jokes on the screen and safety equipment underground, there is no fear of enemy aircraft coming to attack, so the air raid theater business is very lively. The police department has now stipulated that the opening hours of London theaters can be extended from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm, which is even more convenient for general movie fans.</p>
<h3>The Outer History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The "Jia Diao" of Old Male and Old Female Roles</p>
<p>After this renovation and significant improvements to the stage, there is one thing that is highly praised by the opera circles: among the first batch of new actors, the old female role Li Duokui is particularly outstanding. Not only can she refresh the ears and eyes of opera enthusiasts in Shanghai, but Li's ability to draw audiences accounts for more than one-third of the entire group. This was truly beyond the expectations of those who invited her. Examining the motive, it was because five or six years ago, when Du Junju first went north to invite actors, I (the author) was in Beijing, and I met with Duokui daily. I recommended Li to Du and settled on a package fee of 1,300 yuan with a single word. After coming south, her performance was quite good. This time, Du and the owner of Meihua Hall were again tasked with inviting actors for the renovation. Not knowing the drawing power of Wu Suqiu and others, for the sake of experience, they invited this only inheritor of the Gong school to come along. The package fee was only slightly increased by a few hundred yuan. Unexpectedly, after the opening, Li's popularity was particularly strong. Sometimes, within a single section, every line she sang was well-received, breaking previous records. Firstly, because Duokui's voice is loud and clear, and her pitch is high, even those on the second floor can hear it distinctly. Secondly, because Li never slacks off. In all the plays, wherever the "jia diao" should be used, she always exerts her full strength, emitting a powerful and solid sound from her diaphragm. With a loud shout, the entire audience is startled. The so-called "thunderbolt in clear sky" is truly enough to awaken the deaf and invigorate the spirit.</p>
<p>Note: "Jia diao" is limited to old male roles, martial old male roles, red-faced male roles, and old female roles who use their natural voice. If female roles, young male roles, or painted-face roles who use falsetto or altered voices, they cannot use "jia diao." Furthermore, "jia diao" has soft, hard, and semi-"jia diao" distinctions. At the same time, there are differences in the difficulty of using it in Erhuang and Xipi tunes. (135)</p>
