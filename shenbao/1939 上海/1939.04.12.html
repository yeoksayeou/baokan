<h3>今之動搖抗戰信念者</h3>
<p>今日之中國，非有歧途，容許考量，乃得上下議論，斟酌取舍於或和或戰之間，而曰和戰問題。此其絕對性，舉世無其偶也。國際誠大難，危機一觸即發，終將有毫釐千里之殊，今茲則猶有審擇餘地：若德意志義大利，自喩為騎虎難下則戰，自重而勒馬懸崖則和；若英吉利法蘭西，不復規避責任則戰，更復含垢忍辱則和；若波蘭希臘土爾其羅馬尼亞以次，志切圖存則戰，情甘附庸則和；若美利堅合衆國蘇維埃聯邦，顧及天下後世而伸張正義則戰，但求獨善其身而姑息偏安則和；即如捷克阿爾巴尼亞，遭逢强暴，國祚云亡，自此吞聲飲泣，認賊作父，是果和平，不若是而不共戴天，不顧成敗利鈍，雖無寸鐵，猶與肉搏，是猶戰也。是在或戰或和，可和可戰之間，中國逈異於此。抑兩年之前，委曲求全，埋頭戰備，非不可延長隱忍之時期，展緩抗戰之發動，更不妨標榜之於國門曰和平；然今日之中國，逈異乎此。惟無歧途，故根本上無此所謂和戰問題。有喪心病在者。賣國求榮，諱飾投降之逆謀，幻為主和之烟幕；顧乃天下人耳目不可掩，唾駡誅伐，不稍假借；非惟烟幕不效，更刺激士氣更見昂進。反證國策更見堅定；故主和說雖啾啾之不已，而事實上亦不成為和戰問題。凡此事理，本報旣一再陳述宜為讀者共鑒矣。乃有自香港來者，謂在精衛經營之報紙雜誌，數於本報所論，斷章取義，故作曲解；更誣及中央宣傳部云云，謂背景有自，推其用心，蓋在假借以自重；無聊之甚，不値一笑，然中國之惟有抗戰，別無歧途，此其絕對性，猶應申論</p>
<p>自英國駐日大使克萊琪氏來遊上海，英國駐華大使寇爾氏自滬赴渝，於是英國行將調解中日戰事之說，時有所聞；或旣闢之，而復有旁敲側擊之作。例如昨日某方電訊，謂調解說雖無所據，然英國首相張伯倫氏，方全神貫注於中歐事變，不暇兼顧遠東糾紛，故亟望遠東戰事及早結束云。言外之意，一似中國抗戰，猶應顧及友邦意嚮；又似中國之所期待於友邦者，旣因中歐事變而蒙其影響。如是云云，姑不問其本意之安在，然隱然示人以中國於抗戰之外，猶有問題。有問題者，抗戰非絕對也。又彼蓄意投降者，一面不得不承認要求日本先行撤兵，然後議和，為「用意甚佳」；一面又謂外交手續上無此先例，故主張與日本先行談判，或先行表示接受日本之聲明為談判之基礎。此項主張，無異甘餌，意在引誘中國放棄抗戰，入彼彀中；此在不察者，或因是而以為屈服媾和，自所不甘，然抗戰之外，固別有此一途焉，可以希望日本撒兵。別有一途者，抗戰非絕對也。</p>
<p>夫中國抗戰，對於友邦之有所期待，是屬必然而不必諱之事理；蓋在戰時，期望多所獲益於友邦，此在任何國家皆若是，不獨中國為然。惟期待之性質，絕非依賴；依賴者因人成事，期待者相得益彰；故中國之抗戰，不以期待之結果，為有為無，為多為寡，而為之轉移；易言之，抗戰之繼續與否，惟以抗戰目的之達到與否為標準；權衡在中國，不在其友邦。且友邦之所贊助中國者，乃以中國抗戰而予以贊助，絕非中國因得友邦之贊助而抗戰；因果順序，未可倒置。於是言之，國際情况固不足以動搖中國抗戰之絕對性也。至於中日戰爭，由於片面之侵略行為，非由兩國之外交破裂；故及今而談外交手續，國際先例，根本旣謬，安有是處！要知侵略與自衛，旣為此次中日戰爭之兩種原因，則停止戰爭者，自惟有兩種程式：侵略者不復侵略一也，自衛者不復自衛二也；不復侵略，惟有以撒兵表示之；不復自衛，惟有以屈服結束之。不撒兵，惟有抗戰；務自衛，惟有抗戰。中國抗戰二十一月，日本猶未撒兵，乃謂中國不復自衛而得以外交談判使日本撒兵，謂非欺人之談耶？民心士氣為抗戰之大本，顧所以維繫之者，至為微妙；若乃議和於抗戰之中途，是不但日兵未撤而已，抑且自精神方面先繳抗戰之械也。故今日之事，中國惟有抗戰至日本撤兵為止，中日談判議和，乃在日本撒兵之後，此又絕對之程序，而不容動搖者也。</p>
<h3>兩度遭刦之蒲縣　抗戰空氣緊張　以敵軍卡車零件鑄成大刀鐵工自製手槍射力頗遠大日軍如再犯定遭重大打擊</h3>
<p>山西某地　記者離黑龍關後、由騎兵三名護送、乘騎向晋省西南之蒲縣進發、該地之位置、約在同蒲鐵路與黃河之中間、吾人中途曾在祇有茅屋三橡之小村中稍進熱水、並休憇馬匹、村中僅有住戶一家、正忙於燃火、據云彼等因畏懼日人、全日躲於山洞之中、日人前曾來此盡奪彼等之所有、並將茅屋之門窗悉行燒燬云、吾人旋卽續向蒲縣前進、該地為一雅潔之小城市、位於兩河合流羣山環抱之山谷中、比及行近蒲縣時、則見該城之和平景象、已不復存在、隨處皆有焦黑之殘垣頽壁矣、</p>
<p>吾人由南郊入城、昔日繁華之商業中心、今已荒凉不堪、所有房屋、悉遭焚燬、所剩者祗燼餘之棟樑及搖搖欲傾之殘垣而已、城牆已由華人自行拆毀、俾日軍佔領時、游擊隊得自由入城、使日軍難於固守、城內景象稍好、但所有公共建築、學校、廟宇、以及大部分房屋、則均已被毀、街道中行人甚稀、祇有少數小店及貨攤、照常營業、</p>
<p>記者與所僱之嚮導、住於一半燬之房屋中、聞此屋本為某富室之產業、當時因破壊者倉卒退出、故尙有一部分倖得保留也、旋蒲縣縣長前來歡迎、並以當地情形吿諸吾人、據云、該城平時人口的有二千餘人、今則祇有居民二三十戶、蓋自最近日軍到達黑龍關後、當局曾通令居民撤退、並將所有物携走、目下街市中所見之人民、多為接得日軍前進被阻消息後、始於近日返城者、或為晚間由山中歸來探視其家室者、</p>
<p>該縣長又語記者云、「蒲縣曾兩度被日軍佔領、第一次係在去年三月間、共焚燒城中五分之四之房屋、並殺戮居民六百人、始被華軍逐出、去年底日軍再來時、已無餘屋可資焚燒、居民之被殺亦祇有十六人、蓋共時人民已有組織、知如何對付之方、該處吾人於日軍退出之時、曾在山嶺中加以追擊、頗有斬獲」云、</p>
<p>該縣長又於答復記者所發抵禦方法之問話時、命使者取來大刀及手槍各一並語記者曰、「此大刀係由俘獲日軍卡車之車架零件所鑄造、目下全縣、均備有此種武器、吾人已製有大刀數千柄、及大批農具、以供此間農民之用、日軍第一次前來時、吾人曾於彼等退走之際、迫使將卡車二百餘輛放棄、吾人俘獲之後、卽以大部分發動機供給吾人山中小規模電廠之發電、並將其餘之鋼鐵部分、鑄造武器、與農具」云、縣長又以手槍示記者曰、「此為尋常村中鐵工所製造、完全手工之出品、此輩鐵工均未受製造槍械之訓練、所用鋼鐵原料、皆係取諸日軍之卡車者」云、該槍頗粗劣、外形類似盒子砲、所用者為中國或日本製造之六·五糎步槍彈、有直射之彈道一、及簡單而精巧之發射機、縣長復吿記者謂鐵工得助手兩人、每日能造此種手槍兩枝、所費每枝不及五元、此等手槍乃發給當地保衛團者、僅正規軍始有較精良之軍器、此項手槍、一彈旣射出，卽愼重取出彈壳、而復實彈共中達六次而不能再射發、縣長並示余一人、左手指問夾彈、能開槍與重裝子彈、共迅速幾與使用步槍相埓、記者旋稍懐疑懼、而用此槍放射、覺共挫力頗大、射出步槍彈之力、遠較任何類似之軍器為强、而在其所能射擊之距離內、彈發甚準確、</p>
<p>次晨吾儕策騎赴黃河、蒲縣全城人口、計男婦孩童約一百五十人、均走送吾儕離城、縣長語記者云、彼等因君駕臨、不勝歡忭、自戰起後、異鄕人來此者實自君始、彼等乃感未為外界所遺忘也、</p>
<p>吾儕啟程跋涉入山時、民衆高呼「永遠抗戰」等口號、並竚立目送吾儕至不見而後已、出城途中、經一圍塲、內有日軍卡車的六輛之殘骸、此乃被俘卡車隊之一部分、吾儕之衛兵為本地保衛團團員、陳述三月前發生於此城四週之戰事、渠曾參加此役、並欣然指山坡上之點點墓塚、為述如何每塚中埋有多人之事蹟、又遙指一塚云、內葬士兵十八名、旋復指一草地、共中骷髏白骨成堆、在陽光中泛白色、而稱溝壑下滿積中日軍死屍、盍觀之、日軍因吾人狙擊其輜重隊、給養漸稀、乃不得不放棄環城之羣山、於是吾人進而復佔之、並在山中追擊日軍、且處到埋伏而襲擊之、今日軍又圖三次來犯、彼等或將前來、但吾人熟悉本鄕地理、將乘其不備、而突起製擊、並截斷其交通綫、至彼等被迫再退去而後已、日軍在晋省之所為、已使吾人決心與之作戰到底云、（四月二日路透社特派員發）</p>
<h3>吳敬恒撰文　詰責汪精衛（二）　「二衛」希冀完成傀儡大業擅改公家文件代敵掩飾</h3>
<p>（重慶）（續昨）甲、有人說汪氏此次發表「只舉一個例」、有二個企圖、（一）是我們朋友那天聽汪夫人對同志」訓詞、她說、「我們要達到目的、先要造成能把和戰問題公開討論、至少要使和的問題與戰的問題能同樣讓大家自由討論、現在時候已經到了」因此、汪氏便放第一聲大砲、想引起贊同呀、駁辯呀、鬧得一榻糊塗、企圖搖動人心、破壊抗戰、可使敵人哈哈稱快、但汪氏夫婦、竟敢犯這種賣國大罪、不但人格完全喪盡、且必惹起無邊衆憤、我以為你如此宣傳、除了你的同行王·梁·之類以外、那裏還有中國人來相信你這些賣國降敵的宣傳，被你搖動呢、不過你宣吿你自己人格破產而已、至於對牛彈琴的駁辯、我知道都不願意瘟臭的來淘毛厠、我是叨在座末、應作最後一次的貢獻、在先生我以為你祇相信了敵人而不相信朋友、你以為敵不承認國民政府作對手是眞的、你所以相信敵人只要你在某來作他們講和的對手更眞了、所以你到如今表面上還說是只勸日本與國民政府講和、你可以在野之身從旁協助、這些客氣話、試問你如不通敵、你有什麽資格能說你可以赴敵國與本國政府講和呢、我相信你到如今還是做這個夢沒有醒轉來、還是以為敵人只認你為對手的話是眞直而不是騙你的、所以你還是從容大方很客氣很謙讓的、要勸敵國與國民政府作對手、但是你自己一問你的內容、你胡蘆裏面所賣的究竟是什麽藥哩、老實勿客氣、我來拆穿你的西洋鏡說罷、你這個內容、就是到了相當時候、你就是客氣的出來說、現在國家已經被你們這班不負責任、沒有誠意、毫無見識的奴才弄糟了、你們應該趕緊滾開、讓我來幹罷、一方面你又來裝作悲天憫人的話出來說、「日本旣不要國民政府出來作對手、而國民政府也不好意思來求日本講和、那最後只有我在精衛萬不得已而出來救國、來做日本的對手」、在近衛的所謂「東亞新秩序」之下，「二衛」先生共同的來完成日「滿」支的「協同體」的大業、你們夫妻的計劃豈不是這樣嗎、這我的朋友不是瞎說的、更不是我來開玩笑、你九日聲明對大公報五日所載、你通敵賣國、為黨作倀、引狼入室的消息、還要自辯、不肯承認、但我所得到的村料證據、此大公報所載還要詳確、如果打起官司來、我還要到堂上拿眞憑實據來證明的、到那時你總沒有話可說了罷、</p>
<p>（二）是宣露國防會議的記錄、要使香港等處汪派造一種謠言說、是「汪家二十九日電是與政府是唱雙簧、」有着證據披露、剛使人知道南京會議與汪家二十九日電並無絲毫因果、但見汪氏自己是一個和戰不定、背寒追煖的人物罷了、且以雙簧論、汪氏歪戴小帽、面心裏　着白粉、在台前演手舞脚、近衛在他屁股頭大唱「新秩序、」汪氏的手脚應結合節、不啻若自其口出突然換了蔣先生在他背後痛駁「新秩序、」汪氏就在台前呆若木鷄、手足都僵着不動、這可以呌看雙簧的小弟弟判斷、汪氏與誰演的雙簧、小弟弟必大聲曰、我在吿白看見的呌做「二衛雙簧」中日合演、這是小問題、我勸汪氏大人物不必注意、若犯了洩露秘密文件的大罪、來牽扯成另一趣談、更不値得、</p>
<p>（乙）洩露自身職務地位上所管的秘密文件、已經够犯罪、又把公家文件隨意添改僞造適於己意、不是要想領袖羣衆者所應做、例如在氏文上所引德大使又見王部長、據稱德國駐日大使在柬京曾與日本陸軍外務兩大臣談話、探詢日本是吾想結束現在局勢、並聞日本政府如欲結束現在局勢、是在何種條件之下方能結束、」這是記錄所無、而係代為敵人來掩飾敵人要德國政府來講和的地步、免惹敵國的怨恨、又對於昨日問題、「詳細辦法係技術問題、」記錄亦無、又唐孟瀟·白健生·徐次辰·顧墨三·等談話記錄、亦無之、又陶大使謂「中國抵抗日本至今已表示出抗戰精神、如今已到結束的時機、歐戰時本有幾次好機會可以謀和、但終自信自己力量不肯講和、直至維爾塞條的簽訂時候、任人提出條件、不能不接受×××、在彼看日之條件並不苛刻、」記錄又一字沒有、這是史應該為德國陶大使聲明的、免得陶大使在德國受他政府的譴責、喪失我們中國外交信用、諸如此類之小竄改尙多、雖皆無關宏旨、祇是適於和議之足可歆動、然以中樞要人而能如此自由僞造、即使眞是不小心、利令智昏、去充傀儡、你這樣不能忠於職務、豈不是小鬼見了你皆會怕、所以不敢要你命嗎、你要小心、我想到相當時間、一定會給你一個股汝耕式的下塲、况且現在你夫婦想糾合「同志、」釀成小亂、亦何以管束其部下、無非以僞相市而已、蘇錫文即為其衛兵所圖、伏望在氏保重、（未完）</p>

<p>（巴黎）據外交界方面消息、英國駐義大使潘思、已向墨索里尼提出英法兩國之共同警吿、請其不再更作土地之擴展、如再威脅地中海之現狀、則英法勢將以武力對付、同時昨晚法總理與法外長亦不絕與英相張伯倫·外相哈裏法史斯·在長途電話中通話、關於歐戰發生時、蘇聯能否出而援助巴爾幹各國、法外畏龐萊亦曾與蘇聯駐法大使互相討論、據外交界觀察、義國呑阿之後、若不再有所動作、則英法一時亦不致有强硬對付、惟假使義國得隴望蜀、則時局必將急轉直下、英法目前之努力、在獲得希臘之同意、俾各府島得充英法共同之海軍根據地、英國之意、並不欲將該島作公然之佔領、僅欲以條的形式、作權宜之假用、按在義國征阿比西尼亞時、英義關係極為惡劣之秋、希臘已允該島由英利用今次當然更易得其允許、蓋此决協定一旦成立、則英國即可阻止義國攫取此島、而形成希臘被侵時之援助也、英國之政策、在會同法國與蘇聯巴爾幹各國作密切之合作、以保持亞得里亞海之戰略上的均勢、英法方面現皆感覺、不論羅馬尼亞態度如何、蘇聯與土耳其、必有充分控制黑海與韃靼尼爾海峽之力量、再則希臘雖與羅馬尼亞波蘭同樣不願與蘇聯作軍事上合作、但假若義大利協助保加利亞獲取愛琴海之海口、則對於蘇聯方面之軍事援助、亦必激迎、又據此間觀察，英國警吿義國不得對希臘有何野心之後、義國或將轉而向南斯拉夫謀發展、南國屆時若不加入英之「防禦體系中、則勢將為義所魚肉、（十一日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據今日報吿、英法軍艦現正集中於阿得里亞海之入口處、同時、英國首相張伯倫現正在作最後之努力、擬以外交之方式與議案里尼談判條件、倘意大利能確實保證不進攻希臘、並答應立即開始自西班牙撤退義軍、則義大利佔據阿爾巴尼亞之事實可予承認、政治觀察家以為此種協定如不可能、則張伯倫將於星期四在衆議院中宜佈、謂英政府準備至希臘及土耳其訂立防守同盟並將宣佈廢止維持地中海現狀之英義友好協定、海軍部拒絕發表英艦行動之消息、英法兩國之計劃、顯係為其地中海之利利益而着想者、據聞兩國對於南斯捫夫並不注意、決令之職天由命云、目下德義两國正對南斯拉夫施行壓力、而意大利佔據阿爾巴尼亞之後、已使英法兩國除取道羅馬尼亞之外、無法幫助南斯捫夫、是以英法兩國乃作此決定、另一原因乃由於南斯捫夫未能以解決哥羅地亞民族問題而取得內部之統一、據聞英法現仍與羅馬尼亞談判中、據聞蘇聯對於英國是否眞欲聯合反侵略集團力量、以阻止未來之侵略、仍表懐疑、（十一日美聯電）</p>

<h3>蘇聯重定新政策　倚賴國家主義　—不重協定—</h3>
<p>— 特也</p>
<p>捷克和蘇聯·法蘭西·兩大國曾締結互助協定，自以為有泰山之靠誰知到了臨危的當兒，這兩位盟友，竟袖手旁觀，聽她被人宰割，被人佔領。假使沒有互助協定的話，不必商諸他人，她也許會對敵人作壯烈的抵抗，雖然仍不免於滅亡，還能得一個痛痛快快的下塲。如今呢，旣不能玉碎，復不能瓦全，在不明不白中便「嗚呼哀哉」了。蘇法兩國自然不能辭其咎，而手迭慕尼黑協定者，實為罪之魁。然而當該協定成立之時，竟有許多人稱頌張伯倫挽回浩刼，勞苦功高，道一般利己之徒，只要自己能够保全生命財產，犧牲一個捷克，算得什麼，他們心中怎會有所感痛，吾則早把自命為和事老的百忍公公推倒了。可是天不佑人，造惡者必自食惡果，希特勒野心無饜，得隴望蜀，在併呑捷克之後，又對波蘭·羅馬尼亞·伸出他的饞舌。於是張伯倫也覺得納粹的烈燄，快要燒到自己眉毛上了，生怕波蘭·羅馬尼亞·做了「捷克第二」，捷克第三」，再加上一兩個「捷克第四」，「捷克第五」，保不定英國會成「捷克第六」的，便不再做百忍張公，即大胆地宣布「以後我對德國的侵略，是要反抗了」，一面趕緊以保證給予波蘭·羅馬尼亞·兩國，一面又乘波蘭外長柏克到倫敦的當兒，和他訂成了「英波互助協定」。不錯，張伯倫確已改變他的政策了，然而誰又敢保這個協定將來不會和「法捷協定」「蘇捷協定」「慕尼黑協定」得到同樣的結果呢？於是恭維張伯倫的一般大人先生們，又稱頌「張老先生這番下了大決心，可稱歷史上一個新紀元」。這話發的還過早吧！只看英海相史丹賀浦伯爵演說時說了幾句自負的話，張伯倫便中心慌張，一面請各報不要發表，一面又在下院聲明這話不是對任何國所發的，再加他對於反侵略有力的國家蘇聯，因為波蘭的反對，至今還未邀她加入集體安全制。這很足徵明張伯倫還畏首畏尾，不能貫澈實行他的新政策。現在義國又把阿爾巴尼亞征服了，英國更感到切膚之痛，張伯倫有沒有抵抗侵略的大決心，在後數天內當見分曉。幾個月前，倫敦國民雜誌便說道：「大不列顚決定應吾仍為大國，和為公道自由正義的保護者，仰墮落而為全能國的汽輾　　　　　　，今正其時了」，何况現在呢。然而即在今日，英國對那捷克的遺民，還能自稱為公道自由正義的保護者麽？現在再說到蘇聯，她對於西方民治各國的態度，若即若離，她是民治國中一個强有力者　，英國艾登勞合喬治和工黨，美國史汀生等，都主張「要有力抵抗侵略國，非和蘇聯結合不可」。蘇聯的行動，是今日一　　般人所注意的，英國每日電聞和晨郵報駐莫斯科訪員郤爾頓氏曾有一函，述及蘇聯所受慕尼黑協定的影響，和她因此採行的新政策，茲譯錄如下，想。心歐局者定願意一讀的。</p>
<p>在紅軍產生的第二十一週年紀念日，（二月二十三日）紅軍中上自上將，下至新兵，都須人人宣讀新誓詞，這和列寗時代國際階級戰爭的「紅誓」，大不相同。這次誓詞中不復有「勞働階級的子弟專心竭全力求達解放一切勞工目的，以擁護社會主義」等言，只有「蘇維埃公民願前進保衛祖國」字樣，這和其他任何國防軍的誓詞，大旨相同。蘇聯布爾希維克主義在史丹林嚴密指導下所發傾嚮「國家化」的一切公文，從未像這次登記宣誓所及的普遍。</p>
<p>或謂蘇聯干預西班牙的內戰，大可表示新誓詞的虛僞，其實不然。蘇聯雖曾在一九三七年中指揮西班牙共和軍的空戰，但為時只一兩個月，並且嚴守秘密，（蘇聯報紙從未承認蘇聯曾派一兵一卒至西班牙）再加事已太遲，所援助的，僅以材料·軍事參謀·坦克車·空軍人員·高射砲手，總數不過稍逾一千二百人。</p>
<h3>慕尼黑協定的影響</h3>
<p>無論第三國際以前有何行動，但自西班牙內戰眞正發動以後，蘇聯的政策，是以鼓勵共和軍方面穩健主義的「人民陣綫」抵抗極端主義者為務。共產黨前用破壊策略遏制德國的左翼，因此大有助於希特勒的握掌大權，莫斯科已大大領略了這次所受的辛酸敎訓。這是蘇聯的理想主義有以致之，但蘇聯在西班牙有所行動的決議，大部分是出於取守勢的「權力政治」希圖使法國祖任在西班牙大規模的參戰義務，而强化當時握權的「人民陣綫」政府。她以為法蘇互助協定，必將因此增加力量，蘇聯因為遵行這個協定，才加入國聯的。蘇聯和德國相同，常把捷克放在心坎中，捷克是和法國及現在西歐處於守勢的斯拉夫權力的堡壘相關連的。慕尼黑協定旣把蘇捷協定撕毀，於是法蘇協定也成了具文，因此斷送了一般人所常抱的最後希望：蘇聯在西班牙參戰。</p>
<p>九月間的危機，正在蘇聯從事改造的當兒發生，蘇聯當時頗受窘迫。史丹林的陸軍和內政的淸黨運動原來希望二者最後達到加强「國家化」的目的，於是不得不暫時鬆懈。原來史丹林的本志，至少須犧牲大佐以上的軍官百分之七十五。（未完）</p>

<h3>金融厦門帮力收之下　現金漲落頗平中歐局勢暫趨鬆馳跌度不若假中預測</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、漲落頗平、情勢穩中帶疲、雖目前歐洲局勢暫趨鬆弛、但人心仍感不安、且港滙潛勢鬆賤、加以金號與錢兌業續來吐售、故中途雖有厦鬥帮託某金號一度力吸、但終欲漲無力、結果軋跌二元、交易平平、僅做開六百兩左右、銀樓飾金仍懸原償、中央銀行之海關金等因英純金休業、致無變化、</p>
<p>烚赤暗市小二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開人心稍疲、多方喊二千〇六十八元脫售、而買方須减低三四元方肯吸收，雙方直擯持至九時五十分、因某金號突代厦鬥帮力吸、始有成交、首見某金號進銀樓帮與錢兌業各五十兩、價均法规千〇六十八元、為開盤價、較上週四（卽春假前）晚收未分榮辱、開後某金號相同價又進同業百兩、未幾錢兌業賣予銀樓帮十兩、價六十六元、後某金號又來吸購、進銀樓帮及同業各五十兩、價均六十八元、繼之銀樓帮互做五十兩價則相同、此後錢兌業互做五十兩、為六十六元、後錢兌業又互做五十兩、因成交稍遜、故作價六十二元、近午錢兌業再互做五十兩、六十六元為午收價、午後交易沉寂異常、而價亦鮮少變幻、僅見錢兌業賣予銀樓帮五十兩、價六十六元、後某錢兌業六十六元仍想吐售、但進者還價六十五元、雙方直僵持至四時後仍未做開、故晚收仍為二千〇六十六元、結果較上週四（即春假前）軋跌二元、現金號之本脾全售出價二千〇七十元、收進二千〇六十元、現標金照掛牌全低五十元光景、均無做　、</p>
<p>首飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出因烚赤鮮少變化、故仍懸原價、大同行為二百十元、新同行二百○八元、收進二百〇二元、</p>
<p>關金等亦無變化</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價、仍為一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金仍計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦未更動、計一千二百〇七元六角、乃因英純金復活節休業無電所致云</p>
<h3>港滙獨長　外銀對做美金香港電進英匯</h3>
<p>匯市昨以歐洲形勢、暫趨沉寂、且假期中英美間滙率亦鮮變動、致本市人心仍頗安定、雖中途各大洋行界與天津帮曾來扒結、但以外行如滙豐等供意較佳、故為狀始終少變、致結果仍無榮辱、惟外商銀行略有對做近期美金買賣、而香港來電亦進英塞美、與外行華比套做英美滙兌、合計四元六角八分一厘、全天交易頗旺、至港滙因電訊疲弱、故外行與錢兌業拋塞頗力、獨趨鬆硬、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期長〇六二五、遠期勿動、紐約銀價依然呆定、倫敦生金亦無升降、滙兌英對美·對滬·對法均平、美對英·對滬亦平、對法大七生丁、（以上均照上週四軋過之比較）、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英滙八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、較上週四晚收（即春假前）英美兩滙均未分軒輊、開後雖洋行與天津帮互相扒結、但以外行頗肯供塞、致缺乏變幻、洋行結進匯豐英匯八便士二五、兼有利代天津帮扒結滙豐·華比英滙八便士二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉、港滙獨長七五、其餘均平、白銀平衡稅揭曉較上週四大半分、計徵百分之五·〇○、此後外行與荷蘭互相吃進某行四月份美滙十六元〇六二五、繼之洋行又結進某行美滙十六元〇二五、於是潛勢仍鮮變化、後洋行又吸進荷蘭條滙五十五元七五、繼之錢兌業賣予外行荷蘭與華行廣東港滙（票）五十六元二五、為狀亦穩、午刻外電香港突進英塞美、與外行華比對掉英美滙兌、合四元六角八分一厘、迨午收銀行賣價與晨開無異、</p>
<p>後市洋行續來扒結、滙覧英滙八便士二五、兼又購結華比美滙十六元〇六二五、過程亦頗穩定、入後因聞港滙對外潛勢帶疲、故外行安達拋塞頗力、且洋行納胃不健、故潛勢趨鬆、安達賣予洋行港滙由五十五元七五、步硬至五十六元、迨晚收銀行賣價英滙八便士二五、美滙十六元〇六二五、結果較之春假前、英美兩滙、均未分軒輊、而港滙則軋硬二五、</p>
<h3>日鮮金票　疲落索隱</h3>
<p>昨日英純金與英美滙兌、俱因休假無市、本埠外滙因値開關、洋行結飲甚旺、幸賴銀行及港電、源源供給、市價仍站穩定、較封關前、無分榮辱、烚赤關盤、尙呈穩定、嗣因內地飾金、携滬尙多、頭寸寬裕、金號銀樓業紛紛拋塞、市價一度虛弱、後香港帮錢兌業趁低吸納、頽勢漸戢、下午交易未旺、勢呈盤旋、結果微軟、外幣英美金鎊殷富出籠頗盛、需要稀少、英美金票、外銀行吸納甚盛、日鮮金票供給頗暢、市價則愈趨虛弱、緣日貨輸滬雖旺、日商人間多換取外匯收藏、於彼國家經濟、無甚補助、而彼軍部餉幣之濫發、流散於游擊各區、為數頗鉅、民衆未敢留存、故供給甚殷、公會交易稀少、僅惠通出祥康進香港票五百元、盈豐出鴻昌進香港票五百元、昨日市價、較封關前、英金鎊降一角、英令票降一分、美金鎊降二角、美金票降二厘、香港票升二厘、法郞票降二毫牛、義大利票降二厘、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>香港匯市穩定天津申匯微漲</h3>

<h3>貼現下落</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、漸趨下落、每千元一度又退至四十九元低盤、終則稍回、最後四十九元二角半、較假前（六日）又軋低二角半云、</p>
<h3>美銀無變英印休業</h3>
<p>十日紐約銀市電、美現貨依然呆定、初為四角二分七五、英印銀價因復活節休業無電云、</p>
<h3>證劵　債市堅昂　外股亦好</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、因經過四日之休假、環境消息頗有進出、忽爾謂交易所行將開拍、忽爾又謂絕無其事、忽爾謂英大使赴渝、携有議和條件、忽爾又來闢謠、忽爾又有重慶傳來和平消息、聚訟紛紜、莫裏一是邏輯言之、不外事出有因、查無　據而已、因消息之閃爍不定、時隱時顯、引起投機家之興趣、其他若歐洲風雲、雖已有劍拔弩張之勢、而和平之門並未關閉、惟國內戰爭、數日來頗佔優勢、廣州不難克復、因有人　及南京偽報日人因廣州氣候與彼不合、預備退出、此可見因戰事不利、故作此掩飾語而已、市上受此種種消息之刺激、買氣頓見濃厚、丙種為除中籤、市價尤在休假以前之上、此種形勢、如再稍稍證實、市價前途、必尙有飛黃騰達發見新高價之可能、昨日經過、開盤首先由大　抬價買進、各價即漲起五六角、此後四號七號聯和同裕潤利同康等紛紛買進、其時仁昌順亨德孚順泰以及二十二號均在扳價賣出、更有九號賣出較多、屆收市時、二十號忽有進胃、市價復再堅挺、午前即漲起七八角、午後開盤、二十號再行吸收、大豐及天生均有買進、四十一號亦有開收、聯和永康稍有賣出、五號出丙入甲、市價先堅後平、趨勢頗可良好、綜計市價、結果一致轉漲、計好六角半至八角不等、丙種因除中籤權利故紙漲一角、成交總數的計八十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易，買戶對於交易所票需要最殷、紗布交易所股買方出價三十九元二角半、仍無賣出者、其餘亦無不趨堅、</p>
<p>衆業公所報告、在此數日假期中、遇有種種不佳傳聞、預料開盤市價必致瀉落、但本市反見穩定、如與歐美各股市相比、共中以美市下落更甚、眞不可同日而語、則本埠股票持戶、應懐喜色、各項股份交易雖不大、價格與前低廉甚微、但怡和股及會德豐股經營有良好之成交、公共汽車股因年息祇派七角、致人心失望而劇降至二十五元五角、該息雖少派、但公司一年之盈益甚覺滿意、</p>

<h3>紗花南帮採辦續而不懈　紗市迂迴前進　成交三千七百餘包市價漲五元至八元各廠開出四千餘包</h3>
<p>紗市續趨高翔、氣勢穩靜、蓋以在此封關幾日中、客方銷路仍有八百多包成交、加之港滇汕等帮需要繼續不懈、人心依然振作、市價得此實際交易之推動、乃迂迥前進、但有一部份因廠方額子開出太多、意態較鬆、逢高時復來吐出、中途市情稍帶平定、前途究竟如何、須恃客銷為轉移也、午後市氣尤見緊俏、近日南方採辦紛繁、人心格外興奮、賣價愈昂、雲南帮對於十支粗紗搜羅殷切、故組紗漲風更熾云、</p>
<p>現紗情形、農初開盤、市塲因數日休業後、人頭尤擁、市氣安定且大衆意見、對於市價看好一步、實橡香港潮汕帮皆有辦貨委託、因之氣象緊張、開價較封關前加二元、二十支雙馬為三百八十九元、旋仍以客銷不斷、市態穩固、二十支雙馬紗最高價為三百九十元○五角、迨至收盤以獲利者吐出、略挫一元、午後因生意仍發達、市價再昂、二十支雙馬紗為三百九十二元、再漲一元半、查全日各帮買去統計二千七百〇五包、行情二十支雙馬天女均漲五元至五元半雙地球漲五元、十支粗紗漲三元至八元、廠方由新裕開出十支雙地球五百包、價為三百〇三元、申新廠開出十支童子軍一百包、價為三百○九元至十元、鴻章廠開出十支寳彝二百包、價為三百元、英廠怡和公益楊樹浦等廠開出二十支五福價為三百五十五元、牧羊價為三百五十八元、尙有三二支三星、四二支三星、二十支三星、六支胭脂虎等紗共計四千除包、今日有棉紗十件運厦門、五百二十件運汕頭、五十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>日紗市面在封關之前、大見扶搖直上之勢、多說開關出來要在漲、詎料靑島取引所中之行市、忽然下跌、影響上海市價、於是多方復來出籠、上午步步下落、午後稍回、結果二十支水月價為三百五十五元　，藍鳳價為三百五十元至四十九元、紗價比停市以前之價、下跌一·二元不等、</p>
<h3>貸棉問題尙未發表　美棉價勢將下墜　—火機花又昻半元—</h3>
<p>外棉市價紐約棉市、因歐洲政局之危、紐約證券猛跌、因之棉市被拖下跌、昨日始因華爾街略有購進、而稍回漲、然較之假前尙跌四五磅音、華盛頓方面對於貸款之處置問題、尙無公佈消息、惟據一般預料、日內即將有所發表、其內容雖未能探得、棉價之將墜、可無疑問也、昨日印度棉市較之假前跌二羅比、埃及亦跌二十餘磅音、昨日匯兌較假前無甚軒輊、折合法幣、棉價俱跌、計美棉及巴西棉每擔跌三角、印棉跌七角、埃及跌一元五角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來粗紗交易殊呈活躍、售價高漲、較之細紗允速、各廠因粗紗出數快而多、獲利較之細紗為易、近日各廠均有大批開出、唯紡粗細之原料、如通州姚花地頭售價頗高、運輸不便、姚花已不能運出、故各廠爭購印棉平果爾以替代之、昨日計有榮豐進平果爾一千包、安達進平果爾五百包、茲將昨日期貨價格、折合送廠如下、</p>
<p>本棉生意、依然暗渡如恒各方需要平滯、廠商僅鴻章一家進一百零八件、略為點綴而已、其他絕無生色、日廠態度史岑寂、同行中稍有白包花抵解頭襯交易、但市價隨紗市而昂、通州花較封關前稍漲半元、火機花亦昂幾角、本棉處境仍在艱難中、蘇北通花來源在封關幾天中、到七百二十包、昨日到五百零四包、木架花一百包、（又啟東來六十件、今日有三十件運香港）、茲將現棉成交之額並市盤列左、</p>
<h3>疋頭國布銷路蒸蒸日上　東疋價昻染廠已選用國貨期貨坯布本街定出數萬疋</h3>
<p>國布昨以原料紗綫售盤、上漲甚勁、布疋萬本提高、各廠開盤一致升漲、色布·色斜·每疋漲二角至四角、漂布·漂斜·每疋漲近二一角半、各種秋貨坯布漲勢、尤為劇烈、六·七·八·九月本街總共訂出數萬疋、開價步增、較之週前、每疋又漲二三角、白貨細斜紋·細布每疋漲一角至二角半、本街染廠、以東疋價昂、漸轉移目光、擇尤選用、交易漸轉活潑、成交細布一百餘包、細斜三百餘包、粗布以現銷呆滯、售盤獨無起色、怡和廠輕重磅各檔一律開售原盤、祇十四磅每疋漲五分、新裕十四磅地球以同業手貨缺乏、每疋特喊高四角、九磅內衣粗布每疋漲三角半、內衣廠恒豐廠出品八叫原布每疋漲二角、客銷以遠路西南川滇黔粤帮最為生色、繼續發裝、殊為踴躍、本街需要蒸蒸日上、當令貨及秋貨坯布均旺盛、溫州帮辦粗布四五十包、由溫州輸入浙贛·閩·內地者昨有千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布因春假前連漲過猛、細布·細斜晨市售盤、一致疲軟、北帮亦縮手停辦、市氣鬆懈、每疋回降角許、嗣後因本街染銷尙稱不惡、同業心思堅穩、昨期貨交易續有千件左右、故後市喊盤又復高昂、十二磅彩球細布仍須十三元二角半、惟龍頭比較軟弱、祇售十二元九角、細斜無甚變化、趨勢仍堅、</p>
<p>疋頭十二日出口、十四件運廈門、三百件運汕頭、一百六十件運香港、</p>
<h3>呢羢客銷之一斑</h3>
<p>昨週二、呢絨市面仍堅挺、交易零躉均盛、客銷之中、短中取長、以成都重慶叙府建水嘉定昆明等帮為稍强、北平天津靑島帮亦可、溫州黃巖金華福建諸帮、自南昌陷後、均暫停頓、南京帮購辦尙稱不寂、杭州帮進意較前為弱、蘇州嘉興諸游擊區、祇有零星交易、總之郵件可通之客埠、尙有採辦、所銷之貨、除諸游擊區外、以國產占多數、西貨亦衆、即北平天津二埠、購辦西裝料、亦多西洋貨、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲價步漲</h3>
<p>國內外絲市、開關後均頗堅俏、紐約交易所近期報漲四分、遠期漲三分、昨全日成交額竟達、二九二〇担、堪稱最高紀錄、橫濱絲市、於此春假期中、逐日步升、異常堅穩、昨日現貨則猛漲二十元、遠期漲九元、觀察海外絲市、軋現景象似仍繼續存在也、</p>
<p>邇來本埠絲市、因人心穩定、交易迭出春假前後、在日美絲價轉漲聲中、未見劇烈影響、故得與外銷接近、據絲業中人云、自本埠絲市消長還復正軌後、在春假前後一旬中、上海做開洋莊絲、已近千担、絲價逐漸回升四十元許、深為可喜之現象、昨日本埠絲交、續見開展、白廠八一分二〇—二二條紋、價一六五〇元、七八分二○—二二條紋價一六二〇元、仁記連納等行共進近百担、輯里經六個號十麒麟跑馬等級、國外問訊甚殷、絲交不難更見暢展云、</p>
<p>絲經於十一日運往歐洲一百十八件、茶葉四噸運往馬賽、</p>
<h3>糧食　南洋幫　本粉辦胃甚健　小麥北銷三千包</h3>
<p>廠粉　昨為掃墓節休假後開市之期、本廠現粉交易、似形熱烈、惟實銷則未暢旺、蓋北洋帮以滙水見高、意在抑價而取、廠方則以近日外電報漲、申市洋紛雖充、售價亦難過低、是以扳守原盤、不願再鬆、聞南洋帮去化漸活、成交的有二萬包以上、二號粉廠盤仍為四元四角、本街批價亦同、成交的近萬包、又聞晚市北洋帮曾向廠方接洽整批交易、價擬抑小五分之說但未證實、據客帮消息、天津烟台等處、在假期中已運去十萬包以上、如能價格特廉、進胃尙不示弱、査麵粉出口、今有七萬五千包、運往天津、又一千包、運厦門、</p>
<p>洋粉　日昨洋粉銷路、亦吿活潑、查國外產價尙堅、遠期定貨、依然不劃、新到之貨、近日雖在休假期中、而本客配銷、絡繹不絕、成交已達十餘萬包、其中北洋帮亦辦去不少、及本街零躉去化、市因走銷尙活、貨方不亟亟求脫、故批價堪稱平穩如蝠蝙·雙鷹·燈範·等牌、悉售四元三角匯劃、惟高檔牌子紅日當天售價須四元三角之現鈔、其價格因脾子關係、每有參差也、</p>
<p>小麥　查到貨新有南京江北等處、零星到貨的計四五千包、內由新港來三千包、又聞某洋行手中、亦有數千包運到之說、各廠進胃、依然呆懈、因洋麥合價比本麥為廉、，除定貨絡繹到埠外、又新定澳洲麥一批、計七千五百噸、言定即裝貨、限於本月底以前運到、故廠家對於本麥需要自難熱烈、惟客帮則尙有垂靑，統市由北帮辦去江北南京等麥共三千餘包、價為七元一角三分至七元、市面堪稱堅穩、多日停頓之麥市、在開關之第一天、竟亦打開悶局、</p>
<h3>本街米銷减色</h3>
<p>社米各帮來源、河下共到八號、車輪包子、蘇同帮二千餘包、崑山帮五百包、常州帮二百五十包、大局市面、自隔昨轉懈後、昨則本街銷塲即見减色、而囤戶胃口亦淡、致形勢呈疲、結果厚薄粳市面、除高料貨未見榮辱外、河下及中段貨、隔昨上升較高者、悉已貶小幾分、杜洋尖埠尖、則因貨稀、惰形頗佳、變元供求相埒、無軒輊</p>
<p>客秈昨市客囤兩滯、備有本街揀高略辦、故蕪湖高秈雖開十三元三角半及十三元三角之高價、而市形極軟、中决抑低五六分仍乏受主、全日成交數祗一千多包、倘今明本客去化仍呆、則售價或須步創、良以目下存底充實、來源不絕、市上人心大都下游云、</p>
<p>十二日有苞米四百包運天津產價又飛升七元之多、照現在辦價劃申、當在五十元之譜、尙非特高好貨、進出已呈倒懸矣、二百六十包、汕頭來三百七十包、</p>
<h3>油餅　生豆油高價迭見</h3>
<p>豆油統制問題、依然悶沉、通融之說、一時無辦法、致人心激昂、新高價層出不窮、計開大連油一百六十餘桶、價自四十一元開盤、逐步猛提、結果四十二元五角、比上日市漲起二元八角、烟歧油成交二百件、三十一兀、漲一元八角、大有廠油成父二百担、三十二元七角、漲一元七角、</p>
<p>生油行情、步豆油後塵、節節上騰、新高價頻見、為近年來所罕見、昨計成交膠州油二百七十件、價自三十三元二角至三十四元、比前市漲一元半、四月份成交一百件、三十二元五角、漲半元、靑島桶油三十桶、四十五元、亦較前漲半元、以致門市售價豆油每斤三角七分、生油每斤四角、天秤價</p>
<h3>南北貨　建粬倒懸　產價又升七元</h3>
<p>福建紅粬係以食米為原料、因該處邇來食米頗感缺乏、故製作紅粬者、市貨更稀、產價於是一再上展、昨據福州帮消息、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球業　成立協定</h3>
<p>煤球生意、月前因同業競爭、短兵相接、盤價曾一度猛跌、現經公會方面調解、已成立妥協、計開義泰興南洋正牌、每噸同業送到三十三元、副牌二十九元、加車力一元、各小廠貨色、酌减五角一元不等、門莊發客、每百斤售洋一元八角云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　連豆期貨　略有補空交易現貨行市頻昻</h3>
<p>黃豆現貨交易、未見强盛、惟行情在統制問題籠罩下、頻頻見昂、昨市各豆續升一二角、計本街辦去崇明沙黃五百餘包、價自八元八角開至九角、大連豆由園坊銷去四車、價為九元九元一角、本街成交一車、自出價為八元九角、四月份期豆、因大連通融出口之說、仍無明朗辦法、故有一部份抵空交易、共成交十三四車、價為八元六角八元七角、比上市再漲一角四分、</p>
<p>十一日豆子十一噸半運可倫布、又自啟東來芝麻九十包、</p>
<h3>雜項蛋黃白大宗運英</h3>
<p>蛋黃白為中國大宗出口、自受戰事打擊、出口漸少、本月十一日有蛋黃白六百二十噸、運往倫敦、本埠則有新港運來鮮蛋二千四百二十件、</p>
<p>勘誤　昨閒話魚翅中之全鈎烏鈎兩種、均係東洋貨、誤　西洋貨類、而全鈎誤為金鈎、應為更正、</p>

<h3>被扣各輪已進口　旅客完全釋放　葡領訪三浦提抗議進口各輪仍被監視—航商竭力維持滬溫航綫—</h3>
<p>日艦在浙東洋面扣留葡商輪船後、葡領昨經訪日領提抗議、被扣各輪、昨已進口、泊楊樹浦各浮筒、仍由日方派兵監視、惟旅客已完全釋放、滬溫航行照常、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>被扣各輪駛入吳淞　被扣之各輪船、由日艦監視之下、由浙東洋面駛抵吳淞口外停泊後、葡商正德公司之利寳輪、已於九日午後進口、停泊楊樹浦十八號浮筒、今美商華美公司之棠喬·棠貝、棠魯、葡商美利公司之美達·葡商大西洋公司之海龍。葡商萬國公司之魯德·寳德·均接日海軍通知、於昨日駛人吳淞口、停泊在楊樹浦十六·十七。十八·號浮筒、與九日進口之利寳輸、及以前扣留之希商利物多輪、泊在一處、</p>
<p>旅客釋放載送登岸　各輪雖已駛入吳淞口、停泊楊樹浦浮筒、但每輪上仍由日艦派兵駐守，實行監視各輪之行動、無綫電員、均已失去自由、至於各輪旅客、昨由日艦派拖駁及小汽船、先後將美達·棠貝·棠喬·棠魯·海龍·等各輪旅客以及行李等載送至新關碼頭登岸、惟船員仍留在各船上、貨物亦未准卸下、又魯德·寳德·兩輪、係夾板船以裝貨物為主、故此次駛溫、並無旅客、</p>
<p>日本海軍所持理由　日本海軍當局、於前日招待外籍新聞記者席上、據發言人謂此次扣留懸葡萄牙旗之船隻、現正在調查眞相渠深信所扣各船、其主人翁仍屬中國商人、而外國人則僅取懸旗佣金、且事實上有若干船隻、接濟中國游擊隊、葡總領尙未向領事館提出抗議、惟曾因船隻被扣、來領事館則有之、聞葡領對於日海軍發言人所述、認為毫無根據且與事實不符、</p>
<p>葡領訪三浦提抗議　葡駐滬總領事愛爾夫斯、對日艦扣留該國商輪事件、得航商報吿後、即向日本駐滬領事及海軍當局交涉、連日因春假關係、致未獲結果、昨日因春假期滿、恢復辦公、特於上午十一時赴日本領事館、訪三浦總領事、提出强硬抗議、要求迅予釋放各輪、並提出證據、證實各輪確係葡商所有、聞日方已允先行釋放旅客、並謂已調查各輪國籍、以致仍無圓滿結果、</p>
<p>請求准許僱輪駛定　定海旅滬向鄕會鑒於行駛定甬綫利寳輪、在竹山門被扣沿途滯留、達四日之久、現已被迫來滬、所有旅客均屬同鄕、此次被扣事出意外、以致所帶川費、均己吿罄、擬僱外輪帶回定海原籍、如欲赴定者、希於卽日起、來會接洽登記為荷、又利寳輪船當局、已僱定德商魯麟洋行高登輪、由定來滬裝載被難旅客返定、聞高登輪現泊定海、尙未駛滬、因定海為禁止通航口岸、現正向甬防守司令講求核准、</p>
<p>各輪旅客飽受虛驚　新聲社記者昨晤棠魯輪某旅客，據談、日艦扣留各輪後、曾派日軍登輪檢查、及至今日、始得准許登岸、各輪旅客均已飽受虛驚矣、又此次被扣之各輪、除證實棠貝·棠魯·棠喬·海龍·美達·利寳·及夾板船魯德·寳德·等八艘外、尙有之一夾板船船名、迄未能查明、但據航商消息、為比商輪船、並非行駛滬溫綫者、至於葡商遠東公司之夾板船大茂等、經證實均未被扣</p>
<p>航商竭力維持航行　自葡商輪船被扣後、葡輪美發·棠賽山泰·等均暫緩開航、惟德意各輪則照常開航滬溫綫、（一）德商魯麟洋行飛康輪、准今日結關、明晨由滬駛溫、（二）義商義華洋行寳利輪、定明日由滬駛溫、（三）德商禮和洋行海福輪、定十五日晨由滬駛溫、</p>

<h3>本市各民衆團體封　精神總動員意見　全民族的廣泛動員各界應組國民月會本位工作仍須努力</h3>
<p>自中央頒佈國民精神總動員綱領以來、上海市黨部領導各界、正在積極推進宣傳運動、上海各界精神總動負總會、也已成立了、我們以十二萬分的誠意和熱情、擁護黨部和總會來領導我們、同時我們也在此表示我們對於精神總動員工作的推進的意見、凡我各救亡團體的每一個救亡分子、必須在黨部總會領導之下、將這一運動作為我們工作的中心、使本位工作配合這一中心工作而開展、我們的意見如後、</p>
<p>（一）我們認為抗戰正在轉入一個新的更艱難的階段、蔣委員長早已昭示我們、在這新階段中、政治重於軍事、國民精神總動員綱領的緒論中也明白指出、在這新階段中「所需於吾國國民之淬厲奮鬭以期克服之艱難、較之前期亦日見其擴大、敵人今日已知軍事力量不足以屈服吾人而達其解決之目的、故其最近計劃乃欲以種種方法搖撼吾人之意志、威脅吾人之精神、」我們所謂政治重於軍事、是指工作本身的展開而說、但我們工作的目的、必須是軍事第一、勝利第一、</p>
<p>（二）因此、我們的國民精神總動員、實際上也就是一個全民族的廣泛的政治動員、這裏首先便是一個廣泛的思想的動員、我們為要克服抗戰現階段中的一切艱雖、擊破敵人的詭計、堅持抗戰達到最後勝利起見、必須堅定人民的意志、加强人民對於最後勝利的信心、駁斥一切漢奸親日派的動搖妥協觀念、建立健全正確的思想體系、這也就是總動員綱領中所說的「今日之所宜致力者、尤當注重於精神之振作與集中、」換言之、我們應該根據「國家至上、民挨至上、軍事第一、勝利第一、意志集中、力量集中、」的三大原則、打擊一切叛背國家民族、破壊軍事勝利、動搖意志和分散力量的漢奸思想、發揚三民主義的革命精神、</p>
<p>（三）因為國民精神總動員是針對着敵人漢奸的政治進攻的陰謀而發的、所以敵人漢奸也必然要想盡種種方法來破壊我們的精神總動員、例如他們可以利用「國家至上民族至上和意志集中思想集中」等原則、藉口糾正紛歧錯雜思想、來挑撥民族統一戰綫內部各黨派各階級以至各團體之間的感情、引起互相間的傾軋呑併、但是我們應指出、所謂國家至上、民族至上、正是針對着敵人漢奸的陰謀、正是反對分裂國家民族破壊統一戰綫的陰謀份子、而不能解釋為限制人民團體排斥某一黨派的意義、所謂糾正紛歧錯雜的思想、正是指漢奸妥協派的思想、而不能曲解為束縛人民思想信仰的自由、和取消人民言論出版權的意義、在不違背三民主義的革命精神、和不破壊統一戰綫、不妨害抗戰的大前提下、非但不應該限制、而且應該保障並促進各黨派各階級以及各團體的存在和發展、俾得各以其最善的努力、而貢獻於抗戰、非但不應該取締、而且應該鼓勵各種意見各種學理的互相討論和互相觀摩、以收集思廣益之效、</p>
<p>（四）但是國民精神總動員運動決不僅是一個思想的動員而已、這同時也是一個全民族的廣泛的組織工作、正確的革命的思想、一旦被廣大的羣衆接受之後、便成了一種偉大的力量、但是這力量必待加以組織訓練、才能够予以高度的發揮、給敵人以致命的打擊、這在國民精神總動員綱領中、也明白的指出「欲動員全國國民之精神、以充實抗戰之國力、不僅在於發動、而尤貴於組織、必以有組織之精紳、發揮有組織之人力、利用有組織之物質、方足以適應國家當前之需要、」</p>

<h3>蚊蟲猛於虎</h3>
<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>蚊虫爲害於人，以其能致瘧疾及黃熱病也。世界文化發展之國度，皆最注意及此，設法預防，不遺餘力。吾國前綫抗戰之兵士，多受瘧疾之苦，戰鬥力上發生障碍，此政府及愛國之醫藥專家所　宜矯正補救者。據報吿所載，印度人民每年受蚊蟲之害者的有一萬萬餘人，其政府每年之損失的八百萬鎊，然此不過就政府之稅收言之，其人民本身之經濟損失，猶不在此計算之內。更有令人注意之事，卽暹羅人民在一年之中為虎所食者約五十人，而爲蚊蟲所噬，而死於瘧疾者則有五萬餘人。在政府竭力防範之下，猶且如此，若政府社會不爲注意，一味放任，其爲害之鉅，更可想見矣。</p>
<h3>風的簡單測騐</h3>
<p>— 濟之</p>
<p>風是最不易捉摸的事，俗諺有「捕風捉影」之說，用來譬　虛無縹緲的意思。可是風實在最易爲人類所感覺，並且與人生及一切動植物俱有極密切的關係。風的最大效能，可以說是傳播水汽，簡單的說，便是把海洋面上蒸發的水汽，遷移到陸地上來。其次要算調節氣候，使地面上各處不致過寒或太暖。從生物學一方面說，風很能帮助植物傳種，即所謂風媒的便是。風的奇蹟如此，無怪吾國古時以爲有「風伯」來管理他哩！</p>
<p>其實風的原因，無非是大氣動盪的緣故，大氣爲什麼要動盪呢？那是因太陽輻射的熱，使地面各處溫度不同，壓力差異所致，此外地球的自轉也有相當影響。風有時僅循一個方向吹送，便成水上航行的天然原動力，人類早已利用的了。還可以把他來推動風車，做汲水磨麵等工作，也使人類受到不少實惠。另外一種强烈的旋風，雖不能利用，可是對於建築物的安全，大肆威脅，故工程師一定要知道風的情形，方可從事設計。近來航空事業發達，那嗎不但地面的風，關係重大，便是高空的風，也不可不知道，因爲高空與地面的風是不同的。</p>
<p>風向測騐，普通可分為（一）風向及（二）風速。風向是指風吹來的方向，尋常在城市或村鎭中有固定的目標作爲參攷，很容易看旗幟或炊烟的移動，把他來測定。且不但用東，南，西，北，四個方向，往往可再加東南，西南，東北，西北，用八個方向來辨別得比較準確。不過在曠野地方，不免有些困難，所以最好有一個風向標或特備的旗幟來測騐。但風來的方向，並不是穩定在一直綫上的，所謂某一方向，也不過取其平均狀况而已。</p>
<p>風的大小，完全指風速而言，與風向是沒有關係的。風大便是指風行的速率快，或風施於一面積上的壓力大。風的壓力，大的和風速的平方成正比例，但是也不甚確切。對於建築物的安全問題而言，風壓力的大小，或風速的快慢最爲重要。測騐風壓力比較困難，尋常多從測騐風速着手，然後推算風壓力。測騐風速的儀器極多，目極複雜，恕不能在此備述。</p>
<p>現在介紹一個簡單的風速測騐法，名曰蒲福脫氏之風速測計，列如下表。表中風之大小爲十三級，每級有一個名稱，是中央氣象硏究所參照原文所定的。蒲福脫氏本是一個航海專家，憑他的經騐，把風的大小用陸上所發生的現象來區別，（海上另有標準），於是不用儀器即可確定風的等級。此測騐法已早爲國際所採用，故吾國徐家匯氣象台所發布之天氣報吿中，亦往往見之，惟僅用等級數而不述名稱。表中並將各風級之相當風速（每小時哩數）列入，其他單位可依此推算。</p>
<p>蒲福脫氏風力測計表</p>
<h3>裝氣的電燈泡</h3>
<p>— 心君</p>
<p>自從一八七九年愛迪生發明了炭絲電燈泡之後，許多人繼續努力硏究怎樣改良燈泡裹的絲，要想尋出一種比較耐用些的絲來。結果就尋得了鵭絲。鵭也是一種金屬，和金銀銅鐵一樣，不過人們不大知道，因爲它很和錫相似。美國奇異公司的柯立芝博士發明了煉　的新方法，有人以爲製造燈泡事業已經是登峯造極了。但是還有種種困難問題不能完全解決·譬如用電還有節省的必要，又如燈泡開用之後，就開始變黑，光亮就慢慢减少。因此鵭絲燈泡的確還不能算十分滿意。但是想盡方法，總沒有相當的效果。</p>
<p>奇異公司研究的實騐室裏，許多科學專家費了許多工夫和心思，推求科學原理上的根本方法，並非單從一頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚」上着想，終究在實用上得到了好處。</p>
<p>燈絲的脆性固然可以用煉鵭來解決了。但是燈泡玻璃變黑，非想方法不可。於是就想到燈泡裏的眞空一定有什麽關係。所以就想從改良眞空的製法下手，但是又碰了壁。於是就從兩條路徑進行！一條路是考查燈泡裹氣體的來源，一條路是尋求各種氣體對於燈泡的影響。</p>
<p>硏究的結果證明燈泡裏有了些微水汽，格外使燈泡容易變黑。因爲水汽使鵭氧化，排出成原子狀態的氫氣。氧化鎢到了泡上，又給活動的氫所變，還原成金屬的鵭。氫仍和氧結合成水。這樣的循環不停，就此送了燈泡的終。</p>
<p>最初實騐的人——愛迪生亦在內——都曾想過用各種氣體裝進燈泡裏。但是硏究的結果，裝氣的燈泡總不及當時通行的眞空炭絲泡。後來用實騐證明；鵭絲若是在完全乾燥的泡裏，然到將近要烊（3370　　），同時裝滿了氣，燈絲的壽命比在眞空中要長得多；並且所用的氣越重，金屬的蒸發即鵭化氣越慢。加了氣體可以延畏燈泡的壽命，固然不錯。可是同時熱也損失得多了。</p>
<p>燈泡裏用了密的氣體，像氮氣或是從前沒有使用過的氬氣，在同樣的溫度，减少泡絲的蒸發，抵到從前在眞空中的百分之一·又因爲氣體的交流作用，將氧化鵭帶到燈泡的上部沉下，也不會和燈光有什麽妨碍。</p>
<p>後米用盤絲，就是把鵭絲盤成螺綫形，這樣溫度可以更加高些，因此發光効力亦增加了，所發的光也更淸白了。</p>
<p>上面所述的故事表明從細心的徹底的硏究，才能得到現今通用的燈泡。比較起初的炭絲泡，眞有霄壤之別。誰還願意再用舊式的燈泡呢？</p>
<h3>利用無線電引導工人　開鑿關道</h3>
<p>— 茸人</p>
<p>鑿山通道爲近代建築上艱難的工程。但是爲開闢鐵路，或埋設水管，或建築防禦工事，隧道的需用日繁。凡鑿隧道需自兩端相對穿入，庶幾收事半功倍之效。然自兩端穿入，方向須極準確，吾則不免有差以毫釐，謬以千里之虞。方向的測定，從前全賴測量儀器，測算旣不易，結果自不能十分完滿。現在有一種無綫電定向器，足以引導工人在山中前進，不入歧途，而自兩端同在一直綫上相對前進。鑿山工人祇需循着通過山中的無錢電向前進行，就可以達到目的地。這種方法可以减少不少鑿隧道的困難。美國佛羅稜斯河隧道，通過山嶺起伏的山脈上堅硬的花崗岩，長十三英里，爲世界上最長的隧道。鑿山工人也會利用無線電爲嚮導。自兩端穿入的工人在山中相遇的地點，參差僅千分之三十六英寸。其效用之大蓋可想見。</p>

<h3>限止不遵令賽跑的電器</h3>
<p>— 箴</p>
<p>現在有一種發賽跑令的巧妙電器，足以限止賽跑者恪守槍聲而不搶先開步。這種電綫組織，如圖所示，極簡單。賽跑者在豫備開步時，一手需按着一個墊。各墊由電綫五相串接而通至司令手中的槍，所以他的槍祇能在各個賽跑者的手均按着各人的墊　時，始能發出槍聲。如有一人在發令之前搶先把手提起，電路即中斷，槍聲即不能發。這樣可以劃齊開步時間，而無搶先之弊。</p>
<h3>世界科学消息</h3>
<p>看不見的飛機</p>
<p>英國實用力學雜誌云，該國飛機專家近會試騐一種製飛機的新材料，可用來製成幾乎不可見的飛機。此種材料是透明的，好像玻璃，但比玻璃牢固得多，可用特製的壓機把它範成任何形狀。用此種材料製成的軍用飛樣，在多種光裏都極難看到，允其當它在水的上方飛行，而由它的上方向下看它時，更不容易看到。據說此秘材料和現時所用的任何飛機材料一樣牢固云。</p>

<p>鐵滓可製玻璃</p>
<p>鹹灰是製普通玻璃板或器皿的一種重要原料。但是在印度，鹹灰比較的很昂貴。因此經多决試騐後，現在已發現鋼鐵廠內的鐵滓可以用爲製造普通玻璃器皿的原料。製造時這種鐵滓需用正長岩爲輔佐。據說印度出產的這種普通玻璃，其價格可以减少百分之五十。這種玻璃現已用做瓶，瓦和其它器皿。</p>

<p>菸葉烟的分析</p>
<p>據一位德國食物化學家近來分析菸葉烟的結果，知道菸葉的燃燒發生氣體和蒸汽的混合物。所發出的氣體爲氮，二氧化碳，一氧化碳，和未用過的氧。其他氣體亦有，不過其量甚小。蒸汽即其眞烟，係從燒紅的區域發出。這種蒸汽的生成大都由於菸草中的物質，即樹脂和樹脂狀物，高級碳氫化合物和氮化合物，其最著者爲尼古丁即菸鹼。此項蒸汽在空氣中冷却時，即生成一種膠狀霧，一種有水汽凝結於固體微粒的霧。至溫度達於攝氏三百度以上時，菸葉烟即不能存在，因爲已完全汽化了。冷却之後，霧復發生。</p>
<p>— （英國食物化學，鏡）</p>
<p>可揑的鐵</p>
<p>柏林伏格特博士（Dr.Vans　Aogt）近發明一種極柔順的鐵，可以揑作任何所要的形狀。它的製法，是用鐵粉盛在充滿氫氣的容器裏，在很高的溫度——攝氏一千二百到一千三百度——之下加以處理，便得到此種新奇的鐵，作海棉狀；再用樹指處理一下，可不生銹。這種新材料對於修理水管或油管極爲有用云。</p>

<h3>大學生淪為乞丐</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>這眞是一個驚人的消息，同時也是一個嚴重的問題：在上海，大學生，甚至大學畢業生，竟至淪爲乞丐！</p>
<p>據國際救濟會的消息，該會正在詳細調査他們所以淪爲乞丐的原因，以伸施以感化敎育，授以生產技能。這是好的。在調查的結果沒有發表以前，我們自然不能知道那原因的全貌。但是有幾點，我們却揣測得到。</p>
<p>常然，我們都可以知道，戰事爲最大的原因，也是最直接的原因，以致許多有業者失業，無業者不能得業，弄得窮無所歸，就只好淪爲乞丐，有些大學生或大學畢業生，不能脫出這個網羅，也只好權作伸手將軍了。然而我們再想想看，他們，允其大學生或大學畢業生，究竟可以完全怪着戰事麼？</p>
<p>就以大學生或大學畢業生而論，我們知道，自從抗戰一起，有多少都已趕到內地去，從事實際救國的工作，其中當然不免有本來在上海生活因難的，爲什麽這些淪爲乞丐的，就沒有到內地去呢？</p>
<p>在上海要保持原來的職業，當然是困難的，要找到相當的職業，當然是不容易的，尤其在這抗戰時期，除了消費機關以外，百業都凋敝，而閒置的人才，正可以說得滿坑滿谷。但是我們想想，這樣的知識份子，果然除了做乞丐以外，就沒有別的事可做麼？假使說有氣力的，爲什麼不去拉黃包車或作其他勞工呢？善於說話的，爲什麼不去當跑街或茶房呢？會寫字的，爲什麽不就擺擺測字攤替人寫寫信呢？總之，爲什麽不在乞丐之外作另于些打算呢？乞丐還做得，還有什麼正當的事做不得呢？</p>
<p>我以爲一個人的失業或無業，外來環境的壓迫，固然有相當的關係，而個人內在精神的不振作，實在允關重要。假使說這人有一技之長或者僅有蠻力可以出賣，他却能忠於所事，了無惡習慣，或墮落氣質，我可以說，這人一定不致失業，就是偶而失了業，也一定容易得業，換言之，他的親戚朋友，他的職務上的關係者，一定肯維持他，肯帮他的忙，他決不致淪爲乞丐！</p>
<p>我不敢說，這些大學生或大學畢業生所以淪爲乞丐的原因，都是爲了自作孼；然而我相信，自作孼一定爲他們的最大原因。自作孼，不可活，豈但乞丐而已。</p>
<p>於是，我認爲：授以生產技能是軍要的，施以感化敎育允爲重要！</p>
<h3>在白塔河</h3>
<p>— 童瘦萍</p>
<p>—流動宣傳記略</p>
<p>天空斜塗了幾抹白雲。冬天的太陽，是那麽溫和；）會兒，脆弱的光，也給白雲遮暗了。</p>
<p>風，儘管吹。八九個靑年却早集合在院前預備出發了。各人拿了應用的東西：四技敎育槍，一面白布旗……。短短的行列，在路人矚目下走向預定的目的地——白塔河去。</p>
<p>風吹在我們身上，兩隻耳朶凍得發紅。興奮激昂的歌聲迥蕩在空中。路人，在田裏的佃農，都用驚奇的目光注視着我們。</p>
<p>「到白塔河看戲去，不要錢的。我們開始宣傳了。」</p>
<p>「那我們去，—眞的嗎？」雖是帶了懐疑的態度，然而有些人都不期然的跟蹤着我們，長長的走在後面。</p>
<p>在一陣：「保衛我們的祖國」「擁護我們最高的領袖」的吼聲下，我們的行列，就把這小小的村鎭，繞了一匝。整鎭的人給震動了，許多都走到街上來，他們很興奮緊張，有的竟高肇起拳頭：</p>
<p>「不做亡國奴呀！我們要抗戰到底！」這呼聲與我們打成了一片，四圍的空氣在激動着。</p>
<p>白塔河小學校長陳先生，把我們從街上招待到他校裹來。我們便休息一下，吃了一杯濃熱的茶。</p>
<p>「諸位的熱心，實在使人慚愧而佩服！」謙和的陳校長笑着說：「怕還沒吃飯罷，就在敝處用吧！」</p>
<p>「早吃了。原不該到這裏打擾，可是我們爲了宣傳上的方便，就得請陳校長指敎。」</p>
<p>「不敢，不敢！」他轉臉對一個學生說，「你去關照一下！」</p>
<p>我們，感到安慰地靜默着。</p>
<p>「對不起得很！」陳校長眞太客氣了，這樣誠意招待我們。我們可很慚愧呢。</p>
<p>休息了一下後，重新走出了校。便組成三個小隊，分頭去演說，貼標語及歌詠。同時更吿訴他們：</p>
<p>「今日下午，請你們暫停半天工作，到都天廟來，我們表演有趣的文明戲給你們看。」他們回答着普遍的歡呼。</p>
<p>是下午了，天空仍是很灰暗，風也吹得更緊。剛午飯的時候，都天廟的大天井內早站滿了一堆的人，在他們急切的盼望下，我們决第的登上那專演古戲的「萬年臺」。應用的東西，也一件件由校役代我們拿上。瑛同志一篇激昂的演說之後，由我們自編的「東北同胞」「糊塗蛋」「捉漢奸」等幾個劇本，也就相繼的在同志們通力合作下，夾着歌唱演出。下面觀衆越聚越多了，早忘記了疲乏，一個個咬着牙齒，嚴肅地注視着我們；足足站了四小時。</p>
<p>黑暗的暮影，漸漸襲上了灰白的天空。在他們耍求續演的呼聲下，爲了要趕回我們的根據地，我們就停演了。觀衆才怏怏地，帶了滿足和敵愾的情緒散去。我們也在陳校長的致送下帶了興奮的收穫，冒着北風回來。</p>

<p>（三）</p>
<p>讓天空鑲成紅色，小草飲着鮮血，一幕血戰是結束了。</p>
<p>担心的去看朋友：是飛着一臉紅釆，露出寬大的胸口，大眼睛裏還有未退去的興奮，一些笑容。</p>
<p>拍拍他的光頭，說聲·「如何？」</p>
<p>「妙！一連砍了八個，多鬆爽！」摸摸臂上的傷痕，他笑了。</p>
<h3>防地</h3>
<p>— 廷美</p>
<p>敵人逃了。</p>
<p>在血跡殷然的防綫前，</p>
<p>我們埋下伙伴的遺體，</p>
<p>丟下的槍枝，彈囊，</p>
<p>交給了後來的兄弟。</p>
<p>在這防綫上，烈日下，</p>
<p>我們用袖頭揩過汗水；</p>
<p>風雪一裏發過戰慄；</p>
<p>我們又數過秋夜的星，</p>
<p>看過野花絢爛的大地。</p>
<p>我們一個個以身許國，</p>
<p>深信正義必伸，</p>
<p>强權終須消滅！</p>
<p>那時我們要吹着勝利的號角，</p>
<p>在這埋着伙伴尸骨的防地。</p>
<h3>談餘</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>時常看見來稿中，說到中國人口時，有「四萬萬五千萬」這一個數目。意思是不錯的，但第二個「萬」字是多餘的，寫「四萬五千萬」即可，吾則就成爲「四萬萬萬」再加「五千萬」了。</p>
<p>來稿中也常有「舊瓶裝新酒」這句話，「瓶」是不對的。這話出於聖經，英文爲falsk，原譯爲羊皮袋。因新酒漲力大，舊羊皮袋易致破裂，故不相容。如瓶，牢硬得很，與酒之新舊無關了。</p>
<h3>背歷史</h3>
<p>— 靑侯</p>
<p>我想來背一點歷史，可不知道討人厭不討人厭。</p>
<p>在宋人底筆記裏，常看到金人與元人侵入中國時的暴行，除了「家常便飯」的擄掠婦女，搶刦財物而外，還有對於中國舊文物的蹂躪。據說金人到了曲阜，燒了孔廟，還對着聖像大加詬罵。元人却是不但也燒了幾同行業孔廟，而且還把經書拿去刷馬。——這前一項大槪是出於莊季裕底「鷄肋編」，後一項一時記不起出處，但也是在襟人底筆記裏，而且是用慣概的筆法寫出來的。</p>
<p>不過變化可眞也快得很。金人安住在北中國以後，却又學了中國底老法子，也「　科取士」起來，而那科目，不特有詞賦，還有認爲最主要的經義。雖然一面在推行着女眞文字，但却又趕緊譯了「尙書」，那意思，雖然我們一向的學者看作是中國文化同化夷狄的鐵證，但事實伯在別一方面，那便是：為使居於統治地位的人懂得中國底舊東西，好拿去用作統治中國人的法寶。至於元人有了「朝」以後，那更是大家知道的：孔子也被尊爲「大成至聖文宣王」了，而且特別主璽「儒學」，朱子也忽然紅起來了。用中國底舊東西來征服中國，法子也更加周密，更加厲害</p>
<p>只是我們過去的士大夫也實在値得佩服：看見外族的侵入，是憤慨的；但憤慨舊東西的被蹂躪，却似乎比憤慨大批生命的被屠殺要激昂得多。而侵略者也就終於看出了我們這一點精神，於是當到坐穩了的時候，便特別把我們底舊東西抬了出來。而這僩即刻也就奏效，我們底士大夫不但忘記了從前的憤慨，而且從此便死心塌地做起新主子底乾兒子了。——並且，直到現代，還有人一口咬定成吉斯汗是我們底祖宗。我們對元朝的忠心眞也維持得長久。</p>
<p>滿人入關後，到底對於中國舊文物的蹂躪是怎樣的情形呢？說來也奇怪，記載滿人屠殺的文字是有的，可是記載滿人蹂躪舊文物的文字却像很少。莫非滿人比金人和元人還要文明些嗎？我看決不是的。滿人只有比金人和元人更加聰明，更加明瞭我們底心理。當他們有了「朝」以後，禁書，删書，用了很大的苦心：對於誇耀自己威武的「屠城」的功績有時還讓牠留着一些，而對於特別使我們起反感的蹂躪舊文物的記載却大槪都給「銷燬」了。這倒不是瞎猜出來的，就只是上面說過的「鷄肋編」中關於燒廟駡像的一段，淸朝便給删改過一通。那說的不過是金人，而淸朝還要去删改，可見一面自己也做過那樣的事，一面關於自己這方面的功績一定不呌留一點影子，更是無疑的了。</p>
<p>而淸朝抬出我們底舊東西也更加起勁。孔子被陞得越發高起來，不必說：「八股」成了正宗的文學，也不必說；只看「御纂」或「欽定」的一經書底甚麼「彙纂」義疏」之類，便可以知道那種熱鬧的盛况。這回的功效更大，我們底士大夫眞的就高興得眉飛色舞，忘記了過去無數的「屠城」，忘記了不少的文字獄，滿嘴便「國朝」「國朝」起來。這「國朝」在我們底頭上怎樣作福作威也不要緊的，因爲牠能「稽古右文」。</p>
<p>從歷史上看了下來，我們十大夫的愛復古實在勝於愛民族。—自然，表面上說來，復古還是復民族的「古」，不過一到了實際上，却往往只認得那個「古」而不認得民族。侵略者明白得很，所以那政策總是：就給你們那些「古」罷。他們知道「古」越給得多，你們底腰越彎得下，頭越叩得響。</p>
<p>背歷史自然是乾燥的。我底意思沒有別的，只是說：復古不但不是救亡的武器，而且相反地還是侵略者亡我們的武器。</p>

<p>春秋　中國歷代書畫展覽會特輯</p>
<h3>中國歷代畫展的質量</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>文化愈前進之民族，對於精神上之慰藉，愈感迫切·原始時代，人類智識淺陋，主要需求，爲飲食衣服之供應，直接做其衣食工作之外，羣聚而處，戰鬥爭奪，毫無精神上之感應。迨文化進步，殘忍爭殺，爲不道德之表現，枯燥生活，實有調劑之必要，於是開始其精神之活動：音樂，舞蹈，詩歌，繪畫等一切藝術，皆應運而生，故凡藝術繁榮滋長之民族，即爲文化最早之國家，其理至明，其例至多：在歐西爲希瞰羅馬；在東亞爲我中華民族，文物政敎，蔚成光明燦爛之歷史。而繪畫一端，允具精微之理，藻飾禮制，宏協敎化，表行頌德，鍾鼎尊彝，無不借重於繪畫。至於天龍寳蹟，地獄變相，聖賢圖像，麟閣功臣之作，感人之深，發人猛省，不特爲繪畫之成功，亦民族文化之偉蹟也。且其作風淳厚，講求筆墨，崇尙氣韻，寫生寫意，主神主妙，淡泊和平，實占世界藝術之最上高峰。</p>
<p>繪畫旣具敎化人倫之功，於是歷代帝王，無不盡力提倡，設官分掌，以畫取士，劉（松年）李（唐）馬（遠）夏（珪）精心傑作，往往出之院體，嚴謹渾樸，每與董（源）巨（然）米（芾）郭（熙）江南山水，水墨之筆，異其旨趣。然皆僅供帝王及貴族階級少數人之欣賞，寒酸平民，欲一涉覽而無由，因此繪畫之價値，未能盡量發揮，繪畫之意義，不克普遍昭不，深爲浩嘆！元明以還，南宗盛行，黃（子久）王（叔明）倪（雲林）吳（仲圭），逸筆草草，文（徵明）沈（石田）董（其昌）唐（六如），淡墨楚楚，雖帝王好阿，而民間作風，有如水之就下，隱然出其思想解放之趨勢，以視士大夫之沈湎於八股帖括不知自拔者，繪畫家已居文化之先鋒矣！有淸一代，四王（烟客，圓照，石谷，麓台）。吳（漁山）惲（南田）之流，未嘗無卓然之品。顧自五代兩宋以迄元明淸諸家，名蹟偉本，不知凡幾？或散失於水火，或毀滅於兵戈，千餘年來，已寥若晨星。民國成立，雖就淸室所藏，設爲故宮博物院，陳列展覽，任人參觀，然僅局於一部，限於一地，主其事者，未得盡其能事，多所宜揚，以致効率不宏，成績欠著。</p>
<p>近十年來，繪畫展覽會，幾於無歲無地而無之，要皆一鱗半爪，徵集不廣，陳列不富，甚且魚目混珠，眞贋雜陳，欲求有系統，有價値之繪畫展覽會，渺不可得，有之；惟敎育部全國美術展覽，及倫敦中國藝展上海預展而已！茲者國內各大收藏家，有鑒於此，共同發起中國歷代書畫展覽會於上海，往奢深藏秘笈，不肯輕易示人者，今皆出其所有，公開展覽，以供大衆人士之欣賞，其意義之深，價値之大，不待贅甘。若論其內容，則不遜於前决倫敦藝展上海之預展；論其數量，則駕上海預展而過之。（按上决倫敦藝展中書畫一門僅二百餘幀）但我人置身於古人名作之林，賞心怡情之餘，對於歷代作家，技巧以外，人格之修養，品行之陶鎔，於筆墨之問，求其眞諦，體念此偉大之民族精神，而堅我信念，勗我前途，以効忠我國家民族則可！至於出品之優良，容當另文論述。</p>
<h3>參觀大新公司　中國歷代書畫展覽會後</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>近日書畫展覽會之多，幾如山陰道上，應接不暇，顧欲如此决「中國歷代書畫展覽會」之可觀，除前年故宮書畫運往倫敦陳列，在滬開過一個展覽會外，這里恐怕還是破題兒第一次。</p>
<p>此决書畫展覽會，和普通所開的書畫會，其不同之點有二：（一）普通書畫展覽會，係買賣性質，完全以個人權利爲目的，而此决展覽會，均係非賣品，門券所入，悉交上海醫師公會，作爲醫藥救濟之用，一則係營業性質的展覽，一則係慈善性質的展覽，其意義逈不侔也。（二）普通書畫展覽會，旣以謀利爲目的，故所列書畫，眞僞雜糅，良莠參半，甚則竟無一件可觀者，而此决所列書畫，多係幾位大收藏家，出其寳貴之作品，送會陳列，旣不謀利，必無以贋鼎欺人，願供展覽，定係精品傑作，故其所列書畫，與普通展覽會自不同也。</p>
<p>至此次陳列的書畫，均爲唐宋元明淸，各時代各大家之代表作品，此種作品歷來鑒賞家與收藏家，早有定評，本用不着我畫蛇添足，再來加以讚美，惟自此次各戰區淪陷後，各地收藏家之損失，天然無可限量，古董書畫的數量，旣驟形减少，而古董書畫自必史形名貴，而此决各收藏家，能將歷代書畫，什襲珍藏，不致隳滅，已是難能可貴，今更能以其所什襲珍藏者，陳列展覽，以供世人之欣賞，此更爲難得之偉舉，故世之藝術家與欣賞藝術家，不可交臂失之。且審美觀念，原爲人類所同具，而慈悲爲懷，亦爲人類的同情，則即非鑒賞家，亦有聯袂前往，一飽眼福之必要也。</p>
<p>鄙人對於書畫一道，雖屬門外漢，但亦嘗略窺其一二矣。書且不談，姑以畫論。我國之畫，派別分岐，莫可究詰，有北派，有南派，有儒家之畫，有畫家之畫，有畫院派之畫，有非畫院派之畫。但派別雖多，總不外乎八法，而八法之中，只有二法，惟筆與墨二者而已。譬如算術，名目繁多，千變萬化，其實只有加减乘除，乘即是加，除即是减，結果只有加减二字。近來畫家，又分兩派，一派是西畫，一派是國畫，西畫是寫實主義，國畫是理想主義，其立塲雖各不同，但國書講究筆墨，西書講究綫條，和光綫，綫條是筆，光綫是墨，名目不同，其理則一。故國畫而無西畫之寫實精神，決不得謂之名畫。西畫而無國畫之理想精神，亦不得謂之佳作。</p>
<p>淸初四王吳惲，號稱大家，而吳墨井晚年略採西法，後人不免有微詞。意人郞世寗，以西畫而參國畫之法，卒成大家。近時程瑤笙吳石仙等之畫，亦稍參西法，而人亦多所稱許。蓋國畫有國畫的好處，西畫有西畫的好處，但國畫與西畫，原屬一理，西畫當寫實，國畫何嘗不重寫實，國畫尙理想，西畫何嘗不重理想</p>
<p>余旣非國畫家，亦非西畫家，囚參觀該會所列之書畫，上至唐宋，下至滿淸，多爲各時代各大家之代表傑作，於此看出數千年來國畫沿變之迹，更可於此看出國畫派別雖多，而從沒有不講筆不講墨而可以成名家者，有之是江湖之流亞也·余因參觀此次「中國歷代書畫展覽會」，感想所及，因拉雜書之若此。</p>
<h3>書畫之眞僞與鑑別</h3>
<p>— 潘博山</p>
<p>歷代名人書畫，眞跡無幾，供不應求，而作僞日繁，其高者可以亂眞，即决者亦足以應市，於是眞僞雜出，黎邱之感，藏家不能倖免，嘗覽明孫月峰題沈石田山水冊曰：一此翁贋本最多，然余亦從賞鑑家獲覩一二眞跡、」又題文衡山詩畫卷曰：「昔人謂衡翁書畫，維入其書室，懇其面作，乃得佳，且無僞，今覜此果然。」安世鳳墨林快事跋唐六如落花卷亦云：「伯虎畫，余收可充楝，皆贋作也，維一軸單條及一長卷爲眞。」孫安皆精鑒別，去沈文唐不及百年，其所見所藏所言猶若是。時至今日，距孫安又三百年，而欲尙友古人，求眞品於什百千萬之中，不其難矣。</p>
<p>余藏衡山與錢叔寳書曰：「扇頭四，乞爲點染，一淺設色，餘只須淡著墨，勿署款，三日爲期。」又見王石谷與顧若同書曰：「澹翁長卷，急待賦色，人物屋宇，子鶴已點綴就緒。」沈學子題項貢夫畫梅短歌云：「我聞冬心老在客，一幅一縑索畫直，豈知皆出兄手中，可憐贋鼎無人識。」可知冬心畫梅，大半貢夫代作，今俗眼不察，貴金而賤項，是知古來名家，門下代庖，習爲常事，筆墨流傳，繩以眞僞，誠難言也。</p>
<p>往昔大作家，往往游戲三昧，模倣名筆以欺世，觀夫羲獻名跡，米趙贋作居多，前人已論之詳矣。以米趙之臀法，上擬義獻，千載而下，又豈俗眼所能辨識也哉。</p>
<p>論書畫贋跡有三端，曰：友弟代庖之作；曰：同時偽造之作；曰：後世模倣之作，模倣本最易辨，同時僞造者較難別，若代庖之作，則所擬筆墨必相似，所用印鑑必相同，苟非硏討有素，焉能目謀神會耶？</p>
<p>然則書畫眞僞，將何以辨別之？曰：縑素之質理，墨華之沈浮，當以科學方法究其極；時代有變遷，筆墨有遞嬗，當以學術眼光得其眞；然此又不足以盡鑑別之能事也。書畫蓋與詩文同理，所以抒寫人之性靈，性靈寄托於筆墨，筆墨所至，性靈存焉，人之品性各異，故其所作書畫亦隨筆性而異趣，雖一點一拂之微，父子師友，不能貌似，求其旨要，旣非空言可喩，又無物理可證，博覽深思，神而明之，庶於書畫眞贋之別，百無一失矣。</p>
<p>晋唐眞跡，遐哉遨矣。兩宋名筆，大都藏歸內府，外間稀如星鳳，往昔不過從後人模倣本及傳紀所載者，想像意會，得其大槪而憶。淸社旣屋，天府改易，故宮珍秘，頻得出展，於是兩宋以還，名翰寳繪，廬山眞面，始得流露人間，而藝林遂具眞認識，鑑別亦有新發展矣。</p>
<p>晚近珂羅版術發明，公私收藏，相率影行流傳，其製版精者，僅下眞跡一等，雖縑素墨彩，未能盡傳，然古人用筆大意，足資硏討，豈非收藏家之大幸事乎？</p>
<p>近日收藏家，一變往昔秘玩陋習，紛紛出展所藏，以供同好評定，好古敏求之士，旣有眞跡比較，復得印本參考，則凡縑素墨彩，與夫古人之筆性筆趣，皆有綫索可尋，心領神會，眞贋不難立辨矣。</p>

<h3>歷代畫展之元人畫</h3>
<p>— 徐邦達</p>
<p>繪事莫興於唐，莫盛於宋，莫大於元。唐尙質，宋尙文，理趣猶有未盡，至元人繼起，一洗唐宋刻畫之跡，遺其糟粕，擷其精英，於是意象超玄，技進乎道，而天地造化不宣之秘，假毫楮而闡發靡遺矣。自明淸以降，雖俊才輩出，然述而不作，終嫌屋下架屋耳。今之譚聲偶者曰，詩被前人做完，繪事豈不亦云然乎。欲尋藝壇牛耳，自必以元賢爲歸。試以歷代書畫展覽會中諸元人筆論之，如趙氏父子（子昂孟頫·仲穆雍）之蘭竹，黃子久（公望）之九峯雪霽；王叔明（蒙）之冬靑茅屋，林麓幽居；倪雲林（瓚）之綠水園；馬文璧（琬）之莫雲詩意；方方壺（從義）之溪橋幽興；郭天錫（畀）之雲山；王孤雲（振鵬）張叔厚（渥）之白描揭鉢圖·九謌圖諸作，皆雄·毅·闊·大，淵·雅·渾·穆，雄毅者，浩邁無前，精猛遒勁，闊大者，瞪目九天，游心萬古，淵雅者，脫略俗陋，渾穆者，斂盡鋒芒，凡此諸公，兼茲數美，中亦略有偏長，趙松雪父子，郭天錫，馬文璧，王孤雲，張叔厚，耽於淵雅渾穆者也：黃子久，王叔明，方方壺，近於雄毅闊大者也；若倪高士一槎片石，短竹蕭疏，看似澹逸一種，然細味其雄闊處，覺黃王數子亦當遜讓一步，其堪拜倒也。夷考諸公行狀，或縉紳大夫，或畸士高賢，皆能讀萬卷書，行萬里路，當其拈題卽景，伸紙揮毫，胸有成竹，目無全牛，所謂筆所未到氣已吞，故能神全意足，機趣恣橫，豈俗工陋匠，描頭畫角者，可得而擬議之哉！故曰：自元人出而畫道成，自元人出而畫道盡，自元入出而後生晚學，無能跳其掌握矣。余生而幸後元人數百載，得快覽其遺圖妙蹟，又生而不幸後元人數百載，終爲共牛馬走，而低首下心，莫能自振於繪苑之座末也，爲元人畫說。</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>全上海電影界　應參加義賣運動</h3>
<p>— 海翼</p>
<p>—這裏貢獻幾條具縣的意見</p>
<p>聽說國際紅十字會發起，在最近這幾天當中，舉行一個擴大的義賣運動，牠所包含的界限很廣，即是無論那一種事業，把一天營業或一部份收入，在這一天統統獻給義賣運動，如若道一個運動眞能够普遍地打開去的話，那麼，這個義賣運動，一定會獲得極好的效果的。</p>
<p>至於所有收入的經費，則已規定完全撥作救濟難民。躱在後方像上海這樣地方的人士，在義賣運動上，如使能够多盡一點力，這也是應該的。</p>
<p>除了工商界，學生，新聞界都將集體參加這種義賣運動以外，我們對上海電影界，也懐着同樣的熱望。</p>
<p>我想稍稍關心祖國戰事及各地難胞的中國電影從業員及電影製片商，戲院老闆們，你們一定比什麽人都會更熱心地參加這個運動的。</p>
<p>我以為電影界參加這次義賣運動，應該分三方面去做：</p>
<p>第一，是以電影從業員個人的身份參加的，在這裏，每一個男女電影從業員，由演員，導演，到攝影師，佈景師，都應參加這個運動。它的辦法，我以為可以假定有如下數項：（一）男女明星導演的簽名簿，如附有照片的簽名簿則更佳，用最快的時間，使全公司的男女演員導演等都簽上名字，然後規定價格，每一本簽名簿賣多少錢，（二）男女明星親筆簽名的照片，而且隨時可以題上款；（即買照片人的名字）（三）女明星的刺繡，手工，如手帕，枕套；（四）男女演員，導演，佈景師，攝影師的藝術作品，如圖畫，彫塑，佈景模型，攝影師以電影手法替人拍照等等。以上海影迷那麽多，爲了救濟難胞，買的人一定踴躍的</p>
<p>第二，是以公司團體的身份參加的，希望電影界在義賣運動這一天能全體參加平劇，話劇，及各種游藝，明星們平日在做壽，做喜事，尙且參加演劇，在義賣運動這天，更是義不容辭的。同時全體男女演員，能發賣一種電影界義賣運動紀念章，買這徽章的，由男女明星親自爲購買的人佩帶，（或附送鮮花一朶）一定使主顧們踴躍選購的。</p>
<p>第三，是電影製片商及戲院老闆們，必須合作起來，把這一天戲院所有收入，統統捐給義賣運動，片商和戲院老闆規定大家不拆賬，比如滬光的「木蘭從軍」，新光的「影城記」，金城的「武則天」等，及大光明等四大影院，都必須參加這一個義賣運動，集全上海的大小中國影商的戲院，這一筆收入到也是相常可觀的。</p>
<p>以上面所想到的幾點，如使都能够實行，那麽我想在電影界本身，總算也替國家民族盡了一分力量；而難胞們如使能藉此得到一點敎育及學習生產技能的機會，這也楚電影界同人所思賜的。</p>
<p>我們希望這一個運動馬上就能展開，因為時間很侷促，全上海的幾家電影公司熱心電影從業員，應馬上發動起來，並且立刻就勸手實行。</p>
<p>至於美商中國聯合影片公司從業員，他們每個都是中國人，他們愛國的熱忱，常然不會後人，那麼，他們參加這决義賣運動，也當然是應礙的工作。</p>
<p>我們等待着這個運動的展開，同時輿論界，一定也肯盡最大的努力，來促成，宣傳這一個運動的！</p>

<p>— 西蒂</p>
<p>馬連良　趕排新劇</p>
<p>馬連良現在在北平的新新戲院出演，其他角色，尙有張君秋，蕭長華，李多奎等，曾絡續排演「靑風亭」，「蘇武牧羊」，「絨花計」，「釣金龜」，生意相當地興隆。最近馬又延請吳幻蓀爲其編新劇「十老安劉」。按吳本爲國內著名之編劇家，與馬之情感，素甚敦篤，此决趕編是劇，賣力之至。據云，內容別具風味，戲中有十個老生互相戲謔，實開平劇界未有之例。關於角色的分配，的確是個問題，因劇中十個鬚生，事實上均須以硬裹子擔任，馬本打算教聘葉盛蘭，馬富祿，劉連榮等分任角色，但葉馬劉三人，現都出演於上海黃金大戲院，故目前已變更計劃，決定的姜妙香，蕭長華，袁世海等加入。全劇所用服裝，都有考據，並非馬馬虎虎。至臉譜一層，已特請專家翁藕虹繪製，且馬本人自昇平署內，亦得有二幀極珍貴者。據我友壬君所得之消息，該劇演時，其最末一塲，十個鬚生，同時登塲，趣味無窮，實爲空前所未有者。</p>
<p>尙小雲　新收徒弟</p>
<p>尙小雲的風頭還是像過去那個樣兄，現率領尙長春，尙富霞，王鳳卿，范寳亭，宋遇春等，出演於北平中和，長安二戲院。戲碼有「蕩寇誌」，「九陽鐘」，「開山府」，「摩登伽女」，「蘭陵女兒等。中和演夜戲，長安演日戲。上月有某名琴師之介紹，收坤伶李慧君爲徒。正式拜師禮，在尙宅舉行，是晚並設宴招待各界，極一時之盛。</p>
<p>言菊朋　嗓音恢復</p>
<p>舊譚派中的頂兒尖兒著名鬚生言菊朋，過去曾因嗓音低弱，每爲一般人嘆爲美中不足，最近已完全恢復嗓音，對譚腔可充分發揚。廢曆新正，在大連露演，賣座始終不衰。後又赴哈爾濱應聘當地之華樂大戲院，逐决排演「捉放曹」，「擊鼓駡曹」，「上天台」，「洪羊洞」等譚派拿手好戲，生意之盛，打破哈埠從來所未有之紀錄。本年五月內，或將來滬一行。</p>
<p>譚富英　羅致靑衣</p>

<h3>公餘雅集平劇綵排速寫</h3>
<p>— 票偵</p>
<p>四行儲蓄會祖織之公餘雅集平劇研究社近以淸明假期於八·九·二日特借古柏公寓禮堂舉行，第三决綵排。名票如胡仲文，樊弢夫，龐秉俠，徐季芳，孫敏侯諸君均有精彩演出茲將觀後所得草誌於後</p>
<p>筆者於昨晚八時許至古柏公寓，一進門但見人頭擠擠已覺有向隅之感了。這個禮堂容量是相當的寬大，一半作爲戲臺，一半排列着座位，佈置堂皇，甚是難得。其時臺上已演第二齣上天臺，觀姚期扮相魁偉，嗓音嘹曉，很是稱職。第三齣虹霓關由潘景梅君飾丫環，再配上孫敏侯君的王伯黨，和虞倩秋的東方氏，頗有牡丹綠葉之妙；潘君扮相極美，略肯梅博士，嗓音淸越，一段二六歌來，抑揚頓挫，甚爲悅耳；（筆者按此君若能力求深造則前途未可限量）虞君做工純熟，扮相亦美，惜眼風太妖豔，不免過火，爲識者所譏。據說潘虞二君還是初决登臺，有此成續，良匪易易，至孫敏侯君的王伯黨，他是票界之葉盛蘭，唱做老到，博得臺下彩聲不少。第四齣是朱××小姐的六月雪，扮相甚美，惜嗓音低狹爲憾。壓軸爲珠簾寨，樊弢夫君飾李克用，的是名票身份，一段與程敬思的對唱快板，眞是佳構，洵屬珠連璧合，臺下彩聲常起。朱伯平君的程敬思，嗓音亮而逸，聞此君曾得名伶言菊朋指授，恐不誣也。孫敏君的大太保和徐季芳君的二皇娘，精彩百出，使該劇生色不少，筆者因時已深晚，不待終塲即返，未窺全豹固覺可惜耳。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一四三）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>李狀元殿試時有怪風相助</p>
<p>日前因爲「十三妹二齣戲，說到年羹堯的座師李蟠身上；要講起李狀元的家世來，的確與佛家所說的因果二字很有關係。李蟠的祖父李向陽先生，學問道德，都是爲也人所推崇的，明熹宗（天啟）在位時，閱人魏忠賢專權，各地皆爲其建生祠，聲勢煊赫，朝廷大權，完全操之魏閹。那時向陽先生的文名已爲舉世所共曉，不過他因目擊時艱，知國運已阨，故而隱居鄕里，不願出仕。魏忠賢因慕先生文才，曾三决招其入都，並誘之曰：「祗要先生北來，今科狀元必屬之於君」。向陽先生三次皆峻拒之。由此就可知他的人格是如何的高尙了。後來明室已亡，他又密的萬年少。閻古古諸明末遺臣圖謀恢復明室；無如大勢已去，非少數人所可挽叵，所以他老先生也就與萬。閻等一同婦隱了。</p>
<p>向陽先生的公子李弇，也是一位飽學之士，在家無事就敎他兒子李蟠攻讀詩書。康熙時海內澄平，滿奴爲繭絡人心起見，很想選拔明代忠臣的後裔，在朝爲官，冀圖减少排滿復明的勢力；因此李蟠遂特別被他們垂靑，欽點爲頭名狀元。</p>
<p>據徐州父老中，看過李蟠家書的人講起，他當日的高中，實在是太也僥倖了。李蟠身體肥碩，殿試時，別人均已完卷，他仍獨自跪在那裏繕寫，愈着急，愈寫不出來，霎時急得熱汗直流，神志昏迷，卷子上究是寫了些什麽言詞，連他自己也弄不淸楚。不想正在這時，忽然起了一陣怪風，刮得天昏地暗；要在從前殿試的慣例，旣然過了相當的時間，仍未完卷，那就要收了卷子，驅他下殿的。不知康熙帝與李家有甚麼緣分，不但不收他的試卷，反而傳旨點起紅燭，並於殿下設一圍幕，命李於幕內將試卷繕畢後，再行撤去，像這種優遇士子的奇聞，恐怕是古今很不多見的吧。</p>

<h3>Continuous Victories in Counteroffensive on Guangzhou: Gan Chinese Army Approaching Nanchang Suburbs; Shilong Recovered, Confirming Japanese Army's Retreat Northward along Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway; Japanese Army Lands at Nantou, Advancing Towards Shenzhen; Chinese Aircraft Bomb Japanese Barracks in Huangpu, Setting Fires after Being Hit</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign News. The Chinese army is counterattacking Guangzhou and achieving continuous victories. According to those who escaped from Guangzhou to Shiqi, they witnessed a continuous stream of wounded Japanese soldiers being transported back to Yueyuan [Guangzhou] for treatment. It is also reported that the counterattacking forces of the 12th Army Group have crossed Jiangcun, only ten miles from Guangzhou, with the second target being Shijing. This place is a key point in the outer defenses of northern Guangdong, with a considerable number of Japanese troops stationed there. The Chinese army may once again seize Shengang first in the northeast corner, heading directly to Guangzhou, making it difficult for the Japanese army to take care of everything. The recovery of Shilong by the Chinese army is confirmed, and the Japanese army has retreated northward along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. (Special dispatch, 8 PM on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shenzhen News. 1,400 Japanese soldiers landed this morning at Nantou, one mile outside the Hong Kong border, and are advancing towards Shenzhen. The situation on the Leizhou Peninsula is becoming tense due to the impact of the war in Siyi [the four counties of Taishan, Xinhui, Kaiping, and Enping], and the Japanese are continuously increasing their troops in Qiongyai [Hainan Island], seemingly planning to attack Xuwen and Beihai. (Special dispatch, 8 PM on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong Air Force authorities dispatched multiple reconnaissance aircraft this morning around 3 AM to conduct aerial reconnaissance and protect Hong Kong's airspace. (Special dispatch, morning of the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing dispatch. The overall war situation stabilized on the 11th. The Chinese army in the Gan [Jiangxi] territory continued to attack Nanchang. The battle situation in Gao'an intensified. The Chinese army in Gaoyou City continued to hold firm. The strongholds near Dacheng were all under Chinese control, and the Japanese army's invasion of Xiushui made no progress. (Special dispatch, morning of the 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here, Chinese troops achieved a great victory on the front line in Jiangxi Province yesterday. They are counterattacking Nanchang along the eastern part of Gan [Jiangxi] Province and have approached the suburbs of Nanchang. The Japanese army is retreating towards Nanchang. The Chinese army is now stationed west of the Gan River, along the Gao'an-Fengxin line, which was recovered the day before, and is 55 kilometers from Nanchang. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is heard that the Japanese army has landed at Daxin Street (transliteration) on the coast of Shen Wan [Deep Bay], four miles north of British territorial waters, and then entered Nantou Town. It is reported that several places in the town are on fire. The Japanese army is now advancing towards the Shenzhen border. It is widely believed that the Japanese army wants to clear the Chinese irregular forces in the border area, so they are active near Shen Wan again. It is also said that the Japanese army had previously threatened to set fire to Nantou if the villagers of Nantou did not cooperate with them. The landing of the Japanese army at this place this time is probably to carry out their intimidation. Some timid people believe that Shenzhen is currently a place without military installations, and if the Japanese army occupies it now, the Hong Kong border will become more troublesome. However, those in charge do not think so. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Informed sources here say that several Chinese armies have indeed been ordered to counterattack for strategic reasons. However, the claim of a general offensive by the entire Chinese front is still not mature. At the same time, the Chinese side now anticipates that the Japanese army will make every effort to attack in order to completely occupy the Yuehan [Guangzhou-Hankou] Railway. The main Japanese force will jointly attack Changsha from the Hubei and Jiangxi provinces to occupy the northern section of the Yuehan Road, and then advance towards southern Guangdong. It is reported that the situation on the West River is tense because the Japanese army in Sanshui has advanced rapidly via a roundabout route, hoping to encircle Wuzhou. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is reported that after the Japanese army successfully landed in two places in South China this morning, Nantou has become a living hell. At 7 AM this morning, 1,400 Japanese soldiers landed at Dachong. The Japanese army that landed in the northern part of Nantou advanced towards Shen Wan, which is connected to Hong Kong territory. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, a squadron of Chinese aircraft flew to Huangpu yesterday to bomb. Japanese warehouses and barracks were hit and caught fire. (Express News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Changde. After being defeated by the Chinese army, the Japanese army in the Gao'an area retreated to Sanlao Creek, about thirty miles from Gao'an. Chinese reinforcements are now advancing towards Nanchang and Fengxin in two directions. (Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Changde. In the past two days, the Chinese army advanced to a certain place dozens of miles north of Xiushui, and □xia is approaching the county seat of Wu'ning. (Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan. On the morning of the 11th, Chinese and Japanese forces engaged in fierce fighting in the Xinjie area, which continued until noon. (Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Sihui. A telephone dispatch from Xinchang reports that the Chinese army on the southern route of the West River once recovered Jiangmen on the 7th, killing many enemies. However, the Japanese army then sent reinforcements from Japanese warships along the river. Due to the disparity in numbers and to avoid being cut off by the Japanese army, the Chinese army voluntarily withdrew from Jiangmen and moved to nearby □□ highlands to hold firm. In addition, the remnants of the Japanese troops surrounded near Xinhui City have recently received reinforcements and are苟延殘喘 [barely surviving], but the Chinese army is still closely monitoring the highlands north of Xinhui City and continuing to mop up. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Sihui. After the battle for Baisha Bridge (near Guanyao) began, the Japanese army's position gradually became chaotic due to repeated assaults by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army urgently transferred hundreds of people from Zhushan to reinforce them. The Chinese army is still confronting them in the Wengang and Baifengang areas. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan. After the Chinese army captured Xinjie, the Japanese army has actively sent reinforcements from the east and west for counterattacks for several days. At noon on the 9th, the Japanese army on the railway front used multiple tanks to cover a large force to invade, and used aircraft to bomb fiercely to assist in the battle. The Chinese army bravely resisted. The two sides advanced and retreated repeatedly. In the evening, a part of the Japanese army outflanked the northeast of the Chinese army, and at the same time used dense artillery fire to strike fiercely. The Chinese fortifications were completely destroyed, so they voluntarily turned to the口方 [unclear word] to advance. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received here, the battle situation in Jiangmen and Huicheng is still fierce, but neither side has made any significant progress. Multiple Japanese aircraft flew to Siyi yesterday to bomb fiercely, with Danshuikou suffering the most. Currently, Chinese reinforcements are arriving at the front line one after another. It is expected that there will be a major battle in the Kaiping and Xinning areas soon. (Express News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, after the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi recovered Liantang on the 9th, they took advantage of the victory and advanced northward. Yesterday, they had advanced to the vicinity of Luojia City and cut off the retreat route of the Japanese army invading Jinxian. The Japanese army on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Highway, after reinforcements arrived yesterday, launched a counterattack on Gao'an again, and is now fighting fiercely with the Chinese army between Gao'an and Dacheng. Chinese mobile teams are now continuing to attack Fengxin and Jing'an to threaten the flanks of the Japanese army on the Hunan-Jiangxi Road. (Express News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to news received here, the Japanese army in Wu'ning continued to attack the Chinese army's positions in the Futianqiao and Yangang areas in the western suburbs of Wu'ning yesterday. The Chinese army bravely resisted, and the battle situation was very fierce. In addition, a Japanese army unit is now advancing forward from the Futianqiao area, attempting to outflank the Chinese army in Jianfu. In the Gao'an area, the Japanese side admits that they encountered strong resistance from the Chinese army and have made no progress so far. In the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road, the two sides are still fighting fiercely on the banks of the Fu River. The Japanese side claims that the Japanese army has occupied Hujia Town, a key point in the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road, but neutral parties have not yet been able to confirm this. (Express News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Battles around Ruicheng: Chinese Army Wins; Two Japanese Aircraft Shot Down</p>
<p>Xingji. In the battles of Ruicheng, Monan, and Dagou South, the Chinese and Japanese armies fought fiercely for four days and nights. A total of over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed and over 300 were wounded. Two Japanese aircraft were shot down, and 11 twin-barreled light machine guns and heavy machine guns, multiple rifles, over 20 mules and horses, and countless military supplies and documents were captured. (Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Xingji. Cai Chuishan's unit, the main force of the puppet Imperial Army Fan Shengwu, revolted and surrendered to a certain security commander of China. This move dealt a major blow to the Japanese army in southern Fen. (Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese military field dispatches, the Chinese army in southern Shanxi launched a full-line offensive against the Japanese army yesterday, but failed. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Rapid Progress of Chinese Army in Hubei</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to front-line reports received here, the Chinese army in Hubei Province has made rapid progress since the start of the counteroffensive. It has completed a semi-circular front line encircling Hankou from the north, southwest, and south. The front line is gradually being strengthened from Yingshan in the north, Zhongxiang Jiukou in the west, and Yuejiakou in the south. Several small towns that were originally in the hands of the Japanese army have now been recovered by the Chinese army one after another. It is reported that the Japanese military strength in Hubei Province is very weak, and most of the troops have been recently transferred to Nanchang. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army in southwestern Shanxi Province launched another attack on the Chinese army in the Zhongtiao Mountains a week ago, attempting to defeat the main force of the Chinese army there and then prepare to cross the river. However, this attempt has been defeated by the Chinese army. There are now no traces of the Japanese army in the Ruicheng and Pinglu areas. (Express News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Observations by Foreign Military Experts: Japan's Adventurous Actions Against China Will Enter a Critical Juncture; Japan Relies Entirely on Motorized Equipment, and Hand-to-Hand Combat Is Far from a Match for the Chinese; If China Can Launch a Counteroffensive, It Will Not Be Difficult to Break the Japanese Advantage</h3>
<p>(New York) Regarding the situation of the Sino-Japanese War, the New York Minsheng Tanbao (Republican faction) recently published an editorial commenting that the Japanese army's offensive in Hunan Province has apparently been frustrated. If the Chinese army launches a counteroffensive on multiple fronts, it can defeat the various lines and points occupied by the Japanese army in China. According to foreign military observers, if the Japanese army concentrates its motorized equipment to cover the advance of its infantry, it can achieve its goals. Conversely, if the Japanese army's artillery and aircraft cannot exert their powerful firepower and there are no large tanks to lead the way, then its infantry cannot effectively advance. The Japanese military authorities have already gained painful experience and deeply know that if the Japanese army engages in hand-to-hand combat with the Chinese army, then this Chinese army, whether composed of coolies or students, is no match for the Japanese army. Based on this, if the Chinese army launches a counteroffensive on more than a dozen fronts, the advantage of the Japanese army's motorized equipment will inevitably be broken by the Chinese army. Coupled with the guerrilla warfare disrupting the Japanese army's transportation lines, the Japanese dream of extracting wealth from China will inevitably be extinguished. In short, Japan's adventurous actions against China will enter a critical juncture within a few weeks, which can be asserted. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Total Casualties of Japanese Army in Northwest Theater: Over 117,000</h3>

<h3>Ma Xiangbo Sends Letter of Thanks for Birthday Wishes, Wishing to Save Expenses to Aid Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Ma Xiangbo sent a letter from Liangshan to Yu Youren and others thanking them for their birthday wishes. The original letter reads: "Youren Bingsan brother, greetings to the gentlemen of the celebration committee, I am grateful and ashamed for the honor bestowed upon me on my humble birthday. Thinking of the officers and soldiers on the front lines, fighting fiercely and laboring diligently for the country, how can I bear to waste useful wealth on useless deeds? If you gentlemen are mindful of the old man's intention, contribute to the battlefield, rescue the wounded soldiers, encourage the morale of those who kill the enemy, and achieve the full success of nation-building, so that the old man can witness the resurgence of the country and the world can ascend to the realm of longevity together, then the old man's hundred years of life will not have been in vain. I respectfully thank the gentlemen for their kindness and express my humble intentions, hoping you will understand and not announce them. Respectfully yours, Ma Xiangbo, a centenarian."

<h3>Chinese Army Platoon Leader Zhou Mingyi: Runs Out of Ammunition, Seriously Wounded, Heroically Sacrifices Himself; His Loyalty and Courage Are Worthy of Praise</h3>
<p>Tongguan. Chinese Army Platoon Leader Zhou Mingyi, on the 20th of last month, led 30 soldiers to reconnoiter from Fenyang through the Lianjiashan Bottom. They discovered that over 1,000 Japanese soldiers were heading from the northwest to Fenyang. The platoon leader immediately led his team to ambush the Japanese army at the back of the Majiashan Bottom, letting the Japanese vanguard pass. When their main force approached, they used light machine guns and rifles to fiercely strafe the dense ranks of the Japanese army. The Japanese vanguard heard the sound and turned back, surrounding and attacking the platoon. The platoon was divided into three mountains, forming a mutually supporting position. Although the Japanese army was numerous and their guns and artillery fire was dense, it was ultimately difficult to approach. From dawn to dusk, the platoon leader calmly commanded and fought bravely, disregarding his own safety, fighting fiercely for 17 hours. The ammunition ran out and they were heavily besieged. The platoon leader was seriously wounded, but he still held the only remaining hand grenade in his hand. When dozens of Japanese soldiers were at the closest distance, the platoon leader pulled the pin of the hand grenade, perishing together with the Japanese army, making a heroic sacrifice. Five soldiers also died heroically, and over 20 soldiers broke through the encirclement. In this battle, over 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. The platoon leader fought against the many with the few and did not retreat until death. His spirit of loyalty, courage, righteousness, and valor is truly worthy of praise by the soldiers and civilians of the entire country. It is heard that the government will give generous rewards and condolences. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Spymaster Against China, Doihara Disfavored in Tokyo; All Plans Fail, Kita Has Replaced Him</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Lieutenant General Doihara has long been known as the Lawrence of Arabia because his conspiracies in China are comparable to those of Lawrence in Arabia. It is heard that although Doihara is currently still working in North China, he has fallen out of favor in Tokyo because all his plans to resolve the Sino-Japanese War have failed. Clear evidence of his disfavor in Tokyo can be seen in the appointment of Kita as the head of the liaison office of the North China Xingya Yuan [Asia Development Board]. Kita and Doihara have always had incompatible policies towards China. Now that Kita has been selected to assume the important liaison role in North China, it shows that Doihara has lost the support of senior military officials and the Japanese government in Tokyo. Another reason why Doihara is not trusted by Tokyo is said to be that he is disliked by the politicians of North China. The Japanese are now trying hard to win people's hearts, so they have appointed Kita, who has a better relationship with the politicians of North China, to carry out the liaison work. Furthermore, Doihara once launched a campaign to win over Wu Peifu, and then planned Wang Jingwei's humiliating peace, hoping that most Chinese leaders would respond to it. Unexpectedly, the results were all failures. Although the Japanese side is still planning other plans, they are no longer willing to rely on Doihara. In the past ten years, almost every Japanese conspiracy in China has had Doihara's behind-the-scenes participation. The September 18th Incident was launched by Doihara, Itagaki, and Ishihara. Subsequently, the several actions by Japan to control North China were also mostly presided over by him. Since the outbreak of the current war, Doihara has also exerted his special talents, and the recent insistence on inviting Wu Peifu to come out of retirement was one of his plans. At that time, there was a conflict with Kita, and when his plan failed, Doihara's influence was replaced by Kita. Kita's work in China is also not a one-day affair. After the Shanghai War of January 28th, Kita personally participated in the January 28th Incident. Later, he went to "Manchukuo" to work, and then served as the director of the China Department of the General Staff Headquarters. In 1936, he went to Beiping as the military attache of the Japanese Embassy in China. The establishment of the North China "Provisional Government" was mostly planned by Kita. There are currently four liaison offices set up by the Japanese in China. In addition to the one in North China, there is one in Inner Mongolia, one in Central China, and one in Xiamen.

<h3>Wang Jingwei Seems to Be in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Informed sources here do not believe the claim that Mr. Jingwei has arrived in Guangzhou, but believe that the news that Wang has arrived in Hong Kong may be more reliable. According to the Shishi Xinbao [China Times], Wang's followers Zhou Fohai, Chu Minyi, etc., have established a secret agency in Shanghai to transmit information to Wang and prepare for Wang's arrival in Shanghai.

<h3>The Person Assassinated in Tianjin Was Cheng Xiwei</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News. Cheng Xiwei, the manager of the puppet United Reserve Bank of Tianjin and concurrently the puppet Tianjin Customs Superintendent, was assassinated at the Dagguangming Theater in the British Concession on the evening of the 9th. He was shot in a vital area and died on the spot. Cheng and his wife were watching a talkie movie. When a heated scene was playing, a brave man fired a shot, but the audience and police officers did not notice it. The assassin left calmly after the incident. Cheng was 47 years old, from Jiangsu, and was a returned student. His wife was the youngest daughter of Gao Erhu. He recently succeeded Wen Shizhen as the puppet Tianjin Customs Superintendent. After Cheng's death, Wang Kemin made a speech in Ping [Beiping], expressing a sense of "the rabbit dying, the fox grieving". (Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Those Who Shake the Faith in Resistance Today</h3>
<p>Today's China does not have alternative paths for consideration. It is absolutely unique that the entire nation is debating and deliberating between peace and war and calling it the "peace or war" question. International affairs are indeed difficult, with crises on the verge of eruption. Minute differences will ultimately lead to vast disparities. However, there is still room for assessment. If Germany and Italy feel they are riding a tiger and cannot dismount, they will wage war. If they value themselves and pull back from the precipice, they will seek peace. If England and France no longer evade responsibility, they will wage war. If they endure humiliation and swallow insults, they will seek peace. If Poland, Greece, Turkey, Romania, and others are determined to survive, they will wage war. If they are willing to become vassals, they will seek peace. Even if the Czech Republic and Albania face violence and their nations perish, should they swallow their voices and recognize the enemy as their father, that is peace. Or should they refuse to live under the same sky as the enemy, disregarding success, failure, profit, and loss, and engage in hand-to-hand combat even without a single piece of iron, that is war. Thus, in the choice between peace and war, China is vastly different. Two years ago, compromising and burying oneself in war preparations was not impossible to prolong the period of concealment and delay the outbreak of resistance. It was even possible to proclaim "peace" at the nation's gates. However, today's China is vastly different. Because there is no alternative path, there is fundamentally no such thing as a "peace or war" question. There are those who are unscrupulous and diseased. They sell out the country for personal glory, disguising their treacherous plans of surrender as a smokescreen of advocating peace. However, the eyes and ears of the world cannot be covered. They are spat upon, reviled, and condemned without the slightest hesitation. Not only is the smokescreen ineffective, but it further stimulates morale and demonstrates greater advancement. It reaffirms the national policy and demonstrates greater determination. Therefore, although the advocacy of peace continues incessantly, it does not, in fact, become a peace or war question. The newspaper has repeatedly stated these principles and hopes that readers will understand them together. However, those who come from Hong Kong claim that in the newspapers and magazines run by Jingwei, they quote out of context and misinterpret the newspaper's arguments. They even falsely accuse the Central Propaganda Department, claiming that it has a background and that its intention is to gain importance by pretense. This is extremely boring and not worth laughing at. However, the absolute nature of China having only resistance and no alternative paths should be further elaborated.</p>
<p>Since British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, visited Shanghai, and British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, went to Chongqing from Shanghai, rumors about Britain mediating the Sino-Japanese War have been heard from time to time. Some have already refuted this, while others are making oblique hints. For example, a certain news dispatch yesterday stated that although there is no basis for mediation, British Prime Minister Chamberlain is focusing all his attention on the Central European incident and has no time to attend to the Far Eastern disputes. Therefore, he urgently hopes that the Far Eastern war will end as soon as possible. The implication is that China's resistance should still take into account the intentions of friendly nations, and that what China expects from friendly nations has been affected by the Central European incident. As such, regardless of the original intention, it subtly suggests to people that China still has a question besides resistance. If there is a question, then resistance is not absolute. Also, those who are plotting to surrender inevitably have to admit that the demand for Japan to withdraw its troops first before negotiating peace is "well-intentioned." However, they also say that there is no such precedent in diplomatic procedures. Therefore, they advocate negotiating with Japan first, or first expressing acceptance of Japan's statement as the basis for negotiations. This proposal is nothing more than a poisoned bait, intended to entice China to abandon resistance and fall into their trap. Those who are unaware may, because of this, think that surrendering and making peace are unacceptable, but that there is indeed another path besides resistance, which can hope to make Japan withdraw its troops. If there is another path, then resistance is not absolute.</p>
<p>China's expectations from friendly nations are indeed inevitable and should not be concealed. In wartime, expecting to gain more benefits from friendly nations is the case for any country, not just China. However, the nature of expectation is absolutely not reliance. Reliance means that things are accomplished by others, while expectation means that things are mutually beneficial. Therefore, China's resistance does not depend on the outcome of expectations, whether there are many or few, to change course. In other words, whether resistance continues or not depends solely on whether the goals of resistance are achieved. The decision rests with China, not its friendly nations. Moreover, friendly nations are supporting China because of China's resistance, and not China resisting because it has the support of friendly nations. The order of cause and effect cannot be reversed. Therefore, international circumstances are not enough to shake the absolute nature of China's resistance. As for the Sino-Japanese War, it is due to a unilateral act of aggression, not a breakdown of diplomacy between the two countries. Therefore, to talk about diplomatic procedures and international precedents now is fundamentally wrong. How can there be any such thing? It should be known that aggression and self-defense are the two reasons for this Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, those who want to stop the war must have only two options: first, the aggressor no longer commits aggression; second, the defender no longer defends. To no longer commit aggression requires withdrawing troops. To no longer defend requires surrendering. If the troops are not withdrawn, there is only resistance. To defend, there is only resistance. China has been resisting for twenty-one months, and Japan has not yet withdrawn its troops. Therefore, to say that China can get Japan to withdraw its troops through diplomatic negotiations without defending itself is nothing but a deception. The morale of the people is the foundation of resistance, and the way to maintain it is extremely subtle. To discuss peace in the midst of resistance is not only because the Japanese troops have not withdrawn, but also because the weapons of resistance are being surrendered first in the spiritual aspect. Therefore, the only thing China can do today is to resist until Japan withdraws its troops. The negotiations and peace talks between China and Japan will take place after Japan withdraws its troops. This is another absolute procedure that cannot be shaken.</p>
<h3>The Twice-Robbed Pu County - Tense Atmosphere of Resistance - Large Broadswords Forged from Enemy Truck Parts, Locally Made Pistols with Long Range - Heavy Blows Will Surely Be Inflicted If the Japanese Invade Again</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Shanxi - After leaving Heilongguan, our reporter, escorted by three cavalrymen, rode towards Pu County in southwestern Shanxi Province. This location is roughly situated between the Tongpu Railway and the Yellow River. En route, we briefly stopped for hot water and to rest our horses in a small village consisting of only three thatched huts. Only one family lived in the village and they were busy making a fire. They said that they feared the Japanese and hid in mountain caves all day. The Japanese had previously come and taken everything they owned, and burned all the doors and windows of their thatched huts, they said. We then continued on to Pu County, a neat little city nestled in a mountain valley where two rivers converge, surrounded by mountains. As we approached Pu County, the peaceful scene of the city had vanished, and charred ruins and crumbling walls were everywhere.</p>
<p>We entered the city from the southern outskirts. The once prosperous commercial center was now desolate and uninhabitable. All the houses had been burned down, leaving only the charred remains of beams and pillars and crumbling walls about to collapse. The city walls had been demolished by the Chinese themselves, so that when the Japanese occupied the city, the guerrillas could freely enter the city, making it difficult for the Japanese to hold. The scene inside the city was slightly better, but all the public buildings, schools, temples, and most of the houses had been destroyed. There were very few pedestrians in the streets, with only a few small shops and stalls operating as usual.</p>
<p>The reporter and the guide he hired stayed in a half-destroyed house. We heard that this house was originally the property of a wealthy family, but because the destroyers withdrew in a hurry at that time, a part of it was fortunately preserved. Soon, the magistrate of Pu County came to welcome us and told us about the local situation. He said that the city usually had a population of more than two thousand people, but now there are only twenty or thirty households. Since the recent arrival of the Japanese army at Heilongguan, the authorities had ordered the residents to evacuate and take all their belongings with them. Most of the people seen in the streets at the moment were those who had returned to the city in recent days after receiving news that the Japanese advance had been blocked, or who had returned from the mountains in the evening to visit their families.</p>
<p>The magistrate also told the reporter, "Pu County has been occupied by the Japanese army twice. The first time was in March of last year, when they burned four-fifths of the houses in the city and killed 600 residents, before being driven out by the Chinese army. When the Japanese army came again at the end of last year, there were no more houses to burn, and only sixteen residents were killed, because the people were already organized and knew how to deal with them. We pursued them in the mountains when the Japanese army withdrew, and achieved quite a few victories."</p>
<p>When answering the reporter's question about methods of resistance, the magistrate ordered a messenger to bring a broadsword and a pistol and said to the reporter, "This broadsword is forged from parts of the chassis of captured Japanese army trucks. At present, the entire county is equipped with this kind of weapon. We have made thousands of broadswords and a large number of farm implements for the farmers here. When the Japanese army came for the first time, we forced them to abandon more than two hundred trucks when they retreated. After we captured them, we used most of the engines to power our small-scale power plants in the mountains, and used the remaining steel parts to forge weapons and farm implements." The magistrate then showed the reporter a pistol and said, "This was made by ordinary village blacksmiths. It is completely handmade. These blacksmiths have not received any training in manufacturing firearms. The steel raw materials used are all taken from Japanese army trucks." The gun was quite crude, its shape resembling a Mauser pistol. It used 6.5 cm rifle bullets made in China or Japan. It had a straight trajectory and a simple but ingenious firing mechanism. The magistrate further told the reporter that the blacksmiths, with two assistants, could make two of these pistols a day, costing less than five yuan each. These pistols are issued to the local defense corps. Only the regular army has more sophisticated weapons. Once a bullet is fired from this pistol, the cartridge is carefully removed, and it can be reloaded and fired up to six times before it cannot be fired again. The magistrate also showed me a person who could load and fire the gun with his left fingers, as quickly as using a rifle. The reporter was a little apprehensive and fired the gun, and felt that it had quite a bit of recoil. The power of the rifle bullet was much stronger than any similar weapon, and within its range, the bullet was very accurate.</p>
<p>The next morning, we rode towards the Yellow River. The entire population of Pu County, about one hundred and fifty men, women, and children, walked to see us off. The magistrate told the reporter that they were overjoyed by your visit. Since the war began, you are the first outsider to come here. They feel that they have not been forgotten by the outside world.</p>
<p>As we set off and trudged into the mountains, the people shouted slogans such as "Resist to the End Forever" and stood and watched us until we disappeared from sight. On the way out of the city, we passed an enclosure containing the wreckage of six Japanese army trucks, part of the captured truck fleet. Our guards, who were members of the local defense corps, recounted the battles that had taken place around the city three months ago. He had participated in this battle, and happily pointed to the graves scattered on the hillside, telling how each grave contained many people. He then pointed to a grave in the distance and said that eighteen soldiers were buried in it. He then pointed to a grassland where piles of skulls and bones were gleaming white in the sun, and said that the ravines were filled with the corpses of Chinese and Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army, because we were sniping at their supply convoys and their supplies were dwindling, had to abandon the mountains surrounding the city, so we advanced and reoccupied them, and pursued the Japanese army in the mountains, and ambushed them. Today, the Japanese army is planning to invade for the third time. They may be coming, but we are familiar with the local geography and will take advantage of their unpreparedness to launch a sudden attack and cut off their communication lines, until they are forced to retreat again. What the Japanese army has done in Shanxi Province has made us determined to fight them to the end, (Reuters special correspondent, April 2)</p>
<h3>Wu Jingheng Writes an Article - Rebuking Wang Jingwei (2) - The "Two Wangs" Hope to Complete the Puppet Enterprise by Arbitrarily Altering Public Documents to Conceal for the Enemy</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) A. Some people say that Wang's recent publication of "only one example" has two intentions: (1) It is what our friend heard that day when Mrs. Wang gave a "speech to comrades," she said, "To achieve our goal, we must first create a situation where the issue of peace and war can be discussed openly, at least to allow the issue of peace to be discussed as freely as the issue of war. The time has come." Therefore, Wang fired the first cannon, wanting to arouse support or refutation, making a complete mess, attempting to shake people's hearts and destroy the war of resistance, which would make the enemy laugh with joy. But Mr. and Mrs. Wang dare to commit such a treasonous crime, not only completely losing their personal integrity, but also inevitably arousing boundless public indignation. I think your propaganda, besides your colleagues Wang, Liang, and the like, where are there any Chinese people who would believe your treasonous propaganda that would shake them? It's just that you're announcing your own personal bankruptcy. As for refuting a waste of time, I know no one wants to clean a latrine with a smelly rag. I'm at the bottom of the seating, I should make the last contribution. Mr., I think you only believe the enemy and don't believe your friends. You think it's true that the enemy doesn't recognize the National Government as an opponent. You believe it's even more true that the enemy only wants you to be their negotiating partner. So you still say on the surface that you're only advising Japan to negotiate with the National Government, and you can assist from the sidelines as a private citizen. These polite words, I ask you, if you don't collude with the enemy, what qualifications do you have to say that you can go to the enemy country to negotiate with your own government? I believe you're still dreaming this dream hasn't woken up yet, you still think that the enemy only recognizes you as an opponent is true and not deceiving you. So you're still calm and generous, very polite and humble, wanting to advise the enemy country to negotiate with the National Government. But you ask yourself what's in your gourd, what medicine are you selling? Honestly, without being polite, let me expose your trick. Your intention is that when the time is right, you will politely come out and say, now the country has been messed up by you irresponsible, insincere, and ignorant slaves. You should quickly get out of the way and let me do it. On the one hand, you put on a pose of compassion and say, "Since Japan doesn't want the National Government to be their opponent, and the National Government is too embarrassed to ask Japan for peace, then in the end only I, Jingwei, can reluctantly come out to save the country, to be Japan's opponent." Under Konoe's so-called "New Order in East Asia," the "Two Wangs" will jointly complete the great undertaking of the "cooperative body" of Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. Isn't that your plan? This isn't my friend talking nonsense, it's not me joking. Your statement on the ninth, regarding the news published by the Ta Kung Pao on the fifth, that you're colluding with the enemy and selling out the country, acting as a pawn for the Party, and leading the wolf into the house, you still want to defend yourself and refuse to admit it. But the materials and evidence I have are more detailed and accurate than what the Ta Kung Pao published. If a lawsuit is filed, I will have to bring real evidence to the court to prove it. By then, you will have nothing to say, right?</p>
<p>(2) It is to reveal the minutes of the National Defense Council, to make the Wang faction in Hong Kong and other places spread a rumor that "Wang's telegram on the 29th is a duet with the government," with evidence disclosed, just to make people know that the Nanjing meeting and Wang's telegram on the 29th have no causal relationship. It only shows that Wang himself is a person who is uncertain about peace and war, who is fickle. Moreover, in terms of duet, Wang wears a small hat askew, with a face smeared with white powder, performing with hands and feet on the stage, Konoe singing loudly behind his buttocks "New Order," Wang's hands and feet should be combined with the melody, as if it came from his mouth, suddenly Mr. Chiang behind him bitterly rebuking the "New Order," Wang would be stunned on the stage, his hands and feet stiff and motionless. This can be judged by the little brother who is watching the duet, who is Wang performing the duet with? The little brother will shout loudly, what I see on the stage is called "Two Wangs Duet," a joint performance by China and Japan. This is a small problem, I advise the big man Wang not to pay attention to it, if he commits the crime of leaking confidential documents, to be dragged into another amusing story, it is even more not worth it.</p>
<p>(B) Leaking confidential documents under one's own duties and positions is already enough to be a crime, and arbitrarily adding and altering public documents to suit one's own intentions is not what a leader of the masses should do. For example, in Wang's article, it is cited that the German ambassador met with Minister Wang again, claiming that the German ambassador to Japan had spoken with the Japanese Army and Foreign Ministers in Tokyo, inquiring whether Japan wanted to end the current situation, "and it was heard that the Japanese government, if it wanted to end the current situation, under what conditions could it be ended," This is not in the record, but it is to conceal for the enemy the extent to which the enemy wants the German government to mediate peace, so as not to provoke the enemy country's resentment. Also, regarding the question of yesterday, "Detailed methods are technical problems," the record also does not have this. Also, the record of the talks between Tang Mengxiao, Bai Jiansheng, Xu Cichen, Gu Mosan, etc., also does not have this. Also, Ambassador Tao said, "China's resistance to Japan has shown the spirit of resistance, and now it is time to end it. During the European War, there were several good opportunities to seek peace, but in the end we were confident in our own strength and refused to negotiate peace, until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, when we were forced to accept whatever conditions were put forward ×××, in his view, Japan's conditions are not harsh," the record does not have a single word of this. This is what should be stated for the German Ambassador Tao, so as to avoid Ambassador Tao being condemned by his government in Germany and losing our Chinese diplomatic credibility. There are many such small alterations, although they are all of no great importance, they are only suitable for enticing people with the idea of peace. However, for a central figure to be able to forge so freely, even if it is really careless, blinded by greed, to become a puppet, you are so unfaithful to your duties, wouldn't even the little devils be afraid of you, so they dare not take your life? You have to be careful, I think that at the right time, you will definitely have a Gu Rugeng-style ending. Moreover, now you and your wife want to gather "comrades" and cause a small disturbance, how can you control your subordinates, it's all just selling fakes. Su Xiwu was plotted against by his guards, I hope Wang takes care of himself. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>General Pétain Returns to His Country to Report on His Duties - British Ambassador Meets with Spanish Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French ambassador to Spain, General Pétain, returned to Paris today and immediately met with Foreign Minister Bonnet to report on his duties. Political figures believe that Pétain's return to the country is related to the fact that the Italian volunteers in Spain have not yet been completely withdrawn. They also said that the French government is deeply displeased with the Franco government's declaration. The Italian army has already forcibly occupied Albania, and the Italian troops stationed in Spain are still unwilling to withdraw. As a result, Italy's position in the Mediterranean will be greatly enhanced. Therefore, Britain and France are about to send an ultimatum to Franco. However, before sending the ultimatum, they plan to send Ambassador Pétain to Franco again to explain the advantages and disadvantages and persuade him to turn back early. If Franco can pull back from the brink, the overall situation can be turned from danger to safety. (Haitong Telegram on the 10th)</p>

<h3>Mediterranean Interests Threatened - Britain and France Issue Serious Warnings to Italy - If the Territory of Greece and Turkey is Invaded, They Will Not Hesitate to Use Force at the Expense of Sacrifice</h3>
<p>(London) The British Parliament notified Italy yesterday that if Italy further disturbs the European situation with military action, the British government will take a stern attitude. This warning was delivered to the Italian side in Rome and Britain. The article particularly emphasizes Greece and Turkey, which further shows the British side's formal guarantee of the territorial integrity of Greece and Turkey. (Associated Press Telegram on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to diplomatic sources, British Ambassador to Italy, Percy Loraine, has submitted a joint British-French warning to Mussolini, asking him not to make any further territorial expansions. If the status quo of the Mediterranean is further threatened, Britain and France will inevitably use force. At the same time, last night, the French Prime Minister and the French Foreign Minister also had continuous long-distance telephone calls with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Minister Halifax. Regarding whether the Soviet Union can come out to assist the Balkan countries in the event of a European war, French Foreign Minister Bonnet also discussed with the Soviet Ambassador to France. According to diplomatic observations, if Italy does not take any further action after swallowing Albania, Britain and France will not take strong action for a while. However, if Italy is greedy, the situation will inevitably take a sharp turn for the worse. The current efforts of Britain and France are to obtain the consent of Greece, so that Corfu Island can be used as a joint naval base for Britain and France. The intention of Britain is not to openly occupy the island, but only to use it temporarily in the form of a treaty. According to the fact that Greece had already allowed the island to be used by Britain during the autumn when Anglo-Italian relations were extremely bad during Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, it is of course easier to obtain its permission this time. Once this decision is established, Britain can prevent Italy from seizing the island and form assistance to Greece when it is invaded. Britain's policy is to cooperate closely with France, the Soviet Union, and the Balkan countries to maintain the strategic balance in the Adriatic Sea. Britain and France now feel that no matter what Romania's attitude is, the Soviet Union and Turkey must have sufficient power to control the Black Sea and the Dardanelles Strait. Furthermore, although Greece, like Romania and Poland, is unwilling to cooperate militarily with the Soviet Union, if Italy assists Bulgaria in acquiring an outlet to the Aegean Sea, it will definitely encourage the military assistance of the Soviet Union. According to observations here, after Britain warned Italy not to have any ambitions towards Greece, Italy may turn to Yugoslavia for development. If Yugoslavia does not join Britain's "defense system" at that time, it will inevitably be preyed upon by Italy. (Associated Press Telegram on the 11th)</p>
<p>(London) According to today's report, British and French warships are now concentrating at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea. At the same time, British Prime Minister Chamberlain is now making a final effort to negotiate conditions with Mussolini through diplomatic means. If Italy can guarantee that it will not attack Greece and agree to immediately begin withdrawing Italian troops from Spain, then the fact that Italy occupies Albania can be recognized. Political observers believe that if this kind of agreement is impossible, then Chamberlain will declare in the House of Commons on Thursday that the British government is prepared to establish a defensive alliance with Greece and Turkey and will announce the abolition of the Anglo-Italian Friendship Agreement that maintains the status quo in the Mediterranean. The Admiralty refused to release information about the movements of British warships. The plans of Britain and France are clearly for the sake of their Mediterranean interests. It is heard that the two countries are not paying attention to Yugoslavia and are leaving their fate to heaven. At present, Germany and Italy are exerting pressure on Yugoslavia, and after Italy occupied Albania, it has made it impossible for Britain and France to help Yugoslavia except through Romania. Therefore, Britain and France made this decision. Another reason is that Yugoslavia failed to achieve internal unity by resolving the Croatian ethnic issue. It is heard that Britain and France are still in negotiations with Romania. It is heard that the Soviet Union is still expressing doubts about whether Britain really wants to unite the anti-aggression group to stop future aggression.

<h3>The British Government Decides - To Guarantee the Security of the Balkan Countries - Parliament Will Reopen Tomorrow and Issue Important Declarations - Britain and France Maintain Close Diplomatic and Military Cooperation</h3>
<p>(London) According to official sources, Parliament is scheduled to reconvene on the 11th of this month. At that time, Prime Minister Chamberlain will make an extremely important declaration in the House of Commons, stating that Britain is determined to guarantee the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Greece, Turkey, and Romania. At the same time, Foreign Minister Halifax will also make the same declaration in the House of Lords. The Cabinet has just decided on the outline of the declaration at a small group meeting held at 4:00 pm today. Cabinet meetings will also be convened in the next two days to continue discussions in order to create a final draft. According to well-informed sources, the Prime Minister will explain in this declaration to what extent Britain is prepared to accept constraints in order to maintain the status quo in the Balkan Peninsula. (Havas Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently announced that since Italy's invasion of Albania, the British government has intended to provide guarantees to Greece. Up until today, it has also decided to simultaneously guarantee the security of Romania and Turkey. There are three reasons for this: (1) As of today, it is necessary to take immediate action to prevent other parts of Europe from being invaded. (2) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has already provided assurances, stating that he will not threaten Greece. If Britain only provides guarantees to Greece, it will be suspected of criticizing Italy. It is also possible that Italy may take action against Yugoslavia. (3) After Britain provides guarantees to the Balkan countries, it can put moderate pressure on Bulgaria to urge it to join the collective security organization. In short, Britain will provide unilateral guarantees to the Balkan countries. This is the same as the guarantees given to Poland before the agreement was reached between Britain and Poland. Afterwards, the "mutual guarantee" agreement will still be negotiated with each country through diplomatic channels. (Havas Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet Subcommittee is scheduled to discuss foreign policy issues at the Prime Minister's residence this afternoon. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Minister Halifax, and Air Minister Sir Kingsley Wood have made preparations in the morning and consulted on the declaration that the Prime Minister should issue when Parliament reconvenes on the 13th of this month. What is the content of this declaration? It is said that it will depend on Italy's intentions towards Spain. In other words, whether the guarantees provided by Italy to Britain on this issue are reliable will depend on whether Italy can withdraw its volunteers. It will even depend on whether Italy's invasion of Albania is the starting point for large-scale actions in the Mediterranean. The British government, on the one hand, instructed Ambassador Percy Loraine to Italy to make inquiries to the Italian government, and on the other hand, ordered Ambassador Peterson to Spain to negotiate with the Nationalist government, and hopes that each ambassador can submit a report before the Prime Minister issues a declaration on the 13th of this month. According to well-informed sources, Prime Minister Chamberlain believes that if Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is transferred to be the Governor of Albania, and is succeeded by the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Count Grandi, then it is not completely hopeless for Britain and Italy to improve their relations. Outside observers are paying close attention to Italy's large-scale mobilization of reserve soldiers. According to estimates from some sources, the number of mobilized people is no less than one or two million. Moreover, after Poland mobilized a part of its troops, it has not yet demobilized, which shows that the tense relations between Germany and Poland remain the same. Even the Netherlands is taking preventive measures in the military. The anxiety of European countries can be seen from this. However, members of Parliament here still declare that the British government has decided on a plan to deal with all events and has taken preventive measures in vulnerable areas of the British Empire to be on guard. However, this measure is absolutely secret and cannot be known to the outside world. (Havas Telegram on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Responsible officials here recently declared that regarding the incident in Albania, Britain and France have completely consistent views and actions. This can be clearly demonstrated by the parallel measures taken by both sides in diplomacy and military affairs. The French Cabinet was originally scheduled to convene a meeting on the 12th of this month, but it has been brought forward to 4:00 pm tomorrow. At that time, Foreign Minister Bonnet will submit a detailed report, explaining the international situation and the talks between Britain and France, as well as the talks with Eastern European countries. Prime Minister Daladier will explain the progress of yesterday's meeting of the Standing Committee on National Defense. As far as the general public knows, the committee has considered and even made some decisions on the measures to be taken in the event of unexpected events. In addition, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives is scheduled to meet on the 12th of this month. The chairman of the committee, Mistralet, will deliver a speech at that time, explaining the position adopted by the French government in the current international situation. The Council of State is scheduled to hold a regular meeting on the 12th to approve the decisions made by the Cabinet meeting tomorrow. (Havas Telegram on the 10th)</p>

<h3>Yugoslavia Faces Crisis; Follows Lead of Britain and France; Public Demonstrations Against Italy</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia. Today, authoritative sources here firmly believe that the Yugoslav government will follow the lead of Britain and France in dealing with the current crisis. Yugoslavia, given its unfavorable geographical position, believes that it should obtain the assistance of Britain and France. Also, 700 Albanians have volunteered to fight against the Italian army. Most of them are former officials who served in King Zog's government and fled to Yugoslavia. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia. While the government continues to maintain a silent attitude, public sentiment has suddenly turned to hatred of Italy. Small-scale anti-Italian demonstrations took place in Belgrade and Skopje during the holidays. It is said that Italy can now freely block the Adriatic Sea, leaving Yugoslavia with only Salonika as its sole source of maritime supply, apart from circumventing the Bosporus and the upper Danube.

<h3>Turkey's Foreign Policy: Maintaining Friendship with Neighbors; Military Strength Sufficient to Resist Foreign Aggression</h3>
<p>Ankara. The Turkish Grand National Assembly convened here today and passed a government declaration expressing unanimous trust in the government. The government declaration stated that in the current turbulent international situation, Turkey will continue its consistent peaceful policy and maintain good relations with all major and small countries. Turkey is also closely monitoring appropriate steps to deal with the development of the current situation. Thanks to the strength of the Turkish army, the country is no longer in any danger. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Istanbul. Local newspapers, which previously rarely expressed criticism of the international situation, are now showing signs of panic. Major newspapers are describing the current dangers faced by the Balkan countries and urging them to unite and cooperate to prevent future troubles. Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu originally planned to lead a Turkish delegation to Tehran to attend the wedding of the Iranian Crown Prince and the Egyptian Princess on April 16, but this trip has been canceled due to the increasingly serious situation in Europe.

<h3>Netherlands Determined to Maintain Neutrality; Defensive Measures Taken at Border</h3>
<p>Amsterdam. Dutch Prime Minister Colijn delivered a broadcast speech today, expressing the Netherlands' determination to maintain neutrality at all costs, pointing out that this is the sole reason why military plans were implemented on the Dutch border yesterday, and declaring that there is absolutely no reason for anxiety or unease. Colijn's wording was very solemn and cautious, saying that the special plans implemented at the border should not be seen as implying that the country is under any direct threat, and stressing that the country's foreign relations are consistently friendly. However, in view of the general situation in Europe, as a precautionary measure and to reassure the public, measures have been taken at the border. What the Netherlands wants to express is that the Netherlands is determined to maintain its independence and neutrality in all circumstances and towards all parties. There is no reason to believe that the government fears a direct threat. The special plans that have been implemented will continue to be maintained until the situation returns to calm. At the same time, Colijn urged the people of the country to go about their business with peace of mind. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Exchange of Letters Between British and Italian Prime Ministers; Contents Unknown</h3>

<h3>Italy Calls Up Reservists; Army Exceeds One Million; Claims Italy Will Advance into Salonika if Britain Occupies the Dodecanese Islands</h3>
<p>(Rome) Since January of this year, the Italian government has been calling up reservists from the classes of 1901 to 1914 in batches. As of now, its army strength is said to have exceeded one million. However, according to some sources, the reservists of the 1912 and 1914 classes were recently called up to replace the troops stationed in Italian Libya in North Africa. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is reported that reservists of all classes were drafted today to supplement the troops sent to Albania, most of whom are from the 1912 class. It is said that the term of enlistment will not be long. The total number, according to official announcements, is 200,000. After news of Britain's decision on the Albanian issue, which will be decided by Parliament, reached here, all political circles in Italy hope that Britain will not take any action against Italy that is stronger than issuing diplomatic notes. At the same time, Italy is now jealous of the comments made by various parties regarding the Dodecanese Islands of Greece. Some circles claim that if British troops occupy the Dodecanese Islands to resist Italy, Italy will advance into Salonika. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Axis Powers Expanding Influence; President Roosevelt Deeply Concerned About European Situation; Anticipates Outbreak of War in Europe This Autumn; Plans to Promote Revision of Neutrality Act to Effectively Assist Democratic Countries</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt returned here yesterday from Warm Springs and is extremely worried about European events. Upon arrival, the President met with Secretary of State Hull and is expected to consult again today, at which time Hull will submit a report on European developments. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt returned to the capital yesterday from Warm Springs. When he left, he told his neighbors that if war does not break out in Europe, he will return to this place in the fall of this year. Observers here commented that the White House and the State Department are pessimistic about the European situation, as can be seen from the President's remarks. Secretary of State Hull also said that after a large amount of funds from European countries flows into the United States, the purchasing power of those countries may decrease. The intention is to inform the people that if the European situation continues to be turbulent, the US economy will be greatly affected and cannot be ignored. In addition, political figures also said that the reason why the US authorities are sparing no effort to discuss the serious situation in Europe is due to three ideas: (1) The plan of the Berlin-Rome Axis to divide spheres of influence in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean is being rapidly implemented. Britain and France want to form a security line to contain it. Judging from the evolution of the situation, the two sides will soon clash, outside of foreign policy. (2) The US authorities have decided to suggest to Congress and public opinion that the government's attitude is indeed correct and that its decision to support Britain and France is also beneficial. (3) The current Neutrality Act Amendment will be submitted to Congress for discussion in a short period of time. The government urgently wants to exert influence on members of Congress as much as possible so that the Neutrality Act can be amended according to the government's views, and the United States can provide effective assistance to Britain and France in peacetime and wartime. According to some sources, if the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees do not make rapid progress in reviewing the Neutrality Act Amendment, President Roosevelt may personally attend to inform them that the European situation is so serious that it is not appropriate to delay the decision any longer.

<h3>US Plans to Add Naval Air Bases in Two Oceans; Senate Naval Committee Passes Amendment; Plan to Fortify Guam Vetoed</h3>
<p>(Washington) The bill proposed by House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson to add 12 naval air bases was passed by the House on February 23 after amendments. In addition to eliminating the clause in the original bill to build an airfield on Guam, the total budget was reduced from $52,000,000 to $47,000,000. It was then submitted to the Senate Naval Committee for discussion. The committee recently passed an amendment today, proposing to add $18,000,000 to the budget already approved by the House, with $17,000,000 to add a naval air base at Jacksonville, Florida, and the remaining $1,000,000 to purchase land at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, in the Atlantic, for the purpose of establishing a naval air base. The clause to build an airfield on Guam has also been vetoed. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>US Plans to Stockpile Wartime Raw Materials; Cotton and Wheat Supplied to Britain, Netherlands, and Belgium in Exchange for Rubber and Tin</h3>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator Byrnes advocates a great international raw material exchange plan that has the dual effect of creating the war power of democratic countries and eliminating America's surplus agricultural products. Byrnes suggested that the United States should exchange cotton and wheat with Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries for rubber and tin. Government officials and powerful groups in the Senate are quite supportive of the plan. The State Department and the Department of Agriculture also expressed sympathy. According to Byrnes, the State Department will propose large-scale transactions to foreign governments within a few days. The Department of the Army and the Department of the Navy now want to reserve at least 226,000 tons of rubber, or 250,000 tons for adequate use, and propose to reserve $65 million worth of tin ingots. According to this plan, raw materials will be stockpiled, and the countries that obtain them cannot sell them within five years unless the price has exceeded the stipulated figure. Byrnes estimates that the 11 million bales of borrowed cotton stored by the government can be sold for at least 2 million bales if handled according to his plan. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>European Gold Flows Steadily to the US</h3>
<p>(New York) Gold from European countries is still flowing steadily to the United States. A total of $49 million worth was transported here today by the "President Harding" and "Zaandam."

<h3>Hiranuma Raving Mad Again; Policy Towards China Unchanged; Military, Political, and Cultural Aggression Proceeding Simultaneously; Excluding Foreign Forces, Meaning Implied</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Prime Minister Kiichirō Hiranuma delivered a speech yesterday at the "Asia Development Board," declaring that Japan's policies towards China and the Far East will follow the current route without any change. Hiranuma continued, "The purpose of the 'Asia Development Board' is to seek close cooperation between the Japanese army and relevant departments in order to achieve the goal of cultural, economic, and political unification between China and Japan." Hiranuma finally pointed out that Japan has no intention of interfering with the rights and interests of third countries in the Far East, "but only to the extent that it does not endanger Japan's national defense and interests." (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Supervises Industrial Institutions; Assigns Officials as Directors, Subject to Severe Criticism by Parliament</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The government's practice of assigning former officials to serve as directors of official auxiliary companies has been severely criticized by the Diet. Various political parties have lodged strong protests against this move by the government. Many officials are appointed as senior personnel in state-run companies immediately after resigning. This trend has become more prevalent since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and the number of opponents has increased. The prominent financial newspaper Chugai Commercial News stated that there is no doubt that this approach has various drawbacks. When the various political parties initially expressed their opposition, the government replied that this move was necessary to implement government supervision. We are not clear about this attitude. The government can issue regulations to fulfill its responsibilities of ensuring and supervising, without having to appoint officials as directors of various companies. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Albania Loses Independence; US Considers Recalling Ambassador</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Italian invasion of Albania, the US government has not expressed any intention to protest to Italy. Those in the know say that the US government may consider this and recall the US Ambassador to Albania, Mr. Grant, because the Provisional Administrative Committee of Albania has pledged allegiance to the Italian government, and the country no longer has independent sovereignty. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Aggressor Nation Condemned; Conscience Pierced</h3>
<p>(Washington) The abusive attacks by Italian newspapers on the US government are well-received by those in the know. They claim that these attacks are sufficient to show that President Roosevelt's strong policy has had the effect of piercing the conscience of the aggressor. The US government was the first in the world to condemn the conquest of Czechoslovakia and Albania, and will continue to condemn any act of aggression thereafter. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Italian Troops Invading Albania Penetrate Deep into the Mountains; Oil Fields Usurped</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italy has dispatched a large number of troops to land at various ports in Albania, following the Italian mechanized units advancing towards Shkodër, Tirana, Tepelena, Argirocastro, and other places. The mechanized units encountered resistance from Albanian troops in Shkodër. Albanian troops built trenches in the mountain roads there to rely on the dangerous terrain and hold their ground to prevent the advance of Italian troops, but after the battle, they were defeated by the Italian army, and the city of Shkodër was occupied. All the goods in the city were intact and undamaged. The Tepelena oil fields near the city have also been occupied by the Italian army. (Haitong, 11th)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Resets Its Policy: Reliance on Nationalism —Not Relying on Agreements—</h3>
<p>— Specially Written</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, France, these two major countries had formed a mutual assistance pact, believing they had a mountain to rely on. Who knew that when danger arrived, these two allies would stand idly by, watching her be slaughtered and occupied. If there hadn't been a mutual assistance pact, without consulting others, she might have put up a valiant resistance against the enemy. Although she still couldn't have avoided destruction, she could have had a swift and decisive end. But as it was, she could neither be a shattered jade nor a broken tile, and "alas" she died in a confused and unclear way. France and the Soviet Union naturally cannot escape their blame, and those who signed the Munich Agreement are truly the chief culprits. However, when that agreement was made, many people praised Chamberlain for averting a great disaster and for his hard work and great achievements, saying that selfish people, as long as they could preserve their own lives and property, what did sacrificing a Czechoslovakia matter? How could they feel any pain? I, however, had already overthrown the peacemaking old man who called himself the "Hundred Tolerances." But heaven does not protect the wicked, and those who commit evil will surely reap the consequences. Hitler's ambition was insatiable, seeking more after acquiring something. After annexing Czechoslovakia, he extended his greedy tongue to Poland and Romania. As a result, Chamberlain also felt that the flames of Nazism were about to burn his own eyebrows. Fearing that Poland and Romania would become "Czechoslovakia the Second," "Czechoslovakia the Third," and then one or two more "Czechoslovakia the Fourth" and "Czechoslovakia the Fifth," and that Britain might become "Czechoslovakia the Sixth," he stopped being the "Hundred Tolerances" Zhang Gong and boldly announced, "From now on, I will resist German aggression." On the one hand, he hurriedly guaranteed the security of Poland and Romania, and on the other hand, he took advantage of Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to London to conclude the "Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance Pact." It is true that Chamberlain has changed his policy, but who dares to guarantee that this agreement will not end up with the same results as the "Franco-Czech Pact," the "Soviet-Czech Pact," and the "Munich Agreement"? Thus, the gentlemen who flattered Chamberlain again praised, "Old Mr. Zhang has made a great determination this time, which can be called a new era in history." Isn't it too early to say that! Just seeing British Secretary of the Navy Earl Stanhope say a few boastful words, Chamberlain became panicked. On the one hand, he asked the newspapers not to publish them, and on the other hand, he declared in the House of Commons that these words were not directed at any country. Furthermore, he has not yet invited the Soviet Union, a country capable of strongly resisting aggression, to join the collective security system because of Poland's opposition. This clearly shows that Chamberlain is still hesitant and cannot fully implement his new policy. Now that Italy has conquered Albania, Britain feels even more acute pain. Whether Chamberlain has the great determination to resist aggression will be seen in the next few days. A few months ago, the London National Magazine said, "Great Britain has decided that she must remain a great power and a protector of fairness, freedom, and justice, and that it is time to fall and become a vehicle for an omnipotent nation." How much more so now? However, even today, can Britain still call itself the protector of fairness, freedom, and justice for the surviving people of Czechoslovakia? Now, turning to the Soviet Union, its attitude towards the Western democratic countries is neither close nor distant. It is a powerful force among the democratic countries. British Eden, Lloyd George, and the Labor Party, and American Stimson, among others, all advocate, "To vigorously resist aggressive countries, we must unite with the Soviet Union." The actions of the Soviet Union are what everyone is paying attention to today. Mr. Chelton, a correspondent for the British Daily Telegraph and the Morning Post stationed in Moscow, had a letter mentioning the impact of the Munich Agreement on the Soviet Union and the new policies it has adopted as a result. I am translating it below. I think those who care about the European situation will definitely want to read it.</p>
<p>On the twenty-first anniversary of the founding of the Red Army (February 23), all members of the Red Army, from generals to recruits, had to read a new oath, which was very different from the "Red Oath" of the Lenin era of international class warfare. This time, the oath no longer contains words such as "Children of the working class, wholeheartedly and wholeheartedly strive to achieve the goal of liberating all workers in order to uphold socialism," but only the words "Soviet citizens are willing to step forward to defend their motherland," which is essentially the same as the oaths of any other national defense force. Under the strict guidance of Stalin, the tendency of Soviet Bolshevism towards "nationalization" has never been as widespread as this registration oath.</p>
<p>Some say that the Soviet Union's intervention in the Spanish Civil War shows the hypocrisy of the new oath, but that is not the case. Although the Soviet Union did command the air war of the Spanish Republican Army in 1937, it only lasted for one or two months and was strictly kept secret (Soviet newspapers never admitted that the Soviet Union had sent a single soldier to Spain). In addition, it was too late, and the assistance was only in the form of materials, military advisors, tanks, air force personnel, and anti-aircraft gunners, totaling just over 1,200 people.</p>
<h3>The Impact of the Munich Agreement</h3>
<p>Regardless of what the Third International did before, since the real outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the Soviet Union's policy has been to encourage the "People's Front" of moderate elements within the Republican Army to resist the extremists. The Communist Party previously used destructive tactics to contain the German left wing, which greatly helped Hitler seize power. Moscow has greatly learned from this bitter lesson. This is partly due to Soviet idealism, but the Soviet Union's decision to take action in Spain was largely based on a defensive "power politics" attempt to make France take on large-scale intervention obligations in Spain and to strengthen the "People's Front" government then in power. She believed that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact would thus increase in strength. The Soviet Union joined the League of Nations because of its compliance with this pact. The Soviet Union, like Germany, always kept Czechoslovakia in its heart. Czechoslovakia was connected to France and the Slavic powers, which were then in a defensive position in Western Europe. The Munich Agreement tore up the Soviet-Czech Pact, and thus the Franco-Soviet Pact also became a dead letter, thus ruining the last hope that people often held: Soviet participation in the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>The crisis in September occurred when the Soviet Union was undergoing a transformation, and the Soviet Union was quite embarrassed at the time. Stalin's purge of the army and internal affairs originally hoped to eventually achieve the goal of strengthening "nationalization," so it had to be temporarily relaxed. Stalin's original intention was to sacrifice at least 75% of officers above the rank of colonel. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Tense Situation Suddenly Appears in Changzhou, Residents Flee to the Countryside</h3>
<p>Changzhou Correspondence: After the mobile troops of the Chinese army suddenly became active in the Eastern Theater, Wujin County, along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, and Yixing and Qiaoxi on the Wuyi Highway were advanced by the Chinese army, and a great chaos occurred in Yicheng under Japanese and puppet control. Residents in Wuyi City, affected by this, also packed their goods and fled to the countryside. Some even stopped loading goods ordered from Shanghai. Lai Ti, the puppet county magistrate, and Aijia, the head of the Japanese special service team, went to the outside of the West Gate the day before yesterday to explain to the shops with sweet words, hoping to cover up the situation, but the order of the residents was still chaotic.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Rice Merchants Plan to Transport Rice, Japanese and Puppet Restrictions Lead to Stagnant Market</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Rice and silk cocoons are the main businesses in Wuxi. However, silk cocoon production directly benefits farmers. It is hoped that the output will be abundant and the cocoon price will be high, which will greatly benefit the rural economy. The rice industry, however, cannot meet the food needs of the county's residents with the county's production alone. The prosperity of the rice market depends entirely on the large-scale transportation of rice from various rice-producing areas to Wuxi. Rice merchants from various places come to Wuxi to purchase rice, the source is abundant, and the sales are very smooth, so rice merchants can make profits and indirectly prosper other industries, which is beneficial to the entire social economy. Since the outbreak of the war, transportation in various inland counties has been blocked, and the transportation of goods has been unsmooth. The daily necessities of the people are becoming more expensive due to the lack of sources. The rice grain, which is related to the food problem of the people, is also becoming scarcer and the inventory is low, and it is even more controlled by the Japanese and puppets. Rice merchants from Shanghai come to Wuxi to purchase rice continuously, and the rice price has risen from about ten yuan to thirteen or fourteen yuan. After the puppet government banned exports, the rice price fell by more than two yuan. Now the source is abundant, and rice and paddy rice stored in various rice mills and warehouses have reached more than 300,000 dans. The rice industry has been banned from transportation for half a month. Rice mills and rice shops have no business to operate, and they have stopped their machines one after another. More than 10,000 workers have suddenly lost their livelihoods. If rice grain is strictly prohibited from being moved out for a long time, it will be no different from a dead market. Rice merchants who came to Wuxi to sell rice left for other places because there was no way to sell it. In a blink of an eye, wheat will be on the market, and there will be no need to worry about the food of the people. Rice merchants have been quite anxious since the puppet government issued the ban on transportation. They held a meeting the day before yesterday to find a way to relax the ban on grain transportation, but the Japanese and puppets have not yet approved it. They need to discuss solutions in the short term and make a decision.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in Hangzhou Forcibly Recruit Refugees into Military Service, the Old, Weak, Women and Children are Also Forced to Work</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The special service agency of the Japanese army in Hangzhou set up a refugee shelter in Jingsi Temple in the West Lake in August last year under the pretext of providing relief to refugees. It detained homeless men, women, old, and young refugees and forced the refugees to work for the Japanese army. The refugees had no choice but to endure it temporarily due to the environment. However, recently, the Japanese army lured young and strong teenagers in the shelter to the suburbs under the pretext of helping with work, organized them into troops, and trained them in order to supplement the quotas of the original teams. However, most of the strong men expressed their unwillingness, so three of them tried to escape by taking advantage of the opportunity. In the end, they were caught in the middle of the way due to the strict precautions of the Japanese and died tragically. Since then, the Japanese army has tied up the batch of strong men with ropes every night for transportation. In addition, there are old and weak refugees in the shelter. Except for young children who were transported to Japan, more than 130 other women and children have been forced to work at the "Huazhong Silk Company" and the "Sanyou Industrial Society" and "Guanghua Match Company" in Gongbu.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Prepares to Change Secondary School Curriculum, Convening Education Commissioners and Experts for Discussion</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) After the Third National Education Conference, the Ministry of Education convened a discussion meeting on secondary school curriculum standards. More than 20 education commissioners and experts from education departments across the country, including Huang Yanpei, Zhou Shang, Jiang Wenyu, Zhong Daozan, and Zeng Kezhong, were hosted by Gu Juechang Yuxiu and Gu Sizhang Shusen of the Ministry of Education. The discussion lasted all day, and the results are as follows: (1) The total number of teaching hours per week for each subject in secondary school shall not exceed 30 hours. This total number of hours is determined and regulated based on the analysis and distribution of students' healthy lives. (2) In the junior high school curriculum, the changes to be made include increasing the number of hours for hygiene, changing "plants and animals" to "biology," and changing "English" to "foreign language," while inland areas may appropriately change to teaching vocational subjects according to local needs. (3) There are no major changes to the senior high school curriculum. The main changes are (A) increasing hygiene, (B) reducing Chinese language class hours, (C) reducing mathematics class hours, (D) reducing English class hours, (E) reducing modern history class hours, (F) increasing domestic history and geography and reducing foreign history and geography. (4) The curriculum for a six-year integrated secondary school will be drafted by the Ministry and then seek opinions from all parties. This discussion of the secondary school curriculum is entirely the basis for modifying the curriculum when the curriculum committee is organized in the future, so it is extremely important. However, the implementation date must wait until three years later. It takes time to formulate new standards, develop teaching material outlines, and edit textbooks. It is not until the textbooks and other materials have been edited and written that they can be promulgated and adopted.</p>
<h3>Guangxi Provincial Government Implements Cave Education in Guilin, Currently There are Eighteen Large Cave Schools</h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) The Guangxi Provincial Government recently accepted Mr. Tao Xingzhi's suggestion to use a cave in Guilin to implement cave education, which can be unaffected by Japanese bombing. This is a major initiative in the history of education. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cave Education: Guilin is surrounded by mountains on all sides outside the city, with towering peaks and numerous caves, hence the saying "Guilin's landscape is the best in the world." Since the War of Resistance, Japanese planes have often bombed the area, and schools have been unable to hold classes in the morning, and libraries have also stopped lending books. Caves are the best natural air-raid shelters, so after Mr. Tao Xingzhi returned to China, he suggested to the provincial government to implement cave education measures, making each large cave a wartime public school and each small cave a classroom. The Guangxi Provincial Government originally designated 1939 as the year of adult education, planning to have all 13 million Guilin residents fully receive education on resistance against Japan. Therefore, it immediately adopted Tao's suggestion and implemented cave education, making cave education a suitable venue for implementing adult education, which is a major initiative in the history of education.</p>
<p>Wartime Public Schools: There are eighteen large caves in Guilin, including Kanniu Cave, Jiaohua Cave, Mulong Small Cave, Duihua Cliff, Old Man Mountain, Guo Jiahou Rock, Liu Ma Mountain, Jiugangguan, Cenggong Cliff, Huanzhu Cave, Seven Star Cave, Seven Star Hou Cave, Longyin Cave, Laojun Cave, Elephant Trunk Hill, Yashui Rock, Guniu Mountain, and Bailong Cave. Among them, the Seven Star Cave is the largest, reaching one mile in depth and capable of holding 20,000 people. It has now been transformed into a wartime public school, with teachers and students from Hanmin Middle School, which moved from Beijing, Jiangsu Education Institute, which moved from Wuxi, and the China Vocational Education Society, which moved from Shanghai, as well as the Propaganda Assault Team of the Military Commission, the Xin'an Traveling Troupe, the Children's Theater Troupe, and film projection teams serving as teachers.</p>
<p>Educational Content: The educational content in the caves includes six items: drama, singing, life guidance, current affairs reports, knowledge of war, and stories of resistance against Japan. In addition, there are radio broadcasts and film screenings. In the radio broadcasts, one can listen to reports from the air defense headquarters on the movements of Japanese aircraft and disaster conditions. The screening of films, especially realistic films of the battlefield, can greatly increase the spirit of resistance against Japan. In the mountain depressions next to the caves, there are salvation libraries and reading rooms for the public to read. War maps, comic strips, and photographs are hung on the stone walls, which are quite stimulating.</p>
<p>Full Text of Resolutions of the Third National Education Conference (6) Proposal for Improving Secondary Education (Part 1) (Special Correspondent Yi Sheng from Chongqing Airmail)</p>
<p>The resolution on improving secondary education passed by the National Education Conference is as follows:</p>
<p>Secondary education is originally a preparation for students to enter higher education and is the most important stage in the entire education system. The main points of this plan are (1) creating a six-year secondary school to improve the level of secondary education, (2) revising the teaching curriculum to adapt to modern needs, (3) emphasizing production labor training to develop habits of using both hands and mind, (4) vigorously implementing vocational guidance to examine youth's personalities and indicate pathways for further education and employment. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The secondary school system and goals should be changed appropriately</p>
<p>1. In addition to the original three-three system of secondary schools, a six-year integrated secondary school should be established, without distinguishing between junior and senior high school. 2. (1) A six-year integrated secondary school will be implemented in a portion of schools in several provinces and cities designated by the Ministry of Education for experimentation. (2) A portion of the curriculum in the third grade of junior high school should be divided and implemented separately to facilitate students to study for further education or employment. English may be optional in the third school year. 3. One year may be added on top of the three years of junior high school, with a simple vocational course attached. 4. Senior and junior high schools prepare students for further education and also cultivate middle and junior-level talents for general social undertakings.</p>
<p>(2) Divide secondary school districts to determine the establishment of secondary schools (see proposals in the education administration category)</p>
<p>1. Each province should consider the transportation, population, economy, culture, and distribution of existing schools in various places to divide the entire province into several secondary school districts. 2. The number of secondary schools in each secondary school district in the province should be appropriately distributed. Each district should have at least one secondary school. 3. Junior high schools should be established on a county-by-county basis in principle, but impoverished areas may designate a central location in several counties for establishment. 4. The number of students enrolled each year in secondary schools in each district and the number of grades added should be determined by the provincial education department based on the number of primary school graduates in the district who are seeking further education.</p>
<p>(3) Revision and Formulation of Secondary School Curriculum Standards</p>
<p>1. English in junior high school may be changed to an elective course. 2. Students who do not study English in junior high school can study Chinese language, history, geography, labor (with housework as the main focus for girls), or simple vocational subjects. 3. A labor course should be added to the first grade of senior high school, and a simple vocational elective course may still be offered in the second and third grades. 4. The curriculum for the six-year integrated secondary school should be formulated. The important principles are as follows: (1) The entire curriculum for each subject does not need to be a double circle but a consistent straight line allocation. (2) A labor course should still be listed in grades one to four. (3) History and geography should be listed together, with domestic history and domestic geography accounting for two-thirds and foreign history and foreign geography accounting for one-third. (4) Foreign languages should be gradually increased from the fourth year onwards. 5. After the revised junior and senior high school curriculum standards and the six-year secondary school curriculum standards are formulated, the key points of the teaching materials for each subject should be drafted as the basis for editing textbooks and teaching.</p>
<p>(4) Emphasis on Production Labor Training 1. Male students in junior and senior high schools and secondary schools must study agriculture or industry, and female students must study housework and gardening. In cities and commercially developed areas, both male and female students may also study commerce. 2. The equipment standards for the labor course should be stipulated, and all public and private secondary schools in each province and city should set them up accordingly. 3. The curriculum and practical standards for agriculture, industry, commerce, and housework must be detailed and implemented by each school accordingly. 4. It should be stipulated that each student in senior and junior high schools and secondary schools must reach the predetermined skill and quantity standards in each semester, regardless of what kind of production practice they are engaged in. 5. Regarding the training of labor teachers in primary schools, in addition to special normal courses offered by normal schools, each province and city should designate excellent vocational schools to attach labor teacher training classes, recruit graduates from senior vocational schools, and provide them with one year of training. Regarding the training of labor teachers in secondary schools, labor teacher specialty courses should be attached to normal colleges and universities or designated excellent senior vocational schools, recruit graduates from senior vocational schools, and the duration of study should be two to three years.</p>

<h3>Under the Power of the Xiamen Gang, Cash Fluctuations are Quite Smooth, and the European Situation Temporarily Relaxes, with the Decline Not as Bad as Expected</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash market fluctuations were quite smooth, with the situation stable but weak. Although the current European situation is temporarily relaxed, people still feel uneasy. In addition, the Hong Kong exchange rate is potentially loose and cheap. Combined with the continued selling by gold shops and money changers, despite the Xiamen Gang's support from a certain gold shop's strong buying at one point, the price ultimately failed to rise and fell by two yuan. Trading was flat, only about 600 taels were traded. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged. There was no change in the Central Bank's customs gold, etc., due to the closure of the London gold market.</p>
<p>Cash Market Down Two Yuan</p>
<p>Starting in the morning, sentiment was slightly weak, with many offering to sell at 2,068 yuan per 10 taels, while buyers were only willing to absorb at 3-4 yuan lower. The two sides argued until 9:50 AM when a certain gold shop suddenly took over the Xiamen Gang's buying, and a deal was made. The first trade was a gold shop buying 50 taels each from the jewelry gang and money changers, all at 2,068 yuan, the opening price, which was unchanged from the close last Thursday (i.e., before the Spring Festival holiday). After the opening, the same gold shop bought another 100 taels from the same industries at the same price. Soon after, money changers sold 10 taels to the jewelry gang at 66 yuan. Later, the same gold shop came to buy again, taking 50 taels each from the jewelry gang and peers, all at 68 yuan. Then, the jewelry gang traded 50 taels among themselves at the same price. Later, money changers traded 50 taels among themselves for 66 yuan. Because the deal was slightly less successful, the price was set at 62 yuan. Near noon, money changers traded 50 taels among themselves again, with 66 yuan as the closing price. Trading was unusually quiet in the afternoon, and the price also rarely changed. Only 50 taels were traded from the money changers to the jewelry gang, priced at 66 yuan. Later, a certain money changer still wanted to sell at 66 yuan, but the buyer offered 65 yuan. The two sides were deadlocked until after 4:00 PM, and no deal was made. Therefore, the closing price was still 2,066 yuan, a drop of two yuan compared to last Thursday (i.e., before the Spring Festival holiday). The cash shop's full offer was sold at 2,070 yuan and bought at 2,060 yuan. The current standard gold price is 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and no trades have been made.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Prices Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>Jewelry gold retail prices remained unchanged because cash prices rarely changed. Datong Bank was 210 yuan, and Xintong Bank was 208 yuan, buying at 202 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Gold Prices Also Unchanged</p>
<p>The Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash remained at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price for customs gold was still calculated at 2.396 yuan per tael. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207.6 yuan, due to the closure of London gold market for the Easter holiday and the lack of updates.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Rises Alone, Foreign Banks Trade US Dollars Against Hong Kong Telegrams and Enter British Remittances</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw a temporary calm in Europe, and exchange rates between Britain and the United States remained largely unchanged during the holiday. This stabilized sentiment in the local market. Although major foreign firms and the Tianjin Gang attempted to intervene, foreign banks such as HSBC showed greater willingness, so the situation remained largely unchanged. As a result, there was no gain or loss. However, foreign banks engaged in some short-term dollar trading, and Hong Kong telegrams also entered British and American, and foreign banks such as Huabi swapped British and American exchange rates, totaling 4 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen, and 1 li. Trading was quite active throughout the day. However, because of weak telecommunications, the Hong Kong exchange rate was under strong selling pressure from foreign banks and money changers and tended to loosen.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large-denomination near-term was long at .0625, while the long-term remained unchanged. New York silver prices remained fixed, and London gold prices also showed no increase or decrease. The exchange rates for British to US, to Shanghai, and to France were all flat. US to British, to Shanghai were also flat, and to France was largely increasing (all compared to the close last Thursday). The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Bank's morning selling prices were 8 pence 25 for British exchange and 16.0625 yuan for US exchange. Both British and US exchange rates were unchanged compared to the closing last Thursday (i.e., before the Spring Festival holiday). After opening, although foreign firms and the Tianjin Gang mutually intervened, foreign banks were quite willing to fulfill orders, resulting in a lack of change. Foreign firms settled at HSBC British exchange rate of 8 pence 25, also on behalf of the Tianjin Gang settled with HSBC and Huabi British exchange rate of 8 pence 25. HSBC's listed price was announced, and the Hong Kong exchange rate alone rose by 75, while the rest were flat. The silver balance tax was announced to be larger than last Thursday, calculated as 5.00%. Later, foreign banks and Dutch banks mutually bought US exchange rates from a certain bank at 16.0625 yuan for April. Then, foreign firms absorbed US exchange rates from a certain bank at 16.025 yuan, so the potential situation remained largely unchanged. Later, foreign firms absorbed Dutch drafts at 55.75 yuan. Then, money changers sold Guangdong Hong Kong exchange (bills) at 56.25 yuan to foreign banks and Huahang. The situation was also stable. At noon, Hong Kong telegrams suddenly entered British and American markets, and Huabi exchanged British and American exchange rates with foreign banks, totaling 4 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen, and 1 li. By closing at noon, the bank's selling price was the same as the morning opening.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, foreign firms continued to intervene, with Huilan British exchange rate at 8 pence 25, and Huabi US exchange rate was also purchased at 16.0625 yuan. The process was also quite stable. After entering, due to the Hong Kong exchange rate's potentially weak outlook, foreign banks, especially Anta, vigorously sold, and the potential situation trended towards loosening. Anta sold Hong Kong exchange rates to foreign firms, hardening from 55.75 yuan to 56 yuan. By the closing of the evening, the bank's selling prices were British exchange at 8 pence 25 and US exchange at 16.0625 yuan. As a result, the British and American exchange rates were unchanged compared to before the Spring Festival holiday, while the Hong Kong exchange rate hardened by 25.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fresh Gold Notes: Fatigue and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British gold and British-American exchange rates were both closed due to holidays. Because the port was opening, the local foreign exchange market saw strong settlements by foreign firms. Fortunately, with the continuous supply from banks and Hong Kong telegrams, the market price remained stable, with no gains or losses compared to before the closure. The cash customs market was still stable. Later, because of the large amount of jewelry gold from the mainland being brought to Shanghai and ample funds, gold shops and jewelry businesses sold heavily, and the market price was temporarily weak. Later, the Hong Kong gang of money changers took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and the decline gradually subsided. Afternoon trading was not strong, and the trend was sideways. The result was slightly soft. Large amounts of foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds were issued, but the demand was scarce. Foreign banks absorbed British and American gold notes heavily. The supply of Japanese fresh gold notes was quite smooth, and the market price became increasingly weak. Although the import of Japanese goods to Shanghai was strong, Japanese businessmen mostly exchanged for foreign exchange for collection, which did not help their national economy much. The excessive issuance of military pay by their military headquarters was scattered in various guerrilla areas in large numbers, and the people did not dare to keep it, so the supply was very high. There were few transactions in the exchange. Only Huitong issued and Xiang Kang received Hong Kong notes for 500 yuan, and Yingfeng issued and Hongchang received Hong Kong notes for 500 yuan. Yesterday's market prices compared to before the closure: British gold pound decreased by 1 jiao, British order notes decreased by 1 fen, American gold pound decreased by 2 jiao, American gold notes decreased by 2 li, Hong Kong notes increased by 2 li, French franc notes decreased by 2 hao, and the prices of other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Market Stable, Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 11th Telegram: The opening exchange rate for British-American and Shanghai Exchange rates in the morning was the same as the price at 2:30 PM on the 6th. At 11:30 AM, the Shanghai Exchange rate increased by 2 jiao and 5 fen, with a price of 178 yuan. By 3:35 PM, the Shanghai Exchange rate had fallen back by 1 jiao and 2 fen and 5 li, with a price of 177.875 yuan. The British and American exchange rates remained unchanged throughout the day. The opening market prices in the morning are listed below:</p>
<p>British Exchange: 1 shilling, 2 pence, 6875</p>
<p>American Exchange: 28.625 yuan</p>
<p>Shanghai Exchange: 177.75 yuan (Shanghai Exchange is the amount of Shanghai legal tender equal to 100 Hong Kong dollars)</p>
<p>Tianjin, 11th Telegram: Compared with the 6th (last Thursday), the British and American exchange rates were unchanged, and the China Exchange rate increased by 2 jiao and 5 fen. The opening market prices in the morning are listed below:</p>
<p>British Exchange: 7 pence, 875</p>
<p>American Exchange: 15.375 yuan</p>
<p>Shanghai Exchange: 104.25 yuan (Shanghai Exchange is the amount of Tianjin that should be received for every 100 Shanghai yuan)</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Opened Yesterday, Check Exchange Time Delayed by 30 Minutes</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of opening for the silver and money industry after the four-day Tomb Sweeping Festival holiday. All banks and firms were quite busy handling receipts and deliveries. The Bank Check Clearing House specially delayed the exchange time by 30 minutes, starting the exchange at 3:30 PM to facilitate check clearing for its members (the original exchange time was 3:00 PM every day).</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bills of exchange gradually declined. It once fell to a low of 49 yuan per thousand yuan, but eventually rebounded slightly, with a final rate of 49 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, a drop of 2 jiao and 5 fen compared to before the holiday (6th).</p>
<h3>American Silver Unchanged, British and Indian Closed</h3>
<p>New York, 10th Telegram: The price of American spot silver remained fixed, initially at 4 jiao and 2 fen and 75 li. The price of British and Indian silver was not available due to the Easter holiday closure.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Firm and High, Foreign Stocks Also Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities dark market situation, after a four-day holiday, had quite a few ins and outs in terms of environmental news. Suddenly it was said that the exchange was about to be auctioned, and suddenly it was said that there was no such thing. Suddenly it was said that the British ambassador went to Chongqing with peace negotiation conditions, and suddenly it was refuted. Suddenly there was also peaceful news from Chongqing. There were many arguments, but the only logical explanation was that there was a reason for the incident, but no evidence. Because the news was uncertain, sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing, it aroused the interest of speculators. Other things like the European situation, although there was already a tense situation, the door to peace was not closed. However, in the domestic war, it has been quite dominant in the past few days. Guangzhou is not difficult to recover. There are also reports from Nanjing that the Japanese are preparing to withdraw because the Guangzhou climate does not suit them. This shows that they are making this cover-up due to unfavorable war conditions. Stimulated by this kind of news, the market suddenly saw strong buying interest. The price of Category C, excluding the winning lottery, was even higher than before the holiday. If this situation is slightly confirmed, the market price will still have the possibility of soaring and finding a new high price. Yesterday, the opening began with big firms raising prices to buy, and the prices of each immediately rose by five or six jiao. Afterwards, No. 4, No. 7, Lianhe, Tongyu, Runli, and Tongkang all bought in. At that time, Renchang, Shunheng, Defu, Shuntai, and No. 22 were all selling, and No. 9 sold more. When the market closed, No. 20 suddenly had an appetite, and the market price became firm again. The morning rose by seven or eight jiao. After the afternoon opening, No. 20 continued to absorb, and Dafeng and Tiansheng both bought in. No. 41 also opened and closed. Lianhe and Yongkang sold slightly. No. 5 exited Category C and entered Category A. The market price was first firm and then flat, and the trend was quite good. In summary, the market prices all rose, ranging from six jiao and a half to eight jiao. The price of Category C rose by 1 jiao due to the rights of excluding the winning lottery. The total number of transactions was more than 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Buyers have the greatest need for exchange tickets. Buyers offered 39 yuan and 2 jiao and a half for the Shanghai Cotton Exchange stock, but there were still no sellers. The rest also tended to be firm.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association reported that during the past few holidays, there were various unfavorable rumors, and it was expected that the market price would fall sharply after the opening. However, this city saw stability. Compared with the stock markets in Europe and America, the US market fell even more, which is incomparable. Therefore, the stock holders in this port should be happy. Although the trading of various shares was not large, the prices were not much lower than before. However, Jardine Matheson and Wheelock stocks had good trading performance. The public bus stock fell sharply to 25 yuan and 5 jiao because the annual interest was only 7 jiao, which disappointed people. Although the interest paid was less, the company's annual profit was very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Rubber Raw Materials: Although New York telegraphed that sentiment was tight for spot conditions, rubber shares in this port continued to be scarce.</p>
<h3>Kodak Milk Dividend of One Yuan</h3>
<p>The local British-owned Kodak Milk Company announced yesterday that its 1938 profit was 85,673.65 yuan in national currency, including the 118,483.34 yuan in national currency carried over from 1937, totaling 202,56.99 yuan in national currency. After paying a dividend of 1 yuan per share, totaling 80,000 yuan, it will also allocate 10,000 yuan to the dividend equalization reserve, and 125,000 yuan to the statutory reserve, leaving a remaining 27,000 yuan to be carried over to the next term. The above distribution will be announced at the shareholders' meeting on the 21st of this month, and it will be paid out.</p>
<h3>Knock Lao Fo Shares Issues Dividends</h3>
<p>The board of directors of Knock Lao Fo Java Rubber Tree Co., Ltd., managed by Huitong Foreign Company in this port, decided yesterday to pay a dividend of 3 fen per share in national currency for 1938. The general meeting of shareholders for this term is also scheduled to be held on the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower Southern Procurement Continues Nonstop, Yarn Market Advances Circuitously, More Than 3,700 Packages Traded, Market Price Rises 5-8 Yuan, Each Factory Opens More Than 4,000 Packages</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to soar, with a stable momentum. Because during the several days of this port closure, customers still transacted more than 800 packages. In addition, the needs of the Hong Kong, Yunnan, and Shantou gangs continued non-stop, and sentiment remained high. The market price was promoted by this actual transaction, but a part of it loosened because the factories opened too many numbers, and sold when the price was high. The market situation was slightly stable in the middle. The future depends on customer sales to shift. The market sentiment in the afternoon was even tighter. Recently, there has been a lot of procurement from the South, and people have been particularly excited. The selling price became higher and higher. The Yunnan gang was eager to search for 10-count coarse yarn, so the price of group yarn rose even more.</p>
<p>Current Yarn Situation: At the beginning of the morning opening, the market was crowded because of the several days of the holiday. The market sentiment was stable, and the public opinion was optimistic about the market price. Indeed, the Hong Kong and Chaoshan gangs had entrusted goods to be purchased. Therefore, the atmosphere was tense, and the opening price was 2 yuan higher than before the closure. 20-count Double Horse was 389 yuan. The customer sales continued to be steady, and the market price was firm. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 390.05 yuan. By the time the market closed, sellers who made a profit sold, and it fell slightly by 1 yuan. In the afternoon, because the business was still prosperous, the market price rose again, with 20-count Double Horse yarn at 392 yuan, up another 1.5 yuan. According to statistics, various gangs bought a total of 2,705 packages. The market prices of 20-count Double Horse and Tiannv yarns both rose by 5-5.5 yuan, Double Earth rose by 5 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 3-8 yuan. The Xinyu factory opened 500 packages of 10-count Double Earth, priced at 303 yuan. The Shenxin factory opened 100 packages of 10-count Young Pioneers, priced at 309-310 yuan. The Hongzhang factory opened 200 packages of 10-count Bao Yi, priced at 300 yuan. British factories such as Jardine Matheson, Yigong, and Yangshupu opened 20-count Five Blessings, priced at 355 yuan, Shepherd, priced at 358 yuan. There were also 32-count Samsung, 42-count Samsung, 20-count Samsung, 6-count Rouge Tiger and other yarns totaling more than 4,000 packages. Today, 10 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 520 pieces were shipped to Shantou, and 55 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yunnan 1050 Wenzhou 50 Fellow Traders 990</p>
<p>Hong Kong 1050 Fuzhou 20 Shantou 320</p>
<p>Inland 45 Tianjin 175 Jiangxi 15</p>
<p>Quanzhou 10 Total 3715</p>
<p>Before the port closure, the Japanese yarn market was rising rapidly. It was said that the market would rise after the port opened, but the market price in the Qingdao Exchange suddenly fell, affecting the Shanghai market price. Therefore, many people came to sell, and the price fell step by step in the morning and rebounded slightly in the afternoon. As a result, the price of 20-count Water Moon was 355 yuan, and the price of Blue Phoenix was 350-349 yuan. The yarn price fell by 1.2 yuan from the price before the stop.</p>
<h3>Cotton Loan Issue Still Unannounced, U.S. Cotton Prices Expected to Fall – “Fire Machine Flower” Rises Another Half Dollar –</h3>
<p>The international cotton market in New York experienced a sharp drop in cotton prices due to the European political crisis and a plunge in New York securities. Yesterday, the market rebounded slightly due to some buying on Wall Street, but prices are still down four or five pounds compared to before the holiday. Washington has not yet announced any decisions regarding loans, but it is generally expected that an announcement will be made within days. While the details are unknown, there is no doubt that cotton prices will fall. Yesterday, the Indian cotton market fell two rupees compared to before the holiday, and Egyptian cotton also fell more than twenty pounds. The exchange rate yesterday was not much different from before the holiday. Converting to legal tender, cotton prices all fell, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton each falling thirty cents per picul, Indian cotton falling seventy cents, and Egyptian cotton falling one dollar and fifty cents.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, trading in foreign cotton has been brisk recently, especially in coarse yarn, with prices rising sharply. Coarse yarn is selling faster than fine yarn, and factories are finding it easier to profit from coarse yarn due to faster and higher output. Many factories have recently been increasing their production. However, the raw materials for spinning coarse and fine yarns, such as Tongzhou Yaohua cotton, are priced quite high, and transportation is inconvenient. Yaohua cotton can no longer be transported out, so factories are competing to buy Indian Pingguo cotton as a substitute. Yesterday, Rongfeng imported 1,000 bales of Pingguo cotton, and Anda imported 500 bales. The futures prices for yesterday, converted to delivery to the factory, are as follows:</p>
<p>Local cotton business is still conducted secretly as usual. Demand from all parties is flat. Only Hongzhang imported 108 pieces, just for show, and there was no other significant activity. Japanese factories are quiet. There is some trading in white-package cotton from the head of the dock among fellow traders, but market prices are rising along with yarn prices. Tongzhou cotton has risen half a dollar compared to before the closure, and "fire machine flower" has also risen several dimes. The situation for local cotton remains difficult. During the few days of closure, 720 bales of Tongzhou cotton from northern Jiangsu arrived, and yesterday 504 bales arrived. There were 100 bales of wooden-frame cotton (and 60 pieces from Qidong, with 30 pieces being shipped to Hong Kong today). The amount of spot cotton transacted yesterday and market conditions are listed below:</p>
<h3>Grey Cloth and Domestically-Produced Fabric Sales are Booming – Prices of Eastern Cloth are High, Dyeing Factories are Choosing Domestically-Produced Goods, Tens of Thousands of Pieces of Grey Cloth Futures are Ordered on this Street</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the selling price of domestically-produced cloth based on raw materials and yarn rose sharply. Cloth prices increased universally. All factories raised their opening prices. Colored cloth and colored twill rose by 20 to 40 cents per piece, and bleached cloth and bleached twill rose by nearly 21 and a half cents per piece. The increase in the price of various autumn grey cloths was especially dramatic. Tens of thousands of pieces were ordered on this street for the months of June, July, August, and September. Opening prices are steadily increasing, rising another 20 to 30 cents per piece compared to the previous week. White fine twill and fine cloth rose by 10 to 25 cents per piece. Dyeing factories on this street, due to the high prices of Eastern cloth, are gradually shifting their focus and selectively using domestically-produced goods. Trading is becoming more active, with over 100 bales of fine cloth and over 300 bales of fine twill being transacted. Coarse cloth sales are sluggish, and opening prices have not increased. Yihua Factory's light and heavy weights are all being sold at original prices, with only the 14-pound cloth rising by 5 cents per piece. New Yu’s 14-pound “Earth” brand is selling at a premium of 40 cents per piece due to a shortage of similar goods from competitors. The 9-pound coarse underclothing is rising by 35 cents per piece. The Hengfeng Factory’s 8-call underclothing grey cloth is rising by 20 cents per piece. Sales to remote southwestern provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangdong are the most active, with shipments continuing to be enthusiastic. Demand on this street is booming, with both seasonal goods and autumn grey cloths being in high demand. Merchants from Wenzhou are handling 40 to 50 bales of coarse cloth, with over 1,000 pieces being imported from Wenzhou to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth prices rose too sharply before the spring holiday, and the morning selling prices of fine cloth and fine twill were universally soft. Merchants from the north also withdrew and suspended operations, and the market atmosphere eased, with prices falling by about 10 cents per piece. Afterwards, because dyeing and sales on this street were still quite good, and fellow traders were firm in their intentions, futures trading continued at around 1,000 pieces yesterday, so opening prices in the afternoon rose again. The 12-pound "Colored Ball" fine cloth still requires 13.25 yuan, but the leading brands are relatively weak, selling for only 12.90 yuan. Fine twill has not changed much, and the trend remains strong.</p>
<p>Exports of finished cloth on the 12th included 14 pieces to Xiamen, 300 pieces to Shantou, and 160 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Woolen Cloth Sales</h3>
<p>The woolen cloth market remained firm yesterday, a Tuesday, with brisk trading in both retail and wholesale. Among sales to other regions, medium-to-long lengths are being taken, with Chengdu, Chongqing, Xufu, Jianshui, Jiading, Kunming, and other regions being slightly stronger. Sales to Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao are also acceptable. Wenzhou, Huangyan, Jinhua, and Fujian provinces have all temporarily halted after the fall of Nanchang. Merchants from Nanjing are still making purchases, while interest from Hangzhou is weaker than before. There is only sporadic trading in the guerrilla areas of Suzhou and Jiaxing. In general, other ports accessible by mail are still making purchases. Domestically-produced goods account for most of the sales, except in guerrilla areas. Western goods are also common. Even in Beijing and Tianjin, Western-style clothing materials are mostly Western goods.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea – Silk Prices are Rising Steadily</h3>
<p>Both domestic and international silk markets have been quite firm since reopening after the holiday. The New York Stock Exchange recently reported an increase of four cents for near-term deliveries and three cents for far-term deliveries. Yesterday's total trading volume reached 2,920 bales, which can be called a record high. The Yokohama silk market rose daily during this spring holiday, remaining extraordinarily firm. Yesterday, spot prices rose sharply by 20 yuan, and far-term prices rose by 9 yuan. Observing the overseas silk market, the phenomenon of "squeezing" on spot goods seems to continue.</p>
<p>Recently, the silk market in Shanghai has seen repeated transactions due to stable public sentiment before and after the spring holiday. The increase in prices in Japan and the US has not had a drastic impact, allowing the market to remain close to exports. According to silk industry insiders, since the Shanghai silk market has returned to normal, nearly 1,000 bales of Shanghai-produced foreign silk have been traded in the ten days before and after the spring holiday. The gradual recovery of silk prices by about 40 yuan is a very pleasing phenomenon. Yesterday, silk trading in Shanghai continued to expand. White factory 81, 20-22 denier stripe, priced at 1,650 yuan. 78, 20-22 denier stripe, priced at 1,620 yuan. Renji, Lianna, and other firms imported nearly 100 bales in total. The highest grades of Qilin and Running Horse silk from six companies in Ji'an are in high demand overseas, and silk trading is expected to expand further.</p>
<p>On the 11th, 118 pieces of silk were shipped to Europe, and 4 tons of tea were shipped to Marseille.</p>
<h3>Grain – Merchants from Southeast Asia are Making Healthy Purchases of Factory Flour – 3,000 Bags of Wheat Sold to the North</h3>
<p>Factory Flour: Yesterday was the first day of trading after the Qingming Festival holiday, and trading in factory spot flour seemed lively, but actual sales were not brisk. Merchants from northern China were trying to depress prices due to high remittance rates, while factories were reluctant to lower prices further, citing rising international reports and abundant Shanghai flour supplies. It is said that merchants from Southeast Asia were gradually becoming more active, with transactions exceeding 20,000 bags. The asking price for No. 2 flour was still 4.40 yuan, and the wholesale price on this street was the same, with nearly 10,000 bags being transacted. It is also reported that merchants from northern China contacted factories in the evening to negotiate wholesale transactions, with a proposal to depress the price by a few cents, but this has not been confirmed. According to news from merchants, over 100,000 bags have been shipped to Tianjin, Yantai, and other places during the holiday. If prices can be especially cheap, purchases will not be weak. It is reported that 75,000 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin today, and another 1,000 bags were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Yesterday, sales of foreign flour also became active. International production prices remain firm, and long-term orders are still uneconomical. Although new arrivals were during the holiday, local merchants continued to distribute them continuously, and transactions reached more than 100,000 bags. Merchants from northern China also bought a lot, and retail sales on this street were also lively. Because sales were still active, sellers were not eager to sell, so wholesale prices were relatively stable. Brands such as "Bat", "Double Eagle", and "Lamp" were all sold for 4.30 yuan by remittance, but the high-end brand "Red Sun" required 4.30 yuan cash, with prices varying depending on the brand.</p>
<p>Wheat: Newly arrived goods included 4,000 to 5,000 bags in small quantities from Nanjing and Jiangbei, including 3,000 bags from Xingang. It is also said that a foreign firm has several thousand bags arriving. Factories’ appetite remains sluggish, because the combined price of foreign wheat is cheaper than domestic wheat. In addition to orders arriving steadily, a new batch of Australian wheat has been ordered, totaling 7,500 tons, with delivery scheduled before the end of this month. Therefore, the demand for domestic wheat from factories is difficult to be enthusiastic. However, merchants still favor it. Merchants from the north purchased more than 3,000 bags of wheat from Jiangbei and Nanjing at a price of 7.13 yuan to 7 yuan, and the market remained firm. The wheat market, which had been stalled for many days, even opened its doors on the first day after the reopening.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales on this Street Declined</h3>
<p>Sources of community rice from various groups included 8 cars of "Wheelbarrow" and "Baozi" brands from He Xia, over 2,000 bags from the Su Tong group, 500 bags from the Kunshan group, and 250 bags from the Changzhou group. The general market situation, which turned soft the day before yesterday, saw a decline in sales on this street yesterday, and stockpilers’ appetite also weakened, resulting in a weary situation. As a result, the prices of both thick and thin japonica rice, except for high-grade goods, have depreciated slightly from the highs of the day before yesterday. The price of Du Yang Jian Bu Jian is quite good because of the scarcity of goods, and supply and demand are equal, with no difference.</p>
<p>Both merchants and stockpilers were sluggish yesterday for customer indica rice. The street selected high-quality rice for slight purchases. Therefore, although the high-quality indica rice from Wuhu opened at high prices of 13.40 yuan and 13.30 yuan, the market was extremely soft. Lowering the price by 5 to 6 cents still lacked buyers. The total number of transactions for the day was only over 1,000 bags. If the sales to customers are still sluggish today and tomorrow, then the selling price may have to be gradually lowered. Because of the ample inventory at present and the continuous source, most people in the market are downstream.</p>
<p>On the 12th, 400 bags of corn were shipped to Tianjin. The production price soared again by 7 yuan. According to the current purchase price in Shanghai, it should be in the range of 50 yuan, but it is not a particularly high-quality product. The import and export have already been reversed. 260 bags came from Shantou, and 370 bags came from Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes - High Prices for Raw Soybean Oil are Repeatedly Seen</h3>
<p>The issue of unified management of soybean oil is still unclear, and there is no way to compromise, leading to heightened public sentiment and new highs emerging one after another. More than 160 barrels of Dalian oil were opened, with the price starting at 41 yuan and gradually increasing sharply. As a result, the price was 42.50 yuan, an increase of 2.80 yuan from the previous day's market. 200 pieces of Yanqi oil were transacted at 31 yuan, an increase of 1.80 yuan. 200 dan of Dayou Factory oil were traded at 32.70 yuan, an increase of 1.70 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of raw oil followed in the footsteps of soybean oil, rising steadily and seeing new highs frequently, which is rare in recent years. It is estimated that 270 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were transacted yesterday, with prices ranging from 33.20 yuan to 34 yuan, an increase of 1.50 yuan from the previous market. 100 pieces were transacted in April for 32.50 yuan, an increase of 50 cents. 30 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded at 45 yuan, also an increase of 50 cents from the previous market. As a result, the retail price is 37 cents per catty for soybean oil and 40 cents per catty for raw oil.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods - Jianqu is Upside Down - Production Price Rises by Another 7 Yuan</h3>
<p>Fujian red yeast is made from rice. Because rice has been scarce in the area recently, there is even less red yeast for sale, and production prices have risen again and again. According to news from the Fuzhou merchants yesterday,</p>
<h3>Coal - Coal Ball Industry Establishes Agreement</h3>
<p>Due to competition among peers last month, the price of coal balls once plummeted. Now, through the mediation of the guild, a compromise has been reached. The price of Yitaixing and Nanyang's Zhengpai brand is 33 yuan per ton delivered to the same industry, and the price of the Vicepai brand is 29 yuan, plus 1 yuan for car force. The price of goods from small factories is reduced by 5 cents to 1 yuan. Each hundred catties sold to customers in the main stores are sold for 1.80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains - Lian Bean Futures - Slight Short Covering Transactions, Spot Market Prices Frequently Rise</h3>
<p>Spot trading in yellow soybeans has not been strong, but prices have been rising frequently under the shadow of the unified management issue. Yesterday, the price of each bean in the market continued to rise by 10 to 20 cents. It is estimated that more than 500 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow were purchased on this street, with prices rising from 8.80 yuan to 9.10 yuan. Four cars of Dalian beans were sold by Yuanfang, with prices of 9 yuan and 9.10 yuan. One car was transacted on this street, with the quoted price being 8.90 yuan. Because there is still no clear way to implement the rumored deal for Dalian to facilitate exports, a portion of the April futures beans were used to cover short positions. A total of 13 to 14 cars were traded, with prices of 8.60 yuan to 8.70 yuan, an increase of 14 cents compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>11.5 tons of beans were shipped to Columbus on the 11th, and 90 bags of sesame seeds came from Qidong.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items Egg Yolk and Egg White Shipped to England in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Egg yolk and egg white are a major export from China. Since being hit by the war, exports have gradually decreased. On the 11th of this month, 620 tons of egg yolk and egg white were shipped to London. On the Shanghai side, 2,420 fresh eggs were shipped from Xingang.</p>
<p>Correction: The two types of shark fins, "Quan Gou" and "Wu Gou," mentioned in yesterday's casual chat are both Japanese goods, mistakenly classified as Western goods. "Quan Gou" was mistaken for "Jin Gou." The correction should be made.</p>

<h3>Detained Ships Have Entered Port – Passengers Completely Released – Portuguese Consul Visits Miura to Protest – Imported Ships Still Under Surveillance – Shipping Companies Exert All Efforts to Maintain the Shanghai-Wenzhou Route –</h3>
<p>After Japanese warships detained Portuguese merchant ships in the waters off eastern Zhejiang, the Portuguese consul protested to the Japanese consul yesterday. The detained ships have now entered the port and are docked at the Yangshupu buoys, still under surveillance by Japanese soldiers. However, the passengers have been completely released, and the Shanghai-Wenzhou route is operating as usual. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Detained Ships Sail into Wusong: The detained ships, under the surveillance of Japanese warships, sailed from the waters off eastern Zhejiang to the outer port of Wusong and anchored. The Portuguese Zhengde Company’s Li Bao wheel had already entered the port on the afternoon of the 9th and docked at buoy No. 18 in Yangshupu. Today, the American Huamei Company’s Tang Qiao, Tang Bei, Tang Lu, the Portuguese Meili Company’s Mei Da, the Portuguese Atlantic Company’s Hai Long, and the Portuguese Wanguo Company’s Lu De and Bao De were all notified by the Japanese Navy to sail into the port of Wusong yesterday and dock at buoys No. 16, 17, and 18 in Yangshupu, together with the Li Bao wheel that entered on the 9th and the Greek Livormo wheel that was previously detained.</p>
<p>Passengers Released and Transported Ashore: Although the ships had sailed into the port of Wusong and docked at the Yangshupu buoys, each ship was still guarded by soldiers sent by the Japanese warships, who were monitoring the actions of the ships. Radio operators had all lost their freedom. As for the passengers on each ship, yesterday the Japanese warships sent tugs and small motorboats to transport the passengers and luggage from Mei Da, Tang Bei, Tang Qiao, Tang Lu, Hai Long, and other ships to the New Customs Wharf and landed them. However, the crew remained on board the ships, and cargo was not allowed to be unloaded. Furthermore, the Lu De and Bao De wheels are deck ships mainly used to carry cargo, so there were no passengers on this trip to Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Reasons Given by the Japanese Navy: At a reception for foreign journalists the day before yesterday, a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy authorities said that the detention of ships flying the Portuguese flag was currently under investigation to determine the truth. They deeply believe that the owners of the detained ships are still Chinese merchants, and that foreigners are only collecting flag commission fees. Furthermore, some ships are actually supplying Chinese guerrillas. The Portuguese Consul-General has not yet filed a protest with the consulate, but he did visit the consulate regarding the detention of the ships. It is reported that the Portuguese Consul believes the Japanese Navy spokesperson’s statement is unfounded and inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>Portuguese Consul Visits Miura to Protest: After receiving reports from shipping companies regarding the detention of Portuguese merchant ships by Japanese warships, the Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai, Alves, immediately negotiated with the Japanese Consul and Naval authorities in Shanghai. Due to the spring holiday, no results were obtained for several days. Yesterday, with the end of the spring holiday, work resumed, and at 11:00 a.m., he visited Consul-General Miura at the Japanese Consulate and lodged a strong protest, demanding the immediate release of the ships and presenting evidence proving that the ships were indeed owned by Portuguese merchants. It is reported that the Japanese side has agreed to release the passengers first and said that the nationality of the ships has been investigated, resulting in no satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>Request to Allow Chartered Ships to Sail: The Dinghai Shanghai Hometown Association, in view of the detention of the Li Bao wheel sailing on the Dinghai-Ningbo line at Zhushanmen, which was delayed along the way for four days, and which has now been forced to come to Shanghai, with all passengers being from the same hometown and with their travel expenses exhausted due to the unexpected detention, plans to charter foreign ships to take them back to their native Dinghai. Those who wish to go to Dinghai are asked to contact the association for registration starting immediately. In addition, the Li Bao wheel authorities have chartered the German Luxin Shipping Company’s Gaodeng wheel to come from Dinghai to Shanghai to load the stranded passengers back to Dinghai. It is reported that the Gaodeng wheel is currently docked in Dinghai and has not yet sailed to Shanghai. Because Dinghai is a restricted port, they are currently seeking approval from the Ningbo Garrison Commander.</p>
<p>Passengers on Each Ship Undergo a Great Shock: Yesterday, the New Voice News reporter met a passenger on the Tang Lu wheel, who said that after the Japanese warships detained the ships, they sent Japanese soldiers to board the ships for inspection. It was not until today that they were allowed to land. The passengers on each ship have all undergone a great shock. In addition to confirming the Tang Bei, Tang Lu, Tang Qiao, Hai Long, Mei Da, Li Bao, and deck ships Lu De and Bao De, there is also one deck ship whose name has not been identified. However, according to shipping company news, it is a Belgian ship and not one sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. As for the Portuguese Far East Company’s deck ship Da Mao, it has been confirmed that it has not been detained.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Exert All Efforts to Maintain Navigation: Since the Portuguese merchant ships were detained, the Portuguese ships Mei Fa, Tang Sai, and Shantai have all postponed their voyages. However, German and Italian ships are operating the Shanghai-Wenzhou line as usual. (1) The German Luxin Shipping Company’s Feikang wheel is scheduled to clear customs today and sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou tomorrow morning. (2) The Italian Yihua Shipping Company’s Baoli wheel is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou tomorrow. (3) The German Lihe Shipping Company’s Haifu wheel is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the morning of the 15th.</p>

Fan Jietang from the National Debt Fund Management Committee, Pei Yunqing from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Hu Xian from the Banking Association, Ba Dayou from the Money Industry Association, Ju Zhijing from the First Special District Court, Wang Lin from the Central Bank, Tang Yusun from the Bank of China, Fan Chuchen from the Bank of Communications, and over twenty others attended.

<h3>Japanese Army Intensifies Security – It is Rumored that Wusong will be Closed to Shipping – Guerrilla Warfare West of Baoshan is Extremely Active – Over 40 Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded in Liuhuo</h3>
<p>Guerrilla forces in areas west of Baoshan, such as Luodian and Jiading, are said to be quite active. Recently, guerrilla forces have been discovered in various rural areas of Baoshan, Wusong, and Dachang. Due to the small number of stationed Japanese troops in these areas, special security measures have been implemented to prevent ambushes by guerrilla forces that may appear or disappear at any time. Regardless of whether they are male or female villagers, they must carry a pass to enter and exit, and they are also subject to strict searches. A few days ago, five rural women who went to the town from Yangxing were searched by Japanese soldiers and female inspectors stationed at the town entrance. One of the women had a box cannon hidden in her crotch, and another woman had 20 bullets hidden in the back of her cotton jacket. Both were discovered. The Japanese soldiers believed that the two women were transporting weapons for the guerrilla forces, so they transferred all five rural women to the Japanese military police headquarters for detention. The next day, in Wusong Township, three rural women were also detained by Japanese soldiers after being inspected, because they were believed to be transporting weapons for the guerrilla forces, and they have not been released to this day. As a result, there is talk of closing Wusong to shipping, and residents are greatly alarmed.</p>
<p>Xu Hongfa Moves Out of Chuansha City</p>
<p>Xu Hongfa’s followers, who were initially stationed in Chuansha City, were later forced to leave because their subordinates were treacherous and plundered at will, making life unbearable for the merchants and residents of the city. They specially devised a plan to persuade him to leave. Xu also knew that public anger was difficult to overcome and that he could not stay for long, so he moved to Shenjiazai. Near the 7th of this month, he moved his office to a residence at Panjiaqiao, outside the south gate of Chuansha, forcibly occupying a larger house and deploying his followers around the Kong family residence, Wei family residence, Wang family residence, He family residence, and Zhang family residence to prevent accidents. Local residents dare to be angry but dare not speak out, fearing that if he does not leave, they will inevitably suffer. It is reported that the guerrilla forces are also waiting patiently for an opportunity to launch a major attack.</p>
<p>Ambush on the Shanghai-Taicang Road</p>
<p>Tangqiao Town, located on the Shanghai-Taicang Road north of Dachang in western Shanghai, has always been the defense area of the ×th team of the Border Area People’s Self-Defense Force, with a total of three companies stationed there. On the morning of the 9th of this month, they had an ambush with the enemy. After about an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and sent in a large number of reinforcements. The three companies also cooperated with each other, attacking from the front and responding from the rear, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. They immediately captured five enemy soldiers, seized some weapons, and left swiftly.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers in Liuhuo Discard Weapons and Flee</p>
<p>The guerrilla forces in Liuhuo, led by Commander-in-Chief Fan ××, launched a night attack on the Japanese army last night (the 10th), surrounding the Japanese army headquarters, attacking from three sides. The Japanese army resisted upon hearing the alarm, but their retreat was cut off, so they desperately tried to break out, attempting to escape eastward. The guerrilla forces immediately tracked them down and killed them. The Japanese army lost their fighting spirit and discarded their weapons, fleeing in all directions. In this battle, over 40 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and the guerrilla forces only suffered one wounded warrior, capturing over 20 guns.</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops Suddenly Impose Martial Law in Pudong</p>
<p>Starting yesterday (the 10th), the Japanese and puppet troops in Pudong suddenly imposed martial law again, densely deploying posts along the riverbanks, stacking obstacles in the streets and key passes, creating a tense situation. According to investigations from various sources, it has become clear that the Japanese army received a secret report a few days ago, claiming that plainclothes teams would attack Pudong and eliminate the Japanese and puppet troops. Therefore, the Japanese side took this panicked action.</p>
<p>Japanese Build Pillboxes in 63rd Flower Garden</p>
<p>The Japanese army is building two small pillboxes on the side of the 63rd Flower Garden at the end of North Sichuan Road, one controlling Jiangwan and Wusong to the east, and the other controlling the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to the west. Construction has now begun, and it will take three months to complete. Over 100 Japanese engineers are currently supervising dozens of Chinese coolies, working day and night to rush the construction.</p>
<h3>Yu Zhifei Abandons His Post to Join the Army</h3>
<p>Yu, formerly an employee of a weaving factory, has now joined the anti-Japanese army in the suburbs of Shanghai. Yu Zhifei, a worker at the Renhe Weaving Factory in the French Concession of this city, is 20 years old and hails from Kunshan County. He started as an apprentice at the factory and was exceptionally diligent in his duties. He was loyal and appropriate in his dealings with others. The factory authorities highly valued him. He had only been at the factory for a little over two years, and before his apprenticeship was even complete, he was promoted to employee. He was entrusted with important responsibilities and given a particularly generous salary. His colleagues in the factory also enjoyed being around him. He was truly a promising young man. Since the outbreak of the war, he has been deeply stimulated in spirit and has repeatedly expressed to others his desire to join the fight against the enemy. Those who heard him all thought it was just a joke and did not expect him to actually do it. Unexpectedly, two nights ago, he suddenly left the factory without saying where he was going. Last night, his colleagues at the factory received a letter from him, stating that he had gone to join the anti-Japanese army in the suburbs of Shanghai. His colleague, Chang, immediately informed his cousin, Qian Zhenwan, by telephone. Yu's entry into the factory was through Qian's introduction. Although Qian approves of his service to the country, he is concerned that there are still outstanding procedures at the factory. He is currently trying to find him and hopes that he will quickly send a letter explaining everything so that he can go and take care of it on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang West Cargo Ships Cease Coming to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign merchant Delai Tugboat Company towed eight rice and cargo ships to Shanghai south of the blockade line at Yulai Temple on the upper reaches of the Huangpu River. It is reported that the original plan was to tow more than twenty ships in total. Now, because the Chinese army in western Zhejiang has rectified measures for the main food and goods, and temporarily prohibited exports, twenty more rice ships have ceased coming to Shanghai. It is heard that in the future, Shanghai merchants going to western Zhejiang to purchase goods must have a legal purchasing permit to avoid aiding the enemy. On the one hand, it can also maintain the livelihood and safety of the people in the newly controlled areas of the Chinese army.</p>
<h3>Far East British Ships Install Armed Equipment Handled by Hong Kong and Kowloon Dockyards to Prepare for Wartime Needs</h3>
<p>The British government, in preparation for wartime needs, has ordered the installation of armed equipment on merchant ships of that country. Merchant ships sailing on the Far East routes are being equipped by the Hong Kong and Kowloon dockyards. Most are equipped with four-inch caliber gun positions. Some ships that have to undertake transportation in combat zones are equipped with equipment that can withstand the power of four-inch caliber guns, such as the installation of steel plates. Shipyards in Singapore, Australia, and other places have also received instructions from the British government to undertake this modification and armament project.</p>

<h3>3,000 Jewish Refugees to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month Half Arriving on German Ships, Each Forced to Pay 2,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that yesterday evening (the 10th), it was learned from those in charge that more than 3,000 Jewish refugees from Europe are expected to arrive in Shanghai next month. About 1,500 of them will arrive on two German ships specifically transporting them. It is expected that the remaining 1,600 to 1,800 people will disembark here on the Italian mail ship "Cesare," which is sailing to Shanghai for the first time. Almost all of the refugees on the two German ships were expelled by the National Socialist Party police. According to news from this city, they were all forced to pay a shipping fee of 2,000 yuan before being allowed to board the ships. To avoid the foreign exchange that would be required to transit the Suez Canal, the two German ships will take the route around the Cape of Good Hope to Shanghai. The refugees on the Italian ship are from other parts of Central Europe and Germany. The total number of German Jewish refugees in Shanghai has already exceeded 5,000, but when the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde" arrives in Shanghai on April 25, it will carry about 600 more men, women, and children. According to sources in charge, by the end of this year, there will be at least 8,000 Jews in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Kuling Library Has Been Bombed</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported yesterday (the 10th) that shortly after 34 foreigners withdrew from Kuling in late February, the Chinese library opposite the Kuling American School was hit by bombs dropped by Japanese planes. This matter has now been almost confirmed. It is heard that the foreigners staying on the mountain now feel that Japanese planes will not bomb that part of Kuling again. The Japanese side has allowed that they will no longer carry out indiscriminate bombing within the foreign property industry line in Kuling and seem to be keeping their promise. Since the indiscriminate bombing mentioned by the foreigners who evacuated to Shanghai on February 27, Japanese planes have dropped bombs outside the limits of the foreign property industry. It is heard that those previously bombed included the Bank of China, a certain German building, a Catholic church, and the residence of Mr. Tev, whose residence was located at the boundary between the foreign property and the Chinese area.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Police Bureau Secretary Chief" Xi Shitai Shot Dead Chinese Police and Pedestrians Hit and Injured The Strong Man Calmly Evaded After the Incident</h3>
<p>At 9:15 yesterday morning, a shooting occurred on Lloyd Road in the Public Concession, targeting Xi Shitai, the secretary chief of the puppet municipal police bureau. Xi was shot several times and died soon after. Stray bullets injured a Chinese police officer, No. 730, and a pedestrian named Peng Fulin. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Appointed to a False Position Xi Shitai was from Dongting Mountain, Jiangsu, and was 49 years old. He lived at No. 12, Juyi Lane, Lloyd Road. He studied in Japan in his early years and graduated from Tokyo Medical University. After returning to China, he practiced medicine in Shanghai and opened the Shitai Medical Clinic. He had three wives at home, the second of whom was Japanese, whom Xi met during his studies in Japan. He had two sons and three daughters. He had been practicing medicine for many years and could have barely maintained a comfortable life. After the retreat of the National Army from the west, Xi became restless and went to serve as the secretary chief of the puppet police bureau. Since then, he has had a new car, license plate number 3172. Xi's eldest son, Xingzhi, also serves as the director of a certain radio station established by a certain party, specializing in broadcasting bizarre news.</p>
<p>Strong Man Sniper At 9:15 yesterday morning, Xi left his residence at No. 12, Juyi Lane. The south alley of the lane is usually not open, so Xi entered and exited through the back door when he went out. Unexpectedly, after walking a few steps, two strong men suddenly appeared, one wearing a long gown and the other wearing short clothes. Each took out a Mauser pistol, and one of them immediately shot Xi, firing five or six shots. All the bullets hit Xi's head and chest. The other strong man monitored Song Jiangrong, the No. 177 informant of the lane. After Xi was seriously injured, he fell to the ground bleeding.</p>
<p>Chinese Police Hit by Bullets At that time, Chinese police officer No. 730 from the Laozha Police Station happened to be passing by. Upon hearing the gunshots, he bravely entered the alley and blew his whistle. Seeing him rush over, the strong man immediately shot at the Chinese police officer. Both sides fired five or six shots. Subsequently, Chinese police officer No. 730 was hit by a bullet in the chest and immediately fell to the ground. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the two strong men immediately ran out of the alley and calmly evaded to other places.</p>
<p>Died Midway Subsequently, the Laozha Police Station received a report and immediately dispatched police cars and detectives to the scene of the incident. They sent the injured Chinese police officer and the dying Xi Shitai to the police hospital. However, because the bullets hit vital parts, Xi died on the way. The police station then sent Xi to the coroner's office and reported to the court for inspection. The injured Chinese police officer is expected to be saved after being admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>Pedestrians Affected As a result of the mutual shooting, a pedestrian named Peng Fulin, from Liyang, aged 23, was also hit in the left breast by a stray bullet. The bullet exited from the back. After Peng was injured, he was escorted to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The police station sent two Chinese police officers to guard him. It is reported that Peng's residence is at No. 11, Wenxian Lane, Lafayette Road. After being admitted to the hospital, his condition was quite serious, so as of last night, his life was still in danger. Yesterday afternoon, several people from a certain party went to the hospital to investigate everything in detail.</p>

<p>Polish Minister Expresses Military and Civilians Unite to Defend Against Aggression Always Prepared to Resist Aggression Encourages Polish Overseas Compatriots to Maintain Their Patriotic Spirit</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that more than 150 members of the Polish Youth Federation held a tea dance party at the Youth Association last night (the 10th). Baron Weidensey, the Polish Minister to China, also attended the meeting. Komasrowski, the president of the Shanghai branch of the Polish Youth Federation, spoke at the meeting, saying that Poland is currently facing great danger. Mr. Wei then rose to speak, saying that he was not prepared to give a speech, but he intended to correct what Mr. Ke said about Poland facing great danger. Mr. Wei then expressed the opposite view, saying, "I really don't think Poland is facing any danger today. On the contrary, although there are doubters today, Poland is still in a normal situation. Although there are currently negotiations on Danzig and the so-called corridor, there is no real danger to Poland. If there is any need to resist aggression to defend its borders, Poland is always prepared. Its military and civilians are confident that they will do their best to defend every inch of its territory. Although the newspaper yesterday published news that Germany may resort to force to make Poland accept its demands, we don't need to panic or fear." Mr. Wei finally expressed his gratitude to the Polish Youth Federation for inviting him to attend the meeting and expressed his pleasure that the younger Polish overseas compatriots and the older ones jointly maintained their loyalty and patriotism. Earlier, President Ke gave a brief speech at the beginning of the tea dance party, welcoming all the participants and urging the young people present not to forget the serious dangers Poland is currently facing so that they can fully understand their responsibility to protect the country when necessary. Father Steticsiak, who recently came to Shanghai from Poland, also spoke at the meeting, saying that the existence of the Polish Youth Federation in this city is a healthy sign of Poland's reunification and strength in the past 125 years, which is deeply gratifying.</p>
<h3>Hai Ge Road Mansion Rumored to Still Be Opening a Gambling House Obstacles Erected Expected to Cause Repercussions Also Said to Be Operating in the "Avenue" Area</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the house at No. 448 Hai Ge Road is rumored to be used to open a luxurious gambling house, so on Saturdays and Sundays, wire mesh barriers were erected outside the wall of the house along the Public Concession. There are still 24 Chinese workers inside repairing and decorating. The house has no other way to enter except for the main gate facing Hai Ge Road, which has already been blocked. Since Saturday, police have been waiting in front of it. According to yesterday's (10th) proof, no one has entered the house. Many believe that a large amount of food is stored in it. Yesterday, according to police sources, the workers in the house can leave the house at any time, but they are not allowed to re-enter through the main gate of Hai Ge Road. Yesterday, it was also learned that several people, either Koreans, Taiwanese, or Japanese, are still in the house. The police have not yet confirmed who the tenant of the house is. It is heard that these people have invested 60,000 Chinese yuan to renovate this red-walled building. The exterior is newly built with granite, and it is heard that the interior is currently being greatly renovated to meet the needs of the gambling house. In view of the huge investment, many expect that there will be repercussions after the police department erected obstacles outside the main gate and wall of the Hai Ge Road. If the investors intend to operate a gambling house, they will lose their investment if they are prevented from doing so before it even starts. However, some say that their investment may not be completely lost, because in the current housing situation in Shanghai, the house can easily be sold. Yesterday, according to informed sources, it is believed that the investors have spent a lot of money to operate a gambling house, and they must have some kind of guarantee, so it is expected that the action of erecting obstacles by a certain daily bureau will cause disputes. However, yesterday, according to informal sources, the relevant Japanese authorities and the Municipal Council Police Department have reached an agreement that the Japanese authorities will allow gambling dens to operate within the "Avenue" area and will not allow gambling dens that can be directly connected to roads outside the boundary to operate.</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Investigates Foreign Property in Coastal Zhejiang and Fujian Report Must Be Submitted Today or They Will Not Be Responsible</h3>
<p>Regarding the fact that Consul General White recently notified the German and Italian consulates to investigate the property of third countries along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, a reporter from Xiandai She was the first to report it. However, due to the Spring Festival holiday, the consulate was closed, so the original text could not be recorded. Only yesterday was the original text obtained, and it is translated as follows: (Omitted above) According to reports from the naval and air force authorities, recently, all properties with the flags and markings of third countries have been increasing in various places along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian. These markings are quite questionable. Therefore, in order to clarify the truth, please inform the merchants of your country that all properties in the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian should be listed on a notification form and sent to the Consulate General for transmission to the Japanese Military Bureau by April 12, 1939 (Wednesday) for attention. Otherwise, the Japanese side believes that the property marked with the third country's flag contains suspicious points and will be confirmed as the property of the Chinese people and will be used as an attack target. If any damage occurs as a result, the Japanese side will not be responsible. According to the above notice, it was only sent to the consulates of Germany and Italy in Shanghai. The United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries have not received the notice.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Spiritual Mobilization from Various Public Groups in This City Broad Mobilization of the Entire Nation All Sectors Should Form National Monthly Meetings Local Work Still Requires Effort</h3>
<p>Since the Central Government issued the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters has been actively promoting the propaganda movement by leading all sectors of society. The Shanghai All-Circles Spiritual Mobilization Headquarters has also been established. We support the Party Headquarters and the Headquarters to lead us with 120,000 points of sincerity and enthusiasm. At the same time, we also express our opinions on the promotion of spiritual mobilization work. Every member of our various national salvation groups must, under the leadership of the Party Headquarters and the Headquarters, regard this movement as the center of our work and develop local work in coordination with this central work. Our opinions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) We believe that the War of Resistance is entering a new and more difficult stage. Chairman Chiang has already indicated to us that in this new stage, politics is more important than military affairs. The introduction to the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline also clearly points out that in this new stage, "the difficulties that our people need to overcome through tempering and struggling are also increasing day by day compared with the previous stage. The enemy now knows that military power is not enough to subdue us and achieve their goals, so their recent plan is to shake our will and threaten our spirit in various ways." What we mean by politics being more important than military affairs refers to the development of the work itself, but the purpose of our work must be military affairs first and victory first.</p>
<p>(2) Therefore, our national spiritual mobilization is actually a broad political mobilization of the entire nation. The first thing here is a broad ideological mobilization. In order to overcome all the difficulties in the current stage of the War of Resistance, defeat the enemy's tricks, and persist in the War of Resistance until the final victory, we must strengthen the people's will, strengthen the people's confidence in the final victory, refute all the wavering and compromise ideas of traitors and pro-Japanese factions, and establish a sound and correct ideological system. This is also what the Mobilization Outline says: "What should be devoted to today is to focus on the revitalization and concentration of the spirit." In other words, we should base ourselves on the three major principles of "nation first, people first, military first, victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength" to combat all traitorous ideas that betray the nation and destroy military victory, shake will, and disperse strength, and promote the revolutionary spirit of the Three People's Principles.</p>
<p>(3) Because the National Spiritual Mobilization is aimed at the enemy's and traitors' conspiracy of political offensive, the enemy and traitors will inevitably try every means to sabotage our spiritual mobilization. For example, they can use the principles of "nation first, nation first, will concentrate, and ideological concentration" to justify correcting divergent and complicated ideas, to provoke the emotions between various parties, classes, and even groups within the national united front, and cause mutual friction and annexation. But we should point out that the so-called nation first and nation first are precisely aimed at the conspiracy of the enemy and traitors and are precisely to oppose the conspirators who split the country, the nation, and destroy the united front, and cannot be interpreted as restricting people's groups and repelling a certain party. The so-called correcting divergent and complicated ideas refers precisely to the ideas of traitors and compromisers, and cannot be distorted to mean restricting people's freedom of thought and belief and canceling people's freedom of speech and publication. Under the premise of not violating the revolutionary spirit of the Three People's Principles and not destroying the united front and hindering the War of Resistance, not only should they not be restricted, but they should also be guaranteed and promoted to allow each party, class, and group to exist and develop, so that each can contribute its best efforts to the War of Resistance. Not only should they not be banned, but also various opinions and various theories should be encouraged to discuss and learn from each other in order to collect ideas and broaden the benefits.</p>
<p>(4) However, the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement is by no means just an ideological mobilization. At the same time, it is also a broad organizational work of the entire nation. Correct revolutionary ideas, once accepted by the broad masses, become a great force. But this force must be organized and trained before it can be given a high degree of development and give the enemy a fatal blow. This is also clearly pointed out in the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline: "To mobilize the spirit of the national people to enrich the national strength of the War of Resistance, it is not only about mobilization, but also about organization. It is necessary to use the spirit of organization to develop the human resources of organization and use the materials of organization to adapt to the current needs of the country."</p>

<h3>The Liddell Ballroom Riot the Other Night: Soldiers from Four Nations in a Vicious Brawl, Italian Soldiers Start Trouble with a British Soldier; British, French, and American Soldiers Join Forces; Many Soldiers and Bar Girls Injured</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reports that, before midnight last night (the 10th), in the Liddell Ballroom (LittloClub) in Jing'an Temple, Italian Marine Corps soldiers attacked a soldier from the British Seaforth Highlanders. About 35 to 40 Italian sailors then engaged in a vicious fight with a smaller number of British, French, and American soldiers and sailors. As a result, the interior of the ballroom was completely destroyed, and two Russian bar girls were injured, one of whom suffered a serious head injury and had to be taken to the hospital. Three French sailors also sustained severe head injuries. Several Seaforth Highlanders soldiers and British and American sailors suffered minor injuries, mostly from being hit by bottles. The Italian sailors, being greater in number, had the upper hand in the fight, but it was reported that three of them were punched and temporarily knocked unconscious. When Italian officers arrived in a military truck and took the Italian soldiers back to their barracks, the fighting stopped. Several bar girls, with blood-stained clothes, were seen running out of the ballroom screaming, revealing that a fight had broken out inside. Other bar girls who could not escape hid in the back kitchens until the fighting subsided, after which they emerged. A Shanghai Evening Post reporter arrived at the scene a few minutes after the brawl and saw Italian officers ordering sailors to board a large truck parked at the entrance, which was quickly filled and driven away. The interior of the Liddell Ballroom was in a state of ruin, with tables, chairs, and doors mostly damaged, and broken bottles and glass shards scattered all over the floor. According to an eyewitness who answered the reporter's questions, the incident began shortly before midnight when a large group of Italian sailors entered the Liddell Ballroom and one of them accidentally bumped into a Highlanders soldier sitting alone near the entrance. Another Italian soldier immediately picked up a bottle and struck the British soldier, causing a severe cut above his right eye. Two French sailors sitting nearby, along with two British and two American sailors, went over to confront the Italian soldiers, which triggered the fight. The Italian sailors, along with other Italian sailors who had arrived at the Liddell Ballroom earlier, grabbed nearby tables, chairs, and bottles and began to smash things. Other Italian soldiers fought with the British, French, and American sailors. Fortunately, several British non-commissioned officers were also in the ballroom and, seeing that the British soldiers were outnumbered, escorted them into the kitchen. Meanwhile, several Chinese and Russian bar girls sitting around the dance floor were slightly injured by flying bottles or chairs before they could escape to safety, and some fainted and were carried into the kitchen by other bar girls or British and American sailors. As the brawl intensified, the ballroom owner called the commander of the Italian San Marco unit for help. Soon after, a truck commanded by a senior Italian officer sped to the scene, stopped the Italian soldiers in the ballroom, and took them back to their barracks. According to investigations, three French sailors sustained serious facial injuries and were taken back to their barracks. Although British and American sailors all suffered cuts, their injuries were not severe. One bar girl was taken to the Country Hospital; her injuries are reportedly not life-threatening.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed gentlemen of the Shen Bao Newspaper Office: We have just read a news item in the news column of your newspaper on April 11 regarding a salesman from the Sincere Cosmetics Factory embezzling funds. We were very surprised to learn of this. Upon investigation, our factory has no one named Meng Daiyuan, and none of our staff members are surnamed Meng. As for the claim in your newspaper that the staff member was highly trusted by the factory's director, Mr. Xu Zhaohe, our factory's director is also not Mr. Xu Zhaohe. We believe that your reporter mistakenly printed the name of another factory as Sincere Cosmetics Factory, hence the error. We are hereby sending this letter to request a correction. With best wishes, Sincere Cosmetics Factory, April 11th.</p>

<h3>Mosquitoes Are More Ferocious Than Tigers</h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>Mosquitoes are harmful to humans because they can cause malaria and yellow fever. Countries with developed cultures in the world pay the most attention to this, making every effort to prevent it. Soldiers on the front lines of the Anti-Japanese War in our country suffer greatly from malaria, which hinders their combat effectiveness. This is something that the government and patriotic medical experts should correct and remedy. According to reports, more than 100 million people in India suffer from mosquitoes every year, and the government's annual loss is 8 million pounds. However, this only refers to the government's tax revenue, and the economic losses of the people themselves are not included in this calculation. What is even more noteworthy is that about 50 people in Siam are eaten by tigers in a year, while more than 50,000 people are bitten by mosquitoes and die from malaria. Under the government's efforts to prevent it, it is still like this. If the government and society do not pay attention and let it go, the magnitude of the harm can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Simple Wind Tests</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhi</p>
<p>Wind is the most elusive thing. There is a saying "catching wind and grasping shadows," which is used to describe something illusory. However, wind is actually the easiest thing for humans to feel and has a very close relationship with human life and all flora and fauna. The greatest function of wind can be said to be the transmission of water vapor. Simply put, it is to transfer the water vapor evaporated from the surface of the ocean to the land. The second is to regulate the climate, so that the temperature on the ground is not too cold or too warm in various places. From a biological point of view, wind can help plants spread their seeds, which is what is called wind pollination. The miracle of wind is such that it is no wonder that ancient China thought that there was a "Wind God" to manage it!</p>
<p>In fact, the reason for wind is nothing more than the turbulence of the atmosphere. Why does the atmosphere need to be turbulent? That is because the heat of solar radiation causes the temperature on the ground to be different in different places, resulting in pressure differences. In addition, the Earth's rotation also has a considerable impact. Wind sometimes blows in only one direction, becoming a natural driving force for water navigation, which humans have long used. It can also be used to drive windmills for water pumping, grinding flour, and other work, which has also brought a lot of benefits to mankind. Another kind of strong cyclone, although it cannot be used, greatly threatens the safety of buildings, so engineers must know the situation of the wind before they can engage in design. In recent years, the aviation industry has developed, so not only the wind on the ground is of great importance, but also the wind in the high altitude cannot be ignored, because the wind in the high altitude is different from the wind on the ground.</p>
<p>Wind direction testing can generally be divided into (1) wind direction and (2) wind speed. Wind direction refers to the direction from which the wind is blowing. Usually, in cities or towns, there are fixed targets as a reference, and it is easy to see the movement of flags or smoke to determine it. Moreover, not only can the four directions of east, south, west, and north be used, but often southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest can be added to distinguish more accurately with eight directions. However, in the wilderness, it is inevitable that there will be some difficulties, so it is best to have a weather vane or a special flag for testing. However, the direction of the wind is not stable on a straight line. The so-called direction is only the average situation.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the wind refers entirely to the wind speed and has nothing to do with the wind direction. A large wind means that the speed of the wind is fast, or the pressure of the wind on an area is large. The pressure of the wind is directly proportional to the square of the wind speed, but it is not very accurate. For the safety of buildings, the magnitude of wind pressure or the speed of wind is the most important. It is more difficult to test the wind pressure. Usually, the wind speed is tested first, and then the wind pressure is calculated. There are many instruments for testing wind speed, and the details are extremely complicated, so I cannot describe them all here.</p>
<p>Now I will introduce a simple method of wind speed testing, called the Beaufort wind scale, which is listed in the table below. In the table, the magnitude of the wind is divided into thirteen levels, each level has a name, which is determined by the Central Meteorological Research Institute with reference to the original text. Beaufort was originally a nautical expert. Based on his experience, he distinguished the magnitude of the wind by the phenomena that occurred on land (there are other standards at sea), so the wind level can be determined without instruments. This testing method has long been adopted internationally, so it is often seen in the weather reports issued by the Xu Jiahui Observatory in our country, but only the level number is used without mentioning the name. The table also lists the corresponding wind speed (miles per hour) of each wind level, and other units can be calculated accordingly.</p>

<h3>Gas-Filled Light Bulbs</h3>
<p>— Xin Jun</p>
<p>Since Edison invented the carbon filament light bulb in 1879, many people have continued to work hard to study how to improve the filament in the bulb, hoping to find a more durable filament. As a result, tungsten filament was found. Tungsten is also a metal, like gold, silver, copper, and iron, but people don't know much about it because it is very similar to tin. Dr. Coolidge of General Electric invented a new method of refining tungsten. Some people thought that the light bulb manufacturing industry had reached its peak. However, there are still various difficult problems that cannot be completely solved. For example, there is still a need to save electricity, and the bulb starts to turn black after it is used, and the light slowly decreases. Therefore, tungsten filament bulbs are indeed not very satisfactory. But no matter how hard you try, there is no considerable effect.</p>
<p>In the research laboratory of General Electric, many scientific experts spent a lot of effort and thought, seeking fundamental methods in scientific principles, and not just thinking about "treating the head when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts," and eventually benefited in practice.</p>
<p>The brittleness of the filament can indeed be solved by refining tungsten. However, the blackening of the bulb glass must be solved. So I thought that the vacuum in the bulb must have something to do with it. Therefore, I wanted to start by improving the manufacturing method of vacuum, but I hit a wall again. So I proceeded along two paths! One path was to investigate the source of gas in the bulb, and the other path was to seek the influence of various gases on the bulb.</p>
<p>Research results show that a little water vapor in the bulb makes the bulb easier to turn black. Because water vapor oxidizes tungsten and discharges hydrogen gas in atomic state. Tungsten oxide reaches the bulb and is changed by active hydrogen, restoring it to metallic tungsten. Hydrogen still combines with oxygen to form water. This cycle continues, thus sending the light bulb to its end.</p>
<p>The first experimenters - including Edison - had thought about using various gases to fill the light bulb. However, the results of the research showed that gas-filled light bulbs were not as good as the vacuum carbon filament bulbs that were popular at the time. Later experiments proved that if the tungsten filament is in a completely dry bulb and then heated to near melting (3370°), and at the same time it is filled with gas, the life of the filament is much longer than in a vacuum; and the heavier the gas used, the slower the evaporation of the metal, i.e., the tungstatization. It is true that adding gas can prolong the life of the light bulb. But at the same time, a lot of heat is lost.</p>
<p>The dense gas, like nitrogen or argon, which has never been used before, reduces the evaporation of the bulb filament at the same temperature, down to one percent of what it used to be in a vacuum. And because of the exchange effect of the gas, the tungsten oxide is brought to the top of the bulb and sinks, and it will not hinder the light.</p>
<p>Later, coiled filaments, which are made by coiling tungsten filaments into a spiral shape, were used, so that the temperature can be even higher, thus increasing the luminous efficiency and making the light emitted whiter.</p>
<p>The story described above shows that only through careful and thorough research can the commonly used light bulbs of today be obtained. Compared with the original carbon filament bulbs, there is a world of difference. Who would want to use old-fashioned light bulbs again?</p>
<h3>Using Radio to Guide Workers in Tunneling</h3>
<p>— Rong Ren</p>
<p>Tunneling is a difficult project in modern architecture. However, the need for tunnels is increasing day by day for opening railways, laying water pipes, or building defensive works. All tunneling requires drilling in from both ends to achieve twice the result with half the effort. However, when drilling in from both ends, the direction must be extremely accurate, otherwise there will inevitably be a difference of a hair's breadth, resulting in a thousand miles of error. In the past, the determination of direction relied entirely on surveying instruments. The measurement and calculation were not easy, and the result could not be perfect. Now there is a kind of radio direction finder, which is enough to guide workers to move forward in the mountains, not to go astray, and to move forward in a straight line from both ends. Tunneling workers only need to follow the through-mountain radio to move forward to reach their destination. This method can reduce many of the difficulties of tunneling. The Florence River Tunnel in the United States, which passes through the rugged mountains with hard granite, is 13 miles long and is the longest tunnel in the world. Tunneling workers also used radio as a guide. The location where workers drilling in from both ends met in the mountains differed by only thirty-six thousandths of an inch. The magnitude of its effect can be imagined.</p>

<h3>Limiting Electrical Appliances That Violate Racing Orders</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>There is now an ingenious electrical appliance that issues racing orders, which is enough to limit racers from adhering to the sound of the gun and not rushing ahead. The wiring of this electrical appliance is very simple, as shown in the figure. When the racers are preparing to start, they need to press a pad with one hand. Each pad is connected in series by a wire to the gun in the hand of the commander, so his gun can only fire when each racer's hand is pressing on each person's pad. If one person lifts his hand before the order is given, the circuit will be interrupted and the gun will not fire. This can align the start time without the disadvantage of rushing ahead.</p>
<h3>World Science News</h3>
<p>Invisible Airplane</p>
<p>The British Practical Mechanics magazine states that the country's aircraft experts recently tested a new material for making aircraft that can be used to make almost invisible aircraft. This material is transparent, like glass, but much stronger than glass, and can be molded into any shape using a specially made press. Military aircraft made of this material are extremely difficult to see in multiple lights, and it is even more difficult to see when it is flying over water and looking down at it from above. It is said that this secret material is as strong as any aircraft material currently used.</p>

<p>Iron Slag Can Be Made into Glass</p>
<p>Soda ash is an important raw material for making ordinary glass sheets or utensils. But in India, soda ash is relatively expensive. Therefore, after many tests, it has now been found that iron slag in steel mills can be used as a raw material for manufacturing ordinary glassware. When manufacturing, this iron slag needs to be assisted with syenite. It is said that the price of this ordinary glass produced in India can be reduced by 50%. This glass is now used for bottles, tiles, and other utensils.</p>

<p>Analysis of Tobacco Leaf Smoke</p>
<p>According to the results of a recent analysis of tobacco leaf smoke by a German food chemist, the combustion of tobacco leaves produces a mixture of gas and steam. The gas emitted is nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and unused oxygen. Other gases are also present, but in very small quantities. The steam, i.e., the real smoke, is emitted from the red-hot area. The formation of this steam is mostly due to the substances in the tobacco, i.e., resins and resin-like substances, higher hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds, the most notable of which is nicotine. When this steam cools in the air, it generates a colloidal fog, a fog with water vapor condensed on solid particles. When the temperature reaches above 300 degrees Celsius, tobacco leaf smoke cannot exist because it has completely vaporized. After cooling, the fog reappears.</p>

<p>Malleable Iron</p>
<p>Dr. Vans Vogt of Berlin has recently invented a very soft iron that can be kneaded into any desired shape. Its manufacturing method is to place iron powder in a container filled with hydrogen gas, and process it at a very high temperature—1200 to 1300 degrees Celsius—to obtain this novel iron, which is sponge-like; then treat it with resin to prevent rust. This new material is extremely useful for repairing water pipes or oil pipes.</p>

<h3>University Students Reduced to Beggars</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>This is really shocking news, and it is also a serious problem: in Shanghai, university students, and even university graduates, have been reduced to beggars!</p>
<p>According to the International Relief Committee, the organization is conducting a detailed investigation into the reasons why they have been reduced to beggars in order to extend moral education and teach them productive skills. This is good. Before the results of the investigation are published, we will naturally not know the full picture of the reasons. But there are a few points that we can speculate on.</p>
<p>Of course, we all know that war is the biggest and most direct reason, leading to many employed people losing their jobs, and unemployed people being unable to find jobs, making them so poor that they have nowhere to go, so they have to be reduced to beggars. Some university students or university graduates cannot escape this net, so they have to act as "General Stretch-Hands." However, let's think again, can they, especially university students or university graduates, completely blame the war?</p>
<p>As far as university students or university graduates are concerned, we know that since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, many have rushed to the mainland to engage in practical national salvation work. Of course, there are inevitably some who originally had difficulty living in Shanghai. Why didn't these beggars go to the mainland?</p>
<p>It is of course difficult to maintain the original occupation in Shanghai, and it is of course not easy to find a suitable occupation, especially in this period of the Anti-Japanese War. Except for consumer organizations, all industries are depressed, and the idle talents can be said to be full of pits and valleys. But let us think, can such intellectuals really do nothing else but be beggars? Suppose they are strong, why don't they pull rickshaws or do other labor? If they are good at talking, why don't they become salesmen or waiters? If they can write, why don't they set up a fortune-telling stall or write letters for people? In short, why don't they make other plans besides being beggars? If being a beggar is still doable, what legitimate things can't be done?</p>
<p>I believe that a person's unemployment or joblessness is certainly related to the oppression of the external environment, but the internal lack of motivation of the individual is really very important. Suppose this person has a skill or only brute force that can be sold, but he can be loyal to what he does, have no bad habits, or decadent temperament, I can say that this person will definitely not be unemployed, and even if he is occasionally unemployed, he will definitely get a job easily. In other words, his relatives and friends, those who are related to him in his job, will definitely be willing to maintain him and help him. He will never be reduced to a beggar!</p>
<p>I dare not say that the reason why these university students or university graduates have been reduced to beggars is all because of their own sins; however, I believe that their own sins must be the biggest reason. One who creates one's own sins cannot live, not just as a beggar.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that: teaching productive skills is crucial, and providing moral education is also important!</p>
<h3>At Bai Tahe</h3>
<p>— Tong Shouping</p>
<p>—A Record of Mobile Propaganda</p>
<p>A few streaks of white clouds are painted diagonally in the sky. The winter sun is so gentle; in a while, the fragile light is also obscured by white clouds.</p>
<p>The wind is blowing hard. Eight or nine young people had already gathered in front of the courtyard to prepare to depart. Everyone took the things they should use: four skill education guns, a white cloth flag.... The short line walked towards the predetermined destination - Bai Tahe - under the attention of passers-by.</p>
<p>The wind blew on us, and our ears were frozen red. Excited and impassioned songs echoed in the air. Passers-by, tenant farmers in the fields, all stared at us with surprised eyes.</p>
<p>"Go to Bai Tahe to see a play, it's free. We're starting our propaganda."</p>
<p>"Then we'll go - really?" Although they had a skeptical attitude, some people followed us involuntarily, walking a long way behind.</p>
<p>In a burst of shouts of "Defend our motherland" and "Support our supreme leader," our line circled this small town. The whole town was shaken, and many people walked into the streets. They were very excited and nervous, and some even raised their fists:</p>
<p>"Don't be a slave of a conquered country! We must resist to the end!" This call merged with us, and the surrounding air was agitated.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen, the principal of Bai Tahe Primary School, invited us from the street to his school. We rested for a while and drank a cup of hot tea.</p>
<p>"Your enthusiasm really makes people ashamed and admired!" The humble Principal Chen said with a smile: "I'm afraid you haven't eaten yet, so please have a meal here!"</p>
<p>"We ate early. We shouldn't have come here to disturb you, but for the convenience of propaganda, we have to ask Principal Chen for guidance."</p>
<p>"Don't dare, don't dare!" He turned to a student and said, "Go and tell them!"</p>
<p>We were comforted and silent.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry!" Principal Chen is too polite, and he treated us so sincerely. We are very ashamed.</p>
<p>After resting for a while, we walked out of the school again. We formed three small teams and went to give speeches, post slogans, and sing songs. At the same time, we also told them:</p>
<p>"This afternoon, please stop working for half a day and come to the Doutian Temple. We will perform interesting civilized plays for you to watch." They responded with universal cheers.</p>
<p>It was afternoon, the sky was still very gray, and the wind was blowing even harder. Just at lunchtime, the large courtyard of the Doutian Temple was already filled with a crowd of people. Under their eager anticipation, we resolutely boarded the "Wan Nian Tai" that specializes in performing ancient plays. The things we should use were also taken up by the school staff on our behalf. After Comrade Ying's passionate speech, several scripts that we wrote ourselves, such as "Northeast Compatriots," "Muddleheads," and "Catching Traitors," were also performed successively under the joint efforts of the comrades, interspersed with singing. More and more audiences gathered below, forgetting their fatigue, and staring at us seriously with gritted teeth; they stood for four full hours.</p>
<p>The dark twilight gradually enveloped the gray-white sky. Under their calls for continued performances, we stopped performing in order to rush back to our base. The audience dispersed reluctantly, with satisfaction and anti-enemy emotions. We also brought back a harvest of excitement under the encouragement of Principal Chen, braving the north wind.</p>
<h3>Head-on Blow (Woodcut)</h3>
<p>— Li Yishan</p>
<h3>Warrior</h3>
<p>— Gao Xiaozhong</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>It was the time when the morning light was just beginning to appear.</p>
<p>A robust warrior stood solemnly on a mound of earth: a steel helmet, a long face, a military uniform. Standing straight.</p>
<p>Looking at his appearance: thick, black eyebrows, triangular eyes, a high nose, a large mouth, a dark brown forehead, and earthy red cheeks.</p>
<p>"Where are you from, old friend?"</p>
<p>"Me? I'm from the Northeast."</p>
<p>"How many years have you been away from home, old friend?"</p>
<p>"Six years, since that incident."</p>
<p>"Are your parents still alive?"</p>
<p>"..." Looking at his bitter face, one understood.</p>
<p>"Your wife...?"</p>
<p>"No!" He forced out the word "no," and anger blazed across his face.</p>
<p>"Old friend! Now you can take revenge!"</p>
<p>He bit his lip and nodded.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>A fierce battle was raging on the plains.</p>
<p>Red fire, red blood, red insignia. Boom boom boom boom boom, earth-shattering cannons drew huge arcs of vacuum in the sky. Airplanes droned low overhead, machine guns stuttered incessantly around, forming great streaks of fire, and constant bombs exploded, tossing the earth into the sky: "Sizzle, sizzle... Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom," shouts of killing covered the wilderness: "Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill..." A torrent of iron and blood crashed past...</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Let the sky be inlaid with red, let the grass drink fresh blood, and a bloody battle came to an end.</p>
<p>Anxiously going to see friends: faces radiant with a red glow, wide chests exposed, large eyes still filled with lingering excitement, some smiles.</p>
<p>Patting his bald head, and saying, "How was it?"</p>
<p>"Wonderful! I cut down eight in a row, so refreshing!" Touching the scar on his arm, he smiled.</p>
<h3>Defense Line</h3>
<p>— Tingmei</p>
<p>The enemy has fled.</p>
<p>Before the defense line stained with blood,</p>
<p>We buried the remains of our comrades,</p>
<p>The abandoned guns, ammunition pouches,</p>
<p>We handed them over to the brothers who came after.</p>
<p>On this defense line, under the scorching sun,</p>
<p>We wiped away sweat with our sleeves;</p>
<p>We shivered in the wind and snow;</p>
<p>We also counted the stars on autumn nights,</p>
<p>And saw the magnificent earth with wildflowers.</p>
<p>We each dedicated our lives to the country,</p>
<p>Firmly believing that justice will be served,</p>
<p>And that tyranny must eventually be destroyed!</p>
<p>At that time, we will blow the horn of victory,</p>
<p>On this defense line where the bones of our comrades are buried.</p>
<h3>After-Talk</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>We often see submissions that, when referring to China's population, use the figure "450 million." The meaning is correct, but the second "wan" (ten thousand) is superfluous. It should be written as "450 million." Otherwise, it becomes "40,000 ten thousands" plus "50 million."</p>
<p>Submissions also often use the phrase "old wine in new bottles," but "bottle" is incorrect. This phrase comes from the Bible, where the English word is "flask," originally translated as a "leather bag." Because new wine has a high expansive force, old leather bags are prone to rupture, so they are incompatible. A bottle, however, is very strong and hard, and has nothing to do with whether the wine is old or new.</p>
<h3>Reciting History</h3>
<p>— Qinghou</p>
<p>I want to recite a bit of history, but I don't know if it will be annoying or not.</p>
<p>In the notes of Song people, one often sees the atrocities committed by the Jin and Yuan people when they invaded China. In addition to the "daily fare" of looting women and plundering property, there was also the trampling of China's old cultural relics. It is said that when the Jin people arrived in Qufu, they burned the Confucius Temple and even cursed the statues. The Yuan people not only burned several Confucius Temples in the same industry, but also took the scriptures to brush horses. — The former item probably comes from Zhuang Jiyu's "Chicken Rib Compilation," and the latter item I can't recall the source for a moment, but it is also in the notes of the people, and it is written in a customary manner.</p>
<p>However, the changes are really very fast. After the Jin people settled in northern China, they learned the old ways of the Chinese and also began to "select scholars through imperial examinations," and the subjects not only included Ci poetry but also the most important Classics. Although the Jurchen script was being promoted, they quickly translated the "Book of Documents." Although our scholars have always regarded this as ironclad proof of the assimilation of barbarians by Chinese culture, in fact, on the other hand, it was to enable those in positions of power to understand the old things of China so that they could be used as magic weapons to rule the Chinese people. As for the Yuan people after they had a "dynasty," that is even more well known: Confucius was also honored as "the Most Accomplished Sage and Teacher King of Culture," and the study of Confucianism was especially emphasized, and Zhu Xi suddenly became popular. Using the old things of China to conquer China, the methods became more thorough and more powerful.</p>
<p>It is just that our past scholar-officials are really worthy of admiration: seeing the invasion of foreign tribes, they were indignant; but their indignation at the trampling of old things seemed to be much more intense than their indignation at the massacre of large numbers of lives. And the invaders finally saw this spirit of ours, so when they sat firmly in power, they especially brought out our old things. And this immediately took effect, our scholar-officials not only forgot their previous indignation, but from then on wholeheartedly became the adopted sons of the new masters. — And, even to this day, some people still insist that Genghis Khan is our ancestor. Our loyalty to the Yuan dynasty has really been maintained for a long time.</p>
<p>After the Manchus entered the pass, what was the situation regarding the trampling of China's old cultural relics? Strangely, there are texts recording the Manchu massacres, but there seem to be very few texts recording the Manchu trampling of old cultural relics. Could it be that the Manchus were more civilized than the Jin and Yuan people? I don't think so. The Manchus were only more clever than the Jin and Yuan people, and more clear about our psychology. After they had a "dynasty," they used a lot of hard work in banning books and deleting books: for the achievements of "massacring cities" to boast of their own martial prowess, they sometimes even let some of them remain, but for the records of trampling old cultural relics that particularly made us feel disgusted, they probably "destroyed" them all. This is not just blind speculation. Just the passage about burning temples and cursing statues in the "Chicken Rib Compilation" mentioned above was revised and deleted by the Qing Dynasty. That was only talking about the Jin people, but the Qing Dynasty still had to revise and delete it, which shows that on the one hand, they had also done such things, and on the other hand, there is no doubt that they certainly would not leave a shadow of their own achievements in this regard.</p>
<p>And the Qing Dynasty was even more vigorous in promoting our old things. Confucius was promoted higher and higher, needless to say, "eight-legged essays" became the orthodox literature, and needless to say; just looking at the "Imperial Compilation" or "Imperially Approved" such-and-such "collection of commentaries" and "annotations" of the Classics, one can know the bustling scene. The effect of this time was even greater. Our scholar-officials were really so happy that they were all smiles, forgetting the countless "massacres of cities" in the past, forgetting many literary inquisitions, and filled their mouths with "Our Dynasty," "Our Dynasty." It didn't matter how "Our Dynasty" blessed and dominated us, because it could "investigate the past and value literature."</p>
<p>Looking down from history, our scholar-officials' love of restoring the old is really greater than their love of the nation. — Of course, on the surface, restoring the old is still restoring the "old" of the nation, but in practice, they often only recognize the "old" and do not recognize the nation. The invaders understood this very well, so their policy was always: just give you those "old" things. They knew that the more "old" things they gave you, the lower you would bend your waist and the louder you would kowtow.</p>
<p>Reciting history is naturally dry. My meaning is nothing else, just to say: restoring the old is not only not a weapon to save the nation, but on the contrary, it is a weapon for the invaders to destroy us.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Special Issue of the Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties</p>
<h3>The Quality of the Exhibition of Chinese Paintings of Past Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>The more advanced a nation's culture is, the more urgent it feels for spiritual comfort. In primitive times, human knowledge was shallow, and the main needs were the supply of food and clothing. Apart from directly working for their food and clothing, they lived in groups and fought for dominance, with no spiritual response. As culture advanced, cruel fighting became an immoral expression, and monotonous life really needed adjustment. Thus, spiritual activities began: music, dance, poetry, painting, and all other arts emerged in response. Therefore, any nation where art flourishes is the earliest civilized country, the reason for this is clear, and there are many examples: in Europe and the West, it is Greece and Rome; in East Asia, it is our Chinese nation, whose culture and politics have formed a bright and brilliant history. And painting, in particular, is full of subtle principles, embellishing rites and systems, greatly assisting education, representing virtues and eulogizing merits, and everything from bronze tripods and ritual vessels relies heavily on painting. As for heavenly dragon treasures, hell transformation images, portraits of sages and worthies, and the works of meritorious ministers in the Unicorn Pavilion, they are deeply moving and cause people to reflect deeply, which is not only a success of painting, but also a great achievement of national culture. Moreover, its style is simple and profound, emphasizing brush and ink, respecting charm, emphasizing verisimilitude and expressiveness, and focusing on spirit and subtlety. Its tranquility and peace occupy the highest peak of world art.</p>
<p>Since painting has the function of educating and humanizing people, emperors of all dynasties have done their best to promote it, establishing official positions to manage it, and using painting to select scholars. Liu (Songnian), Li (Tang), Ma (Yuan), and Xia (Gui) carefully created masterpieces, which often came from the court style, which was rigorous and simple, and differed in its purpose from the Jiangnan landscapes and ink paintings of Dong (Yuan), Ju (Ran), Mi (Fu), and Guo (Xi). However, they were all only for the appreciation of a small number of emperors and aristocratic classes. Poor commoners had no way to even take a glimpse. Therefore, the value of painting could not be fully realized, and the significance of painting could not be widely revealed, which is a deep sigh! Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the Southern School has flourished, with Huang (Zijiu), Wang (Shuming), Ni (Yunlin), Wu (Zhonggui), Wen (Zhengming), Shen (Shitian), Dong (Qichang), and Tang (Liuru), who were light and elegant in their brushstrokes. Although the emperors favored it, the folk style was like water flowing downwards, implicitly revealing the trend of ideological liberation. Compared with the scholar-officials who were immersed in the eight-legged essay and did not know how to extricate themselves, the painters had already taken the lead in culture! During the Qing Dynasty, the Four Wangs (Yanke, Yuanzhao, Shigu, Lutai), Wu (Yushan), and Yun (Nantian) and others were not without outstanding works. However, from the Five Dynasties and the Two Songs to the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, how many famous masterpieces were there? Some were lost in water and fire, and some were destroyed in wars. Over the past thousand years, they have become as rare as morning stars. After the establishment of the Republic of China, although the Palace Museum was established based on the Qing Dynasty's collection, with exhibitions open for people to visit, it was only limited to one part and one place. The person in charge was unable to fully display its abilities, and there was much that should have been promoted, resulting in low efficiency and poor results.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, painting exhibitions have been held almost every year and everywhere, but they have all been fragmentary, with narrow collections and unfurnished displays. Even worse, there is a mix of fake and genuine items. It is impossible to find a systematic and valuable painting exhibition. The only ones are the National Art Exhibition of the Ministry of Education and the Shanghai preview of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art! Now, major domestic collectors, in view of this, have jointly launched the Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties in Shanghai. In the past, those who cherished their deep collections and were unwilling to easily show them to others are now exhibiting all their possessions publicly for the appreciation of the public. The meaning of this is profound, and the value is great, which need not be repeated. In terms of content, it is not inferior to the Shanghai preview of the previous London Art Exhibition; in terms of quantity, it surpasses the Shanghai preview. (According to the above, the calligraphy and painting section of the London Art Exhibition only had more than 200 pieces). However, when we are in the midst of the famous works of the ancients, while enjoying the scenery and pleasing our hearts, we should also seek the true meaning in the brush and ink of the writers of the past, in addition to their skills, their moral cultivation, and the forging of their character. We should also realize this great national spirit, strengthen our beliefs, and encourage our future, in order to be loyal to our country and nation! As for the excellence of the exhibits, I will discuss them in another article.</p>
<h3>After Visiting the Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties at the Great World Company</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Recently, there have been so many calligraphy and painting exhibitions that one is almost overwhelmed, like on the Shanyin Road. However, the "Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties" is so remarkable that, except for the exhibition held in Shanghai when the calligraphy and painting of the Palace Museum were transported to London for display the year before last, this is probably the first time.</p>
<p>There are two differences between this calligraphy and painting exhibition and ordinary calligraphy and painting exhibitions: (1) Ordinary calligraphy and painting exhibitions are commercial in nature and are entirely for the purpose of personal rights, while this exhibition is all non-sales items. The proceeds from the tickets are all given to the Shanghai Medical Association for medical relief. One is a commercial exhibition, and the other is a charitable exhibition. Their meanings are very different. (2) Ordinary calligraphy and painting exhibitions are aimed at making profits, so the calligraphy and paintings listed are a mixture of genuine and fake, good and bad, and even there is not a single item worth seeing. However, the calligraphy and paintings listed here are mostly valuable works sent by several major collectors for display at the exhibition. Since there is no intention to make a profit, there must be no intention to deceive people with counterfeit goods. If they are willing to provide exhibitions, they must be fine works and masterpieces. Therefore, the calligraphy and paintings listed are naturally different from ordinary exhibitions.</p>
<p>The calligraphy and paintings displayed this time are all representative works of various eras and masters from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Appraisers and collectors have long established evaluations of these works. There is no need for me to add to the praise. However, since the loss of collectors in various war zones after the fall of the various war zones is naturally immeasurable, and the number of antiques and calligraphy and paintings has suddenly decreased sharply, antiques and calligraphy and paintings must inevitably become historically famous and valuable. However, the collectors who were able to carefully collect and preserve the calligraphy and paintings of the past dynasties so that they would not be destroyed are already rare and valuable. Now, they are able to display the items that they have carefully collected and preserved for the appreciation of the world. This is an even more rare and great act, so artists and art lovers in the world must not miss it. Moreover, aesthetic concepts are originally shared by all human beings, and compassion is also a human sympathy, so even if they are not connoisseurs, they also have the necessity to go together and feast their eyes.</p>
<p>Although I am a layman in the field of calligraphy and painting, I have also caught a glimpse of it. Let's not talk about calligraphy, let's talk about painting. There are many schools of painting in our country, and it is impossible to investigate them all. There are the Northern School, the Southern School, the paintings of Confucian scholars, the paintings of painters, the paintings of the Academy School, and the paintings of non-Academy School. However, although there are many schools, they are all based on the eight methods, and among the eight methods, there are only two methods, namely brush and ink. For example, in arithmetic, there are many names, and there are thousands of changes, but in fact, there are only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multiplication is addition, and division is subtraction. The result is only addition and subtraction. Recently, painters have also been divided into two schools, one is Western painting, and the other is Chinese painting. Western painting is realism, and Chinese painting is idealism. Although their positions are different, Chinese painting emphasizes brush and ink, and Western painting emphasizes lines, light and shadow. Lines are brushes, and light and shadow are ink. The names are different, but the principles are the same. Therefore, if Chinese painting does not have the realism of Western painting, it cannot be called a famous painting. If Western painting does not have the ideal spirit of Chinese painting, it cannot be called a masterpiece.</p>
<p>In the early Qing Dynasty, the Four Wangs, Wu Yun, and Yun Nantian were known as masters, and Wu Mojing slightly adopted Western methods in his later years, and future generations inevitably had criticisms. The Italian Lang Shining used Western painting to participate in the methods of Chinese painting, and eventually became a master. In recent times, the paintings of Cheng Yaosheng, Wu Shixian, etc., also slightly participated in Western methods, and people have also praised them a lot. Chinese painting has its advantages, and Western painting has its advantages, but Chinese painting and Western painting originally belong to the same principle. Western painting should be realistic, and why doesn't Chinese painting emphasize realism? Chinese painting values ideals, and why doesn't Western painting value ideals?</p>
<p>I am neither a Chinese painter nor a Western painter. When I visited the calligraphy and paintings listed in the exhibition, from the Tang and Song dynasties to the Manchu Qing, most of them were representative masterpieces of various masters of various eras. From this, I saw the changes in Chinese painting over the past thousands of years, and I can see that although there are many schools of Chinese painting, there has never been anyone who can become a famous artist without paying attention to the brush and ink. If there is, it is a vulgar stream of Jianghu. Because I visited this "Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties," I had some feelings, so I wrote this in a disorganized way.</p>
<h3>The Authenticity and Identification of Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>— Pan Boshan</p>
<p>There are few genuine works of calligraphy and painting by famous people throughout the ages, and the supply cannot meet the demand, and the creation of forgeries is becoming more and more frequent. The high-quality ones can confuse the real ones, and even those with decisive skills are enough to meet the market. Therefore, genuine and fake products are mixed, and even collectors cannot avoid the feelings of Li Qiu. I once read Sun Yuefeng's inscription on Shen Shitian's landscape album, which said: "There are many forgeries of this old man, but I have also seen one or two genuine works from collectors." He also inscribed on Wen Hengshan's poetry and painting scroll: "The ancients said that if you want to see Hengweng's calligraphy and painting, you must enter his studio and ask him to make them in person in order to get good ones and no forgeries. Now I see this is indeed the case." An Shifeng's inscription on Tang Liuru's Fallen Flowers Scroll in Molin Kuai Shi also said: "I have collected enough paintings by Bohu to fill a room, but they are all forgeries. Only one single scroll and one long scroll are genuine." Sun An was a master of appraisal, and he was less than a hundred years away from Shen Wen Tang. What he saw, collected, and said was still like this. Today, three hundred years have passed since Sun An, and it is difficult to seek genuine products from among ten thousand or one hundred thousand.</p>
<p>I collected a letter from Hengshan to Qian Shubao that said: "There are four fans, please paint them. One should be lightly colored, and the rest only need to be lightly inked. Do not sign them, and set a deadline of three days." I also saw Wang Shigu's letter to Gu Ruotong that said: "Danweng's long scroll is urgently waiting to be colored. Zihe has already embellished the figures and houses." Shen Xuez's inscription on Xiang Gongfu's painting of plum blossoms said: "I heard that old Dongxin is living as a guest, and he charges directly for each silk painting. How can I know that they are all made by my brother? It's a pity that no one recognizes the counterfeit products." It can be known that most of Dongxin's paintings of plum blossoms were made by Gongfu on his behalf. Now, the vulgar eye does not observe, values gold and despises Xiang. It is known that since ancient times, famous artists have often had substitutes under their doors, which is a common practice. It is really difficult to speak of distinguishing between genuine and fake products when brush and ink are passed down.</p>
<p>In the past, great writers often played with Samadhi, imitating famous brushes to deceive the world. Looking at the famous works of Xi Xian, most of them are forgeries of Mi Zhao. The predecessors have already discussed this in detail. With the buttocks method of Mi Zhao, imitating Yi Xian from a thousand years ago, how can the vulgar eyes be able to distinguish them?</p>
<p>There are three points to discuss about forgeries of calligraphy and painting: (1) works made by friends and brothers on behalf of the artist; (2) works forged at the same time; (3) works imitated by later generations. Imitation is the easiest to identify, forgery at the same time is more difficult to distinguish, but if it is a work on behalf of the artist, the imitated brush and ink must be similar, and the seal used must be the same. If one is not well-versed in research, how can one meet with the eyes?</p>
<p>So, how can the authenticity of calligraphy and painting be distinguished? I say: The texture of silk and the luster of ink should be studied to the extreme using scientific methods; Times change, and brush and ink change, so the truth should be obtained with an academic eye; But this is not enough to fully distinguish the ability. Calligraphy and painting are the same as poetry and prose, so they express the spirit of man. The spirit is entrusted to the brush and ink, and where the brush and ink reach, the spirit remains. The character of people is different, so their calligraphy and painting also differ in interest with the pen. Although it is a slight point and a slight brush, fathers, sons, teachers, and friends cannot seem to be the same. The gist is neither a vacuous word to be understood nor is there physical evidence to be proven. Reading extensively and thinking deeply, if you enlighten and understand, you will not make any mistakes in the difference between genuine and fake calligraphy and painting.</p>
<p>The genuine works of the Jin and Tang dynasties are far away. Most of the famous pens of the two Song dynasties were collected in the inner government, and they were as rare as stars in the outside world. In the past, I only imagined and understood them based on the imitations of later generations and the biographies, and got a general idea. After the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, the heavenly palace changed hands. The treasures of the Forbidden City were frequently exhibited, so that since the two Song dynasties, the famous ink treasures and paintings of Mount Lu finally revealed their true faces to the world, and the art forest has a true understanding, and the identification has also developed in a new way.</p>
<p>In recent times, the art of collotype printing has been invented, and public and private collections have followed suit and circulated the images. The fine versions are only one level below the genuine works. Although silk and ink colors cannot be fully transmitted, the general meaning of the ancients' use of the pen is enough for research. Is this not a great blessing for collectors?</p>
<p>In recent times, collectors have changed their old habits of secret play and have exhibited their collections one after another for the appraisal of their peers. Those who love the ancient and are quick to seek, since they have genuine works to compare, and then have printed copies for reference, then all the silk ink colors, and the ancient people's pen and pen interests, have clues to find, and the heart understands the spirit, and the authenticity is not difficult to distinguish.</p>

<h3>Yuan Dynasty Paintings in the Exhibition of Paintings of Past Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Xu Bangda</p>
<p>Painting flourishes in the Tang Dynasty, prospers in the Song Dynasty, and is great in the Yuan Dynasty. The Tang Dynasty values quality, the Song Dynasty values literature, and the rationality is still incomplete. When the Yuan Dynasty succeeded, it washed away the traces of carving in the Tang and Song Dynasties, discarded its dross, and extracted its essence. Therefore, the imagery is transcendent, the technique advances to the Tao, and the secrets of heaven and earth's creation are revealed without loss through the brush. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, although talented people have emerged, they only narrated but did not create, and in the end, they are suspected of building houses under houses. Those who talk about sound occasionally say that poetry has been done by predecessors, so is painting not also the same? If you want to find the leader in the art world, you must return to the Yuan Dynasty. Let's take the works of the Yuan Dynasty in the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties as an example, such as the orchids and bamboos of the Zhao family (Zhao Mengfu and Zhao Yong), Huang Zijiu's Jiufeng Snow Clearing; Wang Shuming's Winter Green Thatched Cottage, Secluded Residence in the Forest; Ni Yunlin's Green Water Garden; Ma Wenbi's The Poetic Meaning of Mo Yun; Fang Fanghu's Youxing of Stream Bridge; Guo Tianxi's Yunshan; Wang Guyun and Zhang Shuhou's White Sketch of Revealing Bowl Picture and Nine Songs, all are majestic, resolute, broad, and large, profound, elegant, Hun, and Mu. The majestic and resolute are vast and forward, refined, fierce, and strong, and the broad and large stare at the nine heavens and wander through the ages. The profound and elegant are free from vulgarity, and the Hun and Mu gather all the edges. All of these gentlemen have these several beauties, and some are slightly biased in their strengths. Zhao Songxue and his son, Guo Tianxi, Ma Wenbi, Wang Guyun, and Zhang Shuhou are immersed in the profound, elegant, Hun, and Mu; Huang Zijiu, Wang Shuming, and Fang Fanghu are close to the majestic, resolute, broad, and large; If Ni Gaoshi's a wisp of stone, short bamboo, sparse, seems to be a kind of light and ease, but carefully taste its majestic and broad place, I feel that Huang Wang and several others should also give way a step, and it is worth bowing down. Examining the deeds of the gentlemen, whether they are officials and gentlemen, or strange scholars and high sages, all can read thousands of books and travel thousands of miles. When they pick up the topic, they stretch out the paper and wave the brush, they have bamboo in their chest and no whole cow in their eyes. The so-called pen has not reached the point where the gas has swallowed it, so it can be complete in spirit and intention, and the opportunity is wanton. How can vulgar craftsmen and lowly craftsmen describe their heads and draw their corners? Therefore, it is said that since the Yuan Dynasty came out, the painting path was completed, since the Yuan Dynasty came out, the painting path was exhausted, and since the Yuan Dynasty, future students and late scholars could not jump over its grasp. I was born hundreds of years after the Yuan Dynasty, and I was fortunate to have a quick view of its surviving pictures and wonderful traces. I was also born hundreds of years after the Yuan Dynasty, and I will eventually be a cattle and horse walking, and I will bow my head and lower my heart, and I will not be able to shake myself in the seat at the end of the painting garden. This is a discussion on Yuan Dynasty painting.</p>

<h3>The Entire Shanghai Film Industry Should Participate in the Charity Bazaar Movement</h3>
<p>— Hai Yi</p>
<p>— Contributing a Few Concrete Suggestions Here</p>
<p>I heard that the International Red Cross Society is launching a large-scale charity bazaar movement in the next few days. The scope it encompasses is broad, meaning that any kind of business should donate one day's business or a portion of its income to the charity bazaar movement on that day. If such a movement can truly be opened up universally, then this charity bazaar movement will certainly achieve excellent results.</p>
<p>As for all the funds from the income, it has been stipulated that they will be entirely allocated to refugee relief. People in the rear, like those in Shanghai, should make more of an effort in the charity bazaar movement, as they should.</p>
<p>In addition to the industrial and commercial sectors, students, and the press all collectively participating in this charity bazaar movement, we also harbor the same ardent hope for the Shanghai film industry.</p>
<p>I think that Chinese film practitioners and film producers and theater owners who are slightly concerned about the war in the motherland and the refugees in various places will definitely participate in this movement more enthusiastically than anyone else.</p>
<p>I believe that the film industry should participate in this charity bazaar movement in three ways:</p>
<p>First, participation as individual film practitioners. Here, every male and female film practitioner, from actors and directors to cinematographers and set designers, should participate in this movement. I think there can be several ways to do this: (1) Autograph books of male and female stars and directors. Autograph books with photos would be even better. Get all the male and female actors and directors in the company to sign their names as quickly as possible, and then set a price, how much each autograph book will sell for. (2) Photos of male and female stars signed in their own handwriting, and they can be inscribed at any time; (i.e., the name of the person buying the photo) (3) Embroidery and handicrafts by female stars, such as handkerchiefs and pillowcases; (4) Artistic works by male and female actors, directors, set designers, and cinematographers, such as paintings, sculptures, set models, and cinematographers taking photos for people using film techniques, etc. With so many movie fans in Shanghai, people will definitely be eager to buy them to help the refugees.</p>
<p>Second, participation as a company or group. It is hoped that the film industry can participate in Peking opera, spoken drama, and various entertainment performances on the day of the charity bazaar movement. Stars usually participate in performing plays when celebrating birthdays or weddings, and it is even more their duty to do so on the day of the charity bazaar movement. At the same time, all male and female actors can sell a kind of commemorative badge for the film industry's charity bazaar movement. Male and female stars will personally wear the badge for the buyer (or give away a flower), which will surely encourage customers to buy it.</p>
<p>Third, film producers and theater owners must cooperate to donate all the theater's income on this day to the charity bazaar movement. Film companies and theater owners stipulate that everyone will not split the profits, for example, "Mulan Joins the Army" by Hu Guang, "A Chronicle of the Film City" by Xin Guang, "Wu Zetian" by Jin Cheng, etc., and the four major cinemas such as Da Guangming must participate in this charity bazaar movement. The income from all the large and small Chinese film merchants' cinemas in Shanghai is also quite considerable.</p>
<p>If the above points can be implemented, then I think the film industry itself can be considered to have done its part for the country and the nation; and if the refugees can get a little education and the opportunity to learn production skills from this, this is also what the film industry people want to give.</p>
<p>We hope that this movement can be launched immediately, because time is very tight, and the several film companies and enthusiastic film practitioners in Shanghai should launch it immediately and put it into practice right away.</p>
<p>As for the employees of the American-owned China United Film Company, they are all Chinese, and their patriotic enthusiasm will certainly not lag behind others, so their participation in this charity bazaar movement is certainly a matter of duty.</p>
<p>We are waiting for the launch of this movement, and at the same time, the public opinion circles will certainly be willing to make the greatest efforts to promote and publicize this movement!</p>
<h3>Glimpses of the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— (Sha)</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan recently directed "Li Sanniang" for Guohua, scheduled to start filming tomorrow. It is said that Zhang plans to resume the Star Film Production in the autumn, as the company will be registered in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The day before Chen Yunshang left Shanghai, Tong Yuejuan specially gifted a diamond ring worth 1,700 yuan (actual price). The rumor of 17,000 yuan is inaccurate.</p>
<p>The film industry in the occupied areas is very active. Previous productions of various companies have been pirated and screened. Silent films are sold for about 200 yuan each.</p>
<p>Liu Zhonghao, manager of Jincheng and producer of Guohua, has been busy recently with the publicity plan for "Tears of Song." The big picture should be visible after the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Huang Jiamo's "Three Musketeers" movie song has been recorded by Pathé Records. This is his debut work and will definitely have gimmicks.</p>
<p>Bu Wancang is practicing frugality and has sold his car. Wu Yonggang also has news of going to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Gong Qiuyun is now surrounded by various film companies, all wanting to sign a long-term contract with her. It is said that Ms. Gong's proposed conditions emphasize directors and scripts. It remains to be seen which company will hire her.</p>
<p>Wu Cun will return to his hometown with his family, saying he has no intention of staying in the isolated island film scene.</p>
<p>Jin Yan's Lin Chong, some people say he looks like a "guerrilla captain."</p>

<p>— Xidi</p>
<p>Ma Lianliang Rushes to Rehearse New Play</p>
<p>Ma Lianliang is currently performing at the Xin Xin Theater in Beiping, with other roles played by Zhang Junqiu, Xiao Changhua, Li Duokui, etc. He has successively rehearsed "Qingfeng Pavilion," "Su Wu Grazing Sheep," "Ronghua Ji," and "Fishing for a Golden Turtle," and business is quite prosperous. Recently, Ma also invited Wu Huansun to write a new play for him, "Ten Old Men Comfort Liu." Wu was originally a famous playwright in China, and his relationship with Ma has always been very close. This decision to rush to write this play is extremely energetic. It is said that the content has a unique flavor. There are ten old men teasing each other in the play, which is truly unprecedented in the Peking opera world. The allocation of roles is indeed a problem, because all ten bearded roles in the play must be played by hard-line old men. Ma originally planned to teach and hire Ye Shenglan, Ma Fulu, Liu Lianrong, etc. to play the roles, but Ye Ma Liu and the three are now performing at the Shanghai Golden Grand Theater, so the plan has been changed. Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua, Yuan Shihai, etc. have been decided to join. All the costumes used in the whole play have been researched and are not perfunctory. As for the makeup, expert Weng Ouhong has been specially invited to draw it, and Ma himself has also obtained two extremely precious ones from the Shengping Office. According to the news obtained by my friend Mr. Ren, when the play is performed, in the last scene, ten bearded men appear on stage at the same time, which is infinitely interesting and truly unprecedented.</p>
<p>Shang Xiaoyun Newly Accepts Disciple</p>
<p>Shang Xiaoyun is still as popular as he used to be. He is currently leading Shang Changchun, Shang Fuxia, Wang Fengqing, Fan Baoting, Song Yuchun, etc. to perform at the Zhonghe and Chang'an theaters in Beiping. The plays include "Bandits of the Water Margin," "Nine Yang Bells," "Opening the Mountain Mansion," "Modengjia Girl," and "Lanling Daughter," etc. Zhonghe performs night plays, and Chang'an performs day plays. Last month, with the introduction of a famous qin master, he accepted Kunling Li Huijun as a disciple. The official apprenticeship ceremony was held at Shang's residence, and a banquet was held that evening to entertain people from all walks of life, which was extremely grand for a time.</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng's Voice Recovered</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng, a famous bearded actor and top performer in the old Tan school, used to be considered imperfect by the general public because of his weak voice. Recently, his voice has completely recovered, and he can fully develop the Tan style. During the old lunar new year, he performed in Dalian, and the box office has remained strong. Later, he went to Harbin to be hired by the local Huale Grand Theater, and decided to rehearse Tan school's signature plays such as "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao," and "Ascending to Heaven," "Hongyang Cave", etc. The prosperity of the business broke the record that Harbin has never had before. He may come to Shanghai in May of this year.</p>
<p>Tan Fuying recruits Qingyi</p>
<p>Tan Fuying has been working very hard recently to recruit powerful Qingyi roles. The reason is of course because he feels that his signature plays such as "Visiting the Mother" and "Entering the Palace Twice" cannot be supplemented and fully develop his strengths. Last month, the Tianjin China Grand Theater specially invited Tan Fuying and Zhang Junqiu to cooperate in performing. The business was very prosperous, and the appeal was really considerable, and "Entering the Palace Twice" and "Catching and Releasing Cao" were the most popular. After Tan decided to co-star with Zhang this time, he admired her art so much that he even invited her as a friend, and then asked someone to discuss with Zhang's teacher Li Lingfeng. The future is promising.</p>
<p>Zhang Junqiu is about to get married</p>
<p>The marriage problem of Zhang Junqiu has been noisy for a while in the past, but later it became silent. Recently, according to news from people close to Zhang, Junqiu will marry the eldest daughter of a famous qin master. The date is in the middle of August this year's lunar calendar. The combination of this marriage is also very interesting. It is said that the matchmaker is Zhang's stepmother, the wife of a famous dan. Zhang's father-in-law loves Zhang very much and often talks with him, with a great sense of "the father-in-law looks at the son-in-law, and the more he looks at him, the more interesting he becomes."</p>
<p>Li Shaochun Newly Practices Monkey Opera</p>
<p>According to a letter from a gentleman in Beiping, Li Shaochun has recently rehearsed a monkey opera called "Sun Wukong Captures Demons and Pacifies Bandits." The content of the play has many gimmicks, and it is much more advanced than the various monkey operas performed in the past. There is also a play called "Golden Leopard", which has real and fake Pigsy, and adds a lot of humorous singing and dialogues. It is the same as Yu Shuyan and Wang Youchen's Stealing Soul Bell in the past, and it is a formal play with bones. The flying fork in the play is also one of the most exciting parts, because the weapon used by the Golden Leopard is exactly the flying fork. Shaochun's flying fork is a unique skill, so when he performs, he will definitely arouse the audience's interest.</p>
<h3>A Quick Sketch of the Public Rest Amateur Peking Opera Rehearsal</h3>
<p>— Ticket Detective</p>
<p>The Public Rest Amateur Peking Opera Research Society organized by the Four Banks Savings Society specially borrowed the auditorium of the Guber Apartment for the third rehearsal during the Qingming holiday on the 8th and 9th. Famous ticket holders such as Hu Zhongwen, Fan Taofu, Pang Bingxia, Xu Jifang, and Sun Minhou all have wonderful performances. Here is a brief note of what I saw after watching.</p>
<p>I arrived at the Guber Apartment at about 8 o'clock last night. As soon as I entered the door, I saw a crowd of people and felt that I would have no place to stand. The capacity of this auditorium is quite large. Half of it is used as a stage, and half of it is arranged with seats. The decoration is magnificent, which is very rare. At that time, the second act of Ascending to Heaven was being performed on the stage. Guan Yaoqi's appearance was majestic and his voice was loud and clear, which was very suitable. The third act, Hongni Pass, was played by Pan Jingmei as the maid, and Sun Minhou as Wang Bodang and Yu Qianqiu as Dongfang, which had the beauty of peony and green leaves; Pan's appearance was extremely beautiful, slightly like Dr. Mei, and her voice was clear and sweet. The song from the section 26 was very pleasant to listen to with its ups and downs; (I think that if this gentleman can strive for further study, the future is limitless) Yu's acting is skilled and her appearance is also beautiful, but her eyes are too enchanting, which is inevitable excessive, and is criticized by those who know. It is said that Pan and Yu are making their debut for the first time, and it is not easy to have such achievements. As for Sun Minhou's Wang Bodang, he is Ye Shenglan in the ticket world. His singing and acting are well-established and have won a lot of applause from the audience. The fourth act is Miss Zhu ××'s June Snow. Her appearance is very beautiful, but her voice is low and narrow, which is a pity. The finale is Zhulian Village, Fan Taofu as Li Keyong, who is a famous ticket holder. The duet with Cheng Jingsi is a masterpiece, and is truly a perfect match. The audience often applauded. Zhu Boping's Cheng Jingsi has a bright and easy voice. It is heard that this gentleman has been instructed by the famous actor Yan Jupeng, which is probably not false. Sun Minjun's Grand Taibao and Xu Jifang's Second Imperial Concubine are full of wonderful performances, which add a lot of color to the play. Because it was late at night, I returned without waiting for the end of the show, and it was a pity that I did not see the whole picture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Qin ticket holders Shen Yanxi Zhu Shuping Zhongping brothers, this decision to play, the fingering is pure and sweet, and the power of the Mei school, the good cavity is full of, which is really rare, which is worth praising.</p>
<p>Yongan Music Society</p>
<h3>Will Raise Funds to Help Refugees</h3>
<p>The only noble Cantonese opera ticket office in Shanghai, "Yongan Music Society," is now stepping up rehearsals for the new thorn "Five Lakes Lovers," preparing to stage a public performance at the Golden Grand Theater from May 8th. The society plans to perform for four consecutive days, and all the proceeds from the tickets will be used to help refugees. The repertoire includes "The Legend of Jing Ke" and "Five Lakes Lovers." The Legend of Jing Ke has been tested in Dadong, and the results are excellent, and it is unanimously praised by both insiders and outsiders. All the plot, lyrics, lighting, and scenery are perfect. It is expected that the performance of Five Lakes Lovers will also have amazing results. In addition to working hard on the drama, the society has hired specialized personnel to prepare new sets, costumes, and lighting on a large scale, so that it can add a different color to the Cantonese opera scene during the public performance. Please wait and see.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (143)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>A Strange Wind Helped Li Zhuangyuan During the Palace Examination</p>
<p>The other day, because of the second play of "Thirteen Sisters," I talked about Nian Gengyao's seat master, Li Pan; To talk about the family background of Li Zhuangyuan, it is indeed very related to the word "karma" said by Buddhists. Li Pan's grandfather, Mr. Li Xiangyang, was admired by the people for his learning and morality. When Emperor Xizong of Ming Dynasty (Tianqi) was in power, the eunuch Wei Zhongxian monopolized power, and shrines were built for him everywhere, and his power was prominent. The power of the court was completely controlled by Wei Yan. At that time, Mr. Xiangyang's literary name was already known all over the world, but because he witnessed the difficulties of the time, he knew that the country's fortune was already in danger, so he lived in seclusion in his hometown and was unwilling to become an official. Wei Zhongxian admired Mr. Xiangyang's literary talent and had three resolutions to recruit him into the capital, and tempted him by saying: "As long as Mr. comes to the north, the first place in this imperial examination will definitely belong to you." Mr. Xiangyang refused all three times. From this, we can know how noble his personality is. Later, the Ming Dynasty had fallen, and he secretly plotted with Wan Nian Shao and Yan Gugu and other late Ming Dynasty remnants to restore the Ming Dynasty; However, the general trend was gone, and it could not be saved by a few people, so he, the old gentleman, also lived in seclusion with Wan. Yan and others.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiangyang's son, Li Yan, was also a learned scholar. When he had nothing to do at home, he taught his son Li Pan to study poetry. During the Kangxi period, the country was at peace, and in order to win people's hearts, the Manchus wanted to select the descendants of loyal ministers of the Ming Dynasty to become officials in the court, in order to reduce the forces of anti-Manchu restoration; Therefore, Li Pan was specially favored by them and selected as the top Zhuangyuan.</p>
<p>According to the elders in Xuzhou who have seen Li Pan's family letters, his high school that day was really too lucky. Li Pan was obese. During the palace examination, everyone else had finished their papers, but he was still kneeling there alone, writing. The more anxious he was, the more he could not write. Suddenly, he was so anxious that he was sweating and his mind was confused. He didn't even know what he had written on the paper. Unexpectedly, at this moment, a strange wind suddenly blew up, and the sky was dark; According to the past practice of the palace examination, since a considerable amount of time has passed and the paper has not been completed, the paper should be taken away and he should be driven down the palace. I don't know what kind of relationship Emperor Kangxi had with the Li family. Not only did he not take his examination paper, but he also issued an order to light red candles and set up a screen under the palace, ordering Li to complete the examination paper inside the screen before removing it. Such a rare anecdote of treating scholars with such preferential treatment is probably very rare in ancient and modern times.</p>
