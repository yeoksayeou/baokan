<h3 id="c9">美國之制日反對論 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>自今日以迄美國國會復會，曁美日商約失效，爲時俱不足兩月；在此時期，美國國內之政治爭議，殆將以對日問題爲中心。</p>
<p>美國對付日本暴行，迨美日商約失效而入重要階段。以美國現政府之態度言之，堅決而明瞭：兩年半以來，迭以牒文或口頭，作種種警告與抗議，皆屬徒然，毫無效騐。本年七月二十五日，宣吿廢止美日商約，期以六月，即自今茲再經兩月而至明年一月二十六日，商約失效。本月二十二日，由副國務卿威爾斯氏聲明，因鑒於日本不自糾正其暴行，故美國不復與之議訂新約。參議院外交委員會主席畢德門氏且已提出議案，主張授權總統，禁止軍械彈藥煤油以及各種金屬與金屬混合物，運往破壞九國公約之日本。此數者，政治措施之彰明較著者也；軍事方面之對日示意，不備舉。至於商約失效後之行動，究爲何種內容，茲不必加以推測，即以行動之所根據而論，方式亦有二別：一爲行政權之發動，即由總統頒布命令行之；一爲立法權之發動，即由國會制訂法案行之；二者或取一途，或則並用。行政權之所發動，在事實上具有偉大力量；例如寓禁於徵，效等於禁。立法權之所發動，則範圍無限制，性質尤嚴格而絕對；例如著爲法令，懸爲厲禁，且得不止於禁，立法者擁有無上權，要視其意嚮何似而已。以日本之歷久恣肆不悔，是待美國總統以果斷之命令爲對付，是誠不容緩圖，顧尤望美國國會共立膺懲之方，强調制暴之效。事關國會者，政府黨態度雖堅決而明嘹，猶不能不於反對黨之態度加以注意。</p>
<p>美國政治有民主黨與共和黨二黨互爲消長，今由民主黨之羅斯福氏以總統主持國政，共和黨在野。兩黨議政，動輒爭衡，此固政黨政治之常態　未可稱異，亦不足詬病；而關於美國之遠東政策則兩黨猶能捐棄門戶之成見，蓋其態度非在根本上相枘鑿。其間儼然別樹一幟者　有所謂孤立派。孤立派散見兩黨，在野之共和黨所屬孤立分子，以「孤立主張」與「在野身分」二重因素，態度頗固執；其中如民主黨參議員波拉氏·尤剛愎。</p>
<p>近日，波拉氏等發表談話，反對以經濟手段報復日本，謂「美國與日本之貿易，日在向前進展之中，我人不應以毫無充分之理由，　即將此項商業輕易拋棄」云。預料自今而後，以迄國會復會後之對日法案結束爲止，類於波拉之反對論將陸續而來。雖美國民意測騐所證明，民間贊成積極制裁日本者居絕大多數，反對派於理未能抗違輿情，即爲彼政治生命計，亦不敢拂逆輿情，故反對派斷難倒佔優勢；即以兩院議席而論，反對派僅居少數，未能有爲；即使對日法案頓挫於國會，亦無以阻撓賢明當局在職權範內所容許之發動行政大權；是以時機到臨，美國之所以對付日本暴行者，必見堅決而明瞭之行動。况如波拉等云云，亦非根本上容許日本暴行，而爲暴行作歪曲之辯護。然亦有足爲反對論暗中飛躍，陰謀鼓煽者；其一，利用對日問題爲政爭工具，况明年將競爭大選，尤有歪曲利用至極端惡用之可能。其二，經營對日貿易者，牟近利，牟私利，不顧遠大，不顧公道原則，尤不顧利潤之爲血爲淚。其三，日本每年揮霍鉅萬宣傳費，茲逢嚴重關頭，不致絲毫無所應騐。其四國際縱橫，頗有策士宣傳其間曰，制日則使黷武侵略者强化其勾結，將爲患愈深，不如綱開一面而懷柔之，以緩其禍。此四者，可爲甘冒不韙之反對論推皮助瀾者也</p>
<p>雖然，美國之制日反對論，行見終於幻滅而已。凡百議論，其能佔領遠大之時間空間，大衆翕服，千古不朽者無論矣；若乃僅爲一家之言，若干人始終宗信，亦必於其不健全之中，具有些些是處；彼制日反對論則無一是。即如波拉之說，旣不爲日本暴行辯護，復非主張美國接受强暴而退出遠東，顧乃消極反對經濟報復，而絕無積極之提示，以說明美國應如何應付日本暴行？美國應如何自全於遠東？此旣暴露反對論未能備具立論之必要條件。且所謂不應輕易拋棄對日商業，似爲商業利益打算；則又未打算及於目前之對華商業利益，以及他日中國抗戰制勝，從事復興建設時之遠大商業利益；此尤暴露反對論之並未精於打算。董顯光氏嘗斥波拉氏爲但見「血錢」，誠一針見血之論；夫血錢而盡利，則揆以利己主義，猶有可說，抑知供給此血錢者，方圖毀滅美國之最有大希望之另一主顧，則攫此血錢者，又與自行剜肉何異？若爲愛目前之血錢而止於剜肉，斯忍心爲之，或猶有可說；獨不聞兩旬前日人對美之咆哮乎？幾欲得美國而手縊之，惟自憾其羽毛未豐而已；助彼侵略者，助長其羽毛也，則血錢又豈僅剜肉得之，雖視血錢爲自鬻其生命而預支之代價可也。</p>

<p>莫斯科　芬蘭總理賈臣德星期五日所發表之演說、此間官方對之不願表示意見、惟蘇聯報紙則認芬蘭領袖之言論、乃完全爲虛僞者、「蓋芬蘭之反動派根本不欲與蘇聯成立何種協定、且圖向蘇挑戰也、總之、芬蘭假若繼續其反蘇聯之態度、芬蘭軍隊一日不復員之期間中、蘇聯决不願接受芬蘭之和解辦法、同時蘇聯方面對於芬蘭領袖屢以獨立爲言、殊爲不快、因蘇聯對於芬蘭、絕無危害共獨立之意思、不僅無危害其獨立之意思、且蘇方歷次所提之建議、目的皆在增進芬蘭與蘇聯之安全也（二十六日合衆社</p>

<p>確鑿證據　證明公共售煙所每日零售雅片平均達</p>
<p>三千盎斯　、價値六萬六千元、尙有許多雅片、並非售烟所賣出、而烟館所售雅片、若非購自售烟所、則恒遭稽查搜獲、而被處罰鍰、售烟所售出雅片、並無規定、亦無計核、但售烟所賣出之雅片、或有十之二三、並非南京之四十八萬人所吸食者、且南京有私售之雅片、故每日確實消耗之雅片、決不止三千盎斯而已、吸烟者、日需一元以上、始能維持、但貧困者、則每日所吸雅片、不足一元、衆信每日賣出之雅片三千盎斯、至少供六萬人吸食之、實則吸毒者總數、遠在六萬人以上、據各方報吿、可得一結論、即雅片大多來自「滿洲國」、其次爲伊朗土、由日人購買運來、至於來自安南與蘇皖北部邊界者、其數不多、「維新政府行政院」、在蘇浙皖被侵佔區內從事雅片買賣、每月經手雅片約一百萬盎期、每盎期收「稅」三元、故每月可得</p>
<p>三百萬元　之收入、據高級官員證明、每月所銷雅片數量、實遠較一百萬盎斯之數爲巨、南京月銷九萬盎斯一事、足爲此說之佐證、蓋他處吸烟之人數、較南京多十一倍有奇也、「禁烟局」推廣其分銷處、即小鎭亦設售烟所、聞地位遠較南京爲低之某城所設領有執照之烟館、已逾三百處、「維新政府」之重重支持力、實爲三百萬元之收入、中日官員均稱在目下情勢中維持任何政府、此種收入、必不可少、再、聞諸政界方面、此區統冶者之所得、非僅每盎斯三元之雅片收入而已、據某官員稱、來自大連之雅片、原價每盎斯八元、加運費二元、但躉售之價、則爲每盎斯十九元、故其中付「稅」者實達九元、「維新」某官員坦白聲稱、憲兵隊與特務部均獲一部份利益云、海洛英貿易、並無公開組織、故除憲兵及與高級管理方面接近者之外、他人未能作統計報吿、據久</p>

<p>毒物危害　之一般、（一）心地善良之某日本軍官稱、渠見靑年男女、已嗜海洛因成癮而被禁獄者、殊爲驚詫、（二）某警官負責一百三十三戶之調查事宜、其中吸毒者六十六人、該警官令此六十六人僅向售烟所購買雅片、頗爲困難、（三）官塲中人、無分高下、連同警察在內、吸毒者甚夥、（四）某敎員憤然而言云、「十年後、南京將無一良好人民矣」、（五）某警官聲稱、吸食海洛因而成餓殍者、日有二三十人、南京之目前情况、與一年前相較、有下述之變化、堪加注意、報端與街頭、今已不復發現雅片廣吿、此非因官方之羞恥心所致、即由於雅片貿易盡人皆知、無庸宜傳之故、但要道中仍懸有售烟所與烟館之脾號、當局對於吸毒者、前曾佯加取締、今則廢止、任何人能</p>
<p>隨時購買　雅片、海洛因雖稍有隱匿、但人烟稠密之某區、海洛因竟公開出售、吸食者之衆多、步可驚人、「政府」與一部份人物、今確賴毒物營業爲生、此即「東亞新秩序」歟、果爾、則中國人民今均明瞭其意義矣、否則負責者應有以糾正、筆者係基督敎徒、今以英美敎士的反毒運動之偉大傳統書此報告、須知雅片乃一種罪惡、凡從中漁利或保護此種罪惡者、實屬可恥、</p>

<p>防務空虛　僞警接替</p>
<p>日方爲支持湘桂戰事、除將在華各地之退守後方休息部隊調援一空外、並將駐吳淞·寳山·江灣·虹口·閘北·南市　自前方敗退集合之日本陸軍掃數奉調盡凈、但爲維持表面計、特將停泊黃浦江各艦之僅有海軍特別陸戰隊、調撥極少數登陸、分別接駐中央造幣廠·交通銀行倉庫·虹口司令部·吳淞砲台灣·獅子林等處、其上述該各馬路地帶、及蘇州河北各處沿河浜日哨兵崗、少數由日軍担任、次之均已由僞警接替、具見黔驢技窮、心勞日拙身、</p>
<p>嚴密戒備　搜查行人</p>
<p>自本月十九日塘山路日人朝比奈遇刦事件發生後、虹口楊樹沛一帶、施行嚴密戒備以來迄今未梢鬆懈、除於通入特殊區域各橋頭各缺口處、對往來華人施行嚴密盤查、並出動海軍陸戰隊·領事館警察、於每日傍晚、分佈各要道施行戒備、對往來華人、除搜查其全身外、並詳詢其年齡·籍貫·住址、若被日軍認爲答語與其所持之通行證不符、或通行證之照片與像貌不台時、輒遭拘捕、</p>
<p>挨戶搜查　百端騷擾</p>
<p>又據虹口來人談、前日（廿五日）下午四時、日憲兵隊員六七人、突至楊樹浦路松潘路一帶各里弄舉行挨戶搜查、但結果則一無所獲、而乘坐「華中公司汽車」之乘客、每駛至日軍崗位前、以前祇須在車中出示通行證後、即可照常行駛、但邇來則華籍乘客須一律下車、聽候盤查後、始准上車、而本月五日各要路口、曾已撤退十處之日軍崗位、現每至入晚、不特恢復原狀、且有數處、以前未駐有崗兵者、現亦添置崗位、對華籍行人、施行檢查、</p>

<p>又日軍前在靶子路北蘇州路（白波橋與四川路橋之間）裝置軍用電話後、昨日上午九時、日軍五人、復在韜朋路楊樹沛路一帶裝置軍用電話、於此可見日軍之恐慌而加緊其戒備矣、</p>

<h3 id="c71">日軍在北海登陸　目的在截斷龍邕路 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 敏</p>
<p>約翰阿煦勒著　譯自密勒評論報</p>
<p>（續）日軍自東京灣出發，目的在龍邕路，以期阻斷這「自由中國」對外交通的要道，且及時出此行動，俾阻止海防和衡陽間經過桂省的鐵路直接交通的實現。法國鐵路入雲南的地點離海岸在三百哩以上，遠非東京灣登陸的日軍所可及，但日軍一度設法侵入粵桂間山岳區而下右江流域，那末距海岸的祇一百哩的龍邕路，便難以有效的防守，邕寗本身離日軍侵佔的欽州，直錢祇七十哩。</p>
<p>從「自由中國整個經濟的觀點說來，北海欽州區和龍州邕寗區，除後者的直達交通外，在他方面無足輕重。這交通祇一小部份與廣西的經濟有關，取道龍州輸入的戰具，分給桂軍和中央軍，但龍州入口的其他貨物，幾乎全多取道柳州，桂林和貴陽入四川。廣西是個根本上貧乏的省份，經儕資源和可能性有限得很，農業和畜收雖佔要位，但形式和方法還拙劣。西江上的梧州和邕寗，有不重要的農業和製造工業，規模還小，開採的鎢砂不多，廣西的貿易和銀行業都是舊式而很不靈活的。李宗仁將軍和白崇禧將軍禁止廣西省中積聚顯著範圍的資金，廣西貨幣常可鉅量的獲得，以供軍用；而用於任何種新商業投資的款項，幾乎沒有。</p>
<p>廣西資金的缺乏，使中政府逐漸擊破該省的孤立和自主的努力，得順利進行。這次中日戰爭爆發，中政府立即藉信用放款和其他金融上的援助，而開始在經濟上伸入廣西，中政麻四銀行認購廣西公債一千七百萬元，這筆收入，用作廣西紙幣的準備金。法幣的流通額逐漸散佈廣西各地，人民現已漸照法幣一元合桂幣二元的官價接受，政府各銀行還協助廣西另二批各一千五百萬元公債的發行，並在廣西較大的城市設分銀行。至於建迭廣西新鐵路，省方祇供給不熟練的勞工，他如經費，鐵軌火車和工程師，都由中政府供給。中政府並出資建造龍邕路和捂州到新都（譯音）的公路，中央農務局以農村借款五百萬元貸予廣西農民，本年並撥出二百萬元，供西江區灌漑計劃之用。近來中政府撥款在廣西實行的工業計劃中，最傑出的是在未經披露的地方，建築現代的大煉糖廠。</p>
<p>然而廣西在經濟上還是落後的省份，與「自由中國」新經濟發展相接觸的程度，遠不及四川等省。廣西軍力强盛，日軍進犯，將有激戰，但廣西旣比較的貧乏，日軍獲得任何重要戰利品的希望，便也渺小。在這些情勢之下，日軍若能達到攫佔或阻斷龍邕公路的目的，大槪將就此滿足了。（完）</p>

<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>米價亟應平衡，已爲全體市民一致的呼聲。目前需要的，是一個切實有效的辦法。用敢略陳一得之愚，供各界參考。</p>
<p>疏通來源</p>
<p>供需失調，奸商乃乘機操縱，故一般人主張疏通來源；來源通，米價自平；此點目無非議之處。但在目前，此項主張，幾與增加生產，同屬高調。要知日偽阻攪來源，原欲危害上海市民生計。旣不能與虎謀皮，又不可俟之抗戰勝利以後。故唯有利用日僞必需不斷敲索以維持其收入之弱點，庶可達成淪陷區內米產之源源來滬。此辦法爲何？惟有採取破釜沉舟之决心，實行聯合採辦或聯合停止採辦之辦法。此則有待於强有力之組織。</p>
<p>公會制度</p>
<p>政府勢力遠離滬上，因此一般人咸主將統制權交給各同業公會。要知同業公會，原係自由經濟之組織。其主旨在謀同業之利益。然所謂利益，與投機同，可分現貨及期貨兩種。捨現利而求遠利，非具遠識者不辦；更非一般普通商人所能瞭解；而統制經濟之利益，大都屬於期貨，公會父無强制同業執行法令之權力。故事實上公會無統制米價之能力明甚。</p>
<p>租界當局</p>
<p>目前之租界當局，應辦之事固甚多，但有關民食之米價，實與警衛工作同等重要；此不單爲社會治安着想，同時亦爲社會經濟之繁榮着想。因米貴則百物更貴，而一般購買力則更跌。長此以往，目前之繁榮勢必破產；此在日僞，正求之不得者也。公會旣無力統制米價，能者惟兩租界之當局；况米价之回平與否，又與租界安全租界權益有如上之密切關係，更不容忽視。</p>
<p>實事求是</p>
<p>曾有人請求租界設倉儲糧，此係高調，且反授奸商乘機操縱之藉口。蓋所謂投鼠忌器，打草驚蛇之故也。况事實上，租界內儘有倉庫可用，不必另起爐灶。而且確知現有存糧，亦儘足支持四五個月；更不必慌張若此。目前之問題：</p>
<p>（一）强制米價回平，此則必先統制有米而後　可。</p>
<p>(二）維持存底定額，必需厲行聯合採辦而後　可。</p>
<p>（三）根絕奸商操縱，必需重行改造米市而後　可。</p>
<p>故作者曾在某種機會上，建議「檢查存倉」一公定米價」「統一採運」及實施「米業許可制度」並皆須由租界當局聘請公正人士，特設委員會辦理之。</p>
<p>檢查存倉</p>
<p>不特爲調劑糧食供需上必要，且爲檢舉操縱米價之奸商而後加以膺懲之最有效辦法。故檢查之目的在此，存米額雖多，亦毋需發表。統制米價之當局，應對全體市民負責者，爲公定價格之維持，及如何維持公定價格。若以存額如何如何多而作穩定人心之計，則又犯打草驚蛇之病。過去之發表存米數所以適爲奸商造空氣者蓋在此。檢查存倉之辦法爲：</p>
<p>（一）通令全市米商及倉庫業主，於十天內將存米數就實陳報租界當局而登記之。逾期即拒絕登記。</p>
<p>（二）在登記及檢查期間，不得遷移存米，但規定每家米商得以出棧應市之數目。</p>
<p>（三）登記完竣，即開始檢查。凡少報者，即沒收其超過登記數以上之存米，作爲平糶；或作爲公倉之存底。</p>
<p>公定米價</p>
<p>限價制度，弊在太固定，易於不適於實際。且市價一與限價接近，人心便慌。奸商便可乘機活動。故今後應改採公定米價制度。公定米價，目前毋須願全來價。因米價之貴，實爲奸商與日僞互爲因果而造成。此點在上期本刊過去一週內已詳釋之，茲不復贅。總之：每担米十四元，決不過低。囤積之徒，因貴進而虧蝕，實亦罪有應得。上海之公定米價旣低，日偽之敲索乃亦自有其限度。惟實施公定米價，而無强制出售及聯合採辦爲後盾，尙不能維。</p>
<p>强制出售</p>
<p>故必須將檢查所得之存米額，按市塲實需額作比例分配各家出售之數。並强制執行。惟在比例分配出售量時，亦不妨考查其平日之賬目而求一平均之交易額，而辦理之。</p>
<p>聯合採辦</p>
<p>危害上海市民之生計，為日偽阻難運米來滬理由之一。然彼亦有非放米出口以取得敲索收入不可之弱點。惟在自由採辦時，彼等乃可逐個要挟，隨心所欲。於是來價參差，米價即有增無减。然在統一採辦時，彼即不能再施其慣技。在實施之初，彼等必實行留難。但吾人應抱破釜沉舟之決心，寗吃價貴之洋米，而絕不屈服。即屈服者必爲日偽而非本市。因淪陷區內米產，目前惟有運滬之一途。日方搜購，亦不外乎來滬轉售於華商。運回日本，或移充日本軍糧云云，盡屬奸商捏造，可以日本關冊為證。設上海不去進米，淪陷區內農民將因此而蠢動。此非日僞所樂聞，况彼等無敲索收入，更不能忍耐。吾人旣有此決心，則以目前存米實情而論，尙不致立刻非吃價貴洋米不可。即有必要，亦在四五個月之後。恐日僞在此期間巳不能堅持而即屈服矣。</p>
<p>特許制度</p>
<p>上項辦法，亦決不能以米商之反對或不合作而停止。如發生此種情勢，不妨取消其營業權；而實施特許制度。將全市米業，特許若干商家辦理。此項辦法，雖有獨佔危險；但在公定米價下，亦決無問題。如今日之水電，幸係獨佔企業，故市民尙未受無情漲價之壓迫。</p>
<p>消費合作</p>
<p>上項辦法，應迅速進行，但座租界當局能否採行？或有問題。故吾人亦應有所準備，以防租界當局之萬一不能辦理。此項準備最有效之辦法，莫如各界迅速辦理消費合作。辦法爲：</p>
<p>各大商號廠家或學校機關團體，立即辦理全體員工的聯合採辦合作。此項聯合採辦，應直接向產地進行。進國米也好，進洋米也好，惟有直接採辦，始可避免奸商之上下其手。然個人決難單獨進行。</p>
<p>惟員工收入有限，聯合採辦不無受現款限制；此則有待於資方等當局之明理，而相互合作矣。要知與其因米貴而發給米貼，或應付增加工資之要求；不如協助員工聯合採辦，庶可穩定米價而一勞永逸也。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c103">上海民族工業應否維持 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>八一三戰事爆發，上海和蘇浙一帶的民族工業，在飛機大砲中摧毀大半。當時政府鑒於局勢前途，未可逆覩，故策動沿海工廠內移，預備在西南西北重行建設，藉以保全實力，增强抗戳。不料二十六年十一月，戰局驟變，戰綫西移，這時上海和京滬沿綫的工廠，尙有一部份沒有遷完。兵慌馬亂，交通阻梗，如把笨重的設備，繞道香港內遷，幾成爲不可能的事。故與其把拆下的機器，遷運內地，不如在內地另起爐灶，重行建設，來得合算。同時維持員工生計，保持原有市塲，不得不收拾殘燼，遷避上海租界，設法局部開工。這種兵燹餘生重振旗鼓的工廠，占戰後上海工業的大部份。二十七年春季以後，國幣滙價下落，物價騰張，後方機製品的銷路，去胃頗旺；同時香港及南洋各埠，因抵制日貨關係，也消納了大批的國貨。這時上海人口也陡增，需要通漸大。在這有利形勢之下，造成國貨供不應求的現象。利之所在，人必趨之，在這一年內，新設小工廠，如雨後春筍。且大致均有盈餘；這樣，構成工業的小康局面。統計截至二十七年年底止，上海租界內的工廠數，已達四千七百餘家，超出戰前二倍以上，比戰前全市的廠數，相差祇八百餘家。</p>
<p>當前的困難</p>
<p>上海國貨工廠的出品，除供給租界內民衆消費，並運銷南洋各埠外，大部份以後方為主要銷地。雖然國貨的原料，因地域性的限制，一部份不得不仰給舶來，但設廠的資本，和製造的人工，都係國人所有。所以後方購用滬廠產品，較諸購買純粹的外國貨，約可節省三成以上的外匯。在這種觀點之下，目前上海的國貨工廠，似有維持的必要。政府西遷，雖然一時權力不能達到上海，然而特區內的民族工業，祇要主持者忠貞自矢，保持節操，依舊是我們的生產力量；决沒有民心堅信而政府先予捨棄的道理。二年以來，經濟行政當局始終抱定這個立塲，對於上海工廠的聲請註册證明等案件，都能認眞審查，切實批覆，確値得我們的歌誦。可是另一方面，一年來上海工業界正遭遇着很大的困難：第一，是內地滙款至口岸問題：第二，是資金接濟問題。</p>
<p>先說匯款問題。上海各工廠所以有由後方滙款至口岸的需要，發生於下列二件事實：（一）在後方已經設立分廠，或正在建設分廠者，須由後方滙款至滬港，以備採辦原料，添置設備，並支付運費。這種需要，恐怕後方各廠，運國營工廠在內，都有的。（二）上海的工廠，把產品運銷內地後，所得的貨款，必須匯還滬廠，以備採購原料，支付薪資運費，維持工廠的不斷週轉。可是自從政府加嚴統制外匯後，財政常局爲防止資金逃避，嚴厲限制國幣滙至口岸，中中交農內地各行，每天承做滬港匯款，爲數極小，逾額即無理由地拒絕承滙。重慶等埠，往往有人欲滙百元法幣到上海，黎明候至中午，一連數日，均遭璧返者。至於商業銀行，雖在某種限額以內，可以承匯；但滙費之大，駭人聽聞。在這種情形之下，內地的工廠欲在口岸購辦原料機器，支付必要的運費，固然無法進行；就是上海的工廠欲把在內地售貨所得的款子匯還滬廠，繼續生產，接濟後方，也成爲不可能。財政當局這種因噎廢食的辦法，我們認爲有重行考量，設法改善的必要。良以內地的工廠，如果一部或全部須用外國原料者，一旦接濟斷絕，當然祇好關門。新設的工廠，不能在口岸購置設備，只得中止建設。在上海的工廠如果貨款不能運滬，也只能縮减產量，另謀抵補。推衍所至，勢必造成內地機製品價格的飛漲，甚至斷絕供給，使人民生活更形惡化，或逕被外國貨乘機而入，也非不可能。</p>
<p>其次是資金接濟問題。上海在八一三後，銀行存款數和庫存數，據統計較戰前增加很多。在需要一方面，一部份工業已被砲火毀滅，故放款的對手减少了。上海附近各處的土產品，受着日人的統制，不能自由運銷；進口的洋貨，因需要激减，也示降低；所以銀行的商品放款，也减少很多。道樣，資金供過於求，內容殷實，營業正當的工業，循理應該可以得着充裕的資余供給；可是一考事實，却是不然，儘管銀行資金呆藏不用，聯合凖備委員會的新滙劃五千萬元，領用不到半數，而各銀行對於工廠放款，在財部馬電限制提存以後，都是竭力收縮，避之若凂；據說甚至原已訂有透支契的者，也被中途停止通融。工業界在這種壓迫之下，所受苦痛，不難臆度。而返視投機市塲，自歐戰發生後，競套外匯以外，購貨囤存，妄冀居奇牟利者，比比皆是，尤以金融界從業人士爲多。這種損人利己的手段，我們不禁爲國民心理墮落扼腕；何况利己兩宇，大部份還是望梅止渴罷了。查財部馬電原意，在於遏抑投機；現在投機沒有絕跡，而工業先遭摧毀；恐也出乎當局意料之外吧。</p>
<p>孤島工業的本質</p>
<p>現階段上海民族工業，政府應否加以維護？這一問題的答案，應該先把上海工廠目前的內容和產銷狀况對於我國政治上經濟上所生的影響，爲利爲害，加以檢討後，再下斷語。先說生產方面：第一，原料一項，也許大部份的工廠，受地域性的限制，不免一部或全部仰賴外貨，祇要不用日貨，我們認爲這種購用外國原料自己加工製造的辦法，在過渡時期，未始不可以容許。因爲我國土產，受先天性的限制，故各工廠在戰前已經如此，何况目前大部份出產原料的國土，都已淪陷。在這一方面，固然每年須輸入大批原料；但比全部輸入外國製成品，總要合算得多。第二是資本。我們可以斷言：凡是國人所辦的工廠，都是純粹的國人資本，與外人合資的絕少。第三是人工。目前上海的國貨工廠，可以說都是中國人工，並由國人經理，連外籍技師也很少見。再從反面着想，如果這些工廠都停止生產，那末幾萬員工的失業，豈非成爲極嚴重的社會問題。第四是土地。在上海特區內開工的工廠，廠基廠房，受租界警權的保護，尚能維持超然的地位，不受任何人的染指。</p>
<p>再說銷路方面：目前上海國貨工廠出品的銷地，約爲下列幾處：第一，後方內地。日用的機製品，爲後方軍民生活所必需，每年消費，爲數很鉅。在西南西北各省工業建設完成以是利用上海特區有利的生產條件，巷後方軍民製造生活用品，替政府節省鉅額外匯，實屬未可厚非。第二，香港和南洋各埠，國幣匯價下跌以後，有利於輸出貿易，香港南洋各埠，大部份的人口，都是華僑，他們激於愛國情緒，年來抵制日貨，改購國貨，因此消納了大批的滬廠製品，使我國國際收支，增加一部份外幣收入，同時奠定國貨南銷的市塲，相對的削弱敵人的貿易勢力。第三，上海特區和各淪陷區。上海特區四百餘萬人口的消費，應由國貨接濟，毋待再述。現在要研究的是，各淪陷區在可能的條件之下，國貨應否運往行銷？目前各淪陷地帶的民衆，除極少數爲虎作倀的分子外，其餘都是「身處江湖，心繫魏闕」的人。所以可以說，地雖淪陷，而民衆仍舊是我們的。有了這種前提，當然應當容許國貨運銷供應，以免劣貨的越俎代庖；只要內地的運銷機構組織健全，上海的國貨工廠監視嚴密，可以防杜資敵的危險。這一件事的需要，我們只要從反面着想，就可察覺。假定國貨禁止運往各戰區後，那末不特流動部隊和一般民眾由於買不到國貨以供消費的結果，徒然替日貨造成傾銷的機會，並且足以减弱民衆愛國的熱忱。所以照現階段的淪陷區看來，我們找不出充分的理由，禁止國貨運往銷售。</p>
<p>綜括以上的分析，上海特區內民族工業的存在，對於國民經濟似乎還是利多害少，不容抹煞。那末政府對於各廠目前的困難，應當予以有力的救濟，也是當然的事。</p>
<p>救濟辦法的建議</p>
<p>救濟上海民族工業的辦法，當然應針對目前的困難，對症發藥，扼要言之，可分：</p>
<p>第一，由中央財政經濟行政當局推派負責人員，來滬會同各公共團體，調查各廠產銷現狀，和內部組織，以明瞭內容眞相。</p>
<p>第二，由中央財政當局督飭四行聯合辦事總處，通飭內地及上海各該行處對於前項鑑定工廠之聲請申匯，具有確切證明者，儘量承做，並實施財政部核定之「便利內滙暫行辦法」，以策週密。</p>
<p>第二，由中央財政當局令飭四行貼放委員會擴大上海工業貼放額；鼓勵各商業銀行聯合辦理工業放款，或組織工業貸款銀團，承貸內容殷實而有確實担保品之工廠放款；一面令四行貼放委員會及上海銀行業聯合凖備委員會以轉抵押方式，爲商業銀行後盾。這樣使資金得到正當的運用機會，或可减殺投機的活動。</p>
<p>上述三項，都是希望政府策動辦理的。凡事欲取得他人之同情援助，必須自己先有健全的組織，足以公開的內容，和忠貞的民族觀念。我們殷切盼望上海各工廠保持節操，堅貞淬勵，整飭內部，爲增强民族經濟力量而奮鬥。同時爲昭示大公起見，我們建議從速自動辦理</p>
<p>第一　組織工業聯合團體，並請四聯總處，商會銀行公會，及各業專家共同參加，以超然之地位，常川辦理調查鑑定各廠內容，產銷實况等事務，以供政府和金融界的諮詢。會員入會資格，必須嚴格，寗缺母濫，以免流弊。有了這樣的機構存在，那末辦理申匯和放款方面的審查工作時，或可便利得多。</p>
<p>第二　上海各工廠運銷香港和南洋各埠貨品按照財政部出口貨結售外滙辦法，向中中交農內行結售外滙，以增政府外滙收入。</p>
<p>總之：抗戰決勝，國力第一；在政府方面，與其消極的放任特區工廠自生自滅，視同化外，或竟逼其走險，不如積極的從嚴監督，予以扶植，以保持國家元氣，增强抗建實力。（完）</p>

<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>讀上期（十一月二十日）本刊陳亮君「物質利用」一文，所談破舊物品，一經改製，便可成爲有用，在此非常時期，尤其是薪給階級的人們，進益泰半折减，所謂量入爲出，化敝舊之物，爲有用之品，確於經濟有所補助，陳君誠為有心人，現在鄙人亦想出數件發棄物品，加以改制，即能適用，以作續貂，投寄本刋。。</p>
<p>寫舊的毛筆已無筆鋒，泰半投入字紙簏去，很爲可惜！不妨積聚十枝八枝，筆頭用淸水漂凈，排齊用細繩紮緊，即成排一筆，（亦稱板筆）可以蘸了漿糊糊房間窗牖之用。</p>
<p>凡破舊衣服和襪子等，不能冉穿時，可拿來去其鈕扣鑲條等，洗凈晒亁，疊齊糊作「布版」，為小孩墊作鞋底之用。再不然撕成布條，紥在圓木棍上，便成拖帚，因拖帚拖拭地板，磨擦旣重，極易破壞，可將敝衣舊襪，再番更換，不必常買拖帶了。</p>
<p>日曆每年一換，換時舊的隨手棄去，也覺可惜！何妨將它空白的反面，寫寫便條，或者練練字，其功用不在扯紙簿下，至於自來火梗劃過後，削尖燃過的一端，可充牙籤，有人認爲有毒質：其實用淸水浸一二日後，待乾，毒質便也消除可用了。更有上等雪茄烟灰，據說可擦牙齒，銹杳烟罐鑿細孔，裝扦可以澆花，（新的爲用更多）其他什用器皿，略有損壞，可補則補，可修則修，總以節省經濟爲原則，旣養成惜物的好習慣，更其是度過艱苦的非常時期的要着哩。</p>
<h3 id="c110">絨綫復染法 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 范學暉</p>
<p>天冷了，又是制寒衣的季節。絨綫已成為我國國民普遍的禦寒製品，差不多每個兒童和成人都有一件絨綫內衣或外衣，尤其是娘兒們。</p>
<p>不過在此外匯緊縮，物價飛漲的時候，我們不得不節省一下。今將舊絨綫復染法貢獻給主婦們。</p>
<p>灰色：最宜復染深灰或元色，可以酸性元二錢或一兩。</p>
<p>淡黄：最宜復染金黄，羣綠，咖啡，墨綠等，染金黄可以用酸性桃紅五錢，染翠綠可用翠綠顏料五錢，染深咖啡可以酸性元及酸性鼻烟拼合而染。若染墨綠可用品藍五錢。</p>
<p>淡綠：最宜復染藏靑，可用酸性品藍八錢，酸性元色二錢，酸性硃紅二錢拼合而染之。</p>
<p>大紅：最宜復染紫醬，可用酸性元色三錢，酸性大紅七錢拼合而染。此外亦可改染藏靑。</p>
<p>其他如荳沙，亦可復染深咖啡或藏靑。</p>
<p>以上顏料配置，按照絨綫十兩計算。</p>
<p>染法，先將絨綫用熱水浸透。顏料用磁杯或碗用沸水化烊，置入鍋內，或面盆，並須在鍋中放置相當水量，再將顏料液注入鍋中，然後將絨綫亦置入鍋中，置在爐上，徐徐翻動，使熱度平均，煮半小時，染時若能加冰形醋少許尤佳。</p>
<p>取出之後，將顏料水洗淸，其色澤即可鮮艷不退。</p>

<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>飛機在空中飛行，誰都覺得這是一樁極平常的事，可是人在空中「走路」，這恐怕還有許多人不知道吧！飛機只能够載人，因爲有引擎的裝置，行動並不能隨心所欲，稱心如意，人類早已明瞭，道是飛機的缺點，科學家的頭腦尤其尖銳，他們曾悉心研究過，逐地改良過—空中「行」的發明，名稱呌「飄行機」或者呌滑翔機，這裏，我就來介紹它。</p>
<p>趁坐過飛機的人總會覺得吧—高空中飛行，地面上的一切都是模糊的，但是「飄行機」却不然了，它可以在你頭上離地面七十呎的空中滑翔，一忽兒可以來，一忽兒可以去，假使你在揀擇一件東西偶爾回一下身的話，你面前的東西一下子竟會不翼而飛的，靠「飄行機」在空中行走的人眞是仙人，眞是魔王，這話，我並不胡說，因爲歐洲大陸上早已拿這樣機械做「競賽」的玩意兒了。</p>
<p>「飄行機」的構造非常簡單，沒有引擎，所以不需要汽油的消耗，用鋼管或木料製成幾根骨架，再裝上兩扇狹而長的翼子就成了。它憑藉汽車拖行的力量，飛機升空的力量，絞索發動的力量，就能昇在很高的空中，但是不久它脫除了人家的帮助，能隨氣流的飄盪，悠悠地在空中行走，並無危險，降落地面時也很緩和的。英國有一個年紀只有十歲的童子尙且趁坐這玩藝兒，何况大人呢。像中國的泰山，衡山，以及其它風景區內的高山頂上，放幾架「飄行機」遊客趁坐下山，這是多麼便利而經濟的事啊！</p>
<p>它在空中行走，亦可變換方向，坐墊的後面裝一個舵，人在前面撥舵，它就迎合你意思走了。</p>

<p>— 朱燁醫師</p>
<p>肝油　早期即與嬰兒以肝油為佳，自少量開始，至第四個月，一日約與以三茶匙，或自二滴漸次增量至十滴，據Ｄｒ．Ｍａｒｔｈａ　Ｅｌｉｏｔ氏谓自生後第三星期起，一日二次，一次半茶匙，第二個月一茶匙，一日二次，第三個月一茶匙半，一日二次，此量可持續二年之久，肝油亦可如於牛乳或橘子汁中，以免腥臭難服。乳兒對於肝油之耐容力強大，故有佝僂病傾向之乳兒，早產兒，營養障碍等之嬰兒，尤宜早期服之。</p>
<p>蔬菜湯　蔬菜湯中尙須另加肉類，穀類等，例如靑菜中加切碎之牛肉，羊肉，或雞肉等少許，馬鈴薯一個，籮蔔一個，米二食匙，食鹽少許，加水煮三小時，有時加蕃茄，豌豆等亦佳，此蔬菜湯自第六個月開始，於午後二時哺乳時，與以二食匙，牛乳亦减量三食匙，漸决增加至三十食匙。</p>
<p>蔬菜羹　以靑菜煮成肉菜羹狀與之，如已食蔬菜湯者，則此蔬菜羹目第十一個月左右與之，否則僅食蔬菜羹者，可於第六個月開始，午後二時哺乳時服此，最初一星期三次，與以菠菜，其他四日則與以紅籮蔔，豌豆，龍鬚菜，萵苣等，一次一茶匙，斬增量至第七個月爲一食匙，第八個月止為二食匙，第九個月止為三食匙，以後持續以三食匙，一年後可與以南瓜，白籮蔔，大頭菜，捲心菜等，每次二三種以上混和食之爲佳，煮蔬菜之水中含有貴重之鹽分，不可棄去，牛油半茶匙與蔬菜羹一食匙混食，不但蔬菜羹之味美，其營養價亦增高。</p>
<p>肉汁　培牛肉半磅，切碎，以肉汁器壓榨而取其汁，加少量食鹽，自第五個月或第九個月開始，一日一茶匙，漸增量至三食匙至六食匙。貧血兒可稍早期與之，有時嬰兒對於肉汁容力較強之故，而起興奮不眠時，可暫中止。</p>
<p>蛋　先與以蛋黄，普通目第五個月開始，半熟或全熟均可，最初可混於橘子汁或牛乳中，午後二時哺乳時與之，俟蛋黄完全習慣後，始與以極少量蛋白，至第十三十四個月時與以全蛋</p>
<p>麵包　嬰兒生齒後始與之，先與以烘麵包，或乳酪餅干。</p>
<p>果物　嬰兒以食蘋果爲最宜，始目第十個月，煮蘋果或煮後濾過者均可，與牛乳等同時服用，香蕉則始自第十三四個月。</p>
<p>以上爲嬰兒各種「添食」之大要，但至患病時或特殊情形者，則須經醫師指導後，始可與之</p>

<h3 id="c115">角票慌 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>（一）黃自強</p>
<p>分幣的恐慌直到現在還沒有全部解決，却進一步地又發生角票恐慌了。收買銅元和分幣是有厚利可圖，短視的商人就爲虎作倀，使「孤島」呈現了一時混亂的局面。現在的角票慌，原因當然不止如此簡單，可是從中漁利，倒亂市塲，却是更甚於分幣慌時期。</p>
<p>最使人感到不便利的是小菜塲，烟兌店和醫園等的零星交易。沒有分幣零找的時期，即使購買蔬菜，也得起碼一角，這無形提高生活程度，是使一般平民的生活更形艱苦。可是現在，小菜塲上竟然要無法做賣買了。魚腥的攤子上，交易較大，魚販子都早已兌進一些角票來維持營業，但也是一元作九角三分至九角七分不等。其他的蔬菜小攤，因爲沒有較大的資本事前兌進角票，他一們祇能望着顧客授上來的鈔票一而搖搖頭，這些博取蠅頭之利的小販，倒是損失最重。</p>
<p>上海烟兌店的「精括」，是人所共知的。中央分幣券發行的時候，一元錢的貼水最大的要收一角，現在購物不滿五角的，也至少要收五分至七分的貼水，如果祇是幾分至一角的交易，那就老實不客氣地「擋駕」，因爲烟兌店襄出買的物品，都是居家日常所不可少的日用品，他們是不怕生意落空的。</p>
<p>黃包車夫也是受到最大影饗的階級。因爲生活程度提高，普通坐黃包車的都降而乘坐電車了，現在電車賣票在高喊「沒有角幣的請勿上來」，坐黃包車的主顧自然更形减少了。</p>
<p>至於一切點心吃食店，門口都巳掛上了「不滿五角貼水三分」的招貼。據他們說：他們去收兌的時候，都是貼上五分至七分不等呢。不過羊毛出在羊身上，最後受到損失的還是一般顧客。</p>
<p>所以，角幣慌的影響是更甚於分幣慌，因爲受剝削最大的也是最貧苦的市民。</p>
<p>（二）　西蒙</p>
<p>……不過有的商人手頭還是有着不少角票，正在沒有去路。前天我云喊一擔煤球，拿出一張十元的鈔票，煤球店老闆就要求我搭兩元錢角票，我當然歡迎。據他說煤球店門市做下的零碎生意，全是一角兩角居多，所以積有不少角票，並歡迎我下决去問他們兌換。可知角票並不缺少，祇是供求不當，有地方多，有地方少而已。（編者：或許是這家煤球店老闆的消息不靈通，現在他大概在後悔無形損失了這兩元錢角票上的貼水呢。）</p>
<p>據說這决角票的所以缺少，原因很多：奮有的破爛角票是收回了，新的發行額目前還抵不上舊的多；流入淪陷區域的數字很高；而有人更在收兌，蓄意倒亂市塲，希望貼水大了可以賺錢，也是一大原因。誠然如此，那麼我們惟有希望金融界能够速籌妥當的對策，以减少市民購物的不便。</p>
<h3 id="c116">體罰制度之淘汰與除名制度之亟應廢止 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 柳子</p>
<p>偶然與幾個友人談起學校對於學生的除名問題。在戰前，有好多較著名的中等以上學校，曾雷厲風行的執施過這種制度，而引起了社會人士對於這問題的研討；在戰後，淪爲孤島的上海，這問題就很淡然置之了；雖然在一些日子之前，某報也曾一度又討論過，但不久好像仍是莫衷一是。近來有幾個著名學校，爲了整飭風紀，仍擬厲行除名制度，我們因而認爲這是一個亟應解決而不容忽視的敎育問題。</p>
<p>我個人的見解，認爲這制度是絕對不合教育原理的。普通學校對於學生之除名，不外功課惡劣，操行不良兩者。前者我認為學校儘可以留級來代替，何必令其感受失學的痛苦；後者我覺得亦殊不合理，試想學生的行為卑劣，正是教育的失敗，而敎育家與學校當軸之所應引咎自責；教育本爲學生增進學業敦修品行而設，也就是敎育家所應負起的最大使命。因爲一個不良的學生，難道永遠就讓他不良下去嗎？還是把責任推諉到他人身上去呢？如若是因爲愛護一己或一校的榮譽，而忍心地看着這些墮落的學生一直墮落下去，非但不一加奧援，反下井投石，此則固所不該；如若說是爲了怕少數的害羣之馬帶壞了多數的學生。此語亦殊嫌偏窄，試想：何不設法使此少數劣等生爲多數的良好學生感化，而反恐因少累多，這也非理敎育者所應有之口吻吧？在過去，曾一致反對體罰制度，認爲對學生施以夏楚，太不合敎育原理，我覺得對學生的除名較諸體罰，尤不合理·因爲學生如一經除名，則簡直連改過自新的機會都予以剝奪了。</p>
<p>前省立鎭江師範校長曹漱逸氏就堅決反對除名制度，他認爲應對於學生循循善誘，令其自覺自新，其結果頗著成效，彼時該校風紀極爲良好，此即一例。因此，我覺得學校對於學生的除名制度亟應廢止，當與昔日之體罰制度同入淘汰之列，質</p>

<p>第十八回　談經濟繁榮與舊市　述婚姻掠奪溯遺風</p>
<p>從蘇州到上海，還是乘客最多的一段，所以蘇州車站上，看乘客的多少，往往預備一兩節車在那裏。只要火車一來，掛在後面，便可以開行了。吳君素在蘇滬往來得多，知道這個規矩，便領着她們幾位直趨定備車而來。此刻火車是對號入座的，她們六個人，又是在一處買的票，都是聯號，自然也都是坐在一處。因爲人多了，更覺得加添了興味。一刻兒工夫，這定備車裏的座位也坐滿了。來的火車也進了車站了，把她們所坐的定備車，接了上去，也就開了。她們在車廂中談談說說，一回兒，便講到何家兩姊妹，到自由村開織綢廠的事。邵慧華便極力贊成，說道：『對啦！爲什麼開工廠，大家都要擠到上海去呢？我記得在民國二十八九年的時候，正是中日戰爭的當兒，那時上海還有租界。那兩個租界裏的人口，說是總共有四百五十萬。我那時年紀還小，本來我們是住在北平，後來逃難也逃到上海。到了上海，第一件苦事，就找不到房子。只得一面住旅館，一面便云尋房子。好容易有位親戚，介紹我們一所三層樓的小洋房，說是那房主人要到昆明去了，願意把房子頂給人家。我媽去接洽了，那房價平常是每月六十五元，現在漲到一百十五元了。那倒不去管它，無論如何，總比住旅館省得多。及至一問頂費，可嚇人一跳，他們却要三千元。三千元頂些什麽呢？一個電話，幾盞電燈，還有幾張破檯子，破桌子，就只幾件東西罷了。後來一打聽，並非是那個房主人要到什麼昆明去。簡直他也是頂來的，不過他的頂費，比現在的價目，便宜得多。他是不到一千塊錢頂進來的，至多出了兩個月空房錢，就賺了兩千多塊錢，他就借此在做生意。當時在國難的當兒，有許多人趁此發財的，便呌做「發國難財」，這也算是發國難財之一吧？』吳君素是最性急的人，便問道：『後來怎樣呢？你們借到房子嗎？當時那種逃難時代，我們大家都經過。也許何家兩位姐姐，從小到外國，不曾經過。這種時代，我父親和我談起時　，還說是大時代。因爲這時候，歐戰又起，全世界都在亂動咧。』（二〇七）</p>

<p>Guilin: The fighting near Nanning is extremely fierce. The morale of the Chinese soldiers is very high. Under constant bombing by Japanese aircraft, they engage in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese, inflicting extraordinarily heavy casualties on the enemy. A certain commander has personally gone to the front lines to take command, further boosting morale. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: Japanese troops who forcibly crossed the river near Siyan Tang have been ambushed by Chinese forces in the mountains and at Fengling, suffering heavy casualties. A portion of the Japanese forces broke through and fled to the vicinity of Nanning, where fierce fighting is underway. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The major battle near Nanning has gradually unfolded. The Chinese army and people are extremely encouraged and have completely cleared the fields and abandoned houses. Mobile units have been attacking Japanese communication lines for days, and all routes are now under Chinese control. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The report of the fall of Nanning has not yet been confirmed. According to recent military dispatches from the front in Guangxi Province, fierce fighting is currently taking place in the suburbs of Nanning. A unit of Japanese troops, on the morning of November 23rd, passed through the gap between Yangshan (transliteration) and the Shiwan (100,000) Mountains, reaching the outskirts of Nanning. On the same day, Japanese aircraft and heavy artillery heavily bombarded the city, covering their troops as they crossed the Yu River. It is claimed that the Japanese advance troops were once driven back to the south bank, but later, reinforced by three divisions of fresh troops, they finally crossed the river again under the cover of a large number of Japanese aircraft in the evening of the same day. Chinese troops firmly defended the eastern suburb positions, and the two armies repeatedly charged and counter-charged in the western suburbs of the city. The positions were lost and regained as many as eight times. Casualties on both sides were very heavy. The Guilin Chinese Army Headquarters has just issued a notice urging the public not to be alarmed by the situation in Nanning, stating that this is only one stage in a carefully prepared plan, and the battle will inevitably have new developments.

<p>Liuzhou: Nanning city and its surroundings have been repeatedly and fiercely bombed by Japanese aircraft for days, resulting in large fires. Telephone lines between Liuzhou and Nanning are down. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to sources here, although Japanese troops have crossed the Yu River and penetrated deep into Guangxi, Chinese troops are still continuing to fight in northern Nanning. The Japanese rear is constantly under attack by Chinese guerrillas. (26th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: Japanese infantry and cavalry, consisting of approximately three regiments, under the cover of numerous aircraft, invaded the south bank of the Yu River in three routes, reaching Tingziwei, Liangqingwei, and Pumiao on the 22nd. Starting at dawn on the 23rd, they continuously bombed the riverbank area with large formations of aircraft, covering the infantry as they crossed the river. They were repeatedly repulsed by the valiant defending Chinese troops. Until 4:00 PM on the 24th, approximately one battalion of Japanese infantry forcibly crossed the river at Dakengkou and fiercely attacked Yong City. Two other Japanese battalions forcibly crossed the river at Siyan Tang and launched a fierce attack. The defending Chinese troops fought bravely in bloody battles, repeatedly engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Casualties on both sides were heavy. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Guangxi dispatches state that confused fighting is occurring near Yongning (Nanning), but details are unclear. Military experts believe that the Guangxi authorities have made clever arrangements, and their military strength is sufficient to block the Japanese advance. Moreover, the Guangxi mountains are crisscrossed, making it difficult for the Japanese to maintain contact with their rear, and they are bound to suffer a major setback. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: General Chen Cheng, Political Minister of the Military Affairs Commission, gave a speech yesterday to six patriotic cultural organizations here, stating that the Japanese invasion of Guangxi is advantageous to the Chinese army, as it further lengthens the Japanese front lines. He also stated that time is an important factor in determining modern warfare, and anyone unable to wage a war of attrition will eventually fail. Because time is an important factor, the longer we fight, the stronger we become. At the same time, the wider the war zone spreads, the more beneficial it is for us. Therefore, the Japanese decision to invade Guangxi provides us with another opportunity to deplete the Japanese army. (26th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Guilin Consultative Council sent telegrams to the consultative councils of various counties, which were then forwarded to township and town people's representative assemblies and elders, stating that at this critical moment when the enemy is pressing on the border, our brave Guangxi soldiers are duty-bound to serve on the battlefield and bear the responsibility of defending their homeland. It is hoped that you gentlemen will act swiftly and decisively, rise up in unison, follow the orders in the Bai Huang telegrams, actively mobilize the strength of the people, earnestly implement the National Covenant and the Military-Civilian Cooperation Covenant, thoroughly destroy the roads, and launch an expanded guerrilla war to inflict a head-on blow to the Japanese. We must ensure that the rice of Guangxi is not eaten by the Japanese, the water of Guangxi is not drunk by the Japanese, the houses of Guangxi are not inhabited by the Japanese, and the roads of Guangxi are not traveled by the Japanese, creating a victory even greater than that in northern Hunan.

<p>Chongqing: Wang Zhengting, former Chinese Ambassador to the United States, gave a radio address here last night, stating that the longer the European war lasts, the greater the need for Chinese industrial products will be. The nation should take this opportunity to work hard to increase production in order to obtain a large amount of foreign exchange. Wang repeatedly stated that production capacity is a prerequisite for national revival. Since the Opium War, China has always been a market for foreign goods, resulting in a trade deficit. Wang concluded by saying that although the Chinese coast is currently blockaded by the Japanese, the highest military authorities in China are still able to use various effective methods to seek the distribution of goods and the acquisition of foreign aid.

<h3 id="e9">American Opposition to Sanctions Against Japan <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>From today until the U.S. Congress reconvenes and the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty expires, there is less than two months left. During this period, the domestic political disputes in the United States will likely center on the issue of Japan.</p>
<p>The U.S. handling of Japanese atrocities has entered an important stage with the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty. Judging from the attitude of the current U.S. government, it is firm and clear: for the past two and a half years, it has repeatedly issued memoranda or verbal warnings and protests, all to no avail and with no effect. On July 25 of this year, it announced the termination of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, with a six-month period, that is, from now in another two months until January 26 of next year, the treaty will expire. On the 22nd of this month, Undersecretary of State Welles stated that, in view of Japan's failure to correct its atrocities, the United States will no longer negotiate a new treaty with it. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has also introduced a bill to authorize the President to prohibit the transportation of ordnance, ammunition, kerosene, and various metals and metal mixtures to Japan, which is violating the Nine-Power Treaty. These are the more obvious political measures; intimations to Japan in the military sphere are too numerous to mention. As for the actions after the commercial treaty expires, there is no need to speculate on the specific content now; even in terms of the basis for the actions, there are two different approaches: one is the activation of executive power, that is, the President issues an order to carry it out; the other is the activation of legislative power, that is, Congress enacts a law to carry it out; either one or both can be taken. The activation of executive power has great power in fact; for example, imposing prohibitions through taxation is equivalent to prohibition. The activation of legislative power has no limits in scope, and its nature is stricter and more absolute; for example, it is enshrined in law, and strict prohibitions are in place. Moreover, it does not have to be limited to prohibition; the legislator possesses supreme power, depending on what its intentions are. Given Japan's long-standing recklessness and unwillingness to repent, it is truly urgent to treat it with decisive orders from the U.S. President. It is also hoped that the U.S. Congress will jointly establish a way to punish it, emphasizing the effectiveness of containing violence. As the matter concerns Congress, even though the attitude of the ruling party is firm and clear, attention must still be paid to the attitude of the opposition party.</p>
<p>U.S. politics has two parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, which rise and fall in turn. Currently, the Democratic Party's Roosevelt is in charge of national affairs as President, and the Republican Party is in opposition. The two parties contend with each other when discussing politics, which is the normal state of party politics and cannot be considered strange or criticized. However, on the U.S. Far East policy, the two parties can still abandon their sectarian prejudices, because their attitudes are not fundamentally incompatible. Among them, there is a distinct group called the isolationists. The isolationists are found in both parties. The isolationist elements belonging to the Republican Party in opposition have a rather stubborn attitude due to the dual factors of "isolationist advocacy" and "opposition status." Among them, Senator Borah of the Democratic Party is particularly headstrong.</p>
<p>Recently, Borah and others have issued statements opposing the use of economic means to retaliate against Japan, saying that "trade between the United States and Japan is progressing, and we should not lightly abandon this commerce for no sufficient reason." It is expected that from now until the end of the deliberation of the anti-Japan bill after Congress reconvenes, opposition arguments similar to Borah's will continue to emerge. Although public opinion polls in the United States have proven that the vast majority of the public supports actively sanctioning Japan, the opposition cannot violate public sentiment in theory, and even for the sake of their political lives, they dare not go against public sentiment. Therefore, the opposition will certainly not be able to gain the upper hand. Even in terms of the number of seats in both houses of Congress, the opposition is only a minority and cannot achieve anything. Even if the anti-Japan bill is thwarted in Congress, it will not be able to obstruct the wise authorities from activating executive power within the scope allowed by their duties. Therefore, when the time comes, the U.S. action against Japanese atrocities will inevitably be firm and clear. Moreover, even those like Borah do not fundamentally condone Japanese atrocities or make distorted defenses of atrocities. However, there are still factors that can covertly agitate and conspire to incite opposition: first, using the issue of Japan as a tool for political struggle, especially since there will be competitive elections next year, there is a possibility of extreme abuse through distortion and utilization. Second, those engaged in trade with Japan seek immediate and private gains, disregarding the long-term, disregarding the principles of justice, and especially disregarding the fact that profits are blood and tears. Third, Japan spends tens of millions in propaganda every year, and now that it is facing a serious juncture, it cannot be that there will be no effect at all. Fourth, there are schemers who roam internationally and propagate the idea that sanctioning Japan would strengthen the collusion of militaristic aggressors, which would cause even deeper troubles, so it is better to open the net and appease them to mitigate the disaster. These four factors can help to promote shameless opposition.</p>
<p>However, the American opposition to sanctions against Japan will eventually be shattered. Of all arguments, those that can occupy a vast space and time, gain the popular support, and be immortalized are exceptional. If it is only the opinion of one family, some people will always believe in it, and it must have some merit in its unsoundness. But the opposition to sanctions against Japan has none. Even like Borah's statement, he does not defend Japanese atrocities, nor does he advocate that the United States accept violence and withdraw from the Far East. He only passively opposes economic retaliation, and there is absolutely no active suggestion to explain how the United States should deal with Japanese atrocities? How should the United States protect itself in the Far East? This exposes the failure of the opposition to possess the necessary conditions for establishing a theory. Moreover, the so-called not lightly abandoning trade with Japan seems to be a consideration of commercial interests. Then it has not considered the current commercial interests with China, as well as the long-term commercial interests when China wins the war of resistance and engages in reconstruction. This exposes the opposition's lack of skill in calculation. Dong Xian Guang once criticized Borah for only seeing "blood money," which is a piercingly accurate comment. If one only seeks profit from blood money, it may be justifiable in terms of egoism. But one should know that the one who supplies this blood money is plotting to destroy the other big customer of the United States, the one with the greatest hope. Then, to seize this blood money is no different from cutting one's own flesh. If one is willing to stop at cutting one's own flesh for the sake of the current blood money, one may still be able to do it. But have you not heard the Japanese roaring at the United States two weeks ago? They almost wanted to strangle the United States, only regretting that their feathers were not yet full. Helping the aggressors is helping them grow their feathers. Then, the blood money is not just obtained by cutting one's own flesh. It can also be regarded as selling one's life and pre-paying the price.</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to sources here today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has issued an order stating that from now on, all manufactured products from guerrilla areas, including those manufactured in Shanghai, will not be allowed to be imported into the areas controlled by the Chinese government. The reason for this policy adopted by the Chinese government is that it is very difficult to distinguish between Japanese goods and Chinese goods in guerrilla areas in fact. The factories in guerrilla areas are mostly nominally controlled by Chinese, but in fact, they are mostly controlled by the Japanese, and most of the raw materials used also come from Japan. However, raw materials from guerrilla areas can still be freely imported into areas controlled by the government. (26th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Swiss Capital: German authorities in the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia have recently intensified their oppressive measures against the Czech people. In Prague, German officials publicly executed nine Czech students in front of hundreds of people in Salga Park on the 17th of this month. In the town of Dis, a member of the National Socialist Party's security team was assassinated. German political police arrested more than 200 male residents of the town and announced that if the perpetrator was not found, one out of every ten residents would be executed by firing squad as retaliation. Czech workers, filled with indignation, decided to stage a general strike on the 22nd of this month. However, this news was learned by German spies, and German authorities threatened the workers' committees in Czech factories, saying that if a general strike broke out, all committee members would be executed. As a result, the strike did not materialize, but the workers' anger and resentment remained undiminished. (Havas dispatch dated 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Pittman States that the U.S. Should Not Accommodate Japan; Ban on Exports to Japan Expected to Pass <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated to the press yesterday that U.S.-Japan relations "are deteriorating," and the government is determined not to "appease" Japan. He will propose in the next session of Congress to authorize the President to issue an order to cease trade with Japan. Pittman continued, "I do not yet feel there is a need for appeasement. According to information I have received, Japan continues to undermine American rights in China. If Japan cannot comply with the terms of the Nine-Power Treaty, it is futile for us to renew a new commercial treaty with them." Pittman denied rumors circulating outside that members of the Foreign Relations Committee favor a conciliatory attitude towards Japan. "The government at present will not initiate any action externally, and takes this attitude towards the commercial treaty. The State Department's notification to Japan of the cancellation of the commercial treaty is intended to stop trade with Japan, and the Senate will certainly pass this. The United States will retaliate against those who violate treaties with the United States. Stopping trade will not affect American neutrality. If the material circumstances do not change, I am determined to bring about the cessation of trade with Japan as soon as possible." (United Press dispatch dated 26th)</p>
<p>Washington: Republican Senators Vandenberg and Borah recently made statements opposing economic retaliation against Japan. Democratic Senator Pittman (Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) responded, stating that his proposal in July of this year, which advocated authorizing the President to prohibit the shipment of arms, ammunition, kerosene, and various metals and metal mixtures to countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty (referring to Japan), is sure to gain sufficient votes when brought before the Senate for discussion in the future. Regarding this matter, because most senators are not currently in Washington, it is difficult to estimate how many support Pittman's proposal. However, senators in the Congressional recess chambers generally believe that opinions are now divided regarding the U.S. policy towards Japan: one faction advocates allowing the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty to expire on January 26, 1940, without renewing it; the other advocates establishing a temporary commercial treaty to make it more convenient for the U.S. and other related countries to try to discuss general issues in the Far East with Japan. It is known in the State Department that a majority of people in Japan are very willing to begin negotiations with the U.S. In addition, Japan's trade with European belligerents is becoming increasingly difficult, and its economic reliance on the U.S. is also increasing. Therefore, the U.S. is in a very advantageous position and need not rush to express its attitude. (Havas dispatch dated 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman today predicted that Congress will approve his proposed bill authorizing the President to prohibit the export of goods to Japan. He hopes for the re-establishment of a peaceful situation in the East, but he sees no reason why the U.S. should compromise with Japan in action or even in expression. According to reports, Pittman disclosed a few months ago that he had submitted a joint resolution to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, authorizing the President to restrict exports to any country that violates the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing the territorial and administrative integrity of China. Congress has repeatedly discussed it, recognizing this approach as an economic action against Japan's activities in China. The purpose of the bill is specifically to cut off the supply of military supplies to Japan, such as weapons, ammunition, and war materials, including steel, kerosene, gasoline, scrap iron, and scrap metal.

<p>Washington: Officials here recognize the meeting in Manila between the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hurd, and the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, as a routine annual meeting of U.S. leaders in the Far East, but they do not underestimate the importance of the extraordinary situation in Asia, which serves as the background for the meeting. Officials here stated that the Commander of the U.S. Army in Asia also regularly attends the meetings, and that when they do not hold meetings, the leaders exchange information to conduct useful reviews of different actions. They acknowledge that many new circumstances have arisen in the Far East, but decline to make specific criticisms. Although observers here regard the Manila Conference as extremely important, they believe that the final U.S. policy is largely determined by the people and Congress, and partly by the President. Therefore, the Manila Conference, at most, is of an advisory nature, or to assist in the implementation of established policies. Unofficial criticisms state that the Manila Conference can at least indicate that the U.S. has broad interests in the Far East, and that these interests have been directly affected by the turmoil caused by the war situation. They also point out that Manila is the center of U.S. interests in Asia, including a wide range of military facilities. It is believed here that the meeting provides the first opportunity for Admiral Hurd and Mr. Gauss to meet since Mr. Sayre took office. It is generally believed that the meeting will address all aspects of U.S. interests, such as U.S.-Japan relations, U.S. relations with the Dutch East Indies, and the issue of U.S. interests in China due to the establishment of a "new Chinese government." It is intended here to use the meeting report to determine the acute situation of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty and the U.S. defense plan. (United Press dispatch dated 22nd)</p>

<p>Washington: Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison released his annual report today, advocating retaining most of the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, saying that the fleet has the greatest opportunity for tactical training in the Pacific. But in addition, there are more important reasons, such as the unrest in the Far East, and the failure of the Allied Powers to maintain a strong fleet in the Far East. For many years, the U.S. has opposed dividing the Navy equally between the Atlantic and Pacific, and would rather station the Navy in the Pacific, due to strategic considerations. In terms of expenditure, a navy in both oceans is even less advisable. (Reuters dispatch dated 25th)</p>
<p>San Francisco: According to General Clarence, publisher of the Seattle Times and commander of the U.S. artillery regiment in the last European War, he stated today that although we do not want to be drawn into the vortex of war, seeking only not to be drawn into the vortex of war will put the country in danger. Therefore, the U.S. should adopt the following policies: (1) In addition to the currently established shipbuilding program, at least six to eight more battleships should be built. Although aircraft and submarines are formidable, it is battleships that can control the oceans. (2) The standing army should be expanded to 600,000, 400,000 of whom should be permanently stationed in the U.S., and plans should be made to cultivate senior military talent. (3) Expand the National Guard to 600,000, so that there is a reserve force for the regular army. (4) Expand the militia, so that the country can mobilize 1.5 million troops in the event of an emergency. Of course, all of this cannot be done without money, but after spending the money, no country will dare to interfere with U.S. policy, which is the greatest investment in peace. Finally, he said that after the last war, the U.S. abandoned its policy of maritime supremacy, which was a major mistake. If the U.S. had not abandoned its policy of a large navy, then when Japan invaded China, the U.S. could have ordered Japan to withdraw from China immediately. But having abandoned the policy of a large navy, we can only stand idly by regarding all of Japan's actions. (United Press dispatch dated 26th)</p>

<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued an official report today, declaring that there was only localized artillery fire on the Western Front. The German Air Force flew to the North Sea yesterday to bomb the British fleet, hitting four British ships, including a giant cruiser. The German Air Force also flew far to bomb the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland.

<p>Berlin: German official documents stated yesterday that the pound continues to plummet. In the past 14 months, gold worth approximately 300 million U.S. dollars has been shipped from London to New York. The British have lost so much gold that they dare not let the people know the truth. According to official observations here, the main purpose of the new British-French understanding is to protect the currency systems of the two countries. Therefore, France will mobilize a reserve of 100 billion francs to support the British currency system, not only to pay for its own expenses in purchasing military supplies in the United States, but also to pay for the British orders for military supplies in the United States. France will also allow Britain to set the exchange rate between the French franc and the British pound to pay for the expenses of the British army in France. German officials reiterated that France's need for food is not very dependent on foreign imports, while 80% of Britain's food is imported from overseas. Therefore, the German naval war will pose a greater threat to Britain. In the future, France will not only have to supply the British troops fighting in France with food produced in its own country, but also have to provide food relief to the people of England. In view of this, Britain is pleased with the opportunity for Britain and France to sign a new commercial agreement. Once this economic cooperation is realized, an economic crisis will follow.

<p>Helsinki Telegraph: According to general observation, although the Soviet Union's demands on Finland have not been met, it may not necessarily wage war on Finland. The reasons are as follows: (1) The Soviet Union has now obtained defensive points in the Baltic Sea, so whether it will destroy the treaty and damage its international reputation for relatively unimportant locations has become a matter of speculation to some extent. (2) Although the difference in population between the Soviet Union and Finland is vast, the Finnish army has always been a highly trained army, and its morale is also very high. The terrain is also favorable for resistance. If the war is prolonged, it will become a blow to the prestige of the Red Army. (3) The best approach is to wait for an opportunity, because Finland's long-term mobilization will not be able to bear the economic burden. If so, it may shake Finland's determination. According to reporters who inspected the area bordering the Soviet Union, the atmosphere is extremely tense. The lights in all paper mills and rayon factories are not allowed to leak out of the house in the slightest. At the same time, in Finland in winter, the sky becomes dark in the afternoon, and all cars must turn on their lights. Furthermore, the roads in the swampy areas are extremely narrow, and cars cannot pass at all, but the Finnish army is stationed there day and night. In addition, in the past three days, there has been heavy snowfall of three inches thick, and it is expected that even greater snow will fall soon. All of this is heaven's help to Finland. The Finnish border troops are all carrying light machine guns, and sometimes Finnish aircraft circle in the sky. From this situation, it can be seen that a conflict between the Soviet Union and Finland is unlikely to occur in the near future. (Haitong dispatch dated 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to widespread rumors here today, when the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania met in Tallinn, the three countries intended to mediate the dispute between the Soviet Union and Finland.

<p>Moscow: The officialdom here does not want to express opinions on the speech made by Finnish Prime Minister Cajander on Friday, but Soviet newspapers consider the remarks of the Finnish leader to be completely false. "The Finnish reactionaries simply do not want to establish any agreement with the Soviet Union, and they intend to challenge it. In short, if Finland continues its anti-Soviet attitude, the Soviet Union will never accept Finland's reconciliation methods during the period that the Finnish army is not demobilized." At the same time, the Soviet side is very unhappy with the repeated statements of Finnish leaders regarding independence, because the Soviet Union has absolutely no intention of harming Finland's independence. Not only does it have no intention of harming its independence, but the purpose of all the suggestions made by the Soviet side has been to enhance the safety of Finland and the Soviet Union.

<p>Rome – This morning, all newspapers prominently featured the debate yesterday between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and the British and French ambassadors to Italy regarding Britain's decision to strengthen contraband management. The disclosure of this news, Belgium's diplomatic approach to England, and the dispute over responsibility for the sinking of the "Zhaoguo Maru" show that the Allies' decision to tighten control over contraband is not welcomed by some countries. The "Roman Forum" newspaper published an editorial stating that while it is permissible for any belligerent to adopt retaliatory measures, it is illogical if such measures harm the interests of those outside the war, or drag these interests into the conflict. Italy, as a major power, must safeguard its spiritual and material interests and cannot remain indifferent. (Reuter's dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>The Hague – The announcement by England and France of a blockade of German export trade has been generally understood here, but it is hoped that Britain can minimize the damage to neutral countries as much as possible. The "Electrical News" recently published an article stating, "Since the neutral countries have made representations to the British government, that government has paid great attention and has expressed its determination not to needlessly increase the difficulties of the neutral countries. This statement should not be taken lightly. However, the extent to which the rights enjoyed by the neutral countries can be preserved is the question. Will Britain stop at an appropriate point to reduce the damage to the neutral countries? I fear that this will be difficult to achieve, because Britain has decided to wage a comprehensive economic war against Germany, and there is no room for leniency. Britain's goal is to cut off German export trade, and the interests of the neutral countries will inevitably be damaged. Regarding this, Italy has proposed a compensation method, and it is rumored that Britain intends to charter Dutch ships to alleviate the damage caused to the Netherlands by the British blockade of German export trade."

<p>Berlin – As the European war enters its thirteenth week, the German people are determined to intensify the war effort. The increasing number of ships sunk by torpedoes and mines recently, and the active operations of German reconnaissance aircraft over England and France, have proven that Britain's island nation advantage is a thing of the past. If Germany can disrupt British shipping, Britain will suffer a fatal blow. It is pointed out here that Britain's blockade policy has failed to oppress Germany or force it to adopt Napoleon's Continental System. After being subjected to Germany's naval attacks, Britain has now adopted a new blockade policy, which has provoked protests from neutral countries. According to the "Frankfurt Report", Germany's war aim is to maintain German unity. Germany has been forced to fight repeatedly for a century because its desire to establish a free and unified nation has been suppressed. This threat must be eliminated, and the German people will continue to fight with the utmost determination. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam – According to news from Berlin, after studying the results of the first week of unrestricted mine warfare, Hitler has ordered the intensification of this tactic. Hitler believes that mines are currently the most effective weapon and boasts of having used mines to put Britain on the defensive. At the same time, it is heard that German naval shipyards are now working in three shifts, around the clock, to manufacture mobile small submarines and 1,200-ton or larger submarines, which Germany previously neglected. In addition, munitions factories have been ordered to increase the production of the latest types of mines. (Reuter dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – German radio claimed that a certain German newspaper today warned neutral ships that in the future, if German submarines have any doubts about neutral ships, they will be intercepted without leniency, because Germany's only response to British tactics is to launch a large-scale attack without any reservation. (Reuter dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – The diplomatic correspondent of the "Sunday Electrical News" published an article today, stating that the German plan for war against the Allied powers of England and France can now be revealed. This plan was agreed upon by Hitler during a meeting with his generals last week. In other words, those who advocate intensifying the war economically and in the air and at sea have gained the upper hand. Conversely, those who advocate launching a full-scale offensive on the Western Front have lost out. Therefore, the German Air Force will launch a full-scale offensive against the British coast and fortified cities in the spring of next year. From now until then, a small number of aircraft will be sent to raid England, to greatly stimulate nerves, and to intensify submarine and mine warfare to strike at British and neutral countries' commerce. At the same time, they will intensify threats against neutral countries, forcing them to cease trading with England. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Stockholm – The Naval Department has just issued a bulletin stating that the mine network laid by Germany off the coast of Falster Island, Denmark, has been expanding, especially northward, and that these mines have also been found in Swedish territorial waters. The Swedish government will immediately lodge a protest with the German authorities, because this action has effectively blockaded the Falsterbo Strait between Denmark and Sweden and cut off shipping between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – After Germany expanded its mine network yesterday in the Falsterbo Strait between Sweden and Denmark, especially south of Oresund Bay in Sweden, the Danish Daily News commented on this today, expressing unease, stating that Germany's action clearly failed to respect Swedish territorial waters (four miles from the coast). The two countries originally planned to reopen commercial negotiations in the short term, and it is expected that this action will have a significant impact. This approach is definitely not acceptable to Sweden. Furthermore, Britain's decision to blockade German export trade seriously threatens the shipping industry of neutral countries. To date, 37 Swedish ships have been detained in German ports, 13 of which were transporting wood pulp to Belgium and the Netherlands, and another eight were sailing to England to load coal and return home. The German authorities have detained them for reasons that are mostly untenable. In addition, the British have also detained 15 Swedish ships, but their attitude is not as barbaric as that of the Germans, which is the real situation. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – Well-informed sources have just announced that the Admiralty has obtained several German magnetic mines and is immediately examining them in the hope of finding a way to defend against them. It is heard that some discoveries have been made and that results may be achieved soon. According to experts, the way to defend is to install fixed or mobile "magnets" far away to detonate these mines without causing harm. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>London – The British refrigerated ship "Sussex" (2,060 tons) struck a mine in the Thames Estuary today, causing considerable damage. It has been towed into port by a tugboat. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>It is learned that the "Sussex" belongs to the "Peninsular and Oriental Company" and is dedicated to sailing between England and Australia. Its launch ceremony was held in 1937 and is the latest type of meat transport ship. Although the ship was able to reach the Thames safely, the meat it was carrying has been lost.

The nine crew members fell into the sea and swam for several hours, but eight of them drowned. Only one person was rescued and has landed in the port of Boulogne, France. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – The Swedish oil tanker "Gustav Routh" (6,300 tons) set sail from Norway the day before yesterday, via the Shetland Islands, bound for Curacao. While sailing near the north coast of England, it was severely damaged after hitting a mine. At 4:00 this morning, the ship sent out a distress signal, claiming that the ship was gradually sinking and that there were still 34 crew members on board. After that, there was no more news. It is believed here that the ship has probably sunk. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>The Hague – The Dutch oil tanker "Slite Trelle" was sunk by a German submarine (only five of the 31 crew members were rescued). The Telecommunications News commented on this, stating, "There is no reason for the German submarine to take this action. Even if the submarine commander thought it was necessary, he should have considered humanity and rescued the crew members to preserve their lives. It is correct to let the crew members drift in several lifeboats in the raging wind and waves without offering assistance is extremely barbaric. The Netherlands is a neutral country, and we have no other desire than to maintain neutrality, but this does not mean that we will silently allow other countries to infringe on the lives and property of our people without protesting. In short, the sinking of the 'Slite Trelle' by the German submarine is a shameful act." The People's Daily reported that the country to which the submarine that sank the "Slite Trelle" belonged has been identified. Germany's indiscriminate submarine warfare led to its isolation during the last European war and prompted the United States to enter the war. Will this happen again today?" The Rotterdam City News reported that this type of German naval warfare is inhuman and that all countries will be able to deal with it with effective defensive methods. The British naval power is great and cannot be defeated by this type of German tactic. Considering that the German fleet is still hiding in its own ports, while the British navy is able to control all the oceans, Germany's repeated attacks with submarines, mines, aircraft, and disguised pirate ships have not damaged Britain's naval authority.

<h3 id="e47">The Rampant Situation of Poisons in Nanjing: Report by Dr. Bates, Vice President of Jinling University; So This is the So-Called "East Asia New Order" <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that regarding the problem of poisons in Nanjing, Dr. Bates, Vice President of Jinling University, has carefully inquired of many friends and obtained information from officials of the "Reformed Government" and the "Municipal Government," as well as from people in the pseudo-poison distribution agencies, and has prepared a report vehemently opposing the "East Asia New Order." The report stated that there is a population of 480,000 in Nanjing city and the areas adjacent to the city walls, with no fewer than 30 opium retail shops, 175 opium dens, and 14 hotels providing opium for smoking, all of which are licensed. However, there is also a huge amount of private poison trade that has not been authorized, and officials are now continuing to try to control it. This is called "opium suppression." Opium is supplied by the "Opium Suppression Bureau" and sold to public opium retail shops at a price of 19 yuan per ounce, which is then resold by the opium retail shops to the opium dens at a price of about 22 yuan per ounce, but the price is determined by the amount of opium in stock. There is now</p>
<p>Conclusive evidence proves that public opium retail shops sell an average of</p>
<p>Three thousand ounces of opium per day, worth 66,000 yuan. There is also a lot of opium that is not sold by opium retail shops, and opium sold by opium dens, if not purchased from opium retail shops, is often inspected and fined. There are no regulations or accounting for opium sold by opium retail shops, but perhaps 20% to 30% of the opium sold by opium retail shops is not consumed by the 480,000 people in Nanjing. Furthermore, there is privately sold opium in Nanjing, so the actual amount of opium consumed each day is definitely more than 3,000 ounces. Opium smokers need more than one yuan a day to maintain their habit, but the poor consume less than one yuan of opium a day. It is generally believed that the 3,000 ounces of opium sold each day is enough to supply at least 60,000 people, but the total number of opium addicts is far above 60,000. According to various reports, a conclusion can be reached that most of the opium comes from "Manchukuo," followed by Iranian soil, which is purchased and transported by the Japanese. As for those from Annam and the northern border of Jiangsu and Anhui, the number is not large. The "Executive Yuan of the Reformed Government" engages in opium trading in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, handling about 1 million ounces of opium per month and collecting a "tax" of 3 yuan per ounce, so it can earn</p>
<p>Three million yuan in revenue per month. According to senior officials, the amount of opium sold each month is actually far greater than 1 million ounces. The fact that Nanjing sells 90,000 ounces per month supports this argument, because the number of opium smokers elsewhere is more than 11 times that of Nanjing. The "Opium Suppression Bureau" is expanding its distribution points, and even small towns have opium retail shops. It is heard that a certain city, whose status is far lower than Nanjing, has more than 300 licensed opium dens. The strong support of the "Reformed Government" is actually for the revenue of 3 million yuan. Chinese and Japanese officials alike say that in the current situation, maintaining any government, this type of income is essential. Furthermore, it is heard from political circles that the income of the rulers of this area is not only the opium revenue of 3 yuan per ounce. According to an official, the original price of opium from Dalian is 8 yuan per ounce, plus 2 yuan for transportation, but the wholesale price is 19 yuan per ounce, so the "tax" paid is actually 9 yuan. A certain "Reformed" official frankly stated that the military police and the secret service department both receive a portion of the profits. There is no public organization for heroin trading, so other than the military police and those close to senior management, no one can make statistical reports.</p>
<p>Long-time heroin dealers claim that heroin is transported from Dalian and Tianjin along the Jinpu Railway in large packages, escorted by Japanese ruffians, and fully protected by the army, until it arrives at the distribution points in Nanjing. There are four heroin dealers in Nanjing who are known as the "Heroin Kings." One sales agency employs about 2,400 people, and there are tens of thousands of heroin addicts. The authorities prohibit heroin, and there are many people who are arrested and questioned for smoking or selling it. However, the detention centers are overcrowded, so most of the "prisoners" must be released within five days. According to street rumors, there are two reasons why the authorities arrest heroin offenders: (1) to extort money; (2) to maintain opium sales, so as to avoid the increasingly fierce competition from heroin. Pure heroin sells for about 300 yuan per ounce, while adulterated heroin sells for 130 yuan. Small packets of heroin sell for only two or three cents. Opium addicts need to consume about one yuan of heroin a day to be satisfied, but its results and convenience are better than opium. In total, those who suffer from poisons account for one-fourth or one-third of the total population. The police even claim that the number is even higher. The following matters are visible</p>
<p>The general harm of poisons: (1) A kind-hearted Japanese military officer said that he was surprised to see young men and women who had become addicted to heroin and were imprisoned; (2) A police officer was responsible for investigating 133 households, of which 66 were opium addicts. The police officer found it difficult to order these 66 people to only buy opium from opium retail shops; (3) People in officialdom, regardless of their rank, including the police, are addicted to opium in large numbers; (4) A certain teacher said angrily, "In ten years, there will be no good people in Nanjing"; (5) A certain police officer claimed that 20 to 30 people die of starvation every day due to heroin addiction. Compared with the current situation in Nanjing a year ago, the following changes are worth noting. Opium advertisements are no longer found in newspapers or on the streets, either because of the official's sense of shame or because everyone knows about the opium trade and there is no need to advertise it. However, the signs of opium retail shops and opium dens are still hung in the main roads. The authorities used to pretend to crack down on opium addicts, but now they have abolished it. Anyone can</p>
<p>Buy opium at any time. Although heroin is slightly hidden, it is sold openly in a densely populated area. The number of heroin addicts is appalling. The "government" and some people now rely on the poison business to make a living. Is this the "East Asia New Order"? If so, then the Chinese people now understand its meaning. Otherwise, those responsible should correct it. The author is a Christian and is now writing this report in the great tradition of the anti-drug movement of British and American missionaries. It must be known that opium is a sin, and those who profit from it or protect this sin are shameful.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Jiangsu Pseudo-Provincial Government Issues Pseudo-Copper Coin Notes, Actually Without Reserve Funds <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Suzhou pseudo-provincial government has many redundant staff and huge expenses. The source of funds depends entirely on donations and taxes, and the collection of land taxes from the occupied pseudo-county governments. However, although the collection of land taxes in various counties was started early, the amount collected is still very small, seemingly non-existent. They want to strictly urge and pursue the collection from the countryside, but because the police force is weak, there is nothing they can do. Therefore, the expenses of the pseudo-provincial government are stretched and overwhelmed. Recently, in order to urgently put out the fire, it issued 150,000 yuan of copper coin notes to supplement the funds, under the pretext of facilitating small change in the market, but in reality, it is to absorb cash. The copper coin notes are nominally issued by the pseudo-provincial treasury, but in reality, there are no reserve funds, which shows the extent of the economic exhaustion of the pseudo-provincial government. The notes are divided into four types: one coin, ten coins, fifteen coins, and thirty coins. The paper is thin and the printing is poor. All shops in Suzhou have now been forced to use them, but the people have no confidence in these unreliable copper coins. The reason why they can circulate in the market now is entirely due to force. Shanghai has already issued small change notes twice. The people in the occupied areas urgently hope that the small change notes will be issued more and imported into the occupied areas so that the pseudo-copper coin notes will have no place to stand.</p>
<h3 id="e49">The Japanese Army's Landing in Southern Guangdong: Ando Issued a Mobilization Order After Returning to Guangzhou; Japanese Naval and Land Forces Arrived in Weizhou Island One After Another; The Japanese Army Attempted to Go Straight to Nanning via Longmen <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hong Kong reports that early this month, Ando, the commander of the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army, returned to Guangzhou from Shanghai. He then convened a meeting of Japanese generals and puppet organization figures. The first issue was to increase troop deployments to the south and to agree on a route of invasion. The meeting was held under strict security, but it was already known outside that there were plans for a major offensive against Guangxi. The second issue was to discuss the rotation of two Japanese divisions stationed in Guangzhou. As soon as the meeting ended, an order to temporarily block the Humen (Bocca Tigris) strait was issued. In the following ten days, Japanese troops from Taiwan and Chaozhou were continuously transported to Guangdong, entering through Humen. At the same time, more than twenty Japanese transport ships gathered outside the Pearl River estuary, carrying Japanese mechanized units and a certain division stationed in Guangzhou to southern Guangdong. This secret movement lasted for a week. Publicly, it was announced that the Humen strait was being cleared of mines, prohibiting Chinese and foreign ships from entering and exiting. In reality, the Japanese military did not allow Chinese and foreign ships to mix in during the transportation period to prevent any disadvantage. Only after the Guangzhou Japanese army had completed its transport ten days later did the Jinshan, a merchant ship that left Hong Kong for Guangzhou on the 14th, set sail for Guangzhou.</p>
<p>While the majority of the Japanese troops were being transferred to southern Guangdong, a portion temporarily awaited orders on Weizhou Island, while another portion was stationed on ships. From the waters near Weizhou Island to the sea areas of Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Qionghai, and the Leizhou Peninsula Strait, no fewer than thirty or forty Japanese warships were concentrated. The Beihai sea area had long been blockaded. All foreign merchant ships entering were inspected by Japanese warships and prevented from unloading cargo. Therefore, in recent months, ships sailing from Hong Kong to Beihai or from Guangzhou Bay had been unable to deliver goods and had to proceed directly to Haiphong. The British Imperial Airways passenger aircraft, the Daedalus, departed from Hong Kong on the morning of the 8th. While flying over Weizhou Island, it was suddenly attacked by Japanese warships with anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese troops on Weizhou Island also opened fire with machine guns. Five Japanese aircraft then took off, surrounding and attacking the British aircraft, blocking its path. The Imperial Airways aircraft was forced to land on Weizhou Island, and the passengers and pilot were detained. The severity of the Japanese warships' blockade of Beihai at the time was evident.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Leizhou sea area was also being unofficially blockaded. On the 6th and 7th of this month, Japanese warships constantly patrolled the Leizhou Strait, and transport ships shuttled back and forth. Whenever they encountered fishing boats at sea, they would pursue and capture them, killing the fishermen and burning their boats. It is estimated that no fewer than one hundred and several dozen fishing boats have been burned. Hai'an Port in Xuwen County, Leizhou Prefecture, was also blockaded by Japanese warships, and civilian and fishing boats in the port had been unable to exit for half a month. The Qinzhou and Lianzhou sea area was the intended destination for the Japanese army's passage. Therefore, for several months, technicians had been surveying the water depth along the coast of Guantou Ridge and the Qisha sea area of Fangcheng, and placing buoys to facilitate the docking of Japanese warships.</p>
<p>The Chinese military authorities in Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Gaozhou, Leizhou, and Yangjiang anticipated that the Japanese army would sooner or later attempt to achieve its goals in the southern route. For months, they had made thorough arrangements for coastal defense, such as arming and training the populace, organizing joint defense among teams, implementing a scorched-earth policy and evacuating empty houses along the coast, dispersing the population, moving supplies, demolishing pillboxes, destroying highways, establishing more guard posts, and establishing a dense transportation network, sparing no effort. They were especially strict in inspecting traitors. The coastline was divided into defense zones, and all rice paddies were harvested early, with the defending army harvesting on behalf of the farmers. The fields were then plowed, turned over, and filled with water to prevent the enemy's mechanized units from penetrating deeply.</p>
<p>In the past week, the Japanese army's invading troops have gradually gathered on Weizhou Island and on ships in the sea area. On the 8th of this month, the Japanese warships gathered in the Qinzhou and Lianzhou sea area numbered sixteen or seventeen, including over twenty transport ships, and two small aircraft carriers, the "Kaga" and "Peng Bird," each with over twenty seaplanes. Additionally, there were about forty Japanese aircraft at the Japanese airfield on Weizhou Island. For the past two months, Japanese aircraft have continuously bombed Guangxi Province over Qinzhou and Lianzhou. In the past two weeks, there has not been a day without such acts of cruelty. By the 14th of this month, the Japanese army in southern Guangdong was ready to go. At around 5:00 AM on the 15th, transport ships carrying one to two thousand soldiers invaded the northwest coast of Beihai. Several Japanese gunboats bombarded the area. The defending army initially calmly fought back. However, when the Japanese army sent over ten aircraft to bomb at low altitude, half of the defending army's positions were destroyed. Moreover, the Japanese army's momentum was fierce, using the strength of a lion to seize a rabbit, swarming in. With a disparity in numbers, the defending army was forced to temporarily shift its position. Five hundred Japanese soldiers then forcibly landed successively at 9:00 AM that morning, advancing on Beihai City in two routes. Beihai had previously evacuated its supplies and population, resembling a dead city. The Japanese army intended to enter Guangxi Province via Beihai to reach Nanning. However, large armies from both Guangdong and Guangxi were concentrated northeast of Beihai, and it would not be easy for the Japanese army to lightly advance into Guangxi. Currently, the defending army in Qinzhou and Lianzhou has selected positions to engage in battle with the Japanese army. Residents of Qinzhou and Lianzhou have been relocating inland or fleeing to French Haiphong, Annam, and Guangzhou Bay to avoid the conflict, with the majority fleeing to Haiphong. French military police in Haiphong have now established strict defenses to prevent. After the Japanese army occupied the northwest coast of Beihai, they searched for an airfield to facilitate the Japanese aircraft's However, many villagers had scattered, and the Japanese army felt it was extremely difficult to build defensive fortifications.

<p>A dispatch from Chengdu reports that due to the Yellow River flood disaster, 3 million refugees from eastern and northern Henan have crossed the new channel of the Yellow River, seeking a livelihood to the west. The situation for 300,000 people who urgently need relief is the most dire. Without clothing or food, it is difficult to survive. As early winter approaches and the weather becomes increasingly cold, relief work is urgently needed. Zhu Qinglan, a standing committee member of the Central Relief Committee, is currently in Shaanxi, consulting with the Henan and Shaanxi provincial governments to establish a joint relief association to seek relief. Of the 300,000 disaster victims urgently in need of relief, 200,000 will be distributed to western Henan to engage in production work, which is currently being actively transported and arranged by the Henan provincial government. It is expected to be completed by early winter. The remaining 100,000 will be transported to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and other provinces to engage in reclamation. The Sichuan province is allocating 15,000 refugees, who have successively arrived in Hanzhong. The Sichuan Provincial Relief Association and the Chengdu General Station of the Central Relief Committee are rushing to formulate plans to allocate them to Guangyuan and Jiange in northern Sichuan. The elderly and weak will receive relief, while the young and strong will engage in land reclamation and small-scale industrial production. All measures have now been generally finalized.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Haizhou reports that since the arrival of Zhang Yi's troops from the First Route Army in Haizhou, there have been repeated battles in the past half-month. On the 15th of this month, Zhang's troops attacked Wuzhuang Town, near Haizhou. The town was originally garrisoned by a joint Japanese and puppet force of about 500 people, who hastily responded. After a day-long battle, it was estimated that 32 Japanese soldiers and over 80 puppet soldiers were killed, 15 Japanese soldiers were captured, and over 50 rifles, many Japanese flags, and a large amount of ammunition and military supplies were seized. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army in Banpu urgently dispatched the Mikawa Infantry Regiment and the Kuwagawa Cavalry Regiment, repeatedly reinforcing from Xinba and Pingming Street, but were ultimately intercepted halfway by Zhang, who personally led his troops. On the 16th, the Japanese army finally gave way and On the 17th, he then recaptured Xinba. The Japanese army in Haizhou is now extremely fearful.</p>

<p>In order to continue the Xianggui battles, the Japanese army has transferred eleven divisions to reinforce those two areas. The Japanese army in Songhu has been almost entirely depleted, with puppet police taking over sentry posts and a very small number of naval marines maintaining the surface. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Increasing Reinforcements to Reverse the Decline</p>
<p>Since the Japanese government appointed Nishio and Itagaki as the commander-in-chief and chief of staff of the China Expeditionary Army, respectively, their first battle was the disastrous defeat at Changsha, northern Hunan. The two major officials, known for being talented members of the younger generation of Japan, were humiliated by this. Therefore, to make a final struggle and reverse the declining trend, they specially transferred newly dispatched Japanese troops, Kwantung Army troops, and troops recuperating in the rear in northern and central China to form eleven divisions. Six divisions were sent to the front lines in northern Hunan, upstream of the Yangtze River, to reinforce, and five divisions were sent to Guangxi to reinforce and attack Nanning, attempting a desperate gamble. It is heard that a fierce war is about to break out in northern Hunan. A certain commander-in-chief of the Chinese side has made full preparations to inflict a serious blow on the stubborn enemy upon their invasion.</p>
<p>Defense is Weak; Puppet Police Take Over</p>
<p>In order to support the Xianggui battles, the Japanese side not only transferred all of the resting troops in the rear in various parts of China to reinforce, but also transferred all of the Japanese army retreating from the front and gathering in Wusong, Baoshan, Jiangwan, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the South City. However, in order to maintain appearances, they specially transferred the only special naval marine corps from the ships docked in the Huangpu River, allocating a very small number to land and garrison the Central Mint, the Bank of Communications warehouse, the Hongkou Headquarters, the Wusong Paotaiwan, and the Shizilin, among other places. The sentry posts along the roads in the aforementioned areas and along the Suzhou Creek were manned by a small number of Japanese troops, and the rest have been taken over by puppet police. This shows that they have exhausted their tricks and are growing more anxious.</p>
<p>Stringent Security; Searching Pedestrians</p>
<p>Since the incident on the 19th of this month when a Japanese man named Asahina was robbed on Tangshan Road, the strict security measures in the Hongkou Yangshupu area have not been relaxed to this day. In addition to conducting strict checks on Chinese people entering and exiting the bridges and gaps leading into the special zone, they have also deployed naval marines and consular police to patrol the main roads every evening, implementing security measures. They search the entire bodies of Chinese people and inquire in detail about their age, origin, and address. If the Japanese army believes that the answers do not match their permits, or if the photos on the permits do not match their appearance, they are immediately arrested.</p>
<p>Searching House by House; Harassing in Every Way</p>
<p>According to people from Hongkou, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 25th), six or seven members of the Japanese military police suddenly conducted house-by-house searches in the alleyways of Songpan Road and Yangshupu Road, but the result was nothing. Passengers in "Central China Company cars" only needed to show their permits in the car to pass normally when driving to Japanese military posts. However, recently, all Chinese passengers must get out of the car and wait for inspection before being allowed to board. On the 5th of this month, the Japanese military posts at ten key intersections that had been withdrawn have now been restored to their original state every evening. Moreover, there are several places where no sentries had been stationed before that have now been added, and inspections are being conducted on Chinese pedestrians.</p>
<p>Military Telephones Installed in Hongkou</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Japanese army installed military telephones on Bazhi Road, north of Suzhou Road (between the Baibo Bridge and the Sichuan Road Bridge), five Japanese soldiers installed military telephones in the Taopeng Road Yangshupu Road area yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. From this, we can see the panic of the Japanese army and their intensification of security.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Puppet Police in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area Intensify Their Encroachment on Police Power; Posts Extend to Columbia Road Intersection; Gangsters Run Rampant in the Wujiaochang Area <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The actions of the Japanese puppets in Shanghai to encroach on police power in the extra-settlement roads area have recently intensified. The puppet "Shanghai West Police Branch" has not only expanded its existing organization and moved to 11 Extreme Road, but has also successively established puppet police substations in important sections of Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Haig Road, attempting to realize the illusion of controlling all the extra-settlement roads. The puppet police posted on Anhe Temple Road have extended from the Victory Road area to the Columbia Road intersection. Currently, the patrol room has patrol teams and two armored vehicles patrolling back and forth all day long, making the situation suddenly tense. In the Caojiadu and Wujiaochang areas, opium dens and casinos are densely located, and "gangsters" gather, being the source of all evils. After 12:00 AM every night, the puppet police and patrolmen are all withdrawn, shops close early, and there are very few pedestrians on the road. Therefore, the gangsters take the opportunity to move out in all directions, openly prying open the doors of residents and robbing property. If the victims report to the patrol room for arrest, they will inevitably be arrested by the puppet police, severely interrogated, and falsely accused, causing those who have been poisoned to remain silent. And those gangsters have become even more unscrupulous.</p>

<p>The entire Shanghai food situation once tended to stabilize, and rice prices plummeted to around 26 yuan. In recent days, due to rampant rice weevils, baseless rumors have spread in the market, causing anxiety among the people and rice prices to rebound again. However, the rice industry associations in this city have been standing by idly, which is also their responsibility. It is deeply hoped that the authorities will conduct a thorough investigation impartially. Yesterday, 20,658 bags of tribute rice arrived by wheel, and the source of national rice continues to flow. It is estimated that over 6,000 bags arrived by wheeled transport yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Shanghai-Ningbo Voyage Shortened; May Be Realized; Six Ships Designated for Passengers Only, Unloading Passengers Only <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>There are currently thirteen foreign ships sailing the Shanghai-Ningbo route, but the voyage is extremely slow because they have to wait outside Zhenhai Port to unload cargo. Each trip takes more than a month. Although two anchorages have been added outside Zhenhai Port, allowing four ships to unload cargo simultaneously, the shortage of barges and the seasonal winds outside the port hinder barge transport, so the voyage has still not been shortened as much as possible.</p>
<p>Travelers still feel deeply inconvenienced. After discussions among shipping companies, a request was submitted to the Ningbo Defense Headquarters to find a way to adjust the situation. The headquarters approved the request and designated six ships for passengers only: Mufuk, Deping, Bao, Hana, Haifu, and Feikang. The goal is to shorten the voyage and facilitate travel. It is stipulated that the above six ships will load passengers in Shanghai and proceed to Zhenhai. After arriving in Zhenhai, they will unload passengers in order and return to the original port without unloading the cargo, then load passengers again and sail to Ningbo. This will free up time to wait for unloading, allowing for multiple passenger trips.</p>
<p>It is also stipulated that each ship will run on a three-day schedule. According to the shipping industry, if there are no other obstacles, this plan is expected to be implemented starting from the 1st of next month. After that, one ship from Shanghai will sail to Zhenhai every three days, thus greatly shortening the voyage and making travel more convenient.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs considers diesel fuel essential for wartime industrial machinery and transportation, and, like gasoline, an important fuel for wartime. In addition to making every effort to research, improve, and increase production, it has recently issued a general order to the governments of all provinces, cities, and counties to instruct public and private institutions and the public to conserve diesel fuel as much as possible to meet the needs of long-term war.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Japan Attempts to Control China's Entire Shipping Industry; Planned Conspiracies Are Implemented Successively; The Rights of Third Countries Are Completely Disregarded <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Mainland Daily reports that as of yesterday (the 25th), although third countries have protested to Japan against the continued blockade of the Yangtze River and the prohibition of foreign ships from sailing, Tokyo has not yet responded, or has refused to do so under the pretext of "military necessity." However, Japanese shipping companies are preparing long-term expansion plans to ultimately gain complete control of China's coastal and waterway trade. Japanese officials expect to achieve their expansion plans in about three years, gradually eliminating foreign shipping from all areas of the trade routes. The Japanese "East Asia Shipping Company" has ordered no fewer than 72 ships, totaling over 25,000 tons. From this, we can see the scope of the Japanese attempt to gain a complete monopoly. Among the ships that the company has already ordered or is currently building, there are three large cargo-passenger ships dedicated to the Yangtze River. One is named Dongmaru (transliteration), weighing 3,500 tons, which was completed last month. There are also two recently launched ships, the 4,020-ton Myokomaru and the 2,577-ton Shinshinmaru (both transliterations). At the same time, although Japan has repeatedly claimed that Japanese ships carrying goods to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are engaged in army and navy work, according to the monthly report of the Shanghai Inland Water Transport Company, the company transported no less than 1,461 tons of goods to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in October. The amount of goods transported on smaller rivers is also considerable. According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, the business of the Shanghai Inland Water Transport Company in October decreased slightly compared to September. In October, the company transported 30,167 tons of goods from Shanghai and 29,694 tons of goods to Shanghai, for a total of 59,861 tons. In the same month, 23,906 tons of goods were transported along the Suzhou River, 7,998.5 tons were transported along the Huangpu River, and 1,461 tons were transported along the Yangtze River. Compared with September, the cargo volume in October fell by 1,773 tons, while passenger volume increased by 2,289 people.</p>
<p>The total number of passengers carried was 125,707. Currently, the East Asia Shipping Company of Japan operates a total of 160,000 tons of ships, crowding out third-country ships in central China. According to a Japanese announcement yesterday, when the first year of the three-year plan begins in the spring of next year, the Japanese company will add ten new ships, each with a carrying capacity of 4,000 tons. When the second year of the plan is implemented in 1941, Japan will completely control shipping in North China. When the third year of the plan is implemented in 1942, Japan will control shipping in South China. The construction of the Yawan will be completed on December 10. By March of next year, there will be six other ships with the same tonnage as the Xingyawan completed successively. In addition, several ships, such as the Ningbowa, will also be completed next year.</p>

<h3 id="e59">To Prevent Profiteering from Melting, Increase the Exchange Rate of Copper Coins; 200 Coins Exchanged for One Legal Tender Yuan; Strictly Prohibit Smuggling, Hoarding, and Speculation; The Ministry of Finance Issues an Order to All Provinces and Cities to Comply <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has long issued an order to investigate and arrest those who smuggle copper coins out and allow the Central Bank and local banks to issue fractional currency notes for circulation. Since the outbreak of the European War, copper prices have soared. To prevent profiteering from melting, the exchange rate of 10-cash copper coins has been increased, and smuggling, private destruction, hoarding, and speculation have been strictly prohibited. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Prohibit Smuggling, Hoarding, and Speculation</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to various provinces, stating that the copper coins circulating in the market are closely related to the people's daily needs and should be maintained at a certain quantity to regulate supply and demand and stabilize life. The smuggling and private destruction of copper coins have long been strictly prohibited by the Ministry, and orders have been issued to effectively stop them. Recently, due to the outbreak of the European War, copper prices have gradually risen, and unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to collect and melt them for profit. During this period of resistance, stabilizing the people's livelihood is the most important current policy. In addition to separate telegrams, we specially request that you relay this to your subordinates and strictly prohibit the smuggling and private destruction of copper coins, and crack down on hoarding and speculation. Once discovered, they should be severely punished according to the law to warn against wrongdoing and maintain the currency policy.</p>
<p>Newly Defined Exchange Rate for 10-Cash Copper Coins</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to various provincial governments, stating that the 10-cash copper coins circulating in the market are closely related to the people's daily needs. In order to unify the exchange rate and prevent manipulation, the Ministry stipulated when implementing the legal tender in 1914 that one legal tender yuan would be exchanged for 300 10-cash copper coins and issued orders to comply. Recently, due to the outbreak of the European War, copper prices have gradually risen, and unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to collect and melt them for profit. It is urgent to redefine the exchange rate to prevent this. After careful consideration of the situation, it has been newly stipulated that the exchange rate of 10-cash copper coins will be 200 10-cash copper coins for one legal tender yuan. In provinces and regions where 10-cash copper coins are circulated, the exchange rate must be unified and must not be arbitrarily increased or decreased in order to prevent private destruction and facilitate the people's use. In addition to separate telegrams, we specially request that you relay this to your subordinates for unified knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="e63">The French Second Battalion Stationed in Shanghai Ordered to Depart for Vietnam; Soldiers Rejoice, Preparing to Return to Battle; Some Say the Battalion Must Still Return to Shanghai for Garrison Duty <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the French colonial infantry's second battalion, approximately 800 men, including 60 recently conscripted French citizens of Shanghai, abruptly bid farewell to Shanghai yesterday (the 25th). Shortly after noon yesterday, seven public buses and more than a dozen military trucks carrying the battalion's soldiers, their families, military equipment, etc., passed along Avenue Edward VII and the Bund, crossed the Garden Bridge, and arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf. They boarded the French Postal Company's "Antrilaipeng" (transliteration) ship (8,000 tons). Many of their friends went to the wharf to see them off in the cold wind. The "Antrilaipeng" will sail to Saigon, stopping only in Hong Kong en route. It was originally scheduled to weigh anchor at 6:00 AM this morning (the 26th), but it is expected that the departure time will be changed due to threats from spies on their departure time from Shanghai. It is said that the second battalion will be stationed in Vietnam, presumably to replace the French forces being transferred to the European battlefield. It is also known that the soldiers of the second battalion were last granted leave on the evening of Friday the 5th of last week, and they were quite joyful upon hearing the news of their departure, firmly believing that they would not be stationed in Vietnam for long and would soon be transferred back to France. However, well-informed sources in this city believe that the battalion will soon return to this city for garrison duty. Many of the soldiers are married and are taking their wives and children with them.</p>

<p>According to returned overseas Chinese who had resided in France, since France implemented military action against Germany, wartime measures have been implemented for everything in the country. In order to prevent capital outflow, the French government has stipulated that each foreigner is limited to 500 francs when carrying national currency out of the country. That is, when carrying British pounds, US dollars, or other national currencies, it must also be converted according to the value of the franc. If the total amount exceeds 500 francs, the excess amount will be confiscated in full. Therefore, the overseas Chinese who returned to the country from France this time did not carry the excess funds that exceeded the limit for export. Some overseas Chinese, fearing that it would be difficult to return to France in a short period of time after returning to the country, collectively handed over the amount exceeding the limit to the French customs, who issued a receipt so that they could wait for remittance after returning to the country. They are currently in Shanghai waiting to receive it.</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Rumor of Dime Coins Flowing into the Occupied Areas; All are Excuses of Hoarders; Storing in Batches is a Fact; But the Panic Can Be Resolved Soon <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The panic of the lack of dime coins in the market seems to be愈演愈烈 (becoming more and more intense). According to a Datong News Agency reporter's observation in the market yesterday, the smoke and exchange industry had to post several points of premium for exchanging national currency for dime coins. Stores need to give change of more than three or four dimes when buying goods, and some businesses have actually given up operating because they cannot give dime coins. According to general discussions, the reasons for the shortage of dime coins have become complicated. It is said that many people are storing them in batches, waiting for them to become rare goods. Some say that flowing into the occupied areas is completely an excuse. Therefore, those who tie the bell must untie it. General hoarders and colleagues in the smoke and exchange industry should bear considerable responsibility and should come out and use them urgently. As for the fifty-cent subsidiary coins, the China Farmers Bank has already supplied them for exchange, and one-cent and two-cent banknotes will soon be transported from Hong Kong to Shanghai by the Central Bank for relief. Therefore, the above panic is believed to be resolved soon.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Military Administration, in order to requisition wartime sanitary personnel to take on the work of delivering medicines and providing medical care, has specially drafted measures and issued them to the health authorities of various provinces, cities, and counties to handle the requisition matters. Those who graduated from military medical schools and military medical training classes, currently hold external positions, or have been practicing for less than 58 years should be transferred first. Licensed physicians, pharmacists, medical agents, nurses, etc., should be preferentially transferred by the provincial government within the percentage designated by the Central Government. Except for those who are certified to be delayed due to illness, those who fail to handle matters properly, or engage in favoritism and malpractice, and those who are requisitioned and evade or refuse on the grounds of excuses, will be punished separately in accordance with the Regulations on Punishment of Military Service in the Army and the Regulations on Punishment of Crimes against Military Service. Regarding the duties of those who are enlisted, the provincial, municipal, and county governments will notify their service units to retain their positions and suspend their salaries until the time of demobilization. The reporting location for those who are enlisted is the military medical offices in various provinces designated by the Central Military Medical Department. In order to facilitate the actions of those who are enlisted, the provincial and municipal governments order them to concentrate in one place and then depart. Travel expenses are issued by the county and municipal governments. After arriving at the office, the waiting period is called military medical reserve personnel, learning military etiquette and sanitation duties. As for the work treatment, it is as follows: A. Graduates of medical schools approved by domestic and foreign governments will be assigned to work with the following treatment: (1) Those who have not held medical positions will be treated as first-class assistants; (2) Those who have held medical positions for more than three years will be treated as third-class officers; (3) Those who have held medical positions for more than five years will be treated as second-class officers; (4) Those whose academic skills are indeed excellent will be treated according to the Provisional Rules for Specialist Military Physicians. B. Graduates of medical schools not approved by the Ministry of Education and non-formal medical schools will be assigned to work with the following treatment by analogy: (1) Those who have not held medical positions will be treated by analogy to second-class assistants or third-class assistants; (2) Those who have held medical positions for more than two years will be treated by analogy to second-class assistants; (3) Those who have held medical positions for more than three years will be treated by analogy to first-class assistants; (4) Those who have held medical positions for more than five years or whose academic skills are indeed excellent will be treated by analogy to third-class officers. C. Graduates of nursing schools registered by the Ministry of Education will be assigned to work by analogy as follows: (1) New graduates will be treated by analogy to third-class assistants; (2) Those who have served for more than two years will be treated by analogy to second-class assistants;</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Postal Administration resumed telegraphic remittances to various places in November of last year, it has been quite convenient to send money back and forth. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, regarding telegraphic remittances to Guangdong, due to the obstruction of transportation between Shanghai and Guangdong, postal and telecommunications exchanges are not without difficulties. From now on, telegraphic remittances from Shanghai to Guangdong or from Guangdong to Shanghai will be temporarily suspended. It is reported that telegraphic remittances are currently not available to the following provinces and cities: Beiping, Hankou, Xiamen, Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Kaifeng Jiangxi. The usual remittance fee is 1.25 yuan and a handling fee of 10 cents for no more than 20 characters, and 12.5 cents will be added for each additional character.

<h3 id="e71">Japanese Troops Landed in Beihai; The Purpose is to Cut off the Longyong Road <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Written by John Ahlers, translated from the Miller's Review</p>
<p>(Continued) The Japanese troops set out from Tokyo Bay, aiming for the Longyong Road, hoping to cut off this vital transportation artery for "Free China," and took this action in a timely manner to prevent the direct transportation of railways passing through Guangxi Province between Haiphong and Hengyang from being realized. The location where the French railway enters Yunnan is more than 300 miles from the coast, far beyond the reach of the Japanese troops landing in Tokyo Bay, but once the Japanese troops tried to invade the mountainous area between Guangdong and Guangxi and descend into the Youjiang River basin, then the Longyong Road, only 100 miles from the coast, would be difficult to defend effectively. Yongning itself is only 70 miles directly from Qinzhou, which was occupied by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the entire economy of "Free China," the Beihai-Qinzhou area and the Longzhou-Yongning area are insignificant in other aspects except for the direct transportation of the latter. This transportation is only a small part related to the economy of Guangxi. The military equipment imported through Longzhou is distributed to the Guangxi Army and the Central Army, but almost all other goods imported through Longzhou pass through Liuzhou, Guilin, and Guiyang into Sichuan. Guangxi is a fundamentally poor province with very limited economic resources and possibilities. Although agriculture and animal husbandry occupy an important position, the forms and methods are still clumsy. Wuzhou and Yongning on the West River have unimportant agricultural and manufacturing industries, which are still small in scale, and not much tungsten ore is mined. Guangxi's trade and banking industries are old-fashioned and very inflexible. General Li Zongren and General Bai Chongxi prohibited the accumulation of significant amounts of funds in Guangxi Province. Guangxi currency can often be obtained in large quantities for military use; and almost no funds are used for any new commercial investment.</p>
<p>The lack of funds in Guangxi has made the central government's efforts to gradually break down the province's isolation and autonomy proceed smoothly. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the central government immediately began to economically penetrate Guangxi by means of credit loans and other financial assistance. The Central Government's Bank of China and the Bank of Communications subscribed for 17 million yuan of Guangxi government bonds, and the income was used as the reserve for Guangxi banknotes. The circulation of legal tender gradually spread throughout Guangxi, and people have gradually accepted the official price of one yuan of legal tender for two yuan of Guangxi currency. Government banks also assisted in the issuance of two other batches of Guangxi government bonds, each worth 15 million yuan, and established branch banks in larger cities in Guangxi. As for the construction of new railways in Guangxi, the province only provides unskilled labor. Other expenses, such as railway tracks, trains, and engineers, are provided by the central government. The central government also funded the construction of the Longyong Road and the highway from Wuzhou to Xindu (transliteration). The Central Agricultural Affairs Bureau lent 5 million yuan of rural loans to Guangxi farmers, and this year allocated 2 million yuan for the West River area irrigation plan. Among the industrial projects recently implemented by the central government in Guangxi, the most outstanding is the construction of a modern large sugar refinery in an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>However, Guangxi is still an economically backward province, and its contact with the new economic development of "Free China" is far less than that of Sichuan and other provinces. Guangxi has a strong military force, and there will be fierce battles if the Japanese army invades, but since Guangxi is relatively poor, the hope of the Japanese army obtaining any important spoils of war is also small. Under these circumstances, if the Japanese army can achieve the purpose of seizing or blocking the Longyong Highway, it will probably be satisfied. (End)</p>

<p>Since the day before yesterday, the north wind has been howling in this city, the temperature has suddenly dropped, and it has become even colder day by day. Accumulated water has frozen into solid ice, which is the only thing seen since the beginning of winter this year, resulting in as many as fifty or sixty homeless people and beggars freezing to death on the roadside, a situation that is extremely tragic. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>North Wind Howls, Temperature Drops Suddenly</p>
<p>Since the morning of the day before yesterday, after the weather cleared up in this port, the northwest wind suddenly rose, and the temperature dropped suddenly. By yesterday, the north wind was still strong, and the weather was chilling, becoming even colder. The indoor temperature was only 40 degrees, and the outdoor temperature was only a little less than 30 degrees. Therefore, the accumulated water on the roadside actually froze into solid ice, which is really the only thing seen since the beginning of winter this year. Recently, due to the cold air currents from Siberia pushing towards northern China, the temperature in various places in North China, such as Pingjin, has fallen to freezing point. Affected by the howling northwest wind in this port, the temperature has also suddenly decreased. Within 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was only 38.5 degrees, and the lowest was 28 degrees.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Beggars Freeze to Death in the Streets</p>
<p>As a result, beggars who are homeless on the streets are starving and freezing in the severe cold, and most of them are frozen stiff. Yesterday morning, police officers from the French Concession found the corpses of these people frozen to death near Medilan Road, Zhengjia Muqiao, Pingjili Road, and Avenue Joffre. After counting them, there were as many as fourteen. Afterwards, they were all transported by car to the Tongren Fuyuantang in Ningbo Road for burial. At the same time, in the Public Concession, beggars were also found frozen to death on the side of the road in Zhejiang Road, Daxin Street, etc. It is said that the Pushan Villa collected more than 30 frozen-to-death bums and beggars in one day yesterday. However, the weather was even colder yesterday, and some unfortunate beggars struggling on the starvation line may still become frozen corpses.</p>

<p>Liu Ni, a woman from Yangzhou (36 years old), recently came to Shanghai from her hometown to take refuge. She and her husband, Liu Rongsheng, temporarily lived in a thatched cottage built by poor people in Keneng Road. Every day, she went to the Santai Wharf on North Suzhou Road to sweep up rice, beans, wheat, etc., to bring back for cooking. On the 12th of this month, while competing to sweep up rice at the wharf, she was pushed to the ground by her companion, Li Liang, a 44-year-old woman from Anhui who lived next door, and suffered serious injuries. Later, her husband, Liu Rongsheng, transported her by car to the First Refugee Hospital on North Xizang Road for treatment, but she died at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. The corpse was transported to the Corpse Examination Office on Jiaozhou Road. At the same time, her husband, Liu Rongsheng, reported the situation to the Huisi Police Station, who sent detectives to the thatched cottage on Keneng Road and arrested Li Liang, bringing her to the police station and escorting her to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Station Lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and requested detention. Liu Rongsheng, the husband of the deceased, testified about the process and questioned Li Liang. Li Liang's confession was evasive, denying that she had pushed Liu Ni to the ground that day, and asked for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered her to be returned to custody, pending further verification of Liu Ni's corpse.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Number of Criminal Cases in the Concession Has Increased Sharply; Prisons are Overcrowded; An Increase of 4,000 People Compared to Before the War; Judicial Authorities are Implementing Parole <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, people from the interior have flocked to Shanghai to take refuge. The population of this city has suddenly increased sharply, and due to the large number of unemployed people, the quality of society is uneven. Therefore, the number of criminal records has also increased day by day. Before the war, there were 4,000 criminals in the British Concession Prison and about 1,000 in the French Concession Prison, but after the war, the number of prisoners in the prisons in both districts increased sharply, and there was a great concern about overcrowding. In order to adapt to the environment, the judicial authorities have separately implemented amnesty, parole, and bail. Those who have served two-thirds of their sentence, have good conduct, and are first-time offenders are given an opportunity to reflect. Since the implementation of this measure, two or three thousand people have been released. However, the number of detainees still reaches 7,000 in the British Concession and 2,000 in the French Concession. The detention centers of the police station, which originally held four people in each room, have also increased to more than ten people. Therefore, the prison authorities of both prisons still hold several parole sessions every month, and invite personnel from the Salvation Army to give speeches at the time of release, in order to reform and start a new life, and strive to learn well. If they still stubbornly refuse to repent, then it is decided that after being arrested, the unfulfilled sentence must still be carried out as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e75">A Rice Shop Owner Refused to Recognize His Own Daughter; He Filed an Appeal After Losing the Lawsuit <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Huiming, the 42-year-old owner of Dongcheng Rice Shop at 120 Ganshi East Road in the French Concession, from Baoshan, met Chen Qinbao, a woman from Suzhou (27 years old this year), in February 1936. Because he admired Chen's beauty, he seduced her in every possible way, and then rented a house at 5 Weihefang, Fangbang Road, and lured Chen to live with him. Chen became pregnant not long after living with Zhang, and gave birth to a daughter on January 4 of the following year at the Sino-German Hospital, named Zhang Gendi, who is now four years old. After Chen gave birth to her daughter, Zhang suddenly regarded Chen as a worn-out fan. After being abandoned, Chen was extremely angry. This summer, she hired Lawyer Shen Zongyong to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Zhang Huiming of refusing to recognize his biological daughter. After the court heard the case, it ruled that Zhang Huiming lost the lawsuit. Zhang refused to accept the ruling and recently hired Lawyer Zhuang Dingxun to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court, still denying that Zhang Gendi was his biological daughter. The case was recently heard by Xia Quande, the head of the Civil Court of the Third Branch of the High Court, accompanied by a judge and clerk. Chen Qinbao and Zhang Gendi still commissioned Lawyer Shen Zongyong to appear in court, detailing that Zhang Gendi was indeed Zhang Huiming's biological daughter. The court advised both parties that the case concerned personal matters and that reconciliation was the best solution, and then announced that the case would be postponed and the parties would try to reconcile out of court. If reconciliation was hopeless, the trial would continue. After the announcement, the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Mao Jinsheng, a Chinese detective from the French Concession Police Station, and detectives Ke Siqing and Ke Siqi, learned on the 24th of this month that Faxing Pawnshop on Diandang Street, Xinkang Inn on Minguo Road, and Shunhe Hotel on Xujiahui Road were all hiding places for gangs of thieves. Therefore, they went to search at the addresses separately, and arrested Chen Peiyi, Zhao Wenkui, Qian Zhaochang, Yu Songmao, Wang Liangren, Li Xinbi, Gao Mingxiu, Chen Baoyuan, Xu Jian, Chen Zijin, Cao Jiatang, Wang Deming, Liu Xiaowuzi, Zhu Changlong, and a total of fourteen other people, and seized a large number of stolen goods such as silk fabrics, Chinese and Western clothes, cigars, and cigarettes.

After Judge Sun Pengxian interrogated them separately, he ordered them to be returned to custody, pending further questioning at a later date. As for the stolen goods, the police station is now very eager for the owners to go to the Detective Division of the Central Police Station in Lujiawan with a list to claim them.</p>

<p>Shanxi Road Bridge, which spans the Suzhou River, has been closed since the middle of last month due to damage to the bridge and the start of repairs. It is now learned that the repair project has been fully completed yesterday, and traffic can resume today. In addition, because the bridge cannot carry too much weight, cargo trucks are prohibited from driving over the bridge. As for the Jiangxi Road Bridge, it has recently been closed for minor repairs. Both ends of the bridge are blocked by wire mesh. It is said that because the north side of the bridge is a Japanese military police area, it is now necessary to detour to the Tianhou Palace Bridge from Jiangxi Road to North Jiangxi Road. The saying that traffic will resume regularly yesterday must be postponed.</p>

<p>(Yinxian News) Because Ningbo has suffered repeated bombings, the people are dispersed to the interior. The county authorities, to help elementary school children who have dispersed with their families to the countryside, have formulated important matters to be noted by elementary schools at all levels and methods for auditing classes. The following are excerpts from various points: (1) The above-mentioned children can enroll in nearby schools at the place of relocation by presenting a borrowing certificate from their original school without having to pay tuition again. (2) If the above-mentioned children pass the graduation examination of the school where they are auditing classes, they can request the original school to issue a certificate based on their report card. (3) The term examination grades of the above-mentioned children at the school where they are auditing classes will be counted as the term examination grades of the original students when they return to their original school. (4) Public and private elementary schools at all levels in the countryside should accommodate the above-mentioned children as much as possible, classifying them into different grades according to their original school level. (5) Elementary schools at all levels that accommodate auditing students must report the number of auditing students to the county government for record and may request the county government to transfer surplus teachers from elementary schools at all levels in the urban area to serve as teachers. It is also heard that this measure will soon be issued by the county government for implementation.</p>

<p>As for the reward for successful placement, whether it tends toward the job seeker's expectations or approaches the regulations of the recruiting agency, this can be compared in Tables 58 and 11.3. The percentage difference between job seekers who hope to get a reward of ten yuan or less and employers who are willing to offer this amount is very small, so there is no need to discuss it. For rewards of eleven to twenty yuan, job seekers who hope to get this amount account for 29.4%, and employers willing to offer this amount account for 14.65%, while successful placements also account for about 14%, which can be said to be extremely close to the employer's regulations. For rewards of 21 to 30 yuan, job seekers account for 17.8%, employers account for 7.7%, and successful placements account for 6.1%, which is slightly less than the regulations but far from the expectations. For rewards of 31 to 40 yuan, job seekers account for 7.3%, and employers account for about 19.4%, while successful placements account for 1.1%, which is also close to the percentage of employers. Looking at 41 to 50 yuan, job seekers account for 5.11%, employers account for 25.01%, and successful placements also account for 21.1%. This also proves that the reward for successful placement tends toward the employer's side. The other numbers are roughly the same. The reason is that the power of economics is in the hands of the employer, so job seekers naturally have to be more accommodating.</p>

Tongji came to Kunming relatively late, so it was not easy to find a superior school site, resulting in fragmentation. The school's colleges of engineering, science, and medicine, as well as the vocational high school attached to it, teach in five locations, each managing itself. The school building facilities are not very complete. The dormitory and classrooms of the attached high school are far apart. Now, Yiliang Goujie Town in the countryside has been selected, and the school building is used as a temple. At the end of October, teachers, students, and school equipment were moved there one after another. However, because various facilities have not been fully prepared, the original opening date of November 1st has been delayed. However, it will open soon.</p>

<p>The Jingwu Athletic Association, in order to celebrate the new building of the gym, held a members' individual table tennis championship in the gym at 9:00 AM yesterday to commemorate the occasion. More than 200 spectators from all walks of life watched with great enthusiasm. Unfortunately, the absence of strong players Ouyang Wei, Liang Shaoxiang, and Li Runcun reduced the excitement. Chairman Liang Jintang delivered a speech first, followed by referees Chen Linsheng and Ding Du giving the order to start the game. The competition adopted a knockout system to produce the champion and runner-up, so the players fought fiercely. Unfortunately, Guangdong team strong players were defeated by Rong Deneng, a good cutter, one after another, which was a pity. Another newcomer, Qian Yushu, relied on his skilled counter-draw and defeated strong pullers Fang Guanxin and Gui Jiying, and competed with Rong Deneng for the championship. Qian, a newborn calf not afraid of tigers, gave Rong a very strong blow and had hopes of winning. However, due to insufficient experience, he changed his tactics and lost to Rong by one to three. Qian failed at the last moment and retreated to the runner-up position. Rong Deneng won the championship with an undefeated record and will be awarded a prize on a scheduled date.</p>

<p>There were two preliminary matches in the Elementary Cup soccer tournament yesterday. Youyou and Ruowensi met at Jiaozhou Park. The two sides met in the Group C league match last week, and Youyou won 2-1. Yesterday, they competed again in the Cup match. Ruowensi fought bravely, hoping to avenge their defeat. In the first half, Youyou was against the wind. Sun Huipei scored first, followed by Ruowensi's right forward Brownlo and Yuan Kuntian, giving Youyou a 2-1 lead. Unexpectedly, one minute before the end of the first half, Wang Caigao held the ball and ran four steps and was penalized a wall ball, less than two yards from the goal. Jin shot hard and the ball bounced out, and was finally swept in, ending the first half with a score of 2-2. In the second half, Youyou was in a favorable position against the wind and controlled the whole game. Ruowensi could hardly cross the center line. Then Zhou Qilin, Han Longhai, and Sun Huipei scored five goals in succession, winning 7-2. One of Han Longhai's goals was shot from more than 30 yards away. Ruowensi's left defender's double mistake was absurd. Zhou Qilin's second goal was shot by Hu Youcheng from the center field, hit the crossbar, and Zhou rushed into the net. Sun Huipei's second goal was blown in by the wind, which was also ridiculous. Youyou is expected to win the Elementary Cup this season. In another Elementary Cup match yesterday, Russian Overseas also defeated Qiaodengsi 7-2. The score was the same as the match between Youyou and Ruowensi, which was also a coincidence.</p>

<h3 id="e102">A Plan to Balance Rice Prices <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Leti</p>
<p>Balancing rice prices is the unanimous call of all citizens. What is needed now is a practical and effective solution. I dare to offer my humble opinion for reference by all sectors.</p>
<p>Unclogging the Source</p>
<p>The imbalance between supply and demand allows unscrupulous merchants to manipulate prices, so the general public advocates unclogging the source. With the source open, rice prices will naturally be balanced. There is no dispute on this point. But at present, this proposition, like increasing production, is a high-sounding one. It should be known that the Japanese puppets' obstruction of the source is intended to harm the livelihoods of the citizens of Shanghai. We cannot negotiate with the tiger for its skin, nor can we wait until the victory of the war of resistance. Therefore, we can only take advantage of the weakness of the Japanese puppets, who must constantly extort money to maintain their income, to ensure a steady flow of rice production from the occupied areas to Shanghai. What is this method? Only by adopting a scorched-earth determination and implementing a joint procurement or joint cessation of procurement method can we achieve this goal. This requires a strong organization.</p>
<p>Guild System</p>
<p>The government's power is far away from Shanghai, so the general public advocates handing over the control to the various trade associations. It should be known that trade associations are originally organizations of free economy. Their main purpose is to seek the interests of the industry. However, the so-called interests, like speculation, can be divided into spot and futures. Abandoning immediate profits for long-term profits is not something that can be done without foresight; nor can it be understood by ordinary merchants in general; and the benefits of controlled economy mostly belong to futures. The guild has no power to force its members to execute laws. Therefore, it is clear that the guild has no ability to control rice prices.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities</p>
<p>The current concession authorities have many things to do, but the price of rice, which is related to the people's food, is as important as the work of security; this is not only for the sake of social security, but also for the prosperity of the social economy. Because expensive rice will make all things more expensive, and the general purchasing power will fall even more. If this continues, the current prosperity will inevitably go bankrupt; this is exactly what the Japanese puppets are seeking. Since the guild is unable to control rice prices, the only ones who can do so are the authorities of the two concessions; moreover, whether the rice price returns to normal or not is closely related to the security and interests of the concession, as mentioned above, and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Realistic Approach</p>
<p>Some people have requested the concession to set up grain storage, which is a high-sounding proposition and provides unscrupulous merchants with an excuse to manipulate prices. This is because of the fear of injuring the vase when trying to kill the rat, and of startling the snake when beating the grass. Moreover, in fact, there are plenty of warehouses available in the concession, so there is no need to start from scratch. And we know for sure that the existing grain reserves are enough to last for four or five months; so there is no need to panic so much. The current problem is:</p>
<p>(1) To force rice prices back to normal, it is necessary to control rice first.</p>
<p>(2) To maintain a fixed reserve, it is necessary to implement joint procurement first.</p>
<p>(3) To eradicate the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, it is necessary to reorganize the rice market.</p>
<p>Therefore, the author once suggested on a certain occasion that "checking storage," "setting a public price," "unifying procurement and transportation," and implementing a "rice industry licensing system" should all be handled by a committee specially set up by the concession authorities and staffed by impartial people.</p>
<p>Checking Storage</p>
<p>This is not only necessary for regulating the supply and demand of grain, but also the most effective way to expose unscrupulous merchants who manipulate rice prices and then punish them. Therefore, the purpose of the inspection is here. Even if the amount of rice stored is large, there is no need to announce it. The authorities controlling rice prices should be responsible to the entire city for maintaining the publicly set price and how to maintain the publicly set price. If they use the amount of rice stored to stabilize people's hearts, they will again make the mistake of startling the snake when beating the grass. The reason why past announcements of the amount of rice stored were suitable for creating air for unscrupulous merchants lies here. The method of checking storage is:</p>
<p>(1) Issue a notice to all rice merchants and warehouse owners in the city to report the amount of rice stored to the concession authorities within ten days and register it. Late registrations will be rejected.</p>
<p>(2) During the registration and inspection period, the stored rice must not be moved, but the number of pieces that each rice merchant can take out to the market shall be stipulated.</p>
<p>(3) Once the registration is completed, the inspection will begin. Those who underreport will have their stored rice exceeding the registered number confiscated and used for price stabilization; or used as a reserve for public warehouses.</p>
<p>Public Rice Price</p>
<p>The limit price system has the disadvantage of being too fixed and easily unsuitable for reality. And once the market price approaches the limit price, people panic. Unscrupulous merchants can take the opportunity to act. Therefore, we should adopt a public rice price system in the future. The public rice price does not need to return to the full incoming price at present. Because the high price of rice is actually caused by the mutual cause and effect between unscrupulous merchants and the Japanese puppets. This point has been explained in detail in the past week of this publication in the previous issue, so I will not repeat it here. In short: 14 yuan per dan of rice is definitely not too low. The hoarders deserve to lose money because of their high incoming prices. Since the public rice price in Shanghai is low, the extortion of the Japanese puppets will also have its limits. However, the implementation of a public rice price without the backing of forced sales and joint procurement cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>Forced Sales</p>
<p>Therefore, the amount of rice stored obtained from the inspection must be allocated to each household according to the actual needs of the market, and the execution must be enforced. However, when allocating the amount of sales proportionally, it is also possible to examine their usual accounts to find an average transaction amount and handle it.</p>
<p>Joint Procurement</p>
<p>Harming the livelihood of Shanghai citizens is one of the reasons why the Japanese puppets obstruct the transportation of rice to Shanghai. However, they also have the weakness of having to release rice for export in order to obtain extortion income. However, during free procurement, they can blackmail them individually and do whatever they want. As a result, the incoming prices vary, and rice prices increase without decreasing. However, during unified procurement, they can no longer use their usual skills. In the beginning of the implementation, they will definitely make things difficult. But we should have the determination to break the cauldron and sink the boat, rather eat expensive foreign rice than give in. Those who give in must be the Japanese puppets and not this city. Because the only way for rice production in the occupied areas at present is to be transported to Shanghai. The Japanese's purchase is also nothing more than to resell it to Chinese merchants in Shanghai. Transporting it back to Japan or transferring it to the Japanese military rations are all fabrications by unscrupulous merchants, which can be verified by Japanese customs records. If Shanghai does not import rice, farmers in the occupied areas will be restless as a result. This is not what the Japanese puppets want to hear, and they cannot tolerate it even more without extortion income. Since we have this determination, judging from the current rice storage situation, it is not necessary to eat expensive foreign rice immediately. Even if it is necessary, it will be four or five months later. I am afraid that the Japanese puppets will not be able to persist during this period and will give in immediately.</p>
<p>Licensing System</p>
<p>The above methods cannot be stopped because of the opposition or non-cooperation of rice merchants. If this situation occurs, it is possible to cancel their business licenses; and implement a licensing system. Grant licenses to a number of merchants in the city to handle the rice industry. Although this method has the danger of monopoly; it is definitely not a problem under a public rice price. Like today's water and electricity, fortunately, it is a monopoly enterprise, so citizens have not been oppressed by relentless price increases.</p>
<p>Consumer Cooperation</p>
<p>The above methods should be carried out quickly, but whether the seat concession authorities can adopt them? There may be problems. Therefore, we should also be prepared to prevent the concession authorities from failing to handle it. The most effective way to prepare is for all sectors to quickly handle consumer cooperation. The method is:</p>
<p>Major businesses, factories, or school organizations should immediately carry out joint procurement cooperation for all employees. This joint procurement should be carried out directly to the place of production. Whether it is domestic rice or foreign rice, only direct procurement can avoid the interference of unscrupulous merchants. However, it is difficult for individuals to carry out it alone.</p>
<p>However, employees have limited income, and joint procurement is inevitably restricted by cash; this depends on the understanding of the capital side and other authorities, and mutual cooperation. It should be known that rather than paying rice subsidies due to expensive rice, or responding to requests for wage increases; it is better to assist employees in joint procurement, which can stabilize rice prices and be a one-time solution.

<h3 id="e103">Should Shanghai's National Industries Be Maintained? <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>The August 13th Incident erupted, and most of the national industries in Shanghai and the surrounding areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were destroyed by airplanes and artillery. At that time, the government, considering the unpredictable future of the situation, planned to move factories along the coast inland, preparing to rebuild them in the southwest and northwest, in order to preserve strength and enhance resistance. Unexpectedly, in November of the 26th year (1937), the war situation changed abruptly, and the battle line moved westward. At this time, some of the factories in Shanghai and along the Shanghai-Nanjing line had not yet been completely relocated. In the chaos of war, transportation was blocked, and it became almost impossible to move the heavy equipment inland via Hong Kong. Therefore, rather than dismantling the machinery and transporting it inland, it was more cost-effective to start anew inland and rebuild. At the same time, in order to maintain the livelihoods of employees and preserve the original market, it was necessary to salvage what remained and move to the Shanghai concessions, seeking to partially resume operations. These factories, which had survived the ravages of war and were rebuilding, accounted for the majority of Shanghai's industry after the war. After the spring of the 27th year (1938), the exchange rate of the national currency fell, and prices soared. The sales of manufactured goods from the rear became quite strong; at the same time, due to the boycott of Japanese goods, Hong Kong and various Nanyang ports also absorbed a large number of national goods. At this time, the population of Shanghai also increased sharply, and the demand for supplies grew. Under these favorable circumstances, a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand for national goods was created. Where there is profit, people will flock to it. Within this year, new small factories sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain. And most of them had surpluses; in this way, a small-scale prosperous situation in industry was formed. Statistics show that by the end of the 27th year, the number of factories in the Shanghai concessions had reached more than 4,700, more than double the number before the war, and only more than 800 fewer than the total number of factories in the city before the war.</p>
<p>Current Difficulties</p>
<p>The products of Shanghai's national goods factories, in addition to supplying the consumption of the people in the concessions and being shipped to various Nanyang ports, were mainly sold to the rear. Although the raw materials for national goods had to rely on imports to some extent due to geographical restrictions, the capital for setting up factories and the labor for manufacturing were all owned by the Chinese. Therefore, buying products from Shanghai factories was about 30% cheaper in foreign exchange than buying purely foreign goods. From this point of view, it seems necessary to maintain the current national goods factories in Shanghai. Although the government's relocation westward meant that it could not temporarily reach Shanghai, as long as the leaders of the national industries in the special zone were loyal and maintained their integrity, they would still be our productive force; there is no reason for the people to firmly believe in them and the government to abandon them first. For the past two years, the economic and administrative authorities have consistently adhered to this position. They have carefully reviewed and effectively approved applications from Shanghai factories for registration certificates, etc., which is truly worthy of our praise. However, on the other hand, Shanghai's industrial sector has been encountering great difficulties in the past year: first, the problem of remittances from the interior to the port; second, the problem of capital supply.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the remittance problem. The reason why Shanghai factories need remittances from the rear to the port stems from the following two facts: (1) Those who have already established branch factories in the rear, or are building branch factories, must remit funds from the rear to Shanghai and Hong Kong to prepare for the purchase of raw materials, the addition of equipment, and the payment of transportation costs. This need, I am afraid, exists for all factories in the rear, including state-owned factories. (2) After the factories in Shanghai transport their products to the interior for sale, the proceeds must be remitted back to the Shanghai factories to prepare for the purchase of raw materials, the payment of wages and transportation costs, and the maintenance of the continuous turnover of the factory. However, since the government tightened control over foreign exchange, the Financial Supervisory Bureau, in order to prevent capital flight, strictly restricted the remittance of national currency to the port. The inland branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank did very little Shanghai-Hong Kong remittance business each day, and refused to accept remittances beyond the limit without any reason. In Chongqing and other ports, there were often people who wanted to remit 100 yuan of legal tender to Shanghai, waiting from dawn to noon, and being turned away repeatedly for several days. As for commercial banks, although they could accept remittances within a certain limit, the remittance fees were shockingly high. Under these circumstances, it was impossible for factories in the interior to purchase raw materials and machinery and pay the necessary transportation costs at the port; it was also impossible for factories in Shanghai to remit the proceeds from sales in the interior back to the Shanghai factories to continue production and supply the rear. We believe that the financial authorities' approach of "abandoning food because of choking" needs to be reconsidered and improved. Because if some or all of the factories in the interior need to use foreign raw materials, they will of course have to close down once the supply is cut off. New factories will not be able to purchase equipment at the port and will have to suspend construction. If factories in Shanghai cannot transport their proceeds to Shanghai, they can only reduce production and seek other ways to compensate. The resulting situation will inevitably lead to soaring prices of manufactured goods in the interior, and even a break in supply, which will further deteriorate the lives of the people, or it is not impossible for foreign goods to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>The second problem is the capital supply problem. Statistics show that after August 13th in Shanghai, the number of bank deposits and inventories increased significantly compared to before the war. On the demand side, some industries have been destroyed by artillery fire, so the number of lending targets has decreased. The local products in the vicinity of Shanghai are subject to Japanese control and cannot be freely transported and sold; the imported foreign goods have also shown a decrease due to a sharp decrease in demand; therefore, the banks' commodity loans have also decreased significantly. In this way, with the supply of funds exceeding demand, the industrial sector, which is solid in content and legitimate in business, should theoretically be able to obtain a sufficient supply of funds; however, in reality, this is not the case. Despite the fact that bank funds are idle and the New Remittance Plan of 50 million yuan from the Joint Reserve Committee has not been used up to half, all banks are making every effort to shrink their loans to factories and avoid them as if they were plagues after the Ministry of Finance's telegram restrictions on withdrawals; it is said that even those who had already signed overdraft contracts were stopped from continuing to be accommodated. Under this kind of pressure, the suffering of the industrial sector is not difficult to imagine. And looking back at the speculative market, since the outbreak of the European War, there have been many people who have competed to buy foreign exchange and hoard goods, hoping to profit from speculation, especially people engaged in the financial sector. We cannot help but lament the moral decline of the people for this kind of means of harming others and benefiting oneself; moreover, most of the word "benefiting oneself" is still just wishful thinking. The original intention of the Ministry of Finance's telegram was to curb speculation; now, speculation has not disappeared, but industry has been destroyed first; I am afraid that this is also beyond the expectations of the authorities.</p>
<p>The Nature of Isolated Island Industry</p>
<p>Should the government maintain Shanghai's national industry at the current stage? The answer to this question should be given after first examining the current content and production and sales situation of Shanghai factories and the impact on our country's politics and economy, both in terms of advantages and disadvantages. First, let's talk about the production aspect: first, in terms of raw materials, perhaps most factories, due to geographical restrictions, inevitably rely on foreign goods in part or in whole. As long as they do not use Japanese goods, we believe that this method of purchasing foreign raw materials and processing them ourselves can be tolerated during the transition period. Because our country's native products are subject to innate limitations, all factories were already like this before the war, let alone the fact that most of the country that produces raw materials has now fallen. In this regard, a large amount of raw materials must be imported every year; but it is always more cost-effective than importing all foreign manufactured goods. Second is capital. We can assert that all factories run by Chinese are purely Chinese capital, and there are very few joint ventures with foreigners. Third is labor. Currently, the national goods factories in Shanghai can be said to be all Chinese labor, and managed by Chinese, and even foreign technicians are rarely seen. Looking at it from the opposite perspective, if these factories all stop production, wouldn't the unemployment of tens of thousands of employees become an extremely serious social problem? Fourth is land. Factories operating in the Shanghai Special Zone, their factory bases and buildings, are protected by the police power of the concessions, and can still maintain a detached position, not subject to the interference of anyone.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the sales aspect: currently, the sales destinations of Shanghai's national goods factory products are roughly the following: first, the interior of the rear. Daily-use manufactured goods are necessary for the lives of the military and civilians in the rear, and the annual consumption is very large. Before the completion of industrial construction in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, it is not too much to use the favorable production conditions of the Shanghai Special Zone to manufacture daily necessities for the military and civilians in the rear and save the government a huge amount of foreign exchange. Second, Hong Kong and various Nanyang ports. After the depreciation of the national currency exchange rate, it is conducive to export trade. Most of the population in Hong Kong and Nanyang ports are overseas Chinese. Driven by patriotic sentiments, they have boycotted Japanese goods and switched to buying national goods in recent years. Therefore, they have absorbed a large number of products from Shanghai factories, increasing a part of foreign exchange income for our country's international balance of payments, and at the same time laying the foundation for the market for national goods to be sold in the south, relatively weakening the enemy's trade power. Third, the Shanghai Special Zone and various occupied areas. The consumption of more than four million people in the Shanghai Special Zone should be supplied by national goods, which does not need to be repeated. What needs to be studied now is whether national goods should be transported to the occupied areas for sale under possible conditions? At present, most of the people in the occupied areas, except for a very small number of people who work for the enemy, are people who "are in the rivers and lakes, but their hearts are with the imperial court." Therefore, it can be said that although the land has fallen, the people are still ours. With this premise, it is of course appropriate to allow the transportation and supply of national goods, so as to avoid inferior goods from taking their place; as long as the sales organization in the interior is sound and the national goods factories in Shanghai are closely monitored, the danger of aiding the enemy can be prevented. We can perceive the need for this matter simply by thinking about it from the opposite perspective. Assuming that national goods are prohibited from being transported to various war zones, then not only will the mobile troops and the general public not be able to buy national goods for consumption, resulting in creating opportunities for Japanese goods to be dumped, but it will also be enough to weaken the patriotic enthusiasm of the people. Therefore, looking at the occupied areas at the current stage, we cannot find sufficient reasons to prohibit the transportation and sale of national goods.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above analysis, the existence of national industries in the Shanghai Special Zone seems to be more beneficial than harmful to the national economy and cannot be denied. Then, it is of course the government's duty to provide strong relief to the current difficulties of the factories.</p>
<p>Recommendations for Relief Measures</p>
<p>The method of relieving Shanghai's national industries should of course be targeted at the current difficulties, prescribing the right medicine for the illness. In short, it can be divided into:</p>
<p>First, responsible personnel should be dispatched by the central financial and economic administrative authorities to Shanghai to jointly investigate the current production and sales situation and internal organization of various factories with various public organizations in order to understand the true situation of the content.</p>
<p>Second, the central financial authorities should supervise the Joint Office of the Four Banks to notify the branches of each bank in the interior and Shanghai to accept as much as possible applications for remittances from the aforementioned identified factories that have conclusive proof, and implement the "Provisional Measures for Facilitating Domestic Remittances" approved by the Ministry of Finance to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<p>Third, the central financial authorities should order the Four Banks Collateral Committee to expand the Shanghai industrial collateral amount; encourage various commercial banks to jointly handle industrial loans, or organize industrial loan syndicates to lend to factories with solid content and reliable collateral; at the same time, order the Four Banks Collateral Committee and the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Preparatory Committee to use the method of re-mortgage to support commercial banks. This allows funds to be used in a proper way, or may reduce speculative activities.</p>
<p>The above three items are all hoped to be planned and implemented by the government. If you want to get the sympathy and assistance of others, you must first have a sound organization, sufficient public content, and a loyal national concept. We earnestly hope that Shanghai's factories will maintain their integrity, strengthen their determination, rectify their internal affairs, and strive to enhance the strength of the national economy. At the same time, in order to demonstrate fairness, we suggest that you quickly and voluntarily handle</p>
<p>First, organize an industrial joint organization, and invite the Joint Office of the Four Banks, the Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and experts from various industries to participate in a detached position to regularly handle the investigation and identification of the content, production, and sales of various factories, etc., for the consultation of the government and the financial sector. The qualifications for membership must be strict, and it is better to have a shortage than to be lax, so as to avoid abuses. With such an organization in place, the review work in handling remittances and loans may be much more convenient.</p>
<p>Second, Shanghai's factories should settle and sell foreign exchange to the domestic branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's regulations on the settlement and sale of foreign exchange for exported goods, in order to increase the government's foreign exchange income.</p>
<p>In short: the key to winning the War of Resistance is national strength first; on the government's side, rather than passively letting the factories in the special zone fend for themselves, treating them as uncivilized, or even forcing them to take risks, it is better to actively supervise them strictly and support them in order to preserve the country's vitality and enhance the strength of resistance and construction.

<p>The rice market was still tight yesterday morning after it became a sensation again. Upon investigation, the wave of today's price increase of two yuan is nothing more than speculators making trouble, and the general hoarding households also echoed it. Therefore, once the price increase occurs, it is often difficult to contain. The previous price of japonica rice once reached the 40 yuan mark, so everyone believed that this price increase would not be inferior to the past, or even break the mark and create a new peak. Driven by their hopeful thoughts, they immediately ignored everything and searched for rice, creating a good opportunity for out-of-town merchants to profit and lift prices beyond the normal range. As a result, the prices of japonica and indica rice rose sharply by more than two yuan in an instant. However, the thoughts of the general local stores are different. Seeing the market getting higher, they become more discouraged. Because their situation is different, and their capital scope is smaller, they inevitably rely on the market for sales and sell gradually. The outlet is restricted and the cost is quite high. Unlike the general hoarding households, who have sufficient strength, they pull in and throw out, which is flexible and mobile. Therefore, they often encounter changes that are difficult to grasp. Therefore, having learned from previous lessons, they are always cautious. Whenever the price first rises, they also follow the trend of competing for purchases. However, when they see the peak, they all maintain a stable attitude, stand by and watch, and only slightly add to their purchases. Therefore, yesterday's market was sluggish when it was soaring. The local stores were the only ones that were weak because they believed that the profits were small and the burden was heavy. Therefore, after the market had risen sufficiently, the situation stabilized. And the general hoarding households, seeing that the situation had changed, also gradually stopped and transferred their efforts. Until noon, there were few inquiries, and both retail and wholesale markets became stagnant. What was worse, the foreign rice held in the hands of the Beiyang gang was sold off again, falling from 34 yuan to 33 yuan, and people's hearts became more and more empty. If the out-of-town merchants sell off one after another, they will have a lot of remaining goods in their hands. In addition, the goods from Sujia Kuntai Qing Si Feng Lian, etc., arrived in large quantities yesterday, taking advantage of the rising market in Shanghai, with a total of more than 40 cars. The merchants were chilled and eager to unload their goods, and their efforts to unload became even stronger. The hoarding households also withdrew their greed and returned to sell in droves, but there were few transactions. In this chaotic situation, the prices of all goods had fallen back by varying amounts of one or two yuan. As a result, the closing market price, although still increased by 45 cents compared to the previous, can be called stable in terms of the two yuan increase and decrease first and last. The prices were as follows: Changzhen special japonica rice 38 yuan, special japonica rice 37 yuan 30 cents, 37 yuan, Kunsu high japonica rice 36 yuan to 35 yuan 50 cents, Qingjiao special thin rice 334 yuan, Fengjia thin rice 323 yuan, Luyang sharp rice 334 yuan, Jingwu sharp rice opened at 34 yuan in the early market, but only 33 yuan 30 cents and 33 yuan 50 cents later, Saigon and Annam japonica rice 33 yuan to 33 yuan 50 cents.</p>

<p>Codfish is in short supply for a long time, resulting in gradually thin bottom inventory, and high-quality goods are even more scarce. The market situation is tight. Currently, Ningbo codfish is sold at 60 yuan, up 13 yuan from before. Zhoushan goods and Yantai codfish are sold at 100 yuan, rising to a degree of 20 yuan.</p>

<p>Haifeng white coal has been weak in the market recently due to the large amount of arrivals. The market is strong on the outside and dry on the inside, and transactions are also very sluggish. Because both the industry's hoarding customers have a lot of goods in their hands, they are waiting and watching, and the market also dares not take it. The industry splits the price, lump coal is 106 yuan per ton, and hoarding customers sell it for only about 100 yuan. Door-to-door retail, mentioning lump coal is 112 yuan per ton, Lingjiao 116 yuan, and Tong lump 110 yuan, delivered to customers, including industry profits.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Material Utilization Supplement <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Chen Liang's article "Material Utilization" in the previous issue (November 20) of this publication, which talked about how old and broken items can be made useful after being modified, especially for people in the salary class during this extraordinary period, with more than half of their income reduced, the so-called "living within one's means" and "turning waste into useful items" can indeed supplement the economy. Mr. Chen is truly a mindful person. Now I also want to come up with a few discarded items, which can be applied after modification, as a sequel and submit it to this publication. .</p>
<p>Old writing brushes with no nibs are mostly thrown into the wastepaper basket, which is a pity! You may as well accumulate ten or eight, wash the nibs with clean water, arrange them neatly and tie them tightly with thin rope, and you have a row of brushes (also called board brushes), which can be used to dip paste and paste the windows of the room.</p>
<p>When old and broken clothes and socks, etc., cannot be worn again, you can take them to remove the buttons and trims, wash them clean and dry them in the sun, stack them neatly and paste them into "cloth boards" to be used as insoles for children's shoes. If not, tear them into cloth strips and tie them to a round wooden stick to make a broom. Because brooms are heavily worn when wiping the floor, making them extremely easy to break, you can change the worn-out clothes and old socks again, so you don't have to buy broom heads often.</p>
<p>Calendars are changed every year. When changing, the old ones are discarded at hand, which is also a pity! Why not write memos or practice writing on the blank reverse side, its function is no less than tearing a paper notebook. As for the sharpened end of a spent matchstick, it can be used as a toothpick. Some people think it has toxic substances: in fact, after soaking it in clean water for a day or two, and waiting for it to dry, the toxic substances will also be eliminated and it can be used. What's more, high-quality cigar ash is said to be able to brush teeth. Rust-covered cigarette cans can have fine holes chiseled into them and used to water flowers (new ones are even more useful). For other miscellaneous utensils, if they are slightly damaged, repair them if you can repair them, and replace them if you can replace them, always with the principle of saving money. It not only cultivates a good habit of cherishing things, but also is a key to getting through the difficult extraordinary period.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Wool Thread Re-dyeing Method <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Xuehui</p>
<p>It's getting cold, and it's the season for making cold clothes again. Wool thread has become a popular cold-proof product for the people of our country. Almost every child and adult has a wool thread underwear or outerwear, especially women.</p>
<p>However, at a time when foreign exchange is tight and prices are soaring, we have to save a little. Now I offer the old wool thread re-dyeing method to housewives.</p>
<p>Gray: Most suitable for re-dyeing dark gray or neutral color, you can use two cents or one tael of acid neutral color.</p>
<p>Light yellow: Most suitable for re-dyeing golden yellow, group green, coffee, dark green, etc. To dye golden yellow, you can use five cents of acid peach red. To dye emerald green, you can use five cents of emerald green pigment. To dye dark coffee, you can dye with a combination of acid neutral color and acid snuff. If you want to dye dark green, you can use five cents of product blue.</p>
<p>Light green: Most suitable for re-dyeing navy blue, you can dye with a combination of eight cents of acid product blue, two cents of acid neutral color, and two cents of acid vermilion.</p>
<p>Dark red: Most suitable for re-dyeing purple sauce, you can dye with a combination of three cents of acid neutral color and seven cents of acid dark red. In addition, you can also re-dye navy blue.</p>
<p>Other colors such as adzuki bean paste can also be re-dyed dark coffee or navy blue.</p>
<p>The above pigment configuration is calculated according to ten taels of wool thread.</p>
<p>Dyeing method: first soak the wool thread in hot water. Dissolve the pigment in a magnetic cup or bowl with boiling water, put it in a pot or basin, and also put a considerable amount of water in the pot. Then pour the pigment liquid into the pot, and then put the wool thread into the pot. Place it on the stove and slowly turn it to make the heat even. Cook for half an hour. It is better to add a little glacial acetic acid when dyeing.</p>
<p>After taking it out, wash the pigment water clean, and the color will be bright and will not fade.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Walking in the Air <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>Everyone thinks that flying in the air is a very common thing, but I'm afraid there are still many people who don't know about people "walking" in the air! Airplanes can only carry people because they have an engine, and their actions cannot be as arbitrary and satisfying as one would like. Humans have long understood that this is a shortcoming of airplanes. Scientists' minds are especially sharp. They have carefully studied it and improved it bit by bit—the invention of "walking" in the air, called "gliding machine" or glider. Here, I will introduce it.</p>
<p>People who have taken a plane will always feel that when flying at high altitude, everything on the ground is blurry, but the "gliding machine" is not like that. It can glide in the air 70 feet above the ground, it can come in a moment and go in a moment. If you happen to turn around while picking out an object, the object in front of you will suddenly disappear. People who walk in the air with a "gliding machine" are truly immortals and truly demons. I am not talking nonsense, because Europe has already used this kind of machine as a "competition" toy.</p>
<p>The structure of the "gliding machine" is very simple. There is no engine, so no gasoline is needed. It is made of steel pipes or wood into several skeletons, and then two narrow and long wings are installed. It relies on the power of car towing, the power of airplanes taking off, and the power of winch launching to rise into the high air, but soon it gets rid of people's help and can walk leisurely in the air with the drift of the air currents without danger. It is also gentle when landing on the ground. Even a ten-year-old child in England takes this toy, let alone adults. How convenient and economical it would be to put a few "gliding machines" on the top of Mount Tai, Mount Heng, and other scenic mountains in China for tourists to take down the mountain!</p>
<p>It can also change direction when walking in the air. A rudder is installed behind the seat cushion. When people turn the rudder in front, it will follow your wishes.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Ode to Beggar's Chicken <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Beggar's chicken is a specialty of Changshu. It involves covering a plump chicken with mud and baking it in a fire, so the flavor does not escape. When eaten, it has a fragrant aroma and a unique flavor. Previously, to taste this dish, one had to go to Yu Mountain. Now, it is also available in Shanghai. The other day, after eating, Ye Songxian and Miao Yonglou, two poetic elders, praised it incessantly, each composing inscriptions with elegant allusions, making for a delightful anecdote for a cookbook.</p>
<p>(1) The ingredients are taken from the homes of Yue merchants (Yue chickens are plump and tender). The method is fixed to come from the Wu dialect market. (Wu Zixu played the flute in the Wu market and acted as a beggar). There's no need to frequently beg from door to door, acting like a fool about to be sealed in a jar. (2) Bound by clay, not leaking spring's essence, happily taking from the neighbors every day. From now on, I won't eat food that's condescendingly given. Zilu would surely laugh at the old man. (3) The frozen duck is said to be beautiful, like sisters-in-law. The big cooking of Zheng meat is talked about like Dongpo. Since beggar's chicken has arrived, famous scholars and beauties are helpless. (The above three quatrains are by Mr. Ye Songxian.) Once, Dongpo pork was renowned. Now, gluttons add beggar's chicken. Chicken and pork are still chicken and pork in essence. The taste varies depending on the different methods, distinguishing high and low. The noisy chicken seller confronts the chicken buyer. The difference between fragrance and foulness lies in self-cultivation. From this, we know that fools can sometimes get one thing right. Why use a butcher's knife to slaughter a pheasant? Regulating yin and yang by cooking with a lively fire, covered with salt and plums in a mud ball. Though the skin and feathers remain, the heart and intestines have been replaced. Ascending the tripod and cauldron, it replaces Qijie's dwelling. The soft, warm, milky flesh is as beautiful as Yang Guifei. The delicate little tongue is better than Xishi's. (Xishi's tongue is also a dish.) The fragrant, sparse toes have no such taste (sacrificing to the pheasant is called sparse toes). The community banquet will bring wine along. I'm ashamed to Yi Ya claims to know the taste. Even after many cookings, it loses to Bai Lixi. It should be added to Yuan Lang's new cookbook. The beautiful production of Qi is enough to make a wife proud. Try to observe the prime minister of a state wearing a heroic helmet, the minced meat, flute playing, and gifting of silk. The chicken coop is not short of those who haven't danced like cranes. Is butchering dogs only for the pleasure of eating? The prominence and obscurity of people have no fixed fate. Fortunately, fame is achieved through evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Most Suitable Foods for Infants (Part 2) <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Zhu Ye</p>
<p>Cod Liver Oil: It is best to give infants cod liver oil early on, starting with a small amount. By the fourth month, give about three teaspoons a day, or gradually increase the amount from two drops to ten drops. According to Dr. Martha Eliot, start from the third week after birth, half a teaspoon twice a day, one teaspoon twice a day in the second month, and one and a half teaspoons twice a day in the third month. This amount can be continued for two years. Cod liver oil can also be added to milk or orange juice to avoid its fishy smell and make it easier to take. Infants have a strong tolerance for cod liver oil. Therefore, infants with a tendency to rickets, premature infants, and infants with nutritional disorders should take it early.</p>
<p>Vegetable Soup: Vegetable soup should also have meat and grains added to it. For example, add a small amount of chopped beef, mutton, or chicken to green vegetables, along with one potato, one turnip, two tablespoons of rice, and a little salt. Boil with water for three hours. Adding tomatoes and peas is also good. Start giving this vegetable soup from the sixth month, giving two tablespoons with breast milk at 2 PM. Gradually increase to thirty tablespoons, reducing the amount of milk by three tablespoons.</p>
<p>Vegetable Puree: Cook green vegetables into a meat and vegetable puree. If the child has already eaten vegetable soup, give this vegetable puree around the eleventh month. Otherwise, if only eating vegetable puree, start at the sixth month, giving it at 2 PM with breast milk. Initially, give it three times a week, giving spinach. On the other four days, give carrots, peas, asparagus, lettuce, etc., one teaspoon at a time, gradually increasing the amount to one tablespoon in the seventh month, two tablespoons by the eighth month, and three tablespoons by the ninth month. Continue with three tablespoons thereafter. After one year, give pumpkin, white turnip, kohlrabi, cabbage, etc., mixing two or three kinds at a time. The water used to cook the vegetables contains valuable salts and should not be discarded. Mix half a teaspoon of butter with one tablespoon of vegetable puree. This not only makes the vegetable puree taste better, but also increases its nutritional value.</p>
<p>Meat Juice: Chop half a pound of lean beef and extract the juice using a meat juicer. Add a small amount of salt. Start from the fifth or ninth month, one teaspoon a day, gradually increasing the amount to three to six tablespoons. Give it to anemic babies slightly earlier. Sometimes, when the baby has a strong tolerance for meat juice and becomes excited and cannot sleep, temporarily stop giving it.</p>
<p>Egg: First, give the yolk, usually starting from the fifth month. It can be half-cooked or fully cooked. Initially, mix it with orange juice or milk and give it with breast milk at 2 PM. After the yolk is completely tolerated, start giving a very small amount of egg white. By the thirteenth or fourteenth month, give the whole egg.</p>
<p>Bread: Give it after the baby has teeth. First, give toast or crackers.</p>
<p>Fruit: Apples are the most suitable fruit for babies. Start from the tenth month, giving cooked apples or strained cooked apples. Give it at the same time as milk. Bananas should be started from the thirteenth or fourteenth month.</p>
<p>The above is an overview of the various "complementary foods" for infants. However, in cases of illness or special circumstances, it should only be given after guidance from a doctor.</p>
<h3 id="e114">One Week Economic Menu <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>New pickled meat is on the market again. If you're tired of eating fresh meat, why not change your taste and eat some pickled meat? It's very suitable for eating with rice. The weather has suddenly turned cold these few days. A bowl of pickled meat and tofu soup with some fresh garlic is very palatable. However, this soup must be eaten hot. If it's neither hot nor cold, it doesn't taste as good. As for the pickled meat, it doesn't have to be put in the soup. Like Hangzhou-style stewed pork, it can be sliced and eaten separately, which is very chewy. If you like pickled meat but are reluctant to give up fresh meat, then you can have them cooperate and make a bowl of stewed pickled fresh meat. If you want to be more refined, add some diced winter bamboo shoots, and it will naturally be even more delicious. In addition, there is another method: cut the pickled vegetables into small pieces and steam them together with the pickled meat. This is also a good dish to eat with rice. This is Ningbo flavor, and it is expected that Ningbo people will definitely love it. Monday: Pickled meat and tofu soup, salted vegetables with braised yellow croaker, fried day lily, braised radish slices. Tuesday: Shepherd's purse fried pork slices, fragrant mushroom stewed abalone, stir-fried cellophane noodles with green vegetables, spinach with braised tofu. Wednesday: Celery and shredded beef, braised bluefish slices, salted vegetables with soybean sprouts, dried shredded bean curd, golden flower vegetables. Thursday: Pickled vegetables steamed with pickled meat, salted fish stewed tofu, shepherd's purse with bean sprouts, stir-fried chrysanthemum greens. Friday: Dried bamboo shoots fried shredded pork, bean starch sheet with white fish head, vegetarian oil tofu soup, braised cabbage. Saturday: Curry beef slices, small shrimp fried with scrambled eggs, pickled vegetables fried with yam, braised vegetarian assorted delicacies. Sunday: Stewed pickled fresh meat, pan-fried ribbonfish, stir-fried pea sprouts, mung bean sprouts.</p>

<h3 id="e115">The Dime Panic <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>(1) Huang Ziqiang</p>
<p>The panic over fen coins has not been completely resolved yet, but a dime coin panic has now broken out. Buying up copper yuan and fen coins has high profits, so short-sighted businessmen are acting as accomplices, causing temporary chaos in the "isolated island." The current dime panic is certainly caused by more than just this simple reason, but profiting from it and disrupting the market is even worse than during the fen coin panic.</p>
<p>What makes people feel most inconvenience are the small trades at the vegetable market, cigarette exchange shops and medical garden. In the absence of loose fen coins to make change, you have to purchase at least a dime for vegetables, this invisibly raises the cost of living, which makes the lives of ordinary people even harder. But now, it’s even impossible to make sales at the vegetable market. With larger transactions on the fishy stalls, fishmongers have already exchanged some dime coins to maintain business, but it still trades at different rates from 93 cents to 97 cents per yuan. Other small vegetable stalls, because they do not have more capital to exchange dime coins in advance, they can only shake their heads at the banknotes handed up by customers, and these peddlers who get small profits are the ones who suffer the most.</p>
<p>The "exquisite" nature of Shanghai's cigarette exchange shops is well known. When the Central Mint released fen coin notes, the largest discount for one yuan was a dime. Now, purchases of less than five dimes will be discounted by at least five to seven cents. If the trade is only a few cents to a dime, then they rudely refuse, because the items sold in the cigarette exchange shops are daily necessities that are indispensable for home living, and they are not afraid of losing business.</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers are also the most affected class. Because the cost of living has increased, ordinary rickshaw customers have switched to taking the tram, but now the tram ticket sellers are loudly shouting, "Please do not board if you do not have dime coins," and the customers who take rickshaws have naturally decreased even more.</p>
<p>As for all snack and food shops, they have all posted signs at the entrance saying, "A discount of three cents for purchases under five dimes." According to them, they have to pay a discount of five to seven cents when they exchange them. However, the wool comes from the sheep, and the general customer is the one who ultimately suffers the loss.</p>
<p>Therefore, the impact of the dime coin panic is even greater than that of the fen coin panic, because the poorest citizens are the most exploited.</p>
<p>(2) Simon</p>
<p>… However, some businessmen still have a lot of dime coins in their hands, but they have nowhere to spend them. The day before yesterday, I asked for a load of coal balls and took out a ten-yuan banknote, and the coal ball shop owner asked me to pay with two yuan worth of dime coins, which I welcomed. According to him, most of the retail business done at the coal ball shop is mostly one or two dimes, so they have accumulated a lot of dime coins and welcome me to go down and ask them to exchange them. It can be seen that dime coins are not lacking, but it is just that supply and demand is inappropriate, with some places having too much and some places having too little. (Editor: Perhaps this coal ball shop owner's information is not well-informed, and he is probably regretting the invisible loss of the discount on these two yuan of dime coins now.)</p>
<p>It is said that there are many reasons why these dime coins are lacking: some of the tattered dime coins have been recovered, and the new issuance amount is currently not as much as the old ones; the number of dime coins flowing into the occupied areas is very high; and some people are also buying them up, deliberately disrupting the market, hoping that the larger discounts can make money, which is also a major reason. If this is true, then we can only hope that the financial sector can quickly find appropriate countermeasures to reduce the inconvenience of shopping for citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Elimination of Corporal Punishment and the Urgent Abolition of the Expulsion System <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zi</p>
<p>I happened to be talking with a few friends about the issue of schools expelling students. Before the war, many of the more famous secondary and higher schools had vigorously implemented this system, which aroused discussion among people in society about this issue. After the war, in Shanghai, which had become an isolated island, this issue was put aside. Although a certain newspaper had once discussed it some time ago, it still seemed to be inconclusive. Recently, several well-known schools, in order to rectify discipline, still plan to vigorously implement the expulsion system. Therefore, we believe that this is an educational problem that urgently needs to be resolved and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that this system is absolutely contrary to educational principles. The expulsion of students by ordinary schools is nothing more than poor grades and bad conduct. I believe that schools can replace the former with grade retention, so why make them feel the pain of dropping out of school? I also think the latter is unreasonable. Just think, the student's behavior is base, which is the failure of education, and educators and school leaders should blame themselves; education is designed to improve students' academic performance and cultivate moral character, which is also the greatest mission that educators should assume. Because a bad student, are we to let him remain bad forever? Or push the responsibility onto others? If it is because of cherishing one's own or one's school's reputation, and heartlessly watching these fallen students continue to fall, not only not helping them, but kicking them when they're down, this is certainly not right; if it is said that it is to prevent a few bad apples from spoiling the whole bunch, this statement is also too narrow. Just think: why not find a way to make these few inferior students influenced by the majority of good students, but instead fearing that a few will harm the many, this is not the tone that educators should have, right? In the past, there was unanimous opposition to corporal punishment, believing that inflicting physical punishment on students was too contrary to educational principles. I think that expelling students is even more unreasonable than corporal punishment, because once students are expelled, they are simply deprived of the opportunity to correct their mistakes and start anew.</p>
<p>Cao Souyi, the former principal of Zhenjiang Normal School of Jiangsu Province, firmly opposed the expulsion system. He believed that students should be patiently guided and led to self-awareness and self-renewal, and the results were quite effective. At that time, the school had very good discipline. This is one example. Therefore, I feel that the expulsion system for students in schools should be abolished as soon as possible, and it should be included in the ranks of elimination along with the corporal punishment system of the past.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Talking about Economic Prosperity and Old Markets; Describing Marital Plunder and Tracing Back Customs</p>
<p>From Suzhou to Shanghai, it is still the section with the most passengers, so the Suzhou station often prepares one or two carriages there depending on the number of passengers. As long as the train comes, hook it on the back, and it can depart. Wu Junsu often travels between Shanghai and Suzhou, and knows this rule, so he leads them straight to the reserved carriage. At this moment, the train has assigned seating, and the six of them bought tickets together in one place, all with consecutive numbers, so they are naturally sitting together. Because there are more people, it feels even more interesting. After a while, the seats in this reserved carriage are also full. The train also enters the station, hooks up their reserved carriage, and departs. They talk and chat in the carriage, and soon they talk about the He sisters opening a silk weaving factory in Freedom Village. Shao Huihua strongly agrees, saying: "That's right! Why does everyone want to squeeze into Shanghai to open factories? I remember that in 1939 and 1940, it was during the Sino-Japanese War, and Shanghai still had concessions at that time. It was said that the two concessions had a total population of 4.5 million. I was still young at that time. We originally lived in Beiping, but later we fled to Shanghai. When we arrived in Shanghai, the first hardship was that we couldn't find a house. We had to stay in a hotel while looking for a house. Finally, a relative introduced us to a three-story small Western-style building, saying that the landlord was going to Kunming and was willing to lease the house to someone else. My mother contacted them, and the rent, which was usually 65 yuan per month, had now risen to 115 yuan. But we didn't care about that. No matter what, it was still cheaper than staying in a hotel. But when we asked about the key money, we were shocked. They wanted 3,000 yuan. What did 3,000 yuan get us? A telephone, a few electric lights, and a few broken tables. That's all. Later, we found out that it wasn't that the landlord was going to Kunming. He had simply leased it from someone else. However, his key money was much cheaper than the current price. He leased it for less than 1,000 yuan. At most, he paid two months' rent and earned more than 2,000 yuan. He took this opportunity to do business. At that time, during the national crisis, many people took this opportunity to make a fortune, which was called "profiteering from the national crisis." This was also one of them." Wu Junsu is the most impatient person, so he asks: "What happened later? Did you lease a house? We all experienced that kind of refugee era. Maybe the He sisters went abroad from a young age and didn't experience it. When my father talked about this era with me, he said it was a great era. Because at this time, the European War broke out again, and the whole world was in turmoil." (207)</p>
