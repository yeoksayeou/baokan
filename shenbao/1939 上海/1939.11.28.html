<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇芬邊境糾紛</h3>
<p>蘇芬談判，歷時甚久，雖經過幾度專使往返磋商，終以雙方條件，相距甚遠，未有成議。芬蘭當局宣佈仍願與蘇聯繼續談判，然自芬蘭代表返國，迄今已歷二旬之久，雙方重開談判，仍未有端倪。及至前日，又發生邊境衝突。據塔斯社消息，說此次紛擾，「乃芬蘭境內軍隊，突然開砲，向駐紮卡萊里亞地峽曼飛拉村之蘇聯防軍轟擊，開砲共七發，結果蘇方紅軍死者士兵一名，下級司令一名，傷者士兵七名，下級司令一名，少尉一名。」芬蘭方面宣稱，蘇軍從事演習，雙方並無糾紛。關於此事，蘇聯已派人前往調查，並令邊防軍不得還擊。就此次事件本身觀之，或僅屬誤會，而事件不致擴大！不過蘇芬的談判一天不能得到妥協，蘇芬間就一天有發生糾紛的可能。蘇聯必須貫澈它的控制芬蘭灣，使突出波羅的海的大城市列甯格勒及其鄰近的狹長地帶，可以獲得了蘇聯的所謂「安全」而後已。據蘇聯外委莫洛托夫所說「列甯格拉是蘇聯莫斯科外的最大城市，而該城之位置，距離芬蘭邊境僅三十一一公里之遙，換句話說，列甯格勒與外國邊境距離之短，現代大砲已可轟及，因此芬蘭對蘇聯態度，是否親善抑敵對，很爲重要。」爲此蘇聯向芬蘭要求的，是（一）將蘇芬在卡里利亞地崍的邊境，移至列甯格勒以北一百公里，而以蘇維埃</p>
<p>加里亞一部分補償芬蘭。（二）將芬蘭灣一小部分，在固定期內租與蘇聯，俾蘇聯在該處設立海軍根據地，以保證芬蘭灣之安全。（三）蘇聯以卡里利亞一部分交換芬蘭灣中之某島與里巴區，及史萊特尼半島。（四）芬蘭在阿倫脫島設防。不許有第三國參加。</p>
<p>對於以上條件，傳聞芬蘭允許其中第一項；蘇聯對此，自不能認爲滿意，而芬蘭認爲這種讓步是最大限度，無可再讓，雙方談判旣在這樣情形下停頓，則談判一時不易繼續，自屬意中事。以芬蘭對抗蘇聯、自非蘇聯之敵。芬蘭知道這一層，所以決不敢貿然訴諸武力，而蘇聯亦似乎沒有以暴力貫澈其擴展政策的決心。再就波羅的海各國的態度觀之，芬蘭的背後，雖有奧斯羅公約簽字的國家，如挪威瑞典丹麥的表示同情，美國羅斯福總統的遙作聲援，然而這都不過是一些口惠，對於蘇芬糾紛，並無必然的辦法。原來波羅的海上的重要國家，一爲蘇聯，另一自爲德國；德國在此戰時，當然惟有坐視蘇聯的擴展，德國已向芬蘭作勸告，謂芬蘭應努力對蘇聯商取妥協；如此勸告，除了見好蘇聯之外，亦無甚意義。最近數日，蘇聯報紙對芬蘭雖攻擊甚烈，可是兩國外交關係，迄未中斷，談判之門，仍然開着。這决蘇芬邊境雖然發生這樣的糾紛，可是此事或許不是蘇芬邦交破裂的朕兆，而是加速談判重開的機會。據哈瓦斯社昨日消息，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫在蘇芬邊境發生糾紛之後，雖以照會一件，交與芬蘭駐蘇公使斯基南，要求芬蘭立即將該國軍隊，自兩國邊界撒退二十五公里，可是蘇聯照會，並不是以哀的美敦書形式出之，「磋商途徑，依然洞啟。蘇聯用意，殆欲迫令芬蘭重開談判　「云云。果爾，則蘇芬糾紛，不過是局部事件，不久即可解決，而不致引起怎樣重大的糾紛。原來在此戰事期間，每一個國家皆成爲每一個火藥庫：芬蘭雖不如蘇聯强大，但其爆炸力量，亦爲蘇聯所並不漠視；故在蘇聯並無壓倒一切的把握之時，不致對芬蘭作何觸發爆炸的舉動。即如前天的邊界糾紛、情理上亦即不能論斷爲芬蘭意存挑釁；而蘇聯則大可以此爲催促芬蘭賡續談判的請柬！</p>
<h3>芬蘭炮轟蘇邊防軍　蘇聯提出嚴重抗議　認芬軍集中為敵對行為　要求撤退廿至廿五公里</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯人民外交委員長莫洛托夫廿六晚接見芬蘭公使葉柯基南、當將蘇聯政府關於卡萊里亞地峽方面芬蘭軍向蘇聯軍開砲事件之節略一件面交葉氏、葉氏接受節略後、稱渠將立即與本國政府接洽、俾早日提出復文、蘇方節略全文如下、「公使閣下、據紅軍參謀本部報吿、十一月廿六日下午三時四十五分、芬蘭境內突然開砲向駐紮卡萊里亞地峽曼尼拉村附近距蘇芬國界不遠地帶之蘇聯軍隊轟擊、開砲共計七發、結果蘇方死士兵三名、下級司令一名、傷士兵七名、司令二名、蘇方軍隊因會接奉嚴令不准接受挑釁、迄未加以回擊、蘇聯政府將上項事件通知閣下之際、認爲應請閣下注意敝政府近頃與貴國丹納及巴西基維兩君進行談判時、業已指出大批芬蘭正規軍集中列奪格拉附近國界之危險、今茲果爾發生由芬蘭境內砲轟蘇軍之挑釁事件、凖此蘇聯政府不得不聲明芬蘭軍隊之集中列寗格拉附近、不但爲對列寗格拉之威脅、抑且爲對於蘇聯之敵對行鑑爲、而即今已引起攻擊蘇軍、造成死傷之事實、蘇聯政府無意擴大芬軍此種可憎的攻擊行動、其發生原因、或係芬方官長之統率無方、惟蘇政府不願此類可憎行動今後續行發生、爲此、蘇政府爰對業已發生之一切事件、提出堅決抗議、並向芬蘭政府建議、將芬蘭軍隊立即由卡萊里亞地峽國界向後撤退二十至廿五公里、以免再度發生挑釁舉動、專此佈聞、即頌公祺、蘇聯人民外交委員長莫洛托夫、」（二十六日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>芬方否認　防軍發砲</h3>
<p>芬京　關於蘇聯方面所發芬蘇兩國邊務糾紛一項消息、官塲方面頃發表公報稱、「芬國邊防軍並未發砲、蘇聯邊防軍砲隊則曾舉行演習」云、此外蘇聯政府提出照會、要求芬國邊防軍撤退二十五公里之後、此間人心極爲震動、咸謂此層倘若照辦、芬國即須將維布利城方面要塞鞏護之區域、予以放棄、是烏乎可、好在蘇聯照會、尙非哀的美敦書、磋商途徑、依然洞啟、蘇聯用意、殆欲迫令芬蘭重開談判、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>滬杭車出軌　死傷甚眾</h3>

<p>廿五晨、由杭開滬之頭班火車、在莧橋臨平間因路軌被毀傾覆、業經日發言人昨晚在新聞報道席一予以承認、謂傾覆事係火車一列脫軌所致、並否認外傳華人乘客四五十人死傷之說、謂僅有乘客十人受輕傷、</p>

<p>上月發行　角幣總數</p>
<p>在上月中、中央銀行上海分行發出之一角二角新輔幣券、總共三百五十萬元之多、今時僅相隔數旬、竟有此種缺乏現象、殊出一般意料之外、至於分幣券首批發行爲五十萬元、本足敷市卜零找需要、今竟亦吿缺乏、亦爲意料所不及、</p>
<p>四行會同　設法補救</p>
<p>現中央銀行上海分行、已會同中國交通農民等行、設法予以補救、除先由中國農民銀行將庫存之五角輔券儘量發兌流通外、關於補救辦法、俟總行核准後、即公吿實行、</p>
<p>分幣劵到　滬再公告</p>
<p>至於農民銀行每日兌換發行五角輔幣劵、為數約十餘萬、因該行地址在霞飛路、行址並不寬暢、而兌換者人數擁擠、故自今日（廿八）起、移至亞爾培路四三九號中央銀行辦理兌換手續、時間為每日上午九時至十二時、二批分幣券已由美商永寗公司承印、俟印竣後由中央銀行上海分行公吿發行、所以輔幣券分幣券之缺乏恐慌、不久即可消除、</p>

<p>備就文告</p>
<p>如次、日軍佔據公共租界之蘇州河以北區域、繼對工部局當局在該區之行政管理、加以限制、致使該區之局方產業、多數不能目不値繼續辦理、日當局旣要求利用局方之數處產業、工部局乃許其</p>
<p>暫時佔用</p>
<p>但係向有關當局租賃者、故日方承認業主為工部局而償付足額之租金、且租賃者負有維持屋宇完整與納稅之責任、出租予日方者、大多爲蘇州河以北前充學校與醫院之屋宇、蓋工部局發覺此等學校與醫院、今已</p>
<p>難以經營</p>
<p>也、宰牲塲之出租、亦在考慮中、工部局前設蘇州干所、經局方之許可，今改成日方醫院、以照料人數大增之日僑、故日本居留民協會醫樂部、已遷入廢棄不用之海寗路工部局隔離醫院、蘇州河以北之工部局產業、</p>
<p>已有兩處</p>

<h3>青年病的理想療法</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞慟大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師著　　青年病以患手淫遺精滑精症最多　治療之法除攝生外應服對症良藥</p>
<p>青年有病，多歸罪於個人之不善調攝，或立足不穩，爲聲色所誘，陷入深淵，自取其咎，靑年因不知攝生之方，或受性慾之驅使，固爲其致病之源，然亦有其咎不在靑年自身，而由於父母所造成者，卽先天不足，先天殘缺，或遺傳等；疾患是也。</p>
<p>關於先天之原因甚多，如父母之身體不康健，或結婚過早，或有花柳等遺傳疾患，皆足以留遺其子女。及其子女至靑年發育期間，乃見發育不全，或性器官之殘缺，靑年之大患，爲手淫，爲遺精，其發生雖有種種誘因，亦與先天之質素有關，大的手淫遺精之人，多爲神經質，喜孤獨不合羣，故自樂其樂之手淫等惡習，皆跟此素因而發生。</p>
<p>手淫與遺精，有顯然之因果，卽犯手淫者，其後莫不息遺精，手淫之人其克制之力甚薄，性慾一起，必手淫而後快，精液旣洩，頹然入睡，此時睡夢必酣，加以精液吿乏，故無遺精發生，一旦發生遺精，始知病象已現，悔不當初，于此，摒絕手淫，改正其行爲者，屢見不少，此手淫與遺精因果之正面也。</p>
<p>遺精旣久，新陳代謝之機能在為障碍，腦部與臂部，均發生虛象，如耳鳴，頭痛，健忘，失眠，早洩，陰萎，腰痠背痛等症叢生，此時之治療辦法，最合於吾輩醫師之理想者，自以先戒絕手淫，淸心寡慾，勿飲過量之酒，匆食酸辣等刺激物，然後再投以德國遺精專藥「耐而斯遺精片」則有常夜止遺之功，不論任何凶惡之滑精，及頻繁之遺精症，三粒見效，一盒見功。惟因遺精過久，腦部虛損，腎部虛萎，早洩陰萎者，應兼以德國內分泌劑男用「補體康」治之，廿四小時卽生精補腎，健腦旺神，此在醫師臨床上久素設實者，其女用「補體康」有調經種子，治貧血不妊之功，凡乳部萎癟，發育不全，最爲對症。</p>

<h3>咳嗽與肺癆</h3>
<p>— 肺病專家盛在強</p>
<p>咳嗽與肺癆，似爲一種有連帶關係的病息，此言也，實含有至理之名言，大家要曉得是在肺臟里如果有一點兒外物侵進去，那牠就起了固有的反應，牠的反應現象，就是咳嗽，能使肺臟發生咳嗽的，有因物理的刺激，或因細菌破壞後的刺激而起。前者如因氣候的關係，受寒冷的氣壓所刺激，而發生咳嗽，後者如結核菌的破壞肺組織而致咳嗽。此所舉者，不過其大略而已。</p>
<p>現在已屆冬令，氣厭漸高　，寒風折骨，一般體弱而乏抵抗力的人們，很容易引起咳嗽的毛病；這種毛病，假如素無結核菌的人們，也因了咳嗽的刺激，而使肺臟原有抵抗力日形減弱，因而很容易招致結核菌的侵襲。假如人們素有結核菌的話，那末，咳嗽一病，更容易誘發結核菌活動之機會，因之發生肺病。由此觀之，吾人如一旦患有咳嗽，卽當趕速醫治，庶免他日釀成難於治愈之肺癆病，俗諺有云，「傷風不醒變成癆」，這話確有見地。</p>
<p>咳嗽之必須早治，已成爲必要之事實，現在所留下的問題，在於用何種療法，才能有效；這問題現已得到解決！蓋由余經騐，以服用德國肺病咳喇特效藥「補肺拿爾」功效最勝，患者，不論其爲初起之咳嗽、，或爲遠年之頑固咳嗽，服後能於三小時內，卽奏鎭咳止嗽平喘之功；並能促食慾之增進，如其咳嗽已久，並已成肺病者，那來服「補肺拿爾」，亦能迅速治愈之，這也是世界各國肺病專家一致承認之肺病特效藥也。</p>
<h3>兩性淋病</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>花柳病的患者，我們不必拿什麼「道德」兩個字眼去譴責他，我們是醫家，是解決人家痛苦的醫家，應該談談一些有效的切實療法，並切應該考察花柳病的社會上的原因。</p>
<p>爲速行撲滅此兩性將來不幸之慘劇起見，可服用德國淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，因此劑爲蛋白體黃色素混合製成，服後能使用細胞發生抗淋噬菌之偉大功效，故爲一般淋病患者所最賞用的。凡一切新老白濁，只要服用「克淋儂」後數小時，卽發生上述種種效力。將流散血液等處的淋菌，徹底掃蕩，再男子外用「抗淋水」女子外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，如此在急性淋時可三星期治愈，慢性時期在五星期，無不收根治之效。如已結婚夫婦同患淋病者，可同時治療，以免輾轉傳染，而收十全之效。此爲余多年來實地之經騐。</p>
<h3>發育不全的補救</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>有患者林雪年者，常州人，年二十一嵗，（自訴）——自小身欠佳，十七歲時，曾犯手淫，半年後卽知害戒絕，但因疾病常侵，故骨瘦如柴，日常時覺疲應，十九嵗時，乃有遺精發生，大都爲有夢遺精，約一星期一次，後漸决增加，一增而爲一星期兩次之多，因此，身體一日不如一日，曾往某醫師處診治，謂息有肺病，服魚肝油四瓶並藥數服，然亦無寸效，如今身體大不如前，身材短小，陰莖僅一寸有餘，自知己患發育不全，未知先生可有補救方法云云（治愈經過）——令其嚴守攝養，服「耐而斯遺精片」以止其遺洩，再兼以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，以培補虧損，使之重復發育，林君遵言而行，二星期後，遺精已無，再服二月，容顯豐潤，量食大增，重獲發育體重增加十五磅。</p>

<p>根治淋濁，應注意之點，厥爲病家擇醫求藥之是否精細謹愼，或草率從事，如其一犯淋毒，能治療得當，則所謂淋病元頑固不能根除者，實是欺人之語，惟是如果不依據科學的方法治療，或不守攝生，往往眞成爲難治之病，是不可不特別注意之點也。祇以淋病患者，多在初次遭過，又多無醫學常識，所以當其十分痛苦時，不免濫服市上一般富有副作用之成藥，以求暫時之鎭痛，豈知此等鎭痛之成藥，大多含有一種麻醉性之成分。讀者須知吾人之初染淋病，其痛苦之現象，乃一種生理上自然之反應，並非用麻醉之法可以奏功。而且麻醉之品，大多有减低病家原有之抵抗力，此其一也。又一病家爲受環境關係，對於平時工作，還是勉强支持，要知淋病之第一攝生條件，厥爲安靜，今乃反其道而行之，於病體豈無寗乎？故余歷年來治愈之淋病之較他人爲迅速者，病家除聽余治療外，幷受余指示之攝生方法也，至對於治療方法，在內服藥中，首推淋病聖劑「克淋儂」。因「克淋儂」之殺菌功效，能直達病灶，包圍淋菌而撰滅之。一方並用德國靜電療法，使淋菌之附緣前後尿道者，亦得靜電而無立足之地，故在急性淋時，因此等療法殺菌力之周密，無法漏網，迅速治療，而慢性淋之用此法，尤能根本解決，永不再發也。診時上午十時至下午六時每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角，並贈價値一元之「性病全書」一册</p>

<h3>上海　戰後二年人才供求的一瞥（九）</h3>
<p>— 潘文安鄭文漢沈光烈</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>綜合以上各點比較分析、對於上海人才供求實况、概括的可得下列幾點結論、</p>
<p>（一）求人機會與求職者人數比例、較戰前與戰後一年均見增高、約占十與八之比、惟成就職業的不及三分之一、與前相差無幾、失業的嚴重性、迄未减去、</p>
<p>（二）機會的種類和人才的能力兩相比較、前者以商業交通技術、與工藝人才最多、後者以商業敎育文事人才最多、其中供求不相應的頗多、因此成功的機會也减少、</p>
<p>（三）求職的人、男子約多女子四倍半、較前年度减少、惟較之戰前仍見高出、而男女求職者的比例、較與男女機會的比例略高、但這些微的差別、並不能顯示女子求職的較男子爲易、</p>
<p>（四）求職者希望獲得的報酬、較前年度更見低落、但用人方面所肯出的待遇、仍較求職者希望的爲低、現下上海物價如此飛漲、生活程度高出數倍、這種低微的報酬、能維持生活的恐爲數不多、對於職業的安定性和工作效能、均有影響、</p>
<p>（五）內地需求人才的機會日見增多、較前年度奚止增加十倍、其中以技術人才爲最多、待遇方面亦較上海爲高、懷有專門技能的求職者、如果肯耐勞苦、冒險犯難、以往內地較易得到適當的工作、</p>
<p>人才供求原是國家一個大問題、戰後至今已逾兩年、全國人才的統制與分配、還未有具體的辦法、殊屬可惜、本文所得人才供求不適應的結論、實顯示這問題的嚴重性依然存在、恐非限於上海一隅、全國人才應如何調查統計、應如何善爲調整、應如何分配利用、俾得人盡其才、爲國效勞、對於戰事的前途、實有其決定的因素、希望當局善爲妥籌從整個方面、求得問題的解決、此外、用人機關能從工作效能和生活程度來決定報酬、求職者能注重專門技能的獲得、和服務道德的修養、人才供求問題、當易得到解決、（完）</p>

<h3>證券　內債一度上漲　外股多頭出籠　洋商派息多起</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况變動頗速、初因南北謠言朋興、此則直接間接與公債以甚大的打擊、故行市初則劇跌頗甚、午後忽傳宋氏再長財政、市債驟漲一元、入後因消息不確、遽爾回跌半元、其實人事問題、證之往事、與公債何涉、昨日經過、上午初間松茂首先賣出、久孚聯和同康等相繼出脫、雖潤利益昌大豐聯益或補空、或加碼、市價毫無起色、午後略同小五角、午後因宋氏上台謠言、多方利用之抬價、空方乃遽爲所惑、紛粉抵補、以散戶買進爲最熱鬧、茂泰豐泰亦均買進、同康聯和樂茂則出多進少、中孚三開恒康同順則逢高賣出、乃得善價、趨勢高而復低、結果略好二三角、但收盤後市價又小、成交總數共計約一百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交寗紹輪船公司股三十股、價爲八元正、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、開盤甚堅、後因匯市又緊、獲利多頭、紛起出籠、市况急遽回落、一如過去所爲、邇來最被愛戴各股、此際所受影響亦最鉅、收盤時買戶尙不乏人、惟價格則較前日過低、</p>
<p>本埠匯通洋行經理之英楂華橡皮公司、昨經董事會議决、定於十二月七日開派一九三九年份第二次中期股息、每股國幣七角五分、（編者按第一次中期股息已派七角五分、兩共已派國幣一元五角）、</p>

<h3>紗花　同行搶購　本棉跳六七元　外棉反趨沉寂</h3>
<p>本棉交易、問行互做買賣異常踴躍、此因匯票轉縮之後、外棉訂價高昂、而蘇北來源旺擋已過、且內地鄉裏秤價亦復提高、所以有一部份投機者、囤藏棉紗、不如收囤棉花、較爲利厚、廠方雖無躉批消費、然同行鑒前者情形、搶先搜羅不絕、故市價一跳六七元之譜、通州花價已到一百四十八元、廠方新生廠進南太倉五百包、尙係送到廠門交易、不包烘水、可想市面之俏俐一般、日商上海廠稍有需要、蘇北來源、到通花一千五百〇七包、北河來八百九十五包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初因海外來電俱吿下落、因之市况殊見疲乏、投機者乘機拋賣、後現貨商及海外棉商俱在市賣出、多頭紛紛獲利了結、收盤價格、較之上日跌落十餘磅音、印度連同預測跌落八羅比、埃及漲二十餘磅音、利物浦十便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來又趨靜寂、華廠方面前次乘價廉時、仍稍事購買、是項原棉業已裝運在途、將於下月陸續到埠、故暫時無缺貨之虞、故購意異常淡薄、同業對於原棉之採購、亦殊淡薄、日方亦殊靜寂、茲將昨日美棉市値以美匯七元八七五抑合送廠價如下、</p>

<h3>港幣漲價　棉紗港銷　又見活絡</h3>
<p>紗市續趨前進、漲風再熾、此因外匯黑市改縮、以致人心挺拔、一般投機者心思轉高、在市紛紛搜羅、於是棉面略形堅佾、同時原棉受匯兌影響、外棉核算價較昂、市盤愈見膨脹、至於實銷、雖無大量發展、然港帮漲價、該帮採辦貨物比較劃算、所以零星生意、較曩昔比較活絡一些、二十支雙馬收盤價爲六六七一八元云、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人心一致向榮、因消息良好、且外滙續硬、掀起買風、開價爲六百七十三元、後則逐步上騰、霎間到六百八十一元、少頃某豐分頭吐出、忽挫落九元、又到六百七十二元、旋以傳說棉價大跳、而滙票再縮、又復上進、查半日間成交統計一千九百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲十四元、雙地球漲十三元、天女漲十元、崇信廠開出二十支大發二百二十五包、價爲六百五十五元、茲將各帮口買去之額今分列如左、</p>

<h3>雜糧　黃豆暴漲一元</h3>
<p>雜糧市塲一因油價逐步飛騰、人心不無牽制、二爲外滙在緊、金價邁步上升、致助長囤戶之胃口、黃豆首先騰躍、自星期日開始騷動、至昨日祗在二日之閒、暴漲一元有奇、計開南京豆三百包、價爲十四元至十四元三角、蕪湖豆二百包、價爲十四元三四角、安慶豆一百三十包、價爲十四元五角、了家州豆二百六十包、價爲十五元、崇明沙黃四百餘包、價爲十五元二角至十四元六角半、浦東杜豆六十包、價爲十五元四角、其他各籽行動一致、大都比上週六拉提三四角不等、</p>

<h3>煤炭　開平煤銷路突盛</h3>
<p>烟煤生意，近來因水汀開放、銷路突盛、市塲每日成交達于餘噸、尤以中等貨居多、同業拆價、計做開平一號塊每噸八十二元、開平二號塊七十四元、頭號屑七十元，二號屑六十二元、基隆屑五十八元、同業棧房出貨、送到客戶酌加行槓、</p>
<h3>糧食　果有餓鄉記好漢決心　米糧決不會被操縱　真個要平準糧價不使操縱　只有在到源暢旺管理有方</h3>
<p>粳米自前午一度轉疲、昨又遭投機家操縱、再見回昂般囤戶，爲保持手中貴貨、不使虧耗、不惜再出高價搜羅、致造成客販良好之機會、繼續抬價、而本鄉店胃、見市面不易回軟、心思亦好、內地帮見本銷活動、相繼採辦、形勢隨即轟動、在各價步步喊高之中、好在到源絡繹、昨又到蘇同帮十六車、及靑泗崑太楓嘉等貨二十餘車、及由白茆口運來常宜路一帶之貨二千餘包、到頭一旺、操縱者自無能爲力、然結果若薄稻價以身骨較弱、不易久守、仍屬定局、粳尖行情仍增六七角及半元左右、統市成交數七八千包、</p>
<p>客秈昨晨又被舖作暢辦、而囤胃愈見活躍、故開價立見上騰六七角以上、旅以香港洋米源源抵申、而江北秈等亦有輪運整批到埠、併計的有五千包左右、今明即可轉棧出樣、故後市人心回定、價亦微抑、高客秈三十三元半、仍較昂四五角云、</p>
<p>洋米因匯水不定、定貨絕望、昨以金漲囤貪、市氣尤形活潑、安南粳三十四元半、西貢三十四元至三十三元、比之前市回好半元許、昨日還羅來米二萬〇六百五十八包、</p>
<p>米價當出新時、狂抬猛漲、且有一日之間漲四五元、即專以投機市塲買空賣空如證劵紗花市塲亦應在停板之列、可是米糧尙多實物買賣、需要大宗資力、方可操縱、不如交易所只追證了事、故其魄力確較其他投機爲大、然亦無論何人、莫不深惡痛絕其行爲、但米糧所以爲人操縱、亦無非利用來貨受制、（此受制原因不止一端）供求不易平衡、及資力上接濟有路之故、以言制止米商操縱辦法、有政治的、有經濟的、尙有消極的應付、即如米商操縱、大衆消費者能直接聯合向產米區貿米、不但米商無生意可做、即販戶亦將不禁而自絕、操縱史無從談起、不過從何聯合起來、去採辦、去分發、用以合盯洋米、尙多困難、何况如此複雜之事、假使委託變相商人去辦、能保其遂漸不發生如前之弊　、至於阻撓出運、種種留難、以及苛捐雜稅、凡屬有血氣之倫、無不切齒、能得打消、亦無有不願望、尙有一種抵制辦法、即無論那一方面、凡與民食以打擊者、即實施杯葛行動、不去買食、或改食洋米、或改食粉麥、粉麥如亦被操縱、寗吃洋粉麥、洋米粉麥如一時不易　得、寗可枵腹、枵腹之極、寗可與『餓鄉記』諸位好漢抱同樣的決心、使糧商手中之貨、無人理會、被操縱之技倆、不窮目窮、並使外國通訊社以後不再將徒亂人意爲糧商增加操縱機會之消息傳至中國、或竟設法施以封鎖、在日本去年關冊內據聞無米糧進口（？）、在今年旣有輸入外米之說、但望其非事實即使事實、經此「廢米日」運動之後、或者使今年或明年之日本關册內可無外米進口記載、即有外米進口、要須來自西貢蘭　等地、如此、眞是中國民食之幸福、又不要如前數年米糧只管向烟靑津各地運去、究竟是不是就地消費、到今是一個疑問、此外要希望米價平落、只有到頭暢旺、供求相稱、或供過於求、或管理有方、或調節有度、在各方情形兼　並顧之下、覓一種比較可行的辦法、</p>
<h3>現粉廠盤開　七元五角現鈔　福新將停車開放</h3>
<p>麵紛　昨爲週初開市之期、現粉廠盤又加一角、改爲七元五角現鈔、蓋緣近來南北洋帮客銷、均告活潑、即本街零批交易、亦以米價高貴、平民搭食麵粉者甚多、故需要較增、惟各廠均以目下原料價昂、成本高大、對於大帮去化、悉加限制、聞福新廠已將一部份停車開放、以俾增加生產而資供應、昨日成交不多、全市約計四五萬包、車船牌回籠貨及客盤均較廠盤暗升五分至角許、但無正式市面、</p>
<p>小麥　來源到六七千包、</p>
<p>在粉市提漲聲中、執貨者、致堅昂、不願輕脫、廠方亦不肯放價吸收、囤戶亦少垂靑、市面復小麥二車價爲十一元八角、福阜兩廠、均告停辦、</p>

<h3>文藝與人生</h3>
<p>— 聞歌</p>
<p>瞎子摸到了象尾巴，就說象比老鼠還小。這是以部分決定全體，自然是錯誤的。人生觀也如此，它雖然十抽象的東西，但也有部分和全體的區別。真實的人生觀：不能以部分決定全體，而應該以全體決定部分。可是部分雖然統一於全體，却也有對立的。如果忽略了它的對立，而誇大了它的統一，那瞎子把尾巴決定為象的故事，就是例證。</p>
<p>不少人說，文藝作品是以反映眞實人生爲宗旨，這是鐵的事實。我們可以來提鍊人生，來擴大世界觀。只是這裏要注意部分和全體的關係；若不注意，那必會曲解了人生觀，使部分過於擴張，却使全體模糊。</p>
<p>譬如以安特列夫來說，對於人生的醜惡面，他看到是很多的。所以他的作品中，只有對於人生表示絕望的哀吟。其實人生雖說有廣闊的黑暗面，但並不是全然如此，另外還有光明面對立著呢。</p>
<p>至於另一悲觀作家契可夫，則和他稍稍不同。他是一個深切了解人類的性質和弱點的人，因此對於人生也表示無可如何的悲哀，不過他不像安特列夫那樣的完全絕望，他在陰　裏，還希望著遼遠的將來會好一點。只是他這種希望，疑問的氣息太濃重，所以眞正的光明還和他有相當的距離。</p>
<p>籠統地說來，這兩個作家所看到的人生和世界，不能算錯。可惜他們太膠著於部分，以致對於全體，像霧中看花似的，看不眞切，結論當然成爲問題了。</p>
<p>其實宇宙間永遠不變的東西是沒有的，黑暗和光明也一樣。如其對於人生不表示絕望，則周圍雖然全都黑暗，也不必畏懼或怎樣，只要你能努力不懈的跟它奮鬥，光明總有到來的一天。誠然有時難免犧牲在激烈的戰鬥中，但能够給予後來者以便利，也是好的。所以對於契可夫和安特列夫，我總覺得無限的惋惜。</p>
<p>在這里，使我想到了高爾基，他是和他們逈然不同的，他了解世界有黑暗的一面。但他並不表示悲觀；相反的他更以堅毅的力量來找出黑暗的　結，而予以打破。他曾說：「我們不能不生存於這生活之中；我們必須認清牠；我們必須改造牠。」這是多麽正確的話，是鋒利地刺進悲觀者的心胸！</p>
<p>文藝作品影響於人們的思想是很大的。當然所呈現的世界觀，也要非常正確。否則，勢必有不少意志薄弱的人會受到迷惑，從而演出慘痛的悲劇，這又何苦呢？所以每個作家，我以爲應該客觀的整個的指出世界觀。</p>
<h3>莎莉</h3>
<p>— 徐野</p>
<p>伏爾加河的流水日夜不斷地奔流漪，這水的源頭在瓦爾戴連岡。河畔朝夕有着雄歌的船夫。這條曾經千萬隻鐵掌以鮮血完成的自由之港，給它的名字是：偉大的俄羅斯的血河。</p>
<p>冬天，河的水聲更是憤怒地激盪了。迷眼的雪花又平舖在沙原上，不遠地可以聽到牧羊女和羊羣的呼吸的聲音，淸趣呵，展開在河的四圍。</p>
<p>掠擊波面上的水鳥，它們成羣地向村落中的風塔翱翔去，雪後的原野蕃籃花吐露它一陣沁人的香馥，十月的陽光緊吻着廣大的山　河堤，綠色的雲霞下河更伸長着紅色的浪濤，雄壯的濤聲値得生長在自由國度裏的男女所愛好和謳歌啊……</p>
<p>這裏，我遇見了莎莉，她管着十隻羊羣，然而，她愛伏爾加河咆哮的巨浪，每天她總是趕了羊　來的。</p>
<p>『早安！』</p>
<p>莎莉是一個果敢的孩子。</p>
<p>『再吿訴我的伏爾加河的故事吧！』</p>
<p>斜陽連結着一綫鮮明的霞光，動物的足音從松林裏吹透上來，行旅者的倒影反映在河面的急流上，黃昏時的牧塲慢慢地靜寂下去，那寒流失却了往日的態度，夜的到來異外地感到陰森森的。</p>
<p>『你願意呼吸着靜夜的風嗎？』</p>
<p>我深切地注視她，莎莉瞻望雲層裏的羽影笑了。</p>
<p>離開了河畔，她的步伐顧得非常的緩慢，羊羣伴着這沙原中的旅人，莎莉底琥珀似的眼睛仍然瞪視一片渺茫的星野</p>
<p>『是過去的事吧：我們的祖宗的血灑遍了這條河，有那樣驚人的日子：鐵牢下的受難者開始壯烈的行動，為者我們要自由和陽光！』</p>
<p>莎莉說着，而且唱着：「我愛祖國的太陽，炫目的光輝呀！我們永遠地高歌在明朗的大地上，以結實的氣力建築着光明的城堡……」</p>
<p>我異常地受着激動。</p>
<p>「我希望目己能够有流血的一天！」</p>
<p>她笑了，對我拍着掌。</p>
<p>夜天，在月光之下莎莉吆喝羊羣去了，原野的凉氣很濃厚的，我遙望村落中的幾點燈火……</p>
<p>「我們明日見！」響亮的聲音在高空中　　着。</p>
<p>血潮湧着胸府，在迷模的摸案中我清醒了：　視着前途，沉默的　念如今添增着更大的勇力，雖然沒有一支蘆笛來和着莎莉的壯歌。為了她，我將用戰鬥去回答祖國的號召！</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>黎明，莎莉又來了。</p>
<p>「你惦記着：沙原中會開出鮮紅的奇葩，不久我給你一隻芒鞋，那裏有我流過的血漬！」</p>
<p>抬頭間蒼鷹爭逐着　　的白雲，伏爾加河再度澎湃起潮肅……</p>
<p>哦！我就有無盡的生命的泉源了啊！</p>
<h3>「信美非吾土」</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>這幾天來，每天早晨，在街上常能看見花匠，担着各色各樣的菊花。於是時髦的廳室裏，便常有菊花的點綴。</p>
<p>但我對這些菊花，常有二種冥想：菊花站在堂皇的廳室裏，不會更美麗一些。</p>
<p>果然我的冥想並不會錯。有一天，我到某酒樓去吃親戚的喜酒，禮堂中佈置得十分華麗，客人們都喜氣溢洋。大家興高彩烈，簡直要鬧到夜深方散。這禮堂裏也有幾盆菊花，可是都垂頭喪氣似的，大不如我早上在花担中所看見的鮮艷，葉是乾枯了，花是捲縮了。人們即到夜半，我看精神還是個個煥發，猜拳哪喝酒哪，擠着看新娘哪，大談生意發財經哪，還是一個也沒有些憔悴模樣。那末菊花爲甚會如此呢？牠原是站在盆裏的，盆裏有土，雖然少些，也不至不‘足供牠一日的所需罷！不錯，我想菊花站在堂皇的禮堂裏，不會更美麗一些。</p>
<p>有了這一次的經騐，我以後每次經過酒樓一類門前時，我就再注意牠們門前所放的翠柏之類，那確是經常青翠得令人可愛。我對門的一家露臺上，也常放着幾盆雜花，確也沒有看見過枯萎憔悴的模樣，雖然有時遇着狂風暴雨，花葉也許零落一些，花枝却仍是挺然卓立，毫無頹喪氣象。</p>
<p>菊花原是以傲霜出名的，蘇東坡所謂「荷盡已無擎雨蓋，菊殘猶有傲霜枝。」雖然被寒霜壓着，牠還是開着艷花。牠根本不要舒適，牠要與環境奮鬥，所以牠不想趁春夏之際，和衆花比艷，牠一定要在衆姊妹已經歛聲消跡之後，苒吐出牠獨有的秀姿。牠的孤傲固然令人佩服，牠的不畏壓迫，獨力奮鬥，更可使人無限崇敬。因爲牠的生性如此，所以什麽舒適堂皇的廳室，在牠是反覺可憎的。</p>
<p>倘使菊花眞像人們一樣，我想，牠一定會宣佈人們的罪過，牠更會喊着「信美非吾土，」而離開了廳室，仍去和暴風雨艱苦地奮鬥。</p>
<h3>「塞上曲」之輯（書評）</h3>
<p>— 若虹</p>
<p>音樂有着偉大感人的力量，一曲柔情悅耳的歌，會引起了無限的遐思；一闕雄壯激昂的曲子，會使熱血沸騰。抗戰以後，更證實了音樂歌唱不只是操縱了個人的情感，而且把握着整偭民族的靈魂，它的力量不河泯沒，萬千的歌詠團體雨後春筍般蓬勃地組織起來，就在於此。在後方利用唱歌聯絡純樸的民衆；教育無知的民衆。收穫了宣傳的效果也提高了智識的水準。在前綫，多少同志是受了歌唱的激動而增强了勇氣。在此時我國的音樂踏入一個新的階級，它對抗戰盡了最大的力量，它鼓舞了不少民情士氣，它也紀錄了不少可歌可泣的史蹟。</p>
<p>上海有個時期是與奮極了。各電台裏幾乎每一擋節目都播送着救亡歌曲，每一個角隅都蕩漾着令人興奮的歌聲。但，大軍西撤，因爲環境的特殊，一切都歸沉寂。聽到的全是早年查禁的「亡國之音」。自此，稍有意義的曲子便不多見。</p>
<p>偶然在一間小書舖裏，獲得了一本小冊子，那是靑年作曲家老忻近著的「塞上曲」。薄薄的只有二十四頁，包含了二十三首新歌，分作了四部份。歌詞隱射有力，但並不因爲淺顯而减削詞曲的含蓄。歌曲都很容易唱，尤其是「小蚊蟲之輯」裏的幾首，更是合乎初中及小學生的歌唱材料。曲譜全用樂觀欣快堅決熱情的調子，充滿了對抗戰勝利的信心。「我們有共同的理想，我們有共同的信仰，向共同的目標前進，意志像鋼鐵一樣。」這是册千裏畢業歌的詞句，愛好歌詠的大衆，看了以爲怎樣？</p>
<h3>向生篇</h3>
<p>— 翔</p>
<p>別怕命運迎頭搗鬼，儘管揩乾了頹唐的淚水；像鐵塊，偶然銹損的外形，遮不住骨子裏的堅硬。</p>
<p>不管舌痛壓得多麼緊，喘口氣，捏牢拳，咬定牙根，每個希望都要自己安排，衝破擠滿人間的迫害。</p>
<p>過去有一段朽爛的時間，活人何必抱着骸骨迷戀。眼前擺着個保證的未來，一脚踏進殘破的現在。</p>
<p>也許也慷憬未死的戀情，—這年頭誰敢替你保證？世界原有個明艷的花苞，可惜她昨天已被摧殘了。</p>
<p>生活便是時代的融爐，融爐內不容你半點踟躕；一陣煮熬—一片火光，銹鐵堆中煉出了鈍鋼。</p>

<h3>崑劇倡善懲惡　—有益世道人心—</h3>
<p>— 施以仁</p>
<p>聲音之道，感人最深，遷流轉徙，於世運之隆替，無不有關。明季梁伯龍·魏良輔·張小泉·季敬坡輩，能諧聲，轉音若游絲，剏爲崑腔。其時紅梨記，燕子箋盛行於舊京。至淸初騷人墨客，競撰傳奇，兼編劇本。一捧雪·千鐘祿·鐵冠圖等，宣揚忠正，浩氣冲霄；而翡翠園·漁家樂·一文錢·艷雲亭諸本，皆寓勸善之意，可使民情敦厚。至乾隆中葉，市井里巷，無不有度曲者；馴至今日，士氣衰靡，蒿蓬滿目，忠正道義，蕩然無存；法曲摧殘，正氣消失，伶人新編戲劇，都注重閨闈弄情，或眩奇鬥巧，襯以佈景，更不計時代之於景物，能相合拍否，觀劇者鮮有判斷力，歌扇旗亭，娛情悅目於一時耳。然而社會頹落，人情風俗，日益澆漓，欲求其正筴矩範，安可得哉。</p>
<p>水滸記借茶活捉，寫張三郞誘惑婦人以至同歸於盡；琴挑愉詩，原屬書生客居無伴，一遇妙尼，如磁引針，然而不忘功名，卒至成就歸來，乃結合爲夫婦。與西廂異曲同工；羅夢，勸人不必貪財；痴夢逼休，規戒婦人貞潔耐守，切勿朝秦暮楚。白羅杉乃述盜匪惡報，良妻義夫，孝子自有團聚之日。其餘如琵琶記之賢婦雙合，荊釵記之孝養綠厚，皆於觀者心地，有莫大感動，故予謂人心若能趨向崑劇，耶棄浮華，而蹈正途，世運可享隆盛。昔者編戲製由，煞費苦心，幾度校正，而後可以行世，有爲而作，比比然也。即錢塘洪昇所作長生殿傳奇，歷十餘年工夫，三易稿而成書，宜其可以流傳後世，滬上淫靡之風，盛極一時，大雅君子，當有所匡正，何能舍本而逐末哉。</p>
<h3>好萊塢影訊</h3>
<p>— 方穆</p>
<p>洛麗泰揚和大衛尼文是要好不過的朋友，他們底交誼已遠在五年以上了。她帮助他從事於開麥拉事業，彼此可說是志同道合旅鼓相當，現在他們合作領銜的一張片子呌“Eternally　Yours”內採取了皆大歡喜的題材，其中充滿着光明和愉快。他倆底優越性都給發揮無餘了。</p>
<p>誰也不敢說好萊塢的導演們和劇作者們不是一機會主義者」。“The　Housekeeper’s　Dauter”一片拍攝的時候，就鬧了一個有趣的笑話。原來：這裏面有一個實地拍攝的在紐約街上兇毆縱火的鏡頭，塲面是逼眞的，够熱鬧的。但因此就有人去打電話報吿警察當局說街上出亂子了，給鬧翻了！常局得報，果然派了大批警察海軍救火車，浩浩蕩蕩殺奔出事地點而來。結果這塲面給弄得更緊張了，却一一給製片者拍攝進去。自然不必再來個N，G，冒險的當事者竟因此有着很好的收獲。</p>
<p>這一次歐洲大戰爆發以來，歐洲的人民非常苦悶，需要一些安慰和刺激！在英法兩國的游藝界裏，自然，一般對於悲劇的演出是不會歡迎的，普遍地來代替的那是怪輕鬆的喜劇，這些，會給觀衆們帶來了笑容，暫時忘懷了煩愁。</p>
<p>關於電影，美國藝聯公司就送去了四種適宜的影片，以供同好。那四種是：一·李思廉霍華領銜的“Intermezzs”二·洛麗泰揚的“Eternally　Yours”三·瓊蓓耐脫的“The　Housekeeper’s　Danghter”四·勞萊哈台的“A　Chump　at　Oxford”。</p>
<h3>王先生與三房客之一幕</h3>
<p>（華新公司出品　新光映）</p>
<p>新作介紹</p>
<h3>玩偶夫人“The　Toy　Wife”</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>露薏絲蕾納的演技，從「歌舞大王齊格菲」起，任何一部作品都是獲得至高的褒獎的，她深刻的內心表演，好萊塢似乎還沒有一個可以和她並駕的女演員。「玩偶夫人」中的露薏絲蕾納，是演一個任性，好動，甚至把婚姻也視為兒戲的少女。從她父親偕同她們姊妹歸紐奧倫絲的農園起，邂逅姊姊露恙絲的兒時情侶喬治；和安杜利交遊；結婚後的嵗月；嫉妬露薏絲的把持家政；與安杜利情奔；最後病臥逆旅，臨終懇動露薏絲嫁給喬治，並扶養她的愛子，露薏絲蕾納充份地雕塑了劇作者所擬想的一位「玩偶夫人」。</p>
<p>導演蘇比，也傾其全力爲露薏絲蕾納作彫塑的輔助工作，所以在他細膩而動人的畫上，我們祇感得有許多塲面的不夠充份發展，而不是冗畏之弊。如吉爾拔和喬治的戀愛過程；和安杜利情奔後潦倒等戲，都不能充份的描寫，因此整個以下的幾個例子，都見導演者精細之處。（一）露薏絲從樓梯下來，見喬治從老父房里出來，她剛想回身，喬治呌住了她，但是喬治吿訴她的是他愛吉爾拔。露薏絲向他們祝頌後，他們接吻的時候，一個劃鏡頭安杜利剛在門口看到這黯然神傷的一幕。（二）喬治和安杜利決鬥，導演者祇寫吉爾拔從馬車上下來，聽見碰碰的兩響，她掩面而泣。（三）露薏絲拂喬奇到逆旅去見吉爾拔，喬治在下面等着，然而終於移步上樓。其他描寫姊妹之情，也很可愛。</p>
<p>茂文陶格拉斯的喬治，在目睹妻子放任不顧家政，而請露薏絲來家主持，他不忍責愛妻而又感露薏絲之恩的痛苦，非常感人。白蓓蘭奧妮兒的露薏絲犧牲自己的幸福而處處為妹妹着想，演來也很動人。</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Surround Japanese Forces Near Nanning; Mobile Units Intercept Japanese Supplies; Huang Xuchu Reports Guangxi Province Has Mobilized Popular Armed Forces; Military Situation Confidently Allows for a Major Strike Against the Japanese; War Spreads to Yujiang River Basin</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to recent news received here, Nanning has been heavily bombed by Japanese planes and artillery, and a major fire broke out today. The telegraph lines between Nanning and Liuzhou have been damaged, and telegraphic communications have been cut off. Chinese troops are currently surrounding the Japanese forces in Nanning, while Chinese mobile units have deployed positions along the highway in the mountains between Beihai and Nanning, with the aim of preventing supplies and Japanese reinforcements from reaching Nanning and resupplying the Japanese forces there. A military dispatch from Guangxi states that the commander-in-chief of the Chinese forces in the Guangxi region is personally directing the strategy to surround the Japanese forces between Nanning and the Yujiang River, and has now arrived in Nanning. The Guangxi Provincial Assembly has issued a proclamation calling on the Chinese people and military mobile warfare to cooperate, with the following slogans: "Guangxi's rice shall not fill the enemy's hunger, Guangxi's water shall not quench the enemy's thirst, Guangxi's houses shall not shelter the enemy, Guangxi's roads shall not serve the enemy." The proclamation states that the current campaign will test the veracity of General Chen Cheng's statement, that is, what General Chen Cheng said when describing the previous battle north of Xiang, that the power of Chinese farmers has defeated Japanese tanks, meaning that Chinese farmers have destroyed highways and roads, preventing the Japanese army from using its tanks. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Guilin: Merchants who escaped from Qinzhou said that the Japanese troops who landed in Qinzhou consisted of one division, and those who landed in Fangcheng consisted of one brigade, of which more than 1,000 are now stationed in Xiaodong. The Japanese troops in Qinzhou and Fangcheng are currently coercing civilians to build military roads. (Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Guilin: At 6:00 AM on the 24th, several hundred Japanese troops east of Qinxian at Pingyin Market crossed the Pingyin River to launch an attack. Chinese troops are intercepting them. (Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Guilin: Huang Xuchu reported at the provincial government's weekly memorial meeting on the 27th that the Japanese invasion of Nanning was originally within our expectations. Recently, due to the disastrous defeat north of Xiang, anti-war sentiment within the country is strong. At the same time, due to the outbreak of the European war, diplomacy is in a state of isolation. In order to suppress domestic anti-war sentiment and shift its diplomatic situation, it did not hesitate to risk invading Guangxi, attempting to cut off our southwestern transportation routes and reduce our determination to resist Japan. However, since the Japanese invaded Nanning, our determination to resist Japan has never changed because of it. At present, in addition to the regular troops in this province, the armed forces of the people in the adjacent war zones and within the war zones have been actively mobilized. The civil defense forces in various districts are also exerting their strength. Although Japan has entered Guangxi, I firmly believe that we have a military certainty to give them a major blow. As for the provincial administration, what should be paid attention to at this time, in terms of civil affairs, the county magistrates and township chiefs of each county should earnestly take responsibility and abide by the central government's instructions. If the county seat is lost, the county government should continue to exercise its functions as usual and must not leave the territory. At the same time, it should be directly implemented down to the township, village, and street heads, and must not panic or leave the territory before the Japanese arrive. In addition, attention should be paid to the security and food supply adjustments in districts and counties near the war zone and with special circumstances. The people who have not been evacuated should also be evacuated as much as possible. Those who have been evacuated, such as the elderly, weak, women, and children, should be actively provided with relief. We should also consult with the Pacification Commissioner's Office to dispatch training classes, and the trainees should go deep into the towns and villages to assist the town and village chiefs, so as to obtain more military guidance. In terms of finance, we should stabilize the province's finances, aiming to meet military needs. In terms of education, educational work at all levels in various places near the war zone should also strive to publicize. Those who have become war zones should also have urgent and appropriate measures. In terms of construction, the construction of new roads and the investigation and addition of communication networks should be accelerated to maintain transportation. If the above items can be fully achieved, military convenience can be obtained, and the progress of victory can be accelerated. (Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Guilin: The war in the Southern Route has spread to the Yujiang River basin. People here are generally optimistic about the future of the war situation, believing that the Japanese are venturing deep into the country alone, which is tantamount to giving China another opportunity to rebuild its special achievements. The gains and losses of a certain point cannot really determine the success or failure of the overall situation. Between the coast of Qinzhou Bay and the south bank of the Yujiang River, the Chinese army has inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese, and the severity of the blows that the Japanese will encounter in the future will be a hundred or a thousand times greater than in the past. At present, the area occupied by the Japanese is like a narrow corridor, with the undulating hills of the Shiwan Mountains, and the Yujiang River traversing one end of it. Within these hundred-odd kilometers, there are no human resources or materials. The Japanese army in this situation is a major disadvantage in combat. (Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Tentatively Retains All Ministers; Soong Tzu-wen Denies Taking Over as Finance Minister; It is Reported the Executive Yuan Will Add Three Ministries</h3>
<p>Chongqing: At this Sixth Plenary Session, in order to strengthen the connection between the military and political affairs and improve administrative efficiency, President Kong of the Executive Yuan repeatedly and firmly resigned, requesting the President to resume the post of President of the Executive Yuan. After the plenary session passed the resolution, all ministers and secretaries-general and political affairs directors of the Executive Yuan also resigned accordingly. After President Kong submitted it on their behalf, yesterday the Chairman approved it, tentatively retaining them all and ordering them to continue to perform their duties as usual. (Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Regarding the rumors in Hong Kong that Soong Tzu-wen would replace Kong Xiangxi as Minister of Finance, Chinese sources here claim that Kong is "very likely to retain his original position." However, they believe that this matter will be decided within two or three days. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reliable sources here, Soong Tzu-wen will replace Kong Xiangxi as Minister of Finance. However, official circles say that this matter is not yet certain, but it is very likely that Soong Tzu-wen will become the Minister of Finance. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: It is rumored that Dr. Kong Xiangxi has submitted his resignation as Minister of Finance and other positions, but it is generally expected that he will continue to serve as Minister of Finance. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Executive Yuan issued a public announcement today, briefly stating that during the Sixth Plenary Session, President Kong submitted his resignation to the Sixth Plenary Session in order to strengthen the unification of the central government for political and military affairs and improve the administrative efficiency of various departments, and requested the Plenary Session to elect Chairman Chiang to resume the position of President of the Executive Yuan. The Congress unanimously passed this resolution. Since Dr. Kong resigned as President of the Executive Yuan, all ministers and other officials unanimously submitted their resignations. Today, Chairman Chiang ordered all ministers and other officials of the Executive Yuan to unanimously withdraw their resignations and continue to work as usual. Judging from this, the rumors of Soong Tzu-wen resuming the position of Minister of Finance have been refuted by the facts. In addition to all the other ministers retaining their positions, the Executive Yuan has established three new ministries, the most important of which is the Ministry of International Trade, for which Zhu Ziwen's voice is very high. The other two ministries are the Ministry of Conservation and the Ministry of Social Affairs, and it is difficult to find out the candidates. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops Mutiny Near Changtaiguan</h3>
<p>Nanyang: The puppet troops stationed in Yangdian (southwest of Changtaiguan) mutinied completely on the 25th and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese Fujiwara Detachment. After four hours of fighting, both sides suffered heavy casualties. More than 1,000 Japanese troops in Changtaiguan went to Chenjiadian (west of Changtaiguan) in an attempt to encircle them. The sound of artillery fire was deafening and did not stop until late at night. (Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese troops on the Xinxiang-Suixian line have recently increased slightly. There are more than 1,000 Japanese troops in the Changtaiguan area. On the 25th, they moved northwest and engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army for nine hours. After more than a hundred casualties, they retreated to their original location. (Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3>The Soviet-Finnish Border Dispute</h3>
<p>The Soviet-Finnish negotiations have been going on for a long time. Although special envoys have traveled back and forth several times for consultations, no agreement has been reached due to the large disparity between the conditions of both parties. The Finnish authorities have announced that they are still willing to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union, but it has been two weeks since the Finnish representative returned home, and there is still no sign of the resumption of negotiations between the two parties. Until the day before yesterday, another border conflict occurred. According to TASS news, this disturbance was "caused by Finnish troops suddenly opening fire on the Soviet defense forces stationed in the village of Mainila in the Karelian Isthmus, firing a total of seven shots, resulting in the death of one Soviet Red Army soldier and one junior commander, and the injury of seven soldiers, one junior commander, and one second lieutenant." The Finnish side claimed that the Soviet army was conducting exercises and that there were no disputes between the two sides. Regarding this matter, the Soviet Union has sent people to investigate and ordered the border guards not to retaliate. Judging from the incident itself, it may only be a misunderstanding, and the incident will not escalate! However, as long as the Soviet-Finnish negotiations cannot reach a compromise, there is a possibility of disputes between the Soviet Union and Finland. The Soviet Union must implement its control over the Gulf of Finland, so that the large city of Leningrad, which protrudes into the Baltic Sea, and its adjacent narrow strip of land can obtain the so-called "security" of the Soviet Union. According to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, "Leningrad is the largest city in the Soviet Union outside of Moscow, and the city's location is only 31 kilometers from the Finnish border. In other words, Leningrad is so close to the foreign border that modern artillery can reach it. Therefore, whether Finland's attitude towards the Soviet Union is friendly or hostile is very important." For this reason, what the Soviet Union is demanding from Finland is: (1) To move the Soviet-Finnish border in the Karelian Isthmus to 100 kilometers north of Leningrad, and compensate Finland with a portion of Soviet Karelia. (2) To lease a small portion of the Gulf of Finland to the Soviet Union for a fixed period of time, so that the Soviet Union can establish a naval base there to ensure the security of the Gulf of Finland. (3) The Soviet Union will exchange a portion of Karelia for certain islands and the Rybachy Peninsula in the Gulf of Finland, as well as the Sredny Peninsula. (4) Finland will fortify the Åland Islands and not allow any third country to participate.</p>
<p>Regarding the above conditions, it is rumored that Finland has allowed the first item. The Soviet Union is naturally not satisfied with this, and Finland believes that this concession is the maximum limit and cannot be conceded any further. Since the negotiations between the two parties have stalled under such circumstances, it is naturally expected that the negotiations will not be easy to continue for a while. Finland's confrontation with the Soviet Union is not of its own volition. Finland knows this, so it dare not rashly resort to force, and the Soviet Union does not seem to have the determination to implement its expansion policy by force. Looking at the attitude of the Baltic countries, although Finland has the sympathy of the countries that signed the Oslo Convention, such as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and the remote support of US President Roosevelt, these are just empty words and there is no necessary solution to the Soviet-Finnish dispute. Originally, the important countries on the Baltic Sea are the Soviet Union and Germany. Germany, of course, can only sit idly by and watch the expansion of the Soviet Union during this war. Germany has advised Finland to strive for a compromise with the Soviet Union. Such advice has no meaning other than to curry favor with the Soviet Union. Although Soviet newspapers have been attacking Finland fiercely in recent days, the diplomatic relations between the two countries have not been interrupted, and the door to negotiations is still open. This shows that although such a dispute has occurred on the Soviet-Finnish border, this may not be a sign of the breakdown of Soviet-Finnish relations, but an opportunity to accelerate the resumption of negotiations. According to Havas News Agency's news yesterday, although Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a note to Finnish Minister to the Soviet Union Skinnari after the dispute occurred on the Soviet-Finnish border, requesting Finland to immediately withdraw its troops 25 kilometers from the border between the two countries, the Soviet note was not issued in the form of an ultimatum, "and the path of consultation is still open. The Soviet Union's intention is probably to force Finland to reopen negotiations." If so, then the Soviet-Finnish dispute is only a local incident that can be resolved soon without causing any major disputes. Originally, every country has become a powder keg during this war. Although Finland is not as powerful as the Soviet Union, its explosive power is also not ignored by the Soviet Union. Therefore, when the Soviet Union does not have the overwhelming certainty, it will not take any actions against Finland that will trigger an explosion. Even the border dispute the day before yesterday cannot be judged in reason as Finland intending to provoke; and the Soviet Union can use this as an invitation to urge Finland to continue negotiations!</p>
<h3>Finland Shells Soviet Border Guards; Soviet Union Lodges Serious Protest; Believes Finnish Troop Concentration is a Hostile Act; Demands Withdrawal of 20 to 25 Kilometers</h3>
<p>Moscow: Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov received Finnish Minister to the Soviet Union Erkko on the evening of the 26th and personally handed him a note from the Soviet government regarding the incident of Finnish troops firing on Soviet troops in the Karelian Isthmus. After accepting the note, Erkko said that he would immediately contact his government to submit a reply as soon as possible. The full text of the Soviet note is as follows: "Your Excellency, according to the report of the General Staff of the Red Army, at 3:45 PM on November 26th, Finnish troops suddenly opened fire on Soviet troops stationed near the village of Mainila in the Karelian Isthmus, not far from the Soviet-Finnish border, firing a total of seven shots, resulting in the death of three Soviet soldiers, one junior commander, and the injury of seven soldiers and two commanders. The Soviet troops had received strict orders not to accept provocations and had not retaliated. When notifying Your Excellency of the above incident, the Soviet government believes that it should draw Your Excellency's attention to the fact that our government recently pointed out the danger of a large number of Finnish regular troops concentrating near the border of Leningrad during negotiations with your country's Tanninen and Paasikivi. Now, as expected, a provocative incident has occurred in which Finnish troops fired on Soviet troops. The Soviet government has to declare that the concentration of Finnish troops near Leningrad is not only a threat to Leningrad, but also a hostile act towards the Soviet Union, which has now led to the attack on Soviet troops, causing deaths and injuries. The Soviet government has no intention of expanding this heinous attack by Finnish troops, the cause of which may be the lack of command of Finnish officials. However, the Soviet government does not want such heinous actions to continue to occur in the future. Therefore, the Soviet government lodges a strong protest against all the events that have occurred and suggests to the Finnish government that Finnish troops be immediately withdrawn 20 to 25 kilometers from the border of the Karelian Isthmus to avoid the recurrence of provocative acts. Sincerely, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov." (TASS, 26th)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to a communique issued by the Leningrad Military District Command, at 3:45 PM on the 26th, Finnish troops suddenly opened fire on Soviet defense forces stationed in the village of Mainila in the Karelian Isthmus. Finnish troops fired a total of seven shots, resulting in the death of 13 Soviet Red Army soldiers, one junior commander, and the injury of seven soldiers, one junior commander, and one second lieutenant. The Director of the First Department of the Leningrad Military District Command, Dykhomolov, has been sent to the area to investigate the actual situation, and the troops stationed in the area shelled by the Finnish troops have expressed extreme indignation at this provocative act. (TASS, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Regarding the border dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union, after Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov submitted a note requesting the Finnish army to withdraw 15 kilometers from the border, the Finnish cabinet held a state meeting at 11:00 AM today to discuss it. According to official sources, the Finnish government will submit a reply. Well-informed sources said that this matter is the initial step of the Soviet Union's "nerve war," attempting to weaken Finland's resistance. However, Finland's position has been repeatedly stated and has not changed so far, and it will not yield to any threats. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The radio station here has just broadcast news on the relations between the Soviet Union and Finland, stating that labor groups across the country held meetings this morning and passed resolutions, briefly stating that the Finnish government, unable to gain the trust of its people, is provoking the Soviet Union. As soon as we receive government orders, we will set off to join the army. Long live the victorious Red Army. It seems that the Finnish border guards should withdraw 25 kilometers from the border as a way to calm things down. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: It is claimed here that regarding the note submitted by the Soviet government to Finland yesterday, the Finnish government is scheduled to submit a reply tomorrow. The reply will be delivered to the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs by Finnish Minister to Russia Kaskinen. Its content is to suggest that the Soviet Union and Finland each send a committee to investigate the border incident, but it refuses the Soviet Union's request for Finland to withdraw its troops 25 miles.

<h3>Finnish Side Denies Border Guards Fired</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Regarding the news of the border dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union issued by the Soviet side, official circles have just issued a bulletin stating, "Finnish border guards did not fire any shots, and Soviet border guard artillery units conducted exercises." In addition, after the Soviet government submitted a note requesting Finnish border guards to withdraw 25 kilometers, the people here were extremely shocked, saying that if this were to be followed, Finland would have to abandon the fortified area of Vyborg, which is it possible to do? Fortunately, the Soviet note is not an ultimatum, and the path of consultation is still open. The Soviet Union's intention is probably to force Finland to reopen negotiations. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Helsinki Information Office stated that after the Soviet official news agency issued a report that Finnish troops had shelled Soviet troops, the Finnish authorities had thoroughly investigated the matter. The facts prove that the Finnish troops did not fire any shots. On the contrary, the troops within the Soviet Union seemed to be practicing throwing hand grenades. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Officer Ordered to Investigate Border Incident</h3>
<p>Moscow: Colonel Tikhomirov, the head of the First Department of the General Staff of the Leningrad Military District, was ordered yesterday afternoon to go to the Soviet-Finnish border to investigate the incident of Finnish troops shelling Soviet troops. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish Diplomatic Relations Not Interrupted; Negotiations Will Resume Soon</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Although a conflict occurred on the Soviet-Finnish border yesterday, political figures in Helsinki believe that Soviet-Finnish negotiations can still begin again within a few days and be resolved in the middle of next week. The Finnish Minister to the Soviet Union visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday. The Soviet side immediately submitted a note requesting Finland to reduce its troops on the Soviet border. Therefore, Soviet-Finnish diplomatic relations have not been interrupted. However, Finnish special envoy Paasikivi, who previously conducted Soviet-Finnish negotiations in Moscow, seems unwilling to contact the Soviet government again. It is reported that the main reason why Paasikivi stopped negotiations with the Soviet government was his disagreement with Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko. When Paasikivi was conducting delicate Soviet-Finnish negotiations in Moscow, Erkko gave a speech accusing the Soviet Union of being used by Britain, which caused resentment on the Soviet side, and the negotiations could not continue. It is said that Paasikivi immediately submitted his resignation at that time and intended to withdraw from diplomatic positions. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<h3>Finland Shoots Down Several Soviet Planes</h3>

<h3>Pravda Ridicules Finnish Prime Minister; Calls Cajander a Clown</h3>
<p>Moscow: Pravda recently published an article criticizing Finnish Prime Minister Cajander, titled "A Clown Occupies the Prime Minister's Position." It said that Cajander belongs to the same class of people as former Polish Foreign Minister Beck and former Polish President Mościcki. Does Cajander also feel the same way as the Polish clowns who have forever lost their position? Finland is now being dragged into a "dangerous prank" by troublemakers. It is hoped that the Finnish people will not allow puppets like Cajander to continue to lead Finland down the path of self-destruction like Beck and Mościcki. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Relations between the Soviet Union and Finland have become tense again. The Communist Party organ Pravda recently published an article by General Gogolev, commander of the Belorussian Military District, briefly stating, "Although our country is willing to avoid war, Finland is preparing for war, evacuating residents, and instructing newspapers to conduct anti-Soviet propaganda to respond to the suggestions put forward by our country. It is obvious that someone is manipulating behind the scenes, hoping to start a war and profit from it." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: Finnish Prime Minister Cajander met with a reporter from the Danish newspaper "Social Democrat" stationed in Helsinki and stated that if the Soviet Union's "Pravda" believes that the Finnish government and parliament disagree, then it is completely unfounded. It is true that the Soviet Union's proposals and Finland's counter-proposals were not discussed at a plenary session of parliament, but the important documents related to determining the negotiation policy were jointly discussed with the Speaker of Parliament and the leaders of various parties, and the progress of the negotiations was fully reported to members of parliament. In addition, the Finnish constitution stipulates that a special secret meeting can be held if more than 20 members of parliament request it, which is unknown to the Soviet Union's "Pravda." (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Troops Continue to Move on the Western Front</h3>
<p>Paris: According to Le Petit Parisien reporter Maurice, German troops are continuing to move in the Aachen area on the German-Belgian and German-Dutch borders. The large-scale deployment is to facilitate the gathering of a large army stationed there, and the troops have been spread out on a wide front, 12 to 20 miles. However, this does not mean that the German army has abandoned its offensive plan, because the troops can be gathered within 48 hours at most. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Shaw's Satire: British Minister of Information</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - The British literary giant George Bernard Shaw, in an interview with a reporter from the "Daily Express" regarding propaganda, suddenly stated, "I believe Germans have a higher level of knowledge of British history than the British have of German history." When the reporter asked if Lord Beaverbrook, the current British Minister of Information, was suitable for the position, Shaw replied, "I wouldn't say Beaverbrook is the least suitable person for this role. In any case, among the current cabinet members, Beaverbrook has the most knowledge of propaganda." When asked, "Would you be a suitable person to assist Beaverbrook?" Shaw's response was even more cold and humorous, "I am a person full of ideals. I can create news to fit any event, and I can create true news, or news that can become true."

<h3>Japanese Troops on the West Side of the Tongpu Railway Concentrated in Anyun, Planning to Invade Southward; Chinese Troops Rushed to Intercept; No Trace of Japanese Troops in the Qikou Area</h3>
<p>Luoyang - Japanese troops in the area west of the Tongpu Railway, including Wanquan, Ronghe, Yishi, and Linjin, have recently been concentrated in Anyun with frequent movements. Currently, there are over 2,000 Japanese troops with eight artillery pieces in Caozhang Town (north of Anyi). The Japanese troops in Anyi and Yuncheng have increased to over 3,000. In the areas of Duncun, Congshan Village, and Zhangdian Town (southeast of Anyi), the Japanese troops have increased to over 2,000. The Japanese troops in the Ershililing area of Yun County have increased to 800-900. They have been conscripting laborers for days and actively constructing fortifications, planning to invade southward. Large forces of the Chinese army are rushing to intercept. (Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Xingji - Fierce fighting took place in the Qikou (north of Jundu) area on the night of the 24th. The Chinese army first captured Beishan, and the remaining Japanese troops stubbornly resisted in the Nanshan and southeastern areas of Qikou. Subsequently, powerful Chinese troops arrived and launched a full-scale encirclement. The Japanese forces were greatly defeated and fled towards Liulin and Lishi. After midnight, the Chinese army continued to mop up the area. By the morning of the 25th, there was no trace of Japanese troops in the Qikou area. (Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Dali - The Chinese army attacked the Taigu East Railway Station on the Tongpu Railway the night before. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and were breached through three layers of barbed wire. One part engaged in street fighting with the Japanese troops, while another part rushed into the Japanese barracks and warehouses, seizing many rifles, 7,000 rounds of ammunition, three boxes of hand grenades, seventy bayonets, over ten war knives, and many other military supplies. They also burned down all the Japanese barracks and warehouses. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements arrived, and the Chinese troops safely withdrew. In this battle, over 120 Japanese soldiers were killed. (Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Shanzhou - Over 2,000 Japanese troops were continuously added to Changzhi, Changzi, and other places on the 21st.

Japanese reinforcements from Hetou Village arrived, and the fierce battle lasted all night, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Japanese soldiers. (Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<h3>Wubucheng Once Recovered</h3>
<p>Gaoan - The Chinese army launched an attack on the Japanese troops in Wubucheng, south of Fengxin, on the evening of the 26th, engaging in a fierce battle with over 500 Japanese troops. At around 1:00 AM on the 27th, they once recovered Wubucheng, killing over 100 Japanese soldiers and capturing many rifles, helmets, military uniforms, and documents. Subsequently, the Japanese greatly reinforced their forces from the Fengxin area. The Chinese army, considering that the mission had been accomplished, retreated safely. (Telegraph, 27th)</p>

<h3>Chamberlain's Speech: War Strategy and Peace Objectives: Must Abandon Aggression and Negotiate as Equals; Condemned Germany's Tactics as Inhumane</h3>
<p>London - At 9:15 tonight, Prime Minister Chamberlain broadcast a speech, first recounting his speech on September 3rd. He then stated, "Ten weeks since the start of the war, I am speaking to the public again, still holding the belief that the Anglo-French Allied countries will surely achieve final victory. We should not imitate Germany's actions, concealing our own losses and falsely creating enemy losses. We will report all events truthfully, even if the people do not like to hear them, except for those that would aid the enemy. We never conceal anything. The progress of the war is proceeding in a way that is quite different from what was expected. Germany has not launched a large-scale offensive on land, nor has it launched a fierce attack on Britain from the air. This is not because Germany has a sense of humanity. We have various evidence to prove that Germany has never considered humanity in the war methods it considers advantageous. The reason why it does not engage in decisive battles on land and in the air is that it knows such attacks would not be worth the cost. Therefore, it prefers to use methods that do not harm itself. Its latest method is to place new types of mines in our territorial waters, disregarding the international treaties it has signed and, even more so, disregarding neutral ships, causing many casualties among neutral nationals. Germany hopes to cut off our overseas supply and force us to starve and surrender with this barbaric tactic. However, this attempt is doomed to fail. We don't need to worry about this. We will eventually subdue magnetic mines, just like we subdued submarines. Although the British side has suffered some losses, the escort system is still proceeding perfectly, and merchant ships are still entering and leaving British ports. This is due to the courage, boldness, and excellent skills of the British merchant ship and escort ship personnel. Britain is fighting to protect freedom and establish peace. Freedom and peace are the two major principles that are closely related to the survival of the British Empire. Now, the entire British Empire is generously and quickly providing material and spiritual assistance to Britain in order to achieve the goal of protecting freedom and establishing peace, which is truly commendable."</p>
<p>Chamberlain continued to speak about the difficulties and inconveniences caused by air defense, saying that once these defense measures can be lifted and the public is safe from excessive danger, the government will definitely lift them. However, now is not the time to rashly lift them. Now, some people may ask why the Anglo-French Allied forces do not exert their divine power to inflict greater blows on Germany. It must be understood that tactics involve concentrating the greatest strength at the appropriate time and in the appropriate location. This location and time must now be determined by the Allied commanders. In terms of time, the Allied forces now have the advantage. The blockade of Germany is becoming increasingly severe. The supply of essential raw materials needed for Germany's new type of warfare, which Germany cannot produce, is gradually being cut off. Britain and France, on the other hand, have inexhaustible human and material resources. With this advantage, victory is indeed assured, but the question is how long it will take to achieve the common goal. Our war aim is to defeat the enemy, not only to destroy the enemy's military forces but also to eliminate the enemy's aggressive mentality, which always seeks to dominate others by force. This mentality takes pleasure in trampling on innocent people and justifies betraying faith at any time and place in the name of national interest. If the German people can realize that this kind of spirit is detrimental to themselves and others, then they should abandon it. If this is the case, then it would be ideal if it could be achieved without bloodshed. However, this spirit must be abandoned. This is our war aim. We will continue to fight until this aim is achieved.</p>
<p>Chamberlain then spoke about the aim of peace, saying, "Our ambition is to create a new Europe. This does not mean redrawing the map of Europe according to the will of the victors, but rather that the countries have a new spirit, willing to treat each other with goodwill and to deal with difficulties with mutual patience. In the new Europe, there must no longer be any aggression or fear. All necessary boundary adjustments must be resolved by the countries attending a round table conference on an equal footing, and if necessary, with the assistance of an impartial third country. Commerce among European countries should have ample opportunities for circulation, and there should also be the right to determine their own political systems without harming the policies of neighboring countries. If Europe cannot be like this, then it cannot be considered to have lasting peace. Armaments should be regarded as useless waste and gradually reduced, leaving only a portion to maintain domestic law and order. This matter will take several years to complete, so there must be an agency that can guide the new Europe to proceed along the appropriate path. It is hoped that Germany will also be moved by this new spirit and participate in this work." (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Coordinate Military Supplies; Appoint Monnet to Preside</h3>
<p>London - Today, the official announcement stated that the British Prime Minister and the French Premier have jointly appointed Monnet as Chairman of the Anglo-French Coordinating Committee. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France previously held a joint meeting in London and decided to organize various joint standing committees to coordinate the war efforts of both sides in the areas of air combat, munitions, petroleum, and food supply, shipping, and economic warfare, and to establish a joint coordinating committee to oversee all these efforts. Premier Daladier recently met with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and jointly appointed Monnet as Chairman of the Joint Coordinating Committee. This gentleman is an economic expert who resided in the United States for a long time and, from 1933 to 1935, went to China on behalf of the League of Nations to assist the National Government in carrying out economic reconstruction work. He served as the Paris representative of the China Development Finance Corporation. According to reports, the coordination of the purchase of aircraft and armaments from Canada and the United States by Britain and France has already been implemented, and other coordination work has also begun. When necessary, the cabinet members of Britain and France will hold meetings in London or Paris. As for general political issues, joint meetings of the Supreme Defense Council of both countries will still be held to address them. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>British King Orders Blockade of German Trade; Iran and Other Countries File Protests; Italian Cabinet Minister Vigorously Condemns Britain</h3>
<p>London - King George VI convened a Privy Council this morning and immediately signed an order to implement a blockade of German export trade. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>London - The order permitting the confiscation of German exports has been approved by the British King today and will be published tomorrow with an explanatory statement. Reuters has learned that the authorities drafted this order with close attention to the interests of neutral countries. This order may be delayed for several days to allow the agencies handling this matter to minimize friction. The British government will send a copy of the explanatory statement to the embassies of various neutral countries separately. In addition, the notes to the four countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Japan may be further answered. According to information obtained by Reuters, the policy of this cabinet order will be the same as that issued in the last World War, and there is reason to believe that this confiscation of German exports will be more effective this time than in the last World War, because Germany now has to purchase goods with cash and is extremely lacking in cash. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Tehran, Capital of Iran - After Britain and France decided to blockade German export trade, the Iranian government filed a protest with Britain. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>The Hague - According to well-informed sources here, the Scandinavian newspapers published reports that the Dutch government was preparing to launch a joint action by neutral countries on the issue of the blockade. They strongly emphasized that it is too early to talk about political cooperation between the Netherlands and various neutral countries. The Dutch government has not made specific proposals to the Nordic countries, but the Netherlands, in principle, does not oppose taking responsibility for representing the common interests of various neutral countries when necessary. The Netherlands' independent policy does not absolutely exclude the possibility of political cooperation among various neutral countries under certain circumstances. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Oslo - The Norwegian government has now instructed its ambassador to Britain to lodge a protest with the British government regarding the tightening of blockade measures by Britain, believing that the new British blockade measures will have serious consequences for neutral shipping. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome - Fascist Party Supreme Council member and Minister without Portfolio Farinacci recently published an article in the "Fascist Regime" newspaper, fiercely attacking Britain. He said, "Britain's decision to blockade German export trade and inspect neutral ships to confiscate German exports is extremely serious. The situation is like a rope, which will break if pulled too tight. In short, Britain is almost an enemy of humanity." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Today, a Reuters reporter asked the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to clarify his statement that Britain had agreed not to interfere with German export goods carried on neutral ships. The response was that the British government had issued a statement on this matter on September 22nd. The Japanese Embassy in Britain had sent a form inquiring about the points of the British blockade to the British Ministry of Economic Warfare in September. On April 22nd, the Ministry notified the Japanese Embassy that British authorities would not take any action against neutral ships carrying German goods to neutral countries, even within British territorial waters. The spokesperson also said that he did not know that Japan had actually implemented this interception method in the last World War. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Admiralty Announces Another Warship Sunk: Former Merchant Ship Rawalpindi; Only Seventeen Crew Members Rescued; One Dutch and One Polish Mail Ship Sunk by Mines</h3>
<p>London - The Admiralty recently announced that the British India Steam Navigation Company's 17,000-ton merchant ship Rawalpindi, which was armed and converted into a cruiser after the start of the war, has now sunk. Except for seventeen crew members, it is feared that all the crew members have been killed. Two-thirds of the crew were naval ratings, and the rest were naval reservists. The proportion of senior personnel was similar. The ship used to sail between Britain and Japan. When the war broke out, it abandoned its peaceful operations and was commissioned by the Admiralty. It was docked for several weeks to remove its luxurious decorations and mount cannons on its sides. It was painted gray, hoisted a white flag, and sailed out again. It had thus been transformed from a merchant ship into a cruiser, becoming one of the warships of the British Navy, unlike merchant ships equipped with self-defense armaments that still engage in maritime trade. Purely self-defense armed merchant ships, which risk German submarines and mine activity and still engage in trade in the world's seas, do not mount cannons on the sides or bow but strictly abide by international law and only mount cannons on the stern and install anti-aircraft guns. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>The Hague - The Dutch mail ship "Spaarndam" (weighing 8,857 tons, built in 1932) sank at noon today after hitting a water mine in the Thames estuary in England. All crew members have been rescued. The circumstances of the accident are still unknown. This ship left New Orleans, USA, on September 22nd and was intercepted by a British warship en route. It then sailed to Downs, England, on October 10th and was released after inspection. It immediately sailed to Gravesend, England, and sailed out of that port this morning, thus hitting a mine and sinking. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>London - It has been learned that the Polish mail ship "Pilsudski" (14,294 tons) has sunk in the North Sea, reportedly after hitting two German mines. 247 crew members and passengers were rescued by a British destroyer and landed at various ports. Seven people are still missing. The ship's captain, after being injured, insisted on waiting until all the crew members and passengers had left the ship before he would leave, and eventually died. According to eyewitnesses, the ship was blown into two pieces and sank in just two minutes. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Polish semi-official news agency PAT published a message stating that the Polish mail ship "Pilsudski" (weighing 14,294 tons) was sunk by a torpedo in the sea northwest of England this morning (London cable says it hit a mine). Most of the crew members have been rescued. This magnificent ship used to sail between Gdynia and North America, but since the outbreak of the European war, it has been reassigned to British use. It was one of the newest ships in the Polish merchant fleet, having been built only four years ago. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen - A German fishing boat recently accidentally hit a mine near the site where a German guard ship sank on Saturday and sank within a minute. The German guard ship hit a mine near Langeland but did not sink until half an hour later. Some of the crew members were rescued. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Information announced that it is now able to control the movement of German magnetic mines. The authorities are recruiting 2,000 volunteers to drive 200 fishing boats to engage in mine sweeping. The response has been very enthusiastic, exceeding the required number of people. These fishing boats are under the fleet's command and form the reserve fishing boat team. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>London - The Admiralty recently announced that the German cargo ship "Börgen," sailing from Montevideo, Uruguay, back to Germany, was intercepted by a British warship in the Atlantic Ocean. The ship was immediately dispatched with sailors to escort it to a port in this country. It was attacked by a German submarine en route and ran aground as a result. All British sailors have landed safely, while four German sailors have been killed. In addition, the German cargo ship "Weisse" has also been captured and has been escorted to a port in England. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>London - A pilot boat ran aground in Mersey this morning, and twenty people were tragically killed. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>London - Eleven British ships, totaling 25,787 tons, sank last week, as well as four neutral ships, totaling 23,449 tons, and two French ships, totaling over 3,000 tons, also sank last week. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German ship "Ulm" was scuttled in the South Atlantic by its crew to avoid interception by British warships. The official announcement stated that 127 crew members and 35 passengers, including 18 women, have been rescued. The incident proves that the British Admiralty is using armed merchant ships to complete military missions, as the British armed merchant ship had been following the "Ulm" ship and sending wireless reports to the British warship.

<h3>US Foreign Policy Association Statement: Japanese Aggression Against the Philippines Would Be a Declaration of War Against the US; Admiral Hepburn Visits Philippine President; Overseas Chinese Newspapers in the Philippines Criticize Borah</h3>
<p>Washington - According to a report by the US Foreign Policy Association today on US-Japanese relations, "If Japan takes direct action against the Philippines, the United States will regard it as a declaration of war by Japan against the United States. If Japan adopts a more clever strategy, postponing its plans to seize the Philippines, or attacking in other directions, the United States may adopt a neutral attitude." It also stated that if Japan invades the Far Eastern territories of Britain, France, and the Netherlands, it will also encounter many difficulties. Although Japan's military strategic location has improved considerably at present, if there is military action in the southeast of East Asia, it will prolong its transportation lines, and it will be necessary to draw troops from its current troops stationed in China and on the Soviet border of "Manchukuo." Its navy will also be dispersed and unable to concentrate, and its merchant fleet will disappear from the seas of various countries. Therefore, according to the report's judgment, Japan may emulate Hitler and first seize the places that are easier to reach. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Manila - US Fleet Commander Admiral Hepburn visited Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon at Malacañang Palace today, talking for half an hour. It is reported that Admiral Hepburn and US Consul General to Shanghai Gauss will also visit US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre in Baguio this week. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Manila - The overseas Chinese newspaper "China Commercial News" here criticized US isolationist Senator Borah for adopting a pro-Japanese attitude on the issue of abolishing the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, arguing that the United States must carefully consider before severing US-Japan commercial relations. The article was titled "Four Hundred Million Yuan and Four Hundred Million Lives." It stated, "The Japanese militarists are using US steel, petroleum, and other military supplies to engage in conquest in the Far East, which seems to be of no concern to Borah, who only knows profit. At the same time, the millions of innocent women, children, and civilians who have been massacred by aircraft, artillery, and bombs made from US raw materials do not seem to be enough to move Borah's heart. But what we cannot help but say to Borah is that even if the sacrifice of Chinese lives is not worth cherishing, US commerce with China will definitely not survive. In other words, if the United States does not abolish the commercial treaty with Japan, Japan will be able to establish its so-called 'New Order in East Asia' with the help of the United States." Then, not all of China's four hundred million people may be destroyed, but the United States' four hundred million in commerce will be completely eliminated. If Japan can completely control China's markets and raw materials, Japan will not only expel the United States from the Far East but will also threaten the security of the Western Hemisphere. Borah believes that if the United States continues to sign a new commercial treaty with Japan, it cannot be regarded as tacitly approving Japan's aggressive actions and the 'New Order in East Asia.' But from our perspective, the United States supplies Japan with military supplies and raw materials, not only tacitly approving but also effectively supporting Japan's barbaric conquest. Therefore, if Borah's plan is actually implemented, then the United States, although it does not lose its spiritual sympathy for China, can be said to be of no help in practice. On the contrary, it has not provided moral assistance to Japan, but it has provided effective material assistance." (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Manila - According to a report in the Philippine newspaper "Kozan News" today, a Japanese named Nakamura was taking photos of the fortresses and airfields near Olongapo City last week. He was arrested by the local police, and the negatives he had taken were confiscated. The results of the inspection confirmed that they were of the various positions of the fortresses and airfields. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>New Orleans - Former Philippine Supreme Court Justice Malcolm stated today as he departed for Puerto Rico to take up his post as Attorney General that if the United States grants the Philippines complete independence, Japan will immediately invade the Philippines. "After the United States abandons the Philippines, Japan will rise up to take the Philippines as its own. This is an open secret, because the Philippines is rich in gold, manganese, chromium, and petroleum resources, all of which Japan urgently needs. However, the Japanese may not immediately develop the oil fields, because the Dutch East Indies is rich in existing oil fields." (United Press, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japan and Thailand Reach Aviation Agreement; To Be Implemented in February Next Spring</h3>

<h3>The Asahi Shimbun Strongly Advocates for Amity with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun claims that as a result of talks between Foreign Minister Nomura and Soviet Ambassador Smetanin, the adjustment of Japanese-Soviet relations has returned to the right track. This new situation has caused excitement among the Japanese people who recall the tension in Japanese-Soviet relations in recent years. In recent years, the Soviet Union believed that the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany must contain secret military clauses, so it adopted a threatening attitude towards Japan, leading to disputes over fishing rights for Japanese people in North Sakhalin, border conflicts that often occurred, and ultimately, the battle of Nomonhan where tens of thousands of Japanese and Soviet troops slaughtered each other. The Japanese government now only needs to notify the Soviet Union that Japan is prepared to (1) accept the Soviet Union's realistic views, (2) recognize Japanese-Soviet tension as unnecessary and foolish, and (3) promote peace in the Far East. Japan can now abandon its previous international relations and, from a position without obstacles, engage in the adjustment of Japanese-Soviet relations. However, whether Japanese-Soviet relations can improve in the future depends on the Soviet Union's decision. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in East and West River Areas of Guangdong Support the Japanese Troops Invading Southern Guangdong, Again Stirring on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Line, Threatening to Attack Zhongshan Again on a Set Date</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence - Japanese troops entrenched in various places in the East, West, and North River areas and Jiangmen and Xinhui, in order to respond to the invasion of Southern Guangdong and contain Chinese military forces, have been stirring up trouble in recent days. The following is a record of their actions:</p>
<p>East River Area</p>
<p>Japanese troops stationed on the south bank of the East River in Dongguan and Baoan have been dispatched from Shilong and Shenzhen since the 18th, attempting to attack the central section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway from the north and south, and then open up the entire line. Their ambitions are great, and their momentum is fierce. On the morning of the 18th, when the Japanese troops in Shenzhen attacked northward, more than 500 Japanese troops, including infantry and cavalry, with several cannons, crossed the Jinshui River and attacked the positions of the Chinese army in Hengli and Tutang, along with the Tea Mountain, Nanshe, and puppet troops. The regular Chinese army Chen regiment, the security force Zhang regiment, and the guerrilla Liu unit, which were guarding the area, separately intercepted them at key points. The Japanese army first bombarded the Chinese positions with artillery fire and advanced with cavalry to cover the infantry. The Chinese army calmly responded under the fierce artillery fire and aerial bombardment of the Japanese army. The Japanese army charged several times but could not cross the Chinese defense line. In the evening, the Japanese army, seeing that the Chinese positions were strong and suffering heavy casualties, was forced to retreat and collapsed towards Chashan Jing Mountain. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue them. On the morning of the 19th, the Japanese army, knowing that it was difficult to succeed, mostly fled back to Shilong. The Chinese army is still searching for remnants and deploying new positions in Chashan and Nanshe to prevent the Japanese army from launching another attack. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 200 casualties and left more than 50 corpses. As for the Japanese troops who attacked northward along the Sha-Shen and Guangzhou-Kowloon roads from Shenzhen, they were intercepted by the Chinese army Yu Brigade, Yun Chunlin, Chen Division, and Ni Dingyuan on the 18th and 19th, and fierce battles were fought at Tiantangwei Ferry and other places. The Japanese army suffered 400 to 500 casualties. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Chinese army in Qingxi, Tangxia, Longgang, and other places joined the battle and launched a counterattack against the Japanese army. The Japanese army could not resist. By evening, the Japanese troops near Hengkang had returned to Shawan, and the Japanese troops on the Guangzhou-Kowloon front had also crossed the river from Tiantangwei and moved back to Pinghu and Buji. The Chinese army Yu Brigade and Yun Regiment took advantage of the situation and advanced, with the vanguard once crossing Pinghu and engaging in a night battle with more than 100 Japanese troops. Later, due to strategic considerations, they retreated to their original positions. On the 20th, just after dawn, four Japanese planes flew from the sea off Dachan, covering the Japanese troops in Pinghu and Shawan and continuing to retreat to Shenzhen. The Japanese planes then flew over the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Sha-Shen, Hui-Zhang, and Ping-Tan lines to reconnoiter and dropped bombs on Tangxia, Qingxi, Lin Village, Hengli, and other places. Chinese losses are unknown. After the Japanese army captured Nantou and Shenzhen, they repeatedly attempted to open up the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and occupy Shark Bay, Kwai Tung, and Salt Field to cut off the Chinese army's external communication and liaison in the East River area. The Chinese military authorities, aware of the Japanese army's conspiracy, have been continuously dispatching large forces to the counties of Dong, Bao, and Hui to increase defenses. It is now learned that Xiang Hanping, Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Director of the Guerrilla Command Post of the 9th Army Group, who is responsible for military affairs in the East River area, believes that the Japanese army launched two-way attacks from Shilong and Shenzhen this time to attack the Chinese army in order to open up the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and invade Huiyang. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of various units bravely resisted and inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army's ambitions have not diminished, and it is difficult to guarantee that they will not seize the opportunity to launch another attack. In order to strengthen the military strength in Dong and Bao and tighten control over the Japanese army, a cable has been sent to the Fourth War Zone authorities to dispatch a large army to increase defenses in various places and redeploy the offensive and defensive positions on the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Sha-Shen, Hui-Zhang, and Ping-Long lines in order to be able to attack and encircle and annihilate the Japanese army in order to consolidate the defense on the south bank of the East River.</p>
<p>West River Area</p>
<p>Japanese troops in the lower reaches of the West River have been frequently mobilized in the past week. Japanese military vehicles travel daily on the Guangzhou-Sanshui line from Guangzhou to Foshan, and the carriage windows are tightly closed when traveling, which seems very secretive. In addition, Japanese troops in Sanshui, Southwest, Hekou, Makou, and other places have been transferred to Foshan, Jiujiang, and other places in recent days. The number of Japanese troops in Jiujiang, Heqing, Honglou, Longchi Jitang, Datang, and other places has slightly increased. More than 100 Japanese engineers have been actively strengthening fortifications in the Da Gang and Chongliang Gang areas near Jiujiang. Two Japanese shallow-water warships are moored on the Jiujiang Shakou River. More than 50 Japanese motorboats and rubber boats travel daily on the waterway from Shakou to Jiangmen, transporting grain and military supplies. Obviously, there are plans for invasion on the West River.</p>
<p>Jiang-Hui Area</p>
<p>After the Japanese army began invading Qinlian, they instigated traitors to spread rumors everywhere, saying that they would attack Zhongshan again before the 20th of this month and seize Sanbu, the throat of Siyi, on a certain date. The leaflets dropped by Japanese planes in Zhongshan County also made the same propaganda, hoping to shake people's hearts. The Chinese military authorities, upon receiving the report, ordered a certain unit of the Western Front assault force to advance towards Mulang along the Xin-He Line. In order to prevent the Chinese army from advancing, the Japanese artillery at Foziao continuously fired remotely at the Chinese army positions in Duruan and Ximao Mountain. On the morning of the 17th, the Japanese army took advantage of the heavy fog to launch a counterattack against the Chinese army at Gelao Huai and invaded Zhongshan at the same time. As a result, they were repelled. On the night of the 19th, the moonlight was dim, and the Japanese army, fearing a night attack by the Chinese army, had a Japanese plane fly over the border of Zhongshan and directly to the Xin-He Line, circling for several hours in the Jinggen, Duruan, Pingdi Ling, Ximao Mountain, and Niushan areas, hoping to intimidate the Chinese guerrillas. After the Japanese army's invasion of Xikeng on the Xinkai Line failed, there have been no major movements in the past two days.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Chinese Army Presses Attack on Chaoan; Commander of Japanese Troops in Chenghai Killed; Japanese Aircraft Harass Various Places Repeatedly</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence - Japanese troops in Chaoan, under the control of Chinese artillery at Zhugaoshan, have not invaded Fengxi for many days. It was not until the 5th that they launched an attack on the Chinese positions by land and sea, and aircraft were dispatched from Shantou to fight. Two planes dropped bombs on Yixi, Hulushi, Wenshi City, Zhangwang and other villages, and strafed the Yixi-Fenghuang Highway, destroying more than 30 civilian houses, killing and wounding more than ten people, and bombing seven oxen to death. In the afternoon, Chinese reinforcements from Fengshun arrived and crossed the Shipailou Zhuhang on the same night, surrounding and attacking the Japanese troops in Qiulang Mountain and Hulushi. The Japanese troops were quite chaotic. More than 300 people entered Yixi and were all wiped out. The 5th Battalion of the Raoping Chinese Army and part of the Security Force responded across the river, pressing the attack on Hanshan Weicun and surrounding more than 100 Japanese troops in the village. After about an hour of fierce fighting, 60 to 70 people were beheaded and captured. The Japanese troops stationed in Hanshan rushed to the scene, and the Chinese army immediately withdrew. After the 6th, the Chinese army returned to its original positions, erected troops and cannons at Qiulang Mountain and Zhugaoshan, and exchanged artillery fire with the Japanese troops in Hanshan. On the same day, three Japanese planes flew to Xingning County and dropped four bombs, destroying more than ten shops, killing five people, and wounding several people. Another two planes dropped six bombs in Tangkeng Jiuzhaizhai, Fengshun. Also, at 8:00 AM on the same day, another five Japanese planes flew to Raoping, Zhaolin, and Huanggang and dropped more than ten bombs, killing and wounding more than ten civilians.</p>
<p>On the 5th, the puppet pacification troops stationed in Chenghai City gathered at the county middle school playground for inspection. When the Japanese commander Nakamura was standing on the stage giving a speech, gunshots suddenly rang out in front of the stage. It turned out that the Chinese plainclothes team had rushed in and killed Nakamura on the spot. Translator Lin Taisanmen was seriously injured. After this blow, the Japanese army detained all the puppet troops who were inspected in the Chenghuang Temple, dispatched more than 300 Japanese troops to closely monitor the 5th Regiment of the puppet army, and transferred 200 people to Anbu to disperse the strength of the puppet army. On the 7th, the Chinese army's counterattack on Chaoan was very urgent, and the Japanese army urgently mobilized 200 cavalry and 500 to 600 infantry to deploy outside Shantou. In front of the Shantou Customs, there were only two or three Japanese warships moored. On the morning of the 8th, two transport ships entered the port, transporting 700 to 800 Japanese troops. In the afternoon, the number of Japanese warships continued to increase, unloading military supplies and grain to land. On the morning of the 9th, there were 13 Japanese warships in Shantou Port, moored in Nan'ao, Dahao, and Tuojiang Estuary. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, five Japanese fast armored boats transported more than 200 Japanese soldiers into the Hanjiang tributary to reinforce the defense of Chenghai Chaoan. The Horino Command Headquarters stationed in Anbu has been moved to Zhongshan Park. Judging from the hurried dispatch and mobilization of the Japanese army, it is evident that the fighting in the Chaoan area is intensifying.</p>
<p>According to those who fled to Shantou, the Japanese army suffered a disastrous defeat in Yixi on the 5th, with more than 400 to 500 killed and wounded, resulting in huge losses. The Japanese army was unwilling to accept this, and from the 8th, the artillery at Hulushan bombarded the villages of Yixi, Qiulang Mountain, Zhuhang, and Wenshi City from afar. Fifteen Japanese planes also flew to the highways of Meixian, Pingyuan, Xunwu, and Xingning and dropped bombs. Twenty bombs were dropped on Pingyuan, Datuo, and Bachih. Also, when Japanese planes arrived in Meixian, the Chinese air defense forces engaged in an air-to-ground battle on a certain mountaintop. After 30 minutes, two Japanese planes were hit and emitted white smoke and fled in embarrassment. On the 9th, artillery battles broke out again in the suburbs of Chaoan. Fifteen Japanese planes flew out again to harass the rear of the Chinese army, dropping more than 20 huge bombs in Meixian and Xingning, circling the Mei-Song Road and Mei-Xing Road for five hours, and firing wildly at passing boats and vehicles. In the second time, five planes arrived in Meicheng, and two or thirty large houses of various surnames in the market were destroyed. Seventy to eighty civilians were killed or injured. Chenghuang and Tang, Pankeng Tian were also bombed. On the evening of the 9th, the Fengshun Chinese artillery arrived at Yixi Qiulang Mountain and fired remotely at Chaoan City, destroying many Japanese positions, with eight out of ten hits. On the same night, the Chinese army set out from Zhuhang, bypassed Fengxi, and engaged in battle with more than 200 Japanese troops on the Anjie Highway outside the South Gate at 2:00 AM on the 10th, advancing into West Lake and engaging in a bloody battle. The Chinese artillery at Zhugaoshan fully exerted its power to assist in attacking the North Gate. A cavalry unit of 120 men, wielding spears and broadswords, charged into the Japanese barracks at Chuncheng Tower in the South Gate. Fifty Japanese troops stationed there were all stabbed to death by spears. The bloody battle continued until dawn, and the Chinese army retreated. Both sides only had artillery battles. A large-scale battle is about to break out within days outside the city of Chaozhou.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Four Banks Handle Debt Donation; Citizens Should Unite in Contributions; Not a Small Benefit to the Future of the War of Resistance; Four Banks Set Up Specialized Departments to Accept Debt Donations</h3>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association recently launched a debt donation campaign. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China have volunteered to handle the reception of this debt donation work to promote it. The Bank of China handles this matter on behalf of Hong Kong and overseas locations. The Shanghai branches of the four banks have set up specialized departments to handle this. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Advocates for a Debt Donation Campaign</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association, in view of the fact that after the outbreak of the Japanese invasion of China, the government authorities, in order to concentrate financial resources, prepare for a long-term war of resistance, and lay the foundation for final victory, have successively issued National Salvation Bonds, National Defense Bonds, and Gold Bonds during this period of war. The people of the whole country unanimously support the leader, support the national policy of resisting aggression and building the nation, and are enthusiastically involved in purchasing these bonds. People from friendly countries overseas who sympathize with China's war of resistance also purchased Chinese bonds. In order to maintain creditworthiness, the government issued bond interest on schedule in accordance with the regulations. Now, in order to reduce the government's financial burden and gather more funds to continue the war of resistance, the association has launched a debt donation campaign, asking the people and people from friendly countries who hold these bonds to voluntarily donate them to the National Government. It is of no small benefit to the war of resistance, and its significance is particularly significant.</p>
<p>The Four Banks Volunteer to Handle It</p>
<p>The head offices of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, believing that the debt donation campaign has been launched by the New Life Movement, have already volunteered to handle the reception of this debt donation work in order to assist and promote this matter. On the one hand, they were ordered by the central government to order their branches and offices in various provinces and cities across the country to start handling this work at the same time. As for Hong Kong and overseas countries, the branches of the Bank of China in various countries are fully authorized to handle this matter.</p>
<p>Shanghai Four Branches Obey Orders and Handle Debt Donations</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai branches of the four banks, the head office has already ordered the commencement of this debt donation work. In addition to the Bank of China ordering the National Treasury to handle it, the other three branches of the Central, Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China have set up specialized departments to handle this matter. Regarding the debt donation method, if Chinese and foreigners hold these bonds and present them to the four banks, the handling bank may issue a temporary receipt. On the one hand, they will collect the bond certificates and numbers and submit them to the head office authorities. Then, they will submit them to the National Treasury for safekeeping. On the one hand, they will cancel the bond rights held by the debt donors one by one, and the lottery numbers of the bonds that are due in the future will no longer be included. The procedures are very simple. I hope that all bondholders will actively promote this righteous act of debt donation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Widen the Yunzaobing to Convert it into a Commercial Port</h3>
<p>Yunzaobing is the only inland river in Wusong, with a width of more than twenty feet, stretching westward for dozens of miles, directly to Changshu and Kunshan. Since the fall of the Song District, it has been occupied by the Japanese army and used as a military food zone. It is now learned that the Japanese plan to convert Yunzaobing into a commercial port, widening the river surface by about sixty feet, and building wharves and warehouses next to it, in an attempt to restore its former prosperity and make it a base for dumping Japanese goods.</p>
<h3>Japanese Deny Searching British Residence; British Consulate Confirms Protest</h3>
<p>At 3:00 AM on the 23rd of this month, six Japanese Naval Landing Force sailors suddenly broke down the door of the residence of British citizen Mr. Santos, located at No. 24, Lane 506, North Sichuan Road, and searched the premises. However, even though Mr. Santos showed them his British passport, they ignored it. Last night, a Japanese naval spokesman denied at a press briefing that the Marine Corps had searched the aforementioned residence. It was claimed that the searched residence was located in the Huajie Liuxiang area. Residences in and around that area are regularly searched by Marine Corps members. Marine Corps searchers try their best to avoid making foreign residents uncomfortable, so they immediately withdraw when they encounter foreign residences and do not enter, etc. According to reports, the incident on the 23rd was that six members of the Japanese Marine Corps entered Mr. Santos' residence. Mr. Santos initially refused, but then showed his passport, but the Japanese soldiers did not listen and pushed Mr. Santos aside, thoroughly searching the house. Afterwards, the British Consulate protested.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Manufactured Products Prohibited from Being Sold in the Interior; National Goods Industry Attaches Importance; Does it Include the Concession Area? National Goods Organizations Cable Authorities for Inquiry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Industry has attached importance to the report that Chongqing has cabled that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has ordered that, from now on, manufactured products from the occupied areas, including those manufactured in Shanghai, are not allowed to be imported into the areas controlled by the Chinese government. The various national goods organizations will cable the authorities to inquire whether the so-called "including those manufactured in Shanghai" also includes the concession area. After the war, the sales of Shanghai national goods manufacturers in the interior were very difficult due to traffic obstructions. Only the South Seas still had considerable monthly sales. If sales in the interior are now prohibited, then they will have no place to stand. However, the authorities' adoption of this policy is actually a countermeasure against Japanese goods being falsely labeled as national goods and mixed in the interior, destroying the war economy, and they have no choice but to take this measure.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marine Corps Commander Visits Fan Ke Ling</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, the Commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, Major General Takeda Seiji, along with his adjutant and interpreter, went to the Public Works Department to formally pay a visit to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), Fan Ke Ling. Six Japanese military policemen accompanied them for protection. The Central Police Department also temporarily dispatched more than ten detectives to set up posts in the Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road area. Forty armed White Russian members of the SMC's Shanghai Volunteer Corps formed a guard of honor. Major General Takeda Seiji and Chairman Fan Ke Ling met for about 30 minutes, and he left around 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Relief Conference: 100 Exquisite Potted Plants Prepared for Auction by Dancing Stars</h3>
<p>The fellow-townsmen group organized a chrysanthemum relief charity sale to raise money for winter clothing for the needy. Despite the severe cold weather in recent days, the number of visitors who came to view and purchase flowers was constant. Since the opening, more than 3,000 pots have been sold. Now, another 500 pots of fine varieties have been transported here, arranged inside the venue for guests to choose and buy. One hundred of the most exquisite potted plants are prepared for competitive appreciation by dancing stars. Yesterday, the Shanghai Wireless Electrical Material Industry Association collectively purchased 10 yuan of relief tickets. Fellow-townsman groups also sold hundreds of yuan each.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese from Fujian Return to Southeast Asia to Continue Business</h3>
<p>A large number of overseas Chinese residing in Southeast Asia are engaged in business. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, these compatriots have been particularly concerned about the situation of the war in their homeland. When the Japanese army invaded Guangdong and Fujian provinces last year, the Guangdong and Fujian overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia returned to their motherland to engage in various wartime tasks to defend their hometowns. At that time, no less than several thousand overseas Chinese from Fujian returned to the country from Southeast Asia. Later, with the fall of Xiamen, traffic between the province and Southeast Asia was suddenly blocked. The overseas Chinese could neither return to Southeast Asia nor develop in the interior, so they moved to Quanzhou, Xinghua and other places. It is now known that these overseas Chinese still have businesses in Southeast Asia, and since returning to the country, it has been almost a year. Now that the navigation between Xinghua, Quanzhou and Shanghai has also been restored, they are rushing to Shanghai by boat, preparing to transfer to Southeast Asia to continue their business. More than 700 people have arrived in Shanghai in recent days. They are being received separately by the Shanxi, Jinjiang, and Hui'an fellow-townsmen associations in Shanghai and are lodging in hotels. The first batch of more than 300 people are scheduled to take the Java Mail Steamship Company's "Tjisadane" on the 30th of this month, departing from Shanghai directly to Southeast Asia to continue their business.</p>
<h3>Gold Public Bonds, National Defense Public Bonds: Overseas Payment Methods; Not Entrusting Other Overseas Branches of the Bank of China for the Time Being; The Receiving Bank Will Take Payment From the Bank of Communications</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a circular to overseas Chinese organizations stating that the first redemption of principal and interest for the 1938 Gold Public Bonds and National Defense Public Bonds will be on October 31st of this year. All matters concerning the redemption of principal and interest, regarding the Gold Public Bonds, the overseas portion will be managed and paid by the four banks, the Hong Kong branch, or other overseas branches of the Bank of China. Regarding the National Defense Public Bonds, the overseas portion will be entrusted by the Central Bank to the Hong Kong branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, or other overseas branches of the two banks, for management and payment. The Ministry has already issued a letter on October 23rd to check and act accordingly. Now, due to the fact that the redemption of principal and interest for the overseas portion will not be entrusted to other overseas branches of the Bank of China for the time being, overseas Chinese holding the above-mentioned winning bond tickets and matured interest coupons can withdraw the principal and interest according to the following methods: (1) Regarding the Gold Public Bonds, the winning bond tickets and matured interest coupons should be entrusted to the previously designated receiving banks (i.e., the Bank of China, Guangdong Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, China Revitalization Bank, and East Asia Bank) to collect the principal and interest from the Hong Kong branches of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank. (2) Regarding the National Defense Public Bonds, the winning bond tickets and matured interest coupons should be entrusted to the previously designated receiving banks (i.e., the Bank of China, Guangdong Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, China Revitalization Bank, and East Asia Bank) to collect the principal and interest from the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications. In addition to separate circulars, it is hereby notified so that you may check and handle accordingly.</p>
<h3>Merchants in the Eastern District of Shanghai Manufacture Inferior Medicines</h3>
<p>The Public Health Department of the SMC reported that the number of residents in the Eastern District is still increasing dramatically. All residential and commercial housing has been almost completely leased. Furthermore, with the increasing prosperity of the business district, the number of applications for building permits for new buildings is quite large. What is regrettable is that some merchants in that area are manufacturing low-quality food and medicines with unclear efficacy. No matter how appealing these new brands are, citizens should be cautious when purchasing them. The Health Department is paying close attention to the above-mentioned products, and after considering the situation, will give instructions separately, investigate and control, or implement confiscation to promote their improvement.</p>
<h3>Two Chinese Detectives Detained by the Japanese Have Not Yet Been Released; Actually Sent to the Shanghai West Puppet Court for Trial; The SMC is Considering Appealing to the Diplomatic Body</h3>
<p>Two Chinese detectives of the Public Concession, at noon on the 19th of this month, along with a Danish Western detective, Egerborg, and a female inspector, were searching passengers on a tram on Rue Robert when a puppet "official" claiming to be a "civil servant" refused inspection, resulting in a conflict with the police. Puppet police stationed at the intersection of Rue Robert and Rue Pére Robert fired shots at the police. Japanese military police stationed at a Japanese textile factory there arrived after hearing the gunshots and detained the four, including the Chinese detectives. After negotiations by Bowden, the Chief of Police, and Major Molander, commander of the Italian garrison, and after Danish Consul-General Scheel notified Japanese Consul-General Ayuo Iura to pay attention, Egerborg and the female inspector were released on the evening of the 19th. However, the two Chinese detectives have been detained for more than a week. Although Chief Bowden protested to Japanese Military Police Commander Miura Saburo, and the SMC protested to Japanese Consul-General Iura Ayuo on the 20th and 21st respectively, the Japanese side ignored them and did not release them. Now, further news has been obtained as follows:</p>
<p>#### Two Detectives Escorted to the Puppet Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that two Chinese detectives of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department were involved in an incident on Rue Robert on the 15th of this month while searching tram passengers, resulting in their detention by Japanese military police along with probationary Western Inspector Egerborg. They have now been transferred to a newly established "West District Court" for interrogation. According to the "New Shen Bao," the two Chinese detectives were first detained at the Japanese military headquarters on Quai du Caravanserail. After interrogation, they were deemed to have violated criminal law and were transferred to the "West Branch of the Nanshi District Court" by the Japanese authorities at 5:00 PM on Friday of last week. After a brief interrogation by the "prosecutor," the case was deemed complex, and because the injured "municipal" police officer did not appear in court, further investigation was required before prosecution could be initiated. The injured "municipal" police officer is named Yuan Mao Xin. In addition to multiple injuries all over his body, he also suffered a bullet wound to his forehead.</p>
<p>#### The Bureau Has Not Yet Taken Further Action</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that an SMC official told reporters this morning (the 27th) that regarding the detention of two Chinese detectives of the Police Department by "municipal government" police, in addition to two protests to the Japanese authorities by Chief Bowden, the SMC has not taken any further action. Whether the SMC will formally call the matter to the attention of the diplomatic body could not be confirmed today. However, it is heard that the Public Concession authorities hope that the two detectives will be released soon.</p>
<h3>Train Derailment on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line: Many Deaths and Injuries</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that according to reliable sources in the city today (the 27th), a train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line operated by the Japanese-run Central China Corporation derailed near Linping, near Hangzhou, on Sunday because the railway had been sabotaged by guerrillas. Thirty Chinese passengers were killed or injured. The guerrillas did not attack the small number of Japanese soldiers escorting the train. The extent of the damage is believed to be enormous, as traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has been cut off. It is expected that repairs will be completed today, and business will resume tomorrow (the 28th).</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th, the first train from Hangzhou to Shanghai overturned between Xianqiao and Linping due to the destruction of the tracks. This was acknowledged by a Japanese spokesperson at a news briefing last night, who said that the overturning was caused by a train derailment and denied rumors of 40 to 50 Chinese passengers being killed or injured, saying that only ten passengers were slightly injured.</p>
<h3>Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi Requests Leave Due to Illness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Wu Tingqi, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the Third Branch of the High Court, did not appear in court all day. All cases scheduled for trial yesterday were automatically postponed. Some say that Wu has requested a long leave, but according to news from the court, it is only said that Wu has temporarily requested sick leave due to illness.</p>
<h3>Lack of Subsidiary Currency Notes: Remedial Measures Have Been Devised; The Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank Cooperating; Implementation After Approval From the Central Headquarters; Five-Jiao and Two-Jiao-Five-Fen Notes to Be Exchanged As Much As Possible</h3>
<p>After the panic over the lack of subsidiary currency notes and fractional currency notes in the Shanghai market, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank to find ways to regulate the situation. A reporter from the "New Voice News Agency" learned from banking circles yesterday that the subsidiary currency notes circulating in the Shanghai market are issued by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, Zhejiang Local Bank, and others, in large quantities, which are sufficient for market circulation. The recent panic over the lack is obviously due to someone hoarding for profit.</p>
<p>#### Total Amount of Jiao Currency Issued Last Month</p>
<p>In the middle of last month, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank issued a total of 3.5 million yuan of new one-jiao and two-jiao subsidiary currency notes. Now, only a few weeks later, there is such a phenomenon of scarcity, which is completely unexpected. As for the fractional currency notes, the first batch issued was 500,000 yuan, which should have been sufficient for the market's needs for small change, but now it is also scarce, which is also unexpected.</p>
<p>#### Four Banks Together Devise Remedial Measures</p>
<p>Currently, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has cooperated with the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and other banks to devise remedial measures. In addition to the Farmers Bank of China first exchanging and circulating the five-jiao subsidiary currency notes in stock as much as possible, the remedial measures will be implemented after approval from the head office, and will be publicly announced.</p>
<p>#### Arrival of Fractional Currency Notes: Another Announcement in Shanghai</p>
<p>As for the Farmers Bank of China's daily exchange and issuance of five-jiao subsidiary currency notes, the amount is about 100,000 yuan. Because the bank's address is on Avenue Joffre, and the bank's premises are not spacious, and the number of exchangers is crowded, the exchange procedure has been moved to the Central Bank at 439 Avenue Albert beginning today (the 28th). The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 noon every day. The second batch of fractional currency notes has been contracted to be printed by the American-owned Wing On Company. After printing is completed, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank will publicly announce the issuance, so the panic over the lack of subsidiary currency notes and fractional currency notes will soon be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Amusement Program of the Citizens Group of the Refugee Association Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens Group's amusement program to raise funds for refugee cotton clothing officially opened yesterday. Yesterday's day show of mixed Shanghai opera, comic dialogue, Suzhou ballad singing, and Kunqu opera, as well as the night show of a joint performance by all the famous actors, were both sold out. Today's day and night shows are joint performances of Shanghai opera, and the night show is a joint performance by famous amateur performers. The popularity of the box office can be predicted. The association received a letter from Pan Sansheng yesterday, which said: "Dear Sirs, I was recently entrusted to donate ten 100-yuan tickets for this amusement program of your association to raise funds for refugee cotton clothing. These theater tickets have now been lost. I dare to ask you to check the ticket stubs and notify the theater immediately to stop exchanging the tickets for admission tickets. The fees can be paid by us." After the association checked, it was found that the lost tickets were A-letter honorary 100-yuan tickets No. 11 to No. 20, and the exchange has been stopped.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Announces Types of Foreign Exchange Settlements and Restricted Transit Goods; 13 Types of Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlements; More Than 10 Types of Restricted Transit Goods</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance recently announced the names of export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement and restricted transit goods, including 13 types: tung oil, pig bristles, leather, leather goods, tea, minerals, gallnuts, medicinal materials, wool, sisal, ramie, sausage casings, and feathers, all of which must be settled in foreign exchange.

<h3>The SMC Suffers Pressure From the Japanese Side to Sell Public Property; The Western Boys' School and the Chinese Public School Were Both Recently Sold to the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council's properties north of the Suzhou Creek are being forced to abandon many properties due to the restriction of their management rights by the Japanese side. Not only are they leasing various houses to the Japanese side, but now they have also sold the sites of the Western Boys' School on North Szechuan Road and the Chinese Public School on Haskell Road to the Japanese. When reporters asked the Director-General of the SMC about the scope of the abandonment of these properties, he presented a prepared statement</p>
<p>#### Statement Prepared</p>
<p>As follows: The Japanese army occupied the area north of the Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession and then restricted the SMC's administrative management in that area, making it impossible for most of the SMC's properties in the area to continue to be operated. Since the Japanese authorities requested the use of several SMC properties, the SMC allowed them to be</p>
<p>#### Temporarily Occupied</p>
<p>But rented to the relevant authorities, so the Japanese side acknowledged the SMC as the owner and paid full rent, and the lessee was responsible for maintaining the integrity of the houses and paying taxes. Most of the properties leased to the Japanese side are former school and hospital buildings north of the Suzhou Creek, because the SMC found that these schools and hospitals are now</p>
<p>#### Difficult to Operate</p>
<p>Also, the leasing of the abattoir is under consideration. The SMC previously established the Suzhou River Office, which, with the permission of the SMC, has now been converted into a Japanese hospital to care for the greatly increased number of Japanese residents. Therefore, the medical department of the Japanese Residents Association has moved into the abandoned isolation hospital of the SMC on Avenue Haig. The SMC has</p>
<p>#### Two Places</p>
<p>Completely sold to the Japanese authorities, but the SMC believes that the handling of these two properties is in the general interest of the Public Concession. The two properties are the former sites of the Western Boys' School on North Szechuan Road and the Chinese Public School on Haskell Road, whose buildings have been destroyed by gunfire.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Wenzhou Route: Successful Test Voyage; The "Hua Sheng" Telegram: Safely Arrived</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping route has been obstructed by Japanese warships for several months and has been unable to operate smoothly, but shipping companies do not hesitate to sacrifice and are not afraid of difficulties, and send ships for trial voyages from time to time. For example, on the 19th of this month, the "Yong Zhen" loaded cargo in Shanghai and sailed to Wenzhou. Unexpectedly, it was intercepted by a Japanese warship again at the mouth of the Oujiang River, and it was withdrawn to the city on the 23rd. However, according to news from the Qiacheng Shipping Company, which leases the Norwegian merchant ship "Hua Sheng" chartered by the Hua Tai Steamship Company, the "Hua Sheng" had already safely arrived in Wenzhou on Saturday (the 25th) after loading cargo in Shanghai and departing for Wenzhou that day. It is now unloading cargo, and it will return to Shanghai as soon as the return cargo is loaded. It is heard that the Qiacheng Company has recently specialized in chartering ships, and there are still many large and small Jianghai ships available for charter.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Wuhu Xian Rice Will Arrive in Shanghai for Sale; Transactions in the Rice Market Tend to Stabilize; Market Prices Are Not Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>The rising trend of rice prices in recent days, after serious expressions from various bodies and powerful people, has been slightly curbed, but has not fallen, so the panic over food rice has still not been relieved. The number of arrivals by land and water per day is six to seven thousand bags, which is comparable to the amount of food rice needed by the city's residents every day. The Wuhu xian rice, which was previously controlled by Japanese merchants, can now be freely transported to Shanghai, and a large batch of Wuhu xian rice will arrive in Shanghai for sale in the near future. Rice shops have been sluggish in their intake due to the high price of rice, while rice dealers have also been actively transporting rice due to the profitable increase in rice prices in the Shanghai market. It is expected that a large batch of domestic rice will come to Shanghai from the interior soon. The Brokers Association has been advised to stop its members from short selling and buying empty in the market after the Rice Market Management Committee resolved to prohibit brokers from speculating and artificially raising prices. It is also advising members not to engage in such bad practices in the market. Therefore, in the context of abundant arrivals, sluggish intake, and stable market transactions in the Shanghai rice market, prices will inevitably fall in the near future. The reason why rice prices have not yet fallen is that rice merchants are attempting to hoard goods purchased at high prices and are unwilling to sell at lower prices.</p>
<h3>Customs Releases National Trade Figures for the Past Three Years; After Efforts to Adjust, The State of Pre-War Recovery</h3>
<p>The customs released trade import and export figures for the past three years: (1) From January to October of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], imports were valued at 85,609,463 yuan, and exports were valued at 73,275,6914 yuan. (2) From January to October of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], imports were valued at 73,972,2005 yuan, and exports were valued at 63,600,09325 yuan. (3) From January to October of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], imports were valued at 116,140,06799 yuan, and exports were valued at 77,161,6551 yuan. This is sufficient evidence that China's foreign trade, after government adjustments, has recovered to its pre-war state, and trade has improved since September of this year, with the excess of imports over exports gradually decreasing. The elimination of the excess of imports over exports at the Shanghai Customs has been successfully achieved.</p>
<h3>Winter Clothing for the Nanshi Refugee Area: 8,000 Sets Prepared; But Not Yet Distributed</h3>
<p>The weather has been severely cold in recent days, and heavy fur coats are not warm enough. The Nanshi Refugee Area, in view of this, attaches great importance to the issue of winter protection for refugees in the area. Therefore, Gu Lun of the General Office of the Special Zone dispatched inspectors Gu Lisheng and Shen Dingguo to investigate refugees in the area who lack winter clothing. It is expected that the investigation can be completed within days, and the winter clothing will be distributed according to the list. More than 8,000 sets of clothing have been prepared for distribution. However, the General Office is concerned that unscrupulous elements among the refugees will sell them for money, so it has notified all shelters that anyone found selling the above-mentioned items in the future will be severely punished.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 postal workers and laborers of the Shanghai Postal Administration and its subordinate branch offices previously requested the postal authorities to uniformly handle the living allowance, and once stopped working shifts. The Director-General of the General Bureau, Mr. Chapellain, telegraphed the Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications for instructions and approval.

<h3>British Headquarters Prohibits British Soldiers From Going to Bars in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>The British military headquarters issued an order starting last Thursday (the 23rd), prohibiting British soldiers from staying in bars and cafes on Yu Yuan Road and Great Western Road, even if the bars and cafes are within the British defense zone. A reporter from the "Great China News Agency" learned yesterday that this new restriction was issued because four British soldiers from the East Surrey Regiment were detained for ten minutes by Japanese military police at a cafe near Jessfield Park on Yu Yuan Road on the evening of the 22nd. The incident occurred at 10:45 PM that evening when four British soldiers were returning to their barracks from a cafe. On the street, two Chinese men in plain clothes came riding bicycles. One of the British soldiers collided with a rider, and the man fell onto the sidewalk. Nearby Japanese military police immediately arrived, and because the two riders were puppet police, they detained the four British soldiers inside the cafe. After ten minutes, British military authorities arrived after hearing the news and negotiated. They then arranged a vehicle to transport the four detainees to the British barracks. In order to avoid further unfortunate incidents, the British military headquarters issued this order. In late September, an incident also occurred on Yu Yuan Road where puppet police detained American sailors. Afterwards, the US military headquarters also prohibited American soldiers from going to bars and cafes west of the Paramount Ballroom.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Weather is Extremely Cold; A Warm-Up is Expected Today; The High Pressure Has Passed Shanghai and a Warm-Up is Possible; Over Forty More People Froze to Death Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the Siberian high-pressure system pushed towards central China, the weather in Shanghai and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has become extremely cold with strong northerly winds. Around 6:00 AM yesterday, the temperature in Shanghai, according to the Xujiahui Observatory, plummeted to -4.1 degrees Celsius (the day before it was only -2.2 degrees Celsius), which is around 28 degrees Fahrenheit, making it the first extremely cold day of the winter. As a result, the ditches were frozen solid, as were water containers. Although water did not freeze instantly, breath turned into clouds. According to the observatory's forecast, the high-pressure system that struck Shanghai is now moving southeast and is expected to leave Shanghai, so the weather is expected to warm up slightly today. Due to the extreme cold, the number of boats on the Suzhou Creek suddenly decreased today, likely due to the river freezing. Many refugees and beggars froze to death, and pedestrians on the street were shivering from the cold air.</p>
<p>People Freeze to Death on the Streets: Over Forty More</p>
<p>Since the sudden cold snap the day before yesterday, over fifty homeless beggars and refugees have frozen to death on the streets within the two foreign concessions. The situation is extremely dire. Yesterday, due to the persistent cold wave, over forty more refugees and beggars, lacking warm clothing, froze to death. According to the Pushan Villa report, twenty-eight people died within the Public Concession. As of the time of this dispatch, two burial vehicles from Pushan Villa were still out collecting bodies, so the total number is likely higher. The Tongren Fuyuan Hall reported that seventeen or eighteen refugee beggars had frozen to death within the French Concession, so the total number is approximately forty-five or forty-six.</p>
<p>Investigation of Locations Where Refugees and Beggars Froze to Death</p>

<p>Hygiene for Both Sexes</p>
<h3>Ideal Treatment for Youth Sickness</h3>
<p>—Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University. The most common youth sickness is masturbation, nocturnal emission, and spermatorrhea. In addition to health preservation, the treatment should include taking the right medicine.</p>
<p>Youth sickness is often blamed on an individual's poor self-care, or being unstable and lured by lust, falling into the abyss, and taking the blame for oneself. Although young people's ignorance of health preservation or being driven by sexual desire is indeed the source of their illness, there are also cases where the fault does not lie with the young person themselves, but is caused by their parents, i.e., congenital deficiency, congenital defects, or genetic diseases.</p>
<p>There are many congenital causes, such as unhealthy parents, marrying too early, or having hereditary diseases such as syphilis, all of which are sufficient to leave behind in their children. When their children reach adolescence, they show incomplete development or defects in their sexual organs. The great concern of young people is masturbation and nocturnal emission. Although there are various inducements for their occurrence, they are also related to congenital qualities. Those who masturbate and have nocturnal emissions are often neurotic, like to be alone, and do not fit into groups, so bad habits such as the pleasure of masturbation all occur because of this predisposition.</p>
<p>There is a clear cause and effect relationship between masturbation and nocturnal emission, that is, those who masturbate will inevitably have nocturnal emissions later. Those who masturbate have very little self-control. Once sexual desire arises, they must masturbate to feel good. After the semen is released, they fall asleep lethargically. At this time, sleep is surely sound, and the semen is depleted, so there is no nocturnal emission. Once nocturnal emission occurs, they realize that the illness has already appeared, and they regret it. At this point, many people give up masturbation and correct their behavior. This is the positive side of the cause and effect of masturbation and nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>After prolonged nocturnal emission, the function of metabolism is hindered, and the brain and arms show deficiency symptoms, such as tinnitus, headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, premature ejaculation, impotence, lower back pain, and other symptoms. The most ideal treatment at this time, according to our doctors, is to first quit masturbation, clear the mind and reduce desires, do not drink excessive amounts of alcohol, do not eat sour, spicy and other irritants, and then take the German nocturnal emission special medicine "Naierse Nocturnal Emission Pills", which can stop nocturnal emission every night. Whether it is any vicious spermatorrhea or frequent nocturnal emission, three pills will take effect and one box will show results. However, because of prolonged nocturnal emission, the brain and kidneys are damaged, and there is premature ejaculation and impotence, the German endocrine agent for men, "Buti Kang", should be taken to nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate the mind within 24 hours. This is the doctor's clinical experience for a long time. The "Buti Kang" for women has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting fertility, and is most effective for breast atrophy and incomplete development.</p>

<h3>Cough and Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>—Lung Disease Expert Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Cough and tuberculosis seem to be related diseases. This statement contains a profound truth. Everyone should know that if there is a foreign object invading the lungs, it will cause an inherent reaction. The reaction is coughing. Coughing can be caused by physical stimulation or by stimulation after bacterial destruction. The former is caused by the climate, stimulated by cold air pressure, and causes a cough. The latter is caused by the destruction of lung tissue by tuberculosis bacteria. The above are only the general outlines.</p>
<p>Now that winter has arrived, the atmosphere is getting colder and the cold wind is bone-piercing. People who are generally weak and lack resistance are easily prone to coughing. If these people have no tuberculosis bacteria, the cough will stimulate the lungs and weaken their original resistance, making it easy to attract the invasion of tuberculosis bacteria. If people already have tuberculosis bacteria, then coughing is more likely to trigger the activity of tuberculosis bacteria, thus causing lung disease. From this point of view, if we suffer from a cough, we should seek medical treatment as soon as possible to avoid it turning into difficult-to-cure tuberculosis in the future. There is a popular saying: "An uncured cold turns into tuberculosis", which is indeed insightful.</p>
<p>It has become a necessary fact that coughs must be treated early. The remaining question is what kind of treatment can be effective. This question has now been resolved! Based on my experience, taking the German lung disease cough medicine "Bufei Naer" is the most effective. Patients, whether they have a cough at the beginning or a long-standing stubborn cough, can achieve the effect of relieving cough, stopping cough, and relieving asthma within three hours after taking it. It can also promote the increase of appetite. If the cough has been going on for a long time and has become lung disease, taking "Bufei Naer" can also quickly cure it. This is also a special medicine for lung disease that is unanimously recognized by lung disease experts in various countries around the world.</p>
<h3>Venereal Disease of Both Sexes</h3>
<p>—American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>We don't need to condemn patients with venereal disease with the words "morality". We are doctors, doctors who solve people's pain. We should talk about some effective and practical treatments, and we should examine the social causes of venereal disease.</p>
<p>In order to quickly eliminate the tragedy of future misfortune for both sexes, you can take the German gonorrhea special medicine "Kelin Nong". This agent is made of a mixture of protein pigment. After taking it, it can use cells to produce a great effect of anti-gonorrhea phagocytosis, so it is most appreciated by general gonorrhea patients. For all new and old leukorrhea, as long as you take "Kelin Nong", the above-mentioned effects will occur in a few hours. Thoroughly sweep away the gonorrhea bacteria scattered in the blood and other places. For men, use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and for women, use "Kaerxuedi Vaginal Tablets" as a suppository. In this way, it can be cured in three weeks during acute gonorrhea and in five weeks during the chronic period, all with radical cure effects. If married couples are both suffering from gonorrhea, they can be treated at the same time to avoid repeated infection and achieve a perfect effect. This is my practical experience for many years.</p>
<h3>Remedying Underdevelopment</h3>
<p>—German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>There is a patient named Lin Xueniang, from Changzhou, 21 years old, (self-reported): Since childhood, her body has been poor. When she was seventeen years old, she committed masturbation. She knew the harm and quit half a year later, but because she was often invaded by diseases, her bones were as thin as firewood. She often felt tired. When she was nineteen years old, she had nocturnal emissions, mostly wet dreams, about once a week, and then gradually increased, increasing to twice a week. Therefore, her body deteriorated day by day. She went to a doctor for diagnosis and treatment, who said she had lung disease. She took four bottles of cod liver oil and several doses of medicine, but it had no effect. Now her body is much worse than before. Her figure is short and her penis is only a little over an inch long. She knows that she is suffering from underdevelopment, and does not know if the doctor has any remedial methods (treatment process): I ordered her to strictly observe health preservation, take "Naierse Nocturnal Emission Pills" to stop her nocturnal emissions, and also take the German testicular essence preparation "Buti Kang" for men to nourish the loss and make her re-develop. Mr. Lin followed my words and acted. After two weeks, the nocturnal emissions were gone. After taking it for another two months, her face became plump, her food intake increased greatly, and she regained development, increasing her weight by fifteen pounds.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Forum</p>
<h3>Points to Pay Special Attention to in Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>—Written by Doctor Yao Junong</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The point to pay attention to in the radical cure of gonorrhea is whether the patient chooses a doctor and seeks medicine with precision and caution, or hastily. If a person suffers from gonorrhea, if he can get proper treatment, then the so-called persistent gonorrhea that cannot be eradicated is actually a deceptive statement. However, if you do not follow scientific methods for treatment, or do not observe health preservation, you will often truly become a difficult-to-cure disease, which is a point that must be paid special attention to. Only because gonorrhea patients mostly suffer it for the first time, and also mostly have no medical knowledge, so when they are in great pain, they inevitably take a general over-the-counter medicine with side effects to seek temporary pain relief. How can they know that these pain-relieving medicines mostly contain an anesthetic ingredient. Readers must know that the painful phenomenon when we first contract gonorrhea is a natural physiological reaction, and it cannot be effective with anesthesia. Moreover, most anesthetics reduce the patient's original resistance. This is one point. Another patient is restricted by his environment and still勉强 supports his usual work. You must know that the first health preservation condition for gonorrhea is rest. Now he is doing the opposite. How can it not harm his body? Therefore, the reason why the gonorrhea I have cured over the years is faster than others is that the patient, in addition to listening to my treatment, also accepts the health preservation methods I have instructed. As for the treatment method, among the internal medicines, the gonorrhea holy agent "Kelin Nong" is the first choice. Because the bactericidal effect of "Kelin Nong" can directly reach the lesion, surround the gonorrhea bacteria and destroy them. On one hand, the German static electricity therapy is also used to make the gonorrhea bacteria attached to the front and rear urethra have no place to stand due to static electricity.

<h3>Shanghai: A Glimpse of Talent Supply and Demand Two Years After the War (9)</h3>
<p>— Pan Wen'an, Zheng Wenhan, Shen Guanglie</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Based on the above comparative analysis, the following general conclusions can be drawn regarding the actual situation of talent supply and demand in Shanghai:</p>
<p>(1) The ratio of job opportunities to the number of job seekers has increased compared to both before the war and the first year after the war, accounting for about 10 to 8. However, the proportion of people who successfully find employment is less than one-third, which is similar to the past. The severity of unemployment has not yet decreased.</p>
<p>(2) Comparing the types of opportunities with the abilities of the talent, the former has the most opportunities in commerce, transportation technology, and crafts, while the latter has the most talent in commerce, education, and literary affairs. There are many mismatches between supply and demand, so the chances of success are also reduced.</p>
<p>(3) The number of male job seekers is about four and a half times more than female job seekers, which is a decrease from the previous year but still higher than before the war. The ratio of male to female job seekers is slightly higher than the ratio of male to female opportunities, but these slight differences do not indicate that it is easier for women to find jobs than men.</p>
<p>(4) The expected compensation of job seekers is even lower than in the previous year, but the treatment that employers are willing to offer is still lower than what job seekers expect. With the current soaring prices in Shanghai and the cost of living being several times higher, few people can maintain their lives with such low compensation, which affects job stability and work efficiency.</p>
<p>(5) The opportunities for talent demand in the inland areas are increasing daily, more than tenfold compared to the previous year, with the most demand for technical talent. The compensation is also higher than in Shanghai. Job seekers with specialized skills, if willing to endure hardship and take risks, can more easily find suitable work in the inland areas.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of talent is a major national issue. More than two years have passed since the end of the war, but there are still no concrete measures for the control and distribution of national talent, which is regrettable. The conclusion of this article that the supply and demand of talent is mismatched shows that the seriousness of this problem still exists and is likely not limited to Shanghai alone. How to investigate and statistically analyze national talent, how to properly adjust it, and how to allocate and utilize it so that everyone can use their talents and serve the country is a decisive factor for the future of the war. It is hoped that the authorities will carefully plan and seek a solution to the problem from the overall perspective. In addition, if employers can determine compensation based on work efficiency and the cost of living, and job seekers can focus on acquiring specialized skills and cultivating service ethics, the problem of talent supply and demand will be easily solved.

<h3>Finance: Exchange Rate Market Initially Tight, Then Slightly Recovers</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: The HSBC exchange rate was announced, with British gold shrinking by .25, calculated at 4.5 shillings, and the US exchange rate at .375, which was 7.3125 yuan. Other rates also declined uniformly. The gray market for British and American exchange rates was initially tight, resembling the end of last week. However, the market atmosphere was volatile and uncertain, and people were uneasy. Banks did not discuss transactions much. In the after-market, the bid and ask prices differed by as much as half a yuan. The market suddenly loosened significantly in the afternoon, due to rumors that someone would be reappointed as the Chinese Minister of Finance. After Hong Kong telegrams denied it, it softened again, so the situation was extremely chaotic. In the morning, the British rate opened and immediately decreased by .03125, and the American rate also softened by .0625. Later, because Chinese commercial banks and others began to aggressively buy, and importers had an urgent need to settle foreign cotton, the foreign banks' willingness to supply was weak, causing the situation to tighten without any recovery. In an instant, the British rate retreated to 4.75 shillings, and the American rate also tightened to 7.6875 yuan. Although it stabilized slightly later, it was still difficult to sustain due to the continued arrival of buyers, eventually reaching a tight price of 4.6875 shillings and 7.625 yuan. Fortunately, Hong Kong telegrams came to offer sales, and a portion of the Chinese commercial long positions had already reached the point of profit-taking and were eager to settle at a high price, which suddenly increased the available funds, and the market situation took a turn. Extending to the noon close, the British gold recovered to 4.78125 shillings, and the US exchange rate loosened to 7.8125 yuan. It is said that Hong Kong intermediaries were selling British and buying American, with the British-American exchange rate set at 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 1 fen, 5 li, and 6 hao. In the afternoon, due to the rumors mentioned above, buying disappeared instantly, and sellers took over. The market opened and immediately loosened, reaching 4.90625 shillings and 8.125 yuan for the American exchange rate. However, after Hong Kong telegrams stated that this news was inaccurate, people's minds changed again, and it softened back to 4.8125 shillings, and closed at 7.875 yuan. As a result, the British rate was softer than the American rate, with the British rate softer by .09375 and the American rate by .125. After the close, it was heard that it had tightened again to 4.78125 shillings and 7.8125 yuan. The trend for futures was no different from the spot market.</p>
<p>HSBC Exchange Rate Shrinks</p>
<p>In the early morning, there were no telegrams for the London large bars or the Bank of America price. The London raw gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rate between British and American rates was even, and between British and French rates was also even. The rate shrank by .125 against Shanghai, the American rate fell by half a point against British, fell .2 jiao against Shanghai, and fell by .375 against French. The central exchange rate remained the same. The bank opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 4.875 shillings and the US exchange rate at 7.9375 yuan, which was .03125 tighter for British and .0625 softer for American than last Saturday. After the opening, foreign banks' willingness to sell remained weak, while Chinese banks and speculators came to settle deals, and there was still a need to settle foreign cotton, causing the market to suddenly tighten significantly. By 9:30, the British gold had softened to 4.75 shillings, and the US exchange rate had also tightened to 7.6875 yuan. The HSBC exchange rate was announced, with British gold shrinking by .25 and the US exchange rate by .375. The silver balance tax was announced, with no increase or decrease. After that, it stabilized for a while, but soon the buying wave rose again. The softest British gold had been called at 4.6875 shillings, and the tightest American exchange rate had also been called at 7.625 yuan. Later, Hong Kong telegrams came to supply sales, and many Chinese merchants also took advantage of the high prices to exit, so the underlying trend stopped tightening and remained stable. Extending to the noon close, the British gold had recovered to 4.78125 shillings, and the US exchange rate had also loosened to 7.8125 yuan, with the British continuing to tighten by .09375 and the American rate softening by .125 compared to the morning open.</p>
<p>Selling Wave Rises Again in the After-Market</p>
<p>The after-market was initially stable, but soon rumors spread in the market that Mr. Song would be reappointed as Minister of Finance, and sellers rose in unison. Moreover, foreign banks' appetite was very weak, and the market was extremely chaotic. The most stable Chinese Chamber of Commerce sold a small amount of spot American exchange rate to a foreign bank for 8.125 yuan. The British gold had also softened to 4.90625 shillings. At that time, many December 8 yuan Chinese settlements were completed, all of which were absorbed by foreign banks. After the entry, the above news was suddenly denied by a telegram from Hong Kong, so the selling wave gradually subsided, and foreign firms such as Xinfeng and Hesheng took the opportunity to buy in, and the situation tightened again. Extending to the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was 4.8125 shillings for British gold and 7.875 yuan for the US exchange rate. The December British gold was 4.75 shillings and the US exchange rate was 7.75 yuan. As a result, the British was uniformly tightened by .09375 and the American rate was uniformly softened by .125 compared to the end of last week. It was heard that after the close, the British gold continued to tighten to 4.78125 shillings and the US exchange rate shrank to 7.8125 yuan again.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Trends Soft</p>
<p>Tianjin, 27th: The exchange market opened softly this morning, with American spot tightening by .0625 to 4 pence 1875, the US spot shrinking by .125 to 6.75 yuan, and the Shanghai exchange rate rising by 1 yuan to 117 yuan. The gray market for "Lianchao" remained unchanged, still at 88 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Shanghai Exchange Rates Rise Sharply</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 27th: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate spot slightly decreased by 1 yuan to 303 yuan, and the Japanese exchange rate spot also slightly loosened by .25 to 104.25 yuan. At 10:00 am, the Shanghai exchange rate spot sharply increased by 9 yuan to 312 yuan. At 11:30 am, it fell back by 2 yuan to 310 yuan. The market was stable. At 2:30 pm, the opening was stable and uneventful. At 3:00 pm, the Shanghai exchange rate spot continued to decrease by 3 yuan to 307 yuan.</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Notes: Rising Trend Still Fierce</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, were in high demand. The market situation was that British gold pounds were firm and slightly rising, American gold pounds were stable and unchanged, and British and American gold notes were being absorbed very smoothly, with scarce supply and sharply rising market prices. The British gold note rose to 44 yuan and 5 jiao in the morning, and the American gold note rose to 12 yuan and 8 jiao and 7 fen. In the afternoon, customers took advantage of the high prices to offer sales, and the market loosened and fell. The British gold note was 44 yuan and the American gold note was 12 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen in the evening. As a result, it was much more expensive than last Saturday. Hong Kong notes and French franc notes were also in high demand, and the market situation was firm. The Japanese gold note was uniquely soft, with the evening market at 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 6 fen, and 2 li. Korean notes had scarce supply and demand, and the market situation was stable, with the evening market still at 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 4 fen, and 5 li. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by .3 yuan, British gold notes rose by 1 yuan, American gold notes rose by .15 yuan, Hong Kong notes rose by .09 yuan, French franc notes rose by .005 yuan, and others were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Closely Following the Foreign Exchange to Transfer, Gold Shakes Unsteadily; There is a Fluctuation of 145 Yuan Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot and gray market situation for cash gold: People were bewildered, and buying and selling followed the trend, causing prices to rise and fall rapidly. From morning to night, there was a difference of 145 yuan. Initially, with the exchange market continuing to tighten and soften, the buying interest was still strong. Under competitive purchases, it initially jumped 40 yuan to 3,900 yuan, and then rose another 45 yuan. Later, when the foreign exchange stabilized somewhat, a certain gold firm and the head of the silver shops agreed to sell, and general retail investors also thought of profit-taking and exiting, so the situation changed, and the price immediately retreated to within the 3,900 yuan mark to 3,885 yuan. Then, with the exchange market showing a soft state again, securities firms and currency exchange firms entered the market to aggressively buy, and many retail investors who had sold also entered again, and the buying wave reignited. It was also heard that Hong Kong intermediaries were active, and the price soared to 3,950 yuan, the highest price of the day. By noon, the foreign exchange reported even, and buying was inferior to selling, so the noon close was only 3,925 yuan. In the afternoon, the market situation suddenly changed, and the opening fell to 3,870 yuan, because the market rumored that Song Ziwen would be reappointed as Minister of Finance, and everyone had the intention to sell, and the foreign exchange also tended to harden. Securities firms and retail investors spat out a lot. The lowest plunged to 3,805 yuan. However, the foreign exchange still tightened and softened, and the Hong Kong telegram had denied the previous rumor, and a certain currency exchange firm and the silver shops were pulling the price, rising to 3,880 yuan at the close. After the close, the foreign exchange continued to soften, and a certain silver shop pulled the price up again, reaching 3,895 yuan. Transactions were brisk, about 2,700 taels. The silver shop's jewelry gold result hung high by 5 yuan, and the customs gold remained even.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises by 20 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the game, the situation for each farmer's bar (10 taels) was tense, and the atmosphere was quite strong. Many said that exchange rates were still expected to tighten and shrink, and some were willing to offer 3,870 yuan to buy in, but the sellers waited for a good price to sell. When the exchange rate was announced at 9:00, it was reported to be soft. In an instant, the sound of buying shook the sky. At this time, the market was chaotic, and the price jumped 40 yuan at the opening. Then, a securities firm entered a certain gold firm with 30 taels for 3,900 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange continued to tighten, and the currency exchange firms' appetite for buying remained strong, it soared another 45 yuan. The currency exchange firms entered the cash gold firm with 30 taels for 3,945 yuan. Then, when the foreign exchange stabilized somewhat, and the rising momentum was inevitably sharp, it caused retail investors to exit for profit, and at the same time, a certain gold firm and the silver shops also competed to sell, and there was a lack of entrants for a while, pouring out 60 yuan. The gold firm sold 20 taels to the currency exchange firms, and the silver shops entered the currency exchange firms with 10 taels, all for 3,885 yuan. However, soon the foreign exchange suddenly reported a contraction, and the buying wave reignited. Securities firms and currency exchange firms came to aggressively absorb again, and the price immediately returned to outside the 3,900 yuan mark, and because Hong Kong intermediaries also came to search for purchases at that time, it soared by dozens of yuan again. The securities firms and currency exchange firms each entered the firms with 20 taels for 3,950 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange stopped tightening and turned flat, and the buying party's appetite weakened, and the securities firms came to replay slightly, losing 25 yuan. The currency exchange firms did 10 taels with each other, with the price set at 3,925 yuan at the noon close. In the afternoon, due to the sudden news on the market that Mr. Song would be reappointed as Minister of Finance, and the foreign exchange was quite loose at the same time, people's hearts were greatly fatigued, and a burst of shouting to sell rose. The market opened and plunged 55 yuan. The cash gold firm sold 30 taels to the securities firms for 3,870 yuan. Later, a certain currency exchange firm came to pull up the price, rising by 20 yuan at one point. A certain currency exchange firm entered the gold firm with 30 taels for 3,890 yuan. After that, securities firms and gold firms came to aggressively sell again, and retail longs saw that the situation was not good and came to cut losses, and the price plunged 85 yuan. The gold firm and the currency exchange firms jointly sold 50 taels to the gold firm for 3,805 yuan. After the entry, the previous rumor, Hong Kong, suddenly telegraphed to deny, and the exchange market also reformed to tighten and soften, so the buying wave reignited. A certain silver shop aggressively searched for purchases on behalf of customers, and securities firms also turned from selling to entering, soaring by 80 yuan. The silver shops did 20 taels with each other, and the securities firms entered the currency exchange firms with 20 taels, for 3,885 yuan. Later, another securities firm sold out, and the market was pressed down again to 3,865 yuan. At that time, the currency exchange firms aggressively absorbed more than 100 taels, and then raised the price by 15 yuan. The currency exchange firms did 20 taels with each other, with the price set at 3,880 yuan at the evening close. As a result, it rose by 20 yuan compared to the end of last week. It was heard that after the close, the foreign exchange softened again, and a certain silver shop came to pull in the price again, reaching as high as 3,895 yuan. It has risen for five consecutive days, totaling 230 yuan, with a fluctuation of 145 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold firm's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold is 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Hangs at 395 Yuan</p>
<p>The jewelry gold for each tael of silver shop, at first, Datonghang still hung at 390 yuan. At 9:35, it hung high by 5 yuan. At 2:05 pm, it went back down by 5 yuan. At 4:15 pm in the evening, it hung high again by 5 yuan. As a result, Datonghang changed to hanging at 395 yuan. The new counterparts were the same as the previous price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan to 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Once Rises, Foreign Stocks Bullish, Numerous Dividend Distributions by Foreign Firms</h3>
<p>The securities black market saw quite rapid changes in market conditions yesterday. Initially, rumors from the North and South caused a direct and indirect blow to public debt, leading to a sharp drop in market prices. However, in the afternoon, rumors spread that Mr. Song would once again head the Ministry of Finance, causing market debt to suddenly rise by one yuan. Later, as the news proved inaccurate, prices quickly fell back by half a yuan. In reality, personnel matters, based on past events, have nothing to do with public debt. Yesterday's activity saw Songmao taking the lead in selling during the initial morning session, followed by Jiufu, Lianhe, and Tongkang. Although Runli, Yichang, Dafeng, and Lianyi either covered short positions or added to their holdings, market prices showed no improvement. In the afternoon, prices slightly improved by five jiao. Due to rumors of Mr. Song's appointment, various parties took advantage of the situation to raise prices, and short sellers were quickly deceived, rushing to cover their positions. Retail investors were the most active buyers. Maotai and Fengtai also made purchases, while Tongkang, Lianhe, and Lemao sold more than they bought. Zhongfu, Sankai, Hengkang, and Tongshun sold at higher prices, securing good deals. The trend went high and then low, ultimately ending slightly better by two or three jiao, but after the market closed, prices dipped again. The total transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. A concise table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 30 shares of Ning Shao Steamship Company were traded at a price of eight yuan per share.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce opened strongly, but later, due to the tight exchange rate situation, profit-taking bulls emerged, causing the market to rapidly decline, as it has done in the past. The most favored stocks recently were also the most affected at this time. At the close, there was still no shortage of buyers, but prices were lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>The British-controlled China Rubber Company, managed by the Shanghai Huitong Foreign Firm, decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay a second interim dividend for 1939 on December 7, at 7.5 jiao per share (Editor's note: the first interim dividend was already paid at 7.5 jiao, bringing the total to 1.5 yuan).</p>
<p>The Shanghai Smidt Rubber Company, managed by the McBain Foreign Firm, decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay an interim dividend for the year ending October 1939 on December 8, at 7.5 jiao per share.</p>
<p>Both the B.L. Dodge &amp; Zimdars Rubber Companies, managed by the Xiangmao Foreign Firm, decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay a second interim dividend for 1939 on December 12, at 1.5 jiao per share each (Editor's note: the first interim dividend for both companies was also paid at 1.5 jiao each, bringing the total to 3 jiao). In addition, the Consolidate Rubber Company, managed by the same firm, also decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay a second interim dividend for 1939 on December 15, at 1 jiao per share (Editor's note: the first interim dividend was 7 fen, bringing the total to 1.7 jiao).</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Peanut Oil Surges by Over Six Yuan, Soybean Oil Spot Goods Hidden</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market saw bullish sentiment soaring amidst continued sharp declines in foreign exchange rates. No spot soybean oil was available for sale on the surface. Speculative trading of "road goods" continued, with prices rising by an additional two yuan. Specifically, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou road goods were traded (price details in the market price column), along with 100 pieces of Qingqi oil, 100 pieces of Yanqi oil, and 30 barrels of Qingdao oil. Only 10 barrels of Dalian oil were traded as spot goods. Sudden searches by Hong Kong merchants for peanut oil caused prices to skyrocket by over six yuan amidst heated sentiment. Over 1,100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 70 yuan, and 200 cans of Jiangbei listening oil were traded at 89 to 90 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Peers Rush to Buy, Domestic Cotton Jumps Six or Seven Yuan, Foreign Cotton Trends Towards Quiet</h3>
<p>Domestic cotton trading saw unusually active buying and selling among peers. This was because after the sharp reduction in exchange rates, foreign cotton prices became expensive, and the peak season for supplies from northern Jiangsu had passed. Furthermore, local village weighing prices also increased. As a result, some speculators believed that hoarding cotton was more profitable than hoarding cotton yarn. Although factories did not make wholesale purchases, peers, learning from previous situations, continued to rush to buy, causing market prices to jump by six or seven yuan. Tongzhou cotton prices had reached 148 yuan. The Xinsheng Factory purchased 500 bales of Nantong cotton, delivered to the factory gate without including water. This illustrates the prevailing market briskness. The Japanese-owned Shanghai Factory had some demand. 1,507 bales of cotton arrived in Tongzhou from northern Jiangsu, and 895 bales arrived from Beihe. The current cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>In other news, foreign cotton market prices in New York saw a decline early in the morning due to overseas telegrams reporting declines. As a result, the market appeared weak, and speculators seized the opportunity to sell. Later, spot merchants and overseas cotton merchants also sold in the market, and bulls took profits. Closing prices fell by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by eight rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by over twenty pounds. Liverpool rose by ten pence.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has recently become quiet again. Chinese factories made some purchases at low prices during the previous period, and this raw cotton is already en route and will arrive in port successively next month. Therefore, there is no immediate concern about shortages, and buying interest is unusually weak. Industry peers' purchases of raw cotton are also unusually weak. The Japanese side is also very quiet. The market value of U.S. cotton yesterday, converted to the factory price using an exchange rate of 7.875 USD, is as follows:</p>
<p>20 count American middling: 179.35</p>
<p>Also, lower grade: 172.55</p>
<p>32 count: 186.10</p>
<p>Also, lower grade: 177.65</p>
<p>42 count: 189.50</p>
<p>Also, lower grade: 179.35</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Dollar Rises, Hong Kong Sales of Cotton Yarn See Renewed Activity</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued its advance, with the rising trend intensifying again. This was due to the narrowing of the black market exchange rate, which boosted confidence. Speculators' sentiments turned bullish, and they rushed to buy in the market, causing the cotton surface to slightly firm. At the same time, raw cotton was affected by exchange rates, and foreign cotton settlement prices became higher, causing the market to expand further. As for actual sales, although there was no large-scale development, the Hong Kong dollar rose in value, making it more cost-effective for Hong Kong merchants to purchase goods. Therefore, retail business was somewhat more active than in the past. The closing price for 20 count Shuangma (Double Horse) was 667 to 678 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning with unanimous optimism. Due to positive news and the continued strength of foreign exchange rates, a buying spree erupted. The opening price was 673 yuan, and then it gradually rose, reaching 681 yuan in an instant. Shortly after, a certain firm released some holdings, causing a sudden drop of 9 yuan to 672 yuan. Then, with rumors of a large jump in cotton prices and a further narrowing of exchange rates, prices rose again. The half-day transaction volume totaled 1,955 bales. The price of 20 count Shuangma (Double Horse) rose by 14 yuan, Shuangqiu (Double Globe) rose by 13 yuan, and Tiannv (Heavenly Woman) rose by 10 yuan. Chongxin Factory offered 225 bales of 20 count Dafa (Great Prosperity) at a price of 655 yuan. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Peers: 1,145 bales. Hong Kong: 495 bales. Xiamen: 30 bales.</p>
<p>Ningbo: 70 bales. Yunnan: 80 bales. Hunan: 40 bales.</p>
<p>Inland: 50 bales. Jiangxi: 45 bales. Total: 1,955 bales.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Surge by One Yuan</h3>
<p>In the miscellaneous grains market, one factor was the gradual rise in oil prices, which inevitably affected sentiment. The second factor was the tight foreign exchange situation and the rising price of gold, which fueled the appetite of hoarders. Soybeans took the lead in surging, starting to stir on Sunday and rising by over one yuan in just two days. Specifically, 300 bags of Nanjing beans were traded at 14 to 14.3 yuan, 200 bags of Wuhu beans at 14.3 to 14.4 yuan, 130 bags of Anqing beans at 14.5 yuan, 260 bags of Liao Jia Zhou beans at 15 yuan, over 400 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow beans at 15.2 to 14.65 yuan, and 60 bags of Pudong Du beans at 15.4 yuan. Other grains followed suit, mostly rising by three to four jiao compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a further narrowing of foreign exchange rates, with the Dutch exchange rate at 13.625. The trend tightened again. The Guild set prices: spot 24 coarse white, local warehouse at 54 yuan, up one yuan; foreign warehouse old goods also at 54 yuan, newly arrived at 54.3 to 54.4 yuan, direct delivery at 56 jiao, up 1.3 to 1.4 yuan; transshipment goods at 43 to 43.5 yuan, up one jiao.

The Guangzhou group offered forty-odd bags of Huizhou foreign goods at 45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Kailuan Coal Sales Suddenly Flourish</h3>
<p>The bituminous coal business has seen a sudden surge in sales recently due to the opening of waterways. Market transactions have reached over tons per day, especially for mid-grade goods. Industry peers' quoted prices: Kailuan No. 1 lump, 82 yuan per ton; Kailuan No. 2 lump, 74 yuan; No. 1 dross, 70 yuan; No. 2 dross, 62 yuan; Keelung dross, 58 yuan. Shipments from industry peers' warehouses to customers are subject to an additional commission.</p>
<h3>Grain: "If There is a Famine Village, Remember the Heroes' Determination": Rice and Grain Will Never be Manipulated. Truly, to Stabilize Grain Prices and Prevent Manipulation, Only Abundant Supply at the Source and Effective Management Will Suffice</h3>
<p>After a brief downturn the day before yesterday, japonica rice was once again manipulated by speculators yesterday, seeing a rebound. Hoarders, in order to maintain their expensive goods and avoid losses, did not hesitate to collect at high prices again, creating a good opportunity for traveling merchants to continue raising prices. Local shopkeepers, seeing that the market was not easily softening, also had good intentions. Inland groups, seeing the activity of local sales, followed suit to purchase, and the situation quickly became sensational. Amidst each price step by step shouting high, fortunately, the arrival to the source is continuous, yesterday also arrived Sutung gang sixteen cars, and Qingsi, Kuntai, Fengjia and other goods twenty-odd cars, and from Baimao port transported to Changyi Road area of two thousand-odd bags, to the end a prosperous, manipulators since powerless, however, the results such as thin rice price with a weak skeleton, not easy to hold for a long time, still a fixed conclusion. Japonica tip prices increased by six or seven jiao and half yuan or so. The total market transaction volume was seven to eight thousand bags.</p>
<p>The customer indica was once again purchased smoothly yesterday morning, and the hoarding stomach was increasingly active, so the opening price immediately saw an increase of six or seven jiao or more. Traveling because of the source of Hong Kong foreign rice, and Jiangbei indica and other have also been transported in batches to the port, combined there are five thousand bags or so, can be transferred to the warehouse and sample tomorrow, so the market's heart returned to stability, the price was slightly depressed, high customer indica thirty-three yuan and a half, still more expensive than four or five jiao cloud.</p>
<p>Foreign rice, due to the uncertain exchange rate, hopes for setting goods are lost, yesterday because gold rose hoarding greed, the market atmosphere particularly lively, Annam japonica thirty-four yuan and a half, Saigon thirty-four yuan to thirty-three yuan, better than the previous market half yuan Xu, yesterday also Luo Lai rice two ten thousand and six hundred and fifty-eight bags.</p>
<p>Rice prices when a new product is released, wildly raise and fiercely increase, and there is an increase of four or five yuan in one day, that is, specializing in speculative markets buying short and selling short such as securities yarn flower markets should also be in the list of stop boards, but rice and grain still have more physical trading, requires large-scale capital to manipulate, not as good as the exchange only chasing certificates, so its courage is indeed greater than other speculations, but also no matter who, are deeply disgusted its behavior, but rice and grain so for people to manipulate, also no more than the use of incoming goods are subject to restrictions, (this is restricted reasons more than one end) supply and demand is not easy to balance, and the capital on the road to help, to say the way to stop rice merchants manipulate, there are political, economic, and still passive coping, that is, such as rice merchants manipulate, the public consumers can directly United to the rice-producing area trade rice, not only rice merchants no business to do, that is, peddlers will also not be forbidden and self-destruct, manipulation history no way to talk about, but from what united, to purchase, to distribute, in order to combine to stare at foreign rice, there are still many difficulties, not to mention such a complex thing, if entrusted to disguised merchants to do, can guarantee its gradually does not occur as before the disadvantages, as to obstruct export, all kinds of difficulties, and exorbitant taxes, all belonging to the bloody-minded, no one does not gnash their teeth, can get rid of, no one does not wish, there is still a kind of boycott approach, that is, no matter which side, all those who strike at the people's food, that is, implement the boycott action, do not go to buy food, or change to eat foreign rice, or change to eat flour wheat, flour wheat such as also being manipulated, rather eat foreign flour wheat, foreign rice flour wheat such as a time is not easy to get, rather can hunger, hunger to the extreme, rather and "Famine Village Remember" the gentlemen to embrace the same determination, so that the grain merchants' goods, no one to pay attention, the trick of being manipulated, not poor eyesight, and also make foreign news agencies in the future will no longer mislead the intention to increase the manipulation opportunities for grain merchants news to China, or even find ways to impose a blockade, in Japan last year's closed book it is said that no rice and grain imports (?), In this year, there is a saying of importing foreign rice, but I hope that it is not a fact even if it is a fact, after this "Waste Rice Day" movement, or make this year or next year's Japanese closed book can have no foreign rice import record, that is, there are foreign rice imports, to be from Saigon Lan and other places, in this way, is really the happiness of the Chinese people's food, and do not like the previous years rice and grain only to Yanqing Tianjin and other places to transport, in the end is not on-site consumption, until now is a question, in addition to wanting rice prices to fall, only to the source of prosperity, supply and demand matching, or supply over demand, or management is effective, or regulation is moderate, in various situations combined and care, find a more feasible approach.</p>
<h3>Spot Flour Factory Offer Open, Seven Yuan Five Jiao Cash, Fuxin Will Stop Cars Open</h3>

<h3>Literature and Art and Life</h3>
<p>— Wen Ge</p>
<p>A blind man touching an elephant's tail said that the elephant was smaller than a mouse. This uses a part to determine the whole, which is naturally wrong. The view of life is the same; although it is an abstract thing, there is also a distinction between part and whole. A true view of life: cannot use part to determine the whole but should use the whole to determine the part. But although the part is unified in the whole, it is also contradictory. If we ignore its contradiction and exaggerate its unity, then the story of the blind man determining the elephant with the tail is an example.</p>
<p>Many people say that literary works aim to reflect real life, which is an iron fact. We can refine life and expand our world view. But here, we must pay attention to the relationship between part and whole. If we do not pay attention, we will inevitably distort the view of life, making the part overly expanded, but making the whole blurred.</p>
<p>For example, in the case of Andreyev, he saw a lot of the ugliness of life. So in his works, there is only a mournful moan of despair for life. In fact, although life has a broad dark side, it is not entirely so. There is also a bright side that stands in opposition.</p>
<p>As for Chekhov, another pessimistic writer, he is slightly different from Andreyev. He is a man who deeply understands human nature and weaknesses, so he also expresses an irreparable sadness for life. However, he is not as completely despairing as Andreyev. In the gloom, he still hopes that the distant future will be better. However, the air of doubt in this hope is too strong, so the real light is still quite far from him.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, what these two writers see of life and the world cannot be considered wrong. Unfortunately, they are too attached to the part, so that for the whole, they cannot see clearly, like looking at flowers in the fog. The conclusion, of course, becomes a problem.</p>
<p>In fact, there is nothing in the universe that is forever unchanging, and the same is true of darkness and light. If we do not express despair for life, then even if everything around is dark, we do not need to be afraid or anything. As long as you can work hard and fight against it tirelessly, the light will always come one day. It is true that sometimes we may inevitably be sacrificed in fierce battles, but it is also good to be able to provide convenience for those who come later. So for Chekhov and Andreyev, I always feel infinitely regretful.</p>
<p>Here, it makes me think of Gorky, who is very different from them. He understands that the world has a dark side. But he does not express pessimism. On the contrary, he uses a more tenacious force to find the root of the darkness and break it. He once said, "We cannot but live in this life. We must recognize it. We must transform it." How correct these words are! They pierce the hearts of pessimists sharply!</p>
<p>Literary works have a great influence on people's thoughts. Of course, the world view presented must also be very accurate. Otherwise, there will inevitably be many people with weak wills who will be confused, resulting in a painful tragedy. What is the point of this? So, for every writer, I think they should objectively and wholly point out the world view.</p>
<h3>Sally</h3>
<p>— Xu Ye</p>
<p>The flowing water of the Volga River flows day and night, the source of this water is in the Valdai Hills. On the riverbank, there are boatmen with heroic songs morning and evening. This free port, which was once completed with the blood of millions of iron palms, is given the name: Great Russia's River of Blood.</p>
<p>In winter, the sound of the river is even more furiously agitated. Dazzling snowflakes spread evenly on the sandy plain, and not far away you can hear the sounds of the shepherdess and the sheep breathing, what a delightful atmosphere unfolding around the river.</p>
<p>Waterbirds skimming the surface of the waves, they flock to the windmills in the village, and after the snow, the moorland pansies exude an intoxicating fragrance, and the October sun kisses the vast mountains and river embankments. Beneath the green clouds, the river stretches out red waves, and the heroic roar of the waves is worth the love and praise of men and women growing up in a free country...</p>
<p>Here, I met Sally. She takes care of ten sheep, but she loves the roaring waves of the Volga, and she always brings the sheep here every day.</p>
<p>"Good morning!"</p>
<p>Sally is a courageous child.</p>
<p>"Tell me the story of the Volga again!"</p>
<p>The setting sun links a line of bright rays of light, the sound of animals' footsteps blows up from the pine forest, the shadows of travelers are reflected on the rapids of the river, the pasture at dusk slowly becomes quiet, the cold current loses its old attitude, and the arrival of the night feels extraordinarily gloomy.</p>
<p>"Would you like to breathe the wind of the quiet night?"</p>
<p>I look at her intently, and Sally smiles as she looks at the feathered shadows in the clouds.</p>
<p>Leaving the riverbank, her pace is very slow, the sheep accompany this traveler in the sandy plain, and Sally's amber-like eyes still stare at a vast starry sky.</p>
<p>"It's a thing of the past: the blood of our ancestors was spilled all over this river, there were such amazing days: the sufferers under the iron prison began a heroic action, for which we wanted freedom and sunshine!"</p>
<p>Sally spoke and sang: "I love the sun of the motherland, its dazzling brilliance! We forever sing on the bright earth, building the bright castle with solid strength..."</p>
<p>I am unusually moved.</p>
<p>"I hope I can have a day to shed blood!"</p>
<p>She laughed and clapped her hands at me.</p>
<p>In the night sky, under the moonlight, Sally shouted at the sheep and left. The coolness of the moorland was very strong. I looked at the few lights in the village from afar...</p>
<p>"We'll see you tomorrow!" The loud voice echoed in the high air.</p>
<p>The tide of blood涌着chest, in the confusing摸案中I woke up: 　视着future, silent 　念now adding greater courage, although there is no reed flute to harmonize with Sally's heroic song. For her, I will use battle to answer the call of the motherland!</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>At dawn, Sally came again.</p>
<p>"Remember: bright red exotic flowers will bloom in the sandy plain. Soon I will give you a pair of straw shoes. There are blood stains that I have shed!"</p>
<p>Looking up, eagles are chasing the　　white clouds, and the Volga River is surging again...</p>
<p>Oh! I have a source of endless life!</p>
<h3>"Believing in Beauty Is Not My Land"</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>These past few days, every morning, I can often see florists on the street, carrying chrysanthemums of various colors and patterns. So fashionable halls and rooms often have chrysanthemum embellishments.</p>
<p>But I often have two kinds of musings about these chrysanthemums: chrysanthemums standing in magnificent halls will not be more beautiful.</p>
<p>Sure enough, my musings were not wrong. One day, I went to a certain restaurant to eat the wedding banquet of relatives, the ceremony hall was decorated very beautifully, and the guests were full of joy. Everyone was in high spirits, simply wanting to make a commotion until late at night. There were also a few pots of chrysanthemums in this ceremony hall, but they were all drooping like they were depressed, not as bright as the ones I saw in the morning at the florist's stall. The leaves were dry and the flowers were curled up. People will go to the middle of the night, I see the spirit is still each glowing, guessing punches and drinking wine, squeezing to see the bride, talking about business and making money, there is still not one that has some haggard appearance. Then why would the chrysanthemums be like this? It was originally standing in a pot, and there was soil in the pot. Although there was less, it would not be insufficient to supply its daily needs! That's right, I think chrysanthemums standing in magnificent ceremony halls will not be more beautiful.</p>
<p>With this experience, every time I pass in front of a restaurant, I pay more attention to the cypress and the like placed in front of their doors, which are indeed always so green and lovely. There are often a few pots of mixed flowers on the terrace of the house across from me, and I have never seen them withered or haggard, although sometimes they encounter strong winds and heavy rains, the flowers and leaves may fall a little, but the flower branches are still standing upright, with no sign of decline.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are originally famous for being proud of the frost, as Su Dongpo said, "The lotus has exhausted and there is no umbrella to hold the rain, and the chrysanthemum remains with branches proud of the frost." Even if it is being pressed by the cold frost, it is still blooming brightly. It basically does not want comfort, it wants to struggle with the environment, so it does not want to take advantage of spring and summer to compete with the various flowers for beauty. It must wait until after the sisters have already silenced and disappeared before it slowly spits out its unique beauty. Its aloofness is certainly admirable, and its fearlessness of oppression and independent struggle can make people infinitely admire it. Because its nature is like this, so what comfortable and magnificent halls and rooms, it is in fact repulsive to it.</p>
<p>If chrysanthemums were really like people, I think it would definitely announce people's sins, and it would shout even more, "Believing in beauty is not my land," and leave the halls and still go to struggle arduously with the storm.</p>
<h3>Compilation of "Frontier Songs" (Book Review)</h3>
<p>— Ruo Hong</p>
<p>Music possesses a great and moving power. A song of gentle affection, pleasing to the ear, can evoke boundless reverie; a heroic and stirring melody can cause the blood to boil. Since the War of Resistance, it has become even more evident that music and song not only manipulate individual emotions, but also grasp the soul of the entire nation. Its power cannot be extinguished, and countless singing groups have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain. This lies precisely in this fact. In the rear areas, singing is used to connect with the simple people and to educate the ignorant. It has reaped the effects of propaganda and improved the level of knowledge. On the front lines, many comrades have been inspired by singing and strengthened their courage. At this time, our country's music has entered a new stage. It has contributed its greatest strength to the War of Resistance, it has encouraged much public morale, and it has also recorded many touching and praiseworthy historical events.</p>
<p>Shanghai had a period of extreme fervor. Almost every program on the radio stations broadcasted songs of national salvation, and every corner resonated with exciting songs. However, as the armies retreated westward, everything fell into silence due to the special circumstances. All that could be heard were the "songs of national subjugation" that had been banned in earlier years. Since then, few pieces with any meaning have been seen.</p>
<p>By chance, in a small bookstore, I obtained a small booklet, which was "Frontier Songs," a recent work by the young composer Lao Xin. It is thin, only twenty-four pages, containing twenty-three new songs, divided into four parts. The lyrics are subtly powerful, but the simplicity does not diminish the connotation of the words and music. The songs are all easy to sing, especially the songs in "Compilation of Little Mosquitoes," which are especially suitable for singing materials for junior high and elementary school students. The musical scores are all in optimistic, cheerful, resolute, and passionate tones, full of confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance. "We have a common ideal, we have a common belief, advancing toward a common goal, our will is as strong as steel." These are the lyrics of the Graduation Song of Thousands of Li. What will the masses who love singing think when they see them?</p>
<h3>Facing Life</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of fate playing tricks on you, just wipe away the dejected tears; like a piece of iron, the occasional rust on the outside cannot conceal the hardness in its core.</p>
<p>No matter how tightly the pain of words presses, take a breath, clench your fist, grit your teeth, every hope must be arranged by yourself, breaking through the persecution that fills the world.</p>
<p>The past was a period of rotten time, why should the living cling to skeletons? A guaranteed future lies before you, step into the dilapidated present.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is also a lingering, undying love—who dares to guarantee it for you in these times? The world originally had a bright and beautiful flower bud, but unfortunately it was destroyed yesterday.</p>
<p>Life is the crucible of the times, the crucible does not allow you any hesitation; a burst of boiling—a flash of light, dull steel is refined from a pile of rusty iron.</p>

<h3>Kun Opera Advocates Good and Punishes Evil—Beneficial to Worldly Morality and People's Hearts</h3>
<p>— Shi Yiren</p>
<p>The way of sound is the most deeply moving, its transitions and shifts are invariably related to the rise and fall of world affairs. During the Ming Dynasty, Liang Bolong, Wei Liangfu, Zhang Xiaoquan, Ji Jingpo, and their like, were able to harmonize sounds and transform tones like gossamer, creating Kunqu opera. At that time, "The Red Pear Record" and "The Swallow Letter" were popular in the old capital. By the early Qing Dynasty, men of letters and poets competed to write legends and also compose scripts. "A Handful of Snow," "A Thousand Zhong of Fortune," and "Iron Crown Map," and others, propagated loyalty and righteousness, and their noble spirit soared to the skies; while "Emerald Garden," "Fisherman's Joy," "A Penny," and "The Gorgeous Cloud Pavilion," and other plays, all contained the intention of promoting good deeds, which could make the people's customs honest and upright. By the mid-Qianlong period, there was no alley in the marketplace that did not have someone who could sing the melodies; but today, the morale of the scholars is declining, weeds are everywhere, loyalty, righteousness, and morality have vanished; the music of the law has been destroyed, the upright spirit has disappeared, and the new plays compiled by actors all focus on romantic affairs in boudoirs, or show off novelty and compete for skill, supplemented by scenery, without considering whether the times are in harmony with the scenery. The audience rarely has the ability to judge, and they are only amused and pleased by the songs and banners for a time. However, as society declines, and human relations and customs become increasingly depraved, how can one find the correct standards and norms?</p>
<p>"The Water Margin Record," "Capturing Alive with Tea Borrowed," writes about Zhang Sanlang seducing a woman to the point of mutual destruction; "Qin Pick and Joyful Poem" originally belongs to a scholar living alone without company, and when he meets a wonderful nun, it is like a magnet attracting a needle, but he does not forget his ambition for fame, and eventually achieves success and returns, and then they unite as husband and wife. It is similar to "Romance of the West Chamber" in different ways; "Luo Meng" advises people not to be greedy for money; "Forced Divorce in a Fool's Dream" warns women to be chaste and patient, and not to be fickle. "White Gauze Shirt" tells of the evil retribution of bandits, and that a good wife, a righteous husband, and a filial son will have a day of reunion. Others, such as the wise wife of "Pipa Ji" reuniting, and the filial piety of "Jingchai Ji" being rewarded generously, all have a great impact on the hearts of the audience, so I say that if people's hearts can tend toward Kun Opera, abandon frivolity, and embark on the right path, the world will be able to enjoy prosperity. In the past, compiling and creating plays took a lot of effort, and they were corrected several times before they could be published and circulate in the world, and they were made with purpose. Even the legend "The Palace of Eternal Life" written by Hong Sheng of Qiantang took more than ten years of effort and was revised three times before it was completed, so it should be able to be passed down to future generations. The licentious atmosphere in Shanghai was extremely prevalent for a time, and gentlemen of great refinement should make corrections, how can they abandon the fundamentals and pursue the trivial?</p>
<h3>Hollywood Movie News</h3>
<p>— Fang Mu</p>
<p>Loretta Young and David Niven are very good friends, and their friendship has been going on for more than five years. She helped him engage in camera work, and they can be said to have like-minded goals and matching drums. Now they are working together in a film called "Eternally Yours," which adopts a universally pleasing theme, full of light and joy. Their advantages are all brought into full play.</p>
<p>No one dares to say that Hollywood directors and screenwriters are not opportunists. An interesting joke was made during the filming of "The Housekeeper's Daughter." Originally: There was a scene shot on location on the streets of New York with a violent fight and arson, the scene was realistic and lively enough. But as a result, someone called to report to the police that there was trouble on the street, and it was turned upside down! The bureau received the report and sent a large number of police, navy, and fire trucks, marching mightily to the scene of the incident. As a result, the scene was made even more tense, but it was all filmed by the producers. Naturally, there was no need for another N, G, and the adventurous parties had a very good harvest as a result.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War this time, the people of Europe have been very depressed and need some comfort and stimulation! In the entertainment circles of Britain and France, naturally, performances of tragedies are not welcome, and light comedies are generally used instead, which will bring smiles to the audience and temporarily forget their worries.</p>
<p>Regarding movies, the American Artists Association sent four suitable films for the same good. The four types are: 1. "Intermezzo" starring Leslie Howard 2. "Eternally Yours" by Loretta Young 3. "The Housekeeper's Daughter" by Joan Bennett 4. "A Chump at Oxford" by Laurel and Hardy.</p>
<h3>A Scene from Mr. Wang and Three Tenants</h3>
<p>(Produced by Hua Xin Company, Screening at Xin Guang)</p>
<p>New Work Introduction</p>
<h3>The Toy Wife</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Louise Rainer's acting skills, starting from "The Great Ziegfeld," have received the highest praise for any work, her profound inner performance, Hollywood does not seem to have an actress who can rival her. Louise Rainer in "The Toy Wife" plays a wayward, active girl who even regards marriage as child's play. From when her father takes her sisters back to the New Orleans plantation, she meets George, her sister Louise's childhood lover; she socializes with Andre; the years after marriage; Louise's jealousy of managing the household; her elopement with Andre; and finally, lying sick in a hostel, begging Louise to marry George before her death and raise her beloved son, Louise Rainer fully sculpted a "Toy Wife" as envisioned by the playwright.</p>
<p>Director Subi also devoted his full efforts to assist Louise Rainer in sculpting, so in his delicate and moving paintings, we only feel that there are many scenes that are not fully developed, rather than the drawbacks of being tedious. For example, the love process between Gilbert and George; and the desolate scene after eloping with Andre, etc., are not fully depicted, so the following examples all show the director's meticulousness. (1) Louise comes down the stairs and sees George coming out of her father's room. She just wants to turn back, but George stops her, but George tells her that he loves Gilbert. After Louise blesses them, when they kiss, a cutaway shot shows Andre just seeing this sad scene at the door. (2) George and Andre duel, the director only writes about Gilbert getting out of the carriage and hearing two loud bangs, she covers her face and weeps. (3) Louise asks George to go to the hostel to see Gilbert, George waits below, but finally moves upstairs. Other depictions of sisterly affection are also very lovely.</p>
<p>Melvyn Douglas's George is very moving as he witnesses his wife's neglect of the household and asks Louise to come home to preside over the household, he cannot bear to blame his beloved wife and is grateful for Louise's kindness. Beulah Bondi's Louise sacrifices her own happiness and always thinks of her sister, and her performance is also very moving.</p>
<h3>Guohua Intelligence</h3>
<p>— Chun Guang</p>
<p>Guohua's costume film "Hero in Troubled Times", as the name suggests, is known to be a big film. It is now more than half completed. The male leads are Shu Shi, Bai Yun, Zheng Zhong, You Guangzhao, and Zhou Qi. The female leads are Zhou Manhua, Chen Jingfang, Xu Tianren, and Meng Na. The lineup is very strong and the capital is also huge.</p>
<p>Another costume work "Dong Xiaowan" is in preparation, and the protagonist is Zhou Xuan. She came to the company the other day to try on new costumes.</p>
<p>Wu Cun's new work is "The Amorous History of Su San", and he has been busy planning the scenery, costumes and selecting actors these days.</p>
<p>In addition to filming, the actors have also been rushing to rehearse the Peking opera "Killing Home While Fishing" and the drama, preparing to show their talents in the Shanghai Refugee Association charity show on the Xinxin stage.</p>
<h3>Reporter on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Paul</p>
<p>This film tells the story of a famous reporter in the American press, Stanley, who was employed by the New York Herald and was sent to Africa to find a missing expert missionary Livingston. As a result, he finally found Livingston due to his unremitting efforts. It caused a sensation in the United States and was enough to encourage people to have a spirit of courage, perseverance, and indomitable will. Spencer Tracy plays Stanley. The whole film is great and compact. The Daguanming will be released next time. The left image is one of the tense scenes in the film. It is the latest woodcut.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The North and South each have a worship</p>
<p>Who knew that Old Rui's eyes were dim and he didn't see it, he still straightened his waist and walked straight forward. At this time, the doctor froze there, unable to sit down or stand. At the same time, all the male and female guests in the ballroom focused their eyes on Mei's side, and the dancers sitting beside him felt even more embarrassed. I couldn't bear to look at it from the opposite side, so I quickly stood up, caught up with Old Rui, and announced "Boss Mei is saying hello to you." He hurriedly turned back, took off his hat and politely returned the salute to Lanfang, exchanged a few words of greetings, and then I accompanied him out together. Often there are many people who don't know Debao, wondering what kind of person he is with that bald head and chubby body. Why is Dr. Mei so respectful to him? In fact, when Old Rui sang eight volumes of "Hun Yuan Box" in the past, he played the protagonist Zhang Tianshi. The insignificant mussel spirit who played with him was the famous Dr. Mei today. Mei can respect the predecessors of the Pear Garden. It is the greatest reason for his success. Other children's ability, and status are far worse than Mei's in every way, but the arrogance of those people is a hundred times faster than Lanfang. Therefore, I say that today's drama is really reluctant to watch. Even the younger actors visiting guests, I am also reluctant to talk to them. (150)</p>
