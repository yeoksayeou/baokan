<h3 id="c11">第三國際與莫洛托夫之表示 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>今日之俄羅斯社會主義聯邦蘇維埃共和國，肇造於一九一七年俄歷十月間；昨日為廿二週年紀念日，蘇聯於年年是日，舉行一年一度之盛典。廿二年前，第一决世界大戰方酣，俄羅斯為當時參戰國家之一；列甯之徒，以革命姿態，內則領導農工，剷除舊制，外則捐棄與國，退出戰塲；蓋彼主義之感召既超越政權改組之意味，而國際之環境復容許彼以自力更生，建設獨立國家。此以歷史觀察，實逢絕好機會；然檢討其本質，實由對內對外之絕不妥協，憑藉大衆為力量，把握主義為魂靈，始得蔚為蘇聯新生命之源泉，初非以機會倖致者也。</p>
<p>此次紀念日之前夕，莫斯科之黨國當局，各有躊躇志滿之表示；强盛之國，國慶之時，况復身居戰爭漩渦之外，動為國際重輕所繫，趾高氣揚，宜也。其中允可注意者：一，以第三國際執行委員會之名義，發表告全世界工人曁無產階級書；二，由蘇聯人民委員會主席兼外交委員長莫洛托夫氏演說國內外一般大勢。第三國際之文告，至記者執筆時為止，尙未獲讀全文；據路透哈瓦斯二社莫斯科電所傳，則知於宣揚共產主義之外，對於資本主義各國抨擊不遺餘力；對於作戰歐洲之英法德諸國視為一邱之貉，徒以利害矛盾而相斫，於英法允不諒；對於遠東則指斥日本為帝國主義之侵略者，蹂躪中國，已逾兩載，中國迄今為獨立而奮鬥，用是昭告世界勞工，聯合一致，共謀保衛中國。原第三國際與蘇聯政府，二者各有其體系，各有其形態，各有其活動之領域；然其間相互之化合運用，則撲朔迷離，微妙之甚，謂二而一，謂一而二，似是矣，皆非也。　大體言之：蘇聯政策要必不離第三國際之經緯，然二者又不必盡同其時間空間。今第三國際為中國抵抗所謂「帝國主義之侵略者」而向世界勞工作正義之呼籲，此與切實策動有效之作為，具有相當遼闊之距離；然在中國方面，既在艱苦抗戰之中，得此溫情之慰藉，復在國際縱橫之中，獲知蘇聯政策必將與第三國際所宣示者不相牴牾，是必為之忻然。</p>
<p>至於莫洛托夫氏之演說，讀者値得破費功夫，竟讀全文。彼之理論，吾人不盡折服；彼所攻訐，吾人不盡同情；彼所辯護，吾人不盡懷疑；然彼固社會主義者領袖之一而蘇聯政府之負責當局也，蘇聯半年來之外交，彼允負正面責任，今盛稱社會主義與愛國情緒之融化，謂『蘇聯愛國主義已有鞏固之基礎，』又謂『此種愛國主義已深入蘇聯紅軍及人民之腦海中；』則易地而處，以愛國為出發點而發為此類攻訐與辯護，則誰復不諒？凡所云云，自應以其為愛國情緒中之蘇聯當局而分別觀之，</p>
<p>中國以三民主義立國，而民生主義實居資本主義與社會主義之中庸；中國所爭在獨立自由之保持，方為反帝國主義而抗戰；今莫氏演說，度長絜短於社會主義與資本主義之間，復指摘帝國主義者之罪行，中國非其演說之對象也。然有甚可發人深省，未可以其為社會主義信徒而以人廢言者：莫氏稱資本主義之舊世界，既因衰老腐朽而漸趨落沒；夫終於落沒與吾，衰老腐朽之不可藥石與吾，是皆莫大問題，然衰老腐朽之徵，不可諱飾。國際不尙信義，不重公道，行止與信仰相矛盾，為小利近利而茍安，放任國際共通原則與秩序之被暴力所破壞，此所以徵衰老腐朽之允著者也。此而不能急起直追，力謀糾正，則不但誹笑自有由來，落沒自有可能，抑且為創痛深鉅者所欲加之以詛咒矣。莫氏謂「歐亞兩洲戰爭之結束，遙遙無期，緣帝國主義國家業已喪其自力改進內部之自信，而惟侵略是務；」又作論斷，以示其對於帝國主義列强之絕望，且更期以成為「國際新屠殺；」凡此所論，自是社會主義者冷酷之音容，然彼務侵略，務屠殺者，謂不應反躬自省其弱點，自懺其罪行乎？不能自省，不能自懺，徒張反共之幟，是將無殊於為獺為鸇，為桀與紂也，於共何損乎！</p>

<p>「十月革命使吾國脫離了資本主義社會、自彼以後、地球上發生兩個世界、共一爲包括一切資本主義國家及其統治下殖民地與半殖民地的資本主義舊世界、其二爲吾蘇維埃國家創造的社會主義新世界、衰老腐朽的資本主義業已將就末日、而十月革命產生的新世界則日益健强、漸漸出人頭地、但資本主義雖日趨衰落、其性質則頗頑强、現方盡其所能以圖茍延殘喘、</p>
<p>「資本主義在吾人時代、對于人民毫無貢獻、所有者惟爲不斷的經濟恐慌、城市的普遍失業、鄕村的飢荒災亂、對于億兆殖民地人民的加緊壓迫、以及殘酷無盡的屠殺與戰爭、一九二九年至一九三三年間、資本主義各國曾經歷極嚴重的經濟恐慌、使城鄕勞苦大衆忍受極端痛苦、此恐慌甫過、新恐慌乃于一九三七年再度發生、其影饗及于各最大資本主義國家、如美國及英法、</p>
<p>無窮的財富纍積于資本主義社會上層階級手中、其結果與大衆之生活絕無利益、此無待于證明、同時資本主義國家內部情形日趨惡劣、被壓迫剝削的大衆怨聲載道、一切均促進反對資本統治之民衆憤嫉之斷然爆發、此尤爲人所恨見之事實、此種情形各資本國家莫不有之、吾人苟體察資本主義國家內部矛盾之狀况、即知彼等何以必須日益努力對外侵略、爭奪隣邦國土與殖民地、用戰爭再分配世界、以圖逃避上述局勢、即彼最富庶之資木主義國家亦不能以自力自救、亦無法滿足大衆之要求、資本主義社會內部力量顯已枯竭、不能自力更生、乃不得不從事帝國主義的對外侵略、此即爲現代戰爭日多日烈之眞原因、</p>

<p>「去年印行之蘇聯共產黨史及十八届本黨代表大會史丹林報吿辭中、曾詳述年來蔓延歐亞各國之第二次帝國主義大戰情形、時至今日、此戰爭且更加擴大、東方之中日戰事已達第三年、捲入戰爭之人民、在日本本國爲七千二百萬、其殖民地亦數千萬、在中國爲四寓五千萬、雙方共計幾達五萬七千萬人、在此戰爭中、被屠殺之人民已達數百萬人、被毀滅之中國城市鄕村達數千處、戰事之結束則尙遙遙無期、</p>
<p>「最近西方亦已爆發大戰、交戰者一方面爲英法兩國及其自治領與殖民地、一方面爲歐洲第二大國德國、捲入戰爭之人民、苟將英法殖民地人口計入、總共幾達七萬五千萬、東西兩方合計、參戰人民不計殖民地爲七萬萬、計入殖民地則超過十三萬萬、全球人口共二十一萬二千萬、而捲入歐亞兩處戰爭者已過半數、此即資本主義世界今日所表現之主要之成績「而其範圍猶不止此、雖蘇聯不受他人操縱、未被捲入戰爭、然在資本主義世界方面、則交戰者尙在努力勾引新的友軍、使中立國加入己方作戰、此種企圖近已部份地發生效力、例如英法與土耳其之簽定互助公的、即已引起嚴重問題、此外、勾引巴爾幹及斯坎的那維亞各國參戰之伎倆亦在進行之中、苟英法統治階級努力延長戰事、用以鞏固世界覊權、保全殖民地之企圖成功、戰事因而持久、歐洲中立國家必日益减少、參戰國家自必增多、同時且有某某國家假中立爲面具、陰自煽動戰事擴大、俾得坐視交戰者之自相殘殺毀滅、從而漁人取利、</p>
<p>「由此觀之、歐亞兩洲之戰爭不但結束無日、戰爭之情叙且日益高漲、緣帝國主義國家業已失去自力改善內部之自信、而惟以新的帝國主義征略爲務、企圖打倒競爭者、攫取其殖民地、再分配世界以自肥、</p>

<p>蘇維埃白俄羅斯增加其面積及人口幾達一倍、現在擁有人口達一千萬、較之許多歐洲國家爲多、從此後白俄羅期人民之分裂將不復有矣、白俄羅斯人民在其領土各處現已聯合一致、吾儕可謂白俄羅斯之完整業經完全恢復、</p>
<p>至於烏克蘭人民亦然、烏克蘭人民於過去許多世紀中、曾經分裂爲數部、並長受極端之壓迫、茲者烏克蘭人民亦得聯合一致矣、烏克蘭人民代表過去曾爲民族解放運動作無數之犧牲者、其向來所抱之希望亦得實現、最後吾儕亦可謂烏克蘭從此後永遠聯合一致、吾儕相信烏克蘭以其現有之三千九百萬人口及其人口增加之迅速、將凌駕某數大國之上、例如具有四千二百萬人口之法國、吾儕之烏克蘭及白俄羅斯共和國國土大增、西烏克蘭及西俄羅斯之兄弟輩欣然加入爲蘇維埃國民、並信任其將來、整個之解聯業經長大、並伸張其邊境於西陲頗廣、</p>

<p>此外農業雖因氣候不佳、但仍有進展、穀類產額竟達六十五萬萬布特、較去年增百份之十一、棉產額增百份之五、亞麻增百份之十六、甜菜百份之廿六、馬鈴薯增百份之六十、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况回風略起、人心尙佳、買戶以港帮及外商爲最力、故外匯雖已入徘徊之境、而金價結果一度猛升、當日過程初開疲落十元、爲三千四百五十元、嗣後因匯市略軟、拉高二十元、乃金號力進故也、惟不久匯市報鬆、錢兌業競塞、即落達三千四百十元低價、旋因外商銀行亦託證券帮買金、價遂回高、盤旋於三千四百三五十元之間、迨至午後匯市繼續回平、金號及港帮忽來市搜購、竟猛漲至三千五百〇五元、入後現金及證券帮等乘高拋塞、遂止漲步落、結果晚收爲三千四百九十元、比上日回漲三十元、全天交易稍淸約一千二三百兩、銀樓飾金掛大五元、海關金等仍平、</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况豐匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市、風波已平、情况又轉入盤旋狀態、允如大戰初息、必有一時沉寂、故全日鬆緊互見、行商及投機家等補空了結、新做動作、參差不一、故行市反應不烈、初開海外美英匯兌再縮二分二五、致晨開又呈英平美緊故態、開後雖略帶緊、但爲時甚暫、且亦鮮少成交、嗣以紗花帮等供塞居先、遂見步硬、惟俄而投機家見機反扒、且港帮亦有購納、是以回軟極速、但終爲出口商及日行正金猛塞、再吿硬化、延至午刻、成交漸淸、爲狀平定、午後因港電續進、雖日行不斷吐出、惟有利吃胃强旺、故一度回平至五辦士四三七五、美匯重入九元關內、爲八元九三七五、迨收盤結果、英金又吿五辦士四六八七五、美匯則仍爲八元九三七五、較上日英鬆〇三一二五、美反緊〇六二五、而期貨變動仍緊、隨現貨之走勢、聞有利曾吃日行十萬美金、爲全日最巨之成交額、</p>
<p>市况起伏不定</p>
<p>晨初以倫教大條及美銀價俱平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美。對法仍平、對滬縮一二五、美對英降二分二五、對滬跌三分、對法小一分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五辦士叫三七五、美匯八元大六八七五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃匯兌降落之故、開後美匯會喊過八元九三七五、爲狀雖略帶緊、但爲時甚暫、不久紗花帮前來吐售、兼規模較小之外商銀行、亦有拋出、是以市勢頓見步硬、計賣予匯豐·大通·某行等現貨英金五辦士半及五六二五、並現貨美匯九元〇六二五及一二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後投機家因鑒匯豐吸進、故亦前來稍扒、且聞港電其時亦來購納、致情况回軟、計購進麥加利等外行現貨英金五辦士半、及現貨美匯九元〇六二五與九元、旋以日行正金突來塞出、同時出口商亦跟踪拋售、故市象重趨步硬、計賣予外行現貨英金五辦士五三一二五及五六二五、兼現貨美匯九元〇六二五與一二五、午刻成交轉淸、爲狀漸定、延至午收銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士五三一二五、美匯九元〇六二五、比晨開英長〇九三七五、美亦硬〇九三七五、</p>
<p>美金進九元關</p>
<p>後市因港電續來扒進、雖日行正金復來　吐、但英行有利吃胃極濃、故潛勢續見回軟、計港電扒進外行現貨英金五辦士半及四六八七五、繼而有利等外行納進日行現貨美匯九元與八元九六八七五、時有利又納進正金本月份美匯八元九三七五、後現貨英金軟至五辦士四三七五、及美匯八元九三七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士四六八七五、美匯八元九三七五、本月份英金五辦士四五三一二五、美匯八元九〇六二五、結果比上日現期英均鬆〇三一二五、美反俱緊〇六二五、</p>

<p>外幣盤旋上升　美金票十一元一角半</p>
<p>昨日外幣、英美金鎊需要稍殷、市價堅穩、英美金票供給稀少、購者較增、市况上升、晨間爲十元零九角五分。嗣因美匯轉緊、客戶吸納煩殷、市價頻升、晚市漲至十一元一角五分、香港票供給未暢、亦趨堅俏、法郞新加坡荷蘭安南票等納胃呆滯、且前數日未因外匯鬆動下降、故昨日軋平下跌、雖變動呆鈍、結果則趨一致也、坎拿大斐律濱票隨美金票後而堅秀、日金票盤旋帶軟、晚市爲一元二角八分、朝鮮票亦趨弱勢、晚市爲一元零九分、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱升五角、英金票升二角、美金票升一角二分、香港票升八分、法郞票降五釐、新加坡票降四角、荷蘭票降二角五分、安南票降一角三分、坎拿大票升一角、斐律濱票升五分、共他各幣未更、</p>

<p>紗市同業心理、大都看漲、無奈實際消化不良、以致存貨有增無减、紗市之壓迫尤重、故匯票放長之刺激在第二步、根本問題消費爲第一也、所以雖有同行收進、一時籌碼稍緊見昂、旋聞客銷不來、即吿下墜、不過目前一般販賣商大致虧本、並且損失殊巨不願脫卸、同時原棉脚地尙堅、市態盤旋之力更强、</p>

<p>本棉交易平凡、永安廠又辦通花二千包價比上日跌一元、爲一百三十一元、鈔票送廠、其他廠商絕無動靜、故棉市氣勢益覺暗澹、大勢不離徘徊之象、近日外匯步步放長、致外棉換算價接近、各廠開始購訂額量日見增進、華棉地位、被其侵奪、因之市情受其牽制、蘇北來源續而不斷、通州花到一千〇二十九包、常陰沙七百五十七包、北沙到六百七十包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>

<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來殊見活躍、中日廠方俱有訂開、爲數不小也、昨日同業訂購亦頗熱鬧、大部爲長纖維者、然皆爲即裝船之期貨爲多、業已裝運在途之美棉、因爲數過微、早被購買一空、屆時到貨、現貨又將居奇矣、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日晨初因投機者之購買、市况殊爲堅定、布疋暢銷、引起現貨交易、遠東交易亦見起色、後因一部份多頭了結、棉價因被帮落、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落十餘磅音，印度連同預測跌一羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、利物浦漲十餘便士、</p>

<p>客尖昨市續行奔騰、緣滬棧存貨薄弱、一般客家、率皆藏貨、靜俟高峯、致市上鮮有出樣、而另一方面、零躉作客、反不以價貴退縮、一意搜求、於是競相抬價、佔先爲快、故市貨一千三四百包、霎時告罄、其中允以江北尖粳較爲轟動、初開即升半元、爲二十二元半、以後一路飛騰、收盤爲二十三元、比前市高漲一元有奇、京蕪尖並呈秀色、本尖若蘆羊尖等貨價格似已較廉、遂有問津、行情回升半元光景、</p>
<p>粳市續到蘇嘉崑太楓靑等貨二十三四車、而常帮貨雖聞由白茆口及滸口裝輪運滬、惟據錫帮客家言、該地搬述證因受僞府阻難、且該地農村、介於游擊隊活躍區、尙屬不易、但聞已在極力疏通中、不日或可見貨云云、昨市各粳銷塲、晨問猶滯、秈米與决粳價距離僅爲三元、標準相別、已屬不足、反引起客戶暢辦、行情回漲四五角不一、菉種窰種百哥等新薄稻、則以身骨軟弱、不堪儲積、遂乏秀色、陰變元因酒戶帮及飯担去路仍活、並見帶緊、香粳與冬春等花色品亦佳、</p>
<p>另訊、客秈連朝消化活潑、市價拾級上升後、市乃不與粳米同步驟矣、昨日江北秈祇有尾存到埠、京蕪秈亦乏大量駁出、且昨調查江北秈存底僅有九千多包、京蕪秈雖有整票儲存東區、而租界各棧寥寥無幾、昨日商祇有小數直接配出、正式批售則又停手、因此江北秈首先提升、蕪秈繼漲、晨間一度漲起八九角至元外、後有行囤吐出始平、結果仍較大八九角、而高客秈則已昂至二十三元三角云、</p>

<p>麵粉　連日本客交易、一致平淡、南北洋帮均有抑小再取之意、本街亦嫌價高、不願多取、所以人心轉弱、回籠貨市面更見鬆軟、僅開七元二三角、新老棧單相義約五六分、惟廠家售意尙不過於遷就、故二號粉廠盤仍七元四角、客盤七元四角半至四角、砲車牌仍須七元五角、成交總數約近三萬包、恐今明廠盤或有减小之可能、查麵粉兮日有二萬四千四百八十包運塘沽、又有八千三百五十包、運往天津、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日來源不多、新到各貨大都上棧待沽、自前日囤戶一度搜辦後、貨方售意更堅、惟粉市已轉鬆軟、原料亦受連帶影響、結果市面漲易跌難、統市由福阜兩廠辦進萬包、市塲方面做七車、價續緊俏、</p>

<h3 id="c97">參見盲童福啞兩學校 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>我們級中的英文敎本，採取了聞名世界的盲聾女子海倫克勒（Helen　Keller）的自傳本，讀後，我們的英文敎師美國人麥敦小姐向我們建議設：「你們願意去參觀上海盲童學校嗎？」級中各人一致贊同，麥小姐就寫了一封信給盲童學校的校長菲特先生（Mr．G．B．Fryer）徵求同意，菲先生的回信是歡迎我們去參觀。</p>
<p>盲童學校的校址，戰前是在虹橋路，戰後才搬到滬西白利南路三十七號B，同仁難民醫院的後面，繼續開學。那天下午，我們爲了避免注目起見，決定各人自己出發.</p>
<p>這天，校長菲特先生親自來招待，向我們講述盲童學校的始創及其歷史。菲特先生年近高年，白髮滿頭，但精神飽滿，國語也很流暢。</p>
<p>據他說：遠在一七九〇年，有一法人始創盲童學校於法國，其後漸漸傳佈歐洲，美國，及世界各地。據統計結果，全世界的盲人，共有六百萬人之多，而單獨中國一處，有一百萬盲人，成六與一之比。中國盲人之所以那樣多，乃由於一般人民，缺乏保護眼睛的常識。在全中國，共有三十多個盲人學校的設立，但自戰後，因種種關係停辦的，亦有不少。其後，菲特先生對於啞巴說話的方法，亦有詳細的叙述。大概分四點：（一）敎以如何發音；（二）看敎者嘴的動作；（三）寫字的方法；（四）手的動作。菲特先生講述後，就由兩位敎師引導我們往各敎室參觀。</p>
<p>盲童和福啞同在一起，福啞位在樓下，育童學校在樓上。我們首先參觀福啞學校，在一間敎室裏，有許多不能言語的學生，現在也會說些單音言語了，但不是很流利，我們聽着也不大懂。據那位敎師說：敎啞巴學話，頗爲困難，因爲啞巴自小就不能用他的發音器官了。第二個敎室裏，是年齡較大的學生，據說是五年級。敎師也是一個啞巴，他用手勢告訴他們一句說話，然後令一個學生，寫在黑板上，中英文俱寫，並且發音流利得多。在敎室外的走廊壁上，滿掛着學生們所畫的圖畫，有一輻圖畫，畫着一個髮長半尺的老人像，那就是創立福啞學校的傅蘭雅博士。福啞學校參觀畢，循上樓梯，到盲童學校。先領到一間房，裏面站着六七個可愛的兒童，面孔紅潤得像蘋果，可惜眼睛深深的陷下去，是盲子。他們唱一首歌兒給我們聽，另一室里，是年齡大的，男女都有，檯子上放着幾本他們的課本。在我們看來，那些課本很特別，紙上是一個一個的小洞，一位盲童用手摸着讀一篇英文故事給我們聽。最後，領至一音樂室，由一年二十左右的盲童作鋼琴獨奏。</p>
<p>最後關於盲童和福啞兩學校的經濟問題，我很願述一述。盲童學校有他們的基余輔助，而福啞學校是沒有的，獨靠學生的學費收入，作維持之用，據他們說，再過不久，他們恐怕要搬塲了。我們常以爲盲童啞巴無可造就，從那天的參觀中，事實吿訴我們，盲子啞巴非但能有所造就，並能出人頭地，願社會人士，多多的贊助道種學校，因爲，這不獨爲盲童啞巴僩人的幸福問題，却且爲國家造就更多的人才呢。</p>

<p>天津的英租界是緊緊的被封鎖着，幾乎透不出一口氣來，除了山西路之外，各處的交界口蜿蜓的接着電網。所以山西路的兩旁，比以前熱鬧了許多，放着的麵攤，大餅攤，牛肉攤……是專做着待檢查者饑餓時的生意，因爲檢查時等着二三個鐘點，或半天是時有的事。</p>
<p>路的中段用木柵隔着五個通行的口子，中央較大一些是通行汽車及其他載重車子，左右各二個口子，以便車子與行人各走各規定的路綫。在木柵的一旁，有木板築成的一座小屋，一共三間，其中間爲囚室，如有犯規者，就得禁囚，甚至遭遇一次莫明其妙的毒打的也有。</p>
<p>每天終可以聽到各種新奇的不幸者的消息，在這檢查口上。下面是我所看到的一幕：</p>
<p>「解開你的紐扣！」僞警喊着。</p>
<p>「是！先生！」一個同胞和氣地回答。</p>
<p>「你往那兒去？」僞警瞪着眼嚴重地又問。</p>
<p>「家裏。」他微笑着，但掩不住顫慄害怕的神氣。</p>
<p>「你幹嗎的！」</p>
<p>「在洗染公司裏常職員。」他依然很和靄地回答。</p>
<p>僞警的雙手不住地在他身上檢查，雜亂的東摸西搜，不肯放鬆一些，突然的從衣角裏摸出一張鈔票來：</p>
<p>「哼！藏在那麼秘密的地方！不許走！把他押起來！」神氣活現的向他自衛。</p>
<p>「不…先生……因爲家裏正待着要用…先生！……」他的險上由白而靑，抖索着唇舌，幾乎說不出話來。</p>
<p>「哼！還裝樣！中國票子是禁止用的！你曉得嗎？哼！給我押起來！」說着便把票子放進自己的口袋裏。</p>
<p>他想說訴求，但早已被拉進了囚室。</p>

<p>第十七回　習外勤報人新領域　服內務學舍小排塲</p>
<p>吳君素是個最喜歡交友的人，凡是姊妹輩，話得投機的，只要一兩天工夫　便覺很熟了。使像何家兩位小姐，不過因爲她們第一次到蘇州來，與吳君素同車，金澹雲便託她隨時照料。她就覺得何氏姊妹，氣誼相投，十分莫逆。又因爲朱愛人也是素識，所以上一回東吳大學演劇，她便邀她們去看戲，自己做一個東道主人。她與何氏姊妹，大有相見恨晚之雅。但也不獨是對於雙玉儷玉兩人，別的姊妹們，若是旨趣相投的，都是如此。加着她爲人和藹可親，人家也願意與她訂交。又好在她住的地方，却在蘇州，與學校相近，地址也很幽靜。蘇州又是時常經由之路，姊妹輩與她相熟的，順便就去訪問她一下。她又是位好客的人，屋子裏只有她們姊妹兩人，倘然朋友們躭擱一天二天，她可以聯牀共話，掃楊淸談。否則至少也留一餐飯，以示股勤之意。邵慧華也是吳君素的愛好的同學姊妹，她偶經蘇州，總要去訪問吳君素的。吳君素總留着她，不肯放着她就走。因爲邵慧華肚裏的新鮮故事兒太多了，吳君素說：「要留住她，作一個長夜十日之談。」邵慧華說：「不要說什麼十日之談吧，我要講起來，只怕講一年功夫也講不完咧。你倘若要寫小說時，我可以供給你不少材料，只要自己去整理就是了。」邵慧華和金澹雲也是很密切的，因爲余澹雲外國朋友多，她去訪問時，常請澹雲作介紹。道一回，澹雲和林建成結婚，她自然要來吃喜酒的。前幾天，她奉了館方的命令，派她到福建去公幹。那時從浙江造到幅建去的一條鐵路，最近舉行通車典禮。又是一處民用飛機塲，在福建沿海某縣行落成禮，有各省的飛機，都飛來祝賀。還有一件事，福建一家很大的糖廠，行開幕禮。這家糖廠，是福建在南洋羣島的華僑，集資開辦的，規模非常之大。這三件事，擠在一起，因此館裏非派一位特派員去不可了。在那個民用飛機塲行落成禮的那一天，他們知道邵慧華小姐能開飛機的，他們還請她駕着飛機，在犬空作了種種的花，式飛行，敎許多觀看的人，都鼓掌稱善不止。　（二〇〇）</p>

<h3 id="c102">五彩片的攝製法 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 競爭</p>
<p>五彩片在近幾年，巳有相當的成功，各公司所攝製的影片，已不在少數。那種絢爛鮮艷的彩色，常能予觀衆以美感。但是，這種片子是怎樣攝製的呢？恐怕有許多人需要知道的吧。</p>
<p>這種五彩攝影機，在開拍的時候，是先由鏡頭吸收光綫，經過三稜鏡分開紅，綠，藍三原色的色帶，分別射入三張感光不同的膠片，加以化學手續，將影像决第染色，遂成五彩片的初步工作。</p>
<p>機內有三張膠片，一張是直向着鏡頭，其餘二張是連着放在影箱的左旁，與鏡頭成九十度的角度。另有一洒着金色小點的三稜玻璃，豎置斜放在箱中，向鏡頭構成四十五角度</p>
<p>攝影的過程中：光綫穿過鏡頭而進入機內，一部分光經過三稜鏡，射進正面抹塗着綠乳狀液之膠片。所餘下的光綫則被鏡阻住，而折射于兩張旁片；此折射錢是通過一張紅色鏡的（此鏡只任紅藍色帶透過），射進那兩張連搭的膠片，其中的一張染着黃色的膠片，將藍色的色帶留住而印上牠的影像；而紅色色帶則被通過將影像印在後面的一張膠片上。于是同一個塲面，拍成了三種底片。這三種片子，綠色的是攝了塲面綠色部分的黑白轉來的陰影，同時紅藍二片也各各保留了各箇顏色，和膠片感受色調强度之能力而成的影象。換言之，此等底片爲「母片」，每張「母片」的着色是僅限于牠所攝影像之顯著部分（即由鏡頭吸收所有原本光綫與陰影），將這三片冲晒在一張「子片」上，那便成了「五彩片」了。</p>
<p>這當然是很簡單的報吿，不過明其大略而已。五彩片還沒有在中國被攝製過，我希望電影界在最近的將來，能有一部美麗的彩色片成功。</p>

<p>— 于素蓮</p>
<p>我從十四歲學戲到現在，差不多也足有八年了。開始，我簡直不知道為什麽演戲，只是憑着一腔愛好的熱忱，和濃厚的興趣而已。要到近年，接觸到各方面的人羣，常常有機會討論到戲劇的問題。我便開始認識戲劇的眞面目。無庸諱言的，那時我才知道演戲唱戲，並不只是單純的爲着娛樂。戲劇本身是有着「批評人生；表現人生；指導人生」的意義存在的。我在台上唱戲，搬演人生的悲歡離合，便是實現這一點的一員。</p>
<p>「至於說到改良平劇，我曾在卡爾登同周信芳先生演過一個短時問。那時，爲了種種的限制，只是一種局部的改革而已。可是，我已覺得比以前唱戲，有着不同的意義了。演來也更能透澈，更令我興奮。</p>
<p>「我認爲平劇的改良是一樁至艱且鉅的工作，不是少數人可以担負起來的。而且也不是短促的時間可以驟然改過來的。我知道要得到各方面的助力與同情，尤其是編劇者應該給我們演劇者的人多多幫助。如過去的歐陽予倩先生專把舊戲改編，給演改良平劇的不少便利。他眞是改良平劇中的一大功臣呢。</p>
<p>「唱戲不應該只當是職業，但圖糊口，還應當把牠當作事業，一件有意義有目標的事業去幹。因此，非要把終身獻給這事業上頭，是不易見效的。我這次在新都上演改良平劇，便是抱着這點覜點。深深接受各方的指正與幫助呢。」</p>

<p>老生老旦之戞調</p>
<p>許多年來所謂名鬚生倘能將「探母」之「呌小番」使一憂調，聽者卽贊歎不已，認爲難能可貴。其實此種憂調，猶憂調中之最普通而最易爲者。若靠把老生戲「戰太平」及老旦戲「目蓮救母」中之二黃憂調，不但不似「呌小番」之音短而促，且須於憂調中使一長腔，倘本錢不足之伶工，莫不視爲畏途，決不敢冒然問津也。富英前數年南來，皆不得志，臺下觀衆對其技藝亦均淡然置之，迨年來嗓音轉佳，又新學「戰太平」一劇，於是不論出演平滬，無不大受顧客熱烈歡迎，聞其近來包銀已較五穴年前增加三四倍以上。其實一齣「戰太平」，論武功猶不若「定軍山」繁難吃重，論唱唸亦不比「定軍山」「南陽關」「雄州關」等多出幾許，不過該劇中有二黃有西皮，同時在兩種不同的腔調中，又各有使憂調的機會，唱角只要嗓音宏亮雄實即可格外顯出大將身分，及英雄落魄之慘境，因此而益覺是劇之吸引力較爲强大。是故不特成名已久之譚富英於初貼該劇時曾哄動九城，即甫列叔岩門牆之李少春，亦以此劇而大受故都顧曲界之熱烈捧塲也。（一三六）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Fighting Near Mianyang; Chinese Troops Launch Counterattack on Xiantao Town; Shelling Occurs Intermittently on Both Sides of the Xinqiang River Front; Situation in Western Shanxi Eases as Japanese Troops Will Be Forced to Withdraw <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - This afternoon, the Chinese military spokesman, during the weekly press briefing, announced the following regarding the Sino-Japanese war situation: Currently, the Japanese military's actions are taking place on the north bank of the Yangtze River, west of Hankou. Their objective is likely to deal with the Chinese forces active in the triangular area between the Hanshui and Yangtze Rivers. The Japanese troops in Qianjiang, south of the Hanshui River, have moved southeast towards Xiantao Town. Other Japanese troops in Hanyang are also moving west, intending to link up with the advancing forces. After occupying Xiantao Town, the Japanese troops advanced towards Mianyang, where the city walls were also destroyed. The Chinese troops are now counterattacking, and the battle is currently taking place near Mianyang. According to the spokesman, the Japanese military wants to clear out the Chinese forces west of Hankou for two reasons: (1) Chinese artillery units in Xiantao Town frequently shelled Japanese transport ships on the Hanshui River; (2) Chinese air force recently bombed the Hankou airfield, flying through the area between the Hanshui and Yangtze Rivers, catching the Japanese off guard without any prior warning. The spokesman also mentioned the Japanese military's activities in western Shanxi, stating that the Japanese military's offensive there was aimed at clearing out the Chinese forces active in the Lüliang Mountains of western Shanxi. When the Japanese troops surrounded the counties of Daning, Xi County, Pu County, and Xiangning from the north, south, and east, the Chinese troops retreated into the mountains to avoid direct conflict, disrupting the Japanese transportation lines and preventing the arrival of supplies and reinforcements. All food and supplies in the villages were taken away by the Chinese troops. The Japanese troops will eventually be forced to withdraw from western Shanxi. Once the Japanese troops on all fronts withdraw eastward to their bases, Chinese mobile units will intercept them at strategic locations in the mountains. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Miluo - Artillery battles occurred between both sides in front of the Xinqiang River and Wujiuling on the morning of the 7th. Two Japanese warships and over ten motorboats patrolled the surface of Dongting Lake on the afternoon of the 7th, conducting a brief reconnaissance before retreating northward. (Dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The situation in western Shanxi has now eased, but there are reports of a tense situation in southern Shanxi. It is reported that since November 1st, Japanese artillery units on the north bank of the Yellow River have continuously shelled Tongguan fiercely. On November 3rd, over 400 shells were fired, and on the 4th, even more shells were fired, no less than 840 shells. The shelling continued on the 5th. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Luoyang - Small-scale engagements still occur from time to time in southeastern Shanxi. On the 2nd, about 500 Japanese infantry and cavalry soldiers with four artillery pieces advanced southward from Suzidian, south of Changzhi, towards the Huangling Wanghuai area to harass the area. After fierce interception by Chinese troops and several days of fierce fighting, many Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining Japanese troops retreated along their original route, with intentions to invade westward. (Dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>Xingji - On the night of the 1st, Chinese troops attacked Dongye Town, north of Xiyang. A fierce battle raged throughout the night, and many Japanese soldiers were annihilated south of Dongye Town. Two light machine guns, fifteen rifles, and many military supplies were seized. (Dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>Xingji - Japanese troops from Shenchi and Wuzhai attacked southward along the Kelan Avenue on the 25th and 26th of last month but were repelled by Chinese troops. Earlier, over 300 Japanese soldiers, a combined force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, advanced in two routes on the morning of the 25th, one from Liangjiaping (southwest of Wuzhai) Jiejiepai (south of Wuzhai) and the other from Shuikoutou Gejiaping. Chinese troops advanced from ××× and occupied the mountain peaks of Gucheng Village, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese. Another unit flanked the Japanese side. The Japanese were defeated and retreated. The next morning, reinforcements arrived, numbering over a thousand. One route went from Jiejiepai Zhangzicun to occupy the mountain peaks of Kangjiahui, one route went from Liangjiaping through the mountain ridge to Zhao'an Village, and one route went from Shuikoutou to Dizicun, attempting to encircle Jingjingbo (southwest of Wuzhai). Chinese troops engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat and charged. Another unit flanked and attacked Zhangzi Village and Kangjiahui. The battlefront stretched for over ten miles. Chinese troops fought hard all day, and the Japanese troops finally retreated in the direction of Shenchi and Wuzhai. (7th)</p>

<p>Changsha - In the Battle of Northern Hunan, the heroic deeds of the Chinese army are too numerous to mention, and the battle of Caoxieling, led by Platoon Leader Fang Changgui of the Shi Battalion, was the most tragic. At that time, the Japanese army fiercely attacked the front of the Xinqiang Line without success. On the morning of September 22nd, they changed their tactics and used heavy troops to continuously attack Caoxieling. This place was strategically located on the half-bank of Wagang, a southern branch of the Xinqiang River. Platoon Leader Fang was one of the units responsible for defending the mountain tops near the area, solemnly aware of the importance of his mission. The battle was extremely fierce. By noon on September 22nd, the platoon's front was jointly attacked by Japanese land, sea, and air forces more than ten times. Although the position remained intact, the entire platoon, from Platoon Leader Fang to all the brave soldiers, had sacrificed themselves for the country. Only Ren Lianzi, a young recruit of only twenty years old, remained, still providing final support at the original position. At this time, Guan Zhenzhong, another platoon leader in the same battalion, was surprised that the gunfire from the area was sparse. He specially requested permission from the company commander to go and inspect. When he arrived, he saw that on this majestic mountain top, apart from this brave lone soldier, there was almost no one else. Platoon Leader Guan then patted Ren on the shoulder and said, "I will accompany you here and shed the last drop of blood with our comrades." Then, they collected hand grenades left behind by their fallen comrades and continued to throw them to repel the Japanese who were forcibly climbing the mountain top three times. Until dusk, Liu Qingnian, the cook for Platoon Leader Fang’s platoon, delivered the entire platoon’s meals to the position as usual, and as usual, issued a report that the food had arrived before reaching the position. However, this time, the person answering the report was not Platoon Leader Fang, but Platoon Leader Guan. Going forward, he saw that his old friend, who used to scold him for cooking the dishes too salty or too bland, was now lying down with this majestic mountain as if they were sleeping together forever. The cook was very alert and rushed to report to the company commander. Soon after, the company commander led the entire team to rush over and replaced Platoon Leader Guan. However, this brave lone soldier, Ren Lianzi, had unfortunately suffered a glorious wound. A certain officer, after learning the situation, highly praised him and had already promoted Platoon Leader Guan to company commander and promoted Ren Lianzi and Liu Qingnian to sergeant. The reporter met Ren Lianzi in the hospital and chatted with him, expressing condolences. (Dispatch of the 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Third International Appeals to World Labor to Aid China's Anti-Aggression War; Imperialist Countries Drive People to the Battlefield; Should Bear Full Responsibility for War Due to Mutual Hegemonic Struggle <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - The Executive Committee of the Third International issued a letter to workers and the proletariat worldwide today, relentlessly criticizing capitalist countries and listing Germany and the United Kingdom and France together as capitalist countries (Germany no longer recognizes itself as a capitalist country), stating that the goal of the ruling classes of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in launching the war is to attempt to control the world, and that they should bear the responsibility for the current war. Regarding the situation in the Far East, they called on workers of all countries to unite and defend the Chinese nation against "imperialist aggressors," and at the same time, as usual, criticized the American bourgeoisie and arms merchants, the leader of the French Socialist Party, Blum, the Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, Stone House, and the leaders of the British Labour Party. The following is a summary of the original text:</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Third International declared that all transportation routes and the largest raw material supply areas in the world are controlled by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, and more than half of all human beings are also under the high pressure of these countries. As for the current war, its true meaning is a kind of "unfair, reactionary, imperialist war," that is, a war for the capitalist countries to compete for colonies and world hegemony. The goal of the ruling classes of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in launching the war was originally to attempt to control the world, and they should bear the responsibility for the war. The "bourgeoisie" in various neutral countries or so-called neutral countries are using the war to profit from it. The American bourgeoisie can make huge profits for the country's industry by manufacturing arms, so they decided to abolish the arms embargo clauses. The Italian bourgeoisie is also waiting for an opportunity to attack the defeated at an appropriate time and share the spoils together, which shows that the governments of various neutral countries only know how to use the war to oppress the working class. In the Soviet Union, "over the past twenty years, it has been constantly striving to preserve peace. Although others have repeatedly provoked actions on the Soviet border, the country still has great determination to ensure peace and has put forward various proposals advocating universal disarmament and the organization of a collective security system. The country has also done its best to form a lasting peace front, but the governments of capitalist countries have not only turned a deaf ear but have even attempted to isolate the Soviet Union. Although others have added various traps to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union still regards maintaining peace as its duty. Even when the war was imminent, the Soviet government still made a final effort to save the catastrophe and held talks with the United Kingdom and France. However, those who launched the war used this talk to deceive the masses and blame others for the war. In fact, these people encouraged Poland to oppose the Soviet Union on the one hand, and on the other hand, when talking with the Soviet Union, those who are outside the European war rely on this treaty. In short, those who launched the war want to push the war to the whole world and lead all nations to the slaughterhouse, and they will not stop the war until they achieve their imperialist goals. At this time, the Soviet Union is working hard to prevent the nations of the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River basin from being drawn into the vortex." As for the situation in the Far East, workers all over the world must unite to defend the Chinese nation and resist "imperialist aggressors." (Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Soviet General Says Red Army Is Strong <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - Marshal Voroshilov, the Soviet People's Commissar of Defense, recently issued an order commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the October Revolution. The article first describes the achievements of the Soviet Union in various aspects over the past year, and then says,</p>
<p>"In the past year, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army has followed the entire country, and its military strength has increased several times. 1.93 million middle school graduates and young people have enthusiastically joined the army, and there are many who refuse to use the exemption law. Many elders have also requested that their children be allowed to enlist before the deadline. "This year, like last year, the Red Army was forced to show its combat power to protect the territorial integrity and independence of the friendly Mongolian People's Republic, thereby proving the effectiveness of the mutual assistance treaty signed by the Soviet government. Red Army soldiers and officers showed supreme glory in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol.</p>
<p>"The Red Army's move to liberate the Ukrainian and Belarusian compatriots from the shackles of the landlords is also a glorious page in the history of the Soviet people this year. When the Red Army fought against the Polish army, it not only showed excellent marching and maneuvering abilities, but also showed extreme bravery and initiative, as well as loyalty to the motherland and the great cause of Lenin Stalin. The Red Army's liberation campaign will be immortalized in history.</p>
<p>"The Soviet people, backed by the powerful Red Army and Navy, are still consistently pursuing a policy of peace and continuing their peaceful labor, and are paying attention to the complicated and dangerous international situation at all times. We must not be caught unprepared. We can distinguish friends from enemies. Our Stalinist far-sighted diplomatic policy will never allow us to be dragged into the war by those who are used by others to take chestnuts from the fire. The European war provoked by the United Kingdom and France has not yet reached the point of spreading, but the aggressors of the United Kingdom and France have no intention of peace, but are trying to expand the war and involve all countries in the vortex. The Soviet government strictly adheres to neutrality and strives to restore the peace that the people of all countries unanimously expect. The Soviet Union is strong, and the Soviet people have deep confidence in today and the future. The Red Army is ready to respond to any eventuality at any time," etc. (TASS dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Kuznetsov, the Soviet People's Commissar of the Navy, recently issued an order commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the October Revolution. The article first describes all the achievements in the country in the past 22 years, and then says,</p>
<p>"The 22nd anniversary of the October Revolution is a year of further development and strengthening of our navy. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party and Stalin, the Soviet Union has solved the historical task and created a powerful ocean fleet commensurate with the national strength. Many new ships have been launched and will be launched this year, and naval personnel are also proficient in naval technology. The Navy, like the entire Red Army, is always ready to defend the motherland's sea borders." (TASS dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Red Square Military Parade; Army and Navy March in Formation <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - Today is the 22nd anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The Soviet government held its annual military parade in Red Square. All members of the German embassy and members of the country's trade delegation attended the ceremony. A total of 20,000 members of the army and navy participated in the parade, led by Deputy People's Commissar of Defense, General Putini. The first row was composed of students from the Army University, followed by officers from the General Staff. Next were several teams of infantry, cavalry, and naval officers and soldiers, followed by motorized units, anti-aircraft artillery units, heavy artillery units, and heavy tank units at the rear. According to various foreign military experts, there are no new features in the weapons this year except for the new heavy-duty vehicles for transporting troops. People's Commissar of Defense, General Voroshilov, gave a brief speech before the review, reviewing the country's progress in the past year, and briefly said, "To this day, Soviet citizens can be proud of the smooth running of our country." The result of the Red Army's operations in Poland did not disappoint the government's expectations. The bravery of the reserve soldiers at all levels was no different from that of the regular army. They were able to defeat the enemy in a very short period of time. As for the current war in Europe, we will never participate in it, but we will always be vigilant. At the same time, our fleet is ready and can be dispatched at any time." In addition, huge slogans were posted all over the city, reading "The two regions of Western Ukraine and Belarus have been liberated." In addition, many Soviet party, government, and military officials attended the ceremony. The former People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, was also listed, but his face was pale and he did not talk to anyone. (Havas dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<p>Moscow - The Moscow Soviet held a celebration of the 22nd anniversary of the October Revolution at the Grand Theater yesterday. Representatives from the Central Committee and the Moscow Party Committee, the Soviets, trade unions, public institutions, Stakhanovite workers, shock workers, and intellectuals all attended. When Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Beria, Shvernik, Malenkov, Dimitrov, and Bulgamin arrived, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause. The meeting was presided over by Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, who delivered a report commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the October Revolution, which lasted for one hour. His speech was interrupted by applause from time to time. After the meeting, a grand concert was held, and famous artists and musicians from Moscow performed. (TASS dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e11">Statements from the Third International and Molotov <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Today marks the 22nd anniversary of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, established in October 1917 according to the Russian calendar. The Soviet Union celebrates this anniversary every year with grand ceremonies. Twenty-two years ago, the First World War was raging, and Russia was one of the participating countries. Lenin's followers, with a revolutionary stance, internally led the workers and peasants to eradicate the old system, and externally abandoned the allied nations, withdrawing from the battlefield. Their ideology transcended the mere reorganization of political power, and the international environment allowed them to be self-reliant and build an independent nation. Historically, this was a golden opportunity. However, upon examining its essence, it was due to uncompromising internal and external policies, relying on the masses for strength, and adhering to ideology as the soul, that the source of the Soviet Union's new life was created. It was not simply a matter of seizing an opportunity.</p>
<p>On the eve of this anniversary, the party and state authorities in Moscow each expressed their confidence and satisfaction. It is fitting for a strong nation, during its national day, especially when it is outside the vortex of war and its every move is tied to international affairs, to be proud and self-assured. Among them, the following are noteworthy: first, the Executive Committee of the Third International issued a letter to the workers and proletariat of the world; second, Soviet People's Commissar Chairman and Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov delivered a speech on the general situation at home and abroad. As of the time of this writing, the full text of the Third International's communiqué has not yet been obtained. According to reports from Reuters and Havas in Moscow, in addition to promoting communism, it spares no effort in criticizing capitalist countries. It regards Britain, France, and Germany, the European countries at war, as being of the same ilk, merely warring with each other due to conflicting interests, and does not forgive Britain and France. As for the Far East, it accuses Japan of being an imperialist aggressor, trampling on China for more than two years. China is still fighting for independence, and it proclaims to the world's laborers to unite and jointly protect China. The Third International and the Soviet government each have their own systems, forms, and fields of activity. However, the coordination and application between them are complex and subtle. To say they are two in one, or one in two, seems to be true, but is not entirely so. Generally speaking, Soviet policy must be in line with the principles of the Third International, but the two do not necessarily coincide in time and space. Today, the Third International is making a righteous appeal to the world's laborers for China's resistance against the so-called "imperialist aggressors," but this is quite a distance from practical planning and effective action. However, in China, which is in the midst of a difficult war of resistance, this comforting warmth, and the knowledge that Soviet policy will not contradict what the Third International has declared, will surely be welcome.</p>
<p>As for Molotov's speech, readers should take the time to read the full text. We may not fully agree with his theories, nor fully sympathize with his attacks, nor fully doubt his defenses. However, he is one of the leaders of socialism and the responsible authority of the Soviet government. He is responsible for Soviet diplomacy in the past six months, and he praises the fusion of socialism and patriotic sentiment, saying, "Soviet patriotism has a solid foundation," and "This kind of patriotism has penetrated the minds of the Soviet Red Army and the people." If we were in his place, starting from patriotism, and making these kinds of attacks and defenses, who would not understand? Everything he said should be viewed separately as the Soviet authorities speaking from a patriotic standpoint.</p>
<p>China establishes its nation on the Three Principles of the People, and the Principle of People's Livelihood occupies the middle ground between capitalism and socialism. What China is fighting for is the preservation of independence and freedom, and it is resisting imperialism through the war of resistance. Today, Molotov's speech measures the merits and demerits of socialism and capitalism, and criticizes the crimes of imperialists. China is not the target of his speech. However, there is something that can be thought-provoking, and we should not reject his words simply because he is a believer in socialism: Molotov claims that the old world of capitalism is gradually declining due to old age and decay. Whether it will eventually decline, and whether old age and decay are incurable, are all major issues. However, the signs of old age and decay cannot be concealed. The international community does not value credibility, does not value justice, its actions contradict its beliefs, it seeks temporary peace for small and immediate gains, and it allows the international common principles and order to be destroyed by violence. This is a prominent sign of old age and decay. If we cannot rise up quickly and strive to correct this, then not only will there be reasons for slander, and the possibility of decline, but also those who have suffered deep trauma will want to curse it. Molotov said, "The end of the wars in Europe and Asia is nowhere in sight, because imperialist countries have lost their confidence in improving themselves internally, and only engage in aggression." He also made a judgment to show his despair for the imperialist powers, and further hoped that they would become a "new international massacre." All these arguments are the cold voice of a socialist. However, should those who engage in aggression and massacre not reflect on their weaknesses and repent for their sins? If they cannot reflect and repent, and only raise the banner of anti-communism, then they will be no different from being beasts, or tyrannical rulers. What harm will it do to communism?</p>

<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the U.S. government plans to implement "moral sanctions" against countries that bomb civilians, banning the export of American aircraft to those countries. The United States has already implemented "moral sanctions" against Japan (Reuters, 7th).</p>
<p>Washington - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Biddleman recently told the press that the U.S.-Japan trade treaty will expire on January 26th of next year, after the U.S. government announced its termination. If relations between the U.S. and Japan do not improve, the U.S. Congress will definitely grant full authority to the President to order a ban on all or part of American goods from being shipped to Japan. Japan's attitude towards China can be summarized in one sentence: absolute contempt for the rights of the U.S. and other countries. Our reminder at this time is a positive measure (Havas, 6th).</p>
<p>Washington - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Biddleman declared last night that after Congress opens in January next year, it will decide how to deal with Japan's anti-American actions in the occupied areas of China through economic pressure. He will recommend to Congress that President Roosevelt be authorized to order a ban on the sale of arms and raw materials to Japan at any time after the U.S.-Japan trade treaty officially expires on January 26th. Under the current Far East situation, it is very doubtful that the U.S. and Japan can reach a mutual understanding and renew the trade treaty. "If the recommendation to Japan can be received, U.S.-Japan relations will definitely have good results." Even if it is not implemented, it can be used as a sharp weapon for the executive authorities. The reason why Japan can ignore American protests now is because it knows "we have no action to take against them." (Associated Press, 7th).</p>
<h3 id="e13">Japanese Newspapers Disclose U.S.-Japan Talks Circumstances, Difficult to Realize Concrete Negotiations <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun disclosed today the circumstances of the talks between U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura on November 4th, stating that Grew claimed that the adjustment of U.S.-Japan relations depends on the Japanese side respecting American rights and interests in China, and urged concrete solutions to various outstanding issues. The newspaper then issued a commentary authorized by official sources, stating that Japan's position is that the United States should recognize the existing reality in East Asia and correctly interpret Japan's "construction policy" in East Asia. On this point, the U.S. and Japan should hold talks based on broad principles, so that both sides can make efforts in their respective regions to establish peace and cooperate with each other to guarantee Pacific peace. Japan believes that concrete talks between the U.S. and Japan cannot easily begin until the United States corrects its views. There are 600 outstanding cases between the U.S. and Japan, which can be divided into the following five categories: (1) bombing incidents, (2) insult incidents, (3) tobacco purchase issues, (4) the integrity of Chinese customs, and (5) payment for railway materials. Japan holds the following views on the above-mentioned protests: (1) Japan is at war, so bombing incidents cannot be stopped. Japan is willing to do its best to respect American rights and interests and is willing to provide compensation for appropriate requests. (2) Insult incidents are caused by various misunderstandings caused by the war situation in China. The Japanese side is willing to make various efforts to prevent them from recurring. (3) Americans are currently not allowed to purchase tobacco in Shandong Province and elsewhere due to Japanese military operations. (4) The integrity of Chinese customs depends on the exercise of Chinese sovereignty. The United States should negotiate directly with the "new central government" of China when it is established. (5) The price of the materials ordered by the Pingjin-Shanhaiguan Railway can only be claimed from Chongqing, or allocated from the profits obtained from the railway after the United States recognizes the rights and special status of the Japanese army in China. As for Grew's request to open the Yangtze River to facilitate the shipping of third countries, the Japanese side believes that the United States should wait for the "new central government" to be established before contacting it to handle it (Reuters, 7th).</p>

<p>Tokyo - The "Asia Development Board's" plan to adjust Sino-Japanese relations has not yet been submitted to the Cabinet today. It is said that it will be submitted to the Cabinet for discussion on Friday. According to Prime Minister Abe, the plan has been informally reported to the Emperor. It is now reported that the Asia Development Board and the General Staff Headquarters are negotiating on the part of the plan that involves the Emperor's supreme command. According to the Asahi Shimbun, an imperial conference will be held approximately next month to approve this plan (Reuters, 7th).</p>

<h3 id="e16">Pound Devaluation <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>New York - Today, in the New York foreign exchange market, the British pound continued to be under pressure due to the lifting of the arms embargo. It opened at $3.9625, the same as the closing price on Saturday, but closed at $3.94. The French franc and the Dutch guilder were also weak. The French franc closed at 2.2375, and the Dutch guilder closed at 53.09 (Reuters, 6th).</p>
<p>London - A famous banker told a Reuters reporter today about the fall in the pound price in New York, saying that this is a psychological effect and seems to be only temporary. The reason for this fall is that the general public, those holding British currency, are deeply afraid that after the arms embargo is lifted, Britain will order a large number of arms from the United States, so the pound price will be lowered and they will sell their pounds. We must know that this kind of panic has no reason. First, the current estimate of the number of arms Britain will order from the United States is too high. Secondly, Britain has a large amount of U.S. dollars in its treasury, which is enough to cope with the situation. The London financial community firmly believes that the New York pound price will rebound as it did when the European war broke out. At that time, everyone knew that the U.S. ban on American ships was more beneficial to the British pound than detrimental to it, so this rebound would be even more powerful (Reuters, 7th).</p>

<h3 id="e18">October Revolution Anniversary, Molotov's Speech, Criticizes Capitalism, Reaffirms Soviet Foreign Policy, Maintains Neutrality, Strives for Peace <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, Molotov, delivered a speech yesterday at the celebration of the 22nd anniversary of the October Revolution to representatives from the Central Committee and the Moscow Party Committee, various trade unions, various Soviet agencies, Stakhanovite workers and shock workers from various factories, and intellectuals. The speech reads:</p>
<h3 id="e19">Socialism Rises, Capitalism Declines <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>"The October Revolution freed our country from capitalist society. Since then, two worlds have emerged on the planet. One is the old capitalist world, including all capitalist countries and their colonies and semi-colonies under their rule. The other is the new socialist world created by our Soviet state. The aging and decaying capitalism is already approaching its end, while the new world produced by the October Revolution is becoming stronger and more prominent. However, although capitalism is declining, its nature is quite stubborn, and it is now doing its best to prolong its existence.</p>
<p>"Capitalism in our time has contributed nothing to the people. All it has brought is constant economic panic, widespread unemployment in cities, famine and disasters in rural areas, intensified oppression of hundreds of millions of colonial peoples, and cruel and endless massacres and wars. From 1929 to 1933, capitalist countries experienced extremely severe economic panic, causing the working masses in cities and villages to endure extreme suffering. This panic had just passed when a new panic occurred again in 1937, affecting the largest capitalist countries, such as the United States, Britain, and France.</p>
<p>"Infinite wealth is accumulated in the upper classes of capitalist society, and the results are of no benefit to the lives of the masses. This does not need to be proven. At the same time, the internal situation of capitalist countries is deteriorating, and the oppressed and exploited masses are complaining. All this promotes the decisive outbreak of popular resentment against capitalist rule. This is especially a fact that people hate to see. This situation exists in all capitalist countries. If we examine the internal contradictions of capitalist countries, we will know why they must increasingly strive for external aggression, seize neighboring countries' territories and colonies, and redistribute the world through war to escape the above-mentioned situation. Even the richest capitalist countries cannot save themselves by their own efforts, nor can they meet the demands of the masses. The internal strength of capitalist society has obviously been exhausted and cannot be self-reliant, so it has to engage in imperialist external aggression. This is the real reason why modern wars are becoming more frequent and fierce.</p>
<h3 id="e20">European and Asian Wars are Intertwined, Scope Gradually Expanding <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>"The history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union published last year and Stalin's report at the 18th Party Congress have detailed the situation of the Second Imperialist War that has spread to various countries in Europe and Asia in recent years. To this day, this war has further expanded. The Sino-Japanese war in the East has reached its third year, involving 72 million people in Japan itself, tens of millions in its colonies, and 450 million in China, totaling nearly 570 million people. In this war, millions of people have been massacred, and thousands of Chinese cities and villages have been destroyed. The end of the war is still far away.</p>
<p>"Recently, a major war has also broken out in the West, with Britain and France and their autonomous territories and colonies on one side, and Germany, the second largest country in Europe, on the other. The total number of people involved in the war, including the population of British and French colonies, is nearly 750 million. Combining the East and West, the number of people participating in the war, excluding colonies, is 700 million, and including colonies, it exceeds 1.3 billion. The total global population is 2.12 billion, and the number of people involved in the wars in Europe and Asia has exceeded half. This is the main achievement of the capitalist world today." "And its scope is still not limited to this. Although the Soviet Union is not manipulated by others and has not been involved in the war, on the capitalist side, the belligerents are still trying to lure new allies to join their side in the war. This attempt has recently been partially effective. For example, the signing of a mutual assistance pact between Britain, France, and Turkey has caused serious problems. In addition, tricks to lure the Balkan and Scandinavian countries into the war are also underway. If the British and French ruling classes succeed in their attempts to prolong the war to consolidate their world domination and preserve their colonies, and the war continues for a long time, the number of neutral countries in Europe will inevitably decrease, and the number of participating countries will naturally increase. At the same time, some countries are wearing the mask of neutrality, secretly inciting the expansion of the war, in order to sit back and watch the belligerents kill and destroy each other, and then take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>"From this point of view, the wars in Europe and Asia are not only endless, but the situation of the war is also increasingly high, because the imperialist countries have lost their confidence in improving themselves internally, and only engage in new imperialist conquests, attempting to defeat their competitors, seize their colonies, and redistribute the world to enrich themselves.</p>
<p>"As mentioned above, the current war already contains the seeds of a new imperialist world war. If the working class allows the imperialist powers to carry out their policies, this war will be realized. The danger we face is that if we do not try our best to prevent it, the wars in Europe and Asia will merge into a global massacre. And this is the achievement of the capitalist world today.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Soviet Union's Ethnic Groups Get Along on the Basis of Equality <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>"While the Soviet Union is celebrating the 22nd anniversary of the October Revolution today, its achievements are completely different. Because the Soviet Union firmly implements a policy of peace, it has been able to enjoy the happiness of peace so far, and is constantly progressing in economic and cultural life. The new socialist achievements that we are celebrating today are in sharp contrast to the panic of capitalist society. We will first compare the Soviet Union, a multi-ethnic country, with bourgeois Poland, which is also a multi-ethnic country but strives to oppress ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>"The country established by the Polish warlords and capitalists and all its leaders are bankrupt. Although some major countries give it various "guarantees," bourgeois Poland cannot escape collapse. The result of its collapse not only shows its own weaknesses, but also shows that the policies adopted by certain major countries are inappropriate. The multi-ethnic Polish state was established against the will of the Polish people, based on the oppression of non-Polish ethnic groups, so in its first test, it revealed its weaknesses, instability, and bankruptcy. As for the Soviet Union, its multi-ethnic country is built on a completely different foundation, based on the equality and friendship of all ethnic groups, so it can show its powerful and indestructible stability. In the Soviet Union, all ethnic groups live in harmony, and the moral and political unity of Soviet socialist society is becoming increasingly firm. This fact is a guarantee of the unshakable strength of our country, because our country is built according to the great national policy set by Lenin and Stalin, and is built on the equal and friendly union of all ethnic groups.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Expansion of Territory in the West, Significant Success of Policy <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>"The inherent strength of the Soviet Union, its military power, and its international prestige are now becoming increasingly clear. Therefore, after the collapse of Poland and the successful campaign of our Red Army, West Ukraine, with a population of 8 million, and West Belarus, with a population of nearly 5 million, were reunited with Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Belarus. This is one of the most significant successes of our foreign policy in recent times, and one of the most glorious achievements of the Soviet Union today, and it is something that the Soviet Union can be proud of for faithfully implementing its peaceful foreign policy and the principles of labor internationalism.</p>
<p>"Soviet Belarus has almost doubled its area and population, and now has a population of 10 million, which is more than many European countries. From now on, the division of the Belarusian people will no longer exist. The Belarusian people are now united throughout their territory. We can say that the integrity of Belarus has been completely restored.</p>
<p>"As for the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian people have been divided into several parts for many centuries and have long suffered extreme oppression. Now the Ukrainian people have also been united. The hopes of the representatives of the Ukrainian people, who have made countless sacrifices for the national liberation movement in the past, have also been realized. Finally, we can also say that Ukraine will be united forever from now on. We believe that Ukraine, with its current population of 39 million and its rapid population growth, will surpass certain major countries, such as France, with a population of 42 million. Our Ukrainian and Belarusian republics have greatly increased their territory, and their brothers and sisters in West Ukraine and West Russia have happily joined the Soviet Union and trust their future. The entire Soviet Union has grown and expanded its borders quite widely in the West.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Lenin Analyzes the International Situation, Theory Becomes Reality <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>"The Soviet Union has the greatest reason to celebrate this 22nd anniversary of the October Revolution, but we must never forget that nine-tenths of humanity are still in capitalist-controlled societies. The Soviet Union's population accounts for only one-tenth of the world's population. But we must pay attention to the fact that the capitalist world has recently been forced to make a few concessions. At the same time, after the Soviet Union merged West Ukraine and West Belarus, it has increased its land area and population, with a population increase of 13 million. We have great reason to celebrate with the people of the Soviet Union, that the Soviet Union's population has increased from 170 million to 183 million. Therefore, when comparing the development of capitalist countries and the Soviet Union, the results are enough to prove the degradation of the capitalist world. Lenin made a brilliant assessment when analyzing the highest stage of capitalism. He said that modern capitalism, in terms of all its achievements in the scope of material culture and technology, is old, parasitic, corrupt, and backward. In the past 25 years, Lenin and Marx's analysis of capitalism has been confirmed by countless practical, scientific, and theoretical evidence. Countless rotten wounds and malignant ulcers of capitalist society have been exposed. As for the October socialist revolution having made the collapse of the entire capitalist system a practical result, there is no need to repeat it."</p>
<h3 id="e24">Competing for Supremacy Like Madmen: Shouldering the Blame for Starting Wars <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The current situation reveals that the intrinsic power within capitalist societies has been almost entirely destroyed during its corrupting process. As a result, if wars are not launched or the adventurous actions of imperialism outward are not repeatedly taken, capitalism will not be able to continue. Although the ruling class possesses enormous wealth, capitalism still cannot guarantee a prosperous and stable life for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in capitalist countries. The more wealth the ruling class accumulates, the more frantically the imperialists compete for hegemony, and the more cruelly they treat all opponents. This is because they are prepared to sacrifice other nations and everything else in order to destroy their rivals, but only to the extent that it does not affect their hegemonic endeavors. Therefore, the old talk of the bourgeois leaders in the past, who recklessly declared that the First Imperialist War was the last war, has long been forgotten by us. On the other hand, the leaders of modern capitalist countries, especially the most powerful "Bevin" and "Attlee" groups and their running dogs, are doing their best to enhance their positions and trying to solve domestic difficult problems in the new imperialist war. They should bear the guilt for the war being waged today. They are trying to prolong the current war and continue to deceive the people, making them believe that they are fighting to defend democracy. Therefore, we can only draw the following conclusion: we cannot expect the leaders of modern capitalism and their "socialist running dogs" to automatically abandon war or give up inciting and expanding war. On the contrary, we expect that the wars being waged today in Europe and Asia will become a new international slaughter to preserve and consolidate the dominant position of the imperialist powers.</p>
<h3 id="e25">The Soviet Union Strives to End War, Greatly Increasing International Prestige <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Different from the above is the Soviet Union's peace policy and its efforts to eliminate war. Therefore, the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy not only conforms to the interests of us and our allies, but also aims at the happiness of all mankind in the world. The so-called human happiness does not refer to the ruling class of imperialist countries, but is aimed at the masses. In other words, this is not only a sacred obligation for the Soviet people to enhance the international prestige of the Soviet Union, but also the work of all countries that yearn for peace. Therefore, the prestige of Lenin, the father of the Soviet Union, and Stalin, the leader of the Soviet people, is not only respected by the people of all countries, but also admired and believed by people outside the Soviet Union. The names of Lenin and Stalin have given rise to a bright hope in every corner of the world, making them strive for peace and liberation from the shackles of capitalism.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Mentioning Economic Conditions, Progressing Rapidly <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Molotov then mentioned one aspect of the Soviet Union's domestic progress. Molotov pointed out that the current Soviet Union's economic development plan can enable the Soviet Union to surpass the top capitalist countries economically in a short period of time (ten or fifteen years). The industrial output from January to October this year has increased by 14.4%, and the heavy industry output has increased by 15%. This kind of industrial development not only surpasses last year's industrial output (last year's output increased by 12%), but also has progressed compared to the method of increasing 14% annually stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan. Regarding machinery manufacturing and the national defense industry, it has increased by 29%, that is, in terms of the national defense industry, it has also increased by 45%. The industrial labor rate increased by 11% last year, and this year it has increased by 17%. In other words, to increase extremely high industrial output, compared with last year, it only requires the same number or even fewer workers.</p>
<p>In addition, although agriculture is due to poor climate, it still has progress. The grain output actually reached 650 million poods, an increase of 11% compared to last year. Cotton output increased by 5%, flax increased by 16%, beet increased by 26%, and potatoes increased by 60%.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Cultural Standards are Improving, Cadres and Talents are Abundant <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the cultural progress of the Soviet Union, Molotov especially pointed out the progress and closeness of the various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. Molotov said that socialist culture contains revolutionary qualities, but we must never abandon the gains of past cultures. The Bolshevik Party will never forget blood ties. The Bolshevik Party will give importance to the glorious history of the Soviet people and the nationalities of all countries. True progress can only be obtained under socialism. At the same time, this kind of progress must be based on the past history and achievements of each country, and must show the true meaning of history, so as to obtain the glorious future of each country.</p>
<p>Molotov gave special mention to the increase of Soviet cadres and talents, and called it one of the greatest achievements of the Soviet Union. It is said that these cadres and talents have led the people of the whole country to work in factories and collective farms. The most outstanding representatives are the Stakhanovites. They have shown high-speed socialist work efficiency. The number of Stakhanovites has increased. They have new methods to increase work efficiency. The talents created by the Stakhanov movement have added a lot of strength to the Soviet Union, and this movement is still in full swing. At present, more workers and collective farmers are participating in this movement. The desire for knowledge of young people and even children has increased. Their motivation is to become useful Soviet citizens. Among the laboring people in the Soviet Union, there are also strong cultural and artistic demands.</p>

<p>As for Soviet patriotism, it also has a solid foundation. This kind of patriotic thought is now deeply rooted in the minds of the Soviet Red Army and the people. "Soviet patriotism has created miracles on the border of Lake Hassan and Mongolia and Manchuria." When the Red Army entered Ukraine and western Belarus, its infantry marched 60 to 70 kilometers a day, also overflowing with this kind of patriotic spirit. The Soviet patriotic ambition is to recognize the motherland as one with communism. All of this shows that the Soviet Union not only has modern industry and collective farms as its main bases, but also hundreds of millions of new Soviet people, full of a socialist attitude, people engaged in work and study, and people who create glorious achievements for the common interests of their own country and the people of the world under the encouragement of patriotic sentiments.</p>
<p>Molotov pointed out that one of the main tasks of domestic policy is the communist education of workers, peasants, staff, and intellectuals, and to step up the training of Soviet intellectuals, so that their cultural standards exceed everything and are thoroughly loyal to the people and anti-socialist countries.</p>
<p>Molotov then said, "If our domestic policy neglects the enemies of the people and is tolerant, then it is a crime against the people."</p>

<p>Molotov also mentioned the upcoming local Soviet elections, saying that a total of 1.3 million representatives should be elected from the Soviets of the entire Soviet Union, which is even more than the population of a certain ten countries in Europe. Molotov firmly believes that this election will once again confirm the unity of Soviet society in supporting the Party and the government, and the moral and political unity of Stalin.</p>

<p>Molotov continued, "Regarding foreign policy, I don't need to add more details. I have explained it in detail at the plenary session of the Supreme Soviet a few days ago. However, I must mention the events and lessons that occurred in the past because we underestimated the environment in which our country was surrounded by capitalist countries. We all know that the enemies of the people, Trotskyites, and Bukharinites, foreign spies, who have now been swept away, attempted to use the above facts to betray our Soviet country and cede the Primorsky Krai, Ukraine, the Transcaucasus, Central Asia, and Soviet Belarus to capitalist countries. This sinister conspiracy, because our people have a deep faith in the common cause, because the Bolshevik Party is astute and capable, and because our country, under the guidance of Comrade Stalin, has already failed. The Soviet Union has never wavered, but has become stronger, and has further expanded its territory. It is even more invincible to the enemy, and even closer to the people of our country and loyal friends all over the world. We are not only satisfied with the success of our domestic policy, but also with the success of our foreign policy. The capitalist world is now gradually realizing that the Soviet Union is not to be trifled with, and that it can never be as they wish. They hope that our country's national strength will be weakened and obey foreign pressure, but the result is the opposite. The Soviet Union is unified, powerful, and as stable as a rock. This is because we have devoted our efforts to the security of the country and the enhancement of national defense this year. We have therefore made no small material sacrifices, but we have obtained the security guarantee of the people of the whole country as a reward."</p>

<p>"We cannot predict the difficulties of the future in diplomacy, but we deeply know that we must constantly enhance the strength of national defense. Since the Bolshevik policy has guaranteed the infinite enhancement of our domestic strength, we have nothing to fear from the difficulties of diplomacy. Our domestic strength is powerful and endless, and as the years increase, our enemies will have to admit this undeniable fact." "However, our country's best foreign policy is still the peace policy that has been tested and has had many successes. We must continue to promote it in domestic and foreign affairs. We all know that this is the will of the people of the whole country under the inspiration of the Party of Lenin and Stalin."</p>
<p>"We are now entering the 23rd anniversary of the October Revolution. We will move forward along the reliable Leninist line that has been tested for 22 years. This is the line that leads us to the final victory of the Soviet regime." (TASS Telegram on the 7th)</p>

<p>Berlin [omission] The German government issued a communique stating that, based on documents found in the British planes shot down by Germany, British preparations for war against Germany date back to 1936. The documents are maps of Germany designating bombing targets drawn according to the situation in 1936. Today, German newspapers have reproduced them. The official report also raised three questions to Britain: (1) While Britain is talking about maintaining peace and upholding the sanctity of treaties, why is it secretly carrying out espionage in Germany and mapping aeronautical charts, with not only military targets but even densely populated industrial centers as bombing targets? (2) Why did the British government propose to Germany to conclude an air force treaty and abolish air force bombing between 1935 and 1936, while at the same time planning and preparing to bomb Germany? (3) The British government has repeatedly expressed its desire for peace to Germany and the world, but in fact, it is actively preparing for war, and even planning to completely eliminate the German nation. Apart from the double policy and extending the preparation period to wait for the completion of the armament plan, how will Britain justify itself? In short, Britain's deliberate preparation for war as early as 1936 is already obvious. (Haitong Telegram on the 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e46">The Japanese Army Plans to Invade Southern Guangdong with Increasing Urgency; Japanese Planes Bomb Various Areas of Southern Guangdong Daily; Japanese Warships Also Target the Coasts of Qinzhou, Lianzhou, and Beihai <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: The Japanese army in Guangzhou has been attempting to invade Guangdong for years, repeatedly trying to break through the North and West Rivers, but they have been unsuccessful. Even after expending great effort to seize Bao'an and Zhongshan, they could not hold them for long. Currently, the Japanese army in Bao'an is only holding onto a corner of Shenzhen and Nantou, while the Japanese army in Zhongshan has not been seen harassing Shiqi again. Based on recent Japanese military movements, it appears that the Japanese army intends to invade Southern Guangdong again, with the aim of seizing Guangxi province. Since the middle of last month, the Japanese army has been increasing its air force strength at the Weizhou Island and Hainan Island airfields, and has assembled over a hundred Japanese planes at these two locations. Additionally, a small Japanese aircraft carrier is constantly anchored in the waters near Weizhou Island. Every day, seven or eight Japanese planes are dispatched in batches from the seaplane and land airfields, first scouting the counties of Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Fangcheng, and the Leizhou Peninsula. When they encounter densely populated areas, they assume them to be locations where Chinese troops are stationed, and indiscriminately drop bombs or fire downwards. Schools and institutions are particularly targeted. After the Japanese planes wreak havoc in Southern Guangdong, they typically fly over Guangxi province, such as Liuzhou, Yulin, Guixian, and Nanning (the Japanese planes bombing Guilin and Wuzhou depart from the West River area). The losses have been significant. After bombing Guangxi, the Japanese planes divide into teams and fly over Qinzhou and Lianzhou, then head out to sea. Therefore, the Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Gaozhou, and Leizhou areas are under air raid alerts almost every day, except when the weather changes. Last month, the 18th was particularly serious, with the county town of Lingshan being heavily bombed with over twenty bombs, destroying dozens of houses. On the 20th, four bombs fell on Beihai, destroying the Beihai French Church. On the 21st, the Lianbei Highway was attacked again, destroying civilian houses in the Gantiti area. On the 22nd, a team of Japanese planes attacked Beihai, dropping bombs in Tangzai Village, and then flew to Fangcheng, dropping more bombs.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, twenty Japanese warships suddenly appeared on the sea of Southern Guangdong. Another giant Japanese warship, resembling a command ship, was anchored on the sea off Beihai, with several cruisers guarding it. Additionally, six or seven shallow-water warships were stationed in the areas of Guantou Ridge, Hongsha Bay, Wulong, Bailongwei, and Qisha in Fangcheng. Furthermore, Japanese warships were sighted in Sanniang Bay and Longmen Port in Qin County. On the 22nd of last month, Hongsha Bay in Fangcheng was suddenly bombarded by Japanese cruisers, covering the landing of Japanese soldiers from Japanese boats, who looted food. They were later repelled by local forces. Additionally, Japanese boats are surveying the waterways daily and setting up buoys along the coast. A few days ago, the navy even publicly declared that it would blockade Beihai. All fishing boats leaving the ports of Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Gaozhou, and Leizhou are chased and captured by Japanese warships as soon as they leave the port, drowning the people and setting fire to the boats. Countless fishermen have lost their lives and property. It is reported that over a dozen Japanese warships have also gathered outside the ports of Leizhou and Xuwen. The Japanese army has declared that the blockade plan for Qinzhou and Lianzhou has been completed. The defenses of Southern Guangdong have suddenly become tense, and rumors are rampant. Ships of all sizes in Qinzhou, Lianzhou, and Leizhou dare not go out to sea, and transportation has been cut off. Fish and seafood are no longer available in the market. Not only can civilian ships not export goods, but foreign merchant ships entering Beihai Port cannot unload cargo. On the 21st of last month, the British merchant ship Jiangsu, carrying cargo from Guangzhou Bay to Beihai, was suddenly inspected by Japanese ships when it entered the port on the 23rd, and was monitored, not allowed to unload cargo. By the 26th, the ship had been inspected several times, making it impossible for the ship to return. Finally, on the 26th, it left empty. It was inspected once more. The ship then sailed to Haiphong. Also on the 23rd, the British ship Hesheng, sailing from Hong Kong to Beihai, was threatened by Japanese warships on the sea off Guantou Ridge. It was only allowed to pass after stopping for inspection. On the 26th, three Japanese warships bombarded Longmen Port, but were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Jiading Dispatch: Thirty Japanese soldiers in Jiading, under the pretext of searching for guerrillas, took small steel cannons and heavy machine guns to Xinmu Bridge, four li outside the East Gate, a few days ago. They were surrounded by Chinese troops on all sides, and a fierce battle lasted for three or four hours. The Japanese army was eventually defeated and fled back to Jiading city. Only a dozen or so survivors remained. Since then, the Japanese army has kept the city gates tightly closed and has not left the city again.

<p>Suzhou Dispatch: The puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government relies solely on the plundering of over ten counties in Jiangnan to maintain itself, so its economy often feels exhausted. Recently, due to the lack of funds for puppet government and military expenses, and the fact that the subsidy from the puppet Ministry of Internal Affairs has not been allocated for several months, the puppet provincial government has had to downsize. On the first of this month, it issued a general order to all puppet county governments to lay off a large number of staff. At the same time, the puppet Pacification Army is also facing a shortage of funds, and starting this month, it is using a sham reorganization as a pretext to lay off a large number of officers and soldiers. Therefore, after receiving the puppet order, the puppet Pacification Commander here began laying off officers and soldiers from his troops on the 3rd. As the laid-off officers and soldiers have nowhere to live temporarily, they wander the streets all day, forcibly demanding food from the people.

<p>(Kunming News) Quentin Roosevelt, a graduate of Harvard University in the United States, in order to go to western China and Tibet and other places to find golden monkeys and other rare and exotic animals, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Japan last month, and then went to Hong Kong and transferred to Haiphong, and took a car to Kunming, and arrived in Yunnan and then entered Tibet via Dali to explore, and contributed the proceeds to the museums that funded the trip. What Roosevelt is concerned about is the golden monkey, which is produced in Tibet, Yunnan, and near Chengdu. He intends to capture one alive and bring it back to China. Although the giant panda is not Roosevelt's purpose, if the opportunity arises, he will do his best to capture it. Roosevelt stayed in Kunming for a few days and then went to Dali and entered Tibet from Lijiang. In addition to searching for rare and exotic animals, he will also study the customs of western China and collect information about animals, and can return to Shanghai at the end of December. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Roosevelt came to Shanghai with his mother and was quite familiar with the situation in China. The Jianghua Industrial School at 186 Baike Road is organized by alumni of Jiaotong University. On the morning of the 3rd, dozens of students from the school's civil engineering department, led by teacher Yan Chengjie, went to the corner of Kangnuot Road and Yanping Road to visit the construction project of the Holai Pharmaceutical Factory designed by engineer Li Jinpei.

<h3 id="e60">Finance: Foreign Banks and Hong Kong Gangs All Join in the Buying; Cash Falls Instead of Rising; Once Broke Through the 3,500 Yuan Mark <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market for cooked gold recovered slightly, and the sentiment was still good. The Hong Kong gangs and foreign firms were the most active buyers. Therefore, although the foreign exchange market had entered a state of fluctuation, the gold price eventually rose sharply. The process on that day initially opened with a fatigue of ten yuan, at 3,450 yuan. Later, due to the slight weakening of the exchange rate, it was pulled up by twenty yuan, which was why the gold dealers were actively buying. However, soon the exchange rate reported loosening, and the money changers competed to sell, and it fell to a low price of 3,410 yuan. Then, because foreign banks also entrusted securities firms to buy gold, the price returned to high, hovering between 3,430 and 3,450 yuan. Until the afternoon, the exchange rate continued to return to level, the gold dealers and Hong Kong gangs suddenly came to the market to purchase, and it soared to 3,505 yuan. After entering, cash and securities firms took the opportunity to sell high, so they stopped rising and fell. The result was a closing of 3,490 yuan in the evening, an increase of thirty yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day's trading was slightly clearer, about 1,200 to 1,300 taels. The jewelry gold in silver shops was listed for five yuan higher, and the customs gold was still flat.</p>
<p>Cooked Gold Rises by 30 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially opened flat and fatigued, the opening was done at a small ten yuan, and the money changers sold ten taels to the silver shop gang for 3,450 yuan. After the opening, a certain gold dealer actively bought on behalf of a customer, and for a time the sellers were on the sidelines, which immediately raised the price by two yuan. A certain gold dealer entered 20 taels from a securities firm for 3,470 yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange rate became strong, the situation became uncertain, and the sellers followed one after another. A certain money changer tended to sell out, and at the same time, there were quite a few retail investors who went short, so the decline was quite severe, and it fell sharply by 60 yuan. The money changer sold 20 taels to the remaining dealers for 3,410 yuan. After that, because the foreign exchange rate softened, securities firms and gold dealers rose again to buy, and soon a certain money changer also did not make up for the short position, so it returned high by 47 yuan. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the gold dealer for 3,457 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange rate was again reported to be soft and hard, and the securities firm and money changer came to sell, so it fell by 22 yuan. The money changer did 30 taels with each other for 3,435 yuan. At noon, because the buying intention of the securities firm emerged again, and at the same time, the foreign exchange rate also slightly recovered, it was seen to rise by 20 yuan. The securities firm entered 30 taels from the gold dealer for 3,455 yuan. Later, the silver shop gang sold out dozens of taels, so it dropped by a small five yuan, calculated to sell 10 taels to the securities firm for 3,450 yuan as the closing price at noon. In the afternoon, the trend turned firm, and the opening was ten yuan higher. The money changer entered 20 taels from the securities firm for 3,460 yuan, and then continued to rise by ten yuan. A certain silver shop entered 20 taels from the securities firm for 3,470 yuan, then returned a small five yuan, and the money changer sold 30 taels to the silver shop gang for 3,465 yuan. After this, the foreign exchange rate reported softening, and at the same time, a certain gold dealer and the Hong Kong gangs competed to buy in, although the securities firms and retail investors who had made a profit sold out, the positions were still felt to be in excess of supply, so it soared by 40 yuan, breaking through the 3,500 yuan mark. A certain gold dealer entered 30 taels from the money changer and 20 taels from the silver shop gang, both for 3,505 yuan. At that time, a certain money changer and cash dealer suddenly sold high, and the buyers turned less, and it immediately fell by 30 yuan. The money changer sold 10 taels to the securities firm for 3,475 yuan. After entering, the Hong Kong gangs and money changers came to absorb the supply and then pulled up by another 22 yuan. A certain money changer entered 20 taels from the securities firm for 3,497 yuan. When the closing was approaching, it slightly returned down, and the gold dealer sold 20 taels to the money changer for 3,490 yuan as the closing price in the evening. The result was a return of 30 yuan compared to the day before yesterday, with a fluctuation of 95 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash dealer's own brand gold was ten yuan higher than the cooked gold, and the purchase had to be reduced by more than twenty yuan. The current gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>The Jewelry Gold is Listed for Five Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The jewelry gold in silver shops was initially priced at 350 yuan per tael by Datonghang, but at 2:35 PM, it was listed for five yuan higher. Datonghang changed the listing to 355 yuan, the same as the new business, and the purchase had to be reduced by 15 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Foreign Exchange Turns into a State of Hovering - Some Hong Kong Traders Settle In, While the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank Ejects <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw the HSBC quotations remain unchanged. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, the turmoil had subsided, and the situation entered a hovering state. It seemed like a period of calm after the initial cessation of a major war, so the entire day saw a mix of tight and loose conditions. Merchants and speculators engaged in covering shorts and initiating new positions with varying degrees of enthusiasm. As a result, the market response was not strong. At the opening, overseas exchange rates for British and American currencies narrowed by 0.0225, leading to a familiar pattern of a stable British pound and a tight American dollar. Although there was a slight tightening after the opening, it was only temporary, and trading was minimal. Subsequently, textile firms and other suppliers took the lead in selling, resulting in a gradual hardening of the market. However, speculators, sensing an opportunity, quickly reversed course and began buying, and Hong Kong traders also participated in purchasing. As a result, the market softened rapidly. Ultimately, exporters and the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank engaged in aggressive selling, causing the market to harden again. By midday, trading gradually cleared, and the market stabilized. In the afternoon, as Hong Kong telegraphic transfers continued to flow in, although the Japanese bank continued to release funds, strong buying interest persisted, causing the market to rally briefly to 5 4375 pence per dollar, and the US dollar re-entered the 9-yuan level, reaching 8.9375 yuan. By the close, the British pound had risen again to 5.46875 pence, while the US dollar remained at 8.9375 yuan, showing a 0.03125 loosening for the British pound and a 0.0625 tightening for the US dollar compared to the previous day. Fluctuations in the futures market remained tight, following the trend of the spot market. It was reported that a certain company had bought US$100,000 from the Japanese bank, the largest transaction of the day.</p>
<p>Market Fluctuations</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the London "big rate" and Bank of America rates were both stable. The price of raw gold in London remained unchanged. The exchange rate of British currency against the US dollar and against the French franc remained stable, while against Shanghai, it narrowed by 0.0125. The US dollar depreciated by 0.0225 against the British pound, fell by 0.03 against Shanghai, and fell by a small amount against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates for various currencies remained the same. At the bank's morning opening, the spot selling price for the British pound was 5 pence 0.375, and the US dollar was 8 yuan 0.6875, with the British pound remaining stable and the US dollar tightening by 0.03125 compared to the previous close, due to the fall in exchange rates. After the opening, the US dollar rate was quoted above 8.9375 yuan. Although the situation was slightly tight, it was only temporary. Before long, textile firms came to sell, and smaller foreign banks also dumped their holdings, causing the market to suddenly harden. Sales were made to HSBC, Chase Bank, and other banks, with spot British pounds at 5 and a half pence and 5.0625, and spot US dollars at 9.0625 yuan and 9.125 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged, and the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Subsequently, speculators, seeing HSBC's absorption, also came to buy slightly, and it was reported that Hong Kong telegraphic transfers also came to purchase at that time, causing the situation to soften. Purchases were made from foreign banks such as McCallum &amp; Co., with spot British pounds at 5 and a half pence, and spot US dollars at 9.0625 yuan and 9 yuan. Soon, the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank suddenly sold, and exporters also followed suit, causing the market to become tight again. Sales were made to foreign banks with spot British pounds at 5.053125 pence and 5.0625, and spot US dollars at 9.0625 yuan and 9.125 yuan. By midday, trading had cleared, and the market gradually stabilized. By the midday close, the bank's spot selling price for the British pound was 5.053125 pence, and the US dollar was 9.0625 yuan, with the British pound rising by 0.09375 and the US dollar also hardening by 0.09375 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>US Dollar Enters the 9-Yuan Level</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Hong Kong telegraphic transfers continued to buy in, although the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank again came to sell. However, British banks had a strong appetite for buying, so the underlying trend continued to soften. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers bought in spot British pounds at 5 and a half pence and 5.046875. Subsequently, foreign banks such as Lever Brothers absorbed the Japanese bank's spot US dollars at 9 yuan and 8.96875 yuan. Lever Brothers then absorbed the Japanese bank's current month US dollars at 8.9375 yuan. Later, the spot British pound softened to 5.04375 pence, and the US dollar to 8.9375 yuan. By the late close, the bank's spot selling price was 5.046875 pence for the British pound and 8.9375 yuan for the US dollar. The current month price was 5.0453125 pence for the British pound and 8.90625 yuan for the US dollar.

<p>Foreign Currency Hovering Upward - US Dollar Notes at 11.15 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was slightly stronger demand for foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, and market prices were firm and stable. The supply of British and American gold notes was scarce, and the number of buyers increased, causing market prices to rise. In the morning, it was 10.095 yuan. Later, as the US dollar tightened and customer absorption was frequent, market prices rose frequently. In the late market, it rose to 11.15 yuan. The supply of Hong Kong notes was not smooth, and the trend was also firm and popular. The absorption of French francs, Singapore dollars, Dutch guilders, and Annam piasters was stagnant. Moreover, since the foreign exchange rate had not fallen in the previous few days, they had fallen in line yesterday. Although the fluctuations were sluggish, the results were consistent.

<h3 id="e62">Securities - Bond Market Firm and Rising <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Securities in the gray market: Yesterday's market situation appeared to be slightly more stable, and trading was also slightly weaker. However, after a continuous decline, there was still no sign of a rebound. Although there were no significant highs and lows throughout the day, people's hearts were still uncertain and uneasy. There were many rumors in Nanjing, and most parties turned short. Moreover, retail investors covering shorts were not enthusiastic at all. It was said that textile firms and small financial institutions were selling off, so the sluggish trend had not yet passed. Moreover, on the surface, when major players sold slightly more, retail investors would definitely follow suit. The trend was still struggling powerlessly. Yesterday's course of events was firm with softness. Those raising prices saw that the selling pressure was slightly relaxed, but struggled to raise prices. The 11th issue abandoned the right to draw lots for Type D shares, and selling was very active, so market prices were still weak and listless. In the afternoon, the 20th issue father sold Type D shares, so it still could not rise. Yung Tai and Ta Feng still had selling, while Sheng Ta and Song Mao bought in. Both sides' entries and exits were not very strong. As a result, except for Type D shares, which continued to fall by 0.025 yuan, the rest were slightly better by 0.005 yuan to 0.02 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of the Cotton Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 41 yuan, with a slight increase of a few cents, it was said.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market in the Public Association was relatively quiet. The underlying trend was still firm, and trading was also active. Shares of the International Trust Company once rose to 9.4 yuan, and the closing price fell slightly. There were buyers at a price of 9.2 yuan. Shares of the Yangtze Bank Company showed a tendency to break through 9 yuan in the morning, but later returned to 8.8 yuan. Rui Rong shares traded tens of thousands of shares at a price of around 18 yuan. Shares of the Ewo Cotton Mill hovered between 22.45 yuan and 22.5 yuan, without much change.

<h3 id="e63">Cotton Yarn - Inventory Increasing, No Decrease - Cotton Yarn Market Under Heavy Pressure <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Cotton yarn industry colleagues' mentality is mostly bullish, but the actual digestion is poor, resulting in increasing inventory, no decrease. The oppression of the cotton yarn market is particularly heavy, so the stimulation of extending the bill of exchange is the second step, and the fundamental problem of consumption is the first. Therefore, although there are colleagues who buy in, the chips are slightly tight for a while and are expensive. Upon hearing that customer sales are not coming, they immediately fall. However, most current general traders are generally losing money, and they are unwilling to sell off due to huge losses. At the same time, the price of raw cotton is still firm, and the market's hovering power is stronger.</p>
<p>This morning, a certain trader took the opportunity to drag in dozens of bales of existing yarn. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 630 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan. Unexpectedly, although this price opened, actual sales remained unchanged throughout, and there were more sellers, and the trend became more relaxed, gradually returning to 623 yuan at the close, but there were still many sellers. It was found that 606 bales were traded in half a day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 1 yuan, Tian Nu fell by 4 yuan, and Double Earth fell by 5 yuan. The factory opened only 10 bales of 20-count special Jin Cheng yarn from the Yong An Factory, with a price of 636 yuan. Today, 70 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, and 100 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts bought by various gangs are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Colleagues 370 Inland 45</p>
<p>Ningbo 20 Hong Kong 50</p>
<p>Fujian 41 Quanzhou 20</p>

<h3 id="e64">Native Cotton Again Invaded by Foreign Cotton Sales After Foreign Exchange Steps Up, Converted Price Approaches <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Native cotton trading is ordinary. The Yong An Factory again handled 2,000 bales of Tonghua, with the price falling by 1 yuan compared to the previous day, to 131 yuan. Cash was sent to the factory. Other manufacturers were completely silent, so the cotton market's atmosphere was even more bleak. The general trend did not deviate from the image of hovering. Recently, the foreign exchange rate has gradually increased, causing the converted price of foreign cotton to approach. Various factories have begun to purchase, and the amount of orders is increasing day by day. The position of Chinese cotton has been encroached upon. As a result, the market situation has been constrained. The source of Su North cotton continues non-stop. 1,029 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, 757 bales of Changyinsha cotton arrived, and 670 bales of Beisha cotton arrived. The current situation of cotton is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Tonghua 131.0 Yong An 2,000 bales</p>
<p>Also 129.5 Colleagues 100 bales</p>
<p>Also 129.0 Also 200 bales</p>
<p>Changyinsha Packaged 136.0 Also 200 pieces</p>
<p>Another message: The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been particularly active recently. Both Chinese and Japanese factories have placed orders, and the number is not small. Yesterday, colleagues' purchases were also very lively, mostly long-fiber cotton, but they were mostly spot goods for immediate shipment. Because the number of American cotton that has already been loaded and shipped is too small, it has already been bought out. When the goods arrive, spot goods will be in short supply again.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was very firm early yesterday morning due to the purchase of speculators. The brisk sales of cloth caused spot trading, and trading in the Far East also showed signs of improvement. Later, because some bulls settled, the price of cotton fell due to the help, and the closing price fell by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, fell by one rupee, Egypt rose by more than ten pounds, and Liverpool rose by more than ten pence.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Grain - Monopoly and Hoarding - Keen Demand for Ke Xian <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Ke Xian market continued to surge yesterday. Because the inventory in Shanghai warehouses was weak, most Kejia people were hoarding goods, waiting quietly for the peak, resulting in few samples on the market. On the other hand, zero-bulk customers did not shrink back due to high prices, and searched intently, so they competed to raise prices, and took the lead as soon as possible. Therefore, 1,300 to 1,400 bags of market goods were sold out in an instant. Among them, Jiangbei Jianjing was the most popular, rising half a yuan at the opening, to 22.5 yuan. After that, it soared all the way, closing at 23 yuan, a sharp increase of more than one yuan compared to the previous market. Jingwu Jian also presented a show of color. The prices of Benjian, such as Luyang Jian, seemed to be cheaper, so there were inquiries, and the market price rebounded by about half a yuan.</p>
<p>Continuing arrival of 23 to 24 cars of Sujia Kuntai Fengqing goods to the market. Although it was heard that the Changbang goods were being shipped by wheel from Baimao Port and Hukou, but according to Xibang Kejia, the transfer certificate there was obstructed by the pseudo-government, and the rural areas there were in the active area of ​​the guerrillas, and it was still not easy. However, it was heard that they are working hard to dredge, and the goods may be seen in a few days. Yesterday, various Japonica rice sales were still stagnant in the morning. The price distance between Indica rice and Japonica rice was only three yuan. The standard was different, which was not enough. On the contrary, it aroused the enthusiasm of customers, and the market price rebounded by four to five jiao. Green Seed Kiln Seed Bai Ge and other new thin rice are weak and cannot be stored, so they lack showy colors. The Yinyuan Liquor Household Gang and the Rice Carrying route are still active and show a tightening trend. Xiangjing and Dongchun and other fancy varieties are also good.</p>
<p>Another message: Ke Xian has been digesting actively for days in a row. After the market price rose step by step, the market is no longer synchronized with Japonica rice. Yesterday, only the remaining Jiangbei Xian arrived in port, and there was also a lack of large quantities of Jingwu Xian shipped out. Moreover, yesterday's survey showed that Jiangbei Xian had only more than 9,000 bags in stock, and although Jingwu Xian had whole tickets stored in the eastern district, there were very few in the concessions. Yesterday, the merchants only directly distributed a small number, and formal wholesale was stopped again. Therefore, Jiangbei Xian first increased, and Wuxian continued to rise. It once rose by eight or nine jiao to more than one yuan in the morning. Later, Xingtun spit it out to stabilize. As a result, it was still eight or nine jiao higher, and Gao Ke Xian had risen to 23.3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Flour Market Clearly Determined and Secretly Loose Wheat Sources Still Stagnant <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: Even Japanese customers trade, all the same indifferent. Both the Southern and Northern Foreign Gangs intend to suppress the market and take the stock back. The local street is also reluctant to take on too much due to the high price, so people's hearts are weakened. Returned goods are even softer on the market. The new old warehouse sheet only opens 7.23 yuan and each offer another 5 or 6 fen, but the manufacturers' intention to sell is still not too accommodating, so the no.2 Flour Mill is still offered at 7.4 yuan. Customer sheets are still offered at 7.4 yuan and half to 4 jiao. The Paoche brand still requires 7.5 yuan. The total number of transactions is about 30,000 bags. It is feared that factory sheets may reduce small transactions possible. Investigate that 24,480 bags of wheat flour and 8,350 bags were shipped to Tanggu yesterday to Tianjin,</p>
<p>Wheat: There were not many sources yesterday. The newly arrived goods were mostly waiting in the warehouse to be sold. Since the hoarding households once searched for them the day before yesterday, the cargo side's intention to sell is even firmer, but the flour market has turned soft, and raw materials are also affected. As a result, the market is easier to rise than fall. Toshi from Fufu's and two factories handled 10,000 packages, and the market side did 7 cars, and the price continued to be tight.</p>

<p>The soybean sales market is not rising, and the market price is falling. The number of transactions is only 300 bags of Nanjing beans, (the price is detailed in the market price column), 150 bags of Taicang beans, 30 bags of Yangzhou beans, 65 bags of Wuhu beans, and 40 bags of Peidong Du beans. Sesame is as exhausted as ever, and export packages do not move. Stockpilers are seeking to sell, but there is no principal. Yesterday, only 10 packages of Yangzhou white sesame were made, and the price was 25 yuan.</p>
<p>150 bags of beans came from Beisha on the 7th, and 2,400 bags of beans, 50 pieces of raw oil and 814 cans were shipped to Hong Kong on the 8th.</p>

<p>The recent resumption of navigation in Wenzhou has enlivened the miscellaneous red dates, so the market situation has been invigorated. For example, the lowest price of Fuhong dates in the past was less than 20 yuan, and now the higher price has opened to 30 yuan. Wenzhou is also purchasing ordinary black dates, and the price has also improved. The current unified goods are 38 yuan to 40 yuan, and as high as 44 to 45 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign sugar slightly improved due to slightly tighter foreign exchange, but there were not many transactions. The association divided the existing cargo of crude white sugar by half a yuan, the stock arriving from foreign warehouses in June was 49 yuan, the stock arriving in July was 49.5 yuan, and Taikoo Car White was also slightly tighter. Dongzhan B mark was 53.5 yuan, HX mark was 50.1 yuan, H mark was 40 yuan, a small decrease of 1 yuan from the previous.

<p>People From All Walks of Life in Shanghai Sent Condolences</p>
<p>Fudan University, together with the Fudan Alumni Association, sent condolences to Lạng Sơn the day before yesterday. The telegram is recorded as follows: "Ma Yuzhang classmate in Lạng Sơn forwards to the whole family for a courtesy inspection. The mentor suddenly donated the pavilion, the mountains collapsed and the beams were broken, and the whole world grieved. I hereby extend my condolences, Shanghai Fudan University, Fudan High School Affiliated, Fudan Industrial High School, and the Fudan Alumni Association". Yesterday, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhu Kongjia, Yu Ziying, Shen Qinfang, Zhang Chongren, and other relatives and friends of Xiang Lao in Shanghai also sent a telegram to Lạng Sơn to mourn. The original text reads: "The family of Ma Xiangbo in Lạng Sơn is hereby inspected. The bad news has been received, and the shock and grief are indescribable. I hope that you will follow the changes and suppress your grief, and do not be too sad, so that the spirit of Xiang Lao in heaven can be more at ease".</p>
<p>Details of Death Still Unreported</p>
<p>According to Zhang Chongren, a famous painter who is Xiang Lao's great-grandson, Shanghai has not yet received a detailed report on Xiang Lao's death in Lạng Sơn, perhaps because there are only two women in the family, with few hands, and all affairs are busy, so they have no time for this. Three weeks ago (the 15th of last month), I received a letter from Lạng Sơn, but unfortunately it did not mention Xiang Lao's recent situation, but only earnestly instructed me on the etiquette that should be followed for my wedding and discussed family affairs. I express my gratitude to all sectors of Shanghai for preparing to hold a memorial service, and decided to attend the preparatory meeting held by various fellow countrymen's associations and charitable organizations at the Banking Club on Hong Kong Road at 3:00 p.m. today.</p>

<p>Dr. John Earl Baker, Secretary-General of the China International Famine Relief Commission and the Shanghai International Red Cross, has been in China for more than 20 years and has served as a consultant to the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Finance of the Chinese Government.

<h3 id="e74">Although the Portuguese Wheel Has Been Released, the Truth is Unknown Hua Mei and Other Companies Did Not Contact Each Other Beforehand <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Da Guangshe said that the three Portuguese wheels Tang Lu, Tang Qiao, and Tang Bei, which were detained by the US-owned Hua Mei Shipping Company, have been released by the Japanese Navy and will be moved to the No. 33 and 34 floats in front of the Power Plant the day before yesterday to prepare for repairs in the dock. According to inquiries from Hua Mei Company, although the three rounds have been released this time, the company does not know the truth about the negotiations, so it decided to send someone to inquire with the Portuguese consulate. After the Japanese Navy flags hanging on the wheels were removed, the Portuguese flags were also taken down at the same time, so the content also has twists and turns. According to the current situation, it will obviously take time to resume sailing. It is hoped that the crew members of the wheels who have returned to their籍will not come to Shanghai for the time being before the truth is clear and the sailing schedule is determined, so as to avoid wasting round-trip travel expenses and incurring unexpected losses. According to another message, seven Portuguese-籍 merchant wheels that were detained, Fulu, Fader, Meida, Libao, Feihe, and steamships Rude and Baode, have also been released by the Japanese side, but the companies have not contacted each other about this matter, so the situation after the release has become another problem.</p>

<p>Kato Gaiji returned to Japan in mid-September. On that day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs experienced a wave of resignations of all personnel in early October. When it was decided that Kagenuma Masayuki intended to resign, it was once rumored that Kato was expected to succeed him as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, Kagenuma decided to stay in office, and negotiations between the US, UK and Japan in Tokyo proceeded successively. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then sent Kato to Shanghai to hold talks with the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, and other third-country diplomats to exchange views on the current situation in China and conduct parallel negotiations with Tokyo. It was previously rumored that Kato would arrive in Shanghai from Kobe on the Taiyo Maru on October 29, but after arriving in Tokyo from Kyoto on the first of this month, he remained there. It is now learned that Kato took the Nagasaki Maru from Nagasaki at 10:00 AM yesterday and went directly to Shanghai, arriving in port this afternoon. Within this week, he will contact foreign envoys and consuls stationed in Shanghai. The issues to be discussed will focus on Japan's support for Wang Jingwei's "new regime" and the rights and interests of third countries in the Japanese-occupied areas, and the status of the Shanghai International Settlement is also included. This meeting will not be held in any formal manner. According to reliable sources, the two sides will frankly exchange opinions in regular contact.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Reports on the Purpose of This Visit</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that it learned this morning (7th) that when Kato, the Japanese special envoy to China, holds talks with US Consul General Gauss in Shanghai this week, he will only conduct preliminary discussions and exchange views on the situation in China. Kato is expected to arrive in Shanghai today, but it is not certain whether he will arrive by plane or ship. It is said this morning that the talks between the two US and Japanese officials in Shanghai are expected to focus on the establishment of Wang Jingwei's new regime and various issues related to the interests of third countries in the Japanese-occupied areas. This statement could not be confirmed this morning, but it is heard that these two points will be relevant to the discussion.</p>

<p>At 2:00 PM yesterday, more than 300 Japanese military police and puppet police suddenly set up posts on Yuyuan Road. From the Paramount to Edinburgh Road, a post was set up every ten steps. From the Edinburgh Road intersection to Zhaofeng Village, a post was set up every five steps. Every ten posts were guarded by a Japanese military policeman, all standing diagonally facing the sidewalks on both sides, with Edinburgh Road as the center.</p>
<p>Police Station Implements Special Precautions</p>
<p>The police station dispatched two red patrol cars, carrying a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives, to implement special precautions at the corners around the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Edinburgh Road. At that time, except for vehicles on Yuyuan Road, which could still pass, Edinburgh Road was blocked by barbed wire.</p>
<p>Traffic Interrupted for About Ten Minutes</p>
<p>At 2:15 PM, six cars, escorted by Japanese military police and puppet police in the front and rear, riding three motorcycles, sped from the east and stopped in front of Wang Jingwei's residence at No. 1136 Lane. Traffic was temporarily interrupted for about ten minutes.</p>
<p>Police Detectives Retreat at 3:00 PM</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet forces removed their posts at 2:45 PM, while the police detectives remained stationed until about 3:00 PM before retreating. The Japanese and puppet forces took this measure twice when Lieutenant General Yamada Otsuzo and Lieutenant General Itagaki Seishiro visited Wang. This was the third time. It is rumored that Oikawa visited Wang.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Economy and Disaster Relief Committee has been advocating economy and disaster relief since its establishment on Double Tenth Day in the 27th year [of the Republic]. It has also been urging people from all walks of life to pledge monthly regular donations and pay them to major banks in Shanghai for collection. The committee then remits the money to the Refugee Relief Association for distribution. After more than a year, the amount is nearly 100,000 yuan, and the results are excellent. Currently, the monthly pledges are still around 2,000 yuan. The association issued another announcement, saying that with the current increase in living expenses and the difficulty in providing for refugees, it hopes that all sectors will continue to recognize pledges and maintain consistency.

<h3 id="e79">Puppet Regime Attempts to Ban Import and Export of Legal Tender, Consular Corps Ignores It, Repeatedly Undermining the Rights and Interests of Third Countries, Disguised Tax Increase Threatens British and American Goods <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of September this year, the Jianghai Customs has been pressured by the Japanese to use the "Huaxing" puppet currency to implement disguised tax increases, hindering the import of European and American goods. Now it is attempting to take further measures to control trade. Yesterday, it was heard that Li Jiannan, the puppet supervisor of the Jianghai Customs sent by the puppet "Reformed Government", has sent a "formal notice" to the authorities of the consulates in Shanghai, stating that the Jianghai Customs will henceforth prohibit the import and export of legal tender. However, after receiving this "notice", the consular officials of various countries stationed in Shanghai ignored it, considering that it came from an unrecognized puppet organization. However, according to the observation of a commercial magnate in Shanghai, the puppet regime's move is a vain attempt to promote the "Huahe" puppet currency and has not given up. It will further harm the rights and interests of third countries. Since the Jianghai Customs used the puppet currency, the import of British and American goods has decreased sharply. The number of import declaration forms in the last month was only three or four hundred, only 30% of the same period last year, a sharp decrease of about 70%. This is not something that various third countries can sit idly by.</p>
<p>Attempt to Control Shanghai Customs Trade</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that it was learned this morning (7th) from reliable sources that Li Jiannan, the "Jianghai Customs Supervisor" appointed by the current "government" in Nanjing, is taking a further step to control the trade of the Jianghai Customs with "new" personnel, and has formally notified the heads of the consular offices of various countries in Shanghai that the Customs authorities will generally prohibit the continued import and export of legal tender.</p>
<p>Consular Officials Share Common Views</p>
<p>When reporters inquired with several consular officials, they refused to directly criticize this new regulation, but said that this move is related to the future stability of the local currency. It is noted that the "Reformed Government" issued similar plans in Nanjing several months ago. Although some felt that this regulation would also be implemented here, they did not expect it to be implemented at this time.</p>
<p>Shanghai Trade May Be Affected</p>
<p>According to a merchant in Shanghai, the new regulation will have some impact on the city's trade, especially since merchants will now find the legal tender market more "tightened" and have to use "Huahe" banknotes. The situation of "small coins" will continue to cause difficulties here, because the news that the Ministry of Finance is transporting about 500,000 yuan of one-cent and five-cent banknotes from Hong Kong to Shanghai only came out last week.</p>
<p>Customs Officials Also Remain Silent</p>
<p>When Jianghai Customs officials mentioned this matter this afternoon, they refused to disclose any details about the new regulation. When reporters asked whether the "Reformed Government" had decided on regulations to punish those who violated this new order, an official replied that no punishment regulations had been issued. Generally, any amount of legal tender found will be confiscated. As for whether those who violate the new regulations will be charged with a crime, the official refused to comment.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Xi Lun Departs Shanghai for Tibet to Participate in the Reincarnation Ceremony of the Dalai Lama, Taking a Road Through India to Lhasa, Investigating the Political Situation and Promoting German and Italian Interests <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Xi Lun, a member of the National Political Council, was previously ordered by the central government to go to Xikang for inspection. After completing the task, he returned to Chongqing to report. Now he is ordered again to go to Tibet as a consultant with Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, to participate in the coronation ceremony of the reincarnated Dalai Lama. Xi came to Shanghai a month ago to take care of family affairs. Having completed his tasks, he returned to Hong Kong the day before yesterday. The reporter met Xi on the ship and was told about the experience of being ordered to go to Tibet this time as follows:</p>
<p>Tibet's Orientation</p>
<p>Tibet is located on the frontier, and its transportation to the interior of China has always been extremely difficult. Therefore, all news is mostly isolated. Tibet is divided into the former and the later Tibet. The former Tibet is in charge of political and religious affairs by the Dalai Lama, who has great power. The later Tibet is mainly religious and is under the rule of the Panchen Lama. The central government has always been very concerned about the Tibetan people and has given the Panchen Lama great courtesy. Therefore, the Tibetan people have an extraordinary love for the central government. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the relocation of the national government to Chongqing, the Tibetan people's desire to be oriented towards the interior has become even stronger.</p>
<p>Dalai Lama's Reincarnation</p>
<p>After the death of the Panchen Lama, the central government sent a senior official, Huang Musong, to Tibet to express condolences. Later, the Dalai Lama of the former Tibet also passed away. The central government has tried its best to help with the issue of the Dalai Lama's reincarnation. Although it has been quite some time, three candidate child spirits to inherit the Dalai Lama have been found. As to which one is the true body of the Dalai Lama's reincarnation, it must be determined by a lottery ceremony based on the traditional religious rituals.</p>
<p>Special Envoy</p>
<p>In order to show its solemnity, the central government specially appointed Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, as the senior official to participate in the enthronement ceremony of the Dalai Lama. Wu departed from Chongqing for Hong Kong on the 2nd of this month. His entourage members were divided into two groups to go to Tibet. One group went to Tibet via the Sichuan-Tibet border because the mountain roads were rugged and traveling was difficult. The other group set off by sea to save time and money.</p>
<p>Route to Tibet</p>
<p>The time to enter Tibet by sea is shorter than by land. The journey is from Hong Kong, via Rangoon to Calcutta, India, and then directly to Darjeeling at the foot of the Himalayas, and then to Tibet by land to Lhasa. This time, the British government telegraphed the Indian government to provide all kinds of conveniences, which the central government greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Promoting German and Italian Interests</p>
<p>In addition to participating in the reincarnation ceremony of the 14th Dalai Lama, Wu will also promote the central government's benevolence and interests to the Tibetan people. At the same time, he will also investigate Tibet's political and religious facilities to seek further benefits for the entire Tibetan people, and under the leadership of President Chiang Kai-shek, become a strong link in national defense. The current political and religious leader of the former Tibet is the Regent Reting Hutuktu, who is extremely intelligent and capable and holds real power over both political and religious affairs and is deeply supported by the Tibetan people.</p>
<p>Golden Pagoda Burial</p>
<p>Since the death of the Dalai Lama, Reting Hutuktu has been in charge of Tibetan politics and has devoted himself to orientation towards the interior, requesting the central government to send senior officials to supervise the Dalai Lama's reincarnation to show solemnity. As for the leader of the later Tibet, he was originally the Panchen Lama. After the Panchen Lama's death, his remains must be escorted to Zhaxilhunbu in the future, where they will be buried in the golden pagoda for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Financial Circles Express Assistance in Establishing Grain Storage, Still Hoping for Efforts from All Sectors to Maintain Food Supply Within the Settlement <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that since Shanghai has become an "isolated island," the environment is special and it is not easy for citizens to live. In view of the high price of rice, which affects social order and security, the federation has suggested that the authorities of the two concessions, during this time of late rice harvest, set up grain storage to prepare for unforeseen needs. The French Municipal Council has already sent a letter expressing its approval, and the trade associations and rice industry also deeply hope to realize it. The Citizens' Federation has been in contact with various parties to prepare. At present, the rice market continues to be sluggish and unable to recover. Rice-producing areas have successively relaxed the ban and allowed rice to be transported to Shanghai for regulation. This matter is related to the livelihood of millions of citizens. Moreover, this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved individually. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially inquired with the financial circles in Shanghai yesterday about their opinions on the establishment of grain storage. The answer was as follows: Establishing grain storage is an urgent task. All citizens must contribute their opinions and assistance to promote its success. This matter is of great importance to the livelihood of five million citizens. The country is based on the people, and the people depend on food as their heaven. At this time when the War of Resistance Against Japan has not ended, it is an urgent plan. All of us in the financial circles are happy to provide assistance to facilitate turnover and large-scale procurement. It is heard that the French Municipal Council has expressed its approval and will find ways to proceed within its possible scope. However, we in the financial circles have not yet received a formal letter from the initiating party, so we will be happy to assist once we receive this letter, and we hope that all sectors will redouble their efforts to contribute to this good cause.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Japanese Erect Military Telephone on Avenue Edward VII, No Change in Police Affairs in District A, Houses on Guangfu Road Demolished <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>In front of the small Western-style house at No. 490 at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, four Japanese soldiers were erecting a military telephone line yesterday morning. Two of the Japanese soldiers also climbed onto the telephone pole in front of the Sankyo Machinery Western Firm at the other end. Passers-by all glanced at them sideways.</p>
<p>Police Affairs in District A</p>
<p>Two British soldiers are still stationed near the iron gate at the end of North Honan Road. One British soldier is also stationed on the side of the Qianjiang Guild Hall at the intersection of Hai Ning Road. Chinese police officers are guarding posts and directing traffic on Heng Ma Road such as Tiantong Road and Suzhou Road. Police officers from the Huishi Police Station are also still patrolling in District A, so there is no change in the police situation.</p>
<p>Demolishing Houses</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese have been carrying out large-scale construction in the Hongkou District. The building materials they need, such as bricks, tiles, wood, and stone, are all hired laborers to dismantle the uninhabited houses in the ruins of the Nanshi District. Starting yesterday, they resumed demolishing the houses on Guangfu Road in Zhabei, from the first warehouse of the "Inland Shipping Company" at the Sampan Factory New Bridge westward to the Kunji Pier. All the bricks and tiles were loaded onto trucks by Japanese soldiers and transported to Hongkou for use. Therefore, looking north from MacGuffin Road and Siku Angle, it has become a plain, and there is no trace of the previous war.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Mitsui Continues to Seize Eggs, British and American Consulates Actively Investigate, Will Lodge Strong Protest with Japan <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that British and American firms in Shanghai were purchasing eggs at the mouth of the Yangtze River and were previously forcibly seized by Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese firm. After negotiations, part of the seized eggs were returned. However, in recent days, Mitsui &amp; Co. has relapsed and again seized the eggs purchased by British and American firms. Mr. Hanawa, the manager of Mitsui &amp; Co. in Shanghai, seems to have read books about pirates and imitated their acts of robbery.</p>
<p>Robbery Behavior</p>
<p>It is investigated that the eggs purchased by British and American firms are forced to be loaded on Japanese ships for transportation, but the "Consignor" column on the bill of lading has recently been written with the words "Mitsui &amp; Co." The British and American firms had no other choice but to submit to it. Mitsui &amp; Co. then used this to seize the eggs and refused to return them to the legitimate owners. This morning (7th), it was heard that Mitsui &amp; Co. had resumed</p>
<p>Egg-Grabbing Strategy</p>
<p>Afterwards, the British and American consulates in Shanghai have actively launched investigations and will probably lodge a strong protest with the Japanese authorities. According to news received in Shanghai this morning, farmers in the Japanese-occupied areas, especially in the Wuxi area, are ordered to only sell eggs to the Japanese, and the price they receive is far lower than the price offered by British and American egg merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Puppet "City Government" Robs People Again, Puppet Taxes Emerge One After Another in Areas with Cross-Border Roads <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The "Continental Times" reported yesterday (6th) that according to informed sources, the puppet "City Government" has recently suffered a severe blow to its "municipal" budget because the Nanjing "Reformed Government" has stopped its monthly subsidy of 450,000 yuan. Therefore, it is making new attempts to make this budget "balance income and expenditure." The new tax revenue plan of the "Special City Government" includes special taxes on factories in the settlement.</p>
<p>Cross-Border Roads</p>
<p>Factories in the settlement. Industrial and commercial firms and funeral parlors are subject to special taxes. Although the puppet regime claims that these new taxes are part of the "business tax" plan, at least factories, business firms and funeral parlors have been selected as the first puppets of the plan for the time being. It is investigated that business firms and funeral parlors are products of this war. They only started operating in western Shanghai after the Chinese army abandoned the Shanghai district. The "Municipal Social Affairs Bureau" has repeatedly sent people to various factories to forcibly register and force factory owners to pay fees and change business licenses in order to obtain</p>
<p>Business License</p>
<p>Fees from industrial and commercial firms in areas outside the settlement. According to business circles in the western district, the work of the "Bureau" has now extended to Yuyuan Road and Jing'an Temple Road, but the puppet officials are sometimes driven out by factory owners, especially foreign factory owners.</p>

<p>Luo Ni, a Shaoxing woman residing at No. 18, Lane 653, Xin Zha Road, is 52 years old. Her youngest daughter, Luo Lin (also known as Ru Ling, nickname Sanbao), is 19 years old. After graduating from the junior high school of Qiu De Girls' School, she worked as a teacher in the kindergarten of Zhenxi Primary School on Dagulu Road. Whenever she had time after class, she would go to the park to take a leisurely look. Two months ago, Luo met</p>
<p>French Park</p>
<p>Pu Baojun (25 years old), a Nantao man wearing a Western-style suit in France park. They fell in love at first sight and exchanged affections. Pu claimed to be still single and willing to marry Luo. From then on, they were closely related, and their figures could be seen in the depths of the green shade from time to time. At first, Luo would go out early and return late to avoid her mother's eyes and ears. Then, she simply didn't return all night.</p>
<p>Deeply Fallen in Love</p>
<p>Recently, Luo Ni began to notice that her daughter's behavior was improper, so she strictly disciplined her and forbade her from going out. Until about 8:00 AM on the 28th of last month, Pu went to the outside of Luo's house to visit because he had not seen his lover for many days. Luo, with her love for her, disregarded everything and followed Hong Fu's elopement. From then on, she did not return home for several nights. Until the day before yesterday, she received a letter from Pu, generally saying that her daughter had a deep feeling for him.</p>
<p>Living Together</p>
<p>However, he would never abandon her in the future, otherwise he would be willing to compensate for the loss of 10,000 yuan. After receiving the letter, Luo reported to the Xin Zha Police Station and sent Detective Yang Peizhang to the gate of Zhenxi Primary School to arrest Pu. He quickly took Luo to the police station together. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for the crime of obstructing marriage under Article 240 of the Criminal Law and presented the case. Then Luo Lin confessed that she was already 21 years old and had</p>
<p>Marriage Autonomy</p>
<p>Right. This time, she ran away automatically and lived with Pu at No. 29, Hole 12, Rue Conty, French Concession. Now she does not want to go home. According to Luo Ni, her daughter is only 19 years old and she presented a graduation certificate from Qiu De School as proof. When questioned, the defendant Pu Baojun, Wu Ren seduced and admitted to living together. The court argued that the defendant should be detained for seven days for another hearing, and Luo was temporarily sent to Jiliang Institute.</p>

<p>The French Concession Police received a tip-off yesterday morning that a large-scale drug trafficking operation was secretly established inside No. 15, Hengmao Lane, Mintiniyin Road. The organization was extremely tight and the scale was huge, as if they had nothing to fear. The ringleader was even more arrogant, openly selling drugs and using cars as if they were wealthy merchants, relying on some kind of hidden power. Upon receiving the report, the police immediately ordered Detective Shen Jinshu to lead detectives Zhong Benchang, Zhou Xuewen, Jiang Zhongjia, and others to the address for a secret raid. After the detectives forced their way in, they successfully cracked down on the operation, seizing several pounds of morphine worth a fortune on the spot and arresting several suspects. They were immediately taken back to the police station. Based on their confessions, accomplices were subsequently apprehended in other locations, totaling as many as sixty-four people.

He died on the spot before he could be rescued.</p>
<p>Thugs Arrive and Strangle Woman</p>
<p>Lin Abing, a 41-year-old local, lived in a workshop at No. 5, Xinchang Lane, Route Ghisi, West Shanghai. Yesterday morning, before dawn, three thugs carrying pistols and sharp blades suddenly broke in. They immediately grabbed Lin's wife and strangled her to death with a rope. At the time, Lin, fearing the weapons held by the intruders, did not dare to speak out and watched them leave after they had finished.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Rickshaws Banned on Middle Section of Avenue Edward VII; Residents Express Inconvenience <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaws have recently been banned from the section of Avenue Edward VII from Chengdu Road to Datong Road. Initially, this was for road construction, and all vehicles could pass as usual, except for rickshaws. After the road was repaired and reopened, the restriction was reimposed. Sometimes rickshaws were only allowed to travel from east to west or from west to east, and sometimes they could travel in both directions. However, in recent days, rickshaws have been prohibited from passing on this section of the road during the day, regardless of whether they are coming from the east or the west. As a result, pedestrians traveling on this section of the road and residents and shops in the area find it impossible to hire rickshaws to get around or small carts to transport goods, causing great inconvenience. Even if the section of Avenue Edward VII near the Chengdu Road intersection has not yet been widened, and there is sometimes congestion, the city should regulate traffic as one-way only during the busiest times of the day, allowing all vehicles to pass, rather than uniquely restricting rickshaws, which causes inconvenience to shops and residents.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news item in the local news section of your newspaper titled "Elderly and Seriously Ill, Medical Treatment Ineffective," this is not in accordance with the facts. Here is the correction: Yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM, five people (four men and one woman), whose names were unknown, brought a seriously ill patient surnamed Zhang to the hospital for treatment. After my diagnosis, I determined that the patient was suffering from bronchial asthma, and the pulse had ceased. The patient was unable to speak and only had deep, labored breathing, indicating a state of collapse beyond rescue. I ordered them to take the patient out. However, the patient's family repeatedly begged for a cardiotonic injection to see what would happen. I immediately administered an injection of Camphonasin and instructed them to take the patient home to rest quietly. However, as they carried the patient to the door, the patient's landlord intervened, saying that such a seriously ill person could not be taken back and could only die in the hospital. The patient was left in a situation with no way forward or backward. Seeing this, I felt sympathy and ordered the patient to return to the ward to rest quietly on the sofa while instructing the family to find a place to live. However, by around 1:00 PM, there was no improvement, and the patient died. I reported the matter to the police, and the body was examined, and the case was closed. This is the true sequence of events.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Gu Dai, Director of Huaide Hospital</p>

<h3 id="e97">Visiting Schools for the Blind and Deaf-Mute <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>In our class, our English textbook is the autobiography of Helen Keller, the world-renowned blind and deaf woman. After reading it, our American English teacher, Miss McDun, suggested to us, "Would you like to visit the Shanghai School for the Blind?" Everyone in the class agreed. Miss McDun wrote a letter to Mr. G.B. Fryer, the principal of the School for the Blind, to seek his consent, and Mr. Fryer replied welcoming us to visit.</p>
<p>Before the war, the School for the Blind was located on Hongqiao Road, but after the war, it moved to 37B, Route Tenant de May, West Shanghai, behind the Tongren Refugee Hospital, and continued to operate. That afternoon, to avoid attracting attention, we decided to set off separately.</p>
<p>That day, Principal Fryer personally came to receive us and told us about the founding and history of the School for the Blind. Mr. Fryer was getting on in years, with a full head of white hair, but he was full of energy, and his Mandarin was also very fluent.</p>
<p>According to him, a Frenchman first founded a school for the blind in France in 1790, and it gradually spread to Europe, America, and other parts of the world. According to statistics, there are a total of six million blind people in the world, and China alone has one million blind people, a ratio of six to one. The reason why there are so many blind people in China is that the general public lacks common knowledge about protecting their eyes. There are more than 30 schools for the blind in China, but since the war, many have closed due to various reasons. Later, Mr. Fryer also gave a detailed account of the methods of speech for the deaf-mute. It can be roughly divided into four points: (1) teaching how to pronounce; (2) watching the movements of the teacher's mouth; (3) the method of writing; (4) the movements of the hands. After Mr. Fryer spoke, two teachers led us to visit the classrooms.</p>
<p>The blind and the deaf-mute are together, the deaf-mute school is downstairs, and the school for the blind is upstairs. We first visited the school for the deaf-mute. In one classroom, there were many students who could not speak, but now they could say some single-syllable words, but it was not very fluent, and we could not understand it very well. According to the teacher, it is quite difficult to teach a deaf-mute person to speak because the deaf-mute person has not been able to use their vocal organs since childhood. In the second classroom, there were older students, said to be in the fifth grade. The teacher was also a deaf-mute person. He used gestures to tell them a sentence, and then asked a student to write it on the blackboard, both in Chinese and English, and the pronunciation was much more fluent. On the walls of the corridor outside the classroom were hung many pictures drawn by the students. One of the pictures showed an old man with hair half a foot long, and that was Dr. Fryer, the founder of the school for the deaf-mute. After the visit to the school for the deaf-mute, we went up the stairs to the School for the Blind. First, we were led to a room where six or seven lovely children were standing, their faces as red as apples, but unfortunately, their eyes were deeply sunken, they were blind. They sang a song for us. In another room, there were older students, both male and female, with several of their textbooks on the table. In our opinion, those textbooks were very special, with small holes one by one on the paper. A blind child read an English story to us by touching it with his hand. Finally, we were led to a music room, where a blind child of about twenty years old gave a piano solo.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to talk about the economic problems of the School for the Blind and the School for the Deaf-Mute. The School for the Blind has its own foundation to assist it, but the School for the Deaf-Mute does not, relying solely on the tuition income of the students to maintain it. According to them, they are afraid that they will have to move soon. We often think that blind and deaf-mute people are beyond help. From the visit that day, the facts tell us that blind and deaf-mute people can not only be helped but can also excel. I hope that people in society will support these kinds of schools more, because this is not only a matter of the happiness of blind and deaf-mute individuals but also the creation of more talent for the country.</p>
<h3 id="e98">At the Intersection of Shanxi Road, Respectfully Submitted from Tianjin <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Zun Bin, from Tianjin</p>
<p>The British Concession in Tianjin is tightly sealed, almost suffocating. Except for Shanxi Road, the boundaries at all other intersections are winding with electric fences. Therefore, the two sides of Shanxi Road are much more lively than before. The noodle stalls, pancake stalls, beef stalls... are specifically catering to the hunger of those waiting to be inspected because waiting for two or three hours or half a day for inspection is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The middle section of the road is separated by wooden fences with five passages, the central one being larger for automobiles and other heavy vehicles, and two passages on each side so that vehicles and pedestrians can follow their respective designated routes. Next to the wooden fences is a small house built of wooden boards, with a total of three rooms, the middle one being a prison cell. Those who violate the rules are imprisoned, and some even experience inexplicable beatings.</p>
<p>Every day, one can hear various novel stories of unfortunate individuals at this checkpoint. The following is a scene I witnessed:</p>
<p>"Unbutton your coat!" the puppet police shouted.</p>
<p>"Yes! Sir!" a compatriot replied politely.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" the puppet police asked sternly, staring.</p>
<p>"Home," he smiled, but couldn't hide the trembling fear in his expression.</p>
<p>"What do you do!"</p>
<p>"I'm a regular employee at a dry cleaning company," he replied very amiably.</p>
<p>The puppet police's hands incessantly checked him, groping around everywhere, unwilling to let go of anything. Suddenly, he pulled a banknote from the corner of his clothes:</p>
<p>"Huh! Hidden in such a secret place! Don't move! Arrest him!" he said self-importantly, defending his actions.</p>
<p>"No... Sir... because my family is waiting to use it... Sir!..." His face turned from white to blue, his lips quivering, almost unable to speak.</p>
<p>"Huh! Still pretending! Chinese banknotes are forbidden! Do you know that? Huh! Arrest him!" Saying that, he put the banknote into his own pocket.</p>
<p>He wanted to say something in protest, but he had already been dragged into the prison cell.</p>

<p>Chapter 17: Learning Outdoor Affairs in a New Field of Journalism, Practicing Indoor Affairs in a Small School Playground</p>
<p>Wu Junsu is a person who likes to make friends the most. As for sisters, as long as the talk is speculative, it only takes a day or two to feel very familiar. It's like the two Miss He's. Just because it was their first time coming to Suzhou, and they were in the same car with Wu Junsu, Jin Danyun entrusted her to take care of them at any time. She felt that the He sisters were congenial and very close. Also, because Zhu Airen was also a familiar acquaintance, the last time Dongwu University put on a play, she invited them to see the play and acted as a host. She and the He sisters had a feeling of regretting that they had not met sooner. But it is not only for Shuangyu and Liyu, but also for other sisters who have similar interests. Moreover, she is amiable and approachable, and people are willing to make friends with her. It is also good that the place where she lives is in Suzhou, close to the school, and the address is also very quiet. Suzhou is also a road that is often passed through, and the sisters who are familiar with her will visit her by the way. She is also a hospitable person. There are only two sisters in the house. If friends delay for a day or two, she can sleep together and talk all night. Otherwise, at least keep a meal to show her diligence. Shao Huihua is also Wu Junsu's favorite classmate sister. She always visits Wu Junsu when she passes by Suzhou. Wu Junsu always keeps her and doesn't let her go. Because Shao Huihua has too many fresh stories in her stomach, Wu Junsu said, "I want to keep her for a long night of ten days of talk." Shao Huihua said, "Don't say anything about ten days of talk. If I want to talk, I'm afraid I won't be able to finish talking for a year. If you want to write a novel, I can provide you with a lot of materials, just organize them yourself." Shao Huihua and Jin Danyun are also very close, because Yu Danyun has many foreign friends, and she often asks Danyun to introduce her when she visits. Once, when Danyun and Lin Jiancheng got married, she naturally came to eat wedding wine. A few days ago, she received an order from the museum to send her to Fujian on official business. At that time, a railway from Zhejiang to Fujian was recently held for a traffic opening ceremony. There is also a civil aircraft field in a certain county along the coast of Fujian that held a completion ceremony. Airplanes from all provinces flew to congratulate them. There is also one thing, a very large sugar factory in Fujian held an opening ceremony. This sugar factory was opened by overseas Chinese in the South Seas Islands in Fujian and is very large in scale. These three things were crowded together, so the museum had to send a special correspondent. On the day of the completion ceremony of that civil aircraft field, they knew that Miss Shao Huihua could fly an airplane, and they also invited her to drive an airplane and made various flowers in the dog sky, and the formula flight taught many viewers to applaud and praise endlessly.

<p>— Wu Xiuqing</p>
<p>(1) Such a valuable exhibition, with a duration of ten days, is too short. It would be best to extend it for a few days to avoid crowding and allow visitors to view it leisurely.</p>
<p>(2) Preferential tickets should not be limited to students or school groups. Everyone should have the opportunity to visit.</p>
<p>(3) It would be best to have a permanent arrangement to display these items related to language, so that scholars can have the opportunity to refer to them at any time and have a deeper understanding of the national language. If there is no large area to display them, it may be possible to rotate them daily.</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Method of Filming Panchromatic Films <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Competition</p>
<p>Panchromatic films have achieved considerable success in recent years, with many films being produced by various companies. The splendid and vibrant colors often provide the audience with a sense of beauty. But how are these films made? I'm afraid many people would like to know.</p>
<p>When shooting with a panchromatic camera, the lens first absorbs the light, which then passes through a prism to separate the red, green, and blue primary colors into separate bands of light. These are then projected onto three pieces of film with different sensitivities. After chemical processing, the images are dyed, completing the preliminary work for the panchromatic film.</p>
<p>Inside the camera are three pieces of film. One faces the lens directly, while the other two are placed side-by-side on the left side of the light box, forming a ninety-degree angle with the lens. There is also a prism glass sprinkled with tiny golden dots, placed diagonally in the box, forming a forty-five-degree angle with the lens.</p>
<p>During the filming process: light passes through the lens and enters the camera. Part of the light passes through the prism and is projected onto the film coated with a green emulsion on the front. The remaining light is blocked by the prism and refracted onto the two side-by-side films. This refracted light passes through a red filter (which only allows red and blue bands to pass through) and is projected onto the two connected films. One of these films, coated with a yellow emulsion, retains the blue band and imprints its image, while the red band passes through and imprints its image on the film behind it. Thus, the same scene is filmed onto three different negatives. In these three negatives, the green one captures the shadows converted from the green parts of the scene in black and white. At the same time, the red and blue films each retain their respective colors and the images formed by the film's ability to perceive color intensity. In other words, these negatives are "master negatives." The coloring of each "master negative" is limited to the prominent parts of the image it captures (i.e., all the original light and shadows absorbed by the lens). When these three films are printed onto a "child film," the result is a "panchromatic film."</p>
<p>This is, of course, a very simple report, only outlining the general idea. Panchromatic films have not yet been produced in China. I hope that the film industry will be able to successfully produce a beautiful color film in the near future.</p>
<p>A Record of a Private Performance at the Yin Residence</p>
<p>November 5th of the Gregorian calendar was the day of Mr. Yin of the Yili Tobacco Company's renewal of marital vows. A banquet was held at the Continental Hotel. The members of the Feng Society, being old friends with the host, mobilized all its members to respectfully present a series of Peking Opera performances at the celebration. The performance began at 5:00 PM with the play "Performing Good Deeds Brings Sons." Mr. Chen Ziming's role as the rich man was natural and unconstrained in his singing and acting. The famous actress Liu Huiqin played his wife, adding much to the performance. Mr. He Qin'an's "Striking Yan Song" featured the Qipai style of singing (performed with a certain huskiness), delivered authentically, and without affectation, it had the full flavor of Qipai. Wang Xiaoshui's "Opera Phoenix" was handsome and dashing in appearance, with a wide and sweet voice. His acting was lively and detailed. Liu Huiqin played Fengjie again, making them a perfect match. Shen Yongliang and Sun Yixiang, an old duo, sang "Empty City Stratagem" without missing a single detail. Cao Maoru's "Caoqiao Pass" showed progress in stage movements compared to before, but he still could not avoid forgetting lines. The first play of the evening performance was Mr. Xu Zhaogan's "Woman Escorted." Except for a slight flaw in the "Fan Erhuang" aria, the rest was flawless. Chong Gongdao, from who knows where, kept eating snails and trying to make witty remarks, his effort to be clever only ended up awkward. Following was Chen Juehuan's "Catching and Releasing Cao." Although his voice was not bright, his pronunciation was very careful and his singing style was rich in flavor, making it very pleasing. His appearance was dignified and refined, and his physique was well-suited to the role. With such talent, and with hard work, in two or three years, he may become a leading male performer in Shanghai. Mr. Ma Baogang, a famous teacher, played Cao Cao. Mr. Yu Xucun played Lü Boshe. Their performances were very brilliant. The final performance was "Visiting Mother," featuring the famous amateur Zirui Lin as the Fourth Son, Liu Zhiao as the Former Fourth Son, Miss Yu Yiyun as the Princess, Xu Zhaogan as Zongbao, Qi Da'an as the Sixth Son, and Jin Dongsheng as the Empress Dowager. Some excelled in singing and acting, while others were known for their recitations. It was a perfect collaboration. The performance ended and the audience dispersed after 11:00 PM. ·Yu Chang·</p>
<h3 id="e103">My Performance of Improved Peking Opera <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Sulian</p>
<p>I have been learning opera since I was fourteen years old, so it has been almost eight years. At the beginning, I simply didn't know why I was performing. I was simply doing it with a passion for love and a strong interest. It was only in recent years, after coming into contact with people from all walks of life, that I often had the opportunity to discuss the issue of drama. I began to realize the true nature of drama. Undeniably, it was only then that I realized that performing and singing opera was not just for entertainment. Drama itself has the significance of "criticizing life; expressing life; guiding life." When I sing opera on stage, and perform the joys and sorrows of human life, I am one of the people who puts this into effect.</p>
<p>"As for the improvement of Peking Opera, I once performed in a short play with Mr. Zhou Xinfang at the Carlton. At that time, due to various restrictions, it was only a partial reform. However, I already felt that it had a different meaning from singing opera before. It was more thorough and made me more excited.</p>
<p>"I believe that the improvement of Peking Opera is a very difficult and important task, and it cannot be undertaken by a small number of people. Furthermore, it cannot be suddenly changed in a short period of time. I know that we need to get help and sympathy from all sides, especially that playwrights should give more help to us performers. In the past, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian specialized in adapting old plays, giving great convenience to those who performed improved Peking Opera. He is truly a great contributor to the improvement of Peking Opera.</p>
<p>"Singing opera should not only be regarded as a profession, just to make a living, but also as a career, a meaningful and purposeful career. Therefore, it is not easy to see results without dedicating one's life to this career. My performance of improved Peking Opera in Xindu this time is with this viewpoint. I deeply accept the guidance and help from all parties."</p>
<h3 id="e104">Anecdotes from the Pear Garden <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Discord of Old Male and Female Roles</p>
<p>For many years, so-called famous male singers have been praised if they can use a sorrowful tone in the "Calling Little Bandit" aria from the play "Visiting Mother," and listeners would be amazed and consider it rare and valuable. In fact, this kind of sorrowful tone is the most common and easiest to perform. However, relying on the sorrowful "Erhuang" tone in the male opera "Battle of Taiping" and the old female role opera "Mulan Saves Her Mother," is not only shorter than "Calling Little Bandit", but requires the singer to use a long note within the sorrowful tone. Performers without sufficient vocal resources would see this as a perilous path and would never dare to attempt it rashly. When Fu Ying came to the South several years ago, he was unsuccessful. The audience below the stage was also indifferent to his skills. It was not until his voice improved in recent years and he learned the play "Battle of Taiping" that he was warmly welcomed by customers, whether he performed in Beijing or Shanghai. It is said that his current earnings are three or four times higher than they were five years ago. In fact, "Battle of Taiping," in terms of martial arts, is not as difficult as "Dingjun Mountain," and in terms of singing and reciting, it is not much more than "Dingjun Mountain," "Nanyang Pass," and "Xiongzhou Pass." However, the play contains both "Erhuang" and "Xipi" tunes, and there are opportunities to use sorrowful tones in both different tunes. As long as the singer's voice is loud and strong, they can especially show the status of a great general and the tragic situation of a fallen hero. Therefore, the play's appeal is stronger. Therefore, not only was there a sensation when the already famous Tan Fuying first performed the play, but Li Shaochun, who had just entered the school of Shu Yan, was also warmly welcomed by the opera fans of the capital for this play.

<p>After directing the stage play "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears," Wu Yonggang was very interested and recently directed the sensational "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty." However, this has caused rumors outside that Wu Yonggang has left Xinhua Company. In fact, his "Yue Fei" is about to start shooting, and the cast has been decided: Liu Qiong as Yue Fei and Zhang Zhizhi as Niu Gao. He has also started working on his next play, "Li Shishi."</p>
<p>Yan Heming's sixteen-millimeter small panchromatic film, after Yang Wenying tried out the lens, Liu Qiong and Gu Lanjun also tried out a section. If successful, Xinhua Company will decide to shoot a panchromatic film.</p>
<p>"Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" is still sold out every day, so it cannot be decided when "World of Lies" will be staged. After "World of Lies" will probably be "Chen Yuanyuan."</p>
<p>Lu Ming and Xu Qinfang have recently "renovated their faces." Lu Ming's "Assassin of the King of Qin" will show her "new face." Xu Qinfang has not yet broken ties with rubber, so she has not been out much these days.</p>
<p>Minghua Company's maiden work has been decided to be "Confucius." To be cautious, director Fei Mu is still collecting materials from all sides. Zhang Yi, who plays Zilu, is also running around for it.</p>
<p>Following the "Film Union" at the Lafayette, the performers were brought together on a temporary basis, because Xu Bu's contract starts on the 16th, and they did not want to leave the half-month empty. Xu Bu's troupe is organized by people who returned to Shanghai from Zhongyi, such as Jiang Ming and Tong Yi, who are participating in the performance.</p>
