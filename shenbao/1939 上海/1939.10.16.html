<h3>重整道德運動</h3>
<p>本年七月間，美國加利佛尼州曾有世界重整道德大會之舉行。重整道德運動始於去年六月，美國富蘭克卜克門博士實發起之；首屆國際大會舉行於瑞士，今夏在美舉行者，其第二次大會也。本届與會者三十國，出席代表一千五百人，中國代表十四。七月七日，在加州之巴士的拉開幕；七月十九日，在好萊塢集會；爾後，又在孟德里半島舉行國際代表訓練大會；本報曾紀其盛。茲聞中國代表已歸上海，對於重整道德運動將繼續有所努力。記者爲人類福利計之，復爲中國國族計之，滿望此運動有切實而偉大之收穫。</p>
<p>重整道德運動之性質，超越國家種族階級之範疇；今由基督敎會爲發動之中心，然其意義則又超越宗教之範疇。陳義至高，對象至廣，然相勗爲運動之始者在小己之生活。所懸生活之標準四：曰至誠，曰純潔，曰無私，曰博愛；首務改過自新，而後推己及人；故其所懸運動之趨歸三：曰新人，曰新國，曰新世界。就其理論之基礎與程式言之，亦猶先哲誠意正心修身齊家治國平天下之義；尤式符蔣總裁之新生活運動。凡百運動，以眞理正義爲本，以利羣濟世爲懷者，不惟並行不悖，抑且殊途同歸；新生活運動倡導於上，重整道德運動推動於下，而罔不以身體力行爲責效之信條者也。</p>
<p>誠與否，存乎其意；是與非，善與惡，辦之以知；以意言之，孰不始以誠？以知言之，孰不辨是非善惡？然芸芸衆生，道德懸殊；则或以一念之私，祇圖便己利己，以誠之於己不利或不便焉，從是從善之於己不利或不便焉，於是自賊其誠而爲非作惡。其能不計利害便否，而誠以終始，務是務善者，是即恪守身體力行之信條之道德之士也。質言之，非身體力行，無以見誠，亦即不誠；非身體力行，無以明知，亦即無知。個人然，人與人相處而爲社會，國與國相處而成國際，無不然。嘗聞之矣，在此重整道德運動發動一年之中，歐洲有一故事：英人畢爾勞惠BillRowl四十餘萬失業工人中之領袖也，失業七年，遂深惡享受階級，詛咒資本主義；然號召羣衆、吶喊街頭，徒見現實社會之矛盾，其內心之苦悶乃愈甚於失業之悲哀，徬徨無以自解；會有菲力慕爾Philli　More者，以貴族而不滿於享受階級之貪婪腐敗，慨然深入失業之羣，與畢爾勞惠共朝夕者歷三星期，披肝瀝膽，共嘗甘苦；終於共同發見怨尤之無益，要在至誠，純潔，無私，博愛，自我檢討，身體力行，便見人生之光明幸福與價値。此一結論，遍傳遐邇，遂成爲美談，最足重整道德運動張目也。</p>
<p>歐美所視爲美談者，中國社會或未能感應其間旨趣；默察一般中國社會，頗有否認道德之跡象可尋、此在都市爲愈甚，都市之中，以一知半解之淺薄少年爲尤甚。此輩非不知世間有道德之名辭與理論，而不信眞有道德之人與事，不以道德爲立身處世之軌道；而以爲可欺不妨欺，可僞不妨僞，以自私自利爲當然；旣不以此爲一己之不道德，且想像人人皆若此不道德。甚者，以善於作僞，長於便私利己爲得立身處世之訣竅焉。此輩不盡在都市，不盡屬少年，亦非在一般社會中佔有甚多之數量，然不予遏止，不予打擊，不予糾正，則相習成風，有蔓延傳染之可能。職是之故，我人尤願重整道德運動者之身體力行而收切實偉大之效騐！</p>

<h3>在對戰事重累下　日本經濟已見裂痕</h3>
<p>密勒氏評論報、近發表約翰阿煦勒氏所著日本在對華侵略期間、經濟方面所遭受之牽累情形、茲譯如次</p>
<p>日本軍閥以促進國內和亞洲大陸軍隊的目的爲主旨、而擬定了日本經濟政策的模型後、這種經濟政策、較前更在成形中了、平沼內閣、雖已在六週前倒臺、但平沼的經濟政策、仍繼續施行着、因爲這種政策的主要代表者、企劃院總裁靑木、新近已兼任藏相一職、顯然的、靑木旣非不受他人支配的正當經濟家、也非日本大商業的代表、却是軍人的工具、他或將進至參謀部中一位在役的指揮程度、</p>
<p>現任陸相畑俊六、在陸軍部和日陸軍各司令部中大舉更換重要軍人、終不致使在東京支配事務的軍人、對於日本經濟、得到任何新的觀念、這一點也有重大意義、慣於指揮士兵、而見士兵們盲從的軍人、全不明瞭要同樣指揮工業·貨物·價格·匯率·和其他經濟項目而不釀成混亂、是不可能的、兩年來、軍人試圖改造日本經濟、更變它的基礎和構造、强使經濟向單方面發展、而樹立更多的戰爭工業、對於其他各方面的發展、盡加限制、日本對華戰事進行之際、經濟上所受軍事的要求和軍事的干涉、日見其多、因而日本經濟上的困難、逐步增加、軍人對於這種事實、顯然是盲目無覩、阿部政府在經濟上、只對一方面開始新的行動、有智識的日人、雖多知道日本的經濟困難日甚、但平沼禁止關於日本經濟困難的一切公開報告、絕不准報紙刋登日本的眞正難題、但新首相阿部、却似乎感覺困難如此繁多、日本一般民衆也都明瞭已不能吾認這些困難了、事實上阿部似乎已決定公布這許多困難、俾使日本人民準備另一决大犧牲、顯然爲了這種緣故、所以日本重要報紙的財政版滿載貨物缺少日甚的消息、其他消息却很少、還切實聲明有更進一步的限制平民消耗和政府加緊經濟統制的必要、這些消息使人得到在平沼統治下、百事進行、比較還順利、而阿部秉政後、却使人感覺日本的經濟局面自不佳而趨於更惡劣的印象、這種印象當然不確、因爲阿部只是讓全國知道他前任者所隱匿的事、但關於日本經濟財政窘况的整個實情、至今尙未宣布、日本在侵略中國的初步階段中、其人民很容易的受着限制、數百萬富於服從性的日人、拋棄皮鞋、再穿原始的木展、衣混合纖維的衣料、而不常發怨言、還設法不備用慣了的入口品、羣衆生活、並不大受戰爭的影響、日本全國都期望着像軍人所允諾的對中國早日獲得輕而易舉、所費無多的勝利、」他們非但期望一切經濟上的反常、早日消失、並且期待着戰利品源源不絕的運回、和來一個經濟上的旺盛、然而在經過兩年多的戰爭後、經濟上的改善、渺茫無蹤、更惡劣的是原有的經濟困難、却逐漸增加不已、日本羣衆開始對於大局表示眞正的驚惶、是事所當然的了、</p>
<p>現在阿部已准許受統制的報紙公開披露物料短缺、這和每個日人的日常生活、都有深切關係、家庭的煤·電媒氣·和紙張消耗、須加限制、日本帝國且初决明瞭食物的短少了、米·糖·蛋·和罐頭食品、現悉由政府規定計日派給民衆、八九兩月間物價水準激增、但工資與薪給、還未能與物價新水準相調整時、勅令却已禁止增加工資與薪給、報紙雖續載幻想中的在華勝利消息、却不能消釋日本發覺自身所處的絕望局勢、今希望日本人民將感到這種消息、可抵償他們所受的新困難、已非易事、</p>
<p>阿部內閣、業已實行經濟統制的新條例、條例數目之多、遠超阿部新政府秉政以來的日數、新的限制形式盡同、就新近統制的貨物而言、陸軍與海軍兩部、首先徵發其所需要的、或認爲行將需要的給養、剩餘物品分配時、戰爭工業享有確切的優先權、最遭殃的、是承平時的工業、和平民的消耗、但有眞正生產力、而支持着日本的、却祇是承平時的工業和平的消耗、久受其累的紡織業的電力供給、大受削减、以致近數星期來棉紗·棉布·和人造絲的產量、又告大跌、名古屋區紗廠的白天電力供給、已全被截斷、它的活動、不得不以一般人需用電力最少的午夜時間爲限、政府對於紡織廠的合併、久已反對、現在突然加以鼓勵、所以若干工廠或將關閉、餘者改成一所新的第一等工廠、報紙現正促請平民成「更大而更好的愛國者」、束緊褲帶、及早就寢、勿燃過多的電燈、百物都事撙節、然而人人都須節下更多金錢、存入儲蓄銀行、以便大藏省能够利用這款、認購戰爭和彌補國用的公債、十月六日頒佈的勅令、意在遏止近來物價的增高、按照這些命令、一切物價、如工資薪給·房租·運費等、不得超過九月十八日的水準、政府保留准許例外超過這水準之權、這些突如其來的辦法、是以前任陸相板垣在數月前所提要求爲根據、而不顧中央物物委員會主席池田的竭力反對、池田是前任藏相和松井大君、現在是日本私人高級金融界的傑出代表、這一點、表示軍人終已壓倒池田而獲勝利了、還表明何種勢力控制着阿部政府的經濟政策、但是新的物價統制計劃、絕對沒有醫治物價高漲的病根、所以必將歸於失敗、政府指摘商人爲投機目的而囤貨漲價、也許有一部份理由、但日本近來物價的飛漲、還有許多根本原因、最主要的還是一般民衆已明瞭日本國內百物短缺日甚、日元隨英鎊而跌價、和通貨膨脹之風、日進不已、上月杪、日本的物價、漲到戰事爆發以來的最高度、而日本銀行的紙幣流通額、造成本年度新的最高紀錄、超出日金二十六萬萬元之譜、這兩事決不是偶然的、日本銀行正式宣佈的通貨準備金、是日金五萬零一百萬元、許多消息靈通人士相信這些準備已經耗去、卽使日本銀行仍有五萬零一百萬元的準備金、日元的準備金也已低落什二、而遠不及按照目前上海匯率的法幣準備金的半數、</p>
<p>日本軍人不瞭解產生困難的、並不是日本的經濟、而是他們自己造成的軍事局勢、才使日本的經濟困難、有增無已、因爲大量生產軍需、供給國內和在華的陸海軍、而有生產力的承平時的工業、却屈居無生產力的戰時工業之下、所以日本國內貨物缺少、日本現用不斷擴張國債的方法、籌資充在華冒險事業的戰費、這是日本通貨膨脹的原因、日本經濟困難的根本原因、便是中國戰爭、它已將日本的經濟陷於力不堪負的重累之下、日本軍人企圖完成其國家經濟機構和資源力所不能及之事、這便是從前很形穩定的日本經濟、現在何以已見危險裂痕的原因、日本軍閥的行動實已太不自量了、</p>

<h3>世界海運市況</h3>
<p>— 秦淮碧</p>
<p>歐戰爆發與海運市況</p>
<p>自第二决歐洲大戰爆發以來，呆滯已久的世界海運業，即突呈反動姿勢。關於遠海重洋的水脚和船租的飛漲已如上决歐洲大戰爆發時一樣。</p>
<p>茲將反映市况最爲敏銳的世界主要不定期船隻航綫的運費，列表於后，以見飛漲的一般情形。（單位先令）</p>
<p>（註）遠東至歐洲，歐洲至遠東的運費的漲二成左右。</p>
<p>就世界標準航路南美利弗浦至歐洲的穀類運費行市觀之：初由十先令升為三十先令。劇九月七日電訊，謂將漲至四十先令。十日十一日二日電訊，據說更將飛漲到五十先令之譜。船費當然亦即隨之呈活躍狀態。據九月九日電訊，紐的市塲上的西印度小型渡船六個月船費爲三美允，但據十一日電訊則稱：凡原定船費在美金一元七角五者，今則改爲四元七角五。此種激增，實已使世界海運市塲的行市在熱的超出戰前的六倍。今後海市狀態續保持逐漸昇漲的節拍，這是勢所必然的結果。</p>
<p>到九月十八日爲止，世界各主要航錢的運費價目大體如下：</p>
<p>A歐戰前後主要航綫運費比較表各主要航綫的運費高漲情形由此可見一般。總之，在不定期的船隻方面大概漲了一倍，而在定期的船隻方面則自二成起一直漲到五成。然而推測將來或者可以不至再有過甚的變動。</p>
<p>歐洲大戰正在繼續中，各國政府對於應取的物價對策，莫不詳加考慮，以便應付當前的艱阻。不過這類對策與在自由經濟之下所推進的第一决歐洲大戰當時的政策，當然根本不同的，這是可以預料。至少像第一决大戰時，從西貢運米至歐洲要六百先令；從普萊脫遝雜糧至歐洲要二百七十先令，如此的瘋在行情，此决想不致於再出現了。</p>
<p>英國的運費對策</p>
<p>與歐戰發動同時，英國政府爲確保其軍隊及戰時重要物資之輸送任務起見，一方面組織租船委員會，一方面則採取應付戰時經濟的方策，對國內竭力注重物價的抑制。至於運費的高漲勢燄，當然亦非盡力加以阻止與緩和不可。這就是說；對於自菲列濱至紐的的運費要想一漲高五成的，則祇准其漲二成半，自新嘉坡至紐的要想漲起五成的，則祇准其漲二成；澳洲至歐洲二成半，馬尼剌至香港或上海亦爲二成半。此外，英政府又確定穀物的公定運費。他方面，對於作爲五年計畫而在七月十三議會上所提出的龐大的救濟海運案，則主張加以强化；對於足以削弱指導地位的，由教倫向紐的的世界海運中心市塲的轉移，則竭力表示反對；因此英政府從事補强工作，不遺餘力，以期對紐約市塲予以嚴厲的制裁。例如關於普來脫至歐洲的雜糧運費經政府公定爲三十先令，船租方面也是如此。至於自國船隻的租費規定，大型船爲七先令六便士至六先令六便士。這在英政府固爲得計，然於一般船商則多表不滿。其後，根據某一情報更調英國將在內閣中設置海運部，對於道一機構及其運用究竟會有什麼效果，我們雖然不大明白，但是以一飽嚐上次大戰經騐的大國，突然添設這一海運部，當然不是毫無道理的。</p>
<p>海上兵險費率增高</p>
<p>除上述運費和船費飛漲之外，還有海上兵險費率也在跟着增加。自從歐戰爆發迄今，先後已經有了兩决改訂。新訂費率較戰前已高二倍。茲就上海至各地費率（按每百計算）上海至英國愛爾蘭自由邦或歐陸（德義及其屬地除外）爲二·三七五允，上海至北美大西洋各口岸經蘇彝士（地中海加費在內）爲二·八七五元，上海至北美大西洋各口岸經好望角爲〇·八七五元，上海至北美大西洋各口岸經巴拿馬爲〇·六七五元，上海至地中海各埠（加費在內）爲二·七五〇元，上海至波斯灣（新定）爲〇·五元，上海至東菲及南菲（新定）爲〇·六六五元，上海至黑海各部（新定加費在內）爲三·七五元，因經地中海的加費爲目一元增至二元，所以上海經地中海至倫教的費率巳自二元三角七分半加至四元三角七分半。其他至南美東西兩岸經好　角爲八角七分半，至澳州八角七分半，至海峽殖民地印度東菲洲三角七分半，至其他各綫及中國沿海各部二角半。其中至澳州及中國口岸並朱增加。但這費率對於德義兩國及其屬地都不適用。</p>
<p>歐戰爆發，海上運輸之危險性當然加大，兵險的增高，這是常然道理，不過各項費用如運費船費等同時飛漲，影饗海運事業自然不少，結果定將招致世界貿易不景氣的再現。</p>
<p>各國在華航業的衰落</p>
<p>最後講到歐洲大戰對於各國在華航業的影響。中國主要口岸自經日本海軍封鎖之後，歐美各國航業公司營業就一落千丈，不但華北航業全爲日輪攫奪，就是業南華中也皆受到日商嚴重的打擊；其中當然以英國所受允爲滬重。戰前在長江內的英國輪船計有太古，怡和，祥泰，亞細亞等四大公司，所有船舶噸位共達六萬五千七百噸；以船數言，亦佔百分之三十九，巍居第一位。今則首席已爲日商所獨佔。至於沿海的航業亦因日軍的封鎖，營業日趨式微，大有朝不保夕之槪。英國政府屢决向日政府抗議，不但沒有絲毫效果，而且在反英政策的推動之下，使英國在華航　的前途，幾瀕破產，今則英國方有事於歐洲，對於遠東航業更受影響，現在原駛遠東的英輪多被他調，因此日輪航務更形活躍了。</p>
<p>北洋航錢分：滬海，滬靑，滬津，滬連，滬營，滬安等段以及靑，海，烟，龍，津，秦，營，連，安各分段。以前行駛各綫的船隻除國營招商局外，民營的有政記，北方，直東，肇興，大通興，毓大　公司，外商輪船則有英商太古怡和兩公司。但戰後國輪　繼被迫停航，而英商太古怡和各輪亦迭遭阻撓，僅能勉强維持滬靑烟津等航錢。今則又因歐戰而宣吿停業。至於日商則在日本海軍當局合作之下大事擴充，除日淸，大連，山下，大阪，近海，國際等日輪公司竭力企圖獨霸華北航　外，同時又收買政記公司全部輪隻，並承租華商各輪，專駛華北各航綫，這樣華北航綫竟成了日商的天地。</p>
<p>南洋航綫分：滬甬，滬甌，滬閩，滬廈，滬汕，滬港，滬粵等段，以及內港滬台，滬瑞平，滬興泉與甬，定，象，台，甌，閩，泉，厦，汕，港，粵，澳，梧各分段。其中除內港由華商派輪行駛外，滬閩，滬甬，滬汕港粵等綫，一向由英商太古，怡和派輪常川往來，但其後因日艦藉口軍事行動，企圖封鎖溫州，福州，泉州，興化，三都澳，沙埕等口岸，並在沿海任意扣留檢査外輪，阻撓航行，以致行駛各該綫的各國輸隻喪失自由航行權，營業頓形衰落。所以目前芷是在華已有八十餘年歷史的各國航業遭遇厄運的日子。</p>
<h3>過去一週</h3>
<p>在上一週，百物騰貴的現象，至少已經停止；在投機市塲上，大致且呈百物下降的狀態。如以上週六與前週六的行市比較：現金小六十允元；廿支雙馬現貨小廿二元；通州花小十一元；各級米價大致小六七元至十二三元不等。這時外匯節節放長，週末的軟弱是僅由巨戶掙扎的結果。掙扎的成績也不過如此，可見多頭的勢力，總爭不過客觀環境的好轉！好轉的客觀環境是什麼呢？一是長沙大勝堅定了華人最後勝利的信心；一是歐陸方面不死不活的戰局，已使中國的出口業大爲活躍。所以要過好日子的辦法並不難，大家應該努力的方向也不外乎此。（編者）</p>
<p>假使你想「名利雙收」，機會是在郵政　的小窗口等着你，據報載：全國一千多個郵局，從十一月底起，都要發售節的建國儲蓄券」，把你節的所得去買道種儲蓄券，現在帮助「建國」，將來不單可以收本，還有利息收入；豈不是一舉而「名利雙收」了。（王四維）</p>
<p>日本外務省內外官員全體辭職的風潮，因阿部對部屬屈服之故，似乎已吿一段落。假使今後沒有其他阻碍，貿易省大概就可擇吉開張了。設立該省的目的，不外乎挾貿易以補助外交上的折衝，同時企圖達成振興輸出的願望。可是他只有和平性商品的輸出力，這決非各國所歡迎；各國歡迎進口的軍需物資，在日木正是自顧不遑，決無餘力出口。因此他在外交上並不能挾此而發生什麼力量，就是在輸出振興的希望上也是渺乎其小，何况振興出口的先決條件，便耍有充分的原料。在他只有一個辦法，那就是取諸於中國。要不是他在湘北大吃敗仗，淪陷區裏的什麼「合作」什麼「統制」的把戲，也許已很熱鬧了（正則）</p>
<p>記者恰在上期本刊裹預料造船中將伍堂卓雄坐不住農林大臣位置，遲早要拱手讓人；想不到昨天的東京電訊，已有伍堂讓位的消息。阿部理想中的集權制度，因此又打了折扣。不禁替阿部灰心。（編者）</p>
<h3>上半年之中國銀行業</h3>
<p>— 楊政</p>
<p>銀行的設立之變動半年來新設銀行，祗有昆明的興文銀行和蘭州的甘肅銀行二家。前者是興文官銀號改組，於五月一日成立，資本爲新滇幣六十萬元由滇省財政廳撥款興辦。査該官銀號沿革，初爲興文，當於遜淸光緒十九年成立，經營匯兌及典當業二種業務。民國後迭經改革。自財政廳加入官股後，遂改爲官銀號，資本總額爲滇新幣三百萬元。業務範圍，較前擴大，除存放，信託，押典等項外，又代理財政廳金庫，教育事業經費，及軍政款項等業務。後者係甘省平市官錢局奉財政部命令所改組，於六月一日開業。</p>
<p>半年來停業的銀行，爲北平北洋保商銀行一家，於一月五日宣佈淸理。査該行係遜淸光緒三十四年由北洋大臣倡議設立，至宜統二年，始吿成立。初額定資本爲四百萬兩，後來改爲有限公司，實收資本爲一百十二萬九千五百元。總行設北平，分行設天津，曾發行紙幣，至去年底，的爲三百萬元。</p>
<p>裁併和添設　半年來銀行的裁併分支行，計有六家，內分行四家，辦事處二家。就地域來說，上海五家，宜昌祇一家，</p>
<p>半年來銀行添設分支行，多在西南各省。這是中國金融重心，轉移到西南各省的表現；半年來分支行添設列表如下月份行名地域一月份</p>
<p>業務的動態　半年來銀行業務的動態，是配合着中國戰時金融政策而進行。如中央及特許銀行，因鑒於後方金融的重耍，經中，中，交，農四行聯合總處之決議，在西南，西北各省，敷設金融網，分四期進行，限本年內完成。而四行貼放委員會，對各地土產業，鹽業，五金業，電料業，船舶業，以及各廠商，凡直接或間接與軍事有關的事業，特予以接濟資金。更因各城市的慘遭轟炸，人口疏散，乃有在毘近鄕村，撥資建築房屋，預定費用爲一千萬元。而對各城市之炸後復興貸款，是積極協助政府進行。此外，財政部規定中國銀行，辦理華僑匯款。省市立銀行的業務動態，自三月間第二次地方金融會議後，決議下列六項：（一）發展經濟力量（一）維護幣制信用，（三）增進業務，（四）收購物資，（五）平衡物價，（六）接濟糧食之需要。其各項所含的實質，均與民生國計以及復興經濟的基礎，有切實的關係。省市立銀行，均能遵照所決議案進行，是有顯著成績的表現。</p>

<p>兩性衛生</p>
<h3>第一性特徵及生殖機能的衛生</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>關於兩性的差別，表面上似乎很明顯很容易，其實有時很含渾難辨；有幾種動物，是僅在交尾期中性的特微顯著的，有些鳥類，爬虫類，是祗能由相當認識經騐的人，才可斷定其爲雌或爲雄，普通人是不可能的，卽在人類，有時男女的區別也很難斷定，必須由專家或專門醫生經長期之檢查，始克明確的區分出來，因爲人類亦與動物相似，有雌雄同體的人（通稱爲陰陽人），不過量數較動物爲少罷了。通常所見者多爲類似陰陽人，僅其外表具有男女兩性的特微；若眞具有兩性的生殖，則可稱爲眞性陰陽人，但其數實甚少也。所以徒具兩性的外觀，是不足據以區別男女的，必須視其卵巢或睪丸之有無，方可爲區別之標準，倘若一人的身體內生有睪丸，則此人爲男性，同樣，一人身　　內生有卵巢，則此人爲女　　　所以第一性特微，是由直　　　生殖關係的睪丸與卯巢，爲　　區別的標準。</p>
<p>一般人在生出時已有睪丸或卵巢，所以第一性特徵是生而就有的，關於兩性生殖上之衛生，與人類之繫榮大有關係，故特分述如下：</p>
<p>生殖之衛生，一言以蔽之，是卽慾是也。在未婚之前，首宜守貞，淸心寡慾，勿自凟而斵傷，使新陳代謝之機能衰退，早衰腎虧，腦與腎部遂失却繁榮的保障，百病叢生，遺精滑精，神經衰弱，腰痠背痛，漸漸形成，若不早爲補救，後患堪虞，余以醫師的立塲，證明此種疾病的治療，唯有積極服用德國老牌睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」始有回春之望，同時允宜避免誤購類似之僞藥，蓋市上雖有以同樣成分之製劑號召病家，然多數爲變相之春藥，或類似春藥之補劑，惟有補體康一藥，爲眞正之雄壯動物睪丸精質大補劑，並有補腦之燐質摻入，其女用有調經種子之功，治貧血早衰，見效允速。</p>
<p>可驚的發見　美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>淋病已有特效藥</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>余對於淋病的研究，垂十數年，當負笈美邦時，卽注意此症之根治。深知淋菌一物，繁殖神速，貨絕一般下等細菌，故宜趕速治療，庶幾不致發生變化，而在治療上，不僅採取迅速治療方針，且必須具穩妥之條件。因爲徒然用霸烈之藥以求速效，往往因爲副作用之强大，反而得不償失。故於此點，必須特別留意。</p>
<p>凡在感染淋病兩週之後，淋菌就有淋菌流竄血液中，雖　外表上祇見淋菌的症狀，但　　往往發生種種症狀。故必　　　治療，據各國學者及余　　　之經騐，惟行白血球之增加療法，及免疫抗毒治療，則可因血球之猛力殺菌，結果使淋菌無所逃遁，能吻合以上條件者，惟德國彼德博士所發明之「克淋儂」，始可常之無愧，此劑係用精粹之黃色素蛋白體混合製成，凡是急慢性淋病，加攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，關節炎，膀胱炎，前後尿道炎等，均可服，「克淋儂」藥以根治之，凡上述各種淋病，服此劑後，可發生非特異性之抗淋毒素，以向淋菌進攻，於是一切淋菌，即迅速治愈永無再發之事。至於外用藥方面，以「抗淋水」爲最，患者可按圖與說明書在家自行洗滌尿道，以淸除尿道上之淋菌，女子可外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥，則奏功尤偉。蓋唯有此等療法，則剿滅淋菌，如風掃殘葉，與彼一般透膜殺菌療法，實不可同日而語。此所以久博各國醫家之賞用也。</p>
<h3>癆病治驗例</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>患者馮永德，體素羸弱。於二十歲嘗患咯血。休養數月卽愈，後因用腦過度，去夏又發，胸悶氣嗆。咳出血痰。日暮發三十七度七之輕熱，形體益呈淸减，憔悴不堪，入夜睡難安枕。多夢心悸，兼有盜汙，致晨起頭目眩暈，精神倦怠。經用X光檢查，肺部有銀角大小空洞，肺癆已至第三期，乃囑內服德國「補肺拿爾」。服未兩瓶。盜汗發熱俱除，病勢大見好轉，於是櫃續不斷的服用至三星期，並同時令其在家絕對安靜，與多攝營養品：於咳嗆咯血等症，完全獲愈，而食慾大增，體重增加。一變而爲壯健之美男子矣。</p>
<p>遺精治愈例</p>
<h3>遺精與腦弱</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>患者池宏賓，丹陽人，年廿一歲，居本埠法租界南陽橋，（自訴）——自小體質孱弱多病，十六歲時來滬就業，無自凟惡習，亦無不良嗜好，自十八歲秋季起，夜間睡夢之中，每有夢遺發生，但亦不以爲意，因該時知識幼稚，而不覺遺精之爲害，如是每月平均的有四次之夢遺，但在遺精後之翌晨，則感覺精神疲憊，頭痛脚軟等病象，此時余曾購服某種麥精魚肝油，的服三瓶而亦無效，半年後，遺精次數漸决增加，時有頭昏，記憶力薄弱，並患失眠症，旋由友人介紹，往某中醫處診治，據云日間操勞過度所致，服丸藥兩瓶而亦無效，而病象惡化，見報載特來求治云云（治愈經過）——投以大量之「耐而斯遺精片」使止其遺精，並兼以男用「補體康」以治神經衰弱及補其虧損，池君遵言而行，三星期後，遺精卽無發生，夜眠亦安，令其再服兩月，精神大振，頭腦淸爽，體重增加十三磅。遺精從此根治。</p>
<p>淋病講座</p>
<h3>淋病再發之根治問題</h3>
<p>— 姚菊嚴醫師撰診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋病原爲一種極頑固之疾患，若於初患時旣未妥爲治療，成爲慢性後叉無根治之決心，致病毒的進行，益見深刻，雖僥倖一時獲愈，而往往有再發之虞，因淋病患者，每於身體健康時，其抵抗力甚强——其一部之抵抗力係由淋菌發生後，但患者如遇其他原因，如體力衰弱，於是向所視爲平愈之淋病，乘機復起，肆虐於人，患者於其時之痛苦，必較以前爲甚，而病的變化亦較以前難以逆料，蓋淋菌久被抑鬱，外表雖平安無事，而其內在情形，因淋菌之繁殖潛伏，是以一旦發動，如水汜濫，遂難遏制耳。雖然上文所述，不過淋病患者，因身體健康與能守攝生方法，使病患暫時平復。更有因用霸藥，或拙劣手術，使其暫時屈伏，旋即再發者，其審視前更烈。總之淋病如表面上雖無病象，而體中尙有淋菌的潛伏，決不能視爲根治。余年來對於此等屢决再發之淋病，已有切實療法之把握，先用血淸檢騐，證明其有淋毒的潛伏外，卽用德國靜電療法，及X線療法交相爲用，一方並內服淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，使共殺菌功效洋浴全身，則任何淋菌，絕對不能逃遁，故能徹底根本解決。故一經治愈，絕無復發之事，此則眞堪符合根本解決淋病之淋法也診時：上午十時至下午六時。每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並贈價値一元之「性病全書」一冊。</p>

<p>新聲社記者昨日曾赴漢口路外灘該行視察、因該行日兵所借用之房屋、爲三四層樓全部、至樓下及二層、會爲各撤退行辦公用、至三四層樓與樓下及二層業已隔斷、日兵出入、均走漢口路十號大鬥、故各撤退行之辦公、並不發生任何障碍、又記者昨晤該行某副經理、證實各撤退行準今日起在原址復業、補習班之文件等、確已如數搬出、招考試用行員問題俟覓定地址、即行續辦、</p>
<p>英軍一度前往視察</p>
<p>交行行址所在地、純爲英軍防守區域、日方驟出此舉動、不僅有碍租界警權、且直接向英軍有威脅意義、該駐滬英軍當局、得悉此訊、當於昨晨九時許、調派一小隊央軍的三十餘名、全副武裝、實地前往該漢口路一帶視察、至十時許、始行撤退、聞英軍前往視察後、即將據情報吿駐華英軍最高當局、請示辦法、以便相機應付、</p>

<p>昨日午後續發高潮</p>
<p>據　浦局預測、浦江於昨日午後一時三十五分、續發高潮、數量計十一英尺、故馬路陰溝再見冒水、低窪路面復有積水盈溢、至交通方面、昨均已恢復、惟公共汽車如法租界二十二路公共汽車等、仍須繞道福煦路而迄晚仍不免涉水而過、昨全日天色陰晦、氣候尚未正式、</p>

<h3>兩德輪歷險記　避免英艦兜截歷盡艱辛船客聽天由命慶幸更生</h3>
<p>德國北德輪船公司之達東班郵船香霍斯晚及克茂蘭兩號、爲此間人十所諗悉、當歐戰爆發之初、該兩輪適在東方海面行駛、其行蹤頓趨神秘、各界亦甚爲關心、後悉此兩輪繞道避免英艦之兜截、而遁抵日本海岸停泊、即逐漸</p>
<p>淡然忘之</p>
<p>大中社記者昨晤由日本到滬之某西人、據談、其親友有乘香霍斯脫及克茂蘭兩輪、親歷此决險境者、所述駭聞驚心之故事如下、克茂蘭輪於八月二十五日載客由星加坡赴馬尼刺、是晚、乘客悉被召赴甲板、船長俄頃蒞臨致詞、首謂本輪已經德國海軍部微發、故非復爲克茂蘭輪　、</p>
<p>婦女乘客</p>
<p>聞訊之下、頓時嚎啕大哭、船長繼稱、本輪不復駛往馬尼刺、而將開赴一不知名之地點、乘客至此、亦祇得以聽天由命自慰、自此以後、克茂蘭號輪在太平洋中、紆廻繞道而行、烟囱及船名、均被漆沒、行駛二十餘天、始抵</p>

<p>甲丙兩種各增一倍</p>
<p>在目前寄椗租費、每二十四小時甲種規定爲國幣三十元、丙種規定爲十五元、昨據江海關消息、海關港務課茲以人工及金屬品漲價甚鉅、致修補浮筒　練及機械之費用、隨之激增、照原定租費實不足補償、故已決定自本月二十六日起、照原租費增加一倍、即以前甲種爲三十元者、增加爲六十元、丙種爲十五元者、增加爲三十元、</p>

<h3>馮玉祥的鞋與食</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>馮玉祥，現在是軍事委員會的副委員長了，在幼年時代，還他是一個在野地裏拾荒的孩子呢。</p>
<p>因爲家貧，所以他在小時候，連手做的布鞋都沒有穿過，平時在家中穿的是二鞋，二鞋是把人家穿得已經破舊不堪的鞋子拿來，呌鞋匠少爲縫紉而成。據說，馮玉祥是有足疾的，就因爲在當時參穿了不合式的二鞋之故。在野地裹拾荒，則穿草鞋；有時，則連草鞋也不穿，就讓脚光着。</p>
<p>到現在，他是仍愛穿其夫人親製的布鞋，西式的皮鞋，他是連看也不要看的。</p>
<p>至於食的方面呢。他在小時候也是很苦的，肉一年難得有幾次進口，一日三餐，不是燒餅，便是窩窩頭。在民國二十二年，他到上海的時候，在一頓午餐上吃了大餅油條，就有人說他壞話。他就這樣說：「能吃大餅油條，在我已經算是升入天堂了！」</p>
<p>還有一件趣事，他每决到保定的時候，總到南大街一爿呌平老靜的食店，去吃牛肉包子，有人問他：「何故？」他說：「因爲該店老闆，從前曾把一付包金鐲子當在當舖裹，後去贖時，該店伙計給了他一付眞金鐲子，但他仍去退回。到這種店裏去吃東西，我覺得很榮幸，倒不是爲了他們所做的包子味道好。」</p>
<h3>湖南學生的土布制服</h3>
<p>— 嗚</p>
<p>湖南敎育的發達，這是全國所及不上的，就省會一隅而論，學校林立，主其事者，頗能努力苦幹，設施完備，學生精神亦多富有朝氣，而允以樸實的學生服裝在繫盛的街市上，你目光接觸到的莘莘學子，無論男女，終年穿了一身元色土布制服，很少穿着絲毛織品的；一般女學生，非但一律土布裙褂，並且不施脂粉，至於那種裁製衣服的土布原料，純粹是來自鄕間自紡自織和自己染的，這才配稱做是完全國貨了。</p>
<p>伊們的服裝，最多的是一種短褂短裙，上半截穿上一件元色土布褂子，下半身配上一條齊膝蓋的元色土布裙子，覆額的頭髮，明亮的眼波，在胸膛的右部，用白色絨綫繡上了學校的名稱，和學校裏編列的號碼，雖然不塗脂抹粉，那種淡妝素服，却也別具風格，並且流露了一種天然的健康美，這是我們江浙截髮作時裝的女學生所不及的。</p>
<h3>元帥醬油</h3>
<p>— 俊</p>
<p>「通海醬油甲全滇，元帥醬油甲通海。」通海造醬油的有六七家，在道六七家中，又以元帥醬油爲巨擘。因爲元帥醬油創業三代以來，曾以味美質純聞名，烹調餚饌，　意　口，故飪　之間，良　大菜，無不爭得之以相誇耀，近年來，聲譽日隆，暢銷日盛，臨箇八屬，代爲轉售的不下數十家，路過通海之客，也以購帶一瓶爲不可多得。在昆明允屬身價十倍。產量每年總額的二十萬斤以上，以產量說，也算元帥了，元帥醬油者何？即鼎鼎大名「調鼎齋」便是。</p>
<p>然則，元帥之名，究竟從何而起？因何而得？據「調鼎齋」主人稱：元帥醬油之名，自民國十年前即有，因爲雲南督軍唐繼堯，最講究吃喝，每菜不離醬油，而吃醬油，又非吃「調鼎齋」的醬油不可，蓋唐繼堯曾仟　元帥職，(當時大元帥爲孫總理)故以其榮而名諸醬油，這正如漢武得鼎，以名其書，叔孫勝敵，以名其子的誌喜一樣，和宜良的「都督燒饅」同爲滇中掌故之奇蹟哩</p>

<p>出外如果能夠少坐車子，也可以增進你的健康，祇是一班的人，忽略了這件事情而已。住在都市裹的人們，驕養慣的，出入總以汽車，包車代步，平日祇知電影院，京戲館是娛樂塲所，不去運動。這班公子哥兒，難享盡人間樂趣，但身體吧，却是孱弱的居多，時常要害病，這便是少走路，少運動的弊病。</p>
<p>職業界人爲了時間關係，以上海這都市中說來，出入也多半是乘人力車，電車，公共汽車的，而職業界人，以體格說來，也是瘦弱的多。現在有好多人已感到身體的瘦弱，主要的原因，是爲了缺少運動，但有的爲了年齡關係，有的爲了上海這都市中公共的運動設備很少，所明知缺少運動之弊，也不去　動。</p>
<p>事實上運動的方法並沒有限定的格式；換一句話說，一個人祇要手足和身體時常在動作，也是運動。所以一個勞工，他就是不去作種種運動，實在呢，他一天到晚在運動，而祇有每天坐寫字間或祇吃飯不做事的公子哥兒，才是眞正的缺少運動。我們能够運動，就可鍛鍊體格，使身體强壯。</p>
<p>在我以爲步行也是運動，可使身體健康，因爲你在步行時，手和脚都要動，身體也要動。所以我相信步行也會增進健康的，記得當我求學時，每天早上，如果不下雨，上學總是步行，要沿愛文義路北京路折入四川路，早晚走很長的路，那時我的身體比沒有到上海時更好。最近爲了戰事，收入减少，同時更爲實行節的起見，出去不大坐車子，步行時多。但近來我的身體也比一年前好，平時我也難得去運動的；因此，我已體騐到走路的確可增進健康的。</p>
<p>在上海道都市中，有的爲了職務，有的爲了有錢而裝闊，出入非坐車不可。有的職務並不相關，錢也不富裕，但出去爲貪省力，也要坐車，而同時却知道自己缺少運動，身體很弱，想要運動，不是爲時間所限，便是不善遝動。在這種情形之下，我們不妨以步行代替運動，也未始不可增進健康呢！</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>蝦這樣東西，現在是貴極了。不要說家常菜中難得和它見面；就是上菜館子去出了很大的價錢，吃一盆炒蝦仁，也是靑豆多而蝦仁少，不足以快朵頤，至於成對的明蝦呢，早已過時，雖在廣東菜館中偶然可以吃到，也都是冰箱中的東西了。我這經濟菜單中，在最近期間，差不多已沒有了蝦的地位，倘若一定要嘗嘗蝦的味兒，那麼只得借重小白蝦了。小白蝦雖說也要四五分錢一兩，但是買一角錢，加着輔佐品在內　也可分　兩碗，供日夜兩餐之需了。做法很普通，家家都會得做，一種是小白蝦炒蛋，一種是把小白蝦和豆腐一同紅燒；一種是小白蝦和韮菜同炒，一種是將小白蝦和毛豆香菌邊尖菱白丁豆腐乾等一同紅燒，很有些炒十景的意味。星期一刀豆炒肉片白蝦燒豆腐雪菜　豆芽星期二洋蔥牛肉絲糖醋煎帶魚清炒雞毛菜煎臭豆腐乾星期三靑菜獅子頭小白蝦炒蛋菠菜豆腐湯蝦子炒麵筋星期四咖哩牛肉片清炊鯽魚湯紅燒素　景雪菜黃豆芽星期五　菜炒肉絲蟹粉燒豆腐青菜炒綫紛甜醬炒扁豆星期六番茄牛肉湯粉皮燒白魚紅燒卷心菜　漿毛豆莢星期日肉炒醬煎黃魚金花菜拌芹菜</p>
<h3>美國汽車裹的流動家庭</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>—包括衣食住行四項—</p>
<p>—家庭設備應有盡有—</p>
<p>在美國有位青年旅行家，詹姆史密斯氏·從幼喜歡旅行，因此設計創造了一輛汽車的拖車，在旅行時作為臨時的家庭·這車闊約七呎，長約二十五呎，前後皆流綫型，在車廂之中，精致地配備着三個巧小的房間，在房間中的一切設備，都是現代化的。包括冷熱水龍頭，廁所，浴室，電源，餐室，臥室等，一共可供給八個人的起居飲食。當此旅行拖車完成之後，即由他的故鄉雪波地方，開往美國佛勞列大省西部的海濱旅行。</p>
<p>這新奇的旅行，却引起了許多美國人的興趣，有許多學時髦的人，彼此都效學起來，不到五個月，在這海濱上竟發現有幾百輛之多，因此有一般的投機商，竟在這類的汽車裹，開設雜貨店，飲食店，醫院，甚至於理髪店，書店和洗衣店等，一應俱全。所以這個合羣性的汽車家庭，可以不依靠外界的一切供給，能維持到十天以上的獨立生活。假使甲地玩得厭的時候，能從甲地立刻搬移到乙地。</p>
<p>這類汽車中最小的一種，亦可供夫婦二人及一個小孩子的生活，在車廂中，包含一個或二個小房間，一切設備很簡潔而玲瓏，普通一些的，有餐桌一張，單人未二張，可習合的椅子二把，一雙可藏二十加侖的水箱，一隻冰箱，一隻衣箱，一隻儲藏餐室器皿的木箱，一隻裝蓮蓬頭的浴缸，一副煮菜用的電爐，和一架收音機。車中的每件東西，在不需要的時候，能摺合，能隱藏。總之，每樣物件的佈置，都不會感到討厭和不便，尤其是車頂上車廂的角落裏，每一個地方，無不加以適當的利用。在車子的後部，還巧妙地裝出一個小小的月台，在月台上有二把椅子，在野外行駛的時候，能坐在月台上望望野外的風景，至於車中的電燈，平時都用蓄電池的，但是在接近城市的地方，亦能接用城市裹的交流電。</p>
<p>每當夏季，天氣炎熱的時候，此類汽車大都開往加里福尼亞去避暑，在那兒的投機商，也因此設立了一所專供汽車家庭停歇的廣場，名汽車家庭集中營，在這集中營裹停留一個星期，每輛汽車納費一元·在納費之後，就可免費享用電源及自來水。因此每年往該處去避署的汽車家庭，有幾萬人之多，並且還有十五個汽油站，亦為了這許多汽車家庭而設立的。</p>
<p>這流動家庭的汽車，除居住和旅行之外，還可兼充其他的用途。有人把它開設流動的店舖，電影院把它作爲流動的電影塲，影片公司到野外去　外景的時候，影星們可利用它化裝和休息，醫院裏利用它作爲流動的治療室，游泳者能利用它作爲更衣室及休息室。總之，這類的汽車家庭是新奇的發現，並且是極感興趣的一種小型家庭。</p>

<h3>在籌備中的　語文展覽會</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>所徵求的物品范圍非常廣泛</p>

<p>的確，這决展覽的範圍是很廣的。在分類上可以列舉的有：（一）紀錄語文之工具：（二）書報；（三）圖表；（四）語文與風土；（五）實物上所見之語文；（六）演講題；（七）表現；（八）其他有關語文之物品。在道裏，我們不難看出這决的展覽，徵求出品範圍的廣泛。如果對語文的物品有研究及興趣，而踴躍參加，那麼這個展覽會一定有相當的可觀的。</p>
<p>進一步，關於紀錄語文工具方面，自結繩模型以及刀筆模型，筆，墨，甲骨，樹皮，竹簡，打字機，印刷工具等，都在收羅之列。書報方面；文法書，辭典，字典，報紙，雜誌，方言文藝，基督敎聖經，道敎經，佛敎經，中國各民挨之文字書籍，如滿，蒙，藏，西夏及漢文書等。圖表方面包括有關語文的圖畫，攝影，拓片，墨蹟，碑帖，美術字等。語文與土風方面：包括八卦，吉字，吉語，符籙，及咒語。實物方面有錢幣，郵票十所表現的文字。演講題方面有語文發展，方言研究，近代傳達語文的工具，如電報，鬣話，無綫電，和印刷術等。表現方面有盲人語文表現，速記術表現，電話機表現，新文字表現，方言表現，旗語等。</p>

<h3>一個苦學生的生活</h3>
<p>— 一封</p>
<p>我是受戰爭影響而受經濟壓迫的一個學生，現在江蘇省立上海中學高中某科肄業。茲將我之平日生活狀况，吿社會人士，且希滬上經濟富裕之學生，勿將金錢妄用。我之生活情形今分條詳述於左：</p>
<p>（一）金錢之收支狀况</p>
<p>收入：親戚補助費每學期六十元，報章雜誌之稿費每學期叫五十元，餘者賴同學之補助。付出：學費三十五元，宿費爲十元，膳費爲五十元，書籍文具另碎開支的二十五元。</p>
<p>（二）書籍之來源及去途</p>
<p>（一）向同學之父兄及親戚所借；（二）向舊書堆所購。此爲書之來源。其去途則亦分爲二種：（一）借者歸還原主；（二）購者出賣於新生或舊書店。故讀了一年書，一年讀畢後，即一本都沒有了。</p>
<p>（三）紙張簿子之利用</p>
<p>草稿紙每張寫三次：第一决用鉛筆寫，第二次用鋼筆寫，第三决用墨筆寫。練習簿及作文簿等，除略爲添購數本外，全把上學期所未用過或半用過的改釘之。</p>
<p>（四）飲食起居</p>
<p>上午五時起身，下午十時入睡。除讀書工作時間之外，所有剩餘休息時間，祇四五十分鐘。飲食一項，每日除一頓粥二頓飯外，終年不食零食。至於洗衣，大至被褥，小至襪子，都是自己洗的。</p>
<p>以上是我平日的生活情况，其困苦可謂極點。如親戚一旦不補助，則我就不得繼續學業，而稿費收入，又不是絕對有把握的，比之富家之弟，其生活之比例，可謂天堂與地獄。故此稿之作，一方面希望如我一樣的窮學生，都儘可能的刻苦自己的生活；一方面則希望一般富家學生，利用此良好環境努力讀書，勿妄費光陰和金錢。</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>雪花雙蕊</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Winter　Carnival”</p>
<p>「雪花雙蕊」寫一對姊妹花（傑兒巴士德與安恩巴士德)的戀愛故事，而以達特茅斯大學的冬節在歡節爲挿曲。劇作者以姊妹倆不同的遭遇，闡明靑年男女不應以戀愛爲兒戲，意義是很好的，但是在寫作技巧上，不免有若干缺憾。傑兒剛和亞力士公爵離婚，在在歡節中重遇六年前的舊情人，達特茅斯大學的靑年敎授的翰，他們的有情人終成眷屬，情感過程是寫得足够的，但安恩的惑於甜言蜜語，拋棄密蓋，移愛倫鮑格伯爵是太草率了，而且泰格和唐瑞諾士父子記者的奔波，與在歡節的平均發展，也因之削弱了傑兒規勸安恩的力量，同時，使全劇顯得異常鬆散。譬如最後亞力士公爵偕來大批新聞記者探訪傑兒的下落，和溜氷躍高比賽的兼寫，使傑兒和的翰結合，安恩和密蓋言歸於好的高潮，導演者的手忙脚亂是非常明顯的。</p>
<p>就因爲這四條綫的並行發展(傑兒和約翰；安恩和密蓋：泰格和唐瑞諾士；及在歡節）。全劇就不能緊凑地組織起來。最主要的一塲戲，傑兒規勸安恩也祇能在跳舞中敷衍過去了。但也有幾塲很好的戲，如的翰送別傑兒，悽凉空氣很濃厚。的翰和傑兒在友人家中的一夜：揩盆子看護小孩……從側面描寫他們重溫舊夢，也細膩精巧之至。即是傑兒盛裝到跳舞塲中，從安恩懷中奪去倫鮑格伯爵的那塲戲，各人不同的情緒，也寫得很動人。</p>
<p>所謂「唔女郞」安秀麗丹，相反地傑兒這角色演得很好，但據昨日某報的消息，她已被選爲好萊塢四「唔皇后」之一，電影商人的宣傳眞使人有些莫明其妙！</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十六回　謀興醫學造士成庠　思擴村治託兒有所</p>
<p>但是朱村長一向只是吾行吾素，不事宣傳，僅有幾個知道他的人，很欽佩他們的村治得的好，都是實事求是。不知道他的人，終究是不知道，他也不希望人家怎樣的知道，這眞是一位「人不知而不慍」的人了。可是知道自由村的人，已經逐漸加多，在這個從都市裹要疏散到鄉村去的時代間，便有很多人都看中意這個自由村了。譬如何家兩姊妹，最初因爲她父親嫌着上海　　，就想　　抓緊到自由村去的。後來忽然發動了織綢廠的計畫，於是織綢廠就設計開到那裏去了。因爲在這個都市疏散的當兒，也沒有人再想工廠開到上海那裹去。爲的上海地價也貴，工價也貴，一切都覺得不合算咧。自由村旣爲都市疏散的最合宜的地方，於是日漸繁榮，而地租也隨之增多，這是必然之勢。地租之外，便是要講到村營事業了。村營事業中，第一項就要講到集體農塲。自由村有好幾個集體農塲，都是屬於村有的。他們分出了第一集體農塲，第二集體農塲，……直到第七集體農塲。自然這些集體農塲中，有大有小，隨着那地域而區分。可是這一筆收入，實在要算這個農村收入的大部份。單說自由村有好幾個苗圃，一年的淮款就不少，那是有幾位農業專家給經營的。因爲中國內地各省，墾植事業，正在風起雲湧。有許多本來是一片荒地，從來不曾開闢過的。有的是本來原是熟地，却因爲連年戰事，老者轉溝壑，壯者散四方，把土地荒蕪起來的。現在要從新整理起頭，除了稻田麥田之外，就是各處植樹。那一處的土壤，宜於種那一種樹，這不必要怎樣技術高明的農學家，甚而至於中國從前的老農老圃，都可以明白，因此要到各處農塲，去搜求樹苗，一面培植森林，即令從前是個童山濯濯的，此刻也要敎它蔚然成林。朱村長在這一點上，他說自己是個投機家了。因爲他在自由村剛剛組織成立的當兒，他就辦了幾個苗圃。那種苗圃是不要什麼大資本的，隨便闢幾畝荒地，就可以開辦起來。誰知到了現在，自由村的苗國，馳譽於全國，却成了求過於供呢。　（一九一)</p>

<h3>The Focus of the Jin War Still Lies Between Changzi and Changzhi; The Japanese Army Southwest of Changzi Is Wavering; The Chinese Are Taking Advantage of the Situation to Pressure the Suburbs</h3>
<p>Xingji: In the first week of this month, the Japanese army in Changzhi reinforced their forces with 15,000 to 16,000 troops via the Baijin Highway and Dongyangguan. Since the morning of the 8th, they have engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army south of Changzhi and west and south of Changzi. A Japanese force of 3,000 to 4,000 troops, advancing southward along the Handian, Changzhi, and Gaoping highways, suffered heavy losses from the Chinese army's pincer attacks. A unit of over 1,000 troops invaded the vicinity of Yinchengzhen northeast of Gaoping and was again routed by the Chinese on the morning of the 10th. They are currently being encircled and attacked towards Huguan. On the southwest sides of Changzi, the Japanese army wavered completely after bloody battles on the 8th and 9th. The Chinese then took advantage of the situation to pressure the suburbs. The 1,500 Japanese troops in Qin County and Qitingzhen further south have repeatedly harassed and attacked Zhaxianzhen ("Southwest of Qin County"), but have all been repelled by the Chinese. The several hundred Japanese troops in Fucheng southeast of Anze have recently fled southward along the east bank of the Qin River to the Hepingcun area, where the Chinese army is intercepting them. (Dispatch from the 15th)</p>

The Japanese army that invaded westward from Yitaitou was intercepted by the Chinese army in the Youzhucun and Niutoushan areas. Fierce battles raged from the 13th to the 14th, and the Japanese army, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated to Qingxiang and Kechengzhen. The Japanese army that invaded Xixian retreated eastward in disarray after the Chinese army cleared the Japanese troops in the villages and towns of Yiquan and Huangtu. The Chinese army is currently advancing towards Kecheng. (Dispatch from the 15th)</p>

He warned the people of Zhongshan that if they resume anti-Japanese activities, Japanese aircraft will bomb government and military buildings. He also warned the people not to live within 300 meters of these buildings. The Japanese army respects the father of the Republic of China and will not bomb the village where Sun Yat-sen was born. If necessary, "Japanese aircraft can easily destroy the entire Zhongshan area within an hour." (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Sihui: The 300 or so Japanese troops in Huicheng attacked Huadashan, Meishan, and Liantang on the 12th. The Chinese defenders launched a fierce counterattack.

<h3>Soviet Union Continues to Pursue Active Policies in the Far East; Soviet-German Rapprochement Weakens Japan's Position; Negotiations on Japanese-Soviet Issues Have Not Yet Begun</h3>
<p>Paris: Political figures here recently stated that the Soviet Union has not abandoned its active policies towards the Far East. After concluding a non-aggression treaty with Germany at the end of August, it unexpectedly signed a ceasefire agreement with Japan on the Nomonhan border. This action was in stark contrast to the protracted negotiations in the past (the Japanese-Soviet fisheries negotiations being one example), which surprised the general public. At the time, the German side explained that this was a victory for its foreign policy because the Soviet Union, being adjacent to Japan, could unite with Germany to fully address various issues in the West. There were even rumors that Japan and the Soviet Union would hold further wide-ranging negotiations to resolve various outstanding issues. However, in reality, these negotiations have not yet begun, and the Soviet government has closed its consulates in various occupied areas of China, apparently intending to provide substantial assistance to the Chinese Nationalist government. The recent victories of the Chinese army in northern Hunan are, to some extent, due to the Soviet Union's increased assistance. In this way, the Soviet Union, after approaching Germany, has not only destroyed the Anti-Comintern Pact but has also weakened Japan's position, enabling it to seize extremely great benefits. Even in terms of assisting China, it contradicts the complete cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union that Berlin has been promoting. (Havas dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Last night, political figures here received reports that Ambassador Tōgō Shigenori and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are conducting negotiations on a Soviet-Japanese trade agreement.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reforming the Moral Reformation</h3>
<p>In July of this year, a World Assembly for Moral Rearmament was held in California, USA. The Moral Rearmament movement began in June of last year and was initiated by Dr. Frank Buchman. The first international conference was held in Switzerland, and the one held this summer in the United States was the second conference. There were participants from 30 countries, with 1,500 representatives, of which 14 were Chinese. On July 7, it opened in Pasadena, California; on July 19, a meeting was held in Hollywood; thereafter, an international representative training conference was held in Monterey Peninsula; this newspaper has recorded its grand occasion. It is now heard that the Chinese representatives have returned to Shanghai, and will continue their efforts for the Moral Rearmament movement. As a reporter concerned with the welfare of humanity and the Chinese nation, I hope that this movement will achieve substantial and great results.</p>
<p>The nature of the Moral Rearmament movement transcends national, racial, and class boundaries. It is currently being initiated by the Christian Church as the center of the movement, but its significance also transcends the boundaries of religion. Its stated principles are extremely high, and its target is extremely broad. However, the beginning of the movement comes from small actions in one's own life. The standard of living it sets is fourfold: absolute honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love. The primary task is to reform oneself, and then extend this to others. Therefore, the movement's goals are threefold: new individuals, a new nation, and a new world. In terms of the theoretical basis and program, it is similar to the ancient sages' meaning of being sincere in one's intentions, rectifying one's heart, cultivating one's character, managing one's family, governing one's state, and bringing peace to all under heaven; it also particularly aligns with Chairman Chiang's New Life Movement. All movements that are based on truth and justice, and that embrace the goal of benefiting the people and saving the world, not only do not contradict each other, but also lead to the same destination by different paths. The New Life Movement is advocated from above, and the Moral Rearmament movement is promoted from below, and both take personal practice as the creed of effectiveness.</p>
<p>Whether one is honest or not lies in one's intention. Whether something is right or wrong, good or evil, is discerned by knowledge. In terms of intention, who does not begin with sincerity? In terms of knowledge, who does not distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil? However, among the multitude of people, there are vast discrepancies in morality. This is because some people, due to a selfish thought, only seek to benefit themselves, and find that being honest is disadvantageous or inconvenient to themselves, and that doing good is disadvantageous or inconvenient to themselves. Therefore, they betray their sincerity and do wrong. Those who can disregard gains and losses, and are sincere from beginning to end, and are committed to doing good, are moral people who adhere to the creed of personal practice. In short, without personal practice, there is no way to demonstrate sincerity, which is the same as being dishonest. Without personal practice, there is no way to clarify knowledge, which is the same as being ignorant. This is true for individuals, for the society formed by interactions between people, and for the international community formed by interactions between countries. It has been said that during the year since the launch of the Moral Rearmament movement, there was a story in Europe: Bill Rowl, a British man, was the leader of more than 400,000 unemployed workers. After being unemployed for seven years, he deeply resented the privileged class and cursed capitalism. However, calling on the masses and shouting in the streets only revealed the contradictions of the real society. The suffering in his heart was even greater than the pain of unemployment, and he wandered around unable to find a solution. Then, there was Phillip More, a nobleman who was dissatisfied with the greed and corruption of the privileged class. He was moved to deeply enter the ranks of the unemployed, spending three weeks day and night with Bill Rowl, sharing his heart and soul, and sharing his joys and sorrows. Finally, they both discovered the futility of resentment and recognized that the key lies in absolute honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love. Self-examination and personal practice can reveal the light, happiness, and value of life. This conclusion spread far and wide and became a popular story, greatly promoting the Moral Rearmament movement.</p>
<p>While Europeans and Americans see it as a good story, Chinese society may not be able to sense its underlying meaning. Upon careful observation of general Chinese society, one can find signs of moral denial, which is even more pronounced in urban areas, especially among shallow young people with a smattering of knowledge. These people are not unaware of the terms and theories of morality, but they do not believe that there are truly moral people and events, nor do they take morality as the guide for their behavior. Instead, they believe that it is acceptable to deceive and feign, and they take selfishness and self-interest as a matter of course. They do not see this as their own immorality and imagine that everyone else is equally immoral. Even worse, they consider being good at deception and being skilled at pursuing personal gain as the secret to success in life. These people are not all in cities, nor are they all young, nor do they make up a large proportion of the general population, but if they are not stopped, not attacked, and not corrected, then they may become a habit and spread like a contagious disease. For this reason, we especially hope that those who engage in the Moral Rearmament movement will practice it personally and achieve practical and great results!</p>
<h3>German Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Acknowledges Hope for Peace Not Extinguished; Hopes Neutral Countries Can Mediate; US Statement States No Formal Request Received from Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman announced yesterday afternoon that a possible mediation to end the war might still have a glimmer of hope, but the German side will no longer offer guarantees or suggestions. Chamberlain clearly stated in his recent speech that the British government no longer trusts Germany's suggestions, and under these circumstances, continuing to make suggestions would be futile. The spokesman concluded that if a possible mediation is carried out, then Germany and all countries participating in the war should implement the same demobilization, and the participating countries must accept the same conditions before mediation can begin.

<p>Washington: According to President Roosevelt's secretary, O'Leary, Germany has not formally invited the United States to mediate the war in Europe. According to the headlines in New York newspapers, many prominently featured "The United States Disregards Germany's Request for Mediation." However, according to O'Leary, this headline is not in line with the facts, because Germany has not actually requested the President of the United States to mediate the European war.

<h3>Firm Belief in Wartime Goals in British and French Public Opinion; Do Not Be Deceived by Germany's False Peace; Neutral Countries' Press Praises British Prime Minister's Remarks</h3>
<p>London. The "Observer" today carries an article by Mr. Calvin, stating that Britain and France have now resorted to force to defend the world from the tyranny and treachery of barbarians. Before the terror is eliminated, even if it is stopped immediately, Mr. Calvin urges the Allied countries to adhere to their position and not accept a false peace, saying that a truly fair and lasting peace must be built in an international conference. However, this conference should be broader and wiser than the victorious countries' conference hastily convened more than 20 years ago. The principles needed have been outlined in the speeches by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier last week. However, we should not call their declarations a rejection of Hitler's peace proposals, because the conditions proposed by Mr. Hitler are a carefully planned conspiracy, the purpose of which is none other than to maintain his gains and plunge democratic countries into a state of eternal ruin. Mr. Calvin also mentions the documents published in the British Blue Book to prove his arguments, saying that by looking at the contents of these documents, it is clear that Mr. Hitler has a double plan: on the one hand, to destroy Poland, and on the other hand, to lure democratic countries into his trap. However, we, the British Allies, and the whole world, had already seen through this conspiracy before the outbreak of the war, and so on. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris. The opinions of the Paris newspapers all believe that the neutral countries do not take the threat of Germany and the Soviet Union seriously. "Superior News" states that the determination of the Allied countries and the increase in military strength have restored confidence in the small countries and expressed satisfaction with the firmness of the will of Britain and France. "Times" states that Britain and France have won the unanimous support of world opinion, and although Hitler has used all kinds of tricks in the past month, no country has fallen into his trap. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London. Neutral countries' newspapers commented on British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent speech in the House of Commons, praising him and agreeing with the attitude taken by the Allied governments. Many parties said that Hitler's words were untrustworthy, which was the main obstacle to peace. Portugal's "Voice News" said that Hitler's peace offer was still based on a foundation that Britain and France could not accept with honor. Sofia's "Slovo News" solemnly stated that Britain and France were determined to oppose force, and praised Chamberlain's peace efforts. The Swiss newspapers discussed the results of the declarations of Hitler, Daladier, and Chamberlain, and almost unanimously said that peace now depends on Germany behaving itself. The Swedish "Lining Daily News" reviewed the overall situation and said that one thing can now be decided: Germany is now rapidly heading for destruction and will eventually be disappointed.

<h3>Italy's Attitude Towards the European War Is One of Observation, Encouraging the Formation of a Neutral Bloc in Southeastern Europe to Prevent the Continued Expansion of Soviet Influence</h3>
<p>Rome. The Italian government is striving to maintain an attitude of observation towards the current war in Europe, while at the same time stepping up preparations in military and economic terms to be able to cope with all contingencies. However, general public opinion believes that Italy may not be able to maintain its current favorable policy of neutrality for long, and that it may not act as a mediator in the peace offensive launched by German leader Hitler. Judging from the fact that the two Allied countries, Britain and France, refused to negotiate on the basis of accepting the accomplished fact, it is known that it is very difficult to find a solution acceptable to both belligerents for the time being. However, if the scope of the war expands, it will also be unfavorable to Italy. Therefore, Italy is still doing everything possible to prevent the war from expanding. The Italian government is now working hard to encourage the countries of the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River Basin to form a neutral bloc, on the one hand to maintain peace, and on the other hand to resist the political or ideological expansion of communism in those countries. Among them, Hungary and Romania are conducting negotiations under the aegis of Yugoslavia, and are to some extent encouraged by Italy. This is the first step in organizing a neutral bloc. Romania and Bulgaria will also hold talks in the near future, and it is expected that Italy will play an important role at that time. In addition, according to Italy's broad plan, Spain should also be asked to join the neutral bloc. If this action is realized, a very large neutral front with anti-Bolshevik tendencies will be formed from the Balkan Peninsula in the east to the western Mediterranean in the west. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>civil newspaper" viewed the British Prime Minister's speech as clearly rejecting Hitler's peace proposal without using strong words. The newspaper also believed that the speech did not reject all negotiations, but stipulated the specifics of what peace could achieve. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Demands the Cession of Three Small Islands from Finland; Finnish Delegation Returned Home Yesterday for Instructions; Will Also Attend the Four-Nation Nordic Conference</h3>

Well-informed sources expect the Soviet Union to demand three islands in the Gulf of Finland from Finland. They do not believe that the Soviet Union's demands will mention a military alliance. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Finnish Capital. The Finnish delegation, led by Ambassador Basikivi to Sweden, returned to the country last night after holding talks with the Soviet authorities again in Moscow today. According to a message issued by the semi-official Finnish News Agency, the delegation's return to the country does not mean that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland have broken down. According to the Swedish capital's "Aftonbladet," the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland have involved the issue of re-establishing defenses on the island of Åland. The Soviet government believes that if Finland can sign a political agreement with the Soviet government, it will no longer oppose the establishment of defenses on the island of Åland. (According to the Baltic Sea's island of Åland, which is located between Sweden and Finland, at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, and is sufficient to control the Gulf of Finland, its geographical position is extremely important. It is regulated by international conventions that no defensive works can be set up as a military base.) (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital. Today, a telegram was received here from the Finnish capital, stating that although the Finnish government cannot announce the details of the Soviet proposals, it feels that it can continue to discuss them with the Soviet Union. According to general impressions, the discussions between the Soviet Union and Finland will last for a week or more. The Finnish government is now aware of the content of the Soviet proposals and has not shown any signs of panic. The general public is gradually becoming optimistic. However, Finland's precautionary measures are still in progress.</p>
<p>Everyone hopes that Finland's chief representative, Basikivi, will return to Moscow in the coming days, and that a satisfactory compromise can be reached after the discussions. At the same time, the Finnish newspapers all stated that Finland has resolved to reject all conditions that would damage the country's honor, integrity, and independence.

<h3>Soviet Demands Include Four Items</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital. According to as-yet-unconfirmed news from Finland, the Soviet Union's greatest ambitions for Finland include four items: (1) Three small islands opposite the port of Kronstadt and the island of Hogland (the Finnish residents of which have already been evacuated) should be ceded to the Soviet Union. The port of Hanko in the southwest should be leased to the Soviet Union. (2) Regarding the issue of fortifications on the Åland Islands, there is a joint consensus: (A) The Soviet Union requires that the Soviet Union and Finland jointly build fortifications. (B) Finland can build fortifications alone, but on the condition that the Soviet Union and Finland carry out extensive cooperation politically. (3) The Soviet Union and Finland conclude a mutual assistance treaty. (4) Finland's export trade should be organized by the Soviet Union. It is rumored that the Soviet Union will not put forward conditions in the style of an ultimatum. For the time being, the above four items will be the basis for continuing negotiations with Finland. As for the compensation measures that the Soviet Union can offer, the country will cede a small part of the coastal area of Karelia to Finland, and allow the country to use the Soviet Union's Ladoga Lake canal to the White Sea for commercial purposes. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Danish Capital. A reporter from the Maritime News Agency learned tonight from well-informed sources that the Soviet Union has made the following demands on Finland: (1) Finland cedes the islands of Tytärsaari, Lavansaari, Seiskari to the Soviet Union (the island of Suursaari may also be ceded). After Finland cedes the above islands, the Soviet Union will provide territorial compensation in Eastern Karelia. (2) Finland guarantees that it will not build fortifications on the Åland Islands and recognizes that the Soviet Union enjoys temporary control over the islands in order to verify that the islands are not fortified. (3) A military alliance between the Soviet Union and Finland. If Finland is threatened by an unprovoked attack by a third country, the Soviet Union not only has the right to use all its forces to defend Finland, but also has the obligation to defend Finland.</p>
<p>The islands of Tytärsaari, Lavansaari, Seiskari, and Suursaari are all located near the Soviet coast in the Gulf of Finland. Eastern Karelia is Soviet territory bordering Finland's eastern frontier, and its residents are Finnish. After Finland cedes the islands, it will receive territorial compensation in Eastern Karelia.

<p>Finnish Capital. Foreign Minister Erkko issued a statement saying, "The dispute between the Soviet Union and Finland will be resolved peacefully within a few days. The Finnish government will do its best to maintain peace. I firmly believe that the Soviet Union also has the same desire for this issue." The Foreign Minister continued, saying that a defense alliance or the conclusion of any military alliance with any power is out of the question. Finland already has a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Erkko continued, saying that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland have reached a critical juncture. Only the four members of Finland's wartime cabinet, as well as the Finnish President and Chief of Staff, are aware of the plan under consideration. The Foreign Minister declared that he believed that the United States had a very good friendship with Finland. "President Roosevelt's letter to Moscow will be a powerful factor in resolving the current dispute."

If he decides to do so, he will not be allowed to return to Latvia. (2) It is undoubtedly permissible for Germans returning to Germany to take daily necessities out of the country, but movable property with special value and related to Latvia's economic life is prohibited from being taken away.

<p>Berlin. German radio stations and newspapers announced tonight the news that Germany had sunk the British battleship HMS Royal Oak, and said that the British Admiralty had issued an official report admitting that this was the second major loss of the British Navy. (Maritime News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin. German newspapers today reiterated that the British battleship HMS Royal Oak has been sunk by a German submarine. Together with HMS Courageous and HMS Royal Oak, a total of three British battleships have been sunk. The German official news agency issued the following question, "Will Churchill admit the sinking of HMS Royal Oak?" The British announcement of the sinking of HMS Royal Oak was published in the local evening newspapers. A well-known newspaper also said that the success of the German submarine this time can give the British a great lesson. According to unconfirmed news, HMS Royal Oak was sunk off the coast of Spain. The official formal announcement will be issued after the German submarine commander returns. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>London. Naval sources claimed that they were not surprised by the sinking of HMS Royal Oak, as the ship was one of the oldest in the Navy. Such old ships often sail in more dangerous places, but they do not deny the new victory won by the German submarine. "Although HMS Royal Oak was an old ship that had been in use for 25 years, it was one of the Navy's 'sea fortresses' and was considered to be unable to be sunk by the power of ordinary submarines. It had special anti-mine devices. It participated in the Battle of Jutland in the last war and has recently been listed in the Navy's reserve fleet. It rejoined the service in June, commanded by Colonel Benn. In this disaster, Colonel Benn and Lieutenant Colonel Nichols were rescued. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that "the British battleship HMS Royal Oak has been sunk by our submarine, as announced by the country's Admiralty." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>London. According to official news from Berlin, after the British battleship HMS Royal Oak was sunk, several reconnaissance planes from that country attacked Berlin at low altitude last night. The air defense authorities did not issue an alarm, and the anti-aircraft artillery fired fiercely for two hours. At that time, explosions occurred in several places, but the authorities did not allow the radio stations to announce where the locations were. In addition, newspapers in the Swedish capital carried a telegram from a reporter stationed in Berlin stating, "At 9:00 p.m. last night, anti-aircraft fire in Berlin was heavy, and searchlights searched the sky. Residents were terrified and looked out from the windows. It is said that several planes were seen passing over the northern suburbs." The British Air Ministry solemnly denied all of this. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris. Authoritative sources claimed that since the outbreak of the war, the Allied fleet has sunk 17 or 18 German submarines. In addition, several submarines have been attacked, but their fate has not yet been determined. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>New York. The French oil tanker "Miguel" was wrecked in the Atlantic Ocean yesterday. The crew of 39 were rescued by the American freighter "Black Hawk" and will disembark in Boston Harbor. After the "Miguel" was wrecked, the American mail ship "President Harding" received a distress call and sailed to the rescue. When it arrived at the scene, it was on fire, and all the crew had left the ship. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>London. According to German radio reports, Germany will no longer use submarines but will use destroyers to engage in "economic warfare" in the future. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital. People in the shipping industry here attach great importance to the sinking of the British battleship HMS Royal Oak by a German submarine. It is said that the value of the convoy system has been reduced. It is said that the HMS Royal Oak incident once again demonstrates the strict organization of the German submarine war and the excellent skills of the submarine sailors, and has created a turning point in naval warfare. (Maritime News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The General Headquarters recently issued a communique stating, "Last night, in a certain place in the north of our army, the sound of aircraft engines was heard, and our anti-aircraft artillery immediately fired." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin. According to official sources here last night, an aircraft of unknown nationality flew very high over Berlin last night, so only the sound of the engine could be heard. The anti-aircraft artillery in northwest Berlin fired at the plane twice for 15 minutes each time, and searchlights shone brightly to try to find the location of the fuselage. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>London. According to the British Air Ministry's statement to the Associated Press reporter today, the rumors that there was an aircraft of unknown nationality over Berlin last night were related to the British Air Force. The Air Ministry had no knowledge of this. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>Western Front German Forces Complete Offensive Preparations New German Troops Arrive at Siegfried Line Artillery Battles Southwest of Saarbrücken</h3>
<p>London According to reports from neutral observers, Berlin is now prepared in every way to move Hitler's office to the Western Front. The offensive by German forces may begin by the end of this week. The necessary preliminary attacks have almost been completed. French observers also say that new troops have arrived at the Siegfried Line. A large number of German troops are gathered at the corner formed by Luxembourg, the Moselle, and the Rhine, ready to launch an offensive at any time. However, the area is narrow and mountainous, making a long, direct advance difficult. Furthermore, the French defenses are strong. If the German forces attack from there, the price they pay will definitely be shockingly high. Therefore, some observers predict that the German forces will attack simultaneously through the Netherlands and Switzerland in order to分散 the Allied powers' resistance. Currently, the German position seems to be divided. The biggest factor determining everything is the internal situation in Germany. The domestic population now hopes for significant developments. However, whatever decision Hitler makes, the British and French commanders have confidence that they can inflict heavy damage on the German forces. The command and training of the British and French armies are considered superior to that of the German forces. The equipment of the British and French armies is at least equal to that of the German forces, and the French trenches and fortifications from Lauterbourg to the Siegfried Line are even stronger than during the last World War. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London Reuters military correspondent reports that the "probing" war on the Western Front could turn into a major war at any time, and the stubborn German military may drive large forces to attack the Allied defense lines. However, it is difficult to solve the problem of when and where the mechanized units gathered behind the front line can be moved out to attack points where resistance is weaker than it is now. Currently, due to rainy and foggy weather, there is little activity. The German forces were quite active before the strikes, aiming to discover the location of the British Expeditionary Force and British aircraft, but this activity has now decreased and ultimately failed to achieve anything. The correspondent heard from extremely reliable sources that Germany must leave at least twenty divisions stationed in Poland. Young conscripts belonging to the National Socialist Party have now been transferred to the Western Front. However, the German army now has many shortcomings not seen in the German army of Emperor Wilhelm in 1914. The German army has expanded from seven divisions to ninety divisions in four years, so there is a severe shortage of experienced officers, while the British and French have more experienced officers than before. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>British Army Positions in French Territory France's strong defense line today is truly the only great construction after the Great Wall of China. British army units have joined the fighting on this line, stationed in important locations between the English Channel and Switzerland. A reporter visited the front lines of the British army positions. Every few yards along the way, there was a small fort made of steel and cement. Such facilities were only found in a few places in the Verdun positions during the last World War. British troops on the front lines are all digging trenches to build even stronger defenses. Farmers continue to farm. I met an optimistic farmer in one place, scattering seeds for next year. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris General Headquarters has just released war bulletin number eighty-one, stating, "Enemy reconnaissance units were very active today in the area west of the Saar River and south of Zweibrücken. They were all repelled by our forces. In addition, there was heavy artillery fire between both sides southwest of Saarbrücken." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam A correspondent from a local newspaper in Berlin reports that general opinion in Germany is that Germany will strive to avoid a large-scale conflict, so there will be extremely important decisions made during the next week. The correspondent also states that what Germany welcomes most at the moment is the cessation of any major oppressive threat from the Western Front. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin The German High Command issued a communiqué this afternoon stating briefly that there were no changes in the Eastern Front situation, and there was a slight artillery battle on the Western Front. Near Breitenfeldt, German forces shot down an aircraft on the 13th. There was no significant activity by either side's air forces on the 14th. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<h3>Warsaw After the War Gradually Returns to Normal</h3>
<p>Berlin A correspondent from a German newspaper stationed in Warsaw, having returned to the city, sent a report today on the situation in Warsaw after the war, stating briefly that life in Warsaw is now gradually returning to normal under German administration. Obstacles hindering traffic, barbed wire, etc., have all been removed, and ditches have also been filled in. The most difficult problem, drinking water, has been solved by the German authorities. Engineers are repairing water pipes everywhere. There are no problems with the water supply in the main areas of the city. Electricity is available in several areas, and buses can be used. Railway traffic is gradually recovering. Freight cars loaded with grain arrive in Warsaw every day, so wartime prices have gradually decreased. City traffic has not yet fully recovered. Only two bus routes are in operation, but trams have not yet returned. According to the correspondent, the German authorities are currently engaged in relief work, hoping to restore normal conditions this winter. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<h3>French Air Force Activity Limited to Reconnaissance Has Not Yet Engaged in Bombing</h3>
<p>Paris The authorities have recently announced the activities of the French Air Force since the start of the war, measuring and reconnaissance, never engaged in bombing. German aircraft have also not bombed French territory, but only engaged in reconnaissance. However, their reconnaissance planes are often intercepted by our fighter planes shortly after leaving their base, so they have not been able to complete their mission. Our reconnaissance planes, day and night, penetrate deep into German airspace to carry out reconnaissance. From the third of last month to the seventh of this month, daytime reconnaissance totaled more than two hundred times, and nighttime reconnaissance totaled sixty times. Although enemy fighter planes have attacked, our planes have still been able to take many photos of the German Siegfried Line and German military positions, and have been able to report the concentration of German troops to our General Headquarters. In a word, the results are extremely good. As for the air combat situation between the enemy and our forces, our pilots have excellent skills, and the quality of our aircraft is also superior to that of the enemy's. A total of twenty-four enemy planes have been shot down, and our losses are only eight planes. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>German Finances Adapt to Wartime Needs Industrial Production Declines</h3>
<p>Berlin According to the "German General Report," Germany has been able to meet wartime needs and maintain currency stability by using increased taxes, savings, and funds from savings banks and insurance companies. During the last World War, Germany promulgated the first wartime tax law five years after the outbreak of the war. Three-quarters of the war expenses, amounting to a huge sum of 130,000,000,000 marks, were paid with public debt. The current German budget has implemented savings and reduced various non-essential expenditures. According to Deputy Finance Minister Lienhardt, the issuance of wartime public debt is not currently being considered. Germany is good at issuing treasury bonds, absorbing excess funds, and supplying war expenses, and the amount of paper money in circulation will not increase significantly due to wartime needs. People's savings are also not threatened due to the stability of wages and prices. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<p>New York A certain German economist published an article in the steel industry publication "Iron Age," predicting that the German industrial system would collapse in four to eight months due to a lack of raw materials and exorbitant labor costs. He said that Germany lacks important raw materials such as pig iron, fuel, machinery, gasoline, copper, wheat, and cotton, and that domestic workers are fatigued and undernourished, resulting in a gradual decrease in the per capita output of various manufactured goods or raw materials. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Vienna German Economics Minister Funk delivered a speech here yesterday to representatives of the industrial sector, discussing Germany's wartime economy, declaring that Britain's blockade policy had completely failed, that the German people's economic life had not been affected in the slightest, and that Germany not only had other ways to obtain the raw materials it needed, but also had domestic substitutes, so that it would not be completely dependent on foreign supplies. In addition to military "armament expansion," the German government also had economic "armament expansion," increasing relations with Southeastern European countries to ensure that even if the war was prolonged, Germany could maintain 80% of its peacetime foreign trade."

<h3>British Merchant Ship Convoy System Successful British Ships That Have Been Convoied Have Never Suffered Aerial Attacks</h3>
<p>London Germany now admits that the submarine warfare aimed at destroying British shipping has been defeated by the convoy system, but says that German aircraft can make up for the shortcomings of submarines. According to observers here, since Britain implemented the convoy system, ships that have been convoyed have never suffered aerial attacks, showing that Germany's claim that aerial bombing can sweep away British maritime power has not become a reality. As for the claim that British destroyers are intercepting and searching Japanese ships in Japanese territorial waters, it is even more absurd. After exercising maritime power for hundreds of years, the British naval authorities would never neglect their duties and deliberately offend a country that has declared strict neutrality. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London The Information Department recently stated that British ships now entering and leaving British ports are protected at sea by the British Air Force for hundreds of miles. Even in the past few weeks, when there have been storms and rain and poor visibility, the escort work of British reconnaissance planes has not been greatly interrupted. When there are heavy storms and rain, the British planes escorting merchant ships sometimes fly very low, and the crew members watch the sea and sky. As soon as they see a submarine, they drop bombs to drive it away, and they notify British warships to sail to the location and drop depth charges again. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Danzig It is now known that four German pilots landed yesterday in the Rugpin area. The plane they were flying had been shot down by British planes. It is said that this German plane initially fought with British planes outside British territorial waters and then, unable to withstand the attack of the British planes, landed off the Danish coast. At that time, the British plane signaled to a Danish ship to rescue the German pilots who had fallen into the sea. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>British and French Aircraft Production Exceeds Germany</h3>
<p>London An Information Department statement said that it can now be predicted that when the industrial mobilization of Britain and France is completed, they will be able to build five times more aircraft than usual. This is a fact and not an overly optimistic exaggeration. Even if Germany accelerates the production of its aircraft factories to the extreme limit, the aircraft produced by Britain and France will still be three times that of Germany. The French aircraft industry will soon employ more than 300,000 workers. The statement mentioned the situation in the Western Front, saying that neither French nor German aircraft have dropped a single bomb in the Western Front. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Flies Over Dutch Airspace</h3>

<h3>US Congress to Discuss Two-Ocean Navy Plan Navy Department Collects Various Materials</h3>
<p>Washington Judging by various events, the US Congress will discuss the US two-ocean navy plan at its next meeting, that is, to defend the coastlines of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the same time. The Navy Department is now studying the convenience of public and private shipyards in realizing this plan and will submit the materials obtained to a special committee of Congress for research. It is said that the Navy does not hope to split the US Navy in two, fearing that Congress will question the truth of the matter, so it first starts with collecting facts. Furthermore, the US two-ocean navy plan was generated because of the European war. According to the views of some strategists, the United States should first concentrate its fleet in the Pacific and then quickly build up its fleet in the Atlantic. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>American Security Zone Must Not Be Violated Senator Pepper Talks</h3>
<p>Washington Democratic Senator Pepper stated today that the security zone stipulated in the Panama Declaration should be fully patrolled and policed by American democratic nations so that the warring nations recognize that the American nations are not easy to deal with. "If the warships of the warring nations deliberately violate the American security zone, they should be detained. In fact, however, I believe that all submarines, cruisers, and other warships that violate this security zone should be sunk." The Panama Declaration has clearly stated that if the warships of the warring nations violate this area, the warring nations themselves must bear the responsibility for the danger.

<h3>Japan Hopes US Will Initiate Renewal of Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Tokyo According to Ginjiro Fujiwara, chairman of the Japan Industrial Federation, who recently arrived in the United States from Europe, speaking to a reporter from the Nichinichi Shimbun, Japan should not immediately contact the United States to renew a new commercial treaty at present. Fujiwara asked Japanese businessmen to prepare for the complete abolition of the Japan-US commercial treaty and to wait quietly for the time to ripen to sign a new commercial treaty with the United States. Fujiwara believes that Japan does not need to rush to sign a new Japan-US commercial treaty. It is best for the United States to initiate it, not Japan. In any case, Japan must grit its teeth and wait for the opportunity to come. Moreover, when the United States initiates a request to Japan to sign a new commercial treaty, if the conditions it proposes do not satisfy the Japanese side, the Japanese side can reject them until satisfactory conditions are obtained.

<h3>German Labor Exchanges Established in Polish Territory</h3>
<p>Berlin An official from the German Labor Department published an article in the "German Labor Report" describing the achievements of the German labor exchanges in Polish territory. These exchanges were quickly established in various parts of Poland following the German army. On the third day after the outbreak of the war, a German labor exchange was established in Rybnik in Upper Silesia, Poland. By September 8, the number of exchanges had increased to nineteen. It increased to thirty on September 18, and to seventy at the end of September. Currently, there are a total of 115. Polish farmers were transported to various parts of Germany at the end of September to help with the autumn harvest. As of October 14, there were a total of 120,000 Polish farmers in Germany. Technical workers from the industrial areas of Upper Silesia and Olsza have been assigned to wartime industrial workers. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<h3>US Isolationist Congressmen Propose Requesting British and French Territories to Offset War Debts A Heated Debate in the Senate</h3>
<p>Washington In yesterday's Senate meeting, because isolationists proposed asking Britain and France to cede their territories in the Western Hemisphere to the United States as compensation for war debts, Minnesota Senator Lundeen, an extreme isolationist, said, "If those Allied nations do not repay their war debts, the United States will send troops to occupy the West Indies." North Carolina Democratic Senator Reynolds even proposed occupying Newfoundland and part of Canada. Texas Democratic Senator Connally immediately rose to attack those isolationists, saying that they wanted to drag the United States into the whirlpool of war. Kentucky Democratic Senator Barkley called the isolationists' remarks "cowardly," "Why not do it in peacetime, but want to seize it during wartime?" Washington Democratic Senator Schwellenbach said that this was similar to Molotov's demands on the Baltic states. North Dakota Republican Senator Frazier attacked the neutrality law amendment proposed by President Roosevelt again, saying that this amendment would drag the United States into the war. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman issued a formal document yesterday attacking the remarks of aviator Lindbergh. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>

<h3>Under the Heavy Burden of War, Cracks Appear in the Japanese Economy</h3>
<p>The *Millard's Review* recently published an article by John Ahlers regarding the economic strain Japan is experiencing during its invasion of China. A translation is provided below:</p>
<p>Japanese militarists have formulated a model for Japan's economic policy, primarily aimed at promoting the military, both domestically and on the Asian continent. This policy is becoming increasingly solidified. Although the Hiranuma Cabinet fell six weeks ago, its economic policies continue to be implemented. This is because Aokii, the president of the Planning Board and a key representative of this policy, has recently been appointed Minister of Finance. It's clear that Aokii is neither an independent economist nor a representative of Japanese big business, but rather a tool of the military. He may even rise to the level of an active duty commander within the General Staff.</p>
<p>The current Minister of the Army, Shunroku Hata, has made sweeping changes among key military personnel within the Army Ministry and various Japanese Army commands. This suggests that the military figures dominating affairs in Tokyo are not likely to gain any new perspectives on the Japanese economy. The military, accustomed to commanding soldiers and seeing them blindly obey, completely fails to understand that it's impossible to similarly command industry, goods, prices, exchange rates, and other economic elements without creating chaos. For two years, the military has attempted to reshape the Japanese economy, altering its foundations and structure, forcing it to develop in a one-sided manner, establishing more war industries, and restricting development in other areas. As the war against China progresses, the military's demands on the economy and its interference have steadily increased, leading to growing economic difficulties for Japan. The military appears to be blind to this fact. The Abe government has only just begun to take new action on one aspect of the economy. Many knowledgeable Japanese people are aware that Japan's economic difficulties are increasing daily. Hiranuma had prohibited all public reporting on Japan's economic hardship, absolutely forbidding newspapers from publishing the true problems facing Japan. However, the new Prime Minister, Abe, seems to feel that the difficulties are so numerous that they can no longer be ignored. In fact, Abe seems to have decided to publicize these difficulties so that the Japanese people can prepare for another major sacrifice. Apparently for this reason, the financial sections of major Japanese newspapers are filled with news of increasing shortages of goods, with little other news. They also explicitly state the need for further restrictions on civilian consumption and tighter government economic controls. These reports give the impression that things were going relatively smoothly under Hiranuma's rule, but under Abe's administration, Japan's economic situation seems to be worsening. This impression is, of course, inaccurate, as Abe is simply revealing what his predecessor had concealed. However, the full truth about Japan's economic and financial straits has yet to be announced. In the initial stages of its invasion of China, the Japanese people readily accepted restrictions. Millions of obedient Japanese people discarded leather shoes and returned to wearing traditional wooden clogs. They wore clothing made of mixed fibers without much complaint and managed to forgo familiar imported goods. The masses' lives were not greatly affected by the war. The entire nation expected a quick, easy, and inexpensive victory over China, as promised by the military. They not only expected all economic abnormalities to disappear soon, but also looked forward to a steady stream of war spoils and an economic boom. However, after more than two years of war, economic improvement has remained elusive. Worse still, the existing economic difficulties have gradually increased. It is only natural that the Japanese masses are beginning to express genuine alarm about the situation.</p>
<p>Now, Abe has allowed the controlled press to publicly disclose material shortages, which deeply affect the daily lives of every Japanese person. Restrictions must be placed on household consumption of coal, electricity, gas, and paper. The Japanese Empire has also begun to clearly understand the shortage of food. Rice, sugar, eggs, and canned goods are now being rationed to the public daily by the government. The price level rose sharply in August and September, but ordinances have prohibited increases in wages and salaries at a time when they have not yet been adjusted to the new price level. Although newspapers continue to carry illusory reports of victories in China, they cannot dispel the despairing situation that Japan finds itself in. It is no longer easy to hope that the Japanese people will feel that this news compensates for the new difficulties they are experiencing.</p>
<p>The Abe Cabinet has implemented new economic control regulations, with the number of regulations far exceeding the number of days since the new Abe government took office. The new forms of restrictions are the same. Regarding the newly controlled goods, the Army and Navy departments first requisition the supplies they need or believe they will need. When allocating the remaining items, war industries have a definite priority. The worst affected are peacetime industries and civilian consumption. However, it is peacetime industries and peaceful consumption that truly support Japan. The electricity supply to the textile industry, which has long suffered, has been greatly reduced, resulting in a sharp drop in the production of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and rayon in recent weeks. The daytime electricity supply to spinning mills in the Nagoya area has been completely cut off. Its operations have had to be limited to midnight, when the general public's need for electricity is minimal. The government, which had long opposed the merger of textile factories, is now suddenly encouraging it. As a result, some factories may close, while the remaining ones will be transformed into new, first-class factories. The newspapers are now urging civilians to become "greater and better patriots," tighten their belts, go to bed early, not burn too many lights, and economize on everything. However, everyone must save even more money and deposit it in savings banks so that the Ministry of Finance can use these funds to subscribe to war and national debt bonds. An imperial ordinance issued on October 6 aims to curb the recent rise in prices. According to these orders, all prices, such as wages, salaries, rent, and freight, must not exceed the levels of September 18. The government reserves the right to permit exceptions to exceed this level. These sudden measures are based on a request made by former Minister of the Army Itagaki months ago, despite the strong opposition of Ikeda, Chairman of the Central Commodity Committee, the former Minister of Finance and a close associate of Matsui. Ikeda is now an outstanding representative of Japan's private high finance sector. This indicates that the military has finally prevailed over Ikeda and shows what forces control the Abe government's economic policies. However, the new price control plan will absolutely not cure the root cause of rising prices, so it is bound to fail. The government accuses merchants of hoarding and raising prices for speculative purposes, which may be partly true. However, there are many fundamental reasons for the recent surge in prices in Japan. The main reasons are that the general public has become aware of the increasing shortage of goods in Japan, the depreciation of the yen following the pound, and the increasing trend of inflation. At the end of last month, prices in Japan rose to the highest level since the outbreak of the war, and the amount of banknotes in circulation at the Bank of Japan reached a new high for the year, exceeding 2.6 billion yen. These two events are certainly not coincidental. The official announcement by the Bank of Japan of currency reserves is 500.1 million yen. Many well-informed sources believe that these reserves have already been depleted. Even if the Bank of Japan still has 500.1 million yen in reserves, the yen's reserves have fallen to 12%, far less than half of the legal tender reserves based on the current exchange rate in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese militarists do not understand that it is not the Japanese economy that is creating the difficulties, but rather the military situation they themselves have created that has exacerbated Japan's economic hardship. Because the mass production of military supplies to supply the domestic and Chinese land and naval forces, the productive peacetime industries are subordinate to the unproductive wartime industries. Thus Japan is experiencing a shortage of goods. Japan is currently financing its adventurous war in China through continuous expansion of national debt. This is the reason for Japanese inflation. The fundamental cause of Japan's economic hardship is the Chinese war. This has placed an unbearable burden on the Japanese economy. Japanese militarists are attempting to accomplish what their nation's economic structure and resources cannot support. This is why the previously stable Japanese economy now shows dangerous cracks. The actions of the Japanese militarists are indeed too reckless.</p>
<h3>Singapore Government Restricts Import of Goods, a Total of Thirty-Four Items Intended to Control Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>A Hong Kong dispatch: In recent years, Chinese manufacturers have shipped a large volume of goods to Singapore and other ports in Southeast Asia for sale. However, since the outbreak of the European war, the Singapore government has suddenly announced a ban on the import of thirty-four categories of goods. Manufacturers in Hong Kong are greatly concerned about this, as most of the products made in Hong Kong are sold in Singapore and the islands of Southeast Asia. Once imports are banned, it would be equivalent to placing manufacturers in a death trap. Therefore, they have been sending telegrams to their agents in Singapore to inquire about the details. Yesterday, the manager of a factory said that he had received a report from Singapore stating that this move by the Straits Settlements government was merely a step to assist in controlling foreign exchange. Merchants in the area who wish to handle Hong Kong goods only need to obtain a permit from the import and export bureau, and they can handle the goods as usual without any difficulties. In reality, the local government does not completely prohibit the import of these thirty-four categories of goods, but only imposes certain restrictions. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Manufacturers Association has called a special meeting to discuss countermeasures. The attendees were very enthusiastic. The thirty-four categories of restricted goods are listed in detail below: (1) Taxable beverages and tobacco, (2) Animals not for food, (3) Non-metallic minerals and petroleum-based minerals, (4) Raw cotton, (5) Other textile raw materials, (6) Pottery, glass, and non-cement and glass jars, etc., (7) Non-iron products, etc., (8) Electrical appliances, (9) Machinery, (10) Cotton thread and products, (11) Wool products, (12) Silk and silk fabrics, (13) Other textile manufacturing raw materials, excluding Manila hemp, (14) Clothing, (15) Pharmaceuticals, (16) Leather and products, (17) Vehicles, (18) Rubber products, (19) Bracelets, (20) Artificial pearls, (21) Furniture, (22) Antiques, (23) All cosmetic products, (24) Artificial flowers, (25) Gold thread, (26) Imitation gold and silver leaf, (27) Jewels and goldsmith supplies, (28) Paint supplies, (29) Lamps and lanterns, etc., (30) Various musical supplies, (31) Perfumes, powders, etc., (32) Paintings, (33) Silversmith supplies, (34) Silver thread, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding item 15 in the table, the scope of "pharmaceuticals" reportedly only refers to manufactured drugs, and does not include raw Chinese medicinal materials.</p>
<h3>Suzhou People Suffering from Extreme Hardship</h3>
<p>High Prices Make Life Difficult</p>
<p>A Suzhou dispatch: Prices for various goods in Suzhou have recently skyrocketed, increasing people's consumer expenses and causing great hardship. According to investigations, the current selling prices of several daily necessities are one to two times higher than at the same time last year, and in some cases, even more than three times higher. For example, kerosene was selling for seven yuan per box last year. This year it once rose to twenty yuan and five jiao. Retail prices have also risen from twenty-odd fen to about sixty fen per jin. Although there has been some relaxation in recent days, the market price is still seventeen yuan, so the retail price is still about fifty fen per jin. As a result, many families have switched to candles or oil lamps. However, their prices have also continued to rise like kerosene. Every year, after autumn arrives, firewood and grass, made from rice straw and tree branches, can be used as fuel, so the market price should be lower this autumn. Now, however, the prices are even higher than in the summer, exceeding one time. Even thatch is in short supply. Rice straw used to be two hundred jin per yuan, but now it is only one hundred and twenty jin per yuan. Rolled tobacco, such as Pisi cigarettes, has also soared in price. As for vegetables, pork was three jin per yuan in the same period last year, but now it is only two jin and four liang per yuan. Due to a lack of raw materials, the rapeseed produced in various rural areas has been almost completely absorbed. Furthermore, the transportation of goods from Zhejiang and Anhui has been hindered, and sources are scarce, making oil production difficult. Oil is now also becoming increasingly scarce, while demand is increasing. Salt is now fifty yuan per dan at the market, and five jiao per jin for door-to-door sales. Due to transportation disruptions from the production area, goods are not easy to obtain. From the first day of the ninth lunar month, after discussion among industry members, the prices of various Shaoxing wines have been increased by two yuan and four jiao per dan, and retail prices have been increased by two fen and four li per jin. The prices for Jing Zhuang is nineteen yuan and two jiao, Bamboo Green is twenty yuan, Hua Diao is twenty-two yuan and four jiao, Aged is twenty-four yuan, Shao Jiu is twenty-one yuan and six jiao, Gaoliang is twenty-five yuan and six jiao, Yanghe is thirty-two yuan, Xilu is forty-eight yuan, Yuanliang is sixty-four yuan, Top Yuan is eighty yuan, and White Rose is twenty-six yuan and four jiao. Because the prices of daily necessities have soared, the general public is constantly complaining.</p>
<h3>Nanhui, the Chinese Army Recaptures Datuan</h3>
<p>The Puppet Army of Jiang Rebels and a Japanese Army Captain is Killed</p>
<p>A Pudong dispatch: Since the provincial government sent Xia Lvzhao to take over as the magistrate of Nanhui County, the original magistrate Yu Taosheng and the leader of the Chuansha Guerrilla, Li Zhiming, resigned one after another. Their 8,000 troops were handed over to Ding Xishan. On the morning of the 9th, Ding's troops counterattacked Datuan. Jiang Guiqing, a former bandit recruited by the Japanese army, suddenly led his troops and shouted, "We are Chinese, rise up quickly and fight to the death with the XXXXX!" As a result, the Japanese troops occupying Datuan were cut off from front to back, unable to coordinate. Because the situation was sudden, the Japanese army could not respond and trampled on each other. Ding's troops, with Jiang's troops as their inside support, were unstoppable. They completely recaptured Datuan Town. Japanese army captain Fujimori was also killed. Jiang's troops have now been reorganized into the Ninth Detachment by Ding Xishan.</p>

<h3>World Shipping Market Conditions</h3>
<p>— Qinhuai Bi</p>
<p>Outbreak of European War and Shipping Market Conditions</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the long-stagnant world shipping industry has suddenly shown a reversal posture. The soaring freight and ship rentals for long-distance ocean routes are like those at the outbreak of the First European War.</p>
<p>The following is a list of freight rates on the world's major tramp vessel routes, which are the most sensitive to market conditions, to show the general situation of soaring prices. (Unit: Shilling)</p>
<p>(Note) Freight rates from the Far East to Europe and from Europe to the Far East have increased by about 20%.</p>
<p>Looking at the grain freight rates on the world's standard route, South America Liverpool to Europe: initially from 10 shillings to 30 shillings. According to the telegram on September 7, it will rise to 40 shillings. According to the telegram on October 11 and 2, it is said that it will soar to 50 shillings. Ship charter rates have also become active accordingly. According to the telegram on September 9, the six-month charter rate for small West Indian ferry ships in the New York market is 3 US dollars, but according to the telegram on October 11, it is said that all charter rates originally set at 1.75 US dollars are now changed to 4.75 US dollars. This surge has made the world shipping market rate more than six times hotter than before the war. In the future, it is inevitable that the sea market will continue to maintain a gradual upward pace.</p>
<p>As of September 18, the freight rates for the world's major routes are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>A. Comparison Table of Freight Rates on Major Routes Before and After the European War. The soaring freight rates on major routes can be seen in general. In short, tramp vessels have generally increased by one time, while scheduled vessels have increased from 20% to 50%. However, it is speculated that there may not be excessive changes in the future.</p>
<p>The European War is continuing, and governments of various countries are considering in detail the price countermeasures that should be taken to cope with the current difficulties. However, these kinds of countermeasures are fundamentally different from the policies promoted under the free economy during the First European War, which can be expected. At least like during the First World War, it would cost 600 shillings to transport rice from Saigon to Europe and 270 shillings to transport miscellaneous grains from Plata to Europe. This kind of madness is unlikely to reappear.</p>
<p>British Freight Countermeasures</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the outbreak of the European War, the British government, in order to ensure the transportation of its troops and important wartime materials, organized a chartering committee on the one hand, and took measures to deal with the wartime economy on the other hand, and made every effort to focus on suppressing prices at home. As for the soaring freight rates, it is certainly necessary to try its best to prevent and mitigate them. That is to say, for freight rates from the Philippines to New York that want to increase by 50%, only an increase of 25% is allowed; from Singapore to New York that wants to increase by 50%, only an increase of 20% is allowed; Australia to Europe 25%, Manila to Hong Kong or Shanghai is also 25%. In addition, the British government has also determined the official freight rates for grains. On the other hand, for the huge maritime relief plan proposed in Parliament on July 13 as a five-year plan, it advocated strengthening it; for the transfer of the world shipping center market from London to New York, which is sufficient to weaken the guiding position, it strongly opposed it; Therefore, the British government is engaged in strengthening work, sparing no effort, in order to impose severe sanctions on the New York market. For example, the government has officially set the freight rate for miscellaneous grains from Plata to Europe at 30 shillings, and the same is true for ship charter rates. As for the charter rate regulations for domestic ships, large ships are 7 shillings 6 pence to 6 shillings 6 pence. This is a good plan for the British government, but most shipowners are dissatisfied. Later, according to a certain intelligence, the United Kingdom will set up a Ministry of Shipping in the cabinet. Although we do not quite understand what the effect of the first institution and its operation will be, it is certainly not without reason for a major power that has fully experienced the previous world war to suddenly add this Ministry of Shipping.</p>
<p>Increased Maritime War Insurance Rates</p>
<p>In addition to the soaring freight and ship charter rates mentioned above, maritime war insurance rates are also increasing. Since the outbreak of the European War, there have been two revisions one after another. The newly revised rates are twice as high as before the war. The following are the rates from Shanghai to various places (calculated per 100): Shanghai to the British Irish Free State or Continental Europe (excluding Germany and Italy and their territories) is 2.375 yuan, Shanghai to North American Atlantic ports via Suez (including Mediterranean surcharges) is 2.875 yuan, Shanghai to North American Atlantic ports via the Cape of Good Hope is 0.875 yuan, Shanghai to North American Atlantic ports via Panama is 0.675 yuan, Shanghai to Mediterranean ports (including surcharges) is 2.750 yuan, Shanghai to the Persian Gulf (newly set) is 0.5 yuan, Shanghai to East Africa and South Africa (newly set) is 0.665 yuan, Shanghai to the Black Sea (newly set, including surcharges) is 3.75 yuan. Because the surcharge for passing through the Mediterranean has increased from 1 yuan to 2 yuan, the rate from Shanghai to London via the Mediterranean has increased from 2 yuan, 3 jiao 7 fen 5 to 4 yuan, 3 jiao 7 fen 5. Other routes to the east and west coasts of South America via the Cape of Good Hope are 8 jiao 7 fen 5, to Australia 8 jiao 7 fen 5, to the Straits Settlements India East Africa 3 jiao 7 fen 5, and to other routes and various parts of the Chinese coast 2 jiao 5. There has been no increase in the rates to Australia and Chinese ports. However, these rates do not apply to Germany, Italy, and their territories.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the European War has naturally increased the danger of maritime transportation, and the increase in war insurance is a natural thing. However, the simultaneous soaring of various expenses such as freight and ship charter rates will naturally have a great impact on the shipping industry, and the result will be the recurrence of a world trade recession.</p>
<p>Decline of Shipping Industries of Various Countries in China</p>
<p>Finally, let us talk about the impact of the European War on the shipping industries of various countries in China. Since the major ports of China have been blockaded by the Japanese Navy, the business of European and American shipping companies has plummeted. Not only has North China's shipping industry been completely seized by Japanese ships, but even South and Central China have been severely hit by Japanese merchants; Among them, the United Kingdom has suffered the most. Before the war, there were four major British shipping companies operating in the Yangtze River: Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Xiangtai, and Asia, with a total tonnage of 65,700 tons; In terms of the number of ships, it also accounted for 39%, ranking first. Now, the first place has been exclusively occupied by Japanese merchants. As for coastal shipping, due to the blockade by the Japanese army, business is declining day by day, with little hope for the future. The British government has repeatedly protested to the Japanese government, but not only has it had no effect, but under the promotion of anti-British policies, the prospects of British shipping in China are on the verge of bankruptcy. Now that the United Kingdom is busy with affairs in Europe, the shipping industry in the Far East is even more affected. Now, most of the British ships originally sailing to the Far East have been transferred, so Japanese shipping has become more active.</p>
<p>The Beiyang shipping routes are divided into: Shanghai-Hai, Shanghai-Qing, Shanghai-Tianjin, Shanghai-Liaoning, Shanghai-Yingkou, Shanghai-An regions and Qing, Hai, Yantai, Longkou, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yingkou, Liaoning, An various sub regions. In the past, the ships operating on various routes included the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the private Zhengji, Northern, Zhidong, Zhaoxing, Datongxing, Yu Da companies, and foreign ships included the British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies. However, after the war, Chinese ships were subsequently forced to suspend operations, and British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships were repeatedly obstructed, and could only barely maintain the Shanghai-Qingdao-Yantai-Tianjin routes. Now, due to the European War, they have announced the suspension of operations. As for Japanese merchants, under the cooperation of the Japanese naval authorities, they have greatly expanded. In addition to Japanese shipping companies such as Nisshin, Dalian, Yamashita, Osaka, Near Seas, and International, who are trying their best to dominate North China's shipping, they have also acquired all the ships of the Zhengji company and leased various Chinese merchant ships, specializing in North China's shipping routes, so that the North China shipping routes have become the world of Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>The Nanyang shipping routes are divided into: Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Fuzhou, Shanghai-Xiamen, Shanghai-Shantou, Shanghai-Hong Kong, Shanghai-Guangzhou regions, as well as Inner Harbor Shanghai-Taiwan, Shanghai-Ruiping, Shanghai-Xingquan and Ningbo, Dinghai, Xiangshan, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Macau, Wuzhou various sub regions. Among them, except for the Inner Harbor routes operated by Chinese merchants, the Shanghai-Fuzhou, Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou routes have always been operated by British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships. However, later, the Japanese warships, on the pretext of military operations, attempted to blockade Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xinghua, Sandu Ao, Shacheng and other ports, and arbitrarily detained and inspected foreign ships along the coast, obstructing navigation, so that ships of various countries operating on these routes lost their freedom of navigation and their business declined sharply. Therefore, at present, it is the day when shipping industries of various countries with more than 80 years of history in China have encountered misfortune.</p>
<h3>Past Week</h3>
<p>In the past week, the phenomenon of rising prices for all goods has at least stopped; in the speculative market, there has generally been a state of decline in all goods. Comparing the market prices of last Saturday with those of the Saturday before: cash small six (a type of coin) was 60 yuan; twenty strands of Double Horse (a brand of yarn) spot goods were a little under 22 yuan; Tongzhou flower (a type of cotton) was a little under 11 yuan; the prices of various grades of rice were generally a little under 6 or 7 yuan to 12 or 13 yuan, varying. At this time, foreign exchange rates were steadily increasing, and the weakness at the weekend was only the result of struggles by major players. The results of the struggles were only this much, showing that the power of the bulls will always lose out to the improvement of objective circumstances! What are the improved objective circumstances? One is that the great victory in Changsha has strengthened the confidence of the Chinese people in final victory; the other is that the not-quite-dead, not-quite-alive war situation in Europe has greatly activated China's export industry. Therefore, the way to have a good life is not difficult, and the direction everyone should strive for is nothing more than this. (Editor)</p>
<p>If you want to "gain both fame and fortune," the opportunity is waiting for you at the small window of the post office. According to reports, more than 1,000 post offices across the country will be selling "National Construction Savings Bonds" starting from the end of November. Use your savings to buy these savings bonds, helping "national construction" now, and in the future, you will not only get back your principal but also earn interest income; wouldn't that be "gaining both fame and fortune" in one fell swoop? (Wang Siwei)</p>
<p>The wave of resignations of all internal and external officials in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, due to Abe's yielding to his subordinates, seems to have come to an end. If there are no other obstacles in the future, the Ministry of Trade will probably be able to open on an auspicious day. The purpose of establishing this ministry is nothing more than to use trade to assist diplomatic negotiations, and at the same time, attempt to achieve the desire to revitalize exports. However, it only has the export power of peaceful commodities, which is definitely not welcomed by various countries; the military supplies that various countries welcome to import are exactly what Japan cannot spare the effort to export. Therefore, it cannot exert any power in diplomacy with this, and even the hope of revitalizing exports is very small. Moreover, the prerequisite for revitalizing exports is to have sufficient raw materials. It only has one way, which is to take it from China. If it hadn't suffered a major defeat in northern Hunan, the tricks of "cooperation" and "control" in the occupied areas might have been very lively already. (Zhengze)</p>
<p>The reporter accurately predicted in the last issue of this publication that Vice Admiral of Shipbuilding Takao Utaro would not be able to stay in the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and would sooner or later hand it over to someone else. Unexpectedly, yesterday's Tokyo telegram already had news of Utaro's resignation. Abe's ideal of a centralized system has therefore been discounted again. I can't help but feel disheartened for Abe.

<h3>The First Half of the Year for China's Banking Industry</h3>
<p>— Yang Zheng</p>
<p>Changes in the establishment of banks: In the past six months, only two new banks have been established, the Xingwen Bank in Kunming and the Gansu Bank in Lanzhou. The former was reorganized from the Xingwen Official Bank and was established on May 1, with a capital of 600,000 New Yunnan currency funded by the Yunnan Provincial Department of Finance. According to the history of the Official Bank, it was initially named Xingwen and was established during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, operating two types of businesses: remittance and pawnbroking. After the Republic of China, it underwent several reforms. After the Department of Finance joined the government shares, it was changed to the Official Bank, with a total capital of 3 million Yunnan New currency. The scope of business was expanded compared to before, in addition to deposit, trust, and pawn businesses, it also acted as the treasury of the Department of Finance, funding for education, and military and political funds. The latter was reorganized from the Gansu Provincial Ping City Official Money Bureau under the order of the Ministry of Finance and opened on June 1.</p>
<p>The bank that closed down in the past six months was the Beiyang Baoshang Bank in Peiping, which announced liquidation on January 5. According to records, the bank was initiated by the Minister of Beiyang in the 34th year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty and was not established until the 2nd year of Xuantong. The initial authorized capital was 4 million taels, which was later changed to a limited company with a paid-up capital of 1,129,500 yuan. The head office was located in Peiping, and a branch was located in Tianjin. It issued banknotes, which amounted to 3 million yuan by the end of last year.</p>
<p>Mergers and additions: In the past six months, a total of six branches of banks have been merged, including four branches and two offices. In terms of region, five were in Shanghai and only one was in Yichang.</p>
<p>In the past six months, the establishment of branches of banks has mostly been in the southwestern provinces. This is a manifestation of the shift of China's financial center to the southwestern provinces; a list of branch additions in the past six months is as follows: Month Bank Name Region January</p>
<p>Business trends: The business trends of banks in the past six months have been carried out in accordance with China's wartime financial policy. For example, the central and special banks, in view of the importance of finance in the rear, through the resolution of the joint headquarters of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, laid out a financial network in the southwest and northwest provinces, which was carried out in four phases and was to be completed within this year. The four-bank discount committee has provided financial assistance to local industries, the salt industry, the metal industry, the electrical materials industry, the shipbuilding industry, and various manufacturers in various places, all of which are directly or indirectly related to military affairs. Furthermore, due to the bombing of various cities and the evacuation of the population, funds have been allocated to build houses in nearby villages, with an estimated cost of 10 million yuan. It is actively assisting the government in providing reconstruction loans after the bombing of various cities. In addition, the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the Bank of China handles remittances from overseas Chinese. The business trends of provincial and municipal banks, after the second local financial conference in March, resolved the following six items: (1) Develop economic strength (1) Maintain currency system credit, (3) Increase business, (4) Purchase materials, (5) Balance prices, (6) Meet the needs of food. The essence contained in each item is closely related to people's livelihood, national economy, and the foundation for economic revival. Provincial and municipal banks have been able to proceed in accordance with the resolutions, and there have been significant achievements.</p>

<h3>North-South Goods: Sichuan pickled mustard tuber is in short supply and prices rise</h3>
<p>Sichuan pickled mustard tuber, recently, there have been no subsequent arrivals, and the market inventory is dwindling. There are only a few hundred remaining, so although the sales season has passed, the selling price has instead increased. Yesterday, Fuling mustard tuber arrived at 82 yuan.

Therefore, transactions among colleagues have become sluggish, and the daily turnover is less than 100 tons, but the door shop still sells at the original price, because most of the street customers have stocked goods, the cost is higher, and they are unwilling to sell lightly. Screened blocks are 17 yuan per basket (100 city catties per load) and 6.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The United States uses more real silk</h3>

It is because the season has entered late autumn, and winter silk fabrics have been put on machines, and raw materials are mostly made of real silk. On the other hand, it is said that artificial silk factories have been affected by the European war, which has also made the sales of real silk smoother. According to the statistics, New York's raw silk imports in September were 39,569 loads, an increase of 7,162 loads, sales were 36,869 loads, an increase of 3,774 loads, and the bottom stock increased by 2,700 loads, but compared with the bottom stock in September of the previous year, it has decreased by a huge 12,951 loads.

<p>Sex Hygiene</p>
<h3>Hygiene of primary sexual characteristics and reproductive function</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>Regarding the differences between the sexes, on the surface, it seems very obvious and easy, but in fact, it is sometimes vague and difficult to distinguish. There are several kinds of animals whose sexual characteristics are only obvious during the mating season. Some birds and reptiles can only be determined by people with considerable knowledge and experience as female or male, which is impossible for ordinary people. Even in humans, sometimes the distinction between men and women is also difficult to determine, and it must be checked by experts or specialized doctors for a long time before a clear distinction can be made, because humans are also similar to animals, and there are people with both male and female characteristics (commonly known as hermaphrodites), but the quantity is less than that of animals. Usually, what is seen is mostly similar hermaphrodites, only their appearance has the characteristics of both male and female sexes; if they really have both sexes' reproduction, then they can be called true hermaphrodites, but the number is very small. Therefore, it is not enough to distinguish men and women by appearance alone. It is necessary to see whether there are ovaries or testicles to be the standard of distinction. If a person has testicles in his body, then this person is male, and similarly, a person has ovaries in his body, then this person is female. Therefore, the primary sexual characteristics are distinguished by the testicles and ovaries that are directly related to reproduction.</p>
<p>Generally, people have testicles or ovaries at birth, so the primary sexual characteristics are innate. The hygiene of both sexes' reproduction is closely related to the prosperity of mankind, so it is described separately as follows:</p>
<p>The hygiene of reproduction, in a word, is desire. Before marriage, it is best to remain chaste, have a clear mind and few desires, do not defile yourself and cause injury, so that the metabolism of the old and new declines, premature aging and kidney deficiency, the brain and kidney lose the guarantee of prosperity, and all kinds of diseases arise, such as spermatorrhea, neurasthenia, back pain, gradually forming. If you don't remedy it early, the consequences are worrying. I, as a doctor, prove that the treatment of this disease can only hope for rejuvenation by actively taking the old German brand testicle essence preparation for men, "Buti Kang". At the same time, it is advisable to avoid mistakenly purchasing similar counterfeit drugs, because although there are preparations with the same ingredients on the market that attract patients, most of them are aphrodisiacs in disguise, or tonics similar to aphrodisiacs. Only Buti Kang is a real male strong animal testicle essence tonic, and it has brain tonic phosphorus added. The female use has the function of regulating menstruation and seeds, treating anemia and premature aging, and the effect is quick.</p>
<p>Amazing Discovery Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Medical Doctor in America</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>There is already a specific medicine for gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Medical Doctor in America</p>
<p>I have been studying gonorrhea for more than ten years. When I was studying in the United States, I paid attention to the radical cure of this disease. I deeply know that gonococcus is a fast-breeding thing, absolutely inferior to general inferior bacteria, so it should be treated quickly, so as not to change, and in treatment, not only take a rapid treatment policy, but also must have solid conditions. Because blindly using powerful drugs to seek quick effects often leads to counterproductive results due to the powerful side effects. Therefore, special attention must be paid to this point.</p>
<p>After two weeks of gonorrhea infection, gonococcus has gonococcus flowing in the blood. Although only the symptoms of gonococcus are seen on the outside, various symptoms often occur. Therefore, it must be treated. According to the experience of scholars from various countries and mine, only increasing white blood cells and immune antitoxin therapy can kill bacteria with the strong force of blood cells, and as a result, gonococcus has nowhere to escape. Only "Kelin Nong" invented by Dr. Peter of Germany can often do this without shame. This agent is made of refined yellow pigment protein. All acute and chronic gonorrhea, plus prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, etc., can be taken, and "Kelin Nong" can be used to cure them radically. After taking this agent for the above-mentioned various gonorrhoea, it can produce non-specific anti-gonococcal toxin to attack gonococcus, so all gonococcus can be quickly cured and never recur. As for external medicine, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is the best. Patients can wash the urethra at home according to the diagram and instructions to clear the gonococcus in the urethra. Women can use "Kaerxuedishi vaginal tablets" as suppositories for external use, which will be more effective. Because only this kind of therapy can wipe out gonococcus like the wind sweeps away the residual leaves, which is not comparable to the general transmembrane sterilization therapy. This is why it has long been appreciated by doctors in various countries.</p>
<h3>Tuberculosis Treatment Examples</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Patient Feng Yongde is physically weak. At the age of twenty, he suffered from hemoptysis. He recovered after resting for several months. Later, due to excessive use of his brain, he relapsed last summer, with chest tightness and shortness of breath. Coughing up bloody sputum. He had a slight fever of 37.7 degrees at dusk, and his body became thinner and thinner, haggard and unbearable. He had difficulty falling asleep at night. He had many dreams and palpitations, and he also had night sweats, which caused dizziness and fatigue in the morning. After X-ray examination, there were silver-sized cavities in the lungs, and pulmonary tuberculosis had reached the third stage. He was instructed to take German "Bufei Naer" internally. After taking less than two bottles, the night sweats and fever were gone, and the condition improved greatly. So he continued to take it for three weeks, and at the same time ordered him to be absolutely quiet at home and take more nutrients: cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, etc. were completely cured, and his appetite increased greatly, and his weight increased. He has been transformed into a healthy and beautiful man.</p>
<p>Cured case of spermatorrhea</p>
<h3>Spermatorrhea and Brain Weakness</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Medical Doctor in Germany</p>
<p>Patient Chi Hongbin, a native of Danyang, 21 years old, lives in Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, this city (self-reported) —— I have been weak and sickly since I was a child. I came to Shanghai to work at the age of sixteen. I have no bad habits of masturbation, and I have no bad habits. Since the autumn of eighteen, I have had nocturnal emissions in my dreams every night, but I didn't take it seriously, because I was naive at that time, and I didn't realize the harm of spermatorrhea. On average, I had four nocturnal emissions every month, but on the morning after the nocturnal emissions, I felt mentally exhausted, had headaches and leg pain. At this time, I bought and took a certain malt extract cod liver oil, and it was ineffective after taking three bottles. After half a year, the number of nocturnal emissions gradually increased, and I often had dizziness, weak memory, and suffered from insomnia. Later, I was introduced by a friend to a certain Chinese medicine doctor for diagnosis and treatment. It was said that it was caused by excessive daytime labor. After taking two bottles of pills, it was also ineffective, and the symptoms worsened. I saw the newspaper report and came to seek treatment (cure process) —— I prescribed a large number of "Naires spermatorrhea tablets" to stop his spermatorrhea, and also used "Buti Kang" for men to treat neurasthenia and to replenish his losses. Mr. Chi followed the instructions and after three weeks, there was no spermatorrhea. He also slept peacefully at night. He was ordered to take it for another two months, his spirit was greatly invigorated, his mind was clear, and his weight increased by thirteen pounds. Spermatorrhea has been radically cured since then.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Lecture</p>
<h3>The Problem of Radical Cure of Recurrent Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is originally a very stubborn disease. If it is not properly treated when it is first contracted, and it becomes chronic, there is no determination to cure it, so the progress of the virus becomes more profound. Although it is lucky to recover for a while, there is often the risk of recurrence, because gonorrhea patients have very strong resistance when they are healthy - part of their resistance is caused by the occurrence of gonorrhea. However, if patients encounter other reasons, such as physical weakness, then the gonorrhea, which was regarded as healed, will take the opportunity to rise up and wreak havoc on people. The patient's pain at that time must be worse than before, and the changes in the disease are also more difficult to predict than before, because gonococcus has been suppressed for a long time. Although the appearance is safe and sound, its internal situation is because the gonococcus breeds and lurks, so once it is launched, it is like a flood, and it is difficult to contain it. Although the above is said, it is only that gonorrhea patients can temporarily recover because of their health and ability to follow health methods. What's more, because of the use of powerful drugs or clumsy surgery, they are temporarily subdued and then recur, which is even more severe than before. In short, if there are no symptoms of gonorrhea on the surface, but there is still gonococcus lurking in the body, it can never be regarded as a radical cure. In recent years, I have been confident in the treatment of this kind of recurrent gonorrhea. First, use serum testing to prove that there is gonorrhea toxin lurking, and then use German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy alternately, while taking the gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelin Nong" internally, so that its bactericidal effect will wash the whole body, then any gonococcus can never escape, so it can be completely and fundamentally solved. Therefore, once cured, there will be no recurrence. This is truly worthy of the gonorrhea method that fundamentally solves gonorrhea. Diagnosis time: 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. 20 numbers are sent for diagnosis every day, and only 5 jiao is charged for each number, and a "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth 1 yuan is given as a gift.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Consular Corps Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss Problems in Western Shanghai, and Decide on a Negotiation Policy After the British and American Attitudes Are Firm and Will Never Concede</h3>
<p>Regarding the negotiations on the construction of roads beyond the boundary, Mr. Phillips, Director-General of the Public Works Department, exchanged views with the pseudo "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan twice in June and early September of this year, hoping to find a solution. However, the pseudo-party's actions have become more and more intensified, having already infringed on police power and attempted to seize taxes worth more than one million yuan per year. The Japanese-proposed plan to adjust the defense area also requires the withdrawal of British defense forces from the road construction area beyond the boundary. Recently, after thorough discussions by the parties concerned, they have all adopted a firm attitude, believing that except for negotiations with the Chinese government that are related to territorial sovereignty, other methods seem to be unable to obtain a thorough solution. Therefore, it is quite advocated to temporarily put aside the negotiations on road construction beyond the boundary and the defense area issue. The United Kingdom and the United States have significant rights and interests in its public concessions and will never easily concede. Although the United Kingdom is currently having affairs in Europe, the United States cannot ignore it. Yesterday, a reporter from the Dachung News Agency obtained another reliable news in diplomatic circles, hearing that the Consular Corps has decided to convene a meeting within this week, at most five days, to discuss the issue of road construction beyond the boundary in western Shanghai, to exchange opinions on the report of the authorities and the views of the British and American sides, and to determine the Public Works Department's future negotiation policy with the pseudo-party.</p>
<p>Unarmed pseudo police were blocked twice</p>
<p>The Chinese-Foreign Newspaper (字林報) reports that 160 to 180 unarmed policemen from the "Special Municipal Government," traveling in four trucks, were blocked twice yesterday (the 14th) from entering the British defense area. The matter was peacefully resolved by British Major Ashmore and the Japanese advisor to the "Special Municipal Government," Katie Uka (transliteration), and an official Wang (transliteration) from the "Municipal Government." The four trucks eventually carried the police towards the Hongqiao area. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Four trucks</p>
<p>Arrived at the railway crossing of Baillinan Road at nearly 5 pm, attempting to enter the Public Concession. However, the British soldiers stationed there immediately blocked the road, and the trucks could not pass and turned to the Daxilu crossing, where they were also blocked by the British soldiers and could not pass. Major Ashmore</p>
<p>Reported immediately</p>
<p>Arrived at the scene a few minutes later. Around 7 pm, the Japanese advisor and Mr. Wang also arrived. Major Ashmore explained to the two that those who passed in groups would not be allowed to pass without the permission of the British military authorities. It is heard that Major Ashmore also told the two that it had been repeatedly explained that those who intended to cross the border in groups must obtain permission. The nature of the conversation at the time was extremely friendly. The Japanese advisor then ordered the trucks to return to the defense area. The general public does not pay much attention to this matter.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Major to Work in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Traveling with Chinese staff to serve in the Southwest</p>
<p>The Continental Daily (大陸報) reported yesterday (the 14th) that the Salvation Army Headquarters announced that Major Baglai of the Army and four trained Chinese staff will depart for Chongqing on Tuesday. The work of the Salvation Army will be expanded to southwestern China. Major Bei has been the second in command of the Salvation Army in the Shanghai area for the past two years, proving that his previous experience in social work in India and North China has special value. Major Bei took office as an officer in 1919 and was sent to China in 1921. For the past 18 years, he has held a very responsible position in this charity and has traveled all over China. This decision was made in response to the call of friends who said that Chongqing urgently needs the services of the Salvation Army, and he is currently establishing a new agency in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Stalled Settlement of Local Goods Exchange, Shortened Shanghai-Ningbo Voyage Schedule</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route is currently stalled due to the requirement for foreign exchange settlement for Ningbo's exported local products. Although various industries in Shanghai and Ningbo have sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance requesting flexibility, the export of local Ningbo goods to Shanghai remains suspended until instructions are received. However, as ships are only carrying passengers, round trips are shorter. It is reported that the Far East Company's "Hana Maru" departed for Zhenhai yesterday, and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Mowatt" is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Zhenhai on the 17th, carrying only passengers, with cargo loading temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Departs Shanghai for the Philippines This Morning; U.S. Consul General Gauss Feted Him Last Night, with Admiral Hepburn Also in Attendance</h3>
<p>The newly appointed U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, arrived in Shanghai at 2:45 p.m. yesterday aboard the Dollar Steamship Lines' "President Cleveland." Various American organizations in Shanghai and U.S. Consul General Gauss, among others, went to the Jianghai Customs pier to welcome him. At 6 p.m. yesterday, the U.S. Consul General hosted a banquet at Xiejiao, Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>Admiral Hepburn,</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, was also in attendance. The atmosphere was very cordial. Gauss delivered a welcome speech, and Sayre gave a brief thank-you speech. Sayre is scheduled to take office on the 19th and did not want to stay in Shanghai any longer. He departed Shanghai this morning on the same ship for Hong Kong and the Philippines to assume his post.</p>
<p>The previous</p>
<p>High Commissioner</p>
<p>to the Philippines, Mr. McNutt, returned to Washington this spring. The Washington government then internally decided that Sayre would succeed him. Also arriving in Shanghai on the "President Cleveland" was</p>
<p>Mr. Douglas,</p>
<p>who will take up the post of Captain of the Yangtze River Fleet. Mr. Douglas recently completed a trip to his native Finland. He went to the United States after the outbreak of the European War. During his short stay in the U.S., he once gave a radio address to America about the world war. He then took the "President Cleveland" from San Francisco to Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the American community in Shanghai eagerly welcomed Mr. and Mrs. Sayre, the newly appointed U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, and their staff, who arrived aboard the "President Cleveland" scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 1:45 p.m. today (the 15th), and will depart on the same ship</p>
<p>for Manila</p>
<p>to take up their new posts tomorrow morning (the 16th) at 10:00 a.m. It is expected that after the "President Cleveland" docks, Mr. and Mrs. Sayre will disembark on Admiral Hepburn's private yacht. According to the plan, Admiral Hepburn, U.S. Consul General Gauss, and several members of the American community will board the "President Cleveland" on a U.S. Navy motorboat to meet Mr. Sayre. Gauss stated that due to the limited time the ship is docked in Shanghai, the American community will not hold a</p>
<p>formal reception.</p>
<p>However, from 5 to 6 p.m. today, a banquet will be held at the Columbia Country Club to give the American community an opportunity to meet Mr. and Mrs. Sayre. It is noted that U.S. President Roosevelt appointed Sayre as the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines on July 27, succeeding McNutt.</p>
<h3>Transportation Bank's Withdrawn Branches Resume Business Today; Payments Made Through Rear Door, Employee Examinations to Continue</h3>
<p>After the former site of the head office of the Bank of Communications at 10 Hankou Road was forcibly requisitioned by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, the branches that had withdrawn are waiting for a reasonable resolution from the concession authorities. The withdrawn branches are scheduled to resume business at their original locations this morning. All documents from the tutoring classes have been moved out, and the employee recruitment examinations will continue after a suitable location is found. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resuming Operations at the Original Location Today</p>
<p>The temporary liaison offices of the Bank of Communications' Zhejiang Area, Shanghai Area, and Zhenjiang Area branches, which were forced to temporarily cease operations on the 13th, have not only telegraphed the head office for instructions but have also convened a meeting of the withdrawn branches by the Shanghai branch. It has been decided to resume payments at the original locations starting today (Monday). Those who wish to withdraw funds from the various withdrawn branches should enter and exit through the rear door of the bank on Hankou Road. At the same time, employees of the withdrawn branches have been sorting everything out since the morning before yesterday. The doormen and patrolmen hired by the bank have also resumed their duties.</p>
<p>Documents and Examination Questions Moved Out Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the Japanese Military Police Headquarters forcibly requisitioned the third and fourth floors of the building, the concession authorities are responsible for negotiations. The Shanghai Municipal Council is submitting this matter to the board of directors for discussion, but no decision has yet been made. However, the Bank of Communications is waiting for a legal resolution from the concession authorities. As for the tutoring class's documents, equipment, and examination questions used for the recruitment examination, they were completely moved out yesterday. Therefore, the bank will continue to conduct the examinations after a suitable location is found. However, the employee tutoring class has been forced to temporarily suspend classes due to the occupation of its location.</p>
<p>Employee Examinations to Continue</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited the bank on the Bund of Hankou Road yesterday. The reporter noted that the rooms requisitioned by the Japanese soldiers are the entire third and fourth floors, while the ground floor and second floor are used for the offices of the withdrawn branches. The third and fourth floors are separated from the ground floor and second floor, and the Japanese soldiers enter and exit through the main entrance at 10 Hankou Road. Therefore, the operations of the withdrawn branches are not affected in any way. Furthermore, the reporter met with a deputy manager of the bank yesterday, who confirmed that the withdrawn branches are scheduled to resume business at the original location today, and the documents of the tutoring class have indeed been moved out as stated. The recruitment examination will continue after a suitable location is found.</p>
<p>British Troops Visited for Inspection</p>
<p>The location of the Bank of Communications is purely within the defense zone of British troops. The Japanese side's sudden action not only undermines the concession's police authority but also directly threatens the British troops. The British military authorities in Shanghai, upon learning of this news, dispatched a small team of over thirty Central British soldiers, fully armed, to inspect the Hankou Road area yesterday morning around 9:00 a.m. They withdrew around 10:00 a.m. It is reported that after the British troops inspected, they will report the information to the highest British military authority in China for instructions on how to respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Reports Rental Nature</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported yesterday (the 14th) that twenty Japanese in plain clothes forcibly occupied the third and fourth floors of the former Bank of Communications building on the Bund of Hankou Road on Friday morning. At that time, the Shanghai Municipal Police planned to ask the British troops patrolling the area for assistance in expelling the invading Japanese. It was later learned that in the past few days, a Japanese person had visited the building with a bank employee. The police were unaware of any relationship between the bank and the Japanese side, so they had to postpone taking action pending further developments. The North-China Daily News reported yesterday that the Japanese side had proposed renting a portion of the building to use as a dormitory, paying a monthly rent of several thousand yuan, said to be three thousand yuan, at least according to what the employees knew.</p>
<h3>Unabated Street Flooding, High Tide Persists for Three More Days, Low-Lying Areas Still Ankle-Deep Last Night, Central District Particularly High and Relatively Dry</h3>
<p>The high tide in the Huangpu River that began on the 13th will continue until the 20th before it subsides. During the high tide, water inevitably overflows from the low-lying roads and sewers. The tide times and levels for today (the 16th) to the 19th are recorded below: On the 16th, the high tide at 1:44 a.m. was 10 feet, 7.5 inches; the high tide at 2:10 p.m. was 11 feet, 2.8 inches; on the 17th, the high tide at 2:20 a.m. was 9 feet, 5.3 inches; the high tide at 5:52 p.m. was 10 feet, 8.2 inches; on the 18th, the high tide at 2:55 a.m. was 8 feet, 9.2 inches; the high tide at 3:40 p.m. was 10 feet, 0.5 inches.</p>
<p>Street Flooding Has Not Yet Subsided</p>
<p>After the heavy rain yesterday morning in the city, the high tide in the Huangpu River continued yesterday afternoon, causing the street flooding to recede very slowly and not yet completely subside. According to surveys, areas such as the intersection of Qihaiwei Road and Ma Huo Road, Alabastine Road, Gansu Road, Jiaozhou Road, Saposai Road, north of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre, Route Cardinal Mercier, mid-section of Route Paul Henry, Rue Massenet, Avenue Foch, and Route Haig are still flooded.</p>
<p>High Tide Continued Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>According to the predictions of the</p>
<p>Harbour Bureau, the Huangpu River continued to experience a high tide at 1:35 p.m. yesterday, with a level of 11 feet. Therefore, water overflowed from the street sewers again, and low-lying roads were once again flooded. Regarding transportation, everything had returned to normal yesterday, but public buses, such as those on route 22 in the French Concession, still had to detour via Avenue Foch and still had to wade through water until late at night. The sky was overcast all day yesterday, and the weather was not yet formally [clear].</p>
<h3>Eyewitness Account of Chinese Air Force Attack on Hankou</h3>
<p>36 Japanese Planes Completely Destroyed, Pilots Also Killed in the Planes</p>
<p>Chinese Cheer and Applaud</p>
<p>The Japanese ship "Hoyo Maru" arrived in Shanghai from Hankou the day before yesterday. According to a Chinese passenger who took the return trip to Shanghai, at approximately 1:00 p.m. on the 3rd of this month, just as the "Hoyo Maru" arrived in Hankou from Shanghai and was about to dock, the brave Chinese Air Force</p>
<p>appeared over Hankou.</p>
<p>According to the eyewitness, there were six large bombers flying at a low altitude, with over thirty fighter planes guarding and covering them at a high altitude. The bombers then fiercely dropped bombs amidst the Japanese anti-aircraft fire, with the bombs</p>
<p>raining down like trash.</p>
<p>The explosions were deafening. There were thirty-six Japanese planes at the airfield, with pilots already in the cockpits, preparing to take off to intercept. Due to the lack of time, the planes were completely destroyed and burned, and over thirty pilots</p>
<p>were killed in the planes.</p>
<p>The burning lasted for over an hour. When the Chinese planes were bombing, no Japanese planes were seen taking off to resist. However, the Chinese gathered in the French Concession cheered and applauded. The Japanese military police stood outside the concession, helpless.</p>
<h3>Railway Traffic Conditions from Rangoon to Lashio; Yunnan-Burma Road Temporarily Open to Baoshan, Connection to Burmese Railway Awaits</h3>
<p>Since our country's Yunnan-Burma Road began military traffic, British Burma has become an important gateway for the import and export of materials in the southwest. Currently, the Yunnan-Burma Road can only reach Baoshan. The direct connection to the Burmese railway from Lashio to Rangoon, for direct intermodal transport, is still pending. However, the importance of this road is not diminished by the fact that it has not yet been connected. The current status of railway traffic between Rangoon and Lashio is described in detail as follows: The Rangoon to Lashio railway is 903 kilometers long, with a travel time of 28 hours. Freight express can arrive in three days. From Rangoon to Toungoo (267 kilometers), it is double-tracked. From Toungoo to Mandalay (53 kilometers), Mandalay to Hsipaw (199 kilometers), and Hsipaw to Lashio (84 kilometers), all are single-tracked. The main passenger train on the Rangoon to Mandalay line has a mixed train running daily in both directions. It arrives in Lashio at night and departs from Lashio in the morning. The first, second, and third class carriages are available, but there are no fourth-class seats. In addition to the stations, ticket sales points are set up in many downtown areas of major cities to sell tickets for each section and accept parcels. Rangoon and other stations also have railway reception centers, which are exclusively for first-class passengers to rest. The room rates are relatively high, and the maximum stay is no more than five days. As for the dining rooms along the route, although many are set up, they are only for first and second-class passengers to eat. The prices are fixed, and meal tickets must be purchased in advance.</p>
<h3>Exemption from Exchange Settlement for Zhejiang Province Native Paper Requested</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Measures for Exchange Settlement and Collection of Exchange Rate Differences for Export Goods, trade associations in Shanghai have called for relief. As a result, goods transported from Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places to Shanghai have been forced to be blocked at ports such as Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, after receiving requests from various trade associations, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs requesting swift relief to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It again telegraphed the ministries yesterday, stating that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing are aware that the Zhejiang Customs has refused to allow the export of native paper because it has not settled foreign exchange, and the source of supply is about to be cut off. Native goods are made by hand using local raw materials, and sales are already minimal. Now, they are also required to settle foreign exchange, which will not only cause foreign paper to be dumped, but also harm the collectors, transporters, and local farmers. The public sentiment is urgent, and it is requested that relief be granted immediately. It is appropriate to telegraph the ministries to request that they consult the Zhejiang Provincial Government and order the Zhejiang Customs to exempt native paper from exchange settlement and allow its transport. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Small Denomination Notes Restricted Due to Crowding; Large Quantities of Small Denomination Notes Recently Shipped from Hong Kong; United Association of Special District Urges Recall of Tokens</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank has already limited the exchange of subsidiary coins to 20 yuan per business. The issuance of 10-cent and 20-cent subsidiary notes has not been restricted in terms of the amount of exchange. However, due to the crowding of those applying for exchange, the number of notes exchanged exceeds the previous number. Deeply fearing that large sums will flow into the occupied areas, the bank will, from today, also impose appropriate restrictions on large-scale exchanges. It is also heard that a large number of subsidiary notes have recently been shipped from Hong Kong, all printed by the China Book Company. Furthermore, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association is extremely concerned about the difficulty of the shortage of small denomination coins in the city. Because the streetcar company, the bus company, and various industry coupons have not been recalled immediately after the Central Bank issued subsidiary coins, the circulation of subsidiary coins has been hindered. The standing committee members of the association convened a special meeting yesterday and decided: (1) To send letters to the streetcar company and bus company in the two concessions requesting them to recall all temporary small denomination coupons they issued before October 31; (2) To request all companies and firms to recall the coupons they issued before October 31; (3) To persuade citizens not to hoard subsidiary coins in order to facilitate circulation; (4) To send a letter to the Tobacco Exchange Association to inform its members to exchange subsidiary coins as much as possible; (5) To send a letter to the Central Bank requesting it to issue the second batch of subsidiary coins as soon as possible and facilitate businesses' applications for exchange.</p>

<h3>Proposed Amicable Settlement After the Collapse of the Tonghe Bank; The Process Was Conducted at the Bankers' Association Yesterday; Settlement Would Be Discussed After Auditors Such as Dong Yu and Others Checked the Accounts</h3>
<p>The Tonghe Commercial Savings Bank in the city collapsed over a year ago, owing depositors hundreds of thousands of yuan. The bank authorities applied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for an amicable settlement in accordance with the bankruptcy law. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has twice convened meetings of debtors and creditors to discuss settlement methods, but no resolution has yet been reached. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has drafted a settlement plan for the incident: (1) 50% of savings deposits will be repaid, and the remaining 50% will be issued as shares of the bank. Directors and supervisors will advance 10% of the cash first, and receipts for 50% of the stock funds will be issued at the same time. It will be deposited with the Central Bank to guarantee that when it is ready to be collected, another 40% will be issued immediately; (2) It is estimated that 50% of commercial deposits can be repaid. The remaining 50% will be issued as shares of the bank when it is restored to business after the amicable settlement. There are three methods: First, it is estimated that one-third of the three million yuan in mortgage loans of the bank, or one million yuan, can be recovered; second, it is estimated that two-tenths of the 780,000 yuan in credit loans and 50,000 yuan in collection receivables, or more than 160,000 yuan, have a chance of being recovered. If the restoration of business and the amicable settlement are successful, the commercial depositors will first withdraw 100,000 yuan from the bank's fundraising to repay 10% of the deposits. Afterwards, the called-in amounts shall be repaid in batches. The remainder will be issued as shares of the bank when it is restored to business. The creditors of the savings department have accepted the settlement plan, but the creditors of the commercial department are still unanimously opposed. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of debtors and creditors at the Bankers' Association yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. to conduct the amicable settlement. 70 creditor representatives attended, representing a claim amount of more than 500,000, which was legally insufficient. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce representatives Pei Yunqing and Xi Yushu announced that the meeting would be changed to a discussion meeting. Then, representatives of both the debtor and creditor parties spoke in succession. The creditor Wang Licai first thought that he was a representative to check the accounts. After Dong Yu and other lawyers described the process of recommending representatives to check the accounts, Wang was speechless. Finally, Xi Yushu concluded that after Wang Licai, Wang Hongji, and Dong Yu and other representatives checked the accounts, they would talk again. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Withdraws Consulates; Japan Has Not Received Explanation; Believes This Move Has Some Significance But Has Not Received Formal Explanation From Soviet Side</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that when the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy greeted the press yesterday (the 13th), he claimed that the Japanese authorities had not received a formal explanation regarding the transfer of the Soviet consulates in the Japanese-occupied areas of China to the Norwegian consulates. For this move by the Soviet side, various reasons can be "inferred," but even if any of the reasons are correct, he should not disclose them. Eleven Soviet consulate officials have been recalled, leaving two or three people to take care of the consulate buildings. Due to the position of these two or three people, they cannot handle consulate affairs. If the spokesperson was asked whether he believed that the recall of Soviet consulate officials was purely a local matter or had a wider significance, the spokesperson replied that the public had expressed various opinions on this measure by the Soviet side, but this matter certainly had some significance. The Japanese side has not received a formal explanation from the Soviet side. The spokesperson also admitted that he did not know that several Soviet consulates in the Japanese-controlled areas had been transferred to the care of the Norwegian diplomatic authorities.</p>
<h3>The Adventures of the Two German Ships; Avoiding Interception by British Warships, Enduring Hardships, Passengers Left Their Fate to Heaven and Were Glad to Be Alive</h3>
<p>The North German Lloyd's "Scharhörn" and "Cremon" passenger ships were well-known to the people here. At the beginning of the European War, the two ships happened to be sailing in the waters of the East, and their whereabouts suddenly became mysterious. All circles were also very concerned. It was later learned that the two ships detoured to avoid interception by British warships and escaped to the coast of Japan to dock, and they were gradually</p>
<p>faded from memory.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency met a Westerner in Shanghai yesterday who had arrived from Japan. According to him, his relatives and friends who were passengers on the "Scharhörn" and "Cremon" personally experienced the dangerous situation. The frightening story is as follows: The "Cremon" left Singapore on August 25 with passengers bound for Manila. That evening, all passengers were summoned to the deck. The captain arrived shortly and delivered a speech. He first said that the ship had been requisitioned by the German Navy, so it was no longer the "Cremon."</p>
<p>Female passengers</p>
<p>Hearing the news, they burst into tears. The captain continued, saying that the ship would no longer sail to Manila, but would go to an unknown location. At this point, the passengers could only console themselves by leaving their fate to heaven. From then on, the "Cremon" sailed in the Pacific Ocean, meandering around. The smokestacks and ship name were painted over. After sailing for more than 20 days, it finally arrived at</p>
<p>Kobe, Japan</p>
<p>and docked. The passengers' adventurous journey came to an end. Normally, the ship would take only five days to sail from Singapore to Manila, but this time the passengers spent more than twenty days and were sent to Kobe, which they did not want to go to. They had to buy another boat to go to the Philippines. The visitor then mentioned the "Scharhörn", saying that on the</p>
<p>eve of the outbreak of the war,</p>
<p>it happened to be leaving the port of Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. The captain received a radio order to rush to Japan and warned that there were two British warships waiting outside the waters of Batavia, preparing to capture the ship. Therefore, it sailed at super speed, rushing to Kobe. It was not discovered by British warships along the way. However, the ship's speed exceeded its capabilities, and the passengers were uneasy. Fortunately, it was spared an accident and arrived safely at the port. Only then could they sleep peacefully.</p>
<h3>Commercial Registration Approved in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently approved the temporary registration of commercial enterprises in the city, including Yihua Industrial Cooperative, Binsheng Silver Shop, Continental Screw Factory, China Button Factory, and twelve others. Their business scope, capital amount, name and address of the principal or partners, and the number of registration notices have all been published in the Commercial Monthly, Volume 19, Number 9, in accordance with the Ministry's order.</p>
<h3>Increased Mooring Fees for Ships Berthing at Buoys; Fees Doubled Starting from the 26th, Calculated per 24 Hours</h3>
<p>Starting from the 26th of this month, the Jianghai Customs will increase the mooring fees for ships berthing at buoys in various sections of the Huangpu River. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Measures for Collecting Fees for Ship Berthing</p>
<p>The buoys set up by the Inland Customs in various sections of the Huangpu River are for the needs of various ships berthing. The mooring fees are based on the length of the ship. Longer ships must occupy two buoys at both ends (i.e., Type A), and smaller ships only need one buoy (i.e., Type C). Regarding the ship's berthing time, it is calculated per 24 hours. If it is less than 24 hours, the fee is still charged for one day.</p>
<p>Types A and C Doubled</p>
<p>Currently, the mooring fee is 30 yuan in national currency per 24 hours for Type A and 15 yuan for Type C. According to news from the Jianghai Customs yesterday, the Customs Harbour Affairs Department said that the cost of labor and metal products has increased significantly, resulting in a sharp increase in the cost of repairing buoys, cables, and machinery. The original fee is not enough to compensate. Therefore, it has been decided to double the original fee starting from the 26th of this month, that is, 60 yuan for Type A, which was originally 30 yuan, and 30 yuan for Type C, which was originally 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Train Derailment in Linping, Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Casualties; Japanese Train Hits Landmine and Explodes, More Than 300 Officers and Soldiers All Annihilated</h3>
<p>Jinhua, 15th telegram. The Chinese army in western Zhejiang buried landmines near Xitang Village, between Linping and Chang'an on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road on the evening of the 6th. A Japanese train with four attached flower cars left Hangzhou North. It hit a mine and exploded when it arrived there on the morning of the 7th. The train head was torn to shreds, and the train cars immediately overturned. More than 100 meters of railway track and 60 to 70 meters of roadbed were also destroyed. The Chinese ambushing troops took the opportunity to attack fiercely, throwing hand grenades into the train cars, killing nearly 100 senior Japanese military officers, including Kondo Yoshiyuki and Masuda Kiyoshi, and more than 200 soldiers and military police escorting the train, all of whom were annihilated. The Chinese army seized a large number of weapons, ammunition, and documents. Later, the escorting train rushed to the scene, and the Chinese army safely transferred.</p>
<p>Japanese Increase Defense of Bridges on Shanghai-Hangzhou Road</p>
<p>Due to the active mobile units of the Chinese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line, the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places specially dispatched Japanese and puppet troops from Shanghai by truck to reinforce the defenses along the railway yesterday morning. In addition to reinforcing the defenses at each bridge along the railway, a reconnaissance plane from Wusong Airport flew low along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line for reconnaissance at around 7:00 a.m. yesterday. In the afternoon, another three Japanese planes flew along the railway and highway for reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Fourth Peace Preservation Army Heavily Suppressed</p>
<p>Gao Fenggui, who was a mid-level officer in the warlord era, organized the puppet "Peace Preservation Army" in the western district of Shanghai and set up agencies all over the suburbs. It was surrounded and suppressed by the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army in the southern and western districts of Shanghai the day before yesterday, suffering heavy losses. It has retreated into the Japanese military cordon.</p>
<p>Heavy Sacrifices in the Battle of Zhabei Port</p>
<p>Hu, the captain of the Zhongdui of Ding Xishan's Pudong Guerrilla Force, recently led his troops to recover the area south of Zhabei Port, completely resolving the puppet army there and executing the puppet "Maintenance Association Chairman" and others, and hoisting the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. However, it was secretly reported by spies, and the Japanese army mobilized more than 300 naval and ground troops on the third day to surround and attack. The Zhongdui captain's troops were only less than 50 people, fighting alone for two hours before breaking through to the south. More than 20 people were gloriously sacrificed, and the Zhongdui captain was also killed in action. The remaining troops retreated to the headquarters to gather. Now, Ding has consulted with his friendly troops, Gu Shouxin, the detachment leader of the old unit of Yu Taosheng, to unite, so he is actively mobilizing troops to launch a major counterattack. Therefore, the Japanese army has opened up two warships in Zhabei Port and the Pudong area, totaling six ships in the Southern Huangpu area in the Xingtang Estuary of Minhang Dujia. In the warships in Zhabei Port, sentry posts are raised every day, and Japanese naval officers observe the movements of the guerrilla areas with binoculars on the top of the building. At night, they are supplemented with searchlights.</p>
<p>Ding and Fan Are Safe, Ding's Mother Was Murdered</p>
<p>The She Wen News Agency reported that there was a rumor in the city a few days ago that Ding Xishan, commander of the 8th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, and Fan Gencai, the brigade commander, were killed. According to reliable sources, Ding and Fan are both safe. However, Ding Xishan's mother came to Shanghai from her hometown last month, and she was indeed captured and murdered on the way.</p>

<h3>Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers on Active Duty; Grain Loans Allowed Exemption From Repayment</h3>
<p>To provide preferential treatment to families of soldiers on active duty, the Chinese military authorities have stipulated that families of soldiers on active duty who have borrowed grain from storage are allowed exemption from repayment. An order has already been issued to all provinces to comply.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sales and Lack of Raw Materials Lead to Many Rubber Factories Shutting Down</h3>
<p>Due to sluggish export sales of domestic rubber manufacturing factories in this city after the war, only about a dozen factories were operating. Since the outbreak of the European war, the price of rubber raw materials has soared many times over, and recently, the Malay Peninsula has banned the export of rubber, further exacerbating the difficulties. As a result, up to five-tenths of the factories have voluntarily suspended operations, and the remaining one-fifth have also uniformly reduced working hours to get through this period.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Medical Community Rushes to Rear Hospitals; Giving Up Practices to Serve the Country</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, various medical groups in this city actively organized rescue committees, dispatching personnel to the combat zones to rescue wounded soldiers, achieving remarkable results. As the Chinese army moved westward, the battle lines gradually traversed the entire country. These wounded soldiers' hospitals were relocated to the rear in advance to continue providing services. However, there are many newly established hospitals in the rear, and there is a great need for medical talent. The Military Affairs Commission has repeatedly advised doctors in various places to serve the country immediately. Upon hearing the news, many doctors in Shanghai promptly went to the interior to serve. A reporter from Daguan News Agency learned from medical groups that Yan Fuqing, Pang Jingzhou, Zhu Shenbi, and others from the Rescue Committee, after observing rescue work on the front lines, believed that the intense military resistance required a great need for rescue talent. They sent letters to various medical groups in this city, selecting experienced personnel to work in the interior. In recent days, many doctors have voluntarily given up their practices and gone to hospitals in the rear to serve. Their ardent patriotism is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Orphanage Seeks Winter Clothing and Supplies; Letters Sent to Public Organizations to Promote Donations; Appealing to All Sectors to Actively Donate Items</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Children's Home, established in September of last year, has reached its first anniversary. It initially housed 27 orphans, but the number has gradually increased. The Le Shan Temple site on Xiafei Road was no longer sufficient, so 28 new buildings were constructed in Lane 258, west of Maithesi Road on Wuding Road. These were completed last month, and the orphans were moved into the new buildings. The number of orphans cared for has increased to 507. As the number of orphans has suddenly increased, and in a blink of an eye, autumn is passing and winter is coming, the winter clothing and necessary supplies for the orphans are mostly lacking. It is reported that the orphanage sent letters to various public organizations in this city yesterday to seek support and promote donations. It has also drafted donation standards, appealing to all sectors to actively donate items. The donation standards are as follows: 1. 500 cotton quilts, priced at 6 yuan per quilt (for use as blankets). 2. 250 quilt batting, at 4 yuan per quilt (for use as mattresses). 3. 300 bedsheets, at 2 yuan each. 4. 500 lined uniforms (gray twill fabric, including labor cost 2.5 yuan per set). 5. 500 cotton uniforms (gray twill fabric, including labor cost 5 yuan per set). 6. 500 cotton overcoats (black Shilin fabric, including labor cost 3.5 yuan per coat). 7. 1,000 sets of undershirts and pants (2 yuan per set). 8. 1,000 undershirts (1 yuan each). 9. 100 dozens of towels (1.5 yuan per dozen). 10. 500 toothbrushes. 11. 100 dozens of socks. 12.

<h3>National Tea Sales Method; Agreed Upon Methods to Be Implemented Jointly</h3>
<p>Regarding the issues of national tea procurement and sales, outsiders often do not understand the true situation. Excerpts from the outline of the national tea methods jointly formulated by the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance and the China Tea Company of the Ministry of Economic Affairs are as follows: (1) The China Tea Company handles matters related to tea improvement, production, procurement, transportation, and domestic sales under the supervision of the Trade Commission. (2) All teas that meet the requirements for export, except for those contracted by the China Tea Company and China Trust Bureau this year, will be handled separately. The China Tea Company should, according to the conditions of the Trade Commission, be entrusted by the Trade Commission to purchase all of them and hand them over to the Trade Commission for external barter and external sales. (3) The China Tea Company collects export teas on behalf of the Trade Commission. The main points of the method are as follows: A) All teas suitable for export shall be graded by the Trade Commission together with the provincial governments, tea management offices, provincial tea industry guilds, and the China Tea Company. Each year, outside of tea making, the Trade Commission shall, based on the facts and with reference to the opinions of all parties, announce the prices according to the grades. During the purchase, the grading committee shall be organized by the Trade Commission together with the provincial governments and the China Tea Company to assess the grades and pay according to the announced prices. B) The delivery location of the goods collected by the China Tea Company shall be agreed upon by the Trade Commission and the China Tea Company. The transportation, storage, safekeeping, and insurance costs from the receiving point to the delivery point shall be paid by the Trade Commission based on the facts. C) The Trade Commission shall give the China Tea Company a commission of 3% for the tea purchased, in principle, but it should be stipulated in the formal contract based on the actual expenses of the company and considerable benefits. (Rest omitted).</p>
<h3>A Ship That Had Just Been Repaired Suddenly Sank; Those Arrested Have Not Yet Been Released</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochang Temple, Nanshi, was occupied by the Japanese and then taken over and operated by the Japanese company Mitsubishi. It specialized in repairing Japanese warships and ships. In the middle of last month, a Chinese ship salvaged from the Yangtze River was towed to the shipyard by the Japanese. After four months of repairs, it was completed and launched into the water, mooring in the river center. Just as it was about to be tested and put into use, around 11 p.m. on the night of the launching, several holes suddenly appeared in the bottom of the ship, and water poured in. By the time it was discovered, it was impossible to save it. The ship sank to the bottom of the river in less than an hour. The next day, the Japanese army was greatly alarmed, believing that the sabotage was carried out by Chinese patriots disguised as workers in the shipyard. A large-scale investigation was launched, and more than 100 coppersmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, and workers were arrested and detained, subjected to brutal torture and interrogation. After finding that they were not suspects, several batches were released. Now, a month has passed, and the ship has been salvaged again by the Japanese. It is covered in mud, and all the machinery is destroyed. It will take several months to repair it, and the estimated loss is at least 230,000 yuan. However, 17 coppersmiths who were arrested have not yet been released, and their fate is uncertain. Although their families have tried to rescue them, there has been no news. It is widely rumored that they have been secretly executed.</p>
<h3>Inquiry Regarding the Prohibition of Native Cloth Sales in Fujian</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that the Native Cloth Association had reported news that the Fujian Provincial Government had prohibited the transportation of native cloth to Fujian. A special telegram was sent to the Fujian Provincial Government and the Fuzhou County General Chamber of Commerce, Silk and Cloth Trade Association to inquire.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Authorities Do Not Interact With Germans; No Construction or Business Licenses Are Issued; The Public Concession Takes a Different Stance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that, regarding the French Concession authorities' declaration that they will not interact with Germans within the concession, reporters inquired with the Municipal Council yesterday (the 13th) about the Council's attitude toward the rights of Germans, whether Jewish or not, within the Public Concession. According to a representative of the Municipal Council, the Public Concession allows people of all nationalities to live and do business, so the above question does not arise. It is noted that the French Concession Municipal Council declared on Thursday, through the French Consul General, that it had received instructions from Paris not to have any dealings with Germans and not to issue any construction or business licenses to holders of German passports. However, the Municipal Council is not subject to the sole control of any national government, and no capital city can issue orders to the Municipal Council, as the Municipal Council is only subject to the control of the Consular Body organized by the Consuls General of various countries stationed in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>The "Turtle" Trademark Lawsuit; Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer Are Accused of Counterfeiting Trademarks</h3>
<p>Chen Taiyan from Ningbo is in the Western medicine business. His Meiling Pharmacy recently produced a tonic called Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer (also known as Wealth, Honor, and Prosperity) Kidney-Invigorating Pills. When it was launched, Chen published large-scale advertisements in various newspapers in Shanghai. It has been sold for more than half a year. Recently, Han Longzhou, the owner of the 63 Industrial Company, claimed that his company's Kidney Qi Pills had a turtle depicted on the trademark.</p>
<p>A Turtle Was Drawn</p>
<p>And Chen's product also has a turtle, which he believes is an allusion to counterfeiting. Initially, they published attacking articles in newspapers. Now, they have hired lawyers to file a lawsuit with the criminal court of the First Special District Court against Chen Taiyan for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce, requesting that Chen be convicted of counterfeiting. At the same time, they filed a civil suit, requesting that Chen Taiyan be ordered to stop using the</p>
<p>Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer</p>
<p>Name and destroy the bottles and boxes printed with the trademark, as well as publish an apology advertisement in various newspapers for three days. On the afternoon of the 14th, this case was heard by Judge Fang Qinghuan, who summoned the defendant Chen Taiyan. Chen Taiyan hired lawyers Qian Xingzhong, Rao Guangzu, Zhu Qichao, and others to appear in court and defend him, presenting the following evidence: (1) The defendant's product has already been submitted to the Trademark Bureau for</p>
<p>Legal Approval</p>
<p>And has a certificate of approval. (2) It has passed the inspection of the Municipal Council. (3) It has been resolved by the joint meeting of the Shanghai New Medicine Industry Association and the Pharmaceutical Industry Association to notify all members to sell it on consignment. (4) The color of the defendant's box is green, while the plaintiff's box is black. (5) The defendant's medicine is yellow, while the plaintiff's medicine is coffee-colored. (6) The turtle in the plaintiff's trademark</p>
<p>Is Very Large, While the defendant's trademark, in addition to a small turtle, also has three animals: tiger, bear, and deer. In this way, the defendant's product, regardless of the difference in the name, is clearly completely different in terms of medicine color, box color, and trademark. Customers can tell at a glance that they are two completely different products. How can it be said to be counterfeiting? Moreover, if the plaintiff in this case believes that there is a similarity in the trademark, he can</p>
<p>File a Dispute</p>
<p>With the Trademark Bureau according to the law. Now, the plaintiff does not seek this but violates the provisions of the Trademark Law and directly files a lawsuit. Moreover, the lawsuit was not filed when the defendant's drug was launched but several months later, which is obviously deliberately making trouble and should be rejected by the court, declaring the defendant innocent. After questioning by Judge Fang, the case was adjourned and will be summoned again after investigation.</p>
<h3>A Swindler Defrauds People of Money; The Civil Suit Concludes; The Defendant Admits He Cannot Afford to Repay</h3>
<p>Wei Kuishun from Shaoxing, who worked as a runner in the Yishengheng Woolen Store at No. 64 Xingsheng Street, met Yang Dongsheng, a young con artist from Suzhou, in early July of this year while walking on Villemont Road. Yang was performing sorcery and boasting that he had a wonderful method to turn one yuan into ten yuan, and that poor people could become rich immediately. Wei</p>
<p>Mistakenly Believed It Was True</p>
<p>On the tenth day of this month, he took 1,000 yuan of relief money he had received, along with 11 yuan in small change he had on him, to Villemont Road to ask Yang to perform the transformation. Yang then colluded with his gang, Zhou Yunfei and Yuan from Ningbo, to set up a room in the Nanyang Small Hotel in Nanyang Bridge, ordering Wei to put the banknotes in a Buddhist yellow bag and kneel in front of a clay statue, waiting for them to perform the magic for three hours, after which it would turn into 10,000 yuan. Wei obediently held the yellow cloth bag and knelt in front of the statue,</p>
<p>Praying With His Eyes Closed</p>
<p>Yang and the others took this opportunity to flee with the money. Wei opened his eyes and looked into the cloth bag and found a roll of waste newspaper. After being defrauded, Wei reported the theft to the police station. The French police escorted him to the Second Special Court, where he was sentenced to 30 days of detention for false reporting, with a suspended sentence. On August 1, Wei was passing by Yinghua Street when he ran into the con artist Yang Dongsheng, who was also passing by. Wei grabbed him and took him to the Old Gate Police Station, who then transferred him to the Second Court.</p>
<p>Based on the Confession</p>
<p>Zhou Yunfei was subsequently arrested at No. 5 Ziyang Lane, Lafayette Road, and 70 yuan and a large number of swindling tools were found. Yang Dongsheng was sentenced to four months of imprisonment and Zhou Yunfei to six months of imprisonment for joint fraud, with a concurrent fine of 200 yuan each. The accompanying civil suit was heard by the Immigration Court. The case was heard by Judge Li of the First Special Court in the Civil Division 7 the day before yesterday. The plaintiff, Wei Kuishun, entrusted lawyer Xu Wufang to represent him in court, stating the</p>
<p>Swindling Process</p>
<p>As before, the court questioned the defendants Yang and Zhou, who confessed that they had only received 500 yuan of the stolen money, and the rest had been taken by someone named Yuan. We only had 70 yuan left, and the rest has already been used up. We are currently unable to repay it. The court reviewed the statements and announced the conclusion of the trial, scheduling the sentencing for the 18th.</p>
<h3>Husband Sells Drugs; Wife Arrested</h3>
<p>Lu Da from Nantong, at 5 a.m. on the 10th of this month, was carrying a net basket containing six cans of biscuits, hired a rickshaw, and planned to go to the Bund to take a boat back home. At the intersection of Aiduoa Road and East Xin Bridge, he was searched by detectives, who found ten bags of morphine in the biscuit cans. He was taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. During the investigation at the police station, Lu confessed that he had bought the morphine from Chen Mingfu at No. 3 Mianshou Lane, Kangti Road. Detectives went to arrest Chen Mingfu, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. His wife, Chen Zhangshi, was arrested and sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court the day before yesterday. Judge Liao interrogated her. The police lawyer requested an adjournment to be tried together with Lu Da. Chen Zhangshi confessed that her husband had been doing morphine business for a short time and that she did not know where her husband had fled. The court reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained pending trial together with Lu Da.</p>

<p>At around 10 a.m. yesterday, at the entrance of No. 54 Molly Street, Vegetable Market Street, French Concession, a vegetable vendor named Li Hede (57 years old) from Tianjin and a person nicknamed Ning Bi Agou were fighting over a stall site.

Meanwhile, the police are looking for the murderer, hoping to catch and interrogate him.</p>

At 6 p.m. on the 8th of this month, he and his wife, Ms. Wang, were having dinner at their home at No. 4, Lane 349, North Henan Road, when his older sister, Ms. Zhu Li, arrived and demanded the repayment of 50 yuan owed to her.

<h3>Ministry of Education Establishes Thirteenth Middle School</h3>
<p>Expands Enrollment of Eleventh Middle School</p>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education, considering the large number of out-of-school youths in the war zone of Jiangxi Province, has specially established the National Thirteenth Middle School, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry of Education, also considering the large number of out-of-school youths who have retreated from various war zones to Hunan Province, has specially expanded the enrollment of the National Eleventh Middle School to accommodate them.</p>
<h3>Current Status of the National Sun Yat-sen University Graduate School</h3>
<p>Establishes Three Institutes for Literature, Teacher Education, and Agriculture and Adds a Division of Engineering</p>
<p>(Chengjiang Correspondence) The Graduate School of National Sun Yat-sen University was established in the 24th year and is divided into three research institutes for literature, education, and agriculture. The Institute of Literature is divided into the Department of Chinese Language and Literature and the Department of History. The Institute of Education is divided into the Department of Education and the Department of Educational Psychology. The Institute of Agriculture is divided into the Department of Agronomy and Forestry and the Department of Soil Science. Since moving from Guangzhou to Chengjiang last winter, everything has proceeded as usual. Recently, in accordance with the Ministry's order, starting from the 28th year, the Institute of Education was renamed the Institute of Teacher Education. Recently, the Ministry ordered the expansion of enrollment and the addition of departments. The Graduate School, in response to environmental needs and the development of research work, changed the enrollment quota for graduate students in each department to a minimum of five students and plans to add a Department of Anthropology in the Institute of Literature, a Department of English Teaching in the Institute of Teacher Education, and a Department of Agronomy in the Institute of Agriculture. These additions will be officially established upon approval by the Ministry of Education. Since the 24th year, the graduate students of the three institutes have completed their research periods and have taken the master's degree examination three times in accordance with regulations. A total of twenty-two students have been awarded master's degrees in literature, education, and agriculture, including two from the Institute of Literature, seven from the Institute of Education, and one from the Institute of Agriculture in the first session of the 25th year; two from the Institute of Literature and four from the Institute of Agriculture in the second session of the 26th year; and the third master's degree examination in the 27th year was held in Chengjiang County from August 7th to 8th of this year.

<h3>Falsely Accused of Being Guerrillas; Extortion Attempt Exposed; Four Youths Arrested Together</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhaogen, a local resident, 18 years old, currently studying at the China Vocational School on Carter Road, residing at 77 Panqing Road, French Concession, was suddenly visited by four well-dressed individuals at around 7:00 PM yesterday. The four claimed to be officers of the Japanese military headquarters. One of them, who was shorter, even claimed to be Japanese. The four told Zhu that Zhu had a friend named Zhang Yong, who was a guerrilla member and had been arrested. According to Zhang's confession, Zhu was also a guerrilla member, so they had come to investigate. They then repeatedly threatened and demanded 500 yuan to settle the matter. Zhu agreed to pay 300 yuan. Although the negotiation was successful, Zhu did not have the cash on hand. Zhu asked a friend to go out and raise the money. The friend realized that they were attempting to extort money and immediately reported it to the police. The police immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, who rushed to the scene in police vehicles and arrested the four individuals. According to the individual who impersonated a Japanese officer, his name was Lu Xiaofeng, 19 years old, a local resident. The other three individuals identified themselves as Chao Weizu, 19 years old, from Changzhou; Yan Wenkui, 19 years old, from Ningbo; and Guo Jiarong, 21 years old, from Changzhou. They confessed to attempting to extort money. After interrogation, the police chief ordered them to be detained and sent to the Second Special District Court for further investigation.</p>

<p>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Shoes and Food</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang is now the Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. In his childhood, he was just a child picking up scraps in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Because of poverty, he never even wore handmade cloth shoes when he was young. At home, he usually wore "second-hand shoes," which were old, worn-out shoes that were mended a little by a shoemaker. It is said that Feng Yuxiang had a foot ailment because he wore ill-fitting second-hand shoes at that time. When picking up scraps in the wilderness, he wore straw sandals; sometimes, he didn't even wear straw sandals and went barefoot.</p>
<p>Now, he still loves to wear cloth shoes made by his wife. He doesn't even want to look at Western-style leather shoes.</p>
<p>As for food, he also had a hard time when he was young. He rarely had meat more than a few times a year. For three meals a day, it was either sesame cakes or corn buns. In the 22nd year of the Republic, when he went to Shanghai, someone criticized him for eating sesame cakes and fried dough sticks for lunch. He said, "Being able to eat sesame cakes and fried dough sticks is like ascending to heaven for me!"</p>
<p>There is also an interesting anecdote: Whenever he went to Baoding, he always went to a food store called Ping Lao Jing on South Street to eat beef buns. Someone asked him, "Why?" He said, "Because the owner of that store once pawned a pair of gold-plated bracelets in a pawnshop. When he went to redeem them, the shop assistant gave him a pair of genuine gold bracelets, but he still returned them. I feel honored to eat at a store like that, not because the buns they make taste good."</p>
<h3>Hunan Students' Homespun Uniforms</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The development of education in Hunan is unmatched in the country. Taking the provincial capital as an example, schools are everywhere, and those in charge are able to work hard and manage effectively. The students also have a spirited and energetic attitude. As for the simple student uniforms, in the bustling streets, the students you see, whether male or female, wear a full set of homespun uniforms all year round. They rarely wear silk or woolen fabrics. In general, female students not only wear homespun skirts and jackets but also do not wear makeup. As for the homespun raw materials for making clothes, they are purely spun, woven, and dyed by themselves in the countryside. Only this can be called completely domestic products.</p>
<p>Their clothing is mostly a short jacket and short skirt. The upper body wears a plain-colored homespun jacket, and the lower body is paired with a plain-colored homespun skirt that reaches the knees. Their foreheads are covered with hair, and their eyes are bright. On the right side of their chests, the name of the school and the school-assigned number are embroidered with white yarn. Although they do not wear makeup, their light and plain attire has a unique style and reveals a natural and healthy beauty, which is unmatched by the female students in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who have bobbed their hair and wear fashionable clothes.</p>
<h3>Marshal Soy Sauce</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>"Tonghai Soy Sauce is the best in Yunnan, Marshal Soy Sauce is the best in Tonghai." There are six or seven soy sauce manufacturers in Tonghai, and among the six or seven, Marshal Soy Sauce is the leader. Because Marshal Soy Sauce has been famous for its delicious taste and pure quality for three generations since its founding. Cooking dishes with it enhances the flavor, so in cooking, good and large dishes are all eager to use it to boast about their cooking skills. In recent years, its reputation has grown and sales have increased. There are no fewer than dozens of distributors in the surrounding eight prefectures and districts. Travelers passing through Tonghai also consider it a rare treat to buy and take a bottle with them. In Kunming, its value is said to be ten times higher. The total annual output is more than 200,000 catties. In terms of output, it can be considered a marshal. What is Marshal Soy Sauce? It is the famous "Tiao Ding Zhai."</p>
<p>Then, where did the name "Marshal" come from? According to the owner of "Tiao Ding Zhai," the name "Marshal Soy Sauce" has existed since ten years before the Republic of China. Because Tang Jiyao, the military governor of Yunnan, was very particular about food and drink, and every dish was inseparable from soy sauce, and he only ate soy sauce from "Tiao Ding Zhai." Because Tang Jiyao once held the rank of marshal (the Grand Marshal at the time was President Sun Yat-sen), the soy sauce was named after his honor. This is just like how Emperor Wu of Han named his book after obtaining a tripod, and how Shusun named his son after winning a victory. It is a marvel similar to the "Governor's Steamed Buns" of Yiliang, a strange anecdote in Yunnan.</p>
<h3>Walking and Health</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>If you can take the bus less when you go out, it can also improve your health, it's just that most people ignore this. People who live in cities are used to being pampered and always use cars and chartered cars for transportation. On weekdays, they only know that movie theaters and opera houses are places of entertainment and do not exercise. These young masters enjoy all the pleasures of the world, but their bodies are mostly weak and often get sick. This is the drawback of walking less and exercising less.</p>
<p>For working people, due to time constraints, in a city like Shanghai, they mostly take rickshaws, trams, and buses. In terms of physique, working people are also mostly thin and weak. Now, many people have felt the weakness of their bodies. The main reason is the lack of exercise, but some are limited by age, and some are due to the lack of public sports facilities in the city of Shanghai. Even though they know the drawbacks of lacking exercise, they do not exercise.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no fixed format for exercise methods; in other words, as long as a person's hands, feet, and body are constantly moving, it is also exercise. Therefore, a laborer is actually exercising all day long, even if he does not do various exercises, while only the young masters who sit in the office or just eat without doing anything are truly lacking exercise. We can exercise to strengthen our physique and make our bodies strong.</p>
<p>In my opinion, walking is also exercise and can make the body healthy, because when you walk, your hands and feet have to move, and your body also has to move. So I believe that walking can also improve health. I remember when I was in school, if it didn't rain every morning, I always walked to school. I had to walk along Avenue Edward VII and Beijing Road and turn into Sichuan Road, walking a long way in the morning and evening. At that time, my body was better than when I had not come to Shanghai. Recently, due to the war, my income has decreased, and I have also been practicing thrift, so I don't take the bus much when I go out and walk more. But recently my body has also been better than it was a year ago. I rarely exercise on weekdays; therefore, I have realized that walking does improve health.</p>
<p>In a city like Shanghai, some people have to take the bus because of their jobs, and some people pretend to be rich because they have money. Some jobs are not related, and they are not wealthy, but they still take the bus to save effort, while at the same time knowing that they lack exercise and are very weak, and wanting to exercise but are either limited by time or not good at exercising. In this situation, we might as well replace exercise with walking. It may not be impossible to improve our health!</p>
<h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
<p>Shanxi people eat vinegar more than anyone else in the world. Also, women in Shanxi, after the age of 30, feel it difficult to walk without three legs; the so-called "three legs" are two feet and a cane.</p>
<p>The current location of the capital of Guizhou Province—Guiyang—has a road called "Salt Row Road." More than half of the shops on that road are salt shops, and most of the residents are salt merchants.</p>
<p>Mr. Soong Tse-ven often enjoys riding alone in the green fields in his spare time.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Zhengting, the first ambassador to the United States, always had a cigarette or cigar in his mouth. When he had nothing to do at home, he would sit alone in a room, close his eyes, and smoke to pass the time.</p>
<p>Hui people like to eat beef and mutton, just like Shandong people like to eat green onions. Also, Hui people, regardless of men, women, old, or young, bathe once a week and take a small bath five times a day.</p>
<p>The Javanese live a simple life. They sleep and eat on the ground. What they wear, whether men or women, is just one "sarong." A sarong is shaped like an apron. Also, the people of Siam wear "sarongs."</p>
<p>German women are proud to marry men in military uniforms. Also, no makeup can be seen on the faces of German women. (Lian)</p>
<h3>A WEEK'S ECONOMICAL MENU</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Shrimp is extremely expensive these days. Not to mention that it's rare to see it in everyday home cooking; even going to a restaurant and paying a high price for a plate of stir-fried shrimp, there are more green peas than shrimp, which isn't enough to satisfy one's appetite. As for whole prawns, they are long out of season, and although you can occasionally find them in Cantonese restaurants, they are all from the freezer. In my economical menu, shrimp has almost no place recently. If you absolutely must taste shrimp, then you have to rely on small white shrimp. Although small white shrimp also cost four or five cents an ounce, buying ten cents' worth, with added side dishes, can be divided into two bowls, enough for two meals, day and night. The methods are very common, and every household knows how to make them. One is scrambled eggs with small white shrimp, another is braising small white shrimp with tofu; another is stir-frying small white shrimp with chives, and another is braising small white shrimp with edamame, fragrant mushrooms, water chestnut tips, diced water bamboo shoots, and dried tofu, which is somewhat like "stir-fried ten delicacies."</p>
<p>Monday: Stir-fried broad beans with sliced pork, braised tofu with white shrimp, pickled mustard greens, bean sprouts.</p>
<p>Tuesday: Stir-fried shredded beef with onions, sweet and sour fried ribbonfish, stir-fried bok choy, pan-fried stinky dried tofu.</p>
<p>Wednesday: Braised meatballs with green vegetables, scrambled eggs with small white shrimp, spinach and tofu soup, stir-fried wheat gluten with shrimp roe.</p>
<p>Thursday: Curried sliced beef, clear steamed crucian carp soup, braised assorted vegetables, pickled mustard greens with yellow soybean sprouts.</p>
<p>Friday: Stir-fried vegetables with shredded pork, braised tofu with crab roe, stir-fried bean threads with green vegetables, stir-fried broad beans with sweet sauce.</p>
<p>Saturday: Tomato beef soup, braised white fish with bean curd sheets, braised cabbage, mashed edamame pods.</p>
<p>Sunday: Stir-fried meat with sauce, pan-fried yellow croaker, shepherd's purse mixed with celery.</p>
<h3>THE MOBILE HOME INSIDE AN AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>—Including the four aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation—</p>
<p>—Fully equipped with household facilities—</p>
<p>In America, there is a young traveler, Mr. James Smith, who has loved traveling since he was a child. Therefore, he designed and created a trailer for his car, which serves as a temporary home when traveling. The car is about seven feet wide and twenty-five feet long, with a streamlined design at both ends. Inside the car, there are three exquisitely equipped small rooms, and all the equipment in the rooms is modern. It includes hot and cold water taps, toilets, bathrooms, power supply, dining room, bedroom, etc., and can accommodate the living and dining needs of eight people. After the travel trailer was completed, he drove it from his hometown of Xuebo to the western coast of the state of Florida in the United States.</p>
<p>This novel way of traveling has aroused the interest of many Americans. Many fashionable people have followed suit. In less than five months, hundreds of them were found on this coast. As a result, some speculators have opened grocery stores, restaurants, hospitals, and even barber shops, bookstores, and laundries in these types of cars, providing everything needed. Therefore, this communal car family can maintain more than ten days of independent living without relying on any external supplies. If they get tired of playing in place A, they can immediately move from place A to place B.</p>
<p>The smallest of these types of cars can also accommodate the lives of a couple and a child. The car contains one or two small rooms, and all the equipment is very simple and exquisite. Common ones include a dining table, two single beds, two foldable chairs, a water tank that can hold twenty gallons, a refrigerator, a wardrobe, a wooden box for storing dining utensils, a bathtub with a showerhead, an electric stove for cooking, and a radio. Every item in the car can be folded and hidden when not needed. In short, the arrangement of each item is not annoying or inconvenient. In particular, every place in the corner of the car roof is properly utilized. At the rear of the car, a small platform is cleverly installed. When driving in the wild, you can sit on the platform and look at the scenery. As for the lights in the car, they usually use storage batteries, but in areas close to the city, they can also be connected to the city's alternating current.</p>
<p>Every summer, when the weather is hot, most of these cars drive to California to escape the heat. Speculators there have also established a square specifically for car families to rest, called the Car Family Concentration Camp. Staying in this concentration camp for a week costs one dollar per car. After paying the fee, you can enjoy free electricity and tap water. Therefore, tens of thousands of car families go there every year to escape the heat, and fifteen gas stations have also been established for these many car families.</p>
<p>In addition to living and traveling, this mobile family car can also be used for other purposes. Some people use it to open mobile shops, movie theaters use it as a mobile movie theater, and when film companies go to the wild to shoot outdoor scenes, movie stars can use it for makeup and rest. Hospitals use it as a mobile treatment room, and swimmers can use it as a changing room and rest room. In short, this type of car family is a novel discovery and a very interesting type of small family.</p>

If you want to participate, you can send the items to the Medical Bookstore at 246 Meibaige Road. In order to find out more about the exhibition, I made a special trip to get a copy of the regulations for soliciting items, and also conducted a brief interview.</p>
<p>Indeed, the scope of this exhibition is very broad. In terms of classification, it can be listed as follows: (1) Tools for recording language; (2) Books and newspapers; (3) Charts and graphs; (4) Language and local customs; (5) Language seen on objects; (6) Lecture topics; (7) Performances; (8) Other items related to language. From this, we can easily see the broad scope of the items solicited for this exhibition. If you have research and interest in language items and actively participate, then this exhibition will definitely be quite spectacular.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding tools for recording language, models of knot-tying and knife pens, pens, ink, oracle bones, bark, bamboo slips, typewriters, printing tools, etc. are all included in the collection. In terms of books and newspapers: grammar books, dictionaries, newspapers, magazines, vernacular literature, Christian Bibles, Taoist scriptures, Buddhist scriptures, and texts in various Chinese minority languages, such as Manchu, Mongolian, Tibetan, Xixia, and Han Chinese books, etc. Charts and graphs include paintings, photographs, rubbings, calligraphy, inscriptions, and artistic characters related to language. Language and local customs include the Eight Trigrams, auspicious characters, auspicious words, talismans, and incantations. Objects include coins and stamps with characters on them. Lecture topics include language development, dialect research, and modern tools for transmitting language, such as telegraphs, telephones, wireless radio, and printing. Performances include performances of Braille, shorthand, telephones, new writing systems, dialects, and flag signals.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that this exhibition is rarely seen in previous exhibitions, and such an exhibition can fully and clearly demonstrate the historical and evolutionary stages of the Chinese language. At the opening, the organizers will also compile and print a bilingual catalog of all the exhibits, free of charge, to be distributed to guests. I think people who care about language at that time will definitely rush to be the first to see it.</p>

<h3>THE LIFE OF A HARDWORKING STUDENT</h3>
<p>— A Letter</p>
<p>I am a student who has been affected by the war and is suffering from economic oppression. I am currently studying in the senior high school department of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School. Now I will tell the people of society about my daily life situation, and I hope that students in Shanghai who are economically wealthy will not waste money. My living situation is now described in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) Financial Income and Expenditure</p>
<p>Income: Relatives' subsidy of 60 yuan per semester,稿费 of newspapers and magazines, about 50 yuan per semester, and the rest relies on students' subsidies. Expenses: Tuition fee of 35 yuan, accommodation fee of 10 yuan, food fee of 50 yuan, and other miscellaneous expenses for books and stationery of 25 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Source and Destination of Books</p>
<p>(1) Borrowed from students' fathers and brothers and relatives; (2) Purchased from old book stalls. This is the source of books. Their destination is also divided into two types: (1) Borrowed books are returned to the original owner; (2) Purchased books are sold to freshmen or second-hand bookstores. Therefore, after reading for a year, there are no books left after reading for a year.</p>
<p>(3) Utilization of Paper and Notebooks</p>
<p>Each piece of draft paper is written on three times: the first time is written in pencil, the second time is written in pen, and the third time is written in ink. Exercise books and composition books, etc., in addition to slightly adding a few copies, are all re-stapled from the unused or half-used ones from the previous semester.</p>
<p>(4) Diet and Living</p>
<p>Get up at 5:00 am and go to bed at 10:00 pm. In addition to reading and working time, all remaining rest time is only 40 to 50 minutes. In terms of diet, I eat nothing but one bowl of porridge and two meals a day, all year round. As for laundry, everything from quilts to socks is washed by myself.</p>
<p>The above is my daily life situation, which can be described as extremely difficult. If my relatives stop subsidizing me one day, then I will not be able to continue my studies, and the income from稿费 is not absolutely guaranteed. Compared with the children of wealthy families, the proportion of their lives can be described as heaven and hell. Therefore, the purpose of this manuscript is to hope that poor students like me will try their best to work hard in their lives; on the one hand, I hope that wealthy students will use this good environment to study hard and not waste time and money.</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>SNOWFLAKE DOUBLE BLOOM</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Winter Carnival"</p>
<p>"Snowflake Double Bloom" writes about the love story of a pair of sisters (Jill Buster and Ann Buster), with the winter festival at Dartmouth College as an interlude. The playwright uses the different experiences of the two sisters to clarify that young men and women should not treat love as a child's play, which is a good meaning, but in terms of writing skills, there are some shortcomings. Jill just divorced Duke Alex and met her old lover from six years ago, John, a young professor at Dartmouth College, at the festival. Their love comes to fruition, and the emotional process is well written, but Ann's infatuation with sweet words, abandoning Mike and transferring her love to Count Lenbog, is too hasty. Moreover, the reporter's running around by Tiger and Tang Ruinos, father and son, and the average development of the festival, weakened Jill's power to persuade Ann. At the same time, it made the whole play appear unusually loose. For example, at the end, Duke Alex brought a large number of newspaper reporters to visit Jill's whereabouts, and the simultaneous writing of the ice skating high jump competition made the director's hands and feet very obvious when Jill and John got together, and Ann and Mike reconciled.</p>
<p>Just because of the parallel development of these four lines (Jill and John; Ann and Mike: Tiger and Tang Ruinos; and the festival), the whole play cannot be tightly organized. The most important scene, Jill persuading Ann, can only be perfunctorily passed in the dance. But there are also a few very good scenes, such as John saying goodbye to Jill, the bleak atmosphere is very strong. John and Jill's night at a friend's house: wiping pots and taking care of children... The side description of them reliving their old dreams is also delicate and exquisite. That is, Jill dressed up to go to the dance floor and snatch Count Lenbog from Ann's arms. The different emotions of each person were also very moving.</p>
<p>The so-called "un" actress Ann Shirley Dan, on the contrary, Jill's role is played very well, but according to yesterday's news, she has been selected as one of Hollywood's four "un queens". The movie merchants' publicity is really confusing!</p>
<h3>AFTER THE RAIN, THE SKY CLEARS</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Establish Medical Science and Building a School, Thinking about Expanding Village Governance and Entrusting Children to a Suitable Place</p>
<p>However, Village Chief Zhu has always done things his own way and does not promote himself. Only a few people who know him admire his village governance and are pragmatic. People who don't know him still don't know him, and he doesn't hope that people will know him in any way. He is truly a person who "does not resent being unknown to others." However, the number of people who know about Freedom Village is gradually increasing. In this era of dispersing from the city to the countryside, many people have taken a fancy to this Freedom Village. For example, the He sisters initially wanted to go to Freedom Village because their father disliked Shanghai. Later, they suddenly launched a plan for a silk weaving factory, so the silk weaving factory was designed to open there. Because in the midst of this urban dispersal, no one wanted to open a factory in Shanghai anymore. Because land prices in Shanghai are expensive, labor costs are expensive, and everything is considered uneconomical. Since Freedom Village is the most suitable place for urban dispersal, it has gradually prospered, and land rents have also increased, which is inevitable. In addition to land rents, we must talk about village-run enterprises. Among the village-run enterprises, the first thing to talk about is collective farms. Freedom Village has several collective farms, all of which belong to the village. They divided them into the First Collective Farm, the Second Collective Farm,... until the Seventh Collective Farm. Naturally, these collective farms vary in size, depending on the region. However, this income is really the majority of the village's income. Just saying that Freedom Village has several nurseries, the annual appropriation is not small, and they are managed by several agricultural experts. Because the cultivation business in various provinces in inland China is rising like a storm. Many were originally wastelands that had never been reclaimed before. Some were originally cultivated land, but because of years of war, the old were transferred to gullies and ravines, and the strong were scattered in all directions, leaving the land barren. Now we have to reorganize from scratch. In addition to rice fields and wheat fields, trees are planted everywhere. What kind of soil is suitable for planting what kind of tree, this does not necessarily require agricultural experts with high skills, and even the old farmers and gardeners in China in the past can understand. Therefore, we must go to various farms to search for seedlings, on the one hand, to cultivate forests, even if it was originally a barren mountain, we must now teach it to become a forest. Village Chief Zhu said that he was a speculator in this regard. Because when Freedom Village was just organized and established, he set up several nurseries. That kind of nursery does not require much capital, and it can be opened by simply opening up a few acres of wasteland. Who knew that now, the seedlings in Freedom Village are famous throughout the country, but they have become oversupplied. (191)</p>
