<p>爲整個人類之文明福利計，詎宜世界第二决大戰？更就國際剖析言之：中國方在抗戰建國，兼程並進之中；雖世界之或和或戰，必予中國以利害參半之影響，然所亟既惟禦侮圖存，心力專注於斯，則於世界和戰，自惟視爲第二事而不感甚深趣味。日本侵略經年，筋疲力竭，前途茫茫，欲罷不能，以此反常之局，對世界和戰或別有會心，而惟恐天下之不亂；然自居神聖，號稱反共，而坐視蘇俄拍賣漁塲，不敢遺以一矢，逡巡而退；則彼亦未欲擴大戰爭，於可覘知。至於英法，往日委曲求全，逆來順受；馴致綏靖技窮，痛切灼膚，進退兩難，狼狽萬狀；然其主觀意識，固猶和平砥柱不啻也。蘇俄以一國社會主義爲標榜，自可沉機觀變，灑然於大漩渦之外；然再三五年計畫之所成就，所誇亦僅謂不虞暴鄰侵略而已；謂將隔岸觀火，亦以羽毛更豐之後，其機會爲更勝，顧非所語於目前。北美合衆國，遠隔重洋，舉足重輕；政府既矜持，而在野黨之所以獵取人心者猶以孤立爲得計，是固厭惡戰禍之徵。義大利呌囂奔突，貪嗔妬恨；磨刀霍霍，一試於阿比西尼亞，再試於西班牙；然所謂願望，所睨視於地中海者，僅旁敲側擊之有聲有色；謂有大勇，克副大欲，則其深入西班牙境內之武士，猶爲弗期哥將軍所制，未越雷池一步；誠哉黷武，在阿西境內而已。德意志巧取豪奪，拓疆萬里而兵不血刃，叱咤風雲於歐大陸，氣燄不可嚮邇；然謂將以一戰而爲世界盟主，則其主觀客觀之一切條件，猶爲今日所未備；而彼之不戰而定奧捷，允未可取爲好戰之明證。至於其他國家，進不能爲决勝之因素，退不足以自力謀自全；一朝大戰，求毌爲流彈所犧牲之不可必得，况敢徼倖漁利耶？是衷誠禱祝和平實所皆然。由此析論，謂每一國，無不願國際和平；甚至謂每一人，恐懼大戰，詛咒大戰。亦無不可。顧乃事實上之激盪演變至於今日，竟無復絲毫根據，無論其爲理論，爲信仰，爲方法，爲力量。猶得予人以一綫和平之希望；一似大戰之爆發，祗是時間問題。夫人類自命爲萬物之靈，顧乃自殺相殺於不能自制，豈不大可憫耶！溯自德國之亡捷克，於今僅五日；人類心靈，頓然改觀。蓋德國造此事實之所說明者：野心無饜足，且得步進步，不知所底，一也。條的諾言信誓，等於廢紙，廢話，絕無價值，二也。綏靖政策徒爲愚人說夢，三也。惟此三者，不僅英國首相張伯倫，法國總理達拉第，義國首相墨索里尼，爲所欺，爲所賣；且以一國之暴行宣告國際外交之死刑。自此而後，一切語言文字，皆成無用之長物；國際相處，乃僅存兩途，非忍受暴行即抵抗暴行而已。英美法諸國至是乃亦不復隱忍，於是英國首相與美國副國務卿，相繼發爲絕不容情之斥責；英法兩國除抗議外，各召回其駐德使節；英國有捐棄黨見，組織全國一致內閣之議；法國國會成立全權法案，授政府以權宜之大權；美國對於德國商貨課以百分二十五之懲罰稅，爲變相之杜絕貿易，且於空軍之製造與空軍人員之訓練驟取戰時狀態。凡此舉措，固未可遽謂必以大戰爲後果，然其爲大戰前夕之景象，則無疑義。抑不但若是而已，德國亡捷之不足，更向羅馬尼亞提出經濟要求，將夷羅國人民爲德國永遠之農奴，羅國政府乞援於英；而波蘭，南斯拉夫，保加利亞，希臘，土爾其等五國並表示爲羅國禦暴之後盾，此爲大可注意之一事。東歐中歐各國之有少數日耳曼族雜居境內者，乘機思動，要求率土以歸其宗邦；可見德國之鷹犬四佈，動輙有關全局，此爲大可注意之又一事。義國有日內向法國即提耍求之說，此爲大可注意之又一事。此三事者，允一觸即發爲大戰之導火綫也。夫任何國家，皆願國際和平而詛咒大戰，有如上述；然大戰幾於卽在目前者，固何爲而使然歟？是政治之惰性也，是人類之惰性也。蓋野心國家之野心無饜足，敝屣一切條的諾言信誓，以及愚弄綏靖政策，德義日慣爲之矣，不自亡捷克始也。誠使遏之於最初，則以維持原狀爲惰性；及優容之，放任之，直接間接獎進之，因是而氣倣矣，欲奢矣，所獲漸多，憑藉漸厚，實力漸豐矣，於是以昂進爲惰性，遽難使之復歸靜止。况數年來之「和平第一」論，既使公道正義，黯然無光，弱小之爲所犧牲者，不一而足；復使黷武者針對和平而逞其耀武揚威之姿態，售其要挾進攻之方術。大局若斯，固有由來也。時至今日，各國若不抵抗暴行，惟有忍受暴行；有效之抵抗暴行。要在出以主動的制止，實力之差，可望以戰止戰；若更因循而至於禍迫眉睫之日，則彼所獲既多，憑藉既厚，實力既豐，誰家天下，未可知矣。</p>

<p>政府盡力照料難民</p>
<p>大陸報云、南方浸禮敎會斯丹林女士、甫自桂林抵滬、昨（十八日）語記者、廣西省府處理因戰事而起之重負、成績卓著、而不試圖將其責仟移交他人負之、難民雖自各方</p>
<p>湧入桂林</p>
<p>、但省府以有系統之方法、照料彼等、余雖未目覩、惟聞沿重要交通路綫、每隔十里、均已設有登記處、難民向登記處塡報姓名、當局對赤貧者免費供給運送便利、並日給洋三角、已往兩月中晨起多雨故使桂林不遭日機轟炸、此期間、雖聞警報若干次、但未投彈、每逢警報高鳴、即起罕見之景象、蓋桂林之二十萬居民、在特造之階梯上、拾級而登、越城墻而赴附近山上石穴暫避也、警報時期內、平民雖悉數撤退、但警察仍駐守崗位、若某屋被彈擊中、此肇警察卽看守該財產、以待屋主返家、若某人之寓所被摧毀當局以若干公共建築物</p>
<p>供彼棲身</p>
<p>待其能建新屋爲止、軍興後、生活程序已有更變、晨間有遭空襲之虞、故不得不於午後三時至午夜間經營商業、已往兩月中、雖未遭空襲、但以前曾遭轟炸、城內房屋、已毀其半、至於工業合作社、桂林尙無成立、但刻在初步調查中、桂林商業、似頗繁榮、無論何地之民衆、無不準備抵抗日軍、到處均見軍事活動之徵象、傷兵之友會爲援助傷兵之團體、在桂林進行艱鉅之任務云、</p>
<p>蘇北華軍</p>

<p>昭關壩有激戰</p>
<p>泰縣通信、日軍此决大舉進犯蘇北、曾先後侵入淮·泗·阜·寶各縣、除實應隨經華軍收復、損失尙屬輕微外、其他泗陽·漣水·東海·沐陽·阜寗·淮陰·淮安等處、損失甚鉅、茲據調查、淮陰於未放棄前、居民雖已大部疏散、公用事業亦經毀壞、但日軍陷城後、搜掠民間雜物、運走二百餘箱、平民被槍殺者、亦有二百餘人、强姦案件更不計其數、叉阜寗前被日飛機猛烈轟擊、一度侵入縣城後、城內房舍、多數淪爲焦土、居民被屠殺者亦不可勝計、該縣業於前日爲華軍收復、刻正設法安撫地方、其餘各縣、遭刦亦甚慘重、情形尙待調查、淮陰海州兩地、現均在華某部生力軍及武裝民衆圍擊反攻中、戰事異常緊張、淮陰縣城有已爲華軍收復說、又訊、邵伯日軍二百餘名、十日午輕犯華軍昭關壩陣地、砲火猛烈、當經華方守軍奮勇抵抗、激戰至下午、日軍不支潰退、是役斃日軍數十名傷者允衆、消耗子彈更多、華方無甚損失、陳地始終安如盤石、十二日上午日軍用卡車六輛、將日軍傷兵曁屍身由邵伯運往揚州、十二日上午揚州西山黃珏橋日軍與華方游擊隊父發生接觸、十三日晨揚州西南方面亦有砲聲、聞竇家橋遭華軍突襲、日軍亦有傷亡、</p>
<p>宿遷景象蕭條</p>
<p>城內絕無商業</p>
<p>字林報云、去年十一月二十二日、穿梭遷陷落、十二月二日與三日、華軍反攻該城、使日軍於人力與配備兩方俱受重大損失、但未克復之、其後即未作反攻、但華軍至今（二月二十七日）仍在該城東北五哩以內、大部份華軍均在運河東岸、而宿遷則在西岸、其附近之華軍含有各種部隊如中央軍、江蘇省軍與游擊隊是、彼等之砲隊與機械化配備則不足作進攻之用、但於防守、已表現其可驚之力量、在蘇北之軍隊、一般人均認五十七師之訓練與配備最爲精良</p>

<p>開砲應和</p>
<p>並在各處濫投手溜彈、凡對上海夜間之聲響發怨言者、可在此房层中試臥一宵也、難民收容所中、一度容有七八百人、醫院僱員亦在其內、目前己不足六百人、難民大多自購食物煮食、身無分文者、每日二决免費領取食物、迄今爲止、食物與燃料之供給、未曾完全間斷、惟然料會一度稀少而憶、一般商業情况、惡劣之至、此似不必贅言者、宿遷自失陷後、城內絕無經營何種商業者、近有韓人設一商店、出售糖類、啤酒、紙烟、與罐頭物品、若干中國商人、已將大多數貨物自城中運至鄕間村鎭、免遭空襲、今此等貨物之一部份在村鎭與當地市塲上出售、若干小鎮市塲上、買賣土產、貿易頗盛、舶來品日見稀少、人民之家宅毀壞、眷屬離散、哀傷者大有人在、誠最近歷史上悲慘之時期無疑也、</p>
<p>李白戰史</p>
<p>早年入伍卽著功績</p>
<p>訪張國權</p>
<p>廣西的軍政人員，沒有不知道「張老師一的，他是陽朔人，是李宗仁，白崇禧，黃旭初，黃紹竑，諸氏靑年時代的教師、真到現在，他們還是呌他「張老師」因此大家也稱他「張老師」而不名。這也許是他，們四位的碩果僅存的老師，筆者不想錯過訪問他的機會。張、老師的住宅在縣前街，離開縣政府不到五十步，坐西朝東，是一宅雙開間的石訵門房屋，一望而知中落成不久的。一個壯健的孩子把我的名片遞了進去，起先以爲是張老師的孫兒，後來才知道是他唯一的愛子。不一刻，僕人端出茶和紙烟來。接着穿着鐵灰色的湖縐寬袍，登着一雙布鞋的一張老師」，就從第二進的樓屋裏出來會我，他年紀雖已五十六歲，但還沒有留鬚，看上去至少比他的年齡小十歲，那穩健的步履和緊緊的握手，顯出他有過軍人生活的少壯時代，筆者先致問候之意，又說明了訪謁的動機。張老師在遜淸末葉，畢業於保定軍官學校前身的保定協和班第一期，總督是段祺瑞，監督是曲同豐，有步騎砲工輜各科，二年半畢業。協和班第二期畢業後，就改名保定軍官學校了。宣統年間，他在日本士官學校畢業，和雲南蔡松坡，江蘇莊蘊寬等返國，在廣西桂林創辦陸軍小學，李白和兩黃，便是這小學的第一期學生，那時這幾位「高足」還都是十多歲的靑年，但在一百多同學中，便覺得他們「天賦之厚」和「向學之勤」。「並不是因爲他們現在都位居顯要，我再說賣老和恭維他們話」張師說：「德鄰和健生兩位的確精明勇敢，民國初年，我帶過兵，德鄰在我部下當連長，有一决在湖南作戰，他的面頰給子彈穿過了，我呌他下去，他終支持到任務達成後才退出陣地，傷愈後，剛巧有營長出缺，我就把他升了，健生在桂省南方剿匪時，不幸折腿骨，雖送到廣東去醫好了，到現在走路時還顯得有些顚蹶的樣子。他的有决斷是少年時代就如此的」。他自己說：他原是個無產階級，現在所住的新屋子，就是這幾位「同學」在去年替他蓋造的。他過去住在香港，回鄉後，也常到挂林去走走，「不在李家住宿，就在白家吃飯」。眞是一位値得敬重的老師。就在筆者訪問他的那天傍晚，張老師竟踏着泥濘的村道到樂羣社來答訪我，眞覺得是件不敢當的事。那晚他戴着一頂皮帽，握着一根銅頭細竹的旱烟管，稍微有一些老態，但興會很好。講了許多陽朔的風土人情。他去時天已黑了。他笑着說「你到陽朔來玩過以後，應該要向我們納些稅。」我也笑着說：「那麼說吧！」他道：「請你多在報紙上寫些文章，爲本地的人民多招來一些遊客。」我要送他回去，他堅持不允，說是：「在自己家裏，那要各人來領路，」只得罷了。張氏復爲木報題」民族金聲」四字·張老師名國權字震歐，現任第五路軍總部中將參軍，在軍事策劃上，對李白常有建議，多受採納。（完）</p>

<p>第二循環比賽成績不計塲地停止開放提前結束</p>
<p>西聯足球甲組賽、昨東華在逸園、雖以二比三再敗於法商、但東華已獲甲組之亞軍、昨賽勝負、無關得失也、其原因述之如下、逸園球塲、因須增舖草皮、決定提前停止開放、跑馬廳不久亦將滿期、塲地方面、頓成嚴重問題、西聯足球賽因此將提早結束、據西聯會傳出消息、業已證實昨東華對法商在逸園舉行之甲組聯賽、已爲最後一幕、所有各隊名次、將依照第一循環計算、其他預備及乙丙各組、亦趕於兩星期內完畢、盃賽方面、僅餘初級盃決賽一塲、則將於星期四（廿三）解決、名次既依照第一循環成績推算、則東華之亞軍寶座、已可穩得、昨賽東華初頗佔取優勢、以二比一佔先、下半時則竟一瀉千里、總結以三對二慘敗、觀眾僅千餘人、</p>
<p>萬津首中　黃毛遲到、法商初僅十人應戰、法商先攻、各有來去、未見緊張、萬津吊中、阿戴士彥幼良、幾次擺渡、被阻角球、幼良開出阿戴頭攻、被老頭子雷蒙特接個正着、象華攻門、雖準乏力、雷蒙特又接出、接着萬津得舒士耕之傳射門又被接、十四分鍾時、阿賈傳戴、戴傳象華、象華立刻轉到萬津腳下、左腳起處、打中左角、清晰之至、</p>
<p>東華佔先　一比〇後、黃毛尚未見到、直至廿三分鍾時、始見姍姍來遲、東華攻勢依然旺盛、稍停、鮑休一腳打來、甚見兇猛、秦必高未曾接着、幸虧打在網外、阿賈士彥互相妙遞、又深入敵陣、挑送中央、距門不足七碼、阿載必中之　，竟然斜出、而雷蒙特亦心慌意亂、用手一撩、遂成角球、開出以後仙傑倫在廿碼處犯規、阿戴主踢任意球、未收效果、球被蔡聲森截獲、傳幼良、十五碼處、一腳猛打、果然中的、檢　時計正卅六分鍾、東華以二比〇佔得絕對優勢、法商乃改變陣勢、傑蘇與牛堡易位、於是黃毛一試五十碼之猛衝、幸秦必高失而復得、未閙倒戈、但四十二分鍾時華特於十二碼外一腳高挑、前半遂以二比一結束、</p>
<p>連失兩城　檸檬後、秦必高接傑姆之射、黃毛第二次試演猛衝、秦未免心慌、竟然失手、連拍帶跑、雖告出險、但軍心未免受到影響、沈戴賈一次美妙之運輸、阿戴打門、老頭子又救出、十九分鍾時、莊友仁一腳反勾、竟成失足、於是鮑休衝過、三碼處一腳橫掃秦必高眼看入門、無法挽救、二比二打成平手、以後東華險象迭生、但前鋒綫未爲所餒、依然有銳利之攻門、卅分鍾時、鮑休美妙兇射、秦必高撲成角球、蒙諾脫開出、傑姆一腳中鵠、三比二法商反敗爲勝矣、四十分鍾時、莊友仁衝出傳蔡、立刻轉萬津、前無敵衛、機會再好不過、可惜一觸太遠、竟然無人接應、於是東華在可勝之局面下、反遭敗績、深堪惋惜也、</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>今之婚後生活而不得女性之愛者，必缺乏男子固有之情味。及有生理上的缺點所致，特別是喪失生殖一端，最爲重要，蓋夫婦之關係，夫愛其妻，妻受夫之愛，因此兩者之調和，而家庭遂得保持和平與幸福，雖然，妻對於夫，固爲消極之被愛者，而一旦爲母，則立反其道，爲積極之愛人者，蓋其兒較其自身更爲弱者劣者也，故此時之女性，一身而兼具兩資格，對於其夫，爲消極之被愛者。對於其子，則爲積極之愛人者，甚至推而增愛其夫，故夫婦之愛雖因時日漸久，或有倦怠之感，然一有愛的結晶，則妻仍能以柔情蜜意維持家庭的和平。人稱女子爲生於愛死於愛者，誠非偶然也。從此點以觀察，則婚前自凟與婚後縱慾的人，每喪失生殖的機能，既不能被愛於要，又不能生殖子嗣，陷妻子之生活如沙漠之寂寞，卒致感情破裂幸福全無！</p>
<p>照生理學上論斷，子嗣的有無，須診察其生殖機能有否患病，蓋生殖機能若罹疾病，則不僅早洩陰痿逐一爆發，且患者的壽命亦岌岌可危，惟依余多年來治療上述各症的經騐所知，本症若能積極施用青春腺素製劑治之，每能着手回春，如德國梅倫博士所發明之真正雄壯動物青春腺素製劑男用「補體康」即根據上述原理而製成，故服後生殖機能復歸健全，頭腦即感覺特別清爽，精神即振奮異常，所有以前之陰痿早洩，神經衰弱，發育不全等症澈底掃除，故爲中外醫家所讚譽，樂願推荐於病家，「補體康」因何會具此回春效果？實由該劑之主要成分採自動物之睪丸精質，以動物之睪丸精質以補人體精質的不足，無怪有顯著的效力，並滲入補腦之燐質，故能補腦健神，惟在購取時，必須指明此種藥劑，蓋雜牌乃無此種偉大藥力也。</p>
<p>至於其女用「補體康」，爲卵巢內分泌劑之最佳者，凡月經不調，乳癟失健，婚後不孕，及有不感症的現象者，服後即可根治。</p>

<p>— （美國醫學博士黃仲昌撰）</p>
<p>根除淋菌爲肅清淋毒的先決問題</p>
<p>以何藥始可負起此種驅淋大責任？</p>
<p>要研究根本剷除淋病的方法，首先要瞭解淋病的病原菌的生活，關於這一層，德國淋病學大師彼德博士最有心得。他費去三十餘年的心血，最後始發明用蛋白體黃色素等混合製成「克淋儂」一藥，此藥之特點，是服後能於最短期內，發生一種抗淋噬菌作用，即很迅速地由血液直達病灶，將所有的淋菌，包圍殲滅之，使狡猾的淋菌，無所逃遁，所以淋病患者不論初起或誤服市上一般劣藥，致變成凶惡的症狀，都可服德國「克淋儂」以挽救之。確可在四五星期內徹底根治。</p>
<p>當「克淋儂」未發明以前，各國政府，都揭起撲滅淋菌的旗號，向世界宣揚，可是語其成績，十九都是失敗，雖重賞之下，仍無勇夫，可是歐西人士，經了本國政府這樣的鼓勵提倡，各醫學家無不埋首孜孜研究，而德國淋病學者彼德博士研究所得，尤爲驚人，因「克淋儂」有了上述的作用，淋菌當然再沒有反抗的能力。只有整個被「克淋儂」所降伏，而徹底消滅。此實爲治療淋病上亙古未有的奇蹟，較之時下一般化學療法，及透膜殺菌療法，與夫檀香油　澄茄等製劑者，大異其趣，因爲此等成藥，藥性霸烈，副作用甚大。得不償失，故各國政府紛紛以鉅額獎金，給予彼德博士，以酬其發明之勞。凡一切淋病，如不服「克淋儂」休息獲到根本治癒的希望。在外用藥方面男子可外用「抗淋水」女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，均可按圖與說明書在家自行治療，尤騐。</p>

<p>後尿道之軟性浸潤，據奧倍魯氏之見解，謂淋毒性之後尿道軟性浸潤，多由於尿酸，燐酸鹽之尿沈滓，或房事過多，又因過度之手淫而來。他如又時見併發於素有生殖器結核性的患者。此外更有膀胱無力症Atonie　der　Biase,遺留尿Bestbarn等所見之易於出血的粘膜加答兒，外括約筋過勞而發生。就炎症之分布而言，則內括約筋周圍地方的攝護腺部，均被炎症所侵入，然而接近炎症侵入門戶之部分，以膜狀部份爲最。此種情形，如果用尿道鏡檢查，即可完全明療，故醫家不可不爲之十分注意也。</p>
<p>對於後尿道一症，其將來病患之變動，往往不能逆料。所以醫家對於淋毒性後尿道之軟性滑潤，必須迅速之根治，因此種粘膜之浸潤，每有使尿道粘膜互相粘合，反而釀成尿道閉塞狹窄，而有尿中毒之危險。故非作徹底治療不可。余用德國靜電療法，及X線療法，一方內服淋病聖藥「克淋儂」爲內服藥，使其體內發生抗淋噬菌作用，此藥爲舉世一鎮痛，收歛浸潤粘膜恢復固有之健康。如此，則不僅炎症得以完全根除，而可怕之淋毒其他變症，亦自然而然的根治。因爲後尿道之軟性浸潤，其變症中有使精早發生腫大，而於生殖力上，有絕大妨害。但如今有此等療法，自可避免矣</p>

<p>— 張肖梅</p>
<p>張肖梅博士，係中外聞名之經濟學家，歷任中國銀行經濟研究室主任，並主辦中國國民經濟研究所，最近籌備成立之國立西南經濟研究所副主任一席，聞亦已聘定張博士担任。該篇係張博士新編「中外經濟年報」中之一章，該報由中國國民經濟研究所出版，定三月二十五日發售，承張博士先賜本刊發表，無任感幸，希讀者注意。　編者</p>
<p>（一）現代戰爭之成敗關鍵</p>
<p>一九一四年世界大戰，德國獨擋一面，轉戰四年，終於敗績；非前綫之不利，乃後方之不濟。名將魯屯道夫，本大戰經騐，倡全民戰爭論；以爲現代戰爭，無前後方之分；勝負所決，不在軍備之多寡，而在全國資源之厚薄。蓋已不限於雙方軍隊之交鋒，而爲兩大民族之鬥爭矣。</p>
<p>古云「勝負乃兵家常事」今日尤信；夫以一時之得失，殊不足爲決勝之關鍵，戰爭之持久，至於最後勝利，實繫於全國上下之堅韌，整個國民經濟之鞏固；尤以後者爲長期抗戰物質上之先決條件。</p>
<p>抑又進者，現代國際關係，錯綜複雜；兩國間之糾紛，輒足以啟有關係之第三國乃至整個世界之利害衝突。尤以素稱次殖民地之中國，向爲列強角逐之戰塲；日本對華戰爭，無疑爲排斥歐美在遠東之勢力，封鎖中國門戶，俾其獨自享受，故自九一八事變以來，中日糾紛，早成國際政治舞臺上之重頭演出。自七七事變演成八一三大戰，列強間雖因種種關係，未有積極之表演，但精神與物質上之對華同情與援助，已發生相當作用。尤以自日人獨吞中國之野心漸爲世人洞察後之今日，更不能長此坐視，如英美今已先後對日提出強硬牒文，並毅然由對華精神上之同情，進而爲物質上之援助；我國爲獨立生存而奮戰，又有數百倍於日本之全國資源爲後盾；國外資源之獲得與否，固不足以左右我抗戰之決心與操勝之實力；惟戰時之能獲得國外資源，究能使抗戰實力益見充實，何況我國產業落後，現代軍需工業又無基礎可言，故爭取海外資源，亦爲抗戰偉業上不可或缺之程序·歐戰以美國之參戰而結束，表面上雖以協約國有此生力軍之加入而乃得擊潰疲敝之德軍，實質在於德國之貧乏資源，因此而更不能利用海外資源之彌補，以致促其迅速崩潰故耳。</p>
<p>吾政府有鑑於此，故戰爭之初，即下令穩定金融，一方從事工業內遷，提倡工業合作運動，建設西南；啟發資源，整頓國內經濟。一方維持債信，承認門戶開放原則，表示歡迎外資，努力與友邦經濟上之合作，今抗戰一年有半，幣制穩固，經濟安定，各國與論一致讚許者，良有以也。</p>
<p>（二）抵制侵略之國際的展開</p>
<p>夫抵制侵略，固在吾人堅決抗戰，至於最後之勝利。友邦人士，若能本正義人道之宗旨，與侵略者以經濟制裁之措施；則其爲力，事半功倍，已知前述。故三八年初，比京之中國代表團發表抵制日本對華侵略之經濟條件如次</p>
<p>（一）禁止供給日本軍需或工業原料　因日本之軍需及工業原料，大部仰給國外；若各國停止供給，即限於少數主要項目，亦必與以嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>（二）抵制日貨與日船　日本國際收支，端賴工業品出口及其航運收入，以爲平衡；若各國抵制日貨及日船，則不徒可致其工業於死命，且將破壞其整個國民經濟。</p>
<p>（三）拒絕對日信用　日本戰費浩大，國內資源有限，非有外國信用，則自顧將不足，更何暇發展侵略之所得；若各國拒絕信用，不但使之不能和中日·日俄兩戰之獲利，且可以加強一·二兩點之效力。</p>
<p>（四）相當少數國家之經濟措施　因日本原料信用之供給及其出口品之市塲無集中於少數國家，此少數國家，包括美·英帝國·法及安南·荷及東印度·比利時等。若與日經濟絕交，則日本即將如魚失水，無可活躍。</p>
<p>（五）援助中國　所以加強中國抗戰能力，抵制國際侵略勢力，則　愛好和平國家，亟宜擴展對華協助，廣行軍需及財政之接濟。</p>
<p>另一方面，三八年二月初國聯執委會通過援助中國案，重申上屆大會決議；請各國分別盡力援助中國。同時國際和平運動，於倫敦召開國際抵制大會，到二十國代表，一致通過抵制案；嚴懲侵略行爲，嗣又於巴黎召集國際和平運動大會，一致反對日本濫殺無辜人民，決議抵制日貨，停止軍需供給，鼓勵對華放款，並決議以倫敦之援華總會爲國際援華運動之總樞紐；自同年十月起，該會且每月發行國際援華通信一次，藉以溝通及促進各地援華工作之展開，現由此等國際和平團體所支持之國際援華工作，大致已循下列三大路綫而前進：（一）督促各國政府，實施國聯對日制裁之決議案？（二）擴大抵制日貨運動，（三）捐款，捐藥品及衣物，救濟中國傷兵及難民。</p>
<p>（三）我國經濟外交之成就</p>
<p>前述援華工作，都係世界公正人士自動舉行，且皆以民間團體之形式而付之實施，不能視爲我國經濟外交之收獲。其由我國政府所策動，而可視爲經濟外交工作者，厥維爭取各國對華之財政援助是，目前各國中，最能與吾同情而又舉足輕重者，自推英美法三大民主國家。茲分別述之。</p>
<p>中美　中美居太平洋兩岸，素稱友善，自華盛頓會議簽訂九國公約之後，益臻敦睦。當九一八事變發生，前國務卿史汀生曾力持正義，奔走呼籲，卒至國聊通過不承認案。三七年中日戰爭爆發，國人仰望於美國者甚深。美國與論，雖有孤立派及絕對和平主義者之存在，然大抵斥責侵略，同情抗戰。尤其目光稍遠，如史汀生氏，及上海萬國教堂牧師羅高克Emory　Luccock　D.D.等，更一致提醒中日戰軍中美國之道德責任，主張有所積極行爲。著名遠東評論家文弗爾Nathaniel　Pfeffer，觀中國抗戰一年之結果，亦變更其孤立主義之原來立塲，而倡議美人應與侵略國不合作：「不買（日貨）不賣（軍需）不借（信用）」；同時又與不侵略國合作；予以各種便利）·美國與論之對華同情，由此可見</p>
<p>戰後中美經濟關係之可注意者，一爲白銀問題，一爲信用問題。</p>
<p>一九三四年美國開始購銀政策，抬高銀價，寢至中國無法維持銀本位制，於三五年十一月宣布停止銀本位，採用管理滙兌制。三六年春，我國銀行家陳光甫氏銜命聘美，與美財長茅根韜訂立白銀協定，美國按白銀每啢值美金四角五分購取華銀五千萬啢。</p>
<p>三七年七月，第一屆中美協定滿期，其時孔財長出席英皇加冕盛典後便道遊美，乃續訂白銀協定，以銀易金，作吾國滙兌準備及出口信用担保之用。</p>
<p>三八年七月，協定又屆期滿：是月下旬，日方散佈謠言，謂英國有將中國金貨準備改作國際共管之說。經美財長正式宣言，美國購買華銀協定，業已展期；條件大抵如舊。</p>
<p>據花旗銀行月刊八月號所載：二八年五月，中政府曾請美政府續購白銀，協助穩定中美貨幣關係，雙方即成立轉期協定，約以中國白銀交換美元信用或黃金。三八年上半期，華銀運至紐約者計一億四千萬兩，值美金六千三百萬元。自三七年十月起，共計運銀一億九千萬啢，值美金八千四百萬元。自一九三四年以來，美國購買中國白銀前後共達三億啢之譜，所得售價，一部分標出黃金，一部分作爲銀行存款。此爲美國對華貨幣合作之一班。</p>
<p>然戰爭之破壞無限，故非力事建設，啟發資源，不足以談長期之抗戰，更　論戰後之復興。自有利用國外信用之必要。</p>
<p>三八年九月下旬，中國使節團抵美，仍由銀行鉅子陳光甫先生統領。一方與美實業界商談軍需供給及信用，一方與美政府作借款商榷。</p>
<p>十月二十日，美財部宣言與中國使節團之商榷已有進步。</p>
<p>十二月十六日，中美二千五百萬美元之借款告成，同時又有成立中英借款之喜訊。此項信用，五年爲期，純屬商業性質，大部將用於購買卡車及汽油云。　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c37">英國金準備 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— The　Economist.　No.　4976　陳寶鎔譯</p>
<p>自歐局動盪以來，倫敦在世界金融上之地位，亦隨政治地位之貶跌而下降；英鎊制霸世界之時代，幾已成過去之史跡：從而英政府之保有金，在英鎊掙扎中不斷損失，隨而亦不斷下降，倫敦經濟雜誌對此亦直認不諱。惟就該誌記者對於南菲黃金存儲當地之報道，可知英鎊之基礎，尚不如一般人意想中之惡劣；該誌記者倡議重估英蘭銀行金準備之主張，現已實施；且其對於英鎊前途之繫於歐洲政局，而今又見其反應：承陳先生譯賜本刊，至爲感幸，凡關心英金者，希注意之。　編者</p>
<p>存金銳減　最近之英國匯兌平衡基金，據去年十二月三十一日公佈者如下：（每啢以一四〇先令計算）（單位：百萬鎊）</p>
<p>一九三七年　一九三八年</p>
<p>三月三十一日　九月三十日　三月卅一日　九月三十日</p>
<p>英格蘭銀行　五一六·六　五三七六　五三七·六　五三七·六</p>
<p>滙兌平衡基金　一八六·九　二七九·三　二九七·八　一五一·八</p>
<p>總計　七〇三·五　八一六·九　八三五·四　六八九·四</p>
<p>據此，英格蘭銀行金準備，始終穩定：而匯兌平衡基金在四至九月間，竟損失黃金一四六百萬鎊。一九三八年十月二十二日出版的「經濟學者雜誌」，曾估計英國匯兌基金因受法國存英黃金提取回國的影響，五月底至少損失六五百萬鎊；其後八·九兩個恐慌月份中，又須陸續流出黃金一〇〇百萬鎊；故預計九月三十日止，滙兌平衡基金至多僅存一三〇百萬鎊。觀今日之官報始知當初之預料，過於悲觀。雖然：預計與實數僅差二二百萬鎊，似尚可原諒。</p>
<p>設立外庫乎　去年初從南菲運到英國的黃金，平均每週一·五百萬鎊，但九月八日與十五日，忽由一，〇五四，〇〇〇鎊降至三五三，〇〇〇鎊，至今猶未復原。然南菲至今並未停止採金，因此可知黃金滯留南菲之原因，恐由英國當局之指使。在此戰雲彌漫之日，爲安全起見，將一部份金準備保存在自己領土內，確是好法子。</p>
<p>最近存金估計　自此項官方報告公佈以來，又越三月。在此三個月中，當然仍有大量黃金從英國流出。今以九月三十日滙兌平衡基金一五二百萬做起點，推測九月三十日以後黃金流出之情形爲何如。試先看英國生金進出口現狀：（單位：千鎊）</p>
<p>一九三八年十月至十二月</p>
<p>進口　出口</p>
<p>由法國　一四·〇二八　至美國　一〇二·九八四</p>
<p>比利士　八·三四〇　加拿大　三·二八〇</p>
<p>嗬囒　三·七五二　比利士　一·九一〇</p>
<p>德國　二·五七〇　Eire　一·〇一〇</p>
<p>南菲　一·八五六　瑞典　九七八</p>
<p>西菲　一·六六八　瑞士　六〇八</p>
<p>瑞士　一·六一〇　其他　三八六</p>
<p>印度　一·四六九</p>
<p>其他　二·三〇四</p>
<p>總計　三七·五九七　總計　一一一·一五六</p>
<p>照上表看來，黃金出口凈數爲七三，五五九，〇〇鎊，但尚有斟酌之處。第一，比利士在十月六日以前一週中，有黃金七，六六一，〇〇〇鎊運至英國，但此係比國政府爲了安全起見寄存倫敦者，故其所有權並不變更。反之，運比之一，九一〇，〇〇〇鎊，其中有否避難金在內，則成疑問。如以此爲比利士人的定裁表示，則應將七，六六一，〇〇〇鎊從進口總數減去</p>
<p>其次，南菲運來黃金僅一，八五六，〇〇〇鎊，如以每星期一·五百萬鎊計算，應有一九，五〇〇，〇〇〇鎊。可見三個月中有一七，六〇〇，〇〇〇鎊留存於南菲的英國特別指定項下。此外運往加拿大的黃金，或許有一部份係英國當局爲求安全而運去，惟爲數若干無從得知</p>
<p>依此，黃金出口數可修改爲：（百萬鎊）</p>
<p>報告上的凈出口數　七三·六</p>
<p>加比利士避難金的進口數　七·七</p>
<p>合計　八一·三</p>
<p>減去在南菲及加拿大指定項下的估計數　一八·三</p>
<p>滙兌平衡基金的凈損失數　六三·〇</p>
<p>僅此六三百萬鎊，尚不能窺其全豹，倫敦生金市塲之定裁購買，已可抵償此數，因定裁包括黃金進口在內。然窖藏購買所造成之情形適反，查最後三月中生金市塲的經過，自准許轉賣後，匯兌基金所供給窖藏的黃金，已達五百萬鎊。此外又受法國黃金之提回影響，據Reynaud氏估計爲三四百萬鎊，至年底將達五〇或六〇百萬鎊。但其中由倫敦運出者佔三〇百萬鎊</p>
<p>法國統制局今日雖已購買金鎊，但黃金由倫敦注入巴黎者，至今尚無紀錄。或謂此項金鎊已變爲美元，並已流入紐約。此固在意料之中，惟英國黃金轉入法國指定項下者，最多恐亦不超出五百萬鎊。再加最後三月份之滙兌損失，以七三百萬鎊計，則一九三八年十二月三十一日之英國滙兌基金已僅存黃金八〇百萬鎊。（以整數計算）</p>
<p>如依目前市價每啢一五〇先令計，則八〇百萬鎊計實可值八六百萬鎊，因此可加強平準外滙之技術地位。「秋季危機」今已過去，大部份「熱資」存於倫敦者，業已相繼流出。預料美元亦將買空，故其價必漲，於是一般投機者或將轉而需要英鎊，加以年底美元的清理，使匯兌基金有若干美元或指定黃金存於美國，此不啻爲隱藏準備，並可向英蘭銀行收回一九三六年底所賣與滙兌基金之黃金。最近，信託紙幣發行數將收回三〇百萬鎊，從銀行發行部提出三〇百萬鎊的黃金，則其金準備將減少此數，但匯兌基金即以三〇百萬鎊的有價證券給與銀行。當此次黃金轉入滙兌基金時，可抬高至五三百萬鎊，每啢以一五〇先令計算。所以滙兌基金的金準備將恢復一三九百萬鎊之數。如以後政治上無甚糾葛，則英鎊的技術地位，足以應付一般需要矣。</p>
<h3 id="c38">戰時上海金融市塲（續） <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 朱博泉</p>
<p>（六）現金市塲之復活　上海標金市塲，本爲投機者活動之所。以前每月成交數，常達三四百萬條，幣制改革後，即告冷落，每月成交數不過四五千條，滬戰發生後，即完全停止。我國幣制，原以白銀爲本位，自法幣政策實行，已成爲管理通貨。對外滙價，與世界金銀價格之變遷，早已失其聯繫。乃自上年三月政府實施外滙統制後，投機者又復利用世界金銀比價之變動，從中操縱；於是上海非公開市塲之現金交易，頓形活躍。上年五月後上海現金價，受倫敦市塲之影響，即起漲風，六月中漲至二千元，（十兩標準金價）一度回軟，旋又重漲，十一月間曾達二千零六十八元。本年三月初，因現金籌碼缺乏，加以華北方面之收買，一度竟創二千二百元之高價，目下仍盤旋於二千一百元左右。與戰前比較，已漲起一千元左右。現金市塲雖可影響一部份黃金之移動，然因我國外滙基礎，已臻穩定，中美白銀協定上年亦已展期，於整個金融，似無若何影響。</p>
<p>（七）票據交換之變動　上海之票據交換，分爲華商銀行錢莊及外商銀行等三組。華商銀行之票據交換所，成立於一九三三年一月，由銀行業聯合準備會主辦，其交換手續，與歐美各國相仿，錢莊亦有匯劃總會之組織，惟其交換方法甚爲陳舊，至外灘銀行（包括外商銀行及中中交三行在內）間之票據收解，則僅有軋賬方法，並無交換所之組織與制度。</p>
<p>銀行票據交換所，戰前每日於下午一時及三時三十分舉行交換二次，戰後因票據減少，改爲每日下午三時一次。一九三七年一月至七月，該所每日平均交換數，計二千九百餘萬元，八月至十二月每日平均僅七百萬元，約爲四與一之比。一九三八年一月至七月，每日平均數僅六百餘萬元，八月至十二月稍有起色，每日平均約九百萬元。戰後各月交換數額，以一九三七年十二月份及一九三八年十二月份爲最低，每日平均僅得三百六十萬元。惟近來交換數額，已逐漸遞增，今年一月份，每日平均交換數已達二千四百餘萬元，幾與戰前每日平均數不相上下，足見在特殊環境下上海之商業交易，已漸有活潑之趨勢。</p>
<p>錢莊之票據交換，向稱軋公車，其每日之公單收解數，係包括同業拆款轉帳之數在內，與銀行之票據交換數字，性質不同，頗難比較，惟一般觀察，戰後錢莊之公單收解數，與銀行票據交換數之上落，其趨勢亦正相同。至錢業之票據收解方法，戰後已略有改進，向來由各莊派老司務分頭收票者，現已改由各莊派交換員二人於每日下午一時至二時至滙劃總會集中辦理。又錢莊同業軋帳之公單，向來規定滿五百元者打大公單，不滿五百元及零數打小公單，每日向錢業準備庫軋清，上年十一月間經錢業公會決議，將大小名稱取消，不論數目多寡，均打一紙公單，每日軋清，手續已簡便。</p>
<p>至於外攤銀行之票據收解手續，向來於彼此送騐票據以後，均用大劃條由中國銀行爲總滙劃，每日互相結出差額後，用寄庫或解現方法了結，初無交換所之組織。自戰事發生後，已放棄其向所採用之大劃條辦法，改由各行每日派員於上午十一時半在滙豐銀行集中核對。又洋商銀行對於華商銀行向無存欠往來，戰後　收解便利起見，洋商銀行既破例向我中央銀行開立往來戶，中央銀行亦向洋商銀行開戶往來，由此華洋銀行間每日應收應解票據，互相委託代收，在往來戶內轉帳，較前便利不少。</p>
<p>金融業之狀況　戰事發生以來，上海金融業所處環境，逈異尋常。除外商銀行暫　不論外，就華商銀錢業言：自前年七月蘆溝橋變起，即有提存風潮，在滬戰爆發之前一個月中，各行莊存款，顯見減退。滬戰既起，銀錢業停業四天，政府頒布安定金融辦法後，人心始稍安定，存款遂無大量之減退。迨後戰區擴大，各地富有者紛紛携資來滬避難，於是各行莊存款，漸有增加趨勢，惟此種增加之存款，當以活期存款居多，在銀錢業方面，自不能不厚集準備，以資應府。</p>
<p>戰後各行莊營業方針，力求穩健，對於各種放款，頗爲謹慎，大都縮小營業範圍，衹收不放。幸而銀錢業之一部份押戶，在戰事中遭受損失者，最近因受上海物價高漲之利益，在彌　戰事損失外，尚有盈餘，故銀錢業戰前放款，除在戰期中停止營業之客戶外，往往可以如期收回。又各銀行業務，除一部份放款外滙等業務，戰後雖不免陷於停頓，而其他如保管倉庫房地產信託等業務，較之戰前反有增加之勢者，此種畸形發展，爲目下上海特殊環境下僅有之現象，其不能持久，自不待言。</p>
<p>在戰期中銀錢業資產上之損失，自屬難免，幸各行莊，平時大都營業穩健，準備充實，以前盈餘，抵補目下之損失，綽乎有餘。衹有極少數範圍較小之銀行，受戰事之打擊，聞有周轉不靈之苦。至於因此而倒閉者，則僅有一家銀行。同時在戰事發生前一月停業之四家銀行中，已有二家在上年先後復業。</p>
<p>中中交農四行，爲國內最大之政府銀行，在金融界有卓越之勢力，其總行原設在上海，滬戰發生後，此四家政府銀行，已將其總行移入內地，並在西南各省及香港等處分設機關，上海之金融勢力，已趨分散。目下上海各銀行，其平時運用資金之途徑與對象，在戰後均有壅塞減少之感，又因政府對於內地農鑛工商事業之開發，積極提倡，獎勵投資，因此滬市一般商業銀行，已有改向內地發展之趨勢，近來各銀行在川滇黔桂諸省設立分支行者，已有不少，金融重心，已有移轉之傾向，前途發展，殊堪注意。</p>

<p>— 育才</p>
<p>上海現在還有十萬難民，這十萬難民，都靠了難民救濟協會的努力勸募，把捐款來維持生活，現在差不多沒有一個人不知道難民救濟協會，不在感激難民救濟協會。但是會的本身能成功嗎？不能成功的，會是空洞的，他的所以能夠成功，完全靠全上海各界人士的熱心捐助，要全上海的人們，大眾一心一德，有錢出錢，有力出力，共同關心着難胞們的生活，這樣會才能成功。我們看看報紙上協會公佈的收支報告，就能知道捐款的數目實在是相當的可觀，但是委實因爲要救濟的人太多，所以分配起來，倒也並不寬裕，來日方長，何以為繼？這是一個問題，難民們個個都是我們親愛的同胞，我們誰都應該起來，負起責任，爲他們解決生活上的難題。</p>
<p>四月四日是兒童節，一年一度的，今年已是第八屆了，過去每年的兒童節，必有盛大的慶祝，今年的兒童節，亦已由各兒童教育團體在發起籌備，個人以爲慶祝儀式不妨簡單，但是要趁此時機，儘量宣傳兒童節約並推進一分救難運動。說到此地，不免有人要誤會，學校裏面的捐款實在太繁重了，一會兒要一元錢的樂善捐，一會兒要節約救難捐，一會兒又要什麼一分救難捐了，兒童粉撲兒長們經濟，都很平常，那有這許多餘款？這話表面看來，似乎很不錯的樣子，其實仔細分析一下是錯了，一元錢的樂善捐衹是一次，這是作爲難胞們的生產教育基金用的，而且只並非一定強迫要捐，全上海的大中小補各級學校學生總數約在三十萬以上，目標却衹定了十萬元，這裏面就是預算有一部份較貧苦者可以免捐，而況現在已是結果，以後不會有捐一元錢的樂善捐了。節約救難捐和一分救難捐呢，兩樣是一而二二而一的，不過一分救難捐較爲具體而已。兒童人每天節省一錢，實在說來，並不是件頂困難的事，我們只要看看有許多學校裏面消費合作社的營業情形，就很可以看出兒童們儘有負担一分捐的能力，每人每天捐一分，每月便是三角，想起了上次市民組發起募集領養難民捐款，知道每月捐二元，便能救濟一人一月的生活費用，豈不是兩個兒童就能救濟一個難民了嗎？「聚沙成塔集腋成裘」，這是絕對不錯的，看看不過一分錢，但是效用確很大，全上海的兒童們，我相信你們都是熱心的，從今天起，實行一分捐運動，十萬個難民們，他們正在熱烈地期望着你們呢。</p>

<p>— 第十報童學校　袁祥生</p>
<p>拿了報紙，怱怱趕到康腦脫路小沙渡路公共汽車站頭上喚賣，那時有許多上寫字間的先生去辦公，所以生意尚稱不惡，不過有時難免有買不掉的遭遇，在快賣完的時候，自己就得將報紙送到定戶的家裏，腳下絲毫不容你貪懶，報販們最感惱恨的，莫過於落雨天，有時離家的時候，氣侯很好，不幸拿到了報紙喚賣的當兒，下起陣陣的大雨，雨傘又沒有帶，爲了恐怕報紙受到雨點的侵濕，解除身上鈕扣，把它放在胸懷中，無情的雨點陣陣的打來，遍身都是濕淋淋地，怪難受的，瘦弱的身體，說不定會因此感受風寒而生病，雨天的馬路，如果走得快一些，確有滑跌的危險，因此而遲延送報的時間也難免了，遇着好的定戶，却也不說什麼，不過有一般心急的先生們，就要責問爲什麼將報紙這麼晏送來，他們那能知道其中理由及有幾個報館出版晚的緣故，真的，有時候報館裏爲了等侯消息，或是別的關係，直到很遲才出版，這就苦了報販們了，非但在路上如賽跑似地奔着，並且還要受那定戶的責備，所以我覺得各報館裏能將報紙在七點鍾之前出版才好，因爲我們將報紙遲送，有的定戶不明其中原由，以爲是報販們貪懶，而我們因爲時間侷促的關係，也無暇來作一個詳細的解說，衹得含糊地說聲明天早些送來了事。</p>
<p>每天將各定戶人家報紙送完，腳才可以得着休息的機會，整個早晨就在這怱忙中過去，也可以說過了一天的報販生活。</p>
<p>但亦有連帶賣那晚報的，這當然能多掙些錢，但肉體上就要更勞苦，人口多的報販們，要維持家庭生活，就不得不辛苦一些了。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c93">談談捷克 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 反省</p>
<p>捷克立國到現在，計算起來，有二十年的歷史，當第一次歐洲大戰時，捷克由於馬賽里克領導，及全國人民之奮勇鬥爭，而造成了今日捷克之地位，實在不易，二十年來努力之結果，捷克也能稱爲強國，而其工業發達，兵工精美，尤爲世界所稱道，所以一提到捷克，人們即聯想到他的出品，其普遍情形，可想而知了。</p>
<p>捷克全國人口，有一千四百萬，土地有十四萬公里，是一個很小的國家，其位置適處於德，匈，波，羅，等國當中，一面與強鄰德國接壤一面與匈牙利羅馬尼亞波蘭等國爲鄰，以是捷克的繁榮，本可增長弱小民族之勇氣。但遭受強鄰的嫉視自是不可避免之事，當德意二國想盡方法在歐洲伸張勢力的時候，捷克早已被認爲一塊肥肉了，除去年爲德，匈，波蘭，等國割去許多土地而外，現在又爲斯洛伐克省與喀爾巴阡烏克蘭省宣佈獨立問題，引起瓦解，其餘波希米亞摩拉維亞二省，又被德國乘機進佔，於是捷克山河破碎，陷於淪亡了。</p>
<p>此次事變，起於斯拉夫民族與捷克本族之紛爭，捷克之斯洛伐克省內住有斯拉夫民族很多，該族與兵人生活習慣，格格不入，常常發生衝突，當德國吞併蘇台德以後，更幫助斯族在捷國境內作獨立運動，想先將斯省喀省成爲德國的附庸，繼續舖平東進的道路而向蘇聯進攻，豈知事實有出入意料之外，捷克除在德國壓力之下，任斯洛伐克省喀爾巴阡省獨立，更將波摩二省求德國保護，以是波摩二省，當即任德國大軍長驅直入，宣告解體，消息傳來，舉世爲之震驚。</p>
<p>捷克是淪亡了，但捷克之淪亡，不發一槍，不費一彈，令人爲之悲慘，我們認爲捷克之亡，亡於英法，因爲英法政府一再因循縱容侵略，圖一時這茍安，陷捷克於不復，固不僅助長法西氣焰，亦且引火燒身，損人不利已，真是遺憾。但捷克本身亦有其咎，不能堅持自己立塲，徒賴他人調解，倘捷克四強會議之前，以主動的勢力，振作精神，團結人民，拚死一戰，則其結果未必陷於亡國。即不幸戰敗而亡，亦有相當代價，比較現在之忍氣吞聲局面，當有聲色，而況戰亦可以不亡麼？</p>
<p>科學實驗</p>
<h3 id="c94">一個有趣的玩具 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 曉紅</p>
<p>現在讓我來介紹一個有趣的玩具，這玩具並不是我的創造。乃是從書本上摘錄下來的，但是這玩具是與光學有關，明白了其中的奧妙，即可以知道光綫與視覺的奧妙雖是不關重要的小事，不過是一個玩具而已，但其中却含有科學的真理。讀者不妨細心研究着。</p>
<p>剪取一小圓片硬紙，約二寸闊三寸長，兩面各繪一個物體，例如紙的前面繪一隻鳥籠，背後繪一隻鳥，然後再在圓紙的兩邊，各繫一根綫即得。現在用手指撚綫，使圓紙急速旋轉，則鳥就見於籠中，（見圖）這種實騐，非常有趣，學生若有興緻，照此實行，不獨可以當作玩具，且可引起學生研究興趣。說來也很奇怪吧，明明是一邊是鳥，一邊是籠，兩不相關的東西，經過幾度運動，鳥會鑽入籠中，豈非異事。然若研究其理，則不難發見其科學的奧妙，因爲我人平常用目看物時，物像就映到我們眼球的網膜上。此時忽突然把物移去，物像並不立刻消失，却能暫時保留在網膜上，，這種現象，科學上呌做「留影」。剛才紙在轉動時，留在我們網膜上的籠像，還沒有來得及消失，跟後鳥像立刻又映到網膜上來，所以結果，兩相疊併，而我們看得好像鳥在籠中了。</p>
<p>上面的實騐，讀者們現在可以知其大概了。這本來是很平凡的事情，一個普通的卡紙，如法畫出，再加以轉勸即行。而牠的理由却是利用我人眼球網膜的留影作用，得到繼續不斷的幻覺，這樣說來，似乎也沒有什麼希奇了，但不知科學家，往往在平凡的實騐當中，得到更高深的成就，這就是普通人所不能辦到的事情，普通人遇事都慢不經心，科學家却研究一個究竟，普通人明白一件事物，就算了事，科學家明白一件事物，還要悉心利用，即如上面的一個平凡的實騐，科學家却根據人們的眼球網膜的「留影」作用，而發明了電影，這樣說來，牠還是電影的始祖呢！</p>
<p>我們大家也許都看過電影吧，電影的轉動敏捷，牠能將軟片上許多固定的人像活動起來，這個理由，正如我們前面所說，由於不斷運動的關係，小鳥便入籠一樣，諸君試想想，當然不會兩樣吧：電影可算是現代最大的事業了，所投的資本的數目，和直接間接賴以爲生的人，統計起來，真使人咋舌。不但如此，電影的文化傳播效能，在現在，也可說是獨一無二的利器，牠能將事物畢真的在眼前活動，比我們死板的坐在教室內聽先生說教式的教授法，高明得多了。然而牠的起源却是上面所說的那個不值一笑的東西。</p>
<p>從此我們也可以知道我人日常生活所遇到的事物，應該細心體騐，加意研究，即是一件很小的不值一顧的事情，也應該研究，雖然我們不一定要成爲科學家或發明家，但研究事物，利用事物，諒也不是無益的吧，願讀者們勿以我言爲妄。</p>

<p>人家呌我「難民」，我自己也承認是個「難民」。</p>
<p>「難民」，不是一個恥辱的名詞，只因我的家鄉，被戰爭毀滅了，所以我也是連帶地爲國犧牲，做了難民；假使我的家鄉，幸而不在戰區，反而別地方戰區的同胞，逃到我的家鄉去，那，我非但不是難民，也許還是救濟難民的一份子呢！</p>
<p>話雖如此，然而我不能夠永遠靠同胞救濟，我必須學習生產技能，在有受教育機會的時候，用心讀書。因爲「難民」固然不是一個恥辱的名詞，但，一輩子做「難民」，却是可恥的！</p>

<p>— 張夢飛</p>
<p>侯黃橋畔血腥腥，想起了當年淚滿巾，可恨那明朝一個吳三桂，引狠入室不安寗，弄得來大好中華無凈土，山河變色起風雲，一輩人民遭蹂躪，可憐冤氣不能伸，獨有那嘉定一城曾抗戰，願將血肉去犧牲，爲首爲頭黃　耀，和着侯峒曾，都是明朝的大義民，二公素性多忠直，此身不願去降清，招勇士，集壯丁，大家情願守孤城，直待那清兵一旦臨城下，他們是出城抵抗勇無倫，殺得那多少清兵連呌苦，血流遍地命歸陰，義民此際聲威壯，喊一聲殺盡胡虜方肯停，當時節清兵敗退呼援去，頓刻間蜂擁而來圍困城。</p>
<p>（白）侯黃二先生，見着清兵復至，明知不能抵抗，他們便吩咐許多壯丁，將城門閉起，各各守在城頭，預備着擂木砲石短刀弓箭之類，等待他們來攻城，便將灰瓶砲石甩下，或者將亂箭射下，倘是爬上城來，衹須短刀削去他們的手足，所以韃子又死去不少。</p>
<p>（唱）一時韃子欲攻城，急切之間難進門，上面灰瓶並石砲，猶如雨點一般形，要將索子攀城齒，又被刀兒割斷繩，所以是徒然性命傷城下，眼看着城池堅固不能登，韃子是衹得望城興嗟歎，說道嘉定蠻人崛強成，不比其他懦弱性，毫無抵抗便歸心，故而是立時飛調大軍至，將四門水洩不通行，如此長期來圍困，早不料一月之間影響生，城內可憐糧精盡，勢難持久守城心，於是侯黃無計較，衹得毅然，向眾話衷情，說道眾位呀我們都是明朝漢，一等堂堂大國民，而今是痛遭亡國亡家慘，豈肯貪安一日生，國不存時家不在，亡國奴更比狗猪輕，可知道昔年元代稱天子，壓迫中原實痛心，常言道十家三韃來監督，切菜刀一把要幾家臨，倘是新婚花燭夜，新娘子先給韃子去尋開心，倘逢宴會佳時節，韃子應當首座尊，真所謂一切自由都剝盡，束縛如同枷鎖身，所以是我們不願來投順，願意今朝性命拚，於是眾人都奮勇，一聲喊殺啟城門，刀起處韃子頭覷隨地滾，槍挑處胡虜立刻命歸陰，眾人說殺一個，償還本，殺二個，即是賺一人，抵抗到底爲口號，身亡却不死精神，當時一眾義民盡赴義，頓然地暗與天昏，黃　耀，侯峒曾，義薄雲天喪了身，可歎城池便失去，一聲令下要屠城，韃子心腸多狠毒，三次屠城纔稱心，殺去人民知多少，積屍遍地臭難聞，無辜人民遭痛苦，見之慘目說傷心，到如今偶過候黃橋畔路，青松翠柏冷森森，真的是一代義民昭日月，名留千古史垂青。</p>

<h3 id="c98">讀報的門檻（一） <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 談天</p>
<p>和我認識的小老漢，只要有兩三日不見，一回碰到，照例他要問我一聲，先生「這幾天，報上出了什麼事麼」？於是我也照例把當天的新聞，和他大概的談幾句便走開了，但我仔細的想來，小老漢他也頗識得幾個字，國文的修養，也着實夠得上初中一年級的程度，而他常說看不懂報，不懂門檻，每次遇到我時，老是這麼問我「報上出了什麼事」？他的意思好像是報紙在出新聞。而不是社會出新聞，「蘆溝橋」「八一三」以及現在的一切的戰事新聞，都是報紙上發生的，而不是實際在我們周遭開展，這真是笑話！</p>
<p>可是像他這樣的人，每天爲了生活勞苦，雖識得幾個字而看不懂報的。不知有多少呢！況且，時事影響他們的生活太大了。比如他爲什麼不能在如戰前一樣做生意，而遭到失業，爲什麼有些人由前樓而搬到擱樓，爲什麼一般人爲現在的物價的高漲而擔憂呢？所有這些時事。都和他有直接關係，所以不由得他不關心時事。而常要問我，「報上出了什麼事哩」？唉現在的人，在這動亂的大時代，如果不明白目前時事，不要說失業，就是有事做的人，也非常重要，因爲報紙，不但告訴他未來的必要的社會現象，還可以指示他目前的實際的生活情形，一個人要知道謀生方法，做人的步驟，那麼他，就非看報不可！</p>
<p>話又說回來，一個普通的老百姓，就是國文基礎再好些，要想真正看懂一份報紙，可也不容易，國爲一，打開一份報紙滿眼都是新聞，篇幅倒有七八張，那些新聞重要，是必須要看的，那些新聞次要，是可以省去的。如果從頭到尾一字不漏又沒有這麼多的時間。一部廿四史不知如何着手，二，新闻的排版·式样新颖，各报馆争奇　勝·常常頭尾分開，長短不一，看起來既不如千文百姓那樣清楚，又沒有七俠五義那樣易懂，常常神龍見首不見尾，弄得莫名其妙·三，現在科學進步，文化發展，新名詞疊出不窮，有的來自物理學的，有的來自化學的，更有的來自政治經濟的，這些名詞。自然不是一般人所了解。四，現在的報紙，新聞來源，多有背景，且都是政府的宣傳機關，不一定都是站在老百姓地位來說話，替老百姓伸冤，和指導老百姓出路的，所以報紙上登載的消息，往往和事實大有出入，有時發生一件大事，各報的新聞也不同互見，比方說吧「九一八」事件。中國報紙說日本侵略中國的領土，想滅亡中國。獨霸亞洲，歐美報紙說日軍要妨害列強在華利益·行將引起列強間的第二次世界大戰，但日本報紙却說，要維持東亞和平。此種說法，與意大利侵略阿比西尼亞。在報紙上說阿比西尼亞是野蠻的國家，意國爲宣揚文明起見，所以不得不使阿國文明起來。由此看來·一件事有幾種說法。公說公有理，婆說婆有理，老百姓看來，難怪不懂其中的奧妙了。</p>
<p>我想「要使小老漢這樣的人，能自動看報，必須告訴他看報的門檻，使他們先懂得了門檻，然後各種困難問題自然會慢慢的解決，這是一個最好的辦法吧：不過我自己平日對於看報的門檻，並不如何精通，尤其是什麼新名詞呀，各國的政治經濟關係呀……等等，慚愧得很，有許多問題我自己也弄不清楚。（未完）</p>

<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞併入義大利，義王稱阿比西尼亞皇帝，英法諸國，起先都不承認，後來幾經曲折，就都先後承認了。墨索里尼的氣燄大增，於是積極援助弗朗哥，造成國民軍的勝利，果然，英法起先也是不承認國民軍政府的，現在也就承認了。</p>
<p>奧大利併入德國，英法爲了息事寗人計，承認惟恐不速。希特勒的氣燄也大增，於是處心積慮，謀定而後動，在幾天之前，又乾出了併吞波希米亞與摩拉維亞，而瓜分捷克的把戲。英法現在又玩着不承認這一套了，究竟這一套的壽命有多久，現在還不知道，看來也很短促罷。</p>
<p>推究起來，「不承認主義」的始創者，乃是美國史汀生。郡時我國的東北被侵略，史汀生潑有聯合英國出而干涉之意，英國不肯，史汀生乃宣言不承認武力造成的變局，以爲補救。這一個不承認，到現在還有效！</p>
<p>當然，有了各國的不承認，至少可以在道義上制裁侵略者，使侵略者有所顧忌，畏懼，不敢爲所欲爲，這是不承認主義的價值。然而一樣的不承認，爲什麼對於阿比醇正西尼亞，西班牙，奧地利，或者甚至捷克，都會失敗，而對於中國仍能見其效用呢？這沒有別的理由，第一，美國有維持道義的決心，而不爲強暴者的現實所左右，在她對中國沒有改變態度之先，別國還不敢冒天下的大韙，而擅自承認侵略者的惡勢力；第二，尤其重要的，我以爲就是我們的始終不屈服，抗戰到底，爲這主義作了堅強的後盾。</p>
<p>所以我可以說，「不承認主義」的本身，是有價值的；但是這價值的存在，還須主持正義的國家，肯始終維持着，更須被侵略的國家，力自爭氣，不辜負遵守此主義者的一片苦心。</p>
<p>捷克是完了，英法的宣言不承認，不過是一種解嘲。只有中國，還在抗戰着。不承認主義固然爲了中國事件而發起，而牠的價值却還須中國給牠維持。中國對於國際間一種正當主義，有此貢獻，中國也足以自豪了！</p>

<p>其實不然，藝術離不開人生，作品寄託於人格。繪畫，凋刻，音樂，無不如此，文學尤爲明顯。必也存於中，才能形於外；必也具有「不忍人」之心，才能寫出天地間的至文。韓愈說：「夫所謂文者，必有諸其中。是故，君子慎實，實之美惡，其發也不拚。」托爾斯泰直以藝術非「爲人生」不可，或更不限於藝術。他說：「一切的信實的職業的前提條件，不是對工作的愛，乃是對人類不得不愛。這工作在改善人類的信念之下對於工作非愛不可。惟這樣充實愛念者，乃得爲有價值的工作。」你想，只這一股愷悌慈祥之氣，忠貞熱烈之忱已足以照耀千古；而況副之以敏銳的眼光，超時代的見解，文藝上的技巧，發爲文章，自然有不可思議的力量。憑這力量，引起人類的共鳴；憑這力量，推動政治法律道德思想的改革；憑這力量，普救芸芸眾生於水深火熱之中。托爾斯泰之所以爲托爾斯泰者在此，同樣，高爾基之所以爲高爾基，羅曼羅蘭之所以爲羅曼羅蘭，孔丘之所以爲孔丘，畢翟之所以爲畢翟，韓愈之所以爲韓愈……也是在此·然後，知立言必基於立德，「藏之名山，傳之後世，」非可倖而致者。</p>
<p>藝術上最忌的是虛僞的表現，自己本不喝酒，偏要湊上幾首對酒，野飲，醉後書懷的詩歌；自己本極熱中，偏要彈盟　鷗訪漁樵的高調；自己胸腔裏滿是私慾邪念，偏要說擔道義拯萬民等門面話。「修詞不立其誠」，那里會有好文章呢！即使「著作等身」，也不過宇宙間暫時添加了許多魚目，許多碔砆，並不是珠玉，決不能傳後。</p>
<p>即使他的寫作的技巧，十分高明，可以掩盡天下人之目；但他的虛僞的人生，遲早總有被人揭破的一日，尤其在「歲寒」的當兒。一經揭破，則「言不由衷」的文章，「洛陽紙貴」的一剎那過去了，依然不值半文，供人「覆瓿」而已。戲台上扮演的岳飛，無論神似到如何極點，總不能指爲民族英雄。</p>
<p>吾深望有志於文藝的青年們，除致力於技巧的修鍊外，更致力於偉大的人格充實的人生的修養。以愷悌慈祥之氣，忠貞熱烈之忱，寫出至情至性之文，爲不虛此生的自己，爲抗戰建國的中華民族！</p>
<h3 id="c102">「胡大海」 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 荊樹森</p>
<p>提起了「胡大海」這個人，在當地百里之內，誰人不知，那個不曉，就是瘋狂的黃色動物，都要稱他一聲「大人」呢！</p>
<p>論「胡大海」的資格，倒也念過四書，讀過五經；可是他會把「國稅」二字，解作「國家衰所弱，以要百姓捐錢。」又會把論語上的「顏淵死，子哭之慟」一句，解作「顏淵死了之後，孔老夫子哭得來要鑽洞。」諸如此類的笑話，不知閙了多少。</p>
<p>本來，「胡大海」這一個名字，原是別人送給他的渾號；但是，顧名思義也就可以知道他是一個怎樣的形態和個性了。大約敵人看他有些憨頭憨腦吧，不知如何，却被呌做什麼藤的將軍賞識了，硬要呌他做官，加了一個交通大人的頭銜；—其實，不過利用他做一個看守公路和洋橋的小工罷了—還給他一面旗幟，一個臂章。那旗幟上還寫着七個大字，是：「胡大海大人正堂。」</p>
<p>平時，「胡大海」這個人，好像是有若無的；可是，被那位什麼藤將軍這麼一提拔，眾口一詞的都說「胡大海」正式做了漢奸了。但是「胡大海」並不和人分辯。</p>
<p>有一次，突然的「胡大海」同了一位全身武裝的敵人很高興的走進他的家里—落陽村，駭得滿村的人東奔西逃的亂竄；尤其是年青的女性。</p>
<p>當時，滿村的人都在咬牙切齒的咒咀着「胡大海」這小子，爲什麼在街上玩得不樂意，又把人領到鄉下來搗蛋，這不是「引鬼上門」麼！</p>
<p>嘿！「胡大海」這一次，隨便什麼人都夢想不到他會做出這樣勝於雄辯的事實來：那里是「引鬼上門，」分明是「關門捉鬼」啦！</p>
<p>原來，「胡大海」屢次的看到巡哨的敵人殘殺自國的同胞，蹂躪自國的女性，心中早已不忍；但是，在鐵蹄之下，苦於沒有機會下手。這一次，可給他候着了：他把其中最混蛋的一個，騙上了他自己的家里，好意的供待着酒飯；還把他自己的老婆呌出來勸酒，慢慢的把那個混蛋迷得爛醉，一下手奪過那枝慣殺人的武器殺了他！這就呌「以其人之道，還治其人。」</p>
<p>事後，每天的晚上，總有敵人的夥伴在落陽村的左近喊着「老大！老大……」這，大概就是那個被「胡大海」所殺的敵人的名字吧？</p>
<p>從此，公路上永不見那面「胡大海大人正堂」的旗幟，同時，在抗敵大本營—游擊隊的隊伍里却多了一個「胡大海」其人。</p>
<h3 id="c103">借宿 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇英</p>
<p>沒有月亮的夜。</p>
<p>黑暗籠罩着的王家村，田陌上沒有一個行人。</p>
<p>稀疏的槍聲，在遠遠地響着。王家村的狗，忽然汪汪的吠了起來。</p>
<p>王春發的大門上，像擂鼓似的響着。裏邊開門的是王春發，他看見一個穿短衣的高個子氣喘着立在門外：</p>
<p>「對不起，老鄉！前後都有鬼子追來。我一個兒，獨木不成林，讓我宿一晚，天明就走！」</p>
<p>「唔………你…」王春發還有些不明白他的來由。</p>
<p>「我是新×軍，今夜奉命到那邊殷家莊剿鬼。我們一起十二個，牠們倒有五十多。糟糕！十二個丟了十一個，我獨個兒溜到這兒。……老鄉！前面也有鬼子，快讓我躱一躱，天明準走！」他望了望東，再望一望西。</p>
<p>遠遠的槍聲，還是稀疏的響着。</p>
<p>「可以，可以！」王春發把高個子讓到屋裏，關上大門，閂了閂，撐了撐。</p>
<p>高個子要了條毛巾擦着汗。手在袋裏摸了摸，掏出一枝短槍。槍是空了，他看着槍點頭微笑：</p>
<p>「他媽的！滿槍子彈，都給鬼子吃掉！哈哈哈哈……」</p>
<p>王春發的大門又在響了，比剛才高個子還敲得緊。</p>
<p>王春發把高個子領進了後面的地坑裏。它的上面是一個臭猪　，兩隻肥猪沒有給他們驚醒，還在呼呼的酣睡着。</p>
<p>王春發剛把大門一開，四個猙獰的黃衣人擁到了裏邊。</p>
<p>他們搜了客堂，又搜櫥房；翻亂了臥室，攪遍了猪　，找不到高個子的影子。兩隻肥猪，給牠們攪得咕嚕着亂跑。一聲唿哨，他們去了。</p>
<p>王春發關了大門，閂了閂，撐了撐。</p>
<p>王春發家裏沒有聲音，靜，靜，靜到天明。</p>
<p>高個子跨出了王春發的大門，和王春發握了握手，點了點頭。</p>

<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>『沒有別的，我們太辛苦了，想找姑娘安慰安慰，也是「×支親善」之道呀！』</p>
<p>方慧退後一步，把手指着那×軍的盒子炮說：</p>
<p>『你們口裏說「親善」，却把這殺人的東西對着我，難道這也是「親善」之道嗎？』</p>
<p>那×軍笑了笑，正待把手裏的盒子炮交給後面的人，方慧連忙阻止他說：</p>
<p>『不行！傢伙在你們手裏，不論交給誰，總是一樣的，我決不上當。除非交給我，我才相信你是真心「親善」。』</p>
<p>那×軍起初頗遲疑了一會，後來仗着身後還有兩支槍，而且因心有所迷，不暇計較利害，居然放心托膽的把手裏的盒子炮交給方慧了。方慧接過了盒子炮，便含笑向那×軍招了招手說：『請進來吧！」</p>
<p>那×軍喜出望外，茅屋裏分明是枉死城，他却錯認做安樂窩，伸開兩手，打算來摟抱方慧。方慧早已準備好了，輕輕把盒子炮的機關一捩，砰的一聲，子彈正打在那×軍胸口，那×軍還來不及喊出聲，早已撲的倒下地去。其他兩個×軍見發生了這變故，忙都開槍向方慧射擊，雖然手電筒的光早已熄滅了，方慧的左臂上，畢竟也被擊中了一彈。幸好在左右兩邊屋裏的護士，聽得了槍聲，紛紛衝了出來，於是，在一塲劇烈的格鬥下，其他兩個×軍，也都一併被擊斃命，小小的殲滅戰，就此勝利地收塲。</p>
<p>方慧讓那軍醫處長代她裹了臂上的傷，便同了護士們，來呼喚村裏的民眾。那些老弱婦孺們已經聽得了槍聲，死也不肯出來，直到知道了沒有危險，才都戰戰兢兢的集合，及至看見茅屋門前的×軍屍身，又都不禁吃了一驚。方慧把方才殺敵的經過簡要地對她們報告了一遍，又向她們說：</p>
<p>『你們在敵人的手下作順民，是永遠要提心吊膽，不會得到片刻安寗的。現在我們做下了這件事，敵人說不定要在你們身上報復，我代你們打算，只有跟着我們一同去投奔葉團長所領導的游擊隊，才可以保全自己的性命，免受敵人的殘害。』</p>
<p>那些老弱婦孺們見殺死了×軍，本來就怕要累及自己，這時聽方慧這樣說，都覺得她的話不錯，便紛紛回去收拾衣服細軟。方慧又向她們借了副門板，把那三個×軍的屍體，胡亂堆在上面，連同獲得的戰利品，和在治療中的受傷勇士，分別由担架兵和民眾抬着，星夜向北走去，找尋葉團長的隊伍歸隊。（三七）</p>

<p>黃涵之</p>
<p>稽之往史。無所謂慈善團體也。養老慈幼。矝孤恤寡。與夫掩骼埋胔之事。胥在政治考成之列。故文王發政施仁。必先於鰥寡孤獨。後世政教漸喪。社會人士。本其好善之心。扶持救濟，以輔政治之不及。所謂八百孤寒。萬間廣廈。純屬個人之行誼矣。滬上五方雜處。人烟稠密。近歲以來。天災人禍。幾無寗日。加以生活日昂。失業日衆。於是慈善事業。亦日益推廣。</p>
<p>當民國十六年間。王一亭先生暨涵之等鑒於本市善團眾多。所辦事業。日漸擴充。宜有一統一之團體。集思廣益。聯絡一致。庶對內有整齊之計劃。對外有充實之力量。爰有上海慈善團體聯合會之組織。茲將聯合會各會員所辦事業。列舉如下。</p>

<p>上列之外。尚有各善團及由各公所會館同鄉會舉辦慈善者。無慮數十百處。要其所辦事業。不外上述諸項。八一三戰事爆發。各善團地址大都在南市閘北。其產業又在崑嘉松青等縣者居多。或燬於火。或刦於盜。其實際上損失數字。幾無從加以調查。事業遂多停頓。即在租界以內者。亦受重大影響。收入減少。經濟困難。勉爲維持而已。據最近上海慈善團體聯合會之書面調查各善團現狀如下。</p>

<p>廣業公義會　施材施藥　產業毀損甚鉅</p>
<p>其餘各善團。尚未據填報。總之此次兵災。各慈善團體產業幾毀損殆盡。欲求恢復。戞戞其難。至目前慈善事業。集中於救濟難民。茲將各救濟團體收容難民概況。略誌如下。</p>
<p>二十五年冬間。綏遠兵災。全市各善團共同發起上海慈善團體聯合救災會。派員赴綏。散放急振。至次年接辦川黔陝甘等省旱災。八一三事變。乃又產生救濟戰區難民委員會。組織僧侶救護隊營救前方傷兵。自辦難民病院三所。特約醫院四所。先後救護傷官兵民一萬餘人設置收容所。最多時達七十餘所。收容難民二十餘萬人。遺送五萬餘人。所需經費除政府援助外純恃中外慈善家。及熱心僑胞捐助而來。截至最近。用款達二百餘萬元。惟以處此環境之中。上海形成孤島。工商交困。金融緊迫。捐款已成弩末。前路茫茫。罔知所屆。乃不得不力事緊縮。主持之者亦衹有盡其民力而已。</p>
<p>同時臨時救濟難民團體。尚有非常時期救濟難民上海分會。迨淞滬淪陷。改爲上海慈善團體聯合救災會救濟戰區難民分會。中外慈善之士。有上海國際救濟會之組織。中國紅十字會亦產生國際委員會。爲滬上各救濟團體之協助機關。該會旋於十月底結束。中外各界。有感於此項協助機關性質之需要。乃又有上海救濟難民協會之成立。以遞嬗國際委員會任務。而協助各直接收容難民團體之給養。所有各團體現在收容之難民，約數如下。</p>
<p>一，上海慈善團體聯合救災會救濟戰區難民委員會所辦收容所三十。難民自給所四所。游民教養所一所。共三萬三千三百餘人。</p>
<p>二，戰區救濟難民委員會分會所辦收容所四十所。難民人數一萬九千七百餘人。</p>
<p>三，上海國際救濟會所辦收容所四所。難民人數一萬零二百餘人。</p>
<p>四，江寗同鄉會等所辦收容所三十一所。難民人數一萬零七百餘人。</p>
<p>五，南市難民區收容所一百十三所。難民貧民人數共四萬一千餘人。</p>
<p>以上收容所地點。南市難民區處。其在公共租界者計七十三所。難民五萬三千二百餘人。其在法租界者計八所。難民一萬五千八百餘人。</p>
<p>至同仁輔元堂暨普善山莊。自淞滬戰起。對於一般掩埋工作。出入戰區。冒險進行。勇敢精神。殊爲難得。塚地俱滿。租界範圍內。又難得空曠之地。困難尤甚。近入冬季。死亡較鮮。同仁輔元堂專任南市及法租界之掩埋事宜。普善山莊專任公共租界之掩埋事宜分清界限努力工作。此亦畸形之發展也。</p>
<h3 id="c107">上海之國藥業 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>上海之國藥業，言之頗多興味。藥店計爲三百八十三家，藥材行六十九家。與中藥業互相並行者爲西藥房，但以配方之數量計之，即知中醫藥事業根基之久，營業之盛，實有使人驚訝稱奇者·查中藥店每日配方：最多者竟達一千二百張，三百張者最普通，每家少亦五六十張，合計之上海每日中藥醉方共爲七萬張。華人西藥房辦理配方者，約五十八家，每日配方共三千張。由配方數量觀之，成一與二十六倍之比。</p>
<p>中藥店營業，以夏季爲最忙，而以冬季爲最優·近時膏方盛行，上月望日，胡慶餘堂一日營業收入，達二萬四千零三十五元。其他藥店，均因戰事人口集中，營業增加達百分之四十左右。今年新開者有四十家左右，年底營業虧折者，似不易得。通常全年營業達九百六十餘萬元，不可謂不盛矣！</p>
<p>中藥店資本以二三萬元者居多數，童涵春本額最巨，達一百念萬兩。職工人數，戰前計算，有三千四百七十五人，待遇較十年前大見進步。有同業公會，常委爲友人高志文，宋輔臣，邱延齡，沈和甫，及施琴堂君。</p>
<p>藥材行分行號兩種：藥行六十一家，草樂行八家，各幫字號尚有九十餘家，分山貨，北貨，川漢，廣貨，西貨之別。戰後新開達三十五家，其由戰後閒居組織者居一部份，可見戰後業務，實頗旺盛。藥行另組藥行業同業公會，組織極健全。友人毛子堅，費庭華，董伯偉，夏其振，陳文銘，諸公爲該業領袖。指揮擘劃，成績斐然，難民抽收附捐，其近事也。</p>
<p>藥行業除供應本外埠藥店外，並報關運諸世界各國。上海每年經藥行報關者，尚無統計，至少約在三百萬元以外。國民政府中央藥物研究所，近經統計，謂全國中藥外銷達一萬萬元，實爲抗戰經濟中之驚人收獲。中藥豈無用耶？華人不服中藥者，能無愧乎？</p>
<p>中藥功效既合國人體質，故其營業始終不衰。余見訂服膏方者之眾多，實使外界難以置信。北平宏仁堂開幕之日，售出阿膠達六十擔。馮存仁蔡同德之膠，年年銷數均鉅。余意中藥業若加改良，採納新智識份子之指導，逐一改良猛晋，其成績必有遠甚於今日之處。</p>
<p>中藥店之成藥營業，不及西藥遠甚。僅雷充上之六神丸，年銷四十二萬元以上；童涵春之再造丸，年銷二十二萬元以上；胡慶餘之辟瘟丹，年銷十萬錠；同春堂之百補膏，銷數亦浩鉅。此外不易指述。實則中國成藥，大堪提倡。近有夏鐵英君，創辦北平藥局，因全國成藥北平爲冠，故有此專門組織。開幕以來，業務奇盛，京藥口碑素佳，前途大有可觀。尚有三友實業社，年來注意國藥，治瘋丸日銷三百盒，尚非奇聞；方便丸上海日銷已一千五百瓶，香港南洋日銷達三千瓶，此乃真實挽回利　不少。余意中國成藥如用新式推銷法，營業頗易勝於通常西藥</p>
<p>尚有一點：上海各業掌故，推其歷史久而營業盛者，莫如國藥業。姜衍澤姚泰山二店，百年前載於上海縣志，其時上海一片荒蕪，國藥事業已巍然可觀！亦佳話也。</p>
<p>本文材料，由藥業名士孫文毅君指示最多。藥業公會費永祚君及蔣有成君亦有貢獻，附筆誌謝。</p>
<h3 id="c108">中華隊與萬國商團 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 明時浩</p>
<p>三十三年來之努力以及繙譯隊之成長</p>
<p>萬國商團簡史　上海闢埠九十五年來，萬國商團具有八十五年之悠久歷史矣。其由來雖屬古老，而軍備則頗具現代化，頻年雖以經濟竭蹶緊縮種種；然迄今猶包含英，美，華，日，俄，葡，菲，猶等不同國籍之二十餘隊伍，亦不失爲公共租界救急之武力焉。</p>
<p>考上海之有萬國商團，實肇始於西暦一八五三年，其組織之動機，蓋由於太平天國革命運動之影響，以彼時租界，各該租借國尚無駐兵自衛之權，各國僑商因鑒於洪楊軍聲勢蓬勃，界內治安岌岌可危，遂由上海各國領事集　共同防禦之策，決定組織各國義勇隊，征募旅滬商人入伍，聘英國駐印軍官屠郎孫上尉爲司令，時美僑亦自成一隊，另由凱來上尉指揮，此即萬國商團之發端。泥城戰役之後，曾一度解散。一八六〇年太平軍二次起事，勢力復盛，遂重行募集，成立兩隊，每隊猶僅八十人，二年後在上尉鮑蘭思指導之下，陸續擴充，始漸具規模。一八七〇年有步兵三隊，輕騎一隊，團員達二百人，並由香港運到過山砲兩尊，因即成立野砲隊。一八七八年全國重行改組，輕騎隊退出，另編步兵兩隊，時司令爲都立台氏，直至一八八二年都氏返國，始由其弟繼任其職。一八八三年全團舉行第一次檢閱時，官長已有一七六人。越三年，砲隊復由英政府捐助，得有大砲四尊。至一八九五年，乃有葡萄牙隊之加入，嗣輕騎隊亦告恢復，一九〇〇年即庚子拳亂之後，全團復大事更張，時司令爲葛拉克少校，團員則爲三百五十人，後海關隊，美國隊，日本隊，鐵甲車隊次弟成立，相繼加入，始達千人，實力亦大增；同時工部局復發起組織機關槍隊，並購辦輕機槍多挺，分發各隊應用，自是之後，漸次演進，日臻完善！總司令（團長）之職權亦趨繁重，其初團長均屬義務，至此遂由工部局呈請英軍部派遣武官來滬專司其事，並定三年一任。第一任團長爲華生少校，即繼任麥根泉上尉者，時爲一九〇五年，至一九〇八年由彭司少校繼任。一九一三年則爲白雷少校。歐戰起，全體軍人奉召回國，參加戰役，致一時無從派遣，遂由英軍部委任領袖團官屠魯門少校爲司令，負責團務。戰後復行舊制，其繼任團長，計爲一九二〇年少將曼埃強生，一九二五年上校戈登，一九二八年上校亞本派茂，一九三一年上校滑慕思，一九三四年上校葛雷亨；至現任團長爲項培上校；係一九三七年接任；最近全團人數正備平均爲二千四百餘人，除俄團丁約四百名係僱用性質外，其餘均屬義務團員，各隊人數多者百餘，少者四五十人。至萬國商團統轄之權，則屬之工部局董事會，工部局總董在該團有行政長官之職責。其編制法最高爲團總司令部，下分團本營，A字營，B字營，C字營，而步馬砲與鐵甲車機關槍等隊均在其指揮之下，茲將萬國商團各隊入團之先後及名稱分列如下（以正式核准之年月爲序）。</p>

<p>美輕騎隊　一九二三年九月</p>
<p>小砲隊　一九二四年九月</p>
<p>俄團丁　一九二七年一月</p>
<p>俄國隊　一九二八年十月</p>
<p>菲列賓隊　一九三二年二月</p>

<p>中華隊之回顧　上海通商以還，國際組織，向無國人地位，有之，當自商團始，蓋以國勢積弱，外人之於華人，遂多歧視，故租界之有萬國商團，華人初亦不與。直至一九〇五年，大鬧會審公廨案起，地方治安，擾攘不可終日，於是華商領袖虞洽卿，袁恒之，胡寄梅等，以商團維持地方治安，保護居民生命財產，爲當時急不可緩之要圖，隨即邀集各業領袖百餘人爲之董事，籌款組織，設備種種，初名華商體操會，嗣改稱華隊公會，一時應召而集之隊員計五百餘人，分爲軍樂一隊，騎兵一隊，步兵四隊等，並購辦軍裝槍械，設立操塲，健身房，此實爲中國商團之鼻祖，後以華隊之設，原與旅居租界華人有極深之關係，且既同居租界，自亦負有保護界內商民之天職，爰呈請工部局加入萬國商團爲中華隊，遂於一九〇七年在南京路市政廳簽定八十三人入隊之約。</p>
<p>最初之淬勵　約既簽定，團長華生乃呈准工部局委任向爲海關隊隊長之柯畢特爲華隊隊長，葛雷烈，水克二人爲副隊長，華人僅得以棚長資格代理排長職務，然以全體隊員委曲求全，力爭上游，始終保持純正之結合，遂使中外人士移其疑慮之觀念，而爲熱烈之欽佩，得與各國隊伍平等待遇，以至華隊成今日之盛況，又豈當日所敢預冀哉！</p>
<p>奮鬥之過程　華隊成立之後，第一次參加全體射擊比賽，爲一九〇九年之「腦維司」獎杯，一鳴驚人，成績獨優，當時備受中外各界贊許。其後全團比賽及對外比賽，無不名列前茅，述其犖犖大者，如全團稱職大盾比賽，獲勝七次之多。他若國際賽槍所獲勝利，尤難盡述，至華隊操射之認真，紀律之嚴明，眾所共知，所有人隊諸員，平時咸能堅苦卓絕，奉法耐勞，一經出防，雖酷暑嚴寒，不辭勞瘁。</p>
<p>歷屆出防紀錄　華隊成立迄今參加全團出防凡十一次，計爲一九一一年之上海光復，一九一二年之二次革命，一九一四年之三次革命，一九一八年之人力車風潮及同年之小販罷市，一九一九年之「五四」運動，一九二四年之江浙齊盧戰役，一九二五年之「五卅」慘案，一九二七年之國民軍北伐，一九三二年之「一二八」中日戰役，及最近「八一三」抗戰之役。每次亂事，華隊莫不首先動員，而最後撤防，至出防期內華隊之任務，無異普通軍隊，或守衛巡邏防止暴徒，或供給譯員以應緊急時期之絕大需要</p>
<p>繙譯隊之由來　自「一二八」及「八一三」兩次出防，譯員效用益見顯著，蓋以各國軍警商團，　集一隅，調動頻繁，於本地方言，殊苦阻閡，爲欲免除誤會，裨利治安，因而急需就地覓助，此繙譯隊之所由來也。往時此項譯員，每說中華隊內調撥熟嫻外國語之隊員充任；而形成集團之組織，則在「一二八」滬變出防，始粗具規模，當時通曉西語之各商行華員，應募投效者甚眾，服務於各友邦駐軍及商團防綫，爲中外兵民任舌人工作，免除隔膜，融洽感情，頗著成績；惟彼時實爲臨時性質，迨後團長滑慕思上校，深覺此項組織有永久設立之必要，爰呈請工部局核准，遂於是年十月一日正式成立爲萬國商團之一隊。共隊長一職，當委中華隊隊長陳時俠氏兼任，着手軍事訓練，同時並委任王廷魁，鮑咸鏘，張籋雲爲隊官，襄助一切，至其隊員服裝槍械訓練等，均同於一般團員。近年該隊隊員稱職者，亦常達百二十人之譜，且該隊成立未久，上屆即已獲勝全國稱職銀盾。去年「八一三」之役，該隊工作尤屬可貴，出生入險，備極辛勞。</p>
<p>歷任隊長及最近概況　華隊成立後，除首二任隊長英人柯畢特及葛雷烈二君外，其後繼任者即爲徐通浩氏，（現任團副，一度曾任全團總司令之職）胡筠秋氏，（現任團部華事顧問）郝伯陽氏，張廷榮氏，王衍慶氏。曾任隊官者爲屠閒泰氏，楊文卿氏，王志仁氏（現任常備軍官）；現任中華隊及繙繹隊隊長陳時俠氏，係「一二八」戰役接任；中華隊隊官現爲余顯恩，李玉書，周慶恩，張廷桂諸君；繙繹隊隊官則有王延魁，徐紹榕，夏冉禹，鍾玉亭等，近年以各隊官長領導有方，以及各級隊員之努力，隊務成績，益見騰踔，人數亦激增，最近正常，後預，各備隊員不下六百餘人，領袖全團，競榮國際，實屬難能。吾人瞻望未來，詎容限量，近聞該隊正開始招募本年度新隊員，有志之士，願共歸之。」</p>

<h3 id="c109">登記求職與物色人才 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 張琳</p>
<p>失業問題在今日的上海，眞是嚴重極了，統計數字之高，眞打破了以往的紀錄；據報載日內瓦國際勞工局中國科所作的統計，單就工人一項，已有三十萬人；我們從這一種的數字上，就可以推測到整個上海的失業數字一定是相當高大的。上海的目前情况，雖然有一個繁榮的外表，但其內在呢？工，商，農，學各部門的從業員非但沒有增多，而且還在减少，致使一般無業者—尤其是知識與技能較差的，更無從獲得出路，而同時，近來更有數千遭到不幸命運的猶太人，到中國來「掘金」的日本人，以及無業的白俄等等，接踵而來，使得上海的容納問題，日益困難了。</p>
<p>在失業在潮這樣澎湃的時候，向介紹職業的機關，登記求職，固然不能肯定其有把握，然而，也許有些希望。</p>
<p>中華職業敎育社所附設的上海職業指導所，因爲有相當歷史和信譽，它所担負介紹職業與物色人才的工作，就受到社會的推崇；祇要踏進門，看到那許多請求登記的失業人　集在那一間辦公室裏的情况，就可以知遭失業人的衆多，與該所工作的艱重。尤其是近年來，每天工作的幾小時內總要接受幾十或一二百人的登記，談話。（概不取費）</p>
<p>向該所登記的第一步手續，就是填寫求職表，除了把自己的履歷詳細塡入外，並且，還要把本身擅長的學術，巳往的經騐，和精神與物質的希望，詳細塡入，然後再塡寫談話登記表，靜候順次登記，談話。</p>
<p>談話之後，對於登記者的外表，態度，言語，舉止，顯著的性格，身體的特點等等，都逐一記錄下來，然後以此爲標準，相機介紹職業；不過，在每天登記的許多人之中而得介紹成就者，其數字是相當低微，——這原因，自然是多方面的。</p>
<p>現實社會中雖然有了這許多無業人，然而各部門事業中缺乏人才却又相當嚴重；向該所請求代物色人才的機關，廠商也很多，不過其所需要的範圍，大多是技術人才，例如：實業廠家的工程師，技師，化學物品的製造技師，手工藝的導師，學校裹專門學科的敎師，以及有技能的工人。</p>
<p>該所於接受請求後，若登記者中無此種人才，就在報上公開徵求；祇要稍爲注意各大報本埠新聞中短訊的讀者，大概總常常可以看見的。據云，有各種專門人才公開徵求，還不可得；可見社會中有知識，有技能的人太少，相反的，平平庸庸之輩實在太多；若把現實社會中任何部門都希望獲得充足的人才，和一般平庸之輩都希望獲得良好的職業，這兩個困難的焦點，加以調合起來，實在是不可能的事情，除了敎育普及，一般人求學的經濟負担能力提高以外。</p>
<p>不過，我們總希望一般人儘可能的去學習知識，技能，煆練體格，不要因爲無錢無業而徘徊終日，去「等」職業。</p>
<h3 id="c110">「老當益壯」 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 費人</p>
<p>「敬老」是美德，但敬祇是「敬」而已；並沒有「頌」的意思。可是在中國，相傳下來，「老」是稱之爲「人瑞」的，「百齡大會」之類的盛舉，是被「頌揚」備至的。其實，人類的夭折與長壽，是很自然的現象，至多，使我學習一點「衛生之道」，譬如什麼藥房等是常常以「老人」的「養生術」來作爲宣傳的廣告。</p>
<p>昨天是馬相伯先生的百齡大慶，復旦大學同學會在新新酒樓舉行慶祝大會。「慶祝」云者，自然也有「頌揚」的意思，那末是否多此一舉呢？這裹恰恰相反，馬相伯先生的百齡大慶是應該「頌揚」値得「頌揚」的，因爲我們「頌揚一的不是馬相伯先生的百齡」，而是「頌揚」馬相伯先生的「精神」。</p>
<p>雖然他在致復旦大學同學會函中，是這樣寫着：「自戰事發生以來，國無甯土，民不聊生，流離異域，正愧無德無能，每嫌多壽多辱，乃厚承慶我祝我，自覺難堪耳。」但是馬相伯先生爲什麼「流離異域」呢，他芷是爲了「不聊生」的「民」和「無甯土」的「國」在努力，在奔走，這種「精神」是應該而値得我們「頌揚」的！反之，卽使你年少英俊，豐姿翩翩，但在「精神」上你反而是一個「老朽」哩！</p>
<p>所以，「老當爲壯」，也同樣並不是指這軀殼的壯健如恒，而是精神的如壯年時一樣虎虎有生氣，在馬相伯先生百齡誕辰之期，就以此四字共伸慶祝之意，同時策勵自己，我們年靑的一羣，更應努力，上進！</p>
<h3 id="c111">雨過天青 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>

<p>第六回　誇人瑞一苗挺三秀　叙友情二士會羣英</p>
<p>這時何麗玉很爲高興，便道：『那末道三個孩子，還在你們那裏嗎？我一定要去看看！記得我們在美國的時候，不是爲了加拿大摩斯鎭的一胎生了五女，轟動了全世界。不但是訪問者戶限爲穿，倒挑了電影界發了一筆大財，一年總有好幾張影片，都是借着這五位小妹妹來吸引觀衆的。除了拍電影以外，便是把她們做慶告。什麼關於兒童的藥品，化妝品，全都把這五個小姊妹作爲商標。我們現在雖然一胎二兒，人家兩雙半，我們只有一雙半，還差了一雙。但是也覺得是希罕，在古時說起來，也要算是人瑞呀。』朱愛人笑道：『你門要去看，我們不但不拒絕，而目是很歡迎咧。這三位小弟弟，我們差不多每一個月給他們照一次相。從初生的七朝裹照起，一直照到現在，總共也照了十餘次照了。每照一次相，我們總記着他們幾個月又多少天。有一本照相簿子，都依次貼着他們的照，我們要看看他們發育起來的程序。我們不久又要給他們照相了，我們還希望你們兩人，和他們三個，合照一個相，這是很有意思。你要看時，明天就可以領你去看，但是不能白給你們看，你們須出見面錢的呀！』說話中間，已經漸漸臨近朱愛人道個醫院的村鎭了。原來這個鎭，本來喚做安樂鎭，這個婦需醫院初造在那裹時，鎭上的人家也不多，不過數十家人家而已。就是那個醫院，也是規模不大，僅僅是一個敎堂，附屬着一個醫院。後來經那位童聲師苦心經營，她是一位守貞不嫁的信道者，熱心救世，很有許多人受她的感動。她的醫院，便一天發達一天，連帶着地方上也一天熱鬧一天。現在區域也擴大了，金鎮固圍算起來，共有七八百家人家。不但如此，鎭上還有幾家小工廠。這鄰村鄰鎭，都是養蠶人家，除了私家養蠶之外，鎭十還有幾處集體養蠶　。此外小工廠中，却有好幾家織布廠，這些養蠶塲，織布廠，以女工爲多，也和婦孺醫院最有因緣。至於其他如小學校，圖書館，也應有盡有。電燈電活等各種設備，稍爲繁盛一些的市鎭，差不多已普及了。（六五）</p>
<h3 id="c112">「逍遙艷侶觀感」 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>華納公司出品　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>像「逍遙艷侶」（Going　Places那樣的戲，在好萊塢，那正是太多了。我想我還是「故事是這樣的二下來讓讀奢們自己去回味你們所看過的這一類戲，——跑馬，音樂，歌唱的所謂「香艷滑稽片」吧。</p>
<p>「逍遙艷侶」的「故事是道樣的」：</p>
<p>「少年彼得，爲體育用品公司職員，奉公司主人命，冒充澳洲名騎師彼得倫道爾，携帶大批體育用品赴瑪利南推銷，因該地即將舉行賽馬大會」。於是乎，這個「冒脾名騎師」遇到了喜歡觀賽馬的上校魏特林和他的太太，也認識了上校的兒子傑克和姪女愛倫——一對均喜蓄馬的年靑人。</p>
<p>更巧的是傑克愛駒名『吉波士克里波士』，驚野不馴，無人敢御之；　馬夫迦比善知馬意，每當馬野性發作時輙吹喇叭奏其特製歌曲，馬便俯首貼耳，馴服異常一。而那位愛倫小姐的呢？她的名駒愛蓮姑娘」是一頭「歷次參加比賽，均名落孫山」的馬，今見彼得騎術精嫺，力懇其助之奪取冠軍。</p>
<p>彼得的「騎術精嫺」是何由得見的呢？是：「吉波士克里波士」受驚奔出馬廄，彼得適跌落在馬背上：後來，是虧得　「迦比乘機器脚踏車隨後追來，以喇叭吹奏歌曲，馬聞樂聲立卽停步」，圍遂解。</p>
<p>可是正是再巧也沒有，在比賽前，「愛蓮姑娘」被竊了，於是這個「冒牌名騎師」便騎了「吉波士克里波士」參加比賽。</p>
<p>這一比賽，也照得好萊塢的「香艷滑稽片」的慣例，當然是要「奪獲冠軍」的，並且，英雄佳人，相　而End．</p>
<p>「逍遙艷侶」也正如此，一些兒也不例外。至於致勝之道，則是「迦比依計率領一班樂隊，乘汽車沿跑道高奏爲最喜歡之歌曲一。不過，這一次不是「馬　樂聲立即停步」了，這一次是「一路領前」，是正如作者所幻想那般的如意而順當。</p>
<p>這樣的故事，於你是熟悉的：「我好像在什麼片子裏看見過」？你這麼想，是不是？</p>
<p>自然，你的記憶並不正確，因爲「逍遙艷侶」是第一次在上海公映；然而也不能說你錯，因爲這一類的片子，原是「差不多」。</p>
<p>然則「逍遙艷侶」滑稽不滑稽呢？敬答曰：我舉一個例，你看滑稽不滑稽：馬夫善知馬意，他的喇叭能使驚馬進退如意，如作奢所想像那樣的，可以隨其「立即停步」，也可以「一路領前」。你說這滑稽不呢</p>
<p>至於狄克鮑惠爾的彼得，他祇是默在馬背上而巳，此外就祇是和愛尼泰露意絲等合唱一支歌。那支歌，在舞塲的樂隊也許會參用的，因爲在舞塲中，已有了很多的這樣歌了，多一支，不是更好，也不是更可以顯得新鮮些嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c113">女職員的生活（續） <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 海嘯</p>
<p>所以投考女職員，一定要有標準的「賣相」，不然你就是滿口的Yes.All-right.講得像外人一模一樣，也恐很難合格的。</p>
<p>不過投考的資格，雖沒有正確的規定，但至少須有中學肆業或畢業的程度，對於英語會話是很注重的，至於國內的各地言語，也極注重的，例如廣東語啊，北方話啊，是很爲大闆所歡迎的，其次就要挨到珠算，也在考試的重要節目之一。而對於國文，好像處於最次要的地位，只要你能會塗便條子，便母庸担心「名落孫山」了。</p>
<p>說到女職員的薪給，在同一的職位上也是很有高低的，每月從七八元到二十多元，巳是碰天了，但這幾塊錢，怎够用呢？僅在她們的化裝消費上講，也着實可觀了！所以有許多女職員，除開自己尋來自己用外，還要家庭裹父兄來塡補的，顯然，女職員的一身摩登裝飾，原是「窮漢裝闊相」，空撑塲面啊！</p>
<p>現在讓我來談談女職員的業餘生活吧。一個人的生活，是很容易給周圍環境所影響的，能够支配環境的人，就是理智最淸醒者，意志最堅决者。往往一憫純樸天眞的女子，剛從校門裹出來，走進了這些豪華糜爛的境遇裹，耳目所染，便轉變了起來。本來不燙髮的，也學着大家燙起髮來；以往見了人家穿高跟鞋會覺古怪厭惡的，但現在也竟穿着習以爲常了；以往很關懷國事的，但現在連看一張報紙也沒趣。說起來，女職員也是個知識分子，但在眼前一般的講來，在一百個女職員中，會每天讀讀報紙的，實在不過十人左右吧。這不是作者故意的「危詞聳聽」是目所見耳所聞的事實啊！或許在女職員中的警覺者，也有着同樣的感喟吧</p>
<p>說到她們的一般業餘消遺，在一部分男同寨的引導下，很多經常在電影院戲館裹出入，自然他們主要的目的，是利用電影院來過「僞戀愛」生活。不過大半女職員的　餘生活還是在自己家庭裹，幫助父母操作着瑣碎的家事，或渾渾噩噩地過着家庭的私生活。</p>
<p>自然我們也不能抹煞有一小部分的女職員在抗戰的砲聲中她們已是覺醒起來了，參加着各種直接間接的抗戰工作，在奢侈的環境中，她們堅定自己的意志，更積極地向着一般意志模糊的女同事，進行喚醒組織的神聖任務，也就是爲了解放婦女運動而幹的基礎工作，道些切實苦幹的女戰士，是値得我們大家來頌揚的。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e3">The International Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of the civilization and welfare of all mankind, how can a second world war be appropriate? Analyzing it further from an international perspective: China is currently in the midst of resisting aggression and building the nation, progressing on both fronts. Although the world's state of peace or war will inevitably have a double-edged impact on China, the most urgent task is to defend against aggression and seek survival. All efforts and resources are focused on this, so the world's state of peace or war is naturally regarded as a secondary matter and does not evoke a deep sense of interest. Japan has been invading for years, exhausted and at the end of its rope, with a bleak future and unable to stop. Given this abnormal situation, it may have a unique understanding of the world's peace or war and may even fear that the world will not be in chaos. However, while claiming to be sacred and anti-communist, it sits idly by as the Soviet Union auctions off fishing grounds and does not dare to launch a single arrow, retreating in hesitation. This shows that it does not want to expand the war either. As for Britain and France, they used to compromise and yield to pressure, but the appeasement policy has reached its limit, causing them deep pain and leaving them in a dilemma. However, their subjective intention is still to serve as pillars of peace. The Soviet Union advocates socialism in one country and can calmly observe the situation from a distance, unaffected by the great whirlpool. However, the achievements of the successive five-year plans are only meant to ensure that it is not threatened by violent neighbors. It may wait for the opportunity to watch the fire from across the river, believing that its opportunities will be even better after it has grown stronger, but this is not the case at present. The United States of North America is separated by vast oceans and has a significant influence. The government is cautious, and the opposition party still believes that isolation is the best way to win popular support, which is a sign of its aversion to war. Italy is noisy and impulsive, driven by greed, anger, envy, and hatred. It sharpens its knives and tests them once in Abyssinia and again in Spain. However, its so-called aspirations, which are directed at the Mediterranean, only have a colorful impact through indirect means. It does not have the great courage to fulfill its great desires. Its warriors who have penetrated deep into Spain are still controlled by General Franco and have not crossed the red line. Its warmongering is truly limited to Abyssinia. Germany has cleverly seized and annexed territories without bloodshed, dominating the European continent and creating an unapproachable aura. However, its subjective and objective conditions are not yet ready to become the world's hegemon through a single war. Its annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia without war should not be taken as clear evidence of its warmongering. As for other countries, they cannot be decisive factors in victory, nor can they rely on their own strength to ensure their own survival. In the event of a major war, it is not guaranteed that they will not be sacrificed as stray bullets, let alone be able to profit from it. Therefore, they sincerely pray for peace. Based on this analysis, it can be said that every country wants international peace and that every person fears and curses war. However, the dynamic evolution of events has reached a point where there is no longer any basis, whether in theory, belief, method, or strength, to give people a glimmer of hope for peace. It seems that the outbreak of a major war is only a matter of time. Mankind claims to be the most intelligent of all beings, but they kill each other uncontrollably. How pitiful! Only five days have passed since Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, but the human spirit has suddenly changed. What Germany has done demonstrates that: ambition is insatiable and will continue to progress step by step without end, firstly. Treaty promises and vows are equal to waste paper and nonsense and have no value at all, secondly. The appeasement policy is just a fool's dream, thirdly. These three points have not only deceived and betrayed British Prime Minister Chamberlain, French Prime Minister Daladier, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, but have also declared the death sentence of international diplomacy with the atrocities of one country. From now on, all languages and words will become useless objects. International relations will only be maintained in two ways: either tolerating atrocities or resisting atrocities. The United States, Britain, and France can no longer remain tolerant and have issued unwavering rebukes one after another. In addition to protesting, Britain and France have recalled their ambassadors to Germany. Britain has discussed abandoning party differences and forming a national unity cabinet. The French parliament has established an authorization law, granting the government great powers to act as it sees fit. The United States has imposed a punitive tax of 25% on German goods, a disguised trade embargo, and has suddenly taken wartime measures for the manufacture of aircraft and the training of air force personnel. These measures cannot be said to necessarily lead to a major war, but they are undoubtedly signs of the eve of a major war. Moreover, Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia is not enough, and it has made economic demands on Romania, intending to turn the Romanian people into Germany's eternal agricultural slaves. The Romanian government has sought help from Britain, and Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, and other five countries have expressed their support for Romania as a shield against violence. This is a matter that deserves great attention. Some ethnic Germans living in Eastern and Central Europe have taken the opportunity to demand that their territories be returned to their homeland. It can be seen that Germany's agents are spread everywhere, and any movement can affect the overall situation. This is another matter that deserves great attention. There are rumors that Italy will make demands on France soon. This is another matter that deserves great attention. These three matters are likely to trigger a major war. Every country wants international peace and curses war, as mentioned above, but why is a major war almost imminent? It is the inertia of politics, it is the inertia of mankind. The ambition of ambitious countries is insatiable, they abandon all treaty promises and vows, and they fool the appeasement policy. Germany, Italy, and Japan have been doing this for a long time, not just since the annexation of Czechoslovakia. If they had been contained from the beginning, then maintaining the status quo would have been the inertia. However, they have been tolerated, allowed to act freely, and directly or indirectly rewarded, and as a result, they have become arrogant and extravagant. They have gained more and more, their reliance has grown thicker, and their strength has increased. As a result, they have taken aggressiveness as their inertia, and it is difficult to make them return to a state of rest. Moreover, the "peace first" theory of the past few years has dimmed justice and righteousness, and the weak have been sacrificed. The warmongers have taken aim at peace and flaunted their power and prestige, selling their tactics of coercion and attack. The overall situation is such, and it has a long history. Today, if countries do not resist violence, they can only tolerate it. To effectively resist violence, one must take the initiative to stop it. If the strength is sufficient, one can hope to stop the war with war. If they continue to delay until the disaster is imminent, then they will have gained more, their reliance will have grown thicker, and their strength will have increased. Who will rule the world is unknown.</p>

<p>Over Two Hundred Bombs Dropped, British Missionary in Pingjiang Already Placed in Coffin</p>
<p>Shashi. At around 3:00 PM on the 18th, eight Japanese planes attacked Shashi in two batches, three planes in one batch and five planes in the other. After circling the city twice, they flew into the airspace above Jiangling, dropping 25 bombs, killing and wounding over 50 civilians, and destroying over 50 civilian houses. The American Church of Christ, the Methodist Church, was also hit by three bombs, killing three people. (18th Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanyang. At 9:30 AM on the 18th, 13 Japanese planes entered the airspace above Xuchang in two batches, dropping two or three dozen bombs, destroying dozens of houses. The residents had already evacuated, so there were not many casualties. Yicheng and other places in northern Hubei were also bombed, details to be investigated. (18th Telegram)</p>
<p>Xiangyang. Xiangfan has been bombed by Japanese planes for three consecutive days, especially severely today. At around 12:00 noon, nine Japanese planes, three of which bombed Xiangyang and six of which bombed Fancheng. At 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM, six Japanese planes repeatedly bombed the area in relays, dropping a total of over two hundred bombs.

<p>(Chongqing) Chinese troops near Fancheng shot down a Japanese plane. Japanese planes attacked Xiangyang, a Chinese military base in central China, as well as Zhengzhou, a key point connecting the Longhai and Pinghan railways. (19th Huitong Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changsha) The British missionary Li Xiebong, who was killed by Japanese planes in Pingjiang, was the head of the Pingjiang Union District of the Hunan Diocese of the Methodist Church. He was only 35 years old, graduated from the London Methodist Theological Seminary, came to China in 1931, returned to London once in 1937, and came to China again in January of this year. Li was praised by the locals for his administration of the Pingjiang church. When Japanese planes attacked Pingjiang on the 15th, Li was taking refuge in an air-raid shelter next to Qinren School with Pastor Gao Keli and his servant's family of seven. The shelter was hit by a bomb, killing Li and his servant's entire family. Pastor Gao escaped from the rubble and was slightly injured. Pastor Baker Fang, the head of the Hunan Diocese of the Methodist Church, rushed to Pingjiang from Changsha on the morning of the 17th after hearing the bad news to take care of the aftermath for Li. He returned to Changsha that evening. The reporter visited him and learned that Li's body had been dug out from the collapsed air-raid shelter. The condition was terrible and he will be buried in Pingjiang. Pastor Baker also said that Pingjiang had been attacked by Japanese planes 27 times as of the 15th. Because the county is an undefended city, the Japanese planes flew low over the city to observe and drop bombs each time. The Pumou Hospital and Peiren School, which are run by the Methodist Church, are connected to the pastor's residence and occupy a large area in Xiguan, Pingjiang. The rooftops are marked with British flags and have huge British flags hanging on them. It is believed that the Japanese pilots must have known that this was the location of the British charitable organization during the 27 attacks. However, they dropped four large bombs, which makes us feel resentful. The British in Hunan have urgently telegraphed the British Embassy in China to report Li's death in the Japanese bombing, and have also telegraphed his wife in London and his four-year-old daughter to report the bereavement.

<p>Qi Exposes Japanese Conspiracy to Drugging Mongolians, Predicts Prince De Will Soon Revolt</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Qi Peizhang (transliteration), a young Mongolian nobleman aged 28, was sent to Tokyo for studies by Prince Demchugdongrub in 1934. He was recalled at the end of last year to serve as Prince De's confidential secretary. Although Qi studied in Japan, he is an anti-Japanese activist. He recently crossed the western part of Suiyuan, overcoming many dangers to reach Chongqing. He reported the situation in Inner Mongolia to the National Government. According to his statement to the Associated Press, he "eloped" after serving as a confidential secretary to the "Mongolian United Autonomous Government" for 28 days. He said that the Japanese are currently intensifying the training of young people in Inner Mongolia under the principle of "Asia for Asians". They claim that the Mongolian and Japanese people share the same origin thousands of years ago. Therefore, the Japanese established a "Mongolian College" in Guihua and "Youth Schools" in Zhangjiakou and Baotou, intending to drug the Inner Mongolian youth and make them pro-Japanese. In addition, the Japanese are also encouraging opium smoking and prostitution in Inner Mongolia. Qi said that Prince De has always been regarded as a traitor, but "he is not so bad as all that." Under Japanese surveillance, Prince De appears to be in great pain. The Japanese garrison in Inner Mongolia consists of only one division, while the Mongolian army under Prince De has nine divisions. They are supplied by the Japanese Kwantung Army from the Northeast, like parasites of the Kwantung Army. The Mongolian army is under strict surveillance by the Japanese army, so it has no heavy artillery. Qi predicted that Prince De would soon revolt. When he left Prince De's headquarters at the end of January, he learned that the Japanese were rushing to build fortifications at various passes between Inner and Outer Mongolia to prevent invasion from Outer Mongolia.

<p>Hopes to Establish Cooperative Associations in Guerrilla Areas to Supply Chinese Army Needs and Prevent Japanese Goods Sales</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Alec, Deputy Director of the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement, has returned here today after departing from Jiangxi and inspecting cooperative centers in the Northwest provinces. It is said that the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement is currently undertaking a large-scale plan. The objectives of this movement are: (1) to supply the industrial needs of the interior during wartime; (2) to help solve the wartime refugee problem; (3) to help solve the problem of disabled soldiers; and (4) to reduce the need for imported goods. This movement hopes to establish cooperative associations in the guerrilla areas to meet the needs of the guerrillas and prevent the sale of Japanese goods in the occupied areas. This movement began last autumn after Alec traveled from Shanghai to Wuhan and presented his plan to Chinese leaders. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President H.H. Kung have expressed their concern for this. According to a spokesperson for the movement, there are currently five headquarters, one each in the Northwest provinces, the Southwest provinces, the Southeast provinces, the Sichuan-Kang provinces, and Yunnan province. A total of 179 industrial cooperatives have been established. It is hoped that the number will reach about 500 within two months. The goal of this movement is to establish 30,000 industrial cooperatives throughout the country. It is now planned to establish industrial cooperatives in the interior to develop small-scale industries. According to Alec, although there are many Chinese laborers, they are not intellectuals, but they quickly understand the meaning of cooperation. He was particularly impressed by this point. He happily observed female factory workers in the Northwest provinces working in the giant caves of the mountains. They had been evacuated from Hankou to the Northwest through the efforts of Madame Chiang Kai-shek. In response to Mr. Alec's questions, they unanimously stated that they hoped to continue their current lives and did not want to return to factory life in Hankou. Currently, several locations have a daily business volume of as much as 10,000 yuan. Those in charge of this movement have recently appealed for continued capital allocation to expand this movement to all parts of China. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">French Chamber of Deputies Passes Government's Full Powers Bill <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>France is Embarking on the Path of War Preparation; Premier Stresses the Seriousness of the Situation</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the Chamber of Deputies granted French Premier Daladier the dictatorial power to deal with omnipotent countries, France has embarked on the basis of war. This power is only seen since the Clemenceau cabinet in the Great War. The power requested by the French Premier in the original proposal is limited to November of this year, and may be extended if necessary. When the Chamber of Deputies voted yesterday, the Socialist Party proposed two counter-proposals, which were both rejected by 316 votes to 262 and 328 votes to 254. The bill has now been submitted to the Senate, which is expected to pass it in the same way. The cabinet is scheduled to meet today and tomorrow to discuss how to promote measures to enhance France's military and industrial strength. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The full powers bill proposed by the government, after being discussed twice in the Chamber of Deputies, was passed by a vote of 321 to 264. Beforehand, many amendments proposed by members of the opposition parties were rejected one by one. Premier Daladier also delivered a tough speech, stressing that this bill must not be altered by a single word. He said that if the country encounters an emergency in the future, the government must take various measures to deal with it within hours, and it is impossible not to have full powers. The situation of the Chamber of Deputies meeting is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies this morning, Schmidt, the reporter of the Finance Committee, immediately submitted a review report, saying that various military measures occupy a larger position, and it is important to expedite the manufacture of military equipment and stockpile raw materials. Right-wing member Grilis continued to speak, stating that the current situation was caused by the Munich Agreement. If a war occurs in the future, its danger will be greater than six months ago. How can we give full powers to the signatories of the Munich Agreement? Bergerie, a left-wing independent member, advocated national unity and convening a world economic conference to discuss the promotion of international trade. Maran, leader of the right-wing Republican Federation, expressed his trust in Premier Daladier. Essgarde-Figeac, a centralist member, said that after the Czech incident, reconciliation between France and Italy was easier than before. The Chamber of Deputies immediately rejected the amendments proposed by the opposition parties by a vote of 334 to 258.</p>
<p>(2) At the afternoon meeting, Communist leader Dougroux and Socialist member Mounet successively spoke, both opposing the government's full powers bill. Right-wing members Roland and Hélo stated that they were willing to vote in favor. Premier Daladier then delivered a speech, stating that the French government has lodged a strong protest against Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. The situation is so serious that empty words cannot solve the problem. The reason for requesting the passage of the full powers bill is to quickly respond to major incidents. This is a "matter of hours" and cannot be delayed. Members, please answer with yes or no. If you want to amend it, even a single word is unacceptable to me. Although there are many thorns ahead, I firmly believe that my compatriots will be able to work together to overcome them. Even if some people do not think it is possible, I will ignore them and continue to move forward. At this point, we must intensify our efforts. The government may require workers across the country to increase working hours and take other more resolute measures. It is also possible that the term of office of members of the Chamber of Deputies may be extended. After the Premier finished speaking, the Chamber of Deputies immediately put the government's original proposal to a vote and finally passed it by a vote of 321 to 264. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the full powers bill was passed by the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee immediately submitted it for review in the afternoon of today and decided to submit it to the Senate for discussion in the afternoon. It is expected to pass and be established by a large majority. As for the measures that the government intends to take, there are two types: (1) Regarding the number of army personnel, after a large number of Spanish government soldiers fled to France, the French authorities continued to increase the number of troops stationed on the southern border to be responsible for surveillance. The defense of other places is therefore not without impact, so it is necessary to replenish the number of army personnel to compensate. (2) Regarding military equipment, the number of manufactured items is increased and various important raw materials are purchased in preparation for emergencies. In addition, the current wartime national organization law may also be amended so that various factories and their workers can be requisitioned when necessary. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">German Influence Continues Eastward, Soviet Union is Highly Concerned <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Romania Already Feels Threatened, Appeals to Allied Nations for Real Assistance</p>
<p>(Moscow) Last night, all sectors of the Soviet Union remained silent regarding possible actions the Soviet Union might take to respond to German pressure on Romania, awaiting official release of information on the matter. This silence does not indicate that the Soviet authorities do not take seriously any action that might bring their most dangerous enemy, Germany, closer to their borders. Well-informed sources believe that if Romania's integrity is threatened, the Soviet Union will have no choice but to deal with it with strong measures, especially because the Soviet Union's interests in Ukraine will be significantly affected. These strong measures may be similar to those used in the Sino-Japanese War. After Japan's invasion of China, the Soviet Union established friendly relations with China and provided material assistance. Stalin's remarks at the Communist Party Congress on March 10, stating that Germany's future expansionary actions would be westward, seem to indicate that Germany's recent actions have startled the Soviet Union. However, it must not be forgotten that the swallowing of Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement was already expected. In addition, another passage in Stalin's speech, stating, "We intend to provide assistance to countries that have suffered aggression and are fighting for national independence, and it is also worth looking back," is noteworthy. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Tonight, newspapers published news of Romania's deployment of troops. Although Romania's mobilization has not been officially acknowledged, the *Evening Standard* said that Bucharest had issued a mobilization order for five army corps. King Carol of Romania has stated to the British government that if Britain and France can provide assistance, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia can unanimously insist. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania. Although the official authorities here have solemnly denied the news about Germany's ultimatum to Romania, public opinion is still concerned about it. They believe that Germany's intention to gradually expand its influence in Romania can no longer be concealed. The approach of German troops to the Romanian border is enough to cause anxiety. Those in charge say that Romania must obtain the full assistance of its allies and friendly countries in order to negotiate with Germany on an equal footing. At the same time, public opinion in Yugoslavia, Poland, and even Bulgaria has changed, and all disapprove of Germany's actions. This is very comforting. The key to future events lies in seizing the opportunity and uniting with each other. What is unknowable is whether the Hungarian government will sacrifice its independence to serve Germany. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Prague, Czech Republic. Most of the German troops here have withdrawn and are reportedly moving eastward. Today, the Czech capital is quiet, and there have been no military impediments to transportation. However, planes soar through the sky all day long.

<p>British Foreign Secretary Strongly Advocates in Cabinet Meeting; Changing Times Force Britain to Shift Policy</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the cabinet meeting held this afternoon focused on the German threat to Romania. It approved Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham. Foreign Secretary Halifax also reported in detail on the Central European situation, taking into account the information sent from the capitals of Czechoslovakia, Germany, and Romania. He also explained the situation regarding the British government's protest to Germany and the recall of the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson. The cabinet immediately approved it. Foreign Secretary Halifax then expressed his opinion, advocating that a defensive line be formed from Poland, through Romania and Greece, to Turkey, to prevent Germany's continued eastward expansion. Although this proposal was opposed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon and several other cabinet members, Prime Minister Chamberlain and most of the cabinet members expressed their support. Once French President Lebrun comes to visit next week and the two sides conduct official talks, a firm decision can be made. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax also reported on his meetings with French Ambassador Corbin, Soviet Ambassador Maisky, German Ambassador Dirksen, and American Ambassador Kennedy. According to reports, Ambassador Maisky expressed his disappointment after the Munich Agreement, but if countries take collective action at this time to prevent Germany from expanding its influence, it should still be supported. When he later met with Ambassador Dirksen, he protested to him and informed him that the British government was determined to take the most resolute attitude. He then informed Ambassador Kennedy that the British government was gradually implementing a concrete policy of resisting aggression. According to general knowledge, the cabinet will discuss the military deployment commonly adopted in peacetime within the next week, and the issue of conscription should be included. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Today's newspapers paid great attention to Romania's request for British assistance after receiving Germany's economic ultimatum and the consequences of this move, and published terrifying descriptions of the European crisis. It also reported that a new line of great powers, led by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and supported by Poland, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia, has been proposed and is being discussed openly. According to several diplomatic correspondents, this proposal was discussed at the cabinet meeting last night, but no decision was made pending completion of consultations with the various dominions. In addition, there are many reports that the four great peace nations of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union may convene a meeting to discuss a common policy. The newspapers do not try to reveal Germany's current intentions, as they believe that this secret is tightly wrapped up between Hitler and his close advisors who met in Vienna last night. The newspapers everywhere remind the public that German troops are moving eastward and their destination is still unknown. According to the Warsaw correspondent of the *Sunday Times*, Poland and Hungary, which share a common border that Germany must pass through to advance into Romania, have begun political and military discussions. There are also reports that talks between the two countries will begin today. According to the diplomatic correspondent of the *Sunday Times*, Romanian Ambassador Tilea told British Foreign Secretary Halifax on Friday that 44 German divisions were partly in Czechoslovakia and the rest were mobilizing in Germany and were prepared to move eastward. Romanian opinion believes that even if Germany is preparing to attack Romania, this military action cannot be realized within ten days. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) According to observations from diplomatic circles in various countries here, Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham yesterday marked Britain's abandonment of its appeasement policy. It was a statement of Britain's past policies toward Germany, and a statement that British-German relations had returned to the same state they were on the eve of the outbreak of the Great War. In short, the British Prime Minister's speech was the biggest change in Britain's domestic and foreign policies since the Great War. In his speech, Mr. Chamberlain had already acknowledged that his appeasement policy had completely failed. Mr. Zhang's question about Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia being the first step in conquering the world by force was exactly the same as the various fears that Britain had about Germany on the eve of the Great War. The result of Germany's actions is to promote closer cooperation between Britain and France, which can be seen more clearly from French President Lebrun's visit to London on Tuesday. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Germany Submits</p>
<p>Economic Proposal to Romania</p>
<p>Reports in British Newspapers Confirmed to be Facts; Germany Denies Issuing Ultimatum</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the news that Germany has submitted an economic proposal to Romania, the diplomatic affairs correspondent of Havas has learned that the news carried by the *Times* day before yesterday is completely accurate, but it is slightly inaccurate to say that it was an ultimatum. The denial issued by Germany is intended to save face. According to reports, the *Times* has reported that Walter, a German economist, has made two demands to the Romanian government: (1) Romania should gradually abandon its industrial construction plan, successively close existing factories, and focus on developing agriculture; (2) Various products such as grains, oil, wood, and livestock can only be sold to Germany. If the above can be followed, Germany is prepared to guarantee Romania's territorial integrity and national independence. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Rumors that Germany has submitted an ultimatum to Romania have recently been denied by semi-official circles here, calling it unfounded and saying that the economic negotiations currently underway between Germany and Romania are only aimed at developing bilateral trade. The various rumors are intended to increase the tension of the international situation and should not be believed. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Also Denies Making Promises to Aid Romania; British and French Protests Rejected by Germany</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government has sent a note to the German government stating its non-recognition of Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia, saying: "The Soviet government cannot but regard the German military occupation of various provinces of Czechoslovakia and subsequent actions of the German government as autocratic, tyrannical, and aggressive. In the Soviet government's view, the German government's actions not only run counter to the elimination of dangers to universal peace, but also create and increase such dangers. The German government has undermined the political stability of Eastern Europe, increased the factors of alarm, and dealt a new blow to the sense of tranquility of the people of Central Europe." Regarding the rumor that Romania had received a concrete promise of Soviet assistance, qualified sources in the Soviet Union say that Romania had not requested aid from the Soviet Union, nor had the Soviet Union given any promises. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) An official communiqué was released this evening stating: "After the British and French ambassadors deemed the actions taken by Germany to restore peace and order in Bohemia and Moravia and to appease the situation in Central Europe as illegal and protested to the diplomatic authorities, the diplomatic authorities immediately replied separately, stating that this protest has no basis politically, legally, or even spiritually, and the German government finds it difficult to consider."

<p>Intends to Use Methods Against Hungary on Romania</p>
<p>Sufficient to Promote Unity of Democratic Front</p>
<p>(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that Foreign Secretary Halifax today discussed the situation arising from Romania's appeal for British aid to resist German economic demands with the ambassadors of France, the Soviet Union, the United States. It is heard that liaison between Britain and Romania has now been intensified, and Romania's determination to resist German aggression with all its strength has also been strengthened. The news obtained by London yesterday regarding German economic demands on Romania was originally what the Romanian side wished to publish, but the Romanian capital later denied it, presumably in the hope that Germany might change its position. Recalling that after the settlement of the Sudetenland issue last September, Germany made similar demands on Hungary, restricting it to being an agricultural country and limiting its military strength. Now that Germany has drawn Hungary into its economic sphere and placed the Hungarian army in an insignificant position, it is preparing to continue its steps to annex territories closer to Vienna, starting with the economy and then continuing with politics. It is believed that the British Cabinet will discuss Britain's attitude towards this and the results of the Foreign Secretary's contact with various diplomats this morning at its meeting this afternoon. Although the German side stated that the German Ambassador's meeting with the British Foreign Secretary was a routine matter, it is certain that the British Foreign Secretary took this opportunity to reiterate to the German Ambassador Britain's position that the occupation of Czechoslovakia cannot be regarded as legal. Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited the Foreign Office's chief diplomatic advisor, Vansittart, yesterday to discuss recent developments, and was later received by Foreign Secretary Halifax to exchange views. It is heard that the issue of mutual action was also raised during the talks. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>French President Accompanied by Foreign Minister Scheduled to Visit Britain</p>
<p>Jointly Discuss How to Cope with Overall Situation; Significance of This Trip is Significant</p>
<p>Brest Naval Port: President Lebrun is scheduled to travel to Britain on the 21st of this month aboard the "Côte d'Azur" mail ship to return the visit. At that time, he will be escorted by the second squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, which includes three destroyers and three torpedo boats. They left this port today, preparing to proceed via Cherbourg to Calais in northern France to await orders. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) President Lebrun is scheduled to lead Foreign Minister Bonnet to London on the 21st to return the invitation of King George VI of England. This trip is undoubtedly of great importance in the current international situation. Taking this opportunity, Foreign Minister Bonnet can hold detailed discussions with British Foreign Secretary Halifax on the general situation in Europe, and immediately discuss how to deal with Germany's threats to Romania and Hungary. Moreover, the harmonious relationship between the British and French nations is close and seamless, and this will be fully demonstrated. In addition, political figures have said that the protests made by Britain and France to the German government yesterday are not just empty words. This can be seen from the fact that Britain and France refuse to recognize the fait accompli and have each recalled their ambassadors to Germany to report on their duties. Furthermore, Britain and France are trying to approach the Soviet Union and Poland. Among them, France has already signed concrete and reliable treaties with these countries (referring to the Franco-Polish alliance treaty and the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty), and Britain intends to conduct economic negotiations with them to increase trade relations. This is the focus of the diplomatic policies of Britain and France. As for the most important issue at the moment, it is whether Italy will take advantage of the opportunity to make demands. Regarding this matter, France's position is very clear. Not only has it repeatedly made solemn statements, resolving not to give up an inch of land or its various rights, but also since the plenary powers bill was voted through by the Chamber of Deputies, the French government's position has become stable and it can deal with the difficult times with greater authority.

<p>(Rome) The famous journalist Gayda (known as Mussolini's spokesperson) recently published an article in the Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" commenting on the Czechoslovakian incident, briefly stating that this case will soon expand, "The democratic countries should take this incident as a warning and restore their offensive strength to strangle the survival needs of the totalitarian countries." As for Italy, it has never regarded the Munich Agreement as the "end point," and therefore does not find this incident strange. Gayda finally mentioned Italy's wishes for France, saying, "Even though Italy is peace-loving to this day, France still responds with a warlike and rigid attitude, which is quite wrong." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The attitude of Hungary and Italy towards recent events and the possibility of new German moves remains ambiguous. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Observer" made an interesting report, saying that Hitler had advised Mussolini not to demand the occupation of French territories from France at this time, but only to ask France to make concessions in Tunisia and reduce its sovereignty, and that he could follow Hitler's methods in the Sudetenland in the future.

<h3 id="e13">Germany Levies Punitive Taxes on Imports; United States Applies Economic Pressure on Germany <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Applicable to Japan and Other Treaty-Breaking Countries</p>
<p>Does Not Recognize German Annexation of Czechoslovakia as Legal; Will Take Parallel Actions with Britain, France, and Soviet Union</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government announced last night that, in retaliation for Germany's aggression in Europe and its attempts to use economic power to invade the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. government will impose a "punitive tax" on German imports. This tax will take effect on March 23rd. Congress expects that the government will also use such restrictive measures against Japan and other countries that violate treaties. The Treasury Department also announced that the government had notified Britain and France of the imposition of a "punitive tax" on German imports. The U.S. State Department yesterday condemned the Nazi Party in very sharp language and decided to retaliate against Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia. According to information revealed by Under Secretary of State Welles, the United States will send a note to Germany stating the American people's resentment of the Nazi Party's annexation of Czechoslovakia. It is expected that the note will express in clear and direct terms that the United States will definitely refuse to recognize Germany's seizure of Czechoslovakia as legal. Welles said that the note will respond to Berlin's official note regarding the Nazi Party's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia. The United States, Britain, and France are taking the same stance and will unanimously refuse to recognize Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia. However, regarding external reports that Britain intends to convene a four-power conference, including the three democratic countries and the Soviet Union, to plan to stop German aggression, Welles said he had heard nothing about it. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to news from here today, the "punitive tax" announced by the Treasury Department on German imports will, in addition to collecting ordinary higher tax rates, also levy 25% as a "punishment." Commercial experts say that this new tax may reduce the import of Nazi Party goods into the United States to a very low level. It is heard that the Treasury Department's announcement was based on the opinion of U.S. Comptroller General McCarl, who believes that Germany's subsidies for U.S. exports in order to exchange for U.S. cotton, reaching 33.33%, are very inappropriate. Recently, Germany has been implementing subsidies for general exporters due to its weak business. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, in his message to Congress on January 4th, said that apart from resorting to war, he intended to apply pressure to aggressor countries. Government officials recently declared that the U.S. government now intends to implement this pressure on Germany. The measures already decided include the following: (1) The various preferential treatments previously given by the United States to Czechoslovakia in commerce and finance will now be cancelled, and Germany will not be allowed to inherit these preferential treatments. (2) An additional 25% tax will be levied on German imports. In addition to these two measures, the U.S. will not recognize the new situation in Central Europe and believes that the Czech people's surrender is only a temporary situation. This expression by the United States contains the unofficial meaning of encouraging Czechoslovakia. After Under Secretary of State Welles made a formal declaration condemning Germany, Britain and France immediately issued similar statements and formally protested. Such parallel actions by the three countries will certainly strengthen President Roosevelt's position, which is indeed a very gratifying phenomenon. More generally, the international situation has undergone profound changes. The appeasement policy towards the European situation has also ceased to be implemented after Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham. Peace-loving countries must have realized that the only way to stop Germany from continuing to annex territories in Europe is to rely on force. Especially since Germany's actions are not yet its main stage, because its desires do not stop there, the current situation is unlikely to be stabilized from this point on. The U.S. government, regardless of the opposition of isolationists, resolutely demanded the amendment of the current Neutrality Act to strengthen the resistance of democratic countries. This is why. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Assistant Secretary of State Welles stated today that there is no basis for speculation that the United States will join Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss containing aggression. The official notification from Germany last night regarding its coup d'état in Central Europe was sent to the United States. The State Department intends to publish the notes exchanged between the United States and Germany to clarify the official position of the United States. U.S. Minister to Czechoslovakia, Carr, is still in office. A decision on Carr's status is expected to be announced within a few days. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Pittman to Propose Amendment to Neutrality Act <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Belligerents Purchase Arms from the United States; Transaction to be Based on Cash</p>
<p>(Washington) Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman is scheduled to submit a new legislative bill to the Senate on the 20th of this month, advocating the repeal of the current Neutrality Act and authorizing the President to (1) designate belligerents within 30 days of the outbreak of war, (2) once belligerents are designated, U.S. merchant ships shall not load goods to be transported to those countries, (3) all belligerents may purchase various items from the United States, including weapons, but must purchase them with cash and transport them themselves, (4) prohibiting loans or credits to belligerents, (5) the above provisions shall not apply to any American countries that do not participate in wars outside of the Americas. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman announced that he would propose an amendment to the U.S. current Neutrality Act in Congress, it is generally expected here that the United States will increase its economic pressure and unfriendly economic actions on dictatorial countries. Pittman's amendment will give the U.S. President broader discretionary power to sell arms to "countries that should go to war and countries that should not go to war," and transactions will be based on cash. According to Pittman, if this case can be established, there is no need for the President to declare the existence of a state of war for the Sino-Japanese War; this law can automatically apply. The case stipulates that "regardless of whether or not declaration procedures have been followed, the President may declare a list of countries involved in the war after 30 days of war and apply the cash transaction method." According to Pittman, the UK will definitely benefit more from this method. (AP, 19th)</p>
<p>New Neutrality Act Contains Four Key Points</p>
<p>(Washington) In addition to what is seen in another telegram, the main points of the Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Pittman are as follows: This case also advocates authorizing the President to prohibit U.S. citizens and all ships from going to specially designated war zones after the outbreak of war, but with several provisos to facilitate Red Cross relief work. Pittman recently gave a speech saying that there are four key points to the bill he drafted: (1) It does not apply to foreign civil wars. If Congress can vote on this case before the end of the Spanish Civil War, the measure prohibiting the transport of arms to Spain will naturally be withdrawn. (2) Countries that do not have large-scale arms factories can purchase weapons from the United States during wartime. The unfairness of the current Neutrality Act is thus corrected. (3) The advantages actually occupied by major naval powers are thus determined. (4) U.S. private arms factories can develop more easily, which is inherently beneficial to national defense. (5) The foreign sales channels of U.S. weapons can be preserved. A certain congressman proposed a motion to simply abolish the current Neutrality Act. He believes that although this law is incomplete, the issue of national neutrality should be governed by appropriate provisions, and he therefore proposed this amendment based on his limited knowledge. It is not authorized by the government. Political figures recently commented that Pittman's case is indeed part of the government's plan. Its main purpose is to give President Roosevelt greater freedom of action so that he can easily assist the democratic countries in the event of war in Europe. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>U.S. Gives Moral Support to Czech Minister</p>
<p>(Washington) According to responsible sources, the U.S. State Department will refuse to assist the German Embassy in taking over the Czech Embassy. The U.S. government will give "full moral support" to the Czech Minister to the U.S., Hurban, in his struggle to prevent the Germans from occupying the Czech Embassy's property. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>German Troops Parade in Prague</p>
<p>Czech People's Hearts Not Dead; Puppet Leader Embarrassed to Participate</p>
<p>Prague: German army troops paraded in the city this morning, lasting two hours. Only Germans watched, while most Czechs avoided going to the countryside and took down the national flags that they were ordered to hang to express their protest. However, various important officials of the Czech government, such as Prime Minister Beran, Defense Minister Syrový, and Foreign Minister Chvalkovský, were ordered by the German authorities to participate in the parade.

<p>Alas, Czechoslovakia, Many Suicides Under Foreign Rule</p>
<p>National Subjugation Education Being Implemented Within the Country</p>
<p>Prague: Suicide cases are increasing daily here. The famous surgeon Medill and his wife committed suicide by taking medicine on the day the German troops entered the city. Twenty Jews who attempted suicide and were hospitalized include a senior court official and a bank president. Another person fell from the top of the wireless radio station and died. According to news from Bratislava, the German Ministry of Education has decided that Slovak children will henceforth be given education suitable for the spirit of the Nazi Party. From May onwards, elementary school teachers will generally be replaced by Aryans. Images of the late leader of the Slovak National Party, Father Hlinka, and Hitler must be placed in the schools, and Nazi salutes must be forcibly performed. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Ukrainian Militia Resists Hungarian Army</p>
<p>Fighting Very Fierce</p>
<p>Making the Invaders Pay an Appropriate Price</p>
<p>Sighetu Marmației, Romania: Near Pokrovsk in Ruthenia, the most intense war between Ukrainian and Hungarian troops occurred this morning. The Ukrainian militia fought very hard. The Hungarian side had no choice but to send reinforcements from Tyachiv. This morning at 4:30 AM, the Ukrainian militia retreated, and 350 people entered Romania and were detained. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: Prime Minister Voloshyn of Carpatho-Ukraine left Cluj yesterday morning, heading for Yugoslavia. Before leaving, he told reporters, "I believe that the Carpatho-Ukraine issue cannot be resolved immediately. The Ukrainian people will definitely struggle. Although I do not know whether the Hungarian army has occupied the entire province of Carpatho-Ukraine, I am convinced that the 'Sich' defense organization will do its best to resist, so that the invaders must also pay an appropriate price." According to people close to Voloshyn, Voloshyn may travel to London after arriving in Yugoslavia. (Haitong, 19th)</p>
<p>Germany Manufactures Puppets in Slovakia</p>
<p>Two Sides Have Signed Agreement; Recognize Slovakia as Independent State</p>
<p>Bratislava: German political figures invited Slovak political leaders Tiso, Tuka, and others to Vienna yesterday to discuss the constitutional status of the Slovak state until 3:00 AM. (Haitong, 19th)</p>
<p>Bratislava: It is heard that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has signed an agreement with Slovak Foreign Minister Ďurčanský, formally recognizing the state as an independent state. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The official side has yet to announce anything about the relationship between Germany and the Slovak state. As far as is generally known, the German government's annexation of Bohemia and Moravia has caused resentment abroad. As a remedy, it intends to allow the Slovak state authorities to declare their relationship with Germany under complete sovereignty and pressure the state authorities to accept this proposal, but it has been opposed. The reason why Führer Hitler refused to meet with Slovak Prime Minister Tiso and others in Vienna a few days ago is probably because of this. Authoritative observers here recently commented that Germany originally wanted to make the Slovak state a protectorate, but it did not want to declare it itself, and wanted to shift this responsibility to the state authorities. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Germany Newly Establishes Air Force Brigade</p>
<p>Headquarters in Vienna</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Germany merged the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, German Air Force Minister General Göring issued an order to establish the Fourth Brigade of the Air Force. The German Air Force's establishment has only had three brigades. The headquarters of the Fourth Air Force Team is located in Vienna, and its jurisdiction includes Ostmark (formerly Austria), Bohemia, Moravia, part of the Sudetenland, and Upper Silesia. General Löhr will serve as the brigade commander of the Fourth Team. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>German Action Second Step</p>
<p>British Newspaper's Speculation</p>
<p>Greenwich: "The Greenwich Time" reported today that Germany will send an ultimatum to France in the near future, demanding the return of pre-war colonies and demanding the return of sovereignty over Alsace-Lorraine. The newspaper also predicted that Germany would quickly strengthen its defenses in the east and make slight changes to most Czech fortresses or forts to make them sufficient as Germany's new defense lines. Military figures in democratic countries are currently paying close attention to Germany's second decision. (AP, 19th)</p>
<p>South African Federation Emergency Preparedness</p>
<p>Preventing German Disruption</p>
<p>Johannesburg, South Africa: The South African Federation is now implementing a large-scale preparedness plan to protect transportation and important public services. The authorities took this action because the German side's note to South Africa stated that if South Africa still does not allow Germans to enter the country, the German side will not be responsible for the consequences, etc. Three South African Air Force teams are preparing everything, and their base is located on the Witwatersrand. All police and air force reserves have been called up. Power plants, radio stations, telegraph bureaus, and gasoline stations have been defended. German workers in the Pretoria steel plant rioted yesterday and were suppressed by troops dispatched from the Witwatersrand. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">The Campaign Slogs On Without Success, and Friction Intensifies: Conflict Between Japanese Naval and Army Forces in Guangdong <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Yokohama Specie Bank Suffers Huge Losses</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: According to military sources in Huiyang, the Potian Brigade from Taiwan recently appeared between Dongguan, Taiping, and Chashan. The Japanese troops from Shilong, after withdrawing on the 8th, suddenly turned back and reinforced with two additional regiments, establishing strongholds in Futian, Zhengguo, Changping, and Shitan, with the intention of attacking Luofu Mountain again. The Japanese army has been invading Guangzhou for five months, but the campaign slogs on without success. The naval and army forces have different strategies and compete for leadership, leading to intensified friction. The "Good Citizen Certificates" issued by the Japanese army are not recognized in the tributaries of the Pearl River. From Humen Taiping to Huangpu, Nantoutou, and the south of Henan, the area is under naval control. People carrying cloth-based Good Citizen Certificates are often seen having them torn up by the Japanese navy. The Japanese army is now using wooden Good Citizen Certificates to prevent the navy from tearing them up. Naval plainclothes personnel entering and leaving the urban areas are also often bullied. Taiwanese and Korean soldiers can only lower their heads and suffer in silence, not daring to argue. At noon on the 6th, more than ten marines from the Tajima landing force disembarked at Nantoutou and marched into Guangzhou city, clashing with army sentries. Gunfire erupted immediately, causing great chaos in the city. Criminals took the opportunity to loot. It is reported that Yokohama Specie Bank lost more than 200,000 yuan in banknotes, and there were many casualties. (March 10th)</p>
<p>Ms. Sterling Speaks</p>
<p>The People of Guangxi Province Are Filled with Patriotic Fervor</p>
<p>The Government Does Its Best to Care for Refugees</p>
<p>Continental Daily News reports that Ms. Sterling, of the Southern Baptist Church, who has just arrived in Shanghai from Guilin, told reporters yesterday (the 18th) that the Guangxi Provincial Government has achieved remarkable results in handling the heavy burden caused by the war and does not attempt to shift its responsibility to others. Although refugees are pouring into Guilin from all directions, the provincial government is taking care of them in a systematic way. Although I have not witnessed it myself, I have heard that registration offices have been set up every ten li along major transportation routes. Refugees fill in their names at the registration offices, and the authorities provide free transportation to the extremely poor and give them three dimes in silver each day. In the past two months, frequent morning rains have prevented Guilin from being bombed by Japanese planes. During this period, although several air raid alerts were heard, no bombs were dropped. Whenever the air raid sirens sounded, a rare spectacle occurred: the 200,000 residents of Guilin climbed the specially built steps, crossed the city walls, and went to the stone caves in the nearby mountains for temporary shelter. During the air raid alerts, although all civilians evacuated, the police remained at their posts. If a house was hit by a bomb, the local police would guard the property until the homeowner returned home. If someone's residence was destroyed, the authorities would provide some public buildings for them to live in until they could build a new house. After the outbreak of the war, the daily routine has changed. Due to the risk of air raids in the morning, business must be conducted between 3:00 PM and midnight. Although there have been no air raids in the past two months, there have been bombings before, and half of the houses in the city have been destroyed. As for industrial cooperatives, none have been established in Guilin yet, but preliminary investigations are underway. Commerce in Guilin seems quite prosperous. People everywhere are preparing to resist the Japanese army, and signs of military activity can be seen everywhere. The Friends of Wounded Soldiers Association, a group that helps wounded soldiers, is carrying out arduous tasks in Guilin.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>Closing in on Huaiyin</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting at Zhaoguan Dam</p>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese army has decided to launch a large-scale invasion of northern Jiangsu and has successively invaded the counties of Huai, Si, Fu, and Bao. Except for the fact that the Chinese troops recovered Suijing quickly, so losses were relatively minor, the losses in other places such as Siyang, Lianshui, Donghai, Muyang, Funing, Huaiyin, and Huaian were very heavy. According to an investigation, although most of the residents of Huaiyin had been evacuated before it was abandoned and public utilities had been destroyed, the Japanese army looted miscellaneous items from the people after capturing the city and transported away more than 200 boxes. More than 200 civilians were shot dead, and countless rapes occurred. Furthermore, Funing was heavily bombed by Japanese planes, and after they briefly invaded the county seat, most of the houses in the city were reduced to ashes, and countless residents were massacred. The county was recovered by Chinese troops the day before yesterday, and efforts are being made to appease the local people. The other counties also suffered severely from looting, and the situation is still under investigation. Huaiyin and Haizhou are now under siege and counterattack by a new force of Chinese troops and armed civilians, and the fighting is extremely intense. There is a rumor that the county seat of Huaiyin has already been recovered by Chinese troops. Also, more than 200 Japanese soldiers from Shaobo lightly attacked the Chinese army's Zhaoguan Dam position at noon on the 10th, with heavy artillery fire. The Chinese defenders bravely resisted, and after fierce fighting until the afternoon, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. Dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed and many were wounded in this battle, and a large number of bullets were consumed. The Chinese side suffered no significant losses, and the Chen position remained as solid as a rock. On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese army used six trucks to transport wounded Japanese soldiers and corpses from Shaobo to Yangzhou. On the morning of the 12th, Japanese troops at Huangjue Bridge in Xishan, Yangzhou, had contact with Chinese guerrillas. On the morning of the 13th, there was also artillery fire in the southwest of Yangzhou. It is reported that the Doujia Bridge was raided by Chinese troops, and the Japanese army also suffered casualties.</p>
<p>Desolate Scene in Suqian</p>
<p>No Commerce Within the City</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Suqian fell on November 22nd last year. On December 2nd and 3rd, the Chinese army counterattacked the city, causing heavy losses to the Japanese army in terms of manpower and equipment, but failed to recover it. Since then, no counterattack has been launched, but the Chinese army is still within five miles northeast of the city (as of February 27th). Most of the Chinese troops are on the east bank of the Grand Canal, while Suqian is on the west bank. The Chinese troops in the vicinity include various units such as the Central Army, the Jiangsu Provincial Army, and guerrillas. Their artillery and mechanized equipment are not sufficient for an offensive, but they have shown astonishing strength in defense. The 57th Division is generally considered to be the best trained and equipped among the troops in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Although Suqian has been lost</p>
<p>for three months, the city is still on the front line. Anyone with experience knows what this means. The city gates of Suqian's outer city are heavily guarded, and no one is allowed to enter or leave. Moreover, in some respects, the regulations are now stricter than before. Those with "Good Citizen Certificates" were once allowed to enter and leave, but even they have not been allowed to enter or leave freely for several weeks. Every five days, those with "Good Citizen Certificates" can enter the city, but under no circumstances can they leave again. Unless some changes occur, they are virtually prisoners. At the beginning of Suqian's fall, American expatriates could enter and leave the city gates, but now they cannot. Since the establishment of the local puppet regime, the five American missionaries in Suqian have lived in houses outside the south side of the city, establishing a refugee camp. The entrance of the house is only sixty yards from the south city gate. A machine gun nest is built close to the house, so the house is surrounded on three sides. Every night, the Japanese army shoots aimlessly and incessantly, to intimidate the Chinese troops who are patrolling or operating in the suburbs. The artillery inside the city also often</p>
<p>Opens Fire in Response</p>
<p>and randomly throws grenades everywhere. Anyone who complains about the sounds of Shanghai at night can try sleeping in this house for one night. The refugee camp once housed seven or eight hundred people, including hospital employees. Currently, there are fewer than six hundred people. Most of the refugees buy their own food to cook, and those who are penniless receive free food twice a day. So far, the supply of food and fuel has not been completely interrupted, but fuel was once scarce and expensive. It is probably unnecessary to elaborate on the general business situation, which is extremely bad. Since the fall of Suqian, no one in the city is engaged in any kind of commerce. Recently, a Korean person opened a store selling sugar, beer, cigarettes, and canned goods. Some Chinese merchants have transported most of their goods from the city to villages and towns to avoid air raids. Now some of these goods are sold in the villages, towns, and local markets. Trade in local products is quite prosperous in some small town markets. Imported goods are becoming increasingly scarce. Homes are destroyed, families are scattered, and there are many grieving people. It is undoubtedly a tragic period in recent history.</p>
<p>Li Bai's Wartime History</p>
<p>He Achieved Merit Early in His Military Career</p>
<p>Interview with Zhang Guoquan</p>
<p>Among the military and political personnel of Guangxi, no one does not know "Teacher Zhang." He is from Yangshuo and was a teacher of Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, Huang Shaohong, and others in their youth. Even now, they still call him "Teacher Zhang." Therefore, everyone also calls him "Teacher Zhang" instead of his name. Perhaps he is the only surviving teacher of these four gentlemen, and I did not want to miss the opportunity to interview him. Teacher Zhang's residence is on Xianqian Street, less than fifty steps from the county government. It faces east and is a stone-lintelled house with two bays, which looks newly built. A robust child handed in my business card. I initially thought he was Teacher Zhang's grandson, but later learned that he was his only beloved son. After a moment, a servant brought out tea and cigarettes. Then "Teacher Zhang," wearing a dark gray silk wide robe and a pair of cloth shoes, came out from the inner building to meet me. Although he was already fifty-six years old, he had not yet grown a beard and looked at least ten years younger than his age. His steady gait and firm handshake showed that he had a youthful period in military life. I first expressed my greetings and explained the purpose of my visit. Teacher Zhang graduated from the first class of the Baoding Xiehe Class, the predecessor of the Baoding Military Academy, at the end of the Qing Dynasty. The Governor-General was Duan Qirui, and the Superintendent was Qu Tongfeng. There were infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, and transport departments, and the course lasted two and a half years. After the second class of the Xiehe Class graduated, it was renamed the Baoding Military Academy. During the reign of Emperor Xuantong, he graduated from the Japanese Military Academy and returned to China with Cai Songpo from Yunnan, Zhuang Yunkuan from Jiangsu, and others. He founded the Army Elementary School in Guilin, Guangxi. Li Bai and the two Huangs were the first students of this elementary school. At that time, these "distinguished students" were only teenagers, but among the more than one hundred students, he felt that they were "endowed with great talent" and "diligent in learning." "I am not saying this now because they are all in prominent positions. I am not trying to flatter them or boast," Teacher Zhang said. "De Lin and Jian Sheng are indeed astute and courageous. In the early years of the Republic of China, I led troops, and De Lin served as a company commander under me. Once during a battle in Hunan, his cheek was pierced by a bullet. I told him to withdraw, but he persisted until the task was completed before leaving the battlefield. After he recovered, a battalion commander position happened to be vacant, so I promoted him. Jian Sheng, while suppressing bandits in southern Guangxi Province, unfortunately broke his leg. Although he was sent to Guangdong for treatment and recovered, he still limps somewhat when walking. His decisiveness was evident from a young age." He said that he was originally a member of the proletariat, and the new house he now lives in was built for him last year by these "classmates." He used to live in Hong Kong and often goes to Guilin after returning to his hometown. "I either stay at Li's house or eat at Bai's house." He is truly a respectable teacher. On the evening of the very day I interviewed him, Teacher Zhang actually walked along the muddy village road to the Lequn Society to return my visit, which I found to be an honor I did not deserve. That evening, he was wearing a leather hat and holding a copper-tipped bamboo dry tobacco pipe, showing some signs of age, but he was in high spirits. He spoke a lot about the customs and local conditions of Yangshuo. It was already dark when he left. He smiled and said, "After you come to Yangshuo for fun, you should pay us some taxes." I also smiled and said, "Alright then!" He said, "Please write more articles in the newspapers to attract more tourists to our local area." I wanted to send him back, but he insisted on refusing, saying, "In my own home, everyone should lead the way." I had no choice but to give up. Zhang also inscribed the words "National Golden Voice" for this newspaper. Teacher Zhang's name is Guoquan, and his courtesy name is Zhenou. He is currently a lieutenant general参军 in the Fifth Route Army Headquarters. He often makes suggestions on military planning to Li Bai, which are often adopted. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Donghua Lost to French Business School 2-3 Yesterday, But Still Won the First Division Runner-Up <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Second Round of Competition Results Do Not Count, and the Venue Is Closed Early, Ending the Season Ahead of Schedule</p>
<p>In yesterday's Western League First Division soccer game, Donghua lost to the French Business School 2-3 at the Yiyuan, but Donghua has already won the First Division runner-up. The outcome of yesterday's game was irrelevant. The reason is as follows: The Yiyuan Stadium needs to be resurfaced with grass, so the decision was made to close early. The lease on the racecourse will also expire soon, so the venue situation has become a serious problem. The Western League soccer competition will therefore end early. According to news from the Western League, it has been confirmed that yesterday's First Division league game between Donghua and the French Business School at Yiyuan was the final act. The rankings of all teams will be calculated according to the first round. The other reserve, second, and third divisions will also be completed within two weeks. As for the cup competition, only one game remains in the junior cup final, which will be decided on Thursday (the 23rd). Since the rankings are calculated according to the first round results, Donghua's runner-up position is secure. In yesterday's game, Donghua initially had an advantage, taking a 2-1 lead, but in the second half, they collapsed. In the end, they lost 3-2. There were only a thousand or so spectators.</p>
<p>Wan Jin Scores First; Huang Mao Arrives Late. The French Business School only had ten players to start the game. Both sides attacked and defended, but there was no tension. Wan Jin crossed the ball, and Ade, Shiyan, and Youliang made several passes, but they were blocked for a corner kick. Youliang took the corner, and Ade headed the ball, but the old man, Raymond, caught it cleanly. Xianghua shot at the goal, but it lacked power, and Raymond caught it again. Then Wan Jin received a pass from Shu Shigeng and shot, but it was caught again. After fourteen minutes, Aja passed to Dai, Dai passed to Xianghua, and Xianghua immediately passed to Wan Jin. He kicked with his left foot, hitting the left corner perfectly.</p>
<p>Donghua Takes the Lead. After going up 1-0, Huang Mao had not yet arrived. It was not until twenty-three minutes that he finally arrived late. Donghua's offense remained strong. After a short pause, Bao Xiu shot fiercely. Qin BiGao did not catch it, but fortunately it hit outside the net. Aja and Shiyan passed to each other skillfully and went deep into the enemy's formation, sending the ball to the center, less than seven yards from the goal. Azae was sure to score, but it went wide, and Raymond panicked and swiped at it, resulting in a corner kick. After the corner kick, Xian Jielun fouled at twenty yards, and Ade took the free kick, but it was ineffective. Cai Shengsen intercepted the ball and passed to Youliang. He shot fiercely from fifteen yards and scored. The score was recorded at thirty-six minutes, and Donghua had an absolute advantage of 2-0. The French Business School then changed its formation, with Jiesu and Niubao switching positions. Then Huang Mao tried a fifty-yard dash. Fortunately, Qin BiGao recovered from his mistake and prevented an own goal. But at forty-two minutes, Hua Te lofted a shot from twelve yards, and the first half ended 2-1.</p>
<p>Losing Two Goals in a Row. After the lemon (halftime), Qin BiGao caught Jiem's shot. Huang Mao tried another dash, Qin could not help but panic, losing control and fumbling. Although it was saved, the morale was affected. Shen, Dai, and Jia made a beautiful series of passes, and Ade shot, but the old man saved it again. At nineteen minutes, Zhuang Youren attempted a back heel, but slipped. Then Bao Xiu rushed over, and from three yards, he swept the ball horizontally. Qin BiGao watched the ball go in, unable to save it. The score was tied 2-2. After that, Donghua was in danger repeatedly, but the front line did not lose heart and continued to launch sharp attacks. At thirty minutes, Bao Xiu shot powerfully and beautifully, and Qin BiGao blocked it into a corner kick. Meng Nuotuo took the corner, and Jiem scored with one kick. The French Business School came from behind to win 3-2. At forty minutes, Zhuang Youren rushed out and passed to Cai, who immediately passed to Wan Jin. There was no enemy defender in front, and the opportunity was very good, but he touched it too far, and no one was there to receive it. Thus, Donghua suffered a defeat in a winnable situation, which is deeply regrettable.</p>

<p>Lost to West Captors 1-4, Final Battle to Decide the Championship</p>
<p>Donghua soccer team had six wins in six games in the Western League Reserve Division, and it seemed that the championship was already in their grasp. Yesterday, they faced West Captors at Jiaozhou Park in the second-to-last game. Because many players were absent, they were replaced by First Division players who had just played a strenuous game in the morning, so they were defeated. After the game started, Donghua was penalized with a penalty kick, which Zhuo Lunzifu scored. At fifteen minutes, Gao Baozheng shot and scored, making it 1-1. The first half ended in a draw. Only two minutes after the start of the second half, Ade's penalty kick was saved, and Youliang also shot many times but did not score. At twenty-two minutes, Clark headed the ball in, making it 2-1. In the last three minutes, Clark and Oakley each scored, and Donghua was defeated 4-1. The current situation in the Reserve Division is that West Fords and West Captors are tied for first place with six wins, one draw, and one loss each, for a total of thirteen points. Donghua is in second place with six wins and one loss in seven games, for a total of twelve points. They still have one game against St. Francis, and if they win, they will still be the champion. If they draw, they will share the title with West Fords and West Captors.</p>

<p>Hui Zhen Wins Second Place, Individual Champion Wang Zheng Lin's 5,000-Meter Time is 17 Minutes 18 Seconds</p>
<p>The 2nd Minkuang Cup Open Cross-Country Championship, organized by Minkuang Middle School, started yesterday morning in the chilly spring air in front of the school gate on Jiaozhou Road. A total of fourteen teams participated in this year's event, with 129 athletes. However, 25 people were absent yesterday morning, so the actual number of participants was 104. The entire course was 5,000 meters long. As a result of the competition, Lido once again displayed its prowess. Because the entire team was well-staffed, they won the championship with a score of 41. Wang Zheng Lin of that team won the individual first place with a record of 17 minutes and 18 seconds, retaining the double championship. Hui Zhen team took second place with 44 points, a difference of only three points. The intensity of the competition at the time was evident. Awards were given on the spot after the race.</p>
<p>Race Progression: At 8:00 AM, elite troops from all sides set off. Guan Youwen took the lead, with Zhang Liang, Wang Shiying and others advancing in formation. Wang Zheng Lin was in the back of the pack. After passing Hart Road, Wang Zheng Lin overtook Guan Youwen, with Ling Xuewen on his right. Guan Youwen ran side by side with Liu Guangfa. At that time, the front was entirely dominated by elites from the Lido and Hui Zhen teams. Turning into Gordon Road, Ling Xuewen gradually weakened, and Liu Guangfa moved up to second place. When arriving at the Yufosi (Jade Buddha Temple) Binlang Road, Guan Youwen was more than 30 meters behind. Wang and Liu Guangfa still led proudly. Arriving at the intersection of Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road, about 1,500 meters from the finish line, Wang Zheng Lin rose up with divine power, and Liu Guangfa gradually weakened. At Connaught Road, Wang Zheng Lin was still in the lead, and Liu Guangfa was already falling behind. With the finish line in sight, Old Wang calmly and unhurriedly reached the finish line first amidst thousands of applauses. Liu Guangfa finished second, 60 meters behind. Guan Youwen finished third, another 80 meters behind. Xu Peigong and Ling Xuewen fought hard at the end, finishing fourth and fifth respectively.</p>

<p>(Jinhua Correspondence) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, after investigating the fact that people's lives have been difficult since the War of Resistance, and they cannot afford to pay for their children's education, and the situation of young people dropping out of school is becoming increasingly serious, in order to relieve those who have dropped out of school, it was decided last year that all provincial schools would be exempt from tuition fees starting from the first semester of the 27th year. Now, within the budget of the provincial education and culture expenses for the 28th year, the number of publicly funded spots will be increased so that poor students can benefit more. The department has now made overall arrangements, and starting from this semester, the number of publicly funded and tuition-free spots for new students in specialized, high school, and junior high school programs will be increased to account for 14% of the class size, that is, 7 publicly funded and 7 tuition-free students per class of 50 people. For continuing students, a maximum of 2 additional students may be added to each category per class. The number of publicly funded spots for normal school and vocational students will be increased to account for 18% of the class size for new students, that is, 9 publicly funded students per class of 50 people, and a maximum of 4 additional students may be added to each category per class for continuing students. Except for the affiliated elementary school part, special orders are issued to each school to understand the government's purpose of awarding and assisting poor and outstanding students, and to properly handle it to benefit the impoverished.</p>

<h3 id="e31">The Crystallization of Love as the Key to Maintaining Marital Affection <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Those who do not experience the love of women after marriage today inevitably lack the inherent charm of men and have physiological defects, especially the loss of the reproductive function, which is most important. The relationship between husband and wife is that the husband loves his wife, and the wife receives the husband's love. Therefore, the harmony between the two allows the family to maintain peace and happiness. Although the wife is passively loved by the husband, once she becomes a mother, she immediately reverses course and becomes an active lover, because her child is weaker and inferior to herself. Therefore, at this time, a woman has two qualifications: she is passively loved by her husband and actively loves her child. She even extends her love to her husband. Therefore, although the love between husband and wife may gradually fade over time, the wife can still maintain the peace of the family with tenderness and affection once there is a crystallization of love. It is no coincidence that people call women those who are born in love and die in love. Observing from this point, people who self-indulge before marriage and those who indulge in sex after marriage often lose their reproductive functions, and cannot be loved by their spouse or produce offspring, trapping their wives in the loneliness of a desert, eventually leading to emotional breakdown and the loss of all happiness!</p>
<p>According to physiological analysis, the presence or absence of offspring requires examination of whether the reproductive function is diseased. If the reproductive function suffers from disease, premature ejaculation and impotence will not only erupt one by one, but the patient's life will also be in imminent danger. However, according to my many years of experience in treating the above-mentioned conditions, if youth gland extracts can be actively used to treat the condition, they can often start to bring back youth. For example, the genuine and powerful animal youth gland extract preparation for men "Bu Ti Kang" invented by German Dr. Mellen is made based on the above principle. Therefore, after taking it, the reproductive function returns to health, the mind feels particularly refreshed, and the spirit is exceptionally invigorated. All previous symptoms such as impotence, premature ejaculation, neurasthenia, and incomplete development are thoroughly eliminated. Therefore, it is praised by Chinese and foreign physicians, who are happy to recommend it to patients. Why does "Bu Ti Kang" have this rejuvenating effect? It is because the main component of this preparation is extracted from animal testicular essence. Using animal testicular essence to supplement the deficiency of human essence is no wonder it has a significant effect. It also contains brain-boosting phosphorus, which can supplement the brain and strengthen the mind. However, when purchasing, it is necessary to specify this kind of medicine, because miscellaneous brands do not have this kind of great medicinal power.</p>
<p>As for the female "Bu Ti Kang", it is the best of the ovarian endocrine agents. Those who have irregular menstruation, withered breasts, infertility after marriage, and symptoms of frigidity can be cured after taking it.</p>

<h3 id="e32">The Prerequisite for Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine in the United States</p>
<p>Eradicating Gonococci is the Prerequisite for Eliminating Gonorrheal Toxin</p>
<p>What Medicine Can Take on This Important Responsibility of Expelling Gonorrhea?</p>
<p>To study the method of fundamentally eradicating gonorrhea, we must first understand the life of the pathogenic bacteria of gonorrhea. Regarding this level, Dr. Peter, the German master of gonorrhea, has the most insights. He spent more than thirty years of painstaking effort, and finally invented the medicine "Kelin Nong" made by mixing protein body yellow pigment and other substances. The characteristic of this medicine is that after taking it, it can generate an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect in the shortest time, that is, it reaches the lesion directly from the blood very quickly, surrounds and annihilates all the gonococci, so that the cunning gonococci have nowhere to escape. Therefore, gonorrhea patients, whether at the beginning or accidentally taking inferior medicines on the market, which causes vicious symptoms, can take German "Kelin Nong" to save themselves. It can indeed be completely cured in four or five weeks.</p>
<p>Before "Kelin Nong" was invented, governments around the world raised the banner of eradicating gonococci and promoted it to the world, but in terms of results, 9 out of 10 were failures. Although there was a heavy reward, there were still no brave men. However, Westerners, after such encouragement and promotion by their own governments, all medical scientists immersed themselves in diligent research, and the research results of German gonorrhea scholar Dr. Peter were even more amazing, because with the above-mentioned effects of "Kelin Nong," gonococci naturally no longer had the ability to resist. They could only be completely subdued by "Kelin Nong" and completely eliminated. This is indeed an unprecedented miracle in the treatment of gonorrhea, which is very different from today's general chemical therapy, membrane-penetrating sterilization therapy, and preparations such as sandalwood oil and cubeb. Because these over-the-counter drugs have strong medicinal properties and large side effects, the gains do not outweigh the losses. Therefore, governments of various countries have given Dr. Peter huge bonuses to reward his hard work in invention. In the case of all gonorrhea, there is no hope of fundamental cure without taking "Kelin Nong." In terms of external medicines, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Carols Shendi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. Both can be treated at home by following the diagrams and instructions, which is especially effective.</p>

<p>— Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine in Germany</p>
<p>Patient Yan Youkang, 25 years old, from Le'an County, Jiangxi Province, (self-report) - Likes to pursue pleasure, and committed masturbation at the age of 17. After three years, the body gradually deteriorated, and nocturnal emission was frequent. He asked Chinese and Western doctors for treatment, and took more than ten doses of medicine, but saw no effect. After getting married at the age of 21, he often suffered from premature ejaculation. Due to life circumstances, he was busy all day long, and his mind was full of complex thoughts every day, so he had no time to seek medical attention, which led to dizziness and inability to work. He begs for treatment. (Symptoms) - Nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation, seminal fluid slips out after urination, memory loss, headache, easy excitement and fatigue, severe sleep disorders, palpitations, tinnitus, and back pain. Weight at the time of diagnosis was 97 pounds. (Treatment Method) - Ordered him to take good care of himself, abstain from sex in the short term, avoid physical overwork, pay attention to urination before going to bed, rub the area with cold water, take "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to calm the brain and consolidate the sperm gate to stop nocturnal emission, and administer a large amount of testicular essence preparation "Bu Ti Kang" for men to treat various weaknesses caused by nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. One month later, the headache was cured and the spirit was lifted, and the back pain was gone. After taking it for two months, all symptoms disappeared and there was no premature ejaculation.</p>

<p>According to Aubry's view, soft infiltration of the posterior urethra due to gonorrhea is mostly due to uric acid, urinary sediment of phosphate, or excessive sexual activity, or excessive masturbation. It is also often seen in patients with genital tuberculosis. In addition, it is even more common in Atonie der Biase, mucosal catarrah with bleeding easily seen in Bestbarn. In terms of the distribution of inflammation, the prostate part around the internal sphincter is invaded by inflammation, but the membranous part is the closest to the entrance of the inflammatory invasion. If this situation is examined with a urethroscope, it can be completely and clearly treated. Therefore, doctors must pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>For posterior urethritis, the future changes of the disease are often unpredictable. Therefore, doctors must quickly and thoroughly cure soft lubrication of gonorrhea-related posterior urethritis, because such mucosal infiltration often causes the urethral mucosa to adhere to each other, but instead causes urethral obstruction and narrowing, and there is a risk of uremia. Therefore, a thorough treatment must be performed. I use German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy, and at the same time take the gonorrhea panacea "Kelin Nong" as an oral medicine to make the body produce anti-gonococcal phagocytosis. This medicine is a world-renowned pain reliever that collects infiltrated mucosa to restore its inherent health. In this way, not only can the inflammation be completely eradicated, but the terrible other complications of gonorrhea can also be naturally and naturally cured. Because the soft infiltration of the posterior urethra, its complications can cause early swelling of the sperm, which has a huge hindrance to fertility. But now that there are such therapies, it can be avoided.</p>
<p>Clinic Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen each day, and each number will only cost 50 cents.</p>

<p>— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>There are many therapies for lung diseases, but there is no specific medicine that can cure them. Since ancient times, many unfortunate lung disease patients have sacrificed under the sentence of "no specific medicine."</p>
<p>Recently, due to scientific development, medicine and pharmacology have shown a rapid momentum, and the treatment of lung diseases has also made great progress. The medicine "Bu Fei Naer" (Lung Tonic) was invented under the driving force of science. This agent has proven to be effective in a short period of time for all stages of lung disease, and can gradually reduce the cavities in the lungs until they are as flat as ever. Therefore, "Bu Fei Naer" has been promoted as the chief priest among oral medicines for lung diseases. This is by no means an exaggeration. For various coughs before becoming consumption, taking "Bu Fei Naer" can relieve coughs within three hours.</p>

We are deeply grateful to Dr. Zhang for allowing our publication to publish it in advance, and we hope our readers will pay attention to it. Editor.</p>
<p>(I) The Key to Victory or Defeat in Modern Warfare</p>
<p>In the World War of 1914, Germany single-handedly resisted and fought for four years, ultimately suffering defeat. This was not due to unfavorable conditions on the front lines, but rather to the inadequacy of the home front. General Ludendorff, based on his experience in the Great War, advocated the theory of total war, believing that in modern warfare there is no distinction between the front and the rear. Victory or defeat is determined not by the quantity of armaments but by the strength of the nation's resources. This is no longer limited to the clash of the two armies, but a struggle between two great nations.</p>
<p>As the ancient saying goes, "Victory or defeat is a common occurrence for military strategists." This is especially true today. Temporary gains or losses are not enough to be a key to victory. The endurance of the war, leading to final victory, depends on the resilience of the entire nation and the strength of the entire national economy, especially the latter as a prerequisite for the material basis of a long-term war of resistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, modern international relations are intricate and complex. Disputes between two countries are often sufficient to trigger conflicts of interest involving related third countries or even the entire world. China, often referred to as a semi-colonial country, has always been a battleground for great powers. Japan's war against China is undoubtedly aimed at excluding the influence of Europe and America in the Far East, blockading China's door, and allowing Japan to enjoy it exclusively. Therefore, since the September 18th Incident, the Sino-Japanese conflict has long been a major performance on the international political stage. Since the July 7th Incident developed into the August 13th Battle, although the great powers have not actively performed due to various reasons, their spiritual and material sympathy and assistance to China have played a considerable role. Especially today, after the world has become aware of Japan's ambition to swallow China alone, they can no longer sit idly by. For example, Britain and the United States have successively presented Japan with strong diplomatic notes and have resolutely moved from spiritual sympathy for China to material assistance. Our country is fighting for independent survival and has national resources hundreds of times greater than Japan as its backing. Whether or not we can obtain foreign resources is not enough to sway our determination and real strength to win the war. However, obtaining foreign resources during wartime can indeed make the strength of the war of resistance more substantial. Moreover, our country's industry is backward, and modern military-industrial industry has no foundation to speak of. Therefore, striving for overseas resources is an indispensable step in the great cause of the war of resistance. The European War ended with the participation of the United States. On the surface, it was because the Allied Powers had this new force to join, and they were able to defeat the exhausted German army. In essence, it was because Germany was poor in resources, and therefore could not use overseas resources to make up for it, which led to its rapid collapse.</p>
<p>Our government, aware of this, ordered the stabilization of finance at the beginning of the war, engaged in the relocation of industries, promoted the industrial cooperative movement, and built the Southwest. It also developed resources, rectified the domestic economy, maintained credit, recognized the principle of open doors, expressed welcome to foreign investment, and worked hard to cooperate economically with friendly countries. Now, after a year and a half of the war of resistance, the currency system is stable, the economy is stable, and the international community praises it unanimously.</p>
<p>(II) The International Development of Resisting Aggression</p>
<p>Resisting aggression lies in our resolute resistance to the war until the final victory. If friends of our allies can uphold the principles of justice and humanity and take economic sanctions against the aggressors, their efforts will be doubled. This has already been mentioned earlier. Therefore, at the beginning of March 1938, the Chinese delegation in Beijing published the economic conditions for resisting Japan's aggression against China as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Prohibit the supply of military or industrial raw materials to Japan. Because Japan's military and industrial raw materials are largely dependent on foreign countries, if various countries stop supplying them, even if it is limited to a small number of major items, it will inevitably be severely hit.</p>
<p>(2) Boycott Japanese goods and Japanese ships. Japan's international balance of payments depends on the export of industrial products and its shipping income to achieve balance. If various countries boycott Japanese goods and Japanese ships, it will not only put its industry to death, but also destroy its entire national economy.</p>
<p>(3) Refuse credit to Japan. Japan's war expenses are huge, and domestic resources are limited. Without foreign credit, it will not be able to take care of itself, let alone develop the gains of aggression. If various countries refuse credit, not only will it not be able to obtain profits like the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, but it can also strengthen the effectiveness of points one and two.</p>
<p>(4) Economic measures of a considerable minority of countries. Because Japan's supply of raw materials and credit and the market for its exports are not concentrated in a small number of countries, these few countries include the United States, the British Empire, France, and Annam, the Netherlands, and the East Indies, Belgium, etc. If they sever economic relations with Japan, Japan will be like a fish out of water and unable to be active.</p>
<p>(5) Aid China. To strengthen China's ability to resist the war and resist international aggression, peace-loving countries should expand assistance to China and provide extensive military and financial assistance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in early February 1938, the Executive Committee of the League of Nations passed a resolution to assist China, reiterating the resolution of the previous conference, asking countries to do their best to assist China. At the same time, the International Peace Movement convened an international boycott conference in London, attended by representatives from twenty countries, unanimously passing a boycott resolution, severely punishing acts of aggression. Subsequently, an international peace movement conference was convened in Paris, unanimously opposing Japan's indiscriminate killing of innocent people, resolving to boycott Japanese goods, stop the supply of military materials, encourage loans to China, and resolving to establish the China Relief General Association in London as the central hub of the international China relief movement. Since October of the same year, the association has also published an international China relief newsletter once a month to communicate and promote the development of China relief work in various places. Currently, the international China relief work supported by these international peace groups is generally advancing along the following three major lines: (1) Urging governments to implement the League of Nations' resolutions on sanctions against Japan? (2) Expanding the boycott of Japanese goods movement, (3) Donating money, donating medicines and clothing, and providing relief to Chinese wounded soldiers and refugees.</p>
<p>(III) Achievements of Our Country's Economic Diplomacy</p>
<p>The aforementioned China relief work is all automatically carried out by fair-minded people around the world, and all are implemented in the form of civil organizations, which cannot be regarded as the gains of our country's economic diplomacy. The one that is initiated by our government and can be regarded as economic diplomacy work is to strive for financial assistance from various countries to China. Among the current countries, the most sympathetic and influential ones are the three major democratic countries: Britain, the United States, and France. They are described separately below.</p>
<p>China and the United States: China and the United States are located on both sides of the Pacific Ocean and have always been friendly. Since the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty at the Washington Conference, they have become even more harmonious. When the September 18th Incident occurred, former Secretary of State Stimson strongly upheld justice and ran around to appeal, eventually leading to the passage of the non-recognition resolution by the League of Nations. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the Chinese people looked up to the United States very deeply. Although there are isolationists and absolute pacifists in American public opinion, most of them condemned aggression and sympathized with the war of resistance. Especially those with a slightly longer-term vision, such as Mr. Stimson and Emory Luccock D.D., pastor of the Shanghai International Church, all reminded the United States of its moral responsibility in the Sino-Japanese war and advocated for some active actions. Renowned Far East commentator Nathaniel Pfeffer also changed his original position of isolationism after observing the results of China's one-year war of resistance and advocated that Americans should not cooperate with the aggressor: "Do not buy (Japanese goods), do not sell (military supplies), do not lend (credit)"; at the same time, cooperate with non-aggressor countries and provide them with various conveniences. The sympathy of American public opinion towards China can be seen from this.</p>
<p>What is noteworthy about Sino-American economic relations after the war is the silver issue and the credit issue.</p>
<p>In 1934, the United States began its silver purchase policy, raising the price of silver. Eventually, China was unable to maintain the silver standard and announced the cessation of the silver standard in November 1935, adopting a managed exchange rate system. In the spring of 1936, Chinese banker Chen Guangfu was commissioned to visit the United States and signed a silver agreement with US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, in which the United States purchased 50 million taels of Chinese silver at a price of US$0.45 per tael.</p>
<p>In July 1937, the first Sino-American agreement expired. At that time, Finance Minister Kong attended the coronation ceremony of the British King and then traveled to the United States, where he renewed the silver agreement, exchanging silver for gold to be used as our country's exchange reserve and export credit guarantee.</p>
<p>In July 1938, the agreement expired again. In late July, the Japanese spread rumors that Britain intended to put China's gold reserves under international co-management. The US Treasury Secretary officially declared that the US purchase of Chinese silver had been extended, with conditions largely unchanged.</p>
<p>According to the August issue of Citibank Monthly: In May 1938, the Chinese government requested the US government to continue purchasing silver to help stabilize Sino-American monetary relations. The two sides then established a rollover agreement to exchange Chinese silver for US dollar credit or gold. In the first half of 1938, 140 million taels of Chinese silver were shipped to New York, worth US$63 million. Since October 1937, a total of 190 million taels of silver have been shipped, worth US$84 million. Since 1934, the United States has purchased a total of 300 million taels of Chinese silver, and the proceeds have been used to bid for gold and as bank deposits. This is an example of monetary cooperation between the United States and China.</p>
<p>However, the destruction of war is unlimited. Therefore, it is not enough to talk about long-term resistance to the war without making great efforts to build and develop resources, let alone talk about post-war revival. It is necessary to use foreign credit.</p>
<p>In late September 1938, the Chinese mission arrived in the United States, still led by banking magnate Mr. Chen Guangfu. On the one hand, they discussed the supply of military supplies and credit with the American business community, and on the other hand, they consulted with the American government on loans.</p>
<p>On October 20th, the US Treasury Department declared that progress had been made in discussions with the Chinese mission.</p>
<p>On December 16th, a US$25 million loan between China and the United States was completed. At the same time, there was also good news about the establishment of a Sino-British loan. This credit is for a period of five years and is purely commercial in nature. Most of it will be used to purchase trucks and gasoline. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e37">British Gold Reserves <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— The Economist. No. 4976 Translated by Chen Baorong</p>
<p>Since the turmoil in Europe, London's position in world finance has declined along with its political position. The era of the British pound dominating the world has almost become a thing of the past. Consequently, the British government's gold reserves have been constantly lost and declined as the pound struggles. The London Economist also admits this frankly. However, based on the magazine's reporter's report on the local gold storage in South Africa, it can be seen that the foundation of the British pound is not as bad as people generally think. The magazine's reporter's proposal to re-evaluate the gold reserves of the Bank of England has now been implemented. Moreover, its view that the future of the British pound depends on the political situation in Europe is now being reflected. We are very grateful to Mr. Chen for translating and providing this article to our publication, and we hope that all those who care about British gold will pay attention to it. Editor.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Gold Reserves: The recent British Exchange Equalization Fund, as announced on December 31st of last year, is as follows: (Calculated at 140 shillings per ounce) (Unit: Million Pounds)</p>
<p>1937 1938</p>
<p>March 31st September 30th March 31st September 30th</p>
<p>Bank of England 516.6 537.6 537.6 537.6</p>
<p>Exchange Equalization Fund 186.9 279.3 297.8 151.8</p>
<p>Total 703.5 816.9 835.4 689.4</p>
<p>According to this, the Bank of England's gold reserves have remained stable throughout. However, the Exchange Equalization Fund lost £146 million in gold between April and September. The "Economist" magazine, published on October 22, 1938, estimated that the British Exchange Equalization Fund had lost at least £65 million by the end of May due to the withdrawal of French gold deposits in Britain. In the subsequent two months of August and September, another £100 million of gold had to be successively flowed out. Therefore, it was predicted that the Exchange Equalization Fund would have at most £130 million remaining by September 30th. Today's official report shows that the initial prediction was too pessimistic. Although: The difference between the prediction and the actual number is only £22 million, which seems to be excusable.</p>
<p>Establish a Foreign Treasury?: The average weekly amount of gold transported from South Africa to Britain at the beginning of last year was £1.5 million. However, on September 8th and 15th, it suddenly dropped from £1,054,000 to £353,000, and has not recovered since. However, South Africa has not stopped mining gold. Therefore, it can be seen that the reason why gold is staying in South Africa is probably due to the instructions of the British authorities. In these days of war clouds, it is indeed a good idea to keep a portion of the gold reserves in its own territory for safety reasons.</p>
<p>Recent Gold Reserve Estimates: Three months have passed since this official report was published. In these three months, of course, a large amount of gold has flowed out of Britain. Now, starting from the Exchange Equalization Fund's £152 million on September 30th, let us speculate on the situation of gold outflow after September 30th. First, let's look at the current situation of the import and export of gold in Britain: (Unit: Thousand Pounds)</p>
<p>October to December 1938</p>
<p>Imports Exports</p>
<p>From France 14,028 To the United States 102,984</p>
<p>Belgium 8,340 Canada  3,280</p>
<p>Holland 3,752 Belgium 1,910</p>
<p>Germany 2,570 Eire 1,010</p>
<p>South Africa 1,856 Sweden 978</p>
<p>West Africa 1,668 Switzerland 608</p>
<p>Switzerland 1,610 Others 386</p>
<p>India 1,469</p>
<p>Others 2,304</p>
<p>Total 37,597 Total 111,156</p>
<p>According to the above table, the net export of gold is £73,559,000, but there are still some things to consider. First, in the week before October 6th, £7,661,000 of gold was transported to Britain from Belgium, but this was deposited in London by the Belgian government for safety reasons, so its ownership did not change. On the contrary, it is questionable whether there is any refuge gold included in the £1,910,000 transported to Belgium. If this is taken as an indication of the Belgian people's settlement, then £7,661,000 should be subtracted from the total amount of imports.</p>
<p>Secondly, only £1,856,000 of gold was transported from South Africa. If calculated at £1.5 million per week, there should be £19,500,000. It can be seen that £17,600,000 of British special designated items remained in South Africa in three months. In addition, some of the gold transported to Canada may have been transported by the British authorities for safety reasons, but the amount is unknown.</p>
<p>Based on this, the gold export number can be revised to: (Million Pounds)</p>
<p>Net exports reported 73.6</p>
<p>Plus the import of Belgian refuge gold 7.7</p>
<p>Total 81.3</p>
<p>Minus the estimated number of designated items in South Africa and Canada 18.3</p>
<p>Net loss of the Exchange Equalization Fund 63.0</p>
<p>This amount of only £63 million is not enough to see the whole picture. The settlement purchases in the London gold market can offset this number, because the settlement includes gold imports. However, the situation caused by hoarding purchases is the opposite. After the approval of resale, the Exchange Equalization Fund has supplied £5 million of gold for hoarding in the last three months. In addition, it was also affected by the withdrawal of French gold, which Reynaud estimated to be £34 million, reaching £50 or £60 million by the end of the year. However, those shipped out of London accounted for £30 million.</p>
<p>Although the French Exchange Control has purchased gold pounds today, there is still no record of gold flowing from London into Paris. Some say that this gold pound has been converted into US dollars and has flowed into New York. This is to be expected, but the amount of British gold transferred to French designated items probably does not exceed £5 million at most. Adding the Exchange Equalization Fund's loss in the last three months, estimated at £73 million, then the British Exchange Equalization Fund on December 31, 1938, had only £80 million of gold remaining. (Calculated as an integer)</p>
<p>If calculated at the current market price of 150 shillings per ounce, then £80 million is actually worth £86 million, which can strengthen the technical position of equalizing foreign exchange. The "autumn crisis" has now passed, and most of the "hot money" stored in London has successively flowed out. It is expected that the US dollar will also be sold short, so its price will inevitably rise. As a result, general speculators may turn to need British pounds. In addition, the year-end clearance of the US dollar will enable the Exchange Equalization Fund to have some US dollars or designated gold stored in the United States. This is tantamount to hiding reserves and can recover the gold that the Bank of England sold to the Exchange Equalization Fund at the end of 1936. Recently, the number of trust banknotes issued will recover £30 million, and the extraction of £30 million of gold from the bank's issuing department will reduce its gold reserves by this amount, but the Exchange Equalization Fund will give the bank £30 million of securities. When this gold is transferred to the Exchange Equalization Fund, it can be raised to £53 million, calculated at 150 shillings per ounce. Therefore, the Exchange Equalization Fund's gold reserves will restore the number of £139 million. If there are no major political entanglements in the future, the technical position of the British pound is sufficient to meet general needs.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Wartime Shanghai Financial Market (Continued) <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Boquan</p>
<p>(6) Revival of the Cash Market Shanghai's gold market was originally a place for speculators to operate. In the past, monthly transactions often reached three to four million taels, but after the currency reform, it became deserted, with monthly transactions of only four to five thousand taels. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, it stopped completely. China's monetary system was originally based on silver, but since the implementation of the legal tender policy, it has become a managed currency. The exchange rate with foreign currencies has long lost its connection with the fluctuations of world gold and silver prices. However, since the government implemented foreign exchange controls last March, speculators have once again taken advantage of the fluctuations in the world's gold and silver ratios to manipulate them. As a result, the cash trading in Shanghai's unofficial market has suddenly become active. After May last year, the Shanghai cash price was affected by the London market, and a surge began, rising to 2,000 yuan in mid-June (the standard price for ten taels of gold). It once softened, but then rose again, reaching 2,068 yuan in November. At the beginning of March this year, due to a shortage of cash chips, coupled with purchases from North China, it once created a high price of 2,200 yuan, and is currently hovering around 2,100 yuan. Compared with before the war, it has risen by about 1,000 yuan. Although the cash market can affect the movement of a portion of gold, because China's foreign exchange base has become stable and the Sino-American Silver Agreement was also extended last year, it does not seem to have any impact on the overall financial situation.</p>
<p>(7) Changes in Clearinghouse Transactions Shanghai's clearinghouse transactions are divided into three groups: Chinese banks and money shops, and foreign banks. The Chinese Banks Clearing House was established in January 1933, and is sponsored by the Bankers' Joint Reserve Association. Its clearing procedures are similar to those of European and American countries. Money shops also have an organization called the Exchange Remittance Association, but their clearing methods are very outdated. As for the clearing of instruments between Bund banks (including foreign banks and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China), there is only a reconciliation method and no clearinghouse organization or system.</p>
<p>Before the war, the bank clearinghouse held two clearing sessions every day at 1:00 PM and 3:30 PM. After the war, due to a decrease in instruments, it was changed to once a day at 3:00 PM. From January to July 1937, the average daily clearing amount of the clearinghouse was more than 29 million yuan. From August to December, the daily average was only 7 million yuan, a ratio of about four to one. From January to July 1938, the daily average was only more than 6 million yuan. From August to December, there was a slight improvement, with a daily average of about 9 million yuan. Among the clearing amounts in the months after the war, December 1937 and December 1938 were the lowest, with a daily average of only 3.6 million yuan. However, the clearing amount has gradually increased recently. In January of this year, the daily average clearing amount has reached more than 24 million yuan, almost the same as the daily average before the war, which shows that Shanghai's commercial transactions have gradually become active under special circumstances.</p>
<p>The money shops' clearinghouse transactions are commonly known as "Zha Gong Che." The daily clearing amount includes the amount of interbank lending and transfer accounts, which is different in nature from the bank clearing figures and is difficult to compare. However, general observations show that the trend of the rise and fall of the money shops' clearing amount after the war is the same as that of the bank clearing figures. As for the clearing methods of the money industry, there have been slight improvements after the war. In the past, each money shop sent old cashiers to collect bills separately, but now each money shop sends two clearing staff to the Exchange Remittance Association from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM every day to handle the clearing centrally. In addition, the money shops' interbank clearing bills were originally stipulated that those over 500 yuan should be marked with large public bills, and those under 500 yuan and odd amounts should be marked with small public bills, which were cleared daily at the money industry reserve. In November last year, the Money Industry Association decided to cancel the names of large and small, and all amounts, regardless of the amount, should be marked with one public bill, which should be cleared daily, simplifying the procedures.</p>
<p>As for the clearing procedures of the Bund banks, after verifying the instruments with each other, the Bank of China used large transfer slips for the overall remittance, and the difference was settled daily by means of depositing or withdrawing cash. There was no clearinghouse organization. Since the outbreak of the war, the large transfer slip method adopted in the past has been abandoned, and each bank now sends personnel to the HSBC bank at 11:30 AM every day to conduct centralized verification. In addition, foreign banks have never had deposit and loan relationships with Chinese banks. After the war, for the convenience of clearing, foreign banks exceptionally opened current accounts with our Central Bank, and the Central Bank also opened accounts with foreign banks. As a result, the daily receivables and payables of Chinese and foreign banks are entrusted to each other for collection, and transferred within the current accounts, which is much more convenient than before.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Financial Industry Since the outbreak of the war, the environment in which the Shanghai financial industry is located has been very unusual. Leaving aside foreign banks for the time being, as far as Chinese banks and money shops are concerned, since the July 7th Incident two years ago, there has been a wave of withdrawals. In the month before the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the deposits of various banks and money shops clearly decreased. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the banking and money industry closed for four days. After the government promulgated measures to stabilize the financial situation, people's hearts began to stabilize slightly, and deposits did not decrease significantly. As the war zone expanded, wealthy people from various places came to Shanghai to seek refuge with their assets. As a result, the deposits of various banks and money shops gradually increased. However, most of these increased deposits were current deposits. On the banking and money industry side, it was necessary to accumulate sufficient reserves to respond to the situation.</p>
<p>After the war, the business policies of various banks and money shops strived for stability, and they were very cautious about various loans, mostly reducing the scope of business, only accepting deposits and not making loans. Fortunately, a portion of the pawnshop customers of the banking and money industry who suffered losses in the war, recently benefited from the high prices in Shanghai. In addition to making up for the losses of the war, they also had surpluses. Therefore, the loans made by the banking and money industry before the war, except for customers who suspended business during the war, could often be recovered on time. In addition, the business of various banks, except for a portion of loans, foreign exchange and other businesses, inevitably stagnated after the war, while other businesses such as warehousing, real estate trusts, etc., have increased compared with before the war. This kind of abnormal development is the only phenomenon in the current special environment in Shanghai, and it is self-evident that it cannot last long.</p>
<p>The loss of assets of the banking and money industry during the war was inevitable. Fortunately, most banks and money shops usually operate stably and have sufficient reserves. The previous surpluses are more than enough to offset the current losses. Only a very small number of smaller banks suffered from the impact of the war, and there were rumors of financial difficulties. As for those who went bankrupt as a result, there was only one bank. At the same time, among the four banks that suspended business in the month before the outbreak of the war, two had resumed business one after another last year.</p>
<p>The four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China are the largest government banks in the country and have outstanding influence in the financial industry. Their head offices were originally located in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, these four government banks moved their head offices to the inland and established branches in various provinces in the southwest and Hong Kong. Shanghai's financial power has become dispersed. Currently, Shanghai's banks feel that the channels and targets for their usual use of funds have been blocked and reduced after the war. In addition, the government is actively promoting and encouraging investment in the development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce in the inland. Therefore, general commercial banks in Shanghai have a tendency to develop towards the inland. Recently, many banks have established branches in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. The center of gravity of finance has shifted, and the future development is worthy of attention.</p>

<p>In view of the Japanese side's prohibition of the use of legal tender in "North China" and the establishment of the Sino-British exchange equalization fund loan, the people of the country suddenly became interested in the future of legal tender. Therefore, this journal held its first symposium at noon on the 18th of this month on the fifth floor of this building. The records of the symposium were originally scheduled to be published in this issue of this journal. However, as they are being sent to the original speakers for review, they can only be published in the next issue. The attendees were all well-known domestic currency experts and scholars who have a deep understanding of Sino-Japanese economic issues. The attendees and observers are introduced as follows.

<p>Yesterday's after-hours cash market was quiet due to the weekly holiday, with only a few members present and no supply or demand positions. Therefore, prices were not quoted. However, there was no activity in a certain money exchange shop, with selling prices around 2,070 yuan. Gold jewelry prices remained unchanged, with Da Tong Hang still quoting 210 yuan, Xin Tong Hang at 208 yuan, and buying at 202 yuan. Also, according to a London telegram on the 18th, British pure gold rose by half a pence per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 and a half pence.</p>
<h3 id="e41">British and Indian Silver Prices Weak <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 18th, speculators sold off, and lacking support, the market was flat and slightly weak. Nearby silver futures continued to fall by 0.025, and distant futures also continued to fall by 0.0125. According to a New York silver telegram, Indian silver was slightly weak, with spot prices falling by 4 annas, and near and distant futures also falling by 3 annas.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Securities Stock Markets in China and the West Over the Past Week <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Due to the sudden tension in the Central European situation last week, trading in various stocks at the Shanghai Public Trading House sharply declined. However, market prices did not show a significant softening. In general, both buyers and sellers adopted a cautious attitude and waited and watched. Several stocks continued to create new highs since 1937, such as International Trust (3.75), Tramway (41), Waterworks A (692.5), B and C (28), and Jardine Spinning and Weaving Factory preferred stock (155).</p>
<p>The most actively traded common stock was Jardine Spinning and Weaving Factory, with over 50,000 shares traded, priced from 1.820 to 18.80 yuan. At the end of the week, due to the deteriorating Central European situation, it followed the British and American stock markets and became weak, closing at 18.50 yuan. Otherwise, it would have been expected to exceed 19 yuan. The second most actively traded stock was International Trust. The company announced that the bond interest owed at the end of September last year would be paid together with the interest due at the end of March this year, proving that its economic position has become sound. Therefore, demand surged, with over 20,000 shares traded throughout the week, priced from 3.20 yuan to 3.75 yuan, and 3.65 yuan at the end of the week. Next was China Land and Plantation, with over 20,000 shares traded, priced from 8 yuan to 8.40 yuan, and 8.20 yuan at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Ewo Land was 9.55 yuan at the beginning of the week and only 9.10 yuan at the end of the week, with only over 1,000 shares traded. Wheelock &amp; Co. traded about half as much as last week, but the price was slightly weaker, closing at 34 yuan at the end of the week.

<p>Yesterday, the source of domestic rice became even scarcer. Only 1,000 packages of Hetxia rice arrived on the 7th, mainly because most areas in the inland were unable to transport to Shanghai. As a result, the market was stimulated and rose again, showing a chaotic appearance. Thick and thin, high-quality japonica rice was priced at 14 yuan, medium-quality rice was also at 13.67 yuan, and Hetxia rice was around 13 yuan, more than 30 cents higher than the previous market. Duyang, Jianbu, and Bianyuan also increased by 20 to 30 cents. In general, this market situation is entirely due to the obstruction of sources, which stimulates people's desire to go up. If this continues, it will not be a blessing for the people's food in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Before that, this port's foreign firm tea market was extremely sparse with inventory. Although the foreign firms have imported, however, the number of transactions was very few and the market situation was silent for a long time. Since a large batch of raw tea was shipped from Ningbo last week, the factories have started work one after another. Until a few factories have made box tea, posted out small samples, the extracted core fine eyebrow sales plate once rose. From one hundred seventy-eighty yuan to a peak record of more than two hundred twenty yuan. According to the raw tea, all of it was purchased by various factories last year, however, it was blocked in Ningbo Port. After several months, the cost of foreign exchange settlement and all handling costs were much higher. The foreign firms, on the other hand, saw that the source goods arrived a little surging, and immediately turned to wait-and-see attitude, which made the market situation tired again and the transaction was still clear.</p>

<p>In the bituminous coal market, because high-quality goods such as Indian coal are increasingly scarce, and most of the sources are of medium quality, which does not meet the needs of the street, the intention to buy is very strong, and the price is gradually firm. Therefore, Hokkaido coal is rising in time, and the daily turnover can be two or three hundred tons, which is also the trend of the environment. It is estimated that the price of general coal is 35 yuan per ton, screened blocks 37 yuan, and coal chips 34 yuan. Retailers in the industry will add a margin as appropriate.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the war, white lead skin has been quiet for a long time due to customs restrictions on exports. Although the Tianjin smokestack gang has occasionally embellished it, the number is small, but for 20 months, the total has been due to the lack of a fixed new relationship, coupled with the battery factory in the street, the printing room, and the tea stack gang have repeatedly needed to do business, and recently the spot goods on the market are about to be sold out, and the standard has risen due to the environment. The selling price is such that No. 2 color sells for 245 yuan per barrel, Nos. 3 and 4 sell for 240 yuan, No. 5 opens for 215 yuan, No. 6 205 yuan, and No. 7 sells for only 195 yuan because there are more circulating goods. The buying price of No. 8 is about 200 yuan, and the market goods of No. 9 and 10 are even thinner, so the asking price is 225 or 6 yuan. Other thick colors are opened at 220 yuan across the board. The trading has been very prosperous in recent days. Although it was Sunday yesterday, it was heard that the transaction still reached 50 or 60 barrels. It is found that the overseas fixed price is 23 and a half pounds per ton, which is also 10 shillings higher than before.</p>

<p>The flannel market, because the fixed price is high and the foreign exchange is tight, the sellers are hoarding. The standard opening price is that all are seeing a frenzied rise. The old average annual increase is more than one yuan, and the sellers are still unwilling to sell early. At the moment, the number one gray flannel is shouting to sell at ten yuan and five corners, number two at nine yuan, number three at seven yuan and seven corners, and number four at five yuan and eight corners.

Paris flannel, which is the best-selling wool product in late spring, early autumn and summer, is not yet in season, but the current market suddenly jumped first, and all rose by several corners compared to the beginning of the week. The main reason is that a certain domestic product of 200 boxes was confirmed to be "made in England" and was detained in Hong Kong, the market atmosphere suddenly tightened, and the market continued to rise and became popular.</p>

<p>Hou's Troops Departing from Panlong, Japanese Aircraft at the Airfield Destroyed</p>
<p>More Than a Dozen Japanese Soldiers Killed, Three Wounded in Hou's Troops</p>
<p>Hou Junren, the leader of the powerful guerrilla forces in western Shanghai, led his troops from Panlong Town yesterday morning when the sky was slightly bright, detouring and advancing towards the Japanese military base in Hongqiao. He surrounded the Japanese military headquarters and launched a fierce attack. Another team of warriors was selected to break into the airfield and destroy a Japanese aircraft. The Japanese army also desperately broke through the encirclement, and the two sides fought for about two hours. Just as the Japanese army was unable to support, the Japanese army from Tushanwan heard the alarm and suddenly dispatched more than 200 security guards to join the battle. Hou was afraid of being outnumbered and falling into a deep encirclement, and the purpose had been achieved, so he led his troops back to their original location. In addition to destroying a Japanese aircraft, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, and three warriors were wounded in Hou's troops.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Attacked Xinzhuang and Was Defeated Xinzhuang Town, the fourth station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, is the border between Shanghai and Songjiang, and is connected to the Shanghai-Min Highway. Therefore, for the convenience of controlling and commanding the guerrillas, a headquarters was set up there to carry out mobile warfare in southern and western Shanghai. The Japanese army received a report from a traitor on the morning of the 17th and launched a night attack. Unexpectedly, the guerrillas had already taken precautions and set up an ambush, causing the Japanese army to be surrounded in the village and suddenly collapse, fleeing towards Zhuanqiao in Shanghai County. The guerrillas took advantage of the situation to pursue from both sides. The Japanese army was unable to stand still, so they rushed straight to Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai along the Shanghai-Min Road. At that time, they abandoned a lot of guns, ammunition, and baggage, and the guerrillas gained an unexpected harvest. Yesterday, they began to clear up the fake "self-defense corps" on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road.</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Bombardment of Zha Port Two small Japanese warships, carrying dozens of naval marines, sailed to the vicinity of Zha Port in southern Huangpu and indiscriminately fired cannons at the town. Houses far and near were shaken. More than a dozen residents of the town who did not have time to escape were killed, and all the houses were turned to ashes.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Attack on Dujiagang After several tug-of-war battles, most of the merchants and people in Dujiagang moved away, and it has become a dead market. The guerrillas of the Li Zhiming unit suddenly advanced to the area the night before last (the 17th). The naval marines of the Japanese army stationed there heard the alarm and immediately fired dense guns and cannons at the shore. The Li unit was divided into two units, one attacking the back of the Japanese army and encircling the Japanese army on land, and the other scattered along the coast to resist the Japanese navy. They fought back and forth for one or two hours before the Li unit withdrew to its original defense. After investigation, dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and four members of the Li unit were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Demolished Houses in Shangchuan The war in the three counties of Pudong, Fengnan, and Chuan has been quite fierce recently. The Japanese army believed that guerrillas were hiding in the houses along the Shangchuan Railway. Yesterday (the 18th), they transferred more than 200 engineers to demolish the houses along the road one after another. When the residents heard the news, they were all panicked.</p>

<p>Imports Exceeded Exports in the First Ten Days of This Month, Mainly Due to a Sharp Decline in Exports</p>
<p>Continental News said that in the first ten days of this month, Japan's foreign trade encountered setbacks, with imports exceeding exports by 12,792,000 yen. So far this year, Japan's imports have also increased by 8,986,000 yen compared with the same period last year, mainly due to the increase in imports of groceries, wool, papermaking raw materials, and raw cotton. During the same period, Japan's main export, cotton fabrics, was less than the export during the same period last year.</p>

<p>More than 500 alumni and guests attended, including Yu Qiaqing and Lin Kanghou, who also came to offer their congratulations.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the founder of Fudan University, celebrated his centenary birthday yesterday. To express their congratulations, the Fudan Alumni Association of this city held a birthday celebration at the New Asia Restaurant at 6 p.m. There were more than 500 attendees, including guests Yu Qiaqing, Xu Ji, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Yu Zuoting, and alumni in Shanghai Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Xu Xiaochu, among others. The event was unprecedentedly grand. First, the chairman, Ye Jichun, expressed his gratitude, followed by Jiang Yiping reading a congratulatory message. After the dinner, an annual meeting was held, and the event concluded joyfully at around 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Agenda of the Meeting: (1) Opening; (2) Chairman's Speech; (3) Birthday Greetings; (4) Dinner; (5) Annual Meeting; (A) School Song; (B) Speeches; (C) Report on Association Affairs; (D) Report on the Recent Situation by Representatives of the Alma Mater; (E) Discussion; (F) Entertainment; (G) Raffles; (H) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Ye Jichun said in his congratulatory speech, "Today is the 100th birthday of Elder Ma Xiang, and the Fudan Alumni Association is holding a celebration in particular. We are deeply honored by the presence of all the guests. Mr. Ma's birthday is the gengzi year of the Daoguang reign, which according to the lunar calendar is February 17th, and according to the Gregorian calendar is March 19th, 1940. Everyone present here today must be very happy. It is rare to hear of someone living to be a hundred years old. We only hear of old people in the countryside who do not ask about worldly affairs and live a life of peace and contentment to reach one hundred years old, but even that is rare. However, Elder Xiang lived to be a hundred years old, and he did not only care for himself. He is always doing things for society. This is truly unprecedented. Perhaps you doubt the words 'unprecedented,' but in China's more than 4,000-year history, although there have been people who lived to be a hundred years old, it is very rare for famous people to live to be a hundred years old. We are now participating in an unprecedented grand event, and we are truly very honored."</p>
<p>Xia Jinguang's Thank You Speech: Xia Jinguang, representing the Ma family, said in his thank you speech, "Today I am very honored to participate in Ma Shou's birthday as a guest. When I met Mr. Ma, he was already in his sixties. At that time, he was running Fudan Public School. I had no experience in education, and Mr. Xiangbo guided me in everything. For the sake of the school, he struggled tirelessly and created today's Fudan, full of talented people, all of whom he cultivated. Today, I am very grateful for everyone's presence and extend my infinite gratitude on behalf of Elder Xiang."</p>
<p>Holding the Annual Meeting: Finally, the alumni association meeting was held, reporting on association affairs, discussing action plans, and adding wonderful entertainment to liven up the atmosphere. In addition, each participant received a pair of longevity bowls, a commemorative medal, and supplies donated by various manufacturers, and everyone was beaming with joy. The event concluded joyfully at around 10 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Fake "Chinese Workers Welfare Association" Performs a Farce in Hongkou <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>They Actually Established a So-Called "Workers Self-Defense Corps," Luring Thugs to Join, Almost Resulting in Violence. Traitor Fu Xiaoan Actually Attended to "Admonish" Them</p>
<p>In order to attempt to manipulate the Shanghai workers' movement and expand the power of the people for their own use, the Japanese and puppet authorities previously initiated the organization of the fake "Chinese Workers Welfare Association." Hu Shouchang, the fake "Director of the Social Bureau," served as chairman, and a Japanese named Kyubota Noboru served as advisor. Long Xiangshan's younger brother from Hubei, using the alias Lin Zijing, served as secretary-general. They attracted some idlers and labor brokers, fabricated the names of labor unions, falsely reported the list of workers, sang their own praises, and fraudulently received subsidies from the Japanese side. Therefore, although the "establishment" of the association has been more than half a year, because the labor unions of various industries in this city unanimously refused to cooperate, the content is empty and there is no real strength. Recently, under the instruction of the Japanese side, they organized a "Workers Self-Defense Corps," which was declared "established" yesterday. The fake "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan went to "admonish" them. Lin and others sent out thugs in advance to attract people, claiming that all participants would be picked up by special cars and would receive a subsidy of two yuan per person. Hearing this, some idlers gathered many thugs and loafers and gathered in the Tianhou Palace at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. They wrote the names of "various labor unions" on white cloth banners, and each participant was wrapped in a white cloth armband. There were about 500 people, posing as members. At about 8:00 a.m., the "Welfare Association" sent a car to take them to Hongkou Park to line up. At about 10:00 a.m., the fake "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan arrived and climbed a small grave to "admonish" them. Then Kyubota Noboru gave a speech. Because the location was desolate, no one heard what wonderful arguments he made. At 12:00 p.m., the meeting was announced to be over, and the "Welfare Association" distributed a bag of food to each person and ordered them to walk back. In general, participants were very dissatisfied. After arriving at the Tianhou Palace, they asked Lin for the two yuan subsidy, but Lin broke his promise and did not pay. Therefore, a violent conflict almost broke out. The whole farce is truly laughable.</p>

<p>To Place Japanese Foreign-Class Customs Officers, Chinese Customs Officers Were Squeezed Out</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs had previously employed a large number of Japanese customs officers and assigned them to work in internal and external classes. It is now heard that in order to continue to place Japanese foreign-class customs officers, the customs authorities have decided to transfer twelve Chinese foreign-class customs officers to Wenzhou Customs to continue working. It is said that the monthly salaries of the twelve customs officers are around two or three hundred yuan, and they are quite responsible. Now, in order to obey orders, they have scheduled to leave Shanghai for Wenzhou by boat tomorrow (the 21st). It is learned that after the twelve customs officers arrive in Wenzhou, they will still be responsible for foreign-class work and will be paid their original salaries.</p>

<p>In Order to Seize Exclusive Control of Yangtze River Shipping, the Japanese Troops Blockaded Most of the Downstream Ports and Set Up Fake Checkpoints in Various Ports Below Zhenjiang to Collect Taxes on Goods. The Blockaded Ports Are Generally Blockaded with Giant Ships Directly Aground, or Woven with Giant Bamboo, to Block the Ports, Making It Difficult for Ships to Enter and Exit. A Few Days Ago, a Fake Policeman in Zhangjiagang Reverted to Righteousness, Killing Two Japanese Soldiers and Throwing Their Bodies into the Yangtze River. The Japanese Troops Tried Their Best to Salvage Them, But They Have Not Been Found Yet, and They Threatened to Burn Houses in Shazhou to Vent Their Anger. At Luojiaqiao in Jiangbei, Chinese Troops Attacked the Fake Checkpoints. All the Japanese Troops in Zhangjiagang Crossed the River. The Chinese Troops Have Gone Elsewhere. Now, Along the River, Starting from Huangtiangang in Jiangyin, Such As Hupu, Baimao, Tianshenggang, Renjiagang, Qiyakou, Baxigang, Xiagang, Zhangjiagang, Yanglingang, Liuhekou, Shiyixigang, Qinglonggang, Niuhonggang, and Xingang, There are Fifteen Fake Checkpoints Set Up to Collect Taxes and Donations. Each Chicken and Duck Must Donate Twelve Cents, and Rice, Grain, Cattle, and Pigs Must All Pay Donations. As a Result, People Are Living in Poverty and Filled with Resentment.</p>

<p>Because the Terms of the Current Chinese Directors, Committee Members, and Supervisory Committee Members of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association are About to Expire, the Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting Was Convened Last Time to Discuss the Re-election, But the Meeting Was Adjourned Due to Insufficient Number of People.

<p>Cargo Transportation Between Shanghai and Ningbo Was Slack, and Tangbei Did Not Intend to Join. The Yin County Government Ordered Various Shipping Companies to Fill Out Employee Reports</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities Previously Strengthened Coastal Defense to Prevent Strong Young Men from Leaving the Country, So Except for Wenzhou, Haimen, and Ningbo, Which Were Designated as Ports of Call, Dinghai, Shipu, Xiangshan, and Other Places Were All Blockaded, Prohibiting Foreign Ships from Sailing. Therefore, Transportation Between Shanghai and Dinghai Was Cut Off, and More Than Three Months Have Passed Since Then. Although Various Parties Have Requested Repeatedly, It Has Not Been Approved. Now, the Ningbo Defense Headquarters, in Response to the Request of Dinghai Fish Merchants, Has Stipulated Five Measures and Approved the Employment of Hana and Haifu Ships to Load Fresh Fish to Shanghai, But Passengers Are Absolutely Prohibited. Now, the Hana Ship Is Scheduled to Sail from Shanghai to Ningbo This Afternoon at 4:00 P.M., Turn to Dinghai, and Then Load Fresh Fish and Return Directly to Shanghai. As for the Haifu Ship, It Is Currently Sailing to Wenzhou and Must Wait Until It Arrives in Shanghai to Determine the Sailing Date.</p>
<p>Minhe Approved to Sail to Ningbo Once: The Ningbo Defense Command received a report from Yufengheng Tax Firm and Fuji Firm, stating that their firms' manager, Fujihang, had approximately seven thousand pieces of various goods, including tinfoil, green oil, leather oil, mat grass, gold thread hats, medicinal materials, porcelain, tobacco leaves, and photo frames. These items have been piled up for a long time, causing difficulties in financial turnover. They have already applied to the Chamber of Commerce and the Property Adjustment Office for approval to export these goods and have been issued a certificate. These miscellaneous goods urgently need to be transported to Shanghai for sale, as they are crucial to their livelihoods. Therefore, they propose to hire the registered and approved Minhe steamship to transport the goods to Shanghai in two shipments. The command, after checking that the reported inventory was not much, specifically approved the Minhe ship to transport the goods to Shanghai in one shipment.</p>
<p>Tangbei Does Not Intend to Join Sailing to Ningbo: The Tangbei ship of the Huamei Shipping Company, a US merchant in this city, originally sailed on the Shanghai-Taiwan route. After Haimen was harassed by Japanese warships and obstructed from resuming sailing, the ship changed to the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. Recently, the Ningbo Defense Command approved it to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, but the company's authorities believed that the cargo transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo was slack, and the business was deserted. Moreover, the company's Tangsai had already joined the sailing, so the Tangbei ship temporarily did not intend to sail to Ningbo and continued to sail on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Submit Employee Reports Today: Yesterday, various shipping companies in this city received instructions from the Ningbo Shipping Association, which was forwarded by the Yin County Government, stating that the total number of crew members, buyers, and sailors (including all personnel on board) of each ship sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line should be investigated and registered in detail to prevent impersonation and false pretenses. The notice required shipping companies to submit lists of their buyers and sailors, including their names, native places, ages, genders, the months and years they have worked on the ship, their positions, their levels of education, and their home addresses, along with two photos each. These lists should be compiled by the association and submitted to the government for review. The progress of the process should also be reported to the government for record. The association yesterday sent letters to various shipping companies, requesting them to prepare the lists of buyers and sailors, along with two photos each, within five days and submit them to the association for compilation and submission.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Hoarders Deliberately Cause Panic, Affecting the Rice Market <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Price Evaluation Committee Will Strictly Crack Down</p>
<p>Since the Rice and Bean Industry and other seven groups jointly formed the Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee, stipulating that the limit price should still be 14 yuan, the price of rice has gradually returned to normal due to the steady arrival of goods. The highest quality rice has returned to 14 yuan, which meets the limit price. However, since the day before yesterday, the price has risen again. The price of special japonica rice has risen to more than 14 yuan, and the market has suddenly become chaotic. According to people in the rice industry, the reason for this sudden increase is that the market is filled with rumors that Changshu, Wuxi, and Wuhu are banning the export of rice. At the same time, the dangerous situation in Europe and the tense situation in this city also have an impact. However, these are all deliberate scare tactics by hoarders who intentionally spread rumors. In fact, it is all false, because the arrival of goods is still steady and there is no ban on transportation. The Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee has previously stipulated measures to punish unfair trading and will severely crack down on this dark market.</p>

<p>The Person in Charge of the Hotel in Hong Kong Has Issued a Firm Statement</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that the rumor that the owner of the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai and a previous operator had leased the hotel to a certain Japanese company has been firmly denied by a person in charge of the New Asia Hotel in Hong Kong. It is said that since August 1937, the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai has been closed due to the war, and all responsible personnel have left Shanghai. The hotel's business office moved to Hong Kong many months ago. He is certain that the hotel's landlord or representative has never engaged in any kind of consultation with the Japanese side.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Japanese and Puppet Authorities Withhold 150 Million in Customs Duties <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Unilaterally Changing Tax Rates Benefits Japan, Hitting British and American Businesses</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet authorities seized the customs offices in North China and Shanghai, and the customs revenues of each office were withheld and deposited in the Japanese-owned Zhengjin Bank. They also unilaterally modified the tax rates to benefit Japan, which affected the trade of various countries with China. The administration of various customs offices in the occupied areas was completely destroyed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Unilaterally Reducing Tax Rates Benefits Japan: China's independent tariff movement has undergone many difficulties. Through the efforts of the authorities, it was successfully achieved in the 19th year of the Republic. Unexpectedly, this hard-won tariff autonomy was destroyed by the seizure by the Japanese and puppet authorities. Now, the four northeastern provinces have been cut off as the puppet "Manchukuo." After the customs offices in North China were seized, the puppet organization announced new tax rules and abolished the 2.5% surtax. The tax rates on 254 kinds of goods were modified. On the import side, wheat and flour were tax-free, and the tax rates on seafood, textiles, and mineral sands were reduced. On the export side, cotton was tax-free, and the tax rates on wool were reduced.</p>
<p>150 Million Yuan Was Withheld: The portions of customs duties that should have been allocated for debt compensation from the customs offices in the three northeastern provinces have never been paid since those offices were seized in the 21st year of the Republic. Other customs offices, except for Jianghai Customs, which paid once in June of the 27th year, have also never paid. The customs duties withheld in the 27th year were as follows: Tianjin Customs: 56.94 million yuan; Jiaozhou Customs: 8.87 million yuan; Qinhuangdao Customs: 4.54 million yuan; Dongguan Customs: 4.02 million yuan; Jianghai Customs: 83.78 million yuan. The total amount was about 158.15 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Trade of Various Countries Affected: The trade of Britain, the United States, Germany, and France with China has been sharply reduced since January of the 27th year of the Republic due to the seizure of the customs offices in the occupied areas of China by the Japanese and puppet authorities and the unilateral modification of tax rates. However, Japan's trade with China has jumped to the first place in Chinese trade due to its use of special forces. For example, last year, the trade of various countries with China was as follows: Japan: 326.41 million yuan; the United States: 238.1 million yuan; Germany: 169.37 million yuan; Britain: 127.37 million yuan; France: 43.16 million yuan.</p>

<p>Please Ask Various Radio Stations to Increase Celebration Programs, Parks Open, Hospitals Provide Free Medical Treatment</p>
<p>This year's April 4th Children's Day has been prepared for celebration by the Children's Day Preparatory Committee jointly organized by the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works Children's Protection Section, China Child Welfare Association Shanghai Branch Office, Shanghai Children's Hope Care Association, Shanghai YMCA, YWCA, Women's Temperance Association, and other organizations. The association has sent a letter to various radio stations in this city for Children's Day celebration programs, and has begun soliciting Children's Day essays (limited to 500 words per article), planning to issue Children's Day special publications in various newspapers. It is learned that the association has also sent letters to the authorities of the two concessions, requesting that the French Park and Zhaofeng Park be opened on Children's Day so that children's organizations can visit freely. The association has also negotiated with major hospitals to provide free medical treatment for children on Children's Day, expressing the utmost care for children. And in order to facilitate the investigation by the authorities of the two concessions, the preparatory committee hopes that all charitable organizations and shelters that plan to hold garden parties on that day can inform them of the number of children visiting and the route they will take before the 28th, so that they can report to the police station. In addition, the association has begun collecting Children's Day gifts to distribute to children in charitable organizations and shelters. The collection locations are as follows: (1) Children's Day Preparatory Committee, No. 33 Wangjiasha Huayuan Road, (2) YMCA, No. 599 Sichuan Road, (3) YWCA, No. 999 Jingansi Road, (4) Moore Memorial Church, No. 316 Yu Qiaqing Road, (5) Children's Care Association, No. 451 Dagu Road (Inside Shanghai Women's University).</p>
<p>The Fake "Municipal Government" Operating Tax:</p>
<p>Extremely Exploitative</p>
<p>Ruthless Exactions, Penetrating Every Hole: After the fake "Shanghai Municipal Government" stopped collecting the fake "Consumption Tax" last month, the lifeline of money was cut off, and it fell into a difficult situation that could not be maintained, so it actively invented new "taxes," ruthlessly exploiting them to make up for the deficit. Starting from April, it resolutely disregarded everything and started collecting the fake "Operating Tax." The fake "Tax Standard Tax Rate Table" and the fake "Provisional Classification Tax Rate Table" were published yesterday, with many items, penetrating every hole, and extremely exploitative. At present, there are only a few shops with small capital in the suburbs of Shanghai. After this harsh "tax" is exploited, it will be difficult to maintain operations. The fake "tax rate" is copied as follows: (A) Fake "Operating Tax Standard Tax Rate Table," (1) (Pawnshop Industry) Tax rate of two thousandths, based on the standard of business volume. The business volume in this item refers to the principal amount of the pawn; (2) (Pawnshop Industry) Tax rate of three thousandths; (3) (Forwarding Industry, Laundry Industry) ten thousandths; (4) (Transportation Industry, Construction Industry, Painting and Brushing Industry, Warehousing Industry, Water and Electricity Industry, Well Drilling Industry, Customs Declaration Industry, Securities Industry, Bath Industry, Washing and Dyeing Industry, Hairdressing Industry, Restaurant Industry, Pastry Industry, Noodle Industry, Packing and Boxing Industry, Real Estate Leasing Industry, Decoration Industry, Guanguan Industry, Restaurant Industry, Cooked Food Industry, Printing Publishing and Books Stationery Education Supplies Industry) twenty thousandths, (5) (Auction Industry, Western Restaurant Industry, Dairy Industry, Photography Industry, Flower and Tree Industry, Ivory Bone Industry, Hotel Industry, Gold and Silver Jewelry Utensils Industry, Gold Shop Industry) Twenty Thousandths, (6) (Manufacturing Industry) Ten to Twenty Thousandths, (7) (Money Shop Industry, Silver Shop Industry) Five Thousandths, (B) Fake "Operating Tax Provisional Classification Tax Rate Table" (1) Banks and Money Shops: Taxed annually at five thousandths of the amount of capital, collected monthly, (2) Grocery Stores: Tax rate of ten thousandths, based on the standard of business volume (including grain, firewood, charcoal, kerosene, salt, matches, mountain goods, local goods, candles, soap, cotton, forest products, sauce gardens, shoes, socks, hats, silk cocoons, mineral sands, sand and gravel, flying flowers, yarn heads, hemp, clothing boxes, combs, yarn, yellow and white wax, plaster, real estate, hair, bristles, hair, horns, bones, clothing, (3) Consumption Tax Rate fifteen thousandths (including sexual intestines, cotton fabrics, hemp fabrics, paper, oil, bamboo, wood, zong, rattan, bricks, tiles, lime, medicine, tea shoots, old goods, steel utensils, ceramic materials, enameled utensils, straw woven products, tea, lacquer, North-South goods, copper tin lead utensils, fans, pickled fish, eggs, chemicals, chickens, ducks, beef, mutton, fruits, fish row, smoked meat, vehicles, groceries, seafood, cement, pigments, western goods, hardware, rice milling, oil extraction, shipbuilding, sawing wood, metallurgy, kiln utensils, coal balls, tea rolling, blankets, box making, binding, brushing emperor, dyeing, printing, clothing making, boiling, meat oil, lamp making, egg yolk, white sugar, thermos bottles, buttons, alkali making, colored eggs, electrical appliances, copper plating, celluloid, articles, storage batteries, electrical appliances, ice making, eyeglass frames, tin foil, silver spraying, seasonings, film production, rubber articles, glass, western medicine, rubber, water and electricity materials, longan, department stores, wool fabrics, game, candy, tea food, canned food, ham, incense candles, firecrackers,</p>

<p>All Sectors Will Fly Flags to Commemorate, Various Schools Will Lecture on the History of the Restoration</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the Fake Shanghai Local Memorial Day. At that time, various institutions, public organizations, businesses, schools, and households in this city will all fly flags to commemorate the event. In the past, various schools would also have a day off on this day. Now, because it is a time of national crisis, with the students' studies as the main priority, most have stopped taking days off and are holding classes as usual. However, they will hold memorial meetings separately and lecture on the history of the local restoration to encourage students.</p>

<p>Appeal to France to Take Responsibility for Handling, Czech Residents Are Under German Responsibility</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that as a result of Hitler's recent invasion of land, a small number of Yugoslavs residing in Shanghai, about fifty or sixty people, felt anxious yesterday (the 18th). Before Hitler completely annexed Czechoslovakia, the Czech residents in China were represented by the Czech Minister Seba. Seba's official position has now been seized, so Shanghai's Yugoslavs have neither consular protection nor a representative. According to Pajic, chairman of the Yugoslav National Committee in this city, they have appealed to the Yugoslav capital to entrust France to take responsibility for handling the affairs of the Yugoslav residents in China. The French Consulate represents the Yugoslav residents in Vietnam and Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. At the same time, it was announced that the German Embassy here has assumed full responsibility for all Czech resident affairs. Although the personnel of the Czech Legation are still staying at the Legation at 727 Haig Road, they do not have any official status.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Garages Along the Road <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Prohibited from Being Converted into Living Rooms</p>
<p>The French Public Works Bureau Formulated Measures</p>
<p>Because the population of Shanghai has increased sharply, the French Concession Public Works Bureau has formulated four regulations on the use of garages, ordering owners to comply, in order to prevent the sub-landlords from building mezzanine floors and using garages for rent. The regulations are copied as follows: Article 1. It is strictly forbidden to use garages along the road as living rooms, workshops, shops, or warehouses. However, this rule does not apply to those who have applied to the French Public Works Bureau and have been approved. Article 2. All applications should be reviewed by the Board of Directors of the French Public Works Bureau and submitted to the Consul General for a decision. Article 3. The above permission is not of a permanent nature. If its neighbors or the Director General of the French Police Department raise reasonable objections, the Board of Directors of the French Public Works Bureau may adopt the opinions and revoke the permission at any time. Article 4. Anyone who violates these regulations shall be fined from five to one hundred yuan, and those living in the garage may be ordered to move out by the police station.</p>
<p>Four Associations of Iron Industry, etc.</p>
<p>The City Federation and the Women and Children Education and Care Institute Will Continue to Fundraise and Broadcast Today</p>
<p>The four associations of the iron industry, hardware industry, steel bar and old iron industry, and copper and tin industry in this city have previously decided to handle refugee donations, stipulating that one cent of refugee donation will be collected for every hundred catties. It has now been decided that it will be implemented tomorrow (the 21st). All donation books and receipts have been received from the Industry Promotion Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday. The association has always been enthusiastic about disaster relief work, and it is expected that there will be considerable achievements.</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation Relief Refugee Committee broadcast a fundraising campaign for the Women and Children Education and Care Institute yesterday for the second day. Donations from all walks of life were very enthusiastic. Yesterday, committee members Zhang Yichen, Gu Yucang, and Wang Jingdong gave speeches on the radio. Today, it will continue to be held at the Washington Radio Station. The programs include Beiping comedy, Yue opera Shen opera, and stories, all of which are extremely exciting. All sectors are also welcome to request songs.</p>

<p>To Undertake Relief, Medical Treatment, Burial for Refugees; To Depart for the Yangtze River Basin in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei Provinces</p>
<p>Various charity organizations in this city, considering that since the outbreak of war in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, relief efforts have been difficult to implement due to transportation difficulties, and with the arrival of early spring, the work of refugee relief, burial of exposed corpses, and medical treatment for the poor and sick are urgently needed, it is heard that all parties have now agreed to jointly organize a mobile relief team composed of various charity organizations in this city, selecting competent staff to undertake various relief tasks. Once the organization is ready, it can depart. The destinations are said to include areas along the Yangtze River in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei.</p>
<p>French Military Commander in Shanghai</p>
<p>To Relinquish Post Periodically</p>
<p>Colonel Granié to Succeed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Colonel Bourgeois, the French military commander in Shanghai, has served for nearly three years. His successor, Colonel Granié, is coming to Shanghai from Vietnam and is expected to arrive on Tuesday. Before leaving office, Colonel Bourgeois plans to take a short vacation in Japan and is scheduled to depart at the end of this week. After returning to Shanghai, he will formally hand over the command, at which time a grand ceremony will be held. All units of the French army in Shanghai will be present, and senior officials from diplomatic and consular offices may also participate. Colonel Bourgeois arrived in Shanghai in 1936 to serve as the French military commander.</p>

<p>Anticipating Severe Malaria Epidemic This Summer; To Be Unloaded in Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that a member of the American Advisory Committee in Shanghai told reporters yesterday (the 18th) that the American Red Cross has donated two million tablets of quinine to Chinese refugees, which have now been shipped to China. He believes that the Chinese Red Cross, which is actively fighting malaria and other diseases in the mainland, has appealed for donations of medicines. The committee member explained that due to the influx of refugees suffering from malaria into the mainland, the disease is rapidly spreading from one area to another. Therefore, a severe malaria epidemic is expected this summer. To distinguish the medicine, all tablets are colored blue. The boxes are also labeled to indicate that the tablets inside are donated by the American Red Cross. They will be unloaded in Hong Kong and then transported to the mainland by the Chinese Red Cross. As for the crushed wheat recently shipped to China by the American Red Cross, there are still about nine thousand bags left here. Chinese refugees enjoy eating it, and even the poor people in South China who are accustomed to eating rice have repeatedly requested continued donations.</p>

<p>Chinese Troops Stationed at Various Ports; Foreign Ships Sail Frequently</p>
<p>The inland ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been under Japanese control. Regulations stipulate that foreign ships must obtain navigation permits before sailing. Most foreign merchants refuse to cooperate and have announced the suspension of navigation. Inland merchants have also ceased doing business due to the Japanese puppet regime's control over exports, requiring export permits, and the illegal collection of taxes at various ports, which are unbearable. They have switched to transporting goods through ports stationed by Chinese troops. Therefore, ports such as Beisha, Songji Port, Sanhe Port, Hutong Port, Niuhong Port, Shuji Port, Da'an Port, Laohong Port, Xingang Port, Lingxun Port, and Dongyi Port, which are still under the control of the puppet guerrillas, have become the central points for the transfer of inland cargo. Foreign shipping companies have dispatched ships to sail frequently. According to investigations, there are more than ten foreign ships sailing, including Yihe, Tonghe, Deyao, Daxin, Lisha, Haiyi, Sanbei, and Hongyun, with five or six ships traveling back and forth daily. The Beisha route has now become the most prosperous route in the inland ports. Although the Xingang route is still operating as usual, the number of passenger and freight ships has sharply decreased, with only seven or eight ships sailing.</p>
<p>Puppet Ye Dingxin</p>
<p>Plots to Become Puppet "Vice Minister"</p>
<p>It has been learned that Ye Dingxin, the chief of the general affairs department of the puppet Provisional Government's Ministry of Industry, who previously came to Shanghai to organize a puppet trademark bureau, is now seeking to become the puppet Minister of Industry with the support of certain forces.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Toxic Atmosphere Pervades Shanghai's Suburbs; Opium Dens Established Everywhere <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Four More Added in Nanshi and Zhabei; Establishment of "Lida Company" to Materialize Soon</p>
<p>(Modern News Agency) Opium dealer Jiang Yumen, who was wanted by the Songhu Garrison Command for years due to his involvement in the red pill trafficking case, recently sneaked into Shanghai from Shantou and colluded with famous opium merchants Zheng Chuanying and Liu Zheran from Chaozhou, raising capital of 100,000 yuan to establish a general bureau for selling opium in western Shanghai, implementing a policy of poisoning the people. Its main office was originally located at No. 6 Xinkang Lane, Caojiadu. However, after receiving warnings from patriotic groups, it was immediately moved to Renhe Lane, Wujiaochang, to continue operating. Jiang and Liu serve as general and deputy managers, respectively, with a Mr. Li representing them in all negotiations. In addition to signing a contract with the Japanese to sell five large boxes of opium daily, they have recently established branches in Pudong, Hongkou, Nanshi, and Zhabei to facilitate the transportation of opium. All opium businesses in the occupied areas are now under their control. The toxic atmosphere is pervasive and intensifying, with no hope in sight for the people. Furthermore, opium dealers Zheng Chunhe and Guo Bosun also plan to establish a large-scale opium trafficking organization in western Shanghai. After several rounds of negotiations, they have made smooth progress and named it "Lida Company." It has a substantial capital, and the office is currently located in the Broadway Mansions in Hongkou. Once the procedures with certain parties are completed and a business license is obtained, it can be realized.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Shanghai Refugee Relief Association (Continued) (Yesterday) Policies on Managing Shelters <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>It must be understood that refugees are not slaves, let alone prisoners. Refugees are people who have suffered during national crises, a general term for those who have suffered within war zones. The only difference is that there are refugees in shelters, refugees not in shelters, and even refugees like us serving in refugee shelters. Everyone must understand that refugees in shelters are not a different kind of people, but compatriots who stand in the same position as us. Therefore, the enthusiastic donations of people from all walks of life and our service to the majority of refugees are all about fulfilling our mutual assistance obligations. Even Westerners are doing their best to help us, let alone our own people.</p>
<p>Some things are heavier than Mount Tai, and some are lighter than a feather. The resignation of Mr. Cai and Mr. Wang a few days ago was indeed justifiable. The future work is indeed more important than the positions they resigned from. Moreover, both gentlemen had stated before coming here to work that they were only helping out temporarily. Therefore, the farewell ceremony was very grand, not only to respect the two gentlemen but also to encourage colleagues to work hard. Unexpectedly, after Cai and Wang, anyone who has other work immediately resigns, regardless of whether they are responsible or whether someone else can take over. Now there is Zhang Yiyi, who, while serving in the shelter, was reprimanded and recorded for abusing refugees and disobeying the director's orders after investigation. Last night, he left without permission and went to other places. The contents of the letter he left behind are even more unreasonable. Such irresponsibility and disobedience will not lead to good results even if he works elsewhere. His unpaid monthly salary will be used as a donation to refugees as a warning to others. If anyone still intends to resign and take on other tasks, you must declare it today so that we can prepare for replacements as soon as possible. Otherwise, I cannot leave my job without permission. You must know that this shelter is not a place for you to rest temporarily, so we cannot allow you to come and go as you please.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the meager treatment first. As far as I know, compared with other shelters, our association is still relatively high. Those of you who have served in other shelters must know that. As for the work of collecting badges and numbering refugees, it must be completed within two days. Deliver it to Mr. Chen Yuze of the Standard Company to make it, distribute and hang it, so that the photos of the adopted refugees can also be completed as soon as possible (to be continued).</p>

Years ago, he married a woman surnamed in Nanshi, but after marriage, the couple had no feelings and soon divorced. Recently, through an introduction, he married another woman surnamed, who was only nineteen years old.

<p>Defendants Still Trying to Evade Responsibility, Proven True by Fellow Villagers; Jurong Bandit Gang Robbing Military Funds Case Concluded, Awaiting Sentence</p>
<p>New Fourth Army Division Commander Liang Zuocheng, a native of Guangdong, his sixteen-year-old son, and three guards were carrying 327,000 yuan in military funds in December of the previous year when they passed through Qiaoxiang Village, Jurong County, Jiangsu Province. They were murdered by local bandits (the ringleaders Da Yuanlin and five others have already been executed) and the military funds were robbed. The case was reported by a Chinese detective Shang Wu of the Huishi Police Department, who received a secret report from Chinese Constable No. 121, and the suspects were arrested in Hankou Road, Shanxi Road, and other places.</p>
<p>The Jurong bandits, except for Chen Qiaosheng, who was found to be innocent and released on bail, the remaining four, Dai Hongfu, Chen Heshang, Chen Bosheng, and Qiao Changjin, were sent to the First Special District Court. The Jiangsu High Court branch ruled that the case could be tried and interrogated. All details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng specially opened the Criminal Court No. 3 to conduct the trial, and police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that Detective Shang Wu of the Huishi Police Department was in court and could state the circumstances of the</p>
<p>arrest at that time, as well as the confessions of the defendants at the police station. According to Detective Shang, he received a report from Chinese Constable No. 121 that he first arrested the defendant Dai Hongfu on Hankou Road, who confessed to the other three defendants, Chen Heshang, Chen Bosheng, and Qiao Changjin, who were subsequently arrested. Chen Heshang once escaped in front of a barber shop in North Shanxi Road but was later apprehended. Dai Hongfu admitted at the police station that he plotted to</p>
<p>murder Division Commander Liang and received 150 yuan each after the money was obtained, but this money was not given by Village Chief Da Yuanlin, who instead ordered him to stand guard near Qiaoxiang Village. In court, the four defendants were ordered to be interrogated separately, but the defendants Dai Hongfu and others overturned their confessions at the police station and firmly denied them. According to Chinese Constable No. 121, before the incident, he went to the Xi Qing Chi Bathhouse in Jiujiang Road to take a bath. The bathhouse attendants Mai Baogen, Zhang Heshang, and Shen Zhigao said that their fellow villagers</p>
<p>Dai Hongfu and others had plotted to murder a division commander in Qiaoxiang Village, Jurong, and that he could report this to the police station. He said yes and accompanied the deceased Gao Binghui and Jia and other three attendants to report to the Huishi Police Department. Detective Shang arrested the defendants. He said that if he had been delayed by one more day, the suspects would have gone to a certain place in Yangzhou and would not have been arrested. In court, the three attendants Jia, Zhang, and Shen were called to testify and still stated the same. After the investigation, Dai Hongfu and Qiao Changjin swore they were innocent. The court ordered the start of arguments, and the police lawyer</p>
<p>Zhang Tianyin said</p>
<p>that the police department was prosecuting this case for robbery and murder, but the circumstances were still different. The defendants were large-scale bandits organized by Da Yuanlin, the village chief of Qiaoxiang Village, Jurong. They dared to murder national superior officers and rob military funds, which was lawless, heinous, and extremely sinful. He requested that the most severe punishment be imposed. Judge Huang ordered the four defendants Dai Hongfu and others to be returned to prison to await sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>

<p>Unanimously Indignant at Planned Murders; Eighteen Suspects Arrested in Qin Gongcheng Case</p>
<p>In the past ten days, taxi drivers Rong Dingshan, Zhu Linggen, and others from various taxi companies in this city have been killed in Hongkou, which is unspeakable. All the drivers of the Taxi Drivers' Amateur Association, although they make a living from their profession, how can they hide their indignation and be willing to be harmed in the face of this planned attack? Therefore, all the drivers of Tailai and Yunfei companies, in addition to mourning the deceased colleagues, have also made serious representations and unanimously refused to drive to Hongkou. The funeral for the late driver Zhu Linggen was held at the Public Funeral Home at the end of Jiaozhou Road and Changping Road at 8 am on the 20th. The burial will be held at 2 pm. It is hoped that all circles will sympathize.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports</p>
<p>that yesterday (the 18th), it was learned that a certain car of Tailai Automobile Company carried several passengers from a hotel on Nanjing Road to a certain place in Hongkou on Sunday, and was assassinated that night. Yesterday, all the drivers of Tailai Company refused to carry passengers to any place north of the Suzhou River. Although the drivers of Yunfei Automobile Company were still willing to cross the Suzhou River, by dusk, the reporter asked a certain member of the company, who said that if there were foreigners</p>
<p>wanting to go to Hongkou</p>
<p>and Yangshupu districts in the evening, the drivers should decide for themselves whether or not to take them. It is heard that after the drivers of Tailai Company learned that a certain driver of the company was assassinated in the car, they held a meeting, and the employees reached this decision. A meeting was held on Friday night, but no definite resolution was reached. However, a committee has been elected to study this issue and convey their opinions to the drivers yesterday morning. It was rumored last night that the drivers of Yunfei Company may also refuse to drive to Hongkou after Monday. The</p>
<p>circumstances of the murders</p>
<p>of the two taxi drivers were quite similar. First, a driver of Yunfei Company was strangled and his body was found on the 6th of this month in the garden of an empty house on Jilin Road. The stolen car was also found parked near the Xinya Hotel on Tiantong Road. In the second assassination case, the driver's body was found in a pile of rubble next to Donghanbi Road, and the stolen car was also found near the first place where the stolen car was found. A few days ago, it was said that this kind of assassination</p>
<p>was to intimidate</p>
<p>the drivers of American cars so that they would not dare to operate in Hongkou and other areas north of the Suzhou River. These areas have small cars operated by Japanese and Koreans. According to the North China Daily News, taxi driver Tai Gongcheng (transliteration), 41 years old, was assassinated. His body was found on an open space next to Dinghai Road on the morning of the 12th of this month. Regarding this case, it was learned from reliable sources that by Friday night (the 17th), the Yangshupu Police Department had arrested eighteen suspects. As for the names of the suspects and the nature of the suspicions for which they were arrested, it was still unknown yesterday, but it is believed that they are now</p>
<p>under interrogation.</p>
<p>When the taxi driver's body was found, there were traces of elm tree injuries on his head. According to the investigation, it is generally believed that the murderer had stolen the driver's car. As of late last night, what could be confirmed was that the stolen car had not been found. It is believed that the car has left Shanghai, and the police are continuing the investigation.</p>
<p>Failed to Cancel Engagement</p>
<h3 id="e80">Man Requests Compensation for Damages <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Appeal Judgment: Should Compensate National Currency 300 Yuan</p>
<p>Fan Qiupu, a native of Zhenjiang, who lives at No. 47 Hengmao Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession, and is now a clerk at Zhongfu Coal Mine, is a Christian. He is 28 years old this year. In 1936, through a matchmaker's introduction, he engaged Ma Yuxian, a native of Yong who lived at No. 5 Bing'an Lane, Nanchujiaqiao, Alige Road (24 years old this year). At that time, both parties were engaged at the Jinlingchun Restaurant on Fujian Road, English Concession. Later, Ma Yuxian suddenly hired a lawyer to</p>
<p>publish in the newspaper, claiming that</p>
<p>this marriage was advocated by her parents and was not with her own consent. She wanted to cancel the engagement. On the one hand, the woman also asked the court to mediate and cancel the engagement. As a result, the mediation failed, and on the other hand, Fan Qiupu, last year, entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Ma Yuxian to confirm the validity of the engagement. The case was finalized after three trials in the Second Branch of the High Court and the Supreme Court, and it was ruled that the engagement between the two parties was valid. However, Fan chose a day to welcome the bride, but the marriage could not proceed smoothly due to the woman's opposition. Fan Qiupu again filed a</p>
<p>claim for damages</p>
<p>against Ma Yuxian in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, seeking to recover damages of 1,000 yuan. The initial trial rejected the plaintiff's claim. Fan Qiupu, dissatisfied with the judgment, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. After the court summoned both parties and witnesses for trial, it announced the end of the debate. The main text of the judgment issued the day before yesterday stated that the original judgment was revoked, and the appellant's claim for the amount stated later against Ma Yuxian and the portion of the litigation costs were changed. The appellee Ma Yuxian should compensate the appellant with 300 yuan in national currency. The remaining appeals were rejected. The appellant should bear 70% of the first and second instance litigation costs, and the appellee should bear 30%.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Car Transporting Opium Case; Hunting Down the Principal Offender <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 15th, Chinese and Western detectives of the French Police Station seized a No. 245 public car transporting opium while checking pedestrians at the intersection of Julieda Road and Mai Sixiai Road. After taking Tongzhou native Wang Lemen, who was carrying opium, and the driver Qu Linqing, to the police station, according to their confessions, they continued to arrest accomplices Gu Zhengxiang, Zhang Rongjiang, Zhang Xiaogen, etc. It was found that the car belonged to the late Lou Ziyun, the former captain of the detective team of the Shanghai Police Station. The police station sent the arrested criminals to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, investigation and re-interrogation, and an arrest warrant was issued for the fugitive Zhang Baocheng to be brought to justice. All the news has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the fugitive principal offender Zhang Shicheng's house is richly decorated and equipped with a telephone. Usually, transactions of opium are secretly negotiated on the phone. The police station has sent detectives to search and wait at his home to arrest him. It is hereby urgently attached to this correction to apologize for the previous report involving Liu Yunfang, i.e., Liu Ziyun, which was actually Lou Ziyun.</p>
<p>Car and Tram Collide</p>
<p>At about 1:30 pm yesterday, at Wangjiasha, Jing'an Temple Road, English Concession, a black-licensed car was driving east from the west. At that time, a tram was coming from the opposite direction. Due to the failure to avoid it, a collision occurred, and traffic was blocked for half an hour before it returned to normal.</p>

<p>If You Do Not Close Your Doors, All Will Be Bombed; Hollywood Gambling Den Bombing Injures Six</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that outside of Yelu and other areas in the Western District beyond the boundaries, the Japanese-controlled areas have been plastered with giant notices written by guerrillas and anti-Japanese elements with official red seals, stating that if opium dens, gambling dens, and flower association factories in the area do not close their doors, they will all be bombed. If this is not just intimidation, then bomb attacks and shootings will occur again in the Western District in the next few days. According to a Chinese resident in the Western District, the sea strike team in the area often goes to various shops, not to ask for donations, but to politely explain their legitimate responsibilities. It is also heard that many guerrillas are carrying guns and walking calmly on the road.</p>
<p>Increased Taxes, Successive Closures</p>
<p>The gambling dens on the roads built beyond the boundaries of western Shanghai all have business licenses issued by the Japanese. There are as many as twenty-five in western Shanghai. Each pays a daily protection fee of 150 yuan, euphemistically called entertainment venues. Sasaki is responsible for supervising the entertainment venues. It is heard that this license fee has now increased, divided into 200 yuan, 300 yuan, and 400 yuan, collected daily. The owners of various gambling dens, in view of the frequent occurrence of terrorist incidents recently, and the gamblers are now hesitant, and now they also increase the license fee, and the expenses are huge, and they cannot maintain it. Therefore, there are already several who have voluntarily closed down.</p>
<p>Hollywood Bombing Injures Six</p>
<p>Also, gambling dens in western Shanghai such as Hollywood, Rongsheng, and Guangsheng, etc., have received warning letters for several days, ordering them to close immediately, otherwise drastic measures will be taken. It is now learned that at 4 pm the day before yesterday (the 17th), when the Hollywood gambling den was "listing" and gamblers were enthusiastically gathering, a strong man suddenly came in and threw a hand grenade at the gambling table. It exploded immediately. The gamblers were unable to escape and six were injured by the bombing on the site. The puppet police station was reported to go to search and send the injured to a certain hospital for treatment. As for the strong man who threw the bomb, he had escaped in the chaos. The puppet police searched and found nothing. Also on the same day and at the same time, two strong men with weapons suddenly broke into the Guangsheng gambling den and tried to do something. When they were discovered, the two strong men immediately disappeared.</p>
<p>Opium and Gambling Dens on High Alert</p>
<p>In Caohjiadu and other places beyond the boundaries of Yelu in western Shanghai, gangsters use special forces to openly set up opium and gambling venues, poisoning the society. Recently, the owners of various opium and gambling dens and opium shops have received warning letters from the China Elimination of Traitors Corps and are terrified. Most of them are hiding elsewhere and living in seclusion, not daring to go to the opium and gambling dens and opium shops they set up. The puppet police station has also dispatched puppet police to strengthen security at the gates of various gambling venues and opium shops. Since the day before yesterday, newly established Japanese military police uniforms (newly established) puppet police, wearing knives and guns, have been dispatched to stand guard at the entrance of each gambling den or opium shop. On the one hand, the owners of opium and gambling dens have hired many burly men to protect the gambling venues.</p>

<p>Eleven Born, All Completely Dead; Chopping Off Leg Bones So They Won't Be Reincarnated; Police Station Prosecutes for Murder</p>
<p>Cai Heshang (49 years old) and Cai Xu (48 years old), a couple from Jiangbei who live at No. 108, Alley 87, Kangnaot Road, chopped off the leg bones of their sick baby Cai Xiaoya (their own daughter, only 56 days old) with an ax on the open space behind the public toilet of the Shanghai Municipal Council near Wuding Road, Tokyo Road, at 3 pm on the 13th of this month. She died of her injuries and was arrested by the Gordon Road Police Station. Yesterday, they were prosecuted by the First Special Court for murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Judge Huang Risheng took the seat to hear the case. The defendant Cai Heshang confessed, "I make a living as a rickshaw puller. Including the daughter who died now, I have given birth to eleven children in total, and none of them survived. We have a superstition in our hometown that children who cannot be raised are 'debt collectors.' If you don't use harsh methods against them, they will still be reincarnated. This child was only fifty days old when she was born, and she was sick. She saw a doctor every day. On the afternoon of the 13th, she died again. My wife was holding her in her arms and crying. I was very angry, so I took the body of this 'debt collector' to the open space on Tokyo Road and chopped off her right leg bone with an ax. Who would have thought that when I chopped down with an ax, she came back to life and was calling. I was very scared in my heart, suspecting that the 'debt collector' was showing up. I threw the ax at her body and ran back." At this point in the interrogation, the court turned to Cai Xu for questioning. The defendant was then ordered to be returned to custody, and the case was scheduled for re-interrogation on the 25th of this month when the autopsy report arrived.</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Case of the Assassination of Tang Jiapeng: The Culprit Cannot be Found for Questioning <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Gu Zhuxuan Case Has Been Suspended</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, an elderly man from Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, and head of the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association at the Tianchan Stage, was accused by Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, the assassins of Tang Jiapeng, while they were in prison, of being an instigator. Consequently, the French Concession police arrested Gu on September 10th, the 24th year of the Republic [1935], and escorted him to the Second District Court's Criminal Tribunal. A public prosecution was initiated against him for the crime of instigating murder. The case was heard by the former Criminal Tribunal President, Wang Gangxu, who sentenced him to fifteen years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Gu Did Not Accept the Verdict</p>
<p>And appealed to the Third High Branch Court. After the court's review, on June 26th, the 26th year of the Republic [1937], he was declared innocent. However, he was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment for opium use in prison, a sentence that was confirmed. After serving his sentence, he was released on bail for 15,000 yuan concerning the accusation of instigating murder. The French Concession police, regarding Gu's</p>
<p>Declaration of Innocence, expressed dissatisfaction and submitted a petition to the Third High Branch Court's Prosecutor's Office, requesting that they appeal to the Supreme Court on their behalf, seeking to punish Gu with the crime he deserved. After review by the Supreme Court, the original verdict was overturned in the summer of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], and the case was remanded to the Third High Branch Court for a new trial. After "August 13th" [the start of the Battle of Shanghai], the Third High Branch Court summoned him once and instructed him to await a scheduled date for</p>
<p>Further Questioning. It is now learned that because the accusers in the case, Zhao Guangfu, Zhang Tinggui, and others, were assigned to serve on the front lines from the Second Prison under the jurisdiction of Beixinjing when the Shanghai war broke out and have since disappeared, the case cannot proceed and has been suspended. The situation of the case being unable to proceed has been reported to the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court for verification. Furthermore, it is reported that the main suspect in the</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng Assassination Case, Wang Xinggao from Funing, was initially sentenced to life imprisonment, but the second trial declared him innocent. After the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Third High Branch Court for a new trial, Wang was also released on bail for 20,000 yuan. The Third High Branch Court repeatedly summoned him without success and has confiscated the bail. It is rumored that Wang Xinggao has become a traitor and has been killed by guerrillas in Jiangbei.</p>
<p>Worker's Legs Severed</p>
<p>At approximately 7:45 PM last night, a worker-like Zhang Huichun was passing through the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Zhejiang Road when he was run over by a Route 9 public bus, resulting in the fracture of both legs. Bleeding profusely, he suffered severe injuries. The patrol police arrived after hearing the news and promptly used an ambulance to transport him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but his chances of survival are slim.</p>
<p>Apprentice Commits Suicide by Swallowing Smoke</p>
<p>Dong Qilin, a native of Chongming, is currently twenty years old and works at the Wuzhou Shoes and Hats Shop on Zhejiang Road, earning only three yuan a month. His family is extremely poor, and recently, he was inexplicably influenced and contemplated suicide. Yesterday afternoon, he secretly swallowed a large amount of weight-producing smoke to commit suicide. Later, his colleagues at the shop discovered this and called the patrol police at No. 98, who summoned an ambulance to transport him to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, many cultural figures have been diligently fulfilling their responsibilities. Recently, Ren Jinping, Mao Zipei, and Feng Mengyun of the press have taken positions at the Translation Report, Wenhui News, and other publications, respectively. Coinciding with Yu Kongwo of the News commencing his legal practice, their four friends, Fan Shucai, Lai Lansheng, Chen Tingchao, Lu Yifang, and others, initiated a public banquet for the four at the Tongxing Restaurant yesterday (the 19th) at 6:00 PM.

<h3 id="e86">Gambling Den Owner Loses Money and Resorts to Infighting, Opening Fire <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Gao Jingen, a 34-year-old native of Suzhou, residing at No. 64 Yong'an Lane, Difeng Road, in western Shanghai, was very friendly with Mr. Wang, the owner of the "Yongyuan Company" gambling den near Caojiadu. Before the den opened, Mr. Wang lacked capital, and Gao, due to his active involvement in illicit activities around Yong'an Lane, had some savings. Therefore, Wang persuaded Gao to become a partner. In addition, Gao lent Wang 700 yuan as Wang's capital. Unexpectedly, after the den opened, business was poor. Recently, due to the Huajun Special Operations Team actively cracking down and warning various gambling dens and opium dens to close down quickly or face punishment, most gamblers hesitated to visit, and the gambling dens became desolate, plummeting in business. The Yongyuan gambling den was particularly deserted and declining. Gao Jingen, witnessing his investment possibly becoming worthless, became anxious and went to Yongyuan around 7:00 PM yesterday to demand repayment of the loan from Wang. However, Wang denied it, claiming that the money was Gao's share of the capital. This led to a dispute between the two, and they roared at each other in the den's accounting room, refusing to yield. Unable to reach an agreement, they resorted to violence. Mr. Wang, seized by murderous intent, took out a concealed handgun and fired six shots at Gao. Fortunately, Gao dodged effectively and was only hit once in the right arm, allowing him to escape. However, still indignant, he reported the incident to the Concession police, who dispatched Chinese police officer No. 252 to send him to the hospital for treatment and to investigate the truth and pursue the culprit.</p>

<p>To the Esteemed Editor, We are writing in response to a statement from our client, Ms. Zheng Songliangzhao, who has read the news article titled "Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law as Strangers: Elderly Woman Sues for Support" in your newspaper on January 15th. The article stated that Ms. Zheng has always had disagreements with her mother-in-law, Ms. Cheng, so Ms. Cheng, now over seventy years old, still lives separately at No. 74 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao. Not only are the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law like strangers, but the three grandsons, following their mother's instructions, also do not know to offer filial piety. It also claimed that the daughter-in-law is wealthy but never provides any assistance. This is inconsistent with the facts. Ms. Zheng and her mother-in-law, Ms. Cheng, have always been harmonious. Since Ms. Cheng moved to Shanghai, eight years have passed. Besides personally visiting Ms. Cheng to inquire about her well-being, she has also instructed her children to visit their grandmother regularly to provide care. The claim of long-standing disagreements is not factual. Furthermore, after the death of the late Mr. Shunian, the land rent he left behind, besides the 196 piculs taken by Ms. Cheng as sustenance, included more than 200 piculs that were inherited and benefited from by Mr. Gongwu, Ms. Zheng's husband. After her husband's death, she has been living on this income. The expenses for daily necessities, food, clothing, and the children's education have been extremely difficult to manage. As for the inherited shops, most of them have experienced poor business after her husband inherited them and have closed down one after another within a year, resulting in no income. During this time of national crisis, rent collection has decreased, and the hardship is beyond description. Moreover, in mid-November of last winter, she jointly withdrew 14 mu of farmland from the safety deposit box with Ms. Cheng as a mortgage for 1,000 yuan for Ms. Cheng. The claim that the daughter-in-law is wealthy but never provides any assistance is also inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, we have been specially entrusted by your lawyer to make corrections in order to set the record straight. We hereby respectfully request that you publish this letter in the Letters to the Editor section. Sincerely, Attorney Peng Zhongjun, March 18th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I am writing regarding the news article published in your newspaper on the 18th, which stated that the sale of opium was requested by Zhang Baocheng, the owner of the Xiechang Fruit Shop at No. 400 Foch Road.

Therefore, I am extremely surprised and fear that the public will misunderstand, which would greatly affect the reputation of my small business. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Chen Yusheng, Xiechang Fruit Shop.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Promoting the Children's One-Cent Donation Campaign <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Yucai</p>
<p>There are still 100,000 refugees in Shanghai. These 100,000 refugees rely on the efforts of the Refugee Relief Association to solicit donations to maintain their lives. Almost everyone knows and appreciates the Refugee Relief Association. But can the association itself succeed? It cannot succeed. The association is empty. Its success depends entirely on the enthusiastic donations of people from all walks of life in Shanghai. It requires all the people of Shanghai, with one heart and one mind, to contribute money and effort, and to care about the lives of the displaced. Only in this way can the association succeed. When we look at the association's published income and expenditure reports in the newspaper, we can see that the amount of donations is quite considerable. However, because there are so many people who need relief, the distribution is not very generous. The future is long, and how will it continue? This is a problem. The refugees are all our dear compatriots, and we should all stand up and take responsibility to solve their living problems.</p>
<p>April 4th is Children's Day, an annual event. This year is the eighth. In the past, there were grand celebrations every Children's Day. The Children's Day this year has also been initiated and prepared by various children's education organizations. I personally believe that the celebration ceremony can be simple, but we should take this opportunity to promote thrift and promote a one-cent relief campaign. Speaking of this, some people may misunderstand that the donations in schools are too heavy. Sometimes there is a one-yuan charity donation, sometimes there is a thrift and relief donation, and sometimes there is a one-cent relief donation. The economic conditions of the children are very ordinary. Where do they have so much surplus money? This sounds very good on the surface, but it is wrong after careful analysis. The one-yuan charity donation is only once. It is used as a production education fund for the displaced, and it is not necessarily forced to donate. The total number of students in all large, medium, and small schools in Shanghai is about 300,000, but the goal is only set at 100,000 yuan. This means that some of the poorer students are expected to be exempt from donating. Moreover, it is now the end of the result, and there will be no more one-yuan charity donations in the future. Thrift and relief donations and one-cent relief donations are two sides of the same coin, but the one-cent relief donation is more specific. It is not very difficult for a child to save one cent a day. We only need to look at the business situation of consumer cooperatives in many schools to see that children are fully capable of contributing a one-cent donation. Donating one cent per person per day is three cents per month. Thinking of the last time the citizens' group launched a fundraising campaign to adopt displaced people, knowing that donating two yuan per month can save one person's monthly living expenses, wouldn't two children be able to save one displaced person? "Many grains of sand make a tower, and many fox furs make a robe." This is absolutely correct. It looks like it is only one cent, but the effect is very great. Children of Shanghai, I believe you are all enthusiastic. Starting today, implement a one-cent donation campaign. 100,000 displaced people are eagerly expecting you.</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Words of a Newspaper Vendor (Continued) <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Xiangsheng, Tenth Newspaper Vendor School</p>
<p>After getting the newspapers, I hurry to the bus stop on Connaught Road and Xiaoshadu Road to sell them. At that time, many gentlemen who worked in offices went to work, so business was not bad. However, sometimes it is inevitable that you will not be able to sell them all. When they are about to be sold out, you have to deliver the newspapers to the homes of subscribers. Your feet do not allow you to be lazy at all. What newspaper vendors hate the most is rainy days. Sometimes the weather is very good when you leave home. Unfortunately, when you get the newspapers to sell, it starts to rain heavily. You don't have an umbrella, so you undo the buttons on your body and put the newspapers in your chest. The ruthless raindrops hit you, and you are drenched all over. It is very uncomfortable. A weak body may catch a cold and get sick. If you walk faster on a rainy road, there is a real danger of slipping and falling. Therefore, it is inevitable that the time for delivering newspapers will be delayed. If you meet a good subscriber, they won't say anything. However, some impatient gentlemen will ask why the newspapers were delivered so late. They can't know the reason and the reason why several newspaper offices publish late. Really, sometimes the newspaper offices have to wait for news or other reasons until very late before they publish. This makes the newspaper vendors suffer. Not only do they have to run like a race on the road, but they also have to be blamed by the subscribers. Therefore, I think it would be good if the newspaper offices could publish the newspapers before 7:00 AM, because some subscribers don't know the reason why we deliver the newspapers late and think that the newspaper vendors are lazy. Because we are short of time, we don't have time to explain in detail, so we have to vaguely say that we will deliver them earlier tomorrow.</p>
<p>After delivering all the newspapers to the subscribers, your feet can finally get a chance to rest. The whole morning is spent in a hurry. It can also be said that you have spent a day as a newspaper vendor.</p>
<p>But there are also those who sell the evening newspapers together. Of course, you can earn more money, but you have to work harder physically. Newspaper vendors with large families have to work harder to maintain their family life. (The End)</p>

<p>— Reflection</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia has been established for twenty years. During the First European War, thanks to the leadership of Masaryk and the courageous struggle of the people, Czechoslovakia was created. It was really not easy. As a result of twenty years of hard work, Czechoslovakia can also be called a powerful country. Its industrial development and exquisite military industry are especially praised by the world. Therefore, when Czechoslovakia is mentioned, people immediately think of its products. Its prevalence can be imagined.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia has a population of 14 million and a land area of 140,000 kilometers. It is a very small country. Its location is between Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and other countries. It borders the strong neighbor Germany and is adjacent to Hungary, Romania, Poland, and other countries. Therefore, the prosperity of Czechoslovakia could have increased the courage of small and weak nations. However, it is inevitable that it will be envied by strong neighbors. When Germany and Italy tried every means to expand their power in Europe, Czechoslovakia had already been considered a piece of fat. In addition to the fact that many lands were ceded to Germany, Hungary, and Poland last year, the problem of the declaration of independence by the Slovak Province and the Carpathian Ukraine Province has caused disintegration. The remaining provinces of Bohemia and Moravia have been occupied by Germany, so Czechoslovakia has been broken and fallen.</p>
<p>This incident originated from the disputes between the Slavic ethnic group and the Czech ethnic group. There are many Slavic ethnic groups living in the Slovak Province of Czechoslovakia. This ethnic group and the soldiers' living habits are incompatible, and conflicts often occur. After Germany annexed the Sudetenland, it helped the Slavic ethnic group to carry out an independence movement in Czechoslovakia, wanting to first make the Slavic Province and Carpathian Province become German vassals, and continue to pave the way for the eastward advance and attack the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, the facts were beyond expectations. Under German pressure, Czechoslovakia allowed the Slovak Province and the Carpathian Province to become independent, and even asked Germany to protect the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia. Therefore, the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia were immediately allowed to be driven straight in by the German army and declared dissolution. When the news came, the world was shocked.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia has fallen, but the fall of Czechoslovakia did not fire a shot or spend a bullet, which is sad. We believe that the fall of Czechoslovakia was due to Britain and France, because the British and French governments repeatedly tolerated aggression in order to seek temporary peace, which made Czechoslovakia unable to recover. It not only fueled the arrogance of fascism, but also backfired, harming others and not benefiting themselves. It is really a pity. But Czechoslovakia itself is also to blame for not adhering to its own position and relying on others to mediate. If Czechoslovakia had taken the initiative to strengthen its spirit, unite the people, and fight to the death before the Four-Power Conference, the result would not necessarily have been the fall of the country. Even if it was defeated and destroyed, it would have paid a considerable price, which would have been more colorful compared to the current situation of swallowing its breath. Moreover, the war might not have led to the destruction of the country.</p>
<p>Scientific Experiment</p>
<h3 id="e95">An Interesting Toy <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaohong</p>
<p>Now let me introduce an interesting toy. This toy is not my creation. It is extracted from books. However, this toy is related to optics. Understanding the mystery of it can let us know the mystery of light and vision. Although it is not an important thing, it is just a toy, but it contains scientific truth. Readers may wish to study it carefully.</p>
<p>Cut a small round piece of cardboard, about two inches wide and three inches long, and draw an object on each side. For example, draw a birdcage on the front of the paper and a bird on the back, and then tie a string to each side of the round paper. Now use your fingers to twist the string to make the round paper rotate rapidly, and the bird will be seen in the cage (see figure). This experiment is very interesting. If students are interested, they can do it according to this. Not only can it be used as a toy, but it can also arouse students' interest in research. It is also strange that it is clearly a bird on one side and a cage on the other. The two are unrelated things. After a few degrees of movement, the bird will get into the cage. Isn't it a strange thing? However, if you study its reason, it is not difficult to discover its scientific mystery, because when we usually look at things with our eyes, the image of the object is reflected on the retina of our eyeballs. At this time, if you suddenly move the object away, the image does not disappear immediately, but can be temporarily retained on the retina. This phenomenon is called "afterimage" in science. When the paper is rotating, the cage image that remains on our retina has not had time to disappear, and the bird image is immediately reflected on the retina, so the result is that the two are superimposed, and we see it as if the bird is in the cage.</p>
<p>Readers can now know the general idea of the above experiment. This is originally a very ordinary thing. An ordinary card is drawn according to the method and then turned to persuade it to work. But the reason is to use the afterimage effect of the retina of our eyeballs to get a continuous illusion. In this way, it seems that there is nothing unusual, but I don't know that scientists often get higher achievements in ordinary experiments. This is what ordinary people cannot do. Ordinary people are indifferent to things, but scientists study to the end. Ordinary people understand a thing, and they consider it done. Scientists understand a thing, and they also use it carefully. For example, an ordinary experiment above, scientists have invented movies based on the "afterimage" effect of people's eyeballs. In this way, it is still the ancestor of movies!</p>
<p>We may have all seen movies. The movement of movies is agile. It can make many fixed human images on the film move. The reason for this is, as we said before, due to the continuous movement, the bird enters the cage. Gentlemen, please think about it. Of course, it will not be different: the movie can be regarded as the largest industry in the modern era. The amount of capital invested and the people who depend on it directly and indirectly make people speechless when they are counted. Not only that, the cultural dissemination effect of movies can also be said to be a unique weapon. It can make things come alive in front of you. It is much better than the teaching method of us sitting stiffly in the classroom and listening to the teacher's lectures. However, its origin is the thing that is not worth a smile mentioned above.</p>
<p>From this, we can also know that we should carefully experience and study the things we encounter in our daily life. Even a very small thing that is not worth looking at should be studied. Although we do not have to become scientists or inventors, it is not useless to study things and use things. I hope readers do not think my words are false.</p>
<h3 id="e96">I am a Refugee <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Refugee Reporter</p>
<p>People call me "refugee," and I myself admit that I am a "refugee."</p>
<p>"Refugee" is not a shameful term. It is only because my hometown has been destroyed by war that I have also sacrificed for the country and become a refugee. If my hometown is fortunately not in the war zone, but compatriots from other war zones flee to my hometown, then not only am I not a refugee, I may also be one of those who provide relief to refugees!</p>
<p>Even so, I cannot always rely on the relief of my compatriots. I must learn productive skills and study hard when I have the opportunity to receive an education. Because "refugee" is certainly not a shameful term, but it is shameful to be a "refugee" for the rest of my life!</p>

<h3 id="e97">Record of the JiaDing Three Massacres <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengfei</p>
<p>The Houhuang Bridge is stained with blood, recalling those years brings tears to my eyes,</p>
<p>How hateful that Ming Dynasty's Wu Sangui, invited the cruel enemy into our home, disrupting the peace,</p>
<p>Causing our great China to be without a pure land, the landscape changed color amidst the storm,</p>
<p>A generation of people suffered trampling, pitifully, their grievances cannot be redressed.</p>
<p>Only JiaDing city once resisted, willing to sacrifice blood and flesh,</p>
<p>Led by Huang Juyao, along with Hou Tongzeng,</p>
<p>Both were great loyal ministers of the Ming Dynasty,</p>
<p>These two gentlemen were inherently loyal and upright, unwilling to surrender to the Qing.</p>
<p>Recruiting brave men, gathering strong soldiers, everyone was willing to defend the isolated city,</p>
<p>Until the Qing soldiers arrived at the city, they went out of the city to resist with unparalleled courage.</p>
<p>Killing so many Qing soldiers that they cried out in pain, their blood flowed everywhere, their lives returned to the underworld.</p>
<p>At this time, the righteous people's reputation was strong, shouting to kill all the barbarians before stopping.</p>
<p>At that time, the Qing soldiers were defeated and retreated to call for help, and instantly swarmed in to besiege the city.</p>
<p>(Spoken) Sirs Hou and Huang, seeing the Qing soldiers returning, knew that they could not resist.</p>
<p>They ordered many strong men to close the city gates, and each guarded the city walls,</p>
<p>Prepared with rolling logs, stone catapults, short knives, bows and arrows, etc., waiting for them to attack the city.</p>
<p>They threw down ash bottles and catapult stones, or shot down random arrows.</p>
<p>If they climbed up the city, they only needed short knives to cut off their hands and feet, so many Tartars died again.</p>
<p>(Sung) At that time, the Tartars wanted to attack the city, but it was difficult to enter in a hurry.</p>
<p>The ash bottles and stone catapults above were like raindrops.</p>
<p>They wanted to use ropes to climb the city walls, but the ropes were cut off by knives.</p>
<p>So it was in vain to injure lives under the city, watching the city's firmness and inability to ascend.</p>
<p>The Tartars could only sigh at the city, saying that the JiaDing barbarians were stubborn.</p>
<p>Unlike other weaklings, who surrendered without resistance.</p>
<p>Therefore, they immediately dispatched a large army to block all four gates.</p>
<p>Besieged for such a long time, unexpectedly, an impact occurred after a month.</p>
<p>The grain in the city was exhausted, and it was difficult to maintain the will to defend the city.</p>
<p>So Hou and Huang had no choice but to resolutely express their feelings to the crowd,</p>
<p>Saying, "Everyone, we are all Han Chinese of the Ming Dynasty, a dignified people.</p>
<p>Now we are suffering the tragedy of losing our country and our homes, how can we be greedy for a day's life?</p>
<p>When the country is gone, the home is gone, a subjugated slave is lighter than a dog or pig.</p>
<p>You should know that in the past, the Yuan Dynasty called themselves emperors, oppressing the Central Plains was truly painful.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, ten households were supervised by three Tartars, and several families had to share a kitchen knife.</p>
<p>If it was the night of a wedding, the bride would first be given to the Tartars to have fun.</p>
<p>If it was a time for banquets and celebrations, the Tartars should be respected in the first seat.</p>
<p>Truly, all freedom was stripped away, and the shackles were like a prison.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are unwilling to surrender, and are willing to risk our lives today."</p>
<p>So everyone was brave and opened the city gate with a shout of killing.</p>
<p>Where the knives rose, the heads of the Tartars rolled to the ground, where the spears stabbed, the lives of the barbarians immediately returned to the underworld.</p>
<p>Everyone said, "Kill one to repay the debt, kill two to earn one."</p>
<p>"Resist to the end" was the slogan, even if the body dies, the spirit does not die.</p>
<p>At that time, a group of righteous people gave their lives, and suddenly the earth was dark and the sky was dim.</p>
<p>Huang Juyao and Hou Tongzeng, their righteousness reached the clouds, and they lost their lives.</p>
<p>It is lamentable that the city was lost, and an order was given to massacre the city.</p>
<p>The Tartars' hearts were so cruel and vicious, that they only felt satisfied after three massacres.</p>
<p>Who knows how many people were killed, the accumulated corpses stank everywhere.</p>
<p>The innocent people suffered, and it was heartbreaking to see.</p>
<p>Now, occasionally passing by the Houhuang Bridge, the green pines and cypresses are coldly solemn.</p>
<p>Truly, a generation of righteous people shines like the sun and moon, and their names remain in history forever.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Threshold of Reading Newspapers (I) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Tantian</p>
<p>The old man I know, if I don’t see him for two or three days, when I run into him, he always asks me, “Sir, what’s been happening in the newspaper these days?” So I usually talk to him about the news of the day in general terms and then leave. But when I think about it carefully, the old man knows quite a few characters, and his level of Chinese is really up to the level of a first-year junior high school student, but he often says that he can’t understand the newspaper, he doesn’t understand the threshold. Every time he meets me, he always asks me “What’s been happening in the newspaper?” His meaning seems to be that the newspaper is creating the news, rather than that the society is creating the news. The "Lugou Bridge Incident", the "August 13th Incident", and all the current war news, all happened in the newspaper, rather than actually unfolding around us. This is really a joke!</p>
<p>But there are countless people like him who work hard for a living every day and know a few words but can't understand the newspaper! Moreover, current affairs have a great impact on their lives. For example, why can’t he do business as before the war, and be unemployed? Why are some people moving from the front building to the attic? Why are ordinary people worried about the current high prices? All these current events are directly related to him, so he can't help but care about current events. And he always asks me, "What's been happening in the newspaper?" Alas, in this turbulent era, if people don't understand current affairs, not to mention being unemployed, even people who have jobs, it is very important, because the newspaper not only tells him the necessary social phenomena of the future, but also indicates the actual living conditions of the present. If a person wants to know how to make a living and the steps of being a person, then he must read the newspaper!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it is not easy for an ordinary person, even if his Chinese foundation is better, to really understand a newspaper. First, when you open a newspaper, your eyes are full of news, and the pages are seven or eight sheets long. Which news is important, is essential to read, which news is secondary, can be omitted. If you read it from beginning to end word for word, there is not so much time. How to start with the Twenty-Four Histories? Second, the layout and style of the news are novel, and the newspaper offices compete to be original. Often the beginning and end are separated, the length is uneven, it looks neither as clear as the Thousand Character Classic nor as easy to understand as Seven Heroes and Five Gallants, often the dragon sees its head but not its tail, making it inexplicable. Third, now science is advancing, culture is developing, and new terms are emerging one after another, some from physics, some from chemistry, and even more from political economy. These terms are naturally not understood by ordinary people. Fourth, the current newspapers, the sources of news, mostly have backgrounds, and are all government propaganda organs, not necessarily standing in the position of the common people to speak, to redress grievances for the common people, and to guide the common people to a way out, so the news published in the newspapers often differs greatly from the facts. Sometimes a major event occurs, and the news in each newspaper is also different. For example, take the "September 18th Incident". Chinese newspapers said that Japan invaded Chinese territory, wanted to destroy China, and dominate Asia. European and American newspapers said that the Japanese army wanted to hinder the interests of the great powers in China and would cause a second world war between the great powers, but Japanese newspapers said that they wanted to maintain peace in East Asia. This kind of statement is similar to Italy's invasion of Abyssinia. The newspapers said that Abyssinia was a barbaric country, and Italy had to civilize Abyssinia for the sake of promoting civilization. From this point of view, there are several ways of saying one thing. The public says the public is right, the wife says the wife is right, and the common people, when they see it, no wonder they don't understand the mystery.</p>
<p>I think, "To enable people like the old man to automatically read the newspaper, we must tell him the threshold of reading the newspaper, so that they first understand the threshold, and then various difficult problems will naturally be solved slowly. This is the best way: However, I myself am not very proficient in the threshold of reading newspapers on weekdays, especially what new terms, the political and economic relations of various countries... etc. I am ashamed to say that I myself do not understand many problems.

<h3 id="e100">Weekly War Report <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Hubei</p>
<p>The Japanese army in central Hubei, since capturing Zhongxiang last week, is now trying to continue its advance. In recent days, due to the fierce counterattack of the Chinese army, the Japanese army's offensive has become the end of its rope. The Chinese army is actively operating in Changshou Store, Yangzi Town, Shuilong River, and Xiantao Town, which have been successively recovered. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. In addition, the Chinese army once recovered Taipingchang, Chenjiayan, Renjiaji, Yanmenkou and other places, but due to the large number of Japanese troops and the use of gas, they temporarily withdrew. Now the Japanese army is confined to the east bank of the Xiang River, occasionally firing artillery towards the west bank, probably with the intention of holding on. Last week, the Japanese army once again advanced west of Yujia Store, but after being met by the Chinese army, it retreated. There is no action yet. The Chinese army in southern Hubei has repeatedly encountered the Japanese army, especially the battle at the junction of Yangxin and Daye was the fiercest.</p>
<p>Guangdong</p>
<p>The Japanese army in the southern suburbs of Guangdong has recently built fortifications to hold on. The Japanese army occupying Dagang Maoer Ridge was fiercely attacked by Chinese artillery, and the Japanese army seemed to have suffered losses. Afterwards, the Japanese army retreated, and the area was recovered. The Japanese army between Zengcheng and Conghua once advanced towards Taizikeng Zhengguo area to test the waters, while another part of the Japanese army harassed Xiagangling. The Chinese army had sufficient forces and resisted separately, and as a result, the Japanese army failed to succeed. The Chinese army in Huaxian suddenly launched an attack a few days ago, and joined forces with another part of the Chinese army to attack the Japanese army near Changgang. On the same day, Chinese planes flew to Xinjie Taipingchang and other places to bomb, and the Japanese troops in both places suffered losses. In addition, the Chinese army in Hainan Island once launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Longmen City, Ding'an County, and Dongxi Township, Qiongshan County. It is said that in this battle, the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses and was very angry. They burned and killed wantonly in the city, and the people were disturbed and extremely panicked.</p>
<p>Jiangsu</p>
<p>In Jiangsu Province, the Chinese and Japanese armies have fought fiercely in Huaiyin and Yingcheng since last week. After the strategic shift, the Chinese army actively counterattacked this week in coordination with the large army, and at the same time launched a large-scale guerrilla team to engage in guerrilla warfare. As a result of the fierce battle, Yingcheng has been recaptured by the Chinese army, and Huaiyin is also surrounded by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Yangzhou once invaded north of Zhaoguan Dam, attempting to threaten the rear of the Chinese army. After the Chinese army skillfully responded, it recaptured Zhaoguan, and the Chinese army is still in hot pursuit.</p>

<h3 id="e101">The Value of "Non-Recognitionism" <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Maolie</p>
<p>Abyssinia was annexed by Italy, and the Italian King was called the Emperor of Abyssinia. The British and French countries initially did not recognize it, but after several twists and turns, they all recognized it one after another. Mussolini's arrogance greatly increased, so he actively assisted Franco, resulting in the victory of the National Army. Sure enough, Britain and France also did not recognize the National Army government at first, but now they have recognized it.</p>
<p>Austria was annexed by Germany. In order to appease the people, Britain and France feared that recognition would be too slow. Hitler's arrogance also greatly increased, so he painstakingly planned and then acted. A few days ago, he again carried out the trick of annexing Bohemia and Moravia, and dividing Czechoslovakia. Britain and France are now playing the non-recognition game again. How long this game will last is still unknown, but it seems to be very short-lived.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the originator of "non-recognitionism" was Stimson of the United States. At that time, when our country's Northeast was invaded, Stimson had the intention of uniting with Britain to intervene, but Britain refused. Stimson then declared that he would not recognize the changes caused by force, thinking it was a remedy. This non-recognition is still valid!</p>
<p>Of course, with the non-recognition of various countries, at least aggressors can be sanctioned morally, so that aggressors have some scruples, fear, and dare not do whatever they want. This is the value of non-recognitionism. However, the same non-recognition, why does it fail for Abyssinia, Spain, Austria, or even Czechoslovakia, but it can still be effective for China? There is no other reason for this. First, the United States has the determination to maintain morality, and is not swayed by the reality of the violent. Before she has not changed her attitude towards China, other countries do not dare to take the risk of defying the world's justice, and arbitrarily recognize the evil forces of the aggressor; Second, and especially important, I think it is our persistent non-surrender, resisting to the end, which has provided a strong backing for this doctrine.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can say that "non-recognitionism" itself is valuable; But the existence of this value still requires countries that uphold justice to maintain it consistently, and the invaded country must work hard to be self-reliant, and not disappoint the good intentions of those who abide by this doctrine.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia is finished, and the declaration of non-recognition by Britain and France is just a kind of self-deprecation. Only China is still resisting. Non-recognitionism was originally initiated for the Chinese incident, but its value still needs China to maintain it. China has made this contribution to a legitimate doctrine in the international community, and China is also worthy of pride!</p>
<h3 id="e102">Writing and Personality <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— GaoGao</p>
<p>Qin Hui and Yan Song committed the crime of slandering loyal ministers and harming the country and the people. Even their pearl-like articles were sentenced to capital punishment and could not be "hidden in famous mountains and passed on to future generations." Zhou Zuoren, in Peiping, was suspected of being a traitor in his behavior. Many secondary schools in Shanghai removed his works from Chinese textbooks, although his personality has not yet reached the period of "assessment."</p>
<p>If the saying "a gentleman does not abandon words because of the person" is credible, I would feel sorry for the people of ancient and modern times. Judging articles by articles, the masterpieces of Qin Hui and Yan Song, "I cannot see them!" I have always held a "high mountain looking up" heart for Zhou Zuoren's articles. To this day, I still hope that he can prove his pure personality with strong facts!</p>
<p>Because of deviant behavior and vile personality, the article is implicated. The general public's view is that it is a kind of punishment, and his spiritual property is completely denied, causing him to suffer deeper pain, whether he is dead or alive. At the same time, it also implies the meaning of killing a chicken to show the monkey, so that scholars who can write do not dare to follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p>Actually, it is not so. Art cannot be separated from life, and works are entrusted to personality. Painting, sculpture, music, all are like this, and literature is especially obvious. It must exist in the heart before it can be expressed externally; it must have a heart that "cannot bear to see people suffer" before it can write the supreme article in the world. Han Yu said: "The so-called writing must have it in the heart. Therefore, a gentleman is cautious in reality. The beauty and ugliness of reality, its expression is not reckless." Tolstoy directly believed that art must be "for life," or even not limited to art. He said: "The prerequisite for all faithful professions is not the love of work, but the love of humanity that must be loved. Under the belief that this work improves humanity, work must be loved. Only those who fill their love with this can do valuable work." Just think, this kindness and harmony, this loyalty and enthusiasm are enough to illuminate the ages; and what about adding sharp eyes, trans-era insights, and artistic skills to express it in writing? Naturally, there is an incredible power. With this power, it arouses the resonance of mankind; with this power, it promotes the reform of politics, law, morality, and thought; with this power, it saves all living beings from deep water and scorching fire. Tolstoy is Tolstoy because of this, and similarly, Gorky is Gorky, Romain Rolland is Romain Rolland, Confucius is Confucius, Pitt is Pitt, Han Yu is Han Yu... also because of this. Then, know that establishing words must be based on establishing virtue, "hiding it in famous mountains and passing it on to future generations" is not something that can be achieved by luck.</p>
<p>What is most taboo in art is hypocritical expression. If you don't drink, you have to compose a few poems about drinking, wild drinking, and expressing your feelings after being drunk; if you are extremely enthusiastic, you have to play the high-profile tune of swearing alliances with seagulls and visiting fishermen and woodcutters; if your chest is full of selfish desires and evil thoughts, you have to say high-sounding words such as taking on righteousness and saving the people. "If you don't establish sincerity in rhetoric," where will there be good writing! Even if you "write as much as your height," it is just a temporary addition of many imitations, many rocks in the universe, not pearls and jade, and you will never be able to pass them on to future generations.</p>
<p>Even if his writing skills are very high, he can cover up the eyes of all people in the world; but his hypocritical life will always be exposed one day, especially in the "cold season." Once exposed, the "insincere" article, the "moment of expensive paper in Luoyang" has passed, and it is still not worth half a penny, for people to "cover the jar." No matter how similar the Yue Fei played on the stage is, he cannot be referred to as a national hero.</p>
<p>I deeply hope that young people who aspire to literature and art, in addition to devoting themselves to the cultivation of skills, will devote themselves to the cultivation of a great personality and a fulfilling life. Write the most sincere and emotional article with kindness, harmony, loyalty and enthusiasm, for yourself who is not in vain in this life, and for the Chinese nation who is resisting the war and building the country!</p>
<h3 id="e103">"Hu Dahai" <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Shusen</p>
<p>When it comes to "Hu Dahai," who doesn't know him within a hundred miles? Even the crazy yellow animals have to call him "Sir"!</p>
<p>Speaking of "Hu Dahai's" qualifications, he has also recited the Four Books and read the Five Classics; but he would interpret the words "national tax" as "the country is weakening, so it wants the people to donate money." He would also interpret the sentence "Yan Yuan died, and the Master cried bitterly" in the Analects as "After Yan Yuan died, Confucius cried so much that he wanted to drill a hole." There is no telling how many jokes he has made like this.</p>
<p>Originally, the name "Hu Dahai" was a nickname given to him by others; however, judging by the name, you can know what kind of form and personality he is. Perhaps the enemy thinks he is a bit silly, but somehow, he was appreciated by a general named Teng, who insisted on making him an official and gave him the title of Transportation Minister;—in fact, he was just using him as a handyman to guard the highway and the foreign bridge—and gave him a flag and an armband. The flag was also written with seven big characters: "Hu Dahai, Honorable Sir."</p>
<p>Usually, "Hu Dahai" seems to be there or not; however, after being promoted by General Teng, everyone unanimously said that "Hu Dahai" has officially become a traitor. But "Hu Dahai" does not argue with people.</p>
<p>Once, suddenly "Hu Dahai" happily walked into his home—Luoyang Village—with a fully armed enemy, scaring the people in the village to run around in a panic; especially the young women.</p>
<p>At that time, the people in the village were gnashing their teeth and cursing "Hu Dahai," why didn't he have fun on the street and lead people to the countryside to make trouble? Isn't this "inviting ghosts into the house"!</p>
<p>Hey! This time, "Hu Dahai" did something that no one could have imagined, which was better than eloquent facts: it was not "inviting ghosts into the house," it was clearly "closing the door to catch ghosts"!</p>
<p>It turned out that "Hu Dahai" had repeatedly seen the patrolling enemies slaughtering his compatriots and trampling on the women of his country, and he had long been unable to bear it; however, under the iron hoof, he had no chance to strike. This time, he was waiting for the opportunity: he tricked the most bastard of them into his own home, kindly serving him wine and food; he also called his own wife out to persuade him to drink, slowly getting the bastard drunk, and then seized the weapon that he used to kill people and killed him! This is called "using his own way to treat his own person."</p>
<p>Afterwards, every night, there were always enemies' companions shouting "Boss! Boss..." near Luoyang Village. This is probably the name of the enemy killed by "Hu Dahai," right?</p>
<p>From then on, the flag of "Hu Dahai, Honorable Sir" was never seen on the highway. At the same time, in the anti-Japanese base camp—the guerrilla team—there was one more person, "Hu Dahai."</p>

<p>— Su Ying</p>
<p>A moonless night.</p>
<p>Wangjia Village, shrouded in darkness, has no pedestrians on the fields.</p>
<p>Sparse gunshots were ringing in the distance. The dogs in Wangjia Village suddenly barked.</p>
<p>Wang Chunfa's door was ringing like a drum. Wang Chunfa opened the door, and he saw a tall man in short clothes standing outside the door, gasping for breath:</p>
<p>"Sorry, fellow villager! There are devils chasing from the front and back. I am alone, and one tree cannot make a forest. Let me stay for one night, and I will leave at dawn!"</p>
<p>"Um... you..." Wang Chunfa didn't quite understand where he came from.</p>
<p>"I am a New Fourth Army soldier. Tonight, I was ordered to go to Yinjiazhuang over there to suppress the devils. There were twelve of us, and there were more than fifty of them. It's terrible! Eleven of the twelve were lost, and I slipped here alone... Fellow villager! There are devils in front, too. Let me hide for a while, and I will leave at dawn!" He looked east, then west.</p>
<p>The distant gunshots were still ringing sparsely.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay!" Wang Chunfa let the tall man into the house, closed the door, bolted it, and propped it up.</p>
<p>The tall man asked for a towel to wipe his sweat. He groped in his bag and took out a short gun. The gun was empty. He looked at the gun and nodded with a smile:</p>
<p>"Damn it! A full gun of bullets, all eaten by the devils! Hahahaha..."</p>
<p>Wang Chunfa's door was ringing again, even tighter than the tall man had knocked.</p>
<p>Wang Chunfa led the tall man into the pit in the back. Above it was a stinky pigsty. Two fat pigs were not awakened by them and were still snoring soundly.</p>
<p>As soon as Wang Chunfa opened the door, four ferocious yellow-clothed men crowded inside.</p>
<p>They searched the living room, then the kitchen; they rummaged through the bedroom, and stirred up the pigsty, but they couldn't find the tall man. The two fat pigs were disturbed and ran around grunting. With a whistle, they left.</p>
<p>Wang Chunfa closed the door, bolted it, and propped it up.</p>
<p>There was no sound in Wang Chunfa's house, quiet, quiet, quiet until dawn.</p>
<p>The tall man stepped out of Wang Chunfa's door, shook hands with Wang Chunfa, and nodded.</p>

<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>"It's nothing else, we're just too tired. We want to find a girl to comfort us. It's also a way to 'befriend China'!"</p>
<p>Fang Hui took a step back and pointed the × army's box cannon with her finger, saying:</p>
<p>"You say 'befriend', but you point this murderous thing at me. Is this also a way to 'befriend'?"</p>
<p>The × army soldier smiled and was about to hand the box cannon to the person behind him, but Fang Hui quickly stopped him, saying:</p>
<p>"No! The weapon is in your hands. It's the same no matter who you give it to. I will never be fooled. Unless you give it to me, I will believe that you are sincerely 'befriending' us."</p>
<p>The × army soldier was quite hesitant at first, but later, relying on the two guns behind him, and because he was infatuated, he didn't bother to weigh the pros and cons. He actually confidently handed the box cannon to Fang Hui. Fang Hui took the box cannon, smiled, and waved to the × army soldier, saying: "Please come in!"</p>
<p>The × army soldier was overjoyed. The thatched cottage was clearly a city of the unjustly dead, but he mistook it for a comfortable nest. He stretched out his hands, intending to embrace Fang Hui. Fang Hui had already prepared, and gently flicked the mechanism of the box cannon. With a bang, the bullet hit the × army soldier's chest. The × army soldier didn't even have time to shout before he collapsed to the ground. The other two × army soldiers, seeing this change, hurriedly opened fire on Fang Hui. Although the flashlight had already gone out, Fang Hui's left arm was still hit by a bullet. Fortunately, the nurses in the rooms on both sides heard the gunshots and rushed out one after another. Thus, in a fierce fight, the other two × army soldiers were also killed. The small annihilation battle ended victoriously.</p>
<p>Fang Hui had the military doctor in charge dress the wound on her arm, and then, together with the nurses, called out to the villagers. The elderly, weak, women, and children had already heard the gunshots and refused to come out no matter what, until they knew there was no danger. Then, they all gathered tremblingly, and when they saw the bodies of the × army soldiers in front of the thatched cottage, they couldn't help but be surprised. Fang Hui briefly reported the process of killing the enemy just now to them, and said to them:</p>
<p>"If you are obedient subjects under the enemy's hands, you will always be on tenterhooks and will not get a moment's peace. Now that we have done this, the enemy may retaliate against you. I'm thinking for you. The only way is to follow us and join the guerrilla team led by Commander Ye, so that you can save your lives and avoid being harmed by the enemy."</p>
<p>The elderly, weak, women, and children were originally afraid that killing the × army soldiers would implicate them. When they heard Fang Hui say this, they all felt that her words were correct, so they went back to pack their clothes and valuables. Fang Hui also borrowed a pair of door panels from them, piled the bodies of the three × army soldiers on top of them, and, together with the captured spoils of war and the injured warriors who were being treated, were carried by stretcher-bearers and the people, heading north under the starry sky to find Commander Ye's team to rejoin.

<h3 id="e107">A Brief Account of Shanghai's Charitable Undertakings <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Huang Hanzhi</p>
<p>According to past history, there were no so-called charitable organizations. Supporting the elderly and caring for children, showing compassion to the lonely and widowed, and burying exposed bones were all matters included in political performance evaluations. Therefore, King Wen's benevolent governance necessarily started with widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless. In later generations, as political teachings gradually declined, members of society, based on their benevolent hearts, provided support and relief to supplement the inadequacies of politics. The so-called "eight hundred lonely and poor" and "ten thousand grand mansions" were purely acts of individual benevolence. Shanghai is a place where people from all directions gather, and the population is dense. In recent years, natural disasters and man-made calamities have been almost constant. In addition, the cost of living is rising daily, and unemployment is increasing. Therefore, charitable undertakings are also being expanded day by day.</p>
<p>During the 16th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Wang Yiting and Hanzhi et al. noted that there were many charitable organizations in the city, and the undertakings they ran were gradually expanding. It was appropriate to have a unified organization to gather wisdom, benefit from diverse perspectives, and unite efforts, so that there would be organized plans internally and substantial strength externally. Hence, the organization of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association was established. The undertakings run by each member of the Joint Association are listed below.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, there are still dozens or hundreds of charitable organizations run by various guilds, associations, and native place associations. The undertakings they run are nothing more than the above-mentioned items. When the August 13th Incident broke out, the addresses of most charitable organizations were in Nanshi and Zhabei, and most of their properties were in Kunshan, Jiading, Songjiang, and Qingpu counties. Some were destroyed by fire, and some were looted. The actual figures for the losses are almost impossible to investigate. Many undertakings were thus suspended. Even those within the concessions were significantly affected, with reduced income and financial difficulties, barely managing to maintain operations. According to a recent written survey by the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association, the current status of various charitable organizations is as follows.</p>
<p>Name　Current Undertaking　War Losses</p>
<p>Renji Shantang　All operations except schools are running as usual　No income from properties in occupied areas</p>
<p>Houren Tang　Assisting fellow villagers in distress　Most properties were destroyed, impossible to investigate</p>
<p>Weizhong Shantang　Suspended　Slight damage to the hall's foundation</p>
<p>Lianyi Shanhui　Providing coffins, providing medical care　Hall address and nursery were destroyed</p>
<p>Disabled Persons' Home　Sheltering the disabled　Foundation of the home and properties were severely damaged</p>
<p>Pushan Villa　Burial services, providing villages　Properties were almost completely destroyed</p>
<p>China Moral General Association　Barely maintaining original operations　Minor</p>
<p>Zhabei Charitable Association　Suspended　Part of the hall's foundation was destroyed</p>
<p>Zhisheng Shanyuan　Suspended　Properties were almost completely destroyed</p>
<p>Guangyi Shantang　Distributing clothing, providing medicine, providing relief to widows　Properties were severely damaged</p>
<p>China Relief Association for Women and Children　Barely maintaining original operations　Properties were almost completely destroyed</p>

<p>Xinwei Relief Association　Providing medicine　None</p>
<p>China Jisheng Association　Six regular charitable activities are barely maintained　Properties had already been completely destroyed during the January 28th Incident</p>
<p>Tongyi Shanhui　Suspended　Hall address was not destroyed, but internal losses were completely destroyed</p>
<p>Gongji Shantang　Suspended　Properties suffered significant losses</p>
<p>Fushan Tang　Suspended　Properties were severely damaged</p>
<p>Zhan Yi Chinese Medicine Hospital　Providing medical consultations and medicine　Properties were severely damaged</p>
<p>Guangye Gongyi Association　Providing coffins, providing medicine　Properties were severely damaged</p>
<p>Other charitable organizations have not yet submitted reports. In short, during this war, the properties of various charitable organizations were almost completely destroyed. It is extremely difficult to seek recovery. Currently, charitable undertakings are focused on providing relief to refugees. A brief account of the refugee relief situation of various relief organizations is as follows.</p>
<p>In the winter of the 25th year, due to the Suiyuan war, charitable organizations throughout the city jointly initiated the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, sending personnel to Suiyuan to distribute emergency relief. The following year, they took over the drought relief in Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. After the August 13th Incident, the Refugee Relief Committee of the War Zone was established, organizing a monk medical team to rescue wounded soldiers at the front. They established three refugee hospitals and contracted four hospitals, successively rescuing more than 10,000 wounded officers, soldiers, and civilians. They established more than 70 shelters, accommodating more than 200,000 refugees at the peak, and sending more than 50,000 refugees back home. The necessary expenses, in addition to government assistance, were purely dependent on donations from Chinese and foreign philanthropists and enthusiastic overseas Chinese. As of recently, the funds used have reached more than two million yuan. However, in this environment, Shanghai has become an isolated island, with industry and commerce in distress and finance tight. Donations have become exhausted, and the future is uncertain. Therefore, it is necessary to make drastic cuts. Those in charge can only do their best with the people's resources.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was also the Shanghai Branch of the Refugee Relief Association during the Extraordinary Period. After the fall of Shanghai, it was renamed the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association Refugee Relief Branch. Chinese and foreign philanthropists formed the Shanghai International Relief Committee. The Chinese Red Cross Society also established an international committee to assist various relief organizations in Shanghai. The committee ended at the end of October. People from all walks of life in China and abroad felt the need for an assistance mechanism of this nature, and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association was established to take over the tasks of the International Committee and assist various organizations directly accommodating refugees with food and supplies. The approximate number of refugees currently being accommodated by various organizations is as follows.</p>
<p>1.  The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association Refugee Relief Committee runs 30 shelters, 4 self-sufficient refugee centers, and 1 vagrant education center, totaling more than 33,300 people.</p>
<p>2.  The Refugee Relief Committee Branch of the War Zone runs 40 shelters, with a refugee population of more than 19,700 people.</p>
<p>3.  The Shanghai International Relief Committee runs 4 shelters, with a refugee population of more than 10,200 people.</p>
<p>4.  The Jiangning Native Place Association and others run 31 shelters, with a refugee population of more than 10,700 people.</p>
<p>5.  The Nanshi Refugee Area runs 113 shelters, with a refugee and poor population of more than 41,000 people.</p>
<p>The locations of the above shelters are mostly in the Nanshi Refugee Area. There are 73 shelters in the Public Concession, with more than 53,200 refugees. There are 8 shelters in the French Concession, with more than 15,800 refugees.</p>
<p>As for Tongren Fuyuan Hall and Pushan Villa, since the start of the Shanghai War, they have been entering and leaving the war zone at the risk of their lives to carry out general burial work. Their courageous spirit is especially commendable. The burial grounds are full, and it is difficult to find open spaces within the concessions. The difficulties are even greater. Recently, with the onset of winter, there are fewer deaths. Tongren Fuyuan Hall specializes in burial matters in Nanshi and the French Concession. Pushan Villa specializes in burial matters in the Public Concession, clearly delineating boundaries and working hard. This is also a deformed development.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Shanghai's Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>Shanghai's traditional Chinese medicine industry is quite interesting to discuss. There are 383 traditional Chinese medicine stores and 69 medicinal material stores. Western pharmacies coexist with the traditional Chinese medicine industry, but based on the number of prescriptions dispensed, it can be seen that the foundation of the traditional Chinese medicine industry is long-standing, and the business is flourishing, which is truly surprising and amazing. According to investigations, the daily number of prescriptions dispensed by traditional Chinese medicine stores is: the most is as high as 1,200 prescriptions, 300 prescriptions is the most common, and each store has at least 50 to 60 prescriptions. In total, Shanghai dispenses 70,000 traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions every day. Approximately 58 Chinese-owned Western pharmacies dispense prescriptions, with a total of 3,000 prescriptions dispensed daily. From the perspective of the number of prescriptions dispensed, the ratio is one to twenty-six.</p>
<p>The busiest time for traditional Chinese medicine stores is in the summer, and the most profitable time is in the winter. Recently, medicinal paste prescriptions have become popular. On the full moon day of last month, Hu Qingyu Hall's daily business income reached 24,035 yuan. Other traditional Chinese medicine stores have seen business increase by about 40% due to the concentration of population caused by the war. About 40 new stores have opened this year, and it seems difficult to find stores that will lose money by the end of the year. The usual annual business income reaches more than 9.6 million yuan, which cannot be said to be unsuccessful!</p>
<p>Most traditional Chinese medicine stores have a capital of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Tong Hanchun has the largest capital, reaching 1 million taels. Before the war, there were 3,475 employees. Treatment has greatly improved compared to ten years ago. There is a trade association, with my friends Gao Zhiwen, Song Fuchen, Qiu Yanling, Shen Hefu, and Shi Qintang as standing committee members.</p>
<p>Medicinal material stores are divided into firms and numbers: there are 61 medicinal material firms and 8 herbal medicine firms. There are also more than 90 firms from various guilds, divided into mountain goods, northern goods, Sichuan-Han goods, Guangdong goods, and western goods. 35 new stores have opened since the war, some of which were organized by people who were idle after the war, which shows that the business after the war is indeed quite prosperous. The medicinal material firms also formed the Medicinal Material Industry Trade Association, with a very sound organization. My friends Mao Zijian, Fei Tinghua, Dong Bowei, Xia Qizhen, and Chen Wenming are the leaders of the industry. Their command and planning have achieved remarkable results, the recent case being the collection of surcharges from refugees.</p>
<p>In addition to supplying traditional Chinese medicine stores in this and other cities, the medicinal material firms also declare and ship goods to countries around the world. There are no statistics on the annual declarations by medicinal material firms in Shanghai, but it is estimated to be at least more than 3 million yuan. The National Government's Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute recently compiled statistics, stating that the national export of traditional Chinese medicine reached 10 million yuan, which is a surprising gain in the war of resistance economy. Is traditional Chinese medicine useless? Can Chinese people who do not take traditional Chinese medicine not feel ashamed?</p>
<p>The efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine is in line with the physique of the Chinese people, so its business has never declined. The large number of people ordering medicinal paste prescriptions is truly unbelievable to outsiders. On the opening day of Beijing Hongrentang, 60 dan of donkey-hide gelatin were sold. The annual sales of donkey-hide gelatin from Feng Cunren and Cai Tongde are also huge. I believe that if the traditional Chinese medicine industry is improved and guided by new intellectuals to improve the medicines one by one, the results will be far greater than today.</p>
<p>The prepared medicine business of traditional Chinese medicine stores is far less than that of Western medicine. Only Lei Chongshang's Liushen Pills have annual sales of more than 420,000 yuan; Tong Hanchun's Zaizao Pills have annual sales of more than 220,000 yuan; Hu Qingyu's Biwen Pills have annual sales of 100,000 pills; and Tongchuntang's Baibu Paste also has huge sales. Other examples are not easy to point out. In fact, Chinese prepared medicines are very worthy of promotion. Recently, Xia Tieying established the Beijing Pharmacy, because Beijing is the champion of national prepared medicines, hence this specialized organization. Since its opening, the business has been extraordinarily prosperous. The reputation of Beijing medicines has always been good, and the future is very promising. Sanyou Industrial Cooperative has also been paying attention to traditional Chinese medicine in recent years. The daily sales of Zhifeng Pills are 300 boxes, which is not surprising; the daily sales of Fangbian Pills in Shanghai have reached 1,500 bottles, and daily sales in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia have reached 3,000 bottles. This is truly recovering a lot of profits. I believe that if Chinese prepared medicines are promoted using new marketing methods, it will be easier for the business to outperform ordinary Western medicines.</p>
<p>One more point: among the stories of various industries in Shanghai, the traditional Chinese medicine industry has the longest history and the most prosperous business. The Jiang Yanzhe and Yao Taishan stores were recorded in the Shanghai County Chronicles a hundred years ago. At that time, Shanghai was a barren land, and the traditional Chinese medicine business was already impressively visible! This is also a good story.</p>
<p>The most information for this article was provided by Mr. Sun Wenyi, a famous figure in the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Fei Yongzuo and Mr. Jiang Youcheng of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association also contributed. I express my gratitude in writing.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Chinese Team and the International Settlement Volunteer Corps <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Shihao</p>
<p>Thirty-three Years of Effort and the Growth of the Translation Team</p>
<p>A Brief History of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps: In the 95 years since Shanghai was opened as a port, the International Settlement Volunteer Corps has a long history of 85 years. Although its origins are ancient, its military equipment is quite modern. Although it has been subject to economic difficulties and austerity measures in recent years, it still includes more than 20 teams of different nationalities, including British, American, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, Filipino, and Jewish, and is still a force for emergency relief in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>The establishment of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps in Shanghai dates back to 1853. The motivation for its organization was the influence of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement. At that time, the concessions did not have the right to station troops for self-defense. Foreign merchants, aware of the booming power of the Hong Yang army and the precarious state of security within the concessions, gathered together with the consuls of various countries in Shanghai to jointly devise defensive measures. They decided to organize volunteer corps from various countries, recruit merchants living in Shanghai to enlist, and appoint Captain Tulangsun, an officer of the British Indian Army, as commander. At that time, American expatriates also formed their own team, commanded by Captain Kyle. This was the beginning of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps. After the Battle of Muddy Creek, it was disbanded for a time. In 1860, the Taiping Army launched a second uprising, and its power was restored. It was re-recruited, and two teams were formed, each with only 80 men. Two years later, under the guidance of Captain Bowlans, it was gradually expanded and began to take shape. In 1870, there were three infantry teams and one light cavalry team, with 200 members. Two mountain guns were transported from Hong Kong, and a field artillery team was established. In 1878, the entire corps was reorganized, the light cavalry team was withdrawn, and two infantry teams were reorganized. At that time, the commander was Mr. Doulitai, and his brother took over his position until Mr. Dou returned to his country in 1882. In 1883, when the entire corps held its first review, there were already 176 officers. Three years later, the artillery team was donated by the British government and obtained four artillery pieces. By 1895, the Portuguese team had joined, and the light cavalry team was also restored. In 1900, after the Boxer Rebellion, the entire corps underwent major changes. At that time, the commander was Major Gracock, and there were 350 members. Later, the Customs team, the American team, the Japanese team, and the armored car team were established and joined one after another, reaching 1,000 people, and the strength was greatly increased. At the same time, the Public Works Department also launched the organization of a machine gun team and purchased many light machine guns, which were distributed to various teams for application. Since then, it has gradually evolved and become more perfect! The powers of the Commander-in-Chief (Corps Commander) have also become more onerous. In the beginning, the corps commanders were all voluntary, but at this point, the Public Works Department requested the British military to send military officers to Shanghai to take charge of the matter, and set a term of three years. The first corps commander was Major Watson, who was succeeded by Captain McGinquan, in 1905, and in 1908 by Major Pence. In 1913, it was Major Whiteley. When the European War broke out, all the soldiers were called back to their countries to participate in the war, and there was no way to send them for a while, so the British military appointed the leader of the corps, Major Truman, as commander to be responsible for the corps affairs. After the war, the old system was restored. The succeeding corps commanders were Major General Manay Johnson in 1920, Colonel Gordon in 1925, Colonel Apun Pamou in 1928, Colonel Slimus in 1931, and Colonel Grehan in 1934. The current corps commander is Colonel Xiang Pei, who took office in 1937. Recently, the average number of people in the entire corps is more than 2,400. Except for about 400 Russian team members who are employed, the rest are volunteer members. The number of people in each team is more than 100, and the number of people in the smaller teams is 40 or 50. The authority to command the International Settlement Volunteer Corps belongs to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department. The Director-General of the Public Works Department has the responsibility of administrative head of the corps. The highest organization of the corps is the Corps Headquarters, which is divided into the Corps Headquarters Battalion, A Battalion, B Battalion, and C Battalion, and the infantry, cavalry, artillery, armored vehicle, and machine gun teams are all under its command. The order in which the teams joined the International Settlement Volunteer Corps and their names are listed below (in order of the date of formal approval).</p>

<p>Jewish Team July 1933</p>
<p>A Review of the Chinese Team: Since the opening of Shanghai as a port, there has been no status for Chinese people in international organizations. If there is, it should start with the Volunteer Corps. Because the national power was weak, foreigners discriminated against Chinese people. Therefore, Chinese people did not participate in the International Settlement Volunteer Corps at first. Until 1905, when the Great Trial of the Mixed Court case occurred, the local security was disturbed day and night. Therefore, Chinese business leaders Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Hengzhi, and Hu Jimei believed that the Volunteer Corps maintained local security and protected the lives and property of residents, which was an urgent matter at that time. They then invited more than 100 leaders from various industries to be directors, raised funds to organize, and set up various facilities. It was initially named the Chinese Businessmen's Gymnastics Association, and later renamed the Chinese Team Association. At that time, more than 500 team members were recruited, divided into a military band team, a cavalry team, and four infantry teams, etc., and military uniforms, guns, and equipment were purchased, and training grounds and gyms were established. This was the pioneer of the Chinese Volunteer Corps. Later, the establishment of the Chinese Team was originally closely related to the Chinese people living in the Concession, and since they lived in the Concession, they also had the duty to protect the merchants and people in the Concession. Therefore, they applied to the Public Works Department to join the International Settlement Volunteer Corps as the Chinese Team, and signed an agreement for 83 people to join the team at the Municipal Hall on Nanjing Road in 1907.</p>
<p>The Initial Hard Work: After the agreement was signed, the Corps Commander Watson presented to the Public Works Department to appoint Corbett, the former captain of the Customs Team, as the captain of the Chinese Team, and Grey Lie and Waterc as the deputy captains. Chinese people could only act as platoon leaders with the qualifications of team leaders. However, with the overall team members compromising and striving to improve, and always maintaining a pure combination, they made Chinese and foreign people shift their skeptical views and become enthusiastic admirers, and were treated equally with the teams of various countries. How could we have expected today's prosperity of the Chinese Team!</p>
<p>The Process of Struggle: After the Chinese Team was established, the first time it participated in the overall shooting competition was the "Nevis" trophy in 1909. It was an instant hit, and the results were excellent, which was praised by all sectors at home and abroad. After that, the team competed in the entire corps competition and external competitions, and they were always among the best. To mention the most prominent ones, they won the overall corps competence shield competition more than seven times. It is difficult to describe the victories won in international shooting competitions. It is well known that the Chinese Team's training and shooting are serious and the discipline is strict. All the members of the team can usually be resolute and hardworking, abide by the law and endure hardship. Once they are sent out for defense, they do not hesitate to work hard even in the hot summer and cold winter.</p>
<p>Records of Past Deployments: Since the establishment of the Chinese Team, it has participated in 11 overall corps deployments, including the recovery of Shanghai in 1911, the Second Revolution in 1912, the Third Revolution in 1914, the rickshaw wave and the peddlers' strike in the same year in 1918, the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919, the Jiang-Zhe-Qi-Lu War in 1924, the "May 30th" Massacre in 1925, the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1927, the "January 28th" Sino-Japanese War in 1932, and the recent "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War. In every riot, the Chinese Team was always the first to mobilize and the last to withdraw its defenses. During the deployment period, the tasks of the Chinese Team were no different from those of ordinary troops, either guarding and patrolling to prevent rioters, or providing translators to meet the great needs of emergency situations.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Translation Team: Since the two deployments of "January 28th" and "August 13th", the effectiveness of translators has become more and more obvious. Because the military, police, and Volunteer Corps of various countries gathered in one corner and were frequently mobilized, they were very obstructed by the local dialect. In order to avoid misunderstandings and benefit security, it was urgent to find local help. This is the origin of the Translation Team. In the past, this kind of translator was filled by members of the Chinese Team who were proficient in foreign languages. The organization that formed the group was roughly formed during the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident. At that time, many Chinese employees of various commercial firms who were proficient in Western languages volunteered to serve in the defense lines of various friendly troops and the Volunteer Corps, acting as interpreters for Chinese and foreign soldiers and civilians, eliminating barriers and harmonizing feelings, and achieved good results. However, at that time, it was temporary in nature. Later, Corps Commander Colonel Slimus deeply felt that this organization needed to be established permanently, so he submitted a request to the Public Works Department for approval, and it was officially established as a team of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps on October 1 of that year. The position of team leader was concurrently held by Chen Shixia, the captain of the Chinese Team, who started military training, and Wang Tingkui, Bao Xianqiang, and Zhang Nieyun were appointed as team officers to assist in everything. The team members' uniforms, guns, and training were the same as those of ordinary team members. In recent years, the number of competent team members has often reached 120, and although the team was established not long ago, it has already won the national competent silver shield in the previous session. During the "August 13th" battle last year, the work of the team was particularly valuable, and they were extremely hardworking in their birth and death risks.</p>
<p>Past Team Leaders and Recent Overview: After the establishment of the Chinese Team, in addition to the first two team leaders, the British Mr. Corbett and Mr. Grey Lie, the subsequent successors were Mr. Xu Tonghao (the current corps deputy, who once served as the commander-in-chief of the entire corps), Mr. Hu Yunqiu (the current Chinese affairs consultant of the corps headquarters), Mr. Hao Boyang, Mr. Zhang Tingrong, and Mr. Wang Yanqing. Those who have served as team officers are Mr. Tu Xiantai, Mr. Yang Wenqing, and Mr. Wang Zhiren (the current standing military officer); Chen Shixia, the current captain of the Chinese Team and the Translation Team, took over in the "January 28th" battle; the current team officers of the Chinese Team are Yu Xianen, Li Yushu, Zhou Qingen, and Zhang Tinggui; the team officers of the Translation Team are Wang Yankui, Xu Shaorong, Xia Ranyu, and Zhong Yuting, etc. In recent years, thanks to the effective leadership of the team officers and the efforts of the team members at all levels, the team's performance has become more and more successful, and the number of people has also increased sharply. Recently, there are no less than 600 regular, reserve, and reserve team members. Leading the entire corps and competing for international glory is really commendable. We look forward to the future, how can we limit it? Recently, I heard that the team is starting to recruit new team members for this year. Those with lofty aspirations are willing to return to it.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Job Registration and Talent Scouting <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Lin</p>
<p>The unemployment problem is really serious in Shanghai today. The high statistics have really broken previous records. According to reports, the China Section of the International Labour Office in Geneva has counted 300,000 workers alone. From these figures, we can infer that the overall unemployment figure in Shanghai must be quite high. Although Shanghai has a prosperous appearance at present, what about its internal affairs? The number of employees in the industrial, commercial, agricultural, and academic sectors has not only not increased, but is also decreasing, making it impossible for the general unemployed, especially those with poor knowledge and skills, to find a way out. At the same time, in recent years, thousands of Jews who have suffered unfortunate fates, Japanese who have come to China to "pan for gold," and unemployed White Russians, etc., have come one after another, making the problem of Shanghai's accommodation more and more difficult.</p>
<p>At a time when the tide of unemployment is so turbulent, registering for a job at an employment agency certainly cannot guarantee success, but perhaps there is some hope.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute, affiliated to the Chinese Vocational Education Society, is highly respected by society because of its considerable history and reputation. The work it undertakes to introduce jobs and scout for talents is highly regarded by society. Just step into the door and see the situation in that office where so many unemployed people who are requesting registration gather, and you can know the large number of unemployed people and the arduous work of the institute. Especially in recent years, it has to accept dozens or one or two hundred people for registration and interviews in a few hours of work every day. (No fees are charged)</p>
<p>The first step in registering with the institute is to fill out a job application form. In addition to filling in one's resume in detail, one must also fill in one's expertise, past experience, and spiritual and material hopes in detail, and then fill in the interview registration form and wait for registration and interview in turn.</p>
<p>After the interview, the registrar's appearance, attitude, speech, demeanor, obvious personality, physical characteristics, etc. are recorded one by one, and then this is used as a standard to introduce jobs by chance. However, the number of people who are registered every day who are successfully introduced to jobs is quite low - the reasons for this are naturally multifaceted.</p>
<p>Although there are so many unemployed people in real society, the lack of talent in various departments is quite serious. Many institutions and manufacturers ask the institute to scout for talent on their behalf, but the scope they need is mostly technical talent, such as: engineers, technicians of industrial plants, manufacturing technicians of chemical products, teachers of handicrafts, teachers of specialized subjects in schools, and skilled workers.</p>
<p>After receiving a request, if the registrants do not have such talent, the institute will publicly solicit it in the newspaper. As long as you pay a little attention to the readers of short messages in the local news of major newspapers, you can probably always see it. It is said that various specialized talents are publicly solicited, but they are still not available. It can be seen that there are too few people with knowledge and skills in society. On the contrary, there are too many mediocre people. If we combine the two difficult focal points of any department in real society hoping to obtain sufficient talent and the general mediocre people hoping to obtain good jobs, it is really impossible, except for the popularization of education and the improvement of the economic burden capacity of the general public in studying.</p>
<p>However, we always hope that the general public will learn as much knowledge and skills as possible, and temper their physique. Don't wander around all day because you have no money and no job, and "wait" for a job.</p>
<h3 id="e111">"Old But Vigorous" <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Ren</p>
<p>"Respecting the elderly" is a virtue, but respect is only "respect"; it does not mean "praising." But in China, traditionally, "old" is called "longevity." Grand events such as "Centennial Celebrations" are "praised" to the utmost. In fact, human premature death and longevity are very natural phenomena. At most, it makes me learn a little "health care," such as what pharmacies often use the "health care techniques" of "old people" as promotional advertisements.</p>
<p>Yesterday was Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Centennial Celebration, and the Fudan University Alumni Association held a celebration meeting at the New Asia Hotel. "Celebration" naturally also has the meaning of "praising," so is it superfluous? This is exactly the opposite. Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Centennial Celebration should be "praised" and is worth "praising" because what we "praise is not Mr. Ma Xiangbo's centennial," but "praise" Mr. Ma Xiangbo's "spirit."</p>
<p>Although he wrote in a letter to the Fudan University Alumni Association: "Since the war broke out, the country has no peace, the people have no livelihood, and they are displaced in foreign lands. I am ashamed of my lack of virtue and ability, and I always hate longevity and humiliation. I am deeply grateful for your celebration and wishes, and I feel embarrassed." But why did Mr. Ma Xiangbo "displaced in foreign lands"? He is only working hard and running around for the "people" who have "no livelihood" and the "country" that has "no peace." This kind of "spirit" should be and is worth our "praising"! On the contrary, even if you are young and handsome, with a graceful appearance, you are a "decrepit" in "spirit"!</p>
<p>Therefore, "old but vigorous" does not mean that the body is as strong as ever, but that the spirit is as energetic as in youth. On the occasion of Mr. Ma Xiangbo's centennial birthday, I would like to extend my congratulations with these four words, and at the same time encourage myself. We, the young generation, should work harder and make progress!</p>
<h3 id="e112">After the Rain, the Sky Clears <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Praising the Longevity of a Person, One Seed Sprouts Three Excellent Talents; Narrating Friendship, Two Scholars Meet Heroes</p>
<p>At this time, He Liyu was very happy and said, "Then the three children are still with you? I must go and see them! I remember when we were in America, it was because of the five girls born in one birth in Morse Town, Canada, that caused a sensation around the world. Not only were visitors flooding through the door, but they also made a fortune in the film industry. There were always several films a year that used these five little sisters to attract audiences. In addition to making films, they were also used for advertising. All kinds of children's medicines and cosmetics used these five little sisters as trademarks. Although we only have two sons in one birth, people have two and a half pairs, and we only have one and a half pairs, which is still one pair short. But I also feel that it is rare. In ancient times, it would be considered a person of longevity." Zhu Ai smiled and said, "If you want to see them, we not only don't refuse, but we also welcome you very much. We take photos of these three little brothers almost every month. We take photos of them from the beginning of their birth at seven days old until now, and we have taken more than ten photos in total. Every time we take a photo, we always remember how many months and days they are. There is a photo album, and their photos are pasted in order. We want to see the process of their development. We will take photos of them again soon, and we also hope that you two and the three of them will take a photo together, which is very meaningful. If you want to see them, you can take you to see them tomorrow, but you can't see them for free, you have to pay a meeting fee!" In the middle of speaking, they were gradually approaching the village where Zhu Ai's hospital was located. It turned out that this town was originally called Anle Town. When the hospital for women and children was first built there, there were not many families in the town, only dozens of families. The hospital was also small in scale, only a church with an attached hospital. Later, through the hard work of that Tong Shengshi, she was a faithful believer who remained chaste and unmarried, and was enthusiastic about saving the world, and many people were moved by her. Her hospital became more and more developed day by day, and the local area became more and more lively day by day. Now the area has also expanded. Counting the gold towns around, there are a total of seven or eight hundred families. Not only that, but there are also several small factories in the town. The neighboring villages and towns are all sericulture farmers. In addition to private sericulture, there are also several collective sericulture places in the town. In addition, there are several weaving factories among the small factories. These sericulture farms and weaving factories are mostly female workers, and they are also most closely related to the women and children's hospital. As for other things such as small schools and libraries, they should have everything. Various facilities such as electric lights and electricity are almost as popular as more prosperous towns.

<h3 id="e113">"Sensations of Going Places" <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>Produced by Warner Bros. Shown at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>It seems that there are too many plays like "Going Places" in Hollywood. I think I should still let the diners reminisce about this kind of play you have seen, - horse racing, music, singing, the so-called "sexy and funny movie", by saying ""The story is like this"".</p>
<p>The "story of" "Going Places" is:</p>
<p>"Young Peter is a clerk of a sports goods company. He is ordered by the owner of the company to impersonate the famous Australian jockey Peter Rendall and carry a large number of sports goods to Marynan for promotion, because the horse racing meeting will be held there soon." As a result, this "impersonating famous jockey" met Colonel Whitling and his wife, who liked to watch horse races, and also met Colonel's son Jack and niece Ellen, a pair of young people who liked to keep horses.</p>
<p>What is even more coincidental is that Jack's beloved horse is named "Gibbs Creebs", who is startled, wild, and unruly, and no one dares to control it; the groom Gabby is good at knowing the horse's intentions, and whenever the horse's wildness breaks out, he always blows a trumpet and plays its special song, and the horse bows its head and obeys, and is unusually docile. And what about that Miss Ellen? Her famous horse "Ellen Girl" is a horse that "has participated in competitions many times and has never won a prize." Now that she sees that Peter's horsemanship is exquisite, she earnestly asks him to help her win the championship.</p>
<p>How is Peter's "exquisite horsemanship" seen? It is: "Gibbs Creebs" was startled and ran out of the stable, and Peter happened to fall on the horse's back: Later, it was thanks to "Gabby who rode a motorcycle and chased after him, and the horse stopped immediately when he heard the music," and the siege was solved.</p>
<p>But it is coincidental that "Ellen Girl" was stolen before the competition, so this "impersonating famous jockey" rode "Gibbs Creebs" to participate in the competition.</p>
<p>This competition also follows the usual practice of Hollywood's "sexy and funny movies." Of course, it must "win the championship," and the hero and heroine meet and End.</p>
<p>"Going Places" is also like this, not an exception at all. As for the way to win, it is "Gabby led a band according to plan and drove a car along the track and played the most favorite songs." However, this time it was not "the horse immediately stopped when it heard the music," this time it was "leading all the way," which was as satisfactory and smooth as the author imagined.</p>
<p>This story is familiar to you: "I seem to have seen it in some movie"? That's what you think, isn't it?</p>
<p>Naturally, your memory is not correct, because "Going Places" is the first time it has been shown in Shanghai; however, it cannot be said that you are wrong, because this kind of film is originally "almost the same."</p>
<p>Then is "Going Places" funny or not? The respectful answer is: I will give you an example, you see if it is funny or not: The groom is good at knowing the horse's intentions, and his trumpet can make the startled horse advance and retreat as he wishes, as the author imagines, he can "stop immediately" with it, and he can also "lead all the way." Do you think this is funny or not?</p>
<p>As for Dick Powell's Peter, he just stood silently on the horse's back, and other than that, he just sang a song with Annie Taylor Louise and others. That song may be used by the band in the dance hall, because there are already many such songs in the dance hall. Isn't it better and more fresh to have one more song?</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Life of a Female Office Worker (Continued) <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Tsunami</p>
<p>Therefore, to apply for a female office worker position, one must have a standard "marketable appearance." Otherwise, even if you speak perfect "Yes, All-right" like a foreigner, it would still be difficult to pass the examination.</p>
<p>Although there are no strict regulations regarding qualifications for application, one must at least have an education level of having attended or graduated from middle school. Great importance is placed on conversational English, as well as proficiency in various domestic dialects. For example, Cantonese and Northern Mandarin are highly welcomed by the bosses. Next in importance is proficiency in abacus calculation, which is also a key part of the examination. As for Chinese language proficiency, it seems to be of the least importance. As long as you can write simple memos, you don't have to worry about failing the exam.</p>
<p>Speaking of female office workers' salaries, there's a great disparity even for the same position. Monthly pay ranges from seven or eight yuan to a maximum of twenty-plus yuan. How could that little money be enough? Just their expenses on makeup are quite considerable! Therefore, many female office workers need their families, like their fathers and brothers, to supplement their income, in addition to what they earn themselves. Clearly, a female office worker's fashionable attire is a case of "a poor man putting on airs," simply maintaining appearances!</p>
<p>Now let me talk about the extracurricular life of female office workers. A person's life is easily influenced by the surrounding environment. Those who can control the environment are the most rational and the most resolute. Often, innocent and pure girls, fresh out of school, enter these extravagant and decadent environments, and their eyes and ears are influenced, leading to transformation. Those who didn't perm their hair before start to perm it like everyone else. Those who used to find people wearing high heels strange and repulsive now wear them as a matter of course. Those who used to care about national affairs now find even reading a newspaper uninteresting. Generally speaking, female office workers are considered intellectuals, but in reality, out of a hundred female office workers, perhaps only ten or so read the newspaper every day. This is not the author intentionally exaggerating to sensationalize but rather facts seen and heard! Perhaps some alert female office workers share the same sentiments.</p>
<p>Speaking of their general leisure activities, under the guidance of some male colleagues, many frequently go to cinemas and theaters. Naturally, their main purpose is to use the cinema to live a life of "pseudo-romance." However, most female office workers spend their leisure time at home, helping their parents with trivial household chores or leading a muddled and unconscious private family life.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot deny that a small number of female office workers have awakened amidst the sound of the Anti-Japanese War. They are participating in various direct and indirect anti-Japanese efforts. In the midst of a luxurious environment, they strengthen their resolve and actively carry out the sacred task of awakening and organizing their generally unfocused female colleagues, which is the fundamental work for the women's liberation movement. These dedicated and hardworking female warriors are worthy of our praise. (The End)</p>
