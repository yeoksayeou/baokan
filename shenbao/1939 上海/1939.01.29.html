<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c13">上海青年往那兒走？ <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>目前上海這一處地方，至少聚居着幾十萬乃至近百萬的靑年，其中包括着一向生長在上海的土著靑年，和八一三以後從各戰區以至各游擊區流亡來滬的靑年。上海靑年本來是全國的優秀分子；就是那從各地流亡來滬的靑年，事實上也是經濟能力和教育程度都在水平綫以上的。這樣巨大數量和優秀品質的靑年，如果分佈到內地去，無疑地都是抗戰陣營中最活躍的分子。在前綫，在後方，在戰壕中，在醫院裏，以至在一切的工作部門裏，到處會表現着他們或她們的力量。如今呢，環境使這許多靑年蟄居在孤島上，環境把上海靑年一顆顆活躍的心，跟適合於它們活躍的區域隔離開來；同時，目前的上海，敎育設施以及文化事業，內容上都顯示着異常的萎縮，絕不能使靑年人感到滿足。因此，當今的上海青年年界裏就流行着一種苦悶的精神現象，在學校的作文卷裏，在靑年人的信札裏，在報紙的讀者園地裏，處處流露着靑年的悲憤。他們或她們並不哀訴經濟的困窮，也不表示失戀的苦痛，祗是申述那無從表現救國工作的一種精神出路上的煩悶。在民族國家的立塲上說起來，這固然是靑年思想進步的好現象；可是同時也可以說是全國人力總動員上一種供求不相應的矛盾事實。</p>
<p>怎樣尋求上海青年的出路，可說是今日孤島社會上値得討論的一個重問題。過去報紙和其他刋物對於這個問題討論得很熱鬧，歸納起來不外兩種主張：第一種主張鼓勵青年到內地去做救亡工作，因為孤島上停潴著這許多活力，不如疏散到有用的地方去，使它們各得其所；第二種主張，以為上海這地方並不至於無事可做，靑年們也不一定要去參與許多直接的工作，不如守着自己的崗位，作本位上的努力。這兩種說法原是各有理由同時也各有流弊的，因為少數犯着幼稚病的或是抱着苟安思想的人都可以分別把那種美妙的話來辯護他的行動；同時各人所走的正確路綫，往往必須聽受本身環境的决定，所以儘管連篇累牘地討論着，孤島上靑年的出路依然還是一個重大的問題。</p>
<p>自從抗戰轉入新階段以後，中國民族抗戰的陣營又需要充實起來，所以上海靑年的出路問題，應該有一個合理的解决，至少上海靑年們自己應該有一番明確的認識。每一個靑年應把自身的環境仔細分析一下，同時也把自己的能力和個性仔細地分析一下。如果環境和能力都允許某一個靑年離開上海的話，這一位靑年不妨離開上海，因為這樣對於抗戰前途可以發揮一份更多的效率。離開了上海到那裏去呢？以事實而論，目前到內地去，還不如到上海四周的游擊區裏去，工作的效率更高一點。因為抗戰的第二期是游擊戰最重要的時期，在游擊區裏，如軍隊政治工作的執行，民衆不合作運動的開展，處處都需要靑年人去參加；而孤島靑年去參加近處游擊區裏的這種工作，非但路途較近，而且一切人情風俗也更容易嘹解，可以說是一件十分適合的事。如果環境不容許某一個靑年離開上海，他就祗能留居下去，可是所謂「崗位」，所謂「本位努力」，應該以確切不離抗戰的陣綫為標準。否則便有「苟安」的嫌疑。怎樣算是不離開抗戰陣綫？最要緊的是每一個靑年應參加一種救國運動的組織。上海不是沒有救國工作可做，但是一個個人的單體救國實在是不可能的，只有組織才能發生行動，才能發生有效率的行動。今日上海孤島四百萬人，人人都熱烈地擁護抗戰建國，只是缺乏一種組織來做一種堅強的維繫，這四百萬人的大組織，應該由幾十萬人的靑年組織來做起點，做核心。</p>

<p>李維諾夫之節略與備忘錄、當指出日使文中自相矛盾之點、及日方要求之毫無根據、並堅决聲明「日本漁業主歷來均特別希望拍賣日期事先公佈、俾彼等得以適當準備漁季工作、漁業談判之繼續、並不能限制蘇政府行動自由、緣蘇政府早以切實聲明新協定必須以漁塲拍賣為根據、在蘇聯海岸附近、蘇聯領海內並屬於蘇聯之漁塲進行拍賣、祇有蘇政府可以單方面行動出之、因其為蘇聯政府之主權、期限已經過去之公的與協定、吾人自不應加以引用如日大使所為、至樸資茅斯和約則雖其根本部份的精神及字義、均無疑巳經日本違犯、其中亦絕無與拍賣原則衝突之處、該條的亦未規定日本可以任意索取蘇屬之任何漁塲以及任何塲數、該條的生效後、日方會有多年僅得經營漁塲百餘處、而現在彼等則司以經過拍賣租用三百餘處、至謂日人曾經租用之漁塲、即永遠應屬日人、不僅能以他漁塲交換、則實屬毫無理由、</p>
<p>日大使所謂蘇政府拍買之舉合法與吾之說全係武斷、絕無蘇方承諾之任何義務為根據及理由、日方必須認識此項漁塲、乃蘇聯國家產業、應由蘇政府處理、日方僅能根據與蘇政府之協定使用、其地位亦僅為承租人、近年來之局勢由山雙方同意行使之辦法既已過去、蘇聯政府自不負任何義務、此辦法之繼續或修改、僅能視蘇政府之善意决定、同時對於所謂「日本人民之歷史情緒」、蘇政府亦無義務可言、即使所謂此種情緒因漁塲數目减少而受嚴重打擊之說可以成立、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府絕無企圖變漁業問題為政治問題之意、但此非謂蘇方即須不問日政府對蘇聯之政策及日政府官方代表關於該政策目的之公開宣言、並不應採取必要手段、以防禦國境及海岸、對於國防之注意、當然不能從任何公的或協定、引伸而為蘇政府之天然的、無可爭執的、及無可侵犯的權利、蘇政府認定一切非從本身正式義務發生、而係武斷提出的要求、均不能容忍、就日政府對蘇聯之政策言之、日方實無任何政治的道德的理由、向蘇聯政府提出、超出後者正式義務以外之要求、日方既經給與經過拒賣租用漁塲之可能、則樸茨茅斯和的之義務已經完全履行、日方漁人如參加拍賣、即可保證彼等之利益得到充分限度以外之滿足、而彼等如不參加拍賣、則此種利益即將受損、並將發生一切後果、</p>
<p>至於日大使辭中暗含而日方報紙則比較公然宜言之恐嚇伎倆、一般地實毫無價值、對於日方漁業主既無任何利益、亦絕不能影響蘇聯政府完全公正的態度、（廿八日塔斯電）</p>

<p>— 黃雨齋</p>
<p>匯劃貼現之裹扣外挖</p>
<p>一，前言</p>
<p>吾國票據法之頒行，乃最近十年間事，吾人以因襲於習慣成見，對票據一事，率多認識未淸，或竟因此而發生懷疑與不信任者；是故商業塲中，票據之應用，仍未能普遍，實則交易由物物進為信用媒介由貨帛而錢幣而紙幣，既為進化之正規，則票據乃紙幣信用擴展之產物，以代紙幣為交易之媒介，自屬理所當然，彼泰西各國，幾視票據為交易上必要之工具，良以錢幣有時而竭，票據則可運用自如，輔以貼現事業之發達，週轉藉以靈通，繁榮工商，實利賴之，吾國工商落後，幣制紊亂，政府諸公，决心籌謀復興，乃有民二十四年十一月四日幣制大改革之實施，迄今三載，成効卓著。無如票據之應用，終以泥於習俗，猶未見普遍，自滬戰爆發，政府既揭開全面抗戰之局勢，動員經濟，自屬當務之急，於是財部乃有非常時期安定金融辦法之公布，實行限制提存。本埠銀錢業，更遵照該項辦法，另擬補充辦法，呈部核准，在提存限制以外者，得以同業匯劃支付之，並限在商業支付上相互匯劃，於是上海市塲，有隔日取現之匯劃票據。成為不取現之匯劃票據，工商界桎於環境，亦不得不以匯劃為交易籌碼。票據運用既廣，金融界亦連帶產生若干特殊現象，茲逢元旦，本報有經濟特刊之出索文於余，愛就本題，路一申淪之。</p>
<p>二，匯劃貼水與投機操縱</p>
<p>匯劃票據既為戰時金融措置上本埠之特殊產物，在推行之始，容有相當不便，幸賴我工商各界，上體政府苦心，一致維護，戰後本埠金融之仍能安如磐石，穩健異常者，良非無因；而匯劃票據之於戰時金融，厥功非淺，亦昭然若揭矣。惟因各界資金運用上現鈔之需要，不得不以貼現手段，向銀錢業換取現鈔，於是市上專營匯劃貼現業之新機關，乃如雨後春筍，應運而生，惟是此項貼現，行業上所謂貼現，名同而實異。按普通銀行學上之所謂貼現，一般解釋為銀行對於定期支付之票據或證券，照一定利率，算出付款日期到達間之利息，由票據或證券所載金額內减去之，以其所餘之價，收買其票據或證券之業務。而匯劃票據之貼現，則為銀行對於非常期間不能兌現之匯劃票據，照一定貼現率，算出應付貼水，由票據所載金額內减去之，以其所餘之價，收買其票據之業務，此項新業務，初既無前例或成規可援，又少管理統制之組織，於是投機者流，不免從中操縱，藉牟漁利；而同業則又互相競爭，各守秘密，行市既不統一，消息亦欠靈通，爾虞我詐，不一而足，以致買賣兩造，咸蒙損害。</p>
<p>按一年內匯劃貼現率，漲落殊不一定，在去年年底，最初有高至每千四十以上者，嗣後形勢稍緩，降落至每千二十左右，迄乎今歲春夏以來，貼水陡漲，徐州陷落時，竟一度漲至每千七十八元之最高峯，幸不久卽稍回，盤旋於每千五六十元之間，漢口廣州相繼失守時，貼水漲風又在，達每千七十一二元之譜，在行市混亂之際，投機者固可操縱牟利，工商界則需要現鈔，貼現無所適從，暗中吃虧不少，最近中美中英鉅額貸款，已見成功，同時戰局前途，又入另一新階段，人民心理安定，金融基礎鞏固，此項貼現率乃急轉直下，曾一度降至千分之三十七左右，刻盤旋於四十二三之間，實為一大好現象。（未完）</p>

<p>桂省人民自衡力量極為雄厚　汪精衛於元旦出現河內市上</p>
<p>「本報專訪」　近來西南各省建設之孟晋，交通之發達，一日千里，本報記者昨唔甫自桂林歸來之某氏，據其所述沿途觀感，至為詳盡，茲錄其大耍如次：</p>
<p>由桂林啟程時，桂林雖迭遭日機轟炸，而該地情况則仍極安靜，第一夕宿於柳州，柳州地方，民風簡樸而耐勞，村居大多茅屋，而生產力極高，次日由柳州至南寗，該處為前廣西省會，較為繁盛，民間亦均用瓦屋，靑山綠水，依稀江南量物。旅館均以桂幣計，桂幣折合法幣為對折，故三四元之房間，的法幣二元足矣。翌日，由南寗至龍州，該處設有督辦公暑，辦理出國護照簽發事宜；凡由內地道經安南者，均須辦理此項手續，覓當地鋪保證明，方可簽發。在龍州附近有鴨子灘，為全省公路最險峻之處，其公路環繞山巔，在公路下瞰，則為鴨子灘，水深千尺，偶一不愼，輒遭墮軍。氏經此處，尚見有覆車三四輛，蓋因往來既繁，不免肇事耳。</p>
<p>由龍州經鎭南關，仍搭汽車，鎮南關於劉永福中法之役，著有光榮之歷史。該關形勢，頗形險要，惟其形式較居庸關為小。出鎭南關即入安南境，該處普通語為安南土認與法語，鄉村情形，則猶如中國內地。是夜，宿於同登，由同登至河內，則有鐵路可通，朝發夕至。再由河內至海防，鐵路暢達，在海防候輸，有直航上海者，有止於香港者，均極便利。氏並謂此行所經各地，均有中國旅行社分社，於旅客之助力不少。氏深覺如此長途，中經各處，輒勾留數日，考察地方民情風俗教育建設等等事宜，而所費並不鉅，對於中國內地一般情况，認為人力物力，綽有餘裕，西南為中國之實藏，洵不誣也。</p>
<p>桂省公路交通，大致已開　就緒，全省各處，幾均可以汽車直達。人民之自衛力量，至為雄厚；因該省行政設施之多年改進，農產頗為豐富。自湘桂鐵路完成，該省與內地交通，巳甚便捷，最近又展築鎮南段鐵路，係由南寗至鎭南關，現巳漸决工竣，即可通車，將來即與越南鐵道貫通。此種建設進展之神速，國人聞之，亦必為之快慰，將來河內桂林間當與河內昆明間，同為中國西南兩大要道。</p>
<p>汪精衛之突離重慶而赴安南，氏於途中會詳知之，據云：汪初離重慶抵越境時，並無護照，故頗感為難，嗣在諒山下榻多日，國歷新年元旦，在及隨從出現於河內市上，然亦深自戒備。據氏所聞，外傳汪氏寓於距河內數十里鄉村之說，殆係其左右故意之傳述，以避人耳目者。河內之環境風景，確甚淸朗有致。該處近因客貨運之擁擠，交通甚繁，當氏由海防搭輪過廣州灣北海時，日機幾日往投彈，氏會在西營登岸，轉往赤坎一帶參觀，該處亦商賈薈萃，備極熱鬧。</p>

<p>中國國營上海招商局、當前年「八一三」滬戰發生後、即將全部產權、讓渡與美商衛利韓公司經營、第一步接收法租界金利源碼頭、現改為羅斯福碼頭、恢複業務、戰後浦江上下游中外商各棧碼頭、因情勢關係、大部並未復業、故羅斯福碼頭業務相當發達、惟招商滬局、除金利源棧之外、尚有浦東楊家渡之新棧。其昌棧之華棧·虹口之中棧·北棧。四處、因在戰區、戰時未會接收、戰後為日軍所佔、迄未交還、</p>
<p>日方未允交還</p>
<p>衛利韓公司當局、以收買招商滬局、係興中國國民政府交通部經過合法手續、並經美國領事法庭裁判確定、取得合法產權、故迭經請求該國外交當局、依法向日方交涉、但被藉口軍事關係、始終未允讓出、本月初、日軍忽將所佔沛柬新棧·華棧·二處遷讓、且傳美日間交涉有解决之望、不謂此舉日方別有企圖、直至最近、始判明眞相、係圖將兩棧交與日商日淸公司營業、</p>
<p>日清接管兩棧</p>
<p>日清公司方面、昨日突派職員二十四名、分派於楊家　棧與共昌棧華棧兩處、將棧屋同時接管、駐棧看守、並聞短期內整理後、擬恢復兩棧業務、據內部傳出消息、日方表面上雖為交與日淸公司暫管性質、但日消公司係屬純粹商業組織、顯有侵佔別國商業之嫌、且聞虹口中棧·北棧·兩處、不久亦將交日淸公司佔用、惟衛利韓公司對此已吾提出交涉、尚無所聞、此後糾葛、頗足引起中外注意、</p>

<p>前傳邵力子係諧音之誤　西報載與運輸事有關係</p>
<p>愛文義路日前發生綁案之訊、因捕房當時未據有佐證之報告、故一時無從證明、而西報紀載、則謂謠傳被綁者為邵力子、但亦尚無法確定其人為誰云云、嗣華字報紙則據重慶電、謂邵氏現安居重慶、已足證明邵氏被綁之說、全係謠傳、記者昨日復分頭調查獲悉此案被綁者、係吳興商人趙蓮池、諒因名字之諧音相似、以致間有傳誤、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<p>突來汽車</p>
<p>當二十六日上午十時三刻左右、公共租界愛文義路大華路口突有黑色汽車數輛、駛至該路一〇〇四弄口、車上有日人及華人多名、隨即紛紛下車、先後步入該里、直至三號、推後門登樓、當時有兩華人留守樓下及扶梯旁、其餘日人華人四名、乃逕自登樓入室、</p>
<p>避難夾滬</p>
<p>該處客堂樓之居戶、為吳興人趙蓮池、名振、年四十三歲、妻沈氏、名桂英、長女名玲娥、十三歲、子名可為、（乳名順生）現就讀於附近之立本小學、兄名連城、亦同寓該處蓮池在原籍時、會在吳興陸渡橋愼記羊毛行服務、已有多年、其兄連城、則在德勝羊毛行服務、自吳興淪陷、趙率其家人走避浙西新市鎭一帶、輾轉來滬、甫於兩三月前卜居於愛文義路一〇〇四衖三號之前樓、嗣復因羊毛業與滬上同業、有所往還、</p>
<p>挾登汽車</p>
<p>二十六日上午、其兄連城、已赴茶社與友茗敘、蓮池則猶高臥未起、其時忽有不速之客登樓、其妻以正在操作、對此輩來人亦未注意、嗣來人步入趙氏臥房、即袖出手槍、嚇禁聲張、遂挾同趙蓮池下樓、出里乘原車疾馳而去、不知所終、外傳該被綁者現幽居虹口云云、因詳細情形、現尙無法得悉、故其確實下落、尙難明瞭、</p>
<p>案情茫然</p>
<p>據記者昨往該處調查、該號二房東係一吳姓、至趙氏所居布置簡單、且極狹小、趙被挾走後、該處司閣捕、雖見趙與人同駕汽車而去、但尙不知被綁、迨捕房派探前往調查、始知底蘊、現該案被綁原因、正靜候捕房偵查之中、據其兄連城所云、渠等係因家鄉不能安居、始避難來滬、對於該案情形、殊亦茫然、</p>
<p>西報所載</p>
<p>字林報云、華人趙蓮池在本埠業運輸業、於星期四（二十六日）晨被日方架走、昨日（二十七日）被日軍當局關於「新上海旅館」（即前德鄰公寓）、聞趙寓愛文義路大華路對面某弄中、星期四晨、被日人兩名、偕華人十名、在其寓所拘去、衆信日人等此舉、並未報告該管之公共租界警務處、或與警務處會同出此、迄至昨晚、日方仍未將覊留趙氏之原因報告公共租界當局、惟一般人相信與運輸事務有若千關係、直至深晚、各方所作使趙氏開釋之努力、毫無效果、</p>

<p>被告到庭一造辯論審結候判　原告誤認法庭擬請重開辯論</p>
<p>前在永安公司屋頂花園天韻樓遊戲塲演唱灘簧之皖籍女子王彩英、即王妙金、今年二十八歲、現住公共租界七浦路義興里十三號、近延律師代理具狀向特二法院民庭、對其未婚夫甬人吳祥麟（三十歲住法租界霞飛路恩派亞影戲院對面康發西裝衣服店內）、提起</p>
<p>解除婚約</p>
<p>之訴、其起訴意旨稱、被告於民國廿五年夏開、與原告相值、渠自稱在江海關充稽查、盛誇其益進如何富足、家道如何殷實、祇因新遭鼓盆之戚、故不時出外解悶、冀於人烟稠密之中、物色相當伴侶、俾圓鸞鏡、及老覩原告、驚為天人、殷勤倍至、大有相見恨晚之慨、乃追隨不捨、竟被</p>
<p>花言巧語</p>
<p>所惑、致墮其術中、與之訂婚、幸約定於廿六年度一年中舉行結婚、詎自訂婚之後、未及二月、被告即別換面目、始則聲稱海關稽查、身心太苦、擬換輪船職務、命原告供給其保證金五百兩不應、則痛駡原告無情、聲勢汹汹、恣意侮辱、原告見之、已屬詫異、繼乃乘間潛取原告之鑽戒、經原告偕弟兄</p>
<p>前往交涉</p>
<p>始由其弟負責返還、復乘原告赴杭州進香不在家中之時、又假借原告委其修理無綫電機、在婢女手中騙去價值二百元之六燈無綫電收音機一架，查被告既如此不務正業、又用險惡手段、筆難盡述、夾日方長、常此以往、不堪設想、爲此</p>
<p>迫不得已</p>
<p>請求准予判决解除婚約云云、法院據狀、於昨日上午由吳孝恪推事開民七庭審理、原告未到、由被告一造到案、請求一造辯論、據稱民人於廿六年間定期迎娶原告、諉稱民人有嗜好、至廿七年迎娶原告又託詞戰事關係、一再推諉、實係原告之過失、民人不願解除婚約、</p>
<p>請求駁回</p>
<p>原告之訴云、庭上核情、准許被告之請、一造辯論、宣告審結、定期二月二日宣判、乃本案原告係廿七日中午接得法院之傳票、因傳票上未註明當事人應到庭、故昨日原告到法院、茫然不知此案在何庭開審、靜　於特二法院樓上第四法</p>
<p>庭內等候</p>

<p>案情複雜尙須調查　庭諭改期再行審理</p>
<p>義泰輪船公司經理曹鴻儀、將該公司前向閔南輪船公司租賃之閔行號、後改名萬納號、並懸意大利國旗之輪船一艘、及滷簞船兩只、以每月租金法幣一萬一千七百元、轉租與大公報關行主羅萬象所設之漢口輸船公司、的定航行長江口岸一綫、其航行許可證、則由漢口公司之經理蘇州人施光昌委託中日航商合開之天利輸船公司向日軍領取、迨　給付一部份租金後、忽</p>

<p>交易達九百五十兩</p>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗磐市况、情勢稍形平定、全天僅有三元差度、惟價則仍稱續趨疲、蓋某銀樓忽代本市客帮大量多頭出籠、且其他銀樓帮垃塞亦殷、加以北帮暨現金號等先後爭售、致塲中雖有天津帮與證券帮及金號等吸購、然終感供過於求、故而績跌三元、各方人心仍疲、交易尚旺、達九百五十兩、銀樓飾金亦隨之下降一元、海關金依然未更、中英純金等復向上升、</p>
<p>烚赤暗市供逾於求</p>
<p>自晨第條（十兩）、初開賣方喊二千〇二十五六元、其時銀樓帮忽來傾吐、致逐步喊低、迨至九時三刻、方見銀樓帮互做五十兩、一千〇二十一元為開盤價、繼之相同價銀樓帮售予錢兌業五十兩、及現金號售予證券帮五十兩、嗣後忽聞外匯受華北聯行猛扒、突然趨緊、日某錢兌業忽又代天津帮大量搜購、幸某銀樓（代本市殷商多頭出範、）暨客帮及現金號等供意尚佳、故漲勢有限、某錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價二十二元、又進客帮五十兩、價二十三元五角、另一錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價二十四元、某錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、及金號售予銀樓帮五十兩、價均二十三元、某錢兌業又進銀樓帮五十兩、價二十三元五角、另一錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價二十四元、某錢兌業又進銀樓帮九十兩、及現金號百兩、價均相同、錢兌業售予同業五十兩、及客帮售予證券帮五十兩、均二十三元為午收價、午後首見錢兌業售予金號五十兩、價二十三元、又見金號進錢兌業五十兩、價二十四元、此後因進者觀望、故而下挫、錢兌業互做五十兩、價二十一元、後二十一元仍有人賣出、然進者奇稀、有人僅還價十八九元買進、致雖做開、故晚收價仍為二千〇二十一元、較上日軋跌三元、現余號之本牌金售出價二千〇三十元、收進二千〇十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金兌價跟小一元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出初均未更、迨至上午十時因烚赤逼近二十元關、故乃掛小一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百〇五元、新同行懸二百〇三元、收進一百九十七元、</p>
<p>英純金回漲半便士</p>
<p>二十七日倫敦電、英純金每盎司回漲半辦士、計仍達七鎊八先令八辦士半、中央銀行之中國純金收買價亦漲達-千二百十四元、掛牌海關金依舊未更、仍為一元三角九分九釐、上海標準標金價亦隨升四角、計一千二百〇九元大概角、</p>
<h3 id="c125">外幣交易稀少 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>昨日英純金漲半辨士、英美匯兌未動、外匯華北偽銀行略有收納、港電稍有拋塞、過程穩定、烚赤交易未旺、供求尚平、趨勢微軟外幣交易稀少、市價因外滙穩定、烚赤微呈鬆動、故續微降、公會交易未做開、昨日市價、英金票降二分、美金鎊降五分、美金票降半分、香港票法郎票各降一厘、安南票降三分、坎拿大票降一分、斐律演票升二分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3 id="c126">貼現仍在盤高中 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、仍在徐徐盤高中、變動尚微、每千元終日盤於三十七元左右、最後價為卅七元、比前日微升二角半、</p>
<h3 id="c127">英銀連疲三天 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>二十七日倫敦電、投機家及大衆少數賣出、缺乏維持、市况尚平、收盤後平而帶硬、印度照掛牌高〇六二五買進、然售者仍無意供給、大條銀近期續縮一八七五、遠期亦續縮一二五、紐的銀電、美銀價依然呆定、孟買銀電，印銀市况平中稍堅、現貨與近期均長三安那、遠期亦張四安那云、</p>
<h3 id="c128">外匯益形穩定 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>「聯銀」仍在暗中活動　投機商人不為響應</p>
<p>滙市昨以「華北聯合準備銀行」又來委託本市較小範圍之銀行收進、致潛勢初會一度趨緊、英金最緊為八辦士三一二五、美金最軟為十六元二一八七五、但以中西投機家未予響應、且其後外電及西商沙遜等爭售、故形勢益覺穩定、成交殊暢、港滙因外銀行納胃頗强、且錢兌業供意不力、故潛勢仍緊、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠續縮、紐約銀價未動、倫敦生金回漲半辦士、匯兌英對美未更、對法大七生丁、對滬平平、美對英亦無變動、對法跌一二五、對滬如舊、中央掛牌各匯呆定如故、銀行早開寶價、英匯八辦士三四三七五、美匯十六元二五、較前收均平、開後外電首先塞出英金八辦士四〇六二五、而銀行趁賤則扒、故無變幻、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉冉小一分、此後「華北準備銀行」突來力吸英金八辦士三一二五及美滙十六元一二一八七五、且銀行扳價不肯廉買、致潛勢步緊、但不久西商沙遜及美行突起售出、英金八辦士三四三七五、及美滙十六元二五、而洋行及華北偽銀行吸胃不強、故為狀轉平、美金洋行可結十六元二五、將近午時成交淸淡、祇錢兌業售予華義荷蘭大通港滙五十五元六二五、午收銀行英美兩匯賣價、與晨開相同、港滙軋過則緊三七五、</p>
<h3 id="c129">證券　外債疲弱　內債停市 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>倫敦中國外債、本月二十七日（星期五）掛牌行市、市况依然疲弱不堪、上檔海關稅担保各種債券、亦續有跌落、下檔鐵路公債則無變化、英德續借款英發債票續跌二鎊、價為七十鎊、善後公債英發債票、續跌半鎊、價為四十六鎊半、均跌至本月份之最低價格，中法美金五厘公債有印債票亦續落半鎊、價為六十八鎊、惟市塲行市、買進價格照市增高七先令六辦士、現為六十八鎊七先令六辦士、至英金善後公債法發有印債票行市、買進價為四十三鎊十五先令、買出價為四十四鎊十五先令、英倫實貨供給、計有津浦鐵路原發公債英發債票一千鎊、售價十六鎊平行市又廣九鐵路公債三千五百鎊、售價十八鎊七先令六辦士、比昨盤及行市徵抑二先令六辦士、</p>
<p>上海公債因昨日為一二八滬戰紀念停市、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月二十七日（星期五）掛牌行市、仍祗麥加利股及開平股、稍有上落、麥加利銀行股回升二先令六辦士、價為八鎊十五先令、開平煤礦不記名股續跌六辦士、價為十五先令六辦士、</p>

<p>國外絲市、自前日暴跌後、昨即呈穩定、除日絲八三分在紐約續跌一分、在里昂續跌一·五〇法郎外、其他市價、包括日美交易所行情、均略回升、計紐約近期漲二分、遠期漲一分、橫濱現貨遠其各漲十三元、惟日美交易殊覺稀少、紐約整日交易僅做開三檔、計三十担、可知外銷絲市或不易即見暢動也、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、洋行白廠七八分限價為一三六〇元、但用戶無勻度絲售開仍高出三十元許、致無成交、用戶方面昨日絲價並未見軟、故絲交亦難續暢、印非莊口昨亦較靜、如日美絲價在下週能保持平穩之象、本埠內外絲市、均可納入常軌、如本週者、若繭價飛騰、內銷突盛、反陷洋行絲市於僵持、實非絲市健全之態云、</p>

<p>外棉市價、美棉殊感疲乏、一般人士均靜待歐洲之政局及華盛頓之棉業立法及貸款棉出售諸問題之解决也、昨日紐的市之遠期賣買較為熱鬧、國內廠商、亦略有新棉交易、因之十月份獨漲十磅音、印棉甚難振作、連跌已有多日、昨日述同預測又跌一羅比餘、埃及亦跌十餘磅昔、昨日滙兌無甚軒桎、折合法幣計美棉及巴西棉每據漲三角、印棉跌四角、埃及八角餘、本市外棉交易、又呈熱鬧之象、申新進胃最大、昨日又進印棉一千包、巴西棉五百包、新裕鴻章購進美棉一千包共他廠家亦有大批訂購、昨日有輪自美運來美棉三千餘包、又有巴西棉二千餘包抵埠、現正在報關中、日內送廠交卸、茲將昨日成交件額及價格分列於後、</p>

<p>一月份日紗空方勢將結價</p>
<p>咋現紗市塲停市、惟客帮方面略有交易、二十支雙馬紗現貨價為四百〇一元、天女棧單為三百九十四元至四元半、聞申新廠曾有巨量開出二十支雙馬紗四千包、價為三百九十五元、每包付定洋四十元、又據某處消息、日紗市場一月份皮球交易、空方拋出之額約有一千六百包、明日開市、大概不出於結價一法也、</p>

<p>麵粉因連日華北某大戶購辦後、先後售出十餘萬包、各廠存粉、因之减少、客銷尚活、昨為一二八之期、北帮大戶進胃巳淡、甫洋帮零星去化頗佳、廠方亦限制供給、統市由本街辦去七八千包、南北兩帮各辦一萬五六千包、二號粉各牌、悉照四元八角原盤、下脚粉交易僅二三千包、市面頗穩、昨運往烟台七千五百包、汕頭四千包、又麩皮二千包、</p>
<p>小麥來源不多、市面漲跌兩難、廠方均擬抑價牧買，貸方未肯鬆讓、全日成交額僅三千包、除阜豐廠辦去三份之一外、餘均由福新廠辦去、價格暫鮮變化、聞最近廠方直接向產區購辦之小麥、亦有數批運到、</p>

<p>客秈咋日到銷兩少、昨由滸浦來八百六十包、而統市開蕪湖秈等亦僅四百多包、南京秈因貨主不忍隨市下降、擯住不售、京秈頂貨依然喊高至十一元、而進戶尚吃不到十元〇八角、高蕪秈亦堅守十元〇五六角之價、然目下客囤兩滯、僅恃本街去路、高貨雖能擯守、而中關以下、則被本尖貶價求脫之影響、終見續削角外云、</p>

<p>豆餅一度會被江北小豆餅甩價而見軟、但其他各餅潛勢仍緊而有力、在此非常時期、各個情形不同耳、昨汕頭興化等購買頗亟、故江北小豆餅雖有濃厚之到存、然其市價亦穩、共計做開江北小豆餅五萬片、價為五角七分原盤、大有餘廠四牌餅一千片、價為三元一角九分、常州協豐廠四牌元隆餅一千三百餘片、價為三元一角七分（外棧）、及常州溥和廠四牌肥字餅一千五百餘片、價為三元一角八分五厘</p>
<p>生油昨有一千五百件運寗波、三百件運香港、</p>

<h3 id="c141">怎樣研究時事？ <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— 公懷</p>
<p>生存在這個大時代裏，世界風云的變幻，中日期戰局的蛻化，無不和我們息息相關，所以小朋友對於時事的研究，倒也是必要的。</p>
<p>步驟：</p>
<p>第一，先要具備非常淺近的地理和歷史知識，最好，能把世界現代名人的傳記，多讀一些，那末，讀報的時候，便會容易瞭解。還有，地圖是研究時事的必要工具，假使巨幅的，可以張在壁上，用三角形顏色小紙，黏在　針上，於出事處定一面，那末，下一天就不致茫無頭緒而能按圖索驥了。假使是一本一本的，則隨時翻檢，明瞭其地位及關係。</p>
<p>第二，應知道報紙和通訊社的背景，因爲每段消息，都要替自己的「主人」說話，不免有誇張或隱飾的地方，小朋友如不明白他的背景，很容易上當。譬如像現在上海的報紙，大型的幾乎全是英美商業公司所辦的，他們自然因同情我國抗戰而言論也有利於我國了。其他，像通訊社方面，路透屬英，同盟屬日，塔斯屬蘇，美聯屬美，海通屬德，中央社屬我國等，我們也不可不知道。否則，便容易中反宜傳的毒，不能對時局有準確的認識。</p>
<p>第三，最好能聯絡幾個程度相似志趣相同的同學或鄰友，組織個「時事研究會」或「時事座談會」，每週規定一，二個中心題目，定期召開，由會中聘請對時事有研究的師長或家長來出席指導。各人把自己的研究心得或見解發表出來，共同討論，如有錯誤的地方，則指導者可以隨時指正，這樣，不但可經濟時間，還可收集思廣益的效果。</p>
<p>第四，備一本簿子，把每天的重要時事摘錄下，等到一個問題解决以後，再從頭至尾，作一簡括的叙述。再備一本無用的舊書，把重要的電訊，文吿等，從報上剪下，黏貼上去，以備日後的査閱。</p>
<p>小朋友們看了上面的話，如以爲尙有意義，那末，你就照着做做看。等到你在實行中發現有不妥處，困難處或需要補充處，我們再來提出商討罷！</p>
<h3 id="c142">做一個小無綫電家 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 奚人</p>
<p>給小朋友們！</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！你們都看見過無綫電嗎？我相信，你們一定都看見過的。那麼，我問你們對它都覺得希奇嗎？怎麼一個小小的方匣子，只要一挿上電就會吚吚啞啞的唱起來？</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們不用奇怪，這是科學，只要懂了它的學理，就能明瞭它所以會發聲的道理。</p>
<p>但是這種學理很深，就是大人有時還弄不淸楚，我們現在年紀還小，只要明白它的製造法已夠，到後來慢慢的做熟了，自然慢慢的會明白它的學理了。</p>
<p>小朋友們，不知道你們歡喜這樣做嗎？倘使歡喜的話，就請你們靜靜的看下去，裏面的故事是很有趣，我想你們是一定歡喜的。</p>
<p>好了，請靜靜的聽故事吧！</p>
<p>（一）王民和他的堂哥</p>
<p>王民是國帬小學的六年級生，平時對於功課，很是用心；尤其是自然一科，每次總是考一百分。所以他在校中，很得到一班師長同學的稱贊：『王民是一個好學生』！</p>
<p>王民的父親是一家銀行裏的職員，每月的收入很多，所以每月總要給王民一點錢，但是王民不把錢亂化掉，也不買零食吃，因爲他知道不正當的零食是有害腸胃的。那麼他把這些錢做什麼用呢？他就一點點的積蓄起來，預備做一架無綫電。</p>
<p>說起他的對於無綫電發生興趣，還遠在去年夏天。那時他讀完四年級。當然，他對於無綫電是一點不懂的，却巧那時他有一個在南京念書的堂哥，因爲學校裏放暑假，就來上海住在他家裏。</p>
<p>就是他的堂哥，對於無綫電是很有研究的。能獨個子做一個四燈機，還能做收報機發報機。你們懂得什麼是收報機什麼是發報機嗎？諸位小朋友？那就是我們平時在無綫電報局裏看見的打電報用的機器，是很難做的。</p>
<p>但是王民初時還不大相信。「眞的他會造無綫電的嗎」？而且常常還要這樣說。</p>
<p>有一次，王民還親口問他的堂哥說，「哥哥，你眞的會造無綫電嗎」但是他的堂哥並沒有回答他，只對他笑笑。這，可越發引起他的疑心。</p>
<p>是他的堂哥到後的第四天——一個炎熱的下午。王民的姨到親戚家裏去了，連那個娘姨也跟了去。家裏只賸了他和他的堂哥兩人。</p>
<p>他的堂哥在一隻皮箱裏拿出來許多東西。有方的，有圓的，有扁的，有長的，有一片片的，形形式式的都有，但是王民都不認識它們的名字。</p>
<p>他好奇心的拿起一個方方的有一片一片白鐵片子的東西，翻轉倒轉的看着，看了差不多有五分鐘的樣子，還不懂是什麼東西。他又好奇心的執住在柄上，用力地一旋，不料那一片片的白鐵片子也跟着旋轉起來。這，就引起了他的驚奇，不禁向他的堂哥問道：「哥哥，這到底是什麼東西」？</p>

<p>— 鼎康</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，你們每天放學回家時，在路旁有沒有看見過小書攤。我想小朋友一定看見過的，小朋友一定也去看過的，小書攤上的小書的。</p>
<p>小書攤上的小書，價錢很便宜；只須一個銅元或三個銅元就可以借一部看。但是小書攤上看小書的小朋友，大都是窮苦人家的孩子，身上不淸潔；諸位小朋友，假使和他們坐在一條長凳上看小書，一定會生傳染病的。我朋友的弟弟，他也很喜歡看小書，每天放學回家，總要到小書攤去看小書。不料，最近他生了一身傳染病。請了醫生來看，醫生說：「這是極容易傳染的傳染病，最好注意他的飲食（就是不能吃魚吃肉）」。而且學校中還不許他讀書，他眞苦極了，到現在已有一月，傳染病還是沒有全愈。諸位小朋友，你們想一想看，爲了一個銅元看一部小書，而生了一身傳染病，這是値得不値得？</p>
<p>所以從今天起，諸位小朋友，不要再到小書攤上去看小書了，况且小書攤上的小書，一點沒有意思，小朋友看了，反要傷腦子的。假使小朋友一定要看，那末在星期日時，到各書局中去看看書籍，你喜歡的書，就買幾本回來看看。小書攤上的小書，小朋友千萬不可看的。</p>
<h3 id="c145">在中美兩國交通史上創新紀元的飛剪號 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 新生</p>
<p>中華民國和北美合眾國隔着廣闊的太平洋相對爲鄰，這兩個共和國家，雖是東西各據一洲而爲遠洋之友，可是他們無論在政治上，經濟上或文化上都有相當的關係！</p>
<p>在以前的時候，從中國到美國去，或是由美國到中國來，都要靠水路交通的：普通的郵船約需時十五日左右，最快的也要十天，若講貨船就要二十餘天了！可是自從汎美航空公司橫渡太平洋的中美航空綫成立之後，由美國到中國來，祗需要六個長距離飛航的新紀錄，就是中美兩國的關係，也因之而愈益密切，無論外交要員，著名人物，遊歷家的來往及郵件，貨物等的運輸時間，都可以因之而縮短，昔時重洋萬里，而今近如眼前，這樣的成功，我們不能不歸功於二十世紀科學發明品之應用於交通界！</p>
<p>飛剪號乃我國譯Clipper（快艇之意）之名詞，是汎美航空公司用以作長距離飛航的大飛艇，其中的夏威夷，匪列濱，中國等三艘飛剪號是向馬丁飛機廠定造的馬丁式飛艇，這種飛艇，載重二十五噸半，其上翼長達一百三十呎，下翼（即水面翼）頗短，其中每面可貯汽油七百九十加倫，除供作儲油槽外，這下翼還具有浮桴的作用，以輔停泊水面時艇身傾側中立之不足；艇上備有發動機四具，每具馬力一千匹，這四具發動機分裝於上翼，左右各二；飛航速率每小時可達一百六十五哩；每艘飛艇除載駕駛人家員等七人外，尙可載乘客三十人及郵件，貨物等。重載時起飛，祗需四五十秒時間即可，飛航高度通常在八千呎左右，但亦有高至一萬三千呎，低至距海面千餘呎之時。</p>
<p>中美飛航最初用汎美飛剪號（十八噸），試飛，在太平洋諸島間經二十餘次之試飛後，中國飛剪號始於二十四年十一月二十二日由美飛至馬尼拉，此綫在二十五年十月二十一日正式通航。至二十六年四月二十八日香港飛剪號在馬尼拉接運中國飛剪號由美運來之郵件飛澳門轉港，再經中航飛機運滬，這是第一次中美正式通航的吿成，但自戰事發生以後，汎美公司仍以馬尼拉爲遠東的終點站。這一條航空綫，從美國的舊金山經檀香山，中程島，威克島，關島，馬尼拉而至香港，全程長八千六百餘哩，沿綫各站均設有電訊，測候，膳宿，燃料，輔助，機械修理等設備，汎美航空公司對這綫可說得是極盡其力了！但是從去年起，一月間即有薩摩亞飛剪號之失事，七月末又有夏威夷飛剪號之失踪，汎美公司受損不貲，可是他們仍是努力飛航工作，使太平洋航空綫繼續不斷，這種前進的服務精神，是極値得我們欽佩的！</p>
<p>小朋友，你對這種橫幅　太平洋，連接亞美兩洲交通的長途飛航是否感到興趣？！</p>

<p>—明兒避難記之十一—</p>
<p>在這小河上駛行了的第二天下午，船夫們盡了全身的力趕着路，打算這天傍晚到達杭州，可是在時間上已不許了，明兒的父親曾吿訴船夫必須在小鎭附近的地方過夜，這比較安全一些，如果歇在冷落，曠野附近的村中，而遇到不測之事，怎麼辦？連喊都喊不應。可是今天無論如何是趕不到杭州，而且在附近的小鎭一個也沒有，同時天也漸漸的黑了下來，於是船夫認不得方向，只好在附近的岸邊停了，明兒父親急急的問那船夫：「這裏好不好」？船夫含糊的答着：「不要緊的」。明兒把頭伸出了船艙向外面望望，一片茫茫的荒野，沒有一些聲音，沒有一個人跡，更沒有一點火光，漆黑黑的，祗有一二株的大樹點輟着，陰森森的，使明兒一根根的汗毛都豎起了，他滿肚子懷着恐怖，暗暗的想着：「如果晚上來了幾個强盜，獰惡的臉，粗暴的手，雪亮的刀……」他愈想愈怕了，</p>
<p>那天晚上，天空中密佈着烏黑的雲，沒有星，沒有月，更沒有光，那三艘小船躱在一堆蘆葦的深處，靜靜地躺着，遠遠的望來，似三點小小的螢火，閃閃爍爍在蘆葦中停着。明兒的心中依然跳個不停，家人們都縮頭縮脚的躺下了。明兒在這硬綳綳的船板上坐着，而又担心這天晚上將有不幸的遭遇，怎樣能睡熟，頭放在東不好，西也不好，竟沒有放處，愈是睡不着，東想想，西望望，更加重了恐怖的心情，船艙裏船夫的鼾聲一時發作起來，那鬼火般的油燈也熄滅了。眼前的一切達到了極度的漆黑竟連伸出了自己的手都望不出</p>
<p>外面起了一陣子如獅吼般的狂風，呼呼的打在蘆葦葉上，更發出了簌簌的聲音，好似在響應着，那風更從船板的罅兒中直刮在明兒的臉上。他這時正在迷迷糊糊的，竟被它驚醒了。張大了耳朶，聽得外面風聲在狂吼，更夾雜着一陣雜亂的脚步聲，他這時恐慌極了，一時竟呌了起來。這呌聲驚醒全船的人，他母親更到他旁邊，拉着他的手問道：「明兒，明兒，你怎麼啦」？明兒的臉上一時變了靑白，眼睛瞪得大大的，兩隻手冰冰冷，他母親知道他是受了驚嚇了，於是他母親開口說：「明兒，你不要嚇」。明兒才漸漸的鎭定了，聽得外面除了風聲之外，一切都寂靜着，那裏來的脚步聲，這是自己的神經一時錯亂了。他便開口說：「我剛才在糊裏糊塗快要睡熟的時候，忽然聽得一陣脚步聲，我心中嚇極了，一時竟不知不覺的呌了起來，現在我知道我自己在嚇自己呢」。那時他才漸漸的恢復了常態，手中都暖了。外面的風依然在狂吼着，一陣陣的冷風仍刮在明兒的臉上，一時使他寒噤了好一會兒，他已深深的嘗到了難民的苦味。可是沒有一刻，他便入了睡鄉，只能在睡鄉中稍能安慰他的痛苦了</p>
<h3 id="c147">白雪公主（五） <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 天孫</p>
<p>但它們睡熟了不久，忽又醒了回來，原來有一片快樂的歌聲，很響朗的從森林中傳送過來，直送進它們的耳朶。</p>
<p>它們知道這一片快樂的歌唱之聲，是暗示這小屋子裏的主人已在回來，並且一步步的逼近了。但那嬌小的白雪公主因爲疲倦已極，一些兒也不聽得，一些兒也不知道，伊還是很安靜的睡在樓頭臥房裏的三張小床上。</p>
<p>如今我們要回過去講那王宮中的情形了。王后自從發下了那殺害白雪公主的惡毒的命令之後，在那光滑的大理石地板上往來踱着，很不耐的等候那獵官回來銷差，好聽取白雪公主慘死的消息。等了好久，獵官果然來了，把那個鑲嵌寳石的匣子，雙手捧呈王后。王后微微一笑，知道他已遵照自己的命令一一辦妥了。可是伊那裏知道這寳匣中所裝着的，並不是白雪公主的心，却是那獵官在森林裏打死了一頭野豬，把它的心來冒充的。</p>
<p>當下伊又急急地趕到那密室中的魔鏡前去，對着鏡子顧影自憐了一回，便驕傲地問道：「牆上的仙鏡啊！我要問你，現在那一個是世界中最美麗的女子？」</p>
<p>不道那魔鏡所回答的話，却完全出於伊的意外，而不是伊所願意聽的。只聽得鏡中放聲答道：「在那七寳山上，第七瀑外，七矮人的小屋子裏，住着那白雪公主，伊是世界中最美麗的女子！」</p>
<p>王后獰笑了一下，取出那寳匣來，放在鏡前，冷冷地說道：「白雪早已死了。瞧啊——這寳匣裏頭，就是伊的心！」</p>
<p>那魔鏡聽了這話，却又放出似嘲似諷的聲音來答道：「白雪公主依然活着，伊是世界中最美麗的女子。你手中寳匣裏頭所裝着的，寳在是一顆野豬的心！」</p>
<p>王后一聽之下，大發雷霆，忍不住的破口咆哮起來，原來那獵官竟違背了伊的命令，私下裏把白雪公主放走了。伊定了定神，便自言自語道：「這可惡的奴才，竟敢破壞我的事情，我一定要好好的收拾他，才能平我心頭之氣。但我第一步還是要對付白雪這小東西。我得先到那矮人們的屋子裏去，結果了伊，不到一天，我又是世界中最美麗的女子了。」</p>
<p>可憐白雪公主當初以爲這小屋子，是七個孤兒所住的，不道並不是什麼孤兒，而是七個矮人。他們年紀很老，生得却很矮小，又個個是很好頑的滑稽人物。幾百年來，他們天天到一座大山下去，在他們的　中工作，勤勤懇懇地工作了一整天，到太陽落下去的時候，便拋下了鐵鎬，同聲唱起歌來道：「嗨哇，嗨哇，我們的工作完了，回到家裏去了。」</p>
<p>就是這一片回家的歌聲，遠遠到屋子裏來，驚醒了那些熟睡中的小動物，紛紛的溜到屋外去了。惟有白雪公主還是睡在樓上，繼續地做伊的好夢。</p>

<p>— 彦公</p>
<p>「噤若寒蟬」是形容出一個弱者敢怒而不敢言，或心有隱衷的用語，這裏面不知包藏多少的悲慘怨憤的酸辣苦味。有例可證，報載：</p>
<p>「日本下院開會，對於政府計劃，各議員已一致投以信任票，並表示完全合作。惟目前日本國會祗能作贊同政府之工作，議會機能早已喪失；卽如昔日反對政府政策之議員，今已噤若寒蟬，默不發言。」</p>
<p>「天津英法兩租界與華界交通之處，僅爲一深長窄狹甬道可通。出入華界，須脫光衣襪，赤身露体，不分男女，立於甬道聽候細細搜査。在此冬季寒風凜冽之際，來往行人，赤身鵠立道上，無不戰慄不已，苟稍吐怨言，必須拳打脚踢。等人受此虐待，唯有忍辱含羞，噤若寒蟬而已。」</p>
<p>這兩則新聞，主體雖有不同，一則是堂堂國會議員，一則是正在鐵蹄下遭遇蹂躪的細民，然而他們的處境，正復相同，其哀苦無告的情緖亦復一致。不必說，在淪陷區的中國人民，天天過着水深火熱的生活，一任他們的生殺予奪，便是日本的人民，在軍閥的暴厲好戰的高壓下，何嘗能有一些自由，一點保障。甚至那般高高在上的國會議員，雖然事到如今，已看破了軍閥的虛偽宣傳，已感覺到國運的危如纍卵，但是他們早已被軍閥制服得不敢異動，於是乎大家便只有「噤若寒蟬」。</p>
<h3 id="c155">東京的動物 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 戈兒</p>
<p>日本人的「戰時節約運動」，的確成績要比我們中國的來得好。前些時候看到日本的小學生連皮鞋也沒的穿，因此我看到我們的「小朋友」非但沒有赤脚，並且在上海連「兒童服裝公司」也有几爿開起來了，心中不免有點黯然，人家是侵略的國家，情願把小學生的皮鞋也「節約」起來，而充實侵略的力量。而我們中國呢，是個被侵略的國家，如果抗戰不利，那末「奴隸」的命運就要立刻落到全國每個同胞的頭上。</p>
<p>後來在報上又得知日本內閣大臣慶賀什麽也禁飲香檳，大喝米酒了。這種自上麵下的厲行節約的精神，眞是偉大得很，又如最近「華中司令」畑俊六「大將」衣錦榮歸，皇室因爲節省煤油計，已將汽車完全擱至不用，所以迎接這位「大將」的車輛，很爲報歉，也不得不用「馬車」了。</p>
<p>最近報紙上又有一則「日本動物園中獅虎亦參加戰時節約運動」據那則新聞說：「東京動物園獅子兩頭，竟亦參加全國戰時節約運動，棄馬肉而以兎肉魚類飼之。兩獅每日兩餐，以兎肉代馬肉者，已厲數月。但生鯖魚三條作晚餐者，由兎肉而「近始行之」的生鯖魚三條，在這種情况下，大槪還要節約下去是無疑的。雖然據看守者報吿：「最初數日，兩獅不食此魚，但今則兩獅食魚亦津津有味云。」不過不得食肉而食魚是不是還會「津津有味」，這還待「試騐」之後而知，不過獅子的這種「節約」無論如何是有限度的。</p>
<p>「獅子餓的時候是要怒吼的！」這樣，我對「日本動物園中的獅虎亦參加戰時節約運動」，不免有點替我們的「友邦」担憂起來了！</p>

<p>瘋狂的風發出呼呼的得意笑聲，枯黃的樹叶逼出瑟瑟的悲哀嘆息，這种景象顯出可惡的，殘酷的冬天降臨，暗示出弱肉强呑的悲慘景色。</p>
<p>在某一個夜裏，時候差不多已經十二點鐘了，馬路兩旁的商店，出了烟紙店，吃食店，老虎灶，及幾爿無名小店外，大都已經關上了門窗，停止了一天的營業。柏油的馬路上，幸得路燈發出微弱的光芒，和店裏的燈光，才使得路上一些光亮，路上一切都表示出寂靜情况，除了路旁的梧桐，三四把人力車，和幾個穿着厚呢大衣的夜行人外，一切都沒有；這是多麽悲慘的，寂靜的冬夜呀！</p>
<p>「×……×……晚報」！這是賣晚報的呌聲，由遠處隨風而來；這個喊聲裏，夾雜着耐不住寒冷的嘆息。一個年近五十左右的人，身上披着一件襤褸的黑色棉布襖，下面穿着一條短的破袴子，脚上拖着一雙沒有後跟的鞋子，手裏拿着幾張××晚報，從遠處走近來，呌喊的聲音也跟着慢慢的接近了。然而他自從接到報紙以來，沒有好幾個顧客光臨過；雖然他肚子裏，還是空空的，不時發出飢餓的微音；他摸摸袋裏的錢，除了本錢以外，還賺不到買一些點心，在絕無辦法下，祗好吃些冷風充充飢了。他在生活壓迫下，不得不下了一個决心，去響着他的吼聲，向前面進行，想引起顧客的光臨，以滿足一些他的希望——但是路上已經如此的冷寞，行人寥寥可數的時候，那希望怎樣能夠達到呢？但他不問，祗向前進行而吼着。</p>
<p>其後，他的喊聲已經沙啞了，嘴也幹喝了，脚冷得發僵硬了，但他也不顧，仍舊發出最後一些吼聲而向前進行着。</p>
<h3 id="c157">割「生殖腺」 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 力士</p>
<p>生殖腺（Gonita　Gland）是生理學名詞，一名性腺。雄性的便是睪丸，雌性的便是卵巢。睪丸和卵巢，除產生精細胞，卵細胞之外，兼營內分泌作用，于生理上是已關重要的。</p>
<p>生殖腺是繁殖人口，延續人類的必要工具。倘使人沒有生殖腺，現在的世界，不知又將變成怎麽樣了。</p>
<p>人有智愚賢不肖，據遺傳學者說，智賢生者爲智賢，愚不肖生者愚不肖。「龍生龍，鳳生鳳，老鼠生來掘壁洞。」這雖是句民間批評人種的俗語，却也是受了遺傳學的影響。因此，人類學者哥爾德氏爲求人種性格和身體的益臻優良，也曾主張根據門德爾遺傳律，以選擇配偶，淘汰惡種，留存善種。優生學於焉發軔，生殖腺也從此開始遭遇到厄運。</p>
<p>據最近消息：日本民政黨議員認爲提倡種族優生，爲今日迫切要圖，擬在議會中提出割生殖腺議案，以推進此舉。他們根據的理由和具體的辦法，電訊中並未述及，當然無從臆測。不過，我們以人的眼光來觀察，所謂「優秀」的大和民族，在現在確乎需要設法改進了。</p>
<p>大和民族的軍人，在中國新表現的性格是：橫暴，貪戾，好淫，好殺，不僅身受其道的中國同胞，在痛惡咒罵，即是正義的友邦人士，目擊這種暴行，也要唾棄譴責。這不僅是人類的恥辱，也是人類的罪惡。然而這一事實的表現，我們不能全說是大和民族先天的遺傳，麵是他們軍閥所倡導的仇華政策的結果，換句話說：是由於後天的訓育。爲了這，我們認爲民政黨議員提出「種族優生保護案」而主張割生殖腺，似乎是還沒有做到「切中時弊」的地步。難怪會招致「各方面紛起的其勢甚烈的反對」當然，反對的最大背景，是法西斯軍閥。法西斯軍閥爲要大量的侵略工具，在不久以前，曾經唆使過去提倡節制生育的所謂學者，倡說獎勵生育。而今割生殖腺，根本去除生死腺的機能，怎能容忍。於此則更見民政黨議員的「不識時務」了。</p>
<p>不過話要說回來，現在日本的議會，已在日本軍閥的魔掌之中，一般議員對於國家大計，都「噤若寒蟬」，不敢多言，以免捋虎鬚，攖虎威。他們出席議會，宛如上書塲，聽故事；爲敷衍門面，應付「轎夫」起見，不得不想出一些新奇的，無關宏旨的議題，來起一塲論爭，調和調和議塲的沉鬱空氣。你看「割生殖腺」一名詞，多麽引人注意。但我們不要忘記這正是日本議會沒落時日本議員所發出的悲鳴。</p>
<h3 id="c158">軍校風光 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“Brother　Rat”</p>
<p>華納公司出品　國泰戲院映</p>
<p>關於美國影片以海軍陸軍作爲影片背景的，我們大約可以看出兩點：（一）就是宣示美國在擴張軍備中，顯示了他們海陸軍的威力，過去許多這樣影片攝製時，都取得政府海陸軍當局的同意，並且由政府給予他們很大的助力上看來，這種對世界威脅性的意義，是鮮明而易見的；（二）不在軍備上，顯示美國海陸的大砲，航空母艦的威力，是把影片重心，放在現在現在美國政府，是怎樣嚴格地訓練他們海陸軍的新人，去應付下一次更恐怖的大戰。</p>
<p>過去的「海闊天空」及「軍訓威嚴」就代表這種典型的影片的。</p>
<p>「軍校風光」也正是和「軍訓威嚴」相似的影片：以美國陸軍學校爲背景，同時却特別强調地去描寫這些年輕力壯的少年軍人，在學校的時候，是怎樣的放蕩不羈，是怎樣一天到晚在桃色氣氛裏打滾，他們不單敢闖到校長的家裏，對校長女兒調情，甚至於這晚胡鬧的學生，還把那些年靑的女郎帶到陸軍學校的宿舍裏去。在這樣一個嚴肅的主題下，通過瞭色情，糜爛的美國劇作者，使這一個代表美國陸軍學生生活的「軍校風光」也變成了一個調情的聖地了。</p>
<p>戲劇應該是反映社會的，但通過了美國劇作者之手，一世眞實的題材，都變成一篇糊塗賬「軍校風光」不過是其中一個很小的例子。</p>
<p>據此，我們可以說，「軍校風光」是失去了它的眞實性的，戲劇雖然有它的誇張性，但失去了眞實的戲劇，它的估價，當然也是很低落的了。</p>
<p>這個劇本原來是舞臺古劇改編的，雖然出塲的人物支配得相當活潑，但戲的發展，大多是在那一間宿舍中看來，它究竟沒有脫離了舞臺劇的範疇。</p>
<p>不過，在編製手法上看，這自然是一個相當成功的影片：三個男主角的性格，二個女主角的丯姿，都在影片中露了每一個人物的特質；那個膽大妄爲的比雷；那個憎惡女性的克勞馥；那個性情幽沉的愛德華；這三個人物，除了克勞馥的性質還不夠鮮明以外，比雷與愛德華的性格，是抓取得很强固活潑的。</p>
<p>至於全劇的氣氛，在威廉凱萊一手支持之下，它的調子，不單明快，而且更詼諧異常；我們不是說，因導演手法的卓越，便掩飾了全劇的色情，歪曲的毒質，不過，在導演所運用的許多手法中，值得我們學習的地方，確實是很多的。</p>
<p>我們可以由以下最顯著的兩個塲面裏，看出威廉凱萊手法之一斑：（一）愛德華尙滯留卓茜家中，突然外面有集合軍號，愛德華擬向外奔，突然想起帽子，他回進來，卓茜，卓茜的姑母，女傭人，都跟着愛德華在全室轉，愛德華到那裏，他們跟到那裏，這時愛德華果然在找帽子，就是觀衆也在替愛德華找帽子，直到愛德華在茶椅上拿到帽子，才把這塲戲滑過去；這塲戲很平淡，但經過威廉凱萊的處理，它便成很生動的一塲戲了；（二）陸軍校長的女兒格萊爾偷入比雷宿舍，敎愛德華化學一塲戲，雖然所引用的手法是舞臺化的，但通過了窒息，緊張的氣氛中，它是深深地抓住了觀衆的情感的。它所引用的手法，第一次是人影的幌動，宿舍內的關燈，惶亂的躲藏；第二次是校長以手電筒進來査夜；第三次是比雷帶卓茜敲窗進來；第四，是査宿舍的舍監，突然進來，所有人物正在喝　吃麵包，舍監一進來，大家躲藏不及，導演對於室內混亂的情致，描寫得活潑透了。同時這時大家都想，這次一定是完了，而劇作者使校長的女兒伸出頭來，說：「校長也不會歡喜知道的呀！」作爲全劇的結束，是夠聰明的。</p>
<p>演員我以爲演愛德華的愛地愛爾勃性格最顯明，也最成功，其餘如溫毛立斯，潘麗茜拉蘭琪恩蕙門等都很流利自然</p>

<p>第三回　仰遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生</p>
<p>且說金澹雲小姐同着何家兩位小姐及其未婚夫，在陵村餐室吃飯。因爲今天是星期日，來游先烈墓的人很多，都到這裏來吃飯，一刻兒便覺得士女如雲。汪靜便去招呼別位客人去了，當然，這個後軒，也沒有七八個座頭，招待的也不獨汪靜一人。汪靜走開，別人也來招呼，但是客人自己添飯，現在已經視爲當然了。近來的靑年男女，都以養成一種驕惰之風爲可恥。我旣是一個人類，我也有四肢百體，我不是一個殘廢，爲什麽一些身邊小事，要別人來代替我做呢？在十餘年前，有些富豪家的少爺小姐，動輒呼奴使婢，茶來開口，飯來伸手。這種風氣，到了戰后新興的中國，已經改革了不少咧。雖然像何家兩位小姐，他們是生長在豪華門弟，又一向在外國，不曾在國內經受什麽戰爭亂離之苦。然而她們回到祖國來看看，也覺得今後中國的復興，全在吾輩男女靑年的肩頭上，不是可以暇豫享福的時代咧。今天這一桌子吃飯的四個人，都是到過外國的，所以他們隨便談談，都要談到了國外。林建成道：『在六十年以前，中國人是瞧不起外國人。說中國是禮義之邦，外國是蠻夷之族，甚而至於在文字裏，也用了那種惡劣不堪的字眼，加在他們身上。譬如英吉利三字，每一個字偏旁，都要加一個口字，成爲　咭唎，方能見之於官文書。又如稱外國人，呼之曰洋鬼子。難然上海是個通商地方，中外雜處，也依舊呼之爲什麽鬼，如手於鬼洋琴鬼之類。這種自大的心理，終不可改。到後來一個反　力，變了外國人什麽東西都是好的。外國人有什麽東西，中國人也要有什麽东西。中國古書上說的，東施效顰，眞是一點也不錯。自然，歐美是先進國他們有許多發明，我們坐享其成，叨了他們的光不少。不過有的可以學的；有的不必學的；有的在歐美成績很好，到中國來就不行；有的在歐美是個高尙的職業，一到中國來就糟了』。指着金小姐道：『就是你現在的嚮導員，在十餘年前大家視爲一種卑賤的職業呀』！（二五）</p>

<p>武松與潘金蓮</p>
<p>在上海看過三齣「武松與潘金蓮」，一齬是周信芳主演的，一齣是蓋呌天主演的；一齣是最近在黃金看于素蓮所演唱的。</p>
<p>周信芳所演的，是歐陽予倩的脚本，和其他人等所演的不同，詞句中，有不少帶有民族性的新名詞。信芳之武松，以有勁著稱，表情，演技，當非蓋五所能望其項背。且信芳是劇，注重於演技，非如蓋五之以武二賣錢，故以實際論，當以信芳是劇演來最為精彩。惟兩度觀信芳演是劇，一次以趙嘯瀾配潘金蓮，一次以王熙春配潘金蓮，不甚佳妙。且飾武大之李瀚三，藝允不足道，致信芳孤掌難鳴，未能收牡丹綠葉之效。以我三次所觀之「武松與潘金蓮」論，搭配最為整齊者，允推蓋五所演。前觀蓋五演斯劇，以北來之李桂雲飾潘金蓮，王筱芳飾西門慶，更佐以善飾武大著稱之壽小山，配武大，其搭配之齊整，可謂佳矣。最近于素蓮在黃金演斯劇，以馬盛龍飾武松，李君玉飾西門慶，藝皆平平。素蓮雖善演潑旦戲，但描摹潘金蓮，則未能恰到好處，故是劇演來，致不能差强人意，所喜者，飾武大之劉韻亭，藝頗可取，無形中發現此一新人才。</p>
<p>劉韻亭與劉斌崑劉韻芳為昆仲行，武生底子，以乃兄斌崑為江南之名丑，韻亭得乃兄之指點，兼工開口跳，斌崑演武大，江南堪稱首屈一指。唯其輕易不動，故知者甚鮮，韻亭之腿工，極有根底，走矮子翻斛斗，會經下過一番苦工，此次在黃金一漏，頗為一般人仕所激賞。蓋小山之武大，誠然不錯，可惜他是崑腔底子，滿嘴蘇白，要和韻亭相較，蓋小山又略遜一籌了。</p>
<p>因為劉韻亭之武大，一鳴驚人，事實更告訴我們，劉斌崑演武大，是一定精彩的。上海的坤旦，善演潘金運的是毛劍秋，我很想向伶界聯合會建議，如果在會戲的時候，排一齣武松與潘金運一，由周信芳蓋呌天分飾武松，毛劍秋飾潘金蓮，而配以劉斌崑之武大，不但能够號召一時，這也可以說是一齣空前絕後的好戲了。</p>

<p>差不多在一個月之前，就聽說美專要來一個與別的晝展不同的畫展。這僩晝展終於在昨日極度的擁擠中看到了。我在里面足足流連了一個多鐘頭，果然給我發現了幾個不同別的晝展的特點。</p>
<p>第一個特點是這一個展覽會的收人全部捐助難民，不像別的名為救難畫展而只提成救濟或收回筆墨費。</p>
<p>第二個特點是會塲裏的中西畫作品雖有定價，但都有一個號碼，只要出五元貿一張畫券，就可以抽到一張美專師生和許多名家的作品。上星期在大新展覽的美專校長劉海粟的國筆，起碼要五十元一張，現在在這裏只花五元就可抽得。</p>
<p>第三個特點是在展覽期內由美專同學當塲為來賓寫生肖像。這一個特點也就是三個特點中的特點。</p>
<p>人是那麼多，圍成一座半圓的肉屏風，裏面有一個深眼鷹鼻的中年人在做着臨時的模特兒，給五個美專的男女學生寫生肖像，連觀衆四五百隻眼睛都釘住他一個人。約莫十五分鐘就畫好了。當一張一張由每一個美專的同學的手中放到他的面前時，他像選擇鏡子一般的照看着自己的小影。</p>
<p>「都像！那張不要，我竟剔不出！」</p>
<p>他不忍釋手地一張張地翻看。但照章是拿一張給一張畫券，拿兩張給兩張畫券，都像都拿去就需要五張畫券了。終於得到了會塲人員的許可，給了三張畫券，另外二張算是奉送的。</p>
<p>當那人離開坐位滿意地回去的時候，看似很勞瘁但還是那麼與畫的美專同學，又不停筆地在替另一位女性來賓寫生肖像了。</p>

<p>Japanese Army Boldly Crosses the River to Invade the West, Ambushed with Numerous Deaths; Surrounded and Blockaded by Encirclement Troops, Remnants Flee to Jiang County; Chinese Commander Visits the Front Again, Morale Greatly Boosted</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a telegram from Shaanxi, due to the Japanese army repeatedly increasing troops in Jin and Sui, the Chinese side is also strengthening defenses in the Northwest. The current strength of the Chinese side is several times greater than that of the Japanese, and the weaponry is also quite sophisticated. It is impossible for the Japanese to break through. A certain commander recently visited the front again, greatly boosting morale. Japanese harassment in western Shanxi has indeed resulted in nearly ten thousand casualties. The Japanese army is still constantly moving on the Tongpu Railway and various highways, and fierce fighting is about to resume. (Special dispatch, 9 PM, 28th)</p>
<p>(Dali) In the middle of this month, the Japanese army advanced westward from Jixian County. In order to lure the Japanese deep and annihilate them in one fell swoop, the Chinese army ordered troops in central Shanxi to circle behind the Japanese, and another unit retreated to the Yellow River along the border of Yichuan, Shaanxi. At that time, because the river was sealed by ice, the Chinese army, after crossing the river, immediately used bombs to break the ice and ambushed in separate locations. More than a thousand Japanese soldiers boldly crossed the river to invade the west. When the Japanese army advanced to the middle of the river, the Chinese army immediately used machine guns to fiercely strafe them. The number of Japanese soldiers who died in the river reached more than six hundred.

<h3 id="e13">Where are the Youth of Shanghai Going? <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>At least several hundred thousand or even nearly a million young people currently live in Shanghai, including the native youth who have always lived in Shanghai, and the youth who have fled to Shanghai from various war zones and guerrilla areas after the August 13th Incident. The youth of Shanghai were originally the outstanding members of the country; even those who fled to Shanghai from various places were in fact above the average level in terms of economic ability and education. If such a large number and outstanding quality of young people were distributed to the mainland, they would undoubtedly be the most active members of the war of resistance camp. At the front line, in the rear, in the trenches, in the hospitals, and even in all work departments, their strength would be manifested everywhere. Now, the environment makes these many young people live in seclusion on an isolated island, the environment separates the active hearts of Shanghai youth from the areas suitable for their activity; at the same time, the current Shanghai, the educational facilities and cultural undertakings, the content shows an abnormal shrinkage, can never make young people feel satisfied. Therefore, a kind of depressed mental phenomenon is popular among the young people in Shanghai today. In the school composition papers, in the letters of young people, and in the readers' columns of newspapers, the sadness and indignation of young people are revealed everywhere. They do not mourn economic poverty, nor do they express the pain of unrequited love, but only state a kind of spiritual boredom that cannot express the work of saving the country. From the standpoint of the national country, this is certainly a good phenomenon of the progress of youth thought; but at the same time, it can also be said to be a contradictory fact of the inconsistency of supply and demand in the general mobilization of national manpower.</p>
<p>How to seek a way out for the youth of Shanghai can be said to be an important issue worthy of discussion in today's isolated island society. In the past, newspapers and other publications discussed this issue very enthusiastically. To sum up, there are only two kinds of views: The first view encourages young people to go to the mainland to do the work of saving the country, because so many vitality is stagnant on the isolated island, it is better to disperse them to useful places so that they can each get what they want; the second view believes that Shanghai is not without things to do, and young people do not necessarily have to participate in many direct work, it is better to stick to their posts and make efforts in their own positions. These two statements originally have their own reasons and their own drawbacks, because a few people with childish diseases or who hold the idea of苟安 can respectively defend his actions with that kind of wonderful words; at the same time, the correct path that each person takes often depends on the decision of his own environment, so despite the lengthy discussions, the way out for the youth on the isolated island is still a major problem.</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance has entered a new stage, the camp of the Chinese national war of resistance needs to be enriched again, so the problem of the way out for the youth of Shanghai should have a reasonable solution, at least the youth of Shanghai themselves should have a clear understanding. Every young person should carefully analyze his own environment, and at the same time carefully analyze his own abilities and personality. If the environment and ability both allow a young person to leave Shanghai, this young person may leave Shanghai, because this can exert more efficiency for the future of the war of resistance. Where to go after leaving Shanghai? In fact, it is currently better to go to the guerrilla areas around Shanghai than to go to the mainland, and the efficiency of work is higher. Because the second phase of the war of resistance is the most important period of guerrilla warfare, in the guerrilla areas, such as the implementation of military political work, the development of the people's non-cooperation movement, everywhere needs young people to participate; and young people on the isolated island to participate in this kind of work in the nearby guerrilla areas, not only the journey is closer, but also all the customs are easier to understand, it can be said to be a very suitable thing. If the environment does not allow a young person to leave Shanghai, he can only stay, but the so-called "post" and the so-called "positional effort" should be based on the standard of being definitely not away from the front line of the war of resistance. Otherwise, there is a suspicion of "苟安". How can it be considered not to leave the war of resistance front line? The most important thing is that every young person should participate in an organization for saving the country. Shanghai is not without work to do to save the country, but it is really impossible for an individual entity to save the country alone, only an organization can take action and only an organization can take effective action. Today, the four million people on the isolated island of Shanghai are all enthusiastically supporting the war of resistance and building the country, but they lack an organization to do a strong maintenance. This large organization of four million people should be started and used as a core by the youth organization of hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

<p>Wu Peifu States He Will Not Be Used; Wang Jingwei Also Appears Depressed Recently</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the rumors that Wu Peifu will go to Kaifeng to take up the post of so-called "Chairman of the Pacification Committee," opinions from political circles are as follows: (1) The Japanese army is currently buying up frustrated Chinese figures in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places to call for peace, with Wu Peifu being the most well-known. The Japanese side claims that Wu Peifu will go to Kaifeng as a representative for peace talks. However, the Japanese side is still unaware that this is merely a dream because Chongqing does not want to negotiate peace. (2) The Japanese side attempts to use the Kaifeng area as a buffer zone to move the Japanese army in Xuzhou north to participate in the attack on Shanxi. The reason why the Japanese side sent Wu Peifu to Kaifeng is to create a false atmosphere of peace because Kaifeng is extremely close to the Chinese front lines. (3) Appointing Wu Peifu as "Chairman of the Pacification Committee" is another major error in the Japanese political strategy towards China. The Japanese side may not know that Wu Peifu is just as patriotic as the Kuomintang members in terms of resisting Japan. The Japanese side may mistakenly believe that the Chinese army will adopt a peaceful attitude towards Wu Peifu. It is quite possible that Wu Peifu will bring Japanese firearms in Kaifeng to return to the Chinese side. (4) Although the Japanese side wants to work hard to create an atmosphere of peace by using puppets, it continues to fight in Guangdong, Shanxi, and other areas. Therefore, the Chinese army will never lightly believe the lies of peace. Chongqing's determination to resist Japan will never waver. (American Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)</p>

Japanese agents travel between Hanoi and Hong Kong in an endless stream. As to whether Wang Jingwei will accept their "advice" or not, it is unknown. According to reports, Wang Jingwei is currently still in Hanoi, appears depressed, and adopts a "three nos" policy, namely, not participating in the puppet government, not advocating scorched-earth resistance, and not regarding the Hiranuma cabinet as an object for negotiating Sino-Japanese peace. Furthermore, according to reports, the Hiranuma cabinet has definitively abandoned Konoe's plan to organize a "central government." Hiranuma believes that it is most important to have the Chinese people subject to Japanese control. Organizing a "mixed government" or "central government" is deemed unnecessary. At the same time, he advocates inviting Wang Jingwei to use his past influence to organize a puppet government in South China to help Japan control China. It is said that wooing Wu Peifu is also part of Hiranuma's plan. (American Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Political figures here were greatly amused to hear that the Japanese inspectors in Beiping changed Wu Peifu's personal telegram into a telegram addressed to the whole country. They called this a "laughable insult." This kind of trick is likely to strengthen Wu Peifu's anti-Japanese attitude. (American Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Recently, Wu Peifu's representative declared to foreign journalists here that over the past two days, there have been repeated reports of peace telegrams and speeches involving General Wu, etc., which are all untrue. These messages are all fabricated by the Japanese side, attempting to confuse domestic and foreign audiences, which is absolutely not the case. The representative finally said that General Wu is determined to uphold his previous spirit and integrity, strictly rejecting any threats or inducements, and will never do anything that would let down the common people. Now, all sectors of the Chinese community have heard this news and expressed their approval, believing that since Wu has decided not to be used by the Japanese side, Japan's conspiracy to seek peace has suffered another serious blow.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to a Hanoi dispatch on the 27th, Wang Jingwei, who lives in the suburbs of Hanoi, was suddenly assassinated yesterday. However, his condition is unknown. After being injured, Wang Jingwei made excuses of a cold and refused to see guests. But it is heard that his injuries are not serious. It is learned that before the assassination, Wang Jingwei had originally planned other activities to incite the Kuomintang's division on the issue of peace. Unexpectedly, he was now assassinated and injured. It is also heard that during Wang Jingwei's recuperation period, all external contacts will be handled by his confidant, Zeng Zhongming.

<p>The Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University Appeals to the Nation, Hoping to Provide Active Assistance to the Best of Their Ability</p>
<p>(London) Today's The Times published a letter from Gordon, the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, appealing for Chinese universities. The letter reads, "General public opinion in Oxford is outraged by the destruction of Chinese universities. These universities are now forced to move to remote areas in the western provinces, practicing the ancient custom of Chinese education, lecturing without books or equipment. We, who are members of the scholarly community, feel obligated, as we have done our duty to Leuven after the European War and Tokyo after the earthquake. We now propose to cooperate with the International Student Service, the Joint Committee of Christian Universities in China, and the Chinese Committee of various universities, to the best of our ability, to supply Chinese universities with books, equipment, and any other possible assistance. As for relief work, the International Student Service has already started it and is quite effective, and we plan to let them handle it. The special needs of the twelve Christian universities in China will be handled by the Joint Committee. Someone has already promised to donate two thousand pounds to handle the above-mentioned activities, and promised to continue to donate three thousand pounds, provided that the university staff must contribute the same amount of funds. Cooperation is the key to achieving good results. Oxford University feels obligated to cooperate with other universities and related associations to carry out everything.

<p>Yusuke Tsurumi Worries About International Isolation; Japan's Rear Area Construction is Completely Stalled, Showing That Finances Have Reached the End of the Road</p>
<p>Hong Kong Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese House of Representatives held a general meeting on the 27th, with the most questions focused on diplomacy. First, Yusuke Tsurumi of the Minseito Party, known for his diplomatic views, questioned the notes from Britain, the United States, and France. Tsurumi said that since the views of the three countries are different from Japan's, what methods will the cabinet use to make them understand? Arita replied that he would deal with it with an indomitable spirit. Military warfare requires long-term endurance, and ideological warfare and cultural warfare are also the same. Tsurumi also asked why the US note of December 31 was more lenient than before, and why the cabinet did not make further efforts. Arita replied that after the war is over, he will adopt specific policies to make them understand. From this response, it can be seen that Arita still leaves room for flexibility, and his intention is very clear. Shigeharu Kasai asked if there was a solution to the problems of navigation on the Yangtze River and the rights and interests of various countries in China. Arita replied that Japan is trying to resolve the issues between Japan and the United States and Britain as soon as possible. Kasai also asked if it was true that the army advocated advancing north and the navy advocated advancing south. Hiranuma replied that the army and navy are based on national policy and seek the development of national power, and there is no distinction between advancing south and advancing north. Kasai's words were an indirect question about the friction between the army and navy, and Hiranuma's answer was irrelevant. Seiyukai's Morita asked if failing to fully promote rear area construction would hinder "long-term construction." Hiranuma replied that due to the increase in military spending, rear area construction is inevitably stalled, but we must conserve energy and save other expenses to supplement the needs of rear area construction. From this question and answer, it can be seen that the construction of Japan's rear area has been completely stalled, and there is no more strength for the so-called "long-term construction." Japan's predicament is more than half evident. (Dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Decides to Increase Taxes to Make Up for the Budget and Compel People to Donate Money</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to semi-official news from Tokyo, in order to cope with the huge military expenditure of the war of resistance against Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Finance is now planning to increase tax revenue by 200 million yen to contribute to the special military budget, which will be submitted to the Diet for discussion in January. It is heard that the Japanese government will collect commodity taxes on high-end silk fabrics, silk tea, cocoa, soap, toothpaste, toys, electrical appliances, fruits, leather goods, automobiles, and rice wine. Taverns will also be charged banquet donations. The Ministry of Finance estimates that special profit taxes can be increased by 80 million yuan, company dividend taxes can be collected by 8 million yuan, commodity taxes can be increased by 36 million yuan, public debt interest tax by 1 million yuan, sugar consumption tax by 10 million yuan, non-alcoholic beverage tax by 2 million yuan, housing construction tax by 2 million yuan, and stamp tax by 1 million yuan.

<p>(Paris) The French government has not yet agreed to the Japanese government's intention to appoint Masano Tani as the ambassador to France because Tani made anti-French remarks last July. The French and Japanese governments are currently negotiating. It is heard that if Tani retracts his previous statements, France will agree to his appointment. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo News, Japan sent Tani Masano to France as ambassador, and sought France's consent. The French authorities refused to agree because Tani had publicly attacked France to reporters in Shanghai. Hiranuma and Arita were very embarrassed and convened a cabinet meeting on the 27th to discuss countermeasures. It was heard that it was decided that Arita would deal with it as the situation required, and temporarily dispatched his counselor at the embassy in France to act as chargé d'affaires. The Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying, "France's refusal to agree is very incomprehensible." During the General Assembly of the Noble Academy, Councilor Engutani also raised a question about this, but Arita said, "We are currently paying attention to France's attitude, but there is no intention to replace the ambassador."

<p>(New York) Undersecretary of State Welles, in a speech at the New York Law Society yesterday, declared that the principles and objectives of American foreign policy include the following three points: (1) Expanding military preparations to achieve complete freedom of action at any time and to repel any attacks on the American continent. (2) Strengthening the political and economic relations with the countries of the American continent and countries around the world that can cooperate with the United States. (3) Cooperating with all countries to eliminate trade barriers and restore the principle of trust in international trade. Welles then commented on various important current political issues. First, he said that although the relations between the countries of the Americas have developed smoothly recently, some problems are still waiting to be resolved. Regarding this point, Welles emphasized that the Good Neighbor Policy cannot be effective unilaterally and must be based on reciprocity and mutual trust to be effective. Welles then mentioned the situation in the Far East, stressing that the US government will never recognize that any country has the right to abolish the rights and interests enjoyed by the United States in China under treaties, but is willing to discuss the modification of Far Eastern relations with China, Japan, and other signatory countries at any time. Mentioning the relationship between the United States and totalitarian governments, Welles declared, "We are willing to maintain friendly relations with all the peoples of the world and will never advise any people on the form of government." Finally, Welles solemnly declared that although the United States does not want to be involved in any foreign conflicts, it does not want to adhere to absolute neutrality, because the result of absolute neutrality is tantamount to promoting the ferocity of the aggressor and reducing the strength of the invaded country. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) Undersecretary of State Welles said in a speech at the Law Society last night that in this troubled time for our modern civilization, the greatest goal of the US government's policy is to keep the United States at peace. At the same time, the American people and the government have reserved the power to protest and criticize the cruel and inhumane treatment applied to mankind in the event of any wild event occurring anywhere. The US government has also made it clear that if any foreign diplomatic policy threatens the peace and security of the United States, or if the result will be an infringement of the treaty rights enjoyed by the United States or its citizens, the US government will exercise its power to confront it when necessary. Welles then touched on the Far East issue, saying that the United States is prepared to discuss, in coordination with the countries with direct interests in that part of the world, including both China and Japan, any proposal based on reason and justice aimed at amending or deleting provisions in existing treaties.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has requested Congress to immediately approve an appropriation of US$50 million, most of which will be used to purchase new aircraft related to the government's national defense program, and requested that the funds be allocated immediately so that they can be used in the remaining days of this fiscal year and the fiscal year from July 1 this year. Part of the funds will be used to implement the defense program listed in President Roosevelt's proposal to Congress on January 12 to purchase US$300 million in army aircraft. Of this 50 million, 46,442,000 yuan will be used for the air force program. According to the government, this amount can purchase 565 new fighter planes. In addition, the president also requested 4,490,000 yuan to purchase radio equipment and 67,000 yuan to purchase weapons to be used on the above-mentioned aircraft. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>American-Made Aircraft Supplied to France Attracts Great Attention from All Parties</p>
<p>(Washington) According to rumors from political circles here, Britain, the United States, and France have signed a "secret agreement." This news was leaked when the Senate Armed Services Committee investigated the incident of members of the French Air Force participating in test flights of the latest American bombers, attracting great attention. Of course, this kind of report cannot be confirmed, but well-informed sources believe that this kind of agreement exists. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt announced that American aircraft manufacturers, with the consent of the government, have agreed to supply the French government with an unspecified number of aircraft. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Military Committee has begun reviewing the French purchase of 600 military aircraft from the United States for 65 million US dollars, with the aim of determining whether this purchase agreement contains traces of a Franco-American alliance. At the same time, it is also protecting American military inventions and will investigate whether the Treasury Department has provided France with payment facilities. (American Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) When President Roosevelt received reporters today, one reporter asked whether the US government would provide convenience for France to purchase aircraft from American manufacturers. The President immediately gave a negative answer, but also said that the reasons for the French government to purchase aircraft are very clear. The US State Department, when discussing this matter, had decided to cooperate with it. This kind of cooperation is practically conducive to the advancement of the American aircraft manufacturing program. In other words, the American aircraft manufacturing expansion program has not yet been implemented. The French government's order of new aircraft from American factories can allow these factories to prepare in advance so that they can be more skilled when the Japanese government places orders. For this reason, the government decided to allow France to order aircraft from domestic factories, and at the same time informed the French government that it was a good thing for that country to order aircraft from the United States. Rumors that the government would lend funds to France and that Britain intends to continue ordering aircraft from the United States are not accurate. As for the death of Schmidtlin, a representative of the French Ministry of Aviation, in a bomber test flight accident, this aircraft was originally owned by a private factory, and the US government had never ordered it from the factory. There was nothing strange about Schmidtlin participating in the test flight. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>

However, if a person is selected to form an informal small delegation to Japan, which can discuss matters with Japanese cabinet members on equal terms, but not representing the British government, only expressing the general opinions of the British people, then this trip may not be without benefit. A statesman like Lord Baldwin can serve as the leader of the delegation, and the Sino-Japanese dispute may be restored to peace through this trip. He is very optimistic about this.

<h3 id="e34">Moscow Announces Progress of Soviet-Japanese Fishery Negotiations <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Soviet Reply Upright and Firmly Rejects Japanese Demands; New Agreement Must Be Based on Fishery Auction</p>
<p>Moscow - Regarding the Soviet-Japanese fishery negotiations, after the Soviet Dalrybflot (Far Eastern Fisheries Trust) announced that a fishery auction would be held on March 15th of this year, Japanese Ambassador Togo and Litvinov exchanged several notes and memoranda.</p>
<p>Japanese Note Content</p>
<p>In the Japanese Ambassador's note and memoranda, while acknowledging that the fishery preparation period had already begun, it was deemed inappropriate for the Soviet side to announce an auction while negotiations were still in progress. It was generally recognized that the Soviet government had no right to unilaterally declare an auction, and that the auction allegedly violated Japanese fishing rights, rendering those rights insignificant. The Japanese Ambassador also continued to oppose the Soviet government's proposal to reclaim several fishing grounds from the Japanese side. In his opinion, any change to the current situation and disruption of "stability" would "strike a blow to the special historical circumstances of the Japanese people." The Soviet government's reclamation of such fishing grounds for military reasons, it was argued, turned an economic problem into a political one, and for military reasons, allegedly could not be included in any agreement. The Japanese government could agree to the reclamation of these fishing grounds, but only if an equal number of fishing grounds of equal value were allocated elsewhere to compensate, so that "stability" could be maintained. The Ambassador also reiterated the verbally communicated assertions made in past negotiations, stating that the Soviet government must consider the potential conflicts and consequences.</p>
<p>Soviet Rebuttal</p>
<p>Litvinov's note and memoranda pointed out the contradictions in the Japanese Ambassador's document, the lack of basis for Japanese demands, and firmly stated that "Japanese fishermen have always particularly hoped that the auction dates would be announced in advance, so that they could adequately prepare for the fishing season. The continuation of fishery negotiations does not restrict the Soviet government's freedom of action, because the Soviet government has long explicitly stated that the new agreement must be based on fishery auctions. Auctions of fishing grounds near the Soviet coast, within Soviet territorial waters, and belonging to the Soviet Union can only be unilaterally conducted by the Soviet government, as it is a matter of Soviet government sovereignty. Public and agreed-upon deadlines that have already passed should not be cited as the Japanese Ambassador has done. As for the Treaty of Portsmouth, even its fundamental spirit and wording have undoubtedly been violated by Japan, and there is absolutely no conflict with the principle of auctions. That treaty also does not stipulate that Japan can arbitrarily demand any fishing grounds belonging to the Soviet Union, nor any number of fishing grounds. After that treaty came into effect, the Japanese only managed to operate in over a hundred fishing grounds for many years, while now they can lease over three hundred through auctions. As for the claim that fishing grounds once leased by the Japanese should forever belong to the Japanese, and can only be exchanged for other fishing grounds, that is completely unreasonable.</p>
<p>The Japanese Ambassador's claim that the Soviet government's auction is illegal is entirely arbitrary, without any obligation or reason based on any Soviet promises. The Japanese side must recognize that these fishing grounds are Soviet state property and should be handled by the Soviet government. The Japanese side can only use them based on an agreement with the Soviet government, and their status is only that of lessees. The method of exercising rights by mutual consent in recent years has already passed, and the Soviet government bears no obligation. The continuation or modification of this method can only be decided by the Soviet government's goodwill. At the same time, the Soviet government has no obligations regarding the so-called "historical sentiments of the Japanese people," even if the claim that such sentiments are severely affected by the reduction in the number of fishing grounds is valid.</p>
<p>The Soviet government has absolutely no intention of turning the fishery problem into a political problem, but this does not mean that the Soviet side must ignore the Japanese government's policy towards the Soviet Union and the public declarations of Japanese government officials regarding the aims of that policy, and should not take necessary measures to defend its borders and coasts. Attention to national defense is naturally derived from any public or agreed-upon right of the Soviet government, and is its natural, indisputable, and inviolable right. The Soviet government believes that all demands that do not arise from its own formal obligations but are arbitrarily made cannot be tolerated. As far as the Japanese government's policy towards the Soviet Union is concerned, the Japanese side has no political or moral reason to make demands on the Soviet government beyond the latter's formal obligations. Since the Japanese side has been given the possibility of leasing fishing grounds through auctions, the obligations of the Treaty of Portsmouth have been fully fulfilled. If Japanese fishermen participate in the auction, their interests will be guaranteed to be satisfied to a full extent; if they do not participate in the auction, these interests will be damaged, and all consequences will occur.</p>
<p>As for the intimidation tactics implied in the Japanese Ambassador's words, and more openly stated in Japanese newspapers, they are generally worthless, do not benefit Japanese fishermen in any way, and cannot affect the completely fair attitude of the Soviet government.

<p>Russian Ambassador Clearly States to Britain that It Will Still Abide by Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Obligations</p>
<p>(London) Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax last night. The purpose of the visit was not disclosed. This matter has attracted attention because Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz also met with French Foreign Minister Bonnet last night. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon, informing him of the discussions between British and Italian cabinet members in Rome. Ambassador Maisky explained the trade negotiations to be conducted between the Soviet Union and Germany. Regarding this matter, Soviet sources here said that these negotiations were initiated by Germany. Germany may take the opportunity to inquire about the Soviet Union's attitude if something were to happen in Western Europe in the future. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, will maintain close contact with Poland. Earlier this month, Polish Foreign Minister Beck provided information on the situation in the Soviet Ukrainian Republic when he spoke with German leader Hitler, and told him that it was unlikely that the Ukrainian state could be separated. This was intended to divert Germany's attention to the West, which is commendable. In addition, the current Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty stipulates that the Soviet Union should assist France with military force if Germany attacks France, but if France is invaded by Italy, this mutual assistance treaty will not automatically come into effect. If the member states of the League of Nations can invoke the Covenant at that time, the Soviet Union can still provide assistance to France in accordance with the terms of the Covenant.

<p>Moscow - The report that Schnurre, Director of the Trade Department of the German Foreign Ministry, is coming here has been confirmed by well-informed sources here. It is said that Director Schnurre's trip was initiated by the German side. The purpose of his mission is still unknown. It may be that the country intends to maintain normal relations with Soviet Russia, or even seek to improve bilateral trade relations, to prevent other countries from taking the opportunity to enter. In short, Schnurre's trip at least proves that the Ukrainian issue is not very pressing at the moment. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Warsaw - Polish officials declared that the greatest achievement of the current German-Polish talks was the renewed assurance of the continued validity of the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. In other words, Germany has indicated that it has no intention of making territorial claims on the Polish Corridor or Polish Ukraine. It is said that the main purpose of the German Foreign Minister's visit to Warsaw was to reaffirm and develop the policy of that treaty. The experiment of the past five years has shown its effectiveness, so there is absolutely no reason to draw up a new agreement. Officials also reiterated that Poland opposes the policy of encircling Germany, and Poland does not want to hinder Germany's natural development. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Germany and Italy Will Regret Helping Japan; European War Unlikely to Break Out for the Time Being</p>
<p>Singapore - After traveling through the Far East, French politician and former member of the Daladier cabinet, Fievez, set off for Europe. He declared when passing through Singapore that Germany and Italy, who have not stood alongside other European powers in a common front in the Far East to confront Japan, will surely regret it in the future. Fievez also said that it was a major blow that the German and Italian governments had not understood the need for Europe to take a common front against Japan. However, most German and Italian observers in the Far East believe that Germany and Italy will surely greatly regret their actions in the future. He believes that it is absolutely necessary for the naval, land, and government leaders of French Indochina, the Philippines, and the three Malay states to maintain contact with each other. He expects Europe to maintain peace because he is convinced that Italy does not want to fight, and Germany does not want to fight Britain and France for Italy's sake. Germany will be busy in Central and Eastern Europe for several years, and if Britain and France remain strong, there will be no danger of war in the West. It is noted that Fievez joined the cabinet in 1933-34 when Daladier was Prime Minister, and is now the Secretary-General of the French Radical Party and the Secretary-General of the International Consultation of European Liberal Democratic Parties.

<p>(London) Britain's attitude towards the dictatorships has suddenly become much tougher. On this day when the Spanish war has entered a critical juncture, important officials of the British cabinet have issued warnings, asking the dictatorships not to ignore the strength of the British Empire. According to Naval Minister Stanhope, in 1938, Britain launched an average of more than one warship per week. Therefore, proceeding at this rate, Britain will be able to become the strongest naval power in the world naval race. "At present, no shipbuilding plan in Japan, France, Germany, or Italy can compare with our country in scale. Furthermore, although our current naval power has surpassed all countries, it will be greatly strengthened in the next two or three years." Moreover, Britain's current shipbuilding is unprecedented in British peacetime. "Important warships currently under construction include seven battleships, twenty-one cruisers, twenty-nine destroyers, fifteen submarines, and five aircraft carriers. At the same time, four of the seven battleships are ready to be launched this year." Air Minister Wood also stated that Britain's aircraft production in 1938 has more than doubled compared to the past, and is expected to increase to three times that amount this year. "As for the quality, it is also better than ever before." Home Secretary Hoare also stated the day before yesterday that the position of the British Empire has reached an impregnable level. May ambitious countries not repeat the mistakes of 1914. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Stanhope, the Naval Minister, recently published an article in the "Our Country and Empire" magazine, explaining the situation of British naval shipbuilding. It stated that it is not easy and there is no certainty in comparing our country's naval power with other countries. The best way is to compare the number of capital ships. Japan has a total of nine capital ships, Germany has five, Italy has four, and our country has as many as fifteen. Four newly built capital ships can also be launched within this year. In addition, there are more than four hundred warships of various types, including sixty cruisers, one hundred and sixty-nine destroyers, and fifty-four submarines. In the event of war, many merchant ships and fishing boats can be converted for military use. Our country's naval superiority can be seen from this. It can be asserted that the strength will be even greater in two or three years. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>It is Our Unquestionable Duty to Stop Foreign Aggression; New Positions Established in Northern Catalonia</p>
<p>Gerona City, Northern Spain - Republican Government Prime Minister Negrín recently issued a proclamation to the people, stating that the domestic and foreign enemies of Spain are already at the end of their ropes. In order to struggle for survival, like trapped beasts fighting, they can only take offensive action as a desperate gamble. Thus, they were fortunate enough to succeed in the Battle of Barcelona. Fortunately, the government army is now mobilizing the central main force to the front line, and will be able to contain the impact of the aggressors. As for the supply of military equipment, the government has also overcome the difficulties of the non-intervention policy pursued by various countries and the naval blockade by the rebels, and has obtained a large number of supplies. Although it is somewhat late, it is not too late. The subsequent confrontation will surely reflect the glorious battle of defending the city of Madrid. In short, "We are rich in the spirit of sacrifice and will surely win the final victory." (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Madrid - General Gasa Du, the Deputy Commander of the Republican Army in the Madrid front, published an article here yesterday, saying that the war will not stop for a day as long as Spain needs to ensure that it is not invaded by foreign countries.

<p>(Paris) The Spanish government army issued a war report from Girona City last night, saying that the government army retreated in advance and voluntarily abandoned the city for fear that Barcelona City might be surrounded on all sides. The National Army occupied the city on the 26th. At that time, the city had a total population of 2 million, but most of them were women, children, and the elderly. There are still fierce battles in Solsuna, Turia, Manresa, Sabadell, Mangano and other places. The two sides are at a stalemate. The government army is in high morale and has unified military discipline. They are all determined to defend the new positions. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>

As for the war on the front line, the National Army occupied Badelona and several places in Sabadell today, seizing a lot of military supplies and capturing about 2,000 government soldiers. They are now advancing on three routes. The first route advances from the north of Solosona City towards Livour City, the second route advances from Manresa City towards Vic City, and the third route advances from Sabadell towards Granollers City.

According to news from Spain, the situation in that country has become increasingly complicated, and the government army's northern front seems to have disintegrated. The number of refugees from that country fleeing into France will inevitably increase day by day. The state council had already decided on how to deal with the situation. Foreign Minister Bonnet will also continue to consult with Interior Minister Sarraut.

<p>Perpignan - As the number of Western refugees arriving at the French border is increasing day by day, the French military authorities have taken measures to maintain public order. It is reported that troops have been dispatched to various places along the border, and several air force teams have departed for the border. At the same time, the railway authorities are now trying to transport 4,000 refugees from the border to the interior this afternoon.

<p>Perpignan - The disturbances in the Figueres area are difficult to describe. Officials are looking for office locations, ministers are searching for subordinates, loving mothers are searching for their children along the way, and disaster-stricken children are crying from hunger and cold. It is a tragic scene that is shocking to the eye. The authorities are now making every effort to rectify the situation and prevent refugees from pouring into French territory. Sentries have been deployed along the French-Spanish border. At night, lights are lit along the border to prevent people from crossing the border. In several places along the way, the snow is knee-deep, and laborers are working to clear it. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Several thousand refugees have poured into the French-Spanish border, and the situation is very tense. Yesterday, more than 10,000 refugees arrived in Puigseda, near the French-Spanish border, wanting to cross the border to French territory, but were blocked by the government's army and police guards. The French authorities are deeply afraid of this situation, because the more refugees gather, the harder it is for the guards to resist the strength of the crowd and prevent them from crossing the border in search of safety. The mayor of Bourg-Madame, a city near the French border, recently issued an urgent request to the authorities to mobilize the militia to prevent riots. High-ranking political leaders of the Spanish government, such as the former Governor of Valencia, have taken refuge in France. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>

The Ministry of Labor officially estimates that 8,000 bodies have already been buried. Coffins are currently in short supply. Military officers directing relief efforts say that relief efforts in many places have had to be abandoned because the stench from unburied corpses is a major obstacle to public health. Linares has become the center for conducting relief efforts, and there is also a major relief camp near Concepcion. Residents of the most severely affected areas have been evacuated. The authorities are carrying out disinfection work everywhere. Today, the President and cabinet members went to the disaster area to inspect and direct relief efforts. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance announced today that it has decided to lift the ban on remittances abroad so that public donations to Chilean earthquake victims can be remitted to that country. Regulations on foreign exchange control prohibit remittances abroad. The Japan Chamber of Commerce and the Japan Exporters' Association, which have business relations in Latin America, have jointly donated 15,000 yen, equivalent to 100,000 Chilean pesos. Half of the amount has already been remitted to the Chilean government in cash to provide relief to earthquake victims, and the other half will be used to purchase goods to assist in relief efforts.

<p>(London) The arms fraud case continued its trial yesterday. One of the defendants, Fritwelling, testified that he was of British descent but is now Dutch. He joined his son's company in 1936 as a consultant. He has known Corgan for about 15 years, first meeting him at a racecourse in Belgium, where he was quite famous. He had no dealings with Corgan and only tipped his hat in greeting when they passed each other. He was very angry when his son told him that Lyford's cash of £5,250 had been handed over to Mr. Corgan, with a receipt issued by a Chinese man named Zhou. He told his son that such transactions were never paid in cash and that he should quickly find a way to remedy the situation. Later, his son told him about the "waste" discovered in Marseille. He then visited Zhou and Mr. Corgan. During the meeting, he called them both swindlers. Zhou remained silent, only smiling. The defendant also answered questions from the public prosecutor, saying that he trusted Zhou but not Mr. Corgan. The lawyer said that there was no doubt that Mr. Zhou was a swindler. Willingly said yes, but he did not want to call him an ignoble person. The case was adjourned to the 30th of this month and is expected to end on that day. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Western Newspaper Reports Two Startling Cases Occurring Near Beiping <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Guerrillas Kidnap Italian Postal Director; Regular Chinese Army Destroys Train Between Beiping and Tianjin</p>
<p>Special correspondent for the North-China Daily News, dispatched from Beiping on January 14th. In recent months, Japanese military communiques have been pleased to use the term "mopping-up operations." At Japanese receptions for reporters, one can hear spokespersons reporting on Japanese troops conducting "mopping-up operations" in a certain place. However, the Japanese side had already stated over a year ago that Japanese troops were conducting "mopping-up operations" in that area. Or the locations mentioned by the Japanese are increasingly close to Beiping. Therefore, whether the Japanese use of the term "mopping-up operation" is appropriate has already raised doubts. I believe the term "mopping-up" is not a proper descriptive term; the term "harassment" is closer to the truth. If "mopping-up" means annihilation, then the guerrillas have not been completely wiped out. They are only driven out of one area and immediately reappear in another area. Two recent incidents can prove this point, and these two incidents are even more shocking because they occurred in the suburbs of Beiping. At the beginning of this month, the Japanese side told reporters that the Japanese army had made great victories in the "mopping-up operations" in the mountains since January 5th, and completely annihilated the "bandits." But only three days later, a team of guerrillas dressed in military uniforms came down from those mountains and kidnapped a foreigner on a busy highway with frequent vehicle traffic, very close to the Japanese garrison. The kidnapped person was Mr. Praetti, the Italian postal director of the Beiping Post Office. Mr. Praetti often went to places that the Japanese authorities strongly claimed to be completely peaceful to spend his holidays on Sundays. On January 8th, Mr. Praetti, along with a Russian woman friend and a Chinese chauffeur and cook, took a car to the Ming Tombs. This place is less than 20 miles north of Beiping and about 2 miles from Changpingzhou, a small town with a long-term Japanese garrison. Mr. Praetti and others drove about a mile past the Ming Tombs and parked by the roadside for a meal. In the middle of the meal, a team of armed Chinese in uniforms suddenly appeared and asked Mr. Praetti and others questions. Mr. Praetti and others thought they were local police or militia, so they did not pay much attention. But when the chauffeur told them that his master was Italian, their attitude changed immediately. They tied up Mr. Praetti and others and searched them, flashing that Mr. Praetti was an Italian who was colluding with the enemy country Japan to endanger China, so they had no respect for him. If the chauffeur had said that his master was a citizen of a certain democratic country, they might not have obstructed him, but Mr. Praetti's car also had an Italian flag, so even if the chauffeur had not said this, they might still have recognized it. The team of armed Chinese seemed to have a heated discussion on whether to execute Mr. Praetti, but in the end, they set fire to Mr. Praetti's car and calmly escorted the four people to the mountains in the northwest to interrogate them. The Japanese garrison in Changpingzhou was obviously still sound asleep in the daytime. The next morning, the Italians learned of this matter. The so-called puppet government was helpless about this. Later, a Chinese person went to mediate and paid a ransom. The guerrillas refused to accept counterfeit puppet currency, so what was paid was all legal tender. The Russian woman and the chauffeur were released, but Mr. Praetti and the cook were still detained because this was a political incident and required instructions from Chongqing first. This matter spread throughout Beiping the next day. The Japanese authorities seemed ashamed of this and turned to put great pressure on foreign visitors here, preventing them from telegraphing this matter to other places. The Japanese clearly hoped that Mr. Praetti would be released within a few hours and that this matter could quietly pass without being noticed by the outside world. But unfortunately, as of the time of this manuscript, Mr. Praetti is still detained in the mountains. The second incident, although rarely mentioned in the local newspapers, is even more shocking. At about 6:00 PM on January 11th, about 500 Chinese cavalrymen dressed in military uniforms attacked the railway halfway between Beiping and Tianjin, two miles from Langfang, while the Japanese army had a strong garrison in Langfang. The Chinese army dismantled a very long section of the railway track and set fire to a long line of freight trains loaded with cotton, only retreating the next morning. Railway traffic was suspended for 36 hours. Only one train ran on Thursday, but passengers had to walk across the destroyed railway tracks and change trains at the other end. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese are either indulging in self-deception or have no real ability. But Japanese officials are completely satisfied with pacifying North China. Recently, a Japanese military spokesperson told a foreign reporter that 95% of the "bandits" in eastern Hebei and around Beiping have been "annihilated." The reporter said that the remaining 5% must be extremely active. Judging from the above-mentioned incidents and the unofficial news that has been trickling in from Shanxi and other parts of the interior, the Japanese optimism has no guarantee at all. Unless the Japanese army reinforces a very large number of troops, they will soon discover that the guerrillas are an extremely difficult military problem.</p>

<p>Japanese Special Service Organ Newly Formulates Action Program; Chaoshan and Meixian Counties Plan to Prevent Japanese Side</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Regarding the Chaoshan area, the Japanese army has recently changed to a policy of appeasement. On one hand, they attack China's necessary military measures and alienate official-civilian cooperation. On the other hand, they buy off alienated elements with petty favors, making them the Japanese army's henchmen. It is heard that the Japanese army's special service organ in South China has formulated a political offensive, economic monopoly, action program for the new year. All areas without immediate military action will adopt new methods, starting from the political and economic aspects. Currently, coastal fishermen and unemployed and displaced young people are their targets for enticement and recruitment. The Chaoshan authorities have taken strict precautions, and the police bureau and popular organizations are investigating in all directions, preventing bad people from sneaking in to carry out activities. In mid-January, they successfully cracked down on a sailboat smuggling tungsten ore for export on a boat in Mianhu, Jieyang, intercepting thousands of catties of tungsten ore. Chen Yihou, who poisoned wells in Chao'an, was also arrested and executed by firing squad. It is also heard that the Japanese side has bought off bandits on the Fujian border, organizing the so-called "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," purchasing armed guns and ammunition from the people at high prices, with the intention of reducing the people's self-defense forces. The Chaoshan and Meixian counties have specially formed a joint defense office on the Fujian-Guangdong border. Meijiaoping three counties have set up a joint defense, and Purao three counties have also set up a joint defense. All coastal villages must strictly implement five-family joint guarantees. The Shantou Support Association has specially set up a wartime people's training institute, dividing them into classes for merchants, workers, women, young people, and children, etc., which are responsible for training by various organizations. They have already begun to recruit outstanding members to be sent to work in various organizations, with the aim of mobilizing the people and consolidating their confidence in the War of Resistance. Xingning and other counties have widely established rear hospitals, recruiting military doctors and pharmacists. The wartime work supervision team organized by the Fourth War Zone has now been sent to work in the Chaoshan and Meixian counties, targeting the Japanese side's political offensive program and implementing supervision of the people. Its responsibilities are as follows: (1) Promoting popular armed self-defense; (2) Eliminating traitors; (3) Setting up relay outposts; (4) Forming transportation teams; (5) Forming rescue teams; (6) Maintaining the discipline of the self-defense army. The above new lineup has been started this spring, teaching and organizing at the same time, and consolidating everyone's belief in victory. As for the work of attracting popular support, it is also proceeding step by step. Lin Weimin, the Shantou Party Affairs Commissioner, was prosecuted after being detained for corruption and bending the law. The financial system of the counties is not allowed to be disrupted, and no new donations and taxes may be levied. In the occupied areas such as Nan'ao, field taxes and donations will be exempted for one year to show a refreshing political situation and crush the Japanese conspiracy to sow discord. Coastal fishermen have suffered the most since the War of Resistance, with more than 10,000 casualties, and they will never be tempted by sweet words. Recently, Japanese warships on the sea have again carried out burning and looting of Chaoyang fishing boats, revealing their true colors, which is almost contrary to the so-called policy of appeasement by the Japanese side.</p>

<p>Nanjing Japanese Army Sends Two Major Generals to Yangzhou; Japanese Army Colludes with Local Hoodlums for Their Own Use</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army stationed in Yangzhou has been very panicked recently after news of the activities of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang guerrillas arrived in Yangzhou. A secret emergency meeting was held in Yangzhou on the 7th of this month by Major General Yansong, dispatched by the Nanjing Japanese army for inspection, Commander Ogawa stationed in Yangzhou, and Commander Guiban of Xiannvmiao, Commander Saito of Shaobo, etc. The contents are unknown. The Japanese army headquarters stationed in Yangzhou announced martial law from that day and formed multiple small patrols to be sent to outposts in nearby villages. Also, it is reported that Major General Commander Xintian, who was recently sent to Yangzhou by the Japanese army from Nanjing, accompanied Japanese Commander Ogawa of Yangzhou in two cars, carrying more than 30 Japanese soldiers, to Xiannvmiao to meet with Japanese Commander Guiban, summoning puppet officials and going to various places and Shaobo for inspection for a week before returning to Yangzhou that night. It is also learned that Japanese Major General Yansong came to Yangzhou from Nanjing a few days ago, carrying maps of the six counties of Yangliu Xingtai Gaozhi, intending to sneak into various places to inspect the terrain, and seemed to have ulterior motives. As for the Japanese army inside and outside Yangzhou City, there are only 300 soldiers, 200 puppet troops. There are 500 to 600 Japanese and puppet troops in the Xishan area, and 150 in Xiannvmiao. A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army attacked Sanxingqiao, making contact with the Japanese army. In addition to more than 40 Japanese troops being killed by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they abandoned a lot of military equipment.

<p>Japanese Side Buys Out Bandits to Organize Puppet Pacification Teams</p>
<p>Ogawa, the commander of the Japanese army in Yangzhou, and Tsuchiya, the commander of the Japanese military police, are now colluding with two or three hundred hoodlums and local ruffians in Aozi Street and various places in Guazhou, using the names of the Red Spear Society and the Big Knife Society, using evil arts to fool the villagers. The commander gathered about 300 hoodlums to parade in the city, wearing white cloths on their heads, yellow amulets on their bodies, holding the Japanese flag and the five-color flag, and big knives, etc. The hoodlums acted as accomplices of the tiger, harassing the people. The people could not bear the harassment and automatically joined the guerrillas to participate in killing the enemy and eliminating the local ruffians to protect the good. It is also heard that Ogawa and others have decided to reorganize the Red Spear Society's hoodlums into pacification troops for their own use.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Trains Traitors in Attempt to Lure Chinese Youth</p>

(2) More than 30 students in the first batch of the Japanese language school set up by the Japanese army in Yangzhou graduated at the end of last year and went to various Chinese training classes for training, intending to incite and numb Chinese youth. (3) The Japanese army recently appointed a certain translator of the puppet police bureau as the pseudo "Autonomous Association" in the northwest township, and also appointed Lu Zhengting as the director of the western township pseudo police security bureau. (4) The Xian Shao pseudo "Autonomous Association" is now forcing the people to obtain "good citizen certificates." Various guarantees along the Xian Shao Highway have been forced to obtain them under the power of the Japanese and puppets.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Forcibly Conscripts Laborers to Build the Yangzhou-Tian Road</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Yangzhou is now forcibly conscripting hundreds of laborers to rush to repair the Yuetain Highway, and sending Japanese and puppet soldiers to protect them along the way. Guiban, the Japanese commander in Xiannvmiao, gathered 70 to 80 Japanese and puppet soldiers to search the Santan Temple area at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, but found nothing. The guerrillas are currently very active. Guerrilla activities are taking place near Sanlitan from time to time.</p>
<p>Traitor Wu Xiaohou Commemorates Traitor Yin</p>
<p>Wu Xiaohou, the chief of the Yangzhou puppet police station, gathered all the traitors from various puppet agencies in Zuo Wei yesterday to hold a one-week memorial meeting for Yin Youqiao, the chief of the Lidianzhen puppet police station who was robbed and killed by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army last year.

The county's customs have always been known for their strength, and the anti-Japanese organization has long been completed. This recapture of Wukang is partly due to the small number of Japanese troops in Wukang, and partly due to the active cooperation between the military and the civilians, so it can achieve the effect of using fingers and arms.</p>

<p>—Jiangwan Gentlemen Remotely Honor the Tomb of Unnamed Heroes—</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the seventh anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance. All sectors of the city believe that the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance seven years ago was the beginning of resisting aggression and the starting point of national rejuvenation. Now, the all-out War of Resistance has entered its second phase. Countless loyal and brave soldiers are following in the footsteps of the martyrs of the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance seven years ago, advancing wave upon wave, fighting with their blood for the future of national rejuvenation. The entire country has formed unprecedented unity, and the international situation is also improving daily. The final victory to wash away national humiliation is not far off. All citizens of the city, on this glorious, sacred, and great anniversary of the beginning of the War of Resistance, are in a mournful and solemn atmosphere, with enthusiastic emotions, vowing to gather all their strength to support the national policy of resisting the war and building the nation, and to achieve the goal of national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>City Flies Flags at Half-Mast and Observes Silence to Express Grief</p>
<p>All organs, public groups, companies, businesses, schools, and households in the city all flew flags at half-mast yesterday, with national emblems flying everywhere, creating an enthusiastic atmosphere. They also ate vegetarian food for a day to express their condolences. People from all walks of life also stood in silence at their respective locations at 12 noon for three minutes to express their grief for the war-dead soldiers and martyred compatriots. Various groups sent telegrams to the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the soldiers fighting the war, expressing their condolences and paying their respects.</p>
<p>Shops Participate Enthusiastically in Charity Sales</p>
<p>Various companies and shops in the city held charity sales for one day yesterday to donate money to the government and commemorate the War of Resistance. The time was from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM. All companies and shops were eager to save the country and participated very enthusiastically. The proceeds from the charity sales will be handed over to a major bank in the city this morning and presented to the government. The method is the same as before for donations.</p>
<p>Entertainment Venues Closed for One Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, on the anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance, all entertainment venues in the city, such as Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, amusement parks of various companies, theaters, cinemas, dance halls, etc., voluntarily closed for one day to raise awareness. All Chinese commercial radio stations, such as Dalu, Zhongxi, and Guohua, etc., also stopped broadcasting entertainment programs. All sectors also stopped banquets.</p>
<p>Conserve and Help the Needy, Continue to Donate Money</p>
<p>All sectors are determined to continue the donation campaign to support the government and complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation, to strengthen the forces of resistance. The "One Dollar to Repay Debt" campaign is also being vigorously promoted to strengthen international confidence in aid to China. Furthermore, since the War of Resistance, compatriots in the war zones have been displaced and their situation is miserable. At this severe winter season, rescue cannot be delayed. It is determined to continue to promote conservation to help the needy, collect winter clothes and relief food, and benefit the displaced compatriots.</p>
<p>Public Morale in Concessions Feels Excited</p>
<p>Yesterday's January 28th commemoration, the authorities of the two concessions, in order to prevent accidents, were on strict alert. From early yesterday morning, they had increased the number of detectives patrolling the streets, and anyone suspected was checked. Important sections, such as Edward Road at the junction of the British and French concessions, and Nanjing Road in the central district of the Public Concession, Caojiadu in the western district, and Jessfield Road, were all patrolled by police vehicles back and forth to maintain vigilance. Yesterday, all day, until the reporter filed the report, only patriotic youth were distributing commemorative leaflets on the streets, and no other accidents occurred, which was quite peaceful.</p>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that today (the 28th) police officers and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps are patrolling the streets of the two concessions and stationed at important locations to pay attention to pedestrians) to guard against any possible disturbances regarding the Shanghai War Commemoration Day. Last night, the police stations in the Public Concession conducted a large-scale search and arrested more than 150 suspects. Yesterday afternoon, six hand grenades and ten bullets were found. The investigation is still underway this morning. The hand grenades, etc., were found in a garbage can in a lane on Jiaozhou Road and have been handed over to the Putuo Road Police Station. At 10:00 this morning, a Chinese person picked up a pistol in a pile of garbage next to Wuma Road and handed it over to the Central Police Station.</p>
<p>Jiangwan Gentlemen Remotely Honor the Souls of Heroes</p>
<p>After the January 28th battle, the Jiangwan gentry in Changgouwan, Jiangwan, collected and buried more than 1,300 bodies of war-dead soldiers and civilian victims, naming it the Tomb of Unnamed Heroes, facing the Tomb of Clothes and Hats in Miaohang from afar, which is quite admirable. Every year on the anniversary of January 28th, the Jiangwan Town Office gathers the gentry of the town and has a ritual to pay tribute. This year, due to the pressing environment, the area has long been reduced to a war zone, and the Jiangwan gentry have all taken refuge in the concessions. Therefore, at noon yesterday, a remote sacrifice was held in a certain place, the situation was tragic. In addition, a cement archway was originally built in front of the tomb, with the four characters "Bixue Zhonghun" (Loyal Souls in Scarlet Blood) inscribed on it, personally written by Chairman Lin. Since the fall of Jiangwan, the buildings such as this archway are enough to make people linger.</p>
<p>People from All Walks of Life Comfort Displaced Compatriots</p>
<p>People from all walks of life and some teachers and students of schools in the city, in view of the fact that since the War of Resistance, the displaced compatriots have been away from their homes and have suffered in their lives, especially went to the shelters yesterday to express their condolences and donated food and daily necessities, etc. Yesterday, people also visited the second and sixth International and the Cilian Association central shelters. The Refugee Relief Association, the Citizen Group Fundraising Committee, and the Shanghai International Relief Committee and other charity groups also received a lot of vegetarian and frugality donations yesterday.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Western Shanghai are Generally Fearful</p>
<p>According to people from Western Shanghai, the Japanese troops in Western Shanghai, recently in view of the Chinese guerrillas active in the Hongqiao Road, Zhongshan Road, Qinghu Highway and other areas, and fearing that the guerrillas will launch a large-scale operation on the anniversary of "January 28th", feel that the existing Japanese troops are very weak. Therefore, from yesterday afternoon, more than 50 Japanese soldiers along the Shanghai Middle School on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, the Chengjiaqiao and Hongqiao Airport on the Hongqiao Road, and the Qibao Town on the Caobao Road, with 20 to 30 Japanese soldiers, etc., all retreated eastward to the railway line and the area east of Zhongshan Road before 3:00 PM yesterday, which shows that the Japanese troops are generally afraid of the guerrillas.</p>
<p>The Situation in Pudong is Even More Tense</p>
<p>On the eve of the January 28th Shanghai War Commemoration, the Japanese naval and army forces in Pudong, fearing that the Chinese guerrillas would take action, imposed a de facto curfew in various places during the day the day before yesterday. The situation was very tight in the evening. All land and water traffic was cut off. On the Shangnan side, although the Shangnan train was running with reduced frequency yesterday morning, civilians stayed at home to avoid disasters, so no one took the train. Only Japanese soldiers were seen traveling back and forth on the train, completely entering a state of war. On the Shangchuan side, the Japanese army used Chuansha County and the Gaomiao area in the city as strongholds. The Shangchuan train yesterday morning was also only for Japanese soldiers to ride. Passengers disappeared and the scenery along the road was bleak. Since the area along the railway is only for the Japanese naval and marine corps to defend, because the puppet organs moved to Jiangwan, it is no longer an important place in puppet "politics", so the situation is relatively relaxed.</p>

The Chinese guerrillas in the western suburbs of Shanghai, such as Jiyang Temple, Shihuiyao, Beixinjing, and Hongqiao, all launched operations on the 27th to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the Shanghai War of Resistance and attacked the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. The Japanese troops only guarded their positions and dared not attack. At that time, the Chinese army attacked in three routes: one route went to Xiexu Road in Southern Shanghai, surrounding and attacking the Huangjia Garden in Caohejing, one route attacked the Xin Zhuang Railway Station, destroying more than ten feet of the railway, and retreated at dawn.</p>

<p>Few Business Opportunities for Foreigners; Controlled Exchange Makes Purchasing Difficult</p>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan, owners of the American Asia Insurance Company in this port, have returned to Shanghai after traveling in Manchuria. According to them, many cities in Manchuria have many new buildings and the city situation is good, but the false prosperity subsidized by the "government" cannot be expected to last for a long time. Manchuria's "open door" has indeed been closed. Although the Japanese welcome foreigners to travel there, they only give non-Japanese people very few business opportunities. Manchuria strictly enforces exchange control, making it virtually impossible to send money out of Manchuria. Due to the restriction of foreign exchange, it is extremely difficult to purchase even a small amount of goods from overseas, because foreign exchange forms are very difficult to obtain. Most of Manchuria's import and export trade is with Germany. A member of the Shenyang Club once told Mr. Sullivan that it is very difficult to purchase goods from overseas now. Certain items in the club are deteriorating, and they have not been able to purchase supplements so far. Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan went to Manchuria from Shanghai in late December last year. When they arrived in Dalian, they spent 10 yuan to have their passports approved at the "Foreign Affairs Office" of the puppet Manchukuo. They were repeatedly inspected on the way, and many of the inspectors were White Russians. Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan went from Dalian to Shenyang to Harbin. Although they encountered several days of severe cold, they felt that this trip was quite interesting.</p>

<p>The "Haida", "Hafa", and "Yongzhen" Lose Freedom in Yanghekou</p>
<p>Various Companies Have Reported to the Consular Office for Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>Modern News reported that the Norwegian ship "Haida" of the Shanghai Subei Joint Transport Company, the "Hafa" of the Portuguese Fucheng Company, and the "Yongzhen" of the American Yongli Company, which were traveling to Funing and Hexingzhen in Subei, were loading passengers and cargo. The three ships sailed from Shanghai to Fu successively and arrived in the town the day before yesterday. While they were docking and unloading cargo, Japanese planes suddenly bombed the area. In order to avoid danger, the ships sailed to Yanghekou to escape. Unexpectedly, they were intercepted by the Japanese warships stationed at the port and searched. Bierman, the Norwegian shipowner of the "Haida", reasoned with the Japanese side, but to no avail. According to reports from the shipowners to the various companies, the three ships were forcibly seized by three Japanese warships at about 10 a.m. yesterday and sailed to Qingdao. The authorities of the various ships have reported the situation to the consular office and requested serious negotiations. It is found that in order to manipulate the navigation of the Yangtze River, the Japanese side has repeatedly refused foreign ships to sail. Now, it is illegally obstructing and detaining foreign ships sailing to various ports in the East China Sea, and arbitrarily detaining them. It is extremely contemptuous of the rights and interests of foreign merchants in China. It is heard that foreigners are discussing how to deal with it and hope that the governments of the countries concerned will take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of unfortunate events.</p>

He has made contributions to the country and society and is deeply admired by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Mr. Zhang was nearly 90 years old. Recently, the sound of war drums moved the earth and the Hu cavalry pressed the border, and he came to Shanghai to avoid the war. He was worried about national affairs, and his old age caused him to fall ill and die. It is truly regrettable.</p>

<p>Cannot Underestimate China's Ability to Resist the War; Chinese Nationals Have Strong and Resilient Qualities</p>
<p>Dalu Bao reported that the Japanese-language Dalu Xinbao's editorial yesterday (the 27th) stated that since Japan has made perfect preparations for a long-term war, it only needs to follow the predetermined direction and move towards the road to recovery and prevent the traps set by General Chiang Kai-shek on this road. Britain and the United States provided economic assistance to China at the end of last year, and recently, news of British loans to China, the attitude of the League of Nations, and the joint attitude of Britain, the United States, and France towards China should be regarded as important factors in China's War of Resistance. Japan should do its best to change the views of the third-party powers, because this view can temporarily encourage the anti-Japanese War of Resistance. At the same time, we should not underestimate China's ability to continue a long-term war, nor should we repeatedly declare that China's economy is about to collapse or that the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is weakening. We must remember that Chinese nationals have strong resilience.</p>

<p>The Thrift Relief Committee has remitted the thrift donations received to the Relief Association, totaling 35,000 yuan. It is now heard that the association remitted another 5,000 yuan yesterday, totaling 40,000 yuan. In terms of two yuan providing relief to a refugee, the savings from all sectors have saved 20,000 refugees. The association still hopes that all sectors will continue to work hard and pay on time so that the food supply for the refugees will not be interrupted. In addition, the Shandong Guild Hall and the Jiangyin Fellow Townsmen Association have established fundraising teams. Zhao Pin'an has been appointed as the captain of Shandong, and Xi Rungeng has been appointed as the captain of Jiangyin. Both have reported to the Fellow Townsmen Group for additional appointments. In addition, Xu Xiaochu, the chairman of the Fellow Townsmen Group, has worked very hard for soliciting donations. In addition to soliciting Mr. Ma Bingzhu to donate 450 yuan a few days ago, he also solicited donations of 50 yuan from Mr. Yao Zhiyang's mother yesterday, and sent them to the group's office to issue a receipt.</p>

<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that a member of the Jewish Relief Committee in this port told reporters this morning (the 28th) that he had no knowledge of the news that more than 1,000 Jews had arrived in Shanghai from Italy yesterday. The association is currently taking care of 1,348 refugees. Although the amount of donations received in the past few weeks has increased, funds and housing are two urgent needs. Some refugees have been helped by the association to find various jobs, but the Jewish refugees arriving in Shanghai are not all destitute. For example, the 123 people from Paris carried 10,700 U.S. dollars. A small number of refugees have been sent by the association to other ports where their families may have employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Ministry Promulgates Chongqing Payment Methods; Other Areas to Be Handled in Installments</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's maintenance of credit is consistent. The principal and interest due at the end of this month for the guaranteed unified public bonds will still be paid by the Central Bank, and paid in full in Chongqing. "Permit to Remit Certificates" will be issued in other areas. The National Debt Fund Committee was ordered to notify and comply. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>National Debt Fund Notice of Interest Payment</p>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee issued a notice saying, "In accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, the principal of the sixth decision to redeem the drawn bonds and the interest of the sixth issue of interest coupons for the five types of bonds, namely A, B, C, D, and E, of the 25th Year of the Republic Unified Public Bonds will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications from January 31 of this year. This notice is hereby issued."</p>

In other areas, the Ministry will issue "Permit to Remit Certificates." One-sixth will be issued at the time, and the remaining five-sixths will be withdrawn in five months, one-fifth per month. After the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank was ordered, it has complied with the order of the Ministry.</p>
<p>Full Legal Tender for Redemption of Principal and Payment of Interest</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that after the redemption of principal and payment of interest of public bonds was changed to be paid in full once in Chongqing, it is still legal tender, not remittances. Those who have been issued the "Permit to Remit Certificates" by the Ministry of Finance must be handled in six installments due to restrictions on exchange. However, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of Communications will waive the remittance fee between Chongqing and Shanghai. If the bondholder directly receives the payment in Chongqing, they must pay the remittance fee between Chongqing and Shanghai. It is currently changed to pay the remittance in Shanghai according to the usual practice.</p>
<p>Three Banks Discuss Installment Procedures</p>
<p>After the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications were ordered, they have been discussing the installment payment procedures in Shanghai for days under the principle of Chongqing payment promulgated by the Ministry. All installment payment forms have been printed urgently. It will be paid by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of Communications from January 31. As for the sixth decision to redeem the principal and pay the interest of the Revival Public Bonds, it will be paid from February 28. All methods are exactly the same as the Unified Public Bonds.</p>

<p>Expresses Sympathy by Shaking Hands with Refugee Children, Indicates Optimism for China's Future</p>
<p>Mr. Orcil, the French Consul in Shanghai, concerned about Chinese refugees, having heard that the International Relief Committee's first refugee camp on Route Massenet was well-managed, with remarkable achievements in refugee production and education, visited the camp at 10:00 AM yesterday (28th) accompanied by Mrs. Jordan. They were warmly received and thoroughly introduced to the camp by Director Pan Da, Secretary Lin Chengyi, and Father Mum, among others. Dozens of refugee children, led by the camp's junior teachers, sang vigorous Chinese and French songs to welcome them. The conductor of the singing group was a ten-year-old refugee child. Consul Orcil, witnessing the child's intelligence and liveliness, like that of a famous musician, was deeply moved and felt that China's future was very bright. He shook hands with the refugee children to congratulate them. As primary and secondary schools were on vacation, they only visited various production workshops and observed the sanitation and hygiene conditions. They also purchased educational products made by the refugee children as souvenirs. They bid farewell and left with Mrs. Jordan after 1:00 PM.</p>

<p>Due to Increasing Disconnections for Unpaid Bills, Shanghai Telephone Company No Longer Needs To Implement Expansion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company, to adapt to environmental needs, had planned to add new lines with a six-digit prefix. It is now learned that with the Lunar New Year approaching and under the abnormal development of various businesses, many shops are closing down. The number of disconnections for unpaid telephone bills is highest in the central district. The number of vacant telephone numbers is increasing daily, so the addition of six-digit numbers is no longer urgently needed and seems unnecessary.</p>

<p>Instructed a Certain Chinese to Lobby a News Agency, Domei News Agency Also Exclusively Distributed the News</p>
<p>The English-language Ta Mei Wan Pao reported that recent rumors of Wu Peifu preparing to take a puppet position are rampant. It has now been discovered (28th) that this was actually directed by propagandists. It is understood that any news of Wu from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beiping, or elsewhere directly originates from those directing the propaganda. One prominent example is that on Thursday (26th) afternoon, a certain Chinese visited a news agency in this city. This person was clearly</p>
<p>funded and instructed by the Japanese</p>
<p>He presented a "news" item from "News" in Beiping, stating that Chinese businessmen had telegraphed Wu Peifu, urging him to take the helm of a puppet government to "establish peace and order" in China. The Chinese person said that if the news agency issued this news under its name, he was willing to pay one hundred yuan. Although the news agency refused, a certain English-language morning newspaper in this city actually published it with a local dateline, and even</p>
<p>exaggerated the report,</p>
<p>making it sound absolutely certain. What kind of conditions led the newspaper to do this are unknown. The Domei News Agency widely distributed "important news" about Wu Peifu, but in reality, only the Domei News Agency exclusively issued this news. Other news agencies have not paid attention to it so far. According to a special dispatch from Hong Kong, Japanese sources in that area widely promoted Wu Peifu's taking a puppet position, but other parties have neither obtained this news nor paid attention to it. Furthermore, according to today's Domei News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, the "Chairman" of the puppet "Reform Government" stated that Wu will head the "Pacification Committee" supported by the Japanese.</p>

<p>Shelters Over a Thousand Refugees, Conducts Emergency Relief on Nanao Island</p>
<p>The Shanghai headquarters of the World Red Swastika Society has now received a report from its Hong Kong office stating that since the Guangzhou Incident,</p>
<p>tens of thousands of refugees have gathered</p>
<p>in the area near Hong Kong, sleeping in the open and exposed to the elements, without clothes or food. Their miserable state is unbearable to witness. Emergency relief has been repeatedly conducted, and efforts have been made to assist them in returning home. Reception centers have been established in Yuen Long and Shenzhen, sheltering 1,082 refugees, divided into male and female sections. The facilities include rooms, beds, a dining hall, a school, a reading room, a sports ground, and a clinic. The director of the center, Cai Baotian, is planning to build new buildings in the nearby wilderness to expand the capacity. Furthermore, the relief team sent by the society to Shantou has handled two emergency fire reliefs in the area in the past two months and has departed for Nanao Island to conduct emergency relief. The island is isolated at sea and has suffered repeated disasters. The people are starving and freezing, which is extremely pitiful. Upon receiving the report, the headquarters has collected 1,600 sets of cotton clothing and 1,000 cotton quilts and transported them to Hong Kong for distribution to the reception centers for relief.</p>

<p>All Previously Established Regulations Abolished, Shipping Companies Must Re-register and Re-measure Vessels</p>
<p>—Moufuku and Liangzhou Now Sail Directly to Ningbo—</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the ×th Group Army, to regulate shipping in eastern Zhejiang, convened a shipping conference and revised and amended the temporary navigation regulations for various ports on the Zhejiang East Coast and rivers on the south bank of the Qiantang River. All previously issued navigation regulations have been explicitly abolished. According to the new regulations, direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo is no longer prohibited. Jardine Matheson's Moufuku and Butterfield &amp; Swire's Liangzhou are both scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Ningbo today. Details as follows:</p>
<p>Reissued Revised Navigation Regulations</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the ×th Group Army has reissued revised temporary navigation regulations for various ports on the Zhejiang East Coast and rivers on the north bank of the Qiantang River. Key points are recorded below: (Article 1) To restrict the free movement of various vessels in the various seaports in eastern Zhejiang (such as the Ou River Estuary, Jiang, Jiao River, Feiyun River, Qing River Estuary, Chudu, Yong River, Sanmen Bay, Hangzhou Bay, Xiangshan Port, and various rivers on the south bank of the Qiantang River (such as the Fuchun River, Cao'e River, Puyang River)), these regulations are specifically established. (Article 2) All types of vessels traveling to the various seaports and river mouths mentioned in Article 1 shall comply with the provisions of these regulations. (Article 3) All steamships traveling to the various seaports mentioned in Article 1 must first have their quality inspected by the Wenzhou and Ningbo Shipping Administration Offices directly under the Ministry of Transportation to determine their seaworthiness, obtain a certificate, obtain guarantees from at least two reputable shops in the local area, and register the ship's name, tonnage, route, and duration of travel with the relevant garrison command. The garrison command will then submit the information to the Tenth Group Army Headquarters and the Zhejiang Provincial Government (hereinafter referred to as the Ministry and Government) for joint approval and issuance of a pass before sailing is permitted. Regardless of the port to which the steamship is sailing, the sailing time must be more than one year before approval can be granted; otherwise, sailing is prohibited to indicate restriction. The registration method shall be formulated by each garrison command and submitted to the Ministry and Government for approval and implementation. Steamships that have been approved for navigation in the preceding paragraph must submit a verification certificate and apply to the Wenzhou or Ningbo Shipping Administration Office for re-inspection and measurement within two months of sailing to obtain a certificate before continuing to sail to prevent unscrupulous shipowners from competing and to ensure navigation safety. (Article 4) Foreign vessels applying for a pass to navigate to various ports must strictly comply with Chinese laws and be measured by the Shipping Administration Office in the same way as national vessels. (Article 5) Passenger ticket and freight prices of each steamship must be fair and approved by the various shipping associations and submitted to the garrison command for transmittal to the Ministry and Government for approval and uniform compliance. They must not be raised or lowered at will for competition. (Article 6) (Omitted) (Article 7) Steamships traveling to the various seaports mentioned in Article 1 shall be subject to the following restrictions regarding the loading of passengers and goods (the restrictions are the same as the previously issued regulations, omitted). (Article 8) (Article 9) (Article 10) All (omitted). (Article 11) When each garrison commander directly receives an order from the Military Affairs Commission or the commander-in-chief's office or the Zhejiang Provincial Government ordering the approval of goods or ships for import and export, it must be reported to this headquarters for record. (Article 12) Steamships and sailing ships traveling to various seaports and river mouths that violate the provisions of Articles 3, 4, and 6 of these regulations by sailing without authorization or fail to comply with the restrictions of Articles 7 to 10 shall be detained by the local competent authority or troops, and the circumstances of the violation shall be reported to this headquarters for verification and handling. However, those who load contraband (permitted to be enemy goods) or have communication with the enemy shall have their ships, people, and goods detained and reported to this headquarters for investigation and punishment. (Article 13) If it is deemed that certain types or a certain type of vessel should be prohibited or restricted from navigating to certain ports of entry and exit during certain periods, the commander-in-chief, the highest commander of the provincial defense army, or the provincial military and political department, or the stationed troops must comply and notify the Shipping Administration Office. The same applies when opening. (Article 14) Inspection agencies must be established for all ships entering and exiting the various rivers and seas mentioned in Article 1 to be responsible for thorough inspections. The relevant garrison command or the highest commander of the local defense army (at locations where no garrison command is established) shall verify the local situation and preside over the convening of the relevant agencies to jointly dispatch personnel to organize a (location) Customs Inspection Post, subordinate to the relevant garrison command or the highest commander of the defense army. All officers and soldiers of the inspection post shall be concurrently appointed by the various agencies without additional expenses, but a small amount of office expenses may be granted at discretion. Any personnel who violate the law or are corrupt shall be punished according to military law. (Article 15) If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, the garrison commanders or senior commanders of the river and sea defense forces may submit them to the commander of the war zone for amendment at any time. (Article 16) These regulations shall be implemented after being approved by the commander of the war zone and submitted for approval.</p>
<p>Direct Navigation Between Shanghai and Ningbo Permitted</p>
<p>Regarding Shanghai-Ningbo direct navigation steamships, after the authorities ordered a ban on sailing, various parties repeatedly requested permission without success. Although the Moufuku and other special cargo ships were subsequently allowed to sail to Ningbo, they had to go through Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Wenwan, and were still not allowed to sail directly, which was still inconvenient for passenger and cargo transport between Shanghai and Ningbo. After the Ningbo Fellow Association and others presented their reasons and requested resumption, the ×th Group Army convened a shipping conference and passed a new navigation regulation, which no longer prohibits direct navigation to Shanghai and has been submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for approval. In order to comply with public opinion, the headquarters has already implemented it first, but ordered shipping companies to comply with the regulations and complete registration, measurement, and verification procedures. It is learned that Jardine Matheson's Moufuku and Butterfield &amp; Swire's Liangzhou are both scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Ningbo today. Direct Shanghai-Ningbo navigation, which has been brewing for a long time, has finally been realized from today.</p>

<h3 id="e101">On the Exchange and Transfer System <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yuzhai</p>
<p>The Wrap-Around Discount of Exchange and Transfer</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>The promulgation of China's Negotiable Instruments Law has only occurred in the last ten years. Due to inherited habits and preconceived notions, most of us lack a clear understanding of negotiable instruments, or even harbor doubts and distrust regarding them. Therefore, the application of negotiable instruments in the commercial arena has not yet become widespread. In fact, the evolution of transactions from barter to credit media, from goods and silks to coinage and paper money, is a regular progression. Negotiable instruments are a product of the expansion of paper money credit, and it is only natural to use them as a medium of exchange in place of paper money. In Western countries, negotiable instruments are almost regarded as a necessary tool for transactions, because coinage may sometimes be exhausted, while negotiable instruments can be used freely. With the development of the discount business, turnover is facilitated, and the prosperity of industry and commerce depends on it. China's industry and commerce are backward, and the currency system is chaotic. Government officials are determined to plan for revival, and the currency system reform of November 4, 1935, has been implemented for three years, with remarkable results. However, the application of negotiable instruments has not yet become widespread due to adherence to customs. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the government has launched a full-scale war of resistance, and economic mobilization is an urgent task. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance announced measures to stabilize finance during the emergency period and implemented restrictions on withdrawals and deposits. The local silver and money industry has further formulated supplementary measures in accordance with these measures and submitted them to the Ministry for approval. In addition to the withdrawal and deposit restrictions, payments can be made through inter-bank exchange and transfer, and inter-bank exchange and transfer are limited to commercial payments. Therefore, in the Shanghai market, there are exchange and transfer instruments that can be cashed every other day, becoming exchange and transfer instruments that are not cashed. The industrial and commercial sectors are constrained by the environment and have no choice but to use exchange and transfer as a bargaining chip in transactions. With the widespread use of negotiable instruments, the financial sector has also produced some special phenomena. As we approach New Year's Day, this newspaper is publishing a special economic issue and requesting an article from me. I would like to discuss this topic in depth.</p>
<p>II. Exchange and Transfer Discounts and Speculative Manipulation</p>
<p>Exchange and transfer instruments are a special product of the wartime financial measures in this city. At the beginning of their implementation, there may have been considerable inconvenience. Fortunately, the industrial and commercial sectors have understood the government's painstaking efforts and unanimously supported them. The fact that the financial situation in this city after the war was as stable as a rock and unusually stable was not without reason. The contribution of exchange and transfer instruments to wartime finance is also obvious. However, due to the need for cash in the use of funds in various sectors, it is necessary to exchange cash from the silver and money industry through discount means. Therefore, new institutions specializing in exchange and transfer discounts in the market have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. However, this type of discount, called a discount in the industry, is the same in name but different in reality. According to the general definition of discount in ordinary banking, it is generally explained as the business of a bank calculating the interest between the date of payment and the arrival of the payment date for periodically payable negotiable instruments or securities at a certain interest rate and deducting it from the amount stated on the negotiable instruments or securities, and buying its negotiable instruments or securities at the remaining price. The discount of exchange and transfer instruments is the business of a bank calculating the discount that should be paid for exchange and transfer instruments that cannot be cashed during the emergency period at a certain discount rate and deducting it from the amount stated on the negotiable instruments, and buying its negotiable instruments. This new business had no precedent or established rules at the beginning, and there was a lack of management and control organizations. Therefore, speculators inevitably manipulated it from the middle to seek profit. The industry also competed with each other and kept secrets. The market was not unified, and news was lacking. Deceit and fraud were endless, causing losses to both buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>According to the annual exchange and transfer discount rate, the rise and fall are not necessarily fixed. At the end of last year, the initial rate was as high as over forty per thousand. Later, the situation eased slightly, and it fell to around twenty per thousand. Since the spring and summer of this year, the discount has risen sharply. When Xuzhou fell, it once rose to a peak of seventy-eight yuan per thousand. Fortunately, it soon recovered slightly and hovered between fifty and sixty yuan per thousand. When Hankou and Guangzhou fell one after another, the discount rose again, reaching seventy-one or seventy-two yuan per thousand. During the chaotic market conditions, speculators could manipulate and profit, while the industrial and commercial sectors needed cash, and discounts were not available, resulting in many hidden losses. Recently, large loans from the United States and Britain have been successful. At the same time, the future of the war situation has entered a new stage. People's psychology is stable, and the financial foundation is consolidated. This discount rate has plummeted, once falling to around thirty-seven thousandths, and is currently hovering between forty-two and forty-three, which is a great phenomenon. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Southwest Returning Guest Describes Travel Impressions <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The People of Guizhou Province Possess Extremely Strong Self-Defense Strength, Wang Jingwei Appears in Hanoi on New Year's Day</p>
<p>"Special Interview with This Newspaper" In recent times, the construction and transportation in the southwestern provinces have been developing rapidly. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed Mr. So-and-so, who had just returned from Guilin yesterday. According to his description, his observations along the way were very detailed. The key points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>When departing from Guilin, although Guilin had been bombed by Japanese aircraft several times, the situation there was still very quiet. The first night was spent in Liuzhou. The people in Liuzhou are simple and hardworking. Most of the villages are thatched cottages, but the productivity is very high. The next day, we traveled from Liuzhou to Nanning, which is the former capital of Guangxi Province and is more prosperous. The people also live in tiled houses. The green hills and clear waters are similar to those of Jiangnan. Hotels are priced in Guizhou currency, which is worth half of the national currency. Therefore, a room that costs three or four yuan only costs two yuan in national currency. The next day, we traveled from Nanning to Longzhou, where a supervisory office is set up to handle the issuance of passports for leaving the country. Those traveling from the mainland through Annam must complete this procedure and find a local shopkeeper to guarantee them before a passport can be issued. Near Longzhou is Yazi Shoal, the most dangerous place on the highway in the province. The highway surrounds the top of the mountain. Looking down from the highway, one sees Yazi Shoal, which is thousands of feet deep. A slight carelessness will lead to a fall. The gentleman saw three or four overturned vehicles at this location, probably because the traffic is heavy and accidents are unavoidable.</p>
<p>From Longzhou to Zhennan Pass, we still took a car. Zhennan Pass has a glorious history in the Sino-French War of Liu Yongfu. The terrain of the pass is quite dangerous, but its scale is smaller than that of Juyong Pass. Leaving Zhennan Pass, we entered Annam. The common languages ​​there are Annamese and French. The situation in the countryside is like that in mainland China. That night, we stayed in Dongdang. From Dongdang to Hanoi, there is a railway that can be reached from morning to evening. From Hanoi to Haiphong, the railway is smooth. At Haiphong, there are ships that go directly to Shanghai, and some stop in Hong Kong, which is very convenient. The gentleman also said that there are branches of the China Travel Service in all the places he passed, which is of great help to travelers. The gentleman deeply felt that such a long journey, passing through various places, often staying for several days to investigate local customs, education, construction, and other matters, does not cost much. Regarding the general situation in mainland China, he believes that there is more than enough manpower and material resources. The southwest is indeed China's real treasure, which is not false.</p>
<p>The highway transportation in Guizhou Province is generally open and ready. Almost every place in the province can be reached directly by car. The self-defense strength of the people is very strong. Because of the years of improvement in the province's administrative facilities, agricultural production is quite abundant. Since the completion of the Xianggui Railway, transportation between the province and the mainland has been very convenient. Recently, the Zhennan section of the railway has been extended, from Nanning to Zhennan Pass. It is now gradually nearing completion and will be open to traffic soon. In the future, it will be connected to the Vietnamese railway. This kind of rapid progress in construction will surely bring comfort to the people of the country. In the future, the route between Hanoi and Guilin will be one of the two major routes in southwestern China, along with the route between Hanoi and Kunming.</p>
<p>The gentleman learned about Wang Jingwei's sudden departure from Chongqing and trip to Annam on the way. According to reports, Wang did not have a passport when he first left Chongqing and arrived in Vietnam, so he felt quite embarrassed. Later, he stayed in Liangshan for many days. On New Year's Day of the lunar calendar, he and his entourage appeared in the city of Hanoi, but they were also very cautious. According to what the gentleman heard, the rumor that Wang was staying in a village dozens of miles away from Hanoi was probably a deliberate statement by his subordinates to avoid attention. The environment and scenery of Hanoi are indeed very clear and elegant. The traffic there is very busy recently due to the congestion of passenger and freight transport. When the gentleman was traveling by boat from Haiphong through Guangzhou Bay and Beihai, Japanese planes dropped bombs almost every day. The gentleman landed at Xiying and visited the Chikan area, which is also a gathering place for merchants and very lively.</p>
<h3 id="e103">William Hunt &amp; Co.'s Two Warehouses in Pudong Are Refused to Be Returned by the Japanese <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Nissin Company Took Over the Warehouses Yesterday, Future Negotiations Between the US and Japan Are Worth Watching</p>
<p>William Hunt &amp; Co., an American company, legally should have received the former China Merchants Bureau's four warehouses in Pudong and Hongkou. Recently, it has been learned that the Japanese side disregarded everything. In addition to the two warehouses in Hongkou, which are still used for military purposes, the two warehouses in Pudong were actually handed over to the Japanese Nissin Company for business. What kind of development this international dispute between the United States and Japan will cause in the future is worth watching. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Four Warehouses Occupied After the War</p>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Bureau of Shanghai transferred all its property rights to William Hunt &amp; Co., an American company, for operation after the outbreak of the "August 13th" Shanghai War two years ago. The first step was to take over the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession, which has now been renamed Roosevelt Wharf, and resume business. After the war, most of the wharves of Chinese and foreign merchants upstream and downstream of the Huangpu River have not resumed business due to the situation. Therefore, the business of Roosevelt Wharf is quite developed. However, in addition to Jinliyuan Wharf, the China Merchants Bureau of Shanghai also has the new warehouse in Yangjiadu, Pudong, as well as the Chinese warehouse of Qichang Warehouse, and the Zhong Warehouse and North Warehouse in Hongkou. Because these four locations were in the war zone, they were not taken over during the war and were occupied by the Japanese army after the war and have not been returned.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Refused to Return Them</p>
<p>William Hunt &amp; Co. believes that the purchase of the China Merchants Bureau of Shanghai went through legal procedures with the Ministry of Transportation of the National Government of China and was confirmed by the American Consular Court, obtaining legal property rights. Therefore, it has repeatedly requested the diplomatic authorities of the country to negotiate with the Japanese side according to law, but the request has not been granted on the grounds of military relations. At the beginning of this month, the Japanese army suddenly evacuated the occupied Pei Dongxin Warehouse and Hua Warehouse, and it was rumored that the negotiations between the United States and Japan had a hope of resolution. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side had other plans for this move. It was not until recently that the truth was revealed, that it was planned to hand over the two warehouses to the Japanese Nissin Company for business.</p>
<p>Nissin Took Over Two Warehouses</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nissin Company suddenly sent 24 employees to Yangjiadu Warehouse and Gongchang Warehouse Hua Warehouse to take over the warehouses at the same time, stationing guards in the warehouses. It is also heard that after a short period of reorganization, it is planned to resume the business of the two warehouses. According to internal sources, although the Japanese side is superficially handing over the management to Nissin Company temporarily, Nissin Company is a purely commercial organization and is suspected of infringing on the commerce of other countries. It is also heard that the Zhong Warehouse and North Warehouse in Hongkou will soon be occupied by Nissin Company. However, William Hunt &amp; Co. has not yet heard of any negotiations on this matter. Future disputes are likely to attract attention from China and abroad.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese side controls the inner harbor and occupies various small ports in the Yangtze River, the business of various foreign shipping companies has been greatly affected. In particular, Zhangjiagang in Jiangyin has been blockaded for nearly three months, and passengers and goods have to go through other ports, which is even more inconvenient. Now, the German company Hanvon Trading Company is planning to resume the Zhangjiagang flights and set up a transportation department. The Luan and Haikang vessels will stop there, starting on the first of next month. Small vessels from Wuxi and Changzhou can still arrive directly, making passenger and cargo transportation more convenient than before.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Confirmation of Kidnapping Case on Avenue Haig: Zhao Lianchi Abducted <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Previous Rumors of Shao Lizi Being a Phonetic Misunderstanding; Foreign Newspaper Reports Link to Transportation Matters</p>
<p>News of a kidnapping case that occurred on Avenue Haig a few days ago could not be confirmed immediately by the police at the time due to a lack of supporting evidence. Foreign newspapers reported that the person rumored to be kidnapped was Shao Lizi, but even they could not confirm the identity of the person. Subsequently, Chinese newspapers, citing Chongqing telegrams, stated that Shao Lizi was currently residing safely in Chongqing, which sufficiently proved that the rumors of Shao being kidnapped were completely false. Yesterday, this reporter conducted further investigations and learned that the person kidnapped in this case was Zhao Lianchi, a merchant from Wuxing. It is understood that there may have been a misunderstanding due to the similarity in the phonetic sounds of the names. Details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sudden Arrival of Cars</p>
<p>Around 10:45 AM on the 26th, several black cars suddenly drove to the intersection of Avenue Haig and Dahua Road in the Public Concession and stopped at the entrance of Alley 1004. Many Japanese and Chinese individuals stepped out of the cars one after another and entered the alley, heading directly to No. 3. They pushed open the back door and went upstairs. Two Chinese men remained downstairs to guard the entrance and the staircase. The remaining four Japanese and Chinese individuals went upstairs and entered the room.</p>
<p>Seeking Refuge in Shanghai</p>
<p>The resident of the upper floor living room was Zhao Lianchi, a man from Wuxing, named Zhen, 43 years old. His wife's name was Shen Guiying. His eldest daughter, Ling'e, was 13 years old. His son, Kewei (nicknamed Shunsheng), was currently studying at the nearby Liben Primary School. His elder brother, Liancheng, also resided there. When Zhao was in his hometown, he worked at the Shen Ji Wool Shop in Luduqiao, Wuxing, for many years. His elder brother, Liancheng, worked at the Desheng Wool Shop. After the fall of Wuxing, Zhao led his family to seek refuge in the Xinzhi Town area of western Zhejiang and eventually came to Shanghai. They had just moved into the front building of No. 3, Alley 1004, Avenue Haig, two or three months ago. Subsequently, he had some interactions with colleagues in the wool industry in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Forcibly Taken into a Car</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, his elder brother, Liancheng, had gone to a tea house to chat with friends. Zhao Lianchi was still in bed, not yet awake. Suddenly, unexpected guests came upstairs. His wife was busy working and did not pay attention to the visitors. The visitors entered Zhao's bedroom, took out a pistol, and ordered him to remain silent. They then took Zhao Lianchi downstairs, out of the alley, and drove away quickly in the original car, disappearing without a trace. It is rumored that the kidnapped person is currently being held in Hongkou. However, due to the lack of detailed information, his exact whereabouts remain unclear.</p>
<p>Ambiguous Case Details</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation at the location yesterday, the sub-landlord of No. 2 was a Mr. Wu. The furnishings in Zhao's residence were simple and extremely cramped. After Zhao was taken away, the concierge police officer saw Zhao being driven away in a car with others, but did not know that he had been kidnapped. It was not until the police sent investigators to investigate that they learned the truth. The reason for the kidnapping is currently under investigation by the police. According to his elder brother, Liancheng, they had come to Shanghai to seek refuge because they could not live peacefully in their hometown and he was also unaware of the details of the case.</p>
<p>Reported by Foreign Newspapers</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that a Chinese man named Zhao Lianchi, who was engaged in the transportation business in Shanghai, was taken away by the Japanese on Thursday morning (the 26th). Yesterday (the 27th), the Japanese military authorities inquired about Zhao at the "New Shanghai Hotel" (formerly the Deutches Heim Apartments). It was heard that Zhao lived in an alley opposite Dahua Road on Avenue Haig. On Thursday morning, he was arrested at his residence by two Japanese men and ten Chinese men. It is generally believed that the Japanese did not report this action to the Public Concession Police or carry it out in conjunction with the police. As of last night, the Japanese side had not reported the reason for Zhao's detention to the Public Concession authorities. However, it is generally believed to be related to transportation matters. Until late at night, all efforts to secure Zhao's release had no effect.</p>

<p>Colds and coughs are very common ailments among the Chinese people, especially during periods of rapidly changing weather. Because they usually do not pose an immediate threat to life, everyone considers them minor illnesses that are allowed to heal on their own. In reality, a single spark can start a prairie fire. Various acute infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, often start from ordinary colds and coughs. Consumption, a pulmonary disease, almost always begins with a cough, with the danger being unimaginable. Even if it develops into chronic bronchitis, becoming an elderly cough, asthma with phlegm, the suffering is unspeakable. Therefore, Westerners regard colds and coughs as venomous snakes and beasts. As soon as they start, they are treated immediately for a speedy recovery. Among common medicines, white pine syrup is a natural remedy for coughs. Blue and white pines are abundant in northern Europe. Europeans suffering from lung disease often sit and lie in white pine forests, inhaling their aromatic air, which has remarkable effects. Therefore, it is made into syrup and exported to foreign countries to benefit fellow sufferers. However, pure white pine syrup is not very effective. Wee Ling Pharmacy, especially tailored to the constitution of the Chinese people, combines it with auxiliary ingredients to make a compound white pine syrup that resolves phlegm, relieves coughs, calms spasms, and relieves asthma. It is fragrant and palatable, suitable for both the old and the young. Compared to pure white pine syrup, its effect is many times greater. Those suffering from colds and coughs should not hesitate to quickly purchase Wee Ling Compound White Pine Syrup. The price is one dollar per bottle, with a special price of 75 cents. It is sold at the Zheng Wei Pharmacy at the intersection of Yinghua Street and Second Road. Telephone number 92525. Purchases do not include delivery fees.</p>

<p>Defendant Appears in Court for a One-Sided Debate; Awaiting Judgment; Plaintiff Mistakenly Believes the Court Intends to Reopen the Debate</p>
<p>Wang Caiying, also known as Wang Miaojin, a woman from Anhui who used to perform Shanghai opera at the Tianyun Lou Amusement Park on the rooftop of the Wing On Company, is 28 years old and currently resides at No. 13 Yixing Lane, Qipu Road, Public Concession. Recently, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court's Civil Division against her fiancé, Wu Xianglin, from Ningbo (30 years old, residing at Kangfa Western Tailor Shop, opposite the Empire Cinema on Avenue Joffre, French Concession), seeking a</p>
<p>Dissolution of Engagement</p>
<p>Her complaint stated that the defendant met the plaintiff in the summer of the 25th year of the Republic of China. He claimed to be an inspector at the Jianghai Customs, boasting about his prosperous income and solid family background. He said that he had recently suffered the sorrow of losing his wife, so he often went out to relieve his boredom, hoping to find a suitable partner in a crowded place to complete the marriage mirror. When he saw the plaintiff, he was amazed by her beauty and was extremely attentive, expressing regret for not meeting her sooner. He pursued her relentlessly and was eventually</p>
<p>Deceived by Sweet Words</p>
<p>She was deceived by his tricks and became engaged to him. Fortunately, they agreed to hold the wedding within a year in the 26th year of the Republic of China. Unexpectedly, after the engagement, in less than two months, the defendant changed his attitude. First, he claimed that being a customs inspector was too tiring and he wanted to switch to a job on a ship, demanding that the plaintiff provide him with a 500 tael guarantee, which was not agreed to. He then scolded the plaintiff for being heartless, threatening and insulting her at will. The plaintiff was surprised to see this. Then, he took advantage of the situation and secretly stole the plaintiff's diamond ring. After the plaintiff and her brothers</p>
<p>Intervened</p>
<p>His brother was responsible for returning it. Taking advantage of the plaintiff's absence when she went to Hangzhou to offer incense, he also falsely claimed that the plaintiff had entrusted him to repair a wireless radio, and swindled a six-tube wireless radio worth 200 yuan from the maid. The defendant is so irresponsible and uses such sinister methods that it is difficult to describe them all. As time goes on, it will be unbearable to continue like this. Therefore, she is</p>
<p>Forced</p>
<p>To request that the court grant a judgment to dissolve the engagement. The court, based on the complaint, opened the Civil Court Seven trial yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Wu Xiaoke. The plaintiff did not appear. The defendant appeared in court alone and requested a one-sided debate. He claimed that the plaintiff had scheduled to marry him in the 26th year of the Republic of China. He excused himself that he had bad habits. In the 27th year, he used the war as an excuse for a repeated postponement of the wedding. It was actually the plaintiff's fault. He did not want to dissolve the engagement and</p>
<p>Requested Dismissal</p>
<p>Of the plaintiff's lawsuit. After reviewing the situation, the court granted the defendant's request, held a one-sided debate, and announced the conclusion of the trial, scheduling the judgment for February 2nd. The plaintiff in this case received the court summons on the noon of the 27th. Because the summons did not specify that the party should appear in court, the plaintiff went to the court yesterday without knowing which court the case was being heard in. She waited quietly in the Fourth Court</p>
<p>In the courtroom and waited.</p>
<p>She waited in the fourth courtroom of the second special court</p>
<p>Until the judge of the fourth court finished the trial and left the court. The court clerk saw the plaintiff, Wang Caiying, still sitting quietly in the audience seat and asked what case she was waiting for. Only then did she realize her mistake and went to wait in the seventh court, but the case had already adjourned. Therefore, she went back disappointed. It is heard that the plaintiff intends to file another request with the court to reopen the debate.</p>

<p>Filing a Lawsuit to Terminate Adoption; Adoptive Father Sues the Pimp</p>
<p>The young woman Zhiyun originally belonged to a modest family. Her mother, Chen Ma, gave her to Zhou Quanfu as an adopted daughter. Zhou sent her to a brothel to learn opera. A man named Wang Chengzhi, who liked to indulge in licentious pleasures, met Zhiyun in the brothel. He fell in love with her at first sight, and they eventually became inseparable. However, Zhiyun was restricted and had no freedom. She initially used the excuse of seeking medical treatment and disappeared like a yellow crane. After escaping her prison, she wrote a letter to Zhou, saying that she was unwilling to continue a life of selling laughter and that she was severing all relations and regaining her freedom. She also filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Zhou to terminate the adoption. The court summoned the parties for questioning the day before yesterday and scheduled the judgment for the 30th of this month. However, Zhou believed that Wang Chengzhi was largely responsible for Zhiyun's departure from the family and her subsequent actions. Therefore, he filed a criminal lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Wang for obstructing the family, requesting that he be summoned for interrogation and punishment. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui reopened the trial, but the defendant still did not surrender. Zhiyun was also requested by the plaintiff to be summoned for cross-examination, but she also did not appear. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, Shi Jiutang, in court, the defendant was said to be working in the pseudo-organization "Jiangsu Provincial Government" and his residence was now in the French Concession. Since the plaintiff filed the lawsuit, the defendant had tried to use threats to negotiate a settlement. After Judge Liu briefly questioned the plaintiff, he ordered the trial to be postponed and ordered the defendant to be summoned for interrogation and verification.</p>
<h3 id="e109">German Merchant Ship "Heinrich Jessen" Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Robbed at Zhanghuanggeng <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>2,300 Yuan in Cash Stolen; Passengers, Crew, and Cargo Fortunately Unharmed</p>
<p>The German Far East Shipping Company's "Heinrich Jessen" sails to Xinsheng Port, Zhanghuanggeng, Xinniu Port, Changyinsha, Dongjiegeng, No. 10 Port, and Hupukou, among other places. This time, the ship was carrying grain, cotton, and passengers from Changyinsha to Shanghai. Around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, while sailing on the river near Zhanghuanggeng, it was boarded by pirates with guns on small boats, and all the revenue from the accounts room, passenger fares, and cash carried by passengers were looted by the pirates. Later, the pirates escaped on the small boats. After the pirates left, the ship sailed to Shanghai as usual, arriving safely in Shanghai at 5:10 PM yesterday and docking at Pier No. 4 on the Bund of the Public Concession. According to the crew of the ship, they were robbed by pirates near Zhanghuanggeng at 1:00 AM on the 28th while sailing from Changyinsha to Shanghai. The total amount of cash stolen was 2,300 yuan. Fortunately, the cargo, passengers, and crew were all unharmed. The ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 6:00 AM on the 29th, following its original route as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Rental Ship Dispute: The Issue of Flag Flying Deserves Special Attention <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Case is Complex and Requires Further Investigation; The Court Ordered a Postponement for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Cao Hongyi, the manager of the Yitai Shipping Company, subleased a ship that his company had previously leased from the Minnan Shipping Company, the "Minhang" later renamed "Wanna," flying the Italian flag, and two luggers to the Hankou Shipping Company, established by Luo Wanxiang, the owner of the Dagong Customs Brokerage, for a monthly rent of 11,700 yuan in legal tender. They stipulated a route along the Yangtze River ports. The navigation permit was obtained from the Japanese military by Shi Guangchang, a native of Suzhou and the manager of the Hankou Company, who entrusted the Tianli Shipping Company, jointly owned by Chinese and Japanese shipping merchants. After</p>
<p>Some Disputes Arose</p>
<p>After giving a portion of the rent, Cao, Shi, Wu Chaohua, the former manager of Yitai and a native of Anhui, and Ma Chengbeng, the owner of the Yuantai Xiang Paper Shop on Avenue du Roi Albert, from Ningbo, who guaranteed the Hankou Company with a newly carved seal, and Huang Zhichu, a shipping comprador, were accused by Luo of colluding to defraud 7,000 yuan in cash and 6,700 yuan in checks. The case was reported to the French Concession police, who had already arrested Cao and others and sent them to the First Special District Court. Details of the interrogations have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after Luo Wanxiang,</p>
<p>Accused Cao Hongyi</p>
<p>Of defrauding 4,000 yuan, Zhu Yousong, the mastermind of the Dade Shipping Company. Although their ship rental dispute occurred after the Luo case, it had been settled out of court. The contract between Yitai and Dade to lease the "Wanna" was canceled, and the 4,000 yuan rent was returned, putting an end to the matter. Later, Zhu saw the news reports about Cao and others being sued for fraud and believed that what they had encountered was the same. He decided to join the case, hoping to punish them together. This afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing continued the trial, with both defendants and important witness Mr. Canningham of the Tianli Company</p>
<p>Present for Questioning</p>
<p>According to Mr. Canningham's testimony, Tianli was jointly founded by Chinese and Japanese shipping merchants, and Shi Guangchang was also one of the partners. The Hankou Company wanted to join Tianli after renting the "Wanna" from Yitai, so Shi especially entrusted Tianli to obtain a navigation permit from the Japanese military. Shi had met with Luo Wanxiang and me many times. The court then questioned Shi Guangchang, who testified that he had severed ties with Tianli on November 15th. This time, he entrusted Tianli to obtain the navigation permit, originally intending to pay a handling fee of 5,000 yuan once it was obtained, and another two or three percent of the ship's operating</p>
<p>Surplus</p>
<p>To be paid as compensation. Regarding the issue of flag flying while the ship was sailing, Luo Wanxiang told me that there was no need to fly a flag after entering the Jiangyin blockade line because they had a permit and could pass through. Cao Hongyi's defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, then raised the point that, under the current situation on the Yangtze River, ships must either fly the Japanese flag or the five-color puppet flag, and asked the court to ask Shi and Luo if this was the case. Luo Wanxiang and Shi gave vague answers to these two points. Then, Cao's side presented the "Wanna" shipowner, surnamed Xi, to prove that Cao had handed the ship over to Shi Guangchang and that ships currently sailing on the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Must Fly the Japanese Flag</p>
<p>According to Xi's testimony, the "Wanna" returned to Shanghai from Haimen on December 5th, when Cao notified him to stop sailing because the ship had been rented to the Hankou Company and would be sailing on the Yangtze River. This shipping route is absolutely not allowed to sail unless it is a Japanese ship flying the Japanese flag. Therefore, my diary has a record of the rental to Nikko. In the afternoon, Cao and Shi boarded the ship together, and Cao introduced me to Shi. Because I was unwilling to work for the new owner, I automatically resigned that evening and left the ship. Cao Hongyi then continued to testify that, according to the rental agreement,</p>
<p>The Rent Must Be Paid in Full</p>
<p>Before the ship was handed over. Because of Shi's and Chen Defu of the Gongda Shipping Company’s repeated requests, the 6,700 yuan check would definitely be cashed at noon on the 6th, so he led Shi onto the ship for handover at 1:00 PM that afternoon, with no other procedures. Zhu Yousong, another plaintiff, also described the ship rental dispute between Dade and Cao. However, I thought they were renting the ship to fly the Japanese flag, but Lawyer Jiang presented a letter from Dade to Yitai, providing a strong rebuttal to Zhu's testimony. The court believed that further investigation was still needed and postponed the trial for another hearing.</p>

<p>Approximately 1,000 Homeless; Fires Also Reported in Zhabei and Hongkou</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 28th), a fire broke out in the cluster of shanties in the area of the Western Shanghai extra-settlement roads, one-quarter of a mile from St. John's University, leaving approximately 1,000 people homeless. Fortunately, the prompt work of the Public Concession firefighters prevented the fire from spreading to adjacent buildings. The lookout at the Jing'an Temple Road Fire Brigade immediately notified the fire trucks to dispatch when they saw the fire. After a considerable amount of time, the brigade received an alarm call. The first three fire trucks were dispatched at 12:48 AM. A few minutes later, other fire trucks from the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade and the Yichang Road Fire Brigade were also called out. Two fire trucks from the Caojiadu Fire Brigade also dispatched and rushed to the scene of the fire. Fortunately, the water supply was sufficient and the firefighters were able to spray water around the burning shanties, so they were able to control the fire in about half an hour. After another 45 minutes, it was completely extinguished. At almost the same time as the fire in Western Shanghai, a fire also broke out at a cotton warehouse at No. 152 Ouhua Lane (all transliterations), Yuyang Road, Zhabei. The Hongkou Fire Brigade received a report at 12:41 AM and immediately dispatched fire trucks. However, the fire was already very fierce and took about 90 minutes to extinguish. The cotton warehouse was a two-story building containing a large amount of waste cotton, which was extensively damaged. However, there were no casualties. A rayon factory at No. 63 Huade Road also caught fire this morning. A machine was slightly damaged. The Yangshupu Fire Brigade dispatched fire trucks to the scene at 4:27 AM. The fire had already been extinguished by the factory workers.</p>

<p>Two of the Four Bandits are Gang Leaders; The Remaining Five Bandits are Still in Japanese Hands</p>
<p>The Continental Times reported that yesterday afternoon (the 27th), it was learned from responsible sources that four bandits who were detained in the Japanese Gendarmerie Department on Route Ghisi, escaped on Wednesday evening (the 25th). Two puppet police officers of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" were interrogated the next morning about where they had lingered overnight. Because the answers given by the two puppet police officers were not satisfactory to the Japanese side, they were detained. Today (the 28th),</p>
<p>They Have All Been Jailed</p>
<p>The four bandits who escaped were being held in a row of car compartments behind the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters at No. 92-94 Route Ghisi. Puppet police officers were also stationed at the station to prevent the bandits from escaping, guarded by Japanese soldiers and puppet police officers armed with rifles. Two puppet police officers were stationed near the rear bucket of the car compartment, not far from the French Concession Town where the bandits were captured. However, when the</p>
<p>Four Bandits Escaped</p>
<p>The two puppet police officers were not on duty near the back of the car compartment. When Japanese authorities questioned them about the reason for leaving their posts, the two puppet police officers could not give a satisfactory explanation and were detained. The four bandits are still nowhere to be found. The remaining five bandits, including two men and three women, are still in the hands of the</p>
<p>Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>It is still unknown when they will be handed back to the Public Concession police authorities. Personnel at the police station did not comment on this incident, but it is believed that two of the four escaped bandits were the gang leaders, so the case has actually been reduced in importance. According to reports, the gang was arrested on the 4th of this month in the French Concession Town.</p>

According to reports, Shi Lay Buddhist was well-versed in the classics in his early years and was selected as a talented individual. He was appointed by Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong and Mr. Ma Xiangbo, who was over a hundred years old, and served as the president of the Qiantang Court and the chief prosecutor of Haimen. He was subsequently elected as a member of the First National Assembly, but declined the position, devoting himself to local public welfare for decades, with great achievements. He also delved deeply into medicine, meticulously saving people from serious illnesses, without accepting remuneration. In middle age, he became interested in Taoism, converted to Master Yin Guang, practiced Pure Land Buddhism, studied Mahayana Buddhism, and benefited many people. This summer, he passed away unexpectedly. Friends in Shanghai, in memory of his legacy, have renamed him Gonghui and will hold a Buddhist memorial service. All those who had a close friendship with Shi Lay Buddhist will surely express their condolences.</p>

<p>At the end of 1935, the Lincoln-Zephyr joined the Ford vehicle family. Since its debut, the car has been continuously improved. By 1938, its sales had exceeded those of other cars in the same price range and become the leader. In 1939, a new car was introduced, the Mercury Eight-Cylinder Automobile. The Mercury is a completely new car, positioned between the top-end Ford V8 and the Lincoln-Zephyr. Its engine is larger than the Ford V8, and the frame is thicker. The body size is comparable to the Lincoln-Zephyr, which is known for its spaciousness, but the price is lower, making it sell very well. The seats are also exceptionally large, accommodating many passengers. The visibility is excellent for both front and rear seat passengers. The new Mercury engine has all the proven features of the famous and popular 85-horsepower Ford V8 engine. This car is a pioneer of fashionable style, and its streamlined beauty is enhanced by its outstanding design. The interior is equipped with a new dashboard and a dimmer for the dashboard lights, providing convenience and comfort for the driver. In addition, there is an electric clock and a new "battery meter" (replacing the ammeter) to indicate the voltage level. The steering wheel has a new design and is double-spoke. The car features a new soft seat cushion arrangement. Its excellent insulation and soundproofing are based on complex road and laboratory experiments, making the car very quiet, even when speeding on rough roads. The Mercury is a unique and superior vehicle in the lower-middle price range. It will soon be displayed at the Ford dealership, Meitong Automobile Company. Visitors are welcome.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Gold: Heavy Selling Pressure, Cash Continues to Decline <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Transactions Reach 950 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the cash gold market was slightly calmer, with a range of only three yuan throughout the day, but prices continued to trend weaker. This was because a certain silver shop suddenly released a large number of long positions on behalf of local clients, and other silver shops were also eager to sell. In addition, northern shops and cash houses successively sold, causing supply to exceed demand despite purchases by Tianjin shops, securities firms, and gold shops. As a result, prices fell by three yuan, and market sentiment remained weak. Transactions were still active, reaching 950 taels. Silver ornaments also fell by one yuan. Customs gold remained unchanged. Chinese and English pure gold rebounded.</p>
<p>Supply Exceeds Demand in the Cash Gold Market</p>
<p>In the morning, the initial asking price for the first transaction (ten taels) was 2,025-2,026 yuan. At that time, silver shops suddenly started to sell, causing the price to gradually decrease. It was not until 9:45 AM that silver shops traded 50 taels at the opening price of 1,021 yuan. Subsequently, the same silver shops sold 50 taels to a money exchange business, and a cash house sold 50 taels to a securities firm. Later, news spread that the foreign exchange market was tightening due to aggressive buying by the North China United Bank, and a certain money exchange business suddenly bought a large amount on behalf of Tianjin shops. Fortunately, the selling intentions of a certain silver shop (acting on behalf of local wealthy long positions), clients, and cash houses were still good, so the rise was limited. A certain money exchange business bought 50 taels from silver shops at 22 yuan, and another 50 taels from clients at 23.5 yuan. Another money exchange business bought 50 taels from silver shops at 24 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 50 taels from silver shops, and a gold shop sold 50 taels to silver shops, both at 23 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 90 taels from silver shops, and a cash house bought 100 taels, all at the same price. A money exchange business sold 50 taels to a peer, and a client sold 50 taels to a securities firm, both at 23 yuan for the noon closing price. In the afternoon, a money exchange business first sold 50 taels to a gold shop at 23 yuan, and then a gold shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange business at 24 yuan. After that, prices fell due to hesitation from buyers. Money exchange businesses traded 50 taels at 21 yuan. Later, there were still sellers at 21 yuan, but there were very few buyers, with some only offering 18-19 yuan. Therefore, despite the opening, the evening closing price was still 2,021 yuan, a decrease of three yuan compared to the previous day. The current selling price of Xian Yuhao's brand gold is 2,030 yuan, and the buying price is 2,015 yuan. The current standard gold price is 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there are no open transactions.</p>
<p>Silver Ornament Prices Followed Down by One Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of silver jewelry was unchanged, but at 10:00 AM, as the price of gold approached the 20 yuan mark, the price was lowered by one yuan. Datonghang and Laoqingyun changed their prices to 205 yuan, and Xintonghang set their price at 203 yuan, buying in at 197 yuan.</p>
<p>English Pure Gold Rebounds by Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, 27th: The price of English pure gold rebounded by half a penny to seven pounds, eight shillings, and eight and a half pence per ounce. The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold also rose to 1,214 yuan. The listed price of customs gold remained unchanged at one yuan, three jiao, nine fen, and nine li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by four jiao to approximately 1,209 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Foreign Currency Transactions Scarce <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, English pure gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rates between British and American currencies remained unchanged. The North China Puppet Bank slightly purchased foreign exchange, and there were slight sales of Hong Kong dollars. The process was stable. Gold transactions were not active, and supply and demand were relatively balanced. The trend was slightly soft. Foreign currency transactions were scarce. Market prices continued to decline slightly due to stable foreign exchange rates and slightly loosened gold prices. There were no transactions in the guild. Yesterday's market prices: English gold notes decreased by two fen, American gold pounds decreased by five fen, American gold notes decreased by half a fen, Hong Kong notes and French franc notes each decreased by one li, Annam notes decreased by three fen, Canadian notes decreased by one fen, and Philippine pesos increased by two fen.

<h3 id="e128">Foreign Exchange Becomes More Stable <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>"Lian Yin" Still Operating Secretly; Speculators Not Responding</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday was driven by the "North China United Reserve Bank," which again entrusted a small number of banks in the city to buy in, causing the underlying trend to tighten briefly. The tightest price for English gold was 8.3125 pence, and the softest price for American dollars was 16.21875 yuan. However, since Chinese and Western speculators did not respond, and Western firm Sassoon and others subsequently sold, the situation became more stable. Transactions were very smooth. Hong Kong exchange rates remained tight due to the strong buying interest of foreign banks and the unwillingness of money exchange businesses to supply.</p>
<p>Initially, London's short-term and long-term interest rates for large bars of silver continued to shrink, New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London gold rebounded by half a penny. The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar remained unchanged, the exchange rate against the French franc rose by 7 centimes, and the exchange rate against Shanghai was flat. The exchange rate between the dollar and the pound also remained unchanged, the exchange rate against the French franc fell by 0.125, and the exchange rate against Shanghai remained the same. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened early with a buying price of 8.34375 pence for English exchange and 16.25 yuan for American exchange, both flat compared to the previous closing price. After opening, a foreign company first sold English gold at 8.40625 pence, and the bank bought it at a bargain, so there was no change. HSBC's listed price was unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was down slightly by one cent. Subsequently, the "North China Reserve Bank" suddenly started buying English gold at 8.3125 pence and American exchange at 16.121875 yuan, and the bank refused to buy at a lower price, causing the underlying trend to tighten. However, Western firm Sassoon and American banks soon started selling English gold at 8.34375 pence and American exchange at 16.25 yuan, and foreign companies and the North China Puppet Bank's buying interest was not strong, so the situation turned flat. Foreign companies could settle American dollars at 16.25 yuan. Transactions were quiet near noon, with only money exchange businesses selling Hong Kong exchange at 55.625 yuan to Chinese-Italian, Dutch, and Chase banks. The selling price of English and American exchange rates at noon was the same as the opening price in the morning. Hong Kong exchange rates were tight by 0.375 after the settlement.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Securities: Foreign Bonds Weak, Domestic Bonds Closed <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>London, 27th (Friday): The listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds remained weak. All types of bonds guaranteed by upper-tier customs duties also continued to fall, while lower-tier railway bonds remained unchanged. The pound-denominated British German loan bonds continued to fall by 2 pounds to 70 pounds. The pound-denominated British good faith bonds continued to fall by half a pound to 46.5 pounds, both falling to the lowest prices of the month. The French-American five-percent dollar-denominated bonds with Indian bonds also continued to fall by half a pound to 68 pounds. However, the buying price in the market increased by 7 shillings and 6 pence to 68 pounds, 7 shillings, and 6 pence. The buying price for British good faith bonds with French printed bonds was 43 pounds and 15 shillings, and the selling price was 44 pounds and 15 shillings. The physical supply in London included 1,000 pounds of original Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds, sold at 16 pounds at par, and 3,500 pounds of Kowloon-Canton Railway bonds, sold at 18 pounds, 7 shillings, and 6 pence, a decrease of 2 shillings and 6 pence compared to yesterday's trading and prices.</p>
<p>Shanghai public bonds were closed yesterday in commemoration of the January 28th Shanghai Incident.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Friday): The listed prices of British Far East company stocks still only showed slight fluctuations in Jardine Matheson shares and Kailan Mining Administration shares. Jardine Matheson Bank shares rebounded by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 8 pounds and 15 shillings. Kailan Mining Administration bearer shares continued to fall by 6 pence to 15 shillings and 6 pence.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Silk and Tea: Both Chinese and Foreign Silk Sales Difficult <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>After the sharp drop the day before, the foreign silk market stabilized yesterday. Except for Japanese silk 83 in New York, which continued to fall by 1 cent, and in Lyon, which continued to fall by 1.50 francs, other market prices, including the prices on Japanese and American exchanges, rebounded slightly. New York's near-term prices rose by 2 cents, long-term prices rose by 1 cent, Yokohama spot prices and long-term prices each rose by 13 yuan. However, Japanese and American transactions were very scarce, with only three lots traded throughout the day in New York, totaling 30 bales. It can be seen that the export silk market may not see smooth movement immediately.</p>
<p>In the local silk market, the limited price for foreign white factory 78 silk was 1,360 yuan, but the asking price was still 30 yuan higher, resulting in no transactions. Users' silk prices did not soften yesterday, so silk transactions were also difficult to continue smoothly. Transactions with Indian and African Zhuangkou were also quieter yesterday. If Japanese and American silk prices can maintain a stable appearance next week, both domestic and foreign silk markets in this city can return to normal. If cocoon prices skyrocket this week and domestic sales suddenly flourish, it will trap the foreign silk market in a stalemate, which is not a healthy state for the silk market.</p>

<p>The Short Position in January Japanese Yarn is About to Settle</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current yarn market was closed, but there were slight transactions on the customer side. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 401 yuan, and the Tiannv warehouse receipt was 394-4.5 yuan. It is said that Shenxin Factory opened a huge quantity of 4,000 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn at 395 yuan, with a deposit of 40 yuan per bale. According to a certain source, the short position in the January baseball trading in the Japanese yarn market is about 1,600 bales. The market opens tomorrow, and it is likely that the settlement method will be used.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Grains: Flour Sales Gradually Decrease, Wheat Supply Limited <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Because a large household in North China purchased and sold more than 100,000 bags of flour for several days, the flour stock of various factories has decreased. Customer sales are still active. Yesterday was the 128th anniversary, and large households in North China have reduced their purchases. Small amounts of flour sold by Fuyang shops are doing well. Factories are also limiting supply. The street sold 7,000-8,000 bags, and both northern and southern shops each sold 15,000-16,000 bags. All brands of No. 2 flour are at the original price of 4.8 yuan. Only 2,000-3,000 bags of by-product flour were traded. The market is quite stable. Yesterday, 7,500 bags were shipped to Yantai and 4,000 bags to Shantou, and 2,000 bags of bran.</p>
<p>Wheat: The supply is limited, and the market is difficult to rise or fall. Factories are planning to suppress the price of livestock feed, and lenders are unwilling to loosen their grip. The total transaction volume for the day was only 3,000 bags. Except for Fufeng Factory, which purchased one-third, the rest were purchased by Fuxin Factory. Prices have not changed significantly for the time being. It is reported that recently, several batches of wheat directly purchased by factories from the production area have also arrived.</p>
<h3 id="e135">High-Grade Ke Xian Rice Still Stalling, Medium-Grade Continues to Decline <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Ke Xian Rice: Both arrivals and sales were low yesterday. Yesterday, 860 bags arrived from Hupu, and only more than 400 bags of Wuhu Ke Xian rice and others were sold in the street. Nanjing Xian rice: Because the owners were unwilling to follow the market decline, they held on and did not sell. The top grade of Jing Xian rice still shouted high to 11 yuan, but buyers could not get it for less than 10.08 yuan. High-grade Wuhu Xian rice also firmly held the price of 10.05-0.06 yuan. However, at present, both customer and speculative storage are stagnant, relying only on street sales. Although high-grade goods can stand firm, medium-grade and below are affected by the street's devaluation for sale, and finally continued to decline by some margin.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Rice Shows a Downward Trend <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of domestic rice: 6,000 bags of Hexia and Che Lun Baozi rice arrived. Sales were due to the approaching end of the year, and the warehouse was full. Rice shops also have thick inventory, so speculators are waiting and watching. Except for those who need sales, there are few inquiries in the street. As a result, the market feels more fatigued, showing a downward trend. As a result, the transaction volume of various goods was limited. Both thick and thin round-grain rice fell by 1-2 jiao. Duyang Jiantou and Butou rice also fell by some margin. The price of Yuan Rice is expensive and also affected by the round-grain rice market, down by 2-3 jiao.</p>

<p>Soybean cake had once softened in price due to being undersold by Jiangbei small soybean cake, but the potential of other cakes remains tight and strong. In this extraordinary period, situations vary. Yesterday, Shantou and Xinghua made quite urgent purchases, so although there is a significant arrival of Jiangbei small soybean cake in stock, its market price is also stable. A total of 50,000 pieces of Jiangbei small soybean cake were opened, priced at 5 jiao 7 fen original plate; 1,000 pieces of Dayou Yu Factory's "Four Brands" cake, priced at 3 yuan 1 jiao 9 fen; 1,300-plus pieces of Changzhou Xiefeng Factory's "Four Brands Yuanlong" cake, priced at 3 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen (outside the concession); and 1,500-plus pieces of Changzhou Puhe Factory's "Four Brands Feizi" cake, priced at 3 yuan 1 jiao 8 fen 5 li.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,500 pieces of crude oil were shipped to Ningbo, and 300 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>5,000 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Shantou.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Dutch coarse white sugar plummeted due to a telegram from Java. 500 tons of printed packaging were transacted at 4 guilders 925 Dutch currency. Trading firms are still trying to sell, and the trend has suddenly weakened. Therefore, the guild's quoted price for re-export goods plummeted by 4 jiao. Initially, over 100 bags were traded at 16 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen, but later, even at 16 yuan 4 jiao, there were few buyers, indicating that the market may need to soften further. Domestic sugar also saw little change. Only Guangdong opened a batch of "pian qing," priced at 11 yuan 8 jiao. Yesterday, 1,600 bags were shipped to Duobo.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Metals: White Lead Sheets, Extreme Stillness Arousing Movement <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Army moved west, white lead sheets have been unable to be exported due to customs restrictions, resulting in a plummet in market conditions. Because local battery factories have ceased operations, actual sales have been sluggish, and the market has not been inquired about for as long as eighteen months. Recently, however, the old view has changed, and the market has turned from stillness to movement. More people in the market are inquiring and handling transactions. Although prices have not yet rebounded, in this period of tight foreign exchange, various markets have been able to stand firm and not fall. Currently, grade 2 is selling at 225 yuan per barrel, grade 3 at 230 yuan, grade 4 at 215 yuan, grade 5 at 210 yuan, grade 6 at 200 yuan, grades 7 and 8 at 188 yuan, grade 9 at 220 yuan, and grade 10 at 225 yuan. Thick floral patterns are priced between 205 yuan and 225 yuan, varying. Yesterday, 70 to 80 barrels were traded, acquired by groups from Tianjin, Qingdao, and local battery factories. However, the base inventory is unusually thin, and sentiment is remarkably firm. Therefore, there is optimism about the market, and overseas pricing has recently reached around 25 pounds, suggesting that there will be no sign of a return to weakness in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e141">How to Study Current Events? <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>Living in this great era, the changing global landscape and the evolution of the Sino-Japanese war are inextricably linked to us. Therefore, it is necessary for children to study current events.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<p>First, one must have a very basic understanding of geography and history. Ideally, one should read biographies of famous contemporary figures to easily understand news reports. Also, a map is an essential tool for studying current events. If it's a large map, it can be hung on the wall with small colored paper triangles attached to pins, marking areas of interest. This way, the next day, one won't be clueless and can follow events on the map. If it's a book of maps, flip through it to understand the location and relationships of places.</p>
<p>Second, one should understand the background of newspapers and news agencies, as every piece of news speaks for its "owner," inevitably exaggerating or concealing facts. If children don't understand this background, they can easily be deceived. For example, most large newspapers in Shanghai are run by British and American commercial companies, so their opinions naturally favor our country in the war of resistance. Other news agencies include Reuters (British), Domei (Japanese), TASS (Soviet), Associated Press (American), Hutung (German), and Central News Agency (Chinese). We must also know this to avoid being poisoned by counter-propaganda and gain an accurate understanding of the current situation.</p>
<p>Third, it's best to connect with classmates or neighbors with similar interests and form a "Current Events Study Group" or "Current Events Discussion Group." Set one or two central topics each week, hold regular meetings, and invite teachers or parents with expertise in current events to attend and guide the discussions. Each person can present their research findings or opinions for discussion, and the guide can correct any errors. This not only saves time but also gathers collective wisdom.</p>
<p>Fourth, keep a notebook to record important daily events. Once a problem is resolved, provide a concise summary. Also, keep an old, unused book and paste important telegrams, documents, etc., from newspapers to it for future reference.</p>
<p>Children, if you find the above helpful, try doing it. If you encounter any problems, difficulties, or need supplements in practice, we can discuss them later!</p>
<h3 id="e142">Becoming a Little Radio Enthusiast <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Ren</p>
<p>To the children!</p>
<p>Dear children! Have you all seen a radio? I believe you have. So, I ask you, do you find it amazing? How can a small square box sing softly when plugged into electricity?</p>
<p>Children, don't be surprised. This is science. If you understand its principles, you can understand why it makes sound.</p>
<p>However, these principles are very deep, and even adults sometimes don't understand them clearly. We are still young, so understanding how to build one is enough. As we become more familiar with it, we will naturally understand its principles.</p>
<p>Children, I don't know if you like doing this? If you do, please read quietly. The story inside is very interesting, and I think you will definitely like it.</p>
<p>Okay, please listen to the story quietly!</p>
<p>(1) Wang Min and His Cousin</p>
<p>Wang Min is a sixth-grader at Guoqun Elementary School. He is very diligent in his studies, especially in natural science, always scoring 100 points. Therefore, he is praised by teachers and classmates as "Wang Min is a good student!"</p>
<p>Wang Min's father is an employee at a bank with a high monthly income. Therefore, he always gives Wang Min some money each month. However, Wang Min doesn't waste the money, nor does he buy snacks, because he knows that unhealthy snacks are harmful to the stomach. So what does he do with the money? He saves it little by little to build a radio.</p>
<p>His interest in radio began last summer. He had just finished fourth grade. Of course, he knew nothing about radio, but coincidentally, he had a cousin studying in Nanjing who came to stay at his house in Shanghai during summer vacation.</p>
<p>His cousin was very knowledgeable about radio. He could build a four-tube radio by himself, as well as a receiver and transmitter. Do you know what a receiver and transmitter are, children? They are the machines we usually see in radio stations used for sending telegrams, which are very difficult to make.</p>
<p>However, Wang Min didn't quite believe it at first. "Can he really build a radio?" He often said this.</p>
<p>Once, Wang Min even asked his cousin, "Brother, can you really build a radio?" But his cousin didn't answer, just smiled. This made him even more suspicious.</p>
<p>It was on the fourth day after his cousin arrived—a hot afternoon. Wang Min's aunt went to visit relatives, and even the nanny went with her. Only he and his cousin were at home.</p>
<p>His cousin took out many things from a suitcase. Some were square, some were round, some were flat, some were long, and some were sheets. There were all sorts of shapes, but Wang Min didn't know their names.</p>
<p>Curious, he picked up a square thing with sheets of tin on it, turning it over and over, looking at it for almost five minutes without understanding what it was. He then curiously grabbed the handle and twisted it forcefully, and the sheets of tin started to rotate. This surprised him, and he couldn't help but ask his cousin, "Brother, what is this?"</p>

<h3 id="e144">Small Book Stalls <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Kang</p>
<p>Dear children, do you see small book stalls on the roadside when you go home from school every day? I think children must have seen them, and they must have gone to see the small books at the stalls.</p>
<p>The books at the stalls are very cheap. You can borrow a book for only one or three copper coins. But the children who read books at the stalls are mostly children from poor families who are not clean. If you sit on the same bench with them, you will definitely get contagious diseases. My friend's younger brother also likes to read books. He always goes to the book stall to read after school every day. Unexpectedly, he recently developed a contagious disease. He hired a doctor, who said, "This is a very contagious disease. It's best to pay attention to his diet (which means no fish or meat)." And the school doesn't allow him to study. He is very miserable. It has been a month, and the disease has not fully healed. Think about it, children, is it worth getting a contagious disease for one copper coin to read a book?</p>
<p>So from today on, children, don't go to the book stalls to read anymore. Besides, the books at the stalls are meaningless. They will hurt your brains. If you must read, then go to various bookstores on Sundays and look at the books. Buy a few books that you like and read them. Children should never read the books at the stalls.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Clipper Ship, Creating a New Epoch in Transportation History between China and the United States <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>The Republic of China and the United States of America are neighbors across the vast Pacific Ocean. Although these two republics are located on opposite sides of the Pacific, they are friends across the ocean. They have considerable relations in politics, economics, and culture!</p>
<p>In the past, traveling from China to the United States or from the United States to China relied on water transportation. Ordinary mail ships took about fifteen days, and the fastest took ten days. Cargo ships took more than twenty days! But since Pan American Airways established the trans-Pacific Sino-American air route, traveling from the United States to China takes only six long-distance flights, setting a new record. The relationship between the two countries has become closer. The travel time for diplomatic officials, famous figures, tourists, and the transportation of mail and goods can be shortened. The distant ocean is now as close as in front of our eyes. We must give credit to the application of 20th-century scientific inventions in the transportation industry for this success!</p>
<p>"Flying Clipper" is the Chinese translation of "Clipper" (meaning speedboat). It is the name of the large flying boats used by Pan American Airways for long-distance flights. The Hawaii, Philippines, and China Clippers were ordered from the Martin Aircraft Factory. These Martin-style flying boats weigh 25.5 tons. The upper wing is 130 feet long, and the lower wing (water surface wing) is quite short. Each side can store 790 gallons of gasoline. In addition to serving as fuel tanks, the lower wing also has the function of a pontoon, helping to stabilize the boat on the water. The boat has four engines, each with 1,000 horsepower. These four engines are installed on the upper wing, two on each side. The flight speed can reach 165 miles per hour. Each flying boat can carry seven crew members, thirty passengers, and mail and goods. It takes only forty to fifty seconds to take off when heavily loaded. The flying altitude is usually around 8,000 feet, but it can be as high as 13,000 feet or as low as 1,000 feet above the sea.</p>
<p>Pan American Airways initially used the Pan American Clipper (18 tons) for trial flights. After more than twenty trial flights between the Pacific islands, the China Clipper flew from the United States to Manila on November 22, 1935. This route officially opened on October 21, 1936. On April 28, 1937, the Hong Kong Clipper picked up mail from the United States carried by the China Clipper in Manila and flew to Macau and then to Hong Kong. The mail was then transported to Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes. This marked the completion of the first official Sino-American air route. However, since the outbreak of the war, Pan American Airways has continued to use Manila as the terminal in the Far East. This air route runs from San Francisco in the United States through Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, Manila, and Hong Kong, with a total length of over 8,600 miles. Each station along the route is equipped with telecommunications, weather forecasting, lodging, fuel, auxiliary equipment, and mechanical repair facilities. Pan American Airways has done everything possible for this route! However, since last year, the Samoa Clipper crashed in January, and the Hawaii Clipper disappeared at the end of July. Pan American Airways has suffered considerable losses, but they are still working hard to keep the Pacific air route running. This progressive spirit of service is very admirable!</p>
<p>Children, are you interested in this long-distance flight that spans the Pacific Ocean and connects Asia and America?!</p>

<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—The Diary of Ming'er's Escape, Episode Eleven—</p>
<p>On the second afternoon of sailing on this small river, the boatmen tried their best to hurry on, planning to reach Hangzhou that evening, but time did not permit. Ming'er's father had told the boatmen that they must spend the night near a small town, which was safer. What would happen if they rested in a deserted village near the wilderness and encountered misfortune? No one would hear their shouts. But today there was no way to reach Hangzhou, and there was no small town nearby. At the same time, it was getting dark, so the boatmen lost their direction and had to stop near the shore. Ming'er's father anxiously asked the boatman, "Is this place okay?" The boatman answered vaguely, "It's okay." Ming'er stuck his head out of the cabin and looked outside. It was a vast wilderness with no sound, no people, and no light. It was pitch black, with only one or two large trees scattered around, gloomy, which made Ming'er's hairs stand on end. He was filled with terror and thought secretly, "What if some robbers came at night, with fierce faces, rough hands, and bright knives..." The more he thought about it, the more afraid he became.</p>
<p>That night, the sky was covered with black clouds, with no stars, no moon, and no light. The three small boats hid in the depths of a clump of reeds, lying quietly. From a distance, they looked like three small fireflies, flickering in the reeds. Ming'er's heart was still beating fast, and the family members all lay down with their heads tucked in. Ming'er sat on the hard boards of the boat, worrying about the unfortunate encounter that might happen that night. How could he fall asleep? It was not comfortable to put his head to the east, nor to the west. There was no place to put it. The more he couldn't sleep, the more he thought and looked around, which increased his terror. The boatman's snoring in the cabin erupted from time to time, and the ghost-like oil lamp also went out. Everything in front of him reached the extreme of darkness, so that he could not even see his own outstretched hand.</p>
<p>A gust of wind like a lion's roar swept through, blowing against the reed leaves, making rustling sounds, as if responding. The wind blew straight on Ming'er's face from the cracks in the boat boards. He was drowsy at this time and was awakened by it. He opened his ears and heard the roar of the wind outside, mixed with a burst of messy footsteps. He was terrified and screamed. This scream woke up everyone on the boat, and his mother came to his side, took his hand, and asked, "Ming'er, Ming'er, what's wrong?" Ming'er's face turned pale, his eyes wide open, and his hands were icy cold. His mother knew that he was frightened, so she said, "Ming'er, don't be scared." Ming'er gradually calmed down and heard nothing but the sound of the wind outside. Where did the footsteps come from? It was his own nerves that were out of order. He said, "When I was drowsy and about to fall asleep just now, I suddenly heard a burst of footsteps. I was so scared that I screamed unconsciously. Now I know that I was scaring myself." Then he gradually returned to normal, and his hands warmed up. The wind was still roaring outside, and gusts of cold wind were still blowing on Ming'er's face, making him shiver for a while. He had deeply tasted the bitterness of being a refugee. But in no time, he fell asleep, only able to comfort his pain in his sleep.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Snow White (5) <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Tiansun</p>
<p>But they woke up again soon after falling asleep. It turned out that a joyful song was being transmitted from the forest, directly into their ears.</p>
<p>They knew that this joyful singing sound was hinting that the owner of the small house was coming back and was approaching step by step. But the petite Snow White was so tired that she didn't hear or know anything. She was still sleeping quietly in the bedroom upstairs on the three small beds.</p>
<p>Now we have to go back to the situation in the palace. After issuing the poisonous order to kill Snow White, the queen paced back and forth on the smooth marble floor, waiting impatiently for the hunter to return and report, so as to hear the news of Snow White's tragic death. After waiting for a long time, the hunter finally came and presented the jewel-encrusted box to the queen with both hands. The queen smiled slightly, knowing that he had completed her orders. But she didn't know that what was in the box was not Snow White's heart, but the heart of a wild boar that the hunter had killed in the forest to impersonate it.</p>
<p>Immediately, she hurried to the magic mirror in the secret room again, admired herself in the mirror, and proudly asked, "Mirror on the wall! I want to ask you, who is the most beautiful woman in the world now?"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the answer from the magic mirror was completely unexpected and not what she wanted to hear. She only heard the mirror say loudly, "On the Seven Treasure Mountain, outside the Seventh Waterfall, in the small house of the Seven Dwarfs, lives Snow White. She is the most beautiful woman in the world!"</p>
<p>The queen grinned and took out the treasure box, placed it in front of the mirror, and said coldly, "Snow White is already dead. Look—inside this treasure box is her heart!"</p>
<p>The magic mirror, after hearing these words, made a sound that was both mocking and sarcastic, and replied, "Snow White is still alive. She is the most beautiful woman in the world. What is contained in the treasure box in your hand is actually the heart of a wild boar!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the queen was furious and couldn't help but roar. It turned out that the hunter had disobeyed her orders and secretly let Snow White go. She calmed herself down and said to herself, "This hateful slave dares to ruin my affairs. I must punish him well to calm my anger. But my first step is to deal with this little thing, Snow White. I must first go to the dwarfs' house and finish her off. In less than a day, I will be the most beautiful woman in the world again."</p>
<p>Poor Snow White initially thought that the small house was inhabited by seven orphans, but it turned out that they were not orphans, but seven dwarfs. They were very old, but very small, and each of them was a very playful and funny character. For hundreds of years, they went to a large mountain every day and worked diligently with their pickaxes all day long. When the sun went down, they threw down their pickaxes and sang in unison, "Hi ho, hi ho, our work is done, we're going home."</p>
<p>It was this singing sound of returning home that was carried far into the house, waking up the sleeping animals, who slipped outside. Only Snow White was still sleeping upstairs, continuing to have her good dreams.</p>
<p>Statement: The illustrations for Snow White in the previous two issues were drawn by Jiang Xiaoliu, a 13-year-old child. Because the manuscripts were not signed, this statement is made.</p>

<h3 id="e148">"January 28th" is Here <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Jiyuan, Fifth Grade Student, Minsheng Elementary School</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, January 28th is already in its seventh year! Counting on our fingers, this year is exactly the seventh year! I never thought that the seven years after January 28th would be the days when China could hold its head high.</p>
<p>Having spent January 28th on an isolated island, this year is the second year. When everyone celebrated January 28th last year, although everyone felt the bad environment, they were very optimistic. What about this year? The environment is still the same, but we are even more optimistic.</p>
<p>We know that January 28th was the first shot of China's resistance to foreign aggression. From January 28th, people all over the country learned a valuable lesson: to strive for survival, only resistance is good. Non-resistance will surely lead to destruction. Resistance is the only way to survive.</p>
<p>That's right, now that we have resisted, aren't we more free than before? This is an iron-like explanation!</p>
<p>Although seven years have passed since January 28th, the spirit of courageously dying for the country of the martyrs of January 28th must always be imprinted in our minds. Our responsibilities will become even heavier in the future. Everyone work hard! Fulfill the responsibility of a child.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Report Card <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Sheng, Sixth Grade Student, Shanghai Elementary School</p>
<p>After the exams, the winter vacation began, and the report card was sent from the school to my home and presented before my eyes. After reading that report card, I was really ashamed! It took so much of my father's hard-earned money, but the grades I got were so bad. If I don't work harder, it's really inexcusable. The grades for "English" and "Natural Science" on the report card are both C, and "Arithmetic" is B. I think I must work twice as hard on these major subjects in the future. "Calligraphy" is D! But I am not discouraged. I will practice calligraphy every morning to correct the mistakes of the past. The teacher also said that "I am not diligent in service," and I really don't want to do things very much. This is probably due to laziness! I think I need to change this character as well.</p>
<p>Children! Report cards are a good opportunity for us to get rid of our bad habits in the past! I hope that the children will keep the report card on the table for a long time as our motto, work hard on the subjects with bad grades, and also work hard on the subjects with good grades, and get rid of bad habits, so that we can become good students.</p>

<p>— Wu Wanchuan, Fifth Grader, Xin Ya Elementary School</p>
<p>Dear Senior Xuejie Youren,</p>
<p>It's been a long time since we last met, and I miss you very much. How has your health been recently? I heard Sister Aizhen say that you have been enjoying playing a lot lately and haven't been reviewing your lessons at home. I think you must know the ancient saying, "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time!" Time passes and cannot be returned, so we should seize it tightly and use it for various endeavors; especially we children should seize the opportunity of our youth to earnestly seek knowledge, lest we "fail to exert ourselves when young, and only lament our old age." Therefore, I hope you will cherish time, read more, and play less. Sister Ren! You are a person who readily accepts good advice, and I believe you will accept my sincere advice! Wishing you progress in your studies. Your younger sister, Wanchuan, the twenty-fifth.</p>

<p>Master! It has been more than ten days since you caught me and locked me in this cage. I appreciate your kindness in giving me water to drink and rice to eat every day; people say I am fortunate, but I hate my bad fate, "because I have lost my freedom and my spirit of self-reliance."</p>
<p>Master, are you going to say I am still young? In fact, I am not small, and even if I were small, does that mean a small bird cannot be self-reliant and must be raised by you?</p>
<p>Master, please save your water and rice, and spare your efforts, let me go out, and give me a chance for freedom and self-reliance!</p>

<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Equipment: Two small national flags, one flour sifter. Twenty to forty people.</p>
<p>Preparation: First, draw a straight line in the field. Forty feet in front of this line, draw two circles with a diameter of four feet. Dig a hole in each circle and plant a national flag in each hole. Then, divide the children into two teams, each team standing behind the line.</p>
<p>Method: Appoint another person to be the starter. On the command, the first person from each team runs towards the national flag, enters the circle, bows three times to the national flag, and then raises the national flag and shouts, "Long Live the Republic of China!" After shouting, they put the flag back in the hole and run back to their team and tap the second person's hand. The second person does the same. This continues until the last person. The team that finishes first without breaking the rules wins.</p>
<p>Rules: 1. Do not run before the command. 2. Two people must clap hands behind the line, not in front of the line. 3. Bow first, then shout the slogan, then return the flag to the hole, and then run back, in the correct order.</p>

<p>— Yan Gong</p>
<p>"Silent as cicadas in winter" is used to describe a weak person who dares to be angry but dares not speak, or who has hidden grievances. It contains so much tragic resentment, a mix of sour, spicy, and bitter flavors. There are examples to prove it, as reported in the news:</p>
<p>"In the Japanese Lower House meeting, the deputies unanimously cast votes of confidence in the government's plan and expressed full cooperation. However, the current Japanese Diet can only approve the government's work, and the legislative function has long been lost; even those deputies who formerly opposed government policies are now silent as cicadas in winter, not uttering a word."</p>
<p>"At the intersection of the British and French concessions and the Chinese area in Tianjin, there is only a deep, long, and narrow passageway for passage. When entering or leaving the Chinese area, one must take off all clothing and socks and stand naked, regardless of gender, in the passageway to await a thorough search. In this cold winter, the pedestrians, standing naked on the road, cannot help but shiver. If they utter even a slight complaint, they will be punched and kicked. People who suffer this abuse have no choice but to endure humiliation and shame, and remain silent as cicadas in winter."</p>
<p>Although the subjects of these two news items are different, one being members of parliament and the other being ordinary people suffering under the iron heel, their situations are the same, and their sad and helpless emotions are also the same. Needless to say, the Chinese people in the occupied areas live a life of misery every day, at the mercy of others for their lives and property. Even the Japanese people, under the high pressure of the militarists' brutal and bellicose policies, have no freedom or security. Even those high-ranking members of parliament, although they have now seen through the militarists' hypocritical propaganda and feel that the fate of the country is hanging by a thread, have long been subdued by the militarists and dare not act differently. So everyone can only be "silent as cicadas in winter."</p>

<p>— Ge Er</p>
<p>The Japanese "wartime conservation movement" is indeed more successful than ours in China. Some time ago, I saw that Japanese elementary school students didn't even have leather shoes to wear, so when I saw that our "children" not only didn't go barefoot, but there were even several "children's clothing companies" opening in Shanghai, I couldn't help but feel a little disheartened. They are the aggressor nation, willing to "conserve" even the leather shoes of elementary school students to strengthen their aggression. And we China, is the nation being aggressed upon, if the war of resistance is unfavorable, then the fate of "slave" will immediately fall on the heads of every compatriot throughout the country.</p>
<p>Later, I learned from the newspaper that Japanese cabinet ministers were celebrating something and stopped drinking champagne, instead drinking rice wine. This top-down spirit of strict conservation is truly great. Also, recently, "Central China Commander" Hata Shunroku "General" returned home in glory, and the imperial family, in order to save kerosene, completely put aside cars. So the vehicles welcoming this "General" were very apologetic and had to use "horse-drawn carriages."</p>
<p>Recently, there was another news item in the newspaper, "Lions and tigers in Tokyo Zoo also participate in the wartime conservation movement." According to that news, "Two lions in the Tokyo Zoo are also participating in the national wartime conservation movement, abandoning horse meat and feeding on rabbit meat and fish. The practice of replacing horse meat with rabbit meat for the two lions' two meals a day has been going on for several months. But giving them three raw mackerel for dinner is 'a recent development'." In this situation, there is no doubt that conservation will continue. Although the zookeeper reported, "At first, the two lions did not eat this fish, but now the two lions also eat the fish with relish," whether they will still "eat with relish" after not being able to eat meat and eating fish remains to be "tested." However, the "conservation" of lions is limited in any case.</p>
<p>"Lions roar when they are hungry!" In this way, I can't help but worry about our "friendly nation" when I see "Lions and tigers in Tokyo Zoo also participate in the wartime conservation movement!"</p>
<h3 id="e156">A Wailing in the Cold Night <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>The mad wind emitted a whistling, triumphant laugh, and the withered, yellow leaves forced out rustling, sorrowful sighs. This scene revealed the arrival of the hateful, cruel winter, hinting at a tragic scene of the survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>On a certain night, it was almost twelve o'clock. Most of the shops on both sides of the road, except for cigarette shops, food shops, public stoves, and a few unnamed small shops, had closed their doors and windows, ending their day's business. Fortunately, the streetlights on the asphalt road emitted a faint light, along with the lights from the shops, which made the road somewhat bright. Everything on the road indicated a state of silence, except for the plane trees by the roadside, three or four rickshaws, and a few pedestrians wearing thick overcoats. What a tragic, silent winter night!</p>
<p>"×……×……Evening News"! This was the cry of the evening news seller, coming from afar with the wind; this cry was mixed with sighs of enduring the cold. A person around fifty years old, wearing a tattered black cotton-padded jacket, with short, torn trousers underneath, dragging a pair of heelless shoes, holding several copies of the ×× Evening News in his hand, walked closer from afar, and the sound of his cry gradually approached. However, since he received the newspapers, not many customers had visited; although his stomach was still empty, constantly emitting faint sounds of hunger; he touched the money in his pocket, and besides the capital, he hadn't earned enough to buy some snacks, so he had no choice but to eat some cold wind to satisfy his hunger. Under the pressure of life, he had to make a decision, to sound his roar and move forward, hoping to attract customers and fulfill some of his hopes—but when the road was so cold and desolate, and there were so few pedestrians, how could that hope be achieved? But he didn't ask, just moved forward and roared.</p>
<p>Afterwards, his cry was already hoarse, his mouth was dry, and his feet were stiff from the cold, but he didn't care, still emitting some of his last roars and moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Cutting Off "Gonads" <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Lishi</p>
<p>Gonads (Gonita Gland) is a physiological term, also known as sex glands. In males, it is the testicles, and in females, it is the ovaries. Testicles and ovaries, in addition to producing sperm and eggs, also engage in endocrine functions, which are crucial to physiology.</p>
<p>Gonads are a necessary tool for reproducing the population and continuing the human race. If people did not have gonads, the world today would be a different place.</p>
<p>People have intelligence, foolishness, virtue, and wickedness. According to geneticists, the intelligent and virtuous produce the intelligent and virtuous, and the foolish and wicked produce the foolish and wicked. "Dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes, and rats are born to dig holes in walls." Although this is a folk saying criticizing human species, it is also influenced by genetics. Therefore, the anthropologist Galton, in order to improve the character and physique of the human race, also advocated selecting spouses, eliminating bad breeds, and preserving good breeds based on Mendel's law of heredity. Eugenics thus began, and the gonads began to encounter misfortune.</p>
<p>According to recent news, members of the Japanese Minseito Party believe that promoting racial eugenics is a pressing issue today and intend to propose a bill in the Diet to cut off gonads in order to advance this cause. The reasons and specific measures on which they based this were not mentioned in the telegram, so it is impossible to speculate. However, from a human perspective, the so-called "superior" Yamato race certainly needs to be improved.</p>
<p>The character of the Yamato race's soldiers, as newly manifested in China, is: tyrannical, greedy, lecherous, and murderous. Not only are Chinese compatriots suffering from their actions, and cursing them, but even righteous friendly people, witnessing these atrocities, must spit and condemn them. This is not only a disgrace to humanity, but also a sin. However, we cannot say that this manifestation is entirely due to the Yamato race's innate heredity, but rather the result of the anti-China policies promoted by their militarists, in other words: due to postnatal education. For this reason, we believe that the Minseito Party members' proposal of a "racial eugenics protection bill" advocating the cutting off of gonads seems not to have "hit the nail on the head." No wonder it has "aroused strong opposition from all sides," of course, the biggest background of opposition is the fascist militarists. In order to have a large number of tools of aggression, the fascist militarists, not long ago, incited so-called scholars who used to advocate birth control to advocate encouraging childbirth. Now, cutting off gonads and completely removing the function of the sex glands, how can they tolerate it? This further shows the Minseito Party members' "lack of understanding of the times."</p>
<p>However, coming back to the point, the Japanese Diet is now in the clutches of the Japanese militarists. Generally speaking, members dare not say much about national policies, lest they stroke the tiger's whiskers and provoke the tiger's wrath. Their attendance in the Diet is like going to a school to listen to stories; in order to fulfill formalities and cope with the "porters," they have to come up with some novel, non-essential topics to start a debate and harmonize the gloomy atmosphere of the Diet. Look at the term "cutting off gonads," how attention-grabbing it is. But let us not forget that this is precisely the cry of Japanese members in a declining Japanese Diet.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Military School Glory <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Hua</p>
<p>“Brother Rat”</p>
<p>Produced by Warner Bros., Shown at Cathay Theatre</p>
<p>Regarding American films using the navy and army as the background, we can probably see two points: (1) They are declaring America's military expansion, showing the power of their navy and army. In the past, many such films were made with the consent of the government's navy and army authorities, and the government gave them great assistance. From this point of view, this threatening meaning to the world is clear and obvious; (2) Not showing the power of American naval and army cannons and aircraft carriers in terms of military equipment, the focus of the film is on how the current American government is strictly training their naval and army recruits to cope with the next more terrible war.</p>
<p>The past "High Flyers" and "Cadets on Parade" represent this typical type of film.</p>
<p>"Brother Rat" is also a film similar to "Cadets on Parade": taking the American military school as the background, while specially emphasizing how these young and strong young soldiers are dissolute in school, how they roll around in a pink atmosphere all day long, they not only dare to break into the principal's house and flirt with the principal's daughter, but even these students who are making trouble at night also bring those young girls to the dormitories of the military school. Under such a serious theme, through the erotic, decadent American playwrights, this "Military School Glory" representing the life of American army students has also become a flirting paradise.</p>
<p>Drama should reflect society, but through the hands of American playwrights, true materials all become a confused mess. "Brother Rat" is just a small example of this.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we can say that "Brother Rat" has lost its authenticity. Although drama has its exaggerations, a drama that loses its authenticity is, of course, very low in value.</p>
<p>This script was originally adapted from an ancient stage play. Although the distribution of characters is quite lively, most of the development of the play takes place in that dormitory, and it has not escaped the scope of stage play.</p>
<p>However, in terms of compilation techniques, this is naturally a fairly successful film: the personalities of the three male protagonists and the demeanor of the two female protagonists reveal the characteristics of each character in the film; that reckless and presumptuous Billy; that woman-hating Crawford; that melancholic Edward; apart from Crawford's character not being clear enough, the personalities of Billy and Edward are captured strongly and vividly.</p>
<p>As for the atmosphere of the whole play, under the support of William Keighley, its tone is not only cheerful, but also unusually humorous; we are not saying that the excellence of the director's techniques conceals the erotic, distorted poison of the whole play, but among the many techniques used by the director, there are indeed many places worth learning.</p>
<p>We can see a glimpse of William Keighley's techniques from the following two most prominent scenes: (1) Edward is still staying at Betsy's house, when suddenly there is a assembly bugle outside. Edward intends to run out, but suddenly remembers his hat. He comes back in, and Betsy, Betsy's aunt, and the maid all follow Edward around the room. Edward goes there, and they follow him there. At this time, Edward is indeed looking for his hat, and the audience is also looking for Edward's hat, until Edward finds the hat on the tea chair and smoothly passes the scene; this scene is very ordinary, but after William Keighley's treatment, it becomes a very lively scene; (2) the army principal's daughter, Greer, sneaks into Billy's dormitory and teaches Edward chemistry. Although the techniques used are stage-like, through the suffocating, tense atmosphere, it deeply captures the audience's emotions. The techniques used are: first, the swaying of shadows, the lights being turned off in the dormitory, and the frantic hiding; second, the principal comes in to check at night with a flashlight; third, Billy brings Betsy to knock on the window; fourth, the dormitory supervisor who is checking the dormitory suddenly comes in, and everyone is caught drinking and eating bread. When the supervisor comes in, everyone hides too late, and the director vividly depicts the chaotic state of the room. At the same time, everyone thinks that this time it is over, but the playwright makes the principal's daughter stick out her head and say, "The principal wouldn't be happy to know either!" as the ending of the whole play, which is clever enough.</p>
<p>As for the actors, I think Eddie Albert, who plays Edward, has the most obvious and successful personality. The rest, such as Wayne Morris, Priscilla Lane, and Jane Wyman, are all fluent and natural.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's (26th) issue of this journal, in the article "Salted Pork Shop and Little Traitors," the character "enter" was incorrectly printed with an × mark. This is hereby corrected.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Adoring the Remains and Remembering the Old Righteous Man, Opening the Eyes of the Illiterate and Asking Questions to the Little Teacher</p>
<p>Let's say that Miss Jin Danyun was dining at the Lingcun restaurant with the two Misses He and their fiancés. Because today is Sunday, many people who came to visit the martyrs' tombs came here to eat, and in a moment, it felt like there were clouds of scholars and ladies. Wang Jing then went to greet other guests. Of course, this back room did not have just seven or eight seats, and Wang Jing was not the only one serving. Wang Jing left, and others came to greet, but the guests adding rice themselves is now taken for granted. Recently, young men and women are ashamed of developing a lazy and arrogant style. Since I am a human being, I also have four limbs and hundreds of bones, and I am not a cripple, so why should others do some small things for me? More than ten years ago, some young masters and ladies from wealthy families would often call for servants and maids, opening their mouths for tea and reaching out for food. This trend has been reformed a lot in the post-war, emerging China. Although the two Misses He, for example, grew up in luxurious families and have always been abroad, never experiencing any war or suffering in the country, when they returned to their motherland and looked around, they also felt that the future revival of China rested entirely on the shoulders of our young men and women, and this was not an era for leisure and enjoyment. The four people eating at this table today have all been abroad, so they talk casually and inevitably touch on foreign countries. Lin Jiancheng said, "Sixty years ago, Chinese people looked down on foreigners. They said that China was a land of etiquette and righteousness, and foreign countries were barbaric tribes, and even in writing, they used those terrible words on them. For example, the three characters for 'England,' each character had to have a mouth radical added, becoming 咭唎, in order to appear in official documents. Also, when referring to foreigners, they called them 'foreign devils.' Even though Shanghai was a commercial port where Chinese and foreigners lived together, they still called them something devils, such as finger-ghost foreign instrument devil and the like. This self-aggrandizing mentality could never be changed. Later, as a backlash, it changed to everything foreign being good. Whatever foreigners have, Chinese people must also have. The ancient Chinese books say that Dong Shi imitating Xi Shi's frown is absolutely correct. Naturally, Europe and America are advanced countries, and they have many inventions, and we enjoy the fruits of their labor, benefiting a lot from their light. But some things can be learned; some things don't need to be learned; some things work very well in Europe and America, but don't work in China; some things are a noble profession in Europe and America, but become terrible when they come to China." Pointing to Miss Jin, he said, "Your current guide was considered a lowly profession more than ten years ago!" (25)</p>

<p>— Wang Weiwo</p>
<p>Wu Song and Pan Jinlian</p>
<p>I have seen three productions of "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" in Shanghai. One was starring Zhou Xinfang, one was starring Gai Jiaotian, and one was recently performed by Yu Sulian at the Golden Theatre.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinfang's performance was based on Ouyang Yuqian's script, which differed from those performed by others in that it contained many new nationalistic terms in the lyrics. Xinfang's Wu Song is known for his vigor, and his expressions and acting skills are beyond Gai Wu's reach. Moreover, Xinfang's drama focuses on acting, unlike Gai Wu, who makes money by selling Wu Er, so in practice, Xinfang's drama is the most brilliant. However, I have seen Xinfang's drama twice, once with Zhao Xiaolan playing Pan Jinlian and once with Wang Xichun playing Pan Jinlian, neither of which was very good. Moreover, Li Hansan, who played Wu Da, lacked artistic talent, so Xinfang was unable to achieve the effect of green leaves enhancing the peony. Judging from the three performances of "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" that I have seen, the most well-matched cast was that of Gai Wu. I previously saw Gai Wu perform this play with Li Guiyun from the north playing Pan Jinlian, Wang Xiaofang playing Ximen Qing, and Shou Xiaoshan, known for playing Wu Da well, playing Wu Da. The completeness of this cast was remarkable. Recently, Yu Sulian performed this play at the Golden Theatre with Ma Shenglong playing Wu Song and Li Junyu playing Ximen Qing, both of whom were mediocre. Although Sulian is good at playing shrewish roles, she failed to portray Pan Jinlian accurately, so the performance was not satisfactory. The good thing is that Liu Yunting, who played Wu Da, had considerable artistic talent and inadvertently discovered this new talent.</p>
<p>Liu Yunting and Liu Binkun and Liu Yunfang are brothers. He has a martial arts background. His elder brother, Binkun, is a famous clown in Jiangnan. Yunting received guidance from his elder brother and is also skilled in open-mouth jumps. Binkun's performance as Wu Da can be called first-rate in Jiangnan. However, he rarely performs, so few people know about it. Yunting's leg work is extremely solid. He has worked hard at walking low and somersaulting. This time, he showed it at the Golden Theatre, and it was greatly appreciated by the general public. Gai Xiaoshan's Wu Da is certainly good, but unfortunately, he has a Kunqu Opera background and speaks mostly Suzhou dialect. Compared with Yunting, Gai Xiaoshan is slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Because Liu Yunting's Wu Da was a surprising success, the facts tell us that Liu Binkun's performance as Wu Da must be excellent. The Kunqu Opera actresses in Shanghai who are good at playing Pan Jinlian is Mao Jianqiu. I would like to suggest to the Performing Arts Association that if they were to arrange a Wu Song and Pan Jinlian for a charity performance, with Zhou Xinfang and Gai Jiaotian playing Wu Song separately, Mao Jianqiu playing Pan Jinlian, and Liu Binkun playing Wu Da, it would not only be able to make a splash, but it could also be said to be an unprecedented and unparalleled good show.</p>

<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>Almost a month ago, I heard that the Art Academy was going to have an art exhibition different from other art exhibitions. This art exhibition was finally seen yesterday amidst extreme crowding. I lingered inside for a good hour and indeed discovered several characteristics different from other art exhibitions.</p>
<p>The first characteristic is that all the proceeds from this exhibition are donated to refugees, unlike other so-called disaster relief art exhibitions that only deduct relief or recover the cost of materials.</p>
<p>The second characteristic is that although the Chinese and Western paintings in the venue are priced, they all have a number. As long as you spend five yuan on a drawing ticket, you can draw a work by the teachers and students of the Art Academy and many famous artists. Last week, the national painting of Liu Haisu, the principal of the Art Academy, exhibited at the Great World, cost at least fifty yuan per piece, but now you can draw it here for only five yuan.</p>
<p>The third characteristic is that the students of the Art Academy will draw portraits of guests on the spot during the exhibition period. This characteristic is the characteristic among the three characteristics.</p>
<p>There were so many people, forming a semi-circular meat screen, inside which was a middle-aged man with deep eyes and a hooked nose acting as a temporary model, having his portrait drawn by five male and female students from the Art Academy. Even the four or five hundred pairs of eyes of the audience were fixed on him alone. It took about fifteen minutes to complete the drawing. When each portrait was placed in front of him by each student from the Art Academy, he looked at his own little image as if choosing a mirror.</p>
<p>"They all look alike! I don't want that one, I can't even pick one out!"</p>
<p>He reluctantly looked through them one by one. But according to the rules, one drawing ticket gets one picture, two drawing tickets get two pictures. If he wanted all the similar ones, he would need five drawing tickets. Finally, he got permission from the staff to give three drawing tickets, and the other two were considered complimentary.</p>
<p>When that man left his seat and went back satisfied, the Art Academy students, who seemed very tired but were still so beautiful, were already drawing portraits of another female guest without stopping.</p>

<p>Correction</p>
<p>In yesterday's Liu game, the 7th game, 15th move, Chariot 2 to 3 was incorrectly printed as to 2.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the incorrect printing of the 11th game's "Winning the Lottery" with the "Three-Way Red Army" as "Seven-Way Black Army". In the 6th game, the edge horse on the first rank is a red horse, and in the 4th game, the 42nd move, Horse 9 retreats 7, was incorrectly printed as 8 retreats 7. In the 3rd game, the 27th move, Cannon 8 advances 2, was incorrectly printed as advances 2.</p>
<p>In the explanation of the opening of the first game, the fourth sentence, "Black's Chariot 9 to 8" should be changed to "Red's". In the same game, the ninth sentence "(Even if the Red Chariot restricts the horse on the third rank)" should be changed to "Black Chariot". Also, in the 4th game, the 29th sentence, "(If Red's Pawn 7 advances)" should be changed to "Black's".</p>

<p>Beginner's Guide (Continued)</p>
<p>One of the methods of moving backwards is to place both feet flat on the ground, lean the body to the left, and apply force on the outer edge of the left foot (i.e., the outer two wheels). Apply force on the inner edge of the right foot (i.e., the inner two wheels). Use the right foot to push forward, forming an arc on the ground. After the right foot pushes forward, move it behind the left heel, keeping both feet on the ground. At this point, lean the body to the right, apply force on the inner edge of the left foot, and apply force on the outer edge of the right foot. Use the left foot to push forward, also forming an arc on the ground. After the left foot pushes forward, move it behind the right heel. Repeat these steps alternately left and right to continue moving backwards. When moving backwards, the two feet form arcs on the ground as shown in the diagram below:</p>
<p>Another method of moving backwards is to stand firmly first, keep the body straight and slightly leaning back, point both feet inward, so that the two feet form a figure eight. Bring the two knees together, and apply force on the inner edges of both feet simultaneously (i.e., the inner two wheels), pushing them outwards and then pulling them back together. When pulling them back together, slightly lift the heels. After pulling them back together, point the toes inward again, apply force on the inner edges (inner wheels), and push outwards.</p>
<p>When the practice of moving backwards becomes pure and smooth, lift one of the pushing feet, and you can move backwards independently on one foot.</p>
<p>When moving backwards, the main foot must be in front of the guest foot's toes before it lands. When the toes leave the ground, wait for the main foot to move back and land, then use the guest foot to push forward with force. At the same time, lean the whole body backwards, and when the main leg starts to move, bend it first and then straighten it.</p>
<p>Method of Changing from Forward to Backward Beginners who can already stand and move forward may want to know how to change direction. At this time, you must pay attention to the following two points: (1) When turning, the most important thing to avoid is jumping with your feet suddenly; (2) Both feet are subject to the command of the body, not the other way around. Therefore, when changing direction, you must first turn the whole body, and then the two feet will follow.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Li Da Wu was a famous sharp-tongued person.</p>
<p>People in Beijing understand every word in the Peking Opera. Even if someone is scolding you, how can you use harsh words to hurt them? Mei Rongzhai hesitated a bit, and then he had no choice but to sulk. This led to a great disaster, and he didn't perform for many days. It wasn't until Liu Hongxiang became popular that he helped him perform in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Long Changsheng's name could be said to be known throughout the country. However, when he first performed in Beijing, his appeal was not good. At that time, he was performing in a certain park, and his daily salary was fifty strings of cash (insiders call the salary "carriage money"). At that time, it couldn't be considered a small amount. One day, he was scheduled to perform "Dingjun Mountain," with Long playing Huang Zhong and Li playing Yan Yan. That day, the audience was very sparse, with only a few dozen people in total. Seeing that it was getting dark, and several people had dinner appointments (people in Beiping called having social engagements "having a dinner appointment"), they left early. The performers on stage felt even more embarrassed. When Boss Long came on stage in the eleventh scene, he changed the original line "The great general is majestic on all sides" to the short sentence "Watching the red sun set." One reason was that the audience was small and he was very unhappy. Another reason was that there were so few people in front of the stage, making it difficult to put on a good performance, and he felt that he had no majesty at all. So Boss Long just casually grabbed a line. But he didn't know that the Li Da Wu, who was playing Yan Yan, was a famous sharp-tongued person. Even if others didn't provoke him, he would find a way to annoy people. Moreover, today, Long Changsheng himself had started it by changing the original line and turning the "Zhongdong" rhyme into a "Suobo" rhyme, as if he was deliberately making things difficult for him. You can imagine how the unforgiving Li Bad-Mouth could not mock Boss Long? He was a natural wit and immediately changed his original line "Winning the battle at Tiandang Mountain" to "Carriage money exceeds the seats." When Boss Long heard this, his face turned red, and he realized how foul his mouth was. This really ridiculed him thoroughly. Afterwards, he became aware of the situation and paid attention to him. Although Long Changsheng was not driven away by him, he was not very successful for a long time. It wasn't until later when he joined Sixi and was supported by Xi Juxian that he became famous, and every performance was full. Although Li Wu had a bad mouth, he also knew how to admire people with real talent. He always worked well with Lao Tan when they performed together. If Long Changsheng hadn't started messing with him first, he would never have joked with the talented Boss Long. As the saying goes, "There is always someone better, and there is always a sky beyond the sky." It can be seen that it was not easy to perform Peking Opera in Beijing in the past. It was precisely because the opera profession was not easy to make a living from that there were so many good performers. Nowadays, as long as someone supports them, they dare to go on stage in two or three years, and they have never suffered any hardships anywhere. May I ask, is such a performance still worth watching?</p>
