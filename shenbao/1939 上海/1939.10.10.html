<h3>雙十節回憶廿八年</h3>
<p>一九一一年辛亥十月十日，中國革命軍倡義於武昌。前乎此者，義旗亦旣數舉，均告失敗。及是年是日，一舉功成，締造共和、建中華民國。迄今年今日，蓋舊邦新命而閱二十八年矣。夫以二十八年之歲月，衡諸歷史，實祇至暫之片段；論事，自來以「三十年爲一世」，是猶不足一世；論人，人壽幾何，如駒過隙，然亦必「三十曰壯，」是尙未及壯年；况在五千年之大族，孕有無盡最之生機，承先啟後，方興未艾，則雖謂廿八載無足稱可也。</p>
<p>造化洵好弄哉。溯自人類有紀錄以來，國際之悲歡離合，盛衰興亡，其演變之劇，科學之鉤玄探微，征服自然，其創見之多，固莫甚於此廿八載者；即在中國，忽忽廿八載間之內在波瀾，外來遭遇，極動盪，極嚴重，極慘痛，極光輝，不但爲中國歷史所曠古未有，亦任何國族，任何時期，無得與此廿八載間之中國相倫比。試作回憶，則一切可憂可喜可歌可泣之事績，歷歷盡在眼底心頭，抑亦無一而非今之老年壯年人所身經目擊；而今年今日，猶滯留於此最精采之大時代中也。</p>
<p>民國建立以來之種種，不勝複述，亦不必複述。顧有値得槪括比較言之者：中國在淸朝末葉之國際地位，民族意識，政治現象，文化水準，經濟情况，社會組織，閱甘八載而至今茲，雖不夠理想標準，不夠競勝現代，然各有顯著之進步，則有目共覩者也。及抗戰軍興，弱點暴露雖多，然國族優長之具有明證者允不一而足。一八九五年以後，國際以中國爲愚味可欺，瓜分之議四起，幸賴均勢，始保殘喘；迄民國初期，固猶託命於均勢之下，不可諱也。時勢推移，各國力量漸由消長而懸殊；均勢之局，搖搖欲墜。誠使中國現象一如淸季，則至遲而至最近二三年，英法被制歐洲，美國愛莫能助此不知自助者；中國其亡，日本獨覇，歐美人在遠東詎復有站足地。幸而中國決心抗戰，此在主觀爲救亡圖存，而客觀功能則因對於侵略國家奮勇周旋，乃得搘拄遠東垂毀之秩序；不特如此而已，并使歐亞兩洲之侵略國家不能沆瀣一氣，是中國又無異爲整個世界均勢作有力且有效之鬬爭也。英法人士其秉良知而言之，若非中國抗戰，則英法不將於歐亞兩洲同時遭遇無法兼顧之更大威脅耶？中國抗戰爲立國之必要，非以表演於國際，然中國國際地位之昂進，遠過淸季，有爲國際所必不吾認者矣。</p>
<p>民族意識者，立國國際之精神壁壘也。辛亥革命之所成就，自可反證其爲政治革命；然凡爲老年壯年之能回憶辛亥革命情况者，必不吾認當時革命實以民族意識爲基礎。蓋當時滿漢之界限未泯者，僅餘宮廷宗室；彼極少數者，目億兆人爲異族而君臨之，宜其無幸。况乃對外喪師失地之餘，政治窳敗，綱紀隳地，賣官鬻爵，賄賂公行，苛捐雜稅，民不聊生，又復以愚民爲事乎？武昌倡義而各省響應，氣勢之盛，得未曾有；然其間所流露之民族意識，相當普遍而絕不若今茲之普遍且深入也。今茲中國之人民；遭兵燹而不怨，赴犧牲而不辭；苦戰逾二年，軍隊發揮其再接再厲之勇，故最近猶大捷於湘北；人民保持其同仇敵愾之心，故於種種政治方式之迷惑，委屈苟安之引誘，嗤之以鼻，無動於中；此非民族意識普遍而深入不爲功也。</p>
<p>至於一般政治現象，文化水準，經濟情况，社會組織，我人不遑列舉廿八年前後之事例，逐一對比；然往年極黯淡而近年趨昌明，此允任何老年壯年所躬親體騐。此在非常時期，備見變態；即此變態，亦難想像得之於淸末。姑述二三端；今日官廳羅致之技師專家，視淸季之各種坐辦會辦如何？今日小學敎科書之質量，視淸季小學堂之課程如何？今日國貨市塲之商品，視淸季市魔之洋貨土貨如何？今日工商各界之團體，視淸季僅有「官督商辦」之商會如何？於此推之，可以槪見。</p>

<h3>蘇聯義大利報紙　討論和戰問題　勸以希特勒建議進行談判　美報斥責希特勒言論荒謬</h3>
<p>莫斯科　消息報本日發表社論、題曰「和乎、戰乎？」其辭云「波蘭戰事業已結束數週、此無一人能吾認之事實、波軍已完全被俘、波政府巳逃往國外、除上層地主及資產階級以外、波蘭無一社會層忍願保全彼人工造成、以壓迫一切民族連波蘭人在內爲能事之紙老虎式國家、蘇德兩國政府業已開始在前波蘭領土上恢復和平與秩序、而使人民各就其民族特徵、安居樂業、波蘭國家機搆之迅速崩潰、已使西歐戰事無再事繼續之理由、波蘭決不能恢復原狀、此盲人皆知之理、然英法則仍以恢復波蘭爲口號、對德從事戰爭、此戰爭實爲無意識之屠殺、而停戰則與各國人民利益相符、雖可仟意接受、拒絕或修正希特勒之建議、但必須認識該建議實可爲談判和平之基礎、英法兩政府旣已疊决宣言願得和平、對此結束戰事之可能、自當加以考慮、然而截至現在、英法報紙對希特勒演說之批評並不表示此意、大多數均主張拒絕、英法應繼續作戰、直至目的完全達到爲止、但各報論調中有一事殊堪注意、即過去的主要條件、恢復波蘭、現已比較沉寂、而代之者則爲「消滅希特勒主義」、據稱英法目前作戰之根本唯一目的爲反抗希特勒思想、因該思想爲歐洲乃至全世界發生戰爭之唯一主要原因、此種論調當然係英法官方立塲之反映、然吾人其能昧然加以接受、作爲繼續戰爭之理由乎、曰、吾、夫任何人對於任何思想、自有其擁護或反對之權利、但苟因某某人反對某種思想、而即用爲屠殺人類之理由、則其荒謬與無意識、與中世紀時代屠殺異端之宗敎戰爭、又何以異、歷史早已證明此種思想及宗敎戰爭、結果僅爲整個人類之屠殺及文化之毀滅、任何思想決不能用刀劍或火熖毀滅、對於希特勒主義或任何政治主張、世人自有尊重或憎惡之權、然進行『消滅希特勒主義』之戰爭、實爲政治上的大錯、截至最近英法統治階級對於流血之事、特別是爲任何思想而作任何犧牲之事、從未表現過份熱忱、歷史且證明事實正屬相反、崇高的原則及思想每經揭舉爲卑俗及物質的慾望之烟幕、即在目前、所謂反抗希特勒思想或精神之口號、是吾爲英法統治階級其他慾望、例如鞏固其統治地位之烟幕、亦正難言、關於此點、蕭柏納在『新政治家與民族』近頃發表之論文殊足注意、蕭氏曰：『波蘭戰爭已成過去、波蘭旣已失敗、吾人已無繼續戰爭之理由、因此吾人乃擲去武士之面具、而坦白承認吾人並不關心波蘭、而僅以恢復原來勢力均衡、摧殘德國爲目的、吾人現並名此舉爲消滅希特勒主義、苟吾人獲勝、則凡爾賽將再現、不過更爲惡劣、而不到二十年、又一戰爭將發生、無論吾人塗以如何濃厚之自由民主派及一切吾人木身今已放棄之廢物、戰爭的理由終不能成立、吾人唯有與希特勒及全世界媾和、而不再惡作劇及毀滅本國人民」、蕭氏之言大都確屬有理、就一切事實觀之、英法統治階級對於波蘭之命運或從希特勒政權下解放德國人民、實屬毫不關心、彼兩國各擁有廣大之殖民地、大英帝國殖民地有人口叫萬五千萬、法國殖民地亦有六千五百萬人、由此、英法政府對德作戰之目的、除抵抗德國耍求、保持此浩大領土、俾得從容剝削億兆之殖民地奴隸之外、尙有何老可言、任何人苟拒絕德國之和平建議、即當擔負戰爭延續、從而戰爭之巨大犧牲及毀滅之責任、戰爭乎？和平乎？高呼『戰至勝利爲止』口號之人乃主張戰爭而反對和平、但此種爭奪世界統治權之戰爭、究於何人有利、對於工人階級、決無和益可言、工人階級在此種戰爭中所得惟有痛苦耳、（九日塔斯電</p>

<p>重慶　據政治部主任陳誠將軍準備於雙十節發表之論文言、日人之攻勢、雖與歐戰之爆發、幾於同其時間、但中國方面之戰略、仍爲消耗戰、惟華人之行動、至於現階段、應較前更趨於積極、更趨於敏捷、同時各陣錢之華軍、皆應採取機動戰略、卽以此决湘北勝利而言、亦爲運用機動戰略之結果、此决勝利之眞實意義、不在長沙之能獲確保、而在能予日軍以嚴重之打擊」、陳將軍預料「戰事日後將益趨於猛烈」、故在未來之時期中、「華方之抗戰、或將愈趨於艱苦、但經過此一艱苦之階段後、中國始有獲取最後勝利之機會」、據陳將軍言、在歐洲局面未澄淸前、中日之戰亦無根本解決之望、中日戰事、實爲世界問題之一環、故與歐洲問題有密切之關係、中國爲獲取最後勝利計、必須保持强大之武力、以便於時機成熟時、作有效之總反攻、最後陳將軍稱、手創中華民國之先烈、可謂旣無武器、又無資金者、然其所以能推翻「滿淸」者、無非恃有「大無畏之革命精神」耳、「至於我人、無論自軍備上言、資金上言、固皆遠過於手創民國之先烈、故我人祇須繼續抗戰、則最後勝利必屬我人也」、（九日美聯社電）</p>

<p>教育消息</p>
<h3>全國　高教教職員人數（上）　歷年遞增至一萬一千餘人　戰時各校減者多而增者少</h3>
<p>（重慶特訊）敎部近頃統計全國專科以上學校戰期前後敎職員槪况甚詳、茲探錄於下、</p>
<p>戰前情形</p>
<p>專科以上學校敎職員大抵隨學校之多寡而增减、民國元年度敎員爲二三一二人、至十七年度敎員爲五二一四人、其原因由於元年度大畢僅四校、專科達二一校、十七年度雖專科减至二五校、而大學增至四九校、大學院茶較專科複雜、其所需敎員自亦較多、十七年度至二十年度、專科以上學校由七五校增至一〇三校、故敎員亦由二一四人增至七〇五三人、二十一年度起、限制文法科學校之設立、敎員亦因之略减、二十一年度以後、理工農醫科學生增加、所需各科敎員、亦逐漸增加、故學生總數、雖因文法科學生减少、尙不及二十年度之學生數、然敎員仍隨理工農醫等科學生而增加、至二十五年度敎員數已達七五六〇人、專科以上學校職員、十七年度以前調査未全、自十七年度以來、亦年有增加、十七年度專科以上學校職員數二九一三人、至二十五年度增至五四二一人如以職敎員、人數併計、减去職敎互兼數、實際敎職員人數、十七年度爲七六六九人、逐年增加、至二十五年度增至一一八五〇人、</p>
<p>茲就十七年度以來每年度之教職員數與學生數比較、則學生每百人中所有之敎員數以十八年度爲最多、計二二人、二十年度及二十一年度爲最少、計一六人、學生每百人中所有之職員數、以十八年度及二十三年度爲最多、計一三人、十九年度及二十年度最少、僅有一〇人、如教職員併計、减去職教互兼人數、其實際教職員數與學生數相比較、則學生每百人中所有之敎職員數、以十八年度爲最多計有三三人、二十年度及二十一年度最少、計有二十四人、大抵十七八年度時、敎職員人數較多、十九年度以後、各校情形較爲安定、故教職員亦逐漸减少、二十二年度以後、敎職員人數之增加、實由於學校及院系之增加、允共對於一部分注重研究之科系、肄習學生雖不踴躍而專門科目敎員則不能减少、此亦爲普遍之事實、然由十七十八年度每學生百人中所有之敎職員數觀之、則近數年度之各校、每學生百人中所有之敎職員數、仍較爲减少、可見各校選聘敎職員、已較前審愼矣、</p>
<p>戰時狀况</p>
<p>自七七事變、平津專科以上校最先停頓、僅少數學校設法遷移內地開學、復因戰區擴大、河北·山東·山西·江蘇·浙江·安微·及上海·南京·北平·天津·等省市境內之專科以上校、或已遷移內地、或則趨於停頓、因學校本身輾轉移動、敎職員一方面受家庭牽制、及交通困難種種限制、一方面因各學校本身之變動、其所需敎職員之人數遂有變動、於是各校敎職員人數增减變動之差數甚大、二十六年度專科以上學校敎職員人數就已得之材料、國立中央大學等七十校、二十六年度敎職員人數、與二十五年度人數比較即有顯著之變遷、二十六年度敎職員人數增加者、計有國立中山大學·武漢大學·湖南大學·四川大學·交通大學·雲南大學·上海醫學院·西北農林專校·同濟大學·省立廣西大學·四川省立敎育學院·私立中法大學·嶺南大學·福建協和學院·武昌華中大學·華南女子·文理學院·同德醫學院等十七校、其中增加數較大者爲四川省立敎育學院、二十六年度敎職員七十人、較二十五年度增三十四人、國立上海醫學一五九人、較二十五年度增七二人、雲南大學九十八人、較上年增四十人、至二十六年度教職員人數均較二十五年度减少之學校、已調查之七十校中、凡五十三校、其敎職員人數减少十分之七以上者、計有暨南大學、由一九六人减至五八人、上海法學院、由四九人减至十人、之江文理學院由八九人减至二三人、新華藝專由五七人减至一二人、减少三分之二以上者、爲無錫國學專修校、由三四人减至一〇人、總計二十五年度中央大學等七十校敎職員數爲九二四一人、至二十六年度减至七一四七人、增加各校、計共增七七九人、而减少各校、則共减二八七三人、增减相較、尙少二〇九四人、</p>
<p>就中央大學等七十校二十六年度敎職員人數觀之、可知公立學校敎職員人數多有增加、計二十六年度敎職員數增加十七校中、國立佔其九、省立佔其二、其次內地之學校、如湘大川大桂大武大等教職員數較有增加、此當由內地各地學生人數增加一部分以及敎職員遷避內地之故、反之、私立學校及戰區或接近戰區各地敎職員人數較二十五年度均有减少一部分私校二十六年度敎職員减少之原因，實亦由經濟窮困、學生减少、聘用敎員不免緊縮、此不僅私校如是、一部分戰區公立學校因經濟之緊縮、亦有疏散敎職員者、觀此七十校敎職員人數增减情形、可見廿六年度全國專科以上校敎職員、總人數必爲之减少而無疑、因戰事影響、使專科以上學校敎職員若干人因此失業、雖敎部於此另有救濟、然亦國家文化上無形的重大損失矣、惟二十七年度中各校遷移已定、課業好轉、敎職員人數、亦已逐漸恢復舊觀、</p>

<h3>金巿無大變幻</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗槃市况、祇有半天行市、蓋下午成交例須翌日交割、因今日適値國慶休假、故同業臨時決議停止午後集會、至十一日本週三照常開市、按昨日上午市况、變幻殊鮮、大致先跌後漲、終仍略疲、全繫外滙之鬆緊、及買賣爲轉移、晨開即受匯市鬆動之影響、而跌落至四千〇三十元低價、嗣以外匯趨軟、其時港帮扒進、立刻回升至四千〇六十三元頂盤、旋則外匯反硬、且證券帮賣意濃密、一度又撳小至四千〇四十元、惟至午刻、港帮東山再起、力吸不已、致遂拉提至四千〇五十三元收盤、結果較上週六軋跌十三元、聞午後塲外稍有成交、形勢略疲、某現金號代多方吐予某錢兌業數十兩、價由四千〇五十三元做小至四十八元之說、惟觀察上週末金價之未有跌進四千元大關、端賴客帮板住、且聞中有某機關亦購進黃金、故前途仍視客帮之有無此繼續能力而定、半天交易尙旺、的七百餘兩、銀樓飾金始終未更、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋跌甚微</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因外匯報鬆、人氣虛弱、一片喊賣聲、加之進者缺乏、開市竟較週六午收價撳小三十六元、錢兌業賣予證券帮十兩、爲四千〇三十元、開後外匯忽轉緊軟、人心激動、貿者漸多、逐步高升、將回高至四千〇五十元關口時、港帮忽起買風、力委某金號及某錢兌業代爲搜購、致趨勢更堅、叉抬高十三元、銀樓帮進金號十兩、爲四千〇六十三元、此後外匯忽又報硬、客帮進意頓淡、加之證券帮賣意殷濃、情况又吿不支、回落二十三元、證券帮售予金號三十兩、爲四千〇四十元、將近午刻、雖外匯仍報鬆硬、但港帮復起買風、又託某金號代進、致爲狀穩定、不久即拉高十三元、某金號進錢兌業二十兩、爲四千〇五十三元作午收價、午後因今日（即十日）爲國慶紀念停市一天、且下午同業所做交易、照例須在隔夜交割、今因適値休假期內、故臨時經同業議決、停止集會、至十一日本週三照常開市、結果照午收價則軋跌十三元、半天三十三元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進須减低三十元光景、現標金照掛脾金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、因烚赤趨勢盤旋、無大上落、致終日未更、大同行仍懸四百十元原價、新同行與上價相同、收進須减小二十元光景、</p>

<h3>外幣跌多漲少</h3>
<p>昨日外幣堅疲不一、緣同業心思恍惚不定、故美金票起落亦頗條忽、初做十三元四角三分、嗣忽步退至十三元二角二分、近午稍回至二角八分、卒以十三元三角爲最後價、結果軋小一角五分、英金票及美金鎊亦各降五角、香港票落三分，安南票低五分、坎拿大票跌四角、澳金票跌一元、日金票小二釐、朝鮮票跌勢允勁、最後價爲一元一角六分、結果軋小一分半、新加坡票則漲一角半、荷蘭票亦升三角、羅比票大一角、菲列濱票高二角半、餘尙平穩、</p>

<p>證劵暗盤、昨日巿况漲風仍勁、丙種除中　後、漲勢未戢、比連籤市價爲允高、各種均叉衝出一元關、形勢良好、爲兩三月來所未見、且此决漲風、業已多日、昨日多方吸收仍猛、因今日停市、昨祇做上午半日交易、而下午暗中買賣、漲勢仍盛、前途乙種當首達五十元大關、丙丁戊必能繼之出關、環境上金子及外滙鬆軟、貼水又繼續下跌、公債在良好環境中、自然的逐步上漲、乃意中事、或可恢復六月十九日以前之市價、昨日交易、丙種乃除中籤計算開價稍低、　以携戶　　、緩緩　高、竟　出四十八元、一時　面極緊、甲　　出五十六元，聞下午已到七元外、其漲勢之挺俏、甲種仍當首屈一指、上午半日市價、結果續漲四角半至九角、成交總數的計一百萬元以上、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交紗布交易所股五十股、價爲四十元正、比前又漲半元云、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報吿、昨日股市、實業股仍甚活潑堅挺、會德豐允爲大衆興趣焦點、此項股票在過去數星期中、因投機在熱所趨、漲風曾無休止、活躍力亦迄未絲毫减退、今且愈演愈烈、竟上騰至五十元五角高價、收盤時五十元二角半有人購進、猶乏賣戶、怡和紗廠股邇來頗被忽視、而今亦有轉機、價漲高達二十一元一角、其他股票甚少變化、橡皮股交易閑散、無足重視、</p>
<h3>疋頭　囤疋頭者　露不安狀</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>近以紗價日落、棉布成本减輕、廠盤鬆動、同業及囤戶手貨漸露不安狀態、亟求脫售、兼以客帮納胃奇嗇、致布價急轉直下、惟熱銷各貨及春銷細紗綫各織品、價仍兀立不動、而細布細斜粗布色布色斜交易零落、價續跌一角至五角、本街同業及批發號趁低略有吸收、成交印花漂染布百五十餘箱、粗布細布斜紋近二百件、各類絨布價雖穩定、惟客戶多採觀望態度、成交亦减縮至二三千疋、客路新交易殊尠做出、定貨趕裝仍旺、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>白貨細布細斜、仍以實銷不旺、步步下挫、續跌每疋二角至三角半、十二磅龍頭細布售盤爲二十一元二角半、細斜二十元零四五角、　　細布細斜俱爲二十元零七角半、行方無開貨、本　同業互相成交者的五百餘件、色貨四君子嗶嘰亦　客銷呆滯、降至每碼六角七分半、直貫六角八分、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今日布疋有九十二件運往香港、又十件運北海、又三件運海防、</p>
<h3>糧食　新榖尙未畢登　粳秈滯銷</h3>
<p>客秈較最高價　步低十六七元</p>
<p>昨日內地來源、由車輪運來原包四五千包、早巿開手、本鄕作客、因見市塲公吿、今日雙十節、休業一天、大都較有添辦、故當時形勢似有轉聚之象、若窰種百哥會喊三十四元至三十二元半、嗣以實銷終少起色、猶復回疲、故結果成交共僅四千餘包、而各貨呈定降不一之局、破粳降一元左右、常錫高破計開三十六七元、中三十四元、新粳三十二元、蘇同破三十二三元、新粳三十元、靑角窰菉種三十二三元、楓涇百哥三十一元至三十元、南港河下白稻三十元、早破二十九元半、原包破三十二元、新羊尖一十四元、决爲二十二元半、蘆尖特二十五元、决爲二十三元半、河下貨二十二元半、計小三五角不等、各客尖貶低半元有奇、江北尖十九元至十八元半、蘆尖十九元半、决爲十八元二角、砶尖十七元至十六元八角、南關特尖二十元、决爲十九元、變元亦帶軟五角左右、陳貨三十二三元、新二十九元至二十八元半、特三十元、</p>
<p>另訊、客秈存底漸豐、到貨小絕、途貨亦復絡繹抵埠、江北新秈目下產地成本已難通劃、蕪秈亦難占利、惟辦存尙夥、勢必逐次運來、巿乃續趨下遊、但本客行囤一度觀望後、旋以價低劃辦、交易尙不寂寞、昨市行情則又步小半元至一元、高秈祇十九元半、决十八元左右、砶秈十七元左右、糙秈十六七元、比之上月最高價已步削十六七元云、</p>
<h3>粉巿沉寂　本街注意棧單貨</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨現粉甚爲沉寂、二號粉廠盤仍持七允原盤、本客交易一致淸淡、客方進胃因廠家催提棧貨、及徵求損失費、辦貨均須即裝、故新交易更難開展、本街因回籠貨比廠盤爲　、大都注意棧單貨、聞老車牌及福新牌價開六元七角五六分至七角、兵船牌祗開六元六角至五角半、聞日粉近期與現貨竟有跌進六元關內者、市面每多參差、殊形混沌、査麵粉今日有五百包、運往香港、今日爲雙十節國慶紀念、停市一天、</p>
<p>小麥　前昨小麥來源、尙不湧旺、到貨的計一萬餘包、行販擯守、大戶上棧待售、而廠胃平淡、市難振奮、統市僅由福阜兩廠辦去管店·蘇州·常州·無錫·丹陽·常熱·浦東等麥四千五百包、價爲九元八角至三角七分、市面仍乏軒輊、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗巿跌風加厲　狂落的原因有三</h3>
<p>紗巿續趨下游、且跌風甚熾、良以實需停滯、華南一帶受匯兌嚴厲統制、故近來採辦力量大减、同時棉花售價略見鬆落、致人心愈形衰弱、市塲　碼略見充盈、一般虛浮之多頭、鑒於環境不良、乃忍痛斬結、市價遂下跌允厲、惟實力富裕之戶、團藏之貨、始終不願吐出、情况尙能支持一步、今日爲國慶節、市塲停市一天、</p>
<p>現紗晨開向業相緊、大家仍觀望而不動手、喊聲雖高、然吃客寥寥無幾、盤價一跌十九元、雙馬現貨價爲七百二十元、棧單僅售七百〇五元、中途雖有盤頭、然上下甚微、市態依然疲憊不振、收盤二十支雙馬現貨價爲七百十八元、棧單價爲七百〇一元、查半日問成交七百十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌十一元、雙地球跌二十四元半、天女跌十九元半、十支粗紗亦跌十餘元、廠方由申新廠開出十支紅雙馬一千七百包、價爲五百八十元、茲將現紗各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　五二五　江西　四〇</p>
<p>香港　六〇　寗波　三〇</p>
<p>內地　六〇　統計　七一五</p>
<p>近日紗巿連朝狂落之原因、簡述如左、</p>
<p>（一）內地物價飛騰、已達登峯造極之境、布疋關係民生重大、故昆明當局早已統制矣、</p>
<p>（二）香港當局嚴厲管理匯兌、商人不得擅意將款項向外匯出、至於新加坡等地亦有同樣步驟、於是採辦大受牽掣、所以華南方面交易缺乏最大因素也、二十支雙馬由八百六十元直跌到至七百十八元、</p>
<p>（三）原棉自歐洲軍事爆發以來、船隻稀少、且附加保兵險及水餉、重重之增加、換算價殊昂、因之紗廠成本騰高、本國雖在新棉登塲之祭、然各方運輸旣困難、又不能安全抵滬、故開價出一百〇一元逐步飛騰至一百六十元、近以價高在產區搜羅、冒險運滬者頗不乏人、困此近來到貨據擠貨物一增、巿價當然下降、跌至一百四十一元、兼之變外匯靜而謐、英匯常在四便士半左右、於是有此原因、一般積鬰一久之空額、紛紛活動、復來洩恨、巿盤由此乃一蹶不振矣、前途究屬如何、還在實際方面着想也、</p>
<h3>來源不斷　通花再跌</h3>
<p>本棉交易轉靜、緣紗巿不振、廠胃閉塞、同時通花常陰沙來源繼續不斷、因此售價下降、通州花再小三四元、同業中鑒於以上情况、亦袖手不動辦、於是成交大爲减縮、蘇北來源、到通州花二千零九十二包、常陰沙一千一百二十包、又北沙來六百二十包、茲將現棉售盤列後、</p>
<p>新通花　一四一·〇〇　同業　七〇〇包</p>
<p>巴西　一七五·〇〇　同業　二〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來因滙兌堅挺、各方對於外棉之購置、槪抱觀望、因之交易頗爲靜寂、昨日白洛區因通州來貨擁到之故、祇售一百六十三元云、</p>
<p>外棉巿價、紐約棉巿、晨初頗爲堅而靜、遠東交易亦屬良好、後又因南方帮在巿猛烈套賣、及多頭乘機了結、巿况因而轉疲、結果收盤價格較之上日跌二三磅音、印度棉巿、日來因遠東略有問訊者、因之巿况頗形活躍、昨日連同預測漲二羅比、埃及跌十餘磅音、利物浦停巿、</p>

<p>兩性衛生</p>
<h3>第二性特徵　及靑春發動期須知</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>人類男女幼童，生長至一定年齡後，其睪丸或卵巢始有成熟的精子或卵子排出於外，在女性爲月經的來潮，在男性卽是遺精現象的發生，這種發育成熟的時期，卽所謂春情發動期。視人租和環境等等之不同，春情發動期之遲早亦各異；塞未的克種人較早，歐人稍遲，熱帶人民最早，寒帶最遲；生於奢侈淫逸之人較早，生於窮困憂抑之人較遲。就男女兩性言之，春情發動期之遲早亦不一致，女性必較早於男性，普通女性之春情發動期，的在十三至十五歲，男性的在十四至十六歲。在女性四十二至五十歲時，排卵停止，稱此時爲月經閉止期。男性至六十歲以上之高年，仍有射精可能者，此當視春情期衛生的優劣爲斷。蓋有的未至中年，其射精機能卽吿衰退，此因春情期荒淫自瀆，性慾早衰故也。</p>
<p>男女至春情發動期，其生殖器部卽發生顯著的變化。自有生以來向在靜止狀態的生殖器，此時一如冬整的昆虫，遇到日暖風和的春天，漸漸蘇醒起來，全部生殖器充血，體積增大。男性生殖器時有勃起現象及遺精；女性開始月經來潮。但實際上不僅此生殖器部有變化，卽兩性的整個身體與心理，亦有特殊變化，此變化現象之總稱，卽爲「第二性徵」。人類之美及女性之美，皆發源於第二性徵。</p>
<p>靑春發動期亦爲吾人最危險之時期，蓋靑年每於此時受生理的衝動而性慾亢進，作種種　傷身心的行爲，如荒淫自瀆，則精血枯竭，遺精早洩，腦弱腎虧，逐一爆發，爲求健康計，此時應服以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以補之，功能補血生精，健腦固腎，久服能返老還童。蓋補體康眞正採取少壯動物之睪丸精紫並摻入補腦之燐質製成，故滋補力大而且週，其女用有調經種子，治貧血不妊之功。</p>
<p>花柳病毒</p>
<h3>何法可以征服淋病</h3>
<p>— 美國醫　學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>淋病之療法衆多，有注射，有電療，有器械等療法，不一而足，皆各有利幣，不能稱之爲完全療法。一般醫家，對於內服藥，亦多注意，蓋內服藥應用便利，苟其效用優良，則爲征服淋病之利器。因其他療法，多須醫師行之，其效不廣。惟內服藥中，其功效確切者，又屬罕見。近來雖有透膜殺菌療法，亦不過作用於局部，不能視作根治之實效也。邇日各國醫界中甚行一種白血球療法，其神效至足驚人，考其學理，則因增加白血球、而噬菌與抗淋之力量猛增、於是不論爲潛伏於何種部份，或留居血中之淋菌，無不根本肅淸，而一切頑强之淋病，遂完全奏凱而根治矣。</p>
<p>德國彼德博士，復根據此學理，採用蛋白體黃色素等混合製成「克淋儂」一藥，服後能旺盛白血球，以增進抗淋殺菌力，而奏根治之功。凡一切急慢性淋病，一經服用此劑，立奏殊功，而得逐步根除，其治愈之成績，恒占百分之九十八以上，故「克淋儂」一藥，遂爲各國醫家所賞用也。</p>
<p>余自負笈美利堅返國以還，於淋病之治療，無不極力留意，而於內服藥方面具有特效成績者，亦惟「克淋儂」藥足可當之。凡急性淋時服之能短期中，發生抗淋鎭痛利尿之功，而慢性淋之一切變症，則服「克淋儂」允能將匿處深部之淋菌，完全肅淸，此與一般表面及局部透膜殺菌療法大不相同之點，而同時亦是征服淋毒最有效之武器。</p>
<h3>肺病根治條件</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>國人因衛生智識，不能普及，一般人多因此而染上肺病。因此病極爲緾綿，所以叉印上一種肺病難愈之惡劣印像。其實此種錯誤的覜念，亟須除去，以免反爲病魔所奪。其實肺病亦非如一般醫家所說那樣可怕，而相反的肺病實在個個都可治好，只要醫治和攝生得法，其他並無神秘。此余因二十餘年經騐所得，恒用「補肺拿爾」一藥，以搜癆補肺，鎭咳除痰，塡補肺臟空洞，不論病至二三期時之吐血，服之亦可絕對治愈，不過在治愈期間，宜安靜切勿勞動，並多攝取滋養料之食品，沘爲肺癆必愈之條件。</p>
<h3>手淫意淫的弊害比較</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學　博士鄭霆</p>
<p>手淫爲一種不自然的動作，乃以手或他物摩擦外生殖器，以達到性的快感和洩精的行爲，亦有不用上述方法而僅爲意淫，卽自覺的引起性的想像，以及幻想的快感，於以得洩精或性的滿足者，手淫可以發生於八九歲之幼童，意淫則多數發生於成人，因幼童之想像力尙未充分發達，故不克爲此不自然之精神自瀆也。在靑年人亦有二者並行的，如意淫之想像在先，手淫之動作繼之於後，二者之爲害。可謂相等，意淫之害或允過之，因意淫純爲精神之想像，精神久受此不自然的刺激後，極易釀成神經衰弱及其他精神病。</p>
<p>不論自瀆及意淫，凡行之過度，腦力虧損，精神消耗，發育不良，甚之生殖機能萎縮，如早洩陰痿，不妊等症，一一爆發，如此則健康失常，生命堪虞矣。爲補救計，靑年人之手淫與意淫！速宜戒除，有遺精者速宜制止，最對症的藥劑，莫如服以德國遺精專藥「耐而斯遺精片」以鞏固精關，滋補大腦，使睡眠安適，夢遺可免，同時兼以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以補虧損，促進發育，兩藥同服，見效允速。</p>
<p>淋病座談</p>
<h3>剷除頑强之淋毒</h3>
<p>— 姚菊醫師撰　診所：寗波路　九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋毒妓十足頑强而不易治愈之花柳病，染之者易，治之者難，以是傳播甚廣。惟其所以難愈之原因，多由病家與醫家，不能剖悉病情，妄自猜疑本身之病，是吾獲愈。而以淋絮是吾淸凈爲決，實屬誤事。蓋淋病並不是以尿液澄淸與吾，爲淋病根治之證，原來淋菌一物體積至小，非目力所能察視而得之，大抵淋毒一過急性，其分泌液必减少，但不可視爲淋病漸愈之微，語其實，此乃爲淋病的一種轉變？卽淋菌乘吾人忽路之際，潛伏深人，待機而動，凡患者偶一勞動，或偶涉房事，尿液又轉　濁，淋系則又點滴如浮絮，如此輾轉，病態變化莫測，故慢性攝護腺炎，精阜炎，精囊炎，睪丸炎，膀胱炎等，莫不由於病家與醫家失治蹉跎而來今欲根本肅消此項淋菌，自非徹底加以治療不爲功，必須實行除毒務盡之政策，若仍存隨發隨治之姑息療法，及局部手術，絕無根治之希望。余廿年來，對於淋病醫治，無藥不試，無法不用，而要求淋病之根本解決，一勞永逸者，非實行德國靜電療法，與內服淋病聖藥「克淋儂」不可。因「克淋儂」能抗殺深部之淋菌、而靜電療法更有使「克淋儂」迅速發揮殺菌作用，並能在淺部粘膜等處之淋菌，徹底根木肅淸之偉效，一經治　，永無再發之例。診時時：上午十時至下午六時每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並送價値一元之「性病全書」一册。</p>

<h3>億定盤路一帶　日軍挨戶搜查</h3>
<p>二日人昨闖入私立女中　紛擾多時卒遭拘八捕房</p>

<h3>蘇州河北　英軍增强防務　滙司捕房增派探捕加緊巡邏　日軍嚴查通行證一華人被扣</h3>
<p>今日爲國慶紀念、蘇州河北甲區英日警備界綫英軍、昨起增强防務、匯司捕房亦派捕加緊巡邏、工作殊緊、日便衣人員、往來不絕於途、北江西路兩缺口日軍、奕嚴查通行華人、昨有男子一名因遺失派司、致遭日軍扣留、茲誌各情如决、</p>
<p>甲區界綫　英軍警備</p>
<p>駐滬英軍當局、鑒於今日爲我中國國慶紀念、深恐不法之徒、乘機滋事、爲決意執行防守區內警備工作、維持治安起見、除已分飭駐滬各防區部屬注意戒備外、並於昨日派出蘇格蘭兵十餘名、乘軍用車馳赴北河南路錢業會館之防守處、增雄防守力量、深夜均分佈沿路一帶、以維該區治安、</p>
<p>滙司捕房　加緊巡邏</p>
<p>該甲區地帶、英日防區雖有改變、但自北江西路以西全部警權仍屬於海寗路匯司捕房、該捕房於昨日下午增派中西巡捕分別沿路逡巡、每一交叉路口、均有巡捕佇立、並增派巡捕在北江西路橋堍南北兩端巡守、一若未變防區前之狀態、逡巡工作殊緊、益顯該捕房對甲區警權、絕未輕視、</p>
<p>華人一名　竟遭扣留</p>
<p>大光社記者昨日下午曾赴該甲區巡視、行至海寗路缺口附近時、適見有男女兩人、來自虹口、擬由該缺口走出、日軍向之索騐通行證、因該男子祇餘派司套一只、派司則不知何時遺失、故情極恐慌、當向日軍求恕無效、竟被扣留、迄一時餘、猶未釋放、結果如何未詳、</p>
<p>三查戶口　情形緊張</p>
<p>該甲區日軍、對於對於鐵絲網外地區、巳連日派便衣日軍往來探視行人、昨日下午、允多加緊、似對於中國國慶日、有所防備、並在該鐵絲網內一帶、連續作第一二三次戶口調査、居戶不勝其煩、業已紛請遷出、惟日軍對於居民遜出一節、竟不予准許、故旣經遷入而不得遷出者、祇徒喚奈何而已、又聞日來虹口一帶、日軍防守、情形極爲緊張、</p>

<h3>英美郵輪　定期到滬</h3>
<p>大英公司蒲登號　由英倫經港駛滬</p>
<p>美國總統輪船公司、克利扶倫總統號、此决由洛杉磯開來遠東、因起程時照規定之船期、略有延緩、以致今日不能到滬、聞現改於十五日抵埠十六日赴香港·小呂宋、鴨家公司中印綫、班輪薩蓆亞（譯音）號、已於前日七日抵滬、停靠浦東其昌棧、該輪儎來、由英來華之乘客十餘人、係原乘大英公司蘭普拉號來滬、該輪抵喀爾喀搭後、即返棹回英、乃改乘薩蓆亞號來滬、該輪在滬客貨、亦已裝卸完畢、定今日起椗、開往日本而赴香港、回返喀爾喀搭、又大英公司、歐亞綫正班郵船蒲登號、業於英倫起程來華、聞今日抵港、明日由港來滬、的十三日可到滬、叉該公司經理之尼洛Nellore號、行駛新金山錢、定明日到滬、</p>
<h3>滇越鐵路恢復通車　快車貨車不日亦可開行　國內段關金重合越幣價</h3>
<p>滇越鐵路中國段於上月二十六日被水冲毀路基、交通驟吿中斷、經該鐵路局積極修理、已可勉强恢復開駛慢車、惟在徐家渡澂江以來、旅客須下車步行、然後換車、行程較平日遭一日（平時需時三日）、至快車及貨車現仍在停頓狀態中、但不日即可恢復、又關於該路車票票價、因該路之國內段與越南段之幣制各異、（國內段以關金爲單位越南段以越幣爲單位）且各該單位時有漲落、致票價亦增减不定、據該路局最近規定、每一關金合越幣二元八角（平日僅合二元四角）、因此票價亦隨之增漲、最近由海防至昆明之頭等單位票價爲越幣八十七元四角一分、二等五十九元二角七分、三等三十四元二角五分、四等十一元八角八分、邇來外匯飛漲、每一越幣伸國幣三元五角餘、車票所費、更所不資、則對於一般經越而赴內地之旅客、更加一重負擔矣、</p>
<h3>米價昨又見跌　上巿達一萬石　巿塲情形依然看小　但運輸權仍操日手</h3>
<p>本年雨水調勻、江浙兩省產米區、如無錫常熟靑浦朱家角松江嘉興嘉善平湖等各地、禾稻均吿豐收、較之去年的增二三成、而各地早稻登塲後、因滬市價格高貴、故內地米糧有大量到滬、昨日到埠者內河計十一船共二千七百三十石、陸路共三十車計三千七百五十石、數量已較上週增加十分之三四、昨日上市者除二千七百三十石外、尙有五千三百八十四包、總計竟達一萬石、實爲入秋以來所未有、因供過於求、故價格依然回跌、計江北秈跌的七角、羅秈跌的一元、洋秈跌五角、粳米跌一元、各檔較之最高峯時、已跌十元、惟市塲情形依然看小、故成交數僅及到貨之半、至集團訂購洋米、登記雖達六萬包之多、惟目下江北秈僅十八元五角、最好粳米亦祇三十二元、照目下外匯結價、已較梗米爲昂、訂購洋米、已非事實所必要、故決暫緩進行、</p>
<p>日方依然　操縱米價</p>
<p>全市各棧存米、工部局每星期舉行調查一决、連日因到貨轉旺、銷路呆滯、故洋棧存貨亦隨之增加、上週各棧存糧較前一星期的增一萬包　石、江北泰興泰州如皋姜堰等地、前因米價低廉、故米商紛往採辦、惟連日在跌後、運滬後已難占利、故米商已往就近採辦粳米、因此本市米價、近期內當能跌近限價、民食前途、更可無憂、惟前日有內地到滬十三米船、開至蘇州河西段、被日方扣留、旋經多方設法、始得放行、是以食米來源通塞與吾、悉由日方隨時決定、何者應扣、何者應放行、並無一定標準、米業對此、亦徒喚奈何而已、</p>
<p>斛司要求　越出範圍</p>
<p>全市米業斛司因要求豆米業公會將長江帮運滬米糧、亦須代扣斛力一分事、迄今延未解決、據談、豆米業向分南北兩帮、杭嘉湖靑浦朱家角等產地爲南帮、崑常蘇錫等地爲北帮、此兩帮產地米糧、均由民船裝載來申、故名曰「河下貨」、戰前斛司斛力、每石計錢二十四文（合八厘）、自抗戰軍興、河下貨運輸困難、故均改由火車運輸、因此由散艙改爲包裝、每包計一石二斗餘、因斤量數已規定、無須再用斛司、然滬上業此斛司者、雖由行家雇用、但祇有飯吃而無工錢、今因此包裝而完全失業、生活當然不能維持、公會爲顧念此輩生活計、故在此非常時期、不論包裝船載、祇要自南北帮產米、雖或經由長江裝載輪船來滬、每一百六十斤仍代扣斛力一分、以資救濟、爲數亦甚可觀、今斛司不明公會內部組織、要求由長江帮裝運來滬之米糧、亦須由會通吿同業、代扣每石一分、則公會無此權力、蓋此不在公會範圍之內也、所謂長江帮產地、係江北蕪湖南京等地、向由長江火輪船裝載、稱量而不稱石、故無用斛司、亦無斛力「此係安徽鎭江蕪湖南京等各帮行客採辦、屬於雜糧業同業公會、斛司越出此範圍之要求、惟有詳爲解釋、並登報公吿社會、</p>
<h3>印度三靑年　暢述游踪</h3>
<p>定期離滬赴港　願與滬人見面　　印度三靑年、乘脚踏車旅行全球、道經上海、各情已誌本報、茲該印度靑年等發表談話云、我們自從在祖國攻讀完畢、曾下幾年的工夫、努力去幹我們的事業、除一個做保險業經紀外、其餘都做着電器工程師、我們在受職時期、老早便抱着滿腔熱望、的定共同預</p>
<p>信些金錢</p>
<p>作旅行全球的壯舉、經過幾年以後、還算不失所望、計算儲金的數量、儘足供應旅行中兩年用度、至於兩年後的旅費來源、我們祇好立定主意、向所經各地去演說·投稿·電台播音·或將我們的著作賣出、來維持旅途上生活、可是願每違心、我們才渡過</p>
<p>十四個月</p>
<p>旅程、至英國不多久、兩年用度却完了、自此以後、我們祇有貫澈先前主張掙扎下去、我們在一九三三年四月裏、由孟買坐上脚踏車動程的時候、祖國的時局、是異常地惡劣的、它雖然給不景氣範罩着、我們始終要本着我們的精神、向我們志向的前途邁進、自不愁在國外我不到噉飯地、也不怕各界人士不給於</p>
<p>良好同情</p>
<p>我們這回旅行的本意、並不祇冒着險這麼單純、同時我們要把祖國文物到處宣揚、使世人多所認識、我們總覺得旅行對於國際間和個人好感、是很容易增加的、所以我們每到達一處演說或播音、都堅決地把聽衆對印度的懷疑和誤會</p>
<p>詳加解釋</p>
<p>同時、我們更要將所經各地不同的風物翔實地紀載着、预备将来在復国时、把一切感想都向我們同胞詳爲報吿、我們自從離開了風土、已經踏過了四萬英里的程途、所經過的國度、有阿富汗·波斯·土耳其·巴爾幹諸國、匈牙利·奥大利·捷克·德意志·比利士·英吉利·爱爾蘭·法蘭西·西班牙·瑞士·而由埃及至</p>
<p>菲洲南部</p>
<p>並由那裏渡過大西洋而達巴西·巴拿馬·占米加·古巴·墨西哥·美利堅·加拿大、再涉太平洋而至日本、到達上海後、我們預定耍南下香港、才轉赴菲律濱·澳洲·烏絲崙·爪哇·蘇門答臘·星加坡·馬來亞殖民地·暹羅和緬甸各地、希望在一九四三年可以</p>
<p>趕回祖國</p>
<p>我們所感覺、至爲失望的、恰巧中國現正在離亂時期、沒有跑到內地觀光的機會、然而我們仍在希望着中華烽烟早熄、相的重來巡禮、我們前頭說過、我們這回旅行不祗是冒着險這麽單純的、但在梯山航海八年當中、自然也遭遇着不少的危難、比方在阿富汗沙漠上着迷了三天才得遇救、在波斯的北都、寄所在淸早給</p>
<p>積雪壓陷</p>
<p>了、我們費了許多工夫、才能開挖小路逃生、像在土耳其境內、被當局疑爲偵探、扣留了十五天才得省釋、在西非利加洲整整二十一個月頭、險死還生的、最低限度要遭逢過二十一次、他如野獸的追逐、急流棘林的險阻、溽暑苦寒的襲迫、那更不勝其數了、我們</p>
<p>現在上海</p>
<p>逗遛着些時、也希望有和各界見面的機會、倘有甚麽會所或其他團體、想聽取我們族程上所閱歷的一切、便請到天主堂街二十九號白頭總會賜敎、或撥電話第八六七七六號、自會和我們接錢的、我們打算在本月十七日便要起程到香港去了、順便附及、</p>

<h3>「歹土」中暴徒橫行　賭窟勞業慘淡　僞「禁烟局」苛捐重稅　烟館營業亦大受打擊</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、記者於星期六日夜赴滬西視察所悉、賅區惡風、現因法紀蕩然而漸歸消沉、「歹土」且成「死土」矣、該區中暴徒、有附屬於「大道警局」之所謂「自衛團」團員者、有「綏靖軍」之便衣士兵者、</p>
<p>橫行無忌</p>
<p>使一度繁榮之「歹土」賭窟內及其四週、恐怖不安、致賭博業一落千丈、嗜賭者對於「大道」方面肅淸「歹土」、及公共租界警務處加嚴宵禁之謠諑、均泰然處之、但發現持械暴徙徘徊四週、實施洗刧時、乃畏縮不敢往賭窟矣、聞此輩暴徒、亦往賭窟賭博、勝則安然離去、負則</p>
<p>在外守候</p>
<p>贏款賭徒而攔刦之、賭窟所雇保鑣、無能爲九、蓋彼等熟知舟加干涉、暴徒即將以槍彈饗之也、暴徒活躍結果、「歹土」之繁榮時日、今已過去矣、著名之好萊塢樂園為該地最大賭窟、星期六日夜唯有輪盤賭一處賭桌四週、有賭徒三四十人而已、另一室中、有番攤兩處、及引</p>
<p>省數賭徒</p>
<p>內有外僑數人各室、除形色沮喪之賭窟雇員外、絕無賭客、吸食雅片者亦寥寥無幾、申園昔爲跑狗塲、嗣改成華人體育中心地、近亦成賭窟矣、其中輪盤賭具雖已備就、惟無往博者、除骰子賭桌」處、四週有賭徒二十人外、其餘各處、無不沉寂、如廢歷新歲時之九江路然、酒肆中</p>
<p>裸體表演</p>
<p>恒吸引顧客數百人者、是夜營業頗爲慘淡、「歹土」中其他宵遊地點、顧客亦頗稀少、沿愚園路一帶之非賭博塲所因該地毫無法紀、兼以美水兵與陸戰隊不得前往、致營業尤形淸淡、「歹土」中情况雖如是、但聞公共租界與法租界中宵遊地點、則營業興盛、「歹土」賭窟對於此種發展、</p>
<p>頗爲震驚</p>
<p>聞刻正嚴重考慮吸引賭客之法、其一爲提供多種游藝表演、如兩租界中所不能上演之表演等是、「歹土」中雅片營業、同樣受毫無法紀之影響、烟館除遭持械暴徒之騷擾外、並受「維新政府禁烟局」苛捐重稅之苦、該局辦事處設白利南路康福里五十二號、對於運入「歹土」之雅片、每盎斯</p>
<p>徵費一角</p>
<p>該局並規定各烟館之售烟限額，若售烟較上月爲少、則烟館主應負局方收入低落之責、而被重處罰鍰、</p>

<h3>新中國在鬥爭中生長着</h3>
<p>— 德音</p>
<p>中國現已覺醒</p>
<p>今日的中國正在遭受着空前的苦難。然而除却少數的例外，每一個中國人都日益增强了民族的自信。大家覺得爲要爭求民族的獨立和自由，任何重大的必耍的代價總是値得支付的。而且事實證明着，覺醒的新中國雖在侵略者極度的摧殘之下終究是日益發榮滋長了。</p>
<p>由於辛亥革命推動</p>
<p>這一種民族覺醒的現象是從辛亥革命開始的。辛亥革命的成功表示着在全世界佔有重要地位的中國決不是沒出息的快要沒落的國家。它再受不住帝國主義的欺凌，要獨立自由地求着發展了。帝國主義列强，雖然嫉視着中國革命勢力的膨脹，可是迫於事勢，也就不得不承認當時的共和政府。民國成立以來道二十八年的歷史，一方面反映着列强在華勢力的鈎心鬥角，在另一方面則表示着中國民族革命勢力對帝國主義鬥爭的繼續。</p>
<p>在帝國主義中間，對中國壓迫得最厲害的不消說就是日本帝國主義。中國近代史上最痛心的幾種國恥全是日本帝國主義所賜予的。歷史的運命規定着：日本帝國主義由於勃興時期的落後又由於地理形勢的限制，必然要採取征服中國的目標。因這緣故，中國的革命不能跟對日的鬥爭分離，而中國革命的主要任務也就是摧毀日本帝國主義。中山先生革命運動的發端，即與中會的創立適在中日戰爭的前一年，這實在並不能說是全然出於偶然的。</p>
<p>偉大的潛在力</p>
<p>日本帝國主義對中國侵略的主意是在日韓合併當時早就定下的了。著名的田中奏摺上就明明白白規定着；日本要採取大陸政策，先從滿蒙入手，然後以軍事的威脅使全中國的人民因「風靡」而屈服。換句話說就是要滅亡中國。然而四萬五千萬的中國人民是有偉大的潛在力量的。由於革命先覺者們不絕的奔走呼號，中國的人民一天比一天地覺醒起來，團結起來。七年以前，日木以武力奪取了東四省，可是中國人民遠出日本軍閥主義者的意料，不但絕未因之而「風靡」反而把抗戰的意志愈益變得堅强了。蘆溝橋的砲聲終於成了全國抗戰的號砲。日本帝國主義只得陷入戰爭的泥淖了。</p>
<p>優越武器已失其效</p>
<p>在兩年餘的戰爭期間，日本帝國主義憑籍着武器優越固然佔據了中國許多沿交通幹綫的城市，然而要控制離交通幹綫略遠的地區，用盡力量也一無辦法。同時日本國內的經濟則因戰事的持久日益衰竭下去。最近湘北戰敗以後，日本軍人對於繼續進攻的力量，當然愈益失却自信了</p>
<p>中國已取到主動的地位</p>
<p>至於中國，則軍事方面中國軍隊漸漸取得了主動的反攻的優勢，政治方面，全國上下齊心協力擁護抗戰，經濟方面，中國政府的國際信用日見鞏固，後方建設也日見進步。凡此種種都足證明中國的抵抗力，隨着抗戰的進展一天比一天加强了。</p>
<p>獨立和自由的目標對於中國，無論如何是漸漸地接近了。然而古人有句話：「行百里者半九十。」來日的鬥爭還是異常艱難的。每一個中國人都得站在本身的崗位上加倍努力着才好。</p>
<h3>辛亥革命的回憶</h3>
<p>— 王伯祥</p>
<p>一，革命的序幕消朝晚年，外侮緊迫，吏治腐敗，一般愛國之士都想發奮自强。他們因觀點不同分爲兩大派：一派主張「立憲救國」，一派主張「民族革命」。淸廷迫於情勢，不得不贊成立憲，反對革命，結果却由「假立憲」而引起了「眞革命」來。</p>
<p>革命黨的舉事，自光緒二十二年（一八九六）廣州之役始。主持其事的，便是孫總理。其後歷經惠州鎮南關河口及廣州二决革命諸役，革命黨雖屢决失敗，而勇氣不衰，卒乘川漢鐵路收回國有的風潮中，在武昌首義。</p>
<p>二，武漢首義與各省響應</p>
<p>辛亥年陰歷八月十九日（即一九一一年十月十日）武昌工程營第八營左隊的革命黨人首先發難。翌晨分兵下漢陽漢口，推舉陸軍第二十」混成協統領官黎元洪爲「中華民國軍政府那軍大都督。」這樣居中一呼，四方響應甚速，不過幾個月工夫，各省便紛紛宣吿光復了。</p>
<p>三，漢陽的失陷與南京的攻克</p>
<p>武漢起義後，淸廷即派遣海陸軍來攻，至二十七日雙方開始戰鬥，淸軍大敗，沿鐵路綫北退。及接得袁世凱將要南下督師的消息，情形乃爲之一變，因淸軍的南遺部隊都是袁氏舊屬，一聞故帥重臨，勇氣自然驟振，便於九月初六日復與民軍作戰，藉兵艦之助，攻入漢口大智門，動手搶掠，繼以焚燒。當時民軍退守漢陽，至九月二十六日開始渡漢水，與淸軍砲戰，旅進旅退。二十八日海軍各艦俱已反正，發砲助戰，淸軍之勢大挫。剛巧袁世凱在北京組成新內閣，嚴令淸軍進取漢陽，反守爲攻，九月初三初四初五連日血戰，至初七日下午漢陽復爲淸軍所得，遂得挾龜山的巨砲時時隔江轟擊武昌，武昌全市盡入火綫之內，形勢岌岌。幸民軍攖城固守，過不了四五日長江下游的根本重地—南京—又爲民軍所攻克，於是民軍的基礎又臻鞏固，到了浙江江蘇二省相繼光復之後，民軍之於中國，已到了「三分天下有其二」的地位了。</p>
<p>四，臨時政府的建立</p>
<p>湖北都督府鑒於光復各省，人自爲政，沒有進行的聯合機關，深爲不便，乃召集各省代表都赴武漢開會，假漢口英租界的順昌洋行爲會所。十月初十日開第一次會議，十三日議決臨時政府組織大綱，即日公布。十四日聞南京克復消息，即議決以南京爲臨時政府所在地。至二十一，二十二，二十三等日各省代表齊集南京，十一月初十日開選舉臨時大總統會。到會代表十七省，共計十七票，孫總理獨得十六票，富選爲中華民國臨時大總統。孫總理於十一月十三日入南京就職。那天恰是陽歷的一月一日，臨時政府既決定採用陽歷，便以孫總統就職之日爲中華民國元年的元旦。</p>
<p>歷史片段</p>
<h3>黨國要人　在辛亥大革命時代</h3>
<p>辛亥革命，到了目前，雖巳二十有八年，可是目前抗戰中的軍政要人，大都仍是那時致力民族革命的人物。當此雙十節國慶紀念到來的時候，我們翻翻過去的歷史，把二十八年前現負黨國重任的軍政要人在那時革命的光榮史摘述一二出來，想亦讀者所樂聞吧。</p>
<p>林主席　辛亥革命後，臨時政府成立時，林先生被推爲參議院議長。</p>
<p>蔣委員長　武昌起義，蔣先生適在日本，爲士官候補生，任高田騎兵第十七聯隊附。那時他早已爲中華同盟會會員。聽到革命消息後、即與同志返上海，投入革命怒潮中，創立協濟會，身負籌劃軍費之責。並兼滬軍第五團長，率兵轉戰於浙江各地。</p>
<p>馮玉祥　辛亥革命時，馮先生正任淸軍第八十標三營管帶，受第二十鎭統制陳宦管轄，駐防京奉路湯河。武昌起義後，密謀響應民軍獨立，惜未達目的。</p>
<p>于右任　辛亥革命時，于先生仍爲報人，辦民立報及神州日報，宜傳革命甚力。民元一月，南京臨時政府成立，被任爲交通次長。</p>
<p>李烈鈞　辛亥革命時，李先生與蔡鍔唐繼堯二人共謀雲南獨立，後復返其本省江西，任同盟會江西支部長，爲江西獨立運動奔走，率領江西的北伐軍，任湖北救援軍司令。</p>

<p>王正廷　辛亥革命後，以奔走南北和議，曾爲湖北軍政府的外交處長。</p>
<p>閻錫山　辛亥革命時，閻先生爲山西新軍四十三協統領，駐防山西，與同志在山西省城太原發動，響應革命。並把那時山西巡撫陸鍾琦擊斃，被推爲山西都督，宣布山西獨立。同時復派兵至娘子關，堵防淸軍侵人山西。</p>
<p>馬君武　辛亥革命時，爲廣西代表，赴南京，盡瘁於臨時政府的組織。</p>
<p>蔡元培　辛亥革命時，蔡先生由日本歸上海，參與民軍之樞機，南京臨時政府成立後，被推爲顧問。</p>
<p>孫科　亥革命時，孫總理在歐，而孫哲生先生則在美國三番市·在美曾有宣言，謂中國建立共和國後，投票選舉之權，當悉按敎育程度而定，婦女亦須予以選舉植云。</p>
<p>沈鈞儒　號稱七君子之一的沈先生，辛亥革命時，任浙江軍政府交涉使。</p>
<h3>辛亥革命時之　女革命軍</h3>
<p>— 浣</p>
<p>辛亥革命史中，不乏巾幗英雄，秋瑾女士其最著者也。其次如上海有薛素貞女士曾領導尙俠女校學生，組織女國民軍，上呈陳都督其美，請予批准，其呈詞中略謂：「伊古以來，娘子成軍，宮人敎陣；木蘭代父，良玉佐夫，歷史傳爲美談，後人未容多讓。比者楚歌一聲，義旗四舉，上海爲通商巨埠，都督乃應運挺生；商民結敢死之團，學界起先鋒之隊。夫一國興亡，匹婦亦肩責任，茲發起女國民軍，一切如男國軍民辦法，詳細規則，當俟批准遵訂奉呈。丁廿世紀風潮之衝，舞台與鬚眉分佔；振五千年文弱之敞，國魂偕織手同招。」云云。越數日，率女生代表詣都督府求見，陳都督以軍書旁午，當委招待員面詢一切，是晚九時即行批覆，准許組織。批示云：「批閱簡章，具見女子愛國不讓男兒，使巾幗中人盡如君等，何患不雄飛世界。今旣捐除紅粉，從事黑鐵，娘子軍容，胡兒胆落。……」今也國事蜩螗，前方將士浴血抗戰，凡吾愛國之女同胞閱此，當不讓秋薛專美於前也。少年時代之中山先生</p>

<h3>國慶話洪門</h3>
<p>— 桑楡</p>
<p>繼續踏着先烈的血跡　造成未來光榮的歷史</p>
<p>從中華民國的開國史料裏我們可以我到創造中華民國的諸先烈與舊日秘密會黨共同奮鬥的許多實例。最重要的幾件事如興中會與哥老會的關係這兩個會有一度曾經合併，孫中山先生任會長。（民國紀元前十二年）美國致公堂於紀元前八年在舊金山舉行全體大會歡迎孫總理，並尊稱爲孫大哥。黃花崗之舉是締造中華民國最有力的一决革命運動，這决運動的經費的半數，是加拿大致公堂會友的，那時候因爲臨時增加費用，各會友凑數不足，甚至變賣公私產業捐助革命。這三件事是洪門會友參加革命最著名的事件。此外如黃克强秋瑾陳少白等在中國革命史上是開國元勳，同時也是三點會的「龍頭」與「紈扇」等，也是極著名的。其實呢，我們倘若翻開中華民國開國史前後三十餘年，大小二百數十决的起義，幾乎沒有一决沒有秘密會社分子參加的，並且他們在每次中都是極有力的鬥士。那時候的秘密會社雖然名目很多，如三點會，哥老會等，而總名是洪門會黨。</p>
<p>洪門會黨的分子盡是革命員嗎？參加革命的洪門會黨員盡是爲着締造民國的嗎？那到也未必盡然。這裏有二段歷史引抄如下：</p>
<p>「……李雲彪等以興中會等供給不周，未滿所欲，適以康有爲自南洋至港，欲因以爲用，贈李等各百金，李等以康富有，遂與發生關係，畢永年（按畢先生爲孫中山唐才常諸先生的知友）責以大義，無效，乃憤然作厭世想，竟投菩陀，削髮爲儈，李等後助唐才常經營漢口發難事件，未幾亦以索資不遂，宣吿分裂……」（中華民國開國史上編一五九頁）</p>
<p>從這段史實裹，我們可以我出洪門會友中也有貪財，賣友，甚至忘却大義的叛徒。至少這位李先生是如此。但是，辛亥革命終究因英勇的洪門會友的同情與援助而發動，更因此而締造我們中華民族的億萬年的中華民國，幾個叛徒的醜行，眞好比一點烏雲浮過皎潔的月光，地球上的人們雖然有幾秒點的陰暗，但是決不會發生大作用的。</p>
<p>現在，中華民國又遭遇着大時代了，全國國民都應該獻身這個大時代，爲中華民族獨立自由而奮鬥。我們謹以至誠，祝禱全國的秘密會社友們，每個人都循着孫中山黃克强陳少白畢永年秋瑾諸先烈的光榮史跡而猛進，千萬勿蹈李雲彪的故徹。</p>

<p>革命史話</p>
<h3>因中國革命紀念想到　法國大革命的歷史</h3>
<p>— 方企</p>
<p>憂患足以興邦　我們正可借鑑</p>
<p>二十八年來的國慶日，有好多决是在憂患中渡過的，但任何國家，都不免有憂患，這使我們要想到別國又有多少在憂息中過國慶的日子。</p>
<p>今年是法國革命的一百五十年的紀念，我們就試一查考這有很長的歷史的紀念日吧。手頭沒有充分的參考資料——恐怕也未必有這樣現成的資料——無法確說某年紀念日的情形，只當略舉當時的大勢。可是最有關的也正是大勢吧？</p>
<p>共和紀念日離現在雖已一百五十年，但法國在共和政治下渡過的還不過八十五年而已。衝破巴士狄監獄是在一七八九年，但不曾立即推翻法王，第一共和是一七九二年才成立的，算延續到拿破崙稱帝爲止也只十二年。第一帝國和復辟的王朝統治了四十四年，一八四八年又出現了第二共和，這迄未實際民主的共和名義地維持了四年，路易拿破崙襲他叔父的故技，又由執政而稱帝，以迄一七七〇年色當之役的被據。第三共和在一八七一年成立，迄至現在，是六十九年。</p>
<p>範圍不容許自一七八九以來，逐年叙說，專檢有大事的年代也許不免有選擇上的偏見，所以姑就每逢十年紀念的年代來觀察。</p>
<p>一七九九年。這年仍在共和國的政治團的統治下，但因其腐敗，巳臨崩潰了。拿破崙在近東進行他不認失敗的戰爭，國內正受三國的新同盟來進攻的威脅。狼狽回國的拿破崙，次年倒順利地奪到政權。</p>
<p>一八〇九年。拿破崙執政後的第十年，稱帝後的第六年了。他正打勝對奥的瓦格蘭之一戰，刧娶了奧國公主。</p>
<p>一八一九年。波旁朝的君主，因爲王娃被暗殺，正進行反動的統治。</p>
<p>一八二九年。查理第十的統治，極端反動。人民不安到極點，下一年的七月革命的危機，已經成熟。</p>
<p>一八三九年。正是七月革命至二月革命的中期，這年的季節團的暴動，在二十年內斷續的動亂中不算是小的。二</p>
<p>一八四九年。二月革命，恐怖的六月的後一年。路易拿破菕做着總統，但這時已控制了立法會議，開始壓迫共和派了。</p>
<p>一八五九年。拿破崙第三正進行縱橫捭闔。助意抗奥，旋又撤消援助，就在這年。</p>
<p>一八六九年。普法戰爭的前一年，第三共和國成立的前二年。</p>
<p>一八七九年。前一年的衆議員選舉，共和派大佔優勢。本年遂排去本即暗圖復辟的總統麥克馬昂，共和初見穩定。</p>
<p>一八八九年。共和百年紀念，作爲紀念點綴的，有世界博覽會，埃佛爾鐵塔。波蘭惹將軍鼓吹對德報復，聯俄制德的外交正開始。波蘭惹雖因復辟嫌疑在九一年自殺，法俄的同盟却終於九三年結成，這對法國的從此擴充勢力極有關係。</p>
<p>一八九九年。法國橫斷非洲大陸的雄圖，因法紹達事件受了挫折，但向摩洛哥的進展却得到認可。特萊浮斯的案件正在平反中，由這遂展開了以後幾年淸除敎會勢力的政策。</p>
<p>一九〇九年。保守的克雷孟梭內閣坍台，急進的勢力抬頭，但殖民地事件方面和德國的衝突，使急進派調和德國的企圖無從開始，本年法德對第二决摩洛哥事件的條約，徒引起德人的欲望。</p>
<p>一九一九年。六月二十八日凡爾賽條約簽字。民族主義膨脹到連對克雷孟梭也嫌激進，政權遂轉入更保守的樸因開雷手中。</p>
<p>一九二九年。世界經濟衰落開始。</p>
<p>一九三九年。又一决長期世界大戰嗎。</p>
<p>明年的國慶，大家要不要還在戰爭中紀念？</p>
<p>辛亥革命各省起事獨立及主持人表</p>
<p>此爲各省代表於辛亥改革之際羣集上海由上海商學會招待之攝影。亦即十七省臨時代表之初步組織爲臨時政府之母體者也。座中有江蘇張審浙江湯壽潛及當時上海商會周金箴。</p>
<p>此爲民國四年黃興親筆函件，其時因袁世凱已有稱帝叛國積極行動，黃留居美國特函致辛亥參與開國之役諸公者，黃氏文學優良書法精良爲遺墨中之珍品。</p>

<p>讀書剳記</p>
<h3>先烈詩鈔　忠義之氣家國之恨　讀之足以令人感憤</h3>
<p>總理曾說過：「革命者只有兩條出路，一爲成功，一爲成仁。」辛亥革命前，抱殺身成仁，舍生取義精神因而犧牲其生命的，爲數實在不少。這些志士，有的是出身世家，有的曾留學外國，有的且在明會上有優越的地位，然而他們仍不顧慮他們的父母妻子，地位榮虛，以及個人的生命，臨難不屈，爲國捐軀，這一方而是表現他們認識革命必須犧牲自已的大道理，一方面也在爲國民作表率，以喚起同情與共鳴。所以這些志士中，有幾個人雖不以詩文見稱於世，然而偶一涉筆，必激昂慷慨，深足感人。例如黃花崗七十二烈士中的羅仲霍感懷詩云，「十年浪走天涯路，閱歷多時憂患深。敢說處囊能見末，幾經投爨孰聞音？爲懷家國頻揮淚，不了恩仇未稱心，讀罷離騷三五遍，劍光燈影兩沉沉。」又一首云：「十年恨不早焚書，閱歷浮名盡子虛。未許豪奴共肝膽，苦無善價賣頭顱，關前戰馬胡塵起，海內片雲大刧禍。安得美人具俠骨。香囊寶劍好隨予」。及戊甲在美作一首云：「新亭一掬淚汪汪，哭遍天涯事又傷。四海風雲成浩刧，九霄鴻鴿自翱翔，百年氣燄悲胡虜，萬古精忠痛鄂王，多少奸奴甘賣國，憐予對影吊斜陽。」都極沉痛。</p>
<p>七十二烈士中之又一人黃鍾傑氏，也工詩，其絕命詩之一云云：「久將身世付蟲沙，生死原來祇刹那，大好頭顱向天擲，血中湛出自由花！」尤爲人傳誦。</p>
<p>又如炸龍濟光而遭慘殺的鍾明光烈士，他的自輓詩，也充滿着血淚。今錄其一首如下：「一念酬恩願尙違，卅年心事總堪悲，不才敢擬擎天柱，無地能容立地錐。破國亡家徒有憤，赴湯蹈火義難辭。料應化作啼鵑去，欲報慈烏再世期。」</p>
<p>他如不屑爲蛾眉的秋瑾女士，允多激昂慷慨的作品。茲錄其詩三首如下：感憤詩云：「莽莽神州嘆陸沉，救時無計愧偷生。搏沙有願興亡楚，博浪無椎擊暴秦。國破方知人種滅，義高不碍客褒貧。經營恨來酬同志，把劍悲歌啼淚橫。」又和日人石井君即原韻云：「漫云女子不英雄。萬里乘風獨向東，詩思一帆海空潤，夢魂三島月玲瓏。銅駝已陷悲回首，汗馬終嘶未成功。如許傷心宗回恨，那堪客裏度春風。」又黃海舟中感懷云：「片帆破浪水滄溟，回首河山一髮靑。四壁波濤旋大地，一天星斗橫黃庭。千年刧燼灰全死，十載淘餘水尙腥。海水神仙渺雙霆？天涯涕淚一身零。聞道當年鏖戰地，祇今猶帶血痕流。馳驅戎馬中原夢，破碎河山故國羞，欽海無權悲素寞，磨刀有恨快恩仇。天風吹面冷然過，十萬雲烟眼底收。」秋瑾的胸襟，當然非俗子所能識，而秋瑾的詩，也有「海闊天空」，波洶濤湧的氣概。</p>

<p>名伶軼事</p>
<h3>潘月樵　夏月潤　之革命工作</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>辛亥革命，上海響應甚早，攻製迭局一役，赫於黨史，伶人潘月樵實爲主動之一。今節逢雙十，追懷先烈締造之艱難，於潘公月樵，應宜其史跡，以吿國人及伶界，潘有自傳，曾載報章，文字有缺落，可當史料，今之所記，其軼事耳。</p>
<p>圖左爲潘月樵</p>
<p>少年露頭角</p>
<p>月樵寄居常熟，原籍揚州甘泉縣，父名福雲，生母侯氏，乳名連生，七歲喪父，受嫂虐待，痛苦萬分，九歲能登台唱戲，十六歲時，天仙茶園聘之來滬，一唱即紅，每年包銀一千六百兩，彼時角色每月包銀百餘兩者不多，况在童伶，其受歡迎可知。</p>
<p>二十二年中唱過三百多本新戲</p>
<p>月樵在天仙搭班計唱二十二年之久，演連台鐵公鷄最紅其革命思想蓋已孕於太平天國戲中矣，後改搭丹桂旋與夏氏昆仲合組新舞台於十六舖，排演潘烈士投海等新戲，是時交遊者如姚伯欣等皆商學界領袖人物，革命心志益堅，故辛亥九月有倡攻製造局之舉。</p>
<p>跪地痛哭左足受傷</p>
<p>攻製造局時，潘跪地哭求砲兵開砲，砲彈擊大鐵門不碎，潘登牆求守門者，遂開門，攻克，歸商團公會，知左足傷，流血甚多。</p>
<p>棄伶任旅長七日</p>
<p>岑西林督辦川粵路，委任潘爲鐵路旅長，潘辭新舞台班，赴湖北到任，湖北軍隊多傾向袁世凱有倒戈之勢。潘知不可久留，遂同岑西林怱怱乘船奔滬，計充旅長祗有七天。</p>
<p>改裝和尙脫難</p>
<p>上海二次失敗，潘回常熟養病，鄭汝成派軍警捕之，早數時有人送信通知，急改和尙裝束，逃中峯寺轉滬。</p>
<p>損財八萬晚年困窘</p>
<p>袁氏因下令通緝，獲時就地正法，經藍天蔚黎副總統及常熱上海紳董，各方援救，始取消通緝，家產損失八萬之多，重行登台，先搭丹桂又移九畝地新舞台，（火後重建）包銀之數，祗每年三千元而已，後又往兩廣爲官兩次，民七因吐血回滬，民八逢沈鴻英之變，狼狽而回，速年多病，晚境頽唐，五十八歲時自傳有云，「當押變物，種種困入窘鄕」，英雄末路，亦可哀矣。</p>
<p>附夏月珊夏月潤</p>
<p>夏月恒，月珊，月潤，老伶工夏奎章之子也，月恒壯歲棄伶投端方爲武官，月珊月潤，思想新頴，大胆創作，早主丹桂茶園，後的潘月樵各出資組織十六舖新舞台，排演新戲甚多，得風氣之先，潘月樵率人攻製造局，夏氏昆仲亦助力焉，月珊本習老生，後兼丑角，吾曾見其演濟顚僧，說南方話，滑稽可喜，月潤習武生，娶譚鑫培女，彼向吾親言，赴北平親迎時，老譚令其演戲三日於中和園，實考騐其藝能，堪爲婿吾，第一日演花蝴蝶，上欄杆，大顯身手，輿論翕服，光緒二十七年，彼主丹桂，曾的其岳父演戲，因事齟齬，宣統二年，又約譚氏來滬演於所主之十六舖新舞台，其妻北上接來者也，至民國四年又的譚鑫培演於九畝地新舞台，共演十日，三决的譚，皆姻親關係也，當月潤盛時，爲伶聯會長人呼八老板而不名，儼然上海伶界之王，及其晚年落拓，住閘北淨土庵爲僧，病死庵中，此一二八前半月事也。</p>
<p>剪辮史話</p>
<h3>滿淸陋制積久成俗　國體維新芟夷國恥</h3>
<p>蓄髮辮爲滿淸之陋俗。辛亥光復後，各省軍政府皆通令剪辮。廣東軍政府曾有剪髮令謂：「照得民國已成，與民更始，首滌羶俗。……辮髮者，在漢時爲西南夷之俗，宋時爲女眞之俗，今之滿洲，即女眞別種也。滿淸順治二年乙酉閏六月，再下薙髮令，違者殺無赦。於是吾族皆辮髮垂後。</p>
<p>通令全國剪辮</p>
<p>蓋又至於今矣。我邦人一念辮髮所自來能無亡國之慟？當知我國舊俗，皆總髮爲髻，惟吳越之間，有祝髮者，有剪者，未聞辮髮者也。辮髮非我國之禮，迄自今始，凡我邦人，宜一律剪辮髮，以芟國恥。遠師往古，不必復總髮之俗，近倣泰西，庶有吳越之風。鳴呼！我邦人其念之！夫禮俗之興，張皇耳目，所關匪小，愛國者，未有不愛禮俗者也。滌舊念之污，奉維新之命，爲此通吿，一體遵照，切切……』云云。</p>
<p>岱山的剪辮會</p>
<p>不過當時民智，尙不開通，各地軍政府雖諄諄勸吿，而民衆狃於陋俗，仍多視此豚尾若禁　，不肯付之一剪者。於是各地有剪髮大會的發起。發起此種運動者，大都頭腦較新。而共方式，也大都是採取「集體」行動。例如辛亥年十月本報所載浙江定海岱山剪辮大會之新聞云云：「定海廳岱山，孤懸海中，風氣撲實。日前鄭瑞臣袁滋卿江宸卿王廷升四君，發起於九月二十三日午後二時，假戴第特開剪髮大會，首由四君剪除，並起說理由，略云：『吾人垂辮，已受二百六十年之專制，方今民國軍政府弔民伐罪，各省次第復恢，吾同胞堂堂漢裔，亟應剪除腐之物，豈甘久作奴隸牛馬云</p>
<p>漢口民軍經由鐵道運砲備戰</p>
<p>民軍佔領武昌後之漢陽門</p>
<p>民國元年曆本之封面圖</p>
<p>辛亥革命决年壬子爲中華民國元年，但紛更之際人民尙不習知民國之正朔，因以黃帝紀元爲曆年，此即當時民間曆本之一種亦以見開國時之草創藍縷矣。云。』此時環聽如堵，的計二百餘人，鼓掌雷動，聞風興起，願剪者人數甚衆，直至五句鐘，始行散會。』</p>
<p>蘇州的剪辮會</p>
<p>又載蘇州剪髮大會之情形云：「自軍政府參謀廳發出勸剪髮辮吿示後，昨日遂有某某等在護龍街王仁孝祠特開剪辮大會，一時到者人數極多，皆簽名願剪，從此豚尾不留，可免西人訕笑」等語，惟當時一般之過老遺少，仍多觀望，致發生軍警大舉勒剪之趣聞多端。</p>

<h3>自由的復活</h3>
<p>— W.C.Bryant　周維駰著譯</p>
<p>自由呵！你不像詩人們的幻想那樣，</p>
<p>似個美好的少女，生就織弱的嬌軀，</p>
<p>羽冠下密貼着波紋的髮髩，</p>
<p>羅馬的奴主用以冠戴他的奴隸，</p>
<p>當他解除了他們的桎梏。</p>
<p>你是一個全副戎裝的鬚眉丈夫，</p>
<p>一隻鐵手把着廣闊的盾牌，</p>
<p>另外握着柄寶劍；</p>
<p>你的容顏雖然是俊美煥發，</p>
<p>但創痕還是舊時戰鬥的表記；</p>
<p>你底雄偉的軀體，</p>
<p>因着鬥爭而茁健。</p>
<p>强權向你虐肆着霹　，</p>
<p>憑着他的閃電對你打擊；</p>
<p>他們不能熄滅你底天賦的生命，</p>
<p>殘忍的强權雖已替你築就邃深的煉獄；</p>
<p>他底黑森的鎧甲，</p>
<p>用了千股的烈火，</p>
<p>鑄成了你的鏈索；</p>
<p>但，當他認爲你已就縛，</p>
<p>環節是片片地粉碎了，</p>
<p>禁獄的堵牆亦已頽倒；</p>
<p>你可驚地跳將出來，</p>
<p>像熊熊的火焰從薪堆上躍起，</p>
<p>向着這個民族吶喊，</p>
<p>在全民族響應着你的呼聲裏，</p>
<p>蒼白着臉的壓迫者匿跡逃避。</p>
<h3>夜街</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>不一定懷念遠方的高山森林，浪濤橋樑，平原，廣漠，我也歡喜作奇怪的想像，幻想許多不同的夜街。</p>
<p>一個朋友吿訴了我關於夜街的事：</p>
<p>「吿訴你，我們這兒有很好的市街。只是不像你所想像的，在日間，在陽光下。牠相反是在夜晚。常月光悄悄地溜出雲陣，靠近山巖一帶的江邊，水波上便撒下一幅黑紗，朦朧地罩上一層陰影。這時街上轟動起人聲了。躱在家裏的悶了一天，老太太攙着家裹的孩子，蹣跚地走上大街，一點也不怕煩地向店夥嘮叨。下鄉的人從鄕下回來了。孩子跳跳蹦蹦地在黑影中亂撞。在這一片夜街上，店鋪不怎麽整齊，零零碎碎分散在由岩的洞穴裏。</p>
<p>我不能忘記那一天夜晚。我往山谷的夜街買了一點東西，預備回家的時候，有點疲倦了，我們幾個朋友在沿江的公園裏坐了一會兒。月光像水銀瀉在明鏡上。岸這邊一片高大的森林，山影像大包袱裹住了長長的夜街。我們便坐在黑暗下看月。對岸草地上亮光光的愈顯得我們黑暗。忽然雄壯的歌聲在我們背後響起來了，我不能不給他們感動。他們的歌透露着歡笑，也訴說出酸辛。他們有生命，也有力，也熱情。我不禁歎了一口氣。我聯想起兩年前故鄕的一晚。在月下，在河邊，同樣激昂的歌聲大的你也還不曾忘記吧。</p>
<p>「懷鄕嗎？我不願意這樣設。因爲我覺得這兒很好，太陽，空氣，火苗情熱，一切都很與我合宜。允其是夜街，那極有趣，也極動人。好，你想像吧——在背江傍山處散佈于林野谿谷間的燈光，蠢動着粗野的人影……那是夜街，那是夜街。」</p>
<p>我讀了，也寫好一對回信。特別引我關切的是一句問話</p>
<p>「你眞的懷鄕嗎？」</p>
<p>三個月後覆信來了：</p>
<p>「不，眞的我一點也不懷鄉。我這兒很好。我愛這兒的夜街。夜街中山野的空氣融和了陌生的心。允許我收回前决的吿訴吧。我不再準備回憶了。」</p>
<p>對於夜街，我能不回憶嗎？我寫下一封信，寫下故鄉的兩年前和他彷彿的一節，寫下山谷間夜街的羨慕。</p>
<p>「你記着的我也還不曾忘記。狹狹的靑石鋪成的街道上，左邊一手的市招快碰着右邊底屋簷。踏着高低不平的路，人擠在一堆兒走過。黑暗小巷中，秋晚有一陣鐵鏟在鍋砂上並出喊喊擦擦的聲音，那便是賣炒銀杏的。從一條荒凉的馬路上，時常可以看到從車站上晚班車下來的一羣客人，黃包車上的油燈運成一整串長的行列。荒僻的巷中聽得着犬吠。小逆旅的木板門罅縫中漏出幾條燈光，用溫情來歡迎顧客………</p>
<p>寫下了又後悔了，一張信紙就這麼擱下，不曾給牠付郵。祇另外簡單的寫了幾行：</p>
<p>「我想像了也羨慕了……背江傍山處散佈在林野谿谷間的燈光，蠢動着粗野的人影。我愛你們那兒的太陽，空氣，火苗的情熱……呵，允其是夜街，夜街……」</p>
<p>眞的他不用懷鄕了。他有比故鄕更可愛的。生命更充實，人更熱烈，街市有情趣，自然也更偉大。</p>
<p>但是我不能不引起一種懷戀呢。在華燈璀璨的夜晚，天空閃亮着紅紅綠綠的霓虹。像狡兔追風般的車輛不停在奔掣着，對流着。馬路上人聲和車聲混和起一陣喧囂。空氣中有灰塵也有脂粉……這不也是夜街？腰纏飽飽的盡情享受的夜街？……我不能不寫下一點羨慕或追想之情了：</p>
<p>「故鄉的夜街使我追憶，山谷的夜街使我羨慕。我都不免於遐想。」</p>
<p>再給朋友寄去一封信。</p>
<h3>落葉</h3>
<p>— 蕭芳</p>
<p>坐在園子裏，枝頭的葉子有韻節似的落下來，不時的飄到朋友的身上。她細細地玩弄着。（在研究是平行脈還是網狀脈嗎？）</p>
<p>「眞怪，到了秋大葉子就會落下來。」這位多幻想的朋友對着很普通的自然現象却有點兒感慨了，遂效哈姆列特王子的獨語，手托着下巴。我却無言。</p>
<p>「怎麽不言語呢？剛才你不是還在抱怨爲了時間衝突不能選讀人生哲學嗎？其實，那倒沒有多大關係。人生是活的，踝本是死的；大學的敎窒裏壓根兒就學不到什麽東西。可是，你來思索一下這葉子的命運吧！保你會參悟了人生的奥妙。」</p>
<p>於是，我隨手檢拾了一片落葉，也玩弄着。從綠得使人見而興奮，到枯黃的一片，是牠生命的歷程。正像花開與花落，月圓和月缺一樣的好景不常而已。我因之記起了一大堆的興廢人事。而悵惘如薄紗罩住我沉思的領域，遂不禁有點兒厭倦了。</p>
<p>「西風掃落葉。牠們終不免飄盪於天地間，而毀滅其形跡。」朋友說，那認眞的模樣如同一個哲學家。「但是，度過了寒冷的冬天，新的葉子會生出來的。和宇宙相較，個體的生命僅是渺小到無的一點，自然，無須因而蔑視牠的存在國不過得認淸人該爲全體與後代闢路，築橋。懂嗎？」</p>
<p>我乃被帶入更深沉的境界，仍無言；想靜靜地再思索一會兒。我知道，我缺乏點康健</p>

<h3>「變」</h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>對立物互相衝突，鬥爭，是不可避免的，之後，才達到更高的階段，這在歷史的過程中是必然的，名之曰「變」。黑格爾言之詳矣。</p>
<p>隨舉歷史上的例：斗筲穿窬的王莽，米脂闖賊的李自成，在或種歷史家看來殊足痛心，尙有餘悸；然而二者當時如在政經方策民衆運動匕把握得好，未始不可讓後來的董狐給他們加上「太祖高皇帝」的榮銜罷。但耍說他們底「變」是偶然的嗎？自然是不！</p>
<p>商鞅廢「井田」（？）平權衡，變古獨往，把溫和敦厚套上去，則不免流於刑名，刻薄，以致作法自斃，車裂以徇，似死不足惜；但在那時商業資產階級的抬頭上來說明，則自然不比道學家們底想像來得簡單。</p>
<p>在歷史最可怪的那是王安石，雖然後來梁啟超還曾對他做X大政治家之一。他篡位，似查無實據，做過强盜「游來游去」吾，則又太寃枉。「天變不足畏，祖宗不足法，人言不足惜」，已在經傳之外，然而更被蘇洵輩痛恨的倒在「囚首喪面，而談詩書」。不修邊幅，算是討飯罷，去唱蓮花落也成，而偏要談詩書，「充儒家」，由此而「變法」；並且文學技巧又這樣高明，會寫得一手好文章，因此不免比盧杞更壞，簡直是洪水猛獸。於是反對，反對！</p>
<p>反對的理由在於苟安，保守，本身的利益得以維持——「變」是麻煩的，古老的地主資產階級底地位不因之而動搖嗎？的確，王安石底變法正針對了當時農業社會中的一切不良制度而發，在一般塲合，承認着中農的利益，這無疑要給予大地主資產階級一個劇烈的打擊。你瞧：「靑苗法」以州縣常平倉的現錢接濟平民，使乘時耕種，恰免除了高利貸的剝削；「市易法」呢，借資給小商人，來調節社會供應，使大商業資本無法壟斷居奇，從中掠取；而「令法運使」又呌地主官僚，不能上下其手，侵奪中飽；「保甲法」安定地方，剿滅盜匪，然而抗戰起來，國家抽丁不免讓地主小少爺麻煩，這於他們又不行！</p>
<p>他們行的是得過且過，一逝者如斯，而未嘗往也；盈虛者如彼，而卒莫消長也。」世界上的「變」是「錯覺」，我在物始在？「可自其不變者而觀之，物與我皆無盡也。」對酒當歌，人生幾何？「江上之淸風，山間之明月，」來罷，陶醉罷。「我與子之所共適，嘰哩咕囉！」管他東北遼的侵入，西北西夏的崛起，歷年外患頻仍，社會陷入極大的不安，嘰哩咕囉——要打酒呃了，呃！然而歷史上看來，不但因爲打酒呃，「聞」之足戒，王安石底「變」的英雄主義的演出也未始不可爲之警惕不已：他雖然與反對者起了無情的衝突，却沒得到下唇的更大的同情與之有很好的連繫；而在行政上所用的官僚蔡京章惇輩，竟會盡了從中漁利惠不及下的叛變的任務。無怪王氏在中國政治運動史上竟留下汚點。</p>
<p>「變」是必然的，而主觀的推動必須得「力」；「不惜人言」的「人」，是大衆還是小衆？</p>
<p>另一方面，我們必須指出：打酒呃的盡情陶醉也是沒有「不變者」的；阮大鬍子拚命致力於「九錯十錯」，却依然搬演於筵席之間，「變死」而已。</p>

<h3>國慶與游藝界</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>今天是雙十國慶，因而使我想起歷來國慶紀念日游藝界的動態。國慶那天，在中日戰事未發生前，游藝界是非常活躍的，眞所調普天同慶。</p>
<p>單就上海說來，國慶那天，一般的電影院，不拘是專映國片或外片，都要選上好的新片，而且不管晴雨，塲塲客滿，盛况不减冬至新年。所以有幾家影院，還要加映一二塲，除了收費的電影之外，還有免費電影，由當局商借影院，免費公映；同時各影片公司的電影從業員，還得來一次盛大的慶祝會。</p>
<p>京戲院也不例外，這一天，名角登台都要調整陣容排演名劇。</p>
<p>游戲塲裏，每一個班子表演精彩的游藝，而且各藝員上了台，都要說幾句慶祝雙十的好口彩。舞塲也是通宵達旦，舞客特別熱鬧，在歡了一夜，等於耶誕，新年。</p>
<p>此外更有學校團體非職業的藝人，表演各種游藝，開盛大的游藝會：雙簧哩，音樂哩，話劇哩，熱鬧的情形，一言難盡。</p>
<p>如今上海已成「孤島」雖逢國慶，已遠沒有往日的熱鬧。我們祗有回憶過去的情况，而切望中國最後的勝利就將到來，上海恢復原狀之後，再能覩此種國慶的盛况了！</p>
<h3>宋德珠藝員談：　練蹺工與打出手（上）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>編者介紹：宋德珠，字頴之，津籍，年廿三歲，爲故都「四小名旦」中獨以文武兼工，稱名於時之後起雋才。者番初度南來，「黃金」試藝，一鳴驚人，具見眞才實藝，獲此盛名，良非倖致。而本篇自述練戲經過，足見砥礪功深，與武工戲之大不易爲，亦殊饒情味也。</p>
<h3>藝人漫記</h3>
<p>我在戲劇界裏是一個後進的演員，早年從十四歲投進北平戲曲學校習藝，經七年半直到前年暑期，方吿畢業。此後自己挑班子組織穎光社在當地出演，迄今尙不足兩年，自知工力還淺，正待加勁努力，和企求各方面的指敎；所以我所願意說的事，只能限於學戲練工的經歷與鄙見。</p>
<p>初習武旦</p>
<p>在戲校裏，我是第一期學生。爲此校方例照「德和金玉……」排名，我算是德字輩，藝名故稱德珠。戲校規例，除武旦一行外，本來是有「女扮女，男扮男。」這一個規定，我亦起先只是專學武旦戲的；後來，戲校當局認爲我是一個天賦不錯，極宜於演唱靑衣花衫的戲料，才願自破定例，開始教我學習花旦起來。這事情記得在進校第四年間，副校長李伯言先生，當時且於每晨七時到校，親自給我拉胡琴吊嗓子。他在一片很熱烈的愛護心下，更對我督責得特別嚴厲，甚至爲我不很專心，不惜摔碎胡琴，用作有力的剌戟。同時，又爲校長給學生操琴，顯見過分偏愛，激起衆同學的不平，李先生亦仍依然如常，無所顧念。因此，學習武旦而能有這嗓子來唱文戲，實在全由李先生一手造就而眞使我爲畢生感念難忘的。</p>
<p>名師指授</p>
<p>初習武旦戲時，係經余玉琴，郭際湘，朱桂芳，閻少秋先生等指援。余先生名莊，專工武旦，也即是「十三妹」劇的創始者。郭先生藝名水仙花，花旦兼演武旦，他的蹺工委實太好了。而朱閻（即九陣風）兩位先生也都是武旦行中最優特的名角。故經頻年磨練，還能獲得稍許的成就，在武工方面，那全是得力於這幾位良師的指導。但可惜，余先生等早已老成凋謝，墓木已拱，我都沒有再受敎益的可能了！</p>
<h3>鄧波兒的跑馬亭</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>好萊塢二十世紀福斯公司的攝影廠背後，有一座廣大的花園，專供拍外景用。園中有許多世界名勝的模型，如巴黎鐵塔，紐的市街，埃及金字塔，景况逼眞；另有一座精緻的電氣跑馬亭，這是專供首席童星秀蘭鄧波兒游玩用的。原來鄧波兒生性好動，拍戲到不耐煩時，便困倦欲眠，無精打采，實行怠工，導演無法可施，商之於兒童心理學家，依照計劃在後花園的凉亭裏，搭造跑馬亭一座，在她一覺得疲倦的時候，就路上馬背兜着圈子，剌激她的精神。亭子的裝配是一個活動的圓舞臺，中有旋轉軸心，四週裝有木馬八匹，披着繡花的馬鞍，，搖搖擺擺，奔跑很速，鄧波兒騎過木馬，精神抖擻，便肯繼續拍戲。當起初時候，導演以爲這只是對付小孩子的辦法而已，那知日子一久，其他的成人演員，也和鄧波兒一樣，很快地染上了跑馬的習慣，非此不能過廳，因此鄧波兒小姐的八匹木馬，整日有足不停蹄之勢，騎馬同志也越來越多了。</p>
<p>「武則天」今日起在璇宮上演，該院爲恭祝國慶，特於今晨九時半加演「賽金花」一塲，上圖係夏霞飾武則天之戲裝。</p>
<h3>女明星口上的女子優雅術</h3>
<p>查得娜（Zorina）這個優雅的女子，是好萊塢的名舞星。她在幼稚園的時候，已經開始練習舞蹈了。她說，每一個女子都可變爲優雅，僅不過只要注意幾條簡單的規則就行。</p>
<p>她說，當一個女子坐的時候，切忌裝腔作勢；但須記好鎭靜——一個女子最好就是要有鎮靜悠閒的態度。她應交起她的脚踝，並不是交起她的雙膝。帶偏一些坐在椅予上，將兩手自然的置在膝部。</p>
<p>一個活潑可愛的樣子，可以造成一個生動靈敏的個性。當一個女子在行動的時候，更可顯示她的活潑，而能引人注意，不過這行動必須文雅而莊重。</p>
<p>查利娜說，當走的時候，須有亭亭玉立的姿態，用着雙腿着重在足尖行動，文雅的利用雙臂；並且要運用得平衡相稱。</p>
<p>當靜立時，身體宜帶側，切勿正對前面。對人說話時，一足稍蠜，身體的分量支在另一脚上。　（械）</p>

<h3>Auspicious News from Northern Hunan Adorns National Day; Chinese Army Recovers Xinqiang and Yanglin Street; Troops Crossing the River Recapture Rongjiawan and Fiercely Attack Lujiaoshi; Chinese Army in Northern Jiangxi Recaptures Zhicheng and Luofang, Approaching Nanchang</h3>

<p>The Course of the Great Battle in Northern Hunan</p>
<p>A reporter from a certain place in northern Hunan paid a visit to a certain commander at a certain place in the front on the 8th and inquired about the process of annihilating the Japanese army in northern Hunan. He was received and answered each question as follows: (Question) It is said that the Japanese invasion this time was aimed at plundering our lake area's rice to alleviate the difficulties of their military food supply. I wonder if the real purpose of the Japanese invasion was really this? (Answer) Judging from the Japanese's consistent stingy behavior, I dare not say that there is no such attempt. However, after the government and the people jointly rushed to transport the rice in the lake area, they were unable to plunder it. I believe that the biggest reason is that since the July 7th Incident, their cabinet has changed repeatedly, and the government's control has become weaker and weaker. For a year, there has been no military progress. Not only has there been criticism domestically, but international prestige has also been greatly reduced. To cover up their ugliness, they want to show that their new cabinet can take advantage of the European war, speculate and take advantage, and rob while the fire is burning, which is why they launched this invasion. (Question) The Japanese army retreated in a hurry less than two weeks after this invasion. What is the reason? Can you tell us something about the process of the battle? (Answer) It is better to say that it was a rout than a retreat, because their rear was cut off by us everywhere. If they do not know their limits, they will be completely annihilated by us. As for the battle process of the Japanese invasion of Changsha, it is divided into three routes, with northern Hunan as the main attack, and southern Hubei and northern Jiangxi as supporting attacks. The Japanese in southern Hubei were the [omitted] division (three-regiment system). They invaded Maishi from southeast of Tongcheng. According to our predetermined strategy, we lured the Japanese to the vicinity of Taoshugang, surrounded them on three sides, and attacked them from both sides. The remains of those killed by us, which were buried by our army, amounted to more than three thousand. The wounded were twice as many. Only more than two thousand people escaped to the Changshou Street area, and they were also annihilated by us. Except for those left to guard the rear, it can be said that no one escaped from this enemy army. It was an unprecedented feat since the beginning of the war. The enemy in northern Hunan was the entire [omitted] division, the [omitted] third division, and the naval landing force. After our army launched successive attacks at Changhu and Fulinpu, and reached the vicinity of Fulinpu and Sanjieqiao, they were severely attacked by our ambush troops, and casualties piled up. With the supply of ammunition cut off, they fled north in droves. The casualties of the enemy on this route were at least over 15,000. The [omitted] third division in northern Jiangxi invaded west from Xiushui, and after being severely attacked by us in the areas east of Gao'an and Luofang, Shangfu, Ganfang, Huangshaqiao, and Da'e, due to heavy casualties, the remnants gradually fled east, in a state of unprecedented panic. (Question) After the enemy's failure this time, will they increase their troops and invade Changsha again? (Answer) The question is not whether they will invade again, or whether they can occupy one or two key points, but what price they will pay when they invade, and how to manage the aftermath after they occupy them. In other words, it is possible for the enemy warlords to transfer three or five more divisions to China, but even if they can occupy some key points after adding three or five more divisions, it can still be determined that they cannot solve the entire war situation. The deeper the enemy goes, the greater their difficulties will be, and the more they increase their troops, the faster their collapse will be. (Question) Why did our army win such a great victory this time? (Answer) In terms of combat spirit, our army has always been in an active position. All units and soldiers can cooperate with each other, do not avoid difficulties and dangers, and can attack the enemy in any difficult environment. There has never been a situation of collapse, which is completely different from the enemy's lack of fighting spirit and mutual resentment between superiors and subordinates. The help of the broad masses of the people in assisting the army in joint operations is the main reason for our victory. In terms of terrain, the Mufu and Jiugong mountains are intertwined, and the roads are rugged, so that we can cut off the enemy everywhere, creating an irreparable situation. (Question) What are the commander's thoughts on this battle? Can the enemy's attempt to destroy China be shattered? (Answer) I have often said that the destruction of a country must have three conditions: (1) The people's national consciousness is reduced; (2) All the land is occupied by others; (3) The military force is resolved by others. Looking back at our country after the war, national consciousness is high, most of the land except for a few points of money is still controlled by us, and the more we fight, the stronger we become. The enemy has not been able to conquer us for two years, and will never be able to conquer us in the future. In the past, Xiang Yu fought seventy-two battles and won every battle. As soon as he heard the songs of Chu, he was defeated. Today's Japanese warlords are more brutal than Xiang Yu, and have more than Xiang Yu's invincible spirit. However, they are very reckless in their actions. It can be concluded that they will be defeated in their war against us. This battle is just the greatest success of the tactical change in the second phase of the War of Resistance. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Visits Foreign Minister Wang</h3>
<p>Chongqing - British Ambassador Kerr visited Foreign Minister Wang at 11:00 AM on the 9th for a routine meeting. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, flew here from Hong Kong two days ago and will stay in Chongqing for some time. It is not yet certain, but he will remain here for at least a month. Mr. Bairone, who is in charge of the affairs of the British diplomatic mission in Chongqing, will now depart for Kunming. All the affairs of the diplomatic mission will be temporarily handled by Mr. Haight, the second secretary of the British Embassy. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Since arriving here on the 7th, British Ambassador Kerr has been very busy visiting Chinese dignitaries. However, he has not yet been able to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, because the Chairman is still in Chengdu. Today, the Shishi Xinbao published an editorial on the British Ambassador's arrival in Chongqing, saying that since Japan has declared that there is no possibility of reopening British-Japanese negotiations at present, but Britain still hopes for the resumption of British-Japanese conferences, is this not different from indulging in the illusion of compromise with Japan? The newspaper deeply regrets the wavering of British Far Eastern policy, and said that the British people should know the following three points: (1) China is determined to resolutely resist the war to the end; (2) There is no hope of ending the war until China achieves complete victory; (3) Only with China's victory can there be strength for world peace.

<h3>Reminiscences of the Twenty-Eighth National Day</h3>
<p>On October 10, 1911, the Chinese Revolutionary Army initiated the uprising in Wuchang. Prior to this, the banner of righteousness had been raised several times, but all ended in failure. On this day of this year, however, success was achieved in one fell swoop, creating a republic and establishing the Republic of China. To this day, it has been twenty-eight years since the old country received a new life. In terms of history, twenty-eight years is only a short fragment. When discussing matters, it has always been said that "thirty years is one generation," which is still less than one generation. When discussing people, how long is human life? It is like a white horse passing through a crack, but it must be said that "thirty years is strong," which is still not yet the age of strength. Moreover, in a great nation of five thousand years, which contains endless sources of life and carries on the past and opens up the future, it is just beginning to flourish, then it can be said that twenty-eight years is not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Creation is truly fond of teasing people. Tracing back to the time since mankind has had records, the international joys and sorrows, reunions and separations, prosperity and decline, and rise and fall, the drama of their evolution, and the scientific exploration of the mysteries and subtle details, and the conquest of nature, the number of original ideas is greater than these twenty-eight years. Even in China, within these fleeting twenty-eight years, the internal turbulence and external encounters have been extremely turbulent, extremely serious, extremely tragic, and extremely glorious, which is not only unprecedented in Chinese history, but also no country or nation, at any period, can be compared with China during these twenty-eight years. If we look back, all the worrying, joyful, commendable, and tearful deeds are vividly in our eyes and hearts, and none of them are not personally experienced and witnessed by today's elderly and middle-aged people; and today, we are still staying in this most exciting great era.</p>
<p>The various things since the establishment of the Republic of China are too numerous to recount, and it is not necessary to recount them. However, there are things that are worth summarizing and comparing: China's international status, national consciousness, political phenomena, cultural standards, economic situation, and social organization in the late Qing Dynasty, compared to today after twenty-eight years, although not ideal, not enough to compete with the modern era, each has made significant progress, which is visible to all. Since the rise of the War of Resistance, although many weaknesses have been exposed, there are more than enough clear proofs of the advantages of the nation. After 1895, the international community regarded China as foolish and deceitful, and discussions of partition arose everywhere. Fortunately, thanks to the balance of power, it barely maintained its existence. In the early days of the Republic of China, it was still entrusting its fate to the balance of power, which cannot be denied. As the times changed, the strength of various countries gradually became disparate due to the ebb and flow. The situation of the balance of power was precarious. If China's phenomena were the same as in the late Qing Dynasty, then at the latest in the most recent two or three years, Britain and France would be controlled by Europe, and the United States would be unable to help those who do not help themselves. China would be destroyed, Japan would be the sole hegemon, and would Europeans and Americans in the Far East have a foothold? Fortunately, China is determined to resist the war. Subjectively, this is to save the country and survive, but objectively, its function is to bravely deal with the aggressor country, which is to support the declining order in the Far East. Not only that, but it also prevents the aggressor countries in Europe and Asia from colluding with each other. China is also fighting vigorously and effectively for the balance of power in the entire world. If British and French people speak with a clear conscience, if it were not for China's resistance to the war, would Britain and France not face greater threats in Europe and Asia at the same time that they could not take care of? China's resistance to the war is a necessity for establishing the country, not to perform for the international community, but China's international status has risen far beyond the late Qing Dynasty, which is recognized by the international community.</p>
<p>National consciousness is the spiritual barrier for a country to stand in the international community. The achievements of the Xinhai Revolution can naturally prove that it was a political revolution. However, anyone who is old or middle-aged who can recall the situation of the Xinhai Revolution will not recognize that the revolution at that time was based on national consciousness. At that time, only the imperial court and the imperial family had not yet eliminated the boundaries between Manchus and Han. Those very few people regarded hundreds of millions of people as foreigners and ruled over them, so it was not surprising that they were unlucky. Moreover, after losing wars and territories to foreign countries, the politics were corrupt, the discipline was ruined, officials were sold and ranks were sold, bribery was rampant, exorbitant taxes were levied, and the people were not living. Were they still engaged in deceiving the people? The Wuchang Uprising and the response of the provinces were unprecedented in their momentum. However, the national consciousness revealed in it was quite common, but not as common and in-depth as it is now. Today, the people of China do not complain when they suffer from war disasters, and they do not refuse to go to sacrifices. After more than two years of hard fighting, the army has displayed its courage to continue its efforts, so it has recently won a great victory in northern Hunan. The people have maintained their hatred of the enemy, so they scoff at various political methods of confusion and temptations for complacency and compromise, and are unmoved. This is because the national consciousness is common and in-depth, which is not enough.</p>
<p>As for the general political phenomena, cultural standards, economic situation, and social organization, we do not have time to list the events before and after twenty-eight years and compare them one by one. However, the past was extremely dim and the recent years have tended to be bright, which is personally experienced by any elderly and middle-aged person. This can be seen in the extraordinary period, which is full of mutations. Even this mutation is difficult to imagine in the late Qing Dynasty. Let me describe two or three points: How do the technicians and experts recruited by government offices today compare to the various sitting officials and conference officials of the Qing Dynasty? How do the quality and quantity of today's elementary school textbooks compare to the curriculum of the elementary schools of the Qing Dynasty? How do the goods in today's domestic goods market compare to the foreign goods and local goods in the market of the Qing Dynasty? How do the groups of today's industry and commerce compare to the chambers of commerce that only had "government supervision and merchant management" in the Qing Dynasty? From this, we can see the general situation.</p>
<p>In short, the progress of China in the past twenty-eight years, although it cannot be said to be satisfactory, is by no means a waste of time, and this cannot be achieved without revolution.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Most Encouraging Message to the National People on National Day: Do Not Fail the Hardships of the Martyrs in Creating the Nation, Rise Up Together to Complete the Mission of Defending the Country</h3>
<p>Chengdu - On the 28th National Day, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a message to the national people, saying that today is the 28th anniversary of the founding of our Republic of China. Our national soldiers and civilians have been fighting hard for more than two years. Recalling the hardships of the martyrs in creating the nation and looking forward to the bright future of the revolution, we know that all our compatriots must have the enthusiasm to strive forward and catch up quickly. Recently, we have won a victory in northern Hunan, which has slightly washed away the blood and slightly comforted the grief and indignation of our compatriots. However, the war of resistance and national construction have a myriad of aspects. The responsibility of our compatriots will inevitably become more difficult as the final victory approaches. On this glorious anniversary of the revolution, I would like to sincerely convey the following key points to our compatriots: First, our compatriots must recognize that our country today is a country in the midst of a revolution. Our war of resistance is to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete the National Revolution. Throughout history, revolutionary undertakings must go through countless dangers and hardships before they can achieve success. There is absolutely no reason to hope for a fluke success. However, once the revolutionary forces are launched, they will never stop until they reach their goal. Once national consciousness is awakened, it can never be hindered by any force. The National Revolution of our China will definitely succeed. When we look back to today twenty-eight years ago, what reliable basis did our revolution have? At that time, there was almost nothing in the military, economic, and diplomatic relations that could be compared with today. However, our Premier Sun Yat-sen raised his arms and called out, and the compatriots of the whole country responded in unison. Even in the midst of nothing, they finally overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic. It is known that the success of revolutionary undertakings lies entirely in the trend of events that conform to the will of Heaven and the people, and the promotion of national spirit. It can never be measured by tangible material conditions. Our current war of resistance and revolution cannot hide the current difficulties, and we must expect even more serious difficulties in the future. However, in terms of the various revolutionary foundations of our current international relations, economic situation, and military strength, they are more solid and stronger than those of any other country's revolution. Therefore, the key lies in whether we have the determination to work hard and sacrifice, and the courage to inherit the cause of the revolutionary martyrs. In other words, if we have this reliable revolutionary foundation, but we still cannot destroy the obstacles and win the victory, so as to obtain the freedom and equality of China, we will not be able to face the martyrs who fought for the country bare-handed on that day. This is what all our compatriots should recognize and strive for. Second, our compatriots should know that the success of the war of resistance in the future does not depend entirely on the superiority or inferiority of the military, but on the spirit of common struggle of the national compatriots. Today, we have established a foundation in the military and will definitely win the final victory. All our frontline soldiers will be able to increasingly enrich the revolutionary foundation, exert military power, and fulfill the natural duty of soldiers to defend the country and protect the race, so as to comfort the expectations of our compatriots. However, the war of resistance in the future must be achieved by the unanimous uprising of our compatriots, using resolute actions to break the enemy's so-called political offensive and economic offensive conspiracies other than military attacks. Therefore, in today's war of resistance, in addition to promoting national righteousness and attacking traitorous acts, so as to destroy the Japanese political organization, the first task is to improve the national integrity of the people in the front, the rear, and especially in the occupied areas, to strictly implement national public morality, to exert the strength of guerrillas, to organize like-minded compatriots, to seize opportunities, and to destroy all economic organizations under the puppet organization and in the occupied areas, to respond to each other, and to destroy all Japanese transportation construction. This kind of work cannot be done by the frontline soldiers alone. It depends on the universal mobilization of compatriots in the occupied areas. What I mean by the center of gravity of the war of resistance in the future not being entirely in the military, but turning to the struggle of the national compatriots, is the second point. Third, the only key to the victory of our war of resistance today, whether in the front or in the rear, lies in destroying the Japanese tools for political aggression. In the future, we have actually entered the stage of intangible spiritual war of resistance from the tangible weapon war of resistance. If there are family members and relatives who are loyal to the enemy, no matter whether they are father and son, brothers, superiors or subordinates, old or young, or even relatives in the family and villages, they must be killed without waiting for the end of the day. In this way, mutual stimulation and common sanctions can make the national flaws swept away. Our country has the ancient训of destroying relatives for righteousness, and it is also known to the people in remote villages. Therefore, promoting righteousness and promoting the national spirit of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame is the most urgent task and the fundamental plan for completing the great cause of the war of resistance. This is what our compatriots must know and must strive for. There is something else that must be stated here. Today, two years ago, it was already appropriate to inform our compatriots that this war is a long-term and arduous struggle, and it is definitely not a short-term battle that can be completed in a year and a half. Since the beginning of the war of resistance, we have embarked on a long and arduous road. Unless we integrate and condense the blood and sweat of the national compatriots and the souls of our revolutionary martyrs into the cause of resisting the war and building the country, and continuously promote them, so as to achieve the entire revolutionary goal, we will never be able to obtain the long-term happiness of the country, nor will we be able to fulfill the great responsibility of our Republic of China to the world. Therefore, today, we must not only not have the slightest fear of difficulty and complacency, but also not have the slightest thought of seeking a quick solution. We cannot be eager to hope for the end of the war and the retreat of the Japanese, and we cannot hope that the Japanese will have the awareness of abandoning aggression. We must know that the fulfillment of the goal of the war of resistance must rely on the full promotion of real strength. We must also realize that before the final victory is obtained, there can be no real peace. Before the Japanese have realized the real power of our comprehensive and sustained war of resistance, there can be no real awareness. On the contrary, if we can front and rear, regardless of soldiers and civilians, regardless of men and women, wisdom and foolishness, unite, persevere in struggle, not fear death, not steal peace, not hesitate to sacrifice, not count the time, and move forward bravely, the longer we last, the more we will strive, then the final victory will surely be realized. Therefore, today, we should abandon our own fear of difficulty and complacency and the psychology of hoping for a quick solution. There is an ancient saying: "It is easy to break the thieves in the mountains, but it is difficult to break the thieves in the heart." Those who cannot endure hardship, cannot persist, cannot persevere to the last five minutes are all thieves written in the heart of the war of resistance and revolution. This is what our compatriots must be deeply aware of. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>National Government Proclaims Several Principles, Reaffirms Governing Authority and Responsibilities, Denies Illegal Actions</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Government issued a declaration on October 10th, the 28th year of the Republic of China, stating in brief: "Since the founding of the Republic of China, twenty-eight years have passed. Thinking of the difficulty of its creation and mindful of the gravity of our responsibilities, we hereby proclaim several principles on this National Day to encourage our soldiers and civilians. Since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, our frontline soldiers have fought to save the nation and the state, sacrificing themselves to protect our territorial sovereignty. Advancing wave upon wave, undeterred by setbacks, their heroic achievements shine in the annals of history. People from all regions have endured all kinds of suffering, destroying their homes to alleviate national difficulties, vying to support national policies, unwavering from beginning to end. All these contributions are expressions of a sacred patriotic heart, making our national prestige grow daily. Final victory will undoubtedly belong to us. From now on, we hope that all soldiers and civilians throughout the country will not be arrogant or discouraged, but will increase their loyalty and do their utmost to complete the mission of the times. As for traitors and puppets, they disgrace their ancestors and leave a burden to their descendants, not only are they abandoned by all mankind, but they are also not tolerated by national law. This government issued a declaration on December 20th, the 26th year of the Republic of China, stating that any pseudo-political organization found in the occupied areas, and all its actions, both internally and externally, are naturally invalid. Now that our war of resistance has lasted for more than two years, the enemy knows that their military aggression will ultimately fail, so they are trying to entice scoundrels and create puppets, hoping to use them as toys to confuse the public. We hereby reaffirm that the Republic of China alone grants the National Government the legal authority to manage all governing powers, to promulgate laws internally, and to conclude treaties externally. The integrity of our sovereignty must not be violated. Should any puppet organization usurp our name, issue announcements without authorization, or privately conclude documents with any country, they will not be recognized at any time."

<h3>President Kong Understands the Hardships of Soldiers and Civilians in War Zones</h3>

We remember that our soldiers and civilians in the war zones have suffered for a long time, but with one heart and unified virtue, they have remained steadfast. Their loyalty to the Party and their love for the country are truly commendable. Now that the military situation is progressing daily, politics should be even more enlightened. I hope that the governments of all war zones will continue to work hard with a spirit of perseverance to achieve complete success. In the midst of joy and encouragement, let us maintain a sense of caution and self-reflection. The boundless blessings of the nation for hundreds of millions of years will begin here."

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Assault and Humiliate American Priest</h3>
<p>Peiping: According to a statement issued today by a Japanese military spokesman, a Japanese soldier who assaulted an American Catholic priest, Maloney, on the first of this month while intoxicated, is now impossible to trace. Although the Japanese soldier was taken to the Japanese military headquarters at the time, he was released after the headquarters inquired about his name and number. However, it was later discovered that the name and number provided by the Japanese soldier were purely fabricated at the time, and in fact no such person existed, so it was impossible to summon him for questioning. Therefore, the details claimed by Father Maloney cannot be verified. According to Father Maloney, on the first of this month, outside the gate of the Catholic Church, he heard a commotion. He went outside to see what was happening and saw a drunken Japanese soldier beating a Chinese coolie. Father Maloney stepped forward to mediate, but the Japanese soldier punched him, calling him an "Englishman." Father Maloney insisted that he was an American, but the Japanese soldier insisted that he was an Englishman. Then the Japanese soldier snatched the pipe from Father Maloney's mouth and pushed him aside, entering the church residence and searching it arbitrarily. He confiscated a fountain pen and a Japanese idiom book. Father Maloney then showed the Japanese soldier his American passport, but the Japanese soldier crumpled it into a ball and threw it on the ground, ordering Father Maloney to hand over a woman. Father Maloney said that this was a priest's residence and there were no women, but the Japanese soldier insisted on having him hand one over. Therefore, the priest called the Chinese police for help. The Chinese police, not daring to offend the Japanese soldier, reported it to the Japanese military police, and the matter was settled.

<h3>European Situation May Expand Again, Chamberlain Declares, British and French War Aims are the Same, Daladier Scheduled to Deliver a Broad Speech Tonight, Germany and the Soviet Union Agree on Economic Cooperation Measures</h3>
<p>London: During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Henderson, a Labour Party member of the opposition, asked whether the British and French governments would jointly issue a declaration clarifying their war aims. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "The war aims of the British and French governments are completely the same. They have been explained repeatedly by both governments. In the future, we should issue a statement in a more practical form. We should always consider it and issue it based on the common will of both governments." Then, Ms. Riceburn, a member of the Transcendental Party, asked whether the government was aware that public opinion was eager for the government to clearly explain its war aims. Prime Minister Chamberlain did not answer. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet and Italian Newspapers Discuss War and Peace Issues, Urge Negotiations Based on Hitler's Proposal, American Newspapers Criticize Hitler's Speech as Absurd</h3>
<p>Moscow: Izvestia published an editorial today entitled "Peace or War?" It stated, "The Polish war has been over for several weeks, a fact that no one can deny. The Polish army has been completely captured, and the Polish government has fled abroad. Except for the upper-class landlords and the bourgeoisie, no social stratum in Poland is willing to preserve the paper tiger-like state that they artificially created to oppress all ethnic groups, including the Polish people. The Soviet and German governments have already begun to restore peace and order in the former Polish territory and enable people to live and work in peace according to their ethnic characteristics. The rapid collapse of the Polish state structure has removed the reason for the Western European war to continue. Poland cannot be restored to its original state. This is obvious to the blind. However, Britain and France are still using the restoration of Poland as a slogan to wage war against Germany. This war is a senseless massacre, and a truce is in the interest of all peoples. Although Hitler's proposal can be accepted, rejected, or amended at will, it must be recognized that the proposal can serve as the basis for negotiating peace. Since the British and French governments have repeatedly declared their willingness to achieve peace, they should consider this possibility of ending the war. However, so far, the British and French newspapers' criticisms of Hitler's speech do not indicate this. Most of them advocate rejection. Britain and France should continue to fight until their goals are fully achieved. But one thing is noteworthy in the newspapers' tone, that the main condition of the past, the restoration of Poland, is now relatively silent, and replaced by the 'elimination of Hitlerism.' It is said that the fundamental and sole purpose of Britain and France's current war is to resist Hitler's ideology, because that ideology is the sole major cause of war in Europe and even the world. This argument is of course a reflection of the official stance of Britain and France, but can we blindly accept it as a reason to continue the war? No. Everyone has the right to support or oppose any ideology, but if someone opposes a certain ideology and uses it as a reason to massacre humanity, then its absurdity and senselessness are no different from the religious wars of the Middle Ages that massacred heretics. History has long proven that such ideological and religious wars only result in the massacre of the entire human race and the destruction of culture. No ideology can be destroyed by swords or flames. The world has the right to respect or hate Hitlerism or any political claim, but waging a war to 'eliminate Hitlerism' is a major political mistake. Until recently, the ruling classes of Britain and France have never shown excessive enthusiasm for bloodshed, especially for making any sacrifices for any ideology. History has proven that the opposite is true. Noble principles and ideas are often unveiled as a smokescreen for base and material desires. Even now, the so-called slogan of resisting Hitler's ideology or spirit is still difficult to say whether it is a smokescreen for the other desires of the ruling classes of Britain and France, such as consolidating their ruling position. On this point, George Bernard Shaw's recent article in 'New Statesman and Nation' is particularly noteworthy. Shaw said: 'The Polish war is over, Poland has failed, and we have no reason to continue the war. Therefore, we throw away the mask of the warrior and frankly admit that we do not care about Poland, but only aim to restore the original balance of power and destroy Germany. We now call this move the elimination of Hitlerism. If we win, Versailles will reappear, but it will be even worse, and another war will occur in less than twenty years. No matter how thickly we paint it with liberal democrats and all the rubbish that we ourselves have now abandoned, the reason for the war cannot stand. We can only make peace with Hitler and the whole world, and stop acting foolishly and destroying our own people.' Shaw's words are mostly true. In view of all the facts, the ruling classes of Britain and France are not at all concerned about the fate of Poland or liberating the German people from Hitler's regime. The two countries each have vast colonies. The British Empire has a population of 450 million, and the French colonies have 65 million people. Therefore, what other purposes can the British and French governments have for fighting Germany, except to resist Germany's demands and maintain this vast territory, so as to calmly exploit hundreds of millions of colonial slaves? Anyone who refuses Germany's peace proposal must bear the responsibility for the continuation of the war, and thus the enormous sacrifices and destruction of the war. War or peace? Those who shout the slogan 'fight until victory' advocate war and oppose peace, but who benefits from this war for world domination? The working class will never benefit. The working class will only suffer in this kind of war." (9th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: Rome broadcast today that Italy has not put forward a proposal for a truce, nor does it want to make a military move, but it will give spiritual support to any movement to end the war. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia published an article written by Gayda, discussing Hitler's peace proposal, saying that for the sake of European civilization, Italy invites all responsible powers to face reality so as to rein in the horse on the edge of the cliff in time and avoid a major disaster. Hitler's proposal is not only limited to the proposal for a truce, but its purpose is to establish a new European order based on the unity of interests. The speaker said that Herr Hitler's proposal was vague, but it would be more true to say that this proposal has pointed out the path. The proposal is indeed not thorough and does not cover the final details, but this is not necessary today either. The principles of the proposal and the very complex causes of the current European crisis are in line with each other. The peace that can be gained on the Western Front after a long period of bloody fighting may not be much different from what Germany is proposing today. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: The New York World-Telegram's editorial today condemned Hitler's "peace speech" as extremely absurd, saying that the more one studies this speech, the more one cannot believe that a civilized European power has such a spokesperson. Judging from history, such empty talk that has nothing to do with reality is rare. The wording is extremely arrogant, and the intention is even more absurd. One cannot help but call it neurotic. It is difficult to see any progress towards peace until Hitler is overthrown. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The United States is Inconvenienced to Mediate the European Situation, A Glimpse of American Newspaper Opinion</h3>
<p>New York: American newspapers are generally unwilling for President Roosevelt to accept Germany's informal request and mediate the European war. The Republican New York Herald Tribune recently published an article entitled "The United States is Inconvenienced to Mediate," which stated that the United States is currently powerless to do anything. Those who hope that a major neutral country will come forward to mediate are trying to force the United States to collude with them. How can the United States fall into their trap? In addition, Britain and France are unwilling to make this clumsy move (i.e., requesting mediation). At this time, to take on the role of mediator is tantamount to intervening. If not, it is also inserting oneself into the situation. However, the American people are determined not to be involved in the conflict. The Democratic New York Times reported that according to German sources, people in the German government firmly believe that the proposals put forward by Hitler can be used as a basis for Britain and France or mediators to end the war. "This belief may exist, because Hitler has always underestimated Britain and France, or he hopes that this belief will have an internal effect, saying that the conditions put forward by Hitler are extremely fair, because if the war drags on, Hitler must use excuses to appease the people, and he has to make preparations in advance." (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Public Opinion, Britain and France Must Expose Hitler's Strategy</h3>
<p>London: The morning newspapers here are still studying carefully the speech delivered by German leader Hitler, saying that Britain and France will definitely reject the peace talks, but the strategy used by Hitler must be exposed and a counter-proposal must be put forward to answer it, so that the responsibility for continuing the war can be attributed to Germany. In addition, the newspapers attach great importance to the fact that the neutral countries are not responding to Hitler. The Times reported that "the authorities of countries in the Eastern and Western hemispheres proposed mediation to Hitler six weeks ago. At this time, Hitler is looking for a key person in the neutral countries who believes in the value of his peace talks to come forward to mediate, in order to end the war. However, the general public knows that this move will not succeed and are hesitant to act. Therefore, for the sake of the democratic countries, there is no other way but to strengthen the determination to eliminate the main obstacle to peace in Europe (referring to Hitler and his policies)." The Daily Telegraph also spoke of the silence of the neutral countries, and its conclusion was that the democratic countries should fight to the end. The News Chronicle reported that "Hitler stretched out his left hand to us in order to consolidate his victory, but we did not accept it quickly. He is very annoyed. His planned plan is not to fight against countries of equal strength, so he expects the neutral countries to act as mediators, but in terms of the conditions he has put forward, no one is willing to come forward to mediate, even Italy has no intention of doing so. Then his isolated position is undeniable." (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Norwegian Newspapers Advocate Mediation for Peace</h3>
<p>Norwegian Capital: The Norwegian newspaper "Tidens Tegn" published an article today, reviewing in detail the German leader Hitler's parliamentary speech, and then published its opinion, saying, "If no one comes forward to mediate peace, the Norwegian Foreign Minister can take on the role of mediator and come forward to mediate European peace. We believe that Hitler's peace proposals, regarding the measures to deal with the future fate of Poland, as well as the colonial demands and the plan to rebuild a new European order, can serve as the basis for negotiations. The current difficulty is that no one is taking the first step to mediate the dispute. If President Roosevelt and Mussolini both have doubts, then the Norwegian Foreign Minister may as well try." (9th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers Attack Soviet Leaders</h3>
<p>Rome: The Città di Padova newspaper recently published an editorial, vehemently attacking the leaders of the Soviet government, especially General Voroshilov, People's Commissar for Defense, saying, "General Voroshilov colludes with party members to control the Soviet Union, and wants to communize the whole world, so as to control it. A certain magazine in Rome actually praised this person in every possible way, which is wrong. In fact, Lenin and Stalin favored this person because he was an outstanding rogue and wanted to use him. We should completely ignore this person, his party members, and those who do evil in the Soviet Union, whether they praise each other or kill each other. We do not want to ask about them. The result of their killing will at most reduce the number of criminals in the world. A certain magazine that praises General Voroshilov exaggerates his deeds and forms a myth, which is even better than the Italian national hero Garibaldi. This is something that we obviously cannot tolerate. We have always been anti-communists, and we should always oppose communism. We will never add a gram of admiration or an ounce of sympathy to the Bolshevik party members. As far as we can see, these people are just pitiful clowns who make a living by mystifying, and their nature is cruel, and their bad deeds are obvious. They are the most insane and shameless liars and the most tyrannical and decadent thugs in history." People from all walks of life in Rome have commented extensively on this article in the Città di Padova newspaper. Foreign observers generally said that this is a disguised attack on Germany's current policy. Germany and Italy are going their separate ways, and the so-called Berlin-Rome axis no longer exists, which can be seen from this. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>France's Gold Reserves Total 5,000 Tons, Sufficient to Support a Long-Term War</h3>
<p>Paris: The responsible authorities recently announced that France has a huge amount of gold reserves to support a long-term war, with plenty to spare. The Bank of France has gold reserves of about 2,500 tons, and the Exchange Equalization Fund has 500 tons. In addition, the funds deposited abroad by the French people are between 70 billion and 100 billion francs, equivalent to 2,000 tons of gold by weight. The above totals 5,000 tons of gold, and the huge amount of gold coins and cash held by the people in France is not included in the calculation. When necessary in the future, France can still obtain credit loans from foreign private individuals or governments. With regard to this, the financial agreement signed by Britain and France is sufficient to supplement the military and diplomatic alliance between the two countries. It is recalled that during the First World War, that is, between 1914 and 1919, France's foreign trade had an average annual loss of 13 billion francs, with a total of 65 billion francs in five years. Among them, in addition to 8 billion francs for merchant ship freight and insurance, 13 billion francs for foreign securities held by the French people, and 16 billion francs for the expenses of the Allied forces in France, totaling 37 billion francs, which could be used for subsidies, there was a real deficit of 28 billion francs, with an average annual deficit of slightly less than 6 billion francs. At the then exchange rate of the franc, 1,600 tons of gold were lost each year. Judging from France's current resources, the prospects for a long-term war are very optimistic. However, the French government does not intend to use its savings, but to maintain the normal state of foreign trade as much as possible. With regard to this, the situation is quite favorable. On the one hand, France's foreign trade recovered its balance last year, and until the outbreak of the war last month, it had turned into a surplus. On the other hand, Britain and France are strong enough to control the ocean, and France's foreign trade will not be hindered in any way. In short, France will use the foreign exchange earned from export trade to purchase military supplies, and use its national savings as a backing. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain and Germany Consolidate Economic Fronts</h3>
<p>Danish Capital: The Danish economic delegation that was sent to London nine days ago will return here this morning and will visit Danish Minister of Commerce Kjærbol to report on the results of the negotiations. (9th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the commercial negotiations between Britain and Belgium, the Information Department recently issued a communique stating that "the Belgian commercial delegation has made significant progress after coming to London to negotiate with the British authorities. The German radio station issued a message saying that the negotiations have broken down and that the purpose of the negotiations is to leniently inspect the merchant ships of a certain neutral country, all of which are completely inaccurate. In fact, the goal of the negotiations is to minimize the temporary adverse effects that the British lock-in policy may have on Belgium. The British government is willing to maintain the most friendly relations with Belgium, but all contraband goods destined for Germany, even if they pass through Belgium, will be intercepted. In short, after Britain stepped up the implementation of the blockade policy, the various problems it caused were extremely complex. It is not possible to find a solution in one fell swoop. Therefore, the Belgian delegation has recently returned home to ask the Belgian government for instructions, and will come here again in a few days." (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Belgian Capital: The German side transmitted a message saying that the commercial negotiations between the British and Belgian representatives in London have broken down.

<h3>Germany Unable to Purchase American Kerosene</h3>
<p>Washington - According to a report submitted today by the American commercial attaché in Germany to the State Department, since the outbreak of the European war, Germany has been unable to import kerosene from Western Hemisphere countries such as the Dutch East Indies, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela. As a result, Germany's four-year economic self-sufficiency plan will inevitably be affected and undergo changes. The economic agreement concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union is the first step in the alteration of Germany's four-year economic self-sufficiency plan.

Even fighter planes are being continuously exported to foreign countries in exchange for raw materials and food. (Haitong dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>German Warships Intercept Swedish Ships</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - It has recently come to light that two Swedish ships, the "Freden" and the "Swangen," have been intercepted by German warships and forced to dock at the port of Kiel for inspection. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen - The Danish newspaper Politiken reprinted a warning from the German Flensburg Daily opposing neutral countries' ships joining British and French convoys. It stated that if merchant ships travel under the protection of enemy warships, the rules of intercepting ships for inspection and not sinking ships without warning will not apply. This applies not only to enemy convoys protected by enemy warships but also to ships of neutral countries joining convoys. According to German prize regulations, neutral ships escorted by their own country's warships must not be intercepted and inspected. However, the convoy commander can be asked to provide guarantees and detailed information about the ships and their cargo. If neutral countries are willing to take the trouble of escorting their own ships and pay the costs, the German High Command welcomes it. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Germany Launches "Propaganda Offensive" - Loudspeakers Installed Beside Cannons</h3>
<p>Paris - Responsible officials have recently received news from the front lines stating that Germany launched a "propaganda offensive" yesterday. Large loudspeakers have been installed beside all machine guns and anti-tank guns in several positions on the Siegfried Line. When the artillery ceases firing, important sections of the speech delivered by German head of state Hitler in the German parliament on the sixth of this month will be transmitted across "no man's land" to the French army positions. Upon hearing this, the French soldiers found it amusing, considering the tone almost as comical as that of the famous French film star Fernandel. Soon after, artillery fire resumed between the two armies, and the broadcast sound was cut off. This is the first time Germany has used loudspeakers for propaganda. However, since the start of the war, many posters have been erected along the entire line, prominently displaying the words "Please do not shoot German friends." These posters have mostly been destroyed by French artillery fire. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Finnish Representatives Arrive in Moscow - Soviet Union Demands Rights to Three Islands - Red Army Enters Estonia - Italy Safeguards Southeastern European Interests</h3>
<p>Helsinki, Finland - The government has officially announced that the Finnish ambassador to Sweden, J.K. Paasikivi (former Prime Minister), has been ordered to go to Moscow to negotiate political and economic issues with the Soviet government. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko recently told a Reuters reporter, regarding the Soviet Union's demand for three small islands in the Gulf of Finland and the Finnish government's decision to send former Prime Minister Paasikivi to Moscow to negotiate economic and political issues, "I am unaware of any land demands from the Soviet Union. We are treating this with a calm attitude. As for talks for the benefit of both countries, this is a very common thing." (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam, Netherlands - The newspaper Het Volk recently carried a dispatch from its correspondent in Stockholm, Sweden, stating that the Soviet government is about to demand that Finland cede the Åland Islands, the port of Hanko (the largest port in southwestern Finland), and the island of Hogland (in the Gulf of Finland) to the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London - Following the Soviet Union's demand that Finland cede three small islands in the Gulf of Finland, the Baltic countries are now paying close attention to future developments. These three islands are located 110 miles west of Leningrad. In 1788, Russia and Sweden fought a decisive battle here. Finland now intends to negotiate, so it has sent its ambassador to Sweden, Paasikivi, to Moscow to discuss issues of an economic and political nature. Paasikivi is Finland's most capable diplomat. After Finland's independence in 1918, he served as Prime Minister. In 1920, Paasikivi served as Finland's chief representative and drafted the Treaty of Tartu, which defined the Russian-Finnish border and ceded the Petsamo province on the Arctic Ocean coast to Finland. Observers generally welcome Finland's appointment of Paasikivi as special envoy, believing that the negotiations will mostly involve commercial issues, as Paasikivi is currently the chairman of the Finnish Foreign Trade Association and a prominent figure in Nordic economics and politics. It is said that Finland may ultimately agree to the Soviet Union's demands and cede the worthless islands to the Soviet Union. However, Finland's current attitude is quite firm. Finland is not a Baltic country but a part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, and its terrain is strategically not weak. Finland also has strong defenses. Sweden is also watching this matter closely. A critic told a Reuters correspondent in Sweden, "Germany has not demanded anything from us, but what will the Soviet Union do to occupy Finland?" (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Germans Sent Back Home from the Baltic States</h3>
<p>Berlin - According to authoritative German sources, German nationals and German minorities in Estonia and Latvia will soon return to Germany to live.

<h3>French Commentary on the Baltic Situation</h3>
<p>Paris - According to the latest news received here, the Soviet Union's intention is clearly to completely eliminate Germany's power in the Baltic coastal areas and arrange everything to make it impossible for Germany to invade the Baltic coastal countries. As a result, the non-aggression pacts signed between Germany and these countries in June of this year are completely invalidated. It is reported that the Soviet government has consulted with Lithuania and asked it to allow Soviet troops to pass through the country in wartime. It is also rumored that the Soviet Union will demand the construction of a defense line near the German border in that country. In addition, there is a very noteworthy point: the Germans living in Latvia have begun to return to Germany. Although the Latvian authorities say that this move is because German head of state Hitler recently gave a speech advocating the exchange of minorities with Eastern and Southeastern European countries, in reality, these Germans began to leave Latvia the day after Hitler gave his speech. People generally believe that this move is stipulated by an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, intending to allow the Soviet Union to do whatever it wants in the Baltic coastal countries. The migration of Germans to Latvia dates back to before the 13th century and has always been the vanguard of Germany's eastward expansion. Now, their voluntary withdrawal shows that Germany has given up all hope in that area. As for Finland, according to informed diplomatic sources, although the country was not quick to accept the Soviet Union's invitation to send representatives to Moscow for negotiations, and even mobilized some reserve forces, it finally decided to send its ambassador to Sweden, Paasikivi, to Moscow. However, what demands the Soviet Union will make are still unknown. It is expected that the demilitarization of the Åland Islands will definitely be among the demands. This is not only a source of great anxiety for the Finnish people, but also for the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris - Today, Parisian newspapers strongly criticized Hitler's retreat to Soviet imperialism, saying that German policy is now continuing to be constrained by Soviet demands. Pertinax stated in the Ordre newspaper that the German government's order for the mass migration of German residents in Latvia shows Hitler's fear of Stalin. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Internal Unrest in Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - Since the Croats reached a compromise with the government in September of this year, the leader of the Croats, Dr. Maček, has joined the cabinet and holds the position of Assistant Minister. However, extremist elements of the Croat people do not agree with this and have recently repeatedly caused trouble in many parts of Croatia. Many police officers have been beaten and insulted. Croats and Serbs who support cooperation with the central government have had to leave the province and take refuge in the capital. Among them, the incident that occurred in the city of Garilovac in the province four days ago was the most serious. Many Croat reservists publicly held demonstrations after receiving conscription orders, refusing to obey the orders. The military police were dispatched to suppress them before they submitted, but it caused a commotion and many people were injured. According to subsequent investigations, this incident was purely caused by the incitement of Croat extremists, because that faction absolutely does not want to reach any agreement with the central government and calls Dr. Maček a traitor. Their intention is that the only solution to the Croat problem is for Croatia to declare complete independence and break away from Yugoslavia, even if the province is placed under foreign protection, like the Slovak Autonomous Region. They express great admiration for the notorious Yugoslav terrorist group "Ustaše" (members of the group assassinated Yugoslav King Alexander I in Marseille, France, on October 9, 1934). Regarding the agreement reached by Dr. Maček and the government, they said that the first consequence of this move was that the government summoned a large number of Croat reservists into the army and extended various military precautionary measures to Croatia. In addition, agitators of the Croat people are conducting propaganda in the countryside, falsely claiming that the central government wants to drive the Croats to fight against Germany. The refusal of reservists in Garilovac to answer the call for conscription used the phrase "the government wants to send them to the French front to fight" as a pretext, thus seeing that behind the scenes, they are actually being manipulated by German propaganda personnel. However, when the Italian radio station recently issued news about this turmoil, it was not without exaggeration. According to foreign observers, the number of dissenting elements among the Croats is actually very small. The leader of the Croats, Dr. Maček, still maintains great prestige in Croatia. Since the Garilovac incident, he has come here to discuss follow-up measures with Minister of the Army General Nedić and Minister of the Interior Mihajlović, and decided to take all necessary measures to inform the people of the government's decision to strictly maintain neutrality in the current war.

<h3>Fierce Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over the North Sea - One German Plane Shot Down</h3>
<p>London - Regarding the fierce air battle between British and German planes over the North Sea yesterday, the Ministry of Information has reissued a message stating that a total of two German fighter planes and three British reconnaissance planes participated in the air battle. The pilot of one of the British planes spotted an enemy plane flying at high altitude and immediately opened up the throttle, ascended to the upper layer, and strafed with machine guns. The enemy plane also returned fire with machine guns. Soon after, another enemy plane arrived, and two British reconnaissance planes quickly rushed to the scene, thus gaining the upper hand. One of the enemy planes was shot down into the sea. The remaining one, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, fled in panic. Two British planes were hit by several bullets, but there was no major damage, and none of the pilots were killed or injured. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>German Troops Attack East Bank of the Moselle River - Repelled</h3>
<p>Paris - General Headquarters issued Battle Report No. 69, stating, "Our army launched an attack on the east bank of the Moselle River today and was repelled. In addition, artillery battles occurred south and southwest of Saarlouis." (Agence Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - According to a dispatch from the Paris Matin correspondent on the Swiss border, a large number of German troops are concentrated on the right bank of the Rhine from Lake Constance to Basel. This large army will be used to support the offensive along the Rhine River from Basel to Strasbourg. This offensive will not be launched until the Germans have fully understood the results of their "peaceful offensive." At the same time, residents of all German towns and villages 16 miles behind the right bank of the Rhine have now been evacuated. Also, according to an article by Maurice Prax in the Petit Parisien, German troops have increased their activity on the Western Front. In the past 24 hours, German troops have continued to send out patrols to venture into reconnaissance in various areas. After one team was repelled, the second team appeared immediately. But there is no change in the battle lines. Prax believes that this activity may foreshadow a German offensive in the area north of Guenvillers. He believes that the German side is very willing to announce as soon as possible that German troops have entered French Lorraine. This offensive will cause battles along the entire line, and the German military actions will eventually turn into ordinary battles between the two sides' artillery emplacements. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command issued the following brief official report at noon today: (1) On the Eastern Front, the advance toward the demarcation line of the spheres of interest continues. (2) On the Western Front, there were only some small artillery battles. (3) The air force is limited to reconnaissance activities. (Haitong dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris - Responsible officials have recently received news from the front lines stating that scouting parties from the French and German armies were very active yesterday. Enemy artillery batteries also bombarded our heavy artillery positions. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris - Today, the French military announced that there has been continuous activity of infantry, tanks, and artillery batteries in the Saarlouis area, Saarbrücken, and near the mouth of the Nied River. According to news received by M. Jean, German troops have switched to the offensive, but the scope of their activities is very small, apparently to capture French soldiers, probe the French High Command's military plans, and test French military strength.

<h3>British Government to Implement Food Rationing System</h3>
<p>London - The British government will implement some kind of food rationing system this autumn and is actively seeking to ensure its sufficient supply. According to a notice from the Ministry of Food, from today onwards, anyone selling various foods such as meat, canned food, cereals, and daily produce must obtain a special license. It also stated that the stored products of all margarine and cooking oil factories have now been requisitioned by the government. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>London - A German radio station broadcast this morning, attacking Switzerland, criticizing it for not engaging in anti-German propaganda, and stating that Swiss radio stations are merely mouthpieces for British propaganda. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Germany Actively Fortifying the Belgian Border</h3>
<p>Paris - It is reported that German troops are currently actively fortifying the border north of Luxembourg and along the Belgian border to Hochscheid. A small fort in one location has been rebuilt into a 300-foot-long concrete and steel-reinforced bunker with a steel turret housing a rapid-firing gun. Behind this bunker is a huge compressed gas storage tank, used to resist enemy soldiers breaking through the forward positions. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Reconstruction Work in Warsaw Will Take Time</h3>
<p>Danzig - According to a dispatch from the correspondent of the newspaper Narodowiec, Warsaw has been completely destroyed, and it is doubtful whether we can restore it to its original state. Reconstruction work will take time. At present, tens of thousands of residents are homeless and at risk of freezing and starvation. Many magnificent churches and palaces have been reduced to rubble. However, the former residence of the first Polish president, the late Marshal Piłsudski, Belweder Palace, was undamaged. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Mexico to Withdraw from League of Nations</h3>
<p>Mexico: According to today's political circles, the Mexican Senate has initiated a movement to withdraw from the League of Nations, and will request the Mexican President to implement it.

<h3>New Subway in Berlin Opens to Traffic</h3>
<p>Berlin: A new subway line, built at a cost of 173 million marks over five years, will open to traffic in Berlin today. Berlin has ten major railway stations, and this newly built subway can directly connect the transportation of the four major stations, making a significant contribution to the convenience of travelers. The construction of this subway line was a massive and difficult project because one section of the tunnel is over five kilometers long and must pass under three railway stations. The difficulty can be imagined. This construction project employed 1,200 workers, and the aforementioned tunnel alone required 2.8 million bags of cement and 100,000 tons of steel.

<h3>Kung Hsiang-hsi and Chen Cheng Discuss the Future of the War of Resistance; Japanese Attempts End in Failure; Chinese Actions Should Be More Agile</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi, the President of the Executive Yuan of China, stated today that our celebration of the Double Tenth Festival this year is particularly grand because, at the time we celebrate our National Day, the Japanese have suffered a major defeat in northern Hunan, while our army has achieved a great victory. As for the economy, Japan is also in a situation of inevitable defeat because all their attempts to seize our resources have failed. Kung also said that because Japan has failed militarily and economically, it has repeatedly tried to use political methods to achieve its goals, and thus there are various puppet organizations. However, these "puppet organizations" cannot represent the people of China and do not have the support of the masses, so it is difficult for them to achieve their intended goals. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to an essay prepared by General Chen Cheng, Director of the Political Department, to be published on the Double Tenth Festival, although the Japanese offensive almost coincided with the outbreak of the European war, China's strategy is still one of attrition. However, Chinese actions, at this stage, should be more proactive and agile than before. At the same time, the Chinese army on each front should adopt mobile warfare tactics. Even the victory in northern Hunan was the result of using mobile warfare tactics. The true meaning of this victory lies not in the ability to secure Changsha, but in the ability to inflict a serious blow on the Japanese army. General Chen predicted that "the war will become more intense in the future." Therefore, in the coming period, "China's war of resistance may become more difficult, but after this difficult stage, China will have the opportunity to achieve final victory." According to General Chen, there is no hope for a fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese war until the situation in Europe is clear. The Sino-Japanese war is a part of the world problem and is closely related to the European problem. In order to achieve final victory, China must maintain a strong military force in order to launch an effective general counter-offensive when the time is ripe. Finally, General Chen said that the pioneers who created the Republic of China had neither weapons nor funds, but they were able to overthrow the "Manchu Qing" simply because they had a "fearless revolutionary spirit." "As for us, whether in terms of military equipment or funds, we are far better than the pioneers who created the Republic of China. Therefore, as long as we continue to resist the war, the final victory will surely belong to us." (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui Issued a Proclamation Yesterday; Implementing National Spiritual Mobilization; Striving for World Peace</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui issued the following proclamation to the people of the country here today for the Double Tenth National Day tomorrow: "We have been resisting the war for three years. Our goal, as mentioned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, is to seek the independence and freedom of the Republic of China and international peace and justice. In terms of domestic affairs, twenty-eight years ago, we fought under the leadership of Premier Sun Yat-sen to establish the Republic of China. Twenty-eight years later today, we are fighting under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to defend this Republic. Although time has changed, our goal of struggle is the same, that is, to promote the realization of the Three Principles of the People by revolutionary methods. Although the enemy is extremely stubborn and brutal, we all have faith in the final victory, just as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, 'The importance of spiritual conditions in our war of resistance far exceeds that of material conditions.' In order to strengthen the internal unity of the country, we must implement national spiritual mobilization. In terms of diplomacy, since the Lugou Bridge Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has declared to the world that 'the Sino-Japanese war is related to all countries in the world' because the Japanese invasion of China violates the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the result is that the peace and order of the Far East and the world are completely destroyed. Japan has always advocated the 'Anti-Communist Group,' and has been doing so even more in recent years. At the same time, it claims to build a 'New Order in East Asia,' but in fact, Japan not only disrupts order in East Asia, but has also destroyed the order of the whole world. Before the Mukden Incident in 1931, all parts of the world were in a relatively peaceful, safe, and prosperous state. After the Mukden Incident, all countries in the world quickly prepared for war. The historical evidence of Japan's destruction of world peace and order is everywhere. We deeply hope that our friendly countries, which have given us great sympathy and assistance in the past, will pay attention to these facts and prevent Japan's aggression from expanding further. What I would like to point out here is that China, in the past two years, has spared no sacrifice and has struggled for world peace. As a result of its efforts to resist the war, it has exposed Japan's weaknesses. As Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in his speech at the Fourth Plenary Session of the National Political Council, 'The enemy has long been showing signs of fatigue, and its internal support is also empty. Therefore, from a military point of view, Japan has already been defeated.'" (Associated Press, 9th)</p>

<h3>Japan Plans to Sign Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union; Foreign Ministry Quietly Awaits Developments; Japan in Contact with Soviet Union Regarding Freight</h3>
<p>Tokyo: When Germany previously signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, Japan regarded it as undermining the anti-communist goals of the Tripartite Pact. However, as of today, Japan is also planning to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Those who advocate signing a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union believe that after this pact is concluded, Japan can devote all its efforts to the war against China. They also say that since the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression pact with Germany, it can turn its attention to the East at any time and make things difficult for Japan. Therefore, Japan should seize the opportunity to conclude a non-aggression pact with it as soon as possible. However, many Japanese who dislike communist ideology and distrust the Soviet government do not advocate signing a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. These Japanese all believe that if the Soviet Union continues to aid the Chiang regime, even if a non-aggression pact is concluded with the Soviet Union, it will be useless because the purpose of the Soviet Union's aid to Chiang is to sabotage Japan. However, the Foreign Ministry is now quietly watching the development of the international situation in order to open up Japan's isolated position. According to a 1931 report, the Soviet Union once suggested to Japan to conclude a non-aggression pact. At that time, Japan rejected the Soviet Union's proposal outright. The reason was that since there was a Kellogg-Briand Pact, there was no need to conclude a non-aggression pact, and that there was no room to discuss a non-aggression treaty before various pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union were resolved. In 1935, when Hirota was the Foreign Minister, his attitude was even more resolute. Before the pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, such as the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the demarcation of "Manchukuo" and Mongolia, and the fishing rights in northern Sakhalin, were resolved, Japan had no possibility of concluding a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Since the outbreak of the European war, due to the interruption of maritime transport, the export of soybeans from "Manchukuo" to Germany and Italy could not be started. As a result, the export of soybeans from "Manchukuo" will decrease by 70 million Japanese yen, which will be a major loss in foreign exchange income. Therefore, the South Manchuria Railway Company and the "Manchukuo Government" are in contact with the Soviet Union to find a way to transport the soybeans to Germany and Italy via the Siberian Railway in order to save this loss. However, according to merchants, although negotiations are in progress, it is questionable whether the Soviet Union is willing to transport such a large quantity of soybeans. Furthermore, it is also questionable whether railway transportation is worthwhile due to the long journey. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>Internal Turmoil in Japanese Foreign Ministry; Nomura's Compromise Plan Rejected Again by Subordinates</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The internal turmoil in the Foreign Ministry, which was caused by the Cabinet's decision to establish a Ministry of Trade, still shows no signs of an early resolution because the attitude of the staff of the ministry is still very strong. Last night, the administrative officers held a meeting to discuss the matter for a long time, and finally rejected the compromise plan offered by Foreign Minister Nomura, deciding to still demand the unification of political and economic diplomacy. Later, because the Foreign Minister claimed that if there was an alternative solution that would not prejudice the Cabinet's decision to establish a Ministry of Trade, he would be happy to consider it. Therefore, the administrative officers drafted a solution and submitted it to Foreign Minister Nomura at 2:00 a.m. today. However, it is still doubtful whether the Foreign Minister can accept this solution because it will ultimately overturn the Cabinet's decision. According to the Asahi Shimbun, some senior diplomats may step in to mediate, fearing that the affairs of the Foreign Ministry will be suspended. The Hochi Shimbun reports that the Privy Council attaches great importance to this matter and is gradually asking Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Nomura about the legitimacy of establishing a Ministry of Trade. The Kokumin Shimbun reports that all embassies and consulates abroad support the claims of the Foreign Ministry staff and have sent telegrams to encourage them. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News of the War in the Chao-Shan Area; Japanese Army Secretly Transfers Han Chinese to Reinforce; Chinese Air Force Deploys to Assist in Battle; Mutual Contention for Various Points in Chao'an</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese army has recently been making every effort to invade southern Hubei and northern Hunan. The Japanese army stationed in Guangdong was also transferred out last month, boarding ships at Huangpu and Nanao at night and secretly transported to Hankou, replacing them with puppet troops from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to fill the defenses in eastern Guangdong.</p>
<p>The Chinese Air Force's Condor Squadron dispatched bombers to the sea off Raoping Nanao on the morning of September 29 and turned to reconnaissance in the Haifeng Dapeng Bay area. Thirty to forty ships have been transporting military supplies there for days. Upon seeing the Chinese Air Force arrive, they scattered in panic, in a great state of disarray.</p>
<p>The war in Chao-Shan is becoming increasingly tense. The Chinese regular army is advancing towards Chao-Shan from Jieyang and Fengshun. After the Japanese army in Anbu, Shantou, was defeated in an attack on Sangpu Mountain on September 26, they moved troops to Nanao on the 28th, using warships to cover the attack on Tuolin Haishan in Raoping, and were again defeated by the local militia. They are still eager to try and attempt to land on the coast of Hailufeng to attack Jieyang Hepo and penetrate into Wuhua Zijin, in order to encircle the rear of the Chinese army in Chao-Shan.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Chao'an City has been unable to break through for more than ten days because the land and water transportation on the tributary of the Han River and the dike road has been cut off. Various outposts around Chao'an, such as Zhugao Mountain, Bijia Mountain, Jin Mountain, Hulu Mountain, and the foot of Siwei Mountain, are full of Chinese troops, vying for the mountain top positions. The Japanese artillery on the mountain peaks fire blindly every day. Because the Chinese Air Force often bombs the mountain, Chinese plainclothes teams are now active inside and outside Chao'an City. Two Japanese army camps in Donghua Street, east of the East Gate, were burned down on the night of the 28th. At about 4:00 a.m. on the 29th, the warehouse built by the Japanese army in Xifeng Street, west of the West Gate, also suddenly caught fire. All the military supplies stored in the warehouse were burned. The Chinese daredevil team took the opportunity to rush into the Japanese camp, engaged in battle with the mountain patrolling Japanese army, and used hand grenades and broadswords to kill more than ten Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>At 11:00 a.m. on the 29th, three Japanese planes flew to Chao'an City and dropped mail packages and dry food, and then flew to the mountains of Fengjie to spy. When flying over Fengkou, the Chinese army opened fire, and the Japanese planes also flew low and fired machine guns in retaliation. They held out for thirty minutes before leaving. When passing Sangpu Mountain, they dropped two bombs on the mountain rocks. It is heard that Heyuan was bombed by Japanese planes twice. Seven bombs fell on Zhongshan Park, and the losses are unknown.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Reinforcements Attack Shenzhen; Japanese Bombers Fly into British Airspace</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Chinese army counterattacking Shenzhen began to attack the Japanese army in Shi'an late on the night of the 30th of last month. A previous dispatch has been recorded. The Japanese army in Shenzhen Nantou and other places stubbornly resisted. At 7:00 a.m. on the 1st of this month, the war was declared to be easing. During the fierce battle for two days, the Japanese army sent planes to assist in the battle, bombing the Chinese army's positions. The Chinese army launched a surprise counterattack. The areas along the coast of Houhai Bay from Shatou to Shatoujiao in Matu Bay were all destinations for their counterattack. The Japanese army stationed in the villages between Shatoujiao in Shenzhen is expected to have been completely wiped out. By the afternoon of the 2nd, the sound of artillery was heard again in the area along the Sino-British border. The sound of artillery was most intense between Shatou Shenzhen in Houhai Bay. The sound of artillery, machine guns, and rifles could be heard very clearly on the border of Hong Kong. The Chinese army claimed that the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in the battle on the 1st. The Chinese army once entered Shenzhen on that day, but withdrew immediately to avoid heavy losses because the Japanese planes were bombing. Most parts of Shenzhen were on fire.</p>
<p>At present, Chinese reinforcements are flowing from Huiyang to Shenzhen. Two Japanese transport ships are carrying Japanese soldiers, attempting to land in Daya Bay to prevent the Chinese army from advancing towards Shenzhen. In Nantou, the regular army has also joined forces with the guerrillas and is counterattacking the Japanese army. The contact between the Japanese army in Nantou and Shenzhen has been cut off. Japanese planes have been dispatched to assist in the battle for two days, but the sky is overcast and the weather is bad, making it impossible to detect the Chinese army's positions. At around 3:00 p.m. on the 2nd, a Japanese plane flew over the British airspace of Shatoujiao. The plane was dark gray with a red sun symbol painted under its wings, and flew low at an altitude of 400 feet. There were two pilots on the plane. After circling twice in the sky, it flew back to the Chinese territory of Shatoujiao and then flew towards Yantian.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Launches Large-Scale Attack on Xicheng Counties</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle Stopped After Four or Five Hours</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: On the 5th of this month, the New Fourth Army and the 2nd and 4th Detachments of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army from various towns and villages in Wuxi Jiangyin counties, Zhutang River, Xiangqiao, Mazhen, and Meicun, attacked the Japanese troops of Shino, Miyake, and Kawashima in Xicheng counties. The two sides fought fiercely for four or five hours, from dawn to about 11:00 a.m., before stopping. The Japanese side also added the Yinshan artillery team, firing artillery indiscriminately. The battle line extended to Mazhen in the southern countryside of Jiangyin and Yanqiao in Wuxi. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 100 casualties, and the Chinese side also suffered considerable sacrifices.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Japanese Army Tries Air Raid Alarm</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: At 9:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. on the 5th of this month, air raid alarms were suddenly heard near the Wuxi Railway Station and outside Guangfu Gate, four times in total. The people were horrified. After investigation, it was found that the alarm system was installed by the Japanese army in a silk factory and had been there for a long time. This was a test run.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Coastal Fishing Boats Devastated; From Late August to Mid-September; More Than 1,000 Fishing Boats Intercepted and Burned by Japanese Warships; Fishermen's Losses Exceed One Million</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: In recent days, Japanese warships on the Min-Yue sea have been moving towards the Huizhou coast. It is now the fishing season, and fishermen along the coast are forced to risk going out to sea to fish for a living. Many have gone and never returned. It is reported that from late August to mid-September, more than 1,000 fishing boats were burned, with losses exceeding one million. Off the coast of Tanganshan, Hong Kong, six fishing boats were chased by Japanese rubber boats a few days ago. The fishermen fought back with indigenous cannons, sinking three rubber boats and killing or wounding more than 20 Japanese soldiers. But later, several fishing boats were pursued and captured by Japanese warships and burned near the Wanshan Islands, and many fishermen were killed. Near Hongmeihai Bay, Shantou, there is a tragic scene of fishermen firing cannons to resist the war every day. There are often burned hulls and corpses floating on the sea.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Xuzhou Very Weak</h3>
<p>Huaihai Japanese Army Retreats to Xuzhou, Pei County Armies in Large-Scale Mixed Battle</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: In recent days, the Japanese army in northern Huaihai has been retreating from the Hai Zheng Highway to Xuzhou, with as many as 200 people or as few as dozens of people every day, for a total of about 2,000 people. There are also prostitutes, children, furniture, and miscellaneous items, all taking the train in Xuzhou to Qingdao via the Jinpu Railway or the Longhai Railway at any time. The more than 20,000 Japanese troops recently stationed in Xuzhou were from the Washizu Division, which was withdrawn from eastern Henan, northern Jiangsu, and the Haizhou area, and was ordered in early September to be transported to Guanwai via the Jinpu North Road and Longhai East Road. At present, the total number of Japanese troops stationed in Xuzhou is no more than 2,000. It is also heard that the puppet troops in Xuzhou, led by Chen Ning, Kang Jintao, Hu Li, and Li Guanying, have been successively resolved by the Japanese army. At present, there are only more than 250 puppet "Suburban Republic Army Commander Liu Fulong's troops, who are stationed with the Japanese army in the eastern section of Longhai to maintain the road. The Japanese army in Pei County recently attacked without success and have fled back to their strongholds. County Chief Feng then sent Regiment Commander Zhang ×× of the ×th Regiment to lead three major battalions and one company of the training battalion to the southern section of the Pei Tong Road, taking the opportunity to attack the Japanese army, stationing in the third section of Tongshan District, Meicun Tongchang, and other places. At dawn on September 13, more than 300 Japanese troops from Zhengji via Maozhai took 18 cars and 8 tanks, and turned to Dongfu, dividing into three routes to harass. One route to the Chinese army in Meicun drove to Xindi. The Chinese army's sentry immediately fired to block their advance. Zhang, the battalion commander stationed in Meicun, also led two detachments to resist strongly. The Japanese army used tanks and machine guns to press on Zhang's battalion, with fierce firepower. Zhang's dog team retreated back into the village, occupying civilian houses. Taking advantage of the Japanese army's dispersal, they launched a heroic and bloody charge. Later, the Japanese army advanced from both wings, using chariots for cover and concentrating firepower, taking the village with a large encirclement. At that time, the situation between the Chinese and Japanese armies was quite different. The various units of the Chinese army stationed in Tongchang in the third section rushed to the rescue, breaking through the encirclement and retreating to Xuzhuang in Tongshan District. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered dozens of casualties, and Chinese officers and soldiers also made heroic sacrifices.</p>

<h3>National High School Teaching Staff Numbers (Part 1) Growing Annually to Over Eleven Thousand People, More Schools Reduced Than Increased During Wartime</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Special Dispatch) The Ministry of Education recently compiled detailed statistics on the overall situation of teaching staff in specialized schools and above before and after the war. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Pre-War Situation</p>
<p>The number of teaching staff in specialized schools and above generally increased or decreased with the number of schools. In the first year of the Republic of China, there were 2,312 teachers. By the 17th year, there were 5,214 teachers. This was because there were only four universities and 21 specialized schools in the first year of the Republic of China. Although the number of specialized schools decreased to 25 in the 17th year, the number of universities increased to 49. Universities are more complex than specialized schools, and naturally require more teachers. From the 17th to the 20th year, the number of specialized schools and above increased from 75 to 103, so the number of teachers also increased from 2,314 to 7,053. Starting in the 21st year, restrictions were placed on the establishment of schools specializing in liberal arts, and the number of teachers decreased slightly as a result. After the 21st year, the number of students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine increased, and the number of teachers required for each subject also gradually increased. Therefore, although the total number of students was less than the number of students in the 20th year due to the decrease in the number of liberal arts students, the number of teachers still increased with the number of students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine. By the 25th year, the number of teachers had reached 7,560. The number of staff in specialized schools and above was not fully investigated before the 17th year. Since the 17th year, it has also increased annually. In the 17th year, the number of staff in specialized schools and above was 2,913, which increased to 5,421 in the 25th year. If the number of staff and teachers is combined, and the number of staff and teachers who held both positions is subtracted, the actual number of staff and teachers was 7,669 in the 17th year, which increased year by year to 11,850 in the 25th year.</p>
<p>Now, comparing the number of teaching staff and students each year since the 17th year, the number of teachers per 100 students was the highest in the 18th year, with 22 teachers. The 20th and 21st years were the lowest, with 16 teachers. The number of staff per 100 students was the highest in the 18th and 23rd years, with 13 staff. The 19th and 20th years were the lowest, with only 10 staff. If the number of teaching staff is combined, and the number of staff and teachers who held both positions is subtracted, and then compared with the number of students, the number of teaching staff per 100 students was the highest in the 18th year, with 33 teaching staff. The 20th and 21st years were the lowest, with 24. Generally, the number of teaching staff was higher in the 17th and 18th years. After the 19th year, the situation in each school became more stable, so the number of teaching staff also gradually decreased. After the 22nd year, the increase in the number of teaching staff was actually due to the increase in the number of schools and departments. In addition, for some departments that focus on research, although students are not enthusiastic about studying, the number of teachers in specialized subjects cannot be reduced. This is also a common fact. However, judging from the number of teaching staff per 100 students in the 17th and 18th years, the number of teaching staff per 100 students in each school in recent years is still decreasing, which shows that each school is now more careful in selecting and hiring teaching staff.</p>
<p>Wartime Situation</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Incident, specialized schools and above in Peiping and Tianjin were the first to be suspended. Only a few schools managed to move inland to start classes. Due to the expansion of the war zone, specialized schools and above in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai, Nanjing, Peiping, Tianjin, and other provinces and cities either moved inland or tended to be suspended. Because the schools themselves moved around, teaching staff were restricted by family ties and various transportation difficulties. On the other hand, due to the changes in the schools themselves, the number of teaching staff required changed. Therefore, the difference in the increase or decrease in the number of teaching staff in each school was very large. Regarding the number of teaching staff in specialized schools and above in the 26th year, based on the materials obtained, there was a significant change in the number of teaching staff in 70 schools, including National Central University, compared with the number in the 25th year. In the 26th year, the number of teaching staff increased in 17 schools, including National Sun Yat-sen University, Wuhan University, Hunan University, Sichuan University, Jiaotong University, Yunnan University, Shanghai Medical College, Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College, Tongji University, Guangxi University, Sichuan Provincial Education Institute, Private Sino-French University, Lingnan University, Fujian Union Theological College, Wuchang Central China University, Hwa Nan Women's College, and Tong De Medical College. Among them, the Sichuan Provincial Education Institute had the largest increase, with 70 teaching staff in the 26th year, an increase of 34 from the 25th year. The National Shanghai Medical College had 159 people, an increase of 72 from the 25th year. Yunnan University had 98 people, an increase of 40 from the previous year. As for the schools where the number of teaching staff in the 26th year decreased compared with the 25th year, there were 53 schools among the 70 schools investigated. Among them, the number of teaching staff decreased by more than seven-tenths in Jinan University, from 196 to 58 people; Shanghai Law School, from 49 to 10 people; Soochow University, from 89 to 23 people; and Xinhua Art College, from 57 to 12 people. The number of teaching staff decreased by more than two-thirds in Wuxi Chinese Studies College, from 34 to 10 people. In total, the number of teaching staff in 70 schools, including National Central University, was 9,241 in the 25th year, which decreased to 7,147 in the 26th year. The schools that increased had a total increase of 779 people, while the schools that decreased had a total decrease of 2,873 people. Comparing the increase and decrease, there was still a shortage of 2,094 people.</p>
<p>Judging from the number of teaching staff in 70 schools, including National Central University, in the 26th year, it can be seen that the number of teaching staff in public schools mostly increased. Of the 17 schools where the number of teaching staff increased in the 26th year, national schools accounted for nine, and provincial schools accounted for two. Secondly, the number of teaching staff in inland schools, such as Xiangda, Chuanda, Guid, and Wuda, increased more. This was probably due to the increase in the number of students in various inland areas and the fact that teaching staff moved inland to avoid the war. On the contrary, the number of teaching staff in private schools and areas in or near the war zone decreased compared with the 25th year. The reason for the decrease in the number of teaching staff in some private schools in the 26th year was actually due to economic hardship and a decrease in the number of students, and the hiring of teachers was inevitably tightened. This was not only the case for private schools, but some public schools in the war zone also dismissed teaching staff due to economic constraints. Observing the increase or decrease in the number of teaching staff in these 70 schools, it can be seen that the total number of teaching staff in specialized schools and above in the country in the 26th year must have decreased without a doubt. The impact of the war caused some teaching staff in specialized schools and above to lose their jobs as a result. Although the Ministry of Education had other relief measures for this, it was still an intangible and significant loss to the country's culture. However, in the 27th year, each school had settled down after moving, the curriculum improved, and the number of teaching staff gradually returned to its former state.</p>

<h3>Western Union Football A League, Opens This Saturday, Opening Match Lido vs. North Xitong, 3:00 PM at Yiyuan Stadium</h3>
<p>The 1939-40 Western Union Football League will open this Saturday. The opening match of the first game is Group A Lido vs. North Xitong, at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Lido is a newly emerging force in the previous season. Due to the articles of association, it was relegated to Group C, but in the Scott Cup, it became a dark horse and overwhelmed the crowd. Therefore, this year, it was invited to be promoted to Group A out of the ordinary. Since the beginning of this season, good news has been reported frequently. North Xitong was the champion of Group C and the Junior Cup in the previous season. It was promoted to Group B in the previous season, and this year it was promoted to the same level as Lido. It has more courage, but lacks experience. At that time, it may not be the enemy of Lido. The referee is Shen Huichun, and the linesmen are Dai Zhicheng and Zhang Le. The order for the week is as follows:</p>
<p>Saturday (14th)</p>
<p>Lido vs. North Xitong (A) 3:00 PM Yiyuan</p>

<h3>Finance Although There Are Net Inflows, Foreign Exchange Is Still Oversupplied</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listing remained unchanged. The dark market for British and American exchange rates was as stable as it has been recently. Speculators are wary of the current market situation and dare not take any action. Most of them are waiting and seeing, and the factors affecting exchange rates are still only the actual positions of import and export merchants and foreign merchants. Throughout the day, the market opened strong, followed by Chinese banks offering more, which led to a loosening. Later, due to the net inflows from Forvourable on behalf of a certain party, the market tightened again. The British gold was 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate was 7.53125. Before long, Bi Bank came back to sell, and Sassoon and exporters also came to sell. At noon, British gold reached 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate loosened to 7.6875. In the afternoon, the situation turned dull. Only Chinese banks continued to offer slightly, which made the underlying trend stable. As a result, the closing prices were 4/51/2/2 and 7.65625, which were looser than the British and American rates on Saturday. The British rate was 0.0625, and the American rate was 0.09375, which was because the American rate against the British rate narrowed slightly. As for the futures trend, because the current environment is unfavorable, there are few buyers, so the loosening trend is more significant. According to the noon closing, the current month has already been flattened with the spot price, and the November rate has also been slightly flattened with the spot price. It is heard that someone is willing to pay a premium of 0.125 for American dollars, which amounts to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of only 1.63%. Trading was brisk in the morning and slow in the afternoon. Today is National Day, and the market is closed.</p>
<p>The Market Tightened Once Midway</p>
<p>In the early morning, there were no telegrams from London for large amounts of gold or American bank prices. The price of raw gold in London was stable. The exchange rates for British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies remained unchanged. The American rate against the British rate narrowed by half a point, fell by 5 points against Shanghai, and fell by a small half a point against French. The central listing rates for each exchange rate remained the same. Banks strictly opened spot selling prices: British gold was 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate was 7.59375, which were slightly looser by 0.015625 and slightly stronger by 0.03125 than the end of the previous week. After opening, the market continued to strengthen because Chinese banks came to offer. Chinese banks sold spot British gold to foreign banks and Huabi at 4/51/2/2 and spot American exchange rate at 7.625 and 7.65625. HSBC's listing was announced and did not move, and the balance tax on silver was also announced and did not increase or decrease. After that, Favouable Bank suddenly bought aggressively on behalf of a certain party, and foreign banks were less willing to supply, which caused the trend to tighten slightly. Forvourable Bank settled spot British gold with fellow banks at 4/51/2/2 and half a point, and spot American exchange rate at 7.59375 and 5625. Later, the American exchange rate was once called higher than 7.53125. Then, Chinese banks came to offer again, and Sassoon and exporters followed suit to sell, plus a certain American bank also had a selling interest, and Favouable's buying interest was sluggish at that time, so the situation tended to loosen again. Chinese banks, Sassoon, and exporters successively sold spot British gold to foreign banks such as HSBC and Huabi at 4/51/2/2 and 5625, and the spot American exchange rate rose from 7.5625 to 7.6875. At the same time, a certain bank also sold spot American exchange rate to Qian Duiye such as Wankang and Baocheng at 7.5625 and 625. Later, the British gold was once shouted as high as 4/51/2/2. At noon, the trading became slow, so the situation gradually leveled off. Until the noon closing, the spot selling prices of banks were: British gold at 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate at 7.65625, which were looser by 0.03125 and stronger by 0.0625 compared to the early opening.</p>
<p>Many Watched the Market Later</p>
<p>Due to the holidays, most operators watched the market. It is heard that Chinese banks continued to offer slightly, so the underlying trend was still extremely stable. Until the late closing, the spot selling prices of banks were: British gold at 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate at 7.65625. The current month's rate was similar to the previous price.</p>
<p>The November rates were: British gold at 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate at 7.53125. As a result, compared to the end of last week, the spot British rate was looser by 0.0625, and the American rate was stronger by 0.09375. The current month's British rate was looser by 0.078125, and the American rate was stronger by 0.125. The November British rate was longer by 0.09375, and the American rate was stronger by 0.125.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Exchange Market Was Calm</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 9th Telegram: The exchange market opened calmly this morning. The British and Japanese exchange rates were unchanged. The spot American exchange rate was tighter by 0.0625, at 25.125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 4 yuan, to 326 yuan. At 10:00 AM, the American exchange rate loosened by 0.0625, to 25.1875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate continued to fall by 1 yuan, to 325 yuan. The market was calm. At 2:30 PM, the market opened smoothly with no changes. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by another 1 yuan at the late closing, to 323 yuan. The market will be closed for one day on Tuesday, the Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Exchange Rate Continued to Rise</p>
<p>Tianjin, 9th Telegram: The exchange market opened with firm prices this morning. The spot British exchange rate loosened by 0.0625, to 3 pence 75. The spot American exchange rate rose by 0.125, to 6.375 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 1.5 yuan, to 117 yuan. The "Lianchao" dark market was cheaper by 1.5 yuan, to 87.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Gold Market Did Not Change Much</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold dark market situation only had half a day of trading. Because afternoon transactions are usually settled the next day, and today happened to be National Day, the industry temporarily decided to stop afternoon gatherings. The market will resume as usual on Wednesday, the 11th of this month. According to the market situation yesterday morning, there were very few changes. Generally, it fell first and then rose, but it was still slightly weak. It was entirely dependent on the loosening and tightening of foreign exchange and buying and selling. The market opened immediately affected by the loosening of the exchange market and fell to a low price of 4,030 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange market weakened. At that time, the Hong Kong group bought in, and it immediately rebounded to a high of 4,063 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange rate rebounded and hardened, and the securities group had a strong intention to sell, and it once again dropped slightly to 4,040 yuan. However, at noon, the Hong Kong group made a comeback and absorbed the market, which pulled the price up to 4,053 yuan at the close. As a result, it fell by 13 yuan compared to last Saturday. It is heard that there were some transactions outside the market in the afternoon, and the situation was slightly weak. A certain cash shop sold dozens of taels to a certain Qian Duiye on behalf of various parties, and the price dropped from 4,053 yuan to 48 yuan. However, observing that the gold price at the end of last week did not fall below the 4,000 yuan mark, it was entirely dependent on the support of the Hakka group, and it is heard that a certain agency also bought gold, so the future still depends on whether the Hakka group has the ability to continue. The half-day trading was still brisk, with more than 700 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged, and the price of customs gold remained the same.</p>
<p>The Gold Dark Market Fell Only Slightly</p>
<p>Since the price of each tael (ten taels) in the morning was initially lower due to the weakening of the foreign exchange market, and there was a lack of buyers, the opening price was reduced by 36 yuan compared to the noon closing price on Saturday. Qian Duiye sold ten taels to the securities group for 4,030 yuan. After opening, the foreign exchange rate suddenly tightened and softened, and people's hearts were agitated. There were gradually more traders, and the price gradually rose. When it was about to return to the 4,050 yuan mark, the Hong Kong group suddenly started buying, and entrusted a certain gold shop and a certain Qian Duiye to search for purchases on its behalf, which made the trend even stronger. The price was also raised by 13 yuan. The silver shop group bought ten taels from the gold shop for 4,063 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate suddenly hardened again, and the Hakka group's intention to buy faded, and the securities group's intention to sell was strong, and the situation was again unsustainable. The price fell back by 23 yuan. The securities group sold thirty taels to the gold shop for 4,040 yuan. Near noon, although the foreign exchange rate was still reported to be hard, the Hong Kong group resumed buying, and entrusted a certain gold shop to buy on its behalf, which stabilized the situation. Soon, the price was pulled up by 13 yuan. A certain gold shop bought twenty taels from Qian Duiye for 4,053 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because today (that is, the 10th) is National Day, the market was closed for one day, and the transactions made by the industry in the afternoon are usually settled the next day. Because today happens to be within the holiday period, the industry temporarily decided to stop gatherings, and the market will resume as usual on Wednesday, the 11th of this month. As a result, the noon closing price fell by 13 yuan. The fluctuations in half a day were 33 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own gold was about 10 yuan higher than the gold dark market price. The buying price had to be reduced by about 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>The Price of Gold Jewelry Remained the Same</p>
<p>Because the price of gold jewelry in silver shops fluctuated without much increase or decrease, the price remained unchanged all day. The price of Datonghang remained at the original price of 410 yuan, the price of Xinhanghang was the same as the previous price, and the buying price had to be reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cash Floods the Market, Discount Rates Cannot Be Maintained</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange and bill discount rate fell again. The initial price was slightly higher at 70 yuan per thousand yuan. Cash flooded the market, and the supply was eager. The price dropped to 65 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the price could not be maintained and once fell to 60 yuan. Finally, it rebounded slightly to 62.5 yuan, which was 5 yuan lower than last Saturday. The interest rate of the Qianye Guild remained unchanged. It is estimated that the early and late markets were still 0.19 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Fell More Than Rose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies were mixed, because the industry's thinking was erratic, so the US dollar ticket price fluctuated quite suddenly. It initially traded at 13.43 yuan, then suddenly dropped to 13.22 yuan. Near noon, it rebounded slightly to 0.28 yuan, and finally closed at 13.3 yuan. As a result, it fell by 0.15 yuan. British gold tickets and American gold pounds also fell by 0.5 yuan each. Hong Kong tickets fell by 0.03 yuan, Annam tickets fell by 0.05 yuan, Canadian tickets fell by 0.4 yuan, Australian gold tickets fell by 1 yuan, Japanese gold tickets fell by 0.02 yuan, and Korean tickets fell sharply. The final price was 1.16 yuan, which was 0.015 yuan lower. Singapore tickets rose by 0.15 yuan, Dutch tickets also rose by 0.3 yuan, Robi tickets rose by 0.1 yuan, Philippine tickets rose by 0.25 yuan, and the rest remained stable.</p>
<h3>Bank Clearing House Reduces Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>The Municipal Banking United Preparatory Committee issued a circular to all banks and firms yesterday, changing the interest rate, which took effect yesterday, and is set as follows: The interest rate on public bonds is 0.28 yuan in national currency, and the exchange rate is 0.23 yuan. The discount rate for acceptance of drafts with a 90-day term is 0.28 yuan in national currency, and the exchange rate is 0.23 yuan. The interest rate for interbank exchange is 0.23 yuan. The interest rate for interbank exchange loans remains at 0.25 yuan. The above is calculated per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<p>The aforementioned interest rate has not changed for two and a half months since it was changed on July 24. Yesterday, the national currency remained unchanged, and only the various exchange rates were reduced by 0.02 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bull Market in Securities and Domestic Debt: Strong Buying Continues</h3>
<p>Class A Surges to $56; Jardine Matheson Shares See Speculative Frenzy</p>
<p>The securities grey market continued its strong upward trend yesterday. Even after the dividend distribution of Class C shares, the upward momentum showed no signs of weakening, trading significantly higher than the draw price. Various classes of shares all broke through the $1 mark, showing a positive trend not seen in the past two to three months. This surge has been sustained for several days, with strong buying pressure continuing yesterday. Due to the market being closed today, only half a day of trading was conducted yesterday morning, but grey market trading in the afternoon remained robust. Class B shares are expected to reach the $50 mark first, followed by Class C, D, and E. The soft gold and foreign exchange environment, coupled with the continued decline in premiums, naturally leads to a gradual rise in public bonds in such favorable conditions. This is anticipated, and it is possible that prices may return to pre-June 19 levels. In yesterday's trading, Class C shares opened slightly lower due to the dividend calculation, then gradually climbed higher, eventually breaking through $48. Market sentiment was very tight. Class A shares broke through $56. It was reported that they reached over $57 in the afternoon. The strong rise in Class A shares remains the most prominent. In the half-day morning session, prices continued to rise by 4.5 to 9 dimes, with total trading volume exceeding one million dollars. A brief summary table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading saw 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange stock trade at a price of $40, up half a dollar from the previous day.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the Public Brokers Association, industrial shares in yesterday's stock market remained active and strong. Jardine Matheson shares were a major focus of public interest. Due to speculative fervor in recent weeks, the rise in this stock has been relentless, and its activity has not diminished in the slightest. In fact, it is intensifying, soaring to a high price of $50.50. At closing, bids were at $50.25, but there were still few sellers. Ewo Cotton Mill shares, which had been neglected recently, also saw a turnaround, with prices rising to $21.10. Other stocks saw little change. Rubber stock trading was sluggish and not worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Stockpilers Show Signs of Unease</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Recently, with the decline in yarn prices and the reduction in cotton cloth costs, factory prices have softened. Traders and stockpilers are showing signs of unease and are eager to sell their holdings. Coupled with cautious buying from customer groups, cloth prices have plummeted. However, popular goods and spring-selling fine yarn textiles remain stable in price, while trading in fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill is sporadic, with prices continuing to fall by one to five dimes. Local traders and wholesalers have taken advantage of the low prices to absorb some stock, with transactions including over 150 boxes of printed and dyed cloth, and nearly 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and twill. Although the prices of various types of velvets remain stable, customers are mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and transactions have also decreased to 2,000 to 3,000 bolts. New transactions with customers are rare, but orders for expedited processing remain strong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>White fine cloth and fine twill continue to decline due to weak actual sales, falling by two to three and a half dimes per bolt. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is offered at $21.25, fine twill at $20.45, and both fine cloth and fine twill at $20.75. Trading houses have not been opening new orders. Local traders have traded over 500 pieces among themselves. The "Four Gentlemen" fine woolen fabric is also experiencing sluggish sales, falling to 6 dimes 7.5 cents per yard, and straight woven to 6 dimes 8 cents.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Today, 92 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong, 10 pieces to Beihai, and 3 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Grains: New Harvest Not Yet Complete; Glutinous and Indica Rice Sales Stagnate</h3>
<p>Customer Indica Rice Sixteen to Seventeen Dollars Lower Than Highest Price</p>
<p>Yesterday, inland sources brought in 4,000 to 5,000 bags of original packages by rail. The market opened early, and local merchants, seeing the market announcement that today is Double Tenth Festival and the market would be closed for a day, mostly replenished their supplies, so the market seemed to be gathering momentum. Kiln-dried Baige was quoted at $34 to $32.50, but actual sales showed little improvement, and prices weakened again. As a result, only over 4,000 bags were traded, and the prices of various grains showed varying degrees of decline. Broken japonica rice fell by about one dollar, Changzhou-Wuxi high broken quoted at $36-37, medium at $34, new japonica rice at $32, Suzhou-Tong broken at $32-33, new japonica rice at $30, Qingjiao kiln-dried green rice at $32-33, Fengjing Baige at $31 to $30, Nangang Hexia white rice at $30, early broken at $29.50, original package broken at $32, new Yangjian at $14, determined at $22.50, Lujian special at $25, determined at $23.50, Hexia goods at $22.50, generally 3-5 dimes lower. Various customer rice varieties depreciated by more than half a dollar, Jiangbei rice at $19 to $18.50, Lujian rice at $19.50, determined at $18.20, Qi rice at $17 to $16.80, Nanguan special rice at $20, determined at $19. Aged rice also softened by about 5 dimes, aged goods at $32-33, new at $29 to $28.50, special at $30.</p>
<p>In other news, stocks of customer indica rice are gradually increasing, and new arrivals are scarce, while shipments are continuously arriving at the port. The cost of Jiangbei new indica rice at the production area is currently difficult to calculate, and Wuhu indica rice is also difficult to profit from, but stockpiles are still large and will inevitably be shipped in gradually, so the market is continuing to trend downwards. However, local merchants, after a period of wait-and-see, have decided to buy at low prices, and trading is not quiet. Yesterday's market prices again fell by half a dollar to one dollar. High indica rice is only at $19.50, determined at around $18. Qi indica rice is at around $17, and coarse indica rice is at $16-17, which is sixteen to seventeen dollars lower than the highest price last month.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Quiet; Local Traders Focus on Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: The spot flour market was very quiet yesterday. Second-grade flour mills are still holding onto their original prices of 70 dimes. Local trading is consistently sluggish. Due to the factory's urging to collect warehouse goods and requesting loss fees, customer purchases must be loaded immediately, so new transactions are even more difficult to initiate. Local traders are mostly focusing on warehouse receipts because the returned goods are cheaper than the factory price. It is heard that the prices of Lao Che Pai and Fuxin brands are quoted at 6 dollars 7 dimes 5-6 cents to 7 dimes, while the price of Bingshan brand is only quoted at 6 dollars 6 dimes to 5 dimes 5 cents. It is heard that the recent price of Japanese flour has even fallen below the 6 dollar mark in the spot market. Market prices are highly inconsistent, creating a chaotic situation. It is reported that 500 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong today. Today is the Double Tenth National Day celebration, and the market is closed for a day.</p>
<p>Wheat: The supply of wheat yesterday and the day before yesterday was not abundant, with only over 10,000 bags arriving. Traders are holding firm, and large merchants are waiting to sell at the warehouse, but factory demand is weak, making it difficult for the market to recover. The unified market saw only 4,500 bags of wheat purchased by Fufu and other factories for their Guan Dian, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Danyang, Changshu, and Pudong branches, at a price of 9 dollars 8 dimes to 3 dimes 7 cents. The market remains lacking in momentum.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Yarn Market Decline Intensifies; Three Reasons for the Sharp Drop</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues its downward trend, and the decline is intensifying. This is mainly because actual demand is stagnant and strict exchange controls have been implemented in the South China region, greatly reducing purchasing power recently. At the same time, cotton prices have shown slight softening, leading to increasingly weak sentiment. The market supply appears to be slightly abundant. General speculative bulls, seeing the unfavorable environment, are painfully liquidating their positions, causing market prices to fall sharply. However, wealthy merchants with strong financial backing are still unwilling to release their stockpiles, and the situation is still able to support them somewhat. Today is National Day, and the market is closed for a day.</p>
<p>The morning opening for spot yarn was tight, and everyone remained cautious and inactive. Although asking prices were high, there were very few buyers. Market prices fell by $19. The spot price for Shuangma was $720, while warehouse receipts were only selling for $705. Although there was some support in the middle, the fluctuations were minimal, and the market remained sluggish and listless. At closing, the spot price for 20-count Shuangma was $718, and the warehouse receipt price was $701. It is reported that 715 bales were traded in the half-day session. The price of 20-count Shuangma fell by $11, Shuangqiu fell by $24.50, Tiannv fell by $19.50, and 10-count coarse yarn also fell by more than $10. Shenxin Factory opened 1,700 bales of 10-count red Shuangma, priced at $580. The amount of spot yarn purchased by various groups is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Traders: 525 Jiangxi: 40</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 60 Ningbo: 30</p>
<p>Inland: 60 Total: 715</p>
<p>The reasons for the recent sharp decline in the yarn market are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Commodity prices in the inland regions have soared to their highest point. Cloth is closely related to people's livelihoods, so the Kunming authorities have already implemented controls.</p>
<p>(2) The Hong Kong authorities have strictly managed foreign exchange, and merchants are not allowed to remit funds abroad at will. Singapore and other places have also taken similar steps. As a result, purchasing power has been greatly restricted, which is a major factor in the lack of trading in South China. The price of 20-count Shuangma has fallen directly from $860 to $718.</p>
<p>(3) Since the outbreak of the European war, there have been few ships, and additional war risk insurance and water charges have been added, resulting in a substantial increase in costs. The converted price is particularly high. Therefore, the cost of yarn mills has soared. Although new cotton has entered the market in this country, transportation from all sides is difficult and it cannot be safely transported to Shanghai. Therefore, the opening price has gradually risen from $101 to $160. Recently, many people have been scouring for high prices in production areas and transporting them to Shanghai at risk. As a result, the arrival of goods has increased, and the market price has naturally declined, falling to $141. In addition, foreign exchange rates have been quiet and stable, with the British exchange rate often around four and a half pence. For this reason, general accumulated and suppressed positions have been actively moving and coming back to vent their frustration. As a result, the market has been unable to recover. What the future holds still depends on practical considerations.</p>
<h3>Continuous Supply; Tong Cotton Falls Again</h3>
<p>Local cotton trading has become quiet due to the sluggish yarn market and closed factory demand. At the same time, the supply of Tongzhou cotton and Changyinsha cotton continues to be continuous, so the selling price has declined. Tongzhou cotton has fallen by another small 3-4 yuan. Local traders, seeing the above situation, have also remained inactive and have not purchased, so the volume of transactions has been greatly reduced. The supply from northern Jiangsu includes 2,092 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 1,120 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 620 bales of northern sand cotton. The current spot cotton prices are listed below:</p>
<p>New Tong Cotton: $141.00 Traders: 700 bales</p>
<p>Brazilian: $175.00 Traders: 200 pieces</p>
<p>In other news, spot cotton trading in Shanghai has been quiet recently because of the firm exchange rate, so everyone is watching the purchase of foreign cotton. Yesterday, White Lock cotton was only sold for $163 due to the large influx of Tongzhou cotton.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was fairly firm and quiet in the morning. Trading in the Far East was also good. Later, the market weakened as the Southern Gang aggressively sold short and bulls took the opportunity to close out positions. As a result, closing prices were down 2-3 points from the previous day. The Indian cotton market has been fairly active lately due to slight inquiries from the Far East. Yesterday, the forecast was up 2 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 points. Liverpool was closed.</p>

<h3>Understanding Secondary Sexual Characteristics and the Onset of Puberty</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>When male and female children grow to a certain age, their testicles or ovaries begin to mature and discharge sperm or eggs. In females, this is the onset of menstruation, and in males, it is the occurrence of nocturnal emission. This period of maturation is called the onset of puberty. The timing of puberty varies depending on race, environment, etc. Saami people mature earlier, Europeans mature slightly later, tropical people mature earliest, and cold-region people mature latest. In terms of gender, the timing of puberty also differs, with females maturing earlier than males. On average, the onset of puberty for females is between 13 and 15 years old, and for males, it is between 14 and 16 years old. In females, ovulation ceases between the ages of 42 and 50, which is called menopause. Males, even at the advanced age of 60 or older, may still be able to ejaculate. This depends on the quality of hygiene during puberty. Some people experience a decline in their ejaculation function before middle age, which is due to promiscuity and masturbation during puberty, leading to premature sexual decline.</p>
<p>When males and females reach puberty, their genitals undergo significant changes. Genitals that have been dormant since birth begin to awaken, like dormant insects encountering the warm spring sun. The entire genital area becomes congested and increases in size. Males experience erections and nocturnal emissions, while females begin to menstruate. In fact, not only do the genitals change, but the entire body and mind of both sexes also undergo special changes. The general term for these changes is "secondary sexual characteristics." Human beauty and feminine beauty both originate from secondary sexual characteristics.</p>
<p>Puberty is also the most dangerous period in our lives, because young people are often driven by physiological impulses and experience heightened sexual desire, leading to various behaviors that harm the body and mind. If they engage in promiscuity and masturbation, their essence and blood will be depleted, leading to nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, weak brain, and kidney deficiency, which will erupt one by one. For the sake of health, they should take German testicular essence preparation for men called "Boti Kang" to replenish it, which functions to nourish blood and produce essence, strengthen the brain and fortify the kidneys. Long-term use can rejuvenate. Boti Kang is truly made by extracting testicular essence from young animals and mixing it with brain-nourishing phosphorus, so it has a great and comprehensive nourishing power. The female version has menstruation-regulating seeds, which can treat anemia and infertility.</p>
<p>Venereal Disease</p>
<h3>How Can Gonorrhea Be Conquered?</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>There are many treatments for gonorrhea, including injections, electrotherapy, and instruments, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, and none can be considered a complete treatment. Most doctors also pay attention to oral medications, because they are convenient to use. If they are effective, they will be a powerful tool for conquering gonorrhea. Other treatments often require a doctor to administer them, so their effectiveness is not widespread. However, oral medications with proven effectiveness are rare. Although there is a transdermal sterilization therapy recently, it only works on a local area and cannot be regarded as a radical cure. Recently, a leukocyte therapy has become very popular in medical circles in various countries, and its miraculous effects are astounding. According to its theory, it increases the number of leukocytes, which greatly increases the power to phagocytize bacteria and resist gonorrhea. As a result, gonorrhea bacteria, no matter where they are lurking or residing in the blood, are completely eliminated, and all stubborn gonorrhea cases are completely victorious and cured.</p>
<p>Based on this theory, Dr. Peter of Germany has mixed protein bodies and yellow pigments to create a medicine called "Kelinong." After taking it, it can boost leukocytes to enhance the power to resist gonorrhea and kill bacteria, thereby achieving a radical cure. All acute and chronic gonorrhea cases can achieve special effects after taking this medicine and be gradually eliminated. The success rate of treatment is consistently over 98%, so the medicine "Kelinong" is appreciated by doctors in various countries.</p>
<p>Since returning to the country after studying in the United States, I have paid close attention to the treatment of gonorrhea. Among the oral medications that have had special effects, only "Kelinong" is worthy of praise. In acute gonorrhea, it can have the effect of resisting gonorrhea, relieving pain, and promoting urination in a short period of time. In chronic gonorrhea, "Kelinong" can completely eliminate the gonorrhea bacteria hidden in the deep parts of the body. This is different from the general surface and local transdermal sterilization therapies, and it is also the most effective weapon to conquer gonorrhea.</p>
<h3>Conditions for Radically Curing Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Because health knowledge is not widely available in this country, many people contract lung disease as a result. Because this disease is extremely persistent, it has left a negative impression that lung disease is difficult to cure. In fact, this kind of wrong idea must be eliminated, so as not to be captured by the disease demon. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as the average doctor says, and on the contrary, lung disease can be cured in every case, as long as treatment and recuperation are done properly, there is nothing else mysterious about it. This is what I have learned from more than 20 years of experience. I always use the medicine "Bofei Naer" to nourish the lungs, relieve coughs, eliminate phlegm, and fill the cavities in the lungs. No matter how severe the bleeding is in the second or third stage of the disease, it can be absolutely cured by taking it. However, during the healing period, it is advisable to be quiet and not to exert oneself, and to consume more nourishing foods, which are the necessary conditions for the lung disease to be cured.</p>
<h3>Comparison of the Harms of Masturbation and Fantasy</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Masturbation is an unnatural action, which is to rub the external genitalia with the hands or other objects to achieve sexual pleasure and ejaculation. Fantasy is also an option, which is to consciously induce sexual imagination and illusory pleasure, in order to obtain ejaculation or sexual satisfaction. Masturbation can occur in children as young as eight or nine years old, while fantasy mostly occurs in adults, because children's imagination is not yet fully developed, so they cannot perform this unnatural mental self-abuse. In young people, the two can also occur together, such as fantasy first, followed by masturbation. The harms of the two can be said to be equal, or fantasy is worse, because fantasy is purely mental imagination, and if the mind is subjected to this unnatural stimulation for a long time, it is very easy to develop neurasthenia and other mental illnesses.</p>
<p>Whether it is self-abuse or fantasy, if it is done to excess, it will cause brain drain, mental exhaustion, poor development, and even atrophy of reproductive function, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and infertility. If this happens, health will be lost and life will be at risk. In order to remedy this, young people's masturbation and fantasy should be stopped immediately. Those who have nocturnal emissions should stop them quickly. The most effective medicine is to take German nocturnal emission medicine "Nairisi Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and nourish the brain, so that sleep is comfortable and nocturnal emissions can be avoided. At the same time, take German testicular essence preparation for men "Boti Kang" to replenish losses and promote development. Both medicines taken together will be effective quickly.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Forum</p>
<h3>Eradicating Stubborn Gonorrhea Bacteria</h3>
<p>— Written by Physician Yao Ju Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road, No. 9</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a very stubborn and difficult to cure venereal disease. It is easy to contract and difficult to cure, so it is widely spread. The reason why it is difficult to cure is mostly because the patient and the doctor cannot understand the condition and blindly suspect that their own disease has been cured. To be sure that the discharge is clear is a decision that will cause problems. It turns out that the gonorrhea bacteria are so small that they cannot be detected with the naked eye. Generally, once the acute stage of gonorrhea has passed, the secretion will decrease, but this should not be regarded as a sign that the gonorrhea is gradually healing. In fact, this is a kind of transformation of gonorrhea? That is, when people are negligent, the gonorrhea bacteria lie dormant and wait for an opportunity to move. Whenever the patient exerts himself, or engages in sexual activity, the urine will become cloudy again, and the gonorrhea will drip like floating catkins again. The changes in the disease are unpredictable, so chronic prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, and orchitis. Cystitis, etc., are all due to the patient and doctor's mistreatment and delay. Now, if you want to fundamentally eliminate this gonorrhea bacteria, you must thoroughly treat it and not be successful. You must implement a policy of eradicating the poison completely. If you still use palliative treatment of treating it as it comes and going or local surgery, there is absolutely no hope of a radical cure. For the past 20 years, I have tried all kinds of medicines and methods for the treatment of gonorrhea, and the fundamental solution for gonorrhea, once and for all, is to implement German static electricity therapy and take the gonorrhea sacred medicine "Kelinong". Because "Kelinong" can resist and kill gonorrhea bacteria in the deep parts, and static electricity therapy has the great effect of making "Kelinong" quickly exert its bactericidal effect and thoroughly eradicating gonorrhea bacteria in the superficial mucosa and other places. Once cured, there will never be a recurrence. Consultation hours: 10 am to 6 pm every day, sending out 20 numbers per consultation, each number costs only 5 dimes and includes a copy of the "Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" worth one yuan.</p>
<h3>Telegram Congratulating Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on Victory; Shanghai Celebrates National Day; Cold Weather Clothing Donation Exceeds 100,000 Yuan; Concession Authorities Implement Temporary Security Measures</h3>
<p>City Adorned with Flags, Hearts Uplifted</p>
<p>Today is the National Day of the Republic of China. The entire city is closed for the holiday, celebrating with fervor. Donations for cold weather clothing are pouring in from all sectors. Various organizations are sending telegrams to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express respect and offer comfort. The concession authorities are implementing temporary security measures. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hanging Flags and Taking Holiday, Expressing Celebration Together</p>
<p>All sectors of the city are celebrating National Day today. In these extraordinary times, following orders, no extravagant celebrations are being held. Instead, flags are displayed throughout the city for one day. Government agencies, organizations, schools, banks, money exchanges, major companies, and businesses are taking a holiday as usual to express their celebration together. The citizens of the city are particularly excited this National Day, coinciding with the great victory in Northern Hunan, which marks a turning point towards victory in the war. Therefore, their hearts are uplifted and their spirits are high, and their belief in the ultimate victory of the war of resistance and the inevitable success of nation-building is further strengthened.</p>
<p>Cold Weather Clothing Donation Reaches 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The National Cold Weather Clothing Donation Campaign Committee has set a goal to collect three million items of cold weather clothing this Double Tenth Festival. In Shanghai, a Cold Weather Clothing Donation Committee has been established to raise 200,000 yuan in donations. In recent days, various industry groups and schools have been actively soliciting donations. In the wake of the exhilaration following the great victory in Northern Hunan, the citizens of Shanghai are enthusiastically donating cold weather clothing. It is reported that nearly 100,000 yuan has been raised as of yesterday. It is expected that donations will be even more enthusiastic today. Furthermore, many citizens are voluntarily submitting their cold weather clothing donations to designated national banks for collection. The various banks are working diligently. In addition, charitable organizations are expanding their disaster relief efforts and plan to send representatives to visit and comfort refugees in shelters today.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman, Offering Comfort and Respect</p>
<p>Various organizations in Shanghai sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday to offer comfort and express respect on the occasion of National Day and the great victory in Northern Hunan. The telegram read: "To Chairman Chiang, Military Affairs Commission, and all frontline soldiers: Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, for two years, thanks to your wise leadership and the courageous efforts of our soldiers, the Japanese have suffered severe setbacks, sinking deeper and becoming unable to extricate themselves. Good news has been frequently received in recent days. Another great victory has been announced in Northern Hunan. Upon hearing this news, we are deeply moved and inspired. We hope that you will continue to press on and fulfill your mission. The citizens of Shanghai are determined to uphold the wise teaching of 'do not be arrogant in victory, do not be discouraged in defeat', and with unwavering will, support the national policy and remain steadfast to the end. We send this telegram to express our respect. We humbly request your consideration."</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Implement Security Measures</p>
<p>The police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, considering that today is the National Day of the Republic of China and many businesses are taking a holiday to celebrate, resulting in crowded public places and bustling urban areas, fear that some may take advantage of the opportunity to cause disturbances. Therefore, after consultation, they have decided to implement security measures for one day. Along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, unnecessary roads and lanes will be blocked off, following past security procedures. Red security vehicles and armored cars will be dispatched to patrol the roads, inspecting vehicles and pedestrians, to ensure the safety of the concessions.</p>
<p>Special Letter of Comfort to City Boy Scouts</p>
<p>The 50th Shanghai Boy Scout Troop has been providing outstanding wartime service. On the occasion of National Day, the sponsoring organization of the troop sent a special letter of comfort. The letter stated: "We hereby inform you that members of the troop have been serving in the rear of the military for over two years, traversing mountains and rivers, enduring hardships. Many have died in the line of duty or suffered injuries. They have fulfilled the mission of youth and lived up to expectations. On this National Day, we remember all the members who have left their hometowns and are serving faithfully, and we deeply commend them. The troop should send letters to all members stationed outside to inform them so that they may be further inspired and strive for a bright future. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>Appeal to Compatriots from Relief Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Thrift and Disaster Relief Committee issued an appeal to compatriots today, stating: "Our committee initiated thrift and disaster relief efforts on the Double Tenth Festival last year. Thanks to the enthusiastic participation and tireless fundraising efforts of shop employees, factory workers, young students, and housewives, a total of 100,000 yuan was collected. The funds already submitted to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association have been sent in eighteen batches, totaling 85,000 yuan. Considering that previously, every two yuan provided one month's worth of food for a refugee, then 42,500 refugees were able to survive because of this. Even if we calculate based on the current rate of four yuan per refugee, there are still 21,000 refugees. By curtailing our own sensory pleasures and desires, we are providing for the food and clothing needs of our compatriots. This cultivates the virtues of frugality and expresses the compassion of our hearts. This is truly 'loving each other and benefiting each other'. Currently, over five hundred comrades are still contributing thrift funds every month, persevering and remaining consistent. This sentiment and this determination are admirable and praiseworthy. However, with the current rise in prices, relief is more urgent than ever. On this anniversary of our thrift and disaster relief efforts, coinciding with the National Day of the Republic of China, we dare to once again sincerely appeal to our compatriots: please use your enduring strength to complete this great undertaking. Those who have already been contributing monthly payments should continue to do so. Those who have agreed to contribute but have not yet done so, those who have contributed but have stopped, or those who support the cause but have not agreed to contribute, are all requested to assess their circumstances and make their contributions accordingly. The amount is not important; many grains of sand will form a pagoda, and regular monthly contributions will sustain us through the coming year. In this way, we can do our best to save ourselves and save others. There is no greater good. We respectfully ask for your consideration."</p>
<p>Japanese Apprehension, Feeling Threatened</p>
<p>The situation in the outskirts of Shanghai is quite tense. Japanese troops and puppet "police" have been ordered to strengthen their defenses. The reason is that the National Day of China is approaching, and the recent victory in the great battle of Northern Hunan has sent shockwaves throughout the occupied territories. Guerrilla forces in the suburbs have also responded, posing a significant threat to Japanese strongholds. Starting yesterday morning, Japanese troops and puppet "police" have been tightening their checks on civilians entering and exiting, and conducting house-to-house searches at any time. The populace is alarmed multiple times a day. In the western part of Shanghai, residents have been hearing machine gun fire for as long as an hour at a time, once or twice a day, for the past three days. Furthermore, the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai, fearing that the Chinese troops lurking in various locations may take the opportunity to attack on today's Double Tenth Festival, has dispatched over three hundred additional Japanese soldiers to Minhang in western Shanghai, a key transportation hub for Shanghai-Hangzhou waterways and land routes, to step up defenses. At 3:00 PM yesterday, three shallow-water naval vessels were sent to patrol the waters from Longhua Wharf to Minhang.</p>
<h3>Lottery for Redemption of Type C Bonds of the Unified Public Debt Held Yesterday Morning; Eight Bonds Redeemed for 2.8 Million Yuan; Payment to Begin on January 31st of Next Year</h3>
<p>The eighth lottery for the redemption of Type C bonds of the Unified Public Debt of the Republic of China, issued in 1936, was held at 9:00 AM yesterday.

<h3>Rebuilding the Moral Movement; Broadcasting and Speech</h3>
<p>Promoting Spiritual Morality, Creating Sound Personalities</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM last night, the Rebuilding the Moral Movement broadcasted on XMHD radio station on Museum Road. Speakers included Tang Minghe, Professor Hu Zuyin of Shanghai University, Ms. Wang Hengren, a student, Ge Jialiang, a student of Zhejiang University, and Zhou Qingsheng, among others. Mr. Tang began by stating that in April of this year, twenty-five universities from various European countries gathered in Switzerland. After the meeting, they issued a declaration stating that the world's problem lies in how to restore spiritual morality, and that the purpose of education must be to create sound personalities and cultivate moral leaders to be pioneers in creating a new world culture. Professor Hu of Shanghai University elaborated in detail on his personal thoughts on rebuilding morality, saying that professors must not only be responsible for promoting the intellectual development of students but also help students develop perfect personalities. He proposed three implementation methods, hoping that schools can actively promote them: (1) Professors should stay at school for one or two hours each day to have personal conversations with students; (2) Professors should try their best to solve various difficult problems in students' lives; (3) Implement a mentor system. Mr. Zhou, who used to work in rural North China, vehemently opposed religion and morality during his student days, believing that they were tools used by the wise to bind the foolish. Later, witnessing the injustice of society, he advocated for social reform, but what he believed in could not solve the problems of society. After witnessing the Rebuilding the Moral Movement, he suddenly realized that social reform cannot succeed unless it starts with the reform of individuals. His words serve as a guideline for those who advocate "social transformation." Ge of Zhejiang University and Ms. Wang of Shanghai University both said that the Rebuilding the Moral Movement can provide accurate answers to personal, social, and global issues and testified with their own changes after recognizing the Rebuilding the Moral Movement. They hope that all students in the city can participate in the Rebuilding the Moral Movement and accept the four standards of Christ's sincerity, purity, altruism, and universal love to fulfill the mission of "new people," "new country," and "new world."</p>

<p>Two Japanese People Broke into a Private Girls' School Yesterday; After Much Disturbance, Eight Constables from the Concession Were Finally Arrested</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, eight Japanese military police and more than ten puppet police officers suddenly arrived at Lane 637 and Lane 638 on Yidingpan Road in a truck. They immediately guarded the entrance of the lane, prohibiting people from entering and leaving, and conducted house-to-house searches. As a result, nothing was found. The reason for the search is unknown. Residents, not knowing the truth, were all frightened.</p>
<p>At 10:40 AM yesterday morning, two Japanese men in Western-style clothing, holding a bundle of documents, suddenly broke into the Shanghai Private Girls' Middle and Elementary School at the intersection of Rue Lafayette and Avenue Saussaye in the French Concession, entered the office, and tried to sell maps to the school. Since the faculty and staff were holding a faculty meeting upstairs, the school servants politely refused. The two Japanese men became aggressive and caused much disturbance. Seeing that they were unreasonable, the school telephoned the police station to report the incident. After a while, the police station sent one Western detective and two Chinese constables to persuade them to leave the school. The Japanese men remained firm and refused to listen to the advice, seemingly deliberately looking for trouble. The detectives and constables then took them to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Continued Printing of 500,000 Fen Coins; Contract Signed; Industry Associations Exchange Fen Coins; Accommodation for Amounts over 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank issued one-fen and five-fen coins, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stated that since their issuance, very few coins have been circulating in the market, making it still difficult to meet the needs of various sectors for small change. According to letters from the New Medicine Industry, Sauce and Pickles Industry, and Coal and Charcoal Industry Associations, the Central Bank's Shanghai branch has been instructed to accommodate industry associations holding over 100 yuan in legal tender who wish to exchange them directly, to facilitate circulation. Furthermore, according to information obtained yesterday by a reporter from the New Sound Society from the banking sector, the Central Bank, in order to meet the actual needs of the Shanghai market, has decided to entrust the American-owned Yong Ning Company with the continued printing of 500,000 yuan in fen coins. The head office has instructed the Hong Kong office to sign a printing contract with the Yong Ning Company in Hong Kong. Once printing is completed, they will be transported to Shanghai for distribution by the Shanghai branch.</p>

<h3>North of the Suzhou Creek; British Troops Strengthen Defenses; Customs Police Station Increases Number of Detectives and Patrols; Japanese Troops Strictly Check Passports, One Chinese Person Detained</h3>
<p>Today is National Day. The British troops on the British-Japanese defense line in District A north of the Suzhou Creek strengthened their defenses starting yesterday. The Customs Police Station also dispatched more police to step up patrols. The work is particularly tight. Plainclothes Japanese personnel are constantly moving about. At the two gaps in North Jiangxi Road, Japanese troops strictly checked Chinese passersby. Yesterday, one man was detained by Japanese troops for losing his passport. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>British Troops on District A Boundary Step Up Security</p>
<p>The British military authorities in Shanghai, considering that today is the Chinese National Day and fearing that lawless elements may take the opportunity to cause trouble, are determined to carry out security work in their defense zone to maintain order. In addition to issuing orders to the departments and subordinates in the various defense zones in Shanghai to pay attention to security, they also dispatched more than ten Scottish soldiers in military vehicles to the defense post at the Qianye Guild Hall on North Henan Road yesterday to strengthen defense forces. Late at night, they were deployed along the road to maintain security in the area.</p>
<p>Customs Police Station Intensifies Patrols</p>
<p>Although the British and Japanese defense zones in District A have changed, all police powers west of North Jiangxi Road still belong to the Haining Road Customs Police Station. Yesterday afternoon, the police station dispatched Chinese and Western patrol officers to patrol along the road. Patrol officers were stationed at every intersection and increased patrols at both ends of the North Jiangxi Road Bridge, as if the defense zone had not changed. The patrol work was particularly tight, indicating that the police station did not take the police powers in District A lightly.</p>
<p>One Chinese Detained</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Guang She went to District A for inspection yesterday afternoon. When he arrived near the gap in Haining Road, he saw a man and a woman coming from Hongkou who intended to walk out of the gap. The Japanese troops asked to inspect their passports. Because the man only had the passport cover and did not know when he lost the passport, he was very panicked. He pleaded with the Japanese troops, but to no avail, and was detained. After more than an hour, he had not been released. The outcome is unknown.</p>
<p>Three Household Surveys, Situation Tense</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in District A have been sending plainclothes Japanese soldiers to inspect pedestrians outside the barbed wire for days. Yesterday afternoon, they intensified their efforts, seemingly preparing for Chinese National Day. They also conducted the first, second, and third household surveys in the barbed wire area. The residents were annoyed and asked to move out. However, the Japanese troops did not approve the residents' request to leave. Therefore, those who had moved in but could not move out were only left to sigh helplessly. It is also reported that the defense situation in the Hongkou area has been very tense recently.</p>
<h3>Three British Gunboats Depart Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Scorpion Flagship Remains in Shanghai to Command</p>
<p>After the British government decided to withdraw five British gunboats from the Yangtze River in China, in addition to the Dragonfly and Grasshopper, which left Shanghai for Singapore on the 3rd of this month, the Ladybug, Aphid, and Cricket are scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8:00 AM today. Their destination is also Singapore. As for the Scorpion, as the flagship of Commander Hu Yuantai of the Yangtze River Fleet, it has been decided to temporarily dock in Shanghai to command the other ships.</p>
<h3>British and American Passenger Ships Arrive in Shanghai on Schedule</h3>
<p>British Company's Putton Arrives in Shanghai from London via Hong Kong</p>
<p>The American President Lines' President Cleveland, which is scheduled to arrive in the Far East from Los Angeles, was slightly delayed due to the scheduled departure time, so it cannot arrive in Shanghai today. It is now scheduled to arrive on the 15th and depart for Hong Kong and Manila on the 16th. The C&amp;I Line's liner Sassica (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai on the 7th and docked at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. The ship carried more than ten passengers from England to China, who originally took the British Company's Rampura to Shanghai. After the ship arrived at Kolkata, it returned to England and then transferred to the Sassica to Shanghai. The passengers and cargo to and from Shanghai have also been loaded and unloaded. It is scheduled to raise anchor today and head to Japan and then to Hong Kong and return to Kolkata. Also, the British Company's Eurasia Line's regular postal ship Putton has departed from England for China. It is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong today and arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong tomorrow. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th. The Nellore managed by the company, which travels to San Francisco, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Resumes Traffic; Express and Freight Trains Can Also Run Soon; Domestic Section Uses Customs Gold, Consistent with Vietnamese Currency Price</h3>
<p>The foundation of the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was washed away by floods on the 26th of last month, and traffic was suddenly interrupted. After active repairs by the railway bureau, slow trains have been reluctantly restored. However, passengers must get off the train and walk from Xujia Ferry to Chengjiang, and then change trains. The journey takes one day longer than usual (usually takes three days). Express and freight trains are still suspended, but will be restored soon. Also, regarding the ticket prices of the railway, because the currency system of the domestic section and the Vietnamese section of the railway is different (the domestic section uses Customs Gold as the unit, and the Vietnamese section uses Vietnamese currency as the unit), and each unit fluctuates from time to time, the ticket price also increases and decreases. According to the latest regulations of the railway bureau, each Customs Gold is equivalent to 2.8 Vietnamese currency (usually only equivalent to 2.4 Vietnamese currency), so the ticket price also increases accordingly. Recently, the exchange rate has skyrocketed, with each Vietnamese currency equivalent to more than 3.5 national currency. The cost of the ticket is even more unaffordable, which adds another burden to the general travelers going to the mainland via Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Fell Again Yesterday; Marketed Volume Reached 10,000 Shi; Market Situation Remains Pessimistic; But Transportation Rights Still Controlled by Japanese</h3>
<p>This year's rainfall is well-distributed. Rice producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, such as Wuxi, Changshu, Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Pinghu, have all reported bumper harvests, increasing by 20-30% compared to last year. After the early rice harvest in various places, due to the high prices in the Shanghai market, a large amount of rice has arrived in Shanghai from the mainland. Yesterday, 11 inland river ships arrived, totaling 2,730 shi, and 30 land transport vehicles, totaling 3,750 shi. The quantity has increased by 30-40% compared to last week. In addition to the 2,730 shi that arrived yesterday, there were also 5,384 bags, totaling 10,000 shi, which is the highest since autumn. Due to oversupply, prices continued to fall. Jiangbei Xian fell by 7 jiao, Luo Xian fell by 1 yuan, Yang Xian fell by 5 jiao, and Japonica rice fell by 1 yuan. Each grade has fallen by 10 yuan compared to the peak. However, the market situation remains pessimistic, so the number of transactions is only half of the goods that arrived. As for the group order for foreign rice, although the registration has reached more than 60,000 bags, Jiangbei Xian is only 18.5 yuan and the best Japonica rice is only 32 yuan. Based on the current foreign exchange rate, it is more expensive than Japonica rice. Ordering foreign rice is no longer necessary, so the decision has been temporarily postponed.</p>
<p>Japanese Still Manipulating Rice Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council conducts weekly surveys of rice stocks in various warehouses throughout the city. Due to the recent increase in arrivals and sluggish sales, foreign warehouse stocks have also increased. The grain stocks in various warehouses last week increased by 10,000 bags (shi) compared to the previous week. Taixing, Taizhou, Rugao, Jiangyan, and other places in Jiangbei previously had low rice prices, so rice merchants went to purchase them. However, after the continuous drop in prices, it is difficult to make a profit after shipping them to Shanghai, so rice merchants have gone to purchase Japonica rice nearby. Therefore, rice prices in the city should be able to fall close to the limit price in the near future, and there is no need to worry about the future of food. However, the 13 rice ships from the mainland that arrived in Shanghai the other day were detained by the Japanese on the west section of the Suzhou Creek. After various efforts, they were finally released. Therefore, the source of rice is determined by the Japanese at any time. What should be detained and what should be released has no fixed standard. The rice industry can only sigh helplessly.</p>
<p>Coal Workers Demand Exceeds Scope</p>
<p>The city's coal workers have requested that the bean and rice industry association deduct 1 fen of coal labor for rice shipped to Shanghai by the Changjiang Gang, and the matter has not been resolved. It is said that the bean and rice industry is divided into two gangs, North and South. The production areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, etc., are the Southern Gang, and the production areas of Kunshan, Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, etc., are the Northern Gang. The rice from these two production areas is loaded on civilian ships to Shanghai, hence the name "River Cargo." Before the War of Resistance, the coal workers' coal labor cost 24 wen per shi (equivalent to 8 li). Since the start of the War of Resistance, it has been difficult to transport River Cargo, so it has been changed to railway transportation. Therefore, it has been changed from loose containers to packaging, with each package weighing more than 1 shi and 2 dou. Since the number of jin and liang have been specified, there is no need for coal workers. However, those who work as coal workers in Shanghai are hired by merchants, but they only have food to eat and no wages. Now, due to the packaging, they are completely unemployed and cannot maintain their lives. In order to take care of the lives of these people, the association, in this extraordinary period, regardless of packaging or ship transport, as long as it is rice produced in the Northern and Southern Gangs, even if it is loaded onto ships via the Changjiang River and shipped to Shanghai, 1 fen of coal labor will be deducted for every 160 jin to provide relief, which is a considerable amount. Now, the coal workers do not understand the internal organization of the association and request that the rice shipped to Shanghai by the Changjiang Gang also be deducted 1 fen per shi, which the association does not have the power to do. This is not within the scope of the association. The so-called Changjiang Gang production areas are Wuhu, Nanjing, and other places in Jiangbei, which are loaded on Yangtze River steamships, weighed but not by shi, so there is no need for coal workers or coal labor. "This is purchased by merchants from Anhui, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Nanjing, and other gangs, which belongs to the miscellaneous grain industry association. The coal workers' request exceeds this scope, so we can only explain in detail and publicly announce it to the society."</p>
<h3>Indian Youths Give an Account of Their Travels</h3>
<p>Departing Shanghai for Hong Kong on a Scheduled Date, They Wish to Meet the People of Shanghai: Three Indian youths, traveling the globe by bicycle, passed through Shanghai. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, these Indian youths have issued a statement saying: Since we completed our studies in our homeland, we spent several years working hard at our respective careers. Except for one who worked as an insurance broker, the rest of us were electrical engineers. During our time of employment, we harbored a burning desire and jointly planned in advance to</p>
<p>Save some money</p>
<p>for the grand endeavor of traveling the world. After several years, we were fortunate enough to not be disappointed. We calculated the amount of our savings, which was sufficient to cover our expenses for two years of travel. As for the source of funds after those two years, we had to make up our minds to give speeches, submit articles, broadcast on the radio, or sell our writings in the places we passed through, to sustain our lives on the journey. However, contrary to our expectations, we had only passed through</p>
<p>Fourteen Months</p>
<p>of our journey and had not been in England for long when our two-year budget was exhausted. From then on, we had no choice but to continue our previous approach of struggling to survive. When we set off from Bombay on our bicycles in April 1933, the situation in our homeland was extremely dire. Although it was shrouded in recession, we were always determined to advance towards our aspirations, relying on our spirit. We were not worried about not finding food to eat abroad, nor were we afraid that people from all walks of life would not give us</p>
<p>Good Sympathy</p>
<p>The purpose of our journey is not just to take risks in such a simple way. At the same time, we want to promote our homeland's culture everywhere, so that the world can learn more about it. We always feel that travel easily increases international and personal goodwill. Therefore, every time we give a speech or broadcast somewhere, we resolutely</p>
<p>Explain in Detail</p>
<p>the doubts and misunderstandings that the audience has about India. At the same time, we will record in detail the different customs and cultures of the places we pass through, and prepare to report all our feelings to our compatriots in detail when we return to rebuild our country in the future. Since we left our homeland, we have traveled 40,000 miles and passed through countries such as Afghanistan, Persia, Turkey, the Balkan countries, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Belgium, England, Ireland, France, Spain, Switzerland, and from Egypt to</p>
<p>Southern Africa</p>
<p>and from there across the Atlantic Ocean to Brazil, Panama, Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, the United States, and Canada, and then across the Pacific Ocean to Japan. After arriving in Shanghai, we plan to go south to Hong Kong before heading to the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Java, Sumatra, Singapore, the Malay colonies, Siam, and Burma. We hope to be able to</p>
<p>Return to Our Homeland</p>
<p>in 1943. What we feel most disappointed about is that China is currently in a time of turmoil, and we do not have the opportunity to visit the interior. However, we are still hoping that the flames of war in China will soon be extinguished, and we hope to come back for a pilgrimage. As we said earlier, our journey is not just about taking risks in such a simple way. However, in the eight years of scaling mountains and sailing the seas, we have naturally encountered many dangers. For example, we got lost in the Afghan desert and were only rescued after three days. In the northern capital of Persia, we were staying in a place that</p>
<p>Was Collapsed by Accumulated Snow</p>
<p>in the early morning. We spent a lot of effort to dig a small path to escape. For example, in Turkish territory, we were suspected by the authorities of being spies and were detained for fifteen days before being released. In West Africa, we had a near-death experience for a full twenty-one months. We must have encountered at least twenty-one times the pursuit of wild animals, the dangers of rapids and thorny forests, and the attacks of intense heat and severe cold.</p>
<p>Now in Shanghai</p>
<p>we are staying for a while, and we also hope to have the opportunity to meet people from all walks of life. If any associations or other groups would like to hear about everything we have experienced on our journey, please come to the White Head Association at 29 Rue des Patrouilles, or call 86776, and you will be able to contact us. We plan to set off for Hong Kong on the 17th of this month. By the way,</p>
<h3>Woman Injured in Abortion, Old Woman Arrested, Further Investigation Awaits Woman's Recovery</h3>
<p>Yuan Xu, daughter of Xu Wang, an elderly woman from Jiangbei residing at No. 5, Lane 325, Wuding Road (30 years old), has been working as a female worker at a certain factory at No. 57, Rue de Reims. Around May of this year, she fell in love with a male worker from the same factory named Zheng Wan-shi. After several encounters, she became pregnant, already five months along.</p>
<p>A Conspicuous Abdomen</p>
<p>was unsightly. After discussion with her paramour Deng Wan-bao, on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month at 3:00 PM, they went together to the home of Tang Yu, a 70-year-old Nanchang woman at No. 14, Tangjia Lane, North Fujian Road, and agreed to have the fetus in her abdomen removed for a price of thirty yuan. Tang Yu is an experienced abortionist, equipped with rubber gloves and iodine and other items.</p>
<p>A Surgical Procedure</p>
<p>was used to open Yuan Xu's vagina, and the five-month-old fetus was removed after a while and discarded somewhere. Yuan Xu was allowed to rest in her home. On the afternoon of the 8th at 2:00 PM, Yuan Xu returned to the home of her mother, Xu Wang, on Wuding Road, and felt pain in her abdomen and could not urinate or defecate. She told her mother about the situation. Xu Wang immediately hired a car to take her daughter to Guangren Hospital for treatment. After</p>
<p>Medical Treatment</p>
<p>it was found that Yuan Xu had suffered severe injuries from the abortion and required surgery to save her life, otherwise she would be in great danger. The hospital then telephoned the Gordon Road Police Station, who dispatched detective Cui Jinchuan to No. 14, Tangjia Lane, North Fujian Road, and arrested the abortionist Tang Yu, along with a bottle of iodine and rubber gloves.</p>
<p>Taken to the Police Station</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan reported the case and stated that the defendant had committed a similar crime in 1932 and was sentenced to six months in prison with a three-year reprieve. He requested a postponement of the case until the victim Yuan Xu recovered, etc. When questioned, the old woman Tang Yu gave evasive answers and begged for leniency. Judge Huang Risheng ordered her to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Incident of Mistakenly Detaining a British Citizen, Apologies Three Times</h3>
<p>The English Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that Colonel Igarashi, advisor to the "Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau," and Lu Ying, director of the puppet bureau, visited Major General Simons of the British Army in Shanghai last Saturday and Sunday to express their regret for the police department's mistaken arrest of Reuters correspondent Walter, a British citizen. This was the third apology made by the puppet municipal police since Walter was arrested at his residence on Yuyuan Road. First, when Walter was released on Friday morning, the puppet bureau apologized to him. In the afternoon of the same day, Colonel Igarashi and Lu Ying formally apologized to British Consul Kitson. On the following day, the Japanese again apologized to Major General Simons.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cotton Exports Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that, according to the Japanese newspaper Continental New Report, after the outbreak of the European war, merchants in the Dutch East Indies and British India adopted a wait-and-see policy, resulting in a sharp decline in Japanese cotton exports in September.</p>
<h3>Cheap Labor, Abundant Raw Materials, China's Unlimited Future, Will Become a Major Exporting Country, No One Can Stop China's Export Development</h3>
<p>The English Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported, "China can supply unlimited cheap skilled labor and has abundant raw materials. We believe it will become one of the world's major exporting countries. Once the Chinese people realize the needs of this industrial era, there will be no force in the world that can stop China's export development. The time when the world can peacefully trade with China will surely come." The above words are the foreword to the new Shanghai quarterly "China Exporter." The first issue of the publication, which has just been published, contains statistics and special articles on the recent development of various Chinese export goods. The purpose of the publication is to report the situation of Chinese products to overseas purchasers and to outline the recent development of China's export trade.</p>
<h3>US Navy in Shanghai Holds Regular Drills to Commemorate the 164th Anniversary of the US Navy, One Guard Team Will Wear Various Military Uniforms</h3>
<p>The English Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that November 10th is the 164th anniversary of the founding of the United States Marine Corps. The 4th Marine Regiment of the US Navy in Shanghai will hold drills on that day, which will be reviewed by Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, and his staff officers. At that time, Admiral Hepburn will present a new regimental flag to the 4th Regiment. There will also be a Marine Corps guard team wearing specially made military uniforms of various styles, so that viewers can see the changes in the US Marine Corps uniforms since 1775. Although the date of the drills is still far away, the 4th Regiment has already formulated a plan, such as holding a dance party at the 4th Marine Corps Club on Jing'an Temple Road. American expatriates in this city will also participate in the commemoration on that day.</p>

<h3>Rampant Thugs in the "Badlands," Gambling Dens Have Poor Business, Puppet "Bureau of Opium Suppression" Levies Heavy Taxes, Business of Opium Dens Also Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>The English Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that, according to what a reporter learned from an inspection in western Shanghai on Saturday and Sunday nights, the evil atmosphere in the area has gradually declined and returned to dormancy due to the collapse of law and order. The "Badlands" have become "Deadlands." The thugs in the area include members of the so-called "Self-Defense Corps" affiliated with the "Great Way Police Bureau" and plainclothes soldiers of the "Pacification Army."</p>
<p>Rampant and Unscrupulous</p>
<p>They made the once prosperous "Badlands" gambling dens and their surroundings feel uneasy and terrorized, resulting in a sharp decline in the gambling business. Gamblers were indifferent to rumors of the "Great Way" side clearing the "Badlands" and the Public Concession Police Department tightening the curfew, but when they found armed thugs wandering around and carrying out robberies, they were afraid to go to the gambling dens. It is said that these thugs also go to the gambling dens to gamble. If they win, they leave safely. If they lose, they</p>
<p>Wait Outside</p>
<p>to rob gamblers who win money. The bodyguards hired by the gambling dens are powerless because they know that if they interfere, the thugs will greet them with bullets. As a result of the thugs' activities, the prosperous days of the "Badlands" are now over. The famous Hollywood Amusement Park is the largest gambling den in the area. On Saturday and Sunday nights, only one roulette table had thirty or forty gamblers around it. In another room, there were two Fan-Tan tables and</p>
<p>A Few Gamblers From Other Provinces</p>
<p>and several foreigners in each room. Apart from the depressed employees of the gambling dens, there were no gamblers at all. There were also very few opium smokers. The Shen Garden, which used to be a dog racing track and was later converted into a Chinese sports center, has recently become a gambling den. Although roulette equipment has been prepared, no one goes to gamble there. Apart from a "dice gambling table" with twenty gamblers around it, all other places were silent, like the Jiujiang Road during the New Year. The taverns, where</p>
<p>Nude Performances</p>
<p>used to attract hundreds of customers, had very poor business that night. Other nightlife spots in the "Badlands" also had very few customers. The non-gambling venues along Yuyuan Road suffered even more due to the lack of law and order in the area and the fact that American sailors and Marines were not allowed to go there, resulting in particularly poor business. Although the situation in the "Badlands" is like this, it is said that nightlife spots in the Public Concession and the French Concession are thriving. The gambling dens in the "Badlands" are</p>
<p>Quite Shocked</p>
<p>by this development and are seriously considering ways to attract gamblers, one of which is to provide a variety of entertainment performances, such as performances that cannot be staged in the two concessions. The opium business in the "Badlands" is also affected by the lack of law and order. In addition to being harassed by armed thugs, opium dens are also suffering from heavy taxes levied by the "Reformed Government's Opium Suppression Bureau." The bureau's office is located at 52 Kangfu Lane, Route Bricol, and it charges every ounce of opium brought into the "Badlands"</p>
<p>A Fee of One Dime</p>
<p>The bureau also stipulates the opium sales quota for each opium den. If the opium sales are less than the previous month, the opium den owner will be held responsible for the decline in the bureau's income and will be heavily fined.</p>
<h3>Son Lost for More Than a Year, Father and Son Reunited, Child Sent to Court After Disappearance, Adopted by a Bailiff Who is Now Recognized as Foster Father</h3>
<p>Yan Dajue, a Cantonese lawyer residing at No. 131, Museum Road, had a son named Zhong Biao, who was only seven years old. He suddenly disappeared in August of last year. The French police took him in, but because no one claimed him for a long time, they sent the child to court. At that time, Chen Xinghe, bailiff No. 559 of the court, requested</p>
<p>To Adopt Him</p>
<p>and take him as his adopted son. The court approved it. Yan had been searching for his beloved son since he disappeared, and he had reported it to the Public Concession police, who searched everywhere without success. It wasn't until the 8th of this month that Chen took Zhong Biao to the Daxin Company amusement park, where they were suddenly spotted. He then went forward to negotiate, and Chen explained the circumstances of the adoption. Yesterday, both parties went to the Second Special District Court to request</p>
<p>A Solution</p>
<p>Judge Qiu summoned them for questioning. According to Yan's statement, since his son disappeared, Chen Xinghe had taken him in, and now he was claiming the child to reunite the family. Chen did not object, and he was extremely grateful and intended to recognize Chen as his foster father to repay the kindness of adoption. The court examined the statements and ruled that Yan Zhong Biao be allowed to be taken home by his father Yan Dajue.</p>
<h3>Chen Liangyu Passes Away</h3>
<p>Memorial Service to be Held Today at Qingliang Temple</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Liangyu of Zhenhai was honest and kind by nature and proficient in political science and law. He successively served as a judge of the Shanghai South General Engineering Bureau, a director of the County Chamber of Commerce, an arbitrator of the General Chamber of Commerce, a member of the National Goods Promotion Committee, and a member of the Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to public welfare affairs, such as the Ningbo Fellow Association, the Siming Guild Hall, the Famine Relief Association of various provinces, the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association, the Renji Shantang, and the Pushan Villa, tirelessly serving in all of them. The Pushan Villa had no funds for burial expenses, but thanks to Mr. Chen's efforts, it has achieved what it is today. After the August 13th Incident, he was enthusiastic about burial work and refugee relief. However, he fell ill due to overwork and suddenly passed away on August 23rd, at the age of seventy-three. He is survived by three sons, fifteen grandchildren (male and female), and five great-grandchildren (male and female). In his dying words, he instructed his sons to allocate the condolence money to the Pushan Villa and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. His benevolence and righteousness are truly admirable. A memorial service will be held today at Qingliang Temple on Niuzhuang Road, and one imagines that the plain carriage and white horse will surely bring a scene of mourning and honor.</p>
<h3>Wu Meiqing, Respected Elder of Wuxing in Shanghai, Mourned</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Meiqing, a respected elder of Wuxing, was usually enthusiastic about public welfare and benefited his hometown. Fellow villagers of Lake County deeply loved and respected him. He passed away in Shanghai on June 20th of this year. Yesterday (October 8th), a post-issuing ceremony was held at the Lake Society. More than 200 guests, including Yuan Ludeng and Shen Tianxin, attended. The Lake Society Committee held a public memorial service, presided over by Mr. Yan Junyi. For a time, there was extreme mourning and honor.</p>
<h3>Dancer Concludes She is Pregnant, Accuses a Customer of Abandonment, Cannot Determine Who Impregnated Her, Girl Sent to Forensic Doctor for Examination Before Further Hearing</h3>
<p>Cao Zheng, a young clerk (also known as Cao Zhen, 19 years old, from Nanxiang) at Cao Xiangtai Silk and Cotton Store, No. 276 Rue du Consulat, privately arranged a marriage agreement with Qian Xiuying (also known as Huizhen, 17 years old), a dancer at the Da Mei Dance Hall, No. 66 Kuei An Li, Rue Gloc. A physical relationship ensued.</p>
<p>Girl Became Pregnant</p>
<p>Due to her inability to dance, she stopped working and stayed at home, waiting for Cao to send a matchmaker to discuss the marriage. However, Cao Xing Yin avoided her. The girl's parents negotiated the marriage with the man's family. Cao's parents opposed the marriage because the girl was a dancer, which would affect their reputation. Therefore, the girl's father, Qian Shaoqing, as her legal representative, hired a lawyer to sue Cao Zheng in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for seduction and abandonment, disrupting family ethics and morals. After an initial court hearing, Cao Zheng</p>
<p>admitted in court that he could not fulfill his wishes due to his parents' opposition. The court ordered a postponement and ordered the defendant to post bail pending further questioning of the girl's father. This case was re-examined yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM by Judge Zhang Minsheng. Both parties and their lawyers were present in court. First, the plaintiff Qian Xiuying's father, Qian Shaoqing, acting as legal representative, testified. He was 58 years old, from Changshu, and worked as a tailor. He used to live in Hongkou but moved to Kuei An Li during the January 28th Incident. His daughter, Xiuying, started dancing in May of last year, first learning at the Xiaoyao Dance Hall. At this point, the court said to the plaintiff's lawyer, Zhou Yingjie, "Your petition states that Qian Shaoqing is Qian Xiuying's mother, 41 years old this year. Why is the testimony today</p>
<p>Inconsistent?</p>
<p>The lawyer replied, "The plaintiff and her mother always came together to commission the firm, and they did not specify her father. The petition was drafted based on what they said." The court immediately ordered the petition to be corrected in court. Then, Qian Xiuying was questioned about the circumstances of her relationship with Cao Zheng. Qian's testimony was the same as before. Cao admitted that he had a relationship with Qian and had lived in the plaintiff's house. He claimed that the girl had many dance partners, and he could not determine if he was the one who caused the pregnancy. At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Wang Hengyuan, offered</p>
<p>A Letter</p>
<p>stating that Hong Da Kui, who lived at No. 34 Yüqing Li, Chengdu, sent a letter to the defendant's father, Cao Yongxiang, stating that the plaintiff Qian Xiuying was his lover and they had a marriage agreement. He accused the defendant of stealing his love and threatened to retaliate if they married. He presented the letter for review. After reviewing it, the court ordered a postponement to the 18th for further questioning. The defendant remained on bail, and the plaintiff Qian Xiuying was ordered to be sent to a forensic doctor for examination pending verification.</p>

<h3>Small Boat of Puppet "Fish Market" Carelessly Loses Control at Wusong Estuary, Dozens of Passengers Burned, Cargo Ship Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, a small steamship, Yong An, hired by the puppet "Fish Market", loaded with fish and passengers from Chongming to Shanghai, unexpectedly, when it sailed to the outside of Wusong Estuary, for some reason, three large boxes of gasoline installed inside the ship suddenly exploded, and the entire cabin was filled with fire in a flash. Passengers saw the situation and scrambled in chaos, with cries and screams echoing. Because rescue was impossible at that time, the fire could only be allowed to spread, resulting in all forty or fifty male and female passengers being burned, with no one spared. Another barge happened to see it and provided assistance, and then transported dozens of injured people to Shanghai and sent them directly to the Shanghai East Hospital for treatment. It is reported that among them, two fishmongers, Chen Lingeng and Zhang Ade, both from Chongming, were the most seriously injured, their skin and flesh completely stripped off, and their lives were in danger. The ship was completely burned and turned into an iron shell.</p>

<h3>The New China Grows in Struggle</h3>
<p>— De Yin</p>
<p>China Has Now Awakened</p>
<p>Today's China is suffering unprecedented hardship. However, with few exceptions, every Chinese person is increasingly confident in their nation. Everyone feels that any significant, necessary price is worth paying to strive for national independence and freedom. Moreover, facts prove that the awakened New China, despite the extreme devastation of the invaders, is ultimately thriving and growing.</p>
<p>Driven by the Xinhai Revolution</p>
<p>This phenomenon of national awakening began with the Xinhai Revolution. The success of the Xinhai Revolution indicated that China, which occupies an important position in the world, is by no means an unpromising, nearly declining country. It can no longer tolerate the bullying of imperialism and seeks development independently and freely. Although the imperialist powers were jealous of the expansion of China's revolutionary forces, they were forced by circumstances to recognize the republican government at that time. The twenty-eight years of history since the establishment of the Republic of China, on the one hand, reflect the power struggles of the powers in China, and on the other hand, represent the continuation of the Chinese national revolutionary forces' struggle against imperialism.</p>
<p>Among the imperialist powers, it goes without saying that Japanese imperialism is the most oppressive to China. The most heartbreaking national humiliations in modern Chinese history were all bestowed by Japanese imperialism. Historical fate dictates that Japanese imperialism, due to its backwardness during the period of its rise and due to the limitations of its geographical situation, must adopt the goal of conquering China. For this reason, China's revolution cannot be separated from the struggle against Japan, and the main task of the Chinese revolution is to destroy Japanese imperialism. The beginning of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary movement, namely the establishment of the Zhonghe Society, coincided with the year before the Sino-Japanese War, which cannot be said to be entirely accidental.</p>
<p>Great Potential Power</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism's idea of invading China was decided as early as the time of the annexation of Japan and Korea. The famous Tanaka Memorial clearly stipulates that Japan should adopt a continental policy, starting with Manchuria and Mongolia, and then use military threats to subdue the people of all China through "domination." In other words, it is to destroy China. However, the 450 million Chinese people have great potential power. Thanks to the constant efforts and appeals of revolutionary pioneers, the Chinese people are awakening and uniting day by day. Seven years ago, Japan seized the four northeastern provinces by force, but contrary to the expectations of the Japanese militarists, the Chinese people not only did not become "dominated" because of this, but instead became more and more determined in their will to resist. The cannon fire at Lugou Bridge finally became the clarion call for the nationwide war of resistance. Japanese imperialism had to fall into the quagmire of war.</p>
<p>Superior Weapons Have Lost Their Effectiveness</p>
<p>During the two-year war, Japanese imperialism, relying on its superior weapons, did occupy many cities along the transportation arteries of China. However, it could not do anything to control areas slightly away from the transportation arteries, no matter how hard it tried. At the same time, Japan's domestic economy is becoming increasingly exhausted due to the protracted war. After the recent defeat in northern Hunan, Japanese soldiers have certainly become more and more lacking in confidence in their ability to continue their offensive.</p>
<p>China Has Taken the Initiative</p>
<p>As for China, in the military aspect, the Chinese army has gradually gained the advantage of taking the initiative in the counteroffensive; in the political aspect, the whole country is working together to support the war of resistance; in the economic aspect, the Chinese government's international credit is becoming increasingly consolidated, and the construction of the rear is also making progress day by day. All of this is sufficient to prove that China's resistance is becoming stronger day by day with the progress of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>The goal of independence and freedom is gradually approaching for China, no matter what. However, as the ancients said, "He who walks a hundred li is halfway at ninety." The struggle in the coming days will still be extremely difficult. Every Chinese person must stand on their own position and work twice as hard.</p>
<h3>Recollections of the Xinhai Revolution</h3>
<p>— Wang Boxiang</p>
<p>1. The Prelude to the Revolution: In the late years of the Qing Dynasty, foreign aggression was imminent, and the administration was corrupt. Patriotic people all wanted to strengthen themselves. They were divided into two major factions due to different views: one faction advocated "constitutionalism to save the country," and the other faction advocated "national revolution." The Qing court, forced by the situation, had to agree to constitutionalism and oppose revolution, but the result was that "false constitutionalism" led to a "true revolution."</p>
<p>The revolutionary party's uprising began with the Guangzhou Uprising in the twenty-second year of Guangxu (1896). The person in charge of this was President Sun. Afterwards, the revolutionary party repeatedly failed in the Huizhou, Zhennanguan, Hekou, and Guangzhou Second Revolution, but their courage did not wane. Finally, they took advantage of the trend of the state recovering the Sichuan-Han Railway and launched the first uprising in Wuchang.</p>
<p>2. The Wuchang Uprising and the Response of the Provinces</p>
<p>On the nineteenth day of the eighth lunar month in the Xinhai year (i.e., October 10, 1911), the revolutionaries of the left team of the eighth battalion of the Wuchang Engineering Camp took the lead in launching an uprising. The next morning, they divided their troops and went to Hanyang and Hankou, and elected Li Yuanhong, the commanding officer of the 21st Mixed Brigade of the Army, as the "Military Governor of the Military Government of the Republic of China." With this call, all parties responded quickly. In just a few months, the provinces successively announced their recovery.</p>
<p>3. The Fall of Hanyang and the Capture of Nanjing</p>
<p>After the Wuchang Uprising, the Qing court immediately sent naval and land forces to attack. On the 27th, the two sides began fighting, and the Qing army was defeated and retreated north along the railway line. When the news was received that Yuan Shikai was about to go south to supervise the army, the situation changed, because the southern survivors of the Qing army were all old subordinates of Yuan. When they heard that their old commander was returning, their courage naturally rose sharply. On the sixth day of the ninth lunar month, they fought with the civilian army again, and with the help of warships, they attacked into Dazhimen in Hankou, started looting, and then set it on fire. At that time, the civilian army retreated to Hanyang. On the 26th day of the ninth lunar month, they began to cross the Han River and shelled the Qing army, advancing and retreating. On the 28th, all the naval vessels revolted and fired to assist in the battle, and the Qing army's momentum was greatly thwarted. It just so happened that Yuan Shikai formed a new cabinet in Beijing and strictly ordered the Qing army to advance on Hanyang, turning from defense to offense. On the third, fourth, and fifth days of the ninth lunar month, there were bloody battles for several consecutive days. On the afternoon of the seventh day, Hanyang was regained by the Qing army, and they were able to use the giant cannons of Turtle Mountain to bombard Wuchang across the river at any time. The entire city of Wuchang fell into the fire line, and the situation was critical. Fortunately, the civilian army defended the city firmly. In just four or five days, Nanjing, the fundamental stronghold in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, was captured by the civilian army. As a result, the foundation of the civilian army became more consolidated. After the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu successively recovered, the civilian army in China had reached the point where it "occupied two-thirds of the world."</p>
<p>4. The Establishment of the Provisional Government</p>
<p>The Hubei Governor's Office realized that the recovered provinces were each governing themselves, and there was no joint organization to carry out the work, which was very inconvenient. Therefore, it summoned representatives from various provinces to Wuhan for a meeting, using the Shunchang Foreign Firm in the British Concession in Hankou as the meeting place. The first meeting was held on the tenth day of the tenth lunar month, and on the thirteenth day, the outline of the organization of the provisional government was resolved and announced on the same day. On the fourteenth day, the news of the capture of Nanjing was heard, and it was decided that Nanjing would be the location of the provisional government. From the 21st to the 23rd, representatives from various provinces gathered in Nanjing, and on the tenth day of the eleventh lunar month, a meeting was held to elect the Provisional President. Representatives from seventeen provinces attended the meeting, totaling seventeen votes. President Sun received sixteen votes alone and was elected as the Provisional President of the Republic of China. President Sun took office in Nanjing on the thirteenth day of the eleventh lunar month. That day happened to be January 1 of the solar calendar. Since the provisional government decided to adopt the solar calendar, the day President Sun took office was designated as New Year's Day of the first year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Historical Fragments</p>
<h3>Important Party and State Figures in the Era of the Xinhai Revolution</h3>
<p>Although the Xinhai Revolution is now twenty-eight years old, most of the military and political leaders currently in the War of Resistance are still the figures who devoted themselves to the national revolution at that time. As the Double Ten National Day anniversary approaches, we will flip through the history of the past and extract the glorious history of the military and political leaders who are currently holding important positions in the party and state at that time twenty-eight years ago, which I think will also be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin: After the Xinhai Revolution, when the provisional government was established, Mr. Lin was elected as the speaker of the Senate.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang: When the Wuchang Uprising broke out, Mr. Chiang happened to be in Japan, serving as a candidate officer, attached to the 17th Cavalry Regiment in Takada. At that time, he was already a member of the Tongmenghui. After hearing the news of the revolution, he returned to Shanghai with his comrades and plunged into the revolutionary upsurge, founding the Xiejihui, and was responsible for planning military expenses. He also served as the commander of the 5th Regiment of the Shanghai Army, leading troops to fight in various parts of Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang: During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Feng was serving as the Battalion Commander of the Third Battalion of the Eightieth Regiment of the Qing Army, under the jurisdiction of Chen Huan, the commander of the 20th Town, stationed in Tanghe on the Beijing-Fengtian Railway. After the Wuchang Uprising, he secretly plotted to respond to the independent civilian army, but failed to achieve his goal.</p>
<p>Yu Youren: During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Yu was still a journalist, running the Minli Daily and the Shenzhou Daily, propagating the revolution very vigorously. In January of the first year of the Republic of China, when the Nanjing Provisional Government was established, he was appointed as the Deputy Minister of Transportation.</p>
<p>Li Liejun: During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Li conspired with Cai E and Tang Jiyao to make Yunnan independent. Later, he returned to his home province of Jiangxi and served as the head of the Jiangxi branch of the Tongmenghui, running around for the Jiangxi independence movement, leading the Northern Expedition Army of Jiangxi, and serving as the commander of the Hubei Relief Army.</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui: During the Xinhai Revolution, he represented Guangdong and attended the Nanjing Conference, serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Nanjing Provisional Government.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting: After the Xinhai Revolution, he traveled around for the North-South peace talks and served as the Director of Foreign Affairs of the Hubei Military Government.</p>
<p>Yan Xishan: During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Yan was the commander of the 43rd Association of the Shanxi New Army, stationed in Shanxi. He and his comrades launched an uprising in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, in response to the revolution. He also killed Lu Zhongqi, the governor of Shanxi at that time, and was elected as the Governor of Shanxi, announcing the independence of Shanxi. At the same time, he sent troops to Niangziguan to prevent the Qing army from invading Shanxi.</p>
<p>Ma Junwu: During the Xinhai Revolution, he was a representative of Guangxi and went to Nanjing, devoting himself to the organization of the provisional government.</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei: During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Cai returned to Shanghai from Japan and participated in the hub of the civilian army. After the establishment of the Nanjing Provisional Government, he was elected as an advisor.</p>
<p>Sun Ke: During the Xinhai Revolution, President Sun was in Europe, while Mr. Sun Zhesheng was in San Francisco, USA. In the United States, he once made a declaration stating that after China established a republic, the right to vote should be determined according to the level of education, and women should also be given the right to vote.</p>
<p>Shen Junru: Mr. Shen, known as one of the Seven Gentlemen, served as the Commissioner of Foreign Affairs of the Zhejiang Military Government during the Xinhai Revolution.</p>
<h3>Female Revolutionary Soldiers During the Xinhai Revolution</h3>
<p>— Huan</p>
<p>In the history of the Xinhai Revolution, there is no shortage of female heroes, and Ms. Qiu Jin is the most famous. Secondly, Ms. Xue Suzhen in Shanghai once led students from Shangxia Women's School to organize the Women's National Army and submitted it to Governor Chen Qimei for approval. Her submission stated: "Since ancient times, women have formed armies and palace women have taught formations; Mulan replaced her father and Liangyu assisted her husband. History has passed on beautiful stories, and future generations should not allow them to be surpassed. Recently, with the sound of Chu songs, righteous flags have been raised in all directions. Shanghai is a major commercial port, and the governor is born in response to the times; merchants and people have formed dare-to-die corps, and the academic community has started pioneer teams. The rise and fall of a country is the responsibility of every woman. Now, the Women's National Army is initiated, and everything will be done in accordance with the methods of the male national army and people. Detailed rules will be submitted for approval. At the impact of the 20th century trend, the stage is divided by men and women; to revitalize the 5,000-year-old weakness of literature, the national soul is recruited together with the weavers." A few days later, she led female student representatives to the Governor's Office to request an audience. Governor Chen was busy with military affairs and appointed a receptionist to inquire about everything. That evening at 9:00 p.m., he approved the organization. The approval stated: "Reading the brief regulations, I can see that women's patriotism is no less than that of men. If all women in the world are like you, why worry about not soaring in the world? Now that you have abandoned rouge and powder and engaged in black iron, the courage of the enemy will be lost in the face of the women's army..." Now that the country is in turmoil and the soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles, all my patriotic female compatriots, upon reading this, should not allow Qiu Xue to monopolize the beauty of the past. Mr. Sun Yat-sen in his youth.</p>

<h3>National Day Talks About the Hongmen Society</h3>
<p>— Sang Yu</p>
<p>Continue to Tread on the Bloodstains of the Martyrs and Create a Glorious History of the Future</p>
<p>From the founding history of the Republic of China, we can find many examples of the pioneers who created the Republic of China fighting together with the old secret societies. The most important things are the relationship between the Xingzhonghui and the Gelaohui. These two societies once merged, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen served as the chairman. (Twelve years before the founding of the Republic of China) The United States Zhigongtang held a general meeting in San Francisco eight years before the founding of the Republic of China to welcome President Sun and respectfully called him "Brother Sun." The Huanghuagang Uprising was the most powerful revolutionary movement to create the Republic of China. Half of the funds for this movement came from the Zhigongtang members in Canada. At that time, because the expenses were temporarily increased, the members could not raise enough money and even sold public and private property to donate to the revolution. These three events are the most famous events in which Hongmen Society members participated in the revolution. In addition, Huang Xing, Qiu Jin, Chen Shaobai, etc. are founding fathers in the history of the Chinese revolution, and they are also very famous "leaders" and "fans" of the Three Dots Society. In fact, if we flip through the founding history of the Republic of China for more than 30 years before and after, almost every one of the 200 or so uprisings, large and small, had secret society members participating, and they were very powerful fighters in each one. At that time, although there were many names for secret societies, such as the Three Dots Society and the Gelaohui, the general name was the Hongmen Society Party.</p>
<p>Are all the members of the Hongmen Society Party revolutionaries? Did all the Hongmen Society members who participated in the revolution do so to create the Republic of China? That may not be the case. Here are two excerpts from history:</p>
<p>"...Li Yunbiao and others thought that the Xingzhonghui, etc. did not provide enough, and did not satisfy their desires. It happened that Kang Youwei came to Hong Kong from Nanyang, wanting to use him, and gave Li and others 100 taels of gold each. Li and others thought that Kang was rich, so they developed a relationship with him. Bi Yongnian (Mr. Bi was a friend of Sun Yat-sen, Tang Caichang, and others) blamed them for righteousness, but it was ineffective, so he resentfully thought of being tired of the world and threw himself into Putuo and shaved his hair to become a monk. Li and others later helped Tang Caichang run the Hankou Uprising, but soon they also announced their split because they could not get funding..." (Page 159 of the History of the Founding of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>From this historical fact, we can find that there were also traitors in the Hongmen Society who were greedy for money, sold friends, and even forgot righteousness. At least this Mr. Li was like this. However, the Xinhai Revolution was ultimately launched due to the sympathy and assistance of the heroic Hongmen Society members, and it was also due to this that the Republic of China was created for the hundreds of millions of Chinese people. The ugly acts of a few traitors are just like a little dark cloud floating over the bright moonlight. Although there are a few seconds of darkness for the people on Earth, it will never have a major effect.</p>
<p>Now, the Republic of China is encountering a great era again. All the people of the country should devote themselves to this great era and fight for the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation. We sincerely pray that all the secret society members in the country will advance bravely along the glorious historical traces of the martyrs such as Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing, Chen Shaobai, Bi Yongnian, and Qiu Jin, and never repeat the mistakes of Li Yunbiao.</p>

<p>Revolutionary History Talk</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Anniversary of the Chinese Revolution: The History of the French Revolution</h3>
<p>— Fang Qi</p>
<p>Suffering is Enough to Revitalize the Country: We Can Learn from It</p>
<p>Many of the National Day celebrations in the past twenty-eight years have been spent in suffering. But any country is bound to have suffering. This makes us think about how many other countries have spent National Day in suffering.</p>
<p>This year is the 150th anniversary of the French Revolution. Let's try to examine this anniversary, which has a very long history. I don't have enough reference materials on hand—and I'm afraid there may not even be such ready-made materials—so I can't say for sure what the situation was on a certain anniversary. I can only briefly mention the general situation at that time. But what is most relevant is precisely the general situation, right?</p>
<p>Although the anniversary of the republic is now 150 years ago, France has spent only 85 years under republican politics. Breaking through the Bastille prison was in 1789, but the French king was not immediately overthrown. The First Republic was not established until 1792, and it lasted only 12 years, counting until Napoleon became emperor. The First Empire and the restored dynasty ruled for 44 years. In 1848, the Second Republic appeared again, but it maintained the name of a republic without actual democracy for four years. Louis Napoleon followed his uncle's old tricks and went from being the ruler to becoming the emperor, until he was captured in the Battle of Sedan in 1870. The Third Republic was established in 1871 and has lasted 69 years to this day.</p>
<p>The scope does not allow me to narrate year by year since 1789. Selecting only the years with major events may inevitably have selection bias, so I will try to observe each decade anniversary.</p>
<p>1799. This year, the country was still under the rule of the political group of the Republic, but it was on the verge of collapse due to its corruption. Napoleon was waging a war that he did not recognize as a failure in the Near East. The country was being threatened by a new alliance of three countries. Napoleon, who returned home in embarrassment, smoothly seized power the following year.</p>
<p>1809. The tenth year after Napoleon came to power, the sixth year after he became emperor. He had just won the Battle of Wagram against Austria and married an Austrian princess by force.</p>
<p>1819. The monarch of the Bourbon dynasty was carrying out a reactionary rule because the prince was assassinated.</p>
<p>1829. Charles X's rule was extremely reactionary. The people were extremely uneasy, and the crisis of the July Revolution the following year had matured.</p>
<p>1839. It was the middle of the period from the July Revolution to the February Revolution. The rebellion of the seasonal corps this year was not small in the intermittent turmoil of twenty years. 2</p>
<p>1849. The year after the February Revolution and the terrible June Days. Louis Napoleon was serving as president, but at this time he had controlled the Legislative Assembly and began to oppress the Republicans.</p>
<p>1859. Napoleon III was engaging in political maneuvering. He helped Italy fight Austria, but then withdrew his aid in the same year.</p>
<p>1869. The year before the Franco-Prussian War and two years before the establishment of the Third Republic.</p>
<p>1879. In the previous year's election of members of parliament, the Republicans had a great advantage. In this year, President MacMahon, who had been secretly plotting to restore the monarchy, was ousted, and the republic began to stabilize.</p>
<p>1889. The centennial of the republic was commemorated with the World's Fair and the Eiffel Tower as decorations. General Boulanger advocated retaliation against Germany, and the diplomacy of allying with Russia to contain Germany was beginning. Although Boulanger committed suicide in 1891 due to suspicion of restoring the monarchy, the Franco-Russian alliance was finally formed in 1893, which was extremely important for France's expansion of power from then on.</p>
<p>1899. France's ambitious plan to cross the African continent was frustrated by the Fashoda Incident, but its progress towards Morocco was recognized. The Dreyfus Affair was being redressed, and from this, the policy of clearing the power of the church in the next few years was launched.</p>
<p>1909. The conservative Clemenceau cabinet collapsed, and the radical forces rose to power, but the conflicts with Germany over colonial issues made the radicals' attempt to reconcile with Germany impossible. The Franco-German treaty on the Second Moroccan Crisis this year only aroused the desires of the Germans.</p>
<p>1919. The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28. Nationalism expanded to the point where even Clemenceau was considered too radical, and power was transferred to the more conservative Poincaré.</p>
<p>1929. The world economic recession began.</p>
<p>1939. Another long world war?</p>
<p>Next year's National Day, will everyone still commemorate it in war?</p>
<p>Table of Uprisings, Independence, and Persons in Charge in Each Province During the Xinhai Revolution</p>
<p>This is a photograph of representatives from various provinces gathered in Shanghai during the Xinhai Revolution, hosted by the Shanghai Commercial Association. It is also the preliminary organization of the seventeen provincial representatives, which is the parent body of the provisional government. Seated are Zhang Shen from Jiangsu, Tang Shouqian from Zhejiang, and Zhou Jinzhen from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at that time.</p>
<p>This is a handwritten letter from Huang Xing in the fourth year of the Republic of China. At that time, because Yuan Shikai had already taken active actions to claim the title of emperor and betray the country, Huang stayed in the United States and sent a special letter to the people who participated in the founding of the country during the Xinhai Revolution. Mr. Huang's literary excellence and calligraphy skills are excellent and are rare treasures among his posthumous works.</p>

<p>Reading Notes</p>
<h3>Anthology of Martyrs’ Poems: Loyalty and Righteousness Intertwined with National and Familial Grief, Stirring Readers to Profound Emotion</h3>
<p>Premier Sun once said: "A revolutionary has only two paths: success or martyrdom." Before the Xinhai Revolution, many people sacrificed their lives with the spirit of "killing oneself to achieve righteousness" and "giving up life to uphold justice." Among these patriots, some came from prominent families, some had studied abroad, and some even held superior positions in secret societies. However, they still disregarded their parents, wives, positions, honor, and personal lives. They refused to yield in the face of adversity and sacrificed themselves for the country. This showed, on one hand, that they understood the great truth that revolution requires self-sacrifice; and on the other hand, they set an example for the people to awaken sympathy and resonance. Therefore, among these patriots, although few were known for their poetry, their occasional writings were always passionate and deeply moving. For example, Luo Zhonghuo, one of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, wrote a poem expressing his feelings: "Ten years of wandering on the road of life, experienced much suffering and deep worries. Daring to say that the end can be seen in the bag, how many times thrown into the stove, who heard the sound? Often shedding tears for the sake of family and country, unable to settle grievances and not satisfied. After reading 'Li Sao' three or five times, the light of the sword and the shadow of the lamp are both silent." Another poem: "Ten years, I regret not burning books earlier, the floating reputation of experience is all illusory. Not allowed to share courage with arrogant slaves, bitterly no good price to sell the head. Before the pass, war horses raise barbarian dust, within the sea, a single cloud of great disaster. Where to get a beauty with chivalrous bones, fragrant sachet and precious sword to follow me." And in the year of Wuchen, he wrote in America: "A handful of tears at Xinting, crying all over the world and hurting again. The wind and clouds of the world have become a great calamity, the nine heavens skylark soaring freely. A hundred years of arrogance, sad barbarian captives, eternal loyalty, painful Yue Wang, how many treacherous slaves willing to sell the country, pity me facing the shadow hanging the setting sun." All are extremely painful.</p>
<p>Huang Zhongjie, another of the seventy-two martyrs, was also skilled in poetry. One of his death poems said: "For a long time, the body and world have been entrusted to insects and sand, life and death are originally just a moment. A good head thrown to the sky, freedom flowers bloom in the blood!" Especially praised by people.</p>
<p>Another example is the martyr Zhong Mingguang, who was brutally murdered for bombing Long Jiguang. His self-elegy is also full of blood and tears. Now record one of his poems as follows: "A thought to repay the kindness is still against my wishes, thirty years of thoughts are all sad. Incompetent to imitate the pillar supporting the sky, no place to accommodate the cone standing on the ground. Breaking the country and destroying the family is only anger, going through fire and water is difficult to refuse. It is expected to turn into a cuckoo, wanting to repay the filial crow in the next life."</p>
<p>For example, Qiu Jin, a woman who disdained being a moth, has many passionate and generous works. Now record three of her poems as follows: A poem expressing indignation: "The vast divine land sighs sinking, ashamed to steal life without a plan to save the time. Willing to fight sand to revive Chu, use a wave to strike the violent Qin without a hammer. Only when the country is broken do you know the race is destroyed, righteousness is high and does not hinder the poverty of guests. Regretting to operate and repay comrades, holding a sword and singing sadly, tears flow horizontally." Also, a poem in response to the Japanese Mr. Ishii, using the original rhyme: "Don't say women are not heroes. Traveling thousands of miles alone to the east, poetic thoughts a sail, the sea and sky are moist, dreams of the three islands, the moon is exquisite. The copper camel has fallen, sadly looking back, the war horse finally neighs, not yet successful. Such a sad ancestral hatred, how can I spend the spring breeze as a guest." Also, feeling in the Yellow Sea boat: "A single sail breaks the waves, the water is vast, looking back at the mountains and rivers, a single hair green. The four walls of waves rotate the earth, a day of stars crossing the Yellow Court. A thousand years of disaster, ashes all dead, ten years of washing, the water is still fishy. The sea water and gods are distant, a single body of tears on the horizon. Hearing that the ancient battlefield, still bears traces of blood. Rushing war horses, a dream of the Central Plains, shattered mountains and rivers, ashamed of the old country,钦海无权悲素寞,磨刀有恨快恩仇, The heavenly wind blows coldly across the face, a hundred thousand clouds of smoke collected in the eyes." Qiu Jin's mind is certainly not recognizable by ordinary people, and Qiu Jin's poems also have the boldness of "vast sea and sky", the momentum of surging waves.</p>
<h3>After the Wuchang Uprising, Excerpts from This Newspaper's Special Edition</h3>
<p>Yesterday (August 19th, i.e., October 10th in the solar calendar), the Wuhan revolutionary uprising destroyed all government offices below the governor-general, and the telegraph bureau and barracks were also destroyed. Governor-General Rui fled into a warship.</p>
<p>The entire New Army in the city of Hubei mutinied. A team of infantry, cavalry, and engineers, which had been transferred to defend the governor's office the previous day, revolted while bombarding the governor's office, fighting fiercely with the defense forces inside. The defense forces were then defeated and fled, and the office was also burned down.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Huang Xing led the revolutionary party in bombarding various government offices. All party members were brave and forceful, not retreating even in death.</p>
<p>This morning (the 21st), the revolutionary army besieged the Hanyang Arsenal and occupied it, obtaining 20,000 rifles and many field guns and mountain guns. The soldiers guarding the factory all expressed sympathy with the revolutionary party, so they did not resist much. The Hanyang Iron Factory was safe and undisturbed.</p>
<p>The revolutionary army has arrived in Hankou, but does not hate foreigners or disturb commerce. The Hankou customs official fled.</p>
<p>Xietong (brigadier general) Li Yuanhong is now the commander-in-chief of the revolutionary army. Notices have been posted everywhere inside and outside Wuhan: 1. No officials are allowed to be hidden privately; 2. No foreigners are allowed to be harmed; 3. No business is allowed to be infringed; 4. No foreign volunteer corps are allowed to be attacked; 5. No indiscriminate killing of comrades is allowed, violators will be sentenced to death. Rewards will also be given to those who search for and offer □ people, provide supplies and weapons, and protect the property and lives of foreigners.</p>
<p>The revolutionary army government is now fully organized. The lives and property of Europeans are safe and sound. Dozens of new people have joined the revolutionary army. Shops are open as usual. The Red Cross Society is now being organized. The revolutionary army has stopped the order of summary executions at the front. All criminals will first be studied by the Consultative Bureau and then sentenced.</p>
<p>Revolutionary troops often passed by Zhang Biao's camp, and Zhang's soldiers watched as if they hadn't seen them and did not attack.</p>
<p>The revolutionary army ordered that all military and civilians in Wuhan must cut their hair by the first day of the ninth month. Violators will be punished.</p>
<p>The revolutionary army county rewards those who report on the whereabouts of Rui Cheng with a reward of one thousand taels of silver, and those who find him will be rewarded ten times more.</p>
<p>The government is now offering a reward of ten thousand taels of silver for the head of Li Yuanhong.</p>
<p>The Wuchang Post Office has changed to use the "Great Han Post Office" stamp. The characters on the signboards of various silver shops and candy stores that say "Manchu" are all changed to use the characters "兴宇".</p>
<p>Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao are both loyal to the government, but they have both been dismissed. Li Yuanhong is the leader of the revolutionary army, but there is no explicit statement of his dismissal. People in Beijing think this is a strange thing.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen is now in Chicago, wanting to raise US$5 million to help the revolutionary army.</p>
<p>On the first day, the party sent two military officers with a letter to Yuan Shikai. Yuan received the letter but did not reply. A staff member Yang said that Yuan was ill and could not see guests, and rewarded the military officers with five hundred taels of silver. The military officers did not accept.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen, Hu Hanmin, and Chen Shaobai traveled from Singapore to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Voice of the Reader</h3>
<p>— Yangde Layman</p>
<p>My most admired and only teacher, —Shen Bao— was born in the eleventh year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1872 in the Gregorian calendar). At that time, the Manchus were in power, and the court regulations were mostly disordered. The憔悴 abused people mostly harbored resentment and tolerated abuse. The land sighed in isolation, and all news was gone. The wind and rain were as dark as night, and there was no way to express what was contained. Once the Shen Bao came out, it became a mouthpiece for expression, and assisted both sides in communicating. Therefore, the Shen Bao's merit in supporting the people's hearts and shifting the atmosphere was not small. When the Republic of China was founded, there were all kinds of reforms. The Shen Bao also gradually evolved at this time. Mr. Shi Liangcai's keen planning and careful reorganization made the business flourish, and sales spread overseas. Up to now, it not only holds the center of the national public opinion circle, but also witnesses the thick expectations of the world's audio-visual.</p>
<p>Since the "July 7th" Incident triggered the Sino-Japanese War, the Shen Bao has still appealed for justice and humanity from the standpoint of the nation and the nation. Its spirit of perseverance and hardship has also been witnessed by the world. But unfortunately, the national army retreated westward, Shanghai fell, and the situation was like 荆棘铜驼, both laughing and crying. In this helpless environment, the Shen Bao, for the sake of eliminating the darkness of justice and for the sake of the last breath of freedom, resolutely issued a cessation of publication announcement. Starting from December 15th of that year, it ceased contact with me. When I heard this news, I was completely astonished. The Shen Bao had this unexpected encounter of distress and danger, which is indeed regrettable. The Shen Bao has this firm and outstanding spirit of sacrifice, which is truly admirable. On the day of the National Day last year, the newspaper met readers again. Therefore, all of us with the same hobby still followed the admiration of the past and scrambled to subscribe. The content has not diminished from the past. It can indeed fight against the evil environment regardless of everything, and its spirit is the most commendable.</p>
<p>On this anniversary of the resumption of publication, I dare to express my humble opinions:</p>
<p>1. The only condition for the resumption of publication of the Shen Bao is to advance with the war and work hard for the country. Judging from the current situation, the flames of war are continuous, and the wars are endless. The loyal and brave soldiers are fighting fiercely. China will never change its national policy of resisting Japan until the lost land is recovered and the national shame is washed away. The final victory must belong to us. The writer earnestly hopes that the readers of this newspaper will unanimously support the government's national policy and move forward.</p>
<p>2. The Shen Bao has a sound newspaper style and a glorious history. Its comments are fair and bright, and its news is detailed and accurate. It is recognized by Chinese and foreign people. In recent years, sales have increased day by day, and this is the reason. It is hoped that the Shen Bao readers at home and abroad will take care of this mouthpiece of public opinion. (Omitted below) Yangde Layman sincerely presents</p>
<p>After the liberation, Qing official Rui Cheng fled and hid. This newspaper had a limerick on November 6th of the Xinhai year as follows:</p>
<p>Rui Cheng has gone like the yellow crane, leaving only the Yellow Crane Tower in this place; once Rui Cheng leaves, he will never return, and Wuchang will be long and long for thousands of years.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Food and Cloth Prices between the Year of Xinhai and This Year</h3>
<p>During a national revolution, everything in society moves with political turmoil. This is a certain trend. Prices, of course, are no exception, so it can be said that prices were already rising at that time, but compared with current prices, it still gives people the feeling of a little witch seeing a big witch. Below is a brief excerpt of several items, to get a glimpse.</p>

<p>Anecdotes of Famous Actors</p>
<h3>The Revolutionary Work of Pan Yueqiao and Xia Yuerun</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>The Shanghai response to the Xinhai Revolution was very early, and the battle to attack the Arsenal was glorious in party history. The actor Pan Yueqiao was actually one of the initiators. Now that the Double Ten is here, in remembrance of the difficulties of the pioneers in creating the country, the historical traces of Mr. Pan Yueqiao should be written to tell the people and the acting world. Pan has an autobiography, which was published in newspapers. The text has missing parts and can be used as historical material. What is recorded here is his anecdote.</p>
<p>The picture on the left is Pan Yueqiao</p>
<p>Showing His Talents as a Young Man</p>
<p>Yueqiao lived in Changshu, originally from Ganquan County, Yangzhou. His father's name was Fuyun, and his birth mother was Hou. His childhood name was Liansheng. He lost his father at the age of seven and was abused by his sister-in-law, suffering greatly. He was able to perform on stage at the age of nine, and was hired to come to Shanghai by the Tianxian Tea Garden at the age of sixteen. He became popular as soon as he sang. The annual contract fee was 1,600 taels of silver. At that time, not many actors had a monthly contract fee of more than one hundred taels, let alone child actors. It can be seen how popular he was.</p>
<p>Sang More Than 300 New Plays in 22 Years</p>
<p>Yueqiao sang in Tianxian's troupe for a total of 22 years. He sang the serialized play "Iron Rooster" which was very popular. His revolutionary ideas were probably already conceived in the plays of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Later, he switched to the Danggui Troupe and then joined forces with the Xia brothers to form the Xin Wutai in the Sixteen Shops, rehearsing new plays such as "The Martyr Pan Throws Himself into the Sea". At this time, his friends such as Yao Boxin were all leaders in the business world, and his revolutionary ambition became stronger. Therefore, in September of Xinhai, he advocated the attack on the Arsenal.</p>
<p>Kneeling and Crying, His Left Foot Injured</p>
<p>When attacking the Arsenal, Pan knelt on the ground and cried, begging the artillerymen to fire the cannons. The cannonballs hit the big iron gate and did not break it. Pan climbed the wall to ask the gatekeepers, and they opened the gate. After the attack was successful, he returned to the Chamber of Commerce and learned that his left foot was injured and bleeding a lot.</p>
<p>Abandoning Acting and Serving as Brigade Commander for Seven Days</p>
<p>Cen Xilin was in charge of the Sichuan-Guangdong Railway and appointed Pan as the railway brigade commander. Pan resigned from the Xin Wutai Troupe and went to Hubei to take office. The Hubei army mostly leaned towards Yuan Shikai and had a tendency to rebel. Pan knew that he could not stay for long, so he hurriedly boarded a ship with Cen Xilin and fled to Shanghai. He had only served as brigade commander for seven days.</p>
<p>Disguised as a Monk to Escape Danger</p>
<p>After the second failure in Shanghai, Pan returned to Changshu to recuperate. Zheng Ruicheng sent military police to arrest him. Early in the morning, someone sent a message to inform him. He hurriedly changed into a monk's attire and escaped to the Zhongfeng Temple and then to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Losing 80,000 in Property and Suffering Poverty in His Later Years</p>
<p>Yuan Shikai ordered his arrest, and he was to be executed on the spot when captured. With the help of Lan Tianwei, Vice President Li, and Changre Shanghai gentry, the arrest was finally cancelled. He lost more than 80,000 in family property and returned to the stage. He first joined the Danggui Troupe and then moved to the Xin Wutai in Nine Acres (rebuilt after the fire). The amount of the contract fee was only 3,000 yuan per year. Later, he went to the two Guangdongs to be an official twice. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, he returned to Shanghai due to coughing up blood. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, he encountered Shen Hongying's rebellion and returned in a state of embarrassment. He was sick for many years. His later years were decadent. At the age of 58, he said in his autobiography, "Pawning and changing things, all kinds of difficulties entered into a poor village." The end of a hero is also sad.</p>
<p>Attached Xia Yueshan and Xia Yuerun</p>
<p>Xia Yueheng, Yueshan, and Yuerun are the sons of the old actor Xia Kuizhang. Yueheng abandoned acting in his prime and joined Duanfang as a military officer. Yueshan and Yuerun had novel ideas and bold creations. They first managed the Danggui Tea Garden, and later Pan Yueqiao each invested in organizing the Xin Wutai in the Sixteen Shops, rehearsing many new plays, and taking the lead in the trend. Pan Yueqiao led people to attack the Arsenal, and the Xia brothers also helped. Yueshan originally practiced Laosheng (old male role), and later also played丑角 (clown role). I once saw him perform as Monk Ji Dian, speaking in the southern dialect, which was humorous and delightful. Yuerun practiced Wusheng (martial male role) and married Tan Xinpei's daughter. He told me personally that when he went to Beiping to greet her in person, Lao Tan ordered him to perform a play for three days in the Zhonghe Garden, actually testing his artistic ability to be worthy of being a son-in-law. On the first day, he performed "Flower Butterfly", climbed the railing, and showed off his skills, and public opinion was convinced. In the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu, he managed the Danggui and once invited his father-in-law to perform. Due to a disagreement, in the second year of Xuantong, he again invited Mr. Tan to perform at the Xin Wutai in the Sixteen Shops, which he managed. His wife went north to pick him up. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, he again invited Tan Xinpei to perform at the Xin Wutai in Nine Acres, performing for a total of ten days. Three times invited Tan, all due to kinship. When Yuerun was at his peak, as the president of the Actors' Association, people called him "Eighth Boss" instead of his name, seemingly the king of the Shanghai acting world. When he was down on his luck in his later years, he lived in the Jingtu Nunnery in Zhabei as a monk and died of illness in the nunnery. This happened half a month before the January 28th Incident.</p>
<p>A History of Cutting Braids</p>
<h3>The Ugly System of the Manchu Qing Dynasty Has Been Accumulated for a Long Time and Become a Custom. The National System Is Renovated and the National Shame Is Eradicated.</h3>
<p>Keeping braids was an ugly custom of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. After the Xinhai Restoration, all provincial military governments issued orders to cut braids. The Guangdong Military Government had a haircut order stating: "According to the fact that the Republic of China has been established, and the people are renewing themselves, the first thing to do is to wash away the smelly customs. ... Braids were the customs of the southwestern barbarians in the Han Dynasty, and the customs of the Jurchens in the Song Dynasty. The Manchus of today are another kind of Jurchen. In the second year of Shunzhi in the Qing Dynasty, Yi You, in the sixth month of the leap year, a shaving order was issued, and those who violated it would be killed without pardon. Therefore, our people all had braids hanging behind them.</p>
<p>General Order for National Haircuts</p>
<p>It has now come to this. How can our countrymen not mourn the country when they think about where the braids came from? It should be known that the old customs of our country were all to tie the hair into a bun, only between Wu and Yue, there were those who wished to cut their hair, and there were those who cut it, but there was no one who braided their hair. Braids are not a rite of our country. From now on, all of our countrymen should cut their braids to eradicate the national shame. Learn from the past, don't need to restore the custom of tying the hair, imitate the West, and hope to have the customs of Wu and Yue. Alas! Our countrymen should think about it! The rise of customs and rituals is to promote the eyes and ears, and the matters involved are not small. Patriots, there is no one who does not love customs and rituals. Wash away the dirt of old ideas, obey the orders of renovation, for this general announcement, follow it as one, sincerely..." and so on.</p>
<p>The Braid-Cutting Meeting in Daishan</p>
<p>However, at that time, the people's wisdom was not yet enlightened. Although the military governments in various places exhorted earnestly, the people were still attached to the ugly customs and still regarded this pigtail as forbidden, and refused to cut it. Therefore, there were braid-cutting meetings held in various places. Those who initiated this kind of movement mostly had newer heads. The common methods were also mostly to take "collective" action. For example, the news about the Braid-Cutting Meeting in Daishan, Dinghai, Zhejiang, published in this newspaper in October of the Xinhai year said: "Daishan in Dinghai Hall is isolated in the sea, and the atmosphere is simple. A few days ago, Zheng Ruichen, Yuan Ziqing, Jiang Chenqing, and Wang Tingsheng initiated a braid-cutting meeting at the Daidet Hall at 2 pm on September 23. The four gentlemen first cut off their own braids and explained the reasons, roughly saying: "We have been enslaved by braids for 260 years. Now that the military government of the Republic of China is hanging the people and punishing the guilty, and the provinces are gradually recovering, our fellow countrymen, the dignified descendants of the Han, should quickly cut off the rotten things. Why are you willing to be slaves like cattle and horses for a long time?" At this time, the audience was like a wall, counting more than 200 people, clapping thunderously, and rising in the wind. There were many people willing to cut it. It did not disperse until five o'clock."</p>
<p>The Braid-Cutting Meeting in Suzhou</p>
<p>The report also said about the situation of the braid-cutting meeting in Suzhou: "Since the Staff Office of the Military Government issued a notice to advise cutting braids, yesterday, someone and someone opened a special braid-cutting meeting at the Wang Renxiao Shrine in Hulong Street. A large number of people arrived at that time, and all signed up to be willing to cut. From then on, the pigtails were not left, which could avoid the ridicule of Westerners," and so on. However, at that time, most of the old leftovers were still watching, which led to the occurrence of various interesting anecdotes about the military police forcibly cutting braids.</p>

<h3>The Resurrection of Freedom</h3>
<p>— W.C. Bryant, translated by Zhou Weiyin</p>
<p>Freedom! Thou art not, as poets dream,</p>
<p>A fair young girl, with light and delicate frame,</p>
<p>And crown of flowers, and ringlets waving free,</p>
<p>A Mænad from the mountains wild,</p>
<p>Or radiant huntress, when the chase is done,</p>
<p>With weary limbs and cheeks of glowing red;</p>
<p>But stern of brow, and strong of arm,</p>
<p>A matron such as Rome had borne of old,</p>
<p>Whose iron hand made empire wide.</p>
<p>Thou art a bearded man,</p>
<p>Girt about with strength as with a cloth,</p>
<p>And wielding in thy hand a heavy sword,</p>
<p>To strike down tyranny, though armed in mail;</p>
<p>And thou hast known full well the bitter taste</p>
<p>Of slavery, and thou art not one</p>
<p>To shrink when danger lowers, or yield a field</p>
<p>Where Freedom's battle-flag has once been planted.</p>
<p>They tell us in our schools</p>
<p>How often Rome, when young, was put to flight,</p>
<p>By wild barbarians, and how often too,</p>
<p>With her proud eagle, she turned back upon them,</p>
<p>And drove them in confusion from the land;</p>
<p>And so may we, when danger threatens us,</p>
<p>With Freedom's banner, drive back the invader.</p>
<p>They tell us how the Greeks, in days of old,</p>
<p>Defended their dear land with sword in hand,</p>
<p>And drove the Persian host from off their shores;</p>
<p>And so may we, when danger threatens us,</p>
<p>With Freedom's banner, drive back the invader.</p>
<p>The cruel power, with his lightning strikes you;</p>
<p>They cannot extinguish your innate life,</p>
<p>Though cruel power has built for you the deep prison;</p>
<p>His Hessian armor,</p>
<p>Used thousands of flames,</p>
<p>Forged into your chains;</p>
<p>But, when he thought you were bound,</p>
<p>The links were shattered to pieces,</p>
<p>The prison wall has collapsed;</p>
<p>You surprisingly jump out,</p>
<p>Like a burning flame jumping from the woodpile,</p>
<p>Shouting to this nation,</p>
<p>In the whole nation responding to your call,</p>
<p>The pale-faced oppressor hides and escapes.</p>
<h3>Night Street</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>I don't necessarily yearn for distant mountains and forests, waves and bridges, plains, or vast expanses. I also enjoy strange imaginations, envisioning many different night streets.</p>
<p>A friend told me about the night street:</p>
<p>"Let me tell you, we have excellent city streets here. It's just not as you imagine, in the daytime, under the sunlight. On the contrary, it's at night. Often, when the moonlight quietly slips out of the clouds, near the cliffs along the river, a black veil is cast on the water, vaguely shrouded in a layer of shadow. At this time, the streets are bustling with voices. People who have been cooped up at home all day, old ladies supporting their children, stagger onto the main street, tirelessly nagging the shopkeepers. People from the countryside return from the countryside. Children jump and bump around in the shadows. On this night street, the shops are not very orderly, scattered sporadically in the caves of the cliffs.</p>
<p>I can't forget that one night. I went to the night street in the valley to buy something, and as I was about to go home, I was a little tired. A few friends and I sat in the park along the river for a while. The moonlight was like mercury poured on a bright mirror. On this side of the bank, a tall forest, the mountain shadows wrapped around the long night street like a large bundle. We sat in the dark and watched the moon. The bright light on the grass on the opposite bank made us seem even darker. Suddenly, majestic singing rose up behind us, and I couldn't help but be moved by them. Their songs revealed laughter and also told of bitterness. They had life, strength, and passion. I couldn't help but sigh. I was reminded of a night in my hometown two years ago. Under the moonlight, by the river, the same passionate singing—you haven't forgotten it either, have you?</p>
<p>"Homesick? I don't want to assume that. Because I feel very good here. The sun, the air, the passion of the flames, everything suits me well. Especially the night street, it's extremely interesting and extremely moving. Okay, imagine—lights scattered among the forests and valleys at the foot of the mountains along the river, with the crude figures of people stirring... That's the night street, that's the night street."</p>
<p>I read it and wrote a reply. What particularly caught my attention was a question:</p>
<p>"Are you really homesick?"</p>
<p>Three months later, a reply came:</p>
<p>"No, I'm really not homesick at all. I'm very good here. I love the night street here. In the night street, the mountain air blends with unfamiliar hearts. Allow me to retract my previous statement. I no longer plan to reminisce."</p>
<p>Regarding the night street, how can I not reminisce? I wrote a letter, writing about my hometown two years ago and a similar section, expressing my envy for the night street in the valley.</p>
<p>"What you remember, I have not forgotten either. On the narrow street paved with bluestone, the signs on the left-hand side almost touch the eaves of the houses on the right. Walking on the uneven road, people squeezed together to pass. In the dark alleyways, in the late autumn, there is the sound of an iron shovel scraping against a pot, that is, the seller of fried ginkgo nuts. From a desolate road, you can often see a group of passengers coming down from the late train at the station, the oil lamps on the rickshaws forming a long string. You can hear the barking of dogs in the remote alleys. A few rays of light leak out from the cracks in the wooden door of the small inn, welcoming customers with warmth…"</p>
<p>After writing it, I regretted it. I just put the letter down and didn't mail it. I simply wrote a few other lines:</p>
<p>"I imagined it and envied it... Lights scattered among the forests and valleys at the foot of the mountains along the river, with the crude figures of people stirring. I love the sun, the air, the passion of the flames there... Ah, especially the night street, the night street…"</p>
<p>He really doesn't need to be homesick. He has something more lovable than his hometown. Life is more fulfilling, people are more passionate, the streets are more interesting, and nature is even greater.</p>
<p>But I can't help but feel a kind of nostalgia. On a brightly lit night, the sky sparkles with red and green neon lights. Vehicles like cunning rabbits chasing the wind are constantly running and flowing. The sounds of people and cars mix into a burst of noise on the road. There is dust and powder in the air… Isn't this also a night street? A night street where people with full pockets indulge to their heart's content?… I can't help but write down a little envy or reminiscence:</p>
<p>"The night street of my hometown makes me reminisce, and the night street of the valley makes me envy. I can't help but fantasize."</p>
<p>I sent another letter to my friend.</p>
<h3>Fallen Leaves</h3>
<p>— Xiao Fang</p>
<p>Sitting in the garden, the leaves on the branches fell down with a rhythm, occasionally floating onto my friend. She fiddled with them carefully. (Was she studying whether they were parallel-veined or reticulate-veined?)</p>
<p>"It's really strange, the leaves always fall in autumn." This imaginative friend was a little sentimental about the very ordinary natural phenomenon, and then imitated Prince Hamlet's soliloquy, resting her chin on her hand. I was silent.</p>
<p>"Why don't you say anything? Weren't you just complaining about not being able to take a philosophy of life course because of a time conflict? Actually, that doesn't matter much. Life is alive, textbooks are dead; you can't learn anything in the university classroom. But, think about the fate of these leaves! It will help you understand the mysteries of life."</p>
<p>So, I picked up a fallen leaf and fiddled with it too. From being green and exciting to see, to being a withered yellow, is the course of its life. Just like flowers blooming and falling, the good times of a full moon and a crescent moon do not last long. I was reminded of a pile of rise and fall of people and events. And melancholy covered my field of thought like a veil, and I couldn't help but feel a little tired.</p>
<p>"The west wind sweeps away the fallen leaves. They will inevitably drift in the world and destroy their traces." My friend said, her serious appearance like a philosopher. "But, after the cold winter, new leaves will grow. Compared to the universe, the life of an individual is only a small point of nothing, so naturally, there is no need to despise its existence. However, one must recognize that people should pave the way and build bridges for the whole and future generations. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>I was brought into a deeper realm, and remained silent; wanting to think about it quietly for a while longer. I knew I was lacking a bit of health.</p>

<h3>"Change"</h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>The conflict and struggle between opposing things is inevitable, and only then can a higher stage be reached. This is inevitable in the course of history, and is called "change." Hegel has spoken of it in detail.</p>
<p>Let me give an example from history: Wang Mang, a man of petty cunning, and Li Zicheng, a bandit from Mizhi, may seem distressing and frightening to some historians; however, if they had handled political and economic policies and mass movements well at the time, later historians might have added the glorious title of "Emperor Gaozu" to them. But can we say that their "change" was accidental? Of course not!</p>
<p>Shang Yang abolished the "well-field system"(?), equalized weights and measures, and went against the ancient ways. If you apply gentleness and sincerity to it, it would inevitably lead to the pursuit of legalism, meanness, and even to his own destruction, being torn apart by chariots, which seems like a pity; but explaining it from the perspective of the rise of the commercial bourgeoisie at that time is naturally not as simple as the imagination of moralists.</p>
<p>The most bizarre thing in history is Wang Anshi, although Liang Qichao later regarded him as one of the greatest statesmen. It seems that there is no real evidence that he usurped the throne, and it is too wrong to say that he was a robber "wandering around". "Heavenly changes are not to be feared, ancestral laws are not to be followed, and people's words are not to be cherished" is already outside the classics, but even more hated by the likes of Su Xun is that he "talks about poetry and books while wearing mourning clothes." Being unkempt is like begging, and singing lotus chants would be fine, but he insists on talking about poetry and books, "filling the role of a Confucian," and from this he "reforms the law"; and his literary skills are so high that he can write excellent articles, so he is inevitably worse than Lu Qi, simply a flood or a beast. So, oppose, oppose!</p>
<p>The reason for the opposition lies in complacency, conservatism, and the maintenance of one's own interests—"change" is troublesome, wouldn't the status of the old landlords and bourgeoisie be shaken as a result? Indeed, Wang Anshi's reform was aimed at all the bad systems in the agricultural society at that time, and in general, it acknowledged the interests of the middle peasants, which would undoubtedly give the great landlords and bourgeoisie a severe blow. Look: the "Green Sprouts Law" used the cash from the state and county granaries to help the common people, so that they could cultivate in time, which precisely eliminated the exploitation of usury; the "Market Regulation Law" lent capital to small merchants to regulate social supply, so that large commercial capital could not monopolize and hoard goods for profit; and the "Order of Law Enforcement" also prevented landlord bureaucrats from manipulating and embezzling funds; the "Baojia Law" stabilized the locality and eliminated bandits, but when the war of resistance broke out, the national conscription would inevitably cause trouble for the landlords' young masters, which was also unacceptable to them!</p>
<p>What they did was to muddle along, "passing away like this, and never returning; waxing and waning like that, and never decreasing or increasing." The "change" in the world is an "illusion", and I was there from the beginning? "You can look at it from the perspective of its unchanging nature, and things and I are all endless." Drink and sing, how long is life? "The clear wind on the river, the bright moon among the mountains," come on, be intoxicated. "What I and you enjoy together, jibber jabber!" Regardless of the invasion of the northeast Liao, the rise of the northwest Western Xia, the frequent foreign troubles over the years, and the great social unrest, jibber jabber—I want to order wine, hiccup! However, from a historical point of view, not only because of ordering wine, "hearing" is a warning, but Wang Anshi's heroic performance of "change" may also be a wake-up call: although he had a ruthless conflict with his opponents, he did not get the greater sympathy of the lower class and have a good connection with them; and the bureaucrats Cai Jing and Zhang Dun, whom he used in administration, actually fulfilled the task of profiting from it and not benefiting the lower class. No wonder Wang Anshi left a stain in the history of Chinese political movements.</p>
<p>"Change" is inevitable, and subjective promotion must have "strength"; is the "person" who "does not care about people's words" the masses or the minority?</p>
<p>On the other hand, we must point out: there is also no "unchanging thing" in the intoxicated enjoyment of drinking wine; Ruan the bearded man desperately devoted himself to "nine wrongs and ten wrongs", but he still performed between banquets, only "changing to death."</p>

<h3>National Day and the Performing Arts Circle</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>Today is Double Ten National Day, which reminds me of the activities of the performing arts circle on National Day in the past. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the performing arts circle was very active on National Day, truly a so-called celebration throughout the land.</p>
<p>Just speaking of Shanghai, on National Day, general cinemas, whether showing domestic or foreign films, would choose good new films, and regardless of sunny or rainy weather, every show would be full, with a grand scene no less than the Winter Solstice and New Year. Therefore, some cinemas had to add one or two more shows. In addition to paid movies, there were also free movies, which were borrowed by the authorities and shown to the public for free. At the same time, the movie employees of various film companies also had to hold a grand celebration.</p>
<p>Beijing opera theaters were no exception. On this day, famous actors would adjust their lineups and perform famous plays.</p>
<p>In the amusement parks, every troupe performed wonderful performances, and each artist would say a few auspicious words to celebrate the Double Ten when they took the stage. Dance halls were also open all night, with particularly lively dancers, celebrating all night, like Christmas and New Year.</p>
<p>In addition, there were also non-professional artists from schools and groups performing various performances, opening grand variety shows: crosstalk, music, dramas, the lively situation is difficult to describe in words.</p>
<p>Now that Shanghai has become an "isolated island," although it is National Day, it is far from as lively as in the past. We can only recall the past situation and hope that China's final victory will come soon, and after Shanghai returns to its original state, we can see this grand scene of National Day again!</p>
<h3>Actress Song Dezhu Talks About: Practicing Qiao Gong and Fighting Hand to Hand (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Leng Fang</p>
<p>Editor's introduction: Song Dezhu, courtesy name Yingzhi, is from Tianjin, 23 years old, and is a rising talent among the "Four Little Famous Dan" in the old capital, uniquely skilled in both civil and military arts, and renowned at the time. This is her first time coming to the south, and her performance at the "Golden Stage" has been a sensation, demonstrating her true talent and skills. This reputation is well-deserved. This self-description of her acting experience shows her deep dedication and the great difficulty of martial arts plays, which is also very interesting.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Artists</h3>
<p>I am a junior actor in the theatrical world. I entered the Peking Opera School in Beiping at the age of fourteen and studied for seven and a half years until graduating in the summer of the year before last. Since then, I have formed my own troupe, the Yingguang Society, and performed locally for less than two years. I know that my skills are still shallow and I need to work harder and seek guidance from all aspects. Therefore, what I am willing to say can only be limited to my experience and humble opinions on learning and practicing acting.</p>
<p>First Learning Martial Arts</p>
<p>I was in the first class at the opera school. Therefore, the school followed the "De He Jin Yu…" ranking, and I was in the De class, so my stage name is Dezhu. The opera school rules stipulated that, except for martial arts, there was "women playing women, men playing men." I originally only specialized in martial arts plays; later, the school authorities believed that I had a good talent and was very suitable for singing Qingyi and Huashan plays, so they were willing to break the rules and began to teach me Huadan. I remember this happened in the fourth year of entering the school. The vice-principal, Mr. Li Boyan, came to the school at seven o'clock every morning to play the erhu and warm up my voice. He was very enthusiastic and cared for me very much, and he was particularly strict with me. He even broke the erhu because I was not very focused, using it as a powerful stimulus. At the same time, it was obvious that the principal was too fond of a student when he played the instrument, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the students. Mr. Li still remained the same, without any consideration. Therefore, being able to sing civil plays with this voice after learning martial arts is really all thanks to Mr. Li's creation, and I will always be grateful and unforgettable.</p>
<p>Guidance from Famous Teachers</p>
<p>When I first learned martial arts plays, I was guided by Yu Yuqin, Guo Jixiang, Zhu Guifang, and Yan Shaoqiu. Mr. Yu's name was Zhuang, and he specialized in martial arts, and he was also the creator of the "Thirteenth Sister" play. Mr. Guo's stage name was Shui Xianhua, and he played both Huadan and martial arts. His qiao gong was really too good. Mr. Zhu and Yan (also known as Jiuzhenfeng) were both excellent famous actors in the martial arts line. Therefore, after years of training, I was able to achieve a little success in martial arts, which was all due to the guidance of these good teachers. But unfortunately, Mr. Yu and others have long since passed away, and I have no possibility of receiving further instruction!</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Merry-Go-Round</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Behind the Twentieth Century Fox studio in Hollywood, there is a large garden dedicated to filming outdoor scenes. There are models of many world-famous attractions in the garden, such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the streets of New York, and the pyramids of Egypt, with realistic scenery. There is also a delicate electric merry-go-round, which is specially for the top child star Shirley Temple to play with. Originally, Shirley Temple was very active by nature. When filming became impatient, she became sleepy and listless, and went on strike. The director could not do anything, so he consulted with a child psychologist, and according to the plan, he built a merry-go-round in the pavilion of the back garden, so that when she felt tired, she could ride the horse and circle around, stimulating her spirit. The installation of the pavilion is an active dance floor with a rotating axis in the middle and eight wooden horses around it, covered with embroidered saddles, swaying and running very fast. After Shirley Temple rides the wooden horse, she becomes energetic and willing to continue filming. In the beginning, the director thought this was just a way to deal with children, but after a long time, the other adult actors also became addicted to riding horses like Shirley Temple, and they could not pass the audition without it. Therefore, Miss Shirley Temple's eight wooden horses have a tendency to never stop all day long, and more and more comrades are riding horses.</p>

<h3>The Feminine Elegance Art in the Mouth of a Female Star</h3>
<p>Zorina, this elegant woman, is a famous Hollywood dance star. She started practicing dance in kindergarten. She said that every woman can become elegant, but just pay attention to a few simple rules.</p>
<p>She said that when a woman sits, she should avoid posing; but she must remember to be calm—a woman should have a calm and leisurely attitude. She should cross her ankles, not her knees. Sit on the chair at an angle, and place her hands naturally on her knees.</p>
<p>A lively and lovely appearance can create a vivid and agile personality. When a woman is in action, she can show her liveliness and attract attention, but this action must be elegant and dignified.</p>
<p>Zorina said that when walking, one must have a graceful posture, using the legs to focus on the toes, using the arms elegantly, and using them in a balanced manner.</p>
<p>When standing still, the body should be sideways, not directly facing the front. When speaking to people, one foot should be slightly forward, and the weight of the body should be supported on the other foot. (Xie)</p>
<h3>Giant Movie Premieres in New York; 20,000 Movie Fans Wait for the Opening</h3>

Before 9:00, more than 6,000 movie fans had already entered the theater. According to police estimates, from the theater ticket office north to 51st Street, east to 8th Avenue, south to 50th Street, and west to Broadway, there were no less than 20,000 people shoulder to shoulder. Such a grand scene is truly unprecedented. It is heard that this film will arrive in Shanghai soon and will be shown at the soon-to-open Dahua Theater. Chess Garden</p>
