<h3>德蘇協定劃分東歐勢力範圍　並發宣言要求英法停戰　英法表示拒絕並決作戰到底　蘇聯與愛沙尼亞訂「互助條約」</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯外交委員長莫洛托夫與愛沙尼亞外交部長賽爾特、從事締結兩國互助條的及商務協定之談判、自九月二十四日起歷時五日、至昨日業已圓滿吿成、所有互助條的及商務協定均已簽字、斯達林亦參加其事、（二十九日塔斯電）</p>
<p>莫期科　愛沙尼亞與蘇所訂互助條的、曾允蘇聯在愛沙尼亞境內設立海軍根據地與若干飛機塲及駐陸軍之權、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯委員長會議主席兼外交委員長莫洛托夫與德國外交部長李賓特洛甫九月廿七廿八兩日進行締結德蘇友好及劃界條約談判、在塲參加者蘇方有斯達林及蘇聯駐德大使磨克伐樂夫、德方有德國駐蘇大使舒倫堡、結果雙方簽定德蘇友好及劃界條約、此外、兩國政府並共同發表宣言、莫洛托夫與李賓特洛甫又交換關於經濟問題之公函、（二十九日塔斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　蘇德兩國政府今日發表宣言云、「蘇聯及德意志兩國政府本日簽定條約之後、業已澈底解決因波蘭國瓦解而發生之諸問題、從而創立東歐永久和平之堅定基礎、兩國政府爰同意表示意見、認定清理目前德國與英法兩國間之戰爭、乃與一切國家之利益符合、因此兩政府今後將共同努力、必要時並與其他友邦協同設法於最短期內達到上述目的、苟兩政府此項努力仍歸無效、則由此將證明英法兩國應負戰爭延續之責任、而苟戰爭延續、蘇德兩國政府將互相諮詢有關之必要步驟」、蘇聯政府授權莫洛托夫德國政府代表李賓特洛甫簽字、（二十九日塔斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　德國交部長里賓特洛浦、本日正午十二時四十分、乘坐飛機返國（廿九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據此間可靠方面今日稱、英政府對於蘇德兩國國之聯合和平建議、的將出之拒絕之一途、並將重申繼續作戰、直至戰事目標貫澈、希特勒主義崩潰而止、（二十九日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社外交訪員聲稱、官方對於蘇德劃界之新協定、雖尙未見有何反響、惟消息靈通方面陳述其觀念如下、張伯倫首相曾於最近發言時聲明、蘇聯之行動不影響英法作戰至達到目的之决心云、德蘇協定對於戰事之繼續、雖考量及之、但僅規定德蘇間之商榷換言之、即德國須繼續讓步、以換取蘇聯軍事上援助、英政府將立即與法國商權、對於德蘇恊定所應採之態度、至於蘇聯與愛沙尼亞之關係、不過爲史丹林效法希特勒策略之又一徵象而已云、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　關於莫斯科方面最近發展情形、此問官方雖未正式作何表示、但據消息靈通人士談稱、英國對於德國和平攻勢、唯有以「否」答之、各民治國作戰目標、業由張伯倫首相於本月十七日在歐洲方面、澈底剷除暴力制度、準此而論、德國雖與蘇聯同謀、在波蘭國獲有成就、但英法兩國所由作戰之問題、並不因而消滅、反之、英法兩國所抱目標、且愈益顯明、其將作戰到底以達到最後勝利、實無疑可言云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據此間消息、英法今日互商德蘇之和平建議、英內閣亦開會討論、（二十九日透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法國消息靈通人士宜稱、德蘇雖締結協定、法國仍決心作戰、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>梵蒂岡　教廷今日吾認德國所傳、敎廷刻正與英法聯合作和平運動、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯向英表示　謂仍保守中立　並願進行商務談判</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間蘇聯人士頃宣稱、蘇聯願與英國討論各項商務問題、邁斯基大使現正等候英國政府提出建議、並望英國能以「友好」態度對待蘇聯、英國政界人士從而加以評論云、蘇聯之意、殆欲英國政府遣派商務代表團、以大員如商務大臣史丹萊之僑爲之領導、前往莫斯科進行談判、此事正在政府考慮中云、（二十八日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間負資人士頃證實、蘇聯大使邁斯基近頃與哈里法克斯外相晤談時、曾經說明兩點、（一）蘇聯對於現行戰事所宜佈之中立政策、仍當信守不渝、（二）蘇聯政府準備與英國進行商務談判云、一般人以爲此項立塲是吾將有事實爲之證明、尙未可卜、至於莫斯科方面昨日雖有重要發展、顧此際並無理由可以懷疑邁斯基大使之表示、缺乏誠意、（哈瓦斯二十八日電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據可靠消息、蘇聯在西歐戰事中所行政策、乃係一種「堅强的中立政策、」亦可目爲「武裝的中立政策、」同時在巴爾幹半島與黑海方面則積極樹立覇權、並在波羅的海沿岸排斥英法德三國勢力，迫令德國以全力應付西歐局勢、此種政策、倘若失敗、或當出以較爲强硬之態度、要而言之、蘇聯外交政策具有五重目標、（一）限制土耳其在巴爾幹半島所保有之勢力、使之保守中立、並代蘇聯保衛黑海、同時又加以牽制、使之不能積極援助英法兩國、以對付德國、從而破壞巴爾幹半島之均勢、至地中海方面、蘇聯並無利害關係、故土耳其與英法兩國所訂協定、關於地中海之各條款、仍可聽由土耳其予以尊重、換言之、土耳其在地中海之行動、不予何種束縛、但達達尼爾海峽乃黑海之咽喉、則應避免軍事行動、（二）羅馬尼亞。保加利亞。南斯拉夫三國、應搆成中立集團、置於蘇聯與土耳其兩國共同勢力之下、羅國多勃魯伽地方、在上决歐戰之前、屬於保加利亞國、當物歸原主、羅國倘能接受蘇聯之控制、則貝薩拉比亞省問題（上决歐戰之前屬於俄國）不妨暫緩解決、（三）德國得在巴爾幹半島取獲經濟讓與權、但以不搆成專營權爲條件、（四）德蘇兩國之間、或可組織波蘭緩衝國、但以德國接受以上各點爲條件、（五）波羅的海沿岸愛沙尼亞國應劃入蘇聯勢力範圍、拉脫維亞或亦在其列、至立陶宛國則可劃入德國勢力範國、凡此五點實現之後、德國得向東歐與東南歐擴張勢力之地帶、自己爲之减少、但可以全力應付西歐戰事、故蘇聯方面以爲德國定必予以接受、吾則蘇聯或須出以較爲强硬的態度、此間外交界人士從而加以評論云、德國此次啟釁、原欲征略東歐、茲因蘇聯威脅之故、已不得不將原議作罷、至土耳其此後在巴爾幹半島方面之勢力、亦必爲之减少、而其他各國在巴爾幹之勢力、則完全消滅、不得不聽由蘇聯樹立覇權、至義大利國態度如何、猶在未定之天、但因蘇聯在巴爾幹半島勢力日益膨脹之故、殆未必漠然坐視而無所反應、即以德國而論、其非戰目標原欲在東南歐發展經濟勢力、恐亦未必甘心聽命於蘇聯也、此外、英國外交界人士又以德國採取「和平攻勢」之可能性、作爲談論資料、僉謂此事若果見諸實際、必爲英法兩國所拒絕、目前問顯所在、厥爲蘇聯是吾贊助德國此種攻勢、關於此點、倫敦蘇聯人士均謂、蘇聯雖或贊助和平攻勢、但若英法兩國加以拒絕、蘇聯亦不擬援助德國、要而言之、蘇聯對於英法兩國仍復嚴守中立、但以各該國不向東南歐洲各國行使壓力爲條件、蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基昨日業以此意、吿知英國外相哈里法克斯矣、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　德國與蘇聯簽訂各項協定之後、此間各觀察家頃加以評論、咸謂各該國所推行之政策、可以四字概括之、即「恫嚇·封鎖·波羅的·巴爾幹」是也、（即Bluff，Blockade，Baltic，Balkans四字亦即所謂四B政策）至以此四字所引起之種種問題而論、首先三字所包括者、至少已在莫斯科切實解決、抑德幽向英法兩國所當提出之「和平的哀的美頓書」、或當以該國與蘇聯簽訂軍事同盟條的之威脅爲之後盾、但各該國咋所業表之聯合宜言、幷未提及同盟條的字樣、僅謂和平攻勢若果失敗、各該國政府即當「互相諮詢」而已、反之、德蘇兩國所簽訂之經濟協定、其內容甚屬切實、德國因英法兩國實行封鎖、無從取給之資源一部份、可由蘇聯加以供給、特蘇聯亦祇能供給「一部份」而巳、一般人對於德國圖謀與蘇聯成立協定之舉、原甚焦慮、迨審視各該國昨日所簽訂之各項協定、曁上月廿三日所簽訂之互不侵犯條約、即知德國與蘇聯討價還價時、所給與者究爲何物、但蘇聯所出代價如何、則無從知之、須待事實爲之證明、此與德國前與蘇聯簽訂互不侵犯條的情形、正復相同、所可注意者、德國在波蘭設立緩衝國之議、旣予以放棄、其對於蘇聯與愛沙尼亞國相互關係、亦無發言餘地、茲者愛沙尼亞國已與蘇聯簽訂互助協定、殆即在實際上淪爲蘇聯之保護國、而在軍事上政治上失去自主權、即其國外貿易亦且爲蘇聯所獨佔、關於此層、此間消息靈通人士咸謂、當蘇聯軍隊開入波蘭之際、愛沙尼亞政府曾向德國提出交涉、請其在蘇聯以壓力相加時加以保護、德國政府當即答稱、蘇聯對於波羅的海沿岸各國並無野心、準此而論、德國顯已被迫而放棄其在該方面所佔有之地位矣、至以巴爾幹半島問題而論、士耳其國外長薩拉茹格魯已在莫斯科有所活動、務使德蘇兩國在未經土國參加之前、勿逕自予以解决、但巴爾幹半島終屬德國所獲接濟之地、他日蘇聯與土國進行談判時、自必注意及此云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>歐戰現階段中之蘇聯</h3>
<p>歐戰以德波開火爲發軔，迄今已整整一月。此一月中，風雲開闔，演變已相當繁複；但操縱自如，始終左右時局者厥惟蘇聯。往事無論矣；如今日者，德外長里賓特羅甫方再度蒞蘇，有所商談，而倫敦方面即亟謀追踵繼武，甚至特派大員，擬及耆年碩德之勞合喬冶其人，俾藉其聲光威望，以釋月餘以前僅有所謂「二等角色」赴蘇聘問之愆。波蘭畫界纔告厥成，而波羅的海之一角，忽起暗雲，東歐局面由是而未許樂觀；乃至昨日，蘇愛互助公的忽又吿成，於是波海頓趨安靜，影響所及，會使東歐半壁，風塵止息。然則莫斯科者，誠今日時局之重心，比擬前史，則游談之士，躡屩以趨，報聘之使，絡繹在途，咸陽臨淄，或足以喻其盛况。抑各國使者羣向莫斯科，趨蹌惟恐或後，卒未聞蘇聯馳使他邦，有所圖謀：然則主客異勢，輕重可見，蘇聯在今日，謂爲掌握時局之關鍵者，未爲過也。</p>
<p>歐戰發展至現階段，謂爲結束不遠，固屬言之過早；然謂爲方興未艾，非演成長期戰爭不可者，亦無非或然之假定。德國之足以逞强者兵力，其不可掩飾之弱點則爲經濟貧乏，故利在速戰速決；英法兵力固不示弱於德，而經濟狀况則應付裕如，故不妨持久周旋。德國雖願速戰速決，英法不願，則事實上固非持久不可：但德國欲掩蓋弱點，在不得不持久之中勉圖掙扎，則允非在經濟方面有所綢繆不可。蘇聯者，物資充盈，有餘力可以助人，固德國所憧憬之對象也。又羅馬尼亞自經蘇聯陳兵波境以後，已囊括於蘇聯勢力之下；而此邦農產豐富，油田連綿，固亦德國所憧憬者也。故德國今後之出路，惟在拉攏蘇聯同，資爲己助；車事同盟藉日未能，次焉者若經濟之支持亦足以慰其大願。英法之意願則與德國相反，凡德國所欣望其成功者，英法必盡力解消之，故釜底抽薪，厥惟乘德國拉攏蘇聯尙未成熟之時，與之循同一之道路，亦結歡於蘇聯。總之，今日縱橫捭闔之局，無非爲未來歐洲新局面之醖釀，醖釀之結果將何如，則蘇聯誠得而左右之耳。</p>
<p>蘇聯足以左右今日及今後之歐局，由於環境使然，亦由於十餘年來養精蓄銳實力充沛使然，此誠非倖致之事，然亦決不能以此沾沾自喜。蓋唯其有舉足重輕之勢，則此一舉足之間必須出之以審慎，設有差池，影響滋甚。一月餘來之蘇聯，誠已屢作驚人之舉，然其堅守自身之立塲則始終一貫。其與德國訂的，以互不侵犯而止；與日本成立諾蒙亨協定，允僅以當地暫停戰事爲範圍；至於最近對愛沙尼亞則竟作互助公的。因對象之不同，輒異其外交運用之方式，此非僅世俗之所謂圓活，蓋唯其如此，乃可自動，乃可執持自身之立塲而不爲環境所左右。然則其今後之舉措，猶是審愼，猶是執持自身之立塲，固絕不致因沾沾自喜而自亂其步調。顧吾人有所望於蘇聯者，則允願其能憑藉當前優越之地位，發揮其積極之作用，使歐洲局面，甚至世界局面具澄淸之觀。</p>
<p>歐洲戰事，世人初以爲反侵略之戰爭，顧當捷克奧地利阿爾巴尼亞等遭受宰割之時。不聞英法等國仗義執言；而蘇聯所力倡之集體安全制度，英法等國亦自始未能推誠相與，使底於成；迨但澤問題迫於眉睫，英法自身行且感受威脅之時，乃不得不起而援助，顧猶徘徊於齊格斐防綫之前者將近匝月，波蘭事實上已屆破滅，而西綫猶毫未發揮牽制作用；然則此决歐戰，謂非如二十五年前帝國主義之爭奪戰，固不能令人無疑，特英法方面取防禦之姿態，故遂幻爲反侵略之表象耳。强國相斫之戰，其過程爲一塲混戰，其結果除改造一部分地圖外必無甚意味。當戰事初起，蘇聯表示置身事外，顧乃倏忽興兵，吞波蘭者强半；不但不參相斫之戰，且號稱中立而莫或揭其非；不但坐地分贓，且使交戰國家之雙方趨承之惟恐不及；人類文明於是而倒退三十年，然蘇聯因緣時會，巧取豪奪，轉瞬之間，得此成就，固已蔚爲歷史奇蹟，帝俄時代夢寐求之而求之不得者也。所足稱道者，凌弱矣，然同時抑强；蓋英法與德國相爭相斫，無論勝敗如何，必因蘇聯抑揚其間而莫復能稱覇。世人或以波蘭爲鑑，疑蘇聯或將以同一方法，與日本瓜分中國；（見昨日莫斯科電）是則不但凌弱，且將助長日本之强且覇；蘇聯固愚不至此，抑中國備具立國之一切優秀條件，豈波蘭所得與相提並論，而獻城乞降，任人宰割哉！</p>

<h3>金融　掉期利率終嫌高昂　外滙多頭不少了結</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市況、匯豐掛牌俱無上落、英美匯暗市、因鑒報載王外長談中日戰事、美如調解、成功可能性較大云云、而一般無實力之九月份多頭、因交割日期逼近、且掉期利息愈高、故乃祇得忍痛斬結、兼華行亦來吐售英金、雖一部份華商曾有扒吸、但因外行吃胃不健、而供意仍佳、致市勢遂趨强硬、午收英金計四便士三七五、美匯爲七元三七五、午後日行正金與華商雖有扒進、但有利某行等外行賣意殊强、故仍難脫鬆勢、結果以當日最鬆價英金四便士四三七五、美匯七元四三七五收盤、較隔昨英硬一二五、美賤二一八七五、收後爲狀略轉軟化、至十月份期貨趨勢因九月份即須交割、故一部份不願晚手者、祇得掉期、且貼進者仍頗稀少、致鬆度較現貨爲遜、照晚收英金距離一五六二五、美匯相差三一二五、約合月息（除佣）爲四分一厘六、中途聞華比貼予華商美金二五、約合月息（除佣）爲三分三厘六、而華商亦曾貼予某行美金三七五、約合月息爲四分九厘九、全天交易尙旺、</p>
<p>掉期交易稍有做開</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期縮半便士、遠期降五六二五、紐的銀價跌二分、倫教生金呆定、滙兌英對美·對滬·對法均平、美對英續大一二五、對滬長一角、對法升二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨則現貨賣價、英金四便士三一二五、美滙七元二五、較之前收、英平美微硬〇三一二五、乃滙兌略長之故、開後華行首來塞予外行現貨英金四便士三四三七五及三七五、繼而某美行等亦吐予華商現貨、美滙由七元二五長至三七五、同時有利賣予華商十月份美匯七元〇六二五、是以過程鬆硬、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉小二分七五、此後某行吸進同行十月份美匯七元一二五、嗣後成交稍淸「但九十月份掉期仍有做開、故爲狀乃形略定、聞外行華比貼予套和者美金二五、的合月息（除佣）爲三分三厘六、午刻華商貼予某行美金三七五、的合月息爲四分九厘九、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四便士三七五、美匯七元三七五、較晨開英鬆〇六二五、美硬一二五、</p>
<p>外商銀行賣意亦濃</p>
<p>午後因外行有利大通等賣意頗濃、雖日行正金與華商等稍來吸收、但仍難脫鬆勢、計有利售予同行現貨英金四便士四〇六二五及四三七五、繼之大通某行亦賣予同行及華商現貨美滙七元三七五及叫三七五、時有利又吐予日行正金十月份美滙七元一二五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四便士四三七五、美匯七元四三七五、本月份與現貨相同、十月份英金四便士二八一二五、美匯七元一二五、結果比上日現貨與本月英均鬆一二五、美俱硬二一八七五、七月份英祇鬆〇一五六二五、美則賤〇九三七五、聞收後價况略形回軟、銀行現貨賣價英金四便士四〇六二五、美滙七元四〇六二五、十月份美匯七元一二五雞結、</p>

<h3>各方止進爲出　黃金跌風突起</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、連漲二日復又趨疲、蓋以報載外長王寵惠氏談話中、略有關於和平空氣一節、外滙因之鬆動、故晨初即見降落爲四千一百十元開盤、嗣因銀樓帮與現金號等均紛紛塞出、但錢兌業代客方時起買風、兼上日傾吐之某金號亦稍來復進、故跌風尙緩、價遂掙扎於四千一百元至零五十元之間、午牧價爲四千零六十五元、午後初開略疲、爲四千零五十五元、旋因證券帮及錢兌業拉提、一度回高至四千零七十五元、入後聞外滙父報鬆硬、浮多前來斬結、目證券帮亦止進猛塞、加之客帮人都趦趄不前、故一時跌風頗烈、竟退達四千零二十元低價收盤、較上日暴落一百零三元、聞收後初時因證券帮　賣風仍熾、且缺乏維持、竟破入四千元大關、達三千九百九十五元低盤、旋聞外滙收後稍形回軟、故趨勢遂反動上漲、回遠四千零二十元光景、交易仍旺、的二千餘兩、銀樓飾金步落十五元、海關金等仍無變化、</p>
<p>烚赤猛跌百餘元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開局勢欠佳、外滙潛勢帶硬、買方均審愼觀望、開市遂做小十三元、某金號售予錢兌業十兩、爲四千一百十元、開後銀樓帮與現金號均紛來吐塞、形勢又疲、續跌五十元、銀樓帮賣予錢兌業十兩、及某金號三十兩、均爲四千零六十元、時某錢兌業忽代客方吸收、立回高四十元、錢兌業進證券帮二十兩、爲四千一百元、此後買方吃胃漸弱、且外滙仍難脫鬆勢、加之銀樓帮賣風又起、遂不支下瀉、竟撳小五十元、現金號吐予錢兌業十兩、爲四千零五十元、旋以某金號趁低吸收、跌風頓止、不久即回上三十元、某金號進銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千零八十元、將近午刻、某錢兌獎突來復出、且金號已止進觀望、復向下游、未幾回落二十元、錢兌業賣予銀樓帮三十兩、爲四千零六十元、繼而另一錢兌業進金號二十兩、爲四千零六十五元、作午收價、午後初開帶吱、　午收做小十元、金號賣予錢兌業十兩、爲四千零五十五元、開後錢兌業稍有納胃、兼證券帮亦前來吸收、遂抬高二十元、錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、及證券帮進錢兌業二十兩、均爲四千零七十五元、入後聞外滙趨鬆、證券帮頓止進復出、且零星賣戶亦接踵而來、故乃反動猛跌、竟暴落五十五元、錢兌業售予金號二十兩、爲四千零二十元作晚收價、結果比上日猛跌一百零三元、聞收後塲內趨勢愈疲、某銀號售予現金號十兩、價祇四十元、繼而證券帮吐予錢兌業十兩、價爲三千九百九十五元、同時銀樓帮賣予證券帮現金號錢兌業共四十兩、價均與上價相同、後某銀號復進錢兌業十兩、價爲四千元、全天九十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進减低三十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>

<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出，初時大同行仍懸四百二十元、迨至九時三十分掛小五元、十時又低五元、下午四時三十五分再小五元、此後無變化、計大同行改懸四百零五元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减小二十元光景、</p>
<h3>昨日發行之分幣券</h3>
<p>中央銀行之分幣券首批發行額、計一分券三十萬元、五分券二十萬元、係由美商永寗公司承印、用二號鈔票紙印刷、該項分幣券、已於昨（二十九日發行、茲將一分五分之幣劵正面、製版刊佈一分幣之正反面均係紅色、其反面之左面上角爲號碼、下爲圖章、四角爲一分西文字、右面爲一圓形一分銅幣反面模型、五分之正反面均印藍色、反面中爲一圓形五分鎳幣反面模型、四角爲五分西文字樣、中爲號碼、</p>
<h3>外幣續降</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况甚軟、蓋自王寵惠氏發表談話後、和平空氣因又濃、並以外匯一再步鬆、金市轉起回風、致人心更呈不安、賣氣頻盛、市價步趨下落、計英金鎊下落二元、金票降五角、美金鎊跌一元五角、金票小三角七分、香港票低一角、法郎票降一分半、新加坡票荷蘭票菲列濱票等各小二角、加拿大票落四角、日金票跌六厘、朝鮮票小五厘、且餘各幣尙穩、</p>
<h3>重要之物價</h3>
<p>九月六日重慶通信云、該處物價、亦因供求不稱、甚爲高昂、每人包飯月須十三四元、白米每斗（合兩市斗計）三元三四角、猪肉每斤五角、鷄每斤一元、菜油每斤七八角、其餘土產亦比前漲起二三倍、外來各貨、更無論已、香烟最貴、十支裝小匣大英牌每匣須五角左右、眞堪咋舌、</p>
<h3>證券　公債劇漲　一元二三角</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、突因王寵惠部長談話、和平空氣、　見濃原、金價因此下落、公債乃陡起漲風、在此謠言繁多之際、投機市塲、頓覺震動甚烈、空頭抵補、多頭加碼、一時蠭起、惟逢高賣出者、亦不乏人、更因開價太高、引起一部份多頭出籠、故旋見壓小數角、終以人氣激昂、低而復高、昨日上午、初開丙種即做六元、猛漲一元數角、陸續曾高至六元三角、當時買進者、以二十五號爲最踴躍、餘如聯益同裕以及零星散戶、吃胃均濃、永康則乘高賣出、散戶亦有脫手、後以市價回落數角、天生又乘低買進、復又回高三四角、午後形勢較爲穩定、多數續堅、二十五號仍有進胃、永康續有脫手、市價結果、計漲一元二角至一元三角半、成交總數約一百一二十萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中國銀行哎五十股、價爲五十二元正、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報吿云　昨日股市開盤時、堅挺異常、但入後獲利多頭紛紛出籠、價格轉疲、大半跌至前日水準、惟市塲　於獲利了結之股、吸收似猶易易、觀於各股價格稍有回第時、買方即羣起活動一點、可證此言之非虛、</p>
<p>倫敦二十八日電、今日遠東英商各公司股票掛脾行市、仍未全開、行情大體平穩、僅古拉客林傍橡皮股跌落六便士、爲十五先令九便士、</p>
<p>倫敦二十八日電、今日中國外債仍開中法美金等四種、掛牌行市平穩不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　十支粗紗　江浙天津需要仍旺　未受廿支下跌影響</h3>
<p>紗市依然、細挫粗漲、趨勢參差不一、人氣較為鬆弛、實緣市上盛傳和平空氣復起、證券上漲、於是對於棉紗做多之念、轉趨淡薄、同時華南需要大减、絕無動辦、但十支粗紗、北方天津帮及江浙兩處、皆有銷路、因此市態晚離二十支紗市之牽制、單獨前進、至於一十支棉紗情形、暫時恐無上升之望、就其最折之走勢、如再擯持、或有跌風發現、亦未可知也、查棉沙今有五件、運往香港</p>
<p>現紗晨開、仍屬遲滯、開盤多數意態、對於紗價平常、無意做多、兼之客帮交易不起、二十支雙馬棧價爲七百四十八元、雖勿動、然現貨紙見賣出、不見買進、少頃聞謠諑驟與、一跌十元、棧單爲七百三十五元、現貨價由七百八十元、跌至七十允、中途在四五元之間盤旋、收盤略好、查半日成交、統計一千八百八十五元、行情二十支雙馬跌十二元、天女跌五元、雙地球跌七元、惟十支紗尙漲五元、茲將各帮口買去之額、分列如左、內地　四八五　香港　一〇、五同行　一、一一五　天津　一五〇統計　一、八八五</p>
<h3>到頭不湧　通花漲四元許</h3>
<p>本棉交易依然發達、且市價逐步前進、但廠方除申新永安兩廠外、共他未見大景的採辦、然氣勢殊昂、良以各路到頭不湧、故市上存貨乾枯、因此售價鬆落無望也、十支粗紗原料更爲匱乏、且近來紗銷起色、廠家需要增進、故平果爾棉價比上日漲九元、通州花亦漲四元之譜，碼頭到白包花九百八十九包、茲將現棉悄形錄左、</p>
<p>通州花　一五六·〇〇　復成信進　六〇〇包　鈔票棧交</p>
<p>又　一五六·〇〇　一五七·〇〇　同泰進　三〇〇包　又</p>
<p>美種彭家浦　一八七·五〇　復成信進　二〇〇件　又</p>
<p>沙爾特　一八四·〇〇　復成信進　二〇〇件　又</p>
<p>墨籽　一五二·〇〇　申新二廠進　五〇〇包　鈔票送廠</p>
<p>一五〇號平果爾　一三〇·〇〇　永安廠進　二〇〇件　又</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨日近期匯兌轉鬆、然十月匯兌、始終未能放鬆、昨日市上交易踴躍、彭加浦售價爲一百八十餘元、惠司登價爲一百七十五元、近日因粗紗價漲、故平果爾售價殊爲俏俐、價在一百三十元左右云、據一般預料、棉價始終看漲也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初因南方套賣、市况殊形軟弱、下落五六磅音、後因同業購買而回漲、現貨交易亦轉活躍、結果收盤價格較上日略漲三五磅音、印度棉市殊爲靜寂、埃及跌十餘磅音、利物浦漲六磅音、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價復軟</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、降去一元至數角不等、公會劉盤、二四粗白現貨本棧五十五元、外棧五十四元半至五十五元、轉口貨仍四十二元、太古車白B嘜東棧五十八元八角、西棧五十九元、CW嘜五十八元半、CX嘜五十八元、DY嘜五十七元半、HX嘜五十七元、H嘜車赤四十三元半至四十三元二角、荷赤四十四元半、轉口三十七元、本棉白振記一號五十六元、二號五十五元半、三號五十五元、四號五十四元半、本一號冰六十六元半、晶明冰六十八元、據荷蘭電即裝粗白價微見回好、爲荷盾九·二五、</p>
<h3>糧食　日商猛拋客秈　行情銳落一元許　杜米缺貨續見挺</h3>
<p>杜米　河下無到、車輪包子續來三千餘包、本街銷塲轉遜、故早市初開、人心即疲、及後復遭日商大批蕪尖跌價傾銷、形勢愈頹、各客販乃亦不得不貶價求售、各尖遂一路下瀉、直至收市、未見回風、若各客尖結果降落一元左右、羊蘆尖貶小半元光景、獨各粳仍以缺貨、續挺四五角不等、計開特常粳四十一元半、中四十元三十九元半、特錫粳四十一元半、高四十一元至四十元、中三十九元、常州中粳三十九元半、蘇同崑粳三十九元、各地新粳均無到貨上市、蘇崑加楓新羊尖特二十六元、市二十五元半、中二十五元、蘆尖特二十六元一角、市二十五元半、江北尖二十三元至二十二元、蕪湖杜尖二十三元半、市二十三元、次廿二元半、砶尖二十二元至二十一元半、變元三十四五元、統計全市成交數五六千包、早晚稻河下及原包貨悉無市、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日跌風續熾、蕪湖秈到頭絡繹、江北南京各路亦有運到、而日商續有整批出樣、故粳米雖見步俏、客秈則再度趨落、行囤客戶亦有心虛求脫、因此蕪京江北各秈昨乃銳落一元左右、高秈開二十三元三四角、中决貨則自二十二元左右至二十一元不等云、</p>
<h3>麪粉客銷尚活　小麥到多呆滯</h3>
<p>麪粉　昨續穩定、南北帮均有染指、本街零批實銷亦不絕、連日天津香港厦門等處、存紛逐有裝去、市面扣緊、惟目下廠存充實、回籠貨又被廠家催收、與日廠拋包影響、囤戶不敢堅執、售價站於七元二三分至一角五分之間、統市成交五萬包、廠盤仍爲七元現鈔、兵船牌與砲車相差一角左右、麪粉今日有七千包運往香港、又麩皮三百三十包、亦運香港、</p>

<h3>日軍用車十一輛　昨晨在橫林傾覆　華游擊隊破壞路軌奏效　截取軍用品斃日兵卅餘　鎭澄公路新四軍重創日軍</h3>
<p>近來江浙淪陷區內華方游擊隊，益形活躍、日軍因抽調頻繁、僅能在各重要交通綫地帶，配駐部隊、以故距京滬滬杭兩綫稍遠之處、多成爲華方游隊雲集之所、加以各地民情激昂、協同動作、以致日軍疲於奔命、無法應付、即交通中心之京滬綫、亦已幾度爲華方游擊隊破壞、昨日清晨、京滬路橫林站又發生游擊隊截擊日軍兵車事、全車傾覆、日軍死傷近百、因此京滬路交通、頓告中斷、據悉此次華方游擊隊奇襲之情形、較歷次尤爲神速、茲將各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>華游擊隊　活躍愈甚</p>
<p>一月前、京滬路曾因被華方游擊隊毀去路軌、以致機車傾覆、乘客有多人負傷、駐守該處日軍、見游擊隊聲勢浩大、未敢與抗、嗣經修復路軌、恢復通車、然赴京旅客、已時有戒心矣、據悉京滬路沿綫近郊華方游擊隊、係江南義勇軍所部、具有相當實力、平時日軍除保護鐵路交通外、對游擊隊行動、殊乏餘力應付、近因南京鎭江一帶華方游擊隊活躍愈甚、日軍正籌接濟該處日軍軍用品、以應需要，</p>
<p>日軍用車　中途傾覆</p>
<p>前（二十八）晚、上海北站於戒備森嚴中、駛出日軍軍用車一列、計十一輛、滿載軍實、並派日兵隨車保護、計約一百名、荷槍實彈、擬駛往南京、詛料於前日深夜十二時許、該車駛經石塘灣洛社後、在橫林車站附近、突因該處路軌已有數十丈爲華方游擊隊破壞、而駐守該處之少數日軍、事先既因游擊隊行動敏捷、而未有覺察、及至該軍用車風馳電掣駛至該處、轟然一聲、全車傾覆、倒於路旁稻田內、</p>
<p>擊斃日軍　三十餘人</p>
<p>其時華方游擊隊即奮勇進擊、槍聲密如聯珠、車內日軍於覆車後、倉卒應戰、受創甚鉅、當塲死日軍三十餘人、餘均受傷、直至昨日淸晨一時許、槍聲始歸沉寂、華方游擊隊、旋即將該車內軍用品收拾而去、</p>
<p>京滬交通　全告斷絕</p>
<p>其時橫林車站因交通已被游擊隊破壞、故對鄰站洛社·戚墅堰、均無法通知、及至游擊隊引退、始得設法向外通知、無錫·常州·一帶、駐防日軍聞訊、已援救不及矣、路方乃於昨晨派工匠轉往橫林從事修復路軌、據悉昨日上午八時由滬駛京之快車及普通客車到達無錫後因不能前進、正在靜候路軌修復、再行上駛、至南京下行各車、昨日均未到滬、聞均止於常州、所有橫林段破壞路軌、迄至昨晚、聞尚未完全修復</p>
<p>鎭澄公路　亦報捷音</p>
<p>頃據常州來人談、新四軍爲紀念「九一八」八週紀念日、特下令所屬各部、於九月十五日至十七日爲總攻擊期、各部奉令後、均依照預定計劃、縝密佈置、分別出擊、該軍素著戰譽之×團一部、因諜報靈活、當即於十六日四時卅分、開赴鎭澄公路陳家橋附近一帶</p>
<p>四散埋伏</p>
<p>旋果有軍用卡車九輛、滿載日軍三百餘名、風馳雷掣而來、華軍待其接近射程、乃各從伏地躍出饗以猛密之手溜彈、與堅强之火力、同時並以障碍物斷其歸程、日軍猝不及防、且因車輛無法開駛、倉惶間死傷不下</p>
<p>二百餘人</p>
<p>後以華軍手留彈不繼、致被日軍逃去落後之卡車二輛、是役計擊毀日軍卡車七輛、奪獲重機關槍一挺輕機關槍二挺、水機關槍一挺、並「三八式」步槍五十餘枝、其他如軍旗·指揮刀·文件·輜重等亦甚夥、華軍引退後日軍即於當日下午前往</p>
<p>收拾死屍</p>
<p>計疊載三列車（卡車）而去、而華軍僅犧牲九名、傷三十餘名而已、該項傷兵、並即經當地民衆自動担架安全地帶療養、現人民往慰問者絡繹於途、</p>
<p>事後又悉</p>
<p>當此决戰鬥開始的一小時後、鄰近陳家橋之西夏墅與奔牛之日軍、聞訊即大批增援、惟因沿途均遭預伏之華軍攔擊、未達目的而潰、且聞駐西夏墅日軍之隊長、因而被擊斃、</p>
<h3>分幣券昨日發行　逐漸流通市面　由金融界及各機關前往兌領　昨日尚未全發今日繼續兌換　代價券限期自行收回</h3>
<p>中央銀行上海分行公吿、於昨日起發行分幣券、委託烟兌業同業公會轉發後、咋起已開始流通市面、發行辦法、悉照輔幣條例辦理、各業前發之臨時代價券、部令限期一律收回、各業零找困難問題、漸吿解決、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>昨晨發行　流通市面</p>
<p>中央銀行分幣券、係由美商永寗公司承印、首批五十萬元、計一分三十萬元、五分二十萬元、已於昨日發行流通市面、係以二號鈔票紙印製、其紙張及印刷成本頗貴、一分券正反面均爲紅色、正面左爲九層寳塔一座、右爲一分中華民國二十八年字樣、反面左上爲號碼、下蓋圖章、中為一分西文字樣、右爲圓形一分銅幣反面模型、五分券正反面均爲藍色、正面與一分券略同、反面中爲一圓形五分鎳幣反面模型、兩旁爲五分西文字樣、</p>
<p>市上行使　不折不扣</p>
<p>分幣券由承印之永寧公司解繳於中央銀行上海分行後、於昨晨八時、由該行開箱發行、烟兌業同業公會派章士彬·沈寅鶴·備款前往領取、同時各銀行錢莊直接派員向該行領取、至昨日下午六時截止、共發出一分券及五分券各十萬元、總共合國幣二十萬元、是項分布券、按照票面十足發行、市上行使不折不扣、當發行之初、嚴禁抬高價格、又中央銀行並不另設兌換　、望各界除行莊外、切勿向該行直接請求兌換、</p>
<p>分幣券之　授受數目</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向中央銀行上海分行探悉、分幣券之發行、悉照輔幣條例辦理、係以法幣爲十足之準備、其授受數目、依照輔幣條例第五條規定、「鎳幣每次授受、以合法幣二十元爲限、銅幣每次授受、收受及中央銀行之兌換、不適用此種限制、凡集滿五分券二十張或一分券一百張、得向中央銀行兌換法幣一元、首批五十萬元、完全在上海發行、至於第二决印發、决視市面需耍再行決定、</p>
<p>中行昨辦　銀錢兌換</p>
<p>昨據該行發言人語大光社記者、本行發行之新券手續、均遵照部令辦法及總行指示情形代爲辦理、本日（卽昨日）本行所辦理之兌換事宜、均係全埠之各銀行錢莊方面、决之則爲海關、郵局、儲匯局兩租界工部局等、所有請兌換數額、悉視該行莊等適可之需要而供給之、並不依其所請之數即予兌換之便利、關於限制兌換數額步驟、早經曉論該各辦事人員、不必明文規定、</p>
<p>各代價券　責令收回關於上海各公司行號以前爲應付零幣缺乏、臨時所發行之代價券、市面流通爲數頗鉅、聞財政部已責令各發行之行號限期自行收回、以重國家整個幣制、至於以前代替零我之郵票、除已由上海市商會呈部予以設法補救外、郵政管理局已通令各郵君通融收受、昨日起、因分幣券已發行、於是各業代價券除木號發行者收回外、一律拒絕收受他號代價券、至電車公司之代幣券、聞公司方面、決中止再行增發、</p>
<p>烟兌公會　轉發使用</p>
<p>烟兌業同業公會、昨晨向中央銀行領得分幣券後、即於上午九時在寗波路四百八十七號該會轉發各會員烟兌店、並在門首公吿「分幣券今日暫歸協洽同業掉換、」掉換者甚爲擁擠、烟兌業市塲昨日臨時暫行停市、昨日上下午僅烟兌業共向中央銀行領得分幣券六萬元、完全轉發給各會員烟兌店、定今日再向中央銀行具領、繼續辦理轉發事宜、據悉該會同業全市的有三千餘家、協洽有二百餘家、各菸公司又有百餘家、共計有三千三百餘家、昨領換之數、實不敷分配、</p>
<p>單位市民　不允兌換</p>
<p>中央銀行以足敷目前全埠各業之正當需要、對於新劵分發手續、至爲愼重、除各銀行錢莊各大公司洋行電車汽車公司等方面、允予供給新券外、其餘如單位市民欲向該行兌換者、均將拒絕、其原因以新券一經流通市面、隨時可轉入民間、往來使用、零找即不困難、該行當局今後是吾擬增發新券、須視市面之需要如何、然後再行決定、</p>
<p>昨日市上　零找情形</p>
<p>昨有一部份不肖烟兌同業、乘機牟利、對是頃分幣之出兌、每輔幣一角、祇能換取新分幣券九分、甚至祇能換八分者、否則即拒絕換與、因上項情形、故居民對是項分幣之獲得、甚爲困難、電車及公共汽車以及大新先施新新等各公司之代價券、就昨日情形、並不爲民衆所拒用、因其仍適於實際需要也、至其他商店印行之各種代價劵、大都已通知限期收回、故是項雜券、在市上顯然已遂漸絕跡、</p>
<h3>金長到期本息　今日開始付款　分爲六期每期一個月　以上海通用滙劃給付</h3>
<p>關稅擔保統一復興金長各內債、自財政部因關稅被截暫停還本付息後、由國債基金委員會商得中中交農四行同意、由四行貼現付款、新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、民國十七年金融長期公債、第十二次到期本息、計本一百十二萬五千元、息四十萬零七千八百十二元五角、本息共計一百五十三萬二千八百十二元五角、準九月三十日（卽今日）起、由中央銀行及其委託之中國交通兩銀行付款、上海則分六期、每期爲一個月付淸之、並以上海通用之滙劃付給之、</p>
<h3>金銀進出口統計　均爲出超</h3>
<p>一月至八月　體系關發表額海關發表金銀進出口統計、（一）今年八月份金進口自英國至上海一六八金、出口由福州往香港四四·五六五金、銀出口由福州往香港一〇·一六六元、進口無、（二）今年一月至八月、金進口三七二金、出口一·三六九·四五二金、銀進口八二四元、出口一·丸〇一·五八九元、計金出超一·三六九·一一六金、銀出超一·九〇〇·七六五元、</p>
<h3>煤氣增收附加費　工部局已通過　附加費增至百分之八十　但局方得隨時重行考量</h3>
<p>上海自來火公司、最近曾請工部局准其提高現在所收之煤氣附加費（百分之二十三）俾能增加收入、以抵償因外滙緊縮而添增之營業費用、該公司陳請書、連同以英金三便士又四分之三合國幣一元爲根據而修訂之收支概算表、業經工部局公用事業委員會於本月十八日提出考量、</p>
<p>兩度呈請　均經駁回</p>
<p>查該公司會於本年五月間及七月間、兩度呈請工部局准其加價、均經該局駁斥、此次所請一節、復經工部局財務處長審查、該處長認爲自來火公司從前所訂以六便士半之滙價爲根據之預算表、勢須因近來滙價暴跌而大加修改、該公司最近提出之修正預算書中、雖有若干處、不無可以改動之餘地、</p>
<p>彌補損失　勢須增加</p>
<p>但附加費仍有增加之必要、以資彌補營業費用之損失、該公司所用煤、、均照外幣付値、其他各種費用、亦因外滙而大受影響、因此該處長擬請局方准自來火公司在結至本年十一月一日爲止、或同日以後之賬單上、加開附加費百分之八十、此項附加費應於明年四月底以前、隨時由工部局視該公司之營業狀况、重行考量、上述建議、業經工部局董事會通過、</p>
<h3>中央救火會　授將典禮</h3>
<p>字林報云、河南路中央救火會頃舉行授獎典禮、工部局總董樊克令以英國消防隊聯合會頒發之十年以上長期服務獎章頒贈消防隊外籍人員八人及工部局所贈至少服務十二年之獎章頒贈救火會義勇後備隊外籍人員四人、樊克令首致簡詞、盛讚消防隊與義勇隊在平時、允其爲在前年戰爭期內之服務、繼由救火會主任李列答謝、頒獎禮畢、救火會俱樂部舉行招待會、樊克令與救火會要員均與會、法租界救火會、亦派代表到會、</p>

<h3>滬西情勢混沌　工部局力謀解決　連日與日僞市府進行商談　尋求可以妥善解決途徑　僞市府已通知外僑徵收房捐</h3>
<p>居住滬西越界築路之外僑、昨日亦已有僞「市府財政局」收稅員登門通知、自下月起、房捐應交由僞「財政局」收取、據悉僞「市府」此舉、係因「維新政府」取消每月四十五萬元協款所致、以財政支絀、遂力圖開闢此種新「稅」源、以爲彌補、</p>
<p>外僑居戶　感受威脅</p>
<p>昨（廿九）日越界築路區域、偽警數量、益見增多、故外僑居戶、亦已感受極度之緊張，工部局某高級職員、昨日下午向記者發表談話、亦已承認越界道路上稅收問題、業有極大之困難存在、惟工部局正竭力設法、以求儘速解決此種因難、</p>
<p>雙方交涉　繼續商談</p>
<p>又據記者所得未能完全證實之消息、謂工部局代表與僞市府、對越界築路交涉、已連日進行商談、兾能覓得一可以採用之方案、在會議中、曾有如是建議、雙方協定工部局對於愚園路及該路上之全部里弄、有完全之管轄權、至滬西之其他區域、則讓與偽警巡選隊、</p>
<p>滬西居民　紛紛遷移</p>
<p>滬西越界築路、自僞警侵入布崗以來、居民惴惴不安、多謀遷移、加以僞「市府」通知該區住戶將自下季起、微收房捐、更爲恐慌、搬塲之風、盛極一時、一般房客終日傢具箱籠等物件、源源集運、來往行人、駐足而視、莫不感慨系之、</p>
<p>公然携帶　重機關槍</p>
<p>至僞警行動、依然猖獗、昨日上午，竟有僞警一隊、公然携帶機關槍一架在越界築路上梭巡、而交通崗位、自遭僞警侵佔擅行管理以來、行駛越界築路之車輛、深感困難、緣僞警對於管理交通技能、極不熟練、常顧此失彼、使駕車者無所適從、是以尙有幾處衝要地點、如億定盤路愚園路口及億定盤路大西路口均裝有紅綠交通燈、至今仍由巡捕管理、僞警則在傍呆立而已、</p>
<p>賭窟商店　相繼停業</p>
<p>曹家渡方面、近來會不斷發生暴行事件、加以搶刦之風甚盛、非特居民危懼、即一般大賭客、亦均具戒心、故日來該處一部份賭台烟窟、以營業衰落、巳相繼停業、至商號方面、亦以無利可圖、自願廉價讓頂者、比比皆是、該處本有意軍前往巡邏、自「九一八」後、久已不見踪跡矣、</p>
<p>日軍用車　無故開槍</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、公共租界警務處西捕頭薩特　與見習西捕頭艾萊今（二十九日）晨一時左右、自靜安寺路捕房乘馬達自行車巡邏至靜安寺華記路附近、距維也納花園不遠處、適於日本軍用汽車一輛駛過時、突聞砰然一聲、兩氏先尙以爲人力車胎爆破、惟旋在地上檢獲空彈壳一顆、據人力車夫與行人二三人之意見、該彈係日軍汽車發出、此事刻正調查中、衆認開槍者或係該日軍汽車中之酒醉士兵一隊、惟發彈之方向、則無踨跡、</p>
<h3>湘桂鐵路　已展築至柳州　約本月底即可通車　鎭南關至南寗將通</h3>
<p>湘桂鐵路通車、巳展至永福、曾誌本報、茲悉由永福至柳州一段、巳舖軌完竣、本月底即可通車、又鎮南關至南寗段、現亦在舖築中、的十一月可以通車、柳州至南寗段、平土工程、雖尙未完竣、但正在積極進行中、通車當亦不遠、一俟全段通車、則湘桂交通、當可暢通無阻、客貨運輸、自便利不少、</p>
<h3>强迫注射防疫針　居民備遭虐待　北河南路防務仍維現狀　天后宮內僞警並無武裝</h3>
<p>蘇州河北中區、自北江西路至北河南路區域、英日防綫變更後、日方即强迫當地居民注射防疫針、茲以限期迫促、故注射羣衆益形擁擠、茲分述各情如左、</p>
<p>强迫注射　限期截止</p>
<p>北江西路海寗路上海電力公司門前帆布篷帳F注射處、自日方於本月一十二日接防後、即開始强迫常地居民注射防疫針以來該篷帳四週、均擠滿待注射之羣眾、茲以日方官佈是項注射於本月底截止、屆時未領有防疫症證明書者、即拒絕其居住於該區域以內、綠是昨晨圍繞篷帳四週待注射之居民益衆，秩序極爲凌亂、在塲彈壓之日兵及「大道警察」、乃不時以籐鞭及木棍向相、</p>
<p>易防區域　情形靜止</p>
<p>靶子路北江西路江蘇汽車行內、以前英軍駐紮處、自被日方加佈鐵絲網予以堵塞後、迄未有日兵淮據、靶子路西端織路醫院、日方雖一度前往附設於內之慈聯分會難民第十九收容所職員調查、惟迄亦未有日兵淮駐、北河南路日方除在東邊各橫馬路豎立界牌外、該路內防務仍由英防軍守衛、匯司捕房警務人員亦照常上差巡邏、與昔日並無異狀、</p>
<p>僞警二名　並無武裝</p>
<p>北蘇州路天后宮橋現上海市商會內之僞警、自被英防軍所逐退後、前日上午改由僞警數名駐守、前日午後、是輩武裝僞警復又進入、第當大通社記者昨日赴該處巡視時、則市商會大門進口處仍駐僞警一名、稍進『通行證塡發處』、亦駐有一名、共計兩名、惟若輩僞警、均被解除武裝、徒手人內、</p>
<h3>僞局誘葡輪登記　又成泡影</h3>
<p>僞「維新政府交通」前爲企圖攫取航輪管理權統制外輪航運起見、經於本年四月間在滬成立「航政局」、設局址於虹口北四川路五十五號、並訂定航輪登記規則、通吿各航商於五月底前、須向該「局」登記、並以逾期即予禁止航行或取消船怕所有權相威嚇、旋以各航商一律不加置理、父將登記展至六月底截止、但屆期仍無人問津、昨據大光社記者向航業界探悉、該「局」各僞員以終日無事可辦、情極無聊、最近又復百般設法誘惑被扣各葡輸、揚言前往登記後、即可獲得日方釋放、照常航行、但葡商意志堅决、始終本外交方式、向日方交涉、故該項企圖、終成泡影、</p>
<h3>英僑聯合會　募基金充戰時用途　將由英人團體委員會　負責管理並主持其事</h3>
<p>字林報二、英僑聯合會總委員會星期二日舉行月會、曾討論設立基金、充戰時工作與救濟用途之建議、一般意見、均以爲此種基余、較發出若干不同的呼籲、更爲有效、建議中之基金、將由代表英僑聯合會·英國婦女公會·英商會·及其他英人協會之委員會管理之、月會席上並報吿由上海和明商會主持之租金調整委員會、今已成立、英僑聯合會已接各種租金糾紛之報吿、今交租金調整委員會辦理、</p>
<h3>運滬砂石　又被扣留</h3>
<p>泗礁砂石、自被「江南公司」壟斷、祗允三分之一歸滬商行承銷後、該業內部即起糾紛、一部行家及船戶、因生計壓迫、不能長此延宕、故願忍痛犧牲允許此三分之一行銷權、而一部同業反對此議、故相峙數月、尙無具體辦法、該業主席處孝祚、以時値非常、若不再行解決、必致同婦於盡、乃出任調停、一方與「江南公司」交涉中、在條的未簽訂前、在滬暫設營業所、將所派得三分之一砂石、由各行商分攤營業、詎料前日由泗礁等處運滬之砂石八十餘船、祇有十餘船進口、其餘近七十船、統被江南公司扣留在吳淞口外，該業公會認爲此次進口之砂石尙不敷三分之一、故均拒絕卸貨、一方再與「江南公司」涉、請其釋放應得之砂石船、</p>
<h3>棉花起岸被阻　日將續施壓力　侵佔區棉花悉被統制　運出之棉均須裝日輪　本市棉布內銷日逹三四萬疋</h3>
<p>大陸報云、關於近傳日方禁止棉花在上海各碼頭起岸事、記者頃訪本市某主要棉商、據談、日方施加壓力、以圖壟斷整個棉市之結果、產棉區中植棉之華人、現遇巨大困難、估計自上週杪起、上海日當局扣留自侵佔區運來之棉花、巳逾二千包、</p>
<p>上海棉價</p>
<p>雖已臻每市包一百六十元之鉅、惟植棉者被迫出售、每句所得實不足六十元云、本市棉業界一般均料日方將續施壓九、蓋聞日當局已電侵佔區內之經手人、至少目前停正一切棉花運滬也、聞日當局之訓電中稱、所有運出之棉、均須裝日輪、不得先灣上海、而</p>

<h3>談文章與會</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>信心是成功的礎石。這句話我們知道，而且我們也都用來應付這一次的狂風暴雨。我們眼看到有許多充滿憤怒和仇恨的作品印在一本本的書籍上雜誌上。那些都是紀錄下人生創疤的，這裏面有我們的眼淚，有我們的悲號，我們的詛咒，也還有許多進一步的積極的意義。但是我總奇怪，我覺得還不够；樂觀的濃厚的氣氛總有點欠缺。</p>
<p>樂觀的筆調一向很難寫，也最難討好。才子佳人的小說一落團圓便不免俗套了。似乎悲苦愈深刻則愈動人。大家爲省力討好起見，揀那些灰黯的寫，寫殘酷，寫屠殺，寫家破人亡，寫一切不人道的事態。我們看見得很多了。果眞是實感的話，怵目驚心的讀者，淌眼淚的事儘有。這效果誰也不吾認：牠能剌激讀者，呌他們刻骨銘心，記牢仇恨，湔雪恥辱。可是我們也別忘記，偉大的成功，有兩個要件，一是決念前的刺激，一是工作進行中的策勵。說明恥辱和仇恨，這祇是一種刺激，增加自己的決心，但我們旣已下了決心，工作亦已進行，迢時我們決不僅是痛定思痛，我們須耍鼓勵，信心和愉快。無味的驕矜，一個人往往變得鬆弛和疎懈，但一味的愁眉苦臉，也容易蝕傷精力。勞作之餘的消遺和光明在望的歡欣，我們都需要，而且我們也適宜。</p>
<p>一羣人走上艱苦的路，義無返顧，信心是事實。走下兩年來，整夜在黑暗中摸索。天也快亮了，走不走自然不成問題的。走直走下去！這不必再說什麼你該走的。即使對不知的人說說也不妨，然而在黑夜中深谷內，看見陽光透進石縫來，你何不更狂笑，高歌，讓幸福的空氣驅散黑夜的寒冷。</p>
<p>信心，勇敢，蓬勃，堅實，愉快，這種種都說明一種興會。疲勞時是一帖興奮劑，滲入人體內牠有健補的功能。這決不僅是浮誇和吶喊，在判斷上是樂觀，在物質是充實，在時問上是不朽，在空間上是遼闊。綜合起來，這便都是興會。</p>
<p>刺激在初期固然需要，然而在目前刺激斷然還不够，悲憤之外，尤須與會策勵。這所謂與會，尤超過光明的揭示或勝利的題材而上之。分析起來，牠便是作者先有正確的樂觀意識，而後油然萌起一種潛力和愉快的心靈，經過意像傅寫下來的氣氛。這氣氛雖然與題材常相表裏，但實際上牠給人家的策勵，往往尤甚於樂觀的題材。牠是無言，牠是作者心靈的愉快波動，牠能使讀者喜，慰，勉勵，有力。從某章某節上你尋不着牠的影子。這是作者的心情。表面牠常寄託在故事中，實在故事背後，分明你還看得見一個作者，勇敢，蓬勃，堅實，愉快，有</p>
<p>即使不因目前的鼓勵，中國一十年來新文藝，在一向黏住了夢魘和呻吟之下，也極需要這一種提倡。把握住創作的興會，展開勝利，愉快，健康的心境，策勵讀者以外，也好給他們引領到柳暗花明的境界裏去。這不算發吉兆，這祇是你一種興會。你該有的是生命的力量。悲憤之餘，這種力量一日也不能缺少。</p>
<h3>平糶　（上）</h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>他慢吞吞的拖着他們特有的厚底皮靴，跟上另外五個穿着同樣制服的人，去執行維持秩序的職務。</p>
<p>秋風在街頭盤旋，靜靜地。抬起頭：還不曾亮透的灰的天，　　的雲。他沈重地抽一口氣，却驀的對頭就是一陣雨，寒顫顫的要嘔吐，好容易强着作整步走才忍住了。他想：娘也難怪，七十齊頭，天天咬麵，自然受不住。自己也知道這麵乾了下，硬翹翹：濕的呢，滑膩膩又帶甜，住在南邊的二三回好吃，七天八天就要梗喉嚨。祇怨自己整月進三十幾塊法幣，還得老少養兩雙半。老娘是明白的；誰害了我們？目前時勢更艱，她祇好忍着，却一天天更瘦了；小毛要再撅嘴，乾脆二十個巴掌，讓這小×哭個死去活來；祇是難個大小鬼却口口聲聲「婆婆受不了」，這回還帶個籃子說要糴平米。媽媽的，這賊骨準踩死，還是老子拳頭晦氣；剛才不是給他紮了一頓，他早要穿着衣服跟我跑了……他邊想邊走，連雨顆開始滴在頭上也漠然。繼而前面小張們喊，他才神經質地跟了上去。</p>
<p>「十五歲的小鬼擠上五六個　頭不要死嗎？」他自言自語地。</p>
<p>「老周！又是叫你大毛去買××牌和××牌麵粉罷？—便宜些？他可是又不肯？」小張們笑了。</p>
<p>他惱着對他們暗咒：「你們都是我底末代，反正又要來這麼個老調：這是劣貨，南火車姑的炸彈沒把你險些？——我兒子也這樣說着我。哼！」他呆望着他們，陡的一陣懸，方想到起身爲省用五分電車票，就多吃些半饙的麵餘才出來上差的。他强自鎭定，把勾在臂上的兩衣向胸口摩糜，却不睬他們，管自走着。</p>
<p>走了一回，小張突然拍手拍脚嚷起來了：「你瞧，才怪！天空還有星，街上就串起洋澄蟹來了。乖乖！一他們一齊望過去，果然連轉角上人家洋房的牆上都坐滿了人，有的居然還撑着傘。</p>
<p>他們本能地吼了過去，嗁得他們趕緊跌下來，幾個米袋也給跌在人家花園中去了，他們逃呀地向東街上轟。</p>
<p>張勤貴第一個喊：「猪玀！」</p>
<p>「猪玀！你們要吃米飯性命可不要嗎？你們看會館門還關着！」鐵門真的還靜靜地闔着，人却在門前愈聚愈多。六個巡捕趕緊軋進去維持秩序。</p>
<p>他們飛揮着警棍，一堆人好容易被擠成一長串臘腸。小張靈快，就把繩向一邊聞了起來，攔出一條狹道，讓他們一個挨一個好候着。三百尺繩太短，人們　挨到靠南的××路，沿××路又排到××路，再繞過××路，盡頭，才准後來的一個個參加進去！</p>
<p>天哭喪臉，濛濛然下起牛毛雨；一陣冷風，牛毛雨又轉成大雨顆倒着。柏油路上浮起薄霧，濺着，淌着。一長列縮着　貼在鐵鬥前，短牆下，甚至露天用袋眾頭伏在人行道上</p>
<p>洪流冲激在路中，陽溝淙淙奏出鐵馬交鳴的音樂。有些孩子把包米的報紙摺成無常帽往頭上套，濕紙糊上臉製成了一種可怕的臉譜；雨却更無情地從他們底顎下流到頸中，混和着汗水竄過衫裏一直淌往脚背。</p>
<h3>畢業刊</h3>
<p>— 舒尼</p>
<p>當我把頭從書桌上抬起來，巡視一下屋子四周的時候，我又看見了這本厚厚的畢業刋。放下筆，我感動了；有一種無可奈何的悲哀。這是自己曾經花過勞力的工作啊！</p>
<p>多少個夜晚，我趕寫着稿子，與朋友校對着一堆堆的樣稿。直到眼皮重得像塊鉛時才住手。接着一陣呵欠，我們都輕鬆的笑了。工作完畢後的愉快。</p>
<p>如今，錯字還是那麼多呢。我有說不出的難堪。美德是艱苦而又極易失敗的學習，認眞是頂難的。不知怎的，這兩天我老想到繡花枕頭。</p>
<p>於是，打開了書。我看見華麗的校門，莊嚴的禮堂，摩登的體靑館……隨着悠悠的歲月之流漂去了的往事，又浮現出來。然而，我不想在回憶中苦惱自己。積蓄着內心的憤怒吧，充滿了火藥的炸彈，在某一秒鐘內總要爆裂的。</p>
<p>舒適的生活，詩一樣美麗的日子，都跟着紅紅的火熖毀滅了。但，我們將如何在廢墟上重建起新的樂園來呢？可憐的人呵，竟忘記了嗎？什麼風沙迷了眼？</p>
<p>一頁頁的翻下去，我怔住了。映在眼簾裹的是夾在黑綫條中的照片，是紀念兩位亡故了的同學。先前，我和他們都很生疏，甚至沒有交談過，可是現在，我却怔住了。從搖籃到墳墓，竟是這麼短促？對於死我毫無畏懼，但，我更熱愛活。「活着總歸是可讚美的，因爲可以工作。」我要做的事眞太多了。</p>
<p>我端詳着每一張熟悉的面孔，記起了橫在這一代人面前的多歧的路。茫茫旅程，年靑的伙伴，咱們將何去何從？</p>

<h3>葬禮</h3>
<p>— C．Wolfe著　品品譯</p>
<p>沒有一聲軍鼓，更沒有哀奏，</p>
<p>我們把他的遺骸移至城邊；</p>
<p>沒有一個士兵，爲了追悼，</p>
<p>在我們挖掘的英雄墓上鳴槍。</p>
<p>我們在死寂的夜色昏昏中舉葬，</p>
<p>我們以槍刺掘開泥土；</p>
<p>月亮發出顫顫的幽光，</p>
<p>油燈幽黯地在發着亮。</p>
<p>用不到棺木安殮他，</p>
<p>我們也不以衾衣殉葬他；</p>
<p>但是他正像戰士一樣長眠，</p>
<p>軍服裏看他的遺體。</p>
<p>我們念着短短的誄詞，</p>
<p>不提起一句悲傷的話，</p>
<p>我們凝視着他的面容，</p>
<p>艱苦地想明天。</p>
<p>一齊掘着狹小的墳床，</p>
<p>輕輕放下他孤獨的棺槨，</p>
<p>敵人與生客會踐踏這墳頭啊，</p>
<p>而我們將遠去海上！</p>
<p>他們將誣蔑他已死的靈魂，</p>
<p>辱駡他已冷的骨灰，</p>
<p>但是不要緊，只耍讓他睡在</p>
<p>一個國人爲他掘的墳裏就够。</p>
<p>我們的大功未竟，</p>
<p>目前的任務已吿完畢；</p>
<p>遠處斷續的槍聲，</p>
<p>想是敵人在無聊地發洩吧。</p>
<p>緩慢而深沉地我們埋了他，</p>
<p>在以他血肉求來的美土中；</p>
<p>我們不鐫一行銘文，也未豎一塊石碑！</p>
<p>我們離去只敎光榮伴着他。</p>

<p>（按上兩片在目前這個情况中，正是我們最需要的。）</p>
<p>大上海映「比翼雙飛」（Sweet　hearts）米高梅出品係全部五彩片，由著名的歌唱明星珍妮麥唐納與奈爾遜埃弟聯合演出，此片前曾在南京大戲院加價上映，乃是一張極臻完美的音樂美術片；如果我們說上面兩張片子是硬性的話，那未，這一張片子應該算是軟性的了。</p>
<p>國泰的雙十節片子，現在尙未決定，猜想起來，大概總是在「三壯士」（Frois　deSt　Cyr.與「鐵馬」（UnionParific）兩片中任擇其一。按第一片乃由琪茂坎通，勞倫托丹，琪希佛來主演，劇情是紀述法國陸軍的英勇戰蹟，至於「鐵馬」呢，乃由白蓓蘭史丹薇與佐麥克利合演，塲　相當偉大，劇情也相當緊凑。</p>
<p>總之，上面這幾張片子，都是有一看的價値的。順便再在這裏說一句話，南京的「四羽毛」以前已經拍過默片，當時在演出的時候，這張片子已經是得到過非常的成功了。</p>

<p>改良平劇</p>
<h3>金素琴女士自述：　演劇十四年（下）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆録</p>
<p>—及致力改良平劇之旨趣</p>
<p>改艮平劇這工作，是我所認爲最有意義而又最感興趣的事。戲劇在文化部門中原居重要地位當然也得跟着時代前進；平劇雖是一種舊的藝術，但在劇本方面，最低限度就如「舊瓶裝新酒」的辦法，來滲以時代意識，多加改良是極可能而很必要的。前次，我和歐陽先生合作，在他担任編導工作之下，先後演過了「漁夫恨」「梁紅玉」「桃花編」「楊貴妃」新玉堂春」等五個劇目。大概的經過情形：演出方面，劇本多其新意識，塲子因亦略有改動，演員於唱做外，兼重劇中人個性的認識與表情，關於舞台面的立體，佈景和新式燈光，亦極考究重視。組織方面。：演員事先悉經訓練，排戲實行導演制，前台檢塲人一律免除不用，後台分設總務，劇務，演出，服裝，道具各部，一切規律化的重在保守秩序。這番雖屬初度的嘗試，演期亦祗兩月工夫，但總很熱烈的希望有機會能在這路綫上繼續努力進取。</p>
<p>拍演電影</p>
<p>去年冬天，藝華公司邀我拍演電影，演了一部「楚霸王」古裝片。本來，我對電影極感興趣，早想拍部片子，作一嘗試。但在演過「楚霸王」以後，覺得這工作委實幹不了，太苦。彼時因爲時値嚴冬，攝影塲冷冰冰的澈夜工作，眞是凍得要命。又兼每晚在「黃金」演戲，時間與精神都不够應付；我的鏡頭因此刪去不少，便吿匆匆結束。自己對於這片子實在不滿意。以後希望能有充分的時間與有義意的劇本，拍部好一點的片子。</p>
<p>一般感想</p>
<p>我以爲演平劇須有眞實工夫，否則決難唱好；便演改良平劇，也非有此切實根底不可。關於改良工作最感困難的問題是缺乏編劇人才，劇本極感恐慌。因爲編劇人於平劇方面旣得深具經騐，又須思想新颕擅長文學才好；要不然劇本寫得雖好，未合於舞臺表演；而適合於上演的劇本，時代的認識也會嫌得不够。這確不是一件輕易的工作。另一觀感：純粹的平劇不妨仍由平角兒保守下去。南方的平劇則予儘可能的造成半唱半做的改良劇—但絕不是機關佈景戲。我們舊劇界中思想轉換，能够自編劇本與同情改良工作的同志們，現在已是很多了，要能大家努力起來，我相信這改良平劇是定可獲得最大的成功。</p>

<p>光陰過得眞快，眼睛一霎，又屆中秋了。這一個星期之間的我，可稱忙極，瞧了宋德珠的小放牛，又忙着聽趙余蓉吳素秋梁韻秋等的四五花洞，再加着東家應酬，西家宴會，連平素喜愛的舞塲，簡直都沒工夫（四三）去，本星期日大都會舉行慈善茶舞會聽說還有些游藝節目，像金莉莉梅豔雲應梅華等都要歌唱平劇，莉莉既認識了我這虛名老師，自然要托我找個吊嗓子的琴師了，昨天我替他約好了一位，不免就要到大都會給個信，到舞場去找舞女說話，倘若跑到她位子邊去說，似乎不大雅相，不免同她跳一只舞，當我們止在且說且走的當兒，忽然又聽得出谷黃鶯般的聲音在呌着師父。回頭一看，却是宓令正伴着一位歡喜佛似的客人在跳舞呢一這客人看見我也笑了並且亦嚶嚀地呌着師父，倒呌我先笑起來了，真個是「却之下恭，受之無愧」呌我怎麼回答呢？宓令有女詩人的雅號，淸雅秀麗，舉止端荘，標準舞更跳得極好，她的詩文，我雖然未曾屬目，然於其談吐之間，巳可決其非庸俗之輩，我呢：根本就不會做詩，怎能做詩人的師父呢，至於這位類似歡喜佛的徒弟那就格外不了敢當了。</p>
<p>宓字看密，一音伏，戲謂宓令曰：尊姓要讀作宓（茯），倒是一味上好的藥品「茯苓」尊姓要讀作宓（密）軍事期間的「密令」是再重要不過了。無怪你要紅得不可開交，忙得不亦樂乎，並且連累着兩位眼鏡先生，一位歡喜佛也大起忙頭，這也是你的魔力啊！</p>
<p>講到學做詩文，我以爲大可不必，自古詩人都窮愁潦倒，多才美貌的少女，往往紅顏薄命，這是我的迷信，再說詩賦一類東西，不過陶冶性情，根本就沒有什麼實用，讀書要求明理，就是說我們應當知道怎樣做人不過在閒暇的時候看看詩文，總是好的，但應注意，不要過於勞神才好。</p>

<h3>German-Soviet Pact Divides Eastern European Sphere of Influence and Issues Declaration Calling for Britain and France to Ceasefire, Britain and France Refuse and Resolve to Fight to the End, Soviet Union and Estonia Sign "Mutual Assistance Treaty"</h3>
<p>Moscow. Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov and Estonian Foreign Minister Selter engaged in negotiations for the conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty and a commercial agreement between the two countries. These negotiations lasted for five days from September 24th and were successfully completed yesterday. All mutual assistance treaties and commercial agreements have been signed, and Stalin also participated in the matter. (TASS dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Moscow. The mutual assistance treaty signed between Estonia and the Soviet Union allows the Soviet Union to establish naval bases and several airfields within Estonian territory, as well as the right to station troops. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Moscow. Chairman of the Soviet Council of People's Commissars and Foreign Commissar Molotov and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop conducted negotiations on the conclusion of the German-Soviet friendship and demarcation treaty on September 27th and 28th. Stalin and Soviet Ambassador to Germany Merekalov participated on the Soviet side, and German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg participated on the German side. As a result, both sides signed the German-Soviet friendship and demarcation treaty. In addition, the two governments jointly issued a declaration. Molotov and Ribbentrop also exchanged letters on economic issues. (TASS dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Moscow. The governments of the Soviet Union and Germany issued a declaration today stating, "After the governments of the Soviet Union and Germany signed a treaty today, they have thoroughly resolved the issues arising from the collapse of Poland, thereby establishing a firm foundation for lasting peace in Eastern Europe. The two governments therefore agree to express the opinion that resolving the current war between Germany and Britain and France is in the interests of all countries. Therefore, the two governments will work together in the future, and if necessary, cooperate with other friendly countries to find ways to achieve the above objectives in the shortest possible time. If this effort by the two governments still proves ineffective, this will prove that Britain and France should bear the responsibility for the continuation of the war, and if the war continues, the Soviet and German governments will consult each other on the necessary steps." The Soviet government authorized Molotov and the German government authorized Ribbentrop to sign. (TASS dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Moscow. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop boarded a plane at 12:40 noon today and returned to his country. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>London. According to reliable sources here today, the British government will definitely reject the joint peace proposal of the Soviet Union and Germany, and will reiterate its intention to continue the war until the war's objectives are achieved and Hitlerism collapses. (Associated Press dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>London. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that although there has been no reaction from officials to the new German-Soviet demarcation agreement, well-informed sources have stated their views as follows: Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in a recent speech that the actions of the Soviet Union do not affect the determination of Britain and France to fight until their goals are achieved. Although the German-Soviet agreement takes into account the continuation of the war, it only stipulates consultation between Germany and the Soviet Union, in other words, Germany must continue to make concessions in exchange for Soviet military assistance. The British government will immediately consult with France on the attitude to be adopted towards the German-Soviet agreement. As for the relationship between the Soviet Union and Estonia, it is just another sign of Stalin emulating Hitler's tactics. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>London. Regarding the recent developments in Moscow, although officials here have not made any formal statements, well-informed sources have said that Britain's only answer to Germany's peace offensive is "no." The war objectives of all democratic countries were thoroughly outlined by Prime Minister Chamberlain on the 17th of this month to eradicate the system of violence in Europe. Based on this, although Germany has achieved success in Poland in collusion with the Soviet Union, the issue for which Britain and France are fighting has not been eliminated. On the contrary, the goals of Britain and France have become even clearer, and there is no doubt that they will fight to the end to achieve final victory. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>London. According to sources here, Britain and France are consulting with each other today on the German-Soviet peace proposal, and the British Cabinet is also holding a meeting to discuss it. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Paris. Well-informed French sources have stated that although Germany and the Soviet Union have signed an agreement, France is still determined to fight. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Vatican City. The Holy See denied today the German claim that the Holy See is currently cooperating with Britain and France in a peace movement. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Tells Britain It Will Remain Neutral and Is Willing to Conduct Business Negotiations</h3>
<p>London. Soviet sources here recently announced that the Soviet Union is willing to discuss various business issues with Britain. Ambassador Maisky is now awaiting proposals from the British government and hopes that Britain will treat the Soviet Union with a "friendly" attitude. British political figures commented that the Soviet Union's intention is probably that the British government should send a business delegation, led by a senior official such as Commerce Minister Stanley, to Moscow for negotiations. This matter is currently under consideration by the government. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>London. Well-informed sources here recently confirmed that Soviet Ambassador Maisky, in a recent meeting with Foreign Secretary Halifax, explained two points: (1) The Soviet Union will continue to adhere to the policy of neutrality that it should maintain in the current war. (2) The Soviet government is prepared to conduct business negotiations with Britain. It is generally believed that whether this position will be proven by facts remains to be seen. As for the important developments in Moscow yesterday, there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Ambassador Maisky's statement at this time. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>London. According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union's policy in the Western European war is a "firm neutral policy," which can also be described as an "armed neutral policy." At the same time, it is actively establishing hegemony in the Balkans and the Black Sea, and excluding the influence of Britain, France, and Germany along the Baltic coast, forcing Germany to devote all its efforts to dealing with the situation in Western Europe. If this policy fails, it may adopt a tougher attitude. In short, Soviet foreign policy has five goals: (1) To limit Turkey's power in the Balkans, maintain its neutrality, and defend the Black Sea on behalf of the Soviet Union, while at the same time restraining it from actively assisting Britain and France against Germany, thereby undermining the balance of power in the Balkans. As for the Mediterranean, the Soviet Union has no vested interests, so the clauses of the agreement signed between Turkey and Britain and France regarding the Mediterranean can still be respected by Turkey. In other words, Turkey's actions in the Mediterranean are not subject to any restrictions, but military action should be avoided in the Dardanelles Strait, which is the gateway to the Black Sea. (2) Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia should form a neutral bloc under the joint influence of the Soviet Union and Turkey. Dobruja, Romania, which belonged to Bulgaria before the First World War, should be returned to its original owner. If Romania can accept Soviet control, the issue of Bessarabia Province (which belonged to Russia before the First World War) can be postponed. (3) Germany can obtain economic concessions in the Balkans, but on the condition that they do not constitute a monopoly. (4) A Polish buffer state may be established between Germany and the Soviet Union, but on the condition that Germany accepts the above points. (5) Estonia along the Baltic coast should be included in the Soviet sphere of influence, and Latvia may also be included. As for Lithuania, it can be included in the German sphere of influence. After the realization of these five points, Germany's area for expanding its influence into Eastern and Southeastern Europe will be reduced by itself, but it can devote all its efforts to dealing with the war in Western Europe. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that Germany will definitely accept it. Otherwise, the Soviet Union may have to adopt a tougher attitude. Diplomatic circles here commented that Germany originally wanted to conquer Eastern Europe when it started this war, but due to the threat from the Soviet Union, it had to abandon its original plan. As for Turkey's influence in the Balkans in the future, it will also be reduced, while the influence of other countries in the Balkans will be completely eliminated, and they will have to allow the Soviet Union to establish hegemony. As for Italy's attitude, it is still uncertain, but because the Soviet Union's influence in the Balkans is increasing day by day, it is unlikely to sit idly by and do nothing. Even Germany, whose non-war goal was to develop economic influence in Southeastern Europe, may not be willing to obey the Soviet Union. In addition, British diplomatic circles also used the possibility of Germany adopting a "peace offensive" as a topic of discussion, and all said that if this were to materialize, it would definitely be rejected by Britain and France. The current question lies in whether the Soviet Union will support Germany's offensive. Regarding this point, Soviet sources in London said that although the Soviet Union may support the peace offensive, if Britain and France reject it, the Soviet Union does not intend to assist Germany. In short, the Soviet Union will still strictly adhere to neutrality towards Britain and France, but on the condition that those countries do not exert pressure on the countries of Southeastern Europe. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky informed British Foreign Secretary Halifax of this intention yesterday. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Paris. After Germany and the Soviet Union signed various agreements, observers here commented that the policies pursued by those countries can be summarized in four words: "Bluff, Blockade, Baltic, Balkans." (That is, the four words Bluff, Blockade, Baltic, Balkans, also known as the four B policy) As for the various issues caused by these four words, the first three words are included, at least in Moscow. The "peaceful adieu" that Dehe was supposed to propose to Britain and France should be backed by the threat of a military alliance treaty signed with the Soviet Union, but the joint declaration of the various countries did not mention the word alliance treaty, only that if the peace offensive fails, the governments of the various countries should "consult each other." On the contrary, the economic agreement signed between Germany and the Soviet Union is very practical in content. Some of the resources that Germany cannot obtain due to the blockade imposed by Britain and France can be supplied by the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union can only supply "a part." People were originally very worried about Germany's attempt to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union. When they examined the various agreements signed by those countries yesterday, and the non-aggression treaty signed on the 23rd of last month, they knew what Germany gave when bargaining with the Soviet Union. But how much the Soviet Union paid is unknown and remains to be proven by facts. This is the same as the situation when Germany previously signed a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. What is noteworthy is that Germany has abandoned the proposal to establish a buffer state in Poland, and it has no say in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Estonia. Now that Estonia has signed a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union, it has virtually become a protectorate of the Soviet Union, and has lost its autonomy in military and political terms. Even its foreign trade will be monopolized by the Soviet Union. Regarding this, well-informed sources here said that when Soviet troops entered Poland, the Estonian government approached Germany and asked it to provide protection when the Soviet Union added pressure. The German government immediately replied that the Soviet Union had no ambitions towards the countries along the Baltic coast. Based on this, Germany has obviously been forced to abandon its position in that area. As for the Balkan issue, Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu has been active in Moscow to ensure that Germany and the Soviet Union do not resolve it on their own before Turkey participates, but the Balkans are ultimately a source of supplies for Germany, and when the Soviet Union and Turkey conduct negotiations in the future, they will definitely pay attention to this. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>Moscow. Molotov's letter to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop stated, "Your Excellency Minister, regarding our discussions, I now hereby confirm to Your Excellency as follows: The Soviet government, based on the general political agreement we have concluded and its spirit, is willing to do everything possible to develop economic relations and trade volume between the Soviet Union and Germany. For this purpose, both parties will formulate an economic program, and according to this program, in the long term, the Soviet Union will supply Germany with raw materials, and Germany will pay for them with industrial products. When the two countries draft this program, they should try to make the total amount of trade between Germany and the Soviet Union reach the highest level in the past. The two governments will issue necessary instructions to enable the above measures to be realized, and to find ways to start and complete the relevant negotiations as soon as possible. I respectfully await your approval. Molotov." On the same day, Ribbentrop replied to Molotov, stating that the German government agreed to issue all necessary instructions in accordance with the spirit of Molotov's letter. (TASS dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>Estonia Becomes a Soviet Protectorate, Soviet Union Obtains Right to Station Troops on Land, Sea, and Air, Contents of Treaty Publicized in Moscow Yesterday</p>
<p>Moscow. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the President of the Republic of Estonia, in order to develop friendly relations between the two countries based on the recognition of national independence and the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs established by the Treaty of Peace of February 2, 1920, and at the same time recognize that the Treaty of Peace of February 2, 1920, and the Treaty of Non-Aggression and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes of May 4, 1932, are still a solid foundation for mutual relations and mutual affairs, and believe that determining practical conditions for guaranteeing mutual security is in line with the interests of both parties, and therefore recognize the necessity of concluding the following Treaty of Mutual Assistance, and have therefore appointed plenipotentiary representatives, on the side of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and Foreign Commissar, and on the side of the President of the Republic of Estonia, Selter, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the two plenipotentiary representatives have agreed on the following conditions:</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union in the Current Phase of the European War</h3>
<p>The European war began with the start of the German-Polish conflict, and it has now been a full month. In this month, the situation has shifted and evolved quite complexly; but the one who has manipulated and consistently influenced the situation is none other than the Soviet Union. The past is irrelevant; as of today, the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has once again visited the Soviet Union for negotiations, and the London side is eagerly seeking to follow suit, even sending a high-ranking official, possibly the respected and aged Lloyd George, to use his influence and prestige to make up for the "second-tier role" sent to the Soviet Union for inquiries a month ago. The demarcation of Poland has just been completed, and a dark cloud has suddenly risen in a corner of the Baltic Sea, making the situation in Eastern Europe uncertain; and then, just yesterday, the mutual assistance pact between the Soviet Union and Estonia was suddenly completed, and the Baltic Sea area immediately became calm, and the impact will make half of Eastern Europe peaceful. Therefore, Moscow is indeed the center of gravity of the current situation. Comparing it to history, traveling scholars hurry to it, and envoys of states are constantly en route, so Xianyang and Linzi can be used to describe its prosperity. Yet, although envoys from various countries flock to Moscow, rushing for fear of being late, we have never heard of the Soviet Union sending envoys to other countries to plot anything: therefore, the difference in status between host and guest, and the importance of each, is evident. It is not an exaggeration to say that the Soviet Union holds the key to the situation today.</p>
<p>To say that the development of the European war has reached the current stage and is not far from its end is undoubtedly premature; but to say that it is just beginning and will inevitably develop into a long-term war is also nothing more than a possible assumption. Germany's strength lies in its military force, while its undeniable weakness is its economic poverty, so it benefits from a quick and decisive victory; the military strength of Britain and France is not inferior to Germany, and their economic situation is more than adequate, so they might as well engage in a prolonged campaign. Although Germany wants a quick victory, and Britain and France do not want it, the fact is that it cannot but be prolonged: but if Germany wants to cover up its weaknesses and struggle in the midst of inevitable prolongation, it must make preparations in the economic field. The Soviet Union, with its abundant resources and surplus power to help others, is naturally an object of Germany's aspiration. Moreover, Romania, since the Soviet Union deployed troops on the Polish border, has been encompassed by Soviet influence; and this country is rich in agricultural products and has continuous oil fields, which are also what Germany aspires to. Therefore, Germany's future lies only in courting the Soviet Union to help it; if a military alliance cannot be achieved, then economic support would be enough to satisfy its great desire. The wishes of Britain and France are the opposite of Germany's. Whatever Germany hopes to succeed, Britain and France will do their best to dissolve it. Therefore, the only way to remove the firewood from under the cauldron is to follow the same path and make friends with the Soviet Union before Germany's wooing of the Soviet Union has matured. In short, today's situation of horizontal and vertical alliances is nothing more than a brewing of a new future European situation, and what the outcome of the brewing will be, the Soviet Union can truly control it.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's ability to influence the current and future European situation is due to its environment, but also due to the fact that it has been conserving its strength and replenishing its energy for more than a decade, which is by no means accidental, but it must not be complacent about it. Because only when it has the power to make a decisive move, it must exercise caution in this one move, and if there is any mistake, the impact will be great. In the past month or so, the Soviet Union has indeed repeatedly made surprising moves, but its adherence to its own position has been consistent. Its treaty with Germany stops at non-aggression; its agreement with Japan on Nomonhan only allows for a temporary cessation of hostilities in the area; and its recent pact with Estonia is for mutual assistance. Because of the difference in targets, it changes the way it uses diplomacy. This is not just what the world calls flexibility, but only in this way can it act autonomously and maintain its own position without being influenced by the environment. Therefore, its future actions will still be cautious and will still maintain its own position, and it will never disrupt its own steps because of complacency. However, what we hope from the Soviet Union is that it will use its current superior position to exert its active role and make the European situation, and even the world situation, clear.</p>
<p>The European war was initially thought by the world to be a war against aggression, but when Czechoslovakia, Austria, Albania, etc. were divided and conquered, no one heard Britain and France speak out for justice; and the collective security system strongly advocated by the Soviet Union was never sincerely cooperated with by Britain and France from the beginning, so it failed to materialize; when the Danzig issue became imminent, and Britain and France themselves were about to feel threatened, they had to rise up to help, but they still hesitated before the Siegfried Line for nearly a month, and Poland had in fact reached the point of collapse, while the Western Front had not yet played a role in containing it; therefore, it is impossible not to doubt that this war is like the imperialist war of conquest twenty-five years ago, but Britain and France have taken a defensive posture, so it has become an illusion of anti-aggression. A war between strong countries is a chaotic process, and the result, apart from reshaping a part of the map, has little meaning. When the war first started, the Soviet Union expressed its intention to stay out of it, but suddenly it sent troops and swallowed up most of Poland; not only did it not participate in the war of conquest, but it also claimed neutrality without anyone exposing its hypocrisy; not only did it share the spoils while sitting, but it also made both sides of the warring countries rush to please it; human civilization thus regressed by thirty years, but the Soviet Union took advantage of the opportunity, seizing and plundering skillfully, and in an instant, achieved this achievement, which has already become a historical miracle, something that the Tsarist era dreamed of but could not obtain. What is commendable is that it bullied the weak, but at the same time restrained the strong; because Britain and France fought each other, and no matter what the outcome, they would no longer be able to dominate because of the Soviet Union's restraint. The world may take Poland as a lesson and suspect that the Soviet Union may use the same method to divide China with Japan (see yesterday's Moscow telegram); if so, it would not only bully the weak, but also help Japan's strength and dominance; the Soviet Union is certainly not so foolish, and China has all the excellent conditions for nation-building, how can it be compared with Poland, which surrendered the city and begged for mercy, allowing others to slaughter it!</p>
<h3>A Page of the Painful History of Poland's Resistance: Warsaw's Military and Civilians Negotiate Surrender; Germany Announces 100,000 Troops Disarmed; Great Fire Unabated, City Reduced to Rubble</h3>

<p>The Hague: A correspondent from a newspaper stationed in Warsaw sent a deeply painful dispatch, recounting the surrender of the city's defenders. It stated, "When a delegation of Warsaw residents, carrying a white flag, met with the German commander, a Polish army colonel said with tears, 'Our commander has decided to surrender and has come to negotiate.' The German commander replied, 'It is gratifying that the war has come to an end. I hope that Warsaw has not suffered major damage after days of shelling.' The Polish officer also replied, 'Apart from the rubble, there is nothing else.' All of this is the tragic end of Poland. One point cannot be ignored: the Polish people fought bitterly with a strong enemy to defend freedom, and although defeated, they are honorable and should permanently enjoy the right to independence in history." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

A Polish news agency dispatch from Warsaw stated that the Warsaw defenders were negotiating with the Germans on the terms of the surrender of Polish troops in Warsaw and Modlin. Negotiations are expected to be concluded today. The citizens of Warsaw are in favor of surrender, while the defenders want to continue resisting. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>London: Polish officials in London recently received a telegram from the commander of the Warsaw defenders, reporting on the defense of Warsaw on September 27. It stated that there was fierce fighting west of the Vistula River last night and this morning. German attacks from the southwest were repelled. Polish counterattacks resulted in some captures and the seizure of four tanks and three cannons. The Germans used a large number of incendiary bombs, and the great fire in Warsaw has been burning for several days, with the central area burning the most intensely. The water pipes have been destroyed, making it impossible to extinguish the fire. The streets are now in flames, and water is being transported by vehicles to supply the people. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to a correspondent from the Hutung News Agency traveling with the army, after the Polish troops in Warsaw expressed their unconditional surrender, the commander of the Polish troops in Warsaw sent a major officer with instructions, accompanied by a German colonel, a major, and eight soldiers, to the commander of the Modlin Fortress, ordering him to hand over the fortress to the German army. The fortress commander immediately agreed and promised to surrender at 6:00 PM yesterday. Unexpectedly, after 6:00 PM, the Polish troops did not hoist a white flag, so the German artillery bombarded it fiercely. Then, a Polish officer rushed to the German position and reiterated the unconditional surrender. (Hutung dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Hungarian Military Representatives Survey Border</h3>
<p>Budapest, Hungary: A Soviet military delegation, together with a Hungarian delegation, surveyed the border between the new Soviet border (i.e., the southern border of Poland) and Hungary this morning. Traffic between the two sides has been restored. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>Paris: The French High Command announced last night that the German army launched an attack on the French positions southeast of Sarralbe this morning, with the aim of driving out the French artillery positions near the small mountains on the German side, which currently control Sarralbe and the Moselle River basin. As a result, the Germans suffered heavy losses. The Germans spent the entire night attacking the French forts outside the Siegfried Line through the small forests. The French army was on high alert. At dawn, German tanks rushed down from the small mountains, passing through Sarralbe to the highway west of the river. The weather was difficult to endure. The French army remained on the front lines all night. French machine gunners swept the German army, and French artillery fired on the German tanks. After an hour of fierce fighting, the German army was repelled. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Luxembourg City: Continuous artillery fire has been heard here since 2:00 PM today, coming from the front lines of the French and German armies. Under the cover of artillery fire, the French army advanced towards the area of ​​Berch in the German Saar region, and shelled the town of Boug to the northeast, which was very successful. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Luxembourg: Since 2:00 PM today, the artillery battle on the Western Front has been very intense, and the artillery fire has not stopped. Although the close cooperation of the British and French air forces was only seen in the French war report today, the power of the British and French air forces has now begun to be felt by the enemy on the Western Front. Germany has lost many aircraft in the Polish war, and it is still necessary to leave some aircraft in Poland. The remaining aircraft have been flying non-stop for the past three weeks, and it will take a long time for a large-scale inspection. Apart from air force activities, the German army launched an attack in the territory west of Sarralbe yesterday. The general impression is that the German military authorities want to launch small attacks in rotation at various points along the entire line to test the movements of the French army. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

Reservists from the Romanian fleet have been called up. At the same time, the embassy in London has reportedly notified reservists of the naval air service to register with the embassy's military attaché.

From now on, the Soviet Union will have a superior strategic position in the Baltic Sea compared to Germany. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes New Neutrality Act; A Major Victory for the Government Over Isolationists; Senate Scheduled to Begin Debate Next Monday</h3>
<p>Washington: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, after reviewing the Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Chairman Pittman, passed it by a vote of 16 to 7. The Senate is scheduled to meet on October 2 to discuss it. According to informed sources, the discussion in the Foreign Relations Committee today was very intense. It was originally possible to postpone the vote until tomorrow, but it was successfully passed, which is a major victory for the government over the isolationists. Democratic Senators Keyes of Tennessee and Guffey, as well as Republican Senator White, originally opposed the provision in the amendment to repeal the arms embargo clause, but they voted in favor of it today, only stating that they reserved the right to express dissent when it is submitted to the Senate for discussion. Of the seven members who voted against it, five belonged to the Republican Party: Borah, Johnson, Capper, Vandenberg, and Clark. The other two were Progressive Senator La Follette and Farmer-Labor Senator Shipstead. In addition, the Foreign Relations Committee, as a result of today's discussion, amended two points in the original proposal: (1) If a debtor government fails to repay the principal and interest in full within ninety days after the due date after the United States provides credit loans to belligerent countries, it cannot obtain new loans. (2) US merchant ships and civil aircraft may still anchor or land in the ports and airfields of belligerent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the aircraft of Pan American Airlines flying the Pacific route can still use the airfields of belligerent countries in the Western Hemisphere. This amendment is of great importance to the future of US commerce with South America and the Far East. Pittman recently told the press that the Foreign Relations Committee unanimously agreed during today's discussion on allowing domestic merchant ships and aircraft to anchor or land in the territories of Britain and France in the Western Hemisphere, but on the condition that US merchant ships and aircraft do not transport goods to those territories. The focus of future debate will be the issue of repealing the arms embargo clause. Responsible sources said that the situation regarding the transfer of Pittman's proposal to the Senate for discussion is very good, which can be seen from the fact that the proposal received a majority of affirmative votes in the Foreign Relations Committee and that Senators Reynolds, Keyes, and White changed their attitudes. The reason why these senators changed their original intentions was due to the influence of public opinion in their constituencies. The media in the central states is extremely shocked by the fact that German National Socialism is extending its power to Western Europe and even to the Western Hemisphere, and its power is far above the arguments held by the isolationists. In other words, most Americans are not deeply impressed by legal arguments such as upholding international law, but they are very stimulated by the facts that German troops invaded Poland, German troops bombed civilians, and German submarines launched indiscriminate attacks. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington: During yesterday's Foreign Relations Committee meeting, the debate focused on the government's proposal regarding the impact on American merchant ships. The proposal aims to prohibit American ships from transporting goods to belligerent countries. A leading isolationist, Borah, claimed that the Foreign Relations Committee spent most of its time discussing the impact of the "cash and carry" method. Shipping companies approached the Foreign Relations Committee because the strict amendments to the bill would cause them huge losses. The Foreign Relations Committee then made technical amendments to the Neutrality Act amendment to suit the opinions of the American transport industry and passed it by a vote of 16 to 7. The voting results were announced by Senator Pepper at 1:20 PM. The bill sent to the Senate stipulates the abolition of the current embargo on weapons, ammunition, and implements of war, and replaces it with transfer and cash and carry clauses. According to the clauses, the United States may sell any items to belligerent countries, but ownership must be transferred in the United States, and they must be transported by ships of other countries. The main amendment to the bill by the Foreign Relations Committee is to exempt American transportation companies from a clause prohibiting American aviation from passing through the territories of belligerent countries in the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific Ocean. This exemption is limited to air transport, and American merchant ships are not allowed to sail to the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>US and Canada Extend Silver Purchase Agreement by One Month</h3>

At the current New York silver price, it is 35 cents per ounce. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Pan-American Conference Holds Closed-Door Meeting; Neutrality Issues and Economic Cooperation Are the Focus of This Conference</h3>
<p>Panama City: The Pan-American Conference held a closed-door meeting this morning. Representatives from Bolivia and Paraguay delivered speeches, reiterating their countries' policies of friendship and good neighborliness. Representatives from other countries responded with warm applause. Up to now, the conference has received about 30 proposals. It has been decided that the various subcommittees will review them separately this afternoon. The general impression is that the resolutions to be passed by this conference can be divided into three categories: (1) Resolutions on the declaration of neutrality, the content of which is nothing more than (A) delineating neutral zones around the American continent, (B) taking various measures to defend against submarine attacks, and (C) when the neutrality of one American country is violated, other American countries should consult each other to take joint action. (2) Resolutions on economic cooperation issues, the content of which should be to establish permanent institutions to adjust and promote the economic relations of American countries. (3) Resolutions on reiterating the rights of neutral countries, the content of which focuses on declaring that neutral countries may continue to export various goods that are not directly used for war to belligerent countries as usual. In addition, the conference will also decide to hold the next conference in Havana, Cuba, in 1940, and will urge all belligerent countries to pay attention to the humanization of war. As far as is generally known, the content of the aforementioned first resolution, namely the resolution on the declaration of neutrality, is mainly based on the proposal submitted by the representative of Uruguay, and also adopts two or three points in the proposal submitted by the representative of the United States, Welles, and the full text is about to be completed. In summary, there are two major issues discussed at this conference: one is the issue of trade between American countries and Europe, and the other is the issue of setting up neutral zones around the American continent. The representative of Brazil has also proposed that American countries conclude individual or multilateral agreements to determine the quality air routes between American countries. The representatives of the Central American countries did not make any suggestions, but only decided to support all the claims made by the US government. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Romanian Cabinet Partially Reorganized; Foreign Policy Unchanged</h3>
<p>Bucharest: The Argetoianu cabinet underwent a partial reshuffle today. Interior Minister Marinescu was transferred to become Minister of Public Security, his vacancy being filled by Ottescu. All other cabinet members retained their positions. Premier Argetoianu, along with all his cabinet members, was sworn in by King Carol II at 9 p.m. tonight. According to responsible sources, the new cabinet's composition indicates no change in Romania's current policies. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Premier Argetoianu is 68 years old and has held many important positions in the diplomatic world and in the cabinet. As Minister of Finance in 1931, he implemented Romania's debt reorganization plan and is a recognized financial authority. His appointment as Premier leads to the belief that his policies will remain strictly neutral. (Haitong, 29th)</p>

<p>Berne, Switzerland: It has come to light that German Führer Hitler, accompanied by Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, unexpectedly visited the northern German port of Wilhelmshaven to inspect the submarine fleet and expressed his appreciation for the activities of the submarines. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Information has issued a statement saying, "German radio stations have repeatedly broadcast news that British warships were damaged by German aircraft in the North Sea. The British Admiralty reiterates that no British warships have been damaged by German aircraft, and there have been no casualties among the officers and men. The German side also claims that a British giant cruiser was hit by a German bomb in the Irish Sea off the Isle of Man, which probably refers to a German aircraft's attempt to bomb a British destroyer in that area. In fact, none of the British destroyers were hit at the time, and there were no reports of any British cruisers being attacked in the vicinity." (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Last night, German radio hinted that the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" had been destroyed by German aircraft in the North Sea on Wednesday of this week. The radio station, due to the British Admiralty's persistent denial, questioned, "Where is the 'Ark Royal'? This is what the British people want to know." Furthermore, the German High Command announced that a squadron of German aircraft flew to the Firth of Forth yesterday morning to bomb the British fleet, resulting in a 550-pound bomb hitting the bow of a certain heavy cruiser. Therefore, this air raid was considered a "success." As for whether the German side suffered any losses, this was not mentioned. (United Press, 29th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Warships Penetrate Polish Territory; Soviet Ship Allegedly Attacked by Submarine in the Baltic Sea</h3>
<p>Moscow: According to Soviet newspapers, warships of the Soviet Dnepr River Flotilla have penetrated 125 miles into Poland, passing through the canal and advancing north towards Brest-Litovsk. It is reported that although the Polish army has scuttled most of its river defense warships, some undamaged warships were abandoned in haste. These warships have been requisitioned by the Soviet army, and some of the sunken ships have also been salvaged and are being towed to Soviet shipyards for repairs. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<h3>British Investigation of Wartime Finance; Reduction of Bank Discount Rate; Abandonment of Inflation</h3>
<p>London: The British Financial Board's reduction of the bank rate to 3% yesterday is the first step in facilitating borrowing to meet national defense needs. The interest rate cut was announced simultaneously with the emergency budget, seemingly as a coordinated plan to achieve greater efficiency in wartime finance compared to the last Great War. In fact, the last Great War's finances relied entirely on inflation, and the government paid very high interest on war bonds because investors expected the purchasing power of currency to be low when debts were repaid, so they could not lend at low interest rates. However, this time the government seems to aim to abandon inflation and raise the cheapest possible loans to fund national defense. Now, all types of private fundraising are subject to direct control, so the traditional argument for raising interest rates to restrict civil borrowing no longer exists. Moreover, foreign exchange controls now protect the London financial market from external disturbances, so there is no need for bank interest rates to protect the pound. According to London sources, there is a possibility that the interest rate will continue to decrease to 2%. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister's Departure Statement</h3>
<p>Moscow: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop left Moscow by special plane at noon today to return to his country. Before departing, he made the following statement to the press: "I regret that I could not stay longer in Moscow. I hope to stay for several days when I visit again. However, I have made full use of the two days to complete four tasks: (1) The German-Soviet friendly relations have been firmly established; (2) Germany and the Soviet Union will not allow any third party to interfere in Eastern European issues from now on; (3) Germany and the Soviet Union hope to restore peace as soon as possible, and that England and France will stop their meaningless and uncertain war against Germany; (4) If those in England and France who advocate war still prevail, Germany and the Soviet Union will take countermeasures." Ribbentrop then announced the economic plan agreed upon by the German and Soviet governments yesterday, stating that this plan is very far-reaching and of great benefit to both Germany and the Soviet Union. Ribbentrop concluded his speech by saying that his visit to Moscow for negotiations was conducted in a very harmonious atmosphere, with both sides sincere in their attitude. He expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality of the Soviet government, especially Stalin and Molotov. (Haitong, 29th)</p>

<h3>German Prisoners Receive Excellent Treatment in England</h3>
<p>London: Most of the German prisoners captured by Britain are housed in a five-story yarn factory in an industrial area in the north. Some of them are German submarine crew members. Most of them have changed into civilian clothes, but a few are still wearing naval trousers and military boots, looking quite distinctive, but slightly haggard. Their average age is 23. When they entered the reception center today, they met German prisoners who were already there. They never expected to meet here, so they had the feeling of meeting countrymen in a foreign land. According to the intelligence agency, the German prisoners are surprised by the excellent treatment they receive in England, as they had heard stories of British mistreatment of prisoners in their own country. It is said that when the first batch of German prisoners arrived, they intended to perform the Nazi salute to the staff in the center, but the staff quickly stopped them. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3>Statement from the Military Affairs Commission: One Week of Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (September 20th to 26th), the battles on all fronts have been very fierce. The Japanese army on the Xiang-Gan (Hunan-Jiangxi) northern front has been using all its naval, land, and air forces to launch attacks. Our entire army and soldiers have been bravely giving their lives, engaging in fierce battles on the northern and southern battlefields. The intensity of the battles and the number of enemy captured are unprecedented in recent months. The more important operational developments are described as follows:</p>
<p>Xiang-E (Hunan-Hubei) Front: The enemy in northern Hunan has launched a large-scale offensive in three routes this week. The left wing is moving towards the southeast of Tongcheng, the central route is attacking Xinqiang River along the Wu-Chang Road, and the right wing, with a part of the marine corps, is forcibly landing from Lujiaoshi and Yingtan on Dongting Lake. Under the cover of airplanes and poison gas, the offensive is extremely fierce. Our army is intercepting the enemy on separate routes at places like Maishi, Yanglinjie, Lujiaoshi, and Yingtan, with repeated fierce battles. Our army launched a full-scale counterattack, and the Japanese regiment commander, Yamamura Haruo, was killed. On the 24th and 25th, the battle situation became even more intense, with enemy casualties exceeding 7,000. Fifty to sixty speedboats were sunk. Our surprise troops even raided the enemy's rear, once recovering Tongcheng and advancing to capture important strongholds southeast of the city and southeast of Yueyang, capturing countless enemies. We are currently continuing the bloody battle. Their attempt to occupy our territory will surely come at the highest price. In addition, the outlying strongholds of Yangxin and Mushigang, as well as Jinniuzhen and Hujiapu west of Daye, have also been recovered after bloody battles. The county seat of Donghuang'an has been under our fierce siege this week. The enemy is stubbornly resisting in the city. Yangbaifu in the west of the city has been captured. The officers and soldiers took advantage of the situation to charge and kill, once breaking into the city and capturing a large number of enemies.</p>
<p>Ganbei (Northern Jiangxi) Front: The enemy in various locations in northern Jiangxi, such as Dachang, Fengxin, and Wuning, has gathered thousands of infantry and artillery troops since last week and launched a large-scale offensive towards Gao'an in separate routes. One route sneaked west to Huibu and Shangfu, spying on Cunqianjie from the south, attempting to attack the rear of Gao'an. Another route, with two to three thousand Japanese troops, fiercely attacked Xiangfuguan and Sigongshan northeast of Gao'an, adopting a strategy of converging attacks. After intercepting and engaging in fierce battles along the routes until the afternoon of the 19th, our troops in the county seat once transferred to the suburbs of the city. However, after reinforcements arrived, they launched a fierce counterattack, successively recovering the outlying strongholds of Shangfu, Huibu, and Cunqianjie. The enemy's momentum wavered. By the evening of the 21st, our main force launched a full-scale attack again, charging and killing extremely fiercely. By dawn on the 22nd, the enemy could not hold on and broke through and fled in disarray. The county seat was declared recovered. After days of fierce pursuit, we successively captured key points such as Sigongshan, Xiangfuguan, and Wuqiaohe. The enemy retreated towards Nanchang and Fengxin. Our vanguard has already reached the outskirts of Fengxin, intensifying the siege and cutting off the traffic between Fengxin and Wuning, and advancing towards the county seat of Wuning. The enemy suffered heavy casualties after the defeat, with countless firearms, ammunition, and supplies captured by us.</p>
<p>Guangdong Front: The enemy in Chao-Shan (Chaozhou and Shantou) has been under our fierce attack last week. We once charged into Chao'an and approached Shantou, recovering Chitan. We have continued to sweep up the remaining enemies in the surrounding areas for days, completely blockading their transportation lines. Another route of Japanese troops launched a fierce attack on Chenghai on the morning of the 21st, attempting to relieve the siege of Chao-Chi. After a day and night of bloody battle, on the morning of the 12th, our army temporarily transferred to the suburbs due to the disparity in numbers and continued the fierce battle. On the same day, at noon, the Japanese troops in Sanshui and Yangmei launched a fierce attack on Nanbianxu. We braved the Japanese army's poison gas and artillery fire and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army. The position was once lost, but the officers and soldiers joined forces to counterattack, charging into the Japanese army's position and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. By 6 pm, the area was declared recovered. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in this battle, abandoning many corpses, weapons, and ammunition. Another unit of Japanese troops that attacked Xialegang was also repelled, and the situation is currently at a stalemate. As for the Japanese troops that attacked Zhongshan, after our army recovered Zhangjiabian, the remaining Japanese troops retreated. The battle has gradually become calm. In addition, the remaining Japanese troops on the Xinhe and Xinkai routes have been completely eliminated. The Japanese army retreated to defend the city walls, daring not to act.</p>
<p>Jin-Yu (Shanxi-Henan) Front: The Japanese troops in Changzhi, Changzi, Huguan, and other places in southeastern Shanxi are still under our army's close siege. On the afternoon of the 20th, a part of the Japanese troops in Changzi attempted to sneak out of the city and reach the vicinity of Xixiaohe, but were defeated by our army. The remaining troops fled back. On the 21st, our army occupied Sijiachi and Zhouzhuang, and that night advanced to occupy the south gate of Huguan, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese army, killing or wounding about 800 Japanese troops. The Japanese troops along the Hongtun Avenue, after our army recovered Fuchengzhen last week, received reinforcements on the 20th and launched another attack to the east. More than a thousand Japanese troops in Xiwucen also fiercely attacked Mabicun at the same time. After our army launched a large-scale counterattack on the 21st and 22nd, the remaining Japanese troops fled back. Our army ambushed near Caojiacen, killing or wounding nearly a thousand Japanese troops. The Japanese troops who invaded Chuan (southeast of Xiyang) on the 20th in eastern Shanxi were counterattacked by our army on the 21st, killing many Japanese troops. The Japanese troops retreated north to Min'an. In addition, more than two thousand Japanese troops once attacked Guxian and Fuchengzhen from Hoxian in the east, attempting to open up Hongtun Avenue. After days of fierce attacks along separate routes, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and fled west across the river. As for our army in eastern Henan, we attacked Chenliu on the 18th and once broke into the city, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese army, killing many Japanese. At the same time, another unit attacked Zhuxianzhen, killing over a hundred Japanese troops. The Japanese barracks and warehouses were all burned down. In addition, our army in western Sui repelled the Japanese troops invading from Baotou, killing over three hundred Japanese troops. Our troops in southern Hebei charged into Daming and recovered Dongming. In northern Jiangsu, following Ganyu and Danji, we recaptured Xin'an Station on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway.

Along the Jing-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) line, we once recovered Xinfeng Station. These are all important battle results of the week, and are reported here for your information.

<h3>U.S. Has No Criticism of Wang Chonghui's Remarks</h3>
<p>Washington: State Department officials, including Secretary of State Hull, did not criticize yesterday the remarks made by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui to the Associated Press reporter, stating that the United States is in a superior position to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. One State Department official explained that the State Department did not criticize because it had not yet received an official report on Wang Chonghui's opinion. The State Department here seems unwilling to be bound by the mediation issue by expressing opinions on only one side of the parties involved in the Far Eastern War. Therefore, it is generally believed that the United States will not make specific criticisms until Japan's attitude is clearly expressed. Wang Chonghui stated to Maurice, the Far East manager of the Associated Press in Chongqing yesterday, that the United States is in a position to mediate the Far Eastern War. He personally believed that the Chinese National Government could agree to order a cessation of hostilities on all fronts to allow the Japanese army to peacefully withdraw from China, but this must be conditional on Japan's adherence to the above-mentioned method as a prerequisite for peace. At that time, Wang also solemnly declared that China's policy has not changed, and China is determined to fight until the final victory. (Special dispatch from James of the Associated Press on the 29th)</p>
<p>Washington: Chinese Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Chonghui gave a statement to Maurice, the Far East branch manager of the Associated Press, yesterday, saying that the United States could mediate between China and Japan. After receiving the news here, Secretary of State Hull answered questions from reporters, saying that he had not yet studied it. State Department personnel said that the U.S. government must wait for the two countries concerned to make a request before it can consider the matter. In addition, the Chinese Embassy has not received official news from that country. (Dispatch from Havas on the 29th)</p>

<h3>Fujian Province Suffers Repeated Air Raids: Civilian Casualties Total Approximately One Thousand, Property Losses Exceed Five Million</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the War of Resistance, Fujian Province has suffered repeated bombings by Japanese aircraft, resulting in huge losses to people's lives and property. According to a report from the Provincial Disaster Relief Association, as of July of this year, more than 1,500 bombs have been dropped by Japanese aircraft in various counties of the province, killing 344 people, injuring 516 people, and displacing more than 2,100 households due to the disaster. Property losses exceeded 5.1 million yuan, with Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Lianjiang, Tongan, and Jian'ou suffering the most severe losses. In Lianjiang County, only on July 2nd and 3rd in Tailu, Zhenhai, Xiaocheng, and other places, more than 400 houses were destroyed, displacing more than 2,100 people and causing property losses of more than 2 million yuan. The remaining counties that have not submitted reports have not yet been included in the statistics. Since its establishment six months ago, the Provincial Disaster Relief Association has issued a total of 128,090 yuan for peacetime disaster relief and 252,087 yuan for temporary and air raid disaster relief. The amount issued by the disaster relief associations in various counties has not yet been included in the statistics.

<h3>The Xi-Cheng Road is Damaged, and the Japanese Army is Imposing Severe Intimidation</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The electric wires and bridges along the Xi-Cheng Road are often damaged by Chinese mobile units. Recently, eight electric wires were cut off at Tangtouqiao. The Japanese army was at a loss. The day before yesterday, Zhishengye, the captain of the Japanese guard, convened a meeting of pseudo-township directors along the line, claiming that if such incidents occur again in the future, they will be wiped out regardless of whether they are good or bad, and ordered the township directors to form a road protection association, and those who wander on the highway will be killed without pardon. At the same time, an intimidating announcement was issued, stating that the Japanese army is determined to take extraordinary measures to ensure the safety of the Xi-Cheng Road and communication lines. Residents nearby who damage highways, bridges, or cut telephone lines will be treated as guerrillas regardless of the reason and severely punished in accordance with military law. Other nearby residents should also bear the same responsibility. If anyone attempts to sabotage roads and communications, invades villages, or discovers the current state of other sabotage, farmers must quickly report to the Japanese garrison and passing Japanese troops. Those who protect highways, bridges, and telephone lines, report the situation of damage as soon as possible, and repair them voluntarily will be rewarded. This announcement was posted throughout the villages along the Xi-Cheng Road, but the farmers turned a blind eye and remained indifferent.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army in Southern Shandong Recaptured Tancheng, and the Japanese Army in Linyi is Also Shaken</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Tancheng is an important town in southern Shandong and a vital transportation hub between Jiangsu and Shandong. The Japanese side attaches great importance to this place and often dispatches more than a hundred mechanized troops to garrison it. The Chinese army has attacked several times, losing and regaining it in turn. Most of the houses in the city have been reduced to scorched earth. Recently, the Chinese XX Army, in order to cut off the communication between the Japanese troops in southern Shandong, specially deployed elite troops to cooperate with local teams. At dawn on the 11th, they began to attack the Japanese army in three routes, catching the Japanese army by surprise and immediately reaching the outskirts of the city. A select commando team climbed the walls and entered the city. For a time, hand grenades and rifles were fired in unison. The Japanese army woke up from their dreams and engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army. However, mechanized weapons were no longer effective. The two armies engaged in close combat, hand-to-hand bloody battles. The Japanese battalion was occupied by the Chinese army, and fires were set everywhere, creating a tense situation. After a night of bloody battle, the Japanese army could not hold on and broke out through the north gate, fleeing in disarray. In addition to sending a team to pursue, the Chinese army searched for the remaining Japanese troops in the city and eliminated them. In this battle, a large number of spoils were obtained. Except for the slightly wounded who retreated with them, the Japanese army left behind more than seventy corpses, mostly not taken away. After the Chinese army officially recaptured Tancheng, the Japanese army in Linyi felt extremely panicked and also showed signs of being forced to flee.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Repeated Invasion of Zhongshan: Japanese Warships Break Through the Hengmen Blockade Line, and Chinese Teams are Fighting a Step-by-Step Resistance</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: After the Japanese army in Guangzhou launched the first invasion of Shenzhen and Nantou and then retreated, they launched another invasion of the western sea of Guangdong. Because Shiqi in Zhongshan is the only way to enter and exit the western sea, and since the transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong was cut off, Shiqi has become a vital passage for Cantonese officials and people from the occupied areas to go to Macau and transfer to Hong Kong. Merchants and travelers are constantly on the road, so the Japanese army is eager to include Shiqi, Zhongshan in their bag. Several months ago, they once invaded Shiqi with naval, air, and land forces, but after landing at Boliwei and Shiqingwei, they only plundered a large amount of grain and failed to penetrate the urban area of Shiqi. When the Japanese navy attacked the Hengmen blockade line, a shallow-water warship was sunk by Chinese mines. This Japanese invasion of Zhongshan can be said to have not been worth the loss. Not long after, the Japanese army suddenly gathered a large number of troops at the southern end of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and again captured Nantou and Shenzhen, rushing to the Sino-British border, claiming to gather more than 10,000 troops to cut off traffic from Kowloon to the inland areas of the East River. Therefore, the Japanese troops invading Zhongshan were transferred to the Pin'an line, and there were no traces of the Japanese army in Zhongshan. When the Sino-British border incident eased, the Japanese army again dispatched troops from various places to launch the second invasion of Zhongshan on September 9, in cooperation with the navy and air force, using more than 30 motorboats and 3 warships, carrying 500 to 600 marines. First, they destroyed the blockade at Hengmen, Zhongshan, rushed into the Hengmen River, and followed the old road, landing at Qiqingsha and Boliwei. They also divided a part of their troops to disturb Shanzhoukeng along the inner river, but this vanguard had a limited number of people. Once the defense army fought bravely, the Japanese army fled back to the warships in a panic. On the 11th, the Japanese army gathered miscellaneous troops again and invaded on a large scale in two routes. One route attacked Dawangtou from the villages, and the other route attacked Licun along Shanzhou, spying on Xiaoyin, attempting to converge at Shiqi, and bombarded the villages along the coast with warships. Several Japanese planes formed a team, transporting bombs to bomb the defense army's positions. The Japanese army on the left quickly occupied Shanzhou and the villages in the fourth district, setting up a command post in Shanzhou Elementary School. The defense army team firmly defended Xiaoyin to protect the outer line of Shiqi. The Japanese army on the right landed on the north bank of Hengmen and covered more than 20 motorboats carrying hundreds of soldiers with shallow-water warships, occupying Dawangtou on the 12th. The defense army fought bravely, with intense fighting at Dawangtou, Erzhou, and Sanzhou. On the 13th, the fighting was still fierce. On the evening of the 12th, the Shiqi defense army launched a counterattack against the Japanese army in Shanzhou in two routes, once regaining strongholds such as Baimishan and Dajianfeng. On the morning of the 13th, the Japanese army reinforced its troops and used aircraft to assist in the abuse. The Chinese army retreated to Licun again. After the 13th, the situation in Zhongshan suddenly tightened, and fierce battles had broken out in Xiaoyin and Zhangjiabian, the outer lines of Shiqi. The Japanese army attacked Zhangjiabian fiercely from Dawangtou on the north bank of Henghe. The Chinese army took Zhangjiabian as a shield for Shiqi and intensified its defenses. On the Xiaoyin front, the defense army was still in control before the 13th. However, on the 14th, the Japanese army reinforced its troops from Licun to attack, and the positions in various villages in Xiaoyin were destroyed by Japanese bombs. The defense army had no danger to defend and was forced to withdraw to Zhangjiabian, concentrating its forces. On the 14th, the focus of the battle shifted to Zhangjiabian. In order to defend the central area of Shiqi, the Chinese army counterattacked the Japanese army several times. From the evening of the 14th to the morning of the 15th, the Japanese army gradually could not hold on, and the defense army regained the rear mountain position of Zhangjiabian. It was also heard that the Japanese warships had sailed into the Jinzhong River and had been remotely bombarding with heavy artillery for days. Many shells fell near Shiqi, such as Niuxiguan and Baishawan. The river transportation in Shiqi has been blocked. The city is evacuating people, and citizens are fleeing to Macau or the Siyi inland areas, in a state of disarray.</p>

<h3>Finance: Swap Rates Ultimately Deemed Too High, Many Long Positions in Foreign Exchange Closed Out</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. In the informal market for British and American currencies, it was reported that Foreign Minister Wang discussed the Sino-Japanese war, and the United States was likely to mediate, increasing the possibility of success. As the settlement date approached and swap interest became higher, many non-strong September long positions had to be closed out at a loss. Also, Huaxing sold British gold. Although some Chinese merchants tried to buy, the foreign firms' appetite was weak, and the supply remained good, leading to a strengthening market. The closing price for British gold was 4 pence 375, and the US exchange rate was 7.375 yuan. In the afternoon, the Japanese Zhengjin Bank and Chinese merchants tried to buy, but foreign firms such as Youli were strong sellers, making it difficult to escape the loosening trend. As a result, the closing price was the lowest of the day, with British gold at 4 pence 4375 and the US exchange rate at 7.4375 yuan, 125 higher for British and 21875 lower for the US, compared to the previous day. After the close, the situation softened slightly. Due to the upcoming September settlement, some unwilling to delay hands had to swap October futures, and the discounts were still rare, making the loosening less severe than the spot market. According to the evening closing, the difference for British gold was 15625 and for the US exchange rate was 3125, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 0.256%. It was heard that Hua Bi offered Chinese merchants US dollars at 25, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 0.336%, and Chinese merchants also offered a certain bank US dollars at 375, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.499%. Trading was still active throughout the day.</p>
<p>Swap Transactions Showed Some Activity</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's large spreads narrowed by half a penny recently and decreased by 5625 in the long term. New York silver prices fell by two points. London's spot gold remained unchanged. The exchange rates for British vs. US, vs. Shanghai, and vs. France were all flat. The US vs. British continued to increase by 125, vs. Shanghai increased by one dime, and vs. France increased by 25. The central exchange rates remained the same as before. Banks' morning spot selling prices were British gold at 4 pence 3125 and the US exchange rate at 7.25 yuan, slightly firmer by 03125 for the US compared to the previous closing price, due to the slightly longer exchange rate. After opening, Huaxing first offered foreign firms spot British gold at 4 pence 34375 and 375. Then, a certain American bank also offered Chinese merchants spot. The US exchange rate increased from 7.25 yuan to 375. At the same time, Youli sold US dollars for October to Chinese merchants at 7.0625 yuan, resulting in a loose and firm process. When the HSBC exchange rate was announced, it remained unchanged, and when the white silver balance tax was announced, it was slightly lower by two points and 75. Afterwards, a certain bank absorbed US dollars for October from a peer at 7.125 yuan. Subsequently, the transactions became slightly clearer. However, there was still activity in the September and October swap, so the situation was slightly stable. It was heard that Hua Bi offered arbitragers US dollars at 25, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 0.336%. At noon, Chinese merchants offered a certain bank US dollars at 375, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.499%. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 4 pence 375 and the US exchange rate at 7.375 yuan, looser by 0625 for British and firmer by 125 for the US compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks' Selling Interest Was Also Strong</p>
<p>In the afternoon, because foreign firms such as Youli and Datong had strong selling intentions, although Japanese Zhengjin Bank and Chinese merchants slightly absorbed, it was still difficult to escape the loosening trend. It was calculated that Youli sold spot British gold to peers at 4 pence 40625 and 4375. Then, Datong and a certain bank also sold spot US dollars to peers and Chinese merchants at 7.375 yuan and called 375. At that time, Youli offered Japanese Zhengjin Bank US dollars for October at 7.125 yuan. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 4 pence 4375 and the US exchange rate at 7.4375 yuan, the same as the spot for this month. British gold for October was 4 pence 28125, and the US exchange rate was 7.125 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, both the spot and this month's British gold were looser by 125, and the US currencies were all firmer by 21875. British gold for July was only looser by 015625, and the US was lower by 09375. It was heard that the prices slightly rebounded after the closing. The bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 4 pence 40625 and the US exchange rate at 7.40625 yuan, and the US exchange rate for October was closed at 7.125 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Spot US Exchange Rate Tightened</p>

The Shanghai exchange rate increased by 1.5 yuan, to 118.5 yuan. The "Allied Note" informal market was higher by two yuan, to 84.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Shift from Buying to Selling, Gold Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold informal market fluctuated after two days of gains, as reports of Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's remarks created an atmosphere of peace. The foreign exchange market loosened as a result, causing the market to open lower at 4,110 yuan. As pawnshops and spot gold dealers rushed to sell, buying interest from money changers temporarily emerged, and some gold dealers who had previously sold came back to buy, slowing the price decline. Prices fluctuated between 4,100 and 4,050 yuan, with the midday closing price at 4,065 yuan. The market slightly weakened in the afternoon, opening at 4,055 yuan. However, securities firms and money changers supported prices, pushing them back up to 4,075 yuan. As the foreign exchange market reportedly fluctuated, many speculative positions were closed out, and securities firms stopped buying and aggressively sold. With few buyers willing to step forward, the market plunged, closing at a low of 4,020 yuan, down 103 yuan from the previous day. It was reported that the market continued to weaken after the close, with selling pressure from securities firms and a lack of support, pushing prices below 4,000 yuan to a low of 3,995 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market slightly rebounded after the close, prices rose again, returning to around 4,020 yuan. Trading remained active, with over 2,000 taels traded. The price of gold jewelry fell by 15 yuan, while customs gold prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Plunges by Over 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the initial situation was unfavorable. The foreign exchange market's potential was firm, and buyers were cautiously watching. The opening price was down by 13 yuan. A gold dealer sold 10 taels to a money changer for 4,110 yuan. Afterwards, pawnshops and spot gold dealers rushed to sell, and the situation weakened further, with prices dropping by another 50 yuan. Pawnshops sold 10 taels to a money changer, and a gold dealer sold 30 taels, both for 4,060 yuan. At that time, a money changer suddenly absorbed on behalf of a customer, pushing prices back up by 40 yuan. The money changer bought 20 taels from a securities firm for 4,100 yuan. After that, the buying appetite gradually weakened, and the foreign exchange market remained loose. The selling pressure from pawnshops resumed, causing prices to fall again, dropping by another 50 yuan. A spot gold dealer sold 10 taels to a money changer for 4,050 yuan. As a gold dealer bought at a low price, the price decline stopped, soon recovering by 30 yuan. A gold dealer bought 20 taels from a pawnshop for 4,080 yuan. Near noon, a money changer suddenly sold again, and gold dealers stopped buying and watched, causing prices to fall again, dropping by 20 yuan. A money changer sold 30 taels to a pawnshop for 4,060 yuan. Then, another money changer bought 20 taels from a gold dealer for 4,065 yuan, setting the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was slightly weaker, down by 10 yuan from the noon closing. A gold dealer sold 10 taels to a money changer for 4,055 yuan. After opening, money changers had some appetite, and securities firms also came to buy, pushing prices up by 20 yuan. A money changer bought 20 taels from a pawnshop, and a securities firm bought 20 taels from a money changer, both for 4,075 yuan. As the foreign exchange market reportedly loosened, securities firms immediately stopped buying and sold again, and retail sellers followed, causing prices to plunge, dropping by 55 yuan. A money changer sold 20 taels to a gold dealer for 4,020 yuan, setting the evening closing price. As a result, prices plunged by 103 yuan compared to the previous day. It was reported that the market continued to weaken after the close. A gold shop sold 10 taels to a spot gold dealer for only 40 yuan. Then, a securities firm sold 10 taels to a money changer for 3,995 yuan.

<h3>Fractional Currency Notes Issued Yesterday</h3>

They were printed by the American company Yongning using No. 2 banknote paper. The fractional currency notes were issued yesterday (the 29th).

The center of the back shows a circular model of the back of a five-fen nickel coin. The four corners contain the Western characters "five fen." The center contains the serial number.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>The foreign currency market was very soft yesterday, as the atmosphere of peace intensified after Mr. Wang Chonghui's speech, and the foreign exchange market repeatedly loosened. The gold market began to rebound, causing even more anxiety. Selling pressure was frequent, and prices declined. The British gold pound fell by two yuan, the gold note fell by 5 jiao, the American gold pound fell by 1.5 yuan, the gold note fell by 0.37 yuan, the Hong Kong note fell by 1 jiao, the French franc note fell by 0.15 yuan, and the Singapore note, Dutch note, and Philippine note each fell by 0.2 yuan. The Canadian note fell by 0.4 yuan, the Japanese gold note fell by 0.06 yuan, and the Korean note fell by 0.05 yuan. The remaining currencies remained stable.</p>
<h3>Important Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>A Chongqing dispatch dated September 6 reported that commodity prices there were very high due to the imbalance between supply and demand. Monthly board was 13-14 yuan per person, white rice was 3.3-3.4 yuan per dou (equivalent to two market dou), pork was 0.5 yuan per jin, chicken was 1 yuan per jin, and vegetable oil was 0.7-0.8 yuan per jin. Other local products also rose by two to three times. The prices of imported goods were even higher. Cigarettes were the most expensive, with a small box of ten Great British cigarettes costing about 0.5 yuan, which was astonishing.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Soar by 1.2-1.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>The informal securities market situation yesterday was suddenly influenced by Minister Wang Chonghui's talk of peace, and the atmosphere was stronger than before. As gold prices declined, government bonds suddenly soared. In these days of plentiful rumors, the speculative market felt severely shaken. Short positions covered, long positions added, all at once like bees swarming. Those taking opportunity to sell at the high price however were not lacking either. Further, due to offering prices being too high, it caused a segment of the long position to exit. Subsequently it was seen pressed by a few dimes, but ultimately with the popularity being excited, it was low and rose again. Yesterday in the morning, at the initial opening the C grade was immediately 6 yuan, a sudden climb of 1 yuan several dimes. Those buying were particularly excited by the 25th series. As for the rest such as Lianyi, Tongyu, and sporadic retail investors, the appetite for eating was strong. Yongkang then took the high point to sell out. Retail investors also let go. Later, with the market price coming back down several dimes, Tiansheng then took the low price to buy in again, again rising several dimes. The afternoon shape of the situation was relatively stable, and the majority continued to be firm. There was still an appetite for the 25th series. Yongkang continued to have a sale. In the end, the closing price was calculated to have gained 1.2 to 1.35 yuan. The total transaction amount was about 1.12 million yuan. A simplified table is presented as follows:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions, traded 50 shares of the Bank of China, priced at 52 yuan exactly.</p>
<p>The Public Association also reported: When the stock market opened yesterday, it was abnormally firm, but after entering, many long positions which had been taking profit emerged, and the prices turned weak, mostly falling to the levels of the day before. However, for the stocks that were taking profit, it seemed easy to absorb them. It can be proven to be not false to observe that at the time when the prices of the various stocks had a slight return, the buyers rallied into action.</p>
<p>London, 28th - Today's listed prices for shares of East Asian British trading companies are not yet fully opened. The overall market is stable. Only the Kuala Lumpur Rubber shares fell by six pence to fifteen shillings and nine pence.</p>
<p>London, 28th - Today, the listed prices of four types of Chinese foreign debt, including French and American gold, are stable and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Ten-Count Coarse Yarn Demand from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Tianjin Remains Strong, Not Affected by the Decline in Twenty-Count Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to show divergent trends, with fine yarns declining and coarse yarns rising. The atmosphere has become more relaxed, due to rumors of renewed peace talks and rising securities prices, which have dampened enthusiasm for long positions in cotton yarn. At the same time, demand from South China has decreased significantly. However, ten-count coarse yarn still has sales in the northern Tianjin area and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Therefore, the market has detached from the twenty-count yarn market and is advancing independently. As for the situation of ten-count cotton yarn, there is temporarily no hope of rising. If it continues on its current declining trend, a price drop may be possible. It is also unknown whether there will be any price declines. Five bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>The morning opening for current yarn remains sluggish. Most intentions were neutral on yarn prices and unwilling to take long positions. In addition, customer transactions were inactive. The current price for Double Horse twenty-count yarn was 748 yuan. Although it did not move, spot paper was being sold but not bought. Soon after, sudden rumors caused a drop of ten yuan, with warehouse receipts at 735 yuan and spot prices falling from 780 yuan to 70 yuan, fluctuating between 4-5 yuan in between. The closing was slightly better. Half-day transaction volume was recorded at 1,885 yuan. The prices for Double Horse twenty-count yarn were down 12 yuan, Tiannv was down 5 yuan, and Double Globe was down 7 yuan. However, ten-count yarn was up 5 yuan. The amount bought by each trading group is listed below: Mainland 485, Hong Kong 10,5 Traders 1,115 Tianjin 150 Total 1,885</p>
<h3>Stocks are not Surging, Tonghua Rose by 4 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton trade still flourishing, and the market price progressively moves forward. But apart from Shenxin and Yong'an factories, no other factories have purchased in a great manner. However, the atmosphere is especially strong, because the incoming stock everywhere is not surging. Thus, the market's inventory is dry, and therefore, sale prices lowering is hopeless. The material for ten count coarse yarn is even more lacking. Moreover, since the sales of yarn have started to pick up recently, the manufacturers increase what they need. So, the Pinggu flower cotton's price, compared to the day before, rose by 9 yuan. Tongzhou flower also rose by a magnitude of 4 yuan. 989 white-wrapped cotton bags have arrived at the piers.

<h3>Eleven Japanese Military Vehicles Overturned at Henglin Yesterday Morning, Chinese Guerrilla Destruction of Tracks Effective, Intercepted Military Supplies and Killed More Than 30 Japanese Soldiers, New Fourth Army Heavily Wounded Japanese Army on the Zhencheng Highway</h3>
<p>Recently, the Chinese guerrillas in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have become increasingly active. The Japanese army, due to frequent deployments, can only deploy troops in important transportation line areas. Therefore, places slightly farther away from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines have mostly become gathering places for Chinese guerrillas. In addition, the local people's feelings are激昂 and they cooperate, so that the Japanese army is exhausted and unable to cope. Even the Beijing-Shanghai line, the transportation center, has been destroyed by Chinese guerrillas several times. Yesterday morning, a guerrilla interception of Japanese military vehicles occurred again at Henglin Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Road. The entire vehicle overturned, and nearly 100 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. Therefore, traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai Road was suddenly interrupted. It is reported that the situation of the Chinese guerrillas' surprise attack this time was even more rapid than previous times. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Guerrillas More and More Active</p>
<p>A month ago, the Beijing-Shanghai Road was damaged by Chinese guerrillas, causing the locomotive to overturn and many passengers were injured. The Japanese army stationed there, seeing the guerrillas' power was vast, did not dare to resist. Later, the tracks were repaired and traffic resumed, but travelers to Beijing were already wary. It is reported that the Chinese guerrillas in the suburbs along the Beijing-Shanghai Road belong to the Jiangnan Volunteer Army and have considerable strength. Usually, in addition to protecting railway traffic, the Japanese army lacks the extra strength to deal with the guerrillas' actions. Recently, because the Chinese guerrillas in the Nanjing and Zhenjiang areas have become more active, the Japanese army is planning to provide military supplies to the Japanese army in that area to meet the needs.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Vehicle Overturned Midway</p>
<p>On the evening of the previous day (28th), a train of Japanese military vehicles, a total of eleven vehicles, loaded with military supplies, and guarded by Japanese soldiers, totaling about 100 people, armed with guns and ammunition, set off from Shanghai North Station under heavy guard, intending to drive to Nanjing. It was expected that at about 12 o'clock in the late night of the previous day, when the vehicle was driving through Shitangwan Luoshe, near Henglin Station, suddenly because dozens of feet of the track there had been destroyed by Chinese guerrillas, and the small number of Japanese troops stationed there had not noticed beforehand due to the guerrillas' agile actions. When the military vehicle sped to that place, with a loud crash, the entire vehicle overturned and fell into the rice fields beside the road.</p>
<p>More Than Thirty Japanese Soldiers Killed</p>
<p>At that time, the Chinese guerrillas bravely advanced, and the sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of beads. The Japanese soldiers in the car responded hastily after the car overturned, and suffered heavy casualties. More than 30 Japanese soldiers were killed on the spot, and the rest were injured. It was not until about 1 o'clock in the morning yesterday that the gunfire subsided. The Chinese guerrillas then collected the military supplies in the car and left.</p>
<p>Traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai Line Completely Cut Off</p>
<p>At that time, Henglin Station could not notify the neighboring stations Luoshe and Qishuyan because the traffic had been destroyed by the guerrillas. It was not until the guerrillas withdrew that they were able to find a way to notify the outside. The Japanese army stationed in Wuxi and Changzhou heard the news and could not provide assistance. The road authorities then dispatched craftsmen to Henglin yesterday morning to repair the tracks. It is reported that the express train and ordinary passenger train that departed from Shanghai to Beijing at 8 am yesterday could not proceed after arriving in Wuxi and were waiting for the track to be repaired before continuing. The trains going south to Nanjing did not arrive in Shanghai yesterday, and it is reported that they all stopped in Changzhou. As of last night, it was heard that the damaged tracks in the Henglin section had not been completely repaired.</p>
<p>Good News Also Reported on the Zhencheng Highway</p>
<p>According to people from Changzhou, the New Fourth Army, in commemoration of the 8th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, specially ordered its subordinate units to be the general offensive period from September 15th to 17th. After receiving the order, each unit made meticulous arrangements according to the planned plan and launched attacks separately. A unit of the × regiment of the army, which is famous for its combat reputation, because of its flexible intelligence, immediately went to the Chenjiaqiao area of the Zhencheng Highway at 4:30 on the 16th.</p>
<p>Ambush Everywhere</p>
<p>Soon enough, nine military trucks, loaded with more than 300 Japanese soldiers, came speeding. The Chinese army waited for them to approach the firing range, and then each jumped out of the ambush and treated them with fierce hand grenades and strong firepower. At the same time, they used obstacles to cut off their return route. The Japanese army was caught off guard, and because the vehicles could not be driven, they were killed and injured in a hurry, no less than</p>
<p>More Than Two Hundred People</p>
<p>Later, because the Chinese army's hand grenades were exhausted, two lagging trucks were allowed to escape by the Japanese army. In this battle, a total of seven Japanese military trucks were destroyed, one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, and one water machine gun were captured, as well as more than 50 "Type 38" rifles. Other military flags, command knives, documents, baggage, etc. were also very numerous. After the Chinese army withdrew, the Japanese army went to</p>
<p>Collect the Corpses</p>
<p>It is estimated that they were stacked on three trains (trucks) and left. The Chinese army only sacrificed nine people and injured more than 30 people. The wounded soldiers were immediately taken by local people to a safe area for recuperation. Now people are visiting and expressing their condolences along the way.</p>
<p>After the Fact, It Was Learned</p>
<p>One hour after the start of the decisive battle, the Japanese army in Xixiashu and Benniu, which are adjacent to Chenjiaqiao, heard the news and immediately sent a large number of reinforcements. However, they were ambushed by the Chinese army along the way and collapsed without reaching their destination. It was also heard that the captain of the Japanese army stationed in Xixiashu was killed as a result.</p>
<h3>Fractional Currency Notes Issued Yesterday, Gradually Circulating in the Market, Financial Institutions and Various Agencies Went to Redeem, Not Fully Issued Yesterday, Redemption Continues Today, Temporary Value Certificates Must Be Recalled by Themselves Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank announced that it will issue fractional currency notes from yesterday, and after entrusting the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association to forward them, they have begun to circulate in the market from yesterday. The issuance method will be handled in accordance with the auxiliary currency regulations. The Ministry has ordered that all temporary value certificates issued by various industries in the past must be recalled within a time limit, and the problem of difficulty in finding change in various industries has gradually been resolved. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Issued Yesterday Morning, Circulating in the Market</p>
<p>The Central Bank's fractional currency notes are printed by the American Yongning Company. The first batch is 500,000 yuan, including 300,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan in five-cent notes. They were issued and circulated in the market yesterday. They are printed on No. 2 banknote paper, and the cost of paper and printing is quite expensive. The front and back of the one-cent note are red. On the front, there is a nine-story pagoda on the left and the words "One Cent, Republic of China, Year 28" on the right. On the back, there is a number on the upper left, a seal on the lower left, the words "One Cent" in Western characters in the middle, and a round one-cent copper coin reverse model on the right. The front and back of the five-cent note are blue. The front is slightly the same as the one-cent note. On the back, there is a round five-cent nickel coin reverse model in the middle, with the words "Five Cents" in Western characters on both sides.</p>
<p>Used in the Market, Without Discount</p>
<p>After the fractional currency notes are delivered by the printing company Yongning Company to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, they were issued by the bank at 8:00 yesterday morning. The Tobacco Exchange Industry Association sent Zhang Shibin and Shen Yinhe to receive them with funds. At the same time, various banks and money houses directly sent people to the bank to receive them. By 6:00 pm yesterday, a total of 100,000 yuan each of one-cent notes and five-cent notes, totaling 200,000 yuan in national currency, had been issued. The distribution of the fractional currency notes is carried out at full face value, and there is no discount in the market. At the beginning of the issuance, raising prices is strictly prohibited. The Central Bank does not set up another exchange, and it is hoped that all sectors, except banks and money houses, will not directly request an exchange from the bank.</p>
<p>Number of Fractional Currency Notes Accepted</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired at the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank and learned that the issuance of fractional currency notes is handled in accordance with the auxiliary currency regulations, and is fully prepared with legal tender. The number of acceptances is in accordance with Article 5 of the auxiliary currency regulations, "The number of nickel coins accepted each time is limited to 20 yuan in legal tender. The receipt and exchange of copper coins and the Central Bank are not subject to this restriction. Anyone who collects 20 five-cent notes or 100 one-cent notes may exchange them for one yuan in legal tender at the Central Bank." The first batch of 500,000 yuan will be issued entirely in Shanghai. As for the second batch of printing, it will be decided according to the needs of the market.</p>
<p>Central Bank Handles Silver and Money Exchange Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to the bank's spokesperson's statement to the Daguang News Agency, the new currency procedures issued by the bank are all handled in accordance with the Ministry's orders and the General Bank's instructions. The exchange matters handled by the bank today (that is, yesterday) are all related to the banks and money houses in the city, and the decision is made by the Customs, the Post Office, and the Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the two concession public works bureaus. All requests for exchange amounts are supplied according to the bank's need for the bank, etc., and the convenience of exchanging the number requested is not given. The steps for restricting the number of exchanges have been discussed with the staff in charge, and there is no need to stipulate them in writing.</p>
<p>All Value Certificates Ordered to Be Recalled Regarding the value certificates temporarily issued by various companies and firms in Shanghai in the past to cope with the lack of change, the circulation in the market is quite large. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has ordered the firms that issued them to recall them within a time limit in order to emphasize the country's entire monetary system. As for the postage stamps that used to replace change, in addition to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's submission to the Ministry for remedy, the Postal Administration has notified the postmasters to accept them in a flexible manner. Since yesterday, because fractional currency notes have been issued, all value certificates except those issued by the wood shops have been refused to accept value certificates from other shops. As for the token certificates of the tram company, it is heard that the company has decided to stop issuing them again.</p>
<p>Tobacco Exchange Association Forwards and Uses</p>
<p>After the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association received the fractional currency notes from the Central Bank yesterday morning, it forwarded them to the member tobacco exchange shops at No. 487 Ningbo Road at 9:00 am, and announced at the door, "Fractional currency notes are temporarily returned to cooperative shops for exchange today." The exchangers were very crowded. The tobacco exchange market was temporarily closed yesterday. Yesterday morning and afternoon, the tobacco exchange industry received a total of 60,000 yuan of fractional currency notes from the Central Bank, which were completely forwarded to the member tobacco exchange shops. It is scheduled to submit to the Central Bank again today to continue forwarding matters. It is reported that there are more than 3,000 members of the association in the city, more than 200 cooperative members, and more than 100 tobacco companies, totaling more than 3,300. The number exchanged yesterday was not enough for distribution.</p>
<p>Individual Citizens Not Allowed to Exchange</p>
<p>The Central Bank is very cautious about the procedures for distributing new currency notes, as it is sufficient to meet the current legitimate needs of all industries in the city. In addition to the banks, money houses, major companies, foreign companies, tram companies, and automobile companies, all other individual citizens who want to exchange at the bank will be rejected. The reason is that once the new currency notes are circulated in the market, they can be transferred to the public at any time, and it will not be difficult to use them. The bank authorities intend to issue new currency notes in the future, and they must decide based on the needs of the market.</p>
<p>Change Situation in the Market Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, a group of unscrupulous tobacco exchange counterparts took the opportunity to profit, and when exchanging the current fractional currency, they could only exchange 9 points of new fractional currency notes for every 1 jiao of auxiliary currency, or even only 8 points, otherwise they would refuse to exchange. Because of the above situation, it is very difficult for residents to obtain the fractional currency. The value certificates of trams, public buses, and various companies such as Da Sun, Sincere, and Wing On were not rejected by the public yesterday, because they are still suitable for practical needs. As for the various value certificates printed by other stores, they have mostly notified that they will be recalled within a time limit, so these miscellaneous certificates have obviously gradually disappeared in the market.</p>
<h3>Principal and Interest of the Gold Loan Due Today, Payment Begins, Divided into Six Periods, One Month Each, Paid with Shanghai General Exchange</h3>
<p>The Customs Guarantee Unified Reconstruction Gold Loan and other domestic debts. After the Ministry of Finance temporarily suspended the repayment of principal and interest due to the interception of customs duties, the National Debt Fund Committee consulted and obtained the consent of the four banks of Zhong Zhong Jiao Nong. The four banks discounted the payment. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired with the banking industry and learned that the 12th principal and interest due of the long-term financial public debt of the Republic of China in 1928, totaling 1,125,000 yuan in principal and 400,7812.5 yuan in interest, totaling 1,532,812.5 yuan in principal and interest, will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted China Communication Bank on September 30 (that is, today). Shanghai will be divided into six periods, each period is one month to pay it off, and it will be paid with the Shanghai General Exchange.</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver Import and Export Statistics Both Show Surplus</h3>
<p>January to August The Customs published the gold and silver import and export statistics announced by the Customs: (1) In August this year, gold imports from the UK to Shanghai were 168 taels, and exports from Fuzhou to Hong Kong were 44,565 taels. Silver exports from Fuzhou to Hong Kong were 10,166 yuan, and there were no imports. (2) From January to August this year, gold imports were 372 taels, and exports were 1,369,452 taels. Silver imports were 824 yuan, and exports were 1,901,589 yuan. It is estimated that the gold surplus was 1,369,116 taels, and the silver surplus was 1,900,765 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gas Surcharge Increased, Public Works Bureau Has Passed, Surcharge Increased to 80 Percent, But the Bureau May Reconsider at Any Time</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company recently requested the Public Works Bureau to approve its request to increase the current gas surcharge (23 percent) in order to increase revenue to offset the increased operating expenses due to the contraction of foreign exchange. The company's petition, along with a revised budget based on 3 pence and 3/4 of a British penny equaling 1 yuan in national currency, was submitted to the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Bureau for consideration on the 18th of this month.</p>
<p>Two Petitions Submitted, Both Rejected</p>
<p>It is noted that the company submitted two petitions to the Public Works Bureau in May and July of this year requesting approval to increase prices, both of which were rejected by the Bureau. The current request was reviewed by the Chief of the Finance Department of the Public Works Bureau. The Chief believes that the budget that the gas company had previously set based on an exchange rate of 6 and a half pence must be greatly revised due to the recent sharp drop in the exchange rate. Although there are some places in the revised budget recently submitted by the company that can be changed,</p>
<p>It Is Necessary to Increase to Make up for Losses</p>
<p>But it is still necessary to increase the surcharge in order to make up for the loss of operating expenses. The coal used by the company is paid in foreign currency, and various other expenses are also greatly affected by foreign exchange. Therefore, the Chief intends to request the Bureau to approve the Gas Company to add a surcharge of 80 percent on bills ending on or after November 1 of this year. This surcharge should be reconsidered by the Public Works Bureau at any time before the end of April next year, depending on the company's operating conditions. The above recommendation has been approved by the Public Works Bureau's Board of Directors.</p>

<h3>Chaotic Situation in Western Shanghai: The Shanghai Municipal Council Strives for a Solution, Conducting Daily Discussions with the Japanese Puppet Municipal Government, Seeking a Proper Resolution. The Puppet Municipal Government Has Notified Foreign Residents to Collect Property Tax</h3>
<p>Yesterday, tax collectors from the puppet "Municipal Finance Bureau" visited foreign residents residing outside the Shanghai International Settlement along the extended roads in western Shanghai, notifying them that starting next month, property taxes should be paid to the puppet "Finance Bureau." It is understood that the puppet "Municipal Government" is taking this action because the "Reformed Government" has cancelled the monthly subsidy of 450,000 yuan. Due to financial constraints, they are vigorously trying to open up this new "tax" source to compensate.</p>
<p>Foreign Residents Feel Threatened</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 29th), the number of puppet police in the extended road area visibly increased. Consequently, foreign residents have also felt extreme tension. A senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in a conversation with reporters yesterday afternoon, also admitted that there are extreme difficulties in the tax collection issue on the extended roads. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council is making every effort to find a way to resolve this difficulty as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Negotiations Continue</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to unconfirmed reports obtained by reporters, representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet Municipal Government have been conducting daily discussions on the issue of extended roads, hoping to find a viable solution. During the meetings, the following suggestion was made: both parties agree that the Shanghai Municipal Council has complete jurisdiction over Yu Yuan Road and all the alleyways on that road, while other areas in western Shanghai are ceded to the puppet police patrol team.</p>
<p>Residents of Western Shanghai Move Away in Droves</p>
<p>Since the puppet police intruded and set up posts along the extended roads of western Shanghai, residents have been uneasy and are planning to move. In addition, the puppet "Municipal Government" has notified residents in the area that property tax will be collected starting next quarter, causing even more panic. A wave of moving is at its peak. Moving furniture, trunks, and other items all day long, attracting passersby to stop and watch, all of whom are filled with sighs.</p>
<p>Openly Carrying Heavy Machine Guns</p>
<p>As for the actions of the puppet police, they remain rampant. Yesterday morning, a team of puppet police openly carried a machine gun while patrolling the extended roads. Furthermore, since the puppet police seized and arbitrarily managed traffic posts, vehicles traveling on the extended roads have found it difficult. The puppet police are extremely unskilled in traffic management, often neglecting one thing for another, leaving drivers at a loss. Therefore, several key locations, such as the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yu Yuan Road, and the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Daxilu Road, are equipped with red and green traffic lights, which are still managed by constables, while the puppet police stand idly by.</p>
<p>Gambling Dens and Shops Close One After Another</p>
<p>In the Caojiadu area, violent incidents have been occurring frequently recently, and robbery is rampant. Not only are residents fearful, but even big gamblers are wary. Therefore, some gambling tables and opium dens in the area have closed down one after another due to declining business. As for commercial establishments, there are also many who are willing to transfer ownership at low prices because they are not profitable. The area originally intended to have military patrols, but they have not been seen since the "September 18th Incident."</p>
<p>Japanese Military Vehicle Opens Fire Without Reason</p>
<p>The English-language newspaper, The China Press, reported that the chief of the western district of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Sutter, and trainee chief of the western district of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Eiler, were patrolling from the Jing'an Temple police station on a motorcycle on the morning of today (the 29th) at about one o'clock, near Huaji Road, Jing'an Temple, not far from the Vienna Garden. When a Japanese military vehicle drove past, a loud bang was suddenly heard. At first, the two thought it was a rickshaw tire bursting, but they then found a spent bullet casing on the ground. According to the opinions of several rickshaw pullers and pedestrians, the bullet was fired from the Japanese military vehicle. The matter is currently under investigation. Many believe that the shooter may have been a group of drunken soldiers in the Japanese military vehicle, but the direction of the bullet could not be traced.</p>
<h3>Xiang-Gui Railway Has Been Extended to Liuzhou, Expected to Open to Traffic by the End of This Month, Zhennanguan to Nanning Will Open Soon</h3>
<p>The Xiang-Gui Railway has been extended to Yongfu, as reported in this newspaper. Now it is known that the section from Yongfu to Liuzhou has been completed and is expected to open to traffic by the end of this month. In addition, the section from Zhennanguan to Nanning is currently being laid, and is expected to open to traffic in November. Although the earthwork for the section from Liuzhou to Nanning has not yet been completed, it is being actively carried out, and it should not be long before it opens to traffic. Once the entire section is open to traffic, the Xiang-Gui transportation will be smooth and unobstructed, and the transportation of passengers and goods will be greatly facilitated.</p>
<h3>Forced Inoculation of Vaccines, Residents Suffer Abuse, North Henan Road's Defenses Remain Unchanged, Puppet Police Inside the Temple of the Queen of Heaven Are Unarmed</h3>
<p>After the Anglo-Japanese defense line changed in the central district north of Suzhou Creek, from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, the Japanese immediately forced local residents to be inoculated with vaccines. Because the deadline is imminent, the crowds being inoculated are increasingly crowded. The situation is described in detail below.</p>
<p>Forced Inoculations, Deadline Approaches</p>
<p>At the inoculation site under the canvas awning in front of the Shanghai Electric Power Company on North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, since the Japanese took over defense on the 12th of this month and began forcing residents to be inoculated, the area around the awning has been crowded with people waiting to be inoculated. Because the Japanese have officially announced that the inoculation will end at the end of this month, and those who do not have a vaccination certificate will be refused residence in the area, the number of residents waiting to be inoculated around the awning this morning was even greater, and the order was extremely chaotic. The Japanese soldiers and "Dadou Police" present to maintain order used rattan whips and wooden sticks from time to time.</p>
<p>Quiet Situation in the Changed Defense Area</p>
<p>The former British military station inside the Jiangsu Motor Vehicle Company at Bazi Road and North Jiangxi Road has not been occupied by Japanese soldiers since it was blocked off with barbed wire by the Japanese. Although the Japanese once went to the Cilian Branch Association Refugee Reception Center No. 19, which is attached to the Weaving Road Hospital at the western end of Bazi Road, to investigate the staff, no Japanese soldiers have been stationed there. On North Henan Road, in addition to erecting boundary markers on the eastern side of the horizontal roads, the defenses on the road are still guarded by British defense forces, and the police officers of the Huishi Police Station are still patrolling as usual, with no difference from the past.</p>
<p>Two Puppet Police Officers Unarmed</p>
<p>The puppet police at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce at the North Suzhou Road Tianhou Palace Bridge were driven away by the British defense forces. On the morning of the day before yesterday, several puppet police officers were replaced. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, these armed puppet police officers re-entered. However, when a reporter from the Datong News Agency visited the area yesterday, there was still one puppet police officer stationed at the entrance of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and another stationed at the "Permit Issuance Office," for a total of two. However, these puppet police officers were all disarmed and unarmed.</p>
<h3>Puppet Bureau's Enticement of Portuguese Vessels to Register Fails Again</h3>
<p>In order to seize the management rights of navigation and control foreign shipping, the puppet "Reformed Government Transportation" established a "Maritime Administration Bureau" in Shanghai in April of this year, located at 55 North Sichuan Road, Hongkou, and formulated navigation registration rules. An announcement was made to all shipping companies that they must register with the "Bureau" before the end of May, and threatened that those who failed to do so would be prohibited from sailing or have their ownership of the ships revoked. Because all shipping companies ignored it, the registration was extended to the end of June. However, no one inquired about it by the deadline. According to a reporter from the Daguan News Agency who inquired from the shipping industry, the puppet officials of the "Bureau" had nothing to do all day long and were extremely bored. Recently, they have tried every means to entice the detained Portuguese ships, claiming that they could be released by the Japanese and sail as usual after registering. However, the Portuguese merchants were determined and consistently negotiated with the Japanese through diplomatic channels. Therefore, this attempt ultimately failed.</p>
<h3>British Community Association Raises Funds for Wartime Use, Will Be Managed and Hosted by a Committee of British Organizations</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, the General Committee of the British Community Association held a monthly meeting on Tuesday to discuss a proposal to establish a fund for wartime work and relief purposes. The general opinion was that such a fund was more effective than issuing several different appeals. The proposed fund will be managed by a committee representing the British Community Association, the British Women's Association, the British Chamber of Commerce, and other British associations. The meeting also reported that the Rent Adjustment Committee, chaired by the Shanghai Harmonee Association, has now been established. The British Community Association has received various reports of rent disputes, which have been turned over to the Rent Adjustment Committee for handling.</p>
<h3>Sand and Gravel Shipped to Shanghai Detained Again</h3>
<p>Since the "Jiangnan Company" monopolized the sand and gravel from Si Jiao, only allowing one-third to be sold by Shanghai commercial firms, disputes have arisen within the industry. Some firms and boatmen, due to the pressure of livelihood, could not delay any longer, so they were willing to painfully sacrifice and allow this one-third sales right, while some of their counterparts opposed this proposal, so they have been at odds for several months without any concrete solutions. Chu Xiaozuo, the chairman of the industry, believing that the situation was extraordinary, and that if it was not resolved, they would all perish together, took on the role of mediator. While negotiating with the "Jiangnan Company," before the contract was signed, a temporary business office was established in Shanghai to distribute the one-third of the sand and gravel obtained to various commercial firms. Unexpectedly, of the eighty-odd ships of sand and gravel shipped from Si Jiao and other places to Shanghai the day before yesterday, only ten-odd ships entered the port, and the remaining nearly seventy ships were detained by the Jiangnan Company outside the Wusong Estuary. The industry association believes that the sand and gravel imported this time is not even one-third, so they all refused to unload the cargo, while negotiating with the "Jiangnan Company" again, asking them to release the sand and gravel ships that should have been obtained.</p>
<h3>Cotton Landing Obstructed, Japan to Continue to Exert Pressure, Cotton in Occupied Areas Is Under Complete Control, Cotton Transported Must Be Loaded on Japanese Ships, Domestic Sales of Cotton Cloth in This City Reach 30,000 to 40,000 Pieces Daily</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, regarding the recent rumors that the Japanese are prohibiting cotton from landing at various wharves in Shanghai, a reporter recently visited a major cotton merchant in this city. According to him, as a result of the Japanese exerting pressure to monopolize the entire cotton market, the Chinese who plant cotton in the cotton-producing areas are now encountering great difficulties. It is estimated that since the end of last week, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have detained more than 2,000 bales of cotton shipped from the occupied areas.</p>
<p>Shanghai Cotton Prices</p>
<p>Although the price has reached as high as 160 yuan per bale, cotton planters are forced to sell, and each bale only yields less than 60 yuan, it is said. The cotton industry in this city generally expects that the Japanese will continue to exert pressure, because it is heard that the Japanese authorities have telegraphed the handlers in the occupied areas to stop all cotton shipments to Shanghai, at least for the time being. It is said that the Japanese authorities' instructions state that all cotton transported must be loaded on Japanese ships and not stop in Shanghai, but instead go directly to Japan. Chinese sailboats transporting cotton down the Yangtze River estuary are generally prohibited, it is said. One day last week, the German merchant ships Jiangding and Haikang transported cotton, but were unable to unload it at the Shanghai wharves. This is the first sign that the Japanese are currently trying to control cotton shipped from the occupied areas. Also, since the War of Resistance, the government has actively developed the four southern and northwestern regions, and the economic life of the people in general has gradually stabilized, and from stability has gradually moved towards prosperity. The people's need for cotton cloth, which is essential for livelihood, is especially strong. However, because the textile industry in the interior is not easy to establish in a widespread manner for the time being, most of it still needs to be supplied by national goods factories in this city. Since the outbreak of the European War, the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai has fluctuated greatly, causing the Hong Kong merchants to suspend business for a time. Recently, the exchange rate has stabilized, and the Hong Kong merchants supplying the interior have seen that the price of dyes has soared, and many factories in Shanghai have reduced production and closed down, so they have telegraphed Shanghai in large quantities to purchase goods. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency met with a major figure in the industry yesterday, who said that the daily exports of various cotton cloths this week have reached</p>
<p>30,000 to 40,000 pieces. More than half of these are transferred to Sichuan and Yunnan via Hong Kong and Mazhang, and the rest are sold to eastern Zhejiang and northern Jiangsu. As for the cotton used to make cloth, recently, because the Japanese have been inspecting "removal permits" for those coming to Shanghai from southern Pudong, many have been detained, so they are now using wharf boats to unload, and transporting it to the factories by truck, which is particularly expensive to transport, and the price of cotton has taken the opportunity to rise.</p>

<h3>Deceived When Ordering Cigarettes, Four Criminals Arrested and Awaiting Investigation and Interrogation</h3>
<p>A man named Liu Yimin, previously entrusted by a customer, ordered ten large boxes of Great Britain brand cigarettes and fifty large rolls of cigarette paper from Yitaisheng Store, No. 14, Lane 140, Shandong Road, worth more than 4,000 yuan. At the time, he paid a deposit of 100 yuan, and then continued to pay 1,100 yuan. On the 24th, because Liu needed to ship the goods, Yitaisheng Store took Liu to see the goods on the 25th in Lane 1, Dongyouheng Road, where the ordered goods were all clearly present. Liu immediately agreed to deliver the goods to the Yushichang Wharf the next day, and pay another 1,000 yuan in payment. Unexpectedly, on the 26th, Yitaisheng did not deliver the goods as agreed. Later, Liu found out that Yitaisheng had already closed down, and the goods stored in Lane 1, Dongyouheng Road, were also gone. Then he knew he had been deceived and reported to the General Inspectorate. After investigation by Chinese detective Zhang Xiaolin, detective Zhu Xinwu, and others, four people, Le Ziliang, Xu Qingfang, Zhang Kanghua, and Xu Shunkang, were arrested in Room 21, 293 Hankou Road, No. 28, Yiyeli, Jialu Road, and Room 3, 395 Minguo Road, while the owner of the store, Fu Chufang, was at large. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The detective lawyer Zhang Shizhu requested permission to postpone the hearing, as the case still required investigation. After questioning by Judge Fang Qinghuan, he ruled to postpone the hearing.</p>
<h3>"Chairman of the Maintenance Association" Full of Heinous Crimes, Gun Discharges and Strikes Left Abdomen, Some Say He Was Targeted</h3>
<p>Wu Daoyin, from Qidong, 30 years old, was previously the chief accountant at the Kedy Dairy Company. After the August 13th Shanghai War, his position was taken over by his cousin, and he returned to his native Qidong. After Qidong fell, the Japanese army suspected Wu Daoyin of joining the guerrillas and arrested him, escorting him to the Japanese army headquarters in Haimen. After strict investigation, there was no suspicion, so he was introduced to Shi Renxin, the puppet "county chief" of Haimen, to work. Later, Shi assigned him to serve as the "chairman of the Maintenance Association" in a certain place. At about 10 o'clock yesterday morning, Wu Daoyin and three friends took rickshaws to Qinglonggang, Haimen, to play. Wu, as the "chairman of the Maintenance Association," usually oppressed the people, who hated him to the bone. Therefore, he was very wary when he went out. Therefore, when he went out, he carried his own pistol in his hand. Before the rickshaw arrived at its destination, the pistol in his hand suddenly went off, and the bullet hit his left abdomen and exited from his right thigh. At that time, he was seriously injured and bleeding profusely. Later, accompanied by friends, he took the Huaping Wheel to Shanghai, arriving at Pier 13 at 7 p.m. last night. He urgently called Ambulance No. 83 and sent him to Tongren Hospital. Because he was seriously injured, he had lost consciousness upon arrival. His life was in danger. It is said that this person may have been targeted, but the details are unknown.</p>
<h3>Raising Funds to Establish a Business, Funds Embezzled, All Sent to Gambling Dens on Haig Road</h3>
<p>A Cantonese man, Jian Daolin, is currently planning to organize an import and export company at 808 Juluida Road in the French Concession. During the preparation, at 1 p.m. on the 28th of this month, Jian ordered his brother-in-law Chen Tian to withdraw 5,400 yuan from the savings department of Wing On Company. Unexpectedly, after Chen withdrew the money, he took the money to the large gambling den at 368 Haig Road to gamble. Within a few hours, he had lost it all. Jian reported it to the Old Country Police Station, and Chinese detectives Guo Ruiquan and Zhou Wenqing arrested Chen, seizing 279 yuan and 10 jiao in cash. He was taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed a lawsuit for embezzlement. After questioning by Judge Fang, he ordered a postponement for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Russian Constable Commits Suicide with a Gun While on Duty and Dies</h3>
<p>A Russian man, Shi Dailao Fu (transliteration), 26 years old this year, is currently a patrolman No. 329 at the General Police Station of the French Police Department, and is assigned to serve at the French police station in the Xujiahui Church area in western Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 28th, he was assigned to duty on Puxi Road, Xujiahui Town, from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. Unexpectedly, at 7 p.m., in front of the Xuhui Public School on that road, for some unknown reason, he suddenly had the idea of ending his life. He immediately took out the service pistol he was wearing and fired a shot into his left chest to commit suicide. The bullet penetrated his back and exited, and he fell to the ground injured. The police station in charge was informed and immediately called an ambulance to send him to Guangci Hospital. Because the injury was in a vital area, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 3 a.m. yesterday morning. The hospital notified the police station and sent the body to the autopsy room attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Tairasituo Road. Yesterday morning, he reported to the Second Special Court and appointed a prosecutor and forensic doctor to come to the office to examine the body. The Chinese and Western detectives in charge reported the results of the investigation after the incident. The official ordered the body to be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Council for burial.</p>
<h3>Having a Passionate Affair with a Dancer, Accused of Obscenity, Defendant Admitted to Having Physical Relations</h3>
<p>Qian Shaoqing, a tailor from Changshu, lives at 66 Gui'an Lane, Mintini Yin Road, North Chujia Bridge, French Concession. He originally had a store in Hongkou, but after the August 13th war, he moved his family to his current address to take refuge. His daughter, named Xiuying (also known as Huizhen), is 17 years old this year. Because of her beauty and her difficult circumstances, she learned to dance. After becoming proficient, she worked as a dance partner at the Damei Dance Hall and the Jielu Dance Hall</p>
<p>Dancing in Both Places</p>
<p>She used her income from dancing to supplement the family's income. Cao Zheng (also known as Cao Zhen), a 19-year-old youth from Nanxiang, the young owner of Cao Xiangtai Cotton Cloth Store, 276 Fadama Road, went to the Damei Dance Hall to dance with a friend in the early summer of this year. He met Qian Xiuying and was stunned by her beauty. They hated that they had not met sooner and privately agreed to marry. They then had relations. Unexpectedly, after several nights, Cao's daughter was already</p>
<p>Secretly Pregnant</p>
<p>And both sets of parents were unaware. Recently, Qian's daughter's abdomen gradually swelled, which hindered her career, so she withdrew from dancing at home, waiting for Cao to hire a matchmaker to discuss marriage. However, after Cao achieved his goal, he gradually became cold towards her and abandoned her. Recently, Qian's abdomen became increasingly large, which was discovered by her parents, who found Cao to reason with him and urged him to discuss marriage. Cao ignored them. Therefore, Qian Shaoqing, the girl's father, in the name of a legal representative, hired a lawyer with his daughter Xiuying to file a lawsuit against Cao Zheng in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for</p>
<p>Seduction and Abandonment</p>
<p>Obscenity, requesting that he be investigated and punished according to law. According to the lawsuit, the court, yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Minsheng summoned both parties to the Criminal Division of the court for trial. The legal representative of the plaintiff, Qian Shaoqing, was ill, so Qian Xiuyang came to court with her attorney. According to the woman's testimony, she met the defendant around the foreign Winter Solstice last year, and was induced to have relations at the New China Hotel from May 28th to 29th of this year. Later, they moved to the World Hotel. He</p>
<p>Agreed to Marry Me</p>
<p>Now I am pregnant, but he has abandoned me. Because I am pregnant, I cannot dance, so I am suing for investigation and punishment. The defendant Cao Zheng came to court with his defense attorney Wang Hengyi and admitted to having relations with Qian. However, her mother knew about us. After verifying the testimony in court, because the legal representative of the plaintiff, Qian Shaoqing, was ill and did not come to court, it was ruled that the hearing would be postponed to October 9th, pending Qian Shaoqing's arrival. The defendant Cao Zheng was ordered to pay a guarantor who could be summoned at any time and was allowed to be taken out by the defense attorney, with a deadline for supplementing the bail the next day.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Insurance Premiums Case Still Under Investigation, Defendant's Testimony Inconsistent</h3>
<p>Rice merchant Zhu Qiu Xiong was previously sued by Rice Merchant Yuan Zhong Hou from Luxu at the Criminal Division of the First Special Court for embezzling military insurance compensation from the Central Trust Bureau. The court has already held two hearings. At 11 a.m. yesterday, Judge Xiao Peishen took the seat at the Criminal Division and continued the trial. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were present in court. According to the plaintiff, the fact that the defendant embezzled the compensation was extremely obvious, and there was a recording that could be listened to. When questioned, the defendant still claimed that the compensation he received was delivered by the Yizhong Notary Office. The remittance was deposited at the Meixin Cardboard Company on Shandong Road in September 1938, and presented a new deposit book. The plaintiff argued that the Central Trust Bureau's reply stated that the payment was in the form of a cash transfer, but the defendant now claimed it was a remittance, which clearly showed that the defendant still intended to embezzle the number of compensations. Furthermore, the defendant had previously testified that the compensation was deposited at the Juxingcheng Bank, but now he suddenly presented a deposit book from the Meixin Cardboard Company, attempting to cover up the embezzlement. Judge Xiao asked why the defendant's testimony about the deposit book was different before and after, the Meixin deposit book was brand new, and whether the compensation was transferred by the Yizhong Notary Office. The defendant's testimony was evasive. The judge said that there was still a need for a thorough investigation, so he ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Destroying a Gambling Den</h3>
<p>At about 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, 20 to 30 burly men suddenly arrived at the front and rear alleys of Xinkang Lane, Caojiadu, each wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers, looking like factory workers. Led by a young man in a suit, they arrived at the entrance of the alley and took out pistols, Mauser pistols, etc., swarming into the Dasheng Club and wantonly destroying it. For a time, the gamblers panicked and fled, and the order was in chaos. Someone reported to the "Local Police Station" on Singapore Road. By the time the puppet police arrived, the rioters had scattered and hid without a trace. Only a few suspects were captured. For a time, the area near Xinkang Lane was like a major enemy, and the residents suffered a false alarm.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Chinese Constable's Pistol, Offender Admits to Being a Lookout, and Admits to Robbing Flower Club Gambling Table</h3>
<p>Three Chinese constables, Nos. 1663, 1228, and 2457, from the Gordon Road Police Station, were on duty near Connaught Road and Jessfield Road at 7:15 p.m. on the 15th of this month, when they were suddenly surrounded by more than a dozen rioters, who robbed three pistols and eight bullets worn by the three Chinese constables, and scattered in different directions, making it impossible to arrest them. It was not until 9:15 p.m. the next day that Chinese and Western detectives from the armored vehicle team of the police station, while passing the corner of Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road, were informed by Zhang Asan, who was a lookout at the Caojiadu Flower Club gambling table, that they had found Wang Xiusheng, Wang Jinlong, and Tao Jinquan, three Anhui men who were suspects in the case of robbing the Chinese constables' pistols. They were sent to the First Special District Court, questioned and detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang attended the Criminal Division 3 and continued the trial. The lawyer representing the police station filed a public prosecution based on Article 330 of the Criminal Law on robbery, saying that the three defendants had previously admitted to the police station that because the self-defense group they organized lacked guns, they robbed the Chinese constables' pistols, and that they were all responsible for being lookouts, and admitted to using the guns to steal property from the Flower Club gambling table. Such behavior was improper and should be severely punished. When questioning the defendants, their testimony was evasive. They pleaded guilty and asked for leniency. The court ordered them to be returned to custody and set a date for the official judgment.</p>
<h3>Flower Gambling Rampant Within the Concession; Police Repeatedly Make Arrests</h3>
<p>The Yiji Flower Gambling "factory" in the Shanghai West Special District has, since its establishment, initially harmed only a corner, but now its poison has spread throughout the city. All areas north of the Suzhou Creek are controlled by the gambling den leader, Mao Axiang, and Li Xiaobao's henchman, nicknamed Su Cai Gen Bao, who recruits unemployed vagrants to act as "boatmen," luring people into gambling. Each "tube" of gambling money collected is turned over to the head "tube" through Gen Bao, so the</p>
<p>listening device mechanism</p>
<p>set up by Gen Bao is very powerful. However, its news is extremely accurate, and its dens are numerous, so it has not been caught yet. The other day, the Huizi Patrol Station suddenly received an outside phone call saying that a robbery had occurred at No. 94, Lane 75, Tiantong Road. The head detective dispatched detectives Zhao Ziduo and Wang Jinshou, etc., along with Western detectives, to rush to the scene. They entered through the back door of the house and saw many people gathered in the kitchen writing flower gambling slips. Under questioning, Wang Amao, a boatman from Zhenjiang, admitted that he was working for</p>
<p>Su Cai Gen Bao</p>
<p>. The second landlord of the house, Shi Yanqing, also admitted that he should not have rented the house to Mao for gambling and insisted that no robbery had occurred in the house. The detectives then took Wang and Shi, along with four men and women, including Zhou Xiaofu, who were playing the flower gambling game, as well as more than 120 flower gambling slips and gambling money, etc., back to the Patrol Station. They were detained and sent to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning for investigation. The Patrol Station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the case,</p>
<p>submitted evidence</p>
<p>, and Judge Meng, after a clear investigation, sentenced Wang Amao to seven months in prison and Shi Yanxiao to six months in prison. If they chose to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at three yuan per day. The others were each fined thirty yuan, and if they chose to perform labor in lieu of payment, it would be calculated at two yuan per day. The gambling paraphernalia was confiscated. In addition, a man named Xiao Chen, also a boatman recruited by Su Cai Gen Bao, had his agency set up at No. 201, Lane 590, Haining Road. He also hired a Ningbo woman, Cao Wangshi,</p>
<p>to go out and lure people into gambling</p>
<p>. The other day, she was arrested while passing through North Jiangxi Road. Flower gambling slips were found on her, and she was taken to the Huizi Patrol Station. The detective, Ma Bingzhang, was sent to arrest Xiao Chen, but he had already fled after hearing the news. Only Yang Jinbao and Tang Tianlin, who were playing the flower gambling game, were caught. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court along with Cao Wangshi. Judge Meng</p>
<p>conducted a detailed interrogation</p>
<p>and sentenced Cao Wangshi to three months in prison. If she chose to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at three yuan per day. The other two were each fined fifty yuan, and if they chose to perform labor in lieu of payment, it would be calculated at one yuan per day. The gambling paraphernalia was confiscated. In addition, each patrol station in Xinzha, Chengdu Road, Gordon Road, Jing'an Temple Road, etc., has several boatmen luring people into gambling every day, and the number of cases of criminals sent to the court for punishment according to the law is too numerous to record.</p>
<h3>Jewish Immigrant Embezzles Luggage</h3>
<p>Jewish refugees Hu Gao Naotesikante and Luoteweigan Yili arrived in Shanghai by boat on the 7th of this month along with other refugees. Unexpectedly, Luo embezzled and sold Hu's and other refugees' luggage worth 31,000 yuan and fled to Qingdao. Hu and others reported to the General Patrol Station, and detective Kobayashi tracked him down and arrested Luo in Qingdao. On the 28th, Luo was brought to Shanghai and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The Patrol Station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the case was complicated and requested an adjournment for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, he ordered the detention to be continued and the hearing rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the bankruptcy case of Jiande Bank, having read today's report in your newspaper that "the Shanghai First Special District Local Court ruled and announced the bankruptcy of the bank and appointed accountant Li Ding as the bankruptcy administrator," and that "the bankrupt and the bankruptcy administrator colluded with each other, representing untrue debts, hindering the bankruptcy estate, and the rights of bankruptcy creditors, and privately accepting loans and altering accounting books," etc., these words are easily misunderstood. Therefore, I hereby make a clear statement and explain the evolution of the bankruptcy administrator in this case as follows: Jiande Bank was ruled and declared bankrupt on July 24, 1935. At that time, the court appointed lawyer Shen Junru and our accountant as bankruptcy administrators, and the creditors' meeting elected lawyers Lu Shidao and Lu Jia and Yu Yuanxiang as bankruptcy supervisors. Subsequently, the administrators found that the bank's paid-up capital was insufficient, falsely reporting more than 200,000 yuan to the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, from April 1936, they sued the bank's directors to recover the capital, and at the same time applied for the cancellation of the limited company registration. In March 1937, a judgment was made confirming that the bank's directors and supervisors were jointly and severally liable for the capital of 243,300 yuan. On April 27 of the same year, the third creditors' meeting was convened. According to the requirements of the bankruptcy law, the creditors re-elected the bankruptcy administrator. As a result of the voting, Yu Yuanxiang received 453 votes, representing a creditor's amount of 231,851 yuan and 99 cents, and was elected as the bankruptcy administrator. Our accountant immediately reported the meeting to the court. On the other hand, because he had been subjected to various obstacles and attacks when pursuing the capital, he felt that he had barely fulfilled his responsibilities as administrator as a result of obtaining a favorable judgment. Since someone was taking over as administrator, he was eager to be relieved of the heavy burden. Unexpectedly, on June 18 of the same year, he received a court ruling stating that, in addition to lawyer Shen Junru's position as administrator being taken over by Yu Yuanxiang, our accountant's position would continue to be handled. At this point, he had no choice but to continue to serve. This is the evolution of the administrator in this case. As for the various matters reported in your newspaper, our accountant knows nothing about them. We request that your newspaper make a correction to clarify the truth. This is most appreciated.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jiande Bank Bankruptcy Administrator Accountant Li Ding, September 29th,</p>

<h3>On Writing and Association</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Confidence is the cornerstone of success. We know this saying, and we all use it to cope with this storm. We see many works full of anger and hatred printed in books and magazines. These are all records of life's scars, with our tears, our cries, our curses, and many further positive meanings. But I always wonder, I feel that it is not enough; the optimistic and strong atmosphere is always a bit lacking.</p>
<p>Optimistic writing is always difficult to write and the hardest to please. The novels of talented scholars and beautiful ladies inevitably become cliché when they end in reunion. It seems that the deeper the sorrow, the more touching it is. To save effort and please people, everyone chooses to write about the gray and dark, about cruelty, about slaughter, about family destruction, about all inhumane things. We have seen a lot of it. If it is a real feeling, there are plenty of readers who are shocked and shed tears. No one denies this effect: it can stimulate readers, make them remember it deeply, remember the hatred, and wash away the humiliation. But let us not forget that great success has two requirements: one is the stimulation before the determination, and the other is the encouragement during the work. Explaining shame and hatred is just a kind of stimulation, increasing one's determination, but after we have made up our minds, and the work has begun, we should not only reflect on the pain, but also encourage, confidence and pleasure. Tasteless pride often makes a person relax and become negligent, but a constant frown also easily erodes energy. We need leisure and bright joy after labor, and we are also suitable for them.</p>
<p>A group of people embark on a difficult road, without turning back, confidence is a fact. After walking for two years, groping in the dark all night. The sky is about to dawn, and whether to go or not is naturally not a problem. Just keep going! There is no need to say anything more about whether you should go. Even if you tell the ignorant, it doesn't matter, but in the dark night and deep valley, when you see the sunlight coming through the cracks in the rocks, why don't you laugh more wildly, sing loudly, and let the happy air dispel the cold of the night.</p>
<p>Confidence, courage, vigor, steadfastness, joy, all of these describe a kind of interest. When tired, it is a stimulant, and it has a tonic function when it penetrates into the human body. This is by no means just exaggeration and shouting. In judgment, it is optimistic, in substance, it is full, in time, it is immortal, and in space, it is vast. Taken together, these are all interests.</p>
<p>Stimulation is certainly needed in the early stages, but at present, stimulation is definitely not enough. In addition to grief and anger, there must also be encouragement. This so-called association goes beyond the revelation of light or the theme of victory. Analytically, it is the atmosphere that the author first has a correct optimistic consciousness, and then a potential and joyful mind spontaneously arises, and is transcribed through imagery. Although this atmosphere is often related to the theme, in reality, it often encourages people even more than the optimistic theme. It is silent, it is the joyful wave of the author's mind, it can make readers happy, comforted, encouraged, and powerful. You cannot find its shadow in a certain chapter or section. This is the author's mood. On the surface, it is often entrusted to the story, but in fact, behind the story, you can clearly see an author who is brave, vigorous, steadfast, and joyful, with</p>
<p>Even without the current encouragement, Chinese new literature in the past ten years, which has always been stuck with nightmares and groans, is in dire need of this kind of promotion. Grasp the interest of creation, unfold a victorious, joyful, and healthy state of mind, and in addition to encouraging readers, it is also good to lead them to a realm of hope. This is not a good omen, it is just your interest. What you should have is the power of life. After grief and anger, this power cannot be missing for a day.</p>
<h3>Price Control (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>He slowly dragged his unique thick-soled leather boots, following five other people wearing the same uniform, to carry out the duty of maintaining order.</p>
<p>The autumn wind swirled quietly in the street. He raised his head: the gray sky that had not yet completely brightened, the 　　clouds. He took a deep breath, but suddenly a rain hit him in the face, shivering and wanting to vomit, and he barely managed to hold it back by forcing himself to walk straight. He thought: No wonder my mother, who is almost seventy years old, eats noodles every day, so she naturally can't stand it. I know that these noodles are hard and stiff when dry, and slippery and sweet when wet. People in the south may like it for two or three meals, but after seven or eight days, it will make their throats feel clogged. It's just that I only make thirty-odd yuan a month, and I have to support two and a half people, old and young. My mother understands; who is hurting us? The current situation is even more difficult, so she has to endure it, but she is getting thinner and thinner every day. If Little Mao dares to pout again, I'll give that little rascal twenty slaps and let him cry his heart out. It's just that the big and small devils keep saying "Grandma can't stand it," and this time they even brought a basket saying they want to buy cheap rice. Damn it, I'll definitely step on these traitors. It's still my fist that's unlucky; if I hadn't beaten him up just now, he would have run away with me in his clothes... He thought as he walked, indifferent even to the raindrops starting to fall on his head. Then, the little Zhangs in front shouted, and he followed nervously.</p>
<p>"Five or six fifteen-year-old devils are squeezing up, aren't they afraid of dying?" he muttered to himself.</p>
<p>"Old Zhou! Did your Da Mao ask you to buy ×× brand and ×× brand flour again?—Cheaper? He still doesn't want to?" the little Zhangs laughed.</p>
<p>He got annoyed and cursed them inwardly: "You are all my last generation, anyway, it's going to be the same old story: This is inferior goods, didn't the bomb from the South Railway Station almost kill you?——My son also says this to me. Humph!" He stared at them blankly, suddenly felt a sense of suspension, and realized that in order to save the five cents for the tram, he had eaten more of the leftover noodles before coming to work. He forced himself to calm down, rubbed the two coats hanging on his arm against his chest, but ignored them and walked on.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, Little Zhang suddenly clapped his hands and stomped his feet, shouting: "Look, that's strange! There are still stars in the sky, and the Shanghai hairy crabs are already lined up in the street. Wow!" They all looked over together, and sure enough, even the walls of the foreign houses on the corner were full of people, some even holding umbrellas.</p>
<p>They instinctively roared over, scaring them to quickly fall down, and several rice bags also fell into people's gardens. They fled screaming towards East Street.</p>
<p>Zhang Qingui was the first to shout: "Pigs!"</p>
<p>"Pigs! Do you want to eat rice, but not life? Look, the guild hall door is still closed!" The iron door was indeed still quietly closed, but more and more people were gathering in front of the door. Six patrolmen quickly squeezed in to maintain order.</p>
<p>They waved their batons, and a pile of people was finally squeezed into a long string of sausages. Little Zhang was quick and stretched the rope to one side, blocking out a narrow path, allowing them to wait in an orderly manner one by one. Three hundred feet of rope was too short, and people 　squeezed to near the X× Road on the south, and lined up along X× Road to X× Road, and then around X× Road. At the end, they were allowed to join in one by one!</p>
<p>The sky had a sad face, and a drizzle began to fall; a cold wind turned the drizzle into large raindrops pouring down. A thin mist floated on the asphalt road, splashing and flowing. A long line was huddled 　close to the iron railing, under the low wall, and even in the open air, with bags over their heads, lying on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The torrent rushed in the road, and the drains played the music of iron horses clanging. Some children folded the paper wrapping the rice into hats of impermanence and put them on their heads, and the wet paper pasted on their faces formed a terrible mask; but the rain flowed even more ruthlessly from under their jaws to their necks, mixed with sweat and darting through their shirts all the way to the backs of their feet.</p>
<h3>Graduation Issue</h3>
<p>— Shu Ni</p>
<p>When I lifted my head from the desk and looked around the room, I saw this thick graduation issue again. Putting down my pen, I was moved; there was a kind of helpless sadness. This was the work I had put my effort into!</p>
<p>How many nights I rushed to write稿子, and proofread stacks of sample稿 with my friends. I didn't stop until my eyelids were as heavy as lead. Then a burst of yawns, we all laughed easily. The pleasure after the work is completed.</p>
<p>Now, there are still so many typos. I have unspeakable embarrassment. Virtue is a difficult and extremely easy to fail learning, and seriousness is the most difficult. I don't know why, these two days I always think of embroidered pillows.</p>
<p>So, I opened the book. I saw the magnificent school gate, the solemn auditorium, the modern sports hall... The past events that drifted away with the long river of time emerged again. However, I don't want to trouble myself in the memory. Accumulate the anger in your heart, the bomb full of gunpowder will always explode in a certain second.</p>
<p>A comfortable life, poetry-like beautiful days, are all destroyed with the red flames. But, how will we rebuild a new paradise on the ruins? Poor people, have you forgotten? What wind and sand have blinded your eyes?</p>
<p>Turning the pages, I froze. Reflected in my eyes were the photos sandwiched in the black lines, which commemorated the two deceased classmates. Before, I was very unfamiliar with them, and even had no conversation with them, but now, I froze. From the cradle to the grave, is it so short? I have no fear of death, but I love life more. "Living is always admirable, because you can work." There are too many things I want to do.</p>
<p>I looked closely at each familiar face and remembered the many divergent roads lying in front of this generation. In the vast journey, young partners, where are we going?</p>

<h3>Funeral</h3>
<p>— Written by C. Wolfe, translated by Pin Pin</p>
<p>Without a drumbeat, nor a mournful tune,</p>
<p>We moved his remains to the edge of the city;</p>
<p>Not a soldier, in remembrance,</p>
<p>Fired a gun over the hero's grave we dug.</p>
<p>We buried him in the dimness of the dead night,</p>
<p>We opened the earth with bayonets;</p>
<p>The moon emitted a trembling, ghostly light,</p>
<p>The oil lamp dimly shone.</p>
<p>There was no need to coffin him,</p>
<p>Nor did we bury him with bedding;</p>
<p>But he lay sleeping like a warrior,</p>
<p>We viewed his body in military uniform.</p>
<p>We read a short eulogy,</p>
<p>Not mentioning a word of sorrow,</p>
<p>We stared at his face,</p>
<p>Hardly thinking about tomorrow.</p>
<p>Together we dug a narrow grave,</p>
<p>Gently lowered his lonely coffin,</p>
<p>Enemies and strangers will trample this tomb,</p>
<p>And we will go far away at sea!</p>
<p>They will slander his dead soul,</p>
<p>Revile his cold ashes,</p>
<p>But it doesn't matter, as long as he sleeps in</p>
<p>A grave dug for him by his countrymen.</p>
<p>Our great work is not yet complete,</p>
<p>The current task has been completed;</p>
<p>The intermittent gunfire in the distance,</p>
<p>Must be the enemy venting idly.</p>
<p>Slowly and deeply we buried him,</p>
<p>In the beautiful soil acquired with his flesh and blood;</p>
<p>We do not inscribe a line of inscription, nor erect a stone tablet!</p>
<p>We leave only glory to accompany him.</p>

<h3>Double Tenth Festival First-Run Film Preview</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival is coming in the shortest possible time. At that time, Shanghai's cinemas will inevitably select a few of the most exciting films to show. Now, let the author report to you fans a few of the ones I know. (National films are temporarily missing)</p>
<p>Nanjing will show "The Four Feathers," produced by United Artists, a complete natural five-color film directed by Alexander Korda, starring John Clements and June Duprez. This film is extremely grand and is a great film that inspires people's patriotism.</p>
<p>Da Guangming will show "Juarez," produced by Warner Bros., starring the famous stars Paul Muni and Bette Davis. This film is a palace history film, depicting the life of the Mexican President Juarez, who led the resistance war and finally achieved the great achievement of restoring the country with extreme perseverance and perseverance. Judging from the past achievements of the two leads, this film will undoubtedly arouse the love of fans.</p>
<p>(Note that the above two films are exactly what we need in the current situation.)</p>
<p>Da Shanghai will show "Sweethearts," produced by MGM, a complete five-color film, co-starring the famous singing stars Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. This film was previously shown at an increased price at the Nanjing Grand Theater. It is an extremely perfect music and art film; if we say that the above two films are hard, then this film should be considered soft.</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival film at Guotai has not yet been decided. I guess it will probably be one of the two films "Frais de St. Cyr" and "Union Pacific." The first film is starred by Ke Mao Kantong, Laurent Tuodan, and Qixi Fulai. The plot describes the heroic deeds of the French Army. As for "Union Pacific," it is co-starred by Bai Peilan Stanwei and Zuo Mikeley. The scene is quite grand, and the plot is also quite tight.</p>
<p>In short, the above films are all worth watching. By the way, let me say one more thing here, the "Four Feathers" in Nanjing has been filmed as a silent film before, and at the time of the performance, this film had already achieved great success.</p>
<h3>Pingju Talents Come in an Endless Stream</h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>— Huangjin Invites Wang Yurong</p>
<p>After the golden autumn wind, the Shanghai theater world suddenly tends to be prosperous. The renovated Huangjin and Gengxin theaters have widely invited famous Peking Opera actors. The first batch of the four famous female performers of the Gengxin stage met with the people of Shanghai yesterday. After the performance, Tan Fuying will continue to take the stage; Huangjin Theater, Song Dezhu and Wu Yanheng will perform for a month. After that, after much consideration, they have invited female performer Wang Yurong, as the main character for Huangjin's invitation to actors. The agent went north a few days ago to invite her, and there is also talk of inviting the famous young actor Yu Zhenfei. They are expected to come to Shanghai around the ninth month of the lunar calendar. The male lead will be played by An Shuyuan, who has already been invited by Huangjin and is now in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wang Yurong was born on the banks of the Qinhuai River, that is, Wang Yanfang, who was selected as the Queen of Songs in the Confucius Temple in those years. In 1934, she went north to study under the old actor Wang Yaoqing. Although Yaoqing has many students, most of them were taught by Wang's senior disciple Cheng Yuqing. Yaoqing especially loves Yurong, so Yurong is the only female actor who has been personally taught by Yaoqing. Yurong is talented and intelligent, and her voice is especially sweet and bright. In addition, she is diligent in learning. After several years of training by Yaoqing, her artistic skills must be considerable. A certain Pingju talent from the south once told me: "Master Wang (referring to Yaoqing) gave all his brain juice to Yurong alone, so Yurong's achievements can be higher than her peers." I have learned that Yurong's momentum in the old capital is already higher than that of Zhang Eyun and Xin Yanqiu, and is even comparable to Xue Yanqin in those years. Whenever she performs, it is always sold out, and she is calling with real art despite being a female actor. This time, she has been invited by Huangjin, and there will definitely be a lively scene at that time.</p>
<p>Improved Ping Opera</p>
<h3>Ms. Jin Suqin's Autobiography: Fourteen Years of Acting (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Leng Fang</p>
<p>— And Her Dedication to Improving Peking Opera</p>
<p>Reforming Peking Opera is what I consider to be the most meaningful and interesting endeavor. Drama, as an important part of the cultural sector, must naturally advance with the times. Although Peking Opera is an old art form, at the very least, in terms of the script, we can use the "old bottle, new wine" approach to infuse it with contemporary consciousness and make improvements. This is both possible and necessary. Previously, Mr. Ouyang and I collaborated. Under his direction and writing, we performed five plays successively: "The Fisherman's Sorrow," "Liang Hongyu," "The Peach Blossom Braid," "Yang Guifei," and "New Jade Hall Spring." The general process was as follows: in terms of performance, the scripts contained new ideas, the stage settings were also slightly modified, and actors, in addition to singing and acting, also emphasized the understanding and expression of the characters' personalities. Great attention was also paid to the three-dimensionality of the stage, scenery, and new-style lighting. In terms of organization: actors were all trained beforehand, a directorial system was implemented for rehearsals, prompters were entirely eliminated, and backstage was divided into general affairs, stage management, performance, costume, and prop departments, with an emphasis on maintaining order through strict regulations. Although this was only an initial attempt and the performance period was only two months, I sincerely hope to have the opportunity to continue striving forward along this path.</p>
<p>Filming Movies</p>
<p>Last winter, Yihua Film Company invited me to film a movie, a costume drama called "Chu Overlord." Originally, I was very interested in movies and had wanted to make one as an experiment. However, after filming "Chu Overlord," I felt that this work was really impossible, too hard. At that time, it was the dead of winter, and working overnight in the freezing cold studio was truly bone-chilling. Also, I was performing at the "Golden" theater every night, and I didn't have enough time or energy to cope. As a result, many of my shots were cut, and it ended hastily. I was really dissatisfied with this movie. I hope to have enough time and a meaningful script in the future to make a better movie.</p>
<p>General Thoughts</p>
<p>I believe that performing Peking Opera requires real skill, otherwise it is difficult to sing well. Even when performing reformed Peking Opera, one must have a solid foundation. The most difficult problem in the reform work is the lack of playwrights, and there is a great shortage of scripts. This is because playwrights in the field of Peking Opera must have deep experience, new ideas, and be good at literature. Otherwise, even if the script is well-written, it may not be suitable for stage performance; and scripts that are suitable for performance may lack sufficient contemporary awareness. This is definitely not an easy task. Another observation: pure Peking Opera may as well be preserved by traditional performers. Southern Peking Opera should be developed as much as possible into reformed plays that are half-sung and half-acted—but definitely not plays with elaborate stage machinery. There are already many comrades in our old opera circle who have changed their thinking, are able to write their own scripts, and sympathize with the reform work. If everyone can work hard together, I believe that this reformed Peking Opera will definitely achieve the greatest success.</p>

<h3>Dance Hall Sketches</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>Star Six Diary, Episode Thirteen: Mi Ling</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, it's already the Mid-Autumn Festival. I've been extremely busy this past week. I watched Song Dezhu's "Little Cowherd," and I was busy listening to Zhao Yurong, Wu Suqiu, Liang Yunqiu, and others in "Four or Five Flower Caves." Plus, I had to attend social events at the host's house and banquets at other people's houses. I barely had time to go to the dance hall, which I usually love. I heard that a charity tea dance will be held this Sunday at the Metropolitan, and there will be some entertainment programs, such as Jin Lili, Mei Yunyun, Ying Meihua, and others singing Peking Opera. Since Lili knows me as her nominal teacher, she naturally asked me to find her a qin player to warm up her voice. I arranged one for her yesterday, so I have to go to the Metropolitan to give her the news. If I go to the dance hall to talk to a dance girl, it seems a little impolite to go to her seat to talk. I have to dance with her once. As we were talking and walking, I suddenly heard a voice like an oriole calling out "Teacher." I turned around and saw that Mi Ling was dancing with a Buddha-like guest. This guest also smiled when he saw me and called out "Teacher" in a soft voice, which made me laugh first. It's really "humility from above, undeserved." How should I respond? Mi Ling has the reputation of a female poet, she is elegant and beautiful, and her behavior is dignified. She dances standard dances very well. Although I have not read her poems, I can tell from her conversation that she is not a mediocre person. As for me, I don't know how to write poetry at all, so how can I be a teacher to a poet? As for this disciple who looks like a Laughing Buddha, I am even more unworthy of the title.</p>
<p>The character "宓" (Mi) looks like "密" (Mi). One pronunciation is "Fu," I jokingly said to Mi Ling: Your surname should be read as "宓 (Fu)," which is a good medicine, "茯苓" (Poria cocos). Your surname should be read as "宓 (Mi)," the "secret order (密令)" during military periods is the most important. No wonder you are so popular and busy, and you are even involving two gentlemen with glasses and a Laughing Buddha in the hustle and bustle. This is your magic!</p>
<p>Speaking of learning to write poetry, I think it's not necessary. Since ancient times, poets have been poor and destitute, and talented and beautiful girls often have short lives. This is my superstition. Moreover, poetry is only for cultivating one's temperament, and it has no practical use at all. Reading should be for understanding principles, that is, we should know how to be a person. But it's always good to read poetry in one's spare time, but you should be careful not to overwork your mind.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Opera World</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Actors and Opium</p>
<p>Speaking of which, smoking opium does indeed have considerable benefits for actors. It is often said that their voice is their capital, which shows how important the quality of their voice is to their lifelong honor and disgrace, and their livelihood. After actors pass the difficult stage of voice change, from adulthood to middle age, they are most easily tempted by various external influences. The first is the problem of lust, which is costly, harmful to the body, and damaging to their reputation. However, opium is most likely to ruin one's blood. Once addicted, the body weakens, essence and blood are depleted, and the problem of sexual desire is greatly diminished. Going out also requires energy, patience, and the willingness to endure hardship in order to achieve one's goals. If one has a beloved, but then develops an addiction, when the craving comes, one's body is no longer one's own, and one can't even lift one's legs. Even if a celestial beauty is standing in front of you, you won't have the strength to reach out and pull her hand. So, anyone who gets addicted to this habit will not even think about it. The loss of essence and blood most affects the voice, making it dry or hoarse and unable to produce sound. Another thing is that colds and coughs can also make the voice hoarse, or even cause shortness of breath and rapid breathing, often interrupting a sentence several times. If this happens on stage, the audience will definitely boo or chase you off the stage. However, opium is most effective in stopping coughs, and those who smoke it do not suffer from minor ailments for many years. Furthermore, according to insiders, if one has satisfied their craving at home for half an hour before going on stage, the effect of the opium is still strong, one's breath is sufficient, and the voice is round and smooth. If it is not a full-length play like "Visiting Mother," which lasts at most three or four quarters of an hour, then one can definitely be full of energy and consistent from beginning to end, and cope with the play successfully. What is most feared is satisfying one's craving and then sitting backstage for two or three hours before going on stage. By then, the effect of the opium has worn off, the throat is itchy, and although one wants to exert oneself, one cannot muster any energy. (110)</p>
