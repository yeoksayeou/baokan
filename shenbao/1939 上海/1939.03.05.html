<p>社評</p>
<h3>現階段的巴勒斯坦問題</h3>
<p>英國召集的巴勒斯坦問題會議，自二月七日開慕以來，差不多有一個月了。因爲英國對阿拉伯人始終不肯放棄巴勒斯坦的統治權，對猶太人始終不肯實行旦爾福宣言，故雖討論多時，不但毫無結果，反而陷入僵局了。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦原是古代的猶太國，後爲土耳其所併吞。當歐洲大戰的時候，巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人聽信了英國肯給予獨立的諾言，便脫離了土耳其的覊絆。大戰結束以後，它被劃爲國聯委任統治地，由國聯委任英國統治。可是英國統治以後，對阿拉伯人不但自食前言，反運用種種政治上的設施，給他們以種種壓迫。在另一方面，又利用猶太人的「復國主義」，根據貝爾福宣言，佯許猶太人在巴勒斯坦建立「民族的故鄉」，鼓勵猶太人移殖巴勒斯坦，製造猶阿兩民族間的仇視衝突，以轉移阿拉伯人對英國的仇視，而鞏固她在巴勒斯坦的統治。猶太人在這種鼓勵之下，便由世界各地回到他們的祖國所在地居住。在德國發動排猶運動以後，移往的更爲踴躍。自一九二零年到現在，猶人絡續移往的已達四十萬人，的佔阿拉伯人的百分之四十五。這些猶太人都刻苦耐勞，又善居積，故巴勒斯坦的許多產業，己漸漸移入他們的掌握。阿拉伯人對此，異常恐慌，由恐慌而仇視，由仇視而引起强烈的反猶運動。近年以來，猶阿兩族的衝突，無時或已，原因在此。</p>
<p>英國過去是一向利用這兩種民族間的衝突，以鞏固她對巴勒斯坦的統治的。可是到了最近，這兩民族間的鬥爭，已給法西斯意大利所利用，作爲威脅英國，爭取地中海的霸權，和擴大北菲殖民地的工具了。原來巴勒斯坦雖地瘠民貧，在商業上無甚重要，但對於英國軍略上的地位是很重要的。英國要保證她和近東及北菲殖民地交通的安全，是不得不用大力來經營的。因爲它跟蘇彝士運河密接着，在英國和近東以及北菲殖民地的聯繫上，它正握着重要的樞紐。意大利併吞了阿比西尼亞，得勢於紅海，鼓動西班牙內亂，在地中海取得了優勢之後，英國和近東及北菲殖民地的交通，大受威脅，於是便急於在巴勒斯坦境內開鑿一條運河，起自地中海沿岸的海法港，經過的丹河和死海，迄紅海的阿卡巴港，以備地中海一旦發生戰爭，蘇彝士運河即使被毀或封鎖，她和近東的海道交通，仍可維持。此外，她又準備建築一條鐵路，自阿卡巴港通到瑪安城，和摩蘇爾區域通至梅第納的鐵道相連接，俾摩蘇爾區域的煤油運輸管即使被毀，煤油的輸送，仍得照常維持。這樣，英國在近東和北菲的地位，將日益鞏固，而巴勒斯坦可始終依附於英國了。</p>
<p>這個計劃，對法西斯意大利爭霸地中海和擴張北菲殖民地的野心是有相當威脅的，所以最近她一再鼓動阿拉伯人的反英運動，又聯合德國，擴大排猶運動，使猶太人更感到沒有國家的痛苦，因而更努力於復國運動，藉以間接增加猶阿間的仇恨，使英國的計劃，難以實現。英國看到了這一點，深知倘要再利用過去的政策，則適足以替法西斯意大利造就機會，於是想放棄以前的政策，遂召集巴勒斯坦的猶阿代表，舉行會議，俾兩民族各提出主張，從而覓取妥洽的方案，以免自身受給。可惜英國沒有放棄巴勒斯坦統治權和實施貝爾福宣言的决心，故討論了一個多月。還是毫無結果。我們相信解鈴還是繫鈴人，英國的紳士們。應當澈底放棄以往的政策，信守諾言，根據公平的原則、覓取解决的途徑，扶助他們建立獨立自由的國家。這樣才能予侵略者對地中海和北菲的覬覦以重大的打擊！</p>
<h3>第三次全全國敎育會議　蔣委員長發表訓詞　以全副熱誠負起救國建國責任　革命三民主義為敎育最高基凖　倡導全國堅定抗建精神與意志</h3>
<p>（重慶）蔣委長在第三决全國敎育會議訓詞、議長副議長、各位先生、我們第一次全國敎育會議、是民國十七年五月召集的、第二次敎育會議是民國十九年四月召集的、這次全國敎育會議、距離前屆的會議已有八年餘、會議的舉行、正在我們全國抗戰建國積極進行的時期、所以使命是特別重大、道一决敎育會議的任務，當然是要檢討敎育界的現狀、研究改進或補救的辦法、解决敎育上當前種種困難問題、但我所要求於到會諸君的、更望諸君確認中華民國此時之需要、把握住敎育上的中心問題、以全副的熱情和眞成、負起救國建國的責任、這就是說我們要認定敎育上一定的目標、要以革命救國的三民主義、爲我國敎育的最高基準、實施抗戰建國綱領、創造現代國家的新生、</p>
<p>發達經濟增强武力</p>
<p>我常說、現代國家的生命力、由敎育經濟武力三要素所構成、敎育是一切事業的基本、亦可以說敎育是經濟與武力　相聯擊的總樞紐、所以必須以發達經濟、增强武力、爲我們敎育的方針、尤其是這個抗戰建國時期、我們必須發展經濟、以充實戰時的國力、以奠立戰後建國的基礎、更必須增强武力、以期一方面克敵制勝、一方面建國建民、我們要由戰時種種艱苦困難的當中、造我們中國爲富有活力、富有前途的現代國家、目前敎育上一般辯論最熱烈的問題、就是戰時敎育和正常敎育的問題、亦就是說、我們應該打破所有正軌的制度呢、還是保持着正常的敎育系統而參用非常時期的方法呢、關於這一個問題、我個人的意思、以爲解决之道、很是簡單、我這幾年來常常說、「平時要當戰時看、戰時要當平時看、」我又說、「戰時生活、就是現代生活、現代時期無論個人或社會、若不能買行戰時生活、就不能存在、就要被人淘汰滅亡、」我們若是明瞭了這一個意義、就不必有所謂常時敎育和戰時敎育的論爭、我們因爲過去不能把平時當作戰時看、所以現在纔有許多人不能把戰時當作平時看、這兩個錯誤、實在是相接而至的、我門决不能說、所有敎育都可以還世獨立於國家需要之外、關起門戶不管外邊環境、甚至外敵壓境了、還可以安定如故、以至不緊張起來、但我們也不能說、因爲在戰時所有一切的學校課程和敎教育去令都可以擱在一邊、因爲在戰時了、我們就把所有現代的靑年、無條件的都從課室實騐室研究室趕出米、送到另一種境遇裏、無選擇無監督地去做應急的工作、我們需要兵員、必要時、也許耍抽調到敎授、或大學專科學生、我們需要各種抗戰的幹部、我門不能不在通常敎育系統之外去籌辦各種應急人才的訓練、但同時我們也需要各門各類深造的技術人才、需要有專精研究的學者、而且允其在抗戰期閒、更需要着重各種基本的敎育、</p>
<p>節約刻苦擴大效果</p>
<p>我們為適應抗戰需要符合戰時環境、我們應該以非常時期的方法來、達成敎育本來的目的、運用非常的精神來擴大敎育的效果、這是應該的、譬如我們各級學校、在戰時要力求設備方面的節的、起居方面的簡單和刻苦、我們從前人畫荻敎子、用如此簡單的敎具、也可以敎出有名的人物、有如變螢映雪、也不廢讀書、這是我們戰時師生所應該取法的、以及學生訓練方面、課目範圍的擴大、興不必要課程的减少、社會敎育方面、對於學校機關人力的儘量利用、這些問題、可以舉一反三、不能枚舉、總而言之、我們切不可忘記、戰時應作平時看、切弗爲應急之故、而就不計了基本、我們遭一戰、一方面是爭取民族生存、一方面就要於此時期中、改造我們的民族、復興我們的國家、所以我們敎育上的若眼點、不僅在戰時、還應當看到戰後、我們要估計到我們國家、要成爲一個現代的國家、那麼我們國民的知識能力、應該提高到怎樣的水準、我們要建設我們國家、成爲一個現代的國家、我們在各部鬥中、需要有若干萬的專門學者幾十萬、乃至幾百萬的技工和技師、更需要幾百萬的敎師和民衆訓練的幹部、這些都要由我們敎育界供給的、這些間題、都要由我們敎育界來解决、關於敎育上一切具體節目的問題、我不能够提出來討論、</p>
<p>堅定全國抗建意志</p>
<p>在我希望諸君、着眼到最基本的一點、這就是要堅定我們全國抗戰的意志、建立我們積極建國的精神、允其要時時刻刻提高我們民族固有的道德、大家都知道、我們是物質條件一切欠缺的國家、處在這樣危險困難的時期、還要負起道樣非常巨大的責任、若不是以精神勝過物質、就不能求得抗戰的勝利、若不用我們間有的道德和革命的精神、若不由精神產生出努力、創造出物質、就沒有法子達到建國的成功、况且敵人現在所千方百計以求的、是要打擊我們的精紳、壓倒我們的精神、消滅我們民族固有的道德、和革命的精神、使我們民族生命、無所寄托、因此目前較急的需要、無過於精神的振作與集中、最近中央提出國民參政會、决定實施精神總勵員、目的就在强化我們全國的精神、以負起抗戰建國的時代使命、不久就要定出辦法、推行全國、這一個重大責任、希望我們全國敎育界人士、毅然担當、以身作則、來倡導各界、普遍力行、古人說、「化民成俗、其必由學」、敎育界的一言一動、無不影饗於社會的風氣、這幾十年來的革命運動、沒有一次不由於敎育界熱烈倡導、以至於發揚光大的、今天更不是起技振敝的問題、而是得之則存、失之則亡的問題、我們必須發揚我們固有的精神道德、激起全民族的獨立自尊性、喚起全民族對侵略我們滅亡我們的暴敵、有同仇敵愾的犧牲心、樹立起全民族對革命前途和國家的將來、有深切的自信心、從而鼓勵起、向前進取、積極奪鬥的决心，而後我們這一個廣大悠久的民族、欃能從萬苦千辛中、孕育出光明燦爛的新生命、我以爲我們國家到了今天、一羣敎育者的生活、應該再不是從前閉戶敎書優游目得的清閑生活、敎育者不應該祗是按照學程傳習知識、視為個人的一種生活根據、或私人職業、今天的敎育家應該自認爲衝鋒折銳的前綫戰士、應該自認爲移風易俗的社曾導師、應該自認爲華路藍縷的先驟、今天我們再不能附和過去誤解了許久的敎育獨立的口號、使敎育者自居於國家法令和國家所賜予的責任以外、而成爲孤立的一羣、</p>
<p>敎育軍政　打成一片　我以爲到今天、我們來談敎育、應該使敎育和軍事。政治。社會。經濟相貫通、怎麼樣使敎育和軍事相貫通呢、我們要造成所有學生都有衛國自衛與自治治國的意識和本能、未及齡的學生、要使長成起來、能服國家的兵役、適齡的學生、要使國家必要微調時就能應微入伍、沒有徵調時、要使每人有一種可以擔任抗戰有關工作的技藝、怎麼說敎育與政治相貫通呢、學記上說「爲之師然後爲之長、」古代的師資、就是各層政治幹部所從出、今天我們的敎育者、也應當擔任起訓練民衆和組織民衆的責任、怎麼說敎育和社會相貫通呢、近來常聽到學校敎育人員、視兼辦社會敎育爲畏途、我以爲經費。時間。精力、固然耍有適當的考慮、但是根本說起來、學校敎育决不能離開社會、古人說「相輔而善爲之摩、」不要說我們社會一般同胞、愚昧痛苦、我們决不忍漠視、就是爲達成敎育的目的、勿使近墨者黑、應該開發社會民衆的國民常識、以改善學校的環境、怎麼說敎育和經濟相貫通呢、這更是我們建國計畫中一個要點、我們耍根據國家經濟建設的需要、敎授國民重勞動、能生產、尤其是鼓勵創造的能力、一切敎育計畫、要與經濟計畫相配合、而後我們敎育纔能成爲現代國家生命力所山造成的一個因素、（未完待續）（四日電）</p>

<h3>英政府承諾扶助阿族獨立　十八年前重要文件發表　巴勒斯坦會議依然僵局</h3>
<p>倫敦　英政府應阿刺伯人一再之申請、昨日將一九一五年七月及一九一六年三月間、英國高級委員麥瑪洪與米加酋長胡辛尼交換之書札十件付之公佈、共中表示英政府在一九一五年即貝爾福宣言之前兩年、已經允諾扶植阿刺伯國之建立、此項書札幷附有戰前小亞細亞之着色地圓、書札中激重要者有兩件、一爲一九一五年一月十四日胡辛尼代表阿刺伯人所提之六種建議、</p>
<p>（一）英國承認阿刺伯國、其疆界自波斯邊界至印度洋迤南之巴斯拉灣、惟亞登及紅海迤西以及地中海沿岸不在其內、英國承認設阿刺伯國王、（二）英國在阿刺伯亨有一切經濟事業之優先權、（三）軍事上互助、如一旦開戰、必須得英國及阿刺伯雙方同意、始能媾和、（四）如兩國之一捲入侵略衝突、則另一國至少應保持中立、（五）英國同意廢除其他各國在阿刺伯各國所享特權、幷協助阿刺伯國王政府、以國際協定推進其工作、（六）第三四兩款、其有効期爲十五年、第二封重要書札、爲經過多次通訊往還、麥瑪洪於一九一五年十月二十四日所致胡辛尼之信、其內容包括下列五要點、（一）英國願意承認及贊助米加酋長所指定之阿刺伯區域之獨立、（二）英國願意保護聖地、防止一切外來攻擊、幷承認其不可侵犯性、（三）在適當環境之下、英國願意允許阿刺伯人之全權、幷贊助其組織最適合之政府、（四）阿刺伯人同意僅接受英國之指導及建議、同時爲建立良好行政制度起見、僅任命英人担任顧問、（五）至於伊拉克京城與巴期拉間之維辣德區域、阿刺伯人承認英國之特殊利益、同時爲防衛外來之襲擊、保證人民之福利、促進雙方之經濟利益起見、英國應保持特殊行政制度、</p>
<p>麥瑪洪幷解釋此項五點計劃、謂其可以證明英國之同情、而成爲堅强持久聯擊、共最近效果、即爲排除土耳其勢力、解放土耳其奴治下之阿刺伯民衆云、（四日海通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據此問聲稱、今新全文中所含文字之不同、皆屬純粹口頭上之關係、阿刺伯人爭稱麥瑪洪爵士所言英國準備承認並贊助之阿刺伯獨立、巴力斯坦亦在其界限之內、此間政界則切言英政府從事承認此點、英國之見解已於邱吉爾在一九二二年任殖民大臣時聲明之、其言日、諾言屬於一種保留、位於大馬色區以西叙利亞土地數部分不在其內、英政府常視此項保留包括維萊葉特。貝魯特。及耶路撒冷獨立的散嘉克全部、故的丹河以西巴力斯坦全部、實不在麥瑪洪爵士質言之內云、又一九三七年七月閒爵士本人致函報界、聲明渠未擬將巴力斯坦包括於渠向阿刺伯人所作質言之內、此節亦屬重要也、（三日路透電）</p>

<p>義烏景象　義烏城並不繁盛，全城僅在郊外的車站旁有二家旅舍，設備都很簡陋。義烏縣與東陽永康相連，其北爲諸暨，西南爲金華及武義兩縣，浙贛鐵路自諸曁至金華之段，適經其縣治的中部，所以就地勢上講。義烏縣居其中，屬於很重要的地區。全縣面積有四四四一公方里，人口總數却有二九九二三九人，所以其平均每方里的人口密度，較之諸曁多七人，爲六十八人。義烏農民有八萬七千四百人，每年的普通農作特產額爲二五六五二五〇担，不及諸曁之半，但該縣的農村副業較爲發達，如製造靑糖，養蜂爲最主要，其决特殊農產品方面，烟草可年產三萬七千餘祖，歷年產四萬五千二百餘担，大部屬輸出的。壯丁訓練亦在積極中，全縣壯丁共有五萬九千餘，受謂的估計已佔三分之一，記者訪問縣區民衆敎育館，詢以地方民衆對於抗戰方面的祖織情形，據告自八一三滬戰爆發後，曾組辦戰時智識班，召集民衆參加聽講，指示戰時民衆應具智識。關於四鄉的戰時工作，除由各分館主持外，城區亦派員分區宣傳。義烏的民敎館，設施頗佳，在館前有一壁報，報告當日的簡要戰况，館後空地築一體育塲，設有籃球及小足球之類，以供民衆作業餘的運動，館內有一小型的講廳，樓上則設有圖書館，記者上去參觀，地位很寬大，可容四五十人之閱覽，館中藏書頗多，並有讀報處，架上陳列各地出版的報紙及有關抗戰的雜誌很豐，有職員二人專理借書等事務。　　東陽一瞥　在義烏逗留二夜，卽乘汽車至東陽縣，義東公路共長一八·二公里，路面闊而平坦，所有路橋亦建造極固，車行的二小時即抵東陽站。東陽全縣面積雖有九五八五公方里，但多山地，故不宜耕植，全縣人口四十六萬六千四百餘，每方里的平均人口密度僅四十九人。人民之從事於工藝者頗多，的九萬人，因東陽縣農村子弟向精工藝，故人民在外省從事工藝者如造紙·縫工·水泥·紡織。者極多。且遍於南洋各地，可見該縣人民頗富冒險的精神。東陽縣農業並不發達，全縣普通農作物年產額僅一百萬担左右，故很少輸出，而特殊農產品如茶，每年的產量亦有一萬擔左右。鄉間農民的副業則以醃製火腿著稱，故東陽的火腿實較優於金華，每年輸往各地者爲數殊鉅，據當地人云，自戰事爆發以來，本縣的茶產及火腿二項，仍爲出口的大宗，因交通方面的略受阻碍，地方上已有運輸與產銷合作社的組立，帮助農民運銷。東陽縣最繫盛之區，便是一條長街，直通至縣政府，但街道很狹小，雖在白天，街上亦很黑暗，街道是用石面舖或的，高低不平，城中有一個縣立的初級中學，吾們去參觀，該校有學生三百餘，敎師二十多位，師生對抗戰的工作，很具合作，校內有戰事消息的佈吿牌，有宣傳及救護等工作。記者回來的時候，見街口上擠立了一堆人，在讀着一張才版的戰訊壁報，顯明的紅字大標題，加着大圈子，够引人注意，這種壁報隨時得着緊要的消息，便立刻出版，消息的來源是從各地的廣播電台收聽來的，所以很正確而敏捷，可使全城人都知道，這種經濟有効的報導方法，在小城市中似乎特別的適宜，的確是很可取而値得模仿的。　　遍地歌聲「保衛大浙江」這一支歌曲，似乎每個浙江人都會唱的，吾們到處都可以聽到有人在唱着或哼着：「拿起那殺人的鐮刀斧頭土砲，來保衛吾們父母兄弟姊妹·生命財產·田園土地·武裝保衛大浙江。這不禁使人敬佩這些靑年救亡宣傳團的力量來，他們居然敎會了每個浙江人唱這支歌，這精神是可貴的。記者從東陽至方岩的汽車上，有幾位靑年學生，很有勁唱着這支歌，同車的人都很滿意，沒有人出來阻止。去方岩的目的是在一游壽山與五峯書院，方岩屬永康縣，欲至方岩者，須先至世雅汽車站，隨後轉車而達。方岩平時是一個靜僻之地，沒有市鎭，當地的居民大都是很貧苦的，田地都在山上，灌溉絕不方便，婦女都賴着製傘，刺繡等手工業來維生，該地在每年夏歷的八九月間，方巖山的胡公廟，有一個香汎，浙東西各縣以及國贛邊境遠道來此進香者，接踵摩肩，據說每日來山者，數必千人，故岩下大街，旅舍有十餘家，香舖數十家，平日大都空閉，但自戰事以來，因交通不便，香客也都裏足不往，同時每年數萬元的糜費，亦可因是而節省了。記者宿於五峯書院招待所，此係前浙省名勝保管委員，出資修建的，五峯書院係依石洞的缺處建成，所以在二樓並無犀頂，僅由着天然的洞石爲遮掩，據云戰前每夏來此避暑的人很多。記者向該所管理員，詢問地方居民對於抗戰的動態，據述除縣府派員來宜傳外，當地因人口極少且無任何組織，惟大家對於救國的情緒亦頗激烈。决日返世雅，候車至永康，永康全縣有人口二十萬，其中壯丁有五萬二千餘名，佔全人口四分之一强，地方當局正在積極的抽調及訓練，永康人民，大部從事農業，據縣府的調查，現有農民六萬九千人，從商的極少，僅八千五百五十四人，永康人民一般的智識水準很高，在城區的居民大都進過識字學校，並且全縣的失學兒童亦少，學齡兒童五六六三三個中，就學的已佔大多數有三二八四三人，有尙縣立初級中學一所，分爲六學級，有學生二百數十人，師範科四十餘人，全校敎師二十人。（未完）</p>

<h3>上海敎育界改革敎育意見　關於國語科改革的諸問題（二）</h3>
<p>— 楊晋豪</p>
<p>（四）敎材要有單元的組合、不但可以引起學者聯想的興趣、並且可使學者得一完整的知識、但像「新中華國語」以文體爲標準而分單元、却是不大好、因爲學者在某一個時期中儘贖着三四篇同類文體的文章、毫無調劑、往往會感到非常乏味、敎育部規定高中國文要照文學史系統編製、那末便得以文學史爲標準而分單元、這困難也很多、因爲選材自古而今、文體深淺與學級程度倒置、是一種不便、同時爲了拘泥於文學史的系統、使學者沒有機會精續範圍外的名文、也似缺少調劑、普通國語編製、大都以問題爲標準而分單元、這是比較最適宜的辦法、把環繞於某一問題的各體名文組成一單元、使學者得以透激理解這一問題、旣有興趣、叉便記憶、而且也可藉此體會各種不同的寫作或表現方法、至於作爲補充的常識敎材，那末可在文末附以作者小傳、文體說明、或題解、文法、修辭等、倘實使學者得到整個系統的文學史、學術史等知識、那還是另立一科的好、</p>
<p>（五）國語敎材主要的是當做模範文體而精讀的、所以、要是那必需選用的原文有不合文法或文筆拙劣之處、不妨加以改正或潤飾、務使成爲標準文章、若有需要、可在文末爲之註明、同時精讀敎材、須求便於朗誦和熟讀、所以、要是原文太長、又當酌量刪削縮短、此外更得注意、文章的內容、要見解精湛、情緒純潔、精神積極、凡是浮泛。空虛。荒誕。無聊的作品、即會風行一時、也該摒棄、文章的風格、要誠正而尅實雖然也可選用少許諷刺。幽默。浪漫、哀傷的名文、但那刻薄。輕躁。囂張。頹廢的作品、則須排除、</p>
<p>（六）學者在精讀的敎材上所得的知識是有限的、所以另應補充以略護敎材、普通學校是另外指定某種課外讀物、由全級學者統一購備的、我認爲最好把略讀敎材分爲二類、一類可以選用與精讀敎材相關而比較淺顯的文章、編在各課或各單元的後面、使二者有所聯貫、以引起學者的與味、和便於學者的理解、同時由全體同學閱讀後、可作集體的討論、一類則包括若干生要報章、雜誌和單行本、由學者各自認定購備一種、成立一級的流通圖書館互相交換借閱、可使他們費很少的代價、看到很多的書報、</p>
<p>（七）爲節省學者的精力起見、凡生字。難句。典故等以在文後附加註釋爲便、但是有些國語敎本、對於難以索解之點、往往略而不註、或只註出處而不加釋義、結果雖附註釋而其實等於未註、在這裏、要請國語敎本的編者多用點苦功了、或則索性把自己未能透闢瞭解的文章、暫擱不用、同時也要請敎育部國語審查委員們、精細地把訛字。錯註。以及註易不註難的底稿詳細批出，吾則是太爲難了國語敎員了、</p>
<p>三、敎學的方法</p>
<p>關於敎材的釋義講解、分段大意、問題討論等、最好由學者主動、由敎師輔助、以養成學者肯用功夫、尋思索解的習慣、在此、有應注意的幾點、在後提出來談談、</p>
<p>（一）分析著者的身世和歷史背景來探索課文的意義、醫如杜甫「兵車行」若從其生平窮困顚楚、唐玄宗時的窮兵征伐、勞民傷財等方面來闡說說、自然使學者更有興味、更能體會、並且由此也可以進一步說明這一首詩並不是絕對的非戰文學、而是在侵略戰爭下的非戰文章。</p>
<p>（二）展開課文的含義而與新現實相聯繫起來講、譬如墨瞿的「非攻」、戰國策的「　子止楚勿攻宋」（可附以梁啟超的「墨子的環境及共學說淵源」與「墨子之根本觀念——兼愛」爲略讀敎材）、和杜甫的「兵車行」三篇文章、可成一單元、借着它們、可以說明那現代侵略戰爭的罪惡、闡發那須以强硬外交外能制止侵略、和引證那侵略國內的民怨、跟着可再選讀翁照坦的「正義的戰爭」、章炳鱗的「書十九路軍禦日本事」和丁淑靜等的「創建無名英雄墓墓碑歇」、來說明弱小民族反侵略自衛抗戰的必需、來證實在抗戰中因有民衆的奮發、擁戴而能以弱勝强、來激勵畢者不忘雪恥禦侮以及出錢出力、而在抗戰中、又有好幾等樣的人物、有像吳三桂樣的國賊、有像史可法樣的忠臣、也有像閻典史樣的英雄、那末可以選讀「圓圓傳」「圓圓曲」、「致明閣部史可法書」、「復多爾袞書」和邵辰蘅的「閻典史傳」等、近來胡山源先生所著述的「明季忠義叢刊」（其中「江陰義民別傳」巳由世界書局出版）寫出了民間的許多抗戰烈士、可充略讀材料、他如由司馬光的「赤壁之戰」、可以講到聯合戰綫、由司馬遷的「廉頗藺相如列傳、」可以講到團結統一、由左邱明的「越王勾踐滅吳」、可以講到以弱勝强的政治設施、行軍戰術、有許多古文、對於今日的敎訓都是很大的、在敎讀時把文義和現實配合起來、那就更有意義了、（未完）</p>

<h3>滬學生綱球隊　遠征港澳記（一）</h3>
<p>上屆草地網球雙打冠軍李國璠·唐寶嘉·聯合同志韋鎭與。蔡國基·許培之等、利用寒假、特組織上海學生網球除遠征港澳、由唐君担任隊長、一行五人、（許培之因滬江寒假較遲、不克同行、改搭柯立芝總統號於二月四日抵港）、由領隊姜節和率領於本年一月二十六日搭加拿大皇后號輪離滬赴港、本報會贈送球衣、以壯行色、抵港後與該地各球會名將較量、雖勝負參牛、然以一純粹學生網球隊、而有此成績、殊堪嘉慰、該隊巳於上月十八日搭由法郵杜美總統號輪返抵滬上、</p>

<h3>工部局與日方　獲得妥協之內容　要點四款日領發表公報　工部局依然保持警務權　局方並同意添置日捕部日捕</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨（三日）據工部局與警務處高級人員語記者、警務處與日領署警務人員近作會談後、已獲諒解、雙方將合作而遏制公共租界內之恐怖行動、會談中曾討論與上海恐怖罪行猖獗戰鬥之實際辦法、並已同意行動之聯合政策、是項政策之詳則、警務處未予宣佈、蓋警務處感覺在此階段公佈其計劃、僅能助公共租界與他區中之恐怖黨、逃避雙方諒解後將取之任何行動也、會談雖已於星期三日吿終、但預料雙方不久將籌備續開會議、討論與恐怖事件戰鬥之詳則、警界方面近作討論後、昨日午後、工部局總董樊克令曾訪駐滬日領事三浦、有所商談、昨晚八時三十分、日總領署發表公報稱、妥協之「要旨」如次、（一）嚴格厲行規定移交持械罪犯之工部局緊急佈吿、（二）工部局警務處與日憲兵及領署警務部有效的合作、以保護日本國民、並防杜恐怖活動、（三）第二條規定（甲）有效的控制不法份子自黃浦江與蘇州河入公共租界、（乙）公共租界內各重要地點搜查過路華人、（四）警務處日捕部添置人員、公報並稱、除非忠實實行、否則任何協定、僅一紙廢文耳、</p>
<p>大陸報云　工部局與日當局作延長之會議與一再交換牒文後商得妥協、內含之本質與要點、乃爲凡有影響於未享領判權的外僑之案件、工部局警務處保留在公共租界內施行逮捕與厲行法紀之獨有權、昨（三日）報已載牽涉公共租界管理團體與日方之意外事件、和平解决、日本總領事館咋晚八時三十分發表公報、證實已獲得</p>
<p>辛勞從事　之妥協、據日方公報內所含消息、表示工部局依然保全警務權、而局方關於遏制此間恐怖事件方法之政策、將無劇烈更變、昨晚據上海消息靈通各界表示、彼等相信因日方要求而一度威脅公共租界行政完整之意外事件、今已以公共租界與日當局雙方均滿意之態度而吿結東矣、此項妥協、並規定嚴格厲行工部局之緊急佈告、關於此特殊點、</p>
<p>日方公報　稱、上述之工部局佈吿、規定「移交罪犯」、惟昨晚據此問觀察家稱、工部局緊急條例之確實言辭、與閱日方公報所得之印象、稍有不同云、關于此點、佈吿中之一節載稱、「任何人犯危害公共租界內武裝駐軍之罪者、將移交予該有關駐軍」、領濖公報並載稱、今已同意添置警務處日捕部之日捕、另一决非新穎之點、爲警務處與日軍及領署警務部將作有效的合作、並規定在公共租界內</p>
<p>重要地點搜查過路華人、該公報復稱、對於此問題、昨晚始商得最後妥協解决之前、局方與日方代表昨曾二度會唔、午後三時三十分、工部局總董樊克令偕總辦費利浦與副總辦赤木訪晤駐滬日總領事三浦、會談歷七十分鐘之久、日方海陸軍與領署人員忽促商談後、三浦於午後六時三十分偕廣田大佐、與左籐領事等四人、赴工部局答訪樊克令、按自二月十五日日方向局方</p>
<p>請求防杜　恐怖案件而發生之問題、曾一度轉趨嚴重、廢歷兀且卽二月十九日、僞「維新外長」陳籙在共滬寓中被開槍擊斃、三日之後、三浦即偕海陸軍官訪樊克令、要求立刻厲行减絕此種舉動之辦法據公報載稱、局方之答覆「不完全滿意、日方旋於二月二十八日、作第二次外交手續、日方警務當局與警務處首腦人物會談關於所提議的合作之具體而</p>
<p>詳細辦法　此間與日本國內之日人、一度促請使日軍在蘇州河南岸公共租界內自由行動之際、倫敦即宣佈其爲工部局後盾之意向、並堅持公共租界之不可侵犯、但二日前、局方與日方當局在原則上商妥一切、乃免發生危局、昨晚日領署公報批評此次和諧、認爲係「意向誠摯之贊助、局方與日當局合作以維持上海之和平與秩序、吾人殷望因邇來恐怖活動而生之不願有的緊張、將不復起於較光明之上海」云、</p>
<h3>進口輪隻　應受檢疫　港務長發通告　飭輪公司塡報</h3>

<h3>華軍突擊顓橋　浦南日軍被截　日軍千名悉被困阨　浦江南段狀態嚴重</h3>
<p>正規軍四十五旅徐新洲部隊、前晨五時許、向顓橋鎭所駐之日軍突然截擊、日軍均在夢中驚醒、倉忙應戰、一時槍聲大作、密如連珠、後經北橋日軍聞悉、大隊趕到、徐部見任務已畢、即退回原防、是役斃</p>
<p>日兵三名　奪獲步搶二支、我方亦犧牲義士一名、傷二名、其浦南亭林鎭日軍、自遭遊擊隊計敗、並包圍不能脫險、故松江方面、日軍馳援、前日據步行繞道來滬鄕民云、其援軍亦被華方正規軍六十師之部隊攔擊於葉榭附近、及松隱等處、成爲三段、且均遭多量之</p>
<p>華軍包圍　咸成苦戰情形、是以由浦西閔行調日軍三百名、渡浦至南橋、意圖佔南橋以解亭林之圍、詛又爲遊擊隊在南橋市梢堵截、並包抄而斷沿浦後路之蕭塘、正規軍四十五旅徐部、並將浦南塘口閘港杜家行之三崎角要口佔領、出兵威脅、日軍已處於華軍大包圍陣勢中、同時浦西閔行、日軍旣已空虛、而近在咫尺遊擊隊根據地之關港、華方駐軍</p>
<p>實力頗厚　是以侵人浦南而被包圍之日軍、總計在千名左右、上海日軍總司令部、爲欲援救此五段被圍日軍起見、凡南市浦東各地日軍、已經征調一空、黃浦江甫段、由龍華灣起、均成戒嚴狀態中、</p>
<h3>偽幣流入上海　已逾二萬餘元　福建銀行偽幣亦運到與眞票無異但未簽字</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（三日）悉、僞造之中國紙幣、刻正源源流入本市、商人等受害匪淺、聞已運入上海之僞幣、已逾二萬五千元、兩租界警務處已注意及此、刻圖循一切可能的綫索、追究五元僞幣之來源、刻已發現仿造中國農民銀行之僞幣、爲數尤鉅、另一種僞幣、係仿造</p>
<p>中國銀行　之五元與十元票、其數亦衆、福建銀行之僞幣、亦已設法運滬、福建銀行之紙幣、並非僞造、但不値分文、此種紙幣、爲中政府所印者、但未簽字、因注意紙幣上簽字者頗少、且此種紙幣與眞幣形式無異、故其爲害、較僞幣尤甚、福建銀行紙幣之在此間出現、其故尙未得</p>
<p>具體證據　惟衆知此種紙幣、乃中政府所印、且信意欲用作合法之貨幣、並信因戰事爆發、致不能在此種紙幣上簽字、日軍侵入後、此等紙幣、隨被委棄、旋因日軍佔據該區、乃被運出、卒落入不法之徒之手、設法流入上海、惟尙不知此等不法之徒、究爲何人耳、</p>
<h3>日通告各國航輪　辦理登記　英美航商　一致反對</h3>
<p>邇米進出日軍勢力範圍內之各航輪、時遭日方非法扣留或檢查、甚至有擅捕旅客等種種留難情形發生、茲據記者向可靠之外人方面探悉、日方對於英美法等第三國航權、現竟亦進行其逐漸的排除而剝奪之陰謀、日方軍事當局、於最近通吿各國輪船公司、凡行駛長江口之崇明·楊林口·常陰沙·等地點以及內河之吳淞江（即蘇州河）與南黃浦一帶之各國航輪、均須向日方辦理登記、取得派司、方准行駛、日方此項行動、係企圖剝奪第三國在華航權之初步陰謀、英美等各大國航輪公司、現均聯合一致、拒絕日方通吿、决置之不理、並謀防止日方非法留難起見、由英美籍各航商呈請各該本國駐滬領事館報吿、以便轉呈各該本國政府、作有效之措置、</p>
<h3>日方要求增加　日籍關員　普通日員已增加　英美貿易受影響</h3>
<p>關於邇來日方要求江海關再度增加日籍高級關員、及大批日籍普通關員事、雙方交涉、迄已達數月之久、頗爲中外各界所注意、蓋日方此舉、顯欲膨脹江海關之日人勢力、藉以有利日貨傾銷、排除英美等國在華中之貿易、茲聞江海關英籍稅務司羅福德、現已接受日方之一部份要求、新增日籍普通關員十五名、該項新增日關員、係屬外勤事務、派往新恢復之五分卡服務、至於內勤方面之普通日關員、與高級日關員、並未有增加、</p>

<p>日來滬郊游擊隊活躍異常、情勢顯呈緊張、致日軍恐慌萬狀、分別在其佔領區域、調遺兵士、佈置防禦工事、昨日上午十時、日軍携帶洋釘木板、分往南市·閘北·將無人居住之房屋、悉行封釘有人居住者、則在門上以筆畫一暗號、聞日軍此舉、純爲防範游擊隊之潛跡、其恐慌情形、可見一斑、</p>

<h3>中南飯店　昨夜突遭搜查歷時約一小時始畢　並未抄獲恐怖人犯</h3>
<p>公共租界警務處、爲防止恐怖事件之再度發生並維持秩序起見、曾於一週來進行重要搜查、及在邊界區域佈設鐵絲網等實行封鎖、杜絕任何恐怖份子之潛入租界、證諸連日來之恐怖案件之大减、則可知租界常局之對於防範與搜索、固無不竭力以赴也、且慮將施檢查時之時間與地點等之事先外洩、故每以迅雷不及掩耳之手續出之、蓋亦欲防止罪犯等之聞風預逃也、昨日下午九時左右、當夜市正値燈節、而十分熱鬧之際、公共租界警務處全班預備隊與搜查隊探捕、及萬國商團白俄隊、突然接到緊急動員命令、立刻集中、分乘紅色警備車兩輛、迅速出發、直馳至愛多亞路北海路（即俗稱東新橋）口中南飯店下車、當時白俄商團即擔任四週警戒、暫時斷絕交通、並禁止該旅館內旅客等之出入、所有預備隊與搜查隊探捕、亦立即依照編制、分成小隊、開始向該旅館內各層房間搜查、房中旅客、除行李等當然受檢外、卽每人週身亦經搜檢無遺、而對於旅客來歷、更爲注意、歷時一小時許始行搜舉、撤防歸隊、據悉結果並未抄獲物件或與恐怖有關之人犯、</p>

<h3>米價高漲攸關民食　存米足敷需要　暫時不致發生恐慌　市塲價格已至限額</h3>
<p>上海租界以內之民食、經當局與米業團體、通力合作、存米充足、價格穏定、民食無虞、今因受日僞直接向產區鉅量收買影響、以致產地米價抬高、國米來源稀少、市塲價格、漲至十四元限價、荳米業公會、明日到會時、將提出討論、茲誌詳情如下</p>
<p>日偽鉅量直接採辦　荳米業公會、爲調節滬市民食起見、竭力疏通來源、穏定米價、嚴禁投機、操縱屯積、除民國二十六年冬季、戰事初起之際、會一度發生米荒外、迄今年餘、米價始終未逾越每石十四元限價、租界內之存米、恒在五十萬包以上、民食毫無缺乏之虞、自去年秋季起、日僞鉅量向江浙皖三省產米區採辦、由滸浦蕪湖乍浦等口岸、裝日輪北運、總數已逾一百五十萬石以上、</p>
<p>滬市米價漲至限價　產地受日僞鉅量收買之影響、以致存底銳减、價格高漲、今常熟無錫之頭號米、已由每石八九元、漲至十二元餘、販米商人、向該處採辦之米連開支（包括捐稅運費）每石一元半、每石之成本、已迫近十四元、而上海米市塲以前之限價爲十四元、於是販商無利可沽、相率停販、致國米之來源、空前减少、荳米市塲之米價、已至十四元限價、一般屯戶、不允低價出售、各米號零沽、竟有超過限價者、</p>
<p>荳米公會明日集議</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨晤荳米業某領袖、據談上海之米價、最近突然高漲、實係受日僞向產區直接採辦之影響、一般販運商人、限於成本、不允虧本出售、亦係事實、唯一之根本解决辦法、爲取締日僞向產地收買、但在事實上困難已甚、荳米業公會、對於滬市米價之高漲、關於民食前途甚鉅、故將於六日舉行執監委員例會時、提出討論、據本人所知、米價雖漲、幸租界內存米充足、整個民食、不致發生恐慌、</p>
<p>存米足敷應用三月　上海公共租界及法租界內之存米、據統計約有六十五萬包、每包一石二斗半計算、約合八十一萬石、都堆在公共租界各堆棧內、足能維持滬市租界內民食三個月之需、所以目前由產地運抵滬市之米、雖較前稀少、以致價格高漲、但租界內整個民食、暫時决不致發生缺乏恐慌、租界當局、所組織之米糧聯合管理委員會、對於兩租界內之民食、亦决以其全力維持之、務使其不再重演二十六年冬季之不幸事件、</p>
<h3>希輪利物多被扣後　貨物業已起卸　日方諉稱該輪國籍不明　謂須俟查明後方可譯放</h3>
<p>本市五馬路四川路口挪威商華綸洋行代理之希臘輪利物多號、由津裝貨駛滬、於二日晨、在楊樹浦被日海軍扣留、經希領交涉後、所裝貨物、昨日下午、已開始起卸、日方宣稱、須待查明國籍後、方可釋放、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>裝滬貨物開始起卸　希臘商輪利物多號、係由挪威商華綸洋行代理、向行駛滬津航錢、該輪於二日晨、由津駛抵上海、進口後、正擬停靠隆義棧碼頭之際、突遭日海軍方面查扣、迫駛楊樹浦橋江心拋錨、船上所載由津裝滬之豆油大豆棉紗等貨物、亦不准起卸、當經公司據情報請希臘駐滬領事署交涉後、日方對卸貨一節、已表允許、業於昨日下午四時起、由公司派小工開始起卸、預計昨晚十二時前、當可全部卸空、</p>
<p>查明國籍　可獲釋放　日海軍方面、近來對外商輪隻、濫施扣查、已數見不鮮、因之外商方面、均極憤慨、此次利物多輪被扣、日方事前並未宣布扣留原因、希領即經提出强硬抗議、要求立即釋放、以免希商利益、蒙受重大損害、茲經現代社記者、向關係方面探悉、日方發言人於前晚招待外籍記者時、曾宣稱該利物多輪、雖縣希臘旗幟、但眞正國籍、頗有疑點、故須詳細查明、方可釋放、又據公司方面消息。該輪確屬希臘商所有、領事館方面、均有案可稽、絕無假借之處、故預料日方當無扣留而不予釋放之理也</p>

<h3>金融　收兌辦法重提　激起黃金非常漲風　北帮及外銀行不惜重價爭購造成二千二百元之空前高峯</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、驚人之漲風、層出不窮、竟又衝出上月二十七日之二千一百七十一元最高紀錄、驟現二千二百元之空前新高峰、實因當日報載、財部願出相當價値予以收買、加以天津金價聞漲達二千二百三十五元、（一說二千三百元）本市北方投機家聞風四起活動、又來猛進於前、加以某外商銀行搜購於後、故當時銀樓帮雖有供售、但扳價頗夥、故一度漲勢頗銳、卒以二千三百元限價、賣戶蜂湧、且聞其時天津金價亦稍有回挫、故北帮投機商遂來回吐、加以金號曁錢兌業等均代殷富大量趁高脫售、致遂反動下降、終則猛漲四十一元、當日起落極端倏忽、高低差額竟達四十二元、交易極旺、銀樓飾金亦起落不定、大致先漲後跌、終復再升、一日間竟接連變動五次之多、終亦軋漲四元、海關金曁中英純金等略有回昂、</p>
<p>粭赤暗盤橫跳四十一元之鉅</p>
<p>自晨（每條十兩）初開買者頗湧、價遂由二千一百五十元、抬高至六十元光景、方見做開、首見某錢兌業進銀樓帮共百兩、二千一百五十一八元爲開盤價、較上日做高九元、開後因聞天津金價高昂、且外匯報軟、賣戶更缺、而進者益急、遂勁漲不已、某錢兌業叉進銀樓帮百兩、價一躍而爲七十元、（聞以上所進、大致均代外商銀行吸進）機之證券帮進銀樓帮五十兩、價八十元、後某錢兌業再來吸購、其時賣戶益稀、故漲勢加厲、某錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價九十五元、又進銀樓帮五十兩、二百元爲空前最高峯、此後雖某掮客（又代北帮投機商）力進、奈其時二千二百元限價、賣戶湧旺、且獲利出籠者頗不乏人、故遂反動而下、錢兌業售予某掮客五十兩價八十八元、銀樓帮售予某掮客五十兩價八十三元、後錢兌業又售予某掮客五十兩、價七十八元、其時證券帮又來猛吸、故遂重向上升、錢兌業進金號五十兩、價九十元、證劵帮進金號五十兩、價九十二元、此後某銀樓忽來吐售、故父復向下降、某銀樓售予證券帮五十兩、八十五元、又售予證券帮五十兩、爲八十元、後某掮客進錢兌業五十兩、價八十八元、近午錢兌業互做五十兩、七十八元爲午收價、午後首由證券帮進錢兌業五十兩、價二千一百八十五元、後又進某錢兌業一百兩爲八十三元、後錢兌業互做五十兩價七十六元、此後錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩價八十元、繼錢兌業互做五十兩爲八十五元、最後錢兌業進金號五十兩、二千一百九十元爲晚牧價、較上日軋漲四十一元、已速漲二天、共計六十一元、現金號之本牌金售出價二千二百元、收進二千一百八十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金連動五次　終亦加大四元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至八時五十分因烚赤漲勢加厲、故亦漲起二元、迨五分鐘後、因烚赤昂達二千二百元之空前高峯、故亦一躍四元、產生大同行二百二十四元、及新同行二百二十二元之有市以來之最高紀錄、未幾十時正、因烚赤轉跌、故亦掛小二元、十二時二分又回小一元、最後四時二十分復升一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百二十二元、新同行懸二百二十元、收進二百十四元、</p>
<p>英倫純金昨電　突回長半便士</p>
<p>三日倫敦電、英純金每盎司哭回長半辨士、計達七鎊八先令四辨士、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦回高到一千二百十元〇九角、掛牌海關金亦升二厘、計二元三角九分四厘、上海標準標金價亦隨漲三角、計一千二百〇六元二角、</p>
<h3>匯市稍有起伏　結款仍殷英平美緊　英美匯兌連跌兩日</h3>
<p>滙市昨以英美滙率連降二日、致爲豐初開途吿英平美緊、嗣後外行有利復代平津外商銀行猛扒現期英美兩滙、兼各大洋行亞細亞及日工廠等均追隨扒結、致潛勢步緊、計英金一度退爲八辦士一〇九三七五、美滙亦曾軟至十五元八一二五、然卒以外銀行如匯豐等湧塞維持、故結果續告英平美緊、港滙雖華商投機家扒吸、但以外行及華行等供售尙殷、故局勢依然平穩、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期未更、遠期長〇六二五、紐約銀價、仍未更動、倫敦生金回長半辦士、匯兌英對美小三毫、對法跌三生丁、對滬勿動、美對英如舊、對法降〇六二五、對滬縮五分、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行晨開賣價英金八辦士一二五、美滙十五元八四三七五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、開後外銀行雖來猛扒、無如港電拋塞亦殷、故爲狀尙定、港電賣予有利荷蘭英金八辦士一二五、兼又賣予荷蘭安逹美滙十五元八七五、滙豐掛脾及白銀平衡稅揭曉、均未更動、此後油洋行亞細亞與其他各大洋行及日工廠等均來扒吸、致潛勢步緊、亞細亞結進麥加利英金八辦士一二五及八辦士一〇九三七五、繼之日工廠亦購結華比美匯僅十五元八一二五、後有利又來吸進匯豐英金（四月份）穴辦士〇六二五、再結進華比美匯（四月份）十五元六八七五、近午華商投機家亦扒進外行安達及華行廣東港滙五十四元三七五、爲狀頗平、午收滙豐銀行賣價英金八辦士一二五、美匯十五元八四三七五、與晨開無異、結果較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<h3>英美金鎊　隨黃金以俱漲　美票反見軋跌</h3>
<p>昨日英純金漲半辨士、英美匯兌未動、外匯洋行結款甚殷、銀行供給未爽、雖港電時有拋塞、終以需要甚旺、勢呈軟弱、烚赤開盤即呈高漲、津帮吸收甚勁、籌碼極感缺乏、致市價劇烈上騰、又破紀錄、全日交易茶旺、勢極堅挺、外幣英美金鎊自亦不能例外、追隨金市上升、殷富搜羅不絕、頗以未能供給爲苦、美金票需要甚殷、惟供給亦旺、且有匯票牽述、故反軋跌、其他各幣、皆以滙票穏定關係、多站定未更、全日交易尙盛、公會成交絕稀、僅森泰售出英金鎊五十個、由鴻昌代殷富收進、昨日市價、英金鎊升六角、美金鎊升三角、美金票降三厘、其他各幣、俱無更動、</p>
<h3>錢業市場　恢復午市</h3>
<p>本市錢業公會市塲、原有早市午市及總會三市、自八一三戰後、市面蕭條、拆票交易大减、乃將午市及總會取銷、每日僅有早市、現公會方面以市面日興、滙劃貼現交易甚繁、乃决定恢復午市、於三月六日起實行、</p>
<h3>英印銀價近平遠長</h3>
<p>三日倫敦電、印度少數買進、同時亦有少數補空、市面平穏、收盤後、近期繼續平穏、遠期略呆、大條銀近期勿動、遠期長〇六二五、紐約銀電、美銀價依然呆定如故、又孟買銀電、印銀市况平靜、現貨未更、近遠期俱長一安那、</p>
<h3>貼現升至四十二元</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、繼續高漲、每千元上午曾升達四十二元、但至午刻稍回至四十一元半、下午突復向上、一度高達四十二元半、最後價爲四十二元、比前日續高一元半云、</p>
<h3>雜糧連市不鬆黃豆繼漲增高</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆之漲風、橫暴益甚、蓋大連市有漲無跌、人心因之激昂、投機家明抬暗扶、造成二十八年度開始以來之最新紀錄、昨各豆行情、均較上日市騰踊角外、計崇明沙黃最高價已逹八元二角五分、最低價亦須八元一角半、成交六七百包、蚌埠豆成妥二車、價爲七元七角六分、大連現豆共開四五車、價爲八元二角五分及二角六分、訂四月份交有十五車、成交價爲八元二角至八元二角半、查豆子出口、今有三百七十包運往汕頭、又一千五百九十包、運往香港、又麩皮三千五百包、亦運汕頭云、</p>
<h3>證券　公債需要愈殷　市價看漲人同此心週一恢復全天交易</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况反動漸起、元大號之現貨賣出、愈見稀少、祗賣出丁種約一二十萬元、餘均無交易、檯面需要愈殷、以前得元大之調劑、得益不少、昨因該號已束手、大戶需要、祗得暫行待機而動、環境情形好轉、愈見明朗、英國對華貸款數目、愈形擴大、交易所開市之說、市上傳說甚盛、或云在兩個月內、可以恢復營業、事實如何、尙待證賓、久靜思動之人心、乃漸見興奮、戰事前途愈見有利、可無疑問、公債看漲、已有人同此心、心同此理之現象、昨日經過、初開元大仍有賣出、多方因不知其實力、暫存觀望、同時勸工銀行及散戶稍有吃胃、市價稍疲、後以元大賣出、祗丁種十數萬、三十五號乃起搜購、爲數甚鉅、市上祇七號稍有出晚、市况因求過於供、乃復趨堅漲、收盤時天生號會出少許、同康號買進、散戶需要雖殷、惜已無貨可得、結果一致回堅、略漲一角至三角半、趨勢極爲堅穩、成交總數、約計六十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、下週一起、恢復全日交易、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股少數、價為五元二角半云、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股東本月三日（星期五）掛牌行市、滙豐銀行股自連漲兩日後、回跌一鎊及一鎊十先令、市價均爲八十七鎊、餘者無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外幣債券、本月三日（星期五）掛牌行市、平穏無變動、英倫實貨供求、亦吿兩寂</p>
<h3>糧食　麵粉期貨　成交一批　新到澳粉行市疲落</h3>
<p>昨現粉交易、仍無特殊開展、本街方面、自廠盤减低五分後、進胃尙稱活躍、而廠方除應解客帮期粉外、對於本街批購、竟乏現貨供應、故市盤反爲堅硬、至客帮期粉交易、昨有成交一批、額計五萬包、二號粉價作四元七角、三四號粉仍照原盤、又開本街新到澳洲洋粉數批、因受環境影響、價格已見疲落、如花鳥牌鐘樓牌澳粉、每包僅售四元六角六分（現鈔）、比最高價時已跌去三角光景云、</p>
<p>今日有粉一千包運往汕頭、</p>
<h3>到存兩缺麥市無形停頓</h3>
<p>昨小麥市塲、仍見寥落、市上交易，竟已無形停頓、蓋由於目下木來存到兩乏、貨方心思甚堅、惟洋粉洋麥踵接而至、環境殊爲惡劣、故買賣雙方、均鮮盡與、自晨至暮、竟無只包成交、聞送廠貨有數百包價仍相仿、正式市面、已無形停頓、且看下週初情形如何、</p>
<h3>日商採辦客秈　轉運沿海各省蕪元又漲三角</h3>
<p>客秈昨有轉口帮問津外、本街零化依然活絡、且有日商採辦轉運沿海各省、市面乃隨人心繼續上展、大市貨再漲一角半左右、高次各大角許、而蕪高秈冲埠羊尖者已開至十二元及十一元九角半、統市成交有四千餘包、蕪湖機元被河下變陰元帶好、昨叉漲三角、價至十六元半、洋米存少到絕、貨主均以奇貨可居、昨西貢一號原已開出二百餘包、泊昂三四角、價開十五元五六角、而特高陳西貢、貨主尙凝檳守扳俏云、</p>
<h3>變元漲勢轉厲</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源、河下祗到四號、車運包子三千餘包、銷塲因連朝上漲、高貨已近十四元、囤戶及本街胃口轉懈、不過售方心思尚昂、市面猶見帶秀、然其漲勢不若前市之强、厚薄粳高特貨價僅加幾分、中段貨增一角、杜洋尖埠尖無甚上落、變元則漲風仍銳、再升三角、</p>
<h3>澳麥一批昨晨抵滬</h3>
<p>英輪TreWellard號由澳洲運來洋麥七千三百五十三噸、巳於昨晨七時抵埠、該麥係達孚洋行經辦、至德輪JantzeFriTzen號亦由澳洲裝麥八千八百九十三噸、於上月十一日自澳開出、不能準期抵滬、一再延期等情、已誌前報、昨日該輪本市代理行又接該輪電吿、謂在橫濱裝就煤斤後、正擬起椗、機件忽有損壞、現正僱匠修理、約一星期可工竣、故該輪到滬又須緩至本月十五日左右</p>
<h3>紗花二十支紗嫌過賸　市盤獨跌一二元</h3>
<p>紗市顯著平靜之象、實需依然不旺、惟三二支細紗因紡織之紗錠缺乏、生產當然减少、市上存貨枯涸、且春銷時令已達、市上需耍稍起、市價則異常俏俐、十支粗紗北方天津帮納胃繼續暢健、在市搜羅不絕、售價非但不鬆、反見前進、實橡貨物一時供不應求之故也、惟二十支紗以囤戶手中旣旺、而廠方生產又增、加之近來閩南汕頭形勢叉見緊張、海南島日艦叢集、擾攘不休、人心方面、受其影響也、</p>
<p>現紗市塲情形、晨初開盤一片散淡氣象、同業相聚皆屬空談、市上之流動掮客、亦無委託、客帮均無電報來滬辦貨也、故相延至十時以外、未能做開行市、復經同業進二十支雙馬紗十五包、價爲四百元、與上日相仿、但氣勢稍疲、少頃因客銷不起、即跌一二元至三百九十八元、惟十支粗紗交易、津帮吸收繼續不懈、且市上手貨都被吸光、廠方之額開去亦不少、放人氣略昂、迨至收盤二十支雙馬紗復至三百九十九元半、午後因週六集會人頭尤稀、市態愈滯、容帮生意不旺、結果全日成交統計一千四百五十包、行情十支粗紗堅定如常、二十支雙馬紗價比上日跌一元半、天女跌一元半、特金城跌二元、三二支細紗反漲三元、廠方未有舉動、今日有棉紗一百〇五件運汕頭、三百五十件運香港、三百五十五件運廣州灣、一千三百五十五件運海防、茲將各帮口買去現紗額量錄左、</p>
<p>日紗市面與上日無大進出、實銷除天津帮外、其他區域生意仍稀、二十支水月現紗價爲三百三十五元、二十支藍鳳現貨價、爲三百二十八元半、</p>
<h3>華新紗廠遷滬改組</h3>
<p>棉紗市價、自上年突飛孟晋之後、紗廠之盈利豐厚、開歐戰以後之新紀錄、故滬埠開始新創之紗廠、猶如雨後春筍、聞青島華新紗廠、鑒於在此民族戰爭中、欲免無謂之犧牲、將紗綫拆卸裝運來滬、茲覓定廠址在莫干山路、改爲中英合辦、廠名爲信和紗廠、該廠規模宏大、設置紗綫錠有三萬錘、布機二百五十台、將後之生產數量甚旺、查其商標爲三二支·四二支松鹿·五子、二十支紗五子、十支粗紗爲九魚、布疋商標爲多寳、</p>

<h3>本棉交易　尙稱熱鬧</h3>
<p>本棉生意雖見起色、祖廠方需要仍屬平澹、惟行號方面成交較爲熱鬧、查其筆數甚煩、然包脚頗稀、至於花號方面、鑒於本棉貨物缺乏、且改變意旨、訂購印棉、交易日趨繁榮、足見本棉情形之枯涸矣、各路來源除姚花時有抵滬外、其他絕少、茲將現棉成交之額量、並市價列左、</p>
<h3>海外棉價太高　棉行竟無隻包做開</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市殊呈活躍、連漲已有多日、三月份棉價已抵八日來之新高峰、按照目前人心之傾向、棉市仍望上漲也、施密斯之棉業提案、表决日期將延至本月九日、盛傳美農民對於貸款棉之出售、一致反對、昨日紐約又漲三四磅音、孟買棉市、昨又因有經紀人一人逝世而停市、但某大洋行接得印度來電、預測白洛區爲一五四羅比半、較之前日收盤猛漲二羅比餘、埃及回跌八九磅音、昨日外匯略長、折合法幣棉價計美棉及馬西棉每担又漲二角、印棉漲四角、埃及棉回小五角餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、復形呆滯、良以海外棉價高漲之故、昨日竟無交易聞、設紐約能回小二十磅音、或印度回跌四五羅比、則各廠將又擬大量採辦矣、茲將昨日棉市、折合送廠價分列如下、糖市　去冬刁青出數銳减　僅及上年三之一</p>
<h3>糖市　去冬刁青　出數銳减　僅及上年三之一</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平穩、公會劉盤、二四粗白以及太古車白等、均呌原價、因値週六、無甚成交、國糖號貨有潮帮開出冲提青數十包、十五元七角、建帮開出雜刁洋四百包之譜、價為十六元六角、又數十包、十六元半、漳路青談價、尙未接近、無成交、查去冬出產僅及前年三分之一、統共約四萬餘担、而二十七年份總出口數爲十四餘担、溫州銷數最多云、</p>
<h3>進出口　溫州貨來滬甚多</h3>
<p>昨日進口有土紙五千八百八十件、松板二千四百四十件、生漆一百七十桶、油漆七百五十聽、烟葉五百四十四件、均由溫州來滬、至出口貨有點錫一百三十塊運往寗波、</p>

<h3>絲茶　日美絲價續小　滬絲亦告挫落　廠經已進一九〇〇元關</h3>
<p>國外絲市、日美昨一致回跌、橫濱現貨一〇二五元、較前日收盤跌二十五元、遠期九九八元、較前日晨市跌二十三元、紐約近期跌五分半、遠期跌四分、七五分·八三分日絲各跌三四分不等、上海絲跌一分、此次國外絲價之過度飛漲、乃出於投機商之手、故絲價下回、亦必與漲風相似、有出人意外變化者、本埠絲市、已深受影響、市氣更呆、咸相觀望、若干白廠經之B字、亦已進一九〇〇元關、售開一八八〇元矣、雖交易微小、但漲風已相當受挫、且如以前二日高盤一九六〇元作比較、則實際上已回下六七十元之巨、洋莊絲銷、不論英美印法、昨均無成交、意者實銷開展、須俟絲市稍復常軌、始有可能云、</p>
<h3>油餅　來源恐斷　生油猛漲一元　豆油漲無止境　豆餅再提五分</h3>
<p>生油　受人統制、劃申合成本須在四十元外、致來源必須斷絕之一日、故各帮殷搜、行情越抽越緊、結果比上日市暴漲一元八角、計膠州油先開二十三元八角、轉瞬跳出二十四元大關、至二十四元五角收盤、午後再升三角、結果二十四元八角收盤、成交七百餘件、共他繼開膠州桶油五十桶、價爲三十二元五角、及烟豪聽油二百聽、價爲三十二元、</p>
<p>豆油　全在大連集中下邁步前進、其漲風似無止境、致市塲中賣買一度曾呈混亂之狀、結果不論期現各油、一概野漲四五六角不等、計開烟岐油五百件、（行情詳市價欄、）連岐油二百大簍、一百小簍、現大連油七百桶、三月上二百桶、三月下九百餘桶、及豐年油一百桶、係亦訂三月下交貨云、</p>
<p>豆餅　仍祇有大連　之威勢、計拋開四月份交一萬五千片、價爲三元二角五分、比上日市再提五分、其他無交易、蓋因豆價橫跳、成本攸關、售價不符、故採辦者檳持、</p>
<h3>南北貨　泉泡圓　開出三千餘箱</h3>
<p>泉州大泡桂圓、前後所到之貨、共達四千餘箱、因去冬還價不合、未開、茲逢春盤、再度談價、昨始成交三千數百箱、大粒、校前升度爲一元七八角、次之數角不一、小粒因去化較呆、仍屬平常、</p>
<h3>藥材　元胡去路零星</h3>
<p>元胡約分四檔、查此間存貨、總共不過四五十件、邇來銷路以本街零拆居多、計售出修提爲五十八元、魁提五十四元、三提五十一元、四楝四十九元、較之前市、未見榮辱、</p>
<h3>海味　花色海參　西貨存底有限</h3>
<p>花色海參西洋貨、最近交易尙不寂寞、乃緣舊存有限、趨勢堅穏、售價計番烏爲一百六十七元至二百九十元、望烏一百二十八元至二百五十元、梅花參三百六十五元至四百四十元、白化二百六十五元至三百十五元、金山條一百六十五元至二百十一元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　開平煤　內盤加起四元</h3>
<p>烟煤形勢續昂、售盤多數上漲、唯一原因、厥爲外滙緊縮、成本提高所致、昨開灤公司又通吿經理行家、開平塊煤與特別屑、內盤加起四元、二號屑因到貨過剩、暫不漲價、緣是人心震盪、市態益緊、同業成交、鬧熱非凡、計開統煤每噸三十六元、篩塊三十八元、提塊四十元、總共成交六七百噸、</p>
<h3>疋頭　雨衣布缺貨　售盤因之突漲</h3>
<p>雨衣布新近到存俱缺、祇怡康·恒兀·昌記數家有執存外、共餘同業經營者甚鮮、故標準明暗均挺、非西貨日商洋行雖有定到、但爲數不多、開價突漲數角、一般字號帮暗中互有寫妥成交、蓋其躉批吸進零疋拆出、運用擒縱手段·以卜營利耳、昨英製　常灰單面開水咪、現交每碼批售八元五角、鮑別林售八元、日貨雙面紗雨布齊漲、現售二元一角、副號一元八角五、鮑別林一元九角、二號一元六角、冲麂反頭號八角半、二號七角二分五厘、</p>
<p>棉布疋頭出口、今有一百七十件運往汕頭、又二百四十件運香港、又一百八十五件運廣州灣、又五百五十件運海防、昨日祗有五百二十五件運往寗波、</p>
<h3>呢絨業寗不自為計</h3>
<p>我們眞覺得大家實在多只看到了那孤島　氣的一個表面，而忽略了其內隱的實質，正如前日木刋龍駒生先生解剖「紗花業的悲慘面」一文所說一般：「只知其一，而未知其二」—即再如咋日本刊所載「春風滿面之呢絨業」來說吧；誠然，那裏面告訴我們了許多呢絨行家的營業鼎盛的實况；但是除呢絨本業中人外，誰可曾知道隱存在這些喜色景氣之後的險惡憂患呢！</p>
<p>我們研究孤島所以會這般畸形繁榮的原因，主要的大約不外爲；（一）因戰事關係，隨着敵騎的到處，較殷實者，莫不都向孤島來避難求生；（二）因四郊交通不便，兼以特殊勢力，自外埠運銷來上海者，不易到達，致造成了這裏求過於供之勢，而物價才日益高漲：尤以被列爲舶來品之一的呢絨一項，自政府當局實施外滙統制後，因外滙小易求得，來貨旣受阻碍，而貨價才更形高漲了！</p>
<p>不過如上述貨缺價漲的情狀，是只屬於歐美等國的產物而言；其實也就因了上面的　個情狀，致造成了今日呢絨業中的這個險惡憂患，——那就是東貨的傾銷問題！</p>
<p>就日本講，他們每日幾千萬元的軍事侵略費，在國內已壓榨得無力壓榨了，因而想謀之於我們淪陷區中的中國民衆的頭上，原是個「如意算盤﹂；而在我們呢絨業中的一般唯利主義者來講：只要是「賺錢」，在他們想，是原不用分明敵我的；再在另方面講如因戰事關係，而致减弱了那些闊綽的洋裝顧主的經濟能力，多「將就」於便宜洋裝的穿着等，這幾方面的把握，才使我們明白造成了去年呢絨業的「春風滿面」者，原來却還是山於「鄰邦」的恩賜呢！</p>
<p>但當瞥着了在街頭巷尾，瑟縮着那麽多的難胞，——他們（她們）都是那砲火的恩承者，掙扎在飢餓的死亡線上；當讀着了前綫戰士的壯烈犧牲的戰訊，我是萬分　切地誠摯地希望「滿獲盈餘」「春風滿面」的呢絨業中的幸福者，快爲整個國家民族的前途打算一下，其實也就是爲自己的永久前途打算一下吧！</p>

<h3>五金　新鉛絲開出不少　白鉛絲閩浙去路亦暢</h3>
<p>新鉛絲前昨市面、異常良好、市塲開出達二三千換之多、行情略漲、如十六至二十號、每擔售二十二元五角、二十一號至二十五號、每擔開二十七元二角半、北路客商進意極濃、惟不能裝運出口、所以多在觀望、此外閩浙各帮、昨日亦有數百擔開出、</p>
<p>新鉛絲後之白鉛絲市面、亦頗俏俐、行形均好起三四角不等、如一號至六號每擔估十五元、七號至十一號、每擔售十五元七角、十二號至十三號、每擔沽十六元、十叫號起至細花色、則每擔開十七元、銷路亦以客帮爲最大、查前昨兩天、開去一千擔有餘、皆閩浙諸帮採去、本街實銷亦屬良佳、</p>

<h3>正本清源法</h3>
<p>— 力士</p>
<p>據統計：二月份本埠共發生血案十八起，死二十一人，傷十人。血案發生的地點，在公共租界者九起，在法租界者三起，在兩租界以外者六起。其構成的原因，含有政治性質者十三起，拒捕者二起，仇殺者三起。前者是誅奸的紀錄，後二者是都市罪惡的供狀</p>
<p>漢奸的被殺，是他們靦顏事仇，認賊作父的必然的結果，所以一般人對於這些血案，初不驚異，對於死者，也並不惋惜；相反的，還認爲他們罪由應得，死有餘辜；不過，那些被殺的「新貴」，頭寸有大小，罪惡有深淺，却也曾引起社會間若干不同的注意和反應。譬如說：僞「外交部長」陳籙的死，因爲他生前所作的罪孽，比較重大，一般人對之也便比較重視，而起一種反應。正爲了這個緣故，還給人家當作敲詐恫嚇的資料。</p>
<p>聽說爲了陳籙被殺而引起的不必要的交涉，關係方面，已商定妥協的原則，至於詳細的條文，本二星期內，將另有决定。這一回，是「靜默的戰爭」的勝利，還是「沉着應付」的勝利？是恫嚇者的失敗，還是妥協者的失敗？我們這時不願多加評述。但是我們認爲：要求誅奸案伴的不再發生，不是單憑妥協成立的取締條文所能奏效的。要明白，誅奸行動是抗戰中的中國國民的自發的愛國行爲，如果一般「新貴」，今後不再匿居在租界內作非法活動，那麼此類行勁自然會休止的。所以要確保租界的安寗，該先加緊防止「新貴」們在界內的活動，這纔是正本淸源的辦法。</p>
<p>我們同情租界當局的困難，同時對於租界當局過去維護租界治安，已盡至善至大的努力，表示至高的崇敬。如果租界當局認爲近來血案頻起，困難叢生，那麼便該採取「正本淸源」的辦法，來應付目下的情勢</p>
<h3>騙取文稿的黑幕</h3>
<p>— 公懷</p>
<p>文人的貧窮，眞是普遍的現象，上海雖是全國文化的中心，但文人，貧窮程度，却並不亞於內地。於是，不得不靠着一枝禿筆，嘔心絞腦，加緊筆耕的工作，企圖用一張張密密寫着字的稿紙，去換取一塊塊的麵包，來維持生活，就是把外來的一切加諸文人身上的壓力都撇開說，文人的物質環境，也是够凄凉的。而竟有許多不怕血腥的人，扼住了文人貧窮的弱點，用種種欺詐的手段，來騙取文人用腦汁壓榨出來的文稿，以達到他牟利的目的。上海，是一個「人吃人」的社會，由此益信。</p>
<p>有一次，在報上的分類廣吿中，找到一段「徵求文稿」的啟事：言明每千字致酬二元至五元，不用亦負責退還。當時，我就寄了一篇稿子去，並於稿末聲明，如决定不用，須照址把稿件退還；但一寄之後，即如石沉大海，音訊杳然。後來，偶然在報攤上看到一本雜誌，中有一篇文章，却和我寄出的文章大同小異，不過換了個題目，下面的署名，自然也不是原來的了。我因氣不過那個欺騙者的卑劣手段，就寫了封信給那雜誌社的編輯，但也沒有獲得解釋和答覆。諒來和我同樣受騙的人，一定不少的吧？</p>
<p>還有一次，是我的朋友，去應「翻譯員」試騐，因錄取後有八十元一月的待遇，如程度優異或辦事認眞，還可有升級，加薪的希望。於是，正被失業的苦痛襲擊着的我的友人，就毅然的去了。考試的手續，非常簡單，祇把某書的一節，譯成中文，再口試一番就好了。我的朋友，和其他應試的人，自然都很賣力的埋頭譯作，口試的那位先生，還像煞有介事的對每個應試者說：待審核後，錄取的再來通知罷·那知約定十天揭曉，到二十天還毫無動靜。當時，大家以爲自己的程度較差，只得自怨自艾，失去這樣一個絕好的機會·但黑幕總於被發覺了，因有幾個英語程度很好的朋友，同時去應試，大家在揭曉期內，延頸以盼佳音之來，而結果，都失望了。不多幾日坊間就有某書的中譯本出售，原來他們那天去做了幾小時的義務翻譯，各人所譯的，是不同的各節，彙集起來，略加竄改，就成一本譯著了。其用心之巧，眞是令人嘆服。</p>
<p>還有許多新出的報章雜誌，都在刊物上大刊「徵稿條例」，定的稿酬標準，當然是很高的，而去投稿的人，多數是白費了心血，一無所獲。筆者前後碰到道樣的事實，已好幾回</p>
<p>最近，聽說某方主辦的××月刊，也在採用這種手段徵稿的啟事，希望同文不要被其朦混，因爲這不是單純的稿費問題，而是將使我們蒙受終身洗不淸的惡名，同時在客觀效果上，又予敵人以什麼「文化合作一的便利。</p>
<p>在上海，眞是個詐術流行的都市，連文人們也難逃詐術的欺騙。是篇之作，也算是揭發一些黑幕。</p>
<h3>舞女自殺案</h3>
<p>— 費人</p>
<p>在上海，有何止千萬的可憐底女性，在過着黑暗的，地獄似的生活。舞女也是其中之一。表面上，做舞女果然也是自由的婦女職業，但在這稱爲罪惡的淵藪的大都市中，她們的背後正緊緊地跟隨着惡魔的影子。除了極少數，爲了家境淸貧，自願投到這燈紅酒綠的懷抱之中；其他，據我們知道的，有的是從內地拐騙來的，有的如工廠中的「包身工」一樣，以極低廉的代價收押人家的女兒來做他們的搖錢樹，所謂「×家班×姊妹」的就是。或許還有更陰險刻毒的黑幕，那是非局外人所可以知道的了</p>
<p>第一種不談。後面兩種身體旣失了自由，那些鴇母似的「姆媽」自然一步也不肯放鬆，不顧人家的死活，儘量在她們身上榨錢，最近的報上，就發現了好幾起舞女自殺的新聞。</p>
<p>把她們自殺的原因歸納起來，不外是婚姻不遂，如轟傳一時的賀蝶自殺案；不堪虐待等。這些可憐的寃魂，自然又是屬於後面兩種的。以一個弱女子，又沒有其他的謀生技能，她們在逃不出惡魔的手掌的時侯，祇有出此下策，其智雖愚，其情確也可憫的。</p>
<p>記得卡爾登公演「花濺淚」時，有許多觀衆，在塲中泣不成聲，據說她們都是舞女。那末，她們當然從米米，顧小妹的身上，看到了自己的影子，而滴下同情之淚了。但是「花濺淚」的劇旨並不是在賺取舞女的熱淚，那個覺醒的丁香，才是每個舞女的好榜樣。</p>
<p>這不是劇作者的幻想，在千萬的舞女羣中，正有着這般可愛的姑娘，八一三神聖抗戰的砲聲一響，有許多舞女洗却鉛粉，穿上白制服，到傷兵醫院去服務，現在更有許多舞女，在日中偷得一點時問，到補習學校去讀書。「認淸自己的身份，負起自己的責任！」希望每個人能接受「花濺淚」所給予的敎訓！</p>
<p>讀我再抄一句丁香的話，「不應該死的時候，不要自暴自棄的自殺，應該死的時候，也不要偷生怕死的逃避」！</p>
<h3>吃金飯碗的人　銀行職員的生活</h3>
<p>— 銀行員</p>
<p>（一）金飯碗不再是　吃銀行飯的形容詞</p>
<p>這是一個令人艷羨的名稱—銀行飯是金飯碗。可是現在的情勢是怎樣呢？銀行飯仍舊是金飯碗嗎？確是需要有一個爽捷的回答。但是這在表面上是看不出的：銀行高而大的建築物，堂而皇之設備，還一樣地矗立着，陳列着，也許比以前來得更「高」「大」「精」「美」，雖然它的業務已受着社會經濟不景氣的影響，對外放款抱定了保守政策。</p>
<p>在以前：每一家銀行每年都可以賺上幾寓，幾十萬，或是幾百寓的；原都是由經營公債和地產而來。近幾年來，環境不同了，對於這兩者的經營受到各方面的限制；一方面對於有利於「國計民生」的「農村放款」，却叉踟躕不前—固然，農村放款的資金在週轉上是比較呆遲得多。每年盈餘在這樣的條件限制下，自然逐年减少。行員們的「年終獎金」各人本來都拿三個月薪金爲標準；此外看每年的盈餘狀况再有「特別獎金」的分派，少則一個月，多則有超過「普通獎金」的。這樣，一位每月三四十元的行員，一到年終，也就有一百到二百的收入—雖然比不上一二十年前的「分紅」是根據每年的盈餘爲標準的普通辦事人員也就可以有幾百或幾千分得的</p>
<p>但是，自從前年戰事發生後，「年終獎金」有幾家是仍以三個月照發，有幾家一個月，然而「不名一文」的也竟不止一家，甚至有藉着「業務淸閒」「節省開支」等等名目而裁汰了不少的行員，名義上或則是各有不同：有「疏散」的，有「遣散」的，有「停薪留資」的。本來所謂金飯碗的銀行，行員們沒有重大過處是决不會停職的—內外的情勢旣然如此；「金飯碗」這形容銀行的形容詞是不再確當的了，現在，我們只能稱它是「已有裂紋的」飯碗，祇多也不過是「鍍金的」罷了</p>
<p>（二）等級升級和薪金</p>
<p>銀行職員如果拿等級來分，大致可分成四級：經理副理襄理這一單主管人員是一級，主任科長領股領組等各部分負責人是一級，辦事員助理員是一級，練習生事務生或呌做伺應生的叉是一級。在以前—各行的練習生都是擔任傳遞工作的，跟舊式商店的學徒差不多，近幾年來，有幾家銀行在節省開支之原則下，添設了許多事務生，薪金較練習生爲少，地位也在練習生之下，所做的工作就是以前練習生所做；這一來，練習生的地位是增高而增高了，擔任的工作也和助理員辦事員差不多，練習生大約在三年後就可以升爲助理員，不過也不是一定的。助理員升爲辦事員比較的容易；若再上去，希望升爲主任科長或是副理襄理，如果你跟「當局」沒有一點關係的話，那麽簡直可以說是「夢想」，只要看今日幾家銀行的副理襄理或是主任科長，那位不是經理們的「至親好友」，或是他們所介紹的可以瞭然了。</p>
<p>說到薪金，在外界不知道內部的人，以爲普通一個行員即可以有一二百至少也有六七十元一月，然而他們的理想是理想，事實是事實，理想往往和事實相反；銀行正如其他公司行號一樣，也有大小之分，幾家大的銀行，不供膳宿的一位練習生，每月就可以有三五十元，助理員可以八九十元，辦事員以上自然更大了。可是幾家小銀行呢？供給膳宿的一位練習生，祇多是十幾元，六七元一月的也有，助理員二十幾元，辦事員也僅有三五十元；試想當一位助理員辦事員的，他們在銀行裏祇少也都有上三四年的歷史，多則七八年，年齡總在二三十至三四十間，對於家庭總也有相當的負擔，然而每月的所得僅僅像上面所說的這樣，拿金飯碗目銀行的，對於這一點將不知作何感想呢？（未完）</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第五回　春到碧蘿香浮雪海　花飛虎阜月滿蠡湖</p>
<p>因爲朱愛人不喜歡到石湖書院去。因此她們說：先到那裏坐一坐，我們便去吃飯。何家兩位小姐，她們是不曾來過，也不曉得到那裹去好。朱愛人也不大能出游，今天眞是忙裏偷閒，全仗吳君素嚮導。但是吳君素不是一位善於嚮導的人，究竟她也是難得出來游玩的，不十分熟悉。吳君素便說：『那邊有座治平寺，進去隨喜一下好嗎？』朱愛人也搖搖頭，這時汽車緩緩沿湖濱而行，到了一個水閣子面前，那是一家花樓，寫着『閑雲』兩字。那地方倒也精雅乾凈，朱愛人便說：『我有好幾年不會上茶館喝茶了，我們到裏面喝杯茶，兩位姊姊以爲如何？』何家兩位小姐原無可無不可的。朱愛人見了這閑雲兩字，便心有所動，因想每日忙得要命的，今天不妨閑它一閑。誰知這個水閣子，所處的地位非常之好，在那裹可以全湖在望。她們坐下了，茶博士便來招呼，送上了四杯茶。但見滿湖的游艇很多，可是遠遠地不時見有小汽船飛駛而過。吳君素道：『有人說：蘇州的石湖，可與杭州的西湖，相提並論，實在是大大的不同。兩位姊姊，到杭州西湖去過嗎？』何儷玉道：『我們都沒有去過。』吳君素道：『兩位姊姊旣到這裹來，杭州的西湖，不能不去一次。這是我們中國一個天然的大公園。我們中國山川靈秀，文化綿延，雖然在國內到處有那種自然的公園，但杭州西湖那個大公園，是世界聞名的，不可不往一游。這個石湖，近年來雖然在周圍也造了許多山莊別墅，然而要及杭州西湖，那眞似小巫之見大巫了。而最大的不同之處，就是西湖那個地方，自成一個天地，與外河不通。凡是西湖裹的船，不能到外面去，外面的船，也不能到西湖裹來。倒是這樣隔絕的好，船隻不能混雜，否則西湖也不能如此淸凈。還有浙江因爲近海，錢塘江日日潮來，要是西湖和外面通了，潮水侵入西湖上便要發生問題。記得從前有位某君，不曾到過西湖，僅憑理想，描寫湖中夜潮發生‘却不知道西湖自古不通潮呢。至於石湖，那就不能與外界隔絕，如西湖一般呀！』（五二）</p>

<p>又如伐子都一劇，按劇情說，公孫子都嫉才貪功，暗算頴考叔，理應受人唾駡，使觀衆發生厭惡之感；可是有時殊不盡然，假如扮演子都的是一個成了名的靠把武生的話，這出塲一亮相，就會傳個滿堂彩，以後許多火爆的開打，繁重的身段，彩聲正多着呢。反顧那位穎考叔，因爲屈居配角，白死一塲，反不使人注意。又如看逍遙津，如飾曹操者是一名凈，當他帶劍入宮，威脅天子，奸相畢露，觀衆定會報以彩聲，贊許他的演技；反之，若是那個扮王子的生角，走錯台步，或是忘了劇詞，觀衆也不會因同情他是個末路帝王而不給一個倒好。這也是舊劇情隨着演技而轉變的一個實例。</p>
<p>這種畸形發展的結果，使舊劇的盛衰，緊隨着伶人的優劣爲轉移。觀衆欣賞的對象，都集中在伶人的演技，反把全劇的意識，輕輕忽略了。一面又因成名的伶人，雄據大戲院，賣大價錢，大衆對他的演技，沒有欣賞的機會。如梅蘭芳程艷秋單上演時，票價動輒三四元，即使劇情如何前進，演技如何高超，也僅足供達官巨富的欣賞，小市民是無緣問津，他們祗好擁到不健全的平民劇院中去欣賞那種低級趣味的胡鬧戲劇。於是舊劇的地位愈趨愈下，觀衆的程度也被拉着同流合汚。</p>
<p>另外，那些極少數的矢忠於舊劇的研究家，他們慨嘆舊劇的日就衰落，誠恐先輩典型，行將湮沒失傳，便從事研究致據蒐集保存一切舊劇所有的精華。他們大都以業餘資格，費過二三十年以上的光陰，用欣賞純文藝的態度，來欣賞舊劇。他們過去有着良好的機會，親見過第一流先進伶人的演技，而且和他們切磋過。他們熟悉一切舊劇的技巧，他們愛好舊劇，和玩書畫玩骨董一般無二，他們祇知道應該珍視保存，這一派人，在北方以齊如山爲代表，南方以蘇少卿徐慕雲爲代表。自然他們那種頑固守舊的態度，要被自命爲前進者斥爲昏庸老朽；但是在今日舊劇的新的地位上看來，我以爲他們的態度是準確的，他們的努力是最有效果的，他們以前對於舊劇雖沒有什麽建樹，可是因了他們的態度忠實，已做了舊劇在行將覆亡之際的保駕功臣。（明日續完）</p>
<h3>新春聽楊寶森捉放曹</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>廢歷正月初六日，友人約聽黃金楊寳森演捉放曹，余到時纔八八點一刻，台上捉放曹已唱殺家，李克昌扮曹操，唱白皆有規矩，惜嗓音欠洪亮，身材欠高大，然在現在大面中，已不可多得。楊寳森嗓音，已較去年又有進步，殺家時緊張情形，做得不足，論其唱工，「他一家大小遭禍殃，」「唬得我三魂七魄忙，」二句，均未得法；至「陳宮心中似刀札」一段搖板，時下久享大名之角，對此段多唱不好，寳森比較尙可；「多蒙老丈」之丈字，寳森加虛昔　字，不如本音好，改之爲是。惡字是鼻音，實森此字錯，見老丈被殺，唱「陳宮啊」自以嘎調爲妙，今寳森唱平調，想因高音不起之故，若唱平調，不如將「陳宮一見，咽喉啞」一句連唱，不必切住也。至「聽他言」大段西皮慢板，頗見精彩，惟完全學小余，吾不謂然。以小余唱片爲證，「自己做差」前加墊字我字，與我難以回馬」之我字墊字犯重複之病，小余不自知，學者盲從，豈不可笑；况此段我字甚多，故譚鑫培唱法「自己做差」前不用墊字，曲律不得多用墊字，多用墊字，俗名曰貧，望凡學小余此段者，注意改之。（「暫且」二字亦犯貧病，可刪，）又唱末句「勸解於他」他字下用虛音呀字，此亦學小余唱片，不知小余此字最不合字法，凡家麻韻，（即「花發轍」）之字，不許變虛音，蓋此韻係兩合音，韻母是啊音，一變音即成呀字或喲字成爲飄音。小余號爲宗譚，盛名煊赫，又有人稱其懂字音，竟於他字下　呀字，大犯曲律，而學之者不知選擇，並學其病，故特爲指出之，「一輪明月」二簧數段唱得不差，「疑心忒大」忒字唸太字，而又走中眼，亦大背唱法，叉有倒字數個，今不詳說，寳森頗有厚望，故爲求全責備如此。</p>
<h3>溜冰術（十一）</h3>
<p>— 蓮君琦珍合編</p>
<p>初學入門（續前）</p>
<p>（九）若雙足全用鞋之外邊行動，則在換足以前。主足行動將終止之時，須暫將重心移至裏鞋邊，俾推進時得以益臻順利，但交脚行動則無此舉，因須用外鞋邊推動也。又如用裏鞋邊行動，亦無此舉</p>
<p>（十）學習循序而進，無有不成功者，所謂次序，即：</p>
<p>一、先學進前退後停止及轉灣各法，二、學身之運用法及基本四邊，（八勢）三、學換邊八字行及三字轉，四、學其餘各種轉身如正反搖轉及反三字轉等。五、學專家所做之花式及自由變化。</p>
<p>學全第三步，方有考取初級希望，（見考試與比賽）</p>
<p>身之運用法</p>
<p>（甲）身之姿勢人身重心之位置，手臂腿臀之動作，腰膝之剛柔，以至身體各部之一舉一動，均有雅俗之分，雅則姿勢優美。若以溜冰而論，姿態尤關緊急，無論比賽或考試，或自由溜冰，第一須能做各式花樣，第二即須注意於姿勢之雅觀，姿勢雅觀，動作自然，步法正確，花樣翻新，則溜冰得其道矣。溜冰者應注意於全身，而不可僅留意於冰鞋，蓋全身較足部爲重爲先，而足則僅係身之一部耳。</p>
<p>身　身宜直而不僵，並宜穩定，而有把持，庶幾叫肢平勻，運用自如，身宜輕，輕則去若驚鴻，來如遊龍。</p>
<p>首　頭官舉，目不宜時時下視</p>
<p>手　兩手忌緊握，並不宜於攤掌。</p>
<p>臂　雙臂須自然下垂，不宜用力。</p>
<p>腰　腰不宜折，即腰部不宜前折或傍折。</p>
<p>膝　膝宜有彈性而略灣，且能</p>
<p>大屈，全身之升降宜用屈膝法。</p>
<p>腿　客動時，須在臀部，而不在膝部，大腿不宜夾緊。</p>
<p>趾　舉足時、趾向下，足趾離地時，宜如賽跑狀，直而向外。</p>
<p>全身須留意搖盪，各部動作宜態度從容，身與四肢須與進行方向平行，轉動時宜用臀轉，最易犯之通病是身曲腰折，用鞋之外邊行動時，最易見之。</p>
<h3>北平李麗又告失踪</h3>
<p>— （聶格自港寄）</p>
<p>北平李麗來港之後，即應聯藝公司之聘，主演「一代尤物一，該片攝製大半時，發生週折，停工若干時，直至廢曆歲尾，始吿完竣；李以合作人員對其均表好感，為聯絡情誼起見，特在除夕夜以請吃年夜飯爲名，大宴一代尤物一中工作人員，狂歡暢飲，逸趣風生，李以飲酒過多，醉後失態，於是縱聲高歌，語無倫次，四周鄰居，咸驚來探視，詛知越日李忽吿失踪，蓋已秘密離港他往，於是謠言紛紜，有謂係去河內，有謂去舊金山參加金門博覽會，有謂去渝，更有謂係來滬上，蓋滬上某大公司曾請其至滬演片，撲朔迷離，令人難測，若李麗者，確爲神秘女郎矣。</p>
<p>又據靈通方面洩漏之消息，李確係乘機去重慶，二十日後仍返港，並謂李去時御棕色西式裝束，戴咖啡色闊邊呢帽，隨帶皮箱數隻以去。</p>

<h3>美總統的公子　近亦從事影業</h3>
<p>— 淡雲</p>
<p>美國總統羅斯福的長公子傑姆士辦斯福，向來跟他的父親辦事，在白宮裏充常書記官，最近放棄政治生涯，而加入了美國桑繆爾高爾溫影片公司，職位是副總裁，那公司便是美國電影業巨頭桑繆爾高爾溫所創設的。事情好像有些使人怪異，羅總統的長公子是個影迷嗎？且看他自已怎麽說罷，他說：『我能和高爾溫先生合作，眞是非常歡忭，我想從事一種實業，它的特點必須是爲公衆服務的，我有這種思想已經好久了，現在我有機會加入電影事業，而和高爾溫君一起工作，來繼續這種服務公衆的實業，而保持恒久的記錄。』</p>
<p>那末，傑姆士羅斯福的加入影業，他的目的也可山此窺見一斑了。不過高爾溫公司方面還沒有發表他日後的職位是那一種性質，一般關心的人都以爲他大致將在營業方面努力的。</p>
<p>據熟悉好萊塢歷來事件的人追想起羅總統家庭和影業的關係來，都記得前年七月裏，高爾溫曾請羅總統夫人做一篇文字，它是評論高爾溫所監製的一張影片，名呌「StellaDallas一，而帶有爲這張影片做宣傳的色彩的，這篇文字在美國主耍雜誌裹差不多都登載過。</p>
<p>幾個月之前，羅總統向國會聯席會議演說，高爾溫公司曾把它攝成有聲新聞片，依照高爾溫的意思，最近攝製的「牛郎織女」，想把這一段新聞片揷在裏面，但終於不能照他的意見辦理，因爲羅總統的秘書吿訴高爾溫說，拍攝羅總統的新聞片，是不准許揷入賣錢的影片裏的。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一二〇）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>不拜師不能吃戲飯</p>
<p>馬連良的琴師楊寳忠，誰都知道他是伶界世家，唱鬚生時並且拜過叔岩，但是他一要改入塲面這行，也得先拜到塲面前輩耿五的門下，然後才許他正式吃這行飯。不論在那個園子遇到文武塲上的打鼓老等，都得關照他一二，他拜耿五之先，並沒徵得叔岩同意，及至余三知道，還駡他欺師滅祖，氣得不亦樂乎。</p>
<p>新近北平出了一位好鼓手，名呌白登雲，人家都喚他白登，這人年紀四十多歲，平素專學喬三（名玉泉，連良鼓手。）一派，穩而且準，輕易不大脫板。他因很崇拜喬三，又有許多朋友勸他下海，他遂轉託很多有面子的人向喬三請求，要拜他爲師。誰知喬三恐怕搶了他的飯，（北平一切鼓手，要以喬三價碼最昂，但是因他能耐高，唱角總覺用他保險，所以新出來的角色，在初次登臺露演的當兒，都把他請來，可是一齣戲打下來，至少就得三十元。）不能任意高抬身價啦，所以他咬定牙不願意收他。有些人看着不憤，就把老前輩鮑桂山（常隨小樓）搬出來啦，這般人情願拿出錢大請其客，爭爭這口氣。當時帖子撒出去，喬三一瞧是他師傳出名，當然不敢不到，及至到了宴所，方才知道是收白登雲的喜筵，他放着師父不願做，反倒當了人家的大師兄，道也是他意想不到的。</p>
<p>上面略舉幾個例，足見吃梨園這行飯，確甚艱難，尤其內行排擠外行，更是故都特有的怪現象。</p>

<h3>讀書與學業</h3>
<p>— 大孩子</p>
<p>—檢點過去努力將來</p>
<p>光陰過去得眞快，匆匆，一個悠長的學期早又開始了；自然，有的因為上學期考試不及格而留了級，或為完全不及格而不能入學，有的固然是名列前茅，可是勉强及格的，我想一定也不在少數。</p>
<p>大家一樣地出了學費讀書，一樣地受先生的敎導，爲什麼有的會及格，有的不及格，更有的能够名列前茅呢？親愛的小朋友們，你們倒想想看，究竟爲了什麼原因？</p>
<p>小朋友們，我吿訴你們吧，那完全是爲了你們平常時候不用功的緣故，因爲你們在日常不把功課努力，只想贪玩，懶惰，於是等到一學期的結束便分出了好壞，如果你們在平時用功的話，那也用不着到了臨考試的時候再急來抱佛脚了。</p>
<p>自己的學業比別人差，已經够使人慚愧；何况還要不及格呢，那眞是多麽可恥的一回事啊！這如何對得住父母給你求學的熱誠，如何對得住先生敎導你的苦心，同時，在同學之間也未免說不過去。不過，「已往不可追，來者猶可爲。」親愛的小朋友們，過去的總究是過去了，如今我們就是對它追悔也已沒用，我們現在旣明白了從前的錯誤，祗有設法去怎樣努力我們的將來，在本學期裏，加倍用功，以補前缺，這還未始不能使自己成爲一個好孩子。</p>
<p>然而最要緊的是，我希望每一個小朋友，不管上次的考試及格與否，都能够把過去一個學期中的一切檢點一下，不論功課方面，或行爲習慣方面，自己究竟可曾有過付麼不合的地方；有則改之，無則加勉，在本學期中，我們需耍將道不合的地方或缺點，加以革除，努力於學業。「知過必改，得能莫忘，」這乃是古時聖賢所說的話，我們不妨借來作爲鼓勵自已的座右銘。况且，古今人儘多着窮苦好學的孩子，後來都成了有偉大人格的聖賢，像鑿壁偷光，雪夜苦讀的那些故事，我想你們也許在敎科書上讀過的吧，這正好給我們做個榜樣，何况，我們都是有着這麽好的環境，比起他們來眞是天之驕子了，現在再不用功讀書，不但白白辜負了寳貴的光陰，而且也有點慙愧！</p>
<p>「少小不努力，老大徒傷悲」！親愛的小朋友們，努力吧，我們不要再把本學期的時光浪費了，儘讓別的同學名列前茅呀！</p>
<h3>籌募難民生產敎育經費的響應</h3>
<p>— 王陵</p>
<p>這偉大的運動，已於三月一日開始實行了，小朋友們年紀雖小，見識較狹，可是你們也是國民的一份子，當然也要負起十萬元以上經費的責任，如齊心合力的響應起來，這運動不難迅速實現，而使難民們早日得到寳貴的生存的技能。</p>
<p>小朋友，你們雖經過一度變動後，乃很幸運的繼績求學，更有優美的家庭環境。但是在我們周圍，有不少的難民，過着猪狗不如的生活，他們爲什麽受到這許多痛苦呢？無非家被破毀了，事業失掉了，顚沛流離的到了上海，舉目無親，經濟斷絕，吃的穿的都沒有，一年餘以來，雖然有熱心人士極力接濟，使他們有衣服蔽寒，有食物充飢，有遮雨避風的居所住。可是如一日缺少了救濟，難民們只好痛苦的挨餓，瘦骨如柴的難童們，哀號的向可憐的父母取食，爲了接濟辦法不是妥當的。於是在環境需要下，急切的推行了。「籌募難民生產敎育經費的運動」。使難民們得到生活的至寳，使難童不致荒廢了寳貴的光陰和學業。至於籌募經費方面，希望小朋友注意二點；</p>
<p>一，只怕不實行不怕金錢少——小朋友們如果有了一分或一角錢，不要想這一些錢有什麼用處呢，你們如果每天有五分的點心錢或糖果錢，不是很快的二十天就能積成一元了嗎？這一元錢可供難童一學期的學費，能使難民學到一種技能，一元錢的價値是多麽偉大呢，每個小朋友個個能把一分五分或一角的錢省下來，不久後我相信在上海的十萬難民，都能受到吃不完用不盡的畢生技能。</p>
<p>二，只怕不盡責，不怕募不到——有的小朋友或想，向人募錢，是很羞恥的事，有的在事前有所顧慮，如果捐不到碰到一鼻子灰，不是很難堪的麽？倘有了這種思想你們才永不會捐到錢，因沒有責任心的緣故。假使一個熱心募捐的小朋友，决不會遇到困難的，他們反而被你們愛國愛羣的行動感觸，毫不吝惜的拿出來了。有的人恐怕還在慚愧自己沒有你們小孩子這樣的熱心呢。所以你們的籌募，對於社會是負了責任，對於自己，是受了獎譽，不是一舉兩得嗎？</p>
<p>讓我們從今天起努力的進行吧！</p>
<h3>摜砲</h3>
<p>— 吳鼎康</p>
<p>小朋友，摜砲這個名字，大約聽見過的，它的種類很多，有大的有小的，裏面都裝有火藥，只要向地上一摜，就會發出很響的聲音。摜砲的價格很便宜，只須一二分錢就可以買幾個。摜砲在新年間最流行，也爲小朋友唯一的娛樂物。除此之外，還有許多和摜砲一類的東西，像九龍取水，萬花筒等，都是用火藥做的，晚上燃放，非常好看。</p>
<p>有一天，看見一羣小孩，他們分了二隊，每隊有十多個人，各人的手裏都拿了大的小的摜砲，互相射擊，一時劈劈拍拍的聲音大作，好像發生了衝突，起了戰爭。他們越戰越激烈，摜砲犧牲了好幾百個，火藥味隨時可聞，他們還不肯休，繼續的作戰，好像他們是生死存亡的决戰。不料樂極生悲發生了一件不幸的事；有一個小孩拿了一個小的摜砲，向另一個孩子射去，恰巧射在那孩子的眼中，而且小的摜砲是爆炸的，接着那孩子的眼中流出鮮紅的血，他就携了眼大哭起來，羣孩見闖了禍，就四散奔逃。各位小朋友，你們靜了心想一想看，他們犧牲了幾百個摜砲，也就是犧牲了許多金錢，所得到的是什麽？他們的結果是什麽？</p>
<p>各位小朋友，摜砲雖然是唯一的娛樂物，但在不小心的時候，也會闖禍的，而且摜砲是二種消耗品，在每個年頭，不知耍犧牲多少金錢，而得到的是害。假使有這許多買摜砲的錢去捐給難民，到好得多呢，所以我希望各位小朋友，絕對的禁玩摜砲，因爲它是只有害處而沒有益處的。</p>

<h3>做一個小無綫電家（四）</h3>
<p>— 奚人</p>
<p>三，天綫和地綫</p>
<p>王民認識了很多的另件以後，心裏自然是非常快活，就拖了他堂哥的手，一面晚，「哥哥，我們到花園裏去玩玩吧」，他的堂哥說，「好的」，兩人就一同出去。</p>
<p>跑到花園裹，三民突然看見了一樣東西，但他不知道這東西呌什麽和有什麽用處這一個問題存在他的腦子中已很久了，今天可巧有他的堂哥在此，他就問他的堂哥說，「哥寄，你看那家開頂上張着的一根綫做什麽用的？咦，那邊也有，這邊也有，喔，很多很多」。</p>
<p>他的堂哥抬起頭看一看王民指着的東西，就笑着說，「這是無綫電的門戶」。</p>
<p>「什麽？是無綫電的門戶？那麽爲何要裝在屋頂上」？王民弄得不懂起來。</p>
<p>他的堂哥知道他是纏錯了，替他解釋說，「你不要弄錯，這不是眞的房子上的門口的門戶，這是譬喻，因爲無綫電的聲音都是從天綫上傳進來的，正好像房子的門口裏可以走進人來一樣，所以我就說天綫是無錢電的門戶，現在你可懂了嗎」？</p>
<p>「哦，原來是這樣的」。王民點了點頭說，「那麼爲什麼有的用一根綫，有的用二根綫，有的甚至於用三根四根綫的；我還看見在四馬路中西大藥房的屋頂上張了許許多多的綫，每一根綫上還縛着一個個黑的東西，這父是什麼東西呢」？</p>
<p>王民的堂哥望着王民說，「是的，天綫也有許多式樣，有一根綫的，有兩根綫的，也有三根四根綫併在一起的，其實用處都是一樣的，只是式子不同罷了。至於你在中西大藥房屋頂上看見的，名字也呌做天錢，不過這種天綫是播音台上用的，普通的收音機用的天綫用不着這樣考究」。</p>
<p>「綫上的一粒粒黑東西是行麽呢」？王民追問了一一句。</p>
<p>「你知道那一粒粒黑東西是用什麼原料做成的」？他的堂哥反問王民。</p>
<p>是不是鐵做的丁王民回答。</p>
<p>「不是鐵，是玻璃或者瓷器做成的。因爲前面說過，無綫電的音波都是從天綫上傳進來的，但是音波最容易傳去，所以大綫部份一定要和其他的東西隔絕，那個黑色的東西就是這樣用的，它能够使天綫和其他的東西聯起來，但是天錢上的音波不會傳到其他的東西上去。因爲它有隔絕的効用，所以普通都呌他做「絕緣子」。</p>
<p>「哦，原來天錢上也有這樣多的花頭，以前我總以爲天綫是沒有道理的，只要用一根綫張張就是」。</p>
<h3>上舟</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>—明兒避難記之十四—</p>
<p>當明兒父親和張，李兩先生回到那過塘行中時，有一個身材魁梧而面龐黝黑的人路進來。</p>
<p>「你們不是要呌艙嗎？」他問着李先生。「是的，你可有船嗎？」李先生立即很快的回答着。「有是有一艘，不過已有人定去了。但是那客人要等二三天後動身。可是道裏的風聲很緊，所以我想還是早些離開這裏爲妙，若是你們要的活，倒可以讓給你們的。「那麽到屯溪，連酒錢在內，要多少錢呢？」「飯菜不在內，最使宜的，二百塊錢。」「胡說，胡說，你不要當我們是陌生客人。我在一年中上下要好幾次，在平時不過八十塊錢。」「先生，這幾大的船錢，是性命換來的，萬一飛機丟下了炸彈，不是玩的。」「好，廢話不要多講，爽爽氣氣，一百塊錢，你去不去？」那船夫一聽到這話，當然是不答應的，便笑了一笑的去了。</p>
<p>明兒的父親和張先生一聽到了有船，心中倒是一喜。</p>
<p>那過塘行的經理走過來，和李先生說：「這幾天，船少而呌船的人多，如果局勢仍是一天緊一天，我們也想回家鄉去。你們再加一些，呌他退讓一些便好了。而這船我可以担保你們趁很穏妥的。」於是李先生和明兒父親張先生二人商量了一番，將船價再加了一些，後來那船夫也來了，兩方又再加上和退讓才成功了。那李先生嫌船價是貴了一些，可是張先生是很性急，他决定今晚一定要離開這裏，船價貴一些倒不在乎；明兒父親也以爲這樣，因此李先生不得不答應下來。那時他們的行李。也由小船駁來了。於是搬上行李，又忙了好一會兒。</p>
<p>那船夫氣喘喘的走進來說；「大船已駛近了，你們去看一看。」於是明兒隨着他父親向江邊走去。</p>
<p>那天晚上，一彎牙月，幾粒閃爍的星，點綴在天空。他們走過了高低不平的石路，漸漸地踏着軟軟的沙　，那時潮水已退了。明兒看見沙灘的遠處靠着一艘大船。一條狹長的跳板擱在兩端它差不多有幾十步長。明兒帶着很驚恐的語調，說道：「這狹狹的板怎麽走呢？萬一失足，跌下水去，怎麽辦？﹂他便小心翼翼的跟着父親走上了，眼見那板下的水，一蕩一蕩的好似歡迎他下去，他極力的放大了膽，走了過去，倒也不覺得甚麽。不過他的心還有些跳蕩。</p>
<p>那船是很大的，裏面收拾得還算淸潔，船的兩旁有四個床舖，他們1時只看了一看，便匆匆的回到了過塘行。</p>
<p>那時明兒的弟妹們都躺在櫈上睡了，母親也有些倦意，伊看見他們走進來，便問道：「我們今晚要上船麽？現在已十二時多了。」「要的，讓行李先裝上了船。」父親答着。他一面呌明兒出去點明行李的件數，於是明兒拿了電筒跑出去。「喂，小弟弟，你不可以把電筒向天空照，不然，要被捉去的。」那行裏的人叮囑他，他才知道了，因爲當飛機來的時候，那些漢奸放着信號，作爲投彈的目標，要是把電筒向天空照射，便有漢奸的嫌疑了</p>
<p>經過了一陣搬行李的忙，他們才扶老携幼的上船了。這樣狹長的跳板，那些膽小的小孩子和老太太，怎樣走呢？明兒先預備了一根繩子，呌他們膽小的拉着他的繩，脚橫着一步步慢慢地走上了。那時明兒母親抱着一個睡着的弟弟，手中牽着小妹妹，並且伊又是膽小的於是明兒在前拉着，覺得他母親的手在發冷。他父親在後推着，好容易的走上了船。母親的心中遂忐忑的跳着。伊更說道：「這種的驚嚇，出生出世還是第一遭。」後來他們一夥兒都上了船。</p>
<p>這二十多個人在一艘船上，是很擠的了。不多一會兒，那給漸漸的移動，於是他們在寂靜的星夜中悄悄地離別了可愛的杭州。</p>
<h3>踢毽子</h3>
<p>— 韋華</p>
<p>前一週，次愷先生介紹了跳繩的運動給各位；今天我是來介紹另一種運動給各位的，那便是踢毽子。</p>
<p>小朋友讀過這樣的一課書嗎？</p>
<p>楊柳兒生，放風箏；</p>
<p>楊柳兒死，踢毽子；</p>
<p>楊柳兒彎彎，滾鐵環；</p>
<p>楊柳兒婆娑，抽陀螺！</p>
<p>就中放風箏一項，純粹是一種遊戲，雖然順便可以呼吸一些新鮮的空氣，可是還要受着天時的限制：一年只有春季適於放風箏，下雨天還要除外，况且在這個時候，上海的四週，佈滿了殺人的强盜，就是我們想要到郊野去放風箏，恐怕也是做不到的事！</p>
<p>再說滾鐵環吧！滾鐵環雖然能够使我們跑跳跑跳，是一種好的運動，可是又非有廣大的運動塲不可，在狹小的屋子裏，鐵環滾不到一會兒，就要碰壁，眞够氣悶，同時鐵環價錢很貴，頗不合算。</p>
<p>第三要說抽陀螺了，抽陀螺是一種呆板的遊戲，人站在一定的地方，不能跑跳；同時左手也不能運動，僅僅是右手動動而已。要是腰部久屈，還要發痛的。</p>
<p>只有踢毽子一項，才是頂好的運動，它能使身體各部肌肉發達，還能練習我們的視力，旣不需要很大的運動塲所，又不花什麽錢，春夏秋冬，天晴下雨，室內室外，無時不可，無地不能，眞是一項絕好的遊戲和運動！</p>
<p>數年前全國運動會，曾有踢毽子的表演，可見一般體育家和政治家，已經注意到踢毽子的好處了，因此極力提倡起來。</p>
<p>小朋友，你也不妨試試：看是否有趣？是否有益於身體？只需用一個穿眼銅錢，一塊小布，一根錢，就能做好一個毽子，如果能够用雞毛代布，就要美觀一些。</p>
<p>小朋友的小園地</p>
<h3>梅</h3>
<p>— 震東小學六年級生　馬元鏞</p>
<p>如今，春姑娘已穿著鮮艷奪目的雲裳，姗姗其來了，籬角邊的梅花，也受了春姑娘的撫慰，開起美麗的花來。</p>
<p>在往年我又得和爸爸到蘇州的鄧尉無錫的梅園去觀賞梅花。可是，曾幾何時，爸爸已在前年八一三淞滬之役爲國犧牲了·而山明水秀的故鄕——無錫也被鐵蹄蹂躪無遺。然而我還是緬懷着故鄕梅園的梅可無恙否？我懷着許多的意義，依舊疼愛着梅花，尤其是故鄉的梅花。</p>
<p>我不愛他的色香全備，獨愛他的品格高超，做人而能效法梅花，能具眞實學問，不尙虛榮，有傲骨，而無傲氣，能和堅冬厲雪狂風暴雨相肉博，那是梅花的偉大，無怪乎國人一致推重而尊爲國花了。</p>
<p>小朋友們，我們旣是國家未來的柱石，我們要具有和梅花一一樣的性格，大家努力吧！</p>
<h3>離別</h3>
<p>— 江西附小五年級生　陳錦珊</p>
<p>別了，我的故鄉，我親愛的故鄉。</p>
<p>當我走出這村口的時候，眼前只覺得沒有一樣是我所捨得下的，漸漸的走遠了，只見許多親朋揮着紅的白的手巾，好像一面面的國旗，在迎風飄蕩。</p>
<p>再會！再會！耳旁的鞭砲劈劈拍拍的響聲，同志們向我喊着再會，朋友，最後勝利必屬於我。</p>
<p>我的眼眶是潤溼了，我自知眼淚流滿了我的臉，這時候有一種說不出的感動，整齊的脚步，向前走着，「最後勝利必屬於我，」我深印在腦海中。</p>
<p>大道的二旁是黃土和焦草，過去幾座山，太陽正在露出一個頭來也似的來送我們一般，放出萬道光芒，照着小溪裏的波浪，好像頑皮小孩一樣的跳躍不停，照出一片閃爍金光。</p>
<p>別了，我的故鄉，我親愛的故鄕，我不忍別去了我的故鄕。但是我更不忍放棄了大時代中每個人應該做工作，又望了許多親愛的勇士，他們正在用他的熱血建造新的中國；我要是不負起一些責任，便是一個罪人。</p>
<p>我始終做忠勇將士的後援，把我的身體熱血來獻給我的國家，這是我的誓言。</p>
<h3>我的節約方法</h3>
<p>— 民智小學五年級生　蔣志明</p>
<p>金錢難是一種萬惡的東西，但宇宙間的人類大都賴以生存。况在此非常時期，家破人亡，無家可賺的人，不知其數。因此孤島上，難民收容所內，很是擁擠，他們極缺乏衣，食，的生活要素。這件事必須有多量金錢，始能解决：要想集成巨款，救濟他們，一定要節約，方能成功。</p>
<p>現在的我，正在消費時代，對於節約，當然不能有巨大的數目。好在節約是一種積少成多的辦法，並不限定多少。雖從父母那裏，僅能得少許的錢，然而每天也可以由零用上節省下來，以作儲蓄的款項。我的節約是採取銀行中零存整付的方法，分三個月爲一期，每期節銀一元，存諸銀行，必將儲蓄的數量，增加到相當的時期，不是有了較鉅的資金嗎？</p>
<p>朋友們！此種方法，不是輕而易舉嗎？你們如一天節約一分，三個月已有九角，這樣下來，就可節約不少資金，大則可捐給國家，小則亦可救濟難民，不是很好的辦法嗎？想小朋友們總贊成，而大家都肯實行吧！</p>
<h3>親愛的小朋友：</h3>
<p>— 石光源鞠躬二月廿四日</p>
<p>您們過年很快樂吧！您們的糖菓很多吧！吃不了的糖菜，請你們不要向地上扔，你們今天看報了嗎？報上說有好幾萬小朋友他們飯也吃不飽，衣也穿不暖，他們過年連一塊糖菓也沒有吃呀！請您們把吃不了的糖菜分給他們點吧！過年您們得了那麽多的壓歲錢，留他做什麽用？你們需要的柬西，你的爸爸自有錢給你買，請你們快把接到的壓歲錢，拿出來給苦難的小朋友們去買衣，買米和上學用吧！讓他們也和我們一樣的生活着。親愛的小朋友！請你們快捐吧1祝你們快樂</p>
<h3>白雪公主（九）</h3>
<p>— 天孫</p>
<p>快樂放聲答道：「他自己也不知道是什麽一回事，他也從來沒有試一試！」</p>
<p>這一切經過的情形，，未免太順流了，使老頑固很不滿意，總想尋些事情出來。於是他交义着兩條臂兒在胸前，很響喨的咳嗽起來，引起了每個人的注意。</p>
<p>他氣咕咕地說道：「這不是猜啞謎兒的時候，你們不要再嚕囌了！我們原知道我們自己是什麼人，但我們也該問：伊又是誰啊？」</p>
<p>白雪公主瞧r伊那種生氣的模樣兒，幾乎要笑將出來，然而伊竭力的忍住了，仍很莊重的說道：「我想我們還是從新來過，好像初見面時一樣。諸位先生，你們可好啊？我的名字是呌做白雪。」</p>
<p>「白雪麽？」</p>
<p>「可是白雪公主麽？」</p>
<p>白雪公主答應了一聲「是」，然後把這一天的種種經過吿知了他們。當初那獵官打發伊逃跑以後，一個人在森林中沒頭沒腦的亂跑，是何等的害怕。後來怎樣的遇見了鳥啊獸啊那些小動物，才領導伊到這座屋子裏來的。</p>
<p>但是白雪公主一提起了那王后，那七個矮人不知不覺地咽下了一口唾沫，十四隻脚在那七雙怀好頑的靴子裏抖顫起來，因爲他們早就聽得王后是一個怎樣殘酷的婦人，據說伊並且是一個鬼計多端的女巫，甚麼事情都會做得出來的。</p>
<p>末了還是老頑固代表他們把害怕的心理說將出來，他警吿着伙伴們道：「我們最好把這女孩子趕掉了，不要讓伊留在這裏。你們記着我的話，那王后要是知道了伊在這裹時，就得趕來把我們七個人一一殺死，我們大家都沒有命了。」</p>
<p>白雪公中即忙分辯道：「然而伊並不知道我是在什麼地方，伊决不會趕到這裹來找我的。」</p>
<p>老頑固低低地嘶聲說道：「哼，伊不會趕到這兒來找你嗎？俘是什麼都知道的，誰也瞞不過伊！伊并月還有隱身的法術，使人瞧不見伊的身子！這當兒也許伊就躱在這間房裏呢！」</p>
<p>那些矮人們聽了老頑固的話，眞個吃驚起來，一個個不住的在抖顫着，一面張大了眼睛，向這　晤暗的臥房亂張亂望，彷彿那王后眞的躱在四個壁角裏呢。</p>
<p>博士堅决地說道：「我說仍得留在這裹！」</p>
<p>老頑固咆哮着道：「我說伊得離開道裏！」</p>
<p>他們倆都現出一種堅决的神情，各不相讓，簡直要拔出拳頭，彼此打架了。</p>
<p>白雪公主看了這樣兒，很覺過意不去，連忙在一旁央求着道，。請你們兩位不要爲了我口角，傷了彼此的和氣，我立時離開這裹就是了·」說時，伊就移動身子，向着門口走去，一面伊叉含憂帶恨的說道：「我自己也未免太獃了，但我以爲留在這裏，也許有可以帮忙的地方。我以爲你們是一定需要我的。我倘留在這裏時可以給你們管管家事，洗洗東西啊，縫縫衣啊，煮煮菜啊——」</p>

<h3>Five Thousand Japanese Casualties in Central Hupeh - Chinese Army Counteroffensive Improving Situation - Yenmenkou and Sanyangtien Both Surrounded - China Guards Against Japanese Forces on Hanyi Road Advancing North Towards Hsiangfan - Japanese Troops Besieged by Great Fire in Shihlung, All Retreat</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The majority of the Japanese forces in Central Hupeh belong to the "16th" Division. After a week of bloody battles with the Chinese forces, casualties have reached four to five thousand. The Chinese forces have also suffered losses. The Chinese forces have launched counteroffensives in recent days, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese forces in various locations including Yenmenkou, Sanyangtien, Yihochi, and Yangchiaho. The overall situation is improving. Yenmenkou and Sanyangtien are both surrounded by Chinese forces. The Japanese are also reinforcing, and the fighting is expected to intensify. Japanese forces in Honan are also active. A large portion of the Japanese forces on the Lunghai Railway between Hsuchow belongs to the "31st" Division. Over ten thousand Japanese troops are stationed along the Taotsing Railway in northern Honan up to the banks of the Yellow River. Japanese forces in Chanchien and Yuanwu have been reinforced. Chinese troop strength at various points in central Honan has also been increased. The situation in Shansi is temporarily calm. Japanese forces in northern Kiangsi and northern Hunan are currently adopting a defensive posture, but are very busy with troop movements. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chungking) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese forces west of Hankow, after initially advancing west along the Hanyi Highway, have now drastically changed their route and are turning north. They appear to be intending to invade Hsiangyang and Fancheng in northern Hupeh. It is generally believed that these two locations are the gateway from the south into Shensi. The Japanese forces advancing west along the Chingchung Highway are now moving north, aiming to join forces to advance on Chungsiang. Japanese aircraft and artillery are concentrating on bombing Chinese positions at Sunchiao, attempting to destroy Chinese defensive works. Regarding the Kuling situation, Chinese sources state that the Japanese have been unsuccessful in driving out the Chinese guerrilla forces from key locations on the mountain. They are now intensifying the "blockade" of Kuling, attempting to cut off their food and military supplies. Japanese forces are constantly shelling the mountain. On the 2nd of this month, a Japanese aircraft circled over Kuling for an hour, dropping leaflets urging the Chinese forces to surrender. The situation east of Ichang is currently quite concerning, particularly in the Shahan area. Chinese forces are anticipating a strong Japanese offensive from the Kingshan and Suihsien frontlines towards Hsiangyang and Fancheng. This area is currently being heavily defended by Central Government troops, who will undoubtedly offer strong resistance. The local population has not yet evacuated and does not appear to be disturbed by the nearby activity. On February 21st, Ichang was bombed, with estimated casualties exceeding seven hundred. (4th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chungsiang: The Japanese forces in central Hupeh have reportedly been using lethal poison gas in recent days. However, the Chinese positions remain unshaken. Five to six hundred Japanese soldiers and over twenty tanks, after intruding into Liufangtsui, were heavily attacked by Chinese forces yesterday and have retreated to the vicinity of Sanyangtien today. Chinese forces north of Sanyangtien have resumed intense pressure today, and the Japanese forces are wavering. The Chingchung Road is one of the most critical sectors in the central Hupeh battles. Over two thousand Japanese soldiers are still fiercely fighting in the Sunchiao area. The Japanese forces on the Hanyi Road initially advanced with strong forces, showing a tendency to cross the river westward. After a Chinese counteroffensive, they no longer have the ability to actively advance. Four hundred or so Japanese troops in the Yuehkow area have been constructing fortifications for days, attempting to hold their ground. A certain unit of the Chinese forces has also been ambushing them on their flanks. (4th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Ichang) Since a certain unit of the Chinese forces launched a counteroffensive on Sanyangtien, it has been very successful. Over four hundred Japanese soldiers were killed near Chowtien, and a significant amount of weapons and ammunition was captured. Furthermore, a certain unit of the Chinese forces launched a counteroffensive on Liufangtsui, inflicting heavy casualties. The Japanese forces are fleeing towards Panchangling and Shangchiachung, and the Chinese forces are currently in pursuit. (4th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chungking) According to Chinese military dispatches received here, the Japanese forces in central Hupeh have not been able to make any new progress after days of fierce counteroffensives by the Chinese forces and are now actively reinforcing. A major bloody battle is expected to unfold in the area east of the Hanshui River. It is reported that the Japanese forces advancing along the Hanyi Highway, after reaching Liuchiasei on the east bank of the Kuohua River, have repeatedly attempted to attack Chiukow to the west. However, due to the flooding of the Kuohua River and the extremely muddy roads, the mechanized units are completely ineffective. Therefore, they have not been able to make any progress. On the Chingchung Highway, both sides are still stalemated at Chenchiachi, southeast of Chungsiang. On the northern route, fierce fighting has been taking place since yesterday at Hsintien, sixteen kilometers northeast of Suihsien. (4th Express News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankow) According to Japanese sources, Japanese forces have reached Chiukow on the Hanshui River. However, according to Chinese sources, the Japanese forces are still滞留 in the vicinity of Liuchiasei and have not reached Chiukow. Furthermore, the area occupied by the Japanese forces is currently unable to extricate itself from the flooding caused by the confluence of the Wo River and the Hanshui River. Their mechanized units are also deeply mired in the swamps. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, a small contingent of Japanese troops had infiltrated the vicinity of Chiukow but was severely attacked by General Feng Chih-an's troops, resulting in the elimination of over five hundred men. A Japanese team that secretly crossed the Hanshui River was also shelled by Chinese artillery, sinking numerous ships and causing many to drown. It is noted that Chiukow Town is the central point of the Yingcheng, Chingmen, and Chungsiang highways and is an important commercial hub in central Hupeh. All cotton produced in the surrounding area is traded and sold here. The town's residents, currently numbering over seven thousand, are all actively assisting the Chinese forces in combat. (4th Express News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A telegram from Huiyang states that the Japanese forces besieged in Shihlung have been gradually withdrawing recently due to the threat of Chinese guerrilla forces. According to scouts, the Japanese forces completely withdrew from the area one day. A large fire broke out in Shihlung that evening. According to foreign news reports, the fighting in the Tungkiang area was quiet on the 2nd. However, from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM on the 1st, there was a heavy artillery exchange between Chinese and Japanese forces between Lunghua Village and Lienho Market. Chinese aircraft appeared near the Canton-Huahsien Highway and reportedly dropped several bombs on the Japanese headquarters in the Tungshan Model Village. (4th 9:00 PM Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shaokuan: At dawn this morning, Chinese forces attacked Japanese forces near Lichiaolao in Tsengcheng. The Japanese forces responded with heavy artillery fire. Chinese troops continued to advance bravely. Intense fighting continued until noon. Heavy artillery fire was also heard in the Polo and Tungkuan areas. (4th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, a certain unit of the Chinese forces in Tungkiang launched a surprise attack on Shihma, east of the Changmukow railway station on the Canton-Kowloon Railway, at dawn yesterday morning. The Japanese forces responded hastily and suffered over two hundred killed. Subsequently, a large unit of Japanese reinforcements arrived, and the Chinese forces retreated eastward.

<h3>The Chinese Government Exerts All Efforts to Open Up Land Routes for Foreign Communication - Following Marco Polo's Old Route Back to Europe in the Southwest - Following the Highway Across Sinkiang in the Northwest and Laying Railways on Both Major Routes</h3>
<p>(Chungking) According to a statement made today to the Associated Press by the responsible Chinese transportation authority, the Chinese government is currently exerting all its efforts to open up land routes for foreign communication. In the southwest, China is establishing a foreign communication route following Marco Polo's (a Roman traveler who came to China in the 13th century) old route back to Europe. In the northwest, it is establishing contact with the outside world via the "route" that has existed in China since ancient times, namely, the highway across Sinkiang. Because China's coastal areas have been blockaded by the Japanese Navy, foreign communication routes are no longer passable, so it is necessary to follow the ancient routes that existed before the sea ban. In fact, before the sea ban, Chinese goods such as silk all reached the Near East and Europe via the Sinkiang route. This route has now been completely transformed into a modern highway, with a very solid roadbed. The majority of military supplies and other goods are coming from this route. As for the Yunnan-Burma Highway, which was entirely built by Chinese people, it was completed several months ago. Traffic on this road is now becoming more frequent. Missionaries from various countries are now mostly coming to China via this route. The spokesperson also said that Chinese have purchased over three thousand trucks with funds from the British and American loans, some of which have already arrived in China, while most of the remainder are en route to China. However, the spokesperson indicated that highways have four disadvantages compared to railways: (1) trucks are easily damaged when traveling on inland highways; (2) liquid fuels such as gasoline must be purchased from abroad; (3) the cost of transporting gasoline from coastal ports to the interior is extremely high; (4) trucks are far less efficient than trains for transporting goods. Due to these four disadvantages, the Chinese government is now making every effort to lay railways on these two major land transportation routes. The 860 kilometers from Yunnan to Burma and the 800 kilometers from Yunnan to Szechuan are currently under rapid construction. Observers say that before the 18th century, China's foreign communication never used the sea route. After this decision in the Sino-Japanese War, due to the full development of China's land transportation, foreign trade may not have to depend on the sea route. (3rd Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Promoting Transportation Between China and the Soviet Union - Testing Direct Air Services - Possible to Realize Postal and Passenger Services Between Chungking and Alma-Ata</h3>
<p>(Chungking) Direct air services for carrying mail and passengers between China and the Soviet Union are currently being arranged. In order to improve transportation between China and the Soviet Union, the authorities of both countries discussed the possibility of operating air services for carrying mail and passengers between Hankow and Alma-Ata last September. After several months of consultation, it has now been definitively decided to conduct test flights between Chungking and Alma-Ata. The entire route will be divided into two sections, with one section connecting Chungking and Hami in Sinkiang, and the second section connecting Hami and Alma-Ata. (4th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Two Puppets in Canton Assassinated</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Two low-ranking officials in the puppet government in Canton, under Japanese control, were assassinated here today by armed Chinese, setting a precedent for anti-Japanese terrorist activities in South China. It is reported that the strong men who carried out the assassinations inflicted fatal injuries on these two officials and then escaped without a trace. (3rd Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Palestine Question at the Present Stage</h3>
<p>The conference on the Palestine question, convened by Britain, has been underway since February 7th, almost a month ago. Because Britain has consistently refused to relinquish its rule over Palestine to the Arabs and has consistently refused to implement the Balfour Declaration for the Jews, despite lengthy discussions, not only has there been no result, but the situation has become deadlocked.</p>
<p>Palestine was originally the ancient Jewish kingdom and was later annexed by Turkey. During the European War, the Arabs of Palestine, trusting the British promise of independence, broke away from Turkish control. After the end of the war, it was designated as a League of Nations mandate territory, with the League of Nations entrusting Britain with its rule. However, after Britain's rule, not only did it go back on its word to the Arabs, but it also used various political measures to oppress them in various ways. On the other hand, it also exploited the Jewish "Zionism" movement, and according to the Balfour Declaration, feigned to allow the Jews to establish a "national homeland" in Palestine, encouraging Jews to immigrate to Palestine, creating hatred and conflict between the two ethnic groups, in order to divert the Arabs' hatred of Britain and consolidate its rule in Palestine. Under this encouragement, Jews from all over the world returned to live in the location of their ancestral homeland. After Germany launched its anti-Semitic movement, even more eagerly immigrated. Since 1920, the number of Jews who have immigrated has reached 400,000, accounting for 45% of the Arab population. These Jews are hardworking and thrifty and are good at accumulating wealth, so many of Palestine's industries have gradually come under their control. The Arabs are extremely frightened by this, and their fear has led to hatred, which has led to a strong anti-Jewish movement. In recent years, conflicts between the two ethnic groups have been constant, and the reason for this lies here.</p>
<p>In the past, Britain has always exploited the conflicts between these two ethnic groups to consolidate its rule over Palestine. However, recently, the struggle between these two ethnic groups has been exploited by Fascist Italy as a tool to threaten Britain, contend for hegemony in the Mediterranean, and expand its North African colonies. Originally, although Palestine is barren and the people are poor, and it is not very important commercially, its strategic position is very important for Britain. Britain must use great effort to manage it in order to guarantee the safety of its communications with the Near East and North African colonies. Because it is closely connected to the Suez Canal, it holds the important hub in Britain's connection with the Near East and North African colonies. After Italy annexed Abyssinia, gained power in the Red Sea, and instigated the Spanish Civil War, gaining an advantage in the Mediterranean, Britain's communication with the Near East and North African colonies was greatly threatened. Therefore, it was anxious to dig a canal within Palestine, starting from the port of Haifa on the Mediterranean coast, passing through the Dan River and the Dead Sea, and ending at the port of Aqaba on the Red Sea, so that even if the Suez Canal were destroyed or blockaded in the event of a war in the Mediterranean, its maritime communications with the Near East could still be maintained. In addition, it is also preparing to build a railway, connecting the port of Aqaba to the city of Ma'an, and connecting to the railway from the Mosul region to Medina, so that even if the Mosul region's oil pipelines were destroyed, the transportation of oil could still be maintained as usual. In this way, Britain's position in the Near East and North Africa will become increasingly consolidated, and Palestine can always remain attached to Britain.</p>
<p>This plan poses a considerable threat to Fascist Italy's ambition to dominate the Mediterranean and expand its North African colonies. Therefore, recently, it has repeatedly instigated the Arab anti-British movement and has also united with Germany to expand the anti-Semitic movement, making the Jews feel the pain of not having a country even more, thus working even harder for the Zionist movement, thereby indirectly increasing the hatred between Jews and Arabs, making it difficult for Britain's plans to be realized. Britain has seen this point and knows that if it continues to use its past policies, it will only create opportunities for Fascist Italy. Therefore, it wants to abandon its previous policies and convened representatives of the Jews and Arabs of Palestine to hold a conference, so that the two ethnic groups can each present their views, so as to find a compromise solution to avoid being harmed itself. Unfortunately, Britain has not abandoned its determination to rule Palestine and implement the Balfour Declaration, so it has been discussing for more than a month, but still without any results. We believe that the one who tied the bell must untie it. British gentlemen should thoroughly abandon their past policies, keep their promises, and seek a solution based on fair principles, helping them to establish independent and free countries. Only in this way can they give a major blow to the aggressors' coveting of the Mediterranean and North Africa!</p>
<h3>Third National Education Conference: Chairman Chiang's Address Emphasizes Taking Full Responsibility for National Salvation and Reconstruction, Upholding the Three Principles of the People as the Highest Standard for Education, and Promoting a National Spirit and Will of Resolute Resistance and Reconstruction</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang's address at the Third National Education Conference: Speaker, Vice-Speaker, esteemed colleagues, our first National Education Conference was convened in May of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], and the second in April of the 19th year of the Republic [1930]. This National Education Conference is being held more than eight years after the previous one. The convening of this conference is taking place during a period of active nationwide resistance against Japan and national reconstruction, so its mission is particularly significant. The task of this education conference is, of course, to examine the current state of education, research methods for improvement or remediation, and resolve the various difficult problems currently facing education. However, what I ask of all of you present is that you further recognize the needs of the Republic of China at this time, grasp the central issues in education, and, with full enthusiasm and sincerity, shoulder the responsibility of national salvation and reconstruction. This means that we must identify a definite goal for education: to take the revolutionary Three Principles of the People for national salvation as the highest standard of our country's education, implement the program of resistance against Japan and national reconstruction, and create a new, modern nation.</p>
<p>Developing the Economy and Strengthening Military Power</p>
<p>I often say that the vitality of a modern nation is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military power. Education is the foundation of all undertakings, and it can also be said that education is the central pivot connecting the economy and military power. Therefore, we must take developing the economy and strengthening military power as our educational policy. Especially during this period of resistance against Japan and national reconstruction, we must develop the economy to enrich the nation's strength during wartime and lay the foundation for national reconstruction after the war. We must also strengthen military power to defeat the enemy on the one hand and build the nation and its people on the other. We must create our China, a modern nation full of vitality and a promising future, from the various hardships and difficulties of wartime. Currently, the most heatedly debated issue in education is the issue of wartime education versus normal education; that is, should we break all formal systems, or should we maintain a normal education system while adopting methods suitable for this extraordinary period? Regarding this issue, my personal opinion is that the solution is very simple. In recent years, I have often said, "In peacetime, we must regard it as wartime; in wartime, we must regard it as peacetime." I also said, "Wartime life is modern life. In modern times, whether individual or society, if we cannot live wartime lives, we cannot exist and will be eliminated and perish." If we understand this meaning, we do not need to have the debate between normal education and wartime education. Because in the past, we failed to regard peacetime as wartime, many people now cannot regard wartime as peacetime. These two errors are closely connected. We must not say that all education can exist independently of the needs of the country, closing its doors and ignoring the external environment, even when foreign enemies are at the border, and still remain stable and not become tense. But we also cannot say that because it is wartime, all school courses and educational administration can be put aside; because it is wartime, we unconditionally drive all modern youth out of classrooms, laboratories, and research rooms and send them to other situations to do emergency work without choice or supervision. We need soldiers; when necessary, we may have to conscript professors or university students. We need various cadres for resistance against Japan. We cannot but set up various emergency talent training programs outside the usual education system. But at the same time, we also need highly skilled technical personnel in all fields and scholars with specialized research, and even more so during the period of resistance against Japan, we need to emphasize various basic education.</p>
<p>Frugality, Perseverance, and Expanded Effectiveness</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of the resistance against Japan and conform to the wartime environment, we should use methods appropriate for an extraordinary period to achieve the original purpose of education, and use extraordinary spirit to expand the effectiveness of education. This is what we should do. For example, schools at all levels, in wartime, should strive for frugality in equipment, simplicity in daily life, and perseverance. In the past, people drew on reeds to teach their children, using such simple teaching tools to educate famous people. They used fireflies for light and the reflection of snow to study, and did not give up reading. This is what our teachers and students should emulate during wartime. As for student training, there should be an expansion of the scope of subjects and a reduction of unnecessary courses. In terms of social education, we should make the most of the manpower of schools and institutions. These issues can be used as examples, and cannot be listed exhaustively. In short, we must not forget that wartime should be regarded as peacetime, and we must not neglect the basics for the sake of emergency needs. We are fighting this war not only to strive for national survival, but also to transform our nation and revive our country during this period. Therefore, our focus on education should not only be on wartime, but also on the post-war period. We must estimate what level our national knowledge and abilities should be raised to if we want our country to become a modern nation. To build our country into a modern nation, we need tens of thousands of specialized scholars, hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of technicians and engineers in various departments, and even more millions of teachers and cadres for public training. These must all be supplied by our education sector. These issues must be resolved by our education sector. Regarding all concrete program issues in education, I cannot bring them up for discussion.</p>
<p>Firmly Establish the National Will to Resist and Rebuild</p>
<p>What I hope you will focus on is the most fundamental point: to firmly establish our national will to resist Japan and build a positive spirit of national reconstruction. Even more so, we must constantly enhance the inherent morality of our nation. As everyone knows, we are a country lacking in all material conditions, and we are in such a dangerous and difficult period, yet we must shoulder such an extraordinary and enormous responsibility. If we do not overcome material things with spirit, we cannot achieve victory in the resistance against Japan. If we do not use our inherent morality and revolutionary spirit, if we do not generate effort and create material things from spirit, we will have no way to achieve the success of national reconstruction. Moreover, what the enemy is now seeking in every possible way is to strike at our spirit, overwhelm our spirit, and eliminate the inherent morality and revolutionary spirit of our nation, so that our national life has nothing to rely on. Therefore, the most urgent need at present is to invigorate and concentrate our spirit. Recently, the Central Government proposed the National Political Council and decided to implement the General Spiritual Mobilization, the purpose of which is to strengthen our national spirit to shoulder the era's mission of resistance against Japan and national reconstruction. Methods will soon be determined to promote it nationwide. I hope that all people in our national education sector will resolutely take on this important responsibility, lead by example, and advocate for all sectors to universally practice it. As the ancients said, "To transform the people and form customs must be done through learning." The words and actions of the education sector will invariably affect the social atmosphere. In the past few decades of the revolutionary movement, not one has not been greatly developed due to the enthusiastic advocacy of the education sector. Today, it is not just a question of revitalizing and reforming, but a question of survival or extinction. We must promote our inherent spirit and morality, arouse the national spirit of independence and self-esteem, awaken in the entire nation a sacrificial heart to share the hatred of the enemy who is invading and destroying us, and establish in the entire nation a deep sense of self-confidence in the revolutionary future and the nation's future. Then we can encourage the determination to move forward, actively strive, and fight, and then this vast and long-standing nation can give birth to a bright and brilliant new life from all the hardships. I believe that our country has reached today, and the life of a group of educators should no longer be the leisurely life of reading books behind closed doors as in the past. Educators should not only impart knowledge according to the curriculum, regarding it as a basis for personal life or a private profession. Today's educators should recognize themselves as frontline soldiers charging and breaking through the enemy, recognize themselves as social guides who change customs and habits, and recognize themselves as pioneers who pave the way. Today, we can no longer echo the slogan of educational independence, which has been misunderstood for a long time, and make educators stand outside the national laws and the responsibilities given by the nation, becoming an isolated group.</p>
<p>Education and Military and Political Affairs Should Be Integrated</p>
<p>I believe that today, when we talk about education, we should integrate education with military affairs, politics, society, and economy. How can we integrate education with military affairs? We must create in all students the awareness and ability to defend the country, defend themselves, and govern themselves and the country. Students who are not yet of age should be able to serve in the national army when they grow up. Students of age should be able to enlist in the army when the country needs them. When they are not conscripted, each person should have a skill that can be used for work related to resistance against Japan. How can we say that education is integrated with politics? The Book of Rites says, "Be a teacher first, then be a leader." In ancient times, teachers were the source from which political cadres at all levels came. Today, our educators should also take on the responsibility of training the people and organizing the people. How can we say that education is integrated with society? Recently, I have often heard school educators regard concurrently running social education as a difficult task. I believe that there should be appropriate consideration of funding, time, and energy, but fundamentally speaking, school education can never be separated from society. As the ancients said, "To assist each other and improve each other." Let's not say that our fellow countrymen are ignorant and suffering, we can never bear to ignore them. Even in order to achieve the purpose of education, we must prevent those who are near ink from being stained black, and we should develop the common sense of the people in society to improve the school environment. How can we say that education is integrated with the economy? This is even more a key point in our national reconstruction plan. We must, based on the needs of national economic construction, teach the people to value labor and be productive, especially encouraging the ability to create. All education plans should be coordinated with economic plans, and then our education can become a factor created by the vitality of a modern nation. (To be continued) (4th telegram)</p>

Regarding Vietnam, due to its great distance from mainland France, military factories have been established there, and the entire territory is being rapidly industrialized. In order to protect Vietnam, fearing that there will be a danger of attack by 200 aircraft from Siam, Japan's ally, in the event of a conflict with Japan, it has been decided to establish aircraft factories and to begin construction of indigenous engineering teams. At the same time, the Vietnamese army will also be increased from 18,000 to 38,000 men. (4th Haitong telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Pearl Industry in the South Seas Developing: Annual Sales to Europe and America Valued at 10 Million Yen</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Miyako Shimbun, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha plans to operate the 5,500-ton Bengal Maru ship on the South Seas route, with the aim of dispatching Japanese pearl divers to the area. It is said that the number of Japanese pearl divers working in the South Seas has increased in recent years. Their annual harvest from March to December is 3,000 to 4,000 tons of pearls and shells, and the annual export value of pearls to Europe and the United States is 10 million yen. The base of Japanese pearl divers is in Palau Island, under Japanese mandate. The number of workers on the island is currently 1,200. After the expansion of this industry, 1,000 more people will be needed. Because those engaged in this business are flocking to the island, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's ships sailing to the area have been overcrowded on every voyage recently. It is said that there are currently a large number of pearl divers in Palau and other South Seas islands preparing for the start of the pearl harvesting season. (3rd Reuters telegram)</p>

<h3>U.S. Defense Expansion Plan: Army and Air Force Budgets Passed by the House of Representatives, to Enhance Defense of Hawaii and the Panama Canal; New Neutrality Legislation to be Reviewed by the Senate Soon</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to President Roosevelt's defense message presented on August 12th of this year, the total expenditure required for the naval, army, and air force expansion plan is $552,000,000. The army portion accounts for $450,000,000, which includes the $300,000,000 needed for the air force. This portion has now been amended and passed by the House of Representatives by a show of hands. The original appropriation of $450,000,000 has been increased to $499,857,936, and it has already been transferred to the Senate for discussion. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives has today passed the $499,857,936 budget proposed by the War Department. The bill has now been sent to the Senate for discussion. This bill is separate from President Roosevelt's $357,000,000 emergency defense appropriation. Its main purpose is to strengthen the army's defensive fortifications in Hawaii and the Panama Canal area. Therefore, although it has its specific uses, it complements the Vinson Naval Base Bill and the Emergency Defense Appropriation Bill. According to this bill, the War Department will also spend as much as $6 million to strengthen the defense of Hawaii. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Before the War Department budget was passed in the House of Representatives today, Democratic Congressman Collins stated that it was rumored that a certain country (largely referring to Germany) had established an air force that exceeded the sum total of all other countries' air forces. If the military attachés of the U.S. embassies in various countries were unaware of this, it would be tantamount to holding a position without performing its duties. He suggested they should be dismissed. Another report stated that the navy's plan to build a large airship of a special metal at a cost of three million would be temporarily postponed. According to the prices quoted by the Goodyear and Zeppelin companies, a giant airship of 3,000,000 cubic feet would cost $2,940,350, while a smaller one would cost $760,916.

The naval authorities paid particular attention to the results of the new combat performances. Although the report after this review will not be published, the navy is undoubtedly satisfied with the results of the exercises. In addition, although the scale of this review was large, the damage was less than in the past. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>British Government Promises to Support Arab Independence; Important Documents from Eighteen Years Ago Released; Palestinian Conference Still Deadlocked</h3>
<p>London In response to repeated requests from the Arabs, the British government yesterday published ten letters exchanged between British High Commissioner McMahon and Sharif Hussein of Mecca between July 1915 and March 1916. These letters indicate that the British government had promised to support the establishment of an Arab state as early as 1915, two years before the Balfour Declaration. The letters are accompanied by a colored map of pre-war Asia Minor. Among the letters, two are particularly important. One is the six proposals submitted by Hussein on behalf of the Arabs on January 14, 1915:</p>
<p>(1) Britain recognizes the Arab state, its boundaries extending from the Persian border to the Bay of Basra south of the Indian Ocean, excluding Aden and the Red Sea to the west, as well as the Mediterranean coast. Britain recognizes the establishment of an Arab king. (2) Britain enjoys priority in all economic enterprises in Arabia. (3) Military mutual assistance. If a war breaks out, peace can only be concluded with the consent of both Britain and Arabia. (4) If one of the two countries is involved in an invasion conflict, the other country must at least remain neutral. (5) Britain agrees to abolish the privileges enjoyed by other countries in Arab countries and assists the Arab King's government in promoting its work through international agreements. (6) Articles 3 and 4 are valid for fifteen years. The second important letter is McMahon's letter to Hussein on October 24, 1915, after several exchanges of correspondence, which includes the following five points: (1) Britain is willing to recognize and support the independence of the Arab regions designated by the Sharif of Mecca. (2) Britain is willing to protect the holy sites, prevent all external attacks, and recognize their inviolability. (3) Under appropriate circumstances, Britain is willing to grant the Arabs full powers and support them in organizing the most suitable government. (4) The Arabs agree to accept only British guidance and advice, and appoint only British personnel as consultants for the establishment of a good administrative system. (5) As for the region of Vilayet between Baghdad and Basra in Iraq, the Arabs recognize Britain's special interests. At the same time, to prevent external attacks, ensure the welfare of the people, and promote the economic interests of both parties, Britain should maintain a special administrative system.</p>
<p>McMahon also explained this five-point plan, saying that it could prove Britain's sympathy and become a strong and lasting bond. The most immediate effect is to eliminate Turkish influence and liberate the Arab people under Turkish rule. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) It is claimed here that the differences in the wording contained in the new full text are purely verbal. The Arabs contend that Sir Henry McMahon stated that the Arab independence Britain was prepared to recognize and support also included Palestine within its boundaries. Political circles here emphasized that the British government was committed to acknowledging this point. The British view was stated by Churchill when he was Colonial Secretary in 1922. He said that the promise was subject to a reservation, excluding certain parts of Syrian land west of the Damascus area. The British government has always considered this reservation to include the Vilayet of Beirut and the entire independent Sanjak of Jerusalem. Therefore, all of Palestine west of the Jordan River was not covered by Sir Henry McMahon's pledge. It is also important that Sir Henry himself wrote to the press in July 1937, stating that he did not intend to include Palestine in the pledge he made to the Arabs. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Palestine issue, British government representative MacDonald continued talks with Jewish representatives this afternoon. Jewish sources here claim that "the talks have reached a deadlock." The British side stated that a compromise may or may not be reached. According to well-informed sources, MacDonald made a new proposal to Weizmann today to preserve the dignity of the Jewish community. The Jewish delegation is scheduled to meet on the 6th to decide whether to continue talks with the British representatives. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Steinhardt Transferred; U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Consent Obtained from Moscow</h3>

Steinhardt himself initially served as Minister to Sweden during Roosevelt's administration, before being promoted to Ambassador to Peru. He is quite capable. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Polish Diplomatic Strategy; Attempts to Establish Neutral Bloc; Prevent German Expansion Eastward; Proposal for Polish-Hungarian Border Not Abandoned</h3>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources here recently stated that when Italian Foreign Minister Ciano held talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck some time ago, the Polish government did not abandon its proposal for a common border with Hungary. This has been confirmed. Poland also wants to unite the countries of Central Europe, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea coast in the south, to form a "Neutral Bloc," creating a "Third Axis" to prevent communism from invading the West and Germany from expanding eastward. In addition, Poland does not endorse the policies pursued by the Berlin-Rome political axis, and the Polish government is well aware that the interests of Italy and Poland diverge on several points. In this regard, Foreign Minister Gafencu of Romania's visit to Warsaw deserves attention. Colonel Beck visited Romania in October of last year, before the border between Czechoslovakia and Hungary had been demarcated, and asked the country to support the "Third Axis," but without success. To this day, Poland and Romania are both threatened by Germany's eastward expansion policy. Although they do not dare to openly offend that country, they are also eager to find security guarantees. This is why Poland has improved relations with the Soviet Union and maintained its alliance with France. As for Romania, it also wants to seek assistance from the democratic countries of Western Europe to offset German influence. Therefore, the diplomatic authorities of Poland and Romania should try to increase cooperation during their talks. It can be asserted. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Visits Warsaw; Review of General Situation and Promotion of Economic Relations</h3>

At noon, he was entertained at a banquet hosted by Staczynski, the Speaker of the Warsaw City Council. In the evening, he will be hosted at a dinner by Foreign Minister Beck. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is scheduled to visit here today and hold talks with Foreign Minister Beck to discuss the general situation in Europe, the situation in the Danube region, the promotion of economic relations between Poland and Romania, and the treatment of Jews. Regarding the Danube issue, Germany recently rejoined the International Commission for the Navigation of the Danube. Poland also intends to follow suit and send representatives to participate, based on the grounds that Poland has no less economic and political interests in the Danube than Hungary. Poland's exports via the river are also substantial. Regarding the issue of promoting economic relations between Poland and Romania, the respective cabinet members will consider a plan to jointly develop a canal from Poland's Vistula River through Romania to the Danube River. Poland also wants to promote closer economic relations between Romania and Hungary. It is heard that the Little Entente, as a positive political factor, will be able to facilitate this. As for the Jewish issue, Poland and Romania are in similar positions and are willing to seek a way out for the Jews in their countries, so that they can be resettled abroad. They will often take joint action internationally. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Increase in Italian and French Troops; British Quite Concerned About North African Territories</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French magazine "Ce Soir" recently revealed Foreign Minister Bonnet's statement to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies regarding France's military measures in Tunis. It is claimed that France's defense plan in Tunis is ready. A division of border troops in Tunis has been transferred from Algiers, along with several squadrons of aircraft. Therefore, they will be prepared for any contingency. The local authorities have also notified residents to remain calm in the event of an incident. The newspaper also stated that France's current military strength in Tunis is stronger than Italy's troops in Tripolitania. It further said that Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier has made various preparations and can issue a mobilization order in mid-March if the situation requires it. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>London After the Italian government repeatedly increased its troops on the border of its Libyan colony in North Africa, its total military strength is now equivalent to the number of troops stationed in French Tunisia. Responsible individuals here are extremely concerned after hearing this, and they say that Italy has concentrated a batch of bombers on the Libyan border and has recently dispatched more aircraft there. Italian Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Bastianini admitted to British Ambassador Perth when they met some time ago that the number of troops stationed in Libya had indeed been increased, and said that Italy would send more troops to Libya in response to the threat of France's repeated troop increases in Tunisia. This move is clearly intended to intimidate Italy when Prime Minister Mussolini makes various demands on France. What is worrisome is that France and Italy have amassed large numbers of troops in the border areas of Libya and Tunisia, which could easily lead to incidents at any time. If Italy can shift the responsibility to France at that time, Germany may provide military assistance to Italy, which is not out of the question. It is rumored that the French government has now decided to withdraw the Tunisian border defense line a few kilometers inland. If this is true, the British government will welcome it. At the same time, it will invoke the Anglo-Italian Agreement and urge the Italian government to reduce the number of troops stationed in Libya to avoid causing further tension.

<h3>Soviet Union Decides to Withdraw Representative from Non-Intervention Committee; Believes That the Committee No Longer Has Meaning; Peterson Appointed British Ambassador to Spain</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union resolved on the 1st to recall its representative to the London Non-Intervention Committee, as the committee has long ceased to function and its existence is meaningless. (Tass dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) After the Soviet government decided to withdraw its delegation to the Spanish Non-Intervention Policy Adjustment Committee, well-informed sources here commented that from the beginning of the Adjustment Committee's establishment, the Soviet government had doubted whether the decisions it adopted would be effective or whether they would be made in good faith. However, because there was still some credibility in the collective security system, and to prove that the Soviet Union was not substantially interfering in the Spanish civil war, and to assist the Spanish Republican government to the extent possible, it continued to participate. At this point, Britain and France have recognized the Nationalist government as the legitimate government of Spain, and the Soviet Union must withdraw its delegation, which is inevitable and should not be taken as unusual. Apart from this, the Soviet government will still recognize the Spanish Republican government as the only legitimate government. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) After the Soviet government decided to withdraw its representative from the Spanish Non-Intervention Committee, diplomatic circles here commented that the Soviet government had been in arrears with its dues for several months. Almost all of the committee's expenses were shared by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. The Soviet Union's declaration of withdrawal is not of great importance. Although Britain and France have recognized the Nationalist government as the legitimate government of Spain, the original position of the Adjustment Committee has not changed and it will continue to exist until the end of the civil war in Spain. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) According to an official announcement, Sir Peterson, the current British Ambassador to Baghdad and former Chargé d'Affaires in Madrid, has been appointed as the British Ambassador to Spain. Peterson joined the diplomatic service in 1913 and has served in Washington, Prague, Tokyo, Cairo, and Madrid. He served as Balfour's private secretary at the Washington Conference from 1921 to 1922. He served as Acting Commissioner for Egypt in 1934 and as Minister to Bulgaria from 1936 to 1938. He was appointed Ambassador to Iraq in 1938. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The date of French Ambassador to Burgos General Pétain's assumption of his new post has not yet been determined. However, political figures claim that General Pétain may depart for Spain on March 11. The reason for the delay in assuming his post is the accommodation issues faced by his large embassy staff.

<h3>Gandhi's Fast Begins: Advanced Age and Frail Body Cause Concern for Attending Physicians; Strikes and Market Closures Occur Throughout India</h3>
<p>Bombay: Today, Gandhi is lying in a simply furnished room in Rajkot, determined to fast until the ruler of Rajkot resolves the situation caused by the recent conflict between Hindus and Muslims. He has telegraphed the Inspector General of Police of India, Linlithgow, requesting his intervention in this dispute. Also, a general strike is being observed throughout India today. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Rajkot, India, has been tense for six weeks. Yesterday, the news of Gandhi's fast further exacerbated the situation. It is said that the local Rajkot official, Sahebai, had promised Gandhi to implement a new constitution based on democratic principles, but has so far failed to fulfill his promise. Gandhi then sent a letter to Sahebai stating that if a satisfactory reply was not received by yesterday morning, he would begin fasting. Sahebai did not respond, so Gandhi is now fasting. Residents throughout Rajkot have staged a 24-hour strike or market closure to show their sympathy for Gandhi. People in London believe that Gandhi, now in his seventies and already physically weak, may suffer serious consequences from this fast. If something untoward happens, the people of Rajkot will likely riot unless Sahebai makes concessions, in which case the situation will inevitably escalate. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>Rajkot: On the first day of Gandhi's fourth major fast, he lay on a simple cot in his room, which was furnished with only unadorned furniture. Gandhi's sister, aged 75, visited him today and spoke with him earnestly for an hour. This determined family reunion occurred with only his closest comrades present, making for a particularly moving scene. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rajkot: A medical bulletin released here today stated that Gandhi's spirits are still good after 24 hours of fasting, and he has not shown any signs of collapse. A doctor told a Reuters reporter that Gandhi's heart is weaker than it was last Sunday, and given his age and physical condition, extreme caution is necessary. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Bombay: The Provincial Government Assembly has telegraphed the Governor-General of India, Marquess Linlithgow, requesting mediation in the dispute that has led to Gandhi's fast. The Bombay Congress has called for a three-day voluntary "Non-Selling League." The so-called "Non-Selling League" is a type of boycott movement used in India. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bombay: The cotton market and stock exchange here were both closed today due to Gandhi's fast. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>New Delhi: There is widespread concern here about the consequences of Gandhi's fast. A British-run newspaper called "The Statesman" today published an editorial stating that the Rajkot issue is clearly one that should be intervened in by the highest authority for the welfare of all the people, and that the ruler of Rajkot should be immediately dismissed. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>New Delhi: Although the news of Gandhi's fast has caused great concern here, the current official view is that Gandhi's actions stem from a dispute with the King of Rajkot, and that there is no question of the Governor-General intervening with his authority. Official sources dismiss as speculation the possibility that Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, will shorten his trip to 共拉吉普太那 due to Gandhi's fast. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Actively Develop Sichuan and Xikang; Organization of the Promotion Association and Inspection Team Established; Speaker of the Senate Designates Members and Inspectors</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) During the third session of the National Senate, the Speaker proposed that, after the adjournment of this session, senators familiar with the situation in Sichuan and Xikang and with special knowledge and experience in various construction projects should be immediately organized into the National Senate's Sichuan-Xikang Development Promotion Association. The Promotion Association would form a Sichuan-Xikang Development Inspection Team to immediately travel to Sichuan and Xikang to inspect various locations, and, based on the inspection results, formulate a Sichuan-Xikang development plan to be recommended to the government for adoption and implementation. The Assembly resolved to pass the original proposal. However, the "Visiting Team" was renamed "Inspection Team." The selection of personnel, inspection items, and the question of whether the Inspection Team should invite external experts to participate, were all authorized to be decided by the Speaker. It is reported that the organization of the Sichuan-Xikang Development Promotion Association and the Inspection Team has been determined by the Speaker in accordance with the resolution of the Assembly. Senators Shao Congen, Zhang Lan, Li Huang, Zeng Qi, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Yan Yangchu, Wu Yuzhang, Chen Baoyin, Hu Jingyi, Fan Rui, Yang Duanliu, Gao Xibing, and Xu Xiaonian, a total of fourteen people, have been designated as members of the Sichuan-Xikang Development Promotion Association. Li Huang, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Lan, Lin Hu, Ma Liang, Gao Xibing, Mo Dehui, Guang Sheng, Hu Jingyi, Wang Jinxin, Huang Yuren, Yu Jiaju, Wang Zhixin, Yao Zhongliang, Deng Feihuang, Zhang Jianwu, Liu Shumo, Zhang Bojun, Xi Lun, and Yang Ziyi, a total of twenty-one people, have been designated as members of the Inspection Team, and Li Huang has been designated as the head of the Inspection Team, and Huang Yanpei as the deputy head. The main points of the organization of the Sichuan-Xikang Development Promotion Association and the Inspection Team are attached below: 1. The Sichuan-Xikang Development Promotion Association shall be organized by fifteen senators designated by the Speaker. 2. The Speaker shall be the Chairman of the Promotion Association. 3. The task of the Promotion Association is to urge the government to promote the development of Sichuan and Xikang in order to enhance the strength of the war of resistance and national construction. 4. The Inspection Team shall be composed of fifteen to twenty-one senators designated by the Speaker.

The Inspection Team shall have a head and a deputy head, each designated by the Speaker from among the team members. 6. The task of the Inspection Team is to go to Sichuan and Xikang to inspect the actual situation, prepare a report on the findings, and submit concrete opinions on the development of Sichuan and Xikang, which shall be sent to the Promotion Association. The Promotion Association shall formulate a development plan based on the report and opinions, and recommend it for adoption and implementation. 7. The inspection by the Inspection Team should focus on the four major categories of administration, military service, public security, and people's livelihood. The details of each category shall be formulated by the Promotion Association. 8. The Inspection Team may be divided into several groups by the Promotion Association, with each group inspecting a specific area. 9. The Inspection Team may, through the Speaker, request government agencies to assign personnel to participate in and assist, with a limit of ten people. 10. Before the Inspection Team departs, the Speaker shall consult with the government and order the local government to provide assistance to the inspection work at any time. 11. The inspection period of the Inspection Team shall be two months. 12. During the inspection period, the Inspection Team may, at any time, convey its findings to the government through letters and telegrams to the Speaker. 13.

The Inspection Team's expenses shall be allocated by the government upon consultation with the Speaker. (Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in China: No Need for Large-Scale Increase, Says Itagaki</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of War Itagaki Seishiro declared yesterday before a plenary session of the Budget Committee of the Lower House that the current situation in China does not require a large-scale increase in Japanese troops. However, the fact that this year's extraordinary military budget is equal to last year's is due to the need to replenish military supplies and maintain order in the occupied areas. Itagaki continued that the Japanese army in China will soon dispatch new troops to replace them. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Sino-British Negotiations: Cotton Cloth Order; Value Approximately £500,000; Payment Method Not Yet Agreed</h3>
<p>(London) The Chinese government's plan to order 20 million yards of cotton cloth from the UK, worth at least £500,000, has been under negotiation, and many cloth factories have also offered prices. However, the payment method for this transaction has not yet been agreed upon, so the Lancashire cotton industry is increasingly concerned that Britain will lose this large deal and hopes that the Export Credits Guarantee Department will assist so that Lancashire can obtain this order. However, according to news from the Manchester Royal Exchange, there is currently no progress on this matter. If the Chinese government cannot obtain the necessary facilities, it will place orders with the United States or elsewhere. If this statement is true, the cotton factories will be greatly disappointed, as this order could keep hundreds of cotton workers employed for at least six months. At the same time, domestic cotton goods transactions in the UK have made considerable progress, and demand from South America, Europe, and British colonies is also more active than before, so the Lancashire textile industry is gradually becoming optimistic about the future. Many cotton mills that had suspended operations are now preparing to start work to meet the revived demand. Yarn factories are using an average of 50,000 bales of cotton per week, which is the highest amount in a year. Yarn factories are also selling more forward yarn. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Relationship Between Italy and Albania Deteriorates; London Expresses Anxiety</h3>
<p>(London) Following a sudden deterioration in relations between Italy and Albania, well-informed sources here are very anxious, fearing that Italy may use military intervention against Albania under the pretext of maintaining public order. It is reported that King Zog I of Albania preemptively mobilized a batch of reservists on the 15th of last month and sent troops to the Mirditë region to suppress a brewing fascist rebellion. On the 19th of the same month, he ordered the arrest of the rebel leaders and escorted Major Gil, the leader of the Albanian Fascist Youth League, to Durrës and ordered him to board a ship to Italy. Upon hearing the news, the Italian authorities only requested the release of those arrested and took no other action. Although the Albanian authorities complied on the 23rd of last month, Italy also granted the country a credit loan as a reward. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Volunteer Army Comes to Zhejiang to Participate in the War</h3>
<p>Jinhua Correspondent: Li Youbang, leader of the Taiwan Independence Revolutionary Party, is traveling through Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangxi to promote the participation of Taiwanese compatriots in the motherland's war of resistance. He decided last month to go from Jinhua to Fujian to discuss the Taiwan Volunteer Corps. When he arrived in Chong'an, many Taiwanese people enthusiastically signed up to participate. He personally led Guo Ruhou and 24 others from Chong'an at the end of last month, passing through Pucheng, Jiangshan, and arriving in Jinhua. Many of the team members are doctors or have special skills. According to Li, more people will continue to come north afterwards. Once negotiations with the authorities are finalized, they can be dispatched to work on the front lines.</p>
<h3>Military Discipline Inspection Team Completes Inspection of All of Zhejiang; Several Cases of Corruption Uncovered</h3>
<p>Jinhua Correspondent: The first team of the Military Discipline Inspection Team of the Military Affairs Commission departed earlier in two groups to inspect. One group went to inspect Ningbo, Taizhou, and other areas under Yan Shao, and the other group went to inspect various counties in the Chu, Wenzhou, and Quzhou areas. They have now completed their inspections one after another and returned to Jinhua. The Military Affairs Commission has additionally appointed Fang Zhi and Li Zhengle as members of the team. Li is a member of the Central Supervisory Yuan and a native of Suiyuan. He came to Zhejiang earlier and accompanied Director Jin Handing to Ningbo and Taizhou to participate in the inspection. Fang, because he is also the Director of Education of Anhui, recently sent a telegram from Anhui stating that educational affairs still need to be handled and that he needs to delay his arrival in Jinhua. The members of the team are currently sorting out the materials obtained in order to report to the Military Affairs Commission. Yesterday, a member of the team talked about the inspection process, roughly saying that during this trip, they saw that the conscription work in various counties was generally more advanced, and the increase in willing soldiers proved the high level of anti-Japanese sentiment among the people. The training teams in various counties are very active, but the level and ability of the training personnel are slightly lacking. The reorganization of the Baojia system and the investigation of household registration are progressing diligently, and the general township heads have received considerable training, which is a good phenomenon for the area. Other issues, such as the declining physical fitness of the people in the Wenzhou and Chu areas, are issues that we should pay attention to. In terms of education, although elementary schools in various counties are still open as usual, due to excessive financial shortages and a lack of teachers, increasing the salaries of elementary school teachers is indeed an urgent need at present. The handicraft guidance centers and cooperative businesses run by the Construction Department are both able to meet the needs of the people. Finally, regarding the administrative talents in various local agencies, there is not enough attention to the personal cultivation of civil servants, and work cannot be done practically. Cases of corruption among agency staff have also been uncovered recently and will be dealt with severely according to the law after the investigation procedures for the entire case are completed. The team still needs to stay in Zhejiang for a considerable period of time before inspecting the Jiangxi province.</p>
<h3>U.S. Movement to Ban the Shipment of War Materials to Japan; Stimson and Others Participate and Preside; Public Rally Held in San Francisco; American Celebrities and Anna May Wong Attend</h3>
<p>Special Air Mail Report from the Continental Daily News, San Francisco: In the past three months, picket lines have been formed in San Francisco, Long Beach, Portland, and Seattle to stop ships carrying scrap iron and war materials to Japan. This kind of demonstration, unless it makes the American people aware that most of Japan's war materials are shipped from the United States, the movement itself cannot succeed. However, with the assistance of American friends of China and mostly with the assistance of organized labor, the efforts of the overseas Chinese on the Pacific coast of the United States have stirred up American public opinion to support the movement to amend the neutrality law and embargo Japan. One expression of American public opinion is the distribution of petitions to Congress, demanding an immediate embargo on all war materials to the aggressor nation, Japan. On the Pacific coast, the petitioners were the Federation of Churches in Seattle and the Chinese Patriotic Association in Portland. When the movement spread to San Francisco, the Federation of Churches took the lead in initiating this area.</p>
<p>Embargo Movement: American public opinion immediately approved several methods of "isolating the aggressor nations." In view of the fact that the entire United States supported the picket line actions on the San Francisco waterfront in December of last year, the United China Relief Association convened a propaganda conference on the entire Pacific coast in San Francisco. The conference was held on January 10th and 15th. Representatives from eleven cities on the Pacific coast attended to discuss opinions and methods on the embargo movement. The association was fortunate to have three Americans who were most enthusiastic about the embargo movement as consultants. These three were Dr. Haskell, National Director of the China Aid Council, Norden, Executive Secretary of the National Committee to Boycott Japanese Aggression, and Torrance, Public Relations Director of the Anti-Japanese Goods Federation. They provided great assistance in encouraging and guiding representatives and cooperating with the American people to form a united front for peace and civil rights. San Francisco port is the birthplace of the movement to embargo war materials to Japan throughout the United States. San Francisco is the most important city on the American Pacific coast. The largest number of Chinese living in the United States are in this area, and "Wall Street of the American West" is also in this city. The San Francisco Federation of Churches took the lead in convening a city-wide committee to protest the shipment of military supplies to Japan. The committee is composed of seventy-five civic, labor, women's, and religious organizations in the city and is chaired by the Reverend 卞列克, who was recently elected president of the Federation of Churches, and the well-known lawyer and newspaper publisher Schell Borman as Executive Director. It is unprecedented in civic life to have such a perfect union to support a movement of international importance such as the embargo on war materials to Japan. On February 9th, a mass rally was held at the Dreamland Auditorium. Speakers included Mr. 台尔, Geneva correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, Dr. Lowell of the San Francisco Record, author Norris, California Senator Shelley, and movie star Anna May Wong. The citizens of San Francisco have become the testing ground for American public opinion against the continuous bombing and massacre of Chinese civilians. A continuous committee and a permanent group have now been formed, chaired by Mr. 皮莱氏, to carry out this movement. The American Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression, chaired by Stimson and led by such celebrities as former Harvard University President Lowell and White, has already begun this movement. Mr. White told reporters that the entire United States is now viewing San Francisco port as a barometer of public opinion on stopping the shipment of war materials to Japan.</p>
<h3>Western Border Inspection Notes: Walking on Steep Cliffs, White Clouds Rise Beneath Our Feet; Mountains and Fields Spread into Xikang; Sledge Ascends Peaks on Rugged Roads; Crossing Iron Chain Bridges Over the Luding River</h3>
<p>Kangding Correspondence: Daxiangling is a must-pass for going from Southern Sichuan to Kangding. There is a stone-paved official road in the mountains, which was built by Zhao Erfeng during the Qing Dynasty when he was preparing the border. The mountain is 3,800 meters above sea level, with overlapping peaks and many forests.</p>
<p>Passing through Hanyuan County: The reporter arrived at Fuxingchang, at the foot of Daxiangling Mountain, on the evening of the 20th. The next morning at 7 o'clock, the sedan chair carriers urged us to set off. Because of a light rain overnight, the mountain road was wet and slippery. At this time, it was densely overcast, the fog was hazy, and the chaotic mountains rose and fell, making it impossible to distinguish east from west. After crossing two small iron chain bridges, we gradually entered a secluded mountain area. The mountains on both sides undulated, and the ravines in the middle were deep. Strange rocks were jagged, and the water flowed through them, sobbing and deafening. The mountain slopes were mixed with bamboo and trees, and the whole mountain was lush and green. Walking and walking again, we gradually entered a steep slope. The sedan chair carriers' panting and the creaking sound of the sedan chair echoed each other. At this point, the reporter got out of the sedan chair and walked, climbing for about a li, and was already sweating profusely. After taking off my leather coat, I was still panting. On both sides of the stone path, there were patches of accumulated snow, and the weather gradually became cold. When we reached Xiaoguanshan, we rested and had a snack, and continued to move forward. The mountain became more and more steep. People walked on the steep cliffs, with white clouds rising beneath our feet. At this time, the mountains were covered with snow, the silver color dazzling the eyes, and the clouds and fog were vast, filling the mountain passes, making the snow color even more desolate, with the general feeling of "thousands of mountains with no birds flying, ten thousand valleys with no human trace." People with weak eyesight are prone to 雪　 in this situation, so travelers mostly wear dark glasses. After walking ten li, we reached Daguanshan. At this time, the mud and water on the stone path had frozen into solid ice, and icicles hung from the rocks, reaching several feet in length. The weather was even colder, and most of the thirty or so people traveling with us were unbearably cold, as they were already in a world of ice and snow. Going forward again, the sound of the stream was not heard, and all sounds were silent. Looking up in all directions, we knew that we had reached the top of the mountain. The peak turned and the road turned, and we circled along the mountainside, not knowing how many times. The peaks stood tall, all in the snow and fog. Along the way, travelers came and went in an endless stream, with those selling lingzhi and medicine being the most numerous. The tea boxes were mostly carried by people, and the medicine bags were mostly carried on the backs of donkeys and horses. The bells of the livestock rang clearly in the mountain paths, never ceasing. After passing Manpozi and passing Changlaoping, we reached the highest peak of Daxiangling. At that time, the clouds, fog, and snow made it impossible to distinguish anything clearly. The opposite peaks were all in the misty clouds. Looking down into the deep ravines, it was like an abyss of ten thousand feet, making one tremble with fear. From the foot of the mountain to here, we had traveled 45 li, all uphill. Ahead was the downhill, passing through twenty-four bends, with a rugged and winding path. The mountain wind was very strong, but because it was on the sunny side of the mountain, there was little snow, and the road surface was as dry as usual. After going downhill for ten li, we reached Yangquanmen, and had arrived at Daxiangling. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at Hanyuan County. We stayed in the city that night. Hanyuan was originally named Qingxi County. The city was built on a hilltop, and the climate was colder. The city was desolate, with many open spaces. Because of the high mountains on all sides, the wind was very strong. There is a saying: "Qingfeng Yayu." On the morning of the 22nd, we left Hanyuan from the west gate and crossed Menghugang. The mountain was treacherous. Looking back at Hanyuan, all the houses in the city were in sight. From here westward, the peaks along the way stretched continuously, undulating endlessly, and were all bare mountains, making them even more desolate. After passing Lengfangou and Fuzhuang Douliuzi, we arrived at Nitou at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. The town is also known as Yidong. It was once Feiyue County. The town is very small and has troops stationed there. We stayed there that night. The next morning, we set off for Feiyueling. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Travel Correspondence from Eastern Zhejiang (2) Singing Awakens the People of Eastern Zhejiang to Defend Greater Zhejiang! Yiwu and Dongyang Have Perilous Terrain; Yongkang Has Well-Developed Public Education</h3>
<p>Leaving Zhuji and heading west to Yiwu, the sides of the road were full of winding, undulating mountains, with beautiful, prominent peaks, clear and lovely, making people forget all their sorrows.</p>
<p>Yiwu Scenery The city of Yiwu is not prosperous. There are only two hotels next to the train station in the suburbs, and the facilities are very simple. Yiwu County is connected to Dongyang and Yongkang, with Zhuji to the north, and Jinhua and Wuyi counties to the southwest. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway passes through the middle of its county seat from Zhuji to Jinhua, so in terms of terrain, Yiwu County is in the center and belongs to a very important area. The total area of the county is 4,441 square kilometers, but the total population is 299,239, so the average population density per square kilometer is 7 more than Zhuji, at 68 people. There are 87,400 farmers in Yiwu. The annual ordinary agricultural output is 2,565,250 dan, less than half of that of Zhuji, but the county's rural sideline industries are more developed, such as making brown sugar and beekeeping. In terms of special agricultural products, tobacco can produce more than 37,000 zu annually, with an annual output of more than 45,200 dan, most of which is exported. The training of able-bodied men is also in full swing. There are more than 59,000 able-bodied men in the county, and it is estimated that one-third have been trained. The reporter visited the county's public education center and asked about the local people's organization for the War of Resistance. It was reported that after the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on August 13, wartime knowledge classes were organized to gather the people to attend lectures, instructing them on the knowledge they should have during wartime. Regarding wartime work in the four townships, in addition to being presided over by the various branch centers, personnel were also dispatched to various districts of the urban area for propaganda. The Yiwu Public Education Center has good facilities. There is a bulletin board in front of the center, reporting the brief war situation of the day. Behind the center, there is a sports field with basketball and small football facilities for the people to exercise in their spare time. Inside the center, there is a small lecture hall, and upstairs there is a library. The reporter went up to visit and found that the space was very spacious, accommodating forty or fifty people for reading. The center has many books and a reading area, with newspapers published from various places and magazines related to the War of Resistance displayed on the shelves, with two staff members specializing in lending books and other matters. A Glimpse of Dongyang After staying in Yiwu for two nights, I took a car to Dongyang County. The Yidong Highway is 18.2 kilometers long, the road surface is wide and flat, and all the road bridges are also very solid. The car arrived at Dongyang Station in two hours. Although the total area of Dongyang County is 9,585 square kilometers, most of it is mountainous and not suitable for cultivation. The total population of the county is more than 466,400, and the average population density per square kilometer is only 49 people. Many people are engaged in handicrafts, as many as 90,000. Because the children of rural Dongyang County are skilled in crafts, many people work in other provinces in industries such as papermaking, sewing, cement, and textiles, and are found all over Southeast Asia, which shows that the people of the county are quite adventurous. Agriculture in Dongyang County is not developed. The annual output of ordinary crops in the county is only about one million dan, so there is little export. The annual output of special agricultural products such as tea is also about 10,000 dan. The sideline industry of farmers in the countryside is known for making cured ham, so Dongyang's ham is actually better than Jinhua's, and the number exported to various places every year is very large. According to locals, since the outbreak of the war, the county's tea production and ham have still been the main exports. Because transportation is slightly hindered, local transportation and production and sales cooperatives have been established to help farmers transport and sell their products. The most prosperous area of Dongyang County is a long street leading directly to the county government, but the street is very narrow, and it is very dark even during the day. The street is paved with stone, uneven. There is a county-run junior high school in the city. We went to visit. The school has more than 300 students and more than 20 teachers. The teachers and students are very cooperative in the work of resisting Japan. There is a bulletin board for war news in the school, as well as propaganda and first aid work. When the reporter returned, he saw a group of people standing at the street entrance, reading a newly published war bulletin on the wall. The prominent red characters and large headlines with large circles were enough to attract attention. This kind of bulletin was published immediately when important news was received. The source of the news was from radio stations in various places, so it was very accurate and quick, allowing everyone in the city to know. This economical and effective reporting method seems particularly suitable in small cities, and it is indeed commendable and worth imitating. Songs Everywhere "Defend Greater Zhejiang" This song seems to be sung by everyone in Zhejiang. We can hear people singing or humming everywhere: "Pick up the murderous sickles, axes, and earthen cannons to defend our parents, brothers, sisters, lives, property, fields, and land. Arm and defend Greater Zhejiang." This cannot help but make people admire the power of these youth salvation propaganda groups. They have actually taught every Zhejiang person to sing this song. This spirit is valuable. On the car from Dongyang to Fangyan, there were several young students who sang this song with great vigor. The people in the car were all satisfied, and no one came out to stop them. The purpose of going to Fangyan was to visit Shoushan and Wufeng Academy. Fangyan belongs to Yongkang County. To get to Fangyan, you must first go to Shiya Bus Station, and then transfer to reach it. Fangyan is usually a quiet place, without a market town. Most of the local residents are very poor. The fields are all on the mountains, and irrigation is not convenient. Women rely on making umbrellas and embroidery to make a living. Every year in the eighth and ninth months of the lunar calendar, the Hugong Temple on Fangyan Mountain has a pilgrimage, with people from all counties in eastern and western Zhejiang and the border between Jiangxi and Zhejiang coming here to burn incense, one after another. It is said that at least a thousand people come to the mountain every day, so there are more than ten hotels and dozens of incense shops on the main street below the mountain. Most of them are closed on weekdays, but since the war, due to inconvenient transportation, pilgrims have also stopped coming. At the same time, tens of thousands of yuan of expenses per year can also be saved as a result. The reporter stayed at the Wufeng Academy Hostel, which was built with funds from the former Zhejiang Provincial Scenic Spot Preservation Committee. Wufeng Academy was built according to the lack of stone caves, so there is no roof on the second floor, only natural cave stones to cover it. It is said that before the war, many people came here to escape the summer heat every summer. The reporter asked the administrator of the hostel about the local residents' attitudes towards the War of Resistance. According to him, in addition to the county government sending people to promote it, the local area has a very small population and no organization, but everyone's mood for saving the country is quite intense. On the day of the decision, I returned to Shiya and waited for the bus to Yongkang. Yongkang County has a population of 200,000, of which more than 52,000 are able-bodied men, accounting for more than one-quarter of the total population. The local authorities are actively recruiting and training them. Most of the people in Yongkang are engaged in agriculture. According to the county government's survey, there are currently 69,000 farmers, and very few are engaged in business, only 8,554. The general level of knowledge of the people in Yongkang is very high. Most of the residents in the urban area have attended literacy schools, and there are few out-of-school children in the county. Of the 5,663 school-age children, the majority of 32,843 have attended school. There is also a county-run junior high school, divided into six grades, with more than 200 students, more than 40 normal school students, and 20 teachers in the entire school. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Work Consultation Office Registering Specialized Technicians, Introducing Them to Jobs Separately</h3>
<p>Since December 8th of last year, the Specialized Technical Work Consultation Office of the Central Construction and Education Cooperation Committee has begun to register specialized technicians. As of now, nearly 300 people have applied for registration, mostly specialized talents in agriculture, industry, commerce, and science who have withdrawn from the war zone, and newly graduated university students, with very few in literature and law. In order to facilitate the registration of people from other places, the office has also formulated communication registration methods. More than 180 people have now passed the examination. In addition to the office directly introducing them to jobs, which has already happened in several cases, the Central Construction and Education Cooperation Committee has been asked to send them to various ministries and commissions of the Central Government for distribution to their subordinate agencies for appropriate employment, or to introduce them to special training classes established by various agencies. Recently, a cooperation method has been agreed upon with the Chongqing Vocational Guidance Institute to seek more effective development in the introduction of work.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Refugee Production and Education Expenses Deeply Supported by All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Education Group Fundraising Committee's campaign to raise funds for refugee production and education expenses has been participated in by the entire education and cultural circles of the city, and has also been deeply supported by other sectors. The fundraising results in recent days have exceeded the predetermined target of 100,000 yuan. Yesterday, the association received 1,000 yuan in national currency from the Chinese and Western colleagues of Taikoo Company, because Mr. Yang Meinan resigned from the position of Chinese Manager, which was originally intended as parting money, to be used for the purchase of souvenirs. Mr. Yang, concerned about the refugees, returned the money and asked it to be transferred to the association, and Mr. Mitchell agreed to allocate the money to refugee production and education expenses. The association has specially replied to express its gratitude. In addition, the colleagues of the Lixin and Gongxin accounting firms also each donated 100 yuan. Other law firms and accounting firms will also follow suit. All sectors donate one yuan to the Shanghai Bank, and the bank will give a Leshan badge, with incremental donations, and no separate receipts will be issued. These Leshan badges are all donated by all sectors willingly, and will never be sold to the outside world. Please pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Xi Qingheng's Radio Speech Xi Yushu's son, Xi Qingheng, the Director of the Education Group, is only eleven years old. Yesterday, he gave a radio speech at the Xinxin Radio Station. The original words are as follows: Everyone, I am a student at Zhengfeng Middle School. My name is Xi Qingheng. I have never been good at speeches, so please forgive me if I say something wrong. The topic I am going to talk about today is "Fundraising for Refugee Production and Education Expenses." This matter is very important. The refugees now are all affected by the war and are accommodated in various refugee camps. Especially the promising young people have lost the opportunity to study. We young people living in Shanghai are safe and our studies are not wasted. We are very lucky. We should not let our studies be wasted. We should have compassion for them and hope that they will not become lazy people. Enthusiastic people in the education and cultural circles in Shanghai have now launched a campaign to raise funds for refugee production and education expenses. On the one hand, they want to enable the displaced refugees to produce, and on the other hand, they want to enable the young people who have been affected by the disaster and lost the opportunity to study to receive education. We must know that the refugees now rely entirely on a few enthusiastic people in society to help them. This is only doing the "raising" work. There are at least 100,000 refugees in Shanghai, of which more than 30,000 are children, according to the investigation report. Everyone thinks that there are so many refugees and refugee children that it is not enough to rely solely on relief. Moreover, many philanthropists can only do their best to help them when they are in distress. In the future, when the overall situation is stable, they will still not be "settled." Therefore, this refugee production and education is really the best way to help the refugees. In terms of this method, first, all refugees can acquire a skill; second, refugees can support themselves after acquiring a skill; third, refugees can get a decent job after the war and maintain their lives; fourth, all refugee children have the opportunity to study like us. Looking at it this way, this refugee production and education is really urgent. But economy is the mother of fact. If we want to run this kind of education, it is estimated that we need 100,000 yuan of funding. Therefore, we have launched a fundraising campaign. The fundraising methods have been published in the newspapers, so I don't need to go into detail. Generally, if you donate one yuan, you can get a "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy" medal. This is a very valuable thing, especially to encourage us young people who are studying. Everyone should not have useless expenses in this abolished Lunar New Year, save money and use it as donations, turn useless into useful. Isn't this a good opportunity? Moreover, it is only by encouraging students to do good deeds that benefit the people and are enthusiastic about public welfare that the meaning of education is truly realized. Students, let us all rise up now and work together to make this a good way to completely help the refugees. I hope that all wise parents and knowledgeable people in society will join hands to support this great movement to raise funds for refugee production and education. Done.</p>
<p>Proposal from the Secondary School Association Regarding the fundraising campaign for the Refugee Production and Education Fund in the Shanghai education community, which has been launched since March 1, it has achieved considerable success, and it is not difficult to reach the predetermined target. The Shanghai Secondary School Association suggests that the Shanghai Citizen Relief Association should set up a Refugee Production and Education Design Committee or Planning Committee to specialize in this matter. It is reported that the Association hopes that the entire education community in the city will provide as many concrete opinions as possible and submit them to the Association in writing for reference.

<h3>Preferential Treatment for Children of Soldiers Going to War in All Schools in This City Free of Charge Upon Proof</h3>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, the Central Government has formulated regulations and issued them to various places for implementation in order to give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers going to war against the enemy. It is now known that the measures have been revised and reissued. According to Article 7 of the regulations, families of soldiers going to war against the enemy who are unable to educate their children may request relief from the local preferential treatment committee. However, the situation in this city is rather special, and there are quite a few who voluntarily join the military service in the inland. There are also quite a few who are unable to attend school due to the war. The education community in this city has paid attention to these children. If it can be proven that they are indeed the children of soldiers going to war, they can enjoy free preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>Education Community Preparing to Celebrate Children's Day Passing Constitution and Personnel</h3>

<h3>Opinions on Reforming Education in the Shanghai Education Community Some Issues Concerning the Reform of the National Language Course (2)</h3>
<p>— Yang Jinhao</p>
<p>(4) The teaching materials should have a unit combination, which can not only arouse the interest of learners in association, but also enable learners to obtain complete knowledge. However, it is not very good to use the writing style as the standard for dividing units like "New China National Language," because learners are reading three or four articles of the same writing style in a certain period, without any adjustment, and often feel very boring. The Ministry of Education stipulates that senior high school Chinese should be compiled according to the system of literary history, so it should be divided into units with literary history as the standard. There are also many difficulties in this, because the selection of materials from ancient to modern times, the depth of writing style and the level of the grade are reversed, which is an inconvenience. At the same time, in order to adhere to the system of literary history, learners have no opportunity to continue to read famous articles outside the scope, which also seems to lack adjustment. Most ordinary national language compilation is divided into units with problems as the standard, which is a relatively suitable method. The various famous articles surrounding a certain problem are combined into a unit, so that learners can thoroughly understand this problem, which is both interesting and easy to remember. Moreover, they can also take this opportunity to appreciate various different writing or expression methods. As for the common sense teaching materials as supplements, author biographies, style descriptions, or explanations of the topics, grammar, rhetoric, etc. can be attached at the end of the text. If it is really necessary to enable learners to obtain knowledge of the entire system of literary history, academic history, etc., it is better to establish another course.</p>
<p>(5) The main thing about national language teaching materials is to read carefully as a model writing style. Therefore, if there are any places in the original text that must be selected that do not conform to grammar or the writing is clumsy, it may be revised or embellished to make it a standard article. If necessary, it can be noted at the end of the text. At the same time, carefully reading teaching materials must be easy to recite and memorize. Therefore, if the original text is too long, it should be appropriately deleted and shortened. In addition, attention must be paid to the content of the article, which should have profound insights, pure emotions, and an active spirit. All frivolous, empty, absurd, and boring works, even if they are popular for a while, should be discarded. The style of the article should be sincere, correct, and realistic. Although a few famous satirical, humorous, romantic, and sad articles can also be selected, sharp, reckless, arrogant, and decadent works must be excluded.</p>
<p>(6) The knowledge that learners gain from carefully reading teaching materials is limited, so it should be supplemented with slightly broader teaching materials. Ordinary schools separately designate certain extracurricular reading materials, which are uniformly purchased by all learners in the grade. I think it is best to divide the slightly broader teaching materials into two categories. One category can select articles that are related to the carefully read teaching materials and are relatively simple, and compile them at the end of each lesson or unit, so that the two are connected, to arouse the learners' interest and facilitate the learners' understanding. At the same time, after reading by all the students, a collective discussion can be conducted. The other category includes several important newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets. Learners should each identify and purchase one, and establish a grade-level circulation library for mutual exchange and borrowing, so that they can see many books and newspapers at a very small price.</p>
<p>(7) In order to save the learners' energy, all new words, difficult sentences, allusions, etc. should be appended with annotations at the end of the text. However, some national language textbooks often omit the annotations for points that are difficult to understand, or only note the source without adding an explanation. As a result, although annotations are attached, they are actually equivalent to not annotating. Here, I would like to ask the editors of the national language textbooks to use a little more hard work, or simply put aside articles that they have not been able to thoroughly understand for the time being. At the same time, I would also like to ask the National Language Review Committee of the Ministry of Education to carefully mark the errors, wrong annotations, and the bottom drafts that annotate the easy but not the difficult in detail, otherwise it will be too difficult for the national language teachers.</p>
<p>Third, Teaching Methods</p>
<p>Regarding the explanation and explanation of the teaching materials, the main idea of the paragraph, the discussion of the problem, etc., it is best for the learners to take the initiative and the teacher to assist, to cultivate the learners' habit of being willing to put in effort, thinking and solving problems. Here, there are a few points that should be paid attention to, which will be discussed later.</p>
<p>(1) Analyze the author's life experience and historical background to explore the meaning of the text. For example, if Du Fu's "The Ballad of the Army Carts" is explained from the aspects of his poor life, the endless wars during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, and the suffering of the people, it will naturally make learners more interested and able to appreciate it. Moreover, from this, it can also be further explained that this poem is not an absolute anti-war literature, but an anti-war article under the aggressive war.</p>
<p>(2) Expand the meaning of the text and relate it to the new reality. For example, Mo Di's "Against Aggression," the "Zizi Stops Chu from Attacking Song" in Strategies of the Warring States (can be attached with Liang Qichao's "Mozi's Environment and the Source of His Theory" and "Mozi's Fundamental Concept - Universal Love" as slightly broader teaching materials), and Du Fu's "The Ballad of the Army Carts" can be made into a unit. Through them, the sin of modern aggressive war can be explained, the need to stop aggression with strong diplomacy can be elaborated, and the people's grievances in the aggressive country can be cited. Then, Weng Zhaotan's "Just War," Zhang Binglin's "Letter to the 19th Route Army Defending Against Japan," and Ding Shujing and others' "Epitaph for the Tombstone of Nameless Heroes" can be selected to explain the necessity of the anti-aggression self-defense war of small and weak nations, to prove that the weak can overcome the strong in the War of Resistance because of the people's hard work and support, and to encourage the graduates not to forget to avenge their shame and resist insults, and to contribute money and effort. In the War of Resistance, there are also several kinds of people, such as Wu Sangui's traitor, Shi Kefa's loyal minister, and Yan History's hero. Then, "Biography of Yuanyuan" and "Ballad of Yuanyuan," "Letter to Shi Kefa, Minister of the Ming Dynasty," "Reply to Dorgon," and Shao Chenheng's "Biography of Yan History" can be selected. Recently, Mr. Hu Shanyuan's book "Ming Loyalty Series" (of which "Biography of Righteous People of Jiangyin" has been published by World Bookstore) wrote about many anti-Japanese martyrs among the people, which can be used as slightly broader materials. For example, from Sima Guang's "Battle of Chibi," we can talk about the united front, from Sima Qian's "Biography of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru," we can talk about unity and unification, from Zuo Qiuming's "King Goujian of Yue Destroys Wu," we can talk about the political facilities and military tactics of overcoming the strong with the weak. Many ancient articles have great lessons for today. When teaching and reading, it is more meaningful to combine the meaning of the text with reality. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>School Overview: Second Middle School Chinese Vocational Supplementary School</h3>
<p>For over a decade, the Chinese Vocational Education Society has spared no effort in promoting vocational supplementary education. The Second Chinese Vocational Supplementary School, affiliated with the society, has been established for eight years and has taken it upon itself to research and experiment with methods and teaching materials for vocational supplementary education. Its educational policy focuses on commercial supplementary education, aiming to cultivate outstanding talents in the business world. In addition to imparting practical knowledge and skills for vocational applications, it pays special attention to the ideological and behavioral training of young employees. On one hand, it utilizes collective living to guide students in gaining practical experience and applicable knowledge; on the other hand, it cultivates students' thinking and establishes a healthy vocational outlook on life. Therefore, although the school has a large number of students, they are united, act in a focused manner, and have a unified will. This can be seen from the expansion of the school's student self-government activities and the achievements in assisting social causes. The school has held moral cultivation lectures every week for the past eight years without interruption. Based on its practical experiences, it has authored over 500,000 words of youth moral cultivation reading materials, divided into three volumes: "Service and Cultivation," "Service and Life," "The Life of Struggle," and "Youth and Leadership." These books have been successively published by the Commercial Press and the World Book Company, enjoying nationwide popularity and even reaching overseas. Many secondary schools and industrial institutions have adopted them as teaching materials for youth training. With this diligent spirit, the school has won the sympathy of the Shanghai vocational community and the trust of young employees. Companies such as the Commercial Press, Sino-Western Dispensary, World Book Company, China Insurance Company, China National Goods Company, Home Industries Society, China Chemical Industries Society, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Customs Club, Xinhua Bank, Shanghai Telegraph Office, and Sincere Company have successively sponsored young employees to receive vocational training at the school. In the past year, despite repeated relocations of the school site, the student body remains extremely crowded. The school also provides supplementary education for young employees of old-fashioned shops, especially by setting up a shop assistants' class after 9:00 PM every night, with tuition fees of only one and a half yuan per semester, in line with the principle of popularization.</p>

<h3>CYC Members Basketball Tournament: 16 Teams Participating, Divided into Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage Groups, Opening on the 10th of This Month</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Student Tennis Team: A Record of the Expedition to Hong Kong and Macau (I)</h3>
<p>Li Guofan and Tang Baojia, the previous grass tennis doubles champions, along with their comrades Wei Zhenyu, Cai Guoji, Xu Peizhi, and others, took advantage of the winter vacation to organize a Shanghai student tennis team to travel to Hong Kong and Macau. Mr. Tang served as the captain, and the group consisted of five people. (Xu Peizhi was unable to travel with the team because the winter vacation at Shanghai University was later. He boarded the President Coolidge on February 4th to Hong Kong.) Led by team leader Jiang Jiehe, they left Shanghai on January 26th aboard the Canadian Empress. This newspaper presented them with team uniforms to boost their morale. After arriving in Hong Kong, they competed against famous players from various local clubs. Although the results were mixed, it was commendable that a purely student tennis team achieved such results. The team returned to Shanghai on the French Post's President Doumer on the 18th of last month.</p>
<p>The first match was against the University of Hong Kong. This match was the team's opening act and was held at the University of Hong Kong's court at 2:30 PM on the 4th. In the first singles match, Tang Baojia easily defeated Huang Jinxi, the university's champion, in straight sets. In the second singles match, Li Guofan and the third singles match, Zhang Zhenxing, both won against Ma Chaozhuang and Wang Xianbi by two to one. In the first doubles match, Li and Tang faced Wang and Ma. The two sides were evenly matched and competed fiercely. The first set went to twenty games before a winner was decided. Li and Tang eventually won by two to one. In the second doubles match, Wei and Cai faced Wang and Ling. Wang and Ling were completely defeated in the first set. Wei and Cai won the second set after a hard fight. Overall, the student team won against the University of Hong Kong by five to zero.</p>
<p>The second match was against the South China Athletic Association. The second match was against the South China Athletic Association, held at the Kowloon Recreation Ground at 2:30 PM on the 5th. The Shanghai team originally intended to have Li Guofan play the first singles match, but the opponent's first singles player, Chen Zhiqiang, wanted to compete against Tang Baojia. Therefore, Little Tang was still chosen to lead the way. As a result, Little Tang lost both sets with a score of three to six, three to six, which was quite strange. In the second singles match, Li Guofan defeated Huang Funan without much effort. In the third singles match, Zhang Zhenxing was defeated due to underestimating his opponent, Chen Jinman, whose skills were mediocre. Li and Tang still played in the first doubles match. The first doubles team was changed to Xu Peizhi and Cai Guoji to partner with Li and Tang. Li and Tang won, while Xu and Cai lost. Xu arrived in Hong Kong the day before and had not recovered from the fatigue, resulting in poor performance and defeat. Overall, South China won by three to two, which was quite lucky.</p>
<p>The third match was against the Portuguese team. The third match was against the Portuguese Athletic Association, held at the Kowloon Association's court on the 7th. Only three matches were played as exhibition matches. In the first match, Li and Tang faced Remi and Huang Saifu. When Tang first came on, his technique was chaotic, and he lost the first set by one to six. Then he unleashed his power and won the next two sets. After the match, he played two exhibition sets with Lei Gong. Ji. Tang continued his efforts and won again with scores of six to three and seven to five. In the second match, Zhang and Cai defeated Da Gaoshan Slave and Li Medushi by two to one. In the third match, the Shanghai team sent Xu Peizhi and temporarily invited Mr. Wang to help out. The opponents were Pai Luosi and Pai Laituo. Both sides had tense moments. The two Pais won by two to one. Overall, the Shanghai team triumphed by two to one.</p>

<h3>The Contents of the Compromise Reached Between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese Side: Four Key Points, Announcement of the Communiqué by the Japanese Consul, the Shanghai Municipal Council Still Retains Police Powers, the Shanghai Municipal Council Also Agrees to Add Japanese Detectives and Japanese Police Officers to the Japanese Police Division</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that according to senior officials of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) and the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) to reporters yesterday (the 3rd), after recent talks between SMP and the Japanese Consulate's police officers, an understanding has been reached: both sides will cooperate to curb terrorist activities in the International Settlement. The talks discussed practical ways to combat the rampant terrorist crimes in Shanghai and agreed on a joint policy of action. The SMP did not announce the details of this policy, as it felt that publicizing its plans at this stage would only help terrorist groups in the International Settlement and other areas to evade any action taken after both sides reached an understanding. Although the talks ended on Wednesday, it is expected that both sides will soon prepare for further meetings to discuss details of combating terrorism. After recent discussions on the police front, Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, visited Mr. Miura, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, yesterday afternoon for discussions. At 8:30 PM last night, the Japanese Consulate-General issued a communiqué stating that the "main points" of the compromise are as follows: (1) Strict implementation of the SMP's emergency proclamation regarding the transfer of armed criminals. (2) Effective cooperation between the SMP and the Japanese military police and the consulate's police department to protect Japanese nationals and prevent terrorist activities. (3) As stipulated in Article 2, (a) Effective control of illegal elements entering the International Settlement from the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek, (b) Searching Chinese passers-by at important locations in the International Settlement. (4) Adding personnel to the SMP's Japanese Police Division. The communiqué also stated that unless faithfully implemented, any agreement is merely a scrap of paper.</p>
<p>The China Press reports that after prolonged meetings and repeated exchanges of documents between the SMC and the Japanese authorities, a compromise has been reached, containing the essence and key points of which is that the SMP retains the sole right to arrest and enforce the law in the International Settlement in all cases affecting foreigners who do not enjoy extraterritorial jurisdiction. As reported in yesterday's (3rd) newspaper, the incident involving the International Settlement's administrative body and the Japanese side has been resolved peacefully. The Japanese Consulate-General confirmed at 8:30 PM last night that a hard-earned compromise had been reached. According to the information contained in the Japanese communiqué, the SMC retains its police powers, and the SMP's policy on methods to curb terrorism here will not undergo drastic changes. Last night, informed sources in Shanghai said that they believed that the incident, which once threatened the administrative integrity of the International Settlement due to Japanese demands, has now ended to the satisfaction of both the International Settlement and the Japanese authorities. This compromise also stipulates the strict implementation of the SMC's emergency proclamation. Regarding this particular point, the Japanese communiqué stated that the above-mentioned SMC proclamation stipulates "the transfer of criminals." However, observers stated last night that the exact wording of the SMC's emergency regulations differs slightly from the impression gained from reading the Japanese communiqué. On this point, a section of the proclamation states, "Anyone who commits a crime that endangers the armed forces stationed in the International Settlement will be handed over to the relevant stationed forces." The consular communiqué also stated that it has now been agreed to add Japanese police officers to the SMP's Japanese Police Division. Another point that is by no means novel is that the SMP will cooperate effectively with the Japanese military and the consulate's police department, and it stipulates that Chinese passers-by will be searched at important locations in the International Settlement. The communiqué further stated that the SMC and Japanese representatives had met twice yesterday before the final compromise was reached on this issue. At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, accompanied by Mr. Philips, Secretary-General, and Mr. Akagi, Deputy Secretary-General, visited Mr. Miura, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai. After urgent consultations between the Japanese army, navy, and consulate personnel, Mr. Miura, accompanied by Colonel Hirota and Consul Sato, visited Mr. Fessenden at the SMC at 6:30 PM in the afternoon. Since the issue of the Japanese side requesting the SMP to prevent terrorist cases on February 15th arose, it had once become serious. The most recent incident was on February 19th, when the puppet "Foreign Minister" Chen Lu was shot dead in his Shanghai residence. Three days later, Miura visited Fessenden with army and navy officers, demanding that measures be taken immediately to reduce such actions. According to the communiqué, the SMP's response was "not entirely satisfactory." The Japanese side then took a second diplomatic step on February 28th, with Japanese police authorities holding talks with the heads of the SMP regarding concrete and detailed measures for the proposed cooperation. While Japanese citizens here and in Japan once urged the Japanese army to move freely within the International Settlement south of the Suzhou Creek, London declared its support for the SMC and insisted on the inviolability of the International Settlement. However, two days ago, the SMC and the Japanese authorities reached an agreement in principle on everything, avoiding a dangerous situation. Last night, the Japanese consular communiqué praised this harmony, considering it "a sincere support for the SMC and the Japanese authorities to cooperate in maintaining peace and order in Shanghai. We earnestly hope that the unwanted tension caused by recent terrorist activities will not re-emerge in a brighter Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Imported Ships Should Be Subject to Quarantine: Harbor Master Issues a Circular, Ordering Shipping Companies to Fill Out Reports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Customs Harbor Master, for the purpose of quarantining passengers on imported ships, issued a circular this morning stating, "The matter of all imported ships being subject to quarantine upon arrival in Shanghai was announced in Notice No. 4 on March 28, 1938. A format for filling out passenger manifests is now specifically prescribed, which is attached to the circular for use by all shipping companies to fill out and submit to the inspectors. All items listed in the form must be filled out in detail for both first-class and cabin passengers. For steerage passengers, only the total number of men and women need to be specified separately."</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Launch a Surprise Attack on Zhuanqiao: Japanese Troops in Punan Intercepted: A Thousand Japanese Troops Are Trapped: The Situation in the Southern Section of Punan Is Serious</h3>
<p>The 45th Brigade of the regular army, led by Xu Xinzhou, launched a surprise attack on the Japanese troops stationed in Zhuanqiao Town at around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday. The Japanese troops were awakened from their dreams and fought back in a hurry. For a time, the sound of gunfire was deafening. After the Japanese troops in Beiqiao heard the news, a large force rushed to the scene. Seeing that their mission was completed, Xu's troops retreated to their original defense. In this battle, three Japanese soldiers were killed and two rifles were seized. The Chinese side also sacrificed one martyr and two were wounded. The Japanese troops in Tinglin Town, Punan, after being defeated by the guerrillas and surrounded without being able to escape, the Japanese troops in Songjiang sent reinforcements. According to villagers who detoured to Shanghai on foot the day before yesterday, the reinforcements were also intercepted by troops from the 60th Division of the Chinese regular army near Yexie and Songyin, forming three sections, all of which were surrounded by a large number of Chinese troops and engaged in fierce fighting. Therefore, 300 Japanese troops were transferred from Minhang, Puxi, and crossed the river to Nanqiao, intending to occupy Nanqiao to relieve the siege of Tinglin. However, they were blocked by guerrillas at the edge of Nanqiao City and surrounded, cutting off the Xiaotang section of the road along Punan. The 45th Brigade of the regular army, led by Xu Xinzhou, also occupied the strategic positions of Sanqijiao at Tangkou, Zha Gang, and Dujia Hang in Punan, threatening with troops. The Japanese troops were already in a large encirclement by the Chinese army. At the same time, the Japanese troops in Minhang, Puxi, were already empty, and the Chinese garrison near Guangang, the guerrilla base a short distance away, was quite strong. Therefore, the total number of Japanese troops who invaded Punan and were surrounded was around a thousand. The General Headquarters of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, in order to rescue the five sections of Japanese troops surrounded, has mobilized all the Japanese troops from Nanshi and Pudong. The section of the Huangpu River, starting from Longhuawan, has been placed under martial law.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Currency Flows into Shanghai: Exceeding 20,000 Yuan: Counterfeit Currency from the Bank of Fujian Also Arrives, Indistinguishable from Genuine Bills but Without Signatures</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that counterfeit Chinese banknotes are currently flowing into the city in a steady stream, causing great harm to merchants. It is reported that the amount of counterfeit currency that has been transported to Shanghai has exceeded 25,000 yuan. The police departments of the two settlements have taken notice of this and are trying to track down the source of the counterfeit five-yuan notes through all possible leads. It has now been discovered that the number of counterfeit banknotes imitating those of the Farmers Bank of China is particularly large. Another type of counterfeit currency is the five-yuan and ten-yuan notes imitating those of the Bank of China, and their number is also large. Counterfeit currency from the Bank of Fujian has also been smuggled to Shanghai. The banknotes of the Bank of Fujian are not counterfeit, but they are worthless. These banknotes were printed by the Chinese government, but they were not signed. Because few people pay attention to the signatures on banknotes, and because these banknotes are identical in form to genuine banknotes, they are more harmful than counterfeit banknotes. The reason for the appearance of Bank of Fujian banknotes here has not been concretely proven. However, it is generally known that these banknotes were printed by the Chinese government and were intended to be used as legal currency. It is believed that due to the outbreak of the war, the banknotes could not be signed. After the Japanese army invaded, these banknotes were abandoned, and then, after the Japanese army occupied the area, they were transported out and fell into the hands of unscrupulous people who tried to smuggle them into Shanghai. However, it is not yet known who these unscrupulous people are.</p>
<h3>Japanese Notification to All Foreign Shipping Companies: To Register: British and American Shippers Unanimously Oppose</h3>
<p>Shipping companies of various countries entering and leaving areas under Japanese military control have been illegally detained or inspected by the Japanese side, and there have even been incidents of passengers being arbitrarily arrested. According to reliable foreign sources, the Japanese side is now carrying out a gradual exclusion and deprivation of the shipping rights of third countries such as Britain, America, and France. The Japanese military authorities have recently notified all foreign shipping companies that all foreign ships sailing to Chongming, Yanglinkou, Changyinsha, and other locations at the mouth of the Yangtze River, as well as the Wusong River (i.e., Suzhou Creek) and the Southern Huangpu River in the inland waterways, must register with the Japanese side and obtain a license before they are allowed to sail. This action by the Japanese side is a preliminary conspiracy to deprive third countries of their shipping rights in China. Major shipping companies in Britain, America, and other countries are now united in rejecting the Japanese notification, deciding to ignore it and to prevent illegal obstruction by the Japanese side. British and American shippers have jointly petitioned their respective consulates in Shanghai to report to their respective governments for effective measures.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Requests Increased Number of Japanese Customs Officers: Ordinary Japanese Staff Have Already Been Increased: British and American Trade Affected</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent Japanese request to the Jianghai Customs to increase the number of senior Japanese customs officers and a large number of ordinary Japanese customs officers, the negotiations between the two sides have lasted for several months and have attracted considerable attention from various circles at home and abroad. This move by the Japanese side is clearly intended to expand the Japanese influence in the Jianghai Customs, thereby facilitating the dumping of Japanese goods and excluding the trade of countries such as Britain and the United States in China. It is reported that Mr. Lowford, the British Commissioner of Customs at the Jianghai Customs, has now accepted part of the Japanese request, adding fifteen ordinary Japanese customs officers. These newly added Japanese customs officers belong to the field affairs and are assigned to serve at the newly restored Five-Part Customs. As for ordinary Japanese customs officers and senior Japanese customs officers in the internal affairs department, there has been no increase.</p>
<h3>Empty Houses in Nanshi and Zhabei Are All Nailed Shut: To Prevent Guerrillas from Lurking and Conducting Activities: The Fearful Situation Is Evident</h3>
<p>Recently, guerrillas have been unusually active in the suburbs of Shanghai, and the situation is clearly tense, causing the Japanese army to be terrified. They have been transferring soldiers and setting up defensive works in their occupied areas. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Japanese soldiers, carrying nails and wooden boards, went to Nanshi and Zhabei and nailed shut all uninhabited houses. For those who lived in the homes, they drew a secret sign on the door with a pen. It is said that this move by the Japanese army is purely to prevent guerrillas from lurking, and their fearful situation is evident.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Senior Postal Workers Transferred: The Shanghai Office of the Directorate General of Posts was officially established on the first of this month. The position of Director is concurrently held by Mr. Cha Peilin, Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration. In order to adapt to the environment, it is said that a large number of senior postal workers will be transferred away from the Shanghai Bureau within days.</p>
<h3>Central South Hotel: Searched Last Night Suddenly, Lasting About an Hour Before Completion; No Terrorist Criminals Were Found</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department, to prevent the recurrence of terrorist incidents and to maintain order, has been conducting important searches for a week, and has implemented blockades such as setting up barbed wire in border areas to prevent any terrorists from infiltrating the concession. The fact that terrorist cases have decreased significantly in recent days shows that the concession authorities have made every effort in prevention and search. Moreover, fearing that the time and location of the inspection would be leaked in advance, they often proceeded with lightning speed, also to prevent criminals from fleeing upon hearing the news. At around 9:00 PM yesterday, when the night market was bustling with the Lantern Festival, the entire reserve team and search team of the Public Concession Police Department, detectives, and the White Russian team of the International Volunteer Corps, suddenly received an emergency mobilization order. They immediately gathered, boarded two red police vehicles, and sped directly to the Central South Hotel at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and North Szechuen Road (commonly known as Dongxin Bridge). At that time, the White Russian Corps was responsible for perimeter security, temporarily cutting off traffic and prohibiting the entry and exit of travelers in the hotel. All reserve teams and search team detectives also immediately divided into small teams according to their organization and began searching each room in the hotel. In addition to the luggage being inspected, of course, each person's body was thoroughly searched. Special attention was paid to the background of the travelers. The search lasted for about an hour before the teams withdrew and returned to their stations. It is reported that no objects or persons related to terrorism were found as a result.</p>

<h3>High Rice Prices Affect the People's Food Supply: Rice Reserves Are Sufficient to Meet Needs; No Panic Expected Temporarily; Market Prices Have Reached the Limit</h3>
<p>The people's food supply within the Shanghai Concession, through the joint efforts of the authorities and rice industry groups, has sufficient rice reserves, stable prices, and no food worries. However, due to the direct bulk purchases from producing areas by the Japanese puppets, rice prices in the producing areas have risen, the source of domestic rice is scarce, and market prices have risen to the limit of 14 yuan per stone. The Bean and Rice Trade Association will discuss this matter at its meeting tomorrow. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Puppets' Massive Direct Purchases: The Bean and Rice Trade Association, in order to regulate the food supply for Shanghai citizens, has been making every effort to dredge the sources, stabilize rice prices, and strictly prohibit speculation, manipulation, and hoarding. Except for the time when the war first broke out in the winter of 1937, which resulted in a rice shortage, rice prices have never exceeded the limit of 14 yuan per stone for more than a year. The rice reserves in the concession have always been above 500,000 bags, with no concern about food shortages. Since the autumn of last year, the Japanese puppets have been making massive purchases from the rice producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, transporting them north by Japanese ships from ports such as Hupu, Wuhu, and Zhapu, totaling more than 1.5 million stones.</p>
<p>Shanghai Rice Prices Rise to Limit: Due to the massive purchases by the Japanese puppets in the producing areas, inventories have been sharply reduced and prices have risen. Currently, the top-grade rice from Changshu and Wuxi has risen from 8 or 9 yuan per stone to more than 12 yuan. Rice merchants who purchase from these areas bear an additional cost of 1.5 yuan per stone (including taxes and transportation fees), bringing the cost per stone close to 14 yuan. However, the previous limit price in the Shanghai rice market was 14 yuan, so merchants have no profit to be made and have stopped selling one after another, resulting in an unprecedented reduction in the source of domestic rice. The rice price in the bean and rice market has reached the limit of 14 yuan. General hoarders refuse to sell at lower prices, and retail sales at various rice shops have even exceeded the limit price.</p>
<p>Bean and Rice Association to Meet Tomorrow</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound Society met with a leader of the bean and rice industry yesterday, who said that the recent sudden rise in rice prices in Shanghai is indeed affected by the direct purchases made by the Japanese puppets in the producing areas. It is also true that general traders and transporters are limited by cost and refuse to sell at a loss. The only fundamental solution is to ban the Japanese puppets from purchasing from the producing areas, but this is already very difficult in practice. The Bean and Rice Trade Association considers the rise in rice prices in Shanghai to be of great importance to the future of the people's food supply, so it will be discussed at the executive and supervisory committee meeting on the 6th. According to what I know, although rice prices have risen, fortunately the rice reserves in the concession are sufficient, and the overall food supply for the people will not cause panic.</p>
<p>Rice Reserves Sufficient for Three Months: According to statistics, the rice reserves in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession are approximately 650,000 bags, each bag containing 1.25 stones, totaling approximately 810,000 stones, all stored in warehouses in the Public Concession, sufficient to maintain the food supply for the people in the Shanghai Concession for three months. Therefore, although the rice transported from the producing areas to Shanghai is scarcer than before, resulting in higher prices, the overall food supply in the concession will not face a shortage panic for the time being. The Rice and Grain Joint Management Committee organized by the concession authorities will also do its best to maintain the food supply in the two concessions, and will ensure that the unfortunate events of the winter of 1937 will not be repeated.</p>
<h3>After the Greek Ship "Livorno" Was Detained: Cargo Has Already Been Unloaded; Japanese Side Claims the Ship's Nationality Is Unclear; States Release Is Possible After Verification</h3>
<p>The Greek ship "Livorno," represented by the Norwegian trading company Wah Lun Yoko, which is located at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Szechuan Road in this city, sailed from Tianjin loaded with cargo and was detained by the Japanese Navy in Yangshupu on the morning of the 2nd. After negotiations by the Greek consul, the cargo on board began to be unloaded yesterday afternoon. The Japanese side claimed that it would be released after the nationality had been verified. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Unloading of Shanghai Cargo Begins: The Greek ship "Livorno" is represented by the Norwegian trading company Wah Lun Yoko, which sails between Shanghai and Tianjin. On the morning of the 2nd, the ship arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin. After entering the port, it was preparing to berth at the Longyi Warehouse Wharf when it was suddenly detained by the Japanese Navy and forced to anchor in the heart of the river at Yangshupu Bridge. The cargo on board, including soybean oil, soybeans, and cotton yarn loaded in Tianjin and destined for Shanghai, was also not allowed to be unloaded. After the company reported the situation to the Greek Consulate in Shanghai for negotiations, the Japanese side agreed to the unloading. Starting at 4:00 PM yesterday, the company sent workers to begin unloading. It is expected that all cargo will be unloaded by 12:00 AM last night.</p>
<p>Release Possible After Nationality Verification: The Japanese Navy has been indiscriminately detaining foreign merchant ships frequently, which has caused great indignation among foreign merchants. This time, the Japanese side did not announce the reason for the detention of the "Livorno" in advance. The Greek consul immediately lodged a strong protest, demanding immediate release to avoid significant damage to the interests of Greek merchants. After inquiries from sources by the Modern News Agency reporter, a Japanese spokesperson stated at a reception for foreign reporters the night before last that although the "Livorno" flew the Greek flag, there were doubts about its true nationality, so a detailed investigation was necessary before it could be released. According to sources from the company, the ship is indeed owned by Greek merchants, and there are records in the consulate to prove this, with no deception involved. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese side has no reason to detain it without releasing it.</p>
<h3>Victory in the War of Resistance Lies in Protracted Warfare - A French Novelist's Perspective -</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that French novelist, political observer, and journalist, Mr. Chedoene, who previously traveled to South China, met with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang in Chongqing less than two months ago. He arrived in Shanghai a week ago and told reporters yesterday (the 3rd) that Generalissimo Chiang and Madame Chiang firmly believe that China can achieve final political victory in this undeclared war with Japan. According to my personal observations, I firmly believe that China can wage a very long-term war of resistance.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang gave a comprehensive account of the New Life Movement and the important work done by Chinese women in this war. Madame Chiang said that China would fight to the end and would rather die than be slaves. I was deeply impressed. Generalissimo Chiang has high hopes for this year and is convinced that China can eventually achieve political victory. The central government, which was forced to retreat inland by the Japanese military, is surprisingly well-organized. I visited Chongqing in 1932, which was still a city of ancient times. Now I have personally witnessed its transformation. Tense reconstruction work is carried out day and night. The speed with which factories, residences, and office buildings are built is almost unbelievable. Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guilin, and other important cities are connected by exquisite highways. Well-dressed police, effective traffic management, and increasing population make Chongqing's industrial organization no different from any major city in the world. The highway connecting Burma was built quickly. Since the shipment of military supplies through Vietnam was prohibited, the excellent highway from Rangoon to Yunnan Prefecture is now the most important supply route for military supplies. Mr. Chedoene hoped to travel along this highway himself, but found it impossible. However, a foreign engineer from the League of Nations told him about the actual situation of the highway, saying that the road is a huge engineering project. It can be said to be completed in the dry season, but work must continue to be done to prepare for traffic during the rainy season. The 100-kilometer highway connecting the Burmese border is not as good as other sections because it was built by the Shan people (transliteration), who are neither Chinese nor Burmese. Road construction is not something they are familiar with. Mr. Chedoene personally witnessed the first 25 trucks of military supplies arriving in Yunnan Prefecture from Rangoon along the highway. Now the road is almost exclusively used for transporting military supplies, and it is difficult for civilians to obtain permission to travel on it. Mr. Chedoene also traveled to Guangzhou. He described the desolation of the once glorious city of Guangzhou, adding that the Japanese army had made no progress in Guangzhou for four months. Only the lowest coolies remained in the city. The farthest Japanese outposts are still within 25 miles around Guangzhou. The area uses special military tickets, and neither standard Japanese yen nor Chinese currency is actually circulating. Gambling dens and opium dens are flourishing, while stores are severely affected. All stores are forced to open by the Japanese army, and some stores even have no goods because the Japanese army threatens to occupy stores whose owners do not operate. It is reported that Mr. Chedoene first came to China in 1930, and then wrote a book on the National Revolution, titled "China." In 1934, he returned to China via the United States and wrote the book "The Far East." The following year, he wrote the book "The Far West." He came to China for the third time in November last year.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Inspection Group Visits Factories: National Goods Association Hosts a Welcome Banquet</h3>
<p>After the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Ancestral Land Industrial Inspection Group, including Lin Hongxing and Xie Yutang, arrived in Shanghai, they visited the Hongzhang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in the morning of yesterday, accompanied by Xie Zhongfu, a member of the National Goods Factory Federation. In the afternoon, they visited the Great China Rubber Factory. They are scheduled to visit the Rongfeng Yarn Factory and the Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory today. Last night, Xie Zhongfu and others hosted a banquet to welcome all members of the group.</p>
<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission: Dr. Baker Went to Tianjin Yesterday to Discuss Rural Cooperation in Hebei Province</h3>
<p>Dr. Baker, secretary of the China International Famine Relief Commission and director of the Shanghai International Red Cross Society, took the Yusheng steamer to Tianjin on the 4th, and then went to Peiping to discuss rural cooperation affairs in Hebei Province. He will also discuss everything with the director of the Rural Improvement Division of the China International Famine Relief Commission. If the journey is safe, he also plans to get off in Jinan on his way back to Shanghai. This trip will take about three weeks.</p>
<h3>National Government Makes Every Effort to Collect Gold and Silver: Enriching Domestic Economic Strength; Directly Increasing Foreign Exchange Funds; Indirectly Consolidating the Credit of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>The National Government's financial authorities are working to strengthen the country's economic power, and are committed to consolidating the credit of legal tender. With all efforts, they are developing the gold and silver buried underground in the country, and absorbing the gold and silver of people in various places to directly increase foreign exchange funds, and indirectly consolidating the credit of legal tender. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Distribution of Gold and Silver Mines Throughout the Country: Among China's gold mines, Heilongjiang and Jilin are the first to be mentioned, followed by Shandong and other places. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned places have all fallen into war zones. The famous gold-producing areas in the rear areas of the War of Resistance are the Datong River Basin in Qinghai, Zhangla in Songpan, Sichuan, and the Mahao factories in Suijing and Yanyuan and Mianning. The gold-producing areas in Hunan are Pingjiang, Taoyuan, and Yuanling. In addition, there is also gold production in Xikang, Gansu, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, but the amount is not large. According to statistics from the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, based on 1934, the six provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Shandong, and Hebei produced approximately 51,000 taels of gold. The eight provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, etc. produced approximately 121,000 taels of silver.</p>
<p>Encouraging and Guiding the Exploitation of Various Mines: In order to develop inland gold and silver mines, a mining committee has been organized to actively carry out (1) prospecting for mines, (2) designing mining, (3) raising capital, (4) defining responsibilities, and allowing private individuals to freely exploit, and try to encourage them, such as (1) exempting taxes, (2) lending capital, (3) dispatching personnel to guide, (4) purchasing at favorable prices. Currently, the gold and silver mines in the southwest and northwest provinces, in addition to being designed and exploited by the competent authorities, the gold and silver mined by private individuals are all purchased by the government, and technical personnel are selected and dispatched by the Resources Committee to various places to provide guidance. The government purchases machines and lends them to private individuals for application to improve mining methods.</p>
<p>Absorbing Gold and Silver Stored by the People: After the four banks of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China set up offices for the exchange of gold and silver, they made every effort to absorb the gold and silver stored by the people and promoted them widely by governments and party headquarters at all levels: (1) Exchanging gold and silver for legal tender is loyalty to the country, directly increasing the country's economic strength, and indirectly increasing resources for the War of Resistance. (2) Exchanging gold and silver for legal tender is actually beneficial to oneself. Dead-end gold and silver not only do not generate interest, but are also easily stolen. Once exchanged, they can be invested in production businesses or deposited in banks to generate interest, and are also beneficial to society. In addition, gold and silver exchange offices are set up everywhere, and the exchange rate of gold and silver is increased to engage in purchases.</p>
<h3>50 Scout Troops Serve with the Army: Experiencing Four Provinces and Cities; Walking 4,000 Miles</h3>
<p>The service report of the 50th Scout Troop in this city, who served in the Red Cross, has been reported to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the Chinese Red Cross. The work of those who served with the army is as follows: (A) The first phase, serving in Shanghai for one month. The general outline of the work is (1) assisting the military medical department in first aid and bandaging of wounded soldiers, (2) organizing civilian stretcher teams, (3) guiding air defense common sense, etc. Twelve people served, covering areas from Hongkou to Qingpu and surrounding villages, totaling 235 kilometers. 200 stretcher teams were organized, and 800 wounded soldiers were rescued and transported. (B) The second phase, serving in the inland areas, from November 9, 1937 to the end of 1938, a total of 13 months. The general outline of the H-work is (1) withdrawing westward with the army from Shanghai, walking 3,000 kilometers, and turning to Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan provinces. Stationed in Fengxiang, Shaanxi. (2) Moving from Fengxiang to Xi'an through the snow to assist in the work. (3) During the Battle of Xuzhou, serving with the army near Xinglongji and Kaifeng on the Longhai Line, taking on the rescue of wounded soldiers. (4) After the retreat from Xuzhou, moved to villages near Luoyang to diagnose and treat the poor, provide medicine, and assist in the medical treatment of wounded soldiers and other matters. Sixteen people served.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Citizens' Federation Women and Children Education and Nursing Home: Preparatory Meeting Held Yesterday; Directors of the Board of Directors Were Elected; Founding Expenses of the Nursing Home Were Pledged</h3>

<h3>Anniversary of the Death of the Premier Approaching: All Circles Preparing for Solemn Commemoration; Flags to Be Flown at Half-Mast, Entertainment Suspended, and a Day of Vegetarianism; Tree Planting Temporarily Not Held Due to Special Circumstances</h3>
<p>The 12th of this month is the anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. All circles in this city will lower flags to half-mast, suspend entertainment, and observe a day of vegetarianism to express their condolences. This day is also Arbor Day. In the past, all circles in this city, under the leadership of the municipal authorities, would go to the suburbs to hold tree-planting ceremonies every year. Since the War of Resistance, due to special circumstances, the suburbs have been blockaded, so it is temporarily not held. However, all circles in this city believe that with the current national crisis, the War of Resistance and national construction are underway and require continued contributions to strengthen support for the government and complete arduous missions. At the same time, refugees in Shanghai are gathered, and providing food and relief requires long-term support. It has been decided to continue to promote the saving and disaster relief movement to benefit the country and comfort the spirit of the national father in heaven.</p>
<p>The National Government's Ministry of Justice: Sends Personnel to Investigate False Lawyers; Instructs Bar Association to Revoke Their Qualifications</p>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration of the National Government has sent personnel to investigate in detail the lawyers in the occupied areas who participated in the puppet organization. After investigation by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, important members of the Jiangsu Provincial Bar Association who participated in the puppet organization, such as those in Jiangning, Wuxian, Wujin, and Wuxi, will have their lawyer qualifications revoked. It is heard that 18 lawyers in the Shanghai Bar Association have also participated in the puppet organization. The Ministry has instructed the Shanghai Bar Association to remove the 18 lawyers and revoke their lawyer qualifications.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Revenue for Last Year: 20 Million Yuan; Could Have Exceeded Budget If There Were No War; More Than Three Times the Tax Revenue of the Previous Year</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax and began collecting taxes on October 1, 1936, the total revenue for 1936 (from October 1, 1936 to June 30, 1937) was 6,487,271 yuan in national currency, exceeding its budget by more than 1.5 million yuan, which is sufficient to prove that it has successfully passed its initial stage and is gradually on track. The budget for income tax revenue in 1937 (from July 1, 1937 to June 30, 1938) was 25 million yuan. At the end of the year, the summarized and reported figures reached 19,116,270 yuan, more than three times higher than the previous year. Since the War of Resistance, people have been displaced and wandering, and countless public and private properties have been destroyed by artillery fire or trapped in war zones. Traffic is blocked, freight is stagnant, and all industries are affected. As a result, the source of income tax has naturally been greatly reduced, and tax revenue must have been affected. Otherwise, the income tax revenue for 1937 would have exceeded the budgeted amount. The following is a record of the revenue statistics: Category 1, A (profit income of companies, firms, shops, factories) 4,942,077.38 yuan, B (profit income of official-private joint ventures) 68,461.04 yuan, C (income from temporary profit-making businesses) 1,299,205.83 yuan. Category 2, A (salary income of civil servants) 1,810,929.63 yuan, B (salary income of freelancers) 22,013.04 yuan, C (salary income of others engaged in various industries) 435,079.30 yuan. Category 3, A (interest income from government bonds) 6,998,901.66 yuan, B (company debt interest income) 34,479.50 yuan, C (stock interest income) 208,254.00 yuan, D (deposit interest income) 3,296,391.55 yuan, others 577.00 yuan, totaling 19,116,369.93 yuan (this number cannot be considered the final figure and needs to be revised after the annual review). After all the reports from various places are collected, the whole number will surely reach more than 20 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Jewelry Merchant's Estate Lawsuit: Awaiting Evidence for Further Verification</h3>
<p>The late Mr. Zhang Bingxin, a wealthy local jewelry and antique merchant, came from humble beginnings. He lost his father in childhood and was raised by his mother, Zhang Ou (still alive at 76 years old, residing at No. 31, Continental Lane, Rue Lutetia). Through business, he gradually became wealthy, originally living in the Shipinong area of Ximen. He had one wife and two concubines, but still without a biological heir, he adopted a son named Haoqiu, now 23 years old. Mr. Zhang's wife passed away three years ago. After the August 13th Incident, the family moved to No. 234, Route des Soeurs. Mr. Zhang Bingxin passed away from illness around October of that year, leaving behind</p>
<p>an elderly mother, concubines Zhang Qin and Zhang Dai, adopted son Zhang Haoqiu, and Haoju, a daughter born to concubine Dai, as well as real estate, jewelry, antiques, and nearly a million in cash. Since Mr. Zhang had no siblings or close relatives, his estate was</p>
<p>inventoried and sealed</p>
<p>in a trunk by his friends, real estate tycoon Huang Ruisheng, the currently disgraced and traitorous lawyer Tu Fu (also known as Tu Zhenhu), who used to be the president of the Shanghai Local Court, and Kong Chenglin. The trunk was then entrusted to Zhang's mother, Zhang Ou, for safekeeping. Around March of last year, it was alleged that Zhang's concubines Qin and Dai colluded with the adopted son Zhang Haoqiu, and while Zhang Ou was out, they moved the trunk out and stored it at Huang Ruisheng's house. When Zhang Ou returned home and discovered this, negotiations failed. Qin, Dai, and Zhang Haoqiu and his wife subsequently left Zhang Ou, abandoning her. Qin, Dai, and Haoqiu then opened the trunk, dividing the contents into three shares for Zhang Ou, Zhang Qin, and Zhang Dai each, with the remaining seven shares divided in half between Zhang Haoqiu and Haoju, the daughter born to Dai, each receiving three and a half shares. The one share allocated to Zhang Ou was sealed in a bank safe deposit box by Haoqiu and a certifying lawyer because Ou was not present and did not agree to the distribution. It is said that Zhang Ou's share is worth approximately 14,000 yuan, with only 19 yuan in cash. Consequently, Zhang Ou</p>
<p>filed a lawsuit</p>
<p>through her lawyers, Ge Zhitan and Sun Deji, with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Zhang Qin, Zhang Dai, Zhang Haoqiu, and Huang Ruisheng of colluding to steal entrusted property, abandon elders, and requested a trial according to the law, along with a civil suit requesting permission to recover the stolen trunk, expedite its disposal, and place it in custody to prevent the dispersal of assets. The defendants hired Shen Weihan, Zhao Tiezhang, Sun Qiying, and Song Yunhui as their defense lawyers. Presiding Judge Miao Qingbang</p>
<p>held two court hearings, instructing the defendants to submit the property division agreement for investigation and witness testimony. The hearings were adjourned for further proceedings, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing resumed. The plaintiff, Zhang Ou, was represented by her lawyer due to old age and illness. The defendants, Zhang Qin, Zhang Dai, and Zhang Haoqiu, each appeared with their defense lawyers. Huang Ruisheng was represented by lawyer Song Yunhui, who stated that he represented Huang's family and that Huang Ruisheng had</p>
<p>passed away from illness</p>
<p>on the first of this month. He submitted the obituary notice and the receipts for the trunk taken by the first, second, and third defendants, requesting the court to rule Huang Ruisheng's case as inadmissible or to persuade the plaintiff to withdraw the charges against Huang Ruisheng. Plaintiff's lawyer Ge Zhitan stated that the plaintiff's case included a civil suit, and although the defendant Huang Ruisheng had died, his civil liabilities should still be borne. The judge stated that the court was currently hearing the criminal part of the case, and the civil part</p>
<p>had not yet been heard.</p>
<p>The lawyer Song then withdrew. The judge also instructed the defendants to submit a written request to summon witnesses, but due to lack of time today, witnesses were not summoned, and the hearing was adjourned again. Plaintiff's lawyer Ge Zhitan also stated that the court had previously ordered the defendants to submit the property division agreement, and asked if the defendants had brought it today. He requested the court to order the defendants to submit it within three days so that his lawyer could review it during file examination. The defendants' lawyer stated that they had not brought it today and would submit it after photocopying. Regarding the assets allocated to the plaintiff and sealed in the Salt Industry Bank safe deposit box, he requested the court to send a letter to the bank to submit the sealed items. The court then adjourned the hearing to the 14th to summon witnesses for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Puppet Infighting: Coveting the Fake "Unified Tax Bureau," Shao Shijun Feels Uneasy</h3>
<p>According to sources, the fake "General Taxation Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces" in Shanghai was originally established by Shao Shijun under the instructions of the Japanese, under the control of Nammoto, the head of the Japanese special agency in Shanghai. It can collect 4-5 million yuan in fake "taxes" each month, and while nominally a tax authority for the fake three provinces, the fake "Reformed Government's Ministry of Finance" cannot manage it. The fake "Bureau"</p>
<p>only remits</p>
<p>100,000 yuan per month to the fake "Reformed Government," which must be split with the fake Shanghai "Municipal Government," so the fake "Reformed Government" actually only gets 70-80,000 yuan per month. The fake "Bureau" has also recently started issuing a fake stamp tax and promoting it in a few points reached by the Japanese army in the three provinces. The fake "Reformed Ministry of Finance" also</p>
<p>seeks a share</p>
<p>of the profits. The fake Minister of Finance, Chen Jintao, and the fake Vice Minister, Ji Jingchen, both feel they exist in name only, with no profit to be made. Therefore, after repeated consultations with Liang Hongzhi and others, taking advantage of the replacement of Nammoto, the head of the Shanghai special agency, by Major General Takeshita, they argued that from January onwards, all fake "miscellaneous taxes" had been abolished, and the source of funding for various fake "provinces, cities, and counties" had been cut off,</p>
<p>making it impossible to maintain operations.</p>
<p>They requested Major General Takeshita to allow the fake "tax revenue" of the three provinces to be transferred from the Japanese to the fake "Reformed Government's" control. It is said that the new head of the special agency has agreed to this principle. Although the fake "tax revenue" has not been entirely transferred to the fake "Reformed Government," after discussions, at least the fake "Reformed Government" can</p>
<p>share half</p>
<p>of the profits each month. Since the fake "Tax Bureau" was established, Shao Shijun and others, including the fake "Secretary-General" and the seven fake "Section Chiefs" have all been engaging in self-enrichment and corruption, accumulating vast wealth. The Japanese have heard about this and have decided to reorganize the fake agency in the near future, nominally transferring it to the control of the fake "Ministry of Finance," with separate detailed rules for revenue sharing. Shao Shijun's</p>
<p>one year as a puppet</p>
<p>will be forced to end. There are many people vying for this lucrative position. It is also rumored that Wu Wenzhong, the current fake "Director of the Municipal Government's Judicial Department" and fake "Director of the Social Affairs Bureau," is also scheming to become the second puppet "Director."</p>
<h3>Xinzha Police Go to French Concession to Arrest Robbers: 16 Men and Women Arrested, Two Pistols Confiscated</h3>

After the judgment, Li Zhishan, the police lawyer, stated that he needed to consider whether to appeal the acquittal of Chen Longkang and the other two defendants, requesting permission to remand them in custody during the appeal period. The court approved the request.</p>
<p>Resisting Arrest: Bandit Handed Over to Court for Trial</p>
<p>Yang Chengcai, Chinese detective chief of the Old Zha Police Station, previously received a report from an informant that a gang of robbers was hiding in Room 223 of the Old Eastern Hotel on Zhejiang Road. He secretly went there on the afternoon of the 15th of last month and arrested a robber named Li Jianming (aka Ye Amao). Unexpectedly, while interrogating him, Li seized an opportunity to take out a pistol from his coat pocket and fire, injuring detective chief Yang in the arm. Two other detectives, Cao Qishan and Huang Sifu, were also injured in the hand by the bullets, and Li escaped in the chaos. Afterwards, Chinese detective chiefs Huang Siming and Yang Fusheng of the Xinzha Police Station learned that Li was hiding in a house at No. 219 Yunnan Road. They went there at 10:30 pm on the 23rd of last month and arrested Cao Jianming, confiscating bank checks, savings books, 863 yuan in cash, 16 pieces of clothing, two watches, one necklace, and several pieces of gold jewelry. They brought him to the police station and subsequently arrested three accomplices, Chen Baosheng, Huang Xingyang, and Sang Rongxiang. They were handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. The detectives in charge of the case found that Li was related to the robbery of 32,000 yuan from the Yitaixing Coal Store at No. 184 Xinzha Road at 11:15 pm on January 15th of this year. This morning, the police escorted the four suspects, Li, etc., to the Special Court. The defendants hired Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, Huang Xiubo, Zhou Xiaoan, etc., as their lawyers to defend them. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the case still needed investigation and requested a postponement. The judge approved the request and adjourned the hearing for seven days. However, it is said that the injured detective chief Yang Chengcai's injuries were difficult to heal and he had already been discharged from the hospital, but suddenly died in custody last night.</p>
<p>Three Robbers' Crimes Investigated</p>
<p>Chinese and Western detectives of the Chengdu Road Police Station previously arrested three robbers, Li Jiaguang, Zhao Guangfu, and Shen Dianwu, and handed them over to the First Special Court for interrogation. It was found that Li and others had robbed Sun Tangquan and others of 660 yuan at No. 8, Lane 290, Datong Road on October 5th of last year, robbed Mao Shiliang's family of 310 yuan at No. 30, Lane 587, Xiaoshadu Road on October 27th of last year, robbed Huang Haoyuan's family of 350 yuan at No. 260 Wuding Road on October 28th of last year, robbed Wu Jingming's family of 325 yuan at No. 27, Lane 727, Tiantong Road on November 20th of last year, and robbed Ni Shuji's family of 646 yuan at No. 7, Lane 988, North Chengdu Road on December 6th of last year. This morning, they were handed over to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above situation. The judge questioned the defendants and the victims and ordered them to be detained pending further verification.</p>
<p>Apprentice Captures Thief to Death: Won't Let Go</p>
<p>Xia Zhengxiang, the owner of the Zhengji Rice Shop in the French Concession, previously went to the rice industry tea party at the Qingliange Teahouse on Fuzhou Road with his apprentice Xu Dekang to collect payments. At that time, they collected 503 yuan. Xia, because he still had matters to attend to at Qingliange, ordered Xu Dekang to take the money to other places to collect payments and then return to the store alone. When Xu was walking at the intersection of Niuzhuang Road and Zhejiang Road, several robbers suddenly came forward and robbed the money Xu was carrying. At that time, Xu bravely grabbed a thief, Huang Mufa (also known as Huang Bingkang), a resident of Puxi, and refused to let go. The remaining robbers then beat Xu with iron bars, but Xu refused to release the robber until his death. At that time, Chinese detective Wang Jiaju, detective Huang Sifu, and a patrolman from No. 199 Chinese Third Patrol passed by, and the remaining robbers fled. The robber Huang was arrested by the detectives and taken to the Old Zha Police Station. However, the stolen money had been taken away by his accomplices. Yesterday, the robber Huang was handed over to the First Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the accomplices and the original stolen goods still needed to be investigated, so he requested permission for a postponement. After questioning by Judge Feng, the court ordered him to be remanded in custody and the hearing adjourned for further proceedings.</p>
<p>Xiaoshadu Road: Arrest of Notorious Robbers</p>
<p>Feng Zhiming, Chinese detective chief of the Public Concession Police Headquarters, and detectives Yang Ciguang and Zhou Honglin learned that several robbers were hiding in a bungalow at No. 290, Lane, Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai, plotting wrongdoing. They rushed to arrest them at 9:20 pm the night before. At that time, there were two robbers in the house. When they saw the detectives arrive, one of the robbers, Shan Zhongzhi from Shandong, pulled out a large-caliber pistol from his pocket, intending to resist arrest. Fortunately, the detectives were quick and agile, grabbed Shan, and seized the pistol, which contained six bullets. Another robber, Liu Baotian, also from Shandong, was also arrested by the detectives and taken back to the police station. Yesterday, they were handed over to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the process, that the defendants had committed many crimes and were currently under detailed investigation, so he requested permission for a one-week postponement pending investigation and further prosecution. After interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, the court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and the hearing adjourned for further proceedings.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Theft Cases</h3>
<p>A residence with the surname "Mou" at No. 68, Lane 545, Hart Road, was robbed by four robbers at around 7:30 pm yesterday during dinner. Three of the robbers were armed. After entering the house, they immediately displayed their guns to intimidate everyone and forced them not to make any noise. They were driven to the corner of the room and guarded. The robbers then divided up and searched each room, resulting in the theft of clothing, jewelry, and cash worth approximately 330 yuan before fleeing. The victim reported the incident to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>The residence of the Yang family at No. 31, Hengchang Lane, Bayle Road, French Concession, was invaded by five robbers at around 3 pm yesterday. Three of them were armed with pistols and threatened the men and women in the house, searching at will. As a result, they robbed more than 200 yuan in French currency and fled with the stolen goods. The victim reported the situation to the Lokawei Police Station, requesting that the robbers be arrested and brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Selling Abortifacient Pills and Pastes: Shop Owner Flees in Fear of Punishment; Court Issues Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>Wanquantang Pharmacy at No. 215 Guangxi Road was investigated by Chinese detective chief Chen Yonggui and detective Huang Sifu of the Old Zha Police Station for selling abortifacient drugs such as musk, uterine pills, and pastes. They posed as customers and purchased the above pills and pastes, which were tested by the Industrial Bureau's testing department and found to be not only unable to induce abortion, but also harmful to women's health. They filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court according to law. The pharmacy owner, Zhang Wannian from Hebei, failed to appear in court when summoned, so the court ordered a postponement and issued another summons. Yesterday, Judge Chui Qing of the Special Court continued the hearing. Zhang still failed to appear. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that it had been discovered that Zhang had fled, so he requested the issuance of an arrest warrant. The court reviewed the report and ordered the case to be postponed and Zhang Wannian to be arrested and brought to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Lin Biao Joins Enemy: Appointed Head of Regulations Compilation for Fake Organization</h3>
<p>The fake "Reformed Government" in Nanjing hired several judicial personnel and lawyers to organize a fake "Regulations Compilation Committee," headed by Lin Biao, a Guangdong native and former president of the Jiangsu High Court who is currently practicing law in Shanghai. After being "hired," Lin has entrusted his law firm in Shanghai to another lawyer for management and has gone to Nanjing to take up his "post."</p>
<h3>Suzhou Woman Li Xu Sues for Living Expenses: Awaiting Witness Yu Zuoting to Appear in Court for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>Li Xu, a 39-year-old woman from Suzhou, hired lawyer Kong Zhaozhang to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Li Zuhuai (resident of No. 107 Avenue Joffre) and Li Zumai and Li Zukai, whose legal representative is Li Yao (resident of No. 19 Route des Soeurs), etc., for living expenses. The hearing was held yesterday morning. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff married Li Beiping (from Zhenhai, Ningbo) as a concubine in 1918. His first wife gave birth to the first defendant. After the first wife passed away, Beiping married Li Yao as a concubine, who gave birth to the second and third defendants. In 1934, Beiping passed away, leaving behind assets, including real estate and movable property worth over 610,100 yuan, which were all managed by Yao. She paid the plaintiff 250 yuan per month for living expenses. On June 6, 1937, the defendants divided the property, and it was decided by relatives and friends to allocate 10,000 yuan to the plaintiff, plus an annual payment of 2,200 yuan until the end of her life. Unexpectedly, at the end of 1938, the annual payment was stopped. He requested that the defendants be ordered to pay the full amount. The second and third defendants, represented by lawyer Wang Boxian, argued that the annual payment to the plaintiff was to be paid from the income of the ancestral property. However, the ancestral property in the South City had been severely affected by the war and was almost completely destroyed, making it impossible to pay. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that the plaintiff had recently received a letter from the first defendant stating that the payment should be jointly borne by the second and third defendants. Now the defendants were deliberately shirking responsibility and should be called as witnesses for cross-examination. The court reviewed the case and adjourned the hearing to the 18th to summon witness Yu Zuoting to appear in court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Woman Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>

<h3>Qinxing Factory in Hongkou Forcibly Occupied and Started Work</h3>
<p>The Qinxing Socks and Shirt Factory at No. 33, Lane 130, Yalv Road, Hongkou, left behind various machines, cattle, wealth, furniture and other items after the August 13th Incident without being moved. After the war, due to traffic congestion, they were unable to return to the factory to start work. In the ninth lunar month, the so-called Kangtai Velvet Factory requested cooperation. If cooperation was not agreed to, it was also necessary to lease the factory for use. The Qinxing Socks and Shirt Factory immediately declined politely. On October 25th, the Kangtai Factory sent another letter to Qinxing, stating that they had obtained permission from the Japanese military to use the factory and start work. Recently, they have connected water and electricity and recruited male and female workers under the name of the Kangtai Branch Factory to start weaving. The Qinxing Factory has reported this situation to the Public Concession Industry Bureau for filing.</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Opium Trafficking Organization to be Established in West Shanghai, Organized by Guo Bosheng and Others</h3>
<p>Since a certain party has been buying opium dealers, filling the market with opium, and implementing a policy of poisoning the Chinese people, not only in the occupied areas but also in the suburbs of Shanghai, the poisonous fog is pervasive and increasing day by day. It has attracted great attention from Chinese and foreigners. At the same time, narcotics and other substances have repeatedly entered the concession area, and the police authorities have strictly ordered their arrest, and the narcotics have been slightly restrained. It is learned that Guo Bosheng, the owner of Guo Yuanmao Earth Bank, is a well-known opium dealer and has accumulated a great fortune. He still does not think about reforming and wants to profit from drugs. He is willing to collude with a certain party, and at the same time, he and Gu and Zheng Cheng Chen Hongsheng and others plan to organize a large-scale drug trafficking organization. They have secretly discussed it in a certain restaurant. After repeated discussions, they have obtained the consent of a certain party to first organize a large-scale opium trafficking company in West Shanghai. The capital is to be provided by Guo and others, and the transportation will be handled by a certain party's special agents. It will be officially established soon. It is reported that this large organization will be divided into several small organizations, secretly deployed in West Shanghai, so as to monopolize the drug market. According to their calculations, after implementation, they can make huge profits every month, and half of the profits will be used as a tribute to a certain party.</p>
<h3>Fake "Water Police" Cooperate with Bandits Secretly Forming Fences Stealing Cotton Yarn and Coal from Various Foreign Mills The incident is exposed and the fake police are all implicated</h3>
<p>The fake "water police team", an affiliate of the fake "police bureau", has recently been discovered by the Japanese to be harboring bandits, opening a fence. As a result, the fake "water police team" has been detained. Huo Liangchen, the fake "team leader", has been hiding for three days and has not yet shown up. Details have been obtained and are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Black and White Fences Specialize in Stealing Cotton Yarn and Coal After the fall of Shanghai, some bandits in the Pudong River took advantage of the changing environment and colluded with fake officials to organize the so-called "White Tiger" fence and the "Black Gold" fence. The former, called "White Tiger", is the slang term for cotton yarn, and the latter, called "Black Gold", is the slang term for coal. These bandits used the evening to steal cotton yarn and various smoked white coal from the foreign wharves along the river. The organization was large-scale and the fence was mobile. When the situation tightened, they would move. Although the water and land agencies ordered arrests and successively arrested bandits, these black and white fences did not stop.</p>
<p>Foreign Wharf Fake Police Cooperate with Bandits The fake "water police team" has a fake "outpost" in Yangjing Port, Pudong, with a fake "sergeant" and more than 20 fake "police officers". Their apparent task is to arrest water theft cases, but these fake "police officers" took the opportunity to collude with the bandits in the Pudong River and also opened a so-called "Black Gold Fence" (ie, stolen coal) in Yangjing Port, as many as six. On the surface, they hang up a coal shop sign. Every night, bandits are sent to operate in the Pudong River. Because no one arrests them, they can get a huge amount of coal every night, and then try to sell it on the market. The profits are self-evident. Therefore, the fake "water police officers" are all wealthy.</p>
<p>Case is Exposed: Fake Police Arrested and Tortured Three days ago, the Japanese special agency in Pudong suddenly arrested nine male and female coal thieves and boatmen in Shibataken and brought them back for interrogation. They confessed to the coal theft fences in Yangjing Port and revealed the inside story and background, implicating all the fake "police officers" of the fake "police station" of the fake "water police team". They also pointed out that Gu Jinsheng, the fake "town chief" of Yangjing, was also a key figure. They immediately secretly reported to the Japanese military police and arrested all 20 fake "police officers" of the fake "sergeant" of the station and detained them. They were severely tortured. The fake "town chief" has not yet been arrested due to his background, and the six coal theft fences they set up have all been sealed, totaling more than 300 tons of stolen coal.</p>
<p>Fake Team Leader Has Been Hiding for Three Days Qiao Ben, the chief of the Japanese special agency in Pudong, believes that Huo Liangchen, the fake "water police team leader", is also suspected of colluding and sharing the spoils after the case was solved. Huo heard the news and ran away. It is rumored that Huo went to Jiangwan to cry to Lu Ying, the fake "police bureau chief", and asked Lu to help him find a way to exonerate him. Another said that Huo hid in the isolated island. Outsiders still cannot know where he is hiding. However, according to the reporter, Huo has not been to the fake "team" for three consecutive days and has disappeared. The special agency is repeatedly asking for people and urging them urgently. It is still difficult to know what the result will be.</p>

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>Jingqi: According to what my client Xu Wengui has stated to the firm, after reading the Shanghai Youth Association Travel Dispute Truth in your newspaper's local news on February 28th, it is greatly inconsistent with the facts and deeply surprising. Recently, the Youth Association unreasonably increased the rent, and the tenants opposed it. The clerk also did not think what they did was right, and repeatedly advised the association's deputy director Yang Yihui, etc., to focus on serving the community and dispel the original proposal. Unexpectedly, Yang, etc., not only did not adopt it, but held a grudge in their hearts, thinking that Wengui had very few relatives and friends in Shanghai, and it was easy to bully him. As a result, at about 7 pm on the 25th, the association instigated many tea servants to join in a group beating. At that time, a Westerner witnessed it on the spot. Indignant, he signed and was willing to be a witness. All the actual circumstances have been detailed in your newspaper the next day (26th). I am stealing Wengui since childhood is a young member, check the names of guarantors filled in accordance with the regulations at the time of stay (in fact, there is a place where notoriously notorious guests can live without a guarantor,) and pay a deposit. All the sections reported in your newspaper on the 28th are assumed to be inaccurate hearsay. Among them, giving a small amount of money and asking him to find another inn to stay in is even less true. It is obviously the association's fabrication of rumors and deliberate slander. The above is a request to send a letter of correction. I have always admired your newspaper for its fairness and impartiality, so I hereby convey the situation on behalf of the party, hoping that the letter will be published in the letter column to replace the correction and show the facts. Sincerely yours, Shenbao Local News Editorial Department, Lawyer Dai Ji'en, March 4, 28th year of the Republic of China,</p>

<h3>Finance: Re-raising the Purchase and Exchange Method Incites an Extraordinary Gold Surge: Northern Banks and Foreign Banks Spare No Expense to Compete for Purchases, Creating an Unprecedented Peak of 2,200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold dark market situation saw an astonishing surge, with one surge following another. It even broke through the previous high record of 2,171 yuan on the 27th of last month, suddenly showing an unprecedented new peak of 2,200 yuan. This was due to the report on the day that the Ministry of Finance was willing to purchase it at a considerable value, and the rise in gold prices in Tianjin was heard to reach 2,235 yuan (some say 2,300 yuan). The northern speculators in this city were stirred up by the news and started activities one after another, advancing more fiercely than before. Some foreign banks searched for purchases from behind. Therefore, although the silver building gang had a supply for sale at the time, the price hike was quite large, so the upward trend was quite sharp for a while. Eventually, with a limit price of 2,300 yuan, sellers flocked, and it was heard that the gold price in Tianjin also slightly fell back at that time. Therefore, northern speculators came to sell back. In addition, gold shops and money exchange businesses all took advantage of the high prices to sell off large quantities on behalf of wealthy people, which led to a reactive decline. In the end, it surged by 41 yuan. The rise and fall on the day were extremely sudden, and the difference between the high and low prices reached 42 yuan. Transactions were extremely active. Silver building jewelry also fluctuated, generally rising first and then falling, and then rising again. It changed five times in one day. In the end, it also squeezed up by 4 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold, etc., rose slightly.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Dark Market Horizontal Jump of a Huge 41 Yuan</p>
<p>From the early morning (each bar is ten taels), the initial buyers surged, and the price was raised from 2,150 yuan to 60 yuan. It was only then that trading began. It was first seen that a money exchange business entered 100 taels in total in the silver building gang, with 2,158 yuan being the opening price, which was 9 yuan higher than the trading price on the previous day. After the opening, due to the news that the gold price in Tianjin was high and the foreign exchange rate was soft, there was even more of a shortage of sellers, and those who entered were even more anxious, so the price continued to rise sharply. A money exchange business fork entered 100 taels in the silver building gang, and the price jumped to 70 yuan. (It is heard that the above entries were mostly absorbed on behalf of foreign banks.) The securities gang opportunistically entered 50 taels in the silver building gang, and the price was 80 yuan. Later, a money exchange business came to absorb purchases again. At that time, sellers were even scarcer, so the upward trend intensified. A money exchange business entered 50 taels in the silver building gang, and the price was 95 yuan. It was entered another 50 taels in the silver building gang, 200 yuan was the highest peak ever. After that, although a broker (also on behalf of northern speculators) forcefully entered, but at that time, with a limit price of 2,200 yuan, sellers surged strongly, and there were quite a few people who took profits and came out, so they reacted and went down. The money exchange business sold 50 taels to a broker at a price of 88 yuan. The silver building gang sold 50 taels to a broker at a price of 83 yuan. Later, the money exchange business sold another 50 taels to a broker, with a price of 78 yuan. At that time, the securities gang came to absorb purchases fiercely again, so the price rose upward again. The money exchange business entered 50 taels in the gold shop, and the price was 90 yuan. The securities gang entered 50 taels in the gold shop, and the price was 92 yuan. After that, a silver building suddenly came to sell, so the price dropped again. A silver building sold 50 taels to a securities gang, 85 yuan, and sold another 50 taels to a securities gang for 80 yuan. Later, a broker entered 50 taels in the money exchange business, with a price of 88 yuan. Near noon, the money exchange business traded 50 taels among themselves, with 78 yuan being the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the securities gang first entered 50 taels in the money exchange business, with a price of 2,185 yuan. Later, another 100 taels were entered in a money exchange business for 83 yuan. Later, the money exchange business traded 50 taels among themselves at a price of 76 yuan. After that, the money exchange business entered 50 taels in the silver building gang at a price of 80 yuan. Then, the money exchange business traded 50 taels among themselves for 85 yuan. Finally, the money exchange business entered 50 taels in the gold shop, with 2,190 yuan being the late closing price, which was a squeeze of 41 yuan higher than the previous day. It has risen rapidly for two days, totaling 61 yuan. The current gold shop's own brand gold selling price is 2,200 yuan, and the purchase price is 2,185 yuan. The current standard gold auction price is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there is no open trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Moved Five Times, Finally Also Increased by Four Yuan</p>
<p>The initial price of jewelry gold per tael for exchange in silver buildings has not changed. Until 8:50, due to the intensified surge in gold bullion, it also rose by 2 yuan. Five minutes later, due to the unprecedented peak of gold bullion reaching 2,200 yuan, it also jumped by 4 yuan, producing the highest record since the establishment of the Datong Hang at 224 yuan and the Xintong Hang at 222 yuan. Not long after, at exactly 10 o'clock, because gold bullion turned down, it also hung a small 2 yuan, and at 12:02 it returned a small 1 yuan. Finally, at 4:20, it rose again by 1 yuan. Datong Hang Laoqingyun and others changed to hang at 222 yuan, and Xintong Hang hung at 220 yuan, purchasing at 214 yuan.</p>
<p>London Pure Gold Telegram Yesterday: Sudden Return Half Penny Higher</p>
<p>The London telegram on the 3rd reported that the price of British pure gold per ounce cried back half a penny, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, and four pence, causing the China cash purchase price of the Central Bank to also return to a high of 1,210 yuan and 9 jiao.

<h3>Exchange Market Slightly Fluctuates; Settlement Still Keen, British Pound and US Dollar Tight; British-American Exchange Rate Drops for Two Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange market saw the British-American exchange rate decline for two consecutive days, causing HSBC to initially announce tight British Pound and US Dollar positions. Subsequently, foreign banks and favorable agents vigorously purchased current British Pound and US Dollar exchange rates for Tianjin and other foreign-owned banks in Pingjin. Major foreign firms, such as Asiatic Petroleum Company and Japanese factories, also followed suit in settlement purchases, leading to a tightening trend. The British Pound once retreated to 8 pence 1.09375, and the US Dollar also softened to 15.8125 yuan. However, due to the support of foreign banks like HSBC, the outcome continued to be tight for the British Pound and US Dollar. Although Hong Kong Dollar was purchased by Chinese speculators, the supply from foreign and Chinese banks remained strong, so the situation remained stable.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London cable showed no change in the spot rate, while the forward rate increased by 0.0625. The New York silver price also remained unchanged. London raw gold rose by half a penny. The exchange rate of British Pound to US Dollar was down by a small amount of 0.3 cents, to French Franc was down by 3 centimes, and unchanged to Shanghai. The US Dollar to British Pound remained the same, to French Franc was down by 0.0625, and to Shanghai was down by 5 cents. The central government's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening selling prices of banks in the morning were 8 pence 1.125 for the British Pound and 15.84375 yuan for the US Dollar, a 0.03125 tightening for both British Pound and US Dollar compared to the previous closing. Although foreign banks came to vigorously purchase after opening, the sale of Hong Kong telegraphic transfers was also strong, so the situation remained stable. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were sold to advantageous Dutch British Pounds at 8 pence 1.125, and also sold to advantageous Dutch US Dollars at 15.875 yuan. The HSBC's posted exchange rates and the unveiling of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Afterwards, oil companies like Asiatic Petroleum Company and other major foreign firms and Japanese factories came to purchase, leading to a tightening trend. Asiatic Petroleum Company settled purchases of British Pounds from Mercantile Bank at 8 pence 1.125 and 8 pence 1.09375. Subsequently, Japanese factories also purchased US Dollars from Banque Belge pour l'Etranger (Chinese) only at 15.8125 yuan. Later, advantageous companies came to purchase HSBC British Pounds (April) at 8 pence 0.0625, and then settled purchases of Banque Belge pour l'Etranger (Chinese) US Dollars (April) at 15.6875 yuan. Near noon, Chinese speculators also purchased Hong Kong Dollars from foreign banks, such as N.V. Nederlandsch-Indische Escompto Maatschappij, and Chinese banks like Guangdong at 54.375 yuan, and the situation was quite stable. At the noon closing, HSBC's selling prices were 8 pence 1.125 for the British Pound and 15.84375 yuan for the US Dollar, unchanged from the morning opening, a 0.03125 tightening for both British Pound and US Dollar compared to the previous closing. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Pounds Rise with Gold; US Bills Fall Instead</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate remained unchanged. Foreign exchange companies were settling payments very keenly, and banks' supply was not smooth. Although Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were sometimes sold, the demand was very strong, and the trend was weak. Shajah opened high and rose immediately, Tianjin merchants absorbed it very strongly, and there was a great lack of chips, which caused the market price to rise sharply and break the record again. The whole day's transaction was very prosperous, and the momentum was very firm. Foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds could not be an exception, and they followed the gold market to rise. The rich kept searching endlessly, and they were quite troubled by the inability to supply. The demand for US Dollar bills was very strong, but the supply was also strong, and there were bills of exchange involved, so they fell instead. Other currencies were mostly stable and unchanged due to the stable relationship of bills of exchange. The whole day's transaction was still prosperous, and the transactions of the association were very rare. Only Sen Tai sold 50 British gold pounds, which were collected by Hongchang on behalf of the wealthy. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold pound up by 6 jiao, American gold pound up by 3 jiao, American Dollar bill down by 3 li, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Money Market Resumes Afternoon Session</h3>
<p>The money market of the Money Trade Association in this city originally had three sessions: the morning session, the afternoon session, and the general association session. Since the August 13th battle, the market has been sluggish, and the transaction of discounting bills has greatly decreased, so the afternoon session and the general association session were cancelled, and there was only the morning session every day. Now, the association has decided to resume the afternoon session, which will be implemented from March 6th, because the market is booming, and the transactions of remittance and discounting are very frequent.</p>
<h3>British Indian Silver Price Close to Spot and Forward</h3>
<p>London, 3rd: There were a few purchases in India, and at the same time, there were a few short coverings. The market was stable. After the closing, the spot remained stable, and the forward was slightly sluggish. The spot price of the cable silver remained unchanged, and the forward increased by 0.0625. New York silver cable: The US silver price remained stable as usual. Also, Bombay silver cable: The Indian silver market was calm, the spot price remained unchanged, and both the near and far months increased by one anna.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rises to 42 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate of remittance bills continued to rise. It once rose to 42 yuan per thousand yuan in the morning, but slightly returned to 41.5 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it suddenly rose again, once reaching 42.5 yuan, and the final price was 42 yuan, 1.5 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Remain Tight; Soybean Prices Continue to Rise and Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rising trend of soybeans was even more rampant. Since the Dalian market only rose and did not fall, people's hearts were excited by it. Speculators raised prices both openly and secretly, creating the latest record since the beginning of the 28th year. Yesterday, the prices of all beans rose significantly compared to the previous day. The highest price of Chongming sand yellow had reached 8.25 yuan, and the lowest price was also 8.15 yuan, with 600-700 bags transacted. Two carriages of Bengbu beans were settled at a price of 7.76 yuan. A total of 4-5 carriages of Dalian spot beans were opened at prices of 8.25 yuan and 8.26 yuan. There were 15 carriages for delivery in April, with transaction prices ranging from 8.20 yuan to 8.25 yuan. It was found that 370 bags of soybeans were exported to Shantou, another 1,590 bags were exported to Hong Kong, and 3,500 bags of bran were also transported to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Securities: Demand for Public Bonds is Increasingly Strong; Market Prices are Expected to Rise Universally; Full-Day Trading Resumes on Monday</h3>
<p>The securities gray market rebounded gradually yesterday. The sale of spot goods by Yuanda Trading Company became increasingly rare. Only about 100,000-200,000 yuan of Class D were sold, and there were no other transactions. The demand on the counter was increasingly strong. In the past, Yuanda's adjustment had benefited greatly. Yesterday, because the company had given up, large customers' demand had to wait and see for the time being. The environmental situation improved and became clearer. The amount of British loans to China increased even further. The rumor of the opening of the exchange was very prevalent in the market. Some said that it could resume operations within two months. How it will be in reality is still subject to verification. The hearts of people who have been quiet for a long time are gradually excited. There is no doubt that the prospects for the war are becoming more and more favorable. The view that public bonds are expected to rise has become a universal sentiment. The situation yesterday was that Yuanda still had sales at the beginning, and many parties were temporarily watching due to not knowing its actual strength. At the same time, the Banque Industrielle de Chine and retail investors had some appetite, and market prices were slightly weak. Later, Yuanda only sold tens of thousands of Class D shares, and No. 35 began to purchase, in large quantities. Only No. 7 had a slight evening sale in the market, and because the demand exceeded the supply, the market rebounded and strengthened. At the close, Tiansheng Trading Company offered a small amount, and Tongkang Trading Company purchased. Although retail investors' demand was strong, it was a pity that there were no goods to be obtained. The result was a unanimous rebound, slightly rising by 1 jiao to 3.5 jiao, and the trend was extremely stable. The total turnover was estimated to be more than 600,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below. Full-day trading will resume from next week.</p>
<p>A small number of shares of China General Edison Company were traded at a price of 5.25 yuan.</p>
<p>London British Far East Companies' stock market prices on the 3rd of this month (Friday): HSBC shares fell by 1 pound and 10 shillings after rising for two consecutive days. The market price was 87 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>Grain: A Batch of Flour Futures is Traded; Newly Arrived Australian Flour Market Price Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was still no special development in the spot flour transaction. On this street, the intake was still active after the factory price was reduced by 5 cents. However, the factory lacked spot supply for the wholesale purchase of this street, except for the period flour to be delivered to customers. Therefore, the market price was firm instead. As for the period flour transaction for customers, a batch was transacted yesterday, amounting to 50,000 bags. The price of No. 2 flour was 4.7 yuan, and the prices of No. 3 and No. 4 flour remained at the original price. Several batches of newly arrived Australian foreign flour were opened on this street. Due to the influence of the environment, the prices have fallen. For example, Australian flour of the Flower Bird brand and the Bell Tower brand only sold for 4.66 yuan per bag (cash), which was about 3 jiao lower than the highest price.</p>
<p>1,000 bags of flour were shipped to Shantou today.</p>
<h3>Lack of Arrivals and Stock; Wheat Market Stagnates Informally</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was still deserted. The market transaction has stagnated informally. This is because there is a lack of arrivals and stock at present. The suppliers' minds are very firm, but foreign flour and foreign wheat arrive one after another, and the environment is very bad. Therefore, both buyers and sellers are reluctant to be involved. From morning to night, there was no transaction of a single bag. It was heard that several hundred bags of goods were sent to the factory at a similar price. The formal market has stagnated informally, and let's see how the situation will be at the beginning of next week.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Purchase Ke Xian for Transshipment to Coastal Provinces; Wuyuan Rises Another 3 Jiao</h3>
<p>Ke Xian was inquired about by transshipment merchants yesterday, and the retail sales on this street were still active. Moreover, Japanese merchants purchased it for transshipment to coastal provinces. The market continued to expand with people's hearts. The price of bulk goods rose by another 1.5 jiao or so. The prices of the best Wu Gao Xian Chongbu Yangjian were opened to 12 yuan and 11.95 yuan. More than 4,000 bags were transacted in the unified market. The Wuhu machine yuan was brought along by the "yin" yuan of the river, and it rose another 3 jiao yesterday, with the price reaching 16.5 yuan. There is little stock of foreign rice, and the arrivals have stopped. The owners are holding out for higher prices. Yesterday, the price of Saigon No. 1, which had been opened at more than 200 bags, was 3-4 jiao per bag, and the price opened at 15.5-15.6 jiao, while the owners of the special high-grade old Saigon rice were still hoarding and trying to pull up the price.</p>
<h3>Paper Money Yuan's Rising Momentum Intensifies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, among the sources from all parties, only the No. 4 from the river arrived, transporting more than 3,000 bags of dumplings. Because of the continuous rise in the market, the price of high-quality goods has been close to 14 yuan. The appetites of hoarders and this street have become slack, but the sellers' minds are still high, and the market is still showing a good trend. However, the rising momentum is not as strong as the previous market. The prices of thick and thin japonica high-quality special goods have only increased by a few cents, the price of mid-range goods has increased by 1 jiao, and Duyangjian and Bujian have not increased or decreased much. The rising trend of paper money yuan is still sharp, rising another 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Australian Wheat Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The British ship TreWellard, which transported 7,353 tons of foreign wheat from Australia, arrived at the port at 7:00 yesterday morning. The wheat was handled by Daofu Foreign Firm. The German ship JantzeFriTzen, which also loaded 8,893 tons of wheat from Australia, left Australia on the 11th of last month, could not arrive in Shanghai on schedule, and has been repeatedly postponed, as previously reported. Yesterday, the local agent of the ship received a cable from the ship, saying that after loading coal in Yokohama, it was about to raise anchor, but the machinery was suddenly damaged. It is currently hiring craftsmen to repair it, and it is estimated that it will take a week to complete the work. Therefore, the ship's arrival in Shanghai will have to be delayed until around the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Yarn: 20-Count Yarn is Considered Surplus; Market Price Falls by 1-2 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market shows a significant calm. The actual demand is still not strong. However, due to the lack of spindles for spinning 32-count fine yarn, the production is naturally reduced. The inventory in the market is exhausted, and the spring sales season has arrived. The demand in the market has risen slightly, and the market price is unusually brisk. The Tianjin merchants in the north continue to purchase 10-count coarse yarn, and they are constantly searching for it in the market. Not only the selling price is not loose, but it has increased instead. This is because the supply of actual goods cannot meet the demand for a while. However, 20-count yarn is in abundance in the hands of hoarders, and the factory's production has increased. In addition, the situation in southern Fujian and Shantou has become tense recently, and Japanese warships are clustered in Hainan Island, causing unrest. People's hearts are also affected by it.</p>
<p>The situation in the current yarn market is that the opening in the early morning is a bleak scene. Colleagues gather together and talk about empty things. There are no commissions from mobile brokers in the market, and no telegrams from customers come to Shanghai to handle goods. Therefore, the market cannot be opened until after 10 o'clock. After the colleagues entered 15 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn, the price was 400 yuan, similar to the previous day, but the momentum was slightly weak. After a while, because the customer sales did not rise, it fell by 1-2 yuan to 398 yuan. However, in the transaction of 10-count coarse yarn, Tianjin merchants continued to absorb it tirelessly, and all the spot goods in the market were absorbed, and the factory's quota was also opened a lot, so the popularity was slightly higher. By the closing, 20-count Double Horse yarn returned to 399.5 yuan. In the afternoon, because the Saturday gathering was sparsely attended, the market was even more sluggish, and the Rong merchants' business was not prosperous. As a result, the total turnover for the whole day was 1,450 bales. The market price was that 10-count coarse yarn was firm as usual, 20-count Double Horse yarn was down 1.5 yuan from the previous day, Tiannv was down 1.5 yuan, Te Jincheng was down 2 yuan, and 32-count fine yarn rose by 3 yuan. The factory did not take any action. Today, 105 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 350 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 355 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 1,355 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. The amount of spot yarn bought by each merchant is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market did not have much improvement compared to the previous day. Except for Tianjin merchants, business in other regions was still rare. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn was 335 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix was 328.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Huaxin Yarn Factory Relocates to Shanghai and Reorganizes</h3>
<p>After the cotton yarn market price soared last year, the profits of yarn factories were abundant, setting a new record after the outbreak of the European war. Therefore, new yarn factories began to be established in Shanghai like mushrooms after a rain. It is heard that Qingdao Huaxin Yarn Factory, in view of avoiding unnecessary sacrifices in this national war, dismantled the yarn and transported it to Shanghai. It has now found a factory site on Moganshan Road and reorganized it into a Sino-British joint venture, named Xinyi Yarn Factory. The factory is large in scale, with 30,000 spindles for yarn and 250 looms. The production volume in the future will be very large. It is found that its trademarks are 32-count and 42-count Songlu, Wuzi, 20-count yarn Wuzi, 10-count coarse yarn Jiu Yu, and the fabric trademark is Duobao.</p>

<h3>Local Cotton Transactions are Still Lively</h3>
<p>Although the local cotton business is improving, the demand from the ancestral factories is still calm. However, the transactions of the firms are more lively. It is found that the number of entries is very cumbersome, but the "baojiao" is very rare. As for the flower shops, in view of the lack of local cotton goods, they have changed their minds and ordered Indian cotton. The transaction is becoming more and more prosperous, which shows the dryness of the local cotton situation. In addition to Yao Hua occasionally arriving in Shanghai, there are very few sources from various routes. The amount of spot cotton transacted and the market price are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Prices are Too High; Cotton Merchants Have No Transactions</h3>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market is very active, rising for many days. The price of March cotton has reached a new peak in eight days. According to the current trend of people's hearts, the cotton market is still expected to rise. The date of the vote on Smith's cotton industry proposal will be postponed to the 9th of this month. It is widely rumored that American farmers unanimously oppose the sale of loan cotton. Yesterday, New York rose another 3-4 points. The Bombay cotton market was suspended again yesterday due to the death of a broker. However, a major foreign firm received a cable from India, predicting that Balloch would be 154 rupees and a half, a sharp increase of more than 2 rupees compared to the closing price of the previous day. Egyptian cotton fell back 8-9 points. Yesterday, the foreign exchange rate rose slightly. The legally converted cotton price in legal currency was that American cotton and Mash cotton each rose by 2 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by 4 jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell back by a small amount of over 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction has returned to a stagnant state. This is because the overseas cotton price is soaring. There were no transactions heard yesterday. If New York can fall back by 20 points, or India can fall back by 4-5 rupees, the factories will plan to purchase in large quantities again. The factory delivery prices of the cotton market yesterday are listed as follows. Sugar Market: The Number of Winter Diaocheng Output Sharply Decreased, Only One Third of Last Year's</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: The Number of Winter Diaocheng Output Sharply Decreased, Only One Third of Last Year's</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The guild's Liu Pan, 24 coarse white, and Taikoo Chebai were all quoted at the original price. Because it was Saturday, there were not many transactions. Guotang's goods had a few dozen bags of chong ti qing opened by the Chao gang, 15.7 jiao. The Jian gang opened about 400 bags of miscellaneous diaoyang, priced at 16.6 jiao, and several dozens of bags at 16.5 jiao. The price of Zhanglu Qing was still not close, and there were no transactions. It was found that the output of last winter was only one-third of the previous year, totaling more than 40,000 dan, while the total export volume in the 27th year was more than 140,000 dan. The sales in Wenzhou were the highest.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Many Goods from Wenzhou Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday's imports included 5,880 pieces of native paper, 2,440 pieces of pine boards, 170 barrels of raw lacquer, 750 cans of paint, and 544 pieces of tobacco leaves, all from Wenzhou to Shanghai. The export goods included 130 pieces of tin ingots shipped to Ningbo.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese and American Silk Prices Continue to Fall Slightly; Shanghai Silk Also Declines; Factory Brocade Has Entered the 1,900 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Foreign silk markets: Japan and the United States both fell back yesterday. Yokohama spot was 1,025 yuan, down 25 yuan from the previous day's close. Forward was 998 yuan, down 23 yuan from the previous day's morning market. New York spot fell by 5.5 cents, forward fell by 4 cents. Japanese silk at 7.75 cents and 8.3 cents each fell by 3-4 cents. The excessive surge in foreign silk prices this time was due to speculators, so the return of silk prices must be similar to the rising trend, with unexpected changes. The local silk market has been deeply affected, the market sentiment is more sluggish, and everyone is waiting and seeing. The B-grade of some white factory brocade has also entered the 1,900 yuan mark, and the selling price is 1,880 yuan. Although the transaction is small, the rising trend has been considerably frustrated, and compared with the high price of 1,960 yuan two days ago, it has actually fallen by as much as 60-70 yuan. There were no sales of foreign silk from British, American, Indian, and French firms yesterday. It is thought that the expansion of actual sales must wait for the silk market to return to normal before it is possible.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Source is Feared to be Cut Off; Raw Oil Soars by One Yuan; Soybean Oil Rises Endlessly; Soybean Cake is Raised by Another 5 Cents</h3>
<p>Raw Oil: Subject to human control, the combined cost of appropriation and application must be over 40 yuan, resulting in a day when the source must be cut off. Therefore, the various gangs are keenly searching, and the market price is getting tighter. As a result, it soared by 1.8 yuan compared to the previous day. Jiaozhou oil was first opened at 23.8 yuan, and instantly jumped out of the 24 yuan mark, closing at 24.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose another 3 jiao, closing at 24.8 yuan. 50 barrels of Jiaozhou barrel oil were opened subsequently, priced at 32.5 yuan, and 200 cans of Yanhao hearing oil, priced at 32 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: All concentrated in Dalian and advancing step by step. The rising trend seems to be endless, resulting in a chaotic situation in the market for a time. As a result, all spot and future oils rose wildly by 4-6 jiao. It is estimated that 500 pieces of Yanqi oil (details in the market price column), 200 large baskets and 100 small baskets of Lianqi oil, 700 barrels of Dalian oil on the spot, 200 barrels in early March, more than 900 barrels in late March, and 100 barrels of Fengnian oil were also ordered for delivery in late March.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: Still only has the power of Dalian. It is estimated that 15,000 pieces were thrown open for delivery in April, with a price of 3.25 yuan, 5 cents higher than the previous day's market. There were no other transactions, because the price of soybeans jumped wildly, the cost was high, and the selling price did not match, so purchasers held back.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Quanzhou Soaked Longan is Opened at More Than 3,000 Boxes</h3>
<p>The total amount of large soaked longan from Quanzhou that has arrived before and after has reached more than 4,000 boxes. Because the bid price was not suitable last winter, it was not opened. Now, when the spring market is met, the price is negotiated again. Yesterday, only 3,000 boxes were transacted. The price of large particles increased by 1.7-1.8 yuan compared to the previous rise, and the next grade varied by several jiao. The small particles were still ordinary because the going was slower.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Yuanhu Has Sparse Destinations</h3>
<p>Yuanhu is divided into four grades. It is found that the total stock here is only 40-50 pieces. Recently, the sales have been mostly small-scale retail in this street. It is estimated that the sales price is 58 yuan for the Xiu Ti, 54 yuan for the Kui Ti, 51 yuan for the San Ti, and 49 yuan for the Si Lian. There was no honor or disgrace compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Variegated Sea Cucumber, the Stock of Western Goods is Limited</h3>
<p>The recent transactions of variegated sea cucumber Western goods are not lonely, because the old stock is limited, and the trend is firm. The selling price is estimated to be 167 yuan to 290 yuan for the Fan Wu, 128 yuan to 250 yuan for the Wang Wu, 365 yuan to 440 yuan for the Meihua ginseng, 265 yuan to 315 yuan for the Baihua, and 165 yuan to 211 yuan for the Jinshan strip.</p>
<h3>Coal: Kailuan Coal, the Domestic Price Increases by 4 Yuan</h3>
<p>The situation of bituminous coal continues to rise, and the selling prices have mostly increased. The only reason is that the foreign exchange is tight and the cost is increased. Yesterday, Kailuan Mining Company also notified the managerial shops that the domestic prices of Kailuan lump coal and special dross have increased by 4 yuan. Because the arrival of No. 2 dross is surplus, the price will not be raised temporarily. The hearts of the people are shaken, and the market situation is getting tighter. Colleagues are making transactions, and it is very lively. It is estimated that the price of tong coal is 36 yuan per ton, the screening block is 38 yuan, and the lifting block is 40 yuan. The total transaction is 600-700 tons.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Raincoat Cloth is in Short Supply; Selling Prices Suddenly Rise</h3>
<p>There is a shortage of newly arrived and existing raincoat cloth. Only Yikang, Hengwu, and Changji have some stock. Very few colleagues are operating. Therefore, the standards are firm, both bright and dark. Although there are definite arrivals from non-Western goods Japanese foreign firms, the number is not large, and the prices have suddenly increased by several jiao. General numbers have secretly agreed to transactions with each other, and they are using techniques of controlling and releasing wholesale to absorb and retail to operate and make profits. Yesterday, the British-made Changhui single-sided waterproof mi was sold at 8.5 yuan per yard for spot delivery, and the Baobielin was sold at 8 yuan. The prices of Japanese double-sided yarn raincoat cloth rose together, and the current price was 2.1 yuan. The sub-number was 1.85 yuan, the Baobielin was 1.9 yuan, the No. 2 was 1.6 yuan, the Chongji reverse head number was 0.85 yuan, and the No. 2 was 0.725 yuan.</p>
<p>There were 170 pieces of cotton cloth piece goods exported to Shantou today, 240 pieces to Hong Kong, 185 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 550 pieces to Haiphong. Only 525 pieces were shipped to Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<h3>The N呢絨 (Woolen Fabric) Industry: Why Not Plan for Itself?</h3>
<p>We truly feel that everyone mostly only sees the surface of that isolated island, but overlooks its implicit substance, just as Mr. Longju Sheng of Mukan dissected "The Tragedy of the Yarn and Cloth Industry" in a previous article: "Knowing one thing, but not knowing the other." — That is, like the article "The Prosperous N呢絨 Industry" published in yesterday's newspaper; indeed, it told us a lot about the booming business of n呢絨 merchants; but apart from those in the n呢絨 industry itself, who knows the hidden dangers and worries behind these joyful scenes!</p>
<p>We have studied the reasons why the isolated island is so abnormally prosperous, and the main reasons are probably nothing more than: (1) Due to the war, with the enemy cavalry everywhere, the more wealthy people have come to the isolated island to take refuge and seek survival; (2) Due to the inconvenient transportation in the suburbs, coupled with special forces, it is not easy for goods shipped from other ports to Shanghai to arrive, resulting in a situation where demand exceeds supply, and prices have risen day by day: especially n呢絨, which is listed as one of the imported goods, after the government authorities implemented foreign exchange control, because foreign exchange is difficult to obtain, and the arrival of goods is hindered, the price has risen even higher!</p>
<p>However, the above-mentioned situation of shortage and price increase only applies to products from European and American countries; in fact, it is also due to the above situation that has created this dangerous worry in the n呢絨 industry today—that is, the problem of dumping of Eastern goods!</p>
<p>Taking Japan as an example, their daily military invasion expenses of tens of millions of yuan have exhausted them domestically, so they want to seek it from the Chinese people in our occupied areas, which is originally a "wishful thinking"; and for the general profit-oriented people in our n呢絨 industry, as long as they can "make money," they don't need to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves; and on the other hand, due to the war, the economic ability of those wealthy foreign-dressed customers has been reduced, and they are more "willing" to wear cheap foreign clothes, etc. These aspects of certainty make us understand that the "prosperous" n呢絨 industry last year was actually due to the "neighboring country's" grace!</p>
<p>But when I glanced at so many refugees huddled in the streets and alleys—they are all recipients of the artillery fire, struggling on the line of starvation and death; when I read the heroic sacrifices of the soldiers on the front line, I sincerely hope that the happy people in the "profitable" and "prosperous" n呢絨 industry will quickly consider the future of the entire country and nation, which is actually considering their own permanent future!</p>
<p>—Tang Jun, midnight, February 27th</p>
<h3>Metals: A Lot of New Lead Wire is Sold, White Lead Wire Also Has Smooth Sales to Fujian and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The market for new lead wire was exceptionally good yesterday and the day before yesterday. The market traded more than two or three thousand bundles. The price has risen slightly. For example, No. 16 to No. 20 were sold for 22.5 yuan per bundle, and No. 21 to No. 25 were priced at 27.25 yuan per bundle. Merchants from the north were very interested in buying, but they could not be shipped for export, so they were mostly waiting and seeing. In addition, several hundred bundles were also sold to various gangs in Fujian and Zhejiang yesterday.</p>
<p>The market for white lead wire after the new lead wire is also quite brisk. The prices have risen by three or four corners. For example, No. 1 to No. 6 are estimated at 15 yuan per bundle, No. 7 to No. 11 are sold for 15.7 yuan per bundle, No. 12 to No. 13 are priced at 16 yuan per bundle, and No. 14 onwards to fine patterns are priced at 17 yuan per bundle. The sales are also greatest to customers from other provinces. It is estimated that more than a thousand bundles were sold in the past two days, all purchased by gangs from Fujian and Zhejiang. The actual sales in this street are also good.</p>

<h3>### Fundamental Solution</h3>
<p>— Li Shi</p>
<p>According to statistics: In February, a total of 18 bloody cases occurred in this city, resulting in 21 deaths and 10 injuries. Nine of the bloody cases occurred in the Public Concession, three in the French Concession, and six outside the two concessions. The causes included 13 cases with political nature, two cases of resisting arrest, and three cases of vendettas. The former is a record of punishing traitors, and the latter two are confessions of urban crimes.</p>
<p>The killing of traitors is the inevitable result of their shameless service to the enemy and recognition of the enemy as their father. Therefore, the general public is not surprised by these bloody cases, nor do they feel sorry for the dead; on the contrary, they believe that they deserve their sins and deserve to die; however, those killed "new nobles" have different amounts of money and different degrees of sin, which have caused some different attention and reactions in society. For example, the death of the pseudo "Foreign Minister" Chen Lu, because the sins he committed during his lifetime were relatively serious, the general public paid more attention to it and had a reaction. It is precisely for this reason that it has also been used as a blackmailing material.</p>
<p>It is said that in order to avoid unnecessary negotiations caused by Chen Lu's assassination, the parties concerned have agreed on a principle of compromise. As for the detailed terms, there will be another decision within two weeks. Is this a victory for "silent warfare" or a victory for "calmly responding"? Is it a failure of the intimidators or a failure of the compromisers? We are not willing to comment further at this time. But we believe that the request to prevent the recurrence of traitor-killing cases cannot be effective by relying solely on the crackdown clauses established through compromise. It must be understood that the action of punishing traitors is a spontaneous patriotic behavior of the Chinese people in the war of resistance. If the general "new nobles" no longer hide in the concessions to engage in illegal activities in the future, then this kind of action will naturally stop. Therefore, to ensure the safety of the concessions, we should first step up the prevention of the activities of the "new nobles" in the concessions. This is the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>We sympathize with the difficulties of the concession authorities, and at the same time, we express our highest respect for the past efforts of the concession authorities to maintain the security of the concessions. If the concession authorities believe that the recent frequent bloody cases and the proliferation of difficulties, then they should take the "fundamental solution" to deal with the current situation.</p>
<h3>### The Shady Story of Obtaining Manuscripts by Deception</h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>The poverty of writers is truly a universal phenomenon. Although Shanghai is the cultural center of the country, the poverty of writers is no less than that of the interior. Therefore, they have to rely on a worn-out pen, racking their brains and stepping up the work of writing, trying to exchange pieces of paper densely written with words for pieces of bread to maintain their lives. Even if we put aside all the external pressures imposed on writers, the material environment of writers is miserable enough. However, there are many unscrupulous people who seize on the weakness of writers' poverty, using various fraudulent means to obtain the manuscripts squeezed out of writers' brains in order to achieve their profit-making goals. Shanghai is a "man eats man" society, which is further believed.</p>
<p>Once, in the classified advertisements in the newspaper, I found an advertisement for "soliciting manuscripts": stating that each thousand words would be paid two to five yuan, and would be returned if not used. At that time, I sent a manuscript and stated at the end of the manuscript that if it was decided not to use it, the manuscript must be returned according to the address; but after sending it, it was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no news. Later, I accidentally saw a magazine at a newsstand, in which there was an article that was very similar to the article I sent, but with a different title, and the signature below was naturally not the original. I was so angry with the despicable means of the fraudster that I wrote a letter to the editor of the magazine, but I did not receive an explanation or reply. I guess there must be many people who have been deceived like me, right?</p>
<p>Another time, it was my friend who went to take the "translator" test. Because the salary was 80 yuan a month after being hired, and there was hope for promotion and salary increase if the level was excellent or the work was serious. Therefore, my friend, who was being attacked by the pain of unemployment, resolutely went. The examination procedure was very simple. Just translate a section of a certain book into Chinese and then take an oral test. My friend and other candidates naturally worked hard to bury themselves in translation. The gentleman who took the oral test also solemnly said to each candidate: After the review, the admitted will be notified. But it was agreed that the results would be announced in ten days, but there was no movement after twenty days. At that time, everyone thought that their level was poor and they had to blame themselves for losing such an excellent opportunity. But the shady story was finally discovered, because several friends with very good English skills went to take the test at the same time. Everyone was looking forward to the good news during the announcement period, but the result was disappointing. Not many days later, a Chinese translation of a certain book was sold in the market. It turned out that they had worked as voluntary translators for a few hours that day. The sections translated by each person were different. They were collected, slightly altered, and became a translated work. The ingenuity of their intentions is truly admirable.</p>
<p>There are also many new newspapers and magazines that publish "manuscript solicitation regulations" in their publications. The standard of remuneration is of course very high, but most of the people who submit manuscripts have wasted their efforts and gained nothing. The author has encountered such facts several times.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that the ×× monthly magazine hosted by a certain party is also using this method to solicit manuscripts. I hope that my colleagues will not be deceived by it, because this is not a simple manuscript fee issue, but will cause us to suffer a lifelong bad name, and at the same time, in terms of objective effect, it will give the enemy a "cultural cooperation" convenience.</p>
<p>Shanghai is truly a city where fraud is prevalent, and even writers cannot escape the deception of fraud. This article is also considered to be exposing some shady stories.</p>
<h3>### The Case of a Dancing Girl's Suicide</h3>
<p>— Fei Ren</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are more than tens of thousands of poor women living a dark, hell-like life. Dancing girls are one of them. On the surface, being a dancing girl is indeed a free women's profession, but in this big city known as the den of sin, their backs are closely followed by the shadows of demons. Except for a very small number who voluntarily threw themselves into this world of wine and flesh because of their poor family conditions; others, as far as we know, some are abducted from the interior, and some, like "contract workers" in factories, imprison other people's daughters at extremely low prices to make them their cash cows, the so-called "× family sisters" are like this. Perhaps there are even more sinister and vicious shady stories, which outsiders cannot know.</p>
<p>The first type is not discussed. For the latter two types, their bodies have lost their freedom, and those procuress-like "Mamas" will naturally not let go, regardless of their lives, and squeeze money from them as much as possible. Recently, several news reports of dancing girls committing suicide have been found in the newspapers.</p>
<p>The reasons for their suicides can be summarized as nothing more than unsuccessful marriages, such as the sensational He Die suicide case; unbearable abuse, etc. These poor wronged souls naturally belong to the latter two types. As a weak woman, and without other skills to make a living, they have no other choice but to resort to this strategy when they cannot escape the clutches of the devil. Although their wisdom is foolish, their situation is indeed pitiful.</p>
<p>I remember when Carlton performed "Tears of Flowers," many viewers wept uncontrollably in the audience. It is said that they were all dancing girls. Then, of course, they saw their own shadows in Mimi and Gu Xiaomei, and shed tears of sympathy. But the purpose of "Tears of Flowers" is not to earn the tears of dancing girls. The awakened Dingxiang is a good example for every dancing girl.</p>
<p>This is not the playwright's fantasy. Among the thousands of dancing girls, there are such lovely girls. As soon as the sound of the Eight One Three sacred war of resistance was heard, many dancing girls washed away their makeup, put on white uniforms, and went to serve in military hospitals. Now, many dancing girls steal a little time from the Japanese and go to cram schools to study. "Recognize your identity and take on your responsibilities!" I hope everyone can accept the lesson given by "Tears of Flowers"!</p>
<p>Let me copy a sentence from Dingxiang again, "When you shouldn't die, don't commit suicide in despair. When you should die, don't escape from death in fear"!</p>
<h3>### People Who Eat from a Golden Bowl: The Life of Bank Employees</h3>
<p>— Bank Employee</p>
<p>(1) The golden bowl is no longer a metaphor for eating bank food</p>
<p>This is an enviable name—bank food is a golden bowl. But what is the situation now? Is bank food still a golden bowl? A quick answer is needed. But this cannot be seen on the surface: the tall and large buildings of the banks, the magnificent equipment, are still standing there, displayed as before, perhaps even more "tall," "large," "refined," and "beautiful," although its business has been affected by the social and economic depression, and it has adopted a conservative policy for external lending.</p>
<p>In the past: Every bank could earn several hundred thousand or several million yuan every year; they all came from operating government bonds and real estate. In recent years, the environment has changed, and the operation of these two has been restricted in various ways; on the one hand, they are hesitant to move forward with "rural loans" that are beneficial to "national economy and people's livelihood"—of course, the funds for rural loans are much slower to turn over. Under such conditions, the annual surplus will naturally decrease year by year. The "year-end bonuses" for employees were originally based on three months' salary for each person; in addition, there was a distribution of "special bonuses" depending on the annual surplus, at least one month, and often more than the "ordinary bonus." In this way, a bank employee with a monthly salary of 30 or 40 yuan would have an income of 100 to 200 yuan at the end of the year—although it is not comparable to the "dividends" of 10 or 20 years ago, which were based on the annual surplus, and ordinary staff could also get hundreds or thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>However, since the outbreak of the war the year before last, several banks still issued the "year-end bonus" as usual for three months, several for one month, but there was more than one that issued "not a penny," and even laid off many bank employees under the pretext of "idle business," "saving expenses," and so on. The names were nominally different: some were "dispersed," some were "dismissed," and some were "suspended with pay retained." Originally, bank employees in the so-called golden bowl bank would never be dismissed without a major fault—since the internal and external situation is like this; the adjective "golden bowl" is no longer appropriate for banks. Now, we can only call it a "cracked" bowl, at most just a "gilded" one.</p>
<p>(2) Rank promotion and salary</p>
<p>If bank employees are divided by rank, they can be roughly divided into four levels: managers, deputy managers, and assistant managers. This single-person management personnel is one level, the heads of departments, section chiefs, and group leaders are one level, the clerks and assistants are one level, and the trainees and office workers or those called waiters are another level. In the past—the trainees of each bank were responsible for delivery work, similar to the apprentices in old-fashioned stores. In recent years, several banks have added many office workers under the principle of saving expenses. The salary of office workers is less than that of trainees, and the status is also below that of trainees. The work they do is what the trainees used to do; in this way, the status of trainees has increased and increased, and the work they do is almost the same as that of assistants and clerks. Trainees can be promoted to assistants in about three years, but it is not certain. It is easier for assistants to be promoted to clerks; if you want to be promoted to director, section chief, or deputy manager, if you have no relationship with the "authorities," then it can be said to be a "dream." Just look at the deputy managers, assistant managers, or section chiefs of several banks today, who are not the "close friends" of the managers, or those introduced by them, and you can understand.</p>
<p>Speaking of salary, people outside who do not know the inside think that an ordinary bank employee can have one or two hundred or at least sixty or seventy yuan a month. However, their ideals are ideals, and the facts are facts. Ideals are often contrary to facts; banks, like other companies, are also divided into large and small. In several large banks, a trainee who does not provide board and lodging can have thirty or fifty yuan a month, an assistant can have eighty or ninety yuan, and the salaries of clerks and above are naturally even higher. But what about several small banks? A trainee who provides board and lodging has only a little more than ten yuan, and some have only six or seven yuan a month. An assistant has only twenty or thirty yuan, and a clerk has only thirty or fifty yuan; imagine a clerk who has at least three or four years of history in the bank, and often seven or eight years, with an age between twenty or thirty and thirty or forty, and has a considerable burden on the family. However, the monthly income is only as mentioned above. What will the bank employees who eat from a golden bowl think about this? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>### After the Rain, the Sky is Clear</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Spring Comes to Biluo, Fragrance Floats on the Snowy Sea, Flowers Fly in Tiger Hill, Moon Fills Li Lake</p>
<p>Because Zhu Ai didn't like to go to the Stone Lake Academy, they said: Let's sit there for a while, and then we'll go eat. The two Miss He had never been there before and didn't know where to go. Zhu Ai also rarely went out to travel. Today, she was really stealing a moment of leisure, entirely relying on Wu Junsu to guide them. But Wu Junsu was not a good guide. After all, she rarely went out to play and was not very familiar with the place. Wu Junsu said, "There is a Zhiping Temple over there. Shall we go in and donate some money?" Zhu Ai also shook her head. At this time, the car slowly drove along the lakeside until it reached a waterside pavilion. It was a brothel, with the words "Idle Clouds" written on it. The place was quite refined and clean. Zhu Ai said, "I haven't been to a teahouse for tea in several years. How about we go inside for a cup of tea, sisters?" The two Miss He didn't care either way. Seeing the words "Idle Clouds," Zhu Ai's heart was moved. She thought that she was busy every day and might as well be idle for a while today. Who knew that the waterside pavilion was in a very good location, where they could see the entire lake. They sat down, and the waiter came to greet them and brought four cups of tea. They saw many yachts on the lake, but small motorboats were flying by from time to time in the distance. Wu Junsu said, "Some people say that Stone Lake in Suzhou can be compared to West Lake in Hangzhou, but they are really very different. Sisters, have you been to West Lake in Hangzhou?" He Liyu said, "We haven't been there." Wu Junsu said, "Since the two sisters have come here, you must go to West Lake in Hangzhou once. It is a natural large park in China. Our Chinese mountains and rivers are beautiful, and our culture has been passed down for a long time. Although there are natural parks everywhere in the country, West Lake in Hangzhou is a world-famous large park and must be visited. Although many villas and mansions have been built around Stone Lake in recent years, it is like a small witch seeing a great witch compared to West Lake in Hangzhou. And the biggest difference is that West Lake is a world of its own and is not connected to the outer river. All the boats in West Lake cannot go outside, and the boats outside cannot come to West Lake. It is better to be so isolated, so that the boats cannot be mixed, otherwise West Lake cannot be so clean. Also, because Zhejiang is near the sea, the Qiantang River has tides every day. If West Lake is connected to the outside, there will be problems with the tide entering West Lake. I remember that in the past, a certain gentleman had never been to West Lake and only relied on his imagination to describe the night tide in the lake, but he didn't know that West Lake has never been connected to the tide since ancient times. As for Stone Lake, it cannot be isolated from the outside world like West Lake!" (52)</p>

<h3>Prospects for the Old Drama (5)</h3>
<p>— Yu Tang</p>
<p>For example, in the play "Cutting Down Zidu," according to the plot, Gongsun Zidu was jealous of talent and greedy for merit, and secretly calculated against Ying Kaoshu. He should be spurned and disgusted by people, but sometimes it is not always the case. If the person playing Zidu is a well-known Wusheng (martial male) who relies on his acting skills, the appearance on stage will attract a full house of applause, and then many explosive fights and heavy movements will receive more applause. On the other hand, Ying Kaoshu, because he is relegated to a supporting role, dies in vain and does not attract attention. Another example is "Looking at Xiaoyaojin." If the person who plays Cao Cao is a Jing (painted-face male), when he enters the palace with a sword, threatens the emperor, and reveals his treacherous appearance, the audience will definitely applaud and praise his acting skills; on the other hand, if the Sheng (male) who plays the prince makes a wrong step on the stage or forgets the lines, the audience will not give him a bad review because they sympathize with him as a dying emperor. This is also a real example of the old drama changing with the acting skills.</p>
<p>The result of this abnormal development is that the rise and fall of the old drama closely follows the merits and demerits of the actors. The audience's appreciation is concentrated on the acting skills of the actors, and the consciousness of the whole play is lightly ignored. On the one hand, because the famous actors occupy the large theaters and sell at high prices, the public does not have the opportunity to appreciate his acting skills. When Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu perform alone, the ticket price is often three or four yuan. Even if the plot is advanced and the acting skills are superb, it is only enough for the appreciation of dignitaries and wealthy merchants, and the petty citizens have no chance to ask about it. They have to flock to the unhealthy civilian theaters to appreciate the low-level and nonsensical dramas. As a result, the status of the old drama is getting lower and lower, and the level of the audience is also being pulled into the same stream.</p>
<p>In addition, those very few researchers who are loyal to the old drama lament the daily decline of the old drama, and are sincerely afraid that the models of their predecessors will be lost and lost, so they engage in research and strive to collect and preserve all the essence of the old drama. Most of them use their amateur qualifications and spend more than twenty or thirty years using the attitude of appreciating pure literature to appreciate the old drama. They have had good opportunities in the past to personally see the acting skills of first-class advanced actors, and they have discussed with them. They are familiar with all the skills of the old drama. They love the old drama as much as playing with calligraphy, painting, and antiques. They only know that they should cherish and preserve it. This group of people is represented by Qi Rushan in the north and Su Shaoqing and Xu Muyun in the south. Naturally, their stubborn and conservative attitude will be rejected as being ignorant and old-fashioned by those who claim to be progressive; but looking at the new position of the old drama today, I think their attitude is accurate, their efforts are the most effective, and although they have not made any contributions to the old drama before, because of their loyal attitude, they have made meritorious service in protecting the old drama when it is about to perish.

<h3>Listening to Yang Baosen Perform "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao" in the New Year</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>On the sixth day of the first month of the abandoned calendar, a friend invited me to listen to Huangjin Yang Baosen perform "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao." When I arrived, it was just 8:15 PM. On stage, "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao" had already reached the scene where Cao Cao was killing his family. Li Kechang, who played Cao Cao, had proper form in both singing and dialogue. It's a pity his voice lacked resonance and his physique lacked height. However, among the performers of Cao Cao today, he is already a rare find. Yang Baosen's voice has improved compared to last year. The portrayal of the tense situation during the "killing the family" scene was insufficient. In terms of his singing technique, the two lines, "His entire family suffered disaster," and "It scared me, making my spirit scatter," were not well-executed. As for the "Chen Gong's heart is like a knife stabbing" section in the rapid-fire aria, most famous actors of today don't sing this section well. Baosen is relatively better. In the line "Thanks to the old gentleman," Baosen adds an unnecessary 'xi' sound to the word "gentleman." It would be better to use the original pronunciation. The 'e' sound in the word "evil" should be a nasal sound, but Baosen pronounces it incorrectly. Seeing the old gentleman being killed, singing "Chen Gong ah" in a falsetto would be best, but Baosen sings it in a monotone, probably because he can't reach the high notes. If he's going to sing it in a monotone, it would be better to sing the line "Chen Gong saw him, his throat went hoarse" continuously, without pausing. As for the long "Hearing his words" section in the "Xipi Manban" tempo, it was quite wonderful, but I don't think it's right for him to completely imitate Little Yu. As evidenced by Little Yu's recording, the word "wo" (I) is unnecessarily added before "zij zuo cha" ("to do the errand myself"). This creates a redundancy with the "wo" in "wo nanyi huima" ("I find it hard to turn back"). Little Yu doesn't realize this, and those who imitate him blindly are laughable. Moreover, there are many "wo" words in this section, so Tan Xinpei's singing method doesn't use the added "wo" before "zij zuo cha." The rules of melody prohibit excessive use of padding words; excessive use is considered vulgar. I hope those who learn this section from Little Yu will pay attention to correcting it. (The two words "zancie" ["for the moment"] also suffer from this redundancy and can be deleted.) Also, at the end of the line "quanxie yu ta" ("persuade him"), a soft "ya" sound is added after the word "ta" ("him"). This is also learned from Little Yu's recording. Little Yu doesn't realize that this word is most inconsistent with the principles of pronunciation. For words in the "jia ma" rhyme (i.e., the "hua fa zhe"), it's forbidden to change the sound to a soft "ya" sound because this rhyme is a diphthong, and the vowel is an "ah" sound. Changing the sound to "ya" or "yo" makes it a floating tone. Little Yu is known as a follower of Tan, with a great reputation, and some even say he understands phonetics, yet he adds "ya" after "ta," which is a major violation of musical rules. Those who imitate him don't know how to choose and also learn his faults, so I point it out specifically. The "One round bright moon" section in the "erhuang" style was sung well. "Doubting too much" – the word "te" ("too") is pronounced as "tai" ("very"), and also slides into the middle note, which is also a major deviation from the singing method. There are also several reversed words, which I won't elaborate on now. Baosen has high expectations, so I offer these criticisms in pursuit of perfection.</p>
<h3>Ice Skating Techniques (11)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Junqi Zhen</p>
<p>Beginner's Guide (Continued)</p>
<p>(9) If both feet move using the outer edges of the skates, then before changing feet, when the movement of the primary foot is about to end, the center of gravity must be temporarily shifted to the inner edge of the skate, so that the next propulsion is smoother. However, this action is not necessary for cross-legged movements, as the outer edge of the skate must be used for propulsion. Similarly, this action is not necessary when moving using the inner edge of the skate.</p>
<p>(10) Progress should be gradual, and success is assured. The so-called order is:</p>
<p>1.  First learn the methods of moving forward, backward, stopping, and turning. 2. Learn the body's utilization methods and the four basic edges (eight positions). 3. Learn cross-over eights and three-turns. 4. Learn other various turns, such as forward and backward rockers and reverse three-turns, etc. 5. Learn the figures and free variations done by experts.</p>
<p>Only by learning the first three steps completely can you hope to pass the elementary level test (see Examinations and Competitions).</p>
<p>Body Utilization Methods</p>
<p>(A) Body Posture: The position of the body's center of gravity, the movements of the arms, legs, and hips, the flexibility of the waist and knees, and even every single movement of each part of the body, all have refined and vulgar aspects. Refinement leads to graceful posture. When it comes to ice skating, posture is especially crucial. Whether in competitions, tests, or free skating, the first requirement is the ability to perform various figures, and the second is to pay attention to the elegance of posture. Elegant posture leads to natural movements, correct footwork, and innovative figures, thus mastering the art of ice skating. Skaters should pay attention to the whole body, not just the skates, as the body is more important and comes before the feet, and the feet are merely a part of the body.</p>
<p>Body: The body should be straight but not stiff, and it should be stable and controlled, so that the limbs are balanced and can be used freely. The body should be light, so that it moves like a startled swan, and comes like a swimming dragon.</p>
<p>Head: The head should be held high, and the eyes should not look down constantly.</p>
<p>Hands: The hands should not be clenched tightly, nor should the palms be spread open.</p>
<p>Arms: The arms should hang down naturally and should not be forced.</p>
<p>Waist: The waist should not be bent, i.e., the waist should not be bent forward or to the side.</p>
<p>Knees: The knees should be flexible and slightly bent, and able to bend deeply. The body should rise and fall using knee bending.</p>
<p>Legs: When moving, the motion should originate from the hips, not the knees. The thighs should not be squeezed together.</p>
<p>Toes: When lifting the foot, the toes should point downwards. When the toes leave the ground, they should be straight and pointing outwards, like in a race.</p>
<p>Attention should be paid to swinging the whole body. The movements of each part should be relaxed and composed. The body and limbs should be parallel to the direction of movement. When turning, the hips should be used for rotation. The most common mistake is a curved body and bent waist, which is most easily seen when moving on the outer edges of the skates.</p>
<h3>Li Li Goes Missing Again in Peiping</h3>
<p>— (Nie Ge, from Hong Kong)</p>
<p>After Li Li arrived in Hong Kong from Peiping, she was hired by Lianyi Film Company to star in "A Stunning Beauty." When the film was mostly completed, complications arose, and production was halted for some time. It was only completed near the end of the lunar year. Because the cast and crew liked her, Li, to foster camaraderie, threw a New Year's Eve dinner party for the "A Stunning Beauty" staff. They reveled and drank freely, enjoying themselves immensely. Li, having drunk too much, lost her composure and sang loudly and incoherently. The surrounding neighbors were alarmed and came to investigate. The next day, Li suddenly disappeared. It turned out that she had secretly left Hong Kong. Rumors abounded. Some said she went to Hanoi, others said she went to San Francisco to attend the Golden Gate Exposition, others said she went to Chongqing, and still others said she came to Shanghai, as a major Shanghai company had invited her to star in a film. The situation is confusing and unpredictable. Li Li is indeed a mysterious woman.</p>
<p>According to informed sources, Li did indeed fly to Chongqing. She will return to Hong Kong in twenty days. It is said that Li wore a brown Western-style outfit and a coffee-colored wide-brimmed felt hat, and took several suitcases with her.</p>
<h3>News from the Entertainment World</h3>
<p>Female impersonator Li Xuefang suddenly developed a fever and chills backstage last night. After examination and treatment by Dr. Wang Zhenchuan, he was diagnosed with a throat ailment and given an injection. Xuefang was forced to cancel her performance. Female impersonator Zhao Junyan performed alone. Yesterday's daytime performance was performed by Xiao Linghong, and the evening performance was performed by Shen Yanqin, substituting the roles that Li Xuefang would have played.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinfang of the Yifeng Drama Society at the Carlton Theater will stage his self-written play "Courtesan." Preparations are underway.</p>
<p>After yesterday's performance, Huang Guiqiu rehearsed the new play "Lantern Riddles" with Du Fulong, San Jixian, and others. It is scheduled to be performed tonight. His masterpiece "Dou Qianniang" will also be presented to the public after "Butterfly Matchmaker."</p>
<p>Female impersonator Qiu Yunyan declined an invitation to guest star at the Modern Drama Theater. As female impersonator Liu Huiying is a regular performer at the theater, she felt it would be inappropriate to join. She is currently commissioning a large batch of costumes from Jiang Shunxing and will consider future plans after they are ready.</p>
<h3>The U.S. President's Son Also Enters the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Dan Yun</p>
<p>James Roosevelt, the eldest son of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, has always worked with his father, serving as his secretary in the White House. Recently, he abandoned his political career and joined Samuel Goldwyn Pictures, becoming a vice president. The company was founded by Samuel Goldwyn, a giant in the American film industry. This seems somewhat strange. Is the President's son a film buff? Let's see what he says himself: "I am very happy to be working with Mr. Goldwyn. I want to engage in an industry whose characteristic must be to serve the public. I have had this idea for a long time, and now I have the opportunity to join the film industry and work with Mr. Goldwyn to continue this service to the public and maintain a lasting record."</p>
<p>Therefore, James Roosevelt's entry into the film industry reveals something of his purpose. However, the Goldwyn Company has not yet announced the nature of his future position. Most people who care about this think that he will focus on the commercial aspects of it.</p>
<p>Those familiar with past events in Hollywood recall that in July of the previous year, Goldwyn invited Mrs. Roosevelt to write an article commenting on Goldwyn's film "Stella Dallas," in order to help promote the film. This article was published in almost all major magazines in the United States.</p>
<p>A few months ago, President Roosevelt gave a speech to a joint session of Congress. Goldwyn Company filmed it as a sound newsreel. According to Goldwyn's intention, he wanted to insert this newsreel into his recently produced film "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl," but he was ultimately unable to do so because President Roosevelt's secretary told Goldwyn that newsreels of President Roosevelt were not allowed to be inserted into money-making films.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (120)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>You Can't Make a Living in the Theater Without an Apprenticeship</p>
<p>Yang Baozhong, Ma Lianliang's qin player, is known to everyone as coming from a theatrical family. When he sang as a laosheng (old male role), he even apprenticed to Shu Yan. However, when he wanted to switch to the stage management profession, he had to first apprentice to the senior stage manager Geng Wu before he was officially allowed to make a living in this field. No matter which theater he encountered, the veterans of the percussion section of the civil and military scenes would take care of him. Before he apprenticed to Geng Wu, he did not seek Shu Yan's approval. When Yu Shu knew about it, he scolded him for deceiving his teacher and betraying his ancestors, and he was furious.</p>
<p>Recently, a good drummer has emerged in Beiping named Bai Dengyun. People call him Bai Deng. This man is in his forties and usually specializes in the style of Qiao San (named Yuquan, Lianliang's drummer), who is steady, accurate, and rarely misses a beat. Because he greatly admires Qiao San, and many friends encouraged him to go into the profession, he entrusted many influential people to ask Qiao San to accept him as a disciple. Who knew that Qiao San feared that he would steal his business (Qiao San's fee is the highest among all drummers in Beiping, but because of his high skill, actors feel that it is safer to hire him, so new actors who are making their debut often invite him. However, a single performance would cost at least thirty yuan), and he would not be able to arbitrarily raise his price, so he stubbornly refused to accept him. Some people, feeling indignant, brought out the old veteran Bao Guishan (often with Xiao Lou). These people were willing to spend a lot of money to treat him, to win this battle of wills. At that time, invitations were sent out. When Qiao San saw that it was his master's name, he dared not not come. When he arrived at the banquet, he realized that it was Bai Dengyun's apprenticeship feast. He did not want to be a master but instead became the senior brother, which was something he did not expect.</p>
<p>The above examples illustrate that making a living in the theater is indeed very difficult. Especially the phenomenon of insiders excluding outsiders, which is a unique characteristic of the old capital.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Reading and Studies</h3>
<p>— Big Child</p>
<p>—Review the Past, Strive for the Future</p>
<p>Time passes quickly. A long semester has already begun. Naturally, some have been held back because they failed the exam last semester, or cannot attend school due to complete failure. Some are certainly at the top of their class, but I think there must be quite a few who barely passed.</p>
<p>Everyone pays tuition to study and receives instruction from teachers. Why do some pass, some fail, and some even be at the top of the class? Dear children, have you thought about what the reason is?</p>
<p>Children, I will tell you, it is entirely because you do not work hard during ordinary times. Because you usually do not work hard on your studies, you only want to play and be lazy. So, at the end of the semester, the good and bad are separated. If you worked hard in ordinary times, then you wouldn't have to desperately cram right before the exam.</p>
<p>It is already embarrassing enough for your studies to be worse than others. How much more shameful is it to fail! How can you face the enthusiasm of your parents who are seeking education for you, how can you face the hard work of the teachers who are teaching you, and at the same time, how can you not feel ashamed in front of your classmates? However, "The past cannot be chased, the future can still be made." Dear children, the past is the past after all. Even if we regret it now, it is useless. Now that we understand our past mistakes, we only have to find ways to strive for our future, and work harder in this semester to make up for the previous deficiencies. This may still enable us to become good children.</p>
<p>However, the most important thing is that I hope that every child, regardless of whether they passed the last exam or not, can review everything from the past semester, whether in terms of studies or behavioral habits, and consider if they have had any unsuitable aspects. If so, then correct them. If not, then continue to encourage themselves. In this semester, we need to eliminate any unsuitable aspects or shortcomings and strive for academic success. "Knowing one's faults and changing them is good, not forgetting what one has learned," these are the words spoken by sages of ancient times. We may as well borrow them as a motto to encourage ourselves. Moreover, there have always been many poor and studious children throughout history who later became sages with great personalities, such as the stories of "carving a hole to steal light" and "studying hard on snowy nights." I think you may have read about them in textbooks. These are good examples for us to follow. Moreover, we all have such good environments, and we are truly the darlings of fate compared to them. If we still do not study hard now, not only will we waste precious time, but we will also be a little ashamed!</p>
<p>"If you don't work hard when you're young, you'll regret it when you're old!" Dear children, work hard! Let's not waste the time of this semester anymore and let other students be at the top of the class!</p>
<h3>Response to Fundraising for Refugee Production and Education Expenses</h3>
<p>— Wang Ling</p>
<p>This great movement has already begun on March 1st. Although you children are young and have limited knowledge, you are also part of the nation, and of course, you must also take on the responsibility of raising more than 100,000 yuan. If you respond with one heart and one mind, this movement will not be difficult to realize quickly, and the refugees will be able to acquire valuable survival skills soon.</p>
<p>Children, although you have experienced a period of change, you are fortunate enough to continue your studies and have a beautiful home environment. But around us, there are many refugees living lives worse than pigs and dogs. Why do they suffer so much? It is nothing more than their homes being destroyed, their businesses being lost, and wandering to Shanghai, with no relatives and cut off from their economy. They have nothing to eat or wear. For more than a year, although enthusiastic people have tried their best to help them, providing them with clothes to keep warm, food to fill their stomachs, and a place to live that shelters them from the rain and wind. However, if there is a lack of relief for even one day, the refugees will have to suffer from hunger, and the malnourished children will cry to their poor parents for food. Therefore, the relief method is not proper. So, under the needs of the environment, the "Fundraising Movement for Refugee Production and Education Expenses" was urgently promoted. This allows the refugees to obtain the most valuable treasure of life and prevents the children from wasting their precious time and studies. As for fundraising, I hope the children will pay attention to two points:</p>
<p>1.  Don't be afraid of less money, just be afraid of not doing it - Children, if you have a penny or a dime, don't think about what use these small amounts of money have. If you have five cents of snack money or candy money every day, wouldn't you be able to save one yuan in just twenty days? This one yuan can provide a child with tuition for a semester and enable a refugee to learn a skill. How great is the value of one yuan! If every child can save a cent, five cents, or a dime, I believe that the 100,000 refugees in Shanghai will be able to receive lifelong skills that they can never finish eating or using.</p>
<p>2.  Don't be afraid of not fulfilling your responsibility, just be afraid of not being able to raise money - Some children may think that asking people for money is a very embarrassing thing. Some have concerns beforehand. If they can't raise money and get rejected, wouldn't it be very embarrassing? If you have this kind of thinking, you will never be able to raise money because you don't have a sense of responsibility. If you are a child who is enthusiastic about fundraising, you will definitely not encounter difficulties. On the contrary, you will be touched by your patriotic and community-loving actions, and they will take it out without hesitation. Some people may even be ashamed that they don't have the same enthusiasm as you children. Therefore, your fundraising is a responsibility to society and an award to yourself. Isn't it killing two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>Let's start working hard today!</p>
<h3>Firecrackers</h3>
<p>— Wu Dingkang</p>
<p>Children, you have probably heard the name "firecrackers." There are many kinds of them, large and small. They all contain gunpowder. As long as you throw them on the ground, they will make a loud noise. Firecrackers are very cheap, and you can buy a few for just one or two cents. Firecrackers are most popular during the New Year and are the only entertainment for children. Besides that, there are many things like firecrackers, such as "Nine Dragons Take Water" and "Kaleidoscope," which are made of gunpowder. They are very beautiful when lit at night.</p>
<p>One day, I saw a group of children. They were divided into two teams, each with more than ten people. Each person held large and small firecrackers in their hands and shot at each other. For a while, there was a lot of cracking and popping sounds, as if a conflict had occurred and a war had started. They fought more and more fiercely. Hundreds of firecrackers were sacrificed, and the smell of gunpowder could be smelled at any time. They were unwilling to stop and continued to fight, as if they were fighting for their survival. Unexpectedly, tragedy struck; one child took a small firecracker and shot it at another child, accidentally hitting that child in the eye. Moreover, the small firecracker exploded. Then, red blood flowed from the child's eye, and he cried loudly. When the children saw that they had caused trouble, they scattered and ran away. Children, think calmly, what did they get from sacrificing hundreds of firecrackers, which is also sacrificing a lot of money? What was their result?</p>
<p>Children, although firecrackers are the only entertainment, they can also cause trouble if you are not careful. Moreover, firecrackers are a kind of consumable. In each year, I don't know how much money is sacrificed, and what you get is harm. If you donate that much money to buy firecrackers to the refugees, it would be much better. So, I hope that you children will absolutely ban playing firecrackers, because they are only harmful and have no benefits.</p>
<h3>Games in Cold Weather</h3>
<p>— Written by Ci Kai</p>
<p>Hide-and-seek is so much fun. Cover your eyes and don't look. Only allowed to hide in the corner, not allowed to crawl under the table. Although the weather is cold, everyone is playing and sweating.</p>
<p>In the alley, it's good to skip rope. Stick out your chest and put your feet together. Whoever jumps the most wins. My sister is jumping enthusiastically. She says, "Don't panic, please wait beside me!"</p>
<h3>Becoming a Little Radio Amateur (4)</h3>
<p>— Xi Ren</p>
<p>3.  Antenna and Ground Wire</p>
<p>After Wang Min recognized many components, he was naturally very happy, and he dragged his cousin's hand and said, "Brother, let's go play in the garden." His cousin said, "Okay," and they went out together.</p>
<p>Running into the garden, Wang Min suddenly saw something, but he didn't know what it was called and what it was for. This question had been in his mind for a long time. Today, it happened that his cousin was here, so he asked his cousin, "Brother, what is that wire stretched on the roof of that house for? Oh, there's one over there, there's one over here, oh, many, many."</p>
<p>His cousin looked up at what Wang Min was pointing at and said with a smile, "That's the gateway to radio."</p>
<p>"What? The gateway to radio? Then why is it installed on the roof?" Wang Min was confused.</p>
<p>His cousin knew that he was confused and explained to him, "Don't get me wrong, this is not a real gateway to the entrance of a house. This is a metaphor because the sounds of radio are transmitted from the antenna, just like people can walk into a house through the entrance, so I said that the antenna is the gateway to radio. Do you understand now?"</p>
<p>"Oh, so that's how it is." Wang Min nodded and said, "Then why do some use one wire, some use two wires, and some even use three or four wires? I also saw many wires stretched on the roof of the Zhongxi Pharmacy on the Fourth Road, and each wire was tied with a black thing. What are these things?"</p>
<p>Wang Min's cousin looked at Wang Min and said, "Yes, there are many styles of antennas. Some have one wire, some have two wires, and some have three or four wires put together. Actually, they all have the same use, just different styles. As for the one you saw on the roof of the Zhongxi Pharmacy, it is also called an antenna, but this kind of antenna is used in broadcasting stations, and ordinary radios don't need to be so particular."</p>
<p>"What are the black things on the wire?" Wang Min asked.</p>
<p>"Do you know what raw materials those black things are made of?" his cousin asked Wang Min.</p>
<p>"Is it iron?" Wang Min replied.</p>
<p>"No, it's made of glass or porcelain. Because as I said before, the sound waves of radio are transmitted from the antenna, but the sound waves are most easily transmitted away, so the large wire part must be isolated from other things. That black thing is used for this purpose. It can connect the antenna to other things, but the sound waves on the antenna will not be transmitted to other things because it has an insulating effect, so it is commonly called an 'insulator'."</p>
<p>"Oh, so there are so many tricks on the antenna. Before, I always thought that the antenna was unreasonable, just stretch a wire and it would work."</p>
<h3>Going on Board</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—Fourteenth of the Diary of Evading Disaster—</p>
<p>When Ming'er's father and Messrs. Zhang and Li returned to the transit house, a burly man with a swarthy face walked in.</p>
<p>"Are you the ones looking for a cabin?" he asked Mr. Li. "Yes, do you have a boat?" Mr. Li quickly replied. "I do have one, but someone has already booked it. However, that guest won't be leaving for another two or three days. But the rumors are swirling, so I think it's better to leave here sooner rather than later. If you want it, I can let you have it." "Then, how much to Tunxi, including the tip?" "Without food, the cheapest would be two hundred dollars." "Nonsense, nonsense, don't treat us like strangers. I travel up and down several times a year, and usually it's only eighty dollars." "Sir, this boat fare is earned with life. If a plane drops a bomb, it's not a game." "Alright, enough with the nonsense, let's be straightforward, one hundred dollars, will you go?" The boatman, hearing this, naturally didn't agree and left with a smile.</p>
<p>Ming'er's father and Mr. Zhang were delighted to hear that there was a boat.</p>
<p>The manager of the transit house walked over and said to Mr. Li, "These days, there are few boats and many people looking for one. If the situation continues to worsen day by day, we also want to return to our hometown. Add a little more, and ask him to concede a little, and that would be good. And I can guarantee that you'll have a very safe trip on this boat." So Mr. Li and Ming'er's father, Mr. Zhang, discussed it and added some to the boat fare. Later, the boatman also came, and after further haggling, they finally reached an agreement. Mr. Li felt the boat fare was a bit expensive, but Mr. Zhang was very impatient and decided that they must leave tonight, not caring if the boat fare was a bit higher; Ming'er's father also thought so, so Mr. Li had to agree. At that time, their luggage was also being transported by small boat. So they carried the luggage on board, which took quite a while.</p>
<p>The boatman walked in, panting, and said, "The big boat has approached, you can go take a look." So Ming'er followed his father towards the riverbank.</p>
<p>That night, there was a crescent moon and a few twinkling stars dotted the sky. They walked along the uneven stone path, gradually stepping on the soft sand. The tide had receded. Ming'er saw a large boat moored in the distance on the beach. A narrow gangplank rested on both ends, it was almost several dozen steps long. Ming'er said with a very frightened tone, "How can we walk on this narrow plank? What if we lose our footing and fall into the water?" He cautiously followed his father onto the plank, seeing the water under the plank surging as if welcoming him to go down, he mustered his courage and walked over, and didn't feel much. But his heart was still pounding a bit.</p>
<p>The boat was very large, and the inside was quite clean. There were four bunks on both sides of the boat. They only took a look at them and hurriedly returned to the transit house.</p>
<p>At that time, Ming'er's younger siblings were lying on benches, asleep, and their mother was also a bit tired. She saw them come in and asked, "Are we getting on the boat tonight? It's already past twelve o'clock." "Yes, let's load the luggage onto the boat first," the father replied. He told Ming'er to go out and count the number of luggage pieces, so Ming'er took a flashlight and ran out. "Hey, little brother, you can't shine the flashlight towards the sky, or you'll be arrested," the person in the transit house warned him. He then realized that when planes came, the traitors would send signals as targets for bombing. Shining the flashlight towards the sky would make one suspected of being a traitor.</p>
<p>After a busy time of moving luggage, they helped the old and the young onto the boat. How could the timid children and the old lady walk on such a narrow gangplank? Ming'er first prepared a rope and told the timid ones to hold onto his rope, taking small steps one by one. At that time, Ming'er's mother was holding a sleeping younger brother, holding the younger sister's hand, and she was also timid, so Ming'er pulled in front, feeling his mother's hand was cold. His father pushed from behind, and with great difficulty, they got on the boat. The mother's heart was beating nervously. She even said, "This kind of fright is a first in my life." Later, they all got on the boat.</p>
<p>It was very crowded with more than twenty people on one boat. Before long, the boat gradually moved, and so, in the silent starlit night, they quietly bid farewell to beloved Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Kicking Shuttlecock</h3>
<p>— Wei Hua</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Ci Kai introduced rope skipping to everyone; today I am here to introduce another sport to everyone, which is kicking shuttlecock.</p>
<p>Have children read such a lesson in books?</p>
<p>Willows grow, fly kites;</p>
<p>Willows die, kick shuttlecocks;</p>
<p>Willows bend, roll iron hoops;</p>
<p>Willows sway, spin tops!</p>
<p>Among them, flying kites is purely a game. Although it can take in some fresh air, it is still limited by the weather: only spring is suitable for flying kites, and rainy days must be excluded. Moreover, at this time, Shanghai is surrounded by murderous robbers. Even if we want to go to the countryside to fly kites, I am afraid it is impossible!</p>
<p>Let’s talk about rolling iron hoops! Although rolling iron hoops can make us run and jump, which is a good exercise, it also requires a large sports field. In a small house, the iron hoop will hit the wall before it rolls for a while, which is really frustrating. At the same time, the price of iron hoops is very expensive, which is not cost-effective.</p>
<p>Third, let’s talk about spinning tops. Spinning tops is a dull game. People stand in a fixed place and cannot run or jump; at the same time, the left hand cannot move, only the right hand moves. If you bend your waist for a long time, it will hurt.</p>
<p>Only kicking shuttlecock is the best sport. It can develop the muscles of all parts of the body and can also exercise our eyesight. It does not require a large sports venue and does not cost much money. Spring, summer, autumn and winter, sunny or rainy, indoors or outdoors, it can be done anytime and anywhere. It is really an excellent game and sport!</p>
<p>A few years ago, the National Games had a shuttlecock kicking performance, which shows that most athletes and politicians have noticed the benefits of kicking shuttlecock, so they have vigorously promoted it.</p>
<p>Children, you might as well try it: see if it is interesting? Is it beneficial to your body? You only need a copper coin with a hole, a small piece of cloth, and a string to make a shuttlecock. If you can use chicken feathers instead of cloth, it will be more beautiful.</p>
<p>Children's Small Garden</p>
<h3>Plum Blossom</h3>
<p>— Ma Yuanyong, Sixth Grade Student, Zhendong Elementary School</p>
<p>Now, Spring Girl has come gracefully wearing bright and dazzling clouds, and the plum blossoms by the corner of the fence, comforted by Spring Girl, have also begun to bloom beautifully.</p>
<p>In previous years, I would go with my father to Dengwei in Suzhou and Meiyuan in Wuxi to admire the plum blossoms. However, how long ago was it that my father sacrificed himself for the country in the August 13th Songhu Battle two years ago? And my hometown of Wuxi, with its beautiful mountains and rivers, was also ravaged by iron hooves. However, I still miss the plum blossoms in Meiyuan in my hometown. I wonder if they are safe? I still love plum blossoms with many meanings, especially the plum blossoms in my hometown.</p>
<p>I do not love his perfect color and fragrance, but only love his superb character. If people can learn from plum blossoms, have real knowledge, not admire vanity, have pride but no arrogance, and can fight against the harsh winter, severe snow, strong winds and storms, that is the greatness of plum blossoms. No wonder the Chinese people unanimously respect and honor him as the national flower.</p>
<p>Children, since we are the pillars of the country's future, we must have the same character as plum blossoms. Let's work hard!</p>
<h3>Parting</h3>
<p>— Chen Jinshan, Fifth Grade Student, Jiangxi Affiliated Elementary School</p>
<p>Goodbye, my hometown, my beloved hometown.</p>
<p>When I walked out of the entrance of this village, I only felt that there was nothing I could bear to leave behind. As I gradually walked away, I only saw many relatives and friends waving red and white handkerchiefs, like national flags waving in the wind.</p>
<p>Goodbye! Goodbye! The sound of firecrackers crackling in my ears, comrades shouted goodbye to me, friends, final victory must belong to me.</p>
<p>My eyes were wet, and I knew tears filled my face. At this time, there was an unspeakable feeling of emotion, neat footsteps, walking forward, "The final victory must belong to me," I imprinted deeply in my mind.</p>
<p>On both sides of the avenue were yellow soil and scorched grass. Past a few mountains, the sun was just showing a head as if sending us off, emitting thousands of rays of light, shining on the waves in the stream, jumping non-stop like naughty children, shining a sparkling golden light.</p>
<p>Goodbye, my hometown, my beloved hometown, I can't bear to leave my hometown. But I can't bear to give up the work that everyone should do in this great era. I also look forward to many beloved warriors, who are building a new China with their blood; if I don't take on some responsibilities, I am a sinner.</p>
<p>I will always be a support for the loyal and brave soldiers, and dedicate my body and blood to my country. This is my oath.</p>
<h3>My Saving Method</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhiming, Fifth Grade Student, Minzhi Elementary School</p>
<p>Money is a kind of evil thing, but most people in the universe rely on it to survive. Especially in this extraordinary period, countless people have lost their homes and families and have no way to earn money. Therefore, the refugee shelters on the isolated island are very crowded, and they are extremely short of the necessities of clothing, food, and life. This matter must have a large amount of money to solve. If you want to raise huge sums of money to help them, you must save money to succeed.</p>
<p>Now I am in the era of consumption, and of course I cannot have a huge amount of savings. Fortunately, saving money is a way to accumulate small amounts into large amounts, and it is not limited to how much. Although I can only get a small amount of money from my parents, I can still save some from my pocket money every day and use it for savings. My saving method is to adopt the method of zero deposit and lump-sum payment in the bank, dividing three months into one term, saving one dollar of silver per term, and depositing it in the bank. I will definitely increase the amount of savings to a considerable period of time. Isn't there more capital?</p>
<p>Friends! Isn't this method easy? If you save one cent a day, you will have nine jiao in three months. In this way, you can save a lot of money. If it is large, you can donate it to the country, and if it is small, you can help refugees. Isn't this a good way? I think the children will always agree and everyone will be willing to implement it!</p>
<h3>Dear Children:</h3>
<p>— Shi Guangyuan bows on February 24th</p>
<p>You must have had a very happy New Year! You must have many candies! Please don't throw away the candies you can't eat on the ground. Have you read the newspaper today? The newspaper said that tens of thousands of children can't even get enough to eat, and they don't have enough warm clothes to wear. They didn't even eat a piece of candy during the New Year! Please share some of the candies you can't eat with them! You got so much lucky money during the New Year, what are you going to use it for? Your parents have money to buy you the things you need, please quickly take out the lucky money you received and buy clothes, rice and school supplies for the suffering children! Let them live the same life as us. Dear children! Please donate quickly! I wish you happiness</p>
<h3>Snow White (9)</h3>
<p>— Tian Sun</p>
<p>Happy replied loudly, "He himself doesn't know what's going on, he's never even tried it!"</p>
<p>All of this went too smoothly, which made Old Stubborn very dissatisfied and always wanted to find something to complain about. So he crossed his arms in front of his chest and coughed very loudly, attracting everyone's attention.</p>
<p>He said angrily, "This is not the time to play charades, don't you all be so verbose! We already know who we are, but we should also ask: who is she?"</p>
<p>Snow White almost laughed at his angry look, but she tried her best to hold it back and said very solemnly, "I think we should start over, as if we were meeting for the first time. How do you do, gentlemen? My name is Snow White."</p>
<p>"Snow White?"</p>
<p>"Could it be Snow White?"</p>
<p>Snow White replied "Yes" and then told them everything that had happened that day. After the hunter sent her away, she ran blindly in the forest, how scared she was. Later, how she met the birds and beasts and those small animals, who led her to this house.</p>
<p>But when Snow White mentioned the queen, the seven dwarfs unconsciously swallowed, and fourteen feet trembled in those seven pairs of old, worn boots, because they had long heard what a cruel woman the queen was. It is said that she is also a cunning witch who can do anything.</p>
<p>Finally, Old Stubborn represented them and expressed their fears, warning his companions, "We better drive this girl away, don't let her stay here. Remember my words, if the queen knows she's here, she'll come and kill us seven one by one, we'll all be doomed."</p>
<p>Snow White hurriedly defended herself, "But she doesn't know where I am, she will never come here to find me."</p>
<p>Old Stubborn hissed softly, "Hmph, she won't come here to find you? She knows everything, no one can hide it from her! And she also has the magic of invisibility, making people unable to see her body! Maybe she's hiding in this room right now!"</p>
<p>The dwarfs were really surprised to hear Old Stubborn's words, trembling one by one, and widening their eyes to look around the dark bedroom, as if the queen was really hiding in the four corners of the room.</p>
<p>Doctor said firmly, "I say she should stay here!"</p>
<p>Old Stubborn roared, "I say she has to leave here!"</p>
<p>They both showed a firm look, unwilling to give in to each other, and almost pulled out their fists to fight each other.</p>
<p>Snow White felt very sorry to see this and hurriedly begged from the side, "Please don't argue for my sake, and hurt each other's feelings, I will leave here immediately." As she spoke, she moved her body and walked towards the door, saying with worry and regret, "I am too foolish, but I thought there might be something I could help with if I stayed here. I thought you would definitely need me. If I stayed here, I could manage the house for you, wash things, sew clothes, cook food..."</p>
