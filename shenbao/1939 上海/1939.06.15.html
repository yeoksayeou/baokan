<p>王外長昨發表談話</p>
<p>（重慶）外長王寵惠今日晤見路透訪員時、對於日人封鎖天津外國租界事、發表談話如下、日人封鎖天津外國租界、扣留英國在華武官史比亞、殺害英僑丁格勒、及煽惑反英舉動、其眞意所在、係在試探其所宣佈奪取所有外國租界及居留地之政策、究能推行至若何程度、日本對於其、反共公約各同盟國家之權益、甚且尙不予以尊重、倘使竟能藉豪奪之手段、而達到其目的、允其對外國利益作連續不斷之侵犯、則各國在日人所轄各區域內之未來地位、必將黑暗、還東之侵略者、首侵中國、今又侵及第三國家、如有以爲滿足日人之要求、即可解决此種侵略所造成之局勢者、殊爲錯誤之見解、因此侵略者不過靜候適當時機、以完全關閉「開放之門戶」並將一切西文勢力、驅出亞洲而已、王氏結論云、如各國能集體停止購買日貨、並禁止對日本之一切接擠、而不任命彼等之利益權利、橫遭蹂躪、則日本之恫嚇卽能予以消滅云（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（重慶）此間聯合日報、今日著論批評天、局勢、促請英法當局對於目前天津之局勢、採取堅强態度而予日方以警吿、並請英法當局一方面速與美國商討採取有效之聯合行動、一方面加速英法蘇三國合作抵抗侵略之談判云、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>封鎖惡例不容存在</p>
<p>（巴黎）中國天津市局勢、頃由此閒各報加以評論、右派斐伽羅報登有駐倫敦訪員來電稱「天津英租界共有中外居民數萬人、此决被日軍封鎖、足爲惡例之濫觴、此後日軍當局、有例可援、或將進一步而用同樣方法、將中國各港口之仍有外國租界者、完全加以封鎖、亦未可必、英國政府決定採取堅强態度、以謀對付、其故即在於是、此在法國、在天津市所保有之利益、實與英國同其重要彼此兩國政府、爰乃保持密切接觸、並已在原則上决定采取聯合行動」、右派時代報載稱「天津市日軍封鎖英租界所構成之威脅、實乃日本與西方各國從事鬥爭之一幕、日軍發言人曾謂津市現行糾紛、即使覓　解決辦法、英日陸誼、亦未必能因以恢復、此言殊可注意、揆度日本之意、殆欲英法兩國拒不援助中國、曁在中國境內廢止租界制度、此外、日本雖未加入德義同盟條的、但德義兩國凡有所發動、日本均儘力予以贊助、則謂此决之事乃係德義軸心所授意、亦無不可也」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日各報皆以天津之封鎖爲主要新聞皆標題皆用大字、附以地圖、並載日方屢决侵犯華北英國利益之詳情、聞天津日軍事當局已拒絕英國所提出由共同委員會角決天津爭案之建議、路透社探悉日政府答覆英政府之牒文、取此案乃地方性質、應就地解決之態度、又悉英政府現正密切考慮所將續取之步驟、官方對於所將取之對付手段、現守緘默、惟曾切實聲明、日方之封鎖、實不可恕英政府毫無馴然屈服之意、英法兩政府刻正進行協商、此閒現信法政府對於英政府所認爲必要之任何計劃定將予以贊助、路透社探悉美政府巳命天津美總領事任英國所提議之共同委員會之主席並命竭力斡旋、覔取解決英日爭案之解決方法、遠東事務某權威今日向往訪之路透社記者聲稱、「吾人於此引渡日方所索四華人問題、現純守道德的原則、此種舉動必能引起華人對英人之好感、日人則望使英人與華人同失面子、此舉且似可使美人具良好之印象」云、又據負責方面聲稱、日方顯欲藉口拒絕引渡華人問題、實行共侵略計劃、其目的乃在使日人得於經濟上金融上控制天津外國貿易、至日方所稱之新秩序」、迄今僅證明有害於英國之權益、故諸外人之願依現有條約與中國自由貿易者皆不予以歡迎、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>英報猶冀外交解決</p>

<p>自昨晨六時起，天津日軍已將英法租界實行封鎖。這種的封鎖，完全是一種脅迫侮辱的行爲，自然談不到什麽法理的根據。封鎖的影響所及，以天津英法租界爲根據的一切工商業，都將完全停頓；租界內中外居民的生活，也將蒙受極大的痛苦。這是中日戰爭以來，日本公然對歐美各國在華權益猛烈攻擊的又一章。</p>
<p>日本這次封鎖天津英法租界，係藉口英方拒絕日本引渡剌程案中四嫌疑犯的要求；而日昨天津日軍發言人又聲稱：即使英方交出刺程四嫌疑犯，也不能解決這一問題；除非英租界當局和日方合作，共同樹立「東亞的新秩序」，放棄一切援助中國政府的政策。因此之故，英方提出的妥協辦法，即組織混合委員會，共同討論引渡問題，也已被日方拒絕了。</p>
<p>分析日本這次封鎖天津租界一事，有兩點特別値得注意：第一天津英法租界的封鎖，只是日本企圖解決中國租界問題的外科手術的一部分；將來其他各地的租界，也都有遭受同樣命運的可能。這種推論是有根據的，（一）天津日軍發言人昨天的聲明；（二）日前柬京都新聞曾宣傳日本眞正的仇敵，不在中國，而在中國境內的租界；（三）據日昨所謂日本興昱院政務部長鈴木的談話，謂在日本建設「新秩序」之下，各國應將在華租界交還；現租界妨礙新秩序的建設，實爲日本斷難容許的敵對行爲。這三種方面不同的表示很顯明的表示了日本對各地租界的意態，和掠爲己有的決心。現在天津的英法租界固已遭受日本的封鎖；而前日英國會討論遠東問題時，曾把今年七月七日視爲上海租界最危險的日期；同時本埠方面，又傳日本當局已訓令租界內日本僑民移居蘇州河北。我們雖不能想像上海竟有一日，陷於天津同樣的局勢，但至少可以斷言視租界爲金湯，爲樂土，這是錯誤的。</p>
<p>其次近來日本國內和日軍控制下的中國游擊區域內，普遍的發生了反英運動；並且各地對於英國官民的殘害侮辱案件，更是疊出不窮；這次日軍封鎖天津英法租界，好像也是專一對付英國，所以事先天津日領曾向其他各國駐津領館要求諒解，並表示封鎖後美國僑民所需要的食糧。可由日方供給。日本這種行動無疑的是一種離間手段。日本要完成她的新秩序，她必須先行排斥英國在遠東的權益，然後排斥美法等國在遠東的權益；現在日本在天津單祗向英國方面進攻，絕不是放棄排斥其他各國在遠東權益的企圖，乃是恐怕英法美三國的合作。只好暫行把反美反法的工作作爲排斥在華歐美權益的第二或第三個程序罷了。</p>
<p>日本這種的野心和用意，歐美各國又何嘗不深切洞悉，只是到現在尙未切實的對付。尤以身當其衝的英國。根據過去的經騐，當知這次天津事件，除非英國願意退出遠東，絕非委曲求全所能解決；倘仍以爲這次事件還是由於刺程四嫌疑犯的引渡問題，自是極大的錯誤。英外相日前演說，尙稱決不承認片面變更遠東各項條的，將以全力保衛英國在華權益；若想藉引渡嫌疑犯而解決這個問題，便無異於親手撕破遠東各項條的，自已斷送在華的權益。要知對於侵略者的行動，祗有以行動來制止。才是最有效的辦法，鼓浪嶼事件就是一個例證。據日昨巴黎及華盛頓的電訉，法美政府都已聲明各該國在遠東的海軍與英國合作共同保護在遠東的權益。天津租界的事件，或者就是促令英美各國以行動保衛利權最適當的時機吧！</p>

<h3>證劵　外股倐落　公債小挫</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、因漲勢過高、略起回風惟多方叫仍在拉抬、有一部分多頭稍有出籠、其實大戶多頭過於擁擠、稍稍放出、亦以洋拆過吃款已不合算、且外滙套利有月息分半、故資本家又舍此而取彼、惟市塲人氣已有轉變、觀收盤時其他各種均小、獨丙種未動、即以多方抬價之情形也、昨日經過、開盤行市即稍軟、全塲賣氣較濃、十三及四十二號聯和天生永康大通均有賣出、買方氣勢較餒、興元同順同康等號進胃幷不踴躍、二十號則稍有出脫、引起人心之恍惚、午後仍未見振作、四十二號及聯和繼續賣出、永康裕源及松茂亦均有脫手、買戶大都爲散戶補空及多方托價、市氣較萎、收盤亦早、比之上午、除丙種未動外、餘續小一角左右、市價結果路爲回小四角半至六角半、成交總數的計一百萬元以上、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中國國貨公司股票五十股、價爲二十三元五角、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市開盤、賣氣甚活、似爲日本封鎖天津英法租界之緊張空氣、成交價格運續降低惟入後至收盤時、情形似有回風、數項股票亦略有進展、恰和股似最受打擊、開盤廿一元八角、有少數成交、此後直降至廿元零九角、該價吸胃甚暢、收盤行市、買價爲廿一元二角、及賣價爲廿一元三角、電車股甚穩定、全晨價爲四十四元、收盤賣價亦爲此價、會德　股自成交卅九元二角五分以後、降落至册八元半、成交尙豐、橡皮股市亦受人心不定之影響、起初價格稍形低落、但至後吸胃尙佳、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉價步高升　已達四元八角　麥市見暗緊</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉市况、步見昻騰、蓋日上週四開始提漲以來、雖無猛烈之奔騰、開價上漲、似無止境、廠方允認爲漲勢未足不肯大量脫手、市上浮存之少數回籠貨、亦被囤戶所吸收、致市面逐見鋒俏、昨聞高牌洋粉喊價仍須五元、而普通牌子售開四元七角半、比前亦加五分、二號粉廠盤、本客一律漲至四元八角滙劃、但成交不暢、因客囤進胃雖佳、而廠方供給仍有限制亦爲鄭重之計也、麵粉今日有一萬二千包、運往天津塘沽、又二千五百包、運汕頭、</p>
<p>小麥　昨新小麥來源、略有運到、均係滬寗路一帶之貨、聞常熟新麥亦有零星抵埠、本年因天氣較旱、麥身乾燥、値此洋麥價貴、人心看高之際、隨引起一般囤戶所注意、聞有暗中收買者甚多、致市面暗緊、惟華廠需要仍寂日商進胃亦懈、故正式交易、依然牛穩、昨有本街績辦崑山新麥六十五包、價仍爲六元〇八分云、</p>
<p>囤戶活躍　米價續漲半元</p>
<p>杜粳　昨各帮來源河下共到南港一二號，車輪句子同崑等帮三千餘包、本街及囤戶胃口、因天時晴旱、心思續佳、行家辦胃仍健故市情又見熱閙、各貨迭開高價、若常高粳做開十九元四角、又較前市提升四五角僅蘇同粳以身骨較弱、尙差一元有奇、然亦較升四角出零、薄稻前開十八元者、昨已開出十八元半、</p>
<p>客秈　自蕪湖報漲後、連日到頭漸减、每日自五六千包减至二三千包後首夾源减少因此貨方心思更爲向上、昨內地帮辦胃已淡、本街店化亦懈、惟囤戶反爲食辦、故成交仍有六千五六百包、價則漲起四五六角不等、南京秈開十六元半、蕪湖高秈亦須十六元二三角、至杜洋尖埠尖、亦跟粳市並提三四角不等、</p>
<p>洋米　存貨尙有八九千包、但均在行囤手中、因連日米價飛升、乃均堅守不脫、西貢前日開到廿元〇四角後、當晚即有廿元〇六七角之討價、昨貨主竟討價至廿一元角、以致求克妥交、</p>
<p>糯米　現銷粢飯抯稍有動辦，其他不甚暢爽、昨市高白兀開二十一元二角至二十元、變元相仿較好三四角、</p>
<h3>糖市　國糖成交略增</h3>
<p>昨糖市依然堅穩、據嗬囒電訊、七八月份爲囒盾九·〇〇、九十月份八·二〇、又倫敦電、近遠期均微小二五、八月份六先令十辦士、十二月份六先令〇二五、明年三月份六先令、本市公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧二十九元三角、成交八千包、轉口貨二十一元、五百包、老貨小一角、亦成交三百包、路貨二十一元二角、五百包、太古車白略緊、B嘜二十九元、三百包、二十八元九角、二百包、CW嘍二十八元八角、CX嘜二十八元半DY嘜二十七元半、HX嘜二十七元三角、H嘜車赤十九元、轉口嗬赤略降以十三元半成交一百包、國糖成交轉增、價亦稍漲、計開出雜路洋九十包、十七兀九角特提靑五十包、十六元、冲提靑二百包、十五元四五角、正綿赤十六元二角半、次之十六元、計百數十包、片靑呌十一元未成、惟聞暗盤成交三百包、價較小未詳、</p>
<h3>煤炭　印度煤續漲</h3>
<p>印度烟煤、自滙市變動以來、羅比票價猛升、成本攸關、喊上四元盤子、日昨市塲求過於供、貨主板俏、暗盤續高兩元、同業拆價、印度篩塊每噸四十六元、亦祗許五噸十噸、躉批不供、故門莊店水漲船高、不得不略爲增加、每大雜售洋六元云、</p>

<h3>紗花　金價回跌　棉紗買戶束手　二十支雙馬下跌十元</h3>
<p>連朝飛騰之紗市、今則反動下挫、市塲流言漸熄、外匯始終穩靜、掛在六辦士半、所有虛浮之言、不攻自破矣、黃金亦回軟、同時實銷依然沉悶不暢、市盤即吿下落、惟同業某豐紗號之多額各牌棉紗、手中常囤三四千包爲基礎籌碼、每日在市逢漲吐出、遇跌則拖進、一般散戶因自匯票改縮以來、橫跳七十餘元、有一部份認爲滿足、業巳出檔、但大多數認爲大漲小回頭、前途仍有漲風隱伏也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因大宗在多頭地位、目個個人手中揑幾包貨、加之近來銀行家在現貨市塲大活動、於是人心良好、大家心目中買了貨物皆値錢可高枕無憂、因之遂成爲易漲難跌之勞、開價勿動、二十支雙馬外棧貨價爲四百九十八元、棧單爲四百八十七元、少頃形勢平疲、賣戶稍盛、謂外滙帶硬、而金價下跌、買戶束手一步、徐徐下降、一霎間現貨雙馬跌去十二元、做至四百八十六元、棧單價爲四百八十一元、旋以多方略爲收進幾包、又復回升、迨至收盤二十支雙馬現貨價爲四百八十九元、棧單價爲四百八十四元、午後開盤聞日紗忽跌五元、雙馬棧單價四百七十九元、現貨亦做四百八十六七元、繼以某豐紗號又有收進幾包、頓見回好、氣勢轉緊、迨至收盤、雙馬棧單價爲四百八十四元、現貨價爲四百八十八元、結果各帮買去統計二千〇三十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十元、五福跌八元、牧羊跌十二元、特金城跌二十七元、雙地球跌十一元、今日棉紗六百四十五件、運往香港、又六百九十件、運往汕頭、又一百件、運往海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行一、四二五香港　四一五</p>
<p>內地　七五汕頭　九五</p>
<p>湖南　二〇統計二、〇三〇</p>
<p>日紗反動續跌、茲據市場言、逐步狂騰後、實需始終不動、而報載有七七日軍奪滬租界、於是多頭又起不安之心、遂慘落十元、破四百元關、月琴紗本月價爲三百九十八元</p>
<p>棉行雖無交易　同業異常繁榮</p>
<p>美印棉成交三千餘包</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約昨因美農部所討論之農業發款案、未能決議、殊使棉市猶豫不前、但後因產區雨水過多、影響棉產殊烈、及政府貸款棉放出無期、布疋交易日見進步、而市上現貨日緊、因之棉價上漲、結果又漲七八磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比、埃及漲三五磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、洋行雖未定開、然同業交易異常繁榮、昨日各同業互相成交之印美棉其達三千餘包、日來日廠方面到貨甚擠、前因外滙未結、無法付款、故遲緩已有多日、茲經多方設法、業巳於黑市結得一部外匯、前到之貨現正進行完稅中、故預料日廠之與花號購貨、暫時可稀淡矣、</p>
<p>本棉生意殊稀、惟同業中交易異常熱鬧、此項現貨、大都輾轉售於日廠、係紡三三支及二十支以上之原料、火機花身骨較優勝之貨、售價殊昂、但廠方因外匯關係、未曾動辦、交易停滯、蘇北來源、計到下沙花四百九十七包、又寗波來棉花一千九百五十八件、北沙來一百七十件、茲將現棉情形如左、</p>
<h3>油餅　傳大連開禁　豆油跌價　生油始終軟化</h3>
<p>豆油　前因來源不多、人心緊張、操縱家絕好機會、致行情有直追四月二十四日最高紀錄之勢、至昨日上午、各油價均繼續劇提一元外、計開膠州油二百件、價爲三十三元、烟歧油一百件、價爲三十四元、靑岐油一百件、價爲三十三元五角、天津聽裝油五百聽、價爲四十四元三角、惟大連油須漲一元八角、爲四十六元八角、成交二十桶、又神戶來述油妥一百桶、價爲叫十六元三角、詎午後突傳大連油山偽方負責販運、有實行開禁之說、故浮囤亟出、市氣頓轉下游、神戶來述油首先甩價自四十五元五角、猛挫至四十四元五角、成交一百餘桶、比上日之最高價、反小四角、以致其他各油、因之未能繼續做開、</p>
<p>生油　晨初開盤、即呈不穩局面、蓋因山東帮號客兜拋路貨膠州油殷切、故市氣始終軟化、結果做開見貨膠州油五百件、價爲三十四元、比前市回跌五角、路貨共妥成一千餘件、上午價爲三十三元五角、午後在豆油不良之空氣下、挫跌五角、價三十三元、查生油出口今日有四百五十件又四千五百九十聽運往香港</p>
<p>豆餅依然踴騰</p>
<p>昨日豆餅市價不論期現各餅、均跳出三元關外、其踊騰之烈熖、依然未戢、市塲中流動籌碼、在一般有力囤戶之壁壘中、故近日汕頭帮採辦大連雜牌餅以來、其市氣之熱烈、更屬炙手、昨源記現餅行情自三元零五分、頻升至三元一角四分、成交四千片、雜牌爲三元零五分至三元一角、妥交三萬餘片、六月份源記七千片、價爲三元一角至三元二角、雜牌二千片、價爲三元一角至一角一分、其他汕帮辦去江北小豆餅五千片、價爲五角七分半、比較前開之價、亦漲起二分餘、又採去烟台光邊餅三千片、價爲三元二角、</p>
<p>豆子出口、（十三日）有八十二噸、運往哥倫布、又三十一噸、運往孟買、今日亦有二千四百三十包、運往香港、又三百五十包、運往汕四、</p>

<p>東疋</p>

<p>德平被扣　已獲諒解</p>
<p>關於滬甬航綫、自經甬當局於三月五日命令封鎖後、所有前經核准各輪、均一律禁阻出入、交通斷絕、爲時月餘、旋經各方一再請求、當局爲疏通貨運、經權宜變通准予特許之輪隻、裝運必需品入口、惟絕對禁止搭客、故各輪復航、仍係</p>
<p>臨時性質、而非正式恢復、本月初、甬方盛傳滬甬綫將於十五日起、正式恢復、但延至昨日下午六時止、本市航業界迄未接奉上項命令、故正式復航之期、尙須有待、又意商中意輪船公司之德平輪、因本月三日泊甬時、適遭</p>
<p>日機空襲</p>
<p>致未及受軍警當局之險查即行啟椗駛滬、被甬當局認爲違反命令、故該輪於九日晨再度駛甬、即遭扣留、茲經公司方面向甬防守司令部解釋後</p>

<h3>天津租界被封鎖　外輸儎貨退關　本埠英商輪船公司昨接津電　水道亦遭阻斷船隻恐難靠岸</h3>
<p>天津英法兩租界、昨晨起被日軍實行封鎖、交通隔絕、聞水道亦被阻斷、形勢非常嚴重、本市各界、異常關心、航業界更爲關切、昨晨本市兩英商輪船公司、已接津分行電吿、關於被封鎖後之情形、據稱水道亦遭阻斷、來津船隻、恐不能傍靠租界內之碼頭、來貨請勿裝儎等情、各公司接電後巳照辦、觀上述各公司津行來電情形、足證天津租界形勢、嚴重之程度、太古公司最近二日適無船赴津、須至十七日始有盛京號開往、屆時如何變化、現尙不能預卜、怡和洋行今日有定生號、於下午一時出口、經靑島·威海衛·烟台而赴天津、事前承裝之天津貨、昨已一律退關、惟至塘沽之貨、及麵粉一萬餘包、照常運去、該行原定十七日亦有永生新輪、開往天津、</p>
<h3>綸昌勞資雙方　靜候合理解決　廠方不承認僞組織　絕無委託調處之事</h3>
<p>浦東英商綸昌染織廠勞資糾紛、因僞方之惡意鼓動、企圖激成反英運動、並以武力阻撓工人進廠復工、遂致無法解決、自該廠英職員丁格勒被日軍刺傷殞命後、該項工潮、更演變爲外交問題、致工潮本身、益陷僵持局面、全體良善工人、在僞罷工委員會」與所謂「工人同盟會」威嚇壓迫之下、已失去其自由、均切盼能獲早日進廠、現悉該案廠方正靜候英政府交涉、以求合理解決、乃僞方日前忽散放謠言、稱該廠經理辛克勒已向日方要求調處並由日方介紹與「市政府當局」會見等語、據記者向勞方探詢、該項消息、完全不確、廠方對於僞組織始終不予承認、故絕無委託斡旋之事、僞方散佈此項謠言、顯在意圖毛遂自薦、（大光社）</p>
<p>日方報紙　故事渲染</p>
<p>大陸報云、日方統制之新申報、昨（十三日）以顯著地位刊一消息稱、浦東綸昌紡織廠人員、由董事辛克萊率領、於六月九日往訪日陸戰隊司令部、要求日方襄助解決綸昌廠中罷工僵局、當同意報吿「上海市府」仲裁此事云、記者叩諸綸昌公司人員、彼等仍守緘默、謂月前對此局勢不能發一言、按罷工者與公司方面已於六月二日解決罷工風潮、然據可靠消息、六月五日工人擬入廠時、遭僞政權爪牙所阻、「新申報」消息又稱、日陸戰隊長經綸昌人員要求、乃於六月十一日晨偕辛克萊等訪僞「市府社會事務局長」周某、周允竭力使罷工事件和平解決、僞員鑒於綸昌公司此决「改變態度」、而與「上海市府」接觸、頗爲重視、</p>
<p>丁格勒案　尚未解決</p>

<p>前門出入</p>
<p>李等於上月十七日遷入、僱用傭婦一人、料理瑣事、據李云、彼在白爾路亞蒙大戲院隔壁二六七·二六九號雙間門面開設滙和糖菓公司、故晨出晚歸、習以爲常、昨晨八點一刻、李夫婦</p>
<p>方在起身</p>
<p>傭婦赴小菜塲購買菜蔬回來、正在天井中洗滌而李正擬整衣出外之際、突有暴徒兩人、推開大門入內、不問情由、即出手槍、對準李天柱·李許元珍·夫婦運開四響、李之面頰與胸前、各擊中一彈、李許元珍右乳上面血海部與小腹、亦各中一彈、兩人</p>
<p>同時倒地</p>
<p>兇手見目的已達、即返身揚長逸去、時李之傭婦正在天井中洗菜、驟間槍聲、驚駭不敢仰視、未看淸行兇者之面貌服色、而樓上房客與二房東、亦均未注意、迨兇手去後、該傭婦驚魂始定、見主人主婦皆倒臥地板上、鮮血由創口</p>
<p>汩汩流出</p>
<p>即奔弄外報吿崗捕、一轉報吿法捕房、立派中西探馳往調查、見李妻許元珍巳氣絕身死、李奄奄一息、立召救護車將李急送廣慈醫院醫治、聞傷勢甚重、恐有性命之險、一面將許元珍尸體體舁送台拉斯脫路工部局醫院附設騐尸所、候今日報謂特二法院</p>
<p>派員檢驗</p>
<p>至李夫婦之被殺原因、正由捕房着手檢查中、一面由警務處傳諭通班各探、一體嚴緝在逃兇犯、務獲解究、同時法警務處更飭派大批中西探捕計四十餘人於八時五十分馳住該處肇事附近之法國公園嚴密搜查、先將辣斐德路華龍路之公園大門、及莫利愛路之邊門、予關閉</p>
<p>禁阻游客</p>

<p>鋼絲馬甲</p>
<p>但渠穿此保護服、似頗不適、大使之馬甲、能禦高速率毛瑟槍彈、左右保護之西探則穿較輕便之各式馬甲、咋日又開供大使應用之避彈汽車一輛、刻在本埠製造中、惟此說未能證實、衆信該車使用時、隨同保護之大比</p>
<p>警務人員</p>
<p>將大爲减少、至大使館及其邸內仍將留駐數額不變之軍警、昨日未得官方消息、聞大使生命未受直接威脅、亦未發生恫嚇情事、惟當局曾得有人正計劃圖謀大使生命之情報、記者昨日叩諸警務界、彼等除證實巳取戒備外、未發他言、又大陸報云、昨（十三日）　消息靈通方面聲稱、自星期六日午後所取保護駐華英大使寇爾爵士生命安全之</p>
<p>特殊戒備</p>
<p>將繼續數星期、或更久而不輟、關於對英大使之威脅、或竟係陰謀之消息、昨仍嚴守秘密、不能探悉詳情、惟　消息靈通方面聲稱、在華日陸海軍當局間之有增無巳的强暴、與確保大使安全而取之戒備、有若干關係、昨晚自可靠方面探悉、昨日侵晨英大使惇信路邸中曾聞近郊有</p>
<p>沉重槍聲</p>
<p>惟距離甚遙、此事旣發生於日軍控制區內、公共租界警務處乃不加調查、聞事因匪徒圖刦某華商工廠、與「大道」警察開槍互轟、</p>
<p>松江航班　暫開葉榭爲止</p>
<p>由租界至閔行葉榭航班、自展至松江、沿途經過新埭氽來廟均停靠搭客、據內河航業界消息、十二日由滬開往航班、駛至新埭附近、被阻退回、因賅處情形混亂、連日有戰事發生、現開往新埭氽來廟松江航班、以葉榭爲終點、對往來乘客、檢查仍嚴、</p>

<p>日企圖獨覇中國航業、封鎖沿海各口岸、阻撓第三國船隻行駛、並拒絕開放長江、由大連·日淸·等公司獨航、並登報招攬顧客、英輪復航、難成事實、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>日方拒絕　開放長江</p>
<p>滬漢航綫自上海至漢口、經過南通·江陰·口岸·鎭江·南京·蕪湖大通·安慶·華陽·九江，武穴·蔪春。黃石港·黃州等處、戰前行駛之船隻爲英商太古·怡和、國營招商局、民營三北。寗紹、日商日淸等、自漢口淪陷後、中國籍船隻、被迫完全停航、外商綸船、因日方藉口軍事關係、拒絕行駛長江、雖經英方提出交涉、要求迅予開放長江、終爲日方所拒絕、上月底怡和之瑞和輪及太古之武穴輪、由滬駛漢、係裝載英國海軍調防、不能認爲英國商輪之復航、</p>

<p>該華人　感恐懼、突變其心自窗中躍出、越外灘而循南京路西奔、三日兵亟追之該華人奔逃時、手携一包，某外人方駕汽車西駛、見狀以爲該華人刦包　逸、乃驅車駛入汽油站之車行道中、堵塞人行道、該華人　被追逐者所擒獲、是時値　　川路南京路口之</p>

<h3>淪陷區域　銅幣亦感缺乏　外傳有另發三分輔幣券之說　商民代幣改用印花有禆國庫</h3>
<p>新新社記者曾以缺乏銅之補救辦法、叩詢金融界某鉅子、據談、現在各商店公共汽車電車公司等、因銅允缺乏、各自籌發代價券、此乃臨時補救辦法、照目下情形而論、欲求永久之消除此種恐慌、惟有（一）運輸大量銅鎳幣釆滬供給市面流通、（二）發行一分二分五分輔幣券、前者因運輸恐遇困難、且運滬後仍有被吸收之慮、故後者之發行分券、實爲最佳之補救辦法、據聞財部對於此項建議已加研究、並有加發三分輔幣券之說、</p>
<p>淪陷區域　如出一轍</p>
<p>據交通界消息、滬上缺乏銅元之恐慌浪潮、現已迅速侵入各淪陷區域、蓋各淪陷區域如蘇北無錫等處、最近市面上亦感銅元缺乏、零找困難、足證奸商爲利慾所驅策、無孔不入據悉在淪陷區域收買銅兀、早已成爲秘密公開之事件、其事猶如廢銅舊鐵之被大量私運出口、如出一轍、</p>
<p>印花暢銷　禆益國庫</p>
<p>本市目銅輔幣奇缺後各界各業均已用郵票及印花代替最前數日、多數係用郵票、因郵票用途、比較普遍也但最近一二日、則均改用印花、其原因（一）郵票一分者不多、不足以供需要、印花則一分者較多、可以大量借用、以資流通、（二）郵票一經汚損、郵局即須按照章程、作爲欠資、印花則係由各業各界自由貼用、須改印戳後、方行註銷、稍有汚玷、不致作廢、（三）郵票流入淪陷區域、即對方亦可黏貼使用、印花則絕無此項願慮、（五）印花爲國家正稅、使其流通間接裨益國庫、因以上四項理由、各烟兌店經售之印花、乃大爲暢旺、又以端節期近、各業所開之發票及收據、亦均須依法貼花、滿一元者貼一分、三元以上者二分、十兀以上者四分、百元以上者六分、因此需要益大　　各大公司　依法貼花　　至南京路各大公司、如先施·永安·新新·麗華·中國國貨公司、所售各貨、一切發票收據、均早已依法貼花、大新公司自即日起、亦即服貼矣、</p>
<p>市聯分會　發代價券</p>
<p>新閘路市第十六區分會、以迭據會員報吿、市上銅元缺少、營業困難、紛紛要求設法補救、該會以茲事體大、特於昨日下午四時、邀集各商號自行商決、計到久康當·公大·正大·大順昌·茂泰新·成大新·萃和·乾泰昌·乾昌·大順公·同福永·泰豐·泰康·大昌祥·德興昶·榮大·張金記·裕昌德·張信和·恒和祥·松盛新·老文寳·壽康元·信和·元增祥·老晋大·同豐裕·中興·正昌祥·萬興·振康·德康·順康·等各號代表百餘人、經愼重討論後、決議由各商號發行聯合臨時代價券、規定各項如下、（一）定名「新閘路商業臨時聯合代價券、」（二）代價券祇發「一分」一種、均編號留有存根、（三）代價券悉加蓋便印並由領用商號會同蓋章、（四）此項代價券積滿十分、即得向參加各商號兌換法幣一角、參加商號名單、分發各商號揭貼、（五）各商號如遇有僞券發現時、立即報吿澈究、（六）代價券一俟政府定有補救辦法後、即行收回、（七）推王茂卿·朱雲生·王肇基·陳濟成·朱雨陶·瞿秋舫·陳蔚文·王雲彩·胡鑑人·陳釆庭·劉雲卿·等十一人爲券款及鋼印保管委員、（八）券款交銀行專款存儲、提取時須經保管委員五人之簽名蓋章、旋由各商號當場認定需要券數、計共七百五十元、當有商號繼續參加、乃復決定此項臨時一分代價券、以發一千元爲限度、</p>
<p>銅元缺乏　恐慌未除</p>
<p>本埠缺乏銅輔幣、戰後已有多次但未有若此决之嚴重、蓋以往雖吿缺乏、仍有少數在市面流通、僅兌價稍高而已、殊不料此决缺乏銅輔幣、竟至市面完全絕跡、其原因何在、除奸商牟利國積或私運出口外、供給來源之受阻撓、實爲最大因素、故目下本埠因缺乏分幣所引起之恐慌、雖由各業自行設法補救、但尙未能完全消除、</p>

<h3>藥王史話</h3>
<p>— 丁濟民</p>
<p>現在的藥皇誕日，各地大多並不分得怎樣淸楚，差不多已經是「神農氏·韋訊道·及藥王菩薩」三位一體的混合誕日了。如用辨證法看起來，當然以神農代表藥皇是最原始的根據。這是紀念先哲的偉大發明，確是很有意義的。</p>
<p>藥王廟的記載，在各種書籍上很少見，然而現然各城各縣大半都有藥王廟，假使說是各地人士所自動設立，並非由於政府的强制推行，恐怕不會如此普遍吧？元朝曾經通令全國，建造三皇廟，後人不加考證，輾轉誤傳，便成了藥王廟。關於這一點，我們可以引元虞伯生「道國學古錄」的三皇廟記來做證明：</p>
<p>撫州路樂安縣新建三皇廟記：三皇廟者，祠伏羲神農皇帝之神自國都至於郡縣，皆立諸醫者之學，我國家之制也。</p>
<p>澧州路慈利州重建二皇廟記：國家之制，自國都至於郡邑無有遠通，守令有司之所在皆得建廟通祀三皇。……</p>
<p>崇仁縣重建醫學三皇廟記：我世祖皇帝混一字內兼取古今之制，百度修明，以天地之德爲德，以聖神之能爲能，凡所以爲民物慮者，周且悉矣，若夫所爲三皇廟者蓋其一焉。</p>
<p>袁州路分宜縣新建三皇廟記：……定制通祀惟社稷與夫子，我國朝始建三皇之廟以祀伏羲神農黃帝，自國都至於郡縣通祀爲三矣。</p>
<p>看了這些記最，我們就可以明白元世祖確曾憑藉了帝王的力量來督促各地建立「三皇廟」，而並未建立是「藥王廟」。後來不知怎樣竟弄錯了，但在明朝初年士大夫階級便已發現了這種差誤，於是明太祖就頒布了下面這條命令：</p>
<p>洪武四年詔曰：三皇積天立極，開萬世敎化之原，歸於藥師可乎！天下郡縣無得褻祀！</p>
<p>從元初到明初，中間相隔不過八九年，十然而已把好好的「三皇廟」誤爲「藥王廟」，怪不得明太祖要說：「歸於藥師可乎」了！後來淸代毛退之也曾在中西醫話裏提到這件事，他說：</p>
<p>有以藥王指韋訊道之象塑另卉服，與神農之象無異。藉通書所載，四月廿八日藥王誕之語，影射混淆。……</p>
<p>毛氏這一篇議論，說來未免過於肯定；神農嘗百草的功蹟，較之韋氏相差天壤，奉爲藥皇，誰曰不宜？如以近世的眼光看來，非持尊爲我國藥皇，即尊爲世界藥物學之鼻祖</p>

<h3>「藥皇誕辰」之意義</h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>紀念「世界醫藥家之鼻祖」</p>
<p>伍連德博土爲『中國醫學史』序，其起句有云：『神農皇帝，實爲世界醫學家之鼻祖，於歷史上最有光榮！』夫今日中國科學事事落後，乃於世界醫學史上尙能榮居卷首者，神農氏生藥學之發明是也，各國紀念其科學發明家，或年祭或百年祭，或千年祭，莫不隆重備至，引爲『國家之光。』吾國有藥皇誕辰，年年舉國奉祀參拜，雖其誕期爲佛敎藥王誕期所混，但紀念神農之意義則並無錯誤，今以世界眼光視之，則藥皇誕辰，實可謂世界醫藥鼻祖之紀念日，亦卽吾邦唯一『爲國增光』之榮典也。</p>
<p>神農發明本草，已爲舉世所知，考諸史乘，亦能證實如：</p>
<p>史記帝王世紀有言：『炎帝神農氏，長於姜水，因而姓姜，生有聖德，始敎天下耕種五榖而食之，以省殺生之弊，嘗味草木，宣藥療疾，以救天殤之命，百姓日用而不知，著本草四卷。』</p>
<p>甲乙經序有言：『上古神農始嘗草木而知百藥，伊尹以亞聖之才，撰用神農本草以爲湯液。』</p>
<p>搜神記有言：『神農赭鞭，百藥，盡知其平毒寒溫之性，臭味所主以播百榖。』</p>
<p>中國醫學史云：『吾國醫藥之興，始於神農氏，故神農氏爲吾國醫藥之鼻祖，當時民智未啟，居處無定所，未識耕種畜牧之法，以自然產生之植物，爲生活資料，草木中含有催吐促瀉之性質者，亦徑取食之，神農辨別其某也催吐，某也促瀉，某草某木不可作食料，並用催吐之草木以治心窩苦悶之由心，用促瀉之草木以治腹脹便閉之患，此皆醫藥知識所濫觴，史記綱鑑均謂神農氏嘗百草，始有醫藥，淮南子修務訓曰，神農乃始敎民，嘗百草之滋味。』</p>
<p>神農發明本草之學，五千年來，不知若干萬萬人賴以治療疾苦，養生保命，繁殖人口，其嘉惠之久德澤之深，世無其匹。神農本草經中所列藥品，至今猶爲吾國出口貿易之大宗，遺澤幾已遍及世界，在此抗戰期內，政府亦知國藥出口爲換取外匯主力之一，故特設中央藥物研究所於昆明，專司硏究甄別及調整出口之事，據最近發表每年出口數額可達一萬萬元。農民寄託之重，固可想見，而於抗戰期中之國力裨益允巨，是則今日紀念藥皇，且另有重大意義在焉。</p>

<p>，亦無不可。</p>
<p>在隋唐二朝佛敎盛行於中國的時候，佛經上也有「藥王」這個名稱，但並不爲我國士大夫們所重視，並且另外又擁戴了一位國產的藥王出來：這裹不妨也摘錄一些記載，作爲大家的參考：</p>
<p>韋訊道字慈藏，唐京兆人精醫術。武后時爲侍御醫，累遷至光祿卿常帶黑犬隨行，施藥濟人時人敬之，稱爲藥王。</p>
<p>韋訊道號慈藏，唐人。醫中之聖，人皆仰之。人醫家多圖共像以祀之。</p>
<p>忠獻公年六七歲，病甚，忽曰：有道士牽犬以藥飼我，得汗而愈，忠獻王韓琦也。</p>
<p>韋善俊唐武后朝京兆人長齋奉道法，嘗携黑犬名鳥龍，俗謂爲藥王。</p>
<p>醫王姓韋，名古字老師，疏勒國人。唐開元中孟夏，人患疾，徧施藥餌，無不痊平。帝敬禮之，時稱藥王。</p>
<p>以上見唐書方技傳，桐陰舊話，列仙傳和本草綱自序。可見在唐宋之間，韋訊道已經是我國的國產藥王了。</p>
<p>佛經裏有一種呌「觀藥王藥上二菩薩經法華經」裏面有一種呌藥王菩薩本事品，那就是佛敎中另有一個藥王的證據。我曾經覓到一張明代二十五圓通像之五（藥王菩薩與藥上菩薩像），現在也把它印出來，作爲一個旁證。</p>
<p>佛經裏面還有所謂耆婆（譯作耆城）也者，其實就是印度的藥王，各種藥草和食物都得經過他的嘗試。道種情形，却和我國關於神農氏的記載大致相同。</p>

<h3>與神農並稱藥王之　韋訊道小傳</h3>
<p>— 章慶雲</p>
<p>神農之爲吾國藥王，固已彰彰明甚，但世俗之以韋訊道爲藥王，亦已流傳彌久，無法可以推翻，於是遂有「神農，韋訉道，藥王菩薩」之位一體之說。考古今醫史載：「韋訉道，號慈藏，善醫術，常帶黑犬隨行，施藥濟人。唐玄宗重之，擢官不受，當世仰爲藥王」。但他籍所載，亦有誤爲韋善俊或韋歸藏者，並故神其說，謂「其後黑犬化爲黑龍，負以升天」云云，則語近怪誕，不足置信矣。</p>
<h3>杭州藥皇陵沿革</h3>
<p>— 金哲明</p>
<p>宋南渡時，商立以皮塲廟神像携至杭州城隍山看江亭，時有病人，偶往求禱，頗覺靈騐，視爲神農祠廟，一時杳火極盛。紹定（一二三一年）四年，彼燬於火；理宗誥在故址重建新廟，勅名「惠靈廟」。咸淳五年（一二六九年）八月，壽和聖福皇太后賜銀修茸，兩廡繪二十四仙醫，時人指爲佐助神農採藥諸先哲，實則所祀爲天師，貱伯，伯高，少師，太乙，雷公，伊尹，倉公，華陀，皇甫謐，巢元方，韋蕬藏，錢乙，劉完素，李果，鬼叟區，兪跗，桐君，馬帥，神應王扁鵲，張仲景，王叔和，葛洪，孫思邈，王冰，朱肱，張元素，張彥修等，皆上古中古醫藥界先哲，實與神農採藥無關。惠靈廟至康熙九年，（一七七〇年）又遭火刦，十七年，（一六七八年）有李士楨者斥資重修。嘉慶二十一年，又由（一八一六年）藥商重修。道光年間，再加修茸。其後洪楊起義，廟父燬。同治十年（一八七一年）復由杭地藥商協力重建，改名「藥皇殿」。重建之時，並將先哲二十四人之繪像改塑神像，並加塑天醫皮塲兩像。據時人之意，以爲神農爲第一代藥王，皮塲爲第二代藥王，天醫爲第三代藥王。實皆任意造作，於史實無據。廟中二十四像前，各立木主，上記銜名及所司疾病，皆無歷史根據可言；以致紀念先哲之意，完全消失，反成一般迷信病家祈求仙方之所，良堪浩嘆。杭州本爲神道設敎之根據地，在彼神權時代，藥王廟之成爲香火地，亦爲天然趨勢。每年四月二十八日，（農歷）藥王誕辰之期，凡屬藥農藥商，皆上山進香參拜，並食茯苓糕等物，以爲慶樂，尙不失紀念先哲之至意。民國以後，則已多年不再舉行矣。</p>
<h3>食品四種</h3>
<p>— 宋兆榮</p>
<p>下列食物，作爲日常點飢，各有治病之效，而無偏頗之弊；歷來極多治騐，特爲介紹如下：</p>
<p>（一）百合　時有鄉人携市出售，極易購得。食法先分離每小瓣，再去其包裏每小瓣周圍之薄膜，煨熟後入少許白糖，味殊甘芳。俗以白花百合爲治久咳成癆之佳品，其實不必定用白花者，凡肺臟虛弱，時易感冒，或患咳多時，久久不　；或肺癆已成，時見咳血，以百合爲日常食品，較之日服滋膩之品更易奏效也。</p>
<p>（二）山藥　亦有鄉人携市出售，煮熟食之，頗富補虛益損之力。國醫處方，亦常用此：而治下消，即西醫所謂之糖尿病，更有著效。凡小溲飮後即下，多而且濁，即是下消之症，此品不特爲國醫治下消之特效藥，以爲日常食品，更爲相宜。</p>
<p>（三）胡桃　南貨店中有售。功能資血養腦，凡髮少不黑，易於脫落，以之搗爛常服，（或入棗子龍眼白糖等）有奇效。又老年痰飮病者，交冬咳喘不已，以此品搗爛，每日取一二匙開水冲服，有根治痰飮之功。脾胃虛弱，大便時溏者，可去其浮遊於上部之油沫：新感風寒咳喘陡增　，可入老姜一二片爲佳。</p>
<p>（四）苡仁　體素濕盛，舌苔厚濁，或生有濕瘡者，以之煮飮常服，能使蘊濕從小便而漸解。且據近人研究所得，謂其滋養力勝於一切穀類，且能療治肺癆。其有益可知。</p>

<h3>藥王菩薩之來歷</h3>
<p>— （劉宗周）</p>
<p>據一觀藥王藥上「菩薩經」說，過去久遠遠刦有佛，稱一琉璃光照如來」，刦正安穩，國名懸勝旛，在彼佛湼槃之後，於像法中有許多比丘，發心修行，家中有一比丘，名曰「日藏」聰明多智，爲諸家說大乘之平等大慧。爾時復有一長者，名「星宿光，」旣　大乘，心生歡喜，即以訶黎果及藥物，佻養日藏，比丘，及諸家，因發大菩提心。時有星宿光之弟，名「電光明」者亦跟隨乃兄持諸良藥，供養日藏及諸家，發大誓願，於是大寨讚號兄爲「藥王」弟爲「藥上即今日之藥王藥上「菩薩」。後藥王久修梵行，發十二大誓願，救衆生之病源，治無名之痼疾，及諸願已滿，遂於未來世成佛，號「凈眼如來」，又號「藥師琉璃光如來」或「藥師王」又稱「大醫王佛」。（暹邏有玉刻藥王佛像），褊袒趺坐，手置膝上，掌握丸藥，如僧伽狀。</p>

<h3>英人議獻火車</h3>
<p>英民深感火車之裨益人專，而獨以未行於中國爲恨事：遂捐金驟造火車鐵路，呈獻朝廷，以冀上親見其用之便，制之精，仿行於各處。倡爲此舉者，乃一英公名叟得攔者，及洋布巨商名白恩大兩君也。用銀共六萬金，合之的二十萬兩云。夫旣以爲呈獻御覽之物，則其車輛之華美，工作之精巧，概可知矣。聞月前已有此議，旣而英人傳聞津門達京師之途中，有建造火輪鐵路之說，故前議暫停。嗣又悉此信無音據，乃復理前議，現已鳩工購料，輪人與人，交　奏技，俟其成，必有可觀察者。</p>
<h3>山東將設製造廠</h3>
<p>山東省內現擬設立一製造廠，與上海之砲局相類。昨日廣東已有委員數人來滬，係山左撫臺　傳者，不日前往東省議事舉辦矣。又聞該廠之設，大抵將在燕臺也。</p>
<h3>漁婦怪產</h3>
<p>杭州淸泰門外，有漁戶余某之妻，珠胎將剖，數日前夜間，腹痛欲裂，余某即延接生婆至，須臾，一孩呱呱墮地。穩婆視之，大呼怪事！因所產之兒，頭有四角，眼無雙請，鼻尖有口，足趾生距，允異者，耳大如猪也。衆人見之，無不駭異；旦其音甚尖細，啁哲直如鳥鳴。至决日方死云。此事由杭來友人目擊，當不妄也。說者謂余某施網置于海塘，先後泛宅浮家，感蛟龍之氣，故有此異也。</p>

<h3>所望於副刊讀者的</h3>
<p>— 尚卿</p>
<p>這並不是我賣關子，也不是我故甚其辭：假使說，對於一個副刊，投稿者的重要勝於編者是對的，那末讀者的重要勝於投稿者，尤其是對的。理由很簡單，編者是分配者，投稿者是供給者，而讀者則是需要者。按之一般通則，需要可以決定一切，所以讀者也可以左右編者和投稿者。此外，讀者佔絕對多數，讀者是大眾，編者和投稿者尤非服從不可。</p>
<p>旣然讀者對於一個副刋，是操着無上的權戚的，所以我格外要對他們發出我的希望來。</p>
<p>有許多讀者，允共是年輕的學生，以爲編者和投稿者，總是有大才的人，他們的文章，總是好的，他們的意見，總是對的，因此有時看到了實在莫名其妙或違反心意的作品，也就含胡過去，不敢詢問。這是不對的，應該認淸編者與投稿者，決非十全十美的才子，總也有不到之處的，所以我希望這樣的讀者勿自卑。</p>
<p>但是有許多讀者，雖然年長的爲多，年輕的也未嘗沒有，却與前者適得其反，以爲編者總是糊塗蟲，投稿者總是庸人，對於他們的副刊，連正眼都不肯瞅一下，大的要編者向他們請敎，別的投稿者虛左以待，方才會合他們的意。這也是不對的，究竟一個副刊的成立，必然有牠所以存立的理由，決不能對於牠的編者和投稿者，就此一概抹殺，所以我希望這樣的讀者勿自傲。</p>
<p>勿自卑勿自傲的讀者是正當的讀者，我希望他們對於一個副刋，換言之，對於該副刋的編者或投稿者，如果有什麽意見，儘可發表出來，方式是寫信給編者或者自爲投稿者，寫成文章投去。這樣，編者和其他投稿者，固然會因你的意見而有所得益，便是一切讀者，連你自己在內，也就會受到你的優良影響了。</p>
<p>你這樣發表意見時，自然知道你應該說出你所不贊成的，和你所希望的種種事項；自然更知道你應該勿畏縮，勿過激，而平心靜氣，侃侃而談的。這是你應取的態度，你知道，我也不必多說。可是常你用這樣態度來發表意見，允其寫信給編者的時候，我希望你會有下列的兩種決心：</p>
<p>服善。如果你發表自己錯誤時，你肯取消你的意見，一定不會强詞奪理，或者惱羞成怒，引起人我雙方無益而有損的麻煩。因爲副刊旣是大衆的，大衆決不會容你逞私。</p>
<p>去惡。反之，如果你發見自己並不錯誤時，我却願你堅持下去，一再申說，來達到你的目的，或者至少使你所注意的這副刊，修正到略可滿足的地步。因爲副刊旣是大衆的，大衆自會擁護你的正當的主張。</p>
<p>當然我知道，所難的是你不知道自己的意見是吾錯誤，因此，我就是希望你在你沒有十分把握，充份了解一個問題時，就暫時不要發表意見。等到有了眞知灼見時，你才實行你的態度與決心。</p>
<p>總之，我希望每一個副刊的讀者，就以你所看的副刊爲你自己的所有物，而設想你就是編者，就是投稿者。你須愛護牠：牠好，你要發揮光大牠；牠不好，你要矯正牠，帮助牠。每一個正當的副刊，總是願意聽到讀者的意見的，希望你會盡讀者之責，與牠滿意。</p>
<p>不錯，副刋可以誘導讀者；然而允其不錯，讀者可以促進副刋。必須讀者與副刊合作，就是與編者和投稿者合作，副刋和讀者才會雙方並得其利。</p>
<p>你們想想看：那一個副刊應該與以發揮光大的？那一個副刊應該與以矯正或帮助的？我希望你們想到了就實行！</p>
<h3>獻旗</h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>—戰地追記—</p>
<p>從麻城折回宋埠，天正下着傾盆大雨，一輛供運輸用的敞車，在泥濘飛濺的黑夜中奔馳，跟呷醉了老酒的人一樣，那麼一歪一斜地。我們沒有帶雨具，只好蜷伏一起，把骯髒的油布遮蔽着。可是雨却越下越大，彷彿瀑布傾瀉，江河倒流，弄得滿身淋漓，跟落湯雞相同了。不過想到濠塹裏面的英勇鬥士，有時下起雨來，儘管水沒過膝頭，他們還是精神抖擻，保持着原來的姿態；所以我們對於暴風雨的來襲，不單處之泰然，更要感謝天公的好意，給我們洗去了征塵。</p>
<p>卡車駛進了樹木森森的兵監部，陳參議已經備下晚飯；待飯畢就寢時，我將鄕村訪問作爲話題，對他述說一遍。兵監部的鄭主任，在北伐時期，也扭任過軍事運輸，據他說政治工作做得最特色的，要讓還八路軍，共决就推廣西，麻城有這樣的成績，當然可以滿意的。「打流運動，沒有老百姓合作，那是絕對不成的！」他堅決地說。</p>
<p>陳參議挺健談，一口的崇明官話，跟曹聚仁兄的浦江官話，有『異曲同工』之妙；在瀰天烽火中得與風雨聯牀，的確意想不到。</p>
<p>「田家鎭沒有問題，武漢是不會動搖的。」</p>
<p>「即使有問題，也決不放棄武漢！」</p>
<p>這樣結束了當夜的談話。所以說武漢的撤軍，關係在於廣州，要不然，三鎭是不致遽陷的。翌晨，我們準備舒齋，決往潢川一行；這時平漢錢南段戰事，已展開極激烈的一幕，甚至謠傳優陽即將放棄。一他們果然踏進了大別山脈，就無異足陷泥淖，除了淪爲異域之鬼，便休想生還了。」鄭主任說，快意的微笑，掠過他的圓臉。但我們正要吿別宋埠，兵監部接到潢川來電，知道李宗仁將軍不日來鄂，而武漢文化界到此勞軍的消息，也同時證實，這眞是意外的喜訊。除去我與老姚之外，其餘七人，全是皖省民衆代表，任務爲獻旗致敬，事畢仍須回皖，所以一路同行。</p>
<p>僅僅隔了兩個鐘頭，李將軍已從前方回來，英姿颯爽，丯神奕奕，一點兒沒有倦容。他稍微休息一下，便接見獻旗諸代表，那麼雍容和藹的態度，不由不使人肅然景仰。</p>
<p>「啊啊！太辛苦了！」李將軍首先發言，笑容可掬地。</p>
<p>「理應恭詣前方奉獻的，請司令長官原諒！」</p>
<p>吳小姐代表全體表示歉意，在莊嚴肅穆的禮節中，捧陳了紅綢的旗幟。接着，她又將皖省民衆擁護的摯情，用簡單明快的語句陳述，這才吿辭了出來。「偉大的民族抗爭領導者！」吳小姐誠服地崇讚着。</p>

<h3>印象的旅遊</h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>跟那些有偏僻性的人一樣，我喜歡荒野，有原始性的山林。海也是我所酷愛的，如果在平靜的沙灘，風收浪飲。可是我也效過新派名詩人士那麽的遊興，如在萬壽山，獄麓，西湖，却不曾得到什麽可錄的印象。爲着有都市社會的襯陪，這些地方的遊行每每那麼公式化，少帶一個銅子就要領略一種「不安」，和上廣東茶樓，坐在五分七分廳似的。提起筆，給這些地方寫遊記，山必得「拔勁」，雲必得「渾厚」，流泉必得「淙淙」，沒有這種格調，遊記便缺少逸致了。</p>
<p>可是，戴上左拉的眼鏡來看名勝風景，却是有意糟蹋左拉這名字。原來遊記本來是個淺薄稱呼，以小說常遊記寫，以遊記當小說寫，都是多事。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>一九三八年四月，我第一次作南嶽的巡行，向遊者祇有廣東籍的彭其興，共振兩兄弟</p>
<p>跟外省人一道，爲了兩起間言語觀感的不同，較之本地人要感覺新異些。他們的故鄉在陸豐，由廣州的住址流浪到這來，一半爲的避炸彈，一半爲尋訪朋友，形貌上，看來帶點倖運，但內心却蘊有不盡的慘寂。</p>
<p>打衝山縣城廂到南嶽鎭，這二十分鐘汽車行程，彼此間都啞啞的，有若預備到人家去弔喪的派頭。路兩側的風景是單調的—山嶺，山嶺，山嶺，不過蓋著春來的柔綠，呌初學水彩的在紙上多費些黃綠色料罷了。座衆中，有傷兵，難民，居家的紳士，小商，老農和呆着馬臉的縣署辦事人員等。南獄鎭不算小，北平的海甸，上海的江滿鎮大的可比擬了。有公園，在偏東，還在開闢，劉膺古題署的石牌坊已生長六七年了；朝南，有像闊人別墅的嶽雲學校；鎭市近廂，有民衆遝動塲，藍底白字的標語，陡然呌過路行人增加一種精神上的興奮。我們由汽車站轉到市街，默默地意識着街雨旁的店家，踏不整齊，跟着石版的高低起伏的步子，半晌才招到一間換了新招牌的飯館。</p>
<p>老闆是個湘潭人，他向我們報着菜名，跟三家村的學童背千字文一樣。</p>
<p>隨意點了三種菜，我們將南嶽的地圖張開，一羣參謀似的，討論着怎樣前進。湘潭老闆把荼帶了上來，順便吿訴我們說，「遊一天是不彀的。遊一天，祇算跑路。遊兩天，輸到看山。遊三天，就能看廟。五天六天，做詩也行，畫畫也彀七八成菜子園啦。看先生們怎麽辦。轎子我們這裏可以代雇。」</p>
<p>湘潭「漂」很有些描寫工夫的。我們不能不由他的經騐決定遊期的久暫。</p>
<p>湘潭老闆見兩彭是外省人，便對他們說：</p>
<p>「自從何老闆（指何鍵）經管了幾年以後，到現在，南嶽眞値得一遊啦。坐轎，有一定的價，住庵子，大大小小一元錢一天，都一定的價。起初是一里十餘折，十步八九休，現在不同多啦，馬路上眞可以賽球。起初，南嶽一山不生一毛，有土的地方也不留一樹，現在，有什麼種植會大事經營啦。起初，庵子東歪西折，不漏雨就透風，大和尙敲詐，小和尙偷摸，現在庵于全給整理，和尙們也是大家派頭啦。起初，斷黑就要裏脚，不是看見老虎，就碰着强盜，現在，天天有警兵巡邏，連呌化子也趕盡啦……</p>
<p>這樣訴下去，使我們眞感覺南嶽的不凡了。我們增加了不少的興趣。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>南嶽原來就以童禿著名的，磽确的高峯太多，除開谷底蒼翠，孤松筆立，於巖鏬中外，草都是稀少的，新揷的樹苗，也都萎頓不長。有林木，花草，流泉的地方，大都有了闊人和僧道屬主，好像僅有的幾隻鳥雀也大家閨秀般的。縷絲潭華嚴湖的流水，沿着馬路的巖脚直瀉，溯着來頭一望，眞不知源自何處，匯到何處。無怪山洪暴發，祇好讓它在田野泛濫，連水牛也給沒死。</p>
<p>有些工程，顯然是異常拙劣。我發現一座溝通東西兩崖的大橋，說也奇怪，他們把它築成一垜墻一樣，不開洞。水從那裹流過呢？祇好毀磚裂石，把化了整萬元的工程摧折，以至連兩旁的路也冲倒。這是怎樣的拙劣！</p>
<p>這一帶沒有別種建築，廣東人不懂這情形有什麽好處。我無聊賴的吹噓了些說：</p>
<p>「歷史上，這山是大大著名的。據傳說，大禹治水，到過這裏。離開這裹二十多里有個呌廣濟寺的庵子，旁邊有個禹王城，就是給他留下紀念的地方。這是有史以前的把戲，後來遊山留芳的，漢，唐，宋，明，都有，這大概很靠得住。我們再走六七里，到了半山亭，就可找到李靖的隱居地方。」</p>
<p>廣東人對於歷史很不感興味。他們多半是從古老環境中推移到嶺南一帶的，習俗所歸，祇懂得一個地方有沒有生產，有沒有實利。（未完）</p>
<h3>（三）愛之源泉</h3>
<p>— 桑</p>
<p>我若将所有的關濟窮人，以捨已身，叫人焚燒，郤沒有愛，仍然與我無益；因爲愛不自誇，人生不可缺的三要素，有信有望有愛，這三樣，其中最大的是愛，愛不加害於人，有愛就能凡事包容，恨能挑啓爭端，愛能遮掩一切的過錯，我願世上辦教育的，能實行愛的教育，開醫院的，有愛的醫院，人與人相處，能彼此以愛相等。但可惜人不知道何謂愛！因這世間是，所能找到的愛，無非是偏面的，狹義的，條件的，肉體的，相對的！故今爲讀者介紹真愛之泉源，圣經說：『神就是愛，神差他的兒子耶穌基督到世上來，當我們遷作罪人的時候，耶穌爲我們死，神的愛在此此向我們證明了，因爲愛是從神來的，凡有愛心的都是由神而生，並且認識神，』神的愛是從耶穌在十字架上爲罪人死的時候起，就開了泉源，不知讀者你願意接受这伟大爱源的浇灌嗎？你願意使基督因你的信，住在你心裹，叫你的愛心，有根有基，實現愛的生活嗎？</p>

<h3>一張「馮宅堂會」名貴的戯單</h3>
<p>— 李斐叔</p>
<p>梅邊雜憶之三</p>
<p>自從梅花包主在本刊發表驚人的劇訊，直到本刊聲明所謂「白宅堂會因吳子玉將軍的電阻而取消」之後，在這幾天之中，掀動了孤島上整個劇界的狂瀾！戲迷們與非戲迷們奔走相吿人，如獲至寳。不佞明知其離事實太遠，並未替梅浣華先生有所聲明，蓋在這樣陰靈四佈，沈悶欲死的環境中，落得使孤島的羣眾，服一粒有刺激性的興奮劑。正如蘇聯與偽滿發生衝突的消息一樣，又何必一定說其是「謠言」而令人掃興呢！</p>
<p>驚人的劇訊中，提到馮碧頎女士，我却此回　到民國八九年間，馮宅堂會之盛况。馮女士的所天，，即前「中　銀行總裁」馮幼偉先生，馮先生是梅氏一生的知己，梅之得有今日，端　馮先生提　敎晦，參贊導引之功。那年的堂會，是馮太夫人七十壽辰，所有舊京第一流的名義，除王　　　　　中，尚小雲馬聽良似在外埠，故未　加外，其餘凡係生，旦，凈，末，丑，武生，武旦，花旦，各行龍楚，可謂搜羅殆遍，極人才之大全。在那時叔岩的聲望，也沒有像今日這樣的隆重。而程艷秋熱贊梅門，更無多日，且倒嗓市行烣復，正在脫　之時也。</p>
<p>茲將那天馮宇堂會的戲單，檢寄游藝界，印列於後，單中的老伶工如田桂鳳，孫菊仙，　雲甫，陳德霖，裘桂仙，劉鴻聲，楊小樓，李壽山，錢金福，王長林，俞　庭…等等，大都已成古人。眼前再想召集這樣盛大的堂會，實在匪易了！祇好讓辮子大師狗肉將軍他們去欣賞罷！</p>
<p>這張戲目上的字體，剛健阿娜，修潔工整，原來是大詩人大名士羅廮公先生的手筆也。（原底現藏梅氏綴玉軒中，）羅先生墓木已拱矣，所以更覺得這張戲單的名貴可珍了。</p>
<h3>格露麗史都　到滬後的行踪</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>對這「東方巴黎」　覺得異樣的有趣</p>
<p>關於好萊塢女明星格露麗史都和她的丈夫約瑟希克門到滬的消息，已　　　刊，這裏所說的，　　　　到滬　　日的行踪。</p>
<p>格露麗史都到了上海之後，特別　她感到興趣的，便是上海這東方的巴黎　　　　一切。而連日她往各商店選購物品，參加各界的招待會，是相當的忙碌。</p>
<p>自中日發生戰事之後，好萊塢著名的女星，來至上海，她可算是第二個。（第一個便是上月過　的琴納弗托　）據她到滬的一天向各報記者所發表的談話，那末她這次在上海將有一星期的　留。</p>
<p>據說二十世紀的新片由格露麗史都主演的「奪得錦標歸」Winner　Take　All　將於月底在本埠公映，而她另一新片「為能取樂於汝」It　Could　Happen　to　You，由她丈夫希克門編劇，她在離開好萊塢之前，才拍攝完竣的，也輪在七月底在本埠公映。</p>
<p>然而她夫婦倆在滬祇有一星期的停留，不能目覩她主演影片在滬公映的盛况，也許是一件憾事哩！她倆離開上海之後，將往香港，印度支那，和東印度各地遊歷，然後取道歐洲，回歸美國，完成周遊世界的企圖。</p>
<h3>高占非白楊尚示抵港</h3>
<p>— 玉繩</p>
<p>但確有短時期內回滬之訊</p>
<p>外間有高占非白楊已同行抵港，被香港各影片公司包圍的傳說。昨日經記者向各方面探詢的結果，證明高占非白楊尚逗留蜀中，不過確有短時期內動身回上海的消息，若說已到了香港則未免言之過早。</p>
<p>去年，新華影業公司有代表在重慶，曾專誠與白楊接洽，請白楊他日回滬後加入新華拍戲，白楊對於這一個要求是接受了，憑了有成約在先，白楊回滬後又是使新華增一健將。</p>
<p>至於高占非，過去曾為新華主演過「黃海大盜」，現在他與白楊同行同止，如果白楊進新華，老高當然是「跟進」無疑。</p>
<p>所可慮的倒是高街蘋一方面的問題，過去大家都是「老高「小高」連在一起喊的，現在老高與白楊將駕臨上海，不知高倩蘋將表示什麽態度呢？</p>
<h3>影壇奇女子　瓊克勞馥韻事錄</h3>
<p>— 鳳翔</p>
<p>男友的臂懷常作臨時搖籃　離異的丈夫依然藕斷絲連</p>
<p>譽滿影壇的瓊克勞馥小姐（Joan　Crowford），生平最恨睡眠，每夜筆來不佔床席，原因是為了像好萊塢的那種富於「烟士披里純」的夜生活，實在太使人留戀，萬萬不肯放過。然而睡眠總是一種人體各部補足消耗與恢復疲勞的生理休息，無論何人，是不能避免的。因此克勞馥小姐在這種環境下，養成了另一種習慣，不論在交際宴會中，不論在攝影塲里，她能隨時隨地小睡一會兒，而男友的臂懷，常常作為她的臨時搖籃。</p>
<p>最近，克勞馥小姐帶了她心愛的哈巴狗，已從好萊塢安抵紐約。到了紐約後第一件事，是約了與她當年宣吿離異的丈夫茀侖喬，唐（Franchot　Tone）在一個夜總會里聚餐一次，以示紀念。當音樂台上奏起悠揚的歌曲時，這一雙離異是否是「愛的破裂或終止」的疑問。總之，這種「藕斷絲不斷」的韻事，也唯有這位影壇奇女子才表演得出。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>孫毓堃侯喜瑞墮落下去太可惜了</p>
<p>後來弄得幾個下手也慢慢星散，唱武生的要是沒有得力的下手，臨時找幾個新搭當，那是決不會有精彩的，現在武生人材太缺乏了，盛春盛斌等究嫌幼稚，毓堃確有幾分神似俞楊，倘能力自振作，到南邊來出演一下，我想凡是懷想小樓的人全要對他贊許的。</p>
<p>侯喜瑞是富連成社頭科弟子，不但在喜字班裏處是數一數二的高材生，就是在平津的凈行中，也是與壽臣並駕齊驅的。當程硯秋剛露頭角的時候，曾以「紅拂傳」享過盛名，劇中虬髯公一角，就以喜瑞任之。他的武工極好，比較少山壽臣全要高出一籌，同時唱兩句也很沉着有味，所他扮虬髯，可謂非常稱職。硯秋自個也覺得該劇實非喜瑞配演，不能有相得益彰。去歲於老友江子誠席間與硯秋相遇，同座有妙香少樓諸人，余曾詢其此次南來何以不演」紅拂傳，」渠以無人能飾虬髯對。又詢蔣少奎如何？硯秋含笑答曰，少奎非俠，實强盜耳。從這句話裏，我們可知硯秋對於喜瑞的藝術是怎樣推崇的了。不過程侯郭（仲衡）王（又荃）周（瑞安）自從拆夥以後，直到現在未甞合作過，故而硯秋的這齣戲也就從此不再露演了。</p>
<p>喜瑞自與程劇團脫離後，身價一天低似一天，凡北平各戲館貼演，「法門寺」的，不論主角是票友是內行，是男角是坤伶，只要出幾元錢呌他去唱，他沒有不接受的，緃令一天趕幾個館子，他也不覺得失身分。同時郝壽臣每與小樓慶奎合演，非一百六十元或至少一百元的戲份，不願出台，並且還得先付後唱，所以無形中郝侯二人的身價聲譽，就相差很遠了。喜瑞不但是藝名日退，而且他個人的私生活也非常墮落，染了黑白嗜好不算，無事時還喜歡逛三等班子，後來弄得同行中都沒人答理他。就是偶爾同他遇在一處，兩人一同走道兒，都怕涉了嫌疑。（三七）</p>
<h3>李大深赴港候駕　陳雲裳五星期後來滬</h3>
<p>— （銀笛）</p>
<p>「西廂記」事件歌詞解决</p>
<p>陳雲裳於完成「雲裳仙子」之後，衣錦還鄕，南行赴港，一去兩月餘，香港各影片公司紛紛請她拍戲，又是粵語片，又是國語片，外加還有英語片，忙得不亦樂乎。本來陳雲裳在香港影界，地位居於李綺年之下，而現在則後來居上，紅過李綺年了。</p>
<p>最近，為了傳說香港面粵影業公司有請陳雲裳拍「西廂記」的消息，於是新華公司特地派發行主任李大深到香港去，阻止此事，因為新華公司在半年以前就請歐陽予倩編寫「西廂記」的劇本，也是預備派陳雲裳主演的，其次陳雲裳與新華，訂有合同，不能不徵求新華的同事意而胡亂拍片，這就是新華要阻止陳雲裳在香港拍「西廂記」的兩點緣由。</p>
<p>現在李大深已有報吿來滬，「西廂記」事件，可望解決，（大槪將停拍國語片，而僅拍粵語片。）陳雲裳在香港，大槪還有五個星期的逗留，即將再度來滬，踐新華之約。而李大深則將作「留守大臣」暨覊香港，等待陳雲裳幾部預約的戲拍完，後然伴同她重來上海。</p>

<h3>Japanese Blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin: Japanese Soldiers Guard All Border Obstacles; British Ambassador to Japan Visits Arita to Discuss the Tense Situation; the United States and France Guarantee Interests and Take Unified Action with Britain</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The British Concession here has been blockaded from 5:00 AM this morning. Obstacles have been placed at all borders, and soldiers are guarding them. It is reported that the old Tianjin military authorities notified the British Concession yesterday, roughly stating that while the British proposal for a compromise solution is admirable, it is unfortunately too late. The Japanese side has already made various arrangements for the blockade. In such a short period, it is impossible to change the procedures that have already been arranged. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, visited the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita this afternoon to discuss the tense situation in Tianjin. Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, and Army Minister Itagaki met for several hours today. According to semi-official sources, these three have decided to implement strict policies to deal with foreign concessions in China, as they have become bases for the Chiang Kai-shek regime. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Hull and State Department officials are closely monitoring the Japanese preparations for blockading the British and French Concessions in Tianjin today. It is reported here that the Japanese side has sent a blockade notice to the U.S. Consulate, expressing hope that American merchants will comply with it. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Tianjin is garrisoned by 250 U.S. Marines. There are a total of 400 American residents in the city, and the total number of expatriates under the jurisdiction of the American Consulate in Tianjin is over 1,200. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After receiving the declaration from the Japanese military regarding their plan to blockade the British and French Concessions in Tianjin yesterday, the government solemnly stated that the cooperation of the U.S. Navy in the Far East with other navies to protect public interests and maintain order in China has always been a customary practice. The U.S. Marines stationed in various Chinese commercial ports are directly ordered by the U.S. government to protect American interests in China. The State Department is extremely concerned about the development of the situation in Tianjin. Official statistics show that there are 400 American residents in Tianjin, most of whom live in the British and French Concessions. American property in Tianjin is valued at 12 million yuan in legal tender, and the annual business volume of American merchants is valued at 20 million yuan in Chinese and foreign currency. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government officially adopted a serious attitude last night towards the situation caused by the Japanese authorities' blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. A government spokesman declared, "The situation in Tianjin is very tense." He also announced that France has discussed with Britain and the United States a unified action regarding the interests of third countries in Tianjin. French officials recalled that French defense commanders in the Far East were invited to Singapore for a joint British naval and military conference. Officials indicated that this conference may have significant implications for the Tianjin situation. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, the Japanese are continuing their blockade of the concessions. As a result, the areas along the concession borders are becoming increasingly crowded with people and vehicles. Although food is allowed to be brought into the concessions, the transfer procedures are slow due to the excessive crowding of people and vehicles at the Japanese sentry posts. Although foreigners are searched when passing through the Japanese sentry lines, no foreign property has been confiscated so far. The foreign business community is now feeling the impact of the blockade, and staff numbers have been reduced to a minimum. At the same time, Chinese employees of various businesses in the concessions did not go to locations outside the concessions today. (Associated Press, 14th) The British and French governments are now in close contact and carefully studying the situation in Tianjin. What decisions will be made is kept secret by officials. However, according to Le Figaro, Britain and France have decided on a joint action plan. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Presents Five Demands</p>
<p>(Tianjin) British and other foreign women and children who did not want to be trapped in the British Concession during the current hot summer months left in large numbers yesterday after the Japanese side announced the blockade of the British Concession starting at 6:00 AM today. Most of them went to Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao, but quite a few also went to Beiping. Japanese newspapers stated that only those with official business in the concession would be exempt from searches when entering or leaving. One Japanese official said that food could be freely transported into the concession. The general British population has decided not to be seriously threatened by this, but the general sentiment is anger rather than fear. British light infantry patrolled the borders of the concession in trucks. From 6:00 AM this morning, all pedestrian and vehicle traffic between the Japanese Concession, Tianjin City, and the British and French Concessions has been cut off. The International Bridge will not be allowed to be crossed from 6:00 AM until midnight, and traffic will be blocked on the other six roads from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Japanese personnel are stationed at these seven locations to search pedestrians and vehicles. Ships on the Hai River must also stop at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf or be searched by Japanese personnel. In addition to demanding the extradition of the four suspects in the assassination case, the Japanese are now demanding that the British abandon their pro-Chiang Kai-shek policy, namely, not to: protect anti-Japanese and pro-Communist elements; assist Chinese legal tender, causing Allied Reserve notes to be affected; monopolize goods; allow illegal elements to use wireless communications; and permit schools to use anti-Japanese textbooks. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Stringent Inspections and a Silent Street Scene</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, since the Japanese side implemented the blockade of the foreign concessions, nationals of Germany, Italy, and the United States have not encountered much difficulty. However, British and Chinese people wishing to enter or leave the British and French concessions are subjected to strict searches. British people must also answer questions and submit nationality documents for inspection. It is reported that some Chinese people were asked to undress in the guard rooms for inspection, but foreigners have not been subjected to this treatment. A British man named Meyer, a film cameraman who was on board the U.S. gunboat Panay when it was bombed in the Yangtze River in December 1937, was arrested by the Japanese side for taking photographs on the International Bridge and is still in custody tonight. Although the British authorities have tried to rescue him, they have been unsuccessful. However, Major Lau, who was arrested yesterday for taking photographs in the former Russian Concession, has been released after negotiations by the British authorities and is now awaiting a ship to Dalian. The Japanese side has declared martial law on the Hai River, prohibiting ships from traveling between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM. A tugboat belonging to the Dagukou Tugboat Company was stopped by the Japanese side outside the border of the British Concession this morning while sailing downstream. It was released after a thorough search. When the ship returned, it was searched again at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf, only a few minutes apart from the previous search. The crew was not harassed. No other foreign ships have been reported to have moved today. The situation at the borders of the foreign concessions has not changed. The concessions are quite empty, and the streets are silent, unlike the usual hustle and bustle. A Reuters reporter toured the southern border of the British Concession this morning and saw that the Japanese allowed people leaving the concession to enter the former German Concession via Wilson Street, while those entering the concession were instructed to use Shanxi Road, a squalid side street about half a mile south. There were many people standing in line at the seven Japanese checkpoints this morning waiting to be inspected, some lines as long as half a mile. The search procedures were so slow that many people were unable to get to their offices on time. Although some vegetables were transported into the British Concession this morning, the municipal council vegetable market was almost completely without supplies. Food prices have soared, with some prices increasing by 70% today. Although the Japanese side superficially allows food to be transported into the concession, Chinese vendors dare not attempt to supply the blockaded area with food for fear of being accused of being anti-Japanese elements. Today, the local newspaper published regulations regarding entry into the British and French Concessions, stating that only those with an absolute need to enter the foreign areas will be allowed to enter, except for foreigners holding consulate passes. All goods and vehicles must be inspected. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>German and Italian Vehicles Freely Enter and Exit</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese garrison in Tianjin began blockading the British and French concessions from 5:00 AM today and stationed troops at the main roads leading into the concessions. The import of goods into Tianjin has currently come to a halt. Pedestrians on the street must undergo strict searches by Japanese soldiers before they can enter or leave the two concessions. The Japanese side conducts inspections on all pedestrians regardless of nationality, and each person is searched for 15 minutes. Therefore, after leaving the concession once, it takes three hours to return to the concession. However, cars flying the flags of Germany and Italy can freely pass through the blockade without the trouble of inspection. Furthermore, in the interest of mutual concession, the British side suggested setting up an international committee to determine whether the four Chinese suspects in the assassination case should indeed be handed over to the Japanese side. The committee members would consist of one person each from Britain, Japan, and a neutral country, with the chairman being a neutral party. However, the Japanese authorities here have now rejected this proposal. The British Volunteer Corps (i.e., the merchant corps) in this city were fully mobilized yesterday to provide security. However, because the situation was quite peaceful, the corps members returned home to rest. Also, the streets of the two concessions are quite deserted today, as rickshaws have disappeared and commerce with the outside world has effectively stopped. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>The Japanese Intention is Obvious</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Cabinet discussed the situation in Tianjin last night, and Foreign Minister Arita reported on Japan's determination to respond to the situation. The Yomiuri Shimbun recently commented on the British compromise proposal, stating that Japan's goal is not just the issue of one British concession in Tianjin. Japan has now begun to address the entire issue of foreign concessions in China and the Far Eastern policies of Britain and France. It is reported that Britain recently proposed forming a three-person committee, with one British person, one Japanese person, and a neutral person as chairman, to determine whether the four people demanded by the Japanese side are guilty and should be extradited. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesman recently declared that controlling currency is one of the main reasons for blockading the Tianjin concession, and stated that if anyone is found to possess illegal paper money, it will be confiscated immediately. However, if foreign banks can cooperate with the "North China United Reserve Bank," the Japanese attitude can be eased. The spokesman also stated that the blockade of the concession is not intended to obstruct the transport of food, and that the Tianjin authorities' rejection of the British compromise conditions was not discussed with Tokyo beforehand. As for the extradition of the assassination suspects, it is a secondary issue, as Japan's biggest demand is that Britain guarantee that it will not interfere with Japan's policy toward China. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo reports that at a meeting on the 14th, key cabinet members decided that Japan should continue to advance its predetermined policy on the issue of foreign concessions in China. Foreign Minister Arita met with Prime Minister Hiranuma at 2:00 AM, and Army Minister Itagaki is also scheduled to continue talks with Hiranuma and Arita in the afternoon to exchange views on the Japanese measures after the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Both the Nichinichi Shimbun and the Yomiuri Shimbun stated that merely handing over the suspects in the assassination case would not resolve the Tianjin incident. Local Japanese authorities will continue to isolate the British and French concessions in Tianjin until the British consider their attitude. If the British are unwilling to create a new order in East Asia with Japan, the blockade will continue. Japanese newspapers generally stated that the government will proceed with its established policy toward foreign concessions in China, as foreign concessions have proven to be a major obstacle to Japan's efforts to establish a new order in East Asia. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese-appointed mayor of Tianjin issued a declaration today, roughly stating that the British have been detained, and that we can proceed with our work of establishing a new order in East Asia. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Members of the House of Commons Raise Questions</p>
<p>(London) In the British House of Commons today, after Foreign Undersecretary Butler made a brief statement, members raised questions about the serious situation in Tianjin, indicating their concern. Labor MP Noel-Baker asked the government whether it could tell the Japanese government that if the Japanese authorities continue their current actions toward the public concessions, it will inevitably produce extremely serious consequences. Butler replied that he thought the Japanese authorities were aware of the British government's attitude. Conservative MP Milner asked whether it would be possible to establish a court or use the existing court in the British Concession to try the suspects based on all the evidence, and whether this could be done in the future. Butler replied that the Japanese demand for the extradition of the four suspects in the assassination case has special circumstances, and the government will consider any possible solutions. Labor MP Bellenger said that if the government issued a firm statement declaring that the government would not tolerate the Japanese blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin, he and the House of Commons would welcome it. Butler replied that he intended Bellenger to reconsider his statement that "the situation is serious, but negotiations are still ongoing, and a solution is expected." (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Moreing asked whether the government would immediately notify the Japanese government that if they did not stop the blockade, they would deny the Japanese the right to use the ports of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Penang. Foreign Undersecretary Butler replied that the question of what means would be most appropriate to deal with the current blockade is currently under study, and part of it will depend on the nature of the actions taken by the Japanese side. Labor MP Bellenger continued to ask whether British expatriates in the Tianjin concession had experienced any suffering due to the lack of food or rising prices. Butler replied that he had heard that the Japanese had no intention of cutting off the supply of food to the foreign concessions in Tianjin, and that he could report on food prices if notified. Conservative MP Milner also asked whether the government intended to make further statements on this matter today or within days. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax was awaiting official information on the current situation and would be willing to inform the House of Commons as soon as possible. Liberal MP Mander asked whether the government was in close contact with the French and American governments regarding the handling of the Tianjin dispute.

<p>Foreign Minister Wang Issues a Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, when meeting with a Reuters reporter today, issued the following statement regarding the Japanese blockade of the foreign concessions in Tianjin, "The Japanese blockade of the foreign concessions in Tianjin, the detention of British military attaché in China, Mr. Spears, the killing of British expatriate Mr. Tingle, and the incitement of anti-British actions, are intended to test the extent to which their declared policy of seizing all foreign concessions and settlements can be implemented. Japan does not even respect the rights and interests of its allies in the Anti-Comintern Pact. If they are allowed to achieve their goals through blatant seizure and allowed to continuously infringe upon foreign interests, the future status of all countries within the areas under Japanese jurisdiction will be bleak. Those aggressors who first invaded China are now encroaching on third countries. It is a mistake to think that satisfying the demands of the Japanese can resolve the situation created by this aggression, as the aggressors are only waiting for a suitable opportunity to completely close the 'Open Door' and drive all Western forces out of Asia." Wang concluded, "If all countries can collectively stop buying Japanese goods and prohibit all access to Japan, without letting their interests and rights be trampled upon, then Japanese threats can be eliminated." (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The United Daily News here today published an article criticizing the Tianjin situation, urging the British and French authorities to adopt a firm attitude towards the current situation in Tianjin and warn the Japanese side, and urging the British and French authorities to discuss effective joint action with the United States as soon as possible, while accelerating the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to resist aggression. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>The Bad Precedent of Blockade Cannot Be Allowed to Exist</p>
<p>(Paris) The situation in Tianjin, China, has recently been commented on by various newspapers here. The right-wing Le Figaro published a dispatch from its correspondent in London stating, "The British Concession in Tianjin, with its tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign residents, has been blockaded by the Japanese army, setting a bad precedent. In the future, the Japanese military authorities may use this as a precedent and further blockade all Chinese ports that still have foreign concessions in the same way. The British government has decided to adopt a firm attitude to deal with this because the interests held by France in Tianjin are as important as those of Britain. The two governments are maintaining close contact and have decided in principle to take joint action." The right-wing Le Temps stated, "The threat posed by the Japanese military blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin is a scene in the struggle between Japan and the Western countries. A Japanese military spokesman said that even if a solution is found to the current dispute in Tianjin, the friendship between Britain and Japan may not be restored as a result. This statement is noteworthy. It seems that Japan intends for Britain and France to refuse to aid China and abolish the concession system in China. In addition, although Japan has not joined the German-Italian alliance, it does its best to support any initiatives launched by Germany and Italy. It would not be unreasonable to say that this incident was instigated by the German-Italian axis." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, all newspapers highlighted the blockade of Tianjin as the main news, with large headlines, maps, and detailed accounts of the Japanese army's repeated violations of British interests in North China. It is reported that the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin have rejected the British proposal for a joint committee to resolve the Tianjin dispute. Reuters has learned that the Japanese government's reply to the British government takes the attitude that the case is of a local nature and should be resolved locally. It is also learned that the British government is currently closely considering the steps it will take next. Officials are silent on the countermeasures they will take, but have firmly stated that the Japanese blockade is unforgivable and that the British government has no intention of submitting tamely. The British and French governments are currently conducting consultations. It is believed here that the French government will support any plan that the British government deems necessary. Reuters has learned that the U.S. government has ordered the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin to chair the joint committee proposed by the British and to make every effort to mediate and find a solution to the British-Japanese dispute. An authority on Far Eastern affairs told a Reuters reporter today, "We are now adhering purely to moral principles in this issue of extraditing the four Chinese people demanded by the Japanese side. This move will surely arouse goodwill among the Chinese towards the British, while the Japanese hope to make both the British and the Chinese lose face. This move also seems likely to give Americans a good impression." Furthermore, according to responsible sources, the Japanese side clearly intends to use the excuse of refusing to extradite the Chinese people to implement its aggressive plan, the purpose of which is to allow the Japanese to gain economic and financial control of foreign trade in Tianjin. As for the "new order" claimed by the Japanese side, it has so far only proven harmful to British interests, so those foreigners who wish to trade freely with China under existing treaties are not welcome. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>British Newspapers Still Hope for a Diplomatic Solution</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail has recently commented on the situation in Tianjin, China, stating that the matter can be resolved through diplomatic channels. "Japan does not want to cause new disputes in the Far East, and Britain is also busy dealing with European events and also hopes to avoid disputes." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, a diplomatic affairs reporter for the Financial Times recently declared, "The British and American governments have conducted consultations on this matter. The U.S. government has agreed to have its consul-general in Tianjin serve as chairman of the joint British-Japanese committee. In addition, there are three members, including one representative each from the British and American governments. This method of organizing a committee to resolve the difficulties is being sought for approval from the Japanese government. After its establishment, the committee will decide whether the four Chinese currently detained in the British Concession, who are accused by the Japanese of being responsible for several recent assassinations in Tianjin, should be handed over to a court outside the British Concession. Therefore, the Japanese 'threat of blockade may not last.'" (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Refuses to Form an Arbitration Committee</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the demand of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, China, that the British Concession authorities extradite four Chinese, officials here recently stated that the British proposal to form an arbitration committee has been rejected by the Japanese side. Sources close to the Foreign Office stated that this dispute is a pretext used by the Japanese, and that their intention is to pressure foreigners to cooperate with the new regime in North China, thereby controlling the economy and finances of Tianjin.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Actually Implements a Blockade of the British and French Concessions</h3>
<p>From 6:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese army in Tianjin has implemented a blockade of the British and French concessions. This kind of blockade is entirely an act of coercion and humiliation, and naturally there is no legal basis to speak of. The impact of the blockade will be that all industries and businesses based in the British and French concessions of Tianjin will come to a complete standstill; the lives of both Chinese and foreign residents within the concessions will also suffer greatly. This is another chapter in the blatant attacks by Japan on the rights and interests of European and American countries in China since the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Japan's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin this time is under the pretext that the British side refused Japan's demand to extradite the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng; however, the spokesperson of the Japanese army in Tianjin yesterday also stated that even if the British side handed over the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, this problem could not be resolved; unless the British concession authorities cooperate with the Japanese side to jointly establish a "New Order in East Asia" and abandon all policies of aiding the Chinese government. Therefore, the compromise proposed by the British side, namely, to organize a joint committee to discuss the extradition issue together, has also been rejected by the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Analyzing Japan's blockade of the Tianjin concessions this time, there are two points that particularly deserve attention: First, the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin is only a part of Japan's surgical operation to resolve the issue of concessions in China; in the future, concessions in other places may also suffer the same fate. This inference is based on: (1) the statement made yesterday by the spokesperson of the Japanese army in Tianjin; (2) the Kyoto Shimbun previously propagated that Japan's real enemy is not in China, but in the concessions within China; (3) according to the remarks made by Suzuki, the so-called Minister of Political Affairs of the Japan Prosperity Institute yesterday, under Japan's construction of a "New Order", all countries should return the concessions in China; the current concessions hinder the construction of the New Order and are truly hostile acts that Japan can hardly tolerate. These three different expressions very clearly express Japan's intention towards concessions in various places, and its determination to seize them for itself. Now the British and French concessions in Tianjin have already suffered Japan's blockade; and when the British Parliament discussed the Far East issue the other day, it regarded July 7th of this year as the most dangerous date for the Shanghai concessions; at the same time, here in Shanghai, it is also rumored that the Japanese authorities have instructed Japanese residents in the concessions to move to the north of the Suzhou Creek. Although we cannot imagine that Shanghai will one day fall into the same situation as Tianjin, we can at least assert that it is a mistake to regard the concessions as impregnable strongholds and happy lands.</p>
<p>Secondly, recently, an anti-British movement has generally occurred within Japan and in the guerrilla areas of China controlled by the Japanese army; and cases of harm and insult to British officials and civilians in various places are even more numerous; this time the Japanese army's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin seems to be specifically aimed at Britain, so the Japanese consul in Tianjin had previously requested understanding from the consulates of other countries in Tianjin and indicated that the food needed by American residents after the blockade could be supplied by the Japanese side. This kind of action by Japan is undoubtedly a divisive tactic. If Japan wants to complete its New Order, it must first exclude British interests in the Far East, and then exclude the interests of the United States, France, and other countries in the Far East; now Japan is only attacking the British side in Tianjin, and it is by no means abandoning its attempt to exclude the interests of other countries in the Far East, but is afraid of the cooperation of Britain, France, and the United States. It can only temporarily make the anti-American and anti-French work as the second or third step in excluding European and American interests in China.</p>
<p>How can the European and American countries not deeply understand Japan's ambition and intention? It's just that they have not yet taken effective countermeasures. Especially Britain, which is bearing the brunt. Based on past experience, it should be known that this Tianjin incident cannot be resolved by compromise unless Britain is willing to withdraw from the Far East; if it is still believed that this incident is due to the extradition of the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, it would be a great mistake. The British Foreign Secretary said in a speech the other day that he would never recognize the unilateral changes to the various treaties in the Far East, and would do everything possible to defend British interests in China; if he wants to solve this problem by extraditing the suspects, it would be tantamount to tearing up the various treaties in the Far East with his own hands, and cutting off his own interests in China. It should be known that only by using action to stop the actions of aggressors is the most effective way. The Gulangyu incident is an example. According to the telegraphic news from Paris and Washington yesterday, the French and American governments have both stated that their respective navies in the Far East will cooperate with Britain to jointly protect their interests in the Far East. The Tianjin concessions incident may be the most appropriate time to prompt the British and American countries to protect their interests with action!</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Persevering in the War of Resistance, President Kong Expresses His Views, This War of Resistance is a Decisive Battle for the Survival of the Nation, It Will Not Stop Until Japan Abandons Its Aggression</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) President of the Executive Yuan Kong Xiangxi expressed his views on the issue of "Persevering in the War of Resistance, Self-Reliance and Regeneration" at 7:00 PM on the 14th. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Tonight, I will briefly describe to my compatriots across the country the recent political situation of the central government and the current situation of the War of Resistance, and extend my heartfelt condolences and sincere expectations. The War of Resistance has been going on for nearly two years. The suffering and brutality suffered by our compatriots under the hail of bullets are always in the government's thoughts. Since ancient times, there have been many disputes between countries, but in civilized countries, the army, except for taking hostile actions against combatants, never arbitrarily abuses civilians. However, Japanese soldiers have wantonly killed the people of neighboring countries, creating a tragic scene unprecedented in human history. The government feels infinite sorrow for this tragic scene. The reason why it does not shirk hard work, does not avoid the responsibility of leading the people, and endures painful sacrifices is because it has decided that this War of Resistance is the final decisive battle for the survival and continuation of our nation. If we cannot endure the current pain, we will incur the tragic disaster of national subjugation. Therefore, we can only adhere to our position and resist to the end in order to save the nation, survive, revive, and build the country. War is originally a difficult thing. Japan is one of the strongest countries in the world. Our War of Resistance against Japan is fighting the strong with the weak. Engaging in a large-scale war within our own territory means that all sacrifices and pains are unavoidable. Fortunately, under the leadership of the Supreme Leader, the soldiers and civilians across the country have overcome difficulties and become more and more courageous in battle, so that all of the Japanese's strategic and political conspiracies have been shattered. The Japanese, seeing that the military situation is difficult and the environment is dangerous, deeply know that continuing to fight for a long time will cause their country to fall into a state of complete collapse. Recently, they deliberately spread the air of peace, used puppets as their echoers, and tried to induce our compatriots in the lost areas to make calls for peace, attempting to deceive the world and induce our military's morale, in order to end the war as soon as possible and achieve war results through political means. Unfortunately, some people have fallen into the Japanese trap due to being driven by a psychology of fear of difficulty and seeking temporary peace, and have destroyed their own positions and worked for the enemy. This is really a very regrettable thing. Compatriots, in this regard, you should know that the current suffering is the result of our nation's centuries of inaction, laxity, and failure to rejuvenate itself. If we are still afraid of difficulty and seek temporary peace, and are coerced and induced to compromise midway, cutting off the precious foundation that our ancestors left us, the result will inevitably make our descendants suffer the shame of national subjugation for all generations. Therefore, we must abandon our fluke mentality, willingly endure all the pain, "persevere in the War of Resistance, be self-reliant and regenerate." Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to the national revolution, and his goal was to seek freedom and equality for China. This is the legitimate demand of our entire people, and it is also the goal that the government has always worked towards. The Chinese nation has always been known for its love of peace, so the policies of successive governments have always been based on peace. Even when the national strength was at its peak, it never invaded neighboring countries. Japan has the same script and race as us. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, it has repeatedly received our support. Even in modern diplomatic history, all the rights and interests that the great powers can enjoy in our country have been enjoyed by Japan. In recent years, Japan has used various means within our country to obtain many special interests. Our government has endured all kinds of grievances, and its purpose is nothing more than to maintain peace. Unfortunately, Japan's national policy is fundamentally not to coexist with us. In order to strive for the independence and survival of the nation, we cannot but endure all sacrifices and rise up to resist the war. This is a decisive battle between the national policies of China and Japan, and there is an inevitable trend. Our War of Resistance work cannot be stopped until Japan abandons its policy of aggression (to be continued).</p>

<h3>The Chinese Authorities Promulgate "Guidelines for Treating Prisoners of War Favorably", Respecting Their Personality, Providing Them with Preferential Treatment, and Tactfully Guiding Them to Reform</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) China has always valued peace and universal love. Even in this determined War of Resistance, the treatment of prisoners of war is based on the principle of leniency.

<h3>The Communist Newspaper Praises the New Fourth Army, the Strength of Combat is Growing Infinitely, and the Local People Especially Praise Harmony</h3>

The political awareness of all soldiers and commanders has been further enhanced. The political work of the army is also very good. It can maintain close ties with local patriotic groups. At the same time, the local people not only supply the army with material resources, but also help it fight against the Japanese. The New Fourth Army, in conjunction with the national army and the people, will be able to complete the common task of the national liberation war in its activities behind the Japanese army, consume the Japanese in a protracted war, and finally drive out the Japanese and recover the lost land (Tass dispatch on the 12th).</p>

<h3>Franco-Turkish Agreement Progress in Negotiations Ponlae meets the Turkish Ambassador Two Issues Awaiting Consultation</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Ponlae received the Turkish Ambassador Suad this morning to discuss the issue of concluding an agreement between France and Turkey. According to this matter, there are still two points to be considered: one is the protection of French interests within the Sanjak region, and the other is the demarcation between the region and the Syrian Republic. Once the two parties have reached an agreement on these two matters, they will sign two documents: (1) An agreement on the Sanjak issue, which will be signed by the French Ambassador to Turkey together with the Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu; (2) A declaration of mutual assistance between France and Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean, which will be signed in Paris by Foreign Minister Ponlae and Turkish Ambassador Suad.

<h3>American Youths Ridicule Jewish Children</h3>
<p>Swastikas Tattooed on Foreheads - Influenced by Nazi Propaganda</p>
<p>An elementary school student from Baltimore, USA, of Jewish descent, only fourteen years old, was seized today by more than forty rowdy children in a remote alley here. They used a small knife to carve the letter "H" on his neck (H is the first letter of Hebrew, indicating that the child is Jewish). They then used purple ink to print a swastika on his forehead. After being injured, he rushed to the hospital bleeding profusely for treatment. The authorities immediately began an investigation and have arrested eighteen of the offending children. It has also been discovered that there is a youth association here that communicates with the German-American Association, and all its actions are influenced by Nazi propaganda.

<p>Italian-Bulgarian Negotiations Proceeding</p>
<p>Renewal of Clearing Agreement</p>
<p>Capital of Bulgaria: The Bulgarian trade delegation arrived in Rome yesterday to prepare for negotiations with Italy to renew the Italian-Bulgarian clearing agreement. The old agreement is about to expire in the near future. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Balkan Nations Should Unite Romanian Foreign Minister's Earnest Advice Appears Aimed at Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Capital of Turkey: Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, in a speech to reporters today, stated that a Balkan Consultation Pact, including all countries of the Balkan Peninsula, does not discriminate against any country and is not directed at any other country. All those who sympathize with our open-door policy and wish to join the Balkan Consultation are welcome. Our resolute implementation of this policy is not due to a recognition of our weakness. On the contrary, we are determined to strengthen the Consultation Group. Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu shares the same sentiments with me, believing that the unity, independence, and peace of the Balkan countries must be safeguarded. From now on, Romania and Turkey will rely on each other. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Considers Establishing an Intelligence Department</h3>
<p>Provoking Malicious Criticism from the German Press</p>
<p>Described as a Revival of the Northcliffe Policy</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet will meet today to consider a proposal to establish an intelligence department dedicated to handling foreign intelligence, so as to present the British side's reasoning to the world in a more effective manner. The former British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Percy Loraine, will assume an important role in this new agency, as he is well-versed in international affairs and has extensive experience as the former Secretary-General of the League of Nations. If the Cabinet approves this proposal, the department will have a spokesperson. The current planning scope is limited, only for peacetime needs, but in wartime, the scope of operations will need to be expanded. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The proposal to establish an intelligence department in Britain has aroused negative criticism from the German newspapers, describing it as a revival of Lord Northcliffe's manipulative tactics. The Berlin local newspaper stated that this move is a hostile plan directed against Germany. Britain's so-called peace is highly questionable, which is even more evident here. Why is Britain taking this step? It is simply because no one takes seriously the British cabinet members' statement that Britain is prepared to negotiate with Germany. Therefore, Britain wants to interfere more directly in Germany's internal affairs in the name of peace, in addition to the encirclement policy. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Contributions to the Motherland Last Year Cash and Material Donations Totaling 60 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>San Francisco: In 1938, the total contribution of overseas Chinese from all over the United States to the motherland amounted to 60 million yuan, including both cash and materials. This estimate is based on reports from both China and the donation locations. It is said that this remittance has doubled compared to the previous highest figure. A total of 10 million overseas Chinese participated in the remittance, which has greatly benefited the maintenance of China's resistance and foreign exchange. It is reported that the funds donated by overseas Chinese to the Chinese government totaled 120 million yuan, mostly contributed by overseas Chinese in Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines, with the contributions from overseas Chinese in the Western Hemisphere amounting to 27 million yuan. As for other material contributions, there were medicines, ambulances, etc. At the same time, hundreds of experts trained abroad have also returned to China to serve. As for individuals, Hu Wenhu stands out. Not only did Mr. Hu donate money and medicines to the country, but he also invested 50 million yuan in Southwest enterprises.

<h3>Hungarian Regent Explains Diplomatic Policy Maintaining Independence as a Goal Maintaining Friendly Relations with Neighboring Countries</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Regent Horthy delivered a speech in the House of Representatives today, discussing diplomatic issues. He stated that Hungary is determined to safeguard its independence and freedom, maintain faith with all friendly countries, and is willing to establish new friendships. Our country has harmonious relations with Germany and Italy, and the relationship with Poland is also very friendly, inherited through generations, and unshakable. As for Yugoslavia, the relationship between us is based on mutual trust and should be promoted at every opportunity. In short, Hungary seeks only peace. After the major powers have resolved their own issues, the issues related to various small countries should be submitted for discussion. It would also be acceptable if the Pope presided over this matter. Regarding internal affairs, he said that the government's policy should focus on agricultural and social reform.

<h3>Germany Expands Military Preparations Heavy Taxes People's Grievances</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Finance Minister Reinhardt, in response to frequent complaints from the business community about heavy taxes, specifically explained the reasons why taxes cannot be reduced at a meeting of merchants today. He said that if Germany's military preparations were carried out over many years, the costs could indeed be lower. However, last year, other countries might have inflicted war on Germany. If so, the cost of war would be many times greater than the cost of military preparations. It is estimated that tax revenue this year will reach 22,000,000,000 marks, compared to 18,000,000,000 marks in 1938 and 7,000,000,000 marks in 1932. It is predicted that revenue in 1940 will be higher than in 1939. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>US Foreign Policy Association's Prediction on World War II Britain and France to Receive Full US Assistance Global Economic Power to Further Concentrate in the United States</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the US Foreign Policy Association's prediction, the outcome of a second European war will inevitably create an orderly new world. There will be some changes in European democracies, while the United States will occupy a dominant position in the Western Hemisphere and the Far East. This prediction is part of a report by the association's economic expert, Mr. Kress. According to Mr. Kress, "In the second European war, the United States will still strictly maintain neutrality, but Britain and France will be able to obtain sufficient gold and other assistance from the United States, which can support the war for at least two years. However, if the war extends to more than two years, all countries may permanently abandon gold as the basis of their currency system. In short, as a result of the United States maintaining neutrality, the economic power of all countries will inevitably further concentrate in the United States. Also, as a result of the war, the world will inevitably be divided into two major parts. On the one hand, all belligerent countries will adopt economic systems similar to those of the Soviet Union and Germany. The neutral countries of Europe will inevitably integrate their economic lives with those of the belligerent countries. On the other hand, other countries, under the leadership of the United States, will become a free international economic base." (Associated Press News Agency, 13th)</p>

<h3>Strang Arrives in Moscow British-Soviet Negotiations Resume Baltic States Guarantee Issue Soviet Union Still Insists on Original Position</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Sterndale Bennet, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, leading a team to assist the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, in negotiating the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, arrived here from Warsaw at 11:00 AM today. Rooth, Director of the Western European Department of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, a representative of the Protocol Department, Bonikov, and Counsellor Fanlig of the British Embassy were all at the station to welcome them. It is reported that Sterndale Bennet will meet with Ambassador Seeds tomorrow to begin talks with Foreign Minister Molotov. At that time, the First Deputy Foreign Minister, Potemkin, will serve as interpreter. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) On the eve of the arrival of Sterndale Bennet, the special representative of the British Foreign Office, bringing instructions regarding the Anglo-Franco-Soviet anti-aggression pact to Ambassador Seeds, the Soviet government's mouthpiece, "Pravda," commented on the negotiations to be held today, still insisting that Latvia, Estonia, and Finland must accept the Soviet guarantee, stating that the neutrality of the Baltic states is crucial to the security of the Soviet Union. These three countries are unable to resist aggression, so they need a guarantee from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The attitudes of Estonian Foreign Minister Selter and Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko, who oppose the Soviet guarantee, are likely due to German incitement. If so, what we are encountering is an understanding or conspiracy to destroy the defensive line of anti-aggression countries. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) According to today's "Daily Express," a joint declaration by Britain, France, and Poland on the status of Danzig will be issued soon. It is reported that Sterndale Bennet, the Director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, discussed this matter with the British Ambassador to Poland during his visit to Warsaw on his way to Moscow. Informed sources believe that Britain, France, and Poland will submit a proposal to Germany regarding changing the status of Danzig in the near future, but it can be asserted that the proposal will definitely not be to return Danzig to Germany.

<p>Switzerland Decides to Resume Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Swiss Capital: The House of Representatives recently passed a motion with 70 votes in favor and 33 votes against, supporting Switzerland's resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. (A Soviet diplomat was assassinated in Switzerland several years ago, and the two sides immediately severed diplomatic relations until now.) Foreign Minister Motta then delivered a speech, stating that the government will conduct an impartial study of this issue, but members should not expect to obtain broad trade benefits immediately after the country recognizes the Soviet government.

<h3>German-Italian Coddling of Spain London Quite Anxious Preliminary Success in Italian-Spanish Treaty Negotiations Ciano Scheduled to Visit Spain Next Month</h3>
<p>(London) The relationship between Spain and the German-Italian axis is gradually becoming closer. The fact that the Spanish Interior Minister Suner visited Rome, and the Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will visit Spain next month in return, and that General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, is also said to visit Rome at the end of September, can serve as evidence. Government insiders here are quite anxious. According to reliable sources, Spain signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression with Germany and Italy respectively at the end of March, on the eve of Spain's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, stipulating that they would not aid each other's enemies in wartime. Now, Germany and Italy are trying to urge General Franco to sign a closer agreement, which is supported by Spanish Interior Minister Suner, but most people in the Spanish government oppose it. It is likely that this matter will not be decided before General Franco visits Italy at the end of September. If Spain is determined to join the German-Italian axis at that time, the international situation will inevitably become more dangerous again. Fortunately, Spain's relationship with Britain is still friendly and without gaps, and its relationship with France is also expected to improve, so that Britain can engage in diplomatic activities to strengthen the position of those in the Spanish government who oppose joining the German-Italian axis. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Spanish Interior Minister Suner returned to his country by plane today. It is reported that as a result of Suner's visit to Italy, the two sides have established a cultural agreement. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to people close to the Italian government, the talks conducted by Interior Minister Suner are only preliminary in nature, for exchanging opinions on the conclusion of a cultural and economic agreement between Italy and Spain. Once Foreign Minister Ciano travels to that country in mid-next month, the negotiations can be completed, and the formal signing ceremony will be held when General Franco comes here for a visit at the end of September. In short, the friendly relationship between that country and the German-Italian axis is becoming increasingly close, which is gratifying. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Rumor that Hitler Will Launch a New Violent Coup Germany Says It Does Not Intend to Change the Current System in Slovakia</h3>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Herald" wrote today that he expects Hitler to implement a new violent coup within a few days, that is, German troops will occupy Slovakia and incorporate it as Germany's third protectorate. German troops have already entered some parts of Slovakia according to the Deschner Agreement, and Slovakia cannot resist. Germany seems to have suggested to Hungary that if Hungary cedes a narrow strip of territory west of the Labe River to Germany, it will receive a larger piece of Slovak territory as a reward. The correspondent believes that Hungary has firmly refused to agree. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Rumors that Germany will mobilize troops to the border of the Slovak State have recently been earnestly denied by responsible parties, who said that Germany has no intention of changing the current system in the Slovak State. (The Slovak State is currently placed under German protection.) (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>

<h3>US House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes Neutrality Act Amendment Abolishing Ban on Arms Exports</h3>
<p>(Washington) The House Foreign Affairs Committee recently continued its meeting today to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment. It immediately passed the amendment proposed by Chairman Bloom with twelve votes in favor and eight votes against. All twelve Democratic committee members voted in favor, while all eight Republican committee members voted against. According to Bloom, the House of Representatives can vote on this bill as soon as it is discussed on the 16th of this month. The points of the Bloom bill are as follows: (1) The current Neutrality Act prohibits lending money to belligerent countries, prohibits holding fundraisers for those countries, and prohibits warships of those countries from using US ports to refuel and resupply. All three of these amendments will be retained. (2) The current arms export supervision measures will also be implemented as usual. (3) The ban on arms exports will be abolished. (4) Various goods transported to belligerent countries should transfer ownership to foreign buyers before export. (5) Authorize the President to designate war zones and prohibit American citizens or ships from entering them. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday passed the new Neutrality Act bill, despite the obstruction of isolationists in the Senate. Thus, Secretary of State Hull's proposal has achieved good results. Yesterday, the members of the House committees expressed their attitudes according to their party's positions, with a vote ratio of twelve to eight. The decision will abolish the existing embargo on arms. Once the President specifies the scope of the war zone, American merchant ships and citizens will not be allowed to enter the war zone. It is said that the bill also stipulates regulations for goods transported to belligerent countries. In the future, the ownership of all goods should be transferred to foreign buyers before the goods are loaded, so that the US government authorities will not bear the responsibility for protecting transportation. President Roosevelt announced the definition of "weapons, ammunition, and implements of war" on May 1 of this year, and the committee has now adopted this definition and has further prohibited American merchant ships from entering belligerent countries after being armed. The new bill will still prohibit American citizens from lending money and extending credit to belligerent countries, but the President may modify this situation in order to "protect the business and other interests of American citizens," so that the American people can still lend commercial loans and short-term loans to belligerent countries. The President should publicly report on such exceptions, with the publication period being once per quarter. In addition, it will strictly restrict belligerent countries from attracting money and absorbing funds in the United States. According to the bill, the existing Arms Management Department will continue to exist. The President will order restrictions on foreign submarines and armed merchant ships from using American seaports, but the provisions of the Neutrality Act will never be applied to other countries in the Americas. According to the Vice Chairman of the Committee (Democratic Congressman from New York), Mr. Bloom, the bill should be submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion within two weeks.

<h3>Last Month Gold Imported into the US Valued at Over 400 Million Yuan</h3>

<h3>Japan Imports Large Quantities of Iron Sand</h3>
<p>British Malaya Supplies 250,000 Tons Per Month</p>
<p>Singapore: Japan imports nearly 250,000 tons of iron sand from British Malaya every month. Exports to Japan in April totaled 235,259 tons, 75,351 tons in March, 30,902 tons in February, 43,698 tons in January, and 113,434 tons in April last year. The number of shipments to Japan in the first three months of each year is usually low because most of the iron sand supply comes from Kelantan and Trengganu, and during this period, loading on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula is often hindered by seasonal winds and weather. Of the iron sand shipped to Japan in April, 73,759 tons came from Sungei Lembing, 68,040 tons came from Kelantan, and 93,460 tons came from Trengganu. The mines producing this iron sand are all owned by the Japanese, and most of the workers are Japanese and Indians. Chinese workers stopped working after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War.

<h3>Polish Economic Envoys Arrived in London Yesterday Negotiating Credit Loans for Expanding Military Preparations</h3>
<p>(London) The Polish economic delegation, led by Colonel Kok, the government's financial advisor and director of the Bank of Poland, arrived here today to earnestly negotiate with the British government on obtaining export credit loans to purchase various military equipment. At the same time, the country's military delegation, led by Air Force Chief of Staff General Rayski, will also come here this weekend. Regarding this matter, responsible parties stated that after the British military delegation investigated the military needs in Poland, they submitted a report advocating that a huge sum of 60 million pounds be loaned to the country for expanding military preparations. However, the British Treasury Department believes that this amount is too large and intends to grant export credit loans in the same manner as Turkey (the credit loans granted by Britain to Turkey totaled 16 million pounds). The Polish government then proposed a compromise solution, that is, Britain would supply a large number of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns, and the ownership would still belong to Britain. If war breaks out in the future, these aircraft can still be piloted by British pilots, so as to form a joint air force in Eastern Europe. The Polish military delegation is coming to Britain to continue discussing this matter and to select suitable military equipment for the country's army. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Panic over Food and Fuel in Guangzhou: Guangzhou Cut Off from Neighboring Counties, Japanese Military Conducts Household Registration, More Residents Leaving the City</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Since its fall, Guangzhou has become a dead city. Its connection with neighboring counties has been severed, hindering freight transport and disrupting the economy. This has forced the people within the city to live without any means of support. The Japanese military arbitrarily inspects and extracts resources, placing the citizens in a situation where both laughter and tears are inappropriate. This policy contradicts their proclaimed "prosperity policy." For instance, the recent farce of a "business resumption movement" jointly staged by the Japanese military and the puppet regime saw a puppet chamber of commerce president enticing closed shop owners to reopen, but few responded. According to a recent survey, the number of reopened shops in the entire city is no more than three hundred, and most of these are small food shops and second-hand goods stalls. The capital of each shop is mostly less than a thousand yuan, and some only have tens of yuan. Besides these, the only businesses open are Japanese commercial firms. Many of these firms are located on Yide Road in the city, some engaging in wholesale, others in retail. Wholesale mainly involves seafood, grains, and textiles, while retail mainly consists of cafes and daily necessities stores.</p>
<p>Guangzhou's grain supply usually relies on rice from counties such as Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, and Zhongshan. In lean years, it depends on imported white rice from Annam and Siam. Since Guangzhou fell last October, the rice-producing areas of Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, and Zhongshan have been ravaged by Japanese cavalry. Farmers have abandoned their fields, and grain seeds are exhausted. This year's early crops have left the fields barren. Therefore, since the beginning of summer, not a single dan (unit of weight) of local rice has been imported into Guangzhou. What is sold in the market is all foreign rice transported by the Japanese military. Demand exceeds supply, and rice prices have soared. Currently, one yuan can only buy four jin (unit of weight) and eight liang of foreign rice. For the survivors after the disaster, food has become a major problem, and the poor, weak, and elderly have no way to survive. As a result, people are starving to death on the streets. The coolie class all look malnourished, and the young and strong are moving to other places to seek food. Therefore, in the past eight months, 80% to 90% of households in the city have stopped cooking. Not only is grain as precious as pearls, but even firewood is as rare as cassia. In the past, Guangzhou's fuel completely relied on firewood transported from the east and west rivers, with one yuan buying 60 to 80 jin. Since the entire city was looted last year, the stored firewood has been exhausted. At the same time, the east and west rivers were blockaded, and firewood boats could not transport goods. As a result, the source of firewood was cut off. For several months, the fuel used by residents has been entirely the beams and pillars dismantled from houses and sold by bandits. However, this old timber also costs 40 jin per yuan, and sometimes there is no supply at all.</p>
<p>Vegetables and meat are also twice as expensive as before. Pork sells for one yuan and eight jiao per jin, and roasted meat sells for two yuan per jin, and they are often out of stock. This is because pigs are purchased by peddlers at the risk of their lives from suburban villages, and these villages do not necessarily have pigs for sale, as the Japanese military's goal is to plunder pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks wherever they go.</p>
<p>The Japanese military has been unable to maintain public order in Guangzhou, so they have adopted harsh measures, implementing so-called household registration checks, causing the residents who remain in the city to be unable to bear the abuse and leave the city in droves. The Japanese military's previous appeasement policy has now yielded contradictory results. The so-called household registration check method involves first listing the name, number, age, and occupation of each male and female resident on a wooden plaque and hanging it in front of the door for the puppet police to check at any time. If there is any suspicion during the check, they are immediately arrested. In areas where household registration checks are carried out, residents are not allowed to go out after 10 pm. If friends or relatives visit, they must report to the puppet police station before 6 pm every day, otherwise they will be regarded as harboring bandits. Residents must also be universally vaccinated. As soon as this regulation was issued, the residents had no peace. Many Japanese soldiers are stationed in Henan, Guangzhou, so the precautions are stricter than elsewhere. The Hongde and Haitong districts of Henan are now designated to start implementation.

<h3>Current Situation of Joint Land and Water Transport in Chaozhou and Meizhou: Garrison Headquarters Manages Boats and Vehicles</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Recently, Japanese warships have been gathering in the sea off Shantou. On the 7th, four Japanese warships, along with twenty armed fishing boats, patrolled between Huilai Shenquan and Aojiao to spy. However, there are ten miles of salt fields on the coast of Aojiao, making it difficult for the Japanese army to land. Therefore, the Japanese warships lingered for four hours, sent out planes for reconnaissance, and sailed east after nightfall. On the 8th, three more Japanese warships, twelve electric boats, and wooden rafts and bamboo rafts gathered on the sea off Houzhai, Nan'ao, and sent a plane to scout the north and south ports of Chenghai, but did not drop bombs. At this time, more than half of the residents of Shantou City have moved away. Martial law was implemented from the evening of the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, armed military police cooperated to stand guard and check pedestrians. There were no daytime or night markets in the city. Six thousand workers who dismantled the railway worked day and night, and the dismantled steel rails were transported to other places by wooden rafts. Therefore, outside the four suburbs of Shantou, transportation has changed. Once out of Shantou, it relies entirely on boats. The Shantou Garrison Headquarters has specially set up a "Chaozhou and Shantou Joint Land and Water Transport Office" to prevent boatmen from arbitrarily extorting refugees. All sailboats capable of carrying 50 dan are organized into teams and managed by the military. No agencies or groups are allowed to arbitrarily seal off ships. Officials and merchants employ them equally. All vehicles and laborers must also register and form teams at the joint transport office and be directed and dispatched by the office. Refugees, refugee children, and poor people with evacuation certificates can ride boats and vehicles to Chaozhou and Meizhou for free. The second batch of 180 refugee children from Hong Kong who passed through Shantou to Shaozhou the day before yesterday took a boat from Shantou to Chao'an, transferred to Songkou, and then walked to Shaoguan. Moreover, walking to Shaozhou is currently safer than boats and vehicles, because Japanese planes frequently come to Meizhou and Xingning to偵察 and drop bombs, specifically targeting boats and vehicles, opening fire and扫射 passengers. For example, at 9 am on the 5th, after a Japanese plane flew to Meixian to drop bombs, it opened fire on the traffic liner traveling between Songkou and Chao'an. The liner was sailing downstream from Songkou that day. After passing Sanheba, it was attacked by a Japanese plane. Two passengers were killed in the cabin, and four or five were injured. The ship quickly pulled alongside the shore to allow passengers to disembark and hide. After the Japanese plane left, it returned to traffic and rushed to Chao'an. According to people from Meixian who came to Shantou, seven bombs were dropped on Meixian city that day. Two bombs did not explode. The county high school inside the South Gate, the Li Family Ancestral Hall (Si'e Ancestral Hall), the Lingfeng Building outside the South Gate, and the Lan Yuanyu and Li Lisheng gold shops were all destroyed. Several people were killed or injured. The population of various cities in Chaozhou and Shantou is evacuated, and now they all rely on walking. According to traffic indicators, a station is set up every 30 li. Refugee children and women walk leisurely, walking two stations a day to reach a safe area.</p>

<h3>Sichuan-Kang Science Expedition Departs, Has Set Off from Jiading, Divided into Three Phases of Investigation</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Education Implements Health Education, Scouting, and Military Training, Health Education Has Been Conducted in Seventeen Provinces and Cities, Scouting Education Improves Three-Level Curriculum, School Military Training Closely Connected with Educational Administration</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Dispatch) The Ministry of Education's implementation of health education, scouting education, and school military training is summarized below:</p>
<p>Health Education</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 18</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health (now renamed the Department of Health) jointly announced regulations on health examinations for school students and other laws and regulations, and held the first national health education workshop in Shanghai to train teachers and administrative staff to promote the implementation of laws and regulations. After the Medical Education Committee was established in the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Middle and Small School Health Education Design Committee was organized to succeed it and was attached to the Medical Education Committee. In the 24th year, the Ministry of Education ordered all provinces and cities to organize health education committees and designated school personnel to manage school health affairs. Before the War of Resistance, the provinces and cities that carried out health education included Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and the Weihaiwei Administrative Region.</p>
<p>Scouting Education</p>
<p>Scouting is originally</p>
<p>A method of supplementary education in schools, led and managed by the General Association of Chinese Scouts. In order to make education more closely related to life, the Ministry of Education, in addition to improving school education methods, has stipulated since the 23rd year that Scouting is a compulsory course for junior high schools and schools of equal level. The number of scout troops nationwide has greatly increased. In the autumn of the 25th year, a national scout review and jamboree was held, with excellent results. During this period of resistance and national reconstruction, the work of youth training is of great importance. In addition to urging junior high schools across the country to implement it earnestly, the Ministry of Education plans to organize a committee to conduct a detailed review of the original three-level curriculum to improve it to meet the needs of the times.</p>
<p>School Military Training</p>
<p>School student military</p>
<p>Affairs training began in the 18th year and is a compulsory subject for students in high schools and above. Initially, there was only peacetime training in school. Later, in order to allow students to gain more practical military life and economy, concentrated training was added from the 23rd year, with provinces and cities as units. The period for high schools is three months (vocational schools can be reduced to 40 days to two months), and the period for junior colleges and above is two months. The purpose of military training is to provide various training in spirit, life, physique, and skills to complete national and reserve sergeant education. All teaching methods and textbook content are presided over by the former Training Directorate and the current Political Department of the Military Commission. Instructors are also selected by the Political Department and appointed by the Ministry of Education. According to past situations, difficulties in equipment and personnel have been heard from time to time, and the ideal goals have not been achieved. The Ministry of Education is closely liaising with the Political Department to strive for the enrichment and rationality of teaching content, the improvement of instructor training and appointment, and the solution of time and equipment issues.</p>

<h3>Finance: Profit-Taking Bulls Emerge, Cash Reverses, Falling Below the 2,600 Yuan Mark, A Small Correction After Seven Consecutive Days of Gains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Red cash market started with a sluggish tone, then rose, and finally fell again, seemingly shifting with buying and selling forces. The morning opening was pressed down to 2,600 yuan because a certain gold firm continued to liquidate positions on behalf of speculators. Subsequently, although a certain gold firm continued to sell, a certain money exchange firm showed vigorous interest, once pushing the price up to 620 yuan. Later, because securities firms, acting on behalf of northern merchant bulls, tended to sell, and general floating bulls also followed suit to cash in profits, the market, although a certain gold firm (acting on behalf of speculators) seized the opportunity to re-enter, still felt supply exceeded demand. As a result, the market price broke below the 2,600 yuan mark, once falling to a low of 2,520 yuan. Finally, a certain gold firm still had strong bullish sentiment and entered on dips, stabilizing the market. The market closed at 2,585 yuan, down 35 yuan from the previous day. Trading was still active, reaching around 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold also fell by 3 yuan, Customs gold remained stable, and Chinese and English pure gold both declined slightly.</p>
<p>Shanghai Red Drops 35 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, for each bar (ten taels), the opening saw a certain gold firm's speculator still keen to exit positions, initially bidding 2,615 yuan, but buyers were reluctant, so the price was gradually lowered. The market opened 20 yuan lower at 9:30 AM. A certain gold firm sold 50 taels to a money exchange firm at 2,600 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange firm's buying was quite good, so the gold firm raised prices to meet demand, and the market moved upward, once rising to 620 yuan. Later, retail investors took advantage of the high prices to sell, returning to a downward trend. Money exchange firms traded 50 taels among themselves, lowering the price to 605 yuan. At that time, northern merchants suddenly entrusted securities firms to tend to exit positions, and the market price became more unsustainable, breaking below the 600 yuan mark. However, a certain gold firm seized the opportunity to raise prices and re-enter, and retail investors also showed some interest. Several hundred taels were traded in between, falling sharply to 575 yuan. Later, northern merchant selling interest weakened, and a certain gold firm's speculator continued to absorb, returning the price to 595 yuan. At that time, securities firms came to sell aggressively again, and the trend returned to a downward direction, once retreating to a low of 570 yuan. Extending to noon, it suddenly turned firm again. A certain gold firm bought 50 taels from a money exchange firm at 585 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because securities firms continued to sell, the opening was 5 yuan lower. First, the securities firm sold 90 taels to the gold firm at 580 yuan. Then, the money exchange firm bought 10 taels of cash from the gold firm at 81 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold firm and money exchange firm competed to absorb, the underlying trend was upward, leaping more than 10 yuan. Gold firms traded 50 taels among themselves at 594 yuan. Later, money exchange firms traded 50 taels among themselves at 591 yuan. The money exchange firm bought 50 taels of cash from the gold firm at 593 yuan. At 3:40 PM, the jewelry firm sold 50 taels to the money exchange firm, and the price returned to 585 yuan. After that, a certain layman suddenly entrusted a certain silver firm to suddenly absorb, so sellers were hesitant. Although the price was raised to beyond the 590 yuan mark, selling interest was still weak, extending to 4 PM without any transactions. So, the closing was still 2,585 yuan, resulting in a drop of 35 yuan compared to the day before, which was a correction of 526 yuan after seven consecutive days of gains. The high-low range for the whole day was 50 yuan. The cash offered price was 10 yuan higher than the Shanghai Red price. The spot gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no trading was opened.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Drops 3 Yuan</p>
<p>Jewelry gold, for each tael sold, initially the major firms still quoted 266 yuan. By around 10 AM, when news came that Shanghai Red had suddenly fallen, breaking into the 2,600 yuan mark, they also quoted 3 yuan lower. After that, the Shanghai Red trend became sideways, with no change heard. The major firms changed the quote to 263 yuan, new firms to 261 yuan, and buying in at 255 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Falls One Penny</p>
<p>London, 13th: English pure gold fell by one penny per ounce due to the strength of the pound, falling to £7 8s 4 7/8d. The Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price also decreased to 1,210 yuan and 90 cents. The listed Customs gold remained fixed at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 7 jiao, totaling 1,206 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Arbitrageurs Sell Forward and Buy Spot, Resulting in Supply Exceeding Demand, Swap Spreads Narrow, Market Sentiment Softens</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: HSBC announced the exchange rates, with no changes in British, American, Dutch, and Lv rates, and slight contractions in others. In the black market, the spot prices for British and American currencies showed a slight tightening trend in stability due to the large number of settlements by foreign firms and the slight settling by Chinese merchants. The results were unchanged. As for futures, since a certain party's activity had been tight the day before, Sino-Western arbitrageurs came in droves, buying spot and selling forward. In addition, the buying force of a certain party weakened, and supply slightly exceeded demand, causing the market to soften slightly. Swap spreads have narrowed. The spot and June British gold spread narrowed by 0.03125, and the US dollar spread remained at 0.0625. The June and July spreads remained at 0.09375 for British currencies and 0.1875 for US currencies. However, arbitrageurs can only enter British gold at 0.078125 and US dollars at 0.15625. According to the above calculation, the interest rate (excluding commissions) is about 1.23%. Trading was quiet in the first half of the day. The Hong Kong dollar once hardened to 43.5 yuan due to increased selling interest, but then recovered to 0.25 after money exchange firms and foreign firms successively absorbed it.</p>
<p>Spot Exchange Rates Unchanged</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the London cable showed near and far terms up 0.0625, the New York silver price remained stable, and London gold fell by one penny.

At the time, the July selling price for British currencies was 6 jiao 3.125 fen and for US currencies was 12 yuan 3.125 fen, unchanged from the previous close. After the opening, although foreign firms were busy with settlements, the market was quite stable due to the willingness of outsiders to supply. Foreign firms first settled HSBC and Hua Bi spot British gold at 6 jiao 5 fen and 6 jiao 4.6875 fen. When HSBC announced its rates, the French rate was down slightly by 2 francs, the Hong Kong rate down 0.125, the Singapore rate down 0.125, the Indian rate down 0.125, and the German rate down slightly by 0.125. The Japanese rate was also down 0.25. The rest, such as British, American, Dutch, and Lv rates, were unchanged. At the same time, the silver equalization tax increased by 0.25, totaling 4.00%. Subsequently, foreign merchant banks absorbed Hua Bi spot US dollars at 12 yuan 6 jiao 2.5 fen, and July terms at 12 yuan 3 jiao 1.25 fen. Later, foreign merchant banks traded July British gold at 6 jiao 3.125 fen. At that time, Chinese merchants also settled Hua Bi spot British gold at 6 jiao 4.6875 fen. As the futures market saw high interest rates, wealthy Sino-Western businessmen absorbed spot and sold forward. In addition, a certain party had little activity, and supply slightly exceeded demand, with the situation gradually hardening. Near noon, foreign firms and money exchange firms competed to absorb spot Hong Kong dollars, but as outsiders were willing to sell, the situation was slightly harder. Outsiders, including Andar and Datong, successively sold to money exchange firms and foreign firms, with prices hardening from 43 yuan 2.5 fen to 0.5 yuan, then softening to 0.375. Extending to the noon closing, banks' spot selling prices were 6 jiao 5 fen for British currencies and 12 yuan 6 jiao 2.5 fen for US currencies, almost unchanged from the morning opening. As a result, there were no changes compared to the previous close, but the July futures selling price was 6 jiao 3.75 fen for British gold and 12 yuan 4 jiao 3.75 fen for US dollars, softening 0.0625 for British rates and hardening 0.125 for US rates compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong dollar, calculated based on the transaction price, hardened by 0.25. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Changes Slightly</p>

<p>Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Slightly, British Gold Notes Still Rise Five Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold fell half a penny, and the British-US exchange rate was unchanged. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms had many settlements, and banks' supply was smooth, with a very stable market price. When Shanghai Red opened, the wealthy were keen to supply, and the market situation was weak, 20 yuan lower than the previous day.

<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Drop Slightly, Public Bonds Dip Slightly</h3>
<p>The securities black market: the market situation yesterday: because the rising momentum was too high, there was a slight correction, but the bulls were still pushing up, and some of the bulls liquidated positions. In fact, large institutional bulls were too crowded, and released slightly. Foreign currency call loans were too expensive and were not worthwhile, and foreign exchange arbitrage had a monthly interest of 1.5%, so capitalists gave this up and took that. However, the market sentiment had changed, and the other categories were all small when the market closed, only Category C was unchanged, that is also the situation where the bulls were pushing up the price. The past events yesterday: the opening market price was slightly soft, and the entire market had stronger selling pressure. Lianhe, Tiansheng, Yongkang, and Datong of the 13th and 42nd had all sold, and the buying momentum was weaker. Xingyuan, Tongshun, and Tongkang and other firms' intake was not enthusiastic, and the 20th sold out slightly, causing people's hearts to be distracted. The afternoon was still not boosted, the 42nd and Lianhe continued to sell, and Yongkang, Yuyuan, and Songmao all sold, and most of the buyers were retail investors short covering and bulls propping up the price, and the market sentiment was sluggish, and the closing was early.

The total number of transactions was more than 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: fifty shares of China National Products Company stock were traded, and the price was 23 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The stock market opening of the Public Industry Association had very active selling, which seemed to be the tense atmosphere of the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin. Transaction prices continued to decrease, but after the intake until the closing, the situation seemed to have a correction, and several stocks also had slight progress. Qiahe shares seemed to be the most hit, opening at 21 yuan and 8 jiao, with a few transactions, and then fell directly to 20 yuan and 9 jiao, which was very smooth intake at that price.

<h3>Grains: Flour Prices Increase, Reaching 4 Yuan and 8 Jiao, Wheat Market Tightens</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market situation: prices increased step by step. Since the price increase started by Japan on Thursday of last week, although there has been no violent surge, the opening price has risen and seems to have no end. The factory believes that the rising trend is insufficient and refuses to sell in large quantities. The small amount of recovered goods floating on the market has also been absorbed by hoarding households, so the market has become increasingly strong. It was heard that high-brand foreign flour still required a bidding price of 5 yuan, while ordinary brands sold for 4 yuan 7 jiao and a half, also up 5 fen from before. The No. 2 flour factory's order uniformly rose to 4 yuan 8 jiao for remittances, but transactions were not smooth, because customers' hoarding appetite was good, but the factory's supply was still limited as a careful measure. Today, 12,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tanggu, Tianjin, and 2,500 bags are being shipped to Shantou.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the source of new wheat had slightly arrived, all goods from the Shanghai-Nanjing road area. It was heard that Changshu new wheat also had a few scattered arrivals at the port. This year, because the weather was drier, the wheat grains were dry. At this time, the price of foreign wheat was expensive, and people's hearts were bullish, which aroused the attention of general hoarding households. It was heard that there were many secretly buying, resulting in a tight market, but the needs of Chinese factories were still silent, and Japanese merchants' intake was also slack, so formal transactions remained steady. Yesterday, the street office bought 65 bags of Kunshan new wheat, and the price was still 6 yuan and 8 fen.</p>
<p>Hoarding Households Active, Rice Prices Continue to Rise by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Dugeng Rice: Yesterday, each merchant source arrived from the riverbank, a total of 3,000+ bags of Nan Gang 1-2, wheeled Juzi, Tongkun and other merchants. Due to clear and dry weather, the appetites of the local street and hoarding households continued to be good, and merchants continued to do well, so the market became lively again. Each good opened higher prices, such as Changgao Geng which was opening at 19 yuan and 4 jiao, a rise of 4-5 jiao compared to the previous market. Only Su Tong Geng, with a weaker body, was more than one yuan short, but it also rose 4 jiao plus change. Bo Dao, which had previously opened at 18 yuan, opened at 18 yuan and a half yesterday.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Rice: Since the Wuhu report increased, the daily arrival head has gradually decreased, and after the daily decrease from 5-6 thousand bags to 2-3 thousand bags, the first layer source has decreased. Therefore, the cargo side's thoughts were more upward. Yesterday, the mainland merchants' intake was light, and the shop consumption of the local street was also slack, but hoarding households instead made up for it, so transactions still reached 6,500-6,600 bags, and the price rose by 4-5-6 jiao. Nanjing Xian opened at 16 yuan and a half, and Wuhu Gao Xian also required 16 yuan and 2-3 jiao. As for Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian, it also followed the Geng market and increased by 3-4 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: There are still 8-9 thousand bags in stock, but they are all in the hands of industry hoarders. Because rice prices have soared in recent days, they have all held firm and have not released. After the Saigon opening at 20 yuan and 4 jiao the day before, there were immediately inquiries at 20 yuan and 6-7 jiao that night. Yesterday, the cargo owner actually asked for a price of 21 yuan per jiao, so it was difficult to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice: The current sales of rice cakes and ziba are slightly mobile, but other things are not very smooth. Yesterday, the market Gao Bai and other were opened at 21 yuan and 2 jiao to 20 yuan, and the market was similar, better three or four jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Transactions Slightly Increase</h3>

<h3>Coal: Indian Coal Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Since the changes in the exchange market, the price of Robbie tickets for Indian bituminous coal has risen sharply, and the cost is relevant, and the price has been called up 4 yuan. Yesterday, the market demanded more than it supplied, the cargo owner was smart and charming, the black market continued to be 2 yuan higher, and the industry price was 46 yuan per ton of Indian screened coal, and only allowed 5 tons and 10 tons, and the wholesale was not supplied, so the door houses and shops rose with the tide and had to increase slightly, and each big mixed sale was 6 yuan.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Gold Price Drops, Cotton Yarn Buyers Hesitant, 20-count Double Horse Down 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market, which had been soaring for days, has now reversed and fallen. Market rumors are gradually subsiding. Foreign exchange rates remain stable, hovering around 6.5. All unsubstantiated claims have collapsed on their own. Gold prices have also softened. At the same time, actual sales remain sluggish. The market has announced a decline. However, a certain yarn firm, Feng, has a large amount of cotton yarn of various brands on hand, usually stockpiling three to four thousand bales as a base, selling on the market when prices rise and buying when prices fall. Since the reduction in remittances, general retail investors have seen prices fluctuate by more than seventy yuan. Some are content and have already sold their holdings, but the majority believe that the big gains will be followed by minor pullbacks, and that there is still potential for further price increases.</p>
<p>The opening price of spot yarn this morning was due to the large amount held by bulls. Everyone has a few bales of goods in hand. In addition, bankers have been very active in the spot market recently. Thus, morale is good. Everyone believes that the goods they have bought are valuable and they can rest easy. Consequently, it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. Asking prices remain unchanged. The price of 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods is 498 yuan, and warehouse receipts are 487 yuan. After a while, the situation was sluggish and sellers were slightly more prevalent, saying that foreign exchange was firm and gold prices were falling. Buyers were hesitant and prices gradually declined. In an instant, the spot price of Double Horse fell by 12 yuan, to 486 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 481 yuan. Then, the bullish side slightly bought in a few bales and prices rose again. At the close, the spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 489 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 484 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that Japanese yarn had suddenly fallen by 5 yuan. The price of Double Horse warehouse receipts was 479 yuan, and the spot price was also 486 or 487 yuan. Then, Feng Yarn Firm bought in a few more bales, and prices improved immediately, with momentum tightening. At the close, the price of Double Horse warehouse receipts was 484 yuan, and the spot price was 488 yuan. In the end, various firms bought a total of 2,030 bales. The market prices fell by 10 yuan for 20-count Double Horse, 8 yuan for Five Blessings, 12 yuan for Shepherd, 27 yuan for Special Golden City, and 11 yuan for Double Globe. Today, 645 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 690 bales to Shantou, and 100 bales to Haiphong. The quantity purchased by each firm is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Same Firm 1, 425 Hong Kong 415</p>
<p>Mainland 75 Shantou 95</p>
<p>Hunan 20 Total 2,030</p>
<p>Japanese yarn continues to fall in reaction. According to the market, after gradually soaring, actual demand remains unchanged. Reports that the Japanese army has seized concessions in Shanghai have caused bulls to feel uneasy, and the price has fallen sharply by 10 yuan, breaking the 400 yuan mark. Yueqin yarn for this month is priced at 398 yuan.</p>
<p>Although there are no transactions in cotton, the industry is unusually prosperous.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 bales of American and Indian cotton were traded.</p>
<p>Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York market hesitated yesterday because the US Department of Agriculture's proposed agricultural loan bill failed to pass. However, excessive rainfall in production areas has had a severe impact on cotton production, and there is no end in sight for government loans for cotton. Cloth transactions are improving day by day, and spot goods on the market are becoming tighter. As a result, cotton prices have risen, increasing by another 7 or 8 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, has risen by 1 rupee, and Egyptian cotton has risen by 3 or 5 points.</p>
<p>Although foreign firms in Shanghai have not set a date for trading, trading among domestic firms is unusually prosperous. Yesterday, domestic firms traded more than 3,000 bales of Indian and American cotton with each other. Recently, the arrival of goods at Japanese factories has been very congested. Previously, due to unsettled foreign exchange, payments could not be made, resulting in delays for many days. Now, after various efforts, some foreign exchange has been settled on the black market, and the goods that arrived earlier are currently being cleared through customs. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese factories' purchase of goods from flower firms will be temporarily reduced.</p>
<p>Cotton business is very sparse, but transactions among domestic firms are unusually lively. Most of these spot goods are sold to Japanese factories, and are raw materials for spinning 33-count and above. The fire machine flower bodies are of superior quality and the selling prices are very high. However, due to foreign exchange issues, the factories have not taken action and transactions are stagnant. Regarding sources from northern Jiangsu, 497 bales of Xiasha flower have arrived, as well as 1,958 bales of cotton from Ningbo and 170 bales from Beisha. The current situation of spot cotton is as follows:</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Rumors of Dalian Opening Up, Soybean Oil Price Falls, Crude Oil Remains Soft</h3>
<p>Soybean Oil: Previously, due to limited supply, morale was tense, providing manipulators with an excellent opportunity. As a result, market prices were on track to pursue the highest record on April 24. Until yesterday morning, the prices of various oils continued to rise sharply by one yuan. Specifically, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were priced at 33 yuan, 100 pieces of Yantai Qiqi oil were priced at 34 yuan, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil were priced at 33.5 yuan, and 500 cans of Tianjin canned oil were priced at 44.3 yuan. However, Dalian oil needed to rise by 1.8 yuan to 46.8 yuan, with 20 barrels traded. Also, 100 barrels of Kobe oil were priced at 46.3 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that the Dalian Oil Mountain pseudo-regime was responsible for transportation and that it would implement an opening up policy. Therefore, floating stockpiles were quickly released and market sentiment turned downstream. Kobe oil was the first to shed its price, plummeting from 45.5 yuan to 44.5 yuan, trading over 100 barrels, which was down 0.4 yuan from the previous day's highest price. As a result, other oils failed to continue trading at higher prices.</p>
<p>Crude Oil: The market opened unstably in the morning because Shandong firms were eagerly dumping Jiaozhou oil on the road. Therefore, market sentiment remained soft. As a result, 500 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded on the spot at 34 yuan, down 0.5 yuan from the previous market. More than 1,000 pieces of road goods were sold, priced at 33.5 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, under the poor atmosphere of soybean oil, prices fell 0.5 yuan to 33 yuan. Today, 450 pieces and 4,590 cans of crude oil were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake Still Soaring</p>
<p>Yesterday, soybean cake market prices, regardless of futures or spot, all jumped above the three yuan mark. The fiery fervor has not yet subsided. Tradable capital in the market is within the barricades of powerful stockpilers. Since Shantou firms have been purchasing Dalian miscellaneous brand cakes in recent days, the market has become even more fervent. Yesterday, the spot market price of Yuanji brand cake rose from 3.05 yuan to 3.14 yuan, with 4,000 pieces traded. Miscellaneous brands were priced from 3.05 yuan to 3.10 yuan, with over 30,000 pieces traded.

<h3>Piece Goods: Ningbo Firm Sales Show Development, Lun Chang Goods Market Attacked Suddenly, Dong Piece Tianjin Firm Recalling</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of white cloth, fine cloth, and coarse cloth in the market turned peaceful. However, because the stock of fine twill cloth in the market is short, and dyeing is still widely used, the price of 78-yard grey twill has reached 25 yuan per piece for top-grade and about 23.75 yuan for second-grade, an increase of 0.25 yuan per large piece. Dyeing factories in this street purchased more than 200 bales. Wenzhou firms purchased more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, and fine cloth.

Stockpilers' demand has become less frequent, stocking up on more than 100 pieces of white cloth. Demand for light-colored dyed and bleached cloth has weakened. Although costs are high, market prices fluctuate. However, the Zhejiang East Wenzhou and Youtou firms have been actively buying dark-colored line, straight line, and serge cloth for days, and have traded 300 boxes of Lun Chang Hong Zhang Li Xin factory products. Because Lun Chang goods are no longer produced by the factory, the current sales have tightened the inventory of domestic firms. Ordinary Kowloon Mountain serge has risen from 15.25 yuan to 15.90 yuan per piece. The new price of the first-class straight silk satin is 17.25 yuan, which is also more than one yuan higher than before.

Jin Feng brand large weft factory 16 and 14 pounds, compared to the end of last month's opening price, increased by 0.5 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Dong Piece</p>
<p>Because sales in the north were sluggish, customers from Tianjin and Qingdao firms in Shanghai were transferring their holdings, selling a large amount of goods in the morning and afternoon. Market morale was weak and prices were suppressed. Dragon head fine cloth fell sharply by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, with the lowest price at 14.55 yuan, but soon rebounded. At the close of the night market, it turned firm again. The price of Dragon head for this month is 14.70 yuan, and the price for next month is 14.85 yuan. Because dyeing sales in this street are still good, the price of fine twill is relatively stable.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Today, 560 pieces of cloth were shipped to Haiphong, 245 pieces to Hong Kong, 710 pieces to Shantou, and 120 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<p>Tea Green Twill</p>

Yesterday, top-grade British-made tea green twill was sold at 1.30 yuan per yard for wholesale. Second-grade non-Western goods were sold at 0.8 yuan, and top-grade goods were sold at 1.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the cost of new imports, the average price of wool has suddenly risen by about 1.50 yuan to 2 yuan per yard. Although it is the height of summer, the arrival of goods is scarce. However, waterproof raincoat fabric is in season and is mostly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea: European Sales Not Weak, Tea Prices Rise Frequently</h3>

<h3>Japan Will Not Take Any Action Against the Public Concession: Spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy Claims, But Says Reasonable Demands Will Be Made</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that when Japanese officials hosted journalists yesterday (the 13th), they were asked about Lord Altrincham's statement in the Upper House that July 7th was a dangerous date for the Public Concession. A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy declared that, as previously stated, if any major incidents occurred "across the Suzhou Creek," Japanese authorities would not guarantee that their troops would not enter the Public Concession. They had not heard the rumors that Japanese troops would occupy the Public Concession on July 7th. He personally did not believe this to be true. He did not criticize Mr. Hersch's speech, which mentioned the United States' firm stance against any Japanese encroachment on the Public Concession. He continued by saying that the authorities in this country cannot deny that the management mechanism of the Public Concession is outdated and unsuitable for the current situation. So far, we have demanded that the current policies of the Public Concession's management mechanism be corrected. Naturally, such reasonable demands will cause some discord if they are not agreed to by people of third countries. I cannot say what will happen until these demands are rejected or accepted. Japan will continue to demand the revision of the current policies of the Public Concession's management mechanism.</p>
<h3>Formal Resumption of Shanghai-Ningbo Route Still Awaits</h3>
<p>Detention of De Ping Understood</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route, since the Ningbo authorities ordered a blockade on March 5th, all previously approved ships have been uniformly prohibited from entering and leaving, and transportation has been cut off for more than a month. After repeated requests from all parties, the authorities, in order to facilitate the transportation of goods, have expediently allowed specially permitted ships to import necessities, but absolutely prohibit passengers. Therefore, the resumption of shipping is still</p>
<p>Temporary in nature, not a formal resumption. At the beginning of this month, it was widely rumored in Ningbo that the Shanghai-Ningbo route would be formally resumed starting on the 15th. However, as of 6:00 PM yesterday, shipping circles in this city had not received the aforementioned order. Therefore, the date of formal resumption still awaits. In addition, the De Ping ship of the Italian Chinese Shipping Company, was in Ningbo on the 3rd of this month, and was attacked by</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>So it set sail to Shanghai without being inspected by the military police authorities.

<p>Understanding Has Been Obtained</p>
<p>Permission was granted to reduce the detention by five days, which has now expired.

The TaiGuo Company has no ships going to Tianjin in the past two days. The Shengjing ship will not sail until the 17th. How things will change by then cannot be predicted at this time. Jardine Matheson has the Ding Sheng ship scheduled to depart at 1:00 PM this afternoon, passing through Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai to Tianjin. The goods that were originally loaded for Tianjin have all been returned to customs. However, the goods for Tanggu and more than 10,000 bags of flour will be transported as usual. The company also originally scheduled the Yong Sheng Xin ship to sail to Tianjin on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Lun Chang Labor and Management Are Quietly Awaiting a Reasonable Resolution, The Factory Does Not Recognize the Puppet Organization, Absolutely No Entrusted Mediation</h3>
<p>The labor-management dispute at the British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Pudong has been maliciously instigated by the puppet regime, attempting to incite an anti-British movement and forcibly prevent workers from returning to work, resulting in a failure to resolve the situation. After the factory's British employee, Ding Geller, was stabbed and killed by the Japanese army, the labor strike has further evolved into a diplomatic issue, causing the labor strike itself to become deadlocked. All honest workers, under the threat and coercion of the "puppet strike committee" and the so-called "workers' union," have lost their freedom and are eager to return to the factory as soon as possible. It is now understood that the factory is quietly awaiting negotiations by the British government to seek a reasonable resolution. However, the puppet regime suddenly spread rumors a few days ago, claiming that the factory manager, Sinclair, had requested mediation from the Japanese side and had been introduced by the Japanese side to meet with the "Municipal Government Authorities." According to inquiries from the labor side, the news is completely inaccurate. The factory has never recognized the puppet organization, so there has been absolutely no entrusted mediation. The puppet regime's dissemination of this rumor is clearly intended to offer itself. (Da Guang She)</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers: Fabricated Story</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that the New Shenbao, controlled by the Japanese, published a prominent message yesterday (the 13th), stating that personnel from the Pudong Lun Chang Textile Factory, led by Director Sinclair, visited the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters on June 9th to request Japanese assistance in resolving the deadlock in the Lun Chang factory strike. It was agreed to report to the "Shanghai Municipal Government" for arbitration. The reporter asked the Lun Chang Company personnel, and they remained silent, saying that they could not say a word about this situation a month ago. According to reliable sources, the strikers and the company had resolved the strike on June 2nd. However, according to reliable sources, on June 5th, when the workers intended to enter the factory, they were blocked by the henchmen of the puppet regime. The "New Shenbao" message also stated that, at the request of the Lun Chang personnel, the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps visited Zhou, the "Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs of the Municipal Government," with Sinclair and others on the morning of June 11th. Zhou promised to make every effort to peacefully resolve the strike. Pseudo-officials have "changed their attitude" in view of the Lun Chang Company's decision and have attached great importance to their contact with the "Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>
<p>Ding Geller Case Not Yet Resolved</p>
<p>The China Press reports that a Japanese spokesperson claimed yesterday (at a reception for journalists on the 13th) that the Japanese authorities had not yet sent a reply regarding the British protest after Ding Geller's death. After receiving the protest, the Japanese Consul-General Miura held talks with the British Consul-General Philip to discuss the basic relationship between Britain and Japan and the method of "eliminating disputes."</p>
<h3>Bloodshed Occurred on Route Doumer Yesterday Morning, Li Tianzhu and His Wife Were Shot by Thugs, Wife Died on the Spot, Li Himself is in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Search in the French Park</p>
<p>Zhou Wenyan, a 32-year-old Ningbo native and second landlord of No. 3, Dasheng Lane, No. 54 Route Doumer, is in the cigarette and paper business. In mid-June, there was a room for rent downstairs in the main hall. At that time, a Sichuanese named Li Tianzhu (28 years old this year) and his wife, Xu Yuanzhen (also known as Huiyu, 24 years old this year, from Jiaxing), went to rent the house. The monthly rent was set at 44 yuan, and it was agreed that the upstairs and downstairs houses would be separated. The second landlord and the upstairs tenants would enter and exit from the back alley, and the Li couple would live in the main hall and enter and exit from the</p>
<p>Front Door</p>
<p>Li and his wife moved in on the 17th of last month, hiring a maid to take care of chores. According to Li, he opened a Huihe Candy Company with double-fronted stores numbered 267 and 269 next to the Bial Road Ramon Grand Theatre, so it was common for him to leave early and return late. At 8:15 AM yesterday morning,</p>
<p>The Li Couple Just Gotten Up</p>
<p>The maid went to the small vegetable market to buy vegetables and returned, washing them in the courtyard, while Li was preparing to get dressed and go out, when suddenly two thugs pushed open the front door and entered. Without asking any questions, they immediately drew their guns and opened fire on Li Tianzhu and Li Xu Yuanzhen. Li's face and chest were each hit by one bullet, and Li Xu Yuanzhen's right breast and lower abdomen were each hit by one bullet. Both of them</p>
<p>Fell to the Ground at the Same Time</p>
<p>Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the murderers turned around and left quickly. At that time, Li's maid was washing vegetables in the courtyard. The sudden sound of gunfire frightened her and she dared not look up, not seeing the faces or clothing of the murderers clearly. The upstairs tenants and the second landlord also did not pay attention. After the murderers left, the maid recovered from her shock and saw that the master and mistress were lying on the floor, with fresh blood flowing from their wounds.</p>
<p>Gushing Out</p>
<p>She ran outside the lane to report to the police post, who forwarded the report to the French Police Department. They immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and found that Li's wife, Xu Yuanzhen, had died of her injuries. Li was on his last breath, and an ambulance was immediately called to rush Li to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are very serious and his life may be in danger. At the same time, Xu Yuanzhen's body was sent to the autopsy room attached to the Labor Bureau Hospital on Rue Talast, awaiting today's report to the Special Second Court</p>
<p>To Send Personnel for Inspection</p>
<p>The reason for the Li couple's murder is being investigated by the police. The Police Department has instructed all detectives on duty to strictly search for the fleeing murderers and bring them to justice. At the same time, the French Police Department also ordered a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, about 40 people, to rush to the vicinity of the incident at 8:50 AM to conduct a thorough search of the French Park. First, the park gates on Avenue Lafayette and Avenue Hua Long and the side gate on Avenue Mallia were</p>
<p>Closed to Prohibit Visitors</p>
<p>From Entering and Exiting, Then the Detectives Began to Inspect the Tourists in the Park, Creating a Tense Atmosphere. It Took 25 Minutes to Finish, But the Results Were Unsuccessful. The Detectives Then Retreated and the Park Gates Were Reopened.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador's Safety: Continued Strict Protection; Ambassador Conforms to Popular Request and Wears a Steel Wire Vest; Rumored Bulletproof Car Being Prepared</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that the precautions taken by the Public Concession Police and the British military authorities to protect the life of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, showed no signs of relaxation yesterday (the 13th). Chinese and Western police officers in the ambassador's uniform at the embassy at 27 Bund and the residence at 50 Tunsin Road have been replaced by detectives. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has now followed advice and wears a</p>
<p>Steel Wire Vest</p>
<p>when travelling on the streets of Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, he seems quite uncomfortable wearing this protective clothing. The ambassador's vest can withstand high-velocity Mauser bullets. The Western detectives protecting him on the left and right wear various lighter vests. Yesterday, a bulletproof car for the ambassador's use was also opened, and it is currently being manufactured in this city. However, this statement could not be confirmed. It is believed that when this car is in use, the accompanying</p>
<p>Police Officers</p>
<p>will be greatly reduced. However, the number of military police stationed at the embassy and its residence will remain unchanged. No official news was obtained yesterday. It is rumored that the ambassador's life is not under direct threat, nor have there been any intimidation incidents. However, the authorities have received information that someone is planning to plot against the ambassador's life. Reporters inquired among police circles yesterday, and they only confirmed that precautions had been taken, without saying anything else. Furthermore, the "Continental Times" reports that yesterday (the 13th), well-informed sources claimed that the</p>
<p>Special Precautions</p>
<p>taken since Saturday afternoon to protect the life of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, will continue for several weeks or even longer without interruption. News regarding threats or even conspiracies against the British Ambassador remained strictly secret yesterday, and no details could be ascertained. However, well-informed sources claimed that the increasing violence between the Japanese army and navy authorities in China has some connection with the precautions taken to ensure the ambassador's safety. Last night, reliable sources revealed that heavy</p>
<p>Gunfire</p>
<p>had been heard in the vicinity of the British Ambassador's residence on Tunsin Road yesterday morning. However, the distance was very far. Since this incident occurred within the Japanese-controlled area, the Public Concession Police did not conduct an investigation. It is rumored that the incident was caused by bandits attempting to rob a Chinese merchant's factory, and exchanging fire with the "Great Way" police.</p>
<p>Songjiang Ferry: Temporarily Terminating at Yexie</p>
<p>The ferry service from the Concession to Minhang and Yexie, which extends to Songjiang and stops at Xintai and Tu'lermiao along the way to pick up passengers, according to sources in the inland river shipping industry, on the 12th, the ferry departing from Shanghai was blocked near Xintai and forced to return. Because the situation there is chaotic, and fighting has been taking place in recent days, the ferry service to Xintai, Tu'lermiao, and Songjiang now terminates at Yexie. Inspections of passengers are still strict.</p>
<h3>The Puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" Attempts to Utilize White Russians, Threatening All White Russian Groups to Register, but They Would Rather Dissolve Their Organizations</h3>
<p>The "Continental Times" reports that the White Russian Emigrant Committee, backed by the Japanese, published a formal notice in Russian newspapers in this city on the 4th of this month, stating that the "Shanghai Municipal Government" required all White Russian groups in the city to register with the committee by June 15th, in order to centrally control the "political intentions" of the White Russian groups. Several long-established White Russian organizations are therefore seriously considering ceasing their activities. Many members of the various groups believe that it would be better to dissolve than to register, because this move has</p>
<p>Political Purposes.</p>
<p>The Public Concession and French Concession</p>
<p>authorities have repeatedly warned White Russian emigrant groups that they must not engage in activities within the two concessions, and that violators will be deported. Although White Russian groups are not without fear of retaliation by the White Russian Emigrant Committee if they do not register, some groups believe that they would rather cease their activities. The committee's notice also stated that the committee would not provide assistance or protection to groups that ignored this registration requirement, and would not</p>
<p>Issue Passports</p>
<p>and other documents. According to many White Russians in Shanghai, this registration order is actually a means for the "Shanghai Municipal Government" to politically control the White Russians in Shanghai through the White Russian Emigrant Committee. Furthermore, they fear that after registration, detailed regulations will be imposed on the registered groups, eventually leading them to engage in certain political activities, which would be interfered with by the authorities of the two concessions, and endanger their own status. The vast majority of the 15,000 White Russians in Shanghai do not engage in politics, and only hope for a stable life. Most of them have already registered with the "Shanghai Municipal Government", which is a fact, but because they have no consular protection, they have no other choice.</p>

<h3>Various Organizations Hope That All Industries Will Voluntarily Curb Prices; Some Goods Unrelated to Foreign Exchange Take Advantage of the Situation to Raise Prices; Concession Authorities Take It Very Seriously and Are Monitoring the Situation; Rice Prices Are Clearly Being Manipulated and Are Soaring Unabated</h3>
<p>The various public organizations in Shanghai believe that the continuous price increases in various industries and the endless rise in the prices of all goods are a matter of grave concern. Furthermore, some commodities that are not related to foreign exchange are taking the opportunity to raise their prices, only seeking their own profits and disregarding the livelihood of the public. This kind of behavior is deliberately disrupting the market and making the social situation even more severe. If it is not quickly curbed, then merchants in various industries will follow suit. The impact will be that ordinary people will be unable to live. Therefore, in addition to requesting the authorities to take effective measures, it is also hoped that the leaders of various industries and merchants can uphold their conscience, consider the overall situation, and refrain from arbitrarily increasing prices unless absolutely necessary, so that social order can be stabilized. Then all industries will benefit from it. The price of rice, since the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee automatically disbanded, the 15-yuan limit price in the Shanghai rice market has been invisibly canceled. Speculators are manipulating rice prices, using the pretext of the tightening of the black market foreign exchange and the time when the new crop is not yet available, resulting in soaring rice prices without end. Yesterday, the market price of top-grade white rice actually rose to more than 19 yuan. Medium-quality rice also rose accordingly. After inquiring from relevant parties, it was learned that the source of supply from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has not been cut off, and there are still more than 560,000 bags of rice in Shanghai. The tightening of black market foreign exchange has nothing to do with domestic rice, so the soaring rice prices breaking the 19-yuan mark is clearly the manipulation of speculators. This matter is of great importance to the food supply of the entire city, and all sectors hope that the Concession authorities will decisively deal with it.</p>
<p>Various Industries</p>
<p>Raise Prices</p>
<p>Since the sharp rise in foreign exchange, the prices of various goods such as gasoline,</p>
<p>hardware, Western medicine, coal, taxis, leather, etc. have all been notified to increase. Rickshaw merchants will also hold a meeting to re-submit a request for rent increase. Yesterday, industries such as enamel, coal balls, knitwear, paint, etc., and factories such as the China National Power Arts and Crafts Factory, Qingchang Screw Factory, and Huozhong Leather Factory, etc., announced the implementation of price increases.</p>
<p>Serious Threat to</p>
<p>the Lives of Ordinary People in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the war, due to traffic obstruction and time-consuming transportation, the prices of all daily necessities and goods have been repeatedly increased. Compared with before the war, some have even increased by more than one time, and the general increase is also about 30-40%. The burden of rent, water, electricity, and other goods is even heavier. The lives of ordinary people were already difficult to cope with. Unexpectedly, recently, since the change in foreign exchange, various industries have raised prices due to cost reasons, causing the general salary class and ordinary coolies to be unable to maintain their lives, and their lives have been seriously threatened, and everyone is frowning.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities</p>
<p>Emphasize Development</p>
<p>The Public Concession Public Works Department believes that the high prices affect the livelihood of ordinary people, and some have suggested that the board of directors discuss ways to curb them. However, after considering the results, it is believed that this phenomenon is inevitable after the war at a time when the level of living is unstable. Under the principle of maintaining public order, the Concession authorities should emphasize its development. However, in order to be concerned about the living conditions of ordinary people, they are now collecting relevant materials and preparing reports for reference. When necessary, appropriate measures may be taken.</p>
<p>Postal Employees</p>
<p>Request Allowances</p>
<p>Since the war, Shanghai postal employees have been paid according to the deduction of salaries. The employees have endured hardships without complaint because of the extraordinary times. Recently, due to the high prices in Shanghai, the cost of living index in May rose to 164.87 (based on 1936), the highest record since the war. Those who rely on salaries for a living are all overwhelmed. For this reason, postal employees have requested the authorities to increase allowances, and have cited the Central Bank's increase of allowances as an example, and unanimously requested it. The labor union is now carrying out this matter, and it is heard that the authorities sympathize with it and are willing to make appropriate solutions, and it is expected that there will be satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Passenger Matters on Shanghai-Ningbo Cargo Ships</p>
<p>Have Not Yet Been Approved</p>
<p>All Ships Comply with the Ban</p>
<p>Cargo is Transported as Usual</p>
<p>After the Ningbo Defense Command approved the resumption of navigation of foreign ships to Ningbo in order to clear the Ningbo cargo transport, the Shanghai-Ningbo foreign ships now operating are the British Taikoo Company's "New Beijing" ship, the Italian Chinese-Italian Company's "De Ping" ship, and the German Rehe &amp; Company's "Moufu" ship. However, they are only allowed to load cargo, and absolutely prohibited from carrying passengers. The "New Life News" reporter inquired from the shipping industry yesterday that regarding the issue of passengers on Shanghai-Ningbo ships, the Shanghai industries had jointly submitted a request to the Zhejiang military authorities, requesting accommodation to allow passengers to be attached to cargo ships in order to facilitate the collection of accounts by various industries during the Dragon Boat Festival. As of yesterday, no reply had been received. Therefore, the ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line will temporarily prohibit passengers in order to comply with government orders. However, navigation is still carried out as usual, so there is no so-called formal resumption of navigation.</p>
<p>Chen Jintao's</p>
<p>Funeral Was Desolate</p>
<p>Very Few Friends Mourned</p>
<p>Chen Jintao, the "Finance Minister of the Reformed Government" and "President of the Huaxing Bank," died of heart disease on the 12th. The details were first recorded in this newspaper on the 13th. It is now learned that Chen's body was collected at 3 p.m. yesterday at 18 Dongfang Village, Baole'an Road. Very few relatives and friends of Chen visited to mourn, so the scene was desolate. As for the vacancy of "President of Huaxing," it is rumored that there are many who are vying for it in Nanjing, but no decision has been made yet.</p>
<h3>Japan Refuses to Open the Yangtze River; Japanese Ships Sail Exclusively Between Shanghai and Hankou; Advertisements Are Publicly Posted to Solicit Customers; It Is Difficult for British Ships to Resume Navigation in Reality</h3>
<p>Japan is attempting to monopolize China's shipping industry, blockading coastal ports, hindering the sailing of ships of third countries, and refusing to open the Yangtze River. Dalian, Nisshin, and other companies sail exclusively, and advertisements are posted to solicit customers. It is difficult for British ships to resume navigation in reality. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japan Refuses to</p>
<p>Open the Yangtze River</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hankou shipping route from Shanghai to Hankou passes through Nantong, Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu Datong, Anqing, Huayang, Jiujiang, Wuxue, Qichun, Huangshigang, Huangzhou, and other places. Before the war, the ships operating were British Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the private Sanbei, Ningshao, and Japanese Nisshin. Since the fall of Hankou, Chinese ships have been forced to completely suspend navigation. Foreign ships, because the Japanese used military relations as an excuse, refused to sail the Yangtze River. Although the British side made representations, requesting that the Yangtze River be opened quickly, they were ultimately rejected by the Japanese side. At the end of last month, Jardine Matheson's "Ruihe" ship and Taikoo's "Wuxue" ship sailed from Shanghai to Hankou, carrying the British Navy's troop movements and cannot be considered as the resumption of British merchant ships.</p>
<p>Nisshin Dalian</p>
<p>Sends Ships to Sail Exclusively</p>
<p>In order to monopolize the Yangtze River shipping industry, the Japanese Nisshin Company and Dalian Steamship Company have sent ships to sail exclusively between Shanghai and Hankou, and also Jiujiang, and have entrusted a certain travel agency to post advertisements to solicit customers. The advertisements stated: "In order to facilitate travel to Hankou, we handle all procedures, send special personnel to escort, guarantee absolute safety along the way, and charge low prices." Small ferries are prepared to send passengers to Wusong to board the ship free of charge. Passengers are requested to register early. "The price to Hankou is 40 yuan in national currency, and to Jiujiang is 30 yuan in national currency. All are class prices." Japanese ships sailing between Shanghai and Hankou almost always have many every day.</p>
<p>It Is Difficult</p>
<p>for British Ships to Resume Navigation</p>
<p>The ships of the British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies that sail the Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Hunan routes, Taikoo are Wenzhou, Wuchang, Wuxue, Wulin, Shashi, etc., Jardine Matheson are Xianghe, Jianghe, Shihe, Tonghe, Ruihe, Pinghe, etc. After the Japanese refused to open the Yangtze River, the ships were either berthed in Shanghai, trapped in Hankou, or changed to sail the North Sha, Shanghai-Nantong lines, etc. This time, the Taikoo "Wulin" ship and the Jardine Matheson "Ruihe" ship, which were loaded with British naval troop movements to Shanghai, were blocked by the Japanese from carrying passengers on both British ships. No matter whether they were Chinese or foreigners, they were all prohibited. Therefore, the resumption of British ships on the Shanghai-Hankou line is difficult to achieve in the short term. The losses in the shipping industry are immeasurable.</p>
<p>Selling Nanyang Goods</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Certification</p>
<p>In Order to Have a Basis</p>
<p>When Paying Taxes</p>
<p>Goods sold in South America must be certified by the place of origin in accordance with the regulations of various South American countries, so that there is a basis when paying taxes. It is now heard that Chinese goods shipped from Shanghai must be stamped by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on the invoice.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police Disguise Themselves as Coolies and Chase People on Nanjing Road; Three Japanese Soldiers Chase a Chinese Man, and Are Brought to the Police Station by an Indian Constable Together;—After Interrogation by the Police Station, They Are Released Together—</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reports that yesterday (the 13th) at about 7 p.m., the Japanese military police once again did not cooperate with the police station, but expanded their activities into the Public Concession, chasing a "Chinese hired by the Reformed Government" along Nanjing Road, and beat the Chinese in the Central Police Station. The details are recorded as follows: Three Japanese military police disguised as coolies came with the Chinese from Jiangwan and landed at the Waterfront Hotel on the Bund. The Japanese soldiers entered the Public Concession with the intention of arresting someone on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek. The Chinese hired to point out the person they intended to arrest. When they arrived at</p>
<p>Waterfront Hotel</p>
<p>The Chinese Felt Afraid and Suddenly Changed His Mind and Jumped Out of the Window, Crossing the Bund and Running West Along Nanjing Road. The three Japanese soldiers hurriedly chased after him. When the Chinese was fleeing, he was carrying a bag. A foreigner was driving a car west and, seeing this situation, thought that the Chinese was robbing a bag and escaping, so he drove the car into the driveway of a gas station, blocking the sidewalk. The Chinese</p>
<p>Was Captured By Those Pursuing Him. At This Time</p>
<p>An Indian Constable</p>
<p>arrived at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road and led several people into the Central Police Station. The foreigner who drove the car to block the road went along with them. In a room at the Central Police Station, the Chinese was talking to the three people, and said angry words to the leader. Only then did he learn that the others were Japanese. The leader was a special agent officer. Hearing this, he beat the helpless Chinese. The police officer sitting at the desk left the desk and spoke to the Japanese military officer, saying that this could not happen on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>A Japanese Officer Heard About It, Only</p>
<p>Showed His Teeth and Smiled Cunningly</p>
<p>And Tried to Approach the Police Officer to Find Him, but Was Rejected. Although Deputy Police Chief Gibson Said Flatly That There Was Nothing Else, Only That the Chinese Was Detained by the Japanese Military Officer and Escaped, It Was Heard From Reliable Sources That the Chinese Was Hired by the "Reformed Government" Since October Last Year and Landed in the Public Concession With the Obvious Purpose of Indicating to the Japanese Soldiers a Certain Chinese Residing in the Concession. Police Officers Interrogated the Four Hostages, and Released Them All Together. The Chinese They Planned to Arrest</p>
<p>Had Probably Avoided</p>
<p>Them, and Then Drove Away</p>
<p>An Eyewitnessing Foreigner Who Blocked the Road Said That If He Had Known That the Chinese Was Escaping From the Japanese, He Would Not Have Blocked Him. Furthermore, the "North-China Daily News" Reports That Yesterday (the 13th) Just After 7 p.m., Three Armed Japanese Military Police Dressed as Chinese Coolies Chased a Man Dressed in a Zhongshan Suit Along Nanjing Road From the Bund. At First, Everyone Mistook the Chinese for a Customs Inspector. Many Chinese and Foreign People Witnessed It. When They Reached the Intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, They Suddenly Stopped Because an Indian Constable Stationed There Blocked Them and Asked the People to Follow Him Into the Central Police Station. It Was Later Learned That the</p>
<p>Chinese Chased</p>
<p>By the Japanese Soldiers Was a Member of the "Great Way" or "Reformed Government." As for the Reason Why the Japanese Military Police Wanted to Arrest Him, It Was Not Possible to Find Out Last Night. However, Seeing That the Japanese Military Police Were Dressed in Chinese Clothes and Did Not Cooperate With the Police Station, They Acted Within the Public Concession, and Everyone Began to Speculate. Late Until 1 a.m. Today (the 14th), Detectives From the Central Police Station and the Special Section Were Still Interrogating the Four. At Nearly 8 a.m., a Japanese Military Officer Arrived at the Central Police Station in a Car With</p>
<p>Shanghai Garrison</p>
<p>Note No. 164. Five Hours Later, He Had Not Yet Left. Detailed Inquiries Were Made to the Police Last Night and This Morning, but They Did Not Say a Word, Only Denying the Arrest. The Police Department Is Currently Investigating.</p>
<h3>Even in the Occupied Areas, Copper Coins Are in Short Supply; There Is a Rumor That Additional Three-Cent Subsidiary Currency Notes Will Be Issued; Merchants Use Stamps as Temporary Currency, Which Benefits the National Treasury</h3>
<p>The "New News Agency" reporter asked a major financier about the remedy for the shortage of copper coins. According to him, various shops, bus and tram companies, etc., are now issuing their own substitute currency notes due to the shortage of copper coins. This is a temporary remedy. Judging from the current situation, if you want to permanently eliminate this kind of panic, you can only (1) transport a large number of copper-nickel coins to Shanghai to supply the market for circulation, (2) issue one-cent, two-cent, and five-cent subsidiary currency notes. The former may encounter difficulties due to transportation, and there is still a risk of being absorbed after being transported to Shanghai, so the latter's issuance of fractional notes is the best remedy. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has been studying this suggestion and has added a three-cent subsidiary currency note.</p>
<p>The Occupied Areas</p>
<p>Are the Same</p>
<p>According to transportation industry sources, the wave of panic over the lack of copper coins in Shanghai has now quickly invaded the occupied areas. Recently, the market in occupied areas such as Subei and Wuxi has also felt a lack of copper coins, and it is difficult to find change, which proves that traitors are driven by profit and are unscrupulous. It is learned that buying copper coins in the occupied areas has long become a secretly open event, which is the same as the massive smuggling of scrap copper and iron,</p>
<p>Stamps Sell Well, Benefiting the National Treasury</p>
<p>After the shortage of copper subsidiary coins in this city, all sectors have used stamps and stamps as substitutes. In the first few days, most used stamps because stamps are more commonly used. But in the last one or two days, they have all switched to stamps because (1) there are not many one-cent stamps, which are not enough to meet the needs. There are more one-cent stamps, which can be borrowed in large quantities for circulation. (2) Once a stamp is damaged, the post office must treat it as underpaid according to regulations. Stamps are freely affixed by all industries and sectors, and must be stamped before they are cancelled. If there is slight stain, it will not be voided. (3) If stamps flow into the occupied areas, the other party can also affix and use them. There is absolutely no such worry about stamps. (4) Stamps are national taxes, and their circulation indirectly benefits the national treasury. For the above four reasons, the stamps sold by various tobacco shops are very popular. Also, because the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, the invoices and receipts opened by various industries must be affixed with stamps in accordance with the law. Those worth more than one yuan are affixed with one cent, those worth more than three yuan are affixed with two cents, those worth more than ten yuan are affixed with four cents, and those worth more than one hundred yuan are affixed with six cents, so the demand is greater.</p>
<p>Major Companies</p>
<p>Affix Stamps in Accordance With the Law</p>
<p>Major companies on Nanjing Road, such as Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, Lihua, and China National Products Company, have long been affixing stamps to all invoices and receipts in accordance with the law. The Da Sun Company will also comply from today.</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation Branch</p>
<p>Issues Substitute Currency Notes</p>
<p>The Xinzha Road Municipal 16th District Branch, repeatedly reported by members that there is a shortage of copper coins in the market, and business is difficult, and they have repeatedly requested to find ways to remedy it. The association believes that this matter is of great importance, and especially at 4 p.m. yesterday, it invited various merchants to discuss it on their own. More than one hundred representatives from Jiukang Pawnshop, Gongda, Zhengda, Dashunchang, Maotaixin, Chengdaxin, Cuihe, Qiantai Chang, Qianchang, Dashun Gong, Tongfuyong, Taifeng, Taikang, Dachangxiang, Dexingchang, Rongda, Zhang Jinji, Yuchangde, Zhang Xinhe, Henghexing, Song Shengxin, Lao Wenbao, Shou Kangyuan, Xinhe, Yuan Zengxiang, Lao Jin Da, Tong Fengyu, Zhongxing, Zheng Changxiang, Wanxing, Zhenkang, Dekang, Shunkang, and other shops, after careful discussion, decided to issue a joint temporary substitute currency note. The regulations are as follows: (1) Name it "Xinzha Road Commercial Temporary Joint Substitute Currency Note." (2) Only one type of "one cent" substitute currency note will be issued, and all will be numbered and have stubs. (3) All substitute currency notes will be stamped with a convenient seal and co-sealed by the participating merchants. (4) This substitute currency note can be exchanged for one jiao of legal currency at the participating merchants after accumulating ten points. The list of participating merchants will be distributed to each merchant for posting. (5) If a counterfeit currency note is found by a merchant, it should be reported immediately for investigation. (6) Once the government has decided on a remedy, the substitute currency notes will be recalled immediately. (7) Wang Maoqing, Zhu Yunsheng, Wang Zhaoji, Chen Jicheng, Zhu Yutao, Qu Qiufang, Chen Weiwen, Wang Yuncai, Hu Jianren, Chen Cailing, Liu Yunqing, and other eleven people were elected as members of the currency and steel seal safekeeping committee. (8) The currency will be deposited in a bank as a special fund. When withdrawing it, it must be signed and sealed by five members of the safekeeping committee. Then, the number of currency notes needed by each merchant was determined on the spot, totaling 750 yuan.

<p>Shortage of Copper Coins,</p>
<p>The Panic Has Not Been Eliminated</p>
<p>This city has experienced a shortage of copper subsidiary coins many times since the war, but none has been as severe as this time. In the past, although there was a shortage, there were still a few in circulation on the market, and the exchange rate was only slightly higher. Unexpectedly, this time, the shortage of copper subsidiary coins has completely disappeared from the market. What is the reason for this? In addition to traitors profiteering, hoarding, or smuggling them abroad, the obstruction of the supply source is the biggest factor. Therefore, although the panic caused by the lack of fractional coins in this city has been remedied by various industries on their own, it has not been completely eliminated.</p>

<h3>Landlord Forced to Evict Subtenant After Dividing House: Landlord Loses Lawsuit Twice</h3>

<p>I was in Hong Kong previously before coming to Shanghai, and met with many friends and relatives who said on Wednesday June 7, your newspaper published "Pudong Guerrilla Captain Fan Gencai, because I have special influence in southwestern Shanghai, recently incited the guerrilla comrades in Pudong, issuing a reward of 2,000 yuan for my arrest," and I found it strange. I have served as secretary and intelligence chief of the Military Commission, but I have not participated in any political work since I went to Hong Kong to do business last summer. How can I go to Pudong? I think someone is impersonating me, resulting in this misunderstanding. Also, according to many people, there is another person named Tao Xisheng, but the pronunciation is the same but the characters are different, which has nothing to do with me. It concerns my reputation, and I am afraid of spreading misinformation. Please correct it. Sincerely, Tao Xuesheng.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of the Medicine King</h3>
<p>— Ding Jimin</p>
<p>Now, the birthday of the Medicine King is not clearly distinguished in most places. It is almost a mixed birthday of Shennong, Wei Xundao, and the Medicine King Bodhisattva. From a dialectical point of view, of course, Shennong representing the Medicine King is the most original basis. It is indeed very meaningful to commemorate the great inventions of the ancient sages.</p>
<p>Records of the Medicine King Temple are rarely seen in various books. However, most cities and counties have Medicine King Temples. If it is said that they were automatically established by local people, not due to government coercion, I am afraid it would not be so widespread, would it? The Yuan Dynasty once issued a national order to build the Three Sovereigns Temple. Later generations did not verify it and passed on the wrong information, turning it into the Medicine King Temple. Regarding this point, we can cite the Three Sovereigns Temple Records from Yuan Yu Bosheng's "Daoguo Xuegulu" as proof:</p>
<p>The Three Sovereigns Temple Records Newly Built in Lean County, Fuzhou Road: The Three Sovereigns Temple is the shrine of Emperor Fuxi Shennong. From the national capital to the counties, all medical scholars must establish it. This is the system of our country.</p>
<p>Reconstruction of the Two Sovereigns Temple in Cili Prefecture, Lizhou Road: According to the system of the state, from the national capital to the counties, there is no remote communication. The governors and officials must build temples and worship the Three Sovereigns. …</p>
<p>Reconstruction of the Medical Three Sovereigns Temple in Chongren County: Our Emperor Shizu unified the characters and took the system of ancient and modern times. Everything was restored, and the virtue of heaven and earth was taken as virtue, and the ability of the saints was taken as ability. All that was considered for the people and things was complete and thorough. The Three Sovereigns Temple is one of them.</p>
<p>The Three Sovereigns Temple Records Newly Built in Fenyi County, Yuanzhou Road: …The fixed system is to worship only the society and the masters. Our dynasty started building the Three Sovereigns Temple to worship Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor. From the national capital to the counties, the three are worshipped.</p>
<p>After reading these records, we can understand that Yuan Shizu did use the power of the emperor to urge the establishment of "Three Sovereigns Temples" everywhere, and did not establish "Medicine King Temples." Later, I don't know how it went wrong. However, in the early Ming Dynasty, the scholar-officials had already discovered this error. Therefore, Emperor Taizu of Ming issued the following order:</p>
<p>In the fourth year of Hongwu, the edict said: The Three Sovereigns accumulated heaven and established the foundation, and opened the source of teaching and transformation for all ages. Is it possible to attribute it to the Medicine Master? No one in the world's counties should blaspheme!</p>
<p>From the early Yuan Dynasty to the early Ming Dynasty, only eight or nine years passed in between. However, the good "Three Sovereigns Temple" was mistaken for the "Medicine King Temple." No wonder Emperor Taizu of Ming said: "Is it possible to attribute it to the Medicine Master?" Later, Mao Tuizhi of the Qing Dynasty also mentioned this matter in the Chinese and Western Medical Talks. He said:</p>
<p>Some people use the image of Wei Xundao as the Medicine King and sculpt another herb garment, which is no different from the image of Shennong. Based on the words in the almanac, the birthday of the Medicine King on April 28th, it is alluded to confuse. …</p>
<p>Mao's argument is inevitably too affirmative. Shennong's merit of tasting herbs is vastly different from that of Wei. It is not appropriate to respect him as the Medicine King? From the perspective of modern times, he should be honored as the Medicine King of our country, that is, the ancestor of pharmacology in the world.</p>

<h3>The Meaning of "Medicine Emperor's Birthday"</h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>Commemorating the "Ancestor of World Medicine"</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Liande wrote a preface to "History of Chinese Medicine," and his opening sentence said: "Emperor Shennong is actually the ancestor of world medicine and has the most glorious history!" Today, Chinese science is lagging behind in everything. However, Shennong's invention of materia medica is the reason why we can still occupy the first place in the world's medical history. Various countries commemorate their scientific inventors with annual sacrifices, centennial sacrifices, or millennial sacrifices, all of which are grand and cited as the "glory of the country." Our country has the Medicine Emperor's Birthday, and the whole country worships and pays homage every year. Although its birthday is mixed with the Buddhist Medicine King's Birthday, the significance of commemorating Shennong is not wrong. Now, from a world perspective, the Medicine Emperor's Birthday can be said to be the memorial day of the ancestor of world medicine, and it is also the only "glory that enhances the country" in our country.</p>
<p>Shennong's invention of materia medica is known to the world. It can also be confirmed in historical records, such as:</p>
<p>The Annals of Emperors and Kings in the Records of the Historian says: "Emperor Yan Shennong was born in Jiangshui, so he was surnamed Jiang. He was born with sacred virtue and first taught the world to cultivate the five grains and eat them, so as to save the evils of killing life. He tasted herbs and announced medicine to heal diseases, so as to save the lives of the wounded. The people use it every day without knowing it, and he wrote four volumes of Materia Medica."</p>
<p>The preface to A and B Classics says: "In ancient times, Shennong first tasted herbs and knew hundreds of medicines. Yi Yin used his talent as an Asian sage to compile and use Shennong's Materia Medica to make soups."</p>
<p>Search for Gods says: "Shennong's vermilion whip, hundreds of medicines, fully knows their flat, poisonous, cold, and warm nature, and the taste they dominate to sow hundreds of grains."</p>
<p>The History of Chinese Medicine says: "The rise of medicine in our country began with Shennong. Therefore, Shennong is the ancestor of medicine in our country. At that time, the people's intelligence was not enlightened, and they had no fixed place to live. They did not know the method of farming and animal husbandry. They used naturally produced plants as living materials. Those plants containing vomiting and diarrhea properties were also directly taken. Shennong distinguished which one was vomiting, which one was diarrhea, and which grass and tree could not be used as food. He also used vomiting grass and trees to treat heartache and depression, and used diarrhea grass and trees to treat abdominal distension and constipation. These are the origins of medical knowledge. The Historical Records and Outline Mirror both say that Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs and first had medicine. Huainanzi Xiuwu Xun said that Shennong first taught the people to taste the flavors of hundreds of herbs."</p>
<p>Shennong's invention of materia medica has been used to treat diseases, maintain health, and reproduce the population for five thousand years, I don't know how many millions of people. His long-term benefits and deep blessings are unparalleled in the world. The medicines listed in Shennong's Materia Medica are still the main commodities of our country's export trade, and their legacy has almost spread to the world. During this period of resistance, the government also knew that the export of Chinese medicine was one of the main forces for earning foreign exchange. Therefore, it specially established the Central Drug Research Institute in Kunming to specialize in researching, identifying, and adjusting exports. According to recent publications, the annual export volume can reach 100 million yuan. The importance of farmers' trust can be imagined, and it will greatly benefit the national strength during the war. Therefore, today's commemoration of the Medicine Emperor has another important meaning.</p>

<p>It is also not impossible.</p>
<p>During the Sui and Tang dynasties, when Buddhism prevailed in China, there was also the name "Medicine King" in Buddhist scriptures, but it was not valued by our scholars and officials. Furthermore, they also supported a domestic Medicine King: It may also be useful to excerpt some records here for everyone's reference:</p>
<p>Wei Xundao, styled Cizang, was from Jingzhao in the Tang Dynasty and was proficient in medicine. During the Wu Zetian period, he served as the imperial physician and was promoted to Guanglu Qing. He often brought a black dog with him and dispensed medicine to help people. The people respected him and called him the Medicine King.</p>
<p>Wei Xundao, styled Cizang, was from the Tang Dynasty. He was a saint in medicine, and people admired him. Many doctors also made portraits together to worship him.</p>
<p>When Duke Zhongxian was six or seven years old, he was very ill. Suddenly he said: A Taoist priest led a dog to feed me medicine, and I got better after sweating. Zhongxian Wang Han Qi also.</p>
<p>Wei Shanjun of the Tang Dynasty Wu Zetian Dynasty in Jingzhao fasted and practiced Taoism, and once carried a black dog named Niaolong, which is commonly called the Medicine King.</p>
<p>The surname of the Medical King is Wei, his name is Gu, his style is Teacher, and he is from the country of Shule. In the mid-summer of the Tang Kaiyuan period, people suffered from diseases, and he administered medicine everywhere, and all were cured. The emperor respected him. At that time, he was called the Medicine King.</p>
<p>The above can be seen in Tang Book Biographies of Fangji, Tongyin Old Stories, Biographies of Immortals, and Materia Medica. It can be seen that between the Tang and Song dynasties, Wei Xundao was already the domestic Medicine King of our country.</p>
<p>There is a Buddhist scripture called "Medicine King and Medicine Zang Bodhisattva Sutra." In the Lotus Sutra, there is a chapter called The Past Life of the Medicine King Bodhisattva, which is evidence that there is another Medicine King in Buddhism. I once found a picture of the Twenty-five Perfect Figures of the Ming Dynasty Five (Picture of the Medicine King Bodhisattva and the Medicine Zang Bodhisattva), and now I am printing it out as collateral evidence.</p>
<p>There is also a so-called Jiva (translated as Jicheng) in Buddhist scriptures, who is actually the Medicine King of India. All kinds of herbs and foods must be tried by him. This kind of situation is roughly the same as our country's records about Shennong.</p>
<h3>Shennong Stone Carving Image</h3>
<h3>Medicine King Medicine Zang Bodhisattva</h3>
<h3>A Brief Biography of Wei Xundao, Who Is Called the Medicine King Together with Shennong</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qingyun</p>
<p>Shennong being the Medicine King of our country is already very clear, but the world's use of Wei Xundao as the Medicine King has been circulating for a long time and cannot be overthrown. Therefore, there is a saying that "Shennong, Wei Xundao, and the Medicine King Bodhisattva" are one body. Examining the medical history of ancient and modern times records: "Wei Xundao, styled Cizang, was good at medicine and often brought a black dog with him to dispense medicine and help people. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang valued him and promoted him to an official, but he refused. He was admired by the world as the Medicine King." However, there are also errors in his book records, such as Wei Shanjun or Wei Guizang, and deliberately mythologize his saying, saying that "his black dog turned into a black dragon and carried him to heaven," etc., which is close to bizarre and untrustworthy.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of the Medicine Emperor's Mausoleum in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Jin Zheming</p>
<p>During the Southern Crossing of the Song Dynasty, Shang Li carried the statue of the Pihuang Temple to the Jiangting Pavilion on Chenghuang Mountain in Hangzhou. At that time, there was a patient who accidentally went to pray, and it felt very effective. It was regarded as the Shennong Temple, and the fire was extremely prosperous for a while. In the fourth year of Shaoding (1231), it was destroyed by fire; Lizong erected a new temple on the old site and named it "Huiling Temple." In August of the fifth year of Xianchun (1269), Empress Dowager Shouhe Shengfu bestowed silver to repair it, and painted twenty-four immortal doctors in the two wings, which people referred to as the predecessors who assisted Shennong in collecting medicine. In fact, what they worshiped were the Heavenly Master, Ying Bo, Bo Gao, Shao Shi, Tai Yi, Lei Gong, Yi Yin, Cang Gong, Hua Tuo, Huangfu Mi, Chao Yuanfang, Wei Sicang, Qian Yi, Liu Wansu, Li Guo, Gui Souqu, Yu Fu, Tong Jun, Ma Shuai, Shen Ying Wang Bian Que, Zhang Zhongjing, Wang Shuhe, Ge Hong, Sun Simiao, Wang Bing, Zhu Hong, Zhang Yuansu, Zhang Yanxiu, etc., all were predecessors in the ancient and medieval medical circles, and were not related to Shennong's collection of medicine. Huiling Temple suffered another fire disaster in the ninth year of Kangxi (1770). In the seventeenth year (1678), Li Shizhen spent money to rebuild it. In the twenty-first year of Jiaqing, (1816), it was rebuilt by pharmaceutical merchants. During the Daoguang period, it was repaired again. Later, the Hong Yang Rebellion destroyed the Temple Father. In the tenth year of Tongzhi (1871), it was rebuilt by pharmaceutical merchants in Hangzhou and renamed "Medicine Emperor Hall." During the reconstruction, the painted portraits of the twenty-four sages were reshaped into statues, and the statues of the Heavenly Doctor and Pihuang were added. According to the intention of the people at that time, Shennong was the first generation Medicine King, Pihuang was the second generation Medicine King, and the Heavenly Doctor was the third generation Medicine King. In fact, they were all arbitrarily fabricated and had no basis in historical facts. In front of the twenty-four statues in the temple, wooden tablets were erected, on which were written the titles and the diseases they were in charge of, all of which had no historical basis; so that the meaning of commemorating the sages was completely lost, and it became a place where ordinary superstitious patients prayed for immortal prescriptions, which is truly regrettable. Hangzhou was originally the base for the establishment of religion by gods. In that era of divine power, it was a natural trend for the Medicine King Temple to become a place of incense. Every year on the twenty-eighth day of April (lunar calendar), during the birthday of the Medicine King, all pharmaceutical farmers and merchants go up the mountain to burn incense and worship, and eat Tuckahoe cakes and other things to celebrate, which still does not lose the sincerity of commemorating the sages. After the Republic of China, it has not been held for many years.</p>
<h3>Four Kinds of Food</h3>
<p>— Song Zhaorong</p>
<p>The following foods are used as daily snacks and have the effect of treating diseases without any bias. They have been used for a long time and are very effective, so I specially introduce them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lily: Villagers often bring them to the market for sale, and they are very easy to buy. First separate each small petal, then remove the thin film around each small petal, stew until cooked, and add a little white sugar. It tastes very sweet. The common people regard white lily as a good product for treating long-term coughs and tuberculosis. In fact, it is not necessary to use white flowers. Anyone with weak lungs, who is prone to colds, or who suffers from coughs for a long time; or has developed tuberculosis and often coughs up blood, can use lily as a daily food, which is more effective than taking greasy products every day.</p>
<p>(2) Chinese Yam: Villagers also bring them to the market for sale. Eating them cooked is very effective in nourishing deficiency and reducing damage. National doctors also often use this in prescriptions: and it is even more effective in treating lower wasting, which is what Western medicine calls diabetes. Anyone who urinates immediately after drinking, a lot and turbidly, is a symptom of lower wasting. This product is not only an effective medicine for national doctors to treat lower wasting, but it is also more suitable as a daily food.</p>
<p>(3) Walnuts: Available in southern goods stores. It can nourish blood and brain. Those with less hair, who are not black, and are prone to hair loss, can mash it and take it regularly (or add red dates, longan, white sugar, etc.). It has miraculous effects. Elderly people with phlegm drinking disease, who cough and wheeze incessantly in winter, can mash this product, take one or two spoons a day and rinse it with boiled water. It has the effect of curing phlegm drinking. Those with weak spleen and stomach and loose stools can remove the oil floating on the upper part: those who catch a cold and cough and wheeze suddenly increase, can add one or two slices of old ginger for the best results.</p>
<p>(4) Job's Tears: Those with a humid constitution, thick and turbid tongue coating, or those with wet sores, can cook this and drink it regularly to gradually relieve the accumulation of dampness from urination. And according to recent research, it is said that its nourishing power is superior to all kinds of grains, and it can also treat pulmonary tuberculosis. Its benefits can be known.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>— (Editor)</p>
<p>The recently published "Drug Special Issue" has very rich content and includes manuscripts such as "History of Materia Medica." It is more interesting to read it here in commemoration of Shennong's birthday. The publishing house is at 76 Liumei Road. Please enclose one point of postage to request a copy.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Medicine King Bodhisattva</h3>
<p>— (Liu Zongzhou)</p>
<p>According to the "Medicine King and Medicine Superior Bodhisattva Sutra," in the distant past, there was a Buddha called "One Lapis Lazuli Light Illuminating Tathagata." The era was peaceful, and the country was named "Suspended Victory Banner." After that Buddha's Nirvana, during the Dharma Image Age, many Bhikkhus resolved to cultivate themselves. Among them, one Bhikkhu named "Sun Repository" was intelligent and wise, explaining the Great Vehicle's equality and great wisdom to all. At that time, there was also an elder named "Star Constellation Light," who, having heard of the Great Vehicle, was filled with joy. He then used Haritaki fruits and medicines to support the Bhikkhu Sun Repository and all. As a result, he developed a great Bodhi mind. At that time, Star Constellation Light's younger brother, named "Electric Light," also followed his brother, holding various good medicines, offering them to Sun Repository and all, and making great vows. Therefore, the assembly praised the brother as "Medicine King" and the younger brother as "Medicine Superior," who are the Medicine King and Medicine Superior Bodhisattvas of today. Later, the Medicine King cultivated pure conduct for a long time, made twelve great vows to save sentient beings from the source of disease, cure nameless chronic illnesses, and when all his vows were fulfilled, he became a Buddha in the future world, named "Pure Eye Tathagata," also known as "Medicine Master Lapis Lazuli Light Tathagata" or "Medicine Master King," and also called "Great Medicine King Buddha." (There is a jade-carved Medicine King Buddha statue in Siam), with his right shoulder bare, sitting in the lotus position, hand on knee, holding a pill, resembling a Sangha member.</p>

<h3>Englishmen Propose Presenting a Train</h3>
<p>British people deeply appreciate the benefits that trains bring to people, and are particularly regretful that they have not yet been implemented in China. Therefore, they have donated money to quickly build a train railway and present it to the court, hoping that the Emperor will personally see its convenience and precision, and then implement it in various places. The initiators of this undertaking are an English public figure named Mr. Sou Deli and a textile magnate named Mr. Bai En Da. A total of 60,000 gold dollars were used, equivalent to 200,000 taels of silver. Since it is presented as a gift for the Emperor's viewing, the beauty of the vehicles and the exquisiteness of the workmanship can be imagined. It was heard that there was such a proposal last month, but then the British people heard that there were plans to build a steam-powered railway along the route from Tianjin to the capital, so the previous proposal was temporarily suspended. Later, it was learned that this information was unsubstantiated, so the previous proposal was resumed. Currently, workers are being hired and materials are being purchased, and everyone is showing their skills, waiting for its completion, there will surely be something worth observing.</p>
<h3>Shandong to Establish a Manufacturing Plant</h3>
<p>Shandong Province is planning to establish a manufacturing plant similar to the Shanghai Arsenal. Yesterday, several commissioners from Guangdong came to Shanghai, sent by the Governor of Shandong, and will soon go to Shandong Province to discuss matters and make arrangements. It is also heard that the plant will most likely be located in Yantai.</p>
<h3>Strange Birth of a Fishing Woman</h3>
<p>Outside Qingtai Gate in Hangzhou, the wife of a fisherman named Yu was about to give birth. A few days ago, at night, she had excruciating abdominal pain. Yu immediately invited a midwife. Soon, a baby was born with a cry. The midwife looked at it and exclaimed in horror! Because the child had four horns on its head, no pair of eyes, a mouth on the tip of its nose, and spurs growing on its toes. What was even stranger was that its ears were as large as a pig's. Everyone who saw it was shocked. Its voice was very high-pitched and chirped like a bird. It died on the day of the full moon. This matter was witnessed by a friend from Hangzhou and is certainly not a fabrication. Some say that Yu laid his nets on the seawall, floating with his family, and was influenced by the Qi of a Jiaolong dragon, so this strange birth occurred.</p>

<h3>What is Expected of Readers of the Supplement</h3>
<p>— Shangqing</p>
<p>This is not me being mysterious, nor am I exaggerating: if it is correct to say that the importance of contributors to a supplement is greater than that of the editor, then the importance of readers is greater than that of contributors, especially so. The reason is very simple: the editor is the distributor, the contributor is the supplier, and the reader is the demander. According to the general rule, demand can determine everything, so readers can also influence editors and contributors. In addition, readers make up the absolute majority, readers are the public, and editors and contributors must obey them.</p>
<p>Since readers have supreme authority over a supplement, I especially want to express my hopes to them.</p>
<p>There are many readers, mostly young students, who think that editors and contributors are always talented people, their articles are always good, and their opinions are always correct. Therefore, sometimes when they see works that are truly incomprehensible or contrary to their own ideas, they gloss over them and dare not ask questions. This is not right. They should recognize that editors and contributors are by no means perfect geniuses and always have shortcomings, so I hope that such readers will not be self-deprecating.</p>
<p>However, there are many readers, mostly older, but also some younger, who are the opposite of the former. They think that editors are always muddleheads and contributors are always mediocre. They don't even bother to glance at their supplement. They want the editor to consult them and other contributors to wait respectfully for them to be satisfied. This is also not right. After all, the establishment of a supplement must have its reasons for existence. It is not possible to dismiss its editors and contributors in this way, so I hope that such readers will not be arrogant.</p>
<p>Readers who are neither self-deprecating nor arrogant are proper readers. I hope that if they have any opinions about a supplement, in other words, about the editor or contributors of that supplement, they can express them as much as possible. The way to do this is to write a letter to the editor or to become a contributor themselves and submit an article. In this way, the editor and other contributors will certainly benefit from your opinions, and all readers, including yourself, will be positively influenced by you.</p>
<p>When you express your opinions in this way, you will naturally know that you should state what you disapprove of and what you hope for; you will naturally also know that you should not be timid or overzealous, but speak calmly and rationally. This is the attitude you should take, and you know it, so I don't need to say more. But when you use this attitude to express your opinions, especially when writing a letter to the editor, I hope you will have the following two resolutions:</p>
<p>Accepting goodness. If you realize that you are wrong, you will be willing to retract your opinion and will definitely not argue unreasonably or become angry and create useless and harmful trouble for both sides. Because the supplement belongs to the public, the public will never allow you to act selfishly.</p>
<p>Rejecting evil. Conversely, if you find that you are not wrong, I hope you will persist and repeatedly state your case to achieve your goal, or at least to make the supplement you are paying attention to modify itself to a point where it is somewhat satisfactory. Because the supplement belongs to the public, the public will naturally support your legitimate demands.</p>
<p>Of course, I know that the difficulty lies in not knowing whether your own opinion is wrong. Therefore, I hope that you will not express your opinion until you are fully confident and fully understand a problem. When you have real insight, you will then put your attitude and resolution into practice.</p>
<p>In short, I hope that every reader of a supplement will treat the supplement they are reading as their own property and imagine themselves as the editor or the contributor. You must cherish it: if it is good, you must promote and magnify it; if it is not good, you must correct it and help it. Every proper supplement is always willing to hear the opinions of its readers, and I hope that you will fulfill your responsibility as a reader and satisfy it.</p>
<p>It is true that a supplement can guide readers; however, it is also true that readers can promote a supplement. Only when readers and the supplement cooperate, that is, cooperate with the editors and contributors, can both the supplement and the readers benefit.</p>
<p>Think about it: which supplement should be promoted and magnified? Which supplement should be corrected or helped? I hope that you will put it into practice as soon as you think of it!</p>
<h3>Presenting a Flag</h3>
<p>— Shengdan</p>
<p>—Battlefield Notes—</p>
<p>Returning from Macheng to Songbu, the sky was pouring rain. A truck used for transportation was racing through the muddy night, staggering like a drunkard. We didn't bring rain gear, so we had to huddle together, covering ourselves with dirty tarpaulins. But the rain was getting heavier and heavier, as if a waterfall was pouring down and a river was flowing backwards, soaking us from head to toe, like drowned rats. However, thinking of the brave fighters in the trenches, even when it rained and the water was over their knees, they still maintained their spirits and composure; therefore, we were not only calm in the face of the storm, but also grateful for the kindness of heaven in washing away our travel dust.</p>
<p>The truck drove into the heavily wooded military supervisory department. Councilor Chen had already prepared dinner; after dinner, I brought up the topic of rural visits and told him about it. Director Zheng of the military supervisory department had also served in military transportation during the Northern Expedition. According to him, the most distinctive political work was done by the Eighth Route Army, and the promotion in Guangxi was exemplary. He said that the achievements in Macheng were certainly satisfactory. "The 'anti-bandit' movement cannot succeed without the cooperation of the common people!" he said firmly.</p>
<p>Councilor Chen was quite talkative, speaking with a strong Chongming accent, similar to Cao Juren's Pujiang accent, with a "same tune played differently" feel. It was truly unexpected to be able to share a bed with him in the wind and rain amidst the raging flames of war.</p>
<p>"There's no problem with Tianjiazhen, Wuhan won't waver."</p>
<p>"Even if there is a problem, we will never abandon Wuhan!"</p>
<p>That's how the conversation ended that night. So, the evacuation of Wuhan depended on Guangzhou. Otherwise, the three towns would not have fallen so quickly. The next morning, we prepared to refresh ourselves and decided to go to Huangchuan. At this time, the battle on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway had unfolded with extreme intensity, and rumors even spread that Xinyang was about to be abandoned. "Once they step into the Dabie Mountains, it's no different from sinking into a quagmire. They can only become ghosts in a foreign land and can never hope to return alive," said Director Zheng, a happy smile flitting across his round face. But just as we were about to bid farewell to Songbu, the military supervisory department received a telegram from Huangchuan, informing us that General Li Zongren would be coming to Hubei soon, and the news that the cultural circles of Wuhan would be coming to comfort the troops was also confirmed at the same time. This was truly unexpected good news. Apart from Lao Yao and me, the other seven were all representatives of the people of Anhui Province, and their mission was to present a flag to pay their respects. After the event, they would still have to return to Anhui, so we traveled together.</p>
<p>Just two hours later, General Li had returned from the front, looking heroic, spirited, and not at all tired. After resting for a while, he met with the representatives presenting the flag. His dignified and amiable attitude could not help but inspire respect.</p>
<p>"Ah, ah! You've worked so hard!" General Li said first, smiling warmly.</p>
<p>"We should have come to the front to present the flag. Please forgive us, Commander!"</p>
<p>Miss Wu apologized on behalf of everyone, and in a solemn ceremony, she presented the red silk flag. Then, she expressed the heartfelt support of the people of Anhui in simple and clear language, and then bid farewell and left. "A great leader of the national resistance!" Miss Wu praised sincerely.</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Journey</h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Like those with eccentricities, I like the wilderness, the primitive mountains and forests. The sea is also something I love, especially on a calm beach when the wind has died down and the waves have receded. But I also followed the trend of modern poets, visiting places like the Longevity Hill, Yuelu Mountain, and West Lake, but I never got any noteworthy impressions. Accompanied by urban society, these travels often become so formulaic that one feels a sense of "unease" if one is short of even a penny, like going to a Cantonese teahouse and sitting in a five- or seven-point hall. When I pick up a pen to write travel notes about these places, the mountains must be "sturdy," the clouds must be "thick," and the streams must be "gurgling." Without this kind of style, the travel notes lack artistic charm.</p>
<p>But to look at famous scenic spots with Zola's glasses is intentionally ruining Zola's name. Originally, travel notes were a shallow term. To write novels as travel notes or to write travel notes as novels is both meddling.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>In April 1938, I made my first tour of Mount Heng, accompanied only by the Peng brothers, Qi Xing and Zhen, who were from Guangdong.</p>
<p>Traveling with people from other provinces, due to differences in language and perceptions, one feels more novelty compared to locals. Their hometown was in Lufeng. They had drifted here from their address in Guangzhou, partly to avoid the bombing and partly to find friends. Outwardly, they seemed fortunate, but inwardly, they harbored endless sadness.</p>
<p>From Chongshan County to Hengshan Town, the twenty-minute car ride was silent, as if we were going to a funeral. The scenery on both sides of the road was monotonous—mountain ranges, mountain ranges, mountain ranges, but covered with the tender green of spring, as if telling a beginner in watercolor to use more yellow and green paint on the paper. Among the passengers were wounded soldiers, refugees, resident gentry, small merchants, old farmers, and county officials with horse faces. Hengshan Town was not small, comparable in size to Haidian in Beijing or Jiangwan Town in Shanghai. There was a park on the eastern side, still under construction. The stone archway inscribed by Liu Yinggu had been standing for six or seven years. Facing south, there was Yuyun School, resembling a wealthy person's villa. Near the town, there was a public sports ground with slogans in white characters on a blue background, suddenly adding a kind of spiritual excitement to passersby. We transferred from the bus station to the main street, silently aware of the shops along the street, walking unevenly, following the ups and downs of the stone slabs. After a long time, we found a restaurant with a newly changed signboard.</p>
<p>The owner was from Xiangtan. He recited the names of the dishes to us like a schoolboy reciting the Thousand Character Classic.</p>
<p>We casually ordered three dishes and spread out a map of Mount Heng, discussing how to proceed like a group of staff officers. The Xiangtan owner brought the tea and told us casually, "One day is not enough for a visit. One day is just running around. Two days is just looking at the mountains. Three days allows you to see the temples. Five or six days is enough to write poetry or paint seven or eight percent of a mustard garden. It depends on what you gentlemen plan to do. We can hire sedan chairs for you here."</p>
<p>The Xiangtan "wanderer" had some descriptive skills. We couldn't help but let his experience determine the length of our trip.</p>
<p>Seeing that the two Pengs were from other provinces, the Xiangtan owner said to them:</p>
<p>"Since Boss He (referring to He Jian) took charge a few years ago, Mount Heng has really been worth a visit. There is a fixed price for riding a sedan chair, and a fixed price of one yuan a day for staying in a temple, big or small. In the beginning, it was more than ten folds per li, resting every eight or nine steps, but now it's different. You can really race on the road. In the beginning, not a single hair grew on Mount Heng. There was no tree left even where there was soil. Now, there are various planting associations managing it. In the beginning, the temples were crooked and dilapidated, leaking when it rained and letting in wind. The big monks extorted money, and the small monks stole. Now, all the temples have been renovated, and the monks are all high-class. In the beginning, you had to put up your feet when it was dark, and you would either see tigers or encounter robbers. Now, there are police patrolling every day, and even beggars have been driven away..."</p>
<p>His description made us really feel the extraordinary nature of Mount Heng. We increased our interest a lot.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Mount Heng was originally famous for being barren. There are too many barren peaks. Apart from the lush greenery in the valleys and the solitary pines standing upright among the rocks, there is little grass. The newly planted saplings are also withered and do not grow. The places with forests, flowers, streams are mostly owned by wealthy people and monks, as if even the few birds are like ladies of the house. The water flowing from Lusi Pool and Huayan Lake flows straight down the rocks along the road. Looking back to the source, it is really unknown where it comes from and where it flows to. No wonder there are flash floods, and it can only be allowed to flood the fields, even drowning water buffalo.</p>
<p>Some of the construction is clearly very clumsy. I found a large bridge connecting the east and west cliffs. Strangely enough, they built it like a pile of walls, without opening any holes. Where does the water flow through? They had to destroy the bricks and stones, demolishing a project that had cost tens of thousands of yuan, even washing away the roads on both sides. How clumsy is that!</p>
<p>There are no other kinds of buildings in this area. The Cantonese don't understand what's good about this situation. I boredly bragged a little, saying:</p>
<p>"Historically, this mountain is very famous. According to legend, Dayu came here to control the floods. About twenty miles from here, there is a temple called Guangji Temple. Next to it is the Yuhuang City, which was left to commemorate him. This is a game from prehistoric times. Later, there were many people who left their fragrance on the mountain, including those from the Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties. This is probably very reliable. If we walk another six or seven miles, we will reach Bianshan Pavilion, where we can find Li Jing's place of seclusion."</p>
<p>The Cantonese are not very interested in history. They mostly moved from ancient environments to the Lingnan area. By custom, they only understand whether a place has production and whether it has practical benefits. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>(III) The Source of Love</h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>If I give away all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. For love does not boast, and love is the greatest of the three elements indispensable to life: faith, hope, and love. Love does no harm to others. With love, one can be all-encompassing. Hatred stirs up strife, while love covers over all wrongs. I hope that those who run schools in this world can practice education of love, that hospitals can be hospitals of love, and that people can treat each other with equal love. But unfortunately, people do not know what love is! For the love that can be found in this world is nothing more than one-sided, narrow, conditional, carnal, and relative! Therefore, I now introduce to readers the source of true love. The Bible says: "God is love. God sent his son Jesus Christ into the world. While we were still sinners, Jesus died for us. God's love has been demonstrated to us in this way. Because love comes from God, everyone who loves is born of God and knows God." God's love began to flow when Jesus died on the cross for sinners. I wonder, reader, are you willing to receive the irrigation of this great source of love? Are you willing to let Christ dwell in your heart through your faith, so that your love may be rooted and grounded, and you may live a life of love?</p>

<h3>A Precious Program from a "Feng Family Home Performance"</h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>Random Memories of the Plum Blossom, Part Three</p>
<p>Since Master Plum Blossom published the sensational theater news in this publication, until this publication stated that the so-called "Bai Family Home Performance was canceled due to the obstruction of General Wu Ziyu," in these few days, it stirred up a storm in the entire theater world of the isolated island! Theater fans and non-theater fans alike told each other, as if they had obtained a treasure. I knew that it was far from the truth and did not make any statement on behalf of Mr. Mei Lanfang, because in such a gloomy and suffocating environment, it was better to give the masses of the isolated island a stimulating stimulant. Just like the news of the conflict between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo, why necessarily say that it is a "rumor" and disappoint people!</p>
<p>The sensational theater news mentioned Ms. Feng Biqi. This time, I recalled the grand occasion of the Feng family home performance in the eighth and ninth years of the Republic of China. Ms. Feng's husband was Mr. Feng Youwei, the former "President of the Central Bank." Mr. Feng was a lifelong confidant of Mr. Mei, and Mr. Mei has achieved what he is today thanks to Mr. Feng's guidance, teaching, and advice. That year's home performance was for the 70th birthday of Madam Feng. All the first-class celebrities of old Beijing, except for Wang Yaoqing, Shang Xiaoyun, and Ma Lianliang, who seemed to be out of town and were not invited, and everyone else from all branches such as sheng, dan, jing, mo, chou, martial sheng, martial dan, and hua dan, can be said to have been gathered almost completely, a great collection of talents. At that time, Shu Yan's reputation was not as great as it is today. And Cheng Yanqiu had not yet warmly praised the Mei School for many days, and he was just recovering from a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>Now, I am submitting the program from that Feng family home performance to the Performing Arts World to be printed below. The old actors in the program, such as Tian Guifeng, Sun Juxian, Gou Yunfu, Chen Delin, Qiu Guixian, Liu Hongsheng, Yang Xiaolou, Li Shoushan, Qian Jinfu, Wang Changlin, Yu Zutong, etc., have mostly become historical figures. It is really not easy to gather such a grand home performance again in the present. We can only let the pigtail master and the dog meat general enjoy it!</p>
<p>The calligraphy on this program is strong, graceful, neat, and meticulous. It was originally written by the great poet and celebrity Mr. Luo Yinggong. (The original is currently stored in Mr. Mei's Zhu Yuxuan.) Mr. Luo's tomb is already overgrown with trees, so this program is even more precious and cherished.</p>
<h3>Gloria Stuart's Whereabouts After Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xinying</p>
<p>Feels Unusually Interesting About This "Paris of the East"</p>
<p>The news about Hollywood movie star Gloria Stuart and her husband Joseph Scheckman arriving in Shanghai has already been published in this publication. What is said here is about their whereabouts on the day of their arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Gloria Stuart was particularly interested in everything about Shanghai, this Paris of the East. And in recent days, she has been quite busy shopping in various stores and attending receptions from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, she can be considered the second famous Hollywood actress to come to Shanghai. (The first was Jenifer Torrens who passed through last month). According to her conversation with reporters on the day of her arrival in Shanghai, she will stay in Shanghai for a week this time.</p>
<p>It is said that the new film "Winner Take All" starring Gloria Stuart, produced by 20th Century Fox, will be released in this city at the end of the month, and another new film of hers, "It Could Happen to You," was written by her husband Scheckman. She had just finished filming it before leaving Hollywood, and it will also be released in this city at the end of July.</p>
<p>However, it is a pity that she and her husband will only stay in Shanghai for a week and will not be able to witness the grand occasion of her starring films being released in Shanghai! After leaving Shanghai, the two of them will travel to Hong Kong, Indochina, and the East Indies, and then return to the United States via Europe to complete their attempt to travel around the world.</p>
<h3>Gao Zhanfei and Bai Yang Have Not Yet Arrived in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Yusheng</p>
<p>But There Is Indeed News of Their Return to Shanghai in the Short Term</p>
<p>There are rumors outside that Gao Zhanfei and Bai Yang have arrived in Hong Kong together and have been surrounded by various film companies in Hong Kong. Yesterday, after reporters inquired from various sources, it was proven that Gao Zhanfei and Bai Yang are still staying in Sichuan, but there is indeed news that they will leave for Shanghai in the short term. It would be too early to say that they have already arrived in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Last year, a representative from Xinhua Film Company was in Chongqing and specially contacted Bai Yang, inviting Bai Yang to join Xinhua to make movies after returning to Shanghai in the future. Bai Yang accepted this request. With a prior agreement in place, Bai Yang's return to Shanghai will be a boost to Xinhua.</p>
<p>As for Gao Zhanfei, he used to star in "The Great Pirate of the Yellow Sea" for Xinhua. Now that he and Bai Yang are traveling together, if Bai Yang joins Xinhua, Lao Gao will of course "follow in."</p>
<p>What is worrying is the question of Gao Qianping. In the past, everyone called them "Lao Gao and Xiao Gao" together. Now that Lao Gao and Bai Yang are about to arrive in Shanghai, I wonder what attitude Gao Qianping will show?</p>
<h3>The Extraordinary Woman of the Silver Screen: Anecdotes of Joan Crawford</h3>
<p>— Feng Xiang</p>
<p>Her Boyfriend's Arms Often Serve as a Temporary Cradle; Her Divorced Husband Remains Inextricably Linked</p>
<p>Miss Joan Crawford, renowned in the film world, loathes sleep more than anything in life. She rarely occupies her bed at night, because the kind of "spirited" nightlife in Hollywood is too alluring to let go of. However, sleep is a physiological necessity for the body to replenish its energy and recover from fatigue, which no one can avoid. Therefore, Miss Crawford has developed another habit in this environment: whether at social gatherings or on the film set, she can take a nap anytime, anywhere, and her boyfriend's arms often serve as her temporary cradle.</p>
<p>Recently, Miss Crawford arrived in New York from Hollywood with her beloved pug. The first thing she did upon arriving in New York was to meet with Franchot Tone, her ex-husband from whom she had divorced years ago, at a nightclub for a memorial dinner. As the band played melodious songs, the question arose whether this divorce was a "breakdown or termination of love." In any case, this kind of "unsevered lotus root" anecdote can only be performed by this extraordinary woman of the silver screen.</p>

<p>A Scene from "The Cloud Fairy," China's First Singing and Passionate Masterpiece, Will Be Showing at the Heguang and Xinguang Theatres from the 16th</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden (Opera World)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>It's a Pity that Sun Yukun and Hou Xirui Have Fallen So Low</p>
<p>Later, even his few assistants gradually scattered. For a Wusheng (male martial role) performer, without capable assistants and having to find new partners temporarily, there will never be a brilliant performance. Currently, there is a great lack of talent in Wusheng roles. Sheng Chun and Sheng Bin are still too immature. Yukun does resemble Yu Yang somewhat. If he can reinvigorate himself and come to the South to perform, I think everyone who misses Xiao Lou will praise him.</p>
<p>Hou Xirui was a top student in the first class of the Fu Liancheng Opera School. Not only was he one of the best students in the "Xi" class, but he was also on par with Shouchen in the Jing (painted-face male) roles in Tianjin and Beijing. When Cheng Yanqiu was just emerging, he enjoyed great fame with "The Legend of Hong Fu." The role of Qiu Ran Ke (Bearded Man) in the play was played by Xirui. His martial arts skills were excellent, surpassing Shao Shan and Shouchen. At the same time, his singing was also very steady and flavorful, so his portrayal of Qiu Ran Ke was very fitting. Yanqiu himself also felt that the play could not achieve a mutually enhancing effect without Xirui in the role. Last year, I met Yanqiu at a gathering with old friend Jiang Zicheng, with Miao Xiang and Shao Lou also present. I asked why he didn't perform "The Legend of Hong Fu" this time coming south. He replied that there was no one who could play Qiu Ran Ke. I then asked about Jiang Shao Kui. Yanqiu smiled and said, "Shao Kui is not a hero, but a robber." From this, we can see how much Yanqiu admired Xirui's art. However, Cheng, Hou, Guo (Zhongheng), Wang (Youquan), and Zhou (Ruian) have not collaborated since their breakup, so Yanqiu's play has never been performed again.</p>
<p>After leaving Cheng's opera troupe, Xirui's value decreased day by day. Whenever theaters in Beijing posted performances of "Fa Men Si," regardless of whether the lead was an amateur, a professional, a male actor, or a female actor, as long as they paid him a few dollars to sing, he would accept. Even if he had to rush to several theaters in a day, he didn't feel it was beneath him. At the same time, Hao Shouchen would only perform with Xiao Lou and Qing Kui for a fee of one hundred and sixty yuan or at least one hundred yuan, and he had to be paid in advance. Therefore, the value and reputation of Hao and Hou gradually differed greatly. Not only was Xirui's artistic reputation declining, but his personal life was also very depraved. In addition to being addicted to gambling and opium, he also liked to frequent third-rate opera houses when he had nothing to do, so much so that no one in the industry would pay attention to him anymore. Even if they happened to meet and walk together, they were afraid of being implicated. (3/7)</p>
<h3>Li Dashen Goes to Hong Kong to Await Instructions; Chen Yunshang Will Return to Shanghai in Five Weeks</h3>
<p>— (Yindi)</p>
<p>The "Romance of the Western Chamber" Incident Lyrics Resolved</p>
<p>After completing "The Cloud Fairy," Chen Yunshang returned home in triumph and went south to Hong Kong. During her two-month stay, film companies in Hong Kong invited her to make films one after another, including Cantonese films, Mandarin films, and even English films, keeping her very busy. Originally, Chen Yunshang's position in the Hong Kong film industry was below that of Li Qinian, but now she has surpassed her and become more popular than Li Qinian.</p>
<p>Recently, due to rumors that the Hong Kong Cantonese film company had invited Chen Yunshang to film "Romance of the Western Chamber," Xinhua Company specially sent its distribution director, Li Dashen, to Hong Kong to prevent this. This is because Xinhua Company had commissioned Ouyang Yuqian to write the script for "Romance of the Western Chamber" half a year ago, also planning to have Chen Yunshang star in it. Secondly, Chen Yunshang has a contract with Xinhua, and she cannot film randomly without seeking the consent of her colleagues at Xinhua. These are the two reasons why Xinhua wants to prevent Chen Yunshang from filming "Romance of the Western Chamber" in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Now, Li Dashen has reported back to Shanghai that the "Romance of the Western Chamber" incident is expected to be resolved (probably the Mandarin film will be stopped, and only the Cantonese film will be made). Chen Yunshang will likely stay in Hong Kong for another five weeks before returning to Shanghai again to fulfill her contract with Xinhua. Li Dashen will serve as the "minister in charge of defending the territory" and stay in Hong Kong, waiting for Chen Yunshang to finish filming her several pre-scheduled films, and then accompany her back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Due to the congestion of advertisements today, the Chess Garden will be temporarily suspended for one day. (Editor)</p>
