<h3>上海敎育現階段的檢討</h3>
<p>敎育決不是一個不重要的問題。日前正是學校快要放暑假的時候，也就是學年快要更始的時候，敎育界一定在籌劃着調整和進展的工作，我們在這進修來檢討一下敎育問題，也算得是很需要的。不過敎育的範圍很廣泛，現在所檢討的，祇限於上海敎育現階段的種種問題。</p>
<p>八一三開戰到今將近兩年、就是上海市陷落到現在，也已有十九個月了。這十九個月裏，政府的領導作用雖暫時感受困難，但市民的民族意識和國家觀念，却依然非常强固。這五百萬市民意志的長城建築在什麼上面？無疑地，那弦歌不輟的敎育事業，就是最重要的基礎。再則自中日開戰以來，侵略者每到一地，不惜用種種手段摧毀文化機關；但是等到需要遮掩世人耳目的進修，却又不惜用種種手段，愚惑靑年，假手偽組織，推行其所謂偽敎育。上海市初告陷落的時候，敎育界苦心孤詣，維持着敎育事業，使上海的一般靑年和兒童不致失學，不啻在黑暗世界裏燃起了一把火炬。等到淪陷地域和上海間漸决發生交通的時候，各地避難民衆，絡繹到滬。上海的學校裏又充分吸收着來滬的靑年和兒童，使他們脫離順民敎育的危境，仍舊接受着中華民國的國家敎育。由於這樣的兩種事實，可見上海敎育界在十九多月裏如何苦心支撑，應付危局，他們對於國家民族的勞績，實在不可泯滅，我們應該深致無限的崇敬與同情。</p>
<p>兩年來的上海敎育界，不但在事實上表露了苦心支撑的現象，而且在精神上也屢屢在危疑震撼之中，展開了積極的鬥爭姿態。去年春季，僞組織方面即開始企圖奪取上海敎育沒有成功；現在却更引起了在精衛派的覬覦。原來在精衛的黨羽裏，很有一些與敎育界向有淵源的人，因此社會便屢起在派收買敎育界的傳說，繪影繪聲，說得若有其事；但是直到今日，傳說儘管是傳說，上海敎育界裏幸未曾發現過那樣的事實。所以我們對於上海敎育界的認識大體，明辨是非，不受誘脅，守正不阿，也感到無限的欽佩</p>
<p>然而我們也不必諱言，這兩年來的上海敎育並不十分健全。不健全的事例不止一端，綜合起來的有兩點：一曰量的發展過於質的充實；二曰凌亂不和諧的現象掩蓋了協力同心的精神。</p>
<p>所謂量的發展，表現在兩個方面，一即學校數量的增加，二即每校學生數的激增，這是很普遍的事實，不必列舉統計數字才能知道。量的發展固然自有其社會原因，根本並不是壞現象：然而如果質的充實不能與之配合，那就是所謂畸形的發展。我們試一檢討，上海現在各校的設備，大都窳陋非常，同時敎員的待遇又比較戰前相差太遠，以致學校內容精神，難期飽滿。雖說目前各校很多為房租所累，然而我們知道也有許多學校並不累於房租，但也並沒有注意質的充實，即使眞為房租所累的，也未必能够撙節不必要的消费，谋学校设備等方面的基本充實。</p>
<p>所謂凌亂不和諧的現象，分析起來有下列各方面：一，學校與學生之間學校對學生的管理非常鬆懈，缺乏積極的統一性的指導，學生有良好的組織動機，學校不能積極領導；學生發生不良傾向時，學校又不能作有理性的制裁。二，學校敎職員之間傾軋互訐的風氣，旣屢屢發見；釀成風潮的事實，也疊有所聞。三，學校與學校這間辦法　彼此不一，標榜就各有不同，嫉忌攻擊在所難免，尤其在放假招生的時候，表現得非常明顯。四，學校對於社會雖說上海敎育界已盡了指導巿民民族意識的責任，但實際上對於社會的領導作用還嫌不夠，例如不良風俗的糾正，濟難運動的展開，精神總動員的實施，學校都未能發揮最前綫的機能。五，學校對於國家課程標準未能完全遵照，導師制度未冊普遍實施，都顯得上海敎育界還沒有完全恪遵政府的功令，忠實執行國家敎育的任務。</p>
<p>上面所舉的不健全的兩點，實在是現代敎育，也就是資本主義敎育的普遍缺點。不過以前有政府機關監督指導，所以很少暴露的機會；現在因爲未能得到政府充分的領導，這種缺點便充分表暴了。敎育和政治原有不可分離的關係，所以上海敎育現階段缺點的癥結，還是由於政治上的原因。然而我們現在正要發揮上海敎育界乃至市民的自治精神、民族精神，把一切缺點糾正過來，即使形式上未得政府的充分領導，但是事實上決不表露無政府的狀態。</p>
<p>去年十月問，本報社評曾經指出，要糾正當前上海敎育的缺點：一，應該由各校組織聯合機關，用集體的力量，代行政府的領導作用；二，建設健全的社會輿論，作有力的監督與指導。現在雖時隔數月。我們覺得還是應該適用此兩方法；不過在此學年更始的時候。各校更應該自行檢討，個別努力、作爲聯合組織的基礎。</p>
<p>復决，上海敎育界雖在目前表示着不爲威脅，不爲利誘，不屈服於惡勢力之下：但是以後對方的進攻也必然會加緊起來；上海敎育界工作的艱苦也必然會加深起來。所以現在每一個學校，應該自我檢討一下，澈底實行思想上的肅反和預防工作。以前學校裘每逢放假。往往把個人小節的拘謹與吾，作爲學生操行評判的標準，又往往把情感的好惡，作爲敎員人事調整的標準，現在却應該注意思想的傾向，把思想的正確與吾，作爲進退黜陟的尺度。這可以說是一種爲國家爲民族的必要措置，請上海敎育界注意。</p>
<h3>對日關係益緊張英正草擬新通牌駁斥日對租界要求駐日大使訪問有田談英武官被捕問題</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英日關係之緊張局勢、頃已更趨嚴重、蓋英國政府當局、現正草擬新通牒、駁斥日方對租界之要求也、聞該項通牒在上星期業已準備草擬、然爲明瞭日方企圖計、延至最近始行起草、大抵其所有詞句、均屬異常確定而難以誤解者、故將來日方、苟若再行侵害英人之生命財產、則英國政府必當予以報復、又據英外交部方面消息、英國駐滬總領事、曾於昨日下午、爲日軍「無理」猛刺英僑丁格勒一事、提出書面抗議、並保留要求賠償之權利、據悉英方之所以準備報復、實由於　日入封鎖中國海岸、　日方在佔領區域內、推行反英運動、　日方「限制」在華英僑之利益、（十日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>外匯市場大定　主要匯率無變更　數日來之激動歸諸消失　日圓行市昨又低於法幣</h3>
<p>（本報重慶十日電）記者以近日外滙市價發生波動、特向財政部探詢、據該部發言人答稱如下、　維持法幣、爲華政府旣定政策、最近外滙平衡基金管理委會對於調整外匯市價所運用方法、既未變更政府之政策、且係政府核準之措置、　因進出口季節關係、目前進口增多、尤以非必需品之輸入為甚、故調整外匯市價、使之合乎於我經濟有利之標準、維持國際收支之平衡更能鞏固外匯市況、　政府維持法幣法價、抗戰前後、始終未變、自管理外匯以還、公私機關正當需要外匯、經財部核准者、均由中央銀行按照法價售給、事實昭著、至市價與法價發生差異、外滙旣經管理、此種現象、不特我國爲然、　政府爲减少市面波動、迭經飭由銀行維持、成績頗佳、迨外匯平衡基金管委會成立後、管理機關更臻完善、維持實力、允見增加、　邇來政府更力謀减少非必需品之進口、並多方設法鼓勵出口、同時節省外滙用途、冀以裨益我國之經濟、而適應抗戰之需要、而平衡基金管委會之實力、亦足穩定市况、余固深信各方對於法幣之信心、更能增厚、絕不致因目前市面之波動而受影響也、</p>
<p>（本報十日香港電）法幣價格、已趨穩定、據負責方面發表意見、謂在過去數週間、平衡外滙基金、并無感受任何壓力、國幣信用、亦無動搖、此爲所共見者然而平衡基金委員會於星期三日暫行停止維持、好使大洋之外匯價格、達到★更佳的經濟水準、庶使對外貿易、得以平衡、猶憶一九三八年六月類似的辦法、曾亦採行、直至達到八辨士又四分之一之水準時、此項價格、遂繼續維持十二閱月而無變動、深信新的水準、現在經已獲得、并能堅固保持許多物品前係屬於舶來者、現已可在國內製造、據各方報告、本年預期之豐收、對於低减進口可有補助、政府購買軍火及其他物品所需之外滙、經已決定辦法、不致影響於外滙市塲、最後平衡外滙基金旣已充厚擴展此基金基礎之努力、亦已成功、當局維持外匯之力量、實屬不成問題目前雖有滙率水準之變動、但國幣富仍繼續獲得民衆之信任、蓋外滙自由交易、時時的獲得保證也云云、</p>
<p>主要匯率昨無變動</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（十日）晨本埠匯市平靜、主要匯率、實與昨日（九日）無變動、已往數日內之激動、已歸消失、商業自行調整、以應新狀况、但照行市新水準購買之外匯、仍在狹隘之限度以內、上海之輸入品、並無遽即减少之望、已往數月內、已向海外訂購種種入口貨物、爲數頗巨、大多數商人已照以前匯率預購外匯、償付此等入口品之貨價，允以棉花爲然、目前代本埠紗廠訂購之原棉、殆可應付至下月底爲止之需要、其外滙亦已結出、故此後六星期內自印度與美國運來之大批原棉、當係八便士五之匯率</p>
<p>日圓行市低於法幣</p>
<p>謠傳本埠銀行人員於已往三日內處理匯兌局勢、有失正規云云、今仍未息但事實上此種謠諑、似屬無稽、全滬對香港基金之舉動、事前均無所知、若干銀行因已處過量售出之地位、致損失不貲、今晨此間滙市中、日元行市復低於法幣、兌換店以九角九分二收進日元、而以九角九分七五售出、今晨較早時、日元滙率、買進爲法幣一元零一分、售出爲一元〇二分、十盎斯金條今晨復創新高價、計二千四百六十六元、</p>
<p>匯豐供給黑市穩定　匯　等銀行對於正當商人需要外滙、仍負責儘量供給、惟須憑各行之定貨單、自實行之後、投機家無法操縱滙市、日方之套買外滙計劃失敗、同時中國之入超、亦能减少、上海之黑市混亂狀態、業已消滅、外滙價格、亦趨穩定、昨日滙豐銀行公佈之行市、英滙爲六辨士半、美匯爲十二元六二五、與八九兩日相同、</p>
<p>平準委員竭力維持　外雁平準委員會對於上海黑市塲之外滙、決定竭力設法繼續維持、此决滙豐齦行等限制供給外匯、或即係該委員會授意辦理、該委員會將於黑市外滙至水平綫時、即行恢復供給外匯、至於水平錢行市、爲局外人所不知、外傳財政部將公佈水平綫行市之說、據外滙某專家之觀察、決非事實、黑市之外匯行市不致再行下跌</p>
<p>中國金融收益匪淺　新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、此决上海黑市外滙之緊縮、各業商人、雖或有受到損失、但是項措施、與中國整個金融、受益匪淺、過去日本貨物之輸入中國、竟佔各國之第一位、以今年一月至四月計算、値國幣九千八百五十三萬八千元、日本商人將貨出售後、取得之法幣、向黑市套買外滙、以致中國鉅額外滙漏巵、嗣後則日方勢將無法套買、</p>
<p>日商在華訂購棉　日本在華各紗廠將中國棉花鉅量輸日、充足工業及軍火原料、例如去年輸出値國幣一千一百萬元、同時向印度等處訂購外棉運華、供給日商紗廠紡細紗之用、今年一月至四月已進口棉花、値國幣三千八百八十七萬元、是項棉花進口之外滙、均係向上海黑市塲套買、惟此後之外棉輸入中國、勢必受外滙緊縮之影響、</p>
<p>港方傾塞匯市轉定　據新新社記者探悉、日來滙豐銀行繼續負責維持供給正當需要、同時香港方面、昨日已有大量外滙電滬傾塞、因此某方雖採用各種方法、從事活動、企圖吸收、擾亂滙市、但平準會新措施眞相已明、人心轉定故滙市已呈平定狀態、</p>
<p>日方死力圖扒外匯　大陸報云、上海滙市咋日（九日）全日之大部分雖不活躍、但昨晚收盤時頗見安定、橫濱正金銀行之經紀人昨曾死力扒進其所能獲得之外滙、該銀行上夜曾收到託購外滙之成單、逾美金六十萬元、但據可靠消息、此等成單、多未履行、且似將長此擱置也、若干消息靈通之經紀界人士承認日方昨確已設法獲得若干外滙、以償付棉値、但定本月內與七月中運來上海之印棉、需要大量外滙、償付其値而昨日所得外滙、總數甚微、殊不足應付也、</p>
<p>日紗廠購大量印棉　鑒於國內現有之勞工狀况、決在中國製造日方大部份布匹、日本紗廠主依照是項政策、近數月內已用在滬獲得之外滙購買原棉、增加存底、此乃調奄本埠金融與商品市塲而得悉者、日本紗廠主於四五兩月訂購大量印棉、定六七兩月交貨、其中大多定在上海交貨、亦有若干、已運往日本、但無論運日與運滬、紗廠主償付貨價所必要之外滙、大多仰給於上海、</p>
<p>此後勢將解除合同　昨據可靠金融界聲稱　中英平準基金管理處不援助舊滙率一舉、已收遏止日本棉貨大量輸入上海之效、雖此種輸入、難望完全堵絕、但衆信必將因以大减矣、除非日方能在上海或他處獲得償付棉値之外滙、則彼等或將處於不得不解除若干合同之地位矣、</p>
<p>購棉定單值千萬鎊　記者昨以日方購棉事叩諸經紀人、彼等大多稱小知棉値、究達幾何、惟作各種估計、有度在　與在日之日本紗廠主所購之棉、定此後三個月內交貨者、共達二千五百萬鎊之鉅、是項數字、固不能認爲可靠、然確知日方購棉定單、已臻千萬鎊之多、</p>
<p>日方計劃付諸泡影　上海爲外匯之源、不啻日本之小金礦、至星期三日晨、香港之管理局停止援助市塲始　、日本紗廠主在國內不能獲得必要之外滙、乃覺本市爲一光明地點、不過外觀黯淡耳、日方以廉價之日元傾銷於本埠市塲、而在游歷者旅行者與投機者之間、覓得其銷路、其所收得之法幣、悉數易成外匯、此種外滙、多由日商用以償付入口貨、且聞有若干外滙轉入日軍之手、但其主要目的、乃在購原料、供給日本工業、今日方之購買巨額外滙、至少暫時已被遏止、一般人均承認金融狀况若仍似今日而不變化、則日方銀行仍能獲得若干外滙、其數殆不足應付此間日本工業家的擴張計劃所必要之入口原料矣、</p>
<p>上海人士少購外匯　昨日上海匯市、僅日方圖購外幣一事、爲其特點、中外商人與入口商於星期三日午後與前日爭先購買外匯後、咋已不作此企圖、結果昨晨匯價頗穩定、若干較小銀行猶有外滙於手者、按照較滙豐掛牌稍縮之匯率而出售之、美金百元、幾須法幣八百元之多、除日方以外、上海人士按此高價而購外幣者、殊少見也、</p>
<p>財部闡述外匯時局　路透社十日重慶電、財政部今日發表關於外滙局勢之文告、略謂中政府之已定政策、在維持適合國家經濟、而可為合法貿易的基礎之幣制、此種政策、不因平準基金委員會暫不援助滙市之行爲而稍變更、該委員會之行爲、當然爲政府所贊同、中國付款差額中之缺少平衡遂漸發現、近來輸入大增、多非必要、今匯率之調整、可相助糾正之、而產生更穩健之狀況云、</p>
<h3>英籍警務人員　不欲學習日語　工部局規定發給日語津貼　英員忙碌對此事均感淡漠</h3>
<p>大陸報云、工部局對於警務處英籍與其他外籍人員之學習日語者、供給現金、是項消息、係總巡捕房昨日（九日）晚發給公共租界內各捕房之通告所披露、通告僅稱、工部局已核准凡警務處外籍第一組之人員希望學習日語者、發給</p>
<p>現金津貼其數自二百五十元至五百兀、（上海幣）於外籍警務人員修畢初高級課程時付給之、惟須經規定考試及格者、始有得津貼之資格、記者昨晚叩諸英籍警務人員數名、彼等將乘機獲此五百元乎、彼等</p>
<p>所答盡同據稱、彼等忙於應付目前上海之罪行局勢、無暇致力於學習日語、且五百元津貼、亦不足誘使彼等費時數閱月而學操日語、</p>

<p>棉花交易　祇賴同業點綴　大批印棉今晨祇埠</p>
<p>棉花生意仍以外棉據多數、本日成交二千〇五十件、同業買賣、依然熱鬧、廠方採辦絕少、市價昂漲、中國棉交易寥似晨星、貨物缺乏之故也、僅申新廠進一百二十件、係中國打包印、同行成交通花三百包、此棉身骨較優、售價亦貴、蘇北來源、到通州下沙花一百九十五包、又運往香港棉花計七十包、茲將現棉情形録左、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市　日較爲靜寂、開盤因棉區氣候報告不佳、棉花之害虫在密西西貝區殊甚活躍、南方現棉市塲亦稱堅定、華盛頓方面盛傳棉花出口津貼問題、將再供最近舉行議會中議決之、故同業均暫　觀望、結果近期跌一磅音、遠期略漲四五磅音、印度因上海滙兌猛縮、影響印棉輸往遠東殊甚、因市上交易淸淡、昨日連同預測跌三羅比、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>

<p>匯價平準之轉變　盛慕傑</p>
<p>自從三月上旬中英兩國成立一千萬鎊的法幣外滙平準基金之後，上海暗市的外滙英金終始站住八便士二五，美金始終站住一六元〇六二五底水準，直到六月六日爲止，上海外滙暗市差不多有整個的三個月底平靜，但從七月起，中英平準基金委員會自香港發電上海滙豐麥加利兩銀行，突然決定暫停對法幣出售一切外滙·外滙市塲固然爲一種驚恐的氣氛所籠罩，而其他各市塲亦受到極大的震動·爰就管見所及把這决平準政策突變的原因，和將來的動向，加以一番論述·：</p>
<p>中英外匯平準基金底成立</p>
<p>請到平準基金的成立，先要知道成立前的市況。去年的不必說，即以今年而言，自一月份起，滙市即從英金八便士半美金十六元半的行市趨向緊縮，不過供求雙方尙能適應；進入二月份則趨勢更緊，市上購方即佔優勢。自上海發生暗市之後，香港本居於售戶地位，向來被上海市塲上認爲暗市外滙的支持人，然今年售出的數　遠遜以前，而且供給的方式亦有了變更，往日不限價的，忽一變而有了範圍，市面上遂感覺到香港方面的支持力量不及以前的雄厚。市面上供求旣不能適應，滙價自然徐徐降落。二月十五日以後，滙市有急轉直下的趨勢，幸而滙豐銀行出而居於售戶地位，接八便士一二五供給外滙，市况方才穩定。試看一月七日至三月四日每週六的高低行市可知但是購者方面究竟是些什麽份子呢？</p>
<p>是商業方面的需要，就中棉麥兩方面的需要，數額允大。上海各紗廠因華北棉花被日本統制關係，紗廠乃退而購求印棉，其决麵粉廠亦有大宗小麥輸入，其結價概須用外滙支付，購入者乃頻向市塲搜括外滙。　天津方面因僞幣流通關係，僞組織有令三月十日起法幣不得在北方流通，保有法幣的，在此項「禁令」未實行以前預作佈置，希望避免將來的困難，紛將法幣易購外滙，自一月底即在市塲上活動，二月份的滙市幾乎全受北方的壓力，北方的買氣雖不猛烈，但市價稍勝於八便士一二五時，天津方面卽隨時活動吸收。　日商亦時常在市塲活動，但並不出面，大多委託擴客吸收。可知平準基金未成立前的暗市，旣屬購戶常多於售戶，那末以八便士一二五爲最低限價，維持的力量實在很促襟見肘的。中國政府爲鞏固法幣基礎起見，乃增撥英金一千萬鎊，以作維持法幣信用穩定外滙之　金。——關於滙兌基金參閱三月十一日申報拙作「中英匯兌基金借款一文。（未完）</p>
<h3>絲茶　浙繭出運遭阻礙　日繭價亦比往年貴　絲市有再漲之可能</h3>
<p>浙路繭市因繭行大部被毀、致成繭多行少之現象、乃促成繭價奇廉之事實　現該綫收繭業已蕆事、惟運輸問題迄未解決、被迫不能出運之乾繭計達一千餘萬兀、大部在游擊區中、小部在淪陷區中·僞方壓力尙未能直接控制、因是「華中」方面之威脅利誘、並無巨大效果、是以遂轉變策略遣派大小爪牙、分頭向絲廠繭行個別接洽、以遂共各個擊破之政策、然絲廠及繭商頗多深明大義、雅不欲有與「華中」合作收繭之嫌、咸拒絕其各半收買納捐通行限止專售於某行出口之條件、而若干軟膝份子、雖已出賣該種利益、但已受滬杭綫正規軍之膺懲、二日前杭市近郊湖墅等地繭廠被毀達十八處、燒去鮮繭三千餘擔、均屬警戒若輩意識模糊甘願合作之行動、故今後運繭或將以繞道浙東爲最妥穩矣矣、</p>
<p>今春日本育　量緊縮一成、本報前已誌及、然其收繭量之多寡、則因材料缺乏、尙未能加以估計、昨據橫濱電話消息、東洋繭市、本週正開始營業、鮮繭市價已自六十六日圓漲至七十日圓又半、按往年市價僅爲四十六日圓左右、而今春計高漲百分之五十四、藉此亦可推測東洋今年產繭量减縮之程度矣、又日本今年絲本亦高躍甚巨、現以繭價合算之、則白廠二〇——二二條紋、當在一一一四〇日圓綫上、一三——一五條紋、當在一三二〇日圓關、故絲市趨勢、在東市收繭結束之後、或將再轉上升云、（詳）</p>
<p>昨日本埠綠茶由協和怡和保昌錦隆等洋行、買進綠茶三百七十餘箱、提莊抽蕊珍眉、頂盤開出二百六十八元、普通珍眉、售盤自二百零五元至二百十二元、行情繼續堅漲三四元、</p>
<h3>五金　貨價都漲　銷路反滯</h3>
<p>近日五金品交易因外匯緊縮關係、故各貨開價飛黃騰達、然各路銷胃反見日蹙、故市况頓形呆滯、標準爲之高昂茲將六日行情及現市售盤列左、</p>
<h3>糖市　本綿白升半元</h3>
<p>昨糖市據倫敦電訊、近期微鬆二五、八月份爲六先令十辨士七五、十二月份則升二五、爲六先令一辨士二五、明年三月份升度相同、爲六先令一辨士七五、荷蘭電、七八月份原價荷質八·四五、續有收回二千包、香港電雖有小去五角、但仍在申市之上、故本市公會劃盤、依然堅挺、本綿白亦升五角、</p>

<h3>怎樣考試</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>考試是難關」，每一個學生，恐怕都有這樣的感覺，當他們在學期將終的時候。因爲考試不及格，就不能升級，或不得畢業，那是多麽可恥的事！</p>
<p>小朋友：你們學校裏，快要舉行考試了，你們覺得困難嗎？現在我把應付考試的方法，提出來和小朋友談談，也許可以帮助你們解除些困難。</p>
<p>考試是測騐你平時所學，究竟得到了多少？所以應付考試，完全要靠平時，不是　臨時抱佛脚所能奏功的。平時學到一種什麽，就學熟一種什麼，國語要熟讀，算術要熟練，常識要熟知；那末到了考試的時候，只要把學過的功課，重新溫習幾遍，就可應付了。</p>
<p>在考試之前，還要注意身心的健康，飲食起居，不失常態。因爲過分的用功，腦筋刺激太烈，神經倒覺疲倦，等到臨考的時候，記憶力旣要减弱，思想又會遲鈍，考試反而不利。所以「平時不用功，急來開夜車」，是千萬使不得的。</p>
<p>考試的時候，要態度鎭靜，不可心慌；着急了往往會「上塲昏」的，把預備好的一切，一時都忘記了。回答問題時，要看淸題目，最好先做容易的題目，後做難的題目。有疑惑不解的地方，要細細的想，不要性急，也不要留滯在一個題目上，把其餘的題目丟了。實在不知的空着勿做，切勿妄答，因爲是非，選擇等測騐題，不答的不計分數，答錯了倒要扣分數。做好之後，要細細地復看遍，當心題目遺漏或脫字。</p>
<p>小朋友！應該明白：求學是爲自己，考試是測量求學。所以你去應試，只要把會做的做，不會做的不做，切不可抄夾帶，偷看人家，那是卑鄙的行爲，自欺欺人的勾當，認淸了求學的目的的小朋友，是決不願意這樣幹的！</p>
<h3>小鷄的死</h3>
<p>— 庸</p>
<p>在三星期以前，覺兒眞是忙極了，因爲他家裏的老母鷄孵了十二個鷄蛋，他天天要去探望小鷄孵出了沒有？在三星期後的現在，十二個鷄蛋變成爲十二隻胖而小，黃而光滑的小鷄，眞是可愛極了。覺兒除了預備功課外，還耍當心它們的食物，恐怕他們嚥不下粗糙的東西，特地把米臼細了給他們吃，老母鷄亦咯咯的呌着，率領它的孩子們找小蟲吃。</p>
<p>小鷄在覺兒和母鷄撫育下，生長得很快，可是他們有了另一種不良的習慣，就是時常要溜出去玩，雖然母鷄急急的跑着，大聲的呌着，喚它的孩子們回來，可是仍不見一些踪影。比較膽小一些的小鷄，聽了母鷄屢决警告說：「孩子們，快些回來吧！兇惡的老鷹已在空中打旋，你們的小性命不能保全了！」於是飛奔的回來藏在母鷄的翼下，還有幾隻呢？直到吃飽了玩够了才肯回來。</p>
<p>終於在一天下午，覺兒發覺缺少了四隻小鷄，母鷄似乎異於平日的呌着，覺兒到處去找，在一堆叢草裏散着紛亂的毛，他拿起來仔細看，這正是小鷄淡黃色的軟綿綿的乳毛。唉！小鷄們終於不聽母鷄的話而死了。</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們是吾是一個聽話的好孩子呢？對於父母與敎師的敎訓，能不能照着行呢？我們的不聽話雖然不致於像小鷄那樣的喪失性命，可是正當夏天細菌繁殖的時候，例如家長和敎師都說外面的東西不能買來吃，你因一時的口饞，瞞着他們買了汚穢的東西吃，不幸而生病，那時的生命不是也很危險的嗎？所以我們要做一個好孩子，就要養成這聽話的好習慣，因爲家長和敎師的話不會使我們上當的。</p>
<h3>盤查</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>—明兒避難記之二十四—</p>
<p>用盡了千斤萬鈞之力，好容易的渡過了這樣急流險惡的閻王灘。那江山船似乎是筋疲力盡的在一個無名小鎭的岸邊，安靜地度過了一晚。到得天才拂曉，那船如恢復了元氣般，雄武的克服了它的難關，向前駛去。</p>
<p>明兒剛吃過了早飯，坐在船頭不妨礙船老大打篙的船板上，在陽光中取暖。</p>
<p>「在今天可以到那一個鎭？我們耍上岸去買一些菜，因爲今晚的菜要沒有了。」他一坐下來，便問那船老大。</p>
<p>「在今天一定可以到淳安縣」船老大一聽到他們要上岸，暗暗的有些討厭，因爲他們父要躭擱辰光，不過他們要上岸去買菜，只好回答他一聲。</p>
<p>「淳安那裏有菜買嗎？」他一聽到這「淳安」兩字，便覺得生疏，追想到以前在學校裏上地理課的時候，從沒有聽到這個名宇，可見得在書本上的智識是有限的。而一逢到什麼考試便有些頭痛，厭惡那功課的繁多，如今一想，這些功課是少得不可再少的了。他不再想下去。一聽得船老大還沒有答覆他弟二個最緊要的問題，便接着再問道一句話：一淳安是一個縣，想上去是比較要熱鬧些了。」「不！淳安，雖稱爲一個縣，而它却小得和鎭差不多，祗有一條長街，算爲它唯一的市面。而屯溪雖是一個鎭，但和它一比，眞是差得遠了。屯溪那裏眞好玩。」船老大如演說般的說了一陣子，仍是不合題，明兒聽得有些不耐煩了</p>
<p>「到底那裏有沒有菜？明兒大聲的回着。</p>
<p>「什麽地方？」船老大竟是這樣的糊塗。「淳安」「有的，不過到了下半天恐怕是沒有的。」船老大含糊的答着。明兒也不再問下來，走到艙裏去了。</p>
<p>在遠處浮起一縷縷的炊烟的時候，他們離開淳安的距離，憑着船老大的眼光可以望見了。可是在明兒的眼中却糢糢糊糊的，而又根本不知天南地北，因此更不知淳安在他的那一方，這當然他是不會望見的了。</p>
<p>江山船依舊如蛇行般一步一步的滑去，太陽也向天空的正中移動。</p>
<p>「淳安快到了。船老大似是而非的對明兒說着。</p>
<p>在船艙中的人們，正在一口一口的吃着飯，因爲他在中午到達了淳安後到岸上去，因此早一些吃了飯，總算可以了結了一件事。明兒坐在艙中的一角舖蓋上，滿口大嚼，吃得津津有味。</p>
<p>船頭上突然黑了一些，明兒眼見得四五個雄糾赳赳武裝兵士，穿着黃綠色的軍服，肩上架着槍，一柄雪亮的刺刀揷在槍尖上，胸前懸貼着一排子彈，在首的一個軍官，一根三角皮帶橫在胸上，黑黝黝的臉色，閃光的眼睛，炯炯的直射進船艙裏來。明兒嘴裏的一口飯，害得嚼都不敢嚼，迸住了氣，兩眼呆呆的瞧着他們。明兒的父親等早都站了起來。</p>
<p>「你們從那裹來的？此刻到那裏去？姓甚名誰？」那軍官打着國語的口音盤問着明兒父親，同時向艙中的四周打量了一會，又向船中每一個人注視了一下。</p>
<p>「我們從杭州逃難來的，現在想到屯溪去。我們這裏二家都是逃難人。」明兒父親帶着藍靑官話回着他的話，一面更拿出一張名片遞給了他。他看了一看不作聲。這樣的盤問了一下子，便走出了船鎗。明兒便隨着他們跟了出來。兩艘船橫在河的中央，船上站滿了兵士，那江山船恰在那兩船的中間靠着。而船上揷着兩面旗，到得那軍官們踏上了那船，給船老大做了做手勢，於是江山船才慢慢地離開了他們。</p>
<h3>救救孩子</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>自從舉行小學生畢業會考以來，各小學校的課程便加多，而上海的小學校爲允甚。它們不管小學生的身體和腦力，能不能勝任，只一味將各種課程，硬塞進小學生的頭腦中去，以致許多小朋友，都弄得面黃肌瘦，神思恍惚，看了眞呌人可憐。</p>
<p>有些小學生的家庭，總算是知識階級，放了學，還可以由家裏的人帮着溫溫，勉强應付過去，有些工商家庭，無人可以帮忙，他們除了平日在學校裏準備受先生責備，學期終了時，準備留級退班以外，就沒有別的辦法。</p>
<p>有些課程，當然是我們敎育當局所規定的，我們似乎不便反對。但是我們看了小學生在吃苦的事實，却不能不向我們的敎育當局呼籲，請他們速速再加考慮，另行重訂課程標準。至於一些變本加厲的學校當局，我們更希望他們在可能範圍中，多顧惜些小學生的健康。</p>
<p>現在每一個小學生，從一年級起，他的課程便比以前的小學生增加不少，我不柑信以前的小學生果然笨，或者長大了果然沒出息。那末現在何必多此一舉呢，有許多有錢的人家，看到了小學生的吃苦，就請敎師在家裹敎，實在也出於不得已，但那裏每一個小學生都能享受此福呢？</p>
<p>一二年級便要作文，三年級便要學習注音字母，陰平陽平，上去各聲，我眞有些奇怪。似乎小學生的學習能力，比了大學生（大畢的學生）還要大，因爲我知道，有許多大學生是始終不懂陰平陽平或上去入這一套的</p>
<p>順便說到注音字母。如果要敎小學生學拼音，爲什麽不用拉丁化的新文字呢？那不比注音字母更加便利麽？山大方塊字而變爲小方塊字，不過由百步而五十步，便利在何處！</p>
<p>現在暑假就要到了，我一閉目就可以看見許多天眞活潑的小朋友，都在垂頭喪氣，懨懨欲絕。我眞心痛！我要喊：救救孩子！（義賣默金）</p>
<h3>做一個小無綫電家（九）</h3>
<p>— 奚人</p>
<p>五，礦石機的裝置法</p>
<p>王民和他的堂哥二人很努力的工作，不一會兒就很快的把天綫地綫都裝起來了。王民看看屋頂面上新架起來的天綫，和窗沿下傳進來的地綫，他眞是說不出的快活。</p>
<p>「民弟你看好了」！正在想得出神的王民給他的堂哥這樣一喊，才如夢初醒般的，來不及的應道：「看什麽，看什麽？」</p>
<p>「諾」他的堂哥手裏拿着一隻雪茄烟的空盒，對王民說，「做礦石機，因爲機件少，又簡單，所以用不着好的鋁殻子（普通大的收音機的底盤，都是用鋁做的），我們只耍用這隻雪茄烟的空盒就可以做一隻好的礦石機。」</p>
<p>「雪茄烟的空盒也可以做無綫電收音機？我倒從來沒有看見過。一王民聽見他的堂哥說雪茄烟空盒裏也可以裝無綫電，他覺得很奇怪。</p>
<p>「是的，雪茄烟空盒裏也可以裝無線電，我一點也沒有說錯。倘使你不相信的話，你可以去問問旁的人，差不多剛學無綫電的時候，都楚用雪茄烟空盒開始的。因爲有兩個好處：　價錢便宜，普通在烟兌店裏買一個雪茄烟盒子還不到一二毛錢。　裝拆便當，因爲初學的人往往喜歡調新花樣，今天裝明天拆，倘使用了鋁質底座那是非常費事，但是雪茄烟盒是很便常的。」</p>
<p>「因為有了這兩個好處，所以人家都用它了。」王民聽他堂哥說完了，挿嘴着說。</p>
<p>「對了，人那一個不歡喜好處？好了，現在廢話少說，讓我們說正經吧。你看，天倒又快正午啦，又是吃飯的時候了。」</p>
<p>王民的堂哥說完了話，就拿起旁邊一隻把面蓋反頂過來了的盒子說道，「這一隻盒子的蓋我已把它反過來了（反過的方法見圖八），因爲在使用上比較的便當一些。」</p>
<p>「那麽，以前講的儲電器綫圈等都怎樣的裝上去呢？」王民聽他的堂哥說了一大篇，反而摸不着頭腦起來。</p>
<p>「慢慢的講，你不耍吵，讓我說給你聽。在這盒子的面蓋上要鑽一個大洞，和四個小洞，（它們的地位，見圖八的甲，）這個大洞是裝儲電器用的。四個小洞的用法是：左邊的兩個是接聽筒用的，右邊的兩個則是接天地綫用的。」</p>
<p>「哥哥，我叉有地方不懂了，你剛才說接聽筒和接天地線的，不知是怎樣的接法？」</p>
<p>「對啊！對啊！民弟到底不愧是聰敏的，我眞的是忘掉了吿訴你。原來這個地方還要買四隻接綫釘呢！這種釘我這裏倒有四隻，但是你還不明白它的模樣吧，讓我來拿給你看看吧。」他的堂哥說着，就到旁邊那堆東西裏去翻出四隻小東西來，對王民說，「就是這樣的（見圖八乙）。」</p>
<h3>博物院</h3>
<p>— 季權</p>
<p>小朋胡們！有閑的當兒，博物院確是好處所啊！那兒蘊藏着無限豐富的智識，那兒充滿着我們祖先的遺跡。對啊，博物院能供給我們廣博的常識，我們也應該去領略它供給我們的智識啊！</p>
<p>從前富麗堂皇的市中心區，有着一個博物館，它所收藏的材料，極爲豐富，但它隨着上海的砲聲，它被毀滅了—我們又失了一個智識豐富的好朋友了！</p>
<p>現在上海也有一個博物院，它是在博物院路，地址很淸靜，游人也很多。並且是不受門票任人參觀的，惠而不費的處所，眞應該多逛逛啊！</p>
<p>這個博物院，規模與上海市博物館當然不能相比，然而供給小朋友瀏覽，它的常識已綽然有餘了。它裏面有許多種類動物的標本和骨骼，例如鯨等骨骼它都具備，並且還有許多古錢，都足以啟發我們的智識。</p>
<p>今天又是星期日了。記得本刊曾經介紹諸位小朋友在今天去游玩好幾個處所，例如公園，文化街……等等，我也來湊湊熱鬧介紹諸位到博物院去玩玩，希望諸位的智識，也將像博物院那樣的廣博！</p>
<h3>畜生道中（五）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>彭其的父新，除了諾克斯旬。另有一頭狗，名呌勒夫，它是獵狗種，全身的毛，好像金屬綫一樣，耳和尾都是短短的。它的頭頸裏，圍着一條鍊子，當它彎着四條腿行走時，那鍊子也鏗鏗鏘鏘地響着。它的毛色是灰褐色的，不過胸前却是白色，脚尖也好似穿着淺色的羊毛襪子。它的眼睛，曾被貓兒抓傷，它那瘦瘦的身子，因爲常被虐待，幾乎佈滿了種種的傷痕。又爲了冬季老是關閉在潮濕的外舍中，連吠聲也帶着嘶啞了。可憐它常常過着惡劣的光陰，貓啊鼠啊，都要欺侮它，小主人又要虐待它，踢咧打咧，都是稀鬆平常的事。它爲了遭盡了磨折，所以它的脾氣也變得粗野了。</p>
<p>彭其雖是虐待它，然而對它倒也有些兒憐惜之心，看它終年的處於惡劣環境之下，身子一天瘦似一天，傷痕一天多似一天，毛色也一天灰似一天，然而它很能忍耐，甚麼都能逆來順受，因此引起了彭其的憐惜。至於諾克斯呢，彭其實在痛恨它，但因它是條大狗，很不容易欺侮它，所以一面懷恨，一面也有些見它害怕。</p>
<p>彭其除了虐待勒夫外，還要在它身上惡作劇，作爲消遣。有時還要把諾克斯開玩笑，他的花樣是層出不窮的。</p>
<p>諾克斯老了，很喜歡享些安樂，每逢它在外面勞動一番之後，就得飽餐一頓，餐後就得踅到一間和暖的房間中去，在那柔軟舒適的火爐毯上躺將下來。</p>
<p>要是這一天有什麼事情打攪了它的休息，或是有什麼使它着惱之外，它也會自言自語似的做出咕噥的聲音來。到了後來，咕噥聲漸漸地减少了，它那毛茸茸的眼皮也漸漸地合攏來了，最後使怪呌一聲，睡了過去。它那美麗而烏黑的身子，一動不動的躺在紅色的羊皮毯子上，黑色和紅色相映分外的美觀。不多一會，它已進了夢鄉去了。這時它又得發出一些低微的吠聲和嗚咽之聲，四條腿不住的抽動。它在夢中也許仍在河邊幹那搭救的工作，所以才有這樣的表現。但是它的主人要是吹一聲口哨，那麽立刻會打破它的夢，它就霍地跳起來了。</p>
<p>要是四下裏很安靜的話，它就一逕安睡下去，背心貼着地，頭頸和四條腿都仲得直直的，睡得十分舒服。，於是彭共就趁着這機會來捉弄它了。它靠近了諾克斯坐着，把一隻細針輕輕地刺它的嘴脣。諾克期一半兒已醒過來了，搖了搖它的頭，很厭惡似的把脚掌摩擦它的嘴脣，但是不多一會，它依然睡熟了。</p>
<p>彭其瞧它一睡熟之後，忙又開始來捉弄它，因爲這些虐待式的玩意，是他生平所最愛好的。末後他用一用力，猛力的對嘴脣上刺了一下；諾克斯推了痛，立時驚醒而跳將起來。那針深深的刺在它的嘴脣裏，便斷下了一截，終於被那兩位小妹妹發見了。</p>
<p>俘們見愛狗吃了苦，便嚶嚶地哭起來。平日間伊們是不怕諾克斯的，它有時雖張開了嘴，露出雪白的牙歲來，假做要咬伊們的小手，可是輕輕的，輕輕的，那牙齒簡直好像雞蛋殼一樣，使伊們一些兒不覺得什麼。這時兩姊妹中一個胆大些的，便捧住了它的嘴脣，好容易把那斷針拔了出來。諾克斯靜坐在那裏，低低地呻吟着，一而微微搖着它的尾巴；到得手術完畢之後，它便把兩姊妹撲倒在地，不住的舐伊們的臉，表示它心中的感激。</p>

<h3>畫廊裏的光輝</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>—關於禾子的木刻—</p>
<p>終天陶醉在藝術宮裏的青年們，在追求着綫的諧調，色的　律，純然的享樂於雰圍裏，追求着趣味和筆致，好像是忘記了祖國，只是追求着唯美主義藝術的修練？</p>
<p>事實畢竟出於意料的，一個明朗的早晨，陽光從太空中照耀到大地上來，灰黯的畫廊裏，突然現出了刺目的黑白對照的色彩，把路過的人的眼睛都吸引住了。原來，那兒是展覧着禾子的木刻。</p>
<p>講到木刻，在現階段的中國，正是需的藝術，因為只要一塊木板，幾把小刀，就可把現實描刻出來，於是可激發大衆，指示大衆。木刻，不偈超現實主義繪畫的神秘，仙風道骨的國畫　渺，而是一種力，一個號角，一位時代的領導者！</p>
<p>禾子，她現在還是一個美術學徒。平時一親也畫着裸女，風景，靜物的汕畫，水彩和緊描習作。照理，她只有一些所謂純粹藝術品給人家欣賞，做「閒」的勾當。但，事實適得其反，確是一位具有前進意識的女青年木刻者，一個站在前衛的戰鬥的夥伴。</p>
<p>她的作品的特長，第一是素描功夫的深刻，這或許是一般木刻者容易忽視的。好像，木刻的好壞，是題材的問題，然而沒有素描基礎的作品，表現力是不夠充分的，僅僅是題材的優越，只好算一幅　圖，因為沒有洗練的技巧，不能激起觀者的情緒，終於是不能算藝術的。</p>
<p>禾子的木刻，現在已向着外來風格的吸收。本來，一位藝術家的成功，風格的接受與影響，是必經的階段，所以她的作品，很多是從比利時木刻畫家麦绥萊勒（Masereel）的研究中得來的，不論在構圖上，刀法上，都有這一種現象，如「孩子，不要忘了江邊的家鄉」！假使能多作一點俄國木刻家法復爾基（V.Favorsky）克拉甫兼珂（A.Kravcyhenko）等的研究，更可以在表現上獲得深化。</p>
<p>近來她正刻製十二幅運續的「時代的女兒」，意國是指示大時代裏的婦女，不應該做家庭中的賢妻良母，應該為着民族，國家而努力。</p>
<p>最後，我覺得，藝術家的生活經騐的擴張，是非常重要的。　之，　禾子是一個有希望的青年藝術家，應該脫　這　　狹窄的孤島環境而進入於活躍的生活中去。</p>
<p>（附圖即「時代的女兒」之一）</p>
<h3>關於却爾斯勞頓　看「孤島異人」後感</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>却爾斯勞頓　受觀衆擁戴，應該是演技的勝利的最好明證，不然，像這樣旣非絕色女郎，又非風　小生的却爾斯勞頓，是應該為觀衆所冷淡的。可是他的受觀衆擁戴，却並非　倖而来，更不是毫无憑證的由於所謂天才，他的成功由於刻苦和努力，即使現在，他還是這親樣。他對於他所扮演的脚色的忠實，因之，為了揣摩他所扮演的人物的心理組織，就往往通宵不眠，據R.R.Williamson在却爾斯勞頓的藝術」中所舉的例子說，『當勞頓在　on　The　Spot一劇中預備扮演的督尼比勒利一角的原人－那個芝加歌的　兵，已經離開美國，而退居在意大利，勞頓便到意大利去，　着了他，这个主要的罪还毫不覺察，便在他自己的環境內研究他了。這便是他要獲得絕對忠實的劇中人物的性格的一個艱苦的例子。』</p>
<p>像這種例子是很多的，例如他為了體騐「畫聖情癡」中郎勃倫脫在當時的球境中所感受到那種感應，他便特地到荷蘭的亞姆斯脫頓去，在那裏　住了幾個星期等等，而當他決定了這個脚色的性格之後，他便很難改變他的主張，例如在「羅宮春色」中，為了呢羅皇的性格問題，他便險險呼和西席地密爾閙僵，像這樣忠於他的脚色的人，他的演技的成功乃至永遠不息的進步，乃是必然的。威　姆生的說他「他似乎無論扮演什麼角色，沒有力所不逮的」，實際上就也不是一句純粹的稱讚他的褒詞，這裏　，並且是包含了他的成因和過程的。有一分勞力才有一分收獲，好萊塢的多少紅星新陳代謝了，而勞頓却還卓然地站住在這激流中，並且，在這激流的冲蕩中，越顯得他的偉大和堅不可摧！</p>
<p>「孤島異人」中的琴逑梯德是他新的成功人物（這是他自已的「　查花」公司的第一部出品）看到這個人物立刻使我們連想到蔡楚生的「王老五」和魯迅的「阿Ｑ」，固然，在毛漢婿的筆下，（在銀幕上和我們所見的「怒船」，是經過考馬克的改編的）他不會是王老五或阿Q的複製，然而他們三個却可以算得是異族兄弟。王老五和阿Q是時代的悲劇中的大無輔人物，琴逑梯德則托庇不是中國人，所以他是眞的「大團圓」的。也許這又是太機械的看法，這三個人物的誕生是由於作者的意識形態的不同。呆是即是這樣說，不也是琴逑梯德的托庇不是中國人嗎？——而歷之，這個頑强的放浪的琴逑，就终於被感化而过他的　房之樂了。</p>
<p>也許是我為勞頓的精緻深湛的演技征服了（作為一個批評家，是不但能較一般觀衆以上接受和瞭解，並且是更該以他細微精到的觀察剖解和分析的。從這上面，就可以證明我不是一個批評家—當然史套不上「權威」的名字—因為我不能。），看完了「孤饑異人」出來，我的腦了裏就整個的給勞頓的影子所佔據起來，分析的能力旣告消息，然則就關於演技，我應該怎樣的來說明我的感受呢？</p>
<p>好許多外國報紙的批評都頌揚勞頓和他的夫人蘭吉絲泰在這個戲裏對二個性格的深動的刻劃，這是我所同意，但更使我驚服的是他把細緻的動作的堆　，由於這些細緻的動作，才把琴逑梯德的那種頑强，放浪的性格活生生地表现了出来，而且，从这上面，你简直寻不出他在「　怨」中的爱德華巴勒和「叛艦喋血記」中的勃　的影子。——總之，它就使我們忘不了他對脚色的忠實。</p>
<p>導演者可以稱揚的塲而是在那孤島上的一夜，琴逑抱着瓊斯登岸以及從饑上抱着她返船是很好的對照，瓊斯在島上的「一夜未合睫」，刖那驚惶的强目鎭定的斷續歌聲，更是他的聰明。是的，這一方面還得稱揚蘭吉絲泰，他的臉部並不漂亮，然而她的演技却是漂亮到極頂的。</p>
<p>電影的浪潮中變幻正是太快了，而勞頓却以他刻苦的努力卓然地挺立着。</p>

<p>日說趙樂天當時守護着机关槍，不想被對方一個手溜彈，自己的脚上却受子傷。　手溜弹的人，也只不过是盲目的一擲，但那彈片飛散開來，有許多碎片，都嵌進　樂天的腿中去了，本來他的那架機關槍，原是要移動的，至此只見他向前一仆，不能再站立起來。旁邊一位助手，便問：「隊長，怎麼樣」？趙樂天道：「不好！怕的我腿上掛了彩了，你愉保護好了機關槍要緊，別被他們搶了去」。這時在黑暗中，又瞧不出自己受傷到怎麼程充。只用手一摸，掷腿上濕漉漉的，向鼻子上一嗅，儘是些血腥氣。始而不覺得什麼，後來漸漸的痛得眼睛前發黑了。那時一面守護機關槍，一面便有人來背負着趙　天，黑夜之中，暂时借乡村人家安　一下。这一次，我军是勝利了，刦奪得對方的輜重車十三輛，輕機關槍三挺，步槍數十枝。他們的死傷，也比我們多了三倍，可是我們的隊長是受傷了。趙樂在因為自己勝利，忘却了脚上的創傷，所有炸彈碎片，一時未曾　出。又因為隊中的醫樂救護，設　不甚完備。自己又不免太大意一點，加着後方醫院又遠一點，幾個躭擱下來，腿上中了毒了，所以後來抬到醫院裏去的時候，傷勢已很沉重。在趙樂天倒不以為意，因想：我不是寫信給潘佩英，對她說：不久你就可以聽到趙樂天為國捐軀的消息。如今便是死了，那就是求仁而得仁，有何怨恨？但是後來到了醫院裏，經幾位醫師悉心診治以後，非　去腿，不能保全生命。因此之故，趙樂天便成了一足　了。所以那個時候，眞是趙樂天前天在火車中，和吳君素說的：父母俱沒了，又沒有讀過老婆，是一個光身漢，那時一無空碍。却不知道他，其中還有一段戀受史在內。當時還有他的一位朋友說：趙樂天這樣勇於作戰，奮不顧身，恐怕也是受了失戀的刺激吧？這話未免小　了趙樂天，那就因為趙樂天寫信給潘佩英，誓以捐軀報國，人家便把戀受與忠愛，并為一談。有時人家和他開玩笑，這樣的說說罷了。因為趙樂天是樂天主義者，也喜歡和朋友們開玩笑呀。（一三三）</p>
<h3>（一）這日到那日發出言語</h3>
<p>有一天，老態龍種昨日，中年今日，少年明日在一　談話，明日說：『你昨日是落伍者，你今日給人們現實的痛苦，惟我使人有希望和快樂。』老年昨日聽了乳臭未乾的明日誇口，大憤說：『我的閱　甚久，看到人心不古，世風口下。我紀錄了每個人犯罪的秘史，人無法不恭維我，若是你明日會給人虛空的希望，豈不知我老人可以把他們已往的劣跡宣佈出來，叫希望打得粉碎嗎？』昨日賣老，明日血氣方剛，三人談話，成為殭局，惟今日　襟而坐，作者茲代今日發表言語：『明日旣沒有到，不妨請他閉口！昨日旣定人們的罪案，須想法與他解決。因為人人旣了罪，自　與幸福，都剝削於昨日之手，昨日的罪若不清算，明日的結局必在囹圄！所以趁着還有今日，就信這一句解救的箴言：『罪的工價乃是死，惟有神的恩典，在基督耶穌裏乃是永生。』——上海基督敎文字佈這會郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>吳曉邦的舞踊新作</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>關於跳舞，普通我們所看到的只是跳舞廳裏所謂交際舞或是舞台上的歌舞，六日晚間竟能在寗波同鄕會看到吳曉邦的「詩歌短品舞踊新作」，眞是令人欣喜的事情。曉邦和他的學生們所跳的旣非交際舞，亦非大腿舞，而是有意義的舞踊。我看了以後有叫點感想：</p>
<p>第一是努力不懈　曉邦舞踊演出，此决是第五决了。這種再接冉厲的精神，建立舞踊藝術的熱誠是値得佩服的。但看他在熱天一連演七塲。換七决衣服，還要照顧前後台的道具燈光和鋼琴，累得滿頭大汗，就可以看出他的堅毅和耐苦。要不是他的學生們李世芳盛婕楊帆吳士雲呂吉間錯的演出，讓他稍得休息，他還不知道要多末的累呢。</p>
<p>第二是舞姿明朗　舞姿所含的意義大都容易明瞭，很是顯豁。曉邦有意創建巾國新歌劇，也採用皮黃和崑曲的精萃·因此，就我這外行的幻覺看來，頭髮上下的抖動不妨說是與　蜡廟老褚彪鬍子的抖動有相合的地方；拜佛者屁股的擺動，也不妨說是送親演禮巾的鄕下親家；盛婕所演的「心願也許是牡丹亭的遊園：這比擬是不倫的，但我當時的確曾引起了這些聯想。至於跳加官的抖袖，就是老票友，也不過如此吧？</p>
<p>第三是配譜適當　比方說，「收童」就配「農家的兒歌」的作者俄國毛索爾格斯基的曲子；「伴侶」就配「到戀人那裏去」的作者德國布拉姆斯：「惡夢」就配「吝嗇的騎士」的作者俄國刺克馬尼諾夫：「給玫瑰」就配「戀之歌」的作者美國馬克道厄爾。</p>
<p>第四是　義深刻　如「當時代中生長起來的人」走路沉重，行事極端，敢作敢爲雙手有力；雖無音樂，第一轉和第五轉連續的重踏聲連續起來，也有音樂性，彷彿蠻女在鼓上跳舞一樣。「自由人」助以輕快的進行曲，也極可喜。「徘徊」說明求佛與媚他都是無　的，只有反抗　是有效的。徘徊者終於死在魔手之下。最爲觀衆所歡迎的是「丑表功」，不曾出塲，台下光就給以熱烈的鼓掌。接着曉邦以類乎跳加官的姿態出現。這處理很是恰當，據說加官是馮道，那末曉邦是採用了本來的意義了。一會兒搖擺着，得意忘形，一會兒又作揖打恭，脅肩諂笑，活畫出新馮道的醜態，我欲爲之呌絕。</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>美總統羅斯福的夫人最近因Wntherlng　Height一片的公映，稱譽製片人桑高爾　（Samuel　Goldwyn）爲電影界具有魔力的一個賭豪·這部影片，故事是根據十九世紀英國女作家布倫端三姊妹中伊密爾布倫端（Emily　Bronte）所寫的文學作品。總統夫人最近在好萊塢看過這部影片的試映，所以「報紙上面My　Day一　內發表覜感·按羅斯福的長公</p>

<p>— 徐慕</p>
<p>余叔岩不願出演的最大原因</p>
<p>有許多人很懷疑叔岩的藝術必定較前退化啦，嗓昔也今不如昔啦，其實那全是多慮了。據我所知的，他不但比任何名角用功吊嗓都勤，並且他這位續娶的姚氏夫人，父女全是戲迷，他爲取得泰山及新夫人歡心起見，將來也要　機　作馮婦，使他們大過戲癮的。不過凡是眞眞的名角，決不肯草率出演，以致喪失他昔日的盛譽。姚老先生是北平的名醫，叔岩一面請他老岳盡心診治他以往的三種血症，（吐血，便血，痔瘡下血，）一面下死工夫再訓練出一位好琴師來，好免得　上出漏子。從前死鬼李佩卿，就是余三敎練出來的，以前如在桂芬，裘桂仙，時　實，這般名伶，全都拉得很好，叔岩，慶奎，寶森，多奎，諸人，也對於胡琴很有硏究。叔岩費了許多心血，才造就出來個李佩卿，不但襯托極嚴，而且琴音不剛不柔，和他的嗓昔完全翁台。叔岩自從佩卿故後，他如同失去膀臂一樣，從此就有謝絕歌臺的意思。後來經多少朋友竭力勸解，說你幾十年心血，學成這般能耐，耍是全行丟掉了，豈不可惜？所以他才把朱家夔我來，每天深夜裏到他家中吊嗓，這樣又訓練將近七八年啦，家夔才能把叔岩的性情摸淸楚，對於　派各種腔調，也心領神會已久，自然較前大有進步。叔岩剛覺得興致好些，頗有出演的意思，不料錢金福，王長林，道般老搭常又相繼物故，現存的祇有鮑吉祥一人了。錢寶森猶能繼承父業，玩意也很好，就是同叔岩配起戲來，也還不致與乃父相差甚遠。單單就是丑角太不易尋，長林之子福山，簡直不成玩意。富祿已經成名，若是敎他去就叔岩的範圍，他也不甚情願。　（三叫）子詹姆斯羅斯福不久之前，正加入桑高爾溫的組織，任顧主席之職。這决總統夫人的贊美桑高爾　，也許是同情於兒子的加入電影界吧？</p>
<p>夫人在觀感中是這樣的寫的：「影片的開始，的克希亞摩爾人一幕的景象，就有驚人的成功。雖然到這部影片的結末，並不是這樣。全片的故事，非常忠實，處理也很適當，而關於表現人類的情緒這一點，任何人不會忽略過。這就是原著小說成功的一大因素。觀衆在覜此片時怕難能不爲故事的緊張致失去自己的感覺的罷。最後的一點，戀愛在種種掙扎之中獲得最後成功，也是給我們每一個人所相信的。</p>
<p>製作這樣一部影片的人，眞楚一個具有魔力的賭豪哩！高爾溫對我說，將會有幾百萬觀眾看這部影片，因為這影片的本身有這種價值。無疑試映之前，「宴會席上，看見了梅兒奧白朗，她是一個美貌的女人，而高爾溫在電影界已經過相當的年代，他知道觀衆所要看的是那一類影片那幾個明星以及那幾個其他的藝術家。</p>
<p>由於總統夫人的為文頌揚，一般的人們，對於這部影片，　特別注意起來。現在這影片正在紐約和美國各大城市公映，不拘是電影批評家或普通的電影觀眾，都承認這部是有價值的作品，而想到總統夫人的目力不錯哩！</p>

<h3>溜冰術（二四）</h3>
<p>— 蓮君琦珍合編</p>
<p>一，外進</p>
<p>外進弧綫之開始，客腿須留於後，足趾向外向下，腿稍屈而不僵，客足趾在主足所劃圈綫之上，惟略向外，主膝須大屈，用客足之裏邊推進時，足跟處須較用力，身挺頭舉，臂則不宜舉得過高，身宜向圈之中心傾斜，主臀須在主肩之下，切弗外凸，外凸則不雅覜。客臀須向後，但不宜過後，庶免客足與弧錢平行。頭須側向主肩之一面，以上身之位置在第一式，及至圈綫過半數時，身須開始旋動，客肩客臀客腿本在後腿，須漸漸移前，主肩主臂稍移後，頭對正前面，此係身之位置第二式。第一圈將終時，客肩已到下决開步時之地位。</p>
<p>無論用何邊行動，除主足以外，四肢在中途，必須將位置改移，改移後身與主腿必稍挺直，且重心稍移至冰鞋之後部，改移前照行動方向，客腿必後隨，主腿必前導，改移後，則）客腿改爲前導。（注意：客腿後隨，並非必在主足跟後，因退後行時，客腿之後隨在主足趾之前，前導在主足跟之後。）身之位置改移，有一定之順序，即須由第一式至第二式，或自第三式至第四式。</p>
<p>每一步大的可分爲前後兩段，若前段身之位置在第一式，後段身之位置必用第二式，若前段用第三式，則後段必爲第四式。</p>
<p>身之於後半途，旋至第二式，不特爲下决開步時預留位置，抑且能助開步速力。</p>
<p>到第一圈終，客足即極速的移近中足，並向前一衝，如踢足球，然此係第二圈之開始，前之主腿，現改爲客腿。依第一圈之法，父回到中心，每足須依此法做三决即成。</p>
<p>客腿過主足時，有靠近亦有遠離主腿者，惟總以適乎其中爲佳，吾則寗稍近，母過遠，蓋過遠　不雅觀也。</p>
<p>身之旋動有（甲）自圈之初，即行開始者，及（乙）自圈之後半途，方始旋動者，但從乙者居多。</p>
<p>外進最易犯之通病，是圈綫過灣而失形，不成圈而成，其原因是身　得太過，主肩不在弧綫上，客腿栘前時，離主腿太遠，最好在鞋跟用力，身之位置在第二式時，須毫不移動，方可保兩圈相遇，而不致有失形之虞。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Southwestern Shanxi: Chinese Troops Firmly Defend Key Strongholds, Repeatedly Inflicting Heavy Blows, Japanese Attempts to Cross the River Extremely Difficult to Succeed, Large Chinese Forces Gather on the Opposite Bank of Jun Ferry, Awaiting in Battle Formation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Japanese troops are currently advancing towards three important Yellow River crossings in three directions. Fierce fighting is taking place in western Shanxi. The main force of the Japanese army is currently attacking Jun Ferry, apparently intending to cross the river and invade Shaanxi. However, well-informed Chinese military figures here expressed doubt as to whether the Japanese truly intend to advance on Xi'an, believing that the Japanese troops in Shanxi Province must remain stationed there due to the activities of the Chinese army in various parts of the province. The Japanese army would need to transfer a large force into Shanxi before they could attack Shaanxi Province. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yuanqu dispatch: The battle in southwestern Shanxi is still fierce. Up until the 9th, the fighting was raging near Liulin and Qikou. All key strongholds are in Chinese hands. Japanese casualties are greater than those of the Chinese army. In Fan-Pinglu, the Japanese army has been killed by the Chinese army in the past three days with four to five hundred men. Although the Japanese army is reinforcing Ji Fan everywhere, judging from the strength, their attempt will be extremely difficult to succeed (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to sources here today, the Japanese troops who advanced to Qikou, Jun Ferry, and Sanjiao in western Shanxi have been defeated by the Chinese army except for those at Jun Ferry. The Japanese side is now withdrawing troops from both Hebei and Henan to the Jun Ferry line in order to cross the river. However, on the opposite bank of Jun Ferry, (i.e., the Shaanxi side), the Chinese side has gathered a large army, awaiting in battle formation. The Japanese army's attempt to cross the river will definitely not succeed. According to reports, the Japanese army originally advanced westward from Lishi and Zhongyang in three directions. The central route led to Jun Ferry, the northern route to Qikou, and the southern route to Sanjiao. However, the Japanese troops on the northern route were intercepted by the Chinese regular army ten miles east of Qikou. After twenty-four hours of head-on attacks, the Japanese army suffered more than six hundred casualties, and their main force retreated towards Lishi, while the remaining troops retreated towards the southeast, hoping to join up with the central route. The Japanese army's offensive on the southern route has also failed. The Japanese troops on this route were repelled by the Chinese army twelve miles south of Liulin, and their main force retreated towards Zhongyang, while the remaining troops retreated towards the northeast, hoping to join up with the central route. The number of Japanese troops on the central route has now reached seven thousand. In southern Shanxi, Pinglu on the north bank of the Yellow River has fallen again after a fierce attack by eight thousand Japanese soldiers. However, Japanese casualties reached two thousand, showing the extent of their sacrifice. At the same time, the Chinese guerrillas have recaptured Maojin Ferry, five miles northeast of Pinglu. In this battle, four hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Yuanqu: After the Japanese army captured Pinglu, they continued eastward. On the 9th, some Japanese troops sneaked into Pannan Village (west of Maojin) and built fortifications, attempting to join forces with the Japanese troops who had sneaked south of Zhangdian to attack Maojin Ferry. A certain unit of the Chinese army intercepted them head-on and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. The two strongholds of Shengrenjian and Hanyao Village, directly north of Maojin, are still in Chinese hands. At noon on the 9th, two or three hundred Japanese soldiers from Dachen Village once invaded, but were repelled by the Chinese army. A certain unit of the Chinese army moved to the rear of the Japanese army, and thoroughly scoured the area of Xiaguocun, Nanbeilucun (east of Lingjiao Village). On the 10th, more than thirteen hundred Japanese soldiers were surrounded and routed by the Chinese army in Bu'ansao (near Lingjiao), killing many Japanese soldiers and capturing a large number of military supplies. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a report from Shanxi received here, the Japanese troops invading from Lishi have been blocked by the Chinese army and are at a standstill. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) On the morning of the 10th, the Chinese artillery in Shaanxi County fired more than a hundred shells across the river towards Pinglu, many of which landed in Japanese positions, causing heavy damage. The Japanese army counterattacked once from 4:00 to 6:00, with shells falling on Huixing Town and the banks of the Shaanxi Prefecture River, including many gas shells. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Military news: On the 4th, more than three hundred Japanese soldiers from Mancheng invaded Shimen and fought with the Chinese army for about two hours. Eventually, due to the disparity in numbers, Shimen was captured by the Japanese army. At 2:00 in the afternoon, the main force of the Chinese army arrived and launched a counterattack on the Japanese army. The Japanese army was unable to withstand it and fled towards Mancheng. In this battle, more than thirty Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. (Dispatch, 9th) Yu Ji On the afternoon of the 5th, the Japanese army invaded Liulin. On the morning of the 6th, a part of five or six hundred sneaked to Jun Ferry, confronting the Chinese army across the river. The main force of the Japanese army is concentrated in Liulin and is rushing to repair the highway, and will continue to sneak west. China has completed the encirclement of Liulin. (Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Retreating Towards Xinyang, Under Encirclement and Annihilation</h3>
<p>Xiangyang: Several hundred Japanese soldiers who fled from Xinyang and invaded Wujiadian, with four cannons, shelled Wujiadian village on the 4th. On the 5th, four or five hundred infantry and cavalry, with eight cannons, came from Xinyang to reinforce and fiercely attacked Fengjiadian. After an attack by the Chinese army, many were wounded or killed. The Japanese army was unable to withstand it and fled towards Xinyang. The rest have been surrounded and are being annihilated by the Chinese. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Recovers Liyang</h3>
<p>Tunxi: A certain unit of the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu launched a fierce attack on the county seat of Liyang at dawn on the 3rd. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted from the city. The Chinese plainclothes team in the city took the opportunity to respond, attacking from both inside and outside. The Japanese army immediately fled towards the west of the city and were ambushed by the Chinese army along the way, suffering heavy losses. The county seat was immediately recovered. In this battle, many Japanese supplies were captured. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Sanjiang and Muzhou, All Repelled</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) More than three hundred Japanese soldiers in Guangdong, using four shallow-water ships and more than twenty rubber boats, launched an attack from both the sea and land yesterday morning, shelling the Sanjiang and Muzhou areas. They then landed in the 8th and 16th districts, but were repelled by the Chinese local troops, with dozens of Japanese soldiers killed. Subsequently, Japanese warships attacked again, and the fighting was fierce. One Japanese warship was sunk by the Chinese side. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Public Opinion Supports the Arrest of Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the Supreme National Defense Council's decision to arrest Wang Jingwei in response to domestic and foreign demands, public opinion here is extremely welcoming, saying that it will enhance the determination to resist Japan. This measure has been generally expected since Jingwei left Chongqing, and has in fact been under consideration by the government at any time. Chongqing delayed issuing the order because it hoped that Wang could realize his mistakes and return to Chongqing. It was not until the news that Wang had decided to go to Tokyo for the second time on June 2 was confirmed that it was believed that he was incorrigible and had no choice but to issue an arrest warrant. Various newspapers pointed out that once Wang left Chongqing, his prestige plummeted, so his activities had no impact on the continued resistance of free China. It is believed that the government will also issue an arrest warrant for Zhou Fohai, who went to Japan. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Chaozhou and Shantou Defenses Consolidated</h3>
<p>Chao'an: A reporter from the Central News Agency recently traveled along the destroyed railway, on foot to a certain place to inspect Chaozhou and Shantou. Along the way, I witnessed women, children, the old and the weak evacuating from Shantou. Soldiers and civilians assisted in building fortifications, the situation was very busy. Everything was filled with a wartime atmosphere. After arriving in Chaozhou, I visited the military and political chiefs. I inquired about the defense forces of Chaozhou and Shantou. Commander □, with a firm tone, expressed his determination to defend Chaozhou and Shantou to the death, saying that the defensive arrangements had been completed, and the connection between the military and the people was very strong. The Japanese navy and air force's unusual movements in Linghai these days are a test of their attempt to invade. We have been very vigilant. If the Japanese come to invade, we will give them a head-on blow. (Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>American Ambassador Leaves Yunnan for Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The United States Ambassador to China, Johnson, and his entourage, Major McHer (Naval Counselor), came here by car today. They attended a banquet of the Diplomatic Association of Yunnan University in Kunming. It is also heard that French Ambassador Cosme is scheduled to go to Kunming from Haiphong on Wednesday, and will stay in Kunming for three or four days before coming to Chongqing. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Suspect in the Assassination of Cheng Xigeng: The Tianjin British Concession Decides to Extradite, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Orders Guo Taiqi to Lodge a Serious Protest with Britain</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) It has recently been rumored that the authorities of the British Concession in Tianjin, at the request of the Japanese side, have transferred Chinese citizens within the concession to the Japanese puppets, which has aroused much attention from all parties. The reporter inquired with the diplomatic authorities about the situation. It is said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the safety of the Chinese people in the British Concession in Tianjin, has repeatedly lodged solemn protests with the British side to properly safeguard them. It was previously reported that among the Chinese citizens detained in the concession, two will be transferred by the concession authorities to the Japanese side or puppet organization, and repeated representations have been made to the British Embassy, and Ambassador Guo has also been ordered to consult with the British government to seriously consider and order a halt. Recently, it was reported again that the British Concession authorities in Tianjin had received an ultimatum from the Japanese side, demanding that the four people deemed by the Japanese side to be related to the assassination of Cheng Xigeng be handed over within a time limit. The British government has decided to telegraph the concession authorities to extradite the aforementioned two people. Our side has again and again telegraphed the British Embassy to order Ambassador Guo to lodge a serious protest with the British government, explaining that our side attaches great importance to this matter and strongly requesting that the Japanese request be rejected. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Constantly Attacked by the Chinese Army, Most of the Japanese Troops in Qianjiang Retreat Outside the City, Chinese and Japanese Troops Face Each Other Across the River on the Hanyi Road Front, Intermittent Artillery Battles</h3>
<p>Fancheng: Due to the constant attacks by the Chinese army, most of the Japanese troops in Qianjiang have withdrawn outside the city and are deployed on the east bank of the Dongjing River. Civilian houses have been opened up by the Japanese army, and Chinese people are not allowed to enter. A small number of Japanese cavalry are active near Qianjiang from time to time. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Yichang) The war in central Hubei has gradually subsided. Currently, there are only artillery battles in the Luohan Temple and Qianjiang areas on the Hanyi Road front, with Chinese and Japanese troops facing each other across the river. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Xiushui: The Japanese troops in Wuning have increased slightly, and have been transferred from the Jinkou area. Chinese and Japanese troops are still facing each other in the Qian battlefield of Tupiyao Qiuchang, ten miles west of Wuning. From the 4th to the 9th, although the Japanese army continued to shell the Chinese side and sent small units to make probing disturbances, they were all repelled by the Chinese army. The line is currently very stable. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: After the Japanese army collapsed on the border between Henan and Hubei, the reporter went to the area to inspect. However, because all the highways were destroyed, and the civilian donkeys and horses were looted by the Japanese army, they went on foot, arriving only after two weeks. Wherever the Japanese iron hoof went, all suffered great disasters. The people in the border area of Henan and Hubei resolutely assisted the army in combat. The people brought their own dry food, destroyed highways, and transported bullets. What is most moving is that the people competed to adopt wounded soldiers. An old, lonely woman in Nanxiang, Xinyiye, whose arm was chopped off by the Japanese army, also insisted on adopting wounded soldiers. When asked, she said that it doesn't matter if I am injured in my hometown, but how can I not adopt soldiers who are injured in a foreign land for the country? Xu Buchen, the magistrate of Xinyiye County, personally led the self-defense team to resist when the Japanese army invaded, blocking the Japanese army's advance. Two days later, he finally enabled the Chinese army to arrive and eliminate the Japanese army. This is also commendable. The general public is able to thoroughly implement the national public, such as the people of Xinyiye not leading the way for the Japanese army, not finding food for the Japanese army, which is almost a universal phenomenon. After the Japanese army entered, it was like stepping into a jungle of thorns, unable to extricate themselves. The order in the recovered counties has been restored. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has ordered the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to allocate 10,000 yuan to relieve the disaster-stricken compatriots in Zaoyang. Other counties have also distributed stored grain and taken emergency relief measures, so the local situation is gradually improving. (Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>A Review of Shanghai Education at the Present Stage</h3>
<p>Education is definitely not an unimportant issue. The other day was just when schools were about to have summer vacation, that is, when the academic year was about to start anew. The education community must be planning adjustment and progress work. It is very necessary for us to review education issues at this time. However, the scope of education is very broad. The current review is limited to the various problems of Shanghai education at the present stage.</p>
<p>It has been almost two years since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, that is, it has been nineteen months since the fall of Shanghai. In these nineteen months, although the government's leading role has been temporarily difficult to feel, the national consciousness and national concepts of the citizens are still very strong. What is the Great Wall of will of these five million citizens built on? Undoubtedly, the uninterrupted education work is the most important foundation. Furthermore, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the invaders have spared no effort to destroy cultural institutions wherever they go; however, when they need to cover up the progress of the world's eyes, they do not hesitate to use various means to deceive young people and use the puppet organization to promote their so-called puppet education. When Shanghai first fell, the education community painstakingly maintained the education business, so that the general youth and children in Shanghai would not lose their studies, which was like lighting a torch in the dark world. When the traffic between the occupied areas and Shanghai gradually increased, people from various places flocked to Shanghai. The schools in Shanghai fully absorbed the youth and children who came to Shanghai, allowing them to escape the dangerous situation of being good people educated, and still received the national education of the Republic of China. Due to these two facts, it can be seen how painstakingly the Shanghai education community has supported and dealt with the precarious situation in the past nineteen months. Their hard work for the country and the nation is really impossible to obliterate. We should pay our respects and sympathy to them.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the Shanghai education community has not only revealed the phenomenon of painstaking support in fact, but also repeatedly unfolded a positive struggle posture in the midst of crisis and shock in spirit. In the spring of last year, the puppet organization attempted to seize Shanghai education without success; now it has aroused the coveting of the Jingwei faction. Originally, among Jingwei's party members, there were many people who had a source with the education community, so society repeatedly raised the rumor that the faction bought the education community, and said it with color and sound, as if it were true; however, until today, the rumor is still a rumor, and fortunately no such facts have been found in the Shanghai education community. Therefore, our understanding of the Shanghai education community is generally that they are able to distinguish right from wrong, are not threatened, keep to the right path, and are upright, and we also feel infinite admiration.</p>
<p>However, we do not have to deny that Shanghai education has not been very sound in the past two years. There is more than one unsound example, and there are two points in summary: one is that the development of quantity is too much to the fullness of quality; the second is that the phenomenon of messy disharmony covers up the spirit of cooperation and solidarity.</p>
<p>The so-called quantitative development is manifested in two aspects: one is the increase in the number of schools, and the other is the sharp increase in the number of students per school. This is a very common fact and does not need to be listed statistics to know. Quantitative development does have its own social reasons, and it is not a bad phenomenon in itself: however, if the fullness of quality cannot cooperate with it, it is the so-called deformed development. Let us try to review, the equipment of each school in Shanghai is now mostly very shabby, and at the same time the treatment of teachers is much worse than before the war, so the school content spirit is difficult to be full. Although it is said that many schools are currently burdened by rent, we know that there are also many schools that are not burdened by rent, but they have not paid attention to the fullness of quality. Even if they are really burdened by rent, they may not be able to save unnecessary consumption and plan for the basic fullness of school equipment and other aspects.</p>
<p>The so-called phenomenon of messy disharmony can be analyzed into the following aspects: First, the management of schools over students between schools and students is very lax, lacking active unified guidance, and students have good organizational motivations, but schools cannot actively lead; when students have bad tendencies, schools cannot make rational sanctions. Second, the atmosphere of infighting and mutual accusation among school faculty and staff has been repeatedly discovered; the facts of the windstorm caused by it have also been repeatedly heard. Third, the methods between schools are different from each other, the signs are different, and jealousy and attack are inevitable, especially when they are on vacation and recruit students, they are very obvious. Fourth, although schools have fulfilled the responsibility of guiding the national consciousness of the people in Shanghai, in fact, the leading role of schools in society is not enough. For example, schools have failed to play the function of the front line in the correction of bad customs, the unfolding of relief movements, and the implementation of spiritual mobilization. Fifth, schools have failed to fully comply with the national curriculum standards, and the tutor system has not been universally implemented, which shows that the Shanghai education community has not fully complied with the government's commandments and faithfully carried out the tasks of national education.</p>
<p>The two unhealthy points mentioned above are really the universal shortcomings of modern education, that is, capitalist education. However, in the past, there were government agencies to supervise and guide, so there were few opportunities for exposure; now, because the government has failed to obtain sufficient leadership, this shortcoming has been fully exposed. Education and politics originally have an inseparable relationship, so the crux of the shortcomings of Shanghai education at the present stage is still due to political reasons. However, we are now trying to develop the spirit of autonomy and national spirit of the Shanghai education community and even the citizens, and correct all the shortcomings. Even if the government does not have sufficient leadership in form, it will never reveal the state of anarchy in fact.</p>
<p>In October last year, the editorial of this newspaper pointed out that in order to correct the shortcomings of Shanghai education at present: first, the schools should organize joint institutions, and use the collective strength to act as the government's leading role; second, build a sound social public opinion, as an effective supervision and guidance. Although several months have passed now. We feel that these two methods should still be applied; however, at the beginning of this academic year. Each school should review itself individually, strive individually, and serve as the foundation of the joint organization.</p>
<p>To reiterate, although the Shanghai education community is currently showing that it is not threatened by power, not lured by profit, and does not succumb to evil forces: however, the other party's offensive will inevitably intensify in the future; the hardship of the work of the Shanghai education community will inevitably deepen. Therefore, now every school should self-examine, thoroughly implement the ideological purge and prevention work. In the past, every time the school was on vacation. Often, the meticulousness and scruples of personal details were taken as the standard for evaluating students' moral conduct, and the like or dislike of emotions was often taken as the standard for adjusting teachers' personnel. Now, however, attention should be paid to ideological tendencies, and the correctness of thought should be taken as the measure of advance and retreat. This can be said to be a necessary measure for the country and the nation. Please pay attention to the Shanghai education community.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Relations Becoming Increasingly Tense, Britain Drafting New Ultimatum to Refute Japanese Demands on Concessions, British Ambassador to Japan Visits Arita to Discuss Arrest of British Military Officer</h3>
<p>(London) The tense situation in Anglo-Japanese relations has recently become more serious, because the British government authorities are now drafting a new ultimatum to refute the Japanese side's demands on the concessions. It is heard that the ultimatum was prepared for drafting last week, but was delayed until recently in order to clarify the Japanese side's intentions. Generally, all its words are very certain and difficult to misunderstand, so in the future, if the Japanese side again infringes on the lives and property of British people, the British government will definitely retaliate. According to sources in the British Foreign Office, the British Consul General in Shanghai yesterday afternoon made a written protest against the "unreasonable" stabbing of British citizen Dinggler by the Japanese army, and reserved the right to demand compensation. It is understood that the reason why the British side is preparing to retaliate is due to: 1. The Japanese entry blocked the Chinese coast. 2. The Japanese side carried out anti-British activities in the occupied areas. 3. The Japanese side "restricted" the interests of British citizens in China. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan Craig visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning and talked for more than an hour. According to Japanese officials, there are two main topics of conversation: 1. The extradition of Chinese activists in the Tianjin Concession. 2. The case of British military officer Lieutenant Colonel Spears and Lieutenant Cooper being arrested in Zhangjiakou (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Government Currently Considering Continuing Loans to China, Loan Program Will Be Implemented Sooner If Incidents Similar to the Dinggler Case Occur Again</h3>
<p>(London) Sources in charge of Far Eastern affairs recently revealed that the British government is now considering continuing to provide credit loans to China so that it can purchase the military supplies it needs. It is noted that the UK has provided China with a credit loan of 500,000 pounds for the first time, but it has not yet been used up. Because British trucks are more expensive, the Chinese side has purchased American products with 250,000 pounds. Now that the quantity of British arms manufacturing has been increased and can be supplied to China, it will be possible to continue to provide credit loans to the country in the short term for the purchase of arms. However, if incidents similar to the Dinggler case in China and Shanghai continue to occur, the UK will also implement the loan sooner. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate in Tianjin Seeks Understanding from US, French, and Other Consulates, Will Act Freely in the British Concession, US and French Consuls Telegraph Reports to Their Countries</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The Japanese Consulate in Tianjin is currently seeking understanding from the French, American, German, and Italian consulates because Japan will start to act freely in the British Concession. The US and French consuls have telegraphed reports to their countries on the seriousness of the situation in Tianjin. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese authorities in Tianjin have decided to blockade the British and French concessions in Tianjin, but before implementing the blockade, the Japanese side will issue a statement explaining that Japan, for the sake of self-defense, needs to implement the blockade regardless of any difficulties. The Tianjin Japanese authorities have issued instructions to the Japanese expatriates, asking everyone to cooperate with the Japanese authorities in order to succeed in the new plan. The blockade order is likely to be implemented on the 14th or 15th of this month. At that time, all those entering the Chinese or Japanese concessions from the British and French concessions will be inspected uniformly, and Chinese and foreign expatriates will be treated equally. The reason why the blockade order must be delayed until then is that the cargo of the Japanese shipping companies and Osaka Shosen Company must be completely transferred by the 14th. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese sources said that the consuls general of France and the United States in Tianjin each telegraphed their governments yesterday afternoon, pointing out the serious situation in Tianjin and asking their governments to advise the British government to reconsider its attitude, because if the situation is not resolved, not only the British will be affected, but also the expatriates of other countries will be affected. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Tianjin news received by the Japanese newspaper, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin is seeking the understanding of the consuls of the United States, France, Germany, and Italy stationed in Tianjin for Japan's decision to adopt free actions against the British Concession in order to maintain the security of Tianjin. It is heard that the consuls of all countries sympathize and understand the Japanese side's position, and criticize the stubborn attitude of the British side. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The British and French concessions here heard that the Japanese would blockade them from June 14, so the British army has increased and patrolled the streets. Although the British consulate did not acknowledge the second ultimatum submitted by the Japanese side to transfer the murderers who assassinated the Tianjin Customs Supervisor, the Japanese intention to blockade the concession is extremely obvious. Employees in the puppet municipal government have now been ordered by the Japanese army to move out of the concession. At the same time, Japanese merchants operating in the concession are also transporting their goods out of the concession. The Yokohama Specie Bank today notified foreign banks that it would sever transactions with foreign banks on Monday next week. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank today notified foreign banks that it will withdraw its accounts with foreign banks starting next week. The notice is seen as another indication that the Japanese authorities are planning to blockade the British and French concessions in an attempt to force the British to accept the recent Japanese ultimatum demanding the imprisonment of the Chinese customs supervisor appointed by the Japanese who assassinated the Japanese. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul to Xiamen Travels from Taiwan to Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Consul to Xiamen, Uchida, arrived in Taipei yesterday and immediately departed for Tokyo to report to the authorities on the negotiations with the Kulangsu Municipal Council regarding the international settlement issue. Uchida repeatedly intimidated the people of third countries in China to isolate them. He stated that if Kulangsu were separated from Xiamen, Kulangsu would not be able to support itself. His criticism can be seen as Japan's plan to adopt intimidating behavior, similar to what was used against the British and French concessions in Tianjin. Because Japan is threatening to use force to manage Kulangsu, the Municipal Council there has yielded to two Japanese demands: to control terrorists and to cooperate with Japan in arresting terrorists in Kulangsu. Japan is still demanding the appointment of a Japanese person as the Chief of the Municipal Council and the appointment of a Japanese police chief. Uchida admitted that negotiations on Japan's other demands have been delayed, but he firmly believes that other negotiators "should wake up to the actual situation." According to reports, last month, the Marines of the United States, Britain, and France were sent ashore to prevent Japan from attempting to occupy the international settlement.

<h3>Japanese Planes Raided Chongqing Last Night, Few Casualties, Three Japanese Planes Shot Down by Anti-Aircraft Guns, Houses Hit by Bombs, Fire Did Not Spread</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Officials here said yesterday that a total of three Japanese bombers that raided Chongqing last night were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese planes attacked in two waves: the first wave with nine planes and the second wave with twelve planes, specifically bombing Chongqing. Another wave of six planes bombed the outskirts of Chongqing. One plane was shot down in the first wave and two in the second wave. As a result of last night's raid, only nine people were injured or killed throughout the city, it is said. Another report states that three people died and six were injured. (June 10, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Last night, during the Japanese air raid, some people outside the bomb shelters looked up to watch the aerial combat between Chinese and Japanese planes and witnessed two Japanese bombers catching fire and crashing. The casualties from last night's raid were relatively few because many residents had already evacuated, and those who remained in the city mostly took shelter in trenches after hearing the alarm. The authorities now plan to allow only 83,000 civilians and 27,000 military personnel to stay in the city, so Chongqing still needs to evacuate 110,000 people. Many roofs in the lower city were destroyed by bombs yesterday. This morning, it was raining, and staff inside had to hold umbrellas to work. The bombs dropped by Japanese planes last night were larger than those used before. A Reuters reporter inspected the lower city this morning and saw many large craters. The opera house near Reuters was completely destroyed by fire, and there was a huge crater in the road leading to the Reuters office, 15 feet deep and 25 feet in diameter. Another bomb fell in the busiest part of Chongqing's entertainment area and completely destroyed the facade of Chongqing's largest theater. A house 30 yards behind the main street was hit directly by a bomb, and everything within an 80-foot radius was destroyed. The ground was blasted into a hole, larger than elsewhere. A rickshaw shop was also hit by a bomb, and the street was littered with wheels. Many bombs fell in areas where the Chinese authorities are currently demolishing houses to create firebreaks. Although many water pipes were destroyed last night, the fire did not spread and was quickly extinguished because of this. The water, electricity, and telephone lines at the Chongqing United Daily News were temporarily disrupted, but the newspaper was still published as usual this morning because emergency repair teams worked overnight to repair the damaged parts of the utilities. (June 10, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chongqing was bombed again by Japanese planes last night. The first batch of nine Japanese planes arrived in Chongqing at 7 p.m., and eighteen more planes followed half an hour later, dropping many bombs in the suburbs, but the material damage was minimal. According to Chinese sources, 23 Japanese planes returned safely after dropping bombs, and four were shot down by Chinese air defense forces, it is said. (June 10, Huitong News Agency)</p>

<p>Danzig. Eight thousand Brownshirts from Danzig and East Prussia held a grand review here last night. Forster, the leader of the National Socialist Party branch, gave a speech last night, "The fate of the city of Danzig, which is being discussed by foreign countries, gives us the impression of the future of German cities. Since the German National Socialist Party has obtained political leadership in this independent German city, it deeply knows that the 100,000 Germans in Danzig are yearning to return to Germany, and this will definitely be fulfilled one day." Lutz, the chief of staff of the German Brownshirts, then took the stage and said, "The city of Danzig has its great National Socialist spirit, which is deeply believed by the Führer Hitler." At the same time, he sent a telegram to Führer Hitler, requesting the recovery of Danzig. (June 10, Huitong)</p>
<p>Warsaw. The Free City of Danzig is scheduled to hold a sports meet from today to the 13th. The German side has decided to send tens of thousands of stormtroopers to participate. Upon learning of this, the Polish government has reportedly decided to take various measures as a precaution. Political figures here believe that the aim of Germany's move is only to demonstrate to Poland and does not necessarily mean that the situation in Danzig is about to change. (June 9, Havas)</p>
<p>Danzig. According to reports here, Poland's attitude towards Danzig can be seen in two speeches: one was given by Polish cabinet member Kos-Głoskowski in Ciechocinek, emphasizing that Poland will not only fight to defend its current borders but will also seek complete victory and recover its lost territories. The other speech was given by a trade union leader, which included the statement "The next trade union meeting will be held in Danzig." (June 10, Huitong News Agency)</p>

<p>Prague. The German authorities have taken severe retaliation for the assassination of a German police officer in Kladno, an industrial center in northwestern Czech Republic. They have ordered all cinemas, theaters, schools, and public places to close, and ordered residents to close their doors and windows, shooting at those who are far away. In addition, Neurath, the German protector of Bohemia and Moravia, has ordered the Kladno area to pay a fine of 500,000 Czech crowns. According to the authorities, this fine should be paid by Jews and people known to support former Czech President Beneš, while the working class only needs to bear a small portion. Traffic is prohibited from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. the next morning. A wreath from Hitler was placed yesterday at the site of the police officer's murder. After the incident occurred on Thursday, the authorities immediately dismissed the mayor of Kladno, disarmed the Czech police, and prohibited people from gathering outdoors. (June 10, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The authorities in Bohemia and Moravia have offered a reward of 50,000 crowns for the capture of the murderer, and ordered residents of the city to be prohibited from going out from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. every day, except for those who can prove they have a job.

<h3>League of Nations Opium Committee Completes Discussion of Far East Drug Trafficking Problem, Points Out Various Criticisms of Japan, Compiles Report Materials</h3>
<p>Geneva. The League of Nations Advisory Committee on Opium has been discussing the situation of drug trafficking in the Far East for three weeks and is nearing its end. It commissioned Gavrilović, the representative of Yugoslavia, to draft a report. However, he insisted on refusing to include in the report the points raised by the Chinese representative Hu Shih-tse, who accused Japan of poisoning China in order to achieve political goals. The Chinese representative protested as a result. The Advisory Committee discussed this matter today for two hours and finally, with the support of the majority of national representatives, decided to comply with the Chinese representative's request and include the criticisms of Japan as materials for the report.

<h3>US-New Zealand Commercial Air Service to Begin on July 1, Stopping at Canton Island</h3>
<p>(Washington) The commercial air service between the United States and New Zealand, run by Pan American Airways, is likely to begin on July 1, as it is necessary to wait for the completion of the construction of the air station on Canton Island in the Pacific. According to the recent agreement between Britain and the United States, Canton Island can be jointly managed by the two countries for the next 50 years. It is reported that Britain had asked the United States last year for the convenience of stopping planes in Hawaii and other Pacific islands, but the United States has not yet agreed, fearing that if this precedent is set, Japan will follow suit with similar demands. As for the issue of sovereignty over Canton Island, it is unlikely to occur within these 50 years, but after 50 years, due to the advancement of aircraft navigation, the importance of this island may be greatly reduced, so the issue of sovereignty may not need to be disputed at all, it is not known.

<h3>Finland Pays US War Debt as Scheduled</h3>
<p>(Washington) Finland notified Secretary of State Hull yesterday that the war debt due on June 15 will be delivered to Washington as scheduled.

<h3>French Protectorate to Implement Consular Visa System for Imports of Japanese Goods in Late June</h3>
<p>The authorities of the port of Rabat in the French Moroccan Protectorate issued an order today stipulating that from the 20th of this month, all goods shipped from Japan must be accompanied by a special certificate signed by the commercial counselor of the French Embassy in Japan or a French consul, and countersigned by the Japanese authorities, before they can be allowed to be imported. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has strictly controlled exchange rates, and France's trade with Japan has changed from surplus to deficit. The French government has therefore implemented a consular visa system to remedy this situation. (June 9, Havas)</p>
<h3>US-Japanese Cargo Shipments to Europe, War Insurance Premiums Reduced</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The marine insurance premium for Japanese goods shipped to the Mediterranean has been reduced. It is reported that the insurance premium has been reduced from one yen per hundred yen to half a yen. At the same time, the marine insurance premium for goods shipped to Europe, the United States, and Africa has also been reduced. It is said that this is because the situation in Europe has become more stable. (June 10, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(New York) Major insurance companies here have followed London's lead and greatly reduced war insurance premiums. The new premiums are almost equal to those before the European crisis occurred, and the distinction between US flags and foreign flags has been abolished. (June 10, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Britain Implements Dual Policy to Eliminate European War, Willing to Resolve Disputes Through Negotiations, Building National Defense Continues Unabated</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech at a reception in Birmingham today, saying that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's speech in the House of Lords yesterday had made it clear that as long as there is a real hope of a solution, we are still prepared to discuss the demands of Germany or any other country at the round table. However, we must trust that such hope exists and that this solution must be reached through negotiations and not achieved by force. The Prime Minister continued that he believes the country has approved the policy he seeks to pursue, but to ensure the safety of the nation, he is pursuing two different but not conflicting approaches, namely, seeking to eliminate the possible causes of war on the one hand, and building Britain's strength on the other hand, so that when discussing the terms of a settlement, no country will take advantage of its weakness to force it to accept terms that are dishonorable or harmful to its major interests. Regarding the first part of this dual policy, he had to admit that he had encountered many disappointments and setbacks, and the assistance given by the countries he hoped to understand was very small. The other part, the building of national defense, has made great and rapid progress. He is now confident that no strong country would dare to lightly provoke a conflict with Britain. The Prime Minister's remarks were met with loud cheers from the entire audience. The Prime Minister continued, "The world knows that we will never use this great force to lightly provoke conflicts with others. Although there are often rumors of propaganda, reversing facts and confusing the public, I hope no one will be misled by these obviously distorted facts. However, there is one thing we must resist, and that is any step that attempts to disrupt the peace of Europe. If countries do not harbor such ambitions, there is no need to fear British force. Furthermore, the first part of our policy has not been abandoned, and I will continue to devote myself to stabilizing peace in the future. I hope to see this effort succeed in my lifetime." (June 9, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) According to diplomatic circles' observation last night, there is a possibility of a new crisis in Europe. Four British spokesmen, led by Prime Minister Chamberlain, warned Germany yesterday against new expansion of force and at the same time invited Chancellor Hitler to make a peaceful settlement of various outstanding issues. Foreign diplomatic circles speculate that the British government's release of a large number of declarations is due to repeated reports of an impending crisis in Central Europe. The British side remains silent on the new crisis and the moderation of German construction, and is focusing all its attention on the early signing of a military alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.

<h3>Germany Expresses Skepticism Towards British Diplomatic Statements, Refuses to Be a Defendant in Colonial Demands</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Official circles and the press here have expressed deep skepticism about the speeches made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax during yesterday's British parliamentary debate, saying that this speech was actually triggered by the frequent obstacles in British-American negotiations. Political figures declared that if Britain is willing to acknowledge the part that Germany occupies in the world, there is a clear way to express it, namely, to return the German colonies that were seized by the Treaty of Versailles. (June 9, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After British Foreign Secretary Halifax made a declaration in the British House of Lords the day before yesterday, Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech in Birmingham yesterday in response. The London Daily Mail commented that its intention was to invite Germany to participate in an international conference. The Berlin Stock Exchange Daily News retorted, "The Germany ruled by Führer Hitler is very different from the Germany of twenty years ago. It is astonishing that the gentlemen in London are still speaking to us in the tone of the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. Do they think that great figures such as Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini are willing to be defendants and allow those who call themselves democratic countries to organize a court to interrogate them?"

<p>Foreign Minister Bonnet Clarifies French Foreign Policy, Confident that the Three-Nation Agreement Will Be Achieved, French-Turkish Negotiations Nearing Completion, Willing to Maintain Good Neighborly Relations with Spain</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon to give a speech clarifying foreign policy. There are three main points: (1) Regarding the various difficulties in concluding a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, France is determined to make efforts to find a solution so that a satisfactory agreement can be established with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. (2) Regarding the two issues of Turkey's participation in the peace front in the Sanjak region, French-Turkish negotiations can be completed soon. (3) France has no intention of encircling Germany, and the current system of mutual assistance agreements only aims to ensure peace in Europe. The following is a summary of the speech:</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Bonnet first explained the progress of the three-nation talks, stating that France has never ignored the issues in Eastern Europe. The peace declaration issued by France and Germany on December 2 last year stated that France's relations with third countries would not be affected in any way. At that time, I declared to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop that this relationship referred to the 1921 French-Polish alliance and the 1935 French-Soviet mutual assistance treaty. Until April 13 of this year, the French government again suggested to the Soviet government to conclude a mutual assistance agreement based on the principle of absolute equality and reciprocity. Since then, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have conducted negotiations with a wider scope. However, due to the special status of certain related countries that should be taken into account, the current negotiations are not without difficulties, but the French government is determined to promote its resolution. In addition, Turkey is resolving various outstanding issues with the greatest sincerity, hoping that both sides can maintain good neighborly relations for a long time and cooperate sincerely in North Africa, Morocco. He concluded that at this moment, those who can accuse other countries of threatening each other with an encirclement policy, looking around all countries, are none other than France. In short, France does not use threats against any country, and is determined to respect the rights of all countries, and has no intention of dominating Europe. What it seeks is to maintain peace in Europe, which is the goal of the current mutual assistance system. (June 9, Havas)</p>

<h3>British Army Doubles in Strength, Implementing Conscription, Eager Response from Recruits</h3>
<p>(London) Secretary of War Hore-Belisha said in Plymouth today that Britain has become a great military power almost overnight. In these months, Britain will have more than 750,000 armed men, which is comparable to the total number of land armies in European countries. The doubling of the modern field army was announced in March of this year, and the response from recruits has been extremely enthusiastic. Only two months after the announcement, 152,000 officers and men had joined. It is unprecedented to achieve such results with any voluntary conscription system in peacetime. The current work of the War Office is unprecedentedly important. This year, the construction program alone requires an average cost of about one million pounds per week. (June 9, Reuters)</p>
<h3>France Deploys Ordinary Military Service, Demobilized Within Four Months</h3>

<h3>French Chief of Staff Hurries Back to Paris</h3>
<p>(London) The Chief of the French General Staff, General Gamelin, recently visited Britain and hurried back to Paris yesterday. The Yorkshire Post (the organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden) commented, "When the British and French allied forces fight on the French front in the future, General Gamelin will serve as the commander-in-chief, as expected by the public. This man is a great military strategist, the first person after the famous French General Foch. During the European War, he assisted Marshal Joffre's staff and was responsible for the opportunity. In the Battle of the Marne, the German army was ambushed and defeated, which was mostly due to General Gamelin's strategic planning. In short, after the war breaks out in the future, the military strength, military strategy, military orders, and various resources of Britain and France can be combined." (June 10, Havas)</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Induce Spain to Join the Axis, Germany Sends Personnel to Spain to Promote Economic Relations</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to reliable sources from the Fascist Party last night, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano plans to officially visit Madrid on June 21. The Fascist Party predicts that after Ciano meets with General Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Military Government, a political and military pact between Madrid, Rome, and Berlin will be signed, adding a third border to France for the Rome-Berlin Axis.

In addition, the dispatch of many German technicians to Spain to build factories and highways will also be studied. (June 10, Havas)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister of Romania's Inquiry: Conveying Southern Views to Turkish and Greek Capitals</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania – Foreign Minister Grigore Gafencu will depart tonight at 10 PM to visit Turkey and Greece. He is expected to return to Romania on the 19th or 20th of this month. According to political sources, "Following the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement between Turkey and the United Kingdom, the Yugoslav government believed it conflicted with the Balkan Entente and raised objections. Foreign Minister Gafencu's trip, in his capacity as chairman of the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Entente, will convey the views of the Southern countries to Turkey. However, this move by the Southern countries, instigated by Germany and Italy, is not something Romania can endorse. It is firmly believed that Greece and Turkey share Romania's view." To avoid internal divisions within the Balkan Entente, efforts should still be made to appease Yugoslavia. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Terrorist Incident in London: Bombings Repeatedly Occurring, Attributed to Irish Republicans</h3>
<p>(London) – Another incident has occurred in London, apparently in sympathy with the Irish Republican Army. While sorting mail at the North London Postal Headquarters, a postal worker detonated a package of letters, destroying several letters and parcels. Fortunately, no one was injured. At the Euston post office, while opening a mailbag, a fire was discovered inside. It was immediately extinguished. It was found that the fire was caused by a rubber bomb, but there was no major damage. A bomb explosion also occurred at the West Central district post office. Currently, police are monitoring all mailboxes and post offices in London, paying attention to envelopes with strange addresses. The police have been ordered to find and dismantle the organization of these terrorists and arrest those directing the violence. Therefore, many London police officers and detectives have had their weekend holidays canceled. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>South Regent Returns Home</h3>
<p>(Berlin) – Following Prince Paul's recent visit, rumors spread that Germany and Yugoslavia were planning to sign a treaty.

<h3>Sharp Decline in US-German Trade</h3>
<p>(Washington) – According to the Department of Commerce, trade between the United States and Germany has decreased significantly in recent months. In the first quarter of 1939, US exports to Germany totaled $18,017,000, a decrease of one-third compared to $25,578,000 in the same period last year. It is reported that the sharp decline in US-German trade is due to retaliatory actions taken by Germany, as the US, dissatisfied with Hitler's government, imposed a "retaliatory tax" of 25% on all German goods entering the United States.

<h3>British King and Queen Arrive in New York: Received with Enthusiastic Welcome, Boated and Conversed with Roosevelt, Visited Congress and Washington's Tomb</h3>
<p>(New York) – Amidst cheers of welcome from the masses, the British King and Queen left Washington at 11:45 PM last night by special train and arrived today in Red Bank, New Jersey. Upon disembarking, they were greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd. They then transferred to cars and were escorted by military police to Hancock Field, arriving at 9:35 AM. Cheers were heard all along the way. They then boarded the USS Warrington destroyer and headed towards New York. Upon boarding, the fort fired a 21-gun salute. Twenty naval escort ships accompanied them. There were also many yachts full of spectators, all displaying flags with words welcoming the British King. Seven thousand British expatriates also chartered ships to follow. At 11:10 AM, they arrived safely in New York. Governors Island fired a 22-gun salute in tribute. Fifteen minutes after landing, the King and Queen will travel by car directly to the World's Fair on Long Island for lunch. In the afternoon, they will visit the Canadian, Irish, and British pavilions. At 4:15 PM, they will leave the fairgrounds and head to Manhattan Island to visit Columbia University, and then to Hyde Park for a banquet with President and Mrs. Roosevelt. It is expected that at least two million people will welcome the British King and Queen upon their arrival in New York. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) – Today, Friday, President Roosevelt, as usual, met with reporters at the White House. According to his remarks, "King George VI and Queen Elizabeth are both amiable and approachable, and they have been deeply impressed by what they have seen since arriving in the United States." This afternoon, while boating with the King and Queen on the Potomac River, I engaged in private conversations regarding the international situation, but these were merely for the exchange of views. At the same time, the King and Queen met with British expatriates in the area at the British Embassy. Afterward, they drove to Congress, where the families of the members of Congress gathered on the lawn in front of the Capitol to cheer. The President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Vice President Garner, and the Speaker of the House, Bankhead, immediately led the King and Queen into the Capitol. All the members of Congress stood in two rows, applauding their welcome. The King and Queen, introduced by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Bankhead, shook hands with the members as a courtesy. They then traveled directly by car to the National Armory dock on the banks of the Potomac River. President and Mrs. Roosevelt were already waiting on a yacht. The yacht then cast off. In addition to several members of the US Cabinet, the British Ambassador, Lord Lothian, was also on board. The weather was clear today, and the climate was cooler than yesterday. After arriving at Mount Vernon, the King and Queen first laid a wreath at Washington's tomb and observed a moment of silence in tribute. They then visited Washington's former residence. The King and Queen toured each room and were very interested in the various memorabilia. The Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, US Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Woodring, and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, among others, accompanied them. They then went together to tour the garden (which was where Washington used to ride his horse 140 years ago). An elderly Scottish gardener presented the Queen with a bouquet of flowers. The King and Queen and the President and Mrs. Roosevelt then proceeded to Arlington National Cemetery to visit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the European War. They paused briefly at Fort Hunt, where unemployed people residing within the camp gave them an enthusiastic welcome. Upon arriving at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, they were greeted by General Craig, Chief of Staff of the Army, and a squad of soldiers presented arms in salute. The band played the national anthems of Britain and the United States. The King and Queen placed a wreath at the tomb and mourned for a long time. They then returned in several cars to the White House. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) – Today, the British King and Queen entered the Capitol here to meet with members of Congress. The cheers were deafening. 3,500 seats were arranged in front of the Capitol, all occupied by the wives of members of Congress and other female guests. The King and Queen did not enter the chambers but shook hands with senators and representatives individually in the central hall of the Capitol. The King and Queen first held a reception at the British Embassy, then drove to the Capitol. Cheers along the way were incessant. Senators gathered earlier at the Capitol, amusing themselves by mocking senators wearing formal morning dress. Then the King and Queen entered the domed hall. Senators and other members of Congress applauded for several minutes. Congressman Boylan escorted the King and Queen arm-in-arm past the senators and representatives. The King and Queen looked very happy, talking amiably with everyone. Soon, a delegation of members of Congress escorted the King and Queen down the steps of the Capitol. The King and Queen boarded a car and went to the Naval Shipyard, where they met President Roosevelt on the presidential yacht and took a trip to Mount Vernon. Senator Pittman, President Pro Tempore of the Senate, later said that the King had expressed his gratitude to Congress through the Queen. The Queen said, "We cannot express in words our gratitude for the universal friendship we have received." Mrs. Roosevelt, when meeting with reporters today, praised the Queen as a young monarch with a social heart who deeply understands the difficulties of many people's lives and work. Yesterday's garden party at the British Embassy was not open to the public. This morning, however, the embassy was open, and all British nationals, regardless of race or creed, could enter, gathering on the vast lawns to greet the King and Queen. There were black people from the West Indies, and veterans who had been reviewed by the King, as well as nurses, consuls, civilians, and children. A South African Sultan wearing a robe was overjoyed when he shook hands with the King. The weather today was still very hot. The King placed a wreath of white lilies on the marble tomb of George Washington at Mount Vernon. The Queen, President Roosevelt, and Mrs. Roosevelt watched from the side. This simple ceremony, seen by only a few, may be more symbolic of the friendly and peaceful ties between the two great English-speaking nations than any other event during the King and Queen's trip. One hundred and fifty years ago, George Washington drove out the redcoats of King George III. The headline of today's New York World-Telegram read, "Britain Retakes Washington." This phrase aptly summarizes the impression the general public in New York has of the success of the King and Queen's visit to the United States. The simplest fact is that the King and Queen are visiting America at a time when the American people are cherishing the whole concept of democracy, and America is treating them as ambassadors of a democratic nation. Pessimists initially thought that there would be many difficulties in the King and Queen's visit to the United States, but now all these fears have been dispelled. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>German News Agency Exerts All Efforts to Sow Discord</h3>
<p>(London) – The German News Agency's report on President Roosevelt's reception of the British King and Queen clearly makes every effort to sow discord and undermine relations. One report claimed, "When the King and Roosevelt greeted each other, Roosevelt forced a smile." It also said, "The King appeared tired due to the long journey, but the Americans still subjected him to extremely lengthy programs, causing him great trouble. The most inappropriate thing was that when hosting the King, Roosevelt even included the envoys of Czechoslovakia and Albania." Furthermore, the official German news agency DMB even claimed that Mrs. Roosevelt was a communist, stating, "After Mrs. Roosevelt described her plans for hosting the King and Queen at a Communist gathering in Washington, she even invited black singers to entertain the King and Queen at a White House banquet, to fulfill her communist spirit." It should be noted that Mrs. Roosevelt addressed the Labor Congress and never spoke to the Communist Party. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>US Film Processing Workers Demand Wage Increase and Strike, Affecting Newsreels of British King</h3>
<p>(New York) – After the newsreels of the King and Queen's arrival in Washington were completed, they were sent to the American Film Industries film processing company in New Jersey for developing and printing. However, the film processing workers at the company took this opportunity to announce a strike, demanding a wage increase. Therefore, if the strike at the company cannot be resolved immediately, cinemas in the United States will not be able to screen the newsreels of the King and Queen's arrival in Washington by the end of this week.

<h3>The Completion of the Yunnan-Burma Road: Over 960 Kilometers Long, Ministry of Communications Allocated Over Three Million in Funding, Local People Enthusiastically Provided Labor</h3>
<p>Kunming Airmail – The Yunnan-Burma Road has been open to traffic for several months. Recently, Yang Wenqing, a manager of the road bureau, traveled to Rangoon for business and took the opportunity to inspect the road. Upon his return, he reported on the road's current conditions: Since the start of the national resistance war, Yunnan has become an important rear base, and its position has become increasingly critical. The development of transportation between Yunnan and Burma, particularly the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Road, has become a necessity. Chairman Long, recognizing this, resolutely advanced the construction of the road, contacting the Ministry of Communications for joint management and ordering all counties along the route to start construction immediately and complete it within four months. The officials and people of the counties, deeply aware of the importance of rear transportation, understood the government's intentions and concentrated manpower and resources to work day and night. Within half a year, the earth road was largely completed and passable. Subsequently, the Road Bureau, in conjunction with the Yunnan-Burma Road Transportation Administration, made practical improvements, and it has now become the best road in Yunnan. Whether it is the rainy season or the dry season, regardless of the number of vehicles, it is passable without hindrance. The road line, engineering, management, and transportation are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Route</p>
<p>Starting from Kunming, passing through Anning, Lufeng, Guangtong, Chuxiong, Zhennan, Xiangyun, Midu, Fengyi, Xiaguan, Dali, Yangbi, Yongping, Xuelong, Baoshan, Longling, Luxi, to Wanting on the Yunnan-Burma border, the total length is over 960 kilometers. The average daily travel distance is 200 kilometers, so it is estimated that it will take five days to reach the border. However, due to station stops and other factors, it takes six days to reach Lashio in Burma.</p>
<p>Engineering</p>
<p>The Yunnan-Burma Road passes through many mountains, swift rivers, and large rivers. Bridge culverts and stone masonry make construction exceptionally difficult, so construction is quite laborious. The engineering process is divided into two sections: Kunming-Xiaguan and Xiaguan-Wanting. (A) The Kunming-Xiaguan section, from Kunming to Xiaguan, is over 410 kilometers long and was completed in 1935. However, due to financial difficulties, many bridge culverts along the route were built with wood, and the road surface was not paved below Lufeng. Once it rained, the road surface became muddy, and vehicles could not pass. Last year, in order to expedite the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Road, active measures were taken to improve it. All unpaved road surfaces, over 300 kilometers long, and wooden bridge culverts, over 100, were paved separately. The largest project in this section was from Lufeng to Yipinglang, over 20 kilometers long, mostly stone masonry, which cost more and took longer to build. It took two years to complete the road. (B) The Xiaguan-Wanting section, from Xiaguan to Wanting, is over 550 kilometers long. Construction began in December 1937, and the earth road and temporary bridges and culverts were largely completed and passable by May 1938. Subsequently, the road surface was continuously paved, and the roadbed and bridge culverts were repaired. For one year, tens of thousands of laborers were working on the road every day, which shows the magnitude of the project and the great effort involved. Among them, the stone masonry along the Cangjiang and Lujiang rivers and the bridges over the Cangjiang, Lujiang, and Bijiang rivers were the largest projects in this section, which cost more and took longer. They have now all been completed. All new bridges can carry more than ten tons. The reason why this new road could be completed in a short period of time is that the Ministry of Communications allocated 3.2 million yuan in national currency for bridge and stone masonry expenses, and that the people of each county enthusiastically shouldered the labor burden. From the start of construction to the completion date, each county contributed over 3 million laborers. These laborers provided their own food and came from 3-5 or 6-7 stations away. They worked hard and slept in the open at night. No matter how difficult, they worked tirelessly. This spirit of not counting hardships and sacrifices is truly admirable. The 170-kilometer section from Wanting to Lashio, which is within Burma, has long been completed and open to traffic, and active improvements are being made. It is generally good, but most of the road workers are Chinese laborers, who return to China in the summer. The road maintenance organization is not as complete as in Yunnan. If there is excessive rain, whether or not it will affect traffic is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Management</p>
<p>Building roads is certainly difficult, but managing roads is even more difficult. The most important aspects of management are road maintenance, tree planting, and operations. All these aspects cannot be done well without a lot of funds. The province's road funds are insufficient. During this wartime period, management equipment is difficult. Moreover, the Yunnan-Burma Road is crucial for military transport, so it seems necessary to coordinate management for the sake of unified transportation. The provincial government and the Ministry of Communications agreed that, during the war of resistance, the road would be temporarily taken over by the Ministry of Communications. In addition to compensating the province for the road construction loan of over 800,000 yuan in installments, the Yunnan-Burma Road Transportation Administration was established to handle road maintenance and transportation matters. All projects have now been transferred from the Road Bureau to the Administration. In addition to establishing two engineering offices and ten engineering sections to handle engineering, road maintenance teams, emergency teams, and technician teams are also set up in each section to repair the road at any time, and preparations are being made for a large number of road maintenance materials to meet emergency needs. With this arrangement, even if the road surface cannot be prevented from collapsing during the rainy season, maintenance is easy and will not cause major obstacles. As for the administrative organization, on the one hand, cars are purchased, and on the other hand, rubber-wheeled carts are prepared to supplement the lack of car transport. On the other hand, stations, gas stations, repair shops, hostels, etc. are set up in each county along the way. Once the equipment is ready, business will start, which will be more convenient for travelers and merchants.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>Transportation on the Yunnan-Burma Road is divided into military transport and commercial transport. Military transport is the responsibility of the Southwest Transport Office, and commercial transport is the responsibility of the Yunnan-Burma Road Transportation Administration. Vehicles from the Yunnan Automobile Company and the Automobile Business Office can also operate as before. Currently, an average of over one hundred vehicles travel back and forth every day, which is the general situation of transportation. In short, the Yunnan-Burma Road is currently the only international transportation route.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Harass Fishing Boats off Dachunshan Island, Wenling: Fishermen Afraid to Fish</h3>
<p>Wenling Correspondence – Dachunshan Island, a subordinate island of Wenling County's Dongxiang area, was originally a fishing area. The residents of the island all make a living by fishing. Now that the fishing season is here, yellow croaker and cuttlefish are extremely abundant. The fishermen all drive their own fishing boats, in groups, to fish together on the ocean. The proceeds can sustain them for half a year. However, two Japanese warships have recently appeared in the ocean, patrolling back and forth, with the aim of seizing fishing rights, freely invading and catching fish, and occasionally launching speedboats to chase fishing boats. Currently, the residents of the island, in order to avoid danger, no longer dare to fish on the ocean.</p>
<h3>Huang Bingzhong Killed in Nanxing Town, Changshu: Former Chief Detective of Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Changyinsha Correspondence – Huang Bingzhong (alias Huang Gang), a native of Sigang, Jiangyin, was 67 years old. He was formerly the chief of the detective team of the county government, with thousands of followers. He served in public office for nearly fifty years and had no enemies. When the situation changed a few years ago, Huang maintained his integrity and was not swayed by others. He often lived in the countryside or on the sandbars. The day before yesterday, he was suddenly shot dead with a Mauser pistol in a small teahouse in Nanxing Town (belonging to Changshu County). It is said that the reason for his death contained jealousy. However, after Huang's death, the security of several villages in Jiangyin, which relied on Huang for maintenance, will inevitably be affected to some extent.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Pinghu Self-Defense Corps Attacks Japanese Troops at Songyin: Over Twenty Japanese Troops Killed or Wounded, and Pseudo-Police Translators Captured Alive</h3>
<p>Jinshan Correspondence – On the morning of June 4th, Chen Jizhong, commander of the 5th Company under Shen Junsheng, commander of the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps of Jinshan and Pinghu counties, led forty soldiers, including Xia Xinzhai, Zhang Longsheng, and Zhu A'da, to attack the Japanese troops at Songyin. First, twelve daredevils disguised as farmers, hiding pistols, penetrated close to the Japanese garrison, waiting for an opportunity to rush in and capture Japanese soldiers alive. At the same time, they carried machine guns and hand grenades on the west side of the Zhangjing River, lurking two hundred meters away, providing flanking fire cover. Hearing gunfire in the street, knowing that the assault had begun, the company commander also led the team to rush to the highway bridge. Although there were sixty or seventy Japanese soldiers, they were caught off guard and hurriedly fought back, only using small mortars and not having time to use guns. Therefore, the Chinese troops were able to rush to the bridgehead and see over twenty Japanese soldiers dead or wounded, falling to the ground. The company commander then led the team to charge across the bridge, intending to capture all</p>
<h3>Gongshu, a Suburb of Hangzhou, Has Become a Scorched Earth: Chinese and Japanese Troops Engaged in Three Fierce Battles, Over a Thousand Japanese Troops Annihilated</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence – The Japanese army camp in the Hushui area of Hangzhou's suburbs was besieged by over two thousand soldiers of a certain Chinese division at about 10 PM on the 8th. The Japanese troops in that area stubbornly resisted, and the two sides engaged in fierce fighting. Subsequently, the Japanese army retreated in defeat, and the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue. When they reached the vicinity of Gongbu, they encountered Japanese reinforcements, so fierce fighting broke out again. The Chinese army, seeing that the Japanese side was strong, feigned a retreat, luring the Japanese army deep into the area. When they reached the place, the Chinese army surrounded the Japanese army with a surprise tactic and set fire to nearby Japanese army camps. The Japanese army repeatedly charged desperately, attempting to break the encirclement, but ultimately failed. As a result, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were annihilated. The next day, the highest military authorities of the Japanese army in Hangzhou mobilized a large army to advance towards the area north of the villa and Gongbu. The Chinese army used the trench warfare fortifications built by the Japanese to inflict heavy blows on the Japanese army. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army moved slightly back, and a big fire broke out in the area, destroying countless civilian houses. It is estimated that 31 houses were burned in Jiangzhang Bridge, 86 in Maiyu Bridge, over 100 in Zijing Street, 66 from No. 31 to No. 52 of Hongshibanqiao Straight Street and Heyan Lane, and also after Wulin Gate and Fenghuang Bridge, the area from the Gong pseudo-District Office to Fuhai Lane was also completely burned. Annihilation, the Japanese army fired machine guns densely, causing failure to fall short. Later, they heard the signal to withdraw from the street, and they safely returned to their original defenses. Their bravery in entering the street was commendable. The captured puppets included Xiao Tie Gui, the patrol chief Hu Fugen, and two Japanese soldiers' heads, and captured alive two Japanese translators, Qin Shaozeng, from Shaoxing, and two pseudo-policemen, Wang Kuicai, etc. Subsequent investigations revealed that over ten Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, seven or eight were injured, two heads were captured, and four were captured alive. It is said that Xiao Tie Gui's sister was intimate with a Japanese army leader, so the Japanese army put a wooden fake head on his headless body and put it in a coffin.</p>
<h3>日軍補充兵額　强拉華人當兵　迫充先鋒無一生還</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese army, entrenched in Jinghu, Sujia, Huhang, and the three railway lines, have only one or two thousand troops at most in each stronghold, and as few as thirty or forty. Japanese Army Commander Yamada Otozō telegraphed Tokyo for assistance, but as a result, very few reinforcements were sent to the Japanese troops on each line. It is now known that Yamada, in order to increase the strength of his garrison, ordered the Japanese troops in Su, Song, Chang, and Zhen areas to forcibly conscript local young men to supplement the army, thereby achieving the goal of "using Chinese to control Chinese." Therefore, the Japanese army in these areas is now directing the puppet county government agencies and the puppet Baojia chiefs to quickly send young men from door to door. According to the method, all those aged eighteen to forty-five are not exempt from military service. If they falsely report their age or evade and abscond on any excuse, they will be punished by military law. However, the eligible young men in various places have expressed their unwillingness to act as accomplices to the tiger. The Japanese authorities then secretly ordered the Japanese troops stationed in various places to forcibly pull Chinese people at any time, falsely pretending to be Japanese soldiers, and send them to the front lines to fight. It is now known that the Japanese troops in Jiashan and Fengjing set out a few days ago to Dongxiang to harass the Chinese army. First, they forcibly dragged more than one hundred Chinese people in the streets, tea shops, and other places, forced them to wear military uniforms, and used them as the vanguard of the Japanese army. When they arrived at a certain place, they were swept by the Chinese army with concentrated machine guns. As a result, the Chinese who were falsely acting as Japanese soldiers were completely sacrificed, and the Japanese troops in the rear saw this situation and fled in embarrassment. Also, the Japanese army in Xiashi rushed to the Ganhe Shang Theater one evening a few days ago and tied up all two hundred or so audience members. They were forced to change their clothes and set off at the headquarters, and no one has been seen alive to this day. It is said that Huzhou, Deqing, Pinghu, and other places also have similar incidents.</p>
<h3>運堤培修工程　測量隊出發　車新兩壩堵復完工</h3>
<p>Xinghua correspondence: Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Government considered the east and west dikes of the canal to be the guarantee for the counties in the lower reaches of the river to resist floods, from Erbao in Huai'an to Hehua Pond in Jiangdu, with a total length of 140 kilometers. There are many low, thin, damaged, and dangerous sections of the two dikes, which should be repaired as soon as possible to prevent flooding in the autumn. For example, there are more than 20 gate holes along the embankment section that allow water to escape, and more than 100 places where the bank of the dike near the river has collapsed, which should be repaired in time. It was estimated that the amount of money needed for the project was telegraphed to the central government for allocation. It is now known that the provincial government has based its decision on the canal engineering bureau's report. The surveying team for the project has been organized and personnel have been allocated, and it is planned to first engage in surveying work in order to plan the start of construction. The team is led by Xue Yiying, a technician from the Huaipi Section Office, as the captain of the first team, and Zhang Longchuan, a technician from the Jiangbao Section Office, as the captain of the second team. They set off to work separately on the 23rd and 25th of last month. Once the survey is completed, it will be telegraphed for review, and so on.</p>
<p>Also, news: The provincial government has based its decision on the reports from the Canal Engineering Bureau and the Gaoyou County Government that the damming and restoration project of Chexin and the repair project of the north and south Guotou dams were all completed on the 24th of last month.

<h3>中西運動會　西靑果獲冠軍　麗都第三華聯第四　麥令多麗都一分得亞軍　昨又創五項大會新記錄</h3>
<p>The open track and field meet sponsored by the Shanghai International Track and Field Association, where nine heroes from China and the West competed, continued yesterday afternoon at the American Boys' School sports field on Avenue Petain. As expected, the Western YMCA won the championship with 65 points, McLing ranked second with 37 points, Lido was a pity only one point behind, ranking third with 36 points, and Hualian and the Russian Army ranked fourth with 24 points each. Next were the School Union, Peide, and the French Army. Portugal did not score any points. Yesterday was a good day for track and field competitions, with bright sun and gentle breeze. The guests were more enthusiastic than last time. A total of eleven finals were held yesterday, and five new records were set, for a total of seven records set over the two days. Wu Bixian's 1.82 meters (5 feet 11 and 3/4 inches) was the best. Western YMCA's Fonseca and McLing's Finke were the heroes of yesterday, each winning two championships. In the environment and air of this isolated island, it is commendable that the Lido and Hualian teams of Chinese athletes achieved such results. After the competition, Chairman White LaTor thanked all parties, and the grand and enthusiastic China-West Games came to an end.</p>

<p>Finals shorthand</p>
<p>In the 100-yard dash, Edward, a strong player from the Western School Union, and Dai Shuguo from Hualian were absent due to illness, so only four people competed. Chen Yongfu had an excellent start, but after 80 yards, Fonseca from the Western YMCA came out and won first place. Chen Yongfu finished second by a chest. The result was a mediocre 10.4 seconds.</p>
<p>In the 220-yard dash, four people also started. Fonseca won easily in 22.8 seconds, which was one of the outstanding results of yesterday, breaking Edward's record of 23.5 seconds. Lido's Zeng Rongzhong and Liu Yongsen finished third and fourth. In the 440-yard dash, McLing's Finke took the lead after the start and had enough leg strength to rush to the finish line, leaving the second-place Milonov about 25 meters behind. No Chinese were selected. The result was 51.3 seconds, a new record, breaking his own record of 51.5 seconds.</p>
<p>In the high hurdles, Hualian's Li Zhenzhong started relatively late. At the 50-yard mark, the School Union's Hale was neck and neck in front. The competition was very fierce. Zhenzhong finally won the first place by one meter in 16.6 seconds. Lido's Wang Guozhen finished fourth.</p>
<p>In the 880-yard run, ten people started, and Chinese accounted for three. No one could compete with Finke. Lido's Guan Youwen and the Western YMCA's Yenas formed a group. Zhang Liang chased from behind. In the last 200 yards, Guan Youwen was finally surpassed by Yenas. As a result, Finke won first place in 2 minutes and 1 second, a new record. Yenas finished second, 20 yards behind. Guan and Zhang were selected for third and fourth place.</p>
<p>In the two-mile run, 14 people started. Guan Youwen and Wang Zhenglin took the lead, followed by the French Army's Fotia and Hualian's Liu Guangfa, who were difficult to distinguish. After one mile, Lido's Wang Zhenglin stood out, and Fotia gradually became unable to support himself. Liu Guangfa rose to second place after Wang. Fotia fell behind Guan. In the end, Wang Zhenglin dropped Liu by 40 yards, and Guan finished third.</p>
<p>The 880-yard relay was the final deciding event. If Lido won the championship, they could surpass McLing and win the runner-up. As expected, they were amazing. Zeng Rongzhong and Chen Yongfu took the lead in the first two legs, but unfortunately, the third leg was caught up by the Western YMCA's Dickson, and Liu Yongsen was defeated by Fonseca, which was a pity. As a result, Lido finished third in total points.</p>
<p>High Jump The high jump was one of the most successful events for Chinese athletes yesterday. Wu Bixian's championship was expected. The beauty of crossing the bar was met with thunderous applause. When the height was increased to 1.76 meters (5 feet 9 inches), only Wu Bixian, Li Zhenzhong, and McDolly remained. Lin Zuozhu and Zhu Jinyuan had been eliminated. At 1.80 meters (5 feet 11 inches), Wu Bixian jumped over it in one leap. Li and Mai were eliminated. When the height was increased to 1.82 meters (5 feet 11 and 3/4 inches), Bixian's bar was knocked down by his hand strap on the second jump, which was a pity for everyone. He finally jumped over it on the third jump. He was still .005 meters short of Zhou Shizhao's 1.825 meters at the International Games, breaking the previous conference record of 5 feet 10 inches by Polokokefu. Li Zhenzhong and McDolly jumped one more time to determine the third place.</p>
<p>High hurdles champion Li Zhenzhong</p>
<p>In the triple jump, Fonseca won the championship with 45 feet 1 and 7/8 inches (equivalent to 13.76 meters) on the third jump. Volorenkov also got 44 feet and 3/4 on the third jump. Zhang Jiakui got 43 feet 10 and 1/8 inches on the first jump, but he did not improve after that and got third place. The fourth place was Osler with 42 feet 4 inches.</p>
<p>In the discus throw, Ke Qing overwhelmed the crowd with 133 feet and 3/4 (43.09 meters), breaking the old Shanghai International record of 131 feet 10 inches held by Kaufman. The second place was Dickson with 128 feet 1 inch, the third place was Ross with 125 feet 6 inches, and the fourth place was McDolly with 120 feet 9 inches. All Chinese players were eliminated.</p>
<p>In the pole vault, the previous champion, Abramov, still won the first place with a score of 11 feet 3 inches. McDolly, although his score was the same as Abramov, had more errors and was ranked second. The remaining Shen Ji'en, Huang Guoxing, Huarkan, and Antson had the same scores. The ranking was determined by the number of errors. Shen was eliminated, and Huang and An got the third and fourth places.</p>

<h3>日軍助長反英行動　英再提書面抗議　英曾努力遏止反日宣傳　亦請日方注意反英文字</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great America Evening News" reported that the British Consul General Philip today (the 10th) sent a written note to the Japanese Consul General Miura, protesting that the Japanese army in the Pudong area hindered the Chinese workers hired by the British side, allowing them to be the Chinese workers of the Luen Chang Printing Factory, and promoted anti-British harassment. This confirms the oral protest issued on Thursday evening. In addition to requesting the containment of anti-British activities in Pudong, the note also cited the anti-British text published in the Japanese-controlled "Xin Shen Bao" on June 7th and requested attention. It also mentioned the efforts of the British authorities to contain anti-Japanese propaganda in Chinese newspapers of British merchants, and requested the Japanese side to also contain the anti-British text in the "Xin Shen Bao".</p>
<p>Plainclothes Japanese Prevent Resumption of Work</p>
<p>"Continental Daily" reported yesterday (9th) that the British Consulate authorities are preparing to submit another written protest to the Japanese Consul General within the next few days. This protest will confirm the oral representations made by Philip to Miura on Thursday morning. The representations submitted by Philip are related to the fact that the Japanese army in Pudong is promoting anti-British harassment. Philip stated that plainclothes armed Japanese on Thursday hindered the Chinese workers hired by the British Luen Chang Printing Factory in Bailianjing, Pudong, from returning to the factory to resume work, and requested the Japanese Consul General to take the necessary steps to prevent the Japanese from taking such actions.</p>
<p>The Tingler Case: Protest on Three Points</p>
<p>"North China Daily News" reported that the British Consulate authorities yesterday afternoon (9th) submitted a strongly worded protest to the Japanese authorities regarding the incident in which Tingler, a foreman at the Luen Chang Company textile factory, was stabbed with a spear by a Japanese sailor on Tuesday morning and died of serious injuries at the Public Hospital on Wednesday morning. It was stated that Tingler's stabbing with a spear was unnecessary, that the Japanese authorities did not provide sufficient medical treatment, and that the Japanese side refused to allow British personnel to see Tingler, who was seriously injured. It was learned yesterday that the English note mentioned the following three points: The stabbing of Tingler with a spear to death was unnecessary; the Japanese authorities did not make arrangements for sufficient medical treatment that could have saved his life; on the afternoon of June 6th, the Japanese authorities refused to allow the British Consulate authorities to meet with Tingler. The British side formally and verbally requested that a foreign doctor be sent, but the Japanese authorities first refused and only allowed it after a long time.</p>
<p>Japan Pays Attention to Anti-British</p>
<p>At a press conference hosted by the Japanese side yesterday, the spokesman of the Embassy stated that the British Consul General Philip visited the Japanese Consul General Miura on Thursday to protest the anti-British movement in Pudong under the control of the Japanese side and requested the cooperation of the Japanese side to contain it. When asked about the attitude of the Japanese side, the spokesman said that considerable attention would be paid to Philip's request. A reporter said that the Japanese side has armed soldiers in Pudong, so given the position of the Japanese side, if it wants to contain the anti-British demonstrations, it can do so. The spokesman replied that the Japanese side would pay considerable attention to the striking workers, but even the British authorities do not want to interfere in labor-management disputes. The current situation makes the situation very complicated. When asked whether the Japanese side would prevent anti-British conferences that only have political meaning and do not involve labor and management, the spokesman replied, "You are deliberately asking this question. If peace and order are maintained for a long time, the Japanese side may not interfere."</p>
<p>Tingler's Funeral Attracts Many Mourners</p>

Major Noji, the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps who stabbed Tingler on Tuesday, also went to the cemetery in plain black clothes. He bowed to the hearse as it passed by.</p>

<h3>Martial Law in Beixinjing - Reason for Martial Law - Japanese Troops Ambushed - Leading Unit Annihilated</h3>
<p>Martial law has been imposed in Beixinjing, northwest of Shanghai, and land and water transportation has been cut off. A few days ago, a Westerner who came from western Shanghai saw a large number of Japanese troops advancing rapidly westward. Soon after, he heard intense gunfire, knowing that they were clashing with guerrillas. The true situation has now been ascertained as follows: Since Zhao Jiayou, the company commander of the directly subordinate infantry company of the Shanghai People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps, and his deputy, Jiang Shihua, led their troops to garrison west of Beixinjing, northwest of Shanghai, it has been over a year. Zhao has worked hard to strengthen his forces, controlling towns such as Huacao and Zhuzhai. In the past year, he has clashed with the Japanese army no fewer than a dozen times, attracting the attention of the Japanese side, which has offered a reward for his capture. However, Zhao is elusive and attacks them from time to time. The Japanese army hates him to the core. On the 4th of this month, the Japanese troops garrisoning Beixinjing received a report that Zhao's company was using a certain place as a base and intended to attack. However, considering that the forces in Beixinjing were weak, they dispatched a large unit of over a hundred Japanese soldiers from the Lincoln Road headquarters, carrying light and heavy machine guns, small steel cannons, and other weapons, departing from Beixinjing at dawn and advancing rapidly westward in the hope of surrounding Huacao Town. Unexpectedly, Zhao's company had received intelligence in advance, and without making a sound, they first dispersed their troops. When the Japanese troops reached Taohong, their leading unit of over forty men had already passed through the village, and the rear unit was following closely. Suddenly, machine guns and rifles opened fire fiercely, with bullets raining down. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and hastily returned fire, but the front and rear units had been cut off by Zhao's company, resulting in poor coordination. Zhao's company was also familiar with the terrain and had a large number of men. The Japanese troops were at a disadvantage. The two sides fought fiercely for three hours. Many Japanese soldiers in the leading unit were killed, with few survivors. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the rear unit scurried back. By the time reinforcements arrived from Lincoln Road, they had already disappeared like a crane that had flown away. The Japanese army, having suffered a heavy blow, was frustrated and resentful, and vented their anger on the nearby civilians. All villages near Beixinjing were searched, but nothing was found. Meanwhile, martial law was temporarily imposed, cutting off land and water transportation. The intense gunfire heard by the Westerner was from this battle.</p>
<h3>Industries Related to Foreign Exchange - Consider Increasing Prices - Hardware Up 30%, Parts Up 20% - Paper, Kerosene, and Pigments Also Increase in Price</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange sales, various industries dealing in imported goods have successively increased their selling prices to maintain their capital. The Shanghai Hardware Industry Association specifically convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, with over fifty businesses attending, including Hengda Xiang, Xinshun Tai, Zheng Ji, Yongchang, Changchang, Xingheng, Jiutai, Shen Ji, etc. Zhang Lianfang was elected as chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, and then discussions were held. Everyone agreed that the industry's goods were closely related to foreign exchange fluctuations. Given the current selling price of exchange rates, prices should be increased uniformly by 30%. It was also agreed that goods such as pipes, copper, and iron were particularly sought after. However, if foreign exchange shrinks further, the prices of all major hardware goods will still need to increase, among other important matters. The Hardware Parts Industry Association also convened an evaluation committee meeting at its clubhouse in the Coal Industry Building on Tianjin Road at 2:00 PM yesterday, with all members attending. Chairman Wang Yuanzhang reported that the sudden shrinking of foreign exchange recently has increased the cost of hardware such as hinges and door locks that the industry's members had already ordered from Europe and the United States. In order to maintain the capital of the industry's members, selling prices must be increased immediately. After discussion, it was resolved that the prices of all kinds of hinges, metal door locks, etc., would be increased by 20% starting today. As for industries related to foreign exchange, such as paper, kerosene, and pigments, all have increased in price, so the cost of living for citizens is increasing again.</p>
<h3>Export of Goods Purchased with Foreign Exchange - Transit Taxes Exempted - Ministry of Finance Specifies Three Methods for Exemption to Facilitate Export of Domestic Products</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the export of goods purchased with foreign exchange, the National Government's Ministry of Finance has issued three methods for exempting transit taxes, ordering all customs offices to comply. At the same time, the Zhejiang Customs announced that cotton parcels transported from occupied areas to the interior must be notified to the local consolidated tax authorities to levy consolidated taxes. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Tax Exemption Methods for Exported Goods</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructs all customs offices: "The exemption of export taxes on goods transported abroad purchased with foreign exchange has been implemented since January 1st of this year. In order to facilitate the transit and export of goods purchased with foreign exchange, the following three methods for exempting transit taxes are specifically stipulated: 1. The merchant pays a full amount of deposit and is allowed to proceed. Within a one-year period, the deposit will be returned upon verification of the foreign exchange purchase certificate or cultivation and transportation permit. If the deadline is exceeded, the deposit will be credited to the customs account. 2. The merchant obtains a guarantee from any one of the four banks (Central, China, Communications, Agricultural) or another bank recognized by the customs and deposits it with the customs as a guarantee. If the tax is not paid within one year, the tax will be cleared. 3. When the merchant begins purchasing goods, they consult with the Trade Commission to determine the method of transshipment and storage. The Commission issues a certificate to the customs, listing the type and quantity of goods, the estimated value, and the name and address of the owner, guaranteeing that the goods will be exported within one year. If the goods are not exported after the deadline, the owner shall pay the transit tax according to regulations, or the Trade Commission shall be responsible for payment. Merchants are allowed to choose any of the above methods to proceed. These methods will be implemented from the date of receipt of the telegram. In addition to telegraphing the Director-General of Customs and the Trade Commission separately, a special telegram is sent for compliance and public announcement."</p>
<p>Consolidated Tax on Cotton Parcels</p>
<p>Announcement by the Superintendent and Commissioner of Customs of the Zhejiang Customs: "According to a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, in the future, cotton yarn, directly woven finished products, and processed manufactured goods transported from occupied areas to the interior must be notified by the customs office at the point of arrival to the local consolidated tax authorities to pay consolidated taxes to prevent leakage and maintain tax revenue. Upon receipt of this, we shall comply. In the future, even if the above parcels have completed the customs transit tax, they must still present a verified consolidated tax receipt before they can be released. This is hereby announced for public knowledge."</p>
<p>Refund of Transit Tax for Foreign Exchange Goods</p>
<p>For all merchants whose foreign exchange goods, which are categorized into thirteen types and for which transit taxes have been paid within the past year, are exported after New Year's Day of this year, or are currently being prepared for export, they must submit the original transit tax receipt for verification and registration within three months. After receiving notification that the goods have been shipped abroad, the original tax-collecting customs office will verify the registered transit tax receipt and the foreign exchange settlement documents or Type A transportation permit and verify and refund the original transit tax paid. However, this is limited to goods that are transshipped to the second port and then re-exported in their original packaging or repackaged in accordance with regulations within one year. Please comply accordingly.</p>
<p>Consolidated Tax on Cotton Parcels</p>
<p>In the future, cotton yarn, directly woven finished products, and processed manufactured goods transported from occupied areas to the interior must be notified by the customs office at the point of arrival to the local consolidated tax authorities to pay consolidated taxes to prevent leakage and maintain tax revenue.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Stabilizes - No Change in Major Exchange Rates - Excitement of the Past Few Days Disappears - Yesterday's Japanese Yen Rate Lower Than Legal Tender</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our newspaper in Chongqing on the 10th) A reporter, concerned about the recent fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, specifically inquired with the Ministry of Finance. The spokesperson of the Ministry responded as follows: 1. Maintaining legal tender is the established policy of the Chinese government. The methods used by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee for adjusting foreign exchange rates recently have neither changed the government's policy nor were they measures approved by the government. 2. Due to seasonal import and export relations, imports have increased recently, especially the import of non-essential goods. Therefore, adjusting foreign exchange rates to conform to standards that are beneficial to our economy and maintaining the balance of international payments can better consolidate the foreign exchange market. 3. The government's maintenance of the legal tender's legal exchange rate has never changed before or after the war. Since the management of foreign exchange began, the Central Bank has sold foreign exchange at the legal exchange rate to public and private institutions that have legitimate needs and have been approved by the Ministry of Finance. The facts are clear. As for the difference between the market price and the legal price, this phenomenon is not unique to our country since foreign exchange is being managed. 4. The government has repeatedly instructed banks to maintain stability in order to reduce market fluctuations, and the results have been quite good. Since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee, the management mechanism has become more complete, and its strength in maintaining stability is expected to increase. 5. The government is now working harder to reduce the import of non-essential goods and is taking various measures to encourage exports, while saving on the use of foreign exchange, in the hope of benefiting China's economy and adapting to the needs of the war. The strength of the Stabilization Fund Management Committee is also sufficient to stabilize the market. I am deeply confident that everyone's confidence in the legal tender will increase further and will not be affected by the current market fluctuations.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from our newspaper in Hong Kong on the 10th) The price of legal tender has stabilized. According to those in charge, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund has not felt any pressure in the past few weeks, and the credit of the national currency has not been shaken. This is generally acknowledged. However, the Stabilization Fund Committee temporarily stopped maintaining the exchange rate on Wednesday, allowing the foreign exchange price against the U.S. dollar to reach a better economic level so that foreign trade could be balanced. It is recalled that a similar approach was adopted in June 1938, and this price was maintained for twelve months without change until it reached a level of eight and one-quarter pence. It is believed that the new level has now been achieved and can be firmly maintained. Many items that were previously imported can now be manufactured domestically. According to reports, the expected bumper harvest this year will help to reduce imports. The method for the government to purchase foreign exchange needed for military supplies and other items has been decided and will not affect the foreign exchange market. Finally, the efforts to thoroughly expand the base of this fund have been successful. The government's strength in maintaining foreign exchange is undoubtedly not a problem. Although there is currently a change in the exchange rate level, the national currency continues to gain the public's trust, as free foreign exchange transactions are constantly guaranteed, and so on.</p>
<p>Major Exchange Rates Unchanged Yesterday</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports: "This morning (the 10th), the exchange market in this city was calm. Major exchange rates were essentially unchanged from yesterday (the 9th). The excitement of the past few days has disappeared. Businesses are adjusting themselves to respond to the new situation, but foreign exchange purchased at the new exchange rate level is still limited to a narrow range. There is no hope that imports into Shanghai will decrease immediately. A large number of various imported goods have been ordered from overseas in the past few months. Most merchants have pre-purchased foreign exchange at the previous exchange rate to pay for these imports, with cotton being a prime example. Currently, the raw cotton ordered for Shanghai yarn mills can meet their needs until the end of next month. The foreign exchange has also been settled. Therefore, the large shipments of raw cotton coming from India and the United States in the next six weeks will be at an exchange rate of eight and five pence."</p>
<p>Japanese Yen Rate Lower Than Legal Tender</p>
<p>Rumors that bank personnel in this city have been handling the foreign exchange situation irregularly in the past three days have not subsided. However, in fact, these rumors seem to be unfounded. No one in Shanghai knew about the actions of the Hong Kong fund in advance. Some banks have suffered losses because they have over-sold. In the foreign exchange market here this morning, the Japanese yen rate was again lower than the legal tender. Exchange shops bought Japanese yen at 99.2 fen and sold it at 99.75 fen. Earlier this morning, the Japanese yen exchange rate was bought at 1 yuan and 1 fen of legal tender and sold at 1 yuan and 2 fen. Ten-ounce gold bars reached a new high price again this morning, totaling 2,466 yuan.</p>
<p>HSBC Supplies Black Market to Stabilize - HSBC and other banks are still responsible for supplying the foreign exchange needed by legitimate merchants as much as possible, but they must rely on the order forms of each bank. Since the implementation, speculators have been unable to manipulate the foreign exchange market, and the Japanese plan to speculate in foreign exchange has failed. At the same time, China's trade deficit can also be reduced. The chaotic state of the Shanghai black market has disappeared, and foreign exchange prices are stabilizing. The exchange rates announced by HSBC yesterday were six and a half pence for the British pound and 12.625 yuan for the U.S. dollar, the same as on the 8th and 9th.</p>
<p>The Equalization Committee Exerts Efforts to Maintain Stability - The Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee has decided to continue its efforts to maintain the foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market. The restriction of foreign exchange supply by HSBC and other banks may have been instructed by the committee. The committee will resume the supply of foreign exchange when the black market foreign exchange reaches the level line. As for the level line exchange rate, it is unknown to outsiders. According to the observation of a foreign exchange expert, the rumor that the Ministry of Finance will announce the level line exchange rate is definitely not true. The exchange rate of foreign exchange in the black market will not fall any further.</p>
<p>China's Financial Gains are Significant - A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the banking community yesterday that although merchants in various industries may have suffered losses due to the tightening of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, this measure is very beneficial to China's entire financial system. In the past, Japanese goods accounted for the largest share of imports into China. From January to April of this year, they were valued at 98,538,000 yuan in national currency. After selling the goods, Japanese merchants obtained legal tender and speculated in foreign exchange on the black market, resulting in a huge leak of China's foreign exchange. In the future, the Japanese side will no longer be able to speculate.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Order Cotton in China - Japanese yarn mills in China export a large amount of Chinese cotton to Japan, providing sufficient raw materials for industry and munitions. For example, last year's exports were valued at 11 million yuan in national currency. At the same time, they ordered foreign cotton from India and other places to be transported to China for Japanese yarn mills to spin fine yarn. From January to April of this year, cotton imports were valued at 38,870,000 yuan in national currency. The foreign exchange for these cotton imports was all speculated in the Shanghai black market. However, the import of foreign cotton into China will inevitably be affected by the tightening of foreign exchange in the future.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Sends Large Sums to Stabilize Market - According to a reporter from the New News Agency, HSBC continued to be responsible for maintaining the supply of legitimate needs in recent days. At the same time, Hong Kong sent a large amount of foreign exchange to Shanghai yesterday to stabilize the market. Therefore, although one party used various methods to engage in activities, attempting to absorb and disrupt the foreign exchange market, the truth about the new measures of the Equalization Committee has become clear, and people's hearts have stabilized. Therefore, the foreign exchange market has stabilized.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Desperately Attempts to Grab Foreign Exchange - The Continental News reports: "The Shanghai foreign exchange market was mostly inactive throughout the day yesterday (the 9th), but it appeared quite stable at the close last night. Brokers from the Yokohama Specie Bank desperately tried to grab as much foreign exchange as they could get. The bank received orders to purchase over 600,000 U.S. dollars of foreign exchange last night. However, according to reliable sources, many of these orders were not fulfilled and seem likely to be shelved for a long time." Some well-informed brokerage sources admitted that the Japanese side had indeed managed to obtain some foreign exchange yesterday to pay for cotton, but a large amount of foreign exchange is needed to pay for Indian cotton scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this month and in mid-July, and the total amount of foreign exchange obtained yesterday was very small and insufficient to meet the needs.</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Mills Purchase Large Amounts of Indian Cotton - In view of the current labor situation in the country, it has been decided to manufacture most of the Japanese cloth in China. In accordance with this policy, Japanese yarn mill owners have used foreign exchange obtained in Shanghai in recent months to purchase raw cotton and increase their reserves. This has been learned from a survey of the financial and commodity markets in this city. Japanese yarn mill owners ordered large amounts of Indian cotton in April and May, scheduled for delivery in June and July. Most of it is scheduled for delivery in Shanghai, and some has already been shipped to Japan. However, whether it is shipped to Japan or Shanghai, the foreign exchange necessary for the yarn mill owners to pay for the goods is mostly dependent on Shanghai.</p>
<p>Contracts Will Be Terminated in the Future - It was reliably claimed by financial circles yesterday that the Sino-British Equalization Fund Management Office's move to not support the old exchange rate has had the effect of curbing the large-scale import of Japanese cotton goods into Shanghai. Although it is difficult to completely block these imports, it is believed that they will be greatly reduced. Unless the Japanese side can obtain the foreign exchange necessary to pay for cotton in Shanghai or elsewhere, they may be forced to terminate some contracts.</p>
<p>Cotton Orders Valued at Tens of Millions of Pounds - A reporter asked brokers about the Japanese purchase of cotton yesterday. Most of them said they knew little about the cotton prices, but made various estimates. It is estimated that the cotton purchased by Japanese yarn mill owners in Shanghai and Japan, scheduled for delivery in the next three months, totals as much as 25 million pounds. This figure cannot be considered reliable, but it is certain that Japanese cotton orders have reached tens of millions of pounds.</p>
<p>Japanese Plans Shattered - Shanghai is a source of foreign exchange, no different from a small gold mine for Japan. Until Wednesday morning, when the Hong Kong Administration stopped supporting the market, Japanese yarn mill owners, unable to obtain the necessary foreign exchange in the country, felt that this city was a bright spot, albeit a dim one in appearance. The Japanese side sold cheap Japanese yen in the local market and found its sales among travelers, tourists, and speculators. The legal tender they received was all converted into foreign exchange. This foreign exchange was mostly used by Japanese merchants to pay for imported goods, and it is heard that some of the foreign exchange was transferred to the Japanese military, but its main purpose was to purchase raw materials to supply Japanese industry. Today, the Japanese purchase of large amounts of foreign exchange has been curbed, at least temporarily. Everyone agrees that if the financial situation remains unchanged as it is today, Japanese banks will still be able to obtain some foreign exchange, but its amount is likely to be insufficient to meet the import of raw materials necessary for the expansion plans of Japanese industrialists here.</p>
<p>Shanghai People Buy Little Foreign Exchange - Only the Japanese attempt to purchase foreign currency was the feature of the Shanghai foreign exchange market yesterday. Chinese and foreign merchants and importers did not attempt to purchase foreign exchange yesterday, after rushing to purchase it on Wednesday afternoon and the day before. As a result, exchange rates were quite stable yesterday morning. Some smaller banks that still had foreign exchange on hand sold it at an exchange rate slightly lower than that quoted by HSBC. One hundred U.S. dollars cost nearly 800 yuan of legal tender. Except for the Japanese side, it was rare to see Shanghai people buying foreign currency at this high price.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Explains Foreign Exchange Situation - Reuters, Chongqing, 10th - The Ministry of Finance issued a statement today regarding the foreign exchange situation, stating that the established policy of the Chinese government is to maintain a monetary system suitable for the national economy and the basis for legitimate trade. This policy is not changed by the actions of the Equalization Fund Committee in temporarily not supporting the foreign exchange market. The actions of the committee are naturally approved by the government. The lack of balance in China's payment difference has gradually been discovered. Imports have greatly increased recently, mostly non-essential. The adjustment of exchange rates can help to correct this and create a more stable situation.</p>
<h3>British Police Officers Reluctant to Learn Japanese; Municipal Council Stipulates Japanese Language Allowance, British Officers Too Busy, Remain Indifferent to the Matter</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the Municipal Council provides cash to British and other foreign officers in the police force who study Japanese. This news was disclosed in a circular issued by the General Headquarters of the Police yesterday evening (9th) to all police stations in the Public Concession. The circular only stated that the Municipal Council has approved the issuance of</p>
<p>cash allowances to foreign First Group personnel in the police force who wish to learn Japanese, ranging from 250 to 500 yuan (Shanghai currency). This will be paid upon completion of the elementary and advanced courses, provided they pass the stipulated examinations to qualify for the allowance. Yesterday evening, the reporter asked several British police officers if they would take the opportunity to receive this 500 yuan. Their</p>
<p>answers were all the same: They are too busy dealing with the current crime situation in Shanghai and have no time to dedicate to learning Japanese. Moreover, the 500 yuan allowance is not enough to induce them to spend several months learning to speak Japanese.</p>

<h3>Puppet Regime Controls Cocoon Production, Imposes Special Dry Cocoon Tax, Already Collected in Wuxi, Silk Farmers Lament Bitterly</h3>
<p>The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, due to their suitable climates, have always been extremely abundant in silk production, accounting for more than two-thirds of the country's total, holding an important position in foreign trade. Starting in 1932, the National Government's Ministry of Industry actively engaged in improving and distributing improved breeds to develop silk production, and established training institutes for sericulture personnel. Production saw historical increases, reaching more than 3.5 million sheets annually, exporting more than 1 million bales of raw silk, breaking previous records. Since the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, all silk-producing areas have suffered severe devastation. Subsequently, the Japanese puppet regime, in order to seize economic interests, organized the "Central China Silk Company" to force the purchase of silkworm eggs from the people at low prices. All cocoons were seized, and the "company" made a profit of more than 2 million yuan last year. This year, the "Central China Company" has made demands on various mulberry farms, requiring each farm to dispatch a Japanese manager to manage all silkworm eggs stationed on the farm, which would be distributed by the "company" without duplication or transfer, attempting to further monopolize and manipulate. However, the farm owners firmly refused and resisted justly, so this plan has not yet been fully realized.</p>
<p>Guarantee Deposit Required for Purchasing Spring Cocoons</p>
<p>This year, the spring cocoons in Wuxi, Yixing, Changzhou in Jiangsu Province, and Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Yuhang, Haining, etc. in Zhejiang Province have been successively launched on the market. The puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department" did not succeed in implementing control last year, so this year it decided to abandon control in Zhejiang Province, but still implement it in Jiangsu Province, stipulating that those who wish to purchase spring cocoons must register in advance and pay a guarantee deposit of three yuan per market dan for dry cocoons, calculated at fifteen market dan per single stove. Silk factories in the city are reluctantly purchasing to maintain operations due to raw materials, but the quantity has been greatly reduced compared to before.</p>
<p>Puppet Finance Department Levies Special Dry Cocoon Tax</p>
<p>The puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Government Finance Department" has formulated regulations for the collection of "business tax" on all industries, calculated according to business income and capital. Recently, in view of the spring cocoons being launched on the market, in order to scrape together money, it has also formulated a special business tax for dry cocoons, and has set up a bureau in Wuxi, where silk is concentrated. It has also sent personnel to set up "offices" in counties with relatively abundant silk production to collect the tax. Ordinary silk farmers are burdened by this harsh tax and are lamenting bitterly.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Maintains Food Supply and Military Provisions, Strictly Prohibits Smuggling of Grain to Supply Japanese, Stipulates that Food Grain Can Only Circulate Within the County, Inter-County Assistance Must Be Approved</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government has repeatedly issued orders to investigate and prohibit the supply of food grain to the Japanese in order to maintain food supply and military provisions for the people. Now, in view of the fact that many counties are still smuggling for profit, resulting in daily increases in rice and wheat prices, special revised investigation and protection measures have been issued to all counties for compliance, stipulating that in the future, food grains such as rice and wheat can only circulate within the county.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Exporting from the County</p>
<p>All civil servants, self-government personnel, and team officers and soldiers should strengthen the protection of rice and wheat within the county. If there are any cases of obstruction, extortion, or corruption, the county magistrate should investigate and deal with them severely. If there is a real need for mutual assistance between counties, the person applying for assistance should state the facts of the need for assistance, as well as the type and quantity, location of assistance, and the name and address of the purchaser, and submit it to the county magistrate in charge for responsible review and confirmation, and then consult with the neighboring county.</p>
<p>Joint Submission to the Provincial Government for Approval</p>
<p>Then the county will fill out a purchase and transportation certificate, purchase from the neighboring county, and exchange it for a transportation certificate before it can be transported to the assistance location. Those who use public office for private gain, attempt to supply the Japanese, or confuse and profit will, once discovered or reported, in addition to severely punishing the applicant for purchase and transportation in accordance with the law, the county magistrate in charge should also be severely punished to clarify important responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Store Owner Passes Away from Serious Illness, Running-Street Takes Advantage of the Situation to Rob, Embezzles Funeral Expenses and Account Funds, Zhu Fenghang Sentenced to One Year</h3>
<p>Zhu Fenghang (31 years old) from Jiading had been a running-street for the Gonghe Rice Store at No. 19 Kang'nao Road for fifteen years. Recently, the store owner, Gu Hexing, became ill, and entrusted him with all the money and property. On the 6th of this month, Gu Hexing died of his illness. His sister-in-law, Shen, instructed him to withdraw 500 yuan from the Central Bank to handle the funeral. Unexpectedly, Zhu saw that the store owner had died and suddenly changed his nature, taking advantage of the opportunity to take 390 yuan in legal tender from the silver box</p>
<p>stealthily and hide it on his person, and embezzled and did not return the 500 yuan he had taken from the Central Bank. He hid in the Daxing Inn at No. 442 Guangxi Road. At about 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, he wrote a letter stating that the money he had embezzled was allowed by the deceased Gu Hexing, and asked for his bedding and clothing boxes to be brought by Liu Hongde, etc., to the store to take them. After receiving the letter, Gu Shen felt very strange, because Zhu Fenghang had embezzled the above</p>
<p>two amounts of legal tender, totaling</p>
<p>890 yuan, and hid without showing his face. He dared to write a letter notifying and deceiving, and still wanted to take back his bedding and clothing boxes. So she asked Liu where Zhu Fenghang was staying. He said he did not know. She did not give him the items and secretly ordered a store clerk to follow Liu to the Daxing Inn on Guangxi Road and saw Zhu walking out of the inn and talking to Liu and eating in a nearby restaurant. So she flew to report to the old patrol of the camp and sent a detective to</p>
<p>arrest Zhu and transfer him to the Gordon Road Police Station for detention. He was then escorted to the Criminal Division III of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution for embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, stating that the defendant should not take advantage of the store owner's death to embezzle urgently needed funeral expenses, which is tantamount to robbing in a fire, and requested severe punishment. After Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendant, Zhu Fenghang was sentenced to one year of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Russian Transporting Opium, Intercepted on a Vehicle, Awaiting Arrest of the Principal Offender for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Russian Luo Xinggao Yiwang (transliteration), 25 years old this year, is a patrol leader at the Taikoo Company Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession. Recently, the Russian has taken advantage of his position to specialize in sheltering people transporting opium. At 7:30 AM yesterday, the Russian, together with a Chinese, hired two rickshaws with a large leather suitcase, traveling through the intersection of Tianzhutang Street on the French Avenue, and was seen by Chinese patrol No. 868. Suspecting their behavior, they stepped forward to stop and search them, and found that the suitcase contained opium, weighing 36 catties, worth more than 5,000 gold. The Russian was arrested, but the Chinese who was following behind saw that the Russian had lost the situation and ordered the rickshaw puller to flee. The Chinese patrol brought the Russian and the opium back to the police station. According to his confession, the opium was brought to Shanghai from Tianjin by a Chinese on the Shuntian Wheel, who instructed me to send it, promising a reward of 200 yuan. Yesterday, he was escorted to Criminal Division I of the Second Special Court, requesting bail and requesting to arrest the principal offender who was on the run and investigate and prosecute. After hearing the defendant Russian, Judge Liao Yu approved the postponement to arrest the principal offender and then interrogate.</p>
<h3>Six Houses Collapse in Xinbeimen, Nanshi, Fortunately No One Was Injured</h3>
<p>The houses in the Anping Street area inside Xinbeimen in Nanshi collapsed suddenly at 7:00 PM the day before yesterday (9th) due to years of disrepair and dilapidation. The sound was earth-shattering. Subsequently, the North District Fire Brigade of the Refugee Area dispatched many firefighters and drove to the scene to rescue. As a result, six buildings at Nos. 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 collapsed. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
<h3>More Than a Thousand Tenants in Qunshou Lane Are Also Ordered to Move Out, Housing Disputes Emerge One After Another, All Sectors of Society Express Deep Concern</h3>
<p>Incidents of rent increases and orders to move out of houses in the city have continued to emerge one after another recently. For example, the moving-out disputes in Qingyu Lane on Chongqing Road and Dayou Lane on Macau Road have not yet been resolved. The rent increase incidents in Chengji Lane on North Suzhou Road are also continuing to be contested. At a time when the cost of living is high, this housing difficulty is of even greater concern to all sectors of society. It is learned that all the tenants in Qunshou Lane on Baker Road, more than a thousand people, have also encountered the misfortune of demolition and moving out. According to reports, the houses in the lane are leased by the Hua'an Hequn Insurance Company. Now, because the owner wants to rebuild new houses, all plaintiff tenants were notified to move out by the end of August this year in order to start construction.

<h3>Pan Qiahe and Others Are Blinded by Greed, Selling Fake Travel Permits, Countless Travelers Deceived, Eleven Defendants Detained Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Pan Qiahe from Nanjing, seeing that Chinese people frequently entered and exited the occupied areas and that travel permits were in great demand, conspired to organize the Wanguo Commercial Company in Room 78, No. 266 Beijing Road, and served as the director of general affairs. On the other hand, his accomplice Weng Da rented rooms in Zhiyuan, Santai, Wuxi and other hotels to establish a Hezhong Company, which communicated with Wanguo.</p>
<p>Colluding with Each Other</p>
<p>They specialized in selling fake travel permits and epidemic prevention certificates issued by the Japanese army to merchants traveling to and from various occupied towns, defrauding money for profit and squandering it, while those who carried these certificates did not know that they were counterfeit. They still regarded them as amulets, and were embarrassed by the Japanese troops stationed along the way. Over the months, countless people lost money. Recently, a person surnamed Sang reported to the General Patrol Room, and detectives Kang Zengxiang and Peng Bingsheng, together with Western detectives, successively arrested Pan Qiahe, Weng Da and other eleven people, and confiscated</p>
<p>Forged Documents</p>
<p>and books, and were handed over to the First Special District Court and ordered to be detained for investigation. The case has now been thoroughly investigated by the investigating detectives. According to Pan's confession in the police station, Wanguo Company was established in February of this year, and the number of travel permits sold was about 100, all of which were sent by Qian Yong, an apprentice of Hezhong Company in the Wuxi Hotel. There were three types of certificates, with different periods, so the prices were also divided into two yuan, four yuan, six yuan, etc. Yuan Youru was a running-street hired by Wanguo, etc. Although Yuan Wu admitted to participating in the sale of fake certificates, he had been certified by the deceived people to the police station that Yuan had filled out application forms for them.</p>
<p>Qian Yong Confesses</p>
<p>He repeatedly sent certificates and took photos to Wanguo at the behest of his master, Weng Da. Although Weng Da admitted that he had established Hezhong Company in Santai Hotels in Wuxi, he said that the fake travel permits were purchased from Ni Rongfa, who asked his younger brother Ni Zhenji to send them. A total of 180 were purchased. In addition to selling 100 copies to Wanguo, he sold the rest himself. Ni Zhenji also admitted to sending the certificate to Weng at his brother's order, but Ni Rongfa had fled without a trace when the case occurred. In addition, Li Qingshan, Ren Shouheng, Zhou Daoqing, Zhang Zhifang, Wang Yifu, and Shen Fugen all belonged to the</p>
<p>Hezhong Company</p>
<p>'s hired partners, and were all engaged in fraudulent work. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the criminals Pan Qiahe and others to the court. Judge Dai Rongduo opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the investigation and asked for punishment according to the law. Afterwards, the court interrogated each defendant one by one, and the defense lawyers of Weng Da, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, concluded the debate. Judge Dai ordered all the defendants to be returned to custody and scheduled the sentence.</p>

<h3>Barber Sets Up Flower Gambling Den, Sentenced to Six Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Since flower gambling and drugs have spread into the Concession, countless people have been victimized. Although the Concession authorities have ordered the arrest of the flower gambling kings Mao Axiang and Li Xiaobao, it is impossible to capture them because they rely on special forces. The detectives of the French Police Station's Gambling Squad, Liu Kunbao and Xie Guangming, learned that Yu Wangshi, also known as Yu Fangshi, the owner of the Huanghe Barber Shop at No. 94 Lagnaga Road, had recently privately set up a flower gambling listening tube and secretly collected flower gambling money slips at the alley across the street by Yangzhou barbers Qian Zhengqing and Yin Fuquan and sent them to the Datong in Caojiadu.

Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to Criminal Division VIII of the Second Special Court. Yu Wangshi hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing for defense. Yuan Jiahuang, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Bureau, explained the case and prosecuted according to the law. When asked about Yu Wangshi, Wu admitted that he had privately set up a listening tube and that the person who collected the flower gambling money was a tenant who lived on my attic floor and I did not know about his collecting flower gambling. The money copied out was saved at home for doing business. Yin is a partner in my shop. When interrogated, Qian Zhengqing confessed that he had been unemployed and had difficulty making a living and collected flower gambling money, extracting 19 cents per thousand. Yin confessed that he had played flower gambling and did not admit to being a flower gambling sailor. After Judge Qiu verified the confession, he sentenced Qian Zhengqing to six months of imprisonment on the spot. If he commuted the fine, he would offset one day of imprisonment with three yuan. Yin Fuquan was fined 10 yuan. Yu Wangshi was innocent and released on the spot. The money copied out was temporarily stored in the court and will be returned after the judgment is determined.

In the unofficial market, because various rumors in the market had gradually dissipated, and all parties were clear about the truth about the restrictions on the supply of foreign exchange, and the HSBC Bank was willing to maintain the supply of large amounts of settlements for legitimate commercial import trading firms at the listed rate, and Hong Kong Telegraph also sold non-stop, people's hearts gradually stabilized, and the market gradually entered the right track.

Later, a Japanese trading firm also sold spot US exchange rate to Zhengjin Bank at 12.8125 yuan, and a certain bank also sold spot US exchange rate to trading firms at 12.625 and 75 yuan, so the situation returned to flat.

<h3>Gold Pound Rises Again - Exchange Market Stabilizes, Gold Notes Loosen, Japanese Yen Still Difficult to Revitalize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold did not move, the British and American exchange rates fell by 0.125. The foreign exchange in Shanghai was strong, but the supply of foreign banks tended to be smooth, and many speculators also made profits and supplied. The market was slightly loose, and the British exchange rate closed at 6 pence 0.5625, and the US exchange rate closed at 12.75 yuan. It is thought that this is the level of foreign exchange. The spot market opened, and the gold firms absorbed it enthusiastically. The market continued to be strong, rising 20 yuan compared to the previous day. General speculators took advantage of the surplus and worked hard to lift it, reaching a peak of 2,485 yuan. However, the foreign exchange has stabilized, and those who made profits rushed to sell, and the rising wind suddenly stopped. The afternoon transaction was still strong, and the market trend was rotational. As a result, it rose 27 yuan compared to the previous day. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were in great demand, and the supply was not smooth, and the market price continued to rise. British and American gold notes, because the foreign exchange was stable, and the supply of those who made profits was strong, the market price loosened. The supply and demand of Hong Kong notes were comparable, and they were quite stable. The French franc notes, Dutch notes, etc. continued to become more expensive to make up for the shortage of the previous two days. The Japanese yen was ultimately difficult to revitalize. The Japanese gold notes once reached 1 yuan and 0.05 centimes, and then fell back to 9.85 cents. The Korean notes were quite stable, and the late closing was 8.45 cents. The association's transactions did not open. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pound rose 40 cents, British gold note fell 50 cents, American gold pound rose 50 cents, American gold note fell 11 cents, French franc note rose 3 mils, Singapore note rose 15 cents, Dutch note rose 19 cents, Annam note rose 10 cents, Rupee note rose 8 cents, Canadian note rose 10 cents, Philippine note rose 5 cents, only Hong Kong notes, Australian gold notes, Logic notes, Italian notes, and German gold notes did not change.</p>
<h3>Call Rate Suddenly Rises by Six Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange clearing bills fell downward, from 50.05 yuan per 1,000 yuan in the morning to 50.025 yuan in the afternoon, which was 5 mils lower than the previous day. As for the call rate of the Money Industry Association, it suddenly rose by six points, totaling 18 cents. When asked about the industry, it was said that this is a common occurrence on the 5th or 10th of each month.</p>
<h3>Securities. New Methods for Trading Government Bonds. Using One Set of Funds as Two. The Downturn in Foreign Debt Has Subsided</h3>
<p>Yesterday's over-the-counter securities market turned firm and stable again. Category C bonds broke through the 30 yuan mark again. At this juncture, buying and selling have occurred countless times. The strength of the bulls is evident. It is understood that large investors can use one set of capital to make several times the transaction, that is, use the inherent capital to buy government bonds, and then transfer the goods received to others for short selling, that is, use the proceeds as collateral, and then use this money to buy government bonds again. The funds for this second purchase are essentially interest-free loans. Buying in this rolling manner, the shorts are appropriately used and get unexpected high profits. The shorts bid up the price to cover, and the longs slightly release. All environmental changes have nothing to do with the government bonds themselves. The government has repeatedly stated that it will maintain the credit of the bonds. With the interest payment period approaching, the bulls are even more fearless. Therefore, the market price has been looking small in recent days, but the result has been a rise. This is the biggest reason. When the market opened yesterday afternoon, Tiansheng, Yu Da, Lianhe, and Jin Yi were keen to buy. Shuntai was exclusively interested in Category B bonds. Although there were sellers such as Nos. 10, 41, 60, and 77, the demand still exceeded supply. The price rose by 20 to 45 cents in the morning. Category E bonds fell slightly due to the ex-drawing calculation. In the afternoon, the buying sentiment was strong again. Yongkang, Runli, and Hengfu all had considerable buying interest. Songmao bought Category E and sold Category C. Yongfeng, Hongda, and No. 20 slightly sold off. The market price rose by another 10 to 20 cents. The future trend is still not easy to underestimate. At the end of the day, except for Category E bonds, which fell by 65 cents due to the ex-drawing factor, the rest all rebounded by 15 to 55 cents. The total turnover was more than 500,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 62.95 62.30 62.80 Up 0.5</p>
<p>Unified B 54.85 54.40 54.85 Up 0.5</p>
<p>Unified C 52.20 52.70 52.20 Up 0.45</p>
<p>Unified D 52.40 52.20 52.40 Up 0.15</p>
<p>Unified E 52.70 52.20 52.55 Down 0.65</p>
<p>9-Hole 6.50 6.40 6.50 Up 0.20</p>
<p>Stock trading was relatively quiet. At the Chinese Securities Exchange, the seller asked for 29 yuan and 75 cents, but there were no buyers. The stock market of the Public Industry Association was active again, specializing in rubber stocks. The opening price of most stocks was relatively high. Afterwards, the stock price continued to rise. The foreign exchange rate was still fluctuating, trending towards weakening. In addition, the price of rubber raw materials rose day by day, which led to many investors investing in rubber stocks, seemingly to avoid the loss of their assets. Towards the end of the market, prices fell from high to low, but at the close, the market conditions of various items remained good, and were higher than the previous day. The number of accounts increased. The industrial stocks in the market were also very active, and the prices were slightly higher.</p>
<p>The stock market prices of various Far East companies of British merchants in London on the 9th of this month (Friday) fluctuated very little. HSBC Bank shares rose by half a pound each. The share price registered in England was 85 and a half pounds, and the share price registered in Hong Kong was 86 and a half pounds. Kulak-Limpeh Rubber shares fell by six pence, with a price of 18 shillings and 10 and a half pence. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>The downtrend in London's Chinese foreign debt market on the 9th of this month (Friday) gradually ceased. Only the Reorganization Loan British issue bond and the Daoqing and Jinghu Railway bonds continued to fall by one pound. The rest were stable. The new low price of the Reorganization Loan British issue bond was 42 and a half pounds, which had fallen to the lowest record in 1927. The new price of the Daoqing Railway bond was 18 pounds, and the new price of the Jinghu Railway bond was 12 pounds. On the previous day, 2,000 pounds of Reorganization Loan British issue bonds were traded, with an opening price of 43 pounds, down half a pound from yesterday's market.</p>
<h3>Grains. After the Settling of Foreign Rice Prices, the Prices of Japonica and Indica Rice Increased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of Du Japonica rice from various gangs in the lower reaches of the river were still blocked by the inland and had not arrived. Only more than 2,700 packages came from the Che Lun Bao Zi, Tong Kun, and other areas. After the rumors spread the day before yesterday that foreign rice would be subject to foreign exchange restrictions and settlement, people's hearts suddenly turned upward. The market was quite active at the opening in the morning. Then, the hoarders also vigorously pulled in, and the local streets also took action, so the market seemed to have difficulty in meeting the supply. The market then rose sharply. Gao Chang Japonica rice opened at 17 yuan and 80 cents. The remaining Gao Japonica rice all increased by 30 to 40 cents compared to the previous market. The price of goods that were cut through the middle section increased by more than half a yuan. Bo Dao also increased by 30 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, hoarders tried their best to search for Ke Indica rice, and the local demand was also active. A total of more than 6,000 packages were opened in the market. The high-priced goods in the market were immediately raised by a large amount of half a yuan. The other prices were higher by 30 to 40 cents. Yesterday's transactions were mostly in medium-grade goods, and two-thirds were hoarded. Du Yang Jian Bu Jian also rose by 30 to 40 cents.</p>
<p>After the fixed price of foreign rice was settled and no longer transported to Shanghai, people's hearts in the market were upward. Now, the retail price in Saigon opened at 19 yuan and 35 cents in the morning, and the price was raised by 10 cents in the afternoon. The hoarders went to six or seven hundred packages in the afternoon, and the price reached 19 yuan and 65 cents.</p>
<p>The sales of glutinous rice were not satisfactory, with only a slight increase. It is currently selling for 20 yuan and 45 cents.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton. The Peak Season for Single Yarn Has Passed. Another Drop of More Than Ten Yuan. Hoarders of 20-Count Yarn Still Do Not Relax</h3>
<p>The yarn market's atmosphere has stabilized slightly due to the quietness of the foreign exchange market, and the range of market changes is narrower. However, those who generally absorb and hoard still do not relax, so although the actual sales are sluggish, buyers are still in high spirits.</p>
<p>The current yarn market initially continued the rising trend of the previous day's afternoon, and the buying voices were still noisy. General mobile brokers quickly opened prices, rising by two yuan. 20-count Shuangma warehouse receipts were 462 yuan, and spot goods from foreign warehouses were 472 yuan. The buying sentiment was strong, but the customer sales were still lifeless. As for Guangbang Wanxing, spot goods were sold and warehouse receipts were dropped. Soon after, it was heard that the foreign exchange listing did not change much, and the atmosphere suddenly calmed down. The market declined slowly due to the lack of demand. The spot price of foreign warehouses broke through the 470 yuan mark to 69 yuan. The price of warehouse receipts was still high because many parties held on and did not release. It is said in the market that a certain someone in the exchange and the gold industry gang are in a long position and are looking up. However, there are few hoarders of 32-count single yarn, and the peak season for customer demand has passed. It suddenly fell by 15 yuan, with little fluctuation in the middle. By the closing price, the price of 20-count Shuangma foreign warehouse goods was 468 yuan, the Dou Piao price was 466 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 461 yuan. The market opened slightly in the afternoon to receive goods in the market. It was heard that the closing price of gold was high, and the buying momentum was strong, rising by two yuan. The warehouse receipt price of 20-count Bianma was 460 yuan, and the spot price of foreign warehouses was 474 yuan, but the turnover was not strong. There was some turnover among peers, but customer sales remained stagnant. It was found that a total of 1,735 packages were bought by various gangs throughout the day, with transactions between peers accounting for 1,280 packages. The market price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 4 yuan, Tiannv rose by 3 and a half yuan, Shuangdiqiu rose by 4 and a half yuan, Muyang rose by 1 yuan, and Wufu fell by 1 and a half yuan. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows: Peers 1,280, Shantou 60, Hong Kong 265, Mainland 130, Total 1,735.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market started well and then weakened. Actual sales were sluggish. Only the peer-to-peer rubber ball transaction was lively. The price of this month's Yueqin yarn was 398 yuan, then returned to 94 yuan, and 296 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Cotton Trading. Only Relying on Peers to Adorn. A Large Batch of Indian Cotton Arrived in Port This Morning</h3>
<p>The cotton business is still dominated by foreign cotton. 2,050 pieces were traded today. Transactions between peers were still lively. The factory purchased very little. The market price rose sharply. Transactions in Chinese cotton were rare due to the lack of goods. Only Shenxin Factory purchased 120 pieces, which were Chinese packaged India. Peers traded 300 packages of Tonghua cotton. This cotton has a better body and the selling price is also expensive. From Subei, 195 packages of Xiasha cotton arrived in Tongzhou, and 70 packages of cotton were transported to Hong Kong. The current situation of cotton is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was relatively quiet today. The opening was due to poor weather reports in the cotton area. Cotton pests were very active in the Mississippi area. The Southern spot cotton market was also firm. It is rumored in Washington that the cotton export subsidy issue will be discussed again in the recent parliament. Therefore, peers are temporarily watching and waiting. As a result, the near term fell by one pound, and the far term rose slightly by four or five pounds. Due to the sharp contraction in the Shanghai exchange rate, India's cotton exports to the Far East were greatly affected. Because the market was sluggish, yesterday, including forecasts, it fell by three rupees. Egypt fell by more than ten pounds.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Due to the chaotic exchange rate, small factories, due to insufficient inventory, were quite panicked about raw materials, and have been painfully purchasing at high prices for days, suffering not a little. The goods in the hands of peers in the market have been almost completely bought up, so it has turned quiet since yesterday. Other factories have strong reserves, and the goods ordered previously are all on the way separately, and the raw materials are sufficient for four months. The price of foreign cotton is not calculated temporarily due to the chaotic exchange rate.</p>
<p>This year's foreign cotton imports are said to be more than in previous years. Except for those transported to Shanghai by Japanese ships and those transferred to Japan, the details are unknown. Those transported by foreign ships are extremely large, and have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the British Company's RawaIpindi, coming from London via Mumbai, India, loaded 1,196 pieces of cotton there, which can be imported at 11:00 this morning, and it is scheduled to dock at buoys 12 and 13 for transfer. In addition, the Tilawa of the company managed by Duck Company, transported 8,300 pieces of cotton from Kolkata, which can arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 this morning, and it will dock at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<h3>The Change in the Exchange Rate Stabilization. By Sheng Mujie</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of a 10 million pound legal currency foreign exchange stabilization fund by China and the United Kingdom in early March, the Shanghai over-the-counter market's British gold has finally stood at eight pence and 25, and the US dollar has always stood at 16 yuan and 0625, until June 6. The Shanghai foreign exchange over-the-counter market was almost completely calm for three months. However, starting in July, the Sino-British Stabilization Fund Committee telegraphed HSBC and McCall, two banks in Shanghai from Hong Kong, and suddenly decided to suspend the sale of all foreign exchange to legal currency. The foreign exchange market was naturally shrouded in an atmosphere of panic, and other markets were also greatly shaken. Therefore, I will discuss the reasons for this sudden change in the stabilization policy and its future trends within the scope of my humble opinion.</p>
<p>#### The Establishment of the Sino-British Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund</p>
<p>To talk about the establishment of the Stabilization Fund, you must first know the market conditions before its establishment. Needless to say about last year, let's take this year as an example. Since January, the exchange rate has tended to shrink from the market price of eight and a half pence for British gold and sixteen and a half yuan for the US dollar, but both supply and demand can still adapt. Entering February, the trend became tighter, and the buyers in the market took the advantage. Since the emergence of the over-the-counter market in Shanghai, Hong Kong, which has been in the position of seller, has always been regarded as the supporter of the over-the-counter foreign exchange in the Shanghai market. However, the number of sales this year is far less than before, and the method of supply has also changed. In the past, there was no price limit, but suddenly there was a range. The market felt that the support from Hong Kong was not as strong as before. Since the supply and demand in the market cannot adapt, the exchange rate will naturally fall slowly. After February 15, the exchange rate had a sharp downward trend. Fortunately, HSBC Bank came out to be in the position of seller, supplying foreign exchange at eight pence and 125, and the market situation was stabilized. Looking at the high and low market prices of each Saturday from January 7 to March 4, you can know. But what kind of people are the buyers?</p>
<p>It is the needs of the commercial sector. Among them, the needs of cotton and wheat are large. Because the North China cotton of Shanghai yarn factories is controlled by Japan, the yarn factories retreat and purchase Indian cotton. The flour factories also have a large amount of wheat imported, and the settlement price must be paid in foreign exchange. Therefore, buyers frequently scour the market for foreign exchange. Due to the circulation of counterfeit currency in Tianjin, the counterfeit organization ordered that legal currency should not be circulated in the north from March 10. Those who hold legal currency made arrangements before this "ban" was implemented, hoping to avoid future difficulties, and they bought foreign exchange with legal currency. They have been active in the market since the end of January. The exchange rate in February was almost entirely under the pressure of the north. Although the buying sentiment in the north was not fierce, when the market price was slightly higher than eight pence and 125, Tianjin took action to absorb it at any time. Japanese merchants also frequently operate in the market, but they do not come forward and mostly entrust expanding customers to absorb. It can be seen that in the over-the-counter market before the establishment of the stabilization fund, buyers were often more than sellers. Then, the power to maintain the minimum price of eight pence and 125 was really stretched. In order to consolidate the foundation of the legal currency, the Chinese government increased the allocation of 10 million pounds of British gold to maintain the credit of the legal currency and stabilize foreign exchange. ——Regarding the Exchange Fund, please refer to my article "The Sino-British Exchange Fund Loan" in the Shenbao on March 11.

<h3>Silk and Tea. Zhejiang Cocoon Outbound Transportation Obstructed. Japanese Cocoon Prices Are Also More Expensive Than in Previous Years. The Silk Market May Rise Again</h3>
<p>The cocoon market in Zhejiang Road was caused by the destruction of most of the cocoon firms, resulting in a phenomenon of more cocoons and fewer firms, which promoted the fact that cocoon prices were extraordinarily cheap. The cocoon collection on that line has now been completed, but the transportation problem has not been resolved. The forced inability to transport dry cocoons reaches more than 10 million yuan, most of which are in the guerrilla area and a small part in the occupied area. The pressure from the puppet government has not been able to directly control it. Therefore, the threats and inducements from "Central China" have no great effect. Therefore, it changed its strategy and sent out small and large claws to contact silk factories and cocoon firms individually, so as to implement its policy of breaking through each one. However, many silk factories and cocoon merchants are deeply aware of the great righteousness, and do not want to have the suspicion of cooperating with "Central China" to collect cocoons, and have rejected the conditions of half-buying and paying taxes to pass through and limit the exclusive sale to a certain firm for export. However, some soft-kneed elements have already sold out this interest, but they have been punished by the regular army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Two days ago, 18 cocoon factories in Hushu and other places in the suburbs of Hangzhou were destroyed, and more than 3,000 dan of fresh cocoons were burned, all of which belonged to the actions of those who were alert and willing to cooperate. Therefore, in the future, transporting cocoons may be safest to take a detour through eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>This spring, Japan's cocoon raising volume has been reduced by 10%, as reported earlier in this newspaper. However, the amount of cocoon collection is still unable to be estimated due to lack of materials. According to a Yokohama telephone message yesterday, the Tokyo cocoon market is starting business this week. The spot price of fresh cocoons has risen from 66 yen to 70 and a half yen. According to the market price in previous years, it was only around 46 yen, but this spring it has risen by 54%. From this, it can be inferred that the degree of reduction in cocoon production in Tokyo this year. In addition, this year's silk costs in Japan have also increased significantly. Now, based on the cocoon price, the price of white silk 20-22 stripes should be on the 1,140 yen line, and the price of 13-15 stripes should be on the 1,320 yen mark. Therefore, after the cocoon collection in the Tokyo market ends, the trend of the silk market may turn upward again. (Detailed)</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign firms such as Xiehe, Yihua, Baochang, and Jinlong purchased more than 370 boxes of green tea from this port. The top plate price for Tizhuang Chou Rui Zhenmei opened at 268 yuan. The selling price of ordinary Zhenmei ranged from 205 yuan to 212 yuan. The market price continued to rise firmly by three to four yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware. Commodity Prices Are Rising. Sales Are Stagnant</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the asking prices of various hardware products have soared, but the sales volume in various ways has decreased day by day, so the market has become stagnant. The standards are high. The market prices on the 6th and the current market selling prices are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market. The Price of Refined White Sugar Rose by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, the sugar market has eased slightly in the near term by .25. The August price is 6 shillings, 10 pence and .75. The December price rose by .25 to 6 shillings and 1 pence and .25. The March price next year rose by the same amount to 6 shillings and 1 pence and .75. According to the Dutch telegram, 2,000 packages of the original Dutch quality 8.45 were recovered in July and August. Although the Hong Kong telegram showed a small decrease of 50 cents, it was still above the Shanghai market. Therefore, the market price set by the local guild is still firm. The price of refined white sugar has also risen by 50 cents.</p>

<h3>How to Take Exams</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>"Exams are a difficult hurdle," every student probably feels this way when they are nearing the end of the semester. Because failing an exam means not being able to advance to the next grade or graduate, which is such a shameful thing!</p>
<p>Children: Your school is about to hold exams, do you find it difficult? Now I will discuss the methods of dealing with exams with the children, which may help you solve some difficulties.</p>
<p>Exams are to measure how much you have learned in ordinary times. Therefore, dealing with exams completely depends on ordinary times, and temporary efforts will not work. Learn well what you learn in ordinary times. Master the Chinese language, practice arithmetic proficiently, and know common sense well. Then, when it comes to exams, just review the lessons you have learned several times to deal with them.</p>
<p>Before the exam, you should also pay attention to the health of your body and mind, and maintain normal eating and living habits. Because excessive effort and too much stimulation of the brain can make the nerves feel tired. By the time the exam comes, memory will weaken and thinking will become slow, which will be detrimental to the exam. Therefore, "not working hard in ordinary times, but burning the midnight oil when things get urgent" is absolutely not allowed.</p>
<p>When taking the exam, be calm and don't panic. Getting anxious often leads to "exam amnesia", and forgetting everything that has been prepared. When answering questions, read the questions carefully. It is best to do the easy questions first and then the difficult questions. If there are doubts and uncertainties, think carefully. Don't be impatient, and don't dwell on one question, leaving the rest of the questions behind. If you really don't know, leave it blank and don't answer randomly. Because non-yes, multiple choice and other test questions, unanswered questions are not counted, and wrong answers will deduct points. After finishing, review it carefully, being careful to avoid omissions or missing words in the questions.</p>
<p>Children! You should understand that studying is for yourself, and exams are to measure studying. Therefore, when you go to take the exam, just do what you know and don't do what you don't know. Never cheat or peek at others, which is a despicable behavior and a self-deceiving trick. Children who recognize the purpose of studying will never want to do this!</p>
<h3>The Death of the Chicks</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, Jue'er was really busy, because the old hen in his house hatched twelve eggs, and he had to visit them every day to see if the chicks had hatched. Now, three weeks later, the twelve eggs have turned into twelve fat and small, yellow and smooth chicks, which are really cute. In addition to preparing his homework, Jue'er also had to pay attention to their food, fearing that they would not be able to swallow rough things, so he specially ground the rice finely for them to eat. The old hen also clucked, leading her children to find small bugs to eat.</p>
<p>The chicks grew very quickly under the care of Jue'er and the hen, but they had another bad habit, which was to sneak out to play from time to time. Although the hen ran anxiously, calling loudly, calling her children back, still no trace of them could be seen. The more timid chicks, hearing the hen's repeated warnings, said: "Children, come back quickly! The fierce eagle is circling in the sky, and your little lives cannot be preserved!" So they ran back and hid under the hen's wings. What about the other ones? They didn't want to come back until they were full and had played enough.</p>
<p>Finally, one afternoon, Jue'er found that four chicks were missing. The hen seemed to be calling differently from usual. Jue'er looked everywhere and found scattered, chaotic feathers in a pile of bushes. He picked them up and looked at them carefully. These were exactly the light yellow, soft, fluffy down feathers of the chicks. Alas! The chicks finally died because they didn't listen to the hen.</p>
<p>Children, are you obedient good children? Can you follow the teachings of your parents and teachers? Although our disobedience does not lead to the loss of life like the chicks, but at a time when bacteria are breeding in the summer, for example, parents and teachers say that things outside cannot be bought to eat, but because of temporary greed, you buy dirty things to eat without telling them, and unfortunately get sick, isn't your life also in danger at that time? Therefore, if we want to be good children, we must develop this good habit of listening, because the words of parents and teachers will not make us be fooled.</p>
<h3>Investigation</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—Memoirs of Escape: Number Twenty-Four—</p>
<p>Having exhausted every ounce of strength, we barely made it through the treacherous rapids of Yama's Shoal. The Jiangshan boat, as if completely drained, rested quietly for the night by the bank of an unknown small town. At the crack of dawn, the boat, as if rejuvenated, valiantly overcame its challenges and sailed forward.</p>
<p>Ming'er had just finished breakfast and was warming himself in the sunlight, sitting on the deck at the bow, taking care not to obstruct the boatman's poling.</p>
<p>"Which town can we reach today? We need to go ashore and buy some vegetables, because the vegetables for tonight are all gone," he asked the boatman as soon as he sat down.</p>
<p>"We should definitely be able to reach Chun'an County today." The boatman, upon hearing that they wanted to go ashore, secretly felt annoyed, because their father and son would delay the journey. But since they needed to buy vegetables, he had to answer him.</p>
<p>"Are there vegetables to buy in Chun'an?" The moment he heard the name "Chun'an," he felt unfamiliar with it. Recalling his geography lessons in school, he realized he had never heard of this place, proving that book knowledge is limited. He used to get headaches whenever exams came around, disliking the abundance of homework. Now, thinking about it, the amount of homework was the bare minimum. He stopped dwelling on it. Hearing that the boatman hadn't answered his second, most important question, he quickly added, "Chun'an is a county, so it should be relatively lively, right?" "No! Chun'an, though called a county, is as small as a town. It only has one long street, which serves as its sole marketplace. Compared to Tunxi, even though Tunxi is just a town, it's far superior. Tunxi is really fun." The boatman spoke like he was giving a lecture, but still didn't get to the point, making Ming'er impatient.</p>
<p>"Is there any place to buy vegetables there or not?" Ming'er replied loudly.</p>
<p>"Where?" The boatman was completely confused. "Chun'an." "Yes, but by the afternoon, I'm afraid there won't be any left," the boatman answered vaguely. Ming'er stopped asking and went back into the cabin.</p>
<p>When wisps of smoke rose in the distance, they were within sight of Chun'an, according to the boatman's experienced eyes. But to Ming'er, it was all blurry. Since he had no sense of direction, he naturally didn't know where Chun'an was, so he wouldn't be able to see it anyway.</p>
<p>The Jiangshan boat continued to glide along like a snake, step by step, as the sun moved towards the center of the sky.</p>
<p>"Chun'an is almost here," the boatman said vaguely to Ming'er.</p>
<p>The people in the cabin were eating their lunch, eager to reach the shore in Chun'an at noon, so eating early would at least settle one matter. Ming'er sat on a pile of bedding in a corner of the cabin, chewing heartily, thoroughly enjoying his meal.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the bow of the boat darkened. Ming'er saw four or five strapping armed soldiers in yellow-green uniforms, rifles shouldered, shiny bayonets fixed on the tips, and a row of bullets across their chests. The officer leading them had a triangular leather belt across his chest, a dark face, and gleaming eyes that sharply penetrated the cabin. The mouthful of rice in Ming'er's mouth made him afraid to chew, holding his breath and staring blankly at them. Ming'er's father and others had already stood up.</p>
<p>"Where did you come from? Where are you going? What are your names?" the officer, speaking with a Mandarin accent, questioned Ming'er's father, while also looking around the cabin and scrutinizing everyone on board.</p>
<p>"We are refugees from Hangzhou, and we are heading to Tunxi. We are two families of refugees here," Ming'er's father replied in a Ningbo dialect, handing him a business card. The officer glanced at it without a word. After questioning them for a while, he walked out of the boat cabin. Ming'er followed them out. Two boats were positioned across the river, filled with soldiers. The Jiangshan boat happened to be moored in the middle of the two boats. With two flags planted on the boats, the officers stepped onto them, gestured to the boatman, and then the Jiangshan boat slowly moved away from them.</p>
<h3>Save the Children</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since the implementation of graduation exams for elementary school students, the curriculum in elementary schools has become heavier, especially in Shanghai's elementary schools. They disregard whether the elementary school students' bodies and minds can handle it, and simply cram all sorts of courses into their heads, leaving many children looking pale and gaunt, their minds wandering, which is truly pitiful to see.</p>
<p>Some elementary school students come from educated families, and after school, their families can help them review their lessons, allowing them to barely cope. But some students from business or working-class families have no one to help them. Besides facing their teachers' reprimands and being held back at the end of the semester, they have no other options.</p>
<p>Some courses are of course mandated by our education authorities, and we seem to be in no position to object. But seeing the suffering of elementary school students, we cannot help but appeal to our education authorities to quickly reconsider and revise the curriculum standards. As for those school authorities who have gone overboard, we hope they will, within their power, show more consideration for the health of elementary school students.</p>
<p>Nowadays, every elementary school student, starting from first grade, has significantly more coursework than elementary school students in the past. I don't believe that elementary school students in the past were truly dull, or that they grew up to be failures. So why take this unnecessary extra step? Many wealthy families, seeing the suffering of elementary school students, hire tutors to teach at home, which is really out of necessity. But how many elementary school students can enjoy such a privilege?</p>
<p>First and second graders are required to write compositions, and third graders are required to learn the phonetic alphabet, learning the four tones (yin ping, yang ping, shang sheng, qu sheng). I find it quite strange. It seems that elementary school students' learning ability is greater than that of university students (university graduates), because I know that many university students never understand the yin ping, yang ping, shang sheng, or ru sheng tones.</p>
<p>Speaking of the phonetic alphabet, if we want to teach elementary school students how to spell, why not use the Latinized new script? Wouldn't that be more convenient than the phonetic alphabet? Changing large square characters to small square characters is only moving from 100 paces to 50 paces. Where is the convenience?</p>
<p>Now that summer vacation is approaching, I can already picture many innocent and lively children looking dejected and exhausted. My heart truly aches! I want to shout: Save the children! (Proceeds from silent auction)</p>
<h3>Becoming a Young Radio Enthusiast (9)</h3>
<p>— Xi Ren</p>
<p>5.  How to Assemble a Crystal Radio</p>
<p>Wang Min and his cousin worked diligently, and soon they had set up the antenna and ground wire. Wang Min looked at the newly erected antenna on the roof and the ground wire coming in through the window, feeling indescribably happy.</p>
<p>"Min, watch this!" Wang Min, who was lost in thought, was startled by his cousin's shout and replied, "Watch what?"</p>
<p>"Here," his cousin said to Wang Min, holding an empty cigar box, "To make a crystal radio, because there are few components and it's simple, you don't need a good aluminum casing (the chassis of an ordinary large radio is made of aluminum). We can just use this empty cigar box to make a good crystal radio."</p>
<p>"An empty cigar box can be used to make a radio? I've never seen that before." Wang Min was surprised to hear his cousin say that a radio could be made in an empty cigar box.</p>
<p>"Yes, an empty cigar box can be used to make a radio, I'm not wrong at all. If you don't believe me, you can ask others. Almost everyone who is just learning about radios starts with an empty cigar box. Because there are two advantages: 1. It's cheap. An ordinary cigar box costs less than a dime or two in a tobacco shop. 2. It's easy to assemble and disassemble. Because beginners often like to try new things, assembling one day and disassembling the next, it would be very troublesome to use an aluminum base, but a cigar box is very convenient."</p>
<p>"Because of these two advantages, that's why people use it," Wang Min interjected after his cousin finished speaking.</p>
<p>"That's right, who doesn't like advantages? Okay, let's stop wasting time and get down to business. Look, it's almost noon again, time for lunch."</p>
<p>After saying that, Wang Min's cousin picked up a box next to him with the lid turned upside down and said, "I've already turned the lid of this box upside down (see Figure 8 for how to do it), because it's more convenient to use that way."</p>
<p>"Then, how do you attach the capacitor, coil, etc. that you talked about before?" Wang Min, after listening to his cousin's long explanation, felt confused.</p>
<p>"Take it slow, don't rush me, let me tell you. You need to drill a large hole and four small holes in the lid of this box (their positions are shown in Figure 8a). The large hole is for mounting the capacitor. The four small holes are used as follows: the two on the left are for connecting the earphones, and the two on the right are for connecting the antenna and ground wire."</p>
<p>"Brother, I'm confused again. You just said to connect the earphones and the antenna and ground wire, but I don't know how to connect them."</p>
<p>"Right, right! Min, you really are smart, I forgot to tell you. You also need to buy four binding posts! I happen to have four of those here, but you probably don't know what they look like, let me get them for you." His cousin said, and went to rummage through a pile of things next to him, took out four small items, and said to Wang Min, "They look like this (see Figure 8b)."</p>
<h3>Museum</h3>
<p>— Ji Quan</p>
<p>Little friends! When you have free time, the museum is a great place to go! It contains an incredibly rich wealth of knowledge, and it is filled with the relics of our ancestors. Yes, the museum can provide us with broad common knowledge, and we should go and appreciate the knowledge it offers us!</p>
<p>In the past, the magnificent downtown area had a museum with an extremely rich collection of materials, but it was destroyed in the sounds of gunfire in Shanghai – we lost another good friend rich in knowledge!</p>
<p>Now, Shanghai also has a museum, located on Museum Road, a quiet location, and it is visited by many people. Moreover, it is free to enter, a beneficial and inexpensive place that we should visit more often!</p>
<p>This museum is, of course, not comparable in scale to the Shanghai Municipal Museum, but it is more than enough to provide children with general knowledge for browsing. Inside, there are specimens and skeletons of many kinds of animals, such as the skeletons of whales, and there are also many ancient coins, all of which are enough to inspire our knowledge.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday again. Remember that this publication once introduced several places for you little friends to visit today, such as parks, Culture Street... etc. I will also join in the fun and introduce you to the museum, hoping that your knowledge will be as broad as that of the museum!</p>
<h3>Among the Beasts (5)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Besides Knox, Peng Qi's father, Xin, had another dog named Love. It was a hunting dog breed with fur like metal wire all over its body, and short ears and tail. It had a chain around its neck, and when it walked on all fours, the chain would clang. Its fur color was gray-brown, but its chest was white, and its paws looked as if they were wearing light-colored woolen socks. Its eyes had been scratched by a cat, and its thin body was almost covered with various scars because it was often abused. Also, because it was always locked in a damp kennel in the winter, even its bark was hoarse. Poor thing, it often lived a miserable life. Cats and mice would bully it, and its young master would abuse it, kicking and hitting it were commonplace. Because it had suffered all kinds of torment, its temper had become savage.</p>
<p>Although Peng Qi abused it, he also felt some pity for it, seeing that it was always in a bad environment, its body getting thinner day by day, its scars multiplying day by day, and its fur getting grayer day by day. Yet it was very patient, able to accept anything that came its way, and this aroused Peng Qi's pity. As for Knox, Peng Qi really hated it, but because it was a big dog, it was not easy to bully, so he both hated it and was somewhat afraid of it.</p>
<p>Besides abusing Love, Peng Qi also played practical jokes on it for entertainment. Sometimes he would also joke with Knox, his tricks were endless.</p>
<p>Knox was old and liked to enjoy some comfort. Whenever it had worked hard outside, it would have a hearty meal, and after the meal it would go to a warm room and lie down on the soft and comfortable rug by the fireplace.</p>
<p>If something disturbed its rest or annoyed it, it would make a grumbling sound, as if talking to itself. Later, the grumbling gradually decreased, and its furry eyelids gradually closed, until it let out a strange cry and fell asleep. Its beautiful and black body lay motionless on the red sheepskin rug, the black and red complementing each other especially beautifully. Before long, it had entered dreamland. At this time, it would make some low barks and whimpers, and its legs would twitch constantly. In its dreams, it might still be working to save people by the river, which is why it behaved like this. But if its master whistled, it would immediately break its dream and jump up.</p>
<p>If it was quiet all around, it would simply sleep soundly, its back against the ground, its neck and legs stretched out straight, sleeping very comfortably. So Peng Qi took this opportunity to tease it. He sat close to Knox and gently pricked its lips with a fine needle. Knox was half awake, shook its head, and rubbed its paws on its lips with disgust, but before long it fell asleep again.</p>
<p>Seeing it asleep, Peng Qi busied himself with teasing it again, because these abusive tricks were his favorite thing in life. Finally, he used all his strength and forcefully pricked its lips; Knox, hurt by the pain, immediately woke up and jumped up. The needle was deeply embedded in its lips and broke off, and was finally discovered by the two little sisters.</p>
<p>Seeing their beloved dog suffering, the sisters began to cry. Usually, they were not afraid of Knox. Although it would sometimes open its mouth, revealing its snow-white teeth, pretending to bite their little hands, it did so lightly, lightly, its teeth were almost like eggshells, so they didn't feel anything at all. At this time, one of the two sisters, the bolder one, held its lips and managed to pull out the broken needle. Knox sat there quietly, moaning softly and wagging its tail slightly; after the operation was completed, it threw both sisters to the ground and licked their faces repeatedly, expressing its gratitude.</p>

<h3>Western-Style Printing House Established in Beijing</h3>
<p>A Western-style printing house has been established in Beijing, located in front of the Yingwudian Yamen. The General Administration purchased two sets of large and small lead type from the Ying Wa College in Hong Kong, worth over 2,000 taels of gold. Huang Jun Pingfu personally brought them to Beijing and presented them to the Zongli Yamen. The Inspector General of Customs, Hart, etc., have also arranged for the Meihua Publishing House in Shanghai to procure the No. 1 regular script lead type, along with all the necessary equipment such as type cases and racks, as well as two printing presses and racks. These have been shipped by steamer to Beijing and are expected to begin operations soon. The hired printers and typesetters are all from Ningbo. Movable type printing was first invented in China by the commoner Bi Sheng. The copperplate printing of the Kangxi era and the wooden movable type "Precious Collection" printing of the Qianlong era were extremely exquisite. In the West, the use of Chinese movable type was first introduced by the Englishman Marshman, who initiated it in Penang and then moved it to Hong Kong. Recently, the Meihua Publishing House in Shanghai has used chemical and electrical methods to cast type, which is cheaper and faster. Westerners initially used steel type punches, then copper type matrices, manufactured in furnaces. Even thousands of type sets can be produced endlessly.</p>
<h3>Overseas Students Arrive at Nagasaki Island</h3>
<p>The students from the Shanghai Overseas Study Bureau have departed for America for the second time. They recently sailed on a ship and arrived at Nagasaki Island, where they stopped briefly. Local Chinese merchants gathered to discuss how they would show the hospitality of the hosts and fulfill their duties as hosts. They prepared a lavish banquet, cooking phoenixes and dragons, to entertain the students.</p>
<h3>Strict Enforcement of Curfew</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, the opening and closing of the city gates has always been strictly controlled. Recently, because the area is a trading zone for both Chinese and foreigners, there are many merchants and residents entering and leaving the city, especially those who go out early and return late. Therefore, the regulations have been relaxed, allowing them to pass with permits. However, a curfew was suddenly announced the night before last, with all gates being locked at 6 PM and no later. It is said that this will be a permanent rule from now on.</p>

<h3>Radiance in the Gallery</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>—On Hezi's Woodcuts—</p>
<p>Are the young people who are immersed in the palace of art all day long, pursuing the harmony of lines and the rhythm of colors, purely enjoying the atmosphere, pursuing taste and brushwork, as if they have forgotten the motherland and are only pursuing the cultivation of aestheticism?</p>
<p>The reality, after all, differs from expectations. One bright morning, sunlight shone from the sky onto the earth, and a piercing contrast of black and white suddenly appeared in the dim gallery, attracting the eyes of passersby. It turned out that Hezi's woodcuts were on display there.</p>
<p>Speaking of woodcuts, in the current stage of China, it is a much-needed art, because with just a piece of wood and a few knives, reality can be depicted, thereby inspiring the masses and guiding the masses. Woodcuts are not as mysterious as surrealist paintings, nor as ethereal as Taoist-like traditional Chinese paintings, but are a force, a bugle call, a leader of the times!</p>
<p>Hezi is still an art student. She usually paints nudes, landscapes, and still lifes in oil paints, watercolors, and meticulous sketches. Logically, she should only have some so-called pure art pieces for people to appreciate, doing "idle" things. But, in fact, quite the opposite, she is a female woodcut artist with a progressive consciousness, a fighting partner standing at the forefront.</p>
<p>The characteristic of her works, first of all, is the depth of her sketching skills, which is perhaps easily overlooked by general woodcut artists. It seems that the quality of a woodcut depends on the subject matter, but works without a foundation in sketching do not have sufficient expressiveness. Merely having a superior subject matter can only be considered an illustration, because without refined techniques, it cannot arouse the emotions of the viewer, and ultimately it cannot be considered art.</p>
<p>Hezi's woodcuts are now absorbing foreign styles. Originally, an artist's success, the acceptance and influence of styles, is an inevitable stage. Therefore, many of her works are derived from the study of the Belgian woodcut artist Frans Masereel. This phenomenon can be seen in terms of composition and knife technique, such as "Children, Don't Forget Your Hometown by the River!" If she could do more research on Russian woodcut artists such as V. Favorsky and A. Kravcyhenko, she could achieve further depth in her expression.</p>
<p>Recently, she is carving twelve continuous pieces of "Daughters of the Era," which are meant to indicate that women in the great era should not be good wives and mothers in the family, but should work hard for the nation and the country.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that expanding the life experiences of artists is very important. Therefore, Hezi is a promising young artist who should break away from this narrow island environment and enter into an active life.</p>

<h3>Regarding Charles Laughton: Thoughts After Seeing "The Suspect"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>Charles Laughton's popularity with audiences is the best evidence of the triumph of acting. Otherwise, someone like Charles Laughton, who is neither a stunning beauty nor a dashing young man, should be met with indifference by audiences. However, his popularity is not a stroke of luck, nor is it due to some so-called genius without any basis. His success is due to diligence and hard work, and even now, he remains the same. He is loyal to the roles he plays. Therefore, in order to understand the psychological makeup of the characters he plays, he often stays up all night. As R.R. Williamson said in "The Art of Charles Laughton," "When Laughton was preparing to play the role of Donipilli in the play 'On the Spot' - the original person of that Chicago gangster had already left the United States and retired to Italy. Laughton went to Italy, observed him, and studied him in his own environment without the main culprit even realizing it. This is a difficult example of his pursuit of absolute fidelity to the character."</p>
<p>There are many such examples. For instance, in order to experience the feelings of Rembrandt in the film "Rembrandt," he specially went to Amsterdam in the Netherlands and lived there for several weeks. Once he had determined the character of the role, it was difficult to change his mind. For example, during "The Private Life of Henry VIII," he almost had a falling out with Cecil B. DeMille over the character of Henry VIII. For someone so loyal to his roles, the success of his acting and his constant progress are inevitable. Williamson said that "He seems to be capable of playing any role." In reality, this is not merely a compliment. It also contains the reasons for his success and the process he goes through. You reap what you sow. How many Hollywood stars have come and gone, while Laughton stands tall in this torrent, and in the midst of this torrent, he appears even greater and indestructible!</p>
<p>Quintard in "The Suspect" is his new successful character (this is the first production of his own "Mayflower" company). Seeing this character immediately reminds us of Cai Chusheng's "Old Man Wang" and Lu Xun's "Ah Q." Of course, in Mao Hanxu's writing (the "Rage" we see on the screen has been adapted by Coward), he is not a copy of Old Man Wang or Ah Q. However, the three of them can be considered brothers of different ethnicities. Old Man Wang and Ah Q are insignificant figures in a historical tragedy. Quintard, however, is fortunate not to be Chinese, so he has a true "happy ending." Perhaps this is too mechanical a view. The birth of these three characters is due to the different ideologies of the authors. But even so, isn't it also because Quintard is fortunate not to be Chinese? - And therefore, this stubborn and dissolute Quintard is finally moved and experiences the joy of family life.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am conquered by Laughton's exquisite and profound acting (as a critic, one should not only accept and understand more than the average audience, but also dissect and analyze with more subtle and precise observation. From this, it can be proven that I am not a critic—certainly not worthy of the name "authority"—because I cannot.). After watching "The Suspect," my brain was completely occupied by Laughton's shadow. My ability to analyze has disappeared. So, regarding acting, how should I explain my feelings?</p>
<p>Many foreign newspapers have praised Laughton and his wife, Elsa Lanchester, for their vivid portrayal of the two characters in this play, which I agree with. But what impresses me even more is his accumulation of subtle movements. It is because of these subtle movements that Quintard's stubborn and dissolute character is vividly displayed. Moreover, from this, you simply cannot find traces of Edward Barrett in "Mutiny on the Bounty" or Bligh in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street." - In short, it makes us unable to forget his loyalty to the role.</p>
<p>The director can be praised for the scene on the desert island. Quintard carrying Jones ashore and then carrying her back to the ship from hunger is a good contrast. Jones' "sleepless night" on the island, coupled with that frightened, forced, and intermittent singing, is even more clever. Yes, Elsa Lanchester should also be praised in this regard. Her face is not beautiful, but her acting is extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>The ebb and flow of movies change too quickly, but Laughton stands tall with his diligent efforts.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Shutong's Recent Work</h3>
<h3>Is Wang Jingwei Really Going to Japan?</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors about what Wang Jingwei is doing in Shanghai. At first, I doubted it, thinking that even if Wang was mentally unstable, he would not be so reckless as to go against the tide. Later, as more and more people spread the rumors, and the more they talked, the more credible their words seemed, I began to suspect that he was at his wit's end, and might not be able to avoid being shameless and engaging in this "selling himself to the enemy." However, I still thought that if Wang still had any conscience, he would not willingly do such a crazy thing.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw the news in this newspaper that Wang Jingwei was indeed going to Japan, where he would live, who he would be meeting with, and what he was going to Japan for. Therefore, what has been rumored about Wang can be believed. What else can I say? I can only borrow a phrase from the ancients to send him off:</p>
<p>"You had better take care of yourself, lest future generations laugh at your clumsiness."</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: A Beauty's Revenge Struggles to Erase Transgressions; Love Rekindled Through Green Windows</p>
<p>It is said that Zhao Letian was guarding the machine gun when he was hit in the foot by a hand grenade thrown by the enemy. The person who threw the grenade only threw it blindly, but the shrapnel scattered, and many pieces were embedded in Letian's leg. Originally, he wanted to move the machine gun, but now he fell forward and could not stand up. An assistant next to him asked, "Captain, what's wrong?" Zhao Letian said, "Not good! I'm afraid my leg is injured. You must protect the machine gun and don't let them steal it." At this time, in the darkness, he could not see how badly he was injured. He only felt that his leg was wet when he touched it with his hand, and it smelled of blood when he sniffed it. At first, he didn't feel anything, but later he gradually felt so much pain that his vision went dark. At that time, while guarding the machine gun, someone carried Zhao Letian on their back and temporarily settled him down in a villager's house in the dark. This time, our army was victorious, seizing thirteen enemy supply vehicles, three light machine guns, and dozens of rifles. Their casualties were three times greater than ours, but our captain was injured. Zhao Le forgot about the wound on his foot because of his victory, and all the shrapnel was not removed in time. Also, because the medical care in the team was not very complete, and he was a little too careless, and the rear hospital was a little far away, after several delays, his leg became infected. So when he was carried to the hospital, the injury was already very serious. Zhao Letian didn't take it seriously, because he thought: Didn't I write to Pan Peiying and tell her: Soon you will hear the news of Zhao Letian sacrificing himself for the country. Now that I am dead, that is seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence, what is there to complain about? But later, after careful diagnosis and treatment by several doctors in the hospital, they had to amputate his leg to save his life. Therefore, Zhao Letian became a one-legged man. So at that time, it was true that Zhao Letian said to Wu Junsu in the train the day before: My parents are both dead, and I have never married a wife. I am a bachelor, and there is nothing to hinder me. But he didn't know that there was still a love history in him. At that time, there was also a friend of his who said: Zhao Letian is so brave in battle and disregards his own safety, perhaps it is also because he has been stimulated by unrequited love? This is a bit of a slight to Zhao Letian, just because Zhao Letian wrote to Pan Peiying, vowing to sacrifice himself to repay the country, people put love and loyalty together. Sometimes people joked with him like that. Because Zhao Letian is an optimist, he also likes to joke with his friends. (133)</p>
<h3>(I) These Days, Words Are Spoken</h3>
<p>One day, old age (yesterday), middle age (today), and youth (tomorrow) were talking together. Tomorrow said: "You, yesterday, are a backward person, you, today, give people realistic pain, only I give people hope and happiness." Old age (yesterday) heard the bragging of the inexperienced youth (tomorrow) and said angrily: "I have seen a lot, and I see that people's hearts are not as good as before, and the morality of the world is declining. I have recorded the secret history of everyone's crimes, and people cannot help but compliment me. If you, tomorrow, give people empty hope, how can you not know that I, old age, can announce their past misdeeds and shatter their hope?" Yesterday was selling old age, and tomorrow was full of youthful vigor. The conversation between the three became a stalemate. Only today sat with a wide-open bosom. The author hereby speaks for today: "Tomorrow has not yet arrived, so please be quiet! Yesterday has already determined people's crimes, so we must find a way to resolve them. Because everyone is already guilty, happiness is taken away by yesterday. If the sins of yesterday are not cleared, the ending of tomorrow will be in prison! Therefore, while there is still today, believe this saving proverb: 'The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus.'" — Shanghai Christian Literature Society, P.O.

<h3>Wu Xiaobang's New Dance Works</h3>
<p>— Xitong</p>
<p>Regarding dance, what we usually see is so-called social dance in dance halls or song and dance on the stage. It was truly a pleasant surprise to be able to see Wu Xiaobang's "New Short Poetry and Dance Works" at the Ningbo Native Place Association on the evening of the 6th. What Xiaobang and his students danced was neither social dance nor leg show, but meaningful dance. After watching it, I had some thoughts:</p>
<p>First, tireless efforts. Xiaobang's dance performance is definitely the fifth one. This spirit of redoubled effort and the enthusiasm for establishing dance art are worthy of admiration. Seeing him perform seven shows in a row in the hot weather, changing seven sets of clothes, and also taking care of the props, lights, and piano backstage and in front, sweating profusely, we can see his perseverance and endurance. If it weren't for his students Li Shifang, Sheng Jie, Yang Fan, Wu Shiyun, and Lu Jiji interspersed performances, allowing him to rest a little, he wouldn't know how tired he would be.</p>
<p>Second, clear dance postures. The meaning contained in the dance postures is mostly easy to understand and very clear. Xiaobang intends to create a new Chinese opera and also adopts the essence of Peking opera and Kunqu opera. Therefore, from the illusion of a layman like me, the shaking of the head up and down can be said to have something in common with the shaking of the beard of the old Chu Biao in the Wax Temple; the swaying of the buttocks of the worshiper can also be said to be the country relatives sending off the wedding procession; the "Wish" performed by Sheng Jie may be "The Peony Pavilion" touring the garden: This analogy is inappropriate, but I did have these associations at the time. As for the shaking of sleeves in the Jiaoguan dance, even the old opera fans are no more than this, right?</p>
<p>Third, appropriate accompaniment. For example, "Collecting Boys" is accompanied by the music of Russian Mussorgsky, the composer of "Children's Song in the Country"; "Companion" is accompanied by the music of German Brahms, the composer of "To the Lover"; "Nightmare" is accompanied by the music of Russian Rachmaninoff, the composer of "The Miserly Knight"; "Give a Rose" is accompanied by the music of American MacDowell, the composer of "Love Song."</p>
<p>Fourth, profound meaning. For example, "People Growing Up in the Era" walk heavily, act extremely, and dare to act with strong hands; although there is no music, the continuous heavy stomping sounds of the first turn and the fifth turn are continuous, and they also have musicality, as if a barbarian woman is dancing on a drum. "Free Man" is assisted by a brisk march, which is also very pleasing. "Hesitation" explains that seeking Buddha and pleasing him are both useless, and only resistance is effective. The hesitant person finally dies under the devil's hand. What is most welcomed by the audience is "Ugly Showing Off," and before it even comes on stage, the audience gives it warm applause. Then Xiaobang appears in a posture similar to Jiaoguan. This handling is very appropriate. It is said that Jiaoguan is Feng Dao, so Xiaobang adopted the original meaning. Sometimes swaying, ecstatic, and sometimes bowing and flattering, cringing and smiling, vividly portraying the ugliness of the new Feng Dao, I want to applaud him.</p>
<h3>Eleanor Roosevelt Writes Movie Review, Praises Goldwyn as a Gambling Hero in the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt's wife recently praised producer Samuel Goldwyn as a magical gambling hero in the film industry because of the public release of "Wuthering Heights." The story of this film is based on the literary work written by Emily Bronte, one of the three Bronte sisters, British female writers of the 19th century. The president's wife recently saw a preview of this film in Hollywood, so she published her feelings in "My Day" in the newspaper. According to Roosevelt's eldest son</p>

<p>The Biggest Reason Why Yu Shuyan is Unwilling to Perform</p>
<p>Many people suspect that Shuyan's art must have deteriorated compared to before, and that his voice is not as good as it used to be. In fact, that is all too much worry. As far as I know, he not only practices his voice more diligently than any other famous actor, but also his second wife, Mrs. Yao, and her father and daughter are all opera fans. In order to win the favor of his father-in-law and new wife, he will also seize the opportunity to act as Feng Fu again, so that they can have a great time watching opera. However, all true famous actors will never perform hastily, so as not to lose their past reputation. Mr. Yao is a famous doctor in Beiping. Shuyan is doing his best to ask his old father-in-law to diagnose and treat his previous three kinds of blood diseases (hematemesis, hematochezia, hemorrhoid bleeding), and at the same time, he is working hard to train a good qin player, so as to avoid any mistakes on stage. The dead ghost Li Peiqing was trained by Yu Sanjiao. In the past, such famous actors as Gui Fen, Qiu Guixian, and Shi Xiaoshi all played very well. Shuyan, Qing Kui, Baosen, Duokui, and others also have a lot of research on the huqin. Shuyan spent a lot of effort to create a Li Peiqing, who not only set off the performance very well, but also had a qin sound that was neither too rigid nor too soft, and completely matched his voice. Since Peiqing's death, Shuyan has been like losing an arm, and from then on, he has the intention of declining to sing on stage. Later, after many friends tried their best to persuade him, saying that you have spent decades of hard work and learned so much ability, if you lose it all, wouldn't it be a pity? So he brought Zhu Jiakui over and went to his house late at night to practice his voice every day. After training for nearly seven or eight years, Jiakui was able to figure out Shuyan's temperament, and he had long understood the various tunes of the Yu School, so naturally he made great progress compared to before. Shuyan just felt that his interest was a little better and he had the intention of performing, but unexpectedly, Qian Jinfu, Wang Changlin, and other old partners died one after another, and now only Bao Jixiang is left. Qian Baosen can still inherit his father's business, and his tricks are also very good, that is, when he plays with Shuyan, he will not be much different from his father. It's just that it's too difficult to find a clown. Changlin's son, Fushan, is simply not worth playing with. Fulu has already become famous, but if you ask him to follow Shuyan's scope, he is not very willing. (Three calls) James Roosevelt recently joined Samuel Goldwyn's organization as chairman of the board. This decision by the President's wife to praise Samuel Goldwyn may be due to sympathy for her son's joining the film industry, right?</p>
<p>The wife wrote in her feelings: "At the beginning of the film, the scene of Heathcliff Moore is surprisingly successful. Although it is not like this at the end of the film. The story of the whole film is very faithful, the handling is also very appropriate, and regarding the expression of human emotions, no one will ignore it. This is a major factor in the success of the original novel. The audience may not be able to lose their sense of story tension when watching this film. Finally, the success of love in all kinds of struggles is also what everyone of us believes in."</p>
<p>"The person who made such a film is truly a gambling hero with magic! Goldwyn told me that millions of viewers will watch this film because the film itself has this value. No doubt, before the preview, at the banquet, I saw Merle Oberon, she is a beautiful woman, and Goldwyn has been in the film industry for quite a long time, he knows what kind of films, which stars and which other artists the audience wants to see."</p>
<p>Due to the President's wife's praise in writing, people in general have paid special attention to this film. Now this film is being publicly released in New York and major cities in the United States. Whether it is a film critic or an ordinary film audience, they all admit that this film is a valuable work, and they think that the President's wife has good eyesight!</p>

<p>Movie Theaters Adjust Seat Prices Recently, there has been a shortage of steel coins on the market, which has affected all industries. Some food stores have been using stamps instead of coins to make change. Generally, movie theaters charge a charity donation of 10% in addition to the ticket price. Because there are no copper coins, it is quite inconvenient to collect change. Therefore, seat prices have been adjusted to cope with this situation. The original seat prices of the Central Grand Theater were 28 cents downstairs, 33 cents upstairs, and 44 cents in the moon building. From today onwards, the upstairs and downstairs seats will be sold at a uniform price of 30 cents, and the moon building will be priced to include the charity donation. The Empire will also follow suit.</p>

<h3>Skating Technique (24)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen</p>
<p>1.  Outside Edge Forward Stroke</p>
<p>To begin an outside edge forward stroke, the supporting leg must be kept behind, with the toes pointed outward and downward, and the leg slightly bent but not stiff. The supporting foot's toes are above the circle line drawn by the skating foot, but slightly outward. The skating knee must be deeply bent. When using the inside edge of the supporting foot to propel, more force must be applied to the heel. The body is upright with the head raised. The arms should not be raised too high. The body should lean towards the center of the circle. The skating hip must be below the skating shoulder, and should not protrude outward, as this is unsightly. The supporting hip must be behind, but not too far behind, so that the supporting foot does not run parallel to the circle line. The head must be turned towards the same side as the skating shoulder. The above is the body's position in the first style. When half of the circle line has been passed, the body must begin to rotate. The supporting shoulder, supporting hip, and supporting leg, which were originally behind, must gradually move forward. The skating shoulder and skating arm move back slightly, and the head faces directly forward. This is the body's position in the second style. When the first circle is about to end, the supporting shoulder has reached the position it will be in when starting the next stroke.</p>
<p>Regardless of which side is being used for movement, except for the skating foot, the limbs must have their positions changed midway. After the position is changed, the body and the skating leg must be slightly straighter, and the center of gravity slightly shifted to the rear of the ice skate. Before the position is changed, the supporting leg must follow behind according to the direction of movement, and the skating leg must lead in front. After the position is changed, the supporting leg becomes the leading leg. (Note: The supporting leg following behind does not necessarily have to be behind the skating foot's heel. For example, when moving backwards, the supporting leg follows behind in front of the skating foot's toes, and leads in front of the skating foot's heel.) The change in the body's position has a fixed order, that is, it must go from the first style to the second style, or from the third style to the fourth style.</p>
<p>Each large step can be divided into front and rear sections. If the body's position in the front section is in the first style, the body's position in the rear section must be in the second style. If the front section uses the third style, then the rear section must be in the fourth style.</p>
<p>The body's rotation to the second style in the second half of the circle not only reserves a position for the next stroke, but also helps to accelerate the speed of the stroke.</p>
<p>At the end of the first circle, the supporting foot quickly moves close to the skating foot and pushes forward, as if kicking a soccer ball. However, this is the beginning of the second circle. The former skating leg is now changed to the supporting leg. Following the method of the first circle, one returns to the center. Each foot must do this three times to complete the technique.</p>
<p>When the supporting leg passes the skating leg, it may be close to or far away from the skating leg, but it is always best to be moderate. I would rather be slightly closer than too far away, because being too far away is unsightly.</p>
<p>The body's rotation can be (A) started from the beginning of the circle, or (B) started only in the second half of the circle, but most people choose (B).</p>
<p>The most common mistake in the outside edge forward stroke is that the circle line is too curved and loses its shape, not forming a circle. The reason for this is that the body leans too much, the skating shoulder is not on the circle line, and when the supporting leg moves forward, it is too far away from the skating leg. It is best to exert force on the heel of the shoe. When the body's position is in the second style, it must not move at all in order to ensure that the two circles meet and there is no risk of losing shape.</p>
