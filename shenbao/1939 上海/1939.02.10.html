<h3>外電傳渝官方觀察　日本急欲求和　中日不能直接談判</h3>
<p>戰事結果視歐局發展為轉移　將來和平談判須由列强斡旋</p>
<p>（重慶）此間中國官員昨以軍事政治經濟及目前局勢中涉及國民政府之社會各事要略吿知路透社記者、彼等並切言將來中日兩國斷不能作直接和平談判、故必有一遠東國際會議、其性質類於華府會議者從中斡旋、則目前之中日戰爭庶可獲一解决、彼等相信日本今殊願結束目前之戰爭但將堅主勝利者之條件、此為中國永不欲接受者、中國提出之條件、亦同樣為日本所不願接受、故擬日軍將再大舉進攻、然後議和、以期可得較佳之條件、彼等且料列强在此媾和會議中將建談維持中國士地與行政之完整、則時促請中國尊重日本在華之條約權利、至是討共問題將成一爭點、此一錯綜事件、至今未獲妥善之解决方法、日來晋西鄂西粵東雖傳來許多戰訊、但就大體言、近數週來實無重要軍事發展、據可恃華人方面之情報、日軍若干現正悄然由揚子江流域撤退、又聞日軍且由華南撤退、華人各界以為日軍不致在湘鄂贛省取新攻勢、亦不致由華南犯桂、目前在華日軍之行動、其志似在襲取鄭州、然後沿隴海鐵路西犯潼關、以期進抵四安、此種發展、在軍事上雖無重要後果、蓋一般人相信今後日軍一切戰事、將純為增强未來之政治動作而進行、此項動作之性質、將為此間人士至關切之事件、華人各界並切言目前戰爭之結果，多視歐洲未來之發展為轉移、如歐洲發生戰爭、英法兩國為勝利者、則中國似必取攻勢、而圖進戰至勝利而後已、如歐洲仍以恊商與互讓保全和局、則列强或將以國際壓力加諸中日兩國、而使以談判終止戰爭、目前之國際發展己摧毀國際貿易種種之學理之談倫敦金融界雖力持異議、而仍主張自由貿易、但中國目前僅能用以貨易貨法與外國貿易、此蓋由中國現僅能以其物產交換軍械與子彈也、至論中國之經濟狀况，並未因目前之戰爭而起重大變化、中國民衆今已限制其經濟需要、此以當地之資源殊易應付之、中日戰爭並未造成中國社會上之大變遷、資產與文化階級仍握政府之大權、農工仍為中國軍隊之主幹、蘇聯在此次戰爭中曾積極援助中國、當然已在中國增高蘇聯之聲望、但統治中國之智識界仍堅信中國如期望獲得持久之和平、進行國家復興程序、則必須傾向倫敦華盛頓方面、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>重慶方面之談話</h3>
<p>路透社重慶電訊，謂中國官員頃對路透記者，發表有關軍事政治經濟社會之談話。談片具刋本日報端。以報人採訪與紀述之習慣與方式而言，竊疑此所謂中國官員。其資格，其責任，未必以代表中國中央之發言人而發言；故於其所言之是否恰如中國政府之態度？是否恰如政府所欲發表之分際？我人既無自而懸斷其或是或否，則此類官員談話，自應與當局之正式表示分別觀之。談話內容，牽涉頗多；其足資評述者：一、中日斷不能作直接和平談判，故必有一遠東國際會議，從中斡旋，中日戰爭庶可獲一解决；二、「討共問題將成爭點，此一錯綜事件，至今未獲妥善之解决方法」；三、目前戰爭之結果，多視歐洲未來之發展為轉移，如歐洲發生戰爭，英法兩國為勝利者，則中國似必取攻勢，而圖進戰至勝利而後已，如歐洲仍以恊商與互讓保全和局，則列强或將以國際壓力加諸中日兩國而使以談判終止戰爭；四、中國經濟狀况，未以戰爭而造成社會上之大變遷；六、蘇聯以積極援華，在華頗增聲望，但統治中國之智識階級，深信中國如獲得持久之和平，則進行復興程序時，必傾向倫敦華盛頓方面云云。</p>
<p>吾人於撮舉上列足資評述之五點之後，首先由直覺而作之反應，卽是深信於官員談話究竟未許遽與當局正式表示等量齊觀；而深疑於口吻之走樣失眞。</p>
<p>次請就上列五點，分別述所感念：關於中日戰爭者，在日本為無法收拾戰局；蓋征服中國則以估量實力而知不可能，希圖利用傀儡以華制華則以試騐失敗而知不可能，希圖以傀儡為所謂新秩序之主角則以軍事佔領區為遊擊隊所威脅而事實證明其不可能。至於中國方面，自始為應戰而非主戰，為自衛為圖存而非侵略；故根本上不欲戰，祇以實逼處此，不得不戰；且因存亡所繫，非戰勝，不敢言息戰，非日本停止侵略，撒回軍隊，不敢想媾和。惟其如此，故中日戰爭無論將來在事實上是否以遠東國際會議為結束，無論目前在國際間是吾亦有友邦向中國作召集遠東國際會議之提示，但中國方面既在抗戰圖存之中途，如何敢存絲毫希望於國際會議之使中國之停止抗戰而試為媾和？換言之：遠東國際會議之問題繫於日本，而中國在現階段中，絕對無此所謂遠東國際會議問題。抑所謂遠東問題者，原來祗是日本侵略與不侵略之問題；不侵略即無戰爭，即是和平；不侵略而謀所以善戰局之後者，遠東國際會議可也，直接談判亦可也。換言之；祗可謂日本非停止侵略不可，無所謂中國非國際會議不可。</p>
<p>關於所謂討共問題者，吾人祗疑電訉之電傳電碼錯誤。因共產黨在中國·忠貞國族·矢志抗敵，是何待討，亦不應討；日本國內亦無待討之共，應討之共；蘇俄誠為共產國家，此是蘇俄之事；事實俱在眼前：中國既未受蘇俄威脅，蘇俄亦未向日本侵略。是以遠東本無討共問題，何來所謂「錯綜事件？」何待所謂「妥善解决！」</p>
<p>關於中日戰爭與歐洲大局者，其間自有不能隔離之影響；然在中國，但願歐洲糾紛，獲得和平解决；若不幸而不免於戰，則無論勝敗如何，無論中國對各國感情之厚薄如何，無論中國所受各國交戰之影響如何，然中國在侵略之下，必繼續抗戰到底則一；應進應退應守應攻所根據之戰略因素則一；日本不停止侵略，中國必戰至最後勝利則一；豈有所謂英法勝利則反攻？豈有所謂英法勝利則始亦求利勝？</p>
<p>關於中國經濟狀况與戰後傾向者，中國經濟基礎在於尙未現代化之農村；惟在農村，故基礎佔有先天的廣大之空間；惟此空間，實為不怕蹂躪而可持久作戰，消耗暴力，制敵死命之主要因素。謂以戰爭而將使，一般經濟及社會組織發生重大變化者，惟於工商業資本國家為然。惟無大變化，故戰後之復興，端在獲得復興之助力；助力之所由，即傾向之所往；助力得之英美蘇俄，即無擇於英美蘇俄；此非主觀好惡所得支配，亦非空言親疎所得轉移者也。謂必傾向倫敦華盛頓，是誠可好可親，顧居今日而斷言之，不其過早耶！</p>
<p>總之，某官員所談及之問題，多饒趣味；顧其內容有為吾人所未能貿然苟同，為述感念於此。</p>

<p>（柏林）德國各報對於所傳英法調停西班牙內戰之消息、均認爲係「外交上之干涉」、據國社黨喉舌人民觀察日報載稱、現時正有一種明顯之企圖、欲阻撓弗朗哥方面獲得勝利之和平、英法之行動、純係爲權力及政治設想、此蓋由西班牙對於英法在地中海之地位、有特殊關係故也云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>西政府內部　意見參商　總理主繼續抗戰阿查那或將辭職</h3>

<p>（巴黎）法政府現擬根據日前以非正式使節名議赴布爾哥斯之參議員貝拉爾所携歸之解决草案、考慮承認國班牙弗朗哥之國民軍政權事宜、衆料今日國民軍可在數處到達法國邊境、內地及沿海岸之政府軍主力部隊、隨時有越入法境之可能、據馬德里消息調停殆難實現、政府仍將抗戰政府軍新司令部、大約將設於阿里康特、迦泰吉納或阿爾巴西德云、（九日路透電）</p>

<h3>推進後方建設中　今日之貴陽　擴充電廳推廣國產文化金融日趨發達</h3>
<p>軍興以來，貴州成了西南經濟交通的中心，而貴陽又正如地方誌上說的地居全省中心，據陸路四達之衝，是貴州省經濟交通的樞紐。貴州素稱山國，牠　是山業中一塊較大的平原，瀕南明河北，城周聞不及十公里，作不規則的橢圓形，放寬脚步走，從東鬥到西門，能有二十分鐘就可以通過，南北距離較長，但也不過東西的二倍而已，所以在全國省會中，算是最小的一個。在城外有黔靈山，東山，觀音洞，諸名勝。據說觀音洞能通東南二百里外都匀。這終究不過是一種傳說而已。氣候無盛暑酷寒，但寒熱變幻恐僅亞於昆明，有這樣一個特徵，就是祇要有太陽雖在隆冬能如初春，在大暑有雲陰則亦能衣夾衣。黔中本是漢人苗夷雜居之區，在貴陽的苗民也有人口十之二三，但他們除了仍短衣花裙，跣足繞髮，喜佩銀飾等等外，媒妁嫁娶，多已效漢俗，與當地人交接且能通漢語。在這裏的語言，通用四川官話，湖南官話，不過道一次眞是沿海省份人口的大流徙，下江口音居然隨處可聞。關於其他種種，我想分開報道，這樣能比較有頭緒些。</p>
<p>刷新市政　過去以連年兵燹及財政貧瘠的原因，市街建設稍差，近頓建設廳貴陽市政工程處積極改善，市街衛生，市容整齊方面都有長足的改進。民十七年起馬路兩旁市屋概限修爲三層樓洋房門面，人行道上有突出的騎馬樓，市區最繁盛的一段，爲「大十字」，類於上海的南京路，長沙的八角亭；至所謂洋房，由於鋼筋水泥運輸不易，這一筆漏巵倒是沒有的，紙不過磚砌木隔外以灰糊而已。就是新完成的交通銀行，外觀挺神氣的，也是不能例外。主要的馬路都相當廣寬，但路面是既非柏油，又非彈石的泥地，下雨後泥濘不堪，現正竭力加以翻修中。又感於人口激增，交通頻繁的緣故，爲便利交通及空襲時易於疏散，增闢了七八個新城孔，幷在南明河套圈定新住宅區。全市人口據最近統計已達十四萬奇，而尙有源源的在來，當局鑒於上月桂林遭炸的悽慘，對婦孺老弱及不必要留城的正籌先期疏散中。入夜有電燈廠發電，不過電量過小，供不應求，除主要大街外，小街支巷大都沒有路燈，今年起省府與資源委員會合作，改電燈廠爲貴陽電廠，電量擴充至一二〇〇基羅瓦特，全部機器將裝竣，這樣，兩月以後大概可以大放光明了。</p>
<p>平衡物價　因消費空前膨脹的緣故，使各業都表面蒙上一層康健的顏色，在電炬下看見肩摩踵接的繁榮的樣子，極像襤樓布衣的外面新披上一件華麗大氅。然而表面的豪華，畢竟掩不住內在的寒酸，米漲到二十二塊錢一擔了，糖鹽日用品也日見高漲，靑菜雖然可以賣到一毛錢一顆的好價，但得不償失，生活指數報紙上逐月公佈，比職前增加了二倍，當地的市民被這跳躍過一個世紀的消費壓得喘不過氣來，從別的省份流亡來的人也同樣在呌苦，屋荒閙得不亞於上海租界，過去七八元可以居一年的小屋，現在十塊錢一個月也租不到。於是空白的地皮拼命在蓋房于，木材眼見飛漲。一包無敵牙粉要一毛錢，一塊固本藥皂買到四毛，毛巾牙刷等更貴了，同樣的物品比上海·廣州要貴上三倍，所以平衡物價，嚴禁居奇，已成爲當局當前最麻煩的工作。營業最鼎盛的首推酒樓·旅社，新興的酒樓不下七八所，有蘇錫船菜，江南風味號召的揚子餐應·四五六·酒家，平津菜館如故都春，粵菜有四海大酒樓，總之不論什麽滇味·川味，却都是座客常滿，吃一頓夜飯候一個鐘頭並不是希罕的事。旅社最著的有遠東飯店，江南旅社，巴黎飯店，理髮生意也不惡，璇宮理髮應是設備外觀最漂亮的一家，理髮四毛，洗頭一毛，吹風又是一毛，所以理次髮得化六毛，他的主顧對象泰半屬於下江人，値得特別提一提的，今年元旦新開幕了中國國貨公司，資本十萬元，由中國國貨聯營公司投資六萬元，省府亦　股一萬元，這等於是一個國貨產銷合作機關，前途實有無限發展希望。</p>
<p>籌設工廠　貴州不像別的內地的省份，有特殊的幣制，有地方銀行發行的紙幣·她很早就使用法幣，過去銀行在貴陽有中央·中國農民·上海幾家，後又有金城銀行，在今年中國，交通先後成立了分行，於是中·中·交·農四家法幣銀行齊備，無疑的將使整個貴州的金融更趨活躍。工廠僅有少數火柴製草工業外，有建設應的模範工廠，近鑒於來黔難胞日多，爲使難民從事生產增進國力起見，省政府又預備在貴陽設簡易手工業振濟工廠，大規模的士敏土廠，榨油廠也正在計劃中。</p>
<p>敎育文化　專科以上的學校計有國立貴陽醫學院，上海大夏大學，江蘇醫學院以及新由長沙遷來的湘雅醫學院。中學有大夏附中，省立高級中學，貴陽中學，師範學校，女子師範學校及中大實中等十五所，小學有二十二所，其中女小佔八所，一個方圓十公里的城市，有這許多學校爲數不能算少了。所以憑良心講，貴州文盲還不如想像的多，一個普通胝手胼足的勞動者，差不多都能讀讀壁報，而女學也特別發達，中蘇文化恊會，在貴陽也成立有分會，會員五百餘人，會長王伯翠·理事張志韓·郭一岑等，對於溝通中蘇文化上他們都以最大的努力在進行，並先設立了俄文專修學校。文藝運動不能諱言的比起重慶·昆明·桂林·要沉寂許多，不過最近文化人已提出增强文化陣營，發展貴州文化而組織貴州文化恊會」，對樹立貴州嶄新的文藝基礎，實有厚望焉。（未完）</p>

<p>芋艿　乃極富滋養之品也。可蒸熟或煮熟後，每餐前食二三個，久服確有奇效。據硏究所得，此物含有多量鈣質；於瘰癧症之治療，大有助力</p>
<p>夏枯草茶　夏枯草，有散結毒，化痰瘀，消暑，淸濕之功，常以入藥，和平而有效。若於夏令，以此煎湯代茶，氣味芳香，且不甚苦；既可醒胃消暑，又能根治瘰癧，可謂一舉二得，即非暑令，亦無不可。</p>
<p>地栗　能消食化痰。患瘰癧者食之，亦甚有益。惟此物生水田中，性寒，小兒脾胃虛弱者，多食易致臍下結痛，不可使其任性而食，此又不可不知者。</p>
<p>海藻、海帶、海蜇等以上諸品，皆味鹹，因其爲藻類，中含碘質甚富，用治瘰瀝，甚有實效。</p>
<h3>桂圓膏</h3>
<p>— 何立三</p>
<p>桂圓，一名龍眼。味甘，性微溫。功能補血滋陰，益心腎。有生服，有煎服者。然以煎服爲宜：製湯之法可先剝取龍眼肉若干，加黨參黃芪，（或再加參鬚亦可，陰虛津液不足，再加西洋參二三錢。）置蓋碗中，用皮紙封固，上刺針孔，入飯鍋，約蒸十次。服時，酌取若干，加開水煎，滾透服，其味甜而不膩。桂圓本富於滋養，復得參芪等之助，相得益彰，能大補氣血，健脾胃。凡男女質弱者，服之咸宜。</p>
<h3>白帶助療</h3>
<p>— 丁健侯</p>
<p>女子白帶，患者十之八九。茲得一方，治法頗易：而其效甚捷。可向各南貨店買蓮子及芡實二味，不拘多少，蒸煮極熟，食時和冰糖少許。蓋蓮子芡實性均甘平，蓮子功能淸相火，固腎濇精。芡實功能補脾治帶，益腎療洩。合而用之，培脾腎，淸相火，濇精關誠治白帶之妙品也。惟必須常服，始有實效。</p>
<h3>鰻鯉與肺癆</h3>
<p>— 張贊臣</p>
<p>治癆之法，不外增進其組織之防禦機能，而達治愈之目的。但欲達此目的，必先使營養充足。患肺癆者，可每星期以鰻鯉魚煮熟，蘸醬油佐食，最爲適合。蓋鰻鯉富於脂肪營養成分，故能治肺癆及瘡瘻癧瘍，常食大有裨益也。世人僅知魚肝油爲治肺癆之補養品，殊不知鰻鯉實勝於魚肝油。然鰻鯉之肉，肥厚粘膩，當先審其腸胄之消化力爲衡，斟酌多少而進之，寗少食而屢食，母頓食而驟食，庶無傷食之害。否則胃肠內一時輸入此粘膩之品，非特不克營此完全之消化，且將有損其機能，而引起嘔吐泄瀉等症之息，是則不可不注意也。</p>
<h3>傷寒症之病情變化及食養程序（六）</h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>前文係言傷寒寒熱未退時之飲料食物，及後寒熱如其退盡，則腸中發炎已退，消化機能漸能活動，此時卽需食料以供消耗，與寒熱未退時之情形顯有不同。</p>
<p>甲，寒熱初退之第一日至第四日　其食料約爲五種：　飯滯粥　藕粉　麥片湯　米麵，捲麵　粵人可吃桂花粉湯。</p>
<p>飲料有八種約為：　大麥茶，　米仁茶，　桑芽茶，　紅茶，綠茶，　牛乳，　豆腐漿，豆腐花，　蘆根茶，　病久舌紅耗傷陰液者，可飲西洋參，石斛茶。</p>
<p>佐食小菜約爲六種：　甜醬瓜（吐渣），　雲南大頭菜（吐渣），　乳膏，　海蜇，　芝麻醬，　靑鹽拌豆腐。</p>
<p>水菓方面約爲五種：　橘子，　新會橙，　茡薺，　橄欖，　生梨。寒熱初退四日內佐食菜肴堪以入選者，極為稀少。蓋寒熱初退時，身體需要食物以供補充消耗，且以久餓之後，令人食食異常，久臥之軀，一旦病魔初釋，惟以飲食爲唯一消耗慰藉。故咸如渴驥求食，食慾奇盛！此時有一危機，即因傷寒愈後，肠胃消導未復常度，肠中舊創初愈，實亦不勝滯積，傷寒病復發之原因有三：　因多食復病，　因勞動復病，　因受寒後復病。其中以飲食過多復病者居最多數，因病後胃部之需要飲食甚爲强烈，而腸中舊創初愈，消化之能力，十分艱難，胃强腸弱，因是最易復病，故病中仍須戒食，上列飲料，所舉甚多，每日可取一種，輪流替換，以易口味，不宜一日遍嘗數種。</p>
<p>上列物品，在傷寒熱退後之四日中，所舉殆遍，此外物品，不宜嘗試，油膩葷腥生冷野味均忌。</p>
<h3>介紹六種滋養食品（中）</h3>
<p>— 胡祥麟</p>
<p>胡桃酒　製法：以紫衣胡桃和衣搗爛，加上好陳酒，置鍋中煮透，略加砂糖。</p>
<p>常服令人補腦生精，皮膚光潤，鬚髮黑澤，血脈通順。胡桃含多量脂肪質，能使大便通調，其衣含單寗酸，可治遺精喘飲，每晨以炒鹽胡桃二三顆和衣佐牛乳或可可飲之，亦有滋養之功。</p>
<p>山藥粉　製法：糯米一升水浸一宿，瀝乾慢火炒，令極熱，磨細篩過如飛麵，將生懐山藥微炒，碾末入米粉內，每日淸晨用半盞入砂糖一茶匙或胡桃末少許，滾湯調服。能治泄瀉，及遺精，少進飲食。蓋山藥能緩和腸道之刺激，增加腸壁之吸收。又能攝納精關故也。</p>
<h3>兒童美點「健脾粉」</h3>
<p>— 余香芸</p>
<p>小孩大多是貪食的，於正餐之外還喜食零食，但有許多零食都很不合衛生，也不容易消化：以致小孩常常患傷食和腸胃病，所以對於小孩的零食是不得不注意的。小兒面黃貪食形瘦將成疳積之時，有一種「健脾粉」，給小孩吃了，有健脾，消食，殺虫等許多功效。原料用淮山藥二兩，鷄內金十枚，芝蔴二兩，扁豆二兩，焦楂炭四錢，建蓮肉一兩，雲苓一兩，使君子五錢，白米三升，先把米芝蔴等分別炒熟，然後磨成粉末，混和均勻便成功了。食時和以白糖，或乾食或用開水冲食都可以，味甜而香，眞是一種最適合小孩腸胃的食品。</p>
<h3>廉價補食</h3>
<p>— 朱作三</p>
<p>龞　龞就是甲魚，是很普通的水產動物，四季都可食用，因牠有潜藏至陰的本質，所以冬令食之，尤爲相宜，在藥劑中常用龞的甲殼來補陰退熱。至於龞肉，其性甘平，別錄所載：「主治傷中，益氣補不足，」在新本草綱目，也列入强壯劑中，實在是補陰，（血液津液內分泌）的妙品，又治脚氣病。</p>
<p>豬血　記得總理學說，在知難行易證例中，嘗引豬血補血爲言，豬血是最賤的東西，牠補血的力量，也是盡人皆知的。據本草上言，牠能生血，又治中風頭風眩暈。因猪血裏，含有鐵質等等，經過消化和吸收，就發生增益血液的作用。至於中風，頭風眩暈等症，都是血虛，血壓過高，或貧血而至神經衰弱之故。常食猪血，往往而愈，所以「以血補血」，以乎是很　預的學說，但事實十確是極有效的。　　丁濟華，嚴蒼山，張懐霖，孫宗海，奏伯未，張汝偉，謝也農，鄒德民，張贊臣，丁濟民，尤學周，揚彥和，倪息庵，姚若零，龔醒齊，葉勁秋，秦丙乙，劉民叔，藍曉梅，曹炳章，諸君鑒：上月份稿費已經結出，即日起每日下午請具條蓋章向本館會計處領取。</p>

<h3>近時盛行之惡症天花與飢飽問題</h3>
<p>— 尤學周</p>
<p>飲食所以養生，亦足以政死，有病之人，於飲食一項，尤宜絕端注意。得其宜，固足以輔助藥力之不逮，因榮養之合理，增進抵抗病魔之力；不得其宜，徒使腸胃之消化上，多增一負担，而病魔則以有機之可乘，其勢力反見膨大。</p>
<p>「飢痧飽痘」，成語也。譯其大意，謂馬痧子者，飲食宜有節制，能帶三分飢，最爲佳妙；患天花者，則反於是，食宜求飽，不必故事抑制，减少其食量。常人以有例可援，有成語可案，對於患天花者，不復節制其飲食，——有心嘈似飢，而頻頻投以食物者，有胃呆不欲食，而强爲加餐者。最後之結果，因胃腸實滯，或起泄瀉，發生絕大之變化。</p>
<p>「飽痘」之說，雖不能絕對否認；然當相機從事，非謂無論何種痘症，皆宜滿足其食慾，使之每餐必飽也。蓋疾病之消滅，一面恃藥力之尅制，一面又須藉本身之能力，作長期抵抗；此抵抗力之由來，皆賴飲食爲之培養，疾病之能飲食者，抵抗力之產生，可以源源不絕。天花既屬危險疾病，而其經過之時間又久長，苟無飲食以培養之，即無長期抵抗之能力，故以能食爲可喜，「飽痘」之意義，須從反面着眼，——不求飽食，乃母令飢餓之謂也。然此僅指消化系統不因痘症而起障碍者而言；若納食變味，或胃口不開者，强進飲食，亦有何益！蓋食養之最大要點，在適可而止，不令飢餓，亦不宜過飽，更不可强爲加餐。</p>
<p>天花爲疫毒，宜淸而不宜補，故飲食一項，尤不宜偏執成見，致變證蠭起，陷於不可收拾之地步。據余經騐之所得，患天花者，無論嬰兒成人，初起若見微痢，——多泄則忌——其經過反順，此乃體功之自起挽救方法，使熱毒下泄，减輕疫勢，證情得以輕鬆，亦生理上一種奇妙作用也。準此而言，天花之能進飲食，固屬可喜；若不欲飲食，或所食不多者，則不可强爲進食，或食無限度，使消化上多增一負担，使疫毒有聲援而氛燄愈盛，使原屬平安之症候，而轉入於危險之境地，生死存亡，一反掌耳，家庭間負有看護病人之責者，幸母爲成語所拘囿也！</p>

<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤比上日</p>
<p>股票交易、昨日成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股五十股價爲五元七角、餘均無人過問云、</p>
<h3>金融　貸款消息復作　現金價頓形疲弱</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、續趨平疲、蓋現金號暨銀樓帮及北帮等紛來拋塞、故價遂向下降、唯中送曾因聞外滙緊軟、故又引起某銀號與港帮購買、故市價一度轉堅、卒以突聞路透社傳英將繼續貸與中國港幣六千萬元、是以人心重向下疲、致價又逼至二千零四十元關口、交易較上日略旺、銀樓飾金則未見更動、海關金及中英純金等亦均無升降、</p>
<p>烚赤暗市跌一元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開某銀樓喊二千零四十二元買進、其時某金號亦有進意、然售者要四十六元方肯供給、故雙方擯持至十時許方見做開、首見某銀樓進現金號及同業各五十兩、價均二千零四十四元爲開盤價、繼之金號及銀樓帮各互做五十兩、價均與前相同、此後因售者稍殷、價遂逐步下挫、金號售予某錢兌業五十兩、價四十三元、某錢兌業吸進後原價又進北帮五十兩、後金號又售予錢兌業五十兩價四十一元、兼之某銀樓亦來吐予某銀號五十兩、價則租同、此後因外滙受洋行扒結下、稍見軟化、故賣風頓戰、某金號亦反出爲進、且某銀號績來吸購、價即向上、某銀號進銀樓帮五十兩、價一躍爲四十五元、繼之金號進銀樓帮五十兩、價四十六元、後銀樓帮相同價又售予錢兌業五十兩、銀樓帮再售予錢兌業五十兩、價四十五元、時已十一時一刻、此後一無做開、價亦呆定、故午收價仍爲四十五元、午後二時許首見某錢兌業進金號五十兩、價四十五元、此後某錢兌業進意仍濃、然售者稀少、後又進銀樓帮五十兩、價四十七元爲最高峯、三時三刻又見銀樓帮售予錢兌業五十兩、價四十五元、其時突聞路透社傳說、英將繼續貸與中國港幣六千萬元、故而人心傾向下疲、一般浮多均想脫售、但進者多呈旁觀、價雖喊低至四十元、然仍難獲對手、致未做開、故晚收仍作二千零四十五元、較上日軋跌一元、全天六元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千零五十元、收進二千零三十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金仍　原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩售出均無更動、大同行老慶雲等仍懸原價二百零七元、新同行懸原價二百零五元、收進一百九十九元、</p>
<p>英純金未見更動</p>
<p>八日倫敦電、英純金每盎司未更、仍屬七鎊八先令四辦士、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦仍站立於一千二百十元零九角、掛牌海關依然未分榮辱、仍爲二元三角九分四庫、上海樣準標金價亦隨之呆定、仍計一千二百零六元二角、</p>
<h3>朝鮮票已做開</h3>
<p>昨日英純金與英美匯兌俱未更動、外滙需要尙旺、港電與銀行供意稍暢、趨勢微弱、烚赤供給不爽、實戶吸　轉弱、恐外滙政府維持、未敢放膽拖進、致市價盤穩、交易稍遜、外幣因匯票稍弱、價微上升、美金票·香港票·外銀行需要較殷、朝鮮票交易亦已做開、公會交易尙盛、勤泰出鴻臺進香港票五百元、利通出承泰進美金票一千元、勤泰出承泰進美金票五百元、鎭興出承泰進美金票三百元、森泰出鴻昌進香港蔡一千元、泰和與出承泰進英金票一百十鎊、昨日市價、英金鎊降五分、英金票升一角五分、美金票升三分三厘、香港票升七厘、法郎票升一厘、坎拿大票升半厘、斐律濱票升二分、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>貼現絕少變化</h3>
<p>昨滙劃栗據貼現率、呆定逾恒、每千元終日盤旋於卅五元左右、最後價爲卅五元、紿果與前日價相同、</p>
<h3>英印銀價背馳</h3>
<p>八日倫敦電、市面穩靜、詳少變化、收盤後平中略呆、大條銀近期未更、遠期回縮〇六二五、紐約銀電、美難價依然呆定、又孟買銀電、印銀市况平靜、現貨勿動、近遠期則俱長二安那云、</p>
<h3>洋麥結款紛繁　外匯復又轉緊　嗣聞英將對華繼續貸款市况遂卽由緊而轉平穩</h3>
<p>匯市昨以洋麥結款紛紜、暨其他洋行等購結、亦頗浩繁、加以外商銀行界資意淸淡、故潛勢步緊、嗣後突聞路透社傳說、英將繼續貸與中國港幣六千萬元、且港電重來拋售、是以情勢遂止緊趨平、中途稍有曲折、但無過大波瀾、成交頗旺、港滙初同外銀行納胃頗强，潛勢亦緊、後因錢兌業聞英將對華繼績貸款消息、故乃頻塞不已、致潛勢頓時回平、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近平遠縮、紐約銀行勿動、倫敦生金亦未升降、匯兌英對美縮已厘一、對法跌四生丁、對滬大零六二五、美對英未更、對法小零六二五、對滬大五分、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行早開賣價、英匯八辦士二零三一二五、美匯十六元、較上日午收英平美緊零三一二五、開外某洋行雖扒、惟其時外商銀行供意亦佳、故爲狀尙定、某洋行結進美行荷蘭美匯十六元、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無上落、此後小麥結款紛紜、某洋行吸進匯豐麥加利英金八辦士二零三一二五、與一八七五、繼之外商銀行亦進港電英金八辦士二零三一二五、後某洋行購結華比美匯僅十五元九三七五、是以過程頗緊、近午錢兌業售予安達荷蘭港匯五十四元五角、於是趨勢稍平、午後銀行賣價英匯八辦士一七一八七五、美匯——五元九三七五、</p>
<p>後市因突聞路透社電專說、英將繼續貸與中國港　幣六千萬元之說、且港電首來賣予有利匯豐麥加利英金八辦士一八七五、及美滙十六元、致過程略有回鬆、此後因洋行重來扒結、故潛勢又硬、洋行吃進　豐麥加利八辦士一七一八七五、及美滙十五元九三七五、最後錢兌　頻塞港滙、售予廣東荷蘭華義港匯五十四元半及七五、致爲狀稍平、延至晚收、銀行賣價與午收相同、英匯八辦士一七一八七五、美匯十五元九三七五、結果較上日午收英緊零三一二五、美軟零九三七五、港則平平、</p>
<h3>疋頭　白貨細斜　華廠接有巨額定貨　東貨囤戶意興甚濃</h3>
<p>國布西南現銷仍頗可觀、川滇帮添購淺色布花布色丁近一百箱、粵帮近來採辦白貨細斜殊殷、本街染坯亦有需胃、惟各華廠因接有巨額定貨、細斜出品减少、市上存額漸稀、價亦漲（每疋）一角左右、昨由粵帮購去各牌五十件之譜、本街購去一百數十件、價在十一元至十一元六角、閩帮續辦色斜籃布綫呢嗶嘰六十餘件、北路烟台帮辦嗶嘰漂布四五十箱、本街批發號購現貨大鵬孔雀富賣細布近五十包、三四月份期貨、鴻章三羊條府綢近二百箱、價每碼四角八分、</p>
<p>東布市氣續佳、同業心思生意愈益熱鬧、囤戶及本街染廠搜辦細布細斜現貨又有一千餘件、售槃俱漲（每疋）五分至七分半、龍頭細布現貨售開十一元九角、而期貨三四月份東棉訂出價、（每疋）則爲十二元二角半、其他如彩球飛魚猶須提高五分、（每疋）售十二元二角半至三角、綜計各行開售、續有五六百件之譜、</p>
<h3>糧食　客秈銷路尚活　杜米交易有限</h3>
<p>客秈昨晨被本尖回跌影響、進戶觀望、成交不足千包、市面頓趨疲軟之象、及至下午忽有囤戶趁低吸收、先後復有二千多句成議、市形立即由疲轉佾、高中各貨一律喊高角外、南京高秈貨缺未開、高蕪秈乃昂至十元○九八角、大市貨十元○二三角、如今明囤胄不衰、則後市尙有步站之可能云、</p>
<p>國米來源、共到河下四號、輪車包子二千餘包、時將夏曆年終、賣買變方大都從事結束、故昨本銷轉懈、囤戶停手、市上交易有限、結果市面因呈定局、若厚簿粳價高料者悉無榮辱、僅中段貨以價低銷廣、又加幾分至一角、杜洋尖埠尖跟粳市站定、變元高貨仍開十五元、不過交次者眼光又見帶落角許、聞米業市塲營業、准自十四日起從事結束休業、故自今日始祗有四天、將於明春紅盤再開、故在此數日內市面、或無多大變化矣、</p>
<h3>麵粉南洋去路　依然不衰　萬餘包今日運汕</h3>
<p>昨粉市趨勢、由穩而堅、緣近日客銷尙佳、南洋帮零星去化、反比北洋帮熱烈、蓋由於南洋方面洋麥進口依然徵稅、故申粉需要不衰、而北洋方面、則以當地洋粉傾銷、一時難望暢辦、廠方仍以現底缺乏、售意頗堅、一號粉廠盤、穩站於四元八角原盤、統市本衝交易、仍有八千包以上、南北兩帮各裝近萬包、下脚粉市面趨昂、尙無妥成交</p>
<p>今日有粉一萬四千二百包、運往汕頭、</p>
<h3>澳洲麵粉　亦有大批到滬高料麥價提升</h3>
<p>小麥市况、毫無特殊開展近日各地來源　落、昨自新港來五百包、滬市存底亦薄、在此存到兩少之際、而廠方以製粉原料、漸次充足、均擬待諸明年再辦、故市面早呈結束景象、統市售開江北高麥一種、額計一千三百包、由阜　廠辦去三百包、福新廠辦去一千句、價爲六元六角五分、比前又升五分、按目下各廠洋麥有到、均需要國產高麥之搭配、故高料價格提升、中次貨廠胃不食、市面仍平、</p>
<p>美麥源而來、迭誌本報、今悉澳粉、亦有大景運來、前日（八日）進口之大英公司經理之Janda且　號、自澳洲運來、麥粉二千噸、計五萬餘包、該項麥粉、前雖常有裝來、但從無此次之多云、</p>
<h3>紗花　靜待結束中之紗布　囤戶逢跌仍在拖進實銷生意沉寂如故</h3>
<p>紗市轉趨淸澹、蓋以時屆歲闌人靜之際、各方忙於結束、無心營業、因此交易沉寂不堪、客方因年內行駛船隻、來往航班不多、於是對於辦貨一層、亦束手須待明春新正、再行發展、至於囤戶方面、連朝吃進、爲額已屬可觀、目前意態稍疎懈、亦不急乎搜羅、然價格下跌時仍來塌便宜貨、故二十支雙馬跌破四百元關口、某某復來吸進、迨至收盤轉緊、重出四百元關外矣、</p>
<p>售價跌二三元不一</p>
<p>現紗市塲、晨初開盤、因實需交易較少、客帮無電到滬、委託又缺、人氣渙散、雙方相延甚久、才做開行市、二十支雙馬開價比十日跌二元、爲四百〇一元半、同行成交三十包、汕頭帮進天女三十包、僧爲四百〇一元、此後現貨生意依然呆滯如故、浮多賣意又鬆、尤軟一步、跌進四百元關口但小囤戶鑒於價廉父來拖進、又復回出關外、結果上午成交統計五百三十七包、實際客銷成交僅二百句未滿、行情二十支雙馬比上日收盤價跌三元、特金城跌二元、天女跌二元半、雙地球跌三元、十支粗紗尙平、廣方未聞有何舉動、今日有紗　千七百七十件運汕頭、八十　運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行三六〇　汕頭四〇　內地五七溫州七八　寗波七　厦門五合計五三七</p>
<p>紗業公會停市有期</p>
<p>棉紗同業公會現紗市塲、茲議定於二月十七日起停市、至二月二十三日再照常開市營業、並恢復午後交易、集會改做全日營業矣、</p>
<p>日紗需要岑寂下挫</p>
<p>日紗市塲異常清澹、集會者大見减少、蓋以年關已屆、各方已無納胃、故市價隨需要之岑寂、而下挫二三元、二十支水月現紗價爲三百二十七元、二十支籃鳳現紗價爲三百二十二元云、</p>
<h3>美棉近跌遠漲　本棉祇有二筆交易</h3>
<p>外棉市、紐約棉市、昨日較為鑒定、初因華爾街買進而漲、後因各紗廠深慮政府之貸款棉出售、市價必降、故又將前購之現貨及近期紛紛賣出、改拖遠期、因之昨日市價近期跌而遠期漲、紐約金融報估計今年棉田爲二五、三九一、〇〇〇英畝、較去年政府統計之二六、四四九、〇〇〇英畝、縮减一、〇五八、〇〇○英畝之巨、昨日滙兌於晨間一度放長、午後又縮、折合法幣、棉價俱跌、計美棉及巴西棉每担跌三角、印棉跌二角、埃及棉每祖跌八角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、仍屬沉悶異常、唯各廠均乘此淸閒之時、向各洋行索取各種棉樣、作品質之分析、及價格之比較等工作、以作紅盤購棉時之參考、昨日交易靜寂、茲將昨日棉價錄後、</p>

<h3>公債分期還本付息手續</h3>
<p>二十八年一月三十一日到期之統一公債第六期本息，業經政府明白規定在重慶付款，而上海方面則分六期領取現款，發給准滬憑證。本報爲便利讀者起見，特將領取手續調査如下：</p>
<p>領取手續實際頗爲簡單，先向中央銀行素取「公債還本付息應領准滙憑證申請書一逐項塡寫後，連同公債本息票交與中央銀行團庫局。中央銀行收到此項申請書與本息票經核算無誤後，即給予臨時收據一紙，並先行墊付六分之一。債券本息票持有人收到此項臨時收據後，異日即憑此收據換取財部之准滙憑證，每月向中央銀行領取六分之一之金額。</p>
<p>惟塡寫申請書類爲繁瑣，茲加銓釋如次：例如讀者持有統丙公債百元票二十張，每張應領之息金爲三元。於是在「公債名稱種塡「統丙，」「期數」　塡「六，」「本息票每張應領金額」欄塡「三元，」「張數」欄塡「二十，」「金額」欄塡「六十元，」「本票應扣缺息或息票應扣所得稅欄塡「三元」「因　60XX　　「應付國幣」攔塡「五十七元」因　60——　3　　57。</p>
<p>此係最簡單之情形。若讀者持有統一公債不止統丙一種，且票面不僅百元一種時，則應分別統甲，統乙，統丙，統丁，統戊而依次塡寫。至「本息票每張應領金額」一欄，票面十元者塡「三角，「百元者塡「三元，」千元者塡「三十元，」五千元者塡「一百五十元。」</p>
<p>若讀者持有之統一公債，已經中籤，則在「本息蔡每張應領金額」欄內塡入票面額，而在「本票應扣缺息或息票應扣所得稅」欄內則不塡。中籤票上附有第六期之息票，則與其他同類同額之息票合併塡寫一行。但若前期中籤債票在本期領取時，則因第六期之息票或被取巧剪去，此時應計算其被剪去各期息票之總金額而塡入「本票應扣缺息或息票應扣所得稅」欄內。</p>
<p>茲更以仁大銀號所持有二十八年一月三十一日到期之公債本息爲例，以供讀者參考，設該號所有公價本息票如下：</p>
<p>中籤公債本息票計一，統甲百元十張，千元票二張。二，統乙十元票五張，五千元票二張。</p>
<p>息票方面計一，統甲三角者三十張，三元者二十（連中籤息要共計三十，）三十元者十張（連中籤票共計十二，）一百五十元者三張。二，統乙三角者四十張（連中籤票共計四十五，）三元者二十五張，三十元者十五張，一百五十元者五張（連中籤息票共計七號。）</p>
<p>又三元息票計統丙五十張，統丁一百張，統戊二十五張。</p>
<p>其申請書塡寫形式，當如下所示：</p>
<p>公債期</p>
<p>名稱數</p>
<p>本息票每</p>
<p>張應領金</p>
<p>張數金額（元）</p>
<p>本票應扣缺息或息票應扣所得稅應付國幣（元）</p>
<p>中央銀行收到申請書後經核算無誤，當即給予現軟二千六百五十三元五角六分，而另給以臨時收據一紙，其式如下所示</p>
<p>註：「應付第一期憑票款」下與「上海中央銀行」</p>
<p>右均有中央銀行負責人員之簽章。</p>
<p>仁大銀號收到此臨時收據後，將來即憑此掉換准滙憑證，而憑證按月向中央銀行領取六份之一之金額。</p>
<p>至有准匯憑證之格式，聞大致與公債息票相類而係按月剪去者，截至現在止，此項准滙憑證尙未發出。</p>
<p>關於零星小額如三角或三元息票之取款，目前尙未發生，蓋息票持有人决不致爲此區區小數而貼去來回多次之車錢與辦理此繁瑣之手續，大多售與小錢莊或　號也。</p>
<h3>油餅　遠期豆油成交不多　生油市况轉緊油豆進出均有</h3>
<p>豆油市况、因年關轉匯將屆、買賣均少興會、而昨更有洋行兜售遠期貨、雖成交不多、而市氣已呈軟勢、計成交三月下期二百桶價二十八元一角半、訂月底交亦開二十八元一角半、成交一百五十桶、二三天交先開二十八元一角半、五十桶、入後即甩至二十七元九角半、成交亦祇五十桶、現油共開百餘桶、價分二十八元二角及二十八元、</p>
<p>花生油因聞靑島有禁運出口之說、故市態由定轉緊、但其波浪尙少、出於某方變幻手段、故尙難樂觀、昨計與化帮續辦靑島聽油二百聽、價爲原盤三十元零五角、本街問津膠州簍油二百件、價爲二十一元四角、比上日漲二角、路貨成交百件、價二十一元、</p>
<p>豆油昨有一百五十件自烟台來、今日有生油五百件運香港、</p>
<p>又豆子昨自新港來二百包、今日亦有七百包運汕頭、</p>
<h3>糖市　明華日糖　已有人為之包銷利之所在竟忘義</h3>
<p>新潮糖今明有五千包到滬</p>
<p>昨糖市無甚更動、公會劃盤、以及號盤、均僅小數交易而已、據汕頭帮消息、新潮糖靑赤白、俱有裝出在途、計太古公司之慶元輪、共約五千外包、預計今明日必可進口、新刁青因甌市較佳、故大都均運往該處應銷、是以到申者寥寥、又傳明華日糖廠之出品、已有人爲之包銷可見商人圖利、固無所不用其極、但此則宜稍有辨別、須知多購一些X貨、即减少自己若干力量、未免見利忘義、太無民族意識、爲此者其將自絕於國人</p>

<h3>知識青年的出路</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>本來，我國壯丁很多，兵源根本不成問題，用不著知識青年荷槍加入行伍，所以宋美齡女士最近曾發表一文，說學生在戰時只要直接或間接去喚醒國人的抗戰意識，並且改進民衆生活，也就夠了。</p>
<p>然而這話，是宋女士愛護知識青年之意，也就是說，知識青年報國之途，有更甚於當兵的地方，並不是說他們絕對不須當兵。所以我們假使將她的說話，和蔣委員長前日勸黨政人員子弟踴躍從軍的通令，合而觀之，就可以發見牠們的用意，正復相同：每一個知識青年，都應該負起救國的責任，或上前綫打仗，或在後方從事救國運動。</p>
<p>黨政人員子弟，當然都是知識青年。抗戰以來，雖然像蔣經國的領兵打仗，馮副委員牠的大公子戰死南苑，足以爲這些子弟的表率，而其他醉生夢死，或者燕居享樂的，一定還是多數。蔣委員牠要他們一概入伍，非但爲人民樹立榜樣，也因此而增强抗戰的實力，實在爲知識青年清楚地指定了報國的另一個途徑。我們擁護這一個主張。</p>
<p>我想，每一個知識青年，能上前綫打仗的，就上前綫打仗，能在後方活動的，就在後方活動，實是他們現在應走的兩條路。讀書，用功讀收，在課外極盡可能之力，從事救國，當然也可以歸入後方活動的範圍內。知識青年珍重著吧，不要放棄了自己的責任。</p>
<p>不過在我個人的意見，知識青年與其在後方盡力，還不如上前綫盡力。因爲躲在後方，總不免有規避的嫌疑，要發生放棄責任的流弊。他們一上前綫，我想他們的影響，不論在前綫或後方，一定很大。蔣委員長的通令，也許正有些慨乎言之的意味在內吧！</p>
<h3>趕路（下）</h3>
<p>— 牆頭草</p>
<p>「看老子揍你！」不知誰發一聲喊，投過去一塊磚石，它們夾著尾巴嚇得一窠風地跑散了。</p>
<p>我們這三個俘虜偶然走在一堆。姓李的扁臉的小學敎員在發抖，他怕得厲害，自言自語地：</p>
<p>「我又不犯什麽罪，我一向是安安穩穩的，敎書爲的騙口飯吃吃，也是沒法子的苦惱事呀！」</p>
<p>說後，想獲得些安慰似的，看看我底臉色，但一見我若無其事的樣子，又失望地把眼光很迅速地避開。</p>
<p>「是嗎？我是不犯什麽罪的，局里一定不會把我解到××司令部去的吧？」他與我話不投機，便把　子伸向在他旁邊的米店學徒的耳上去。</p>
<p>米店學徒還不上二十歲，邨里人都呌他小祝。舉止看來還誠實：他不高興理睬那扁臉的小學敎員，只顧低聲下氣的向僞警們訴苦：</p>
<p>「先生們，我是做學徒的呀！你們想想我怎會去加入什麽游擊隊？並且我又是本地人，家里有田地房屋，還有父母兄弟，我怎好做這强盜般的營生呢？我很明白，這是大逆不道要砍頭的事呀！」</p>
<p>「這小東西可惡！」我咬著嘴唇。</p>
<p>「先生們，等歇到局裏面請幫幫忙，替我解釋解釋，我一定不會忘記諸位的，如果不放心的話，我的，如果不放心的話，我可以託人呌鎭長作保！」</p>
<p>小學敎員似乎也不甘落寞，枝梧地說著：</p>
<p>「我和他一樣的，不犯罪，有良民證；我也可以呌人作保！」</p>
<p>走在稍前些長個子的僞警不耐煩了，旋過頭來：</p>
<p>「包沒事的，你們到局里躭擱一下就可出來的。」</p>
<p>「先生們，看我的樣子還能像一個壞人嗎？」米店學徒一副苦笑的臉。</p>
<p>大家都向他看去：矮矮的身子，圓而且平的鼻尖，上額凸出，兩頰卻毫沒肉彩的收縮著，活像一隻猢猻。這副滑稽的相貌引得大家都發笑了；一方面似乎要打破沉寂似的，各人故意地把笑聲持續些時候。</p>
<p>後邊翹牙鬚發覺了，提高了嗓子斥責著：</p>
<p>「吵什麽啦？不准吵！」</p>
<p>細白麻子也跟著用同樣的口吻：</p>
<p>「夠了，還再笑什麽呢？」</p>
<p>其實等他出口時，什麽人早都不想笑了。</p>
<p>一沉默，有人又在埋怨起來：</p>
<p>「眞是活見鬼！大驚小怪的，說有什麽大隊的游擊隊在開秘密會議，裝上子彈呀，插上刺刀呀，哈，它媽的，就這麽三個！神色又不像是眞的！」</p>
<p>「起初我的腿也軟了，現在可好啦！」其中的一個像剛透過一口氣來似的。</p>
<p>「卻淋了這麽一身大的雨！」</p>
<p>天很快地暗了下來，邨莊，樹林，模糊地變成一個個猙獰的巨人。大家變得靜默起來，腳步搬得更快。米店學徒還在喃喃地訴苦，但誰也沒有理他。細白麻子提高著喉嚨催促著我：</p>
<p>「快走！快走！」</p>
<p>雨夜的空氣里迸裂著他粗暴的迴響。</p>
<h3>英相的三部曲</h3>
<h3>火</h3>
<p>— 瑩金</p>
<p>小孩子愛火，因爲火有一種神秘的原素；老頭子愛火，因爲火暫時替他們喚回了青春；年青人愛火，因爲火充滿著蓬勃的生氣，有光，有力，有熱。</p>
<p>我是青年，和別的青年們一樣，我也愛火。</p>
<p>不過我之愛火，還有止這一些。</p>
<p>火雖然能燬滅，但卻是新生的啟示；雖然能焚燒，但卻是建築的必需；雖然能將美麗的城市化爲焦土，但也能在焦土上築起崇高自由的樂園！</p>
<p>還有：無形的怒火，也能發出偉大的力量，燒去人類中一切懷疑與卑鄙的渣滓。</p>
<p>火是偉大的，是神聖不可侵犯的！</p>
<p>於是，我更愛火。</p>

<h3>有殘疾的人</h3>
<p>— 君佩</p>
<p>有一句俗話：「瞎毒　　刁，啞子肚裏一把刀！」這是說，有殘疾的人，存心最爲險惡，最好我們不要惹他，假使惹著了他，或者他竟來惹著了你，你就該好好地防他，不要著了他的「毒」，「刁」，或「一把刀」。</p>
<p>爲什麽有殘疾的人會這樣呢？這也無非他們有了缺陷，怨天尤人，內不自安，久而久之，就蘊成了惡念：一則怨恨自己偏生有殘疾，無可掩盡，一則妒忌他人，偏生好端端地現在他的眼前，滿肚皮的牢騷不平之氣，只恨沒有個發洩處；要是誰，不論有意或無意，提到了他的一些缺陷，他自然要老羞成怒，果然要怒從心上起，惡向膽邊生了！</p>
<p>總而言之，由畸形的身體，養成了變態的心理。其實有了殘疾的人，根本用不著掩飾，更不必自怨自艾，尤不必惱恨他人，欲得而甘心。只要用得其長，將自己特長的本能發展出來，一樣也可以建功立業，大有作爲，使人忘去他的短處。而每一個人又本來總有某種的特長的。遠的不必說，例如戈倍爾斯是個跛子，就做了德國的宣傳部長，愛維先珂是個盲人，就成了世界著名的詩人。否則「麻子搽粉，蝕煞老本」；大腳裝小腳，小腳裝大腳，不但不見其美，適見其肉麻之醜；而紅眉毛，綠眼睛，張開血盆大口，只想吃人，總有一天，犯了衆怒，一頓亂棒打煞。</p>
<p>無奈今之畸形的身體，專會養成變態的心理，而變態的心理，專會發出瘋狂的行動。並且，這種瘋狂的行動施之於一人，一事，爲害還小，而今之瘋狂的行動，卻又往往施之於一國，一民族，爲害之大，眞是無可比擬。這眞是要呌人頓足扼腕，而大呼無可奈何的！你不信麽？聽我道來：</p>
<p>據說，拿破崙的窮兵黷武，就因爲肚皮上生了無法治愈的無出癬，夜裏睡不著覺，得不著與國公主的歡心，所以鋌而走險的。黃巢的顚覆唐室，殺人八百萬，就因爲上京赴試，生得醜陋不堪，得不到狀元，所以憤而造反的。</p>
<p>現在也有這種人。據說，——沒奈何，只好用據說，某一個掌大權者，爲了是個天閱，終身近不得女人，心頭鬱結，養成了怪僻的脾氣，所以做出來的事情，例如趕人動身之類，大都陰賊險狠，不近「人道」。又一個掌大權者，正合著「頭大腳細，養煞勿趣」的條件，而一個下巴翹起來，正像一個瓦片餅，大可以和朱洪武媲美，自小就爲人看不起來，受盡了許多怨氣，一朝得法，就明搶暗奪，欺騙硬敲起來。最後還有一個掌大權者，是個「三寸丁，毅樹皮」，素來就沒有給人放在眼裏。於是他處處高攀，力爭上游，結果雖然掙得了一些面子，還是心不滿足，就不惜倒行逆施，殘害生靈，妄想達到他那「跌金剛」的目的。</p>
<p>這三個人，三個有殘疾的人，據說正在風頭上，大有不可一世，惟我獨尊之概。然而我們可以預料，他們的結果，決不會勝過拿破崙或黃</p>
<p>爲他們瘋狂的行動，正和拿破崙與黃巢差不得。</p>
<p>外國人也一句俗話：「健全的精神，寓於健全的體格。「這也很可以反證體格上有殘疾的人，心理上是不健全的。我們一方面力求自己的一方面力防有殘疾的人吧！</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>這時，外面天井裏忽然發出一陣急促的跑步聲，一個勤務兵氣喘喘的直闖進房來，迎著葉團長，就雙腳立正，行了個軍禮。</p>
<p>『報告團長……』</p>
<p>葉團長臉色一變，疾忙跑起身來問道：</p>
<p>『前方怎樣了？』</p>
<p>『報告團長，石湖蕩已經失陷，敵人正在撲攻楓涇嘉善，離開我們的防區已經很近了。』</p>
<p>『那你趕快回去對梁團附趙營長說，不要單是防守，從速先佔陣地，選擇有利的地形，和敵人作戰，盡力阻住牠們，不要讓牠他們衝過來。知道了嗎？』</p>
<p>『知道了！』勤務兵應了一聲，回頭就跑。還沒有跑出天井，葉團長又在背後喊住他說：</p>
<p>『記住，東北兩面要特別警戒。你對他們說，我馬上就來。』</p>
<p>葉團長怱怱進房收拾了一下，把公事皮包挾在腋下，便向房裏所有的人揮手作別說：</p>
<p>『我去了，你們不要慌，這里一時大概不要緊的。』</p>
<p>『方俊，你在前方當心些，戰事結束了就回來。』葉太太的聲音有些哽咽了，眼裏含著兩包清淚。</p>
<p>葉團長微微一笑，好像笑他母親的沒有見識，怎麼在這戰事剛剛開始的時候，就盼望結束。但同時他也體會到這是慈母的愛子之心，他深切的被感動了，臉色很快的陰沉了下來。</p>
<p>方英和方慧又把他大哥的臂膀抓住了。</p>
<p>『大哥，你現在就同我們到前方去好嗎？』</p>
<p>『不行，我現在要跑步上前綫，你們跑不快的。』葉團長厭煩地摔脫他弟妹說。</p>
<p>『我跑得快，上次縣中運動會賽跑我就得第一，不信我們來試試看。』方英誇耀地說。</p>
<p>『你跑得快也不中用，現在前方軍情緊急，我要指揮戰事，沒工夫安插你們；還是請你們等一些時候，只要有了機會，我自會派人來同你們的。』</p>
<p>『方英，不要纏你大哥。』葉老先生也在一旁呵喝了，一壁揮手對葉團長說：『你去罷，免得躭誤了軍事。』</p>
<p>葉團長答應了一聲，便像一陣旋風似的跑了出去。（九）</p>

<h3>婚後男子犯有陷病而諱疾的危機！</h3>
<p>善欲人見不是眞善，惡恐人知便是大惡，犯有隱病而諱疾，必終成惡疾，諱疾是中國人的通病，尤其是犯有隱病，就鬼鬼祟祟的保守著秘密，絕對不肯告人，甚至連他的妻子都不使知道。偶一爲他妻子或旁人看穿了，猶以「君子不好此道」或是「修身養性」等的一套鬼話來騙人。還有一種人，將隱病染給了妻子，反說妻子染給了他，那就更人格掃地了。</p>
<p>什麽叫做隱病？這在聰明的人不待說明就可以知道。何以在今日社會上男子獨多此種隱病，據醫家的論斷，一半是因爲社會道德低落日趨於色情之一途；一半是由於青年人世故未深，意志薄弱，一經引誘淫無度，多妻縱慾，使性機能斷傷生殖腺液枯竭。則凡遺精滑精，腎虧無能，精力渙散，久婚不育，神經衰弱等症，即相繼而起，那不特在夫婦間正常的性生活上不能滿足，使妻痛恨，致夫婦間的愛情上發生了裂痕，這種裂痕如不即速的加以彌補，那裂痕愈裂愈大，好像地球的拆裂一樣，可以毀滅一切！所以夫婦間由此仳離或家庭破壞者是常有的事！此外因諱疾不醫，或醫而不能澈底，使病態加重，爆發腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，全體虛弱疲憊，那不特終日困頓在憂鬱與痛苦之中，百事無成，了無生趣，且將形成早衰與早殘殤，其危險爲何似！</p>
<p>所謂「有病自得知」，一待自己發覺了疾病，未婚而有父母者，須及早告知父母，請求給費延醫診治，或服葉自療，已婚而自立者，須與妻子或好友商量，務求最對症而特效的療法，否則病急亂投醫與亂服藥也是非常危險的，因爲市上的庸醫或類似的藥物充斥，能誤服春藥，雖或一時興奮，而機能的受損益甚，如服症下藥之效，而病症遷延愈久，病根就愈加深入，這是不可不深切注意的。據世界名醫及余多年經騐，對於上述病症，均公認服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最爲對症而特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，使病症減輕，如繼續服用，必可於短期內完全恢復健康。若長期服用，可使身體倍增强健，收返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，收效更可迅速；但患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等各種塗學療法，必可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>遺精不可忽視！</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>遺精一症，在症勢上講，牠是比較各種急症來得和綏多了，但在健康與幸福上講，卻又比各種急症來得痛苦多多。因爲急症如傷寒，猩紅熱，腦膜炎，盲腸炎等來勢固然猛烈，患之者輒有性命之虞！可是如果能夠治療得法，那在數天之內，即能化險爲夷，受不到多少苦痛，至於遺精症呢？這就大不然了，牠這種突如其來的猛烈情形，雖然比較絕無僅有，可是牠損害患者的健康，與剝削青年的幸福，這是無論那種急慢症所沒有牠這樣的厲害的。</p>
<p>牠的最顯著的症象，患者輒有頭暈腦脹，腰　背痛，耳鳴心悸，記憶薄弱，怕煩好靜，無剛毅果敢的精神，遇事畏縮不前，思想不能集中，判斷力與記憶力漸次消滅，如屬於弄弄筆桿兒的朋友，則文思每感枯澀，終日精神萎頓，意興蕭索，然此數者，還是最普通的一般症象，如果患者平時本有自瀆惡癖，或遺洩過頻而猶放任不治者，則其結果的悲慘！更不堪言！</p>
<p>蓋精液是一種繁榮全身的主要腺液，而自瀆卻是斷傷性腺，摧毀精關的惡劣舉動，如果累犯而成了習慣，則精關鬆弛，遺精滑精等症必然相繼爆發，遂影響及於性神經，而有發育不全，局部短小，陰萎早洩等各種症象，此種患者，在表面上看來，他們固然飯也吃得下，屎也拉得出，可是他們內心里的痛苦，那眞非局外人所得而知了！</p>
<p>關於本症的有效療法，那在醫藥澀度昌明的今日，也並不困難，祗要患者堅壹意志，戒絕自瀆，服以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，使青春腺重獲繁榮，則新陳瓦謝的機能亢進，內分泌不斷產生，一切衰弱症象，自然統歸消滅，惟服藥前本有遺精滑精者，那須同時以『希米脫氏固精片』鞏固其精關，則漏　既塞，滋補之效可彰。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯發育與女性健美</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>促進乳峯發育是造成女性健美的唯一秘訣</p>
<p>在生理成熟，發育健全的狀態下，每個年輕女郎，都應該有嬝娜而健美的姿態。這種姿態包括有苗條的身體，顯明的曲線，而尤其是在胸前呈雙峯並峙式的高聳的乳峯。至於面部有著白嫩而紅潤的皮膚，活潑而有神情的眼珠，烏黑而如雲朶的頭髪，笑容可掬的面部全副表情……那當然也是很重要的。在前我們評點一個婦女的美醜，完全只著重面部，這是絕對錯誤的！因爲面部只居全身的一個小部分，健全的美人除面部的秀麗之外更須相稱於健美的體格的。因此，凡發育不良乳痛顏衰的婦女莫再多費心力於妳門的面部了。妳們必得從根本上努力，就是多省些脂粉之資，來速即購服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，則不特可促進發育機能使乳峯聳起，並可助牠新陳瓦謝作用使皮膚新鮮而紅潤，則體態與面容可以俱震懾美麗；就是凡有月經不調，白帶，不感，不娠等的暗疾，憂得根本治愈，生育有望，女界得此良藥，則健美有術，百病無憂。所以此藥早已風行全球，譽滿天下，各藥房均售了。</p>

<h3>白濁爲什麽難愈？</h3>
<p>僅服市售成藥　當然難愈！</p>
<p>僅憑膚淺的醫療　尤其難愈！</p>
<p>僅服成藥之不可靠　社會上最普遍而最難愈的惡症，一般都以爲是花柳病中的白濁，其實白濁並不難愈，而所以難愈者，實由患者當感染之初，尿道灼熱，心便頻繁，膿液流出，局部紅腫，此際因急於求治，往往不暇細擇，只憑報上煌煌之廣告，買一二盒市售成藥，私自吞服，初時病勢果覺稍減，便以爲可以高枕無憂，豈知已鑄大錯，淋毒菌潛入後尿道，漸次於睾丸，精囊，攝護腺等處，大肆活動，從此根深蒂固，成爲慢性淋病，這是一般病人極易犯的弊病！</p>
<p>膚淺醫療之不可靠　其次關於醫療上之失不發，也是促成本症難愈的主要原因，近來科學日見昌明，醫療器械，亦日見完備，可是一般市醫仍墨守十年前舊法，以極簡陋之器械，對客臨診，便侈談經騐宏富，甚目僅做表面工作，敷衍了事，如此而欲白濁速愈，不亦難哉？本醫師臨診十餘年，對於淋病之治療方法，除置備最新式超短波電療機，牠波電療機，尿道檢查鏡，膀胱反射鏡，及確具實效之針藥外，更高價購置，『德國濾淋平流電療機』爲滬上治淋界放一異彩，無論新老折濁，來所求診者，本醫　師咸悉心體察病菌何在，分別加以治療，自信如此負責，如此用藥，白濁誠有何難愈哉？</p>

<h3>支那蘋菓</h3>
<p>— （戈兒）</p>
<p>我們的「友邦」，過去在敎育他們的小學生的時候，常常把「支那蘋菓」去誘惑他們，向他們宣說：要吃「支那蘋菓」，必須要「征服支那」方行。——這是我在當小學生的時候，我們的老師常常吿訴我們的一個故事，這意思，是要我們小學生要保護我們的「蘋菜」，勿使人家來侵佔！</p>
<p>現在我的年紀已經有二十幾歲了，在我們的「友邦」，那些「小學生」，當然也已是到了和我相仿的年齡了，而他們現在，也正在實行他們老師平日的「敎育」，到我們中國來吃「支那蘋菓」了。</p>
<p>然而他們有沒有「吃到」了呢？</p>
<p>回答是非常使他們失望的：那是——沒有吃到，或者，有的「吃到」了，然而，那是不會長久的。因其如此，所以他們是吃的非常的匆迫的，他們在這樣「狼呑虎嚥」的時侯，當然不會想起我們中國的一個民間故事，那就是貪心的蛙，把肚皮也吃破了的故事。</p>
<p>不過，雖然是「吃到」了，而吃得又那麽匆迫，然而，「吃」的究竟是「少數」之「少數人」！「大多數」的人非但沒有「吃到」，却反爲了那些少數的「貪心的蛙」而喪失了生命！因此，那些尙未喪失生命的「上當者」，（我只能說「上當者」，其實，也名符其實的「上當者」呀！）他們對童時老師敎授他們的「敎育」，懷疑起來了：「支那蘋菓」是不會給我們「吃到」的，我們所「吃到」的，原來是「支那子彈」呀！而那些在吃「支那蘋菓」的，不是蹲在我們無數的被欺騙的「貪饞者」的屍身上面在吃麽？並且，又吃得那麽匆迫，那麽貪狂，不管自己的肚子的容量怎樣，老是「吃着」，「吃着」。……是的，他們也看到那些「少數者」的「吃」的結果，還是沒有「吃」，因爲「吃」破了肚皮，與「蘋菓」是毫無損害的！</p>
<p>於是，報紙上有這樣的新聞出現了。</p>
<p>第一則：「日反戰情緒高漲，侵華軍隊中設有小組，大沽曾一度發生譁變」。……</p>
<p>第二則：「南市日海軍造船廠，滿貼反戰標語，因發現此項情事，連日大事檢舉思想，故多數日籍工人，皆被調往前綫」。……</p>
<p>第三則：「日人來滬謀生，空懷奢望，結果獲得職業者非常之少，就紛紛去向日本居留民恊會之職業介紹部申請，因此害得居留民會應付爲難了」！……</p>
<p>够了！够了！像上述這樣的新聞，自八·一三來，如果要摘錄，是可以集成爲册的，然而够了！我們只要「挺」下去，貪心的蛙的肚皮，總有一天會吃破的！</p>
<p>來件</p>
<h3>書法與環境（上）</h3>
<p>— 李肖白</p>
<p>書法之環境。其包含甚廣。　「人」的方面。　「物」的方面。　時的方面。人的環境　第一要家庭間父若兄。要明白書法。（學校敎育另文討論。）因爲書法這件事。最需要的。是方法和途徑。方法怎樣可以探求。途徑怎樣可以尋得。那麽非靠相當指導者加以指導不可。父若兄假使明白書法。那麽子弟對於書法方面。執筆應當怎樣。佈置環境。應當怎樣。選擇碑帖。應先從何種着手。進而上之。應取之途徑怎樣。缺點何在。應該怎樣加以改革。優點何在。應如何加以獎勵。自有相當的方法。分別設施。這就是俗語所說「家學淵源」。家學有了淵源。再加以名師之薰陶。良友之切磋。雖不能成爲大家。至少限度。可入於軌道。所以「良冶之子。恒爲良冶。良裘之子。恒爲良裘」。善書者之子。恒爲善書者。像王義之獻之父子和歐陽詢歐陽通父子。就是一個極明顯的例子。而農工商之子弟。對於書法。往往不能出類拔萃者。即由於父若兄。對於書法。根本沒有研究。這樣說來。父兄之擅長書法與否。和書法之優劣。豈非有莫大的關係麽。第二要得良師。師者。所以授業解惑者也。是以吾人欲求學業之進步。非賴有名師指導不爲功。遠者如鍾繇之傳衛夫人。衛夫人之授王義之。近者如民元至民五。江蘇省立第一師範學校。由在克塘先生主待指導書法。第二師範。由吳量遮先生主持指導書法。第二師範由華綰言黃淡如二先生主持指運十書法。當時三校師範生。靡然從風。人才輩出。迫出而任敎。莫不應付裕如。而若輩所栽培之小學生。亦莫不有相當之程度。就筆者而論。家世業商。固無家學之可言。蒙宣時。就學私塾。塾師所指導者。爲描紅映寫和臨帖。而筆者所臨之帖。爲購自書攤之黃自元書帖。熟師不加可否。聽其自然。迨入小學。敎師之書法程度較高。但主觀太深。以本人之得力於歐陽詢九成宮。遂以九成宮一帖。爲書法之鵠的。而學者之筆性如何。不問也。設學者改習它帖。則絕對不許。懸爲厲禁。而筆者之筆性和九成宮。却扦格不相入。說也笑話。愈用功。反愈覺退步。迨入師範。書法敎師。所奉爲天經地義者。楷書爲玄秘塔。行書爲蘭亭序。中間雖略有進步。卒以執筆之茫無把握。致時作時輟。因循數戰。出而忝任敎師。本不敢對於書法。有所希冀。故碑帖即置之高閣。不料民五年執敎梁溪。因同事之擅長書法。揮洒自如者。不乏其人。不覺慚愧。不得不深自策勉。値太夫子嚴堯卿先生。時相過從。茶後酒餘。輒以書法相叩。經其指示送徑。復贈以碑帖。茅塞頓開。堯卿先生。爲錫北名士。既承垂靑。安敢不奮勵有加。遂毅然痛改前非。一遵堯卿先生之方針。每於夜深人靜之時。則伸紙濡毫。練習兩小時。未及一年。成效大著。是爲余之環境轉變時代。迄今稍有成就。飲水思源。實不能不歸功於堯卿先生。設當時不遇堯卿先生。則暗中摸索。東拉西扯。漫無標的。雖有認眞練習之心。但無適當之方法。和適當之途徑。安能有所成乎。此所以在求學時期。名師實不可少也。第二要有益友。「愚者千慮。必有一得。智者千慮。必有一失。」所以智識豐富之友人。固足益我。即智識欠缺之友人。亦有千慮一得之處。足以補助我之學識。關於書法亦然。席談之間。往往可得一知半解。像較近李梅養和曾慶髯。在北平時。食必同桌。寢共衾席。出必同車。凡日常所切磋者。無非書法。採購之書籍。無非碎帖。碑帖既得。則反覆探求。反覆討論。因之上湧殷周。下逮明淸。莫不瞭如指掌。結果分南北二派。各樹一幟。發前人所未發。爲書法界放一異彩。這就是習書必良友的一個明證。余嘗謂良友有時勝於良師。即指此也。假使曾不友李。其所造恐未必有如此之深。而天下之有曾若李之書法天才者。恐不知凡幾。而以無良友切磋之故。致所造有限。甚至毫無成就。可不惜乎。良友和書法。關係顧不大哉。</p>
<h3>聖俠除奸</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“The　Saint　in　Ｎew　York”</p>
<p>雷電華公司出品　大上海戲院映</p>
<p>我們曾經看過很多G_Men的影片。偵探和盜匪的格鬥，機關槍的掃射，當這些緊張的塲面在銀幕上映出的時候，果然是給予化了七毛錢的觀衆，極大的滿足，而像愛德華魯賓遜那樣的人物，也深深地印在觀衆的腦膜上了，但是每個觀衆也忽略了金元國家繁榮背面所潛伏著的危機，雖然他們是利用這種電影來作爲「安定社會」的表示，然而擒了一個盜匪，破了一個盜窟，是否「社會」就「安定」了呢？這種「欲蓋彌彰」的「表示」當然是適得其反的</p>
<p>「聖俠除奸」雖然和那些G-Men電影微有不同之處，它是寫一個「英雄」怎樣從容不迫的去破獲匪黨，這寫法却比前者似乎更聰明些，因為那位「英雄」不但是「勇敢矯健」，而且還是「調情勝手」。譬如也在同一戲院映過的「巴黎獨行俠」，佛倫錫斯李德勒和現在的魯易斯海華就同樣風流瀟灑，——以這種姿態來肅奸匪黨，也自然比殺人不眨眼的偵探更使觀衆同情。然而結果呢？這「表示」還是失敗的，如「聖俠除奸」就吿訴觀衆，那匪黨首領竟是「市民公安維持會主席」。不過話也得說回來，這位「市民公安維持會主席」瓦克羅斯的被殺，它是說明了「盜匪如麻」的一部份原因，「安定社會」果然是要這「社會」的「改變」來决定，但把「市民公安維持會主席」類似的人物來漏一漏臉，也是不無小補的。</p>
<p>「聖俠除奸」據說是一部最近流行的偵探小說，作者是李斯廉却脫立斯，而且還是現代神秘小說家的權威。所以這位「聖俠」西門鄧伯拉也是非常「神秘」的了，如他赤手空拳，直入賭窟等等，眞是偵探小說中才有的人物。</p>
<p>西門槍殺埃波爾，導演者介紹他的第一功是很好的：埃波爾飲彈以後，街人圍了攏來，在人羣中一個黑衣的修道士在視察死者，最後他像很悲哀的離開了，這位祇看見他背影的修道士，在下一塲中就看到西門和瓦克羅斯，而西門剛在脫去衣服；及西門被海米及勒德擒獲時，在熄燈格鬥後，他越窗而出，但是底下黨徒已聞聲搜視，西門就爬上屋頂，這些地方，導演者是相當聰明的。</p>
<p>魯易斯海華很能演戲，他的眉毛，眼睛及兩頰的肌肉都有表情。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第三回　仰遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生</p>
<p>他們正在談話時，忽聽鄰桌上有人喚道：『澹雲姊！澹雲姊！』金澹雲回頭看時，却認得是同學吳君素女士。便問：『怎麽你在上海呀！』吳君素道：『是昨天來的，明天就要回去了，因此也沒有功夫來看你。』金澹雲望過去，有三四位女伴，同在一起。也有認識的，也有不認識的。原來這位吳君素女士，也是金澹雲的舊同學，她現任蘇州東吳大學校的敎授，原是一位文學家。因爲她的家裏住在上海，所以每逢星期日，常常是到上海來的。在從前同學的時候，她和金澹雲最是莫逆，因此她便走了過來。林建成她原是見過的，只這何家兩位小姐，不曾見過。金澹雲不免給兩方面介紹了一下，又問：『你明天回去，是什麽時候回去？』吳君素道：『上午就要回去。因爲我下午學校裏還有課咧。』金澹雲道：『那就很好了。這兩位何家姊姊，她們明天也要到蘇州去，你們正可同行。這兩位姊姊，初次到上海來，也沒有到蘇州各地游歷過。本來我想陪了她們去游玩游玩，無奈我爲職務所屬。君素姊！你明天乘幾點鐘的火車去？倘然你和她們同行，可以沿途指點她們以江南風景，這是再好也沒有了。」吳君素道·『我是乘上午九點鐘的快車，倘然兩位姊姊也搭這班火車行，我們車上就有伴了。澹雲姊！你放心！我今天權做一位嚮導員，代你的責任。到了蘇州，我可以陪着兩位姊姊，到各處看看。就不過我下午還有兩個鐘頭的課哪。』金澹雲道：『陪她們游玩倒不必，我知道你也很忙的。况且她們經過蘇州，就要到自由村去的，她們約定了的，也許朱愛人要到蘇州來接她們咧。』吳君素道：『喔！就是那位朱愛人女醫師嗎？我也是認得的。她曾經由我們學校裹請她來演講過的，講那兒童衛生常識，非常明瞭。那末這樣吧！倘然朱醫師來了，那就很好；朱醫師不來呢？我就招呼送兩位姊姊到自由村去便了。』何家兩位小姐很謝她的盛意，准定明天也乘上午力點鐘　快車動身。臨利時，她們又說『如此，明天車子上相會吧！』（三五）</p>

<h3>孤島菊話</h3>
<p>— 王唯我</p>
<p>——從幸與不幸說起——</p>
<p>唱戲的也有幸與不幸，周信芳（麒麟寶）憑他一條啞嗓子，竟然紅到這樣地步，雖然信芳的成名，不是僥倖而來，可是宰與不宰，不無關係。</p>
<p>早年上海灘能賣錢的角兒，不僅周信芳一個，白玉崑，楊瑞亭，蓋呌天，趙君玉輩，都曾經紅得發紫過的。直到現在呢，白玉崑趙君玉遠走外埠，悶不得志；楊瑞亭幾淪爲二等角色，蓋呌天雖然雄姿不減當年，可惜大舞台的一跌，終久影響了他的技能，和他全盛時代相較又有今昔之感了。惟獨信芳，能一天比一天唱得起勁，而穩坐了江南伶人的和經一把交椅，這又不能說不是幸與不幸了。</p>
<p>拿上述的幾個人說，趙君玉是捨之不論，白玉崑楊瑞亭蓋呌天都是正行武生，江南後起的一般武生，學來學去，總不外乎學他們三個人，（拏近十年在江南最享名的王虎辰高雪樵來說吧，王虎辰是學的白玉崑，高雪樵是學的蓋呌天），照理，這三個人成了典型人物，應當一輩子有了他們的飯，何以除蓋呌天，因爲歷史和環境的關係，尚能號召外，白玉崑楊瑞亭竟無人領呌呢，這裏有一個很有理解的答案：「物必自腐而後蟲生」。</p>
<p>白玉崑的槍，楊瑞亭的腿，在江南不做第二人想；可惜近年來，兩個人都犯了一個「懶」字的毛病，以致看白玉崑的戲，看不見白玉崑的槍；看楊瑞亭的戲，看不見楊瑞亭的腿；這樣怎能呌台下人滿意？唱戲的既不能滿意於台下人，還紅得了嗎？講到二人的藝術，都是文武不擋的第一流人才，白老九比較不幸，因爲不肯像楊瑞亭一樣屈就的關係，共舞台下來以後，就開碼頭到煙台去了。楊瑞亭呢，一二年來，始終沒有搭過長班子，現在聽說已經應聘共舞台了。楊老四進共舞台以後，或者在環境支配下，不讓那羣小輩英雄專美於前，而咬牙奮鬥一下，如果他的牙，能始終咬緊，或者幸運能因此而有轉機。</p>
<p>趙桐柵（芙蓉草）是伶人中幸運的一個，他雖然和四大名旦配戲，可是他能聽到和四大名旦差不多的包銀，其實這並不是桐楊的八字好，唯一的原因就是他演戲不懶，所以我敢很武斷的說，幸與不幸，和懶與不懶，是有極密切關係的。</p>
<p>試看林樹森吧！他在榮記大舞台時代，居裏子地位，戲碼有時尚在高雪樵前面，京角兒在大舞台唱戲，林樹森　零碎都唱，榮記大舞臺翻造，林老三在共舞臺掛三牌，和雲艷霞張如庭唱過一陣子，脫離共舞臺以後，有三年沒有在上海唱戲，前年和蓋呌天同臺出演於更新，竟然一變成成第一流紅角，這一半當然是樹林的努力，然而攷其究竟，還是在樹林之演戲認眞，樹林之玩藝兒，不及玉崑瑞亭，可是他不像他們那樣懶，所以現在的森樹森，能比白玉崑楊瑞亭值錢。</p>
<p>共舞臺有一個唱武生的王少樓，此君向在杭垣出演，來滬以後，因爲他的演戲「衝」，而紅了起來，無形中竟壓倒了，在上海有悠久歷史，紅底子的高雪樵，其實以藝術論，少樓久佔杭嘉湖，藝近於野，雪樵雖海，但究勝不和樓一籌，今少樓　之聲名，竟駕乎雪樵而上，這又不能說不是幸而不幸了。</p>
<h3>去年一年間香港電影公司出品略述（上）</h3>
<p>— 聶格自港寄</p>
<p>全面抗戰以後，香港因處化外，各方人口，避居此間者，日有增進，迄已陡加一倍以上，因之娛樂事業，更形發皇，電影一業，尤似雨後春荀。新起公司，爲數至夥，但大多投機取利，昧盡天良，所攝影片，內容非以香艷肉感號召，即取材於公子佳人一類的民間故事；香港士著居民智識程度，原甚低落，此種影片，正迎合彼等口味，輿論界雖大聲疾呼，製片家則充耳不聞。而香港法律特殊綦嚴，如對影片作嚴厲抨擊，雖屬名正言順，合乎至理，但一經製片家提出控訴，被告大多失敗，因此，執筆者不敢隨心所欲，大張撻伐，此亦香港電影不能改進之一因。雖然，合乎抗戰需要的愛國片，亦非全無，但十不得一耳。茲將容歲一年間香港各製片公司製片情形，略述如下，因限於篇幅，不克分析各片內容，故只列舉片名，而看了片名亦不難想像它的內容了：</p>
<p>南粵公司　該公司爲竺清賢所創辦，以自製的清賢式收音機收音，其成績，冠於港中各公司聲片，出品最受歡迎，去歲一年中攝製之片共十一部，爲「重見天日」，「七星伴月」，「風流財主」，「同胞兄弟」，「梅開二度」，「胭脂淚」（粵語拷貝，亦爲胡蝶主演，與國語同時攝製者），「梅知府」，「鬼域」（越語繫片，專在安南放映），「第八天堂」，「桃花將軍」，「奇女子」等，近在攝製「桃李爭春」爲薛覺生所主演。</p>
<p>南洋公司　該公司現由天一公司邵醉翁二弟邵邨人主持，爲去年香港製片公司產量最多之一家，計有「喜雙逢」，「龍城飛將」，「太平洋上的風雲」，「敗家子」，「拉車被辱」，「女人經」，「　碎靈芝」，「影壇風月」，「紫霞杯」，「女戰士」，「三娘汲水」，「六月飛霜」，「苦盡甘來」，「捨子奉姑」，「琵琶行」，「攝青鬼」，「叱咤風雲」，「夜光杯」，「銷魂大姐」，「柳曼鈴」，「口花花」等二十一部，攝製中新片有「風流地獄」，「摩登呆子」。</p>
<h3>游藝珍聞</h3>
<p>共舞臺武生王富英辭班，去志甚堅，該臺已邀妥近自青島返申之武生袁小樓，前晚付給定洋成局，昨晚起加入排戲。</p>
<p>卡爾登大戲院移風劇社定十一日撥發正月份包銀，並定十三日開始排練二本文素臣新戲，佈景綵頭，已在趕製中。</p>
<p>新世界游藝塲有定十日夜戲畢封箱訊。</p>
<p>大世界聯友社話劇，派定已卯年正月份劇目，預定演鴻運亨通，活財神，現代八仙，鬼等四部新戲，並將翻演名劇社秘夫人。</p>
<p>文武老生孫鵬志，擬脫離天蟾舞臺，明春過班卡德，但天蟾當局堅予挽留，不肯放手，刻尚在交涉中。坤旦金素雯定今晚時，假座大三星歡宴卡爾登大戲院當局周冀華，吳天厂，胡梯維等</p>
<h3>出演大羅天之花迎春</h3>
<h3>婦女問題劇上演</h3>
<p>上海業餘戲劇交誼社第四次公演定十二日上午十時，假座綠實劇塲，劇目爲「小丈夫」「醒悟」「三小姐的職業」等三劇，此三獨幕劇　以目前中國之婦女問題爲題材，由章泯，龔敏，尤競等先後寫成，劇情生動，均爲「苦來希格」</p>
<p>（一）「小丈夫」是寫舊式社會中「重男輕女」的惡習慣，以諷刺辛辣的筆調描寫舊社會中婦女們悲慘的遭遇。</p>
<p>（二）「醒悟」是寫一個女作家的生活，頗有易卜生「挪拉」的風味。</p>
<p>（三）「三小姐的職業」是以一個都會中常見的故事，提出目前婦女職業問題的嚴重性。</p>
<p>此次交誼社以最審愼的態度，最精細的排練來上演此三大「婦女問題」劇，演出成績，當可預期也。</p>
<h3>益友劇團公演「雷雨」</h3>
<p>近來「孤島」情形很爲不「孤」，尤其是戲劇界。聞二月十三日及十二日，益友社——一個擁有二千多青年朋友的正當娛樂團體的益友劇團，亦將假黃金大戲院公演「雷雨」了。</p>
<p>「人之初」導演，吳　之先生此次擔任「雷雨」導演，是給開心戲劇觀衆的好消息。我們觀「人之初」演出之成績，可聯想到「雷雨」的演出定將不會使我們失望。至於演員如章杰，陳鍾，以禮，曼蕪，吳靜，也魯等，皆有不算短的戲劇歷史，歷次在青島及上海劇藝社等演出「女子公寓」及「愛與死之搏鬭」等甚得好評。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一〇一）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>兩生兩旦兩凈爲吃戲醋眞打眞罵</p>
<p>民國八年三小白同時出演天蟾的時候，角色非常齊整。三小就是楊小樓，譚小培，尚小雲，一白就是現名荀憑生的白牧丹。當時小雲的名氣，比慧生高的多，不過兩人唱旦的路子，完全不同，尚是正工青衣，荀是花旦、刀馬。那時四大名　旦這種名稱，雖是猶未成立，可是北京城已竟有了梅毒、黃病、尚黨、白社、這四個捧角的團體，同社會上這種流行的名詞了。二十餘年來，四人中墮落了一個黃潤卿，竄了一個程硯秋，而他所補的這個缺，也正好是第二名。所差的就是小雲降成殿軍，慧生卻爬到小雲上頭來了。說起尚荀名次顚倒的原因，多少與這次的相罵，和小雲的傲性兒也有點關係。可見唱戲的還是人緣要緊，本領尤在其次呢。</p>
<p>有一天戲碼是尚荀合演的「虹霓關」，小雲飾東方氏，論起來還是東方氏吃重。後來不知從那一位名旦興的，竟把二本中的丫環當了正角，東方氏反而降成配角了。固然說丫環有一大段二六板，甚見精彩，可是東方氏思春時那塲做工夫情也很不容易呀。況且先前飾此角的還得唱一段慢板西皮，不像現在淪爲配角後只唱原板的那樣簡單。這次慧生同小雲合唱此劇，照當時二人的牌子包銀講，自然也是尚正荀副了。不過慧生那時首次南來，又有他大舅爺吳彩霞替他把塲子，當然作戲處處認眞。況他生的皮膚白皙，扮相俊秀，本來他是唱梆子花旦的，對於這種淫蕩的衣　，自屬人木三分，眞能使台下觀衆神魂顚倒，因此接二連三的彩聲，總是不曾有片刻間斷：及至小雲丫環出塲，簡直一個好都沒有得到。小雲本是自稱尚王爺（據說他上人是滿人裏世襲的什麽王）的驕傲脾氣，今天他去的又是正角，正角沒出塲以前，轟雷般的彩聲，響個不停，等到他一出來，反而鴉雀無聲了，你想他怎能忍受得住呢？所以他當時就對著慧生大罵起來，直把個荀慧生罵得「丈二和尚摸不著頭腦」。</p>

<h3>After Adjustment by Zhang Fakui, the Southern Battlefield's Chinese Army Lineup is Renewed; Yu Hanmou, Wu Qiwu, and Xia Wei are Separately Responsible for Various Military Routes; Beihai Appears Peaceful; the Western River's Grand Army to Launch Counteroffensive After the Spring Festival; Chinese Aircraft Conduct Raids for Days, Destroying Many Japanese Military Works in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The military situation on the Southern battlefield has been adjusted by Zhang Fakui, and coupled with guerrilla warfare, the lineup is renewed. According to military intelligence, the northern route is the responsibility of Yu Hanmou, whose mission is to lead the main frontal assault, with Zhang Duangui as the front-line commander. The eastern route is the responsibility of Wu Qiwu's forces, and the western route is the responsibility of Xia Wei's forces; their missions are all to provide flanking support, with Ou Zhen and Deng Longguang serving as commanders (Special dispatch, 8 PM on the 9th).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) In the northern and western reaches of the Pearl River, Japanese troops have been causing disturbances with small numbers of remnant soldiers, lacking the strength for a major offensive. The Japanese navy is still gathered in Tokyo Bay, seemingly preparing to maneuver. It is learned that the Chinese western Pearl River grand army will launch a counteroffensive after the Spring Festival. The situation in Beihai is currently peaceful (Special dispatch, 9 PM on the 9th).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chinese new air force planes have been dispatched for days to conduct bombing raids, destroying many Japanese military works in Guangzhou and along the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railway (Special dispatch, 9 PM on the 9th).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Chinese air force has been launching daily air strikes on Guangzhou, dropping bombs in Shijing and Baiyun, and bombing Japanese ships between the province and Macau to hinder their resupply and transport.

Although the Japanese troops in Weizhou are determined to advance toward Beihai, the Japanese troops in the Dongjiang and Beijiang areas are putting on a show of force, busily constructing fortifications and consolidating strongholds. The Japanese troop movements on the western and southern routes of the Pearl River are very tense, and they definitely have aggressive intentions. The Japanese troops in various areas of eastern Hubei have recently been withdrawn from the front lines and reinforced, and two regiments of a certain division have been transferred to southern Hubei, with the aim of consolidating the outer strongholds of Wuhan. The Japanese troop movements in northern Jiangxi are frequent, with the aim of destroying the heroic and isolated Chinese army in Mount Lu in one fell swoop (Dispatch, 9th).</p>

<h3>Military Spokesperson Releases Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the war situation this week, the reporter recently met with the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, who made the following statement: The war situation on both the northern and southern fronts has become increasingly favorable to us this week. The most prominent aspects are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The situation in Guangdong along the Yuehan and Guangzhou-Kowloon lines has not changed significantly. The Japanese troops entrenched in the old Sanshui, Langang, Xialegang, and Zaogang areas of Sanshui have been subjected to constant fierce attacks by our army in recent days, resulting in the annihilation of many Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese troops have been defeated and routed to Sanshui, and all these areas have been formally recovered by our army. Furthermore, the Japanese troops in Shengang also launched a joint infantry and artillery attack on the afternoon of one day, which was met with brave resistance and repeated hand-to-hand combat by our army, causing the Japanese troops to retreat completely. We are now taking advantage of the victory to encircle and attack the remaining Japanese troops in Shengang. On the southern route, approximately 30 Japanese warships are still patrolling the waters off Fangcheng, Qiongya, Xuwen, and Weizhou Island without taking any action. However, the Japanese have newly transferred two companies of chemical warfare troops from Taiwan to Guangdong, carrying 40 tons of poisonous gas, which will inevitably increase their barbaric nature and attempt to use poison to harm our officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>(2) After our army successively recovered Yuekou and Tianmen in central Hubei, more than 2,000 Japanese troops from Jingshan and Yingcheng launched another fierce attack on Tianmen towards Zaoshi. The Chinese army, taking advantage of its new victory and remaining strength, was extremely brave. After a fierce battle, the Japanese troops were completely defeated. The remaining Japanese troops in Jingshan are still under siege by our large army and have become sitting ducks. They are currently rushing to build fortifications in the suburbs, attempting to resist stubbornly. The Chinese and Japanese forces in southern and northern Hubei are still in a standoff, with no significant changes. It is judged that the Japanese troops intend to desperately maintain the consolidation of the outer perimeter of Wuhan, but it will be difficult for them to achieve their wishes under our army's encirclement and attack from all directions (To be continued).</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Aircraft Bombard Everywhere; Pingliang, Guyuan, and Beihai Bombed; Chinese Aircraft Take Off from Lanzhou to Intercept</h3>
<p>(Lanzhou) Twenty Japanese aircraft invaded Gansu via Shanxi and Shaanxi at around 10 AM on the 9th, and then split into two groups. One group of eleven aircraft flew to the skies over Pingliang at 10:20 AM and dropped bombs, while the other group of nine aircraft flew to Guyuan and dropped bombs outside the city. There was not much damage to the Chinese side. The city of Lanzhou issued an alert at 10:30 AM, and Chinese aircraft also took off to intercept them. The Japanese aircraft then regrouped and flew towards the northeast, so they did not encounter the Chinese aircraft. The alert here was not lifted until 11:30 AM (Dispatch, 9th).</p>
<p>Lian County From 7:30 AM to 4 PM on the morning of the 7th, more than ten Japanese aircraft constantly flew low and circled in Beihai. At around 10 AM, they dropped more than ten bombs next to Beihai, sinking several ships, destroying more than ten houses, and causing many deaths and injuries (Dispatch, 9th).</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Two Japanese aircraft invaded Nanchang at around 1 PM this afternoon, dropping 23 bombs in the Mozheng Street and Minde Road areas of the city. The China Light Daily and the Youth Association were destroyed. Furthermore, one Japanese aircraft was spotted spying in Dongxiang, Jinxian, Fengxin, and Jing'an counties from 10 AM to 12 PM on the morning of the 8th (Dispatch, 8th).</p>
<h3>Latest News</h3>
<p>Last night, several parts of the French Concession heard very loud gunfire and artillery fire from the direction of the Nanshi area. The Beitang Road area of Xujiahui was especially clear. Upon inquiry to the French Concession police, it was said that this was probably the result of combat by guerrilla forces in the Nanshi area. However, the police had not yet received any information about this matter. As for the military police in the French Concession, they did not fire a single shot or shell last night. The gunfire and artillery fire last night began around 8:30 PM, and then occurred again every few minutes, with a very loud sound, suggesting that heavy artillery must have been used. The leading consul general of this port, the Italian consul general, announced yesterday that the Public Concession would hold elections for new board members of the Municipal Council on April 10th and 13th.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wire Report: Chongqing Officials Observe That Japan Eagerly Seeks Peace; China and Japan Cannot Negotiate Directly</h3>
<p>Outcome of the War Depends on the Development of the European Situation; Future Peace Negotiations Must Be Mediated by the Great Powers</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese officials here yesterday provided Reuters reporters with a brief overview of military, political, economic, and social matters relating to the National Government in the current situation. They also stated emphatically that China and Japan will definitely not engage in direct peace negotiations. Therefore, there must be a Far Eastern international conference, similar in nature to the Washington Conference, to mediate in order to resolve the current Sino-Japanese war. They believe that Japan is now eager to end the current war but will insist on victor's terms, which China will never accept. The terms proposed by China are also unacceptable to Japan. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese army will launch another major offensive and then negotiate for peace in the hope of obtaining better terms. They also expect that the great powers in this peace conference will advocate maintaining China's territorial and administrative integrity, while at the same time urging China to respect Japan's treaty rights in China. The issue of suppressing communism will then become a point of contention. This complex event has not yet been properly resolved. Although there have been many reports of battles in western Shanxi, western Hubei, and eastern Guangdong in recent days, there has been no significant military development in general over the past few weeks. According to reliable Chinese sources, some Japanese troops are now quietly withdrawing from the Yangtze River basin, and it is also heard that Japanese troops are withdrawing from southern China. Chinese circles believe that the Japanese army will not launch new offensives in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, nor will they invade Guangxi from southern China. The current actions of the Japanese army in China seem to be aimed at seizing Zhengzhou and then attacking Tongguan west along the Longhai Railway in the hope of reaching Xi'an. Although this development has no significant military consequences, it is generally believed that all future Japanese military actions will be purely for the purpose of enhancing future political maneuvers. The nature of these maneuvers will be of the utmost concern to people here. Chinese circles also stated emphatically that the outcome of the current war largely depends on the future development of Europe. If war breaks out in Europe and Britain and France are victorious, then China will likely take the offensive and attempt to fight until victory. If Europe still maintains peace through consultation and mutual concession, then the great powers may exert international pressure on China and Japan to end the war through negotiations. The current international developments have destroyed the various theories of international trade. Although the London financial community strongly disagrees and still advocates free trade, China can currently only trade with foreign countries through barter because China can only exchange its products for weapons and ammunition. As for China's economic situation, it has not undergone significant changes due to the current war. The Chinese people have now limited their economic needs, which are easily met by local resources. The Sino-Japanese war has not caused major changes in Chinese society. The propertied and cultural classes still hold great power in the government, and farmers and workers are still the mainstay of the Chinese army. The Soviet Union has actively assisted China in this war, which has naturally increased the Soviet Union's prestige in China. However, the intellectual circles who rule China still firmly believe that if China hopes to achieve lasting peace and carry out the process of national revival, it must lean towards London and Washington (Reuters dispatch, 9th).</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Talks from Chongqing</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Chongqing stated that Chinese officials recently provided Reuters reporters with information regarding military, political, economic, and social matters. The contents of the talks are published in today's newspaper. Given the habits and methods of reporting and recording, I suspect that these so-called Chinese officials, by virtue of their qualifications and responsibilities, may not necessarily be speaking as spokespersons representing the Chinese Central Government. Therefore, regarding whether their statements accurately reflect the attitude of the Chinese government or whether they are precisely as the government intends to express, we have no way of definitively determining whether they are correct or not. Such officials' talks should naturally be viewed separately from the official expressions of the authorities. The content of the talks touches on many aspects, among which the following are worth commenting on: 1. China and Japan cannot engage in direct peace negotiations, so there must be a Far Eastern international conference to mediate in order to resolve the Sino-Japanese war; 2. "The issue of suppressing communism will become a point of contention. This complex event has not yet been properly resolved"; 3. The outcome of the current war largely depends on the future development of Europe. If war breaks out in Europe and Britain and France are victorious, then China will likely take the offensive and attempt to fight until victory. If Europe still maintains peace through consultation and mutual concession, then the great powers may exert international pressure on China and Japan to end the war through negotiations; 4. China's economic situation has not caused major social changes due to the war; 6. The Soviet Union, by actively assisting China, has greatly increased its prestige in China, but the intellectual class ruling China firmly believes that if China obtains lasting peace, then it must lean towards London and Washington when carrying out the revival process.</p>
<p>After extracting the above five points worthy of comment, the first reaction that arises intuitively is the deep conviction that officials' talks should not be equated with the official expressions of the authorities, and the deep suspicion that the tone has been distorted.</p>
<p>Next, please allow me to separately describe my thoughts on the above five points: Regarding the Sino-Japanese war, Japan has no way to clean up the war; to conquer China is impossible, considering its assessed strength, and to use puppets to control Chinese is impossible, knowing that tests have failed; to use puppets to act as the protagonists of the so-called new order is factually disproven as impossible as the military occupation zones are threatened by guerrilla forces. As for China, it has been responding to war from the beginning, not initiating it, defending itself and seeking survival, not invading. Therefore, fundamentally, it does not want war. It only had no choice but to fight when forced to do so; and because its survival is at stake, it does not dare to speak of ending the war unless it wins, and it does not dare to think of making peace unless Japan stops its aggression and withdraws its troops. Precisely because of this, regardless of whether the Sino-Japanese war will end in fact with a Far Eastern international conference in the future, and regardless of whether any of our allied countries have proposed to China to convene a Far Eastern international conference in the international arena, how dare China, which is in the midst of fighting for its survival, place the slightest hope on an international conference that would cause China to stop resisting and attempt to make peace? In other words: The issue of the Far Eastern international conference depends on Japan, while China, at this stage, has absolutely no such issue of a Far Eastern international conference. In fact, the so-called Far Eastern issue is originally just a question of whether Japan invades or not. No invasion means no war, which means peace. No invasion and a plan to handle the aftermath of the war is good, a Far Eastern international conference is good, and direct negotiations are also good. In other words; it can only be said that Japan must stop invading, and there is no such thing as China needing an international conference.</p>
<p>Regarding the so-called issue of suppressing communism, I only suspect that the telegraph's Morse code was incorrect. Because the Communist Party in China is loyal to the nation and devoted to resisting the enemy, there is nothing to suppress, nor should it be suppressed. There is also no communism in Japan that needs to be suppressed, or that should be suppressed. Soviet Russia is indeed a communist country, but that is Soviet Russia's business. The facts are all before our eyes: China has not been threatened by Soviet Russia, nor has Soviet Russia invaded Japan. Therefore, there is no issue of suppressing communism in the Far East, so how can there be a so-called "complex event?" Why wait for a so-called "proper solution!"</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese war and the overall European situation, there is a non-isolatable impact between them. However, China only hopes that the European disputes will be resolved peacefully; if, unfortunately, war cannot be avoided, then no matter what the outcome is, no matter how thick or thin China's feelings towards the various countries are, and no matter how the war between the various countries affects China, China, under aggression, will definitely continue to resist to the end. The strategic factors on which the decision to advance, retreat, defend, or attack is based are consistent; that Japan must stop its aggression, and China must fight until final victory are consistent; how can there be such a thing as a counteroffensive if Britain and France are victorious? How can there be such a thing as starting to seek victory if Britain and France are victorious?</p>
<p>Regarding China's economic situation and post-war tendencies, the foundation of China's economy lies in its rural areas, which have not yet been modernized. Only in the rural areas, does the foundation occupy a congenital and vast space. Only this space is not afraid of trampling and can be used for sustained operations, consuming violence and subduing the enemy's life, which is the main factor. To say that the war will cause major changes in general economic and social organization is only true for industrial and commercial capital countries. Only without great changes, will the post-war revival depend on obtaining assistance for revival; the source of assistance is where the inclination lies; whether the assistance is obtained from Britain, the United States, Soviet Russia, there is no choice among them; this is not subject to subjective preferences, nor can it be shifted by empty talk of closeness or distance. To say that it must lean towards London and Washington is indeed good and亲近, but to assert it now, is it not too early!</p>
<p>In short, the issues discussed by a certain official are very interesting. However, there are contents that we cannot rashly agree with, and I have described my thoughts here.</p>
<h3>Border Conflicts Erupt Frequently, Japanese-Russian Relations are Tense, Japanese-Puppet Troops' Provocation Repelled, South Manchuria Railway Busy Transporting Troops</h3>
<p>(Moscow) February 6th. A detachment of Soviet border guards, under the command of Lieutenant Yu Xike of the Novotsurukhaidu border station, stationed on Soviet-owned island No. 227 on the Ergune River, 1.5 kilometers east of the border station, was suddenly fired upon by a detachment of Japanese-puppet soldiers with rifles. The border guards immediately returned fire, forcing the Japanese-puppet soldiers to retreat to the Japanese-puppet border station 4 kilometers southeast of Novotsurukhaidu village. The Soviet side suffered no casualties. The next day, Japanese-puppet troops again opened fire with heavy machine guns from the puppet territory towards Lieutenant Yu's border guards. Under the cover of two heavy machine guns and fifty infantry rifles in the puppet territory, they concentrated forty men to land on the aforementioned island and attack Lieutenant Yu's detachment. After receiving reinforcements from the border station, the border guards defeated the Japanese-puppet troops, forcing them to withdraw from the island and retreat to the puppet territory. The Red Army suffered one death and two injuries.</p>
<p>Several days ago, the Soviet government issued a warning to the Japanese government regarding the provocations of the Japanese-puppet troops. Today, the Japanese-puppet troops continue to provoke. The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo has been instructed to protest to the Japanese government again, demanding that they be stopped.</p>
<p>According to the Qiqihar Treaty concluded in 1911 between the Chinese government and the former Imperial Russian government, the aforementioned Island No. 227 on the Ergune River and Island No. 279, where a conflict occurred on January 31, both belong to the Soviet Union.

<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign news reports that due to the increasingly sharp fishing industry issue between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Japanese military, eager to transport troops and ammunition, has designated the South Manchuria Railway exclusively for military use starting from the 1st. Passenger ticket sales between Dalian and Changchun have been suspended, and a large number of troops, ammunition, and military provisions are being transported to northern Manchuria.

<h3>Important Documents Stolen from the Japanese Army Ministry, Sold to Soviet Minister of War by Anti-War Association Chairman Kobayashi, Criticized by Prince Kan'in</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign news reports that anti-war sentiment is developing widely within Japan and is now tending towards action. A large number of officials in the Army Ministry have secretly joined the Anti-War Association. On December 30th of last year, important official documents from the Army Ministry were stolen by Machijiri, an official in the military, and sold to Kobayashi, the chairman of the association, who secretly sold them to a certain country. Because one part of the documents concerned the Japanese military's war preparations and methods of troop replenishment, and another part concerned the operational plan against the Soviet Union in northern Manchuria, both of which were extremely important, Minister of War Itagaki was severely reprimanded by Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in. Now Itagaki is conducting a massive search, and Machijiri and others have been severely punished. Several officials in the Army Ministry have also been implicated, while Kobayashi, the chairman of the Anti-War Association, has fled to the United States. (Dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Chen Shouming in Chongqing, Pays Respects to Chairman Lin</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Overseas Chinese Senator Chen Shouming, after arriving in Chongqing, paid respects to Chairman Lin together with his secretary He Xiang, and successively visited the heads of various ministries and commissions. Chairman Lin and others greatly comforted and encouraged Chen for his services to the country overseas. Chairman Chiang was also very clear about Chen's efforts overseas and will summon him in the coming days. Furthermore, as a prominent overseas Chinese merchant, Chen is deeply interested in developing the motherland's economy. He plans to be hosted by the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the coming days and go to various places to inspect transportation and economic development in the rear, as well as other aspects of construction.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Hankou Organize a Large-Scale Anti-War Movement, Preparing to Unite with Various Parties to Hold a Major Riot, The Plot Leaked and Nearly One Hundred People Arrested</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Anti-war sentiment among Japanese troops is rising. Recently, the Japanese troops in Hankou have a large-scale anti-war organization, preparing to unite with anti-war elements from various parties to carry out a large-scale riot, echoing the riot of Japanese troops in Tianjin some time ago. Unexpectedly, the plot leaked and was discovered by the Japanese Kempeitai Headquarters, which arrested twelve ringleaders, thirty army officers and soldiers, fifty-five rōnin, and eight White Russians. These anti-war elements have already been escorted to Shanghai for punishment by Sato, the chief of the political training section. (Dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, the left-leaning ideology among Japanese troops in China is rising due to the reversal of the war situation, and various secret organizations are developing rapidly. A group called the Seinen-tō has established a branch in Hongkou, Shanghai, led by a young soldier. The internal organization is quite strict. Initially, it was just a propaganda of an ideology, but recently it has been put into practical action. Left-leaning leaflets of theirs are often found in the Hongkou area, and there are even slogans supporting the Three Principles of the People, which proves that the Japanese warlords' war of aggression has now inevitably triggered a surge of anger in their own people's revolution.

<h3>Xiong Deshan Dies of Illness</h3>
<p>Guilin, Guangxi. Xiong Deshan, a famous professor at Guangxi University, died of illness a few days ago. The cultural circles here deeply mourn his passing and are planning to hold a memorial meeting. Professor Xiong was fifty years old and was one of the few historians in the country. He had profound research in philosophy, economics, political science, sociology, etc., and was therefore able to provide an accurate analysis of Chinese history. The professor had many writings and translations during his lifetime, and his contribution to culture was enormous. His sudden death is a great loss to the Chinese academic community.

<h3>Wu Peifu's Adopted Son Issues Written Statement, Willing to Work for Peace if China's Territorial Sovereignty is Intact, Whether This is Wu's True Intention is Difficult to Confirm</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wu Qixun (transliteration), the adopted son of Wu Peifu, hosted a banquet last night and issued a written statement with ambiguous meaning, roughly saying that recently, outsiders have been asking him about his father's views and position on the current situation. He himself is still in his school days, young and lacking in learning, and should not comment on politics. However, since he has received frequent inquiries from all parties, he will, from the position of a son, elaborate on his father's attitude towards the current situation. He often heard his father say, "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he has been deeply worried. My father believes that all people are born equal and free. Since the rise of the theory of natural selection, there has been cruel warfare. It has been more than twenty years since the Great War, but the world's vitality has not yet recovered. Japan has suffered from the aftermath of the World War and has been unable to expand its trade, so the impact it has suffered is very great. As for China, it has already had twenty years of civil war, and its national strength has visibly declined, so it should not suffer from the scourge of war again. But unfortunately, the war has been prolonged and has now lasted for two years. If it is prolonged further, then no matter who wins or loses, they will all perish together. There is an ancient saying, 'Weapons are ominous instruments, and if they are not restrained, they will consume themselves.' Therefore, my father deeply hopes that both sides will take this as a warning. However, although my father loves peace, his so-called peace is by no means that China should surrender to Japan. My father believes that China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity must be completely intact. Whether my father will come out of seclusion depends on whether these basic conditions can be realized. Furthermore, my father must be able to have freedom of action, my father must possess military force, and he must be free to express his personal views. If these points can be achieved, then my father will be able to take on the mission of peace. Also, my father has retired from politics in recent years and has been engaged in writing, and he has no political ambitions. He simply does not want the people to suffer, so he has only slightly expressed his views." Wu Qixun added that this is roughly what he has heard from his father's usual conversations. According to the draft speech given by Wu Peifu to the Associated Press when he met with Chinese and foreign journalists on January 30, the general idea was also as above, but the tone was slightly stronger. Therefore, it can be considered Wu Peifu's view, but Wu has been living in seclusion recently and cannot be met, so it is difficult to confirm whether his intention is indeed as such.

<h3>Japan Illegally Blockades the Pearl River, Britain Prepares to Negotiate Again, Japan Does Not Intend to Respond Immediately to Memorandums from Britain, the United States, and France</h3>
<p>(London) British Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons yesterday in response to a question from Milner of the Conservative Party that the petition from the Hong Kong British Chamber of Commerce, conveyed by the British Consul-General in Guangzhou, requesting the British government to pay attention to the continued blockade of the Pearl River, is now receiving the government's urgent consideration and that the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce will be replied to by the appropriate authorities soon. The government advocates continuing to find ways to achieve the goal of opening the Pearl River. Alexander of the Labour Party asked whether the government anticipates that the Pearl River negotiations will be more effective than the Yangtze River negotiations. Butler replied that the questioner must know that the Pearl River is an area that the Japanese side can designate as a military activity area, so there are some difficulties, but the British government is currently doing its best to negotiate. Milner asked whether the blockade of the Pearl River is a completely illegal act if Japan has not formally declared war on China. Butler replied that the government will keep in mind the various considerations regarding this matter. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(London) British Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons yesterday in response to a question from Milner of the Conservative Party that the matter of Japan preventing the Shanghai Dredging Bureau from carrying out channel dredging work is still under discussion. Some progress has been made in this matter. Foreign Secretary Halifax has not recently received any reports of channel siltation. Milner asked whether the government could apply some pressure to the Japanese government, as this matter would not only benefit Britain but also benefit all countries. Butler replied that the British government is presenting the importance of this matter in the course of the Shanghai negotiations. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo news reports that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, while answering questions from lawmakers in the House of Representatives budget debate this afternoon, used extremely arrogant wording. The main points were: The government does not intend to submit a reply immediately to the memorandums to Japan from the governments of Britain, the United States, and France; the governments of Britain, the United States, and France will not take joint action on all issues; even if the three countries take joint action, the Japanese government does not want to attach importance to it. Arita continued, "Japan attaches great importance to Japanese-American relations. The issue of submitting replies to the British and American governments is currently under investigation by the authorities. As for how to reply and when to reply, everything has not been decided." Regarding the rumors that Britain and the United States are taking joint action against Japan, Arita said that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese incident, Britain and the United States have not taken joint action, but the two countries have recently submitted notes to Japan with the same wording, and the oral expressions of the ambassadors of the two countries to the Japanese government also have the same wording. Although both ambassadors have expressed that the two countries have taken action after consultation, this cannot be considered a joint action by the two countries. At the same time, according to Paris newspapers, France's submission of a memorandum to Japan does not mean that France is taking joint action with Britain and the United States. Arita said that Britain and the United States lack common interests in the Far East, so the two countries will not take joint action, and even if the two countries take joint action, Japan does not need to attach importance to it.

<h3>Japanese Warship Runs Aground</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, a Japanese transport ship weighing 5,660 tons ran aground on an island in the Hongji Bay near the northeast of Haiphong a few days ago due to mistaking its course. It is said that there were not many soldiers on board, but there was a lot of military equipment. After the ship ran aground, it immediately sent out a distress signal, which attracted the attention of the French Navy. It is also said that the ship has now run aground and the hull has been severely damaged, but there is no immediate danger of sinking. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 9th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Congressman Proposes Convening International Conference to Discuss Disarmament and Rebuild Peace, Echoing Chamberlain's Proposal</h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Congress is planning today to convene an international disarmament conference. This move is entirely in line with British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent statement in the House of Commons that he will try to hold a world peace conference. Representative Lauterbach of the Indiana Democratic Party has sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, suggesting that the United States convene a world naval conference to discuss the issue of limiting armaments. This letter was delivered to Hull immediately after a speech by Congressman Kim of the Utah Democratic Party. According to Congressman Kim, he will try to obtain international agreement by a resolution of the Senate to reduce or limit armaments. (Associated Press dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain said in the House of Commons today that Britain is currently working hard to prepare to hold a world peace conference. Chamberlain made this statement in response to a question about the government's attitude towards using this conference to remedy the economic, financial, and political crises. (Associated Press dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) U.S. Ambassador Bullitt, after returning from Washington, visited Foreign Minister Bonnet here today and told him about the evolution of U.S. foreign policy. While Ambassador Bullitt was in Washington, he held many talks with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, and, together with Ambassador Kennedy to Britain, reported on the European situation to the Senate Army Committee. At that time, it was widely rumored that the ambassadors had said that a European war this spring was inevitable. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Hiranuma Explains Future Policy, Promote Industrial Production, Konoe Remains in Current Position</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiranuma stated last night at a banquet hosted by former Prime Minister Konoe for members of the House of Peers that Konoe has no intention of resigning from his concurrent position as Minister Without Portfolio because he requested Konoe to take this position to indicate that the policies of the previous cabinet will continue, and the political situation has not changed. Hiranuma also mentioned the government's future policy, saying that it will focus its efforts on expanding the productivity of various industries and strengthening the mobilization of various items.

<h3>Japanese Admiral Kato Tomosaburo Dies</h3>

<h3>The Netherlands Does Not Abandon Overseas Territories, Britain and the Netherlands Exchange Information on Far East Joint Defense at Any Time</h3>
<p>The Hague. Minister of Economic Affairs Welter declared in the House of Representatives that the Netherlands will never abandon any of its overseas colonies, no matter how small their area. (Havas dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(London) During a cabinet meeting in the House of Commons this afternoon, opposition Labour Party member Fletcher asked whether the two governments have held talks regarding the issue of defense cooperation between Britain and the Netherlands in the Far East. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied, "The British government has regularly exchanged information on various technical issues related to national defense with certain governments, including the Dutch government. Apart from this, no special talks have been conducted." According to the Standard Evening News, Dutch Foreign Minister Patijn is extremely worried because Germany's expansion of power in Europe is enough to threaten the Netherlands, and Japan's expansion of power in the Far East is also enough to endanger the Dutch East Indies. He will come to London within a week to hold talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>The United States Should Strengthen National Defense Urgently, The House Committee Passes Bill Based on Roosevelt's Message</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt submitted a national defense message to Congress on the 12th of last month (proposing to immediately allocate US$552,000,000 to strengthen national defense). Afterwards, the House Army Committee, based on this message, unanimously passed a bill yesterday, which has been submitted to the House Secretariat today. Its contents include the construction of 3,032 army aircraft and the designation of US$32,000,000 for training civilian aviation pilots and subsidizing private aircraft factories. It also designates US$23,000,000 for strengthening the defense of the Panama Canal. The committee provided a separate opinion on this bill, stating briefly that "the European crisis is fraught with danger, and the disaster of war is about to break out." This can be seen from the large purchases of aircraft by Britain and France. In view of this situation, the United States should immediately increase the total number of army aircraft and strengthen other defenses so that the United States can be prepared for any eventuality. It is necessary to maintain the coast with this sufficient strength of both the army and the air force. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Poland's Position is Pivotal, German Newspaper Continues to Vigorously Criticize Roosevelt</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers seem to be concerned about Poland's strong attitude towards dictatorial countries, believing that it was caused by President Roosevelt's recent remarks, so they have begun to criticize President Roosevelt again. The Hamburg Daily News said that a certain Polish newspaper openly discussed the issue of France and Poland repairing their old friendship, saying first that President Roosevelt's actions have given France and Poland's cooperation a great impetus. The newspaper and the National Daily News both said that President Roosevelt should be held responsible for the resurgence of international tensions. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Warsaw. Poland's diplomatic activities will have an important manifestation recently. According to reliable sources, in addition to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, who is scheduled to come here on February 25 for a visit, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is also scheduled to visit Warsaw in early March. At the same time, political figures have confirmed that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky also has news of a visit to Poland. Warsaw welcomes the visit of the Romanian Foreign Minister, believing that it is a manifestation of the Romanian government's respect for the Romanian-Polish Convention.

<h3>French Ambassador Naggiar Arrives in Russia to Take Office</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The new French Ambassador Naggiar has arrived here and has delivered a copy of his credentials to Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov. Tomorrow, he will meet with Deputy Foreign People's Commissar, i.e., former ambassador to France, Potemkin. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<h3>Amidst Tense Franco-Italian Relations, Italy Continues to Increase Troops in North Africa, Military Preparations are Still Underway and Not Alarmed by British-French Cooperation</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain made a declaration in the House of Commons this afternoon, stating that according to information obtained by the government, the Italian government is about to send 30,000 army troops to the Libyan colony in North Africa. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here declared that after Italy recently sent 30,000 army troops to the Libyan colony in North Africa, another 30,000 troops will be sent in the coming days to strengthen defenses. British officials said that France has a large force stationed in North Africa, which is enough to prevent Italy from recklessly invading French Tunisia. The Italian government's repeated increase in troops to Libya, although said to be intended to raise the number of troops to be on par with France, in fact, the threat to Britain is at least equal to that of France, because the threat to Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in the future is no different from the situation when Italy repeatedly increased troops to Libya before the signing of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Prime Minister Chamberlain just made a declaration in the House of Commons on the 6th of this month, stating that when France is threatened, no matter where the threat comes from, Britain will provide France with full assistance. The Italian government's increase of troops to Libya at this time is by no means a coincidence. According to news from Burgos, Spain, the Spanish National Army government is financially strapped and intends to send Italian volunteers back to their country as soon as possible so that it can obtain loans from Britain. The relationship between these Italian volunteers and Spanish National Army officers and soldiers is also extremely bad, and it is indeed difficult to continue this cooperation for a long time. All of these things weaken Italy's position in the Mediterranean. According to news from Rome, Italy is extremely uneasy after the resignation of the Stojadinović cabinet in Yugoslavia, because the new Prime Minister Cvetković of Southern Country is known to be pro-French. If Italy has a conflict with France in the future, it must also station troops in the border area adjacent to Southern Country to prevent accidents. According to news from Burgos, Spain, the National Army government of Western Country is facing financial difficulties and intends to send the Italian volunteers back to their country as soon as possible in order to obtain loans from Britain. The relationship between these Italian volunteers and the officers and soldiers of the Western National Army is also extremely bad, and it is indeed difficult to maintain this cooperation for a long time. All of these things will weaken Italy's position in the Mediterranean. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Rome. Official diplomatic intelligence agencies today reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent remarks in the House of Commons about British-French unity and cooperation did not surprise responsible circles in Rome. Fascist Italy was not alarmed by this because Italy had already recognized that the existence of a true British-French military alliance was inevitable. At this time, there is no need to be concerned about whether this military alliance is for defensive warfare against omnipotent countries or for aggressive warfare, otherwise we will have no way to explain the Anglo-Soviet Agreement of April 16 last year and the Franco-German Agreement of December 6. Italy will continue to pursue its peace policy, but it cannot but draw the conclusion that Italy must continue to work hard to accelerate the completion of national military preparations. This kind of effort will definitely be successful. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>French Defense Committee Holds Joint Meeting, Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force All Attend, Naval Strength is Sufficient to Cope with Incidents</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Naval, Army, and Air Force Committees of the Senate held a joint meeting this morning. Minister of National Defense and Minister of the Army Daladier, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, and Minister of Aviation La Chambre all attended in person. The discussion mainly focused on naval issues. First, the rapporteur presented a report, stating that the general situation of the French fleet is satisfactory, and that it is sufficient to cope with any incident, whether alone or in cooperation with the British Navy. Minister Campinchi then explained the general situation of the French fleet, as well as the shipbuilding situation, and said that French shipbuilding matters have been actively implemented according to an overall plan. (Havas dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the European War, the Defense Committee held a meeting here today for only the second time, because the committee is only convened in times of crisis. The purpose of today's meeting was to listen to a report on the rearmament of France. There are a total of three meetings this week. At a time when Franco-Italian relations are tense, these meetings are generally considered important. (Associated Press dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French right-wing newspaper "Journal" reported this morning that Prime Minister Daladier made a speech at a closed-door meeting of the Defense Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives, stating that if war breaks out, France must fight alone in the first week, because British assistance cannot be so rapid. However, Daladier solemnly declared that Britain would do its utmost to assist France. A certain senator immediately asked the Prime Minister, "If a war breaks out, can we get effective assistance from the Soviet Union?" To this, the Prime Minister's answer was ambiguous, only hinting at the relations between the Soviet Union and Poland and Romania. Regarding the strength of the French army, the Prime Minister declared that although the number of recruits is extraordinarily small at present, after this stage, the number of recruits in France will increase significantly every year, reaching about 100,000 in the first year and 150,000 in the second year. Daladier also provided assurances to the meeting, saying that the mobilization experience in France in September of last year revealed many shortcomings, which have now been completely improved, and it can be guaranteed that there will be no worries when the mobilization order is exercised in the future.

<h3>Spanish Nationalist Army Lands on Minorca Island; Fierce Fighting with Government Garrison; Britain Actively Involved; Rome Indignant</h3>
<p>Burgos: Nationalist forces have landed on Minorca Island and are fighting with government troops (Havas, 9th).</p>
<p>(London) Of the Spanish-owned Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, Majorca Island has been occupied by Nationalist forces. However, Minorca Island is still garrisoned by Spanish government troops. Diplomatic sources here claim that Colonel Luis, commander of the Nationalist forces on Majorca Island, recently sailed to Mahon, Minorca Island, aboard the British cruiser HMS "Devonshire," where he immediately discussed takeover matters with the authorities on Minorca Island (Havas, 9th).</p>
<p>(London) Colonel Luis, commander of the Nationalist forces on Spanish-owned Majorca Island, sailed to Mahon, Minorca Island yesterday aboard the British cruiser HMS "Devonshire" to confer with representatives of the government forces on the island regarding the takeover of Minorca Island. It is understood that the ship has already left Mahon but is still anchored off the coast of Minorca Island. According to reports received here, a British official was present when Colonel Luis negotiated with the representatives of Minorca Island on the ship yesterday. Diplomatic sources claim that the British government's task is only to mediate between the two sides of the Spanish civil war. It was only at the request of the Nationalist authorities that the cruiser HMS "Devonshire" was provided for their use (Havas, 9th).</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign reports suggest that Britain intends to assist the Spanish Nationalist forces in taking over Minorca Island. Newspapers here have expressed indignation upon hearing this. Il Piccolo stated, "This is a British strategy, the purpose of which is to prevent Italian legionnaires from participating when the Nationalist forces occupy Minorca Island." Il Popolo di Roma stated that Britain is encouraging the Nationalist authorities to occupy the island, but on the condition that Italian legionnaires do not participate. The British government is even preparing to provide several warships for the Nationalist forces to use for troop deployment in preparation for taking over the island (Havas, 9th).</p>
<p>Saint-Barthélemy: News arrived last night from Minorca Island, which is controlled by government forces, stating that a bloody incident has occurred among the residents of the island. For two weeks, no ships or vessels have delivered food, and a food panic has nearly broken out. Since the Nationalist forces occupied Barcelona, the government forces' supply of food to the island has been cut off. As a result, the emotions of the islanders have risen, sparking a movement to surrender to the Nationalist forces. It is reported that the islanders have also formed processions, demanding that the island be ceded to the Nationalist forces. Nationalist planes flew to the island for reconnaissance and remotely saw that white flags or red, yellow, and red flags were hoisted on some rooftops (Haitong Telegraph, 9th).</p>
<h3>Nationalist Forces Advance Rapidly, Occupy Figueras with Little Resistance</h3>
<p>Barcelona: General Franco's troops occupied the city of Figueras yesterday evening. The battle for the city was won by the Fourth Division of the Navarre Army. The attack was quite difficult because all the main roads outside the city had been completely destroyed by the government forces, and all the bridges were broken. However, there was little strong resistance. The enemy only fired machine guns to cover the retreat of their army. The city is twenty-four kilometers away from the border town of Perthus and usually has a population of about 14,000 people (Haitong Telegraph, 9th).</p>
<p>La Jonquera: Franco's troops arrived at the border here at 2:05 PM today (10:05 PM Shanghai time) and planted the Nationalist flag on the Spanish border (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>Burgos: The Nationalist forces have occupied Sant Joan de les Abadesses, an important industrial city 15 miles from the French-Spanish border (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>Figueras: After the Nationalist forces arrived in the city tonight, the Italian army units that had accompanied the Nationalist forces in their advance toward the French border area were transferred from the front lines to the rear (Havas, 8th).</p>
<p>La Jonquera: The fortress of Figueras was destroyed today, and the sound of the explosion was terrifying. It is not yet certain whether it was intentionally destroyed or accidental. A few days ago, the Republican government's cabinet and ministers were still using the cellar under the fortress to hold cabinet meetings. The government had just moved away when the fortress became the target of repeated bombing by Nationalist planes. At the same time, the Nationalist forces advanced towards Figueras amidst strong resistance from the Republican army (Reuters, 8th).</p>

<h3>London Observes the Situation in Spain; Ceasefire Not Far Off; Britain and France Striving to Mediate; Berlin and Rome Gradually Feeling Uneasy</h3>
<p>(London) The British government believes that the Spanish government forces' strength to resist has greatly weakened, and a ceasefire is not far off. Britain's diplomacy with the Spanish Nationalist forces will then be correspondingly developed. Regarding this matter, the Foreign Office is currently awaiting two reports. One is the answer of General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, to the peace terms proposed by the Republican government. The other is the report of the government forces authorities on Spanish-owned Minorca Island regarding the negotiations for the takeover of the island with the Nationalist representatives on the British cruiser HMS "Devonshire" yesterday. In addition, after the Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican government, Negrín, met with representatives of Britain and France yesterday, he confirmed that there were three conditions for a ceasefire: 1. Withdrawal of foreign volunteers; 2. Issuance of a general amnesty; 3. Holding a plebiscite. Yesterday, it was reported that General Franco was willing to accept the first and second conditions, but firmly rejected the third. Although Prime Minister Negrín and General Miaja, commander of the Central Army, said that if the above three conditions were not fully accepted by the Nationalist forces, the government forces would continue to resist to the end, British officials believe that the Republican government's adoption of this attitude is to seek more favorable conditions and not to truly resist to the end. Therefore, even if the Nationalist government insists on its original position and refuses to accept the third condition, the door for mediating the war will not be completely closed. According to news from Rome and Berlin, the British and French governments have had many contacts with the Spanish Nationalist authorities, and the German and Italian governments have become increasingly uneasy. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, after Prime Minister Chamberlain visited Pope Pius XI in Rome last month, the Vatican urged the Spanish Nationalist authorities not to go too far. This is related to General Franco's current friendly attitude towards Britain and France (Havas, 9th).</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers believe that the reported mediation of the Spanish civil war by Britain and France is "diplomatic interference." The Völkischer Beobachter, the mouthpiece of the Nazi Party, stated that there is currently a clear attempt to hinder Franco from achieving a victorious peace. The actions of Britain and France are purely for power and political considerations, because Spain has a special relationship with the position of Britain and France in the Mediterranean (Reuters, 7th).</p>
<h3>Internal Disagreements within the Spanish Government; Prime Minister Advocates Continuing Resistance; Azaña May Resign</h3>
<p>(Paris) Spanish President Azaña arrived here this morning from Geneva. The Spanish Ambassador to France and representatives of the French Foreign Ministry welcomed him at the station. Sources close to the Spanish government army suggest that Spanish Prime Minister Negrín may resign due to disagreements with the Spanish President regarding the issue of continuing resistance against the Nationalist forces. Some French newspapers are urging the authorities to immediately fully recognize General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist forces, so that France can provide effective assistance in resolving the Spanish conflict (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>Perthus, France: The Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican government, Negrín, along with Finance Minister Aspe, Army Chief of Staff General Rojo, and other important figures, came here from Spain today. The military attaché of the French Embassy in Spain and representatives of the Spanish Embassy in France greeted them at the station. Spanish Foreign Minister Del Vayo subsequently gave a speech to the newspapers, saying that Prime Minister Negrín was extremely grateful for the kindness and assistance of the French authorities in helping Spanish refugees. According to well-informed sources, Prime Minister Negrín will return to the city of Valencia, Spain, to continue to preside over the resistance after all the government troops on the Catalonia Autonomous Region front line have safely retreated into France (Havas, 8th).</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government is now considering recognizing the Nationalist government of Franco in Spain, based on the draft resolution brought back by Senator Bérard, who recently went to Burgos as an unofficial envoy. It is expected that the Nationalist forces will reach the French border in several places today. The main force of the government troops in the interior and along the coast may cross into French territory at any time. According to news from Madrid, mediation is unlikely to be achieved, and the government will continue to resist. The new headquarters of the government army will likely be located in Alicante, Cartagena, or Albacete (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>French Representative Returns to Paris; Reports to Foreign Minister Bonnet on the Negotiations in Spain</h3>
<p>(Paris) Bérard, the unofficial French ambassador to the Nationalist capital, returned from Burgos yesterday and paid a visit to Foreign Minister Bonnet at noon. It is said that Bérard reported on his meetings with Nationalist Foreign Minister General Jordana and General Franco's staff. Prime Minister Daladier also received Bérard. Sources in charge say that Bérard told Bonnet that the talks he had held in Spain were very sincere and that the Nationalist authorities had understood this, with which he was very satisfied. The main purpose of Bérard's mission was to deal with the refugee problem. According to Bérard, the Nationalist authorities and France are equally eager for the refugees to return home. The French government will now study the issue of establishing normal diplomatic relations with Burgos. Bérard will return to Spain after the government has decided on this issue (Reuters, 8th).</p>
<p>(Paris) Bérard, the French Senator who was sent to Burgos, paid a visit to Prime Minister Daladier yesterday to report on the results of his talks in Spain, expressing optimism about the future of Franco-Spanish relations. Bérard stated that there were no major difficulties between France and Spain at present. The two countries were completely dependent on each other economically and culturally, so the traditional Franco-Spanish friendship would not undergo any adverse changes. Political figures did not fully agree with Bérard's optimistic attitude. It was pointed out that there were still many difficulties in adjusting relations between France and the Spanish Nationalist forces. In addition to the many opposing opinions within France, many issues remained unresolved in Bérard's negotiations with Spanish Nationalist Foreign Minister Jordana. The most important of these was the issue of the return of Spanish government troops to Spanish territory. The French authorities believed that they had a responsibility to plan properly for the safety of these Spanish soldiers seeking refuge in France. In other words, they had to obtain guarantees from the Nationalist authorities before agreeing to hand over the Spanish government troops in the French concentration camps to the Spanish Nationalist forces. Secondly, the issue of the return of Spanish military supplies now in France would also cause major difficulties. Before handing over these military supplies to the Nationalist forces, France would first need to discuss the diplomatic and legal relations between the two countries in detail (Haitong Telegraph, 9th).</p>
<h3>General Miaja Expresses Determination to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>(London) General Miaja, commander-in-chief of the Spanish government forces, told a special correspondent of the Daily Express today that he had no intention of leaving the government army and conducting peace talks with Franco. Miaja emphasized, "We will continue to resist. Even if heaven abandons us, we will do what we know is impossible. Moreover, the government army still has more than 500,000 well-trained and fully equipped troops, and there are still 500,000 reserve troops that can continue to fight" (Haitong Telegraph, 9th).</p>
<h3>More Than 80,000 Republican Soldiers Have Entered France in the Last Two Days</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Republican army accelerated its withdrawal from Catalonia and is now crossing the border into France in an orderly fashion, led by officers, rather than in scattered small groups. It is estimated that more than 80,000 Republican soldiers have been disarmed since 4:00 PM yesterday. On one occasion, an entire battalion of 600 soldiers, 20 cars, and 50 donkey carts retreated to the border. The 26th Division, entirely composed of anarchist members, retreated to Puigcerdà at night. According to the Republican army, they used tanks as a rearguard to protect the retreat, and the order was well-maintained. It is rumored that almost all of the Republican army's artillery has been withdrawn (Reuters, 8th).</p>
<h3>Palestinian Problem Conference Opens Yesterday; Britain Holds First Talks with Jewish Representatives</h3>
<p>(London) British representatives and Jewish representatives held their first talks on the Palestinian problem at St. James's Palace at 10:00 PM tonight. The Jewish delegation, led by Dr. Weizmann, Chairman of the Jewish Agency, will present its views on Jewish demands. It is likely that what he will say will be largely the same as what he said to the Palestine Royal Commission in 1936. Today, the two Arab parties were in contact with each other, and a kind of direct contact has been established between them. This can be seen from the fact that Sheikh al-Mughrabi (former Egyptian Prime Minister) and Hamouda (Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Hejaz), representatives of the Grand Mufti's party, visited representatives of the Arab Defense Party this morning. After a brief one-hour talk, representatives of the Defense Party visited Arab representative Fakhri al-Nashashibi at the hotel and dined with Prince Saif al-Islam of Yemen. They then drove to the British House of Commons to meet with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and held talks with Colonial Secretary MacDonald (Reuters, 8th).</p>
<p>(London) The two Arab delegations attending the Palestine Conference are said to have resolved their differences. Representatives of the Defense Party will participate in the discussions of the conference at the same time as representatives of the Arab Higher Committee. One of the elected representatives has not yet arrived in London, but those who have arrived will attend the meeting this afternoon (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>Fire Breaks Out in Sugar-Producing Area of the Philippines; 3,000 Homeless; Suspected Arson by Strikers</h3>
<p>(Manila) A large fire broke out in the suburbs of San Fernando, Pampanga Province. According to the governor's estimate, the losses amounted to 1.5 million pesos. Although there were no deaths or injuries, 3,000 people were left homeless. The area is a wealthy sugar-producing region, and thousands of factory workers have recently gone on strike. The fire is suspected to be arson, motivated by resentment over the police's disbanding of gatherings. The local Catholic Church, a symbol of ancient times in the Philippines, was also among those destroyed. In addition, many Chinese-owned bakeries and hardware stores were burned down. Trains departing from San Fernando were filled with disaster-stricken people, while trains heading to the area were filled with rescue teams and news reporters. The fire started at night and was not contained until 12:30 PM today. The fire started in a vegetable market and quickly spread due to the arid weather. By 8:00 AM this morning, the estimated losses had reached 500,000 pesos. The farmers in Pampanga Province were extremely agitated last night, and the authorities dispatched additional police to suppress them. The farmers were dissatisfied with the authorities' forcible order to resolve the strike according to their terms, but the factory workers have agreed to resume work. The situation is quite bad. Philippine President Quezon has decided to personally go to the area within a few days to advise the strikers not to make excessive demands (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Small Political Parties Fail to Form a Unified Party</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The movement to merge all small political parties into a new, all-powerful party has failed. However, the Social Masses Party, which holds 30 seats in the House of Representatives, and the Johokai, which holds 12 seats, merged today. The former is one of Japan's proletarian parties, while the latter is organized by conservatives and extreme right-wing elements. If the new party is formed according to the policy set by its initiators, it will hold 70 seats in the House of Representatives (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Spokesman Explains Reason for Detaining British Ship</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a Japanese naval spokesman today, British ships often transport military supplies to various Chinese ports, the purpose of which is obviously to undermine the effectiveness of the Japanese navy's blockade of Chinese ports. The Japanese spokesman's remarks were made in response to the British warship HMS "Birmingham" rescuing a certain British ship and said that Japan believes that this incident should be noted. According to the spokesman, among the British ships that were escorted to Qingdao by the Japanese navy last week, many of the items carried were gasoline and military supplies, obviously to supply the Chinese army (Associated Press, 9th).</p>
<h3>Belgian Cabinet Resigns</h3>
<p>Brussels: The Pierlot cabinet submitted its resignation to the King today (Havas, 9th).</p>
<p>Brussels: After the government appointed Dr. Maerten as a member of the Flemish Medical Research Institute earlier this month, the Liberal Party strongly opposed it. The cabinet members belonging to the party also stated that if Dr. Maerten did not resign voluntarily, they would withdraw from the cabinet. In view of the attitude of these cabinet members, Prime Minister Pierlot realized that he could no longer continue to serve and submitted his resignation to the King. Prime Minister Spaak had previously reorganized his cabinet in part on the 10th of last month due to opposition from some members of the Socialist Party regarding the dispatch of a representative to the city of Burgos, Spain, only two weeks ago (Havas, 9th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarine Collision Sinks; Only Six Survivors</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Navy Rear Admiral Kanazawa told foreign reporters today that the official investigation into the sinking of the submarine I-63 on February 2 due to a collision between two submarines is still ongoing. The results will be announced within a few days. It is likely that all 81 people trapped inside the submarine have no hope of survival. Kanazawa declined to provide details on the escape of the six survivors, saying that rescue work is currently underway, but it is being hampered by the very rapid currents in the area and the fact that the submarine sank 100 meters below the surface. It is said that the accident occurred before dawn when it was still dark and foggy (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>Chinese Air Force Continues to Strengthen</h3>

Regarding anti-smoking, the cultivation of tobacco throughout the province was banned last year, and smoking is now being banned. The provincial government stipulates that all smokers under the age of 35 must quit smoking by the end of June this year, and anti-smoking centers have been established in various counties to conduct anti-smoking campaigns on a regular basis, with the aim of completing the province-wide ban on smoking within the next two years (Telegram, 8th).</p>

<h3>Promoting Rear Area Construction: Guiyang Today - Expanding Telecommunications, Promoting Domestic Culture, and Increasingly Developed Finance</h3>
<p>Since the rise of the military, Guizhou has become the center of economic transportation in the southwest, and Guiyang, as the local gazetteer says, occupies the central position in the province, a hub connecting roads in all directions, and the economic and transportation hub of Guizhou Province. Guizhou has always been known as a mountain country; Guiyang is a relatively large plain in the mountains, bordering the Nanming River to the north. The city circumference is less than ten kilometers, forming an irregular ellipse. Walking at a leisurely pace, from east to west gate, it takes only twenty minutes to cross, and the north-south distance is longer, but only twice the east-west distance. Therefore, among the provincial capitals in the country, it is considered one of the smallest. Outside the city are famous scenic spots such as Qianling Mountain, East Mountain, and Guanyin Cave. It is said that Guanyin Cave can connect to Duyun, two hundred li away in the southeast. This is ultimately just a legend. The climate has no intense heat or severe cold, but the changes in temperature are perhaps second only to Kunming. It has this characteristic: as long as there is sunshine, even in the depths of winter, it can feel like early spring; and in the sweltering heat, with cloud cover, one can wear a jacket. Qianzhong was originally an area inhabited by both Han Chinese and Miao people. In Guiyang, the Miao people also account for twenty to thirty percent of the population, but apart from still wearing short clothes and floral skirts, going barefoot, wrapping their hair, and liking to wear silver ornaments, most of their matchmaking and marriage customs have followed Han customs, and they can communicate in Mandarin when interacting with the local people. The language used here is generally Sichuan Mandarin and Hunan Mandarin, but since this is a great migration of people from the coastal provinces, the accents of the Jiangnan region can be heard everywhere. I would like to report on other aspects separately, so that it can be more coherent.</p>
<p>Refreshing the City Appearance: In the past, due to years of war and financial poverty, the construction of the city streets was somewhat poor. Recently, the Guiyang Municipal Engineering Office of the Construction Department has actively improved the city streets, and there has been significant progress in the sanitation of the streets and the tidiness of the city appearance. Since 1928, the houses on both sides of the road have been limited to three-story Western-style buildings with facades, and there are prominent covered walkways on the sidewalks. The most prosperous section of the city is "Dashizi" (Great Crossroads), similar to Nanjing Road in Shanghai and Bajiating in Changsha. As for the so-called Western-style buildings, due to the difficulty of transporting steel and cement, this expense was spared, and only brick and wood were used, plastered with lime on the outside. Even the newly completed Bank of Communications, which looks quite impressive, is no exception. The main roads are quite wide, but the road surface is neither asphalt nor cobblestone, but muddy ground, which becomes extremely muddy after rain. It is currently being renovated with great effort. Also, due to the rapid increase in population and frequent traffic, in order to facilitate traffic and facilitate evacuation during air raids, seven or eight new city gates have been added, and a new residential area has been demarcated in the Nanming River loop. According to recent statistics, the city's population has reached over 140,000, and there are still more coming in. In view of the tragic bombing of Guilin last month, the authorities are planning to evacuate women, children, the elderly, and those who do not need to stay in the city in advance. At night, the power plant generates electricity, but the amount of electricity is too small to meet the demand. Except for the main streets, most of the small streets and alleys have no streetlights. Starting this year, the provincial government is cooperating with the Resources Committee to convert the power plant into the Guiyang Power Plant, expanding the power to 1200 kilowatts. All the machinery will be installed, so that in about two months, it can shine brightly.</p>
<p>Balancing Prices: Due to the unprecedented expansion of consumption, all industries seem to have a healthy glow, and the scene of shoulders rubbing and heels bumping under the electric lights looks very prosperous, much like a beggar in rags wearing a gorgeous cloak. However, the superficial luxury cannot conceal the internal poverty. Rice has risen to twenty-two yuan per dan, and sugar, salt, and daily necessities are also rising daily. Although green vegetables can sell for a good price of one mao per head, the gains do not outweigh the losses. The cost-of-living index, published monthly in the newspapers, has increased by two times compared to before the war. The local citizens are struggling to breathe under the pressure of this consumption that has jumped over a century. People who have fled from other provinces are also complaining. The housing shortage is no less than that in the Shanghai Concession. A small house that could be rented for seven or eight yuan a year in the past cannot be rented for ten yuan a month now. As a result, vacant land is being used to build houses frantically, and timber prices are soaring. A package of Wudi toothpaste costs one mao, and a bar of Guben medicated soap costs four mao. Towels, toothbrushes, and other items are even more expensive. The same items are three times more expensive than in Shanghai and Guangzhou. Therefore, balancing prices and strictly prohibiting speculation has become the most troublesome task for the authorities. The most prosperous businesses are restaurants and hotels. No fewer than seven or eight new restaurants have emerged, with Su-Xi boat dishes and Jiangnan flavors such as Yangzi Restaurant, Siwuliu Restaurant, and Pingjin cuisine such as Guduchun. Cantonese cuisine includes Sihai Restaurant. In short, regardless of Yunnan or Sichuan flavors, the seats are always full, and waiting an hour for dinner is not a rare occurrence. The most famous hotels include the Far East Hotel, Jiangnan Hotel, and Paris Hotel. The barber business is also doing well. Xuan Palace Barber Shop should be the most beautifully equipped and decorated. A haircut costs four mao, a shampoo costs one mao, and a blow-dry costs another mao, so a haircut costs six mao. Most of its customers are from the Jiangnan region. It is worth mentioning that the China National Products Company opened on New Year's Day this year, with a capital of 100,000 yuan, of which 60,000 yuan was invested by the China National Products Joint Venture Company, and the provincial government also invested 10,000 yuan. This is equivalent to a national products production and marketing cooperation organization, and its future has unlimited development prospects.</p>
<p>Establishing Factories: Guizhou is not like other inland provinces, with special currency systems and banknotes issued by local banks. It has long used legal tender. In the past, there were several banks in Guiyang: Central, China Farmers, and Shanghai. Later, the Jin City Bank was added. This year, the China Bank and the Bank of Communications successively established branches, so the four legal tender banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture are all present, which will undoubtedly make the finance of the entire Guizhou more active. Apart from a few match-making grass industries, there is only the model factory that should be built. Recently, in view of the increasing number of refugees coming to Guizhou, in order to enable the refugees to engage in production and increase national strength, the provincial government is also preparing to set up simple handicraft relief factories in Guiyang, and large-scale cement plants and oil presses are also being planned.</p>
<p>Education and Culture: There are specialized schools and above, including the National Guiyang Medical College, Shanghai Daxia University, Jiangsu Medical College, and Xiangya Medical College, which recently moved from Changsha. There are fifteen middle schools, including Daxia Middle School, Provincial Senior High School, Guiyang Middle School, Normal School, Girls' Normal School, and Zhongda Shizhong. There are twenty-two primary schools, of which girls' primary schools account for eight. A city with a radius of ten kilometers has so many schools, which is not a small number. So, in all honesty, Guizhou has fewer illiterate people than imagined. An ordinary manual worker can almost read the wall newspapers, and women's education is particularly developed. The China-Soviet Cultural Association also has a branch in Guiyang, with more than 500 members. The president is Wang Bocui, and the directors are Zhang Zhihan and Guo Yicen. They are making the greatest efforts to promote Sino-Soviet culture, and have first established a Russian language school. It cannot be denied that the literary and artistic movement is much quieter than in Chongqing, Kunming, and Guilin. However, recently, cultural figures have proposed "strengthening the cultural front and developing Guizhou culture" and organizing the Guizhou Cultural Association, which has high hopes for establishing a brand-new literary and artistic foundation in Guizhou.

<h3>Hua Army in Northern Jiangsu Rectifies Discipline, Commissioners of Four Districts Replaced</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The General Headquarters of the X Guerrilla Zone in Northern Jiangsu, in order to rectify the military discipline of various troops and to investigate whether the various troops are earnestly implementing the ban on collecting donations at the blocked ports, has specially organized an inspection team to conduct inspections. All the members of the team are officers above the rank of major. The headquarters also reported that in the Shizhuang battle in Rugao last month, the Second Security Regiment fought bravely and killed many Japanese soldiers. The regiment also suffered casualties, including Li Deben and Zhang Hanqing, and about twenty others were killed, and three were injured. In order to comfort the families of the fallen soldiers of the regiment, special permission has been granted to provide preferential treatment to comfort the loyal souls. Lu Daijun, the magistrate of Jiangdu County, has resigned, and the provincial government has instructed him to transfer to another position. The vacancy will be filled by Zhang Jichuan. In addition, Zhang, the administrative inspector and district security commander of the Fourth District, resigned from his post due to his busy military affairs and inability to take care of both responsibilities. The provincial government has appointed Wu Chunke to succeed him.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Sanyu Town Suffer Damage and Retreat</h3>
<p>Nantong Correspondence: The Japanese troops stationed in Sijiaba, gathered about 500 people from various places such as Jinsha, and were equipped with three 75mm steel cannons, two mortars, four 53mm small steel cannons, three or four heavy machine guns, and twenty or so light machine guns. They advanced towards the positions of the Chinese army along the Sanyu-Sijiaba River at dawn on January 21. The provincial security Xu Battalion stationed in Sanyu immediately reported the information and, led by Battalion Commander Jin Cheng, personally led his troops to meet the enemy. At 4:15 AM, contact was made about half a mile south of Sanyu Town. The Japanese army launched its main force towards the east end of Sanyu Town. By 6:00 AM, the Japanese troops were facing off against the Chinese army across the river, fighting with hand grenades. The fierce battle lasted until 6:00 PM, and the Japanese army had not yet retreated. The Japanese troops who were blocked and attacked on the right wing of Sanyu Town had been surrounded by the Chinese army, and had not broken out by 6:00 PM. Zhang Xingbing, the commander of the security regiment, personally went to the front to supervise the battle and ordered Zhang Battalion to advance towards Sanyu from the west, detouring to attack the Japanese army. The Japanese army fired more than 400 shells throughout the day. After holding out until the afternoon, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the heavy casualties and retreated. The next morning, the Chinese army searched forward and captured a flag and eight rifles in the Japanese army's position. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 200 casualties and three officers were killed. The Chinese army also suffered more than 30 casualties.</p>
<h3>Bandits Loot Zhouzhuang</h3>
<p>Wujiang Correspondence: The area of Wuxian and Wujiang has become a den of thieves since the incident, and the people are not living in peace. Zhouzhuang Town, southeast of Wuxian, has always been known for its prosperity. On the 3rd of this month, seventeen bandit boats came from the direction of Beiku, carrying more than 200 bandits, equipped with rifles and machine guns. The boats docked at Jubaobao Bridge and lined up to Zhouzhuang. First, a bandit leader went to Changyuan in the middle of the market street to drink tea and extort 10,000 yuan from the local merchants. As a result, the town reluctantly scraped together 3,000 yuan. The bandits were not satisfied and ordered a robbery after receiving the money. No shop or household in the entire town was spared. The heaviest losses were suffered by Gongzheng Tea and Food Store, Dai Yongmao Silk and Cloth Store, Tiansheng Cloth Store, Dewu Rice Store, Tongfeng Rice Store, Hemao Tobacco Store, Yuanfengsheng Sauce Garden, Lu Dongxing Local Goods Store, and others, amounting to tens of thousands. After robbing Zhouzhuang, the bandits went to Jinjiaba to loot on a large scale. According to the report, Zhouzhuang has been robbed five times so far, and this time the losses were the most severe.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Harass Daqiao, Attempted Landing Foiled</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: On the night of February 1st, at about 4:00 AM, two shallow-draft warships from Yangzhou came from the Japanese army. After passing Sanjiangying, they sailed into the Zhongzha River and docked. The warships were equipped with more than 300 Japanese soldiers. At dawn, they opened fire to cover an attempted landing and invasion of Daqiao. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese army immediately sent a team to the southern bank of Zhongzha to block the attack with machine gun fire. After two hours of fierce fighting, the warships escaped downstream. At the same time, about 60 Japanese soldiers from the direction of Xiannv Temple, carrying two machine guns, advanced towards Zhangwanggou. When the fierce battle stopped, the batch of Japanese soldiers retreated from Zhongzha back to Xiannv Temple.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Hangzhou Hastily Build Defenses</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The Japanese troops in Hangzhou, believing that the Chinese army was powerful and approaching the suburbs of the city, ordered the puppet provincial government to order the puppet police to conscript laborers everywhere to build strong defense works. Cannons were placed on the high mountains such as Phoenix Mountain, Yuhuang Mountain, and Maiyun Mountain. Sandbags and electric fences were piled up according to the terrain of the city and mountains. A puppet Zhejiang Peace Committee was also organized, with Watanabe, the head of the Japanese special service agency, as the secretary-general, and all the large and small puppets in Hangzhou as members.</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization in Haining Forcibly Forces Strong Men to Build Roads</h3>
<p>Xiashi Correspondence: The puppet magistrate of Haining recently ordered the construction of the Xia (Xiashi)-Chang (Changan) Highway in accordance with Japanese orders. The puppet magistrate is ordering the chiefs of various towns and villages to forward the orders to their subordinates to compile a list of strong men and send them to work in batches. He is also stipulating the method of service. If a strong man is sick or has something to do and cannot serve, he must pay a substitute service fee of one yuan per day, including food costs. If someone resists the service for no reason, he will be arrested and fined, and also punished with a fine. It is reported that the project is scheduled to begin in the middle of this month, but at that time it is feared that it will proceed slowly, because the section of the road to be designated is all controlled by the Chinese army.</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Forcibly Occupies British Zhen Tai Yarn Factory, Although British Authorities Allowed to Inspect, Date of Return Unknown</h3>
<p>The China Textile Industry Corporation convened a meeting yesterday, in which it presented a report stating that the British Zhen Tai Textile Factory on the Suzhou River was forcibly occupied by the Shanghai Japanese army in December of last year, and was later transferred to a Japanese yarn factory under the name of Qingniao, and is still in Japanese hands to this day, without being returned. The chairman of the meeting, Gao Mosaier, stated that the Japanese side must believe that the British authorities cannot protect the property of British expatriates. It is truly regrettable that we still do not have the right to use the yarn factory to this day. To this day, the Japanese side still has no concrete statement.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese-language *North China Daily News*: The China Textile Co., Ltd. held its second annual meeting at 88 Museum Road yesterday (the 8th). According to reports at the meeting, the Zhen Tai Yarn Factory (transliteration) owned by the company was located near St. John's University on the Suzhou River. In December 1937, it was seized by the Japanese army, and then the Japanese army transferred the factory to the Japanese Toyo Yarn Factory. According to Chairman Goma Sel, the situation is slightly better than last year, as the Japanese authorities have allowed the British authorities to inspect the factory in order to ascertain the state of the property. Mr. Go also reported to the shareholders that because the factory has not started work, there are no profit and loss accounts. It is still remembered that the factory was seized by the Japanese army in December of the year before last, and then handed over to the Toyo Yarn Factory. In July of last year, a special meeting of shareholders was convened to formally report this matter and request all shareholders to protest through their respective consulates. Since then, we have been in constant contact with the British authorities. The Japanese authorities then allowed the British authorities to inspect the factory, so British consular staff and others went to inspect it twice. The British Consulate has repeatedly protested, demanding that the factory be returned to us. The British Embassy in Japan has also protested. Therefore, we will soon be able to regain the factory.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Intercepted at the Upper-Chuansha Border</h3>
<p>Two Hours of Daytime Fighting</p>
<p>Passengers on the Upper-Chuansha Road Disappear</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday, another guerrilla battle took place in the countryside near Lujiahang on the Upper-Chuansha border in Pudong. A Japanese army unit, led by a puppet "army," was conducting a search when it was intercepted and attacked by the Chinese army. Both sides used machine guns and rifles. Because it was daytime, the battle lasted for two hours. The Chinese army completed its attrition strategy and retreated at 1:00 PM. When the battle was taking place, the situation along the Upper-Chuansha Road was quite tense and passengers disappeared. After the battle subsided, the Japanese army continued to search in various villages, but because the Chinese army acted unpredictably, they found nothing.</p>
<h3>Hexing Town Repeatedly Bombed, Shipping Disrupted</h3>
<p>Letter from Hexing Business Firm</p>
<p>Hoping Foreign Ships Do Not Enter Port</p>
<p>Hexing Town in Funing has recently been bombed repeatedly by Japanese aircraft. Last time, three foreign transport ships carrying goods were seized by Japanese warships and sailed to Qingdao. Later, the authorities of the respective countries sent warships to protect them, and they were able to risk returning. Afterwards, the foreign transport ships changed their routes and sailed to other routes. The navigational markers at the mouth of the Sheyang River (ie, Yanghekou) were removed by Japanese warships, and local pilots fled, making it even more difficult for ships to pass. According to a telegram from Chen Boming of the Hexing Town Ning Qinghexiang Shenzhuang yesterday, Hexing Town has been bombed repeatedly, and foreign merchant ships should not enter the port. In this situation, the Hexing route will be difficult to resume for a while. It is reported that there are no garrison troops in the area, and the Japanese bombing is just wasting ammunition.</p>
<h3>British Warship Escorts Merchant Ship to Safety</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, according to news revealed in the local area today, the British escort ship HMS Wren, following the precedent of the British cruiser HMS Birmingham sailing from Weihaiwei to Qingdao to rescue the Yongmai, yesterday (the 8th) also sailed from Weihaiwei to Yantai because two of the Jardine Matheson's transport ships were detained. The two ships detained were the Mingsheng and Desheng. They were blocked at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday and were unable to set sail. The Desheng was released at midnight and sailed out. At noon the next day, HMS Wren arrived at Yantai from Weihaiwei and immediately ordered the Mingsheng to set sail. The ship is still docked in Yantai, and its commander is continuing to investigate the delay caused by the detention of the two ships. It is believed that the Japanese side's answer will be to inspect the passenger list of the two ships.</p>
<h3>Merchants from Various Industries Telegraph to Request Slowdown of Ban on Shipping Local Goods to Shanghai, Shanghai Concession Cannot Be Controlled by the Japanese, Please Give Consideration to Merchants' Difficulties During the General Termination Period</h3>
<p>After the customs of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces were ordered to ban the shipment of 54 kinds of local goods, such as tung oil, to Shanghai, various industries telegraphed to call for relief. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the petitions from the raw lacquer and egg industries, etc., telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, as well as the military and political authorities of Zhejiang, to allow the release of the goods. The Trade Commission was ordered to formulate measures and allocate funds to purchase the goods to avoid obstruction of local goods and affect the livelihood of farmers and merchants. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Obstruction of Local Goods, Telegraph Calls for Relief: Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs designated 54 kinds of goods, such as tung oil, eggs, tea, wood, casings, raw lacquer, and paper, and banned their shipment to Japan and its colonies or mandated territories, and areas controlled by Japanese violence, Shanghai, as a occupied area, the customs of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces immediately ordered a ban on shipment to Shanghai. The various industries of cotton, paper, eggs, tea, wood, etc. in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, were affected because once the ban was implemented, the goods purchased by merchants were detained by the customs in various places and were not allowed to be released. Local goods piled up in Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Fujian, and could not be shipped to Shanghai, which greatly affected the livelihood of farmers and merchants, all telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the provincial authorities, requesting consideration of the difficulties of merchants and allowing the release of the goods.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs to Request Release of Local Goods: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the commerce of Shanghai has always been concentrated in the concession area. After the National Army retreated to the west, the commerce in Nanshi and Zhabei all tried to move to the safe area of the concession to operate. After the Raw Lacquer Industry Association previously requested that the Ministry of Economic Affairs be requested to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to order the customs to release the goods to maintain the circulation of goods, it received a request from the Egg Industry Association yesterday, stating that the industry mainly focuses on retail sales and the manufacture of colored eggs, etc., and the source mainly relies on the Oujiang, Jiaojiang, and Yongjiang ports in eastern Zhejiang. Now that the government has ordered a ban on shipment to Shanghai, it is difficult to maintain business, and thousands of employees are at risk of unemployment. Please telegraph the military and political authorities of eastern Zhejiang to allow the release of fresh eggs to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Various Places Continue to Telegraph Request for Slowdown of Ban: Various chambers of commerce have telegraphed the government to request a slowdown of the ban. The telegram from the Yuyao Chamber of Commerce to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Customs Supervision Office stated that the Zhejiang Customs reported that the Ministry of Finance ordered that 54 kinds of products, such as cotton and tea, should be banned from export. The amount of cotton and other products produced in the county is very large and has always been supplied for export. Not only does the entire county rely on it for financing and turnover, but also the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of merchants and farmers is maintained by this. Once the ban is implemented, it will cause the entire county's commerce to stagnate and the economy to collapse. Moreover, the Shanghai Concession is still managed by the concession authorities, which is different from the prohibited areas that have been controlled by Japanese violence. The chamber believes that at the time when commerce is generally terminated, in order to maintain the financial stability of the commercial market and stabilize the morale of the rear, the ban should be slowed down to benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Formulate Measures and Allocate Funds to Purchase: The New Voice News reporter learned from relevant parties yesterday that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have jointly decided that after the ban on the shipment of 54 kinds of local goods, if they are local bulk products and the sales channels are blocked, affecting the people's livelihood, the Trade Commission has been ordered to order the Agricultural Bank and others to allocate funds to purchase them as much as possible. It is reported that the Zhejiang Office of the Trade Commission has entrusted the Central Trust Bureau, China Tea Company, etc. to contact various industries such as tung oil and tea to negotiate purchases, and the Trade Commission has negotiated with British-American Tobacco and Jardine Matheson to arrange for the two companies to send special ships to transport the goods to Hong Kong, where they will be concentrated and then exported.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Rewards Machine-Made Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Announces Various Regulations</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently revised the procedures for manufacturers to apply for taxes on machine-made foreign-style goods in accordance with the current regulations. All machine factories in the city that have been approved for registration and use machines to imitate foreign-style goods should follow the procedures to apply for paying taxes in accordance with the current regulations for machine-made foreign-style goods. For the convenience of reference, the five procedures, together with the ten regulations for paying taxes on machine goods, and the twenty-nine articles of the Provisional Regulations on Encouraging Industrial Technology and the twenty-eight articles of the implementing rules, have been published in full in the first issue of this year's Commercial Daily.</p>
<h3>Large Amounts of Counterfeit Money Transported to Shanghai for Mixing and Sale, Customs Strictly Investigating, Printing Color is No Different from Genuine Money, Edge is Slightly Wider, Can Be Distinguished After Careful Inspection</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs recently received a secret report that a certain party is printing a large number of counterfeit banknotes in its country to disrupt my country's finances, and is transporting them to Shanghai for mixing and sale. A small number of these counterfeit banknotes have been discovered in the market. It is reported that the printing color is exquisite and carefully researched, and there is no difference from genuine money. However, the edge of the paper is slightly larger, there is too much blank space, and the lines are also rougher. Therefore, once carefully identified, the authenticity can be detected. It is also reported that the quantity of these counterfeit banknotes that have been imported in recent days is very large. The customs authorities have ordered strict investigation and suppression to prevent them from circulating in the market and affecting the currency system. Several cases have been solved. At the same time, the banking sector has also paid attention to this.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Regime Again Inventing Names to Impose a "Goods Entering Tax"; Puppet Official in Hupu Embezzles Funds and Flees; Japanese Side Refuses Import of Chinese and Foreign Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Within the areas they occupy, the Japanese and puppet regimes exhaust all methods to plunder the economy. The types of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies number no fewer than dozens. Recently, they have cleverly invented a new name, increasing the "Goods Entering Tax." A puppet official at the Hupu Japanese-puppet tax collection agency engaged in massive embezzlement, absconding with a huge sum. Details are reported below:</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Regime Imposes Another "Goods Entering Tax" The Japanese and puppet regime, at various river ports seized through violence, have stationed Japanese troops and puppet police to handle tax collection matters. All kinds of goods, no matter how large or small, are subject to taxes. The categories are numerous, no fewer than dozens. Ordinary merchants and people, under this oppressive duress, are crying out in misery. After the Japanese and puppet regime began levying the "Goods Exiting Tax" on December 10th of last year, only two months have passed, and it has already become unbearable for merchants. Unexpectedly, they have recently increased the "Goods Entering Tax," establishing harsh regulations to extract a percentage of the goods' value, scheduled to be implemented on the 15th of this month. This shows how the Japanese and puppet regime schemes to extort money and plunder the economy, intending to drive our people to their deaths.</p>
<p>Puppet Official Embezzles Funds and Flees Hupu Port is a central port for commerce after the war. The goods entering and exiting daily amount to hundreds of thousands, with daily tax revenues amounting to a substantial seven or eight thousand yuan. Therefore, the puppet organization specifically established a "Tax Collection Office" at the port, appointing Zhang Younan as "Director" to handle various tax collections. Within a few months, this puppet official and others colluded to embezzle funds, underreporting the amount collected under the "Transit Tax" category, embezzling over two hundred thousand yuan. This matter was discovered by the Japanese and puppet authorities, who immediately dispatched Japanese and puppet troops to surround the "Tax Collection Office." Unexpectedly, the puppet officials had already gotten wind of it and fled, also taking the remaining twenty thousand yuan of tax money in the iron safe when they left. All tax receipt ledgers and other counterfeit documents were set ablaze.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Yarn Refused Import The Japanese side, aiming to monopolize the mainland cotton yarn market, has imposed strict restrictions on yarn produced by Chinese and foreign factories. Recently, the Japanese puppet regime has refused to allow any non-Japanese yarn to be unloaded at riverside ports. Earlier this month, several hundred pieces of yarn (a portion of which was Japanese yarn) were detained and have not yet been released. Therefore, various merchants and factories are jointly negotiating, while also finding ways to modify vehicles to transport goods inland.</p>
<h3>Passports to Yunnan via Vietnam Issued with Utmost Care</h3>
<p>Preventing Traitors from Entering the Country</p>
<p>In order to strictly prevent traitors from engaging in activities and undermining the united resistance efforts in Yunnan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the visa office in Hong Kong to carefully verify the identity and profession of Chinese citizens applying for passports to enter Yunnan via Vietnam. Particular attention should be paid to the guarantee aspect. Simultaneously, the central government has established a passenger entry inspection station in the Chinese area near Haiphong to strictly inspect passengers. Even those with passports must undergo thorough inspection before being allowed to pass. If there is any suspicion or unclear background, they must find a reliable shop in Haiphong to guarantee them before being allowed to enter the country. As for Chinese citizens going to Burma, the Burmese government has announced that all Chinese traveling to Burma, regardless of origin, must have a formal passport, and temporary certificates will no longer be recognized as valid. This formal passport can be issued by the Hong Kong Foreign Affairs Office, and according to Burmese government passport regulations, the passport holder must sign and affix a thumbprint for verification to avoid future difficulties due to non-compliance with procedures.</p>
<h3>"Tuo Hu" Rickshaw Association Announces: Negotiations for Improving Rickshaws; Rickshaw Pullers Begin Paying Licenses; Police Release Impounded Rickshaws; Association Expresses Gratitude to Ratepayers' Association and Chinese Directors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Market Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association's members' rickshaws, regarding the request for an extension to improve vehicles, has now been resolved. Various police stations have begun releasing impounded rickshaws. Rickshaws without licenses have begun paying for licenses and operating since yesterday. The Mutual Aid Association has announced the negotiation process and expressed gratitude to the Chinese directors. Details are reported separately below:</p>
<p>Start Paying Licenses The rickshaws of the "Tuo Hu" Rickshaw Association members, due to economic difficulties and inability to improve vehicles, have been resolved after mediation by the Public Works Department's Chinese Director Xi Yushu and others. Improvements must be completed by July 1st of this year. Rickshaw pullers have already begun paying for spring licenses at the Gordon Road verification office yesterday, based on multiple-season licenses, and redeeming impounded rickshaws from various police stations based on the paid licenses. Except for the impounded rickshaws at the Old Gate police station, which were released the night before, the remaining police stations in New Gate, Hui Shi, Jing'an Temple, etc., also began releasing impounded rickshaws yesterday.</p>
<p>Expressing Gratitude to Chinese Directors The Market Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association, representing member rickshaw pullers, expresses gratitude to the Public Works Department's Chinese directors and the Ratepayers' Association, saying: "We respectfully report that this time, our members' rickshaws, due to economic difficulties, were unable to comply with the Public Works Department's current regulations to immediately improve vehicles. We are grateful for your Association's (Directors) sympathy and mediation, which allowed for an extension to implement the improvements. We are extremely grateful. In addition to supervising members to proceed according to the negotiated resolution, we are sending this letter to express our gratitude. Please take note."</p>
<p>Negotiation Process The Shanghai Market Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association announced the negotiation process for improving vehicles, stating: "Previously, our association received reports from 'Tuo Hu' rickshaw operators that the Public Works Department's sudden order to shorten the rickshaw handles and modify the two-hour iron wheels hindered work, affected livelihoods, and made the wheel modification costs unbearable. We requested a reasonable negotiation with the Public Works Department, which was resolved by our association's letter to the Public Concession Ratepayers' Association and Public Works Department Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and others. The solution is as follows: 1. The improvement of vehicles will be supervised by our association for all members to implement, completing the improvements by July 1st of this year. 2. Impounded vehicles will be released by the police stations upon notification by the Public Works Department. 3. Vehicles without licenses can be exempt from verification and pay for the spring license with the winter license. Our association has decided to implement the vehicle improvement plan starting March 1st. All our 'Tuo Hu' rickshaw operators, regardless of whether they have registered with our association, are requested to bring their vehicles to our association (address: 24, Lane 290, Guizhou Road, Beijing Road) for registration, so that we can compile statistics and improve them uniformly. For impoverished operators who cannot afford the cost of modifying the wheel edges, our association will provide loans. This matter concerns the vital interests of our operators. We hope you will register with our association promptly to facilitate improvements and avoid being penalized for violating regulations after the deadline."</p>
<p>Truth of Mediation Another report states that the Public Works Department's Chinese directors, regarding the rickshaw wheel modification case, believe that the Public Works Department's actions are based on a resolution and are not open to criticism. However, the rickshaw pullers are experiencing economic difficulties and cannot afford to modify their vehicles immediately. Therefore, during mediation, they only requested an extension to allow rickshaw pullers time to prepare. Also, before this case was resolved, Chinese Director Xi Yushu had discussed the matter with the bureau several times. The gathering of all Chinese directors for a discussion is not factual.</p>
<h3>British Military Commander Returning Home Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Renovation of Hongkou Buildings Not Yet Completed</h3>
<p>Some Have Been Repaired</p>
<p>The Rest Are Being Rushed</p>
<p>According to a Public Works Department source, the various public works buildings in Hongkou have suffered severe damage in the war. These include the park warden's dormitory in Hongkou Park, the sanitation branch in the Huishan vegetable market, and the Public Works Department factory on Yuezhou Road, all of which have now been repaired and completed. Others, such as the Northern District sewer disposal facility, the Peng Road Chinese-Italian Elementary School, the Public and Hanbury Girls' School, and the Ward Road Prison Hospital, are still under repair.</p>

<h3>Gandhi, Tagore, etc., Sympathize with China's Resistance; Say China Will Certainly Win the Final Victory; All of India Is Now Striving to Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Mr. Wu and Mr. Cai (both transliterated), of the National Committee of the Chinese Youth Association, returned to Shanghai from India last week as Chinese delegates to the World Christian Conference. Yesterday (the 8th), they told reporters that India's three giants are wholeheartedly supporting China's resistance. These three are the world-renowned:</p>
<p>Indian Patriots Gandhi, the initiator of non-cooperation with Britain and Nehru, who served two terms as chairman of the All-India National Congress, is worshipped by at least 90% of the Indian people, and the world-renowned poet Tagore. Several Chinese delegates attending the conference visited these three leaders in December. First, they visited Gandhi in Sevagram, and then went to Santiniketan, not far from Calcutta, where Tagore established his major works.</p>
<p>Then They Went to Bombay to visit Nehru. Although Gandhi has always advocated moderation, he told the Chinese delegates that in special circumstances, assisting with atrocities is not necessarily a wrong thing to do. He also said that since he began working for political independence in India, he had assisted the British government, its enemy, during the war. During the Boer War in South Africa and World War I, he organized stretcher teams and first aid groups.</p>
<p>Serving in the British Army He does not regret this, believing that this move could win the sympathy of the British people, Gandhi is quite healthy and often lives in a small village called Ashram for recuperation. The exchange of views between the Chinese delegates and Tagore focused on cultural aspects, but Tagore also expressed sympathy for China's resistance. His attitude towards the Sino-Japanese War is clearly expressed in his letter to a Japanese poet. Tagore's letter</p>
<p>Says Japanese Warlords are like madmen, destroying civilization. I know that once the Japanese people wake up, they will have to rebuild their civilization. China cannot be conquered. Under the indomitable leadership of Chairman Chiang, Chinese civilization has shown its amazing development, the people's oath of allegiance, and the unprecedented spiritual unity. A new era is being established there. Temporary setbacks cannot destroy its complete</p>
<p>Awakened Spirit Speaking to Nehru, the Chinese delegates could see the extent of India's sympathy for China's struggle. Mr. Nehru repeatedly told the delegates that India wanted to do more for China and provide China with material assistance. India's important political party, the All-India National Congress, passed two important resolutions favorable to China: one</p>
<p>Was to condemn Japan's "aggression" against China, and the second was to pass a measure boycotting Japanese goods in India. The National Congress is now exerting all its efforts to implement the second resolution. Mr. Nehru sent two types of written appeals to the Chinese delegates: one a letter to the people and one a letter to Chinese students, which recalled the long history of Chinese and Indian culture and civilization, and stated the certainty of China's victory in the resistance, hoping that the Chinese and Indian people would cooperate closely.</p>
<h3>Famous Chinese and Foreign Journalists Receive Threatening Letters; Even "Sentencing to Death" Is Used as Intimidation; Everyone Knows the Purpose Behind This</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that a certain journalist in Shanghai has received a threatening letter from the "Most Upright and Genuine Chinese Association," stating that a large number of Chinese and foreign male and female journalists in Shanghai will be put to death. The letter stated that they have all been "sentenced to death" and the recipient of the letter is one of them. Whether this is a prank is unknown. If it is a prank, then it is an extremely clumsy one. Otherwise, this is a particularly serious matter. The Public Concession Police Department is currently investigating. Among those threatened is Mr. Alcott, a reporter for the Greater Shanghai Radio Station, whose offense is described as "lying as much as possible twice a day." Mr. Gault and Mr. Ford of the Greater Shanghai Evening Post "lie every day," Mr. Powell and Mr. Gui Zhongshu of the China Weekly Review, "lie once a week," Miss Smedley, Mr. Tilman and Mr. Farnsworth "write books full of lies," and Mr. Fei Shi "runs Chinese newspapers full of lies." The letter lists a total of thirteen people, one of whom is the owner of the Commercial Press and several other Chinese people. In short, the intimidators have compiled a list of those who publish news and opinions sympathetic to China. This kind of news and opinion is clearly not in line with the political views of the "Upright Chinese," or perhaps these people are not human, or perhaps these people can be identified as the New Asia Hotel terrorists who disturbed Shanghai's security last year.</p>
<h3>American Warship Monocacy Sinks in Chinese Waters; Decommissioned Due to Old Age</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the old gunboat Monocacy of the U.S. Navy's Yangtze River Patrol will be sunk in Chinese waters today (the 9th) due to old age. At approximately 10:00 this morning, the ship, carrying Navy Lieutenant Commander Ranna and two sailors, was towed to the deep sea off Ma'anshan Island. Ranna and the two sailors entered the bottom of the ship, opened the drain pipes and suction valves, and then left the ship and entered the tugboat, allowing the turbid waters of the Chinese sea to pour into the ship. It is expected that the Monocacy will sink within minutes. Two other old American ships, the Villalobos and the Quiros, which served in the Far East for many years, are also anchored in the sea nearby and will also be sunk in Chinese waters. The Monocacy was built in San Francisco Bay in 1914 and then sailed to Shanghai to be assigned to the U.S. Navy, serving in various rivers of China for 24 years. Monocacy is the name of an American river, and the warship now being sunk is the second American ship to bear this name.</p>
<h3>Assessing Commodity Prices; Suppressing Speculation</h3>
<p>Price Assessment Associations Established Everywhere</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Merchants and People from Raising Prices and Taking Advantage</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Economic Affairs formulated measures for assessing commodity prices and suppressing speculation and manipulation in extraordinary times, provinces, cities, and counties were ordered to organize price assessment committees, stipulating that all commodities within their jurisdiction must be sold in accordance with the assessed prices in order to stabilize commodity prices and people's livelihoods. Now Zhejiang Province and other places have found that a few cunning merchants, blinded by greed, disregard everything else, and often violate the assessed prices of the Price Assessment Committee in covert ways, selling inferior goods at high prices and taking advantage for profit. The unscrupulous merchants are truly insufficient, and the common people suffer greatly. This kind of exploitation is truly heartbreaking. In addition to sending personnel to secretly investigate from time to time, the prefectural government also ordered various counties to instruct police stations, offices, and township public offices to pay close attention. If various shops are found to be taking advantage for profit and violating the assessed price situation again, they should be reported to the prefectural government immediately for severe punishment. This matter concerns the people's livelihood and should not be tolerated.</p>
<h3>The Saving and Rescue Association Advocates: Frugal New Year</h3>
<p>Changzhou Fellow-Countrymen Association to Hold</p>
<p>Radio Broadcast to Solicit Clothes and Rice for Refugees</p>
<p>The Municipal Saving and Rescue Committee received a letter from a member of the Hualian Amusement Association yesterday, implementing a savings of forty yuan in New Year's expenses to help refugees, and requesting promotion and guidance to achieve significant results. The committee has already responded with approval.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Changzhou Fellow-Countrymen Association, in view of the extreme suffering of the refugees, remitted more than a thousand yuan and 1,600 pieces of cotton clothing the day before yesterday for distribution in Changzhou. However, there is a shortage of aid, and it is difficult to provide relief. It is reported that on the 11th and 12th of this month, they will invite famous opera singers Cheng Junmou, the Bao brothers, Jiang Junjia, Xie Wenyuan, Xie Kui, Chen Xiaodie, Gong Zhaoxiong, Yuan Senzhai, Zhao Peixin, Sun Lanting, Sun Junqing, Wang Yiqiu, Mao Jiahua, Xu Qinfang, and over a hundred others to broadcast a special program at the Hua Ying Radio Station to solicit clothes and rice for the refugees. It is especially hoped that philanthropists and fellow-countrymen in Shanghai will donate generously to support this good cause.</p>
<h3>Central Machinery Factory: New Factory Buildings</h3>
<p>Imitating American-Style Yarn Steel Spindles</p>
<p>Already Popular in the National Spinning Industry</p>
<p>It has been many years since China's textile industry adopted European and American machinery and established factories for self-spinning. However, since there were no domestic manufacturers of machinery, it was always purchased from foreign countries, resulting in huge annual foreign exchange losses. Now, Mr. Fan, the founder of the Shanghai Central Machinery Manufacturing Factory in Shanghai, recognized this and has been studying various spindle winding machines and other machine parts for six years. He built a workshop and established a factory in Yu. However, due to the August 13th Incident two years ago, he temporarily moved to 262 Avenue Road in the Public Concession to continue his manufacturing work to meet the needs of major yarn factories in this city and other places. After a detailed investigation by reporters, it was learned that the factory produces high-speed winding machines imitating the American-style (Ning Fan Yiner) and various ball fine yarn steel spindles. Recently, it has also produced large drafts and various thick and thin rollers. Their exquisite craftsmanship and low prices have long been favored by major yarn factories. It is said that the total output for the entire year last year, with spindles alone totaling more than 100,000, was all ordered by factories such as the Shanghai Shenxin No. 9 Factory, Shenxin No. 2 Factory, Dasheng No. 1 Factory, Xinhe, Xinsheng, and the Xi'an Dahua Factory in other places. Recently, the British company Xin Chang Yangxing's Zhongfang Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory has also ordered 20,000 spindles, showing that the factory's products have been recognized by foreign merchants, which is truly commendable. This will not only reduce foreign exchange losses and revive national power, but also add glory to China's machinery manufacturing industry. Now, because the original workshop is insufficient to accommodate the work, the factory has purchased land on West Factory Road and Wuding Road to build new buildings in order to increase work efficiency and further improve product quality. It is reported that the entire project will be completed next month and will be moved in immediately.</p>
<h3>Relief Association Education Group Implements Refugee Education Promotion; Forcing All School-Age Refugee Children to Attend School; Eradicating Illiteracy Among Those Under Forty</h3>
<p>The Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its second Education Committee meeting the day before yesterday, and the following matters were resolved: 1. On the proposal to unify refugee education administration, it was resolved that since refugees' livelihoods are provided by the Association, educational facilities should also be planned by the Association as a whole to achieve uniformity and facilitate progress. Zhao Puchu, Xia Huanxin, and Zhao Chuanjia were elected as members to draft a unified plan for education in all Shanghai shelters, and after review by Cai Renbao, Chen Jicheng, and Yao Siguo, the plan will be submitted to the secretariat for forwarding to the council for approval. 2. On the implementation of the in-service training program for physical education teachers, it was resolved that the principles of the various articles proposed by Wang Fuqie be approved in general. 3. On the review and implementation of the measures for compulsory literacy for adults and school enrollment for children, it was resolved that Zhao Puchu review the compulsory adult literacy case, and the compulsory school enrollment for children be approved in principle. 4. On the proposal to unify the curriculum content for children's education in various shelters, it was resolved to handle it jointly with the proposal to unify refugee youth administration. 5. On how to implement the central supervision district system, it was resolved to implement it according to the previously drafted principles, taking the situation into account. 6. On the review of the education plan for refugee children in the Dunxin Road New Shelter, it was resolved that the principles of the original plan be approved and submitted to the secretariat for forwarding to the Association for approval. 7. On how to stipulate the work of teachers in various shelters, it was resolved to merge it with the first case and formulate and implement it together. 8. On how to train teachers, it was resolved to formulate and implement it together with the first case. The following are excerpts of the important measures:</p>
<p>Compulsory School Enrollment All children in this shelter, both male and female, aged six to sixteen (actual age), must attend the seven-grade children's education class. Children of school age with illnesses or other defects may temporarily postpone school, but they must report to the person in charge and provide a doctor's certificate to be valid. For school-age children who do not report to class, the shelter director and education director must conduct persuasion and order them to attend school. Those who deliberately evade or are truant may be warned. If they still refuse to attend school after three warnings, they may be punished with termination of shelter. School-age children in each shelter who need to leave the shelter for work must report to the shelter's education director and register for reference when grading. Facilitation will be provided to the extent possible, but if it is not possible to facilitate them, they must work after attending classes. The standard number of students in each class is forty. It may be increased or decreased depending on the classroom conditions.</p>
<p>Eradicating Illiteracy All illiterate men and women in each shelter aged sixteen to forty, except for those who are ill or disabled who may postpone learning, must receive four months of literacy education, regardless of whether they are employed or not. The shelter director should compile a list of adults in their shelter who should be educated but have not been, and report it to the group, and form several classes, schedule education times and locations, and attend classes in turn. Once adults in each shelter have been assigned to a class and started classes, they must attend classes on time and must not make excuses for absence, except for special circumstances for which they may ask for leave. If they intentionally skip school, they will be given appropriate punishment once it is verified. Each class should have at least forty students, with at least one class per day, each class lasting sixty minutes. During class time, in addition to literacy, there should also be interspersed lectures on common knowledge such as civic hygiene, history, geography, and nature. The Literacy Textbook will use the "Common People's Thousand-Character Textbook," with one volume completed each month and a test held once. This will be conducted by the shelter directors. At the end of the four-month course, the group will conduct a general test once, and those who pass will be given a literacy certificate.</p>
<p>Literacy Education All administrative and teaching staff in the shelter are members of the Adult Literacy Promotion Group, with the shelter director as the head of the group and the education director as the deputy head of the group. Each member should select ten "little teachers" from the shelter who are over twelve years old and have completed the fifth or sixth grade of elementary school to organize a literacy promotion team. The tasks of the little teachers are as follows: Each teacher must be responsible for guiding two to five illiterate people. Reviewing the literacy lessons already learned by adults. Guiding practice in writing, reading newspapers, and other reading materials. Examining the literacy situation of adults. Assisting the class teacher and urging illiterate people to attend classes. Those little teachers who are excellent in their studies and are trusted by the general illiterate people when teaching may be promoted to assistant teachers and formally teach the illiterate.</p>
<p>In-Service Training Measures for Physical Education Teachers Each shelter must designate one or several people to be responsible for physical education. The physical education staff designated by each shelter must attend the designated location and receive guidance in accordance with the in-service training measures. The training period is tentatively set for four weeks, once a week, with one hour in the outdoor field and one hour indoors.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Brokers' Account Settlement; Deadline for Completion</h3>
<p>If Delay is Used as an Excuse</p>
<p>Business Rights Will Be Revoked</p>
<p>The rice market of the Bean and Rice Industry Association has decided to close the market and stop metering on the 14th of this month, as the general closing is approaching, and to handle the settlement of transactions between industry brokers starting on the 16th. This has been publicly announced in the market. It has been learned that in order to thoroughly rectify and eliminate bad habits in the rice market, it has been decided that the settlement period for broker transactions must be completed before the 16th of this month. If delays are used as excuses and settlement is not cleared, resulting in disputes, they will not be allowed to enter the market for trading when the market opens in the spring, and their business restrictions will be revoked.</p>
<h3>Relief Association - Income and Expenditure Report</h3>
<p>Donations Received in Three Months</p>
<p>Totaling Over 780,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has released its first cash income and expenditure report, stating that the association was officially established on October 18th, the 27th year of the Republic [1938]. Actual work, such as entrusting banks and firms to collect donations, distributing living expenses to refugee camps affiliated with various charitable organizations, and making various payments, began on November 1st. Now, the cash income and expenditure accounts for the three months of November 12th, 27th year of the Republic [1938], and January of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], have been compiled into a report and approved by the board of directors on [blank] day of this month. It is hereby announced to the public. This announcement consists of three tables: the first table is a summary report of cash income and expenditure, the second table is a detailed table of subsidies for living expenses, and the third table is a detailed table of administrative expenses. Finally, the following explanations are added: The total donation income is 786,497.99 yuan. Expenditure on operating expenses: (A) Subsidies for living expenses to various charitable organizations, totaling 254,263.07 yuan; (B) Subsidies for construction costs of the Dunxin Road Refugee Camp, 50,000 yuan; (C) Medical and educational expenses totaling 13,434.37 yuan. Fundraising expenses (including collection and reporting, thank-you advertisements, donation receipts, notices, and expenses for various trade associations and organizations that collect donations on behalf of the association) totaled 12,845.77 yuan. Expenditures were lower in the first month, but exceeded 5,000 yuan in the second and third months, but donation income was also considerable. Administrative expenses totaled 13,013.96 yuan, with an average monthly expenditure of over 4,000 yuan. This covers the salaries of the association's staff and workers. The (Chairman), Vice-Chairman, Director-General, Deputy Director-General, heads of various departments, Treasurer, and Director of the Accounting Department all serve on a voluntary basis, do not receive salaries, and do not receive any allowances. Initial setup costs were the various expenses incurred during the initial preparation and establishment in the first month, with public notices, printing, and donation receipts being the largest items. Starting in the second month, additional printing was done as fundraising expenses (including the purchase of equipment, estimated at 1,000 yuan). Furthermore, 100,000 yuan each was allocated for living expense reserves and post-disaster reserves, which was approved by the board of directors and stored in special accounts. Temporary payments made include 17,085.22 yuan temporarily borrowed by the Nanshi Refugee Area, 10,000 yuan temporarily borrowed by the Cilian Branch, and the remaining 200 yuan for unreimbursed travel expenses. The association's first month's donation income was remitted in the amount of 100,000 yuan. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China provided free currency exchange. The remaining balance from January was also exchanged for 50,000 yuan by the four banks. This report is appended as an acknowledgment of thanks. Furthermore, since the establishment of the association, it has received enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society. The association's members are deeply grateful for the balance remaining up to January of the 28th year of the Republic [1939]. However, with the prolonged period of providing living expenses and post-disaster assistance, and the vast amount of work involved, substantial funds will be required. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will continue to provide a steady stream of support to prevent any shortages. We earnestly pray for this.</p>
<h3>Rare Case of Anthrax Discovered in Isolation Hospital</h3>
<p>Infected by Unsterilized Animal Hair</p>
<p>Jewish Man Dies Despite Treatment</p>
<p>On Tuesday of this week, a Russian Jewish man named Pei Lunji died of anthrax at the Public Concession Isolation Hospital. This disease has not been seen in Shanghai for several years, and has therefore attracted attention from all sides. Anthrax, also known as malignant pustule, is a dreaded skin disease, generally transmitted by unsterilized animal hair. Two days before his death, Pei used a newly purchased shaving brush while shaving. He accidentally cut his skin, and that afternoon, he felt dizzy. Although he went to the hospital for treatment immediately, he could not be saved. Local medical experts believe that the disease originated from the brush he purchased, which was likely made from the hair of a diseased animal and had not been properly sterilized, leading to the infection. Anthrax is originally a disease of animals, especially cattle and sheep, but humans can also be infected through inoculation. Patients develop skin ulcers, and the spleen also enlarges, eventually leading to exhaustion and death. Three years ago, a young Russian artist in Shanghai died from this disease.</p>
<h3>Two Types of Government Bonds to be Redeemed by Lottery Today</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the credibility of government bonds, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the National Debt Fund Management Committee to continue to hold lotteries for the principal and interest of all domestic debts that are due. The seventh redemption of the Unified Class A Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], the third redemption of the first issue of the third Railway Bonds, and the second redemption of the second issue of the bond notes are all scheduled to be held today at 10:00 AM at the Bankers' Association on Hong Kong Road.</p>
<h3>Taishan Opera Troupe Raises Funds Through Radio Broadcast and Performances</h3>
<p>To Relief Shanghai and Guangdong Refugees</p>
<p>Inviting Ms. Li Xuefang to Join</p>
<p>In order to promote the relief movement for refugees in Shanghai and Guangdong, the Taishan Opera Troupe will broadcast famous songs and raise donations at the Xinxin Company radio station. On this day (the 10th) from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM, all the performers will jointly perform. It is reported that famous Cantonese opera stars from Guangdong, including Hua Lisi, Luo Jiaquan, Wen Huamei, Gui Mingyang, and Liang Yintang, have been specially invited to broadcast special programs, which can be described as a gathering of talents, adding to the splendor. Charitable individuals from all walks of life are welcome to enthusiastically request songs.</p>
<p>Also, Cantonese people in Shanghai previously organized the Guangdong Refugee Relief Committee to relieve refugees in Guangdong and have begun fundraising, with satisfactory results. It is reported that the committee, recognizing the suffering of their fellow villagers in Guangdong, has specially invited renowned Cantonese opera artists Ms. Li Xuefang, Gui Mingyang, Luo Jiaquan, and others to join the Taishan Opera Troupe to perform charitable performances to assist in disaster relief. The dates are the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th, a total of four days. The location is the Gengxin Theater. Ticket prices are divided into ten yuan, five yuan, two yuan, and four jiao, with all proceeds being donated to Shanghai refugees, and another portion being donated to Guangdong compatriots. According to Mr. Li Zeyun, the person in charge of the committee and the general manager of Xinxin Company, Ms. Li Xuefang is known as the "Queen of Cantonese Opera," with a reputation similar to that of Mei Lanfang in the north and Li Xuefang in the south, and has retired from the stage for many years. This time, due to the urgent need to relieve refugees, she has resolutely made an exception to perform, which is truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Renters in Ren Zhi and Tong De Lanes Petition Housing Association</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Renters in Ren Zhi Lane on North Sichuan Road and Tong De Lane on East Wuchang Road has previously reported that they have stated their reasons for requesting the landlord, old Sassoon, to postpone rent increases. It is now reported that the association yesterday sent representatives to petition the Housing Problem Committee of the Shanghai Special District, and submitted a petition stating that when the tenants paid the old rent, the landlord’s accounting office solemnly declared that the new rent would only be paid after the area was declared open. Now, the landlord is forcing the tenants to pay the rent, which the tenants find difficult to accept. Repeated negotiations have been fruitless due to the landlord's lack of sincerity. They request the committee to investigate and provide assistance so that the rent can be calculated from the date of opening, in order to achieve fairness. Yang Yifen was appointed as a representative to petition. After the resident member of the committee inquired about the details of the entire situation, they agreed to forward a letter to the landlord, requesting them to understand the difficult times and make concessions.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldier in Sijing Town, Western Shanghai, Hangs Himself Due to War-Weariness Two Japanese Soldiers Demolishing Houses to Build Forts Crushed to Death</h3>
<p>After 80 Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived in Sijing Town, western Shanghai, on the 6th of this month, they stationed themselves in the Hetae Lumber Company and the houses of the Ma family from Henan. They are currently demolishing civilian houses there to build forts, attempting to defend the area for a long time. They are also extorting merchants in the town, demanding a monthly payment of 10,000 yuan as military supplies. As a result, merchants have closed their shops in droves. While the Japanese soldiers were demolishing civilian houses, two soldiers were crushed to death when a house collapsed. In addition, one Japanese soldier hanged himself on the morning of the 7th due to war-weariness.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Report for January</h3>
<p>According to the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in January of this year, 314 small-scale factories and 25 medium-scale factories were opened in the concession (including roads outside the concession). 62 factories were located north of the Suzhou Creek, and 162 factories were located in the West, Central, and North districts. 115 factories were located on roads outside the West district. 178 newly established factories were inspected, employing a total of 6,087 workers. No new large factories applied for building permits during the past month, but several small-scale factories intended to expand. New factories planned to be established outside the concession include one rubber factory and four seasoning powder factories. The factory owners have been given various instructions by the Industrial Section to avoid disturbing neighbors and to ensure the safety of workers.</p>
<p>(Steam Pressure Machinery) Eighteen petitions were received for the registration of boilers and other steam pressure machinery. In addition, 29 boilers are currently being inspected by experts. Fifteen valid inspection certificates were received for the next twelve months. 44 boilers have not been inspected, and the Industrial Section has ordered their owners to promptly apply for inspection procedures. The fourth training class for boiler operators ended on January 10th. On the 23rd of the same month, 44 people in the class received certificates. Boiler operators who have been trained in the past have decided to meet every two weeks to maintain contact with the Industrial Section and maintain a good level of work. The first training class of this year started on January 31st, with 40 trainees.</p>
<p>(Accidents) A total of 124 industrial and occupational accidents were reported to the Industrial Section, including nine fatal accidents. The workers who died were one each from the carpentry, glass, leather tanning, paper, and transportation industries, and two each from the machinery and hardware, and textile industries. Among the injured workers, 27 were in the transportation industry, 25 in the textile industry, and 14 in the machinery industry. Classified by cause, accidents caused by machinery were the most frequent, with a total of 43 cases, including two fatal cases. Accidents caused by electricity accounted for four cases, including one fatal case. Accidents caused by molten metal accounted for two cases, including one fatal case. 23 workers were injured from falls, with two deaths. 14 people were injured by falling objects, with two deaths.

<p>(Factory Fires) A total of 19 fires occurred in factories or related to factory operations (two in the woodworking industry, one in the furniture industry, one in the hardware industry, one in the machinery industry, one in the vehicle manufacturing industry, one in the tile and glass industry, two in the road construction industry, one in the chemical industry, four in the textile industry, one in the clothing industry, two in the food industry, two in the printing and paper industry). In addition, there was one case that did not occur in a factory, but the cause was related to liquids used in the paint industry. There were ten victims. Volatile oils used in various industries are prone to explosion and can easily catch fire, which is very dangerous in crowded workplaces. Some factories use low-quality pumps, which are also prone to accidents. The Industrial Section and the Fire Chief are jointly studying how to control these dangerous substances.</p>
<p>(Labor Disputes) In December of last year, the Industrial Section accepted a labor dispute case at the Commercial Press. The employees of the press made four demands, one of which was to restore pre-war salaries. After investigating the facts, the Industrial Section calculated the real wages of the employees and explained it to the press, hoping that the press could find a way to adjust the wages. The Shanghai manager of the press sent the figures provided by the Industrial Section to Hong Kong for review by the general manager. The general manager replied, stating that the company's business has been declining in the past three years, and this year will be even worse. The current wages paid by the press are 72% of what was paid before, but this year's business is only 43% of the pre-war business in 1936. The company has not laid off employees, so it has to reduce wages across the board. After this letter was forwarded to the employees, three employees have left for Hong Kong. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Gunmen on Avenue Road Repeatedly Involved in Murder Cases Proved to be Involved in the Killing of Geng Shoubao After Examination of Shell Casings</h3>
<p>Situation in Western Shanghai May Take a Turn for the Worse</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," yesterday (the 8th) afternoon, thugs fired repeatedly on Avenue Road, leaving behind seventeen shell casings. After examination by ballistics experts from the Public Concession Police, it was discovered that the guns used by the thugs had been used in many previous cases. One of them had been used in no less than thirteen cases, and two others had been used in five and four cases, respectively. The murderers who shot and killed Geng Shoubao, the leader of the pseudo-detective team, in a gambling den on Connaught Road on Wednesday morning, used these three guns. One of them was used by thugs to shoot a Western police officer from the Jing'an Temple Police Station last December while the officer was riding a motorcycle on Brennan Road. Another one was used by thugs to fire warning shots on Brennan Road and rob two Chinese police officers of two automatic pistols. Of the four criminals who escaped from the prison in Fahua Town that was run by Japanese forces after they were arrested by the Public Concession Police, two had been identified by Chinese police officers as the thugs who robbed the pistols on Brennan Road. It is widely believed that the ten or eleven thugs who opened fire on Avenue Road yesterday included the four escaped criminals. Moreover, the shell casings proved that they were not only related to the above-mentioned cases, but also to many other cases since August of last year. Now these thugs are becoming increasingly bold, and crimes such as gambling are rampant on the roads outside the concession. Therefore, based on the current situation, the situation may take a turn for the worse. However, it is rumored that the Japanese will instruct the puppet regime to take stronger direct measures to curb gambling dens and close all 23 of them within three or four days. According to unconfirmed reports, after the gambling dens are closed, only six of them will be allowed to reopen, with the type of gambling to be determined by the Japanese and strictly managed.</p>

<h3>Quarrel Over Debt Leads to Murder</h3>
<p>Murderer Appeals Against the Sentence</p>
<p>The Victim's Family Files a Lawsuit for Damages</p>
<p>Gong Yinchu, a 29-year-old bargeman from Chongming, guaranteed a gambling debt of 40 yuan owed by his partner Chen Yalang to Gu Xiuhua, who was also in the same business. Because the debt was overdue, Gu Xiuhua and Sun Miaolin (30 years old, from Chongming) went to Room 40 of the Chunjiang Second Inn on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession at 4:00 PM on November 30 of last year to demand payment from Chen. However, Chen was out on business, and only the guarantor Gong Yinchu was in the room. Gu and Sun started arguing with Gong about the debt, which led to a quarrel. The quarrel escalated from inside the room to the stairway outside the room, resulting in a physical fight. Gong pushed Sun Miaolin, who fell down the stairs, causing internal injuries. Sun was sent to the hospital for treatment, but died at 7:00 PM that afternoon. The victim's family reported the incident to the French Police Station, and Gong was arrested. Sun's body was sent to the mortuary for examination. The autopsy confirmed that Sun died from injuries sustained in the fall. The police sent Gong to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to the law. After the trial was concluded, Gong was sentenced to imprisonment. He is now appealing to the Third Branch Court. The defendant is being held in the detention center. The deceased's adopted father, Sun Wangzhi, has hired lawyer Shi Qinghua to file a lawsuit with the civil court of the Second Special Court against Gong Yinchu for damages. The court, according to the complaint, held a hearing in Civil Court 7 yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Ma Yishu. The defendant was brought from the detention center, and the plaintiff and his lawyer were present in court. They stated the details of the case and sought damages of 3,000 yuan.

The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation and questioning.</p>
<h3>Shooting in the Billiard Room of the Dadong Hotel Japanese Men Quarrel While Playing Billiards and Brandish Guns Fortunately, No One Was Injured</h3>
<p>A gunshot was heard in the billiard room on the ground floor of the Dadong Hotel on Yinghua Street at about 2:40 PM yesterday. At the time, there were conflicting reports, and there were rumors that someone was injured. However, these were completely untrue. At the time, one of the billiard tables in the middle of the Dadong billiard room was occupied by four or five middle-aged men who resembled Japanese. They were constantly bickering with each other. One of the men, however, was too unskilled, losing repeatedly, and became angry out of shame. He suddenly quarreled with his companions, who retorted. This caused the man to fly into a rage, and he took out a pistol from his pocket, intending to intimidate the others. However, he accidentally touched the trigger, and a bullet was discharged. Fortunately, the muzzle was pointed downwards and did not injure anyone nearby. However, the gunshot startled many bystanders, and it was learned that the man who drew the gun had been grazed by the bullet. He was persuaded by his companions and left. By the time the police arrived after hearing the news to investigate, they were all gone. No one reported the incident to the police station afterwards, and no one with gunshot wounds sought treatment at the hospital. However, the police authorities are still investigating the matter to ascertain the facts.</p>

<h3>The Great Power of Religion Convinces Thief to Confess Gu Xueren, Who Robbed a Woman's Wallet, Realized His Wrongdoings After Hearing a Pastor's Sermon</h3>
<p>On the night of the 4th of this month at 10:20 PM, Gao Guiying and two female companions were at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road when a thug suddenly came forward and robbed Gao of her wallet, worth eight yuan, and fled into Lane 1462 nearby. At the time, Gao and her companions chased after him themselves. Soon after, a man came out of the lane and was identified as the robber. The police were called, and the man was taken to the police station. After investigation, it was found that he was not involved and was released. However, at 7:50 PM the night before last, Gu Xueren (32 years old), a man from Pudong, voluntarily surrendered to the Chengdu Road Police Station, saying that he had robbed a woman of her wallet on Avenue Edward VII on February 4 and had already pawned it. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted him according to Article 325 of the Criminal Law and stated that the defendant had voluntarily surrendered to the police station. Because the stolen goods have not been recovered and the plaintiff has not been found, he requested a postponement. When questioned, Gu Xueren confessed to the robbery. When the judge asked him why he had voluntarily surrendered to the police station, Gu said that yesterday he was passing by the church on Jing'an Temple Road when he happened to hear Mr. Shen preaching, saying that if a person has done something wrong, he should quickly confess in order to avoid disaster and receive blessings. Upon hearing these words, he realized his wrongdoings and surrendered to the police station. The judge ordered that Gu be detained and postponed the hearing to the 14th.</p>
<h3>Youth Exhausted and Destitute, Forging Documents to Defraud, Attempting to Defraud the Palm Company of Five Hundred Dollars, Two Arrested and Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Palm Company, located at 51 Guangdong Road, Room 311, specializing in Palm soap and other cosmetics, with Ma Bole as the manager, also has a distribution office in Hong Kong, with Cantonese Lin Peng as the agent. Due to business relations, Lin often comes to Shanghai to meet with Ma to discuss business. On the morning of the 8th, Ma</p>
<p>Suddenly Received a Phone Call, according to the person on the other end, he was entrusted by Lin Peng to notify that Lin had already arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. Due to urgent needs, he planned to temporarily borrow 500 legal tender. Ma then asked Lin to answer the phone himself, but the person on the other end said that Lin was currently out, but had already prepared a letter, and would send someone to collect the money. The conversation ended there. At 4 pm, a youth came with a letter from Lin to see Ma Bole. According to the youth, he was</p>
<p>Lin Ming's Nephew. Ma looked at the letterhead, which was from the East Asia Hotel. He asked when Lin Peng had arrived in Shanghai. The youth replied that he arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 6th on the Taiyuan ship. However, just recently, Ma had received a handwritten letter from Lin from Hong Kong via the Taiyuan ship, which clearly showed that Lin had not left Hong Kong to come to Shanghai. Moreover, the Taiyuan ship only arrived in Shanghai at 7 am on the 7th, so how could Lin have arrived in Shanghai on the 6th? Therefore, he called</p>
<p>The East Asia Hotel (because Lin always stays at that hotel when he comes to Shanghai) to inquire. He was told that Lin had not checked into the hotel. Ma then realized that the person was definitely a swindler. He immediately reported to the General Patrol Room. Chinese Detective Cheng Renkun rushed to the scene and arrested the youth. Upon questioning, his name was Lu Xuchu, a Cantonese, 21 years old. Just as he was about to be taken back to the patrol room, a Cantonese named Lin Minji stepped forward to obstruct him. He was also taken back to the patrol room. Under investigation, according to Lin, he was indeed Lin Peng's nephew. Now, because he was</p>
<p>Extremely Bored and Destitute, he conspired with Lu to defraud 500 dollars. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court, Criminal Division One. The patrol room lawyer Ru Baozang prosecuted them for forgery and fraud under Articles 210, 217, and 339 of the Criminal Law. After questioning the facts by Judge Feng Shide, he sentenced Lu and Lin to four months of imprisonment each as a warning.</p>

There are only four people in his family: his mother-in-law, who is over fifty years old, his wife Xing, and his children. At 12:30 am the night before (the 7th), five or six bandits suddenly came, entered from the empty house next door, crossed the wall, and broke into the room. At that time, Xing and others were already asleep. The bandits forced them to put on their clothes, showed their pistols, and forbade them to make any noise. They ordered them to hand over their gold jewelry and cash. When they refused, the bandits beat Xing with gun handles and firewood. Seeing this, her mother knelt down and begged, and gave the bandits a small gold coil worth more than ten dollars and seven dollars and fifty cents in cash from her pillow before they stopped beating her. Then they proceeded to search and plunder, taking all the cotton-padded men's and women's clothing, more than twenty pieces, five broken cotton waddings, three silver rings, a gold-plated ring, two cotton mattresses, etc. In addition, they put two baskets of rice cakes just brought from Ningbo and more than six dou of white rice into hemp sacks, and carried the stolen goods away.</p>
<h3>Opium Spreads Rampantly in Western Shanghai, Setting up a Public Sales Bureau, Jiang Yumen and Others, Disregarding the Law, Raise Millions to Promote the Spread of Narcotics</h3>
<p>After the realization of the opium public sales in Western Shanghai, the atmosphere of narcotics enveloped the area, causing great harm. It is now learned that local merchants Jiang Yumen and narcotics traders Zheng, Liu, etc., all from Chaoyang, have raised one million yuan to set up a public sales bureau in the triangle field in Western Shanghai, monopolizing all narcotics sales matters. They deposited the one million yuan capital into the Japanese Zhengjin Bank as a deposit and guarantee, and agreed with the Japanese side that the Japanese side would issue at least two to five boxes of local goods every day, and the payment for the goods would be deducted from the deposit. Therefore, they made countless profits. Liu and others all hold important positions as managers of the public sales bureau. Jiang was wanted by the Songhu Garrison Command in 1934 for trafficking in red pills, but escaped the net. Now he is rampant and lawless, truly disregarding death.</p>

<h3>The Bureau of Public Works Clears the Sidewalks</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession's Bureau of Public Works cleared the sidewalks last winter, ordering the stall vendors on Avenue Edward VII to move, a part of the stall vendors set up stalls and operated on various roads in the Public Concession. The Public Concession police authorities, believing that this not only hindered traffic but also affected the appearance of the city, and because it was the end of the business year, in order to maintain traffic, they have been ordering street vendors who do not have business licenses to stop or move their operations for several days. The remaining beggars and vagrants have all been arrested and sent to the suburbs.</p>

<h3>The Prevalence of Smallpox is Gradually Declining</h3>
<p>The Number of Weekly Cases Reduced to Dozens</p>

However, recently, the number of people per week has been only dozens. Therefore, although it is still prevalent, the degree of prevalence has decreased compared to before. This is probably due to the fact that the weather has become cold, and the infectious bacteria are not as active as before.</p>

<h3>British Oxford University Purchases Books for Donation to Chinese Schools, Mr. and Mrs. Shi Boding Have Donated £2,000</h3>
<p>Since the all-out war of resistance, China's academic and cultural undertakings have suffered greatly. Academic and cultural organizations and groups across the country feel that cultural work cannot be interrupted for a day and that losses should be urgently supplemented. They have initiated the organization of a Wartime Book Collection Committee. Since its establishment, it has been actively carrying out the collection of books from abroad. Recently, the committee received a letter from Oxford University in the UK, stating that Mr. Shi Boding of the school suggested to the university authorities to launch a donation of urgently needed books and instruments to Chinese universities. Mr. and Mrs. Shi are willing to donate £2,000 first to purchase books in the UK and send them to the Southwest Associated University in Kunming. They are also willing to continue to donate £3,000. If other personnel at Oxford University can also raise the same or a larger amount of cash or goods, Oxford University stated that it is willing to engage in the collection and supply of detailed methods for books, instruments, cash, and foreign teachers. This assistance is completely based on cultural sympathy and has no political, economic, or religious effect. In the future, each book donated will be accompanied by a photo of Oxford and an English inscription "In the friendship of study and research, Oxford University respectfully presents to Chinese universities," and the Chinese inscription "All within the four seas are brothers." It is reported that after receiving this letter, the Wartime Book Collection Committee, in addition to immediately replying to express its gratitude, has first asked the four regions of Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Nanzheng to list the books they most need, so as to forward them to Oxford University. Regarding the relief of university students, the International Student Service has already raised funds to send to China. The book and instrument donation campaign, initiated by Mr. Fisher, the president of the New College of Oxford University, and Mr. Shi Boding, is the first step. Countries can follow up and respond.</p>

<h3>Sports Field Equipment Becomes a Problem: Schools Discuss Cooperative Borrowing</h3>
<p>Those with sports fields should open them for borrowing with reasonable fees, but not too high.</p>
<p>Since August 13th in this city, the population has surged, and the number of young people seeking education has also increased. As a result, the number of schools is even more developed than before the war. However, due to the scarcity of buildings, the equipment in most schools is simple and crude. Moreover, many schools have been affected by the war and have relocated to Shanghai from the war zone, suffering losses that are difficult to recover. Therefore, it is particularly difficult to replenish equipment. School principals once gathered to exchange opinions and seek ways of mutual assistance and cooperation. In addition to scientific experiments, there are already two institutions established, the Natural Science Experiment Institute and the Science Experiment Institute, which can be used by students from various schools. Many libraries can also be opened for public reading, so there is no problem. However, the equipment for sports fields is the most difficult to obtain, especially for sports schools. Therefore, after exchanging opinions, the school principals plan to request schools with sports field equipment to open them for borrowing to other schools, so that schools without sports field equipment in the vicinity can arrange time to practice sports and pay reasonable fees, but not too high.</p>

<p>National Medicine and Diet</p>
<h3>Daily Foods for Patients with Scrofula</h3>
<p>— Song Zhaorong</p>
<p>The following items are proven to be effective for patients with scrofula, which is in line with medical principles. They can be eaten as daily food, which is beneficial and harmless, so you might as well give them a try.</p>
<p>Taro: It is an extremely nutritious product. After steaming or boiling, eat two or three before each meal, long-term use is sure to have a miraculous effect. According to research, this thing contains a large amount of calcium, which is of great help in the treatment of scrofula.</p>
<p>Prunella vulgaris tea: Prunella vulgaris has the effect of dispelling nodules, resolving toxins, resolving phlegm, removing blood stasis, relieving heat, and clearing dampness. It is often used in medicine and is peaceful and effective. If you use it to decoct soup instead of tea in summer, it has a fragrant smell and is not very bitter. It can both refresh the stomach and relieve heat, and can also cure scrofula. It can be said to kill two birds with one stone. Even if it is not summer, it is also possible.</p>
<p>Water chestnut: It can eliminate food and resolve phlegm. It is also very beneficial for patients with scrofula to eat it. However, this thing grows in paddy fields and is cold in nature. Children with weak spleen and stomach are prone to umbilical pain if they eat too much, so they should not be allowed to eat it at will. This is also something that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Seaweed, kelp, jellyfish, etc.: All of the above products are salty in taste. Because they are algae, they are rich in iodine and are very effective in treating scrofula.</p>
<h3>Longan Paste</h3>
<p>— He Lisan</p>
<p>Longan, also known as dragon eye. It tastes sweet and is slightly warm in nature. It functions to nourish blood and nourish yin, and benefit the heart and kidneys. Some people take it raw, while others take it by decoction. However, it is better to take it by decoction: The method of making soup is to first peel off a certain amount of longan pulp, add codonopsis and astragalus, (or you can add ginseng whiskers, and if yin is deficient and body fluids are insufficient, add two or three cents of American ginseng.) Place in a covered bowl, seal with paper, pierce holes, and put it in a rice pot for about ten steaming sessions. When serving, take a certain amount, add boiling water to decoct, boil thoroughly and serve. Its taste is sweet but not greasy. Longan itself is rich in nutrition, and with the help of codonopsis and astragalus, it complements each other and can greatly replenish qi and blood and strengthen the spleen and stomach. It is suitable for men and women with weak constitutions.</p>

<p>Eight or nine out of ten women suffer from leucorrhea. Now I have a prescription that is easy to treat and very effective. You can buy lotus seeds and gorgon fruit from various southern goods stores, no matter how much, steam and cook them very thoroughly, and add a little rock sugar when eating. Lotus seeds and gorgon fruit are both sweet and neutral in nature. Lotus seeds can clear the phase fire and consolidate the kidney. Gorgon fruit can tonify the spleen, treat leucorrhea, and benefit the kidneys and treat leakage. When used together, they cultivate the spleen and kidneys, clear the phase fire, and astringe the essence gate. They are truly wonderful products for treating leucorrhea. However, you must take it often to be effective.</p>
<h3>Eel and Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zanchen</p>
<p>The method of treating consumption is nothing more than enhancing the defensive function of its tissues to achieve the purpose of healing. But to achieve this goal, you must first make sure that you are adequately nourished. Those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis can cook eel every week, dip it in soy sauce and serve it as a side dish, which is most suitable. Eel is rich in fatty nutrients, so it can treat pulmonary tuberculosis, sores, fistulas, and scrofula. Regular consumption is very beneficial. People only know that cod liver oil is a nourishing product for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, but they do not know that eel is actually better than cod liver oil. However, eel meat is fatty, thick and sticky, so you should first assess the digestive power of its intestines and stomach as a measure, and advance the amount according to circumstances. It is better to eat less and eat frequently, do not eat too much at once, so as not to harm the food. Otherwise, if this sticky product is temporarily input into the stomach and intestines, it will not only fail to digest it completely, but will also damage its function and cause symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, which must be paid attention to.</p>
<h3>Changes in the Condition of Typhoid Fever and the Dietary Program (6)</h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>The previous article talked about the drinks and food for typhoid fever when the chills and fever have not subsided. After the chills and fever have subsided, the inflammation in the intestines has subsided, and the digestive function can gradually function. At this time, food is needed to supply consumption, which is obviously different from the situation when the chills and fever have not subsided.</p>
<p>A. The first to fourth day after the initial retreat of cold and heat. The food is about five kinds: rice porridge, lotus root powder, oatmeal soup, rice noodles, and Cantonese people can eat osmanthus powder soup.</p>
<p>There are about eight kinds of drinks: barley tea, Job's tears tea, mulberry sprout tea, black tea, green tea, milk, soy milk, tofu flower, reed root tea, and those who have been sick for a long time and whose tongues are red and consume Yin fluid can drink American ginseng and dendrobium tea.</p>
<p>There are about six kinds of side dishes: sweet pickles (spit out the residue), Yunnan mustard tuber (spit out the residue), cream, jellyfish, sesame paste, and tofu mixed with green salt.</p>
<p>There are about five kinds of fruits: oranges, Xinhui oranges, water chestnuts, olives, and pears. There are very few side dishes that can be selected within four days after the initial retreat of cold and heat. When the cold and heat have just subsided, the body needs food to replenish consumption, and after a long period of starvation, it makes people eat exceptionally. After lying down for a long time, once the disease is initially released, the only consumption and comfort is diet. Therefore, it is as if the thirsty are seeking food, and the appetite is extremely strong! At this time, there is a crisis, that is, because after the typhoid fever has recovered, the stomach and intestines have not returned to normal, and the old wounds in the intestines have just healed, they cannot withstand stagnation. There are three reasons for the recurrence of typhoid fever: sickness from overeating, sickness from labor, and sickness from being exposed to cold. Among them, most cases are caused by eating too much. Because the stomach needs food very strongly after the disease, the digestive capacity of the intestines, where the old wounds have just healed, is very difficult. The stomach is strong and the intestines are weak, which is why it is most prone to recurrence. Therefore, you should still abstain from food during the illness. There are many of the above-mentioned beverages, and you can take one each day and rotate them to change the taste. You should not try several kinds in one day.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned items have been almost completely covered in the four days after the retreat of cold and heat from typhoid fever. It is not advisable to try other items. Greasy, meaty, raw, cold and wild game are all taboo.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Six Kinds of Nourishing Foods (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Hu Xianglin</p>
<p>Walnut Wine: Method: Mash purple-clothed walnuts with their skins on, add good aged wine, put them in a pot and cook thoroughly, and add a little sugar.</p>
<p>Regular consumption can nourish the brain and produce essence, make the skin smooth and shiny, make the beard and hair black and lustrous, and make the blood vessels smooth. Walnuts contain a large amount of fat, which can make bowel movements smooth. Its skin contains tannic acid, which can treat nocturnal emission and panting. Every morning, take two or three fried salted walnuts with their skins on and drink it with milk or cocoa, which also has nourishing effects.</p>
<p>Yam Powder: Method: Soak one liter of glutinous rice in water overnight, drain and stir-fry over low heat until very hot, grind and sieve it like flying flour. Slightly stir-fry fresh Huai yam, grind it into powder and add it to the rice flour. Every morning, take half a cup and add one teaspoon of sugar or a little walnut powder, and serve it with boiling water. It can treat diarrhea, nocturnal emission, and reduce food intake. Yam can relieve irritation in the intestines and increase absorption in the intestinal walls. It can also ingest the essence gate.</p>
<h3>Children's Dessert "Spleen-Strengthening Powder"</h3>
<p>— Yu Xiangyun</p>
<p>Most children are gluttonous and like to eat snacks in addition to regular meals, but many snacks are unhygienic and difficult to digest, so children often suffer from food poisoning and gastrointestinal diseases, so you have to pay attention to children's snacks. When a child's face is yellow, gluttonous, thin, and about to develop malnutrition, there is a "spleen-strengthening powder" that has many effects such as strengthening the spleen, eliminating food, and killing insects when given to children. Use two ounces of Huai yam, ten chicken gizzards, two ounces of sesame seeds, two ounces of lentils, four cents of charred hawthorn charcoal, one ounce of Jianlian meat, one ounce of Poria, five cents of Quisqualis indica, and three liters of white rice. First, stir-fry the rice, sesame seeds, etc. separately, then grind them into powder, and mix them evenly to make it successful. When eating, add white sugar, or eat it dry or with boiled water, it tastes sweet and fragrant, it is really a food that is most suitable for children's intestines and stomach.</p>
<h3>Low-Cost Nutritional Food</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zuosan</p>
<p>Turtle: Turtle is a very common aquatic animal that can be eaten in all seasons. Because it has the essence of hiding to Yin, it is especially suitable for eating in winter. Turtle shells are often used in medicines to nourish Yin and reduce fever. As for turtle meat, its nature is sweet and neutral. The Separate Records states: "It mainly treats injuries, benefits qi, and supplements insufficiency." It is also listed as a tonic in the New Materia Medica, and is truly a wonderful product for nourishing Yin (blood, body fluids, endocrine) and also treats beriberi.</p>
<p>Pig Blood: Remember that President Sun Yat-sen's theory in the example of knowing is difficult and doing is easy once mentioned using pig blood to replenish blood. Pig blood is the cheapest thing, and its blood-replenishing power is well known to everyone. According to the Materia Medica, it can produce blood and also treat stroke, headache, and dizziness. Because pig blood contains iron and other substances, after digestion and absorption, it produces the effect of increasing blood. As for stroke, headache, dizziness, etc., they are all caused by blood deficiency, high blood pressure, or anemia leading to neurasthenia. Regular consumption of pig blood often heals, so "replenishing blood with blood" seems to be a very foreseeing theory, but the fact is that it is extremely effective.

<h3>Recent Popular Evil Disease: Smallpox and the Problem of Hunger and Satiety</h3>
<p>— You Xuezhou</p>
<p>Diet is for nourishing life, and also for causing death. Those who are sick should pay especially close attention to their diet. If it is appropriate, it can assist the inadequacy of medicine, and through reasonable nourishment, increase the power to resist disease. If it is not appropriate, it will only increase the burden on the digestion of the stomach and intestines, and the disease will take the opportunity to expand its power.</p>
<p>"Hungry measles, full pox" is a common saying. Roughly translated, it means that for measles, diet should be moderate, and being slightly hungry is best; for smallpox, the opposite is true, food should be plentiful, and there is no need to deliberately suppress it or reduce the amount eaten. Ordinary people, with an example to follow and a saying to rely on, no longer restrict the diet of those suffering from smallpox—some, feeling hungry, are frequently given food; others, with weak stomachs and no appetite, are forced to eat more. The final result is that the stomach and intestines become stagnant, or diarrhea occurs, causing a significant change.</p>
<p>The saying "full pox" cannot be absolutely denied; however, one should act according to the situation. It does not mean that all types of pox should have their appetite satisfied, making them full at every meal. The elimination of disease relies on the control of medicine on the one hand, and on the body's own ability to resist in the long term on the other. This resistance comes from the nourishment provided by diet. If those with a disease can eat, the production of resistance can be endless. Since smallpox is a dangerous disease that lasts a long time, if there is no food to nourish it, there will be no ability to resist in the long term. Therefore, being able to eat is a good thing. The meaning of "full pox" should be viewed from the opposite perspective—not seeking to be full, but not allowing hunger. However, this only refers to those whose digestive system is not obstructed by the smallpox. If food tastes bad, or there is no appetite, what good is it to force food down? The most important point of dietary nourishment is to stop when appropriate, not allowing hunger, nor overeating, and even more so, not forcing extra meals.</p>
<p>Smallpox is a pestilence. It is better to clear it than to supplement it. Therefore, one should not be prejudiced about diet, lest complications arise and lead to an irreversible situation. According to my experience, if those suffering from smallpox, whether infants or adults, show slight dysentery at the beginning—but excessive diarrhea is to be avoided—the course will be smooth. This is the body's own method of self-rescue, allowing the heat toxin to be discharged, reducing the epidemic's power, and easing the symptoms. It is also a wonderful physiological function. In this regard, being able to eat with smallpox is a good thing. If one does not want to eat, or eats little, one should not force them to eat, or eat without limit, adding a burden to digestion, giving the pestilence reinforcements and making the flames even stronger, turning originally peaceful symptoms into a dangerous situation. Life and death can be reversed in an instant. Those in the family who are responsible for caring for the sick should be careful not to be constrained by common sayings!</p>

<h3>Securities: Interest Payments Have an Immediate Impact, Foreign Debt Market Prices Continue to Rise, British and German Bonds Reach £72, British and French Bonds Continue to Rise by £2, Many Domestic Bonds are Traded Speculatively</h3>
<p>London's listing prices for Chinese foreign debt on the 8th of this month (Wednesday) were affected by the announcement of the timely payment of principal and interest on the continued British-German loans. Confidence immediately turned positive, and most bonds rose by half a pound or a pound. British and French loan bonds rose by £2 to a price of £52. Of the remaining four types, all rose by half a pound except for the Sino-French US dollar bonds, which remained unchanged. British-German continued loan bonds continued to rise to £71, British gold consolidation bonds rose to £48.5, Crisp bonds rose to £34, and Fick Aircraft bonds rose to £14. Railway bonds on the lower end, the Huguang Railway bonds should have printed bond certificates rebounded by half a pound, priced at £20. The Beijing-Shanghai and Guangzhou-Kowloon railway bonds each rose by one pound, the former priced at £23 and the latter at £19.5. The rest remained unchanged. The London physical supply included £2,000 of British and French loan bonds, sold at £52.5, half a pound above the market price. £3,000 of Crisp bonds drawn between 1936 and 1938 were also sold at £52.5, £18.5 above the market price (these drawn bonds, if they are restored to principal payment in the future, will be given priority and the interest rate is half a percent higher than British and French loans, so the asking price is the same as British and French). Previously, there were £2,000 each of the original German-issued and subsequent German-issued Jinpu Railway bonds, sold at £17 each, one pound above the market price, and 15 shillings higher than yesterday's market. There was also £1,000 of German-issued printed Huguang Railway bonds, sold at £20, on par with the market.</p>

The Kailuan Mining Administration stock rebounded by six pence, priced at 17 shillings and six pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The unofficial securities market saw fluctuating conditions yesterday. There were increases and decreases in the morning and afternoon, and trading gradually calmed. There were slightly more transactions, causing fluctuations. Retail investors were nothing more than temporary speculators, going in and out, shifting with the market. Because the end of the year is approaching, all parties are waiting to see what happens next year, making it the end of the year. Today, Type A will hold its seventh lottery. The market price should be calculated ex-dividend.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market: In the morning, Xin Fenglian's short covering initially appeared strong, but turned weak after Nos. 5 and Yonghe sold. The range of fluctuations was about three to four corners. In the afternoon, the situation was the opposite of the morning. It was initially weak due to selling by Nos. 10 and Yongkang, but slightly stronger due to buying by Tongkang and No. 64. Although the price of Type A, which was drawn consecutively, was the last day, it did not rise and fall like other types due to the selling of Yongkang, so the result was a small three corners. Types Ding and 96 did not trade, and the rest were slightly better by three or four corners. The total transaction volume was estimated at over 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: Yesterday, 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 5 yuan and 7 jiao. The rest were ignored, it is said.</p>
<h3>Finance: Loan News Resurfaces, Cash Prices Suddenly Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday's conditions in the unofficial market for cash sycee continued to be flat and weak. The price declined because cash shops, silver shops, and northern merchants came to sell. Only Zhongsong caused some silver firms and Hong Kong merchants to purchase due to rumors of tight and weak foreign exchange, so the market price once turned strong. In the end, Reuters suddenly reported that the UK would continue to lend China HK$60 million. This caused confidence to turn downward again, pushing the price to the 2,040 yuan mark. Trading was slightly stronger than the previous day. There was no change in silver jewelry. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>Sycee Unofficial Market Falls by One Yuan</p>
<p>Since this morning, a certain silver shop initially called for 2,042 yuan per bar (10 taels) to buy. At that time, a certain gold shop also intended to buy. However, sellers were only willing to supply at 46 yuan. Therefore, the two sides held out until about 10 o'clock before trading began. First, a certain silver shop bought 50 taels each from cash shops and peers, both at 2,044 yuan as the opening price. Subsequently, gold shops and silver shops traded 50 taels with each other, both at the same price as before. After this, the price gradually declined due to slightly more sellers. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange business at 43 yuan. After the money exchange business absorbed it, it bought 50 taels from northern merchants at the original price. Later, the gold shop sold another 50 taels to the money exchange business at 41 yuan. In addition, a certain silver shop also sold 50 taels to a certain silver firm, at the same price. After this, foreign exchange softened slightly due to foreign firms scooping up, so the selling wind stopped immediately. A certain gold shop also turned from selling to buying, and a certain silver firm continued to absorb, so the price went upward. A certain silver firm bought 50 taels from the silver shops, and the price jumped to 45 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop bought 50 taels from the silver shops at 46 yuan. Later, the silver shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange business again at the same price. The silver shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange business again at 45 yuan. The time was already 11:15. After this, there was no trading, and the price remained fixed. Therefore, the midday closing price was still 45 yuan. In the afternoon, at about 2 o'clock, a certain money exchange business first bought 50 taels from the gold shop at 45 yuan. After this, the buying intention of the money exchange business was still strong, but sellers were scarce. Later, it bought 50 taels from the silver shops at 47 yuan as the highest peak. At 3:45, the silver shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange business again at 45 yuan. At that time, Reuters suddenly reported that the UK would continue to lend China HK$60 million, so confidence leaned downward. Most floating long positions wanted to sell, but buyers were mostly watching. Although the price was called down to 40 yuan, it was still difficult to find a match, so the late closing price was still 2,045 yuan, which was one yuan lower than the previous day. The range of the whole day was 6 yuan. The selling price of cash shop's own brand gold was 2,050 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,035 yuan. The current premium gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Still at Original Price</p>
<p>The selling price of silver jewelry per tael has not changed. Datong Heng and Lao Qingyun still hang at the original price of 207 yuan, and Xin Tonghang hangs at the original price of 205 yuan, with a purchase price of 199 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>An 8th London dispatch states that British pure gold per ounce has not changed, still at £7 8s 4d, so the central bank's Chinese cash purchase price also remains at 1,210 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs duty still shows no change, remaining at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remains fixed, still calculated at 1,206 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Korean Bills Have Started Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both British pure gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. The demand for foreign exchange was still strong. The supply intentions of Hong Kong telegrams and banks were slightly smoother, and the trend was slightly weaker. The supply of sycee was not smooth. Real users’ absorption turned weak. Fearing the government's maintenance of foreign exchange, they did not dare to boldly drag in, so the market price remained stable, and trading was slightly inferior. The price of foreign currency rose slightly due to the slight weakness of the exchange rate. US dollar bills, Hong Kong bills, and foreign banks had more demand. Korean bill transactions have also started. The guild's transactions are still prosperous. Qintai sold and Hongtai bought HK$500 of Hong Kong bills. Litong sold and Chenghai bought US$1,000 of US dollar bills. Qintai sold and Chenghai bought US$500 of US dollar bills. Zhenxing sold and Chenghai bought US$300 of US dollar bills. Sentai sold and Hongchang bought HK$1,000 of Hong Kong Cai. Taihe and Chenghai sold and Chenghai bought £110 of British gold bills. Yesterday's market price: British gold pound fell by 5 fen, British gold bill rose by 1 jiao and 5 fen, US dollar bill rose by 3 fen and 3 li, Hong Kong bill rose by 7 li, French franc bill rose by 1 li, Canadian bill rose by half a li, Philippine bill rose by 2 fen, and other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Discount Rates Show Little Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange transfers remained fixed. Each 1,000 yuan fluctuated around 35 yuan all day. The final price was 35 yuan, which was the same as the previous day's price.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Diverge</h3>
<p>An 8th London dispatch stated that the market was stable, with few changes. After closing, it was flat and slightly stagnant. Large bar silver did not change in the near term, and the far term shrank by 0.0625. A New York silver dispatch stated that the American difficult price remained fixed. A Mumbai silver dispatch stated that the Indian silver market was calm, spot goods did not move, and both near and far terms increased by two annas.</p>
<h3>Numerous Wheat Settlement Transactions, Foreign Exchange Turns Tight Again, Later Heard UK Will Continue to Loan to China, Market Condition Immediately Turns From Tight to Stable</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw numerous wheat settlement transactions and other foreign firms' settlements were also quite large. In addition, foreign banks had limited funds, so the underlying trend was tight. Later, Reuters suddenly reported that the UK would continue to lend China HK$60 million, and Hong Kong telegrams came to sell heavily, so the situation stopped being tight and turned flat. There were slight twists and turns in the middle, but no excessive fluctuations. Trading was quite active. Hong Kong exchange was initially quite strong with foreign banks absorbing, and the underlying trend was also tight. Later, money exchange businesses heard news that the UK would continue to loan China, so they frequently sold, causing the underlying trend to return to flat immediately.</p>
<p>In the morning, the London large bar was nearly flat and the far term shrunk. New York banks did not move, and London raw gold also did not rise or fall. The exchange rate shrank 1 li from pound to dollar, fell 4 centimes from pound to franc, and was 0.0625 from pound to Shanghai. The dollar to pound did not change, the dollar to franc was small 0.0625, and the dollar to Shanghai was large 5 fen. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained fixed as before. The bank's early selling price was 8 pence 2.03125 for the British exchange rate and 16 yuan for the US exchange rate, which was flat for the British exchange rate and tight 0.03125 for the US exchange rate compared to the previous day's midday closing. Although a certain foreign firm was scooping up, the foreign banks' supply intentions were also good at that time, so the situation was still stable. A certain foreign firm settled and bought Jardine Matheson and American Bank's Dutch American exchange rate at 16 yuan. HSBC's listed exchange rate announcement did not move, and the silver balance tax announcement also did not fluctuate. After this, there were numerous wheat settlement transactions. A certain foreign firm absorbed HSBC, Jardine Matheson's British gold at 8 pence 2.03125 and 1.875. Subsequently, foreign banks also bought Hong Kong telegrams and British gold at 8 pence 2.03125. Later, a certain foreign firm settled and bought only 15 yuan and 9375 jiao of the Chinese-Belgian American exchange rate, so the process was quite tight. Near noon, the money exchange business sold Dutch Hong Kong exchange at 54 yuan and 5 jiao to Anda, so the trend was slightly flat. In the afternoon, the bank's selling price was 8 pence 1.71875 for the British exchange rate and 5 yuan and 9375 jiao for the US exchange rate.</p>
<p>Later, it was suddenly heard from Reuters that the UK would continue to lend China HK$60 million, and Hong Kong telegrams first came to sell to Yili, HSBC, and Jardine Matheson's British gold at 8 pence 1.875 and US$16, so the process slightly recovered. After this, the underlying trend hardened again because foreign firms scooped up again. Foreign firms ate HSBC, Jardine Matheson at 8 pence 1.71875 and US$15 yuan and 9375 jiao. Finally, the money exchange firms frequently sold Hong Kong exchange, selling Dutch and China Justice Hong Kong exchange at 54 yuan and half and 75 jiao, so the situation was slightly flat. The bank's selling price was the same as the midday closing price until the late closing: 8 pence 1.71875 for the British exchange rate and 15 yuan and 9375 jiao for the US exchange rate. As a result, the British exchange rate was tighter by 0.03125 and the US exchange rate was softer by 0.09375 compared to the previous day's midday closing, while Hong Kong was flat.</p>
<h3>Textiles: White Goods and Fine Twill: Chinese Factories Receive Huge Orders, East Goods Speculators Have High Spirits</h3>
<p>The current sales of domestic cloth in the southwest are still quite considerable. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants added nearly 100 boxes of light-colored cloth, printed cloth, and satin. Guangdong merchants have recently been actively purchasing white goods and fine twill. There is also demand for dyed blanks in this street. However, due to the large orders received by various Chinese factories, the production of fine twill has decreased, and the amount of inventory on the market has gradually become scarce. The price has also increased by about 1 jiao (per bolt). Yesterday, Guangdong merchants purchased about 50 pieces of various brands. Merchants in this street purchased more than 100 pieces, priced at 11 yuan to 11 yuan and 6 jiao. Fujian merchants continued to purchase more than 60 pieces of colored twill, blue cloth, line wool, and serge. Yantai merchants on the northern route purchased 40 to 50 boxes of serge and bleached cloth. Wholesale shops in this street purchased nearly 50 bales of current goods of Dapeng, Peacock, and Fumei fine cloth. 200 boxes of Hongzhang Sanyang striped silk for March and April futures are priced at 4 jiao and 8 fen per yard.</p>
<p>The East Cloth market continues to be good. Fellow merchants are more and more excited about business. Speculators and dyeing factories in this street have searched for more than 1,000 pieces of current goods of fine cloth and fine twill. The sales prices have all increased by 5 fen to 7 and a half fen (per bolt). The current price of Longtou fine cloth is 11 yuan and 9 jiao, while the order price for March and April futures of East cotton is 12 yuan and 2 and a half jiao (per bolt). Others such as Caiqiu Flying Fish still need to be increased by 5 fen, (per bolt) selling at 12 yuan 2 and a half to 3 jiao. In total, each shop has continued to sell about 500 to 600 pieces.</p>
<h3>Food: Guest Xian Rice Sales Are Still Active, Dumi Transactions Are Limited</h3>
<p>Guest Xian rice was affected by the fall of the original tip this morning, and buyers were waiting and watching. Transactions were less than 1,000 bags, and the market suddenly showed a weak trend. By the afternoon, speculators suddenly absorbed the low prices, and more than 2,000 sentences were agreed one after another. The market shape immediately turned from weak to easy. All the high-grade goods were called up by one angle. Nanjing High Xian goods were missing and not opened. High Wu Xian was raised to 10 yuan and 098 jiao, and Da Shi goods was 10 yuan and 023 jiao. If the hoarding is not declining now and tomorrow, then there is still the possibility of a step-up in the later market, it is said.</p>
<p>The source of domestic rice has arrived at He Xia No. 4, with more than 2,000 bags of wheel car buns. The Lunar New Year is approaching, and most of the trading parties are engaged in closing. Therefore, yesterday's local sales turned slack, hoarders stopped, and transactions on the market were limited. As a result, the market was in a stalemate. The price of thick and thin japonica rice was high, and the materials were all unchanged. Only the mid-grade goods were sold widely at low prices, and a few more fen to one jiao were added. The market for Du Yangjian and Butujian japonica rice was stable. The high-priced goods are still opened at 15 yuan, but the eyes of the next delivery are falling. It is heard that the rice market business is allowed to engage in closing and holidays from the 14th. Therefore, there are only four days from today, and it will reopen on the red market next spring. Therefore, there will not be much change in the market in these days.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales to Nanyang Still Strong, More Than 10,000 Bags Shipped to Shantou Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market trend was from stable to firm. The recent customer sales have been good, and the scattered sales of Nanyang merchants are more enthusiastic than those of Beiyang merchants. This is because foreign wheat imports in Nanyang are still taxed, so the demand for Shen flour is still strong, while in Beiyang, local foreign flour is dumped, and it is difficult to expect smooth sales for a while. The factory still lacks current inventory, and its selling intention is quite firm. The No. 1 flour factory's market is firmly stationed at 4 yuan and 8 jiao of the original market. The unified market transactions still have more than 8,000 bags. The North and South merchants each loaded nearly 10,000 bags. The price of the lower foot powder market is rising, and there is still no proper transaction.</p>
<p>Today, there are 14,200 bags of flour shipped to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Australian Flour Also Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities, High-Priced Wheat Prices Increase</h3>
<p>The wheat market shows no special development. The sources of supply from various places have fallen recently. Yesterday, 500 bags came from Xin Gang. The inventory in the Shanghai market is also thin. At this time when there are few inventories, the factory will gradually have sufficient raw materials for flour production and plans to wait until next year to do it again, so the market has already presented a closing scene. The unified market sells a kind of high-grade Jiangbei wheat, with an amount of 1,300 bags. The Fuxin factory handles 300 bags, and the Fuxin factory handles 1,000 sentences, priced at 6 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen, which is another 5 fen higher than before. According to the current arrival of foreign wheat from various factories, it is necessary to match domestic high-grade wheat, so the price of high-grade materials is increased. The middle and inferior grade goods are not eaten by the factory stomach, and the market is still flat.</p>
<p>The source of US wheat has been reported in this newspaper many times. Now it is learned that Australian flour has also arrived in large quantities. The Janda and Co., managed by the Great Britain Company, imported 2,000 tons of wheat flour from Australia on the 8th (the day before yesterday), totaling more than 50,000 bags. Although this kind of wheat flour is often loaded, it has never been as much as this time, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn and Cloth Waiting Quietly for Closing, Speculators Are Still Dragging in When Prices Fall, Real Sales Business Remains Silent</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned clearer, because it is the end of the year and people are quiet, and all parties are busy closing, and there is no intention to do business. Therefore, the transaction is terribly silent. Because there are not many ships traveling and the number of flights to the customer side during the year, they must wait for the new spring to develop the layer of doing business. As for the speculators, they have been eating in for days, and the amount is already considerable. At present, their intention is slightly slack, and they are not anxious to search for it. However, when the price falls, they still come to seize cheap goods, so 20-count Shuangma broke the 400 yuan mark. A certain XX came to absorb it again, and by the time of closing, it turned tight and went out of the 400 yuan mark again.</p>
<p>Selling Price Falls by Two or Three Yuan</p>
<p>In the current yarn market, the market opened early in the morning. Due to the small number of real needs transactions, there were no telegrams from customers to Shanghai, and there was a lack of entrustment. The popularity was scattered. The two sides delayed for a long time before the market opened. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 2 yuan compared to the 10th, which was 401 yuan and a half. The same industry traded 30 bales, and the Shantou merchant entered 30 bales of Tiannv, and the monk was 401 yuan. After this, the spot business remained sluggish as before, and the floating long selling intention was relaxed again and softened by one step, falling into the 400 yuan mark, but small speculators were aware of the low price and came to drag in again, and then returned to the outside of the customs. As a result, the transaction volume in the morning was 537 bales, and the actual customer sales were less than 200 sentences. The market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 3 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, while Te Jincheng fell by 2 yuan, Tiannv fell by 2 and a half yuan, Shuangdiqiu fell by 3 yuan, 10-count coarse yarn was still flat, and there was no word of any action from Guangfang. Today, there are 1,770 pieces of yarn shipped to Shantou and 80 pieces shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn Guild's Closing Market Has a Period</p>
<p>The current yarn market of the Cotton Yarn Industry Association is now agreed to stop trading from February 17 to February 23, and then resume normal trading and business, and resume afternoon trading. The meeting will be changed to a full-day business.</p>
<p>The Demand for Japanese Yarn Declines Silently</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is abnormally clear, and the number of attendees has greatly decreased. Because the end of the year has arrived, all parties have no stomach, so the market price declines by two or three yuan due to the silence of demand. The current yarn price of 20-count Shuiyue is 327 yuan, and the current yarn price of 20-count Lanfeng is 322 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Falls in the Near Term and Rises in the Far Term, Domestic Cotton Has Only Two Transactions</h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was more appraising yesterday. It rose early due to buying on Wall Street. Later, because each yarn factory deeply considered that the government's loan cotton sales would reduce market prices, it sold the previously purchased spot goods and recent goods one after another, changed to dragging on the far term. Therefore, yesterday's market price fell in the near term and rose in the far term. The New York Financial News estimated that this year's cotton field was 25,391,000 acres, which was a huge reduction of 1,058,000 acres compared to last year's government statistics of 26,449,000 acres. The exchange rate was extended at once in the morning yesterday, and then shrunk in the afternoon. Converting to legal currency, cotton prices all fell, with US cotton and Brazilian cotton falling by 3 jiao per load, Indian cotton falling by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton falling by 8 jiao per quintal.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai Port is still unusually dull. Only each factory takes advantage of this leisure time to ask each foreign firm for various cotton samples, analyzes the quality, and compares the prices, etc., as a reference for purchasing cotton in the red market. Yesterday's transaction was quiet. The cotton prices yesterday are recorded below.</p>
<p>Raw Materials Category Delivery to Factory Including Tax</p>
<p>The domestic cotton business has completely entered a state of standstill. The factory's use of Indian cotton is gradually surging, and the need for each factory is sufficient. In addition, the end of the year is approaching, and the intention of handling is quite sparse. According to the cotton merchants, there is a part that is slightly easy, but the amount is also very small. Only two batches were transacted today. The source of supply from northern Jiangsu is also rare. 736 bales of Tonghua arrived, 258 pieces from Xin Gang, 280 pieces from Beisha, and 352 pieces from Baimao. The current cotton prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>Installment Repayment Procedures for Government Bonds</h3>
<p>The sixth installment of principal and interest of the Unified Government Bonds maturing on January 31, 1939, has been clearly stipulated by the government to be paid in Chongqing, while in Shanghai, cash will be received in six installments, and Shanghai-approved certificates will be issued. For the convenience of our readers, this newspaper has investigated the receiving procedures as follows:</p>
<p>The actual receiving procedure is quite simple. First, obtain an "Application for a Permit to Exchange Government Bond Principal and Interest" from the Central Bank and fill it out item by item. Then, submit it to the Treasury Department of the Central Bank together with the principal and interest coupons of the bonds. After the Central Bank receives the application and verifies the principal and interest coupons, it will issue a temporary receipt and advance one-sixth of the amount. After receiving this temporary receipt, the holder of the bond principal and interest coupons can exchange it for a remittance permit from the Ministry of Finance and receive one-sixth of the amount from the Central Bank each month.</p>
<p>However, filling out the application forms can be cumbersome. Therefore, further explanations are provided below: For example, if a reader holds twenty 100-yuan bonds of Unified C Bonds, and the interest to be received for each bond is three yuan. Then, in the "Bond Name" field, write "Unified C," in the "Installment Number" field, write "6," in the "Principal and Interest Amount to be Received per Bond" field, write "Three Yuan," in the "Number of Bonds" field, write "Twenty," in the "Amount" field, write "Sixty Yuan," and in the "Deducted Interest or Income Tax on Interest Coupon" field, write "Three Yuan," because 60 - 3 = 57. Therefore, in the "Payable National Currency" field, write "Fifty-seven Yuan."</p>
<p>This is the simplest case. If a reader holds more than one type of Unified Government Bond, and the face value is not just 100 yuan, then they should be filled out separately for Unified A, Unified B, Unified C, Unified D, and Unified E. For the "Principal and Interest Amount to be Received per Bond" field, for a face value of ten yuan, write "Thirty cents," for a face value of one hundred yuan, write "Three yuan," for a face value of one thousand yuan, write "Thirty yuan," and for a face value of five thousand yuan, write "One hundred and fifty yuan."</p>
<p>If the Unified Government Bond held by the reader has already been drawn in a lottery, then enter the face value in the "Principal and Interest Amount to be Received per Bond" field, and leave the "Deducted Interest or Income Tax on Interest Coupon" field blank. If the winning ticket has the sixth installment interest coupon attached, then combine it with other interest coupons of the same type and amount in one line. However, if the previously won bond is collected in this period, because the sixth installment interest coupon may have been cleverly cut off, then calculate the total amount of interest coupons cut off in previous periods and enter it in the "Deducted Interest or Income Tax on Interest Coupon" field.</p>
<p>Now, let's take the government bond principal and interest due on January 31, 1939, held by Ren Da Silver Firm as an example for readers' reference. Suppose the firm holds the following principal and interest coupons:</p>
<p>Principal and interest coupons of winning bonds: 1. Unified A: ten 100-yuan bonds, two 1,000-yuan bonds. 2. Unified B: five 10-yuan bonds, two 5,000-yuan bonds.</p>
<p>Interest coupons: 1. Unified A: thirty 30-cent coupons, twenty 3-yuan coupons (including a total of thirty for winning interest), ten 30-yuan coupons (including a total of twelve for winning tickets), three 150-yuan coupons. 2. Unified B: forty 30-cent coupons (including a total of forty-five for winning tickets), twenty-five 3-yuan coupons, fifteen 30-yuan coupons, five 150-yuan coupons (including a total of seven winning interest coupons).</p>
<p>Also, 3-yuan interest coupons include fifty Unified C coupons, one hundred Unified D coupons, and twenty-five Unified E coupons.</p>
<p>The application form should be filled out as follows:</p>
<p>Government Bond Installment</p>
<p>Name Number</p>
<p>Principal and Interest Amount to be Received Per</p>
<p>Bond Number Amount (Yuan)</p>
<p>Deducted Interest or Income Tax on Interest Coupon Payable National Currency (Yuan)</p>
<p>After the Central Bank receives the application and verifies it, it will immediately issue 2,653 yuan and 56 cents in cash, and issue a temporary receipt, the format of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Note: The signatures of the Central Bank personnel in charge are affixed below "Payable First Installment Ticket" and to the right of "Central Bank of Shanghai."</p>
<p>After receiving this temporary receipt, Ren Da Silver Firm can exchange it for a remittance permit in the future, and receive one-sixth of the amount from the Central Bank each month.</p>
<p>As for the format of the remittance permit, it is said to be roughly similar to government bond interest coupons, and is cut off monthly. As of now, this remittance permit has not yet been issued.</p>
<p>Regarding the withdrawal of small amounts such as 30-cent or 3-yuan interest coupons, it has not yet occurred, because interest coupon holders would never pay for the round-trip fare and go through the cumbersome procedures for such a small amount. Most of them are sold to small money changers or firms.</p>
<h3>Fried Cakes Remote Soybean Oil Transactions Are Not Many Raw Oil Market Conditions Become Tight Both Soybean Import and Export Occur</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market, due to the approaching year-end, has seen little interest in buying and selling. Yesterday, a foreign firm was selling forward goods, although the transaction volume was not large, the market atmosphere has softened. Two hundred barrels of lower-period oil for March were traded at a price of 28 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, and the delivery price at the end of the month was also opened at 28 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, with 150 barrels traded. Two or three days of delivery were first opened at 28 yuan and 1 jiao and a half for 50 barrels, and then dropped to 27 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, with only 50 barrels traded. The current oil is quoted for more than a hundred barrels, with prices divided into 28 yuan and 2 jiao and 28 yuan.</p>
<p>Peanut oil, due to rumors of a ban on exports from Qingdao, the market has shifted from stable to tight, but the fluctuations are still small. It is difficult to be optimistic because the change comes from a certain means. Yesterday, it was calculated that 200 tins of Qingdao oil would continue to be handled with the chemical gang, with the price being the original plate of 30 yuan and 5 jiao. The local street inquired about 200 pieces of Jiaozhou basket oil, with the price being 21 yuan and 4 jiao, an increase of 2 jiao from the previous day. One hundred pieces of road goods were traded at a price of 21 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 150 pieces of soybean oil came from Yantai, and today 500 pieces of raw oil are being transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In addition, 200 bags of soybeans came from Xingang yesterday, and 700 bags are also being transported to Shantou today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Minghua Japanese Sugar Has Been Underwritten by Someone Profit Is the Only Goal, Forgetting Righteousness</h3>
<p>Five thousand packages of new Chao sugar will arrive in Shanghai today and tomorrow</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was not much change in the sugar market. The association's pricing and the firm's pricing only saw small transactions. According to Shantou gang news, new Chao sugar, both green, red, and white, has been loaded and is on its way. It is estimated that the Taikoo Company's Qingyuan Wheel has a total of about 5,000 outer packages, and it is expected to be imported today or tomorrow. New Chao green sugar is mostly transported to Oushi for sales because the market there is better, so only a few arrive in Shanghai. It is also rumored that the products of the Minghua Japanese Sugar Factory have been underwritten by someone. It can be seen that merchants seek profit and use all means to achieve their goals. However, it is appropriate to have some discretion in this matter. It must be known that buying more goods from a certain source will reduce one's own strength by a certain amount, inevitably seeing profit and forgetting righteousness, and lacking national consciousness. Those who do this will cut themselves off from the Chinese people.</p>

<h3>The Path for Educated Youths</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Originally, our country has many strong men, and there is no problem with the source of soldiers. There is no need for educated youths to join the army with guns. Therefore, Madam Soong Mei-ling recently published an article saying that students only need to directly or indirectly awaken the anti-Japanese consciousness of the Chinese people during the war, and improve the lives of the people, which is enough.</p>
<p>However, these words are Madam Soong's intention to care for educated youths, that is, the path for educated youths to serve the country is more important than being a soldier, and it is not to say that they absolutely do not need to be soldiers. Therefore, if we combine her words with Chairman Chiang's order a few days ago to encourage the children of party and government officials to join the army, we can discover that their intentions are exactly the same: every educated youth should take responsibility for saving the country, either going to the front line to fight, or engaging in national salvation movements in the rear.</p>
<p>The children of party and government officials are of course educated youths. Since the War of Resistance, although Chiang Ching-kuo's leading troops and Feng Yuxiang's eldest son's death in Nanyuan are enough to be models for these children, there must still be a majority who are drunk and dreaming, or living in leisure and pleasure. Chairman Chiang wants them all to enlist in the army, not only to set an example for the people, but also to strengthen the strength of the War of Resistance. In fact, he has clearly designated another way for educated youths to serve the country. We support this proposal.</p>
<p>I think every educated youth, those who can go to the front line to fight should go to the front line to fight, and those who can be active in the rear should be active in the rear. These are the two paths they should take now. Studying hard, studying hard, and doing everything possible outside of class to engage in national salvation can of course be included in the scope of rear activities. Educated youths, please cherish this and do not give up your responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, in my personal opinion, it is better for educated youths to do their best on the front line than to do their best in the rear. Because hiding in the rear inevitably has the suspicion of avoiding responsibility, which will lead to the malpractice of abandoning responsibility. Once they go to the front line, I think their influence, whether on the front line or in the rear, will definitely be great. Chairman Chiang's order may have some meaningful implications!</p>
<h3>On the Road (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wall Grass</p>
<p>"Watch me beat you!" Someone shouted and threw a brick. They tucked their tails and scattered in a panic.</p>
<p>The three of us prisoners happened to walk together. The small-faced primary school teacher named Li was trembling. He was very scared and muttered to himself:</p>
<p>"I haven't committed any crime. I have always been stable, teaching to earn a living, which is also a helpless and troublesome thing!"</p>
<p>After saying that, he looked at my face as if wanting to gain some comfort, but when he saw my nonchalant look, he disappointedly averted his eyes quickly.</p>
<p>"Is that so? I haven't committed any crime. The bureau will definitely not send me to the ×× headquarters, right?" He couldn't talk to me, so he stretched his head to the ear of the rice store apprentice next to him.</p>
<p>The rice store apprentice was not yet twenty years old, and the villagers called him Xiao Zhu. He seemed honest in his behavior: he was not happy to pay attention to the small-faced primary school teacher, and only kept complaining to the fake police in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I am an apprentice! Think about it, how could I join any guerrillas? And I am a local, my family has fields and houses, and parents and brothers. How can I do this bandit-like business? I understand very well that this is a great treason that will be beheaded!"</p>
<p>"This little thing is hateful!" I bit my lip.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, please help me when we get to the bureau, explain it for me, I will definitely not forget you. If you are not at ease, I can ask someone to ask the town chief to guarantee!"</p>
<p>The primary school teacher also seemed unwilling to be lonely, and stuttered:</p>
<p>"I am the same as him, I have not committed a crime, I have a good citizen certificate; I can also ask someone to guarantee!"</p>
<p>The tall fake police officer walking slightly ahead became impatient, turned his head around:</p>
<p>"Don't worry, you can come out after staying at the bureau for a while."</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, does my appearance look like a bad person?" The rice store apprentice had a bitter smile on his face.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at him: a short body, a round and flat nose tip, a protruding forehead, but the cheeks were shrinking without any flesh, just like a monkey. This funny appearance made everyone laugh; on the one hand, it seemed to break the silence, and everyone deliberately prolonged their laughter for a while.</p>
<p>The buck-toothed beard in the back noticed and raised his voice to rebuke:</p>
<p>"What are you making noise about? No noise allowed!"</p>
<p>The thin white pockmark also followed with the same tone:</p>
<p>"Enough, what are you still laughing about?"</p>
<p>In fact, by the time he spoke, no one wanted to laugh anymore.</p>
<p>In a silence, someone began to complain again:</p>
<p>"It's really a living ghost! Making a fuss about nothing, saying that there is a large guerrilla team holding a secret meeting, loading bullets, inserting bayonets, ha, damn it, just these three! Their expressions don't even look real!"</p>
<p>"My legs were weak at first, but now it's fine!" One of them seemed to just catch a breath.</p>
<p>"But we got soaked in such a big rain!"</p>
<p>The sky quickly darkened, and the villages, forests, and vague ones became hideous giants. Everyone became silent and moved their feet faster. The rice store apprentice was still mumbling and complaining, but no one paid attention to him. The thin white pockmark raised his throat and urged me:</p>
<p>"Hurry up! Hurry up!"</p>
<p>His rude echoes burst out in the rainy night air.</p>

<h3>Fire</h3>
<p>— Ying Jin</p>
<p>Children love fire because fire has a mysterious element; old men love fire because fire temporarily recalls their youth; young people love fire because fire is full of vigorous vitality, with light, strength, and heat.</p>
<p>I am a young man, and like other young people, I also love fire.</p>
<p>However, my love of fire is not just these.</p>
<p>Although fire can destroy, it is an enlightenment of new life; although it can burn, it is a necessity for construction; although it can turn beautiful cities into scorched earth, it can also build a noble paradise of freedom on the scorched earth!</p>
<p>Also: intangible anger can also emit great power, burning away all the doubts and despicable dregs in mankind.</p>
<p>Fire is great, it is sacred and inviolable!</p>
<p>So, I love fire even more.</p>

<h3>People with Disabilities</h3>
<p>— Jun Pei</p>
<p>There is a saying: "A blind person is vicious, a mute person has a knife in their belly!" This means that people with disabilities are the most sinister, and it is best not to provoke them. If you provoke them, or they provoke you, you should defend yourself well and not fall for their "poison," "trickery," or "knife."</p>
<p>Why are people with disabilities like this? This is nothing more than that they have defects, blame heaven and others, and are uneasy inside. Over time, they accumulate evil thoughts: on the one hand, they hate themselves for being born with disabilities, which cannot be completely hidden, and on the other hand, they are jealous of others for being well in front of them, and their stomachs are full of complaints and dissatisfaction, just hating that there is no place to vent; if anyone, intentionally or unintentionally, mentions some of their defects, they will naturally be ashamed and angry, and anger will arise from the heart and evil will arise from the gallbladder!</p>
<p>In short, a distorted body cultivates an abnormal psychology. In fact, people with disabilities do not need to cover up at all, let alone feel sorry for themselves, and especially do not need to resent others, wanting to get what they want. As long as they use their strengths and develop their special talents, they can also make achievements and make a difference, making people forget their shortcomings. And everyone has certain special talents. Not to mention the distant ones, for example, Goebbels was a cripple and became the Minister of Propaganda of Germany, and Avicenna was blind and became a world-famous poet. Otherwise, "a pockmarked face applying powder, depleting the old capital"; big feet wearing small shoes, and small feet wearing big shoes, not only do not look beautiful, but appropriately show the disgusting ugliness; and red eyebrows and green eyes, opening a bloody mouth, just wanting to eat people, will one day commit public anger and be beaten to death by a random stick.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, today's distorted body specializes in cultivating an abnormal psychology, and an abnormal psychology specializes in emitting crazy actions. Moreover, this kind of crazy action applied to one person and one thing is less harmful, but today's crazy action is often applied to a country and a nation, and the harm is immeasurable. This really makes people stomp their feet and sigh, and shout helplessly! Don't you believe it? Listen to me:</p>
<p>It is said that Napoleon's militarism was because he had incurable tinea on his belly, couldn't sleep at night, and couldn't get the favor of the princess of the country, so he took a risk. Huang Chao overthrew the Tang Dynasty and killed eight million people, because he was ugly when he went to Beijing to take the exam and couldn't get the top spot, so he rebelled in anger.</p>
<p>There are such people now. It is said that—helplessly, I can only say that, a high-ranking person, because he is a eunuch, can't get close to women all his life, and his heart is depressed, cultivating a strange temper, so the things he does, such as driving people to move, are mostly sinister and vicious, and not close to "humanity". Another high-ranking person, just meeting the conditions of "big head and thin feet, not interesting to raise", and a chin raised up, just like a tile cake, can be compared to Zhu Hongwu, and he has been looked down upon by people since he was a child, suffering a lot of resentment. Once he gains power, he robs openly and secretly, cheats and hard-knocks. Finally, there is also a high-ranking person, who is a "three-inch Ding, bark of a tree", and has never been taken seriously by people. So he climbed high everywhere and strived to go upstream. Although he earned some face in the end, he was still dissatisfied and did not hesitate to act perversely, harming lives, and妄想想to achieve his "跌金剛"purpose.</p>
<p>These three people, three people with disabilities, are said to be in the limelight, with the air of being invincible and unique. However, we can predict that their results will not be better than Napoleon or Huang Chao.</p>
<p>Because their crazy actions are not much different from those of Napoleon and Huang Chao.</p>
<p>Foreigners also have a saying: "A sound mind resides in a sound body." This can also be used to prove that people with physical disabilities are mentally unsound. Let's strive to be strong ourselves, and at the same time prevent people with disabilities!</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>At this time, a burst of rapid footsteps suddenly came from the courtyard outside, and a orderly soldier, panting, rushed straight into the room, stood at attention in front of Regiment Commander Ye, and gave a military salute.</p>
<p>"Reporting to the Regiment Commander..."</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye's face changed, and he hurriedly jumped up and asked:</p>
<p>"What's happening at the front?"</p>
<p>"Reporting to the Regiment Commander, Shihudang has fallen, and the enemy is attacking Fengjing Jiashan, which is very close to our defense area."</p>
<p>"Then go back quickly and tell Deputy Regiment Commander Liang and Battalion Commander Zhao, don't just defend, occupy the positions as soon as possible, choose favorable terrain, and fight the enemy, try to block them, don't let them rush over. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Understood!" The orderly soldier responded and ran back. Before he ran out of the courtyard, Regiment Commander Ye shouted at him from behind:</p>
<p>"Remember, pay special attention to the northeast. Tell them, I'll be right there."</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye hurriedly went into the room to pack up, put the briefcase under his arm, and waved goodbye to everyone in the room, saying:</p>
<p>"I'm leaving, don't panic, this place will probably be okay for a while."</p>
<p>"Fang Jun, be careful in front, come back when the war is over." Madam Ye's voice was a little choked, with two bags of clear tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye smiled slightly, as if laughing at his mother's lack of knowledge, how could she hope for the end when the war was just beginning. But at the same time, he also realized that this was a loving mother's love for her son, and he was deeply moved, and his face quickly darkened.</p>
<p>Fang Ying and Fang Hui grabbed their brother's arm again.</p>
<p>"Brother, can you go to the front with us now?"</p>
<p>"No, I have to run to the front line now, you can't run fast." Regiment Commander Ye said annoyedly, shaking off his younger siblings.</p>
<p>"I can run fast, I won first place in the running competition at the county sports meeting last time, believe it or not, let's try." Fang Ying said proudly.</p>
<p>"It's useless even if you run fast. Now the military situation at the front is urgent. I have to command the battle and don't have time to arrange you. Please wait for a while. As long as there is an opportunity, I will send someone to pick you up."</p>
<p>"Fang Ying, don't pester your brother." Old Master Ye also scolded from the side, waving his hand to Regiment Commander Ye and saying, "Go, so as not to delay military affairs."</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye responded and ran out like a whirlwind. (9)</p>

<h3>The Crisis of a Man Who Has Contracted a Hidden Illness and Hides It After Marriage!</h3>
<p>Good that wants people to see is not true good, evil that fears people to know is great evil. Having a hidden illness and hiding it will eventually become a serious illness. Hiding illness is a common problem of Chinese people, especially when they have a hidden illness, they keep the secret in a sneaky way and never tell anyone, not even their wives. Once his wife or others see through it, they still use a set of nonsense such as "a gentleman does not like this way" or "cultivating oneself" to deceive people. There is also a kind of person who infects his wife with a hidden illness, but says that his wife infected him, which is even more a loss of personality.</p>
<p>What is a hidden illness? Smart people can know without explanation. Why do so many men in today's society have this kind of hidden illness? According to the judgment of doctors, half of it is because the moral standards of society are declining and tending towards the path of pornography; half of it is because young people are not deeply worldly-wise and have weak wills. Once tempted to be lustful without limit, polygamy and indulgence cause the sexual function to be severely injured and the fluid of the reproductive glands to dry up. Then, symptoms such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency and impotence, scattered energy, infertility after a long marriage, and neurasthenia arise one after another. That is not only unable to satisfy the normal sexual life between husband and wife, causing the wife to hate it, and causing cracks in the love between husband and wife. If these cracks are not quickly repaired, the cracks will become larger and larger, just like the earth is splitting, which can destroy everything! Therefore, it is common for couples to separate or families to be destroyed because of this! In addition, because they hide their illness and do not seek treatment, or cannot be treated thoroughly, the condition worsens, causing brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, overall weakness and fatigue. This not only confines them to depression and pain all day long, but they also achieve nothing and have no interest in life, and will lead to premature aging and premature disability. How dangerous is this!</p>
<p>The so-called "you know your illness yourself." Once you discover a disease, if you are unmarried and have parents, you must inform your parents as soon as possible and ask them to pay for medical treatment, or take medicine for self-healing. If you are married and self-reliant, you must discuss it with your wife or good friends and strive for the most appropriate and effective treatment method. Otherwise, rushing to the doctor in desperation and taking medicine indiscriminately is also very dangerous, because quack doctors or similar drugs abound in the market. Taking aphrodisiacs by mistake, although it may be exciting for a while, will damage the function more severely. Like the effect of prescribing medicine for the disease, the longer the disease is delayed, the more deeply the root of the disease will penetrate. This is something that must be deeply noted. According to world-famous doctors and my many years of experience, for the above-mentioned diseases, it is generally recognized that taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" is the most appropriate and effective. Therefore, this agent can produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate blood, and nourish nerves within one day and night after taking it, so that the symptoms are reduced. If you continue to take it, you can completely restore your health in a short period of time. If taken for a long time, it can make the body twice as strong and healthy, and have the effect of returning to youth. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hymit's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the essence and stop the leakage, so that the effect can be more rapid; but if patients can come to this clinic in person for diagnosis by expert doctors, and use various specialties such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Common Diseases of Young People</p>
<h3>Neglected Nocturnal Emission!</h3>
<p>— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nian-zeng</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission, in terms of its symptomatic severity, is much milder than various acute illnesses, but in terms of health and happiness, it is far more painful than various acute illnesses. This is because acute illnesses such as typhoid fever, scarlet fever, meningitis, and appendicitis, while they come on violently and pose a threat to life, can be treated effectively, turning danger into safety within a few days without causing much suffering. Nocturnal emission, however, is quite different. While its sudden and violent onset is relatively rare, the damage it inflicts on the patient's health and the deprivation of youthful happiness are more severe than any acute or chronic illness.</p>
<p>Its most prominent symptoms are dizziness, headache, back pain, tinnitus, palpitations, weak memory, aversion to noise and preference for quiet, lack of courage and decisiveness, hesitation in the face of challenges, inability to concentrate, and a gradual decline in judgment and memory. For those who are engaged in writing, their literary inspiration often feels barren, and they are listless and dispirited all day long. However, these are just the most common general symptoms. If the patient has a pre-existing habit of masturbation or frequent emissions and still neglects to seek treatment, the resulting tragedy is even more unspeakable!</p>
<p>Semen is a vital glandular fluid that nourishes the entire body, while masturbation is a destructive act that damages the gonads and weakens the sperm gate. If repeated and becomes a habit, the sperm gate will relax, and nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea will inevitably erupt, affecting the sexual nerves and leading to various symptoms such as incomplete development, local underdevelopment, and premature ejaculation. Such patients, on the surface, may eat and excrete normally, but the pain in their hearts is truly beyond the comprehension of outsiders!</p>
<p>Effective treatment for this condition is not difficult in today's era of advanced medicine and therapeutics. As long as the patient is determined to abstain from masturbation and takes the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductin," allowing the reproductive glands to regain prosperity and enhancing the function of metabolism and continuous endocrine production, all symptoms of weakness will naturally disappear. However, those who have pre-existing nocturnal emission or spermatorrhea before taking the medication must simultaneously use "Hemitol Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" to strengthen their sperm gate, so that leakage is blocked and the nourishing effect can be manifested.</p>

<h3>Breast Development and Female Beauty</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chong-pei</p>
<p>Promoting Breast Development is the Only Secret to Creating Female Beauty</p>
<p>In a physiologically mature and well-developed state, every young woman should have a graceful and healthy figure. This figure includes a slender body, distinct curves, and, especially, prominent breasts that stand tall in a double-peaked formation. As for a face with fair and rosy skin, lively and spirited eyes, dark and cloud-like hair, and a smiling expression... that is, of course, also very important. In the past, we judged a woman's beauty solely based on her face, which is absolutely wrong! Because the face is only a small part of the whole body, a truly beautiful woman must have a healthy and beautiful physique in addition to a beautiful face. Therefore, women with poor development and fading complexions should no longer spend excessive effort on their faces. They must work from the root, that is, save some money on cosmetics and quickly purchase the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductin," which can not only promote developmental function and make the breasts stand tall but also help its metabolism, making the skin fresh and rosy, so that both body and face can be dazzlingly beautiful. Moreover, hidden ailments such as irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, frigidity, and infertility can be fundamentally cured, and there is hope for childbirth. With this good medicine, women can have the art of beauty and health, and have no worries about all diseases. Therefore, this medicine has long been popular all over the world, enjoying a high reputation, and is sold in all pharmacies.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea Forum</p>

<h3>Why is Leukorrhea Difficult to Cure?</h3>
<p>Taking Only Over-the-Counter Medicine, Of Course It's Difficult to Cure!</p>
<p>Relying Only on Superficial Medical Treatment, Especially Difficult to Cure!</p>
<p>The Unreliability of Taking Only Over-the-Counter Medicine. The most common and most difficult-to-cure disease in society is generally considered to be leukorrhea, a venereal disease. In fact, leukorrhea is not difficult to cure, but the reason why it is difficult to cure is that when patients are first infected, they experience burning in the urethra, frequent urination, pus discharge, and local swelling. At this time, they are anxious to seek treatment and often do not have time to choose carefully, relying only on the glaring advertisements in the newspaper, buying one or two boxes of over-the-counter medicine, and swallowing them privately. Initially, the disease seems to be slightly reduced, and they think that they can rest easy, but they do not know that they have made a big mistake. Gonococci sneak into the posterior urethra and gradually spread to the testicles, seminal vesicles, prostate, and other places, wreaking havoc. From then on, they take deep root and become chronic gonorrhea. This is a common mistake that patients make!</p>
<p>The Unreliability of Superficial Medical Treatment. Secondly, the lack of carefulness in medical treatment is also a major reason for the difficulty in curing this disease. Recently, science has become increasingly advanced, and medical equipment is also becoming more complete, but general city doctors still adhere to the old methods of ten years ago, using extremely simple equipment to examine patients, and then boast about their rich experience. They only do superficial work and go through the motions. How can leukorrhea be quickly cured in this way? This doctor has been practicing for more than ten years, and for the treatment of gonorrhea, in addition to equipping himself with the latest ultra-shortwave electrotherapy machine, theta-wave electrotherapy machine, urethral examination mirror, and bladder reflection mirror, as well as effective needles and medicines, he has also purchased at a high price the "German Filter-Lymphatic Flat-Flow Electrotherapy Machine" to add a unique touch to the treatment of gonorrhea in Shanghai. Whether it is new or old leukorrhea, this doctor carefully examines where the bacteria are located and treats them separately. He is confident that with such responsibility and such medication, what difficulty is there in curing leukorrhea?</p>

<h3>China Apples</h3>
<p>— (Ge Er)</p>
<p>Our "friendly nation" used to use "China apples" to lure their elementary school students when they were educating them, telling them that to eat "China apples," they must "conquer China." --This is a story that our teacher often told us when I was an elementary school student, meaning that we elementary school students should protect our "apples" and prevent others from invading them!</p>
<p>Now I am in my twenties, and those "elementary school students" in our "friendly nation" are of course the same age as me, and they are now putting into practice the "education" that their teachers gave them on weekdays, coming to China to eat "China apples."</p>
<p>But have they "eaten" them?</p>
<p>The answer is very disappointing for them: that is -- they have not eaten them, or, some have "eaten" them, but that will not last long. Because of this, they are eating very hastily. When they are "wolfing down" like this, they will certainly not think of a Chinese folk tale, which is the story of the greedy frog that burst its belly.</p>
<p>However, even though they have "eaten" them, and they are eating so hastily, after all, it is only a "small number" of "minorities"! The "majority" of people not only have not "eaten" them, but have lost their lives for those few "greedy frogs"! Therefore, those "duped" who have not yet lost their lives (I can only say "duped," and in fact, they are truly "duped"!) are beginning to doubt the "education" that their teachers taught them in childhood: "China apples" will not be "eaten" by us, what we have "eaten" is actually "China bullets"! And those who are eating "China apples" are not squatting on the corpses of our countless deceived "greedy people" eating? And they are eating so hastily, so greedily, regardless of the capacity of their stomachs, always "eating," "eating."... Yes, they also see that the result of those "minorities" "eating" is still not "eating," because they have "eaten" and burst their bellies, and the "apples" are unharmed!</p>
<p>Therefore, the newspaper has such news appearing.</p>
<p>First item: "Anti-war sentiment is rising in Japan. Small groups have been established in the invading Chinese army. There was once a mutiny in Dagu."...</p>
<p>Second item: "Anti-war slogans are posted all over the Nanshi Japanese naval shipyard. Because of the discovery of this situation, ideological inspections have been carried out on a large scale for days, so most of the Japanese workers have been transferred to the front lines."...</p>
<p>Third item: "Japanese people come to Shanghai to make a living, harboring extravagant hopes, but as a result, very few obtain jobs, so they have flocked to the job placement department of the Japanese Residents Association, thus causing the Residents Association to have difficulty coping!"...</p>
<p>Enough! Enough! If we wanted to extract such news items as the above since August 13th, we could compile a book, but enough! As long as we "hold on," the greedy frog's belly will burst one day!</p>

<h3>Calligraphy and Environment (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Xiao-bai</p>
<p>The environment of calligraphy. Its content is very broad. The "human" aspect. The "material" aspect. The temporal aspect. The human environment First, the father or brother in the family must understand calligraphy. (School education will be discussed in another article.) Because the most important thing about calligraphy is method and approach. How can methods be explored? How can approaches be found? It is necessary to rely on a qualified instructor to provide guidance. If the father or brother understands calligraphy, then the children will know how to hold the brush in calligraphy, how to arrange the environment, how to choose rubbings, what to start with first, and how to improve on them. What is the appropriate approach? What are the shortcomings? How should they be reformed? What are the advantages? How should they be encouraged? There are appropriate methods for separate facilities. This is what is commonly called "family learning origin." With a family learning origin, and then with the edification of a famous teacher and the mutual learning of good friends, even if one cannot become a master, at least one can enter the right path. Therefore, "the son of a good smith is always a good smith. The son of a good furrier is always a good furrier." The son of a good calligrapher is always a good calligrapher. Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi, father and son, and Ouyang Xun and Ouyang Tong, father and son, are very obvious examples. And the sons of farmers, workers, and merchants often cannot excel in calligraphy because their father or brother has no research in calligraphy at all. Thus, whether the father or brother is good at calligraphy or not, and the quality of calligraphy, are they not of great importance? Secondly, one must have a good teacher. A teacher is one who teaches and solves doubts. Therefore, if we want to improve in our studies, we must rely on the guidance of a famous teacher to be successful. In the past, Zhong Yao taught Lady Wei, and Lady Wei taught Wang Xizhi. In recent times, from the founding of the Republic of China to the fifth year, Mr. Zai Ketang was in charge of teaching calligraphy at the First Normal School of Jiangsu Province. Mr. Wu Liangzhe was in charge of teaching calligraphy at the Second Normal School. At the Second Normal School, Mr. Hua Wan'an and Mr. Huang Danru were in charge of teaching calligraphy. At that time, the students of the three normal schools followed the trend. Talents emerged in large numbers. When they graduated and took up teaching positions, they were all able to cope with ease. And the elementary school students cultivated by these people all had a considerable level. As for the author, his family has been in business for generations, so there is no family learning to speak of. When I was studying at a private school, the teachers taught me to trace and copy and to copy rubbings. And the rubbings I copied were the rubbings of Huang Ziyuan that I bought from a book stall. The teachers did not comment and let it be. When I entered elementary school, the teachers had a higher level of calligraphy, but they were too subjective. Because they had benefited from Ouyang Xun's Nine-fold Palace Tablet, they used the Nine-fold Palace Tablet as the goal of calligraphy. They did not ask what the student's writing style was like. If the student changed to practice other rubbings, it was absolutely not allowed. It was strictly forbidden. But the author's writing style and the Nine-fold Palace were incompatible. It is funny to say that the more effort I put in, the more I felt like I was regressing. When I entered the normal school, the calligraphy teachers regarded the Regular Script as the Xuanmi Pagoda Tablet and the Running Script as the Preface to the Orchid Pavilion as gospel. Although I made some progress in the middle, I eventually stopped practicing from time to time because I had no confidence in holding the brush. After graduating and taking up a teaching position, I did not dare to have any hope for calligraphy. Therefore, I put the rubbings on the shelf. Unexpectedly, in the fifth year of the Republic of China, when I was teaching in Liangxi, there were many colleagues who were good at calligraphy and could write freely. I could not help but feel ashamed. I had to work hard myself. I was fortunate to have Mr. Yan Yaoqing, the Taifu, visit me from time to time. After tea and wine, he would always ask me about calligraphy. After his instructions, I was given rubbings. I suddenly saw the light. Mr. Yaoqing was a famous scholar in Xibei. Since I had received his favor, how could I not work harder? So I resolutely corrected my past mistakes and followed Mr. Yaoqing's policy in everything. Every night, when it was quiet, I would spread out paper, moisten the brush, and practice for two hours. In less than a year, the results were remarkable. This was the era of my environmental transformation. Up to now, I have achieved some success. When drinking water, I think of the source. I really cannot but give credit to Mr. Yaoqing. If I had not met Mr. Yaoqing at that time, I would have been groping in the dark, pulling from the east and grabbing from the west, without any target. Although I had the heart to practice seriously, but without appropriate methods and appropriate approaches, how could I have achieved anything? This is why a famous teacher is really indispensable in the study period. Secondly, one must have beneficial friends. "The foolish have a thousand thoughts, and must have one gain. The wise have a thousand thoughts, and must have one loss." Therefore, friends with rich knowledge are enough to benefit me. Even friends with a lack of knowledge have one gain in a thousand thoughts, which is enough to supplement my knowledge. The same is true of calligraphy. During conversations, one can often gain a smattering of knowledge. For example, Li Meiyang and Zeng Qingran in recent times. When they were in Peiping, they ate at the same table and slept in the same bed. They went out in the same car. What they usually discussed was nothing but calligraphy. The books they bought were nothing but fragments of rubbings. Once the rubbings were obtained, they explored them repeatedly and discussed them repeatedly. As a result, they surged upwards to the Yin and Zhou Dynasties and downwards to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. They knew everything like the back of their hands. As a result, they divided into two schools, north and south, each establishing its own banner. They developed what the predecessors had not developed and added a unique touch to the calligraphy world. This is a clear proof that practicing calligraphy must have good friends. I once said that good friends are sometimes better than good teachers. This is what I mean. If Zeng had not befriended Li, his accomplishments might not have been so profound. And in the world, there are probably countless people with the calligraphy talents of Zeng and Li, but because they have no good friends to learn from each other, their accomplishments are limited, or even without any achievement. Is this not a pity? The relationship between good friends and calligraphy is of great importance.</p>
<h3>Saintly Hero Eliminates the Wicked</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"The Saint in New York"</p>
<p>Produced by RKO Pictures, Showing at the Grand Shanghai Theater</p>
<p>We have seen many G-Men movies. The battles between detectives and bandits, the machine-gun fire, when these tense scenes are shown on the screen, they really give the audience who paid seventy cents a great satisfaction, and characters like Edward G. Robinson are also deeply imprinted on the audience's minds, but every audience also ignores the crisis lurking behind the prosperity of the gold-dollar country. Although they use this kind of film as a sign of "social stability," is "society" "stable" just because a bandit has been captured and a bandit's den has been destroyed? This kind of "attempt to cover up" is of course counterproductive.</p>
<p>Although "Saintly Hero Eliminates the Wicked" is slightly different from those G-Men movies, it is about how a "hero" calmly and unhurriedly cracks down on a gang of bandits. This writing style seems to be more clever than the former, because that "hero" is not only "brave and agile" but also a "master of flirting." For example, in "The Gay Parisian" which was also shown in the same theater, Francis Lederer and Louis Hayward are equally suave -- using this posture to eliminate treacherous bandits naturally makes the audience more sympathetic than a ruthless detective. But what is the result? This "representation" is still a failure, as "Saintly Hero Eliminates the Wicked" tells the audience that the leader of the bandit gang is actually the "Chairman of the Citizens' Public Safety Maintenance Association." However, it must be said that the murder of Vakros, the "Chairman of the Citizens' Public Safety Maintenance Association," illustrates a part of the reason for the "rampancy of bandits." To "stabilize society," it is indeed necessary to "change" this "society." But letting a character similar to the "Chairman of the Citizens' Public Safety Maintenance Association" show his face is also not without some help.</p>
<p>"Saintly Hero Eliminates the Wicked" is said to be a detective novel that has recently become popular. The author is Leslie Charteris, and he is also the authority of modern mystery novelists. Therefore, this "Saintly Hero" Simon Templar is also very "mysterious," such as entering a gambling den bare-handed, etc. He is truly a character only found in detective novels.</p>
<p>Simon's shooting of Epal, the director's introduction to his first achievement, is very good: after Epal was shot, people gathered around the street. In the crowd, a black-clad monk was inspecting the dead, and finally he left sadly. This monk, who only saw his back, saw Simon and Vakros in the next scene, and Simon was just taking off his clothes; and when Simon was captured by Hemy and Leder, after the light was turned off and they fought, he jumped out of the window, but the partisans below had heard the sound and searched. Simon climbed to the roof. In these places, the director is quite clever.</p>
<p>Louis Hayward is very good at acting. His eyebrows, eyes, and cheek muscles are all expressive.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tian-xiao</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Admiring the Portrait and Remembering the Old Martyr, Opening a Literacy Class with a Little Teacher</p>
<p>As they were talking, they suddenly heard someone at the next table calling out, "Sister Dan-yun! Sister Dan-yun!" Jin Dan-yun looked back and recognized her classmate Ms. Wu Jun-su. She asked, "Why are you in Shanghai?" Wu Jun-su said, "I came yesterday and will be going back tomorrow, so I don't have time to see you." Jin Dan-yun looked over and saw three or four female companions together. Some she recognized, and some she didn't. It turned out that Ms. Wu Jun-su was also an old classmate of Jin Dan-yun. She is currently a professor at Soochow University in Suzhou and is a writer. Because her family lives in Shanghai, she often comes to Shanghai on Sundays. When they were classmates, she and Jin Dan-yun were the closest, so she came over. Lin Jian-cheng had met her before, but he had not met the two Ms. He. Jin Dan-yun could not help but introduce them to each other and asked, "When are you going back tomorrow?" Wu Jun-su said, "I'm going back in the morning, because I have a class in the afternoon at school." Jin Dan-yun said, "That's great. These two He sisters are also going to Suzhou tomorrow, so you can travel together. These two sisters have come to Shanghai for the first time and have not traveled to various places in Suzhou. Originally, I wanted to accompany them to travel around, but I am bound by my duties. Sister Jun-su! What time train are you taking tomorrow? If you travel with them, you can point out the scenery of Jiangnan along the way, which would be great." Wu Jun-su said, "I'm taking the express train at nine o'clock in the morning. If the two sisters also take this train, we'll have company on the train. Sister Dan-yun! Don't worry! I'll be a tour guide today, taking on your responsibility. When we get to Suzhou, I can accompany the two sisters to see various places. It's just that I have two hours of class in the afternoon." Jin Dan-yun said, "There's no need to accompany them on their travels. I know you're also very busy. Moreover, after passing through Suzhou, they're going to Freedom Village. They've made an appointment, and maybe Zhu Ai-ren is coming to Suzhou to pick them up." Wu Jun-su said, "Oh! Is that the female doctor Zhu Ai-ren? I know her too. Our school invited her to give a lecture on children's hygiene knowledge, which was very clear. Well then, if Dr. Zhu comes, that would be great; if Dr. Zhu doesn't come, I'll take the two sisters to Freedom Village." The two Ms. He thanked her for her kindness and agreed to take the express train at nine o'clock in the morning tomorrow. When they were about to leave, they said again, "In that case, let's meet on the train tomorrow!" (35)</p>

<h3>Isolated Island Chrysanthemum Talk</h3>
<p>— Wang Weiwo</p>
<p>——Starting with Luck and Misfortune——</p>
<p>Actors also experience luck and misfortune. Zhou Xinfang (Qilin Bao), with his hoarse voice, has surprisingly become so famous. Although Xinfang's success was not accidental, the decision to promote or not promote him was not without influence.</p>
<p>In the early years, Zhou Xinfang was not the only actor in Shanghai who could earn money. Bai Yukun, Yang Ruiting, Gai Jiaotian, and Zhao Junyu were all once very popular. But now, Bai Yukun and Zhao Junyu have gone to other places and are languishing in obscurity. Yang Ruiting has almost been reduced to a second-rate role. Although Gai Jiaotian's heroic bearing is undiminished, his fall on the stage of the Great Theater ultimately affected his skills, and compared to his heyday, there is a feeling of past and present. Only Xinfang can sing more vigorously day by day and firmly sit in the leading position among the actors of Jiangnan. This cannot be said to be luck and misfortune.</p>
<p>Taking the above few people as examples, Zhao Junyu is not worth discussing. Bai Yukun, Yang Ruiting, and Gai Jiaotian are all righteous martial male roles. The general martial male actors who have risen in Jiangnan have always learned from these three. (Take Wang Huchen and Gao Xueqiao, who have been the most famous in Jiangnan in the past ten years, for example, Wang Huchen learned from Bai Yukun, and Gao Xueqiao learned from Gai Jiaotian.) In theory, these three have become typical figures and should have had their livelihoods secured for life. Why, except for Gai Jiaotian, who can still command attention due to historical and environmental reasons, are Bai Yukun and Yang Ruiting without an audience? There is a very understandable answer: "Things must rot from within before insects breed."</p>
<p>Bai Yukun's spear and Yang Ruiting's legs are second to none in Jiangnan. Unfortunately, in recent years, both of them have made the mistake of being "lazy," so that when watching Bai Yukun's play, one cannot see Bai Yukun's spear; when watching Yang Ruiting's play, one cannot see Yang Ruiting's legs. How can this satisfy the audience? If actors cannot satisfy the audience, can they still be popular? Speaking of the two's art, they are both first-class talents in both civil and martial arts. Bai Laojiu is relatively unfortunate because he was unwilling to condescend like Yang Ruiting. After leaving the Gong Wutai, he went to Yantai to open a wharf. Yang Ruiting, on the other hand, has not joined a long-term troupe for the past one or two years. Now I heard that he has been hired by Gong Wutai. After Yang Laosi enters Gong Wutai, perhaps under the control of the environment, he will not allow those younger heroes to be beautiful in front of him, and he will grit his teeth and fight. If his teeth can always be clenched, perhaps luck can therefore have a turning point.</p>
<p>Zhao Tongzha (Furong Cao) is one of the lucky actors. Although he plays with the four famous Dan actors, he can hear about the same amount of money as the four famous Dan actors. In fact, this is not because Tong Yang's horoscope is good. The only reason is that he is not lazy in acting. So I dare to say very arbitrarily that luck and misfortune have a very close relationship with laziness and diligence.</p>
<p>Look at Lin Shusen! During his time at Rongji Great Theater, he held a prominent position, and his plays were sometimes even ahead of Gao Xueqiao's. When Jing opera actors performed at the Great Theater, Lin Shusen sang all the odd jobs. When Rongji Great Theater was renovated, Lin Laosan hung up the third sign at Gong Wutai and sang with Yun Yanxia and Zhang Ruting for a while. After leaving Gong Wutai, he did not perform in Shanghai for three years. The year before last, he appeared on the same stage with Gai Jiaotian at the Gengxin Theater and suddenly became a first-class popular actor. Half of this is of course due to Shulin's efforts, but in the final analysis, it is still because Shulin is serious about acting. Shulin's skills are not as good as Yukun and Ruiting, but he is not as lazy as them, so the current Sen Shusen is more valuable than Bai Yukun and Yang Ruiting.</p>
<p>There is a martial male actor named Wang Shaolou at Gong Wutai. This gentleman has been performing in Hangzhou. After coming to Shanghai, he became popular because of his "aggressive" performance, and he invisibly overwhelmed Gao Xueqiao, who has a long history in Shanghai and a solid reputation. In fact, in terms of art, Shaolou has occupied Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou for a long time, and his art is close to the wild. Although Xueqiao is overseas, he is ultimately better than Helou. Now Shaolou's reputation is even higher than Xueqiao's. This cannot be said to be luck and misfortune.</p>
<h3>A Brief Description of Hong Kong Film Company Productions in the Past Year (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Nie Ge, sent from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Since the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan, Hong Kong, being a place outside the war zone, has seen a daily increase in the number of people seeking refuge here, more than doubling the population. As a result, the entertainment industry has flourished even more, and the film industry in particular is like bamboo shoots after the rain. The number of new companies is very large, but most of them are engaged in speculation and profit-seeking, and have no conscience. The films they make either appeal to the audience with eroticism and sensuality, or are based on folk tales of young masters and beautiful ladies. The level of knowledge of the indigenous residents of Hong Kong is originally very low, and these films cater to their tastes. Although the media has been calling for improvement, the filmmakers turn a deaf ear. Moreover, Hong Kong's laws are particularly strict. If a film is severely criticized, even if it is justified and reasonable, the defendant will mostly fail once the filmmaker files a lawsuit. Therefore, writers dare not write as they please and launch a major attack. This is also one of the reasons why Hong Kong films cannot be improved. Although there are also patriotic films that meet the needs of the War of Resistance, they are few and far between. The following is a brief description of the film production situation of various film companies in Hong Kong in the past year. Due to space limitations, I cannot analyze the content of each film, so I will only list the film titles. It is not difficult to imagine its contents by looking at the film titles:</p>
<p>Nanyue Company: This company was founded by Zhu Qingxian. The company’s sound films, recorded using self-made Qingxian-style radios, are the best among Hong Kong companies. The products are most popular. A total of eleven films were produced in the past year, including "Seeing the Sun Again," "Seven Stars Accompany the Moon," "Romantic Rich Man," "Compatriot Brothers," "Plum Blossom Twice," "Rouge Tears" (Cantonese copy, also starring Hu Die, filmed simultaneously with Mandarin), "Magistrate Mei," "Ghost Domain" (Vietnamese film, exclusively shown in Annam), "Eighth Heaven," "General Peach Blossom," and "Wonderful Woman." The filming of "Peach and Plum Competing for Spring," starring Xue Juesheng, is underway.</p>
<p>Nanyang Company: This company is currently headed by Shao Cunren, the second brother of Shao Zuiweng of Tianyi Company. It is one of the Hong Kong film companies with the highest output last year, with a total of 21 films, including "Double Happiness," "Flying General of Dragon City," "Storms on the Pacific," "Spendthrift Son," "Rickshaw Humiliation," "Woman's Sutra," "Broken Ganoderma," "Film World Romance," "Purple Rosy Cup," "Female Warrior," "Three Mothers Drawing Water," "June Snow," "Bittersweet," "Sacrificing Son to Serve Mother-in-law," "Pipa Ballad," "Camera Demon," "Roaring Winds and Clouds," "Night Light Cup," "Soul-Stealing Sister," "Liu Manling," and "Flirty Mouth." The new films being filmed include "Romantic Hell" and "Modern Idiot."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Amateur Drama Association's fourth public performance is scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 12th at the Green Reality Theater. The plays will be "Little Husband," "Awakening," and "The Third Miss's Profession." These three one-act plays are based on the current women's issues in China and were written successively by Zhang Min, Gong Min, You Jing, and others. The plots are lively and are all "Bitter Laixi Ge."</p>
<p>(1) "Little Husband" writes about the bad habit of "valuing men over women" in the old society, and describes the tragic experiences of women in the old society with a satirical and spicy tone.</p>
<p>(2) "Awakening" writes about the life of a female writer, and has a flavor of Ibsen's "Nora."</p>
<p>(3) "The Third Miss's Profession" uses a common story in a metropolis to raise the seriousness of the current women's employment issue.</p>
<p>This time, the Association is staging these three major "women's issues" plays with the most cautious attitude and the most meticulous rehearsals. The performance results can be expected.</p>
<h3>Yiyou Drama Troupe to Perform "Thunderstorm"</h3>
<p>Recently, the "isolated island" situation has become very "unisolated," especially in the theater world. It is heard that on February 13th and 12th, the Yiyou Drama Troupe, a legitimate entertainment group with more than 2,000 young friends, will also perform "Thunderstorm" at the Golden Grand Theatre.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhi, the director of "The Beginning of Man," is directing "Thunderstorm" this time, which is good news for the audience who likes opera. We can imagine that the performance of "Thunderstorm" will not disappoint us by the results of the performance of "The Beginning of Man". As for actors such as Zhang Jie, Chen Zhong, Yi Li, Man Wu, Wu Jing, Ye Lu, etc., they all have a not short theatrical history, and they have been well received in Qingdao and Shanghai Drama Art Society and other performances such as "Women's Apartment" and "The Struggle of Love and Death".</p>

<p>Round Twelve Opening Game</p>
<p>Black Moves First</p>
<p>Central Cannon Against Screen Horse (Straight Chariot Method)</p>
<p>Moves following Round Eleven</p>
<p>Pawn Five to Four Change Pawn Five Advance One Horse Three Advance Five Horse Three Advance Five Horse Five Advance Six Chariot One Retreat Two Horse Six Advance Five Elephant Seven Advance Five Cannon Eight Advance Two Horse Five Advance Four Chariot One Advance Two Explanation</p>
<p>From Cannon Two to Five to the Red side's Horse Two Advance Three, both sides are opening official moves that have been explained before, Pawn Five Advance One, a powerful charge, competing for the lead with the central cannon, the main method, Scholar Four Advance Five, a supplemental move, then Pawn Five Advance One across the river, the purpose is to disrupt the opponent's line, ensuring that the opponent's central pawn cannot exist safely, because the central pawn is the first gate to protect the screen, removing the central pawn allows the Chariot advancing Six to gain momentum, while attacking the middle road, the men and horses can also take advantage of the momentum to advance, which is the urgent method of advancing the central cannon, Cannon Two Advance One to defend important roads, watching how the opponent advances, Pawn Five to Four leave the pawn, Pawn Seven Advance One to attack the chariot and capture the pawn, Pawn Four Advance One leave the pawn, Horse Three Advance Four to capture the pawn, Chariot Two to Three to capture the horse, Chariot One Advance Two to protect the horse, at this time the black side has lost the momentum, the reason is that Pawn Five to Four is to leave the pawn, the result is that the pawn cannot be left, and the opponent's central pawn is still there, which is harmful to oneself and beneficial to the other, which is a taboo of strategists, this is one of the reasons for losing momentum, injuring the central pawn without any cost, but losing the effectiveness of the four advances, this is the second reason for losing momentum, after losing the pawn, if calculated by the number of steps, the black side who moves first only has five steps, while the red side who moves later has as many as nine steps, all of these are called losing the initiative, the black side's Pawn Five to Four changes to the method of moving in the twelfth round, then it will not lose the initiative,</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (101)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two Male Leads, Two Female Leads, and Two Painted Faces Truly Fighting and Cursing Over a Play's Envy</p>
<p>When San Xiaobai performed at Tianchan at the same time in the eighth year of the Republic of China, the roles were very complete. San Xiao refers to Yang Xiaolou, Tan Xiaopei, and Shang Xiaoyun. Yi Bai refers to Bai Mudan, whose current name is Xun Pingsheng. At that time, Xiaoyun's reputation was much higher than Huisheng's, but the two's routes to singing female roles were completely different. Shang was a Zheng Gong Qingyi (serious female role), and Xun was a Hua Dan (vivacious female role) and Dao Ma Dan (female warrior role). At that time, although the term "Four Famous Dan" had not yet been established, the city of Beijing already had four groups of supporters for the roles: Mei (poison), Huang (disease), Shang (party), and Bai (society), which were the same as the popular terms in society. In the past twenty years, one of the four, Huang Runqing, has fallen, and one, Cheng Yanqiu, has emerged, and the one who has filled this vacancy is exactly the second place. The only difference is that Xiaoyun has been reduced to the rear, but Huisheng has climbed to the top of Xiaoyun. Speaking of the reasons for the reversal of Shang and Xun's ranking, it has something to do with this quarrel and Xiaoyun's arrogance. It can be seen that the most important thing for an actor is popularity, and the skill is secondary.</p>
<p>One day, the playbill was "Hong Ni Pass," co-performed by Shang and Xun. Xiaoyun played Dongfang, who was originally the more important role. Later, it is unknown from which famous Dan it originated, but the maid in the second book became the main role, and Dongfang was reduced to a supporting role. Of course, the maid had a large section of Erliu Ban, which was very exciting, but Dongfang's "thinking of spring" scene was also very difficult to perform. Moreover, the person who played this role before had to sing a slow Ban Xi Pi, unlike the simple Yuan Ban that is sung now after being reduced to a supporting role. This time, Huisheng and Xiaoyun sang this play together, and naturally Shang was the main and Xun was the secondary, according to the price and role of the two at the time. However, Huisheng came to the South for the first time at that time, and he also had his uncle Wu Caixia to help him, so naturally he was serious about acting everywhere. Moreover, he was born with fair skin and a handsome appearance. He was originally a Bangzi Hua Dan, so he naturally had a deep understanding of this kind of lascivious clothing. He could really make the audience under the stage lose their minds, so the applause continued one after another without interruption. When Xiaoyun's maid appeared, she simply did not receive any good response. Xiaoyun was originally a proud temper who called himself Shang Wangye (it is said that his superior was some kind of hereditary prince among the Manchus). Today, he was going to play the main role, but before the main role appeared, the thunderous applause kept ringing. When he came out, it was silent. How could he endure it? So he scolded Huisheng at that time, making Xun Huisheng utterly confused.</p>
