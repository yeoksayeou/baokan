<p>（華盛頓）　美國國務院昨日對於日本爲修改上海公共租界地皮章程所爲要求、已正式予以拒絕、美方牒文乃由美大使格魯送達東京、共行文中稱此一問題、當局勢未入於安定狀態時、尙不能予以考慮、該牒文又云、美國相信、常此日本軍事侵華而產生之變態情勢時期中、美國與日本間、關於上海公共租界問題、當不能有滿意之解決也、美國牒文、不僅警告日本、不應利用此一多事之秋、危害影響國際性質之上海公共租界、並喚起日本、應將蘇州河以北之租界區域、交還上海工部局當局、該牒文稱「關於上海地皮章程之任何必需的修改、美國應一如過往、準備作友好的及有系統的正式談判、然美國又不能不指出者、卽美國認爲上海情形、目前距常態甚遠、故根本缺乏對於各種複雜問題、在各有關方面、作極公平解決討論之某礎、」該牒文繼云、公共租界當局、曾努力完成共平時之任務、但因日本軍事當局拒絕將蘇州河以北區域交還租界當局及與公共租界隣近區域內之不法活動、使租界當局對其職務進行、甚感棘手、「美國又勸請日本考慮、日本政府若坦然承認租界當局之優良工作、並將蘇州河以北租界區域之管轄全權、交還租界當局、則公共租界行政機構之工作效率、常可增進矣、總之、美國之觀察、上海租界之發展、多賴各國僑民爲大衆利益而竭力從事所成、在此發展中、公共租界亦處於一極重要之地位、故凡足以影饗租界之現狀及福利者、亦可影饗多數國家、美國當亦包括在內、關於修改地皮章程、美國相信、尙須等待一般情形、在較安定之發展時、始能言及也、」又權威方面透露消息、關於日本要求在上海公共租界獲得較大之治權事、國務卿赫爾、曾時與格魯及美國駐滬總領事高斯、互通消息、據云、此一牒文送達東京以前、美國曾與其他有關國家保持接觸、預料英國對日本要求之答覆將與美方牒文、在實質上完全相同、該答覆中行將指稱、因日本以軍事侵華所產生之變態情勢、而欲修改上海地皮章程、目前並非其時、（十八日美聯社電）</p>
<p>美國務卿爾氏</p>
<p>（香港）　據今日日人方面厦門消息、鼓浪嶼之日軍、大部份業已在英美海軍登陸之前數小時退去、目前留駐公共租界者、僅爲一小部分、至於鼓浪嶼之中外居民、因英美軍隊業已登陸、人心大定、再則即留駐公共租界之日軍少數部隊、亦已逐漸撒至日人所辦醫院方面集中、聞英美兩國海軍陸戰隊之在鼓浪嶼登岸者、人數皆與日本留駐鼓浪嶼之部隊相等、英美海軍陸戰隊登陸之時間、爲昨日下午六時、法國巡艦「巴丁」號較後抵鼓、但亦於午夜派兵登陸、觀察家認、英美法三國海軍此項迅速之行動、已使鼓浪嶼之地位、轉危爲安、此事大足影響日人對於上海公共租界此後之行動也、（十八日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美政府頃已照會日政府、對於日本此時欲修正上海公共租界地皮章程與變更公共租界內中國法院地位之要求、槪予拒絕、並請日本將日軍所佔上海蘇州河以北地方之管理權、交還公共租界當局、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>外國軍艦集中鼓嶼</p>
<p>鼓浪嶼　上星期五日在此登岸之二百名日本水兵、其多數已於夜間撤退今晨僅有四十二名日兵仍留於此、昨晚六時英美法水兵亦各有四十二人在此登陸、其數各與目前留此之日兵相等、在英美法水兵登陸以前、駐華英艦隊司令諾白爾、向日人提出類似哀的美敦之警告、如登陸日兵不卽全數撤退、則英兵等亦將登岸、並聲明決不能有不遵照土地章程遽行修改鼓浪嶼工部局組織之問題云、昨日又有驅逐艦兩艘駛抵鼓浪嶼海上、計在此者、有巡艦一、驅逐艦三、美國巡艦與驅逐艦各一、法國巡艦一、國際軍艦現集中於此（十八日路透社電）字林報云、昨（十七日）悉、星期二日晨乘英巡洋艦白明罕號行抵鼓浪嶼之英國駐華艦隊總司令諾白爾海軍大將、將無限期留駐該地、以觀發展、諾氏原定明日（十九日）抵滬、頃聞渠於若干時日內不能來埠、同時、原定於白明罕號抵此前不久、卽將離滬之英巡艦陶賽夏號、仍將留泊本埠、待總司令離鼓浪嶼來滬時、始啟椗駛出、另訊、諾白爾大將留鼓兩日、卽自厦乘艦來滬、</p>
<p>美遠東政策轉積極</p>
<p>（紐約）　據此間各報載稱、關於日本所提增加上海公共租界工部局日本代表人數之要求、美國政府已經嚴峻拒絕、拒絕覆文、係由駐日大使格魯、昨日送達日本政府、各報今晨評論此項牒文時、提及英美海軍在厦門登陸一事、認爲係美國「積極遠東政策」之第一步、同時顯示英美兩國、爲維護遠東之共同利益起見、已經採取聯合行動、（十八日海通社電）</p>
<p>東京方面表示驚異</p>
<p>（東京）　今日外交部官員拒絕預測日軍對公共租界事件之下一舉動、同時日海軍發言人對昨日英美法海軍突在鼓浪嶼登陸一節表示驚異、日外務省雖拒絕發表將來之日軍行動、但美國反對日本所提出之修改上海公共租界地皮章程之要求、勢將發生以下結果、（一）此後日方於派遣軍隊至中國其他外國租界以前將先猶豫、不敢再斷然處置矣、（二）與歐洲全能國家締結軍事協定之事、又將舊事重提、（三）日方又將重控西方列强不能了解日本在華之目的、又今日日外决告英駐日大使克萊琪稱、日軍之在鼓浪嶼登陸僅係緊急措置、其目的乃在保護該處之日僑、又日外决於提交日方對英國提議之答覆予英駐日大使、向克氏保證稱、日軍在鼓浪嶼之登陸、僅係欲保護日僑、日海軍卽將絡續撤退、此間日海軍發言人宣稱、彼對美英法海軍突在鼓浪嶼登陸一節、表示驚異、蓋以去年日軍亦曾在該處登陸、而英法美三國並未提出任何抗議也、彼並謂、彼對英美法三國海軍之突然登陸、實不解彼等之用意何在、因此舉實「並非必要」也、彼復指出、去年五月二十二日至七月三十一日、日海軍亦曾在鼓浪嶼登陸、但外國領事並未曾提出任何抗議也、彼堅持日軍目下之行動、實係因恐怖行動之故、彼末謂、彼以爲日軍之在鼓島登陸、與日方要求修改上海地皮章程及改組上海工部局二點、並無任何關係、（十八日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　海軍發言人金澤、今日答復關於鼓浪嶼事件之種種問話、承認在陸戰隊登陸以前、鼓浪嶼日人未被攻擊而日人產業亦未被毀壞、但謂日本海軍當局認陸戰隊之登陸、爲必要的緊急自衛計畫、惟渠未見時局有英美方面採此同樣行動之必要、渠不解日本在鼓浪嶼之行爲、何以引起海外如此張皇之反饗云、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日外務省已於昨夜以答復英國抗議日軍在鼓浪嶼登陸事之文、送交英大使館、復文內容、尙未公布、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>華人發生良好印象</p>
<p>（重慶）　列强對於鼓浪嶼事而採之堅强態度、已使此間華人各界發生甚好印象、此爲（一）列强旣不受日本之虛聲恫嚇、此後對日交涉、將採視前更爲有力之步驟、（二）列强旣採堅强立塲、日本定將退縮、重慶聯合日報今晨社論、謂日本現逐步侵佔外人在華之權利、日本之目的在完全剗除外人在華權利、顯然可見、列强欲保障其利益、非用有力計畫不可、如妥洽與讓步、則徒鼓勵日本得步進步而已、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>美國務院發表公報</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　國務院頃於本日發表公報、說明中國鼓浪嶼現行局勢、略謂、（一）英美兩國駐華海軍當局、已於本日午後六時（當地時間）決定分別遣派海軍陸戰隊一小隊在該處登陸、用以保護租界、（二）美國巡洋艦「瑪勃爾海特」號、驅逐艦「蒲爾梅」號、英國巡洋艦「伯明罕」號、曁驅逐艦三艘、均在厦門寄椗、（三）日本海軍陸戰隊前於本月十一日登陸者、原有一百五十名、現已减至四十二名、（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　據國務院昨晚宣稱、美國海軍、恐日人企圖佔據公共租界引起紛擾、故於昨日在鼓浪嶼登陸、保護美人生命財產、登陸美軍、爲數不大、美艦「大理石」號及「蒲爾梅」號現均停泊於厦門、（十八日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　路透社聞諸英海軍部駐鼓浪嶼之英法美軍艦、皆已各派陸戰隊四十二人在厦門公共租界之鼓浪嶼登陸、其總數與登陸日軍人數相等、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>赫爾向各記者談話</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　關於日本向上海公共租界工部局提出耍求事、赫爾國務卿頃向各報記者發表談話稱、日方要求、內容如何、恕難奉告、國務院刻正加以研究、當在短時期內提出覆文、此其性質、對於上海厦門（卽鼓浪嶼）兩處公共租界、均適用之云、此外、據此間負責人士宣稱、國務院刻正徵詢駐日大使格魯曁上海總領事高斯意見、以便參酌情形、起草覆文、同時並與其他各關係國政府保持聯絡、（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美國務赫爾今日聲稱、關於上海公共租界事、渠現準備致牒日本以答復其加增工部局日人議董之請求云、此牒內容現無表示、惟據消息靈通者云、美國刻正與英法接洽此事、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>字林報評鼓浪嶼案</p>
<p>自鼓浪嶼案發生後、本埠各西報皆載社評、抨擊日人之行動、雖穩健如字林報者、亦力持正論、日前載短評、題曰、「鼓浪嶼之反映」、已譯誌昨日本報、該報昨又載社評、題曰「鼓浪嶼案」、特再迻譯如次、</p>
<p>本文屬稿之時、所得之消息、未有表明鼓浪嶼之局勢已稍進步者，蓋日方已派武裝軍隊在該島登陸、該島公共租界實際已處於日本軍事統轄之下、且更提出要求五項、而使日人完全統制該島之市政、就日方五月十四日向鼓浪嶼工部局提出之要求觀之、確由日人處心積慮而出此、鼓浪嶼工部局所予日方之答覆、聞爲日人所不能接受、工部局之覆文、質言之、乃聲明按照公共租界依以組成之地皮章程、不能徇從日方之要求、而予以變更、就該案一切事實而綸、此爲工部局所能依公道採取之唯一可能的態度、固甚明瞭也、日方之要求、若經完全承認、則爲等於將公共租界所被賦予之權利與特殊利益讓交日方、及將國際性質之行政轉爲日人一方之行政、蓋工部局其他外董之名額、雖顯無更動、而工部局之決議將由服務事政之日員實行之一</p>

<h3 id="c2">上海之法治 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>昨日一日之中，上海報紙之受嚴厲處分者四；所以處分之者：不同其主體，不同其方式。不同其重輕，抑且不同其所稱之理由；所同者，皆英美商營而活氣充溢之華文報紙也。如此大舉，在任何國家，惟於國體政體政權發生劇變時偶見之；在蕞爾上海，則無此先例；故非依據常識常情所可加以論衡。况此四報之事，一方面以其爲正式公務機關所作之處分。故必視之爲法權之發動。又一方面，無論其爲政治性質、或爲行政性質，或爲警察性質，其性質可以不拘一格；無論其是合法，或是非法，或屬職權範圍，或竟踰越職權，或允當，或過或不及。其是非雖必有準則，顧亦未可執一而論；蓋不問處分之性質如何，處分之是非如何，凡事之業已成爲法權案件者。則在法權發動之後，法權管轄之內，依法解決之前，皆未許以私人之見解，主觀之情感，擅事論衡。此乃現代法治精神與言論自由之領域所在，不容出入，。念彼四報，吾人所極苦悶而幾至於窒息者也。</p>
<p>吾人尊重法治精神，不克於四報成爲法權案件時，爲案件之內容而有所主張；然吾不能不更爲法治而大聲疾呼。在兩閱月之前，上海有若于恐怖之現象，當局惶惶，圖謀應付：吾人嘗鑒於「誰願毀上海上竊以爲莫願毀之；誰能毀上海，竊以爲莫不能毀之」，故主張「建立適合實際之嚴明方法」，期望「各方相忍遵循嚴明之軌道」。六日之前，五口人嘗謂欲求上海安定，「斯應各守其分，而以確認一切法理上之地位爲先；理論有見仁見智之殊，惟以守法爲合理，惟能守法始克保持常態」；又謂「枉法亂法，同是毀法，法毀則無所守，於是各以暢所欲行爲快意，而終於共趨毀滅；如此毀滅實是內潰，未可歸咎於大環境。」凡此所云。皆出於法治之信念；深信於治上海者。惟法而已。</p>
<p>爲上海論法治，初非以上海當局旣有枉法亂法之作爲。祗以上海之遭遇，似乎使人懷疑於墨守成法之不足以適應環境；而於無可奈何之中，又似一切依法主張，近於不顧現實之高調；乃惟有以所謂諒解與合作，薪求法外之辦法。此種苦心孤詣，誠爲達者所共諒；然其所獲之後果，將爲差勝乎？抑將爲更惡乎？此在信仰法治者，必有其正常而明確之答案；所不易答者。乃爲如何應付朝不保夕之目前？如何避免直接行動之紛擾與危機？蓋眞理與事實之所以參商，有其病因，即上海之根本正在搖撼之中。惟以根本搖撼，不免信念徬徨，其實，根本竟至於搖撼而顚覆，誠非法治所得挽救；皮之不存，毛將安傅，是無所謂法，亦無所謂治；若乃毀法求治，何殊緣木求魚；而對於法治信念之徬徨，且將加重根本之搖撼；此又眞理而必符事實者也。</p>
<p>及至今日，關於上海之根本問題者，旣由英美兩國同時發爲嚴明之表示；主張有關上海之一切，務以地皮章程爲依歸：地皮章程乃國際條的，根據條的即國際之法治也。此種主張，必以其最合理而得貫澈；而上海根本之搖撼，必因此而歸於安定。根本安定，則不但內部允應尊重法治，抑且愈有厲行法治之可能。於是吾人有願爲上海租界當局告者：至今日爲止，租界內之一切措施。無論其爲界內之各國居民所信任，所感戴，或所懷疑，所怨懟，顧尙未聞合法非法之爭議；是以自今日而推進法治，發揮法治精神，猶是輕而易舉。要在當局處處示人以尊重法治，以身作則，則必任何人對於當局不敢輕作法外之求。而所以表示尊重法治者，要在將每一措施，剴切示人以法權之根據；務使人人了然於措施之合法，而樂於接受法治。即如四報之事，在上海爲空前，亦即有說明之必要者也。</p>

<p>（重慶特訊）中國僑民教育、在民十七以前、由僑委會華僑教委會辦理、嗣因該會停頓、由前大學院主持其事、以海外各地、無直接主管各本地僑民教育行政者、因訂定領事經理華僑教育行政規　、十八年、由教部將僑民教育行政分由普通教育司主辦、另設華僑教育設計委會、辦理設計及建議事項、迨僑委會改組設置僑民教育處后、僑民教育行政、乃由僑委會主持、教部又居於會核地位、華僑設計委會、即無形停頓、領事經理、亦未達到預期效能、迄今僑民教育行政機構、尙未能切實調整、今后應特加注意、茲將歷來僑教概况、的述於下、</p>
<p>一般法制</p>
<p>十九年、教部訂定華僑中小學規程、將僑校經費、設備。課程訓育·校董會·教職員·學生·研究會等、一一加以規定、以爲辦理僑校之準繩、此外復公布華僑中小學校董會組織規程、華僑學校立案規程、華僑子弟回國就學辦法、重要法制、大致完備、僑委會改組后、將所有規程、由雙方會商一一加以修正、除改華僑爲僑民、及冠以修正二字外、內容多仍舊貫並無重大變更</p>
<p>辦理立案</p>
<p>僑民學校之向政府立案者、十年以來、年有增加、現時計中學四十八所、小學三百六十所、僑校的有二千四百餘校、立案者不及十分之二、所以致此者、一因各國殖民地政府之阻撓、一因各地僑民教育行政實際乏人就近督導、故向中央立案者、不甚踴躍、</p>
<p>經費補助</p>
<p>僑委會改組后、由中央年撥二十萬元、作爲僑民教育之補助費、凡立案僑校經費不足、及僑民子弟回國就學而家境貧寒成績優良者、均分別予以補助、每支配補助費時、由僑委會召集會議、教部派員參加者、現此項經費、仍七折發放、</p>
<p>派員視察</p>
<p>二十五年、僑委會及教部曾會同派員往南洋各埠視察僑民教育、曾至英屬美屬各地、結果尙稱圓滿、此外如辦理僑校師資訓練班、籌備華僑教育總會等、事項尙多、均由僑委會積極進行、</p>

<p>沈光烈君在上海市中學</p>
<p>生升學就業指導班講詞</p>
<p>四格謀業途徑</p>
<p>我們方出校門、究竟從什麼地方去找訓職業呢、一閉門家裹坐」、當然不會「職業天上來」、除非是有人代謀的吾則必須有賴於活動、謀業的途　大槪有四、</p>
<p>一、公共機關登記在上海公開登記的地方有三處、一是中華職業教育社附設的上海職業指導所、二是靑年會介紹部、三是寰球中國學生會介紹部、在內地本來有全國學術工作諮詢處主辦、現在教育部也有專門辦理此項食物的設置、不過限於專門人才，這種地方都是為社會服務而不取費用的、其手續及所應汪意處提示如次、（一）塡表、塡表是職業登記必要的手繼、從此可以考察擬的履歷及狀況、以便作介紹的根據、當塡表時千萬要注意細到，不可草率、因為這是給人第一個印象、好壞大有關係、通信處如有變更、尤須隨時通知、免失效力、（二）談話、談話時應表示自己的特長、或近於某方面、如數理、文學。會計。打字等。切不可含糊地說什麽事都好、因為用人者必有所需、最難安置者、便是這種人、（三）詢問、隔了相當時期、應加詢問有無機會、因登記人者必有所需、最難安置者、便是這種人、　詢問、隔了相當記者會介紹時切勿猶豫或計及待遇之多寡、應包嘗試態度、前往接洽、</p>
<p>二、親友介紹親友介紹之方式有二、（一）通信、通信應注意到字跡之工整、言辭之簡當、不必長篇累牘、絮絮不休、信後通信處、應每封信都附上、而且要寫得詳細、以便對方作覆時的檢閱（二）面洽、注意到自身服裝的整潔、態度應不亢不卑、抱定求業、爲正當的活動、更不可存怕羞的心理、要注意到對方的需要、自己能貢獻的是什麼、在談話到了相當段落時、應立即起身告辭、（三）續詢、隔了相當時候、應加探詢、探詢的方式、不可呆板、老是談到職業問題、應隨時變換、如人事、時事、新聞等、免生嚴鄂、</p>
<p>三、推向探求　馮個人觀察或親友傳聞、在某種塲合、或有某種需要、不妨設法前往探求、報紙上微求聘請等廣告、雖不是處處可靠、但也不妨應微、以增進閱歷、成功固然可喜、失敗也沒有什麽關係、多决嘗試、總有成功的一天、</p>
<p>四　自創自創的意思、就是自已經營或合夥經營某一種職業來維持生活、如開一小店經營商業、就是一例、此外最好免除虛榮、打破階級觀念、所謂脫下長杉來幹、較有辦法、記得曾任某縣督學的某君、在一個酒家賣粽子、牛涯很盛、又有一偶擦皮鞋的靑年、每月倒也有四十餘元的收入、除了生活開支外、更可寄若干家用、業餘尙在進修、實可敬佩、這都是親睹目見的實列、</p>
<p>得業後當努力</p>
<p>得業以後、對於自己的物質報酬、應當知足、常想到無業時的苦、及一般境遇不如我的人尙多、應當心平氣和、倘能努力工作、自可得上級信人、增加報酬、業餘如能得入補習學校學習、實際知識最好、萬一環境不允許、亦宜努力自修性之所近之學科、對於業務經騐、更當重視、不可疏忽、</p>
<p>無工作應忍耐</p>
<p>如果一時無相當工作、亦不必灰心、須知天下不如意事、十常占八九、只要你有心上進、機會總不曾辜負的、正如長途行船一樣、如何能保得住天天順風呢、衝過逆境、順境自來、終於能達到目的地、困難愈多、離成功之境也愈近、以往不乏先例、隨處可得、希望珍重努力、至於就業的原理原則、因限於時間、容以後有機會時再談、</p>

<p>未得答覆</p>
<p>函中又稱、傅於三月二十八日已致函租界當局、喚起對此事之注意、但尙未接得答覆、三月二十三日、曾與工部局總裁費信惇會談、費氏允對西區界外馬路問題、加以誠意的考慮、但迄未有所行動、傅氏昨日之函中、乃請費氏對此等事件、與彼互通音訊、末稱、今上海區中　有「特別市府」、希望工部局與領事團「爲公共租界之和平與秩序、以及人民之福利起見」、與該「市府」合作云、</p>

<p>鮮猪業及鮮肉業被迫停業以來、迄今多日、立塲堅定、靜候租界當局爲之善後、在此期內續到之貨、雖爲數有限、因鮮猪係屬活貨、不能躭擱時間、一般販客、紛向各行要求設法救濟、以維血本、至於兩租界內之存活猪、昨據調查所得、南市場的一千四百餘頭、北市塲的六百餘頭、總的二千餘頭、但兩租界平時每日所需之猪、的二千餘頭、</p>
<p>租界當局勸導複業</p>
<p>法租界工部因查得界內特於昨晨邀集鮮豬業公會代表，及各豬行經歷竭力勸道各行、務於十九日先將存猪秤售、以維民食、否則如有存豬不賣、有違公董局維持民食之意旨。同時公共租界工部局、於昨日下午三時、召開局務會議時、衛生處長提出關於猪業停市之報告、經考慮研究後、亦勸導先行復業、以維民食、</p>
<p>鮮猪業昨議決複業</p>
<p>鮮猪業同業公會於昨日下午四時、召集全市各猪行會議、轉達租界當局勸導維持民食之意、各行經理表示仍守原來立塲、但爲尊重租界當局一再勸導之意、勉於十九日起、先儘存猪秤售、並即通知鮮肉業、共同尊重租界當局勸導之意、聞各鮮猪行今日起即行復業、惟依目前情形而言、兩租界內之存猪、僅供給一天之銷售、</p>
<p>恢復宰豬明晨有肉</p>
<p>法租界工部局之宰牲處、及公共租界蘇錫宰牲公司、新寗海宰牲公司、均定今日起開始恢復宰猪、所以全市二千餘家之鮮肉店肉攤、須至二十日（即明晨）起、方有鮮肉出售、關於鮮肉市價、連日因停市關係飛漲、每一市斤巳漲至八角以上、預料鮮猪業復業之後、鮮肉價格即可恢復原狀、惟因到貨爲數有限、肉業前途、殊難樂觀、</p>
<p>兩宰牲處曾遭壓迫</p>
<p>公共租界北成都路一〇五〇弄五〇號之蘇錫宰牲公司、北成都路一〇五〇弄四號之新寗海宰牲公司、於本月十三日晨、停市宰猪後、詎於十六日晚、有日人數名、突赴兩宰牲公司强迫宰猪、當經全體工人、嚴詞拒絕迨後成都路捕房派捕馳往勸告後、該兩宰牲公司爲遵從常局之美意、勉强開宰、又據關係方面傳出、昨日中午十二時、宰牲公司發現有尙未爆發之手溜彈一枚、置於公司前電桿木傍之地、經報告捕房後携去研究、究竟是吾爲恐嚇宰牲公司、尙難斷定、</p>

<p>昨晨、米業市塲因現貨籌碼缺乏、供不應求、市價驟然飛漲、最高價竟開十七元七角、市塲被迫、提早停市、並開會勸導貨主、登記將展延截止、米號業昨日開會商討應付辦法、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>昨晨米價　又吿飛漲</p>
<p>滬米業市塲之交易、經勸告同業遵守限價、從嚴取締暗盤、獎勵檢舉後、連日米價稍呈回鬆局勢、市塲亦頗稱穩定、詎昨晨開市後、買方多而賣方少、致市價又趨飛漲、最高價竟達十七元七角、照原限價十五元計算、巳超越百分之二十弱、查其結果、飛漲原因、仍不外囤戶操縱居奇、致市塲現貨交易、籌碼缺乏、求過於供、數日中內地來源、雖有增加、惟去胃激增、難以濟事、但存棧米糧甚少、在市塲拋出等所致、</p>
<p>市場被迫提早收市</p>
<p>市場管理委員會、鑒於交易情勢激變、暗盤之風、雖經嚴厲監視、但賣買雙方、均保守默契、故無從着手、市塲上祇見喊進、而未見拋出、人聲囂嘵、情形至爲紊亂、市塲無法應付、被迫提早於十一時許停市、旋即召集各行客帮進行勸告、但仍毫無效果、</p>
<p>存米登記展期截止</p>
<p>米業評價委員會、自於本年十二日開始辦理存米貨主登記、定期一週、原定於昨日下午五時、即行截止、惟各存米貨主、前往塡表登記者、雖不乏其人、然極爲稀少、的計一週來登記米糧數値六萬一千餘包、大米貨主、皆抱觀望態度、惟至昨午截止、各行號臨時領取表格、反見踴躍、故登記期暫爲展延一二日、聞米業評價委員會方面、俟結東後、決將據情陳報兩租界當局處置、</p>
<p>米號集議查示囤戶</p>
<p>上海市米號業公會自接得上海市商會函復爲評查囤戶姓名、以便商請租界當局、設法勸導、及豆米行業公會盼各米號共守限價、及希望舉發告密後、特於昨日下午五時、至該會會所召開第二十决常委會議、討論（一）如何勸導同業勿放價購進、共守限價、以便平定米價、（二）查示囤戶姓名、急不容緩、應如何進行等各要案多件、</p>
<p>米號會員訴呈苦衷</p>
<p>米號業同員南昌米號等、因對於米號門售、厲行限價、頗有種種困難、故特於昨日致函上海市豆米行業同業公會略云、查敝業係與食戶直接接觸之銷貨者、必有貨而後可以應市、決不能以今日之所需者、今日購進、明日所需者、明日購進、此衆所共知之事實也、况米品繁多、主顧取舍無定、多備者或去路有限、少備者適銷路甚廣、任何米號、亦決不能旬日而不謀添補者、此亦貴會所熟知者也、現今米市囤戶、競相放價、暢辦之下、逾限已及半月、而欲敝業各號懍於遵守、應市限價而粒合不購、此非事理之所能、而亦事實之所不可能者、（下略）</p>

<h3 id="c98">鰣魚 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 陳家楨</p>
<p>據李氏本草綱目載：「鰣魚又名爲瘟魚。」其說何自，迄無可考，而世人之呼爲鰣魚者，因其獨見於初夏，故於魚旁附一時字，所以標此魚之知時焉。按鰣魚性質甘平無毒。其成分雖未經化騐，而其入口而肥，則其中含多量脂肪？亦可知矣。夫魚肉本多燐質蛋白質，鰣魚豈能例外？或言鰣魚之成分與鱉魚肝油頗相類似，惟尚乏確證耳。時至今日，啖鰣魚者多矣，類多涎其味而忽其用，茹其肉而棄其鱗，誠可惜耳！</p>
<p>鰣魚之肉，通常均用爲助餐下酒之物，而不知其在醫療上之功效亦殊偉大，且可外用。茲略述如决：</p>
<p>（一）內服爲强壯藥昔孟詵云：「鰣魚可補虛。」張路玉云：「鰣魚性補，溫中，益氣。」近人王吉民亦謂「魚肝油係由鱉魚之肝提出，爲補肺聖藥。中國之鰣魚，亦有同樣之功用。五十年前，僑居寗波之英人麥高雲醫士，曾謂其功可治肺癆云。」</p>
<p>（二）外用治火傷明寗原食鑑本草論鰣魚肉云：「蒸下油以瓶盛埋土中，取塗湯火傷甚效。」</p>
<p>凡剝取鰣魚鱗者，須乘其活時，拔划水邊二鱗，尖長者佳。如取諸死魚者，其力遠遜。按鰣魚鱗之功用，亦有下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）治湯火傷　本經逢源云：「治湯火傷用鰣魚鱗，香油熬塗，立效。」</p>
<p>（二）治血痣蔡雲白云：「人生血痣挑破，血出不止者，用鰣魚鱗貼之，即結痂而愈」</p>
<h3 id="c99">韮菜青菜 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 衲子</p>
<p>晋周顒恬淡寡欲，足不履城；鄉居灌畦，以酒自樂；生平最喜韮與菘，以爲雖山珍海味不能過。嘗曰：「春初早韮，秋末晚菘；食此可消長日矣。」富豪子弟，食必進廣州館，對此家園薛蔬，存輒蔑之心，而周顒酷好之，余不解也。韮性陰濕，故於近水之畦地，最能生長；如有樹蔭之藍蔽則更佳。其味並不高明，江浙人允賤視之，佛家以此爲五葷之一，以余所知，惟湘贛一帶居民最嗜此，鄉民菜畦，必栽韮菜，猶藥中必有甘草也。每當仲春之月，韮葉黃嫩，狀頗美觀。烹而食之，味亦不壞；一月後味較遜，但有新茁之嫩芽可以代之。及夏末，則味同嚼蠟矣。所可喜者，厥爲其巳抽嫩苗，韮苗較韮葉之味爲美，誠一怪事。大凡食物不能獨烹，宜與他物配合，如以韮苗炒冬苟肉絲，思過半矣。韮於肺部略有益處，又鄉人偶有跌打損傷，蜈蚣蛇毒，喜以韮根敷之，據云功能散血。</p>
<p>菘即靑菜，湘人謂之白菜頗費解。菘本寒季蔬菜，但亦有叫季能生長者；故處今日之上海，靑菜並非稀有之物。菘味平常而滋補，西人謂共含有多量之維他命，理有可說，總之，蔬菜淡飯，有益身心，殆無疑義。菘性亦喜濕，故栽菘者必勤液溉；又能傲霜雪，故冬季亦能蓬勃生長，且霜後之菘，味更鮮美。菘苗味更佳，宜與肉片炒食，謂之菜心炒肉片。經冬而後，菘葉枯黃，故鄉人不待共枯萎，即連根拔出，煮熟曬乾，以鹽漬之，謂之鹽菜，鹽菜炒臘肉或湯烹，皆可口。要之，家園蒔蔬，味美價廉，當此時艱，宜節海味而近蔬菜，於國有益於身亦有補也。</p>
<h3 id="c100">陰虛體質食品單（二） <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>（甲）最適宜之滋養食品</p>
<p>（十七）鱉甲湯—鱉甲卽甲魚之外壳，甲魚除燉食外，各藥店尚有『鱉甲』一種出售，實卽爲甲魚之硬壳，價極廉，每兩的洋八分，此爲甲魚中滋陰成分最豐富之物質，每日購五錢，與紅棗數枚煎煮飲湯代茶，能治陰虛潮熱·骨蒸·顴紅及掌心發熱諸恙，陰虛內熱者，常飲亦無妨。</p>
<p>（十八）大蒜—大蒜除有益腸胃外，能益肺病，已爲人所共知，但此物並非能治肺癆之食物，僅爲滋養肺部增加抗癆作用之佐食品，慣食者可以多食，不慣食者每日僅可食一二小囊，且肺病發潮熱或內熱重時食之，反爲無益。又蒜以生食爲佳，醋蒜功效略遜。</p>
<p>（十九）韮菜—亦是益肺之品，其性質功韓，大致與蒜相同，功力較遜。</p>
<p>（二十）芡實·山藥·蓮心—此三種食品，凡有遺精者，可當點心常食之。略有補腎固攝精關之效，但滑精久者，的攝之能力不濟，須藥物治療之。</p>
<p>（二一）苡米—苡米卽米仁，功能補肺淸肺，爲一種效力極大之滋養品，有豐富之蛋白質，此物好到極點，常吃與利濕無關，功大和平，與肺肺疾有益非淺，可以常吃，常入陰虛火旺，自疑易牛肺疾者，可常食苡米，每日煮一盅，功能防癆，切勿輕視。苡米煮時須費四小時許，苡米陳者均有微蛀，此乃無可設法之事，煮時當須揀選一過，惟向有白濁或遺精者須試食之，或有不適宜者。</p>
<p>（二二）藕粉—此物最有益於吐血病者，補血止血，功效極大，補血能力勝於小牛肝之上，婦女血少者亦宜食之，確係人間寶物，但普通價賤藕粉，並非眞貨，往往係菱粉澱粉冒充，水調後亦起白凍狀態，因藕粉眞者，成本極昂，戰前惟有三友實業社之眞藕粉，確是眞貨，吐血患者，食此最易復元。市上南貨店所售白片藕粉，十九贗質，大好食品，一時無法購得，深爲憾事。</p>
<p>（二三）血湯—普通鷄血湯，滋陰補血之能力極大，猪血湯亦有同樣價值，以前歐美人土，以爲食血爲野蠻人種食法，近世臟器療法發明之後，已確知血湯有補血養血之效，此卽國醫所謂「以血補血」之理也。鷄血猪血如與鷄湯或菠菜同煮，更收相得益彰之效。</p>
<p>（二四）烏賊—稍有滋陰能力，尚非無益之品。</p>
<p>（二五）鷄蛋—養生之功效久著，無庸贅述。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c101">吃冷飯 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 任立德</p>
<p>有許多人到了熱大，往往喜歡吃冷飯，他們在早晨，就把三餐的飯在一决燒好；以後，中膳晚飯都吃早上燒好的冷飯，從表面上看來，似乎這是一件很節的的事，非但味道很爽口，而且又省時間。</p>
<p>可是，我們要知道，冷飯吃下去是會停積許多時候；需要胃部發生熱力作用，才能鼓動消化，而且飯到了冷時，水分蒸發將盡，米粒均呈粳性，又需要許多胃液去浸潤，這會給全部的消化作用發生很大的阻礙。由於上述兩個原因，多吃冷飯時常會成胃病，那不是貪小失大嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c102">嬰孩斷乳之後 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 幼</p>
<p>斷乳，乃是兒童一個最重要的關鍵，在斷乳時期的兒童無論在看護上，飲食上，必然會發生很大的困難。這種困難產生的原因，一牛是因爲兒童的陡然變更環境；一半是兒童的動作，習慣的進步。哺乳時期的結束，就是兒童進入另一種生活的開始，換言之，就是逐漸成人，而以成人服用的食物以代乳汁。倘若兒童對於吸乳習慣的消滅感到不自然，那末，爲看護者就得敎導兒童從杯碗中取液體或固體食物的方法，必須不厭求詳，待到進種習慣養成時，吸乳的習慣也就無形地消滅了。</p>
<p>形式問題可依此法解決，可是關於食物的本質及其營養的成分呢？斷乳以後的飲食，除了氣味與形體耍適當的符合兒童的個性外，固體食物的性質也是不可忽略的，因爲堅硬或靱性的食物，非但不易消化，又會擦傷兒童腸胃，最好初時吃薄粥，加入新鮮牛肉汁或童鷄汁，可使小孩一月後即致肥胖，一月後則兼食含織維的蔬菜，例如：靑菜，菠菜，芹菜，萵苣，莧菜等最爲相宜。切細做成湯和薄粥，或者做成烘餅（和以麵粉），牛生熟的鷄蛋，鮮牛奶，猪肉蒸湯，橘子汁，山芋和煮爛的豆類，在量的配置方面，須適兒童的食量，寗可少吃多餐，切勿使之過飽。此外，還得時常舉行日光空氣浴。</p>
<h3 id="c103">何謂「雜症」？ <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 張汝偉</p>
<p>俗稱「火病」</p>
<p>飲食不節，或情懷抑鬱，往往消化不良，得食卽脹，甚至嘔吐；此乃胃酸過多也。久之易成反胃噎膈等症。惟所謂　雜之症，則適與上述相反。稍飢腹卽作痛，得食始止，移時又作，日甚一日，馴至面黃肌瘦，精神疲乏，不能動作。按單純的　雜症，多發生於工作繁忙之人，因飲食不能定時，已飢而不能食，已飽而不知止；或生冷不忌；或食畢卽行劇烈工作所致。每於中午十一時，下午五時，午餐夜餐之前，始覺劇痛。迨飯畢，而其痛若失。考其病由，乃因胃中有火，故痛；胃氣虛弱，故欲藉食物以資抵抗；因食物被火消爍，不得營養之益，故雖能食，而仍面黃肌瘦，精神疲憊也。治療之法，宜用小建中湯去桂枝，加川述一二分，山梔仁二三錢，以和肝胃，合甘麥大棗，健脾緩中；並將煨山藥拌猪油白糖，作點心服食，不久必可霍然矣。</p>

<p>咋日現金烚赤暗盤市况驟起激烈反動、竟接連破入二千一百四十元至三十元二層關口、蓋因當日報載英美法對於鼓浪嶼事件、似能取一致堅決立塲、且登陸日軍已有大部份撤退、情勢逐漸緩和、市上曾一度所傳之種種流言、遂告消逝、又聞兩租界之中外銀行、對於「華與銀行」所發紙幣仍予拒絕承受、故斷難動搖中國整個之金融機構、是以人心轉疲、銀樓帮與現金號等競相猛塞、更有上日所進之某錢兌業亦來斬結、時雖某金號復代投機商加碼吸購、無如終感賣方聲勢占盛、市價直向下瀉、以當日最低價二千一百二十七元收盤、結果回跌十七元、交易依然平平、祇做開六百兩光景、銀樓飾金亦回小一元、海關金與中英純金等仍呆定無變、</p>

<p>自晨每條十兩、初開人心即疲、首喊賣價爲二千一百叫十元、時買方多審愼觀望、致又逐漸喊低、首由銀樓帮賣予某金號五十兩、二千一百三十五元爲開盤價、較之前收做低九元、開後某金號又吸進同業五十兩、價與晨開相同、繼之現金號亦賣予某金號五十兩、價三十四元、時某金號進意轉淡、續向下挫、錢兌業互做五十兩、價三十一元、繼而銀樓帮與現金號相繼賣予某金號各五十兩、價亦三十一元、後賣氣更盛、立刻破人三十元關內、錢兌業吐予某金號共百兩、價竟被撳低三元、而至二十八元、不久錢兌業相同價亦互做五十兩、此後賣風稍戢、瞬即回高二元、錢兌業進現金號五十兩、價卅元、後某金號進錢兌業五十兩、二十九元爲午市收價、午後交易突稀、情勢初時尚平、首由金號賣予錢兌業五十兩、價二十九元、此後沉靜殊久、三二時半許叉見錢兌業賣予某金號五十兩、價二十七元、市勢帶疲、此後叉轉淸靜、晚收仍爲二千一百二十七元、結果較之隔昨晚收軋跌十七元、全天八元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百三十五元、收進二千一百二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>

<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>凡人要成功一些大小事業，少不得總要有一些本事。這本事，說起來就是所謂經濟之才，幹才，自修身齊家，以至於治國平天下，都少不了牠。</p>
<p>在這本事之中，却又可以分成兩種：一種是走着官塘大路，一板三眼，規規矩矩踱方步的，所謂王道者是；一種是只問目的，不擇手段，任何槍花都掉得出來，所謂覇道者是。照理，王道是歷來古聖先王所稱頌，所力行，果然應該無施不可，水到渠成的，可是不幸得很，照我看來，這種王道，從古以來就沒有實行過，或者說，實行了就沒有成功過，我們去翻翻歷史，只看見一派覇道。</p>
<p>每一代的「高祖」「太祖」，創業登基，那一個不是從一刀一槍中打出來，或者從謀王篡位中抓得來的？這不是覇道是什麼？等到一做南面王，果然可以實行仁政，推行王道了，然而我們推究他們，以及他們子孫的心理，又那裏個僩是在愛國愛民呢？又那一個不是要想保全他們那一份私產江山，所以才不得不借古聖先王的大帽子，來壓他們的老百姓，叉假借甚麼聖經賢傳，來提倡那種君要臣死，不得不死的大道理，使老百姓動彈不得？甚麼崇信佑文，甚麼興學施敎，無非愚民政策，呌老百姓好好擁護他們，不要暴動，其作用正與焚書坑儒相等。這那裏是甚麼王道？還不仍是覇道！馬上得之是覇道；不能馬上治之，勉强來馬下治之，到底是覇道。</p>
<p>天下國家還是只有覇道，那就無怪乎社會家庭間，也只有覇道了。換言之，在這些地方，用不着講究甚麼正當的經濟之才，幹才，只要講究些用手段。因爲手段本來有兩路，正是覇道的兩面：</p>
<p>一曰辣。操有生殺之權，對於反抗的，不貸。有地皮可刮，狠狠地刮去幾寸。向我乞憐的，揮之大門之外；向我求告的，一毛不拔。最好使人吃了你的苦，口裏說不出，或者使人望見你的影子都怕，不得不遠遠地避開你，讓你　衝直撞，獨往獨來。……凡此，都是手段之辣，足以助成事業者。</p>
<p>實在也難　手段不能不辣：你想，高尚的「文章」，還須「辣手」才能「著」得出來，而大恩不報，殺以滅口，也是古今來的常事，更何况一般的事情！那又安得而不辣！</p>
<p>一曰詐。自來兵不厭詐，而兵又正是國家大事，是故，詐的勢力，也瀰漫於一切「事」裏「業」間。若不是諸葛亮的七擒七縱，運用詐的長處，那又　得「南人不復反矣」？我常常聽見老輩告誡子弟，「逢人只說三分話」，可以作爲詐的心傳。</p>
<p>原來在複雜的社會中，也許可以說，在文明的人羣裏，老實人，一本正經者，無往而不負有「壽頭」之名，弄得一敗塗地，倒是手段高强，槍花會使得人眼花撩亂者，却如向陽花木，到處逢春。於是辦事的方法，最好者是紮了圈套由人自願鑽入或跌入，如你之願，切不可老實對人說，我所求於他的，不過是某種某種目的，懇請他的帮忙。</p>
<p>一個人的手段，善於辣的，可以成功，善於詐的，允可以成功。假使辣與詐兼善，那就天下去得，無往不利了。</p>
<p>我自己想想，究竟不是偏激之說：講王道的孔子，他的一生是甚麼呢？甚至講覇道，近於王道的覇道的孟子，他的一生又是甚麼呢？而劉邦，趙匡胤，朱元璋之流，又那一個是讀孔孟之書的？再說，講天道的耶穌，他的結果是甚麼呢？而希特勒墨索里尼之徒，叉那一個是員正熱心的基督徒？所以我說，王道，本來就沒有這麼一會事；人以覇道來，我以覇道去，至少在現在，才是眞正的天經地義！</p>
<p>「天下本無事，庸人自擾之」，這是講覇道，用辣與詐的手段的關係。無奈天下個個都是庸人，只好用手段，也就只好聽共自擾之了。自擾之也者，原來就是惟一的人生！</p>

<p>— 王里</p>
<p>第二天午後，我到達了黎莊橋。因爲至武進的航船已開，須待明天八時，才能搭到船，於是我就在這裹停下了脚。</p>
<p>我在一家茶館門首經過的時候，忽然一個不熟悉的人在我的背後把我一把抓住了。我一下子受驚而愕然着，那個人却微笑地看着我，指着茶館的店堂內對我說：「我們的班長請你！」</p>
<p>我更惶恐起來。</p>
<p>待我把眼睛向店堂內注視時，我才發現了一個微笑着向我的，我們的偵察班長的臉。我於是欣喜地跨了進去。</p>
<p>「你怎麼也到了這裏？」他先帶着笑臉問我。</p>
<p>「你們怎麼到這裏的呢？」我反問着。</p>
<p>隨後，他們告訴我捉到一個人的事情，並且把所搜到的文件給我看。</p>
<p>因爲我本來身子有點不好，叉走了長路，頭有點暈眩，所以預備找個地方睡一下。於是一個新加入我們偵察班的本地同志，就堅請代我去一家旅館裏開了一個房間。</p>
<p>决日上午八時，我搭了去武進的航船。因爲頭還有點暈眩，我把包袱枕着身子，側臥着。</p>
<p>船到了一個小村干的時候，下來了一個戴着黑眼鏡的人。當時誰也沒有注意到他，可是船到半路，是對方與我們的勢力的間隙之地，我正在朦朧的遐思，突然爲一個聲音所驚醒。回頭看時，帶黑眼鏡的那個人，手執着駁壳槍，從船梢後竄了出來。</p>
<p>「大家識相點！」</p>
<p>他用槍口指着我們喝着。</p>
<p>全船的人都愕然了。一</p>
<p>他開始用一隻手搜着每個人的身邊，搜得了東西，就很快的向衣袋裏塞。</p>
<p>這時我暗藏了一股憤怒，預備他搜到我的時候，就給他一個冷不防，拍掉他的槍。我做着無事似的，微閉着眼，依舊側臥地準備着。可是他抄了一陣，却把我遺漏掉，威脅船靠了岸，就逸去了。</p>
<p>一路上，船裏的人吭鬧着，相互地責怪着。</p>
<p>晚上六時，我踏上了另一個世界的土地。帶着像走入了地獄的感覺，我在燈火輝煌的武進街道上走着。</p>
<p>我看着熙攘往來的同胞，木立在街道上的僞警，耀眼的霓虹燈，焦木碎磚的敗屋……我默默的咬着牙，暗暗的流着悲憤之淚！</p>
<p>因爲我沒有良民證，走徧了所有的旅館，多遭了拒絕。最後，幾個老百姓指示了我秘密的旅館，並呌一個小孩子帶領我去。</p>
<p>這是在瓦礫堆中，一所用木板簡陋地修理了的半毀的房子，裏面像猪窩一樣的髒，地上放着幾張蓆子，另外一間有着二個破床。</p>
<p>這一夜，我頭很暈眩，身子很疲乏，但是興奮地睡不去，眼睜睜一直到了天亮。</p>
<p>第二天，我逃過了打防疫針搭了到無錫的輪船，午後換船到蘇州。</p>
<p>一路，我從船窗裏向外望着，所經過的鄉鎭，已半成了焦土。默默地，我讓仇恨之火，燃燒着了我的心，我又記慮着我的故鄉。</p>
<p>——故鄕大概也已成了焦土吧？悲哀地揣測着。但是我馬上責備着自己不應這樣想，我們偌大的土地已被佔去，數千萬的同胞失去了生命，失去了財產與自由，我不能私心地希望故鄉獨存，不能私心地吝惜我的故鄉！</p>
<p>到蘇州的途中，受了五决的檢查。在五决的檢查時，我是用了全身的力量抑制住了怒火。怒火把我的暈眩的頭更燒得暈眩了起來，身體像害了大病一樣的軟弱。</p>
<p>在蘇州宿了一夜，我搭了到故鄕的輪船。</p>
<p>在遠遠地看到了故鄉的時候，一種旣不是悲也不是喜的混亂的情緒，擾着了我的頭腦。</p>
<p>踏上了故土，我感到雖未經大災的故鄉，是巳在緊搯下變了樣了。</p>

<p>— 黎晨</p>
<p>牆脚邊生出芬芳的野花，榛莽間長起艷麗的花叢，常使一個困乏的旅人見了，浮上一絲安慰的微笑。是的，假使這動亂的世界是一片沙漠，牠是一點水源，而在這飛馳著風，霆的宇宙中，我們還因牠而望見霽色的雲天。</p>
<p>在寂寞中，花似乎是不安的人生的寗靜劑了。－誰不將牠當作創傷的靈魂的安慰呢？</p>
<p>然而，這世界似乎狹窄得可憐，竟不能容納任何一朶芬芳的花兒！</p>
<p>於是，當茫茫的旅途展開在面前的時候，每一個人像失去了舵的帆船一樣，隨風飄蕩；然而，風又將往那兒吹呢？却誰也不能知道。</p>
<p>找尋一朶花，一點創傷的慰藉，會經犧牲了無數的生命，爲了解放出壓在石隙里的芳草；爲了指引一隻迷途的羔羊；爲了美麗這世界，爲了溫暖這宇宙，誰會吝惜他的一掬汗，一滴血，乃至個人的生命呢？</p>
<p>穿過林莽，馳過沙漠，無數的人羣勇毅地踏上征途，背負了風霜，肩挑着苦難，僕僕風塵地走了一牛或者大牛的路途；不幸得很，有的在山徑中遇到獅虎，經過一塲猛烈的搏鬥，同歸於盡。有的爲了偶然的錯誤，吞下了劇毒的，而有着美麗的外衣的花朶，……</p>
<p>我感動了，對於這些「　志而歿」的人衆。用生命除去了阻礙，他遺留下一條未來的康莊，他們給人以「鬥爭」的昭示；他們給人以「毒花」的警惕。先人的遺產，還有比這「血的經驗」更爲寶貴的麼？</p>
<p>假使你眷戀於窗前的一點盆栽，假使你嚮往於溫室里的幾朶早花，那麼你應該向遠眺望一下：那充滿了絢爛的花叢的自由之天國，正向着你招手，奮勇地去尋求吧！先人的血肉已替你鋪下了大道！</p>

<h3 id="c132">商品展覽會參觀記 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 蘭燕</p>
<p>是鑑別國貨樣品的最好方法　希望與舶來品並烈以資比較</p>
<p>五月雖是個血的紀念日，但各種各式展覽會却忙得利害，蓬路有難民生產品展覽會，大新公司有美術界義賣，而昨天（十五日）下午二時起，在靜安寺路慕爾鳴路口，又有上海商品展覽會。</p>
<p>這次商品展覽會和各種商塲的展覽會，情形似乎不同。不久前有兩個新的市塲開幕，裏面各種店鋪，竟在推銷各種劣貨，這是多麼可恥呵！還有一個市塲開幕時候，竟有許多女明星去剪綵，這倒好像有點勸入去買劣貨，設身處地想一想，不能不使人憤慨的吧。那這决假上海新市塲裏面舉行的商品展覽會，參加的廠商，完全是國貨廠家，所有出品也經過嚴密的審查，所以這個展覽會，我以爲應包含以下兩種意義：</p>
<p>（一）獎勵新的國產出品——假如是過去所沒有的，商品展覽會應該給予特種獎勵；這樣可以鼓勵國產廠家，儘量發明及倣製。</p>
<p>（二）在商品展覽會中，如有新的國產用品或發明，商品展覽會應設法介紹或推銷。</p>
<p>（三）應詳細調查國產出品年來的改進及進步，並予獎勵及宣揚。</p>
<p>假如商品展覽會能够做到這幾點，那才有牠深刻的意義，吾則，僅僅做點國產樣品，它的效力，也是很小的。</p>
<p>昨天我參觀會塲的印象，覺得地方實在太小了一點。會塲是在新市塲最後一排商塲的二樓，靠左手樓梯上去，那裏有一所新開的「杏花村茶室」，也是咋天剛開慕的，但生意却好得可以。據說展覽會閉幕以後，這茶室將依然繼續營業。穿過一道小門，那就是大會的會塲，但因塲址狹小，每一家廠家所佔的地方都很小。</p>
<p>陳列的方法是把每一家廠商出品，都陳列在定製的橱窗裏，租賃的價格，規定上層是二十元，中層是三十元，底層是十元，如租一架完全橱窗，那便要六十元。</p>
<p>出品裏面，以藥品居多，其餘針織品，棉織品，橡膠製品，銀器，內衣，文具，繩帶，電器，油爐，肥皂等等。假使要鑑別國貨的樣品，這確是個很好的方法。但可惜，這些東西只能作爲樣品看，不賣，也不能動手。</p>
<p>我很希望下决這種展覽會塲，能够找一個廣大的塲子，廣事徵求國產樣品，同時，更能標明來路貨與國產品價格的比較，使主顧知道國產品的確便宜。</p>

<h3 id="c134">鋼筆醫院素描 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>你的自來水鋼筆損壞，不，生病了嗎？</p>
<p>現在在上海，正有一種所謂鋼筆醫院設立着。里面有許多醫師，他們會很詳細地檢查你的鋼筆有沒有病症，如果還有些微的痊愈的希望的話，那末他們的診察，治治療眞可謂是十分的盡力的。</p>
<p>病症不重的鋼筆，拿去經他們加以診療之後，當塲就可由所有者帶回；然而，病症較重些的呢，也就有「住院」等等的麻煩了，時期自一天起至一星期不等。</p>
<p>鋼筆醫院的集中點是在河南路商務印書館的四周：在那里，讀者們準可發現有許多專門修理自來水筆的店鋪開設着。戰前在南市動物院的附近，也有一家規模甚大的鋼筆醫院；此外在西門也有好幾家。</p>
<p>目前設備最完全，規模最大的一家，當推位在商務印書館附近的那家「鋼筆醫院」了。它們的招牌上面，還顯明地漆着一個紅十字，不懂的人看見了，還當眞的是一個醫院呢。</p>
<p>鋼筆醫院里的醫生說：「我們能夠治療任何關於鋼筆方面的疾病。」他們還說他們會拿一枝已經用不得的鋼筆，重新變成一枝新的，華麗的自來水筆。這，雖然也含有一大部份誇口在內，但是，無可否認地，他們的確能夠將那些稍為損壞些的鋼筆修好。</p>
<p>「我們的作事是很誠實的」，當我問一家鋼筆醫院里的助理員的時候，他回答我說：「隨便那種鋼筆拿來修理，我們都只收一些很便宜的手續費」。</p>
<p>隨手，他又拿出一把鋼筆出來，很得意地說：「這些鋼筆都是簇新的。許多人都以爲我們只出售舊貨，但是他們是錯了。這里是一家規矩的店鋪，如在大的公司里一樣，你也可以在這里得到很好的鋼筆。」</p>
<p>「這幾枝才是舊筆，」這個店員接着又拿出些舊的鋼筆來對我說：「我們從各處去搜羅這些舊貨，之後，加以相當的修理，再用低廉的價格出售。」他告訴我，由於外滙的高漲，舊貨倒也並未見得怎樣地便宜，普遍兩枝眞空管派克筆的售價，的值三十元至三十五元的左右。</p>
<p>同時，在這些鋼筆醫院里，也有筆尖售賣。普通的大概賣五毛錢一個，稍爲好一些的，則自一元起至十元止都有。</p>
<p>當他們修理鋼筆的時候，他們先得用一只放大鏡檢騐筆尖是否有裂痕；如果有的話，他們會立刻通知你必須要掉換一個筆尖；否則，在修畢之後，他們是很難討得顧客的歡喜的。</p>
<p>「好的鋼筆是經久不壞的」，這個店員繼續着說，「所以，你在選購鋼筆的時候，就得注意，切不可買那些改頭換面的劣貨。」</p>
<p>「平常不好的鋼筆總有兩種缺點，其一是吸水管的不能吸水，其二就是漏水。好的鋼筆是永遠不會漏水的。」</p>
<p>你在南京路或河南路上走走，你大槪會遇到那些向你兜賣像是新的，好的鋼筆的朋友吧。價錢眞是很便宜的，然而，我倒勸你不要云　這個便宜，這一種看看很好的鋼筆，用起來眞會嚇壞你，旣容易壞，拿到「鋼筆醫院」里去，那里的「醫生」或許也會不肯收留這一種「病人」，那你不是白花了錢嗎？（譯自英文大美晚報）</p>

<h3 id="c135">紅「藍」片與三原色片 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 仞之</p>
<p>蘇聯的「女壯士」是一部紅「藍」三原色的彩片。開映之後，輿論界一致稱頌。但是關於彩色成績的贊美，却有人提出異議。在這裏，我想把書本子上所看到的一些原理提供參考。不過希望不要以「內行」見譏，澆冷了我的就敎的誠意。</p>
<p>色，有光色與顏料色之別。太陽光裏雜有長短不同的光波。七色的呈現，便是由於光波的長短不同。白光通過了紅色膠片便呈現紅色。它的理由在於：紅色膠片時祇有紅光波能够通過，於是呈現了紅色。因爲相等成份的紅（Red）藍（Blue）綠（Green）三種光色混合成白色，所以通常稱紅藍綠爲光色的三原色。這和顏料色的三原色不同。就光色講，相等成份的藍綠二色混合成靑綠色（Blue-Green）此，兩份的靑綠色與一份的紅色混合，也成白色。這裏所稱爲紅「藍」便是靑綠。我們這就可以看出，從三原色裏所能得到的色彩，在紅「藍」二原色裏也能得到，不過因爲配合的成份不同，所以更爲麻煩。其實，紅藍混合成黃（Yellow），紅綠混成品紅（Magenta），將黃與綠或品紅與藍作爲二原色，也能得合樣的結果。物體顏色的產生與顏料色相同。一件物體，能吸收綠光波而反射紅與藍，便呈黃色。能吸收紅光波而反射藍與綠，便呈靑綠。能吸收藍光波而反射綠與紅，便呈現品紅。所以，譬如用三原色的鏡頭攝取黃色物體時，祇在紅片藍片上留有相當成份的影子，而綠片則無。用紅「藍」三原色的鏡頭攝取黃色物體時，紅片「藍」片（靑綠片）上都有影子，但其成份却又不同。這兩種拍攝的片子，當還原地映射出去的時候，在色彩的理論上，應該結果相同。在這裏，我們可以看出，在成份的配合方面，兩原色比三原色難。在拍攝的手續方面，兩原色比三原色簡單。無論如何，這决蘇聯拍攝兩原色彩片能有現在的成績，不能不說是相當的成功，而值得人們的欽佩。</p>

<p>第十回　椎髻靑裙賢良有母　銀髯翠袖矍鑠是翁</p>
<p>何雙玉便問道：「爲甚麼有允有不允呢？」朱村長道：「這也有種種關係，一時未能盡述。凡一個工廠的設立，於地方上也有合宜不合宜的，我們村中也要經一度的審查。像兩位小姐預備來開辦織綢廠，我想一定是通得過的。因爲我們這裹的許多村子，都是養蠶爲業的，每年所出產的生絲實在不少。生絲與絲織物，無論如何，總有速帶關係。雖然近年來，我國的生絲出口，巳佔世界第一，但國內所用的生絲，也很需要。曾記得八九年前，我們在戰爭時代，日本的生絲出口，一落千丈，而吾國的蠶事，也打了折扣。那時吾國各省，也曾極力提倡養蠶，一向不養蠶的省分，也養起蠶來，但終不能補工浙兩省之缺。美國第一個着急，他們用科學方法，發明各種人造絲來，可是終不及天然絲的合用。到了戰後，吾國絲業大興，美國，蘇俄，以及歐美各國，都要我們的絲，我們的生絲一躍而佔世界出口第一位。我們自己，爲了戰後節的起見，人民用絲織物倒少起來。不過我們的缺憾，就是微品的成貨，出口得很少。現在兩位小姐，來辦道個紡織廠，推銷織物到各國去，那是更進一層了。」何儂玉道：「我們辦這個廠，不能說是推銷國外貿易，有甚麼把握。也是父親有幾位江浙的老朋友，我們的父執了，他們有意於此。知道姪孫女輩，在美國時，學過紡織，有一點知識，我們就試辦試辦看。試想別國不出絲的，購進生絲來，製成熟品，運銷各國。我們出絲的國，所謂近水樓台，爲甚麼不能製成織物，行銷世界呢？既然江浙兩省是出絲的，而江浙兩省的絲織品又是出名的，因此我們想，這個廠一定要設立在江浙地方。這裏是個新村，是公公的一番心血，組織而成的。又是愛人的家鄕，我們也很願植立個基礎在此地，一切要請公公帮助我們，敎導我們。」朱村長道：「一個地方上，多一個工廠，足以增加地方上的繁盛。我們當然願意兩位小姐的廠，設立在我們這裏。吃過了飯以後，我們就隨便去看看。倘然覺得合宜的，我們再提出於村議會裏就是了。」（一一三）</p>

<p>今年夏天不出門可看電影　售價昂貴暫時怕不能普遍</p>
<p>（三）研究的進步</p>
<p>有了一種方法之後，一般研究電視影片的人，興趣就集中在陰極射綫的研究上，目前所採用的正是這種。另外，和這種電視影片相對的，還發明了一種威廉潑萊斯的震力傳聲鏡，用一架開麥拉，一種乾片，（很像攝影用的乾片），裝在陰極射管上面。這乾片上蓋有無數的感光細胞，而影像就集中在這乾片上。一種陰極射電子光橫跨在這乾片，把影像的綫一條條吸去，而很快的把影傳出來。開麥拉和收影機的動作是完全一致的，同樣的影像多次的送出去和接收到。一方面是直綫的擺動，另一面是平綫的擺動。用這種方法，影片一定要有四百四十一條綫。才能把影像多次的傳達。在傳影的時候，聲槽之中，同時更傳出聲音來，而在收影的一方，各種符號，一定要分散而放大的。</p>
<p>（四）售價的昂貴</p>
<p>機件的構造旣然這樣復雜，無論是傳影或收影的機器，當然要比普通的無綫電播間機或收音機成本要貴得多。在這種情形之下，影片的尺寸一定要很適當，而一架好的收影機，所映出的影片，至少有七時半乘十時大小，這樣就要用巨大的陰極射管，但價錢是很貴的。大槪每架值美金三百五十元至五百元。假如你一定要出較少的錢，那你就祇能看到較小的三時乘四時的影片，而值價大約每架自美金一百五十元至二百元。在目前，再要便宜的收影機，大槪還冒不到。大號的陰極射管，需要強有力的保護物。限定着影片，用高度的電流，不一定有意外的危險；但由於自動發火和透熱的機器，可使銀幕上會有「雪花」。而最後，非要用二百條綫代替四百四十一條綫的影片不可，這便成為一個電視影片上的重要問題。然而一般的工程師却表示樂觀，以為這些小問題的處置是很容易的，據說待陰極射綫電視影片風行之後，幾年之中，就可解決。（完）</p>

<p>創闢好萊塢式玻璃播音室　另設花園飯店申曲文戲塲　國際跳舞廳取消闢作商塲</p>
<p>上海遊藝塲所以能終年擠滿了各種各式人物，主要的是創辦人想用極低廉的票價和各省各地的地方戲，來吸引寄居上海各地的人物，這一種策略，當然是收穫到極大的效果的。</p>
<p>比如大世界新世界和各公司的遊樂塲，那一個地方不終年客滿？但是，自從國軍西撤以後，各遊藝塲為了吸引主顧，不得不大大地廉價，把票價减低到最低的限度，如大世界最高也只賣兩毛錢，而且是買一送一：像新世界遊藝塲索性只賣五分錢，也可算是不能再便宜的了。</p>
<p>「但是因為各大公司遊藝塲，人一分散，票價又便宜，遊藝塲收入，自然不會比從前好多少，為了這點，而決定想變更策略，走一條向上的路，那就是新新屋頂花園了。</p>
<p>大約不留心遊藝塲消息的人，是不會注意到新新屋頂花園的停頓吧，實際上，他已經停止營業了好多天了。</p>
<p>和新新屋頂花園同時歇業的，還有附屬於新新公司的國際舞塲。現在讓我分開來談談新新屋頂花園未來的計劃。</p>
<p>據新新公司負責人蕭宗俊先生說：他們決定把過去新新屋頂花園的遊藝塲取消，而用較高的票價，吸引上層的觀衆。</p>
<p>他的計劃是如此；在公司的六層樓，預備花六萬元，裝修成以下幾所新的遊樂塲：</p>
<p>（一）玻璃棚播音室——上海播音室從來都沒有化過很大資本，來建築玻璃棚的，假如有，我們只能在好萊塢電影上看見過，而現在他們已決定建築這樣一個考究的玻璃播音室。播音的時候，外面可以完全看見內部的一切。</p>
<p>（二）有聲電影塲——和新華公司合作，專映新華二輪影片。</p>
<p>（三）申曲塲——已聘定筱文濱長期演唱。</p>
<p>（四）紹興文戲——班底尚未聘定，但也決定聘請上海第一流的班子。</p>
<p>（五）花園飯店——就在玻璃播音室的外面，全是西餐，熱天備有冷氣。</p>
<p>遊藝塲票價共分五角八角兩種，座椅設備統統是新的，大約最晚六月底準可開幕。</p>
<p>以綠寶劇塲之營業發達，這個吸收上層主顧的辦法，大約總可操勝算吧。</p>
<p>關於舞塲，屋頂本來想設一個露天舞塲的，但因為各種問題太麻煩，決定作罷。</p>
<p>國際舞塲原址，闢作新新公司的商塲，以後國際舞塲，也只能算一種遺跡了吧</p>

<p>保險百萬金元</p>
<p>好萊塢影城中，狄安娜竇萍這個影星要算最出風頭了。她演戲的確令人佩服；她的歌唱更好。她現在，是新環球公司的台柱明星之一，滿庭芳片中所唱的幾支曲子，由影院奏到舞塲，同舞塲而吹（口吹也）到廣大的人間，到處風行，另外像「小鳥依人」「荳蔻年華」「丹鳳朝陽」等片在世界大城市，賣座都好。其實竇萍現在只有十六歲還不能算是一個十分成年的明星，一般人都認為她未來的前程，希望很大。新環球公司當局，對於她的嗓子更非常注意，最近特與紐約一保險公司訂定合同，將竇萍的嗓子，保險百萬金元，此數字與秀蘭鄧波兒的人濤保險金額相等。影星之豪華，真可謂無獨有偶了。</p>

<p>茶餘酒後，扣絃而歌，樂事也。玩琴而能登台，更加高興，然而也有局外人不知道的苦味，譬如你會拉而並不甚好，人家為了你是票友，馬馬虎虎請你効勞，其實不是為你技術高，原因是為不要化錢；你呢，以為出鋒頭機會，不知道一臨塲，動輒得咎，塲面上議論紛紛，前後台交頭接耳，你弄得汗流滿面，勞而無功，寃哉！寃哉！</p>
<p>你如果是個好手呢，今天張三請你帮忙，明兒個李四要你辛苦，於是天天播音彩排，日日義務客串，如果全要應允，祇恨分身乏術，設或一槪謝絕，人人罵你狗矢；且你身為大爺，時時臨塲出馬，不知者以為塲面紅客。</p>
<p>家中消遣最好，而胡琴習非破就是要塌，北風凜冽呢，有高而無低；此外如燒松香，髒得不堪，換　綫，牙齒要咬傷，這些都不是開心的事情。現在海上人滿為患，五六家住一所房屋，你想過　不行，早晨是三層樓嫂嫂不答應，她要過十二點才起床；下午亭子間阿姨打中覺；夜裏頭十點一打是工部局有定章，遠章是要罰錢的。咱們不能為過　而弄麻煩是不是？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan’s Demand to Amend Shanghai Land Regulations Sternly Rejected by U.S. Government; U.S. Urges Return of Area North of Suzhou Creek to Municipal Council; British, American, and French Navies Jointly Land on Gulangyu; Majority of Japanese Troops Withdraw, Public Confidence Restored <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) – The U.S. State Department yesterday officially rejected Japan’s request to amend the Land Regulations of the Shanghai International Settlement. The American note, delivered to Tokyo by Ambassador Grew, stated that this issue cannot be considered until the situation returns to stability. The note further declared that, given the abnormal circumstances created by Japan’s military aggression in China, no satisfactory resolution of Settlement matters can be achieved at present between the United States and Japan. The note not only warned Japan against exploiting this turbulent season to undermine the internationally governed Settlement, but also urged Japan to return the area north of Suzhou Creek to the Settlement Municipal Council. It stated:</p>
<p>“Regarding any necessary amendments to the Land Regulations, the United States, as in the past, is prepared to engage in friendly and systematic formal negotiations. However, the United States must point out that Shanghai’s current condition is far from normal, and thus there is fundamentally no basis for fair and comprehensive discussion of these complex issues by the parties concerned.”</p>
<p>The note continued:</p>
<p>“The Settlement authorities have endeavored to carry out their normal peacetime duties, but the Japanese military authorities’ refusal to restore the area north of Suzhou Creek to Settlement control, along with unlawful activities in areas adjacent to the Settlement, has severely hampered the Council’s ability to perform its functions. The United States again urges Japan to consider that, by acknowledging the excellent work of the Settlement authorities and returning full jurisdiction over the area north of Suzhou Creek to the Council, the efficiency of the Settlement administration would invariably be enhanced. In short, the United States observes that the development of the Shanghai Settlement has largely depended on the dedicated efforts of expatriate communities of various nations for the public good. In this development, the Settlement occupies a critically important position; therefore, anything that affects the Settlement’s status and welfare will also affect a majority of nations, the United States included. Regarding amendments to the Land Regulations, the United States believes that discussion must await a generally more stable period.”</p>
<p>It is also reported on authority that, concerning Japan’s demand for greater governing authority within the Settlement, Secretary of State Hull has been in communication with Ambassador Grew and U.S. Consul‑General Gauss in Shanghai. It is said that, before this note was delivered to Tokyo, the United States had been in contact with other concerned powers. It is expected that Britain’s reply to Japan will be substantively identical to the American note, stating that, in view of the abnormal military circumstances resulting from Japan’s aggression in China, now is not the time to amend the Land Regulations. (18th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hull</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) – According to Japanese sources in Xiamen today, most Japanese troops on Gulangyu withdrew several hours before the British, American, and French naval landings. Only a small detachment remains on the island’s Settlement. The island’s Chinese and foreign residents, relieved by the arrival of Allied forces, now feel secure. The few Japanese troops still stationed in the Settlement have gradually concentrated around the Japanese‑run hospital. Reports indicate that the number of British and American Marines who landed on Gulangyu matched the number of Japanese troops remaining. The Anglo‑American landing took place at 6 p.m. yesterday, and the French cruiser Bading arrived later and sent troops ashore at midnight. Observers note that this swift joint action by the British, American, and French navies has transformed Gulangyu’s status from perilous to secure, a development that will significantly influence Japanese policy toward the Shanghai International Settlement going forward. (18th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Washington) – The U.S. government has recently informed the Japanese government that it rejects Japan’s current request to revise the Land Regulations of the Shanghai International Settlement and to alter the status of the Chinese courts within the Settlement, and it has asked Japan to hand back to the Settlement Municipal Council the areas north of Suzhou Creek currently occupied by Japanese forces. (18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Foreign Warships Concentrate at Gulangyu</p>
<p>Gulangyu – Of the two hundred Japanese sailors who landed here last Friday, most had withdrawn by nightfall, and only forty‑two remained this morning. At 6 p.m. last night, forty‑two sailors each from Britain, America, and France landed here, matching the number of Japanese troops still present. Before the Allied landings, Admiral Noble, commander of the British China fleet, had warned the Japanese that if their troops did not immediately withdraw, British forces would also go ashore, declaring that there could be no arbitrary changes to Gulangyu’s statutes or its Municipal Council. Yesterday, two destroyers also arrived offshore. Present here are one British cruiser, three British destroyers, one American cruiser, one American destroyer, and one French cruiser—international warships now assembled on the island. (18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>The Zilin Daily reports that on Tuesday, British China fleet commander Admiral Noble arrived at Gulangyu aboard the cruiser Birmingham and will remain indefinitely to observe developments. Noble was originally scheduled to reach Shanghai on the 19th but has since delayed his arrival. Meanwhile, the cruiser Touseisha, set to depart Shanghai shortly after Birmingham’s arrival, will remain in port until the Admiral leaves Gulangyu for Shanghai. Other sources indicate Admiral Noble will stay on Gulangyu for two days before proceeding by ship from Xiamen to Shanghai.</p>
<p>U.S. Far East Policy Turns Proactive</p>
<p>(New York) – Reports in local papers state that the U.S. government has sternly rejected Japan’s demand to increase the number of Japanese representatives on the Settlement Municipal Council. The rejection note, delivered yesterday by Ambassador Grew, is this morning’s focus. These papers link it to the Anglo‑American landings at Xiamen—viewed as the first step in an “active American Far East policy” and a demonstration that Britain and the United States have already taken joint action to safeguard their common interests in the region. (18th, Havas)</p>
<p>Surprise Expressed in Tokyo</p>
<p>(Tokyo) – Today, Foreign Ministry officials declined to predict the next Japanese military move regarding the Settlement, while a naval spokesperson expressed astonishment at the sudden Anglo‑American‑French landings on Gulangyu. Although the Foreign Ministry refused to comment on future operations, it is understood that Washington’s opposition to Japan’s proposed amendments to the Settlement’s Land Regulations will have the following consequences: (1) Japan will hesitate before sending troops into other foreign concessions in China; (2) Japan may renew efforts to conclude military pacts with European powers; (3) Japan will reproach the Western powers for failing to understand Japan’s objectives in China. Today, Foreign Minister Matsuoka informed the British Ambassador, Sir Robert Craigie, that the Japanese landing on Gulangyu was an emergency measure to protect Japanese residents and that the troops would soon be withdrawn. The same assurance was given in Japan’s formal reply to Britain’s protest. The naval spokesperson said he was surprised by the Allies’ sudden landing, noting that last year Japanese forces had also landed there without provoking any protest from Britain, France, or the United States. He declared the Allied action “unnecessary” and reiterated that last year, between May 22 and July 31, Japanese naval troops had landed on Gulangyu without any protest from foreign consuls. He insisted the current operation was purely a security measure and saw no link between it and Japan’s demands to amend the Land Regulations or reorganize the Municipal Council. (18th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) – Naval spokesperson Kanazawa, responding today to questions about the Gulangyu affair, admitted that before the Marines landed, Japanese residents on the island had neither been attacked nor suffered property damage. He claimed the Japanese Navy viewed the Allied landing as an emergency self‑defense measure but saw no need for Britain or the United States to take similar action. He said he could not understand why Japan’s actions on Gulangyu should provoke such alarm abroad, since last year, when Japanese troops also landed there, no protest was raised. (18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) – Last night, the Foreign Ministry sent its reply to Britain’s protest over the Japanese landing on Gulangyu to the British Embassy; the contents have not yet been made public. (18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Favorable Impression Among Chinese</p>
<p>(Chongqing) – The resolute stance taken by the great powers over the Gulangyu incident has left a very positive impression on the Chinese here. It shows (1) that the great powers will not be intimidated by Japanese threats and will adopt even firmer measures in future negotiations with Japan; (2) that a steadfast position by the powers will cause Japan to retract. This morning’s editorial in the Chongqing United Daily states that Japan is gradually stripping away the rights of foreigners in China, aiming to eliminate them entirely. It is clear that to safeguard their interests, the great powers must employ forceful measures—any conciliation or concession would merely encourage further Japanese advances. (18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>U.S. State Department Issues Communiqué</p>
<p>(Washington) – Today, the State Department issued a communiqué explaining the current situation on Gulangyu, stating: (1) At 6 p.m. local time, the naval authorities of Britain and the United States each decided to deploy a small Marine detachment to land on the island to protect the Settlement; (2) the American cruiser Marblehead and destroyer Palmart, and the British cruiser Birmingham and three destroyers, are all stationed at Xiamen; (3) the Japanese naval landing force, which numbered 150 when it went ashore on the 11th, has now been reduced to forty-two. (17th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) – According to the State Department’s statement last night, fearing that the Japanese might seek to occupy the International Settlement and cause unrest, the U.S. Navy landed forces on Gulangyu yesterday to protect American lives and property. The landing force was not large. The Marblehead and Palmart are both now anchored at Xiamen. (18th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(London) – Reuters has learned from the British Admiralty that British, French, and American warships at Xiamen each landed forty-two Marines on the Settlement at Gulangyu, matching the number of Japanese troops already ashore. (17th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Hull Addresses Reporters</p>
<p>(Washington) – Concerning Japan’s request to the Shanghai Municipal Council, Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that he could not reveal the contents of the Japanese proposal, which the State Department is reviewing. A reply will be issued shortly. The same reply will apply to both the Shanghai and Xiamen (Gulangyu) Settlements. Meanwhile, officials here say the State Department is consulting with Ambassador Grew in Tokyo and Consul‑General Gauss in Shanghai to draft its response, and is maintaining contact with other governments involved. (17th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) – Secretary Hull stated today that, regarding the Shanghai Settlement, the Department is preparing a note to Japan in reply to its request to increase the number of Japanese members on the Municipal Council. The contents of the note are not being disclosed, but informed sources say that the United States is already in consultation with Britain and France on this matter. (17th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Zilin Daily’s Commentary on the Gulangyu Incident</p>
<p>Since the Gulangyu affair, Western newspapers in Shanghai have published editorials condemning Japanese actions. Even the measured Zilin Daily has strongly voiced its opinion. In a short commentary titled “Reaction to Gulangyu,” translated in yesterday’s Japanese papers, the Daily criticized Japan’s demands. Yesterday it ran a full editorial titled “The Gulangyu Incident,” from which we translate the following excerpts:</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there was no sign that the situation on Gulangyu had improved. Japan had sent armed forces to land on the island, placing the Municipal Settlement effectively under Japanese military control, and had presented five demands aimed at placing municipal administration entirely in Japanese hands. Judging from Japan’s proposals of May 14 to the Settlement Municipal Council, these demands were the result of deliberate calculation. The Council’s reply—which we understand Japan could not accept—simply stated that, according to the Land Regulations forming the basis of the Settlement, the Council could not comply with Japan’s proposed changes. Given all the facts, this was the only stance the Council could justly adopt. If Japan’s demands were fully accepted, it would amount to handing over to Japan the rights and special privileges assigned to the International Settlement and converting an administration of an international character into one solely under Japanese control. Although the number of other foreign representatives on the Municipal Council would remain unchanged, in practice Council resolutions would be executed only by Japanese officials.</p>
<p>Any guarantees Japan now makes about avoiding interference with third‑party rights ring hollow in light of these demands. Foreigners in Chinese treaty ports enjoy clear and defined rights, including membership in international bodies to manage their own affairs. Any infringement on these rights is an unwarranted interference with the interests of foreigners, and Japan’s actions clearly seek to curtail these rights.</p>
<p>While wartime inevitably brings incidental impacts on neutrals, the present case is different: it rests entirely on the use of force to alter rights that have long been legally established, with no plausible justification. This is something we must keep in mind: Japan cannot establish a “new order in Asia” by trampling on fixed, recognized rights, let alone by violating its own assurances. Japan’s demands make it unmistakably clear that it intends to place the administration of Gulangyu’s International Settlement entirely under Japanese control—even while superficially retaining a few non‑Japanese representatives on the Council, who, under the circumstances, would be mere puppets. Japan’s deployment of troops was effectively a show of force to coerce the Municipal Council into making concessions it had no authority to grant. Unless the Council refers matters to the Consular Corps—which alone has the power to agree to amendments to the Settlement’s status—it has no recourse. Even the Consular Corps must obtain instructions and approval from their respective governments before acting.</p>
<p>Japan’s proposal to cooperate with the Council to curb anti‑Japanese activities may seem benign, but today there is no legitimate Chinese organization empowered to nominate the three Chinese Council members Japan seeks. Any nominees would inevitably be seen as Japanese puppets, proving Japan’s true intent: to seize full control of what should be an international administration. Japan’s tentative actions on Gulangyu should be recognized as a challenge to the other treaty powers concerned, and cannot be ignored. If they publicly affirm that Japan must not be allowed to change Gulangyu’s status by force, they will send Japan a message it cannot misunderstand and will uphold their own positions in this part of the world (Shanghai).</p>

<h3 id="e2">Rule of Law in Shanghai <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Within a single day yesterday, four Shanghai newspapers were severely punished. The papers differed in ownership, in the form and severity of punishment, and in the stated reasons; what they had in common was that they were all Chinese‑language papers thriving on Anglo‑American commerce. Such a large‑scale suppression would occur only during a profound upheaval of the state and its authority; there is no precedent for this in Shanghai, and it cannot be judged by ordinary standards of common sense or propriety. Moreover, although these four cases were actions taken by official agencies and must be regarded as exercises of legal authority, the nature of those actions—whether political, administrative, or policing—varies; whether legal or illegal, within or beyond jurisdiction, appropriate or excessive, there are standards for judgment, but no single principle covers all. Once a matter becomes one of legal authority, from the moment that authority is invoked until the issue is resolved according to law, no individual views or personal sentiments are permitted to influence the process. This is the realm of modern legal governance and freedom of the press, which must be strictly upheld. The suppression of these four papers is exactly what we find most distressing—nearly suffocating.</p>
<p>We respect the spirit of legal governance and would not ordinarily comment on the content of cases once they have become matters of legal authority. Yet we feel compelled to raise our voices in defense of the rule of law. Two months ago, Shanghai had descended into a state of terror, and the authorities scrambled for measures to respond. We observed: “If anyone wants to destroy Shanghai, no one… If anyone can destroy Shanghai, everyone…” and we advocated for “establishing rigorous methods suited to reality” and hoped that “all parties would exercise mutual restraint and adhere to strict procedures.” Six days ago, speaking of the desire for Shanghai’s stability, we wrote: “Each should fulfill their role, and above all confirm every legal status; opinions may differ, but obeying the law is reasonable, and only by obeying the law can normalcy be maintained.” We also said: “Perverting or breaking the law equally destroys it; once the law is destroyed, there is nothing to protect, and each will act as they please to their own ruin. Such destruction is internal collapse, not to be blamed on the larger environment.” All of this stemmed from faith in the rule of law and a profound trust in Shanghai’s governance—relying solely on the law.</p>
<p>To speak of legal governance in Shanghai does not imply that Shanghai’s authorities have, to date, acted in a lawless manner. But Shanghai’s circumstances appear to cast doubt on whether strict adherence to established rules can adapt to the present environment; and yet, to abandon the law in desperation or to rely on extralegal measures in the name of “understanding” and “cooperation” seems excessively high‑minded and divorced from reality. Such painstaking efforts deserve sympathy from the enlightened, but will they produce better outcomes or worse? Those who believe in the rule of law have a clear answer: without law, without governance—if one destroys the law to preserve order, it is as futile as seeking fish in a tree. Moreover, wavering in one’s faith in the rule of law only exacerbates the underlying instability. This is an undeniable truth.</p>
<p>Today, however, the fundamental issues concerning Shanghai have been addressed with clarity by the firm stance of Britain and the United States, which insist that all matters relating to Shanghai be governed according to the Land Regulations, the international treaty by which the Settlement is constituted. This claim is the most reasonable and must prevail, and it will restore stability to Shanghai’s foundations. Once stability is reestablished, not only will there be internal respect for the rule of law, but the conditions for robust enforcement of the law will be greatly enhanced. We advise the Settlement authorities: up to now, whatever measures have been taken within the Settlement, whether trusted and welcomed by residents of all nations or met with suspicion and resentment, there has been no dispute over their legality. Therefore, from today on, advancing the rule of law and demonstrating its spirit remain entirely feasible. The authorities must show, in every measure, the legal basis of their actions, so that all can see clearly that they are lawful and willingly submit to legal governance. Even the rare suppression of the four papers in Shanghai calls for explicit explanation.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) – According to reports, the Japanese forces attacking the Valley Wharf at Heshan were repelled by Chinese troops yesterday. Currently, the majority of Japanese forces along the lower Xijiang River have concentrated at Jiujiang and Heqing, intending to cross the river. Heavy fighting continues on the New Heshan and Jiangfu routes. Ozawa’s detachment, after a day of bloody battle yesterday, has been driven back. (18th, Special Cable)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing – At 7 a.m. this morning, two Japanese shallow‑draft vessels approached under Heshan County, opened fire on the shore, and launched several rubber boats to attack Huangbaokeng. The Chinese garrison rose up and drove them back. (18th, Local Report)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing – After recapturing the strongpoints at Tangxia and Jinggen, Xinhui’s Chinese forces pressed forward swiftly. Over the past two days, their vanguard reached Qianjin on the Fen Shui River between Mau Wo and Damaishi, where they cleared out remaining enemy elements, and dispatched units to advance around Yunfeng and Guifeng mountains. Huicheng is expected to fall at any moment. (18th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan – On the morning of the 17th, a Japanese detachment advanced from Shilong toward Boluo and by noon reached Changning Lake west of Hualongwei, intending to attack Boluo. Chinese forces are conducting a pincer encirclement. (18th, Special Cable)</p>

The Chinese forces penetrated Japanese positions, destroyed two Japanese artillery pieces, and killed more than twenty Japanese soldiers. Another unit attacked Jishan, reaching areas north of the city near Zhangjiadian, Gaomao Village, and Hanjiazhuang on the 14th, where they clashed with Japanese troops. The Japanese garrison of over 400 at Yuanping in North Shanxi had harassed Chinese positions at Zhangjiadian and Dazheng (southeast of Qixian, east of Juhe River) on the 11th at noon, suffering heavy casualties in a Chinese counterattack. At noon on the 12th, they made another eastward incursion but were once again repelled. On the morning of the 13th, Japanese units advancing westward in western Shanxi and Jingle were ambushed by Chinese forces near Liujiacun, inflicting over twenty casualties and forcing them back into the town.

<h3 id="e6">Japanese Violation of British Interests in China – Britain Must Stand Firm in Resistance – The Yangtze Cannot Be Permanently Blockaded by Japan – Speech by the Chairman of the China Society in London <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today Mr. Schwyer, Chairman of the China Society, in his address at the annual meeting, stated that in his personal view the Yangtze River issue has become a symbolic means for critics to attack Britain’s position in China. As for whether Britain should permanently allow Japan to enter the Yangtze and maintain a long-term blockade, that is highly questionable. Mr. Schwyer went on to welcome the creation of a Chinese Currency Stabilization Fund as a much-needed measure, since it could demonstrate British sympathy for China and serve as a clear signal to His Majesty’s Government of the United Kingdom’s concern for the war. He continued by expressing the hope that the government would uphold this position and make every effort to resist Japanese infringements on British interests in China. In past incidents, the British government has been intimidated by the Japanese into making unnecessary concessions. Mr. Schwyer further discussed monetary issues in North China and the Japanese-imposed trade restrictions, asserting that if the British Empire and the United States continue to purchase Chinese products under such conditions, there would be no justifiable reason to doubt that Japan will use a significant portion of the proceeds to defray its military expenses. At the same time, he proposed effectively eliminating foreign competition outside North China. Mr. Schwyer anticipated that British merchants would again demand that the authorities prohibit the importation into North China of British goods unless accompanied by consular certificates indicating that the goods were purchased on an open market for freely convertible foreign exchange. He hoped the government would consider this suggestion sooner rather than later. Mr. Schwyer has been duly elected Chairman of the China Society; his Deputy Chairman is Mr. Baker. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Soviet Report on Japan’s Reserve Forces – Japan’s Decline is Irrefutable</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Red Star newspaper, in an article on the manpower reserves of the Japanese Army, stated: “The prolonged war in China has not only exhausted Japan’s economy and finances, but its reserve manpower is also steadily weakening. Experts estimate that Japan has no fewer than 8.5 million men of conscription age who fully meet military service requirements. However, as the material living standards and economic conditions of Japan’s working masses have deteriorated in recent years, an increasing number of conscripts are medically unfit for service. In 1936, out of every thousand conscripts, as many as five hundred were deemed unfit. At the same time, desertions during conscription, feigned illnesses, forged documents, and self-inflicted injuries to evade service have continued to rise. It is estimated that in 1933 there were as many as thirty thousand such draft‑evaders. Once enlisted and dispatched to the front lines, there have frequently been incidents of insubordination to officers or refusal to serve. Japan’s Army Reserve primarily draws from the rural population. At present, 25 to 30 percent of eligible rural recruits have already been conscripted into active service. Japan’s combat engineers are mainly recruited from civil servants, the urban and rural petty bourgeoisie, and small landowners; they receive specialized training upon enlistment. In the future, engineers will have to be drawn from skilled industrial workers, but such workers are few in number in Japan, and drafting the necessary quota of them would adversely affect the military-industrial sector. Henceforth, the Japanese militarists will undoubtedly conscript large numbers of reserve troops from colonial populations. However, preliminary trials have already proven such reserves to be unreliable. Colonial or occupied Chinese troops, when facing Chinese Nationalist or guerrilla forces, frequently surrender en masse. Within Japan itself, it has been demonstrated that the military’s claim of an indomitable national spirit and will to fight is rapidly diminishing. Thus, the unreliability of Japan’s Army Reserve has, of itself, become an inescapable fact.” (TASS, 17th)</p>

<p>Nanyang—Since the 15th, the North Hubei Chinese Army has launched a full-scale offensive against the Japanese. One unit attacked the Japanese at Tongbai with fierce intensity. After a fierce battle that lasted until the morning of the 16th, the Japanese, unable to hold their ground, retreated to Huaihe Shop. Tongbai was immediately recaptured, and the Chinese forces pursued and retook Huaihe Shop. The highway between Tongbai and Huaihe Shop is now clear of Japanese presence. In this engagement, over 4,000 Japanese were killed, with countless prisoners taken; investigations are ongoing. Another unit advanced from Tanghe and Xinye, attacking Japanese positions at Pingtian Town, Huyang Town, and Guo­tan Town. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese were completely routed and the areas were secured. The remnants of the Japanese forces have gathered near Zaoyang, where the Chinese Army is now vigorously pursuing them. Tanghe and Xinye counties are free of Japanese troops and order has been restored. On the 16th, Chinese forces launched a fierce assault on Japanese positions northwest of Zaoyang at Yangjiachang, and after intense fighting until last night, the Japanese were completely annihilated.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to a Chungking telegraph, on the 15th a Chinese unit attacked Japanese forces east of Zhongxiang, killing their transport commander, Lin Zhou, along with over a hundred soldiers, burning 37 Japanese vehicles, and seizing large quantities of arms and ammunition. Another Chinese division attacked Japanese forces at [location redacted]; Zhongxiang is now under Chinese control. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Yichang) After days of intense fighting in central and northern Hubei, Japanese losses have been extremely heavy. The 3rd Division, Japan’s most elite unit, has been completely destroyed by Chinese forces, with two regiments almost entirely annihilated. The remaining Japanese in northern Hubei have been forced east of Xianghua Road by the advancing Chinese. The two armies are still engaged in fierce fighting north of Jingzhong Road. On the Xiang-Yi Line, Chinese forces are steadily pushing eastward, and Japanese forces at Zaoshi are showing signs of wavering. A Chinese detachment has reached Jingzhong Road and is advancing forward. In Tianmen, Chinese troops have broken into the city walls; the Japanese main force has withdrawn outside the city, and Tianmen is expected to fall soon. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chungking) Reports from Chinese sources here, based on military communications from the Hubei front, warn that the Japanese are urgently planning to invade and occupy Xiangyang and Fancheng. Their concentrated efforts aim to: (1) encircle and attack the Chinese forces guarding Suixian, Tongbai, and the outskirts of Zaoyang near the Dabie Mountains and Dahongshan; (2) besiege Nanyang, a key city on the Henan‑Hubei border. Consequently, a major battle is expected soon on the Nanyang front. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The Japanese forces that had invaded Tanghe were repelled by the main Chinese force with over a thousand casualties. The retreating troops were intercepted by local militia near Huyang Bo, who exploited the terrain to surround the Japanese, inflicting heavy losses. The survivors fled northeast to Taiping Town, Zaoyang. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Shashi—After reclaiming Yuekou, Chinese forces forced the remaining Japanese to retreat toward Tianmen. Chinese main forces are now advancing on Tianmen, gradually capturing strongpoints. The Japanese garrison inside is in a state of panic. On the 17th, the Japanese used thirteen motor vehicles, three towed guns, and large quantities of heavy equipment to move toward Zaoshi to guard against a Chinese attack, suggesting preparations for withdrawal. (17th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chungking) According to reliable reports here, 10,000 Japanese troops have been dispatched to Kaifeng as reinforcements. Towns along the Longhai Railway and in northern Henan have been bombed by Japanese aircraft. The Japanese Air Force is also highly active along the Yellow River, indicating a possible advance south along the Longhai and Pinghan Lines to link up their forces in northern Hebei and southern Henan. This move is intended to compensate for their losses in that area while continuing to advance toward Nanyang. Meanwhile, Chinese forces have completely repelled Japanese assaults on Tanghe and Xinye, inflicting severe losses on them in both places. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Incident of Two British Vessels Detained in South China <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo—Naval Department spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa, in response to inquiries about the detention of two British vessels in South China, stated that of the two, the Sullustris had been boarded by a Japanese naval officer in Chao’an Bay near Shantou. It was found to be carrying large numbers of regular Chinese soldiers, demonstrating that the vessel was clearly used by the Chinese authorities for military purposes. Although the ship was registered in Britain, many points required clarification, so it was to be held at Macao for further investigation. It was discovered among its cargo was Chinese government salt, and that the vessel had previously made seven voyages carrying the same cargo. Under these circumstances, the Japanese naval authorities concluded that the Sullustris was not engaged in peaceful commerce but was assisting the Nationalist Government; hence further investigation was necessary. The spokesman added that he hoped British merchant ships would avoid actions that might cause Japanese misunderstanding in the future, and stated that he had not yet heard of the detention of the other British vessel.

<h3 id="e15">Two Proposals of Note in the Production Conference Draft – Assistance for Chinese Small‑Scale Industry, Promotion of a New Cooperative Movement <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Chungking) The financial community here is particularly pleased with two points in the draft proposals of the National Production Conference. First, the government has decided to instruct provincial governments and banks, within feasible limits, to assist Chinese small‑scale industries in areas behind Japanese lines. Second, the government has resolved to vigorously promote a new cooperative movement, recognizing that small‑scale industrialists may suffer losses once their localities are occupied by Japanese forces. Plans call for providing loans at the lowest possible interest rates, with any losses due to the invasion to be written off and repaid by the government. This measure will reduce the fears of small industrialists and, once fully implemented, will serve as China’s best weapon against Japan’s “economic development” efforts. It will enable Chinese behind Japanese lines to avoid economic dependence on Japan. As peasants, no matter how patriotic, without clothing or food they have no choice but to purchase Japanese goods. China’s plan is to prevent them from buying Japanese products and encourage them to use domestic goods. It is also planned to establish a National Cooperative Bank with capital of 10 million yuan to develop cooperatives, which will also serve as an economically valuable weapon.

<h3 id="e18">Chungking Initiates Large‑Scale Evacuation Measures; Mayor Announces Four Regulations; Air Defense Facilities Also Strengthened <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Chungking) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek yesterday issued directives instructing the Chungking authorities to implement large‑scale evacuation measures to guard against Japanese air raids. The first directive is to boost morale for the war; the second and fourth pertain to the evacuation plan; the third is to increase agricultural production. After receiving these orders, the newly appointed mayor of Chungking, He Guoguang, issued a notice detailing four regulations: (1) conduct a household census; (2) construct fire‑ and wind‑resistant barriers; (3) register the population for evacuation planning; (4) reorganize various service corps to work closely with the Garrison Command. Among these four measures, only the population registration will require more time; the other three can be completed shortly. In addition, the authorities have decided to establish an Evaluation Committee, in cooperation with the Chamber of Commerce, to regulate prices—especially of daily necessities—to maintain balance; violators will be severely punished with no exceptions. As for air defense, facilities have been strengthened. All government offices, schools, hospitals, and other institutions have been ordered to relocate to outlying districts. Financial agencies and banks have set up offices outside the city, and several shops have closed to relocate in the suburbs. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Chungking) According to reliable sources here, residents of major cities across Sichuan Province are also actively evacuating, following official directives. In large cities, more than half the population is to be evacuated, putting a strain on rural areas, which are experiencing unprecedented traffic growth. At the same time, factories and handicraft workshops are moving from cities to the countryside, elevating the rural production role. According to police reports, while the large‑scale evacuations have filled the countryside to an unprecedented degree, order and discipline have remained excellent. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>Peking—The semi‑official Peking Gazette reports that the North China “Federal Reserve Bank,” under Japanese control, has decided to revalue its currency, the “Federal Reserve note,” changing its value from 1 shilling 2 pence to 8 pence. The aim is to reduce the disparity between the Legal Tender Yuan and the “Federal Reserve note,” promote foreign trade, and lower prices, which in many cases have doubled since before the war. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Labour MP Leslie today in the House of Commons proposed banning the export of war materials to Japan. Leslie asked the government, given its repeated declarations of a non‑aggression policy, whether it would instruct its representatives at the League of Nations Council in Geneva to advocate prohibiting gasoline and minerals necessary for continued operations in China from being shipped to or sold to Japan. Lord Whitehall replied that the Chinese government’s request had been included on the agenda of the current League of Nations Council session and would be fully discussed by the Council, though he could not predict the outcome. Leslie asked what instructions had been given to the British representative to the Council; Whitehall was unwilling to provide a binding statement, only saying that Foreign Secretary Halifax himself would attend. Leslie further asked whether the Foreign Secretary was aware of large quantities of nickel being sent from Canada to Japan and whether action should be taken now; Whitehall said he was confident the matter would be considered. He then addressed (1) Britain’s representations to Japan regarding continued Japanese air raids on civilians in Chungking and other places, and (2) Britain’s possible proposal of a long‑term non‑aggression pact with Japan. He said that with regard to the bombing of civilians, the British government had already made serious representations, and the League had passed resolutions, so Halifax saw no need for further action. As to a separate long‑term non‑aggression pact between Britain and Japan, both were signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty and therefore no new framework was necessary. Conservative MP Marston asked about the Japanese order requiring North China exporters to sell foreign exchange at 1 shilling 2 pence to purchase Federal Reserve notes, and whether the government had protested to Japan and received a reply, as foreign trade in Tianjin was still seriously affected by this decree. Whitehall replied that the Japanese government’s response stated briefly that Federal Reserve notes were the only legal currency in North China. To ensure their full function in commerce, the authorities had compelled North China exporters to redeem Federal Reserve notes. They did not intend to control general commerce or foreign exchange in North China. If Britain followed this procedure, no difficulty would arise, and there would be no question of treaty rights. The North China Provisional Government had full sovereignty over trade, so this measure did not conflict with Japan’s assurances of respect for third‑party rights. The British government found this Japanese reply unsatisfactory and was considering making further serious representations. The Japanese measure continued to severely affect foreign trade in Tianjin.

<p>(London) On the organization of an anti‑aggression bloc, the government’s diplomatic adviser twice met today with Soviet Ambassador Maisky to explain the British government’s views. Ambassador Maisky immediately reported by long‑distance telephone to the Soviet government. According to Balkan sources here, these talks may not bear fruit, as the Soviet Union is not satisfied with Britain’s new proposal and still insists on its plan presented on the 15th, calling for a formal mutual assistance pact among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This is the Soviet Union’s minimum requirement, not its maximum. The Soviet government would be willing to accept the French compromise formula for the three powers, which provides that if any one country comes under threat while fulfilling League obligations, the other two will assist it. Whether Moscow will accept this remains in doubt. In short, unless a formal mutual assistance pact is signed among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Soviets are prepared to refuse cooperation. This position remains unchanged.

(Havas, 17th) Balkan insiders here also report that while Britain and the Soviet Union are negotiating collective security, the Soviet Union and Turkey have secretly concluded an agreement with broad terms, stipulating: (1) In the event of any aggression that could threaten the status quo in the Balkans, the Soviet Union and Turkey will jointly counter it; (2) in the event of war, both countries will coordinate all resources and forces for mutual defense. The two armies will be under unified command of Turkish generals; the two air forces under unified command of Soviet officers. The Soviet navy will defend the safety of the Black Sea, while the Turkish navy, together with the British and Greek navies, will defend the eastern Mediterranean. Moreover, if necessary, both countries will redeploy their Caucasus defense forces to the Black Sea coast for rapid transport to the Balkans. The Soviet government also demands that foreign warships wishing to pass through the Dardanelles and Bosporus be restricted; in short, except for those already bound by non‑aggression pacts with the Soviet Union, no foreign warships will be allowed through the straits. It is said that the Arab states have all expressed agreement with this Soviet‑Turkish pact. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Italy’s ambassador to Japan, Volitti, this afternoon called on Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Details of their conversation have not been disclosed. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today the English‑language Guangzhi Daily published a special essay titled “Japan Considers Its Policy,” offering a detailed review of meetings on Japan’s policy toward the European situation. It states that this issue has been discussed repeatedly at meetings of five ministers, the Cabinet Councillors’ conference, and by the leaders of the navy and army, and remains a principal topic among government figures. Various signals now suggest that a decision may soon be reached. Discussions on strengthening anti‑Communist defenses began during the last Diet session, when some Lower House members requested that the government clarify its intended course of action. Thereafter, the matter has been scheduled for discussion in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo. Here it is regarded as a pressing problem Prime Minister Hiranuma must address, and not an easy one, since he must reconcile many divergent viewpoints: on the one hand, those of Japanese government personnel, and on the other, the interests of both Germany and Italy. The newspaper adds that this responsibility requires great adaptability. Japan has thus far followed a path of compromise and may propose a new best solution to break free of this difficult situation. Former Prime Minister Konoe once identified himself as a proponent of compromise, lending credibility to the view that Prime Minister Hiranuma possesses the qualities of a mediator—an attribute essential for a successful premier. This defensive strategy, adopted in times of crisis when various domestic sentiments must be balanced, deserves commendation. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Official sources here recently announced that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to arrive in Berlin before the 20th of this month and formally sign the German‑Italian political and military pact with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the morning of the 22nd, after which he will hold further talks with German government officials.

The pact will remain in force for ten years, after which it will be reviewed. It is said that, even if only one of the two countries is drawn into armed conflict, both will hold military consultations and undertake joint military and political actions. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>Danzig—The express train from Warsaw to Gdynia derailed outside Danzig station early today. Several cars overturned and the locomotive was destroyed by fire. The cause remains inscrutable.

<p>Warsaw—Germany today has registered Poles living in Germany as Germans, provoking great indignation here. It is said that over one million Poles have been erased by this statistical method, and there are fears that, under various pressures, only a few hundred thousand Polish residents in Germany will declare themselves Polish in official records. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) At this afternoon’s session of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chamberlain replied in writing to Labour MP Mr. Fleumer, stating that Britain’s current policy aims to encourage Germany and Poland to establish good relations and, whenever possible, to facilitate a satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues, but that any definitive action must have the agreement of both parties concerned. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that 35,000 members of the Nazi Party’s Storm Troopers and the Stahlhelm defense organization have already arrived in the Free City of Danzig, and that ballots for the city’s plebiscite have been printed. These signs may be viewed as indications of imminent German action regarding Danzig. However, diplomatic circles here believe Germany may not risk anything reckless: any violent move against the Free City would almost certainly trigger a German‑Polish war, drawing Britain and France to Poland’s aid. Germany is said to understand this and will act with caution, especially after the signing of the German‑Italian political and military pact: since Italy would be obliged to assist Germany in any war, it would have the right to influence German policy in advance. Prime Minister Mussolini is reportedly exerting every effort to prevent Germany from taking any irrevocable action. The diplomatic situation remains confused, and the stances of various countries are still wavering. Germany’s current endeavor appears to be to secure the alignment of as many nations as possible.

<h3 id="e25">Palestine Question: Britain Publishes Compromise Plan; Independent State Within Ten Years; Jews Rise in Opposition <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(London) The government published a White Paper this afternoon on the Palestine question, stating that January’s round‑table conference, aimed at finding a solution, has failed. As the mandatory power, Britain has four responsibilities: (1) to protect Palestine’s holy places; (2) to create a political, administrative, and economic environment making Palestine a national home for the Jewish people and facilitating Jewish immigration; (3) to safeguard civil rights and religious freedoms of all inhabitants; and (4) to foster development of self‑governing institutions. The government says a clear definition of its policy and objectives would greatly benefit peace and welfare in Palestine. The policy is explained in three parts: constitutional framework, immigration policy, and land policy.</p>
<p>(a) Constitutional framework: The goal of the mandate is not to convert Palestine into a Jewish state in a way that would conflict with the wishes of the Arab inhabitants. Britain has no intention of suppressing Arabic language or culture or subordinating them to Jewish cultural dominance. It solemnly declares that making Palestine a Jewish state is not part of British policy and would contradict its obligations to the Arabs. It regrets that Sir Henry McMahon’s 1916 declaration was misunderstood as promising an Arab state. In short, Britain’s objectives are fivefold: (1) to establish, within ten years, an independent Palestine that will enter into treaties with Britain, satisfying mutual commercial and strategic needs; (2) to ensure Arab and Jewish communities share executive authority to protect each community’s vital interests; (3) during the transition, Britain will retain governing responsibility while gradually allowing both communities to participate; (4) once order is restored, administrative bodies will be staffed by Arabs and Jews proportionate to their populations and will gradually be led by members of both communities; and (5) after that stage, the administrative committee may become a cabinet, and residents may later establish a legislative council.</p>
<p>(b) Immigration policy: Unrestricted Jewish immigration would conflict with Arab wishes, while a total ban would be unfair. A compromise is proposed: Jewish immigration will be limited to 75,000 over the next five years, raising the Jewish population to one‑third of the Arab population. After five years, further Jewish immigration will require Arab consent.</p>
<p>(c) Land policy: Sales of land in Palestine to Jews should be limited. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Today the Jewish Agency issued a statement on the White Paper, calling the new policy a betrayal of the Jewish people’s right to rebuild their nation in their ancestral homeland. It says the policy transfers power to the Arab majority, reduces Jews to subjects in their own land, and confines them to a local Jewish area. Jews regard this as a breach of faith and capitulation to Arab terrorism, which has deepened the rift between Jews and Arabs. They will not passively accept a policy enforced by force; today is one of the darkest days in Jewish history. Britain seeks to deprive Jews of their last hope and cruelly cut off their path home, but it cannot subdue the Jewish people. Meanwhile, Arab leaders in London have also expressed strong dissatisfaction with the proposed “transitional period” before joint Arab‑Jewish administration in an independent Palestine.

<p>Quebec—From early morning until late at night today, tens of thousands of people cheered the King and Queen of England. At 3 pm, 30,000 schoolchildren on Abraham Plain sang “God Save the King” and “Canada” to welcome Their Majesties. Soon after, the King and Queen issued a written message thanking Canadians and Americans for their letters and telegrams of welcome and goodwill, expressing gratitude and regretting they could not reply individually. Tonight Government House hosted a grand banquet in honor of the King and Queen. Prime Minister King spoke of the honor it is for the sovereign of the Empire to visit this land, noting that today the monarchy has become the center of national life in a way never before seen. Their Majesties, traveling from the Old World to the New, are like joining one family from another. The King responded with thanks. Senator and government party leader Dandurand delivered an address in French, recalling Quebec’s founding in 1608 by Champlain and welcoming the King in Champlain’s language in the capital of “New France.” The King also replied in French, praising Champlain’s bringing of civilization to both banks of the Saint Lawrence River and celebrating the harmonious coexistence of two great peoples today. He lauded Quebec’s spirit of hard work and preservation of ancient traditions as a fusion forming Canada, embodying the ideal of federation to endure forever. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>(London) At this afternoon’s House of Commons session, Labour MP Mr. Earle asked the First Lord of the Admiralty how many Japanese capital ships were armed with guns of 14 inches or greater, and whether the Admiralty had information on this. Parliamentary Secretary Mr. Shakespeare replied that, to the Admiralty’s knowledge, Japan built only two such capital ships before the signing of the 1930 London Naval Treaty. Mr. Earle then asked whether the Japanese government had since ceased building such warships. Mr. Shakespeare answered that the government had received no credible reports on the matter.

<h3 id="e30">Japanese Forces from Huai–Lianfu Invading Fenggu Village Suffer Crushing Defeat; Ambushed Twice by Chinese Army; Over 600 Troops Involved, Nearly Half Killed <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(From Huaian) Japanese forces from Lianfu in the two Huai regions advanced on Chinese positions at Donggou and Yilin. The Chinese, having devised a plan, lured them into the area around Fenggu Village and inflicted a crushing defeat. The details are as follows: About 600 Japanese troops, with seven or eight artillery pieces, converged from the two regions and reached the Chenjiazhi Banhhu area on the evening of the 5th, then attacked the Chinese positions at Donggou and Yilin. Upon learning this, the Chinese command ordered the garrisons at those towns to hold fast and block the advance while dispatching an elite force to ambush the Japanese around Fenggu Village and the nearby Qinggou Town to the southwest. With rear defenses secure, the units at Donggou and Yilin fought fiercely for two or three nights, killing forty to fifty Japanese and buying time for the ambush forces to take their positions. Since holding those towns was no longer necessary, the Chinese made one final fierce stand and then withdrew quietly.</p>
<p>Setting the Final Ambush in the Suburbs</p>
<p>The civilian population had been evacuated in advance. After the Chinese withdrew overnight, the Japanese only discovered it at dawn but dared not proceed hastily. Only after deploying traitorous interpreters and scouts did they resume their attack. As intended, they rushed into Fenggu Village, where the Chinese held back until the entire Japanese force was inside. Ambush units, spread across fields and hills, then encircled and fell upon them.</p>
<p>Encirclement and Furious Assault</p>
<p>Japanese troops inside the village, stripping off their gear to rest and forage, scrambled in disarray and failed to coordinate. The Chinese tightened the ring, and amid cries of slaughter, repeatedly repelled desperate Japanese breakout attempts. The ambush killed 170 to 180 Japanese. The remnants stampeded, some fleeing through Yangjiazhi near Qinggou (southwest of Fenggu Village), another pre‑set ambush area, where dozens more were killed. In total, of the roughly 600 invading soldiers, only about 300 remained. The casualties were unprecedented in recent battles, marking one of the largest annihilations in northern Jiangsu. The remnants fled chaotically back toward Lianfu’s Banhhu. Having secured Qinggou, Fenggu Village, Yangjiazhi, Yilin, and Donggou, the Chinese are pursuing the remnants toward Banhhu, having killed over 200 more, captured dozens of rifles, and seized countless supplies. Deputy Commander‑in‑Chief Han has ordered commendations for the officers and soldiers who distinguished themselves in the operation.</p>

<p>(Suzhou) At Xietang, outside Fengmen, where canals from Jinji and Dusu converge, a puppet police unit under Xiao Long was stationed. On the night of the 15th, half a mile north of town, a small detachment of puppet police billeted in a house owned by a man named Xu was suddenly attacked by the mobile unit. Overwhelmed, they called for reinforcements. A fierce battle ensued, with the mobile unit continuously reinforced from Weiting and armed with light machine guns, persisting until dawn. The mobile unit even broke into the town before withdrawing in good order. Both sides suffered casualties; bloodstains were found in nearby wheat fields. Puppet police, twice repelled, were on high alert but did not discover the source of the opening attack. Innocent Chinese, forced to wear Japanese uniforms as guides, were later found killed and hastily buried.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Chinese Forces Besiege Huaiyin; Advance on West Gate, Attempt to Scale Walls; County Government Offices Dismantled <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(From Huaiyin) Chinese counteroffensive troops briefly reached the city walls. On the night of the 7th, County Magistrate Wang of Siyang arrived near Chenji, and on the 9th, Magistrate Lu reached Wangjiab Bridge. A certain brigade, diverted west to reinforce Xuyi on an urgent call, also moved to Wang Bridge on the 11th. On the night of the 13th, they attacked Huaiyin: Siyang’s standing brigade advanced to Hancheng Township, and another unit together with the Huaiyin standing brigade reached Longzhuoleng. However, time was short and, with dawn approaching, they could not fully exert their strength. On the night of the 14th, they renewed the attack: the Siyang standing brigade reached Hongmen and attacked the West Gate, but the Japanese had already filled the gate passage with earth and repelled them. One Chinese regiment advanced to Shilichang Street, East Gate Huajie, and South Gate Xiaojie, selecting spots to scale the walls, but Japanese had dug the moat six to seven feet deep, making it impassable, and sentries shone searchlights at the gates, thwarting the attempt. The Chinese then swept the defenders with machine-gun fire and bombarded the city with artillery, forcing the Japanese to retreat within the walls. The Chinese captured four puppet self‑defense sentries at East Gate Huajie at dawn; by morning all units had returned to their original positions. Troops remain deployed around Huaiyin, closely watching the Japanese inside. They have also mobilized civilians to destroy bridges on the Qingshu, Qinghuai, and Qingsu roads to hinder Japanese movements. They await another opportunity to renew the siege.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that during the Chinese counterattack on Huaiyin, a Japanese reinforcement detachment was withdrawn north due to tensions at Xuzhou, and tanks were also redeployed. Currently only 400 Japanese remain in Huaiyin, with a few holding outposts in four surrounding villages—most notably the camp at Wangying. The Huaiyin County Government and seven district commissioner offices were dismantled by the Japanese; building materials and looted goods from shops and residences were loaded onto sixty to seventy civilian vessels and taken north.</p>
<p>Since Huaiyin’s fall two months ago, the occupying force of over 300—mostly Korean and Manchurian puppet troops—has been notorious for indiscipline. Upon arrival, they frequently roamed villages two to three miles outside the city, committing rape, plunder, and arson while foraging. Later, widespread guerrilla ambushes in the surrounding villages deterred them from venturing out; they remained shut inside the city, setting up barbed wire along major roads. Residents inside live in dire conditions. The puppet Maintenance Association is chaired by Zheng Dazi, vice‑chaired by Li Yushu, with general affairs, education, public security, and finance departments, and subcommittees in city wards and towns led by gangs of miscreants holding puppet posts. There is also a procurement office run by Director Huang Zihou, supplying goods and food to the Japanese. These collaborators, treating their occupiers as patrons, live under strict Japanese surveillance and cannot move freely. The Japanese command is headquartered in the county government building, the military police are housed in the elementary school annex, the propaganda and pacification unit operates a Farmers’ Bank, and a brothel for Japanese soldiers has been established in a southern alley of the city.</p>

<p>Two Japanese Motorboats Also Sunk</p>
<p>Pinghu, local dispatch—More than 300 Japanese troops, imagining they could sweep the Chinese forces in the nearby suburbs, arrived at Pinghu County Town two days ago. For guides, they forcibly recruited vegetable vendors. After setting out, they had only advanced to a place called Xujia Embankment, several li from the city, when they were suddenly surrounded by Zhang Ziming’s Chinese unit and decisively attacked. On the spot, they sank two Japanese motorboats, killed thirty-eight Japanese soldiers, seized more than sixty rifles and pistols, and captured over ten Japanese soldiers alive. Among the captives was one Man Yeh Jin-an-tsin, who confessed he was twenty-four years old, from Tokyo, serving as a private first class in the Tanaka Unit. Its headquarters was in Songjiang under Commander Tanaka Yoshio. Last year, he was sent from Tokyo to Fengjing first. He is an only son, with an elderly mother and a beautiful wife, press–ganged into the army by the warlords; he had no choice. At the time of interrogation, he wept bitterly, his condition deeply sorrowful. This routed Japanese detachment had four motorboats in total.</p>

<p>Western Bridge and Tracks Destroyed</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Await Reinforcements in the Town</p>
<p>Jiashan, local dispatch—Chinese forces that crossed from Zhejiang’s eastern sea by landing at Jinshanwei are now being fully deployed. At Xiashi Wangdian section, the tracks have been wrecked. The first passenger train from Hangzhou to Shanghai derailed and plunged into the river. On the western outskirts of Jiashan, the 63–64 numbered foreign bridge was blown in two, and thirteen rails outside the East Gate were removed. Along the line, the Japanese railway guard squads frequently suffer ambushes, so the trains on the Hangzhou–Shanghai line are often held up. On the western outskirts near the West Gate of Jiashan, two days ago a Chinese regiment passed through with forty-three civilian boats fully loaded with troops. On Anqiao Bridge, they mounted artillery aimed directly at the town. In a Japanese lookout post, seventeen men were slaughtered; the puppet police substation was burned down. Inside the town, the Japanese garrison has only about twenty men. They no longer check identification certificates, letting civilians come and go freely, but they order residents from door to door not to shut their doors at night and forbid women from going upstairs to shelter. The purpose of these orders is unknown. Although the Japanese repeatedly appealed to the Hangzhou–Shanghai garrison for help, only about three hundred men, mostly speaking a Northeastern accent, have been dispatched to nearby suburbs. In Fengjing, Japanese troops, earlier probed by Chinese forces at the East Gate, engaged in fierce fighting for three hours with casualties on both sides. Now they hold the four gates firmly; town residents are forbidden to step outside the gates, allowed only to move freely within. Travel permits have been suspended and all boats from the four neighboring towns are cut off.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Residents of Jiading, Taicang, and Other Counties Oppose Reorganization into the Puppet Municipality—Seven Counties Too Vast to Combine as One <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality, the old territory of Baoshan was reassigned to the municipality. However, the two prefectures of Shanghai and Baoshan remained under the Jiangsu Provincial Government and never experienced an administrative interval. Since last winter, the puppet mayor Chuan Xiao’an has taken office, and finding no revenue, sought to annex the six counties of Jiading, Fengxian, Chongming, Baoshan, Chuansha, and Fengxian—more recently adding Taicang—seven counties in total—to his jurisdiction, advancing his scheme of annexation. This has provoked the strong opposition of the people of the seven counties—led by Wang Chongfu, Li Weiji, Wu Shouying, and others—who argue that although these counties are directly or indirectly contiguous to Shanghai, their land quality varies in fertility, their industries differ in scale, and all are agricultural areas with underdeveloped commerce. Moreover, Nanhui and Fengxian lie on the east bank of the Huangpu River, about a hundred miles from Shanghai; Chuansha and Jiading are sixty or seventy miles away; Chongming is marooned offshore, requiring a five- or six-hour boat ride. Such vast distances cannot be administratively merged into one. Administrative boundaries have never followed military zones that shift with troop movements; if administrative divisions were changed constantly, organizational confusion and operational disruption would ensue. After the war, Shanghai will be especially devastated. Although the seven counties have also suffered wartime destruction, it is lighter than in Shanghai proper. Mayor Chuan Xiao’an’s intention to annex them is purely to seize their resources, throwing their people into ruin. Recently the puppet municipal government sent a so-called division chief, Jiang, to the seven counties to survey them for takeover. The outcome is unknown.</p>

<p>Japanese Fortifications Destroyed</p>
<p>Jiayu, local dispatch—On the evening of the sixteenth, Chinese forces captured the town of Qixing Bridge in Jiayu County. Riding the victorious momentum, they then attacked the Japanese railway protection garrison at the station, engaging in fierce battle. The result: the Japanese forces retreated in rout, suffering eight fatalities. After recapturing the station, fearing Japanese encirclement, the Chinese troops demolished all Japanese fortifications and then withdrew.</p>

<p>The Japanese and puppet troops in Pudong, based at Zhoupu and Xinchang, have been reinforced and supplied for several days, with large formations intending to advance southward. When the leader of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, Colonel He Jian, learned of this, he led the Eighth Detachment of his brigade to attack at dawn on the sixth, recapturing Shen Village, Su Family Bridge, and Chenxing. They seized two light machine guns, fifty-three rifles, six submachine guns, numerous pistols and other military supplies, and killed over a hundred Japanese soldiers. At the same time, they mobilized local militiamen to destroy sections of the Zhoupu–Xinchang road for several li. By daybreak, having achieved their objective of annihilation, the Loyal and Righteous Army withdrew.</p>

<p>The West Green Handball Singles Final was held yesterday at 6 p.m. in the West Green court, contested between Chinese player He Shuoqing and Qu Keling, refereed by Blat. After two hours of exceptionally thrilling play, He Qinggong unfortunately lost one set to two. Yesterday, despite the lopsided appearance of the match—He winning the first set—he could not sustain his strength and dropped the next two. Qu Keling’s advantage lay chiefly in physical strength; in skill, He was superior. This defeat is most regrettable. In the opening set, contact was made at He’s eye corner, but after a brief rest he continued despite the injury, eventually dominating with a 21–3 victory. In the deciding set, he led 7–2, but Qu Keling gradually equalized. In the final set, both exerted their utmost, but He’s stamina fell short; though he took an early lead, his shots lacked power and he suffered fierce counters, ultimately losing 16–21 and the match 1–2. Qu Keling thus retains the singles championship; results as follows:</p>

<p>The Philippine representatives for the Davis Cup, Sanches and Anthony, departed Manila for Shanghai the day before yesterday (17th), set to perform here this Sunday. Philippine tennis’s first appearance in the Davis Cup in eleven years; this is the third Cup. They will compete in the North American Zone, facing winners from Australia and Mexico in the second week. Sanches is a 20-year-old university student, 5’4”, the Philippine champion for two consecutive years, recently winning the national and Manila singles titles. Last year he reached the semifinals of the Saigon International. His play is exceptionally calm, with sure groundstrokes—truly a rare talent. His entire family excels in tennis; his father represented the Philippines at the 1929 Far Eastern Games, competing against China and Japan, earning Sanches the moniker “son of a tennis dynasty.” Anthony, only 18 and still in secondary school, 5’2”, is the nation’s second-ranked player. Yugoslav Davis Cup player Kojošebeck fell victim to his play in Manila last November. His strokes are slow, high and soft, landing sharply in both corners—typical “sticky toffee” style, difficult to defeat. His father, also a tennis star and national champion, was selected for the Philippine team at the 1930 Far Eastern Games in Tokyo.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Overview of Education for Overseas Chinese—Over 2,400 Overseas Chinese Schools; 200,000 Yuan Annual Central Subsidy <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing special report) Before 1928, overseas Chinese education was managed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission’s Chinese Education Committee. When that committee stalled, the former Academia Sinica took charge. Abroad, there was no direct local administrative body for overseas Chinese education. In 1929, the Ministry of Education issued regulations for consuls and commercial counselors to manage overseas Chinese education. In 1930 the Ministry assigned overseas education to its Department of General Affairs and established a Chinese Education Planning Committee for design and recommendations. After the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission reorganized and formed an Overseas Chinese Education Office, that office took charge of administrative affairs, with the Ministry of Education in a supervisory role. The Planning Committee effectively paused, and consular involvement did not meet expectations. To date, overseas Chinese education administration has yet to be properly adjusted. It requires special attention going forward. The history of overseas Chinese education administration is summarized below:</p>
<p>Legal Framework</p>
<p>In 1930, the Ministry of Education promulgated regulations for overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools, stipulating school funding, facilities, curriculum, discipline, school boards, staff, students, and associations as guidelines for school management. It also issued regulations on school board organization, school registration, and policies for overseas Chinese returning to study domestically, completing the key legal framework. After the reorganization of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, both parties jointly revised all regulations, changing “overseas Chinese” to “overseas nationals” and marking them as amended, but largely retaining their original content.</p>
<p>School Registration</p>
<p>In the past ten years, the number of overseas Chinese schools registered with the government has increased annually. Currently there are forty-eight secondary schools, 360 primary schools, and over 2,400 unregistered schools. Registered schools constitute less than one fifth. The main reasons: obstruction by colonial governments in various countries and a lack of local administrators to supervise, resulting in low registration enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Financial Subsidies</p>
<p>Since the Commission’s reorganization, the central government has allocated 200,000 yuan annually for overseas Chinese education subsidies. Registered schools with insufficient funds and financially disadvantaged but academically excellent students returning to domestic study receive support. Each allocation is decided by meetings convened by the Commission, with Ministry of Education representatives in attendance. Currently these funds are disbursed at 70 percent of the approved amounts.</p>
<p>Inspections</p>
<p>In 1936, the Commission and the Ministry jointly dispatched personnel to inspect overseas Chinese education in various ports in Southeast Asia and in British and American territories, with overall satisfactory results. Other projects, such as training teacher cadres and preparing for a Chinese Education Congress, remain active tasks led by the Commission.</p>

<p>Speech by Mr. Shen Guanglie to Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Students’ Advancement and Career Guidance Class</p>
<p>Four Paths to Employment</p>
<p>Having just left school, where do we look for jobs? Sitting at home behind closed doors, obviously “work cannot fall from the sky” unless someone finds a job for you. Thus, job seeking must rely on action. Broadly there are four ways:</p>
<p>1. Public Agencies Registration</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are three public registration offices: (1) the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Bureau under the China Vocational Education Society; (2) the Young Men’s Association Placement Department; and (3) the Worldwide Chinese Students Association Placement Office. On the mainland, there is also the National Academic Work Consultation Office; the Ministry of Education now also has a special office for this purpose, though limited to specialized personnel. These offices serve society free of charge. Procedures and recommendations are as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Fill out the form—essential for job registration, allowing assessment of your resume and status as the basis for job placement. Be meticulous; the form is the first impression and matters greatly. If your contact information changes, notify immediately to avoid invalidation.</p>
<p>(b) Interview—demonstrate your specialties or focus areas (e.g., mathematics, literature, accounting, typing). Do not say vaguely you can do “anything,” since employers have specific needs. Those hardest to place are generalists.</p>
<p>(c) Follow-up—after a suitable period, politely inquire about opportunities. When introduced, do not hesitate over compensation. Adopt an experimental attitude and pursue contact.</p>
<p>2. Recommendations from Friends and Relatives</p>
<p>Two methods:</p>
<p>(a) Correspondence—ensure neat handwriting and concise, appropriate wording. Avoid long-winded letters. Enclose your resume with each letter, detailed enough for the recipient’s review.</p>
<p>(b) In-Person Meeting—dress neatly and maintain humble yet confident demeanor. Come prepared to seek work as a proper activity; do not be shy. Focus on the other’s needs and what you can offer. When the conversation has progressed sufficiently, stand up to signal departure.</p>
<p>(c) Follow-up inquiry—after some time, check in again. Vary your approach with discussions of personnel matters, current events, or news to avoid awkwardness.</p>
<p>3. Proactive Inquiries</p>
<p>Through personal observation or hearsay that there is demand somewhere, do not hesitate to investigate. Classified ads in newspapers, though not always reliable, can also expand your experience. Success is gratifying; failure is no disgrace—keep trying, and success will come.</p>
<p>4. Self-Employed Initiatives</p>
<p>Being self-employed or starting a partnership to maintain a living, such as opening a small shop—an example. Avoid vanity and class prejudice; be ready to “roll up your sleeves.” I recall a former county superintendent selling rice dumplings in a restaurant, earning a thriving income, or a youth shining shoes who also earned over forty yuan a month, covering living expenses and remitting home support while still training himself—truly admirable real-life examples.</p>
<p>Once Employed, Work Diligently</p>
<p>After obtaining a job, be content with your compensation, always recalling the hardship of unemployment and that many are worse off than you. Maintain equanimity. If you can work hard, you will earn superiors’ trust and increase your pay. Outside work, attend supplementary schools to gain practical knowledge. If circumstances prevent that, self-study in related disciplines. Value on-the-job experience and never neglect it.</p>
<p>If Unemployed, Be Patient</p>
<p>If temporarily without suitable work, do not despair. In life, disappointments outnumber successes. As long as you are determined to improve, opportunities will not pass you by—like a long voyage cannot enjoy a favorable wind every day. Persist through adverse conditions; fair weather will come. The more difficulties you face, the closer you are to success. History is full of such examples everywhere. Cherish your efforts. As for the principles of employment, time constraints require we discuss them another time.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways’ Department of Educational Affairs has decided to increase the current year’s public and private school subsidy budget by 220,000 yuan. A special commissioner investigated each school’s operations and academic performance to determine subsidy amounts. The investigation is complete, and the distribution has been decided; funds will be issued shortly. This year, 338 Chinese private schools will receive subsidies.</p>

<p>In Fudan’s Department of Education, following the departure of Department Chair Zhang Yi to become Director-General of the Ministry of Education’s General Affairs Department, President Li has appointed Qian Weizong to succeed him. Professors Chen Kemei, Wei Yin, Jiang Zaihua, and He Qingru teach in the department. This semester, Dr. He Qingru has been invited by Harvard University to lecture on vocational guidance in the U.S. and left at the beginning of March. Since his appointment, Qian has encouraged students to pursue scholarly research diligently. This semester the university library has acquired many educational reference books and subscribed to four Western education journals for student reading. The psychology laboratory apparatus, partly relocated to the Chongqing campus, has been supplemented with new purchases. Qian has invited educational experts to lecture, stimulating research interest. Last Saturday, Deputy Director Chen Xuanshan of the Ministry’s Division of Chinese Education lectured on “The Role of Experimental Methods in Education,” analyzing conditions, limitations, and common errors in experimentation in detail. Regular educational lecture and debate meetings have been held to enhance students’ oral presentation skills. Recently a competition on secondary education and educational administration was held; Qian personally funded forty yuan to purchase books as prizes for outstanding students. To verify what they learn, students under faculty guidance have visited the municipal girls’ school, Detong Academy, American School, Gongxue, and Chinese-Western Girls’ School. Before the war, the department published a journal well received externally; wartime disruptions have halted it, but it is planned for revival when possible.</p>

<p>According to the English-language American Evening Post, following the Gulangyu incident and the ensuing rumors in Shanghai, the British and American troops stationed here have been closely monitoring the situation. Over the next few days, they will continue to do so. The U.S. Naval Marine Corps will not be permitted to leave their camp tomorrow (the 19th). The White Russian unit in the French concession has also been ordered to stand ready. The British destroyer Koae has departed Hong Kong bound for Shanghai to bolster defenses. It is possible that the British ambassador will travel on that ship, though no official announcement has been made. The Municipal Council’s Police Department has indeed heightened its vigilance to strengthen general control and maintain good order. In particular, the Special Constabulary and certain units of the International Merchants’ Association have recorded members’ addresses and telephone numbers, indicating that necessary precautions have been taken over the past two days.</p>
<p>French Concession Recruits White Russian Volunteers</p>
<p>The French concession authorities here recently undertook the recruitment of seventy White Russian volunteers, to be named the “White Russian Auxiliary Battalion.” Officers will be selected from the senior White Russian unit in the concession, which currently numbers around three hundred men trained by French officers. On April 1st they celebrated their seventh anniversary. Upon enlistment, each volunteer will receive a monthly salary of forty‑five yuan, increasing annually; corporals and sergeants will earn over one hundred yuan per month. Uniforms and lodging are all provided by the concession authorities.</p>
<p>Public Concession Inspects Hotels</p>
<p>At 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday, personnel from the Municipal Council’s Police Department, accompanied by members of the Russian Merchants’ Association, proceeded to the Grand Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road and the Anton Hotel on Hubei Road, conducting room‑to‑room searches. It was said they were seeking terrorists, but nothing was found in either establishment. The search was completed by 10 o’clock.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Hongkou Openly Distributes Anti‑British Leaflets; Children Paraded on Trucks Led by a Brass Band <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>According to the Zhilin Daily, just after 2 p.m. yesterday (the 17th), four trucks slowly drove along Disway Road in Hongkou. The first truck carried a brass band playing marches; the next two carried Chinese children not yet of school age; the last carried a detachment of Japanese soldiers as guards. They distributed anti‑British leaflets to passersby. Drawn by the music, many Chinese came forward to pick up the leaflets and read them. On duty in that area were Chinese and foreign officers of the Municipal Council’s Police Department, who collected a large number of leaflets. As the four trucks proceeded along Disway Road, they attracted considerable attention. The children on board threw leaflets to left and right, causing laughter. The content was vehemently anti‑British, urging the Chinese people to rise up against the British presence in China, overthrow the imperialism that has allegedly exploited China for years, and refrain from depositing money in British banks. However, most readers were laborers, making the action of dubious necessity. Another leaflet bore an illustration depicting the suffering of the Chinese people under British rule during feudal times. The procession continued along Disway Road, followed by a large crowd, until the leaflets were exhausted. It was reported that the children then proceeded to a reception where they had been used to distribute these anti‑British materials to Hongkou’s Chinese residents. Police personnel soon collected all the leaflets from the street, took them to the Hongkou police station, and forwarded them to the Central Police Station for translation.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Bogus “Mayor” Fu Xiaoan Again Sends Letters to Concession Authorities; Reiterates Five March Demands; Concessions’ Silence Regretted <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>According to the Zhilin Daily, Shanghai’s self‑styled “Mayor” Fu Xiaoan last night (the 17th) instructed his secretary to deliver letters to Municipal Council Chief Director Franks, Consular Corps Leader Nilon, and French Consul General Baudé. He demanded an early reply to his March 10 note regarding implementation of measures to control terrorism, and expressed hope that the Public and French concession authorities would cooperate with the “Shanghai Municipal Government” to maintain peace and order.</p>
<p>Five Demands</p>
<p>In Fu’s letter to Chief Director Franks and Consular Corps Leader Nilon, he recounted the five demands from his March note: (1) implementation of measures to control terrorist crimes; (2) restoration of the Daxi Road police substation; (3) transfer of jurisdiction over the Special Court; (4) return of land bureau records; (5) prohibition on flying the Kuomintang flag.</p>
<p>No Reply Received</p>
<p>The letter noted that on March 28 Fu had written to the concession authorities to draw attention to these matters but received no reply. On March 23 he met with Municipal Council President Fei Xundun, who promised sincere consideration of roads outside the West Boundary, yet no action followed. In yesterday’s letter, Fu requested Fei to communicate on these issues. The letter concluded by stating that there is now a “Special Municipal Government” in Shanghai, and hoped the Municipal Council and consular corps “for the sake of peace and order in the Public Concession and the welfare of the people” would cooperate with that “government.”</p>
<p>Deep Regret</p>
<p>In a similar letter to the French Consul General, Fu expressed deep regret over the failure of both concessions to respond to his note, and recounted his March 10 note to the consul general, requesting measures to control terrorism, transfer of the Special Court, and prohibition of the Kuomintang flag.</p>
<p>Flag‑Flying Incident</p>
<p>Fu stated that the ban on flag‑flying had been issued only once and not fully enforced, and that he saw no indication from the French authorities regarding terrorism control or court transfer. He again requested an immediate reply and hoped the French concession authorities would cooperate with the “Special Municipal Government.”</p>
<h3 id="e58">Following Advice, Fresh Pork Industry Decides to Resume Operations; Begins Weighing and Selling Existing Pigs Today; Solemnly Reaffirms Original Stance <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Since the fresh pig and meat trade was forced to halt operations several days ago, merchants have held a firm stance, awaiting the concession authorities’ resolution. During this period, incoming livestock, though few, could not be delayed, and traders appealed for relief measures to preserve their capital. Yesterday’s survey found over 1,400 live pigs in the South Market and over 600 in the North Market, totaling more than 2,000 heads—yet the two concessions normally require over 2,000 pigs per day.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Advise Resumption</p>
<p>In the French Concession Municipal Council, authorities invited representatives of the Fresh Pig Trade Association and pig merchants yesterday morning, advising them to weigh and sell pigs in stock on the 19th to ensure food supply; refusal would contravene the Council’s purpose. Similarly, the Public Concession’s Municipal Council, at its bureau meeting yesterday at 3 p.m., heard a report on the halted pork trade and advised resumption to secure food for the people.</p>
<p>Fresh Pig Trade Decides to Resume</p>
<p>At 4 p.m. yesterday, the Fresh Pig Trade Association convened all pig merchants, conveying the concession authorities’ advice. Managers stated they would uphold their original position but, out of respect for the repeated advice, agreed that on the 19th they would first weigh and sell their stock and immediately informed the fresh meat trade to do likewise. It was heard that fresh pig merchants would resume operations today, though the existing stock in the concessions will supply only one day’s sales.</p>
<p>Slaughterhouses to Resume Meat Supply Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council’s slaughterhouse, along with the Su‑Xi Slaughtering Company and the Xin‑Ninghai Slaughtering Company in the Public Concession, will resume pig slaughter today. Consequently, over 2,000 fresh meat shops and stalls citywide will have fresh meat for sale starting tomorrow (the 20th). Due to the market halt, prices have soared to over 0.8 yuan per catty. It is expected that with resumed slaughter, prices will return to normal, but with limited supply, the meat trade’s prospects remain bleak.</p>
<p>Two Slaughterhouses Previously Pressured</p>
<p>The Su‑Xi Slaughtering Company at No. 50, Lane 1050, North Chengdu Road, and the Xin‑Ninghai Slaughtering Company at No. 4, Lane 1050, North Chengdu Road, halted slaughter on the morning of the 13th. On the evening of the 16th, several Japanese arrived unannounced, forcing the plants to resume slaughter. Workers firmly refused until the Chengdu Road police station intervened. To comply with the Municipal Council’s goodwill, the companies reluctantly slaughtered. It was also reported that at noon yesterday they found an unexploded hand grenade near a wooden utility pole in front of the company; it was taken by police for examination, and whether it was meant to intimidate remains unclear.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Speculators Continue Manipulation: Rice Prices Soar Again Yesterday; Rice Market Forced to Close Early; Deadline for Owners to Register Stored Rice Extended <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the rice market, starved of spot stocks and overwhelmed by demand, saw prices suddenly surge to a high of 17.7 yuan per package. The market was forced to close early and convened a meeting urging owners to register their stored stocks and extend the registration deadline. Rice merchants met yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Details follow.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Soar Again Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>After advising merchants to adhere to price limits, strictly clamp down on black‑market trading, and reward informants, rice prices had eased and the market seemed stable. However, upon opening yesterday, buyers far outnumbered sellers, sending prices soaring to 17.7 yuan—nearly 20% above the 15 yuan cap. The cause was again speculator hoarding, leading to a dearth of spot trades. Inland supplies had increased but remained far short of surging demand, with little rice in storage to release.</p>
<p>Market Forced to Close Early</p>
<p>Noting the market upheaval and persistent black‑market deals despite strict monitoring, the Market Management Committee found enforcement impossible amid tacit agreements between buyers and sellers. Chaos ensued, forcing closure around 11 a.m. A meeting was held to urge compliance, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Registration Deadline for Stored Rice Extended</p>
<p>Since the 12th, the Rice Valuation Committee handled registration of stored rice owners, with a one‑week period originally ending at 5 p.m. yesterday. Registrations were sparse—only about 61,000 packages—due to owners’ wait‑and‑see attitude. As the deadline approached, merchants rushed to pick up forms, prompting a surge in registrations. The period has been extended by one to two days. The Committee will, after concluding registrations, report to both concession authorities for further action.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants’ Association Agrees to Identify Speculators</p>
<p>Following the Chamber of Commerce’s request to identify speculators by name for appeal to the concession authorities, and the Bean and Rice Industry Association’s call for merchants to uphold price limits and report violators, the Shanghai Rice Merchants’ Association held its 20th executive committee meeting at 5 p.m. yesterday. They discussed (1) how to urge peers not to buy above price limits to stabilize prices, and (2) how to urgently identify speculator identities, among other key issues.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Complain of Difficulties</p>
<p>Member merchants such as Nanchang Rice Store, citing difficulties in adhering to caps, sent a letter to the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, stating: “As dealers selling directly to consumers, we must have goods before meeting market demand; we cannot buy today’s needs in advance for tomorrow’s. With many rice varieties and uncertain customer preferences, stocking too much risks unsold inventory, while stocking too little broadens circulation. No rice merchant can go ten days without restocking. Now, speculators are flagrantly buying above price limits for over half a month, yet expect us to comply while refusing to purchase. This is neither reasonable nor feasible.”</p>

<p>After spring cocoons began hatching across Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the Japanese‑owned China Central Company initially planned to centrally control cocoon purchases. Faced with practical difficulties, it abandoned village‑level control and allowed independent manufacturers and surplus cocoon traders to buy freely. Now, in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and Hang County areas, spring cocoons have arrived in the market since yesterday. Although some dealers have suspended advances and insurance companies have stopped insuring cocoons, merchants still set up scales to buy. However, the number of active scales is far below pre‑war levels. In Wuxi, Changzhou, and other areas, cocoons will only reach the market around the end of the month.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Times, in the Public Concession a casino was to be set up at No. 448 Higer Road. The Police Department ordered removal of obstructions in front of the house by April 9. Within a day or two, barriers blocking the two road entrances were removed, and the patrol officers stationed there withdrew, though fences and barbed wire remain. The Department’s decision follows the house owner’s written guarantee that no casino or dance hall will be opened on the premises. However, the Department wishes to see compliance before removing all nearby obstructions. Located behind Hong’en Hospital, the property underwent major renovations a month ago, and rumors of a planned gambling den prompted police action.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily, on the 17th at around 10:30 p.m., two plainclothes Japanese, accompanied by French Concession police, visited the Youth Association on Mintiyin Road and requested entry to Room 36. Association staff replied that no such room exists, as all rooms are numbered above 100. The search party did not specify what they sought and then cited other room numbers for entry. The association permitted access; they recorded the occupants’ names, then went downstairs and finally requested entry to the quarters of the association’s U.S. staff officer, Oliver, but were refused. Oliver has since left Shanghai.</p>

<p>Ordered to Suspend Publication</p>
<p>Our city’s Wen Hui Daily, Translation Daily, and other English‑backed Chinese newspapers, for publishing the telegraphed speech of Chairman Chiang of the Chongqing Production and Construction Council without completing required submission procedures, were yesterday notified by the British Consular Office that, per the British ambassador, these papers are suspended for two weeks starting immediately.</p>
<p>Licenses Revoked</p>
<p>The Municipal Council’s Intelligence Department announced that yesterday afternoon, the Council revoked the registration certificates of two Chinese newspapers—the American Daily and the Sino‑American Daily. The Council solemnly stated that the revocation was not due to publication of General Chiang Kai‑shek’s speech summary, nor failure to submit political speeches for special review as requested by the police chief. The real reason was that certain phrases in the published speeches were deemed incompatible with maintaining legal order within the Public Concession.</p>

<p>On the 12th of this month, the Municipal Council Health Committee held its inaugural meeting of this term, electing Commissioner He Lai as chairman. Among the proposals discussed were:</p>
<p>(1) Leasing the Hongkou Open‑Air Swimming Pool</p>
<p>The Health Department received several applications to lease the Hongkou pool. The pool and filtration system require repairs estimated at 7,000 yuan. A majority of the committee favored leasing by tender to avoid indefinite closure. Bidders of any nationality may participate; the highest bidder wins. It was decided to recommend the board require the lessee to deposit 7,000 yuan in cash to cover repairs, refundable once the pool reopens to the public. During the lease, the lessee bears repair responsibility. The board retains discretion in awarding the lease.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese Expatriate Hospital</p>
<p>The Japanese Residents’ Association claimed existing Japanese hospital facilities are insufficient and requested a free lease of a hospital to accommodate indigent Japanese patients. The committee deemed the request reasonable and will propose that the board allow lease of the Chinese Isolation Hospital on Haining Road, allocating 15,000 yuan for repairs and charging a nominal annual rent of 100 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Dental Clinic</p>
<p>The British Women’s Association requested establishment of a free dental clinic for the poor. While sympathetic, the committee felt existing funds have more urgent public health uses and decided to postpone action.</p>
<p>(4) Stockpiling Emergency Medical Supplies</p>
<p>Fearing future import difficulties, the committee considered purchasing various medicines, bandages, and surgical supplies for emergencies. It resolved to recommend board approval in principle, with detailed planning and budgeting to be decided jointly by the health and finance department heads.</p>
<p>All recommendations were approved by the board at its regular meeting on the 17th.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Commodities Seized in Guerrilla Zones; Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Ban—Fifty Companies Including Jiufeng <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>To ban goods in guerrilla warfare areas that have been seized, controlled, or exploited, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has notified provincial and municipal governments: under Article 2 of the Banning Regulations, any goods of factories or businesses within guerrilla zones that have been seized, controlled, or exploited should be designated for ban by this Ministry at any time. It has been determined that fifty factories and businesses within guerrilla zones—including Jiufeng Flour Mill Co., Ltd.—have been seized, controlled, or exploited. All products from these concerns are now banned. Telegrams have been sent to provincial governments under the Ministry of Finance, instructing local customs and relevant authorities to enforce the ban. Industry associations in each province and city are to notify their members not to purchase these banned goods; violators may be reported by their associations to the government for investigation. In the Beijing‑Shanghai‑Suzhou‑Wuxi region, if a banned factory reestablishes production in other rear or safe areas with no relation to the original operators, its products may be distinguished from those of the original factory. Original factory owners may draft proposals for differentiation, submit them for Ministry approval, and, once approved, have their new products released separately.</p>

<p>To facilitate cargo transport, the Ningbo Defense Commander has, in addition to permitting the Ningbo–Dinghai and Shanghai–Dinghai routes to resume service, approved the Shanghai–Ningbo route. Vessels on these routes must apply for prior approval. German firm Lihe &amp; Co.’s ship Mofu arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday and is scheduled to depart directly for Ningbo tomorrow morning. The Japanese side has continued to oppose foreign vessels resuming Ningbo service—evidenced by the forced return of the De Ping ship carrying medical supplies to Ningbo—but Mofu has negotiated with the Japanese side and reportedly obtained approval.</p>
<p>Gaodeng to Sail to Dinghai; Ningbo–Dinghai Service Restored</p>
<p>Although the Ningbo–Dinghai route was approved for resumption, the Portuguese firm Zhengde Co.’s Libo, German firm Shiyide Co.’s Tianbao, and German firm Lulin Co.’s Gaodeng were successively detained by the Japanese side, interrupting the route. Now that Gaodeng has been released through the German consul’s intervention, it was originally to have sailed from Shanghai to Dinghai yesterday to resume the Ningbo–Dinghai route. Due to insufficient cargo loading, it has been rescheduled to depart today (the 19th) at 3 p.m. directly for Dinghai. Thereafter it will serve exclusively the Ningbo–Dinghai line.</p>
<p>Hanna Maintains Shanghai–Dinghai Service</p>
<p>The Far East Company of Germany’s Hanna, after receiving Ningbo Defense Commander approval for the Shanghai–Dinghai route, found operations difficult and planned to switch to the Shanghai–Wenzhou line. However, to maintain the Shanghai–Dinghai service, it will continue on that route. The company’s notice reads: “The German ship Hanna will sail directly to Dinghai at 4 p.m. on May 19, berthing at Jinliyuan Wharf. For business, please contact our manager at No. 5 Cathay Temple Street, French Concession.”</p>

<p>At No. 742 Jing’an Temple Road, the Cilian General Association’s Cade Refugee Shelter houses over 800 refugees, mostly dock workers and nearby factory employees with jobs. Recently, the property owner, Bank of China, leased the premises for a cinema. The Municipal Council Relief Association, the Cilian General Association, and the owner signed an agreement requiring vacation of the premises by the 22nd of this month, with plans to relocate all refugees to the First Refugee Shelter on Duxin Road. This has caused extreme panic among refugees, as Duxin Road is remote in western Shanghai; relocation would place them too far from work, leading to mass unemployment and hardship. Refugees are now electing representatives to petition the Municipal Council Relief Association, the Cilian General Association, and the owner, pleading for a two‑month extension to find alternatives or to be relocated to a more suitable site that will not disrupt their livelihoods. Whether they will succeed is uncertain. Refugees are resolute and appeal to all sectors for assistance to achieve a satisfactory resolution.</p>

<p>A refugee who arrived in Shanghai from Tongxiang yesterday reported that on the night of the 13th, Chinese guerrilla forces attacked Tongxiang and fought fiercely with the Japanese garrison there. A portion of the Chinese forces penetrated through the North Small Gate into the Chongshi Primary School and set fire to the county government building. The Japanese then dispatched additional battalions for a counterattack and sent aircraft to drop bombs, forcing the Chinese troops to withdraw to their original defenses. On the same day, as the Japanese advanced, they also bombarded Puyuan—over ten li from Tongxiang—with artillery, destroying several civilian homes there.</p>

<p>Ningbo suffered eight air raids by Japanese planes, resulting in many civilian casualties. To aid the victims and expedite relief work, the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association first advanced 10,000 yuan to the relief headquarters in Ningbo and actively solicited donations in Shanghai. Fellow villagers here responded with great generosity. According to the association, the National Government Relief Committee, deeply moved by the plight of the Ningbo victims, has authorized the Zhejiang Provincial Office to allocate 30,000 yuan for emergency relief. The relevant telegram from the Sixth District Commissioner’s office reads as follows (omitting the beginning):</p>
<p>“Reports of repeated air raids on Yin County have moved the Central Government to set aside 30,000 yuan in national currency, transferred via the Jinhua Farmers’ Bank. Please inform the Yin County magistrate to conduct a detailed survey of each affected household. Provide 20 yuan for each family with a fatality; 10 to 15 yuan for seriously wounded; 4 to 8 yuan for lightly wounded. Issue payment receipts accordingly and mail them to this office.

<h3 id="e75">Chinese Army Advances North of the Qiantang River, Strengthening Mobile Strategy; Military Personnel Arrive in Pudong; Future Operations Under Unified Command <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>According to reports from the Pudong guerrilla region, regular Chinese army units advancing northward along the Qiantang River consist of four divisions organized under the latest wartime structure. Each division comprises 20,000 to 25,000 men (5,000 to 10,000 more than peacetime strength), totaling 80,000 to 90,000 soldiers. Of these, 30,000 to 40,000 have entered the Shanghai–Hangzhou line area. Experienced military officers have been dispatched to various guerrilla zones to convey high command’s orders to irregular mobile units and to coordinate command between regular and irregular forces, thereby strengthening liaison. In the Pudong and Punan areas, guerrilla contingents under Ding Xichu, Tao Sheng, and Zhang Huifang have all received such officers, who have been instructed that henceforth all actions must obey regular army orders and no unauthorized advances or retreats are allowed. Irregular groups compelled by circumstances to defect are also welcome to return and be granted opportunities for rehabilitation. It is confirmed that most puppet “army” units have sent representatives to negotiate, and the situation is showing significant change.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Puppet Army Redeployment</p>
<p>Along the Shanghai–Hangzhou Railway, the puppet unit commanded by Xu Pucheng in Jiaxing, under orders from Yamada, Commander-in-Chief of Japanese forces in Central China, has been redeployed to defend Hangzhou. The Hucheng defensive duties left behind have been filled by Japanese garrison troops. The railway’s Japanese forces are now severely depleted, most having been concentrated along the Beijing–Hangzhou Highway and around Hangzhou to guard against Chinese attacks.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Withdraw from Huangdu</p>
<p>Chinese guerrilla units active near the Jiwangchao area in western Shanghai clashed with Japanese forces. Under the command of Colonel Zhao, leader of the Fourth Company of the Fourth Detachment, Third District Provincial Security Corps of Jiangsu Province, more than 100 Chinese soldiers launched a surprise assault on the Japanese, who then withdrew from Huangdu. Dozens of Japanese were killed, and the Chinese captured two machine guns and over ten rifles.</p>

<p>Since the puppet regime legalized opium sales, narcotics have also flowed into the International Settlement. Despite strict crackdowns by the foreign authorities, many criminals, lured by high profits, continue to traffic in secret. Recently, an unemployed ruffian nicknamed “Love Much Hemp Hide” teamed up with Korean rōnin to set up a drug ring at No. 14, Lane 53, Xiamen Road, selling heroin. Business was booming, with over 400 yuan of drugs sold daily. Detectives Feng Xiushan and Liu Zhaotian of the Old Town Police Station and officers from the Japanese Consulate Police raided the site on the 5th of this month, arresting two Koreans and seizing narcotics, then handing them over to the Japanese consulate. Two days ago, Feng and Liu received word that the Koreans had been released and were operating at the same location. They and consulate officers returned, capturing Koreans Won Ik-cheng, Ji Changzhu, and Bae Sun-gi, as well as a Chinese lookout, Sun Shengcai. An on-site masseur, Gao Fuhai, had picked up a packet of heroin from the floor and was also arrested. Later, they found another Korean, Kim Seong-jin, at No. 8, Lane 112, Fujian Road, and seized over 60 more packets of heroin. The ringleader Peng Ziyu (nicknamed “Little Uncle-in-Law”) escaped. The Koreans were sent back to the Japanese consulate for interrogation, while Sun Shengcai and Gao Fuhai were delivered yesterday morning to the Special Court No. 1, Criminal Division I. Counsel Ru Baoyi and Chen Ming documented the arrests and requested legal penalties. Sun Shengcai admitted he served as lookout for one yuan per day at Love Much Hemp Hide’s introduction. Gao Fuhai said he picked up the heroin intending to turn it over to police, but was arrested. After court-appointed attorney Wu Zhiping defended them, Presiding Judge Qian Hongye sentenced Sun Shengcai to three years and six months’ imprisonment as a warning; Gao Fuhai was acquitted and released.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Accountant Chen Xianmo’s Opinion on War Losses: Listing Losses as Deferred Assets; Accountants in Full Agreement <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The handling of war-related losses was first proposed by Accountant Xi Yushu and approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Experts have since submitted their opinions. The Shanghai Association of Accountants convened two committee meetings to discuss the matter. Accountant Chen Xianmo offered the following view:</p>
<p>“The objective is to protect enterprises. First, since the outbreak of hostilities, many corporate enterprises have suffered losses exceeding one-third of their capital. Under the Company Law, a shareholders’ meeting should be convened to report this. However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has amended these regulations, and law is not immutable. Furthermore, if a company’s assets become clearly insufficient to cover its debts due to war losses, it should declare bankruptcy. By this measure alone, many corporate enterprises would currently qualify as insolvent. It would be unwise to rigidly apply the old statutes without regard to human circumstances. As the saying goes, law is for the people. Regarding the interim regulations, many examples exist where wartime rules have superseded peacetime law. Clearly, treating war losses as deferred assets meets the practical needs of business and is sometimes unavoidable. Thus, although there was heated debate at the first committee meeting, by the second meeting there was unanimous approval.</p>
<p>“Second, having agreed to list war losses as deferred assets, the question arises whether surplus earnings should be used to pay dividends and bonuses. The Ministry’s directive implies that once losses are deferred, any remaining profits might be available for distribution. However, to balance corporate and shareholder interests, Xi Yushu proposed that if an enterprise’s earnings are ample, it may distribute dividends but suspend bonuses. This point was ratified by all at the accountants’ meeting. Accountants Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo further suggested capping dividend distributions at 5%. These dividend proposals will be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. In short, temporary legal amendments during wartime are neither rare nor unprecedented.”</p>

Other treasures include the mourning announcement of President Li Yuanhong and the thank-you note of the late Qing scholar Yu Yue. According to the exhibition’s organizer, a preview held at the Bankers’ Association drew high praise. The formal opening is set for the 31st of this month at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Yuqiaqing Road. Tickets are priced at three jiao, and all proceeds will be donated to refugees. Commemorative medals engraved with rare invitation motifs and a special exhibition brochure will also be issued. The exhibition runs for one week, closing on June 6.</p>

<p>The White Tiger organization has been very active along the Pudong wharves, dispatching ruffians by boat each night to loot cotton from foreign warehouses and ships along the river. Their attacks, carried out in large gangs, have been rampant. Late the night before last, Customs and the Water Patrol Station apprehended nine ruffians in central Pudong, who named the ringleaders Xiao Defu, Lu Miaojin, Zhu Wenyuan, Xiao Jiangfu, and Lu Baishi. Yesterday, all suspects were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation, and a manhunt has been ordered for their accomplices. Additionally, at the alley entrance to Chang Wharf in Pudong, another White Tiger cell led by puppet “Self-Defense Corps” commander Yao Jinxiang, Japanese translator Yang “Big Baozi,” and ruffians Chen Chaosheng and Chen Qiaosheng have nightly looted large quantities of cotton. Owing to jurisdictional limits in Pudong, they remain at large.</p>

<p>The principal wife of Songjiang tycoon Qian Xuanqing, Madam Zhou, predeceased him, leaving two daughters. The elder, Qian Runwen, married a Mr. Han and bore five sons—Han Jiefan, Zan Yu, Chunshou, Shengjue, and Shengqi—all now residing at No. 16, Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road, Shanghai. The younger daughter, Qian Runduan, age 36, married a Mr. Tang and lives at No. 59, Xinglong Village, Pushi Road, Shanghai. Qian Xuanqing also had a concubine, Xie Jianjia, who bore him five children—Qian Runlin, Runhu, Runci, Runliang, and Runming—all residing at No. 2, Xiafei Lane, Beitilu Road, Shanghai. Qian Xuanqing died in Shanghai on the 27th of this month. His estate is substantial, including 3,970 acres of prime farmland in Zhangkan, Qiwu, Songjiang County, and west of Shanghai Hongqiao Airport; five houses and over 30 acres of land in Songjiang; and movable assets comprising shares in Shanghai Yongyu Pawnshop, Xinyuan Pawnshop, the World Book Company, gold ornaments, and other items valued at 519,000 yuan in national currency. These assets are controlled by Xie Jianjia and her children Qian Runlin and Runliang. It is reported that Tang Qian Runduan and the five grandsons through Qian Runwen (one of whom, Han Jiefan, is deceased), along with lawyers Yan Jiang, Li Gengxiang, Yang Yunshi, and Ge Bangren, have filed a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court under Articles 1138 and 1140 of the Civil Code. They accuse Xie Jianjia and her children Qian Runlin, Runhu, Runci, Runming, and Runliang of withholding the entire estate and request division into seven equal shares. The first plaintiff, Tang Qian Runduan, demands one‑seventh; plaintiffs two through six (the five grandsons) also each claim one‑seventh. Yesterday, Judge Ma Yishu of Civil Division VII summoned both parties for testimony; defendants Qian Runlin et al. were represented by attorneys Zhang Yipeng and Xu Jiaji, who pleaded their case. Judge Ma briefly questioned both sides, then adjourned for a later hearing and urged the parties to reconcile out of court.</p>

<p>Wang Liansheng, 51, from Nantong, made his living pulling a rickshaw in Shanghai and lived alone at No. 42, Yuanshengli Lane 326, Caishi Road, French Concession. Last month he fell ill and could not afford treatment, and his condition worsened. Driven by poverty and illness, he took his own life by jumping into the well outside his back door on the evening of the 17th. Fellow lodgers rescued him from the water but found him already dead. The police arranged for his body to be taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Hall morgue. Yesterday, the Special District No. 2 Court’s chief prosecutor examined the body and concluded that Wang’s death was due to suicide by drowning after illness. With no next of kin, the authorities handed the remains to the Benevolent Society for burial. The Special District Rickshaw Pullers’ Mutual Aid Association has agreed to cover the funeral expenses.</p>

<p>Three women—Mrs. Deng Yang of Jiangbei, residing in a bungalow on Hede Road; Mrs. Zhu Lu; and Mrs. Zhang Wang of Nanjing—conspired to lure a 16‑year‑old Jiangbei girl, He Gendi; a 14‑year‑old girl, Gao Gendi; and a 16‑year‑old Tianjin girl, Chen Xiuying, by claiming they would secure jobs at Yangshupu Textile Mill paying one yuan per day. They secretly took them to a brothel at No. 10, Zhiheli, Yunhe Lane, Yunheli, owned by Mrs. Feng Lu, and confined them upstairs as prostitutes. The girls resisted and wept all day. From April 25 at 11:00 AM to the 28th at 4:00 PM, Mrs. Feng Lu’s husband, Feng Zhengbiao (a Chinese detective at the Old Town Police Station), refused to release them. When the case came to light, officers from Putuo Road Police Station’s Chinese and Western detective units arrested the five—Deng Yang, Zhu Lu, Zhang Wang, Feng Lu, and Feng Zhengbiao—and brought them before the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Jiang Shuzi of Criminal Division III sentenced Deng Yang to three years’ imprisonment; Zhang Wang to one year and six months; Zhu Lu to five years; Feng Lu to one year and six months; and Feng Zhengbiao to ten months, as a warning to others.</p>

<p>Reported yesterday: At 12:30 PM, Chinese detective Wang Jinsheng of the Jing’an Temple Road Police Station was ordered to Fahuazhen to handle a case. He and two other detectives rushed to West Fahuazhen. Because the area fell under Chinese jurisdiction, they first met at the puppet police station with puppet precinct officer Wei. Together they proceeded to Deji gambling den in East Fahuazhen, then in full swing with gamblers in attendance. Upon entering the den and mounting the stairs to the third floor accounting room to state their business, they found several Japanese staff from the “West Shanghai Entertainment Supervision Department” inside. When questioned, Wang declared his purpose, but the Japanese rebuked him for not coordinating with the Japanese military police. Wang replied he had already met with the puppet police station personnel. The Japanese, enraged, slapped Officer Wei several times, then produced handcuffs to arrest the three detectives. Wang protested his status as a public official, but to no avail. Overpowered, he was escorted downstairs by Japanese staff and taken to the Japanese Supervision Office on Yuguo Road, where he remains in custody as of press time.</p>

<p>A ten‑year‑old girl, Yang Xiaojiu, from Yangzhou, had been living with her blind mother in her hometown when she was kidnapped and brutally abused by foreign settlers. After losing her virginity, she managed to escape and return home, where she told her mother of the trauma. Fearing further assault, her mother sought help from fellow villager Mrs. Yao Zhu and brought her to Shanghai. Unbeknownst to the child, Mrs. Yao Zhu promptly handed her over to matchmaker Mrs. Yang Xiuqin of Suzhou in exchange for over 200 yuan. Having escaped one danger, the girl fell into another: on the afternoon of the day before last, Mrs. Yang introduced her to fisherman Xu Huaizhou of Jiangbei, who took her to a room at the Carde Hotel on Carde Road in western Shanghai and raped her. The girl endured threats and saw no means of escape until detectives from the jurisdiction learned of the crime, raided the hotel, and arrested all involved. The girl was sent for medical examination, while the two women and Xu were detained. Yesterday morning they were brought before the First Special District Court; police counsel Li Zhishan demanded severe punishment under the law. Judge Xiao, citing public morals, barred spectators and reserved judgment. Initially, all defendants denied wrongdoing, but under repeated questioning and the spotlight of the courtroom, they confessed—except Xu Huaizhou, who, defended by attorneys Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, claimed the encounter was consensual at Mrs. Yang Xiuqin’s instigation and involved payment, not rape. The court remanded all defendants pending sentence.</p>

<p>Yesterday at about 2:00 PM, during inventory at the accounting office of the new channel at Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession, staff moved all miscellaneous items outside and found a heavy wooden box over two zhang in length.

<p>Ye Axiang, 22, of Yangzhou, lived with her mother and maternal grandfather at No. 22, Bing’anli, Alake Road, French Concession. While working as a masseuse at a salon on Yuqiaqing Road, she became involved with a customer, 30‑year‑old Tianjin man Li Yuwen. She became pregnant, now five or six months along, and could no longer work. As her due date approached, she repeatedly sought out Li to arrange for the birth, but he evaded her. Distraught after fruitless visits, she took poison at home around 5:00 PM on the 17th. Her grandfather discovered her and called the police, who sent her to Guangci Hospital. Her poisoning was too severe, and she died at 8:00 PM that night. The hospital notified the police, who transferred her body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Hall morgue.

<p>Drivers Wu Zhenhua, Zhuo Shiliang, and Gao Rongsheng of Xiangsheng Automobile Company went yesterday (17th) afternoon to dine at Fuxing Restaurant opposite Zhaofeng Park on Yuyuan Road. At that time, owing to the crowding of diners, Wu’s foot was stepped on painfully by a mourner named Wang Agen. A verbal dispute ensued, and Wang summoned his followers Wang Shaoxiang, Xi Yusheng, Lü Zhicai, and others, who rushed into the kitchen, seized kitchen knives and spatulas from the staff, and engaged in a violent fight with Wu Zhenhua and the others. Outnumbered, Wu had his leg slashed and Zhuo Shiliang suffered a deep cut to the head. Their injuries were severe. Nearby Chinese constable Hua, on duty, hurried to the scene and arrested the assailants Wang Shaoxiang, Xi Yusheng, and Lü Zhicai. The injured Wu Zhenhua and companions were taken by carriage to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning the police station escorted the defendants to the First Special Court, Criminal Division Eight, charging them with assault. Judge Fang convened the hearing, but as the victims were too severely injured to appear, the court took brief statements from the defendants and ordered them remanded, with the hearing postponed to a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Qichang Wharf Incident: Patrolman Beaten <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>A Russian patrolman and a Chinese night watch leader employed at the British firm Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.’s Qichang Line Wharf in Pudong were assaulted twice by workers from the Japanese Field Post Office. The company reported the matter to the British Consulate, which took it up with the Japanese authorities. The incidents occurred on Sunday (14th) and Monday (15th) at the Japanese Field Post Office housed within the South Seas Tobacco Company in Hongkou. More than a hundred Chinese laborers employed there commuted daily via ferry from Gonghexiong Wharf in Pudong, under the supervision of a European manager. On the afternoon of the 14th at about 5 p.m., over a hundred laborers returned by ferry from Hongkou; after disembarking, about ten began kicking a ball on the wharf’s open ground. Fearing disorder or broken windows, the Russian patrolman politely intervened. In response, head foreman and translator Yang Wenjin, small foreman Wu Miaosheng, Yang Kun, Peng A’er, and others directed laborers to surround and brutally beat him. Chinese night watch leader Aju attempted to mediate but was also severely beaten. Aju’s whistle was mistaken by the wharf fire brigade for a fire alarm, and responding members were also attacked. With no responsible official on duty during the holiday, the workers departed after achieving their aim. On the morning of the 15th at about 7 a.m., the same group of post office workers, including over ten Japanese, returned by ferry from Hongkou, dragged the wounded Russian officer from his recovery and beat him again with iron rods and other weapons, inflicting a head wound and severe injuries. The European manager, alerted by the commotion, intervened, and the assailants finally returned to Hongkou. The injured patrolman was taken to the hospital. Pudong General Office reported the incident to the British Consulate, which negotiated with the Japanese military. At 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, two Japanese naval officers and an interpreter, together with the chief supervisor of Gonghexiong Wharf, visited the scene in Pudong to investigate the assaults, with a view to punishing the perpetrators and preventing future incidents.</p>

<p>Enticement to Criminal Acts, Abuse, and Abandonment – Woman Sues for Support; Awaiting Injury Report for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Cheng Baohua, a 26-year-old woman from Qingpu, represented by attorney Yuan Zunying, and accompanied by her four-year-old son Zhong Xiaomao, filed a complaint yesterday in the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court against Zhong Xuchu (25, native of Hubei, residing at No. 9 Dakang Lane, Bai’er Road–Wangzhi Road intersection). She alleges that the defendant lured her into illicit cohabitation and, upon discovering she had no husband, abused and then abandoned her and their child. She seeks criminal prosecution under Articles 229, 277, 286, 293, and 294 of the Criminal Code and, in a related civil action, requests that the court require the defendant to pay her 30 yuan per month for support until age 60 and 20 yuan per month for the child’s maintenance and education until age 20.</p>
<p>According to her statement, she arrived in Shanghai in November of the 24th year [1935], was seduced by the defendant’s claim of being unmarried, and cohabited with him at No. 7 Xiesheng Li, Laoshengu Road, until December 20 of the same year when she gave birth to a boy, the second complainant Xiaomao. She repeatedly urged him to marry her, but he delayed with various excuses. In November last year he brought her to his home, where she learned he had a wife. After reproaching him, he began to abuse her. On March 22 this year he beat Xiaomao’s left foot, and on March 26 he again beat Cheng’s chest. She reported him to the police station, and he was detained overnight, but thereafter he abandoned them. She then requested an injury examination from the prosecutor’s office. She asks the court to proceed accordingly and to order the defendant to meet living expenses as noted. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Miao Qingbang opened the hearing and summoned both parties. After brief statements from each side, the court ordered the case files from the prosecutor’s injury examination and adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Shad (Hilsa) Fish <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jiazhen</p>
<p>According to Li Shizhen’s Compendium of Materia Medica, “Shad fish is also called plague fish.” The origin of this name is unknown. People call it hilsa because it appears only in early summer, marking the season. The shad is sweet, neutral, and non-toxic. Though its composition has not been chemically analyzed, its rich, fatty flesh implies a high lipid content. Fish meat generally contains abundant phosphorus and protein, and hilsa is no exception. Some say its composition resembles turtle liver oil, though there is no conclusive proof. Today many savor hilsa for its flavor yet neglect its medicinal value, eating the flesh and discarding the scales—what a shame!</p>
<p>Shad flesh is usually served with meals or wine, but its therapeutic effects are remarkable and it can be used externally. Briefly:</p>
<p>(1) Internal Tonifier. Meng Shen said, “Shad can replenish deficiency.” Zhang Luyu said, “Shad is tonifying, warms the middle, and boosts qi.” Modern doctor Wang Jimin also asserted, “Fish liver oil is extracted from turtle liver as a supreme lung tonic. China’s hilsa has similar effects. Fifty years ago, British physician McGovern, then residing in Ningbo, claimed it could treat tuberculosis.”</p>
<p>(2) External Remedy for Burns. The Ningyuan Materia Medica states, “Steam the hilsa flesh, collect the oil in a jar buried in earth, and apply the ointment to scalds and burns with great effect.”</p>
<p>When harvesting shad scales, do so when the fish is alive, plucking two scales from the dorsal region; longer, pointed scales are best. Scales from dead fish are far inferior. The scales also have these uses:</p>
<p>(1) Treating scalds and burns. The classic Fengyuan Materia Medica says, “For scalds and burns, apply hilsa scales fried in sesame oil; immediate effect.”</p>
<p>(2) Treating bleeding nevi. Cai Yunbai said, “If a person’s birthmark bleeds uncontrollably, apply a hilsa scale; it immediately forms a scab and heals.”</p>
<p>韮菜青菜</p>
<p>— Nanzi</p>
<p>Zhou Ying of the Jin dynasty lived simply, despising city life; he spent his days at home tending vegetable plots with wine for pleasure. He particularly loved chives and bok choy, claiming no delicacy could surpass them. He said, “Early spring chives and late autumn bok choy sustain one through the long year.” Wealthy urbanites scorn such humble garden greens while Zhou delighted in them. Chives prefer moist soil near water and even more shade. Though not regarded as gourmet fare, Hunan and Jiangxi locals prize them; villagers always plant chives much like herbalists rely on licorice. In mid-spring, tender yellow-green chive leaves are lovely and palatable; after a month their flavor wanes, though new shoots replace them. By late summer they become waxy and tasteless, yet the fresh shoots are even more delicious—a curious marvel. Chives suit digestive health and villagers use chive roots to treat bruises, centipede and snake bites, reputedly invigorating blood.</p>
<p>Bok choy, called qingcai by Hunan natives—a puzzling name—thrives in cold seasons, though some varieties grow any time. In Shanghai, bok choy is abundant. Mild in flavor and nourishing, it contains many vitamins, as Westerners note. Simply eating vegetables and plain rice benefits body and mind without question. Bok choy also prefers moisture and frost; winter frosts improve its flavor. Young shoots of bok choy are prime for stir-frying with meat. After winter, when leaves yellow, villagers pull up and sun-dry the roots, pickle them as “salted greens,” which are delicious stir-fried with cured meat or in soups. In these hard times, cultivating home vegetables is economical and healthful, serving both country and individuals well.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Foods Suitable for Yin-Deficient Constitutions (Part II) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>(17) Soft-shelled Turtle Shell Soup—The hard shell of the soft-shelled turtle, sold in pharmacies as “biejia,” costs only 0.80 yuan per liang and is richest in yin-nourishing components. Take five qian daily with several red dates, boil and sip as tea; it treats yin deficiency with tidal fever, bone steaming, cheek flushing, and palm heat. Frequent drinking harms none.</p>
<p>(18) Garlic—Known to benefit the digestive tract and lungs, garlic supports lung health but does not cure tuberculosis. It is a supplementary food that nourishes the lungs and enhances resistance. Those accustomed may eat liberally; others should limit to one or two cloves daily. Avoid garlic when fever or internal heat from lung disease is severe. Raw garlic is best; pickled garlic is less potent.</p>
<p>(19) Chives—Also lung-nourishing, with effects similar to garlic but milder.</p>
<p>(20) Euryale Seeds, Chinese Yam, Lotus Plumule—These three foods, when eaten as snacks, help those with seminal emission issues, offering mild kidney reinforcement. Chronic cases may need medicinal treatment.</p>
<p>(21) Job’s Tears (Coix Seeds)—Also called “yimi,” coix has lung-clearing and nourishing effects, rich in protein, harmonizing and powerful. It aids damp elimination and guards against tuberculosis. Cook a bowl daily; those with yin deficiency or suspicion of lung issues can eat it regularly. Coix requires about four hours to cook and often contains weevil holes; pick carefully. If it appears milky or causes discomfort, discontinue.</p>
<p>(22) Lotus Root Starch—Excellent for those prone to hemoptysis, it nourishes blood and stops bleeding better than veal liver. Women with scant blood should also eat it. Genuine lotus starch is costly. Before the war, only Sanyou Industrial Co. sold authentic starch; it best aids recovery in hemoptysis. The white tablet starch sold in southern goods shops is often adulterated arrowroot or potato starch, forming a white jelly but not true lotus starch—an unfortunate shortage.</p>
<p>(23) Blood Soup—Chicken blood soup is extremely nourishing; pig blood soup has equal value. Once considered barbaric by Westerners, modern organotherapy has proven “blood begets blood.” Cooking chicken or pig blood with chicken broth or spinach heightens the effect.</p>
<p>(24) Cuttlefish—Has modest yin-nourishing ability and is not disadvantageous.</p>
<p>(25) Chicken Eggs—Long recognized for health maintenance, need no elaboration.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Eating Cold Rice <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Lide</p>
<p>Many people, to beat the summer heat, enjoy eating cold rice. In the morning they cook all three meals’ rice at once, then eat the chilled rice for lunch and dinner. This seems economical and refreshing, saving time. However, cold rice takes longer to digest because the stomach must generate extra heat to process it, and moisture loss in the cooled grains makes them harder and more reliant on stomach juices. These factors often lead to gastric problems. Is saving a little effort worth risking greater harm?</p>
<h3 id="e101">After Weaning <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>Weaning is a critical milestone for children, presenting significant challenges in care and nutrition. The difficulty arises partly from the abrupt change in environment and partly from the child’s developing habits. The end of nursing marks the start of a new life stage: gradually replacing breast milk with adult foods. If a child feels uneasy losing the nursing habit, caregivers must patiently teach drinking from cups and eating from bowls. Once the new feeding routine is established, nursing will fade naturally.</p>
<p>Form is one matter; substance another. After weaning, besides matching flavors and textures to the child’s preferences, the physical properties of food are crucial. Hard or tough foods hinder digestion and can injure the child’s digestive tract. Initially, thin congee mixed with fresh beef or young chicken broth is best, helping the child gain weight in a month. After a month, introduce fiber-rich vegetables such as bok choy, spinach, celery, lettuce, and amaranth, finely chopped into soups or thin congee, or baked into simple biscuits with flour. Both raw and cooked eggs, fresh milk, pork bone broth, orange juice, yam, and well-cooked beans can also be given. Portions should suit the child’s appetite—rather, give small amounts more frequently—and avoid overfeeding. Additionally, regular sun and fresh air baths are essential.</p>
<h3 id="e102">What Is “Miscellaneous Gastric Disorder”? <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>Commonly Known as “Fire in the Stomach Disease”</p>
<p>When one’s diet is irregular or one’s emotions depressed, indigestion often follows: food is eaten yet the abdomen swells, even to the point of vomiting—this is due to excess gastric acid. Over time it easily develops into symptoms such as acid reflux and a sensation of food stuck in the chest. By contrast, the so‑called “miscellaneous” disorder behaves almost oppositely. With slight hunger the stomach immediately pains, and only eating brings relief; after a while the pain returns, growing worse day by day until one appears sallow and emaciated, spiritless and fatigued, unable to move. Simple miscellaneous gastric disorder often afflicts those with busy work schedules: irregular mealtimes, eating late when already full, or ignoring chilling foods; or working strenuously immediately after eating. Each day around eleven in the morning and five in the afternoon—just before lunch and dinner—the pain strikes violently, yet upon finishing a meal it disappears as if by magic. The cause lies in excess “fire” in the stomach, which causes the pain; a weakness of stomach qi, which drives one to rely on food for relief; but the food is consumed by the fire and yields no nourishment. Hence even though one continues eating, one remains yellowed, emaciated, and fatigued.</p>
<p>Treatment should employ Xiao Jian Zhong Tang without cinnamon twig, adding one to two portions of Sichuan peony root and two to three qian of gardenia seed to harmonize liver and stomach; combine with licorice, wheat, and large dates to strengthen the spleen and gently harmonize the center. Also serve roasted Chinese yam mixed with lard and white sugar as a snack—soon recovery will be swift.</p>

<p>In the last issue’s article on coix seed, the phrase “adding sugar makes it liable to produce disease” contained a misprint: the character for “disease” should have been the character for “phlegm.” In the monograph on foods for yin deficiency, the sentence “soft‑shelled turtle is turtle‑plastron soup” contained a misprint: the character for “is” was replaced by a similar but incorrect character.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Finance: Rumors Dispelled, Spot Cash Market Plunges <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday the spot cash market—red‑hot in off‑exchange trading—suddenly reversed violently, repeatedly breaking through the two thresholds at 2,140 yuan and 2,130 yuan. The catalyst was a report indicating that Britain, America, and France appeared poised to adopt a united, resolute stance on the Gulangyu incident, and that most of the Japanese landing forces had already withdrawn—signs of a gradually easing situation. All the rumors previously circulating in the market were thus dispelled. At the same time, it was learned that the Chinese and foreign banks in both concessions still refused to accept banknotes issued by the Hua Wo Bank, making it difficult to shake the entire Chinese financial establishment. Consequently market sentiment turned weary; goldsmiths, pawnshops, and cash exchange houses vied to dump holdings, and even a certain currency‑exchange concern that had recently bought in began liquidating. Although some bullion houses continued to add speculative purchases, the sellers’ momentum dominated, and the market price plunged, closing at a low of 2,127 yuan—down 17 yuan from the previous close. Trading volume remained flat, only about 600 taels of opening trades, while ornament‑gold prices at the silver shops fell by one yuan. Customs gold and 22‑carat pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Down 17 Yuan</p>
<p>From early morning—each bar of ten taels—sentiment weakened immediately. The first sellers called 2,110 yuan per tael, but buyers held back. Calls then gradually lowered until the silver‑shop syndicate sold 50 taels to a bullion house at 2,135 yuan as the opening price, nine yuan below the previous close. Shortly thereafter another bullion house absorbed 50 taels from fellow dealers at the same price. Cash exchange houses followed, selling 50 taels to a bullion house at 2,134 yuan. The bullion house’s interest waned and it kept pressing the price down. Money‑exchange brokers and dealers trailed by exchanging 50 taels at 2,131 yuan. Next the silver‑shop syndicate and cash exchange houses each sold 50 taels to the bullion house at 2,131 yuan. The selling intensified, immediately breaching the 2,130‑yuan level. Money‑exchange brokers offloaded a total of 100 taels to a bullion house, driving the price down to 2,128 yuan. Soon after, at the same price, brokers again transacted 50 taels. Thereafter the selling calmed and the price instantly rebounded two yuan when brokers bought 50 taels from cash exchange houses at 2,130 yuan. A bullion house then bought 50 taels from brokers at 2,129 yuan as the midday close. Afternoon trading was very thin—initially stable, with a bullion house selling 50 taels to brokers at 2,129 yuan. Thereafter silence reigned until about 3:30pm, when brokers sold 50 taels to a bullion house at 2,127 yuan, the market bearing a languid tone. After that the market quieted again. The evening close remained at 2,127 yuan—17 yuan below yesterday’s late close, with an intraday range of eight yuan. Cash exchange houses sold at 2,135 yuan and bought in at 2,120 yuan. Spot gold stayed roughly fifty yuan below the listed gold price, with no new opening trades.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Down Only One Yuan</p>
<p>The silver shops’ initial quotes for gold ornaments per tael remained unchanged. By 10:20am, as the spot cash market turned downward, they also listed prices one yuan lower: major firms at 217 yuan, newer houses at 215 yuan, with buy‑back at 109 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Unchanged as Before</p>
<p>London, 17th—Pure gold in London remained unchanged at 7 pounds 8 shillings 5½ pence per ounce. As a result, the Bank of China’s purchase price for Chinese cash silver stayed at 1,211 yuan 90 cents. The customs‑quoted gold price held steady at 2 yuan 39.96 fen, and Shanghai’s standard gold price remained at 1,207 yuan 20 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Foreign Exchange Forwards – Heavy Turnover in Resales <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday’s foreign exchange market, spot rates moved little due to persistent offers from non‑bank speculators, though forward rates saw both profitable arbitrage (by Japanese banks and Tianjin syndicates) and heavy selling pressure from outside speculators. The overall tone was firm but somewhat rigid, with active trading. Swap rates tightened slightly. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market was rather stagnant, showing no clear gain or loss.</p>
<p>At the morning open, London sterling near and far forwards were unchanged; New York silver was steady, and London banknote gold saw no change. Exchange rates—sterling against the dollar, sterling against the Haikwan (Shanghai Customs tael), sterling against the franc, and likewise the dollar against sterling, Haikwan, and franc—were all flat. The central bank’s posted rates for all currencies remained as before. At the banks’ morning spot selling, sterling was 8s2½d, the U.S. dollar was 16.0625 yuan, both matching the previous close. After opening, foreign firms scrambled to absorb spot sterling and dollars, supplied jointly by British and American banks, yet rates held at 8s2½d and 16.0625 yuan. When HSBC announced its board rates, they also did not move. Upon publication of the silver balancing tax, there was no change, remaining at 5.5%. Meanwhile, profitable forward deals (by Japanese banks and Tianjin syndicates) continued: June sterling at 8s1.875d, July sterling at 8s1.25d, and June dollars at 15.9375 yuan. Despite ongoing arbitrage bids, heavy selling from speculators led Dutch firms to offer July dollars at 15.8125 yuan and 15.84375 yuan for arbitrage—a slightly firmer tone. Approaching noon, spot Hong Kong dollar traded at 55.375 yuan, the market calm. At the banks’ noon spot close, sterling and U.S. dollar rates matched the morning; the Hong Kong dollar remained at 55.375 yuan.</p>
<p>Subsequently, profitable forward sales first covered by purchasing McGeary &amp; Co.’s spot sterling at 8s2½d, then by purchasing China &amp; Co.’s spot dollars at 16.0625 yuan; foreign houses also bought China &amp; Co.’s spot dollars at 16.0625 yuan. Supply and demand balanced, leaving the market unchanged. Afterwards, Anderton &amp; Co. supplied foreign houses with spot Hong Kong dollar at 55.375 yuan—also steady. At the evening close, banks’ spot selling rates were sterling 8s2½d, U.S. dollar 16.0625 yuan, and Hong Kong dollar 55.375 yuan—unchanged from yesterday’s noon close.</p>

<p>Premiums on bank‑accepted bills have slightly declined over the past two days, with the highest around 1.50 yuan and the lowest down to 0.50 yuan—that is, a 1,000‑yuan note now trades at 0.0050 yuan in bill premium swaps on 1,000‑yuan face.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange‑accepted bills fell sharply, dropping in the morning to the 55‑yuan level per 1,000 yuan face, closing at 50.025 yuan at noon. In the afternoon it stabilized, marking a one‑yuan plunge from the previous day. Call‑money rates remain at 0.1 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, pure British gold and sterling‑dollar exchange rates were unchanged, but local foreign‑exchange houses were busy settling funds with banks, which had strong appetite. With ample supply from foreign banks, market prices were stable. When the spot cash market opened hot, bullion houses and money‑exchange dealers dumped holdings, weakening conditions. As international authorities took a firm stand and concession situations eased, confidence steadied, and surplus funds were released. Small holders followed in selling, supplying abundant chips and causing prices to plummet. In the afternoon the market lingered weak: compared to the previous day large declines ensued. Sterling and dollar banknotes in active issue soared in supply; Hong Kong and Australian notes were in lesser demand; all moved downward. Transactions in the exchange guild did not open. Yesterday’s price changes: Banknote sterling fell by 0.3 yuan, sterling bills by 0.04 yuan; U.S. dollar bills down 0.2 yuan, dollar notes down 0.017 yuan; Hong Kong notes down 0.002 yuan; Canadian bills down 0.01 yuan; Australian notes down 0.1 yuan; other currencies unchanged.</p>

<p>Tianjin, 18th—At the remittance houses compared with yesterday: sterling rose by 0.03125 yuan, U.S. dollar by 0.0625 yuan; Shanghai remittance unchanged. Morning open prices: sterling 7s9.375d, U.S. dollar 15.50 yuan, Hankow remittance (per 100 yuan Shanghai receipts) 100.00 yuan.</p>
<p>Further telegrams report: on the dark‑pool market for the Tianjin Joint Bank Note at morning open the 18th compared to the 17th, the note rose 1.50 yuan per 100‑yuan French‑denominated note, now purchasable at 121 yuan Joint Bank Note for 100 francs. “On‑the‑spot Joint Bank Note” at 1 yuan par is now worth 0.8244628 francs.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 18th—At local remittance houses, the morning open matched yesterday’s noon; at 10:55am sterling rose by 0.03125 yuan to 1s2.875d, the U.S. dollar rose by 0.0625 yuan to 29.00 yuan, and Shanghai remittance rose by 0.25 yuan to 180.25 yuan per 100 Hong Kong dollars. By 2:30pm sterling, the dollar, and Shanghai remittance were unchanged from the morning. Morning open: sterling 1s2.84375d, dollar 28.9375 yuan, Shanghai remittance 180.00 yuan per 100 Hong Kong dollars.</p>

<p>In the off‑exchange securities market yesterday, sentiment was buoyed again by the firm Anglo‑American stance on Gulangyu, and by a decisive statement from the U.S. government anchoring confidence. Prices of many bonds were driven higher by multiple buyers—some up as much as 0.68 yuan—but the rapid rise prompted profits‑taking sales and a subsequent pullback. The market opened with strong sentiment and heavy buying: Lianhe, Tongkang, Yongfeng, Songmao saw eager purchases, and B‑ and W‑class issues surged past 52 yuan. Buyers then sold high in Tianjin, Datong, Dafeng, while Xiefeng, Hongkang, and Series No. 4 and 51 also saw selling, retracing back under 50 yuan. The early strength gave way to a natural reaction. In the afternoon the market stabilized, trading thinned, still showing early firmness then later fatigue. Tianjin Shengtong, Dafeng, Xinfeng, Yongkang continued to see selling. Most buyers were small holders; Xieda, Tongkang, Lemao, and Renchang also put shares on the market. As a result, the gains by day’s end were smaller than in the morning. Overall the market still rose by 0.15 to 0.10 yuan, with total turnover around 1,000,000 yuan. A concise summary follows.</p>
<p>In stock trading, fifty shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco sold at 7.30 yuan.</p>
<p>On the public share front, business was firm and active, with many buyers. Jardine Matheson saw broad transactions, rising to 18.90 yuan. Telephone Company stock, owing to an announced dividend and capital increase (converting each 50‑tael old share into 10 yuan of ten new shares), reached a record high of 99 yuan. Tramway stock enjoyed healthy demand, trading widely at 39 yuan. Swire &amp; Co. shares were 7.85 yuan; Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Co. shares were 36.25 yuan, both attracting buyers. SMC stock attracted much inquiry, trading at 7.90 yuan; Colonisation &amp; Agricultural Co. was firm at 8 yuan.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks saw scant trading: asking prices were too high.</p>
<p>In London, Far Eastern Company shares on the 17th (Wednesday) opened steady, with no change in any issues.</p>
<p>London‑quoted Chinese foreign bonds were sluggish on the 17th: selling offers were weak and there was no change. For example, the Anglo‑Chinese Five‑Percent Gold Loan (with bond scrip valued at 5,000 pounds face or 25,000 dollars) offered at 64 pounds 5 shillings, about 5 shillings below market rates.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Cotton Yarn: Banks Offload Stock, Yarn Market Shows Sudden Slack; Shuangma and Tiannv Fall by Five Yuan <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The cotton‑yarn market was uninspiring, continuing lower. Reports of repeated bombings at Shantou shook confidence, and prices already hovering at highs were easily unsettled. Rumor also spread that a bank was offloading its hoarded yarn, showing some market slack. Even the Shantou syndicate purportedly paused purchases, further dampening sentiment. Demand from the Hong Kong syndicate remained firm, but with some psychological caution, holders dumped stock, fearing no immediate rally. Trading was sparse and lacking vigor.</p>
<p>At the spot yarn market’s morning open, conditions were quiet. Dealers took a round of quotes before trading peacefully. Only around 10am did the market open: quotes were down by 0.50–1 yuan. Twenty‑count Shuangma yarn was 428 yuan spot, 417.50 yuan invoice, but buyer interest was weak. The Shantou syndicate cited bombing fears and made no buys. The Hong Kong syndicate bought only at cheap prices. Soon, unable to find buyers, holders rushed to sell: twenty‑count Shuangma yarn plunged to 424 yuan spot, invoice down to 415.50 yuan. By close prices were flat. In the afternoon rumors of financial sector liquidation kept market sentiment weak; intra‑dealer trades fell off. By close Shuangma spot was 423.50 yuan, invoice 416.50 yuan on few transactions. Total daily syndicate purchases totaled 1,000 bales. Twenty‑count Mahedi and Tiannv each fell by 5 yuan; Biqiudi fell by 4.50 yuan; Muyang by 4 yuan; thirty‑two‑count fine yarn remained unchanged; ten‑count coarse yarn fell by 2–3 yuan. Today shipments include 280 pieces to Tianjin, 2,080 to Shantou, 250 to Hong Kong, 115 to Guangzhou Bay, 550 to Beihai, and 75 to Haiphong. Syndicate buy‑volumes as follows: Tonghang 4; Hong Kong 5; Inland 6; Shantou 5; Yunnan 1; Total 1.0.</p>
<p>On the cotton‑cloth front, calico fell in the morning then regained by afternoon, ending slightly higher, though actual trading remained dead. Out‑town orders were scant. However, after several days of local declines, buyers covered positions, pushing prices back up. Twenty‑count Yueqin yarn reached 361 yuan—up about 2 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Recent American Cotton to Reach Nine Cents; Domestic Cotton Shows Improvement, Prices Slightly Up <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Overseas cotton‑cloth prices—New York cotton cloth rose sharply on news from Bombay and Liverpool, spurring buyers and covers, with July as the active month. Some forward and loan‑cotton releases caused slight retracement, yet visible export figures kept contracting. With current shortage, the near‑term rise to nine cents in July seems likely; if cotton prices climb further, loan‑cotton may be released. Yesterday Indian cotton jumped 4 rupees, Egyptian cotton over 10 pence; converting to yuan, U.S. and Brazilian cotton rose 1.50 yuan, Indian up 1.40 yuan, Egyptian up 0.60 yuan.</p>
<p>In Shanghai’s imported‑cotton market, overseas cotton’s rise kept local trading quiet, while incoming shipments crowded the docks, causing mills to defer purchases. A few days ago some orders were placed, but none yesterday. However, raw cotton remained scarce: mills bought 3,000 bales of Albizia cotton at 59–65 yuan. Below are yesterday’s mill‑delivery prices:</p>
<p>[Price list omitted in original Chinese—no data to translate]</p>
<p>Domestic cotton business, though not booming, was slightly livelier than days past, as Indian cotton’s strength lifted local prices. White Chinese cotton in good demand—mills seek it again to blend with imports. Yong’an Mill took 400 bales; dealers sold 750 bags of “Huojihua” from transit stocks, keeping spot cotton prices firm. Meanwhile pressed Indian cotton continued rising briskly. Domestic cotton prices followed suit.</p>
<p>No new shipments from northern Jiangsu—transport remains difficult—so none arrived yesterday. Current spot‑cotton conditions are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e115">Eastern Fine Cloth Predominantly Sold Off; Leading Brand Falls to 13 Yuan; Domestic Weaves Also Weakening <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday eastern white‑goods fine cloth offers sharply declined, causing sentiment to slacken and buyers to stand aside. Unbleached coarse cloth remained firm at mill quotes, held steady by hand‑carried stock at stable prices. Zhejiang, Anhui syndicates continued procuring brands at 11.3–14.3 taels for over a hundred bales; local dealers took nearly fifty bales. Fine cloth fell about 0.10 yuan per bolt; twill fell 0.10–0.25 yuan per bolt. Canton‑Zhejiang and local wholesale houses purchased only small lots of 50–60 bales. Dyed and finished autumn–winter weaves, flannel, and pile cloth from remote regions (Sichuan, Yunnan, Tianjin) saw light demand, while in‑season summer goods were fully absorbed by local syndicates, leaving little new buying. Deep and light dyed cloth both weakened, though locally tailors continued to transact summer‑weight whites: poplin, white gaunt, twilled canvas, and khaki saw vigorous trading at strong and high asks. However, striped府綢 (fu‑silks), bleached twills, striped bleached calicoes, and standard cloth all struggled, with buyers unloading hand stock at markdowns. Lun Chang floral cloth also retreated: all goods fell 0.10–0.50 yuan per bolt.</p>
<p>Eastern Fine Cloth</p>
<p>White‑goods fine cloth and twill faced a sharp collapse under heavy selling by large dealers, creating tremendous downward pressure. The market centered on the leading‐brand fine cloth as the benchmark, with everyone rushing to sell, pushing prices progressively lower. Early trading was chaotic: the leading brand plunged as low as 13.00 yuan. Other brands saw almost no official quotes. Later, profit‑taking buyers covered shorts and actual buyers made cheap purchases, so prices rebounded sharply. By close the leading brand fine cloth was quoted at 13.45–13.50 yuan—still about 0.20 yuan below yesterday’s board. Local dyers and wholesalers handled 400–500 bolts, while Jin‑Tsing syndicates bought over 200 bolts at the lows.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 18th, forty‑two bolts shipped to Tianjin; on the 19th, 115 to Tianjin, 60 to Yantai, 280 to Shantou, 115 to Hong Kong, 35 to Beihai.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Silks &amp; Tea: Japanese and American Silk Rally Pauses <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Overseas raw‑silk and silks from Japan and America have paused after their recent rises. Yokohama spot and forward silks each fell 12.00 yuan; New York nearby down 0.05 yuan, forward down 0.045 yuan. However in Lyon, silks from Japan and China saw gains: Japanese up 3 francs, Shanghai’s “Ziyu” silks up 4 francs, “Ziku” up 2 francs, Guangdong silks up 1.50 francs. The recent Japanese‑American rally, beginning around the 20th of last month, had driven Yokohama spot from 1,140 yuan to a record 1,300 yuan. But according to a long‑distance report from Yokohama, recent monthly raw‑silk exports have fallen to only 1,000 tan, compared with over 4,000 tan monthly in former days—an anomalous phenomenon.</p>
<p>Locally, yesterday’s silk market was also quiet; price drops were modest, trading slow. New York saw little business, Lyon had small spot transactions at 1,820 yuan—unchanged from the prior day. Dachang and Renchang bought 50 tan; Indian and African buyers remained cautious, awaiting fresh impetus.</p>
<p>New tea arrivals are few; offers still around the 200‑yuan level. Since last week’s Huzhou new crop offerings, selling displays looked firm, yet actual arrivals remain scant and trading little changed. This season foreign firms’ costs are high, and although navigation on the Zhejiang–Fuzhou line has resumed, no cargoes have yet arrived. Available supply comes via the Hangjiahu region, carrying higher costs. Yesterday China Tea Company bought 26 chests of Feng Zhenmei at 200 yuan, 20 chests of authentic Huzhou Zhenmei at 198 yuan; Po Chong &amp; Co. took six chests of Wuyue buds at 245 yuan. Jubilee, Jardine, and others made small purchases, but volumes were negligible. Prices were steady.</p>

<p>The rice market shows little change; the atmosphere remains one of brewing developments. Northern syndicate sales continue slowly, driven by local mill‑price falls and shifting financial conditions, resulting in almost zero large‑lot interest—though existing consignments are mostly being loaded, prompting infrequent small trades. Mill‑asked prices remain firm, keeping the market dull. Southern syndicates are also clearing stock in bits. On‑street and inland syndicates continue selling, totaling nearly 40,000 bags—No. 2 flour at 4.55 yuan, while Nos. 3 and 4 see little demand and no trades. The market remains on standby. On the 19th, 3,000 bags of flour shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The wheat market is extremely quiet. Mills’ foreign wheat arrivals continue uninterrupted, while domestic buyers remain unalert, and North China buyers are also dormant. As a result, the market is stagnant. Current price stands at 66.20 yuan, and newly arrived lots stubbornly refuse markdowns; even mill deliveries are scarce. The market remains deadlocked.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Rice Prices Keep Rising—What Is the Meaning of Price Limits? <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sources of japonica rice reported arrivals at Nangang, Fenglian, and other syndicates receiving No. 7–8 grades; Che Lun, Baozi, Su‑Tong‑Kun syndicates took 3,600–3,700 bags; Changzhou syndicate 250 bags. The market grew more chaotic: buyers, seeing high prices, still made purchases, so shops, to secure supply, bought at high quotes. At such tense times, though the market committee has tried to impose price limits, this is impossible. As a result, the limits have been breached and the off‑exchange market has vanished. All rice varieties now trade around 16–17 yuan, up 0.20–0.30 yuan from the last off‑exchange quote—this applies to both japonica and indica. Only the white glutinous variety, priced like foreign glutinous rice, remains stable. In short, this market phenomenon is wholly due to manipulation and monopoly. Based on stock levels, warehouse and shop inventories total over one million dan, yet such outcomes—tragic for Shanghai’s populace—have arisen. It is noted that 3,681 bags of rice have just arrived via Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Added Tax on Handling Permits, Wuhu Supplies Unhindered, Rice Pushed to Fourteen Yuan, Hope for Fixed Foreign Rice Prices <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, ordinary indica rice stocked in shops was traded in over 6,000 bags throughout the day. With warehouse holders allowed to pay levies as before, all high-grade quotas uniformly rose, up another 20 to 40 cents compared with the previous market. The price of indica rice has been pulled up to the 14‑yuan limit. Premium Wuhu-milled rice in the grey market opened at 14 yuan 70–80 cents, and sellers are still calling as high as 15 yuan. Nanjing indica rice has already exceeded 15 yuan. Market sentiment and prices continue to trend upward.</p>
<p>As for the previous report that existing shipping permits from production areas remained valid for transport, our earlier issue noted this; but yesterday rice merchants confirmed that old permits now require an additional tax of 80 cents per bag, and there is no hope of issuing new permits. Therefore, rice from Wuhu can still flow uninterruptedly—Wuhu glutinous rice arrives continuously just like Hong Kong glutinous rice—making it difficult for inland prices to recover.</p>
<p>Hong Kong foreign‑currency rice continued to arrive yesterday, but indica rice stocks are gradually dwindling. Western rice is holding firm at 19.50 yuan, refusing to budge for the moment, though overseas fixed prices are gradually approaching the Shanghai market. Trading houses have been eager to sell; yesterday there was demand for 2,500 tons from Saigon at 19.50 yuan, but grain merchants countered at 19 yuan and have already wired inquiries, which may be finalized in today’s or tomorrow’s return telegram.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s soybean market remained lackluster, owing to still‑limited sales venues and the fear that Hankou beans handled by Japanese merchants might continue flowing endlessly. From yesterday they began undercutting prices to attract buyers, causing more losses than gains ahead. In our district roughly 1,000 bags of Hankou soybeans changed hands at 8 yuan 30 cents per bag, down 10 cents from the opening price the day before. Additionally, 200 bags of Zhangyan beans bound for Hong Kong traded at 9 yuan 50 cents; 100 bags of Wuhu beans at 8 yuan 93 cents; and two railcars of Dalian beans at 8 yuan 70 cents ex‑warehouse, delivered at 8 yuan 80 cents—all down 2 to 3 cents from the previous market.</p>
<p>Today 1,620 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, and 1,700 bags of shelled corn to Tianjin.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s crude soybean oil trading showed slight activity, improving sentiment and lifting market prices by roughly 40–50 cents. For now, the market remains in a holding pattern. A total of 100 cases of Jiaozhou crude oil and 150 road‑delivery cases were opened at 29 yuan each; 370 tins of Dalian‑packed crude oil at 37 yuan 50 cents; and 50 barrels of Dalian barrelled oil at 38 yuan 50 cents. Soybean oil trades included 200 cases of Jiaozhou oil (see market‑price column), 100 cases of Qingqi oil, 300 tins of Qingdao oil, 300 barrels of Dalian oil, 30 barrels of Dalian bleached oil, and 50 barrels of Dalian Fengnian oil.</p>

<p>London dispatches report a slight easing: August futures at 7 shillings 1 pence per cwt, December at 6 shillings 2 pence, February next year at 6 shillings 2½ pence. Dutch cables show no change. Hong Kong landing charges set the mid‑price at 19 yuan 7 cents. Hence local guilds set two calls on coarse white refined: small grade at 2.5 cents, at 27 yuan 3.2 cents for 50 bags; small grade at 5 cents, at 27 yuan 2.5 cents for 100 bags. Bonded stock called at 19 yuan 1 cent, importers offered 19 yuan—negotiations pending. On‑hand stock at this warehouse under “Big Gold Money” label called at 27 yuan 6.5 cents. “Tai Che” white has no fluctuation: label at 26 yuan 9.0 cents for 100 bags, 26 yuan 1.5 cents for 100 bags. “Cotton White” small at 2 cents; Zhenji No. 1 at 26 yuan 8 cents; No. 2 at 3 cents; No. 3 at 25 yuan 8 cents; No. 4 at 3 cents.

<p>Black iron sheeting had been extremely firm as Tianjin, Qingdao, Yanbian guilds and local hot‑water‑bottle factories scrambled for stock.

<h3 id="e124">Means <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— by Geng Zhi</p>
<p>To succeed in any enterprise, great or small, one inevitably needs certain abilities—what we call economic talent or skill. From self‑cultivation and family order to governing a state and bringing peace to the world, this ability is indispensable.</p>
<p>Within this ability, however, we can distinguish two kinds of approaches: one follows the official, straight, orderly path—what is called the Way of Kings (wangdao); the other cares only about ends, sparing no means—what is called the Way of Hegemony (badao). In theory, the Way of Kings has been praised and practiced by ancient sages and kings, promising inevitable success and natural fulfillment. Unfortunately, in my view, this Way of Kings has never truly been practiced, or if tried, has never succeeded. A look through history reveals only examples of the Way of Hegemony.</p>
<p>Every founding emperor—from Liu Bang to Zhao Kuangyin to Zhu Yuanzhang—rose to power through the sword or by usurping thrones. Isn’t that the Way of Hegemony? Once on the throne, they indeed practiced benevolent rule, the so‑called Way of Kings; yet if we examine their motives and those of their descendants, who genuinely acted for the country and the people? Who did not seek to preserve their private realm? They borrowed the mantle of ancient sages to control the people and invoked sacred traditions to justify absolute loyalty—turning the populace into subjects who dared not move. Rituals, learning, and propaganda were but tactics to dull the people’s minds, akin to burning books and burying scholars. Wherein lies the Way of Kings? It remains the Way of Hegemony! Immediate conquest is hegemony; reluctant, forced governance remains hegemony.</p>
<p>If nations can only practice hegemony, it is no wonder that societies and families also resort to it. In such realms, there is no need to uphold proper talents or righteous methods—only expedient means matter. Indeed, expedient means have two facets, both characteristic of hegemony:</p>
<p>First, ruthlessness. Wielding life‑and‑death power against dissenters, scraping every inch of profit, shunning petitioners, and denying pleas. Best to make people suffer in silence or fear your mere shadow. All such brutality is an expedient means, effective for achieving one’s ends.</p>
<p>In truth, expedient means must be ruthless: lofty “writings” need a “ruthless hand”; great favors unrequited have led to murder to silence gratitude; much less ordinary affairs! How could one avoid ruthlessness?</p>
<p>Second, deception. Warfare never scorns deception, and since military affairs are paramount, deceit pervades all “business.” Without Zhuge Liang’s seven captures and releases, could he have ensured the southern tribes never rebelled? Elders still advise: “Speak only one‑third of what you know,” passing on the art of deception.</p>
<p>In a complex society—indeed in civilized circles—honest, straight‑laced people are often doomed to be labeled naive and fail utterly, while those adept at cunning and dazzling stratagems bloom like sunflowers in spring. Hence the best method is to set a trap in which people willingly walk or fall—never openly reveal your true aims or plead directly for help.</p>
<p>A person adept at ruthless means may succeed; one skilled in deceit may succeed. If ruthless and deceitful in equal measure, then one conquers all under heaven.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this, I find I am not extreme: Confucius, who preached the Way of Kings, how did his life end? Mencius, who embraced a hegemonic twist on kingly ways, what became of him? Did Liu Bang, Zhao Kuangyin, or Zhu Yuanzhang read Confucius and Mencius? And Christ, who spoke of the heavenly Way—what was his fate? Meanwhile, Hitler and Mussolini certainly were no devout Christians. Thus I say: the Way of Kings never truly existed; we wield the Way of Hegemony, and they wield hegemony—and in our time, that alone is real and justified!</p>
<p>“The world itself is at peace; fools create its turmoil.” This speaks to hegemony—the ruthless and the deceitful. Unable to change fools, we are doomed to employ their methods and thus entangle ourselves in perpetual self‑disturbance. Self‑disturbance is, in fact, the one true course of life!</p>

<p>— by Wang Li</p>
<p>The next afternoon I arrived at Lizhuang Bridge. Since the boat to Wujin had already departed, I had to wait until eight the next morning to catch one, so I paused my journey here.</p>
<p>Passing a teahouse entrance, an unfamiliar man suddenly grabbed me from behind. Startled and stunned, I turned—he merely smiled and pointed inside, saying, “Our squad leader asks for you!”</p>
<p>My heart leaped. When I looked into the teahouse hall, I saw our scout squad leader smiling at me. I stepped in with relief.</p>
<p>“How did you get here?” he asked with a grin.</p>
<p>“And you?” I replied.</p>
<p>They then told me they had captured someone and showed me the documents they had seized. Since I was feeling unwell and dizzy from the long journey, I planned to rest. A local comrade newly assigned to our squad insisted on booking a room for me at a nearby inn.</p>
<p>At eight the next morning, I boarded the boat to Wujin. Still dizzy, I propped my baggage against me and lay on my side.</p>
<p>When the boat stopped at a small riverside village, a man wearing dark glasses disembarked. No one paid him any heed—until midway, when we reached a no‑man’s‑land between our forces and the enemy’s. Lost in a haze, a gunshot snapped me awake. Turning, I saw the dark‑glasses man with a submachine gun emerging from the stern.</p>
<p>“Everyone, be reasonable!” he barked, pointing his weapon.</p>
<p>The entire boat fell silent.</p>
<p>He frisked each person, quickly stuffing any finds into his pockets. An upsurge of anger welled in me; I planned to strike his gun away when he reached me. Feigning sleep, I lay with eyes half‑closed. Yet after a round of searches, he passed me by. Once the boat docked, he escaped.</p>
<p>All the passengers muttered accusations at each other. By six that evening I set foot on another world’s soil—Wujin’s brightly lit streets—feeling as though I had descended into hell.</p>
<p>I walked among bustling compatriots, past puppet policemen, glaring neon lights, and charred, shattered ruins. Gritting my teeth, silent tears of grief and rage fell.</p>
<p>Without a good‑citizen certificate, I was refused by every inn until some townspeople guided me to a secret lodging. It was a half‑ruined wooden shack amid rubble, filthier than a pigsty, with only straw mats on the floor and two broken beds in the next room.</p>
<p>That night dizziness and exhaustion plagued me, yet excitement kept sleep at bay until dawn.</p>
<p>The next day I slipped past the health inspectors and boarded a steamer to Wuxi, then switched to Suzhou that afternoon. From the cabin window I saw scorched towns and villages—the land a wasteland. In silence, hatred aflame in my heart, I thought of home.</p>
<p>Had my hometown been reduced to ashes too? I felt grief, then reproached myself: how could I hope my home alone survive? Our vast land was occupied; millions of compatriots had lost life, property, and freedom. I must not selfishly wish my village safe nor guard it greedily!</p>
<p>On the way to Suzhou I endured a fifth inspection, restraining my anger with all my might. Rage only intensified my dizziness; my body felt as weak as one stricken by serious illness.</p>
<p>After one night in Suzhou, I took a boat home. From afar, as I glimpsed the countryside, a chaotic blend of sorrow and relief gripped me.</p>
<p>Stepping onto native soil, I found it changed under recent tensions, yet spared major disaster. In my father’s and younger brother’s astonished joy at our reunion, my heart felt as though a heavy weight of lead had lifted. Exchanging all that had happened in the past year, we embraced as if reborn.</p>
<p>Once excitement subsided, my frail body felt as slack as an unstrung bow. Glancing at my father’s face, I saw how much older he had grown in this past year.</p>

<p>— by Li Chen</p>
<p>Wildflowers sprout at the base of walls; bright blossoms emerge amid tangled undergrowth, offering a weary traveler a fleeting comforting smile. Yes: if this turbulent world is a desert, the flower is a single spring. Amid the swirling winds and thunderous cosmos, through it we glimpse a cleared, sunlit sky.</p>
<p>In solitude, flowers seem the tranquilizers for a restless life—who would not find their wounded spirit soothed by them?</p>
<p>Yet this world seems so narrow it cannot contain even one fragrant bloom!</p>
<p>Thus, when the boundless journey unfolds before us, each person drifts like a rudderless sailboat. Where will the wind carry us? No one knows.</p>
<p>To find a flower, a bit of solace, countless lives must be sacrificed—to free fragrant grass pressed in rocky crevices; to guide a lost lamb home; to beautify the world and warm the universe. Who would begrudge a handful of sweat, a drop of blood, or even one’s life?</p>
<p>Braving forests and deserts, countless souls courageously embark on the journey, bearing wind and frost, shouldering hardship, trudging miles upon miles. Yet some meet lions or tigers on mountain paths and perish together in fierce combat; others, through a single mistake, swallow a lethal but lovely‑looking blossom…</p>
<p>I am moved by these “aspirants who die in pursuit.” Through their lives they removed obstacles, leaving a broad avenue for the future. They offer us the lesson of “struggle” and the warning of “poisoned flowers.” Is the ancestral legacy more precious than this “bloody experience”?</p>
<p>If you cling to a potted plant by your window or yearn for early blossoms in a greenhouse, then look afar: the free kingdom full of brilliant blooms waves to you. Strive bravely to seek it! The blood and flesh of our ancestors have already paved the great path for you!</p>

<p>I’ve opened this small foundry, which never harmed any of you—so why all the scowling and harassment? Heaven spared me from starvation, left me this little livelihood; bombs haven’t blown me up, fires haven’t burned me. Covered in filth like a dog, I crept back, pieced together this shabby place, and took on a bit of business to steal a bite. Yet you treat me like I’ve struck it rich! Getting rich? Only by becoming an “official” or a “bureau chief,” or by selling one’s conscience—extorting everywhere, relying on special power to bully your own people. Someone like me, just not starving is enough! Who’d have thought that surviving hunger would get me executed by you? You beat me until I could hardly stand! Where could I even lodge a complaint?</p>
<p>I bought that iron in broad daylight, with a seller and an invoice—yet you thought you’d found a loophole, shouting and hauling me off, tying me with hemp rope, then in handcuffs! Am I a bandit? Bandits accuse the innocent of being bandits! How could I escape your clutches? Such force was needless. Your “headquarters” flogged me with whips until I rolled on the ground—what crime had I committed? You beat me mute, then shoved me into a back room, dark and damp, the air fetid with mildew and stench. Yet since you pitied me enough not to starve me, I got two bowls of rice a day—more than I could eat. Five days in detention, then on the sixth they hauled me out, released me, and cuffed a fist into my back, saying, “Be reasonable, friend, off you go.” I’m a bandit—so why let me go? Back at home I learned you demanded 100 yuan! You’re kidnappers, bandits, wolves! You use special power to bully your own people. If you need money, no need to be so brutal—beating a man to this state when I never robbed anyone, never killed your father! How long will these wounds take to heal? I ache—where can I complain?</p>
<p>To whom can I complain? Relatives? Friends? They grit their teeth, dare not help; they’re all afraid! You say, “Behave, or we’ll hand you over to the military police.” Ah! To whom can I complain? Just reminding you:</p>
<p>Is there any place to live here? You swagger past me, glaring with red eyes—I tremble all over. If I don’t starve, I’ll sure die of rage! I cannot go on living; I have to leave, leave for…</p>
<p>Ah! The pain!…</p>

<p>A friend returning from Sichuan’s Chongqing reports a town called Ziliujing where oil springs from the ground unaided. The flow is abundant, and its quality matches foreign kerosene exactly. The locals, ignorant of its value, let anyone take it for a few cash per ounce at local stalls. This oil closely resembles American petroleum. When Americans first discovered such natural oil springs, they rapidly developed mines, and many grew wealthy. China now imports all its kerosene from America, shipping it worldwide—proof of its profitability. The Chongqing oil has a slight odor, likely due to a lack of proper refining methods. If those could be perfected and widely applied, would this not be a great boon to the nation?</p>

<h3 id="e131">Report on the Commodity Exhibition <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— by Lan Yan</p>
<p>It is the best method for evaluating domestic product samples, and I hope it will stand alongside imported goods for direct comparison.</p>
<p>Although May is a month of blood‑soaked remembrance, various exhibitions have been bustling: the Penglu Relief Produce Expo, the Dashin Company’s art charity sale, and yesterday (the 15th) from 2 p.m. at the corner of Jing’an Temple Road and Muerming Road, the Shanghai Commodity Exhibition opened.</p>
<p>This exhibition differs from those in commercial markets. Not long ago two new markets opened, yet they peddled inferior goods—so shameful! One market’s opening ceremony even featured many female celebrities holding ribbon‑cuttings, as though enticing people to buy shoddy wares—surely infuriating. In contrast, the exhibition in the new Shanghai market comprises solely domestic manufacturers, and every product has undergone strict vetting. I believe this exhibition should fulfill three meanings:</p>
<p>(1) To reward new domestic products—not previously available—by granting special awards, encouraging manufacturers to innovate and imitate.</p>
<p>(2) To introduce and promote new domestic items or inventions within the exhibition.</p>
<p>(3) To investigate and publicize recent improvements and advances in domestic goods, awarding and praising them.</p>
<p>If the exhibition can achieve these points, it will have deep significance. Otherwise, merely displaying domestic samples yields minimal effect.</p>
<p>My impression yesterday was that the venue was too small. Housed on the second floor of the last row of shops in the new market—accessible via the left staircase—there is also a newly opened “Apricot Blossom Village Teahouse,” which fortunately has been doing brisk business since its opening. The exhibition hall lies just beyond a small door, but stalls are cramped and each manufacturer has only a tiny display area.</p>
<p>Displays consist of each firm’s products arrayed in custom showcases, with rental rates fixed at 20 yuan for the upper tier, 30 yuan for the middle, and 10 yuan for the lower. A full‑suite showcase rents for 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Among the exhibits, medicines predominate, followed by knitted goods, cotton textiles, rubber products, silverware, undergarments, stationery, ropes and belts, electrical appliances, oil stoves, soaps, and more. This is indeed an excellent way to appraise domestic samples—but regrettably, the items are only for display; they cannot be sold or handled.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope future exhibitions can secure larger venues, widely solicit domestic samples, and clearly mark price comparisons with imported goods, so buyers recognize domestic products’ genuine affordability.</p>

<p>One must first have a sequence of steps. For example, in chess: what is the first move, what is the second move, what is the third move—there is a definite order.</p>
<p>To deal with such a sequence, one also needs a set method: how to counter the first move, how to counter the second, how to counter the third. If you face circumstances without a fixed procedure, the result is bound to be failure.</p>
<p>It is like tuberculosis: if you do not seek treatment in the first or second stage, once it reaches the third stage—even if Hua Tuo were revived—there would be no remedy.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Sketch of a Fountain Pen Hospital <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Xinliang</p>
<p>Is your fountain pen broken? No—do you mean it’s sick?</p>
<p>Right now in Shanghai, there is an establishment called the Fountain Pen Hospital. Inside are many “physicians” who will examine your pen in great detail for any ailments. If there is even the slightest hope of recovery, their diagnosis and treatment will be as thorough as possible.</p>
<p>A pen with a mild “disease,” once brought in for treatment, can be returned to its owner on the spot. But if the condition is more serious, there is the hassle of “hospitalization,” lasting anywhere from a day up to a week.</p>
<p>The cluster of fountain pen hospitals is located around the Commercial Press on Henan Road: there, readers will find many shops specializing in fountain-pen repair. Before the war, near the South City Animal Shelter, there was also a large-scale pen hospital; besides that, there were several more at the West Gate.</p>
<p>At present, the most fully equipped and largest establishment is the “Fountain Pen Hospital” near the Commercial Press. On its signboard is prominently painted a red cross; those who do not know any better might truly believe it is a medical clinic.</p>
<p>The doctors at the pen hospital say, “We can treat any disease related to fountain pens.” They also claim they can take a pen that is totally unusable and turn it into a new, splendid fountain pen. Although this boast is somewhat exaggerated, it is undeniable that they can indeed repair pens that are slightly damaged.</p>
<p>“Our workmanship is very honest,” said an assistant at one hospital when I asked him. “No matter what kind of pen is brought in for repair, we only charge a very modest service fee.”</p>
<p>Casually, he then took out a pen and proudly said, “These pens are all brand-new. Many people think we only sell secondhand goods, but they’re mistaken. This is a proper shop—just like in a large corporation—you can get a very good pen here.”</p>
<p>“These are the old pens,” the clerk continued, taking out some used fountain pens. “We gather these secondhand pens from various places, give them proper repairs, and then sell them at low prices.” He told me that due to the rise in foreign exchange rates, these older pens are not particularly cheap. Generally, two empty-barrel Parker pens sell for around thirty to thirty-five yuan.</p>
<p>At the same time, the fountain pen hospitals also sell nibs. Ordinary ones go for about fifty cents apiece; slightly better ones range from one yuan up to ten yuan.</p>
<p>When they repair a pen, they first use a magnifying glass to inspect the nib for cracks; if cracks are found, they will inform you immediately that the nib must be replaced. Otherwise, after repair, it would be hard to please the customer.</p>
<p>“A good fountain pen lasts forever,” the clerk continued. “So when you are choosing a pen, you must pay attention and avoid buying inferior models that have been superficially altered.”</p>
<p>“Poor-quality pens usually have two defects: either the feed cannot draw ink, or they leak. A good fountain pen will never leak.”</p>
<p>Walk along Nanjing Road or Henan Road and you will likely encounter friends trying to sell you what look like new, high-quality pens. The prices really are cheap, but I advise you not to be deceived by this bargain. A pen that looks fine but works poorly will frighten you when you use it. Once it breaks, and you bring it to the Fountain Pen Hospital, the “doctors” there may refuse to “admit” such a “patient.” Wouldn’t that be a waste of your money?

<h3 id="e134">Red “Blue” Film and the Three Primary Colors <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Renzhi</p>
<p>The Soviet film “The Woman Warrior” is a color motion picture made using red, “blue,” and the three primary colors. After its release, it received unanimous acclaim among critics. However, regarding its color achievements, some have raised objections. Here, I wish to offer some principles I’ve read in books for reference. I hope not to be mocked as an “expert” and have my sincere teaching enthusiasm chilled.</p>
<p>Color can be divided into light color and pigment color. Sunlight contains waves of varying length. The display of the seven colors is due to these differing wavelengths. White light passing through a red filter appears red. The reason is that only red wavelengths can pass through the red filter, thus appearing red. Since equal parts of red (Red), blue (Blue), and green (Green) light combine to form white light, red, blue, and green are usually called the three primary colors of light. This differs from the three primary pigment colors.</p>
<p>Speaking of light colors, equal parts of blue and green mix to form cyan (blue-green). Two parts cyan mixed with one part red also form white. What we call red “blue” here is cyan. We can see that the colors achievable from three primaries can also be produced from two primaries, though the proportions differ and the process is more cumbersome. In fact, red and blue mix into yellow; red and green into magenta; using yellow and green or magenta and blue as primaries can also yield the same results.</p>
<p>The coloration of objects corresponds to pigment color. If an object absorbs green wavelengths but reflects red and blue, it appears yellow. If it absorbs red but reflects blue and green, it appears cyan. If it absorbs blue but reflects green and red, it appears magenta. Therefore, when shooting a yellow object with a three-primary-color camera, the red and blue negatives will retain the image while the green negative shows none. With a red-“blue”-primary camera, both the red and “blue” (cyan) negatives will show the image, but in different proportions. When projecting these two sets of film back, in theory they should yield identical color results. This shows that, in terms of color proportioning, two primaries are more challenging than three. In the shooting process, two primaries are simpler than three. In any case, the fact that the Soviet Union has achieved its current success in filming with two primaries cannot but be considered quite successful and worthy of admiration.</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: The Wise Woman in a Skirt, the Honorable Mother; The Silver-Bearded Elder in Green Sleeves, the Energetic Senior</p>
<p>He Shuangyu asked, “Why do some things require approval and others not?” Zhu the Village Chief replied, “There are various considerations that cannot be exhaustively explained in a moment. The establishment of any factory must suit the local conditions; our village too must undergo a round of review. For example, the two young ladies planning to open a silk-weaving mill would surely pass. Many villages here engage in sericulture, producing considerable raw silk each year. Raw silk and silk fabrics are inevitably closely connected.</p>
<p>Although in recent years our country’s raw silk exports have ranked first in the world, domestic demand remains strong. I recall eight or nine years ago during the war, Japanese raw silk exports plummeted, and our own sericulture also suffered. Provinces across our nation vigorously promoted silkworm breeding; provinces that had never done so began rearing silkworms, yet still could not make up for the shortfall in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The United States was the first to worry; using scientific methods, they invented various types of rayon, but it could never match the quality of natural silk.</p>
<p>After the war, our silk industry boomed; America, the Soviet Union, and European and American countries all wanted our silk. Our raw silk leapt to first place in world exports. For the sake of postwar frugality, domestic consumption of silk fabrics has decreased. However, our shortcoming is that we export few finished luxury goods. Now, the two young ladies plan to establish a textile mill to sell fabrics abroad, which is a further step forward.”</p>
<p>He Nongyu said, “We’re not certain we can handle foreign trade. But our father has several old friends in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who support us. They know we, his nieces, studied textiles in America and have some knowledge, so they suggested we give it a trial. Consider: countries that don’t produce silk import raw silk to manufacture finished goods for export. We, as a silk-producing nation close to the source, why can’t we make fabrics and sell them worldwide? Since Jiangsu and Zhejiang are raw-silk provinces, and their silk fabrics are renowned, we want to set up our mill there. This is a new village organized by our grandfather’s efforts, and it is our mother’s hometown; we wish to establish our foundation here. We ask grandfather to help and guide us.”</p>
<p>Zhu the Village Chief said, “Another factory here would surely enrich the locality. We are certainly willing for your mill to be established here. After dinner, let us take a look. If it seems suitable, we will present it to the village council.” (113)</p>

<h3 id="e136">Success of American Television Films (Continued) <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>This summer you can enjoy movies without leaving home; high prices, however, may prevent widespread adoption</p>
<p>(3) Research Advances</p>
<p>Once a method is established, those studying television film naturally focus on cathode-ray research, which is precisely what is currently in use. In addition, in contrast to this type of television film, there is the Wilhelmy voplays vibroacoustic mirror: by mounting a camera and a dry plate (similar to a photographic dry plate) on a cathode-ray tube. This dry plate is coated with countless light-sensitive cells, onto which the image is focused. A sheet of cathode rays scans this plate line by line, quickly transmitting the image. The actions of the camera and the receiver are perfectly synchronized, sending and receiving the same images multiple times. One oscillation is vertical, the other horizontal. Using this method, films must have 441 lines to transmit images repeatedly. During transmission, audio is also sent through a sound channel, and at the receiving end, various signals must be separated and amplified.</p>
<p>(4) High Cost of Equipment</p>
<p>Since the machinery is so complex, both the transmitter and receiver cost far more than ordinary wireless broadcast or radio sets. In this situation, the screen size must be appropriate, and a good receiver produces an image at least seven by eight inches, requiring a large cathode-ray tube—which is very expensive. Roughly, each set costs between US$350 and $500. If you insist on spending less, you can only view a smaller film of roughly three by four inches, priced at about $150 to $200 per set. Currently, cheaper receivers are not yet available. Large cathode-ray tubes require strong protective measures. Films must be limited to high-current operation to avoid accidents; yet due to spontaneous arcing and heat conduction, “snowflakes” may appear on the screen. Ultimately, one must use 200 lines instead of 441, which becomes a significant issue for television film. Nevertheless, engineers generally remain optimistic, believing these minor issues are easily resolved. It is said that once cathode-ray television films become popular, these problems can be solved within a few years. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e137">The New Plan for the New Rooftop Garden <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>

<p>Creating a Hollywood-Style Glass Broadcasting Studio; Adding a Garden Restaurant, Theatrical Venue; Cancelling the International Dance Hall to Open a Shopping Mall</p>
<p>Shanghai’s amusement venues can stay packed year-round because their founders use extremely low ticket prices and local operas from various provinces to attract Shanghai’s diverse population. This strategy has, of course, been highly effective.</p>
<p>Take the Dajie World, the New World, and other companies’ venues—aren’t they full all year? Yet since the Nationalist forces’ westward retreat, these venues, to draw customers, have slashed prices to rock-bottom. Dajie World’s highest ticket is now only two dimes (and you get one ticket free for each purchase); the New World venue charges as little as five cents—truly as cheap as it gets.</p>
<p>“But because the big companies’ venues are so scattered and cheap, their revenues haven’t matched past levels. To address this, they’ve decided to change strategy and aim for the upscale market—hence, the New Rooftop Garden.</p>
<p>Those not following amusement-venue news closely may not have noticed the New Rooftop Garden’s recent closure. In fact, it has been closed for many days.</p>
<p>Simultaneously ceasing business was the New Company’s International Dance Hall. Now let me separately discuss the New Rooftop Garden’s future plan.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xiao Zongjun, head of the New Company, they have decided to dismantle the former New Rooftop Garden venue and, with higher ticket prices, attract an upscale audience.</p>
<p>His plan is as follows: on the company’s sixth floor, they intend to spend sixty thousand yuan renovating into the following new entertainment spaces:</p>
<p>(1) Glass-Covered Broadcasting Studio—Shanghai’s studios have never invested heavily in building glass enclosures; if at all, we’ve only seen such facilities in Hollywood films. Now they have decided to construct such an elaborate glass studio, in which broadcasting inside is fully visible from the outside.</p>
<p>(2) Sound Film Theater—in cooperation with the New China Company, exclusively screening New China’s second-run films.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai Opera Theater—Xiao Wenbin has been engaged for long-term performances.</p>
<p>(4) Shaoxing Literary Opera—no troupe has been finalized, but they plan to hire Shanghai’s top performers.</p>
<p>(5) Garden Restaurant—located just outside the glass studio, serving Western cuisine with air-conditioning in hot weather.</p>
<p>Ticket prices for the venues are set at fifty and eighty cents, with all seating brand-new. They expect to open by the end of June at the latest.</p>
<p>Given the success of the Lvbao Theater, this upscale strategy will likely ensure victory.</p>
<p>Regarding the dance hall: there was originally a plan to set up an open-air rooftop dance floor, but due to various complications, it has been cancelled.</p>
<p>The former site of the International Dance Hall will be converted into the New Company’s shopping mall. Henceforth, the International Dance Hall will be but a memory.</p>

<p>Insured for One Million Gold Dollars</p>
<p>In Hollywood, the star Diana Dou Ping is undoubtedly the most prominent. Her acting is truly admirable; her singing is even better. She is now one of New Universal’s principal stars. Several songs she sings in The Full Courtyard Blossoms, when played in cinemas and then in dance halls (on wind instruments), have become wildly popular among the masses: also hits are films like “Little Bird Clinging to the Man,” “Adolescent Blossom,” and “Phoenix at Dawn,” which draw sold-out audiences in major world cities. Actually, Dou Ping is only sixteen and cannot yet be considered a fully mature star. Everyone believes she has a very bright future. New Universal’s management is extremely attentive to her voice and has recently signed a contract with a New York insurance company to insure Dou Ping’s voice for one million dollars, the same amount as insured for Shirley Temple’s voice. Such luxury among film stars is indeed an unrivaled spectacle.</p>

<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>After tea and wine, plucking the strings and singing is a joyful affair. Performing onstage brings further delight, but there are hidden bitter aspects that outsiders don’t know. For instance, if you can play but not very well, people may invite you to perform, not because of your skill but to save money. You, thinking it a chance to show off, don’t realize that once you step onstage, you are immediately criticized. Whispers and gossip fly around the venue; you end up sweating but accomplishing nothing. What a pity!</p>
<p>If you are truly skilled, Zhang San invites you today, Li Si tomorrow, and then you have rehearsals and guest performances every day. If you accept them all, you’ll be overstretched; if you refuse, everyone calls you ungrateful. And if you frequently take the stage, bystanders think you’re a local celebrity.</p>
<p>Home practice is best, but playing the erhu requires it to be set up, and in the biting north wind, only the higher notes sound; the low ones are gone. Also, applying rosin makes a dreadful mess; changing strings risks chipping your teeth—none of which is pleasurable. Now, in Shanghai, with so many people overcrowding, five or six families share a house, so you can’t practice quietly. In the morning, third-floor sisters won’t allow practice before noon. In the afternoon, the auntie next door naps. At night, from ten to eleven is the Ministry of Works’ regulation; if you go overtime, you get fined. Should we cause trouble by playing “too much,” or not?</p>
<p>Then there’s budgeting: a yuan a month for rent, plus the horse fare to Beiping, plus mail and remittance fees. Asking friends to bring rosin is a favor; and you must get snake-skin [rosin cases]. Without three or four instruments you’re busy all day.</p>
<p>Those aren’t the only woes. If you discover a new fine instrument, you can’t help buying it—then one this year, two next year. Soon, dozens of unwanted useless instruments crowd your home. Counting erhu cases alone, new and old, I have thirty-nine. If I travel, I can’t carry them all and must check baggage.</p>

<p>The Peony Troupe Announces Accounts: To demonstrate trust and transparency to all members, the Chinese Peony National Theater Troupe leadership announces its accounts. The gross income from the China-Philippines Theater was 52,161.8 yuan, half of which—26,080.09 yuan—belongs to the troupe. The troupe’s total expenses were 25,126.9 yuan, leaving a net surplus of 953.99 yuan. However, allowances for members’ losses and other miscellaneous expenses incurred over four months before leaving Shanghai cost more than that, so the nine-hundred-yuan surplus was far from sufficient.</p>
<p>Jinxin Company to Manage the New Theater: The performance stage will be taken back by Pang Laichen for private management, forming the Jinxin Entertainment Company with Dong Yongjun, with all preparations actively underway. It is rumored they will hire the famous Dan Dan Xun Huisheng for performances in the South.</p>
<p>Uncertainty Over Li Zhonglin’s Southward Tour: Recently, rumors have circulated that the veteran Wenwu performer Li Zhonglin has been invited to the South to join the Thirty-Two-Episode Red Lotus Temple. A reporter, visiting backstage manager Chen Yuelou, asked about this matter, and he emphatically denied it. Li’s representative, Mr. Guo Chunpu, also said he had heard nothing of it.</p>
<p>Zhu Cuimei Comes to Shanghai to Recuperate: Kun Dan performer Zhu Cuimei and her husband Zheng Zuan traveled to Shanghai; their goods were bombed en route, suffering heavy losses, nearly leading to bankruptcy. She now plans to rest in Shanghai for two to three months; if unable to join a troupe, she will head north to seek further training. Her mother, originally from Linchuan County, Jiangxi, has already fled to Lichuan County.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two Noteworthy Stories About the Late Actor Luo Kuifang</p>
<p>He said, “Since I came south, I suddenly discovered a young sheng named Li Guifang whose performance is excellent. His style is very upright; with that role, in Beijing one could not find his equal—(apart from the more senior Zhu Suyun and Cheng Jixian). Later I learned he was a late apprentice of Yang Rongshou, and thus a junior brother to Jixian, which explains his ability. Today, upon hearing a single line, one sees your skill is uncommon. Among the Tan school of bearded sheng, you are at the forefront. You and Guifang are both talents I chanced upon in the south.” After he finished speaking, they coaxed Bao Zhong to perform a segment of “Scolding Cao” in its original style, with Hong Shou accompanying on the qin. The four lines were completed with difficulty. It was truly unappetizing—call the small trick a grand spectacle! Young Chen and Young Yang, sitting to one side, saw everyone sympathizing with Bao Zhong and expressing goodwill; he then walked up to him, sat beside him, clasped his hand, calling him “big brother” repeatedly, leaving everyone bewildered. After the two bid farewell, they asked Little Bao, who explained that Bao Zhong addressed him as “big brother” in reference to Lord Wang (Yaoying), whose wife was Bao Zhong’s aunt. Initially, Little Bao studied dan roles under Yaoying before switching to sheng roles. Due to that connection, Bao Zhong felt it appropriate to call him “big brother.” Actually, Bao Zhong and Shuyan are of the same generation; if Bao Zhong were to call him anything, it should have been “senior brother.” Then Young Yang would have had to address him more respectfully. (Little Bao died in the 14th year of the Republic at only forty; he would now have been fifty-four, perhaps a year or two older than Shuyan.) In his early dan days, he had an extremely beautiful stage presence and great reputation; then, in a sudden fit of anger, he switched to sheng roles—a story with much to tell, revealing him as a man of integrity. Also, there is one notable act of righteousness that could compare, one after the other, with Judge Di in “The Widow Ma Opens a Shop.” Hence I wish to specially commend him. The two stories are entitled: “Embarrassed at Being a Senior Actor’s Plaything, He Switched Masters in Anger to Forsake Dan for Sheng” and “Refusing to Tarnish His Reputation after Fracturing His Brow Bone, He Feigned Insanity to Rescue Another.” (15)</p>
