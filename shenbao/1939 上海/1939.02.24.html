<h3 id="c11">社評　敎育難民 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>「救濟難民要敎養並重」，這是一句極平常的話，也可以說得是救濟工作的至理名言。</p>
<p>過去一年七個月的救濟工作，雖然不能說已經做到盡善盡美，但是總算做得差强人意，允其是難民敎育一項更著勞績，試看上海紅十字會敎育委員會發表的統計數字：</p>
<p>「上海難民最多的時候的十四萬九千七百人，學齡兒童共有三萬二千九百四十八人，已受難敎之兒童達二萬七千九百四十八人，受敎成人有二萬二千七百八十七人，敎師合計五百八十人，其中義務敎師爲三百零二人，每月經費約二千元。」</p>
<p>從這個統計表裏，我們知道有百分之七十以上的難童，百分之五十的成人難民受了難民敎育。這樣大的受敎育的百分數，在中國平時敎育裹也不容易做到，這是很値得稱頌者一。難民敎師薪給最多者每月只有八元，與難民同食宿，而義務敎師的數目竟超過一半，這些敎師大都是靑年學生，不取報酬，爲難民服務，這是値得稱頌者二。難民敎育經費每人每月不滿四分，這四分錢是包括紙筆書和敎師薪水，如此省錢的敎育，是最適宜於辦難民敎育，這點也値得注意。</p>
<p>上海還有難民嗎？有！有！有！至少還有十萬人，有的住在收容所裘，有的露宿街頭。這些難民是吾應該繼續施以適當的敎育呢？當然應該的！所以我們不但希望主持難民敎育者繼續辦曾經辦過的敎育，更希望注意下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一注意生產敎育　救濟難民不但應該提倡富有者養活難民，更應該設法使難民養活自己。一個人怎樣能夠養活自已，最重要的是要有一技之長。所以提倡難民的技術敎育，早早有人注意。但是技術有各種不同的技術，我們希望難民學得的技術是生產技術，是能夠增加國富的生產技術。這樣不但難民個人可以養活自己，對於國家社會，也有很大的利益。</p>
<p>第二注意精神訓練　流離失所的難民，不但身體上受到痛苦，物質上受到損失，最主要的還是精神上的痛苦。精神上的痛苦必須有極正確的救濟，不然，前途不堪設想。怎樣實施上海難民精神敎育呢？這裹有八個字可以貢獻：「愛國愛鄉，精誠團結」。在消極方面使難民們認淸此次落難的眞正原因，絕對不對中央政府發生怨恨；在積極方面精誠團結爲國家民族謀獨立平等與自由。難民倘能受到這樣敎育，那末一旦回鄉，也是一員極有用的國民。</p>
<p>第三注意發動專門家大學生中學生及熱血靑年共同去敎育難民　過去一般人士出錢救濟難民，確實盡了相當責任，靑年人士出力敎育難民，也盡了相當力量。但是難民還有十萬，不但繼績需要物質救濟，更需要加緊敎育。誰來貢擔這個責任呢？上海聚彙着很多專門家大中學生以及一般熱血靑年，這許多人員，都是難民敎育中最主要的角色。因此，希望上海成千成萬的專門家大中學生熱血靑年，自動的起來敎育難民；至於正在敎育難民的人員，更應該再來發動親友們從事難民敎育。</p>
<p>第四注意指導難民敎育自己　我們知道難民住在收容所裹是暫時的，終究要散去或回鄉去的。所以難民敎育與普通學校敎育或民衆敎育稍稍有些不同，其中最不同的一點，就是要在最短時期內給難民永久的敎育。這件工作乍看起來是很困難的，以爲敎育萬能了。其實呢？只要敎育者指導難民發揮自動的能力，能夠自己敎育自己，能夠用集體來敎育自已，那末敎育者在某一時期內雖然敎不了多少，但是受敎者所得到的是一輩子也受用不盡的。所以今後考察難民敎育成績，除直接考察所敎的材料以外，允其要考察難民自己敎育自己的能力。</p>
<p>第五注意發現難民中天才分子　難民羣中有很多技術人才，這是大家都知道的，難民羣中，更有很多天才，允其是具有天才的難童，這件事近來也漸有人注意。天才兒童或成人，都是國家民族天生成的優秀分子，我們倘若設法去發現出來，更施以極有效的天才敎育，這就是替國家民族培植不少國力。所以難民羣好比一座礦山，主持敎育者必須在礦山中找尋各種有用的礦料出來。這件工作說來雖近迂遠，其實貫也是一件建國的根本工作。</p>
<p>發動上海四百萬市民的慈悲惻隱之心，必定可以養活棲留上海的十萬難民；發動上海成千成萬的敎育者與熱心人士，也一定可以敎育上海十萬難民成爲國家民族極有用的人才。這個願望，本報當追隨全上海人士共同努力。</p>

<p>（續前日）事實產生需要、艱苦的抗戰已經造成了不少的進步、這不但中正個人感到興奮、愛國的同胞們必然覺得這是復興民族必由的大道、</p>
<p>從今以後、要更進一步的配合國家現實的情况、發揚我們民族潛在的力量、使新生活運動成爲爭取抗戰勝利的武器、成爲策進建國成功的原動力、我們怎麼樣來作進一步的努力呢、我們要認識新生活運動倡始時候的本旨、我們更要檢討我們國家今天的環境、我在五年前倡導新生活、主旨是要恢復我們民族廉恥、準備國家有了敵國外侮的時候、皆能負責任、守紀律、發揮我民族同仇敵愾、同舟共濟、禦侮爭存的能力、換句話說、這個新生活、就是軍隊生活、就是戰時生活、各位同胞更要知道、這戰時生活實在就是現代生活、因爲現在時代無論個人或社會、不是實行戰時生活就不能存在、就要被人淘汰滅亡、</p>
<p>現在我們自七七以來、受暴敵擴大侵略、巳經一年有半、我們的抗戰已進第二期、巳經到了决定成敗存亡的重要關頭、我們必須衝突這最後一關、消減殘暴的敵人、實現我們的最後勝利而後我們　有光榮的生存、　有安樂的生活、我們國家旣然處在這樣重要的非常時期、新生活運動也就跟着抗戰建國的進程、進到一個新的重要階段、因之我們個人的生活規律和整個的民族精神、也須有進一步的表現、本來新運的精神建築在「禮義廉恥」之上、表現於「衣食住行」之中、其中許多含義和表現方法在新生活運動綱要裏面、指示巳極詳明、不必再加解釋、不過到了現在、由於我們抗戰的形勢、一般國民生活的狀態都已經起了很大的變化、那麼我們精社發揚和表現的方式自然也應該有更具體更積極的姿態出來、必須這種運動的精神恰恰能够和抗戰建國的實際需要互相配合、才能够達成我們應負的使命、我現在要爲我們同胞講明抗戰期中國民生活規律應有的意義、</p>
<p>第一先就「禮」字來講、原來解釋是「規規炬炬的態度」、但到現在、就應該山規規矩炬的態度進爲嚴嚴整整的紀律、因爲抗戰建國的進程中是紀律重於一切、我們在平時固然要注意個人生活態度的整飭、在戰時更需要運行國民安守的紀律、不如此就不能造成共同一致的力量、醫如及齡壯丁應服兵役、這是國家頒行法令的有形紀律、歡送出征軍人和敬愛受傷將士並且爲之服務、這是社會公認的無形紀律、凡是中華民國的國民都必須一致遵行的態度、才算合乎規炬、才能適應國家的需要、我們禮經上說的「臨難母苟全」、這是禮的極致、在戰時遵行國家一切的法令、絕對不顧私人的利害、纔算不背乎「禮」、</p>
<p>第二再就「義」字來講、原本解釋是「正正當當的行爲」、但到現在、就應該由正正當常的行爲進爲「慷慷慨慨的犧牲」、武裝同志在戰塲上奮勇殺敵、和各地同胞踴躍從軍、自然是慷慨犧牲、此外凡是輸財報國、應微工作、以及戰區同胞破壞自己的工廠、焚燬自積的糧食、廿受損失、不肯拱手資敵等等、也是極端慷慨犧牲行爲、這是「義」的高度表現、</p>
<p>第三再就廉字來講、原本解釋是「淸淸楚楚的辨別」、到現在就應該由淸淸楚楚的辨別進爲「實實在在的節的」、因爲現代戰爭完全是人力物力總和的决賽、誰的經濟物質能够持久供給、就是誰獲最後勝利、所以不但對於公款公物、應該絕對愛惜、不可有絲毫的浪費、或幾微的侵佔、就是各個人的財物、以至荒野無主的一草一木、我們也應該一樣的切實愛惜、不容任意消耗、才可以多多培養我們的國力、這「節約」二字的本義、原來是要我們每一個人厲行節儉省的、做到儉以養廉、的以濟物的程度、但我們更可推而廣之、解釋爲「節制」私人的慾望、「約束」自己的身心、絕對不做妨害國家耗損國力的舉動、這在抗戰必勝建國必成的前途上是一個極重要的條件、第四再講到「恥」字、原本解釋是「切切實實的覺悟」、到現在就應該由切切實實的覺悟進爲「轟轟烈烈的奮鬥」、這一個意義更爲明顯、醫如我們覺悟到抗戰需要最急切的是兵員補充、就親自應徵、或將子弟送去服役、或者覺悟到前方將士缺乏某項物品、馬上就出來宜傳捐助、並且首先樂捐、以做榜樣、凡是有一種覺悟、就有一種轟轟烈烈的表現、孔子說過「知恥近乎勇」、這個知字、常然就是覺悟的意思、這個勇字當然就是轟轟烈烈奮鬥的道理、必須如此、　算眞有覺悟、　算眞能知恥的現代公民、</p>
<p>我們再把上面所說的「禮義廉恥」四種、更進一層的意義、總括起來、換做一句話來談、就是每一個人必須能够明暸抗戰建國的需要、忠勇奮發、去力行自身應盡的責任、不惜任何艱苦、不避任何犧牲、在嚴整的紀律之下、造成全國普遍廣大的風氣、從我們各個人衣食住行乃至於從公服務、一切生活中都循着這四種最高準則、切實表現出來、我們在戰時一切的行動、必須守紀律、負責任、明公私、尙力行、而在國家民族利益上、絕對的不惜犧牲、這就是禮義廉恥四字在戰時生活上的解釋、我們必須明暸個人的生活和行動、却是和國家利害與社會風氣不能分離、處處切實省察事實、認淸是非、　勉奮發、躬行實踐、纔能够克服當前的艱危、完成抗戰建國的工作、</p>
<p>此外有一種重要的意義、我們提倡新運、是要從改善衣食住行的生活、達到軍事化、生產化、合理化三種的功效、所以改善生活精神、只是一種方法、而達成軍化事生產化合理化的效用、纔是我們最終的目的、新運經過的歷史、已經有五年了、我們國家民族史是在存亡呼吸的關頭、要殺敵衛國、需要國民一切生活合於戰事的要求、要充實國力、需要國民一切勞力都供獻於戰時經濟的建設、要在抗戰進程中奠定建國的基礎、就需要國民由散漫自私的奮生活、進到合羣互助的公民生活、所以我們現在推行新運、一方面要從各個人的生活上、積極擴張軍事化、生產化、合理化的精神、一方面對於國家社會直接促成軍事化、生產化等等的事業、更需要全國同胞本勞動服務的精神、人人積極參加、共同努力、舉幾個例來說、第一譬如現在各方壯丁訓練、凡是適合這種訓練年齡人、無論是何身份、都應該自動去受訓、第二醫如各地方政府的編查保甲人員移動一項、向來辦得最不切實、即由各地同胞不肯自動出力、以致不能嚴密、從今以後、無論何人、都應該共同帮助保甲長去做這兩種民衆組訓事務、都是「軍事化」的重要工作、克復敵人、淸除奸諜、完全以此爲基礎、第三我最近所發吿全國士紳及敎育界人士書裏面所說的、提倡各項小手工業和開發各地的經濟建設、不但要各盡才能、智力去提倡、尤其應該督率家人婦孺、以餘時餘力躬行實踐、第四中央現在對西南西北各省經濟交通、各種建設事業、正在分頭加緊推進、當然需要許多人力財力的贊助、各地同胞都應該盡量呈獻資本技術和能力、一致踴躍參加、這兩項都是我們「生產化」最重要的綱目、全國同胞必須澈上澈下共同努力以赴、要知道我們現在抗戰、固然要盡量增加生產以充實我們必須的補給、更要明白我們將來抗戰勝利實現了經過這次長期大戰以後、許多的企業機關遭受了暴敵破壞、許多同胞的身家廬舍遭受了暴敵摧殘、那時候我們全民族的生活、必將愈加艱難困苦、要克復這種未來的困苦、尤靠我們今天提早的準備、事先的努力、總而言之、我們要挽救國家民族當前的危難、惟有立刻實現我們軍事化·生產化·合理化的生活、這又是當前新生活運動一個最迫切的要求、諸位同胞、凡是一個現代的國家、必有一種特殊的立國精神、新生活運動、就是我們立國精神的重建、禮義廉恥是國家的四維、軍事化·生產化·合理化是我們民族共同生活的基準、我們把握着這兩個要點、同心一德、奮勇前進、把我們一切的生活行爲、都緊張起來、今年是我們新運的進步年、大家要在這一年中策進我們的戰時生活、提高我們抗戰力量、充分表現我們奮鬥犧牲的精神、爲我們具有五千年歷史文化的民族、創造未來光輝的新生命、（十八日電）</p>

<p>（東京）東京現遭煤炭荒、據該業中人聲稱、今雖付較兩月前高三倍之價格、亦不能獲得來源、其原因爲（一）日本北部近有大風雪、致北海道礦中產品不能運出、（二）日海軍當局因日蘇之漁業爭端已使兩國關係瀕於危急地位、故已徴發煤斤所有之來源、（三）造謠者謂日艦隊現正集中北部海面、準備應付一切事變、但無論孰爲實在之原因、而東京許多家庭已入棄夜浴之習慣、或改行冷水浴、甚至家庭取煖用之煤炭、亦極難購得、（二十一日路透電）</p>

<p>祝君健康并永獲幸福</p>
<p>照理，結婚生活是可以增進健康的，因爲身心上獲得了調濟，精神上也得到了歡樂。歡樂在我們的健康上是多麼的有益呀！俗諺說：『大笑三聲，力長千斤』。又說：『氣氣惱惱生了病，快快樂樂活了命』。因爲歡樂足以促進我們的消化作用，血液的循環功能，尤其能助長我們的新陳代謝機能，所以一個健壯的男子，如果遲婚，反會在生理上發生障碍，因爲生活的過於寂寞，精神上每發生不快，是以在神經系統即有病態表現，要是結了婚，這種現象就可逐漸的消滅而成健全狀態，所以醫家說：遲婚與獨生都是不甚相宜的。并在生物學上的研究，我們知道有種動物因爲得不到配偶而竟至死亡！然而在目今的事實上有着很多的親戚朋友鄰居以及一般的病家，大都因爲結婚而喪失了健康，而尤其是中年的丈夫。這種人最普遍的病象，是神經衰弱症，有的大腦神經非常的衰弱，時有腦脹頭痛，耳鳴眼花，健忘失眠等現象；有的脊髓神經衰弱，時有腰酸背痛，四肢酸軟，稍一操勞，即覺疲備非常；有的性神經衰弱，時有遺精，或竟至滑精漏精，腎虧無能，精力渙散等症，此外如貧血體瘦，驟然發胖，乍寒乍熱，夜眠盜汗，心悸膽怯，怕寒畏熱，遇事退縮等現象者亦間或有之，此種男子，不特在事業上因不能繼續努力，常一敗墮地，或竟可惜地功虧一簣！就是在夫婦間性生活上，亦常感覺無能爲力，是以爲妻不滿而生家庭的糾紛，近來社會上時有所聞的妻與人私通私奔，或竟公然請求仳離者，其大半原因即在於此。這是何等悲慘的事！男子何以於婚後體弱無能？據醫家的論斷，大都因早年有自凟遺精，或婚後荒淫縱慾，或因生活壓迫過勞斵傷致精枯血竭，神經陷於衰弱之故，唯一補救瓣法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均公認服生殖素制劑「生殖素」，最爲症而特效。誠以此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，并可使身體益增健康，惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速！若患者如能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後施用電療，注射及其他對症療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>○欲求健美與多情的女郎，切不可忽略了你們的乳峯○我們在醫學上的論斷，乳峯發育的良好必要根據於卵巢機能的健全，這種機能健全，在體態方面，最顯著的就是乳峯高聳起來，乳頭是紫檀色，猶如椎形的塔頂上的塔尖。在胸際雙峯並峙，中間是幽深狀態，似在引人入勝。至於感情方面，亦固性機能發達的影響，常優柔，快樂，敏感而多情，所以女乳性峯不特在形態的健美上有價值與內在的感情亦大有關係。因此，歐美婦女，爲欲表明其健美與多情，對於乳峯發育，常加意維護，如有不甚滿意之處，即服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，以爲培補，使其充分發育。可是我們回顧中國婦女，對於乳峯一項，素不注意，甚有束胸而使其萎癟，此實不合理之至！至於因月經不調，白帶不感等陷病，摧殘了卵巢機能，致乳癟顏衰，未老先衰等現象者，那更比比皆是。是以在中國家庭中常致夫婦感情淡薄，貌合神離，竟有如寃家者，雖一樣的生男育女，然種族就一天天的衰弱下來了，不特他們的人生痛苦之至，且於社會國家，亦受莫大損害！唯一補救辦法，據余臨床實驗，確以服用卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，最爲對症而特效，且因國人之體格關係，可用藥較少，而收效較外人爲大，誠以此藥於服後一日夜間即能培補卵巢機能，增進新陳代謝作用，如繼續服用，則於短期內即可將上述婦女隱病完全治愈，使乳峯逐漸聳起面頰經潤，增進健美，在夫婦間更發生充分的愛情。欲求健美而多情的女郎呀！這裏是妳們的救星！</p>

<p>淋病原是毀壞性機能之凶魔</p>
<p>有高妙手術電療始可尅日就痊</p>
<p>白濁因其病灶多在生殖系統部分，所以極易損壞性機能。壁之淋病症狀中所遇到者，以淋毒性攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，精囊炎，輸精管炎等爲多。此種器官，俱是生殖系統中占有重要位置，如報護腺液有涵養精子之功效，睪丸有製造精子之功效，精囊有貯精子之功能。輸精管有輸精授孕之功能。如有一種器官受病，則吾人之生殖機能，立即受其威脅。此等病狀，胥不能用局部手術或市上一般劣藥所能奏其全功。蓋因病菌深入內部，單靠表面之局部手術，旣不能直達病灶，形成隔靴搔養。而市上一般劣藥，有百害而無一利。因此等劣藥莫不以幾天內可以根治作號召，實際上每有傷胃傷腎之霸烈作用。因此患者要求最妥速與最澈底之治療，不得不採用德國濾淋平流電療法，使電力直接透射病灶，並濾由淋菌所產生之毒素，如此治療，始可稱爲連根拔去，並輔用手術以矯正之，則病根去而生殖機能恢復也。</p>

<p>路透社二十三日東京電、上海日大使館參贊森島、頃已向日外相有田、報告上海公共租界局勢、森島大約在一二日內、將携有田訓令、飛回上海、</p>
<p>工部局正研究內容</p>
<p>字林報云、工部局總辦斐利浦昨（二十二日）晚答覆記者詢問云、日領事曾訪工部局總董、提出與邇來公共租界內之暴舉有關之某數項抗議、局方即將研究此等抗議、而答覆日當局、此刻則未能發表言論、</p>
<p>東京所傳要求四欵</p>
<p>據東京「朝日新聞」載稱、上海公共租界中接連發生行刺「維新政府」耍人之案件以後、日本政府巳訓令日本駐滬當局、於咋日向上海公共租界工部局提出下列四種要求、（一）逮捕中國恐怖活動份子、（二）增强工部局之日本勢力、（三）增加日本警察之人數、（四）根本改組工部局、此外日本政府幷申明保留採取任何「廣泛措施」之權利、</p>
<p>日方未要求增董事</p>
<p>東京朝日新聞曾載昨日日方向工部局提出之要求、含有增加日籍董事名額、及將工部局警務處根本改組兩項、此說不確、業經工部局正式吾認、</p>
<p>日方條件透露</p>
<p>大陸報云、日軍控制區內暴徒狙擊巡捕隊後僅六小時、日陸海軍與外務省代表於咋日（二十二日）午後向工部局提出若干「要求」是項要求」之詳細性質、尙無透露、惟昨晚　日方消息聲稱、是項要求與前年十二月三日日軍於凱「旋游行時」被投彈後、日陸軍特務部向工部局提出之申請極相類、按前次申請、乃欲在公共租界警務處大量增加日籍警務人員、但未爲局方接受、昨日之要求、」乃日總領事三浦偕日本陸海軍高級軍官晤工部局總董樊克令時所提出、昨晚探悉、日方代表與樊氏巳商妥防杜公共租界復起恐怖案件之</p>
<p>工作步驟</p>
<p>昨晚日方招待各報記者時發出公報稱、鑒於上海復發恐怖暴舉、日本陸海軍與領署當局、於今日（二十二日）午後三時、向工部局總董樊克令提出書面要求、請局方同意採取對付現局之有效辦法、日方代表、拜會樊氏後、復訪英意駐軍司令官、通知向局方作要求事、發言人又云、除此公報外、渠不能加述</p>
<p>任何消息</p>
<p>日方代表未訪美防軍當局與法租界當局云、但日當局與樊氏進行會商時、竟已自取行動、武裝僞警約二十名、派駐於星加坡路距李宏濤被槍殺地不遠之處、公大紗廠正南道中亦派置僞警官、注意該地</p>
<p>近郊村鎭</p>
<p>昨日午後、警務處某高級人員到達該地時、僞警仍駐守道路兩旁、並不搜查車輛、但聞僞警前已派駐該處、此乃在租界馬路上之非法舉動、日憲兵咋亦駐守楊樹浦路、對外人與華人均施搜查、咋日本埠日文各報、對</p>
<p>意外事件</p>
<p>續予特別注意、對舉世最有效之警務組織之一的公共租界警務處警力、復指稱其無力應付局勢、且企圖辯護日軍巡邏隊入蘇州河南　爲正當之舉、警務處人員對展問之鎗擊事、似不加十分重視、謂此案絕無</p>
<p>政治性質</p>
<p>之微象、警務處意見、無不以爲現况並不若某數方面所想像之驚人、蓋去年七月份戰事紀念日、公共租界曾發生鎗擊與投彈案　約二十起之多、最近公共租界內之意外事件、唯有星期日午後南京路</p>
<p>鎗傷日人</p>
<p>一案、始與日方有關云、咋日本埠日文大陸新報刋載社論、對工部局續加猛烈抨擊、並謂局方是吾準備負「破壞東亞新秩序的基礎」之責任云、</p>
<p>日軍進駐中區不確</p>
<p>公共租界廣東路（即五馬路）外灘日淸公司、於昨晨九時半左右、突有日本軍官一名、率領武裝日兵四名、前往該處、當時兩名日兵緊隨該軍官左右、兩名即在日淸公司門首臨時站崗、惟外間不察、有誤傳日兵進駐中區情事、但該日軍官與四日兵厥後仍申原路而去、於是一團疑雲、完全消散、蓋追隨之日兵、亦僅類乎侍衛而已、惟據悉當時市塲上之股票交易竟因無稽之謠、而跌價一元、誠可謂席人自擾、無謂之至矣、</p>

<p>金澤談話妄加推測</p>
<p>海通社東京二十三日電、日本海軍省發言人金澤中將、今晨發表談話、宣稱上海反日恐怖主義者之主要目的、在摧毀中國之議和運動、第二目的在以威脅親日份子之恐怖手段、促成國共兩黨之密切口作、第三目的則在引起英國與其他國家之紛擾、金澤繼而更誣蔑上海公共租界工部局、謂工部局每次令報界對於恐怖活動、視作普通犯罪、使日本海軍省頗難相信其有澈辦恐怖份子之誠意、</p>

<p>海通社倫敦二十三日電、「泰晤士報」及「每日電聞報」今日均著社評、評論日本空軍轟炸香港領土一事、「泰晤士報」力言前日日本飛機之轟炸香港、顯然表現日本不滿英國之遠東政策、而「給予顏色、」至於日本要求擴大日本在公共租界權力一事「泰晤士報」指陳日人本身在公共租界中即組織有恐怖團體、倘工部局由日人管轄、則不出一星期、將陷於混亂狀態矣、「每日電聞報」對於香港事件、力言决不能以日空軍錯誤解釋之、至於上海方商、該報指責日本當局、不與公共租界工部局合作、取締滬西嫌疑份子、並聲言英國决不準備放棄公共租界中所存無幾之權利、</p>

<p>咳嗽原因，有外感內傷之別，症情複雜，服藥每非一二劑可愈；然若以食養治咳，則易於取效。例如（一）風熱咳，可用生蘿蔔一兩，枇杷葉二片，（去毛包）活藘根一尺去節，雪梨皮一只，煎水代茶，或加冰糖少許，更覺適口。而煮熟之蘿蔔，並可作點充飢。（二）虛熱之咳，則用上好雪梨一只，切蓋，挖去核，納入冰糖少許，飯鍋燉熱，食其汁而兼食其肉，亦頗有效。（三）痰多咳嗽者，可用甜杏仁煮為酪湯，加糖飲之，味美逾常。（四）痰熱團結不化而咳嗽者，可用陳海蟄漂淡，同鮮地栗去皮，煮服其汁，兼食地栗，亦有效。（王孟英謂雪羹湯者卽是此也）（五）肺癆虛咳，可用百合甜杏仁煮粥服，或用猪肺猪膚湯佐膳。若骨蒸內熱，可用冬蟲夏草燉鴨，兼能補虛。諸如此類，不一而足。視所見之症，定所服之品，往往取效之捷，勝於服藥。一方面宜詳列忌口食物，如辛辣炙煿之品，海味鮮發之類，皆須摒除。</p>
<h3 id="c110">烹飪之道 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 愼庵</p>
<p>烹飪之道，大別有五：曰蒸，曰煮，曰煎，曰炒，曰薰，餘若醃·醬·烤·臭霉·滷等，無非鈎心鬭角，自命新奇而己。</p>
<p>在五種烹飪法中，以蒸食之物，最合養生之道。煎炒食物，往往鍋中之油，因熱度過高而燃燒，其鮮美固在此，其火氣亦在此，健康者不宜多食，病者更忌，尤與患外症疗瘍者絕對有害。薰治食物，一般家庭中最喜自治以助餐，惟食物經過長時間之烟薰，物質己隱含火氣，偶一為之，未為不可，多食與喉管腸胃均極不相宜。烤者更與火焰直接接觸，其含火氣為尤甚，與薰治者同一有害。醃醬滷等物，大都為宿食，共尙未腐敗者，偶一為之則可。臭霉後而後食之，則為浙紹人惟一嗜好品，雖亦不失為鮮美，但與喉頭有直接妨害，脾胃薄弱者，宜擯棄之。煮食之物，水與物同時而烹，頗合家庭間日常食用，病後藉此亦合營養，惟蒸食之物，與人生生理上最為有益，以其在飯鍋內與米榖同蒸，得米穀之精華，而無共他火毒之流弊，小兒助餐，尤為相宜，食養之道，以此為最。</p>
<p>總之各種食物以新鮮為第一要義，各種菜蔬以綠色素菜為最有益，鄉人往往長壽，半得之於空氣之優良，半得之於鮮蔬之營養，而無煎炒火毒之物，以戕賊其身也，又豆腐亦為養生佳品，伍庭芳博士，其生平以豆腐一物，為日常惟一之助餐品，享壽獨高。故烹飪之法雖多而巧；總以天然食物簡單烹煮為宜。</p>
<h3 id="c111">自製藕粉 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 余香芸</p>
<p>藕產在池沼或水田中，夏季出產最多，通常都當做並不希罕的東西，豈知它對於人體的營養有着很大的功效呢！因為藕質裹有一種成分，富於收縮血管的作用，又能去瘀血，生新血，解熱毒。一般患咯血症和貧血症的人，如能常食，必可得到很大的功效。</p>
<p>但是，新鮮的藕除了夏季外，別的季節是很少的。我們可以在夏季盛產的時候，把它做成藕粉儲藏，終年服食。製法：把藕洗净，放在淘籮裹，不停手的摩擦，下面放一隻瓦鉢，使它的汁液。都源源流在瓦鉢裹；然後再把渣滓濾去，所剩下的白色濃漿沉澱洒乾，便成藕粉。吃時加以白糖，開水冲服，有養血通氣和胃等功用，病人尤其相宜。所濾出的渣滓也是很好的食料；可以和白糖做成圓子，以油煎食，香甜可口；或和以切碎的肉漿，加鹽醬油等調味品做成圓子，以油煎黃，略飾烹調，亦是很好的佐膳品。藕粉市上眞者不多，故特介紹自裂之法。</p>
<h3 id="c112">談「補脂」 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 劉民叔</p>
<p>精者，身之本也；故宜深藏，不宜外洩。吾則，易釀虛癆之疾。耗精過甚者，可用『補脂』常服，功能轉弱為强。法用胡桃仁八兩，速皮生研，黑芝蔴八兩生研，小黑豆二兩炒研，鮮猪油二斤，煎取净脂：將胡桃芝蔴黑豆諸品，納入油脂內，用箸攪勻，俟凝定後，移置陰靜處，即成『補脂。』每日晨起空腹時，取『補脂』一匙，置開水內，加鷄蛋二三枚，白沙糖不拘多少，同煮，以代點心；日日服食，功效極大。凡靑年人，淫慾過度，身體虛弱，目眩頭暈，耳嗚驚悸，皆可製服，切勿以為尋常食品而輕視之也。（附註）有痔瘡者，加柿餅四兩細切；素患便溏者，黑芝蔴微炒；胸悶氣鬱者，加金橘餅二兩細切。</p>
<h3 id="c113">婦女與肝胃病 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 葉勁秋</p>
<p>「婦人以肝為先天，」這句濫調不知創始何人，現在尙無暇考查它的來歷。但婦人多鬱怒，中懷不歡，却是事實。</p>
<p>中鄉所謂肝氣，肝陽，肝火，肝風，如其認它為實質上的肝病，便是錯誤。肝氣肝陽肝火肝風，只是神經上的某種現象而已。藥石的功效，不能超過精神上的慰藉，所以「寗治十男子，莫醫一婦人，」也是事實。先賢陳修園說得最是透澈：「婦女之症不肯對人言，與小兒之不能自言，其難治一也。醫家又未便逐細詢問，則更暗中摸索矣。大要不離中情鬱結者近是。…有心熱煩悶，如鏪如飢，懨懨倦怠，此其情竇久開，慾火內熾所致。為父母者，察知其意，速宜擇配，定期以安其心。」醫者如認定人體是無情的死機器，醫學是絕對科學論，有時要碰壁，此路不通。中醫療治肝氣病，確有獨得之秘；加味逍遙散，確是妙藥。</p>
<p>肝氣病的某一種現象，便是所謂「臟躁。」金匱婦人雜病篇曰：「婦人藏躁，喜悲欲哭，象如神靈所作，數欠伸甘麥大棗湯主之。藥用甘草三兩，小麥一升，大麥十枚。」臟病是屬於神經系統範圍的，精神一時紊亂，感覺運動分泌皆受影響。靑年女子患者較多，男子間或有之。病者的心理，或狂喜，或恐怖，或慶幸，或愛慕；有時顯現譫妄及奇異的幻覺，如見怪象，聞人聲，向空談笑等是。至於它的原因，自下尙無確定，可是與性情·思想·血少·性慾有關則已相當可靠。肝氣壅塞，往往發生胃病，允以肝氣發作病人不肯多飲食，而胃空泛酸而引成胃病者最多。所以發肝氣時餓着不吃東西，最不相宜。</p>
<h3 id="c114">黑芝麻與胡桃 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 曹錫萬</p>
<p>每値冬春，社會人士，競進補品，如參，燕，銀耳，龜鹿諸膠，固盡人皆知也。然上述種種，性味功用，各有不同，倘進服失宜，非獨不能獲益，反足以致流弊；况售價過昂，難於普遍。俗語云：「藥補不如食補」，茲有黑芝麻與胡桃，習常不甚注意，恒以零食視之，各糖食店，皆用以製成種種花色，供人消閒之用；不知此二者對於吾人營養，功效均非淺鮮，不獨冬令適宜，即四時食之亦佳。價廉物美，尤便平民購食。</p>
<p>黑芝麻　此物各處均產。性甘平。論其效用，不僅如方書所述：「能補肝腎，滋肺氣，養血，袪風，潤五臟。」而巳，屢經實騐，對於補腦，具特殊功效。吾國對於補腦之品，素付缺如，今有黑芝麻，可謂中藥補腦特效之品矣。能將此物久服，獲益必多，雖屬小品，不可忽視；惟性稍帶滑利；素患便溏及精關不固者，宜酌用。</p>
<p>胡桃　產於北方，性廿平而溫，能補氣，養血，化痰，固精，聰耳，治下部虛寒；對於溫肺，補腎，補腦之力尤著。用之於老年咳嗽，氣喘，及腰滕酸軟等症，最為適宜。然其性稍溫，肺有痰熱，命門火熾，陰虛吐衂等症不宜多食。</p>
<h3 id="c115">望病食品 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 何立三</p>
<p>倘遇至親好友，害着病，你為了心中掛念，總不免要去探望慰問，這也是人情之常。而在探望的時候，通常總要帶些食品去饋送，以表好感；其實不必，反而容易使病人吃壞。就是病人病體已愈，亦宜揀易於消化，無碍病體的食物致送。從前我有位朋友，患濕溫，經月始愈；忽然有家親戚送了幾件食品來，其中有紅燒蹄膀一物，當時見了，食指大動，就大嚼一頓。不料油膩停滯，因而復病，連性命也斷送了。所以送食品給病人，千萬要謹愼選擇，吾則愛之適以害之</p>
<h3 id="c116">杏酪湯 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 陳蔚蒼</p>
<p>杏仁有甜苦兩種，均入藥，而甜杏又可作食調羹，用途益廣。甜杏即叭達杏仁。味甘性溫平。功能潤肺止欬，下氣平喘，肺虛久嗽，殊有特效；製成杏酪，味更佳美。</p>
<p>製酪之法：用甜杏二三十粒，水浸，剝去皮尖，搗爛，加水攪和絞汁，加冰糖或葡萄糖少許，以適口為度，煮一二沸，即可飲服。氣味芳腴，色潔如乳。凡久欽及內傷虛勞欬嗽服之，滋潤枯燥，淸肅肺氣，實屬無上佳品。惟略有滑腸之弊，大便十分溏薄者宜忌。</p>
<h3 id="c117">中國發明已久之臟器療法（二） <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 謝也農</p>
<p>臟器療病，為近代醫學上最新方法，卽以畜類之臟腑器官，療治人體疾病·考之中國醫學，此法早於數百年前發明，如歷代醫籍，均載有臟器對於療病之功能，可為明蹬。惜乎後世醫者未能研究發揚，使如此良法，幾至湮沒不聞。上期已有論例，今績論之。</p>
<p>羊肝…諺云：「以肺補肺，以肝補肝」，此語實暗合科學原理，蓋用同樣之機體組織，滋補內臟，其效力自遠勝於他種藥物也。羊肝能補養肝臟，主治目疾·目與肝兩相運緊，是以補肝之藥，恒兼有明目之功·如目內生障，視物發花，病後失明等，均因肝臟液體缺少，影響視覺神經，發生變態所致，故宜多食羊肝以療之。煮肝之法，不可太老，最好煮至半熟卽食，味宜稍淡，不宜鹹，小兒赤眼，用生羊肝切薄片，井水浸五分鐘，取出貼眼皮上，數次卽愈。</p>
<p>猪肺…補人肺臟虛弱。肺虛之人，易受感冒，常引起輕微之傷風咳嗽，痰沫特多，精神萎倦，宜用猪肺·淡菜·二物合煮，當作菜肴佐餐而長食之。肺病進入嚴重階段，往往痰內夾血，或大量吐血，用猪肺淡煮，醮白芨末（國藥店有售）啖食，白芨亦能補肺，兼能止血，二者並用，收效益速。</p>

<p>人生食品，不問五穀水飲，魚肉蔬菜，一部份有益於身體，一部份有害於身體。共異於藥物者，端因味覺之甘苦，與功效略微而已，茲將養生食品，搜集數種，以供平時養生，病後調理之用，不亦宜乎？</p>
<p>（一）飴蛋漿　（製法）雞卵一枚，去壳置碗中，入嫩飴糖一匙，（俗稱净糖即麥精是也）用調蛋機（五金號有售）或竹筷攪之使起沫，喜香味者，再加檸檬汁一二點，然後取開水適量冲入，成糊漿狀，即名飴蛋漿。（効用）此漿芳香鮮甜，入口肥美而滑，頗能補養，滋潤腸胃，故宜於瘦瘠者平時攝生，及一切病後調理。</p>
<p>（二）百菓湯　（製法）用眞野百合，（形極小，味略苦，性硬，產川沙普陀沿海灘）白菓（即銀杏）同煮，加杏仁粉，文冰糖眞蜂蜜為佐，煮至白菓熟爛，即連湯取食。（効用）其味甘香而鮮，專入肺經，能補能潤，能降氣化痰，能升津養胃，可治虛癆火盛，燥欬不寗，或肺病愈後調理，或吐血减而不愈，日常服之，頗見奇功。</p>
<p>（三）黑麻酥　（製法）先取粳米炒黃，磨成粉，再用黑芝蔴炒熟，蓮心搗碎，和粉再磨，成灰色粉，然後和以適量之白糖，（須生用不必化水）一面用猪油熬油，待冷和入，但不可攙水，甜淡軟硬，均在糖油兩項，隨意伸縮之，及至適度，取印板（雕花作有售）納粉印之即成，惟貯藏須用磁陶器，吾則易走油。（効用）此酥久貯不硬，入口酥鬆，甘美香肥，確甚有味，能補脾腎，可助脂肪，有潤腸之功，無積滯之弊。宜於陰虧及中虛者，極多滋養之力，對於素患腸燥使艱，及有阿芙蓉癖或瘦瘠者，則更相宜。</p>

<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>我們時常可以聽見說，「沒有辦法。」困難或雜亂的事情固然沒有辦法，條理分明，輕而易舉的事情也是沒有辦法。此亦沒有辦法，彼亦沒有辦法，果然弄得大家沒有辦法。</p>
<p>眞的沒有辦法麼？我不相信！「挾泰山以超北海」，固然沒有辦法，「為長者折枝」，那裹是沒有辦法呢？况且「愚公移山」，「精衛塡海」，究竟也還是辦法。所謂沒有辦法，誠如孟子所說，「是不為也，非不能也！」</p>
<p>二加二等於四，在沒有發見等於四之前，二加二的等於四，本來是早已存在的。這等於四就是辦法。其他一切新發明，新發見，也都是本來早巳存在的辦法，從而可知宇宙間正有許多新的事事物物，就是早已存在的辦法，正在等待我們去發明並發見之。我們要喊沒有辦法，非但不智，簡直是不合理。若因存心沒有辦法，將最容易發明或發見的辦法錯過或犧牲掉，那眞是可惜之至了！</p>
<p>抗戰，就是建國的辦法，誰還能說建國沒有辦法呢？抗戰中的種種進行，種種事物，的確千頭萬緒，困難得很，然而自從我們全國一致打起精神來幹之後，已解决的困難已不知多少，未解决的困難，當然也在解决之中，誰還能說某一事沒有辦法呢？沒有辦法，只是自暴自棄，自甘墮落者的藉口！</p>
<p>最近，有關經濟命脈的土貨出口，就有了兩種極好的辦法：一，上海赴內地採購者，內地輸出者，統由商會證明，專作自用，不以資敵；二，土貨集中香港輸出，事前並由政府收買，加以統制。有關軍事本身的兵役法，也有了更為完備的修正。其他按照最好辦法，次第進行的庶政，正不知有多少，也就足以證實我的見解，而寬慰一般作杞憂的人了。</p>
<p>我希望對於任何事情，不再會聽見「沒有辦法」這樣的託詞，喪氣語。「知難行易」，是確切的原則，我們只要行，一行就會知。因此我們只要幹，一幹就有辦法。</p>
<h3 id="c139">一個女戰士 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 丁辛</p>
<p>黃昏，我們到了××山鎭，那原是一個很小的鄉鎭，在敵人的鐵蹄一再蹂躪以後，更變得蕭條而冷落了。刺人的寒風很有勁兒的，刮起了塵土；公路土望過去黃澄澄地沒有一個人影子，它靜靜地躺着，彷彿一條巨大的蟒蛇。</p>
<p>經過幾次的檢查與盤問，才找着所要到的地方，晚餐就在隊部裹和幾位武裝同志一起吃；飯菜雖是非常的粗劣，而我們在整天的勞動以後，都特別加餐。</p>
<p>隊長Y君是一個極有趣的靑年，還有幾位同志也都很熱情，他們高興的談話，允其講到作戰時的情况，更加有聲有色的呌人會忘掉疲乏。</p>
<p>在一個破敗的土地廟裹，我碰到了一位女同志，說起來伊還是我的同鄉，不過在以前大家不很相熟。我們熱烈地開始談起話來。伊呌孟瑛，老家在已經淪陷於魔手的靑浦北門外。伊曾在上海兩江女體師肄業，有很結實的身體，正和伊有緊强的個性一樣。伊的家毀滅以後，就跑到這兒來富一個女戰士，已經整整的半年了。</p>
<p>伊今年才只二十歲，非常活潑，說起話來很興奮，聲音像男子一樣的粗大。伊吿訴我說：</p>
<p>「在靑浦沒有淪陷之前，我就加入了當地的『婦女戰事服務團』工作着，因為我不曉得虛偽和容氣，一切粗重而別人不願意幹的工作，都由我擔當起來，因為這樣，我也曾得到了同志們的敬愛。</p>
<p>「然而，非常可惜的，當敵人的飛機在靑浦城廂不斷的轟炸以後，就把我們趕到鄉間。不久，我們又四散了，一直到現在，大家不通消息。」說到這裹，伊似乎很感槪的樣子。</p>
<p>當我拿出香烟呼着之後，伊又繼續說：</p>
<p>「我到了這裹，曾經和敵人作戰過四次，我們都獲了勝利。有些人說敵人的戰鬭力怎樣怎樣好，其實這些都是懼怕他們的說法，照我幾次的經騐來說，敵人都非常的怕死；他們所倚靠的，不過是犀利的器械罷了。講到作戰英勇，祗我們的戰士才有。」伊很興奮的揮着兩臂，喝了一口開水，又講着：</p>
<p>「有一决，我在沿靑滬公路一個呌××村的地方，碰見了三個鬼子，那眞是呌人興奮啊！他們見我是一個單身女子，就圍了上來，說着亂七八糟的中國話。他們以為我是一個亳無抵抗能力的中國弱女子。哼，也算他們瞎了眼晴，恰恰撞在我的手裹。」伊說着就對我笑了一笑，我急切地望着她底嘴唇。</p>
<p>「於是我就將計就計的對他們笑笑，」她接着說。「他們樂得幾乎發在。他們想進一步的來拉住我的臂膊，我乘勢立刻拔出傢伙，很爽快的送掉了他們的狗命，這眞是他們夢想不到的敎訓……，我沒有化掉第四顆子彈，眞太痛快了。這一回我還獲得了兩支很好的步槍，和一支手槍，那支手槍現在給Y隊長佩着。」</p>
<p>孟瑛很興奮地說着，還講到碰着我這一位同鄉，使伊很快活；因為在這裹祗有伊是本縣人，其他的同志全是異省的靑年。</p>
<p>我極驚異地瞧着這個勇敢的女戰士，伊忽然捋起了灰色布的衣袖來，在右臂膊的上部，露出了一個花生米那麼樣大小的傷疤。</p>
<p>於是伊又吿訴我說：在半年內，四次戰鬬中，伊一共擊斃了十一個鬼子，僅有一次受了輕傷。</p>
<p>那是多末光榮的烙痕啊。</p>
<p>在第三天白霧茫茫的早晨，我們離開了××山。途中，我默祝着這位女戰士的健康，和前途的光明。</p>

<p>我已悔悟了以前的人生，</p>
<p>奮力跳出了誘惑的陷穽，</p>
<p>從此抬頭向光明大道走，</p>
<p>創造出我未來的新生命，</p>
<p>我將頹廢了的精神重振，</p>
<p>同時把銷沉了的意志立定，</p>
<p>更懷着最大的决心，</p>
<p>準備改善我惡劣的環境。</p>
<p>一年多啦！</p>
<p>這全民族的抗戰，</p>
<p>我沒有負起靑年的使命，</p>
<p>也未曾盡過國民的責任！</p>

<p>使我不能再繼積的墮落，</p>
<p>更不應無意識的沉淪，</p>

<p>創造你的將來！</p>
<p>你要成為一個時代英雄！</p>

<p>— 莫邪</p>
<p>賣國賊古已有之，不自我始，不足為奇。烏龜忘八都是人做的，我亦猶人耳，姑妄為之，不足為寄。笑駡由他笑駡，好官我自為之，不足為奇。……</p>
<p>天下有多少罪惡，都在這不足為奇的自解中，輕輕地造成了。不足為奇，專門文過飾非，簡直是惡劣而不祥的名詞。</p>
<p>然而不足為奇，又未可以一概而論，用之得其當，却往往又能壯人的膽，長人的志氣，而於某種事件上著其成效。</p>
<p>見怪不怪，其怪自敗，正是不足為奇的最好註釋。例如敵人有猛烈的槍砲，不足為奇，我們有血肉造成的新的長城；敵人或者花言巧語，或者强詞奪理，搖惑人心，不足為奇，我們自有我們的主張；敵人大誇海口，虛聲恫嚇，不足為奇，我們的意志很堅定，泰山崩於前而色不變。……</p>
<p>不過在這一個不足為奇之下，可見我們必須要有所恃，有所以自處之道，那才好，否則這不足為奇，又將成為另一種解釋，有如下列的舉例：</p>
<p>陳後主聽見隋師渡江的消息，還是和宮女們唱着玉樹後庭花，不足為奇變成了有毒的定心丸。元兵已迫建康，買似道認為割地納幣足以了之，還是門蟋蟀要緊，不足為奇誤了國，誤了他自已。李自成破居庸關而直入，明廷一般大臣，還是酣歌恒舞，醉生夢死，不足為奇一變而為死有餘辜。……</p>
<p>這樣的不足為奇，是什麼解釋呢？無非是有意不買賬，存心撒爛汚。</p>
<p>於此，我們總已經知道應否不足為奇，並且在何種狀况之下才可以不足為奇吧。</p>
<p>不過以上所說的，都是國家大事，似乎範圍太大些，在個人方面說來，這不足為奇，又將怎樣適用呢？那就用我自己來作個例子：</p>
<p>有人對我說，某人變了，變壞了，我說，不足為奇，世界本來容易使人變壞。有人升官發財了，我說，不足為奇，機會本來大家都有的。有人無端刻薄我陰損我，我一笑置之，覺得不足為奇，因為人心險惡，早在我的意中。有人要我去看新出現的西洋景，東洋景，我不去，因為我知道，反正是那麼一會事，不足為奇。不論我受到什麼煩惱，苦楚，困阨，顛沛，舉凡一切不堪的事情，我都將不足為奇來一筆勾消之。我承認不足為奇對我有極大的妙用，我時常在應用着牠。</p>
<p>甚至我遇到眞正可以自殺的境地，我也活下去，原因便是死這件事，在我看來也是不足為奇；人人都會自殺，都會死，我又何必落人窠臼，步人後塵呢。</p>
<p>這也許還是我的消極的不足為奇，有些不足為訓吧？然而我覺得任何湯裹火裹的事情，在我看來，還都是不足為奇，我都可以幹得，假使環境和機會都允許我的話。我自巳也分不出我的不足為奇究竟是消極，是積極的。</p>
<p>我不知道現在的人有無不足為奇的觀念，更不知道他們的不足為奇，假使有，是什麼種類，到了什麼程度。我這樣說，大家或者也要說我不足為奇吧。</p>

<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>六　世外桃源</p>
<p>隨着戰局的演變，江南一帶的城鎭，淪陷的愈來愈多了，可是合浦鎭却反而成了逃難者所一致公認的世外桃源。因為這里交通不便，又非軍略要衝，所以蘇嘉湖一帶的居民，便都到這里來避亂，使這素來不為人掛齒的中等市鎭，擠得幾乎容納不下。</p>
<p>一切因戰事的接近而發生的憂慮恐怖，自從葉團長率部駐紮以來，已經一掃而空，這時更彷彿雲破月來，愈見開朗。由於逃難者的紛至沓來，人口增加，便造成鎭上市面空前未有的繁榮，不但許多店鋪都獲得了意外的贏利，就是三橡兩舍的人家，也因鎭上房屋不多，不敷逃難者的需求，都租得了善價。農民們不再為收割下來的稻無法出脫而擔心了，因為糧食的需要增多，來源却受了阻塞，祇患其少，不患其多，米價較戰前騰貴到一倍以上，還有繼續上漲的趨勢。</p>
<p>除了一些外來的日用品，像油監蠟燭火柴肥皂等類的東西，因為交通受阻，感覺缺乏以外，住在道里的人，一些都不感覺有什麼不便，更沒有誰想到離此不遠的地方，正在烽火連天，遭受着空前的浩刦。×兵既一次都未光顧，盜匪也因憚於葉團長的兵力不敢竊發，所以這里實在不愧稱為世外桃源，大家甚至一致給牠起了個別號，呌做「小上海」。</p>
<p>這「小上海」的繁榮，無疑地是完全建立在葉團長的部隊上面。葉團長一方面努力維持治安，一方面更不忘記革新地方上的庶政。他第一步工作是重新調查全鎭戶口，使奸究無從匿跡，其次是趁冬季農閒時候，積極舉辦壯丁訓練，不論巳未受訓的適齡壯丁，都要重新入營受訓。此外，他更鼓勵民衆在家裏建築避彈窖，又呌手下的士兵，在鎭上造了一座瞭望台，每日輪流派人在台頂監視，倘若發見了敵機的踪跡，馬上鳴鐘報警。這座瞭望台建築所需的木材，完全是由和豐木行主人蔡和豐捐助的。</p>
<p>葉團長這一切設施，凡是有遠見的人，無不同聲贊佩，可是也有一部份自私淺見的人，非但不肯奉行他的功令，還說他是無事忙，其中圖董楊岳梁便是詆譏他最烈的一個。</p>
<p>楊岳梁憑藉着他過去的優越地位，在鎭上做高利貸，放印子錢，盡量盤剝農民。他有一種古怪脾氣，便是不相信鈔票，只相信洋錢，常常對人家說：「洋錢總是銀子做的，鈔票只是一張紙頭，算得什麼！」所以他只拚命搜集現洋，設法鎔成銀塊，藏在家裹。大家都知道他家裹有錢，可是他在外表上却裝得很窮。</p>
<p>他起初對葉團長很巴結，原因很簡單，只是為了勢利，後來葉團長率部來了，他不但沒有得着什麼好處，反而喪失了不少私人利益。軍隊的給養旣要他負擔一部份，又因他家房屋高大，被借了一半去駐兵，使他不能騰出空屋來，租給外來的逃難者，所以他的不滿一天比一天深起來，不時對人說，鎭上的駐兵是多此一舉，並且從恿大家去要求葉團長，把部隊撤退，到別的地方去。（一九）</p>

<h3 id="c143">蔣委員長的兩篇講詞 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 玉全</p>
<p>這幾日報紙上曾發表了蔣委員長的兩篇講詞，一篇是十八日新生活運動五週紀念的廣播講演，一篇是本月十二日國民參政會在渝舉行第三屆會議時的演說，這兩篇講詞，於我們國民是有切身關係的，可是這幾日大家都忙着找尋廢歷新年裹的「快樂」，注意國事的人並不多，據一個報販吿訴我，他在新年的這兩三天中所責掉的報紙，不及平時的一半，於此可見，孤島上大部份的國民，只知找尋「快樂」，已把國家事丟於一旁了！</p>
<p>蔣委員長指示我們：「尊嚴整飭的紀律，慷慷慨槪的犧牲，實實在在的節約，轟轟烈烈的奮鬥」，現在我們且來切實的反省一下，有沒有奮鬥？有沒有守紀律？有沒有犧牲？有沒有節約？多數的國民，在這已廢除的奮歷新年裏，還不肯放鬆的去找尋「快樂」，試問對得住國家否？希望孤島上的國民，讀過蔣委員長的演說詞之後，自己來警惕一下，新生活是以「明禮義，知廉恥，守紀律，負責任」為綱領，新生活的規律，是全中國人民的生活規律，從此我們大家要把自己的生活改善一下，促進國民的戰時生活，達到生活的「軍事化」，「生產化」，「合理化」，以應付這非常時期的偉大局面！</p>
<p>「第二期抗戰的任務，就要集中發揮我們前後方，乃至被佔區內的一切力量，爭取最後勝利與建國的成功」。「我們除了繼續注重軍事與物質以外，更要特別注重精神抵抗力！」「我以為强　化的精神，集中精神，以我們的言論行動，領導全國精神動員，應該是本屆大會的工作中心所在。」此上是蔣委員長在參政會中所說，這一次蔣委員長主張以言論行動，領導全國精神總動員，居住孤島上的國民，要切實的注意—我們現在被困在這四面楚歌的環境裏，我們要拿出一切的力量，拿出我們的精神來抵抗强暴，以爭取最後的勝利與建國的成功！</p>
<p>「我們每個人都以國家民族的利益，放在第一位，更要推己及人，相信中華民國的國民，都有愛國的良知，有了共信，就必有互信。我們要怎樣做到眞誠純一呢？能為國家民族而犧牲，才是眞誠，國家民族而外，無其他雜念，纔是純一，我們為了國家，死且不惜，遑論其他。我們全體一致站在國家民族第一上，宣傳耍為國家民族而宣傳，行動要為國家民族而行動，乃至思想，也要為國家民族而思想，我們在己固要竭誠努力，然是要純粹為國努力，然後纔能發生共同力量，來對付共同敵人，完成我們共同志願！」</p>
<p>孤島上的國民，雖有大多數的人在努力救國的工作，但一般胡天胡地，自私自利的人，仍有不少把國難置之度外，這些人如果眞正不忘國家，應立即振作起來，拿出精神來抵抗敵人，以盡國民天職</p>
<h3 id="c144">月薪·花紅·負債 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 李良</p>
<p>—上海薪給階級的經濟狀况</p>
<p>在上海，薪給每月一百元的公務員，其日常的生活，自然比了每月僅只支着三四十元薪水的舊式商店職員是好得多，可是論其實際，舊式商店職員的月入雖微，可是到了年終，倒有不少人能吃剩有餘。而公務員們，反得舉債，而謀年關的挨度。其原因是很簡單的，因為公務員，一個月掙來一個月用，到了年底，尊賬像雪片般飛來，便無法應付；奮式商店職員，雖然也是一個月掙來一個月用，然而到了年底，分花紅，加升工，其數也殊可觀。將此額外收入，還賬過年，綽有餘裕。雖然平日或許日常開支稍感不敷，而東移西借，然而以年終的額外所得，截長補短，最低限度，總也能宿逋全淸。而同時，公務員呢，若是一經舉債，因月薪之外，別無額外收入，可資挹注，便不免於日積月累，而無由自拔。</p>
<p>雖然同是維持一個若干口之家，若是每月有一百元，或是以上的收入的，便得於一百元或是以上的塲面。若是每月僅只三四十元，或其以下的收入，其塲面也跟着比例的縮小，這是在上海住家的生活與享受的通例，所以俗語有「多賺多用，少賺少用」那麼一句話。換一句話說，便是不論掙得多，掙得少，要從月薪之中，積存起錢來眞不是一回子容易之事。因為掙一百，而把生活壓緊到五十元的開支，那是上海人所死也不肯的。因此，每月掙三四十元的，固然是到了月底，囊棄無餘，每月掙一百二百的，到了月底，也無不像熱鍋上螞蟻，那麼的盼望支薪的日子到臨。</p>
<p>上面所說的，還不過就是月薪與生活而論，舊式商店的職員，在目前，自然是長衫階級之中，最掙不起錢的一種人物，然而我人若是放過了日常生活的優劣不說，而以一般的經濟情形而論，或許負債最低的，倒還是舊式商店的職員。據在一家經營信用小借款的放款銀行服務的一位朋友的統計，在最近四年中，債戶之中，在舊式商店中服務的，僅百分之十稍弱；在洋行銀行，以及公司等等服務的，佔百分之四十稍弱；在機關中服務的所謂公務員，佔百分之四十稍强；共他約在百分之十左右。從這上面，我人已可明暸着上海人的經濟狀况。（明日續完）</p>
<h3 id="c145">窗口生涯 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>在近來這種年頭兒中，除了你有高貴的親戚，或有有力者的推薦與提拔，你想找一個可以勉强維持一天起碼的生活的位置，可眞不容易。自從戰事發生之後，這種職業恐慌的問題，就更形普遍而嚴重了。本來有職位，生活過得很舒適的人，職位現在被無情的砲火轟去了；本沒有職業的人，到今日就更加變得可憐，為的是競爭的人增多了的綠故。在每一個街頭巷尾間，現在不都是充滿了裁員，减薪，留職停薪的聲音嗎？由此看來，一般日前正有着位置的人，不論其怎樣的低小卑微，吾們都可以說是挺幸運的人兒，而他們的必須小心地作事，保住飯碗不要敲破，當然也是有理由的。</p>
<p>以吾自己個人來說，吾在某個機關的「窗口」上做事，在處理每一樣事情的時候，總是小心翼翼地，不肯讓它有錯；有時候，並且儘可能耐下了各種煩惱，裝出笑臉，以款待「窗口」外的人們。—永不要得罪人，這是我抱定的作事的中心。</p>
<p>說到「窗口」，它是各個銀行，各個機關與外界接觸的媒介。與一般商店里的「掌櫃」同樣，在「窗口」上做事的，也要有非常的經騐與其他的條件。好，從謀職的困難說到我在「窗口」上作事的方針，現在郤又說到關於「窗口生涯」上來了。在後面，就讓吾來對它報導一番吧。</p>
<p>在「窗口」上做事的，凖先要有豐富的經騐，才可勝任；雖然，各機關與銀行里都有「問訊處」設着，但普通的一般人，郤好像都並不高興上那里去，於是在這種情形之下，坐在窗口邊的人，就要預備來應付這些人對你提出的各項問題了。他們會提出各部份的，離奇可怪的問題來問你，有時候，明明你是坐在收電匯的窗口下，可是他們郤會挪一大堆與電滙無關的東西來問，或者，更會滔滔不絕地與你交談起來，這時候，你的手中正忙得不堪，想不理睬他們吧，恐怕他們要咆哮起來，耍是與他們接談吧，你手中的事情郤又要不及幹了；這一種兩難的情緒，在他們的心中，可不會知道的</p>
<p>除了經騐之外，過「窗口生涯」的人，又要有非常的耐心才可。上面所說到的這許多對你無關緊要的問題，有時候，眞會引起你內心的煩惱來。假使再加上問你的人，有一個粗暴，魯莽的性子，而你又沒有很好的耐心的話，則你的將會問得冒起火來，或者甚至於還要打起架來，是準會見到的事實。所以，在「窗口」上做事的人呀，你們的心中，雖然有萬分的說不出的苦困，討厭，煩惱，你門的臉部的表情，郤還是要裝出滿意的，稱心的笑容來。否則，你們都是板着面孔，臉部所顯出的，總是一副頹喪的神情，那末，準會有人說你有一種惡劣的脾氣，或者當面駡你「赤老」，或者更會報吿你的上司，使你的飯碗，在不知不覺之中敲破哩。</p>
<p>此外，每一個當「櫃員」的，還需要一種迅速的手脚，與一種伶俐的口齒。一方面，你要用嘴巴回答這個人的問題，在另一方面，你的兩手，郤又要很快地替那個人辦理各事。坐在「窗口」邊的人，頭腦必須淸楚，又必定要眼快，口快，心快，手快；否則你如果慢吞吞地幹你的事，那般性急的，不肯稍為等一下的「窗外人」，就會噪了起來，高聲地呼呌起各種不堪人耳的駡語來，嚇得你手忙脚亂，使你的事情統統辦錯的。</p>
<p>在上海，這種過着機械的，被動的，不自由的「窗口生涯」的人，正不知有多少；他們原來所有的一切脾氣，性子，都被外界所征服了，即使尙有些餘剩的火氣的人，則想到了目前謀職的困難與失業後的苦處，恐怕總也要稍稍將性子按捺住一下吧，而無怪乎要有人說「吃了三年窗口飯，此人火氣便全無」了。窗口生涯的苦處，從這里就不難見到。</p>

<p>還有一件國際新聞，却是很神妙的，乃是各國用一種科學方法，將沙漠變成沃壤。這最初是蘇聯的幾位地質學家，氣象學家發起的，後來各國的科學家，也來響應了。發表了許多理論，這種滄海變桑田的寓言，居然要用人工實地做起來。起初不過發為文章，在雜誌上登載登載，但是那班科學家，不肯說說就算了，他們坐而言者，就要起而行。他們以為說得到，就要做得到，世界上極鉅大的工程，都是用極愚笨的方法做起。便是初發明鐵路的時候，不過用兩根鐵條，要直舖到幾千里幾萬里之遙，這多們笨的設計。但是到了現在，鐵道四通八達，誰還敢說它笨嗎？就是飛機，起初也不過從小孩子所放的風箏上，拔出苗頭來罷了。如今他們預備從幾處小沙漢的地方，先行試騐起來。組織了似公司性質的一個集團，開河，種樹，以及各種各樣的事，都在進行了。這與中國很有關係，因為中國境內，也有幾處沙漠呢。這幾條新聞報吿已畢，火車也漸近穌州。趙樂天知道她們都是到蘇州的，因知道何家兩家兩位小姐是廣東籍，便問：『是不是到蘇州去游玩？現在蘇州足以游玩之處很多呢』，吳君素代答道：「不！她們還耍到自由村去咧。」趙樂天聽了欣然道：『到自由村去嗎？那裹這位朱村長朱老源先生，還是我的老朋友咧。倘然見了朱村長，代我候候他。只說在火車上，遇到了一條腿的趙樂天趙瘋子，他就知道了』。說時，哈哈的笑了一陣。吳君素道：「原來趙先生與朱村長是老友。此刻這兩位姊姊去造訪的，便是朱村長的孫小姐，朱愛人女醫師。因為我們那兩位姊姊，在美國時，和朱愛人是同學，非常要好的。回國以後，各歸原籍，這回子，因為伺家兩位姊姊，隨着她們的尊翁到上海來，所以特地的要去拜訪朱愛人了」。趙樂天道：「好極了！說起來就彼此都認得。朱村長是我的老朋友，他缺了一隻膀子，我短了一條腿兒。我常常給他說笑話，我說：「我們兩人凑起來，是三隻膀子三條腿」。三條腿倒沒有什麼，這三隻手却不好聽呢」？（四四）</p>

<p>愚友范拜竹君，戰前係武進派報社主人，在武進社會中，以提倡社會公益及戲劇有聲於時。若干年前，蓋呌天會在常州與人合辦某劇院，並携其張家班如小蓋呌天，張翼鵬·張質斌·張國斌單及祁彩芬，張月亭·趙玉蘭·諸角蒞常公演，時値褥署，院小悶熱，營業不甚得意，與蓋呌天合作之人，遂予蓋呌天以種種煩悶。及結束，某方不允將蓋呌天應得之款交出，致蓋呌天一行，在常一籌莫展，范拜竹聞悉之餘，出而仗義執言，對某方頗多實言，謂不應以地方勢力欺侮外客，得范一言，蓋呌天始得從容回滬，范在戰後寓滬作客，絕未訪晤蓋呌天一次也。</p>
<p>大除夕之夜，范君因受某報之託，特赴蓋呌天寓中，為某報謀一皇后劇院廣吿事，投片求見，蓋呌天倒展迎客，並語屋中諸人，悉行退去；繼復請范登樓，對范執禮甚恭，並面致昔年在常承范君鼎力相助之感。蓋呌天當時或誤以范君為移款而來，特先面吿范君，謂先生久寓滬上，如有所需，請以實吿，老五（蓋呌天自稱）在滬，非侷促在武進之情形可比，其言槪爽而意又出於至誠。范君笑謂蓋呌天曰：君眞古之君子也，熱腸古道，至深敬佩！此來實代友人兜一筆廣吿生意耳。蓋呌天慨然日諾，遂相與談別後事者，約一小時而別。又蓋呌天謂皇后之約，純係顧全友人情面，始允登台，蓋呌天並詳述其諸子之學藝經過及在滬近狀至為詳盡云。</p>

<p>推行一日救難運動</p>
<p>上海的游藝界，這為應難民救濟協會之請，在此廢曆新年之中，自二月二十一日起至二十三日止，實行總動員，作三天大規模的廣播，為上海難民呼籲，冀市民能實行一日救難運動，的確是空前的盛會。</p>
<p>在廢曆新年之中，游藝界方面，東奔西走，每天忙着為各游藝塲服務，當然加倍辛苦。但他們能够從百忙中抽出一部分時間，為了難胞而服務，這種精神，是値得我們欽佩。而且我們把廣播的節目閱讀一下，覺得這次的廣播，如京劇，滑稽，申曲，彈詞，評話，四明文戲，四明宣卷，蘇灘，故事，歌唱，文戲，小曲，杭灘等，莫不應有盡有，而各方面的游藝名家，都親自登台播唱，熱誠是可見一斑的了。</p>
<p>任何人都不會否認，由游藝界從業員用廣播的方法，向各界聽衆募捐，成效最大。過往，無論默金運動，救難運動，祇要有游藝界從業員在電台上開了口，就可募得大批捐款，何况這次大規模的廣播，又洽在廢歷新年之中。新年，大家知道，不浪費的也要浪費，是一個最浪費的季節。而値此市民盡情浪費金錢的時候，游藝界作大規模廣播，吿訴一般娛樂的人，上海還有不少難胞，在飢寒交迫之下，希望大家至少節省一日的浪費來救難，不管是向一般人灌了一服消醒劑，所得到的成效，當然比平常的廣播還要大。</p>
<p>的確，娛樂不忘救難，是上海市民應負的責任。省下一些娛樂的費用來救難，是最容易的事，任何人都能做到的。因此，筆者深望一般的市民，聽到這一次的廣播之後，大家能够實行一日救難運動！</p>

<p>— 慤</p>
<p>徐慕雲著　世界書局發行</p>
<p>中國的戲劇，完全是一種抽象的藝術，無論是唱，做，念，打以及一舉手一投足，沒有一處不是在藝術的立塲上表現出來的。猶其是具有長久的歷史，才能够漸趨改革，成為東方藝術界的一種偉績。（現在因為改進派的發現，及伶人自己的不肯深切研究，眞正的戲劇藝術已較全盛時代退步不少；伶人們要是再不覺悟，恐怕要站不住了。）我們中國，有了這們好的藝衛，而自己人祇知道用他來消遺，用他來娛樂心神，確始終很少有人去研究它。倒是歐美人士反能認識中國戲的藝術，而加以贊譽，並從事研究，這是多麼奇怪的現象啊。徐慕雲先生，對於戲的研究，已不是短時期了。因為他老先生對於中國戲已有心得，對於中國戲感有興趣；平時對於戲圈裏頭的人接觸的特別多，所以關於戲的一切的一切，也明瞭的最澈透。徐先生在二十年前，就曾想拿他自己研究的所得，作一篇「中國戲的史」或是一種別樣有系統的記載，一半固然是因為時間上未能許可，另一方面也因為助手缺乏，沒有能够完成他這個宏願。後來看見日本人迂聽花及英國人阿靈頓全都有過這類的作品，雖然覺得他們對於中國戲還沒有研究透澈，作出來的東西，不免謬誤百出不能使人滿意，然而又覺得，中國的戲劇，旣然在藝術上，佔有這們大的價値，別國人，尙肯加以研究，著有作品，何以中國人自已就不肯研究？不肯將我們這種偉大的藝術來發揚呢？他有了這個感覺之後，所以對於「中國戯劇史」的著作，下了一個最大的决心；但是事與願違，他老先生雖將各種材料，早已慢慢的搜羅齊全，可是一時竟仍沒有達到這個目的。最近又經他的努力，並得到了褚民誼先生等的贊助，全書果然出版問世了。徐先生的生花妙筆，是人盡知之的，他對於戲學研究的精深，也是人無不曉的；凡是看過在本刋所發表的「故都宮闈梨園秘史」的，更可以看出來他除了戲的正史以外，而於梨園行一切細小的掌故，也全能知道詳盡，眞是淵博得很。以他老先生對於中國戲劇，如此的研究；又經過了多年心血的採集；這本「中國戲劇史」的內容的美滿豐富，可想而知了。全書共分五卷，一二兩卷是詳述古今各地的戲劇優伶歷史，要是沒有充分的材料和考據，是不能落筆的，卷三是分析角色的類別以及前後台塲面服裝的組織名稱，不單是詳盡有徵，而且說得旣靈活，佈局父淸楚，使看的人一目了然。其中尤以卷四臉譜與服裝的研究，更屬可貴，文字是那麼委婉，再加上極有價値的彩色臉譜五十三種，不可多得的彩色劇照五十幀，將舞台上各種人物句括罄盡，其名貴可愛自不待言。第五卷是偏於戲劇研究上的，這對於研究戲學的人尤多借鏡之處。現在本書問世，我敢說戲劇界必有所推動，而且國外視聽方面，也必可以增加很多良好的印象。徐先生現在並有一個志願，打算要求當局的贊助，將庚子賠款，撥下一部份，帮助他譯成英法文本，到國外去宣傳，假如這件事情能够成功，那麼中國的戲劇學，必可在歐美兩洲，放一異彩，而歐美人士，對於中國戲劇的眞相如何更有進一步的認識了。本書出版伊始，我巳經披閱一過，至於內容究竟如何好法，看過自然知道了。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The situation in South China is increasingly tense. Japanese warships from Weizhou Island are gathering in the Haikou and Xuwen waters. Xuwen is now in a state of war. The Japanese army is plotting a landing on the Leizhou Peninsula, and Chinese defense forces across the country are maintaining strict vigilance. A key Guizhou military official has arrived at a location in southern Guangdong to provide guidance on the war of resistance. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to reports from Guangzhou Bay, Beihai and nearby towns have been heavily bombed by Japanese aircraft. On the morning of the 21st, Japanese troops landed west of Beihai but were repulsed, leaving behind more than 20 bodies. Guerrilla warfare has broken out in the southern section of the Yuehan Railway and between Zengcheng and Conghua on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, with daily contact with Japanese troops. The main Japanese forces are still concentrated around Guangzhou, Zengcheng, and Conghua. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources from Guilin, 11 Japanese warships suddenly shelled Guantouling near Beihai on the morning of the 21st of this month, attempting to provide cover for a Japanese troop landing. Chinese defenders immediately returned fire with heavy artillery and machine guns, repelling the Japanese troops attempting to land. After an hour and a half of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the assault and retreated. On the morning of the 26th, several Japanese motorboats continued to patrol near Guantouling, making the situation there very tense. (23rd Quick News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, fierce fighting is currently taking place east of the southern section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, from Longgang Market to Henggang. Chinese troops in the Beijiang area launched an attack from Yinzhan'ao yesterday, engaging Japanese troops near Shiling for three hours before retreating to their original positions. There have been no changes on the Xijiang front. Approximately 5,000 Japanese troops are currently stationed in the Sanshui and Southwest areas. (23rd Quick News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Although reinforced, the Japanese troops on Hainan Island are aggressively invading the interior, but they have been blocked by Chinese troops in the coastal counties and have not been able to advance. The fighting near Anding is still intense. Local residents on the island are assisting the isolated troops in resisting the Japanese. In the past ten days, one-fourth of the Japanese troops who landed have been annihilated by Chinese forces. According to a telegram from Wang Yi, the commander of the Qiongya Garrison, Chinese troops killed 1,000 Japanese soldiers in Jiaji and Chenshui in eastern Qiong, and shot down three Japanese aircraft in Anding. The Japanese attempts to establish a puppet "Hainan Maintenance Association" have failed. They are now attempting to occupy the entire island and deal with possible international disputes, so they have temporarily suspended military operations to invade the East, West, and North Rivers and the central area. The Chinese army is taking advantage of the opportunity to launch a counter-offensive. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a report from the Guangdong Provincial Government to Chongqing yesterday, from January 1st to February 10th, the Japanese side transported back to Japan the cremated remains of 3,200 Japanese soldiers from South China. These Japanese soldiers were either killed in battle or died from illness. Last week, a Japanese brigade was transported from Guangzhou to Hainan Island to reinforce the Japanese troops on the island. (22nd Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a recent public statement by the Chinese Intelligence Committee, there are currently one million Chinese troops fighting the Japanese army on the front lines from Hainan Island in the south to Baotou in Inner Mongolia in the north. These troops represent one-third of China's regular army. These million troops are the so-called mobile units or guerrilla forces. The Chongqing Military Affairs Commission has completed the difficult task of unifying the command of these million guerrilla troops. The "Guerrilla Squad" within the National Military Council uses wireless telegraphy to command guerrilla military operations, serving as the highest command authority for guerrilla warfare. Chongqing is the center of the national wireless command network. From now on, guerrilla forces in various regions have become a unified military organization. The strategy of Chinese guerrilla forces is to achieve the greatest benefits with the least losses. Guerrilla forces constantly harass the Japanese army's rear and flanks, helping the Chinese army defend designated fronts or strongholds. They force the Japanese army to increase troop deployments along transportation lines, reducing the strength of the Japanese defense forces, keeping the Japanese army busy dealing with the gradual weakening of Japanese forces, and ultimately driving out the Japanese army. Guerrilla forces also pay attention to disrupting the Japanese conspiracy to establish schools in various regions. To maintain the morale of the people, guerrilla forces often launch attacks when the Japanese plan to construct cultural projects in suburban areas. The Military Affairs Commission's "Guerrilla Squad" is currently busy organizing special committees to oversee the political work of the guerrilla forces. From now on, the Japanese army will face even greater difficulties. (23rd Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) After several months of investigation, the Chinese military police authorities have finally uncovered a major spy organization in Hunan. It is reported that several Chinese traitors leaked important military intelligence, such as the locations of Chinese Air Force mechanized units and armories, to Japanese intelligence personnel. As a result of this investigation, several leaders of the spy organization have been arrested, including Xu Shaofu and Cai Jian (both transliterations). It is reported that they had organized a "Pro-Japan Association" and an "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army." According to the Chinese authorities' investigation, the trail eventually led to the south-central part of Hunan Province. Based on the obtained leads, Xu Shaofu's various activities were discovered. An accomplice, Cai Jian, is said to be a graduate of the Baoding Military Academy and had served as a brigade commander. Before the September 18th Incident, they had already organized a "Pro-Japan Association" to sell Japanese goods in Hunan Province. After the outbreak of the current war, their organization transformed into a major spy organization. During the investigation of this case, the authorities intercepted a letter from Xu Shaofu, using the alias "Xu Yu," to Japanese intelligence personnel. The letter detailed the history of their organization, provided the locations of Chinese airfields, and listed the names of unemployed military officers in Hunan Province who could be bribed. It is reported that Xu also revealed the locations of Chinese anti-aircraft guns and other important military information. Xu, after explaining the importance of Hunan Province in the current war, urged Japanese intelligence personnel to give favorable consideration to their proposals. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Editorial: Educating Refugees <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>"Relief for refugees should emphasize both assistance and education." This is a very common saying, and it can also be said to be the ultimate principle of relief work.</p>
<p>Although the relief work of the past year and seven months cannot be said to have been done perfectly, it can be considered satisfactory. In particular, refugee education has been very effective. Consider the statistics released by the Education Committee of the Shanghai Red Cross Society:</p>
<p>"At the peak of the refugee crisis in Shanghai, there were 149,700 refugees. Among them, 32,948 were school-age children, of which 27,948 have received refugee education. 22,787 adults have been educated. There are a total of 580 teachers, including 302 volunteer teachers. The monthly expenses are approximately 2,000 yuan."</p>
<p>From this statistical table, we know that more than 70% of refugee children and 50% of adult refugees have received refugee education. Such a large percentage of educated individuals is not easy to achieve even in normal education in China. This is commendable in one aspect. The maximum salary for refugee teachers is only eight yuan per month, and they share food and lodging with the refugees. The number of volunteer teachers even exceeds half. These teachers are mostly young students who do not take any compensation but serve the refugees. This is commendable in a second aspect. The cost of refugee education is less than four cents per person per month. These four cents include paper, pens, books, and teacher salaries. Such economical education is best suited for refugee education, and this point is also worth noting.</p>
<p>Are there still refugees in Shanghai? Yes! Yes! Yes! There are at least another 100,000 people, some living in shelters and others sleeping on the streets. Should we continue to provide these refugees with appropriate education? Of course, we should! Therefore, we not only hope that those in charge of refugee education will continue the education that has already been provided, but also pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>First, pay attention to productive education. Relief for refugees should not only encourage the wealthy to support the refugees, but also find ways to enable the refugees to support themselves. The most important thing for a person to be able to support themselves is to have a skill. Therefore, promoting technical education for refugees has already attracted attention. However, there are various different skills. We hope that the skills that refugees learn are productive skills, which can increase national wealth. This will not only allow refugees to support themselves but also bring great benefits to the country and society.</p>
<p>Second, pay attention to spiritual training. Displaced refugees not only suffer physical pain and material losses, but also suffer primarily spiritual pain. Spiritual pain must be relieved correctly, otherwise, the future is unimaginable. How to implement spiritual education for refugees in Shanghai? Here are eight words that can be contributed: "Love the country and the hometown, unite sincerely." On the negative side, make the refugees understand the real reasons for their current plight, and never harbor resentment towards the central government; on the positive side, unite sincerely to seek independence, equality, and freedom for the country and the nation. If refugees can receive such education, then once they return home, they will also be very useful citizens.</p>
<p>Third, pay attention to mobilizing specialists, university students, middle school students, and passionate youths to jointly educate refugees. In the past, ordinary people contributed money to help refugees, and indeed fulfilled a considerable responsibility. Young people contributed their efforts to educate refugees and also fulfilled a considerable effort. However, there are still 100,000 refugees, and not only is material relief still needed, but education needs to be intensified. Who will shoulder this responsibility? Shanghai gathers many specialists, university students, middle school students, and ordinary passionate youths. These many people are the most important roles in refugee education. Therefore, it is hoped that the thousands upon thousands of specialists, university students, middle school students, and passionate youths in Shanghai will automatically rise up to educate refugees. As for the personnel who are currently educating refugees, they should also mobilize their relatives and friends to engage in refugee education.</p>
<p>Fourth, pay attention to guiding refugees to educate themselves. We know that refugees live in shelters temporarily and will eventually disperse or return home. Therefore, refugee education is slightly different from ordinary school education or mass education. The most different point is to give refugees permanent education in the shortest period. This task seems difficult at first glance, as if education is omnipotent. In fact? As long as the educators guide the refugees to develop their ability to educate themselves, and be able to use the collective to educate themselves, then although the educators may not be able to teach much in a certain period, what the educated people gain will be inexhaustible for a lifetime. Therefore, in the future, in assessing the results of refugee education, in addition to directly assessing the materials taught, it is especially important to assess the refugees' ability to educate themselves.</p>
<p>Fifth, pay attention to discovering talented individuals among the refugees. It is well known that there are many technical talents in the refugee community. In recent times, more and more people have also paid attention to the fact that there are many geniuses in the refugee community, especially talented refugee children. Talented children or adults are all excellent elements born by the country and the nation. If we find ways to discover them and give them extremely effective talent education, this will cultivate a lot of national strength for the country and the nation. Therefore, the refugee community is like a mine, and those in charge of education must find various useful minerals in the mine. Although this work sounds idealistic, it is actually a fundamental work of nation-building.</p>
<p>Mobilizing the compassion of Shanghai's four million citizens will surely support the 100,000 refugees who remain in Shanghai; mobilizing the thousands upon thousands of educators and enthusiastic people in Shanghai will surely educate Shanghai's 100,000 refugees to become extremely useful talents for the country and the nation. This newspaper will follow all Shanghai residents in working together towards this wish.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Foreign Observers Claim Chinese Military Strength is Increasing; Standardized Equipment Throughout; Total Troop Strength Now Exceeds 200 Divisions; Experienced Officers Training New Recruits; Artillery, Air Force, and Mechanized Units Being Replenished Quickly; Government Does Not Discriminate Against the Communist Party <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Observers of Chinese affairs are currently focusing their attention on two issues: (1) The extent of the Chinese Communist Party's influence on the government; (2) The strength of the Chinese military. According to these observers, the widespread rumor that the Chinese Communist Party controls the government is absolutely absurd. Before the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, there were rumors that the government was about to be reorganized to allow Communist leaders to join, but this did not materialize. The only Communist leader in the government is Zhou Enlai, who serves as the Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission. The Minister of that department is General Chen Cheng, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's most trusted and capable general. It is reported that Mao Zedong, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, is still in Yan'an in northern Shaanxi. Zhu De, the commander-in-chief of the Communist army, is still commanding the Eighth Route Army in Jinji under the orders of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Other Communist leaders, such as Wang Ming and Qin Bangxian, do not hold government positions but are merely members of the National Political Council, which is an advisory body without executive power. After the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council, rumors spread that the council would include Communist leaders, but this expectation has proven to be false. This is because the council is under the direction of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and therefore cannot contain members who are not members of the Kuomintang. The Communist Party had proposed allowing its members to participate in the council, but this was rejected by the Kuomintang. Therefore, the above-mentioned point is indeed true. The rumors of the Chinese Communist Party's influence are often exaggerated. There are three reasons for this: (1) The Kuomintang side remains silent on this matter; (2) The Chinese Communist Party side widely publicizes it; (3) There is a tendency to overestimate the strength and fantasize about the activities of anything hidden. It is very obvious that the Kuomintang is not currently oppressing Communist Party members. The reason for this is quite simple: this move is neither necessary nor justified. The Chinese Communist Party has only limited political and military power, and its power is currently fully used to support the government and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in the war against Japan. The Communist Party members have no intention of taking any steps that would embarrass the Chinese government, so the government has no reason to adopt a hostile attitude towards them. The government's attitude towards the Communist Party is no different from its attitude towards other parties that support the war of resistance against Japan. Observers also stated that since the outbreak of the war, China's military strength has rapidly improved not only in quantity but also in quality. At the time of the Lugouqiao Incident, the equipment and officers of the army units, except for the divisions of the central government, were poor. However, after the development of the war, the government gradually standardized the equipment of all Chinese troops and began to train new recruits with experienced and capable officers from the central government army. The officers in the new army were all appointed from those who were experienced and well-trained. The defensive situation at the time of the loss of Guangzhou is an example of the situation of the army facing Japan, but this has since been remedied. When the Japanese army landed in Daya Bay, only 60,000 Chinese troops were stationed along the coast of Guangdong Province, from Hainan Island in the south to Shantou in the north. When the Guangdong army was transferred back to the Guangzhou area from the Yangtze River basin, each division had only 6,000 soldiers. When Yu Hanmou withdrew from Guangzhou, his entire Guangdong army had only 35,000 soldiers left. But today's situation is very different from the past. Not only have these divisions been replenished to full strength, but every county town in Guangdong Province outside the guerrilla areas now has a self-defense force, equipped with weapons provided by the government and commanded by capable officers appointed by the government. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has not only reorganized his infantry but has also brought China's air force, artillery, mechanized, and cavalry units to a high standard. The total strength of the Chinese army now exceeds 200 divisions. This has been announced by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin. As for the air force, artillery, and mechanized units, although no news has been revealed, Reuters has learned from reliable sources that the government is doing its utmost to quickly train and organize them. The mechanized units of the Chinese army have not yet shown their strength in the war. In the past few months, the public has not seen the Chinese Air Force, mechanized units, and artillery units perform significantly, but this does not indicate a lack of appropriate equipment. In fact, the Chinese Supreme Commander wants to preserve his equipment and soldiers for the later stages of the war, for a full-scale general offensive on the front lines. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Fifth Anniversary of the New Life Movement: Chairman Chiang's Broadcast Speech <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from the previous day) The needs created by reality and the arduous War of Resistance have already brought about considerable progress. Not only does Zhongzheng [Chiang Kai-shek] personally feel excited, but all patriotic compatriots must also feel that this is the inevitable path to national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>From now on, we must further align with the nation's current situation and unleash our nation's latent power, making the New Life Movement a weapon for winning the War of Resistance and a driving force for promoting national reconstruction. How should we make further efforts? We must understand the original intention when the New Life Movement was initiated, and we must also examine our nation's current environment. When I advocated the New Life Movement five years ago, the main goal was to restore our nation's sense of honor and shame, so that when the nation faced foreign aggression, everyone could be responsible, disciplined, and display our nation's ability to unite against the enemy, share the same boat, resist aggression, and strive for survival. In other words, this new life is military life, it is wartime life. Compatriots should also know that this wartime life is actually modern life, because in this day and age, whether individuals or society, cannot exist without practicing wartime life and will be eliminated.</p>
<p>Now, since July 7th, we have been subjected to large-scale aggression by the violent enemy for a year and a half. Our War of Resistance has entered its second phase and has reached a critical juncture for determining success or failure, survival or destruction. We must overcome this final hurdle, eliminate the brutal enemy, and achieve our final victory. Only then will we have a glorious existence and a peaceful life. Since our nation is in such a critical and extraordinary period, the New Life Movement also follows the progress of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction and enters a new and important stage. Therefore, our individual life rules and the entire national spirit must also have further expressions. Originally, the spirit of the New Life Movement was built on "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and sense of shame" and manifested in "clothing, food, housing, and transportation." Many of its meanings and expressions are already explained in great detail in the New Life Movement Outline and do not need further explanation. However, now, due to our War of Resistance situation, the general state of national life has undergone great changes, so the way we promote and express our spirit should naturally have a more concrete and active posture. Only when the spirit of this movement can precisely coordinate with the actual needs of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction can we accomplish the mission we should bear. I now want to explain to our compatriots the significance of the rules of national life during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the word "propriety." The original explanation is "an attitude of following rules and regulations." But now, it should advance from an attitude of following rules and regulations to strict and orderly discipline, because discipline is more important than everything else in the process of War of Resistance and national reconstruction. We should pay attention to the orderliness of personal life attitude in peacetime, and we need to practice the discipline of national security in wartime. Without this, we cannot create a unified force. For example, young men of age should serve in the military. This is a tangible discipline promulgated by national laws. Welcoming soldiers on their expedition and respecting and caring for wounded soldiers and serving them is an intangible discipline recognized by society. All citizens of the Republic of China must adhere to this attitude in order to comply with the rules and meet the needs of the country. Our Book of Rites says, "Do not seek to survive when facing disaster." This is the ultimate expression of propriety. In wartime, complying with all national laws and absolutely not considering personal interests is considered not violating "propriety."</p>
<p>Second, let's talk about the word "righteousness." The original explanation is "upright and proper behavior." But now, it should advance from upright and proper behavior to "generous sacrifice." Armed comrades bravely fight the enemy on the battlefield, and compatriots from all over enthusiastically enlist in the military. These are naturally generous sacrifices. In addition, donating wealth to serve the country, responding to work calls, and compatriots in the war zone destroying their own factories, burning their own grain reserves, and suffering losses rather than handing them over to the enemy are also extremely generous acts of sacrifice. This is a high expression of "righteousness."</p>
<p>Third, let's talk about the word "integrity." The original explanation is "clear distinction." Now, it should advance from clear distinction to "true and practical thrift." Because modern warfare is entirely a final competition of the sum of human and material resources, whoever's economy and materials can supply continuously is who wins the final victory. Therefore, not only should we absolutely cherish public funds and public property, and should not have the slightest waste or encroachment, but also we should equally cherish each individual's property, and even wild grass and trees that have no owner, and not allow arbitrary consumption, so that we can cultivate our national strength as much as possible. The original meaning of the two words "thrift" is to require each of us to practice thrift and frugality, and achieve the level of being thrifty to cultivate integrity and saving to help others. But we can further extend it to "restraining" personal desires and "controlling" one's own body and mind, and absolutely not doing anything that harms the country or depletes national strength. This is an extremely important condition for the future of winning the War of Resistance and building the nation. Fourth, let's talk about the word "shame." The original explanation is "earnest realization." Now, it should advance from earnest realization to "vigorous struggle." This meaning is even more obvious. For example, we realize that the most urgent need for the War of Resistance is the replenishment of soldiers, so we personally enlist or send our children to serve in the military. Or, we realize that the soldiers at the front lack certain items, so we immediately come out to promote donations and take the lead in donating as an example. Whenever there is a realization, there is a vigorous expression. Confucius said, "Knowing shame is close to courage." This word "knowing" naturally means realization, and this word "courage" naturally means the principle of vigorous struggle. Only in this way can we be considered truly enlightened and truly able to know shame as modern citizens.</p>
<p>Let us summarize the above-mentioned four virtues of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and sense of shame" with a more advanced meaning and put it into one sentence: every individual must be able to understand the needs of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, be loyal and courageous, and strive to fulfill their due responsibilities, without fearing any hardships or avoiding any sacrifices. Under strict discipline, create a widespread atmosphere throughout the country, and from our individual clothing, food, housing, and transportation to public service, all aspects of life should follow these four highest principles and truly manifest them. All our actions in wartime must be disciplined, responsible, clear about public and private matters, and uphold action. And in the interests of the country and the nation, we must absolutely not hesitate to sacrifice. This is the wartime interpretation of the four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and sense of shame. We must understand that our personal life and actions are inseparable from the interests of the country and the social atmosphere. We must always carefully examine the facts, recognize right and wrong, strive to be inspired, and practice personally, so that we can overcome the current difficulties and complete the work of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an important meaning. We advocate the New Life Movement to achieve the three effects of militarization, productionization, and rationalization by improving the life of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, improving the spirit of life is only a method, and achieving the effects of militarization, productionization, and rationalization is our ultimate goal. The New Life Movement has been around for five years. Our nation is at the critical moment of survival, and we need the national life to meet the requirements of the war in order to kill the enemy and defend the country. To enrich national strength, we need all the national labor to contribute to the construction of the wartime economy. In order to lay the foundation for national reconstruction in the process of War of Resistance, we need the people to advance from a scattered and selfish lifestyle to a cooperative and mutually supportive civil life. Therefore, we are now promoting the New Life Movement. On the one hand, we must actively expand the spirit of militarization, productionization, and rationalization from the life of each individual. On the other hand, we need all compatriots to actively participate and work together in the spirit of labor service to directly promote militarization, productionization, and other undertakings for the country and society. To give a few examples, first, for example, the current recruit training in various places. All people who are suitable for this training age, regardless of their identity, should automatically go to receive training. Second, for example, the personnel movement of the compilation and inspection of the Baojia system of local governments has always been done in the most unrealistic way, that is, because compatriots from all over the country are unwilling to take the initiative to contribute, so that it cannot be strict. From now on, no matter who it is, they should jointly help the Baojia chiefs to do these two kinds of mass organization and training affairs. They are all important work of "militarization." Recovering the enemy and eliminating traitors are entirely based on this. Third, what I said in my recent letter to the gentry and educators throughout the country, advocating various small handicrafts and developing local economic construction, should not only be advocated with all their talents and intelligence, but should especially supervise family members, women and children, and practice personally with surplus time and energy. Fourth, the central government is now stepping up the promotion of various construction projects in the economic and transportation of the southwestern and northwestern provinces and naturally needs a lot of human and financial support. Compatriots from all over the country should present capital, technology and capabilities as much as possible and enthusiastically participate in unison. These two items are the most important outline of our "productionization." Compatriots throughout the country must work together from top to bottom to know that we are now resisting the war. Of course, we must increase production as much as possible to enrich our necessary supplies, and we must also understand that after our future victory in the War of Resistance has been realized through this long-term war, many business institutions have suffered destruction by the violent enemy, and many compatriots' families and houses have suffered destruction by the violent enemy. At that time, the lives of our entire nation will inevitably become more difficult. To overcome this future difficulty, we rely on our early preparations and advance efforts today. In short, if we want to save the country and the nation from the current crisis, we can only immediately realize our militarized, productive, and rational life. This is the most urgent requirement of the current New Life Movement. All of you compatriots, every modern country must have a special national spirit. The New Life Movement is the reconstruction of our national spirit. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of the country. Militarization, productionization, and rationalization are the criteria for our national co-life. We grasp these two key points, unite with one heart, forge ahead bravely, and tighten all our life behaviors. This year is the year of progress for our New Life Movement. Everyone should promote our wartime life in this year, improve our strength in the War of Resistance, fully express our spirit of struggle and sacrifice, and create a new and glorious life for our nation with a 5,000-year history and culture.

Clark Kerr Issues More Severe Protest, Believing an Apology is Not Enough: British Press Increasingly Resolute in Their Tone: British Government Has a Certain Plan to Deal With Japanese Demands on the Shanghai International Settlement <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Ota, the Japanese Acting Consul in Hong Kong, visited Smith, the Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong, at 10 AM on the 23rd, to formally apologize on behalf of the Japanese government for the Japanese plane bombing incident in British territory. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese Head of Affairs today formally apologized to the British authorities for the bombing of British concession territory near Hong Kong by Japanese troops this week. After the incident, Sir A. Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, lodged a severe protest with the Japanese. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo immediately instructed the Japanese Consul to apologize to the British. (23rd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Express, Sir A. Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, will again lodge a strong protest with the Japanese government regarding the bombing of various locations within the Kowloon Concession by Japanese aircraft on Tuesday. This protest is a formal protest on behalf of the British government. If Japan is not prepared to voluntarily provide full compensation, it is already clear that this request will be made decisively in the protest. The correspondent also stated that the British government strongly disapproves of Japan's request for greater power to manage the affairs of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The British government's attitude towards this matter, like the Hong Kong issue, has been extremely resolute and cannot be accommodated. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers are commenting on the bombing of British territory near Hong Kong Island by Japanese planes. They say that the government has instructed Sir A. Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese government. The British government cannot accept the Japanese government simply apologizing, as the Japanese authorities in South China have done. It must further demand compensation for damages. The tone of the press towards Japan is becoming increasingly resolute. Generally, people feel that the British government has various methods to put pressure on Japan and force it to restrain itself. As for the nature of these methods, it can be imagined from the fragility of Japan's economic and commercial position as reported in various newspapers. The Times commented this morning on Japan's demands regarding the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement, saying that the British government has a "certain plan" to deal with it, but for Japan's sake, it would be best to avoid prompting Britain to implement this plan prematurely. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The London Times commented on the bombing of British territory near Shenzhen Village, Guangdong Province, China, by Japanese planes, saying, "As a result of the bombing, 11 civilians were killed and many were injured. Okazaki, the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong, has apologized to the British authorities, saying that this was an accident, which is 'regrettable.' This apology may not be entirely insincere, and it is not necessarily true. We cannot help but say that no country in the world wants its air force to openly expose its indiscipline or its incompetence. The fact that the Japanese air force bombed British territory must be either undisciplined or lacking in skill. The world knows that the British government has a certain plan for the Far East situation that it has been holding back, and this move by the Japanese may prompt Britain to implement it prematurely. This is probably not in Japan's best interest." (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here stated that reports received in London regarding the bombing of British territory near Shenzhen Village, Guangdong Province, China, by Japanese planes have proven that the responsibility for this case rests entirely with the Japanese side. Therefore, the government should instruct Sir A. Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, to demand compensation for damages from Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. If necessary, strong pressure should be put on the Japanese government to achieve this goal. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures here have stated that the British government has instructed Sir A. Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, to issue a new, more severe protest to Tokyo, emphasizing that the British government considers the bombing of Hong Kong territory by Japanese aircraft to be a serious matter. The apology of the Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou to the Governor of Hong Kong cannot resolve this matter. If Japan does not voluntarily compensate for the losses, Britain will make a firm demand for full compensation for the bombing. (23rd Haetong dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Sir A. Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, had already lodged an oral protest with the Japanese government after the bombing of British concession territory near Hong Kong Island. He has now been ordered to negotiate with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. It is rumored that he also requested compensation for damages, but it is not known whether he asked for guarantees that similar incidents would not happen again. Generally speaking, the ambassador requested an investigation and stated that the British government considered this case to be of a very serious nature. If similar incidents occur again, the British government will take other actions in addition to diplomatic protests. Regarding this matter, it is known here that the Japanese government is prepared to compensate for the damages, but London is not satisfied with this. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita invited Sir A. Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, to meet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:30 this morning to express his apologies for the accidental bombing near Shenzhen by Japanese aircraft. Well-informed Japanese circles here believe that the issue of compensation will now be raised. However, they expect that this issue and other incidents related to the bombing will be resolved quickly through negotiations between the local British and Japanese authorities. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Newspapers here are criticizing the Shanghai situation and expressing indignation at the Japanese claim that Japan should have greater administrative power over the International Settlement. They say that the responsibility for the assassinations in Shanghai, the acts of destroying law and order, and the lack of management in places where filth is hidden lies with the Japanese themselves. The Times commented on the serious situation in Shanghai, saying that the personnel employed by the Japanese are naturally considered traitors by patriotic Chinese. Seeing that those they protect are being assassinated one after another, the Japanese are greatly alarmed and take the despicable action of threatening the Shanghai Municipal Council, accusing the Municipal Council of lacking ability and sincerity. This kind of accusation is purely ridiculous, because the Japanese themselves maintain their own Chinese terrorist organizations within the International Settlement. Japanese Imperial Army officers, whether in uniform or in plain clothes, have broken into the Settlement and committed atrocities more than once. The facts are there and can be reviewed. The assassinations are occasional and not commonplace. This is due to the efforts of the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council has never received the cooperation of the Japanese. If the Japanese take over the Settlement, Shanghai will be in chaos within a week. The Manchester Guardian also has an editorial saying that the Shanghai Municipal Council is blameless. Its police force is strong and experienced, just like any place in the world. With the help of the volunteer corps, it has done its best to prevent disturbances and riots. Many Japanese who disguised themselves as Chinese terrorists and took provocative actions have been investigated, arrested and sent to their headquarters. The Municipal Council police only asked them to leave the Settlement. If Japanese soldiers enter the Settlement as police, it will create a serious crisis. The Daily Telegraph reported that the British government, in its protest to Tokyo regarding the bombing of the Hong Kong border, hopes that it will not forget that during the Japanese blockade, more than 10,000 fishermen, men, women, and children in Hong Kong were killed, and more than 600 sailing ships registered in Britain were sunk. When we recall the above facts, the Japanese demand that Japanese people have greater ruling power than they currently have over Shanghai's great concession for Western countries seems like an insult. The International Settlement will not be willing to let its remaining territory become as corrupt as the areas adjacent to the Japanese in Greater Shanghai. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Gu Weijun Speaks in France: China's Resistance Grows Stronger: 200 New Divisions of Troops Being Trained: Full-Scale Guerrilla Warfare Active: Japanese Morale Declining: Now a Reactive Force <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) According to Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to France, who spoke to the Associated Press today, Japan has not only gradually exposed its weaknesses in this Sino-Japanese War, but also China's guerrilla warfare is extremely successful. The Japanese army is killed by Chinese guerrillas at a rate of more than 20,000 per month. In addition, the Chinese government has 200 new divisions of troops in training, so China will soon launch a major counter-offensive. "After 18 months of war, the Chinese army has not only not weakened but has become stronger as it fights, while on the Japanese side, the signs of decline and exhaustion have become increasingly apparent. Since November of last year, the Japanese have had no large-scale military operations. In other words, their military operations have tended to stall, but during this period, the Chinese have recovered many cities, mostly in southwestern Shanxi Province. As for the two sides of the Yangtze River and the interior of the occupied areas, they are mostly firmly held by Chinese guerrillas, who constantly launch surprise attacks on the Japanese army's lines of communication. Therefore, the current Japanese army has lost its initiative and has fallen into a defensive predicament. Over time, it will be exhausted by the Chinese side. Therefore, from our perspective, final victory will belong to us without a doubt. This can be asserted not only from a military point of view, but also from a diplomatic point of view, because as of today, countries have gradually realized that Japan's aggressive ambitions are a great enemy of world peace, and therefore they are gradually changing their attitudes to find ways to deal with it." According to Dr. Gu, "In North China alone, the Japanese army suffers at least 20,000 casualties per month due to attacks by Chinese guerrillas. There are at least 300,000 to 400,000 Chinese guerrillas operating on the Japanese army's lines of communication in Hebei Province. In the entire occupied area, there are at least 2 to 3 million Chinese guerrillas operating behind the Japanese army. Because they often use the strategy of attacking the Japanese army in large formations, their military supplies are extremely abundant." (22nd AP dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e17">China's Revival: Linked to World Prosperity: Guo Taiqi Gives Speech <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Guo Taiqi said in a speech at the Chinese Association banquet tonight that China had gained a foothold in 1938, and even today, there is still reason for hope and trust. In 1939, China's position was stronger in both domestic and foreign affairs than in 1938. Although China's years of disaster have been extremely serious in material terms, they have not affected it spiritually. In the past year, China has lost several major cities and many coastal areas, but its development in the southwestern provinces has created a new nation with a vast territory sufficient to establish a country. He believes that the most exciting progress in the past year has been the common understanding of the East Asian issue and the awareness of the inevitable relationship between the international community and East Asia. What China knew in 1931, the world is only beginning to know in 1939. The unity of China in today's struggle is unprecedented in its positivity and thoroughness. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in his private telegram to London that the recently held meeting of the Central Committee was greatly encouraged by the trend of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States expressing a more active policy. Regarding this, the Soviet Union as a neighbor is also a stable and beneficial factor in the Sino-Japanese War. Although the development of southwest China cannot be achieved overnight, and various reforms are not without difficulties, the nation's determination not to yield is well known, and its creative talents are known throughout the world. China has not only trained new troops but also planned its strategies and organized its supplies for the second phase of the nationwide War of Resistance, guerrilla warfare, while also achieving such accomplishments in the southwest, which is truly inspiring. China certainly needs the assistance that outsiders can provide, but only if China progresses can the world have confidence. If China falls behind, the world will also regress. This is an inescapable truth in the current world politics. International free trade is the panacea for the future. When we try to restore international free trade in the future, is there any hope for international free trade without an independent China managing its huge trade? I am afraid that world prosperity will also come to a standstill because of this. In summary, China is the vanguard of the world's political survival and economic life, both today and in the future.

<h3 id="e20">Chamberlain's Speech: Current British Policy - Armed to Maintain Peace, Still Hoping to Establish International Trust and Jointly Eliminate the European War Crisis <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech last night in Blackburn, Lancashire. His wife also attended. Eight thousand people listened to the speech at the venue. Due to insufficient seating, several thousand people were unable to enter. When the Prime Minister and others entered the venue, the audience stood up and cheered for several minutes. Police maintained strict security outside the venue, and those without tickets were not allowed to enter. Women entering the venue had their purses inspected by the police to prevent bombs from being smuggled in. In his speech, the Prime Minister asked the nation to support the government's policy of "Maintaining Peace Through Strength." He mainly addressed domestic issues, such as unemployment and the status of the cotton industry, but also briefly touched upon foreign affairs and national defense, saying that during these uncertain times in international events, public attention is naturally focused on foreign politics and preparations for possible incidents. At this time, all parties are actively building up their military strength, and we cannot help but worry about the occurrence of unexpected events, even if the matter itself is very minor, the opportunity for war may break out because of it. We all know that once war breaks out, none of us can be sure that we will not be affected by it. Therefore, under these circumstances, only the reckless, irresponsible, or ignorant would want today's government to adopt a policy different from our established policy of "Maintaining Peace Through Strength." Our policy, on the one hand, does not neglect opportunities to dispel doubts and hostility, and on the other hand, with the help of the Empire and our friends abroad, resolutely creates a formidable force to safeguard our rights and freedoms and prevent them from being violated.</p>
<h3 id="e21">The Cost of Military Build-up is Alarming <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>National defense expenditures are increasing year by year. After the establishment of the national unity government, the initial national defense expenditure for each of the first five years was £11.4 million, but in the next fiscal year, it will increase to £580 million. This proves the effective progress of the British military preparation program. The cost of the military build-up is indeed shocking, but paying this price can bring comfort. Weighing the pros and cons, this is better than that. The delay in the production of armaments has now been quickly remedied. Warships, guns, airplanes, and ammunition are now being shipped out of shipyards and factories in a continuous stream, and the quantity is increasing daily. Therefore, today's situation is no longer the same as it was a few months ago. Since the development of air power, modern warfare has one completely new weapon, and the disaster of war has penetrated deep into the civilian population. We cannot provide civilians with absolute protection against air raids, but we can do something to reduce the effectiveness of air raids, prevent panic among the people, and ensure the maintenance of the nation's combat power.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Emphasis on Civil Defense <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister continued to describe the progress of civil defense, saying that some critics believe that the steel air-raid shelters, which cost £200,000 to build, cannot withstand a direct hit from a bomb. This object should be abolished and rebuilt as underground shelters that are extremely deep, so as not to be affected by bombs. However, a little consideration will show that this is not simple, because it is questionable whether it is possible to have the public enter extremely deep underground shelters during an air raid without causing disturbance and crowding, and it still needs to be discussed. In the event that the entrance to the deep shelter is directly hit by a bomb, there will be a large number of casualties. The government has not yet made a final decision on the method of deep underground air-raid shelters, but in the meantime, the method of shrapnel shelters can be carried out, because this type of equipment can be completed quickly, is not far away, and is also suitable for people to enter and exit before and after an air raid.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Encouraging Volunteer Service <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The patriotic men and women who automatically participate in national service are very grateful, and this move is beneficial to the country in three ways: (1) It shows the world that we can rely on a voluntary national service system without the need to adopt a compulsory system; (2) It boosts the courage of the people with the confidence that we know how to cope in the event of an emergency; (3) It helps prevent the outbreak of war, because the more prepared we are, the less likely others are to attack us. However, the country still needs more people for national service, and he hopes that the people will participate enthusiastically.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Military Expansion is for Self-Defense <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister then spoke of the cost of military build-up, saying that this huge figure makes us clearly understand the greatness of our financial strength. We can not only raise such a large sum of money, but also pay it with ease, without mentioning the trust in our financial foundation. What we are currently considering is only the efforts of the British mainland, without counting the donations that the British Dominions or comrades and friends outside the British Empire can give. Whenever we think of this, we always feel that Shakespeare's line, "When three-quarters of the world opposed, shall we affright them?" can be sung for us. He made this statement without any intention of boasting or invading others. Our military preparation does not endanger others, and we do not want to harm others. We have no other thoughts for any people in the world other than friendship. His most sincere wish in life is to see the establishment and maintenance of peace and trust. He believes that once trust has been slightly restored, we can work together to reduce armaments. The countries of the world will never frivolously waste huge sums of money. The reason why they are willing to spend money to increase armaments is because they fear that harm will come if they are unprepared. If this fear is removed, armaments will naturally be reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Seeking to Restore Trade Position <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister then spoke of the unemployment situation in Lancashire, saying that the main reason was the development of foreign competition from the East and Far East. He believes that the position that Lancashire previously occupied in the world cotton industry can never be restored, but we cannot simply sit back and do nothing. He advocated that the government and the cotton industry should work together in the following three aspects: (1) For all items that Britain can still produce in competition with competitors, efforts should be made to develop their trade. When Britain and the Dominions and other countries conclude various trade agreements, both the government and the public should keep this trade in mind, in order to obtain preferential treatment for this trade; (2) Reorganization of the Lancashire cotton industry to support this trade; (3) Transfer the enterprising spirit and adaptability of the British people to the development of new industries.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Finding Ways to Reduce Unemployment <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister finally spoke of the general unemployment problem, saying that a large proportion of the two million unemployed people registered last month had less than six weeks of work, and most of them worked intermittently without a fixed job. Those who have been genuinely unemployed for a long time are about 300,000 people or less. The government is currently setting up training centers in the hope of placing them. He believes that there is no reason to be pessimistic about the general career prospects or about export trade. The reason why British export trade cannot increase at present is the weakness of world purchasing power. However, the world still has a very large and latent demand for goods, but it has not been discovered due to the instability of international affairs. Once the situation returns to normal, this demand will rise.</p>

<p>For this reason, he is very pleased with the agreement recently concluded between the coal industries of Britain and Germany. After this agreement is concluded, representatives of general industries in Britain and Germany will also follow up with negotiations. Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Stanley, will visit Berlin next month to promote the habit of personal contact, which has achieved good results. Negotiating from mutually related businesses may be the best and fastest way to promote a better understanding between the two countries. He very much agrees with Hitler's statement last month that cooperation and mutual trust between the British and German people can bring happiness to the whole world. He sincerely hopes to add one more word, that nothing can help world peace more than trust. He acknowledges that trust cannot be produced in a day, and once trust is broken, it cannot be restored in a short time. However, he sincerely hopes that both sides will show goodwill to repair previous flaws. Today, the people of all countries in the world are looking forward to peace. Based on this point, he believes that the people of the world will eventually escape the mist of armaments and the fear of war and enter a brighter and more stable atmosphere that is in line with the true spirit of Christianity.

<h3 id="e28">British and French Interests are Closely Related; Britain Decides to Support France and Maintain Pressure on Italy <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(London) The cabinet held a routine meeting this morning, and immediately discussed the recent conversations between the British Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Perth, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ciano. It is reported that it has been decided that whenever the Italian press conducts anti-French propaganda, or whenever Italy violates the spirit of the Anglo-Italian agreement and takes various measures in terms of the army and navy, it should lodge representations with Rome, and maintain a kind of pressure for a long time, to prove that the interests of Britain and France are closely related. As for mediating, the British government will not do so without the consent of the French government. However, observers in diplomatic circles here generally say that if the relations between France and Italy become tense, Prime Minister Chamberlain, while declaring that he will definitely assist France, should also try to find a basis for talks between France and Italy. Those in charge say that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini does not intend to explain the nature and scope of the demands that France intends to make, in order to reserve room for the future. In short, Prime Minister Mussolini may not be willing to cause a major crisis under the current strained circumstances. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The relations between Britain and France, Germany, and Italy are currently attracting the attention of diplomatic observers here. It is expected that when Foreign Secretary Halifax answers Lord Anderson's questions in Parliament tonight, his statement on Anglo-French relations will be very important. Mr. Halifax met yesterday with the German Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Dirksen, to discuss various special items related to Britain and Germany. Regarding Anglo-Italian relations, the rumor that Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to take immediate action to respect Italy's demands on France does not seem to have been confirmed in any way. According to a Reuters diplomatic reporter, the British side's attitude towards this matter remains unchanged. The opinion held by Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax before their visit to Rome is that this matter should be directly negotiated by Italy and France, and efforts should be made to obtain reasonable concessions through negotiations. According to sources familiar with the situation, Britain cannot approve of any attempts to change the current situation in the western Mediterranean, and will use all its resources to resist any attacks on France or its major interests. These two points have already been made clear. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) During today's House of Commons session, Labour MP, Mr. Davison, asked whether the British government had received any concrete guarantees regarding the construction of an airplane field by the United States on the Mediterranean coast in the recent exchange of information between Britain and Italy. Under-Secretary Butler replied that some information was exchanged on January 10, but there was no issue of exchanging general guarantees, because there is no such provision in the Anglo-Italian agreement.

<p>(Paris) French Premier Daladier, while attending the American Club's Washington's Birthday celebration banquet tonight, said in an impromptu speech: "Tonight I must restate that France will never submit to armed intimidation or extortion schemes, and will not allow anyone to harm its hereditary property. As for the issue of our national territorial integrity, we French will stand firm against all threats, but are also willing to participate in any sincere efforts to limit and reduce armaments under an effective control plan."

<p>(Paris) U.S. Ambassador to France, Mr. Bullitt, delivered a speech at the Washington's Birthday memorial held at the American Club here tonight, stating, "The era of geographical isolation for the United States has completely passed. Today, for the sake of defending the democratic system, the United States has no choice but to prepare for war against countries that only know how to use force as national policy. In Washington's time, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans could indeed serve as America's supreme shields. Therefore, Washington established a policy of isolationism. But today, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are no longer sufficient to be the only shields. Therefore, our only policy of self-defense is to expand our military preparation so that we are prepared for any eventuality." (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Rome) According to official reports, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today guaranteed to the rebel leader, General Franco, that Italian troops will remain in Spain, fighting for the rebels until the rebels achieve final victory.

<p>(Paris) A right-wing newspaper recently published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent, stating that "The rumors of a meeting between the German leader Hitler, the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, General Franco, in Italy are rampant. Although the countries concerned may seemingly give informal denials, this matter is indeed being brewed behind the scenes. According to what informed sources know, the three giants of Italy, Germany, and Spain will meet in the city of Stresa in Italy within a short period of time. The Italian authorities have made arrangements in that area in order to hold gatherings at any time. Prime Minister Mussolini's guards, who have always protected the Prime Minister when he leaves the capital, have already received the Prime Minister's itinerary for escorting and guarding along the way."

<p>(London) Regarding the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist Army government as the legitimate government, well-informed sources here recently stated that the British government is eager to announce it on the same day as the French government, and that the date may be the 24th of this month. The talks conducted today between the British Ambassador to France, Mr. Phipps, and the French Foreign Minister, Mr. Bonnet, as well as the talks conducted between Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Butter, and the French Ambassador, Mr. Corbin, are related to this matter. It is reported that the British government's commercial representative stationed in Burgos, Mr. Hodgerson, has already submitted a report, stating that the Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, General Franco, has no intention of imposing collective retaliatory measures on the personnel of the Republican government, and that he will never tolerate the control of Spain by foreign forces. The British government is therefore quite satisfied. Once Prime Minister Chamberlain announces the recognition of the Nationalist Army government in the House of Commons on the 24th of this month, it will no longer recognize the Spanish Republican government as the legitimate government. However, according to diplomatic practice, the diplomatic representatives of the British stationed in the territory of the Spanish Republican government will still be able to enjoy diplomatic privileges within a few weeks.

<p>(Berlin) According to reports, the German Air Force has secretly created a balloon bombing team, which will soon be shown to the nation. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers yesterday revealed for the first time Germany's new anti-aircraft weapon, the "Camouflage Balloon," claiming that Germany had already used this new weapon during the tense European situation in September last year to protect the Lorna factory. According to a special correspondent from the "Berliner Illustrierte Nachtausgabe" (Berlin Illustrated Evening News) who personally visited the equipment, it was published in the newspaper yesterday, claiming that the "Camouflage Balloon" is a new weapon to protect German airspace, supplemented by a well-trained army, becoming an extremely effective anti-aircraft device. Experience has shown that setting up a radio net with bombs attached to the ground, using electricity to release it to attack incoming aircraft, is not only expensive, but also difficult to implement. Moreover, other countries may believe that there are money-powered nets that explode enemy aircraft, but in fact, few are effective, because this kind of iron wire explodes as soon as it comes into contact with dust and debris in the air, without waiting for the enemy aircraft to approach. Therefore, they are not effective anti-aircraft devices. As for Germany's "Camouflage Balloon," it can rise several kilometers into the air, but in practical applications, it does not need such a height, because for ten months of the year in Germany, the average cloud height is often below 3,000 meters, and only for the remaining two months is it above 3,000 meters. Aircraft bombing must fly low to be accurate, and night attacks are often the most common. Therefore, this "Camouflage Balloon" can be even more invisible. Air defense camouflage is divided into two types: "Camouflage Balloon" and "Connecting Balloon." After the balloon rises into the air, it is tied with a rope and directed from the ground by a winch to adjust the distance between the balloons. When the wind is strong, use the "Connecting Balloon." In this way, there is no danger of enemy aircraft rushing into the protected area. However, because the application method and effectiveness of this weapon are military secrets, they have not yet been made public. According to the newspaper, a field exercise of "Camouflage Balloons" will soon be held around Berlin. (Haitong Telegraph, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) According to reports from the Japanese side here, the Japanese-Soviet fisheries negotiations have once again reached a deadlock today, because after the Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and the Japanese Ambassador Togo Shigenori consulted, not only were there no results, but both sides ended the negotiations with frank words. Litvinov first indicated to the Japanese side that Moscow's plan has decided to auction the fishing grounds currently used by the Japanese in Vladivostok on March 15, and that there will be no changes. It is said that Togo then warned the Soviet Foreign Minister that the Japanese government will use any possible means to protect its fishing rights. Togo Shigenori, having received instructions from Tokyo, visited the Soviet Foreign Ministry this afternoon to continue his efforts to resolve the fisheries dispute, but was still unable to achieve his goal. Although the date for renewed negotiations has not been set, it is expected that there will be a possibility of renewed discussion. The Japanese ambassador also informed Litvinov that Japan will not participate in the fishing ground auction, and requested that these fishing grounds be temporarily set aside, and that the rights that the two countries should have should be determined by the two countries through negotiations. It is reported that both sides inquired about how public opinion in each country should express themselves on this fisheries issue. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the fisheries issue between Japan and the Soviet Union, Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Mr. Togo, visited Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov this afternoon and immediately issued a statement, saying that the Soviet government's proposal to distribute the fishing grounds currently operated by the Japanese through voting is unacceptable to the Japanese government. If the current negotiations fail, the Japanese government intends to take necessary measures to protect its interests. Litvinov also replied that a certain Japanese newspaper recently published a report saying that the Japanese government, when necessary, should send warships to protect fishing boats. If Japanese fishermen enter Soviet territorial waters after the failure of such negotiations, causing incidents, then trying to view it as a local event and letting it have extremely serious impacts would be impossible. The two sides confronted each other, each refusing to yield, but they agreed to conduct negotiations quickly in order to establish a solution. Informed sources here commented that the Soviet government's policy on this issue is the same as the policy it pursued when the Zhanggufeng Incident occurred, that is, to maintain peace as the best policy.

<h3 id="e40">U.S. House of Representatives Engaged in Heated Debate, Supporting Fortifications on Guam, Unanimously Acknowledging Japan as America's Potential Enemy, Senate Army Committee Revises Military Expansion Bill <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives continued its discussion today on the bill to add naval air bases, with particular emphasis on the construction of an air base on Guam. The discussion lasted for six hours. Many Republican representatives expressed their support. Isaac Lee, a Democratic representative from California, stated that the United States had intended to establish defenses on Guam even before the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. Now that Japan has declared the treaty null and void, the United States is no longer bound by it. At this point, a Republican representative asked whether the United States should defend its border on the Rhine River. Isaac replied, "Yes" (the Democrats applauded). "A certain country is preparing to defend this border on behalf of the United States, which we can greatly benefit from." Other representatives from both parties, including Mr. Marks, the leader of the Naval Committee, then spoke, stating that the construction of an airfield on Guam would greatly benefit civilian aviation. In terms of air power, the island is not far from Japan, and any movements of the Japanese navy can be detected and reported to the U.S. fleet in a timely manner, preparing it to respond. The communication lines between the United States and the Dutch East Indies (the source of rubber necessary for American industry) would also be easier to defend (the representatives all applauded). Several representatives then spoke, stating that Japan is a potential enemy of the United States. Now that it has formed an understanding with Germany and Italy, the U.S. government must consider the possibility of a simultaneous attack by Japan, Germany, and Italy. The construction of an airfield on Guam would facilitate American defense, and such a good opportunity should not be missed. Representative Shannon from Missouri, although a Democrat, expressed his opposition, stating that "After the outbreak of war, the Philippine Islands failed to enhance American power and instead became a burden to the United States. The islands are located on Japan's path of expansion into the tropics. Although rich in resources, they are not defended. The United States will one day go to war with Japan over control of the islands. The country intends to plunder the Far East and establish hegemony, which will not be hindered by anything. The Manchurian Incident serves as a warning." Observers here commented on the discussion, saying that the bill to add naval air bases is expected to pass without amendment (Havas dispatch, 22nd).</p>
<p>(Washington) After the military expansion bill was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday with a vote of 367 to 15, it has been sent to the Senate Army Committee for review. The committee has completed its review of the air force portion of the bill and unanimously passed an amendment proposing to increase the funds needed for air force equipment (including funds to strengthen air defenses in the Panama Canal Zone) from $300,000,000 to $358,000,000, and to increase the number of aircraft to be built from 3,032 to 3,532. In other words, the total number of U.S. Air Force aircraft will be increased to 6,000 (Havas dispatch, 22nd).</p>

<p>(New York) According to the American Institute of Public Opinion, the results of recent opinion polls show an important trend in American public opinion toward abandoning its traditional isolationist policy.

<h3 id="e42">Germany, Italy, and Japan Military Alliance, Japanese Moderates Deeply Fear Being Drawn into European War Vortex <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: At a closed-door meeting of the House of Peers on February 17 to discuss the budget, former ambassador to the United States, Katsuzo Debuchi, representing the moderates, expressed his opinion, stating that the Japanese government may expand the scope of the Anti-Comintern Pact under the pretext of strengthening it. As a result, Japan will be mechanically bound by whatever intentions Germany and Italy may have in the future. For example, if a conflict occurs in the Mediterranean, Japan will also be drawn into the vortex. This is worrying, he said. Prime Minister Hiranuma replied that the military agreement drafted by Japan, Germany, and Italy to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact is only aimed at the Third International. Foreign Minister Arita also made the same assurance. The Japanese moderates, upon hearing this, felt that the Prime Minister's reply was very important. The moderates still cannot help but be concerned about the results that may be achieved in the negotiations to strengthen the Third International Pact. According to reliable sources, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop of Germany, Foreign Minister Ciano of Italy, Ambassador Shiratori of Japan to Italy, and Ambassador Oshima to Germany had drafted a treaty of alliance in December of last year. At that time, the Konoe cabinet was originally prepared to sign it, but later hesitated because it realized that after the alliance was established, Japan would have to target both Soviet Russia and Britain and France. Later, Konoe resigned, and those who advocated a new foreign policy in Japan believed that Prime Minister Hiranuma should sign a general, unreserved treaty of alliance with Germany and Italy. Unexpectedly, Prime Minister Hiranuma did not agree. Political figures here also said that the various political parties in Japan have reportedly reached an agreement in principle, advocating that Germany, Italy, and Japan sign a minimum mutual assistance agreement against the Third International, and that Germany, Italy, and Japan continue to consult in order to formulate a compromise plan, either in the form of a treaty or an annex, stipulating that Germany and Italy obtain certain assistance from Japan under certain specific circumstances, but without explicitly mentioning the words "Soviet Union" or "Third International". In short, the Japanese moderates are extremely cautious about the proposal of a military alliance, while the radicals are exerting pressure on the Hiranuma cabinet to urge it to sign resolutely. This proves that the Japanese authorities are already aware of the seriousness of the European situation (dispatch, 23rd).</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In order to conserve metal raw materials needed for the war against China, the government has decided to issue millions of aluminum subsidiary coins and withdraw the copper-nickel coins currently in circulation. The government will allocate 52 million yen in this year's budget to mint new subsidiary coins.

<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo is currently suffering from a coal shortage. According to people in the industry, even if they pay three times the price they paid two months ago, they cannot obtain a source. The reasons are: (1) there have been heavy snowstorms near northern Japan, preventing products from Hokkaido mines from being shipped out; (2) the Japanese naval authorities, because the fisheries dispute between Japan and the Soviet Union has brought relations between the two countries to the brink of crisis, have requisitioned all sources of coal; (3) rumor-mongers say that the Japanese fleet is now concentrated in the northern sea, preparing to deal with any eventuality. But whatever the real reason, many families in Tokyo have adopted the habit of abandoning evening baths or switching to cold water baths, and even coal for household heating is extremely difficult to buy (Reuters dispatch, 21st).</p>
<h3 id="e44">China Deposits Huge Amounts of Silver in England, Last Year it was Transferred to the U.S. <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(London) It was announced here today that the amount of money spent by Britain abroad last year was 55 million pounds more than the amount received. In 1937, it was 56 million pounds. According to the total trade and government transactions that can be seen last year, there was a shortage of 390 million pounds. This is a decrease of 56 million pounds compared to 1937. The Ministry of Commerce estimates that this progress will be offset by the decrease in invisible income, so the final figure will still be comparable to the figure recorded in 1937. However, well-informed circles are quite skeptical of the Ministry of Commerce's estimate that investment income decreased by 10 million pounds last year, and the inclusion of silver flows in the item is also criticized. This flow is mostly because the Chinese government transported silver worth many trillions of pounds to England for safekeeping in 1937, and then transported it from England to the United States last year, so it has nothing to do with Britain's receipts and payments and should not be included. If silver is removed, the 55 million pounds spent more last year will increase to 65 million pounds. However, due to the huge expenditure on rearmament, even this number is not surprising (Reuters dispatch, 23rd).</p>

<p>(Berlin) A government-controlled Nazi newspaper stated today that the United States and Germany may sever relations in diplomatic and commercial aspects.

<p>(London) Although both sides of the Atlantic Ocean have made great efforts to investigate the sinking of an unnamed ship in the Atlantic Ocean after receiving the distress call from the stricken vessel, no clues have been obtained as of late at night. The American merchant ship Tulsa reported to Chatham, Massachusetts, that it had received a distress call from a ship claiming to be the Pecc, which was said to have been torpedoed by a submarine of unknown nationality 200 miles south of the Azores. It is speculated here that Pecc is the radio call sign of the ship in distress, but London has no way of knowing which ship this call sign belongs to. Later, the British Portishead radio station announced that in a distress call it received, it was stated that the hull of the ship that had been shelled by a submarine had been holed and was sinking, and that help was urgently needed (Reuters dispatch, 22nd).</p>
<p>(London) What ship was sunk by a submarine in the Atlantic Ocean has not yet been determined. It is widely speculated that the ship is the British oil tanker "Peck," which left Trinidad on February 8 and should have arrived in Southampton on February 27. Efforts have been made to communicate with the ship, but without success (Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3 id="e48">Japanese Planes Tragically Bomb the Leizhou Peninsula, Japanese Troops Invading Qiongzhou Already Facing Difficulties, Therefore West River Troops are Transferred to Qiongzhou to Assist in the Battle <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Qiongyai war is still developing. After occupying Qiongshan County, the Japanese army in Haikou advanced in three routes. The Chinese army gathered teams and blocked the Japanese army north of Ding'an. The central route of the Japanese army invaded Ding'an and was blocked between Longtang and Shiqiao. It was once ambushed in a cave in Longtang, with 600 to 700 casualties. The right wing spied on Chengmai and is currently confronting the Chinese army in Anren. The left wing plans to exit Wenchang and encountered the Chinese army in the Sanjiang area. There are many rivers and creeks in the area, making it difficult for Japanese tanks to move. Aircraft from Japanese aircraft carriers have been flying to Ding'an, Wenchang, Chengmai, and the city center for days, lightly bombing undefended civilian residences, burning them all day long, and turning prosperous markets into scorched earth. As for the Japanese warships on the sea north of Qiongzhou, they are docked at Puqian Port (located east of Haikou City), Lingao Port (west of Haikou City), and Xiaoying Port. There is also a flagship with four smokestacks docked near Haikou. Vice Admiral Kondo of the Japanese Navy is reportedly commanding on the ship. More than a dozen ships have recently been transferred to Yulin Port in southern Qiongzhou to invade Sanya and spy on Yaxian. The Japanese army's move is an attempt to contain the Chinese army resisting in northern Qiongzhou in southern Qiongzhou, and on the other hand, to occupy a certain place in Yaxian to operate an air base in order to control the Nanyang shipping lane and threaten the land and water traffic from French Vietnam to Guangxi. The former has a smaller impact on military strategy, while the latter is related to international issues and seems to have a conspiracy to launch simultaneously with Germany and Italy in Central Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army landed in Qiongyai, the third country most affected was French Annam and Guangzhou Bay. The waterway from Annam to Beihai has long been blocked since Weizhou Island was occupied by the Japanese army. Only the land route from Annam to Longzhou, Guangxi, can still be traveled as usual. The Japanese army plans to control the route by air, so it is eager to occupy Yaxian to open up a safe airfield. As for Guangzhou Bay in France, it is only separated by the Leizhou Peninsula, which is the current location of the Japanese fleet gathering in Haikou, and the restrictions are even more profound. The French fleet in Annam, in addition to a few ships heading to Haikou to protect expatriates, will, if necessary, sail to Guangzhou Bay to protect French interests. The French consul in Guangzhou Bay has also been ordered to pay attention to the actions of the Japanese army and report to the French government at any time. On the 12th, the Jiangsu steamer, which arrived in Guangzhou Bay from Hong Kong, stopped for half a day before heading to Haiphong in the afternoon. There are many refugees gathered in Guangzhou Bay in recent days, and prices are expensive and rents are soaring. However, since the Jinghao alarm occurred in Qiongyai, the counties in the southern district have been placed under martial law, and the roads leading to Guangzhou Bay have been completely destroyed. At present, traffic is greatly hindered, and the prosperity of the bay has been affected again.</p>
<p>The Leizhou Peninsula, which is adjacent to Guangzhou Bay, includes Xuwen and Haikang counties. Since Japanese warships have sailed into the Leizhou Strait, they have regarded Xuwen and Haikang as items in their bags. At the moment, because Qiongzhou Island has not been completely occupied, there is no time to transfer troops to commit crimes in Leizhou. Only Japanese planes are dispatched to fly up and arrive in Xuwen and Haikang, so that residents in these places cannot escape. Therefore, the above-mentioned two places have suffered tragic air raids in recent days, with heavy casualties. On the 10th of the month, 30 to 40 residents in Xuwen were bombed to death by Japanese planes, and more than 100 houses were burned. The county government, county middle school, and county hospital were all destroyed. On the 11th, the county seat was bombed again. On the same day, the Niaoshi Port of Haikang was hit by three bombs by Japanese planes, killing 10 residents and injuring 6 or 7 people.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's invasion of Qiongyai is said to have been transferred from Taiwan, but the number of troops is only said to be 10,000. However, the area of Qiongyai is vast, and it is not easy for the Japanese army to gain a foothold without going deep. If they want to go deep, it is not easy for 10,000 people to cope with it. Therefore, it has been transferring a unit of troops stationed in the West River of Guangdong Province to Qiongyai for reinforcement for days. It is said that no less than 4,000 to 5,000 people have been secretly evacuated in two batches. The Japanese defense area in the West River in recent days only takes an offensive defense, and the troops are concentrated in the Sanshui Hekou area, about 2,000, led by the Japanese commander Kinkawa. A unit stationed on the front line of Langgang once sent a team of hundreds to disturb the Qingqi French Bank on the 12th, but was repelled by the Chinese army. As for the Jiujiang area, there are currently only hundreds of Japanese troops, and the artillery tightly guards the defensive fortifications, firing artillery shells at Helao and other places in Heshan from time to time to prevent Chinese guerrilla troops from attacking. On the 13th, artillery was fired all day long. It was reported that more than 1,000 guerrillas had sneaked into Helao Shaping and were taking action. In addition to shelling Helao, the Japanese army also sent planes to bomb Shaping Market, destroying dozens of shops. In addition, Longkou Township in Heshan was also hit by more than 30 bombs, and the residents had all fled. The Chinese army in the West River, because the Japanese army was transferred to Qiongzhou, is now actively deploying a counter-offensive military. The troops of Xiawei in the West River have been deployed to increase defense. The Fourth War Zone Command recently transferred two divisions of Deng Longguang's troops to Zhaoqing, Sanshui, Qingqi, Gaoming, and Heshan. Army Commander Deng Longguang has gone from Shaozhou to the West River and will take command on the front line. The troops of the West River Commander-in-Chief Xiawei are also moving eastward from Sihui and Zhaoqing to link up with the vanguard (February 18).</p>
<h3 id="e49">Changsha Refugees Gradually Return to the City, Talk by the President of Xiangya Hospital, Industrial Cooperative Movement is Quite Active <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Dalu Daily reported that Dr. Green, acting president of Xiangya Hospital in Changsha and professor of surgery at Xiangya Medical College, recently arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday (21st), he told reporters that today's Changsha gives people the impression of a prosperous county seat. Of course, the streets do not have the appearance of being wealthy, but most people have built huts and shelters for themselves and have begun to do various handicrafts to make a living. Since the great fire in Changsha last November, people have been returning to the city in droves, with more than 100,000 people staying behind, of which about 40% were originally from Changsha, and the rest were mostly refugees from Jiangxi, and most of them were from poor classes. When Dr. Green left Changsha, there were about 7,000 destitute refugees in the area. The National Government and the Provincial Government had been actively sending refugees in the city to live in the countryside before the fire, so the refugee camps in the city were all empty when the fire broke out, so it is easier to recover today. The industrial cooperative movement in Hunan Province is quite active. This work is divided into rural and industrial forms. The rural cooperative process is currently being carried out in western Hunan, where the population is usually extremely sparse. The leader has tried to divide the land and cattle and sheep in the area to refugees, hoping to establish a permanent career. The government is also carrying out a reforestation plan in western Hunan, allocating 7,000 mu of land to plant trees from Sichuan. Eastern Hunan, including Changsha, is carrying out industrial cooperation. The relief work in the suburbs of Changsha is mostly handled by the city's International Relief Committee. The industrial cooperative knows that the best thing to do is to lend money to the people, so it lends money to those who are sure they can repay it. The products of the cooperative are becoming more and more refined and profitable. The principal can be recovered in three or four months. There are many local buyers of its products, so they are often in short supply. The fact that people can quickly get out of the refugee class is very interesting to see. Hunan Province is now extremely short of medicines. Before Guangzhou fell, goods could be transported by rail via Hong Kong, but now they must be transported via Shanghai, Ningbo, or Wenzhou and Jinhua. The Red Cross branches have given great assistance in transporting medicines. The concern and assistance of the people of Shanghai with medicines is very valuable. If there are no outside donations, they will not be able to continue their work. The American Advisory Committee for Civilian Relief has donated 30,000 yuan to purchase and distribute medicines to Hunan Province. Now the situation in Changsha is getting better and better, and the people are gradually becoming more stable again. Dr. Green also recounted his experience of being bombed in Xiangtan. At 11 a.m. on February 6, when they were about to arrive in Xiangtan, the train driver suddenly heard an alarm and stopped immediately. The passengers all ran off the train and hid in the fields. Japanese planes dropped four bombs within 50 yards of the train. Although they did not hit, one bomb fell behind the train, and the train caught fire and burned. After the Japanese planes flew away, he climbed into the burning train from the train window to rescue objects, causing burns to his face and back, which have not yet healed. In that air raid, one person was killed and several were injured. The work of repairing the railway was very fast, and it was completely repaired in half an hour. Less than 40 minutes after the air raid, Red Cross personnel had rushed from Nanchang to the bombed site to provide assistance. Dr. Green will stay in Shanghai for another two weeks or so.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Miraculous Recovery for Weak Men After Marriage <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Wishing You Health and Eternal Happiness</p>
<p>In principle, married life can improve health because it brings balance to both mind and body, and joy to the spirit. How beneficial is joy to our health! As the saying goes, "A hearty laugh adds a thousand pounds of strength." It is also said, "Anger and annoyance cause illness, while joy and happiness prolong life." Because joy is sufficient to promote our digestion and blood circulation, and especially to aid our metabolism, a strong man who marries late may experience physiological problems because of the loneliness of life and the unhappiness of spirit, which manifests as disorders of the nervous system. If he marries, this phenomenon can gradually disappear and return to a healthy state. Therefore, doctors say that late marriage and being an only child are both unsuitable. Furthermore, in biological studies, we know that some animals even die because they cannot find a mate! However, in today's reality, many relatives, friends, neighbors, and general patients lose their health after marriage, especially middle-aged husbands. The most common symptom in these people is neurasthenia. Some have very weak cerebral nerves, often experiencing brain swelling, headaches, tinnitus, blurred vision, forgetfulness, and insomnia. Some have weak spinal nerves, often experiencing back pain, soreness in the limbs, and feeling extremely tired after slight exertion. Some have weak sexual nerves, often experiencing nocturnal emissions, or even spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency, impotence, and dissipated energy. In addition, some may experience anemia, weight loss, sudden weight gain, alternating chills and fever, night sweats, palpitations, timidity, fear of cold and heat, and reluctance to face challenges. Such men not only fail in their careers because they cannot continue to work hard, often falling into despair or even tragically failing at the last hurdle, but also often feel impotent in their sexual lives with their wives, leading to dissatisfaction and family disputes. In recent times, there have been frequent reports in society of wives having affairs, eloping, or even openly seeking divorce, and the main reason for this lies in this issue. What a tragic thing! Why do men become weak and impotent after marriage? According to doctors, it is mostly due to early masturbation and nocturnal emissions, or excessive indulgence in sexual desire after marriage, or fatigue and injury caused by the pressures of life, leading to depletion of essence and blood, and weakening of the nerves. The only remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin," which is most effective for this condition. This medication can produce semen and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within one day and night after taking it. Continued use will completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time and further improve the health of the body. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Schmidt's Semen-Conserving Tablets" to strengthen the seminal gates and stop emissions, which will yield even faster results! If patients can come to our clinic in person and receive diagnosis by expert physicians, followed by electrotherapy, injections, and other symptomatic treatments, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3 id="e52">The Relationship Between Breasts, Health and Beauty, and Emotions <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA</p>
<p>○ Ladies who seek health and beauty and passion must not neglect your breasts ○ In medical terms, the healthy development of breasts depends on the proper function of the ovaries. The most obvious sign of this healthy function is the erectness of the breasts, with nipples of a sandalwood color, like the spires on top of cone-shaped towers. The two peaks stand side by side on the chest, with a deep valley in between, seemingly inviting and fascinating. As for the emotional aspect, it is also due to the influence of developed sexual function, often resulting in tenderness, happiness, sensitivity, and passion. Therefore, women's breasts are not only valuable in terms of physical beauty but also greatly related to inner emotions. As a result, European and American women often pay attention to maintaining the development of their breasts in order to express their health, beauty, and passion. If they are not satisfied, they take the ovarian preparation "Gonadin" for women to nourish them and allow them to fully develop. However, when we look back at Chinese women, they have not paid attention to breasts at all, and some even bind their chests to make them shriveled, which is completely unreasonable! As for those who have diseases such as irregular menstruation or vaginal discharge that impair ovarian function, leading to breast atrophy, facial aging, and premature aging, these phenomena are even more common. Therefore, in Chinese families, it often leads to weak feelings between husband and wife, a relationship in name only, even like enemies. Although they still have sons and daughters, the race is weakening day by day. Not only is their life extremely painful, but it also causes great harm to society and the country! The only remedy, according to my clinical experiments, is to take the ovarian preparation "Gonadin" for women, which is the most effective for the symptoms. Moreover, due to the physique of Chinese people, a smaller dose can be used, and the results are better than those of foreigners. This medicine can nourish the ovarian function and increase metabolism within one day and night after taking it. Continued use will completely cure the above-mentioned hidden diseases of women in a short period of time, making the breasts gradually erect, the cheeks moisturized, enhancing health and beauty, and creating full love between husband and wife. Ladies who seek health and beauty and passion! Here is your savior!</p>

<p>Gonorrhea is a fierce demon that destroys sexual function.</p>
<p>Only highly skilled surgery and electrotherapy can achieve a complete cure in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Because the lesions of leukorrhea are mostly located in the reproductive system, it is very easy to damage sexual function. Among the symptoms of gonorrhea, gonococcal prostatitis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, and vasitis are the most common. These organs all occupy important positions in the reproductive system. For example, prostatic fluid has the effect of nourishing sperm, testicles have the effect of producing sperm, and seminal vesicles have the function of storing sperm. The vas deferens has the function of transporting sperm for fertilization. If one organ is affected, our reproductive function will be immediately threatened. These conditions cannot be fully treated with local surgery or ordinary inferior medicines on the market. Because the bacteria penetrate deep inside, simply relying on surface local surgery cannot directly reach the lesion, resulting in ineffective treatment. And ordinary inferior medicines on the market are more harmful than beneficial. Because these inferior medicines all claim to be able to cure the disease completely within a few days, they actually have a hegemonic effect of harming the stomach and kidneys. Therefore, patients who seek the most rapid and thorough treatment must adopt German Filtral Electric Therapy, which allows electricity to directly penetrate the lesion and filter the toxins produced by gonococci. Only this kind of treatment can be called a complete eradication, and with the assistance of surgery to correct it, the disease can be cured and reproductive function can be restored.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Japanese Demand Disclosure, Plan to Expand Police Power in the Concession, Municipal Council is Studying Their Reply, Situation in Shanghai Not Yet Serious, Britain Expresses Resolve Not to Compromise <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>In view of the shooting incidents occurring within the concession, the Japanese side has blamed the inadequate police force in the concession and submitted a formal written protest to Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the day before yesterday. It is understood that this written document was jointly signed by Sakurai, Commander of the Japanese Army Garrison, Kashiwado, Naval Commander, and Miura, Japanese Consul General. The content of the protest has been refused to be disclosed by both the Municipal Council and the Japanese side. However, according to a Japanese spokesperson, the protest contains four demands, namely: (1) the arrest of terrorists; (2) the expansion of the Japanese police force in the Municipal Council; (3) the reorganization of the Municipal Council; (4) the reservation of the right for the Japanese army to take extensive measures within the concession when necessary. The Japanese side also stated that to avoid international disputes, they do not want to take any severe actions for the time being, but they will definitely achieve the goal of increasing the number of Japanese police officers. According to foreign sources, the main purpose of this Japanese protest is to increase the number of Japanese police officers. The Municipal Council is currently considering how to respond, but it is found that the number of Japanese police officers has been repeatedly expanded since the Shanghai War, and their total number has reached more than four hundred, not far from the number of British and American police officers. Therefore, in fact, the Japanese side has no reason to request further increases. Moreover, the powers of Japanese police officers are mostly limited to protecting the safety of Japanese residents, and their responsibilities are not very heavy. Even if the number is further increased, it will not help the overall security situation. Furthermore, the concession's police force is very strong and sufficient to cope with everything with ease. Therefore, according to observations from various sources, this Japanese demand is obviously inappropriate and will hardly be understood by the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd. Morishima, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, has recently reported the situation of the Shanghai Public Concession to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Morishima will fly back to Shanghai with Arita's instructions in about one or two days.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council is Studying the Content</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, Mr. Phillips, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, replied to reporters' inquiries last night (22nd), saying that the Japanese Consul had visited the Chairman of the Municipal Council and raised several protests related to the recent acts of violence in the Public Concession. The Council will study these protests and reply to the Japanese authorities, but it is unable to make any statement at this time.</p>
<p>Four Demands Reported in Tokyo</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun," after the successive cases of assassinating key figures of the "Reformed Government" occurred in the Shanghai Public Concession, the Japanese government instructed the Japanese authorities in Shanghai to make the following four demands to the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday: (1) Arrest Chinese terrorist activists; (2) Strengthen the Japanese influence in the Municipal Council; (3) Increase the number of Japanese police officers; (4) Fundamentally reorganize the Municipal Council. In addition, the Japanese government stated that it reserves the right to take any "extensive measures."</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Did Not Demand an Increase in Directors</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun once reported yesterday that the demands made by the Japanese side to the Municipal Council included increasing the number of Japanese directors and fundamentally reorganizing the Police Department of the Municipal Council. This statement is incorrect and has been officially denied by the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Disclosure of Japanese Conditions</p>
<p>The China Press reported that only six hours after the patrol team was attacked by bandits in the Japanese-controlled area, representatives from the Japanese Army, Navy, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted several "demands" to the Municipal Council yesterday (22nd) afternoon. The detailed nature of these "demands" has not yet been disclosed. However, news from the Japanese side last night claimed that these demands are very similar to the application submitted by the Japanese Army Special Affairs Department to the Municipal Council after the Japanese army was bombed during the "victory parade" on December 3rd of the year before last. According to the previous application, it was intended to greatly increase the number of Japanese police officers in the Public Concession Police Department, but it was not accepted by the Municipal Council. Yesterday's demands were made when the Japanese Consul General Miura met with Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Municipal Council, along with senior officers from the Japanese Army and Navy. It was learned last night that the Japanese representatives and Mr. Fessenden had agreed on measures to prevent the recurrence of terrorist cases in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>When the Japanese side received reporters from various newspapers last night, a public statement was issued, stating that in view of the recurrence of terrorist violence in Shanghai, the Japanese Army, Navy, and consular authorities submitted a written request to Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Municipal Council, at 3:00 PM today (22nd), requesting the Council to agree to take effective measures to deal with the current situation. After visiting Mr. Fessenden, the Japanese representatives also visited the commanders of the British and Italian garrisons to inform them of the request made to the Council. The spokesperson also said that in addition to this public statement, he could not add</p>
<p>Any Information</p>
<p>It is said that Japanese representatives did not visit the U.S. defense army authorities or the French Concession authorities. However, while the Japanese authorities were consulting with Mr. Fessenden, they had already taken action on their own, deploying about twenty armed puppet police officers to the Singapore Road not far from the place where Li Hongtao was shot. Puppet police officers were also stationed on the road directly south of the Public Continental Cotton Mill, paying attention to that area</p>
<p>Suburban Villages and Towns</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, when a senior officer of the Police Department arrived at the area, the puppet police were still stationed on both sides of the road and did not search vehicles. However, it was heard that puppet police had been stationed there before. This is an illegal act on the roads of the concession. Japanese military police also stationed on Yangshupu Road yesterday, conducting searches on both foreigners and Chinese. Yesterday, Japanese newspapers in Shanghai paid</p>
<p>Special Attention to Unexpected Incidents</p>
<p>They continued to pay special attention, and once again referred to the Public Concession Police Department, one of the world's most effective police organizations, as being unable to cope with the situation, and attempted to justify the entry of Japanese military patrol teams into the area south of Suzhou Creek as a legitimate act. Police Department personnel did not seem to pay much attention to the shooting incident at the exhibition, saying that this case had absolutely no</p>
<p>Political Nature</p>
<p>of any kind. The Police Department believed that the current situation was not as alarming as some parties imagined. During the anniversary of the war in July last year, about twenty shooting and bombing cases occurred in the Public Concession. The only recent unexpected incident in the Public Concession that was related to the Japanese side was the case of the</p>
<p>Japanese Person Shot</p>
<p>on Nanjing Road on Sunday afternoon. Yesterday, the Japanese-language Continental News in Shanghai published an editorial, continuing to vehemently criticize the Municipal Council, and said that the Council was not prepared to bear the responsibility of "destroying the foundation of the new order in East Asia."</p>
<p>It is Not True that Japanese Troops Have Entered the Central District</p>
<p>Around 9:30 yesterday morning, a Japanese officer led four armed Japanese soldiers to the Nissin Steamship Company on the Bund of Guangdong Road (i.e., Wuma Road) in the Public Concession. At that time, two Japanese soldiers closely followed the officer, and two were temporarily on guard at the entrance of the Nissin Steamship Company. However, outsiders did not notice and mistakenly reported that Japanese soldiers had entered the central district. However, the Japanese officer and the four soldiers later returned by the same route, and the group of doubts completely dissipated. The following Japanese soldiers were only similar to guards. However, it is understood that stock trading in the market at that time fell by one yuan due to unfounded rumors, which can be said to be self-disturbance and completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that this morning (23rd), it was rumored that Japanese sentries had been stationed in front of the Baker Building (transliteration) at the corner of Guangdong Road on the Bund, causing the prices of many stocks on the stock exchange to fall. Japanese sentries were indeed stationed there, but the fact is that they were the guards of a Japanese general who was going to the Nissin Steamship Company and Osaka Shosen Kaisha offices in that building. Four guards were outside, waiting for the general to finish his talks. At that time, there were many onlookers.</p>
<p>Search of Shanghai College</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that starting at 6:00 yesterday morning (22nd), British, Italian, and garrison troops, Japanese military police, and the Police Department cooperated to begin a large-scale search unprecedented in Shanghai's history. Over 700 people set up a cordon around the area from Route Dufour in the north, to the riverbank along Jessfield Park in the south, to a wide alley fifty yards east of Jessfield Park in the east, and to Alley 181 of Route Dufour in the west, lasting for one hour. Although it was believed that armed criminals were hiding in it, about 300 thatched sheds were also searched, but the result was nothing. The participants in the search were divided into twenty teams, and 70 Police Department constables were stationed at key points to prevent possible escapes. The first search was conducted at</p>
<p>Jessfield Park</p>
<p>beginning at an alley fifty yards east of Jessfield Park, along Route Dufour. The temporary headquarters of the commanders of the garrisons was also located in that alley. When the scheduled action began, ten teams entered the search area from Alley 161 of Route Dufour, conducting a fan-shaped operation, advancing toward the center of the area to be searched. The other ten teams also operated in</p>
<p>Similar Fashion</p>
<p>from an alley next to Brenan Road, advancing toward the center. Before the search began, British and Italian soldiers gathered at the central location, armed with live ammunition and fixed bayonets. Chinese constables from each police station also gathered near the area in patrol vehicles at night. At dawn, at the scheduled start time, at 5:55, all teams reached their destinations and</p>
<p>Began the Search</p>
<p>Each of the twenty teams, including Police Department constables, puppet police, and Japanese military police, consisted of fourteen people. Other police teams were stationed at each end of the area to prevent bandits from escaping. Four deputy inspectors of the Police Department's reserve team each carried a light machine gun. The purpose of the search was to arrest armed bandits. Each searched house was marked with a special chalk mark to prevent other teams from re-inspecting it. However, as a result of the search, no guns or obvious bandits were found.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Willing to be Subordinate to Italian Troops</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that when the Japanese side received reporters yesterday, the Naval Spokesperson stated that the Japanese Marine Corps had agreed with the Italian troops stationed in Shanghai to send some soldiers to the western suburbs of Shanghai and be subordinate to the Italian troops. This action was taken because a shooting incident occurred in that area yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Criticize Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd. According to local sources, the Japanese House of Peers is scheduled to meet today, at which time the Japanese government will be questioned about the assassination incidents in Shanghai. Japanese newspapers are extremely shocked by this terrorist activity, and they are allowing their anger to be directed at the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, saying that it has failed to make every effort to maintain order.</p>
<p>Kanazawa's Speech Makes Wild Speculations</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd. Vice Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy Ministry, made a speech this morning, declaring that the main purpose of anti-Japanese terrorists in Shanghai is to destroy China's peace movement. The second purpose is to use the terrorist means of threatening pro-Japanese elements to promote the close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The third purpose is to cause trouble for Britain and other countries. Kanazawa then went on to slander the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, saying that the Municipal Council's consistent treatment of terrorist activities as ordinary crimes in the media makes it difficult for the Japanese Navy Ministry to believe that it has the sincerity to thoroughly investigate the terrorists.</p>
<p>London Comments Express Extreme Disgust</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, London, 23rd. Regarding the Japanese authorities' desire to seize control of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, political figures in London have expressed extreme disgust, emphasizing that Britain will never compromise on this matter and hopes that other relevant countries will also take the same firm stance. The Japanese demands on the Municipal Council are being made under the pretext of recent assassination cases.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, London, 23rd. Both "The Times" and "The Daily News" published editorials today commenting on the Japanese air force bombing of Hong Kong territory. "The Times" emphasized that the bombing of Hong Kong by Japanese planes the day before yesterday clearly showed Japan's dissatisfaction with Britain's Far East policy and was "giving them a lesson." As for Japan's request to expand Japanese power in the Public Concession, "The Times" pointed out that the Japanese themselves have organized terrorist groups in the Public Concession, and if the Municipal Council were governed by the Japanese, it would fall into chaos within a week. "The Daily News" emphasized that the Hong Kong incident could not be explained away as a mistake by the Japanese air force. As for the Shanghai issue, the newspaper criticized the Japanese authorities for not cooperating with the Public Concession Municipal Council to crack down on suspects in the western suburbs of Shanghai and declared that Britain was not prepared to give up the few remaining rights it had in the Public Concession.</p>

<p>Since the fall of Greater Shanghai, in order to avoid the occurrence of unexpected events, the police authorities of the French Concession have closed off all the doors and alleys connecting to the Chinese areas. At the same time, they ordered all residents to nail barbed wire to the windows facing south to prevent terrorist incidents from occurring. Recently, due to frequent assassinations and other cases in the city, the French Concession authorities specially dispatched detectives to inspect each area yesterday. Those who found broken barbed wire fences were ordered to replace them to ensure safety.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Shanghai Stock Exchanges, It is Still Difficult to Resume Operations, The Regulations Issued by the Ministry of Finance Are Not Without Obstacles, Each Exchange Submitted a Reply After Careful Study <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the "August 13th" war and the withdrawal of the national army that defended Shanghai, the stock, gold, cotton cloth, flour, grain, and other exchanges in the city have been completely shut down due to the harsh environment, although underground trading among colleagues is still going on.</p>
<p>Completely Stalled</p>
<p>For more than a year now, there have been several rumors that the puppet "Reformed Government" coveted the various exchanges and would win over good people to attempt to restore them and seize control by formulating various fake regulations by the pseudo "Ministry of Industry". Fortunately, each exchange calmly responded and was not intimidated or lured by the Japanese puppets, and did not enter their shell. This allowed them to escape danger in stormy waves. Although the superficial situation of each exchange has temporarily become quiet, the Japanese puppets' conspiracy is still in full swing and they will not be satisfied until they get their way. Therefore, the central Ministries of Finance and Economy are very concerned about the current situation of the various exchanges in Shanghai and separately ordered the Exchange Supervision Committee, the Council of Directors of each exchange, and the Brokers Association to</p>
<p>Discuss Resumption of Operations</p>
<p>in order to prevent illegal acts by traitors and to maintain legitimate trading on the exchange, to eliminate past monopolies and manipulations, and to prevent Japanese puppets from borrowing names and mixing up the chaotic market. Three supplementary regulations were stipulated: (1) The market price of various public bonds, unified A, B, and C securities with a face value of one hundred yuan, should not be lower than seventy yuan when the stock market opens; (2) Non-industry buyers or non-brokers may not participate in the transaction; (3) Stipulate the standard market price and grade of Chinese yarn. After the Council of Directors of each exchange and the Brokers Association held several meetings separately, each exchange made careful comprehensive discussions. They all believed that (1) the stock market price depends entirely on domestic and international situations and should not be restricted. At present, if the unified public bond market price is low, it will inevitably skyrocket when the situation improves; (2) Restricting non-industry buyers or non-brokers from trading is also not stipulated in the</p>
<p>Trading Markets</p>
<p>of European and American countries. Moreover, the history of our country's trading market is short. If we only rely on transactions between colleagues, why bother with market trading and simply negotiate prices directly; (3) It is even more difficult to stipulate standard Chinese yarn market prices, grades,, etc. In the current harsh environment, if Chinese yarn is used as the standard alone, Japanese merchants will inevitably use illegal pressure to arbitrarily disrupt the market. Moreover, since the war, some Chinese yarn mills have been destroyed, and large-scale factories have fallen under the sphere of influence of the Japanese side and are difficult to restore. Even yarn mills that have not suffered war damage and direct trampling are pressured by the low-priced competition of Japanese yarn and thread, and their output is limited, and the market prices also differ greatly. If the yarn exchange resumes operations, it will only increase the opportunity for Japanese merchants to speculate and manipulate. Then, the Chinese yarn trade will suffer instead. Therefore, each exchange will report the real situation</p>
<p>Jointly to the Central Government</p>
<p>and painfully state the advantages and disadvantages, and ask the Ministries of Finance and Economy to re-draft the regulations in order to follow them. The reporter from the Modern Society inquired from relevant parties yesterday that after the central government's clear order on the resumption of operations of the various Shanghai exchanges arrived in Shanghai in November last year, each exchange individually studied the situation of each exchange and asked experts and experienced colleagues for detailed research. Therefore, it took a long time before they telegraphed the central government for approval recently. However, the purpose of each exchange is to maintain its own business in the special environment on the one hand, and to take into account national laws and sovereignty on the other hand, and not to rashly implement it. If unexpected events occur in the future, causing future troubles, all the people do not want it from the perspective of national standpoint. It is better to temporarily suspend business than to be seized by others, which is more appropriate.</p>

<p>After Japanese warships attempted to land at Haimen in eastern Zhejiang but were severely attacked by the defending Chinese army, they have already sailed away from the blockade line, and yesterday there were no unusual movements. The garrison troops arrested an arsonist traitor who communicated with the enemy on the 20th and executed him on the spot. Five Japanese planes flew to Ningbo the day before yesterday and dropped three bombs in Zhenhai, but there were no losses. A Japanese warship is currently docked in the waterway of Daotou in Dinghai, but there are also no unusual movements. The details of each situation are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Japanese Warships in Haimen No Longer Act Recklessly</p>
<p>The number of Japanese warships stationed in eastern Zhejiang suddenly increased to eight on the 18th. Four of them sailed into the blockade line and fired on the shore. The defending army bravely fought back and inflicted heavy damage. The Japanese army's attempt to land was thus unsuccessful. Around the morning of the 21st, two Japanese warships acted recklessly again, but were repelled by the defending army. One of them was even hit and injured. Afterwards, the Japanese warships did not dare to take any further action. Yesterday, reporters from the Xiandai News Agency inquired from the shipping industry and, as of 6:00 PM, had not heard of any action by the Japanese warships, so the situation there was quite calm.</p>
<p>Arsonist Traitor Executed</p>
<p>According to a report from a special correspondent of the Xiandai News Agency stationed in Ningbo, when the Japanese warships bombarded Haimen on the 18th, they had colluded with local bandits beforehand. Therefore, when the two sides were engaged in artillery battles, some traitorous bandits took the opportunity to set fires along the north bank of the river to echo the Japanese army's landing attempt. Fortunately, the local garrison troops discovered this and immediately dispatched troops to encircle and suppress them. The traitorous bandits' conspiracy ultimately failed. The large fire along the north bank of the river has now been extinguished. It is estimated that more than a hundred civilian houses were burned down, but the losses were relatively light. On the 20th, the garrison troops arrested an arsonist traitor who communicated with the enemy. After interrogation and trial, the traitor was executed on the spot, and the people were greatly pleased.</p>
<p>Five Japanese Planes Bomb Ningbo</p>
<p>According to the crew members of the Moufulun ship, who arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning, Ningbo was not affected in any way after the Japanese warships stationed in Haimen acted recklessly. The people were also very stable. Around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 21st), an air raid alert was suddenly issued in the Ning River. After a while, five Japanese planes were spotted circling and scouting over the city for a week. They then flew to Zhenhai and dropped three bombs on Zhaomai Mountain. One fell into the center of the river, and the other two fell in vacant and barren areas, so the Chinese side suffered no losses. Ningbo remains as peaceful as ever. It is heard that the Japanese planes then flew to Linhai and dropped eleven bombs, but the damage is unknown. A Japanese warship was spotted in the waterway of Daotou in Dinghai again starting on the 21st.</p>

<p>Since receiving orders to handle certification for transporting goods from Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to the Shanghai International Settlement, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce immediately drafted a certificate template and implemented it immediately. Merchants and residents of the settlement all found it convenient. The texts of the telegrams sent by the chamber to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, as well as the circulars sent to various customs offices and chambers of commerce, are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegrams to the Two Ministries</p>
<p>Chongqing Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Greetings. On February 13th, we received a real telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that before the examination and approval methods for transporting bamboo, wood, paper, eggs, firewood, charcoal, and cotton from the three provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to Shanghai are finalized, the affiliated chamber or the chamber of commerce at the place of shipment should issue a certificate. The freight merchant should submit the certificate to the customs for verification and release, etc. We have already invited various related trade associations and ordered that all member stores of the associations who transport goods from the above-mentioned provinces should have the association thoroughly verify that the goods are for their own use and issue a reliable guarantee. After the affiliated chamber verifies that the guarantee is consistent, it will issue a certificate and hand it to the freight merchant to submit to the customs for verification and release. At the same time, a copy of the notification letter will be prepared and sent to the chamber of commerce at the place of shipment for mutual verification. Two copies of the certificate template are attached for your review and approval, which is most convenient for the public. Furthermore, for the goods transported to Shanghai with certificates issued by the chamber of commerce at the place of shipment, please also have your ministry instruct them to notify the affiliated chamber in each case after issuing the certificate, so as to facilitate mutual assistance and avoid the risk of estrangement. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully, Xiao.</p>
<p>Circulars to Various Places</p>
<p>In addition to the telegrams to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also sent the certificate template to the Zhejiang Customs Superintendent, the Ouhai Customs Superintendent, the Fujian Customs Superintendent, and the chambers of commerce of Ningbo, Yongjia, Nanchang, Minhou, and Haimen, etc., for reference and record, and explained that when the certificates are issued, a notification letter will be prepared separately and submitted to the local chamber of commerce for contact. For all goods transported to Shanghai with certificates issued directly by the chamber of commerce at the place of shipment, please also notify the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Procurement by Various Industries</p>
<p>Since the customs offices in Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places were ordered to release local goods such as bamboo, wood, paper, cotton, and eggs for transport to Shanghai, industries such as fresh eggs, yarn factories, lumber, bamboo, and local paper have requested their respective trade associations to ask the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to issue certificates for procuring goods from Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places. They are loaded onto foreign ships from ports such as Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xinghua, and Quanzhou and transported to Shanghai. As a result, foreign shipping companies have increased the number of ships operating on the above-mentioned routes to carry local goods to Shanghai. The local goods previously accumulated in various ports have all been verified and released by the customs based on the certificates.</p>

<p>Around 9:00 PM yesterday, the Old Zha Police Station of the Public Concession received a report claiming that bandits were hiding near Nanjing Road on Zhejiang Road. Upon receiving the news, the police station immediately ordered the entire reserve team, along with detectives, to go to the area to search. At the same time, because the area was within the British garrison's defense zone, the British military commander was notified and dozens of British soldiers were dispatched to guard the area. At the time, guards were first stationed in the area between Zhejiang Road, Ningbo Road, Guangxi Road, and Nanjing Road, and the search began. It is estimated that the search started around 10:00 PM and ended at 11:30 PM. It is reported that three young students in a certain room of a major hotel were arrested on suspicion and taken to the police station, where they are still being interrogated. Nothing else was found, and the guards were immediately withdrawn. The situation then turned from tense to calm.</p>

It is decided that it will resume business immediately after the reorganization is successful. There are no new remittance shops, and there are two new money exchange shops, Zhenyuan and Wanmao.</p>
<p>Meeting Held to Discuss Still Using Public Vouchers</p>
<p>The money market reopened yesterday, and the discount rate was one dime. The market committee announced that "starting from February 23, transactions will still use public vouchers." The Money Industry Association will hold an executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM on the 25th to report on the resumption of business by the member shops and to change representatives and reorganize. The annual meeting of the South City Inner Garden on March 3 will be cancelled because the garden is located in the South City. The annual meeting of the North City Guild Hall on March 9 will be held as scheduled. In addition to the public sacrifice to the former directors, the business policies after the resumption of business will also be discussed. The Money Exchange Industry Association will hold an executive committee meeting and a dinner for the managers of the shops. The date and location will be decided by the committee members, probably during the Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>Market Stabilizes, Various Industries Resume Business</p>
<p>Markets for cotton cloth, yarn, groceries, sugar, antiques, securities, and other industries have all resumed trading yesterday. However, the soybean and rice market is scheduled to resume business today. The banking industry resumed business yesterday after the holidays. After the final accounting, various factories, firms, and companies have made profits due to the abnormal development within the settlement, and the national goods business of textiles, cotton cloth, daily necessities, etc. is the best. As for Shanghai's financial market, it remains as stable as ever. The various interest rates and market prices in the money and banking industry are the same as before the final accounting and have not changed. The two remittance shops that voluntarily closed down did so because the shareholders had no intention of continuing business and not because they were unable to maintain their operations, so it has nothing to do with the overall financial situation.</p>
<p>Operating Conditions of Money and Money Exchange Shops</p>
<p>Regarding the operating conditions of the shops last year, each shop reported to the trade association on the day it resumed business in the past. However, because it was a very unusual period last year, all reports were suspended. However, according to the Xinsheng News Agency's investigation, each shop made a profit last year, ranging from 5,000 to 100,000 yuan. However, because the shops suffered heavy losses in 1937, they all used last year's profits to offset the losses of the previous year, so each shop announced that business was average. As for the money exchange industry, business was very developed because people generally rushed to buy and collect foreign currency after the war. At the same time, the operation of remittance discounts and bond discounting was very profitable. More than 20 new money exchange shops were established last year. The out-of-bounds actions that harassed the people have completely disappeared, so the military and the people are in perfect harmony, and the local situation is exceptionally stable. Training is being stepped up to wait for the opportunity to counterattack in the hope of recovering the lost land as soon as possible. According to the visitor, the more than 200 Japanese soldiers stationed in the Haitou Dasheng Three Factories and Qinglong Port are all naval marines. Because they have not been paid for a long time, the soldiers are dressed unevenly and look haggard. They take the opportunity to scatter to various villages in groups of three or five to demand property, cigarettes, chickens, pigs, and other items from the farmers. There are often cases of young girls being robbed and gang-raped, and the people fear them like snakes and scorpions. Furthermore, three Japanese officers stationed in the Three Factories committed suicide by hanging themselves in the material room on the second floor of the factory the day before yesterday (the 21st) at night. According to the workers who stayed in the factory, when the captain of the team discovered this, he found two suicide notes in the pockets of the bodies, which belonged to war-weary suicides. However, the Japanese side strictly maintained secrecy and absolutely prohibited dissemination to avoid shaking the morale of the army. Furthermore, more than 50 puppet troops from Northeast China stationed in Qinglong Port defected to the Chinese army because they could not stand the oppression of the Japanese army.</p>

If necessary, each team may request the chief of the team to submit a report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval to appoint several assistant staff.</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Japanese Side Actually Notifies Consulates of Various Countries to Interfere with Foreign Ships Carrying Grain Based on the Puppet Government's Ban, Attempting to Cut Off Grain Transport to South China <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>After Japanese and North China merchants directly purchase rice and grain from the producing areas, the Shantou and Quanzhou gangs also purchase from the producing areas and transport it to various places to supply food to the people. Recently, the Japanese Consul General Miura actually notified the consuls of various countries that all third-country ships carrying rice and grain must be approved and issued permits. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese Side Interferes with Foreign Ships Loading Rice</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, has now notified the consuls of various countries, including Britain and Portugal, that all third-country ships loading rice and grain from Changyinsha, Hupukou, and other places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River must be approved and issued permits. It is heard that this is based on the ban of the puppet "Vichy Government" and that British ships Suzhou, Datong, Lisheng, Tonghe, and Norwegian ship Dabe violated the ban by loading rice and grain.</p>
<p>Shanghai Market Attaches Importance to Japanese Merchants Handling Rice</p>
<p>In order to maintain the food supply for the Shanghai people, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association is making every effort to dredge the source and stabilize rice prices. At present, Shanghai has about 700,000 bags of rice in stock, which is enough to maintain the supply for several months. Therefore, there is no shortage of food for the Shanghai people for the time being. The Japanese side's interference with foreign ships carrying rice and grain this time is aimed at not allowing foreign ships to carry rice and grain to Shantou, Quanzhou, eastern Zhejiang, and other places in South China. As for Japanese ships carrying rice to various places in North China, they are not prevented at all. Rice merchants in Shanghai attach great importance to the transport of rice by Japanese and North China merchants to North China.</p>
<p>Japanese Opinions Reported by Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The Zi Lin News reports that the Japanese naval spokesperson told reporters yesterday (the 22nd) that the Japanese side prohibits the transport of rice and other items within its controlled areas to areas not controlled by the Japanese army. However, two British ships registered in Shanghai loaded rice in Hupukou, a port controlled by the Japanese side, and transferred it to other British and Norwegian ships, which transported it to Chinese-controlled areas. The Japanese naval authorities have instructed the consular authorities to issue a protest to make the British and Norwegian consular authorities aware of this matter and have notified other countries that the "Vichy Government" has banned the export of rice and other items due to the Japanese military authorities' need for them. The Japanese naval investigation revealed that the British ships Datong and Tonghe (both transliterations) loaded rice in that area after negotiating with the Japanese army and the Hupukou "Maintenance Association" on the 11th of this month. The rice was then transferred to the British ship Suzhou and the Norwegian ship Dabe (transliteration). The Suzhou sailed to Shantou with rice at 7:30 AM on the 12th of this month, and the Dabe also sailed to an unknown destination at 7:45 AM that morning. In addition, the British ship Lisheng (transliteration) also sailed to an unknown destination with rice at 8:00 AM. Because this kind of activity hinders the Japanese army's military operations, it is requested that measures be taken to prohibit third-country ships from engaging in this kind of activity in the future. The spokesperson did not say that the Japanese authorities reserved the right to continue to file written protests and take appropriate measures to prevent such activities.</p>

<p>Xu Shuhuan and his brother, who are from Shaoxing, live together at No. 26 Beigaoshou Lane, Aierjin Road, and rent part of the remaining rooms to Xu Zhenping. Shuming's brother-in-law opened a melon seed company at No. 174 Guangxi Road. The staff and workers of the store also live in Xu's house. After dinner the day before yesterday (the 22nd), Shuming saw that the guests and friends were all gathered, so he went to the parlor.</p>
<p>Gambling on Pai Gow</p>
<p>Shouting and drinking, it was extremely lively. Suddenly, someone secretly reported to the relevant Huisi Police Station by telephone, falsely claiming that Xu's house had been robbed. The head of the police immediately sent armed Chinese and foreign detectives in a car to surround and arrest them. When they pushed open the gate and entered, the gamblers fled through the side door of the kitchen. Zhao Xiaomao, one of the gamblers, put his hands in his clothes when he fled. The Western police did not hold Lai's</p>

<p>Tu Changxing, a native of Ningbo, is 26 years old and lives at No. 23 Rongsheng Lane, North Jiangxi Road. He was introduced by Zhang Yuanda, the owner of Dingyuan Money Shop at No. 243 Sichuan Road, to work as a silver money accountant in the Tanaka Shop established by the Japanese Tanaka at No. 1157 North Sichuan Road. However, Tu, who likes gambling, usually enters and exits the Hollywood gambling den on Yu Garden Road in western Shanghai.</p>
<p>Every gamble will be defeated</p>
<p>As a result, he has embezzled account funds of up to 1,151 yuan. Recently, the Japanese Tanaka discovered this and questioned Tu. Tu also admitted to using the account funds privately, but was willing to find a way to return them within the past years. By New Year's Eve, Tu had indeed returned 751 yuan in legal currency first, and the remaining 400 yuan would be raised again. Tanaka expressed satisfaction and did not delve into it. Unexpectedly, Tu Changxing's behavior was actually</p>

<p>The Shanghai West Opium Market, which is under the protection of special forces, must transport opium in small amounts when it is imported into the settlement. If it is seized, the loss is minimal. Therefore, this type of case almost happens every day, and on the eve of the Lunar New Year, a soil bank also used this transportation method to divide 408 taels of opium into 34 packages, all wrapped in red paper, and wrapped in a large package with newspaper. A native of Anhui, Wang Xiaowuzi, and a native of Jiangbei, Xu Chengyuan, jointly took the goods to the Xinkang Lane on Jisi Fei Road to hand over. Wang and others took it to near Xinkang Lane on Kangnaot Road, where they were caught by the search team of the Gedeng Road Police Station, taken to the police station, and detained until yesterday morning. He was escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Huang interrogated him. The two defendants both confessed that the opium was hired by Wang A'er to be sent to Xinkang Lane, and they were promised a delivery fee of two yuan. Then, the police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin claimed that according to Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Prohibition of Opium, those who transport more than 500 taels of soil will be sentenced to death. Now, the soil assisted by the defendant has more than 400 taels. The circumstances are serious, and he should be severely punished. At the end of the debate by the lawyer designated by the court to defend the defendant, Judge Huang, considering that the two defendants were fooled by others, leniently treated them and sentenced them to five years imprisonment each, and each deprived of public rights for five years, and the opium was confiscated. There was also Xu Yongxing, a native of Jiangbei, who bought 19 taels of opium from the Caojiadu Soil Bank the day before yesterday and made it into three packages, intending to take it back to Jiangbei for sale. When he passed Xiaoshadu Road, he was also searched by the patrol team, taken to the police station, and escorted to the First Special Court yesterday morning. After interrogation by Judge Huang, it was confirmed that Xu was sentenced to two months imprisonment. If the fine is commuted, it will be allowed to offset one day with two yuan, and the opium will be confiscated.</p>

<p>Li Wenjian, a Chinese detective of the Chengdu Road Police Station, learned the night before that there were suspicious signs of a gang of thieves inside house number 3524, Yinhua Lane, Roberts Road, West Shanghai. He went there with detectives Wu Junqing, Zhou Yushan, Zhang Changhong, and Wang Dianchen. They arrested Li Jiaguang, a thief from Jiangbei. They then went to No. 208 Changping Road and arrested Zhao Maifu, a man from Changzhou. They also arrested Shen Yanwu, a man from Jiangbei, at No. 22 Guangxing Lane, Peng Road. They were brought back to the police station. Under questioning, they confessed that they had accomplices and weapons in a bungalow behind the Jisi Feier Road Garden. Chinese and foreign detectives, fully armed, rode in an armored vehicle back to the address to make arrests, but the place was already empty. After searching, they found nothing. The detectives planned to search Li Jiaguang's home again. Unexpectedly, as the vehicle passed near Wujiaochang in Caojiadu, someone suddenly opened fire on the armored vehicle, with dozens of shots fired. Detective Liu Changhong tried to get out of the vehicle to make arrests, but he was shot in a vital area and died instantly. The perpetrators escaped in the chaos. The body was carried to the coroner's office. Yesterday morning, Li Jiaguang and the other two men were escorted to the Special No. 1 Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested detention, which the court approved. The next hearing was scheduled for March 4. The coroner also examined Liu's body and ordered it to be placed in a coffin. It was reported that the police department would provide generous compensation to Detective Liu's family and would rigorously pursue the perpetrators and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that Chinese detective Liu Changhong of the Chengdu Road Police Station in the Public Concession died on the 21st after being shot when the armored vehicle he was riding in was attacked in Wujiaochang, West Shanghai, while apprehending thieves. It has now been discovered that one of the three thieves, male and female, arrested in connection with the case, named Zhao Guangfu, was the ringleader who assassinated Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World, at the entrance of the Great World several years ago. He was later sentenced to twelve years in prison by the Special No. 2 Court and transferred to the Caohejing Prison. During the Shanghai war last year, he was transferred to the rear to serve. It is unknown how he returned to Shanghai and resumed his life of crime. Chinese detective Liu Changhong of the Chengdu Road Police Station in the Public Concession was ordered on the 22nd to travel by armored vehicle to Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, to search for gang members. En route, near the Olympic Theatre, the armored vehicle was indiscriminately fired upon, resulting in Liu's death in the hail of bullets while on duty. His body was moved to the Central Funeral Home on Mabai Road. The funeral is scheduled for 10:00 AM this morning, with the burial at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. The Chinese inspector and detectives of the Chengdu Road Police Station are deeply saddened by Liu's death, as he was loyal to his duty and died tragically. They will all attend the funeral. Liu's family is quite poor, and it is said that the police department will provide generous compensation.</p>

On the afternoon of the 22nd, at around 4:00 PM, she was wearing a maroon velvet coat, with her hair permed and wearing leather shoes, looking like a wealthy woman. However, she is an immoral woman who conspired with four accomplices (who are now at large) to set up an open-air poker gambling stall in front of No. 238 Mintiniyin Road to entice passersby to gamble and swindle them out of their money. A local woman named Chuan Ge, residing at No. 14 Ningfu Lane, Glock Road, Pi Shao Nai Road, was walking past the gambling stall set up by Luo Wu and others, carrying a wad of banknotes. Wu noticed this and used her seductive skills to lure Ge into the game. Before long, Wu's accomplices snatched all 75 yuan in banknotes that Ge was holding and fled. Ge shouted loudly for robbers, and a French Concession detective happened to be patrolling nearby. He arrested Luo Wu and brought her to the police station. Yesterday, she was sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court. The lawyer for the French Concession Administration, Chen Ming, presented the case, requesting an extension to arrest the escaped accomplices and investigate before prosecuting. Next, the plaintiff, Chuan Ge, described how the defendant had lured her into gambling and robbed her. Under questioning, Luo Wu claimed that the woman was simply passing by and that there was no luring into gambling. Her other statements were evasive.

<p>Butterfield &amp; Swire Shipping Company, a British firm, is the largest shipping agency in China. It owns more than 60 vessels, large and small, operating on the Yangtze River, Xiang River, Sichuan River, and the coastal ports of North and South China, covering all ports in the country. Yang Meinan, the Chinese General Manager, has served the company for more than 50 years, starting as a trainee. His son, Shaonan, is handsome and capable, and serves as the Chinese Shipping Manager in the same company. Therefore, the Yang family has a long history with Butterfield &amp; Swire. The Westerners in the company have always held Yang in high regard, and the London head office has also been very respectful of him. Yang is amiable and approachable in his daily dealings, and is admired by various Hakka associations, colleagues, and employees. Yang is now 68 years old. He first tendered his resignation two years ago, but the London head office persuaded him to stay. Last spring, he resigned a second time, saying that he was old and frail and feared that he would neglect his duties. The company was unable to retain him and telegraphed the head office, which only approved his resignation at the board meeting last winter, effective March of this year. Upon learning of this, colleagues and Hakka associations prepared a public banquet to bid him farewell. It is scheduled to be held tomorrow (the 25th) at the East Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road. It is said that the company's managers, Western staff of all levels, and all Chinese employees and Hakka associations will participate, and there will be a grand occasion. Here is a brief introduction to Yang Meinan and his history with Butterfield &amp; Swire. Yang Meinan, a native of Guangdong, is now 68 years old. He joined Butterfield &amp; Swire in the Dinghai year (1887) as a trainee. Two years later, he was transferred to Ningbo to manage export cargo. In the Ren Chen year (1892), he was appointed comprador for the Wuchang ships. In the autumn of the Gui Si year (1893), he was promoted to Chinese Manager of Yantai, where he served for 20 years. He made great efforts to develop shipping in Dalian, Yingkou, Andong, Dadonggou, Dengzhou, Longkou, Yangjiaogou, and Vladivostok, achieving remarkable results. In the Jiawu year (1894), the Yantai Huijian Bank, impressed by his reputation, hired him as the concurrently serving Chinese Manager. In 1919, he was transferred to Shanghai to serve as the Chinese Shipping Manager of the Shanghai head office. In 1926, he was dispatched to Wuhan to reorganize the Hankou branch. After completing the task, he returned to Shanghai and was promoted to Chinese General Manager in the autumn of 1933. His son, Shaonan, was promoted to Chinese Shipping Manager at the same time. Since Yang was promoted to General Manager, he has been praised by both the company and the Hakka community. In addition to the joint public banquet by Chinese and Western employees and Hakka associations, a plaque inscribed by a famous person will be presented to him as a souvenir. It is said that the London head office and the Shanghai head office managers will also present souvenirs, and branch offices in Hong Kong and other ports have sent telegrams of congratulations.</p>

<p>Last April, the Shanghai Power Company proposed to the Shanghai Municipal Council Ratepayers' Annual Meeting to increase electricity rates by 32.5%.

It was then decided on a compromise solution to allow a discretionary increase of 2.25% in electricity rates. The remaining 10% would be jointly reviewed by the Municipal Council Finance Committee and the Power Company, and a final decision would be made six months later. Now that the six-month period has expired, the Municipal Council Finance Committee has agreed to the Power Company's request to increase the remaining 10% of electricity rates.

<h3 id="e109">Five Dietary Therapies for Cough: Various Beneficial and Harmless Foods to Aid Healing <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>Coughing has different causes, distinguishing between external influences and internal injuries. The symptoms are complex, and medication often requires more than one or two doses for recovery. However, treating coughs with dietary therapy is often more effective. For example: (1) For wind-heat coughs, use one ounce of fresh radish, two loquat leaves (remove hair), one foot of fresh reed root (remove nodes), and the peel of one snow pear. Decoction this in water to serve as tea. Adding a small amount of rock sugar will make it more palatable. Cooked radishes can also be eaten as a snack to relieve hunger. (2) For coughs due to deficient heat, use a high-quality snow pear, cut off the top, remove the core, add a small amount of rock sugar, steam it in a rice cooker until heated, and eat the juice and flesh. This is also quite effective. (3) For those with coughs with a lot of phlegm, sweet almonds can be boiled into a milk soup, sweetened with sugar, and consumed. The taste is exceptionally delicious. (4) For those with coughs where phlegm and heat are congealed and difficult to resolve, use salt-cured jellyfish, rinsed to reduce saltiness, and fresh water chestnuts (peeled). Boil and drink the juice, and eat the water chestnuts. This is also effective. (Wang Mengying refers to this as Snow Broth Soup.) (5) For consumptive coughs due to pulmonary tuberculosis, use lily bulbs and sweet almonds to make porridge. Alternatively, use pork lung and skin soup as part of the meal. If there is bone-steaming fever (internal heat), use Cordyceps sinensis to stew duck, which can also replenish deficiencies. There are many such examples. Observing the presenting symptoms to determine the appropriate food can often lead to quicker and more effective results than medication. One should also list foods to avoid in detail, such as spicy and roasted foods, seafood, and foods that trigger illness. All of these must be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Way of Cooking <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Shen'an</p>
<p>The art of cooking can be broadly divided into five categories: steaming, boiling, frying, stir-frying, and smoking. Other methods such as pickling, saucing, roasting, stinking/fermenting, and braising are nothing more than attempts to be innovative and claim novelty.</p>
<p>Among the five cooking methods, steaming is the most consistent with the principles of healthy living. Fried and stir-fried foods often involve burning the oil in the pan due to excessive heat. The deliciousness may lie in this, but so does the fire-toxicity. Healthy people should not eat too much of it, and sick people should avoid it even more, especially those suffering from external diseases and ulcers. Smoked foods are often homemade to enhance meals in most households. However, after prolonged smoking, the food already contains hidden fire-toxicity. Occasional consumption is acceptable, but eating too much is not suitable for the throat, intestines, and stomach. Roasted foods have even more direct contact with flames, and the fire-toxicity is even greater, with the same harmful effects as smoked foods. Pickled, sauced, and braised foods are mostly preserved foods. Those that have not yet decayed are acceptable occasionally. Eating stinking/fermented foods is a unique preference of the people of Zhejiang and Shaoxing. Although they are also considered delicious, they directly harm the throat, and those with weak spleens and stomachs should avoid them. Boiled foods, where water and ingredients are cooked simultaneously, are quite suitable for daily consumption in households. After an illness, this is also good for nutrition. However, steamed foods are the most beneficial for human physiology because they are steamed in a rice cooker with rice, absorbing the essence of the rice and avoiding the harmful effects of fire-toxicity from other methods. It is especially suitable for children to enhance their meals. This is the best way to maintain health through diet.</p>
<p>In short, the freshness of all foods is the first essential. Green vegetables are the most beneficial. Villagers often live long lives, partly due to the excellent air quality and partly due to the nutrition from fresh vegetables, without the fire-toxicity of fried and stir-fried foods harming their bodies. Tofu is also a good food for health. Dr. Wu Tingfang, throughout his life, used tofu as his only side dish in daily meals and enjoyed an exceptionally long life. Therefore, although there are many clever cooking methods, it is best to cook natural foods simply.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Homemade Lotus Root Flour <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xiangyun</p>
<p>Lotus roots are produced in ponds or paddy fields, with the most production in summer. They are usually regarded as unexceptional, but they have great nutritional benefits for the human body! Because lotus root contains a component that is rich in contracting blood vessels, it can also remove blood stasis, generate new blood, and resolve heat toxins. People who suffer from hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and anemia can definitely benefit greatly if they eat it regularly.</p>
<p>However, fresh lotus roots are rare outside of summer. We can make them into lotus root flour for storage during the peak summer season for consumption throughout the year. Method: Wash the lotus root, place it in a sifting basket, and rub it constantly. Place a clay pot underneath to collect the juices. Then filter out the residue. Allow the remaining white slurry to precipitate and dry. This becomes lotus root flour. When eating, add white sugar and pour hot water over it. It has the functions of nourishing blood, promoting Qi, and harmonizing the stomach. It is especially suitable for patients. The filtered residue is also a good food. It can be made into dumplings with white sugar and fried in oil. They are sweet and delicious. Alternatively, it can be mixed with minced meat, salt, soy sauce, and other seasonings to make dumplings, fried until golden, and slightly seasoned to make a good side dish. There is not much authentic lotus root flour on the market, so I am introducing the method of making it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Discussing "Fat Replenishment" <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Minshu</p>
<p>Essence is the foundation of the body; therefore, it should be deeply stored and not leaked externally. Otherwise, it is easy to develop deficiency and consumptive diseases. Those with excessive essence depletion can use "Fat Replenishment" regularly to turn weakness into strength. Method: Use eight ounces of walnut kernels, finely grind without roasting; eight ounces of black sesame seeds, finely grind without roasting; two ounces of small black beans, roast and grind; two pounds of fresh pork lard, render to obtain pure fat. Add the walnuts, sesame seeds, and black beans into the rendered fat. Stir evenly with chopsticks. After it solidifies, move it to a quiet, shady place. This is "Fat Replenishment." Every morning, on an empty stomach, take one spoonful of "Fat Replenishment," place it in boiling water, add two or three eggs, and as much white granulated sugar as desired. Cook it together to replace breakfast. Take it daily, and the effect is enormous. All young people who indulge in excessive lust, have weak bodies, dizziness, tinnitus, and palpitations can be treated with it. Do not underestimate it as an ordinary food. (Note) For those with hemorrhoids, add four ounces of finely chopped persimmon cakes. For those who often have loose stools, lightly roast the black sesame seeds. For those with chest tightness and Qi stagnation, add two ounces of finely chopped kumquat cakes.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Women and Liver-Stomach Diseases <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Jinqiu</p>
<p>"Women prioritize the liver," I don't know who started this hackneyed phrase, and I don't have time to investigate its origins right now. However, it is true that women tend to be melancholy and hold unhappiness in their hearts.</p>
<p>What the Chinese call liver Qi, liver Yang, liver Fire, and liver Wind is a mistake to recognize as a substantial liver disease. Liver Qi, liver Yang, liver Fire, and liver Wind are only certain phenomena of the nervous system. The effect of medicine cannot exceed the spiritual comfort, so "It is easier to treat ten men than to cure one woman" is also true. The ancient sage Chen Xiuyuan said it most clearly: "Women's illnesses are not told to others, and they cannot express themselves like children, which makes them difficult to treat. Doctors also cannot ask about every detail, making it even more like groping in the dark. The most important thing is that it is close to emotional stagnation... Some have hot flashes, restlessness, feeling hungry like gnawing, and listlessness. This is caused by long-term opening of emotional apertures and internal burning of lust. As parents, observe their intentions, quickly choose a partner, and set a date to calm their minds." If doctors believe that the human body is a heartless, dead machine and that medicine is an absolute science, they will sometimes hit a wall and this road will not work. Traditional Chinese medicine does have unique secrets for treating liver Qi diseases; Jiawei Xiaoyao San (Augmented Rambling Powder) is indeed a miraculous medicine.</p>
<p>A certain phenomenon of liver Qi disease is so-called "visceral agitation." The Miscellaneous Diseases of Women chapter in the Golden Cabinet states: "Women with visceral agitation are prone to sadness and crying, acting as if possessed by spirits, and repeatedly yawning. Sweet Wheat and Jujube Decoction governs this. The medicinal ingredients are three taels of licorice root, one sheng (approximately 200ml) of wheat, and ten jujubes." Visceral disease belongs to the realm of the nervous system. Temporary mental disorder affects sensation, movement, and secretion. Younger women are more likely to be affected, and men sometimes have it as well. The patient's psychology may be ecstatic, terrified, fortunate, or admiring; sometimes, delirium and bizarre hallucinations appear, such as seeing strange phenomena, hearing voices, talking and laughing at empty air, etc. As for the cause, it is still uncertain, but it is quite reliable that it is related to temperament, thought, blood deficiency, and sexual desire. Liver Qi stagnation often leads to stomach problems. It is permissible that patients with liver Qi attacks are unwilling to eat more food, and the most common cause of stomach problems is that the stomach is empty and acid reflux occurs. Therefore, starving and not eating when liver Qi is attacking is most inappropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Black Sesame and Walnuts <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Xiwan</p>
<p>Every winter and spring, people in society compete to consume tonics such as ginseng, bird's nest, white fungus, and tortoise and deer gelatin, which are well-known to all. However, the properties, flavors, and functions of the above-mentioned varieties are all different. If the intake is inappropriate, not only will it be impossible to benefit, but it may even cause harm. Moreover, the selling price is too high, making it difficult to make it widespread. As the saying goes, "Medicinal tonics are not as good as food tonics." There are black sesame and walnuts, which people often do not pay much attention to and always regard as snacks. All candy stores use them to make various patterns for people to pass the time with. What they don't know is that these two are by no means insignificant in terms of our nutrition, and they are not only suitable for winter but also good to eat at all times. They are cheap and beautiful, making it especially convenient for ordinary people to purchase.</p>
<p>Black sesame seeds This substance is produced everywhere. Its nature is sweet and neutral. In terms of its effectiveness, it is not only as stated in the medical books that it "can nourish the liver and kidneys, nourish lung Qi, nourish blood, dispel wind, and moisten the five internal organs." Through repeated tests, it has special effects on nourishing the brain. Our country has always lacked products for nourishing the brain. Now that we have black sesame seeds, it can be said to be an effective product of Chinese medicine for nourishing the brain. Long-term consumption of this product will definitely bring many benefits. Although it is a small item, it should not be ignored; however, its nature is slightly slippery; those who often have loose stools and unstable essence should use it with discretion.</p>
<p>Walnuts Produced in the north, its nature is sweet, neutral and warm. It can nourish Qi, nourish blood, resolve phlegm, consolidate essence, sharpen hearing, and treat lower body deficiency and cold. It is most suitable for warming the lungs, nourishing the kidneys, and nourishing the brain. It is most suitable for symptoms such as cough, asthma, and soreness of the waist in the elderly. However, its nature is slightly warm. Those with phlegm-heat in the lungs, raging fire in the gate of life, and Yin deficiency with blood sputum should not eat too much.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Looking at Sick Foods <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— He Lisan</p>
<p>If you have close relatives and friends who are sick, you will inevitably go to visit and comfort them because you are concerned about them. This is also human nature. When visiting, it is common to bring some food as a gift to express goodwill; in reality, this is not necessary and may easily cause the patient to eat badly. Even after the patient has recovered, it is better to choose foods that are easy to digest and do not harm the body. Previously, I had a friend who suffered from damp-heat and took a month to recover. Suddenly, some relatives sent several items of food, including a braised pork knuckle. At the time, seeing it made his index finger move greatly, so he ate a big meal. Unexpectedly, the greasy food stagnated, causing a relapse and even costing him his life. Therefore, when sending food to patients, you must carefully select it. Otherwise, loving them will harm them.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Almond Cream Soup <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Weicang</p>
<p>Almonds have both sweet and bitter types, both of which are used medicinally, and sweet almonds can also be used as food seasoning, expanding its use. Sweet almonds are sweet almonds. The taste is sweet and the nature is warm and neutral. It has the function of moisturizing the lungs, stopping coughs, lowering Qi, and relieving asthma. It has a special effect on chronic coughs due to lung deficiency; making it into almond cream makes the taste even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Method for making cream: Use twenty to thirty sweet almonds, soak in water, peel off the skin and tips, mash them, add water, stir, and squeeze the juice. Add a little rock sugar or glucose to taste. Boil once or twice and you can drink it. The aroma is fragrant and plump, and the color is as pure as milk. It is a superlative product for all who have a long cough and internal injuries. It moistens dryness, clears and calms the lungs. However, it has the disadvantage of slightly smoothing the intestines; those with very loose stools should avoid it.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Organ Therapy Long Invented in China (2) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Yenong</p>
<p>Organ therapy for diseases is the newest method in modern medicine, which is to use the organs of animals to treat human diseases. According to Chinese medicine, this method was invented as early as hundreds of years ago. For example, medical books of past dynasties have recorded the functions of organs for treating diseases, which can be clearly traced. Unfortunately, later generations of doctors failed to study and promote it, causing such a good method to almost disappear without a trace. There were examples in the previous issue, and now I will continue to discuss it.</p>
<p>Sheep liver… As the saying goes, "Nourish the lungs with lungs and the liver with liver." This statement actually implicitly fits scientific principles. Using the same body tissue to nourish internal organs, its effect is far better than other drugs. Sheep liver can nourish the liver and mainly treats eye diseases. The eyes and liver are closely related, so drugs that nourish the liver always have the effect of improving eyesight. For example, internal eye obstruction, blurred vision, and blindness after illness are all caused by a lack of liver fluid, which affects the optic nerve and causes abnormalities. Therefore, it is advisable to eat more sheep liver to treat it. The method of cooking liver should not be too old. It is best to cook it until it is half-cooked and eaten. The taste should be slightly light and not salty. For red eyes in children, cut fresh sheep liver into thin slices, soak it in well water for five minutes, take it out, and apply it to the eyelids. It will heal after several times.</p>
<p>Pig lungs… Replenish the weakness of human lungs. People with weak lungs are prone to colds, often causing minor cold coughs with a lot of sputum, and are mentally fatigued. It is advisable to cook pig lungs and mussels together and eat them as a dish to accompany meals for a long time. When lung disease enters a serious stage, the sputum often contains blood or a large amount of hemoptysis. Use pig lungs cooked lightly and dip them in Baiji powder (sold in Chinese pharmacies) to eat. Baiji can also nourish the lungs and stop bleeding. Using the two together will achieve results quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e118">New Recipes for Health-Preserving Foods <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Ni Xihan</p>
<p>Human food, regardless of grains, water, fish, meat, or vegetables, has some parts that are beneficial to the body and some parts that are harmful to the body. What sets them apart from medicines is only the sweet and bitter taste and the slightly different effects. Now, I will collect several kinds of health-preserving foods for use in peacetime health preservation and post-illness conditioning. Is this not appropriate?</p>
<p>(1) Maltose Egg Paste (Preparation) Take an egg, remove the shell, and place it in a bowl. Add a spoonful of tender maltose syrup (commonly known as pure sugar, i.e., malt extract). Use an egg beater (sold in hardware stores) or bamboo chopsticks to stir it until it foams. If you like fragrance, add one or two drops of lemon juice. Then take an appropriate amount of boiling water and pour it in to form a paste, which is called maltose egg paste. (Effect) This paste is fragrant, sweet, and tastes smooth, and can nourish and moisturize the intestines and stomach. It is suitable for thin people to maintain health and for all post-illness conditioning.</p>
<p>(2) Hundred Fruit Soup (Preparation) Use true wild lily (very small in shape, slightly bitter in taste, hard in nature, produced in the coastal beaches of Chuansha and Putuo), white fruits (i.e., ginkgo), and cook them together. Add almond powder, rock sugar, and true honey as condiments. Cook until the white fruits are soft and rotten, and then eat them, including the soup. (Effect) Its taste is sweet, fragrant, and fresh, especially entering the lung meridian. It can nourish, moisturize, lower Qi and resolve phlegm, and raise fluids and nourish the stomach. It can treat deficiency, consumption, fire excess, dry cough, and insomnia, or post-lung disease conditioning, or reduced but not healed hemoptysis. Taking it daily will show miraculous effects.</p>
<p>(3) Black Sesame Crisp (Preparation) First, take Japonica rice, stir-fry until yellow, and grind it into a powder. Then, stir-fry black sesame seeds until cooked, crush lotus seeds, and mix them with the powder and grind again into a gray powder. Then add an appropriate amount of white sugar (it must be used raw and does not need to be diluted with water). At the same time, use lard to render the oil. Wait for it to cool and mix it in, but do not add water. The sweetness, saltiness, softness, and hardness all depend on the sugar and oil. Adjust it at will. When it reaches the appropriate degree, take a printing board (sold in floral shops) and press the powder into it to make it. However, storage must be done in ceramic containers, otherwise it will easily go oily. (Effect) This crisp does not harden after prolonged storage. It tastes crisp, sweet, fragrant, and plump. It is indeed very flavorful, can nourish the spleen and kidneys, can help with fat, has the function of moisturizing the intestines, and has no disadvantage of accumulation. It is suitable for those with Yin deficiency and middle deficiency, and has extremely nourishing power. It is even more suitable for those who suffer from dry intestines, difficulty with bowel movements, and have opium addiction or are thin.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Cash Price After the Holiday Reaches a New High: 2,102 Yuan <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Spring Festival holiday is over. Yesterday, the cash speculation market opened as usual. The market conditions were unpredictable, and the situation was very chaotic. Generally, it rose first and then fell, and then rose again. Initially, it was due to the remaining momentum from the end of the previous year, and gold shops absorbed a lot of power. In addition, silver shops bought more than they sold, making the circulating chips on the table even more exhausted. It broke through the two major hurdles of 90 yuan and 100 yuan in succession, and an unprecedented peak of 2,102 yuan appeared. Later, due to the swarm of sellers with price limits outside the 100-yuan mark, and most households were still flat due to opening foreign exchange, the intention to exit was strong. A certain money exchange industry sold off a large amount, and it immediately turned downward. Finally, the Hong Kong gang came to absorb purchases again, and Chongqing went upward. However, the result was a rise of eight yuan. People's hearts in all parties were firm, and transactions were quite active in the morning, but few were made in the afternoon, totaling 1,030 taels. Silver shop jewelry also increased by one yuan, creating an unprecedented peak. The customs gold and British pure gold, etc., were slightly lower than the Saturday before the Spring Festival holiday.</p>
<p>Speculation Market Rises Eight Yuan</p>
<p>In the morning, the initial selling price per bar (ten taels) was 2,090 yuan, but no transaction was seen. It was not until 9:45 that silver shops began to do 50 taels of mutual trading, and money exchanges entered the silver shops for 50 taels. Both were at 2,086 yuan as the opening price. Later, although foreign exchange was flat, the buying enthusiasm of gold shops was unstoppable. At that time, silver shops bought more than they sold, and the chips on the table were even more scarce. The gold price then soared upwards. Gold shops entered silver shops for 50 taels, and silver shops entered money exchanges for 50 taels at a price of 90 yuan. Gold shops entered money exchanges for 50 taels at a price of 92 yuan. Silver shops entered money exchanges for 50 taels at a price of 96 yuan. Later, gold shops also entered money exchanges for 50 taels at the same price. Silver shops entered money exchanges for 50 taels, and silver shops mutually did 50 taels, both at a price of 98 yuan. Silver shops entered money exchanges for 50 taels at a price of 100 yuan. Later, money exchanges mutually did 50 taels at a price of 102 yuan, which was an unprecedented peak. After this, due to the swarm of sellers with price limits outside the yen, the rise stopped and turned downward. Silver shops mutually did 50 taels at a price of 98 yuan. After this, a certain money exchange suddenly sold off a large amount on behalf of a wealthy local resident, vigorously selling more than 200 taels. From 98 yuan down to 90 yuan, all were taken in by the silver shops. Later, it was sold to the gold shop for 50 taels at a price of 90 yuan, and then sold to the same industry for 50 taels at a price of 86 yuan. Near noon, money exchanges mutually did 50 taels at 89 yuan as the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, due to the new Spring Festival, there were few members present, but the Hong Kong gang came to entrust a certain silver shop to absorb purchases again, causing it to rise again, entering the money exchange for 100 taels at a price of 93 yuan and 94 yuan. Those who offered were all exiting on behalf of wealthy residents. After this, although the Hong Kong gang still had the intention to enter, it was difficult to find sellers, so no transaction was made. Therefore, the closing price in the evening was still 2,094 yuan, which was 8 yuan higher than before the Spring Festival holiday (i.e., last Friday). The difference throughout the day was 16 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand of gold was 2,100 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,085 yuan. The current bid gold was hung 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, but no transaction was made.</p>
<p>Jewelry Suspended at 212 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of silver shop jewelry was not changed. It was not until 10:30 that, due to the surge in speculation, it broke through the 100-yuan mark, so it immediately increased by one yuan. Datong Heng Lao Qingyun and others changed the suspension to 212 yuan. New peers also changed the suspension to 210 yuan, and the purchase price was 204 yuan. The above listed prices all created unprecedented peaks.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Changed and Reduced by Half a Bents</p>
<p>London, 22nd, the price of British pure gold per ounce was reduced by half a Bents, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, and four Bents. The Chinese cash purchase price of the Central Bank also retreated to 1,210 yuan and nine jiao. The listed customs gold price was not changed, and it was still 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard bid gold price also fell by four jiao, totaling 1,206 yuan and two jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Foreign Exchange Trend is Quite Stable <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market's Spring Festival holiday is over. Chinese and foreign banks have started operating. Although foreign firms came to bargain yesterday, the foreign banks' supply intention was quite good, and the yarn and flower gang also had some sales, so the situation did not change much. Therefore, the transaction was also quite silent. The Hong Kong exchange rate initially tended to loosen due to the foreign banks' poor digestion, but the money exchanges' supply intention turned lighter, so it gradually returned to flat.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London big bar shrank by 125 recently compared to before the Spring Festival holiday (i.e., last Saturday), and the forward was unchanged. The New York silver price also did not rise or fall. The price of gold in London fell by half a Bents. The exchange rate of British against American was higher by one li and three points, against French was higher by one centime, and against Shanghai was flat. The exchange rate of American against British shrank by 0.0625, against French fell by 0.0625, and against Shanghai was unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates were fixed as before. The banks' opening selling prices in the morning were eight Bents, one two five for British exchange and fifteen yuan, eight seven five for American exchange, with no honor or disgrace compared to before the Spring Festival holiday (last Saturday). After the opening, although foreign firms were bargaining, HSBC and various foreign banks supplied as much as possible, so the situation did not change much. Foreign firms absorbed HSBC's British gold at eight Bents, one two five, and settled in Dutch American exchange at fifteen yuan, eight seven five. HSBC's listed donations were unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by one point, calculating 8.50%. After this, the yarn and flower gang suddenly came to dump it, so the potential slightly hardened, selling American exchange to a certain bank at fifteen yuan, nine zero six two five. After this, the market conditions became more silent. Only the money exchange sold Hong Kong exchange to a foreign bank at fifty-four yuan and five jiao. The banks' selling prices for British and American exchanges at noon closing were no different from the morning opening.</p>
<p>The market after that was still silent. First, foreign firms settled in a certain bank’s Huabi American exchange at fifteen yuan, eight seven five. Before long, Chinese businessmen also purchased and settled in McCallum’s British gold at eight Bents, one two five. Finally, money exchanges sold Hong Kong exchange to Huawei at fifty-four yuan and a half and three seven five. The banks' selling prices for British exchange at eight Bents, one two five, and American exchange at fifteen yuan, eight seven five, at the evening closing, with no honor or disgrace for both British and American exchanges compared to before the Spring Festival holiday.

<h3 id="e121">The Oddity of Gold Exchange Rate in Japan: Slightly Less Demand for British and American Gold Pounds <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of British pure gold dropped by half a percent. The exchange rate between British and American currencies remained unchanged. Due to the Lunar New Year holiday, there were few settlements and little supply or demand for foreign exchange. Market prices were stable, showing no significant changes compared to the end of the year. High-purity red gold was expensive and traded briskly, dropping slightly in an instant. In the afternoon, there was little trading in foreign currencies, but there was still strong demand for British and American gold pounds. It was said that foreign banks had a high demand for British gold pounds, making it difficult to find them on the market. Japanese gold certificates were the most actively traded, reaching over 50,000 yuan. Other currencies only fluctuated slightly. There were few transactions at the Exchange, with San Tai issuing 500 yuan of Hong Kong drafts through Tong Tong Yuan Jin. Cheng Tai issued 100 pounds of British gold certificates through Hong Chang Jin. Hui Tong issued 100 Swiss franc drafts through Tong Yuan Jin. Yesterday's market prices, compared to those before the Lunar New Year holiday, showed that British gold pounds rose by 1 jiao and 5 fen, British gold certificates fell by 2 fen, American gold pounds rose by 2 jiao, gold certificates fell by 7 li, Hong Kong dropped by 1 fen and 1 li, French franc certificates fell by 2 jiao and a half, Singapore and Dutch certificates each fell by 2 fen, Belgian and Canadian certificates each fell by 1 fen, Philippine certificates rose by 2 fen, Italian certificates fell by 2 fen, Australian gold certificates rose by 2 jiao, and Annam and German gold certificates did not change.</p>

<p>A London dispatch on the 22nd reported that speculators were actively trading, and there was some buying from American merchants and India, keeping the market relatively stable. After the close, the near-term market was sluggish, with slight selling from American merchants. In the long-term market, India resumed some buying. The near-term spot silver price continued to decline by 0.0625, while the long-term price rebounded by 0.375. A New York silver dispatch reported that American silver prices remained unchanged.

<h3 id="e124">Securities: First Sounds of the New Year Stock Market; Unified Bonds Soar; Foreign Debt Market Fluctuations Minimal <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>After an eight-day holiday, the informal securities market opened yesterday for the Lunar New Year, making the first sounds of the new year. The so-called "red market" trading was not bad. People still followed their customary habits from previous years, mostly taking long positions, believing it would bring good luck to buy in. Therefore, market prices rose by 7 or 8 jiao after the opening. In the first hour and a half of trading in the morning, market prices remained stable at the opening price. The overall situation was mostly in a period of incubation, with little change. The international situation in Hainan Island had not developed, and there were many uncertainties about the future. Therefore, most of the market was still in a wait-and-see mode. New Year trading regulations only allowed for half-day trading in the morning, with the market closing in the afternoon. Regular full-day trading would resume from the sixteenth day of the lunar calendar. Yesterday, due to buying on the 18th, prices initially surged by 6 jiao to 1 yuan. Although Ren Chang Hao covered their short positions, sales from Northern firms Nos. 11 and 14, as well as sales of Class B bonds by Nos. 38 and 5, slightly weakened market prices. However, most positions remained stable, resulting in an overall increase of 7 jiao to 1 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. The total turnover was estimated at around 500,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Over 400 shares of Dasheng Third Factory were traded at a price of 36 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debt: The listed prices on Wednesday, the 22nd of this month, showed minimal changes. The Sino-French American 5% bonds fell by another half pound, with a price of 66 and a half pounds. The Hukuang Railway Bonds (non-German version with Indian stamps) rose by 1 pound, with a price of 21 pounds. The Kowloon-Canton Railway Bonds fell by 1 pound, with a price of 18 and a half pounds. All other bonds remained unchanged. Actual supplies in London included 5,000 pounds of Hukuang Railway Bonds (non-German version with Indian stamps), sold at 21 pounds, at par. Sino-French American 5% bonds with Indian stamps, worth 3,000 pounds (equivalent to US$15,000), were sold at 67 and a half British pounds, or US$63.375. Another 2,000 pounds (equivalent to US$10,000) were sold at 66 pounds and 15 shillings, one pound and five shillings above the market. Reparation Bonds from German issues totaling 860 pounds were sold at 45 and a half pounds, five shillings lower than the previous quote.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Cotton Yarn: Red Market for Yarn Opens, Prices Rise and Fall; Cantonese Merchants are the Most Active; Short-Term Holders are Eager to Sell <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>After a six-day holiday, the yarn market opened yesterday with a "red market" atmosphere, and the situation was quite lively. In the southern part of China, the demand for coarse and fine yarns from Hong Kong, Fujian, Yunnan, and other regions was particularly strong. The market was bullish, and most brokers focused on the Cantonese merchants. The opening price for 30-count "Double Horse" yarn was 406 yuan, up 2 and a half yuan from the price at the end of last year. Cantonese merchants bought 140 bales on behalf of Hong Kong merchants. The price for 20-count "Shepherd" yarn was 382 yuan, and 100 bales were also purchased. The market initially showed enthusiasm, but soon softened. Some traders, seeing the constant disturbances in eastern Zhejiang by Japanese warships, felt slightly discouraged, and sellers were particularly eager, showing a slight sign of weakness. However, transactions from all parties were not weak, although fellow traders accounted for more than 50% of the transactions.</p>
<p>At the opening of the yarn market this morning, because of the yarn market transactions, the customers naturally bought according to the market price for auspicious reasons, in order to get a good omen. Cantonese merchants bought one after another, but the price was slightly increased by two or three yuan. Then, the idea that more sellers were going to come out was strong, and it was also said that although the situation in eastern Zhejiang was calm, the situation was still tight, and short-term holders were especially eager to sell. The market then fell back again, but the overall situation was still not bad. Business in the afternoon was still not weak, but the market price was slightly soft. In the end, the total number of bales bought by various parties in the front and rear markets was 3,235. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell by 5 jiao compared with the price before the holiday, "Heavenly Maiden" fell by 1 yuan, "Special Jincheng" fell by 3 yuan, "Double Globe" fell by 2 and a half yuan, 16-count yarn fell by 1 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 2 and a half yuan. The factory, by Litai Factory, opened with 100 bales of 20-count "Awakened Lion" yarn, priced at 385 yuan. Chongxin Factory opened with 800 bales of 20-count "Special Dafang" yarn, priced at 400 yuan, for the trade. The amounts bought by various parties are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market initially rose with Chinese yarn, and was once excited, but then fell back as the needs of all parties were bland. The closing price was 5 or 6 yuan different. In the end, the spot price of 20-count "Water Moon" yarn was 340 yuan to 34 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn was 335 yuan to 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Cotton Sales as Quiet as Ever; Prices Without Much Change <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton was quiet for several days, and all industries were taking a wait-and-see attitude. Even the issue of the US government's cotton loan sales, which has attracted the most attention, has been discussed for several days, but there has been no definite result yet. However, it is generally expected that the government will not immediately sell the loan cotton at the market price. Yesterday was Washington's Birthday, and New York was closed as usual, but the forecast for the March cotton price was 8.47. Indian and Egyptian cotton prices did not change much from before the holiday, and the exchange rate was also the same. Converted to legal tender, American and Brazilian cotton prices did not move from before the holiday, Indian cotton fell by 2 jiao and a half, and Egyptian cotton rose by 3 jiao and more.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was very quiet because the red market price of yarn did not rise and some factories had not officially opened for business. Only the Xinsheng Yarn Factory purchased 500 Indian cotton blocks from Bai Luoqu District to decorate the red market. The Japanese factories had a large number of goods arriving, so the trading had not yet started. However, it is generally expected that there will be a large number of domestic and foreign cotton transactions within a few days. Yesterday's cotton prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Converted Market Price</p>
<p>The cotton market began with a red market, but business still did not develop. Half of the reason was that all roads were still difficult, and the stocks in this port were exhausted. Therefore, it was difficult to relax on the cotton itself, but based on the world cotton industry situation, the price of this cotton was already high. The factory was extremely unwilling to purchase, so there was a stalemate. All parties did not take action to purchase, and there were few transactions among the trade, and the selling price was not energetic, without much change from the price before the holiday. No source of goods was heard from the wharf. The transaction volume and market price of the current cotton are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Piece Goods: Opening Prices of Cotton Cloth Mostly Increased; No Business Transactions in Eastern Zhejiang; Eastern Piece Goods Held a Wait-and-See Attitude <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The opening prices of domestic cloth yesterday mostly increased. Colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth increased by 1 jiao to 5 jiao per bolt. Striped and plain crepe increased by 3 jiao to 6 jiao per bolt. White goods coarse cloth increased by 1 jiao to 2 jiao per bolt. Fine cloth and fine twill increased by 2 jiao and 3 jiao. British-owned Qiahe Factory coarse cloth added 1 jiao, fine cloth, fine twill, and bleached cloth added 2 jiao. Luen Chang Factory printed cloth added 0.5 jiao, bleached cloth, feather silk, satin, etc. added 1 jiao. However, actual selling prices still varied. The more prosperous business was in Yunnan, where more than 200 boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, and line fabrics were transacted, and 30-40 bales of white goods fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth were transacted. Shantou and Hong Kong merchants also bought 50-60 boxes of bleached and dyed cloth, and Fujian merchants bought more than 100 boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and line fabrics. Due to the interruption of the shipping route to Haimen in Eastern Zhejiang, the ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou were unsettled and in a wait-and-see mode, resulting in no movement in the red market trading. There was a slight decoration in this street, because wholesale transactions in stores were still too early.</p>
<p>There were few red market transactions for Dongbu cloth. Only Tianjin merchants added dozens of bales of colored ball and flying fish brand fine cloth in the morning, with a selling price of 12 yuan and 4 jiao per bolt. There were very few transactions on this street, because the price of the goods was too high and the intention to purchase turned light. Wholesale customers all held a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the development of actual sales, because the current market price of fine cloth and fine twill had uniformly increased by 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao per bolt compared with the market price last year. The futures price of the trade was even more increased, and yesterday's opening price of colored balls and fine cloth had to be 12 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, and the asking price of Longtou fine cloth was 12 yuan and 4 jiao and a half to 5 jiao. The spot market price was 1 jiao lower per bolt than the futures price, but there was not much to say. Four gentlemen serge colored goods were 3 jiao and 9.25 fen per yard, and Zhigong was 3 jiao and 9.75 fen. Tianjin merchants purchased about 100 boxes.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Silk and Tea: Silk Market Situation Enthusiastic; Japanese and American Silk Prices Rise Even More Sharply <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms opened their doors for business. During the Spring Festival holiday, Japanese and American silk prices rose even more sharply. Yokohama spot prices opened at 965 yuan yesterday, and forward prices opened at 944 yuan, a sharp increase of 14 yuan to 15 yuan compared with before the holiday. New York was closed yesterday for Washington's Birthday, but prices also rose compared with before the holiday. Japanese silk was 2.13 yuan and 75 fen, and 2.07 yuan, each up by 4 fen. Shanghai silk was 2.03 yuan for 7/8 fen, and Guangdong silk was 1.43 yuan, each up by 1 fen. Lyon Japanese silk was 1.79 francs, up by 2 francs. Shanghai silk A was 1.885 francs, B was 170 francs, and Guangdong silk was 144 francs, up by 1 franc to 2 francs each.</p>
<p>The red market for silk in this port saw a consistent rise in silk prices, and it was speculated that the trend was still strong. Baiguang silk was only used for telegrams to respond to the needs of users in the market. Baichang B RR 20-22 lines were sold at 1640 yuan, and this was worth 1620 yuan. The inner and printing shops of the Jili Classics each had red market transactions. The Silver Fish grade opened at 1,005 yuan, and the Qilin Running Horse opened at 1,000 yuan, each rising by more than 20 yuan compared with before the holiday. A total of 40 dans were transacted inside and outside, and the situation can be said to be enthusiastic, but transactions still inevitably had a sense of makeshift.</p>
<p>Yesterday, ten pieces of Huzhou silk were transported to New York by the Liang Tai Yin Lun.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Oil Cake: Rumors of Production Areas Being Organized; Soybean Oil Transactions Increase Greatly; Opening Prices Soar and Japanese Merchants Sell; Zhejiang and Fujian Soybean Cake Outlets Also Prosper <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The red market situation for oil cake was higher than the closing price at the time of the great result. The oil market was rumored to be organized in the producing areas, which led to hoarding and increased transactions. The opening price rose by 7, 8, and 9 jiao. Midway, Japanese merchants released a batch of futures, and although the market was flattened, it did not replace the opportunity for man-made. A total of 1,500 pieces and 100 barrels of peanut oil were transacted, and the futures orders for soybean oil, including the quick orders, were about 3,400 barrels or more, all of which were for the trade to go out. Actual sales were not heard to be ordered. Soybean cake also rose by 6 fen compared with the previous market, and the foot was still strong. Yesterday, the Wenzhou and Taizhou merchants went to handle 3,000 pieces of five-brand cake, and the Xinghua and Quanzhou merchants took 16,000 pieces of four-brand cake.</p>

<p>Flour market red market transactions, the customer's outlet, are all active, because there have been no smooth transactions for many days during the holiday. The flour that was purchased last year was also continuously shipped out at the end of the year, so the stomach of the north and south customers is quite good. There are inquiries in Ji, Lu, Fu, Shan and other places. However, the foreign wheat that each factory has ordered will arrive in Shanghai one after another. It is said that during the holiday, in addition to the 24,000 bags of American relief wheat that arrived, a new boat of wheat ordered by a factory also arrived. It is said that each factory has abundant raw materials and is rushing to make flour. The spring holiday parking only lasted for two days, and then the factory started to produce flour day and night in order to supply it. Therefore, yesterday's red market spot and futures transactions reached more than 100,000 bags, and the price of the February share was 4 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, and the result has been reduced by 5 fen. The sales volume of Nos. 3 and 4 is not much, and the price is still stable. Today, 3,500 bags of flour will be shipped to Weihai, and 4,000 bags will be shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Wheat Market Lack of Trade During the holiday, there are a total of more than 10,000 bags of raw goods in various places, and only 3,500 bags of stock last year. The market supply is still abundant. The intake of each factory is still of a courtesy nature due to the continuous arrival of the foreign wheat previously ordered, and has not been greedy, while the seller refuses to sell due to the red market example of shouting high, so both parties mutually held. Until the afternoon, the transaction has not been properly made, because the time is late, so it is said that it will be opened for sale again today.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Miscellaneous Grains: Sales Did Not Move; Market Price Rarely Increased or Decreased <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Miscellaneous grains, the red market situation, the prices of various goods have increased by 1-2 jiao on the surface, but its potential has not changed much, because the sales market of each group is not active. Yesterday, it was estimated that this street handled Dalian beans, and Guangs厦 本街 分 was separated from Sand Yellow beans for more than 700 bags, and from the Du beans for 50 bags. Fuzhou 幫 took 400 bags of Jiading white broad beans, Shantou 云沙 red beans for 100 bags, and Xiamen 幫 asked for 300 bags of 揀莞 beans. The vegetable bearer in Wujiang took 100 bags of 揀 青 beans from this street.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat bran red market only opened a batch of factory doctors, counting a total of 10,000 bags of Xin Fu and Cai Feng, priced at 4 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. Only 200 bags of Fu were traded in the market, priced at 4 yuan and 1 jiao and 75 fen, because at the end of Qingle last year, the mainland bag was set to fall within the 4 yuan mark, which made the market stagnant. At that time, the long-headed company of a certain business specializing in business took the opportunity to search and let the price go to 4 yuan in cash, so the active chips in the market suddenly disappeared during this red market period, the factory market was lifted enough, and the door was closed, so it created this bad Zhou surface, and it is feared that the future trend will lose its accuracy from now on.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Consistently Tight <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>

<p>Northern goods prices generally increased (see market price column), but prices were high, and spring sales may not be too strong.

<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>We often hear the phrase, "There's no solution." Difficult or complicated matters supposedly have no solution, and even clear, easy tasks are declared unsolvable. This has no solution, that has no solution, and sure enough, it leaves everyone with no solution.</p>
<p>Is it really true that there's no solution? I don't believe it! To "lift Mount Tai to cross the North Sea" is certainly impossible, but "to break off a branch for an elder," how can that be impossible? Moreover, "Yu Gong Moves the Mountain," and "Jingwei Fills the Sea," are ultimately solutions. The so-called "no solution" is, as Mencius said, "It is a failure to act, not an inability to do!"</p>
<p>Two plus two equals four. Before the discovery that two plus two equals four, this fact was already in existence. This "equals four" is the solution. All other new inventions and discoveries are also originally existing solutions. From this, we can know that there are many new things in the universe, which are originally existing solutions, waiting for us to invent and discover them. To say "there is no solution" is not only unwise, but simply unreasonable. If, because of the belief that there is no solution, we miss or sacrifice the easiest to invent or discover solution, that is truly a great pity!</p>
<p>The War of Resistance is the solution for national construction. Who can still say that national construction has no solution? The various processes and things in the War of Resistance are indeed complicated and difficult, but since our entire nation has come together to work with spirit, countless difficulties have already been solved, and the unsolved difficulties are certainly being solved. Who can still say that something has no solution? "No solution" is just an excuse for those who abandon themselves and wallow in depravity!</p>
<p>Recently, regarding the export of native goods, which is vital to the economy, there have been two excellent solutions: First, those who go to the interior of Shanghai to purchase goods, and those who export from the interior, are all certified by the chamber of commerce, specifically for their own use, and not to aid the enemy; Second, native goods are concentrated in Hong Kong for export, and the government purchases them in advance and implements control. The conscription law, which concerns military affairs, has also been more completely revised. There are countless other administrative measures that are being carried out in the best way, one after another, which is enough to confirm my point of view and comfort those who worry unnecessarily.</p>
<p>I hope that I will no longer hear such excuses and discouraging words as "there is no solution" for anything. "Knowing is difficult, acting is easy" is a definite principle. As long as we act, we will know. Therefore, as long as we work, we will find a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e139">A Female Warrior <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Xin</p>
<p>It was dusk when we arrived at ×× Mountain Town, which was originally a very small town. After repeated trampling by the enemy's iron hooves, it had become even more desolate and deserted. The piercingly cold wind was quite strong, stirring up dust. Looking out at the road, it was a yellowish-brown and devoid of a single person. It lay there quietly, like a huge python.</p>
<p>After several inspections and interrogations, we finally found the place we were looking for. We had dinner with several armed comrades in the team headquarters. Although the food was very rough, we ate with extra relish after a whole day of labor.</p>
<p>Team Leader Y was a very interesting young man, and the other comrades were also very enthusiastic. Their cheerful conversations, especially when they talked about the combat situation, were so vivid and lively that people would forget their fatigue.</p>
<p>In a dilapidated earth god temple, I met a female comrade. It turned out that she was from my hometown, but we weren't very familiar with each other before. We started talking enthusiastically. Her name was Meng Ying, and her old home was outside the north gate of Qingpu, which had already fallen into the hands of the enemy. She had studied at the Shanghai Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School and had a very strong body, just like her strong personality. After her home was destroyed, she came here to be a female warrior, and it had been a full half year.</p>
<p>She was only twenty years old this year, very lively, and spoke with excitement, her voice as rough as a man's. She told me:</p>
<p>"Before Qingpu fell, I joined the local 'Women's Wartime Service Corps' and worked there. Because I didn't understand hypocrisy and accommodation, all the rough and heavy work that others didn't want to do was taken on by me. Because of this, I also gained the love of my comrades.</p>
<p>"However, it was very unfortunate that after the enemy planes constantly bombed the Qingpu city, we were driven to the countryside. Soon, we scattered again, and we haven't heard from each other since." Speaking of this, she seemed very touched.</p>
<p>After I took out a cigarette and puffed on it, she continued:</p>
<p>"Since arriving here, I have fought the enemy four times, and we have won every time. Some people say how good the enemy's combat power is, but these are just people who are afraid of them. According to my several experiences, the enemy is very afraid of death. What they rely on is just sharp weapons. When it comes to brave fighting, only our soldiers have it." She waved her arms excitedly, took a sip of water, and continued:</p>
<p>"Once, on a place called ×× Village along the Qinghu Highway, I ran into three Japanese devils. That was really exciting! When they saw that I was a single woman, they surrounded me, speaking gibberish Chinese. They thought I was a weak Chinese woman with no ability to resist. Humph, they were really blind, running right into my hands." She smiled at me as she spoke, and I looked eagerly at her lips.</p>
<p>"So I used a trick and smiled back at them," she continued. "They were so happy they almost went crazy. They wanted to grab my arm, but I immediately pulled out my weapon and quickly sent them to their deaths. It was a lesson they never dreamed of... I didn't waste the fourth bullet, it was so satisfying. This time, I also got two good rifles and a pistol. That pistol is now worn by Team Leader Y."</p>
<p>Meng Ying spoke very excitedly, also saying that meeting me, a fellow villager, made her very happy. Because she was the only local person here, and the other comrades were all young people from other provinces.</p>
<p>I looked at this brave female warrior with great astonishment. She suddenly rolled up the sleeves of her gray cloth coat, revealing a scar the size of a peanut on the upper part of her right arm.</p>
<p>Then she told me that in the four battles over the past six months, she had killed a total of eleven Japanese devils and was only slightly injured once.</p>
<p>What a glorious mark that was.</p>
<p>On the misty morning of the third day, we left ×× Mountain. On the way, I silently wished this female warrior health and a bright future.</p>

<p>This war of resistance of the entire nation,</p>
<p>I have not shouldered the mission of youth,</p>
<p>Nor have I fulfilled my responsibilities as a citizen!</p>
<p>A stimulus,</p>

<h3 id="e141">Nothing to be Surprised At <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Xie</p>
<p>Traitors have existed since ancient times, it didn't start with me, nothing to be surprised at. Turtles and bastards are all made by people, I am also like others, I will just do it, nothing to be surprised at. Let them laugh and scold as they please, I will be a good official myself, nothing to be surprised at...</p>
<p>How many sins in the world are lightly created in this self-justification of "nothing to be surprised at." "Nothing to be surprised at" is specialized in glossing over mistakes, it's simply an evil and ominous term.</p>
<p>However, "nothing to be surprised at" cannot be generalized. When used properly, it can often embolden people and strengthen their will, and achieve results in certain events.</p>
<p>To be unfazed by the strange, and the strange will defeat itself, is the best annotation of "nothing to be surprised at." For example, the enemy has fierce guns and cannons, nothing to be surprised at, we have a new Great Wall made of flesh and blood; the enemy may use flowery words, or strong arguments to confuse people, nothing to be surprised at, we have our own ideas; the enemy boasts loudly and makes false threats, nothing to be surprised at, our will is firm, and our expression does not change even when Mount Tai collapses in front of us...</p>
<p>However, under this "nothing to be surprised at," it can be seen that we must have something to rely on, a way to conduct ourselves, only then is it good. Otherwise, this "nothing to be surprised at" will become another explanation, as in the following examples:</p>
<p>When Emperor Chen Houzhu heard the news of the Sui army crossing the river, he was still singing "Jade Tree Back Courtyard Flower" with the palace ladies, "nothing to be surprised at" turned into a poisonous tranquilizer. When the Yuan soldiers had already approached Jiankang, Ma Shidao believed that ceding land and paying tribute was enough, and raising crickets was still important, "nothing to be surprised at" ruined the country and himself. When Li Zicheng broke through Juyongguan and entered directly, the general ministers of the Ming court were still singing and dancing, living in a drunken stupor, "nothing to be surprised at" turned into being more than deserving of death...</p>
<p>What is the explanation for this kind of "nothing to be surprised at"? It's nothing more than intentionally not buying in, and deliberately making a mess.</p>
<p>At this point, we should all know whether or not we should be "nothing to be surprised at," and under what circumstances can we be "nothing to be surprised at."</p>
<p>However, what has been said above is all about national affairs, which seems to be too broad. On a personal level, how should this "nothing to be surprised at" be applied? Let me use myself as an example:</p>
<p>Someone told me that someone has changed, has become bad. I said, "Nothing to be surprised at, the world is inherently easy to corrupt people." Someone has been promoted and made a fortune. I said, "Nothing to be surprised at, everyone has opportunities." Someone has been unkind and insidious to me for no reason. I dismiss it with a smile, feeling that "nothing to be surprised at," because the wickedness of people's hearts was already in my expectation. Someone wants me to go see the newly emerging Western sights, Eastern sights, I don't go, because I know, it's just the same old thing anyway, "nothing to be surprised at." No matter what troubles, hardships, difficulties, setbacks, or all the unbearable things I encounter, I will use "nothing to be surprised at" to dismiss them all. I admit that "nothing to be surprised at" has great benefits for me, and I often use it.</p>
<p>Even if I encounter a situation where I can truly commit suicide, I will still live on. The reason is that death, in my eyes, is also "nothing to be surprised at." Everyone will commit suicide, everyone will die, so why should I follow the crowd and follow in their footsteps?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is still my passive "nothing to be surprised at," and it may be unworthy of imitation? However, I feel that any ordeal, in my eyes, is still "nothing to be surprised at," and I can do it, if the environment and opportunities allow me. I myself cannot tell whether my "nothing to be surprised at" is passive or active.</p>
<p>I don't know if people nowadays have the concept of "nothing to be surprised at," and I don't even know what kind of "nothing to be surprised at" they have, if they do, and to what extent. Perhaps everyone will say that I am "nothing to be surprised at" after hearing me say this.</p>

<h3 id="e142">In the Flames of War <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>6.  A Paradise</p>
<p>As the war situation evolved, more and more towns in the Jiangnan area fell. However, He Pu Town became a paradise unanimously recognized by refugees. Because the transportation here was inconvenient and it was not a strategic stronghold, residents from the Sujiahu area came here to escape the chaos, making this medium-sized town, which had never been taken seriously, almost unable to accommodate them.</p>
<p>All the worries and fears caused by the approaching war have been swept away since Regiment Commander Ye led his troops to garrison here. At this time, it was as if the clouds had broken and the moon had come out, becoming even brighter. Due to the influx of refugees and the increase in population, the town's market has experienced unprecedented prosperity. Not only have many shops gained unexpected profits, but even families with three acres of land and two houses have been able to rent them out at good prices because there are not enough houses in the town to meet the needs of the refugees. Farmers no longer have to worry about being unable to sell the harvested rice, because the demand for grain has increased, but the supply has been blocked. They only worry about having too little, not too much. The price of rice has risen more than twice as high as before the war, and there is a continuing upward trend.</p>
<p>Apart from some imported daily necessities, such as oil, kerosene, candles, matches, and soap, which feel scarce due to transportation disruptions, people living in the town do not feel any inconvenience, and no one even thinks that not far from here, war is raging and they are suffering an unprecedented catastrophe. Since the × soldiers have never visited once, and the bandits do not dare to steal because they are afraid of Regiment Commander Ye's troops, this place is indeed worthy of being called a paradise. Everyone even gave it a special nickname, calling it "Little Shanghai."</p>
<p>The prosperity of this "Little Shanghai" is undoubtedly entirely built on Regiment Commander Ye's troops. On the one hand, Regiment Commander Ye worked hard to maintain law and order, and on the other hand, he did not forget to innovate local administration. His first step was to re-investigate the town's household registration, so that criminals had nowhere to hide. The second step was to take advantage of the winter slack season to actively organize training for able-bodied men. Whether or not they had received training, all eligible men had to re-enter the camp for training. In addition, he also encouraged the people to build bomb shelters in their homes, and ordered his soldiers to build a watchtower in the town. Every day, people were sent to the top of the tower to monitor in shifts. If the enemy's aircraft were found, the bell would be rung to warn immediately. The wood needed to build the watchtower was entirely donated by Cai Hefeng, the owner of Hefeng Lumber.</p>
<p>All of Regiment Commander Ye's measures were unanimously praised by people with foresight, but there were also some selfish and short-sighted people who not only refused to follow his orders, but also said that he was busy doing nothing. Among them, Dong Yang Yueliang was one of the most critical of him.</p>
<p>Yang Yueliang, relying on his past superior status, engaged in usury in the town, lending money at high interest rates and exploiting farmers as much as possible. He had a strange temper, which was that he did not believe in banknotes, only in silver dollars. He often said to people: "Silver dollars are always made of silver, banknotes are just a piece of paper, what do they count for!" So he tried his best to collect silver dollars and tried to melt them into silver ingots and hide them in his home. Everyone knew that he had money at home, but he pretended to be very poor on the outside.</p>
<p>At first, he was very flattering to Regiment Commander Ye. The reason was very simple, just for the sake of power. Later, when Regiment Commander Ye led his troops here, not only did he not get any benefits, but he also lost a lot of personal interests. The army's supplies had to be borne by him in part, and because his house was tall, half of it was borrowed to station troops, so he could not free up empty houses to rent to refugees from outside. Therefore, his dissatisfaction grew day by day, and he often said to people that the garrison in the town was superfluous, and he encouraged everyone to ask Regiment Commander Ye to withdraw his troops to other places.

<h3 id="e143">Two Speeches by Chairman Chiang <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Quan</p>
<p>In recent days, the newspapers have published two speeches by Chairman Chiang. One was a radio speech on the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement on the 18th, and the other was a speech at the third session of the National Political Council held in Chongqing on the 12th of this month. These two speeches are closely related to us citizens. However, these days everyone is busy looking for "happiness" in the abolished Lunar New Year, and not many people are paying attention to state affairs. According to a news vendor, the newspapers he sold in these two or three days of the New Year were less than half of what he usually sells. From this, it can be seen that most of the citizens on the isolated island only know how to look for "happiness" and have put national affairs aside!</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang instructed us: "Dignified and orderly discipline, generous sacrifice, substantial frugality, and vigorous struggle." Now, let's earnestly reflect on whether we have struggled? Have we obeyed discipline? Have we sacrificed? Have we been frugal? Most of the citizens, in this abolished Lunar New Year, are still unwilling to let go and are looking for "happiness." May I ask, are they worthy of the country? I hope that after reading Chairman Chiang's speeches, the citizens on the isolated island will be alert. The New Life Movement takes "clarifying propriety, righteousness, knowing integrity, and being responsible" as its guideline. The rules of the New Life Movement are the rules of life for all Chinese people. From now on, we must improve our lives, promote the wartime life of the people, and achieve the "militarization," "productionization," and "rationalization" of life in order to cope with the great situation of this extraordinary period!</p>
<p>"The task of the second phase of the War of Resistance is to concentrate and exert all our strength in the front and rear, and even in the occupied areas, to strive for final victory and the success of national construction." "In addition to continuing to focus on military and material matters, we must pay special attention to spiritual resistance!" "I believe that strengthening the spirit, concentrating the spirit, and leading the national spiritual mobilization with our words and actions should be the central focus of this conference." The above is what Chairman Chiang said in the National Political Council. This time, Chairman Chiang advocated leading the national spiritual mobilization with words and actions. Citizens living on the isolated island must pay close attention—we are now trapped in this environment of being surrounded by enemies on all sides. We must take out all our strength and our spirit to resist the violence in order to strive for final victory and the success of national construction!</p>
<p>"Everyone of us puts the interests of the country and the nation in the first place, and we must also extend this to others, believing that the citizens of the Republic of China all have a patriotic conscience. With common beliefs, there must be mutual trust. How can we achieve sincerity and purity? Being able to sacrifice for the country and the nation is sincerity, and having no other distracting thoughts besides the country and the nation is purity. For the sake of the country, we do not hesitate to die, let alone other things. We must all stand on the first position of the country and the nation, publicize for the sake of the country and the nation, act for the sake of the country and the nation, and even think for the sake of the country and the nation. We must make sincere efforts ourselves, but we must purely work hard for the country, and then can we generate common strength to deal with common enemies and complete our common aspirations!"</p>
<p>Although most of the citizens on the isolated island are working hard for the cause of national salvation, there are still many who are living recklessly, selfishly, and placing national crisis out of mind. If these people truly do not forget the country, they should immediately cheer up, take out their spirit to resist the enemy, and fulfill their duties as citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Monthly Salary · Bonuses · Debt <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Li Liang</p>
<p>—The Economic Situation of Shanghai's Salaried Class</p>
<p>In Shanghai, a civil servant with a monthly salary of one hundred yuan naturally lives much better than an old-fashioned shop employee with a monthly salary of only thirty or forty yuan. However, in reality, although the monthly income of old-fashioned shop employees is meager, many of them can save some money by the end of the year. On the other hand, civil servants have to borrow money to get through the year. The reason is very simple: civil servants earn and spend each month, and by the end of the year, bills come flying in like snowflakes, making it impossible to cope. Old-fashioned shop employees also earn and spend each month, but by the end of the year, they receive bonuses and salary increases, which are quite considerable. Using this extra income to pay off debts and get through the New Year is more than enough. Although daily expenses may be slightly insufficient on weekdays, and they have to borrow from here and there, at the very least, they can pay off all their old debts with the extra income at the end of the year. At the same time, civil servants, once they borrow money, have no extra income to draw from in addition to their monthly salary, so they inevitably accumulate more and more debt and cannot extricate themselves.</p>
<p>Although it is the same to support a family of several people, those who have a monthly income of one hundred yuan or more must live in a style that is commensurate with that amount. Those who have a monthly income of only thirty or forty yuan or less will have to reduce their style accordingly. This is the general rule for living and enjoying life in Shanghai, so there is a saying that goes, "Earn more, spend more; earn less, spend less." In other words, no matter how much you earn, it is not easy to save money from your monthly salary. Because earning one hundred yuan and squeezing your living expenses down to fifty yuan is something that Shanghai people would rather die than do. Therefore, those who earn thirty or forty yuan a month are penniless by the end of the month, and those who earn one hundred or two hundred yuan a month are also as anxious as ants on a hot pot, eagerly waiting for the day they receive their salary.</p>
<p>What has been said above only concerns monthly salary and life. Old-fashioned shop employees are naturally the lowest-paid group among the gentry class at present. However, if we put aside the merits and demerits of daily life and consider the general economic situation, perhaps the group with the lowest debt is still the old-fashioned shop employees. According to the statistics of a friend who works at a loan bank that specializes in small credit loans, in the past four years, among the debtors, those who work in old-fashioned shops account for slightly less than 10%; those who work in foreign companies, banks, and companies account for slightly less than 40%; those so-called civil servants who work in government agencies account for slightly more than 40%; and others account for about 10%. From this, we can already understand the economic situation of Shanghai people. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<h3 id="e145">Window Life <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>In these recent years, unless you have noble relatives or the recommendation and promotion of powerful people, it is really not easy to find a position that can barely maintain the minimum necessities of life. Since the outbreak of the war, this problem of job panic has become even more widespread and serious. People who originally had positions and lived comfortably have now had their positions bombed away by the ruthless artillery fire; people who had no jobs in the first place have become even more pitiable today because the number of people competing has increased. Aren't the streets and alleys now filled with the sounds of layoffs, salary reductions, and unpaid leave? From this point of view, we can say that those who currently have positions, no matter how low and humble, are quite lucky people, and they certainly have reasons to work carefully and not break their rice bowls.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I work at the "window" of a certain organization. When handling every matter, I am always careful and unwilling to let there be any mistakes. Sometimes, I even try my best to endure all kinds of troubles and put on a smiling face to treat the people outside the "window." - Never offend anyone, this is the core of my work.</p>
<p>Speaking of "windows," they are the media for various banks and organizations to contact the outside world. Like the "shopkeepers" in general stores, those who work at the "window" must also have extraordinary experience and other qualifications. Okay, from the difficulty of finding a job to my working principles at the "window," now I'm talking about "window life" again. Let me report on it a bit later.</p>
<p>Those who work at the "window" must first have rich experience to be competent. Although there are "information desks" set up in various organizations and banks, ordinary people do not seem to be very happy to go there. In this situation, the people sitting by the window have to prepare to deal with the various questions raised by these people. They will ask you all kinds of strange and bizarre questions from various departments. Sometimes, even though you are sitting under the window for receiving telegraphic transfers, they will bring a large pile of things that have nothing to do with telegraphic transfers to ask about, or they will even talk to you endlessly. At this time, you are extremely busy with your work. If you don't pay attention to them, you are afraid they will roar. If you talk to them, you won't have time to do your work. They won't know this kind of dilemma in your heart.</p>
<p>In addition to experience, people living a "window life" must also have extraordinary patience. The many irrelevant questions mentioned above can sometimes really cause inner annoyance. If the person asking you has a rude and reckless temper, and you don't have good patience, then you will get angry from being asked, or you may even have a fight, which is bound to be a fact that you will see. Therefore, people who work at the "window," even if you have a thousand kinds of unspeakable suffering, annoyance, and troubles in your heart, you still have to put on a satisfactory and pleasing smile on your face. Otherwise, if you are always sullen and have a dejected look on your face, then someone will say that you have a bad temper, or even scold you "chi lao" in person, or even report you to your superiors, causing your rice bowl to be broken without you even realizing it.</p>
<p>In addition, every "teller" also needs quick hands and feet and a nimble tongue. On the one hand, you have to answer this person's questions with your mouth. On the other hand, your hands have to quickly handle various matters for that person. People sitting by the "window" must have a clear head and must be quick-witted, quick-tongued, quick-minded, and quick-handed. Otherwise, if you do your work slowly, the impatient "window people" who are unwilling to wait even a little will make a noise and shout all kinds of unbearable curses, scaring you into a flurry and causing you to do everything wrong.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are countless people living this kind of mechanical, passive, and unfree "window life." All their original tempers and dispositions have been conquered by the outside world. Even those who still have some remaining anger must suppress their temper slightly when they think of the difficulty of finding a job and the suffering after unemployment. No wonder someone said, "After eating three years of window rice, this person's anger is completely gone." The suffering of window life is not difficult to see from this.</p>

<p>Chapter Four: Recalling the Past, Le Tian Shares Witty Remarks; Forging New Friendships, Delightful Excursions in a Scenic Spot</p>
<p>There was another international news item, quite miraculous, about various countries using a scientific method to transform deserts into fertile land. This was initially proposed by several Soviet geologists and meteorologists, and later scientists from other countries also responded. Many theories were published, and this fable of turning the sea into mulberry fields was actually going to be done practically by humans. At first, it was just published as articles in magazines, but those scientists were not content with just talking about it. They believed that if they could say it, they should do it. The world's most enormous projects are started with the most foolish methods. Even when railways were first invented, it was just using two iron bars, to be laid straight for thousands of miles, what a clumsy design! But now that railways are accessible in all directions, who would dare to say it's clumsy? Even airplanes, at first, were just developed from the kites flown by children. Now they are preparing to start experimenting in several small sandy areas first. They have organized a group similar to a company, digging rivers, planting trees, and various other things are underway. This is very relevant to China, because there are also several deserts within China. After reporting these news items, the train was gradually approaching Suzhou. Zhao Letian knew that they were all going to Suzhou. Knowing that the two Miss He sisters were from Guangdong, he asked, "Are you going to Suzhou for sightseeing? There are many places to visit in Suzhou now." Wu Junsu replied on their behalf, "No! They are also going to Freedom Village." Zhao Letian was delighted to hear this and said, "Going to Freedom Village? That village head, Mr. Zhu Laoyuan, is still my old friend. If you see Village Head Zhu, please give him my regards. Just say that Zhao Letian, the one-legged madman, met him on the train, and he will know." As he spoke, he laughed heartily. Wu Junsu said, "So Mr. Zhao and Village Head Zhu are old friends. The two sisters are going to visit Village Head Zhu's granddaughter, Zhu Airen, a female doctor. Because those two sisters were classmates with Zhu Airen in the United States and were very close. After returning to their respective hometowns, this time, because the two He sisters accompanied their father to Shanghai, they specifically want to visit Zhu Airen." Zhao Letian said, "Excellent! Speaking of which, everyone knows each other. Village Head Zhu is my old friend, he's missing an arm, and I'm missing a leg. I often joke with him, saying, 'The two of us together have three arms and three legs.' Three legs is nothing, but three arms doesn't sound good"? (44)</p>

<p>Eldest Daughter Ruoying Returns from Chongqing *Flower-Sprinkled Tears* is First Performance</p>
<p>The China Travel Drama Troupe, led by Tang Huaiqiu, fell apart when Jiang Ming and others left to form the China Art Drama Troupe, as the troupe members were completely dispersed. After Tang's active efforts, the "China Travel Drama Troupe" was officially announced to be rebuilt on January 1st. More than twenty new members have been recruited, and several Cantonese female stars have joined. The troupe's address is at 11 Phoenix Lane in Hong Kong. The room is small and crowded, which is quite inadequate, but Huaiqiu said well: "..." However, the cost of living in Hong Kong is too high, and houses are so difficult to find, so we can only make do with what we have. Fortunately, what is valuable in a group, a drama group, is not the beauty of the rehearsal venue, but the unity of spirit. What an artist, a drama activist seeks is not comfort in life, but the realization of work. Therefore, a simple material life is not considered苦 by a drama worker at all...".</p>
<p>Tang's eldest daughter, Ruoying, previously left China Travel to meet her lover, Wang Xiawen, in Changsha. The Changsha fire broke out, and it was rumored that Ruoying had been buried in the fire. Later, it was learned that she had fled to Chongqing and has now arrived in Hong Kong, becoming a mainstay of the rebuilt "China Travel" with her younger sister, Ruoqing. The first play to be performed by the rebuilt "China Travel" has been scheduled as Yu Ling's *Flower-Sprinkled Tears*. Tang Huaiqiu serves as the director, and the actors include Ruoying as Dingxiang, Ruoqing as Mimi, Long Jiabin as Chang Haicai, Ye Dexi as Manli, Zhao Shu as Xiao Li, Chen Ping as Jin Shiyin, Chen Yu as Xiao Chen, Xia Meili as Gu Xiaomei, and others.</p>
<p>After the "China Travel" is rebuilt and established, in addition to performing in Mandarin, a Cantonese group will be formed to perform in Cantonese. The performance date for "Flower-Sprinkled Tears" is expected to be in late February.</p>

<p>A Chat with Fan Baizhu on New Year's Eve: Joining the Queen's Theater is Out of Passivity</p>
<p>Gai Jiaotian, among the veteran performers in the south, has become the last remaining short-play martial arts actor. He has deep-rooted old moral concepts. He keeps his promises and works with others in good faith, but if there is any displeasure, he will definitely leave decisively. He is especially generous to his friends. Here are some recent events to share with readers.</p>
<p>My friend Fan Baizhu was the owner of a newspaper office in Wujin before the war and was known in the Wujin community for promoting social welfare and drama. Several years ago, Gai Jiaotian jointly ran a theater in Changzhou and brought his Zhang family troupe, including Little Gai Jiaotian, Zhang Yipeng, Zhang Zhibin, Zhang Guobin, Qi Caifen, Zhang Yueting, Zhao Yulan, and others, to perform in Changzhou. It was during the hot season, the theater was small and stuffy, and business was not very good. The person who collaborated with Gai Jiaotian gave Gai Jiaotian various frustrations. At the end, the other party refused to hand over the money that Gai Jiaotian was entitled to, causing Gai Jiaotian and his group to be unable to move in Changzhou. Upon hearing this, Fan Baizhu stood up for justice and spoke many truths to the other party, saying that they should not bully outsiders with local power. Thanks to Fan's words, Gai Jiaotian was able to return to Shanghai smoothly. After the war, Fan lived in Shanghai as a guest, but never visited Gai Jiaotian once.</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, Fan Jun, entrusted by a certain newspaper, went to Gai Jiaotian's residence specifically to seek an advertisement for the Queen's Theater for the newspaper. After sending in his name card, he was received. Gai Jiaotian welcomed the guest and told everyone in the room to leave. Then he invited Fan upstairs, treated Fan with great respect, and expressed his gratitude for Fan's strong assistance in Changzhou in the past. Gai Jiaotian may have mistakenly thought that Fan Jun had come to transfer funds, so he first told Fan Jun that if he needed anything, he should tell him truthfully. Lao Wu (Gai Jiaotian referring to himself) was in Shanghai, which was not comparable to the situation in Wujin. His words were straightforward and sincere. Fan Jun smiled and said to Gai Jiaotian, "You are truly an ancient gentleman, with a generous and old-fashioned heart, I deeply admire you! I came here only to seek an advertisement deal for a friend." Gai Jiaotian readily agreed and then talked about things since they last met for about an hour before parting. Gai Jiaotian also said that his agreement with the Queen's Theater was purely to save face for a friend before agreeing to perform on stage. Gai Jiaotian also described in detail the learning experiences of his children and their recent situation in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Huang Guiqiu, the pillar of the Tianchan Stage, will perform the play *Zhu Hen Ji*. Yesterday, he ordered the manager Liu Xiaqing to inform the costume department to rush to make four white sheep for the performance. To enhance the spectacle, the stage has issued a notice to the backstage staff not to lift the door curtain or watch the play on stage. Those who violate this rule will be fined one superior-class government office ticket. The Gong Stage authorities hosted a lunch yesterday at the Zhimei Restaurant on Fourth Avenue to entertain the backstage performers with the God of Wealth wine, which ended happily at about one o'clock. Wenwu Laosheng Sun Penglao, after leaving Tianchan, suddenly suffered from a severe throat disease, which nearly brought him to the brink of danger. After being treated by the famous doctor Zhu Ziyun, he has fully recovered. According to Muren, he plans to rest temporarily and not join a troupe. The Great World's Great Peking Opera Troupe has scheduled to rehearse the three-part *Hongbi Yuan* on the eleventh day of the first lunar month, and will continue to perform the second part after the Lantern Festival. The new play *Modern Eight Immortals* by the Lianyou Drama Club, co-written by Chen Dabe and Zhu Yan, is scheduled to premiere on the 25th. Each actor has a heavy role, and a large number of new sets have been added. The plot is especially tortuous and bizarre. The second part is scheduled to follow on the 29th.</p>

<p>Promoting a One-Day Disaster Relief Movement</p>
<p>Shanghai's entertainment world, at the request of the Refugee Relief Association, will carry out a large-scale mobilization from February 21st to 23rd during this former lunar New Year period to broadcast for Shanghai refugees, hoping that citizens can implement a one-day disaster relief movement. This is truly an unprecedented grand event.</p>
<p>During the former lunar New Year, the entertainment industry is running around and busy serving various entertainment venues every day, which is naturally doubly hard work. But they are able to take some time out of their busy schedules to serve the victims, and this spirit is worthy of our admiration. Moreover, when we read the broadcast programs, we feel that this broadcast includes Peking Opera, comedy, Shanghai Opera, ballad singing, storytelling, Siming opera, Siming Xuanjuan, Sutans, stories, singing, opera, ditty, Hangtans, etc., with all kinds of performances available, and entertainment celebrities from all fields personally go on stage to broadcast and sing, which shows their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>No one will deny that the most effective way for entertainment industry employees to use broadcasting to raise funds from audiences from all walks of life. In the past, whether it was a silent gold movement or a disaster relief movement, as long as entertainment industry employees opened their mouths on the radio, a large amount of donations could be raised, not to mention this large-scale broadcast, which also happened to be during the former lunar New Year. Everyone knows that during the New Year, those who don't waste also want to waste, it is the most wasteful season. And when citizens are spending money to their heart's content, the entertainment industry is making a large-scale broadcast, telling the general public that there are still many refugees in Shanghai who are suffering from hunger and cold, hoping that everyone can save at least one day of waste to help the disaster victims, which is like giving a sobering dose to the general public, and the results obtained will naturally be greater than ordinary broadcasts.</p>
<p>Indeed, entertainment without forgetting disaster relief is the responsibility that Shanghai citizens should bear. Saving some entertainment expenses to help disaster victims is the easiest thing to do, and anyone can do it. Therefore, the author deeply hopes that after hearing this broadcast, the general public will be able to implement a one-day disaster relief movement!</p>
<h3 id="e152">Review of "History of Chinese Drama" <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Que</p>
<p>Written by Xu Muyun, published by World Book Company</p>
<p>Chinese drama is entirely an abstract art. Whether it's singing, acting, reciting, fighting, or even a gesture, everything is expressed from an artistic standpoint. Especially with a long history, it can gradually be reformed and become a great achievement in the Eastern art world. (Now, because of the discovery of the reformists and the actors themselves' unwillingness to study deeply, the true art of drama has regressed considerably from its golden age; if the actors do not wake up, I am afraid they will not be able to stand their ground.) We Chinese have such a good art, but our own people only know how to use it for leisure and to entertain their minds. Few people have ever studied it. It is the Europeans and Americans who can recognize the art of Chinese opera, praise it, and study it. This is such a strange phenomenon. Mr. Xu Muyun's research on opera has not been for a short period of time. Because he has gained insight into Chinese opera and is interested in Chinese opera, he usually has particularly many contacts with people in the opera circle, so he also understands everything about opera the most thoroughly. Twenty years ago, Mr. Xu wanted to use his research results to write a "History of Chinese Opera" or some other systematic record. Partly because time did not permit it, and partly because there was a lack of assistants, he was unable to complete this grand wish. Later, when he saw that both the Japanese Utinghua and the British Arlington had such works, although he felt that they had not yet thoroughly studied Chinese opera, and the things they produced were inevitably full of errors and could not satisfy people, he also felt that since Chinese drama occupies such a large value in art, foreigners are still willing to study it and write works about it, why are Chinese people unwilling to study it themselves? Why not promote our great art? After having this feeling, he made a major decision on the writing of "History of Chinese Drama"; but things did not go as planned. Although he had slowly collected all kinds of materials long ago, he still did not achieve this goal for a while. Recently, through his efforts and with the support of Mr. Chu Minyi and others, the entire book has indeed been published. Mr. Xu's brilliant writing is well known to everyone. His profound research on opera is also known to everyone. Those who have read "Secret History of the Palace and Liyuan of the Former Capital" published in this journal can see that in addition to the history of opera, he also knows everything about the small anecdotes of the Liyuan industry in detail, which is truly profound. With his research on Chinese drama and the collection of many years of hard work, the content of this "History of Chinese Drama" is rich and beautiful, which can be imagined. The entire book is divided into five volumes. Volumes one and two describe in detail the history of drama actors in ancient and modern times. It is impossible to write without sufficient materials and textual research. Volume three analyzes the categories of roles and the organization and names of front and back stage costumes. It is not only detailed and well-founded, but also speaks flexibly and clearly arranges things, making it clear to the viewer at a glance. Among them, Volume Four's research on facial makeup and costumes is even more valuable. The text is so euphemistic, plus 53 kinds of extremely valuable color facial makeup and 50 rare color stills, including all kinds of characters on the stage. The name is precious and lovely. Volume Five is biased towards drama research, which is especially helpful for people who study opera. Now that this book is published, I dare say that the opera world will be promoted, and overseas audiences will also be able to add many good impressions. Mr. Xu now has a wish to ask for the support of the authorities to allocate a portion of the Boxer Indemnity to help him translate it into English and French and publicize it abroad. If this matter can be successful, then Chinese opera studies will surely shine in Europe and the United States, and Europeans and Americans will have a better understanding of the truth about Chinese drama. As soon as this book was published, I had already read it. As for how good the content is, you will naturally know after reading it.</p>

<p>Opening Method, Game Sixteen</p>
<p>Black Moves First</p>
<p>Explanation: Reverse Palace Horse Against Center Cannon</p>
<p>Move Sequence Continues from Game Fifteen</p>
<p>Horse Eight Advances to Nine, Change to Knight Four Advances Five, Cannon Six Moves Evenly to Seven, Chariot Three Moves Evenly to Four, Minister Three Advances Five, Horse Eight Advances to Nine, Chariot One Moves Evenly to Two, Chariot Nine Moves Evenly to Eight</p>
<p>(Explanation)</p>
<p>Cannon Eight Moves Evenly to Seven, Seventh Rank Cannon, the meaning is slightly defensive, an extremely stable method in the Center Cannon, with numerous offensive and defensive variations, Horse Eight Advances to Seven, Chariot Two Advances Six were both previously discussed, Chariot Nine Moves Evenly to Eight attacks the chariot with one chariot against two chariot steps without losing initiative (Chariot Two Moves Evenly to Three then advances six again, two steps), Chariot Two Moves Evenly to Three presses the horse, Cannon Six Retreats One to transform the Reverse Palace Horse into a Screen Horse formation, attacking the chariot, preventing the pressed horse, Pawn Seven Advances One, a Seventh Rank Cannon opening that moves the pawn first, if there is no response, it crosses the river, if there is a response, it restricts the horse's path, Chariot Eight Advances Eight, a preemptive method, double block with power, if it moves evenly to two to press the horse, a piece can be gained, if Cannon Six moves evenly to Seven to attack the chariot, the chariot is abandoned, attacking the pawn and elephant gains initiative, stronger than the opponent's Pawn Seven Advance One, Horse Eight Advances to Nine avoids pressed horse, Cannon Six Moves Evenly to Seven attacks the chariot, Cannon Seven Advances Five gains initiative.</p>
<p>Horse Eight Advances to Nine, change to Knight Four Advances Five, Cannon Six Moves Evenly to Seven attacks the chariot, such as Cannon Seven Advances Five to attack the elephant, Cannon Seven can retreat one to attack the chariot, flying the elephant, Minister Three Advances Nine to respond, avoiding Pawn Seven Advances One, Horse Eight Advances to Nine starts the horse to clear the chariot path, Chariot One Moves Evenly to Two moves the chariot out first, Chariot Nine Moves Evenly to Eight also moves out the chariot, all are official moves, after this, they will follow step by step, and must continue their efforts, but in the current situation, both sides are in a stalemate.</p>

<p>— Xu Muxue</p>
<p>Heavenly Thunder Retribution and A Handful of Snow are Both Plays Self-Composed by the Characters</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The grace of giving birth can never be repaid, and the grace of nurturing is as great as heaven," and it is also said, "Poverty produces filial sons, and chaos reveals loyal ministers." Zhang Jibao, having passed the imperial examination as *Zhuangyuan*, should possess this common sense. With his family being so poor, his parents economized on food and clothing, working day and night, and saved money to support him in growing up. He was accustomed to such difficult conditions since childhood. If he had even a sliver of conscience, he would never completely discard the tragic scene he had witnessed with his own eyes for more than ten years as soon as he became an official. Even if he did not want to adopt them, he should at least send them hundreds of taels of silver as compensation for their upbringing over the past decade or so. If not that, he could have built them a thatched cottage and a few acres of meager land, leaving them to support their old age. This could be said to be acceptable. However, there has never been a case where a *Zhuangyuan* forced his adoptive parents to death in front of the pavilion, and the reward was only two hundred copper coins. This not only shows that his heart was as hard as stone and his actions were like those of beasts, but also that he was too stingy and unimaginative. Therefore, such inhumane things would never happen. According to the facts, Zhang Jibao did become an official, but in the past, transportation was inconvenient, and it took time to travel back and forth. Communicating from Beijing to his hometown was even more difficult. By the time Jibao returned after becoming an official, his adoptive parents had both died. Upon hearing the news, he almost fainted from grief, thinking that he had been raised by others since childhood and had gone through all kinds of hardships to grow up. He had originally wanted to achieve fame and return home in glory to repay the kindness of his upbringing, but unexpectedly, before he could repay even an inch of kindness, his parents had both passed away. Therefore, he deeply hated the corrupting influence of fame and success in the imperial examination era. He composed this play himself, meaning that the world values fame and success, and once one becomes a *Zhuangyuan*, even one's parents are no longer wanted. Shouldn't such a person be struck dead by heavenly thunder!"</p>
