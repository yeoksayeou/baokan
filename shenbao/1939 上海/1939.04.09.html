<h3 id="c6">義國為何侵略阿爾巴尼亞 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>當希特勒的東進政策迭有收穫，同時張伯倫領導之下的東歐集體安全組織尙在進行的時候，墨索里尼在涎羨與恐懼二重心理交織之下，又發動了對阿爾巴尼亞的侵略戰爭。上月下旬墨索里尼發表演說辭，已經暗示了對地中海方面的野心，本月初就向阿爾巴尼亞政府提出了長期駐兵和擴充殖民數額的兩項無理要求，並用最後通牒脅迫答覆；阿爾巴尼亞雖然一向是義大利的半附庸國，但這决也覺得有關國家的根本生存，不能容忍此項亡國的要求，就毅然拒絕，並且由國王索古一世發佈準備抵抗的緊急命令；這樣義國的海軍就在本月七日早上開始向阿國的杜拉索和伐洛那等港口進攻，只一日半間，阿國各重要港口悉被佔領，但阿國政府並不稍餒，繼續抗戰，目前戰事正向內地山區展開。</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞日是巴爾幹半島西部的最小國家，面積二萬七千餘方公里，祗及中國江蘇省的四分之一，人口一百萬有零，祗抵到中國的一個南京市；可是她的位置介於希臘和南斯拉夫兩國的中間，扼亞德里亞海的門戶，當中歐南下出海的要衝，所以無論在控制巴爾幹半島或地中海的觀點上，她都是軍略上的要區。義阿兩國相隔不過一衣帶水，而義大利帝國主義發展的方向，在陸爲巴爾幹半島，在海爲地中海，因此阿爾巴尼亞就成爲她侵略的對象。義大利如果把阿爾巴尼亞放在勢力控制之下，不但消極地解除了亞德里亞海對岸的重大威脅，而且可以積極地獲得覇佔地中海和問鼎巴爾幹的重要據點。所以黑索里尼執政以後，對於阿國就抱着無限的野心。一九一六年十一月，義阿兩國簽訂了所謂狄拉那（阿京）條約，翌年同月，兩國又締結了二十年期限的軍事同盟，這樣，阿國在事實上已經是義大利的保護國，不論政治經濟等各部門，都跟義大利發生了密切的關係。義大利旣然在事實上控制了阿爾巴尼亞，爲什麼現在又要勞師動衆，企圖用武力征服阿國呢？據義國官方的自我宣傳，說什麼義國要求阿爾巴尼亞修訂一九二七年軍事同盟條的，阿國發生了反義示威運動，危及義大利僑民的安全。因此義國不得不用武力鎭服，這原是世界侵略者異口同聲的一套侵略理論，毫無置信的價値的。事實上自從波蘭問題發生以後，逼得英法等民治國家走向了集體安全之路，有包圍德義軸心的可能，因此義大利急於跨過亞德里亞海，企圖確實佔領了阿爾巴尼亞，以便在巴爾幹半島橫伸一足，阻止南北間各小邦的聯絡，同時更可以用壓力直接加諸最鄰近的南斯拉夫和希臘兩國，使她們不敢加入東歐集體安全組織。這是墨索里尼的眞實理由之一。再則，義大利所寢食難忘的就是要做地中海的覇主，據倫敦巴黎所傳墨索里尼的計劃，想把地中海的各軍略要點，悉數加以佔領，如英屬直布羅陀，法屬摩洛哥都在覬覦之列，這回的阿爾巴尼亞事件，可以說是義大利對地中海野心的初步發揮。總之，義大利侵略阿爾巴尼亞是義大利對巴爾幹及地中海二重野心的具體表現，也是法西斯陣綫應付民治陣綫縱橫捭闔手段中重要的一着。</p>
<p>然而，事情還不是這樣簡單的。義大利侵略阿爾巴尼亞，恰又暴露了法西斯陣綫自身的矛盾；換句話說，就是德義間的對立，會從此反而尖銳起來。原來義大利一向不恤以巨大代價經營阿爾巴尼亞，其主要目的就在對付南斯拉夫。因爲南斯拉夫沿海的達爾馬地亞一帶地方以及科多海港都是義國所極端垂涎的，所以義國在阿爾巴尼亞有了立脚點，南期拉夫就成爲她的囊中物了。南斯拉夫原日歐戰後最幸運的國家，北方的大部分土地都是奧匈聯邦的舊境；德國最近在中歐勢力大擴張以後，對南斯拉夫大有利用被統治民族問題施展陰謀的可能，甚至在亞德里亞海找一海口也並不是一種空想。德國在巴爾幹的野心，當然對於英法等民治國家是一種威脅，但對於義大利允其是切膚之痛。所以這回義大利侵略阿爾巴尼亞，除了前述目的以外，還有一種微妙的作用，就是企圖加緊對南斯拉夫的控制，使她對任何方面連德國在內，都不許發生連繫關係。傳聞義國曾向南斯拉夫提供保證，卽使德國加以襲擊，義國亦當盡力保障，而以南國對阿爾巴尼亞事件嚴守中立爲交換條件。由此可見德國間自身的矛盾將因阿爾巴尼亞問題而展開了。</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞國軍民目前正在奮力抵抗暴力，不惜流他們的最後一滴血。英法等國雖然目前還沒有積極的表示，但這事件無疑地是集體安全組織能否建立的試金石，我們相信阿國抗戰過程越長久，越能使民治陣綫確實地鞏固起來，那時侵略國家自身的矛盾將相反地繼長增高，結果怕會使她們自享破裂的惡果吧！</p>

<p>日方官員兩度酬酢</p>
<p>克萊琪大使抵滬後、會出寇爾大使邀請華方紳耆虞洽卿·奚玉書·等與克氏敘餐聯觀、一面並會由寇爾大使邀日使館參事森島·日駐滬總領三浦·等與克氏在宴會席上相見、嗣日方外·海·陸·三方面在滬要員、復會同於七日午刻、招待克萊琪大使及寇爾大使、日方參加者、有森島參事·及野村中將·喜多中將·佐藤·櫻井少將·宇都宮中佐·等官員、據悉此次日方官員與克萊琪大使之兩度晤見、系酬酢性質、並未提及任何具體問題、</p>

<p>發表談話謂無任務</p>
<p>英駐日大使克萊琪、昨晨於啟程返日前、對外籍記者發表談話、略謂余乘此假期來滬、拜訪英駐華大使、俾對於吾人共同所注意之問題、彼此交換意見、余久欲於任期內來滬一行、余之前任者、每取道上海赴日、僅有余本人則取道加拿大赴日、因此迄無來滬一行之機會、余此行無政治意義、並無任何任務、與寇爾大使赴渝事、亦無關係、</p>
<p>寇爾赴渝謁各當局</p>
<p>英國駐華大使寇爾爵士、於送別克萊琪大使之後、因尚有關於中英間外交上事務之接洽、爰即於昨（八日）日午後十二時半、搭太原輪赴港、新聲社記者昨探悉寇氏此次行程、預定於抵港之後、即轉輪赴海防、搭滇越鐵路車至昆明、再由昆明搭飛機赴重慶、訪謁中國政府當局、在渝勾留日期、雖未預定、但衆料當在一週左右、再行轉道來滬、</p>
<p>會晤結論殊非泛泛</p>
<p>新聲社記者復據一般熟悉國際情形者告稱、克氏此次來華、與寇爾大使之會見、對於英國在遠東過去今後貿易情勢、曾於接見英國旅滬紳商時深表關切之意、共與寇爾大使之會見衆信當與英國今後對遠東政策、頗有檢討　雖勾留時間、僅三四日、但其結論已獲相當代價、故克氏此行、關係於英國今後遠東問題、當非泛泛、英國政府此時正靜待兩大使會見後之實情報告也、</p>

<p>一般推測意在恫嚇</p>
<p>自上項消息傳出後、一般推測日方或將在短期內向浙東各地採取軍事行動、故空氣似又梢呈緊張、但據關係方面消息、日方此舉顯係含有恫嚇性質、蓋現時各地華軍、巳一致發動總反攻、推進極為順利、日軍頗為恐慌、乃揚言在浙東有所行動、藉示恫嚇、企圖擾亂後方人心、惟衆信此舉斷難收效、因浙東華軍、均已　馬屬兵　枕戈待命、而各地人民、亦同仇敵愾、對日方此舉、決無引起驚惶之理也、</p>

<p>據外商航業界消息、浙東定海洋面、有外輪海龍等九艘、遭日艦扣留檢查、並於昨晨迫駛至吳淞口外停泊、船員及旅客均安、駐滬葡萄牙總領忠準備提出嚴重抗議、美發·棠賽·等輪、原定昨日由滬駛溫、現決暫時停開、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>外輪九艘突遭扣查</p>
<p>浙東航錢、自戰事發生以後、向由英·德·意·葡等各國航商派輪行駛、年餘來相安無事、自海門·鎭海·先後封鎖後、各輪均改駛溫州一綫、以致外輪達十餘艘之多、詛最近定海洋面、突到日艦三艘、於前晨起對所有滬溫綫各輪隻、均實施檢查、前昨兩日、在定海洋面被扣查之外輪、計有（一）葡商大西洋公司之海龍、（二）葡商美利公司之美達、（三）美商華美公司代理之棠魯、以上係於六日由溫駛滬者、（四）美商華美公司代理之棠喬棠貝、係前昨由滬駛溫者、（五）葡商正德公司之利寳、係五日由甬駛定者、（六）尙有柴油夾板船「寳德」·「達瑪」·「米梅」·等、亦係由溫駛滬者、以上共計外輪九艘、均在定海洋面、遭日艦扣留搜查、</p>
<p>昨晨迫駛淞口停泊</p>
<p>各輪自接被搜查消息後、因未續接放行消息、且時間已久、故極爲關懐、即經各該公司分別發電呼呌、但迄未獲回電、蓋各輪之無綫電機、已被日方監視、無法發電報吿、直至前晚八時三十分、美利公司始接美達輪船主電吿、「謂接日本海軍通知駛回上海、約明日（即昨日）可駛抵吳淞」云云、據悉各輪業於昨晨九時許、由日艦監視駛至吳淞口外銅沙洋面停泊、但迄至昨日下午六時止、尙未聞放行消息、</p>
<p>葡領準備嚴重抗議</p>
<p>查以上各輪公司、均係純粹外商資本經營、曾向領事館註册、領有證書、此次突遭日艦扣查、原因殊屬費解、各公司當即據情報吿葡萄牙駐滬總領事署、請求交涉、領署據報後、以情節嚴重、立即向日領提出口頭交涉、但日領則諉稱此係海軍之事、領署未接報吿、故不能表示意見、現葡領決準備提出嚴重抗議、以確保葡商在華之航行權益、</p>
<p>船員旅客均吿平安</p>
<p>自各輪被扣查消息到滬後、一般搭客及船員之家屬、對於安全問題、均關切異常、紛紛向各公司探詢、旋據棠喬輪等電告謂、各輪在淞口外暫怕、船上職員及旅客、均平安、未受任何驚嚇、又悉各輪均裝有太平糧、（按該項糧食、係備在海外遭遇不測時之需、）故船員及旅客之糧食、不致發生間題、且預料經葡領交涉後、各輪均可安然返滬、</p>
<p>美發等輪暫緩開航</p>
<p>美利公司之美發輪·華美公司這棠賽輪、原定昨日由滬啟椗、直放溫州、茲以棠貝·美達·等各輪、突在定海洋面遭日艦扣留搜查、原因不明、且迭經發電呼喊、迄未獲放行消息、故決暫緩開航、俟各輪到滬後、再行集商決定、又葡商正德公司之山泰輪、因未在溫州登記、自甬江封鎖後、即乘機入塢修理、德商遠東公司之哈納輪、亦因整理船身、暫停開航、</p>
<p>飛康等輪安抵温州</p>
<p>德商魯麟洋行之飛康輪，於六日晨由滬駛溫、常日下午四時、駛至定海洋面、突遭日艦開槍三響射擊、幸朱命中、該輪仍繼續開航、並電滬公司報吿、茲該公司昨復接船主克貝去氏電吿、該輪業已平安抵溫、又五日由滬駛溫者、尙有意商華義洋行之寳利輪、茲亦接電吿、謂已平安抵溫、又前日駛溫之意商德平·德商謀福·兩輪均於昨晚先後到達溫州、俟卸裝貨物後、日內即行返滬、</p>
<p>派勒托號被扣不確</p>
<p>又昨晨本市盛傳在浙東洋面被扣查之外輪中、尙有意商CIN標記之巨掄一艘、亦被扣留、經現代社記者查詢後、始知前日駛溫之意商輪除寳利輪巳抵溫外、尙有派勒托號一艘、係駛往福州者、旋據公司方面消息、該輪業已抵達福州、故外傳被扣、實屬不確、</p>
<p>外商集議有效應付</p>
<p>本市葡德等各國船商、以大批輪隻、竟在浙東洋面遭受搜查未釋、而德輪亦遭開槍射擊認爲日方此舉、顯屬故意阻撓各國航運、排擠正當航業、除分別報請駐滬總領事署、提出强硬抗議外、並擬集商有效應付辦法、要求各該國政府、予以確切之保障、</p>

<p>兒童周刑偉人與事業  君朋　　—打破「天才」的遠信—　　諸位小朋友們！也許大家都在想做大偉人或大事業吧！　　我告訴你聽，大偉人或大事業，是人人有資可的。我們切不可迷信「天才」兩字，而有所畏怯，愛迪生說得好：「所謂天才才，真正地說起來，無非是百分之一的靈感，加上百分之九十九的努力的意思。」又說：「所謂天才，就是努力，忍耐與常識。」這幾句話，不是直截爽快地把「天才」打得粉碎嗎？所以我希望你們能夠打破這種惡觀念，而立定志願，做個謀社會國家幸福的大偉人，或做個有利於人類的大事業家。但是，你們必須要自認是個愚笨的人，不可以自命為聰明人，為什麼呢？因為聰明人沒有資格做大偉人或是大事業的，換句話說：「聰明人是不肯努力的，不肯忍耐的，是缺乏常識的。」你可相信嗎？　　我先講愛迪生吧！他是生長在平凡的家庭中，父親是個商業家，母親是個教師，因為他小時候多病，身體不健全，上學很遲，後來到了校中去讀書，成績不好，校長說他是個「低能兒」。但是，他的母親不以為然，就自已來教他，才曉得他的記憶力特強，在這個時候，誰肯相信他會做「發明之王」的科學家呢？英國前首相麥唐納，是個農家的兒子，他當然要幫助父親種田，後來受到環境的壓迫，驅使他到倫敦去出賣勞力，做個堆棧裏的老司務，每星期收入只有十二先令六辦士，生活是如何的困難，後來才由做工而新聞記者，而升到工黨的領袖，再因工黨的組閣，就被任為英國首相了。士耳其總統凱末爾，他是一個在薩羅尼加稅關上的下級官吏的兒子，後來因為父親死了。於是他在親戚家中，做過牧童，那裏會知道在士耳其光榮史上有這個大人物呢？外國的大偉人不去多講，單以孫中山先生而論，他是個廣東香山縣（今改名中同縣是經念他的意思）翠亨村上的農家的兒子，起初還昌一個替人家看病的醫生，有什麼希罕，誰會知道他是世界上的革命偉人，是中華民國的國父呢？大偉人或大科學家是沒有什麼「超人」的本領—天才。　　小朋友呀！我們要做大事、萬不可做大官、偉人名哲都在平民隊裏、所以你們不要自暴自棄、趕快努力做去、必須記牢努力，忍耐與常識三個要件，我相信你們一定會成功，將來的大事業，都在諸位小朋友的肩上。中美兩國小朋友聯袂遊記  新生　　最近，中美兩邦，國際關係日益深密，他那種種友好的表示，即是美國人民漸漸了解我們的明證！我們且不談已往或目下他對付我們的政策是不是託定的？總之：他近來的對待我們，在事實上已是大大地改正了！　　在兒童節的那一天，有一位美國小朋友，邀那正在太平洋公園裏遊玩的華兒，到美國去玩，先乘了中國飛剪號到舊金山，華兒在上空看到了那座金門大橋（1）非常快樂；由舊金山先到松林公園去看千年老松，（2）再到好萊塢（3）去參觀攝製電影；然後乘火車到紐奧來斯，（5）沿途看到許多牛，羊，牧場；（4）在（5）華兒看到許多的漁輪（25）和著名的大蝦（23）鯖　（24）等；由（5）經密西西比河（6）北上，沿途看到許多農場（7）和用外車輪行駛的舊式汽船（8），到了聖路易（9）換乘用太平洋式車頭拖帶的列車（10）至監河城，轉乘汽車經過那多火石溶岩的荒涼地區，（11）這兒的山石，形狀怪特，動物衹有野兔（12）等；到了黃石色的，加以青翠的草木，和奔馳成　的糜鹿（14）景色很是秀麗。後來他們再坐流綫型的快車（15）到支加哥（16）那兒不單是鐵路匯集的中心，且是世界第一大湖港，由（16）坐汽船繞了全球聞名的大湖（17）遊覧一圈而至電曲樂（18）那是製造汽車的工業地，由（18）乘汽車到尼加拉（19）看世界第一大瀑布後，經礦場，工業地帶（28）而至紐約，（20），這是世界第一大都市，高樓林立，人口千萬，港口有手舉火絕地通過其下（22）；自紐約經水道至華盛頓（26），華兒看到那著名的白宮與高聳雲霄的華盛頓紀念塔。由（26）乘了飛機（27）橫越大陸至舊金山，再改坐飛艇（29）渡太平洋返國。　　臨行，美國小朋友告華兒道：「我國在創立時，起初也是很弱的，後經不斷的努力苦幹，始有今日的強盛，希望貴國在不久的將來，也能像我們的一樣富強！」　　華兒說：「謝謝你們的好意，我國的小朋友一定不會負你的雅望的，因為我們都是復興中華的生力軍呀！」說時，那飛剪號剛飛過一艘泊在太平洋上的巡洋艦與一艘破浪西駛的商船（30），在白雲與碧海之中作萬里的長征！　　（上星期兒童節特刊中，因稿擠未克將此文刊出，而圖已見報，殊為抱憾，茲將圖文一並付刊，請注意）（圖在下面）新時代的兒童  樂觀　　兒童，兒童　　我們，我們是中華民國的主人翁。　　品行端正，　　讀書用功，　　力求上進不放鬆，　　鍛煉身體，　　注意運動，　　將來報國立大功！　　兒童，兒童！　　我們，我們是二十世紀的新兒童。　　研究科學，　　提倡勞動，　　結成團體愛大衆。　　作息相偕，　　患難相共，　　改造世界志願宏。　　兒童，兒童！　　我們，我們是救國的急先鋒。　　節約救難，　　宣傳鼓動，　　力量雖小志氣宏。　　打退敵寇，　　撲滅奸兇，　　共謀祖國的光榮！　　（本文歡迎製譜）難童的兒童節（下）  伯吹　　「現在只剩她一個人了，她常常哭着……」　　一喂，小华！别哭了，醒醒吧，今天是「兒童節。」　　小華給她的好朋友光中喊醒了，眼睛裏還滿是眼淚，呆呆的坐在草舖上，老不做聲。　　光中催着她說，「不是嗎？昨天先生告訴我們今天是兒童節，八點鐘就要開會，開過會還要　我們出去參觀。你不趕緊起來嗎？」　　小華望望照進窗子來的陽胸，時候真的不早，趕忙起身。她一邊洗臉，一邊想着兩年前在鄉下陳村小學裏的兒童節。　　　八點鐘到了，小華和光中跑到門外去開會，外面站滿了逃難的小朋友，以前是全不認識的，現在都變做好朋友了。他们很亲爱，为了他们自已都逃过難，都知道各人是怎样从飛機的轟炸掃射下面逃出來的。　　開會了，教他們書的先生來了，還到了凡位陌生的先生，他們講的話，都是好話，說他們怎樣不幸，怎樣會弄到這般地步，要他們怎樣奮發起來！……他們一句句聽着，特別是小華記得更牢，「這不就是夢裏的事情嗎？」她想。　　這一天，他們跑了不少路，參觀了好幾個地方。　　馬路上只是擠來擠去的人，來來往往的車子，各式各樣的店舖，……小華也無心觀看。後來他們被領到一所很高的房子的屋頂上，大家在上面望望　　上海是整天給烟霧籠罩著，像魚的鱗樣地屋子，望不盡的，也有幾座屋子，像山峯樣地高高聳起來，還有不少的烟囪，吐著黑烟，像巨人在吸著搖烟樣地，一響喧鬧的聲音，從四面八方傳過來，……　　大家在屋頂上望了九久，對著這烟霧迷漫的上海，沒有什麼趣味，反而引起了他們想家的念頭來了。　　小化和他們一樣　　跑了一天，看是看了不少，卻沒有看到什麼。每一個孩子，拖著一個疲倦的身子，一顆思鄉的心，回到他的陰闡的難民收容所去。　　光中獨個兒自言自語的說，「上海，上海有什麼—車子，店舖，烟囪，喧鬧……啊！我們要回家去！—打回老家去！」　　小華坐在她的鋪上，不做聲，心裏在想，「爸—媽—小弟弟—燒掉了的屋子—一隻大黑水牛—爸堆起來的一包包棉花—媽織的一匹匹布—米呀，豆呀！……」　　淡黃的陽光，斜上屋角，屋子裏漸漸的黑起來。　　難民收容所裏的難童的兒童節，就這樣過去了。小朋友的小園地現在的上海  阜春小學六年級生　王獻嘉　　現在的上海，真可說是畸形發達的不夜城了，各種酒館，戲院，都接　的開起來，把整個的上海變成神秘區了，所有的居民都搬入租界，所以生活費，每日在增高。昔日的南市閘北呢？已成一片焦土，言之痛心。所以我們住在上海，不是好像籠中鳥一般嗎？　　我們回憶到以前，上海是我國最繁盛的商埠。並且靠長江入海處，是我國水陸交通的中心。商業發達，工廠林立。每年留易總額，要佔全國一半。現在呢？不要說工商業發達吧！一切的主權，我國已絕無僅有，形成了一個喧賓奪主的樣子。若大的上海達到如此的境地，應該婦罪於誰啊！　　我希望一般青年人，不要再醉生夢死，沉沒在孤島上。應該要認清中華民國的危機，你們是現在中國的主人翁，祖國是很爭迫地需要你們圖強，需要你們來醫治歷年所受的創傷。但是我們一般小朋友呢？不要以為自已年幼，而對祖國不能效勞，我們應該努力讀書，鼓勵我們青年奮勇前進，來復興我們的民族。春夜的一個夢  光明小學五年級生　王根清　　光陰如流水般不知不覺過去，寒酷的冬天已去遠，可愛而溫暖的春天又來了，所有的枯樹都萌發新芽，百花盛開，還有那黃鶯在枝頭歌迎春的歌曲；小朋友們都面帶笑容，活潑潑地跳躍着，我也是其中的一份子，在美麗生動的情景中，踏着柔滑，近邊流水很有節奏的激盪着，十分動聽，這真是一個快樂的世界呀！所有的花草和各種的小動物以及飛禽，好似早已在等待着春之神的來臨。　　我們中國和日本開戰，那已夫去的土地，正等待將士們的犧牲和肉博，交換最後的勝利，恢復一切的失地，我躺在青地上，忽被蟲兒咬了一口，便驚醒了，卻原來是一個夢。鐘的自述  新生小學五年級生　閻啟泰　　我本是一塊鐵，後來不知誰把我改造了，便成了一個奇異的東西，把我放在一家店裏，那裏邊有許多同伴，一天我正和同伙們「的達」，「的達」，談天的時候，忽來了一個人，給了主人幾張方紙，和幾個銀色的東西，看了一會，把我帶走了，我在離別的時候，真有依依不捨的樣子，從那天起，便脫離了我那可愛的同伴，換了一位新主人，那人把我帶回去，天天依從我，每天早晨我「噹」「噹」的呌了六下，他便很快的穿了衣服，吃了早飯辦公去了。　　我的用處很大，我有個特性，便是一天到晚，要「的達」「的達」的呌著，小學生也要用我，譬如他早上起身，也依從我；上學去聽從我；放學回家也要聽從我；我有個弟弟，名呌「錶」，他因為比我霖便活潑，不像我這般粗笨，所以一般人都把我的弟弟在手腕上，我的名字，你們知道嗎？我的名字呌「鐘」。蜜蜂來了  上海小學六年級生楊聖　　吃到甜甜的蜜糖時，總使我掛念着蜜蜂。現在，春天到了，花都開了，蜜蜂又出來勤勤地工作啦！　　蜜峰的身體很小，但是他們很團結，並且做起事來，很肯耐苦，我們雖然體格很大，但是卻不肯團結，並且極懶惰，比起他們來，真是慚愧啊！　　蜜蜂告訴我們：「只有勤工作才有甜的蜜糖吃，只有用刺來保衛自已才不會被人家奪去蜜糖。　　小朋友們！蜜蜂又在勤勤地工作了，我們快效法它吧。十歲小朋友奚慶榮君的字  奚慶榮參觀  力特　　「喂請開門！」「誰？」　　「黃振中！陸志達！」　　「噢，原來是你倆。好早，現在剛才七點鐘呢！你們已經吃過早點，預備到學校裏去嗎？」　　「是。李永文，快些吃早點。昨天劉老師說，今天八點鐘就要集合出發，去參觀鄭童學校呢。」　　「李永文，你的肚子不餓嗎？」黃振中問。　　「不打緊，我的袋子裏有錢。昨天晚上，我的媽給了我兩塊錢，她說今天是兒童節，給我看電影玩耍的。肚子餓，可以買點心吃。」　　「我的媽昨天也給了我一塊半錢。」黃振中跳躍着說，手插在衣袋裏。　　「今天下午，我請你倆看電影。」李永文說。　　「別客氣，我來請你們。」黃振中說。　　「大家都不要客氣，我們三個人各拿出一塊錢來用。難得今天是兒童節，我們快樂一下。」陸志達調解似地發表主張。　　「是！是！今天兒童節，我們得快樂一下。」李和黃附和。　　黑色的帽子，黃色的皮鞋，薄呢的大衣，三個小朋友並着肩，步伐整齊地沿着馬路旁的人行道，向學校走去。　　難童學校的竹籬門上，交又着黨國旗。青天，白日，滿地紅，充分表現着光明，活力和希望。　　劉老師率領着四十個小朋友，從難童學校大門進去。難童學校正在舉行升旗禮，大家立正，唱黨歌。　　四百多個難童看見四十個陌生的小朋友來參觀，當然感到有些奇異，每副眼睛，注視着。四十個小朋友也是如此。　　「他們都是新衣服，慶祝兒童節！」難童們不免在這樣想。　　「咦，他們的衣服，都是破爛不堪！」四十個小朋友也不免在這樣想。　　難童們開始慶祝兒童節，有唱歌，演說，雙簧，劇本等等。雖然沒有什麼佈景，沒有什麼服裝，可是都很精采。他們怎麼變成難童，以及難童生活的痛苦，也都表現出來了。四十位小朋友看了，才知道難童們以前都是很快樂很活潑的。不料敵人把他們的家毀了，使他們流落成難童。　　李永文被推做代表，向難童們表示謝意。李永文平常很會講話，在全校演說競賽會裏，曾連得三次第一。但是他今天走上了台，竟一句話也說不出。他看着站在台下的四百多位難童，穿着破爛的衣裳，不禁眼淚撲簌撲簌地落下來，喉嚨裏好像有個軟木塞哽住。他自已覺得慚愧，他穿了這麼好；他自已責備自已，平日吃着都要講究舒適，好像自已不是國難下的中國人。但是他想到敵人的罪惡，他把牙齒一咬，鼓着勇氣，好像瀑布似地，氫敵人的罪惡數說了一遍。他說明大家的責任和出路只有：「有錢的出錢，有力的出力，」「保衛祖國。」　　平日，羔羊似的李永文，今天居然好像一只小獅子，怒吼着。這樣的突變，不消說全級的同學都驚異，就是劉老師也驚異。　　四十位小朋友，參觀難童學校的內部；一根竹竿橫着做櫈，幾塊竹板拼起來做課桌，泥土地凹凹凸凸的。據說難童們不能整天上學，有許多難童，每天要出去賣報，人家婚喪時候去鼓着吹奏湊熱鬧，或者做些別的小本生意，設法賺幾個錢餬口並幫助一家的生活費。　　「我們應該幫助他們！」李永文向劉老師和全級同學提議。　　「是的！是的！」黃振中陸志達首先附合。劉老師和其餘的同學當然也十二萬分贊成。　　李永文把預備下午看電影玩耍的兩塊錢第一個捐出來。黃振中陸志達也各把有的一塊半錢捐出來。其餘的同學都踴躍捐錢，多少不一。所捐的錢，一齊交給劉老師，請她當面交給難童學校的主持人。　　正午十二點鐘，李永文回到家裏吃午飯，覺得青菜，豆腐特別有滋味，好像從來沒有發見過。他的媽問他能觀的經過，他一五一十地報告。　　「難童們實在可憐，中國人只有團結抵抗，才有生路！」媽媽堅決地說　　李永文沒有說什麼，只是在想：「這時候，難童們不知有什麼東西吃。」　　「永文，快些吃吧，你今天下午不預備出去看電影玩耍媽？」　　「媽，我的錢都捐了，我心裏覺得比看電影玩耍更愉快。」白雪公主（十三）  天孫　　白雪公主正在忙着，並沒有留心到那些小動物們，已在一雯時間亂紛紛地跑到門外去了。伊也並沒有瞧見王後已偷偷地溜將上來，探頭探腦的向着窗子裏張望。　　當伊正把那最後的一個包子從爐子裏拿出來時，覺得房間裏忽然地暗了起來，好像太陽突被黑雲遮住了的一般。白雪公主抬頭一看，不由得打了一個寒噤。原來見那王后已傴腰曲背地立在那敞開着窗外，身上穿著一件賣雜貨的破衣服，活像一個女巫橫樣，鼻子是長長的，背心弓起着，似是駱駝背上的駝峯。　　伊帶着笑對白雪公主說道：「親愛的，你不要怕。我不過是一個可憐的賣雜貨老婆子，辛苦奔跑了一天，實在太疲乏了。可能許我進門來休息麼？」　　白雪公主聽了這話，正在猶豫着，驀地裏卻想起了矮人們的警告，便疾忙答道：「對不起得很，我不能請你進來，因為！」　　王后不等伊說完，忙不迭的打斷了伊的話頭，搖着頭歏了口氣道：「真是不巧得很，那些矮人們怎麼偏偏不在家！你瞧，我有很好的蘋果在這裏，預備給他拉吃的。」把一個鮮給可愛的蘋果，遷給白雪公主瞧，原來就是那隻特製的毒果！　　王后又接下去說道：「你倘把我這裏的蘋果來做蘋果餅，那是多麼的好啊！親愛的，你不妨拿這一個來做樣品，咬一口試試它的味兒，到底好也不好？」　　白雪公主瞧那蘋果時，當真是給灼灼的，鮮艷欲滴，伊不知不覺地伸出手來，想去接受那隻蘋果。這時那些小鳥們正在靠近窗外的樹上飛來飛去，立刻飛將下來，惡狠狠地向着王后手上亂啄，把那毒蘋果啄脫了手，撲的掉落在地。　　聰明的王后瞧了這情形，知道那女孩子畢竟是個小孩子，已着了伊的道兒，對伊有了同情心了。當下伊即忙從地下拾起那寶貴的母蘋果來，藏在披肩下面，一面捧着自已的心，假做要暈過去的樣子。　　王后心想：想下毒手，總得先走進了這屋子才好辦，於是又裝出一副很痛苦的神情來，不住的呻吟着道：「唷唷唷，難受得很！請你快快給我喝一口水吧」。　　白雪公主一片天真，那裏知道王后的陰險，就不知不覺地落到伊的陷阱中去了。伊扶着王后的臂兒，走進了小屋子，預備好好的安慰伊一番。任是那些小島兒接接查查地亂呌着警告伊，伊也置之不理，一到裏面，立刻關上了門，又怕小鳥們再來麻煩，案性把窗子閉了。　　這時那些小鳥兒情不不妙，便好像發了瘋一樣，它們在窗外門外亂飛亂呌了一會，見沒有什麼用，要救公主委實也無從救起，於是成羣結隊的向着七個矮人工作的鎮裏飛去。那些四足動物們，也似乎明白了情勢嚴重，非趕快出動不可，因便跟着小鳥飛去的方向，急急忙忙地趕去。這許多的走的聰明的小動物，只有一個共同的思想，就是它們必須飛快的穿過森林，找到了七矮人，帶他們趕回來搭救白雪公主。</p>

<p>春秋「游擊隊的母親」　趙老太太在重慶  味辛　　（重慶航信）以五十八歲的高齡，從九一八以來，七年中沒有休息過一天，不斷地在敵人後方宣傳募捐，運械，這就是我們今天要說的「游擊隊的母親」趙老太太——趙洪文國。　　剛歡迎過她的兒子—趙侗，現在她老人家自己也來了；重慶的民衆是够興奮的。　　趙老太太過去七年中的奮鬥歷史，從她自己的口中，這樣報吿過：　　『我是一個沒有念過書的老太婆，民國二十年東北被强佔後，××强盜到處燒殺搶掠，我們東北人民會等死嗎？不！東北各地無數的靑年學生組織了義勇軍打××，敵人老是說中國是一盤散沙，沒有團結；但現在我們是凝結的鋼，不再是散沙。當時，趙侗的同學來跟我說：「老太太，請你把兒子和財產捐給我們義勇軍，我們一定不讓你的兒子犧牲，留着他來孝敬你……」救中國，打××我是很贊成的。太太們養了兒子，愛護他，敎育他，一到年老，今天喝茶，明天吃飯，這就算孝敬嗎？所以，當時我除把所有的財產捐給義勇軍外，我們一家也全都加入義勇軍了。　　『游擊隊開始自已買槍買子彈，人數一天天增多，力量一天天加强……』　　是的，建老太太和他的兒子侗，女兒理仁，理勇，理智，最小的兒子連中都加人了游擊隊。在北平淪陷前後，連那十四歲的理智也立下了不少功勞，在她那書包中，從北半城中，不知帶出了多少槍械子彈。　　『東北雖然丟了七年多，東北同胞不願做亡國奴的，都起來了。敵人沒有把東北每個地方佔領，祇是佔了「點」，而且常給游擊隊破壞交通，一隊一隊的消滅。靑天白日旗還飄揚在游擊隊中，時時高呼「打倒××帝國主義」的口號。華北更大部份是游擊隊的天下』。　　去年她們從黃河北岸的游擊區裏出來，到了漢口，理仁，理智轉湘入國立東北中畢讀書，老太太自己到了廣州，又到海外向僑胞宣傳。　　她叙述當時的情形道：『很多的僑胞到碼頭上歡迎我，我不是有地位的夫人，我不過帶了東北，華北抗戰的消息報吿僑胞，我吿訴他們：我們的領袖堅持抗戰，游擊隊堅持抗戰。全國軍民一致堅持抗戰，中國抗戰有十二分把握，勝利一定是我們的。僑胞們在道緊急的時候，需要有錢的出錢，有力的出力，有知識的出知識。願爲國奮鬥的可歸國參加正規軍或游擊隊，他們聽了我的演講，不斷地給婦女慰勞總會滙錢。許多靑年婦女當衆要求跟我回國打游擊，只因爲我今後的工作沒有一定，只好使他們失望得哭泣起來。』　　她這次遠涉重洋宣傳，歷時五月多，最近由安南返國，在昆明住了六天，也作了九次演講，二月十日由飛機飛到重慶。在她到了以後的五六天裏，已用她那淸楚響亮的口音，向市民作了三次長時間的演講。誰說她是個平凡的老太婆呢！在實際行動中，她已經鍜鍊成意志特別堅强，認識特別正確的全中國數一數二的婦女領袖。　　黑帽，黑衣，黑鞋，黑大衣，是她的服裝。一根手杖僅僅作爲她這檬年齡的老婦的點綴品，步履矯健，坐飛機不覺得暈。演講一二小時不乏，不啞，來了還要領導聽衆高呼口號。　　這樣鮮健的身體，這樣頑强的精神，正象徵着我們有悠久歷史的中華民族，因抗戰而蓬勃着少年的朝氣，天天向新生之路邁進。　　她和她的兒子趙侗，不久要回到華北去打游擊。也許她再到星加坡去宣傳。這要看當局的命令。是的，她不是到重慶來享福的，像那些穿高跟鞋燙飛機頭的太太們一樣。被調郵員吿別上海書　　上海，偉大的上海，你是工商業的中心，你是文化界的薈萃，不論村夫愚婦，文人墨客，軍人政僚，以及歐美人士，莫不景仰瞻望，所以你的威名，冠天下而甲全國，誰個不知？那個不曉？　　但是你可曾知道，你現在完全喪失了你的精神，失去了你的價値。你所有的，不過一個軀殼，不過一個空的軀殼，不過一個臭的軀殼。在你的軀殼四周，圍滿了豺狼虎豹，毒蛇猛獸。在你軀殼底下，籠照着許多醉生夢死的靑年，花天酒地的舞客，吃喝嫖賭的富人，在他們心裏，除了娛樂之外，不知甚麽是國事，甚麽農民族。在你軀殼之下，同時又藏着　　喪心的漢奸，病狂的走狗，失去良心的賣國賊，在這樣混濁情形之下，我們不能不離開上海。以地講，我們是離開黑暗的地獄，走向光明的大道，以時講，我們是離開落伍的塲所，走到有爲的羣中，以良心講，我們是不忍看見這般醉生夢死，喪心病在的人們，以責任講，我們是本着國家興亡，匹夫有責的敎訓，離開上海，出征前方，爲國服務。在這種情形之下，我們又不能不吿別上海，在我們未走之前，我們還要講的：就是不得最後勝利之時，永遠不回上海。在我們旣走之後，我們希望郵界同志，踴躍前往，同時並希望工商學各界有爲的靑年，都能走到前方同時服務，取得最後勝利，回到上海，痛飲三杯，別矣上海。「金山漁歌」觀感  如華　　“Fisherman’s　Wharf”　　我喜歡寳貝白玲；更喜歡「金山漁歌」。在好萊塢人才輩出的童星中，我之私好寳貝白玲，正如我厭惡秀蘭鄧波兒和金蕙漱一樣，不免是個人的偏見；但到現在還有「喜歡」羅克者，則我的「偏見」，尙不致於成爲「罪惡」吧？而事實上寳貝白玲自「梨園思子」「虹影花聲」以來，他的每一部作品和秀蘭鄧波兒及金蕙漱的比較起來，總是略勝一籌吧？　然這兩位被我厭惡的小姑娘所以弄成那樣的「裝腔作勢」，決不是出於自願，可是好萊塢的製作人却正以此自傲哩，於是，我不得不「偏見」了。　　「金山漁歌」是以舊金山的漁人生活爲背景的，但它並不像蔡楚生的「漁光曲」那樣正面地去寫漁人生活及其他，它的以漁人生活爲背景眞祗是背景而已，主要的關鍵自然還繫在寳貝白玲身上。我的喜歡「金山漁歌」，在它並不以故事去遷就主演者，而把他溶化在故事之中。更可愛的，「金山漁歌」從紫樸的描寫中强示了人類偉大的愛：漁人的合羣；賓主的如同家人；卡勞的舐犢悄深；以及畢甫和安琪連娜的結合，導演者都能以深入淺出的手法，感激人心。所以，恕我下個不適當的譬喻，「金山漁歌」是一首淸麗的散文，導演者也確是個白描聖手。　　如本片一開塲的描寫漁人生活，在落日斜照，波光浮映的情境中，一艘艘漁船飄然歸來，有的在船首上結網，有的在奏琴取樂，寳貝白玲的歌聲就像一串銀鈴那樣飄過碧空，飄過海面，飄過每個漁人的耳畔，於是，他們酬唱着，一股共同生活的熱情洋溢在畫面上，送着落日下海。又如卡勞妻妹史蒂拉及其子魯道夫的加入，破壊了這融洽的家庭，當湯尼（寳貝白玲）因細故被父親實駡之後，他偕着他伴侶海狗呆坐在月光之下，而卡勞突來勸他入寢；及湯尼和魯道史毆打之後，他離家出走，卡勞到海面上去追他回來，兩人在船上的對訴，導演者都用着輕描淡寫的手法寫着父子天性的流露，眞是可愛極了。　　其他對於人物個性的把握及情感氣氛的抓取也都有力的。如里沃未利魯的卡勞，他帶着濁音的對白，率直熱忱的性格，一如活生生的從銀幕上跳下來，自然里沃卡利魯的演技也値得推崇的。亨利亞米泰的畢甫，和羅賽娜茄麗的安琪連娜，他們多言，帶着點傻性的爽直，也都親切可愛。　　畢甫和安琪連娜結婚的那塲戲，在情感氣氛上是本片中最好的一塲戲。他先寫兩個孩子在前，安琪連娜微笑着進來，畢甫則彷彿有點不知所措的樣子。寳貝白玲唱着聖歌的時候，這對老夫婦都作着會心的微笑，但同時卡勞和史蒂拉也情不自禁地緊握着手，這在寳貝白玲看來，他是感到非常痛苦的。導演者在這塲戲中，把每個人的情緒都像解剖似的呈現在觀衆之前，使人喜悅，使人感動，使人同情。　　寳貝白玲一共唱了四支歌。在漁船歸來時唱的一支，在畢甫夫婦軍歸與卡勞合作時覆唱了一次。在敎堂中唱了聖歌。其他兩支，一是在史蒂拉來的時候，卡勞舉行慶祝，一是和實伴們合唱的，在這二支歌唱的時候，我們知道導演者對於熱鬧塲面的處理同樣是擅長的。　　我喜觀寳貝白玲；更喜觀「金山漁歌」，不過不免是個人的「偏見」。木蘭從軍  陳禾製　　唧唧復唧唧　木蘭當戶織　不聞機杼聲　惟聞女歎息雨過天青  包天笑　　第七回　乳燕新鶯影聯雙璧。越羅吳錦機織七襄　　何雙玉笑道：『你且慢着！我們也是初次辦事，安能誇下大口，說我們　織物出品，一定能風行海外呢？我們現在先把計畫書草就，開辦費要若干，流動資本要若干。或再定一筆預備流動資本要若干，這筆費用，暫時不動，到了我們貨品暢銷，資金周轉不敷的時候，再行動用。其實要是我們貨品暢行到海外時，國內的金融界都願意放款給我們了』。何儷玉道：『這個廠若是辦成了，最好我們兩人都不要當經理。經理請父親那邊的股東中，舉出一個人來，我和你都當工程師。我們第一要計畫出種種新發明，織物的爲用，全是服裝上，而服裝以美爲主，又要新頴，要常常的想出新花樣來。不是父親的信上說：從前我們的絲織物，墨守成法，就是不能有什麽新花樣。法國的絲織物，質料未必比我們的勝，但是他們花樣新鮮，顏色漂亮，就勝過我們了。日本的織物，質料更劣，遠不及我們，但他們在市塲上，可以打擊我們，也爲的他們有新花樣。所以我們兩人中，有一人，要常在國外調查。譬如外國婦女界，喜歡那一種貨品，我們務必投其所好。我們兩人，一個在國內，一個就在國外，輪流掉換，要是這樣，必然能操勝算」。何雙玉又笑道：『好了！這樣企畫起來，也不是我們幾天功夫可以想得着的。我們現在只有逐步進行，一面草計畫，一面覔地方。而且忙不在一時的，覔地方事，總要請愛人帮忙。或者愛人不熟悉，就請愛人的祖老太爺帮忙，也說不定咧。我們本來爲了別墅的事，也要到了自由村去，再想法子。現在要建築廠房，把別墅的事，也可以一齊解決了』。何儷玉道：「不差！我們若要建築別墅，一定要和織物用的廠址相近，可以就近照料。好比現在章醫師這個住它，也必定和她的醫院與育嬰院相近，就是這個道理。而且我們要是造廠屋，別墅，建筑師也已有了人呀」！何雙玉呆了一呆道：『怎麽說趙築師已有了人，却是誰呀」？何儷玉道：『金澹雲的未婚夫林建成，不是當建築師的嗎？我們雖不是決定請他，我們不妨來一個假定呢』。（八二）</p>

<p>游藝界銀城風雨錄  銀箏　　新華廠屋遷讓交涉　　新華公司製片廠，去秋遷設海格路—香花園，內部地位實大，且具園林花木之勝。用以攝製外景，允復極感便利。彼時於業主方面訂的承租，原屬長期性質；新華且早準備起建大攝影塲，作爲基本的陣營。近時業主徐某遽作別圖，忽將該處全部地產出售於人，代價計達三百萬元之鉅。爲此產權易主，續租未能，徐某遂非要求新華遷讓不可。關於此項損失，徐某以責任所在，願償新華五萬金毀的了事，而新華於實際上所受損失，計須近十萬元：以是彼此差數過鉅，不易解決；設如爭持不下，或將發生訟事。　　滬光米高梅起糾紛　　滬光戲院映片方針，原定以二輪西片爲主，首輸國片爲輔。在前早與米高梅公司訂定長的，承映全部出品。近爲滬光首映華成公司「木蘭從軍」營業鼎盛，開業至今，延久未停。米高梅因此積滯多片，不獲開映，致向該院提起交涉，發生嚴重糾紛。滬光於　木蘭從軍」片，現仍售座不衰，旣屬不欲輕易捨棄；華成方面允復未許貿然輟映。米高梅此一爭端，遂至瀕於決裂，幾使滬光難以顧全。嗣向米高梅再三疏釋，允將原定緊接「木蘭從軍」後之華成第二片「雲裳仙子」映期延緩，改由該公司西片提前排映一月。米高梅始爲態度緩和，糾紛暫吿牛息。　　三方競租夏令配克　　夏令配克爲滬上創建最早之唯一電影院。計時在一九一四年間，至今已歷二十六載。在早年時期，原是盛極一時的最摩登的娛樂塲合。後來爲有很多新姿態的戲院紛紛建築起來，漸决受及時代淘汰，不免歸於落伍；近年蛛網塵封，停閉已久；戰起後廢物利用，闢爲難民收容所，現在仍有不少難胞困居在內。孤島娛樂事業現於畸形發展的情狀之下，因有黃某其人於兩月前斥資二千金租定該院，謀使復業。旋爲格於房屋年久失修，據工部局派員測騐，非將屋頂拆卸重建不可。此項修理費，佔計的須三萬餘元；因此躊躇迄今，未能舉辦；近時遂有共他方面起與競租該院，形成三角之爭。頃聞方有魯仲連出任調解；大致將由黃某牧回若干費用，移歸柳某接辦。而在此數月期內，也就快將更多一家戲院了！宋雅海妮改變作風  淡雲　　美國影片企業高的生意眼無孔不入，曾有許多著名的運動家如游泳家拳擊家等等都被羅致了去，而比較最近的一個便是宋雅海妮。宋雅因爲精於溜冰術，比其他的溜冰女子來得純熟和美妙，因此引起好萊塢的注意。影片商便開始討論了，說有這末一個女郞，溜冰術超羣頗負聲名，千萬人都渴望着看她在冰上的表演呢。本來普通的運動攝上一木五六分鐘便映畢的新聞片也就够了，然而對於宋雅却不然，可以聘她攝製長片呢。於是決定把她聘了去。　　宋雅雖沒有演技的經騐，但影片商的生意眼却不在她的演技上，所注重的只是她的溜冰術。因之宋雅在經過有限的表演指導後，便開始拍片了；當然注重的都在她的溜冰術上·宋雅的溜冰術確乎是姿勢美妙，動作純熟；加以攝影技術的運用，似乎是很能哄動觀衆。於是接一連二的攝下去，「鳳舞銀冰一，「銀宮歡舞」等等，共攝　過四部影片。沒有一部脫離過「舞」的，然而她的有限的演技，並沒有進步，觀衆們看來看去老是這一套，以同一個女郞，表演差不多的溜冰技術，未免使他們提不起興趣來。　　聘請宋雅的製片商尚尼克，也感覺到觀衆們的意向，知道長此以往，她勢必和以前上銀幕後不久即號召不起的許多運動明星落入同樣的命運，於是試圖把她由溜冰家而變爲女演員。但是，這問題不很容易解決的，因爲宋雅的演技和經騐都比較淺薄。現在富有經騐的劇作家正在編製適合她表演的劇本，一方面，宋雅也在努力學習一個女演員應具的演技。當然宋雅的新戲裏不致完全沒有她的溜冰表演，但是已把溜冰放在决要的地位，只偶而表演幾塲，主要的是把演技來博取觀衆的同情。　　宋雅在新片裹，將以新的姿態演出，一般人都相信她將勉力工作，一定還能度着悠久的影星生涯，不致和其他運動明星般的曇花一現，就銷聲匿跡。比翼雙飛  基　　在銀壇下的影迷們，大該總不會忘記那一對歌國裏的帝后，珍妮麥唐納和奈爾遜埃第。歷年來的偉大歌舞劇都引得每一個人如醉如狂，戲院門前，車水馬龍。這種盛况就可見到那兩位號召力的偉大。而事實上，他們的作品也一部比一部優越，不論情節，佈景，歌唱，以及表情都足當美麗兩字。　　在過去，他們的作品，都是古裝，所用的色彩是單純的黑白的，（除了「桃花恨」的一幕粉紅色場面），但是在最近的比龔雙飛一却有了驚人的改革。他們穿的是最漂亮的時裝，尤以珍妮麥唐納的幾幕時裝展覽，式樣新頴，色彩和諧。幾件大衣，沒有一件不是別出心裁，無論中西裝都是很適宜的。本片的色彩是不可多見的；普通的天然色彩影片都是露天的。秀麗的山水，鮮艷的花草，本能地，就顯出了美麗的色彩。但是，在「比翼雙飛化裏的塲面都是室內的，在這特殊的情况下，那鮮妍的色彩就靠那美麓的服裝和悅目的佈景了。無論一桌一几都有着引人感到賞心悅目的妙處。再配上那偉大的舞台塲面，美麗的舞娘，彩爛的背景，假使這是一齣沒有情節的片子，那色彩已足使人感到興奮了。何况那裹還有一個非常入情人理的故事。你可以當他是在諷剌，你可以富他是在勸世。總之，「比冀豐飛一是一張情節色彩歌舞佈景在同等的發展而產生的鉪片。那裏還有許多的笑料，如果你感到這春天是太煩惱的話，我勸你趕決上那兒去解解悶棋苑  鮑子波編　陸承鑄校　　開局法　第二十七局　　黑先　　　着法接上局　　車二進七改馬八進九　車九平四　車九平八　車一平二　車二進七　炮七時四　兵七進一　　　（解釋）　炮二平五至馬八進九已見前說，炮八平七以七路炮制反宮馬，最妥，對方旣先出橫車，再不宜用盤頭馬衝鋒，用則不利，用橫車出路無非四路與六路，其進攻目標在對方上二路，上二路有住友兵，則衝鋒失效，故用盤頭馬者，先須注意對方之車路，愼之愼之，紅方亦炮八平七讓炮，即是應對方炮八平七，兵七進一先手，相三進五應着，車二進七捉炮，此之謂假先手，車九平四官着，車二平三列着，馬三退五打死車。　　車二進七改馬八進九官着，車九平八出車，車二進七捉炮，此時捉炮與前不同，逼炮七進四冲亂對方陣綫，兵七進一得游藝珍聞　　共舞台主人張善琨之封翁六十大慶，該台全體藝員以一天包銀公賀，後台經輝陳月樓前晚向藝員通吿，徵求意見。　　武生張竹軒，近患腹癕症甚劇，在延醫診治中，向大舞台請假休息。　　靑島新新大舞台後台經理盛連奎來申邀角，前晚到共舞台訪田子文之師王德山及趙松樵，有所接洽。　　大世界大京班定星期一（十號）排練四本宏碧緣。　　聯友社定十四號公演何靜廬主編之新劇未免有情，主角已派定爲楊美媚之程秋萍，尹夢石之張志宏，王呆公之劉癙子，許雪塵之劉少英。溜冰術（十六）  蓮君琦珍　　身之運用法（續）　　外退第一式　　主肩中臂在後，客肩客臂在前，客腿客臀在前，目向圈綫內之中心而視。　　下圖爲第一式，叉名前順。　　外退第二式　　主肩主脅在前，客肩客臂在後，客腿客臀在後，目之視向對客肩之上。　　下圖爲第二式，又名後順。　　外退第三式　　主肩士臂在前，客肩客臂在後，客腿客臀花前，目之視向，對客肩之上。　　下圖爲第三式，名前逆。故都宮闈梨園秘史（一四一）  徐慕雲　　明朝右都御史却會判斷元代的寃案　　如其不然的話，蔡氏本係富有之家，何以剛一招了官司，就會「家業」「旦盡化光」呢？同時的婆母也改寬一件紫花老斗，這父是表示貧寒人家的裝束。她們婆媳二人突然間就會窮到這般光景，可見這全是受了驢兒覇佔產業的影響，方有以致之。如其皮黃班演此劇時老是呌飾張驢兒的丑角穿那一件行頭，這不是太不合情理了麽？所以這雖是一點小節，然而與戲劇的情節上却關係的很大呢。第二，寳娥的父親，進京赴考後，榮任天官，回家祭掃，忽見六月三日天降大雪，知民間必有沉寃，於是傳令旗牌速命縣官停刑，親自間此案，讀狀時突見狀紙上有一犯女寳娥字樣，不覺大呌一驚，並連讀兩遍，所謂父女天性，此處之作工，唸白，與夫劇情之緊張，在在足使台下觀者動容。不知皮黃班演此，何以硬把這個脚色派在海瑞頭上，旣與竇娥絲毫不發生關係，而目對於離家已久的寳秀才始終也沒有個交代。這何如人家梆子班裏的父女團圓，來得入悄入理呢。况且皮黃班的詞裏還有老旦同旦角在法塲永訣前，最要緊的兩句問答，也是提到她的爹爹，老旦詞爲「倘若你爹爹回來，看望我兒，呌爲婆用何言答對？「旦答」哎呀婆婆呵，倘若爹爹回來，問起孩兒，休提法塲之事，就說孩兒得病而亡了。」這幾句詞兒，雖仍與晋梆千相同，可是人家因爲後邊眞能還出她個爹爹來，故而先在此最要關頭預伏一筆，好使得下文更有力量，如其用個海剛峯來道經此地，碰巧遇着此案，前來審理，試想那倒有多鬆勁呢。</p>

<p>Xiushui: After the Japanese army in Gao'an was forced to retreat entirely northward on the 7th, the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue them and recovered Gao'an at 7 a.m. on the 8th. The vanguard troops have already reached north of Dacheng, and the main force of the Chinese army is advancing towards Nanchang and Fengxin. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: News from the front: The Chinese army officially recovered Gao'an city at 7 a.m. this morning. The remaining Japanese troops are retreating towards Dacheng. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: Urgent telegram at 7 p.m. on the 8th: After the Chinese troops attacking Gao'an occupied the county seat, they launched a fierce attack on Dacheng, completely surrounding the Japanese troops there. Communication between the Japanese army on the Nanchang-Fengxin highway has been cut off by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops on both the Nanchang and Fengxin routes are extremely panicked. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: The Chinese troops who recovered Gao'an entered the city at dawn on the 8th amidst the cheers and firecrackers of the local populace. They are now clearing the streets and inspecting the spoils of war. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: Since the Chinese army voluntarily abandoned Gao'an on the evening of the 2nd and confronted the Japanese army across the Jin River, reinforcements from the Chinese side have been arriving successively, preparing for a counter-attack. At 4 p.m. on the 7th, the Chinese army advanced towards Gao'an in three routes: one route crossed the Jin River from the front, pressing towards the south of Gao'an; one route attacked Xiangfu Temple northeast of Gao'an; and another route advanced towards Wulipai northwest of Gao'an, forming an encirclement. By 5:30 p.m., all routes had made contact and fierce fighting ensued. By around 7 p.m., the Chinese army had occupied Wulipai, Xiangfu Temple, and other important strongholds around Gao'an city, completely surrounding Gao'an. At 10 p.m. that night, the three routes of the Chinese army had established close contact and began attacking the city.

<h3 id="e6">Why Did Italy Invade Albania? <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>While Hitler's eastward expansion policies are repeatedly successful and the Eastern European collective security organization under Chamberlain's leadership is still in progress, Mussolini, under the intertwining of envy and fear, launched the invasion of Albania. In a speech he delivered late last month, Mussolini already hinted at ambitions in the Mediterranean. At the beginning of this month, he made two unreasonable demands on the Albanian government: long-term stationing of troops and expansion of colonial quotas, using an ultimatum to coerce a response. Although Albania has always been a semi-dependent state of Italy, it felt that the fundamental survival of the country was at stake and could not tolerate this demand for national subjugation, so it resolutely refused. King Zog I issued an emergency order to prepare for resistance. As such, the Italian navy began attacking Albanian ports such as Durazzo and Valona on the morning of the 7th of this month. In just one and a half days, all major ports in Albania were occupied, but the Albanian government did not lose heart and continued to resist. Currently, the war is unfolding in the mountainous inland areas.</p>
<p>Albania is the smallest country in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula, with an area of over 27,000 square kilometers, only a quarter of Jiangsu Province in China, and a population of just over one million, equivalent to a single city of Nanjing in China. However, its location is between Greece and Yugoslavia, guarding the gateway to the Adriatic Sea and being a key point for Central Europe to access the sea from the south. Therefore, from the perspective of controlling the Balkan Peninsula or the Mediterranean, it is a strategically important area. Italy and Albania are separated by only a narrow strip of water, and the direction of Italian imperialism's development is the Balkan Peninsula on land and the Mediterranean at sea. Therefore, Albania became the target of its aggression. If Italy places Albania under its control, it not only passively eliminates a major threat on the opposite side of the Adriatic Sea but also actively gains an important base for dominating the Mediterranean and aspiring to the Balkans. Therefore, after Mussolini came to power, he harbored unlimited ambitions towards Albania. In November 1916, Italy and Albania signed the so-called Treaty of Tirana (the Albanian capital). The following year, in the same month, the two countries concluded a military alliance with a term of twenty years. Thus, Albania was already a protectorate of Italy in fact, and all sectors, including politics and economy, had close ties with Italy. Since Italy effectively controlled Albania, why now launch a massive campaign, attempting to conquer Albania by force? According to the Italian government's self-promotion, Italy requested Albania to revise the 1927 military alliance treaty, and anti-Italian demonstrations occurred in Albania, endangering the safety of Italian expatriates. Therefore, Italy had to use force to subdue the country. This is originally a set of aggression theories spoken in unison by aggressors around the world and has no credible value. In fact, since the Polish question arose, it forced democratic countries such as Britain and France to move towards collective security, with the possibility of encircling the German-Italian axis. Therefore, Italy was eager to cross the Adriatic Sea, attempting to firmly occupy Albania to gain a foothold in the Balkans, prevent contact between the small states in the north and south, and at the same time directly exert pressure on its closest neighbors, Yugoslavia and Greece, to prevent them from joining the Eastern European collective security organization. This is one of Mussolini's true reasons. Furthermore, what Italy cannot forget is to become the master of the Mediterranean. According to reports from London and Paris, Mussolini's plan is to occupy all the strategically important points of the Mediterranean, such as British-owned Gibraltar and French-owned Morocco. This time, the Albanian incident can be said to be the initial manifestation of Italy's ambitions in the Mediterranean. In short, Italy's invasion of Albania is a concrete manifestation of Italy's dual ambitions in the Balkans and the Mediterranean and is also an important move in the tactical maneuvering of the fascist front to deal with the democratic front.</p>
<p>However, things are not that simple. Italy's invasion of Albania also exposed the inherent contradictions of the fascist front. In other words, the opposition between Germany and Italy will become even more acute from now on. Originally, Italy has been operating in Albania at a huge cost, and its main purpose is to deal with Yugoslavia. Because the Dalmatian region along the coast of Yugoslavia and the port of Kotor are both extremely coveted by Italy, so with Italy having a foothold in Albania, southern Yugoslavia will become something it can easily seize. Yugoslavia was originally the most fortunate country after the European War. Most of its land in the north was the old territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After Germany's recent large-scale expansion of power in Central Europe, it has the possibility of using the issue of the ruled ethnic groups to carry out conspiracies against Yugoslavia, and even finding a seaport on the Adriatic Sea is not a fantasy. Germany's ambitions in the Balkans are certainly a threat to democratic countries such as Britain and France, but they are particularly painful for Italy. Therefore, this time, Italy's invasion of Albania, in addition to the aforementioned purpose, also has a subtle effect: attempting to strengthen control over Yugoslavia, prohibiting it from having any connection with any party, including Germany. It is rumored that Italy has offered guarantees to Yugoslavia, even if Germany attacks, Italy will do its best to protect it, in exchange for Yugoslavia's strict neutrality in the Albanian incident. It can be seen from this that the internal contradictions between Germany will unfold due to the Albanian question.</p>
<p>The Albanian army and people are currently fighting hard against violence, willing to shed their last drop of blood. Although countries such as Britain and France have not yet expressed active support, this incident is undoubtedly a touchstone for whether a collective security organization can be established. We believe that the longer the Albanian resistance lasts, the more it can truly consolidate the democratic front. At that time, the contradictions within the invading countries themselves will conversely continue to increase, and the result may be that they will suffer the evil consequences of self-destruction!</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Military News: Japanese troops in Shanxi have repeatedly attempted to "pacify" the Zhongtiao Mountains, launching numerous incursions, all of which have been heavily defeated and routed. Recently, the seventh incursion into Zhongtiao Mountain by the Japanese was met with a courageous counterattack by the Hua army and has ended in failure. The details are as follows: The Japanese troops entrenched in the Yinnan triangle launched a large-scale offensive into Zhongtiao Mountain from Hanyang, Yu County, Yuncheng, Anyi, Xia County, and other places, starting on the 28th of last month, attempting to break through the Hua army in one fell swoop with a multi-pronged attack. The Japanese troops from Hanyang and Yu County, after capturing Hua's Ruicheng, joined forces with the Japanese troops from Jie County on the 30th to attack Monan, engaging in fierce fighting with the Hua army in Dagou Nan. The Hua army, in order to lure the enemy in deep, voluntarily retreated to Xiaogou Nan. The Japanese troops then launched a fierce attack with aircraft and artillery, but the Hua army resisted to the death, and a powerful unit circled around the flanks and rear of the Japanese troops from Yuecun, launching a fierce attack from both sides, killing a large number of Japanese troops. The Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, fled in disarray towards Monan Town. The Hua army, taking advantage of the momentum of victory, launched a resolute pursuit and captured Monan on the first and recovered Ruicheng on the second. The Japanese troops fled back to their lairs. The Japanese troops in Anxia initially launched a partial offensive east from Wangyu Kou, which failed. They then launched an offensive south from Zhangdian Town, engaging in fierce fighting with the Hua army at Fengxie Kou and Shuncun, with repeated charges and counter-charges, more than ten times. The Japanese troops ultimately failed to achieve their objectives. On the 31st of last month, the Hua army in that area suddenly shifted to the offensive, routing the Japanese troops facing them in one fell swoop and pursuing them fiercely. The Japanese were nearly routed and fled in two directions through Dachen Cun and Yangchao, towards Zhangdian Town and the north of Baishu Cen and Wujia Gou.

<p>Xingji: After the Japanese army repeatedly carried out its so-called "mopping-up operations" in western Shanxi, northern Shanxi, and southern Shanxi, running into obstacles everywhere, it has recently transferred heavy troops from the Datong-Puzhou, Zhengtai, Pinghan, and Daqing railway lines, attempting to encircle the Hua forces in southeastern Shanxi. Japanese General Sugi arrived in Jiexiu a few days ago to plot this conspiracy. At the end of last month, the Japanese troops in Pingyao re-occupied Dongquan Town (twenty miles southeast of the city).

The Hua army bravely blocked the attack along the Wanghe, Wangtao, and Ziping (all north of Qinyuan) line, engaging in three rounds of bayonet charges. After fierce fighting for half a day, over 300 Japanese troops were killed. Subsequently, the Japanese troops frequently released poison gas, and many Hua army officers and soldiers were poisoned, so they shifted south to meet the attack. The Japanese troops in Hongdong, Fushan, and Anze all moved east towards Qixian, and the Japanese troops in Taiyuan moved towards Zihong Kou and Mailing Pass, attempting to join forces to attack Erqin (Qin County and Qinyuan). Japanese troops have been increased in Pindin, Heshun, and Jiezigou south of Zhengtai, as well as in Wu'an, Zhi County, and Hui County in northern Henan. Over 2,000 Japanese troops have been added to Daoqing Qianqinghua and Qinyang. According to reports, the Japanese army's nine-pronged attack last spring was disastrous. This time, with another incursion, it will undoubtedly be crushed by the Hua army. (Seventh Dispatch)</p>

<p>Shanxi Front: The enemy in Anyi, Maoyuncheng, Yongji, and surrounding areas in southern Shanxi launched fierce attacks on our Zhongtiao Mountain positions this week in several routes. One route consisted of over 3,000 enemies, heading towards Dachen Village; another route consisted of over 2,000 enemies, attacking Monan Town; and another route consisted of over 1,000 enemies, attacking Nanchiu Village. Each route had enemy aircraft assisting in the attack, attempting to seize important strongholds such as Lan Jindu and Pingguan, and were extremely active. Our army, relying on favorable terrain, launched fierce counterattacks, fighting back and forth. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented in recent months in this area. Dachen Village, Monan Town, and Nanchiu Village were lost and regained repeatedly. Ultimately, because our officers and soldiers fought bravely and bloody, the enemy's entire offensive was defeated and routed, and each of these places remained in our hands. In the battle of Dachen Village, the enemy suffered over 1,200 casualties, and an enemy aircraft was shot down in Nanchiu Village, with both the aircraft and its crew destroyed. The enemy's main force suffered such a major blow that it was almost completely sacrificed. Now, in various places in Pinglu, our army's morale is even stronger. In Yicheng in eastern Shanxi, Yangqu in western Shanxi, and Jingle in northern Shanxi, our enemy armies also engaged in repeated fierce fighting. The enemy army attacked us in several routes with thousands of men. Under our brave resistance, the enemy was heavily damaged and fled. Most of the enemy troops in Jingle fled to Xinxian County, which we have been fiercely besieging until noon on the fourth. We once stormed into the city. The remaining enemy troops, stubbornly resisting in the city, are no more than a few hundred and will not be difficult to clear.</p>
<p>Hubei-Hunan Front: On both banks of the Xiang River in central Hubei, our enemies are still facing each other across the river, with sporadic artillery battles occurring. The enemy occupying Nanhe Du in Hanchuan was counterattacked by us on the first and defeated, with the remaining enemies retreating back to Hanchuan, and we recovered the area. On the same day, the enemy in Yuekou attacked Luo Jia Dian and Henglin Kou in the evening, but was bravely repelled, with over a hundred enemies killed. Another unit of the enemy attempted to cross the Zhang Jia Dian river stealthily, but was heavily attacked by our army, with the enemy suffering heavy casualties and fleeing to Zhongxiang. Our army then captured Zhou Wang Zhuang Temple and other key points. Three days later, we stormed into the city, killing a large number of enemy troops. In southern Hubei, a unit of our army captured Qigu Mountain on the same day, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. In northern Hunan, our army captured Xin Kai Tang near Yueyang on the third. The enemy suffered heavy losses and sent a large number of reinforcements this week to launch a fierce counterattack. After several days of fierce fighting, we achieved a great victory, killing over 2,000 enemy troops. Currently, there are no enemy traces in Xin Kai Tang, Ma Tang, and other places. Our army took advantage of the victory to advance, directly approaching the suburbs of Yueyang, and are jointly besieging the county seat. The remaining enemies are still stubbornly resisting, and the battle is extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Henan Front: The fighting was more intense in the Xinyang area. Our army besieged the county seat on three sides last week, cutting off the enemy's retreat. This week, the enemy sent 1,000-2,000 reinforcements, with many artillery pieces and aircraft, to launch a counterattack in several routes. The two sides engaged in unprecedented fierce fighting in Luotuo Dian, Shizi Po, You River, and other places near the county seat. After suffering losses, the enemy released poison gas indiscriminately, but failed to succeed. Currently, the strongholds in the four suburbs of the city are still in our hands, and all traffic in all directions has been completely cut off by us. The enemy stubbornly resisting in the city is in a dead end. As for the enemy in eastern Henan, this week they joined forces with the puppet army of Cao Xichen to attack Luyi in the west, but were counterattacked by us, with over 200 enemy and puppet officers and soldiers killed. Over a hundred people, including the puppet army leader Cao Xichen, were captured. The enemy of four or five hundred in Yuanwu, northern Henan, used artillery fire to cover their advance to the southwest on the morning of the first, engaging in fierce fighting with us in the area east of Zhan Dian. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and fled back along the same route that night. There has been no movement so far. Also, the enemy in San Liuzhai forced civilians to block the breach, but on the morning of the second, they were bravely attacked by our army, and everyone responded and attacked from inside and outside, killing a large number of enemies. The enemy appeared to be fleeing east.</p>
<p>In addition, (1) In the Tongling and Qingyang areas of southern Anhui, the fighting between our enemy armies is still very fierce. The strongholds of Zengxing Shan, Paifang Shan, and Chengjia Da Shan have all been recaptured. Another unit of our army attacking Wanzhi and Jiuli Shan has occupied the enemy's first line of defense and is now continuing to advance. (2) The Jiangnan area our army, launched attacks on Yixing in several routes in recent days, has recovered Hu Jun and Ren Mountain, and has now reached the suburbs of the city and is stepping up the siege. (3) In Suiyuan Province, over a thousand enemy infantry, cavalry, and artillery divided into three routes from Baotou, Salaqi, and Guyang at dawn on the 31st to attack our army in Daqingshan. Our army used the natural dangers to launch a timely attack, killing over 500 enemies. They are still facing off against each other. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Competing for Control of the Mediterranean; Opposition Among European Powers Becomes More Apparent; Italy's Armed Invasion of Albania Undermines the Anglo-Italian Agreement; London and Paris Diplomatically Active <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(London) A diplomatic reporter for the Mancester Guardian stated that the German-Italian plan to dominate the Mediterranean is gradually becoming apparent. At present, Italy has now controlled the central part of the Mediterranean, and Germany and Italy are consolidating their position in Spain, which they had already occupied before Franco's victory. Germany and Italy have obtained strongholds in Majorca, Spanish Morocco, and various Spanish ports, and with their growing power, they are guiding the pro-fascist movement, and will strive for control of the western Mediterranean. At the same time, Germany, with its rapid advance to the southeast and its efforts to seek political and economic influence in Yugoslavia, and Italy, with its actions in Albania, are preparing to establish a superior position in the eastern Mediterranean. In exchange, Italy's victory in Albania will inevitably affect Yugoslavia, Greece, and Romania. Today, to say that Italy's actions will not change the status quo in the Mediterranean is simply ridiculous. Therefore, Italy's actions have undermined the Anglo-Italian agreement, and the British government must pay close attention to Mussolini as it does to Hitler. (Eighth Reuters Dispatch) (London) Britain and France are currently exchanging views on Italy's sudden invasion of Albania. Britain recognizes Italy's united front, so it is difficult to take effective retaliatory action against Italy for the time being. (Eighth Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British officials now feel that a judgment on the situation in Albania can only be made after the situation has crystallized and official reports have been considered. However, it is noteworthy that the Italian government informed the British government on April 4 that it had no intention of changing the status quo in Albania, and that the Italian government's plan to enhance Italian-Albanian relations, which it had submitted to the Albanian government through ordinary diplomatic channels, did not contain any elimination of Albanian sovereignty, integrity, or independence. British Foreign Secretary Halifax is currently staying in London to closely monitor the situation, and it is heard that other cabinet members have not traveled far from London either. Those who visited the British Foreign Office today included the ambassadors of France and Turkey, the envoys of Romania, Greece, Albania, and Poland, and the Italian chargé d'affaires. (Seventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Albanian incident, the French government has been extremely active diplomatically. Ambassador Corbin to England held talks with British Undersecretary Cadogan, and then reported the progress to Foreign Minister Bonnet by long-distance telephone. The Foreign Minister also met separately with British Ambassador to France Phipps, Polish Ambassador Lukasiewicz, Turkish Ambassador Suad, US Ambassador Bullitt, Soviet Ambassador Suritz, and Yugoslav Envoy Buhe 区 to discuss the Albanian incident. Those responsible have recently stated that Italy's actions have violated the Anglo-Italian agreement of April 16, 1938. The United Kingdom has a greater vested interest than France. What is the intention of that government? It is still unknown, but it can be asserted that it will not be passive. However, the mutual assistance agreement recently concluded with Poland, as well as the agreements negotiated with Romania and the Soviet Union, do not apply to Italy's current actions. This is also the actual situation. (Seventh Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that Prime Minister Chamberlain will return to London from Scotland to decide whether to immediately guarantee the security of Greece, thereby proving that Britain is faster to react to events than all other powerful countries. After the establishment of an agreement between Britain and Greece, Britain may need to use Greek seaports, such as Corfu, to facilitate naval operations. This is also possible. (Eighth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Rumors are circulating that the British fleet will occupy Corfu, southwest of Albania and not far from the Greek coast, but this news has not been confirmed as of noon today. It is the key point of the exit of the Adriatic Sea. It is said that the island was once forcibly occupied by Italy in 1923. Will the British fleet preempt it? It is said that two teams of the British Mediterranean Fleet arrived near Corfu yesterday to occupy the island, although it has not been confirmed. (Eighth Haitong Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) When the House of Commons reconvenes on the 19th, Labour MP Henderson will ask Prime Minister Chamberlain whether the government intends to invite China and other countries in the Far East to join any anti-aggressor countries. On the same day, Labour MP Davies will ask Shakespeare, the parliamentary commissioner of the Admiralty, whether he can inform the House of Commons in detail about the information he has received that Japan is now planning to build and install 18-inch guns. He will also ask the government whether it will change the plans of new warships set by the Admiralty as a result. (Sixth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The cabinet held a meeting at 11:00 this morning at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. Prime Minister Chamberlain had not yet returned to London and was replaced by Finance Minister Simon as chairman. Foreign Secretary Halifax, Minister for Coordination of Defense Chatfield, Air Minister Wood, War Minister Hore-Belisha, Naval Minister Stanhope, Home Secretary Hoare, and Lord Privy Seal Anderson all attended. Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately reported on diplomacy, explaining the international situation and reading reports sent by envoys stationed in the Balkan countries. It is heard that the Foreign Secretary said that Yugoslavia is unlikely to react to Italy's invasion of Albania. The Foreign Office has already instructed Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine to ask the Italian government whether this action can be reconciled with the international obligations it has accepted, since it participated in the Ambassadorial Conference in 1921 and agreed to guarantee Albania's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and also signed an agreement with Britain on April 16 last year agreeing to respect the status quo in the Mediterranean. What is being done now is inevitably in conflict with it. All cabinet members expressed their unanimous agreement. (Eighth Havas)</p>

The Albanian parliament met all day yesterday and unanimously rejected Italy's ultimatum, insisting on defending the country. (Eighth Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Albanian Capital: Semi-official sources here recently issued a message stating that after 180 Italian warships attacked our major ports, the ports of Santi, Han de, Medua, Durazzo, Valona, and Santi Gamin Da have fallen one after another. Our troops have now retreated inland and continue to resist. Italian troops attacked the port of Durazzo as many as seven times and landed three times, penetrating as far as the vicinity of the city hall, before being repelled by our troops. Later, the Italian side mobilized fresh troops and launched another attack under heavy artillery fire. Due to the disparity in numbers, our troops had no choice but to retreat with pain. The intensity of the resistance can be seen from this. (Seventh Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Albanian Capital: King Zog I issued a statement to the people yesterday, saying, "The government of Italy, regardless of years of diplomatic relations and in violation of current articles, made various demands on our country the other day. All of their terms are destructive to our independence, harmful to our sovereignty, and depriving us of our freedom. After careful consideration, I and the government authorities believe that there is no room for acceptance in order to maintain the status of the country. This country has now resorted to force, and all of our people should work together to overcome national difficulties in order to defend the motherland, maintain independence, and vow to resist until the last drop of blood. Although our country has a small population, it has been known for its bravery since ancient times. At this critical moment of survival, all people with blood and energy must be loyal, brave, and resolute, carry forward the national spirit, unite sincerely, resist foreign aggression together, and eventually receive help from heaven. This is what I firmly believe. The times are urgent and the enemy is deep, and I sincerely hope that the people of the whole country will be of one mind and one heart to serve the country.

<p>Albanian Capital: The information department recently issued a statement to the people of the whole country and the Italian nation by radio today, using it to fiercely criticize the policies promoted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stating that this policy will cause the Italian people to bleed and the country to be on the verge of bankruptcy. Now, it is attacking a small country with a million people with a large country with 40 million people, sacrificing the lives of young people in order to carry out imperialistic attempts. It should be known that this small country has always valued independence and sovereignty, and will never easily succumb without resisting to the last drop of blood. "Mussolini recently commented on the country of Czechoslovakia, saying, 'If a civilized country does not know how to resist the coming of foreign troubles, then I dare to assert that the time for this country to change its fate has matured.' The Albanian nation now takes this slogan of Mussolini as a creed. Not only the men, but also the women and children of the whole country, are willing to re-express their heroic spirit to the civilized world during this national crisis." (Seventh Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>After Italy launched a combined sea, land, and air attack on the Albanian coast, the Albanian capital Durazzo, Vlorë, Shengjin, and other places were attacked. Although the Albanian army was outnumbered by the Italian army, they resisted bravely. The Albanian government has acknowledged that the above locations fell yesterday at 4:00 PM. The Albanian soldiers who died in the battle numbered 140, with hundreds wounded. The Italian army suffered 25 dead and 60 wounded. It is reported that before the Italian army captured Durazzo, they were repelled four times by the Albanians. Afterward, the Italian navy and air force carried out extensive bombing before they successfully landed. The reason why the Albanians could not effectively stop the Italian landing was due to the poor equipment of the Albanian army. The Albanian government now plans to mobilize 120,000 reserve soldiers to attack the 30,000 Italian troops that have now invaded Albanian territory. However, according to neutral observers, the Albanian strategy should be to retreat into the deep mountains and engage in guerrilla warfare from there.</p>
<p>According to Italian radio broadcasts, the Albanians are still resisting. In some areas, Albanians retreating into the mountains are rolling boulders down from the mountain peaks to impede the Italian advance. However, the number of Albanian troops seems to be small, and they will not be difficult to eliminate in one fell swoop. Currently, only 12,000 Albanians are engaged in the resistance, including regular soldiers, as well as farmers, workers, and merchants who have risen up in revolt. At the same time, 30,000 Italian troops have already landed, and it is expected that the number will increase to 60,000 within 48 hours. According to an Italian announcement broadcast from Rome last night, Italian troops have advanced nine miles from Durazzo. Albanians resisting along the coast have been defeated. The Italian vanguard has advanced to a point fifteen miles from the Albanian capital. When the Albanians withdrew from Durazzo, they blew up the bridge over the Ishëm River, but this only temporarily hindered the Italian motorized units. According to Albanian sources, Durazzo and Vlorë were severely bombed, and Alessio was reduced to ashes. The bombing of Durazzo and Vlorë was carried out by the Italian navy, and countless civilians died in the attacks. Now, Albanian hunters and those with firearms have risen to fight, attempting to block the Italian army's rapid advance on the Albanian capital. Even children are throwing bricks at the Italian troops. Italian bombers are now largely providing cover for the Italian advance, with some circling over the Albanian capital.

<p>(Rome) A semi-official message received here this morning from the Albanian capital states, "After King Zog I, along with his family and government ministers, left the capital last night, the city was thrown into a state of panic. Armed prisoners released from prisons are indiscriminately firing, and this has not stopped as of dawn this morning. The royal palace has been looted, and the safety of the Italian legation is also threatened. The Albanian government's gendarmes stationed in front of the legation have now left. The city was ordered to maintain order last night by Italian officer Colonel Stanatis, who arrested many troublemakers and made every effort to maintain telegraph and telephone communications."

<p>(Rome) The Italian official news agency reports that the Italian envoy to Albania and other Italian officials are all in the legation, directing armed Italians to arrange defenses and prepare to defend themselves against accidents. Rioters, who were armed a few days ago and attacked Italian expatriates, are now engaged in looting in Tirana. King Zog has left the Albanian capital and his whereabouts are unknown. After the king left, gunfire was heard from time to time in the Albanian capital, especially near the Italian legation. Yesterday at dawn, many cars, mixed with Red Cross ambulances, filled with valuable objects, drove from Tirana to Elbasan. King Zog is now planning to conduct diplomatic negotiations with the Italian commander-in-chief in order to stop the Italian military actions in Albania. It is expected that a provisional government will soon be organized by responsible individuals, and Albania will be placed under Italian guidance. (April 7th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Albania is located on the western coast of the Balkan Peninsula, bordering northern Greece. It has a population of 1.5 million. Before 1912, it was part of the Turkish Empire. The country is mostly mountainous and almost entirely undeveloped. The mountains have high-quality forests, and wine and olive oil are the main products. The people mostly raise cattle in the plains and sheep in the mountains. The main cities are Scutari, Berat, Janina. The people of the country belong to one of the oldest races in the Balkan Peninsula and are known for their strong independence and adherence to old customs. Most are Muslims, with the remaining two-fifths either Greek Orthodox or Catholic. The town of Durazzo is the ancient Roman town of Dyrrhachium, a prosperous port in Roman times. Albania has been under foreign rule for centuries, first belonging to the Goths, then ruled by Serbians, Normans, Sicilians, and Turks. The Albanian people are rich in the spirit of independence, and although sovereignty was lost for a long time, they attempted independence several times in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries without success. In 1913, after the end of the Balkan Wars, the Treaty of London granted independence. Italy's first act of aggression against Albania occurred in December 1914, citing the pretext of Austria's expansion of power in Serbia and sending troops to Vlorë on the Albanian coast to resist it. The 1915 agreement secretly promised Albania to Italy as part of the reward for Italy's participation in World War I. The Albanian monarch was unaware of this and agreed to grant Vlorë sovereignty to Italy and allow Italy freedom of action in Albania in order to seek Italy's neutrality. Subsequently, the Italians withdrew from Durazzo but continued to occupy Vlorë, thereby controlling southern Albania. The 1919 San Remo Conference finally placed Albania under Italian trusteeship. In 1927, Italy and Albania concluded a treaty of friendship and arbitration. In 1928, the Albanian Constitutional Assembly proclaimed a civil monarchy, and Ahmed Zogu was given the title of King of Albania. King Zog I is the only monarch in Europe who has converted to Islam. He was born on October 8, 1895, and studied at a Turkish military academy. As an adult, he managed his father's property and, due to feudal traditions, the people obeyed the leader of the Zogu clan, allowing him to control thirteen tribes. The king embraced nationalism and had great ambitions, so he soon became involved in local politics. In 1912, Albania joined the Balkan Wars to resist Turkey, and the king served in the Western army, eventually winning Albania's independence. After Albania declared independence, Prince William of Wied was made its monarch in 1914. The king and William were close friends, so he was one of his right-hand men. During the war, the king joined the new nationalist opposition party. Soon after, he conspired with the party to stage an uprising against the monarch. As World War I broke out, the king joined the Austrian army and led a large contingent to resist the Italian army. After the end of the war, Italians, Yugoslavs, and Albanian nationalists competed to claim this small country. The king returned from Vienna and led the Albanians to reject foreign troops on the border. In 1924, the king once fled as a political fugitive, then regrouped his comrades in Belgrade and invaded Albania in January 1925, proclaiming the restoration of nationalism. His troops were invincible wherever they went, and after the success, he was elected as the first president of the Republic of Albania. In 1928, he was unanimously elected by the National Assembly and assumed the title of king. (Reuters)</p>

<p>(Washington) Reliable sources say that the United States will refuse to recognize the occupation of Albania. Italy's unjustified aggression should shatter the illusions of some who believe that concessions can be used to entice one side of the Axis to break away. Neither side of the Axis has trustworthiness and both are aggressive in nature, being cut from the same cloth. This is especially evident in light of current events. Although Britain is working to organize an anti-aggression bloc, it is believed here that efforts are still needed to achieve this goal. (April 7th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull spent a long time at Warm Springs today discussing the current situation regarding the Italian invasion of Albania with President Roosevelt. It is reported that they discussed the possible impact of this event on US relations with Italy and Albania. (April 7th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the incident in Albania, observers here all said that the US government would certainly condemn this Italian outrage, but would not necessarily take concrete action. American public opinion was originally very indignant, and was even more resentful because Italy's actions took place on Good Friday. The Albanian king and queen, both young and beautiful, have always been praised by Americans. The queen's mother is also from a prominent American family. The American public is therefore deeply sympathetic to the tragic fate of Albania. The country's expatriate community in the United States numbers around 40,000, and they had just celebrated the birth of the prince a few days ago. How could such a sudden change occur? The homeland has been invaded, King Zog I has hastily left the capital, and the queen has fled to a foreign land. Their grief and indignation can be imagined. Albanian Minister to the United States, Koco Gliozheni, recently visited Secretary of State Hull for discussions. After his country's defeat in the war, his legation here is unwilling to allow the Italian embassy to take it over, just as Czech Minister Hurban did not hand over his embassy to the German embassy. Koco Gliozheni recently released a statement to the newspapers, saying, "Italians have many advantages and are worthy of being called a great nation. It is a pity that God did not give them a sense of chivalry. Our queen gave birth to a prince just a few days ago, and now she has had to leave her bed and flee to a foreign land with her two-day-old infant. The tragedy of the situation is beyond words. Italy, without provocation, uses aggression as a matter of course. The population ratio between the two countries is 40 to 1 (Italy has a population of 42 million, while Albania has just over one million). In terms of the size of military equipment, the ratio is 1,000 to 1. It is not surprising that an egg cannot stand against a stone. However, I fear that Italy may not be able to obtain lasting benefits, and its loss of honor is especially concerning. Would a wrestling champion challenge another wrestler, or would they bully a child? Is that what a brave man does? Our intellectual circles often want to cooperate closely with Italy in culture, economy, and politics on honorable terms, but that country now responds with a punch. It is truly heartbreaking."

<p>(Paris) After Italy used force in Albania, individuals here familiar with the political situation in the Balkan Peninsula stated that the Italian government had informed the Yugoslav government of its wishes at any time. Yugoslavia may not have any reaction to this incident. The fact that the Italian government recently concentrated troops in the area near the Yugoslav border and has now completely withdrawn them shows that Italy has no worries. As for Albania's past circumstances, although Italy has repeatedly exerted pressure, attempting to control its ports so that it can completely control the Adriatic Sea in the event of war, King Zog I has always firmly refused. For self-defense, the Albanian government has contacted Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia separately. Among them, Greece has not accepted the proposal for jointly guaranteeing Albania's independent sovereignty. At the same time, the strength of the Balkan Entente has also been weakened due to Romania's difficult situation. Albania has been isolated and helpless, so Italy has taken advantage of the situation. This is seen as unavoidable. (April 7th, Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Italy's Long-Planned Annexation of Albania; Incited Political Turmoil Unsuccessfully; Incident Finally Erupts <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Corfu, Greece - Although Italy's sudden seizure of Albania seems abrupt, the deterioration of relations between the two countries has not been a matter of days. Recently, well-informed sources here revealed its contents. It is claimed that in November 1938, General Giro, a representative of the Italian Fascist Party, went to Tirana on a mission to promote the Fascist system. This was opposed by King Zog I, who considered it inappropriate. General Giro stayed in the capital and notified the Italian Prime Minister of this intention. In January of this year, General Giro returned to Tirana on a secret mission, intending to exploit the divisions between the various political parties in Albania, incite a coup, and support Vlashi to oppose Zog I. Vlashi is the wealthiest man in Albania, and his daughter was once engaged to the king, but the engagement was suddenly broken off, causing Vlashi great resentment. In 1934, he colluded with someone named Kloya (who had lived in Italy for a long time) to plot against the king, but was unsuccessful. In February of this year, General Giro again plotted to depose Zog I and support Vlashi as king. However, his intentions were betrayed by a member of his party, who informed the king. The king was able to quell the disturbance in an instant, and many of the remaining members were arrested. General Giro and the Italian envoy hastily returned to their country. Later, at the strong request of the Italian government, Zog I released the rebels. Zog I had no choice but to release them and ordered them to leave the country immediately. These people fled to Italy. From then on, Italian-Albanian relations gradually deteriorated. Furthermore, because of the insatiable demands of the Italian government, relations became even worse, eventually leading to this incident. (April 8th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian newspaper "Il Giornale d'Italia" today published an article by Gaida, stating that new and important events will now be achieved in Eastern Europe. Italy, because it has accepted the cries of patriotic Albanian people who can no longer endure the tyranny of their king, and because it has seen the necessity of protecting the lives and property of Italians in Albania from the open harm of armed mobs, has today sent troops to land in Albania, without encountering resistance, and is advancing towards various key points. In the past few days, King Zog I of Albania had requested the Italian government to provide new assistance and protection, and to send troops to defend certain parts of Albania. However, the Italian government later learned that Zog I intended to use Italian troops to attack Yugoslavia in order to disrupt the friendly relations between Italy and Yugoslavia, so it rejected his request. Zog I and others, whose plans were thwarted, turned to anger, and there were acts of violence against Italian expatriates in Albania. The Italian government asked Zog I to pay attention to his responsibilities, but the Albanian king avoided this issue and proposed new conspiracies with questionable intentions. Italy was therefore forced to intervene to restore the peace and order and civil liberties in Albania that had already been destroyed. This decision will not alarm neighboring countries, as Italy is eager to cooperate with all its neighbors to maintain peace in the Balkans and Europe. (April 7th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Athens - Greece borders Albania, so it is paying close attention to the Italian military invasion of Albania. However, as of this time, there has been no official statement explaining the government's attitude. (April 8th, Huitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Corfu, Greece (urgent telegram) - People here generally fear that Italy will take action against this island within a few days. (Note: After Italian General Tellini was killed by Greeks on August 27, 1923, Italy seized this island on the pretext of occupation.

<p>(Paris) The trip of Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu to Istanbul to hold talks with the Turkish Foreign Minister is highly valued by diplomatic circles here. It is said that the Balkan Entente countries (Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia) will decide how to respond to the threats from Germany and Italy during these talks. Among them, Romania is at the forefront of the German and Italian eastward expansion policy and must obtain the assistance of the Balkan Entente countries, especially Turkey, in order to resist effectively. It is even more crucial for Greece, Romania, and Turkey to strengthen cooperation with Bulgaria, depending on Turkey's attitude. (April 8th, Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Burgos - The Spanish government announced today its accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact, stating that the government is currently surrounded by dangers on all sides and that this action is taken to strengthen the government's defensive position. The original proposal for joining the pact was signed in Burgos by Spanish Foreign Minister General Jordana, the German and Italian Ambassadors, and the Japanese Minister. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>According to the contents of this agreement, it is divided into three items: (1) The Spanish National Government joins the Anti-Comintern Pact; (2) The method of cooperation between Spain and other signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact will be stipulated in a separate supplementary agreement; (3) This agreement is written in German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, and their legal value is the same.

<h3 id="e36">First Stage of Anti-Japanese War in Northern Jiangsu - Huaiyin Falls After the Fall of Donghai and Shuyang Counties - Chinese Troops Continuously Attacking Behind Japanese Lines - And Will Soon Coordinate with Guerrillas to Recover Various Counties <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Taizhou Correspondence: Since the fall of Xuzhou, northern Jiangsu has been isolated. Relying on the calm response and hard work of the military and political authorities, they have managed to hold on. Although the Japanese army has repeatedly invaded, they have all been repelled head-on by the Chinese army. In mid-February, the Japanese army again drew troops from the Jinpu Railway line, piecing together bandit-puppet forces of Li Shouxin, Liu Guitang, etc., claiming to be three joint detachments, along with more than 30 tanks and armored vehicles and 7 aircraft (3 transferred from Xuzhou, 2 from Suqian airport, and 2 from Yangzhou airport), launching simultaneously from Haizhou, Guanyun, Shuyang, and Siyang, with the goal of capturing Huaiyin, the temporary provincial capital of Jiangsu. After the heroic defense of the troops in the Haizhou, Shuyang, Siyang, and Lianshui areas, bloody battles were fought, and fierce offensives were repeatedly frustrated. Finally, due to the intense artillery fire of the Japanese army, Donghai, Shuyang, Siyang, and Lianshui were successively abandoned. At this point, Huaiyin was surrounded by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Huaiyin Falls, Wealth Plundered</p>
<p>The Japanese army entered Huaiyin city around 12:00 p.m. on March 2. Chinese troops had previously laid landmines at both ends of North Gate Street and poured gasoline all over the bridge surface, but unfortunately, before they could destroy it, the Japanese soldiers had already arrived, which was regrettable. The East Gate was destroyed by the Chinese army during the shift. Other military and political institutions such as the Huaiyin Power Plant, Dafeng Flour Mill, Huainong, Xinyingfang, and the Provincial Government Security Office were mostly destroyed by the Chinese army. The Japanese army entered the city through the North Gate, first with more than 10 tanks as a guide, patrolling back and forth on the road from the North Gate to the South Gate, and firing machine guns many times. Seeing no reaction, they stopped and gathered in front of the South City Park, establishing a temporary headquarters inside the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters. The next day, they moved to the former site of the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office. On the morning of the 3rd, Japanese soldiers searched everywhere, and closed all the city gates. More than a dozen local ruffians and scoundrels who recognized the enemy as their father flattered and led the way, looting the property of merchants and residents from door to door, using more than 20 loaded trucks to transport it all away. The post office on East Gate Street and the telegraph office on Hebei Ten Mile Long Street were closed by the Japanese military police. Most of the telegraph office personnel dispersed. Only the director, Zou Guoke, and a few employees gathered at the tea hermitage outside Beiyu to keep the machines, but there was no work to do. All the post office employees, on the morning of the 1st, sealed and used two civilian boats, and drove down the Grand Canal, planning to open in Baoying or Gaoyou to stand by. Unexpectedly, while passing through Huaian, they saw Japanese cavalry and tanks galloping on the highway, and machine guns were fired at both banks of the Grand Canal. Seeing this, the postal workers knew that they could not move forward, so they returned to Huaiyin. Now a temporary post office has been established outside Donggan. Director Deng Hongye leads all employees to receive and send letters and work as usual.</p>
<p>Planned Formation of a Puppet Association Failed</p>
<p>According to residents who escaped from the city, the number of Japanese soldiers was not very large. There were only about 100 stationed at Huaiyin Normal School, and about 30 at the county government and county party headquarters. Because the Japanese soldiers were afraid of attacks by the Chinese army, the garrison was often moved. There were even fewer soldiers stationed outside the city, only about 100 stationed near the airport in Xinyingfang. Japanese tanks and armored vehicles were all placed in the Tongyuan Bureau Commissioner's Office outside the city. The Japanese soldiers searched the Salvation Academy outside the West City and the Provincial Government across the river. Because the abandoned objects of each part were mostly taken away by the nearby unscrupulous people, the Japanese soldiers gained nothing and returned disappointed. After the commander of the Japanese troops, Kikukawa, arrived in Huaiyin, he ordered local villains to organize a puppet maintenance association, inviting Li Yushu, president of the Jisheng Association Qingjiang Branch, and Huang Zihou, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to serve as committee members. Li and others firmly refused to accept, because Huaiyin was still under the control of the Chinese army's counter-offensive troops, and the situation was uncertain, so it was abandoned.</p>
<p>Huaian and Baoying Suffer the Same Catastrophe</p>
<p>In Huaian, because the position is not as important as Huaiyin, there are even fewer Japanese soldiers stationed, less than 200 inside and outside the city. Huaicheng was the government seat during the late Qing Dynasty, and many officials and wealthy merchants started their families and prospered here. Their purses were full, and they spared no expense in material enjoyment. On the 2nd, after the county town fell into the hands of the Japanese army, the Japanese soldiers closed all the city gates and searched door to door. As for like utensils and clothing supplies, etc., following the Huaiyin method, they used more than 20 loaded trucks, going back and forth to Lianyungang, unloading them into transport ships, and shipping them back to Japan. This kind of behavior is really no different from piracy. Baoying County was once occupied, but it was very temporary. After the Chinese army's large-scale pressure, the Japanese soldiers fled back to Huaian. The people of Baodi have always been timid. Since the War of Resistance, they have never been visited by airplanes and bombs. On the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of this month, Japanese planes bombed Shiying, dropping no less than 100 bombs on the embankment along the canal and inside Baoying city. Merchants and residents felt that the war had extended to them, so they moved away one after another. After the Japanese soldiers entered the city, they plundered everything. Because the people evacuated in a hurry, except for gold, silver, and jewelry, like utensils and clothing were not taken away, so they were completely taken away by the Japanese soldiers. The amount of loss is no less than ten million. Since it was recovered by the Chinese army, merchants and residents who had avoided have returned one after another, and the market is gradually returning to normal.</p>
<p>Heroic Sacrifice in the Fierce Battle of Gaoyou</p>
<p>Gaoyou stands on the front line at the southernmost end of the Grand Canal. After the Chinese army retreated from Huaiyin and Huaian, it was caught between the enemy's front and back. Fortunately, the garrison 117th Division 697th Regiment and all parties in the party and government cooperated to stand firm in the midst of danger and shock. On the morning of March 10, the commander of the Japanese army in Yangzhou, Ogawa, transferred 900 to 600 Japanese soldiers, more than 100 horses, and 6 artillery pieces to invade the Zhaoguan Dam position of the Chinese army. From morning to dusk, they fired no less than 500 shells. At the same time, in the drizzle, they covered more than 20 speedboats and detoured around the west of Gaoyou Lake to attack the Lukin Chinese army position, implementing a winding attack. The Chinese defenders of Zhaoguan Dam were attacked from the front and back by the Japanese army, and they fell one after another, fighting bravely. Their heroic sacrifice was enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep. However, Lukin was tight, so they had to abandon the Zhaoguan Dam position. Soon, reinforcements arrived. A certain battalion commander raised his arms and shouted, and the three armies gave their lives, fighting one against a hundred, and finally repelled the stubborn enemy and restored the position. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, and 7 Japanese speedboats, 22 civilian boats, and more than 30 horses were destroyed. The next day, the Japanese army transported the bodies of the dead soldiers back to Yangzhou in small speedboats and large trucks, and cremated them outside Fuyunmen. The Japanese Army's Attempt is Equal to a Dream. Unexpectedly, after suffering this serious blow, the Japanese army's lucky heart was not completely dead. On the 11th and 12th, they continued to harass and bombard constantly. The Chinese army moved its troops to defend the new position of Lotus Pond, more than ten miles north of Zhaoguan Dam, because the Zhaoguan Dam position was destroyed by bombing and there was no danger to defend. The Chinese and Japanese armies confronted each other. The Japanese army repeatedly tried to build a highway to the north, but the Chinese army's security Zhang regiment sent teams to constantly attack and destroy it. Now Chinese reinforcements have arrived one after another to prevent the Japanese army from advancing again. Although Gaoyou is under the threat of Japanese airplanes and artillery, the officials and people are very calm. The shops are still open as usual, and the people are still working as usual, which is rare. Looking at the situation from all sides, the Japanese army's advance into northern Jiangsu originally attempted to open up the Grand Canal and then "sweep" northern Jiangsu, but it is equal to a dream. Now the Chinese army, such as Yu and Miao, are constantly attacking behind the Japanese army. Soon, the green gauze tent will rise, and the regular army will cooperate with the guerrillas to attack the Japanese army everywhere. The recovery of counties such as Zhunsi is really not a problem.</p>

<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Zhouzhuang Town, which belongs to the county, is surrounded by water on all sides and is a strategic point on the Suzhou-Shanghai waterway. The Japanese often stationed a large army in the town. Recently, due to the frequent tightness in Wuxi, Jiangyin and other places, the Japanese army transferred most of the soldiers in the town to Xicheng, leaving only more than 200 to garrison. Although the Japanese army relies on the surrounding bunkers and can defend firmly, it is ultimately due to the small number of people, which leads to a state of panic. On the 2nd of this month, it was learned by the Chinese mobile force stationed in Chenmu Town that the Japanese army was empty. That night, the team leader Wang Shaomin led soldiers × 100 people to attack the town, surrounding the Japanese army on all sides. The Japanese army immediately responded in a panic. Wang's troops lay in ambush in the fields, relying on natural protections to severely attack the Japanese army. The two sides fought fiercely for a night. When it dawned on the 3rd, the Japanese army was finally defeated and the town was occupied. The Japanese army's defenses were destroyed. Captain Wang led his troops back to Chenmu safely because the goal had been achieved. In addition to killing ten Japanese soldiers, three were captured. Wang's troops only lost one chief, Zhang Hongcai.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Steel Raw Materials Worth Millions Are All Shipped to Japan <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: The steel plant set up in the suburbs of Shanghai was invested by the government with millions of dollars. All the raw materials for steelmaking, estimated at more than 4,000 tons, were worth more than one million yuan. Since the Chinese army moved west, large and small barges were used to completely transport them all, and they were stored in the Yongye Crushed Stone Plant in Tianma Mountain, which belongs to Songjiang County. The preservation is very strict, and Tianma Mountain is located in a remote area, with only one or two rivers that can pass during high tide. On the land side, the roads are all narrow and winding paths within a dozen miles of the highway and railway, and heavy vehicles cannot travel. Therefore, transportation is inconvenient. Since Songjiang fell, in addition to occupying the important transportation strongholds along the Huangpu River and the railway and highway, the Japanese did not pay attention to Tianma Mountain and the surrounding villages and mountainous areas because the terrain was not important and the transportation was inconvenient, and they did not send troops to garrison. There are shameless people who saw the benefits and forgot the righteousness, and went to report to the Japanese army. On March 14, the Japanese sent a large team of Japanese troops to Songjiang to meet with 200 to 300 puppet troops from Songjiang. Han traitors led them to carry more than a dozen small speedboats, equipped with small steel cannons, heavy machine guns, and light machine guns, and went to Tianma Mountain. First, they searched the people. The security team stationed there was less than 100 people, and the difference between the number of people was too great to resist. Now the Japanese and puppet troops are stationed in the Yongye Crushed Stone Plant. First, they forcibly captured more than 100 ships from the people, and forcibly pulled hundreds of villagers, ordering the villagers to transport the steel stored in the plant within ten days, regardless of day or night, and send it to Songjiang Station, load it on trains, and transport it to Shanghai, and then transport it to Japan. The traitors are unscrupulous, which is very sad.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 8th) was the 43rd anniversary of the establishment of Jiaotong University. Therefore, at 5 p.m., the anniversary ceremony was held in the auditorium of the YMCA in Baixianqiao, and an honorary doctorate of laws degree was awarded to Yan Deqing on behalf of Lehigh University of the United States. More than 200 Chinese and foreign guests, including Hu Dunfu, He Dekui, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and faculty and students of the school, attended. Because the time was extraordinary, the ceremony was very simple, and the atmosphere was solemn. At the beginning of the meeting, President Li Zhaohuan reported that the school was established in the 23rd year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty. At first, it was only a normal school. Through years of expansion, it now has five colleges, ten departments, and six courses. In terms of quality and quantity, although it cannot be compared with advanced schools in Europe and the United States, it has the scale of a modern university. Over the years, thousands of students have graduated, and they have all been able to work hard in the engineering and transportation sectors. In this process of building a new China, graduates of the school have made many contributions. At this time of serious national crisis, the faculty and students of the Shanghai, Ping, and Tang colleges of the school have experienced many hardships due to the relocation of the school site, but they have worked hard and become more interested in birds. Today is the 43rd anniversary of the establishment of the school. It is appropriate that Lehigh University of the United States awarded Yan Deqing an honorary doctorate of laws degree. It specifically commissioned the school to represent it, so it held a ceremony today to award the diploma to Dr. Yan, and used it to commemorate the painstaking efforts and difficult management of the school's office staff for the past 43 years, and to make the faculty and students feel more deeply the importance of the responsibilities they bear and to encourage themselves. Furthermore, the school is fortunate to have the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life in China and abroad during this extraordinary period, so that it can continue to study without interruption. Thank you very much for this. I hope to give more guidance in the future.</p>
<p>Then Zhang Zongyuan, an alumnus of the school, gave a congratulatory speech. After the speech, the ceremony of awarding the honorary doctorate degree to Yan was held. First, Zhang Tingjin, Dean of the College of Engineering of the school, introduced Yan on behalf of Su Cailun, Chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering of Lehigh University. Then Principal Li awarded the certificate on behalf of the President of Lehigh University, Yan delivered a reply, and finally Chu, the Dean of the Sino-French Institute of Technology, and Grosso, the Director of the Education Department of the French Concession, spoke and dispersed.</p>
<p>In addition, the President of Lehigh University said in his speech, "Yan Deqing has made contributions to the motherland, and added glory to the alma mater. He has served in the railway industry for many years, and has made outstanding achievements in both engineering and management." Su Cailun, Chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering of Lehigh University, said in his speech, "Mr. Yan graduated from Lehigh University in 1901 with excellent grades. After returning to China, he served as a railway engineer and director of the administration. He has made great achievements in the country and his reputation is well-known. Mr. Yan was the first Chinese student to graduate from Lehigh University. He obtained a degree in civil engineering in 1901 and then worked in the American Bridge Company for one year. After returning to China, Mr. Yan devoted himself to the railway business for ten years, and was promoted from railway assistant engineer to chief engineer, and was sent to Sichuan to serve. In 1912, Mr. Yan was appointed Director of the Railway Administration of the Ministry of Communications, and then served in various important positions in the Ministry of Railways. He once represented the Ministry of Railways to Europe and the United States to discuss military issues. The Chinese government, in view of Mr. Yan's outstanding achievements, has repeatedly awarded him to comfort his hard work. Lehigh University is also proud to have cultivated such outstanding talents. All faculty and staff members have passed a resolution to remotely award Mr. Yan an honorary doctorate of laws degree because of his dedication to the country and his alma mater. This kind of honorary degree award is only the second time in the history of the university. Yan Deqing, a graduate of Lehigh University in 1901, has made special contributions to the engineering community and added glory to the alma mater. I especially represent all the faculty and staff members to present you with the honorary doctorate of laws degree."

<p>The Jingjiang Middle School Anniversary Celebration was originally scheduled to be held on April 1, but it was changed to the 7th at the school on Xinzha Road due to rainy weather. More than 300 school directors, students' parents, and guests attended. The meeting was held at 2 p.m., and the ceremony was performed. Principal Zhang Haicheng gave an opening speech, saying that the school has been established for two weeks, and it had previously acquired more than 290 acres of land in Zhenjiang and raised a large amount of money. It was in the process of building an ideal school when it was suspended due to the current situation. In order to cultivate talents for the country, to protect the integrity of teachers, and to provide relief to young people who have lost their studies, fortunately, the school directors in the financial circles of Zhenjiang and Shanghai have enthusiastically assisted and have remained unwavering, so they can resume classes in Shanghai. Because the rent in Shanghai is extremely high, the school's administrative income is not enough to cover the expenses. The school has been resuming classes for nearly a year, and the subsidies have been several thousand yuan. Fortunately, we are running education for education, which we do not count, and the enthusiasm and assistance of the school directors is really commendable. He also explained the significance of holding the school anniversary in the national crisis, the process of setting up the school in Zhenjiang, and the future plan after moving to Shanghai. School directors Yan Huanyu, Chen Miancai, Bao Mingshu, and others successively gave speeches, all praising Principal Zhang's enthusiasm for running the school. It is hoped that this sincere and tireless spirit will continue to advance without limit. Student representative Gong Da'e gave a congratulatory speech. Teachers and students presented souvenirs (students had a clock, a school sign, and a "Reflect on Yourself" standing mirror, and the teachers had a "Remember the Source of Water" teapot). The chairman gave a thank you speech, and the students sang the school song. The concert began, and the Chinese music programs included Chinese music ensemble, Kunqu Opera, Pipa solo, Qin Xiao ensemble, etc. for eight performances. Western music programs included trumpet solo, piano performance, male and female soprano solo, violin solo, and piano, flute, clarinet, cello, and four-army ensemble, etc., also for eight performances. Everyone contributed their talents, and applause rose from time to time. The guests enjoyed themselves to the fullest, and dispersed until dusk.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Full Text of Resolutions of the Third National Education Conference (3) - Higher Education Improvement Plan (Part 1) <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— (A special reporter from Shen Bao, Yisheng, mailed from Chongqing by air)</p>
<p>The Higher Education Improvement Plan passed by the National Education Conference is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the establishment of higher education in our country, it has developed the fastest, and since the outbreak of the war, it has suffered the most damage. However, higher education bears a heavy responsibility for the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. All facilities should be improved in response to the needs of the times. The matters that should be improved are proposed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Rationalization of the Establishment of Schools and Departments 1. The Ministry of Education should consider the population, economy, culture, and other conditions in various places, and divide the country into several university education zones. Each zone should have at least one university, and each university must also be responsible for studying social culture and production and construction issues in the region.</p>
<p>2. Each normal college district should have one normal college, and each normal college must also be responsible for researching and guiding secondary education in the region.</p>
<p>3. General and vocational schools of agriculture, industry, commerce, and medicine should be set up comprehensively at appropriate locations. Each school should be closely linked with agricultural, industrial, commercial, and medical colleges of universities in neighboring areas, and with production enterprises and agencies, and should also guide higher and elementary vocational schools in the region.</p>
<p>4. Agricultural, industrial, and medical colleges should be added. In principle, each province should set up one as needed. The number of places in existing agricultural, industrial, and medical colleges should be expanded, and agricultural, industrial, medical, and pharmaceutical specialties should be added as appropriate to create a grand future.</p>
<p>5. Repeated and unnecessary colleges and departments in the same region should continue to be adjusted.</p>
<p>6. There are many colleges and universities above the junior college level in the southwestern provinces that have moved in from the war zones. The number has suddenly increased. After the end of the War of Resistance, there should be a comprehensive rectification plan for these schools. During the War of Resistance, except for those that are overly duplicated, they should be merged as appropriate, and the rest will be temporarily allowed to be set up as usual. However, schools in the same region should have practical cooperation in terms of curriculum setting, equipment use, and teacher distribution in order to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>7. The establishment of private colleges and universities should be restricted or rewarded depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Since arriving in Shanghai, the Canadian School of Kobe has competed against the American School Giants three times, winning all three games. Last night at 8:30 PM, they played an exhibition match against the Jinan team, the champion of the Shanghai school basketball league, at the gymnasium of the American School on Avenue Petain. Because the Canadian School's technique was ordinary, there were not many spectators, only a few dozen. As a result of the match, Jinan lived up to expectations and broke the Canadian School's unbeaten record in Shanghai with a score of 30-22, which was a masterpiece. Before the game, there was a women's game between Qixiu and the American School, which Qixiu also won by defeating the American School 43-39.

<h3 id="e51">Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Left Shanghai for Chongqing Yesterday, Sir Robert Clive to Return to Japan, Clive Held Two Meetings With Japanese Officials, Conversations With Both Ambassadors Were Said to Be Important <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, took advantage of his vacation to come to Shanghai and meet with Sir Robert Clive, the British Ambassador to China, to discuss and review the general situation in the Far East and Britain's future policy towards the Far East for several days. It was learned yesterday that the meeting had come to an end. Ambassador Clive left Shanghai for Hong Kong yesterday to transfer to Chongqing to discuss Sino-British diplomatic affairs with the Chinese government authorities. Ambassador Clark Kerr also took the Japanese ship Terukuni Maru from Shanghai back to Japan. This meeting of the two ambassadors, which attracted the attention of various parties in Europe and Asia, ended yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Officials Held Two Receptions</p>
<p>After Ambassador Clark Kerr arrived in Shanghai, he invited Chinese gentry Yu Qiaqing, Xi Yushu, and others to dine with him, and Ambassador Clive invited Japanese Embassy Counselor Morishima and Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Miura to meet with Clark Kerr at a banquet. Later, on the 7th at noon, Japanese officials from the foreign, naval, and army sides in Shanghai jointly hosted Ambassador Clark Kerr and Ambassador Clive. The Japanese participants included Counselor Morishima, Lieutenant General Nomura, Lieutenant General Kita, Sato, Major General Sakurai, Lieutenant Colonel Utsunomiya, and other officials. It is understood that these two meetings between Japanese officials and Ambassador Clark Kerr were of a reception nature and did not mention any specific issues.</p>
<p>Clark Kerr Returns to Japan After the Talks</p>
<p>After completing his mission of meeting with Ambassador Clive, Ambassador Clark Kerr, accompanied by his wife and Air Force Colonel Blunt, took the Terukuni Maru from the Bund wharf at 6:00 AM yesterday (8th) and set sail for Japan and then Tokyo to take up his post. Ambassador Clive and the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Phillips, and others went to the wharf to see him off. Before leaving, Ambassador Clark Kerr sent a letter to the Tokyo Embassy, informing them of his itinerary. It is not yet determined whether Clark Kerr will stay in Yokohama.</p>
<p>Issued a Statement Saying There Was No Mission</p>
<p>Before leaving for Japan yesterday morning, British Ambassador to Japan Clark Kerr issued a statement to foreign reporters, stating that he had taken this vacation to come to Shanghai to visit the British Ambassador to China in order to exchange views on issues of mutual concern. He had long wanted to come to Shanghai during his term of office. His predecessor always took the route through Shanghai to Japan, but only he himself took the route through Canada to Japan, so he had no opportunity to come to Shanghai. His trip had no political significance and no mission. It was also unrelated to Ambassador Clive's trip to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Clive to Visit Various Authorities in Chongqing</p>
<p>After seeing off Ambassador Clark Kerr, Sir Robert Clive, the British Ambassador to China, took the Taiyuan ship to Hong Kong at 12:30 PM yesterday (8th) due to ongoing negotiations on Sino-British diplomatic affairs. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned yesterday that Clive's itinerary is scheduled to transfer to Haiphong after arriving in Hong Kong, take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming, and then take a plane from Kunming to Chongqing to visit the Chinese government authorities. The duration of his stay in Chongqing has not been scheduled, but it is expected to be about a week before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Conclusions of the Meeting Were Not Superficial</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency also learned from people familiar with international affairs that Clark Kerr's visit to China and his meeting with Ambassador Clive had expressed deep concern about Britain's past and future trade situation in the Far East when they met with British businessmen in Shanghai. It is widely believed that his meeting with Ambassador Clive was related to Britain's future policy towards the Far East. Although the stay was only three or four days, the conclusions reached were of considerable value. Therefore, Clark Kerr's trip is related to Britain's future Far East policy and is by no means superficial. The British government is now waiting for the real report after the meeting between the two ambassadors.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Japanese Tighten Searches in Hongkou, Threatened by Two Fires <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Telegraph Office between Xihua Road and Tiantong Road in Hongkou was nearly destroyed by fire at 5:10 AM on the 6th. The Japanese Telegraph Office's back road is Fude Road, which has three empty houses very close to the Telegraph Office. Tens of thousands of bales of cotton, looted by the Japanese in the guerrilla zone, were stored in the houses. At 5:10 AM on the morning of the 6th, a fire suddenly broke out. The fire was very fierce and the smoke was thick. It was about to spread to the Japanese Telegraph Office when the Japanese sounded the alarm and sent vehicles to put out the fire. As a result, all three buildings were burned to the ground, but the Japanese Telegraph Office was fortunately unharmed. According to the Japanese, this action was a planned act of sabotage by Chinese terrorists, attempting to burn down the Telegraph Office, similar to the burning of the godowns on Huangpu Road some time ago. They also admitted that a large number of "terrorists" were hiding in Hongkou. Therefore, in recent days, the search and interrogation of residents and Chinese entering and leaving the area have been stricter than in the past.</p>

<p>The newly appointed French Ambassador to China, Cosme, after arriving in Hong Kong, went directly to Chongqing on March 5 to present his credentials to the National Government. He stayed for five days and met with Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, and Foreign Minister Wang. After completing his official duties, he flew from Chongqing to Kunming on the 22nd of last month. After entertaining Chairman Long and others, he transferred to Hanoi to meet with the Governor of Annam, before transferring to Hong Kong. He then took the gunboat "D'Entrecasteaux" to Shanghai. According to reliable sources in the transportation industry, Cosme is scheduled to arrive in the city at 9:00 AM this (9th) morning. The ship will dock at the Taikoo Wharf. The French Consul-General and French business leaders in the city will all be there to welcome him. According to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, Cosme came to China from Europe in 1927 and served in the country's embassy in Peiping. He has always been committed to promoting Sino-French relations. This is his second time in China, and he will further promote relations between the two countries. He has expressed his deep sympathy and eagerness in various places such as Hong Kong and Chongqing.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Japanese Notification to German, Italian, and Other Consulates, Spreading Rumors of an Attack on Eastern Zhejiang, Requesting Notification to Their Respective Nationals to Report Property, Otherwise the Japanese Side Will Not Be Responsible for Any Damage <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>—General Speculation Is That This Move Is Intended to Intimidate—</p>
<p>The German, Italian, and other consulates in this city recently received a notice from Miura, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, spreading rumors that the Japanese army would take action in Eastern Zhejiang, requesting that the commercial property of their respective nationals in Eastern Zhejiang be reported in a list. The consulates then notified their respective nationals to report. As a result, the atmosphere in Eastern Zhejiang became slightly tense again. The resumption of navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo is unlikely to be realized in the short term. The details are reported separately by a reporter from the Modern News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Spreads Rumors of Action</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side has repeatedly carried out harassment along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang, the military authorities of Zhejiang Province, in order to strengthen defense and protect the local area, have mobilized a large army, stationed in various important strongholds, ready to strike at those who strike. At the same time, the Zhenhai Estuary in Ningbo was also approved by the Military Affairs Committee to be closed from the 5th to consolidate the coastal defense. Therefore, the situation in Eastern Zhejiang has eased in recent days, and the situation in various places is extremely peaceful. However, the German, Italian, and other consulates in this city suddenly received a notice from Miura, the Japanese Consul-General, some days ago, spreading rumors that the Japanese army would take action in Eastern Zhejiang, hoping to inform their respective nationals to quickly report in a list the ships sailing in Eastern Zhejiang and all commercial property in Eastern Zhejiang in order to avoid losses. Otherwise, the Japanese side will not be responsible, etc. The German and Italian consulates informed their respective nationals yesterday to report so that they can be forwarded to the Japanese side.</p>
<p>General Speculation Is That This Move Is Intended to Intimidate</p>
<p>Since the above news came out, it has been generally speculated that the Japanese side may take military action in various places in Eastern Zhejiang in the short term, so the atmosphere seems tense again. However, according to news from relevant sources, the Japanese side's move is obviously intended to intimidate. At present, the Chinese armies in various places have unanimously launched a general counter-offensive, and the advance is very smooth. The Japanese army is quite panic, so they are spreading rumors of action in Eastern Zhejiang to show intimidation and attempt to disturb the people in the rear. However, it is widely believed that this move will not be effective, because the Chinese armies in Eastern Zhejiang are all ready to fight, and the people in various places are also united against the enemy. Therefore, there is no reason to cause panic about the Japanese side's move.</p>
<p>The Opening of Zhenhai Is Unlikely to Be Realized for the Time Being</p>
<p>Since the Zhenhai Estuary in Ningbo was ordered to be closed at 3:00 PM on the 5th, the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route has been completely interrupted. All relevant parties believe that the traffic obstruction will have a major impact. Originally, they intended to request the authorities to dispatch ships to restrict navigation in order to maintain traffic. However, according to a reporter from the Modern News Agency who inquired from the shipping industry yesterday, a large number of foreign ships are currently being detained by Japanese warships in the waters of Eastern Zhejiang, and shipping is being harassed. The Japanese consul notified the German, Italian, and other consulates, spreading rumors of action, so they do not intend to request reopening. It is expected that traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo is unlikely to resume sailing in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Ministry of Finance Approves Guangxi Currency to Circulate in Various Provinces, Approves Each Yuan Worth 5 Jiao in Legal Tender, Four Banks Only Exchange as Much as the Rate Allows <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The banknotes issued by the Guangxi Silver Bank were previously approved by the Ministry of Finance to be worth 5 jiao of legal tender. All reserve funds for the issuance of Guangxi currency were also uniformly handed over to the Guangxi Branch of the Issuance Reserve Fund Management Committee for management. Therefore, Guangxi currency and legal tender are now one and the same, without any difference. In order to expand the circulation area of Guangxi currency so that people can carry and use it, the provincial government specially telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to issue a notice to all provinces, stating that Guangxi currency can be circulated in various places at the same exchange rate as legal tender in the future, and ordered the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to exchange Guangxi currency as much as possible at the same exchange rate without restrictions. Now, the Ministry of Finance has approved the electricity to Chongqing, "I understand your instructions regarding the notification that Guangxi currency can be circulated in various places at the same exchange rate as legal tender and that the four banks in various places should exchange Guangxi currency as much as possible at the same exchange rate. Your consideration is thorough and deeply admired. The banknotes issued by the provincial bank in the past and the issuance reserve funds have been received by the Issuance Reserve Fund Management Committee. The issuance of subsidiary currency notes has been deposited in accordance with the regulations. During this extraordinary period, when they flow out of the province, they should be accepted and used by the four banks in various places as a whole. The Ministry has sent a letter to the joint office of the four banks to forward it to the four banks for implementation. Previously, before the Guangxi currency was received and sorted out by the Preparation Committee last year, the Guangxi provincial troops carried it out of the province for use. The Ministry has notified the branches of the four banks in various places by telephone to allow them to exchange it as much as possible at a ratio of two to one in order to maintain circulation. Now that the Guangxi currency is outside, it can be used at the same rate, and there will be no discrimination. I hope you will pay attention."</p>
<h3 id="e56">Shanghai Stock Exchange Ordered to Prepare for Resumption of Business, Securities, Cloth, Flour, and Grain Exchanges, Will Resume Trading as Soon as Reorganization is Completed <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the resumption of business of the Shanghai exchanges, the various exchanges had previously submitted methods and suggestions to the central government by telegram. After research by the Ministries of Finance and Economy, it has been approved. According to a reporter from the Modern News Agency who inquired from relevant sources, except for the Gold Exchange, which will be postponed, the other four exchanges, such as Securities, Cloth, Flour, and Grain, will prepare to resume trading in the shortest possible time after reorganization. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Suggestions Approved by the Central Government</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the withdrawal of the National Army, the various exchanges in this city had to suspend business one after another due to the harsh environment, waiting for the central government to deal with them. During this period, the puppet "Reform Government" wooed traitors in an attempt to take over and manage them. Fortunately, the various exchanges responded calmly and were not realized. The Ministries of Finance and Economy were quite concerned about the current situation of the various exchanges. In September of last year, they issued a clear order to the various exchanges to find ways to resume business and stipulated three methods: (1) For securities, the price of government bond trading should not be lower than 70%; (2) For cloth, the standard market price and grade of Chinese cloth tickets were specified; (3) For those engaged in general exchange operations, non-industry trading or non-economists shall not participate in transactions. After careful discussion of the above clear order, the various exchanges believed that it was not good, so they jointly discussed a more specific and suitable method for the current situation and submitted it to the central government. After several months, the Ministries of Finance and Economy, in addition to approving the various exchanges to wait for instructions, also submitted it to the Economic and Legal Systems Committee for review. According to a reporter, the central government issued another order at the end of last month, instructing the various exchanges to follow the methods suggested by the various exchanges.</p>
<p>Four Exchanges Prepare to Resume</p>
<p>The Securities, Cloth, Flour, and Grain Exchanges in this city have begun to hold board meetings after receiving the clear order from the Ministries of Finance and Economy. The brokers will also hold a meeting in the coming days to discuss it. As soon as the various exchanges are reorganized, they will prepare to resume business in the shortest possible time. As for the Flour Exchange, which was newly opened on Mingong Road and Xinkai River in the Southern City, its address is in the Chinese area, so it will find a suitable house in the concession or temporarily borrow from another exchange as a market for expedient use.</p>
<p>Gold Exchange Postpones Resumption</p>
<p>Regarding the resumption of business of the Gold Exchange, due to the current tense international situation, the overseas market's gold prices fluctuate high and low, and are unstable. If the Shanghai gold market resumes business, it will inevitably be affected and affected by the international market. Secondly, it is feared that someone will take the opportunity to manipulate and affect finance, so the central government decided to postpone the resumption of business.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens Group Fundraising Committee has launched a refugee relief sponsorship movement, which has been deeply supported by enthusiastic people from all walks of life, and the benefits to the disaster victims are not shallow. The association received a letter from Geng Shou, an overseas Chinese in Saint-Truce, France, and attached 250 French francs to cover the expenses of sponsoring refugees. The original letter said, "I am writing to inform you that I have received your letter of February 23 and a receipt exchange slip, which I have carefully noted. 50 francs can be exchanged for more than 8 yuan in national currency, which can support four refugees. I am very pleased. I am now enclosing three French franc notes, totaling 250 French francs, as donations for February, March, April, May, June, and May. Please check and reply. I will remit money once every six months thereafter until your association ends. If your association has any donation printed matter, please send a few copies so that I can solicit donations from overseas Chinese in Europe and do my best." The Citizens Group Fundraising Committee believes that Mr. Geng is still in France, and he is very concerned about the refugees in the country and has been donating money for a long time. His enthusiasm is admirable. It has checked the sponsorship certificate and receipt and sent a special letter of thanks.</p>

<p>According to people who came from Pudong, on the night of the 5th of this month, a large number of Chinese troops suddenly arrived in Pudong from a certain place.

According to the person in charge of these Chinese troops, they will start to eliminate the puppet army. It is said that these Chinese troops are the Infantry Third Regiment of the Third District Security Team of Jiangsu Province, which is well-known. It is also said that the Kikuchi unit of the Japanese army stationed on Penglai Road in Nanshi was suddenly dispatched last night (7th) to reinforce Pudong. Before leaving, all the military telephones at the various sentry posts were also removed. This situation of the Japanese army may be concentrated in Pudong, with some intention.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Illegal Actions of Japanese Warships: Nine Foreign Vessels Detained and Inspected; Forcibly Steered to the Mouth of the Song River Yesterday Morning and Not Yet Released by Evening; Portuguese Consulate to Lodge a Serious Protest <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>According to sources in foreign shipping circles, nine foreign vessels, including the "Hailong," were detained and inspected by Japanese warships in the waters off Dinghai, Zhejiang Province. Yesterday morning, they were forcibly steered to anchor outside the mouth of the Wusong River. The crew and passengers are safe. The Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai is preparing to lodge a serious protest. The "Meifa," "Tangsai," and other vessels, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou yesterday, have now decided to temporarily suspend their voyages. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Nine Foreign Vessels Suddenly Detained and Inspected</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the navigation routes to eastern Zhejiang have been operated by shipping companies from countries such as Britain, Germany, Italy, and Portugal. For more than a year, there have been no incidents. After the successive blockades of Haimen and Zhenhai, the vessels have all changed their routes to Wenzhou, resulting in more than ten foreign vessels operating there. Recently, three Japanese warships suddenly appeared in the waters off Dinghai. Since the day before yesterday morning, they have been inspecting all vessels on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. Over the past two days, the foreign vessels detained and inspected in the waters off Dinghai include: (1) the "Hailong" of the Portuguese-owned Atlantic Company; (2) the "Meida" of the Portuguese-owned Meili Company; (3) the "Tanglu," represented by the American-owned Huamei Company, all of which sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai on the 6th; (4) the "Tangqiao" and "Tangbei," represented by the American-owned Huamei Company, which sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou the day before yesterday; (5) the "Libao" of the Portuguese-owned Zhengde Company, which sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai on the 5th; (6) also the diesel-powered flat-bottomed boats "Baode," "Dama," "Mime," etc., which also sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai. In total, nine foreign vessels were detained and searched by Japanese warships in the waters off Dinghai.</p>
<p>Forcibly Steered to Anchor at the Mouth of the Song River Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>After receiving the news of the search, the vessels became extremely concerned as they did not receive any further news of release and the time had been long. The respective companies sent telegrams, but received no response, as the radio equipment on each vessel had been monitored by the Japanese and could not send reports. It was not until 8:30 PM the night before last that the Meili Company received a telegram from the owner of the "Meida," stating, "Received notification from the Japanese Navy to return to Shanghai, expected to arrive at Wusong tomorrow (i.e., yesterday)." It is understood that the vessels were steered to the Tongsha waters outside the mouth of the Wusong River yesterday morning around 9 AM under the surveillance of Japanese warships. However, as of 6 PM yesterday afternoon, there was still no news of their release.</p>
<p>Portuguese Consulate to Lodge a Serious Protest</p>
<p>It is understood that the above vessel companies are all purely foreign-owned and operated, and have registered with the consulate and obtained certificates. The reason for this sudden detention and inspection by Japanese warships is very perplexing. The companies immediately reported the situation to the Portuguese Consulate-General in Shanghai and requested negotiations. After receiving the report, the consulate considered the situation to be serious and immediately made oral representations to the Japanese consulate. However, the Japanese consulate claimed that this was a matter for the navy and that the consulate had not received a report and therefore could not express an opinion. The Portuguese consulate has now decided to prepare a serious protest to ensure the navigation rights and interests of Portuguese merchants in China.</p>
<p>Crew and Passengers Are All Safe</p>
<p>After the news of the vessels being detained reached Shanghai, the families of the passengers and crew were extremely concerned about their safety and inquired with the respective companies. Subsequently, the "Tangqiao" and other vessels telegraphed that the vessels were temporarily anchored outside the mouth of the Song River, and the officers and passengers on board were all safe and had not been subjected to any alarm. It is also understood that the vessels were all equipped with emergency rations (note: these rations are prepared for use in the event of unexpected circumstances at sea), so there is no problem with food for the crew and passengers. It is expected that after the Portuguese consulate's negotiations, the vessels will all be able to return to Shanghai safely.</p>
<p>"Meifa" and Other Vessels Temporarily Suspend Sailings</p>
<p>The "Meifa" of the Meili Company and the "Tangsai" of the Huamei Company were originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Wenzhou yesterday. However, due to the sudden detention and inspection of the "Tangbei," "Meida," and other vessels in the waters off Dinghai, the reason for which is unknown, and repeated telegrams have not received news of their release, it has been decided to temporarily suspend sailings and wait for the vessels to arrive in Shanghai before jointly deciding on a course of action. In addition, the "Shantai" of the Portuguese-owned Zhengde Company, because it was not registered in Wenzhou, took the opportunity to enter a dock for repairs after the Ningbo River was blockaded. The "Hana" of the German-owned Far East Company has also temporarily suspended sailings due to hull repairs.</p>
<p>"Feikang" and Other Vessels Arrive Safely in Wenzhou</p>
<p>The "Feikang" of the German-owned Lulin Yangxing sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the morning of the 6th. At 4 PM that afternoon, when it sailed to the waters off Dinghai, it was suddenly fired upon three times by a Japanese warship. Fortunately, it was not hit. The vessel continued to sail and telegraphed the Shanghai company to report the incident. The company subsequently received a telegram from the shipowner, Mr. Kebei, stating that the vessel had arrived safely in Wenzhou. Also, the "Baoli" of the Italian-owned Huayi Yangxing, which sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 5th, has also been telegraphed as having arrived safely in Wenzhou. Furthermore, the "Deping" of the Italian-owned company and the "Moufu" of the German-owned company, which sailed to Wenzhou the day before yesterday, both arrived in Wenzhou one after another last night and will return to Shanghai within days after unloading their cargo.</p>
<p>Report of "Pelleto" Detained Is Inaccurate</p>
<p>Furthermore, yesterday morning, it was widely rumored in this city that a large Italian vessel with the CIN mark was also detained among the foreign vessels detained in the waters off eastern Zhejiang. After inquiries by the reporter of the Modern News Agency, it was learned that in addition to the "Baoli" which had already arrived in Wenzhou, there was also the "Pelleto" which sailed to Fuzhou the day before yesterday. Subsequently, according to news from the company, the vessel has already arrived in Fuzhou, so the rumor of its detention is actually inaccurate.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Collectively Discuss Effective Response</p>
<p>Shipowners from Portugal, Germany, and other countries in this city believe that the search and detention of a large number of vessels in the waters off eastern Zhejiang and the shooting at German vessels indicates that the Japanese side is deliberately obstructing the shipping of various countries and squeezing out legitimate shipping businesses. In addition to separately reporting to their respective consulates-general in Shanghai and lodging strong protests, they also plan to collectively discuss effective response measures and request their respective governments to provide them with firm guarantees.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Japanese Puppet Regime Attempts to Revise the North China Customs Tariff Again; Intends to Reduce Import Duties on Japanese and "Manchukuo" Goods; Also Plans to Abolish the Customs Gold Unit <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," the Japanese government and the "Provisional Government" of Peiping are currently holding economic conferences in Tokyo to consider revising the North China customs tariff. The economic delegation of the Peiping regime is led by the "Ministers of Finance and Economy" and went to Japan a few days ago to discuss ways to further strengthen economic ties between Japan, "Manchukuo," and North China. The main method in the plan seems to be to change the North China customs system, especially to reduce import duties on a large number of goods, such as raw materials, agricultural products, machinery, chemicals, medicines, and objects "necessary for the development of North China." It is a matter of course that most of these reduced import duties are for goods that Japan and "Manchukuo" import to North China in large quantities. According to a statement in Peiping, the "Reformed Government" established a special committee some time ago to prepare for another adjustment of North China customs. The committee will submit its report with various recommendations, one of which will advocate the abolition of the customs gold unit and the adoption of a new permanent customs exchange rate. This exchange rate will be roughly based on parity with the Japanese yen. Regarding this point, the Peiping puppet also admits that there is a need to consult with Western countries, but it does not intend to delay changing the North China system until such consultations have begun or produced results. In the near future, regardless of possible opposition from European and American countries, it will be ordered to be implemented "under the guise of" temporary transitional "methods."</p>

<p>The Japanese army in the Hongkou district, due to the frequent discovery of patriotic leaflets and slogans supporting the central government and resisting Japan in various places recently, has since the day before yesterday dispatched patrol teams, each consisting of five people, to patrol various roads. The barriers on various bridges remain the same, such as those on North Sichuan Road, Yokohama Bridge, Hanbury Road, Lihong Bridge, Yalu Road, Sikaizi Bridge, and Ou Jia Road New Bridge, all of which are guarded by many Japanese and puppet troops who search vehicles and pedestrians. Their level of fear can be seen in general.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year, the silk factories in western Shanghai, although still operating day and night, have been experiencing a severe shortage of cocoon supplies. Apart from some factories making every effort to purchase supplies in various parts of eastern and western Zhejiang to maintain operations, those unable to purchase supplies have been forced to reduce their operations. Now that the silkworm season has arrived and the spring cocoons are about to enter the market, the silk cocoon business in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been indirectly controlled since the "Central China Company" monopolized it, and all silkworm breeding businesses have also been indirectly subjected to control. In the future, when spring cocoons enter the market, they will inevitably be forcibly purchased. In order to plan ahead, personnel have been dispatched to the interior to place orders. At the same time, they intend to discuss with the Zhejiang provincial authorities and provide as much convenience as possible to the silk factories in Shanghai that go to eastern Zhejiang to purchase cocoons during the spring cocoon harvest season in various counties of eastern Zhejiang.</p>

<p>Since the resumption of the Shanghai-Hefang route of the British-owned Jardine Matheson and Swire companies and the return to calling at Beihai, when Swire's "Suiyang" vessel entered Beihai port on the 22nd of last month, it was forcibly inspected by two Japanese warships dispatched in speedboats, which greatly delayed the voyage. On the 24th, a Japanese armed fishing boat, under the cover of a Japanese aircraft, entered Beihai port and circled the Swire "Jiangsu" vessel, which was berthed there, threatening it, causing the vessel to be unable to load and unload cargo. After anchoring in the Beihai sea area for two days, it sailed to Hefang.</p>

<p>"Special Report from this Newspaper" Since the recent sudden improvement in the Chinese military situation, the response work of guerrillas in various places has also been extremely active. The other day, the tracks near the Lingkou Station between Danyang and Lucheng on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway were destroyed for more than twenty feet by guerrillas, causing a passenger train from Nanjing to Shanghai to be stranded at Zhenjiang Station for as long as four hours. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line was also in a state of emergency. Therefore, traffic on both the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines was suddenly interrupted yesterday. According to extremely reliable sources, the Japanese army has been in a state of extreme panic for days. The other day, the Japanese army moved all 120 passenger and freight cars from the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines to Wusong for concealment, covering them with branches and leaves as camouflage. Yesterday, another 40 cars were moved. This shows the Japanese army's panic and fear.</p>

<p>Sun Bingzhong, Wang Yongchang, Xu Xiangyan, Zhu Daoxin, Yu Guorui, Li Jianliu, Cai Danhan, Gu Shenqi, and sixty other members of the staff and laborers of the Shanghai Grain and Oilcake Exchange located on Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, have retained a lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against the directors and executive committee members of the Exchange, Chen Ziyi, Cai Yukun, Jiang Hongbin, Cao Xingeng, Yang Heqing, She Bingwen, Chen Yuming, Jiang Lansheng, Yin Yucun, and others, requesting mediation, payment of living expenses, and permission for the staff and laborers</p>
<p>to continue to reside. It is claimed that the petitioners have been serving at the Shanghai Grain and Oilcake Exchange. Last year, due to the issue of living expenses, litigation was initiated, and through the mediation of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, an amicable agreement was reached between the two parties in January of this year, with the opposing party paying on a monthly basis. Unexpectedly, payments were suddenly stopped this month, causing the petitioners to face the threat of insufficient food and clothing. They requested mediation to order the opposing party to continue payments as before. Furthermore, a small portion of the staff and laborers and their families are currently residing in the exchange. According to the agreement, they should have moved out by February 18. However, the opposing party's board of directors passed a resolution on January 10 regarding the relocation of exchange staff and the rental of vacant rooms on the third and fourth floors to increase revenue. However,</p>
<p>the staff and laborers residing there are precisely because they have not yet obtained suitable housing, and most of their native homes have been destroyed, leaving them homeless. Therefore, to cater to the opposing party's desire for revenue, they voluntarily offered to contribute to the rent within their means, but the opposing party deliberately made things difficult and could not reach an agreement, causing the residents to feel anxious and insecure. They requested mediation to continue their residence. The court accepted the petition and opened the fourth courtroom for mediation yesterday morning. Only the petitioners and their legal representative were present. The opposing party was absent. After a brief questioning by the judge, it was announced that the mediation had failed and that a formal lawsuit should be filed.</p>

<p>Yang Wenying, a young woman from Anhui province, eighteen years old, whose mother worked as a maid at the Wang residence at 50 Foch Road, Model Village. The young woman came to Shanghai from her hometown at the age of eleven and also lived in the residence as a maid. As the young woman grew older, her appearance became attractive, and a group of young men would frequently try to seduce her. Subsequently, the young woman's behavior gradually became romantic, and she made many friends. As a result, she often went out on various pretexts and did not return until the next day. Because of her affection for her daughter, her mother did not restrain her, and lately, she had become even more unbridled than before. The night before last, she went out again on some pretext and did not return until the next morning. Because of gossip from others, her mother could not bear it any longer and reprimanded her daughter. Unexpectedly, Wenying, out of shyness, used the excuse of going out to burn incense, took a car alone to the Dahuhu Hotel on Dongxin Bridge, opened room 505, and committed suicide by swallowing a gold ring. Later, she used the telephone to contact her close friend and relay the message to her mother. Upon hearing the news, her mother rushed to the Dahuhu to visit. Seeing her daughter looking dejected, she knew that she had swallowed gold and quickly hired a car to rush her to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>News from the News Agency, the prevalence of opium addiction in western Shanghai has been increasing recently. The depth of its harm is greater than floods or fierce beasts. According to reporters' inquiries, its recent practical situation can be roughly divided into two points: (1) The source of opium is now completely controlled by a certain party, which transports it from the Rehe and North China areas and concentrates it in the Hongkou and Zhabei districts to supply opium dealers. (2) The major opium dealers are still Zheng Shishi (Zheng Qiaji Opium Firm), Lin Rongchang, Lan Bason, Zhang Baohua, and others. However, it is now stipulated that those who need to obtain opium from a certain party must be contacted through Zheng's Zheng Qiaji Opium Firm. The required opium is transported by a certain party to the Special Goods Association organized by the Japanese puppet regime, and then distributed by Zheng Qiaji and the other twelve opium firms according to their share. Therefore, Zheng constantly travels to and from the Hongkou area. As a result, the above-mentioned five opium firms also enjoy the most favorable benefits. Under the thirteen opium firms, each has more than ten small opium firms to distribute the goods. Therefore, drug addiction will become increasingly prevalent.</p>

<p>According to the French-language "Shanghai Daily" on the 8th, it was heard that a fairly large gambling den had been opened somewhere on Maiteheshi Road. Yesterday, it was detected by the Public Concession Police, who sent detectives to arrest them. It was heard that the gamblers resisted arrest, so two people were shot at the time and have been sent to the hospital for treatment. The gambling den has now been sealed off.</p>

<p>Yang Xiujuan, a Shaoxing woman who used to work as a female teacher at 6 Wen'anfang, Remi Road, in the French Concession, twenty-six years old this year, recently retained lawyer Tang Hao to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court to stop supporting her widowed sister-in-law, Yang Xu Xiuzhen (thirty-one years old, with two sons, the elder being nine years old and the younger being four years old). It is claimed that the opposing party is the petitioner's widowed sister-in-law. Since her husband's death, the petitioner has temporarily provided food and lodging, and they have lived together. Unexpectedly, the opposing party has a violent and contrary nature, often mistreating her mother-in-law and aunt. Recently, she has been restless, so in accordance with Articles 124 and 125 of the Civil Code, the petitioner should no longer have an obligation to support her.

<p>A woman surnamed Lu from Pudong, who made a living by selling opium, was busy every day but never exposed. The day before yesterday morning, the woman was again doing her daily work, going to the opium base camp at Xinkang Lane, Kangnao Road, in western Shanghai to buy five taels of opium, divided into twenty packets, wrapped in cloth, and tied to her breasts. She took the No. 10 bus at that place. Suddenly, Chinese and foreign detectives, along with female inspectors, boarded the bus to search male and female passengers. The opium she was carrying was seized, and she was taken into custody by the police. The next morning, she was sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Zhong questioned her and sentenced her to six months in prison. If she chose to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, the fine would be calculated at three yuan per day of the prison term. The opium was confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Japanese Soldiers Search Hongqiao Town; Arrest More Than Twenty Youths; Residents of Western Shanghai are Anxious and Uneasy <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Around 2 PM yesterday afternoon, a large contingent of more than one hundred Japanese and puppet soldiers suddenly arrived at Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai, carrying small cannons and machine guns, fully armed, and conducted a large-scale search of the residents of the town and demanded to see the residents' certificates. For a time, the situation was serious, and the residents fled in droves. More than twenty people, including Mao Guixiang, who lived in Henan in the town and opened a grocery store, were accused of being guerrillas for not carrying residents' certificates, and were tied tightly with ropes and sent to the Japanese military headquarters at the Toyoda Spinning Factory in Fanwangdu. It is heard that the lives of those arrested are in danger. Furthermore, around 3 AM the morning before yesterday (the 7th), twenty-six Japanese soldiers in disguise went to the villages of Liujianong, Caojiatang, and Shenjiayan in the western part of Caohaijing Town in western Shanghai and searched every household. All the villagers were awakened from their dreams and mistakenly thought that bandits had arrived, so they sounded the alarm by beating gongs. The guerrillas in that area heard the sound and immediately opened fire as a warning. The Japanese soldiers dared not linger and immediately returned. Unexpectedly, around 2 AM the morning before yesterday, a large contingent of more than</p>
<p>two hundred Japanese and puppet troops, one from Lincoln Road to Hongqiao Town and one from Caohaijing Town to the west along Qinghu Road, led by traitors, surrounded the villages in the Zhangshilang, Wangjiaqiao, and Ligenglang areas in two routes, broke down the doors, entered and searched, overturning boxes and rummaging through chests, behaving like robbers, and forced the villagers to provide information on the whereabouts of the guerrillas. If they were not successful, they would immediately inflict torture. As a result, they gained nothing and returned only around 9 AM yesterday morning. Therefore, in the past two days, the residents of the western Shanghai area have been</p>
<p>anxious and uneasy. (Furthermore, according to news) Recently, the Chinese guerrillas have been very active in the western Shanghai area, with a ghostly presence. The Japanese army has become extremely panicked, dare not travel alone during the day, and the Japanese soldiers stationed along the railway and in various towns dare not step out of their defense areas at night. According to a vegetable seller from Hongqiao in western Shanghai who came to Shanghai yesterday, the Japanese military police headquarters in western Shanghai has been sparing no effort in searching for Chinese guerrillas, selecting</p>
<p>Japanese ronin who understand a little Chinese and disguising them as Chinese farmers and workers, forming teams to search for the whereabouts of the guerrillas. Recently, in the villages within one or two li around Hongqiao Town, there are often groups of three to five Japanese soldiers wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, with aprons tied around their waists, looking like Chinese workers, going to various farmers' homes to inquire and demand to see the residents' certificates. If they encounter young farmers, the interrogation becomes</p>
<p>increasingly strict. If there is a slight discrepancy between the language and the photo attached to the resident's certificate, they will be detained. Therefore, most of the able-bodied men in that area have fled to the concession. (Furthermore, according to news) The Japanese military headquarters in Shanghai, because the Chinese guerrillas in the four suburbs of this city and along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines and Jiabao and other places have been appearing and disappearing unpredictably and repeatedly attacking, making it difficult for the Japanese puppet troops stationed there to cope, in addition to having transferred Japanese and puppet troops to reinforce them, also dispatched a large contingent of Japanese troops yesterday to conduct strict searches of incoming and outgoing boats and land pedestrians in the Beixinjing and Suzhou River and other places. If any discrepancies are found in the passes, the boat people will be detained. In the morning, four civilian boats were detained on the waterway, and two carriers were detained on the land route and taken to the military police headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>Wanhua Lou Restaurant Closes Down: Misappropriation and Embezzlement by Assistant Manager; Defendant Requests Postponement of Trial</p>
<p>Wanhua Lou Restaurant in Zhenjiang, Xiaohua Garden, closed down and declared bankruptcy less than a hundred days after its opening, due to unsustainable losses. Mr. Yang Cheng, a shareholder from Suzhou, has obtained several important accounting books and discovered numerous irregularities during his review. He has filed a criminal lawsuit against Zhang Nanxun and Yan Yixing, the other shareholders and assistant managers, alleging misappropriation and other offenses. He claims that he was persuaded by Zhang and others to invest 10,000 yuan in legal tender as a shareholder on December 5th of last year, but the restaurant declared bankruptcy as early as February 2nd. He listed multiple instances of fraud in the accounting books, such as inflated expenses, embezzlement of deposits, misappropriation of deposits, and misuse of checks, requesting that the defendants be prosecuted according to law. The case was scheduled to be heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Shen Bingrong of the Ji Yi Special District Court. Zhang Nanxun submitted a prior statement requesting a postponement because he needed to go to Jiangbei. Yan Yixing's address was incorrect, so the summons could not be delivered. Therefore, neither defendant appeared at the hearing. Only the plaintiff, accompanied by his attorney, appeared in court with the unstamped accounting books and other evidence. Judge Shen ruled that since both defendants' absence was not intentional, he would adjourn the hearing and reschedule it for a later date.</p>

<p>Seasonal New Product: Lun Chang Printed Fabric</p>
<p>Since Lun Chang non-fading fabric's various new seasonal products have been launched, they have demonstrably gained widespread popularity among customers, truly worthy of being called a surprising contribution of 1939. Lun Chang fabric offers all the patterns that customers need in this season with novel styles that never fade. Not only do people love to use it, but also the price is surprisingly cheap, affordable for everyone.</p>
<p>This year's products include the inexpensive and durable "Lun Fang", the finely striped and vibrant "Ma Sha", and also "Ma Fang", which is especially popular among those on the coast. In addition, there are "Fu Chou" and "Zhou Bu", dyed elegantly and sold cheaply. "Fa Si Ge" fabric comes in twenty-four different colors, elegant and beautiful, and is suitable for making shirts and women's clothing. The cheapest of these is Lun Fang, sold for only 45 cents per yard, while the most expensive, Zhou Bu, sells for only 70 cents per yard. Therefore, for the price of two or three yuan, one can obtain beautiful clothing material. Moreover, the company absolutely guarantees that this kind of clothing material will never fade, even after washing and sun exposure. If customers find that the color fades after purchase, they can exchange it for free at the company.</p>
<p>At this extraordinary time, housewives must practice thrift, but with such low prices, they can buy high-quality clothing material comparable to European and American products. This is something that everyone is satisfied with. Currently, the spring colors are on display at major silk and fabric stores and major companies. The variety of colors allows one to choose freely, with floral, striped, and three-dimensional styles.</p>
<p>All patterns are designed by Lun Chang Textile Printing &amp; Dyeing Company.

Therefore, when Westerners return to their countries, they often buy Lun Chang fabric to take home, which also proves the widespread popularity of Lun Chang fabric.</p>
<p>Cotton fabric is recognized by scientists as the ideal clothing material for summer. Because cotton fabric is cooler than silk in the summer. And since summer clothing is washed and exposed to the sun more often, it must be made of Lun Chang non-fading fabric. Lun Chang fabric is the best choice for preparing new summer outfits. Lun Chang colored fabric becomes more vibrant with washing, with unbelievable durability. Therefore, it is even more suitable for making children's clothing.</p>
<p>To avoid imitations, every two yards is printed with a "Washing Picture Guarantee". Customers should pay attention when buying the material.</p>

<p>"Sha Chi" Not Traded; Sentiment Slightly Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's cash "Sha Chi" grey market conditions, because it was the foreign Qingming holiday, so no members gathered, but a certain gentleman in the money exchange industry said, according to his observation, because the newspaper reported on that day that Italy had implemented an invasion of Albania, so market sentiment was slightly disturbed and uneasy. Based on this, it is speculated that there may be a downward trend at the opening. However, on the other hand, it is inferred that the chips in Shanghai are exhausted. Before the holiday, Hong Kong gangs and foreign merchants searched and purchased quite a bit, and recently merchants have been out of stock, so it is expected that there will be no major problems at the opening. However, today a small number of bulls are intending to sell out at the closing price of 2,068 yuan before the holiday (April 6th), and buyers are willing to absorb it only if it is reduced by seven or eight yuan, but no transactions have been heard. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops has not changed due to the holiday. Da Tong Hang still hangs at the original price of 210 yuan, Xin Tong Hang is 208 yuan, and the purchase price is 202 yuan. The central listing, Customs Gold and Huahai standard gold prices are still flat. The Chinese pure gold buying price is still 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao, because foreign Qingming continues to be on holiday and there is no telegram.</p>

Three hundred bags of Wuhu beans traded at 8.85 yuan and 8.88 yuan. There were only twenty bags of Pudong du beans, with a transaction price of 10 yuan original price.</p>
<p>Today, beans are exported, shipping more than 1,490 bags to Xiamen, and more than 130 bags of sorghum are also shipped to Xiamen.</p>

<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<p>今年茶葉未許樂觀　毛茶價格飛漲　超過珍眉售盤</p>
<p>This Year's Tea Market Not Optimistic; Raw Tea Prices Soar, Exceeding Zhen Mei Sales Prices</p>
<p>The tea market of foreign firms in this city has not had large-scale transactions in the past two weeks. The market price has softened compared to the previous few weeks. The market price of core-removed Zhen Mei has returned to 150-160 yuan. The highest price of ordinary Zhen Mei is no more than 120-130 yuan, and the lowest is in the vicinity of 100 yuan. According to the raw tea prices purchased by the tea factory, they all need to be 80-90 yuan to 130-140 yuan. With such raw tea prices, even if the factory produces the above-mentioned market prices, not only is there no profit to be made, but there is also a risk of折閱. There is still a month before the new tea market. Currently, several new brands are being prepared. According to the expectations of general tea merchants, I am afraid that this year's tea business is not allowed to 覜.</p>

<p>Piece Goods</p>
<p>呢絨門市增旺　疋頭少數有出口</p>
<p>Woolen Retail Business Increases; Few Exports of Piece Goods</p>
<p>Recently, woolen spring sales are in season, and the retail business in the Qipan Street area has increased. Those with a price of one yuan per foot are even more popular, because the economic strength has been reduced after the war. As for Western clothing呢, those with eight or nine yuan a yard are more popular. It is heard that in recent days, the minimum retail business for large and small shops can do more than 300 yuan, and the more profitable ones can do more than 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Today's exports of piece goods include 44 pieces to Xiamen, 70 pieces to Hong Kong, 180 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 85 pieces to Haiphong, 17 pieces to Weihaiwei, and 55 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<p>工商談助為木炭策將來  培本</p>
<p>Business and Industry Discussing Assistance for Charcoal for the Future  Peiben</p>
<p>A month ago: Due to the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, Japanese warships frequently invaded. The authorities, in order to understand the business difficulties, "prepare for a rainy day",疏攻積貨, allowed the export of local products. Therefore, in the past week, as many as 50,000 to 60,000 loads of Wenzhou charcoal arrived, resulting in sufficient inventory in this city and a sharp reduction in进户. General short-term brokers had to贴佣抛出, to资週轉. The supply exceeded demand, and the盤價 decreased daily. Seeing this situation, the Charcoal Company thought it was not a long-term plan and gathered the charcoal industry in this city to organize a "Charcoal Transportation and Sales Office", limiting the暗盤 and unifying the selling price to avoid unexpected losses. As Yongjiang奉電令, Zhenhai is preparing to封鎖 and prohibit航輪 from operating; if the situation turns tense, Wenzhou will also cut off transportation. If so, the source of charcoal will be obstructed. I believe that</p>
<p>(1) Abolish the Freight Deadline The previous reason for the large number of charcoal shipments from the Charcoal Company, reaching as many as 50,000 to 60,000 loads in a week, was that it was difficult for the Shanghai遝銷處 to sell, so it could only be stacked on the栈, and the填本 was too large to bear. Therefore, it was determined that 后货 should be装申 45 days after the previous goods were sold out. Now that something extraordinary has happened, such as the possible封鎖 of Oujiang, this freight deadline should be abolished, and装运 should be urged as soon as possible to avoid the risk of charcoal断档. As for来货填本, you can contact the banking industry to apply for mortgage loans; or seek it from those in the industry with assets, because those within the industry are familiar with the market situation and are more convenient.</p>
<p>(2) The Distribution of 来货 is also very important. Because "物稀为贵", if Oujiang is封鎖, there is no后货, which will inevitably lead to peers猛力吸收, "积谷防荒", and those who are捷足 will be the first to ascend, and those who arrive later will have no goods to supply to the market. Therefore, the 公会 should allocate it fairly, based on the amount of sales on weekdays, and不得垄断独裁, 苦乐不匀. At the same time; it is strictly forbidden for people outside the industry to purchase, because外行 are mostly囤户, aiming to投机居奇, and cannot circulate in the market.</p>
<p>(3) No Arbitrary Price Increases The cost of the charcoal is already stipulated (see the previous news in this newspaper).除酌加佣金,门庄发客不得任意抬价 to increase the burden on the civilians. I then: The Transportation and Sales Office can stop supplying goods; because垄断居奇 not only hurts commercial ethics, but also is not allowed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>油市</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<p>豆油續向高峰邁進　—花生油到湧步穩—</p>
<p>Soybean Oil Continues to Advance to Peak; Peanut Oil Arrivals Surge Steadily</p>
<p>Soybean oil had a two-day holiday and demand inevitably became lively. Therefore, in the state of declining inventory, it moved forward, and prices all saw the latest high. Dalian oil is close to the 40 yuan mark, and its potential is still brewing due to the control problem, and it will inevitably break out of the mark. The futures Japanese merchants still have no clear statement, so there is no solution in sight for the overall situation. Yesterday, more than 400 barrels of spot Dalian oil opened, and the price rose from 38 yuan to 39.6 yuan at the close. 250 pieces of Yanqi oil traded at 29 yuan. Suifeng Factory oil opened at 200 loads at 38 yuan. Peanut oil sources saw an increase and the sales were also slightly active. Also, because the price of soybean oil continued to rise, the market was in good shape. Yesterday, 250 pieces of Jiaozhou oil traded at 32 yuan, slightly up by 5 cents from before the holiday. 2,000 tins of Yantai canned oil traded at 41 yuan. 200 of Tianjin canned oil traded at 39.8 yuan, and 10 buckets of Qingdao barrel oil traded at 44 yuan.</p>
<p>紗花</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>紗價回振之中由來　春初曾一度紊亂</p>
<p>The Reason for the Rebound of Yarn Prices; There Was Once a Period of Chaos in Early Spring</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year's red market, the cotton yarn market has been in a state of不畅 need, disappointing spring sales. In addition, since the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, merchants in the South China area have been threatened by it. As a result, the bulls were discouraged, and the market price showed a 趦趄 unstable phenomenon. As for the囤户 and the financial world, in view of the unfavorable environment, the desire to cut and結之心 emerged spontaneously, and the falling wind was particularly strong. On March 28, rumors started to spread in the market, and people were uncertain and unsettled. The bank's囤货 first broke out, and the market felt more充濫. After that, Nanchang was abandoned, and the hands were worried,脱卸允切. There was a large unstable situation, and sellers continued to come, so the market price had a messy phenomenon for a time. The minimum peak price for the 現货 of 20-count Double Horse Yarn was 363.5 yuan.</p>
<p>大跌後引起實銷</p>
<p>The Sharp Decline Led to Actual Sales</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after the price dropped sharply, it led to the development of actual sales. Hong Kong, Yunnan and other places came to採办 again. The transportation vehicles that the national government purchased overseas have already arrived in China and have been allocated for use. With this, the transportation from Kunming to Chongqing is敏捷, and they are purchasing cotton yarn in large quantities there. With the arrival of actual sales, the market price immediately横跳. As for Chaoshan, they also came to採办 because the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was hindered and stagnated by military influence. Now, they are changed to inland waterway transshipment to Shantou, and the help is also showing signs of improvement. Therefore, in these recent three days, the yarn market, which had been tired and lifeless for a long time, turned from weak to strong, and the highest price once reached 391 yuan. It is estimated that there are several reasons for this rebound in 20-count yarn, as follows:</p>
<p>At the closing price at the end of last year, the上身货 of 10-count coarse yarn was at 294-295 yuan, the中身货 price was at 290 yuan. The上身货 price of 32-count single yarn was around 500 yuan, and the中身 was between 480 and 490 yuan. The price of 42-count double-strand line was in the vicinity of 530-540 yuan. Unexpectedly, since the red market opened, the 念 count yarn has fallen step by step, and the decline of 10-count coarse yarn has been緩, and 32-count single yarn has not only not fallen, but has even advanced. There was once a sharp rise in the market. Not long ago, the Japanese factories had already given up producing this number of cotton yarn. The Chinese factories did not work even if the 20-count yarn was popular at ordinary times, and the囤户 were not暇 and to this unpopular product. Unexpectedly, the Jin帮 from the north suddenly came to purchase, and all the goods on the market were taken away by them. The factory's额子 was also搜罗殆尽 by them. As a result, the market price rose steadily, and only 20-count yarn was lifeless.</p>
<p>華日紗已近軋平</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Yarn Are Nearing Equalization</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese yarn has been affected by the Qingdao exchange轧空. The households who shorted and lost money in Qingdao came to Shanghai to濫拖, so the Japanese yarn and cloth have been rising day and night. A portion of 20-count Chinese yarn has been leveled with Japanese yarn.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Inside the Chao Hui Villa in the Nanshi Area, a Large Cache of Weapons Was Unearthed: Four Boxes of Landmines, Twenty-Seven Boxes of Hand Grenades <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>A large cache of weapons was unearthed in the Nanshi area the other day by the Japanese. Details have been ascertained as follows: at 10:40 AM on the morning of the date in question, the bogus "Nanshi Police Bureau Detective Squad" received a tip from an informant stating that a large cache of weapons was buried near the Wenxing Pavilion of the Guangdong Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road, Luban Road in the Nanshi area, etc. Upon receiving this report, the "squad" immediately reported it to Yoshiota, the Japanese advisor of the bogus "bureau," who immediately dispatched the bogus squad leader, accompanied by six bogus officers, along with four members of the Japanese advisory military police led by Captain Yoshioka, to conduct an inspection. They dug up a large, withered tree next to the Wenxing Pavilion. After excavating the soil to a depth of about one foot, they discovered a burial mound. After further excavation, they discovered four boxes of landmines, each containing six large landmines, and twenty-seven boxes of hand grenades, each containing twenty hand grenades. However, the hand grenades were taken away by Yoshioka. The landmines, due to the fear of danger, were moved to an empty room in the villa, pending re-examination by the Japanese military police, after which they would be moved for destruction, it is said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Jingjiang Public Hall outside the old Ximen Gate in the Nanshi area, an organization for natives of Zhenjiang residing in Shanghai, has a long history and is quite substantial in scale. After the war, the hall suffered considerable losses, and there were still two thousand coffins stored inside that had not been transported out. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the morning of the seventh day of the month, the Japanese troops in the Nanshi area received a report from a Chinese traitor stating that a large cache of weapons was secretly hidden inside. They specially dispatched four Japanese soldiers, accompanied by the traitor and seven ignorant laborers, carrying hoes and axes, to open the coffins for inspection. After ten coffins were pried open, a rifle and seven hundred rounds of rifle ammunition were found in the coffin of a certain woman. The Japanese soldiers believed that weapons were indeed hidden, so they insisted on opening all the coffins for inspection. After the caretakers of the hall requested it, they were temporarily spared, and the Japanese soldiers left in disappointment.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Residents of North Fujian Road Disturbed by Dung Carts: Request the Health Department to Find Ways to Disperse Them, Shorten the Time, and Crack Down on Broken Carts <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The 37th and 15th District Branches of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation jointly sent a letter to the Health Department of the Public Works Department yesterday, which stated: "To whom it may concern, according to the statements made to our Federation by the shops on North Fujian Road, because this road is close to the Suzhou Road dung wharf, dung carts are passing continuously from 4:00 AM to 11:00 AM, almost turning the road into a thoroughfare for dung carts. As a result, pedestrians mostly detour, causing intangible losses to businesses. Moreover, many dung carts are broken, causing leakage all over the ground. Accumulating bit by bit, the foul odor lingers for a long time, causing great harm to the hygiene of the residents. Please find ways to eliminate this situation. Since the location of the dung wharf is designated by the Public Works Department in a suitable place, it is difficult to change. However, the routing of the dung carts could be dispersed to various roads, the time could be shortened, and broken carts should be banned, so that businesses are not particularly disadvantaged on North Fujian Road alone. We hereby request your department to investigate and immediately disperse the routing of the dung carts and crack down on broken vehicles, for the benefit of the residents and the public good."</p>

<p>The area between Zhejiang Road and Zhifu Road in the Public Concession, commonly known as Stealing Chicken Bridge, is a place where, whenever the lights come on, countless powdered and rouged young women can be seen standing on the streets, soliciting customers in soft voices, or leaning on doors, smiling and beckoning for their patrons. Therefore, although it is known as a place of pleasure, it is actually a hell on earth. The life stories of the people here are mostly tragically inhumane. No. 4 Zhifu Road is this type of hidden den, also known as a pheasant prostitute's house. Among them is a pheasant prostitute named Wang Suolan, just twenty years old, who has been receiving customers in this house for a long time, dealing with both regular and new patrons, and suffering the hardship of being trampled upon. However, she thought that her youth was fleeting, and she thought about choosing someone to marry. It is said that a fruit vendor had a close relationship with Wang and had plans to redeem her from prostitution. However, due to numerous twists and turns, the dream had not come true. The evening before last, the fruit vendor went to Wang's place for pleasure again. At that time, because he was a regular customer, the other prostitutes did not pay attention. Until yesterday morning, the madam of the house saw that neither of them had gotten up, and when she called for Wang, there was no response for a long time. She became very suspicious and pushed the door open to look inside. She was shocked to scream because both men and women were already lying stiff in a pool of blood, dead for a long time. The madam was extremely anxious and immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. They discovered that the throats of both men and women had been slashed with sharp blades and died. The two corpses were sent to the morgue for autopsy, and an investigation was launched to find out the truth, so as to handle the case.</p>
