<h3>荷蘭與比利時</h3>
<p>目前歐洲西綫的大戰還沒有發作，但是北海邊上荷蘭比利時兩國的中立却已遭遇嚴重威脅。如果這兩國果眞因爲中立被人破壞而不得不加入戰爭漩渦，那事實上就等於西綫大戰的發作，歐洲戰局從此就要轉入另一階段了。所以荷比兩國的問題，實在是歐洲戰局目前關鍵所在。照這幾天的形勢看起來，似乎荷蘭問題還要比比利時問題嚴重一點，但是兩國的環境大體相同，決不會一國發生問題而另一國可以置身事外的。</p>
<p>離開今天還不過六天，即本月六日的晚上，比利時國王利奧波德三世率同外交部長斯巴克到達荷蘭首都海牙，會見荷女王威廉明和外長克萊芬，討論國際時局。當時各方消息已傳說有大隊德國衝鋒隊集中於荷蘭邊境，携有大量的坦克與戰車；所以觀察家就認爲「比荷兩國君主在海牙的會晤，由於兩國當局感覺了捲入戰爭漩渦的危機所致」。果然相隔一晚，荷比兩國王就聯名通電給英法德各交戰國，表示願意斡旋歐洲和平。這種微弱的呼聲當然不會發生什麼效力的；而且英法兩國的報紙立即指出：「此乃德國政府最近以更大之威脅加諸西北各鄰邦所致；」「德國業已在外交上以極大壓力加諸比荷兩國，並以軍事的威脅輔之；」「比荷兩國的元首，乃以苦悶之語音發出呼籲」；「兩國元首所努力，要在轉移兩國所受之危機而已。」這樣看起來，荷比兩國的呼籲和平，祇是威脅嚴重之下，毫無辦法的吶喊；在事實上，這種呼徽根本並不能解除自身所遭受的難關。於是荷蘭境內突然發生所謂「制服」案，德國又發生一件被英法報紙疑爲與國會縱火案同樣神秘的慕尼黑大炸彈案，德荷邊境上再發生了關員衝突愴殺案。這種意外事件的接踵而起，正顯示着荷蘭國己臨到了九月一日　夕波蘭國同樣的危機。當然比利時並沒有脫離威脅，不過同是池角，遭殃或許有先後之分，目前就是先輪到荷關罷了。</p>
<p>照目前的形勢看來，德國在這回戰局裏無論如何是利在速戰速決。假使不問國際是非，外交利害，祇就軍事的戰略而言，西綫大戰不發作則已，若要發作，則德國勢必假道於荷比兩國。上决的歐戰，德軍的主敵是法國，故假道比國攻法；但是這一回却兩國有同被假道的可能，而且荷蘭在德方的軍略上地位還更重要一點，因爲這决希特勒的主敵是英國，荷蘭的海岸與陸地，更適宜於作爲對英攻擊的海軍空軍根據地；並且荷蘭的防禦力量並不堅强，荷比之間並不設防，從荷蘭轉道此國側攻法國，還要比直接攻比國便利一點。因此種種，推想德國將因便利自身的作戰而不惜蹂躪兩國的中立，尤其亟亟覬覦荷蘭。</p>
<p>荷蘭一向對國際間保持中立政策，比利時尤其是國際間公認的永久中立國（一九三六年十月，比國已重行宣佈恢復中立國地位），但是如果別國不尊重他們的中立，他們也必然地被迫加入戰爭漩渦。目前兩國都急於作種種防禦的準備，尤其是荷蘭，已經決定決提灌水，佈置他的「洪水陣地」，犧牲之大，自不必說，即此可見決心抵抗侵凌。兩國形勢岌岌，終於能否避免戰爭，惟視德國是否能夠放棄假道的企圖；德國要假道，兩國必參戰。因爲比利時是先天性的英法方面的與國；荷蘭對英法的關係雖不如比國那樣的密切，但是却另有不能不對德抵抗的原因。</p>
<p>荷蘭是目今二等國家中唯一擁有廣大殖民地的國家。荷蘭本國面積三萬多方公里，人口八百餘萬人；但是殖民地面積二百另四萬方公里，大於其本國六十二倍，人口六千一百萬，多於其本國七倍有餘。所以荷蘭一向就靠着殖民地的給養，殖民地是荷蘭的生命。荷蘭的殖民地大部分在太平洋與印度洋之間，小部分在南美洲，和英法等國的殖民地境域相接；在歷史上荷蘭的殖民地旣已大部分被英國所奪，在現勢上史不能不和英國保持相當的睦誼，以便保存現有的殖民地。上决歐戰中，荷蘭所以不參加德國方面寗可保守中立，那關鍵就在於此。這一回歐戰的形勢和前次反正還是大同小異的。荷蘭如果容許了德國假道，就等於加入了德國方面，他生命所繫的海外殖民地有喪失於俄頃的可能。</p>

<h3>今日全市縣旗　熱烈慶祝總理誕辰　兩租界實施通常戒備　各界擴大徵募寒衣金</h3>
<p>今日爲國民黨先總理孫中山先生誕辰紀念、各界以時值非常、故並不鋪張慶典、亦不舉行任何儀式、惟爲追念總理大無畏革命精神、與締造共和之豐功偉績起見、決依照各團體與兩租界當局商定辦法、於今日一律懸旗一天、以資慶祝、而示崇敬、各界熱心人士、更勵行節約運動並擴大征慕寒衣代金、藉以慰勞前綫將士、及救濟被難同胞、</p>
<p>銀錢兩業明日補假</p>
<p>依照國府規定革命紀念節辦法、各機關團體學校、今日均休假一天、以誌慶祝、惟今日適值星期、各界均循例休假、並以時值非常、明日不再補假、但銀行業公會暨錢業公會所屬各會員行莊、仍於明日補行休假一天、至其他如江海關郵政局各級法院等、則均照常辦公、</p>
<p>租界實施通常戒備</p>
<p>兩租界響務當局、以今日爲總理誕辰、故決實施臨時戒備一天、以防止界內發生意外事件、已通飭各捕房加派探捕巡邏各路、搜查行人車輛、施行臨時之通常戒備、昨日起、裝甲車即加緊梭巡、法租界警務處且於昨日上午、搜查法國公園等處、兩租界警務人員、今日亦照常供職、以備臨時差遣、</p>
<p>四郊日軍無形戒嚴</p>
<p>上海四郊、昨晨起宣佈無形戒嚴、因今日爲孫總理誕辰紀念、四郊邊區與鄰近各縣、風聲緊急中國流動部隊潛伏人數、亦日有增加、連日晝夜出沒、調動忙碌、誠恐在此偉大紀念日、向市區作光榮之襲擊、以資慶祝、故日方不得不從事防範、各處要道站崗之日兵、較平時特多、對平民出入、大道警察亦由日方授意搜查加緊、以防持有武器者混入、平民深居簡出、街道上備極蕭條、至浦江東西交通、並未封鎖、</p>
<h3>四郊華軍不斷襲擊　日軍緊張萬狀　兩路貨車半數運兵　日機西飛聶炸偵察　虹口昨架設臨時軍用電話</h3>
<p>京滬滬杭兩路、自被日方佔用後、所有兩路客車、每日各對開二班、貨車則視貨物之多寡而派調、平均每日約有四十輛到到滬、自本月八日起、日軍因各地游擊隊活躍、會向各地抽調兵士、用貨車裝運、以故連日所到貨車、僅約二十輛左右、錫嘉松蘇各地米糧、來滬亦發生阻碍、到貨頓形銳减、自八日起、每日到米數量極少、較平日的减少一倍之多、因此米價飛漲、</p>
<p>龍華莘莊砲聲清晰</p>
<p>華方正規軍及忠義救國軍自奉向滬郊挺進以來、經與各該處游擊隊取得密切聯絡、不時向日軍進襲、出奇制勝、每多重大收穫、惟近日寶山羅店川沙南匯一帶、漸趨沉寂、而龍華閔行莘莊一帶、則轉呈活躍、據滬西來人談、自本月七日起、每至深晚二時至四時、及大將黎明時、均能聞得淸晰之砲聲、及機關槍聲、白天則因人聲噪雜、故無從聽聞、此當係游擊隊於黑夜進攻、發生戰爭使然</p>
<p>日機多架西飛偵察</p>
<p>昨日上午十時三十八分、有日本重轟炸機八架、分成三隊、自大塲飛機塲起飛、向西飛行、下午二時十分、又有日本偵察機三架、亦自東方向西飛經租界、而其方向未有變更、證之滬西槍砲聲、則日軍當係從事偵察華軍之行動、</p>
<p>莘莊車站戒備異常</p>
<p>滬西七寶鎮、自開到×師正規軍後、該團蘇團長、連日與該處游擊隊姚總指揮曁民衆隊錢大隊長等、聯絡商議、以便進攻滬杭路、莘莊駐站日軍、得悉後驚慌萬狀、連日以來、戒備森嚴、車站附近居民、勒令遷移、並日夜禁止行人出入、商店提早打烊、形勢異常嚴重、沿鐵路加派步哨、如有毀壞路軌、附近鄉民是問、並分段組織護路隊、强迫鄉民加入、故近來新龍華梅隴莘莊各站日軍、往來頻繁、恐戰事不日即將發生、</p>
<p>日軍又架軍用電話</p>
<p>日軍連日在虹口閘北區域、紛紛裝置軍用電話、除前在北江西路福生路一帶、裝置軍用電話外、昨日上午九時、又在蘇州河裏白渡橋北堍裝置軍用電話綫、直至下午三時、尙未工竣、似係臨時緊急處置、又悉近來日僑在上海一帶所經營各行業、日籍靑年聯員、紛紛卸職他往、繼其職位者、悉爲年在五六十歲左右之日人、據一般人推測、此兩事或與前綫戰事吃緊有關、</p>
<h3>華興券　無法流通</h3>
<p>近傳海關僞「監督」企圖謀阻中國法幣進出口、以遂其推行「華興券」計謀之說、茲查無準備之「華興券」、不特在租界上無人使用、即上海四郊日偽按制下之各區此項廢券、亦無法流通、平民堅決拒絕使用、態度始終不變、即「大道機關」中「華興券」亦告絕跡、惟因市面分幣吿絕後、除租界電車代價券成爲零找主體外、中央銀行之分幣券、亦因自然趨勢、由平民之手、零星流入市郊各區通用、</p>
<h3>進出口貨物　報關手續</h3>
<p>除有特別准單外　均應照通常手續</p>
<p>江海關自戰事西移後、對於轉口或進出口貨物、均經改善辦法、關於進出口貨物報關手續亦經改善、（一）所有進口輪船、除領有特別准單得在該關總監察畏辦公室呈報進口及結關外、無論按照普通行輪章程或內港行輪章程行駛、均須連同所載進出口貨物、按照通常報關手續、向該關總務課呈報進口及結關、（二）至輪運以外、以其他方法如由民船鐵道及公路運輸之貨物、應照向例在該關南市辦公處總監察長辦公室、或該關各轉口稅征收處報請查騐、</p>
<h3>滬西交涉　僞市府將答覆　傳反提「建議」解決懸案　僞警人數增加行動橫暴</h3>
<p>大陸報云、消息靈通人士昨日（十日）聲稱、上海「特別市府市長」傳筱庵、對於工部局所提暫時解決界外馬路區爭執之「建議」、將於下週答覆、一般人雖料江灣政權對此建議、不致加以直率之拒絕、但信僞方將反提建議、以期解決一切懸案、按工部局上週曾宣布其建議以警務問題爲限、無論商得何種妥洽、均爲暫時性質、昨據警務當局聲稱、西區局勢、未見實際上之變動、</p>
<p>英兵逮捕持械華人</p>
<p>大陸報云、持械華人十六人、昨日（十日）淸晨、在白利南路巡邏、被東旭萊聯隊英兵逮捕、押往大西路該聯隊司令部、今猶羈禁其中、以待認明彼等之身分、被捕諸華人持手槍、步槍與手溜彈、衣綠色制服、最初被認爲「大道警察」、惟旋經查悉若輩與「特別市府」並無關係、諸人今仍被禁東旭萊隊兵營中、供給膳宿、截止昨日深夜爲止、尙無人前往認領、衆信若輩與南京「維新政府」有關、</p>
<p>僞警增加囂張異常</p>
<p>西越界築路地帶、自僞警侵入佈崗後、各馬路里弄口、均有僞警輪班守崗、自二三名至六七名不等、日來又增加巡邏僞警、時往來於重要馬路、在以前未有僞警佈崗之藥水弄·虹橋路·東西法華·曹家渡等華界、今亦有所謂偽「警察」一大隊密佈、其行動橫暴逾恒、囂張異常、敲詐勒索、魚肉鄉民、習爲慣事、居民莫不怨聲載道、聞該僞警、均屬市中心區新近調來、</p>
<p>領口加釘特警字樣</p>
<p>大光社記者、昨分赴越界築路區域巡視、所見僞警之白色領牌上、近均加上銅質金色「上海特警」四字、另一面則加上僞警號碼數字、經向關係方面探悉、日軍目國軍西撒、侵入滬市各區後、即成立所謂「大道市府一、攫奪前上海市政府一切地方行政工作、今僞警領牌增加「上海特警」四字、即係上海「特別市警察」簡稱之標明、別無其他意義、</p>
<h3>三輪駛溫折回　被阻詳情</h3>
<p>新安納仍泊溫州口　將來航程尙未決定</p>
<p>日海軍當局揚言封鎖浙東甌江、實行阻撓外輪航溫後、所有最近由滬駛溫之英商新安興·永貞·神華·新安納·各輪、均被日艦攔阻進口、各輪雖謀改駛鱉江卸貨、但亦遭阻止、又衛利韓公司之新安利、日前由興化直放溫州、亦未獲進口、茲據大光社記者探悉、新安興·永貞·新安利各輪、均於七日由甌原輪折回、業於昨晨到滬、今後將改駛他綫、至神華輪雖經電吿折回、昨尙禾到埠、又新安納輪據續接電吿、現仍泊溫州口外、是否改駛他處或返滬、尙未決定、</p>
<p>日艦阻航</p>
<p>泰昌祥行代理之新安興·永貞兩輪、於本月六日在溫州口外被日艦所阻、不能進口後、兩輪巳於昨晨折返抵滬、停泊楊樹浦十三十六兩號浮筒、一部份旅客已於昨午登岸、據搭客談、此次永貞駛溫、在口外首先遇見日艦放下之巡弋汽艇一艘、載日軍多名、駛至永貞附近、吿該輪船主謂口外泊有日艦、如欲駛溫州、必須先向日艦接洽、永貞即在甌江封鎖綫附近處停錨、旋見山谷間泊有日艦一艘、該輪船主正欲與日艦接洽進口之時、適遇新安興由興化駛來、在日艦近處停錨、永貞當即發電向新安興詢問、並商議與日艦接洽進口事、嗣新安興復電謂日艦不准進口、即將啟椗返滬、</p>
<p>發砲示威</p>
<p>未幾、新安興即啟錨行駛、永貞船主以日艦旣阻止外輪駛入甌江、自不必再事接洽、即隨新安與之後、亦啟椗返滬、當兩輪啟椗行駛之時、日艦放空砲三響示威、船員旅客、均爲之一驚、至沿途情形、尙稱安全、</p>

<p>甬鎮駁輸　互撞肇禍</p>
<p>滬甬間航輪因貨客須在鎭海口外駁卸後、甬鎮間小掄往返頗繁、目多在夜間工作、以致時有肇禍、本月二日有行甬鎭綫之鎭海輪、由甬開鎭、擬駁運口外之德平輪旅客、詎於七時五十五分時、駛經淸水浦江面時、有美孚公司承租之火油船、甬鎭輪由鎭駛甬、因時在黑夜、致肇禍互撞、甬鎭輪船夫張順發·應紹林·受震落江、祗救起張順發名、應竟葬身魚腹矣、</p>

<p>此輩婦女</p>
<p>均携有原籍鄉鎭公所證明售，或中籤壯丁臨時外出證、紛紛來府要求給發出口通行證、雖對其本籍是否經具保限歸、未可懸揣、核與甬江旅客進出口補充辦法第七條、過路旅客、須持有原籍縣政府以上機關之證明文件、或原派遣機關之差假證、方准放行之規定、亦有未符、且此輩</p>
<p>大都貧困</p>

<p>不致斷貨</p>

<p>歐洲傳來消息、多少無益於股市、統觀昨晨衆業公所交易過程、賣方較佔優勢、開盤市况杌隍不定、價格起伏於狹小範疇內、而有部分向下趨勢、交易略轉輕淡、業廣地產·國際信託·瑞鎔鋼業·暨上海銀公司諸股、當價格開始下游時、頗得多方扶掖、</p>
<p>倫敦十日電、今日遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市稍見回落、麥加利銀行股跌二先令六便士、爲八鎊十二先令六便士、滙豐銀行香港註冊股跌一鎊、爲八十四鎊、開平煤礦股跌一先令、爲十八先令、古拉各林傍橡皮股跌十一便士、爲十八先令一便士、其餘不動、</p>

<h3>紗花　粗紗南銷活躍</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、趨勢又入盤旋之境、但大眾心理依然望好、因近來印美棉市逐步上升、故做多撈進者頗不乏人、無奈生意不起、未免美中不足、至於實需方面、華南細紗喫胃仍屬滯嗇、十支粗紗採辦繼續不懈、且大數向廠方購買之、目前據大勢論之、就海外棉價情况、應當看升、但匯票穩靜而長、加之各堆棧存貨充足、銷路不旺、暫時兩相抵捂也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開承上日虛風績進、而匯票平平、二十支雙馬開價爲六百四十八元、一刻而跌至六百四十三元、旋以外棉上漲、多說可買淮做多、又復徐徐回高至六百五十元、卒聞匯票轉鬆、兼之客銷仍遲、再行軟弱、查半日成交統計一千〇九十一包、行情雙馬跌三元、天女跌二元、雙地球跌二元、廠方由永安廠開出十支特金城一百五十包、價爲五百五十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<h3>外棉頻漲不已　本花交易起色</h3>
<p>本棉交易、續見起色、廠方·申新·新裕兩廠、對於白包亦發動採辦、至於同業、鑒於美印棉市逐步上升、人心愈形挺秀、幸外匯平穩而帶鬆勢、故棉市漲風未起、不過巳轉堅昂之途、蘇北來源、計通花八百九十五包、常陰沙一千〇二十四包、北沙來一千八百四十包、茲將現棉情形列后、</p>
<p>（現棉成交同業均係棧交、廠方交易係送廠、包烘水價值）、</p>
<p>海提尖　一二五·〇〇　一二五·五〇　同業進　六五〇包</p>
<p>木架火機　一二五·五〇　又　一八〇包</p>
<p>火機花　一二四·五〇　又　二五〇包</p>

<p>東溝花　一三一·〇〇　又　二〇〇包</p>
<p>常陰沙　一三六·〇〇　又　六〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、因匯兌之時鬆時緊、各方俱難以捉摸、故交易殊感靜寂、廠方對於外棉之採購、亦轉沉悶、同業問雖購意正濃、但亦未聞做開、日來日商廠漸轉活躍、日有千餘包美棉交易、各方前訂之美棉、將於本月下旬陸續到滬、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初殊為堅定、利物浦及孟買來電俱吿良好、人心異常興奮、投機者在市購買、頗爲活躍、因之市况殊爲挺秀、後棉價因同業之購買而再漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日又漲十餘磅音、印度運同預測漲四羅比餘、埃及漲二十餘磅音、利物浦漲十餘便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　狂抬客秈　粳米被激上漲</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源、共到河下貨南港帮十三艘、車運包子蘇同帮六車、崑山九車、太倉雙鳳五車、靑泗楓嘉等貨十餘車、共計三千三四百包、際斯登新旺期、各路來源依然有限、人心遂見向榮、是以日來粳市、常呈盤旋之勢、未有貶小之象、况客尖一路上升、粳米遂亦提高、昨則本街店胃更覺活潑、競購不衰、而囤戶亦突出搜維、一時形勢奔騰、貨主乘機猛抬、一喊恒達半元、致結果粳價較前立升一元有奇、收般常帮眞特粳爲三十一元、高三十元零五角至三十元、中市貨二十八九元、窰菉種零星交易、爲數亦多、提高六七角不等、南港早稻亦然、蘆羊尖銷塲特旺、亦升一元左右、</p>
<p>客尖來源已斷、棧存已不不足七千包、故貨主一意猛提、一方面客戶囤戶以及搶帽子者相繼並進、互相授受、節節抬高、轟動之狀、近月未有、結果江北尖收盤爲二十五元四角至二十五元二角、京蕪尖二十五元半至二十四元八角、父漲一元有奇、變元同見挺秀、升半元不一、總計統市成交數不下萬二三千包、</p>
<p>另讯　客秈愈形鋒鋩、緣在求過於供之際、人心本已向上、乃囤戶粉起吸收、本客貪辦放價、行情一日數漲、本市大宗消費之粳米反難與競、隨至造成反客爲主之局勢、按昨日粳米雖說供少上漲、然實際上仍係連朝客秈飛漲所激動、而杜羊尖之暢銷猛漲、亦因客秈不足改辦本尖之影響、客秈久乏整到、前昨雖有行販搬到、但盡係數十包一二百包之零批試運性質、日商方面據云確係多日未有整批到埠、因此連朝亦無暢出、昨日市上交易活潑、而成交數仍不足四千包、本客各戶需要旣濃、再加大戶競辦、價乃激漲一元二三一角之鉅、後市雖稍轉定、而高秈售價已見二十五元三四五角、已與低次粳米相接近云、</p>
<h3>粉市在醖釀中</h3>
<p>麪粉　昨日現粉交易、尙不寂寞、雖值週末之期、因有靑島帮客銷微動、本街零批交易、亦較前略爲貪取、而市面仍在醞釀中、二號粉廠盤續開七元三角原盤、砲車牌客盤仍須七元四角、回籠貨進出兩少、售價比廠盤別小角許、內地雜牌粉供源不絕、價在六元六七角、</p>
<p>小麥　經前日一度回跌後、各廠均擬抑價而取、惟貨方尙不過於遷就、結果雙方依然互持、統市仍祇阜豐廠略辦蘇錫常丹等麥六千包、價較前又見撳小三五分之譜、</p>
<h3>海味　蝦尾到存兩稀</h3>
<p>邇來市問　各檔蝦尾到貨旣少、底存亦稀、惟以售價高昂、交易寥落、頗呈萎靡不振之象、刻市金山尾二百七十元、江北小開羊一百二十元、至一百四十元、其餘花色俱付闕如、</p>
<h3>南北貨　雜路圓漲七八元</h3>
<p>雜路桂圓、前日四川輪僅到五十箱、又值興化方面須結外匯而後出口、成本愈高、絕無續到、故市勢甚緊、昨聞號方巳開出、較前又漲七八元云、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷糖來源防阻撓　粗的再漲一元左右</h3>
<p>昨糖市以荷蘭又有緊張之訊、與來源頗有關係、人心向上、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白再漲一元半至一元、本棧五十二元、外棧初爲五十二元至五十二元半、旋升至五十三元、後稍懈、仍到五十二元半、轉口貨升一元、爲四十一元半、太古車白據香港電、甬帮定成B嘜五千袋、上海交貨、價爲港幣一六·五五、比前升三角半、申市續升半元、B嘜爲五十五元半、至五十六元、CW嘜五十五元半、CX嘜五十五元、DY嘜五十四元、HX嘜五十三元半、H嘜車四十一元、荷赤四十二元、均升一元、本綿白一號五十二元、餘照退、一號冰六十二元半、晶明冰六十四元、均升元半、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布漲跌兩難</h3>
<p>布市以現銷平庸、且價較紗花爲低、故存貨雖盛、售盤難跌難漲、呈盤旋局面、前途趨勢、端視現銷爲轉移也、昨白貨漂染貨市價、均略帶疲、每疋回小五分至二角不等、急貨求脫售者、按市低三五角、亦有賣出、浙東溫甬台帮辦粗布·細布·色布·色斜一百五六十件、閩帮辦色斜·綫呢·嗶嘰四五十件、粤港帮辦細斜·粗布·細布一百餘件、本街辦嗶嘰·色布·絨布·坯布·粗布二百餘件、國外新加坡孟買辦漂布·色布·色斜·印花實二千餘疋、</p>
<p>東疋白貨細布。細斜市盤仍難起色、十二磅龍頭細布現盤迥旋於十八元日四角之間、蓋以實銷呆滯、市塲交易大都視外匯消長爲轉移、昨本街同業成交綜計的四五百件、客銷依然沉寂、四君子元嗶嘰每碼售開六角、據同業觀察、短時期內亦難看好、</p>
<h3>油市　生豆油市暫盤旋</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市况、除神戶大連桶裝油擯持未開外、共他簍油微升二三角、刻下市勢暫居盤旋、藍桶油在多頭公司手中、一時無賤脫之望、故簍油籌碼雖鬆動、然不免人心牽制、致脚地堅硬、昨成交膠州油二百件、（行情詳市價欄、）烟岐油二百件、靑岐油一百件、及白絞油二十桶、又聽裝絞油一百聽、花生油港方雖見續辦、但因滙水關係、賣方恐受影響、故取巡就宗旨、行市未變動、計開膠州油一百五十件、價爲五十七元原盤、及天津桶油二十桶、價亦開原盤七十四元云、</p>
<p>查豆子昨有二百五十包、由北沙來滬、</p>
<h3>煤炭　浦鋼煤去路暢旺</h3>
<p>水汀烟煤、因開平煤來源不廣、乏貨供應、市上雖有大批印度煤儲藏、終因價昂、不易推動、祇决檔貨較易人手、故日昨浦鋼煤成交頗旺、同行拆價、計開篩塊每噸七十六元、統煤七十二元、煤屑六十元、浦東棧房出貨、行槓外加、</p>
<h3>五金大馬口鐵缺俏</h3>
<p>大馬口鐵市面、日前一度岑寂、昨客帮銷路活動、以二十六號貨居大宗、查靑島烟台諸帮搜去數十箱、而本街鎖廠家及紗廠滾箇作等採辦亦不少、惟現時流通於市塲者二十四號貨軋缺、一般有貨者居奇、售盤仍須九百元許、現大量進出者僅二十六號花色貨、且有數廠家自己直接往海外購定、</p>

<h3>抗戰根據地的西南</h3>
<p>— 崧</p>
<p>我們要對西南認識　須注意下列的問題</p>
<p>所謂西南，是指湖南四川雲南貴州廣西等省而言。這幾省是我們抗戰的太後方的一部分，也是我們今後復興的基礎，我們的財源的取給，兵員的供應，靠賴這些地方的，實在很多。我們要達到這幾項目的，我們必須注意的：</p>
<p>有經濟開發問題</p>
<p>這些地帶，雖則過去因爲國家多難，未遑建設，可是地下的埋藏，却極豐富，如何開發富源，增加我們抗戰上的經濟力量，這自然是當前的急務。不過中國財力，向集中於東南，西南財力遠較東南爲差，又因交通運輸的不便，機器的運入，及熟練工人的招尋，都發生相當的困難。不過這困難也並不是不可克服的，第一，中央可以鼓勵滬上及東南各淪陷區的資本家投資內地，第二，可鼓勵華僑回國投資，第三可利用外資。這三方面在近來都獲得滿意的結果，而內地的工業開發，也有長足的進步，例如在四川有毛織廠，絲織廠糖廠，在雲南有提鍊銅鑛廠，化學工廠之設立，貴州有開採汞廠等之設立，其他如四川之嘉陵江附近，變爲新近自各地移入工廠的中心，及正在推進中的各項水力發電計劃，地下埋藏物的開發計劃，這都表示中國新經濟根據地的西南開發，巳呈蓬勃氣象。自然我們不能有了這樣的情形而就滿足，我們還希望我們的實業家，金融家，海外的僑胞，多多把集中東南或海外的游資，移入內地，共襄建國的大業。</p>
<p>有農業改進問題</p>
<p>西南可耕的面積，的有二十六萬萬畝，其中巳耕地面，共有三萬一千七百萬畝，佔總面積百分之十五。當此全國食糧，因東南產米區的淪陷，而感不足的時候，我們正應擴大耕地面積，增加食糧的生產，以達自足自給的目的。</p>
<p>有兵員訓練補充問題</p>
<p>廣西四川湖南各省，向爲中國革命過程中的兵藪。抗戰以來，爲國光榮流血的，也是這幾省的英男靑年居多。如何組織民衆，發揮自衛能力，及訓練各省的民衆，成爲捍衛國家的干城，過去廣西的民團訓練，已具顯著的成績。抗戰後總動員的推行，國民軍訓的努力，以及壯丁訓練等的實施，都獲有良好的成續。今後新軍隊的練成，以爲反攻之用，當然是有賴於西南各省的很多。</p>
<p>有苗猺少數民族的敎育問題</p>
<p>散處西南各省的苗猺民族，爲數不少。這些民族，自對日作戰後，也請纓殺敵，爲國効力，這是很可感動的現象。今後我們須對這些國內在文化上落後的同胞，應根據中山先生的民旅原則，提高他們的文化，改善他們的經濟，這樣我們可以獲得民族融洽的結果，而使我們一致對外的步調，更趨於緊密。</p>
<p>以上幾點，都是我們今日對於西南建設，所應注意的問題。</p>
<p>西南六省人口面積表</p>
<h3>西南抗戰人物誌</h3>
<p>李宗仁</p>
<p>將軍李宗仁將軍，字德鄰，廣西桂林人，生於一八九〇年。畢業於桂林軍官學校，北伐時爲國民革命軍第七軍軍長，於二十五年九江之役，二十六年龍潭之役，卓著勳勞。抗戰軍興後，率師出桂，與敵周旋，台兒莊之役大敗日軍，變爲全國崇敬之軍事將領。李將軍仍在鄂北的前錢，爲國宣勞，鄂北一年來爲銅牆鐵壁，日軍進攻，皆遭慘敗，李將軍的功勞，實在不小。</p>
<p>白崇禧</p>
<p>白崇禧將軍，字健生，廣西桂林人，生於一八九三年，畢業於保定軍官學校，早年參加辛亥革命。北伐時，爲弟十三軍軍長，一九二七年，任淞滬警備司令。後即率師北伐，攻克津浦重鎮徐州。一九二八年後回桂助李宗仁氏建設新廣西，辦理民團等重嬰工作，抗戰後廣西士兵的能够慷慨，爲國犧牲，實由於李白兩將軍的平時的功績。白將軍自抗戰軍與後，往來各戰塲，指揮佈置，勞苦功高。白將軍爲中國有數的軍事參謀人材，素有「小諸葛」之美稱。去年自日軍在廣東大亞灣登陸，進佔廣州，與本年佔領海南島，欲自北海圖謀廣西後，兩粤形勢，極爲吃緊。故國府終本年四月特派白將軍兼廣西綏靖副主任，以保衛廣西而防日人的蠢動云。</p>
<p>何應欽</p>
<p>何應欽將軍，字敬之，貴州黔西人，生於一八八九年。畢業於日本東京士官學校。早年即加入同盟會，辛亥革命時，亦曾參加推翻滿淸工作，一九二〇年至二三年，會任雲南講武學堂校長。一九一四年，任黃浦軍官學校敎務長。北伐時，任東路軍司令，下江西，克福建，於一九二六年任福建臨時省政府代理主席，後復率師北伐，抵達浙江，擊潰孫傳芳軍，與李白二將軍在龍潭一戰，澈底消滅孫傳芳勢力。一九二八年，任臨時浙江省政府主席。一九二六年後，被選爲中央執行委員，一九三〇年後被任爲軍政部長迄今云。</p>
<p>龍雲</p>
<p>龍雲將軍，字志舟，雲南昭通人，生於一八八八年。民初畢業於雲南講武學堂，歷任陸軍長官，參加護國護法諸役，民十六年由中央任爲國民革命軍軍事委員會委員，第十三路總指揮，兼雲南省政府主席。抗戰發動後，滇軍也不遠幾千里，來淞滬作戰，台兒莊之役，滇軍也與其他中央軍，共同對日作戰，獲得空前的大勝利。現在雲南爲中國復興根據地，龍將軍整飭軍政，開發實業，爲國家立恢復的基礎，中央甚爲倚畀云。</p>
<p>楊森</p>
<p>楊森將軍，四川廣安人，生於一八八七年。畢業於雲南講武學堂。參加護國之役。一九二七年，任國民革命軍第五路總指揮。在川中時，楊將軍對於實業建設，及公路交通的開闢，極爲努力。抗戰軍興後，楊將軍曾統率川軍東至黃浦江邊，與侵略者作戰，建樹了偉大的功續。保衛武漢戰時，川軍扼守湘贛間的武寗羅盤山，使日軍不敢南犯。將來楊將軍及其統率的第二十軍，在抗戰的光榮史上，與全中國其他抗戰將領一樣，永垂不朽。</p>
<h3>四川之紙</h3>
<p>目前紙價飛漲，而交通又甚不便，故內地各省均用土紙，尤其是四川之紙爲各地所樂用。四川之紙出產爲樂山縣嘉樂造紙廠所造。該廠係民國十五年爲法國留學生王槐仲所開設，資本六萬元。現已增至十四萬元。過去產品之精，價偵之廉，已屬有口皆碑。抗戰軍興，國府西遷，西南人口，突然增加，故需要激增，現每天該廠可產紙一噸以上。最近經濟部又借予資金十萬元，購置機械，擴充範圍，預定產量，每日可得三萬噸。其製紙之主要原料則爲稻草。大部由夾江，丹陸，洪雅等處運來。决爲木漿，俗稱香餅子。有時亦攙用紙屑。</p>
<p>除嘉樂廠外，四川計有一百六十五家之白紙作塲。三百十五家之草紙作塲。但都屬小規模經營，尺寸不大，不能作報紙用。最近經濟部計畫將從來迷信所用之紙改爲書寫紙，將從來的土產書寫紙改爲印刷紙。並以機器製造，正在着手進行之中。</p>
<p>除四川外，雲南昆明，亦有滇豐造紙廠之設立，係民國二十七年秋由錢新之金潤庠所創辦資本一百四十萬元，向德國定購機械，預定產量每日五噸，以一半供本省用，一半輸往廣西貴州，但因原料及其他種種關係，目前尙未開工。</p>
<h3>內江浮影</h3>
<p>— 三三</p>
<p>內江在重慶西面，是成江渝公路的中心。早上從重慶乘汽車出發，到來鳳驛或永安鎭進午餐，大概在晚上六點左右就能到內江了。</p>
<p>它是四川著名產糖之區之一，地方富庶，市面相當繁榮，幾條大街也都舖上水泥，頗爲整齊淸潔。中國，中國農民，四川鹽業，川康平民等各銀行，均在此設有分支行，而最多者當然還是糖食店，這大概就是因爲產糖之區吧？旅館大的也有二三家，大都是人家祠堂改的。中國旅行社在此也委託一家旅館做招待所，但地點似乎僻一點並不好。這些旅館和上海等大都市的旅館比較起來，自然可說是太簡陋了，但是在內地「鷄鳴早看天，未晚先投宿」的客棧來說，眞已是那摩溫了。酒館也有四五家，鷄和魚都很鮮美出名的。如果點一辣子雞，一盆辣子鯽魚，再來上半斤茅台大粬，和幾個要好朋友談談，那才够舒服哩！但因了地方的富庶，來往客商的衆多，必然的一種現象，就是私娼也跟着多。在酒館裏，客棧裏到處都可見到，而且還有一種往來於自流井——四川著名一個產鹽之區，也是極富庶的一個地方——內江的游擊娼，這些大都是第一流的佳貨，專門應酬富商巨賈的。筆者曾在當地某大銀行經理的宴會席上看到此中魁首的一位劉女士，身穿大衣，手提皮包，還講上幾句四川大英話，倒確也風姿翩翩，雖不及上海摩登女郎，却也至少超過大世界門口的兩位江北同胞。在另一方面，內江和別的地方一樣糟糕的，就是厠所的沒有，實在使我們上海等地去的人，大大過不慣。都是地下掘幾個洞，上面放二塊並不寬闊的木板，大便就請你站在上邊。萬一多站了一會酸麻，脚力不健，一個不留心，那麼就要黃金滿身了。而四周的污穢狼藉，當然也不容說起。馬桶雖有却是只供女人應用，男人並無此項權利。但若加以請求，自可特准暫用，不過，這種馬桶是瓦做成的，像一個罐子差不多，口子非常小，小便的時候不便大便，大便的時候不便小便，如果大小便同時並來，雙管齊下，雖不能說不可能，却是危險得很的。</p>
<p>因爲是產糖之區，經濟部和川省府建設廳便在此合設了一座酒精廠，利用糖脚來提煉酒精及代汽油。主持八是前上海浦東酒精廠的工程師，魏嵒壽先生。因着經費的困難，故設備是非常因陋就簡，該用鋼管的或用鐵管，該用鐵桶的或用木桶，一切機器也均自己在重慶翻造，極少外國來的。辦事人員也都是年齡很輕，極奮發有為者。每天早上六七點鐘就開始工作了。在經濟部數十個國營廠礦中，這是最有成績，也是惟一每年能有盈利的工廠了。此外，還有一僩甘蔗試騐塲，主持的也是一位留美的學生某君。據他吿訴我，現在試騐結果是爪哇種最好，比廣東蔗還甜而又水分足，將來要大量種植。同時經濟部也預備在此設立一大規模新式製搪廠，但因在外國定的機器無法運輸來川，現在只好先將土法製糖中的最新式者和小規模的機器來比較；試騐，和改良。筆者看後方知這許多有爲靑年，放棄富貴安適的生活，來睏泥地吃粗飯，埋頭苦幹，努力建設新中國，眞覺得無限興奮</p>

<h3>合作事業在四川</h3>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>「兩岸猿聲啼不住，輕舟已過萬重山。」在從前，一提起四川，腦海裏就浮起了三峽之險，蜀道之難；現在呢，一切企業都隨着戰爭移動，四南的交通，次第發達，自然的障碍，巳被人工克服，蘊藏的富源，又賴機械啟發。我係旭日東升，人爲泥足下陷，其程度却成了一個正比例。所以想把西南的繁榮狀况，一一細述，可說「罄竹難書」，此地略論四川的合作事業，以窺豹文的一斑。</p>
<p>全中國的合作團體，包括淪陷區城在內的話，有十一萬處以上，其中百分之九十九爲經濟信用合作，單以中國農民銀行的貸款而論，巳有三千一百五十三萬元，這使農民受惠非尠。本年五月梢政府成立了一個中央合作事業管理處，關於實施的方法，更有了一個縝密的計劃，以前側重農業信用貸款的合作，此後消費生產遝輸及分配等合作事業，管理處均將注意及之。</p>
<p>在四川，本年稻穀豐收，蔣委員長已命撥款一千五百四十一萬六千元購置米穀，係由各處合作銀行及合作社直接向農民購買，因爲在四川，一百二十個鄉村裏，計有合作社一萬八千二百九十三所，其中六十個以上的鄉村已成立合作銀行，資本總額共有一千萬元。農民的信用放款及抵押放款已有一，五〇一，三四一元。去年四川亦爲豐年，怕「穀賤傷農，」有一千三百十二處合作社出資八五二，八七二元收買米穀，後來又貸出五〇三，三七三元，給二十二萬三千一百五十五家農民作購備農作物種子之用。</p>
<p>同時中央合作事業管理處舉辦了一個訓練所，將合作社辦事的全體人員，分二十人爲一組，受訓練二個月，其高深的課程，由重慶附近的中央政治學校裏來担任的。</p>
<p>其他湘桂滇黔康自抗戰以還，合作事業也巳蒸蒸日上。原來西南六省蘊藏極富，戰前巳有西南建設公司等的設立，本年元旦國民政府又成立了西南經濟建設委員會，合作社也爲該會管轄。如川康滇桂的煤鐵火油等，及滇省的銅錫，湘省的鉛鋅，都是財當之源。從前有人以爲金融匯萃之處是沿海幾省，目下則巳逐漸西移，足見我國地大物博，人口衆多，想速戰速決，昧於空間因素的日人，到現在才知道中國是：「窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村」了。（菊）</p>
<h3>四川地下的埋藏物　煤與煤油</h3>
<p>「天府之國」的四川，眞是所謂得天獨厚，不但生產豐富，米穀木材桐油桑麻烟等一切食用物產都具備着，並且地下的埋藏物，也極豐富，不是他省所可比擬。就埋藏物的分佈地域講，松，潘，冕寗富於金；天全，蘆山富於銀；會理，鹽源，彭縣富於銅；南川綦江富於汞，鐵煤；其中煤的藏量，尤爲豐厚，東自奉節，西至廣漢源，南至濾縣，北至廣元，有著名的巴蜀煤田。至煤油的分佈，的可分爲三區；（一）富順縣自流井一帶。（二）嘉定樂山，健爲榮縣一帶。（三）嘉陵江附近，安岳遂寗，射江鹽亭，蓬溪，南充一帶。</p>
<p>自國民政府努力開發西南富源後，已在川中有大規模煉油廠的建設，並勘定礦區，從事採煉。巳加堪定的石油礦區，有下列各處：（一）維泉井石油礦，從事化騐的結果，油色透明，無烟，引火點極强，含量亦豐，可供全川的需要。（二）自貢井石油礦，從事化騐的結果，無烟質純，可供二十年之用，（三）蓬溪西鄉的石油礦，其面積遠八十餘畝，藏量的有六千噸之多。（四）生華溪石汕礦，爲深綠色，面積可十餘畝，引火速度爲一〇六，無臭。（五）達縣龍珠溪石油礦，爲黑色，引火速度一〇九，雜質很少，面積有三十餘畝。（六）巴縣石油礦，爲黑色，引火速度一〇二，無烟無臭，面積四十餘畝。</p>
<p>以上許多的煤田及石油礦區，如果從土法改用科學的方法，那末採量一定可以大增，而可增加我們抗戰的力量不少。</p>
<h3>四川之土法採煤</h3>
<h3>抗戰中的苗民</h3>
<p>西南的少數民族如苗猺等，因爲這次抗戰，與漢族更有機會接觸，减少了許多誤會，並且他們也負起很多抗戰的工作。原來他們的人數並不少，例如廣西一省就有三萬多苗人，其餘如桂黔等省也很多。在貴州，苗民多出任保甲長。在廣西南寗早有一個特種敎育委員會設立的特種師資訓練所，敎育這般少數民族的千弟。該校的學生現在巳參加抗戰宜傳，甚至想參加游擊戰呢。</p>
<p>苗民旁山而居，室無窗牖，男女雜居一室，夏日則同浴於河。其衣飾，男則短衣赤足，靑藍衫褲；女則衣服較長，以花布爲裙，不着裏衣，惟男女以布纏頭，無問冬夏，這倒頗有點像印度阿三的。至於食物，亦極簡單，除播棰五榖外，魚鹽算是山珍海錯了。</p>
<p>他們原有的敎育，只有馬牛鼠以記年月，結繩以記事，這是太古遺風，所以傳說他們是高辛氏的子孫。</p>
<p>苗民性極剛直，好勇鬥狠，睚毗小怨，累世必報，故湖南有「母苗仇，世不休」之諺。惟迷信特甚，人病，吿廟誓神是唯一的方法。現在如能循循善誘，妥爲訓練，呌他們橫戈殺敵，是有孟責之勇的。</p>
<h3>黔湘的苗民</h3>
<h3>西南的瘴氣</h3>
<p>原來神秘的瘴氣　乃惡性瘧的別名</p>
<p>西南的氣候，是亞熱帶的氣候。氣候終年相當的炎熱，濕度也比國內各地來得高，加之草木暢茂等自然條件，所以瘧蚊子極易繁殖。於是惡性瘧，或匯熱（Tropical　Malaria）在這些地帶很容易發生。過去國人不明白這原因，遂發生荒唐無稽之說，說西南有所謂瘴氣，這種瘴氣，中人輒死。這種無稽之說，不但流傳人口，並且載諸古籍。可是經過現代醫學家加以研究，這樣古老相傳的「瘴氣」的謎，才證明是熱帶上很流行的惡性瘧。這在五年前衛生署科長兼全國經濟委員會衛生實騐處寄生虫系主任姚永政，軍醫學校主任敎官劉經邦，衛生實騐處技正林樑城等研究黔桂交界處瘴氣最厲害的南盤口一帶，得到科學上的證明。我們旣然曉得瘴氣是惡性瘧，則治瘧之道，常然不出治瘧的特効藥奎寗。現因西南需要奎寗很殷，又因交通上的不便利，及外匯的關係，內地一切西藥的價格非常的高，西南常局，爲謀人民的健康起見，已在雲南等地，大規模地種植奎寗樹，將來這種製藥原料可敷需要後，那可怕的惡性瘧，或不致這樣的可怕了。</p>

<h3>小朋友！學學總理吧！</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>今天是孫總理誕辰的紀念日，小朋友們都在隆重地紀念他吧！</p>
<p>小朋友！我們紀念總理，應該學學總理！</p>
<p>我們的總理，非常聰明，也非常用功。但是他不願唸死書，使自己變個書獃子。所以他在村塾裏的時候，那先生只敎他唸，他便要求先生講解書中的意義。小朋友們！我們的總理從小就是一個好學多問的兒童，他一有不懂的地方，就去問先生，到澈底明白了，才覺得快樂。這種一邊學一邊問的讀醫方法，希望你們學學吧！</p>
<p>總理不但好學多問，並且有科學的思想。他覺得迷信是科學的敵人，所以闖進一個廟裏，把神像的木手拉斷。小朋友們！我們應該學學總理，把迷信的覜念摒除，用精細縝密的觀察和實騐，去探求眞實確切的知識！</p>
<h3>各國兒童的優點</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>兒童，是未來國家的主人翁，進一步說，是未來人類的主人翁，未來世界的創造者。因此，世界各國的兒童地位，可以說都是很尊重的，唯有中國，兒童敎育的落後，兒童機關的缺乏，一切都顯示兒童是尙未被人們所重視；最近是已大改變了。</p>
<p>中國的兒童，能够在德。智。體三方面樣樣具備的，只有極少數而巳。在下面，讓筆者來談些關於世界各國兒童的優點，以供各位作爲借鑑。</p>
<p>一·蘇聯的兒童好勞動，愛淸潔。他們在學校裏，大都是一面做工，一面讀書，逢到假日的時候，常到工廠中去實習，或結了隊到街道上去拾紙屑。他們祇要力能勝任，不論大小任何事情，都要來做的。</p>
<p>二·英國的兒童　富毅力，愛保守，能誠實。他們一舉一動，常常自問有吾錯誤，對於長者，極能服從。做一件事，不到絕望，是決不肯罷休的。</p>
<p>三·德國的兒童有勇氣，富研究心，崇尙運動。在德國的小學校內，散課的時候，看不到一個小學生是無精打彩的閒坐着，他們都精神抖擻地活躍於運動塲上，而在上課的時候，沒有一個不用全神聽講。他們對於一樣東西，小至玩具，必要拆開來研究它是怎樣製造的。</p>
<p>四·日本的兒童　能刻苦，肯服從。日本兒童生活的困苦，其他各國的兒童都不能與之相比。一般小學生，早上到校時，多帶了午飯，普通多是一些冷飯及幾根鹹蘿蔔乾而已，散學回家後，帮助父母辦理各項家務。</p>
<p>五·美國的兒童，性情活潑，態度大方，能團結。在街道上，常常看見有一個小孩被人欺侮時，他的同伴就要來替他打不平。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們這些優點都有嗎？沒有的，趕快從今天起也來養成它吧。我希望，在未來，你們也許比他們還要好哩！</p>
<h3>月之中池</h3>
<p>— 趙易林</p>
<p>—英國寓言—</p>
<p>有一次，一個商人出法旅行，他走到一個鄉村。在村莊外面，有一個池塘。在池塘週圍，有一葉人，他們拿釘鈀，掃帚，和稻草又放到池塘裏去亂撈一陣。旅客就問他們，在那裏幹什麼？他們說：「幹什麼？事情可大得很！月亮跌到池塘裏去了，我們再也撈不出來。一商人聽了這話，不禁哈哈大笑，就呌他們看看天上的月亮。並且說：「水裏的月亮，不過是他的影子罷了！」但是他們不相信他的話，反而大駡了他一頓。</p>
<p>所以你不要向愚蠢的人講道理。</p>
<h3>葉脈書籤的製造法</h3>
<p>— 良</p>
<p>小朋友，你有了許多新書，但是還有一樣不能缺少的東西，不知你忘記備了沒有，那便是現在所說的書籤，如果還沒有買，那麼可以請你自己來做幾張，而且做成以後旣是經濟，又是美觀，外加製法又很簡便，小朋友們不妨試一試看。</p>
<p>在未做之先，請你先要採集些心愛的樹葉標本來，放在透風的地方吹一吹乾燥，然後再到藥房中去買些苛性鈉（俗稱潮鹼，價目很便宜）放在開水裏化一化，就可以把樹葉和這苛性鈉的溶液，一同放在瓦鍋裏面，用火慢慢的加熱，使得樹葉的肉逐漸的腐化。這樣大的經過一刻鐘之久，葉子上面就起了一種漿糊樣的東西，便可以取出來用水漂淸，這時葉上的主脈，側脈等便歷歷可數了。最後在這脈上，塗上你心愛的顏色，乾後再用熨斗燙一燙，縛上一根彩色的絲帶，便成了一張經濟而美觀的葉脈書籤了。</p>
<h3>新年　—明兒避難記之四十二—</h3>
<p>— 日正</p>
<p>在那村裏人心目中唯一的假期——廢歷新年，終於隨着國歷新年後一個月左右而姍姍的到來，可是他們仲長了頭頸，盼望了有整整的一年</p>
<p>在這年底的幾天，村子裏的無論那一角一隅，富的窮的，大的小的；到處都充沛了忙的氣象。進城去的石板道上，滿背載着貨的驢兒，垂着頭，很氣喘的，似乎現出不勝負担的樣兒，在不斷的往來着，頸前的一排掛鈴跟着驢蹄的搬動發生丁令丁令的聲響，有些像在替驢兒訴苦，尤其在寂靜的空氣中，分外的悲凉。急灘旁，磨坊的水輪被水冲得透不過氣來，吱哩吱哩的在掙扎，磨坊主人更督促它加快的工作後，便可以過年休息了，因此它便努力的轉動那輪軸。椎的打擊聲也不住的響震在四周的空氣中，顯得那工作是更緊張了。溪邊的釣魚人，也突然的增加，每個人希冀釣得一二尾大魚作爲過年的美肴（因爲在那村子裏雖有錢，可是買不到新鮮的活魚，只可自已去釣了。）很耐心的靜持着願上鈎的大魚。村裏人很喜歡的在準備過年，可是被人豢養的家畜——猪，鷄，鴨……却遭到了屠殺的浩刦。要是它們知道新年的快將到來，不知在它們的心坎上要何等的慘痛哩！</p>
<p>村子裏的每一個人——大的，小的，男的，女的，老的，幼的，都是滿現着欣悅的神情，可是明兒家却一無動靜，依舊冷淸淸的和平日一般。每一個人的神情和村裏人恰成了個反比例，祇得從甜蜜的回憶中，去嚐到往年在家鄉過年的快樂滋味；如今避難在他鄉，只可看人家的過年了。</p>
<p>蒸糕，送竈，謝年……一幕一幕點綴過年的景色，在明兒的眼前演奏着。在這遠隔明兒家鄉千里外的山村風俗，畢竟有些異樣，這倒引起明兒的興趣。</p>
<p>這是一年的最後一夜，村子裏熱鬧異常，燈燭輝煌，村裏人都停止了平日的工作，幹着新的玩意。可是睡魔繚繞着明兒，把他的眼臉加重了起來，阻止它們的分開，而明兒畢竞敵不過它，便沒精打采的爬上了床。他在美麗的睡鄉中，很快樂的在家鄉度過了這最後的一晚。</p>
<p>到得一陣如雷鳴般的爆竹聲響過之後，新年便接着來了。在那淸晨的一剎那，村裏寂靜得我不出一絲聲息，每個人在做着新年夢。在九十點鐘左右，把早已佈置好了一番新的氣象的家祠門打開了，一個個穿着新衣服，一切都是新的，男子們向家祠那兒走來，彼此見了面都是免不掉的說聲「恭喜。」又隔了好一會兒，便在家祠中舉行團拜的儀式，很虔敬的向祖先拜了年，且望保佑今年太平豐收，然而彼此也道賀着。這樣的差不多有一個鐘頭，才各自的回到家裏，不再出門，因爲在這大年初一不宜上親戚朋友的大門。於是骰子聲骨牌聲替代了平日的工作聲。</p>
<p>明兒在家裏枯坐着，心中暗想着：「明年的今天，總可在家鄉快樂的過新年了。」</p>
<h3>智取與力敵</h3>
<p>— 儆予作</p>
<h3>藍矮子　（八）</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>阿麗很詫異似的說道：「咦，奇怪奇怪，這松子怎麽好端端會掉下來？」正在這時，忽聽得四周起了一種聲響，使伊不得不重又抬起頭來。只見一個個玲瓏小巧的矮人，從那一根根的樹枝上瀉落下來。伊一時眼花撩亂，彷彿是一大葉的矮人，一個又一個的瀉到地上；一會兒定了定神，才瞧淸楚並沒有多少人。當下伊很快的點着人數，一個，二個，三個，一直點到十二，十三，十四，一共是二十四個。伊仔細瞧着他們，自言自語道：「他們每兩個成為一組，足足是兩打的藍矮子。」</p>
<p>一些兒也不錯，他們正是藍矮子！他們瀉到了地上之後，便兩個一排的排列起來，兩個屈着膝在地上走，兩個在他帶來的一個木桶上走過去，兩個開始打起筋斗來，兩倘跪倒在地，回頭做着滑稽的笑臉；這樣每兩個合成一組一組的，各各做着不同的動作，把阿麗面前一片靑苔舖成的地面做了他們的遊戲塲。他們身上，穿着一色的藍衣服，正像那磁器廠中的藍矮子一模一樣。</p>
<p>阿麗靜靜地坐着，對他們瞧，伊的心中，倒並沒有奇異的感覺，只是在那裏想道：他們比了磁器廠中藍矮子大得多了；可比我的大拇指大些嗎？怎說是大一些，實在放大了好多倍，要是立道起來，足足像我的臂膀一般長。我料他們停會兒定要爬到我的膝蓋上來，我就可把他們量一下了。此刻我也不必和他們講話，且等他們先開口才是。」</p>
<p>果然不多一會，內中有兩個藍矮子離開了他們的伙伴，向着阿麗這邊走來。但他們剛走到了伊的脚邊，忽然聳身一跳，翻了個身，却用他們的頭立在地上。阿麗記得伊的姑母似乎向伊說過，他們會倒頭立在地上，也許他們要我照着做哩。於是喃喃自語道：「咦，姑知道他們的事情，怎麼會如此淸楚，他們眞的不用脚着地，而用頭來代替的。但我希望他們不要來要求我照着他們做，我是萬萬受不了的。」</p>
<p>阿麗正在這樣想着，却見那些矮子又是一跳，早翻了個身，把兩隻立直在地上了。他們都是很有禮貌的，一陣子擺手，一陣子鞠躬，然後開口說起話來。內中第一個先走過來說道：「我們怕那松子掉下來打痛了你！」</p>
<p>阿麗不知道該怎樣回他的話，停了一會，才斷斷續續的說道：「我—我不知道—對不起，先生們，我—我不知該怎樣稱呼你們。」矮子們的嘴動着，却並不做聲，阿麗以爲他們也許要報出名字來了，然而並不說話，只是對伊呆瞧着。</p>

<h3>好萊塢最近的動向</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>歐戰發生，給全世界人士以極大的苦悶後，好萊塢各影片公司，最近預備攝製大量的滑糟片。</p>
<p>在公司方面，攝製滑稽片的費用較他種如歷史片，戰事片…等爲廉，在觀衆方面可以在精神上得到一種調劑，眞可謂一舉兩得。</p>
<p>上次大戰時，不大影響影業而地位却反抬高了，同時，滑稽丑角的地位亦在這時被苔悶的人們所重視。卓別麟的成名，就因爲當時主演了「Shoulder　Arms」這一部滑糟片。</p>
<p>從過去的經騐看來，現在好萊塢各影片公司的攝製滑稽片，他們是有着極大的把握。所引為遺憾的，是缺乏這種影片的監製人；過去有二位是極負盛名的，一位呌瑙門特（Mabel　Normand），另一位呌柯潑期（Keystore　Kerps），可惜他們都已亡故了</p>
<p>勞萊·哈台二人再度合作後的第一片“TheFlyingDeuces”，就是屬於這類典型的。聞卓別麟最近亦在籌拍一部，片名尙未定。</p>
<p>至於戰事的及有關宜掦軍事的影片，各公司仍舊是不放棄的。需電華公司首先完成了一部，片名“Nurse　EdithCavell”由安娜麗格兒（AnnaNeagle主演。不過假使歐戰至年底尙不能結束，百分之五十以上好萊塢的出品，將是屬於輕鬆愉快的滑稽性質的一類。</p>
<h3>嘉寶初演喜劇</h3>
<p>— 靜遠</p>
<p>好萊塢瑞典明星嘉實，在銀幕上雖已有很久的歷史，但她過去所主演的影片，沒有一張不是悲劇，現在她却改變作風，破例和茂文道格拉斯合作了一張非常輕鬆的喜劇“Ninotscha”，由劉別謙導演。嘉寶飾的是一位俄國敢死隊女隊員，在片中的某一幕裏她親自燒製許多甜　，當這個境頭拍攝完畢時，攝影塲上的人員紛紛把這位神秘女郎親製的食品你搶我奪地吃掉，連劉別謙也嘗了兩個。大家同聲讚美嘉寶烹調術的高明，此外，據說她在片中還有許多跳舞的鏡頭呢！</p>
<h3>章遏雲與穆鐵芬</h3>
<p>— 渴雲樓主</p>
<p>晚近坤角以學程而聞於時者，當以王玉華章遏雲侯玉蘭三人最為純粹，遏雲得穆鐵芬之匡助，在程腔之進益上，實非淺鮮。蓋鐵芬佐玉霜十餘年，旦夕相從，對於腔調之竅奧，固洞悉無遺，授諸遏雲，是爲趨之直接，與人私淑雷同者，不可同日而語加以本嗓之淸婉柔潤，亢墜咸宜，一曲歌來，令人煩俗頓消，其運腔使調，始終如一，高低週轉，絲毫不露竭蹶，不尙彫琢斵喪，以端莊之本色示人，較諸玉華玉蘭，似又勝一籌矣；近聆其「仕林祭塔」所歌「二簧反調」等數折，在唱腔上着重於走底音，嬝嬝遊絲，不絕如縷，仰揚頓挫處，與玉霜近來作風，頗有相合之境，東施效顰，惟欠寬朗之一着矣。</p>
<p>鐵芬琴藝，早著聞於從前佐玉霜時，其托腔絕嚴，絲絲入扣，指音之佳，元老彥衡後，可謂無第二人，每奏一折，仰揚疾徐，靡不各趨其妙，其琴韻之全盛期，在高事所灌之「碧玉簪」「文姬歸漢」等數片中，當時玉霜調門尙高，琴聲透澈，音韻鏗鏘，愚有暇必聆，每至數十遍，不覺壓倦，彼操絃之感人，有如此者。故遏雲之捨梅取程，在唱腔上立定基礎，得有成就，鐵芬之功，誠不可沒矣。</p>
<h3>民華考選「孔夫子」</h3>
<p>最近成立之民華影業公司內定費穆編導之「孔夫子」一片旣决定張翼飾子路後—「孔夫子」一角，因選擇嚴格，尙未决定，費君現巳擬就一候選人名單，正在考慮每人之各方面條件，最後辦法閒將舉行一次評選以决定之，日內即將開始，屆時請被列人名單之無名英雄同時化裝分別試演，從中决定誰師「孔子」想決定之後，影界又可一新面目也。</p>

<p>至於外任藩鎭戰績最著，殉節最慘者，當以寗武關守將周遇吉為最壯烈，「按遇吉乃明錦州術人，少有男力，善射，崇禎中，與淸兵戰，文討逐流賊，皆有功，累官至山西總兵官，李自成陷太原，遇吉固守代州，殺賊無算力竭城陷，死之，贈太保。謚忠武。」以上係周之傳略，劇作家根據固氏滿門殉難的事實，遂編爲「寗武關」一劇，共分對刀、步戰、爬城、拜懇、別母、亂箭、諸折。劇中除主角周遇吉外，餘如周母（老旦）周夫人（旦）老家將（來）一隻虎（凈）李闖王（凈）李洪吉（小生）都在戲中佔有很重要的地位，况是劇乃表演壯烈之故實，凡包飾劇中人者，不但須能唱，而且還得能作，至於遇吉一隻虎之武功、步伐、槍刀花、允須熟練、邊式、始能爲全劇生色。關於對刀、步戰諸塲多注重於生角靠把武工等之表現，迫演至代州失陷，遇吉擬返歸寗武，拜別老母，然後再與賊兵決一死戰，以身許國，劇情情至此，始漸緊張，而感人最深者，亦正在別母與亂箭兩塲也。遇吉以戰敗之餘，滿面征塵，甲胄不整，惟思老母年邁，若覩面後騾聞失地敗歸之訊，必將使白髮老親驚駭焦慮，故周於入府時乃故作鎮靜消閑之狀，以叩見萱堂，殊斜步進中廳之後，忽見紅燭高燒，老母與夫人、公子、方共坐一席，飲酒稱觴，家庭團聚正歡，獨缺己一席也。（一三九）</p>

<h3>Development of Ningxia Achieves Results</h3>
<p>Ningxia: Ningxia has long been known as the "Heavenly Granary beyond the Border." The saying "Ningxia is enriched by the Yellow River" is well known. After the land survey in the province, the total cultivated land is estimated at 2.5 million mu. There are four major canals and dozens of smaller canals in the province, crisscrossing like Jiangnan. This year, the provincial government plans to expand the irrigated area of existing canals by 100,000 mu and build three new canals. One is in the west of the river, 120 miles long, which can irrigate 160,000 mu. The first irrigation this year will be 40,000 mu. The two canals in the east of the river can irrigate 180,000 mu, which will be released next year. In addition, Ningxia did not grow cotton in the past. Starting this year, each county has universally experimented with planting 14,000 mu. The results have proven that it can be grown everywhere. 10,000 mu of American cotton have been harvested, totaling 300,000 catties. The farmers are delighted. Next year, it is planned to plant 10,000 mu in each county, and the military and civilians in the province can be self-sufficient in cotton. The provincial government has also opened a cotton iron factory, specializing in the manufacture of iron looms and wooden spinning machines. Each county has transferred 10 people, half male and half female, to the province for training. Upon completion of the training, each will bring iron and wood machines back to their hometown to teach weaving. In addition, a wool weaving factory has been established. Wool combing machines and wool spinning machines have been shipped, and students are being actively trained and promoted. Last winter, a paper mill was established and can supply newsprint and official paper for government agencies in the province. Soap factories have been established in many places, producing 3,500 bars per day, which is enough for the province. Large-scale improvement of livestock is also underway. 180,000 yuan has been invested in building a large pasture in Ningxia. As for forests, only 800 mu, about 1 million trees, have been planted in the past few years, but this year 3,000 mu will be planted, totaling 2.4 million trees. The south of the province lacks water, and large-scale well digging and tree planting will be carried out next spring to change the climate. As for mineral resources, there were only a few coal kilns in the past. This year, people have been sent out to investigate, and coalfields are found everywhere in the province. With a little improvement, production can be increased several times. In a certain county, iron can be mined in large quantities. Also, the Yellow River within the territory is more than 300 miles long, and gold can be panned on both banks. A large number of panning beds have been manufactured and distributed to various places for imitation. Ningxia occupies the danger of four fortresses and possesses the wealth of fish and rice. People in the country should look at the new Ningxia with new eyes in the future. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>China's Foreign Trade Greatly Increases</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to official announcements here today, China's total foreign trade for the first eight months of last year reached 1,560,163,434 yuan, and China's foreign trade for the first eight months of this year increased by 493,547,035 yuan compared to last year. According to the announcement, since the outbreak of the European War, China's foreign trade has not been greatly affected. The reason for this is that most of China's goods are now exported to the United States. Except for Hong Kong, the United States has become the largest market for Chinese products. In the first eight months of this year, imports from China to the United States reached 99,499,000 yuan, and exports from China to Hong Kong reached 135,789,000 yuan. However, in August, imports from China to the United States were 19,624,501 yuan, while those to Hong Kong were only 18,112,171 yuan. The Chinese products absorbed by Japan totaled 435,640,000 yuan, while the Japanese goods imported into the occupied areas of China reached 226,208,000 yuan. Also, during this period, China's imports from the United States reached 149,156,000 yuan, imports from Germany reached 70,350,000 yuan, and imports from the United Kingdom and India reached 97,723,000 yuan. As for China's main foreign exports during this period, they were animal materials, fibers, and minerals, and the main imports were grains, cotton, and cotton yarn. Currently, although a considerable amount of China's foreign trade still passes through Shanghai, the southwestern provinces have become an important force, and their trade is biased towards exports. (Associated Press, 11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news received here today, Song Ziwen has been appointed as the chairman of the International Trade Bureau, in charge of the export of Chinese products. It is reported that the chairman of the International Trade Commission was originally held by Chen Guangfu, but since Chen Guangfu is still serving in the United States and has no time to take care of it, Song Ziwen, the former Director of Finance of Guangdong, succeeded him. According to Song Ziwen, what China will pay attention to in the future is how to increase the export volume of tung oil, raw silk, tea, medicinal materials, etc. According to news here, the export of Sichuan's bristles will be managed by the Central Trust Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in the future. At the same time, there are plans to increase the number of tanning factories to engage in tanning and then export them to save on shipping costs. (Associated Press, 11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Netherlands and Belgium</h3>
<p>The major battle on the Western Front in Europe has not yet broken out, but the neutrality of the Netherlands and Belgium on the North Sea coast is already facing serious threats. If these two countries are forced to join the war because their neutrality is violated, that would in fact be equivalent to the outbreak of the major battle on the Western Front, and the European war situation would enter another stage. Therefore, the issue of the Netherlands and Belgium is really the key to the current European war situation. Judging from the situation in recent days, it seems that the Dutch issue is more serious than the Belgian issue, but the environment of the two countries is generally the same, and it is impossible for one country to have a problem while the other can stay out of it.</p>
<p>It was only six days ago, on the evening of the 6th of this month, that King Leopold III of Belgium, accompanied by Foreign Minister Spaak, arrived in The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands, to meet with Queen Wilhelmina and Foreign Minister Kleffens of the Netherlands to discuss the international situation. At that time, news had spread that a large German commando force was concentrated on the Dutch border, carrying a large number of tanks and armored vehicles; therefore, observers believed that "the meeting of the monarchs of the Netherlands and Belgium in The Hague was due to the crisis of the authorities of the two countries feeling that they were being dragged into the war." Sure enough, one night later, the kings of the Netherlands and Belgium jointly telegraphed the warring countries of Britain, France, and Germany, expressing their willingness to mediate European peace. This weak voice certainly will not have any effect; and the newspapers of Britain and France immediately pointed out: "This is due to the German government recently imposing greater threats on its northwestern neighbors;" "Germany has already exerted great diplomatic pressure on the Netherlands and Belgium, and supplemented it with military threats;" "The heads of state of the Netherlands and Belgium issued appeals in distressed voices;" "The efforts of the heads of state of the two countries are only to shift the crisis they are suffering." Looking at it this way, the appeal for peace by the Netherlands and Belgium is just a helpless cry under the threat of severity; in fact, this kind of appeal cannot fundamentally solve the difficulties they are suffering. Then, the so-called "uniform" case suddenly occurred in the Netherlands, and a mysterious Munich bombing incident, suspected by the British and French newspapers to be the same as the Reichstag fire, occurred in Germany. On the German-Dutch border, another incident occurred in which customs officials clashed and killed each other. The successive occurrence of these unexpected events is precisely showing that the Netherlands has reached the same crisis as Poland on September 1st. Of course, Belgium has not escaped the threat, but they are both in the same predicament, and the disasters may come sooner or later. At present, it is the turn of the Netherlands first.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, Germany, in this war, benefits from a quick victory. If we ignore international right and wrong and diplomatic interests, and only look at military strategy, the major battle on the Western Front will not break out. If it is to break out, Germany will inevitably pass through the Netherlands and Belgium. In the last European War, the main enemy of the German army was France, so it passed through Belgium to attack France; but this time, the two countries have the possibility of being passed through, and the Netherlands is even more important in the German military strategy, because Hitler's main enemy is Britain, and the coast and land of the Netherlands are more suitable as naval and air force bases for attacking Britain; and the defensive strength of the Netherlands is not strong, and there is no defense between the Netherlands and Belgium. It is even more convenient to attack France from the side through this country than to directly attack Belgium. Therefore, for various reasons, it is speculated that Germany will not hesitate to trample on the neutrality of the two countries in order to facilitate its own operations, especially to covet the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has always maintained a neutral policy in international affairs, and Belgium is especially a permanently neutral country recognized by the international community (in October 1936, Belgium redeclared its neutrality), but if other countries do not respect their neutrality, they will inevitably be forced to join the war. At present, both countries are eager to make various defensive preparations, especially the Netherlands, which has decided to breach the dikes and flood the land, arranging his "flood defenses." The magnitude of the sacrifice need not be said, and it can be seen from this that they are determined to resist aggression. The situation of the two countries is precarious, and whether they can finally avoid war depends only on whether Germany can abandon its attempt to pass through them; if Germany wants to pass through them, the two countries will inevitably participate in the war. Because Belgium is congenitally allied with Britain and France; although the relationship between the Netherlands and Britain and France is not as close as that of Belgium, there are other reasons why it cannot but resist Germany.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is currently the only second-class country with a large colony. The area of the Netherlands itself is more than 30,000 square kilometers, with a population of more than 8 million; but the area of the colony is 2,400,000 square kilometers, which is 62 times larger than its own country, and the population is 61 million, which is more than 7 times more than its own country. Therefore, the Netherlands has always relied on the supply of its colonies, and the colonies are the life of the Netherlands. Most of the Dutch colonies are located between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and a small part is in South America, bordering the territories of the colonies of Britain and France; in history, most of the Dutch colonies have been seized by Britain, and in the current situation, it cannot but maintain considerable friendship with Britain in order to preserve its existing colonies. The situation of this European War is roughly the same as the previous one. If the Netherlands allows Germany to pass through, it is equivalent to joining the German side, and the overseas colonies to which its life is tied may be lost in an instant.</p>
<h3>Stalled Anglo-Japanese Talks: Significant Differences in Opinion Regarding Anglo-Japanese Issues in China</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers reported today that Britain has followed in the footsteps of the United States, recently adopting a tougher stance towards Japan on the China issue. It is reported that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie, during talks with Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Kensuke Horiuchi this week, mentioned the issue of British coal mine operations in China. The British side protested against the Japanese authorities' interference in mining operations in China and requested Japan to change its attitude towards British interests in China. "Miyako Shimbun" reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura will depart for China to participate in the "New Nanjing Regime" led by Wang Jingwei. The newspaper stated that the "New Regime" may request Japan to abolish the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's territorial integrity, or the "New Regime" may announce its abolition. The newspaper also stated that Germany's recognition of the "Wang Regime" could be a litmus test of Germany's friendship with Japan. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Reports state that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie, during his meeting with Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi yesterday, argued that Anglo-Japanese issues in China should be adjusted jointly with US-Japanese relations, but the Japanese Vice Foreign Minister insisted that Anglo-Japanese relations in China should be adjusted separately. With significant differences in opinion, the meeting made no progress. Therefore, the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin negotiations have not been reopened. It is understood that the British Ambassador's views have not changed since his last meeting with Horiuchi. Reuters learned that Craigie discussed various Anglo-Japanese pending issues but did not raise the issue of reopening the Tianjin negotiations. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura and US Ambassador Grew have not yet begun formal negotiations. The first meeting between these two diplomats on November 4 was only preliminary. The talks between Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi and British Ambassador Craigie were also only a preliminary discussion on some Anglo-Japanese pending issues, and not a general discussion on all issues related to British interests in China. From the appearance of things, negotiations between Japan and the United States and Britain have clearly reached a stalemate, and there seems to be no hope of resolving the various difficulties. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Miyako Shimbun reported that Foreign Minister Nomura is now planning to seek the opinions of British and American external administrators to prepare a basis for formal negotiations with Britain and the United States to resolve the issue of British and American interests in China. However, it is heard that the Japanese government does not want to involve in the negotiations British and American interests based on unilateral or unequal treaties, or based on agreements between China and this third country, and wants to leave this issue to possible diplomatic negotiations between Britain and the United States and the "New Central Government of China." (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the talks between British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Kensuke Horiuchi yesterday, well-informed sources here recently stated that if the Japanese government wishes to reopen negotiations on the Tianjin issue in China, the British government is also willing to do so. It must be stated, however, that Britain's original attitude has not changed to this day. Although it is willing to discuss a comprehensive solution to all pending issues between the two countries in the Far East, it should be based on respecting British interests in China and with the consent of other signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty before any decision can be made.

<h3>Sun Ke Speaks in England: The Situation of China's Resistance War, New Army Trained in Western Provinces, Soviet Union Supplies the Most Foreign Arms</h3>
<p>London: Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, stated to a reporter from a news publication here yesterday, "Since our country implemented compulsory military service, only fifteen months have passed, and a new army has been concentrated for training in many places in the western provinces. All soldiers are brave and good at fighting youths. They are willing to go through fire and water to defend the motherland and resist aggression. No one knows where this secret new army is, or when our country's large-scale offensive is actively preparing to launch, except for President Chiang. In addition, there are ordnance factories built in various places in the western capital, numbering in the thousands. The factory buildings are scattered in various places to avoid Japanese bombing. We are also building prototype factories in various places, engaged in small-scale mass production. These factories are scattered in various places and are no different from villas built among green mountains and famous springs. They are invisible from the air. Since the outbreak of the European war, various necessary supplies have been continuously transported to our country from various countries, and the impact of the European war is very limited. The commercial treaty signed between our country and the Soviet government in Moscow in June of this year has been implemented. The Soviet Union will supply our country with military supplies and machines, and we will supply the Soviet Union with tea and various important metal products such as tungsten and antimony. In short, the assistance and military supplies given to us by that country are more than any other country. As for the kerosene, steel, agricultural machinery, and heavy-duty vehicles produced in the United States, they are transported to our country via Burma, taking the road built by hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers by hand. In addition, our country has a bumper harvest everywhere, and all warehouses are full. Only the flooded areas occupied by the Japanese army are suffering from food shortages." Then, Sun expressed his feelings about the situation in London, briefly saying that wartime London has completely changed its original appearance, like a drama. No bombs have fallen within your country, but the entire country implements light control at night, which shows that your country's seriousness about the war is something our country cannot match.

<h3>Damage to American Nationals in China: State Department Opens a List</h3>

<h3>Oshima Discusses German-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>New York: Former Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima, on his way back to Japan, stopped in New York yesterday and gave a statement to reporters, declaring that there is no basis for the foreign reports that the Japanese government is displeased with the conclusion of the German-Soviet pact. Not only does he personally believe that the signing of the German-Soviet pact does not hinder German-Japanese relations, but also people in Tokyo all believe that Germany really needed to conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union. When the reporter continued to ask about his impressions in Europe, Oshima stated that from diplomatic, military, and economic perspectives, Germany's position today is better than in 1914, and the morale of the German people is also very good.

<h3>Netherlands Feels Severe Threat: Adopts Dike-Breaking Strategy to Prevent German Attack, Defense Line Forms Semicircle, Mechanized Units Ineffective, Belgium and the Netherlands Mutually Dependent, Have Joint Determination to Resist</h3>
<p>The Hague: Rumors that Germany is about to attack the Netherlands are rampant. The Dutch General Staff has taken various precautionary measures, the most important of which is to flood the "Water Line" area. In 1672, this "Water Line" repelled the cavalry of French King Louis XIV. It was later planned and equipped in 1874, becoming the eastern line of the Dutch defense system. After the flooding, an average depth of seventy centimeters (equivalent to slightly more than twenty-nine inches) can be maintained. The invading country's motorized units will lose their effectiveness, and ordinary boats cannot travel due to the shallow water. Only flat-bottomed boats can pass, so their offensive will inevitably be greatly hindered. In addition to the "Water Line," the Netherlands has also built fixed and temporary fortifications on land, which can serve as bases for combat. The main roads are also equipped with anti-tank facilities and landmines are buried. Bridges in many places can be blown up immediately. In short, the Dutch defense system can be divided into three major lines, all of which are semicircular. The westernmost line starts from Elburg on the coast of the Zuiderzee, passes through Twente, Zutphen, Nijmegen, and reaches the lower reaches of the Waal River. The eastern line is the second line, starting from Harderwijk and Netterden, passing east of Amersfoort and the highlands of Tiel and 's-Hertogenbosch, and then turning westward to the mouth of the Maas River, extending to the island of Voorne. The third line, also the most important "Water Line," starts from the cities of Muiden and Naarden on the coast of the Zuiderzee and ends at the city of Gorkum on the Maas River. The major cities of the Netherlands, such as the capital Amsterdam, the port of Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht, are all within this defense line. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris: The threat felt by the neutral status of Belgium and the Netherlands has recently increased. Diplomatic circles here are extremely concerned, and it is said that Germany has made threatening representations to each country. Although this statement has not been confirmed, according to news from the capitals of Belgium and the Netherlands, although each country is very calm on the surface, the anxiety is very common. The emergency meeting convened by the Belgian cabinet at 9 pm tonight is clear evidence of this. The German government reaffirmed through diplomatic channels on August 26 of this year that it would respect the neutrality of Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Luxembourg under all circumstances. Britain and France automatically accepted unilateral restrictions in the spring of this year, declaring that they would guarantee the neutrality of the Netherlands. As for the neutrality of Belgium, they made a clear statement to guarantee it after Germany unilaterally abolished the Locarno Treaty in 1936. It can be seen that both belligerent countries originally had the obligation to respect the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands. However, the German government has recently concentrated troops near the borders of each country, and Führer Hitler has also stated that he is prepared to engage in a bayonet fight with Britain. All of this suggests that military action against Belgium and the Netherlands is imminent. There are no more than three ways to do this: (1) attack the coast of the Netherlands in order to set up air force bases there and approach Britain; (2) enter Belgium via the Netherlands to threaten the left flank of the French army; (3) take a general offensive on the entire line of the western border of Germany in order to find the weakest point. However, political figures here believe that no matter how Germany chooses, Belgium and the Netherlands are prepared for any eventuality. When King Leopold III of Belgium recently held talks with the Queen of the Netherlands, Army Chief of Staff General van den Bergen also accompanied him to the Netherlands. There is no doubt that the two sides discussed various military issues. It can be seen from the fact that the governments of the two countries have separately strengthened various precautionary measures afterward. In short, although Belgium and the Netherlands do not currently have a military agreement, the two sides are connected by land and are as interdependent as the spokes of a wheel. When Germany takes military action in the future, even if it wants to limit it to one of Belgium and the Netherlands, it will be difficult to do in reality. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Belgium and the Netherlands Maintain Calm: Fully Maintain Neutrality, Dutch Army Opens Eastern Border to Increase Defense, Belgian Army of 600,000 Has Been Mobilized</h3>
<p>Amsterdam: Dutch troops have been dispatched to key points on the border in recent days. Yesterday, reporters continued to see Dutch troops heading to the German-Dutch border. At dawn yesterday, Dutch troops on the border continued to work, building new defense lines. According to nearby farmers, Dutch troops have been continuously carrying out these defensive works for several days after the outbreak of the European war. Somewhere in the western Netherlands, civilian laborers have begun to be hired to assist in the construction of defensive works. The reporter was extremely impressed by the quiet state of the Dutch soldiers and civilians on the border. When the reporter passed through a so-called dangerous area, a Dutch village girl, dressed in medieval Dutch clothing, still smiled and waved to the reporter, as usual. The calmness and faith of the Dutch soldiers and civilians is in stark contrast to what foreign newspapers call that if Germany wants to invade the Netherlands, it will inevitably create another "fait accompli". The reporter was particularly impressed by the high efficiency of traffic control by the Dutch border guards. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital: "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" recently published news from The Hague, Netherlands, stating that after the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands called for peace, the international situation has not improved. After considering the repercussions caused by this move and studying the general situation, the governments of each country decided to strengthen various precautionary measures and concentrated a large number of troops in the border areas. In the case of Belgium alone, an army of 600,000 members has now been mobilized. On the German side, they are busy building many new bridges over the Rhine River near Belgium. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Brussels: The Belgian newspaper "L'Indépendance Belge" recently published an article commenting on the international situation, briefly saying, "We have now reached a critical juncture. The tension in the international situation has reached its peak. Judging from the reactions of the belligerent countries to our country's call for peace, there is no hope of restoring peace in the short term. Therefore, military action may intensify in a short period of time, especially if Belgium has not been directly threatened. The result of our government's strict implementation of the policy of neutrality has made the whole world aware of our diplomatic frankness and has not given others the slightest excuse to involve our country in the whirlpool of war. Although rumors are rampant, we still believe that our country will be able to stay out of it. The only duty of all compatriots at present is to remain calm, live and work in peace, as usual, and not to easily believe rumors." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Dutch Authorities Deny: Germany Makes Threatening Demands, British and American Nationals Not Ordered to Leave the Netherlands, Serious Situation Inevitably Over-Discussed</h3>
<p>The Hague: According to news from foreign sources, Germany has made threatening representations to the Dutch government. Responsible people here recently firmly denied this. Officials in charge said that since the international situation has become more serious, the governments of neutral countries have taken various precautionary measures, which is caused by the uneasiness felt by those countries themselves, and not due to external threats. As far as the Netherlands is concerned, it will definitely take various appropriate measures to ensure that others respect its neutrality. It is heard that landmines have been buried in the border area. Although traffic between the Netherlands and Germany has not been interrupted, train delays and postal delays do exist. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Well-informed sources here recently stated that British consulates in the Netherlands have not formally advised British nationals to begin evacuating. It is also not accurate to say that Germany has made threatening representations to the Dutch government, demanding to borrow certain ports and airfields. However, the relationship between Germany and the Netherlands is becoming increasingly tense, which is a real situation. This situation is being closely watched by the British government. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3>Various Countries Celebrate Armistice Day in Europe: Britain and France Do Not Hold Military Parades, French President Delivers Radio Address</h3>
<p>New York: The United States celebrated Armistice Day in Europe yesterday. Senator Wheeler led marchers, shouting the slogan "Congress should not allow the United States to be involved in the war" and strongly argued that the United States should remain neutral.

<p>London: Britain and the British Empire today commemorated the 21st anniversary of the armistice in a wartime atmosphere. There was no military parade and no formal two minutes of silence. Most offices and families observed two minutes of silence at 11:00 am. Westminster Abbey still held a memorial service. To avoid crowding, representatives of various groups offered flowers in front of the War Memorial in the predetermined order. The British king's wreath, made of poppies and cornflowers, was offered first. Millions of red poppies were sold nationwide, and they were placed next to French cornflowers to show Anglo-French unity. The ceremonies for commemorating the armistice overseas were also very solemn, especially in Australia, where a special memorial service was held in front of the Parliament Building. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris: Today is the 21st anniversary of the armistice of the European War. All sectors of French society, contrary to past practice, did not take a holiday. All agencies continued to operate as usual, and all stores continued to do business as usual. Various patriotic groups sent representatives to offer wreaths to the tombs of fallen soldiers in various places to express their respect. The government only held a memorial ceremony in the morning led by President Lebrun and all cabinet members and military leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and observed a minute of silence as usual. A team of soldiers from Britain, France, and Poland participated in the event. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris: Today is the 21st anniversary of the armistice of the previous European War. President Lebrun gave a special radio address, briefly saying, "November 11, 1939, everything is very different from the past. There should be a military parade on this day as usual, but it will no longer be held. When we observe a minute of silence, we cannot help but recall the pain and glory of the last war, and express our respect to the victims of this war. Before the outbreak of this war, our country used every possible method to try to avoid it, and worked hard to replace force with reconciliation and free negotiations. We have also accepted various sacrifices to maintain peace, which has saddened our allies. Although this move has had no effect, we can be ashamed of our conscience. I recently went to the front line to inspect and comfort the people in the rear. I am very optimistic about the future of the war. The combination of the two great empires of Britain and France is the most powerful group in the world, and we can be sure of victory. In addition, spiritual strength is also a key element of victory. One of the belligerent countries has been constantly attacking free nations in recent years in order to achieve the goal of hegemony, and strongly wants to promote various principles and regulations, so that it is impossible to establish normal relations between countries. On the contrary, the other side of the belligerent countries has a very noble, generous, and humane goal of combat. From this point of view, it is self-evident who will win and who will lose. At this moment, the democratic countries of Western Europe have completely consistent views. In essence, they are to maintain freedom, uphold justice, maintain truth, respect life, and keep promises. Human interaction and international relations must take these as the norm, so that small countries will not perish one after another, and various civilized principles, that is, the principles that the martyrs were willing to suffer and fight for, still exist and are respected. This is understood by countries all over the world. Pope Pius XII recently issued an encyclical condemning violent acts, and the Speaker of the US House of Representatives also expressed sympathy to Britain and France on behalf of the House. Moreover, the mutual assistance treaty signed between Britain, France, and Turkey has enhanced the prestige of Britain and France in the Near East. The signatory countries of the Oslo Convention (namely Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Finland) have also jointly issued a statement, saying that each country has the right to independent survival and enjoys various freedoms, that is, the freedoms that Britain and France are fighting for with blood. All of this proves that even if countries around the world maintain neutrality in action, they express sympathy to us in thought. Because our victory is related to all mankind, and all countries in the world have been able to understand this. The above is the reason why we are fighting, and it is also what we can be proud of, and the guarantee of our victory." (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3>British Aristocrat Sues, Exposing Anglo-German Diplomatic Secrets; Princess Hohenlohe's Lawsuit Continues, Revealing the Inside Story of the Munich Agreement</h3>
<p>London: In the ongoing trial of Princess Hohenlohe's lawsuit against British press tycoon Lord Rothermere for breach of contract, it was revealed today how Hitler could assist the princess in her lawsuit against Rothermere, and how the princess worked behind the scenes to ensure the success of the Munich Agreement. The defendant's lawyer, Jowitt, questioned the following excerpts from a letter from Hitler's aide, Wiedemann, to Rothermere: "The German Führer greatly admires the princess's work in adjusting relations between our two countries, as you know. The Munich Agreement was achieved through the princess's behind-the-scenes efforts. Moreover, it was the princess who introduced you to the German Führer. The Führer is by nature chivalrous, and coupled with his genuine friendship with the princess, I believe that under these circumstances, the Führer will provide any possible assistance to her struggle to restore her personal reputation and financial standing, but this is not something the Führer finds pleasant." Jowitt then inquired why the German Führer did not find it pleasant. The princess replied that it was because she hated the newspaper announcements, which caused laughter among the audience. Jowitt then read Rothermere's reply, stating, "I am convinced that the German Führer does not want to trouble himself with the trivial matter of whether Princess Hohenlohe has grounds to claim compensation from me. I have always been extremely generous to the princess, and I am prepared to go to Germany to meet the German Führer and explain everything." After receiving this letter, Wiedemann replied, "Although this is something the German Führer does not find pleasant, he may feel compelled to allow her to present the correspondence between you and the Führer to the court as evidence to help a friend and a woman. After studying the princess's demands, I cannot ask or advise her to withdraw her demands from you." In response to the lawyer's questioning, the princess denied that Wiedemann had exerted pressure on Rothermere to resolve the case, and stated that three days before the trial began, the lord had pressured her to withdraw the lawsuit. The lawyer inquired about a letter from a publisher in Philadelphia offering to buy her documents for 25,000 British pounds. The princess replied that she was not a writer, had never written manuscripts, and did not recall the name of the sender, but she remembered showing the letter to the lord. Jowitt, the lawyer, said that Lord Rothermere now claims that the princess never mentioned this matter. The princess immediately replied, "I deeply regret that the lord is lying. The Philadelphia letter greatly displeased the lord, because the lord hired me to work exclusively for him." At this point, Jowitt defended Lord Rothermere, stating that the lord could easily pay the amount demanded by the princess, even a larger amount, but felt that the princess's demands were not honest and therefore had to be rejected. As for the defamatory remarks about the princess published in European newspapers, the lord felt it was best to treat them with contempt. The princess wanted to file a defamation lawsuit, but the lord only advised her not to do so and did not force her not to sue. The lord had never heard of the suggestion of supporting the princess for life, so he instructed his lawyer to write a letter stating that this was not an honest request, and the princess herself knew that her request was dishonest. Jowitt then attacked the princess's private photocopying of secret letters, stating that the princess secretly took photocopies of private letters behind the lord's back through the special photography bureau of the German Chancellery, which the lord had no knowledge of beforehand. The court adjourned the hearing at this point. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Still Face Considerable Difficulties; New Dutch Proposal Rejected</h3>

<h3>American Strange Baby: One of Two Heads Removed, Still Able to Survive</h3>
<p>Bristol: According to Dr. Stange's report yesterday, a male infant with two heads has continued to survive for three weeks after one of the two heads was removed. The other removed head was connected to the base of the skull of the first head, and vaguely had the appearance of ears, nose, mouth, and eyes. The child was born on October 17th, weighing nine pounds, and has now increased to nine and a quarter pounds. According to Dr. Fishbein, President of the American Medical Association, yesterday in New York, "This is a rare but not unprecedented event." There have been surviving two-headed children in the past, although their survival period was extremely short, but there are even more cases of undeveloped two-headed infants.

<h3>Munich Bombing: Funeral for Seven Victims; Hitler Personally Attends the Funeral, City Flies Flags at Half-Mast in Mourning</h3>
<p>Berlin: Führer Hitler suddenly arrived in Munich this morning to personally attend the funeral of those killed by the bomb at the Bürgerbräukeller. Hitler's representative, Hess, and others followed to assist with the funeral. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Munich: The memorial service for the seven victims of the Munich tragedy began here at 11:00 this morning. All offices unanimously flew flags at half-mast in mourning. The residents of Munich also took the same action. Soldiers guarded the remains all night, and the coffins were placed in the Feldherrnhalle. This morning, citizens gathered in front of the hall to prepare to attend the ceremony. Relatives of the victims and representatives of the Nazi Party attended the ceremony. It is reported that all seven coffins will be sent to the public cemetery in the northern district for burial. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<h3>Hess's Eulogy Inspires People</h3>
<p>Munich: During the funeral of the victims of the Munich tragedy, Hitler's representative, Hess, delivered a speech before Führer Hitler and dignitaries from the party, government, and military. After severely criticizing those who plotted the murder, Hess comforted the souls of the victims in heaven, saying, "Comrades who have sacrificed, the people of Germany mourn deeply with your families. The people of Germany will never forget you. The youth of the Nazi Party will follow in your footsteps, supporting our Führer to make up for your regrets, just as warriors fighting for the freedom of Germany, step forward one after another on the front lines. But you are sleeping peacefully in the embrace of peace and fraternal love. Your sacrifice shows the Germans how dangerous the plan to assassinate the Führer was. The conspirators inspire hatred in the hearts of the Germans. The people of Germany, stimulated by this, will be even more loyal and courageous when fighting for the country. What is especially important is that the survival of the Führer makes us feel infinitely gratified, because the survival of the Führer is more important than our own survival. That is why we were even moved to tears when we learned of the Führer's escape. God has left Führer Hitler to be our leader, and God will bless him. During the last World War, God saved Führer Hitler from the artillery fire, and then repeatedly saved him. This time, our Führer escaped safely again in Munich, which proves that God has abandoned him and blessed him. No matter who designs it, for the sake of the welfare of the German people, God will make Führer Hitler turn bad luck into good fortune and turn misfortune into auspiciousness. We firmly believe that this crime is beneficial to the Führer, and at the same time, the war that began because of this crime is not only beneficial to Germany but also beneficial to the world. The victory of Germany will promote true peace in the world. The victory of Germany will eliminate the dangerous factors that incite war, and at the same time, it will prevent peace-loving people from being oppressed by war again. The enemy wants to rob us of our leader, but as a result, we become even stronger. The enemy wants to destroy our future beliefs, but as a result, our faith in God is strengthened. The enemy wants to shake our confidence in the war, but our confidence in victory is even more firm and unquestionable. Victory must belong to us, and we must win glory for the dead." After Hess finished speaking, Führer Hitler personally placed a wreath in front of the coffin, and the artillery fired salutes to pay tribute. The band played "Ich hatt' einen Kameraden" and the national anthem in mourning. Hitler then shook hands with the families of the victims one by one, expressing his condolences. The coffins of the victims were then escorted by Nazi Party guards to the northern cemetery for burial. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of the Bombing</h3>
<p>Munich: The official "German News Agency" learned last night that the expert committee investigating the Munich bombing case will be tripled in size today to examine thousands of statements and countless testimonies in the hope of finding clues. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<h3>Condolences from All Sides for Hitler's Escape</h3>
<p>Berlin: An official communique was issued here today stating that, due to the Munich bombing case, representatives from various countries have expressed condolences to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for the safety of the German Führer and expressed regret for the victims. These countries include Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands, Hungary, Iran, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, the Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Venezuela. In addition, the foreign ministers or ministers of foreign affairs of countries such as Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Hungary, Japan, Portugal, Romania, the Soviet Union, Spain, and Sweden have also expressed their congratulations to the German diplomatic representatives in their respective countries for the German Führer's escape.

<h3>Hitler's Image Destroyed in Downtown Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin: Following the bombing at the Munich Bürgerbräukeller on Wednesday night, a portrait of Hitler displayed in the window of a well-known photography shop in the central district of Berlin was destroyed. German newspapers continued to publish reports of the Führer's escape yesterday, and stated that the incident must have been instigated by another country, most likely Britain. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<h3>Shooting Incident on the German-Dutch Border; Netherlands Considers it a Serious Matter and Requests Joint Investigation with Germany</h3>
<p>The Hague: Regarding the shooting incident in Venlo, a town on the Dutch-German border, the "Algemeen Handelsblad" recently reported that the Dutch government has notified Germany that the incident is serious and requests that officials be sent to conduct a joint investigation to clarify responsibility. At the same time, the government is collecting various data in the hope of finding out the truth. Although the wording of the published communiqué is very euphemistic, it clearly indicates that German political police did kidnap two people on the Dutch border and tried to forcibly escort them back to Germany. Because the two men refused to go with them, the political police "finished" them and took their bodies back to Germany, and this group was protected by armed German customs officers, allowing them to leave unhindered. It has not yet been determined who the deceased were. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Sikorski Succeeds as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army</h3>
<p>London: According to Paris radio, General Smigly-Rydz, Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, has been dismissed and will be succeeded by General Sikorski. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>British Residents in Shanghai Donate to Red Cross Fund</h3>
<p>London: The Central Committee of the War Fund organized by British residents in Shanghai has sent its first donation of £3,400, which has been allocated to the Red Cross Fund presided over by the Mayor of this city. The total amount of this fund is now £646,000. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Attempt to Assassinate Egyptian King</h3>
<p>Nitric Acid Splash Failed; Assassin Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>Cairo: Egyptian King Farouk was hit by a bottle full of gasoline on the street today. The bottle landed behind the royal carriage and was not damaged. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Egyptian King Farouk</p>
<p>Cairo: When Egyptian King Farouk was returning to the palace from a mosque today, a man suddenly jumped to the side of the car and tried to splash nitric acid into the car. Fortunately, he failed, and the man was arrested on the spot. It was then discovered that he was a former official of the Ministry of Finance. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Auxiliary Ship "Northern Rover" Missing</h3>
<p>London: The Admiralty recently announced that our auxiliary ship "Northern Rover" has been missing for days, and all searches have been unsuccessful. It is presumed that an accident has occurred. The ship has four officers and twenty-three sailors. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>New York Foreign Exchange Market: Dutch Guilder Stable, Belgian Franc Declines</h3>
<p>New York: The exchange rates of the Netherlands and Belgium in the New York foreign exchange market today were both affected by the fear that Germany might pass through the Netherlands and Belgium to attack Britain and France from the side, and the impact of funds seeking to escape into the United States. The three-month discount on the Dutch guilder today was 185, while yesterday's market price was 60, but the spot price was stable at 53.08, because of official control. Because the Netherlands has moved a large part of its gold to the United States last year, this is a preparation to resist capital flight. The Belgian franc has fallen sharply, from 16.45 yesterday to 16.08, and the three-month discount has also increased from 30 to 45. The decline in the Belgian currency is due to rumors that Brussels needs gold urgently. The reason why Brussels has this need is the preparation of foreigners to leave the country and the transfer of funds. Although trading in the British pound is not active, it is superficially stable. The closing price today was $3.865, 1.5 points higher than yesterday's closing price. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Discusses US-Japan Relations; War Unlikely</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Although the newspapers here have greatly exaggerated the actions of the US naval and air forces in the Pacific, and regard them as a serious threat to Japan, according to an expert on Pacific issues here, the majority of US-Japan wars are unlikely to occur. Although Japan's war in China has lasted for more than two years, Japan's naval strength has not been lost at all. Therefore, if the United States wants to go to war with Japan, it must have the determination to sacrifice a large part of its navy to destroy the Japanese navy before it can be done. However, it is doubtful whether the United States has this kind of adventurous determination to sacrifice. As for the current actions of the US Navy, one is defensive in nature and the other is demonstrative in nature. However, although the United States will not go to war with Japan, if the United States can impose economic sanctions on Japan, it will be enough to restore Japan's reason. If the United States can use naval blockade as the backing for economic sanctions, then Washington can become the leader of East Asia within a considerable period of time, and restore the Far East to fairness and peace, said the expert. Japan is now under threat from the United States, and is eager to compromise with its long-time enemy, the Soviet Union. As for the Soviet Union, because it is hostile to the United States and because its position in Western Europe is not yet strong, it also hopes to eliminate the tense relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. However, it can be asserted that the Soviet Union will never give de facto recognition to the Wang Jingwei regime. In short, even if a compromise relationship is established between the Soviet Union and Japan, it will never be the compromise relationship that Japan expects. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Prisoners Oppose Warlords</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Two thousand and one hundred Japanese prisoners now here have formed an "Anti-War Movement League of Japanese Residents in China." Today, on the occasion of the armistice anniversary of the European War, they issued a declaration advocating the overthrow of the Japanese warlord rule. The declaration stated, "In this war of aggression against China, Japanese soldiers have already shed the last drop of blood. At the same time, we resolutely oppose the inhumane and barbaric actions of the Japanese army. Although the Japanese army has raised the banner of anti-communism and the name of patriotism, its actions are actually enslaving China. In fact, the only way to achieve true liberation for the nations of Asia is through the success of the Chinese revolution. We hope that on this day next year, the Japanese warlords can be overthrown and enjoy the blessings of true peace." (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Drama Association performed the play "Fighting for Peace" at the "Daxia Theater" (literal translation) today. The Japanese officers, soldiers, and embassy officials in the play were all played by Japanese prisoners from the concentration camp in southern Chongqing. The uniforms they wore were provided by the Chinese army. The Japanese prisoners performed in Japanese and were very serious. The audience reached 1,500 people. The purpose of this performance was to raise funds to purchase winter clothing for the soldiers at the front. The honorary tickets were priced as high as 200 yuan each. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<h3>Korean Youths in Chongqing Will Go to North China</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news here today, twenty-eight youths from the Korean National Party are scheduled to leave Chongqing next Wednesday to go to North China in order to contact their Korean compatriots behind the Japanese army's front lines. According to the leader of the group, there are many Koreans in the Japanese-occupied areas, who have invested in Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces in North China. On the surface, Koreans can operate freely, but in fact, they are completely controlled by the Japanese. The reason why this group of Korean youths was able to travel this time was entirely due to the financial assistance of the Chinese government. It was also said that after arriving in Xi'an, the members would cooperate with the Chinese guerrillas and work separately in order to achieve the greatest effect. Therefore, their stay in North China will be extended indefinitely. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Plans to Establish a Provincial Library</h3>

The Education Department has been ordered to actively prepare, and has hired Gu Ji, Meng Wentong, and others as preparatory members. (11th Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Sends Personnel to Inspect Education in Various Counties of the Province; A Total of Nine People Have Now Set Off Separately</h3>
<p>(Fangyan Correspondence) The Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, Xu Shaodi, believes that although the promotion of education in various counties and cities in the province has been somewhat delayed due to the impact of the war, the personnel of local educational institutions have been able to work earnestly and diligently. Therefore, the promotion of local educational undertakings has been extremely smooth in the past two years, especially the promotion of social education after the war has been even more rapid. In order to understand the latest educational situation in various counties, all inspectors, Chen Boyuan, Hong Chichang, Liang Chunfang, Zhu Wenzha, Zhao Yuren, Jin Xueyan, Xu Mingyuan, and others, as well as inspectors Shen Guanglie, Zhong Zhuangjie, and others, were specially dispatched a few days ago to set off separately for the Jin, Qu, Yan, Ning, Shao, Wen, and Tai districts and counties, and various counties in western Zhejiang, to inspect the promotion of education, as a basis for future improvement.</p>
<h3>Shanghai: A Glimpse of Talent Supply and Demand Two Years After the War (3)</h3>
<p>Pan Wenan, Zheng Wenhan, Shen Guanglie</p>
<p>Having analyzed the educational levels of job seekers, we will now further study their work abilities. According to the analysis in Table 4, commercial talent is the most numerous among job seekers, accounting for 36.1%. Even excluding trainees (11%), they still occupy the top position. Among them, company and store clerks are the most numerous, with quite a few bookkeeping and accounting talents. Old-style accountants and clerks are also quite numerous. Compared with the previous year, commercial talent has increased sharply by more than 13%, mainly because Shanghai, as an isolated island, has faced increasingly deteriorating conditions, making normal commerce unsustainable, leading to many personnel layoffs. The second position is taken by educational talent, accounting for 16.9%, a significant decrease from the first year after the war. This is because of the surge in schools at all levels relocating to Shanghai from the nearby occupied areas to resume classes, and the continuous establishment of new schools, resulting in better opportunities. Ranking third are personnel in literary affairs, accounting for 11.1%, almost the same as before. Among them, secretaries are the most numerous, followed by Chinese and English typists, clerks, and editors. Technical talent has increased significantly, more than five times compared to before. The reason for this can be said to be the same fate as commercial talent. Transportation talent has doubled compared to before, which is because Shanghai has become an isolated island, transportation is obstructed, and talent has become largely unemployed. With the decline of industry and commerce and the relocation of large and small institutions, servants and messengers have naturally increased accordingly, with their percentage doubling compared to before. Engineering and industrial specialists, such as those in machinery, radio, telephone, architecture, glass, and leather, have decreased sharply compared to before. Most of them have been conscripted to serve in the inland areas, because the inland areas still need engineering talent. It is more economical for artisans to source materials locally. Factories believe that it is not cost-effective to pay 100 to 200 yuan for travel expenses to hire an artisan. Talents in medicine, art, foreign languages, law and politics, and agriculture are very few and not worth comparing.</p>

<h3>West Union Football Group A Match Yesterday: Tung Wah Defeats French Business School 3-2; Players Fighting Almost Led to an Unpleasant Ending; Qin Biga Was Brilliant Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the West Union Football Group A match, Tung Wah played against the French Business School. The match took place at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon with more than 3,000 spectators. Tung Wah's Wan Xianghua suddenly suffered from asthma the night before, almost fainting. Therefore, although he arrived at the field yesterday, he did not play. According to the doctor's opinion, he cannot do strenuous exercise for a year. Tung Wah had no choice but to assign Wang Cuixing as the inner forward and Hu Hanwen as the midfielder. The French Business School also changed its lineup due to the absence of Ke Lai Tuo Xue Gelun. In the first half, the French Business School took the lead with 2 to 1. As a result, Tung Wah reversed the defeat with 3 to 2. Both sides lacked clarity in their actions yesterday, especially the French Business School, which was particularly rude. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah Association</p>
<p>Qin Biga</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang, Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Shu Shigeng, Cai Shengmiao, Hu Hanwen</p>
<p>Wu Binghao, Wan Jin, Dai Linjing, Wang Cuixing, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>French Business School Association</p>
<p>Bao Saizhong</p>
<p>Jie Su, Pan Kuilai</p>
<p>Saiweina, Jie Muhuat, Ani</p>
<p>Lai Teweisiqi, Shi Peishi, Laborstov, Mihailov, Dimiquelin</p>
<p>French Business School Took a 2-1 Lead</p>
<p>After the contact, the French Business School first played with ten people. Tung Wah attacked first and was blocked. The French Business School launched a full-scale attack, and Tung Wah's forbidden zone was in danger. Qin Biga was agile and escaped the danger. After fifteen minutes, Laborstov, the little yellow hair of the French Business School, got the ball thrown in from the boundary and shot fiercely from 25 yards. Qin was unable to save it and lost the goal. In less than a minute, Tung Wah equalized through Wang Cuixing in a counterattack. At this time, Ani from the French Business School arrived to join the team, making up the legal number of players. After 25 minutes, Shi Xishi of the French Business School got the ball from the back and passed it to Little Yellow Hair, who swept the ball across the goal in the penalty area and scored again. The French Business School took the lead with 2 to 1. Little Yellow Hair came back again and sent the ball to the goal area. At this time, Chen Zhuang was outside and failed to save it in time, causing Qin Biga to guard the empty goal alone. Dimiquelin rushed up to shoot, intending to score, but the ball was too high and was pushed into a corner kick by Qin. The audience was nervous for Tung Wah. Afterwards, Shi Peishi was hit and injured, leaving the field. Huat took a free kick, and Qin Biga rushed out. When Shi returned to the green, the first half ended, with the French Business School leading 2-1.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick Determined the Victory</p>
<p>The second half began, and Tung Wah's forward line was reorganized. Wang and Wu served as left and right inner forwards, and Wan Jin was changed to left wing. The offensive was greatly increased. Jie Su of the French Business School was quick and saved the ball twice. Jia Youliang swept the ball from ten yards away from the goal, but it was held down and thrown out by Bao Saizhong lying on the ground. After twelve minutes, Wan Jin got the ball from Wang Cuixing and obliquely knocked it from the corner, straight into the net, tying the score (2 to 2). Then, Little Yellow Hair tricked Zhuang Youren and attacked the goal from seven or eight yards away. Qin Biga pushed it into the crossbar and bounced down, and then made another shot to escape the danger. It was so wonderful. After 30 minutes, Mihailov committed a handball and was penalized with a penalty kick. Cai Shengsen took the kick, but Bao pushed it into a corner kick. However, in a blink of an eye, Saiweina jumped up and hit someone again, and was penalized with another penalty kick, which was scored in one fell swoop, determining the victory. After the French Business School lost, the actions were excessive. Little Yellow Hair was judged to leave the field for repeatedly receiving warnings and hitting Youren again, and Shi Peishi attacked and beat Youliang. Binghao helped Youliang fight back, almost leading to an unpleasant ending. After the matter was settled, the game continued, and the situation was slightly clearer. The game ended, and Tung Wah defeated the French Business School 3-2.</p>

<h3>The Whole City and County Flags Today: Warmly Celebrate the Premier's Birthday; Both Concessions Implement Normal Alert; All Sectors Expand the Recruitment of Winter Clothing Funds</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the late Premier of the Kuomintang. All sectors, considering the extraordinary times, do not hold extravagant celebrations or any ceremonies. However, in order to commemorate the Premier's fearless revolutionary spirit and his great achievements in creating the Republic, it was decided to follow the methods agreed upon by various groups and the authorities of the two concessions, and uniformly display flags for one day today to celebrate and show respect. Enthusiastic people from all walks of life are also practicing thrift and expanding the recruitment of funds for winter clothing to慰勞慰劳慰勞 the soldiers at the front and relieve the suffering同胞同胞同胞.</p>
<p>Banking and Money Industries Take a Make-up Holiday Tomorrow</p>
<p>In accordance with the National Government's regulations on revolutionary memorial days, all agencies, groups, and schools will have a holiday today to celebrate. However, since today is a Sunday, all sectors are taking a holiday as usual, and considering the extraordinary times, there will be no make-up holiday tomorrow. However, the member banks and firms belonging to the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association will still take a make-up holiday tomorrow. Other institutions such as the Jianghai Customs, the Postal Service, and courts at all levels will remain open as usual.</p>
<p>Concessions Implement Normal Alert</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions, considering that today is the Premier's birthday, have decided to implement a temporary alert for one day to prevent accidents within the concessions. They have issued orders to all police stations to increase the number of detectives patrolling all roads, searching pedestrians and vehicles, and implementing a temporary normal alert. Armored vehicles have been intensified patrolling since yesterday. The French Concession Police Department also searched the French Park and other places yesterday morning. Police officers in both concessions will also be on duty as usual today in preparation for temporary dispatch.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in the Suburbs Carry Out an Invisible Martial Law</p>
<p>The suburbs of Shanghai declared an invisible martial law starting yesterday morning. Because today is the anniversary of the birth of Sun Premier, the wind is tight in the suburban areas and nearby counties. The number of Chinese mobile troops lurking is also increasing daily. They are moving and mobilizing day and night. It is feared that they will launch a glorious attack on the urban area on this great memorial day to celebrate. Therefore, the Japanese side has to engage in prevention. The number of Japanese soldiers on guard at various important roads is more than usual. The police on the roads are also instructed by the Japanese to intensify the search of civilians entering and leaving the area to prevent those holding weapons from mixing in. Civilians are staying at home, and the streets are extremely desolate. However, the east-west traffic on the Huangpu River has not been blocked.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in the Suburbs Continuously Attack; Japanese Troops are Extremely Nervous; Half of the Freight Trains Carry Troops; Japanese Planes Fly West to Bomb and Reconnoiter; Temporary Military Telephones Were Set Up in Hongkou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the Jinghu and Huhang Railways were occupied by the Japanese, all passenger trains on both lines have been running twice a day in opposite directions. Freight trains are dispatched according to the amount of goods. On average, about 40 trains arrive in Shanghai every day. Since the 8th of this month, the Japanese army has been drawing soldiers from various places due to the active guerrillas in various places, and transporting them by freight train. Therefore, only about 20 freight trains have arrived in recent days. The arrival of rice and grains from Xijia Songsu and other places has also been obstructed, and the arrival of goods has dropped sharply. Since the 8th, the amount of rice arriving every day has been very small, more than half less than usual. As a result, rice prices have skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Clear Gunfire Heard in Longhua and Xinzhuang</p>
<p>Since the Chinese regular army and the Righteous National Salvation Army advanced to the suburbs of Shanghai, they have established close contact with the guerrillas in various places and frequently attacked the Japanese army, often achieving significant gains. However, the areas of Baoshan, Luodian, Chuansha, and Nanhui have gradually become silent recently, while the areas of Longhua, Minhang, and Xinzhuang have become active. According to people from western Shanghai, since the 7th of this month, clear gunfire and machine gun fire can be heard every night from 2:00 am to 4:00 am, and at dawn. During the day, it is impossible to hear due to the noise of people. This must be because the guerrillas launched an attack at night, causing the war.</p>
<p>Many Japanese Planes Fly West for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>At 10:38 am yesterday, eight Japanese heavy bombers took off from Dàchǎng Airport, divided into three teams, and flew west. At 2:10 pm, three Japanese reconnaissance planes also flew west from the east, and their direction did not change. In view of the gunfire in western Shanghai, the Japanese army must be engaged in reconnaissance operations of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Extraordinary Alert at Xinzhuang Station</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the × Division's regular army in Qibao Town, western Shanghai, Su, the commander of the regiment, has been in contact with Yao, the commander-in-chief of the local guerrillas, and Qian, the leader of the masses, to discuss how to attack the Huhang Railway. The Japanese troops stationed at Xinzhuang Station were alarmed and have been on high alert in recent days. Residents near the station have been ordered to relocate, and pedestrians are prohibited from entering and leaving the area day and night. Stores close early, and the situation is extremely serious. More sentries have been added along the railway. If there is any damage to the railway tracks, the nearby villagers will be held accountable, and road protection teams will be organized in sections, forcing the villagers to join. Therefore, Japanese troops at Xinlonghua, Meilong, and Xinzhuang stations have been frequent lately. It is feared that the war will break out soon.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Set Up Military Telephones Again</p>
<p>Japanese troops have been setting up military telephones in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas for days. In addition to setting up military telephones in the Beijiangxi Road and Fusheng Road areas, they also set up military telephone lines at the northern end of the Baidu Bridge on the Suzhou River at 9:00 am yesterday. As of 3:00 pm, the work had not yet been completed. It seems to be a temporary emergency measure. It is also learned that Japanese youth members of various industries operated by Japanese侨 Japanese僑 in Shanghai have been resigning and going elsewhere. Those who succeed them are all Japanese people around the age of fifty or sixty. According to general speculation, these two events may be related to the tight war situation on the front line.</p>
<h3>Hwasing Notes Cannot Circulate</h3>
<p>It has recently been reported that the bogus "Supervisor" of the Customs intends to prevent the import and export of Chinese legal tender in order to carry out his plan to promote "Hwasing Notes". According to investigations, "Hwasing Notes" without preparation are not only not used in the concessions, but also cannot circulate in the districts under the control of the Japanese伪 and puppets in the suburbs of Shanghai. Civilians resolutely refuse to use them, and their attitude remains unchanged. Even in the "Dadao 機關大道機關," "Hwasing Notes" have disappeared. However, due to the exhaustion of small denominations in the market, in addition to the tram coupons in the concessions becoming the main body for small change, the small denomination notes of the Central Bank are also, due to natural trends, used in a scattered manner by civilians in various districts in the suburbs.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Goods: Customs Declaration Procedures</h3>
<p>Except for Special Permits, Normal Procedures Should be Followed</p>
<p>Since the war shifted westward, the Jianghai Customs has improved its methods for transit or import and export goods, and the customs declaration procedures for import and export goods have also been improved. (1) All imported ships, unless they have obtained special permits to report import and clearance at the office of the Director General of the Customs, whether operating under ordinary shipping regulations or inland port shipping regulations, must report import and clearance to the General Affairs Department of the Customs in accordance with normal customs declaration procedures, along with the import and export goods they carry. (2) As for goods transported by other methods other than ships, such as by civilian boats, railways, and highways, they should be reported for inspection at the South City Office of the Customs, the Office of the Director General, or the various transit tax collection offices of the Customs, as usual.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Negotiations: Puppet City Government to Reply, Rumored to Counter with "Suggestions" to Resolve Pending Issues, Puppet Police Numbers Increase, Actions Increasingly Brutal</h3>
<p>The Continental Press reports: Sources close to the matter stated yesterday (the 10th) that Chuan Xiaoan, the "Mayor" of the Shanghai "Special City Government," will respond next week to the "suggestions" proposed by the Public Works Department regarding the temporary resolution of disputes over roads outside the settlement. While it is generally expected that the Jiangwan regime will not directly reject these suggestions, it is believed that the puppet side will counter with its own suggestions in an effort to resolve all outstanding issues. It is understood that the Public Works Department announced last week that its suggestions were limited to police matters and that any compromise reached would be of a temporary nature. According to police authorities yesterday, there have been no actual changes in the situation in the western district.</p>
<p>British Soldiers Arrest Armed Chinese</p>
<p>The Continental Press reports: Sixteen armed Chinese were arrested by British soldiers of the East Surrey Regiment while patrolling on Brennan Road yesterday (the 10th) morning. They were taken to the regiment's headquarters on Great Western Road, where they are still being held to determine their identities. The arrested Chinese were carrying pistols, rifles, and hand grenades, and were wearing green uniforms. They were initially thought to be "Great Way Police," but it was later discovered that they had no connection to the "Special City Government." The individuals are still being held in the East Surrey Regiment's barracks, where they are being provided with food and lodging. As of late last night, no one had come forward to claim them. It is widely believed that these individuals are affiliated with the Nanjing "Reformed Government."</p>
<p>Increase in Arrogant Puppet Police</p>
<p>In the areas of the Western Extra-Settlement Roads, since the intrusion of puppet police to establish posts, there are puppet police on duty at the entrances of various roads and alleys, ranging from two or three to six or seven. Recently, there has been an increase in puppet police patrols, frequently moving along important roads. In the Chinese areas of Yaoshui Lane, Hongqiao Road, East and West Fahua, Caojiadu, etc., where there were no puppet police posts before, there are now large detachments of so-called puppet "police" densely stationed. Their actions are more brutal than ever, their arrogance is extreme, and extortion and oppression of the local people have become commonplace. Residents are filled with complaints. It is reported that these puppet police are newly transferred from the city center area.</p>
<p>"Special Police" Markings Added to Collars</p>
<p>A reporter from the Daguang News Agency inspected the areas of the Extra-Settlement Roads yesterday and observed that the white collar badges of the puppet police now have the four gilded characters "Shanghai Special Police" added. On the other side, the puppet police's number is added. Inquiries with relevant parties revealed that after the Japanese military Westward Advance and intrusion into various districts of Shanghai, they established the so-called "Great Way City Government" and seized all local administrative work from the former Shanghai Municipal Government. The addition of the words "Shanghai Special Police" to the puppet police collar badges is simply a marking of the abbreviation of "Shanghai Special City Police" and has no other significance.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Steamship Refusal at Wenzhou</h3>
<p>The Xin'anna Remains Docked Outside Wenzhou, Future Voyage Undecided</p>
<p>After the Japanese naval authorities threatened to blockade the Oujiang River in eastern Zhejiang and obstructed foreign ships from sailing to Wenzhou, all the British merchant ships recently sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou, including the Xin'anxing, Yongzhen, Shenhua, and Xin'anna, were intercepted by Japanese warships. Although the ships attempted to divert to Biejang to unload cargo, they were also prevented. In addition, the Xin'anli, belonging to Weilihan Company, sailed directly from Xinghua to Wenzhou a few days ago but was also not allowed to enter. According to information obtained by the Daguang News Agency reporter, the Xin'anxing, Yongzhen, and Xin'anli all turned back on the 7th and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. They will change routes in the future. Although the Shenhua was telegraphed to turn back, it has not yet arrived. According to a subsequent telegram, the Xin'anna is still docked outside Wenzhou and it has not yet been decided whether to divert elsewhere or return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Obstruct Navigation</p>
<p>The Xin'anxing and Yongzhen, represented by Taichangxiang Company, were obstructed by Japanese warships outside Wenzhou on the 6th of this month and could not enter the port. The two ships returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and are docked at buoys 13 and 16 of Yangshupu. Some of the passengers disembarked yesterday afternoon. According to the passengers, the Yongzhen encountered a patrol boat lowered by a Japanese warship outside the port. Many Japanese soldiers were on board. The boat sailed near the Yongzhen and informed the ship's owner that Japanese warships were anchored outside the port and that if they wished to sail to Wenzhou, they must first contact the Japanese warship. The Yongzhen then anchored near the Oujiang blockade line. A Japanese warship was seen anchored in a mountain valley. Just as the ship's owner was about to contact the Japanese warship to enter the port, the Xin'anxing happened to sail from Xinghua and anchored near the Japanese warship. The Yongzhen immediately sent a telegram to the Xin'anxing to inquire and discuss contacting the Japanese warship to enter the port. The Xin'anxing then replied that the Japanese warship did not allow entry and would set sail to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Firing Warning Shots</p>
<p>Shortly after, the Xin'anxing set sail. The owner of the Yongzhen, seeing that the Japanese warship had prevented foreign ships from entering the Oujiang River, decided that there was no need to contact them again. He followed the Xin'anxing and set sail to return to Shanghai. As the two ships were setting sail, the Japanese warship fired three blank shots as a warning, startling the crew and passengers. The situation along the way was generally safe.</p>
<h3>Muslims to Hold Eid al-Fitr Ceremony</h3>
<p>Letter from Guilin Reports Sighting of New Moon on the First Day</p>
<p>The Muslims in this city fast every year during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, called Ramadan, fasting for a month. At the beginning and end of the fasting period, they look for the new moon on the first day of the lunar calendar. If the moon is not seen, they begin fasting on the third day. The same applies at the end of the period. Yesterday was the first day of the lunar calendar. If the new moon was seen, the Eid al-Fitr ceremony (i.e., the breaking of the fast) will be held at 8:00 a.m. today (the 12th) at various mosques. If the moon was not seen on the first day, the ceremony will be held at 8:00 a.m. on the 13th at various mosques. It is reported that most Muslims began fasting during the period on the third day of the lunar calendar. Later, a letter from Guilin, Guangxi, reported that the new moon was seen on the first day. It is reported that after holding the Eid al-Fitr ceremony, the Muslims in this city must still make up for the one day of fasting at the beginning.</p>
<h3>Italian Embassy Congratulates Hitler on Escape, Italian Community and Fascist Groups in Shanghai Also Express Congratulations to Germans</h3>

<h3>Yesterday's European Armistice Commemoration, Poles Celebrate National Day, Simple and Solemn Ceremony Held Before the Goddess of Peace, Polish Consulate's Celebration as Grand as Ever</h3>
<p>Yesterday (November 11th) was the 21st anniversary of the Armistice of the European Great War. Foreign residents of the Allied countries that participated in the previous war, as the European Second Great War becomes increasingly tense, have special reflections on this day. Consuls General, military commanders, and overseas residents of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France in this port all had commemorative ceremonies. Yesterday was also Poland's National Day of Restoration. Today, the country is once again under oppression, so the Polish community felt mixed emotions of sorrow and joy. The Polish Consulate in Shanghai held a reception to show joy and encourage the future. Also, it was the birthday of the King of Italy, and the Italian community in Shanghai also celebrated it together. Details are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Music and Flowers Before the Goddess of Peace</p>
<p>At 8:30 a.m. yesterday, a commemorative ceremony was held in front of the Goddess of Peace on the Bund, led by Mr. Aidan King, Chairman of the British Legion. Participants included Sir Philip, the British Consul General in Shanghai, Major General Simons, the British Defense Forces Commander, Rear Admiral Holt, the British Navy Commander in Shanghai, Dean Treeby, and Mr. MacKnowden, the representative of the Public Works Department. In addition, hundreds of British and American businessmen and students also came to participate. At that time, the Chinese and English constabularies increased the number of detectives to maintain order. The West Yorkshire Regiment of the British Army played mourning music. In the solemn atmosphere, the British Consul General first presented a wreath in front of the statue of the goddess. Major General Simons and Rear Admiral Holt then presented wreaths on behalf of the British Army and Navy and made short speeches. The event then dispersed. Mrs. Whipple, Chairman of the Fourth Regiment of the US Navy and the American Women's Association, presented flowers at the memorial monument at 11:00 a.m. to express their condolences.</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony Held in Church</p>
<p>At 10:45 a.m., a commemorative ceremony was held at the British Church at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Jiujiang Road, led by Dean Treeby. At 11:00 a.m., members of the British Legion and the British community stood in silence for three minutes to commemorate the soldiers who died on the battlefield. The wind music of the first team of the West Yorkshire Regiment was poignant and moving. In the French Concession, the French Consul General Baudoz organized a ceremony, held in the Catholic Church on Tianzhu Church Street. Participants included the French Consul General, French military officers in Shanghai, representatives of the French Municipal Council, and hundreds of French students and scouts, who held a memorial ceremony. At about 10:00 a.m., they all went to the French cemetery on Avenue Vilmont to lay flowers. British veterans in Shanghai usually have a dinner every year, but this year, due to the extraordinary times, it was canceled.</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony for French Soldiers and Civilians</p>
<p>The French Army and veteran groups stationed in Shanghai, hosted by the French Consul General in Shanghai, first held a meeting at the Catholic Church on Tianzhu Church Street at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. At about 10:00 a.m., they departed from the Catholic Church and went to the French cemetery on Avenue Vilmont in Avenue Joffre to lay flowers. When passing through Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Joffre, the patrolmen along the way prohibited pedestrians from crossing the road.</p>
<p>Polish Embassy Holds National Day Celebration</p>
<p>Yesterday was Poland's National Day. From 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., the Polish Chargé d'Affaires in China, Ross, and his wife hosted Polish expatriates and guests at the Embassy at 83 Bidong Road to celebrate. The American Consul General Gauss, the British Consul General Philip, and the French Consul General Baudoz all attended and had lunch. When the Polish Chargé d'Affaires raised his glass to congratulate the Polish President, the guests at the table were all moved. At 7:45 p.m., Mr. Ross broadcast a short speech in French on the Shanghai French Association Radio Station.</p>
<p>Polish Minister Releases Communiqué</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily reported on November 11 that the Polish Mission in this port issued a communiqué to this newspaper (the French newspaper referred to itself) on its November 11 National Day commemoration, saying, "Poland regained its independence on November 11 after being ruled by foreign races for 150 years. Before that, Poland had occupied a very important political position in Eastern Europe for 800 years. Unfortunately, it was invaded by neighboring countries by force in 1772, 1792, and 1875. However, the Poles' bravery and resistance were unforgettable. Later, after the defeat of Germany and Austria in 1914 and 1918, the Poles formed an army and drove their enemies out of the country, thus declaring independence. On November 11, 1918, General Pilsudski announced the existence of the Polish nation to all countries in the name of the Polish nation. For 21 years since then, Poland has always contributed to the peace and economy of the international, Central European, and Eastern European aspects. What is vivid in people's minds is that the recent German invasion has made this contribution disappear. However, since September 1, after the German army invaded Poland, democratic countries have risen up and sent troops to help. Although the victory or defeat is still undecided, the Poles deeply believe that the final victory will be ours."</p>
<p>Italian Ambassador Holds Reception</p>
<p>The Italian community was also very happy yesterday, as it was the birthday of the King of Italy, Emmanuel III. Therefore, the Italian Ambassador Di Margio held a grand banquet from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at his residence at 28 Jinshenfu Road. During the banquet, the Italian Ambassador gave a speech to the guests, describing the history of the Italian King.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Refugees to the Philippines Issued by the Consul in Manila</h3>
<p>The Chinese Consulate General in Manila recently discovered that Chinese refugees in the Philippines in southern China did not go through the procedures at the consulate. Special measures are taken as follows: (1) After arriving in the Philippines, refugees must go to the consulate to go through the procedures on the dates designated by the consulate. Do not privately request the immigration officers to go to their residences to go through the procedures or to get fingerprints. (2) When the consulate designates the date for the refugees to go to the consulate to go through the procedures, each refugee must bring twelve front and side photos and report their current residence address to the consulate. (3) If a refugee has measles or rhinitis and goes to the hospital for treatment, he must report his address to the consulate when he is discharged from the hospital, and request the Immigration Office to send someone to come and get fingerprints. (4) When a chicken breeder comes to the Philippines, the applicant must report to the consulate three or four days in advance so that the consulate can have enough time to send a letter to the Philippine Immigration Office so that it can be released immediately when the ship arrives at the shore.</p>
<h3>Six Provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi United Land and Water Army, Route Has Been Surveyed and Can Be Implemented Soon, Japanese Blockade Policy Will Be Completely Ineffective</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, the six provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi will implement combined land and water transportation. The route has been surveyed. The purpose is to develop foreign trade and consolidate wartime finance. After implementation, goods from various provinces will be unimpeded. The Japanese blockade policy will inevitably be completely ineffective. Freight transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo will inevitably become increasingly frequent. At that time, the Ende, Yingzhou, Xin Beijing, and Xin'anna, which originally sailed on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, will continue to join the sailing. I learned that the commercial market in Ningbo has gradually returned to its former appearance, and many merchants from the mainland gathered in Ningbo to purchase.</p>
<p>Barge Collision Between Ningbo and Zhenhai Causes Disaster</p>
<p>Because cargo and passengers on ships between Shanghai and Ningbo must be loaded and unloaded outside Zhenhai, small boats between Ningbo and Zhenhai travel back and forth quite frequently, mostly working at night, which often leads to disasters. On the 2nd of this month, the Zhenhai ship, which was traveling on the Ningbo-Zhenhai line, set off from Ningbo to Zhenhai, intending to barge passengers from the De Ping ship outside the port. Unexpectedly, at 7:55 a.m., when passing through the Qingshui Pu River, a kerosene ship leased by Meifu Company, Ningbo Zhenhai ship sailed from Zhenhai to Ningbo, because it was dark at the time, which caused a collision. Zhang Shunfa and Ying Shaolin, the boatmen of the Ningbo Zhenhai ship, fell into the river due to the earthquake and were rescued only by Zhang Shunfa. Ying was buried in the belly of the fish.</p>
<p>Gales Outside the Port Delay the Voyage</p>
<p>There are currently many ships between Yongjian and Ying, including the German merchant Moufu, Haifu, Hana, and Feikang British merchant Yongtai, and Italian merchants De Ping, Haida, and Baoli. Since the Zhejiang Customs allowed native products from Yong to be transshipped to Shanghai without foreign exchange settlement, freight transportation has become more frequent. Therefore, the time for each ship to load and unload passengers and goods outside Zhenhai has become delayed again. In recent days, the wind and waves outside Zhenhai Port have been quite severe, causing barges not to dare to sail out of the port to load and unload. The voyage is becoming more and more delayed. Ships such as Feikang Hana have all been postponed to return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants in Hongzhen, West Shanghai, Illegally Set Up an Automobile Factory</h3>
<p>Near Tianbao Road in Hongzhen, West Shanghai, the Japanese merchant Marushō Automobile Factory (i.e., automobile manufacturing factory) was recently discovered to have illegally enclosed more than 40 acres of private land to prepare for the construction of factory buildings and recruit workers to manufacture automobiles. The property rights of the original dozens of landowners were not taken into consideration at all. Generally, the private houses enclosed in the area must be ordered to be demolished without giving a penny. The landowners want to cry but have no tears.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Controls Eggs, British Factories Discuss Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Now Only Duck Eggs are Allowed to be Freely Sold</p>
<p>After the Japanese side intercepted the eggs transported to Shanghai, the general egg vendors were repeatedly confiscated and suffered miserably, while the British merchant Maochang Foreign Company and Peilin Egg Factory, which operate the egg business, also suffered heavy losses due to the disappearance of the source. According to a large egg vendor, in order to appease the public opinion and cover up the actions, the Japanese side has now allowed a portion of duck eggs to be freely transported to the 16th Shop for sale.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Tobacco for Domestic Use Approved</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a circular to all customs houses, prohibiting the transportation of domestic cigarettes into the interior. The Shanghai Cigarette Industry Guild suffered too much loss and submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, asking it to forward it to the Ministry of Finance to withdraw its order. Since this telegram was sent, it has been reported that the Ministry of Finance has agreed to the request and issued a circular to all customs houses to allow domestic Shanghai cigarettes to be transported domestically. In the future, there will be no further detentions, and the cigarettes detained at the coastal defense will also be ordered to be released. It is reported that after receiving this news, the industry association has prepared various procedures and stepped up production to meet the needs of the interior.</p>

<h3>Ning County Chief Asks to Issue a Circular to Zhejiang People Not to Leave Their Hometowns Easily, Promote Human Resource Management, Strictly Prohibit Strong Men from Leaving Without Authorization, and Export of Women for Employment is Feared to be Stranded in a Foreign Land</h3>
<p>Yu Jimin, the county chief of Ning County, Zhejiang Province, presented a document to Chairman Huang of the provincial government yesterday to promote human resource control and restrict the export of passengers, saying that women, the elderly, and children must have sufficient reasons to apply for export permits, and they must provide a guarantee to return to their home districts within a limited time. After reviewing the documents from the Commander-in-Chief Gu Yuan, the county followed the regulations. However, after investigating, women, children, the elderly, and children from various counties in the inland of the province are still taking the road to Ningbo to Shanghai in an endless stream, with the most promising women exporting for employment with no return date.</p>
<p>These Women</p>
<p>They all carry certificates from the township public office of their original residence, or temporary exit permits for conscripted men, and they come to the government one after another to ask for export permits. Although it is not possible to guess whether they have been guaranteed to return to their original residence, they are not in compliance with Article 7 of the Supplementary Measures for Passengers Entering and Exiting Yongjiang, which stipulates that transit passengers must hold a certificate from an agency above the county government of their original residence, or a leave permit from the original dispatching agency, before they can be released. And these</p>
<p>Mostly Poor</p>
<p>They do not bring much money. The government is not convenient to order them to find a guarantee to return within a limited time, so they are advised to return to their home district, and they all hope to be allowed to export, and they will delay for a long time. It is bound to be exhausted, stranded in a foreign land, and at this time of high prices, it will inevitably suffer from freezing and starvation. In addition to having tried our best to persuade them to return to their home districts as soon as possible, we intend to ask you to issue a circular to all counties, advising them not to leave their hometowns and come to Ningbo lightly, so as to avoid</p>
<p>Various Difficulties</p>
<p>And strictly prohibit the township public offices from issuing certificates indiscriminately and "temporary exit permits for conscripted men" that are not applicable to women. If it is claimed that there is indeed an important matter and an application for export is made, the export permit or official documents should be reported to the county government of the original residence for verification in accordance with the regulations, in order to comply with human resource management.</p>
<h3>Panamanian Ship Chinese Crew Released</h3>
<p>Ship Still Under Detention</p>
<p>The Chinese Mail reports that a Japanese naval spokesman said yesterday (10th) at a press conference that two senior Chinese crew members of the Panamanian ship Polly Volefar, who were arrested by the "Special City Government" police, have been released. The US Consul General Gauss represented the Panamanian government and sent letters to the Japanese Consul General on the 1st and 2nd of this month to draw attention to the matter. The Japanese Consul General Miura replied on the 10th, saying that the two arrested persons had been released, but the release of the ship involved several issues, so the matter was still under investigation. The Polly Volefar is still being detained at the new Mitsui Wharf, and there are no Japanese guards on board the ship.</p>
<h3>Language Exhibition Closes Tonight</h3>
<p>The Language Exhibition organized by the Chinese Language Education Association has been on display since the 3rd of this month. Due to the hard work of the people in charge of the meeting and the enthusiastic assistance of all sectors of society, precious treasures have been displayed, so the content is extremely rich. For a time, it caused a sensation in Chinese and foreign societies. As of yesterday, as many as</p>
<p>Nearly Ten Thousand People</p>
<p>More than 20 large, medium, and small schools have made special visits to attend classes and visit. The grand occasion is unprecedented and rare. In order to promote language education, the association has also published three special books written by famous writers and hired language experts to hold language lectures at the Sichuan Road Youth Association. The number of people buying special books and going to lectures has been particularly enthusiastic in recent days. It can be seen that this exhibition has had a great impact on the society and has a great impact on the promotion of language education.</p>
<p>Historical Value</p>
<p>The association's exhibition period is very short, and there are still many people who have not visited it. Therefore, all parties have requested to postpone it for a few days in recent days. However, because the exhibition period of the association will expire tonight, it will close at 7:00 p.m. tonight.</p>
<h3>Expanding the Aviation Industry, Preparing for Night Flights, China Aviation and Eurasia Airlines Plan to Add 12 Aircraft and Install Radio Navigators</h3>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War, our country has been trying to build transportation routes in various places to facilitate transportation. However, our national civil aviation industry has made rapid progress in recent years. Mail and passengers are transported by this means, and it is not stalled by Japanese aircraft attacking at any time. We are seeking to develop and expand. It is reported that China Aviation and Eurasia Airlines have purchased six of the latest aircraft from foreign countries and will continue to purchase six more, which will be distributed to various routes to carry passengers and freight. According to news from the transportation industry in this city yesterday, the current domestic civil aviation routes are 7,820 miles long. Although there were more than 30 aircraft before the war, there are still 22 aircraft at present. The two airlines are planning to set up equipment such as radio wave beacon navigation on the Chongqing-Hong Kong line and other routes to ensure the safety of passengers and goods and change the flight time. Everything is now being actively planned and improved. The airports in various places will be expanded as much as possible, and night navigation guidance devices will be provided to facilitate night flights. Therefore, the airmail sent to various places will be faster in the future, and there will be no more losses. The Shanghai Postal Administration is still temporarily suspending the receipt of airmail parcels.</p>
<h3>Lang Jingshan's Photography Exhibition Opens</h3>
<p>Opens at the Great World Tomorrow, Ticket Revenue to Rescue Disaster Victims</p>
<p>The famous photographer Mr. Lang Jingshan held a personal photography exhibition at Aurora University on the 14th of last month, which lasted only one day. It was not enough to satisfy the audience, and they asked to hold an exhibition again to make it more popular. Mr. Lang decided to hold an exhibition for three days on the fourth floor of the Great World Company after the language exhibition, exhibiting 142 famous photographic works, of which two-fifths are Sichuan landscapes and historical buildings, such as "Emei Golden Summit," "She Shen Cliff," "Golden Top Copper Tower," "Thousand Buddhas and Ten Thousand Buddhas Top," "Wuyou Temple," "Salt Well," "Xue Tao Well," etc., all of which are Mr. Lang's meticulous works. Mr. Lang is not only famous in China, but also has a considerable position in the international arena. Last year, he displayed 755 works in various countries, and 265 of them were selected for the salon book exhibition, winning 50 awards. He is indeed one of the best in the country. It is reported that each admission ticket costs 30 cents, and all the income will be transferred to the interior to relieve disaster victims. The "Special Issue" will also be sold in the hall for 3 yuan per copy. You can feast your eyes and do good deeds. I think the crowded situation in these three short days will be as expected. It is reported that the mainland, the Chinese Mail, and the Times, the Western newspapers in this port, will all publish special editions of two pages, with photos of Mr. Lang's famous works. It will close on the 15th.</p>
<h3>綸昌 Factory Strike - Early to Resolve</h3>
<p>Although the instigators of the labor strike have softened, they are adamant in demanding compensation and relief funds.</p>
<p>The labor strike at the British-owned Lun Chang Factory in Pudong is ongoing. Because many workers reside in Pudong, a unique environment, they lack autonomy. Consequently, neither labor nor management can directly negotiate a resolution after half a year of stalemate. The initiators of this strike originally hoped that after two or three months of strike, the factory's products would run out, and the factory would yield to their demands. Unexpectedly, for half a year, Lun Chang goods have still been sold on the market, with ample inventory, and there is no immediate</p>
<p>threat of running out of stock. On the contrary, the backers supporting the labor strike have been greatly depleted by the monthly payment of relief funds to skilled workers. Their attitude has softened considerably, and they are eager to negotiate a settlement with the factory. Their conditions are not as harsh as before. Recently, there have been multiple secret negotiations, but the instigators of the strike firmly demand that the factory bear the relief funds paid out over the past few months, and it is said that the amount demanded is</p>
<p>larger than the original amount.</p>
<p>Therefore, this point is the crux of why the case has not been resolved. Yesterday, in Pudong, "relief funds" were distributed to workers on the open ground of Dongchang Road. There is no immediate hope of resolving the labor strike. As for the reports that the Lun Chang labor strike can be resolved in the next two days, it is too early to say.</p>

<h3>Please Investigate Child Abductions</h3>
<p>Recently, child abduction in Shanghai has become rampant, initially most prevalent in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Road area, but now spreading to both Concessions. Citizens reporting the abduction of children to the police for investigation occur several times daily. The day before yesterday, two police stations received reports from the Ruan family residing at No. 18, Ximen Lane, Ximen Road, reporting the loss of a five-year-old boy named Ruan Qiankun, and from the Zhang family residing at No. 54, Yongji Lane, Weihaiwei Road, reporting the loss of a boy named Chen Shunyu, and so on.</p>
<h3>Xu Garden Owner Destroys Culture - 30,000 Books Damaged at Beixin - Forced Eviction by Landlord in Heavy Rain - Beixin Authorities Decide to Resolve Legally</h3>
<p>Before August 13th, the Beixin Bookstore rented Xu Garden on Kang Nao Tuo Road from the Xu Guan Yun and Xu Ling Yun brothers, the owners. After the war, Beixin demarcated part of the remaining houses as a refugee shelter, causing dissatisfaction among the landlords. They filed a complaint claiming Beixin Bookstore established Jianxing Middle School without their consent. Recently, relations have deteriorated daily. The Xu brothers ordered Beixin to vacate the premises. Beixin argued that the lease did not stipulate any unilateral right to terminate the agreement at will, and the monthly rent had never been in arrears, making it difficult to accept the demand. The two sides reached a stalemate. From the day before yesterday, the Xu brothers personally led dozens of workers to forcibly throw 130,000 books from Beixin out of Xu Garden daily, abandoning them in the rain, resulting in a loss of nearly 30,000 books. Li Zhiyun and Zhao Jingshen of Beixin witnessed the Xu brothers' destruction of culture and violent actions. In addition to moving the books elsewhere for sorting and preservation, they decided to present the entire process, along with photos taken, to the court to seek legal remedies.</p>
<h3>Receiving Public Funds but Not Appearing in Court for Defense - Lawyer Accused of Fraud - Summons Postponed for Further Verification Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhu Deben, a Yancheng native residing at No. 103, Qian Hu Jia Zhai, Hongqiao, Shanghai West, had a son arrested for theft in the Public Concession and sent to the Special First Court for trial. Shi Youfu, a lawyer introduced by Yang Jiming, a Chongming native residing nearby, was engaged to defend him. A fee of 220 yuan was agreed upon, with 100 yuan paid in advance and the remainder to be paid upon conclusion of the case. Unexpectedly, Zhu's son was sentenced to 18 years in prison, but Shi Youfu, after accepting the commission,</p>
<p>did not appear in court</p>
<p>to defend him. Zhu then negotiated with the original introducer, Yang Jiming, to recover the 100 yuan paid. This led to violence, with Yang reporting to the French Concession police that he was assaulted by Zhu. The police sent both parties to the Special Second Court for prosecution. As a result, Zhu was found not guilty and released. Now, Zhu Deben has filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Yang Jiming and lawyer Shi Youfu of jointly</p>
<p>defrauding him of money</p>
<p>and requesting a legal investigation. According to the complaint, the court, yesterday morning, had Judge Zhu Chuzhe open the court to summon the parties. The plaintiff, Zhu Deben, and the defendant, Yang Jiming, did not appear because the summons had not been delivered. Only the second defendant, lawyer Shi Youfu, arrived with his defense lawyer, Huang Zengjie. According to Shi, after accepting the case, "I was in court for another case and could not go to the First Special Court, so I</p>
<p>appointed a sub-agent</p>
<p>to defend him." The judge said that according to law, criminal cases could not appoint sub-agents and that there were illegalities and ordered the summon to be rescheduled for the 24th for further verification.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Manager and Accountant - Collusion and Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Shop owner discovers and sues for embezzlement; defendants deny the matter.</p>
<p>Zou Juntai, a 30-year-old Wuxi native, invested 5,000 yuan in February of this year to open the Yongfengsheng Rice Shop at No. 997 Fuxu Road in the French Concession. He hired his fellow villager Bi Haoru as manager and Bi's nephew, Bi Liangchen, as accountant. The business was relatively prosperous. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, the Bi uncle and nephew both resigned and opened their own business. Now, Zou Juntai has discovered in the shop's accounts that Bi Haoru and Bi Liangchen, uncle and nephew, have engaged in embezzlement. After unsuccessful negotiations,</p>
<p>he hired a lawyer as agent and filed a criminal self-suit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court against Bi Haoru and Bi Liangchen for joint embezzlement and breach of trust. It is claimed that there are three points (1) a balance of 313 yuan, 3 jiao, 5 fen, and 3 li was found in the cash flow account, which was not handed over, (2) ten shi of goods were purchased from Yuan Yuchang Rice Shop, totaling 195 yuan, but investigations with Yuan Yuchang found no such transaction, as evidenced by a reply from the shop, (3) one shi of white rice was sold to Yu Shiliang on August 18th, priced at 29 yuan, but the account only recorded 20 yuan, with 9 yuan embezzled. Based on the above three points, a total of 513 yuan, 3 jiao, 5 fen, and 3 li has been embezzled, and a request is made to investigate the matter according to law, with a civil suit attached to recover the embezzled funds, etc. According to the complaint, the court, yesterday afternoon, had Judge Miao Qingbang open the court for preliminary examination. First, the plaintiff, accompanied by a lawyer, arrived to state the embezzlement process and presented two account books as evidence. The defendants, accompanied by a defense lawyer, arrived and denied any breach of trust or embezzlement. After a lengthy detailed inquiry by the court, the matter was adjourned for investigation and further interrogation.</p>

<h3>"Daxi" Lottery Tickets to be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>The "Daxi" toothpaste produced by the Yecheng Industrial Society has excellent quality, is affordable, and its name suits the psychology of the Chinese people. Since its launch, sales have been exceptionally good. The tin tube includes gift coupons for 500 yuan, 200 yuan, 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and toothpaste and tooth powder. Last month, in addition to major companies such as Xinxin and Wing On selling huge amounts of gift coupons, on October 29th, an old woman from Miaoxiang Chamber of Painting in Sanma Road Huajin Lane sold a 500-yuan gift coupon. The winner, Mr. Yuan Dingqi from Xiamen Road, together with the staff of the old Miaoxiang, went to the society to redeem the full amount. Now there is another 500-yuan coupon placed in the tin tube, waiting for users to claim it. It is rumored that three other types of toothpaste, including "Shuangxi," "Yongbei," and "Children," will be launched soon for use by various sectors of society. The above three types of toothpaste have unique fragrances and are made of extremely high-quality materials. The children's toothpaste also includes children's science games, divided into mechanics, optics, acoustics, electricity, and so on. The society will issue a commemorative "Daxi" ticket for the above three types of toothpaste starting from the first of next month. Each month, the lottery will be based on the numbers announced by the Central Savings Society. Every ticket wins something. The number of tickets issued will be based on the number of tickets issued by the Central Savings Society, without issuing extra tickets to deceive compatriots. Each month, there are more than 5,700 winning numbers. In addition to cash and toothpaste gifts, the winning numbers can also receive charitable lottery tickets, with an income of 75,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Car Crashes into Store - Ciyou Pharmacy's Windows and Cabinets Damaged - Three Employees and Driver Injured</h3>

<h3>Pushan Villa - Performing Plays to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>Pushan Villa in this city spares no effort in burial work and has achieved remarkable results. It buries tens of thousands of corpses exposed on the streets every year. The expenses for coffins, etc., have always relied on the donations of philanthropists from all walks of life. However, in recent years, due to the war, the mortality rate has been increasing, and the work of the villa has become more arduous. The expenses required have also increased several times. The original funds are clearly insufficient. Hai Shang philanthropists Yuan Ludeng, Le Feibao, Wang Peiyuan, Wu Ruisheng, and Li Wencai, in view of this, in order to strengthen the work of the villa and raise funds for coffins, have specially initiated an invitation to famous performers and actors to perform plays at the Grand Stage on November 28th to raise donations. Yesterday, Mr. Le Gengbao also hosted a banquet at Yuebinlou Restaurant to entertain the famous performers and actors participating in the play. The grand occasion will definitely be unprecedented, and it is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will actively support it. Those who need to purchase play tickets can purchase them in advance from Pushan Villa on Liu Ma Road. It is truly a charitable act with boundless merit.</p>

<h3>Letter from Chaozhou Heji Hospital</h3>
<p>Recently, I read in your newspaper a news item about the death of Chen Lin's suicide by poisoning. The part about our hospital is factually inaccurate, which is deeply shocking. On the 20th of last month, Lin Zhaokun and others accompanied his sister, Chen Lin, to our hospital for treatment. When she arrived at the hospital, Chen Lin had already died. Our hospital doctors did not treat her at all. How could there be any talk of giving two injections of a heart stimulant? At that time, the deceased had already died when she arrived at the hospital. Our hospital believed that there was no need for examination, so our hospital does not know how Chen Lin died. It was neither intentional concealment nor a violation of regulations. As for the accusation of bribery, it is even more malicious slander, which is outrageous. Our hospital is a charitable hospital for the Chaozhou community in Shanghai, and its purpose is to relieve the poor and sick and benefit the people. The unwarranted suspicion concerns our reputation and cannot be tolerated in silence. We have sent a special letter to you, hoping that your newspaper will investigate and publish a correction to correct the record. We are greatly indebted to you. Sincerely, Chaozhou Heji Hospital, November 11th.</p>

The market was closed in the afternoon for Saturday, but it was heard that the off-market trend remained flat, with some transactions at 3710 yuan. The final price was 3715 yuan asked by sellers and 3705 yuan bid by buyers. The trading volume in the half-day was slightly thin, around eight or nine hundred taels. Silver shop ornaments gold remained unchanged. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>"Boiled Red" Only Fell Nine Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each tael (ten taels) opened with a rather sluggish start, because a certain gold firm came to depress the price for selling. At that time, the US exchange rate was reported to be rising, causing buyers to wait and see. When the market opened at 9:25, the price was depressed by twenty-seven yuan. A certain gold firm sold thirty taels to a money exchange business for 3690 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange business seized the opportunity to buy, immediately recovering ten yuan. A certain money exchange business purchased fifty taels from a securities firm for 3700 yuan. At that time, another money exchange business and a certain cash firm each sold dozens of taels, depressing the price again to 3690 yuan. After this, a certain silver shop suddenly absorbed more than three hundred taels on behalf of Hong Kong firms. Bullish retail investors took the opportunity to raise prices, and soon it rose by twenty-three yuan. A certain silver shop bought ten taels from a money exchange business, and a total of thirty taels from fellow businesses, all for 3713 yuan. At this time, Hong Kong firms once stopped buying, and soon fell back ten yuan. Money exchange businesses sold twenty taels to silver shop firms for 3703 yuan. Later, Hong Kong firms started buying again, and it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was slightly softening, so they pulled it up again by seventeen yuan. A certain silver shop bought twenty taels from a money exchange business for 3720 yuan. Soon, a securities firm suddenly came to sell, and certain gold firms and silver shop firms also frequently dumped their holdings. In addition, Hong Kong firms had eaten their fill and lacked maintenance, so the price plummeted by thirty yuan, reaching a low of 3690 yuan. At that time, a certain silver shop came to bid again, and sellers were immediately scarce, jumping fifteen yuan. A certain silver shop bought twenty taels from a certain gold firm for 3705 yuan. Later, it continued to rise by five yuan. A securities firm purchased ten taels from a money exchange business for 3710 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold firm sold thirty taels to a money exchange business for 3708 yuan, which was the noon closing price. The market was closed in the afternoon for Saturday, and as a result, it continued to fall by nine yuan compared to the previous day. The fluctuation was thirty yuan in the half-day. The selling price of cash firm's capital gold was ten yuan higher than "boiled red". The buying price had to be reduced by more than twenty yuan. The current bid gold was about fifty yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Unchanged All Day</p>
<p>The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael did not change all day. Da Tong Heng still hung at 375 yuan. The new firms had the same price as the top price, and the buying price was reduced by about fifteen yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Turnaround, Foreign Bonds and Foreign Stocks Show Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday's dark market situation for securities showed a gradual turnaround. Although the rebound of various bonds was slight, the trend was extremely stable. The morale of various firms was also showing signs of improvement. However, because both today and tomorrow are holidays, trading was stopped in the afternoon, failing to fully display their strengths, but it still slowly trended upward in the dark. This is because the relationship between the United States and Japan has not only failed to improve, but there are signs of deterioration. The Soviet-Japanese relationship is merely perfunctory. Furthermore, with the Anglo-American-Soviet statement of continued aid and the rumor that Shanghai banknotes are not allowed to be imported has virtually disappeared. The number of short positions in the market is accumulating more and more. Most of the borrowed goods will inevitably be reclaimed, forming a lightly loaded boat, which will capsize even without wind and waves. Therefore, cunning individuals are slowly covering their positions. A rebound is not far off. It is truly due to the change in the environment and the overcrowding of short positions in the market. Yesterday, only half-day trading was conducted in the morning, because today is Sunday and tomorrow is a make-up holiday for the Premier's birthday, making settlement inconvenient. Yesterday afternoon, half-day trading was stopped. Because Yishihao, Dafeng Tongsheng, and retail investors bought in succession, although Jiufeng Datong Tiansheng, etc., still had sales, the number was small, and the trend was quite firm. As a result, it rebounded by five cents, one dime, to three dimes. The total number of transactions was thirty to forty thousand yuan. The 13th is a make-up holiday for the Premier's birthday. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stocks: Xin Xin Company shares traded 100 shares, priced at 5.8 yuan.</p>
<p>News from Europe is of little benefit to the stock market. Looking at the trading process of the various industry guilds yesterday morning, sellers were more dominant. The opening market situation was unstable, with prices fluctuating in a narrow range, and some tending downward. Trading turned slightly lighter. Stocks such as Yeguang Real Estate, International Trust, Ruirong Steel, and Shanghai Silver Company, when prices began to decline, received considerable support from the buy-side.</p>
<p>London, 10th: Today, the listed prices of various Far East British companies' stocks saw a slight decline. Jardine Matheson Bank shares fell 2 shillings and 6 pence to £8 12s 6d. HSBC Hong Kong registered shares fell £1 to £84. Kaiping Coal Mines shares fell 1 shilling to 18 shillings. Gula-Kalumpang Rubber shares fell 11 pence to 18s 1d. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 10th: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds saw a decline in the upper range of customs tax and Boxer Indemnity guaranteed bonds. Bonds such as Anglo-German Continuation (British Issue), Sino-French US Dollar, and Reconstruction (British Issue) each fell £2. Anglo-German Continuation was £55, Sino-French US Dollar was £50, Reconstruction was £40. Li Tax guaranteed bonds, only Vickers fell £1 to £12, the rest remained stable. In the lower range, railway public bonds, Beining Railway, uniquely rose £2 to £52, the rest remained at the original price.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Coarse Yarn Sales to the South Active</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the trend has entered a hovering state again, but the general public's psychology is still optimistic. Because the Indian and American cotton markets have been gradually rising recently, there are quite a few people doing long and buying in. Unfortunately, business is not picking up, which is somewhat disappointing. As for the actual demand, the consumption of fine yarn in South China is still sluggish. The procurement of 10-count coarse yarn continues unabated, and large quantities are purchased directly from factories. Currently, judging from the overall trend, it should be seen as rising based on overseas cotton prices. However, the exchange rate is stable and long, and in addition, the inventory in various godowns is sufficient, and sales are not strong, so the two are temporarily offset.</p>
<p>The opening price of spot yarn in the morning inherited the previous day's false bullish momentum, but the exchange rate was flat. 20-count Double Horse opened at 648 yuan, and fell to 643 yuan in a moment. Later, due to rising foreign cotton, it was said that it was possible to buy and do long, and it slowly recovered to 650 yuan. Finally, it was heard that the exchange rate had softened, and in addition, customer sales were still slow, so it weakened again. The half-day turnover was statistically 1,091 bales. Double Horse fell by 3 yuan, Tian Nu fell by 2 yuan, and Double Globe fell by 2 yuan. The factory side Yong'an Factory opened 150 bales of 10-count Te Jincheng, priced at 550 yuan. The amount bought by each firm is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow Firms 625 Hong Kong 410</p>
<p>Inland 30 Xiamen 15</p>
<p>Statistics 1,296 Ningbo 11</p>
<p>Previous Day Turnover 205</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Frequently Rises Unceasingly, Local Cotton Transactions Improve</h3>
<p>Local cotton transactions continued to improve. Factories, Shenxin, and Xinyu factories also launched procurement for white bales. As for fellow businesses, in view of the gradual rise in the American and Indian cotton markets, morale is increasingly upright. Fortunately, the foreign exchange rate is stable and slightly looser, so the cotton market has not started a rising wind, but it has turned into a firm and expensive path. The sources of northern Jiangsu include 895 bales of Tong Cotton, 1,024 bales of Changyinsha, and 1,840 bales of Beisha. The current spot cotton situation is listed below:</p>
<p>(Current spot cotton transactions by fellow businesses are all ex-godown, factory transactions include delivery to the factory, packaging, drying, and water value).</p>
<p>Haiti Superior 125.00 125.50 Fellow Businesses Purchased 650 bales</p>
<p>Wooden Frame Fire Machine 125.50 Again 180 bales</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 124.50 Again 250 bales</p>
<p>Tong Cotton 131.00 133.60 Again 1,000 bales</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 132.00 Xinyu Purchased 1,000 dan</p>
<p>Tong Cotton 139.00 Again 1,000 dan</p>
<p>Fire Machine Wooden Frame 131.00 Shen Er Purchased 220 bales</p>
<p>Donggou Cotton 131.00 Again 200 bales</p>
<p>Changyinsha 136.00 Again 600 bales</p>
<p>Another News: Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai were quiet, as fluctuating exchange rates made it difficult for all parties to grasp. Factories' purchase of foreign cotton had also turned sluggish. Although fellow businesses had a strong buying intention, no open trading was heard. Recently, Japanese factories have gradually become more active, with over 1,000 bales of American cotton traded daily. The American cotton previously ordered by various parties will arrive in Shanghai successively in the second half of this month.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was initially very firm in the morning. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reported good news, and morale was extremely excited. Speculators were actively buying in the market, so the market situation was very strong. Later, cotton prices rose again due to purchases from fellow businesses. As a result, the closing price rose by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. The forecast for Indian cotton was up by more than four rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by more than twenty pounds. Liverpool rose by more than ten pence.</p>
<h3>Grains: Wildly Raising Kejian, Japonica Rice is Stimulated to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sources from various firms included 13 boats of Hexia goods from the Nangang firm, and 6 trucks of Suzhou-Tongzhou package goods, 9 trucks from Kunshan, 5 trucks from Taicang Shuangfeng, and more than 10 trucks of Qing-Si Fengjia goods, totaling 3,300 to 3,400 packages. The sources from all routes are still limited during the season of the upcoming St. Andrew's and Xiwang period, and morale is rising. Therefore, the japonica market has been showing a hovering trend in recent days, without any signs of depreciation. Moreover, with the continuous rise of kejian, japonica rice has also been raised. Yesterday, the stores in this street were even more active, competing to buy without weakening, and hoarding households also highlighted the search. The situation was turbulent, and the cargo owners took the opportunity to raise prices sharply, raising half a yuan at Hengda, resulting in the japonica price rising by more than one yuan compared to the previous one. The closing price of regular-grade Zhente japonica was 31 yuan, high-grade was 30.05 yuan to 30 yuan, medium-grade goods were 28-29 yuan, and there were scattered transactions of Yao Lvzhong, also increasing by six to seven jiao. Nangang early rice was also the same, with Luxiangjian sales being particularly strong, also rising by about one yuan.</p>
<p>The source of kejian has been cut off, and the stock in the godown is less than 7,000 packages. Therefore, the cargo owners are determined to raise prices sharply. On the one hand, customers, hoarding households, and scalpers are advancing in succession, transferring to each other, and raising prices step by step. The sensational situation has not been seen in recent months. As a result, the closing price of Jiangbei superior-grade kejian was 25.4 yuan to 25.2 yuan, and Jingwu superior-grade was 25.5 yuan to 24.8 yuan, each rising by more than one yuan. The price of big rice also showed strength, rising by half a yuan. In total, the transaction volume of the market did not fall below 12,000 to 13,000 packages.</p>
<p>Another news: Kejian is becoming more sharp, because in the midst of demand exceeding supply, morale was already upward, and hoarding households started to absorb it. Local customers greedily arranged for price releases, and the market rose several times a day. Japonica rice, which is the main consumption in this city, is difficult to compete with, and it has created a situation of turning the guest into the host. According to yesterday, although the supply of japonica rice was said to be less and prices rose, it was actually stimulated by the rising prices of kejian in the past few days. The sales of Duxiang superior grade were also due to the shortage of kejian and the switch to buying local superior grade. There has been a lack of kejian for a long time. Although there were small-scale shipments by vendors in the past few days, they were all small-batch test shipments of dozens or a hundred packages. It is said that Japanese merchants have not had a whole batch arriving for many days, so there has been no smooth shipment in the past few days. Yesterday, the market was active, but the transaction volume was still less than 4,000 packages. The demand for local customers was strong, and the large buyers competed to buy, so the price was stimulated to rise by 1.2-1.3 yuan. Although the later market turned slightly stable, the selling price of high kejian has reached 25.3-25.5 yuan, which is close to the low-grade japonica rice.</p>
<h3>Flour Market in Brewing</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour transaction was not lonely. Although it was the weekend, Qingdao merchants' sales were slightly active. Retail transactions on this street were also slightly more greedy than before, and the market is still brewing. The No. 2 flour factory continued to open at 7.3 yuan, the original price. The sheller brand continued to require 7.4 yuan. There were few return goods coming and going, and the selling price was a small angle difference compared to the factory disk. The source of domestic miscellaneous brand flour is endless, and the price is at 6.6-6.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat: After the slight pullback the day before, each factory intended to suppress the price for purchase. However, the cargo side was not too accommodating. As a result, both sides still held each other. The whole market still only Fufeng Factory slightly purchased 6,000 packages of wheat from Suxi Changdan, and the price was again reduced by 3-5 points.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Shrimp Tails Arrival and Inventory Both Rare</h3>
<p>Recently, in the market, the arrival of various grades of shrimp tails is small, and the bottom inventory is also rare. However, due to the high selling price, transactions are sparse, showing a sluggishness. The current market price of Jinshan tails is 270 yuan, Jiangbei Xiao Kaiyang is 120 yuan to 140 yuan. The rest of the varieties are all lacking.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Miscellaneous Longans Rise by Seven or Eight Yuan</h3>
<p>Only 50 boxes of miscellaneous longan arrived on the Sichuan wheel the day before. It is also worth noting that the Xinghua side must settle foreign exchange before exporting, and the cost is getting higher and higher, with no continuation, so the market is very tight. I heard yesterday that the firm has already opened, and it has risen by seven or eight yuan compared to the previous.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Obstruction of Dutch Sugar Sources, Coarse Sugar Rises Again by About One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, with another tension message from the Netherlands and a relationship with the source, morale went up. The association drew a disk and spot 24 coarse whites rose by one and a half to one yuan again, and the company's godown was 52 yuan. The outside godown was initially 52 yuan to 52.5 yuan, and then rose to 53 yuan, and then slightly Xie, still to 52.5 yuan, and the transfer cargo rose by one yuan to 41.5 yuan. According to a Hong Kong telegram, Taikoo Che Bai, Ningbo helped to set up 5,000 bags of B mark, and Shanghai delivery, the price was HK$16.55, up 3.5 angles from the previous, and Shenshi continued to rise by half a yuan, B mark was 55.5-56 yuan, CW mark 55.5 yuan, CX mark 55 yuan, DY mark 54 yuan, HX mark 53.5 yuan, H mark car 41 yuan, Dutch Red 42 yuan, all up one yuan, Ben Mian White No. 1 52 yuan, the rest were refunded, No. 1 Ice 62.5 yuan, Jingming Ice 64 yuan, all up Yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Cotton Cloth Difficult to Rise or Fall</h3>
<p>The cloth market is mediocre in current sales, and the price is lower than that of yarn and cotton, so although the inventory is prosperous, the selling plate is difficult to fall or rise, showing a hovering situation, and the future trend depends on the current sales. Yesterday, the market prices of white goods and dyed goods were slightly tired, and each foot returned to a small five to two corners. Those who urgently wanted to sell the goods sold at a low of three or five corners per market. The vendors from eastern Zhejiang, Wen, Yong, and Tai procured 150-60 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, colored cloth, and colored diagonal, and the Min vendors procured 40-50 pieces of colored diagonal, line woolen, and serge. The Cantonese and Hong Kong vendors procured 100 pieces of fine diagonal, coarse cloth, and fine cloth. Vendors in this street procured 200 pieces of serge, colored cloth, flannel, grey cloth, and coarse cloth. Overseas Singapore Mumbai handled 2,000 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and colored diagonal.</p>
<p>The white goods market in Dong Pi is still difficult to improve. The current market price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is still fluctuating between 18.4 yuan, because the actual sales are sluggish, and most of the market transactions are subject to the rise and fall of foreign exchange. Yesterday, the total transaction volume of fellow businesses in this street was 400-500 pieces. Customer sales are still depressed. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge is sold at six corners per yard. According to observations from fellow businesses, it is difficult to be optimistic in the short term.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Market Temporarily Hovers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil market, in addition to the Kobe Dalian barrel oil market, which was hesitant to open, the other basket oils rose slightly by 2-3 angles. The current market situation is temporarily hovering. Blue barrel oil is in the hands of bullish companies, and there is no hope of cheap selling for a while, so although the code of basket oil is loosening, it is inevitable that people's hearts are restrained, resulting in a hard foot. Yesterday, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were transacted (for details, see the market price column), 200 pieces of Yanqi oil, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil, 20 barrels of white squeezed oil, and 100 tins of canned squeezed oil. Although the Hong Kong side saw the continued handling of peanut oil, the seller was afraid of being affected due to the exchange rate relationship, so he took the aim of taking a tour. The market price has not changed, and it is estimated that 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil will be opened, priced at 57 yuan, the original price, and 20 barrels of Tianjin barrel oil, and the price will also be opened at the original price of 74 yuan.</p>
<p>It was found that there were 250 packages of soybeans from Beisha to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal: Pusteel Coal's Outward Route is Prosperous</h3>
<p>Shuiding smokeless coal is short of supply because the source of Kailuan coal is not extensive. Although there are large quantities of Indian coal stored in the market, it is not easy to promote due to the high price. Only fixed-grade goods are easier to handle, so yesterday Pusteel coal sales were very prosperous. Fellow businesses deconstructed the price, which is estimated to be 76 yuan per ton for screen blocks, 72 yuan for unified coal, and 60 yuan for coal chips. Pusteel warehouse delivery plus the industry bar.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tinplate Shortage</h3>
<p>The tinplate market was once quiet a few days ago. Yesterday, customer sales were active, with 26-gauge goods dominating. Dozens of boxes were searched by Qindao and Yantai customers. There were also quite a few lock factories and yarn mills in this street. However, 24-gauge goods are in short supply in the current market, and those with goods hoard them. The selling price is still about 900 yuan. Only 26-gauge patterns are currently traded in large quantities, and several manufacturers directly purchased them from overseas.</p>

<h3>The Southwest, Anti-Japanese Base Area</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>To Understand the Southwest, We Must Pay Attention to the Following Issues</p>
<p>The so-called Southwest refers to the provinces of Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. These provinces are part of our rear area of the Anti-Japanese War, and also the foundation for our future revival. We rely heavily on these places for our financial resources and troop supplies. To achieve these goals, we must pay attention to:</p>
<p>Economic Development Issues</p>
<p>Although these areas have not been developed in the past due to national difficulties, the underground deposits are extremely rich. How to develop resources and increase our economic power in the Anti-Japanese War is naturally an urgent task. However, China's financial resources have always been concentrated in the Southeast, and the financial resources of the Southwest are much worse than those of the Southeast. Moreover, due to the inconvenience of transportation, the import of machinery, and the recruitment of skilled workers, considerable difficulties have arisen. However, these difficulties are not insurmountable. First, the Central Government can encourage capitalists from Shanghai and the Southeast occupied areas to invest in the interior. Second, overseas Chinese can be encouraged to return to China to invest. Third, foreign capital can be utilized. These three aspects have achieved satisfactory results in recent times, and the industrial development of the interior has also made considerable progress. For example, there are woolen mills, silk mills, and sugar factories in Sichuan, and the establishment of copper smelting plants and chemical plants in Yunnan, and the establishment of mercury mines in Guizhou. Other examples include the area near the Jialing River in Sichuan, which has become the center of factories recently moved in from various places, and the ongoing hydropower generation projects and underground deposit development projects. All of this shows that the Southwest development of China's new economic base has shown a booming atmosphere. Naturally, we cannot be satisfied with such a situation. We also hope that our industrialists, financiers, and overseas Chinese will move more of the floating capital concentrated in the Southeast or overseas into the interior to jointly build the country.</p>
<p>Agricultural Improvement Issues</p>
<p>The cultivable area of the Southwest is 260 million mu, of which 31.7 million mu have been cultivated, accounting for 15% of the total area. At a time when the nation's food supply is insufficient due to the loss of rice-producing areas in the Southeast, we should expand the cultivated area and increase food production to achieve self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Troop Training and Replenishment Issues</p>
<p>Guangxi, Sichuan, and Hunan provinces have always been the troop centers in the process of the Chinese revolution. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the heroic young men of these provinces have also shed their blood for the country. How to organize the masses, give full play to self-defense capabilities, and train the people of all provinces to become defenders of the country. In the past, Guangxi's militia training has achieved significant results. The implementation of the total mobilization after the Anti-Japanese War, the efforts of national military training, and the implementation of conscript training have all achieved good results. The formation of new troops for counterattack will of course depend on the Southwest provinces a lot.</p>
<p>Education Issues for the Miao and Yao Ethnic Minorities</p>
<p>The Miao and Yao ethnic minorities scattered in the Southwest provinces are numerous. Since the war against Japan, these ethnic groups have also volunteered to kill the enemy and served the country, which is a very touching phenomenon. In the future, we must raise their culture and improve their economy in accordance with Mr. Zhongshan's national principles for these culturally backward compatriots in the country. In this way, we can achieve ethnic harmony and make our pace of unanimous resistance to foreign aggression more close.</p>
<p>The above points are the issues that we should pay attention to for the Southwest construction today.</p>
<p>Population and Area Table of the Six Southwest Provinces</p>
<h3>Southwest Anti-Japanese War Figures</h3>
<p>Li Zongren</p>
<p>General Li Zongren, courtesy name Delin, was born in Guilin, Guangxi, in 1890. He graduated from Guilin Military Academy. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the commander of the Seventh Army of the National Revolutionary Army. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Jiujiang in the 25th year (likely of the Republic) and the Battle of Longtan in the 26th year. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he led his troops out of Guangxi and engaged the enemy. He decisively defeated the Japanese army in the Battle of Taierzhuang, becoming a military leader respected throughout the country. General Li is still working tirelessly for the country on the front lines of northern Hubei. Northern Hubei has become an impregnable fortress for the past year. Japanese attacks have all suffered disastrous defeats. General Li's contribution is truly significant.</p>
<p>Bai Chongxi</p>
<p>General Bai Chongxi, courtesy name Jiansheng, was born in Guilin, Guangxi, in 1893. He graduated from Baoding Military Academy and participated in the Xinhai Revolution in his early years. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the commander of the Thirteenth Army. In 1927, he served as the Garrison Commander of Songhu. Later, he led his troops north and captured Xuzhou, an important town on the Jinpu Railway. After 1928, he returned to Guangxi to assist Li Zongren in building a new Guangxi, handling important tasks such as organizing local militias. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Guangxi soldiers were able to be generous and sacrifice themselves for the country, which was due to the usual merits of Generals Li and Bai. Since the Anti-Japanese War, General Bai has traveled to various battlefields, directing and arranging deployments, with great effort and high merit. General Bai is one of China's few military staff talents and is known as "Little Zhuge." Since the Japanese army landed at Daya Bay in Guangdong last year and occupied Guangzhou, and occupied Hainan Island this year, attempting to plot against Guangxi from Beihai, the situation in the two Guangs (Guangdong and Guangxi) is extremely critical. Therefore, the National Government specially appointed General Bai as the Deputy Director of Pacification of Guangxi in April of this year to defend Guangxi and prevent the Japanese from acting rashly.</p>
<p>He Yingqin</p>
<p>General He Yingqin, courtesy name Jingzhi, was born in Qianxi, Guizhou, in 1889. He graduated from the Tokyo Military Academy in Japan. He joined the Tongmenghui in his early years, and also participated in the overthrow of the Manchu Qing government during the Xinhai Revolution. From 1920 to 1923, he served as the principal of the Yunnan Military Academy. In 1914, he served as the Dean of Education at the Huangpu Military Academy. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the commander of the Eastern Route Army, taking Jiangxi and conquering Fujian. In 1926, he served as the acting chairman of the Fujian Provisional Provincial Government. Later, he led his troops north again, arrived in Zhejiang, defeated Sun Chuanfang's army, and completely eliminated Sun Chuanfang's forces in the Battle of Longtan with Generals Li and Bai. In 1928, he served as the chairman of the Provisional Zhejiang Provincial Government. After 1926, he was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee, and after 1930, he was appointed as the Minister of Military Administration until now.</p>
<p>Long Yun</p>
<p>General Long Yun, courtesy name Zhizhou, was born in Zhaotong, Yunnan, in 1888. In the early years of the Republic, he graduated from the Yunnan Military Academy, served as a senior army officer, and participated in the National Protection War and the Constitutional Protection War. In the 16th year (likely of the Republic), he was appointed by the central government as a member of the Military Affairs Committee of the National Revolutionary Army, the commander-in-chief of the Thirteenth Route Army, and concurrently the chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the Yunnan Army also traveled thousands of miles to fight in Shanghai. In the Battle of Taierzhuang, the Yunnan Army also fought against the Japanese together with other central troops and achieved an unprecedented victory. Now Yunnan is a base for China's revival. General Long is rectifying military and political affairs and developing industries, laying the foundation for national recovery. The central government relies heavily on him.</p>
<p>Yang Sen</p>
<p>General Yang Sen, from Guang'an, Sichuan, was born in 1887. He graduated from the Yunnan Military Academy. Participated in the National Protection War. In 1927, he served as the commander-in-chief of the Fifth Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army. When he was in Sichuan, General Yang worked extremely hard to develop industries and open up road transportation. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, General Yang once led the Sichuan Army east to the banks of the Huangpu River to fight against the invaders, establishing great achievements. During the defense of Wuhan, the Sichuan Army guarded Wuning Luopan Mountain between Hunan and Jiangxi, preventing the Japanese army from invading southward. In the future, General Yang and his commanded Twentieth Army, like all other anti-Japanese generals in China, will be immortalized in the glorious history of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Paper</h3>
<p>At present, paper prices are soaring, and transportation is very inconvenient, so all provinces in the interior use local paper, especially Sichuan paper, which is popular in various places. Sichuan paper is produced by the Jiale Paper Mill in Leshan County. The factory was opened in the fifteenth year of the Republic (likely), by Wang Huaizhong, a student who studied in France, with a capital of 60,000 yuan. It has now increased to 140,000 yuan. In the past, its exquisite products and low prices were well-known. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the National Government moved west, and the population in the southwest suddenly increased, so the demand increased sharply. Currently, the factory can produce more than one ton of paper per day. Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has also lent 100,000 yuan to purchase machinery and expand the scope. The planned output is 30,000 tons per day. The main raw material for papermaking is rice straw. Most of it is transported from Jiajiang, Danlu, Hongya and other places. It is definitely wood pulp, commonly known as Xiangbingzi. Sometimes paper scraps are also mixed in.</p>
<p>In addition to the Jiale Factory, Sichuan has a total of 165 white paper workshops. There are 315 straw paper workshops. But they are all small-scale operations, small in size, and cannot be used for newspapers. Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to change the paper used for superstitious purposes into writing paper, and change the local writing paper into printing paper. It is also manufactured by machines and is currently underway.</p>
<p>In addition to Sichuan, Kunming, Yunnan, also has the establishment of the Dianfeng Paper Mill, which was founded in the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic by Qian Xinzhi and Jin Runxiang with a capital of 1.4 million yuan. It ordered machinery from Germany. The planned output is five tons per day, half for use in the province and half for export to Guangxi and Guizhou, but due to raw materials and other reasons, it has not yet started.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Neijiang</h3>
<p>— Three Three</p>
<p>Neijiang is located west of Chongqing and is the center of the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway. Departing from Chongqing by car in the morning, having lunch at Laifengyi or Yong'anzhen, you can probably reach Neijiang around 6 pm.</p>
<p>It is one of the famous sugar-producing areas in Sichuan, the area is rich, and the market is quite prosperous. Several main streets are also paved with cement, which is quite tidy and clean. Banks such as China, China Farmers, Sichuan Salt Industry, and Chuankang Pingmin have branches here, and the most numerous are naturally sugar shops. This is probably because it is a sugar-producing area? There are also two or three large hotels, most of which are converted from ancestral halls. The China Travel Service also entrusts a hotel here as a reception center, but the location seems a bit remote and not good. Compared with hotels in big cities such as Shanghai, these hotels can naturally be said to be too simple, but for inns in the interior where "cocks crow early to see the sky, and lodge early if it's not late," they are really warm. There are also four or five restaurants, and chicken and fish are famous for being delicious. If you order a spicy chicken, a pot of spicy crucian carp, and half a catty of Maotai Daqu, and chat with a few good friends, that's comfortable enough! However, due to the richness of the place and the large number of merchants coming and going, an inevitable phenomenon is that private prostitutes also follow. They can be seen everywhere in restaurants and hotels, and there is also a kind of itinerant prostitute who travels between Zigong - a famous salt-producing area in Sichuan, which is also a very rich place - and Neijiang. Most of these are first-class beauties, specializing in entertaining wealthy merchants and magnates. The author once saw Ms. Liu, one of the best of them, at a banquet hosted by the manager of a large bank in the area. She was wearing a coat, carrying a leather bag, and even spoke a few sentences of Sichuan English. She was indeed graceful and elegant. Although she was not as modern as a Shanghai modern girl, she was at least better than the two Jiangbei compatriots at the entrance of the Great World. On the other hand, what is as bad in Neijiang as in other places is the lack of toilets, which really makes people from Shanghai and other places greatly unaccustomed. They are all a few holes dug underground, with two not-so-wide wooden boards placed on top. You are invited to stand on the top when you defecate. In case you stand for a while and feel sore and numb, and your legs are not strong, if you are not careful, you will be covered in gold. And the surrounding filth and mess, of course, cannot be mentioned. Although there are chamber pots, they are only for women, and men do not have this right. However, if you ask, you can be specially allowed to use it temporarily. However, this kind of chamber pot is made of tile, almost like a jar, with a very small opening. It is inconvenient to urinate when defecating, and it is inconvenient to defecate when urinating. If urination and defecation come at the same time, both pipes are flowing, although it cannot be said to be impossible, it is very dangerous.</p>
<p>Because it is a sugar-producing area, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Sichuan Provincial Government's Department of Construction jointly established an alcohol factory here, using sugar feet to refine alcohol and replace gasoline. The host is Mr. Wei Yanshou, an engineer from the former Shanghai Pudong Alcohol Factory. Due to financial difficulties, the equipment is very simple. Steel pipes are used instead of steel pipes, iron buckets are used instead of iron buckets, and all machines are rebuilt in Chongqing themselves, with very few coming from abroad. The staff are also very young and very motivated. They start working at six or seven o'clock every morning. Among the dozens of state-run factories and mines of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, this is the most successful and the only factory that can make a profit every year. In addition, there is also a sugarcane test site, which is also hosted by a student who studied in the United States, Mr. So-and-so. According to him, the current test results show that the Javanese variety is the best, sweeter than Guangdong sugarcane and has more water. It will be planted on a large scale in the future. At the same time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is also preparing to establish a large-scale new-style sugar factory here, but because the machines ordered from foreign countries cannot be transported to Sichuan, it is now only possible to compare, test, and improve the latest and small-scale machines in the traditional sugar-making methods. After seeing this, the author realized that these many promising young people gave up a wealthy and comfortable life, came to sleep in muddy ground and eat coarse food, and worked hard to build a new China, and felt infinitely excited.</p>

<h3>Economic Resources of the Southwest</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>1. The total tonnage of coal buried in the southwest provinces reaches 1,153,500,000 tons.</p>
<p>2. The annual salt production totals 100,000,000 piculs.</p>
<p>3. The manganese ore in China accounts for 90% in the southwest provinces.</p>
<p>4. China's annual production of 125,000 taels of gold, and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Sichuan and Xikang, are the center of gold sand production.</p>
<p>5. The lead smelting plant in Hunan produces 2,000 tons and can obtain 120,000 taels of silver.</p>
<p>6. Yunnan, April, Guizhou is China's only copper-producing area, with an annual output of 480 tons.</p>
<p>7. Hunan, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces all have lead and zinc mines, with a production of 6,600 tons of lead and 13,000 tons of zinc.</p>
<p>8. China produces tungsten, with a total output of 950,000 tons, and the southwest accounts for one-third of it.</p>
<p>9. Yunnan has the most tin production, followed by Guangxi and Hunan, with a total of 7,400 tons.</p>
<p>10. Antimony production is almost exclusively occupied by China. Of the 20,000 tons of global production, China accounts for 12,000 tons, or 60%. And 99% of China's antimony production is in Hunan.</p>

<h3>Cooperative Undertakings in Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>"The gibbons' cries on both banks could not be stopped, as the light boat has sped past ten thousand mountains." In the past, at the mention of Sichuan, the dangers of the Three Gorges and the difficulty of the Shu Road would spring to mind. Now, all enterprises have moved with the war, the transportation in the southwest has gradually developed, natural obstacles have been overcome by human efforts, and the hidden resources have been exploited by machinery. I am like the rising sun, and people are like sinking in the mud, but the degree is in direct proportion. Therefore, if I want to describe the prosperity of the southwest in detail, it can be said that "there are too many bamboo slips to write on." Here, I will briefly discuss the cooperative undertakings in Sichuan to get a glimpse of the whole picture.</p>
<p>The total number of cooperative organizations in China, including the occupied areas, is more than 110,000, of which 99% are economic and credit cooperatives. Taking the loans of the China Farmers Bank alone, there are already 31,530,000 yuan, which has greatly benefited farmers. At the end of May this year, the government established a Central Cooperative Undertakings Management Office, and there is now a meticulous plan for the implementation methods. In the past, cooperation focused on agricultural credit loans. In the future, the Management Office will pay attention to cooperative undertakings such as consumption, production, transportation, and distribution.</p>
<p>In Sichuan, there was a bumper harvest of rice this year. Chairman Chiang has ordered the allocation of 15,416,000 yuan to purchase rice, which is directly purchased from farmers by various cooperative banks and cooperatives. Because in Sichuan, there are 18,293 cooperatives in 120 villages, and more than 60 villages have established cooperative banks with a total capital of 10,000,000 yuan. Farmers' credit loans and mortgage loans have reached 1,501,341 yuan. Sichuan also had a bumper harvest last year. Fearing that "cheap grain would hurt farmers," 1,312 cooperatives invested 852,872 yuan to purchase rice, and later lent 503,373 yuan to 223,155 farmers for the purchase of seeds for agricultural crops.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Central Cooperative Undertakings Management Office held a training institute, dividing all personnel in the cooperative into groups of 20 to receive training for two months. The advanced courses were taught by personnel from the Central Political School near Chongqing.</p>
<p>Other cooperation undertakings in Xiang, Gui, Dian, Qian, and Kang have also been thriving since the Anti-Japanese War. Originally, the six southwest provinces had extremely rich reserves. Before the war, Southwest Construction Company and other companies were established. On New Year's Day this year, the National Government established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee, and the cooperative is also under the jurisdiction of the committee. For example, the coal, iron, and kerosene in Sichuan, Kang, Dian, and Gui, and the copper and tin in Yunnan, and the lead and zinc in Hunan are all sources of wealth. In the past, some people thought that the place where finance gathered was the coastal provinces, but now it has gradually moved westward, which shows that China has a vast land and abundant resources and a large population. The Japanese, who want to fight a quick battle and are ignorant of spatial factors, now know that China is: "When the water runs out and you doubt there is no road, willows are dark, flowers are bright, and another village appears." (Chrysanthemum)</p>
<h3>Underground Deposits in Sichuan - Coal and Kerosene</h3>
<p>Sichuan, the "Land of Abundance," is truly blessed by nature. Not only is its production rich, with rice, grain, wood, tung oil, mulberry, hemp, tobacco, and other edible products all available, but its underground deposits are also extremely abundant, unmatched by other provinces. In terms of the distribution of deposits, Song, Pan, and Mianning are rich in gold; Tianquan and Lushan are rich in silver; Huili, Yanyuan, and Pengxian are rich in copper; Nanchuan and Qijiang are rich in mercury, iron, and coal. Among them, the reserves of coal are particularly abundant, from Fengjie in the east to Guanghanyuan in the west, from Luxian in the south to Guangyuan in the north, there is the famous Bashu coalfield. The distribution of kerosene can be divided into three areas: (1) The Zigong area of ​​Fushun County. (2) The Jiading Leshan, Jianwei Rongxian area. (3) The area near the Jialing River, including Anyue Suining, Shejiang Yanting, Pengxi, and Nanchong.</p>
<p>After the National Government worked hard to develop the resources in the southwest, it has built large-scale oil refineries in Sichuan, and surveyed mining areas for mining and refining. The oil mining areas that have been surveyed are as follows: (1) Weiquanjing Oil Mine. The chemical test results show that the oil is transparent, smokeless, has a strong ignition point, and is rich in content, which can meet the needs of the entire Sichuan. (2) Zigongjing Oil Mine. The chemical test results show that it is smokeless and pure, and can be used for 20 years. (3) The oil mine in Xixiang, Pengxi, has an area of ​​more than 80 mu and a reserve of more than 6,000 tons. (4) Shenghuaxi Stone Oil Mine, which is deep green, covers an area of ​​more than ten mu, has an ignition speed of 106, and is odorless. (5) Longzhuxi Oil Mine in Daxian is black, has an ignition speed of 109, has very few impurities, and has an area of ​​more than 30 mu. (6) Baxian Oil Mine, which is black, has an ignition speed of 102, is smokeless and odorless, and has an area of ​​more than 40 mu.</p>
<p>If the many coalfields and oil mining areas mentioned above are changed from traditional methods to scientific methods, then the mining volume will definitely increase greatly, which can greatly increase our strength in the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<h3>Sichuan's Traditional Coal Mining Methods</h3>
<h3>The Miao People in the Anti-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Due to the Anti-Japanese War, the ethnic minorities in the southwest, such as the Miao and Yao people, have had more opportunities to contact the Han people, reducing many misunderstandings, and they have also undertaken many tasks in the Anti-Japanese War. Originally, their numbers were not small. For example, there are more than 30,000 Miao people in Guangxi Province alone, and there are many in other provinces such as Gui and Qian. In Guizhou, many Miao people serve as Baojia chiefs. In Nanning, Guangxi, there was an early Special Education Committee that established a special teacher training institute to educate the Miao minority. The students of the school have now participated in anti-Japanese propaganda and even want to participate in guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>The Miao people live by the mountains, and there are no windows in their houses. Men and women live together in the same room. In summer, they bathe in the river together. In terms of clothing, men wear short clothes and are barefoot, wearing blue shirts and trousers; women wear longer clothes, with floral cloth as skirts and no underwear. However, both men and women wrap their heads with cloth, regardless of winter or summer, which is a bit like Indian Ah San. As for food, it is also very simple. In addition to sowing five grains, fish and salt are considered delicacies from the mountains and seas.</p>
<p>Their original education only used horses, cattle, and rats to record the year, and knotted ropes to record events. This is an ancient custom, so it is said that they are descendants of Gao Xinshi.</p>
<p>The Miao people are extremely upright, brave and fierce, and they will avenge even the smallest grievance for generations, so there is a saying in Hunan that "the hatred of the Miao mother will never end." However, they are extremely superstitious. When people are sick, telling the temple and swearing to the gods is the only method. Now, if they can be patiently persuaded and properly trained, it is possible to call them to wield spears and kill enemies, and they will have the courage of Meng Ben and Xia Yu.</p>
<h3>The Miao People in Qian and Xiang</h3>
<h3>Miasma in the Southwest</h3>
<p>The Originally Mysterious Miasma Is Just Another Name for Malignant Malaria</p>
<p>The climate in the southwest is subtropical. The climate is quite hot throughout the year, and the humidity is higher than in other parts of the country. Coupled with natural conditions such as lush vegetation, it is very easy for malaria mosquitoes to breed. As a result, malignant malaria, or Tropical Malaria, is very likely to occur in these areas. In the past, Chinese people did not understand this reason, so absurd and unfounded claims arose, saying that there was so-called miasma in the southwest, and people who were poisoned by this miasma would die. This unfounded claim not only spread among the population but was also recorded in ancient books. However, after modern medical scientists studied it, the mystery of this ancient "miasma" was proven to be malignant malaria, which is very prevalent in the tropics. This was scientifically proven five years ago by Yao Yongzheng, director of the Department of Parasitology of the National Economic Commission's Health Experiment Office and section chief of the Health Administration, Liu Jingbang, director of the Military Medical School, and Lin Liangcheng, a technician at the Health Experiment Office, who studied the Nanpankou area, where the miasma was the most severe at the junction of Qian and Gui. Since we know that miasma is malignant malaria, the way to treat malaria is naturally no more than quinine, the special medicine for treating malaria. Currently, because there is a great need for quinine in the southwest, and because of the inconvenience of transportation and foreign exchange, the prices of all Western medicines in the interior are very high. For the sake of the people's health, the Southwest Headquarters has planted quinine trees on a large scale in Yunnan and other places. In the future, after this pharmaceutical raw material can meet the needs, that terrible malignant malaria may not be so terrible.</p>
<h3>Map Explanation</h3>
<p>— Sun Jingqiu</p>
<p>(1) Highway Transportation</p>
<p>The hub of highway transportation in the Southwest is Guiyang, the provincial capital, branching out in four directions: east, south, west, and north.</p>
<p>(1) East Route: (Guiyang to Changsha) The entire route is 1009 kilometers. It takes five days by bus, costing $70.63. Midday meal stops include Machangping, Zhenyuan, Huaihua, and Changde. Overnight stops are Huangping, Huangxian, and Yuanling. Due to recent fighting in northern Hunan, through tickets are unavailable; tickets must be purchased in segments.</p>
<p>(2) South Route: (Guiyang to Liuzhou) The entire route is 632 kilometers. It takes three days by bus, costing $44.24. Departing from Guiyang, the first day includes a midday meal at Machangping and an overnight stay at Dushan. The second day includes a midday meal at Nandan and an overnight stay at Hechi. On the third day, one can reach Liuzhou after a midday meal at Yishan.</p>
<p>(3) West Route: (Guiyang to Kunming) The entire route is 662 kilometers. The journey takes three days, costing $46.34 in national currency. Midday meal stops include Qujing, Panxian, and Anshun. Overnight stops are Pingyi and Annan.</p>
<p>(4) North Route: (Guiyang to Chongqing) The entire route is 488 kilometers. It takes two and a half days by bus, costing $34.16 in national currency. The first day includes a midday meal at Wujiangdu and an overnight stay at Tongzi. The second day includes a midday meal at Songkan and an overnight stay at Qijiang. One can reach Haitangxi station in the afternoon of the third day, and Chongqing is accessible by crossing the river.</p>
<p>In addition to the above four routes, there are also the Sichuan-Hunan Highway, the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway, and highways in various other provinces. The Sichuan-Hunan Highway runs from Chongqing through Qijiang, Nanchuan, Qianjiang, Xiushan, Yuanling, and Changde to Changsha. Recently, this route only extends to Yuanling, known as the Yu-Yuan section of the Southwest Highway. Buses operate in segments, dividing the route into Chongqing-Nanchuan, Nanchuan-Huojiang-Qianjiang-Xiushan, and Xiushan-Chadong sections, with one bus running daily in each section. The journey takes four and a half days. The above sections are all referred to as the Sichuan section. Chadong to Sanjiaoping and then to Yuanling, these two sections are known as the Hunan section, with daily bus service and a journey of one and a half days. The total travel cost is over $60.</p>
<p>The Sichuan-Yunnan Highway starts from Kunming, passing through Qujing and Yiwei in Yunnan Province; Weining, Banzhang, and Bijie in Guizhou Province; Chishui River; and Xuyong in Sichuan Province to reach Luzhou. The entire route is 912.70 kilometers long. Crossing the Tuojiang River from Luzhou, a highway leads to Longchang in southern Sichuan, connecting with the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway. This section is 62 kilometers long and is also part of the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway. The entire journey can be divided into five days: The first day is from Kunming to Yiwei (158 kilometers), the second day is from Yiwei to Weining (178 kilometers), the third day is from Weining to Bijie (175 kilometers), the fourth day is from Bijie to Xuyong (184 kilometers), and the fifth day is from Xuyong to Luzhou (118 kilometers). The travel cost is over $60.</p>
<p>(2) Railway Transportation</p>
<p>Most railways between provinces in the Southwest are under construction. The Xiang-Gui Railway, which runs from Hengyang in Hunan Province through Guilin to Liuzhou, is already open to traffic. Although the Guilin-Liuzhou section has been completed, it has not yet officially opened. On the Hengyang-Guilin section (360 kilometers), there are daily express, ordinary express, and local trains for convenient passenger travel. The fastest journey takes only over ten hours. Ticket prices are $5.25 for third class, $10.50 for second class, and $15.75 for first class. According to recent news, the terminal stations of the Yue-Han Railway have been changed to Lukou (only one station away from Zhuzhou) and Qujiang, with normal traffic in between.</p>
<p>The Xiang-Qian Railway starts from Zhuzhou and recently has been opened to traffic up to Shatangwan in Lantian (only 697 kilometers from Zhuzhou). The remaining section is currently under construction. Other railways, such as the Chuan-Dian, Dian-Mian, and Cheng-Yu railways, are also under construction, and their completion is expected soon.</p>
<p>(3) Air Transportation</p>
<p>Air transportation between the provinces in the Southwest and both domestic and foreign locations is particularly frequent, mostly handled by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Eurasia Aviation Corporation. The routes are as follows:</p>
<p>Chongqing-Guilin Route: One round trip per week, costing $300 in national currency.</p>
<p>Kunming-Chongqing Route: Daily flights, costing $325 in national currency.</p>
<p>Kunming-Hanoi Route: One or two round trips per week, costing 140 Vietnamese Dong or $225 in national currency.</p>
<p>Chongqing-Hanoi Route: One or two round trips per week, costing $550 in national currency or 300 Vietnamese Dong.</p>
<p>Chongqing-Hong Kong Route: Three or four round trips per week, costing $600 in national currency or 400 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>Chongqing-Guiyang Route: Three round trips per week, costing $155 in national currency.</p>
<p>In addition to the above routes, there are also the Kunming-Chongqing to Chengdu-Xi'an route and the Northwest Air Route. Recently, CNAC has also opened a new route from Chongqing to Yangon in Burma. French airlines and British Imperial Airways also have flights departing from Hong Kong to Hanoi, the capital of Annam. Therefore, in terms of air transportation, the six provinces of the Southwest maintain constant contact with the rest of the world.</p>

<h3>Little Friends! Learn from the Premier!</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of Premier Sun's birth. Little friends, you are all solemnly commemorating him!</p>
<p>Little friends! To commemorate the Premier, we should learn from the Premier!</p>
<p>Our Premier was very intelligent and diligent. But he did not want to be a bookworm who only recited books. So when he was in the village school, he asked the teacher to explain the meaning of the books, rather than just teaching him to recite them. Little friends! Our Premier was a child who loved to learn and ask questions. When he did not understand something, he would ask the teacher until he thoroughly understood it, which made him happy. I hope you will learn this method of studying by asking questions!</p>
<p>The Premier not only loved to learn and ask questions but also had scientific thinking. He felt that superstition was the enemy of science, so he broke into a temple and broke off the wooden hand of the idol. Little friends! We should learn from the Premier, eliminate superstitious ideas, and use careful observation and experimentation to explore true and accurate knowledge!</p>
<h3>Merits of Children in Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Children are the masters of the future country and, further, the masters of the future of mankind and the creators of the future world. Therefore, the status of children in various countries around the world is generally highly respected. Only in China, where children's education is backward and children's organizations are lacking, does everything show that children have not yet been valued by people; recently, this has changed greatly.</p>
<p>Only a very small number of Chinese children are able to possess both virtue, intelligence, and physical fitness. Below, let the author talk about the merits of children in various countries around the world for you to use as a reference.</p>
<p>1. Soviet children are hardworking and love cleanliness. In school, they mostly work and study at the same time. During holidays, they often go to factories for internships or form teams to pick up scraps of paper on the streets. As long as they are capable, they will do anything, no matter how big or small.</p>
<p>2. British children are persistent, conservative, and honest. In every action, they often ask themselves if there is any mistake and are very obedient to their elders. They will never give up on a task until they are completely hopeless.</p>
<p>3. German children are brave, have a research mind, and admire sports. In German elementary schools, during recess, you will not see a single student sitting idly without energy. They are all spirited and active on the playground. During class, no one fails to listen attentively. They will disassemble everything, from toys to small objects, to study how they are made.</p>
<p>4. Japanese children are hardworking and obedient. The hardship of Japanese children's lives cannot be compared to that of children in other countries. Most elementary school students bring lunch to school, usually just some cold rice and a few salted radishes. After school, they help their parents with various household chores.</p>
<p>5. American children are lively, generous, and able to unite. On the streets, you often see that when a child is bullied, his companions will stand up for him.</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you have these merits? If not, hurry up and start cultivating them from today. I hope that in the future, you may be even better than them!</p>
<h3>Moon in the Pond</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yilin</p>
<p>—English Fable—</p>
<p>Once, a merchant went on a trip and came to a village. Outside the village, there was a pond. Around the pond were a group of people, who were putting rakes, brooms, and straw into the pond and frantically scooping around. The traveler asked them what they were doing. They said, "What are we doing? It's a big deal! The moon has fallen into the pond, and we can't get it out." Hearing this, the merchant couldn't help but burst out laughing and told them to look at the moon in the sky. He also said, "The moon in the water is just its reflection!" But they didn't believe him and instead scolded him severely.</p>
<p>So, don't reason with foolish people.</p>
<h3>How to Make Leaf Vein Bookmarks</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Little friends, you have many new books, but there is still one thing you can't lack. I wonder if you have forgotten to prepare it, which is the bookmark we are talking about now. If you haven't bought one yet, you can make a few yourself. After making them, they are economical and beautiful, and the method is very simple. Little friends, you may want to try it.</p>
<p>Before making it, please first collect some of your favorite leaf specimens and put them in a ventilated place to dry. Then go to the pharmacy to buy some caustic soda (commonly known as soda lye, the price is very cheap), dissolve it in boiling water, and then put the leaves and the caustic soda solution together in an earthenware pot. Heat it slowly over a fire to gradually corrode the flesh of the leaves. After about a quarter of an hour, a paste-like substance will appear on the leaves. You can take them out and rinse them with water. At this time, the main veins, side veins, etc. on the leaves will be clearly visible. Finally, apply your favorite color to the veins. After it dries, iron it with an iron, and tie a colored ribbon to it, and you will have an economical and beautiful leaf vein bookmark.</p>
<h3>New Year —Ming'er's Refuge Diary, Part Forty-Two—</h3>
<p>— Rizheng</p>
<p>The only holiday in the minds of the villagers—the abolished lunar New Year—finally arrived about a month after the national New Year. They had craned their necks and waited for it for a whole year.</p>
<p>In the last few days of the year, every corner of the village, rich or poor, big or small, was filled with a busy atmosphere. On the stone road leading to the city, donkeys with heavy loads on their backs were drooping their heads, panting heavily, and seeming to show that they could not bear the burden. They were constantly coming and going, and the string of bells in front of their necks made a jingle sound as their hooves moved, as if they were complaining for the donkeys, especially in the quiet air, it was particularly desolate. By the rapid, the waterwheel of the mill was rushed by the water so that it could not breathe, and it was struggling with a squeak. The mill owner urged it to speed up its work so that it could rest for the New Year, so it worked hard to turn the axle. The sound of pounding hammers was constantly echoing in the surrounding air, showing that the work was even more tense. The number of fishermen by the stream also suddenly increased. Everyone hoped to catch one or two big fish as a delicious New Year's dish (because although there was money in the village, fresh live fish could not be bought, so they could only go fishing themselves.) They patiently waited for the big fish to bite. The villagers were very happy to prepare for the New Year, but the domesticated livestock—pigs, chickens, ducks…—suffered a massacre. If they knew that the New Year was coming soon, I don't know how painful it would be in their hearts!</p>
<p>Everyone in the village—big, small, male, female, old, young—was full of happy expressions, but Ming'er's family was silent, still cold and peaceful as usual. Everyone's expression was exactly the opposite of the villagers'. They could only taste the joy of celebrating the New Year at home in the past from sweet memories; now that they were refugees in another country, they could only watch other people celebrate the New Year.</p>
<p>Steamed cakes, sending off the stove god, thanking the year… scenes that embellished the New Year were playing before Ming'er's eyes. The customs of this mountain village, thousands of miles away from Ming'er's hometown, were after all somewhat different, which aroused Ming'er's interest.</p>
<p>This was the last night of the year, and the village was unusually lively, with bright lights and candles. The villagers stopped their usual work and engaged in new pastimes. But the god of sleep was lingering around Ming'er, making his eyelids heavier and preventing them from separating, and Ming'er could not resist it, so he climbed onto the bed dejectedly. In the beautiful land of dreams, he happily spent the last night in his hometown.</p>
<p>After a burst of thunderous firecrackers, the New Year came. At that moment in the morning, the village was so quiet that there was not a single sound. Everyone was dreaming New Year's dreams. At about nine or ten o'clock, the ancestral hall, which had been decorated with a new look, was opened, and men in new clothes, everything was new, walked towards the ancestral hall. When they met each other, they inevitably said "Congratulations." After a while, they held a group worship ceremony in the ancestral hall, very piously greeting their ancestors for the New Year, and hoping to bless them with peace and a good harvest this year, and also congratulating each other. This lasted for about an hour before they returned to their homes, no longer going out, because it was not appropriate to visit relatives and friends on the first day of the New Year. So the sound of dice and dominoes replaced the sound of work on weekdays.</p>
<p>Ming'er sat in the house, thinking to himself, "Next year today, I can finally happily celebrate the New Year in my hometown."</p>
<h3>Cunning and Brute Force</h3>
<p>— Jing Yu Zuo</p>
<h3>The Blue Dwarfs (8)</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>Ali said with surprise, "Huh, strange, strange, how could these pine cones fall down for no reason?" At this moment, she suddenly heard a sound all around, which forced her to look up again. She saw a number of exquisite and small dwarfs pouring down from those branches. For a moment, she was dazzled, as if a large number of dwarfs, one after another, were pouring onto the ground; after a while, when she calmed down, she saw that there were not many people. Immediately, she quickly counted the number of people, one, two, three, all the way to twelve, thirteen, fourteen, a total of twenty-four. She carefully looked at them and said to herself, "Every two of them form a group, a full two dozen blue dwarfs."</p>
<p>That was exactly right, they were the blue dwarfs! After they poured onto the ground, they lined up in pairs, two crouching on the ground walking, two walking on a wooden bucket they brought, two starting to do somersaults, two kneeling on the ground, turning their heads and making funny faces; in this way, every two formed a group, each doing different movements, making the moss-covered ground in front of Ali their playground. They were wearing the same blue clothes, just like the blue dwarfs in the porcelain factory.</p>
<p>Ali sat quietly, watching them. She did not feel any strange feeling in her heart, but was thinking, "They are much bigger than the blue dwarfs in the porcelain factory; can they be bigger than my thumb? How can you say they are bigger? They are actually many times larger. If they stand up, they are as long as my arm. I guess they will climb onto my knees in a while, and I can measure them. I don't have to talk to them now, I'll wait for them to speak first."</p>
<p>Sure enough, after a while, two of the blue dwarfs left their companions and walked towards Ali. But as soon as they reached her feet, they suddenly jumped up, flipped over, and stood on the ground with their heads. Ali remembered that her aunt seemed to have told her that they could stand upside down on the ground with their heads, maybe they wanted me to do the same. So she muttered to herself, "Huh, how could Auntie know about them so clearly? They really don't use their feet to touch the ground, but use their heads instead. But I hope they don't ask me to do what they do, I can't stand it."</p>
<p>While Ali was thinking this, she saw the dwarfs jump again, flip over, and put their two feet straight on the ground. They were all very polite, waving their hands and bowing for a while, and then started talking. The first one to walk over said, "We were afraid that the pine cones would fall down and hurt you!"</p>
<p>Ali didn't know how to answer him. After a while, she stuttered, "I—I don't know—sorry, gentlemen, I—I don't know what to call you." The dwarfs' mouths moved, but they didn't make a sound. Ali thought they might be about to say their names, but they didn't say anything, just stared at her blankly.</p>

<h3>Recent Trends in Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European war, which caused great depression to people all over the world, Hollywood film companies are recently preparing to produce a large number of slapstick comedies.</p>
<p>From the company's perspective, the cost of producing slapstick comedies is cheaper than other types such as historical films and war films. From the audience's perspective, they can get a kind of mental adjustment. It can be said to kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>During the last war, the film industry was not greatly affected, but its status was raised instead. At the same time, the status of slapstick clowns was also valued by people who were depressed at that time. Charlie Chaplin's fame was due to his starring in the slapstick comedy "Shoulder Arms" at that time.</p>
<p>Based on past experience, Hollywood film companies now have great confidence in producing slapstick comedies. What is regrettable is that there is a lack of producers of such films. There were two who were very famous in the past, one called Mabel Normand and the other called Keystore Kerps, but unfortunately they have both passed away.</p>
<p>"The Flying Deuces," the first film after Laurel and Hardy reunited, is a typical example of this type. It is said that Charlie Chaplin is also planning to make one recently, but the title has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>As for war films and films related to publicizing military affairs, the companies are still not giving up. Warner Bros. has completed one first, titled "Nurse Edith Cavell," starring Anna Neagle. However, if the European war cannot end by the end of the year, more than 50% of Hollywood's output will be lighthearted and joyful slapstick comedies.</p>
<h3>Garbo's First Comedy Role</h3>
<p>— Jing Yuan</p>
<p>Hollywood Swedish star Garbo has been on the screen for a long time, but none of the films she has starred in in the past have been tragedies. Now she has changed her style and exceptionally collaborated with Melvyn Douglas on a very lighthearted comedy "Ninotscha," directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Garbo plays a Russian daredevil female soldier. In one scene in the film, she personally bakes many sweets. When this scene was finished filming, the staff on the set scrambled to eat the food made by this mysterious woman. Even Ernst Lubitsch tasted two of them. Everyone praised Garbo's superb cooking skills. In addition, it is said that she also has many dance scenes in the film!</p>
<h3>Zhang Eyun and Mu Tiefen</h3>
<p>— Ke Yun Lou Zhu</p>
<p>Among the female actors who have become famous in recent times for their training, Wang Yuhua, Zhang Eyun, and Hou Yulan are the most pure. Eyun has received the assistance of Mu Tiefen, and her improvement in the Cheng school singing style is indeed significant. Tiefen assisted Yu Shuang for more than ten years, following her day and night. He has a thorough understanding of the essence of the singing style. His instruction to Eyun is direct, unlike those who imitate privately. Moreover, her natural voice is clear, gentle, and smooth, suitable for both high and low pitches. Her singing is pleasing and eliminates worldly concerns. Her use of the singing style is consistent from beginning to end, and there is no sign of exhaustion in her high and low transitions. She does not pursue artificiality and presents herself with a dignified naturalness, which seems to surpass Yuhua and Yulan. Recently, listening to her "Shilin Sacrifices the Pagoda," especially the "Erhuang Fan Tiao" and other excerpts, she emphasizes the use of low notes in her singing, like a delicate thread that never breaks. Her pauses and intonations are quite similar to Yu Shuang's recent style, but she lacks her breadth and generosity.</p>
<p>Tiefen's musical talent was well-known when he assisted Yu Shuang. His accompaniment is extremely precise, interlocking seamlessly. His fingerwork is excellent, and after the elder Yan Heng, there is no second person to compare. Every performance is characterized by its perfect balance of tempo and mood. The peak of his musical performance was in the "Green Jade Hairpin" and "Wenji Returns to Han" and other films recorded by Gao Shi. At that time, Yu Shuang's key was still high, and the sound of the zither was clear and resonant. I would listen to them dozens of times when I had time, without feeling tired. His moving performance on the zither was like this. Therefore, Eyun's abandonment of Mei and adoption of Cheng, establishing a foundation in the singing style, and achieving success, is due to Tiefen's contribution, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Minhua Auditions for "Confucius"</h3>
<p>Recently established Minhua Film Company has decided that after director Fei Mu directs "Confucius" and Zhang Yi plays Zilu—the role of "Confucius" has not yet been decided due to strict selection. Fei Jun has now drafted a list of candidates and is considering the conditions of each person. The final method will be to hold an evaluation to decide. It will start soon. At that time, the unknown heroes who are listed will simultaneously dress up and try out different performances to determine who is "Confucius." After the decision is made, the film industry will have a new look.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden - A Battle Drama Praising National Heroes</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>As for the most outstanding external feudal lords in battle achievements and the most tragic in martyrdom, the most magnificent should be the Ningwu Pass guard Zhou Yuji. "According to Yuji, he was a Jinzhou artist from the Ming Dynasty. He had male strength since he was young, was good at shooting. During the Chongzhen period, he fought against the Qing soldiers and defeated the roving bandits, all with merit. He rose to the position of General of Shanxi. Li Zicheng captured Taiyuan, and Yuji firmly defended Daizhou, killing countless bandits. When his strength was exhausted and the city fell, he died. He was posthumously awarded the title of Grand Protector. His posthumous name was Zhongwu." The above is Zhou's biography. The playwright, based on the fact that the Gu family was martyred, wrote the drama "Ningwu Pass," which is divided into the chapters: Confrontation, Foot Battle, Climbing the City, Kneeling and Begging, Farewell to Mother, and Chaotic Arrows. In addition to the protagonist Zhou Yuji, others such as Zhou's mother (old female role), Zhou's wife (female role), old family general (clown), One-Eyed Tiger (painted face), Li Chuang Wang (painted face), and Li Hongji (young male role) all play important roles in the play. Moreover, the play is a performance of a heroic story. All those who play the characters in the play must not only be able to sing, but also be able to act. As for the martial arts, steps, spear and sword skills of Yuji and One-Eyed Tiger, they must be proficient in order to make the whole play shine. The confrontations and foot battles focus on the performance of the male lead's armor and martial skills. When the performance reaches the fall of Daizhou, Yuji plans to return to Ningwu, bid farewell to his old mother, and then fight the bandits to the death, dedicating himself to the country. The plot gradually becomes tense at this point, and the most moving scenes are Farewell to Mother and Chaotic Arrows. Yuji, after the defeat, with a face full of dust and unkempt armor, only thinks of his aging mother. If she sees his face and hears the news of the loss of territory and his defeat, it will surely make his white-haired old mother frightened and anxious. Therefore, Zhou deliberately acts calm and carefree when entering the mansion to see his mother. However, after stepping into the central hall, he suddenly sees red candles burning high, his mother, wife, and son sitting together at a table, drinking and toasting, and the family is happily reunited, only lacking his seat.
