<p>巴黎　法政府昨晚宣稱、已獲得大宗文件、可證明蘇德間有軍事聯盟之密的、若於此時接受蘇已明白表示、若不恢複波蘭原狀、和平決不可能、法國必須繼續作戰、直至希特勒主義完全消滅爲止、蘇俄給予德國之援助、若供給油麥等物、雖使英法於作戰上感到困難、但對英法作戰之決心、則毫無影響、且蘇聯海陸運輸工具之缺乏、亦恐不能對德充分供給、同時英國對德之封鎖、將加緊執行、法總理達拉第與法軍司令甘茂林昨於外部官邸對蘇德在莫斯科發表之和平建議、加以研究、外務次長萊吉在旁襄助、甘茂林將軍對最後勝利之信念、至今毫不變更達拉第昨與張伯倫之電話商談中、已證明英法態度之一致、英法官方一致吾認希特勒之和平建議爲建設東歐和平之基礎、法國並非不注意蘇德之外交及經濟上之互助、同時並信蘇德或已訂有軍事同盟條的、截止昨晚、法政府尙未接到蘇德正式和平建議、雖對其內容早已獲悉、蘇德或因英法已於事先表示拒絕、或即不擬提出、亦未可知、（三十日美聯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　此間各觀察家頃談稱、外交人民委員長莫洛托夫咋與德外長里賓特羅市所簽訂之友好與劉界條約、業將波蘭領土實行瓜分、並在兩國之間樹立經常的聯繫、則以雙方對於禁絕波蘭民族之光復運動、利害從同故也、至雙方簽訂經濟協定之目標、乃在實行經濟合作、俾在今後數年中、調整雙方生產、質言之、即由德國以製造品換取蘇聯各種原料品、俾雙方貿易關係、恢復一九三一年間兩國貿易之最高額、（按是年德蘇兩國貿易總額共達十一萬萬馬克）、此在外交界人士則謂、德蘇兩國友好與劃界條的、雖非軍事同盟條的、實爲軍事盟的張本、蓋以此項條的規定、第三國首欲干涉波蘭問題之解決、德蘇兩國斷難加以容忍、英法兩國旣始終承認波蘭爲其同盟國、則德蘇兩國條約所云、不當以威脅加諸英法兩國、不寗唯是、德蘇兩國聯合宣言有云、「德蘇兩國政府即當通力合作、設法結束德國與英法兩國之戰爭、此項努力若果失敗、則延長戰事之責任、應由英法兩國負之、屆時德蘇兩國即當互相諮詢、決定必要措置」、此其所言、自屬又一威脅、且宣言中又云、德蘇兩國常於必要時、覓致其他友邦相與合作、以期儘速達到目的、關於此層、各外國觀察家咸謂、蘇聯殆已明瞭英法兩國決難與德國成立妥協、今後是吾將在現行戰爭中、切實支持德國、殊可注意矣云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　德蘇協定中雖有如英法拒絕德國和議、則德蘇互商必要計畫之規定、意在威脅、然此間觀察家大都認德蘇間並無軍事盟的、並以爲德外長里賓特羅甫之使命、因德蘇軍事盟的之未存在而歸於失敗、蓋英法如對於德蘇兩獨裁者希特勒與史丹林之和平建議拒不接受、則德國幾將完全孤立也、據極有資格之觀察家意見、蘇愛條的之目的、在防範將來德國之攻擊而非在完全支配愛沙尼亞國也、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　德蘇兩國締結邊界友善協定之後、德國政界人士咸認爲此乃東歐洲最後之改組、並於此申明德國之態度、宜稱、英法兩國作戰之目的、爲援助波蘭、今波蘭旣已不復存在、德蘇兩國則表示維護東歐改組之決心、德國再三巾明、對於英國或法國均無作戰之目的、是則英法兩國似無再繼續作戰之理由云、（三十日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　此間國社黨當局、獲悉聯盟國將輕率的拒絕蘇德聯合和平運動建議之初次反應後、今日勸吿英法兩國在拒絕和平建議前、「再思」而後行、權威方面聲稱、蘇德聯合宣言、係對和平之最後建議、此外不致再發正式公文、同時彼等表示莫斯科公的之主要點、爲第三國對波蘭將來問題發言之權、且不能爲和平會議所限制、（三十日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間人士現仍詳細研究德蘇協定對於德國究竟有何種實際上之援助、查蘇聯貿易統計所載、自一九三一年至去歲之間、蘇聯輸出至德之貨物、已由三千萬鎊降至四百萬鎊、德國對蘇聯之輸出亦由四千七百萬鎊滅至二百萬鎊、去年蘇聯因國內需要增加、致所產之塊鐵銅鉛鋁鋅錫碟镍等、尙不敷應用、自無餘額可供輸出、蘇聯之巨大資源、固不難在德國專家指導之下、從事發展、惟在數個月之短促時期中、亦決難辦到、軍事批評家咸料蘇聯軍隊、不致出現於西綫、惟或將以坦克車及飛機等假予德國、則屬可能、若干批評家更謂史丹林既旣不戰而獲得一切、目下又何必參加戰事乎、海軍批評家則謂蘇聯與愛沙尼亞之協定、允許蘇聯在愛沙尼亞各島設立海空軍根據地、德國對此消息、定感不快、因在此種情形之下、蘇聯已可控制里加海灣、而稱雄於波羅的海云、（三十日路透社電）</p>

<p>阿姆斯特丹、倫敦報吿稱、土耳其軍事代表團首途赴芙、私人由土京發來之電訊、證實此事、官方尙未證實、但消息靈通之人士咸信此事之眞確、聞該代表團之使命、係根據行將簽訂之土英法三國互助協的、商議軍火供給之辦法、（三十日海通電）</p>

<h3 id="c12">美国所期待的 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>近幾天來，國際變化，錯綜紛紜，加以國際間的陰謀家，爲遂其本國的目的，復從中推波助瀾，佈爲種種烟慕；宣傳界摭拾了一鱗半爪，演爲神經過敏的推論。例如謠傳蘇聯重新活躍於歐洲政治舞臺。故已與日本獲得相互的諒解，而允日本在遠東採取自由行動，更因日本大使東鄉茂德，恰於日內晤蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，國外觀察家更從而推測日蘇兩國有不利中國抗戰之意。於是關心遠東大局的人們，不免多方揣測，深滋疑慮。其實兩年來的戰爭，已經足以使日本知道，日本欲以武力屈服中國，已不可能。而中國的抗戰，並不依附任何國家，也是爲人所共知的事實。到了今日，即使若干同情中國的國家，它的國際政策在別一方面或有所更張，但到現在爲止，絕對沒有發見對華態度有何轉變。因此中國的外交政策，誠如外長王寵惠氏所說，完全根據於條的，允其是九國公約，貫澈維護中國領土完整，主權獨立爲目的；自始迄今，絕不動搖。更求之國際，則美國的政策最穩定，亦與中國外交政策最相契合。原來美國總統羅斯福氏執政以來。所昭示國際的，是美國外交政策的主要目的，在乎「竭其全力設法鏟除國際間的戰爭一；同時，努力於建設更偉大的海軍、以對付那些以戰爭爲工具的侵略者。二者互相呼應，而異其聲調；換言之，他所推行的大海軍計劃是很迅速的，而他對付侵略者的步驟，却是遲緩的。經過了過去的數年而到目前，美國對於侵略者的壓力，也有逐漸加緊之勢。他在去年年底，提了內容很堅實，而表面並不特殊的抗議；到了今年七月，却以迅雷不及掩耳手段，宣佈廢除美日商的。這種從容不迫的神情，必能使尙未瘋在的一部分日本人認識這是一個嚴重的警告。日本阿部內閣的起用野村，想調整對美關係，以便集中全力，解決所謂「中國問題」，其原因在此。日本方面纔感覺警告的嚴重性，還想用外交技術來虛與委蛇，而美國所以表示其穩定與堅實者，却又不限於外交上的機動。例如航空母艦朗格萊號及其他軍艦多艘，駛往菲列濱？轟炸機隊與偵察機隊由火奴魯魯經過米德威島與關島，飛往菲列濱二這是美國作戰飛機越過國際子午綫的第一决；更自珍珠港派一大型潛水艦隊往菲島，以增强美國亞細亞艦隊海上的防衛力量；允重要的、美國海軍部宣佈以夏威夷爲中心，舉行海軍大演習，將西方海岸的艦隊，大部也調往珍珠港；凡此舉動，雖美國官方吾認爲與歐戰或日本加緊侵華有關，然而誰說是沒有意義的盲動！他如美國陸軍部撥美金一千二百萬，在火奴魯魯開闢兩大飛機塲，及海軍部撥大宗款項的修築火奴魯魯及珍珠港的海港及空軍根據地，以及以前羅斯福於七月中宣佈建造大西洋及太平洋中工程堅固的空軍及潛艇根據地，以及撥款一千四百萬美金建造防衛巴拿馬空軍根據地；四千萬美金爲建造阿拉斯加空軍根據地，這一切大擴軍計畫，決不能視爲富豪的浪費，或失業的救濟吧！日本很明白這一層，所以她的新外相一上台，以與美國修好爲其基本政策，其原因也不外此。修好不難，重訂商的也不難；外相與使節更動與吾，甚至內閣改組與吾，皆不是什麼問題；祗要去年年底的牒文有誠實而公允的答復。這是美國唯一的期待。亦是美日之問的唯一關鍵！</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、初以外匯鬆動、略形虛弱、嗣後外匯由鬆回平、兼港帮買風陡健、反動猛漲、結果雖外匯軋平、而金價竟暴升八十元、是以外匯結價遂稍軋攏、計英金結價爲四千五百九十八元、美匯爲四千七百十元、昨日趨勢、晨開因外雁報鬆、即撳小至四千元、嗣後某金號與證券帮等時起賣風、曾二度退達三千九百九十元低盤旋以外匯忽轉軟化、故激動買風、某錢兌業及證券帮等爭先力吸、兼某銀樓亦反出爲進、不久再以香港帮亦來猛購、故飛躍上漲、一度竟昂達四千一百零五元高峯、惟午收爲四千一百元、午後因週六無市、但塲外初會回達四千零八十元、入後香港帮需求殷切、重復漲至四千一百元、半天交易尚旺、的一千四五百兩、銀樓飾金掛高十元、海關金等均呆定無變、</p>
<p>粭赤漲八十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因外匯松動、且某金號頗有賣意、致局勢帶疲、開市即做小二十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、爲叫千元、開後其金號塞予錢兌業十兩、爲三千九百九十元、時某錢兌業忽代客力吸百餘兩、且供方乘機扳價、遂抬高二十五元、某錢兌業進證劵帮及銀樓帮各一十兩、爲四千零十五元、此後某金號復起賣風、兼證劵帮亦來塞出、加之客帮暫懷觀望、故又不支下瀉、退入四千元關內、某余號售予銀樓帮十兩、爲三千九百九十元、旋因外匯回軟、另一證券帮頓起買風、且某錢兌業復代港帮等猛吸、加之售者頗缺、價遂飛躍直上、竟猛漲八十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、爲四千零七十元、此時人氣非常熱烈、詎料某金號及現金號乘高又來力塞、遂引起散戶賣風、而其時客帮亦納胃轉滯、不久回落三十元、錢兌業售予銀樓帮十兩、爲四千零四十元、將近午刻、因聞外匯續軟、加之港帮買意又萌、竟猛吸五百餘兩、市勢頓堅、竟又暴升六十五元、錢兌業進金號十兩、爲四千一百零五元、繼之證券帮賣予現金號二十兩、爲四千一百元作午收價、結果比上日回漲八十元、半天一百十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十元、收進的减小三十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛高十元</p>
<p>銀摟首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百零五元、迨至十時二十分掛高五元、正午又掛大五元、此後未見變動、結果計大同行改懸四百十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减低二十元光景、</p>
<p>現鈔供多　貼現回小五元</p>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、每千元初曾昂至九十元光景、後現鈔供過於求、頓見步低、至午刻在八十元左右、下午又低至七十七元半、結果跌落五元、錢業公會拆息早午兩市均開二角、</p>
<p>美銀跌勢尚緩　美印銀價疲弱</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無變動、英美匯暗市、晨開爲狀略帶軟化、英金計四辦士四二八七五、美匯爲七元四〇六二五、嗣因投機商復來斬結、九月份多頭、且外行如有利某行等亦賣意頗濃、致潛勢曾一度趨鬆、英金最硬銀行吃進價爲四辦士五六二五、美滙最賤銀行賣價爲七元五六二五、旋以洋行乘機陸續結進、兼華行亦來扒吸、並以其時投機商賣風已息、故市家頓復轉軟英金曾緊達叫辦士四〇六二五、美匯亦曾軟至七元三七五、惟午收以四辦士四三七五及七元四三七五收盤、較隔昨均無榮辱、聞收後情况重略帶軟、英金計四辦士四〇六二五、美匯爲七元四〇六二五、至十月份趨勢與現貨無異、半天交易尚旺、</p>
<p>鬆後逐步又回平</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均縮半辦士、紐約銀價跌二五、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·對滬·對法均平、美對英降六二五、對滬大五分、對法小二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士四二一八七五、美匯七元四〇六二五、較之前收、英微緊〇一五六二五、美略軟〇三一二五、開後因九月份一般無實力之多頭、傾向了結、且外行有利某行亦頻來塞出、雖洋行前來扒結、但爲數均屬零星、故趨勢轉鬆、計華商與有利某行賣予匯豐等外行及某洋行等現貨英金由四辦士四六八七五、硬至四辦士五三一二五、並現貨美滙由七元四三七五、長至五六二五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉跌二·七五、此後有利又售予洋行現貨美匯七元五六二五、時外行英金吃進價會還過四辦士五六二五、十時後因華商等賣風已息、加之華行前來吸收、故爲狀遂逐步回平、計華行扒進外行現貨英金四辦士四六八七五及四三七五並現貨美匯七元半及四三七五、將近午刻、英金最緊曾喊過四辦士四〇六二五、美匯亦呌進七元三七五、但不久即復回平、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士四三七五、美匯七元四三七五、十月份四辦士二八一二五、美匯七元一二五、結果比隔昨英美滙現期俱無榮辱、聞收後情形略軟、賣價英金計四辦士四〇六二五、美匯爲七元三七五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港美滙略回緊</p>

<p>昨日外幣市况、此漲彼跌、殊不一致、英美金鎊隨金價回漲一元五角、前者爲九十六元、後者開九十九元、美金票初做十三元七角、卒爲十三元九角三分、比上日回起一角三分、香港票大五分、坎拿大票及菲列濱票均漲一角、日金蔡升七厘、朝鮮票則降三厘、英金票亦小三角、法郎禀降一分、新加坡票低三角、荷蘭票落二角、安南票小五分、餘均不動、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、因美總統之聲明、人心因此又稍見懈怠、故市價因此亦殊安定、昨日買賣、進出已稀、市價已帶盤旋狀况、大概上午略疲、下午復堅、買賣雙方、上午生大源裕雖有買進、而永永康及散戶等賣出爲多、稍有供過於求之象、午後十一號·大豐·聯和·進胃較强、丙種復穿出六元、結果大都微好二三角、丁戊兩種略小五角一角、成交總數共計的六七十萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交紗布交易所股五十股、價爲三十八元七角半、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報告云、昨日股市微呈暗澹、一般價格、約略趨鬆、交易亦稀、賣方則無壓力、此殆由於時屆月杪、經營者多思關結帳目所致、</p>
<p>倫敦二十九日電、今日遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、大致平穩、祗麥加利銀行股上升二先令六便士、價爲六鎊七先令六便士、</p>

<p>紗市跌風漸起、升降範圍、又見擴大、此由於實際交易呆滯之故、華南方面對於細紗需要大减、西此市態未能鞏固、而傾向下降、惟十支粗紗採辦未斷、然市情未受細紗不振影響、兼之和平傳言繁興、人氣衰弱、亦牽入漩渦之中矣、不過原棉基礎不鬆、多頭尚安謐、未現驚慌之象、，</p>
<p>現紗晨開、同業相聚袖手不動、延至九時五十分一般掮客、呌喊聲才起、然實在交易缺乏、開價即跌七八元、雙馬現貨價爲七百六十五元、棧單價爲匕百三十元、少頃流言紛紜、一跌十元、現貨價至七百叫十八元、樓單價爲七百二十二元、旋以塌便貨者復來拖進、又復回升十元、查半日成交統計七百六十七包、行情雙馬跌十五元、雙地球跌十六元、天女跌十元、十支粗紗亦跌五元至十元、一日棉紗運海防六十件、運香港四十一件、茲將各帮口買去之額量如左、</p>

<p>現棉交易、轉趨靜寂、蓋以近來紗價在疲憊小振中、廠方辦意又趨淡泊之途加以外面和平傳說紛紜、允使疑慮叢生、因此交易大爲减色、然售價依然堅挺、此因各路到貨斷斷之故也、蘇北來源、通花未到、僅北沙來一千一百二十包、處此存貨單薄之下、從何而小、所以通州花價冉漲三四元、爲一百六十元、同業中買賣尚旺、出口有二百四十包運香港、茲將現棉售開情形列左、</p>

<p>另訊滬外棉交易、昨日又因即期匯票較鬆、折合外棉殊爲合算、故銀根較鬆之同業、乘機拖進者甚多、與十月期匯票相較、每擔可以廉宜六七元、美棉定貨交易、未見大量定出、祇有零星交易、此或以廠方因受市上各方謠傳所致耳</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約晨初較爲疲乏、開盤跌五六磅音後因南方套賣而再疲、繼又盛傳政府對於本年度新花、將舉行八分三厘之棉花貸款、因之市價忽形回好、結果較之上日漲五六磅音、印度連同預測跌七羅比、利物浦殊爲靜寂、埃及漲十餘磅音、</p>

<p>小麥　昨日小麥先穩後疲、自廠家連日收買後、更兼產價高昂、市面一度微俏、嗣以廠囤觀望、及粉市一蹶不振、局勢頓覺不支、結果高麥擯持乏交、中决一致鬆疲、統市售開崑山麥九元九角三分，太倉麥九元九角一分至四角七分、常州麥九元七角、福阜兩廠僅辦一千餘包、及囤戶收進四五車云、</p>

<h3 id="c55">僞市府圖收房捐　滬西居民均拒絕　惇信路崗位昨又遭侵佔　佈崗僞警已達三百餘人　遷居之風愈延愈廣 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>滬西越界築路地段、自被偽警侵入佔據崗位後、形勢顯呈緊張、據調查所得、越界地段偽警總數、巳達三百名、係由法華鎭偽「警察大隊」所派、偽方巡邏車並在界外武裝巡邏、偽「財局」並定今日起徵收冬季房捐、一般居戶、決聯合抗爭、租界常局、對該處警權、決不放棄、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>惇信路崗　位又被佔</p>
<p>越界築路區域、日來偽警行動、又行活躍、大西路惇信路口、日前突有偽警四名、在該處佈崗、昨日起、偽警又將該處崗位加以佔據、從事管理交通、原有巡捕、被迫退守於人行道上、至大西路哥倫比亞路口、偽警與巡捕、仍保持雙崗、抱不合作態度、當巡捕指揮南北交通時、而偽警則放行東西行駛之車輛、致行駛該處之車輛、極爲困難、</p>
<p>居戶厭惡　遷移益衆</p>
<p>曹家渡方面、偽警數量、昨日起已見减少、除駐守原有崗位指揮交通外、偽游巡隊、絕少在該處往來、表面尚稱平靜、在極司非而路愚園路及海格路一帶、日憲兵及偽警人數、顯然激增、到處可見彼等蹤跡、運輸卡車及機器脚踏車、更不絕於道、居民目擊心怵、深感困擾搬塲之風蔓延愈廣、空氣甚形緊張、但偽方歛財心切、聞偽「財局」已派員將各里弄戶口、調查淸楚、竟通告於今日起、開始徵收冬季房捐矣、</p>
<p>佈崗僞警　達三百名</p>
<p>滬西越界築路地叚、自被偽「市府」受某方唆使、實行侵入佈崗後、所有自靜安寺以西大西路·憶定盤路·海格路·憑園路·地豐路·安和寺路·極司非而路等各處叫义路口、均發現偽警蹤跡、除估據租界巡捕崗位外、四週沿行人道上、並站有携槍之武裝偽警三四名不等、據可靠方面消息、該項僞警、係屬僞「警察大隊」、隊部設於法華鎭、每晨由巡邏車載送偽警分赴各處佈崗、以三小時爲一班、「公」畢後、亦由巡邏車載回、現時侵入越界區人數、巳達三百名左右、同時複有巡邏車（按係普通商用卡車）上載偽警數名、携機槍一架、巡邏各處、故情形顯呈緊張、居民深感不安、</p>
<p>僞方竟擬　今日征捐</p>
<p>僞「市府」近因「維新政府」停發補助費、致經濟拮据、巳達極點、故覬覦在越界築路地叚、征收房捐、以挽頹勢、自偽警侵入站崗後、偽「財政局」即派員分赴各區里弄、調查戶口、並設立「滬西區稽征處」、辦理征捐事宜、頃悉偽方以經濟日（一日）起開始向各商店住戶、征收冬房捐、</p>
<p>商店居戶　一致抗爭</p>
<p>滬西商店居戶等、以偽方迫徵房捐、表示憤慨、昨據一般人表示、均謂目遭偽警侵入以來、一般居戶、羣情驚惶、紛紛遷避者甚多、致市面頓形冷落、今偽方更變本加厲、金圖强征房捐、多數商店及居戶等、均深明大義、對於偽組織絕對不予合作、倘欲征捐、當予以毅然拒絕、並將聯合一致堅決抗爭、一面仍盼租界當局採取有效處</p>
<p>滬西盜匪　橫行不法</p>
<p>滬西越界築路之西側、戰事西移後、該地因英兵駐防、未有損失、故店舖居家、鱗决櫛比、而工廠之由淪陷區搬遷者、亦莫不視此地爲避秦桃源、遂成相當之工廠區與熱鬧市塲、但英兵撇去後、該地忽多股匪數十帮、或數人、或十餘人、或二十餘人、頭目則一人、逮捕勒索、無惡不作、兩月以來、巳近百萬、</p>

<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>小朋友們不可等開視之</p>
<p>光陰眞快，一眨眼，今天父是十月的開始了，從季候　，陽曆的十月，正當農曆的仲秋，朔風初起，寒氣斜峭，大家易單（單衣）而夾，（夾衣）又是一番嚴肅的氣象了。街頭，屋角，多少被難的兒童，號寒啼飢的在流浪着，殺觫着，他們何以致此？享福的小朋友們，大家試閉目想想。</p>
<p>再隔八天，大家又要過着第三年抗戰期中（也可以說是國族蒙艱年）的國慶紀念日了。回溯自黃花岡七十二烈士殉難！至西曆一九一一年十月十日，革命軍起義武昌，民國因以誕生，中間苦難的歷程，拋却幾許烈士的頭頗，酒却幾許烈士的熱血，失敗了多少决數，然而卒能交織成中華民族的燦爛自由之花，獲得山河的重光。</p>
<p>當砲火響徹孤島叫週之際，我的幾個孩子，初度遇着火花滿天，（高射砲火），血肉飛濺中的國慶日，機聲，砲聲奏着熱烈而偉大的悲壯之曲，孩子們非但亳無恐怖，而且格外的精神興奮！我要謝謝它的賜與，我更感覺到抗戰弟一年中的孤島國慶節，最值得留戀，最值得回憶。會經挺在孤島上，在激烈的砲火聲裹，過着興奮的國慶節的小朋友們，想還記得很淸楚吧？</p>
<p>季節告訴我們，又是十月了。偉大的十月，我們要迎接它，鼓勵它，前方幾百萬的健兒們，正在踏着先烈的血蹟，前仆後繼的前進，兩年多了，還是搏鬥不懈。「失敗爲成功之母」，終有那麼一天，重再交織成中華民族的燦爛自由之花，獲得整個山河的重光。</p>
<p>小朋友們，現在正是你們埋頭讀書的時候，不要一刻虛擲，不要一刻放鬆。偉大的一十」字，又是耶穌博愛濟衆的典型，你們看到街頭，屋角，無家可歸的流浪兒童，應當知道自己的幸福和快樂，格外予他們以同情，予他們以救助。</p>
<h3 id="c88">秋季的自然界 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<p>下了幾陣大雨，天氣就凉了許多。人們不的而同的穿上夾衣；時候告訴我們說：「秋季了」。</p>
<p>秋季裏，自然界的景物，到底有怎樣的一番變換呢？</p>
<p>山野裏的小草，枯的枯了，黃的黃了。其實，它們已經留着宿根，地下莖或者種子，靜待着明春的萌發呢。蟲兒們漸漸少下去，因爲它們早已產了卵子，資任已經完畢：所以它們自己，也就一個個死去了，不過也有一小部分蚊蠅等，還留在溫暖的處所，偷偷地渡過這一個嚴冬。</p>
<p>那些薄葉的樹木，開始把葉裏的通道漸漸隔斷，因爲它怕這許多葉子露在猛烈的北風中，會使體內的水分很快的蒸發掉。不久，葉子就落下來了。那斷口用橡皮層封得緊緊的，使水分不會暗自跑出去。但是那裹厚葉和針葉的樹木就不要這樣做，因爲它們的葉子已經有很完美的設備，即使在極猛烈的北風中，水分也不會逃得很快的。</p>
<p>路旁的法國梧桐，不久便只剩着赤裸的枝榦了。馬路上因此也開朗許多呢。</p>
<p>你要知道，樹葉的作用漸漸停止以後，裹面的物質也起了變化了。因此有的變成紅葉，有的變成黃葉，對於這兩種變色的葉子，人們倒喜歡拿它做觀賞品。</p>
<p>蟲兒的减少，使食蟲爲生的動物，起了大大的恐慌。於是燕子開始會議，打算在一個晴朗的早晨，成羣飛到南方去。蝙蝠却預備冬眠，等到蟲類繁殖的時候，再從睡夢中醒轉來。</p>
<p>這個秋季的官然界就是這樣冷淡的嗎？不是的。</p>
<p>你看，菊花在園裹開了，東一簇，西一簇。雁兒從北邊來了。在空中一隊飛過。還有豆子，菜却都在這時候下種呢。</p>
<h3 id="c89">碾米 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>—明兒避難記之三十六—</p>
<p>明兒第三個家的西首，是一條山溪，那水流整日整晚汨汨地向低窪的溪道中淌去，無窮盡的流去，不諭在旱天，在雨天，在春天，在夏天，一年四季裹，總有水在響着，不過水聲時强時弱，那便是水多少的關係。允其在深夜中，那水聲奏演得異常的響亮，貫注在睡夢朦朧中的明兒，纏繞他個不休，煩厭的火燃燒在他的心頭，可是不能抑制住那刺耳的聲響。</p>
<p>一天，明兒帮助母親提了籃子，到溪邊去洗衣。那溪水淸澈得可以分辨在溪底的石子，不過水是沒有一刻靜止的。那水流到那裏才停？這竟引起了他的好奇心，便提着脚，跟了水流的方向走去，走去。</p>
<p>那溪隨着明兒脚步的搬動，逐漸的放闊，水流的速度也越發加緊起來。溪邊的石子，被急水天天的磨琢，竟沒有了稜角，時有一二頭美麗燦爛的翠烏，在那光滑的石面偶一逗留，剎那間一陣水冲來，驅逐了它們的鳩佔，洗凈了石面上的斑跡，重又圓溜溜地向着日光在發亮。明兒仍然前進着。</p>
<p>一列稻草紮成的排，長長的橫在溪的中央，把上游的溪水囤積了起來，那水愈集愈多，在草排的上沿不住的舖溢出來，水流過了這一重難關，格外的急了。那人造的壩，徒然引起巨大的急水聲外，有什麼其他的作用？明兒更不加思索的向前走去。走不了十多步，又發見一壖，水更是急促。隔了幾十步，又是十壩，水好容易的從這三重難關沒命的逃了出來。到得排水打從高高的壩上直瀉的飛衝下來，如一片銀白色的水簾倒垂在壩上，更吶那日光的反射，竟像一卷無價之寶的珠簾，五彩奪目，光煥四發，這般奇景，眞是少見。無數銀珠的泡沬在溪中石塊上飛濺開來，發出了瘋在般的怒吼。溪面上團團的漩渦打着廻旋，無主的流去。</p>
<p>一座木屋建築在那離壩不遠的地方，屋旁裝着一個巨大的木輪，輪片受到了急水的擊力，懶洋洋地旋轉着，更有一陣敲擊的聲音在木屋裏發響，明兒不由主的闖了進去。</p>
<p>那是兩開間的木屋，不十分高大，一袋袋的穀囤積在那裹，西個石製的臼鑲嵌在泥地裹，日裏滿貯着稻穀，靜待那裝在輪軸裹的木錐打下來。吱哩吱哩作響的輸軸，似乎很不願意的被水輸在轉動，可是被支配得不敢動彈，只得發着吱哩的怨聲。木椎英勇般的打倒臼裏云，稻穀被它猛力的壓迫，有的剝去了穀衣，有的還在崛强的抵抗，有的逃了臼的樊籠，可憐的又被那看守者——屋裏的碾米人——為虎作倀的捉了進去，最後的結果終是逃不了暴力的打擊，便赤裸裸的顯了原形，那便成了米。</p>
<p>椎擊聲，倫軸聲，夾着水流聲交織成一曲沒有結構的音樂，而米蒸氣又緊密的封鎖着那一間木屋，明兒受不了那一般窒塞性的刺激，便退了出來。</p>
<p>「碾米是這麼一回事！」他又得了這簇新的收獲，便笑嘻嘻沿着原路歸家了。</p>
<h3 id="c90">涎唾的功用 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 望鑌</p>
<p>唾液，俗稱涎睡；是人們所不可缺的物質。雖然我們常不注意它的功用。</p>
<p>小朋友！提起了涎唾，你們總會想到：每有食物在你們面前的時候，嘴裹的涎唾，總格外多些。一不小心時，就會淋了幾滴出來；有幾位小朋友，以爲這種現象可恥，於是就只得不斷地把它嚥下；也常會被人發覺，其實這並不可恥，因為涎唾對於食物進口時有極大的需要，所以在沒有進口之前就不能自主地分泌得持別多</p>
<p>涎哩的主要作用，當然潤濕嚼爛的食物，拌着食物的碎塊，使容易下嚥。允其對於乾燥的食品如妙米粉，餅乾等，更其需要。此外它還有一種作用，就是能消化澱粉，我們在細嚼白飯的時候，常覺稍帶甜味，這就是米中的澱粉被唾液分解而成糖類（葡葡搪）的結果</p>
<p>涎唾還能潤滑口腔，使舌頭活動自由，說話靈便。說話過久，便覺口渴，原因就在這裏。</p>
<p>俗語說：「涎唾就是藥，處處用得着。」這倒也不是虛話。譬如你偶然被螞蟻蜜蜂等咬了刺了，皮膚就要腫起來，要是你就用涎唾塗上，那紅腫的地方就會消退下去。這是因爲蜂蟻刺人的時候，把一種蟻酸送入人的皮膚裏；後經涎唾鹼性的作用，把蟻酸中和了的緣故。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們想想：涎唾是不是很有用的？</p>

<p>有一個很好的管家老太婆，每天早晨雞呌的時候，就要喊她的女僕起來。女僕們都怕早起，所以大家商量，把那可憐的老公鷄殺掉了。伊們說：「如果不是公雞喊醒了我們的主母，伊也不會來喊醒我們的。」但是那個好婦人，失去了鐘，（雞）就時常把鐘點弄錯，半夜裏就喊伊們起來：所以伊們不但沒有把事情弄好，而且比以前更壞了！（趙易林）</p>

<p>阿麗答道：「這有什麼可怕，我當然不怕的。伊說時，很有些瞧不起阿立胆小的樣子。可是阿立實在是個很小的孩子，今年才只八歲，而阿麗却快近十二歲了。當伊八歲的時候，也正和阿立一樣，動不動就要害怕，到現在看去，覺得都沒有害怕的理由了。伊還記得先前曾一二次，伊那年紀較長的表兄表姊們，也往往嘲笑伊的胆小，有意談鬼說怪，使伊吃嚇，作爲玩意兒。到如今每逢黑夜，不曾上燈時，獨有一人在房間裏時，還不免有些心虛胆寒哩。阿麗想到這裹，也就帶了溫和的口氣，安慰伊的弟弟道：「這當然一些也不用害怕的，我想起了那些藍矮子，只覺得好玩。阿立，你要知道事實上並沒有什魔天仙鬼怪這一類東西的。」</p>
<p>阿立忙道：但是矮子總是有的，剛才那個小老頭兒，不是明明是個矮子嗎？」阿麗道：「是啊，矮子原是矮子，然而不能歸在天仙鬼怪一類中去，他們也是人類，不過生得矮小一些罷了。也許他們在幼年的時候，會很厲害的跌過一交，才使他們不再長大起來，永久是那麼矮小的了。」阿立道：「原來如此麼？我倒不知道這個。我希望自已先前沒有跌得厲害過才好，因爲有許多人都說像我這樣年紀，是不應當如此矮小的。」說着，很祖憂似的瞧他那雙短而有力的腿。</p>
<p>阿麗止不住大笑起來道：「呵呵，阿立，你眞是個滑稽的孩子，這担憂是多餘的。要知你決不是一個矮子，將來你目會一年年强壯長大起來的。」阿立放下了心，重又回到那藍矮子問題上去，慢慢地說道：「但是我覺得這件事總有些奇怪；你正在談起藍矮子，不道就有一個矮老頭兒在街上走來，走過我們的窗前。阿麗，你不見他對我們瞧時，模樣兒怪滑稽的，好像他已聽得了我們談話似的。」麗道：「其實這村子裏的人鮮着我們都是如此的。也許他們的眼光中，瞧我們倆都有些滑稽。像你的那件水手衣，我的一頂絨線帽，他們少見多怪，也正如我們見了村婦們的紫色衫子和明藍裙子，都覺得奇怪呢。</p>

<h3 id="c93">熊佛西的　「賽金花」 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>熊佛西是現代戲劇作家中較早出且也有相當地位的一員。聽說一千他的作品被編在文學研究會「通俗戲劇叢書」中，因此不滿，以爲是小覷了他。其實作品能够通俗，使得大衆能够接受，正是不容易達到的地步，熊先生何妨在這方面用其所長呢。</p>
<p>即如，他的短劇「藝術家」寫畫家裝死，就幾乎接近文明戲或「鬧劇」。此决他的「賽金花」在璇宮劇院上演，諸如平劇貴妃醉酒和戰太平的挿曲，小撲虎的增入，都使得此戲加添不少愉悅和樂的成分，無怪乎林柯向我說起，「此戲相當的熱鬧」了。許幸之的「阿Q正傳」也有向這方面走的現象。我很高興，希望多產生幾個關漢卿或李漁，不一定要人人都是白樸或湯顯祖！</p>
<p>但是，如果從通俗劇的觀點去看，「賽金花」似乎也有過新之感。因爲此劇不僅有「迴溯」，由劇中人說起過去的事情，並且還有「省略」，這些省略的部分都要讀者用思索來補充。比方說，賽余花見瓦德西的場面，夏衍市實寫的，熊氏却用暗寫；賽金花被諧入獄，所買妓女自盡，也都用暗寫：這些都是看慣有頭有尾的文明戲，或電影的觀衆所不大習慣的。不過，暗示很多，頗能引起注意，這使得觀衆减去不少困難。所以，即使是文明戲觀衆，稍加努力，也還是可接受的。</p>
<p>此劇悲劇的氛圍氣似較夏作為濃厚，雖然基調是一樣的——帮助了人家，反被人家忘記。賽金花是中國的「羊脂球」（莫泊桑小說。）夏作僅以妓院出走爲悲痛的最高點，熊作則先之以入獄，繼之以老年的窮愁潦倒，極能動人，使人幾乎不忍看下去。以醉酒起，以醉酒結，全劇融成一片，也頗見巧思。</p>
<p>如晦的改編，可稱讚的是結尾，這不僅僅是把賽金花的人格提高，更要緊的是要我們不要忘記了現實。</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>中國電影製片廠，簡稱「中國。」成立於民國二十六年十月一日，本來隸屬於軍事委員會政訓處的電影股，擴大組織後，改稱中國電影製片廠。因此，今天恰是「中製」的兩週紀念。</p>
<p>當初政訓處的電影股所以擴大組織，改成「中國」，主耍的目標，當然在攝製戰時影片。但接着爲了中國軍隊的一再內移，「中國」也就由南京移到漢口，再由漢口遷到重慶。直到現在，還是在重慶進行製片工作。</p>
<p>戰事發生而後，上海南京等處一部分前進的電影明星，也就出發到內地去担仟電影與戲劇的救亡工作。而那時「中國」就羅致了不少有希望的男女影星。不過現在一般影人，在「中國」工作者，待遇很低。就是第一流的明星，月薪也祗有六十元左右。所以不拘男女明星，目前在重慶的生活都非常樸實，不帶一些電影明星的習氣。</p>
<p>「中國」搬到重慶而後，在過去的兩年之中，曾拍攝過二十多部戲劇片和紀錄片。這些影片，上海雖爲了特種關係，不能公映，但在西南各地，凡是比較熱鬧的城市，都會映過。在重慶，膠片來源的缺少，天時的不適，都足影響製片工作，有時竟使中國」暫停拍戲，否則我想兩年來「中國」的出品，決不會祇有二十多部呢！</p>

<h3 id="c98">今日之羅馬尼亞　波蘭分割以後脣亡齒寒 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 吳芝軒</p>
<p>介乎兩大之間頗難對付</p>
<p>未及一月的德波戰爭，終於在德蘇瓜分之形式下，使波蘭解體了。居於脣亡齒寒地位的羅馬尼亞，恐怕是侵略者的第二目標。然而羅馬尼亞將如何呢？</p>
<p>侵略者眼中物</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞是一個農業原料豐畜的國家；農產物之富，可稱東南歐的主要食糧庫；而石油的出產史爲豐富，其產量每年的在七白萬噸以上。歐洲各國機械化部隊听需的石油，頗多求給於此。而德國父是「無的」國家，對於羅馬尼亞石油的需要更殷。這一大資源—石油，穀物—德國若能攫爲己有，那就不怕各國對德海軍封銷，或禁油制裁了；儘可高枕無憂地取給於羅馬尼亞。所以豐富的石油，肥沃的土地，怎不使侵略者垂涎欲滴而思染指？</p>
<p>上次歐戰結束後，羅馬尼亞的領土增大了一些；除戰前原有的領土外，更從保加利亞割來肥沃的多不魯甲；從匈牙利割來美麗的達期西瓦尼亞高原及巴拉特：更趁俄國鬧革命的時候，把她於一八一二年所喪失的比沙拉比亞收復；靠背後的英法勢力的支持，使她毫不費力的統治該土地，達一十年之久。然而今日其鄰國波蘭是潰敗了，環境亦突變了；該幾個收復的或割來的土地，正是未來粉援的隱患。誰能担保這虎視耽耽的侵略國不假此藉口，而來攫奪豐富的羅馬尼亞的資源呢？</p>
<p>鐵衛團之蠢動</p>
<p>希特勒侵略慣技，專喜製造一國內亂，然後達到其不賞一兵一彈而佔領之目的。羅馬尼亞的納粹鐵衛團，就是他以財力接濟的，指使其搗亂政府，巳有多年歷史，勢力相當的大。去年三月羅王卡洛爾深慮鐵衛團爲患，捕獲鐵衛團團員達二百人，速首領哥特里亞努也在共內，定其背叛祖國之罪，判處十年苦役，因此鐵衛團之氣燄稍戢。今年年初，哥特里亞努因越獄而被擊斃，雖曾使德國大爲震怒，但羅王態度堅决，使希特勒亦無可如何。</p>
<p>不料事隔半年餘，正值歐洲戰亂之際，羅馬尼亞之鐵衛團又乘機而動，於九月二十一日刺設內閣總理兼國防部長加利納斯哥。可知羅馬尼亞的鐵衛團勢力依舊存在，趁此國際多事之秋，蠢蠢思動。</p>
<p>外來的脅迫，及內在的危機，的確使羅馬尼亞的命運，瀕於火藥爆發的尖端，那末羅馬尼亞將何以自處呢？</p>
<p>他的未來命運</p>
<p>據最近羅京傳出的路透電訊，避入羅馬尼亞之波蘭總統莫錫基與波軍總司令米格里資匕將，皆被當局扣留。這是羅馬尼亞恐怕侵略者的藉口，不得已而出此：</p>
<p>然而此項政策，在其命運尚未根本改觀之前，不過祇能暫時延緩被侵略而已，對於其四周的危機並無若何减輕。</p>
<p>最近土耳其外長薩拉哥格魯抵莫斯科，將建議一蘇，土，羅，保叫國公的，藉以保障蘇聯，土耳其，羅馬尼亞，及保加利亞之現有疆界，所以羅馬尼亞之局勢如何，要看蘇聯的態度如何？同時也要看德國今後究以全力對付西歐民主國家，抑先向東歐各國進攻而定。</p>
<p>經濟常談</p>
<h3 id="c99">外匯與套息 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 永生</p>
<p>一、何謂外匯</p>
<p>外匯爲我國對其他各國之匯兌行市，因各國所用貨幣不同，有用金本位者，有用銀本位者，且各國成色與重量各異，故貨幣之債值亦不一致，所謂外匯，即我國貨幣與各國貨幣問匯兌之行市，如英匯，美匯，法匯，德匯，港滙即爲我國法幣對英美法德及香港貨幣之滙兌行市。</p>
<p>二、外匯之價格</p>
<p>外匯在平常時期，因貿易及其他關係，供需兩方互相自山買賣，價格相差不遠，但自抗戰以後，爲防止資金逃避，實行統制外匯，現定除必需之進口品所需外匯，得申請由中央銀行供給外，其他一概不得購買外匯。上海因情形特殊，除中央銀行掛牌之法定匯價外，另有黑市外匯即暗盤市價。暗盤行市有二，一爲匯豐銀行掛牌價，一爲市塲買賣價，近來報載之外匯緊縮與漲跌，係指暗市而言，查市塲買賣，因貿易關係，祇有英匯及美匯兩種，茲將九月十九臼外匯價格，擇數種重要者，列表於後：</p>
<p>莢滙　每國幣　元合英金價</p>
<p>中央銀行掛牌</p>
<p>一先令二辨士半</p>
<p>匯豐銀行掛牌（賣價）</p>
<p>三辨士半</p>
<p>市塲買賣價（收盤）</p>
<p>四辨士三四三七五</p>
<p>美匯　每國幣百元合美金價</p>
<p>中央銀行掛牌</p>
<p>三十元</p>
<p>匯豐銀行掛牌（賣價）</p>
<p>五元半</p>
<p>市場買賣價（收盤）</p>
<p>六元八七五</p>
<p>法國電匯</p>
<p>每法幣百元合法郎價</p>
<p>中央銀行掛牌</p>
<p>一·〇八〇法郎</p>
<p>匯豐銀行掛牌（賣價）</p>
<p>二五三法郎</p>
<p>香港電匯</p>
<p>每法幣百元合港紙價</p>
<p>中央銀行掛牌</p>
<p>九五港紙</p>
<p>匯豐銀行掛牌（賣價）</p>
<p>二三·二五港紙</p>
<p>（附註一）上列中央銀行掛牌之</p>
<p>匯價，自戰事發生以來，</p>
<p>米有更動，至滙豐銀行掛</p>
<p>牌價，與市塲買賣價，常</p>
<p>有變化。</p>
<p>（附註一）中央銀行掛脾價爲一虛價，至於原訂之法定價格供給外匯之外匯請核辦法，現已取消。</p>
<p>三、套息之發生</p>
<p>套息俗稱套利，因外匯行市，有近遠期之分，若近賤速貴，買進近期，同時賣出遠期，可得一差數，此差數即所謂套息是也。差數愈多，即套息利率愈大，外匯套息，主動者，（即貼出利息者）大都係外商銀行，各外商銀行，因需要（俗謂頭寸）關係而定，差額之大小，各行並不一律，且大都於成單上寫明，此項外匯必需存於該行，不計利息，由該行出一存單或收據，故外匯套息，可云外商銀行向國人吸收之信用借款。而大部套息，均以美余爲計算單位。</p>
<p>四、套息利率之簡便算法</p>
<p>套息利率之計算方法有兩，一爲普通算法，一爲簡易算法。</p>
<p>茲將簡易算法列後：</p>
<p>（本月份行市減下月份行市之差數）＋（下月份行市）＝利率（月息）</p>
<p>假如八月十四日美金價，八月份六元半，九月份五元八七五，差額爲〇·六二五元，求套息一月合利率若干。</p>
<p>0.625÷5.875=106.38</p>
<p>即合月息十分零六厘强（附註）上項所求得之利率，經</p>
<p>紀人之佣金未除。</p>
<p>外匯套息在本年一月至五月，其利率平均在四五厘及五六厘之間，六月份行市，頗多變動，套息利率有一分，二分，三分，叫分之別，至於七八兩月套息利率最高曾至十一二分，即做外匯套息，法幣一萬元，一個月後，可得利息法幣一千一二百元，利率之高，開從來未有之驚人記錄，但九月份（即上月份），聞因外商銀行不願貼出利息，套息尚少成交也。</p>
<p>觸景生情—一個避難的華北人</p>
<h3 id="c100">洞庭會戰　話長沙 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>自今年「九一八」晚間湘北日軍猛犯新牆河以來，戰况日趨激烈，以爭奪長沙爲中心的洞庭湖大會戰，業已展開序幕。去年十一月十二日受過大火洗禮的長沙，乃又爲全國人十所矚目，。</p>
<p>長沙地勢</p>
<p>長沙古名潭洲，五代馬殷入抑稱楚，自遜淸以來，回來是湖南省治，戶口殷繁，工商輻輳。論其地勢，南通嶺表，北指荊鄂，左掖章貢，右挈黔中，據湘省襟要，控南北樞紐。一濱湘江與瀏渭河的交會地，形勞雄壯，鐵路貫通，舟車四達，交通亦異常便利，因此，凡瀏陽之夏布，醴陵之瓷器，湘江之米，安化之茶，都集中於此：米市最盛，除蕪湖外，居全國第二</p>
<p>當地名勝</p>
<p>城西江心有水鷺洲，浮沉於織波中，草木葱綠，景物淸幽，縱目遠眺，有如夜雨瀟湘，頗涉冷趣。遜淸咸豐二年（一八五二）洪秀全軍從粵省北上，圍長沙，淸軍向榮戰於城外，擬奪水鷺洲，剛在渡江，即被洪軍繞洲尾襲其後，淸軍三千大潰，幾於全體覆沒，向榮狼狽遁去。此役在我國近代民挨解放戰史上，可算留一奇績。</p>
<p>湘江對岸的嶽麓山，又名雲麓，舊稱爲衡嶽七上二峯之尾閭，見於荊州記。諸峯疊秀，曲徑通幽，竹木扶疏，泉澗奔流，遠望長沙，烟樹渺茫，下窺湘江，風帆掩映，實長沙第一勝地。山半有工業學校，相傳爲宋嶽麓書院舊址，張拭朱子皆曾在此講學。山之高處，則締造民國偉人黃克强蔡松坡二先烈的墳墓，赫然在望。近代學術界名人丁文江先生的遺體亦下葬於此。</p>
<p>空前浩刦</p>
<p>去年十月十二日的長沙大火，眞可說是千古浩刦！一座如錦如織的湘垣，結過五日五夜的焚燒，所有精華差不多都化爲焦土。當時，鐵路綫的日軍還在新牆河以北，遠離長沙一百十五公里以外，公路方面的日軍，亦在平江北六十公里的九嶺以北，長沙警備司令酆悌等，事前誤信流言，臨時又慌張躁急，致釀此巨變，雖巳明正典刑，實在是死有餘辜！長沙原有四十二三萬人口，八萬餘住戶，戰後人口的增加了十萬，大火前逃走了十分之九以上，餘下來的應不下三萬人，而葬身火窟的竟在二千以上！</p>
<p>經過這决大火的打擊，長沙應該是一蹶不振了；可是湖南人的勇氣眞够人佩服，不到四五個月，長沙已從焦土中慢慢復蘇過來，人口逐漸增加曾到過三十萬，直到最近才再疏散開去，據說又不過三萬了。</p>
<p>軍事價值</p>
<p>至於這次日軍企圖長沙，多牛是出於政治上的理由，誠如路透社所傳，不過想在偽中央政權成立的前夕，放一個爆竹，聊資點綴罷了。據華軍高級戰略家的意見，就華方的整個戰局說，自武漢南昌岳州陷落後，長沙的得失巳無關緊要，但目前華方所以派遺精銳部隊扼守湘北者，其目的不僅在保衛長沙，而允在消耗日方的軍火與人力。日軍雖妄想在攻取長沙後，一方面打通粵漢路，與其粵北的部隊，取得聯絡；一方而沿公路向西北進攻沙市宜昌；無奈湖南的地勢適常江漢平原與洞底湖南的邱陵地帶非常險峻，洞庭北浸，衡獄中峙，五嶺南橫，在在蔚爲天險。猶憶在北伐當年，國民革命軍佔領衡陽後，吳佩孚軍即放棄長沙，直退到湘鄂邊境再作決戰，可見長沙在軍事上無死守價值。今後華軍縱然爲戰略關係放棄長沙，仍可步步爲營，而湘西衡陽寶慶間的萬山叢中，允將爲雙方決戰之所。何况三湘健兒任俠尚義，最富於愛國精神，地理人和都顯然於華軍有利，日軍冒險深入，無異自殺！所以這决長沙的爭奪戰，日軍幸而得手，所奪到的，不過是一片焦土。，而華軍即使放棄，却是引敵深入的先聲。</p>

<p>名人軼事</p>
<h3 id="c101">料事如祌的法國陸軍總司令　甘茂林將軍 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 吳瑛</p>
<p>法國的陸軍總司令甘茂林，是一位資格很老最得人望的老將軍。他在英法二國的軍事家中，實在是最有經騐的優秀人才。在上次入戰中，他在戰續彪炳的霞飛將軍的麾下，擔任陸軍少校職銜，當時曾獻計擬將法軍撤退與英軍聯合，攻擊敵人在里爾的右翼陣綫，但起初，這個計劃，霞飛沒有就採用。等到八月二十五日，陸軍左翼感受重大威脅時，霞飛才折服甘茂林的料事如神，就開始執行，令他前往統率各軍撒退事宜。後來霞飛將軍又因利用德國卡克將軍，孤軍深入，中了敵計，忙派甘氏迅將法國巴黎的駐軍，調至瑪倫陣綫作包圍剿擊，在此役中，甘氏充分表現了他的才幹，在預定時刻內，完成任務。在開戰那年的十一月，就升任爲總部少將參謀，至一九一六年一月，他才離開霞飛，去充任駐案模海港的第二先遣隊指揮官。至一九二五年，他又奉令幫助解救叙利亞友軍之圍的一役，英名大著，至一九三五年一月，他繼魏剛將軍而為法國的陸軍總參謀長。聽說甘氏對軍事地理學一門，極有研究，這對於他的克敵制勝有很大的幫助。因此他非常重硯這一部門，在訓練他部下的時候，軍事地理學就被列於重要的學科。他對於戰略和戰術，也有十分深刻的研究，由法國大革命起至大戰結束止，每一次重要的戰役及戰略的經過，成敗的關鍵，都有淸楚的認識。現在他雖是白髮蕭蕭的老翁，但精神矍鑠，一如靑年。所以這次的出膺重寄，一定能勝任愉快吧。</p>

<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>一到秋天，氣候漸漸地凉爽，不像那暑天的酷熱煩悶，所以在生活上便感覺舒適了許多！但是有幾種疾病，如痢疾呀，瘧疾呀，傷寒呀，却都在秋天好像應時而與的流行起來，所以我們一方面在秋天過那比較舒適的生活，一方面仍須提心吊膽，防那些疾病的來侵。現在我寫一些關於痢疾瘧疾傷寒等預防的話，不過是秋令中大家防病的一些常識罷了。</p>
<p>（一）痢疾</p>
<p>A原因　痢疾有兩種：一種是感染赤痢菌而起的，在排出物祇有黏液和膿汁的時候，呌做白痢；如果含有多量血液的時，就呌做赤痢。一種是感染阿米巴而起的，呌做阿米巴痢。</p>
<p>B預防</p>
<p>（一）蒼蠅是傳染痢疾的媒介，一切飲食物，都要用紗罩罩好，沒有紗罩的食物，一槪不吃。</p>
<p>（二）勿飮生水。</p>
<p>（三）一切水果，最好去了皮吃</p>
<p>（四）勿和患有痢疾的人，用同、一便具。</p>
<p>（五）病人所用的食具，切勿入口；病人用後，要用沸水冲洗。</p>
<p>（六）侍護病人，每接觸病人一次，要用藥皂手一次。</p>
<p>（七）對於病人的排出物，可放入石灰，旣可殺菌，又可杜絕蠅類的樓止。</p>
<p>（八）有痢疾可疑時，一經檢騐排出物，便可診斷病原，易於對症發藥。</p>
<p>（二）瘧疾</p>
<p>A原因　瘧疾的病原體，是一種屬於原蟲的寄生蟲，呌做麻拉利亞胞子蟲。都由蚊蟲做傳染的媒介，傳染的途徑，就是蚊蟲吸了病人的血，血中含有病原體，在再吸他人的血液時，便把病原體過渡了。一經傳染，因麻拉利亞胞子蟲的種類和發育形態的不同，有左列三種不同的症狀；</p>
<p>（一）三日然（就是隔日熱）</p>
<p>（二）四日熱</p>
<p>（三）熱帶熱</p>
<p>以上三種中，要算熱帶熱的症狀最重，不過這是流行於熱帶地方的瘧疾，在溫帶地方，是不常有的。</p>
<p>B預訪</p>
<p>（一）要努力做滅蚊工作</p>
<p>（二）臥床須用蚊帳</p>
<p>（三）在瘧疾流行的時候，每三日服余雞納霜兩片。</p>
<p>（四）瘧疾的可疑時，一經檢騐血液，立可斷明，可使治療方面，不致延誤。</p>
<p>（三）傷寒</p>
<p>A原因　傷寒是由腸窒扶斯桿菌侵入人體而起，蒼蠅是傳染本症的媒介，一切含有傷寒病菌的飲食物，是感染本症的途徑。</p>
<p>B預防</p>
<p>（一）和預防痢疾的方法大略相同。</p>
<p>（二）在傷寒流行時，可施行預防注射，或內服傷寒伐克辛。</p>
<p>（三）有傷寒可疑時，從檢騐血液和糞便，便可得到凖確的診斷，而易於治療。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Unless Poland's Sovereignty Is Restored, Britain and France State There Can Be No Peace; Disregarding German-Soviet Economic Assistance; Hitler's Peace Offensive Intended as a Threat <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Paris - The French government announced last night that it had obtained a large number of documents that could prove a secret military alliance between the Soviet Union and Germany. Accepting the Soviet Union's clear statement at this time that peace is impossible without the restoration of Poland to its original state, France must continue to fight until Hitlerism is completely eliminated. Although the Soviet Union's assistance to Germany, such as the supply of oil and wheat, may make it difficult for Britain and France in the war, it will have no impact on their determination to fight. Furthermore, the lack of Soviet sea and land transport capacity may prevent them from fully supplying Germany. At the same time, Britain will intensify its blockade of Germany. French Prime Minister Daladier and French Army Commander Gamelin studied the peace proposals issued by the Soviet Union and Germany in Moscow at the External Affairs Residence yesterday, with Deputy Foreign Minister Léger assisting. General Gamelin's belief in ultimate victory has not changed at all. In Daladier's telephone conversation with Chamberlain yesterday, the consistency of the British and French positions was proven. British and French officials unanimously believe that Hitler's peace proposals are the basis for building peace in Eastern Europe. France is not unaware of the Soviet-German diplomatic and economic assistance, and also believes that the Soviet Union and Germany may have signed a military alliance treaty. As of last night, the French government had not yet received formal peace proposals from the Soviet Union and Germany, although it had long been aware of their content. It is also possible that the Soviet Union and Germany did not intend to submit them because Britain and France had already indicated their rejection in advance. (30th Associated Press)</p>
<p>Moscow - Observers here recently stated that the Treaty of Friendship and Borders signed by Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Molotov and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has effectively divided Polish territory and established a permanent link between the two countries, because both sides have the same interests in suppressing the Polish national restoration movement. The goal of the economic agreement signed by both sides is to implement economic cooperation so as to adjust the production of both sides in the coming years. In other words, Germany will exchange manufactured goods for various raw materials from the Soviet Union so that the trade relations between the two sides will return to the highest level of trade between the two countries in 1931 (according to this year, the total trade volume between Germany and the Soviet Union reached 1.1 billion marks). People in diplomatic circles said that although the Treaty of Friendship and Borders between Germany and the Soviet Union is not a military alliance treaty, it is actually the basis for a military alliance, because this treaty stipulates that if a third country first attempts to interfere in the settlement of the Polish issue, Germany and the Soviet Union will definitely not tolerate it. Since Britain and France have always recognized Poland as their ally, the treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union states that threats should not be added to Britain and France. The joint declaration between Germany and the Soviet Union states, "The governments of Germany and the Soviet Union shall work together to find ways to end the war between Germany and Britain and France. If this effort fails, the responsibility for prolonging the war shall be borne by Britain and France. At that time, Germany and the Soviet Union shall consult each other and decide on the necessary measures." This statement is another threat in itself. Furthermore, the declaration also states that Germany and the Soviet Union will often seek cooperation with other friendly countries when necessary in order to achieve their goals as soon as possible. Regarding this point, foreign observers all stated that the Soviet Union has clearly understood that it is difficult for Britain and France to reach a compromise with Germany. In the future, it is important to note that it will earnestly support Germany in the current war. (29th Havas)</p>
<p>Moscow - Although there is a provision in the German-Soviet agreement stating that if Britain and France reject the German peace proposal, Germany and the Soviet Union will consult on necessary plans, which is intended as a threat, most observers here believe that there is no military alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union, and that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's mission failed due to the non-existence of a German-Soviet military alliance. If Britain and France refuse to accept the peace proposals of the two dictators, Hitler and Stalin, Germany will be almost completely isolated. According to extremely qualified observers, the purpose of the Soviet-Estonian treaty is to prevent future German attacks rather than to completely dominate Estonia. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin - After the conclusion of the border and friendship agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, German political figures generally believe that this is the final reorganization of Eastern Europe, and hereby declare Germany's attitude. It should be stated that the purpose of Britain and France's war is to assist Poland. Now that Poland no longer exists, Germany and the Soviet Union have expressed their determination to maintain the reorganization of Eastern Europe. Germany has repeatedly stated that it has no intention of fighting against Britain or France. Therefore, it seems that there is no reason for Britain and France to continue fighting. (30th Haitong)</p>
<p>Berlin - After learning the initial reaction of the Allied countries to rashly reject the joint Soviet-German peace movement proposal, the Nazi Party authorities here today advised Britain and France to "reconsider" before rejecting the peace proposal. Authoritative sources claimed that the joint Soviet-German declaration was the final proposal for peace, and no further official documents would be issued. At the same time, they stated that the main point of the Moscow Communiqué was the right of third countries to speak on the future issue of Poland, and that it could not be limited by a peace conference. (30th Associated Press)</p>
<p>London - People here are still studying in detail what kind of practical assistance the German-Soviet agreement has for Germany. According to Soviet trade statistics, the goods exported from the Soviet Union to Germany have decreased from 30 million pounds to 4 million pounds between 1931 and last year. Germany's exports to the Soviet Union have also decreased from 47 million pounds to 2 million pounds. Last year, due to increased domestic needs, the Soviet Union's production of pig iron, copper, lead, aluminum, zinc, tin ingots, nickel, etc. was not enough for its own use, and there was no surplus for export. The Soviet Union's huge resources can easily be developed under the guidance of German experts, but it is difficult to do so in a short period of several months. Military critics generally expect that Soviet troops will not appear on the Western Front, but it is possible that tanks and aircraft will be lent to Germany. Some critics even said that since Stalin has obtained everything without fighting, why should he participate in the war now? Naval critics said that the agreement between the Soviet Union and Estonia allows the Soviet Union to establish naval and air bases on the Estonian islands. Germany must feel unhappy about this news, because in this situation, the Soviet Union can control the Gulf of Riga and dominate the Baltic Sea. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Returns to Berlin</p>
<p>Berlin - Hitler returned to Berlin from Wilhelmshaven port last night, waiting for the reply from Britain and France. After the German-Soviet agreement was signed in Moscow on Thursday, Hitler made a peace proposal to Britain and France based on the agreement. Here, it is hoped that the reply from Britain and France can arrive here on the first day of the semester. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned to Berlin from Moscow last night and immediately visited Hitler to report on the trip. (30th Associated Press)</p>

<p>Istanbul - Ankara diplomatic circles widely rumored that the full text of the mutual assistance and economic agreement between Turkey, Britain, and France has reached a final compromise. It is said that the agreement will be signed immediately after Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu returns from Moscow. Responsible Turkish authorities insisted that the new Soviet-Turkish treaty does not hinder Turkey's promises to Britain and France, and that Turkey's treaties with the Soviet Union, Britain, and France are all aimed at maintaining the status quo of the Balkan Peninsula and the Black Sea, and ensuring the security of the Mediterranean. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - London reports that a Turkish military delegation is heading to Britain. A private telegram from Ankara confirms this matter. Officials have not yet confirmed it, but well-informed people believe that this matter is true. It is said that the delegation's mission is to discuss the method of supplying arms based on the soon-to-be-signed Turkish-British-French mutual assistance agreement. (30th Haitong)</p>
<p>Moscow - Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu is scheduled to leave Moscow today. Yesterday, the Soviet-Turkish talks suddenly broke down. It is unknown what the main reason for the obstruction was. Political figures were surprised to learn that the British news agency announced that Turkey would sign a mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France and would conclude an economic cooperation agreement within a few days. The Soviet side has not yet disclosed to what extent the Turkish Foreign Minister's talks in Moscow have reached. (30th Haitong)</p>

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - German-Yugoslav economic negotiations have recently begun here. According to a statement issued by Minister of Commerce Andreš, "Germany is our country's largest market, and we are unwilling to give it up. At the same time, our country is willing to strictly maintain neutrality in the current war." Well-informed sources said that Germany does not intend to ask Yugoslavia to increase the amount of food exports, but will insist on exporting as much copper, iron, zinc, lead, aluminum and other mineral sands to Germany as possible, regardless of the price, and is willing to allocate the necessary trains for transportation.

<p>London - British newspapers today condemned the German-Soviet Pact. The Times called it a proud and evil document, saying that the long-awaited "peace offensive" was nothing more than a trick, and even if it were well-disguised, people would sneer at it. There can be no peace without the destruction of Hitlerism, and its relationship with Stalin will be determined by the fact of revealing its own intentions, but Herr Hitler's will has not yet been revealed. We have never sought to interfere with the Soviet Union. As for whether the Soviet Union wants to make things difficult for us, we must wait and see. The Daily Telegraph said that Germany's desire to use the Soviet Union to guide the hope of peace will eventually fail. If the Soviet Union threatens with hostile actions, the response from Britain and France will naturally be the same. However, Stalin is very cautious and will not take chestnuts from the fire for others. The Daily Mail said that Hitler wants peace at a fixed price, and we reject his terms. We keep our promise to restore Poland and will not make peace with Hitler and his ilk. The Daily Herald said that we need not admit that the German-Soviet Pact may have significant implications, but Britain's determination and purpose will not change. The News Chronicle: The conditions of peace that can make the world breathe again and move upward can be proposed today and discussed tomorrow, but such conditions do not recognize aggression. We have drawn our swords for freedom and will not turn back until the act of dominating other countries by force has come to an end. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris - French newspapers unanimously rejected the Hitler-Stalin peace proposal. Le Figaro published an article by former ambassador to Romania, Daumergue, saying that there can be no peace with those who have abandoned everything in diplomacy and ideology. (30th Reuters)</p>

<p>Moscow - The Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Pact, signed here on September 28, was approved yesterday by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. (30th TASS)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Agreement has been approved by the governments of both countries. The Soviet military delegation is now scheduled to head to the Estonian capital tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. In addition to army, navy, and air force personnel, the Soviet delegation also includes several engineers to plan the construction of defensive projects on Vormsi Island, Hiiumaa Island, and Paldiski Port. It is learned that the above-mentioned three military projects will begin construction in the near future. (30th Haitong)</p>
<p>Moscow - Estonian Foreign Minister Selter, after signing the Mutual Assistance Treaty with Soviet Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Molotov, is scheduled to fly back to Tallinn tomorrow morning. Foreign observers here recently commented on this treaty, saying that as a result of the reconciliation between Germany and the Soviet Union, the survival of Poland has been sacrificed. Now, Estonia has also lost its independence and has become a Soviet vassal state. From then on, the Soviet Union can occupy Vormsi and Hiiumaa Islands and Tallinn Port, and strategically control the key to the southern part of the Gulf of Finland. In addition, Latvia originally had an alliance treaty with Estonia, but it did not participate in the talks between the Soviet Union and Estonia this time. (29th Havas)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Today, newspapers here paid more attention to the Soviet Union's conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty with Estonia than to the German-Soviet agreement on a common border. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the European war has given the Soviet Union a good opportunity to take advantage of the fire, so the Soviet Union will definitely maintain neutrality, because doing so will create many similar opportunities. After establishing an Estonian "protectorate," the Soviet Union can control the Polish coast, and later wait for the opportunity to advance in the Balkans. The Asahi Shimbun also said that since the Soviet Union has realized its desire to control the Baltic Sea, it seems unlikely that it will take further action against Latvia, Lithuania, or Finland, but will focus its attention on the Black Sea region. As for whether the war will immediately spread to the Balkan Peninsula, it is difficult to determine, but Britain, France, and both Germany and the Soviet Union will wage fierce diplomatic wars in the Balkans.

<p>London - The Information Department recently issued a communiqué stating that British aircraft attacked several German warships in the Heligoland Bight in the North Sea. At that time, although the German anti-aircraft fire was very fierce, our aircraft were still able to fly low and drop bombs accurately, but several aircraft have not yet returned to base. (29th Havas)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - News from London has confirmed the report from the German Supreme Command that five or six British bombers were shot down when attacking the German Navy near Heligoland. According to the British Air Ministry, British bombers disregarded the dense anti-aircraft fire of the German warships and flew low to drop bombs. However, the British report did not mention the results of the air raid, only stating that several bombers failed to return to base. This report can indirectly prove the news that British aircraft were shot down. (30th Haitong)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to responsible military sources here, a total of 19 enemy aircraft and two balloons were shot down when the German Air Force engaged in air battles with British and French aircraft this week. In addition, five British aircraft were shot down again by the Germans yesterday when they bombed the German Navy. Therefore, Germany has shot down a total of 24 enemy aircraft since the 24th of this month. (30th Haitong)</p>
<p>Berlin - The General Command recently issued a communiqué stating that six British combat teams bombed the German fleet in the Heligoland Bight in the North Sea today without hitting anything. German destroyers immediately took off to intercept them, engaged in battle, and shot down five British aircraft. (29th Havas)</p>
<p>London - The American wireless station broadcast the message last night that one of the National Army's ships has been damaged by German aircraft. The British Navy has just acknowledged that it is true that a British warship was attacked by German aircraft, but it was not hit and even less sunk. In addition, the Information Department issued a communiqué stating that British aircraft pilots had caught sight of a German submarine on the Atlantic Ocean, immediately circling to investigate for fifteen minutes, aiming at the target, and dropping several bombs. Soon, oil slicks floated on the sea surface, which did not dissipate for a long time, proving that the submarine had been sunk. (29th Havas)</p>
<p>Berlin - Two teams of British fighters, a total of twelve aircraft, attempted to invade German territorial waters along the North Sea coast. One team attacked destroyers in a German bay without success. The British aircraft were repelled by German anti-aircraft guns and the German side suffered no losses. The other team encountered German fighters and five of the six British aircraft were shot down. (30th Haitong)</p>

<h3 id="e12">What the United States Expects <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, international changes have been complex and confusing. In addition, international schemers, in order to achieve their own country's goals, have fueled the flames, creating all kinds of smoke and mirrors. The propaganda world has picked up bits and pieces, turning them into neurotic inferences. For example, rumors are spreading that the Soviet Union is re-emerging on the European political stage. Therefore, it has reached a mutual understanding with Japan, allowing Japan to take free action in the Far East. Moreover, because Japanese Ambassador Shigenori Togo met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Geneva, foreign observers have further speculated that Japan and the Soviet Union intend to harm China's war of resistance. As a result, people who are concerned about the overall situation in the Far East cannot help but speculate and become deeply worried. In fact, the two years of war have been enough to make Japan realize that it is impossible to subdue China by force. It is also well known that China's war of resistance does not depend on any country. Even if some countries that sympathize with China have changed their international policies in other aspects, so far, there has been absolutely no change in their attitude towards China. Therefore, China's foreign policy, as Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui said, is entirely based on treaties, especially the Nine-Power Treaty, with the purpose of thoroughly maintaining China's territorial integrity and sovereign independence; it has never wavered from beginning to end. Furthermore, looking at the international situation, the United States' policy is the most stable and most in line with China's foreign policy. Since President Roosevelt took office, what he has proclaimed to the international community is that the main purpose of American foreign policy is to "do its best to eradicate war between nations;" at the same time, he is working hard to build a greater navy to deal with aggressors who use war as a tool. The two echo each other, but with different tones; in other words, his large navy plan is being promoted very rapidly, while his steps to deal with aggressors are slow. After the past few years and up to now, the United States' pressure on aggressors has gradually intensified. At the end of last year, he raised a protest that was very substantial in content but not particularly special in appearance; but in July of this year, he announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with lightning speed. This calm and unhurried expression will surely make the part of the Japanese people who have not yet gone mad realize that this is a serious warning. The reason why the Japanese Abe Cabinet appointed Nomura to adjust relations with the United States in order to concentrate its efforts on solving the so-called "China problem" lies here. Now that the Japanese side feels the seriousness of the warning, and still wants to use diplomatic skills to deal with it hypocritically, the United States' expression of its stability and firmness is not limited to diplomatic maneuvers. For example, the aircraft carrier Langley and many other warships sailed to the Philippines; bomber squadrons and reconnaissance squadrons flew from Honolulu through Midway Island and Guam to the Philippines. This is the first decision of American warplanes to cross the International Date Line; and a large submarine fleet was sent from Pearl Harbor to the Philippines to enhance the maritime defense capabilities of the United States Asiatic Fleet; Importantly, the United States Navy Department announced that it would hold large-scale naval exercises centered on Hawaii, and most of the fleets on the west coast were also transferred to Pearl Harbor; although the United States government does not think that these actions are related to the European war or Japan's intensified invasion of China, who can say that they are meaningless, blind actions! For example, the United States Army Department allocated US$12 million to open up two large airfields in Honolulu, and the Navy Department allocated a large sum of money to build harbors and air force bases in Honolulu and Pearl Harbor, as well as Roosevelt's announcement in mid-July to build strong air force and submarine bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and allocated US$14 million to build an air force base to defend Panama; and US$40 million to build an air force base in Alaska; all these large-scale military expansion plans cannot be regarded as a waste of wealth or relief for the unemployed! Japan understands this very well, so when her new foreign minister took office, he made it his basic policy to improve relations with the United States, and the reason is nothing more than this. It is not difficult to improve relations, and it is not difficult to revise the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation; changes in foreign ministers and envoys, and even cabinet reshuffles, are not a problem; as long as there is an honest and fair reply to the memorandum at the end of last year. This is the only expectation of the United States. It is also the only key between the United States and Japan!</p>

<p>(Paris) The Paris General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 52, stating, "Last night, the entire line was calm and uneventful. Our troops patrolled the east bank of the Saar River once." (Havas telegram dated 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 51, stating, "Enemy artillery was quite active today on the east bank of the Saar River, south of the cities of Zwei-Brücken and Bitsch. Both enemy and our aircraft have conducted reconnaissance flights." (Havas telegram dated 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) President Lebrun went to the Maginot Line area on the northeastern border today to inspect the army, and met with General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, and a certain Corps Commander of the Front Line Commander. He witnessed that the front-line troops and the civilians in the rear were able to maintain a courageous and calm spirit, which he greatly appreciated. In addition, Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac was accompanied by General Vilmin, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, to inspect several air squadrons that recently participated in the war. (Havas telegram dated 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to informed sources, the French high command is currently trying a certain strategy, not eager to launch a large-scale offensive against the Siegfried Line. This strategic expectation of time will continue until the German army is truly fighting on the Western Front. The French army's last local offensive has repeatedly proved the principle of first capturing a place with fierce artillery fire and then occupying it with infantry. After exerting their combined power, the French artillery and infantry have penetrated five miles into the front, closer to the Siegfried Line. The German side has realized that it is impossible to defend the area. British and French aircraft have repeatedly conducted reconnaissance flights behind the Siegfried Line without being obstructed by German fighter planes. Recent French war reports stated that enemy artillery fire was launched in the area east of the Saar, especially in the territory south of Bitsch and Sarre-Union. Reconnaissance battleships were quite active on both sides. (Reuters telegram dated 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French High Command announced last night that the French army attacked the German positions on the Moselle River near Pirmasens yesterday, advancing one mile, with a five-mile-long battle line. The French army has so far occupied 50 German villages. The French army has also made progress in Saarbrücken, "with very few losses." The French army's goal is to contain both banks of the Saar River in the Saar region. The French artillery is in a position of great advantage, forcing the German army to withdraw from the entire Saar mining area. After French reconnaissance planes flew over German territory, they reported that a large German army was concentrated behind the front. German anti-aircraft artillery damaged several French planes, but all planes returned to their bases. French Communiqué No. 52 stated, "Today, enemy artillery on the east side of the Saar River attacked our army in Zwei-Brücken and Pirmasens. Reconnaissance agencies of both Germany and France are active on the front line." (Associated Press telegram dated 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin The German High Command announced last night that the British Air Force attacked the German fleet near Heligoland yesterday, but "failed." Five British planes were shot down by German planes. (Associated Press telegram dated 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A French military commentator heard today that Saarbrücken has been surrounded on three sides and is about to fall. Although the German army wants to contain the French army's actions, the French army continues its war, slowly and orderly. Its purpose is to encircle the Siegfried Line in the central salient of the Saarbrücken town. The French army is now using a shearing action to pressure the core defenses of this town.

<p>(Bern, Switzerland) The German High Command recently issued a communiqué stating that the Przemyśl Fortress in southeastern Poland, originally occupied by Germany, was transferred to Soviet troops yesterday. In addition, after the Warsaw city garrison surrendered, it is now being gradually dispersed, which is expected to take two or three days to complete. The German army will enter the city on October 2nd. The garrison of the Modlin Fortress west of Warsaw has also collapsed and surrendered. (Havas telegram dated 29th)</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, heard that Sweden's shipping industry throughout the world has almost been paralyzed due to submarine attacks. It is widely believed that the Swedish commercial delegation currently in London should request a more effective escort system. The reason why the Swedish merchant ship Nerland was sunk by a submarine off the coast of Norway yesterday is incomprehensible, because the ship is a neutral country's vessel, departing from a neutral port and sailing to another neutral port. Local newspapers stated that the maritime war has apparently shifted to the territorial waters of the Scandinavian countries, and that the British claim that Britain's method of resisting submarines is now extremely effective may be proven by this. According to the captain of the Nerland, when he was on the German submarine, he was sure that the submarine had received detailed information from the land about the ship's movements. Other shipping industry people also said that an espionage system with many members and a well-organized organization must be at work. It has now been discovered here that some foreigners who used to live frugally have recently spent extravagantly. According to a visit to Antwerp, Belgium, by the Paris Evening News, 5,300 tons of ore sand delivered to the Liege steel plant in Belgium have sunk to the bottom of the sea along with the Nerland. The sinking of this ship has aroused the indignation of the people in Antwerp. The shipping industry is now suggesting that the governments of the countries that participated in the Oslo Conference should lodge a protest. (Reuters telegram dated 30th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden After the Swedish freighter "Nierlant" was sunk by a German submarine in the western waters of Norway yesterday, the government recently ordered the minister to Berlin to protest to the German government, and stated that "the goods carried by the 'Nierlant' were transported to neutral Belgium, and should not be considered contraband. We hereby reserve the right to claim compensation for damages." (Havas telegram dated 29th)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland The Neue Zürcher Zeitung recently reported that Germany and Britain have laid a large number of mines in the southwest waters of Denmark. The Danish authorities have decided to clear them, and have organized a fleet to search for them everywhere in order to protect the country's shipping safety. During the last European war, Denmark also worked hard to clear the mines laid by the belligerent countries, totaling no less than 10,000. (Havas telegram dated 29th)</p>
<p>Oslo, Norway After the Norwegian ships "Djerv" and "Jorn" were sunk in the North Sea and the "Solas" was sunk in Skagerrak, a spy fled Norway yesterday. It is widely believed that the activity of German submarines is related to the activities of these spies in various Scandinavian ports. After they find out the date and itinerary of the ship's movements, they report to the Berlin authorities. The Norwegian authorities have paid close attention to this matter. The crew members of the "Djerv" and "Jorn" received warnings before being attacked and were allowed to go to Sangegaard on lifeboats. The crew members of the "Solas" were rescued by a Swedish ship.

<p>Panama City The Pan-American Conference is scheduled to hold a full secret meeting tomorrow. Today, the Economic, Peace, and Neutrality Subcommittees will examine the proposals of various countries separately. The representatives of Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay have jointly submitted a proposal on wartime trade issues. The representatives of the United States, Brazil, and Argentina are studying a proposal to delineate a safe zone around the Americas. In addition, the representative of Venezuela submitted a proposal on protecting neutrality, advocating that the American countries must decide on a common attitude towards submarines, aircraft carriers, all warships, and armed freighters of the belligerent countries, and propose that in addition to delineating a safe zone along the coast of the Americas, a "neutral space" should also be drawn in the sky. (Havas telegram dated 29th)</p>
<p>Panama City Informed sources at the Pan-American Conference learned last night that the subcommittee has decided to remove the item of food from the list of contraband. This proposal was submitted to the conference by Argentina and Uruguay. However, the United States and Argentina cannot agree on the issue of neutrality. The United States' position is that there is no need to set up a uniform blockade zone around the Americas, and each country should decide to set up a zone of 50 or 100 miles, but war activities must be stopped near ordinary transport lines. The United States will oppose Argentina's request for the right of neutral countries to freely make loans. The United States pointed out that it is difficult for the country to approve this motion of South American countries, that is, to obtain loans from the United States and then lend them to the belligerent countries. (Haitong telegram dated 30th)</p>
<p>Mexico City The Senate recently passed the Neutrality Law under emergency procedures, prohibiting all submarines of the belligerent countries from entering Mexico's territorial waters and prohibiting all aircraft of these countries from flying into Mexico's airspace. This Neutrality Law is used to supplement the International Law signed at the Hague Peace Conference in 1907. (Havas telegram dated 29th)</p>
<p>Panama City Representatives of various countries at the Pan-American Conference continued to hold talks today, still focusing on the topic of delineating a safe zone on the western periphery of the Americas. The conference is waiting for the proposals to be submitted by the representatives of the United States and Cuba. Other representatives have already unanimously expressed their approval of the principle of this proposal. In addition, people at the conference commented extensively on the establishment of various agreements between Germany and the Soviet Union yesterday, saying that the only consequence of this move is enough to make the representatives of certain countries who sympathize with Germany feel disgusted.

<p>Washington Secretary of State Hull recently told the press that he had not heard of the rumors that Germany and the Soviet Union had proposed peace talks, advocating the convening of a peace conference and inviting a neutral country, namely Italy or the United States, to attend and participate. The reason why the aggressor countries propose peace talks is obviously to legitimize their conquests. If the United States were to participate, it would definitely not be approved by public opinion in the country. President Roosevelt also told the press that he knew nothing about the invitation to the United States to attend the peace conference. This kind of rumor is indeed very suspicious to us. Informed sources said that even if Germany and the Soviet Union launched such an initiative, it would be difficult for the United States to accept it, because the current foreign policy of the United States is to try its best to avoid getting involved in the vortex of European countries' territorial issues. (Havas telegram dated 29th)</p>
<p>Washington President Roosevelt reiterated at the press conference yesterday the United States' intention to maintain a neutral attitude towards the European war, and said that all questions can be answered with this. However, the President was unwilling to discuss the amendments to the Neutrality Act and the Western Hemisphere security zone. A reporter at the scene once requested the announcement of the industrial mobilization plan, and the President's answer was not only very slow, but also very deliberate. He said roughly, "We have not participated in the war, and I don't think we will participate in the war, so I think this matter may not be valued by the public." In addition, the President reiterated that all actions of the government are implemented in accordance with the principles of peace, because the United States hopes to maintain a neutral attitude towards the European war. The President also said that the national patrol ships have received reports of foreign submarines operating in the waters of the United States, but no evidence has been obtained yet. (Associated Press telegram dated 30th)</p>
<p>New York After Germany and the Soviet Union concluded an agreement in Moscow yesterday, the news that they would immediately propose peace proposals to Britain and France was published by local newspapers with headlines such as "Peace of Gangster Robbers," and editorials were published at the same time, roughly saying that no American opinion would have any illusions about the meaning and value of this kind of peace offensive. The Democratic New York Times stated that "Britain and France can never accept peace under such circumstances. The agreement concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union is more like propaganda material than a practical treaty. Its only major consequence is the obstacles that Britain and France may encounter in rebuilding an independent Poland in the future, not only Germany, but also Germany and the Soviet Union." The Republican People's Advocate stated that if Britain and France accepted the peace talks at this moment, it would be equivalent to a temporary truce. "After the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union was concluded, the Führer Hitler failed to regard himself as a victor, but wanted to achieve peace, because he was unwilling to make any concessions to Britain and France, and only used force to seize peace. The German-Soviet treaty is just a few scraps of paper, and it is not enough to bring about peace." (Havas telegram dated 30th)</p>

<p>Washington Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently told the press that the amendment I proposed is to amend the Johnson Act to a certain extent. (Note: The Johnson Act stipulates that countries that have not repaid their debts to the United States may not obtain loans in the United States again.) "Because the Johnson Act was established in peacetime, now that the European war has broken out, we must have a way to deal with the new situation in Europe. Germany does not owe the United States any war debts. According to the Johnson Act, it can borrow loans from American citizens. On the contrary, Britain and France are restricted by this law and have no way to obtain fear-term loans in the United States. I do not believe that the Senate is willing to facilitate Germany and make Britain and France suffer disadvantages. This is why the Johnson Act must be amended." (Havas telegram dated 29th)</p>
<p>Washington The Senate is scheduled to submit the Neutrality Act Amendment (i.e., the amendment proposed by Pittman, Chairman of the Committee) passed by the Foreign Relations Committee for discussion on the 2nd of next month. The senators of both the pro and con factions are currently busy drafting speeches. At that time, there will be a heated debate with sharp tongues and swords. Political figures believe that the center of the debate between the two sides will be nothing more than two points: (1) Abolishing the arms embargo clause, (2) Giving each belligerent country a credit loan of 90 days. Regarding the second point, Johnson, the creator of the Johnson Act and the Republican Senator Johnson, strongly opposes it, but the current Neutrality Act does not prohibit the American people from giving short-term loans to the belligerent countries. However, when the Senate discusses it, it may mention the war debt issue and cause criticism from the isolationists, so the passage of the Pittman Amendment may be more difficult, which is a matter of concern.

<h3 id="e22">Japan Hopes to Reopen English-Japanese Negotiations to Discuss Tianjin Issues <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today carried news that the English-Japanese conference will soon resume, stating that after the establishment of the Abe Cabinet, the British Ambassador, Craigie, formally proposed continuing the English-Japanese talks. This was likely around September 5th. Kato, the Japanese special envoy in China, is expected to meet with Craigie today. The British Embassy neither confirmed nor denied the possibility of a meeting between Kato and the British Ambassador today. It is heard that the Japanese side proposed that the issue of the Tianjin incident should be brought up for discussion again from the point established on August 15th. The Asahi Shimbun claims that Britain is forced by the European war to change its policy towards Japan, but the Japanese government has no such intention. The English-Japanese talks broke down as a result of direct clashes of opinions, and there have been no major changes in international relations or the Far Eastern situation. The Japanese government is now willing to temporarily set aside the general rights issues between England and Japan and discuss issues of maintaining public order in Tianjin and other places. Britain has withdrawn its Consul-General in Tianjin, Jameson, and will soon recall its Ambassador to China, Knatchbull-Hugessen. These moves by Britain give people the belief that there may eventually be a fundamental adjustment in English-Japanese relations in China. However, discussions on such fundamental issues are not yet ripe, because Japan's proposal to Britain and France on September 5th to withdraw their troops from China is still pending. Regarding this matter, Britain and France must first take concrete steps. The Hochi Shimbun claims that Japan will insist that Britain must abandon its pro-Chiang Kai-shek policy to comply with the spirit of the Arita-Craigie Agreement. The Kokumin Shimbun states that it is now known that Foreign Minister Nomura's proposed changes to the personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be completed before the resumption of the English-Japanese talks. Therefore, it is still questionable whether Kato will remain the chief Japanese representative in the English-Japanese negotiations, as Kato will be responsible for important matters related to the organization of the Wang Jingwei new regime. It is said that the person mainly handling the English-Japanese talks will be Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tani Masayuki. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: This morning, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while receiving reporters from Japanese newspapers, strongly denied the news carried by the Asahi Shimbun and other newspapers that the English-Japanese conference on the Tianjin incident would be resumed soon, saying that the Japanese government has not yet received any proposal from the British side regarding the continuation of the Tokyo conference. Observers here who are qualified believe that the Japanese government, in view of the international situation, is now adopting a cautious attitude towards resuming this conference. Unless there is a real prospect of a peaceful resolution to the various issues between England and Japan, the Japanese government may not accept the British proposal, even if there is one, because if the second English-Japanese conference is suspended again, the relationship between the two governments will inevitably deteriorate further.

<p>Changsha: The Japanese army that invaded southwards from Fulin along the official road was ambushed by the Chinese army again on the 29th in the Tangtianmiao Wanggongqiao area, 60 li north of Changsha. After a fierce battle until the morning of the 30th, more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers fled in panic, leaving corpses everywhere.

<p>Changsha: After the Chinese army in northern Hunan was ordered on the 25th to make an active strategic shift, it used mobile warfare in conjunction with positional warfare to sandwich the Japanese army in Nanbo and Miluo on the outskirts of Changsha. On the 28th and 29th, it ambushed the Japanese army in Fulinpu, killing more than 4,000 Japanese soldiers in total. After the battle of Xinqiang, the Japanese army suffered another heavy blow, which was quite棘手 (棘手: troublesome). (30th telegram)</p>

The Chinese army also captured more than 10 machine guns. The battle was still fierce at the site on the evening of the 30th. Also, a group of Japanese troops from Shangshiji, 60 li south of Fulinpu, harassed the area, and were also met with Chinese counterattacks. On the 30th, the fighting on the outskirts of Changsha was most intense in the Jinjing Shangshiji area. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Japanese army that invaded southwards along the northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway sneaked to Qiaotouyi, 60 li north of Changsha, from Sanxingqiao, and a fierce battle occurred there with the Chinese army. On the morning of the 30th, they were still in a standoff in the nearby mountains. Another group of Japanese troops that invaded southwards along Fulinpu were ambushed by the Chinese army on the 29th and suffered heavy setbacks. Although the Japanese army sent a part of it east to Jinjing, 40 li south of Pingjiang, in an attempt to eliminate the threat on its flanks, it was painfully blocked by the Chinese army on the morning of the 30th, and suffered heavy casualties. It has now retreated west and stopped at Shuanghuajian between Fulinpu and Jinjing, waiting for reinforcements. Also, Xiangyin has fallen on the 27th. The Japanese army is now sending minesweepers to clear the blockade on the river north of Xiangyin day and night, in an attempt to use the gunboats of the Dongting Fleet to go up the river and help invade Changsha.

<p>Chongqing: Today, we received military news from the Chinese side, stating that the Chinese army on the west bank of the Han River in northern Hubei crossed the river on September 27th and launched a general attack on the Japanese army's positions on the east bank in order to reduce the pressure exerted by the Japanese army on Changsha. The Chinese army on the opposite bank of Zhongxiang has captured Changshoudian and is now shelling the Japanese army's positions in the southern suburbs of Zhongxiang. The Chinese army is also advancing towards Yingshan and the vicinity of Suixian, west of Wushengguan on the Pinghan Road, northwest of Hankou. Another Chinese army is also advancing towards Xinyang and Pingjingguan on the Pinghan Road. At the same time, the Japanese army north of Changsha divided into two routes yesterday to invade southward. One route advanced along the Guangdong-Hankou Road and has reached Sanjiqiao (transliteration), and the other Japanese force advanced along the old road to Changsha and has reached Fulinpu. Japanese planes bombed Xiangtan and Zhuzhou yesterday, and Japanese reconnaissance planes also flew over Hengyang, Qiyang, and Lingling. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, we received military news from the front line in northern Hunan, stating that there is fierce fighting near Xiangyin and Baishui near the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The battle east of the railway in Pingjiang is in progress. The Japanese army there is now trying to advance towards Changsha along the main road from Hankou to Changsha. The Chinese army is resisting strongly, and a certain commander is personally supervising the battle at the front line. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Guilin: The battles on the outskirts of Changsha have been extremely fierce in recent days. The Chinese army, which is firmly defending the junction of Pingjiang, Xiangyin, and Changsha, has used the precipitous mountains to inflict heavy losses on the Japanese army. The Japanese attempt to advance south has obviously suffered a major blow. On the morning of the 29th, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers, who sneaked to Baiyu, Qiaotouyi (north of the Yangtze River), and Shangshiji along the railway line, were attacked by the Chinese army in different directions. After suffering casualties, they did not dare to advance further. There was fierce fighting in Kuzhukou (northeast of Qingshan City) in the area between Qiaotouyi and Shangshiji. In addition, a part of the Japanese army, more than 300 strong, invaded Huayong'an City (33 kilometers from Changsha) at 3 pm on the 29th. The Chinese army immediately took the posture of encirclement and annihilation and blocked it. The Japanese army dared not fight back and fled to the northeast. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>Changsha: After the Chinese army inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army on the line north of Baishui and south of Daqiao in the past few days, the position has become more stable, and the Japanese army's offensive has also been frustrated. The Japanese army in Fengxin invaded westward on the evening of the 29th, aiming to increase the Japanese flames in northern Hunan, but suffered heavy casualties in a battle near Shangfu.

<p>Chongqing: He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration, today denied the rumors that Changsha had fallen, and said that the Chinese army is determined not to let the Japanese army easily occupy Changsha. According to military news obtained here today, the fighting is currently the fiercest in the Xiangyin area. After a day of fierce fighting yesterday, the front line has expanded to the east and west. The closest point of the Japanese army to Changsha is Malinpu, which is only 45 kilometers away from Changsha. The Japanese army that crossed the Miluo River to the south advanced in two routes yesterday. One route advanced along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and the other route advanced along the ancient road on the east bank of the Miluo River. It is reported that this is the location personally commanded by the commander of the Chinese army. Also, in the past three days, Changsha has been indiscriminately bombed by Japanese planes day and night, with more than 200 bombs dropped. Wenyizhong School (transliteration), Zhizhong School (transliteration), and thousands of other houses and thatched houses outside the East Gate have been destroyed. At the same time, Xiangtan, the junction of highways, and Zhuzhou, the junction of railways, were also bombed yesterday morning. (Associated Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to front-line news received here today, the Chinese army in northwestern Hubei Province is now concentrating on a powerful counterattack against Japan in order to relieve the danger in Changsha. The Chinese army in Suixian is advancing rapidly towards Yingshan and Pingjingguan, threatening the positions of the Japanese army in Leidonggu and Xihe. The Chinese army that crossed the Han River northwest of Zhongxiang captured Changshoudian on Wednesday. According to the military spokesman here recently, most of the Japanese troops attacking Changsha were transferred from Hubei Province. (Associated Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese army, in order to cooperate with the battles in northern Hunan and southern Hubei, has been restless in Xinyang recently, feigning attacks on Pingchangguan and Wanggang from east to west. There have been artillery sounds from time to time. On the 20th, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers bombarded Yuelou Wujiapo and other places via Wulidian with more than a hundred rounds of shells, appearing to be invading Luoshan. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Japanese army, which invaded the Chinese territory of Pingjiang via Tongcheng and around Jiangxi Province, was divided into two routes. One route, with more than a thousand infantry and cavalry and four cannons, invaded south via Benshaqiao and Zhuxichang on the evening of the 27th. At 9 am on the 28th, it came into contact with the Chinese garrison in the area north of Longmenchang (110 li northeast of Pingjiang). The other route was the main force of the Japanese army, which crossed the Gaiwenling and attacked the northwest side of the Jiangshiguan Chinese Longmenchang. The Chinese army resisted the danger in the Wan Mountains. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. The Japanese army was exposed to corpses everywhere and suffered heavy losses. The battle in the north also intensified from morning to noon. The Chinese army charged back and forth, and more than half of the Japanese army was killed or wounded. Then, on the border (5 li north of Longmenchang), a situation of confrontation across the river was formed. Until the evening of the 29th, more than 200 Japanese soldiers in civilian clothes sneaked to the vicinity of Longmen south of 口口口. The Chinese army is encircling and annihilating them. Also, starting from the morning of the 29th, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Taoshugang from both sides, and another unit attacked the flanks of the Japanese army in Longmenchang from the area of 口口. The rear of the Japanese army has been cut off. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to a telegram from Changsha, the battle in northern Hunan is still stalemated near Baishui Street. The Japanese army in Dongting continues to move restlessly and is sending reinforcements to Yingtian. The Japanese army invading southern Hubei is fighting fiercely with the Chinese army and has the potential to invade Pingjiang. The Chinese army is blocking them. The Chinese army attacking Zhongxiang has captured Changshoudian and is pressing on Suixian. (30th telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e25">General Li Zongren Talks About the Reasons for China's Inevitable Victory, Launching a Full-Scale General Counterattack When the Time is Favorable. The Purpose of Attrition Will Soon Be Achieved. <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Before General Li Zongren returned to the front line this week, he told the Associated Press reporter, "China is now on the road to victory. China can achieve final victory when one of the following three conditions is met: (1) When the Chinese army launches a full-scale general counterattack at a favorable time; (2) When China's war of attrition against Japan causes widespread war-weariness among the invaders; (3) When external pressure on Japan greatly increases." According to General Li, China can continue to fight for many years in order to fully realize the above three conditions, but he believes that it is not necessary to test the people's perseverance to the extreme. General Li continued, "The 33 divisions that Japan initially sent to China can be said to have been almost completely exhausted. The Japanese side has repeatedly attempted to encircle and destroy China's elite, but every decision has failed. As for today, the battle situation is completely different from the early stages of the war. In the early stages of the war, the Japanese side was able to concentrate a large number of troops because it could use the superior transportation lines along the coast, the river, and the railway. As for now, the front lines are too scattered, and the Japanese army can no longer concentrate on one or several points. Even if the Japanese army can concentrate on one or several points, we can easily cut off its rear transportation lines. On the other hand, our troop strength can be said to be increasing every day, and millions of new soldiers have been trained. When the time is favorable, when the success of the general counterattack is certain, our new army will launch a large-scale counterattack. When this time comes, the initiative will be in our hands, so only we can know where to attack and when to attack. At the same time, the large amount of troops we use will surely make the other party flee at the sight of us. Even if Japan opens up the country to send reinforcements, it will be in a doomed position. Furthermore, the current Sino-Japanese war is a stimulant for China in terms of spirit, but the morale of the Japanese side, whether on the battlefield or in the rear, has gradually declined. In the early stages of the war, the Japanese soldiers we captured often committed suicide by cutting their abdomens, and none of them were willing to answer questions from the Chinese side or provide information. But today, the situation has changed greatly. Most Japanese soldiers are happy to find opportunities to surrender to us because the war has been prolonged and completely contrary to the expectations of their superiors. At the same time, when they arrive at the prisoner-of-war camp, they see that life is very peaceful, and they are willing to talk freely. Therefore, a lot of valuable information from the Japanese side is obtained. At the same time, the Japanese soldiers we are encountering now are not as scary as in the early stages of the war. The Japanese soldiers who come to China today are either older or younger. Among them, what the former misses most is the problem of the living pressure of their families during the prolonged war." General Li Zongren, the commander of the northern Yangtze River theater in central China, has been in Chongqing for several days and has discussed with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. When he flew back to the theater headquarters, he had a three-hour long talk with the reporter (from 11 pm to 2 am). General Li was full of energy and was very interested in talking, but the reporter was almost exhausted during this long meeting. According to General Li, his subordinates, in addition to being able to fight the Japanese army on the positions, also use lightning-fast guerrilla tactics from time to time to cut off the rear transportation lines of the Japanese army on the Pinghan Line, the Longhai Line, and the highways in the areas nominally occupied by the Japanese army. Talking about the current Japanese offensive against Changsha, General Li believes that the Chinese side has sufficient preparations to cope with the Japanese offensive and more than enough. However, if the Japanese side uses absolutely superior force, the Chinese side should abandon Changsha, just as it has abandoned other cities in the past, but not sacrifice the troops needed when the general counterattack period comes. Furthermore, even if the Japanese take Changsha, they cannot control the entire section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and even the Wuchang section they control can be cut off by the Chinese side from time to time. Moreover, the purpose of the Japanese taking Changsha is not military, but political, because the anti-war sentiment in Japan is extremely strong and there must be news of a new victory to excite them. But in the end, the Japanese army will be cut into pieces by the Chinese side and annihilated. (Associated Press Far East Manager Marshall, 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">China Has No Possibility of Peace Until the War of Resistance is Won. Foreign Minister Wang Issues a Special Statement to Supplement His Talk on the 27th. <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui previously told Marshall, the Far East manager of the Associated Press, that the United States is in the position of a mediator in the Sino-Japanese war. Now Dr. Wang has issued a supplementary statement to this remark in order to clarify his position. The statement stated, "I said in my speech on September 27th that the National Government is determined to resist until the end, until China achieves final victory. I now say that our war of resistance against Japan is not only for the independence and integrity of China, but also for the maintenance of international treaties (including the Nine-Power Treaty). We will never lay down our weapons unless this goal is achieved. As for the level of the United States' position in the Far East mentioned in my speech, this is my personal opinion. My personal opinion is that the United States can indeed achieve a great deal in the Far East in terms of the situation. The United States has the power to seek a fair solution to the Sino-Japanese war based on the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the note to Japan on December 31, 1938. At the same time, this action by the United States is also in line with the policies we have always held. However, my views should not be misunderstood, because I know deeply that only when the goal of China's war of resistance can be achieved and the final victory can be achieved, will peace be possible." It is reported that the reason why Foreign Minister Wang continued to issue this statement was that foreign reporters, seeing his talk with Marshall, asked him to provide a more complete and clear explanation of the basis on which the United States could serve as a mediator. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: In the Foreign Minister's talk, it was said that it was most appropriate for the United States to speak to Japan at this time, and it was not specified that the United States was expected to mediate. Because the Associated Press added emphasis, causing misunderstandings in all parties, there will probably be some explanation. (Special telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Recovers Monanzhen. The Remaining Japanese Troops Collapse to the Southwest. The Chinese Army is in Pursuit of Victory. <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Luoyang: On the southern Shanxi front, the Japanese army, which converged from Yuxiang, Ershililing, and Fenglingdu, and invaded eastward, is now entrenched in Ruicheng with about a thousand people, about eight or nine hundred in the southern village, about eight or nine hundred in the Nan'ai village, and about four or five hundred in the Ximo village and Weigong village area. The Japanese army in Monanzhen has been fiercely besieged by the Chinese × unit for days, and the Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. On the 27th, the Chinese army launched a renewed bayonet assault and captured it in one fell swoop. The remaining Japanese troops collapsed to the southwest, and the Chinese × unit took advantage of the momentum to pursue, and has reached Weigong village and continued to attack Ruicheng. (Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The Japanese army in the three strongholds of Changzhi, Changzi, and Huguan, which were besieged by the Chinese army, has suffered heavy casualties after two months of separate annihilation. Although the Japanese army has broken through several times, it has been fiercely intercepted by the Chinese, and has not succeeded so far. Since last week, the Japanese army has changed its strategy, on the one hand, holding on to the corner, and on the other hand, launching battles on the north end of the Baijin Highway and the middle side of the Hongtun Highway, in an attempt to cooperate. The battles between the two sides in recent days have been extremely fierce. More than 2,000 Japanese troops in Guchengzhen (north of Qin County) in Qin County invaded eastward in separate routes on the 26th and fell into Wuxiang at Chenshi on the 27th. A certain Chinese unit has rushed to the residence to meet the attack. More than 1,000 Japanese troops in Liao County also invaded southwestward in separate routes on the 25th, one part westward through Xiaolingdi and fell into Guoshe on the 26th, and one part southward into Wenquan, attempting to echo the Japanese army in Dongyangguan. In addition, on the Hongtun Highway, the Japanese army in Fuchengzhen fell into Nankongtan on the 27th and contacted the Japanese army in Mabi (north of Qinshui) in an attempt to aid Changzhi. At this moment, the Chinese army from all directions has begun simultaneous operations on the inner and outer lines, and is fiercely encircling and annihilating the Japanese army.

<p>(Fancheng) The guerrilla warfare in central Anhui has recently won another victory. The Japanese army, which was confronting the Chinese army at Xiatangji, which belongs to Hefei County on the Huainan Road, suddenly crossed Zhuangmuqiao on the morning of the 22nd, and occupied Caojia'an, and joined forces with the Japanese army in Zhuxiang, totaling more than 500 people, with three cannons attached, and fled towards Shouxian. It was blocked by a certain Chinese unit in Dagudui, and finally turned to defend the nearby mountains due to insufficient firepower. Although the market town was lost, it was counterattacked and recovered by the Chinese that night. The remaining Japanese troops broke through and fled towards Maxu, and were ambushed by the Chinese army in Laishanji, and fled back to Baijia'an in a panic. It is estimated that more than 100 Japanese troops were killed in this battle, and many trophies were seized. (2) On the morning of the 21st, more than 200 Japanese troops in Chaoxian invaded Yuncao and were repelled by the Chinese army, and more than 20 Japanese troops were killed. (3) On the morning of the 21st, hundreds of Japanese troops in Hefei, with many cannons attached, invaded Shilipu to the north, and were met by a certain Chinese unit in coordination with local armed forces, and encircled and fought fiercely until Weishi, after the Japanese army increased reinforcements, they broke through and escaped. The Japanese army also suffered many losses in this battle. (Telegram, 30th)</p>

The captains Yan Sihe and Xu Mingyuan were extremely indignant. On the 24th, taking advantage of the Chinese army's attack, they suddenly led more than 300 troops to rebel, attacking the rear of the Japanese army. All the Japanese troops were annihilated by the Chinese army, and the machinery for Japanese coal production in the mine, worth 2 million yuan for 80 tons, was completely destroyed. In this battle, more than 180 Japanese troops, including Lieutenant Tanaka, were killed, and many ammunition, military supplies, and documents were seized. The mine police force has now been incorporated into the Chinese army and is awaiting orders to kill the enemy. (Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Germany and the Soviet Union yesterday signed a border demarcation treaty, redrawing the boundaries of the areas occupied by both sides in Poland. There were many revisions to the provisional boundaries delineated by both sides on the 22nd of this month. The cities of Siedlce and Lublin, southeast of Warsaw, which had originally been ceded to the Soviet Union, are now assigned to Germany. The town of Praga (east bank of the Vistula River), near Warsaw, will also no longer see Soviet troops. All areas purely inhabited by Poles have been placed under German rule. Even the area near the town of Suwałki, between Lithuania and East Prussia in Germany, has been assigned to Germany. What the Soviet Union has gained are areas inhabited by Ukrainians and Little Russians. It appears the new boundaries largely conform to ethnic distribution. As for the city of Vilnius in northern Poland, an important railway hub, although currently owned by the Soviet Union, it is highly likely it will be returned to Lithuania. In addition, cities such as Grodno, Białystok, Brest-Litovsk, Lviv, and Przemyśl have all been assigned to the Soviet Union. In terms of economic benefits, except for the textile and sugar industries of Lviv and the oil region in eastern Galicia, most of Poland's industrial centers have been included within German territory. (Havas Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the agreement signed by Germany and the Soviet Union in Moscow yesterday, 80% of Poland's oil wells are owned by the Soviet Union, and Lviv, the largest city in southeastern Poland, and the area bordering Romania and Hungary, have also been assigned to Soviet territory. In addition to Lublin, Germany occupies Siedlce and Biała Podlaska east of the Vistula River. Current attention is focused on the provision in the German-Soviet agreement for exchanging Soviet raw materials for German manufactured goods, and the question of how this will affect the war. Transporting large quantities of raw materials across a long distance of land via the Soviet Union is a difficult problem. In addition, there is another difficulty, which is the Soviet Union's own domestic needs, the most obvious being the supply of oil. Although Soviet oil production has increased in the past eight years, it has all been absorbed by domestic demand. Apart from these practical considerations, some people also hold the opinion that the Soviet Union expects this decisive battle to result in a German revolution, so that the Soviet Union can turn it into a communist country. Therefore, does the Soviet Union want Germany to collapse sooner, or provide some assistance to Germany to prolong the war and make the situation worse, so that it can profit from it? This is the question. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>The much-publicized charity tennis tournament kicked off yesterday afternoon at the Shanghai Tennis Club on Avenue Joffre, with a large gathering of elegant ladies, making it a grand occasion. Including the handicap Group A final, a total of matches were showcased. Li Guofan defeated Zhang Dingzhao two sets to zero, winning the Lido Cup. Xu Chengwei and Wang Wenzheng each won one set. In the McCall singles, Tao Maonv defeated Wang Miaosong to win the finals spot. The event will continue today from 1:30 PM, with an even more exciting program. Yesterday's tickets are still valid. The results of yesterday's matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Ribbon-Cutting and Opening Serve</p>
<p>The handicap Group A singles final between Li Guofan and Zhang Dingzhao started first. Li's tennis skills have improved rapidly, and he won the championship two sets to zero. The Lido Cup was presented by Gao Huai'de, president of the Lido Sports Association, to be held for one year. Then, Madam Fan Xiangwen, wife of Qiu Maolin, cut the ribbon. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Secretary-General of the Refugee Association, delivered a speech, and Dr. Shi Zhaoji, former ambassador to the United States, served the opening ball. The ceremony was grand, and the charity tennis tournament was declared open.</p>
<p>Auction of Velvet Balls</p>
<p>During the break, three tennis balls used in the match were auctioned off, presided over by Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mrs. Bu Lisheng. Various philanthropists competed to donate generously. Mr. Chen Qihao opened with a price of 100 yuan. Mr. Bu Lisheng, Pan Zhiquan, Chen Kui, and Qiu Maolin competed in the bidding, and finally Mr. Qiu Maolin purchased them for 450 yuan. The total ticket revenue, in addition to the 2,599 yuan in advance sales, was another 114 yuan sold at the entrance yesterday (including five 5-yuan tickets, sixteen 3-yuan tickets, and forty-one 1-yuan tickets). The balls used in today's matches will also be auctioned off. It is expected that the revenue for the two days will exceed 3,500 yuan, greatly benefiting the distressed compatriots. The auctioned balls will be accompanied by a brocade box provided by the Refugee Association, and signed by Mr. Yu and Yuan, and Qiu to commemorate the event.</p>
<p>Performance Highlights</p>
<p>In the handicap Group A final, Li Guofan defeated Zhang Dingzhao at level scores, 6-2, 7-5, winning two sets in a row. Only the second set was slightly competitive. Li's tennis skills have improved significantly in recent years. His serve and forehand are both excellent, definitely better than Zhang Dingzhao. If Li could have utilized net play in the second set, victory would have been easier. The McCall singles semi-final between Tao Maonv and Wang Miaosong was entirely a performance of baseline long shots and power. The only drawback of McCall's tennis is the lack of variety. Besides groundstrokes, there were no overheads, smashes, or net play. Both players' forehand and backhand groundstrokes were extremely proficient. Tao had several angled shots that were rarely seen. Her skills were much better than Wang's. Wang Miaosong's footwork was messy and she tried to go to the net many times, but she couldn't smash, and ultimately failed. Xu Chengwei's tennis skills are completely different from when he participated in the National Games, enough to overwhelm Wang Wenzheng. His forehand and backhand groundstrokes are both excellent, his forehand bearing much resemblance to his elder brother's style. It is a pity that he still lacks stability. His serve is still not reliable. Li Guofan and he are the most promising young people. Wang Wenzheng seems to have reached his peak and it is difficult for him to excel further. The final doubles match was unremarkable, merely a performance.</p>

<p>In this year's grass tennis men's doubles final, Li Guofan and Tang Baojia met Carson and Squiers yesterday at the grass court, competing extremely fiercely.

<h3 id="e40">Finance: Hong Kong Banks Take Advantage of Low Prices to Buy, Cash Gold Rises Sharply After Falling, Settlement at Foreign Exchange Rates Gradually Tightening <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market situation of cash gold showed initial weakness due to easing foreign exchange rates. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rates returned to normal and Hong Kong banks showed strong buying interest, there was a strong rebound. As a result, although foreign exchange rates balanced out, the price of gold soared by 80 yuan. As a result, settlement at foreign exchange rates tightened slightly. The settlement price for British gold was 4,598 yuan, and the settlement price for US dollars was 4,710 yuan. The trend yesterday was that the morning opening was slightly weak due to loose foreign exchange rates, and the price was pushed down slightly to 4,000 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm and securities firms began selling, and the price retreated to a low of 3,990 yuan twice. As foreign exchange rates suddenly softened, it stimulated buying interest, and some money exchange businesses and securities firms rushed to buy. In addition, a certain silver building also turned from selling to buying. Soon after, Hong Kong banks also came to buy aggressively, so the price soared, once reaching a high of 4,105 yuan. However, the afternoon close was 4,100 yuan. In the afternoon, because there was no market on Saturday, the preliminary meeting outside the market reached 4,080 yuan. Later, Hong Kong banks had strong demand, and the price rose to 4,100 yuan again. Trading in the first half of the day was still active, at 1,400 to 1,500 taels. The price of silver building ornaments increased by 10 yuan. Customs gold and other prices remained stable.</p>
<p>Gold Rises 80 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the initial opening price per bar (10 taels) was weak due to loose foreign exchange rates and a certain gold firm having a strong desire to sell. The market was sluggish from the opening, and the price was lowered by 20 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded 30 taels, calling for 4,000 yuan. After the opening, the gold firm sold 10 taels to the money exchange business at 3,990 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange business suddenly bought over 100 taels on behalf of a customer, and the sellers took the opportunity to raise the price, so the price increased by 25 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 10 taels each from the securities firms and silver building firms at 4,015 yuan. After this, the gold firm started selling again, and the securities firms also came to sell, coupled with customers temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the price could not support itself and fell again, retreating into the 4,000 yuan range. A certain Yu firm sold 10 taels to the silver building firm at 3,990 yuan. Soon after, foreign exchange rates softened, and another securities firm suddenly showed buying interest. In addition, a certain money exchange business aggressively bought on behalf of Hong Kong banks, coupled with a shortage of sellers, so the price soared, rising sharply by 80 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded 30 taels at 4,070 yuan. At this time, market sentiment was very enthusiastic. Unexpectedly, the gold firm and cash gold firm took the opportunity to sell at a high price, which caused retail investors to sell. At that time, customers also turned sluggish, and the price soon fell by 30 yuan. Money exchange businesses sold 10 taels to the silver building firm at 4,040 yuan. Near noon, it was heard that foreign exchange rates continued to soften, and Hong Kong banks' buying interest was rekindled, so they bought over 500 taels aggressively, and the market became strong again, soaring by 65 yuan. Money exchange businesses bought 10 taels from the gold firm at 4,105 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms sold 20 taels to the cash gold firm at 4,100 yuan as the afternoon closing price. As a result, the price rebounded by 80 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 115 yuan in the first half of the day. The selling price of the cash gold firm's own brand of gold was 10 yuan higher than the refined gold price, and the purchase price was reduced by slightly over 30 yuan. The current margin gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Increases 10 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the selling price of silver building ornaments was still 405 yuan per tael. At 10:20, the price increased by 5 yuan, and at noon it increased by another 5 yuan. After that, there was no change. As a result, the selling price of Da Tong Heng was changed to 415 yuan. The new industry had the same price as the previous price, and the purchase price must be reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Cash Supply is High, Discount Rate Returns to 5 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and notes initially rose to about 90 yuan per thousand yuan. Later, the supply of cash exceeded demand, and the price quickly decreased, reaching about 80 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it fell to 77.5 yuan, resulting in a drop of 5 yuan. The interest rate for money industry associations was 20 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<p>US Silver Falls Slowly, US-Indian Silver Prices Weaken</p>
<p>London, 29th. Silver market speculators first sold and then bought, and the market was sluggish. The closing price was still flat, and trading was sparse. The spread between near and far term silver narrowed by 0.125 pence. New York Silver News: US spot price decreased by 0.025. Also, Bombay Silver News: The Indian silver market is unstable. Spot and October prices narrowed by 1 rupee and 9 annas, while November decreased by 1 rupee and 10 annas. A total of 100 orders were transacted.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Foreign Exchange Has Scattered Settlements <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market was like yesterday, and the HSBC listed prices did not change. The opening price of the black market for British and American currencies was slightly softer, with British gold at 4 shillings, 4.2875 pence, and US dollars at 7.40625 yuan. Later, speculators came to liquidate their long positions in September, and foreign banks, such as Li Mou Bank, also had a strong desire to sell, which caused the potential trend to loosen. The most expensive price for British gold that the bank bought was 4 shillings and 5.625 pence, and the cheapest price for US dollars that the bank sold was 7.5625 yuan. Then, foreign firms took the opportunity to settle transactions one after another, and Chinese banks also came to buy, and speculators' desire to sell had subsided. As a result, the market turned soft again. The most expensive price for British gold was 4 shillings and 4.0625 pence, and the softest price for US dollars was 7.375 yuan. However, the afternoon closing price was 4 shillings and 4.375 pence and 7.4375 yuan, respectively, with no change compared to yesterday. It was heard that the situation after the closing was slightly soft, with British gold at 4 shillings and 4.0625 pence, and US dollars at 7.40625 yuan. The trend in October was the same as in the spot market. Trading in the first half of the day was still active.</p>
<p>The gradual return to flat after loosening</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London silver price for near and far terms decreased by 0.5 pence, and the New York silver price decreased by 0.025. The price of London bullion remained stable. The exchange rates for British pounds vs. US dollars, vs. Shanghai, and vs. France were all flat. The US dollar fell by 0.0625 vs. the British pound, increased by 0.5 vs. Shanghai, and decreased by 0.025 vs. France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The morning opening selling prices of the banks' spot currencies were British gold at 4 shillings and 4.21875 pence, and US dollars at 7.40625 yuan, which was slightly higher than the previous close by 0.015625 pence for the British pound and slightly lower by 0.03125 yuan for the US dollar. After the opening, most of the speculators who were not strong in September tended to liquidate their positions, and foreign banks, such as Li Mou Bank, often came to sell. Although foreign firms came to settle transactions, the amounts were small, so the trend loosened. It was reported that Chinese merchants and Li Mou Bank sold spot British gold to HSBC and other foreign banks and a certain foreign firm for prices ranging from 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence to 4 shillings and 5.3125 pence. Also, the price of spot US dollars ranged from 7.4375 yuan to 7.5625 yuan. When HSBC's listed prices were announced and remained unchanged, and the balance tax on silver was announced to have decreased by 2.75, Li Mou Bank sold spot US dollars to the foreign firm for 7.5625 yuan. At 10:00, the desire of Chinese merchants to sell had subsided, and Chinese banks came to buy, so the situation gradually returned to flat. It was reported that Chinese banks bought spot British gold from foreign banks for 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence and 4.375 pence and spot US dollars for 7.5 yuan and 4.375 yuan. Near noon, the most expensive price for British gold was over 4 shillings and 4.0625 pence, and the asking price for US dollars was 7.375 yuan, but soon the prices returned to flat. Extending to the closing time, the selling prices of spot currencies of the banks were British gold at 4 shillings and 4.375 pence and US dollars at 7.4375 yuan. The prices for October were 4 shillings and 2.8125 pence and 7.125 yuan for US dollars. As a result, there was no change in the current prices of British and American currencies compared to the previous day. It was heard that the situation after the closing was slightly soft, with the selling price of British gold at 4 shillings and 4.0625 pence and US dollars at 7.375 yuan. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Securities: Domestic Bonds Wavering, Foreign Stocks Showing Slight Gloom <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Securities Grey Market: Yesterday's market conditions saw a slight easing of sentiment due to the U.S. President's statement, leading to price stability. Trading activity was thin yesterday, with prices showing a wavering pattern. Generally, the morning was slightly weak, while the afternoon saw some strengthening. On the buying side, Sheng Da Yuan Yu made some purchases in the morning, but Yong Yong Kang and retail investors mostly sold, creating a slight oversupply. In the afternoon, the No. 11, Da Feng, Lian He, and Jin Wei shares were relatively strong, with Class C shares briefly exceeding six yuan. Overall, most shares improved slightly by two or three cents, while Class D and E shares declined slightly by five to ten cents. The total transaction volume amounted to approximately six to seven hundred thousand yuan. A summary table is provided below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Fifty shares of the Cotton Yarn Exchange were traded at a price of 38.75 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Public Brokers Association reported that yesterday's stock market was slightly gloomy, with general prices trending slightly downward and trading activity being thin. Sellers did not experience any pressure, likely because it was the end of the month and operators were focusing on closing their accounts.</p>
<p>London, 29th: Today's listed prices for Far East British company stocks were generally stable, with only the Mercantile Bank shares rising by two shillings and sixpence to a price of six pounds, seven shillings, and sixpence.</p>
<p>London, 29th: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds still included the four types denominated in French francs and U.S. dollars, with stable prices and no changes.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Cotton Yarn: Sluggish Sales, Leading to Increasing Bearishness <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The bearish sentiment in the cotton yarn market is gradually increasing, with widening fluctuations. This is due to the sluggishness of actual transactions. Demand for fine yarn has decreased significantly in South China, preventing the market from stabilizing and causing it to trend downward. However, procurement of 10-count coarse yarn has continued, but the market has not been immune to the weakness of fine yarn sales. Coupled with rampant rumors of peace, weakening market sentiment has also been drawn into the whirlpool. Nevertheless, the foundation of raw cotton prices remains firm, and bulls remain calm, showing no signs of panic.</p>
<p>The opening of the yarn market this morning saw industry players refraining from action. General brokers only began shouting prices around 9:50 AM, but with a lack of actual transactions, the opening price immediately fell by seven or eight yuan. The spot price for "Double Horse" yarn was 765 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 730 yuan. Soon after, rumors spread, leading to a further drop of ten yuan, with the spot price reaching 758 yuan and the warehouse receipt price at 722 yuan. Subsequently, bargain hunters entered the market, causing prices to rebound by ten yuan. A half-day transaction volume of 767 bales was recorded. "Double Horse" yarn fell by 15 yuan, "Double Globe" by 16 yuan, "Tian Nu" by 10 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn also fell by 5 to 10 yuan. Today, 60 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Haiphong and 41 pieces to Hong Kong. The purchase volume of each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Same Trade: 555 Hong Kong: 110</p>
<p>Inland: 102 Statistics: 767</p>
<h3 id="e45">Interrupted Cotton Flower Arrivals, Prices Rise Again by Three to Four Yuan <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading has become quieter, likely due to the recent fatigue and slight recovery in yarn prices, leading to a weakening of mill buying interest, coupled with various peace rumors causing increased uncertainty. Consequently, trading activity has significantly decreased. However, selling prices remain firm due to the interrupted arrival of goods from various sources. No Tong cotton has arrived from Northern Jiangsu, with only 1,120 bales of North Sha cotton arriving. Given the low inventory levels, price declines are unlikely, leading to Tongzhou cotton prices rising again by three to four yuan to 160 yuan. Trading among industry players remains active, with 240 bales exported to Hong Kong. The spot cotton sales situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Hui Si Deng: 171.50 Industry Trade Purchases: 600 pieces Cash Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Xia Sha Hua: 161.00 Xin Sheng Mill Purchases: 176 bales Cash Factory Delivery</p>
<p>Xin Te: 135.00 Industry Trade Purchases: 250 pieces Cash Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Tongzhou: 160.00 Industry Trade Purchases: 200 bales Cash Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Another report indicates that yesterday's trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai was also particularly favorable due to relatively loose immediate exchange rates. Consequently, many industry players with looser credit took advantage of the opportunity to purchase goods. Compared to October futures, each dan could be purchased for six to seven yuan less. There were no large-scale bookings of American cotton, only sporadic transactions, possibly due to mills being affected by various rumors in the market.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices were slightly weaker in early trading in New York, with prices falling by five to six points. Prices were further weakened due to short selling in the South. Subsequently, rumors spread that the government would provide cotton loans for this year's new cotton crop at a rate of 3.375%, causing market prices to suddenly improve. As a result, prices rose by five to six points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton futures fell by seven rupees, Liverpool was particularly quiet, and Egyptian cotton rose by over ten points.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Grain: Recycled Flour Enters the Seven Yuan Range <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: The flour market was quite sluggish yesterday due to the weekend and the end of the month. The flow of customers from both North and South was notably average. Retail transactions were also affected by the gradual decrease in demand after the holidays. Additionally, warehouses with recycled goods were under pressure from mill rents and calls for delivery, leading floating holders to consider selling, resulting in a decline in the market. Yesterday's end-of-month survey showed a total flour inventory in Shanghai of over 2 million bags and a wheat inventory of over 500,000 bags. Mills were still holding firm at the original price of seven yuan and were unwilling to compromise, while recycled goods had already fallen into the seven yuan range. The lowest price was only 6.89 yuan, a decrease of five to ten cents compared to the previous day. Furthermore, 46,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin today, and 1,800 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market was stable before weakening. Following continuous purchases by mills and high production prices, the market was briefly brisk. However, mills adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the flour market suffered a downturn, causing the situation to deteriorate. As a result, high-quality wheat lacked trading volume, and medium-quality wheat generally weakened. Kunshan wheat sold for 9.93 yuan, Taicang wheat for 9.91 to 9.97 yuan, Changzhou wheat for 9.70 yuan. The Fu and Fu mills only purchased over 1,000 bags, and warehouses took in four to five truckloads.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Japonica Rice Remains Firm, Indica Rice Falls, Attracting Out-of-Town Sales <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Tu Rice: No goods have arrived from He Xia, and besides Wuhu and other areas being under some form of control, most of the goods are shipped to the Hongkou area, with only three to four thousand bags of new goods arriving in Kunshan, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Fengjing, and other areas. Since each top grade fell sharply yesterday, market prices seem to be low. Therefore, general rice merchants, considering their capital costs, are mostly unwilling to easily sell. However, since sales in this street are weak and rural distribution is limited, trading is at a standstill, resulting in stable prices for each top grade. Japonica rice has a small volume in the market, so although sales are weak, it becomes a rare commodity as soon as inquiries are made. Therefore, the situation is still quite firm. Regular japonica rice sells for 42 to 43 yuan, medium for 40 yuan, Wuxi special japonica rice for 42 yuan, high for 41 yuan, medium for 40 yuan, Suzhou and Kun japonica rice for 40 yuan, new japonica rice for 37 to 38 yuan. 20 dan of recycled early and late rice from He Xia sold for 37 yuan, original bags for 40 yuan, Jia Kun Fengjing and other new Yang Top Grade 26 yuan, market 25.5 yuan, second grade 24.5 yuan, Lu Top Grade 26 yuan, market 25.5 to 25 yuan, Variety Yuan 33 to 34 yuan, and the total market volume was only 4,200 to 4,300 bags.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Rice: Yesterday, over 4,000 bags continued to arrive from various routes, but after the market price fell, it attracted inquiries from inland merchants yesterday, and the sellers' attitude became firm, with asking prices immediately rising by three to five cents. The total market shipped 3,500 bags to the interior, and 2,000 bags to this street, high Ke Xian rice around 24 yuan, medium and second grades varied, while brown rice was only 20 yuan and 19 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Miscellaneous Grains: Sesame Rises Again, Beans Turn Weak <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Miscellaneous Grain Market: New sesame is experiencing limited and obstructed sources, resulting in few arrivals, creating a potential for speculation, and prices have risen repeatedly. Yesterday, the Yangzhou white sesame rose from 26.5 yuan to 26.9 yuan, with a total of over 140 bags sold, all purchased by this street. Most beans have softened, as distribution to various regions has become sluggish, and the trend is still wavering. Yesterday, 340 bags of yellow beans were traded, 160 bags of green beans, 236 bags of broad beans, and 30 bags of Chongming corn.</p>
<p>Six thousand bags of beans were shipped to Tianjin today, 1,160 bags to Hong Kong, 1,500 bags of raw peanuts to Hong Kong, and 500 bags of corn to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Declines, Xinghua Brown Sugar Expected Next Week <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market remained weak. The association marked the spot price of #24 coarse white sugar down by 5 cents to 54.5 yuan. Transshipment goods remained at 42 yuan. Taikoo Car White declined by half a yuan, B Mark 58.2 yuan, CW Mark 58 yuan, CX Mark 57.5 yuan, DY Mark 57 yuan, HX Mark 56.5 yuan, H Mark brown sugar remained at 43.2 yuan, Dutch brown sugar decreased by 2 or 3 cents to 44.2 to 44.3 yuan, transshipment remained at 37 yuan. Local Mian White decreased by 5 cents, Zhen Ji #1 55.2 yuan, #2 55 yuan, #3 54.5 yuan, #4 54 yuan. Local rock sugar increased by half a yuan, #1 67 yuan, Jing Ming rock sugar 68.5 yuan. It is heard that a whole batch of domestic Xinghua brown and white sugar is expected to arrive next week, so merchants' interest remains weak, and a proper market will only form depending on the arrival quantity. However, it is said that the water cost will increase fourfold. On the 27th, 9,000 bags of sugar arrived from Holland.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Piece Goods: Month-End Expiring Goods Dumped at Reduced Prices <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's cloth market continued to be brisk in spot sales, and mills' opening prices for next month's goods were higher than current market prices, stabilizing sentiment. Yesterday was the end of the month, and deliveries of expiring goods were very busy. Some warehouse holders sold their profits, and due to tight credit, hand goods were released at prices one to two and a half cents lower than the market price, causing some confusion in the market. However, with enthusiastic buyers, the overall market stabilized. In the later market, with continued brisk demand from this street and the clearing of hand goods, the market price rose by one or two cents. This street traded over 800 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, greige, and bleached and dyed cloth.

Recently, communication has been restored in many ways, and shipping has also resumed, with a continuous source of supply, but the water cost has been slightly increased to 9 shillings per ton. A large number of orders arrived from Yitai Xing again the other day. In the market, industry players dismantled the price at 106 yuan per ton.

<h3 id="e55">The Pseudo-Municipal Government Attempts to Collect Housing Tax, Residents of Western Shanghai Refuse En Masse; Post on Dunxin Road Again Occupied; Over 300 Pseudo-Police Deployed; Trend of Relocation Intensifies <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The situation in the area of ​​road construction beyond the boundary in Western Shanghai has become tense since the invasion and occupation of posts by pseudo-police. According to investigations, the total number of pseudo-police in the out-of-bounds area has reached 300, dispatched by the pseudo- "Police Brigade" of Fahua Town. Pseudo-patrol cars are also conducting armed patrols outside the boundary. The pseudo- "Finance Bureau" has set today to collect the winter housing tax. The general residents are determined to unite and resist. The Settlement Administration is determined not to give up police power there. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Dunxin Road Post Again Occupied</p>
<p>In the area of ​​road construction beyond the boundary, the activities of pseudo-police have become active again recently. Four pseudo-police officers suddenly deployed at the intersection of Dunxin Road on Daxi Road the other day. Starting yesterday, the pseudo-police occupied the post there and engaged in traffic management. The original patrol officers were forced to retreat to the sidewalk. At the intersection of Columbia Road on Daxi Road, the pseudo-police and patrol officers still maintain double posts and an uncooperative attitude. When the patrol officers direct north-south traffic, the pseudo-police release east-west traffic, making it extremely difficult for vehicles traveling there.</p>
<p>Residents Disgusted, Relocation Increases</p>
<p>The number of pseudo-police in the Caobao area has decreased since yesterday. In addition to guarding the original posts to direct traffic, pseudo-patrol teams rarely travel there. The surface is still calm. In the area of ​​Jessfield Road, Yu Yuan Road and Haig Road, the number of Japanese military police and pseudo-police has obviously increased sharply. Their traces can be seen everywhere. Transportation trucks and motor bicycles are constantly on the road. Residents are terrified when they see it. They feel deeply troubled. The trend of moving and closing the market is spreading more and more widely, and the air is very tense. However, the pseudo-party is eager to make money. It is heard that the pseudo- "Finance Bureau" has sent personnel to investigate the household registration of each neighborhood and notified that the winter housing tax will be collected starting today.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Police on Post Reach 300</p>
<p>After being instigated by a certain party, the pseudo- "Municipal Government" implemented the invasion and deployment of posts in the area of ​​road construction beyond the boundary in Western Shanghai. All the intersections west of Jing'an Temple, including Daxi Road, Yidingpan Road, Haig Road, Pingyuan Road, Difeng Road, Anhe Temple Road, Jessfield Road, etc., have pseudo-police traces. In addition to occupying the posts of patrol officers in the concession, there are also three or four armed pseudo-police officers with guns standing on the sidewalks around the area. According to reliable sources, these pseudo-police officers belong to the pseudo- "Police Brigade", and the team headquarters is located in Fahua Town. Every morning, patrol cars transport the pseudo-police to various posts and work in shifts of three hours. After "work", they are also transported back by patrol cars. The number of people currently invading the cross-border area has reached about 300. At the same time, there are patrol cars (commercial trucks) carrying several pseudo-police officers with machine guns patrolling everywhere, so the situation is obviously tense, and residents feel uneasy.</p>
<p>The Pseudo-Party Even Plans to Collect Donations Today</p>
<p>The pseudo- "Municipal Government" has recently been in dire financial straits because the "Reformed Government" stopped paying subsidies, so it coveted the collection of housing donations in the area of ​​road construction beyond the boundary to save the declining situation. After the pseudo-police invaded and occupied the posts, the pseudo- "Finance Bureau" immediately sent personnel to various neighborhoods to investigate household registration and set up a "Shanghai West District Tax Collection Office" to handle tax collection matters. It is learned that the pseudo-party will start collecting winter housing donations from shops and residents in various stores and households starting from (the 1st).</p>
<p>Shops and Residents Unite to Resist</p>
<p>Shops and residents in Western Shanghai expressed their indignation at the forced collection of housing donations by the pseudo-party. According to general reports yesterday, since the invasion of the pseudo-police, residents have been panicked and many have moved to avoid them, resulting in a sudden downturn in the market. Now the pseudo-party is intensifying its efforts to forcibly collect housing donations. Most shops and residents deeply understand the righteousness and will absolutely not cooperate with the pseudo-organization. If they want to collect donations, they will resolutely refuse and will unite to firmly resist. On the one hand, they still hope that the concession authorities will take effective measures</p>
<p>Robbers Rampant in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>On the west side of the cross-border road construction in Western Shanghai, after the westward shift of the war, the area did not suffer any losses due to the stationing of British troops, so the shops and homes were dense. Moreover, the factories that moved from the occupied areas all regarded this place as a Peach Blossom Spring to avoid Qin Dynasty, and it became a considerable factory area and bustling market. However, after the British troops left, there were suddenly dozens of gangs of bandits, some with a few people, some with more than ten people, and some with more than 20 people. The leaders arrested and extorted without doing any evil. In the past two months, it has been close to millions.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Rumors Abound, Exchange Market Boils, All of a Gambling Nature; Official Traders Absent, Excess Floating Capital and Speculation Abound <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, trade with China by all countries except the United States and the Soviet Union has been greatly affected, so Shanghai's foreign trade is extremely stagnant, and the traces of merchants in the exchange market are no longer visible. But today's exchange market is not lonely, but has a boiling phenomenon. Those who buy and sell in the exchange market today are all speculation experts. These people use the currencies of various countries as a gambling object to operate and profit, and have no other purpose in the exchange market. Therefore, speculators in the market arbitrarily spread rumors in order to make profits. The other day, after Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui spoke to the Associated Press reporter, the speculators created various peace atmospheres, resulting in a sharp decline in the black market for foreign exchange, a decline in the black market for gold, and a soaring grey market for securities. The main reason for the rampant speculation is the abundance of floating capital in Shanghai. To prevent speculation and manipulation of the market, the only way is to find a way to transfer the excess floating capital to the inland, and it can also assist the government in completing the construction of the southwest and developing the rich resources of the inland.</p>
<h3 id="e57">No Treaty Between Soviet Union and Japan; Peace Between Japan and Japan Awaits; Sino-Japanese War Has Not Reached a Decisive Stage; No One Can Say When It Will End; Important Remarks by Tsentsu <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post stated that Mr. Tsentsu, a Japanese director of the Municipal Council and director of the Japan Textile Industry Association in China, has now retired. The reporter met him this (30th) morning. According to him, he is 66 years old. He came to Shanghai in 1926 and has been here for 13 years. During this period, Shanghai has been greatly different from the past. It has developed rapidly in all aspects, and there have been so many events that have occurred in these 13 years that it is impossible to remember them all. As for the current world</p>
<p>Political Situation</p>
<p>He does not believe that Japan will sign a treaty with the Soviet Union. He reconsidered his opinion and still said that he did not believe that Japan and the Soviet Union would sign a treaty. Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, he believes that the war is still in an undecided stage, and it is too early to predict peace between the two countries. No one can say how long the Sino-Japanese War will last. However, if the war is prolonged, the Japanese must prepare to</p>
<p>Longer Support</p>
<p>Yun, Tsentsu remained silent on his activities in Shanghai, only saying that shortly after he became the director of the Japan Textile Industry Association in China, the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai. At that time, the Public Concession was disturbed by the fear of possible disputes for a long time. From the Japanese point of view, so-called anti-Japanese elements have caused several unfortunate incidents since then, leading to the Jinan Incident, until</p>
<p>The disaster a few days ago, according to Tsentsu, came from a farmer's family. He entered the diplomatic world in 1894 and served as the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin and Shanghai. He left his career in 1926 and came to Shanghai to serve as a director of the Japan Textile Industry Association in China and as a director of the Municipal Council for several years. He is scheduled to sail to Japan next Saturday and Sunday and return to his Tokyo residence to retire.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Principal and Interest of the Jinlong Public Bonds, Discounted Payment; Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank Issued Discount Certificates Yesterday <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee, after consulting with the Zhongzhong Jiaonong Called Bank, agreed that the four banks would discount and pay for various tariff-secured bonds. The twelfth principal and interest payment of the long-term financial public bonds of the Republic of China, totaling 1,532,812.5 yuan, were discounted and paid by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank starting yesterday. It is stipulated that the bank will issue "discount certificates" to be paid in six installments, with each installment being paid in one month, and the payment will be made with Shanghai's general exchange bills. As for the sixth resolution of principal and interest of the Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bonds of 1936 and the fifth resolution of principal and interest of the Guangdong Province Hong Kong River Project US Dollar Public Bonds of 1937, both due yesterday, the designated banks for payment of principal and interest made full payments. However, since these public bonds were issued in Guangdong Province, there is no payment agency in Shanghai. The sixteenth principal and interest payment of the 1935 Telecommunications Public Bonds was temporarily suspended due to the theft of the fund (international telegraphic fees).</p>
<h3 id="e59">Group Rice Purchase, Continued Registration; Once Rice Transportation Opens, Orders Will Be Placed Overseas <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the joint purchase of Saigon foreign rice by various groups in Shanghai, the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association was entrusted to handle the registration. Since the beginning, it has been nearly a month. A total of 101 groups, institutions, and major companies have registered by yesterday, totaling 15,718 bags. The registration method was previously stipulated that the price and shipping cost of Saigon foreign rice will be investigated and determined by the initiators. "When implementing the purchase, the purchaser should pay at least 50% of the price, and the rest will be paid according to the result of the settlement", and "the purchaser shall not cancel the amount they have ordered", and "the minimum purchase amount is 50 bags", etc. The Accountants Association has sent letters to various groups and institutions that have registered to order foreign rice. As soon as the transportation of Saigon rice is smooth, orders will be placed overseas, and a meeting of purchasers will be convened to discuss methods and elect custodians. The Certified Public Accountants Association is still continuing to process registrations, and a decision will be made soon.</p>
<h3 id="e60">British Women's Association Raises Funds to Knit Socks for the Troops <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao stated that the Shanghai British Women's Association will cooperate with the general plan of the central fund suggested by the British Joint Association to be established for wartime work and relief purposes when formulating plans within a considerable period of time. However, the British Women's Association's wartime work fund has already begun to be raised, and its nature is different from the general plan. British women in Shanghai have already started raising funds to purchase wool, knit socks for the troops and other purposes. Under the leadership of Chairman Mrs. Mosu, an appeal for donations has now been issued. Judging from the enthusiasm and patriotism of British women, it is expected that this move will be a great success and will show what work British individuals can do to reduce the burden on soldiers on the front line.</p>

<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 30th that Mrs. Gosmer, the wife of the French Ambassador to China, has now returned to France. Her return route is said to be by plane.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Coal Market Panic Gradually Subsiding <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The coal balls used daily by Shanghai citizens previously soared in price due to the skyrocketing price of coal dust, reaching a massive 80 yuan per ton in national currency. The retail prices of various coal shops were even more erratic, greatly affecting the lives of citizens. The other day, a large batch of Hongji No. 1 and No. 2 coal dust arrived in Shanghai, totaling no less than 20,000 tons, and the market price of coal balls fell by 4 yuan per ton. Yesterday, Mao Chunpu, a member of the Coal Industry Association, told a Dazhong News Agency reporter that traders hoarding large quantities of lump coal had to sell off their stockpiles due to tight money during the Mid-Autumn Festival. This has slightly alleviated the coal market panic that has gripped the city for several months. Statistics also show that over the past week, foreign coal arriving in Shanghai, in addition to the 1,000 tons of Indian lump coal that arrived on the 24th, has continued to arrive daily, totaling no less than 10,000 tons. According to the city's coal consumption, only about 5,000 tons are needed per month. In addition to the 10,000 tons of inventory from before, which is enough for two months, the arrivals this week are also enough for two months. Therefore, the supply of coal in Shanghai is no longer panicking, and coal prices will also fall in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Water Price Increase Due to Foreign Exchange Contraction Leading to Increased Expenses, Water Rates Increased by 50% <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Waterworks Company recently submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council for permission to increase water rates by an additional 50% to increase revenue and offset various losses. It is claimed that the company's operating expenses and the amount payable for dividends have greatly increased due to the contraction of foreign exchange. It is found that the company's budget for this year is based on an exchange rate of 3 shillings and 6 pence. Although various revenues have increased, the annual net profit that can be obtained is insufficient to offset the shortfall in dividends from the previous year, and after deducting the dividends for national currency preference shares, the remainder is insufficient to pay the ordinary share dividends payable under the company's business charter, resulting in a large difference.</p>
<p>Next Year's Budget Has Even More Deficit</p>
<p>Next year's budget is based on an exchange rate of 4 pence. Due to the increase in operating expenses, the deficit is large. In May of this year, the Waterworks Company once submitted a request to the Municipal Council for permission to increase prices. Later, due to the obvious improvement in business and in view of the extraordinary situation at the time, it expressed its willingness to extend the period for six months and consider the price increase issue again.</p>
<p>Price Increase Is Inevitable</p>
<p>In the past three months, the exchange rate of British gold has fallen from over 8 pence to 4 pence, so the company's budget must be greatly changed. As a result, the proposed price increase is inevitable. The company said that the proposed additional 50% water rate is the minimum necessary amount, otherwise the future safety of the business will be difficult to maintain. The above petition has been reviewed by the Chief of the Finance Department of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Chief of Finance Department Considers It Reasonable</p>
<p>The Chief of the Finance Department stated that the budget submitted by the Waterworks Company this time was compiled based on the actual business results of the first half of this year. The expenses listed in it have increased a lot due to the impact of the exchange rate. The company's proposed price increase is reasonable, so it is proposed to request the Council to allow it to add an additional 50% surcharge on bills ending on or after November 1 this year. However, this surcharge should be re-evaluated at any time before May 31 next year depending on the situation. The above suggestion has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Area A North of the Suzhou Creek to Register Households Soon, Residents Are Panicking, Many Are Moving, Extension of Deadline for Inoculations <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army took over the defense of Area A north of the Suzhou Creek, residents of the area have been in a state of unease. However, because it is not easy to move, they have to remain calm. In recent days, in addition to searching everywhere, the Japanese army has forced residents to be inoculated. Recently, there has been talk of registering residents, so the residents there feel even more panic. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Forced Inoculation Has Been Extended</p>
<p>The Japanese army has set up a Li Ren Hospital inoculation station at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, to the right of the Shanghai Telephone Company, forcing residents of the area to go for inoculation. The period was originally scheduled to end yesterday, but because there were so many people, it was impossible to popularize it for a while, so the inoculation date had to be extended to October 10. Also, due to the crowded conditions at the inoculation station, incidents of fake police whipping residents occurred from time to time. In order to maintain order, the patrol房方面 dispatched several Chinese patrolmen, one Indian patrolman, and one Japanese patrolman to the scene starting yesterday, using wire mesh to form a passageway so that those who were inoculated could enter in order, and the crowded situation began to ease.</p>
<p>Household Registration Causes Great Panic</p>
<p>Recently, when patrolling the various alleys, the Japanese army notified residents that residents living in the area must hold their inoculation certificates from tomorrow and report the number of people in their households. After the Japanese army verifies them, they will issue verification certificates to be posted on the doors before they are allowed to live there. Residents were greatly panicked when they suddenly heard this news. When the reporter went to the area for inspection yesterday afternoon, he saw movers carrying loads on vehicles and shoulders, one after another on North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road.</p>
<p>Receiving Permits Now Uses National Currency</p>
<p>The fake police in the Tianhou Palace, after being driven out by the British patrol team, were found again yesterday, and their number increased to no less than a dozen. They stood empty-handed at the permit filling station, checking those who went to collect permits. However, one thing is quite noteworthy, that is, those who went to collect permits originally had to pay in Huaxing banknotes, but now a notice has been posted to change to paying in national currency. In addition, at the Bazilu intersection at the end of North Henan Road, and at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, there are still British soldiers on guard. The barbed wire on the border road is still blocked. The barbed wire erected by the Japanese army from Jiangxi Road Bridge to Bazilu has not changed. The Japanese army posts are still at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Wenzhaisi Road, and at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road. Pedestrians to the east of the barbed wire must present their permits for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Temporary Shelters Added to First Refugee Camp <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The First Refugee Camp on Dunxin Road, affiliated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, recently expanded its scope and took in the completely helpless refugees from other refugee camps. The 19th Board of Directors meeting recently approved the rental of the open space in front of the gate and the construction of 195 temporary shelters, costing a total of more than 26,300 yuan. Construction has now begun and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The camp currently houses a total of more than 8,000 refugees. If the new houses are completed, it can accommodate another 5,500 helpless refugees. All recurring and construction costs are covered by the Association. In addition to the administration still being handled by the Association, the Salvation Army is responsible for all internal management responsibilities, so the camp's morality and order are stricter than before, and the results have also improved significantly.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Xinxiangtai Sails to Eastern Zhejiang, Original Ship Returns <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>After trying to transport goods to Eastern Zhejiang, three Japanese planes flew to harass the area on the 25th of last month, dropping five bombs near the碼頭, causing the British ship Casdimar and New Beijing to be affected by shrapnel, and the cabins were slightly damaged. They have sailed back to Shanghai to avoid the area and changed to other routes. Also, the British ship Xinxiangtai, represented by Taichangxiang, was intercepted by a Japanese warship when it arrived at the mouth of the river and was not allowed to enter. It is now learned that the ship has returned to its original port because it could not enter, arriving in Shanghai at 12:30 pm the day before yesterday. In addition, the Shenyou轮 of the British Yilong Company is still docked in Eastern Zhejiang. It is said that it plans to sail to Shanghai after loading, and will no longer sail to Wenzhou in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Industrial and Commercial Sectors Exchange New Fractional Currency Notes, Bank of China Adopts Gradual Issuance System, Tobacco Exchange Industry Requests to Receive More New Notes <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association accepted the entrustment of the Central Bank to receive fractional currency notes and distribute them to its members. The distribution has now been completed, and a public notice has been issued stating: "Notice: This time, our association has exchanged fractional currency notes, and all members have completed the exchange. All non-members are requested to exchange directly at the Central Bank. This notice is dated September 30, 28th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Bank of China Continues to Handle Exchanges for Various Industries</p>
<p>The Central Bank's new subsidiary coins of one fen and five fen began issuance procedures the day before yesterday. In addition to handling exchange procedures in advance for银钱业 banks, firms, and tobacco exchange merchants in order to circulate them on the market at any time and solve the difficulties of零我 for various industries, it also continued to handle the exchange of notes for various banks and industrial and commercial sectors yesterday. The needs of major factories for giving change for wages, as well as the零數 for the business of major companies and商號, were all supplied in moderation. The number of notes exchanged must not exceed 200 yuan at most. The needs of various菜塲 in Shanghai can be supplied by the sale of tobacco exchange stores, and the bank does not directly supply them. Secondly, if members of various industry associations need to exchange new notes, they can directly send a letter from each association to the bank for consideration. It is heard that the bank will continue to distribute new notes in the future until there are enough to circulate on the market. The difficulty of零找 in Shanghai has been resolved.</p>
<p>Tobacco Exchange Industry Asks to Receive More New Notes</p>
<p>According to Dagang News Agency, reporters learned from the tobacco exchange industry that the Bank of China only allowed the industry to exchange 40,000 yuan in new notes the day before yesterday. The exchange target is limited to tobacco exchange members, but the association has many members, and the total amount exchanged is not enough to distribute to members, which has caused members to criticize. The association authorities were forced to send Shen Peifan and others to the Bank of China to request an increase in the amount of exchange to meet the needs of members. It was agreed to consider it, but a reply must be given after a decision is made.</p>
<p>Seven People Injured in Exchange Fights</p>
<p>Since it was reported that the Bank of China entrusted the tobacco exchange association to distribute fractional currency notes to the industry, various sectors mistakenly believed that they could also exchange at the association, so they flocked to the association's meeting place on Ningbo Road to request exchange. The crowd was crowded and noisy. Fortunately, the Old Gate patrol房派探捕 maintained order, and no incidents occurred all day. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning,市民 still did not understand the truth and flocked to the association to ask for new notes, reaching 700 to 800 people. The association told them that the new notes had been used up and there were no notes to exchange. At that time, a member商號 of the tobacco exchange industry took out 200 yuan in new notes, and the exchangers immediately began to criticize and then fought each other. As a result, one person's head was broken and bleeding, seriously injured, and six others were slightly injured. The person in charge of the association explained and the matter was settled. It is said that the tobacco exchange market was affected by this and stopped trading for the past two days.</p>
<p>Collecting Tokens for Full Exchange</p>
<p>The issuance of fractional currency notes is based on the face value without discount. When it was originally issued, it was reported that unscrupulous people deliberately raised the value, exchanging each corner for only nine fen. After receiving the report, the Central Bank decided to notify the tobacco exchange industry association to correct it. Since yesterday, the market has unanimously refused to use miscellaneous token notes. At the same time, various companies such as Daxin and Sincere and the token notes issued by various industries have begun to be recalled and cancelled. As for the token notes issued by the tram company and the bus company in the two concession areas, because the quantity is huge and has penetrated into various industries, it is difficult to recall them for a while, so they are still circulating as usual. As for the hard nickel coins issued by the bus, it is not intended to be recalled, but it is limited to use on the bus.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Disaster Relief Needs Are Urgent, Appeal for Support, Continue to Collect Previously Pledged Donations, or Request to Raise Other Special Donations <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday sent a letter to various public organizations, industry associations, and clan associations, stating: "Greetings, at the previous annual general meeting of members, representatives of various organizations attended, and regarding the fundraising item, a unanimous resolution was made to 'continue to promote the fundraising method by extending the various donations recognized according to the original plan.' The minutes are recorded. Our association is organized by various organizations, and many of the organizations are those that have recognized various donations. The disaster relief funds of our association rely entirely on the regular donations paid by the organizations and the enthusiastic donations and enthusiastic support from all walks of life, which have been maintained for a year. We are grateful to the representatives for agreeing to extend all the donations recognized, so that our association's disaster relief work can continue to proceed in the future without interruption. All the refugees in the city are greatly grateful. The members of our association express their admiration. However, in recent months, prices have risen sharply, doubling from the past. The originally fixed food allowance for refugees was two yuan per person per month, but now it is five yuan per person per month, and it may have to be increased again in the future, which is difficult to predict. The number of people is difficult to reduce, and expenses have also increased sharply. Winter is approaching in a blink of an eye, and cold clothes must be added, and various post-disaster tasks must be actively prepared. The donations received are not enough. The refugee problem in the city has entered a severe stage. If we do not widely fundraise, there will be adverse consequences, and the impact will cause endless troubles. Since our association is responsible for disaster relief, we have to urgently appeal. We dare to send this letter to you, hoping that you will give your special support from beginning to end. In addition to continuing to collect the originally pledged donations, please consider increasing the originally recognized amount, or raise other special donations to provide assistance. If you have various fundraising methods, please give us your advice at any time, and we will send someone to contact you. This is specially announced, hoping you will take it into consideration."</p>

<p>The Zi Lin Bao said that British military officers stationed in Shanghai yesterday (29th) denied the Japanese newspaper's report that on Tuesday, a British patrol team attempted to expel two "municipal government" Chinese police officers from the Tianhou Palace building on North Henan Road that they occupied. According to the Japanese newspaper, a branch office of the "Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau" is now set up in the building to handle the issuance of permits, etc. to the Chinese. The British patrol team attempted to expel the two Chinese police officers from the building but failed, and then retreated. However, according to British military officials, the incident occurred because a British military patrol team was stationed on the sidewalk opposite the building and saw a "municipal government" police officer, so they detained him for investigation. After learning that he was a member of the police team in the Tianhou Palace building, he was released immediately.</p>

<p>Since the war of resistance, women in general war zones have fled to Shanghai one after another, and among the working women in Shanghai, there are even more who have become unemployed due to the impact of the war. Among them, it is even more difficult for women who have received primary and secondary education to find a way out. To seek their survival in Shanghai, where the current cost of living is high and everything is skyrocketing, their suffering cannot be described in words. The YWCA at 99 Jing'an Temple Road in this city, in view of this, has created a nanny training school to provide job opportunities for unemployed women. The first group of nanny graduates have all been introduced to families and institutions for service, which has been deeply praised by society. Therefore, the second session will be continued and is now starting to enroll students. The semester is tentatively set for five months, and the tuition fee is 20 yuan. Those from poor families can pay half first, and the other half can be paid after graduation. Recently, unemployed women have been crowding to register, so those who are interested can contact the association as soon as possible, which is good news for the unemployed.</p>

<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that the Shanghai Foreign Tenants' Association, initiated by foreigners in Shanghai, has now decided on the date of its founding meeting. There are two more lawsuits filed by Chinese landlords against the court. The British ambassador is currently investigating the excessive rent, and the French Concession authorities have also re-raised the order regarding rent increases. The movement of tenants opposing unreasonable rent increases took a definite step forward today (30th). The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>General Meeting to Be Convened in Mid-Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tenants' Congress, which was postponed a few weeks ago due to political relations at the request of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is now scheduled to be held at 5:00 pm on October 11 in the hall of the New Tian'an Church. Members and other tenants concerned about this matter can enter, but they must ask the person in charge to certify.</p>
<p>Tenants Oppose Rent Collection in Foreign Currency</p>
<p>Li, the landlord of the Riverside Park 公庽 (transliteration), was recently sued by a央籍 tenant for requesting to collect rent in US dollars. Li lost the lawsuit. It is now heard that another British tenant has sued Li and will be in court on the first day of the month. It is also heard that the Chinese landlord of Plunville Villa (transliteration), about a quarter of a mile east of Kaixuan Road, recently requested to collect rent in foreign currency. The tenants of the villa held a meeting last night (29th) and decided to sue the landlord.</p>
<p>British Ambassador Has Considered the Matter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tenants' Association sent a letter to the British Ambassador and has now received a reply, stating that the British Embassy is still considering protecting British僑 and opposing excessive rent. However, in view of the complexity of the situation, the Embassy's investigation has been slightly suspended, but it is expected that an announcement will be made soon.</p>
<p>Actively Seeking Members of Various Nationalities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tenants' Association is international in nature and believes that taking action on behalf of members of any nationality will indirectly assist other members, so it is currently actively seeking members of various nationalities. The association's organizing committee decided last night that the membership fee and annual fee are both ten yuan and agreed on various articles of association.</p>
<p>French Municipal Council Maintains Old Case</p>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council issued a notice today stating that a certain real estate company has issued a new rent plan to tenants in the French Concession without notifying the Municipal Council. The collection of房金微 and other matters must still be handled in accordance with the orders issued by the局方 in 1935 and 1937. The Municipal Council's notice may be due to a certain company collecting rent from tenants in all its公庽, intending to calculate水電 and other items separately from the "basic rent." The tenants of a certain公庽 are quite troubled by the news, because the "basic rent" currently demanded is itself higher than the previous total rent. The Shanghai Tenants' Association is also paying attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The女子银行 needs to renovate the Qingyuli on Chongqing Road, which led to a lawsuit with the tenants. As a result, the court ruled that the tenants should move out, and the execution procedure has been confirmed. However, more than 3,000 tenants in the里 cannot find a house to move into because it is a very special time, so they applied to the execution judge for a stay of execution on the 20th of the month when the eviction agreement was due, and stated that they had</p>

<p>Filed a retrial lawsuit with the Second Branch of the High Court. After the execution judge consulted with the representative of the plaintiff女子银行 and obtained his consent, the execution was suspended for several days. However, the女子银行 suddenly ordered workers to surround the里 with bamboo fences on the 22nd. At that time, the tenants believed that the court had not issued a mandatory execution order, and the女子银行 had rashly fenced, intending to demolish the houses, which was obstructing the exercise of rights. They also believed that once construction and demolition began, it would endanger the lives of the tenants, so for legitimate defense and</p>

<p>The five defendants jointly hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to defend them. patrol房 lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the process, sued them in accordance with Article 25 and Article 354 of the Criminal Law, and requested that they be sentenced according to law. Questioning Gu Jiren, he admitted that he was at the scene demolishing the houses and confessed that Ping Jinya and Qian Huafo instigated them. Jiang Jinkui and Chen Dongyang admitted that they demolished the fences, but it was a legitimate act of excluding infringement and denied that they were instigated by Ping and Qian. Ping Jinya and Qian Huafo denied instigating them and claimed that this act was an action by each tenant to protect their own power and</p>
<p>Exclude Illegal Damage, Why do they need us to instigate them? Lawyer Yuan declared that the Second Branch of the High Court had ruled that the execution of the eviction judgment was suspended, and the女子银行 had committed a mandatory demolition act before the court issued a mandatory execution order, endangering the safety and rights of others, so according to the law and precedents, the actions of the defendants could not be considered guilty, and he requested that they be found not guilty. After Judge Meng checked the confessions, he ordered the debate to be concluded and scheduled to announce the judgment next Monday.</p>

<p>Li Yongkuan, Li Jia Zhou, and Li Bi Hua, father and sons from Anhui Province, notorious bandits, formed a bandit gang in Songjiang during the retreat of the National Army in the winter of the previous year.

<h3 id="e87">October and Children <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Little Friends, This Is A Message You Must Not Ignore</p>
<p>Time truly flies. In the blink of an eye, today is the beginning of October. In terms of seasons, the solar October corresponds to the mid-autumn of the lunar calendar. The north wind is just beginning to rise, and the cold air is sharp. Everyone is changing from single-layer clothing to lined clothing, presenting a somber scene once again. On the streets and in the corners of buildings, many refugee children are wandering, crying from cold and hunger, trembling. Why are they in this state? Little friends who are enjoying happiness, please close your eyes and think about it.</p>
<p>In another eight days, everyone will be celebrating the National Day commemoration in the third year of the War of Resistance (which can also be said to be the nation's year of hardship). Looking back from the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang to October 10, 1911, when the revolutionary army revolted in Wuchang and the Republic of China was born, the course of hardship in between involved sacrificing countless martyrs' heads and spilling countless martyrs' hot blood. Many failures were overcome, but eventually, they wove together the brilliant flower of freedom for the Chinese nation, regaining the glory of the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>When the artillery fire resounded across the isolated island weeks ago, my children experienced for the first time the National Day amidst fireworks (anti-aircraft fire) and flying flesh and blood. The sounds of planes and cannons played a fervent and grand tragic song. The children were not only unafraid but also extraordinarily spirited and excited! I want to thank its bestowal, and I feel even more that the Isolated Island National Day in the first year of the War of Resistance is the most memorable and worth recalling. Little friends who once stood on the isolated island, experiencing an exciting National Day amidst intense artillery fire, probably still remember it very clearly, right?</p>
<p>The season tells us that it is October again. Great October, we must welcome it and encourage it. Millions of brave soldiers at the front are stepping on the bloodstained footprints of the martyrs, advancing one after another, tirelessly fighting for more than two years. "Failure is the mother of success." One day, we will weave together the brilliant flower of freedom for the Chinese nation once more, regaining the entire glory of the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Little friends, now is precisely the time for you to bury yourselves in your studies. Do not waste a single moment, do not relax for a single moment. The great word "October" is also the epitome of Jesus's universal love and aid to the masses. When you see homeless, wandering children on the streets and in the corners of buildings, you should know your own happiness and joy, and give them extra sympathy and assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Natural World in Autumn <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<p>After several heavy rains, the weather has become much cooler. People have, without prompting, put on lined clothing. The time tells us, "It is autumn."</p>
<p>In the autumn, what kind of changes do the sights of the natural world undergo?</p>
<p>In the mountains and fields, the grass is either withered or yellowed. In reality, they have already kept their rootstocks, underground stems, or seeds, quietly waiting for germination next spring. The insects are gradually decreasing because they have already laid their eggs, their mission is complete; therefore, they themselves have also died one by one. However, a small portion of mosquitoes and flies, etc., still remain in warm places, secretly passing through this harsh winter.</p>
<p>Those trees with thin leaves begin to gradually cut off the passages within the leaves because they fear that so many leaves exposed to the fierce north wind will cause the moisture inside the body to evaporate quickly. Soon, the leaves fall. The broken ends are tightly sealed with a layer of rubber, preventing moisture from secretly escaping. However, those trees with thick leaves and needle-like leaves do not need to do this because their leaves already have very perfect equipment, and even in the most fierce north wind, moisture will not escape very quickly.</p>
<p>The plane trees on the roadside will soon be left with only bare trunks and branches. As a result, the roads become much more open.</p>
<p>You should know that after the function of the leaves gradually ceases, the substances inside also undergo changes. Therefore, some turn into red leaves, and some turn into yellow leaves. People like to take these two kinds of discolored leaves as ornamental items.</p>
<p>The decrease in insects causes great panic among animals that live by eating insects. Therefore, the swallows begin to hold meetings, planning to fly south in groups on a clear morning. The bats, however, prepare to hibernate, waiting to wake up from their sleep when the insects breed again.</p>
<p>Is the natural world in this autumn so bleak? It is not.</p>
<p>Look, chrysanthemums are blooming in the garden, one clump here, another clump there. Geese are coming from the north. A flock flies across the sky. Also, beans and vegetables are being sown at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Rice Milling <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>— Ming'er's Refugee Diary, Part 36 —</p>
<p>To the west of Ming'er's third home was a mountain stream. The water flowed day and night, gurgling into the low-lying stream channel, flowing endlessly. Whether in drought, in rain, in spring, in summer, water was always sounding throughout the four seasons. However, the sound of the water was sometimes strong and sometimes weak, which was related to the amount of water. Especially in the middle of the night, the sound of the water played out exceptionally loudly, pouring into Ming'er's slumber, entangling him incessantly, and a sense of annoyance burned in his heart, but he could not suppress the piercing sound.</p>
<p>One day, Ming'er helped his mother carry the basket to the stream to wash clothes. The stream water was so clear that one could distinguish the pebbles at the bottom of the stream, but the water was never still for a moment. Where did the water flow to stop? This aroused his curiosity, so he lifted his feet and followed the direction of the water flow, walking on and on.</p>
<p>As Ming'er's footsteps moved, the stream gradually widened, and the speed of the water flow also increased. The pebbles on the bank of the stream, polished by the rushing water every day, had no edges or corners. Occasionally, one or two beautiful, shining kingfishers lingered on the smooth stone surface. In an instant, a rush of water came, driving them from their occupied position, washing away the marks on the stone surface, and shining roundly towards the sunlight again. Ming'er still moved forward.</p>
<p>A row of straw tied together, long and wide, lay across the center of the stream, hoarding the stream water from the upper reaches. The water accumulated more and more, constantly overflowing along the upper edge of the straw row. The water flow passed this difficult obstacle, becoming exceptionally rapid. What other purpose did the man-made dam have besides causing a huge rushing water sound? Ming'er walked forward without thinking. Before he could walk more than ten steps, he found another embankment, and the water was even more rapid. After a few dozen steps, there was another dam. The water barely escaped from these three difficult obstacles with its life. When the drainage flew straight down from the high dam, it hung down on the dam like a silver-white curtain of water. Moreover, due to the reflection of the sunlight, it was like a priceless pearl curtain, colorful and dazzling, radiating light in all directions. Such a spectacular sight was rare. Countless silver beads of foam splashed on the stones in the stream, emitting a mad roar. Round whirlpools swirled in the stream, flowing aimlessly.</p>
<p>A wooden house was built not far from the dam. Beside the house was a huge wooden wheel. The wheel blades were struck by the rushing water, lazily rotating. Moreover, there was a sound of hammering inside the wooden house. Ming'er could not help but break in.</p>
<p>It was a two-room wooden house, not very tall. Bags of grain were piled up inside. A stone mortar was embedded in the mud floor, filled with rice, waiting for the wooden cone installed in the axle to strike down. The squeaking axle seemed unwilling to be rotated by the water, but it was controlled and dared not move, so it could only emit a squeaking complaint. The wooden cone struck into the mortar with heroic force, and the rice was violently oppressed by it. Some had their husks stripped off, some were still resisting stubbornly, and some escaped the confines of the mortar. Sadly, they were caught and brought back in by the guard - the rice miller in the house - acting as an accomplice. The final result was that they could not escape the violent blow, and they revealed their original form naked: that was rice.</p>
<p>The sound of the cone hitting, the sound of the axle, and the sound of the water flow interwove into a piece of unstructured music, and the rice steam tightly sealed that wooden house. Ming'er could not stand the suffocating stimulation and retreated.</p>
<p>"Rice milling is like this!" He gained this brand new harvest again and returned home along the original road with a smile.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Function of Saliva <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Bin</p>
<p>Saliva is an indispensable substance for people. Although we often do not pay attention to its function.</p>
<p>Little friends! When saliva is mentioned, you will always think that whenever there is food in front of you, there is always more saliva in your mouth. If you are not careful, a few drops will drip out. Some little friends think this phenomenon is shameful, so they have to keep swallowing it. It is often discovered by others, but this is not shameful because saliva is extremely necessary when food enters the mouth, so it cannot help but secrete a lot before it enters the mouth.</p>
<p>The main function of saliva is of course to moisten the chewed food, mixing it with the food crumbs to make it easier to swallow. It is especially needed for dry foods such as roasted rice flour and biscuits. In addition, it also has a function of being able to digest starch. When we chew white rice carefully, we often feel a slight sweetness. This is the result of the starch in the rice being broken down into sugars (glucose) by saliva.</p>
<p>Saliva can also lubricate the mouth, allowing the tongue to move freely and making speech fluent. If you talk for too long, you will feel thirsty, and this is the reason.</p>
<p>The proverb says, "Saliva is medicine, useful everywhere." This is not an empty statement. For example, if you are accidentally bitten or stung by ants or bees, your skin will swell up. If you apply saliva to it, the redness and swelling will subside. This is because when bees and ants sting people, they send a kind of formic acid into the person's skin. Saliva then neutralizes the formic acid through its alkaline action.</p>
<p>Little friends! Think about it: isn't saliva very useful?</p>
<h3 id="e91">The Old Woman and the Servant <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>—Aesop's Fables—</p>
<p>There was a very good housekeeper old woman who would shout for her maidservant to get up every morning when the rooster crowed. The maidservants were all afraid of getting up early, so everyone discussed killing the poor rooster. They said, "If it weren't for the rooster waking up our mistress, she wouldn't come and wake us up." But that good woman, lost her clock (the rooster), would often get the time wrong, and would wake them up in the middle of the night. So they not only did not improve things, but it was even worse than before! (Zhao Yilin)</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Blue Dwarf (2) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>A Li replied: "What is there to be afraid of? Of course I'm not afraid." When she said this, she looked down on A Li's timidity somewhat. But A Li was really a very small child, only eight years old this year, while A Li was almost twelve years old. When she was eight years old, she was just like A Li, afraid at the slightest thing. Looking back now, she feels that there was no reason to be afraid. She still remembers that previously, her older cousins often ridiculed her timidity, intentionally talking about ghosts and monsters to scare her as a game. Even now, whenever it is dark and the lights are not on, she still feels a bit nervous and fearful when she is alone in the room. When A Li thought of this, she used a gentler tone to comfort her younger brother, saying, "Of course there is nothing to be afraid of at all. When I think of those blue dwarfs, I just feel that they are fun. A Li, you must know that in fact there are no such things as celestial beings, ghosts, or monsters."</p>
<p>A Li quickly said: "But there are always dwarfs. Wasn't that little old man just now clearly a dwarf?" A Li said: "Yes, dwarfs are dwarfs, but they cannot be classified as celestial beings, ghosts, or monsters. They are also humans, but they are just born a little shorter. Perhaps they fell very badly when they were young, which prevented them from growing taller and made them permanently short." A Li said: "Is that so? I didn't know that. I hope I haven't fallen too badly before, because many people say that I shouldn't be so short at my age." As he said this, he looked at his short and powerful legs with some worry.</p>
<p>A Li couldn't help but laugh loudly and said, "Hehe, A Li, you are really a funny child. This worry is unnecessary. You must know that you are definitely not a dwarf. You will grow stronger and taller year by year in the future." A Li put down his worries and returned to the question of the blue dwarf, slowly saying, "But I feel that this matter is a bit strange. You were just talking about the blue dwarf when a short old man walked down the street and passed in front of our window. A Li, didn't you see him look at us with a rather funny expression, as if he had heard our conversation?" Li said: "Actually, the people in this village look at us all like that. Perhaps their eyes see both of us as a bit funny. Like your sailor suit and my velvet hat, they are rarely seen, so they think they are strange, just as we feel that the village women's purple shirts and bright blue skirts are strange."</p>

<h3 id="e93">Xiong Foxi's "Sai Jinhua" <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Xitong</p>
<p>Xiong Foxi is one of the earlier and more established modern drama writers. I heard he was unhappy because his works were included in the "Popular Drama Series" by the Literary Research Society, thinking it was an undervaluation of him. In reality, being able to make works popular and acceptable to the masses is not an easy feat to achieve. Mr. Xiong might as well utilize his strengths in this area.</p>
<p>For example, his short play "The Artist," which depicts a painter pretending to be dead, almost resembles civilized drama or "farce." Furthermore, his "Sai Jinhua," which was performed at the Xuan Palace Theater, incorporated excerpts from Peking opera such as "The Drunken Concubine" and "Battle of Taiping," as well as the addition of Little Tiger, which added a lot of joyful and happy elements to the play. No wonder Lin Ke said to me, "This play is quite lively." Xu Xingzhi's "The True Story of Ah Q" also shows signs of heading in this direction. I am very happy and hope that more Guan Hanqings or Li Yus will emerge. Not everyone has to be Bai Pu or Tang Xianzu!</p>
<p>However, if viewed from the perspective of popular drama, "Sai Jinhua" seems to have a sense of being overly new. This is because the play not only has "flashbacks," where the characters talk about past events, but also "omissions." These omitted parts require the audience to use their minds to fill in. For example, the scene where Sai Jinhua meets Waldersee is explicitly written by Xia Yan, but Xiong Foxi uses an indirect approach. Sai Jinhua being wrongly imprisoned and the prostitute she bought committing suicide are also presented indirectly. These are things that audiences accustomed to civilized plays or movies with clear beginnings and endings are not used to. However, the many implications can attract attention, which reduces difficulties for the audience. Therefore, even civilized drama audiences can accept it with a little effort.</p>
<p>The tragic atmosphere of this play seems to be stronger than Xia Yan's work, although the basic tone is the same—helping others but being forgotten in return. Sai Jinhua is the Chinese "Ball of Fat" (Maupassant's novel). Xia Yan's work only considers leaving the brothel as the highest point of sorrow, while Xiong Foxi's work precedes it with imprisonment and follows it with the poverty and destitution of old age, which is extremely touching and almost unbearable to watch. Starting with drunkenness and ending with drunkenness, the entire play is integrated into one, showing considerable ingenuity.</p>
<p>Ru Hui's adaptation is commendable for its ending, which not only elevates Sai Jinhua's personality but, more importantly, reminds us not to forget reality.</p>
<h3 id="e94">"China" Two-Week Anniversary <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Xinying</p>
<p>The China Film Studio, abbreviated as "China," was established on October 1st, the 26th year of the Republic of China. Originally, it was under the film section of the Political Training Department of the Military Commission. After expanding its organization, it was renamed China Film Studio. Therefore, today marks the two-week anniversary of "China."</p>
<p>The main goal of expanding the film section of the Political Training Department into "China" was, of course, to produce wartime films. However, due to the repeated internal movements of the Chinese army, "China" moved from Nanjing to Hankou and then from Hankou to Chongqing. It is still engaged in film production in Chongqing today.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, some of the progressive film stars from Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places set off to the interior to take on the work of saving the nation through film and drama. At that time, "China" recruited many promising male and female film stars. However, the current treatment of film workers in "China" is very low. Even top-tier stars only earn around 60 yuan per month. Therefore, regardless of whether they are male or female stars, their lives in Chongqing are very simple and without the habits of film stars.</p>
<p>After "China" moved to Chongqing, it produced more than 20 dramatic films and documentaries in the past two years. Although these films could not be publicly screened in Shanghai due to special circumstances, they were screened in almost all the busier cities in the southwest. In Chongqing, the lack of film sources and the unsuitable weather conditions affected film production, sometimes even causing "China" to temporarily stop filming. Otherwise, I think "China's" output in the past two years would not have been limited to just over 20 films!</p>

<p>When Yu Lin was filming "Flying over Walls" in "The Adventures of Jianghu," playing Gan Lianzhu, she shouted, "Being suspended and pulled around with wires like this is simply treating life like a child's play!" But she doesn't know how imposing she will look on the screen as a "female knight-errant."</p>
<p>Recently, Lu Ming has been riding a bicycle on Route Petain every morning. Xu Qingfang strongly opposes this, but Chen Kengran absolutely agrees because Qingfang can't ride it, but Kengran can handle it (the bicycle wheel).</p>
<p>Nanjing actor Ye Dexi originally intended to go to Sichuan to join "China Electric" in Hong Kong, but later accepted Tang Huaiqiu's invitation to help "China Travel." Yesterday, he received a letter from Lin Jing of "China Travel" saying that Ye Dexi had died of illness in Hong Kong on the 28th of last month, and his funeral was very bleak!</p>
<p>Ying Yin recently wrote from Hong Kong, saying that she has arrived safely in Hong Kong and will set off for Shanghai within a few days. Miss Li Danlu, a film and drama personality from Hong Kong Island, will accompany her.</p>
<p>Tang Huaiqiu of "China Travel" wrote, saying that he was invited by a certain theater in Shanghai and will lead all the partners of China Travel back to Shanghai at the end of October. The actors include Lu Cuilan, Chen Ping, Gong Jiabao, and Hong Kong movie stars Zhang Ying, Wu Hui, and many others. The lineup far surpasses its heyday.</p>
<h3 id="e96">A Short Note on Wu Suqiu <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Ruochang</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu, a native of Penglai, Shandong, is the prospective daughter-in-law of General Wu Ziyu. At the age of thirteen, she entered the Chinese Opera School to study opera. She excelled and was the best female role performer in the entire school. After graduating, she became a student of Shang Xiaoyun, the master of Xinfang Studio, specializing in the Qingyi (young female roles). The plays she learned, such as "Sacrificing the Pagoda," "Sacrificing to the River," "Visiting the Palace," "Herding Sheep Mountain," and "Mother Meng Teaches Her Son," were all personally taught by Qi Xia. Later, she joined Xiao Liuzhao's school, also studying various Hua Dan (vivacious female roles) plays, such as "Yutangchun," "Flower Hairpin Error," "Thirteenth Sister," "Pan Qiaoyun," and "Pan Jinlian," all following Hui Sheng as a model. Ziqiu has a wide and bright voice, suitable for both strong and gentle tones. In strong passages, she is very much like Xiaoyun, and in gentle passages, she is like Huisheng. The beauty of her singing is the best since Xue Liu. Suqiu has brought a large number of private repertoire plays with her. "Peacock Flies Southeast" and "Peach Blossom Face" have been performed in Tianjin and Beijing to packed houses. "Peacock Flies Southeast" is a unique play of the Chinese Opera School. The best performances are by Wu Ziqiu and Zhao Jinrong. The entire play has many singing parts, with Xipi slow rhythm, two-six quick rhythm, and Nan Bangzi tunes. The premiere will be next Monday, and good ticket sales can be predicted. It is said that Zhao Jinrong and Suqiu are very close, and Zhao Jinrong has decided to let Suqiu shine alone in this play.

<h3 id="e98">Today's Romania: After the Partition of Poland, Losing Lips Leads to Losing Teeth <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zhixuan</p>
<p>It is Quite Difficult to Deal with Being Between Two Powers</p>
<p>The German-Polish War, which lasted less than a month, finally resulted in the disintegration of Poland under the form of the German-Soviet partition. Romania, which is in a position where losing the lips leads to losing the teeth, is probably the second target of the aggressors. However, what will Romania do?</p>
<p>A Target in the Eyes of Aggressors</p>
<p>Romania is a country rich in agricultural raw materials. Its agricultural products are so abundant that it can be called the main food storehouse of Southeastern Europe. Its oil production history is very rich, with annual production exceeding seven million tons. Many of the European countries' mechanized troops' needed oil is supplied from here. Germany is a "oil-less" country, and its need for Romanian oil is even more pressing. If Germany could seize this huge resource—oil and grain—it would not have to fear naval blockades or oil sanctions from various countries; it could take from Romania without any worries. Therefore, how could the aggressors not be drooling over such abundant oil and fertile land?</p>
<p>After the end of the last European war, Romania's territory increased somewhat. In addition to its pre-war territory, it also seized fertile Dobruja from Bulgaria; seized the beautiful Dacian Plateau and Banat from Hungary; and took advantage of the Russian Revolution to recover Bessarabia, which it had lost in 1812. Supported by the power of England and France behind it, it effortlessly ruled this land for ten years. However, today its neighbor Poland has been defeated, and the environment has suddenly changed. These recovered or seized lands are precisely the hidden dangers of future destruction. Who can guarantee that these rapacious aggressor countries will not use this as an excuse to seize Romania's rich resources?</p>
<p>The Stirrings of the Iron Guard</p>
<p>Hitler's usual tactics of aggression are to create internal turmoil in a country and then achieve his goal of occupying it without rewarding a single soldier or firing a single shot. Romania's Nazi Iron Guard is the group he has been subsidizing with financial resources, instructing them to disrupt the government for many years, and their power is quite considerable. Last March, King Carol of Romania, deeply concerned about the threat of the Iron Guard, captured 200 members of the Iron Guard, including its leader, Codreanu, charged them with treason, and sentenced them to ten years of hard labor. As a result, the Iron Guard's arrogance was slightly reduced. At the beginning of this year, Codreanu was shot and killed for escaping from prison, which greatly angered Germany, but King Carol's attitude was firm, and Hitler could do nothing about it.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, more than half a year later, just as there was war in Europe, the Iron Guard of Romania took the opportunity to move again, assassinating Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Calinescu on September 21. It can be seen that the Iron Guard's power in Romania still exists and is stirring restlessly during this turbulent international period.</p>
<p>External coercion and internal crises are indeed pushing Romania's fate to the brink of gunpowder explosion. So how will Romania deal with this?</p>
<p>His Future Fate</p>
<p>According to recent Reuters dispatches from Bucharest, Polish President Mościcki and Polish Army Commander Migrić, who had taken refuge in Romania, were detained by the authorities. This is because Romania fears the aggressor's excuse and has no choice but to do so:</p>
<p>However, before its fate has fundamentally changed, this policy can only temporarily delay being invaded and does not alleviate the crises around it.</p>
<p>Recently, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu arrived in Moscow and will propose a Soviet, Turkish, Romanian, and Bulgarian pact to protect the existing borders of the Soviet Union, Turkey, Romania, and Bulgaria. Therefore, how Romania's situation will develop depends on the attitude of the Soviet Union? At the same time, it also depends on whether Germany will concentrate all its efforts on dealing with Western European democracies or attack Eastern European countries first.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Foreign Exchange and Arbitrage <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Yongsheng</p>
<p>1.  What is Foreign Exchange?</p>
<p>Foreign exchange is the exchange rate of our country against other countries. Because different countries use different currencies, some use the gold standard, some use the silver standard, and the purity and weight of each country are different, the value of currencies is also inconsistent. Foreign exchange is the exchange rate between our country's currency and the currencies of various countries. For example, the British exchange rate, the American exchange rate, the French exchange rate, the German exchange rate, and the Hong Kong exchange rate are the exchange rates of our country's legal tender against the currencies of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>2.  The Price of Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>In normal times, due to trade and other relationships, supply and demand parties buy and sell freely, and the prices are not far apart. However, since the War of Resistance, in order to prevent the escape of funds, foreign exchange control has been implemented. It is currently stipulated that except for the foreign exchange required for necessary imports, which can be applied for supply by the Central Bank, other foreign exchange cannot be purchased at all. Due to the special circumstances in Shanghai, in addition to the legal exchange rate listed by the Central Bank, there is also a black market foreign exchange, that is, the gray market price. There are two types of gray market prices: one is the price listed by HSBC Bank, and the other is the market trading price. The recent reports on the contraction and rise and fall of foreign exchange refer to the gray market. Inquiries show that due to trade relations, there are only two types of British exchange rate and American exchange rate in the market trading. The following is a list of several important foreign exchange prices on September 19:</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate: Value of One British Pound in National Currency</p>
<p>Central Bank Listing:</p>
<p>One Shilling and Two and a Half Pence</p>
<p>HSBC Bank Listing (Selling Price):</p>
<p>Three and a Half Pence</p>
<p>Market Trading Price (Closing):</p>
<p>Four Pence Three Four Three Seven Five</p>
<p>American Exchange Rate: Value of One Hundred US Dollars in National Currency</p>
<p>Central Bank Listing:</p>
<p>Thirty Yuan</p>
<p>HSBC Bank Listing (Selling Price):</p>
<p>Five and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>Market Trading Price (Closing):</p>
<p>Six Yuan Eight Seven Five</p>
<p>French Telegraphic Transfer: Value of One Hundred French Francs in National Currency</p>
<p>Central Bank Listing:</p>
<p>1.080 Francs</p>
<p>HSBC Bank Listing (Selling Price):</p>
<p>253 Francs</p>
<p>Hong Kong Telegraphic Transfer: Value of One Hundred National Currency in Hong Kong Dollars</p>
<p>Central Bank Listing:</p>
<p>95 Hong Kong Dollars</p>
<p>HSBC Bank Listing (Selling Price):</p>
<p>23.25 Hong Kong Dollars</p>
<p>(Note 1) The exchange rates listed by the Central Bank above have not changed since the outbreak of the war. The prices listed by HSBC Bank and the market trading prices often change.</p>
<p>(Note 2) The price listed by the Central Bank is a fictitious price. The original regulations on the review and approval of foreign exchange applications for the legal prices, have now been abolished.</p>
<p>3.  The Occurrence of Arbitrage</p>
<p>Arbitrage is commonly known as "profiting from differences". Because foreign exchange rates are divided into near-term and forward-term, if near-term rates are cheap and forward-term rates are expensive, buying near-term and selling forward-term at the same time can result in a difference. This difference is what is called arbitrage. The greater the difference, the greater the arbitrage interest rate. Foreign exchange arbitrage is mainly initiated by foreign banks (that is, those who post the interest). The size of the difference is determined by the needs (commonly known as "positions") of each foreign bank, and the amounts are not the same across all banks. In addition, they are mostly specified on the order form, stating that this foreign exchange must be deposited in the bank and does not accrue interest. The bank issues a deposit certificate or receipt, so foreign exchange arbitrage can be said to be credit loans absorbed by foreign banks from the Chinese. Most arbitrage is calculated in US dollars.</p>
<p>4.  Simple Calculation Method of Arbitrage Interest Rate</p>
<p>There are two calculation methods for arbitrage interest rates: one is the ordinary method, and the other is the simple method.</p>
<p>The simple calculation method is listed below:</p>
<p>(Difference between the current month's rate and the next month's rate) ÷ (next month's rate) = interest rate (monthly interest)</p>
<p>For example, on August 14, the US dollar price was 6.5 yuan in August and 5.875 yuan in September. The difference is 0.625 yuan. Calculate the monthly interest rate of arbitrage.</p>
<p>0.625 ÷ 5.875 = 106.38</p>
<p>That is, the monthly interest rate is 10% and 6.38%. (Note) The commission for brokers has not been deducted from the interest rate obtained above.</p>
<p>From January to May of this year, the arbitrage interest rate averaged between 4-5% and 5-6%. The market prices in June fluctuated greatly, and the arbitrage interest rate varied by 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%. As for the months of July and August, the highest arbitrage interest rate was as high as 11-12%. That is to say, doing foreign exchange arbitrage, with 10,000 yuan in legal tender, you could get 1,100-1,200 yuan in legal tender in interest after one month. Such a high interest rate is an unprecedented and astonishing record.

<h3 id="e100">The Battle of Dongting Lake: Talking about Changsha <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army violently attacked the Xinqiang River in northern Hunan on the evening of this year's "September 18th Incident," the war situation has become increasingly fierce. The Battle of Dongting Lake, centered on the fight for Changsha, has already begun. Changsha, which was washed by fire on November 12th last year, has once again become the focus of attention for the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Changsha's Topography</p>
<p>Changsha was formerly known as Tanzhou. During the Five Dynasties period, Ma Yin entered and called it Chu. Since the Qing Dynasty, it has been the capital of Hunan Province, with a dense population and bustling industry and commerce. In terms of its topography, it connects to Lingbiao in the south, points to Jingchu in the north, is flanked by Zhangjiang and Ganjiang on the left, and connects to Qianzhong on the right, occupying the key points of Hunan Province and controlling the north-south hub. It is located at the confluence of the Xiangjiang and Liuwei rivers, with a majestic shape. The railway runs through it, and boats and vehicles reach everywhere, making transportation extremely convenient. Therefore, the summer cloth of Liuyang, the porcelain of Liling, the rice of Xiangjiang, and the tea of Anhua are all concentrated here. The rice market is the most prosperous, second only to Wuhu in the country.</p>
<p>Local Attractions</p>
<p>There is Water Egret Island in the heart of the river west of the city, floating in the weaving waves, with lush vegetation and a serene view. Looking into the distance, it is like a night rain in Xiaoxiang, quite interesting. During the second year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty (1852), Hong Xiuquan's army marched north from Guangdong Province and besieged Changsha. The Qing army fought Xiang Rong outside the city, intending to seize Water Egret Island. Just as they were crossing the river, they were attacked from behind by Hong's army around the tail of the island. The 3,000 Qing troops were completely defeated and almost entirely wiped out. Xiang Rong fled in disgrace. This battle can be considered a miracle in the modern Chinese civil liberation war history.</p>
<p>Yuelu Mountain, also known as Yunlu, on the opposite bank of the Xiangjiang River, was formerly known as the tail of the seventh and second peaks of Hengyue, as mentioned in the Jingzhou Ji. The peaks are stacked and beautiful, the winding paths lead to secluded places, the bamboo and trees are lush, and the springs and streams flow. Looking at Changsha from afar, the smoke and trees are vast. Looking down at the Xiangjiang River, the sails are reflected. It is truly the first scenic spot in Changsha. Halfway up the mountain is an industrial school, rumored to be the old site of Yuelu Academy in the Song Dynasty, where Zhang Shi and Zhu Xi both lectured. At the highest point of the mountain are the tombs of the two pioneers who created the Republic of China, Huang Xing and Cai E, which are clearly visible. The remains of Mr. Ding Wenjiang, a famous figure in the modern academic world, are also buried here.</p>
<p>An Unprecedented Catastrophe</p>
<p>The Great Fire of Changsha on October 12th last year can truly be called an eternal catastrophe! After five days and five nights of burning, almost all the essence of the brocade-like Xiangyuan was turned into scorched earth. At that time, the Japanese army on the railway line was still north of Xinqiang River, 115 kilometers away from Changsha. The Japanese army on the highway was also north of Jiuling, 60 kilometers north of Pingjiang. Changsha Garrison Commander Feng Ti and others mistakenly believed the rumors beforehand and were hasty and impatient at the last minute, leading to this disaster. Although they have been executed, they truly deserved to die! Changsha originally had 420,000 to 430,000 people and more than 80,000 households. More than nine-tenths of the population fled before the fire. The remaining number should be no less than 30,000, but more than 2,000 people were buried in the fire!</p>
<p>After being hit by this great fire, Changsha should have been ruined. However, the courage of the Hunanese is admirable. In less than four or five months, Changsha slowly recovered from the scorched earth, and the population gradually increased to 300,000. It was only recently that it was evacuated again, and it is said that it is now no more than 30,000 again.</p>
<p>Military Value</p>
<p>As for the Japanese army's attempt on Changsha this time, most of it was due to political reasons. As Reuters reported, it was just to set off a firecracker on the eve of the establishment of the puppet central government to add some color. According to the opinions of senior Chinese military strategists, as far as the overall war situation on the Chinese side is concerned, after Wuhan, Nanchang, and Yuezhou fell, the gain or loss of Changsha was no longer important. However, the reason why the Chinese side is currently sending elite troops to guard northern Hunan is not only to protect Changsha but also to consume the Japanese army's ammunition and manpower. Although the Japanese army vainly hopes to open up the Yuehan Railway after capturing Changsha, connect with its troops in northern Guangdong, and advance northwest along the highway to Shashi and Yichang, the terrain of Hunan is very dangerous, with the Jianghan Plain and the hilly area of southern Dongting very steep. The northern Dongting Lake is flooded, the central Hengyue Mountain stands, and the southern Five Ridges are horizontal, all of which are natural barriers. I still remember that in the Northern Expedition, after the National Revolutionary Army occupied Hengyang, Wu Peifu's army abandoned Changsha and retreated directly to the border of Hunan and Hubei to fight a decisive battle. It can be seen that Changsha has no value in being defended to the death militarily. Even if the Chinese army abandons Changsha for strategic reasons in the future, it can still advance step by step. The Wan Shan mountains between western Hunan, Hengyang, and Baoqing will be the place for the decisive battle between the two sides. Moreover, the healthy men of the three Xiang areas are chivalrous and righteous, and have the most patriotic spirit. Geography and people are obviously advantageous to the Chinese army. The Japanese army is taking a risk by going deep, no different from suicide! Therefore, in this battle for Changsha, even if the Japanese army is lucky enough to succeed, what they will seize is nothing more than a scorched earth. Even if the Chinese army abandons it, it is the prelude to luring the enemy deep.</p>

<h3 id="e101">General Gamelin, the French Army Commander Who Predicted Events Like a Prophet <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Ying</p>
<p>General Gamelin, the French Army Commander, is a veteran general with the oldest qualifications and most respected. Among the military figures of England and France, he is truly the most experienced and outstanding talent. In the last war, he served under the command of the brilliant General Joffre with the rank of Army Major. At that time, he suggested withdrawing the French army and joining forces with the British army to attack the enemy's right flank in Lille, but initially, Joffre did not adopt this plan. It was not until August 25, when the left flank of the army suffered a major threat, that Joffre was convinced of Gamelin's prophetic abilities and began to implement it, ordering him to command the withdrawal of the troops. Later, because General Joffre used General Kluck of Germany, who went deep into enemy territory alone, he fell into the enemy's trap. Joffre hastily sent Gamelin to transfer the French Paris garrison to the Marne front for encirclement and suppression. In this battle, Gamelin fully demonstrated his talent and completed the task within the scheduled time. In November of that year, the year the war broke out, he was promoted to Major General of the Headquarters. It was not until January 1916 that he left Joffre to serve as the commander of the Second Vanguard at Anmu Harbor. In 1925, he was ordered to help relieve the siege of allied forces in Syria, and his fame greatly increased. In January 1935, he succeeded General Weygand as the Chief of Staff of the French Army. It is said that Gamelin has a great interest in military geography, which has been of great help to his victory over the enemy. Therefore, he highly values this field. When training his subordinates, military geography was listed as an important subject. He also has a very deep understanding of strategy and tactics. From the French Revolution to the end of the Great War, he has a clear understanding of the process of each important battle and strategy, and the key to success or failure. Although he is now an old man with white hair, his spirit is still strong, just like a young man. Therefore, he will definitely be able to fulfill his important responsibilities this time.</p>

<p>I heard that last year, a German missionary was preaching in a church one day, and accidentally said, "A lame man is a liar." Unexpectedly, a few days later, this sentence reached the ears of the German secret police. The police then warned the missionary and said, "What do you mean by this sentence? You must know that our Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels, is a lame man." The teacher knew that things were a bit bad, so he simply did one thing and did it right. He asked, "Could it be that our Minister of Propaganda is a liar?"</p>

<p>— Guanqing</p>
<p>The new women of the Soviet Union participate in almost all kinds of activities within their country, working as men do. If the number of women participating in national cultural and industrial work is analyzed, the results are quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Women account for 71% of the staff in health care organizations, and 56% of school teachers.</p>
<p>Women make up 33% of university students. In medical universities, there are more female students than male students, with a ratio of three to one.</p>
<p>Among the 1,467 leaders of national scientific research institutions, women account for 92. Among the qualified scientists nationwide, there are 7,000 women and 18,000 men. A total of 20,000 technical inventions are registered in the name of women.</p>
<p>A woman named Mrs. Kuxina made a significant contribution to the manufacture of stratospheric balloon gasbags and was awarded the Order of Lenin, the most glorious and rare medal in the Soviet Union. Another woman, Mrs. Gamon Kagiayeva, made extremely ingenious reforms to the method of manufacturing rubber, which can greatly save labor.</p>
<p>In addition, Soviet women were inspired by the feat of Lusinova (the first Soviet woman to explore the Arctic) and now hold leading positions in Arctic exploration, such as Ms. Youshakova's exploration of Mawi Island at the mouth of the Lena River, who is the leader of the Second International Arctic Observation Team, and Ms. Tangmei's leadership of the Northern Winter Camp, which are the most notable.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Autumn Diseases and Their Prevention <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>When autumn arrives, the weather gradually becomes cooler, unlike the sweltering heat of summer, so life feels much more comfortable! However, several diseases, such as dysentery, malaria, and typhoid fever, seem to be prevalent in autumn as if on cue. Therefore, while enjoying the relatively comfortable life in autumn, we must remain vigilant and guard against the invasion of these diseases. Now I will write about the prevention of dysentery, malaria, typhoid fever, etc., which are just some common knowledge for everyone to prevent diseases in autumn.</p>
<p>(1) Dysentery</p>
<p>A. Causes: There are two types of dysentery: one is caused by infection with Shigella bacteria. When the excrement contains only mucus and pus, it is called white dysentery; if it contains a large amount of blood, it is called red dysentery. The other is caused by infection with amoebas and is called amoebic dysentery.</p>
<p>B. Prevention</p>
<p>(1) Flies are the carriers of dysentery. All food and drinks should be covered with gauze. Do not eat any food that is not covered with gauze.</p>
<p>(2) Do not drink raw water.</p>
<p>(3) It is best to peel all fruits before eating.</p>
<p>(4) Do not use the same toilet as people with dysentery.</p>
<p>(5) Do not put the patient's tableware in your mouth; wash it with boiling water after the patient uses it.</p>
<p>(6) Caregivers should wash their hands with medicated soap every time they come into contact with the patient.</p>
<p>(7) Lime can be put into the patient's excrement, which can kill bacteria and prevent flies from breeding.</p>
<p>(8) If dysentery is suspected, the pathogen can be diagnosed by examining the excrement, making it easier to prescribe medication accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) Malaria</p>
<p>A. Causes: The pathogen of malaria is a parasite belonging to protozoa, called Plasmodium sporozoite. It is transmitted by mosquitoes. The transmission route is that mosquitoes suck the blood of patients, and the blood contains pathogens. When they suck the blood of others again, they pass the pathogens on. Once infected, due to the different types and developmental forms of Plasmodium sporozoite, there are three different symptoms:</p>
<p>(1) Tertian fever (intermittent fever)</p>
<p>(2) Quartan fever</p>
<p>(3) Tropical fever</p>
<p>Among the above three types, tropical fever has the most severe symptoms, but this is a malaria that is prevalent in tropical regions and is not common in temperate regions.</p>
<p>B. Prevention</p>
<p>(1) Make efforts to eliminate mosquitoes.</p>
<p>(2) Use mosquito nets in bed.</p>
<p>(3) When malaria is prevalent, take two quinine tablets every three days.</p>
<p>(4) If malaria is suspected, a diagnosis can be made by examining the blood, so that the treatment will not be delayed.</p>
<p>(3) Typhoid Fever</p>
<p>A. Causes: Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi invading the human body. Flies are the carriers of the disease, and all food and drinks containing typhoid bacteria are the route of infection.</p>
<p>B. Prevention</p>
<p>(1) The method is roughly the same as preventing dysentery.</p>
<p>(2) When typhoid fever is prevalent, preventive injections can be given, or typhoid vaccine can be taken internally.</p>
<p>(3) If typhoid fever is suspected, an accurate diagnosis can be obtained by examining the blood and stool, which is easier to treat.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Strange Marriage Customs of the Mongols <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Mongolian men and women are married off by their parents at the age of eighteen or nineteen. Before the marriage is arranged, it is first necessary to see how many cattle and sheep the other party has, just like we look at how much property the other party has.</p>
<p>On the day of the wedding, the groom wears a brand-new Mongolian outfit, rides a fast Mongolian horse, and goes to the bride's side with the matchmaker to pick up the bride; however, the bride's side closes the door and does not let the groom and matchmaker enter. The groom must sincerely explain: he will never treat her harshly or scold her in the future, only then will they allow the bride to go with the groom.</p>
<p>The bride and groom return together, and the man's side also closes the door and does not let the bride enter. The bride must also sincerely explain: she will definitely obey the teachings and guidance of her parents-in-law, only then can the bride and groom enter together.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Early Married Children <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaotan</p>
<p>Due to customs, heredity, bad environment, obscene books and movies, etc., children can mature early. Early-matured children often take the path of early marriage. Various European and Western countries have explicit regulations on the age of marriage, and the household registration survey is precise, so there are fewer early marriages, while the opposite is true in Africa and India.</p>
<p>French marriage laws prohibit girls under the age of fifteen from marrying, but in the barbaric tribes of Africa and India, most girls have already become mothers when European girls are playing with dolls. In the United States, due to the different laws of each state, and the household registration survey in some places is inevitably flawed, so that there are still more than 4,000 girls under the age of fifteen who have been formally married and have become mothers.</p>
<p>This article does not discuss eugenics but only reports the facts: therefore, only the photos of three early-married girls are attached below, with a brief explanation.</p>
<p>Photo 1: This sixteen-year-old Indian boy married a six-year-old girl named Linmeidina. Not long after the marriage, she gave birth to a beautiful baby weighing three kilograms.</p>
<p>Photo 2: In 1938, Ms. Columbus of the United States, who was only ten years old, married a blacksmith, Taketo. Five days after the marriage, her husband abandoned her and fled to the mountains, and could not be found. Columbus was then sent to an orphanage for adoption by the authorities. Since then, the local government has strictly prohibited similar incidents from happening.</p>
<p>Photo 3: In January 1937, in Tennessee, USA, there was a girl named Winsvit, who was only nine years old and was married to a wealthy farmer, John, who was twenty-two years old. He was a giant and seven feet tall.</p>

<p>— Junpei</p>
<p>According to his latest research, Dr. William Johnson, a famous American medical doctor, believes that a woman's weight and height should have a certain standard to be considered a beautiful figure; therefore, he has formulated a comparison table. Currently, female college students use this comparison to test their weight.</p>
<p>Dr. William Johnson's standards are as follows:</p>
