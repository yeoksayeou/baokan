<h3>重慶各報　重視日美談話　日如不放棄現有政策　決難與美國取得妥洽</h3>
<p>重慶　此間華方人士、對於日本不日即將與英美開始談話之消息、極為注意、今晨各華字報紙對之、皆有長篇評論、述及其意義之重大、並推測其或可能之結果、中國陸軍喉舌掃蕩報、著有「美日外交戰」一文、謂東京目下正採用一種威脅與談判兼施之策略、日方曾晤示揚子江之重行開放、惟美國之「開放門戶」、與日本之「東亞新秩序」、決不能互相融洽、相信美國在談判之中、必將堅持九國公的之基本原則、即（一）尊重中國之獨立、及領土主權、（二）予中國以建立強有力政府之權會、（三）保持各國在華貿易之機會均等、（四）無論何國不得利用中國之情况、干預其他國家在華之利益與特權、該報末稱、日本若因執「田中奏摺」之政策、則極少妥洽之可能性云、超然派之新民報、對於英日不久即將在東京談判之消息、作文評述、調英日之談判、比蛟不甚重要、質言之、英國目下對於遠東、勢難全力注視、故英國對於英日間之懸案、似不企圖作澈底之解决、况現時日本在華程序中之主要障碍、厥為美國、而非英國、如美日間之問題、能獲解决、則英日談判、將不難臻於妥洽、惟日本如不能調整其對美關係、則將不能對英施以壓力、相信日本將集中其努力於對美之談判、而不亟求英日問題之一般的解决也、故外傳東京英日談判、將祇限於天津糾紛云云、實不無相當理由、英日未來之談判、將祗限於地方事件之解決、或將成立一種局部之妥洽、亦未可知、其於一般的妥協、或英日關係完全破裂、則皆未必能成為事實、換言之、英日關係、將仍在「半死」之狀態中也、新民報謂聞美日談判不日即將開始、此舉甚關重要、美日關係似將因此判分一決定的階段、如談判決裂、則料美國或將對日取積極計劃、或以繼續援助中國之方式之、或以禁止軍火運日之方式出之、日本所需之戰品、其百分之八十強供給於美國、現有理由可信未來之談判將決定日本在華之命運、如美國對日實行經濟抵制、則日本難支持六月以上、如日本希望與美國獲得妥洽、則必須放棄其所謂建立東亞新秩序政策、吾則此後一切、唯上天知之耳、（卅日路透社電）</p>

<p>重慶　中國人民外交協會、頃以冗長之備忘錄、提交出席十一月問在美國佛爾吉尼亞州舉行太平洋關係大會之中國代表團、力言英美有互相合作、以求解決中日局勢之必要、其內容略稱、東亞之和平及秩序、係一九二二年華盛頓會議所樹立、惟九國公的所規定之條件、一日未能恢復、則遠束卽無和平之可言、吾人深信英美互相合作、並聯合與中國合作、實為遠東唯一之穩定因素、因英美缺乏合作、結果被日本侵入滿洲、倘使所謂東亞新秩序者、果見建立、則列強在華之權利、必將終止、吾人希望英美此後精誠合作、以維持中國門戶之開放、美國自歐戰爆發以來、已成為遠東方面之主角、日本則顯所襲用其在上次大戰期內將採用增強對華侵略之故技、現時能遏止日本在華之侵略、並挽救各國之利益者、唯有美國而已、該備忘錄又促請美國以經濟上之壓力、加諸日本、謂日本經兩年戰事、經濟已吿枯竭、對於美國將難報復云、該備忘錄續謂中日戰事之解決、將有賴於九國公約各簽字國家之一致努力、並希望彼等能採用下列之程序、（一）援助中國並迫使日本遵守其在九國公的之義務、以維護國際條的之莊嚴、（二）日本一日不停止其侵略、則美日商的決不繼續、（三）對日實施經濟制裁、實行國聯通過之決議案、該備忘錄最後更請求美國以召集九國公的者之資格、領導保護各國在華之權益、謂中國自將根據九國公的之精神、對於美國此項努力、予以密切之合作、（三十日路透社電）</p>

<h3>美修正中立法案　渝各報著論批評　此案既不利於中國　亦不能收弭戰之效</h3>
<p>重慶　此間各華文報紙、對於美參院十月二十七日通過已修正之中立法案事、均用大字登載、並一致表示讚許、中央日報著論批評此事云、美國已修正之中立法、雖不利於中國、惟因有下列各項理由、故吾人對於美參院之行動、表示贊同、（一）中立法可代表美國反對侵略及贊助和平之基本政策、（二）在現時環境之下、美國實無法成立一種法律、而使之適應歐洲及遠東雙方之需要、與其為謀適應雙方需要之故、致引起困難及糾紛、則不如先集中其努力於一方面之為愈、美國儘可於應付歐洲局勢之後、再轉移其全部注意力於遠東、（三）中國對於美國之同情、有極充分之信任、美國駐日大使格魯最近在東京之演說、已可證明美國對於遠東、決不致置於不顧、（四）懷麗日本或將利用此項中立法而向中國宣戰之思想、實毫無根據、尤其因美日之關係、已接近決斷之階段、日本方面如繼續侵略、必將引起美國相當之反應、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>重慶　中國共產黨機關報新華日報、今日社論、對於美國新中立法案大施抨擊、認其偏袒英法以對德國、因此不僅不能防止歐戰之蔓延、反使美國間接參加歐洲之戰爭、此在德國當為一大打擊、但決非維持世界和平之道、故此案若能於歐戰未爆前成立、或能收弭戰之效、至於今日、則已失去此項效用矣、再則新中立法已使美國成為英法之間接同盟者、故美國至今已不能視為中立矣、總之、美國此次中立法之修正、純為美國金融資本家與軍火商所策動、最後該報對於新中立法有利日本不利中國之處、亦表示極大之失望、（三十日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>美國中立法與國際地位</h3>
<p>美國之中立法修正案，既於日前通過於彼參議院；據昨日華盛頓電訊，孤立派已自承失敗，本案在衆議院亦不難獲得多數贊成。美國修正中立法後，影響於各交戰國者如何，姑置不論；然美國之國際地位，與總統羅斯福氏之聲望令譽，則因中立法之修正而更著矣。</p>
<p>美國之國際地位有如今日，初非機會使然；得瓜得豆，有其種因焉。彼天賦豐厚、顧豈獨豐：環境優良，顧豈獨優；乃得獨步國際者，謂非彼國人士長於政治，善治生產所致歟？惟善治生產，故富力充盈，甲於宇內，此顯見之事實也。惟長於政冶，故國際利害所繫，國內聚訟所集之中立法案，卒有合法合理之成就；而其經過之紆曲，爭議之精采，允見現代政治之化境。雖然，以中立法案稱道美國政治，猶其小焉者也；就其犖犖大端言之：舉國奉公守法，政治務循大法常軌，故其國政常在平衡猛進之中，國力國勢遂莫與京，此其一也。深得善鄰立國之三昧，視新大陸弱小之邦有如弱弟，尊敬其獨立自由，尊敬其主權領土，必誠必信，加惠而無德色，絕不欺凌侵潤更無論矣；標榜門羅主義而弱小實受其愛護之賜，無有不知其非覇道者；不以反共反注西為要挾，而民治自成正宗；不以武力財力為工具，而經濟上自趨於合作，以臻共榮；未嘗標榜王道，顧近之矣，此其二也。對歐亞，不恃強力干涉；然正義所在，則持正不阿，見義勇為；休休有容，予各種罪惡以自反之餘地而未嘗枉公道；最向希特拉呼籲和平，不效，今則修正中立法；曾向日本剴切警告，不效，於是先之以宣告廢止商的，然仍予以半年之猶豫；舉世莫疑以掠奪漁利分贓，莫不心領神會於其正氣逼人，無敢輕侮，此其三也。</p>
<p>美國，民治國也；揆之禍福相倚，利弊相隨之義，蓋無一制一事，乃得盡善，惟權衡重輕以為取舍耳；美國之民治，亦然。是以國際地位而論，美國頭角崢嶸，伊非朝夕，而其比重之高，於今為甚；此無他，民治制度之下，總統雄才偉略，其器度德望復足以領導羣倫，於是所積焉厚，相得益彰；此國此時得此羅斯福氏，宜其國際地位之戞戞獨造矣。美國之中立法，其國內法也，子法也，條款存廢，爭議時逾半載，贊吾超越黨見，此其是非短長，姑置勿論；然本案之性質，在國際則為美國外交政策傾嚮所徵，在政治則為總統羅斯福氏成敗所繫。若美國非民治國而羅斯福氏為之元首，則舉重若輕，朝令夕行可也；若中立法之意義筒明，利害灼然，則衆議僉同，一致通過可也；顧乃民治政制而適逢見解紛歧。若中立法而無關宏旨，修正與吾，委之立法人員，則任之贊成反對可也；若政制則民治，總統則怯弱，明知宜然而無法使之竟然，則由彼雌黃，付之一歎可也；然而國際地位則為之貶抑矣。何也，國政猶所不能把握，詎得有為於國際，自非國際所畏敬矣。以中立法修正案，反對派氣燄之盛，以戰禍危言之易於聳動，爭議綦久，波折迭生，而終於博得多數擁護，非羅斯福氏之雄才偉略，器度德望，不克致也。於是知美國之為民治國，非堅白異同之論所得而搖撼分化，而羅斯福氏之政治生命亦未可量也。白前傳有選舉羅氏二决連任三任總統之主張，此在美國，憲法原無限制，政史却無先例；事在明年，非可逆覩矣。</p>

<h3>宋美齡對美　廣播原詞　（續前日）</h3>
<p>重慶　我們覺得我們的要求是合理的、因為美國若果不這樣做、就等於承認文明巳成灰燼、就等於承認人類的心靈已經消失、利忘義的魔鬼、已取世人所信仰的上布地位而代之了、如今那威脅文明的可悲的禍害、已經使世界上發生了一種新的現象、有許多人民、許多國家、為了要逃避他們的責任、為了嬰使他們那條經濟自保的給舶、能在極權主義的怒潮裏安穩渡過、於是偷安苟容地轉過背去、向着趨利而忘義的魔鬼精首頂禮、不再向他們以前所承認的上帝屈膝祈禱了、這樣為了外交竟把宗敎精神摒之於戶外、然宗敎畢竟是文明的主要柱石、沒有宗敎就沒有國際正義、也沒有共同的是非、一切信誓旦旦的諾言、也就無所保證了、現在條的巳失去信用、就因為條的巳失掉了人類精神的擁護、而喪失了神聖與尊嚴、我們誰都知道若干人慾的政府、一旦意圖搗亂世界、尋求權利、而認為條的不便他們的時候、立地可以把那些宗敎精神已經脫離關係的條的、加以破壞、明載於國際文件中的人類言詞、轉瞬之間已變成了沒有拘束力量、沒有地位與價値的東西、若果現在我們要挽救文明、必須復活那中古十字軍時代一樣的義勇無私的精神、我們必須重復鼓起勇氣來、為民主主義基礎的若干道義原則、不屈不撓的奮鬥、那末人類的自由、人權的神聖、庶幾還能存留在世界之上、沒有宗敎任何國家都不能長久立足、這個道理現在常然非常明顯的了、條的簽訂者如能受宗敎的道義所的束、就不會再有條的破壞者、意圖作毀滅工作的人、倘心中有宗敎的情緒、促其覺悟、世界上也就不再有毀滅的行為、那些出售軍火於破壞國際法律的侵略者、而從中漁利的人們、假使宗敎的思想能深入他們的心中、也就會停止他們助人作戰的行為、因而沒有侵略、沒有犧牲者了、現在要算我們中國人民理解這個意思最為深切、我們已實際做了摧殘國際條的與法律的野蠻主義的犧牲品、這種野蠻主義的復活、實在是近世文明進步一個大汚點、在這種神聖紀元的一九三九年、這種事實顯然是保障人權維護條的現代觀念的一種慘痛的新註解、所謂保障人權、豈不就是大家所認為文化特徵之一切若何宗敎、及其一切的啟示、重返人間、大家的處世接物、都受宗敎道義的指導與的束、那末國間的正義、也會重復確立、同時猜忌偏私欺騙傷身以及戰爭等現象、將迅速地完全消失、公理將重新支配世界、為人類謀取永久的幸福、由人與人間、事與事間的互相諒解、以求得和平秩序的恢復、我們婦女負有極大的責任、當這文化行將崩潰的時候、當大家卑鄙地向私利之神稽首往墮落的深淵出進的時候、當一部分人在瘋地用了蠻橫的武力、滅絕人道自逞私圖的時候、在我們正是一個挺身救世的絕好機會、許多世代以來、文化的進步、社會的安定、論起功績、我們婦女實有不少的寳貴貢默、這種前輩的遺澤、我們是不能忽略的、我們必須聞風興起、以期無愧我生、沒有徬徨、沒有退縮、我們祇有前進、我們要有古時十字軍一樣的精神、永遠有那個不屈不撓的十字架、在我們的前面、人類的心靈、若不能有急劇的改變、我們之中總有人會親眼看到那殘酷地毀滅我中國的暴行、進而毀滅整個的文化、現在祇有一樣東西可以挽救這人類的災禍、那就是宗教、然而惡魔的雲翳、還不免掩蓋了宗敎光芒、對於這一點、我是萬分感到悲悼的總括一句話、當國家與個人的意識都能以宗敎的信仰為依歸、當人類的生活與行為都能以宗敎為樞點與動力、到那個時候、文明的劫運方始有了轉機、不然的話、那就沒有挽救的希了、（廿七日電）</p>

<h3>戰時歐洲進行曲（續）　倫敦特約通信</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>（五）到戰爭的路</p>
<p>昨天的泰晤士報上，出現了一篇重要的社論，標題是：「這是一個人的罪惡」；內容呢，對於這一次戰爭挑起的責任，認為應該由希特拉一個人獨負。已經發表了的，英政府對德宜戰的宜言，也在强調地，責備希特拉的屢次背信，終於引起戰爭。一走到倫敦街頭，你可以立刻見到，由每日反映報社特別印行的通緝希特拉的招貼，是貼滿了大街小巷的每一角落。那上面，印着希特拉的近照，加上說明道：「某某，某處人氏，年五十一歲，身長五呎八吋，蓄短髭，髮分梳，額際常懸環曲形之髪一攝，着褐色杉，……」等等。接着，就羅列出一條一條的罪名，如：「人道的謀害者」，「奧地利案的主兇」，「波蘭人的屠殺者」，……等等。於是再接着，用大字說明着道：「該犯罪大惡極，性極殘忍，任何人遇之，皆可格殺勿論」云云。</p>
<p>在這種種的宣傳解釋之下，每一個在街上走着的英國人，你要是和他談到這回戰事，提到戰爭的原因時，他立刻會吿訴你：「希特拉」</p>
<p>誠然，假如我們回想一下希特拉在我的奮鬥一書裏所說，再把近幾年來德國向外擴張的經過，拿來對照一下，那符合的程度，實在是非常可驚的！也就猶如我們看過田中奏摺之後，再來看一看這幾年來日本侵略中國的前後每一步驟。現在的問題是：按照我的奮鬥，德國的擴張，是絕無止境的；那充其極，就是如不久前，這裏一位外交名人所說：不是德國統制世界，就是德國被人擊潰。所以，在這裏，我們又不禁在心頭上，浮起了去年法國名政論家塔布衣夫人，在「勒詐與戰爭」那本書裏，這麼明白寫着的警句：「今天歐洲及全世界的危機，並不在於侵略集團國家實力的眞正膨大，和平反侵略集團國家的力量，共起來，比牠們要大得多。而眞正的危機呢，却在於歐洲某某幾個大國當局的苟安和別有用意。在這不斷由這一面讓步而逐漸積聚起來的，侵略國家的軍事經濟力量中，一到某一個程度時，那時，世界的眞正危機，就到來了。」</p>
<p>去年和今年這兩年內，歐洲經過的所謂大戰「危機」，至少在十多個以上，看起來，在德·意·經常動員着狀態下（一般估計，德國經常動員的人數的二百萬；意大利在一百五十萬以上。）歐洲大戰，有隨時隨地爆發的可能；可是，祗要我們再深進一層去看，那末，你立就可以覺得；這一連串而來的「危機」，實在是，一偭比一個來得嚴重，每一個「危機」過去了，接着不久而來的另一「危機」中，侵略國的氣燄，就更加較前凶悍一次，戰爭的可能，也就較前加大一次，舉例來說，去年捷克事變的前夕，德國大多數軍人，是反對希特勒及一班國社黨人的冒險舉動的，所以，在那大戰似乎一觸即發的常兒，德國的當時參謀長倍克，忽然辭了職。而今年三月的捷克事件，連軍人也都贊同了希特拉的冒險。這一次波蘭事件呢，在德蘇協定未簽前，一班德國軍人，是反對對但澤用兵的，所以，當里本特洛甫未飛莫斯科之前，希特拉個人的最後決定，一直地，在軍人與國社黨人之間的爭論上，來回動搖著的：一直到里本特洛甫挾着蘇德互不侵犯協定飛回莫斯科之後，於是，希特拉就下了最後決定進攻波蘭！這一次希特拉的最大原則，還是一個所謂「雷電一般快的」速决戰，打算在幾個禮拜之內，（也許是四個，也許是兩個。）解决波蘭。所以，據說，他這一次截至目前為止，調到東戰塲上第一綫及預備使用的隊伍，數在一百萬以上。這一點，聽說德國的軍人，曾與希特拉之間，起了一點意見上的爭論；前者，認為在西綫與英·法·對峙情勢下，這樣大批向東綫調兵，是很冒險的。而希特拉呢，大前提，他是不相信英·法·會大規模進攻的，其次，縱使英·法·同時進攻，他也準備應戰。我們必須注意到；這一點，是一個大大的變更！在我的奮鬥裹，他是攻擊前次大戰威廉第二東·西·兩錢同時應戰的；而現在，他居然已經自信到這樣地步，不惜東·西·同時作戰。這一切，說明的是什麽呢？是在說明着，德國不惜大戰的決意，一天比一天來得增大。那末，牠的根原在那裏？很簡單，在於牠不斷的幾何積數似的，實力一天一天的增積。</p>
<p>這一切，又替未來指出一個明白動向；萬一德國在波蘭得志，牠未來作戰的決意，還更會十倍百倍於今天；而同時，那時擊敗他的可能性，也會相對地減了下去。所以，英。法。的當局，雖是面對着比去年「慕尼黑會議」的力量大了幾乎一倍的敵人，那時不應戰而妥協，現在却不妥協而來應戰了！</p>
<p>這，就是今天在英國喧嚷一時的所謂「打倒希特拉主義！」</p>
<p>「慕尼黑會議」是促進和平還是促進戰爭呢，這時，已經有了非常明顯的答案。</p>
<p>又不禁想起了去年十二月，塔布衣夫人來倫敦時。在歡迎會裏所說的話：「反對或贊成慕尼黑會議態度的決定，並不在於個人的是吾贊成和平或天性好戰。說起來，我個人比張伯倫先生，恐怕還要反對戰爭的多，原因很簡單；我有兩個兒子，一戰起來，都要上戰塲的，這當然是我最不願見到的事。可是問題的焦點，是在於怎樣可以制止戰爭的爆發，這一點，我和張伯倫先生的想法，是完全不同的。」</p>
<p>再把眼光向更遠一點的過去回顧一下吧：那邊，從一九三一的日本侵略東三省起，意大利與阿比西尼亞戰爭，西班牙戰爭，中日戰爭，德國併奧併捷克，意大利的併阿爾巴尼亞，現在是，德國開始進攻波蘭了，而同時却與英·法·發生了戰事。一步，一步，又一步，……一步留下一個血跡，又一步留下另一個更大的血跡，……在每一步裹，英·法·分明是可以以國聯為工具，加以集體制止的，而終於妥協了，默認了，甚至加以鼓勵了，而不料一轉瞬間，却與英。法。自己對了面。這樣子，就形成了這一次的到戰爭的路。（九月四日）</p>

<h3>最近半年間　東亞商務之鳥瞰　昭然　瑞士特約通訊</h3>
<p>一九三九年（民二十八）上半年之東亞商務、較諸前一年之上半年、和盤統算、雖見略佳、而如將各地情况分別此觀、則以增加與退减之不同、而彼此大有出入、茲特揭舉增加與退减之原因、</p>
<p>（甲）助長商務之繁榮者美國市况之勝過往年、一也、全世界橡皮價與生絲價之高漲、二也橡皮之便大宗出口向歐美、三也、日本機器與軍用品輸入東北四省之激增四也、</p>
<p>（乙）阻礙商務之繁榮者、東亞大陸之戰爭、未吿結束、一也、日本出全力以隔斷他國向中國之商務往還、二也、日本製造能力、因受戰事影響而衰减、不邊出口向他國、三也、斐列賓羣島凡百事業之頽落、四也、</p>
<p>至若本年之上半年進出口之大概情形、則有如下述之每月平均統計、</p>
<p>統計表以日本居首列、其問誠不免以日本與陷落區、混為一談、發生「重複計算」之錯誤、而在東亞商務之由日本國占主重部位、自屬顯而易見、查此半年之商務動向、亞洲北方與南方、各有一集中之點、北為日本口岸與直隸海灣、南為海峽殖民地與南洋羣島、日本忙於戰事、無力得外匯、無力廣收外國原料、以助國內工業之繁興、共對高麗台灣等地、旣不暇以輕工業消費品、源源出口、而對中國各地、更不能利用機會、更不能使工業製造品之進口暢銷、目前中國商務之與外國來往者、自十八行省之本部言、日本僅占百分之三十、自陷落區言、日本的占百分之四十、中國北方口岸之進出貿易、日本雖已獨占百分之七十、然此僅為他國對華貿易頻受阻、撓之故、非為日本貨進口之比往昔為多、</p>
<p>若將進出口兩項分別計之、則外國貨之向中國進口者、此諸戰禍未發生之兩年前、僅减百分之十、相差尙不甚鉅、例如上海新近進口之棉花、的占全國需求額之五分一、卽其進口項下之一宗重大貨色、反之、中國貨之出口向海外、却因主要交通綫之被阻或被擾、大為絀减、比諸戰釁未啟以前、聞已减去百分之五十矣、</p>
<p>同時在另一方面、日本却求在陷落區得原料、使能大量出口向日本、此舉雖經日方之努力進行而終歸失敗、</p>
<p>當代地理政治學家之論、猶謂日本對華作戰之目的、為求取得中國之原料、以助三島軍事工業之進行、而遂向外拓展之計、不料經事實之證明、結果適得其反、至如本年七月下半月中國幣價之頽跌、實令外國向中國之進口貨、遭遇甚大之難關、本年八月份之外貨進口額、顯已銳减、香港一口岸之進口額、比諸一九三八年之上半年、减去百分之十二、而出口額尙無减色、其進口之所以今不如前、只因日軍佔廣州、截去香港之後路也、香港在日佔汕頭以前、尙能改借汕頭為後路、今則可共香港、成為南部亞洲商務上之聯手者、一為法屬廣州灣、一為葡屬澳門、以上兩口岸、均有廣大之後路、可資商務進出口之銜接與呼應、</p>
<p>此外法屬越南、在本年上半年之六個月間、因中國貨過境之多、而市面大見起色、其本地之出口事業、亦在潛興暗長之中、英屬海峽殖民地、則因橡皮得善價而出口額突見繁榮、荷屬南洋羣島橡皮出口之盈益、其先尙不足與錫及石油曁棕欖油出口頽减之損失相抵、而此各門出口貨、自七月以還、已見普遍之活動矣、</p>

<h3>金融　外匯鬆勢日甚一日　華商多頭十去其六　美滙逼近九元關口</h3>
<p>外　匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌描曉、因連日英鎊降落、致英金掛高一五、計四辦士半、美匯祗掛大三一二五、為七元四三七五、共他除德匯無市外、亦一致放長、英美匯暗市、情况鬆硬之厲、日甚一日、英金已越過日前最高價五辦士二五、曾一度喊過五辦士三七五、美滙幾達九元新關、實因時作時輟之和平空氣、又囂塵上、見仁見智、實不値識者之一顧、但對於歐戰之逐漸擴大、且傳倫敦財部決於下月十五日起嚴厲統制匯兌、加以國內戰事順利、金融極臻鞏固、此為近日來趨鬆之重要因素、至全日過程、晨初因海外匯兌美對英又縮半分、致美較英為緊、英計〇一五六二五、美為〇六二五、繼因紗花帮及港電首塞猛鬆達英金五辯士三七五、美匯八元九三七五、（聞華商多頭已出範十分之六以上）、嗣後沙遜匯豐有利等購納、立回軟至五辯士一八七五、及八元六二五、惟港電及投機商再出、雖洋行有扒、但延至午收、仍硬達英金五辦士二八一二五、美匯八元七八一二五、午後情況稍平、初以匯豐麥加利復興買胃、曾稍轉軟、卒以港電及美行吐出、重趨硬化、迄至晚收、狀態未有若何變化、英金為五辦士二五、美匯為八元七五、較上日、英長一四〇六二五、美硬一一八七五、至期貨交易略有做開、但又稍軋攏、情形與現貨相同、全日交易尚旺、</p>
<p>滙豐掛牌再見放長</p>
<p>晨　初以倫教大條、及美銀價均無來電、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對法均平、對滬長一八七五、美對英跌半分、對滬大二角、對法小二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五辦士〇九三七五、美滙八元四六八七五、較上週末央緊〇一五六二五、美軟〇六二五、美較英為軟、乃匯兌續縮之故、開後因香港前來電塞兼華商紗花帮亦起賣風、加之美行大通某行亦均懷拱意、致市勢大鬆、英金由五辦士一二五長至三二五、美滙亦由八元半、硬達八七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉英長二五、美大三一二五、白銀平衡稅揭曉、則無升降、此後十時半光景、最硬英金曾喊過五辦士三七五、美滙亦呌過八允九三七五、旋以滙豐吃胃陡濃、且沙遜與有利等亦跟踪吸納、故情勢頓轉、英金立回緊至五辦士一八七五、美滙亦回軟至八元六二五、迨至十一時後、買方吃胃又淡、雖進口洋行稍來扒結、但因港電與投機商復起賣風、一度英金又長至五辦士三一二五、美匯亦重硬達八兀八一二五、午刻為狀稍平、午收銀行現貨賣價央金五辦士二八一二五、美匯八元七八一二五、比晨開英回鬆一八七五、美亦回硬三一二五、</p>
<p>期現距離又稍軋攏</p>
<p>後　市情况平靜、首因匯豐麥加利納胃尙佳、市勢曾稍帶軟、英金由五辦士二五緊至二一八七五、美匯由八元七五、軟至二二五、入後因港電續有吐出、且美行大通某行賣意復濃、故晚收銀行現貨賣價英金又硬達五辦士二五、美滙亦又鬆至八元七五、本月份與上價相同、十一月份英金五辦士二一八七五、美滙八元六八七五、結果比上週六、現貨與本月英均鬆一四〇六二五、美俱硬二一八七五、十一月份英長一五六二五、美賤二五、</p>

<h3>外幣下降亦速</h3>
<p>昨日外匯鬆動趨劇、烚赤下跌猛烈、英美金鎊供給驟增、繼續下降、英美金票拋塞甚盛、客戶需要激减、市價下降乃驟、香港法郞票需要亦稀、市價疲弱、新加坡荷蘭安南票等俱呈頽唐、坎拿大票供求較稀、下降亦微、斐律濱·澳金·暹羅票等穩定未更、惟脚地終見疲弱、日金票供給較殷、盤旋帶軟、晚市為一元三角一分二厘、朝鮮票需要見增、晚市為一元零九分，昨日市價、英金鎊降一元五角、英金票降一元、美金鎊降二元、美金票降三角三分、香港票新加坡票俱降五分、法郞票降五厘、荷蘭票降二角、安南票降一角五分、坎拿大票降一角、其他未更、</p>
<h3>與匯兌亦步亦趨　金市每況愈下</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚金暗盤市況、益覺萎靡不振、局勢難脫徘徊之境、雖香港帮需要尙見活躍、然採辦額子不大、故未能振起市塲人心、而一般散戶鑒於外匯逐步放長、及天津帮之源源塞出、絕少買進心思、且多數浮多亦放棄扳價、大都抱薄利主義出售、至全日過程隨外匯鬆軟為轉移、晨初因外滙明暗大長及證券帮與某金號之猛撳、竟暴落靠近百元為三千六百三十元開盤、旋以外滙轉緊、激動人心、某金號頓止售扒進、兼某證券帮亦入市搜購、加之某錢兌業趁機猛抬、故曾提上至三千七百元當日高峯、午後因外匯復鬆、加以當日散戶紛圖了結、致收盤祇三千六百五十六元、較上週末父狂跌六十九元、全天交易尙旺、的一千三百餘兩、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌六九元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開依然散漫無勁、飾聞外匯明暗放長、人心更虛、一片喊賣聲、某金號與證券帮撳價允力、開市竟較上週末暴落九十五元、證券帮售予銀樓帮三十兩、價為三千六百三十元、少頃雖外滙仍鬆、但因一部份鑒價廉收買、同時客帮亦託某錢兌撈進、一霎那抬起五十元、某錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、為三千六百八十元、此後因證券帮與某金號復來猛塞、兼銀樓帮亦套賣頗殷、遂再小五十五元、證券帮金號及銀樓帮共吐予某錢兌業七十兩、價均為三千六百二十五元、旋以外匯突然回緊、人心一振、而某金號急極移轉目標、從事收買、兼某證券帮亦來跟進、且某錢兌業趁勢抬價、致回漲七十五元、銀樓帮進錢兌二十兩、為三千七百元、十一時後外匯忽又趨鬆、買者漸少、某金號忽又復吐、證券報錢兌業亦互相塞出、致重降落五十五元、證券帮售予銀樓帮三十兩、為三千六百四十五元、午刻錢兌業稍來吸進、拉起十五元、錢兌業進金號二十兩、為三千六百六十元作午收價、午後初開頗平、首由證券帮吐予錢兌業三十兩、仍三千六百六十元、繼錢兌業等拋出撳小十元、錢兌業賣予金號二十兩、為三千六百五十元、時外滙帶軟、及某金號等吸收拉起三十元、金號進證券帮二十兩、為三千六百八十元、入後外匯重稍轉硬、且錢兌業與證券帮相繼吐售、價遂不支下挫、步落二十四元、錢兌業互做十兩、為三千六百五十六元、作晚收價、結果比上週末軋跌六十九元、聞收後證券都售予某銀號二十兩、為三千六百五十四元、全犬七十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進須减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景</p>
<p>飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百七十五元、迨至九時四十五分掛小五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸三百七十元、新同行與上價相同、收進須减低十五元之讀、</p>
<h3>證劵　統丙一度　達五十元　祥泰木行派息</h3>
<p>證　劵暗盤、昨日市況趨勢漸見良好、丙戌種一度發現五十元、自穴月十三日後此為最近之新高價、祗以多方逢高賣出、致未能立定、但昨日經過、上午行市趨勢最佳、買戶如大豐久孚潤利等頗為踴躍、雖賣方亦頗不弱、如德孚之不斷脫手、但仍冉冉上騰、午前即好起六七角、午後初開漲勢仍猛、如十一號及二十號需要仍殷、丙戌種均高到五十元大關、惜、德浮號仍有大批出範、聯益永大亦有多頭斬結、故市仍被壓迫面未能立定、前途仍係跌亂漲易之局、結果統漲三五角、成交總數約有一百二十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股　票交易成交紗布交易所股五十股、價為四十元零五角、比前又略高云、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市相當活潑、業廣地產公司之股、漲勢鼎沸、淩駕一切、蓋關於北區之各種謠傳極為繁興也、開盤時買價為九元二角、霎那間騰越至十元五角、此價引起不少獲利了結、市况反動略回至十元二角買進、三角賣出收盤、因此項股票獨特活躍之結果、其他各股、顯被蔭蔽、而乏出色紀錄、惟價格堅穩、不過於前日耳、</p>
<p>英商祥泰木行有限公司、昨經董事會議決、根據本月三十日之股東名册、開派中期股息、每股國幣一元二角五分、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市變成兩處集會　內銷清淡市價慘跌</h3>
<p>紗　市下挫、且跌風尤織、此因實需太滯、據某棉業機關消息、謂內地昆明重慶等處之棉紗棉布消費旣淸、而行市不振、故客帮仍無採辦能力、交易寂寞、加之集會塲所遷移新世界東部二樓、但有一部份客帮未曾參加、另在交易所中聚會、原因謂新地址電話缺乏、消息旣隔閡、而呼應不靈、於是變成兩處集會處所、以是市價參差不齊、二十支雙馬紗價新世界開價為六百四十元、交易所價做六百四十六元、相差六元之鉅、可想其中雜亂無章、不過因新搬塲决序未能歸一、往後下去、當可恢復常態也、</p>
<p>現　紗晨開氣象散漫乏勁、開價二十支天女價為六百三十三元、雙馬價為六百四十元、均係現貨、旋聞外滙步鬆不已、買者缺乏、市價再挫、雙馬跌至六百二十八元、查半日間成交統計僅三百四十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌二十二元半、天女跌十二元、今日出口有紗二十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行二九〇香港一〇福建　五</p>
<p>溫州　三〇廈門一〇統計　三四五</p>
<h3>交易停頓　棉價日落</h3>
<p>本　棉交易、形同停頓、中外各廠絕少動意、蓋以棉紗、市價一蹶不振、廠方處此環境中、對於原料補進一層、意態愈見衰弱、加之外滙鬆弛日甚、致人心更難安謐也、但蘇北來源驟形减縮、僅到通州花一百十八包、常陰沙七百七十八包、北沙來六百四十包、現棉僅同業中幾家成交通州花七百包、價為一百二十九元半至一百二十八元半云、</p>
<p>另　訊、滬埠外棉交易、因日來滙兌之鬆動、廠方以紗價之慘落、同業以棉價之折合低落殊巨、手貨無法出籠、因之亦不願低價塞出也、靑島帮交易亦靜寂異常、故外棉交易已入於困難狀態中、一時恐難有轉機之可能也、</p>
<p>外　棉市價、紐的棉市、日來頗為堅定、晨初殊形活躍、布疋銷數日見暢通、因之廠需頗為健旺、孟買來電高昂、人心為之一振、海外棉商在市購買亦甚踴躍、因之收盤價格較之上日漲四至八磅音不等、埃及棉市頗為參差不齊、漲跌五見、印度連同預測漲四羅比漲</p>
<h3>疋頭　氣候驟冷　絨布旺銷　—海白龍飛漲—</h3>
<p>布　市昨以外匯放長，人心虛怯、惟粗布絨貨、銷路活潑、影響尙徵、售盤升降範圍亦窄、各檔輕重磅粗布以月底旣屆、所有急切求售之囤貨早已脫手、餘外囤戶始終未動、故粗布市面每疋又抬高一二角、漸與廠盤相接近、本街及浙東溫甬台各帮辦粗布四百餘包、細布細斜三四十包、閩帮辦色斜色布五十餘件、粵帮辦粗布絨布色布色斜一百餘件、本街門市生意、以西北風倐起、氣候驟冷、各種絨布銷塲大旺、購胃甚濃、九磅半嗶嘰條絨開價十六元五角至十七元、雙面條絨開價十七元五角之譜、價殊堅穩、</p>
<p>東　布白貨因紗價又跌、人心軟弱、且因月底關係、同業觀望者居多、故細布·細斜市塲交易甚形冷落、售盤再度下游、各降每疋一角之譜、十二磅龍頭細布現貨喊價十八元六角半、細斜十七元四角、上下午俱無軒輊、嗶嘰盤旋於六角一分一五至五厘、白貨細布津帮採辦一百數十件、本街成交三四百件、</p>
<p>出　口布疋、今日有十八件、運往香港另有十二件、運往海防、昨則另由寗波運來綢子二百零九件、</p>
<p>海　白龍又名開摩太克司、齊呼長毛絨、大商場每碼開售三十六元半、呢羢業售三十四元半至三十五元、一件女色大衣總在一百數十元、而製者仍多、</p>
<h3>糧食　粳米尚平　客秈壟斷堅俏</h3>
<p>客　尖市自日來一路上漲後、昨則漲風仍熾、緣來源旣絕、市存日稀、兼之某方從中壟斷、致市上籌碼頓感不敷、市貨授受、大都執於客販及囤戶手中、而行家手中為數殊少、故本鄉店方進貨、均須仰給客囤、而被輩素以牟利為旨、致一遇問津、即被抬價、收盤計蕪湖特尖為二十二元半、决至日尖十九元半、陳日尖亦為十九元半、較前市悉升六七角不等蘆洋尖到貨不多、去路尙佳、亦隨客尖跟高三五角、計南北幫特洋尖開二十四元半、特蘆尖二十五元三角、其外新粳破奪及變元等、因際新貨日旺之間、各區到貨絡不斷、一般作客心思較淡、大都無意多購、市面遂難振作、雖早市亦曾一度帶緊、然後即復轉平、故收盤行情與前相仿、若常銀特粳仍為三十一元半至三十一元、獨菉種密種百哥等新薄稻銷塲旣乏大胃、零星交易亦屬不暢、况到貨近兩朝無斷、市存頓夥、市面遂難立足、行情續貶二三角、收盤靑甬菉種為三十元零五角、窰種三十元、野稻三十一元、中决者三十元、楓嘉百哥高貨二十九元、斛見二十八元、回顧統市情形照客尖而論、早市雖仍一再轟動、惟近收市忽有謠傳蕪湖等地又將開禁、其後來源疎通之說、形勢轉懈、計全市所到各貨、有常崑蘇嘉楓泗靑甬等粳尖包子三千三四百包、成交數因先緊後疲、仍不過七八千包而巳、</p>
<h3>麥價昂貴　麵粉廠盤又提</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日廠盤又漲、二號粉廠盤巳喊為七元四角、較上週末提升二角、查本客銷塲堪稱活躍、本街零批、並不以廠盤增加而减縮、南北兩帮客胃、亦絡繹不絕、惟各廠以原料日昂、售意續堅、對於客銷非經接洽、不予供給、故成交反見清閒、統市的計三萬餘包、聞暗盤有七元五角半與六角之價、恐非正式市情云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市步有起色、蓋以目下各地小麥均有統制、來源日見寥落、執貨者扳持益堅、幸存底尙充、一時未能在騰、據業中人談論、最高價將看十二元者、昨市福早兩廠合辦江北浦東及常錫等麥共六千餘包、及囤戶拉進十餘車、價十一元六角八分决至九元七角三分、較前又升二三四角不等、尚有本埠白麥一而車、價須十一元八角、因其品質特高也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　白廠跌二百元</h3>
<p>昨橫濱現貨一八五〇元、遠期一八二〇元、計遠期漲十六元、紐約星期無市、本埠絲價受外匯影響、回跌甚厲、白廠ORD已跌進四千元關做開三九〇〇元、計下跌二〇〇元强、七八分白廠因之未能售開、諒外銷絲市、將入黯淡途中、印號白土絲昨略有成交、價一二〇〇元、尙稱平穩、計做開十五担云、出口絲經運往香港一千包、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖隨外匯升沉</h3>

<h3>市况彙誌</h3>
<p>貼現最低卅八　昨匯劃票據貼現率、每千元上午初仍做四十八元左右、俄即不支、現鈔充斥、午刻退至四十二元、下午更傾跌至最低三十八元、終於回上二元、最後四十允、比上週六再軋小八元、錢業公會拆息勿更、早午兩市均一角八分云、</p>
<p>瓜子產價升、今庚歡收產價、迭見上漲、昨據鋼山函訊、又升二三元、濟魁子為五十二元、濟中子五十一元、徐大片子五十元、徐魁子四十七元、土山子四十元至三十八九元、申市亦甚堅挺云、</p>

<p>黃豆到少續漲　昨日黃豆因崇明及沙黃來源受阻、故蕪湖豆巳開至十四元五角、成交二百包、南京豆三百包、價為十三元五角、南翔豆一百餘包、價為十四元一角、太倉豆七八百包、價自十四元四角至十四元五角半、丁家州豆一百餘包、價為十四元四角、豆子今日有二千零八十包、運往香港、另有生油一百件及五百十聽、亦運香港、</p>
<p>烟煤易岑寂　廠方需要亦少、同業以月底將屆、現款不易籌劃、祇少數做開、印度塊每噸一百〇八元、散戶放出便宜三五元不等、但亦無人承受、開平塊較見生色、頭號塊每噸八十元、二號塊七十五元、浦西棧房車貨、行摃另加、</p>

<p>先天的精神遺傳之原因，當然可使人衝動的為此不自然的自凟，但此係少數；多數的手淫，均因頑劣或神經不健全的幼童互相傳習而成，彼此相傳，如火之燎原，甚有全班之學生，同居之靑年，無一不染此惡習者，此外過於堅小的褲子，木馬遊戲，脚踏車等，因摩擦刺激外生殖器過甚，亦可釀成自凟，故為人父母及師長者，應注意幼童之褲襠是吾大小適合，及有無隙縫或開口處，以免其隨時自凟，餘如過久的坐椅，過度的與奮工作，過多的飮食，被褥過暖等，皆可使生殖器充血興奮以至手淫；故不應使幼童早睡而晏起，過長的包皮，肛門內寄生蟯虫，外生殖器不潔，或有其他皮膚病，大便秘結，尿液異常等，均可發生癢的感覺，於是因摩擦而手淫，此外一切足以引起性感覺之事物：如淫書，淫畫，裸體像等，均可使靑年人性神經興奮，而為不自然的自凟。故於發育時，不論任何靑年，必須隨時防止自凟，以免損害健康。</p>
<p>抑有進者，犯自凟之人，一旦結婚之後，定必縱慾無度，致生殖機能病變百出，如腎虧不育，早衰陰萎，腰狻背痛，接踵而生，痛苦愈甚，生趣索然，為求健康計，靑年時代，不宜自凟，以余治療的經騐而論，遺精滑精，可以「耐而斯遺精片」治之，神經衰弱，腎虧早洩，婚後不育，服以德國畢丸精質製劑男用「補體康」最為對症，蓋市上雖有以同樣製劑號召病家，然佳者不多，多數為變相之春藥，或類似春藥之補劑，唯有「補體康」一藥，為眞正之雄壯動物睾丸精素製劑，具有調經種子，治貧血早衰之功用，不論男女學生，若因神經衰弱，學業减退者，可速以「補體康」補救之，允其自瀆嶄傷，精血虧損，一服該劑，立呈返老還童之象。</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>併發症之特治</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>淋病之可以根本治愈，實為科學家所昭示者。然而何以淋病不能根治之呼聲，聒人耳鼓。其實此等人對於實際上之淋病眞相，了無所知，徒知一唱百和。於是患淋病者，無時不處於悲觀之空氣中，而聽任可惡之淋菌蔓延滋長，險症百出，此實對於淋病無新認識，而祇囿於籍觀念中，更以落伍治表法，如宣稱三五天可以治愈。一斑新問世之成藥，實際上之效果，多與一般過去無聊之成藥相等。原來狡猾之淋菌，狼奔豕奔，行止無定，故症象變化多廢，非有十分之經驗，完全之設備的醫家，不能劍別而治療之。所以一般表面化與局部化的藥物與手術，均無濟於事。而必須具有包圍淋菌，直接置淋菌於死地之療法，始克有濟於事。</p>
<p>由於前述種種之理由，德國淋病學大師彼德博士，卽首先根據淋毒非特異療法之原理，發明用蛋白體黃色素混合製成之「克淋濃」一藥，曾經用天竺鼠等動物試騐，逐步改良，卒獲圓滿之結果，不論新老白濁，祇須服「克淋儂」數小時後，其殺菌功效，卽由血液中發生，使各細胞亦起抗淋噬菌作用，故由淋菌所發生之炎腫，小便澀而不暢，淋系淋點，膿血交織之種種痛苦，卽可消退，允其是淋菌由兩種以上之合併症，服「克淋儂」有同時治愈之效能，此為「克淋儂」特有之功效。而非其他劣藥所可望其項背，並已獲歐美各大花柳病院，一致承認為淋病特效藥，故紛紛在各大花柳病雜誌上闡揚本劑功效之經過，足證本劑功效之卓越也。</p>
<h3>痰中帶血</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>患者王雨靑，年三十三歲，安微巢縣人，（自訴）本人好酒色，於前年冬患咳嗽之症，此時未經醫治，直至去秋，咳嗽不止，胸感刺痛，而濃痰甚多，每於淸晨，痰中帶有血點，由是憂急萬分，入夜常有盜汗。乞治云云。余觀王君熱度甚高，面色蒼白，以X光檢騐，發現右側肺葉一胡桃大小之空洞，卽囑其在家靜養，攝取富有滋養之食品，並積極購服『補肺拿爾』，王君遵余言購服結果，一月後咳嗽巳止，食欲巳增，二個月後，濃痰已少，盜汗已無，服至今諸症全消痰中帶血已無發現，已身體壯茁，健康恢復矣。</p>
<p>遺精治愈例　德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>遺精青年因婚期迫近　及其迅速療法之功效</p>
<p>患者謝世良，浙江海門人，年二十五歲，居本埠法租界菜市路，（自訴）—十六歲時，求學於霞飛路某中學，因受同一宿舍年長同學之引誘，而犯目凟之惡癖，初因不覺其弊害，故每夜為之，以洩精為快，其後身體日見消瘦，時有頭昏，健忘等症，對學業不感興趣，難服補劑，絕無效果，後自凟雖已知害戒絕，而有夢遺發現，起初每月有二三次，後漸次增加，竟每星期有二三次之多，並時有滑精現象，現因婚期迫近，特此未治云云。（現在症象）—精關不固，內分泌枯竭，性器短小，腦神經衰弱。（治愈經過）——令其淸心寡慾，每日睡前以冷水摩擦局部，服「耐而斯遺精片」，及大量之男用「補體康」，謝君遵余言而行，二星期後，遺滑巳無，一個月後，健康恢復，身體日見壯健。</p>

<h3>淋病療法之秘訣</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路</p>
<p>九四川路口</p>
<p>在舊社會尙未完全毀滅，禮敎滓渣依然存在的今日，對於淋病，大多猶諱疾忌醫，於暗中偷偷摸摸用市上一般劣藥，或向一般低價包療，設備不全之市醫治療，結果大多失敗。惟共時如能瞿然然覺醒，翻然改圖易轍。用有效之療法，始克收根治之效。以吾人日常經歷，淋病初起，並非難治，而其終於成為難治者，大多由於初起時不知此病將來有莫大之後患。且將淋毒傳染妻子，使妻子之白帶增多，故雖一方獲治愈，然每因房事之接觸，因而重復發生，如此一來，豈非等於前功盡棄。何况要想治愈一方之淋病本屬難事呢？山於病情之複雜，治療上之需要，非速治不可，萬一急性淋時期已失去治療之機會，而轉入慢性，並傳染妻子者，非速行同時治療不可。此卽淋病根治法之秘訣也。願病家再三留意之。</p>
<p>現在且談治療的方法，以余二十年之經騐，舉凡市上一切流行之成藥及電療等均無不一一試用。就中以淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，確為內服藥中之冠。而德國靜電療法及X線電療，則為一切淋病理學療法中的中堅。一方又用德國抗淋血淸，則不僅游泛於血液，匿竄於關節的淋菌，無不一網打盡，而頑固難愈，變症多端的淋病亦可徹底治愈。如婦人已染淋毒者可同時外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥允佳診時上十時至下午六時每天送診甘號每號僅取號金五角並贈「性病全書」一册。</p>

<h3>越界築路交涉　將先商警權問題　英美領對方案已加研究　工部局開會不提出討論</h3>
<p>工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥、與警務處總巡所擬之解決越界築路具體辦法、起草就竣、已誌昨報、昨據工部局某董事談、就目前趨勢而論、工部局方面所擬之解決方案、不久即將向偽市府提出、不致提付下月一日之董事會討論、因英美董事、在會外巳經縝密接洽、有所決定、似不宜提付董事會議公開討論、以引起中日董事之即席爭執、聞工部局方面所擬之方案、與前上海市長俞鴻鈞及工部局總裁費信惇兩人所商談者大致相同、第一步先解決警權問題、工部局當放棄一部份之權利、至捐稅問題、暫時不談、矣將來再行討論、</p>
<p>滬西各路　昨日一瞥</p>
<p>越界築路區域、上周所呈緊張狀態、日來已漸形消弭、大中社記者昨日赴該區巡視時、見曹家渡一帶、捕房方面之防務、較前略見鬆弛、憶定盤路愚園路口及憶定盤路大西路口英軍所築之堡壘內、均有英軍荷槍駐守、一切情形、尙稱平靜、惟愚園路上自前晚起、偽警巡邏隊突形增多、每隊數十人、往來頻繁、康腦脫路勞勃生路延平路等處、仍有中西探捕、檢查行人車輛、並有三號五號裝甲車、不斷在該地帶巡邏、至哥侖比亞路·安和寺路·一帶、凡偽警布崗地點、捕房均派有探捕在旁駐防、英軍則乘坐巡暹車兩輛、每輛四名、上架設機槍、不分晝夜、往來遊弋、海格路直至徐家匯陸家路等處、戒備情形、與往日相彷彿、</p>
<p>難童中學　照常維持</p>
<p>上海市私立難童初級中學校昨函本報云、『逕啟者、日前貴報所載越界築路事件內記載極司非而路十一號三十一收容所及難童中學被迫遷移一節、與事實略有出入、有勞學生家屬及關心本校之人士或函電垂詢、或親駕慰問、敬將詳實情形、報吿如下、按本校在暑期中、自建竹廬於極司非而路盛氏宗祠洋房後面之空地上、八月底遷入開學、嗣因第三十一收容所遷讓房屋、於本月初、該所難民全數、暫住本校各級敎室及其他另屋、當時本校仍在膳堂·辦公室·會客室、繼續上課、自本月二十八日起、三十一收容所難民陸續遷至惇信路第一收容所、木校恢復原狀、想本校係救濟失學失養靑年之學校、而善團之給養及敎費、現仍照常撥付、對此地主屋後空地無妨礙情事之下、總能維持此滬上唯一之難敎機關也、茲為免滋外界誤會起見、用特奉吿如上、」</p>
<p>偽警能力　至為薄弱</p>
<p>大陸報云、據目擊者言、今日（三十日）淸晨一時甫過、有本市某著名汽車公司出租之汽車一輛、疾馳而過憶定盤路愚園路口、車中人突自車窗向駐守該路口之「大道」警察開槍射擊數響、偽警聞槍聲、立即離崗位而遁、往附近房屋躱避、汽車則繼續疾馳而去、事後並無傷亡、車中人數、未能確悉、　又據另一報吿云、滬西區「大道警察」、於昨晨一時與三數携有槍械之匪徒、在汽車中雙方開槍、據悉有本埠著名汽車公司之汽車一輛、駛近愚園路憶定盤路口、其時正淸晨一時、車內究有若干人數不詳、而「大道警察」則正在附近一帶巡邏、喝令停止、旋即雙方開火、車內匪徒出窗口向「大道警察」開槍、聞汽車身部受有槍痕、後即逸去、</p>
<h3>四郊日軍　深夜出防　華軍漸進逼　日緊急戒備</h3>
<p>上海四郊、謠豚繁興、鄰近各縣華軍、日漸向市區緊迫、形勢緊張、一若戰事之迫在眉睫、浦東一帶、因傳有便衣份子潛伏其間、備作內應、向例晚間日軍一律歸隊不出者、今則每晚十時以後、海軍陸軍全副武裝、出動各要道、架設機槍、作緊急戒備、澈夜不得安寗、直至天明始行撤退、</p>
<h3>今日十底比期　長期信用款總結束　計放款成交數不多</h3>
<p>上海各滙劃錢莊業務、以信用放款為主、長期放款名曰「六對、」每年四月底十月底、為開始及結束之期、今日為十底長期之唯一總結束期、所有應須歸納之存放各款、咸於咋市作大規模之總決定、各莊對到期之款允通融展期、並允儘量辦理新放款、但今年之十底、與戰前大不相同、到期之款亦不如遠去之巨、新放之款成交不多、故十底僅為歷史上之過去名詞、故銀根依然毫無緊張之象、</p>
<p>通融展期　另立借據</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向錢業探悉、四十一家匯割莊對到期之款總的一千萬元、其信用素佳之老戶口頭、均予通融展期、除淸償全部到期利息外、另訂新借據、期限自一個月至六個月不等、</p>
<p>新信用款　成交不多</p>
<p>關於新信用放款各莊允儘量貸放後、經各工廠公司行號與各莊接洽之結果、聞十底成交者總的有一二百萬元、息價自九元至十二元不一、廠方為最多、的百萬兀、其餘綢緞北貨糖業等均有、至於漢口及寗波方面各莊、向亦在上海貸放信用長期款、惟戰後停止貸款、對於前放之款設法收回、所以今年之十底、甬漢各莊均無新款做出、僅老戶頭轉賬而巳、的有二百萬元、</p>
<p>長期存款　分別結息</p>
<p>各莊對於長期存款、均根據內盤行市再行分別加價、今年之十底內盤為五兀五角、各莊之加價自五角至二元不一、是項存息、均結至十底為止、至於中中交農四行、為救濟市面、儘量辦理貼放、惟是項放款以抵押為主、絕無信用放款、至十月底截止、放款餘額、的有一千六百餘萬元、其中百分之八十、由該會直接貸放、百分之二十、由銀錢兩業凖備會庫轉手、旨在調劑各行莊之金融、</p>
<h3>蘇州河北甲區　形勢趨嚴重　日憲兵會同華籍「憲佐」　密怖崗位施行緊急戒備</h3>
<p>昨日蘇州河北甲區及鐵刺網內虹口區域、形勢更趨緊張、日憲兵總部派遣大批憲兵、會同華籍憲佐、分隊佈崗、戒備極嚴、每一小隊日憲兵的十餘人、各由一佩刀之下級軍官率領、計四川路橋堍一隊、海寗路口一隊、餘外如吳淞路·乍浦路·文監師路·靶子路·海寗路·橫洪路·狄思威路·等處、均滿佈崗位、十步一崗、五步一哨、行人車輛經過、概須加以搜查盤詰、始准通過、同時海寗路口·文監師路口·兩鐵絲網缺口、對行人進口、查騐派司、益較前嚴緊、據大光社記者探悉、日方採取上述緊急戒備原因、聞係防止抗日份子混入滋事、另一傳說、則謂華軍游擊部隊迫近滬郊、日偽方面感覺極大恐慌、故在區內實施緊急戒備措置、</p>
<p>過橋手續　麻煩異常</p>
<p>大中社云、通入虹口閘北之特殊區域、有下列幾座橋樑、其通行規則、各有分別、如外白渡橋·四川路橋·可准車輛與行人通過、其通行時間、自上午五時起、至午夜二時止、裹白渡橋·與新閘橋、則僅准行人通過、其通行時間、為上午五時起、至下午八時止、烏鎭路橋則僅准車輛駛過、其通行時間與上述二橋同、各橋之中部、英日駐軍面面相對、外白渡橋與四川路橋、日軍日捕與英軍英捕華捕允見增多、新閘橋與烏鎮路橋除日軍之外、尙有偽軍數名、行人經過其間、須行禮呈騐通行證及物品、其手續之麻煩、無異進入異國境域、</p>
<p>界路以北　景象荒涼</p>
<p>北河南路底英軍崗位、與界路北之日軍崗位遙遙相對、由寶山路轉入福生路之處、一日人正在指揮數華人拆屋、界路之鐵絲網、自寳山路起、直攔至北浙江路、鐵絲網之東、租界巡捕往來巡行、鐵絲網之北、則有日軍駐守其間、彈痕纍纍之兩路管理局、巳為日軍鳩居、彈洞及破敗之窗門、檔有木板、西望早橋、則絕無行人、</p>
<p>蔓草業中　日軍崗位</p>
<p>北西藏路開封路口、有一英兵駐崗、泥城橋畔亦有一英兵駐崗、當記者行經該處時、見有一卡車駛至該處、將食物送至英軍崗位之小屋內、緣該處有一小隊英軍、常川駐守、自泥城橋起至北西藏路底止、鐵絲網密密圍繞、鐵絲網之西、一望荒凉、斷垣殘壁之外、悉為蔓草蜿蜓、而日軍崗亭、則築於此蔓草叢中、亭以舊磚焦木搭成、記者遙見二日軍作對語、秋風蕭瑟、野草變色、亦為古戰塲憑弔歟、</p>
<h3>物價飛漲　創最高峰　各業設法平抑　迄未達到目的</h3>

<h3>日軍屍灰　—五十三批—</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日軍官兵在華中陣亡或傷重與患病身死者之屍灰一批、於昨（二十九日）晨運抵大連汽船會社之楊樹浦碼頭、由日運輪艦一艘、載返日本、上海日僑成人與學童麝集該碼頭致敬、據日文報紙載稱、此為中日戰爭爆發後第五十三批載返日本之日軍屍灰、</p>
<h3>日軍在楊樹浦　佈警戒綫</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日軍今（三十日）晨在匯山路與麥克利克路間之揚樹浦路上佈警戒綫、阻止車輛行人經過、蓋有日本某親王經該區登輪返日也、至午前十時四十五分、始准交通恢復常態、按該親王顯係來滬視察戰區者、昨日（二十九日）抵埠時、日軍會作相類之戒備、但該親王抵滬與佈警戒錢、事前無通吿、</p>
<p>中政府在交通方面，繼續作最强有力的努力，因為中國在軍事政治和經濟上都需要更多的鐵路，更多和更好的汽車路，和河道航運的改良，近幾個月來在這方面已大有進步。法國自海防到昆明的鐵路運輸能力，已較一年前廣州與漢口相繼淪陷時，增加四倍。交通力雖猶亟需大加增强，然而這法屬鐵路所已完成的功績，却有熱烈祝賀的價値。不遠的將來，「自由中國」將有另一條通越南的鐵路交通綫。</p>
<p>廣西各新鐵路，今在迅速進展中。啣接越南邊界上鎭南關與南寗的鐵路綫，敷設工作的進行，可望在明年初竣工。自桂林到柳州的新鐵路，本月初已開辦定期交通。自柳州到衡陽，今巳有全程交通而啣接廣西和湖南兩省的中心地，連接柳州和南寗的廣西最後一條鐵路，正在建造中，塡土工程，巳多完成。</p>
<p>雲南省的鐵路敷設，也在前進着，中政府暫巳放棄沿滇緬公路全程建造鐵路的計劃，而集中努力，敷設自昆明沿雲南中部山脈北緣到下關的鐵路·這一段工程比較容易，而將使目前在昆明經中途的下關而到臘戍間公路上忙碌行駛的整個交通工具，都能集中在臘戍和下關之間。擬定啣接昆明和北方叙府的路綫，也在着手進行建造，但近來所注重的，是向北去不達叙府而到瀘州的新汽車路的完成，本月初業已竣工，按期通車，由法國某銀行團組織，所用法國新式蘭腦卡車，不下五百輛。</p>
<p>中政府為顯明的原因，已不再准許刊佈關於「自由中國」工業發展的消息，但近來這種消息的缺乏，不應認為是「自由中國」境內創立新工業和重設舊工業正在寬弛的微象，實在近幾個月來擴展軍火和金屬工程的工廠，和開採煤鐵鑛砂方面，又有巨大進步，供這些目的之用而輸入的機械，佔「自由中國」入口品的重要地位。私人實業，大多致力在食物和紡織業的設立。新辦的工業合作社，雖還沒得到可與正式實業相比擬的重要性，卻在使人滿意地發展著。工業合作社現在雇用工人二萬五千名以上，分派在六百多所工業合作工塲裏工作，這些工塲，有若干所已臻大規模實業的範圍和生產力，例如其中一所，每週能製輕機關槍二百挺。（未完）</p>
<h3>海關水巡捕房　將接管浮碼頭　原為工部局掌警務權　此後由水巡捕房接代</h3>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>抽思剝見錄</h3>
<p>— 識强</p>
<p>一、濾</p>
<p>心頭上忽然長起一叢亂草，荒蕪，彷彿又像是滅沒；找不出一段小徑，失望！</p>
<p>可是鼓勵的火把，鑲渚希望的閃燄，投射過浮起的沉渣，照得壁角落裏織塵畢露；這些，讓它隨着大江東去」；回頭再來迎，迎那個「捲土重來」</p>
<p>這裏把死的「思索性都抽去，包抄，進剿，放火而且希望它燎原；把心板上蕩成一塊「不毛之地」，隨後築起亂牧患的防綫來。</p>
<p>抽思原來為剝見，想把新苗抽出來，也許還要和內疚火迸。然而究竟剝去了一層或多層，不但自己認為茫然，誰都不曾答覆這個多樣性的懸案。</p>
<p>算了罷！「釜底抽薪」不好麽？把鼎沸的熱腸來止住。不——這不是抽薪所可止得牢的</p>
<p>那些抽去的思，能够多了幾層，也許會把偏狹之見，以至乖謬和妄誕，加速度地遞嬗蜆變；剝去一層兩層，剝到「成見毫無」，剝到「虛懷若谷」；剝到龐然的駱駝也穿過繡花針眼。</p>
<p>或者人類早就安排下一個十分妥貼而且十足昏憤之「範」，這不但不能作消極的不「就」，而且還要有待於多方面的抽抽剝，雖然奏凱的喉嚨沒有拉開，而功利的在濤又那麼侵蝕了地壳！</p>
<p>二、土日</p>
<p>起初看到土，那不過是一種灰暗色的東西罷了。平疇，立體，堆得滿坑滿谷地，更飄來一陣不大好聞的氣息；在人類的口角邊，在新的舊的紙堆裏，找到「糞土」的兩個够卑夷的形容詞！</p>
<p>進一步吧，或者可吾耐性一點，看見沒有？一粒粒種子翻個身，這原屬够平常的一件事。淺嘗！淺嘗！連這些話也說說，配登大雅之堂嗎？</p>
<p>平凡的極致，也許新奇隨後而來；當你第三决看到的時候，事實吿訴着這當中做着「物競」的功夫，擺着一架汰粃存華的天平秤，用兩爿極其渺小的葉子，抬出一塊「十年樹木」的招牌。</p>
<p>够了——不，政治家聚首來商量，開國三要件，一件，又一件，還有這一大片雖有扛鼎之力也不能撼動的「土地」</p>
<p>唉！道話說得太晚了一點，不是已經被在風捲去了一層嗎？不是已經焦了嗎？</p>
<p>也許，捲者刮之極，焦者熟之精；活該！與其說「人類相斫」，母寗說「土命重新」。一千一萬的人，走過去，沒有留意這些灰暗而無香味的東西；這回，就是這回，那些焦的，浮的，或者是小塊的，大塊的，窟窿的，墳起的以至於成批的或者頹垣下巳經變成赭色的，組成一部人們所不能寫得那麽親切的「唯土論」！</p>
<p>這一部大著裏，第一章開宗明義，便是闡述「中原重新製造好土地」！</p>
<p>看！濃烟四起，那是提煉的工作吧。</p>
<p>捲去浮土，精華常存；就是焦了而老農往往說這麼幾句頗足玩味的話，雖然那是一點沒有夾雜旁的意思的。</p>
<p>「土不燒，蟲豸不滅，作物且不容易收穫；熟土比較生土好種植。」</p>
<p>這又將怎樣來說明我們當前的行動呢？</p>
<h3>畢業晚會上</h3>
<p>— 葉菜</p>
<p>集在陝北，</p>
<p>學在公學，</p>
<p>鍜練了抗×的骨幹，</p>
<p>拿着槍桿兒試；</p>
<p>碰到×子，</p>
<p>殺他個落花飛絮。</p>
<p>陝公給三四五隊學子們畢業了，在一個月明星稀的晚上，那個廣大的山脚下，站滿了一大羣新來的，尙在學習的，和纔畢業的同學們，這是他們歡送畢業同學的盛大晚會呢。</p>
<p>幾枝暗淡的燭光，融合在銀灰的月色下，把他們映着是這麼的興奮，歡樂，還沒有振鈴開會，歌聲已飛騰起高空深谷，音調悲壯而豪放：「沒有什麼掛牽，縱或有點留戀。」母校給他們多末豐富啊，「學問總不易求得完全，只能到工作中去鍜鍊。」</p>
<p>歌聲靜時，成校長仿吾開了這盛會幕序，矮矮的個子在台上受着同學們雷聲似的鼓掌，他是來給畢業同學們作最後一决訓話的。在這裏，又培養出了這一大批抗×的幹部，又完成了一部份蔣總裁底希望的話：「以非常時期的方法來達到敎育本來目的，運用非常的精神來擴大敎育的效果，」成校長仿吾在訓話時滿面春風，一團興致。接着，毛澤東同志和康生同志先後演說了！都是畢業同學們的行動指針，讓大家出去工作時可以有個頭緒。</p>
<p>同學總會來散果食了，也就是留校同學歡送畢業同學來着游藝節目的時候。在這雪地風天中，敲胡桃，剝花生，嚼麻糖，看戲劇歌舞，誰都忘却了寒冷的緊襲。在這熱鬧的空氣裏，談笑共相話別離，體味着再會吧在前綫，為着中華民族的無雙怨，報復重壓心底，只等待明天的晨曦中號角聲起，勇力赴戰。</p>
<p>够興奮啊，在大會的蓬勃的氣氛裏：每個同志熱血都在激流，他們幾乎不能抑住了，他們的心活躍奔馳。</p>
<p>過了好久時候，他們休息了一會，在思維裏又突的晃着極度的光亮：「再過幾天，跑到戰地，要爭得最後勝利，粉身以換。」</p>
<h3>行間</h3>
<p>— 康民</p>
<p>在燈光下讀着日報。</p>
<p>週圍是這末的靜寂，窗外的秋風拍着動搖的窗玻璃。我的心坎裏却暖暖的。</p>
<p>我還是讀着我的報紙，我由這些字裏行間，聞到春天的芬芳之氣！</p>
<p>忽然，發現一隻小而黃的螞蟻，是那末忽忙，慌亂地，在報紙上橫衝直撞。我却一點也不慈悲，不經意地用我的右手的食指向這小生物的身上輕輕地一捻，這小而黃的身子立刻綣縮屈曲起來了。我只從鼻孔子裏給牠一個輕蔑的微笑：</p>
<p>「沒中用的東西！」</p>
<p>於是，我又讀起我的報紙來了。秋還是徒勞地拍打着窗櫺，我也同樣給了牠個輕蔑的嘲笑。</p>
<p>不到五分鐘，在這密排排的小號鉛字中間，却又看見那隻小而黃的螞蟻底屍體，正被在另一隻小而黃的螞蟻的嘴下啣了。這隻活的同樣是忽忙慌亂，在這密排排的鉛字中間橫衝直撞着。</p>
<p>見了這悲壯的一幕，我的心頭像受到尖椎的一刺，我痛苦極了！我反悔我剛才的那種殘忍的暴舉，我深深地厭惡起遺在我自己靈魂中的野獸般的殘暴的渣滓，對於這樣的一種小動物，怎能不呢？我並不是佛門的信徒，盲目地愛護着一切生命。但是今晚上我對於這小小的螞蟻却不得不引起我底尊敬，而要愛護着牠們的生命了！</p>
<p>我痛苦地看着這一隻口啣着同伴的屍體的小而黃的螞蟻，是那末忽忙慌亂地走開這密排排的小號鉛字的迷陣，——走出報紙，一直走向牆壁角去。</p>
<p>我目送牠們走去，我的眼睛再轉到報紙上的時候，一雙十節安然渡過，徵募寒衣極踴躍」，另有小標題：「各銀行昨代收款頗忙碌，本月底前當能募集足額」，這些個鉛字都在活躍起來了。我趕忙冉去找尋那小而黃的可敬愛的螞蟻，却巳影踪也沒有。</p>
<p>小而黃的東西在「人」的面前，是更加崇高了啊！</p>
<p>我站起來，搬開桌子上的書本子，向着灰暗的牆壁角落裏，我要我尋牠們回來，我要向牠們行我最摯誠的敬禮！</p>

<h3>巴拉</h3>
<p>— 品品譯　M·Bouchor著</p>
<p>聽我講一位英雄的故事：</p>
<p>這位英雄為了祖國犧牲他的少年。</p>
<p>他的面貌挺秀而莊嚴，</p>
<p>只十三歲，他的心與大人一樣。</p>
<p>他是一個勇敢的小騎兵，</p>
<p>馳騁沙塲，劍光閃爍，惟有前進。</p>
<p>但當他婉言寫信給他慈母的時候，</p>
<p>他又充滿一片孝心。</p>
<p>敵人衝來了。</p>
<p>他們是莽漢，無知識的人，</p>
<p>根本不知道好歹，</p>
<p>都是些混蛋……</p>
<p>這一天，正要領幾匹馬去喝水，</p>
<p>這個單身的小孩就給二十多個敵人包圍了。</p>
<p>「你的馬！」「不！」「拿來！」「放屁！」敵人氣昏了。</p>
<p>巴拉知道死已來臨。</p>
<p>但幹嗎這羣愚人</p>
<p>存心殺人而突然舉刀不下？</p>
<p>彎刀，長劍，矛子，</p>
<p>在道孩子面前搖曳……</p>
<p>這殺人羣中的一個大漢，</p>
<p>有六尺高呢，向巴拉說：「我很可憐你。</p>
<p>聽着！我們將放你走，假使你肯</p>
<p>在我們面前喊一聲：皇上萬歲！」</p>
<p>巴拉立刻想到了他的母親，</p>
<p>他很愛他慈祥的母親，</p>
<p>不安的但傲然的母親</p>
<p>正等他回去接吻啊……</p>
<p>忽然，這夾雄的孩子，</p>
<p>純潔的淮氣的眼睛中閃出明光，</p>
<p>猛力大呼一聲：「共和國萬歲！」</p>
<p>他就死在敵人的刀下。</p>
<p>靈魂高貴的小騎士呀；</p>
<p>你前面已升起了光明的日子；</p>
<p>你的犧牲正是為了</p>
<p>神聖的自由呀，</p>
<p>値得敬仰的小英雄！</p>
<p>像你一樣，我們熱愛着目由，</p>
<p>假使為了自由，需要我們的鮮血，我們的生命，</p>
<p>你就是敎我們殉國的好榜樣！</p>

<h3>環球遠東經理考察影業歸滬記</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>環球影片公司遠東經理達孚（Mr·A·E·Daff），最近曾與其夫人環游全世界一週，考察各國的影業狀况，乘便在好萊塢逗留了幾天。下面是歸來後他給影迷們的一個報吿，原載於本埠英文大美晚報，茲摘譯於下，以饗本刊讀者。</p>
<p>自歐戰發生後，美國電影事業一點不受影響，質量也並不因之减少。在</p>
<p>歐洲市場</p>
<p>上的營業是少為衰退了一些，但這種現象是不會永久的。</p>
<p>在上次世界大戰時，不論在戰區內或在戰禍所及不到地方的影業，都是一落千丈。現在則不同了。就以西班牙在內戰時來說吧，巴塞羅納雖每天數次的受到空襲，但當地影戲院仍照常維持營業，並且每塲仍擠滿了人羣，其他各地也是相同的。</p>
<p>英法兩國境內的電影院，當此次歐戰初起時，都奉令暫吿停業。現在，兩國人民都在呈請當局，除有關軍事的特殊區域外，其他各區的電影院</p>
<p>能夠復業</p>
<p>官廳方面已經批淮。講到環球本身呢。最近派了四十個攝影師駐於歐洲，乾片由紐約用飛機直接運往。所以，如今關於歐戰有什麼新的發生，在四十八小時內，就能映演於紐約的銀幕上。</p>
<p>環球公司在本年度尙欲以六百萬金元用為攝費，而狄安娜竇萍的新作“It　is—a　Date”尙未列入，估計該片又將耗去一百萬金元。其他具有同等價値正在攝製中，或巳吿攝成的有小范朋克，赫勃馬歇爾瓊裴納合演的“GreenHelI”，瑪琳黛德麗，詹姆史都華合演的“Destru”，卡萊葛倫主演的“La　Chienne”，新星葛蘿麗琴（參閱十月七日本刊的第一片“Fhe　Under　Pup”及“InvisibIe　Man　Return”，“Tower　of　London”等。</p>
<p>當達孚在好萊塢時，有許多明星向他問起</p>
<p>中國近况</p>

<p>— 南腔北調人</p>
<p>老　供奉王瑤卿將偕其女徒王玉蓉（見圖）來滬之訊，木報首先揭載，讀者信疑參半，至昨日，瑤卿果來，證實本報消息非虛。昨晨八時半，順天輪靠岸，前往迎接者除孫蘭亭吳江楓等前台重要職員外，並有黃金最高當局金廷蓀君章遏雲芙蓉草宋德珠（三人係瑤卿弟子）及吳彥衡楊寳森夫婦等若干人，九時許王等下船，下榻金公館。</p>
<p>偕與俱來者，有瑤卿女公子鐵瑛小姐，及王玉蓉劇團，金仲仁夫婦，小丑朱斌仙，花臉裘成戎，老旦孫甫亭，老生李世霖及管事李紹亭，當晚金廷蓀君特假紅棉酒家，為一行人衆洗塵。</p>
<p>按上述諸人中有親戚關係者甚衆，金仲仁為小翠花之妹倩，朱斌仙為裘盛戎之姊夫，楊寳森為王瑤卿之內姪，異地相逢，相對欣然。</p>
<p>王瑤卿有連台八本「雁門關，」從前演唱時，係金仲仁配八郞，瑤卿曾將此劇傳過兩位女弟子，蓋即章遏雲與王玉蓉，玉蓉因須露演此劇。特懇瑤卿轉請仲仁偕來，將來此劇開演，有此老牌楊八郞，定能轟動一時，（章遏雲今春演此劇，係葉盛閘飾八郎。）</p>
<p>王玉蓉三天打砲劇目，須請示瑤卿後定奪，玉蓉此來，有瑤卿為之把塲，並策一切，成績美滿，可以預下，老供奉之登台與吾，此時猶談不到也。</p>

<h3>舞女聯誼社餐舞紀</h3>
<p>— 陶馥蓮</p>
<p>大　概在二個月前，舞業婦女聯誼社會在南京路會所中招待過報界，舞聯社幾位主要人物如王琴珍倪文仙殷美鳳等的談吐，都給人以很好的印象，當時會提出怎樣募集基金的辦法，本報某君貢獻了舉行「募集基金午餐舞」的提議，就給她們採用了。</p>
<p>前天麗都舞廳在中午非常熱閙：舞孃，舞客，還有新聞記者，都集中着，人數大概在二百以上，事前並沒有做任何宣傳，全由舞女邀幾個熟悉的舞客來參加，十二時三刻，唐喬司樂隊開始奏樂，聞樂起舞，舞女立呈供不應求之勢。</p>
<p>伴舞無須舞票，祇憑一紙門券，每券十元，可以任憑和那一個舞女起舞，這方法在上海非但別開生面，而且非常有趣，這次午餐舞的收入聽說有三千多元，那末這三十餘位舞孃二小時的辛苦還算値得。</p>
<p>中間有殷美鳳的報吿，王琴珍倪文仙等的一舞聯歌」合唱，最後由吳英致謝來賓，話是說得怪客氣的。</p>
<p>這個方法，我以為可以保持下去，在必要時輪流在百樂門仙樂等舉行，好在舞聯社將收入的錢，用在舞女福利事業方面，社會的同情，該是毫無問題的。</p>

<h3>鄉寗拖西連日有激戰　後莊林家廟等地先後經華軍收復　武寧日軍已陷入華方四面包圍中</h3>
<p>Hsingchi: In the area west of Xiangning, since the 27th, fierce battles have broken out between Chinese and Japanese troops. More than 500 Japanese soldiers, divided and harassed the Linshan Temple area from Xia Maitian and Gaozu Yuan. At Yuejia Ridge, the battle continued into the afternoon, pressing towards Houzhuang. The Chinese army, taking advantage of favorable terrain, annihilated many Japanese soldiers. By noon on the 28th, a portion of the Chinese army withdrew to the highlands south of Sikang, while a strong force circled around to Xia Maitian, north and south of Liangquan, and simultaneously launched a flank attack from Bai'e, advancing on Sangjia Ling Linshan Temple. The Japanese army was thus cut into several sections by the Chinese forces, and fled towards Xiangning in different directions. Houzhuang, Linshan Temple, Xuejia Wu and other places were successively recovered by the Chinese army. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiushui: The Japanese troops in Wuning have been surrounded on all sides by the Chinese army, and their retreat has also been cut off. Fierce battles are still ongoing.

The Japanese troops in Fengxin felt deeply threatened and were extremely panicked. The Japanese attempted to reinforce, advancing from Nanliyu, attempting to halt the Chinese army's advance. However, the Chinese army has already launched a roundabout offensive against the Japanese at a certain location near Fengxin. (30th dispatch)</p>

<h3>豫北華軍　克白馬門</h3>
<h3>The Chinese Army in Northern Henan Recaptures Baimamen</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou: A force of over 600 Japanese soldiers from the Iida Brigade stationed in Bo'ai, with 17 cannons and 8 tanks, joined several hundred Japanese soldiers from Wangfeng and advanced on Baimamen Shizhang (northwest of Jiaozuo). After being severely attacked by the Chinese army, the Japanese released large quantities of poison gas, causing Baimamen to fall into Japanese hands. On the 24th, the Japanese army attacked Majiegou again. The Chinese army fought bravely and attacked the Japanese flank with elite troops. The Japanese could not withstand the attack and retreated to Baimamen. The Chinese army pursued the victory, and on the morning of the 25th, rushed into the Japanese阵, launching fierce street battles. After two hours of fighting, the Japanese could not withstand the attack and retreated to Wangfeng. Baimamen was declared recaptured. In this battle, over 300 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Chinese side suffered over 30 casualties. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>江門附近　日軍中伏</h3>
<h3>Japanese Troops Ambushed Near Jiangmen</h3>
<p>Zhaoqing: On the morning of the 29th, Japanese artillery in Jiangmen shelled Fengshan, Liucun, Shimaoshan and other places. The Chinese army suffered no casualties. At 4:00 p.m., over 300 Japanese infantry and cavalry, taking advantage of artillery cover, launched a fierce attack on the Zhongheli and Dashanding areas. The Chinese army set an ambush, luring the Japanese troops deep into the area, and then launched a fierce intercepting attack. The melee was intense. By dusk, the Japanese troops could not withstand the attack and collapsed. The Chinese army followed up in pursuit, killing many Japanese soldiers along the way. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>安陽日軍車　中伏傾覆</h3>
<h3>Japanese Train in Anyang Ambushed and Overturned</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou: At noon on the 25th, a Japanese train in Anyang, heading north to the southern end of Fengle Station, triggered a landmine planted by the Chinese army. The locomotive was immediately blown up, and the carriages derailed and overturned. The Chinese army took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. The Japanese, in a state of panic, scattered and fled. Over a hundred were killed by the Chinese, and all the military supplies in the train were captured by the Chinese army. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>五寨日軍　西犯未逞</h3>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Wuzhai Fail in Western Offense</h3>
<p>Yulin: The Japanese troops in Wuzhai attacked Sanjingzhen (southwest of Wuzhai) on the afternoon of the 5th. Due to the disparity in numbers, the town briefly fell into Japanese hands. At 2:00 p.m., Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack, engaging in a back-and-forth melee. Countless Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese could not withstand the attack and retreated. They were again ambushed by the Chinese along the way, suffering heavy casualties. When they returned to Wuzhai, the remaining Japanese soldiers had lost more than half their number. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>營田戰跡</h3>
<h3>Battle Traces at Ying Tian</h3>
<p>Miluo: Ying Tian, where Chinese and Japanese forces engaged in a heroic battle during the Xiangbei campaign, has been recovered by the Chinese army. Our reporter made a special trip to pay respects to the battlefield. Traces of the war are everywhere. More than 2,800 Japanese corpses, buried successively by the Chinese army, were found in the Wutang and Niuxingshan areas north of Ying Tian. In addition to gunshot wounds, the Japanese corpses also had knife wounds, which demonstrates the intensity of the Chinese-Japanese melee at the time. At Pailou Feng, southeast of Ying Tian, the Chinese army dug up ten Japanese artillery telephones, a large quantity of artillery shells, and other military supplies, which shows the disorganized state of the Japanese retreat. Ying Tian was once where Zuo Zongtang trained troops. The market was still prosperous, with over a thousand households. Now, the residences are in ruins and the scene is desolate. The only Yue Wang Temple in the area is also in ruins and disrepair. When the war broke out, the local villagers hid in the mountains. They have now returned and are building wooden sheds on their original sites, resuming their old occupations. According to the villagers, before retreating, the Japanese army first set fire to the remaining civilian houses on the street, and then escaped northwards by wading across the water and boarding speedboats. They followed the Japanese down the mountain and returned to the town to put out the fire. (29th dispatch)</p>

<h3>重慶各報　重視日美談話　日如不放棄現有政策　決難與美國取得妥洽</h3>
<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Emphasize Japan-U.S. Talks - If Japan Does Not Abandon Its Current Policies, It Will Be Difficult to Reach a Settlement with the United States</h3>
<p>Chongqing: People in Chinese circles here are paying close attention to the news that Japan will soon begin talks with Britain and the United States. This morning, all the Chinese newspapers had lengthy commentaries on it, stating its significance and speculating on its possible outcome. The China Army's mouthpiece, "Saodang Bao," published an article titled "U.S.-Japan Diplomatic War," stating that Tokyo is currently adopting a strategy of both threat and negotiation. The Japanese side has expressed a willingness to reopen the Yangtze River, but the U.S.'s "Open Door Policy" and Japan's "New Order in East Asia" are definitely incompatible. It is believed that the United States will insist on the basic principles of the Nine-Power Treaty during the negotiations, namely: (1) respect for China's independence and territorial sovereignty; (2) granting China the right to establish a strong and effective government; (3) maintaining equal opportunities for all countries to trade in China; and (4) no country may take advantage of China's situation to interfere with the interests and privileges of other countries in China. The newspaper concluded that if Japan adheres to the policy of the "Tanaka Memorial," there is little possibility of a settlement. "Xin Min Bao," which is a more detached outlet, wrote a commentary on the news that Britain and Japan will soon negotiate in Tokyo, stating that British-Japanese negotiations are not very important. In short, Britain is now unable to fully focus on the Far East, so it seems that Britain does not intend to thoroughly resolve the outstanding issues between Britain and Japan. Moreover, the main obstacle to Japan's program in China at present is the United States, not Britain. If the issues between the United States and Japan can be resolved, then it will not be difficult for British-Japanese negotiations to reach a settlement. However, if Japan cannot adjust its relationship with the United States, then it will not be able to exert pressure on Britain. It is believed that Japan will concentrate its efforts on negotiations with the United States, rather than urgently seeking a general solution to British-Japanese issues. Therefore, it is reasonable that the rumored negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo will be limited to the Tianjin dispute. Future negotiations between Britain and Japan will be limited to the resolution of local issues, or a partial settlement may be reached. General compromises, or a complete breakdown in British-Japanese relations, may not be possible. In other words, British-Japanese relations will remain in a "half-dead" state. Xin Min Bao said that it has heard that U.S.-Japan negotiations will begin soon, which is very important. The U.S.-Japan relationship seems to be entering a decisive stage as a result. If the negotiations break down, it is expected that the United States may take proactive action against Japan, either by continuing to aid China or by banning the shipment of arms to Japan. Japan relies on the United States for 80% of the war materials it needs. There is reason to believe that future negotiations will determine Japan's fate in China. If the United States implements an economic embargo against Japan, then Japan will be hard-pressed to hold out for more than six months. If Japan hopes to reach a settlement with the United States, it must abandon its so-called policy of establishing a new order in East Asia. As for what happens after that, only Heaven knows.

<h3>中國人民外交協會　論英美合作必要　英美如聯合與中國合作　為遠東唯一之穩定因素</h3>
<h3>Chinese People's Foreign Affairs Association Discusses the Necessity of British-American Cooperation - British-American Cooperation with China Is the Only Stabilizing Factor in the Far East</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese People's Foreign Affairs Association recently submitted a lengthy memorandum to the Chinese delegation attending the Pacific Relations Conference to be held in Virginia, United States, in November, strongly arguing that Britain and the United States must cooperate with each other to resolve the Sino-Japanese situation. Its contents state: The peace and order of East Asia was established by the Washington Conference of 1922. However, as long as the conditions stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty are not restored, there will be no peace in the Far East. We firmly believe that British-American cooperation and cooperation with China is the only stabilizing factor in the Far East. Because of the lack of cooperation between Britain and the United States, Japan was able to invade Manchuria. If the so-called New Order in East Asia is established, then the rights of the powers in China will inevitably come to an end. We hope that Britain and the United States will sincerely cooperate in the future to maintain the open door in China. Since the outbreak of the European War, the United States has become the main actor in the Far East. Japan is obviously reusing its old trick of intensifying aggression against China during the last World War. Only the United States can curb Japan's aggression in China and save the interests of all countries. The memorandum also urges the United States to impose economic pressure on Japan, saying that after two years of war, Japan's economy has been depleted and it will be difficult for Japan to retaliate against the United States. The memorandum continued that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese War will depend on the concerted efforts of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, and hopes that they will adopt the following procedures: (1) aid China and force Japan to abide by its obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty to maintain the solemnity of international treaties; (2) US-Japanese commerce will not continue if Japan does not stop its aggression; (3) implement economic sanctions against Japan and implement the resolutions passed by the League of Nations. Finally, the memorandum requested the United States to convene the Nine-Power Treaty signatories to lead the protection of the rights and interests of all countries in China, saying that China will closely cooperate with the United States in this effort based on the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty.

<h3>美修正中立法案　渝各報著論批評　此案既不利於中國　亦不能收弭戰之效</h3>
<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Criticize U.S. Revision of the Neutrality Act - This Act Is Not Only Unfavorable to China, But Also Cannot Stop the War</h3>
<p>Chongqing: All the Chinese newspapers here published the U.S. Senate's passage of the revised Neutrality Act on October 27 in large characters, and unanimously expressed their approval. The Central Daily News published a commentary criticizing the matter, saying that although the revised U.S. Neutrality Act is unfavorable to China, we endorse the U.S. Senate's actions for the following reasons: (1) The Neutrality Act can represent the basic U.S. policy of opposing aggression and promoting peace; (2) Under the current circumstances, the United States is unable to establish a law that adapts to the needs of both Europe and the Far East. Rather than causing difficulties and disputes in order to adapt to the needs of both parties, it is better to focus its efforts on one aspect. The United States can shift its full attention to the Far East after dealing with the European situation; (3) China has full confidence in the sympathy of the United States. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew's recent speech in Tokyo has proved that the United States will never ignore the Far East; (4) The idea that Japan may use this Neutrality Act to declare war on China is unfounded, especially because the U.S.-Japan relationship is approaching a decisive stage. If Japan continues its aggression, it will inevitably cause a corresponding reaction from the United States. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Communist Party's organ, Xinhua Daily, strongly criticized the new U.S. Neutrality Act in an editorial today, believing that it favors Britain and France against Germany, and therefore not only cannot prevent the spread of the European War, but instead allows the United States to indirectly participate in the European War. This will be a major blow to Germany, but it is not a way to maintain world peace. Therefore, if this bill had been established before the outbreak of the European War, it might have been able to stop the war. As for today, it has already lost this effect. Furthermore, the new Neutrality Act has made the United States an indirect ally of Britain and France. Therefore, the United States can no longer be regarded as neutral. In short, this revision of the U.S. Neutrality Act was purely instigated by U.S. financial capitalists and arms dealers. Finally, the newspaper also expressed great disappointment at the new Neutrality Act's favoring Japan and disadvantaging China. (30th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>滿蒙邊境　情勢好轉</h3>
<h3>Situation Improves on the Manchurian-Mongolian Border</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to the Asahi Shimbun's Hailar correspondent, the situation on the 5,000-kilometer border between "Manchukuo," the Soviet Union, and Outer Mongolia has improved after the conclusion of the Nomonhan ceasefire agreement. The correspondent has visited the disputed areas near Nomonhan and other places on the border, but said that it is not yet possible to be too optimistic about the future of the border. Although some of the Red Army troops who participated in the Nomonhan War withdrew after the armistice agreement was concluded, a large number of Soviet troops are still stationed in Outer Mongolia. Some of the Soviet aircraft that participated in the Nomonhan air war have also been withdrawn, but they have been transported to Xi'an, Yunnan, Chongqing, Yichang and other places. In the past three years, there have been 431 border clashes between "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union, of which 286 occurred on the eastern border, 108 on the northern border, and 37 on the western border. The western border has always been relatively peaceful, but in January of this year, the Soviet government ordered the Far Eastern Red Army to take a severe attitude toward the "Manchukuo"-Outer Mongolia border, which resulted in the Nomonhan incident. The Soviet government not only used this move to hinder Japan's military operations in China, but also to undermine the plot of Japan, Germany, and Italy to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact, and finally concluded a non-aggression pact with Germany. When the Soviet Union withdrew two divisions from the Near East from Russian territory in June and sent them to the Far East, negotiations between the Soviet Union and Germany were already underway. The correspondent concluded that it is worth congratulating both the Soviet Union and Japan that the border area is now seeing a peaceful atmosphere. However, it is unpredictable how long the current agreement will last. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>日對英美兩國　力圖調整邦交　將在東京進行會商</h3>
<h3>Japan Tries Hard to Adjust National Relations with Britain and the United States - Consultations Will Be Held in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo: It is anticipated from all aspects that talks between Japan and Britain and Japan and the United States will begin in Tokyo. It seems that Japan's central goal in talks with Britain will be to resolve pending issues regarding economic problems. If these pending issues can be resolved, negotiations will continue to adjust the overall national relations between Japan and Britain. As for the issues to be discussed in the talks between Japan and the United States, there are: (1) general issues of rights and interests in China (i.e., the Nine-Power Treaty's open door, the principle of equal opportunity, the opening of concessions on the Yangtze River and Pearl River, and other issues); (2) the issue of opening Japan-U.S. trade and navigation treaties; (3) issues of guaranteeing peace in the Pacific. It is expected that Japanese-U.S. negotiations will begin with concrete resolutions to several hundred incidents that have occurred in China. If the first negotiation is successfully concluded, the second round of talks will discuss trade and other issues. From this point of view, the success of the Japanese-U.S. negotiations to adjust national relations also hinges on whether a satisfactory understanding can be reached on the issue of a new order in China. Last autumn, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita announced that the construction of a new order in East Asia would be Japan's highest policy for handling the China Incident. Even today, this established policy has not changed. However, this greatly distances Japan from the various demands and conditions previously raised by Britain and the United States, so the prospects for negotiations are not optimistic. The Japanese government believes that making Britain and the United States understand the new order issue is a shortcut to resolving the Incident. Therefore, before the negotiations begin, the government and related parties will exchange sufficient opinions and conduct this work with Britain and the United States in advance. Foreign Minister Nomura plans to hold important consultations on this issue within this week. (30th Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued its meeting from this morning at 6:30 p.m. on the 30th. At the Prime Minister's official residence, another summit meeting was held by Foreign Minister Nomura to discuss Japan's appropriate steps and policies for dealing with negotiations with Britain, Japan and the United States. (30th Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: When Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma met with reporters this morning, he acknowledged that on October 27, two Canadian missionaries were shot by Japanese sentries in Yaolou, near Xuzhou. It is reported that one was only slightly injured, while the other was seriously injured. As for the names of the two, they are still unknown. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma made a statement to reporters this morning, saying that the Japanese government has no intention of starting formal or informal talks with Britain and the United States at the present time to resolve various outstanding issues, nor has it made any attempt to do so. He intended to dispel the impression created by the Japanese newspapers that the talks between the United States and Japan and between Britain and Japan would be held soon. Suma admitted, when answering questions from foreign reporters, that British Ambassador Craigie had met with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani and that Foreign Minister Nomura had met with Prime Minister Abe, but said that some of these talks were routine and had nothing to do with the rumors of negotiations between Japan and Britain and the United States. The spokesman also said that Foreign Minister Nomura might meet with U.S. Ambassador Grew soon to discuss routine matters, but that the purpose of this meeting was not to start formal negotiations between the United States and Japan. The spokesman also denied the rumors that the Pearl River and the Yangtze River would be opened to foreign ships soon, saying that this was just speculation. The Japanese government authorities, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have not considered such events at the moment. The spokesman finally predicted that a new regime in China would be established within a month. He believed that the establishment of a Chinese "new central government" would clarify the situation in the Far East and believed that some figures in Chongqing would eventually reunite with Wang Jingwei. Japan's established policy is to assist the Chinese "new central government" to develop steadily. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>American Neutrality Law and International Status</h3>
<p>The amendment to the American Neutrality Law has already been passed by their Senate; according to yesterday's Washington dispatch, the isolationists have conceded defeat, and the bill will likely obtain a majority in the House of Representatives as well. Regardless of the impact of the amended American Neutrality Law on the belligerent countries, the international status of the United States and the reputation of President Roosevelt will be further enhanced due to the amendment of the Neutrality Law.</p>
<p>The international status of the United States as it stands today is not accidental; every cause has its effect. Their natural endowments are abundant, not merely abundant; their environment is excellent, not merely excellent. Is it not due to the fact that their people are superior in politics and good at managing production that they can stand alone in the international community? Only by being good at managing production can their wealth and power be abundant and surpass all others in the world. This is a clear fact. Only by being skilled in politics can the Neutrality Law, which involves international interests and domestic disputes, ultimately achieve a legitimate and reasonable outcome; and the twists and turns of its process and the brilliance of the debates fully demonstrate the transformative state of modern politics. However, praising American politics with the Neutrality Law is only a small aspect; speaking of its major points: the whole country upholds public service and abides by the law, and politics always follow the grand principles and norms, so their national affairs are always in a state of balanced and vigorous progress, and their national strength and momentum are unmatched. This is the first point. They deeply understand the essence of establishing a country with good neighborliness, treating the weak countries of the New World as younger brothers, respecting their independence and freedom, respecting their sovereignty and territory, being sincere and trustworthy, benefiting them without a sense of self-importance, and never bullying or encroaching on them, let alone anything else. They advocate the Monroe Doctrine, but the weak actually receive the benefits of their protection, and everyone knows that they are not hegemonic; they do not use anti-communism or anti-Sovietism as a means of coercion, and democratic rule naturally becomes the orthodox school; they do not use military force or financial power as tools, and economic cooperation naturally tends towards common prosperity. They have never advocated the Way of the King, but they are close to it. This is the second point. Regarding Europe and Asia, they do not rely on strong interference; however, where justice lies, they uphold justice and are courageous in the face of righteousness; they are tolerant and give all kinds of sins room for self-reflection without ever perverting justice. They most recently appealed to Hitler for peace, but to no avail, so now they have amended the Neutrality Law; they once issued earnest warnings to Japan, but to no avail, so they first announced the abolition of the commercial treaty, but still gave them half a year of hesitation. The world does not doubt that they are plundering for profit and spoils, and everyone understands their intimidating righteousness, and no one dares to lightly insult them. This is the third point.</p>
<p>The United States is a democratic country; considering the meaning of misfortune and fortune being interdependent and advantages and disadvantages being consequential, there is probably not a single system or thing that can be perfect. Only by weighing the importance of things can one make choices. The same is true of American democracy. Therefore, in terms of international status, the United States has been outstanding for a long time, and its importance is now even greater. This is nothing more than the fact that under a democratic system, the president has great talent and strategy, and his character and prestige are sufficient to lead the masses. Therefore, what he has accumulated is profound, and they complement each other. It is fitting that this country and this time have this Roosevelt, and his international status is unique. The American Neutrality Law is its domestic law, a subordinate law. The existence and abolition of its clauses have been debated for more than half a year, and the merits and demerits of agreeing with me to transcend party views are not discussed here. However, the nature of this case, in international terms, is a sign of the direction of American foreign policy, and in political terms, it is related to the success or failure of President Roosevelt. If the United States were not a democratic country and Roosevelt were its leader, then he could lift heavy weights lightly and issue orders in the morning and implement them in the evening; if the meaning of the Neutrality Law were simple and its advantages and disadvantages were clear, then the public would agree and pass it unanimously. However, it is a democratic political system and coincides with divergent views. If the Neutrality Law were not of great importance, amending it or not, it could be entrusted to the legislators, then they could be allowed to approve or oppose it; if the political system were democratic and the president were timid, knowing that it was right but unable to make it happen, then it could be left to them to criticize and sigh. However, international status would be diminished. Why is that? If national affairs cannot be grasped, how can one act in the international arena? One would certainly not be feared or respected by the international community. With regard to the amendment to the Neutrality Law, the opposition's arrogance was strong, war rhetoric was easy to sensationalize, the debate was protracted, and there were many twists and turns, but it finally won the support of the majority. This could not have been achieved without Roosevelt's great talent, strategy, character, and prestige. Therefore, it is known that the United States as a democratic country cannot be shaken or divided by arguments about the identity or difference of firm and white, and the political life of Roosevelt cannot be measured. Bai Qianzhuan has the suggestion of electing Roosevelt for a second and third term as president. In the United States, the Constitution originally has no restrictions, but political history has no precedent. The matter is next year, and cannot be foreseen.</p>
<h3>German Submarines Sink Two More British Ships; Five German Ships Active in the Atlantic; Norwegian Ship Sinks in the North Sea</h3>
<p>London - Yesterday, two British ships were sunk by the Germans. One of them, the 8,000-ton Malabar, was sunk in the Atlantic Ocean by a German submarine yesterday. The Scottish engineer and four crew members from Alaska were trapped in the engine room and died. The remaining 70 crew members all landed safely. The ship was not carrying any passengers. The other ship was the 565-ton fishing vessel St. Nidan, which sank while returning from the fishing grounds. All 15 crew members were rescued. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>London - Officials have announced that the British ship "Malabar" (8,000 tons), which was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean yesterday, had 70 crew members rescued and landed somewhere in western England. One mechanical crew member and six Indian sailors are missing. (30th Havas)</p>
<p>London - The British fishing vessel "Lynx" was sunk by the enemy in the North Sea today. All ten crew members have been rescued and landed in Scotland. (30th Havas)</p>
<p>London - According to estimates by responsible officials here, the British ships sunk in the past week totaled 21,000 tons. The German cargo ships intercepted by British warships, along with their cargo, totaled 19,500 tons, which can offset each other. If we consider the losses for the month of October, the British ships sunk totaled 65,000 tons, compared to 156,000 tons last month. The losses this month have been reduced by more than half. (30th Havas)</p>
<p>London - A Norwegian ship sank in the North Sea today. The 30 crew members have landed, and three of them were injured and hospitalized. (29th Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris - The military correspondent for the Strong Will newspaper claims that five German warships appear to be active in the North and South Atlantic. Based on incomplete evidence, the five ships include the pocket battleships Deutschland and Admiral Scheer. The other three ships are the Westfalen, Friesland, and Ostmark, which were all supply ships for German aircraft operations in the South Atlantic before the war. Another German ship, the Hilfsmolte, reportedly sank the British ship Clement. It was sunk by a British destroyer a few days later. (30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Warship Inspection Procedures</h3>
<p>London - The Ministry of Economic Warfare recently issued a bulletin stating that, according to news from Belgium, the general public in that country is somewhat uneasy because ships from various countries carrying food to neutral countries are often intercepted and inspected by British warships. To dispel misunderstandings, the Ministry hereby explains in detail the inspection procedures of our warships. Any ship sailing to Belgium, as long as its cargo is limited to food and the Belgian government guarantees that this food will not be exported to other countries after it enters the country, British warships will guide it to a British port. After inspection by personnel from the Contraband Inspection Office, it can be released without difficulty. However, if these ships carry other goods (such as lead and flaxseed) at the same time as carrying food needed by Belgium, or if they are preparing to transport food to countries other than Belgium, the British Inspection Office will try to find out whether these goods and food are being prepared to be transported to Germany. Therefore, it may be temporarily detained. It is hoped that the Belgian business community will pay attention to the above measures. (29th Havas)</p>

<h3>US Senate Abolishes Arms Embargo; Soviet Pravda Says Arms Merchants Win</h3>
<p>Moscow - Pravda recently published an article entitled "The United States Cancels the Arms Embargo," which stated, "The United States Senate has passed the bill to cancel the arms embargo." This bill was strongly advocated by arms merchants. Now they anticipate huge profits from selling arms to belligerent countries and are overjoyed. "Those who support this bill use 'defending democracy' as an excuse. In reality, this move is only enough to involve the United States in the war. Therefore, more and more Americans oppose it. The public has gradually recognized the truth of the European war and believes that canceling the arms embargo will be the first step for the United States to participate in the war. "The decision of the United States Senate" is a real example of interpretation." (30th TASS)</p>
<h3>Freight Increases Between Singapore and Europe</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - According to news received here from Singapore, freight between Singapore and Europe has now increased by 30 to 50 percent. The first time was in early September of this year, after the outbreak of the European war, when freight increased by 20 percent. The second time was on September 21, when it was stipulated that freight between Singapore and Europe would increase by 10 percent. This is the third time, totaling an increase of more than 60 percent. (30th Haitong)</p>

<h3>First Batch of Soviet Troops Enters Latvia; Lithuania Thanks the Soviet Authorities for Returning Vilnius</h3>
<p>Latvian Capital - Soviet troops, in accordance with the provisions of the mutual assistance treaty between Latvia and the Soviet Union, have arrived at designated locations in Latvia to be stationed. The first batch has arrived in City of Zilupe and was immediately welcomed by the local garrison commander. (29th Havas)</p>
<p>Lithuanian Capital - After the Lithuanian army occupied Vilnius, the Lithuanian flag was raised on Gediminas Hill. Thanksgiving services were held in churches everywhere. The train between the Lithuanian capital and Vilnius was restored yesterday. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>Lithuanian Capital - Lithuanian troops entered the city of Vilnius yesterday morning. Sixty Soviet tanks have also withdrawn, but the barracks in the city are still occupied by the Red Army. The Lithuanian troops had no choice but to sleep in the open. Their commander, General Vitkauskas, is negotiating with the Soviet military authorities to ask them to vacate the premises. In addition, all houses in the city are flying the flags of both Lithuania and the Soviet Union to celebrate. At night, cafes and entertainment venues are also crowded. Food supplies, water, and electricity have gradually returned to normal. Telephones have not yet been repaired, but telegrams have been sent abroad at the request of foreign journalists. (30th Havas)</p>
<p>Moscow - Lithuanian Prime Minister Cernius recently sent a telegram to Soviet People's Commissar Molotov, which read, "As our army enters the former capital of Vilnius (Vilna), the people and government of our country are sincerely grateful to the Soviet Union beyond words. Your people and government have always strongly supported our country's struggle for freedom and independence. Recently, on October 10 of this year, we signed a mutual assistance treaty with your country and returned the former capital of Vilnius to our country. This spirit of mutual assistance will surely continue to develop according to the treaty. Today, our army's reception of the city is proof of this. On behalf of the people and government of our country, I would like to express our gratitude to your country." Molotov immediately sent a reply telegram saying, "Upon receiving your telegram, I am deeply grateful for your commendation. The people and leaders of our country are sympathetic to the enthusiasm of your people and leaders in being loyal to the country and striving for governance. As your country's former capital is perfectly returned, I would like to express our warm congratulations on behalf of your people and government. I firmly believe that the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Lithuania will surely become more cordial and thus reach a state of peace and prosperity." (29th TASS)</p>
<p>Vilnius - Stasys Šilingas, the leader of the Lithuanian residents in Vilnius, recently met with a reporter from the Haitong News Agency and gave a speech describing the situation in Vilnius under Polish rule and his personal experiences. He said, "I have been the leader of the Lithuanian movement in Vilnius for twelve years and vowed to fight for this for the rest of my life. At the Minority Nationalities Conference in Geneva, I have repeatedly protested against Poland's forceful annexation of Vilnius. Therefore, I was discriminated against by the Polish authorities. At first, I was persecuted, and then I was imprisoned. It was not until October 10 of this year, when Soviet troops entered the city of Vienna, that I learned that Lithuania and the Soviet Union were negotiating in Moscow to discuss the return of Vilnius to Lithuania. I was overjoyed and could not help but embrace my wife and dance. The joy was indescribable. Now the Lithuanian movement has begun practical work to take over the city. I immediately took the official seal of the Lithuanian Committee to take on the work. However, my good intentions caused a misunderstanding by the Soviet military authorities and I was arrested and imprisoned. I was released two weeks later with the mediation of the Lithuanian government." At this point, the Haitong News Agency reporter asked about the situation under the Polish government's rule for nineteen years. He replied, "At that time, there were 200 primary schools, 2 higher schools, and 1 teachers training school in Vilnius. In the 19 years of Polish rule, only 1 primary school and 1 higher school remained, and the rest were closed. At the same time, the Lithuanian club was also dissolved. I have now organized a committee to study the current issues in Vilnius, engage in reconstruction work, and prepare to open schools." (30th Haitong)</p>
<h3>West Belarus Merged into the Soviet Union; West Ukraine Congress Closed</h3>
<p>Moscow - The National Congress of West Ukraine held its final meeting yesterday. Representative Vestvalenko read the report of the Qualification Review Committee. According to the report, there were a total of 1,495 delegates attending this Congress, including 1,244 men and 251 women, 415 workers, 766 farmers, and 57 intellectuals. Representatives of all ethnic groups in the region were present. After the Congress passed the above report, a representative of the Red Army attended to offer congratulations. All the representatives cheered and expressed their welcome. Later, after some debate, the Congress unanimously passed the proposal to nationalize all banks and large industries. Finally, the Congress decided to send telegrams to Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, Voroshilov, Chairman of the Defense Committee, the Council of People's Commissars of the Ukrainian Republic, and the National Congress of West Belarus to pay respects. It also passed the proposal of Chairman Grinchuk to appoint a committee of 66 people to report all the proposals passed by the National Congress to the Soviet government and the government of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Then it was closed.</p>
<p>In addition, the National Congress of Belarus unanimously passed a declaration yesterday requesting the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviet of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic to "allow West Belarus to be merged into the Soviet Union and the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, so that the Belarusian nation, which has been divided for a long time, can be reunited and form a single country." (30th TASS)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to information learned here, the Supreme Soviet Council is scheduled to meet in Moscow tomorrow. At that time, the merger of West Belarus and West Ukraine with the Soviet Union will be announced. At the same time, the motions passed by the National Congresses of the two regions will be unanimously accepted. (30th Haitong)</p>
<h3>Communist Demonstrations in Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital - More than 200 members of the Communist Youth League recently held a demonstration here, shouting slogans such as "We need peace" and "We should form an alliance with the Soviet Union." The police immediately dispersed them and arrested some people. The general public did not respond to this demonstration. (29th Havas)</p>
<h3>Romanian Ambassador to Turkey Returns Home to Report</h3>
<p>Romanian Capital - Romanian Ambassador to Turkey, Toka, held talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu a few days ago. He left office yesterday and returned home to report. King Carol immediately received him and inquired about the situation for two hours. (30th Haitong)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital - News came from the Danish capital yesterday that Soviet troops had entered the Bessarabia province of Romania. Reuters immediately telegraphed TASS to inquire about the truth of the matter. TASS also replied with a denial and relayed the semi-official remarks of the Soviet Union, saying that this rumor was not only surprising but also infuriating because it could harm the current good relations between the Soviet Union and Romania. The local newspapers recently published the exchange of telegrams between Reuters and TASS, and also commented that Reuters, after obtaining surprising news, immediately inquired with the semi-official news agency concerned instead of hurriedly publishing it. This objective attitude is commendable. As for TASS's denial, it is sufficient to prove that the Soviet government has the determination to respect Romania's rights and borders, which is welcome.

<h3>German Ambassador to Italy Returns Home to Report</h3>
<p>Rome - German Ambassador Mackensen has held talks with various leaders of the Fascist Party in recent days. He left for home this morning and will submit a report to the German government on Italy's attitude towards the current war. (30th Havas)</p>
<h3>Turkish National Day</h3>
<p>Turkish Capital - Today is the anniversary of the establishment of the Republic of Turkey and the inauguration of former President Kemal. Celebrations are held nationwide. President Inonu received members of the National Assembly and the diplomatic corps in the afternoon and reviewed the garrison troops of the capital. (29th Haitong)</p>
<h3>Finland Decides on Final Answer to Soviet Demands; Representative Departs for Moscow Today</h3>
<p>Finnish Capital - Officials recently announced that "the government authorities continued to discuss the demands made by the Soviet Union with the speakers of both houses of parliament and the leaders of various political parties at 11:00 am today. They immediately drafted concrete instructions and submitted them to the cabinet for approval. It was decided that the instructions would be handed over to the national delegation tomorrow afternoon to be taken to Moscow. The content of these instructions stipulates the maximum extent to which the country can make concessions. Apart from this, there is no room for further concessions." (30th Havas)</p>
<p>Finnish Capital - The government authorities also met with the leaders of various political parties this afternoon to discuss the demands made by the Soviet Union and, after the meeting, studied the final instructions drafted by Foreign Minister Erkko, which will be taken by the delegation to Moscow to continue negotiations. Political figures here are concluding that there are still major differences between Finland and the Soviet Union, and the content of the Soviet demands is unlikely to be disclosed until the two sides reach a preliminary agreement. Someone believes that the delimitation issue near Nomonhan will be extended to the entire border between "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Soviet ambassador replied that he had not yet received detailed instructions from his government. The Soviet ambassador also said that he would work to promote friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan and establish a "peaceful situation" between the two countries. (30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>American Senate Isolationists Concede Defeat; Expect No Victory in the House</h3>
<p>Washington - Congressional isolationists conceded last night that they failed in the Senate debate on the Neutrality Law and said that they fear they will encounter the same failure in the House of Representatives next week. The administration can get a majority of ten votes, but administrative leaders have expressed in a very optimistic manner that they can estimate as much as 31 votes first. Although the isolationists have conceded defeat, they still do not abandon this last ray of hope, hoping that negotiations will be protracted. (29th Havas)</p>
<p>Finnish Capital - A demonstration was held here yesterday to express the determination of the Finnish people to defend their sovereignty and resist aggression, and to warn those with wavering will not to be misled by selfishness and cowardice. Various slogans and pictures were loaded on cars, and their content was to criticize wartime profiteering, smuggling foreign currency, fleeing abroad, and other acts that violate public interest. The masses also gathered outside the embassies of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the United States to express gratitude for the sympathy of various countries for Finland. The general public hopes that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations can be concluded within a few days. (30th Haitong)</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to Japan Departs for New Post in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to the Asahi Shimbun correspondent in Manchuria, the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Smetanin, said to the correspondent on the train when he left Manchuria for Harbin yesterday that he had decided and was prepared to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations. Regarding the Joint Border Survey Committee, the reporter asked the Soviet ambassador whether the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia had already selected representatives. The Soviet ambassador replied that the names of the Soviet and Mongolian representatives had been notified to the Japanese government. It is at this final juncture that a turning point can be achieved. Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives hope that the debate can be completed within two days and the final vote can be held on Wednesday. Republican leaders insist that in addition to maintaining the right to propose amendments to the Neutrality Law, there must be 30 hours of debate. Democratic leaders are trying to prevent the Republican plan from being realized. (30th AP)</p>
<p>New York - Thirty leaders of the Christian, Catholic, and Jewish religions advocated the abolition of the arms embargo, as stated in the statement issued today by the non-partisan committee to amend the Neutrality Law. The statement also stated that the abolition of the embargo can add America's spiritual and material strength to the side of freedom. The current Neutrality Law puts the United States in a hypocritical position of tolerating the destruction of all religions and other freedoms that mankind treasures. (30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>宋美齡對美　廣播原詞　（續前日）</h3>
<p>Song Meiling's Broadcast to America - Original Text (Continued from the previous day)</p>
<p>Chongqing: We feel our demands are reasonable because if America does not act in this way, it would be tantamount to admitting that civilization has turned to ashes, that the human spirit has vanished, and that the demon of avarice has taken the place of what the world believes in. Today, the lamentable scourge that threatens civilization has caused a new phenomenon in the world. Many people and many nations, in order to evade their responsibility, and to ensure that their economic self-preservation vessels can safely navigate the raging tide of totalitarianism, have turned their backs in cowardly ease and worshipped the demon of avarice, no longer kneeling in prayer to the God they previously acknowledged. Thus, for the sake of diplomacy, the spirit of religion is shut out, yet religion is ultimately the main pillar of civilization. Without religion, there is no international justice, no common sense of right and wrong, and all solemn promises are without guarantee. Treaties have now lost their credibility because they have lost the support of the human spirit and have forfeited their sanctity and dignity. We all know that governments driven by human desires, once intending to disrupt the world and seek power, will readily destroy those treaties that are inconvenient to them if they are divorced from religious principles. Human words clearly recorded in international documents have instantly become things without binding force, without status and value. If we want to save civilization now, we must revive the spirit of selfless courage like that of the Crusaders in the Middle Ages. We must repeatedly summon the courage to fight unyieldingly for the moral principles upon which democracy is founded. Only then can human freedom and the sanctity of human rights be preserved in the world. No country can stand for long without religion. This principle is now very obvious. If the signatories of treaties could be bound by the morality of religion, there would be no treaty violators. If those who intend to carry out destructive work have religious emotions in their hearts to awaken them, there would be no more destructive acts in the world. Those who sell munitions to aggressors who violate international laws and profit from them would stop helping others to fight if religious thoughts could penetrate their hearts, and thus there would be no aggression and no victims. Now, the Chinese people understand this meaning most deeply. We have already been practical victims of barbarism that destroys international treaties and laws. The revival of this barbarism is indeed a major stain on the progress of modern civilization. In this sacred era of 1939, this fact is clearly a painful new annotation of the modern concept of guaranteeing human rights and upholding treaties. Does the so-called guarantee of human rights not mean that everything considered a cultural characteristic, such as all religions and their revelations, return to the human world, and everyone's dealings with others are guided and bound by religious morality? Then international justice will be re-established, and at the same time, phenomena such as suspicion, partiality, deception, personal injury, and war will quickly and completely disappear. Justice will once again dominate the world and seek permanent happiness for mankind. We must restore peace and order through mutual understanding between people and between things. We women have a great responsibility. When this culture is about to collapse, when everyone is basely bowing to the god of self-interest and advancing into the abyss of degeneration, and when some people are madly using barbaric force to exterminate humanity and indulge in selfish designs, it is an excellent opportunity for us to stand up and save the world. For many generations, the progress of culture and the stability of society owe much to the valuable contributions of us women. We cannot ignore the legacy of these predecessors. We must rise up in response to the call, so as to be worthy of our lives, without hesitation, without retreat. We can only move forward. We must have the spirit of the Crusaders of ancient times, and always have that unyielding cross in front of us. If the human mind cannot have a drastic change, some of us will see with our own eyes the atrocities that cruelly destroyed China and then destroyed the entire culture. Now, only one thing can save this human disaster, and that is religion. However, the clouds of the devil still inevitably cover the light of religion. I am deeply saddened by this. In summary, when the consciousness of the country and the individual can rely on religious faith, and when human life and behavior can take religion as the pivot and driving force, then the calamity of civilization will have a turning point. Otherwise, there is no hope of salvation. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 111, stating that the entire line was quiet and uneventful yesterday. (29th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent accompanying the British troops in France recently stated that the area of the eastern French border guarded by the British Expeditionary Force has not yet seen any signs of German attack. No shots have been fired at the British line, and no enemy planes have flown over the British positions. However, the British soldiers guarding the front are always on alert, ready to strike a heavy blow upon seeing a German attack. Their work is also very hard. I saw them digging trenches in the cold and muddy areas, living a very disciplined life. At the same time, high-altitude artillery positions protecting British troops and aircraft concentration points are being rapidly constructed. In the past few days, the British National Defense Volunteer Artillery has placed artillery positions in locations overlooking the secret British Air Force base. More than one regiment of National Defense Volunteer Flying Corps has been transferred to French territory, and more will come in succession. They will all join the regular army. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: Prime Minister Daladier returned to the Ministry of War last night after a secret inspection of the Western Front. Daladier claimed that although the French troops in various places on the front line were in a harsh atmosphere and burdened with the construction of additional fortresses, their morale was quite good. According to frontline news, heavy snow has fallen in the Saar Basin, and large-scale offensives will be further delayed as a result. Yesterday, the flood situation in the Vosges River and the Rhine River remained unchanged, but the floods in the Moselle River and the Saar River have receded. Rubbish after the flood is scattered in Luxembourg and the German border. The Western Front war was very minimal yesterday. French scout teams were active east of the Moselle River and west of the Vatter Forest area. It is reported that the French army captured many German prisoners. (30th AP dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the news spread by Britain and France that German troops were concentrated outside Switzerland, the Swiss authorities have already denied it. The German News Agency, a semi-official organization here, declared that this false news was fabricated by the British Intelligence Department. Recent reports that German troops will invade Belgium and have concentrated near Aachen have also been denied by Belgian officials. Previously, the London "Daily Herald" also admitted that Britain spread the news of Germany's invasion of Belgium with "domestic propaganda as the goal." The British Intelligence Department's spread of news of Germany threatening Switzerland has already made a big mistake, because after the official denial from Switzerland, London still insisted that the news was reliable and had proof of various facts.

<p>London: This morning, air raid alerts were issued in three coastal cities and one inland city in the southeast, and were lifted a few minutes later. It is heard that a coastal city faintly heard artillery fire coming from the Strait, which subsided after several minutes. Residents of a city on the northeast coast, while on their way to the office, witnessed two planes flying very low, one of which even opened fire with a machine gun. This morning, air defense sentries sounded the alarm in the halls and corridors of the London Intelligence Department, and all personnel were ordered to take cover. A few minutes later, personnel from the Government Inspection Bureau also began to take shelter in air raid shelters. A small number of journalists continued to work as usual. Ten minutes later, personnel returned to their offices. Subsequently, it was heard that two planes had flown over a city in the northeast and flew north. It was also reported that a German plane was being chased by a British plane, and the German plane opened fire. No alarm was sounded at the time, only a readiness signal was issued, and the people stood in the street, looking up at the air battle. An alarm was mistakenly issued in the Holborn area of London, causing thousands of people who were working to rush into public and other air raid shelters. The alarm was lifted after a quarter of an hour. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Luxembourg: It is heard that there was large-scale air force activity over the cities of the Moselle and Saar regions this morning. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to today's military newspaper here, the war in northwestern Europe has virtually come to a standstill due to heavy rain. Because the front-line troops cannot move, they only conduct mock battles for recreation. Also, the rain on the Western Front has lasted for several days. German soldiers now have to wade through water, and it is extremely cold at night. Air force activity has also come to a standstill due to the bad weather. (30th AP dispatch)</p>
<p>London: An air raid alert occurred in some places along the coast of Kent this morning and was immediately lifted. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>一週來　歐戰形勢</h3>
<p>European War Situation in the Past Week</p>
<p>Paris: Semi-official sources recently commented on the war situation in the past week, saying that the weather on the entire front is bad, and the war has almost completely stopped. Only scout teams are sent out by the enemy and our army to move around. Yesterday, the enemy engineering team attempted to build outposts near the Bris River in the Saar region, but was repelled by our army, leaving behind many tools and military equipment. The enemy is still concentrating in the rear. Although the weather had cleared up by yesterday evening, we still have to wait for several days before large-scale military operations can be carried out. Berlin had issued statements at the beginning of last week, saying that the war situation would have drastic changes immediately, but it has not yet been realized, probably due to the bad weather.

<h3>戰時歐洲進行曲（續）　倫敦特約通信</h3>
<p>Wartime European March (Continued) - Special Correspondence from London</p>
<p>— Shu Di</p>
<p>(V) The Road to War</p>
<p>Yesterday's Times published an important editorial entitled "This is One Man's Crime." The content holds Hitler solely responsible for inciting this war. The British government's declaration of war against Germany, already published, also emphasized and blamed Hitler's repeated breaches of faith, which finally led to the war. Walking on the streets of London, you can immediately see the wanted posters of Hitler, specially printed by the Daily Mirror, pasted all over the streets and alleys. On it is printed a recent photo of Hitler, with the explanation: "So-and-so, from such-and-such place, 51 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall, short mustache, hair parted, a lock of hair often hanging in a ring shape on the forehead, wearing a brown shirt..." and so on. Then, a list of charges is listed one by one, such as: "Murderer of humanity", "Main culprit in the Austrian case", "Butcher of the Poles", ... and so on. Then, in large letters, it is explained: "This criminal is extremely evil and extremely cruel. Anyone who encounters him can kill him without mercy", and so on.</p>
<p>Under these various propaganda explanations, every British person walking on the street, if you talk to him about this war and mention the causes of the war, he will immediately tell you: "Hitler!"</p>
<p>Indeed, if we recall what Hitler said in his book Mein Kampf, and then compare it with Germany's outward expansion in recent years, the degree of compliance is really alarming! It is just like when we read the Tanaka Memorial and then look at every step of Japan's invasion of China in recent years. The current problem is: according to Mein Kampf, Germany's expansion is endless. At its extreme, it is as a famous diplomat here said not long ago: either Germany dominates the world, or Germany is defeated. Therefore, here, we cannot help but have the following warning floating in our minds, which was so clearly written by Madame Tabouis, a famous French political commentator, in her book "Extortion and War" last year: "Today's crisis in Europe and the whole world does not lie in the genuine expansion of the power of the aggressive group of countries. The power of the peace and anti-aggression group of countries is much greater than theirs combined. The real crisis lies in the complacency and ulterior motives of the authorities of certain major countries in Europe. In this military and economic power of the aggressive countries, which is constantly accumulated by this side's concessions, once it reaches a certain degree, then the real crisis of the world will come."</p>
<p>In the past two years, last year and this year, Europe has experienced more than a dozen so-called "crises" of war. It seems that with Germany and Italy in a state of constant mobilization (it is generally estimated that Germany has 2 million people in constant mobilization; Italy has more than 1.5 million), a European war may break out at any time and anywhere. However, as long as we go one step further to see, then you can immediately feel it; this series of "crises" is really getting more serious than the previous one. Every time a "crisis" passes, the arrogance of the aggressive country is even more fierce than before in the next "crisis", and the possibility of war is also greater than before. For example, on the eve of the Czech incident last year, most German soldiers opposed Hitler and the National Socialist Party's adventurous actions. Therefore, at the time when the war seemed imminent, the then Chief of Staff of Germany, Beck, suddenly resigned. And in the Czech incident in March this year, even the soldiers agreed with Hitler's adventure. This time, in the Polish incident, before the German-Soviet pact was signed, a group of German soldiers opposed the use of force against Danzig. Therefore, before Ribbentrop flew to Moscow, Hitler's personal final decision had been constantly swaying back and forth between the disputes between the soldiers and the National Socialists: it was not until Ribbentrop flew back from Moscow with the Soviet-German non-aggression pact that Hitler made the final decision to attack Poland! Hitler's biggest principle this time is still a so-called "lightning-fast" blitzkrieg, planning to resolve Poland in a few weeks (maybe four, maybe two). Therefore, it is said that this time, as of now, he has transferred more than one million troops to the front line and ready to be used in the East battlefield. It is said that German soldiers had some differences of opinion with Hitler on this point; the former believed that it was very risky to transfer such a large number of troops to the Eastern Front under the situation of confrontation between the Western Front and Britain and France. And Hitler, the big premise is that he does not believe that Britain and France will launch a large-scale offensive. Secondly, even if Britain and France attack at the same time, he is prepared to fight. We must pay attention to; this is a big change! In Mein Kampf, he attacked Wilhelm II for fighting on the Eastern and Western fronts at the same time in the previous war; and now, he has surprisingly become so confident that he is willing to fight on the Eastern and Western fronts at the same time. What does all this mean? It is explaining that Germany's determination to wage war is increasing day by day. So, where is its root? Very simple, it lies in its continuous geometric accumulation of strength day by day.</p>
<p>All this also points out a clear trend for the future; in case Germany succeeds in Poland, its determination to fight in the future will be ten or a hundred times greater than it is today; and at the same time, the possibility of defeating it will also be relatively reduced. Therefore, the authorities of Britain and France, although facing an enemy that is almost twice as powerful as at the "Munich Conference" last year, did not compromise and fight at that time, but now they do not compromise and come to fight!</p>
<p>This is what is called "Down with Hitlerism!" which is noisy for a while in Britain today.</p>
<p>Did the "Munich Conference" promote peace or promote war? At this time, there is already a very clear answer.</p>
<p>I can't help but think of what Madame Tabouis said at the welcome party when she came to London last December: "The decision to oppose or support the attitude of the Munich Conference does not lie in whether the individual is against or in favor of peace or warlike by nature. Speaking of which, I personally am probably more opposed to war than Mr. Chamberlain, for a very simple reason; I have two sons, and when a war breaks out, they will both go to the battlefield, which is certainly what I least want to see. But the focus of the problem is how to prevent the outbreak of war. On this point, my ideas are completely different from Mr. Chamberlain."</p>
<p>Let's look back at the past a little further: there, starting from Japan's invasion of Northeast China in 1931, the Italian and Abyssinian War, the Spanish War, the Sino-Japanese War, Germany's annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia, Italy's annexation of Albania, and now, Germany has begun to attack Poland, and at the same time has fought with Britain and France. Step, step, and step again... one step leaves a bloodstain, and another step leaves an even bigger bloodstain... In every step, Britain and France could clearly use the League of Nations as a tool to collectively stop them, but finally they compromised, acquiesced, and even encouraged them, but unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, they faced Britain and France themselves. In this way, the road to this war was formed. (September 4)</p>

<h3>最近半年間　東亞商務之鳥瞰　昭然　瑞士特約通訊</h3>
<p>A Bird's-Eye View of East Asian Commerce in the Last Six Months - Clearly - Special Correspondence from Switzerland</p>
<p>East Asian commerce in the first half of 1939 (Republic of China Year 28), compared with the first half of the previous year, shows a slight improvement in the overall calculation. However, if we look at the situation in various places separately, there are great differences in terms of increase and decrease. The reasons for the increase and decrease are specifically pointed out as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Factors that promote the prosperity of commerce: The US market situation is better than in previous years, first; the high prices of rubber and raw silk worldwide, second; the large-scale export of rubber to Europe and the United States, third; the sharp increase in the import of Japanese machinery and military supplies to the four northeastern provinces, fourth.</p>
<p>(B) Factors that hinder the prosperity of commerce: The war on the East Asian continent has not ended, first; Japan is exerting all its efforts to cut off other countries' commercial exchanges with China, second; Japan's manufacturing capacity is declining due to the impact of the war, making it impossible to export to other countries, third; the decline of all kinds of businesses in the Philippine Islands, fourth.</p>
<p>As for the general situation of import and export in the first half of this year, there are the following monthly average statistics:</p>
<p>In the statistical table, Japan is listed first, and it is inevitable that Japan and the occupied areas are confused and there is an error of "double counting." However, it is obvious that Japan occupies a major position in East Asian commerce. Looking at the commercial trends in the past six months, there are two concentration points in northern and southern Asia. The north is the Japanese ports and Zhili Bay, and the south is the Straits Settlements and the South Seas Islands. Japan is busy with the war, has no ability to obtain foreign exchange, and has no ability to broadly collect foreign raw materials to help the flourishing of domestic industry. It does not have time to export light industrial consumer goods to Korea and Taiwan, and it cannot take advantage of the opportunity to make industrial manufactured products sell well in various parts of China. Currently, Japan only accounts for 30% of China's commercial exchanges with foreign countries in the eighteen provinces, and 40% in the occupied areas. Although Japan has exclusively occupied 70% of the import and export trade in northern Chinese ports, this is only because other countries' trade with China is frequently obstructed, not because more Japanese goods are imported than in the past.</p>
<p>If the import and export items are calculated separately, the import of foreign goods into China is only reduced by 10% compared with the two years before the outbreak of the war, and the difference is not very large. For example, the newly imported cotton in Shanghai accounts for one-fifth of the national demand, which is a major commodity in the import category. On the contrary, the export of Chinese goods overseas has been greatly reduced due to the obstruction or disturbance of the main transportation lines. It is said that it has been reduced by 50% compared with before the war.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the other hand, Japan is seeking to obtain raw materials in the occupied areas so that it can export them to Japan in large quantities. Although this move has been carried out with efforts by the Japanese side, it has ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Contemporary geographers argue that the purpose of Japan's war against China is to obtain Chinese raw materials to assist the military industry of the three islands and then expand outward. Unexpectedly, as proven by facts, the result is the opposite. As for the decline in the price of Chinese currency in the second half of July this year, it has actually caused great difficulties for foreign imports into China. The amount of foreign goods imported in August this year has obviously decreased sharply. The amount of imports at the port of Hong Kong decreased by 12% compared with the first half of 1938, while the amount of exports has not decreased. The reason why imports are not as good as before is only because the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou and cut off Hong Kong's rear route. Before Japan occupied Shantou, Hong Kong was able to change its rear route to Shantou. Now, Hong Kong can become a partner in southern Asian commerce with two other ports: French Guangzhou Bay and Portuguese Macau. Both of the above ports have a vast rear route that can be used for commercial import and export connections and responses.</p>
<p>In addition, French Vietnam, in the six months of the first half of this year, has seen a great improvement in the market due to the large number of Chinese goods passing through. Its local export business is also growing secretly. The British Straits Settlements have seen a sudden boom in exports due to the good price of rubber. The profit from rubber exports in the Dutch East Indies was previously insufficient to offset the losses from the decline in exports of tin, oil, and palm oil, but these export goods have been active since July.</p>
<h3>Shantou Falls into a Desolate and Tragic State; Merchants and Civilians' Goods Forcibly Purchased; Bandits Run Rampant, Robbing with Axes; Japanese Troops in Chao'an Still Under Siege</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese army proclaims that the economic value of Chao'an and Shantou surpasses their strategic importance. Indeed, before Shantou fell on June 21st, the Chao'an and Shantou region was the only international trading port within China. Goods flowed in and out, and vehicles and laborers transporting goods traveled day and night on the Min-Yue-Gan Highway in an endless stream. But how long did it take for it to transform into desolate ruins after being occupied by the Japanese army?</p>
<p>Shantou City was the only trading port for foreign trade in South China. The Japanese army used bayonets to force merchants who had not fled to reopen their shops. Those who refused were occupied by Taiwanese people who operated the shops in their stead. Therefore, shops on Zhi Ping Road, An Ping Road, Zhen Ping Road, and Sheng Ping Road reluctantly opened their doors. The Chen Sheng Company, which specializes in selling electrical machinery and hardware, had Japanese people come to purchase machine parts worth several thousand yuan, but in the end, they paid nothing, only saying they were borrowing them temporarily. Furthermore, goods displayed for sale by Zhen Yuan Company, Guang Fa Company, and others, worth twenty yuan, were bought by the Japanese for one or two yuan in military scrip. In less than three to five days, nine-tenths of the companies' inventory was forcibly sold. After the goods were sold, it was impossible to replenish them, as Shantou could no longer trade with other ports. Only one British ship goes to Hong Kong via Shantou each week. Sometimes, the Japanese ship "Guangdong Maru" arrives in Shantou from Keelung, carrying military supplies and not ordinary goods. There is an extreme shortage of goods from various places. The shops forced to open are therefore desolate. From September, they automatically closed their doors. The foreign firms opened by Japanese and Taiwanese people have shop assistants sitting idle all day long, with not a single customer entering. Once dusk falls, it is like a dead market, with no pedestrians on the road. Bandits often break down doors with axes to rob. Even the doors of the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and other foreign firms' warehouses along the waterfront are pried open by robbers. Although the merchants have purchased various types of insurance for the goods stored in foreign warehouses, it is all in vain. The Japanese army found the puppet police useless and organized a puppet protection corps instead. They patrol the roads during the day and hide in various agencies at night. In Shantou, rice costs one yuan for only two catties, soybean oil costs one yuan per catty, and pork costs one yuan for fourteen taels. Other daily necessities are up to twenty times more expensive than before. When the Japanese army first entered Chao'an and Shantou, they engaged in costless business, forcibly selling rice stored in warehouses. They bought ten catties of rice for one yuan in military scrip and five catties for one yuan in silver currency. Now that the rice has been sold out, the value of military scrip has plummeted, with one yuan exchanging for only thirty to fifty cents in silver currency. The personnel of the puppet agencies are secretly hoarding silver currency, preparing to use it as travel expenses in the future. No one is willing to sell goods for military scrip. In the trading market, it's "money first, goods later." The price is agreed upon first, the paper money is handed over, and then the buyer is asked to wait while the shop assistant goes out through the back door to fetch the goods from elsewhere. Unless you understand the local language or have an acquaintance to introduce you, it is not easy to buy even a box of matches. The water and land transportation of the Japanese army in Chao'an and Shantou is often cut off by the Chinese army. From October, the Japanese army has been constantly reinforcing. On the 15th, Chao'an city was surrounded, and the Chinese army charged into the city three times. Three hundred Japanese cavalry and artillerymen from Anbu, led by Hori and Kawada, set out in two routes, attempting to harass the rear of the Chinese army. One attacked Xiamizhou on the north side of the railway, and the other attacked Tuopu at the foot of Sangpu Mountain. More than half of the villagers' houses in the western village of Tuopu were burned, leaving behind more than seventy corpses. On the 16th, they turned to attack Tuodong and Tuobei, and all the villagers scattered and fled, implementing a scorched-earth policy. The Japanese army plundered for three days before retreating to Anbu. The Japanese army advancing north along the railway line dared not advance further after reaching Caitang Market, because fierce battles were taking place in Fuyang, Gezhou, Yunbu Market. and there were ambushes by Chinese guerrillas along the way. On the 19th and 20th, five Japanese warships arrived in Shantou, carrying seven or eight hundred Japanese soldiers. The headquarters was moved to Taihe Market in Anbu, overseeing Chenghai City and reinforcing the defenses of Caitang, Guanchao, and Fuyang. A large number of Chinese traitors were sent to various villages to urge the establishment of puppet organizations, luring disgruntled military personnel, local tyrants, and evil gentry to become their pawns, and expanding the strength of the village self-defense corps and puppet army. Sixty to seventy civilian boats were requisitioned near Wubridge in Shantou, with the intention of attacking Jieyang. A few days ago, motorboats were sent to harass the villages of Guanbu, Zagang, and Dongfeng, plundering rice, grain, and livestock, but they were all defeated by the local militias. Shantou is so short of supplies that the Japanese army is eager to expand its occupied area, probably to obtain a supply of grain and rice.</p>

<h3>During the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction: Recent Employment Situation of Specialized Talents; The Consultation Office Introduces Employment for 300 People</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The Specialized and Technical Work Consultation Office of the Central Committee for Cooperation between Construction and Education is the only agency under the Central Government that introduces employment. The handling of registration and job placement of specialized and technical personnel has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that as of the end of September, a total of more than 1,100 people have applied for registration, most of whom are talents in engineering, agriculture, science, and business, with fewer in the fields of literature and law. Since the office moved to rural areas, registrations through correspondence from other places have been extremely enthusiastic, reaching more than 400 people. In order to facilitate registration, the office strives to simplify procedures, requiring only the completion of a registration application form, along with the submission of various certificates and two photos. The certificates are returned immediately after verification. Once registered, the office makes every effort to introduce job opportunities to each registrant. Recently, the office introduced suitable personnel to various Central Government agencies for the selection of specialized talents, to a certain highway bureau in Guiyang for the recruitment of mechanical personnel, to middle schools in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hubei provinces for the employment of teachers of various subjects, and to a certain military agency, surveying agency, and company for the recruitment of civil engineering, surveying, and accounting personnel. In total, the office has introduced job opportunities in more than 200 cases, with more than 900 people being introduced, and more than 300 people already employed. More than 100 people are still in the process of negotiations. The office has now moved to Bishan ××guan to work, and the official car travels between Chongqing and Beibei, which is very convenient. It is heard that a certain university is entrusting the office to recruit professors of electrical engineering and mechanical engineering, a certain vocational school in Guizhou is entrusting the office to recruit teachers of Chinese language and civics, a certain vocational school in Hubei is entrusting the office to recruit teachers of printing and chemical engineering, and a certain industrial company is entrusting the office to recruit statistical accounting talents, and more. The office is currently looking for and introducing them. At this time when we are concentrating our efforts on the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, the work of the office will become more urgently needed. Anyone who wishes to hire or request an introduction to employment can go to the office to register and negotiate. The detailed methods of registration and introduction, as well as the registration application form, will be sent immediately upon request by mail.</p>
<h3>Refugee Relief Association Establishes More Than 60 Free Schools with 2,500 Students</h3>
<p>Mr. Li from the Education Department of the Refugee Relief Association in this city said that the association attaches great importance to refugee education and compulsory education. Regarding refugee education, schools have been established in the first and second refugee camps. Regarding compulsory education, the association began to run both adult and children's free schools last year, with more than 60 children's free schools and only 6 adult free schools due to the smaller number of people. This year, the number of children's free schools has suddenly increased to 80 classes. The school sites are mostly borrowed from the local school authorities free of charge. Books and stationery are provided free of charge by the Education Department. Teachers are strictly selected and appointed by the department, so teaching is taken quite seriously. It is estimated that there will be more than 2,500 students in total. At the same time, there were many absentees in the previous session, probably due to the free nature of the schools, so the students did not take it seriously. Therefore, this session has learned from this experience and charges each student a deposit of five corners, stipulating that it will be refunded at the end of the term if the student does not miss more than one-quarter of the classes. Those who drop out or discontinue their studies halfway through will not be refunded. Therefore, only 5% of the students are absent this session, and most of them are in border areas such as Caojiadu and Xujiahui, and most of them are absent due to illness. This month, the department will send staff to inspect all the free schools under its jurisdiction in the city. However, there are still only six adult free schools this session. Most of the poor people and women in the society are mostly engaged in occupations or working as laborers. However, more books were distributed this session, and the prices have also risen, so it is really difficult to decide according to the budget. However, we can only distribute according to the budget. Therefore, if the results of this session are good, we will increase the number of schools next session. The salaries of the teachers can be decided according to the budget. Unexpectedly, the cost of living has increased, so they must ask for appropriate subsidies. However, due to the limitation of the budget, there are no additional funds to supplement, so we will give appropriate subsidies next session.</p>
<p>A Review and Prospect of the Mass Education Center (1) - Chen Lijiang</p>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) Mr. Chen Lijiang, Director of the Department of Social Affairs of the Ministry of Education, recently wrote an article "A Review and Prospect of the Mass Education Center", in which he described in detail the past situation and future plans of the Ministry of Education's sponsored undertaking. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Retrospect of the past</p>
<p>Past Achievements: The Mass Education Center is a new educational undertaking in the modern educational history of our country. Although its history is extremely short, it has only been a little more than ten years since the term "Mass Education Center" was discovered. However, its achievements cannot be regarded as relatively outstanding in the entire history of education. Looking back to before 1927, there were no mass education centers in society at that time. Although the so-called popular education centers and popular education associations were also set up for the masses, their ideals and implementation methods were different from those of mass education centers. Since 1927, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and the military campaign came to an end. Those who were interested silently observed the organization and training of the masses, and education was needed everywhere. Only then did they begin to advocate mass education slightly. The Mass Education Center is a comprehensive institution for implementing mass education, and it is also the central institution for implementing mass education. The establishment of them in various provinces and cities is even more common. According to the survey and statistics of the Ministry of Education, there were 180 in the 17th year, 386 in the 18th year, 645 in the 19th year, 900 in the 20th year, 1,003 in the 21st year, 1,149 in the 22nd year, 1,249 in the 23rd year, 1,397 in the 24th year, and 1,612 in the 25th year. In nine years, the number has increased almost nine times, which shows the rapid development. Because the Mass Education Center is a new system, the central government and various provinces and cities have promulgated many laws and regulations in the past ten years. People from all over the world who study and engage in mass education have also successively published many opinions. These laws and regulations and partisan views can be said to be the driving force for promoting the system of the Mass Education Center and making it more strict and stable. In terms of government laws and regulations, the Ministry of Education promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Mass Education Centers in February 1932, the Regulations on Mass Education Centers in April 1939, and the Outline of Work for Mass Education Centers and the Outline of Methods for Mass Education Centers to Guide Social Education in Various Places in May of the same year. Jiangsu Province promulgated the Provisional Regulations on the Organization of County-Level Mass Education Centers in the 17th year of the Republic of China, and the Important Points for Social Education Facilities in Various Counties in the 19th year, the Preliminary Methods for Sorting Out and Expanding Social Education Institutions in Various Counties, the Standards for Social Education Facilities in Various Counties in the 21st year, the Outline of Methods for Promoting Mass Education by District in Various Counties, and the Minimum Standards of Work for County-Level Social Education Institutions, In the 22nd year, the Measures for Popularizing Mass Education by Central Institutions in Mass Education Districts in Various Counties, the Standard Work of Central Institutions in Mass Education Districts in Various Counties, and the Measures for Provincial Social Education Micro-agencies to Guide Social Education in Various Counties were promulgated. In the 23rd year, the Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Provincial Mass Education Centers and the Provincial Mass Education Centers and Education Colleges' Inspection and Guidance Measures for Social Education Institutions in Various Counties were promulgated.</p>

<h3>Olympic World Games to Be Held in the United States; Finland Ready but Unwilling to Give Up; Barrela Makes Statement in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Beijing, 29th, Havas) The President of the International Olympic World Games Committee, Barrela, recently stated to the press that "Finland still hopes that the next Olympic World Games can be held in its capital as scheduled next year. No matter how the situation changes, it will never give up lightly before May 1st next year, because various preparations, except for the swimming pool, have been largely completed. Regarding this matter, the International Committee has sent a letter to the participating countries, raising two questions: (1) If the European war lasts for a long time, can the Olympic Games still be held as scheduled next year? (2) If it is held in Finland, will the countries still be able to send athletes to participate? It is not yet known what the opinions of the countries are, but the international sports organizations believe that the Olympic Games can still be held technically next year, so Finland should continue to prepare as usual. At the same time, the United States government has made a suggestion to the International Committee, arguing that if Finland abandons it due to the situation, it may as well be held in Detroit, USA. If so, even if the warring countries cannot participate, at least the United States, Japan, the Scandinavian Peninsula countries, and other neutral countries can still send athletes to participate in the competition."</p>
<p>(New York, 29th, Havas) The President of the International Olympic Committee, Barrela, made a statement in the capital of Belgium yesterday, saying that if the 1940 Olympic Games cannot be held in Finland as originally planned, they may be held in Detroit, USA. The President of the American Olympic Committee, Byron Taj, recently said that the American Committee has not received any notice of how the International Committee will decide and knows nothing about it.</p>
<h3>Special Charity Football Match to Be Held Next Month; Scheduled for November 13th; Allied British and French Troops to Fight Chinese Alliance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Westerners' Football Club announced yesterday that this season's special charity football match will be held earlier on the 13th of next month (Monday), as the Premier's birthday happens to fall on a Sunday, and all agencies, groups, and major commercial firms will take a compensatory holiday on Monday. It is understood that this match is being held at the request of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, and the opposing teams are planning to form an Allied British and French Army to fight against the Chinese Alliance. The organization of the Chinese Alliance team, in addition to gathering the elite of Shanghai, will use Lido as the basic team. The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee has also sent personnel to Hong Kong on a special trip last Thursday, intending to invite the "Football King" Li Huitang to come north to call for support, but it is difficult to be sure that he will come to Shanghai. In addition, the announcement yesterday stated that the colors of the jerseys of the three existing teams have been changed, including the blue and black jerseys of the Jewish Association, with white shorts and black socks, the purple and white striped jerseys of the Qiutingsi, with white shorts and black socks, and the blue and white striped jerseys of the McKaybies, with blue shorts and black socks.</p>
<h3>Second Middle School Cup Table Tennis Competition to Open on the 11th of Next Month; More Than 20 Schools Have Registered</h3>
<p>The Second Shanghai Middle School Cup Table Tennis Championship, organized by Zhonghua Middle School, has received registrations from more than 20 schools, including Minli, Huatong, Fudan Shizhong, Daxia Affiliated Middle School, Provincial Yangzhong, Provincial Songzhong, Dagong, Guangxia, Zhaoguang, Binhai, Xizhong, Zhonghua No. 1 School, Zhonghua No. 2 School, Private Shangzhong, Minsheng, Daguan, Shanghai Affiliated Middle School, Nanyang, and Zhongfa. Among them, a few schools such as Private Shangzhong and Zhongfa have not completed the procedures. We hope that they will go to Ding Du of the Physical Education Department of the school at No. 7 Pu Road within a week to complete the procedures, otherwise their qualifications will be cancelled. The competition is scheduled to open at 7:00 pm on the 11th of next month (Saturday).

<h3>金融 外匯鬆勢日甚一日 華商多頭十去其六 美滙逼近九元關口</h3>
<p>The trend of foreign exchange easing is increasing day by day.  The majority of Chinese merchants who held long positions, six out of ten, have exited.  The US dollar is approaching the nine-yuan mark.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions at the HSBC exchange announcement:  Due to the continuous decline of the British pound, the price of British gold rose by 15, calculated at 4 shillings and a halfpenny.  The US dollar was listed at 3125, equivalent to 7 yuan 4375.  Apart from German exchange, which had no market, other currencies were uniformly lengthened.  In the black market for British and American exchange, the intensity of the loosening trend increased day by day.  The price of British gold had already exceeded the previous high of 5 shillings and 25 pence, once even reaching 5 shillings and 375 pence.  The US dollar nearly reached a new level of nine yuan.  This was truly due to the on-again, off-again peace talks that created an uproar.  Opinions varied, and it was not worth the attention of knowledgeable people.  However, the gradual expansion of the European war, coupled with rumors that the London Treasury Department would implement strict exchange controls starting from the 15th of next month, and the successful domestic war situation, greatly consolidated the financial market. These were the important factors driving the recent easing trend.  Throughout the day, the overseas exchange rate for the US against the UK initially narrowed by half, causing the US dollar to be tighter than the British pound, with the British pound at 0.015625 and the US dollar at 0.0625.  Subsequently, the yarn and flower traders and the Hong Kong Electric Company aggressively loosened, reaching 5 shillings and 375 pence for British gold and 8 yuan 9375 for the US dollar. (It was reported that over 60% of Chinese merchants with long positions had already exited).  Afterwards, Sassoon HSBC and others purchased, immediately softening the rate to 5 shillings and 1875 pence and 8 yuan 625.  However, with the re-emergence of Hong Kong Electric and speculators, despite some buying by foreign firms, the market remained hard until the afternoon closing, reaching 5 shillings and 28125 pence for British gold and 8 yuan 78125 for the US dollar.  The afternoon situation was calmer.  Initially, HSBC and McCallie bought, briefly softening the rate, but due to dumping by Hong Kong Electric and American banks, the market trended hard again.  Until the evening closing, the state remained unchanged, with British gold at 5 shillings and 25 pence and the US dollar at 8 yuan 75, compared to the previous day, the British pound rose by 140625 and the US dollar hardened by 11875.  There was some activity in futures trading, but it was slightly closed in, similar to the spot market situation.  Trading volume was robust throughout the day.</p>
<p>HSBC's Listed Exchange Rates Increase Further</p>
<p>In the early morning, there was no cable from London regarding the prime rate or US bank rates. The London gold price remained unchanged. Exchange rates for the British pound against the US dollar and the French franc were stable, while the exchange rate against Shanghai increased by 1875. The US dollar fell by half against the British pound, rose by two dimes against Shanghai, and rose slightly by twenty-five against the French franc. Central bank listed rates for all currencies remained the same. At the morning opening, banks quoted a spot selling rate of 5 shillings and 09375 pence for British gold and 8 yuan 46875 for the US dollar, tighter by 0.015625 and softer by 0.0625, respectively, compared to the previous weekend. The US dollar was softer than the British pound due to the continuing contraction of exchange rates. After the opening, due to cables from Hong Kong and selling pressure from Chinese merchants and yarn and flower traders, coupled with the intention of American banks, such as Chase Bank, to profit, the market trended significantly softer. British gold rose from 5 shillings and 125 pence to 325 pence, and the US dollar hardened from 8 yuan and a half to 875. The HSBC listing revealed an increase of 25 for British gold and 3125 for the US dollar. The silver balance tax remained unchanged. After 10:30 AM, British gold once reached 5 shillings and 375 pence, and the US dollar also reached 8 yuan and 9375. Subsequently, HSBC bought aggressively, and Sassoon and Everbright also followed suit, causing the situation to suddenly reverse. British gold immediately tightened to 5 shillings and 1875 pence, and the US dollar also softened back to 8 yuan 625. After 11 AM, buying interest waned. Although import foreign firms made some purchases, Hong Kong Electric and speculators re-emerged, causing British gold to rise again to 5 shillings and 3125 pence, and the US dollar to harden again to 8 yuan 8125. The situation was calmer at noon. At the afternoon closing, the bank spot selling rate was 5 shillings and 28125 pence for British gold and 8 yuan 78125 for the US dollar, easing by 1875 and hardening by 3125 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>The Distance Between Spot and Futures Slightly Narrows Again</p>
<p>The afternoon market situation was calm. Initially, HSBC and McCallie made good purchases, slightly softening the market. British gold tightened from 5 shillings and 25 pence to 21875 pence, and the US dollar softened from 8 yuan 75 to 225. Afterwards, Hong Kong Electric continued to dump, and American banks, such as Chase Bank, showed strong selling intentions, so at the evening closing, the bank spot selling rate for British gold hardened again to 5 shillings and 25 pence, and the US dollar softened again to 8 yuan 75. The current month's price was the same as the previous price. British gold for November was 5 shillings and 21875 pence, and the US dollar was 8 yuan 6875. As a result, compared to last Saturday, spot and current-month British gold both eased by 140625, and US dollars hardened by 21875. British gold for November increased by 15625, and the US dollar depreciated by 25.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Advances to 5 Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 30th, telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The British and Japanese exchange rates were unchanged. The US dollar spot rate contracted by 0625 to 24 yuan 9375. The Shanghai exchange rate spot rate fell by 8 yuan to 284 yuan. Forward rates were not quoted. At 10:00 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate spot rate continued to fall by 2 yuan to 282 yuan. At 10:25 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate spot rate continued to fall by 3 yuan to 279 yuan. The opening prices at 11:30 AM and 2:30 PM were both flat. At the closing, the Shanghai exchange rate spot rate recovered by 1 yuan to 280 yuan, a total decrease of 14 yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Exchange Rates Contract</p>
<p>Tianjin, 30th, telegram: The exchange market opened strong this morning. British and American exchange rates both contracted by 0625. The British exchange rate was 4 shillings 875 pence, and the US dollar exchange rate was 8 yuan 125. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by half a yuan to 104 yuan. The black market for "Joint Notes" also depreciated by half a yuan to 93 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>外幣下降亦速</h3>
<p>The decline in foreign currencies is also rapid.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange easing trend was drastic, and the sharp decline was fierce. The supply of British and American gold pounds suddenly increased, continuing to decline. The sale of British and American gold tickets was very strong, customer demand was sharply reduced, and the market price fell sharply. Demand for Hong Kong and French franc tickets was also scarce, and the market price was weak. Singapore, Dutch, and Annam tickets also presented a depressed state. The supply and demand of Canadian tickets was relatively scarce, and the decline was also slight. Philippine, Australian gold, and Siamese tickets remained stable. However, the rupee finally showed weakness. The supply of Japanese gold tickets was relatively abundant, with prices fluctuating and slightly soft, with the evening market at 1 yuan, 3 cents, 1 point, and 2 mils. Demand for Korean tickets increased, with the evening market at 1 yuan and 9 points. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell by 1 yuan and 5 dimes, British gold tickets fell by 1 yuan, US gold pounds fell by 2 yuan, US gold tickets fell by 3 dimes and 3 cents, Hong Kong and Singapore tickets both fell by 5 cents, French franc tickets fell by 5 mils, Dutch tickets fell by 2 dimes, Annam tickets fell by 1 dime and 5 cents, Canadian tickets fell by 1 dime, and others remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>與匯兌亦步亦趨 金市每況愈下</h3>
<p>Following the Exchange Rate Closely, the Gold Market Worsens</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market conditions felt increasingly depressed. The situation was difficult to escape the hovering state. Although demand from the Hong Kong traders was still active, the amount of purchases was not large, so it failed to boost market sentiment. The general retail investors, in view of the gradual lengthening of foreign exchange and the continuous selling from the Tianjin traders, rarely bought. Most floating long positions also gave up price recovery, mostly selling with a small profit principle. The entire process shifted with the soft easing of foreign exchange. In the early morning, due to the large increase in foreign exchange, both official and unofficial, and the aggressive pressing by securities traders and a certain gold firm, prices plummeted, opening near 100 yuan to 3,630 yuan. Then, as foreign exchange tightened, it stirred up market sentiment. The gold firm immediately stopped selling and bought in, and a certain securities trader also entered the market to search for purchases. In addition, a money exchange business took the opportunity to aggressively raise prices, so it rose to the daily peak of 3,700 yuan. In the afternoon, foreign exchange eased again, and scattered retail investors tried to close positions, causing the closing price to be only 3,656 yuan, a drastic drop of 69 yuan compared to last weekend. Trading volume was robust throughout the day at over 1,300 taels. Gold jewelry was priced at a premium of 5 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained level.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Fell 69 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened in a scattered and weak manner. Hearing that foreign exchange was lengthening, sentiment became even more uncertain, and there was a chorus of selling. A certain gold firm and securities traders pressed prices aggressively, and the opening price plummeted 95 yuan compared to last weekend. A securities trader sold 30 taels to a jewelry trader at a price of 3,630 yuan. Shortly after, although foreign exchange was still soft, some bought because they thought the price was cheap. At the same time, customers also entrusted a certain money exchange to buy in, raising prices by 50 yuan in an instant. A money exchange business bought 50 taels from a jewelry trader for 3,680 yuan. Thereafter, a securities trader and a certain gold firm resumed aggressively selling, and jewelry traders were also actively hedging. Then, it fell by another 55 yuan. The securities trader, gold firm, and jewelry trader sold a total of 70 taels to a certain money exchange business, all at a price of 3,625 yuan. Subsequently, foreign exchange suddenly tightened, boosting market sentiment. A certain gold firm urgently shifted its target and started buying, and a certain securities trader also followed suit. A certain money exchange business took the opportunity to raise prices, causing it to rebound by 75 yuan. A jewelry trader bought 20 taels from a money exchange business for 3,700 yuan. After 11 AM, foreign exchange suddenly trended softer again, and buyers gradually decreased. A certain gold firm suddenly resumed selling, and securities traders and money exchange businesses also sold to each other, causing it to fall by 55 yuan. A securities trader sold 30 taels to a jewelry trader for 3,645 yuan. At noon, a money exchange business slightly absorbed, raising prices by 15 yuan. The money exchange business bought 20 taels from a gold firm for 3,660 yuan, making it the afternoon closing price. The initial opening in the afternoon was quite flat. Initially, a securities trader sold 30 taels to a money exchange business, still at 3,660 yuan. Then, money exchange businesses sold, pressing prices down by 10 yuan. A money exchange business sold 20 taels to a gold firm for 3,650 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange softened, and a certain gold firm absorbed and pulled prices up by 30 yuan. The gold firm bought 20 taels from a securities trader for 3,680 yuan. Later, foreign exchange hardened slightly again, and money exchange businesses and securities traders sold successively, causing prices to decline and fall by 24 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded with each other for 10 taels, making the evening closing price 3,656 yuan. As a result, it fell by 69 yuan compared to last weekend. It was heard that after the closing, securities firms sold 20 taels to a certain bank for 3,654 yuan. The entire dog fluctuated by 75 yuan. The selling price of spot gold from cash firms was 10 yuan higher compared to spot gold, and the purchase price had to be reduced by more than 20 yuan. Spot margin was about 50 yuan lower than listed gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Priced at a Premium of 5 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial exchange price for gold jewelry per tael was still 375 yuan at the major stores. At 9:45 AM, it was priced at a premium of 5 yuan. There were no changes afterwards. As a result, major stores changed the listed price to 370 yuan. The new stores had the same price, and the purchase price had to be lowered by 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>證劵 統丙一度 達五十元 祥泰木行派息</h3>
<p>Securities:  "Tong Bing" Once Reached Fifty Yuan;  Sime Darby Declares Dividend</p>
<p>In the black market for securities, the trend was gradually improving yesterday.  "Bing Xu" once reached fifty yuan, which was the highest price since the 13th of the hole month.  However, the upward movement failed to hold due to profittaking by many investors.  Still, the market showed the best trend in the morning.  Buyers, such as Da Feng, Jiu Fu, and Run Li, were quite enthusiastic, although sellers were also not weak, with De Fu continuously unloading positions.  Prices gradually rose, improving by six or seven corners before noon.  The momentum continued into the afternoon, with numbers 11 and 20 still in high demand.  "Bing Xu" even reached the fifty-yuan mark.  Unfortunately, De Fu still had a large number of positions to unload, and Lian Yi and Yong Da also liquidated long positions, so the market remained under pressure and failed to stabilize.  The future outlook remained one of mixed and volatile movements.  Ultimately, "Tong" increased by three to five corners, with a total transaction volume of approximately 1.2 million yuan.  A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Transaction:  A total of 50 shares of the Yarn Exchange were transacted at a price of 40 yuan and 5 corners, slightly higher than before.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the Chamber of Commerce was quite lively.  The shares of the Yip Guang Land Company soared, surpassing all others, likely due to the proliferation of rumors regarding the northern district.  The opening bid was 9 yuan and 2 corners, quickly jumping to 10 yuan and 5 corners.  This price triggered some profit-taking, and the market slightly retreated to 10 yuan and 2 corners for buying and 3 corners for selling at the close.  The unique activity of this stock overshadowed others, which lacked notable records but remained stable in price, similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Sime Darby Timber Company Limited, a British firm, resolved at yesterday's board meeting to distribute an interim dividend based on the shareholder register as of the 30th of this month, at a rate of 1 yuan and 25 cents per share in national currency.</p>
<h3>紗花 紗市變成兩處集會 內銷清淡市價慘跌</h3>
<p>Yarn and Flowers: Yarn Market Becomes Two Meeting Places, Weak Domestic Sales and Plummeting Prices</p>
<p>The yarn market has declined, and the decline is particularly severe. This is because the actual demand is too sluggish. According to sources from a certain cotton industry organization, the consumption of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Kunming, Chongqing, and other inland areas is already clear, but the market price is depressed. Therefore, the customer traders still have no purchasing power, and transactions are lonely. In addition, the meeting place has moved to the second floor of the eastern section of the New World, but some customer traders have not participated, gathering instead in the exchange. The reason given is the lack of telephones at the new address, causing a disconnect in information and slow responses. Thus, it has become two meeting places, resulting in inconsistent market prices. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn is quoted at 640 yuan at the New World and 646 yuan at the exchange, a difference of 6 yuan. It is conceivable that this is chaotic and disorganized. However, because the new relocation has not yet been unified, it should return to normal in the future.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in a scattered and weak atmosphere. The opening price of 20-count Fairy Maiden yarn was 633 yuan, and the Double Horse price was 640 yuan, both for spot goods. Then, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was continuing to ease, and there was a lack of buyers, causing the market price to fall again. Double Horse yarn fell to 628 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, only 345 bales were traded. The prices of 20-count Double Horse fell by 22 yuan and a half, and Fairy Maiden yarn fell by 12 yuan. 25 pieces of yarn were exported to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each trader is listed below:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders: 290; Hong Kong: 10; Fujian: 5;</p>
<p>Wenzhou: 30; Xiamen: 10; Total: 345</p>
<h3>交易停頓 棉價日落</h3>
<p>Trading Stagnant, Cotton Prices Fall Daily</p>
<p>Cotton trading has virtually come to a halt. Domestic and foreign factories show little interest, largely due to the persistent weakness of cotton yarn prices. Faced with this environment, factories are increasingly reluctant to replenish raw materials. Moreover, the continuing depreciation of foreign exchange adds to the overall uncertainty. At the same time, supplies from northern Jiangsu have diminished sharply, with only 118 bales arriving from Tongzhou, 778 from Changyinsha, and 640 from Beisha. Only a few firms involved in the trade made deals for 700 bales of Tongzhou cotton at prices ranging from 128.5 to 129.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Another Report: Due to the recent easing of exchange rates and the drastic drop in yarn prices, factories and traders believe that the corresponding decline in cotton prices has been too large, making it impossible to release their existing inventory. Therefore, they are unwilling to sell at lower prices. Trading in Qingdao cotton is also extremely quiet. The cotton trade has entered a difficult phase, and a turnaround is unlikely in the short term.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market has been relatively firm recently. The market was particularly active in the early morning. Cloth sales have been brisk, leading to robust demand from factories. News from Bombay was bullish, boosting market sentiment. Overseas cotton merchants were also actively purchasing in the market, resulting in closing prices that were higher than the previous day by 4 to 8 points. The Egyptian cotton market was quite mixed, with fluctuations up and down. Forecasts indicate a rise of 4 rupees.</p>
<h3>疋頭 氣候驟冷 絨布旺銷 —海白龍飛漲—</h3>
<p>Piece Goods: Sudden Cold Weather Boosts Flannel Sales - "Shanghai White Dragon" Skyrockets</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market weakened due to the lengthening of foreign exchange and anxiety. However, sales of coarse cloth and flannel were active, and the impact was evident. The range of price fluctuations was also narrow. Since the end of the month was approaching, all of the hoarded coarse cloth that was urgently for sale had already been sold. The remaining hoarders remained unmoved. Therefore, the price of coarse cloth per piece has risen by one or two dimes, gradually approaching the factory price. Traders from this street and various parts of eastern Zhejiang Province (Wenzhou, Ningbo, Taizhou) handled over 400 bales of coarse cloth, and 30 to 40 bales of fine cloth and fine twill. Traders from Fujian Province handled over 50 pieces of colored twill and colored cloth. Traders from Guangdong Province handled over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, flannel, colored cloth, and colored twill. The retail business on this street has been booming in various flannels due to the sudden rise of northwesterly winds and sudden cold weather. Purchasing interest is strong. 9.5 lb velveteen is quoted at 16.5 to 17 yuan, and double-sided velveteen is quoted at 17.5 yuan, and prices are stable.</p>
<p>The white goods in Dong Cloth are weak due to the drop in yarn prices. Because it is the end of the month, many traders are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the market for fine cloth and fine twill is very sluggish, and the selling price is moving down again, decreasing by one dime per piece. 12 lb Dragon Head fine cloth is quoted at 18.65 yuan for spot goods, and fine twill is quoted at 17.4 yuan. There were no changes in the morning or afternoon. Drill fluctuates between 6 dimes, 1 cent, 15 mils to 5 mils. Traders from Tianjin purchased one hundred and several tens of pieces of white goods and fine cloth. 3 to 4 hundred pieces were sold on this street.</p>
<p>18 pieces of cloth were exported today to Hong Kong and 12 pieces to Haiphong. Yesterday, 209 pieces of silk were shipped from Ningbo.</p>
<p>"Shanghai White Dragon", also known as "Kai Mo Taikesi" or "Qi Hu Chang Mao Rong" (likely names for a type of wool or fur fabric), is sold at 36.5 yuan per yard in large department stores, and 34.5 to 35 yuan in the woolen cloth trade. A woman's colored coat costs over 100 yuan, and many are still being made.</p>
<h3>糧食 粳米尚平 客秈壟斷堅俏</h3>
<p>Grains: Japonica Rice Remains Stable, Indica Rice Monopolized and Tight</p>
<p>After the price of the premium indica rice market rose all the way recently, yesterday the rising trend continued. The supply has been cut off, and the market inventory is becoming increasingly scarce. Certain parties are monopolizing the market, causing a sudden shortage of chips in the market. The supply and demand in the market are mostly in the hands of customer traders and hoarders, while the number held by the brokerage houses is very small. Therefore, the local shops must rely on the customer traders and hoarders to supply goods. These people have always aimed to profit. When a purchase is made, they raise the price. At closing, special Wuhu premium indica was priced at 22.5 yuan, and premium Dayuan indica was priced at 19.5 yuan. Old Dayuan indica was also priced at 19.5 yuan. Compared to the previous market, all prices rose by six or seven dimes. The supply of premium Luyang indica was not large, and the movement was still good. It also followed the price of the premium indica rice, rising by three to five dimes. The special Yang Premium Indica for the North and South was priced at 24.5 yuan, and the special Reed Premium Indica was priced at 25.3 yuan. Aside from this, the new Japonica broken rice and Bianyuan rice, due to the increasing prominence of the new crop, and the continuous arrival of goods from various regions, most customers were less inclined to make large purchases, and the market was difficult to invigorate. Although the early market had briefly tightened, it then returned to flat. Therefore, the closing market was similar to the previous market. Ordinary premium Japonica rice was still priced at 31.5 to 31 yuan. The trading volume of new thin rice varieties, such as the Luzhong, Mizhong, and Baige, was lacking in large quantities, and sporadic transactions were also weak. Furthermore, goods had been arriving continuously in the past two days, and the market inventory was increasing, so the market was difficult to sustain. Prices continued to depreciate by two or three dimes. At closing, Qing Yong Luzhong was priced at 30.05 yuan, Kiln rice at 30 yuan, Wild rice at 31 yuan, High-quality Fengjia Baige at 29 yuan, and Small amount at 28 yuan. Looking back at the overall market situation, the early market was still a flurry of activity when compared to premium indica. However, close to the end of the market, there were rumors that Wuhu and other places would lift the bans, and the source of supply would be unclogged, and the momentum eased. It is estimated that the number of various goods arriving throughout the city, including Japonica premium rice parcels, totaled three thousand three or four hundred parcels. The number of transactions was only seven or eight thousand parcels because the market tightened and then weakened.</p>
<h3>麥價昂貴 麵粉廠盤又提</h3>
<p>Wheat Prices Expensive, Flour Mill Prices Raised Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour mill prices rose again. The price from the No. 2 flour mill was already 7 yuan and 4 dimes, an increase of 2 dimes from the previous weekend. The sales market for this product can be described as active. Retail sales on this street did not decrease despite the increase in mill prices. The demand from North and South buyers was also continuous. However, because the raw material prices were rising daily, the mills continued to stand firm on their sales prices. Unless customers made contact, the mills would not supply goods, and therefore the number of transactions was relatively quiet. The number of transactions for the entire city was estimated to be over 30,000 bags. There were rumors of prices of 7 yuan and 5 dimes and a half and 6 dimes in the black market, but this may not be the official market situation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market showed some improvement, as wheat from various places is currently under control, and the source of supply is becoming increasingly scarce. Those holding goods are becoming increasingly firm in their grip. Fortunately, the existing inventory is still sufficient, and it was not possible to raise prices temporarily. According to discussions among people in the industry, the highest price is expected to be 12 yuan. Yesterday, the Fuzao and Liang factories jointly handled over 6,000 bags of wheat from Jiangbei, Pudong, Changshu, Wuxi, etc., and hoarders bought in over 10 truckloads, with prices ranging from 9.73 to 11.68 yuan, an increase of two, three, or four dimes compared to before. There was also one truckload of white wheat from this port, which cost 11.8 yuan, due to its particularly high quality.</p>
<h3>絲茶 白廠跌二百元</h3>
<p>Silk and Tea: White Filature Falls 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yokohama spot was 1850 yuan, forward was 1820 yuan. Forward prices increased by 16 yuan. New York was closed. The local silk price was affected by foreign exchange, falling significantly. White filature ORD fell through the 4,000 yuan mark to 3,900 yuan, down over 200 yuan. Seven-eight grade white filature therefore failed to sell. The foreign silk market will likely enter a dim phase. Printed grade white raw silk had some sales yesterday, at 1200 yuan, considered stable. Estimated sales were 15 bundles. 1,000 bales of exported silk were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>糖市 洋糖隨外匯升沉</h3>
<p>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Follows Foreign Exchange Rise and Fall</p>

Domestic No. 1 rock sugar was 64 yuan, Jingming rock sugar was 65.5 yuan, both down slightly 2 yuan. It was rumored that a black market for domestic sugar products from Diaoqing opened with several hundred bags, the goods were ordinary, and the prices were relatively cheap, about 1 or 2 yuan different.</p>

<h3>Two-Sex Hygiene: Preventing Masturbation is for Youth</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science from a Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Preliminary Work for Seeking Health</p>
<p>Innate genetic reasons can, of course, cause a person to impulsively engage in unnatural masturbation, but this is a minority; most masturbation is the result of mutual learning among mischievous or neurologically unsound children, spreading from one to another like wildfire, with even entire classes of students and young people living together becoming infected with this bad habit. In addition, overly tight trousers, rocking horse games, bicycles, etc., can also lead to masturbation due to excessive friction and stimulation of the external genitalia. Therefore, parents and teachers should pay attention to whether the crotches of children's trousers are of the appropriate size and whether there are gaps or openings to prevent them from masturbating at any time. Other factors, such as prolonged sitting, excessive strenuous work, overeating, and excessively warm bedding, can all cause the genitals to become congested and aroused, leading to masturbation. Therefore, children should not be made to go to bed early and get up late. Overly long foreskins, pinworm parasites in the anus, unclean external genitalia, or other skin diseases, constipation, and abnormal urine can all cause itchy sensations, leading to masturbation through friction. In addition, anything that can cause sexual feelings, such as pornographic books, pornographic paintings, and nude images, can excite the sexual nerves of young people and lead to unnatural masturbation. Therefore, during development, all young people must always prevent masturbation to avoid harming their health.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those who commit masturbation are bound to indulge excessively after marriage, resulting in hundreds of diseases of the reproductive function, such as kidney deficiency and infertility, premature aging and impotence, and lower back pain, all of which follow one after another, increasing suffering and making life lose its interest. For the sake of health, young people should not masturbate. In my experience with treatment, nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea can be treated with "Naiersi Anti-Seminal Emission Tablets." For neurasthenia, kidney deficiency and premature ejaculation, and infertility after marriage, the German Bi Wan sperm essence preparation for men, "Buti Kang," is the most effective remedy. Although there are similar preparations on the market that appeal to patients, few are good; most are disguised aphrodisiacs or tonics similar to aphrodisiacs. Only "Buti Kang" is a genuine preparation of testicular essence from robust animals, with the effect of regulating menstruation and producing seeds, and treating anemia and premature aging. Whether male or female students, if their academic performance is declining due to neurasthenia, they can quickly remedy it with "Buti Kang." It can truly restore them to a youthful state from the damage caused by masturbation and the deficiency of essence and blood.</p>
<p>Venereal Disease Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Special Treatment for Complications</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>That gonorrhea can be completely cured is a fact revealed by scientists. However, why does the cry that gonorrhea cannot be cured fill the ears? In fact, these people know nothing about the actual truth of gonorrhea and only echo what others say. As a result, gonorrhea patients are always in a pessimistic atmosphere, allowing the hateful gonococci to spread and grow, leading to hundreds of dangerous symptoms. This is because they have no new understanding of gonorrhea and are limited to old ideas, and even use outdated symptomatic treatments, such as claiming that it can be cured in three to five days. The actual effects of the newly introduced patented medicines are mostly equal to those of the usual useless patented medicines of the past. Originally, cunning gonococci run around like wolves and boars, with no fixed whereabouts, so the symptoms change in many ways. Only experienced and fully equipped physicians can accurately identify and treat them. Therefore, general superficial and localized medicines and surgeries are of no avail. There must be a treatment that surrounds the gonococci and directly puts them to death in order to be effective.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, the German master of gonorrhea, Dr. Peter, first invented the medicine "Kelinong," which is made by mixing proteic ichthyol, based on the principle of non-specific gonorrhea therapy. After testing it on animals such as guinea pigs and gradually improving it, he finally achieved satisfactory results. Whether for new or old gonorrhea, after taking "Kelinong" for only a few hours, its bactericidal effect occurs in the blood, causing various cells to also have an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect. Therefore, the inflammation and swelling caused by gonococci, difficult and unsmooth urination, and the various pains of gonorrhea, such as gonorrhea nodules and the mixing of pus and blood, can be eliminated. It is truly effective in simultaneously curing complications of two or more types of gonococci. This is the unique effect of "Kelinong" and cannot be matched by other inferior medicines. It has been unanimously recognized by major European and American venereal disease hospitals as a special medicine for gonorrhea, so they have successively elaborated on the efficacy of this agent in major venereal disease magazines, which proves the excellence of this agent's efficacy.</p>
<h3>Blood in Sputum</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Patient Wang Yuqing, 33 years old, from Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, (self-report) - I am fond of wine and women. I suffered from a cough in the winter of the year before last, which was not treated at the time. Until last autumn, the cough did not stop, and I felt a stabbing pain in my chest, and there was a lot of thick sputum. Every morning, there were blood spots in the sputum, which caused me great anxiety, and I often had night sweats at night. I beg for treatment, etc. I observed that Mr. Wang had a very high fever and a pale complexion. X-ray examination revealed a walnut-sized cavity in the right lung lobe. I immediately instructed him to rest at home, consume nutritious foods, and actively purchase and take "Bofei Naer." Mr. Wang followed my advice and purchased and took the medicine. As a result, the cough stopped after one month, the appetite increased, the thick sputum decreased after two months, and the night sweats disappeared. After taking it until now, all the symptoms have disappeared, blood in the sputum has no longer been found, and the body is strong and healthy has been restored.</p>
<p>Cured Case of Seminal Emission: German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>A Young Man with Seminal Emission Nearing His Wedding Date and the Efficacy of Rapid Treatment</p>
<p>Patient Xie Shiliang, from Haimen, Zhejiang Province, 25 years old, residing on Caishi Road in the French Concession of this city, (self-report) - At the age of sixteen, I was studying at a certain middle school on Xiafei Road. Due to the temptation of older classmates in the same dormitory, I committed the bad habit of masturbation. At first, I did not realize its harm, so I did it every night to relieve myself. Later, my body became thinner day by day, and I often had symptoms such as dizziness and forgetfulness. I had no interest in schoolwork and found it difficult to take tonics, with no effect. Although I later knew the harm of masturbation and quit, nocturnal emissions occurred. At first, there were two or three times a month, but then gradually increased, even two or three times a week, and there were occasional spermatorrhea phenomena. Now that the wedding date is approaching, I am here for treatment, etc. (Present symptoms) - The seminal vesicle is not firm, the endocrine system is depleted, the sexual organs are short and small, and the brain nerves are weak. (Cure process) - I ordered him to clear his mind and reduce his desires, rub the area with cold water before bed every day, take "Naiersi Anti-Seminal Emission Tablets," and a large amount of male "Buti Kang." Mr. Xie followed my advice and after two weeks, nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea disappeared. After a month, health was restored, and the body became stronger day by day.</p>
<p>Anecdotes on Gonorrhea and Turbidity</p>
<h3>The Secret of Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>— Written by Doctor Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: Ningbo Road</p>
<p>Intersection of Jiujiang Sichuan Road</p>
<p>In today's society, where the old society has not been completely destroyed and the dregs of morality still exist, most people still avoid seeing a doctor for gonorrhea and secretly use inferior medicines on the market or seek treatment from city doctors who offer low-priced package deals and have incomplete equipment, resulting in mostly failure. However, if they can suddenly awaken and change course, using effective treatments can achieve a radical cure. In my daily experience, gonorrhea is not difficult to treat at the beginning, but it eventually becomes difficult to treat mostly because they do not know the great harm this disease will cause in the future at the beginning. Moreover, they transmit gonorrhea to their wives, causing the wives' leucorrhea to increase. Therefore, even if one party is cured, it will recur due to sexual contact, which is equivalent to undoing previous efforts. Besides, it is already difficult to cure one party's gonorrhea. Due to the complexity of the condition and the needs of treatment, it must be treated quickly. If the opportunity for treatment has been lost in the acute gonorrhea period and it turns into chronic gonorrhea and infects the wife, simultaneous treatment must be carried out quickly. This is the secret to radically curing gonorrhea. I hope patients will pay attention to it again and again.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the method of treatment. In my twenty years of experience, I have tried all the popular patented medicines and electrotherapy on the market. Among them, the special medicine for gonorrhea, "Kelinong," is indeed the crown of oral medicines. German static electricity therapy and X-ray electrotherapy are the mainstay of all gonorrhea physical therapy. On the other hand, using German anti-gonorrhea serum can not only eliminate the gonococci that roam in the blood and hide in the joints, but also completely cure stubborn and difficult-to-cure gonorrhea with multiple variations. If a woman has already been infected with gonorrhea, she can simultaneously use "Kaerxuedi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories for better results. Doctor visits are available from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day. Each diagnosis is given a number, and each number only costs five jiao and comes with a free copy of "The Complete Book of Venereal Diseases."</p>

<h3>Negotiations on Cross-Border Road Construction: Priority to Resolve Police Authority Issues; British and American Consulates Have Researched Proposals; Municipal Council Meeting Will Not Propose Discussion</h3>
<p>The specific solutions for cross-border road construction proposed by the Municipal Council's General Manager and Director-General Fei Lipu and the Police Department's Chief Inspector have been drafted and completed, as reported yesterday. According to a certain director of the Municipal Council, judging from the current trend, the solutions proposed by the Municipal Council will soon be submitted to the puppet municipal government and will not be submitted to the Board of Directors meeting on the first of next month for discussion. Because the British and American directors have already conducted thorough consultations outside the meeting and have made a decision, it seems inappropriate to submit them to the Board of Directors meeting for public discussion to avoid causing an immediate dispute between the Chinese and Japanese directors. It is heard that the solutions proposed by the Municipal Council are roughly the same as those discussed by the former Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun and the Municipal Council's Director-General Fei Xindun. The first step is to resolve the police authority issue, and the Municipal Council should give up some of its rights. The issue of donations and taxes will not be discussed for the time being and will be discussed later.</p>
<p>Glimpses of Various Roads in Western Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The tense situation in the cross-border road construction area that was presented last week has gradually dissipated in recent days. When a reporter from Dazhong News Agency inspected the area yesterday, he saw that the defense of the police station in the Caojiadu area was slightly relaxed compared to before. It is recalled that the British army stationed in the fortresses built by the British army at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road and at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Daxi Road. All situations were still calm. However, since the night before, the puppet police patrol team on Yuyuan Road has suddenly increased, with dozens of people in each team, moving back and forth frequently. In areas such as Kangnaidao Road, Laobusheng Road, and Yanping Road, there are still Chinese and foreign detectives checking pedestrians and vehicles, and armored vehicles Nos. 3 and 5 are constantly patrolling the area. As for Columbia Road and Anhesi Road, the police station has dispatched detectives to be stationed next to the locations where the puppet police are deployed. The British army rides in two patrol cars, four in each car, with machine guns mounted on top, patrolling day and night. The situation on Haige Road all the way to Xujiahui Lujia Road is similar to the past.</p>
<p>Middle School for Refugee Children Continues as Usual</p>
<p>The Shanghai Private Middle School for Refugee Children sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, saying: "Regarding the report in your newspaper a few days ago about the incident of cross-border road construction, which stated that the No. 11 and No. 31 refugee shelters and the Middle School for Refugee Children on Jisi Feier Road were forced to relocate, there is some discrepancy with the facts. Students' families and people who care about our school have troubled us with letters, calls, and personal visits. We would like to report the detailed situation as follows: According to our school, during the summer vacation, we built a bamboo hut on the vacant land behind the Sheng's Ancestral Hall Western-style house on Jisi Feier Road and moved in at the end of August to start school. Later, due to the No. 31 refugee shelter relocating the houses, at the beginning of this month, all the refugees from the shelter temporarily lived in the classrooms of all levels of our school and other separate houses. At that time, our school continued to have classes in the dining hall, office, and reception room. Since the 28th of this month, the refugees from the No. 31 refugee shelter have moved successively to the No. 1 refugee shelter on Dunxin Road, and the school has returned to its original state. We believe that our school is a school that provides relief to young people who have dropped out of school and are not cared for. The funding and tuition fees of the charity are still allocated as usual. Under the condition that this piece of land behind the landlord's house is not hindered, we can always maintain this only refugee education institution in Shanghai. In order to avoid causing misunderstandings from the outside world, we hereby make the above report."</p>
<p>The Ability of the Puppet Police is Extremely Weak</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported: "According to eyewitnesses, just after 1:00 AM today (the 30th), a car rented from a certain well-known automobile company in this city sped past the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road. The people in the car suddenly fired several shots from the car window at the 'Avenue' police stationed at the intersection. The puppet police immediately abandoned their posts upon hearing the gunshots and fled to nearby houses to hide. The car continued to speed away. There were no casualties afterwards. The number of people in the car could not be determined. Another report said that the 'Avenue Police' in the western district of Shanghai exchanged gunfire with three or four gangsters carrying guns in a car at 1:00 AM yesterday morning. It is reported that a car from a well-known automobile company in this city approached the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road. At that time, it was 1:00 AM in the morning. The number of people in the car is unknown, while the 'Avenue Police' were patrolling in the vicinity and ordered them to stop. Immediately, both sides opened fire. The gangsters in the car fired out the window at the 'Avenue Police.' It is heard that the car body was hit by bullets, and then they escaped."</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in the Suburbs Take Defensive Positions at Night; Chinese Troops Gradually Approach; Japanese on High Alert</h3>
<p>Rumors are rampant in the suburbs of Shanghai. Chinese troops from neighboring counties are gradually approaching the city, and the situation is tense, as if war is imminent. In the Pudong area, it is rumored that plainclothes agents are lurking there, preparing to act as internal support. The Japanese troops, who used to return to their teams at night and not come out, are now deploying the navy and army fully armed to the main roads after 10:00 PM every night, setting up machine guns, and taking emergency precautions, with no peace throughout the night, until they retreat at dawn.</p>
<h3>Today is the Final Settlement Date for Long-Term Credit Loans: Few Loan Transactions Completed</h3>
<p>The business of Shanghai's exchange and money shops is mainly based on credit loans. Long-term loans are called "Six Pairs." The end of April and the end of October each year are the start and end dates. Today is the only final settlement date for long-term loans in October. All loans that should be repaid were subject to a large-scale final decision in yesterday's market. Each shop allowed flexible extensions for loans that were due and allowed as much new lending as possible. However, this October is very different from before the war. The amount of loans due is not as large as in the distant past, and not many new loans have been completed. Therefore, October is only a historical term from the past, so the financial situation is still not tense.</p>
<p>Flexible Extensions, Separate IOUs</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the money industry yesterday that the 41 exchange shops had a total of 10 million yuan in loans due. Flexible extensions were granted to old customers with good credit, with the exception of clearing all due interest. New IOUs were signed, with terms ranging from one month to six months.</p>
<p>Few New Credit Loans Completed</p>
<p>Regarding the new credit loans, after the shops allowed as much lending as possible, as a result of negotiations between various factories, companies, and firms and the shops, it is heard that a total of 1 to 2 million yuan were completed in October, with interest rates ranging from 9 yuan to 12 yuan. Factories accounted for the most, with 1 million yuan, and there were also silk, northern goods, and sugar industries. As for the shops in Hankou and Ningbo, they also used to lend credit long-term loans in Shanghai, but they stopped lending after the war and tried to recover the loans previously made. Therefore, in this October, the Yong and Han shops did not make any new loans, only old customers transferred accounts, totaling 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Long-Term Deposits, Separate Interest Settlements</p>
<p>Each shop re-increased the price separately based on the domestic market price for long-term deposits. This year's domestic market price in October was 5 yuan and 5 jiao, and the price increase in each shop ranged from 5 jiao to 2 yuan. This interest was settled until the end of October. As for the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks, they did their best to provide discounts to save the market. However, this type of lending was mainly based on collateral and had no credit lending at all. By the end of October, the loan balance was more than 16 million yuan, 80% of which was lent directly by the association, and 20% was transferred by the silver and money industries' preparatory committee's treasury, aiming to adjust the finances of each bank and shop.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Area A of North Suzhou Creek is Becoming More Serious; Japanese Military Police, Together with Chinese "Military Police Assistants," Secretly Deploy Posts and Implement Emergency Precautions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in Area A of North Suzhou Creek and the Hongkou area within the barbed wire fence became more tense. The Japanese Military Police Headquarters dispatched a large number of military police, together with Chinese military police assistants, who were divided into teams and deployed at posts with strict precautions. Each team of Japanese military police consisted of more than a dozen people, each led by a lower-ranking officer wearing a sword. There was one team at the Sichuan Road Bridge, one team at the Haining Road intersection, and other places such as Wusong Road, Zhabu Road, Wenjianshi Road, Bazi Road, Haining Road, Henghong Road, and Disiwei Road were all full of posts, with a post every ten steps and a sentry every five steps. Pedestrians and vehicles passing by had to be searched and questioned before being allowed to pass. At the same time, the openings in the barbed wire fence at the Haining Road intersection and the Wenjianshi Road intersection were more strictly checking passes for pedestrians entering. According to a reporter from Daguang News Agency, the reason for the Japanese side taking the above emergency precautions is said to be to prevent anti-Japanese elements from mixing in and causing trouble. Another rumor is that the Chinese army guerrilla forces are approaching the suburbs of Shanghai, and the Japanese and puppet sides feel extremely panicked, so they have implemented emergency precautions in the area.</p>
<p>Crossing the Bridge is Exceptionally Troublesome</p>
<p>Dazhong News Agency reported that there are several bridges connecting Hongkou and Zhabei in the special area. The rules for passing through each bridge are different. For example, the Waibaidu Bridge and the Sichuan Road Bridge allow vehicles and pedestrians to pass through, and the time for passing through is from 5:00 AM to 2:00 AM. The Gubaidu Bridge and the Xinzha Bridge only allow pedestrians to pass through, and the time for passing through is from 5:00 AM to 8:00 PM. The Wuzhen Road Bridge only allows vehicles to pass through, and the time for passing through is the same as the above two bridges. In the middle of each bridge, British and Japanese troops face each other. At the Waibaidu Bridge and the Sichuan Road Bridge, the number of Japanese troops, Japanese police, British troops, British police, and Chinese police has increased. In addition to the Japanese troops, there are also several puppet troops at the Xinzha Bridge and the Wuzhen Road Bridge. Pedestrians passing through must salute, present their passes, and show their belongings. The trouble of the procedure is no different from entering a foreign country.</p>
<p>The Scenery North of the Boundary Road is Desolate</p>
<p>The British army post at the end of North Henan Road faces the Japanese army post north of the boundary road from afar. At the place where Baoshan Road turns into Fusheng Road, a Japanese man is directing several Chinese people to demolish a house. The barbed wire fence on the boundary road starts from Baoshan Road and runs straight to North Zhejiang Road. East of the barbed wire fence, concession police patrol back and forth. North of the barbed wire fence, Japanese troops are stationed there. The Two-Road Administration Bureau, riddled with bullet holes, has been occupied by the Japanese army. The bullet holes and dilapidated windows are covered with wooden boards. Looking west at the Early Bridge, there are no pedestrians.</p>
<p>Japanese Posts Amidst Spreading Weeds</p>
<p>There is a British soldier stationed at the intersection of North Xizang Road and Kaifeng Road, and there is also a British soldier stationed at the Mud City Bridge. When the reporter passed by the place, he saw a truck driving to the place, delivering food to the small house where the British army post was located. Because there is a small team of British troops stationed there year-round. Barbed wire fences are densely surrounded from the Mud City Bridge to the end of North Xizang Road. West of the barbed wire fence, the view is desolate. Outside the broken walls and ruins, there are winding weeds. The Japanese military post is built in the midst of these weeds. The pavilion is built of old bricks and charred wood. The reporter saw two Japanese soldiers talking to each other from afar. The autumn wind is bleak, and the wild grass changes color. Is it also a place to mourn the ancient battlefield?</p>
<h3>Prices Soar, Reaching the Highest Peak; Various Industries Try to Suppress Them, but Have Not Achieved Their Goal</h3>
<p>Due to speculation by speculators, the fall of black market foreign exchange, control of production areas, poor transportation, and heavy taxes in the occupied areas, prices in Shanghai have soared unprecedentedly, reaching the highest peak in history, affecting the livelihoods of the entire people. Although various industries have tried to suppress them, they have not yet been realized due to environmental factors. The Shanghai wholesale price index is recorded as follows. Calculated with 1926 as 100%, the total index was 104.4 in 1927, 101.7 in 1928, 104.5 in 1929, 114.8 in 1930, 126.7 in 1931, 112.4 in 1932, 103.8 in 1933, 97.1 in 1934, 96.4 in 1935, 108.5 in 1936, and 129.1 in August 1938. It is heard that agricultural products were 130.7, animal products were 186.7, forest products were 164.8, mineral products were 265.5, manufactured products were 183.6, consumer goods were 156.3, food was 123.3, other foods were 185.6, textiles and their raw materials were 130.6, metals were 259.9, fuel was 263.0, construction materials were 169.2, chemicals were 215.9, and miscellaneous items were 142.5. As for the index for September and October of this year after the European War, it is heard that it is about 50% higher than the above index.</p>
<h3>Visa Extensions for German Goods in Detention Expected; Date to be Officially Announced Today; Hope that Cargo Owners Expedite Procedures</h3>
<p>Regarding the German, Czech, and Austrian goods belonging to Chinese merchants that are in detention waiting to be transferred to the Chinese mainland, after the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Haiphong sent personnel to Shanghai to negotiate with the French Consul General on the method of visa issuance for release, the cargo owners have all applied to the French Consulate for visas. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the transportation industry yesterday that the Haiphong authorities stipulated that</p>
<p>German, Austrian, and Czech goods shipped to Haiphong</p>
<p>before September 3 of this year must have a visa issued by the French Consul, stating that the goods have been paid in full, before they can be transferred. However, they must all be shipped out before October 31, otherwise they will be confiscated. Although the cargo owners have rushed to complete the visa procedures, in fact, it is definitely difficult to complete them as scheduled. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Haiphong has already made a</p>
<p>request for an extension</p>
<p>to the Haiphong authorities, and the Chinese Consul General Xu in Hanoi and the Chinese Consul Liu in Haiphong have requested the French authorities to approve an extension of the deadline to avoid losses to Chinese merchants. It is heard that the French authorities have agreed to consider and accept the principle of extension, but the date will be officially announced today. The Shanghai side has not yet received a detailed report, but it is hoped that all cargo owners must expedite the procedures as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Language Exhibition - Valuable Exhibits Arrive - Besides Exhibits, There Will Be Performances - Aimed at Popularizing and Studying Language Education</h3>
<p>The Language Exhibition, initiated by prominent figures in society and cultural circles of this city, has been preparing since the end of September. Various circles believe that the association is of great significance in language education, and they have successively sent treasured and valuable exhibits for display. A reporter visited Mr. Huang Zhaoping, a member of the organizing committee, yesterday. According to him, the valuable items received so far include Jin Zutong's</p>
<p>Huge Pieces of Oracle Bone</p>
<p>Various dialect versions of the Bible from the Bible Society, palm-leaf scriptures from the Buddhist Bookstore, handwritten scriptures by the Panchen Lama from Qian Huafo, and edicts in Han, Mongolian, and Manchu scripts from the Qianlong, Yongzheng, and Kangxi dynasties. Also, Zhang Zonglin's Tibetan scriptures written in pure gold, Zhou Yueran's Song and Yuan versions of various national indigenous scripts, and Ding Fubao's</p>
<p>Ancient Coins from Before the Qin Dynasty</p>
<p>etc. Many other valuable exhibits will be sent during the exhibition and displayed in a special room. During the exhibition period, there will be performances such as blind children learning to read, new script learning, and dialect pronunciation. Language experts Ding Fubao, Chen Wangdao, Zhou Jiaoqing and other gentlemen will take turns</p>
<p>Give Lectures</p>
<p>So that all sectors of society can gain a clear understanding of the historical evolution and development of Chinese language. The association will hold the exhibition at the Daxon Department Store exhibition hall, opening on November 3rd, lasting for ten days. Tickets are 50 cents each, but student groups can get a 50% discount. It is also heard that if the association has more income, it plans to establish a language library, so it hopes that all sectors will give more support.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Applying for Vietnamese Transit Passports -渝領港簽省時節費 (Saving Time and Money with Chongqing Application and Hong Kong Visa) - Can Depart from Shanghai in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, those traveling to the interior have been taking the route through Vietnam. Regarding the application for passports, the China Travel Service first applies to Chongqing on behalf of the applicant, at a cost of 8 yuan in national currency (12 yuan for those entering the country). However, due to the long distance and postal delays, it takes at least three to several weeks to receive the passport. Then, applying for a visa from the French Consulate in Shanghai takes another one to two weeks. Therefore, it takes more than a month in total to be able to travel.</p>
<p>Those Who are Anxious to Travel</p>
<p>have no choice but to apply to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong. The fee, including the French consulate visa, is 11 Hong Kong dollars per copy, and it is possible to depart from Shanghai after ten days. However, the general economic class finds this cost too expensive. Recently, according to a reporter's inquiry, the China Travel Service, in order to</p>
<p>Facilitate Travel</p>
<p>in addition to still handling quick photos for Hong Kong, has negotiated with all parties. All passports entrusted to the company to be applied for in Chongqing will be sent directly to its branch in Hong Kong after being signed out by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Hong Kong branch will immediately apply for a visa from the French Consul in Hong Kong. In this way, passengers can</p>
<p>Depart from Shanghai to the South in Two Weeks</p>
<p>When passing through Hong Kong, they can exchange for a passport with the company's letter. In terms of fees (including airmail), border passports are 20 yuan in national currency per copy, and those entering the country are 50 yuan in national currency (both include visa fees). The above costs are more than one-third cheaper than those calculated in Hong Kong dollars for Hong Kong passports, and the time is not too long. It is indeed a great benefit to travelers.</p>
<h3>Misfortune of British Church Hospitals in Occupied Areas of North China - 15 Out of 23 Hospitals Closed in Gansu - All as a Result of Anti-British Agitation</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, 15 of the 23 British church hospitals in the occupied areas of North China have been completely closed due to anti-British agitation. Five hospitals without British staff are still working, and no news has been received from the other three for some time. From this, the seriousness of the situation can be seen. Among the hospitals that have been completely closed, the Universal Hospital in Zhangde, Henan, had its gate burned and was attacked with hand grenades. The Universal Hospital in Kaifeng was closed by anti-British activists. Before the St. Andrew's Hospital in Hejian, Hebei, was closed, a mob killed four hospital staff and detained two Britons. In the Universal Hospital in Taian, Shandong, British staff have been expelled.</p>
<h3>Ashes of Japanese Soldiers - Batch 53 -</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, a batch of ashes of Japanese officers and soldiers who died in Central China due to battle deaths, serious injuries, or illness arrived yesterday morning (29th) at the Yangshupu Wharf of the Dalian Steamship Company. A Japanese transport ship carried them back to Japan. Japanese adults and schoolchildren in Shanghai gathered at the wharf to pay their respects. According to Japanese newspapers, this is the 53rd batch of Japanese soldiers' ashes to be transported back to Japan since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Set Up a Security Line in Yangshupu</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, Japanese troops set up a security line on Yangshupu Road between Huishan Road and Macleod Road this morning (30th), preventing vehicles and pedestrians from passing through, presumably because a Japanese prince was passing through the area to board a ship back to Japan. Traffic was only allowed to return to normal at 10:45 am. It is reported that the prince came to Shanghai to inspect the war zone. When he arrived in Shanghai yesterday (29th), the Japanese army made similar preparations, but there was no prior announcement of the prince's arrival in Shanghai or the establishment of the security line.</p>
<p>The Chinese government continues to make the strongest possible efforts in transportation because China needs more railways, more and better highways, and improvements in river navigation for military, political, and economic reasons. There has been great progress in this regard in recent months. The transportation capacity of the French railway from Haiphong to Kunming has increased fourfold compared to a year ago when Guangzhou and Hankou successively fell. Although transportation capacity still needs to be greatly increased, the achievements already made by this French railway deserve enthusiastic congratulations. In the not-too-distant future, "Free China" will have another railway transportation line to Vietnam.</p>
<p>Various new railways in Guangxi are now progressing rapidly. The laying of the railway line connecting Zhennanguan on the Vietnamese border with Nanning is expected to be completed early next year. The new railway from Guilin to Liuzhou began regular traffic earlier this month. There is now full traffic from Liuzhou to Hengyang, connecting the central areas of Guangxi and Hunan provinces. The last railway in Guangxi connecting Liuzhou and Nanning is under construction, and earthwork has mostly been completed.</p>
<p>Railway construction in Yunnan Province is also progressing. The Chinese government has temporarily abandoned the plan to build a railway along the entire Yunnan-Burma Road and is concentrating its efforts on laying a railway from Kunming along the northern edge of the central Yunnan mountains to Xiaguan. This section of the project is easier and will allow all the means of transportation that are currently busy traveling on the highway between Kunming via Xiaguan in transit and Lashio to be concentrated between Lashio and Xiaguan. The route planned to connect Kunming and Xufu in the north is also being started, but recently the focus has been on the completion of the new highway going north not to Xufu but to Luzhou, which was completed and opened on schedule earlier this month, organized by a French banking group, using no less than 500 new French Renault trucks.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, the Chinese government no longer permits the publication of news about the industrial development of "Free China," but the recent lack of such news should not be taken as a sign that the establishment of new industries and the re-establishment of old industries within "Free China" is slowing down. In fact, in recent months, there has been great progress in expanding factories for military and metal engineering, and in mining coal, iron, and other minerals. Machinery imported for these purposes occupies an important position in "Free China's" imports. Private enterprises are mostly devoted to the establishment of food and textile industries. Newly established industrial cooperatives, although not yet of comparable importance to formal industries, are developing satisfactorily. Industrial cooperatives now employ more than 25,000 workers, working in more than 600 industrial cooperative factories, some of which have reached the scope and productivity of large-scale industries. For example, one of them can produce 200 light machine guns per week. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Customs Water Police to Take Over Floating Docks - Originally, the Municipal Council Managed Police Affairs - In the Future, the Water Police Will Take Over</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, according to news from this port last night (29th), the Customs Water Police will take over full police management of the various floating docks at the Bund Customs Wharf from Wednesday. These docks are the landing place for passengers coming to Shanghai from overseas and the boarding place for passengers going to foreign ports. Previously, the police authority was managed by the Municipal Council's police department. It is heard that in the future, Chinese and foreign personnel from the Water Police will take over this task, and a foreign police officer will be stationed at the floating dock at all times. However, this statement was not officially confirmed last night.</p>
<h3>Relief Association's Introduction Group Actively Promotes</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that refugees in various shelters have nothing to do but eat and sleep, which can easily lead to laziness, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has established a job introduction group, with Li Wenjie as the director and Li Baiqiang as the deputy director. It also joins forces with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, the Municipal Council's industrial department, and various commercial factories and companies to give priority to employing refugees, turning dividends into production, so that each can become self-reliant and make a living. Since its establishment, it has introduced about 500 refugees to employment. However, the association currently provides for more than 40,000 refugees, some of whom, after being introduced to a job, have low wages during the trial and learning period, and have difficulty returning to the shelter on time due to inconvenient transportation, suffering from hunger, which often leads to them stopping work halfway. It is now heard that the association's board of directors recently decided at a meeting that in the future, all refugees introduced to jobs by the job introduction group, such as those in the learning and trial period, will be given a subsidy of four yuan per month by the association to show encouragement, but only for three months, so that all refugees can live independently after three months and no longer rely on the support of charitable organizations. This kind of active relief through work for relief should be welcomed and supported by people in society, and it is hoped that all sectors will go directly to the association at 93 Guangdong Road or call 12669 when they need labor. The female citizens introduced by the association all have letters of proof, and those who need guarantees can also be handled as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Opening of Luzhou-Kunming Highway</h3>
<p>The highway from Luzhou in Sichuan (on the north bank of the Yangtze River in southwestern Sichuan) through Guizhou Province to Kunming is reported to have opened on the 15th of this month. If this is true, the freight transport between Chongqing and Kunming will be shorter by more than 300 li via the Luzhou-Kunming Highway than before via the Chongqing-Kunming Highway, and the time can be faster by two days. The freight cost can be reduced by about 300 yuan per ton.</p>

<h3>After Being Blackmailed, They Were Attacked with Bombs - The Case Has a Serial Nature - The Arrested Criminal Must Be Detained for Further Investigation - Verdict Announced Yesterday in the Blackmail Case of Yuelai Store Owner</h3>
<p>Wu Wengui, the owner of Hong Changshun South Goods Store at 115 Hubei Road, received a blackmail letter on the morning of the 20th of this month, with two bullets attached, attempting to extort 1,000 yuan. He was contacted by phone in the afternoon, and at 7 pm, a phone call came to negotiate. As a result, they reached an agreement for</p>
<p>700 Yuan</p>
<p>The place of payment was agreed to be at the Changzhou Theater in the Tianyunlou Amusement Park on the afternoon of the 21st. Wu reported to the Old Police Station, and Chinese detectives Zhang Keqin, Qiu Sijiu, and others rushed there and arrested a local man named Chen Herui, who was handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. On the 25th of the month, a</p>
<p>Iron Can Was Found</p>
<p>at the entrance of Wu Wengui's residence at 61 Renji Lane, Xinza Road, filled with explosives. Fortunately, it was discovered early and did not explode. Wu reported to the police station for investigation. To his surprise, at 10:30 pm the night before, a bomb was suddenly thrown at Wu's residence, which exploded but fortunately did not injure anyone. Yesterday morning, the First Special Court's judge Feng Shide continued the hearing of the case of sending blackmail letters to extort money in a criminal court. The police lawyer Ru Baozhen said that the case is now</p>
<p>Serially Related</p>
<p>to unexpected incidents and is still under investigation. Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the case again. Judge Feng approved the report and ordered Chen Herui to be detained and rescheduled for questioning. (Another trial) Gong Fanglai, the owner of Yuelai South Goods Store at 356 Guangdong Road, who had previously been blackmailed and bombed for selling enemy goods, recently received a signed</p>
<p>Threatening Letter</p>
<p>from Li Zhibu, the captain of the 15th, 16th, and 17th platoons of the 13th Brigade of the Zhongyi Army in the Sujia District, attempting to extort 500 yuan. He reported to the Old Zha Police Station, and Chinese detectives Xue Youwen, Xu Fusheng, Huang Cifu, and others arrested the criminal Feng Shiyi, who was handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing of the case in a criminal court. The police lawyer Ru Baozhen stated that during the postponement, experts identified the threatening letter received by the plaintiff as being written by</p>
<p>The Defendant</p>
<p>Under questioning by Judge Feng, the defendant's lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang argued on behalf of the defendant, saying that the defendant was not yet 17 years old and lacked intelligence. They requested the court to give a lenient sentence to allow him to reform. Judge Feng sentenced Feng Shiyi to six months in prison and sent him to a reformatory for six months of moral education. If he is indeed of good character and has no faults after the reform period, the sentence may be exempted from execution.</p>
<h3>Leader of the Zhoujiaqiao Puppet Police Corps Shot to Death Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhang Miaoquan, the cousin of Zhang Xiaodi (a tofu shop owner from Longhua), the head of the Zhoujiaqiao puppet "Autonomous Association" in western Shanghai, is 32 years old this year. Recently, someone appointed Zhang as the head of the Zhoujiaqiao puppet "Self-Defense Corps," using the alias Zhang Qi. At about 4 pm yesterday, Zhang was walking home from a bathhouse, near the puppet corps headquarters, when two burly men suddenly jumped out and shot Zhang in the head. Zhang was unable to dodge and fell to the ground, his brains splattered, and died on the spot. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the burly men calmly escaped.</p>
<h3>Body in a Box Discovered on Wuchang Road, Hongkou - The Body Was Decomposed and Had Been Dead for Many Days</h3>
<p>A wooden box was discovered on the side of the road near the Higashi Honganji Temple on Wuchang Road, Hongkou, at 11 am the day before yesterday (29th). Upon opening it, a male corpse was found inside, with a decomposed face, and believed to have been dead for a week. However, it is unknown who killed him and where the body came from, and an investigation is currently underway. A young man named Feng Zeyong lost his entire family's life and property in the battle of Shanghai. Although he escaped into the concession, he was alone and without relatives. He planned to commit suicide by throwing himself into the Huangpu River. When he went to the Bund to throw himself into the river, he saw two Japanese people waiting for a ship at the wharf. He suddenly remembered the national hatred and family grievances, and pushed the two Japanese people into the river, and then threw himself into the river, intending to die together. However, all three were rescued. The police considered Feng's actions to be an attempted murder and brought him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, after questioning by Judge Feng Shide, Feng Zeyong was sentenced for attempted murder to two years in prison, with six months of moral education first. If he is indeed of good character and has no faults after the reform period, the sentence may be exempted from execution.</p>
<h3>Dong Yunshu, Accountant of Huaxing Cotton Weaving Factory, Kidnapped - A Trainee from a Car Company Suspected and Detained</h3>
<p>Chen Xiaobao from Wuxi, an 18-year-old trainee at the Huainan Automobile Company at 365 Avenue Foch, was detained by the Jing'an Temple Road Police and prosecuted by the First Special Court for allegedly helping kidnappers kidnap Dong Yunshu, the chief accountant of the Huaxing Cotton Weaving Factory at 44 Caobang Road, Yidingpan Road, Daxilu. After a trial by Judge Chuan Lin, it was ruled that</p>
<p>Jurisdiction is Incorrect</p>
<p>The case was not accepted, and the defendant was released on bail and transferred to the Second Special Court for trial. Recently, the French Police Department summoned Chen Xiaobao for investigation and prosecuted him for aiding and abetting kidnapping for ransom. Judge Zhang Minsheng presided over the hearing in a criminal court yesterday. According to the defendant Chen Xiaobao's confession, on June 27th of this year, Liu Dafu, a Korean youth residing in Hongkou, came to our Huainan Company to purchase an old vehicle and drove it to the road for a test drive. Because he did not have a permit, he took the No. 1368 permit that was hanging on the wall, hung it on the car, and test-drove it. Unexpectedly, he never returned. It was not until 4 pm on the 30th of this month that he returned the permit to us. He used this permit to commit the kidnapping case, and I knew nothing about it. I request the court to</p>
<p>Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>Judge Zhang said, "Who does the No. 1368 permit in your company belong to?" Chen replied, "It belongs to Wang Ziping, a trauma doctor at No. 5, Lane 23, Avenue Foch. Because his car was entrusted to us for sale, he did not return the car permit to the car service department." According to Detective Xu Jinlong, who handled the case, the kidnapping occurred at 10 am on June 30th. The kidnappers originally intended to kidnap Dong Gengsheng, the manager of Huaxing, but because he was not there, they kidnapped the accountant Dong Yunshu. Now that the No. 1368 car permit has been copied from Huainan, the defendant is naturally suspected of aiding and abetting a major crime. The court verified the confessions and ruled that the case be postponed to November 8th for further hearing.</p>
<p>The Local Ruffians of Qibao Brought to Justice</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported a case of "one dead and one injured in a shooting in western Qibao Town." A letter from Chen Zhengkui, the captain of the Second Battalion of the Songjiang Reserve Regiment of Jiangsu Province, reported that the facts were largely inconsistent. According to him, the two bandits brought to justice, Wang Zhonggao and Zhang Hansheng, were unemployed local ruffians from Qibao Town who had been engaged in robbery since the war, posing as national soldiers and causing trouble. Since the regiment was ordered to move to the area, it ordered its subordinates to pay attention and take the opportunity to bring them to justice. The bandits happened to rob travelers the other day, so they were immediately rounded up, and the bandits were eventually brought to justice.</p>
<h3>A Juvenile Russian Thief - Extremely Naughty - Even Accused His Mother of Assault</h3>

Someone reported to the French police, who arrested two Chinese men and one woman, along with the banknotes, and brought them to the police station. On one hand, the Chinese robbers Li Yongjin, Shi Baozhang, and Shi Zhangshi were sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. These details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that after the Russian boy Gonglang Guweike returned home, he was reprimanded by his stepmother Gonglang Gubanna (transliteration, 25 years old, living in Room 6, Lane 22, Dalinli, Avenue Joffre) the day before yesterday. She accidentally broke the boy's forehead during the reprimand, and blood flowed like a river. The boy reported to the French police, accusing his mother of assault. The police chief summoned his mother to the station for interrogation. Yesterday, she was transferred to Criminal Court No. 8 of the Second Special Court and prosecuted for assault. Judge Qiu presided over the trial. The plaintiff Gonglang Guweike recounted the process of being beaten by his mother, and said that he did not want to sue now. The defendant Gonglang Gubanna admitted that she accidentally assaulted him while reprimanding him, but said that the child was very naughty and his father was still in his hometown in Russia. After verifying the confessions, the court gave some guidance to the defendant and ordered the plaintiff to have his injuries examined before being taken back by the defendant. The hearing was rescheduled for November 3rd.</p>

<h3>Excerpts from Thinking and Seeing</h3>
<p>— Shi Qiang</p>
<p>1. Filtering</p>
<p>In my mind, a clump of weeds suddenly grows, desolate, almost like disappearing; I can't find even a small path, a disappointment!</p>
<p>But the encouraging torch, inlaid with the glittering sparks of hope, casts light through the floating sediment, revealing the dust in the corners of the walls; let these things "flow eastward with the great river"; turn back and welcome, welcome that "comeback."</p>
<p>Here, all the "thinking" of the dead is removed, encircled, suppressed, and set on fire, hoping it will spread like wildfire; the mind is swept into a "barren land," and then a defensive line is built against the chaos of animal husbandry.</p>
<p>The original purpose of extracting thoughts is to see clearly, to draw out new shoots, perhaps even sparking inner guilt. However, after peeling off one or more layers, not only does one feel lost, but no one has answered this diverse mystery.</p>
<p>Forget it! Isn't "drawing firewood from under the pot" good? To stop the boiling heat of the heart. No—this is not something that can be firmly stopped by removing the firewood.</p>
<p>If the thoughts extracted can be layered more, perhaps narrow-mindedness, even absurdity and absurdity, will be accelerated and transformed; peeling off one or two layers, peeling off until "no preconceptions remain," peeling off until "embracing emptiness like a valley"; peeling off until even a huge camel can pass through the eye of a needle.</p>
<p>Perhaps humanity has long ago arranged a very proper and utterly confused "model," which not only cannot be passively "followed," but also requires multi-faceted pulling and peeling, although the throat of triumph has not been opened, and the utilitarian waves are eroding the earth's crust so much!</p>
<p>2. Earth and Sun</p>
<p>At first, when you see earth, it's just a dull gray thing. Flat fields, three-dimensional, piled full of pits and valleys, and a not very pleasant smell floats over; on the lips of mankind, in piles of old and new papers, you find the two contemptuous adjectives "dung and earth"!</p>
<p>Go a step further, or be a little more patient, do you see? One by one, the seeds turn over, which is a very common thing. A little taste! A little taste! Can even these words be spoken and be worthy of a grand hall?</p>
<p>The ultimate in ordinariness, perhaps novelty will follow; when you see it for the third time, the facts tell you that "survival of the fittest" is at work here, with a balance scale that eliminates the dross and preserves the essence, using two extremely small leaves to hoist a sign that says "ten years to grow trees."</p>
<p>Enough—no, politicians gather to discuss the three essential elements of founding a country, one, then another, and this vast "land" that even the strength to lift a tripod cannot shake.</p>
<p>Alas! The words were said a little too late, hasn't a layer already been blown away by the wind? Isn't it already charred?</p>
<p>Perhaps, the extreme of being blown away is the scraping, and the essence of being charred is the ripening; it serves you right! Rather than saying "humans slaughter each other," it is better to say "the fate of the earth is renewed." A thousand or ten thousand people pass by, not noticing these dull, odorless things; this time, it is this time, those charred, floating, or small pieces, large pieces, holes, mounds, and even batches of them, or those that have turned ochre under the ruined walls, make up a "Only Earth Theory" that people cannot write so intimately!</p>
<p>In this great work, the first chapter clearly expounds "Central Plains Re-manufacturing Good Land"!</p>
<p>Look! Thick smoke is rising, that's the refining work.</p>
<p>The floating soil is swept away, and the essence remains; even when it is charred, the old farmers often say a few words that are quite thought-provoking, although there is no other meaning mixed in at all.</p>
<p>"If the soil is not burned, the insects will not be destroyed, and the crops will not be easily harvested; cooked soil is better for planting than raw soil."</p>
<p>How will this explain our current actions?</p>
<h3>At the Graduation Party</h3>
<p>— Ye Cai</p>
<p>Gathered in northern Shaanxi,</p>
<p>Studying at the Public School,</p>
<p>Forged the backbone of resistance,</p>
<p>Taking up arms for a test;</p>
<p>Encountering the enemy,</p>
<p>Slaughtering them until petals fly like catkins.</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Public School graduated the students of the third, fourth, and fifth teams. On a starry and moonlit night, at the foot of that vast mountain, a large group of newly arrived, still studying, and newly graduated students stood. This was their grand farewell party for the graduating students.</p>
<p>Several dim candlelight, merged with the silver-gray moonlight, reflected them as so excited and joyful. Before the bell rang to start the meeting, songs had already soared into the high sky and deep valleys, with a tone that was both tragic and heroic: "There is nothing to worry about, even if there is some nostalgia." The alma mater gave them so much richness, "Knowledge is never easy to obtain completely, only to be tempered in work."</p>
<p>When the singing stopped, Principal Cheng Fangwu opened the prelude to this grand meeting. His short figure received thunderous applause from the students on the stage. He was there to give the graduating students his final speech. Here, another large group of anti-Japanese cadres had been cultivated, and a part of President Chiang's hopes had been fulfilled: "To achieve the original purpose of education with methods of extraordinary times, and to expand the effect of education with extraordinary spirit." Principal Cheng Fangwu was full of smiles and enthusiasm when he gave his speech. Next, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Kang Sheng gave speeches one after another! These were all action guidelines for the graduating students, so that everyone could have a clue when they went out to work.</p>
<p>The student union came to distribute fruits and snacks, which was also when the students staying at the school sent off the graduating students with recreational programs. In this snowy and windy day, cracking walnuts, peeling peanuts, chewing sesame candy, and watching plays and dances, everyone forgot the cold. In this lively atmosphere, they talked and laughed, sharing farewells, tasting the reunion on the front line, for the unparalleled grievances of the Chinese nation, to avenge the heavy pressure in their hearts, only waiting for the bugle call in tomorrow's dawn, to bravely go to war.</p>
<p>How exciting, in the vigorous atmosphere of the meeting: every comrade's blood was surging, they could hardly hold back, their hearts were active and galloping.</p>
<p>After a long time, they rested for a while, and in their thoughts, an extreme light suddenly flickered: "In a few days, rushing to the battlefield, we must strive for the final victory, sacrificing ourselves in exchange."</p>
<h3>Between the Lines</h3>
<p>— Kang Min</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper under the lamplight.</p>
<p>The surroundings are so quiet, the autumn wind outside the window is beating against the swaying window glass. But my heart is warm.</p>
<p>I am still reading my newspaper, and I smell the fragrance of spring between the lines!</p>
<p>Suddenly, I discovered a small, yellow ant, so hasty and flustered, rushing around on the newspaper. But I was not merciful at all. I casually used the index finger of my right hand to gently pinch this small creature. The small, yellow body immediately curled up and contorted. I just gave it a contemptuous smile from my nostrils:</p>
<p>"Useless thing!"</p>
<p>So, I read my newspaper again. Autumn was still beating against the window sill in vain, and I gave it the same contemptuous sneer.</p>
<p>In less than five minutes, in the middle of these densely packed small-sized lead characters, I saw the corpse of that small, yellow ant again, being carried in the mouth of another small, yellow ant. This living one was also hasty and flustered, rushing around in the middle of these densely packed lead characters.</p>
<p>Seeing this tragic scene, my heart felt like it had been stabbed by a sharp awl, and I was extremely pained! I regretted my cruel and violent act just now, and I deeply loathed the bestial and cruel dregs left in my soul. How could I not for such a small animal? I am not a believer in Buddhism, blindly protecting all life. But tonight, I cannot help but feel respect for this small ant, and I want to protect their lives!</p>
<p>I painfully watched this small, yellow ant, carrying the corpse of its companion in its mouth, so hastily and flusteredly walking away from this maze of densely packed small-sized lead characters—walking out of the newspaper and heading straight to the corner of the wall.</p>
<p>I watched them leave, and when my eyes turned back to the newspaper, "Ten sections safely passed, and the conscription of winter clothing is extremely enthusiastic," and another subtitle: "Various banks were quite busy yesterday collecting payments, and should be able to raise the full amount before the end of the month." These lead characters were all becoming active. I hurriedly tried to find that small, yellow, respectable ant again, but there was no trace of it.</p>
<p>Small, yellow things are even more sublime in the face of "man"!</p>
<p>I stood up, moved the books on the table, and faced the gray corner of the wall. I wanted to find them back, I wanted to give them my most sincere salute!</p>

<h3>Bala</h3>
<p>— Translated by Pin Pin, written by M. Bouchor</p>
<p>Listen to me tell the story of a hero:</p>
<p>This hero sacrificed his youth for his country.</p>
<p>His appearance was handsome and solemn,</p>
<p>Only thirteen years old, his heart was like that of an adult.</p>
<p>He was a brave little cavalryman,</p>
<p>Galloping on the battlefield, sword light flashing, only moving forward.</p>
<p>But when he wrote a tactful letter to his loving mother,</p>
<p>He was filled with filial piety.</p>
<p>The enemy charged.</p>
<p>They were brutes, ignorant people,</p>
<p>They simply didn't know right from wrong,</p>
<p>They were all bastards...</p>
<p>This day, he was about to lead a few horses to drink water,</p>
<p>When this lone child was surrounded by more than twenty enemies.</p>
<p>"Your horse!" "No!" "Give it here!" "Bullshit!" The enemies were furious.</p>
<p>Bala knew that death had come.</p>
<p>But why did this group of fools</p>
<p>Intend to kill but suddenly fail to raise their knives?</p>
<p>Scimitars, longswords, spears,</p>
<p>Wavered in front of the child...</p>
<p>One of the strong men in this group of murderers,</p>
<p>Who was six feet tall, said to Bala: "I pity you very much.</p>
<p>Listen! We will let you go if you are willing</p>
<p>To shout in front of us: Long live the Emperor!"</p>
<p>Bala immediately thought of his mother,</p>
<p>He loved his kind mother very much,</p>
<p>His uneasy but proud mother</p>
<p>Was waiting for him to return for a kiss...</p>
<p>Suddenly, this brave child,</p>
<p>A bright light flashed in his pure and lively eyes,</p>
<p>And he shouted loudly: "Long live the Republic!"</p>
<p>He died under the enemy's knives.</p>
<p>Noble little knight;</p>
<p>Bright days have risen before you;</p>
<p>Your sacrifice is precisely for</p>
<p>Sacred freedom,</p>
<p>Worthy of admiration, little hero!</p>
<p>Like you, we love freedom,</p>
<p>If for freedom, our blood, our lives are needed,</p>
<p>You are a good example to teach us to die for our country!</p>

<h3>Globe Far East Manager's Report on Film Industry Inspection Upon Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Mr. A. E. Daff, the Far East manager of Universal Pictures, recently traveled around the world with his wife for a week to inspect the film industry in various countries, and took the opportunity to stay in Hollywood for a few days. The following is a report he gave to movie fans after his return, originally published in the English-language North China Star, which is now excerpted and translated for the readers of this publication.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the American film industry has not been affected in the slightest, and the quality has not decreased as a result.</p>
<p>Business in the</p>
<p>European Market</p>
<p>has declined slightly, but this phenomenon will not last forever.</p>
<p>During the last World War, the film industry, whether in the war zone or in places unaffected by the war, plummeted. This is not the case now. Take Spain during the civil war as an example. Although Barcelona was bombed several times a day, local cinemas still maintained normal operations, and each show was still crowded with people. The situation was the same in other places.</p>
<p>Cinemas in the United Kingdom and France were ordered to temporarily close at the beginning of this European war. Now, the people of both countries are petitioning the authorities so that cinemas in all areas, except for special military areas,</p>
<p>can reopen.</p>
<p>The official authorities have approved it. Speaking of Universal itself, it recently sent forty photographers to Europe, and dry plates were shipped directly from New York by plane. Therefore, any new developments regarding the European war can now be screened in New York within forty-eight hours.</p>
<p>Universal plans to spend 6 million gold dollars on filming this year, and Deanna Durbin's new film "It is—a Date" is not yet included, and it is estimated that the film will cost another million gold dollars. Other films of equal value that are being produced or have been completed include "Green Hell" starring Little Fan Bengke, Herbert Marshall, and Joan Bennett, "Destru" starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart, "La Chienne" starring Cary Grant, and new star Gloria Jean (see the first film "The Under Pup" in the October 7 issue of this publication) and "Invisible Man Return," "Tower of London," etc.</p>
<p>When Daff was in Hollywood, many stars asked him about the</p>
<p>recent situation in China.</p>
<p>Because they all wanted to travel to China once, and among them, the most sincere were the two singers Deanna Durbin and Gloria Jean. To say one more thing, Universal has decided on the films it plans to shoot next year, and there are a total of fifty-eight films.</p>
<h3>Wang Yaoqing Indeed Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Nan Qiang Bei Diao Ren</p>
<p>The news that the old court</p>
<p>performer Wang Yaoqing would come to Shanghai with his female disciple Wang Yurong (pictured) was first revealed in this newspaper. Readers were half in doubt. Until yesterday, Yaoqing indeed arrived, confirming that the news in this newspaper was not false. At 8:30 yesterday morning, the Shuntian Wheel docked. In addition to Sun Lanting and Wu Jiangfeng, important staff members from the front stage, those who went to welcome them included Jin Tingsun, the highest authority of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, Zhang Eyun, Furong Cao, Song Dezhu (the three of them are Yaoqing's disciples), and Wu Yanheng and Yang Baosen and his wife. Wang and others disembarked from the ship at about 9:00 and stayed at the Jin Mansion.</p>
<p>Those who came with them included Miss Tieying, Yaoqing's daughter, and the Wang Yurong troupe, Jin Zhongren and his wife, the clown Zhu Binxian, the painted-face Qiu Chengrong, the old female role Sun Futing, the old male role Li Shilin, and the steward Li Shaoting. That night, Jin Tingsun specially hosted a dinner at the Red Cotton Restaurant to welcome the group.</p>
<p>Among the aforementioned people, many are relatives. Jin Zhongren is the younger sister of Xiao Cuihua, Zhu Binxian is Qiu Shengrong's brother-in-law, and Yang Baosen is Wang Yaoqing's nephew. It was a pleasure to meet each other in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Wang Yaoqing has an eight-episode series of "Yanmen Pass." When he used to perform, Jin Zhongren played the eighth son. Yaoqing had taught this play to two female disciples, namely Zhang Eyun and Wang Yurong. Yurong needed to perform this play in public, so she specially asked Yaoqing to ask Zhongren to come with her. When this play is performed in the future, with this veteran Yang, the eighth son, it will definitely cause a sensation. (Zhang Eyun played this play this spring, and Ye Shengzha played the eighth son.)</p>
<p>Wang Yurong's program for the first three days of performance must be decided after consulting Yaoqing. With Yaoqing to oversee and plan everything, Yurong's success can be predicted. It is still too early to talk about the old court performer appearing on stage with us.</p>
<p>Last night, this humble person specially visited the old court performer at the Jin Mansion. Although he was tired from traveling, his spirit was still radiant, not as weak as the rumors said. He was wearing a camel-hair robe and a black mandarin jacket. He spoke to people calmly, but due to his age, he was already showing signs of aging. Wang Yurong, on the other hand, greeted people with a smiling face, and her charm was still as it was in those years, it is said.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Dance Party for the Dancers' Association</h3>
<p>— Tao Fulian</p>
<p>About two months ago, the Women's Dance Industry Association hosted the press at its clubhouse on Nanjing Road. The conversations of several key figures of the Dance Association, such as Wang Qinzhen, Ni Wenxian, and Yin Meifeng, gave people a very good impression. At that time, ways to raise funds were proposed, and a certain gentleman from this newspaper contributed the suggestion of holding a "Fundraising Luncheon Dance Party," which they adopted.</p>
<p>The Lido Ballroom was very lively at noon the day before yesterday: dancers, dance guests, and newspaper reporters were all gathered there, with a number of over two hundred people. There was no advertising done beforehand, and it was all up to the dancers to invite a few familiar dance guests to participate. At a quarter past twelve, Tang Qiaosi's orchestra began to play music. As the music started, the dancers immediately appeared to be in short supply.</p>
<p>There was no need for dance tickets for partnering, only a ticket for admission, each ticket costing ten yuan, which allowed you to dance with any dancer. This method was not only original in Shanghai but also very interesting. It is said that the income from this luncheon dance was more than 3,000 yuan, so the hard work of these thirty-odd dancers for two hours was worth it.</p>
<p>In the middle, there was Yin Meifeng's report, Wang Qinzhen, Ni Wenxian, and others' "Dance Association Song" chorus, and finally Wu Ying thanked the guests, and the words were very polite.</p>
<p>I think this method can be maintained, and it can be held in rotation at Paramount and Ciro's when necessary. Fortunately, the Dance Association will use the money it raises for the welfare of the dancers, and social sympathy should be no problem at all.</p>

<p>Columbia: Joan Blondell, Jean Arthur.</p>
<h3>Yu Sulian's Prelude as a Pioneer of Reformed Peking Opera</h3>
<p>The famous</p>
<p>female performer Yu Sulian has decided to lead a group of "Reformed Peking Opera" artists in a grand performance at the Xindu Theater starting on November 1.</p>
<p>The Xindu authorities attach great importance to her. Before Yu Sulian takes the stage, tonight from 7:30 to 9:30, a "Prelude" to the full general meeting will be broadcast on the "Glass Radio Station."</p>
<p>Yu Sulian's broadcast of "Reformed Peking Opera" will once again embellish the scenery of "Xindu Night," right? In addition, the Cantonese opera rehearsals, which are rarely seen at sea, held daily by the Glass Radio Station, are also worth introducing to the ladies.</p>
