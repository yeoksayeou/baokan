<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨日分電德波義三國元首之後、總統秘書赫爾里頃向報界發表談話稱、總統心目中、並無「慕尼黑第二協定」、其致德元首希特勒電有云、「德波兩國務須尊重對方之獨立與領土完整」可以見矣、政界人士對於羅斯福總統此舉之初步印象、厥爲總統在去年九月間捷克問題緊張時、即已推行一種政策、務欲用盡一切方法以避免戰爭、此决復又呼籲和平、乃係賡續推行此項政策、並乘此機會向全國興論說明時局眞相、籍以間執孤立派之口、同時又可就德波兩國元首覆文內容如何、令其自承爲侵略者、此外、接近白宮人士並宣構、總統所指之調解員並非毛遂自薦、亦不屬意於美國政府官吏、乃所以證明美國政府對於德波兩國現行爭議、完全處於超然地位云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>柏林　美總統羅斯福致希特勒元首電、係於本日淸晨遞到此間、各報均未及刊布、主管方面亦未表示意見、但觀於柏林波森日報所用標題、「羅斯福總統又一厚顏舉動」字樣、则德國方面對於羅斯福總統來電態度如何、殆可窺見一斑、（廿五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>致波總統電</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統致波蘭總統莫錫基電、頃由官方公佈、其言略謂、「現行危機顯甚嚴重、亟須考慮一切可能的方法、用以防止大戰之爆發、鄙人爰認爲有提議若干項解決方案之理由、貴國與德國間之爭議、大可經由直接談判設法解決、此而不能、不妨將各項爭議提付仲裁、或推舉超然的調解員、此一調解員所隸屬之國必須爲一傳統的中立國、或與現行爭議截然無關之共和國、或距離窰遠而與現行各項問題無關之第三國、閣下對於上述三種方式、倘能加以接受、並據以覓致解決方案、則美國政府人民決當寄以熱烈的同情、但當事雙方在研究上述各項方式之際、務當避不採取任何敵對行動、此層鄙人業已向德國政府發出呼籲、茲願向閣下提出同樣請求、鄙人乃係代表美國發言、諒爲閣下所深知、過去已曾竭盡棉薄以保持和平、今後自當賡續努力、並深信全世界各國政府不分大小、亦莫不願望和平、反對武力侵略、近來國際間不斷發生爭議、且互相提出耍求對案、固屬實在情形、但當事雙方若果志在和平、則一切爭議均可和平解決、此層當爲各國政府所深知、茲除電達德國元首希特勒外、特此電達閣下、即希垂察、羅斯福印」、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>朂教師</h3>
<p>明天是先師孔子誕日，也是中國第一屆敎師節。把中國文化代表人物孔子的生辰定爲敎師節日，足見國民政府舉措用意的深遠，而在目前，尤有其時代的意義。至於上海，物質生活艱難，精神環境惡劣。在此現象之下的上海敎師，對於這偉大節日的到臨，正需要有一番深切的體認和縝密的檢討；所以我們在這裏願貢一言，作爲敎師們體認和檢討的參考。</p>
<p>由法令規定的敎師節，雖自本屆爲始；但實際的敎師節却始於民國二十一年。—那時全國敎師一致擬定以六月六日爲敎師節。—敎師節的宗旨，與勞動節相彷彿，就是發揮精神勞動者敎師的集體力量，共謀改善生活待遇，保障職業地位，增高專業修養等項方法。把敎師節的一般宗旨，來體認上海當前的情况，敎師們必然會發生着兩種需要：一是生活待遇的提高，一是思想行動的自我肅檢。</p>
<p>關於敎師的現實問題，不一而足。其間有爲全體敎師所感受切膚之痛，却又爲大多數敎師所不願正面表示的，無過於待遇問題；問題的嚴重性還不止所謂待遇的高低，簡直是生活能吾維持的問題。敎師生活原來是淸苦的，菲薄的收入，應付職業的儀容，在平時就已不容易保持均衡；况當此際。薪給旣因大環境的影響一再低减　而生活費用却跟着孤島社會而增加到二三倍以上，所以敎師的生活問題在目前眞是嚴重。然而我們要知道：在往昔，敎師的生活問題或許祗是一個單獨的問題，可是在目前孤島社會上，却已轉變爲一般問題中的一枝節，不是一個孤立的問題了。如果大環境一天沒有出路，敎師生活問題也就無法單獨解決。但是一般社會對於敎師向抱崇敬的態皮·當然對他們的生活也表示深切的同情，所以在可能範圍以內，各方面對於敎育者的生活，應該盡量予以方便；允其辦理敎育事業的學校或其他有關的機關，此際應該自動酌量提高敎師的待遇；即使臨時採行米貼的辦法，聊補不足，亦無不可。這雖不過治標，而事實上却是亟需的。這也不能希望每一學校皆能辦到·但至少在若干比較有辦法的學校，是應該率先想法的。</p>
<p>敎師的思想行動何以需要自我肅檢？因爲敎師的責任非常重大，而目前孤島與環境十分惡劣，爲表示精神立塲，强固精神堡壘起見，敎師們應該嚴正地厲行自身的肅檢工作。敎師的責任在把靑年和兒童訓練成爲民族國家的健全分子，同時又處於社會核心表率羣倫的地位。蔣總裁在敎育會議的訓詞裏說：「今天的敎育家，應該自認爲衝鋒折銳的前綫戰士，應該自認爲移風易俗的社會導師，應該自認爲筆路藍縷的開國先驅，應該自認爲繼絕存亡的聖賢英傑」。這可見教室在當前負有何等的責任！敎師的思想行動會發生何等重大的影響！</p>
<p>由於當前上海環境的惡劣，允需耍完成精神的無形的堡壘，敎師們實應負起領導建立的重任。檢討現實，上海敎育界裏正在流傳着若干不盡不實的謠言，揆之孔子所說「吾道一以貫之」，又說「攻乎異端，斯害也已」，我們就不英視若無　。謠言或完全無根，或確有其事，必然是少數中的少數，我們深信其他多數的教育者，一定都是一心一德，忠誠爲民族服務的。然而爲正視聽，釋羣疑，強固自身的精神堡壘，接受社會上的期許起見，敎育界此時確有思想行動自我肅檢的必要。</p>
<p>上海的敎育事業，正如其他部門一樣，暫時消失了統率領導的機關，所謂肅檢工作，不能發生統制的作用，因此最重要的還是敎師的「自律」。蔣總裁爲學記上的「師嚴道尊」四字下一個新義道：「所謂嚴師之嚴。並不是夏楚之威，鞭朴之施的末技，乃是說爲敎師者必須嚴於自律，而後師道乃尊」。這就可見自律的重要。自律是思想行動肅檢的基礎工作，但不是一個表現的方法；因此受敎育的靑年以及一般社會上的人，還希望敎師能在自律之外，更有一番嚴明的「自白」。敎師節的前後，正是學校開學，敎師們重登講席的時候，即是自白的絕好機會。由敎師的自白，不但使靑年對敎師有嚴肅的認識，同時使靑年對於抗戰時期的國族、對於國族抗戰的現階段，獲得更準確的認識</p>

<p>倫敦　下院昨夜辯論國際局勢時、擁擠而肅靜、首相張伯倫陳述德國之行爲與威脅及英國抵抗武力之決心後、反對派工黨領袖格林武·反對派自由黨領袖辛克萊·前外相艾登·著名和平派藍斯堡·與前閣員愛梅立、相繼發言、贊助政府政策、工黨格林武稱、首相之言、極關嚴重、歐洲戰雲密佈、甘爲戎首者、實負可怖責任、余敢謂、此種局勢、大都爲吾人前已指責之錯誤政策所造成、惟吾人現旣遇凄楚局勢、故余不欲此時發言、追究前非、（衆歡呼、）吾人所希望之和平陣錢、已因今晨消息而大受損害、惟英法團結依然、地位未嘗稍弱、余之主要旨趣、在說明反對派之態度、格氏曾至此、乃宣讀全國工黨大會之宣言、重申英國担保波蘭獨立之決議、並曰、余代表全國千百萬勞工發言、吾黨決不變更宣言中之隻字、吾黨將遵此宣言、旣無改變、更無游移、吾黨非擁護現政府者、但不願海外之人、誤認工黨對於任何侵略行爲、願意予以默認、世人須知、英國工黨此種反對侵略之態度、實爲不可動搖、今之問題、非爲吾黨愛戴現政府與吾之問題、但爲勞工痛惡侵略之一點、勞工確信、唯阻止或抵抗侵略、始能維持文明與國際正常關係、余所以一再聲明此義者、因欲海外之人明白、如不幸而有實施此種政策之一日、爲我仇敵者、將見吾英國人民、非散漫而不團結之人民、（衆歡呼、）吾國對於此事之團結、將極完全、而吾人將以信任與剛毅應付時艱、今雖陰霾黯淡、然余希望尙可竭力作建設性質之提議、余更希望吾人可使德國人民了解吾人爲富有理解之民族、並了解苟果有合法之陳訴、未嘗不可以人力銷釋之、而無須乎强暴、故余勸政府採行與國家榮譽不相抵觸之任何可能方法、以挽浩刧、俾免大禍發作時、發生英國應負其責之責言、最後、余尙有一言、吾人對於德國人民、絕不存絲毫敵意云、（衆歡呼、）</p>
<p>自由黨辛克萊稱、今爲集合隊伍表示團結之時期、吾人宜使侵略者明白吾人旨趣之堅決、而阻止其以戰爭爲賭博、希特勒所恃以獲取其人民擁護者、非爲道德上之公正理由、但爲宣傳及一再達到其目的之成功、希特勒對於政治上之原則與觀念、如反共協定與自決主議者、隨便取捨、其作用無非在羅致與國或在掩護其眞正意旨而欺誆其敵而已、如吾人對但澤而讓步、則不久吾人又將遇威脅、吾人且將處於背棄波蘭人民、致不爲人信任之荏弱地位矣、德蘇條的之正確價値、今雖尙示不能估定之、但其意義則爲希特勒今後所向以素取其土地上生活空間者、不爲蘇聯而爲英國、吾人今日宣以言行昭示世人、一旦吾國之必要利益、文明生活之道德上價値、與世界之和平、爲人威脅時、英國國會與人民將與法國人民聯合保障國際信義自由與公道之原則、蓋依此原則、吾人始能建立持久和平也、吾人對於德人或他國人民、並無仇恨云、</p>

<h3>蘇聯外閃政策的大轉變　由歐洲而移向遠東（譯密勒氏評論報）</h3>
<p>「一九一四年俄國欣欣地把她的身體靈魂投入歐戰之中，一九一九年蘇聯的主要利益，已由歐洲移向她自己的遠東了。自今而後，至少就蘇聯主要利益的立塲而言，歐洲在關於蘇聯方面，必常爲一種點綴品，這是似乎極近情的。」</p>
<p>上面幾句話，可以概括載見七月二十二日星期六晚郵報Saturday　Evening　Post皮斯氏Demaree　Bess所著的題曰「史丹林重視西比利亞」一文的主旨。皮斯氏曾在中國日本蘇聯充過各大報的訪員，現在充郵報的駐歐代表。他那文中說明史丹林爲何對英法商請蘇聯締結反歐洲軸心國的軍事政治同盟取冷淡態度的原因，吾人因此可知英法保守黨的寄異觀念。他們一向承認極端仇視蘇聯，直至最近，始一次又一决的飛派代表團至莫斯科，請求蘇聯和他們締結防守同盟，以抗希特勒和墨索里尼的威脅。</p>
<p>據皮斯氏的意見，英國的保守黨以及西歐民治國中的社會黨自由黨反對革新黨差不多全數漠視蘇聯大勢的根本變遷。各黨派都以爲只需輕輕一呼，便能使蘇聯回至如一九一四年所存在的歐洲列强團體。他們以爲決法蘇聯盟一旦成立，便能如第一决世界大戰一般，擊破德國發動的攻擊，他們又以爲蘇聯參加歐洲事務的程度，端賴他們定之，而非賴蘇聯自己。今日所不同的，不過要消釋央國保守黨對布爾希維克主義的憎惡罷了。</p>
<p>據皮斯氏的意見，英法若干政治家，甚至到現在，還是固執成見，這由於他們不能覺悟蘇聯今日和歐洲的關係，已和一九一四年不同，她對於什麼同盟可以加入，或不加入，並不置意。上决世界大戰開始時，俄國亞洲的屬地大半還是一片荒凉，沒有居民，俄國統治者幾專心對付歐洲的事務。俄國秉政階級於歐洲事務所知道的，比對他們自己國內的事務更詳，他們曾參與歐洲的各種陰謀。其中大半曾在法德奧匈的名都和休憇地度過長久的歲月，甚至在布爾希維克革命之後，俄國仍由會在歐洲做過政治逋逃客而和歐洲有密切關係的人物治理。俄國歐化的革命黨且曾在歐洲傳播他們的革命主義，以致危及他們在俄國本國的地位。</p>
<p>但這種局勢自從列寗逝世，托洛資基放逐後，巳經變更。史丹林是生在歐洲邊界內的喬治亞省，並不是亞洲人，但他却自以爲是亞洲人。他原籍的喬治亞人，的確是東方人民。史丹林且曾流亡在外，但不在歐洲，而在俄屬的亞洲。一九二五年史丹林接見日本某記者時，會說道：「我也是亞洲人啊。</p>
<p>史丹林握權以後，蘇聯和歐洲的關係便漸漸地變化，這在關心亞洲問題者觀之，是很有關係的。蘇聯人民被吸引回到他們自己幅員廣大的本國，一天深一天，因此他們對於歐洲的問題，便一天冷淡一天了</p>
<p>據皮斯氏的意見，一九一七年十月革命，是俄國歷史中第一歐洲時代終止的標識，到了一九三九年五月，俄國第二歐洲時代也告終止，這是可以曾任蘇聯人民外交委員長李維諾夫突然辭職爲象徵的。李氏是波蘭猶太人，一心傾向歐洲。自一九三六年起，他見往日革命中的歐洲同志，有些是槍斃了，有些是禁閉在西比利亞集中營裹，因而寒心，所以見機而退。在歐洲危機中注意聽無錢電報吿的美國人，如果知道蘇聯國內除了電力很弱，只能聽本國官立無綫電臺報告的收音機外，不能出售，定要詫異。這是可以新任人民外交委員長莫洛托夫所說的「我們的國家，完全是另一個世界一句話來表明蘇聯情况的。皮斯氏的論文很長，不能詳引，故只能就現在和中國有至耍關係的部分援引一些，貢獻給讀者。允其中國人民，更·當注意，因爲他們將來國家的存在，或將視中蘇關係最近將來的發展而定。此外對於東方事變的潮流能運用强有力而無限制的勢力的唯一國家，却是美國。</p>
<p>蘇聯決計由歐洲廻面以向東方，是由於下列的幾種因素：最重要的是蘇聯今日很像一百年前的美國，是一個潛藏富源，而未發展的大國。另成一個世界，佔地球面積的七分之一，大過歐洲全部兩倍。史丹林在他本國境內巳能指揮一萬七千萬人民從事工作，他何必再分心注意歐洲的事務呢，牠在本國大有創造事業的餘地，尤其是在他自己遠東領土的廣大空間。俄屬亞洲的土地，比歐洲全部還大些，比美國全部遝她的屬地在內也大些。十一年來，史丹·曾把蘇聯的前途擊於亞洲東方的觀念　輸於全國男婦，尤其是靑年的腦海中。這種觀念在蘇聯已由民衆堅決地接受，正和往日美國靑年接受他們的前途擊於他們自己無限的「西方」的觀念一般。</p>
<p>史丹林准許李維諾夫試騐推進他的歐洲計畫，巳閱多年，但慕尼黑的失敗，摧毀了李維諾夫在本國的勢力。希持勒破壞和張伯倫所訂的紳士條的，併吞捷克各省時，英法總揆便趕緊送請書到莫斯科，請求加入「和平大同盟」。史丹林會在去年丸月被英法故意蔑視，到了本年五月，却被她們殷切請求，這種炎凉的情態，他怎能忍受呢，所以他便向英法專使聲明，他對於是吾將和英法作什麽勾當，不甚在意，倘若他有舉動的話，除了依他自己的條件外，是不行的。英法專使聽了這話，當然大吃一驚。但是他們依然進行談判！</p>
<p>在這時間中其他方面另外發生了很有關係的發展。史丹林雖未用許多言語說明，却曾以他的行動大略表示他視蘇聯是一個廣大的「歐亞恩派亞」（Empire）它的前途首繫於亞洲。史丹林喜歡自認爲「亞洲恩派亞的建造者，「而志在重定中亞細亞和西比利亞無人居住巨幅土地的形式。他在已往十年中曾向這方面前進。據皮斯氏者之意，史丹林大的以集合他自己國境內的歐亞各種族份子而成一歐亞新種族的創造人自命。」</p>
<p>蘇聯的外交政策，至少在一點上是和美國的外交政策相同，那是視歐亞兩洲的時事潮流而定。今日美國外交政策的注意點，因為羅斯福總統的積極努力，已在轉變之中，那是由亞洲而移向歐洲。蘇聯的注意點，正和美國相反，却是「由歐洲而移向亞洲。」</p>
<p>皮斯氏說明史丹林曾設立一種「健康警戒綫，」以防歐洲，那是沿着邊界全綫廣五十公里名義上無人居住的一個區域把蘇聯和歐洲各國分隔。那在名義上算得「無人地」，其中的居民，都被運往他處，安插在新土之上，而以西比利亞居多。「那無人地」沿着芬蘭，波羅的海各國，波蘭，羅馬尼亞的邊界展開，有幾處深達二百公里，却無一處不足五十公里。區內的各城鎮，都經消減，居民移往西比利亞，在那里很多未墾的土地。區內不但全無居民，並且造了許多障碍物，埋了許多地雷，並用其他方法使它幾不能通過。這是史丹林不信任歐洲的一個表徵，允其是防備希特勒。這麽一來，可以免除蘇聯人民中那希特勒宣傳之毒，因爲邊界上數十萬男女兒童由於種族上的關係，和邊界對面的人民，平日很相接近。皮斯氏曾說道：「吾人看：歐洲的情况，難怪史丹林寬慰地和歡欣地迥向他自己的亞洲，或至少迵向在俄國邊界內的亞洲一部分。」</p>
<p>皮斯氏於是引證昔年美國旅行家蒲克華爾特氏（一八九九年遊於俄國）的話，蒲氏說俄人的特點，是有遠見，他取得廣大的土地，使日後無數代子孫得有安居之處。</p>
<p>今日統治蘇聯的一位亞洲人，也具有這種遠見。人們總說最後數代的沙皇都是非常愚拙的，然而他們在位時都曾取得廣大的土地，豐富的利源，以供今日的俄民需用，史丹林曾表明堅握亞洲俄國屬地全部的決心，並且伸入現在蘇聯邊境以外中亞細亞零星散播的土地，在那幾不費代價，又不招世界嫉忌的地方，復爲後代子孫獲得新土。</p>
<p>皮斯氏又說道：「史丹林的政權不但恢復俄國在遠東所有的土地，並且堅守俄國現在和往日界綫外的勢力範圍。我在一九二九年曾見蘇聯軍隊攻入北滿，轟擊中國城市，以期迫令中國交還中東鐵路蘇國可疑的主有權。那條鐵路蘇聯已在一九三五年放棄了，這是因爲日本突然施用極嚴重的壓力，蘇聯在倉卒之間，不及防備，所以只得放棄。但日本不能在他處續有所得，後來想以壓力加於蘇聯另一勢力範圍外蒙古時，史丹林立即宜布紅軍決計保護外蒙古，以拒攻擊，口本便知難而退，外蒙古也就此被蘇聯吸收了。</p>
<p>史丹林在人烟稀少外界幾不知其名的僻遠地方從事經營。自一九一七年布爾希維克革命之後，蘇聯不但吸收外蒙古，並且在廣五萬五千方哩與滿洲幅員相仿的新疆，固植權力，近據地質學家考察，新疆的天然利源，或比滿洲更爲重要，美國工程師里德爾裴治曾考察阿爾泰山境，據他說，有種種微象，那是一個世界天富的最大儲藏地，其中有金，鉿，鋅，銅，煤，豐富的利源。</p>
<p>皮斯氏的結論說：「史丹林曾多少公然援助中國，「他的援助，不必論其出於高尙，或出於自私，那是以帝國主義政策的根據而出此的。蘇聯要減弱他遠東的主要對敵日本，倘若能帮助中國銷耗日本，那是愈多愈佳。但無論中國日後有何結局，蘇聯對外蒙古和新疆的勢力，是不會放棄的。」</p>
<p>就歐洲而論，史丹林將進至適可而止，以保全歐洲的邊界所必要者爲限。歐洲的舉動，決不能再引誘他，致把亞洲俄國廣大的屬地和他正在中亞細亞洲邊界綫外逐步建造的「恩派亞」淪於危險之中。他比任何人更知道日本正虎視耽耽地立在東亞，守候史丹林專心參加歐戰的機會，進攻那個「恩派亞。」他今日無論在歐洲有何作爲，都是勉强出此，而爲自衛起見。假使他能目由的話，敢料他定將專心注意東方，他願在東方造成一個「歐亞恩派亞，」作爲他的紀念。</p>

<h3>英艦外駛日兵調防　滬局勢似趨鬆弛　日方預定行動暫已中止　郊外演習並未發生事故</h3>
<p>自滬西越界築路租界巡捕與偽警衝突事件發生後、日方迭召軍事會議、表示支持僞政府、聲言將採某種行動、因之形勢甚爲緊張、謠諑繁興、茲悉自歐洲局勢劇變後、租界當局、連日與日方各項交涉、巳趨好轉、滬西邊界、形勢亦轉緩和、日軍雖宣布昨今二日在西區郊外實彈演習、但上述地點、並未見特殊緊張狀態、預料日方際此時艱、不致採取若何行動、外傳日軍已在滬西增防之說、亦巳被吾認、謂係各日紗廠駐軍瓜代、又咋日英國海軍軍艦、奉命調防、陸軍亦準備一切、茲分誌各情如决、</p>
<p>英巡洋艦　突然離滬</p>
<p>上海局勢、激趨緊張、而於昨日傍晚前益甚、蓋泊英海軍浮筒之巡洋艦康惠爾號、於午後四時三十分左右、突然解纜駛出也、該艦爲泊滬最大英艦、倏然駛去後、英國「D」級新驅逐艦鄧肯號、立即駛抵外灘、其令人震驚、不亞於康惠爾號之突然離埠、</p>
<p>吳淞口外　英艦結集</p>
<p>昨夜向可靠方面探悉、英海軍現集中於吳淞外、聞該處泊有另一艘巡洋艦、其名未悉、又泊有航空母艦鷹號·驅逐艦兩艘·及砲艦四艘、康惠爾號巳與此等軍艦駛抵一起、同時、昨晨浦江中英海軍亦因長江新砲艦蜻蜓號駛到而增强、此間雖顯在緊急狀况中、唯鄧肯與蜻蜓兩艦之艦員、昨晚准許登岸、聞此間英軍當局刻亦採取軍事戒備、英軍東旭萊隊與西福資高地隊、均已裝束行裝、準備接得通知、立即他開、</p>
<p>在滬外僑　紛紛登記</p>

<p>日人態度　完全改變</p>
<p>日本受德蘇條的之嚴重打擊而改變其對英態度、上海業已見其佐證、租界邊境之日軍、昨日頗爲慇懃、且熱烈招待英兵、公共租界警務處英籍人員行經外白渡橋、受日軍致敬禮、及最然烈之問候、然自德蘇訂的後、外白渡橋日兵對經過之德國竊級人員、已不復致敬體矣</p>
<p>敬歐局突變　日取愼重</p>
<p>文大美晚報云、聞睹常稱可靠方面、日方在出雲艦上及日陸軍司令部中會議後、其程序中預定昨日（二十四日）對公共租界與法租界取某種行動、惟爲軸心炸彈所阻止、</p>

<p>日軍調防　引起謠諑</p>
<p>字林報云、昨日（二十叫日）所傳日援兵已抵西區郊外之謠諑、大的因普渡路日方各紗廠中所駐日陸戰隊調防所致、査西區日方紗廠、自一九三七年起、均有小隊日陸戰隊士兵駐守、其中多數、巳於昨日調防、接防者爲此前駐虹口日陸戰隊司令部之日兵、人數相同、此種調防行動、成爲謠傳公共租界近郊日陸戰隊增多之根據、消息靈通方面甚不信此等謠諑、按外國駐軍防區中日兵調防、事前均通知該區外國防軍之司令官、</p>
<p>偽府不願　公正調查</p>
<p>關於本月十九日極司非而路僞警槍傷工部局警務處巡長金祿克事件、「上海市府」曾向工部局提起「抗議」工部局爲根據事實、於二十二日晚送出覆文、向該「市府」提出抗議、並謂就證據論、應由僞警負責、如有爭執可作公正調査云云、乃「上海市府」昨竟復爲此事二度致函工部局、曉曉爭辯、據聞其內容除對滬西警權一點、多所述及外、對於工部局所提出之公正調査一點、竟謂不能同意云云、亦足見詞窮、據西人方面消息、工部局對於此項函件、昨尙未予考慮、亦未聞是吾將予答復之訊、</p>

<p>上海工部局總董樊克令、原定昨晨乘開灤煤礦公司開平輪赴秦皇島度假、但因開平輪臨時決定改變航行地點、樊氏未克成行、據樊表示、設局勢許可、擬改二十八日乘伊薩培利馬勒輪北上、</p>

<p>印刷問題</p>
<p>外傳發現偽券之說、中央銀行至目前截止並未發現、至於所謂印刷問題、因中央銀行委託永寗承印之券、係二號鈔票紙、在未發行之前、上海市塲上有無號碼及未蓋章之分幣券發現、但並非鈔票紙、</p>
<p>係道林紙</p>

<h3>夫婦間增進愛情的妙法</h3>
<p>唇齒如此相親，但有時牙齒會把嘴唇嚼痛的。所以夫婦問的齟齬實亦是難免的，只要有</p>
<p>一方能應用微妙的方法，那在頃刻間很容易把陰霾化爲明朗，把怨愁化爲恩愛，適才是背對</p>
<p>背的，好像中間隔有無限的鴻溝，而現在已而對面的歡笑着，甜蜜地浸沉在快樂的心窩裏，</p>
<p>這是夫婦間的常事。至於打情駡俏者，那更以打駡爲增進愛情的一法。</p>
<p>因夫婦間無意的爭閙而弄</p>
<p>假成眞者，這種愚蠢的舉動，</p>
<p>雖也有，但畢竟是少有的。任</p>
<p>何事情的小題大做或假題發揮</p>
<p>，致造成嚴重的後果者，其中</p>
<p>必有日積月累的根本原因在。</p>
<p>因此，我們對於一對男健女美</p>
<p>的恩愛夫婦，間或有些小的紛</p>
<p>爭，我們除吿訴以相互坦白地</p>
<p>眞意的表示，這是在愛的生活</p>
<p>中所必要的；但也不可過分的</p>
<p>固執。其他是我們所不重視的</p>
<p>。可是一對因爲年齡或病態的</p>
<p>關係，巳喪失了愛情的夫婦，</p>
<p>他們儘管在表面上毫無嫌隙，</p>
<p>而實際上各在風馬牛不相及，</p>
<p>有朝一日必然會發生嚴重的危</p>
<p>機！平日暗結私歡，陳倉時度</p>
<p>，一旦爲夫發覺，捉姦情殺，</p>
<p>轟動了社會；因丈夫衰弱無能</p>
<p>不甘靑春虛度，乘隙私奔，或</p>
<p>振振有詞，大興離婚之訟者，</p>
<p>這在今日社會上是多不勝計的</p>
<p>此種婚姻的糾葛，男女雙</p>
<p>方雖均有關係，但事實上總以</p>
<p>男子的原因居多。如男子於早</p>
<p>年犯有自　價遺精，或婚後的荒</p>
<p>淫縱慾，把生殖腺液消耗太多</p>
<p>，致患神經衰弱，發育不全，</p>
<p>早洩陽萎等症。則妻子的熱情</p>
<p>每無法消受，甚至時把妻子在</p>
<p>愛的生活中拋在半空中，這怎</p>
<p>能不使她內心憎恨呢？同時因</p>
<p>身心上得不到寬弛，隨致失眠</p>
<p>，衰弱，貧血，不感等症者亦</p>
<p>是常事。這豈非成爲愛情中的</p>
<p>罪人，而把自己也沉淪在苦海</p>
<p>中？然上述各症並非是不治之</p>
<p>症。只要能積極服以生殖腺素</p>
<p>製劑「生航素」，那必可收得特</p>
<p>殊之神效。因此劑於服後一日</p>
<p>夜間即能生精補腎，滋養神經</p>
<p>，助長發育，能繼續服用，必</p>
<p>可於短期內根治各症。中老年</p>
<p>人常服，更可收延年益壽返老</p>
<p>還童之效。惟有遺精者須兼服</p>
<p>「希米脫氏固精片」以制止遺洩</p>
<p>，則收效允速！</p>
<p>陳君飛鵬，閩人，年二十</p>
<p>七歲，因早年自凟荒淫過度，</p>
<p>患早洩陽萎，遺精腦弱諸症。</p>
<p>夫婦時起勃谿，痛苦非常！上</p>
<p>月就余診治，即囑其在五洲大</p>
<p>藥房購「生殖素」半打，「希米</p>
<p>脫氏固精片」兩盒，使其二者</p>
<p>兼服，遺精於三數日即愈。其</p>
<p>他各症，亦均於匝月內根治。</p>
<p>夫婦愛情因此彌篤。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯萎癟的女性莫再自誤了！</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>常此科學萬能何用憂成自傷</p>
<p>我國社會上有一句流行語呌作：</p>
<p>『家花那有野花香？』若照這句話的字</p>
<p>面上看來，似乎有些不近情理，因爲家花不一定便會比野花</p>
<p>不如。可是你如果仔細反覆想一想，便覺得大有意義了。因</p>
<p>爲「家花』是比喻妻子，他所以要說這句話，當然他的妻子有</p>
<p>種種使他不愜意的地方。換句話說，便是他的妻子有着種種</p>
<p>缺點。如照過去的社會情况说，自然是婦德，婦容，婦工等</p>
<p>方面不如人。要是照現在的維新潮流說，則尤其脫不了一個</p>
<p>『健美』。</p>
<h3>遺精腦弱切忌煩慮</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>米價貴到四十元一石，任</p>
<p>何物價均在飛漲聲中，除去少</p>
<p>數居在象牙之塔裏的資產階級</p>
<p>外，恐怕每個人都浸沉在生活</p>
<p>的憂慮中：世飯作裏的老　知</p>
<p>吿着：每客非二十餘元不辦，</p>
<p>做學生的家裹寄來少些父兄的</p>
<p>血汗之資，不够付一次的膳宿</p>
<p>費，從事工商事業者，辛苦了</p>
<p>一月所得來的工資還不够付一</p>
<p>個月飯食費，黃包車夫汗不知</p>
<p>出了多少拉了一天，所得的錢</p>
<p>還不夠　米回去養活他的妻兒</p>
<p>，「怎麽得了」！一片的呌苦聲</p>
<p>遺精是靑年人的通病，差</p>
<p>不多十之八九的靑年都有此病</p>
<p>。平時生活能稍如意，清心寡</p>
<p>慾，戒絕自潰。如能再服以特</p>
<p>效藥「希米脫氏固精片」那是很</p>
<p>容易治愈而無關緊要的。可是</p>
<p>遺精靑年切忌煩慮，因爲煩慮</p>
<p>最耗精神而傷神經，遺精因生</p>
<p>命源泉的遺失，亦最耗精神而</p>
<p>傷神經；所以煩慮不特足以促</p>
<p>進遺精症的惡化，而大有造成</p>
<p>滑精漏精的危險，亦能直接使</p>
<p>身體衰弱。而遺精靑年加之生</p>
<p>活之煩慮，猶如一弱國的內憂</p>
<p>與外侮倶來，簡直有危亡於旦</p>
<p>夕之　！</p>
<p>何以有遺精症？最多的原</p>
<p>因爲自凟縱慾。遺精初起，能</p>
<p>注意攝生，早作治療，最爲得</p>
<p>策。若因循失治，或煩慮過度</p>
<p>，待症象惡化精枯血枯之後，</p>
<p>則凡腦力衰弱，健忘失眠，腰</p>
<p>酸背痛，腎萎早洩，發育不全</p>
<p>，未老先衰等症象卽不一而足</p>
<p>。此種靑年，簡直是一殘癈者</p>
<p>，尙有何作爲？恐在夫婦生活</p>
<p>中，亦將表現其不中用，而爲</p>
<p>妻痛恨，演出家庭間之種種悲</p>
<p>劇…</p>
<p>遺精症惡化後的療法，除</p>
<p>仍須服「希米脫氏固精片」以鞏</p>
<p>固精關，制止遺洩外，更須服</p>
<p>生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以根</p>
<p>本培補共腦腎，增益其精血，</p>
<p>滋養其神經，此劑如繼續服用</p>
<p>，更可促進發育，調整新陳代</p>
<p>謝，必可於短期內恢復美滿健</p>
<p>康。能來本診所兼施電療注射</p>
<p>者，更可保證根治。</p>
<p>因爲人的天性是愛美的，</p>
<p>當此高唱乳峯美，臀部美，曲</p>
<p>線美的今日，還有誰願意娶乳</p>
<p>峯萎癟，臀部瘦削，曲線毫無</p>
<p>的醜陋女子。雖然醜陋女子從</p>
<p>簡接轉輾關係（如婚前未經覿</p>
<p>面，或婚後方始發生）也一樣</p>
<p>嫁得着男子，可是一旦被丈夫</p>
<p>發覺以後，允其在公衆宴會地</p>
<p>方，和健美女郎相形之下，她</p>
<p>的丈夫自然要感嘆着「家花那</p>
<p>有野花香」了。所以此等女性</p>
<p>，不特易被男子憎惡，幸福毫</p>
<p>無！即於自己的身心上，亦莫</p>
<p>不感受無限痛苦！欲謀補救，</p>
<p>祇有憑藉萬能之科學。據世界</p>
<p>著名婦科專家康德林及余經騐</p>
<p>，均公認以服生殖腺卵巢製劑</p>
<p>女用『生殖素』最爲對症而特效</p>
<p>。蓋乳峰萎　的主要原因，爲</p>
<p>卵巢機能受自凟束胸，月經不</p>
<p>調，白帶緾綿，營養不良，惡</p>
<p>經年等症所推殘，影响新陳</p>
<p>代謝作用所致。故此時若以雄</p>
<p>壯動物之卵巢腺素製成之女用</p>
<p>『生殖素』服之。自能百發百中</p>
<p>，立著顯效。倘繼續服用，不</p>
<p>特可使萎　的乳峯，隆然高聳</p>
<p>，同時且能使臀部豐腴，面部</p>
<p>紅潤，靑春常駐。</p>

<h3>淋濁發赤腫痛之特治法</h3>
<p>淋病在急性時，其龜頭及包皮，因淋毒的刺㦸而致發炎腫痛，爲急性時恒遇之症狀。患者之尿道口周圍部分，每必發赤腫痛，此種症象之輕重，恒與淋菌之强烈與否爲。其毒性强烈者，則尚有尿道口之下部，陰莖繫帶之兩側面，以致全部包皮，皆呈水腫而有光澤狀之腫脹，並伴有疼痛，但是此種腫脹瀦溜之漿液，與陰囊水腫相類，並非膿汁也。病狀既然已至如此地歩，其毒菌之侵襲已展至副尿道，林妥而氏腺及濾胞內，如其此等場所果被毒侵襲，則每於此等場所發生粟粒大乃至豌荳大之腫脹硬結，用觸診法即可觸知。因而尿道腔被此硬結障礙而狹小，排尿益感困難。</p>
<p>要偵察此等病情，當用新式尿道鏡作精細檢查，俾知病的真相。然後用德國濾淋平流電療法，直接向病灶透射蓋副尿道內之淋菌，絶對不能用局部手術可以扑滅，惟有濾淋電療，始可深入病灶，一方更用化學療法，及特製自家菌苗爲注射劑。如此在一星期內，則所有炎腫症象，完全消退，二星期，其尿道硬結，亦可消除，恢復原狀，此種療法，爲余十數年來之經騐結晶。</p>

<h3>一封公開的信　（下）</h3>
<p>— 黃炎培</p>
<p>諸君啊！吾國民衆素質是很好的，就是過去給那（一）紙片上的文化，（二）不以國家和民人爲目標的政治，（三）專責他人去實行的禮敎，這種昏黑的　團，壓迫住了幾百千年，經這一决抗戰，翻然大悟。紙片上文化，不是文化，大家快快去硏究平時生活，臨時戰爭的種種需要，沒有國家，還有人民麽？沒有人民，還有國家麼？沒有國家和人民，那裏還有政治生命？要救國，便得實行救國，要救民，便得實行救民，事實一步步逼上來，不容你不從實際上努力。</p>
<p>天助自助，因人事上之努力，去年湘黔滇各省俱慶豐收，（桂省一部份歉收）今年居然繼續豐收，川省去年熟到百分之九十，今年可望九十五。</p>
<p>可是我不願作過度樂觀論，抗戰的勝利，建國的成功，所必須備具的條件很多，况乎本身以外，還有其他條件。稍大意些，局面立刻會起變化，我還是抱定我舊時的主張，最後勝利把握有和沒有，祇占百分之五十和五十，就看吾輩努力怎樣。我常說，凡人自滿之心不可有，自欺之心允不可有，但自信之心不可以沒有。試以百分爲成功標的，如果努力到九十分，一得十分的機會，立便成功，而况吾國天產這樣豐美，地勢這樣優越，民衆這樣奮發而忠勤，就看吾輩努力怎樣。</p>
<p>以上都是我肺腑裏的話，對諸君傾吐一下。有一點尙欲爲諸君鄭重一言，沒有國家，民族斷無生存餘地，但看猶太民族，科學的精深，經濟力的雄厚，凡人類生存必要條件，幾於無一不具，只少了「國家」這件東西，一旦遭受打擊，便沒有地方立脚，幾個友邦，雖欲扶助，終於沒法扶助，還不算悲慘麼？諸君，友好中間，設或有人不耐環境的艱苦，想離開國家，單求人民局部的生存，甚或離開大羣，單求小已的生存，天下斷沒有這樣便宜的事，結果只有悲慘，只有懊悔！我呢，自幼受家長親長師長的敎養，與國家的植培，壯歲以來，雖曾有所努力，只覺貢獻太小，自歎生於國難，長於國難，今乃老於國難。眼看着無數同胞，爲了國難，犧牲他們的生命，其中不少親友，不少同學，有名無名，一一在我心目間，這是何等悲痛事？又眼看着後起靑年，爲了國難，爭先恐後地不恤繼續犧牲他們的生命，這又是何等悲壯事？詩云「他山之石，可以攻錯。」又云：「我心匪石，不可轉也。」取可攻之石，以增進我的見聞，鼓勵我的勇氣，取不可轉之石，以鍜鍊我的情操，旣不敢自欺以欺人，惟有勉力自助，以求天助，請大聲疾呼，以吿我一般友好，中華民國的新生命，在廣大的民衆身上。　（完）</p>

<h3>敎育專家江問漁論　大時代中的小學敎師（一）　最後勝利依靠鄉村及民衆　接近民衆賴小學敎師負責</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）敎育專家江問漁氏、頃著文論大時代中小學敎師於小學敎師所負使命之重大、及物質精神之待遇、應有合理之辦法、縷述極中肯耍、可爲全國七十萬小學敎師請命、（照敎部統計全國有七十萬二千餘現任小學敎師）實亦關心敎育建設者所樂聞、茲爰錄其原文於下、</p>
<p>抗戰已經過兩年、血的經騐吿訴我們、要取得最後勝利、只有依靠鄉村、依靠民衆、蔣委員長說得好、「取得最後勝利之道、在乎廣大的鄉村與夫强固的民心、」又說、「政治重於軍事、宣傳重於作戰、」可見鄉村與民衆、是我們抗戰必勝、建國必成的關鍵了、但如何才能够組織鄉村、發動民衆呢、這却是一個嚴重的實際問題了、</p>
<p>我是從事敎育的人、雖然總不免三句話不離本行、但我確確實實認爲只有敎育是發動民衆、組織民衆的最良好的工具、所謂「政治」「宣傳」、也都是一種敎育工具、我們知道我國百分之八十以上皆是文盲、對一字不識的民衆、講一篇深奧大道理、呌他們去抗戰建國、是不可能、這里就要用到普及敎育的工具、我國的鄉村民衆、是重感情守信用的、凡事給他們以命令、告示、法律、警察、是不適宜的、這都要用到社會敎育的工具了、但是敎育的工具、要誰去執行呢、當然大學、中學、都是敎育的塲所、不過究竟誰最接近民衆、誰最接近鄉村呢、誰最適宜去發動廣大民衆呢、我認爲只有小學敎育了、通都大邑、窮鄉僻壤、你看那一個角落裏、沒有小學校、幾年前有位鄉建工作者、曾有一篇「小學敎師敎國淪」文章發表、內容是以小學敎師爲鄉村社會之中堅、去組織農民、文可以敎書啟蒙、武可以禦匪抗敵、此文雖過於誇張、但對於小學敎師之能發動民衆、我是深深同情而認爲千眞萬確的、</p>
<p>這一次聽到及看到全國敎育會議、各方面工作報吿及提案、又會議時同人所叙述的各地方實際情形、其中關於小學敎師問題、竟有許多令人描寫不出來的心情上的憂慮或興奮、現在關於各地方涉這敎師的服務情况日待遇辦法、以及一切可讚美可太息的事實、說起來太長、姑且不去說他、我們要提出來討論的、就是在此進行抗戰同時進行建國的時期中、對於一般關係國家命脈的小學敎師、究竟應該怎樣去期待他、更應該怎樣去待遇他、這兩層不能不是比較重要而且亟待解決的問題吧、</p>

<h3>歐局杌隉不安　金價反漲爲跌</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、初因報載國外之種種消息、一般經營者均以爲尙有一綫和平之希望、且聞外滙緊軟、足以鼓勵人心、故同業心思頗形堅俏、晨開於買風籠罩下即抬高至四千二百二十元、旋聞港帮與本地帮吃胃良好、繼續飛漲至四千三百八十五元高峯、嗣因供求相敵、一度盤旋於四千三百元內外、十時半後忽聞電傳德波前綫已正式衝突、且外滙亦同時轉鬆、致乃引起賣風、傾瀉至四千二百六十元、惟午刻尙掙扎於四千三百元關邊、午後因外滙鬆動、且一般大戶多頭、因假期密邇、故爲安全計、如某銀號及金號等傾向出籠、加以缺乏買戶、晚收前一度竟暴落至四千一百二十五元、結果以四千一百三十五元收盤、較上日尙軋跌三十五元、全天交易甚閙、共的一千七八百兩、銀樓飾金先漲後跌、終則掛小五元、海關金與中英純金等、均趨下降、</p>
<p>烚赤軋小三十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因鑒報載波蘭願與德國談判之種種消息等、故乃希望戰爭之或可避免、且外滙報緊、致人心帶堅、開市即見抬高五十元、某金號進銀樓帮一十兩、價爲四千二百二十元、開後雖銀樓帮與某錢兌業尙有塞出、奈證券帮與某金號及某銀樓競相猛進、價竟又飛漲一百六十五元、金號進錢兌業三十兩、價爲四千三百八十五元、時某金號忽趁高復出、且銀樓帮續來吐塞、不久撳小一百〇五元、銀樓帮進錢兌業十兩價爲四千二百八十元、此後某銀號突代客搜購、加以賣勢轉弱、價遂重趨高昂、竟又猛抬九十五元、錢兌業互做三十兩、價爲四千三百七十五元、十時半後、聞德波前綫有衝突之傳說、再以外滙轉鬆、賣風頓起、某錢兌業力塞百餘兩、兼證券帮及散戶亦止進爲出、價又起回風、不久傾瀉一百十五元、銀樓帮賣予金號二十兩、爲四千二百六十元、將近午刻、因散戶趁低吸胃良好、又漲五十五元、銀樓帮售予金號十兩、爲四千三百十五元、作午收價、午後因外滙鬆硬、金號與銀樓帮均出籠猛撳、且進者奇缺、市勢混亂、開市便竟猛撳一百十五元、銀樓帮賣予某銀號二十兩價爲四千二百元、開後錢兌業爭先吸收、一霎時即回上六十元、錢兌業進銀樓帮四十兩、爲四千二百六十元、入後某銀號突代多方出籠、兼證券帮及金號亦先後塞出、加以缺乏買戶、傾瀉一百三十五元、某銀號賣予錢兌業二十兩、爲四千一百二十五元、後錢兌業進銀樓帮與某銀號及金號共五十兩、價均四千一百三十五元作晚收價、結果比上日軋跌三十五元、全天二百六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十元、現標金照掛牌金低六十五元、均鮮成交、</p>

<h3>美銀猛長　英印跟漲亦銳</h3>
<p>二十四日倫教電、銀市印度及投機家買進、少供給、市面平定、收盤後進者照掛牌價有納胃、但出者觀望、大條銀近期猛長一辦士、遠期暴漲一辦士〇六二五、紐的銀電、美現貨突又放長二分三七五、叉孟買銀電、印銀市况堅俏、現貨漲二羅比十二安那、期貨均長二羅比十四安那、成交單祇十五張云、</p>
<h3>英美金票所降甚微</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、英美金鎊供求勢均、頗呈穩定、英美金票、先緊後鬆、結果微軟、香港票軟弱、法郞荷蘭等票未見需要、俱呈穩定、日令票無史動、晚市仍爲一元一角六分、朝鮮票有需要、市况甚挺、晚市爲一元零二分五厘、昨日市價、英金票降二角、美金票降一角五分、香港票降六分、其他各幣俱未史動、</p>
<h3>貼現回昂　拆息掛升</h3>

<h3>證券　公債多頭出籠　市價大跌小回　外股依然暗澹</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、忽又趨疲、初有向榮之朕兆、又遭摧折、甲種五十元關復又打破、此種現象、屢見不已、自從除中籤之後、關裏關外盤旋將及兩旬、其上漲而不能立定之根本原因、由於環境多故、大戶不起、惟自歐洲不靖、有現着之危機後、公債已頗爲一般人所注意、待時而動、頗有人在、故午後一方傳聞德波已經衝突、一方又有日本求和消息、市價居然又疲而復興、前途巳有樂觀希望、昨日初由鼎康多頭出籠、市價即又遭壓迫、因其爲數甚鉅、雖有潤利長泰等買進、但又有益中永康等賣出、市價仍無法抬頭、突叉小去六七角至一元二角、午後忽有和平消息、補空紛起、突又抬高五六角、前途當有較優之轉變、成交總數共計的一百二三十萬元之譜、茲列簡明於後、</p>
<p>股票市况、華商證券交易所股價三十五元五角、成交三十股、</p>
<p>又上海衆業公所報吿云、歐洲形勢、極度緊張、本埠股市、續形暗澹、捨怡和紗廠外、一般人對於各種股票、興趣索然、該股價格、竟日盤旋於十七元二角與七角之間、收市時十七元半尙有成交、</p>
<p>倫教英商遠東各公司股票、本月二十四日（週四）掛牌行市、又見軟落、行情多屬有行無市、滙豐銀行股降半鎊、英倫註册股爲六十五鎊半、香港註冊股爲六十七鎊半、古拉客林傍橡皮股跌二先令六辦士、價爲十五先令、其餘均無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債、本月二十四日（週四）掛牌行市、上下檔各公債又告平穩不動、惟行情泰多有行無市、</p>
<h3>紗花　投機者重整旗鼓　棉紗反動陡起　雙馬地球各回六七十元</h3>
<p>連跌兩日之紗市、昨則反動陡起、目漲風劇烈、形勢又貝狂暴此種狀態、一半由二日來下跌旣迅速、而程度過厲、二十支雙馬價由七百八十五元直瀉至六百五十元、相差一百三十五元、至於歐洲風雲雖見緊張、目下尙未爆發、故外匯復縮、一般經營者重整旗鼓、在市購進、加之本日德波形勢緩和、買者興緻允濃、市價乃狂騰、但實際交易依然束手旁觀而無動靜、都係同業買來賣去之成交也、</p>
<p>現紗晨初因上日午後消息轉佳、環境改善、市塲反動復起、開價買者叢集、即跳三四十元之巨、二十支雙地球價爲五百八十二元、雙馬無人肯出、棧單價爲六百元、少頃再升二十元、外棧現貨爲六百八十五元、一跳二十元、一霎間聞香港帮現貨無交易、忽落一二十元、旋以買戶又見擁擠、漲風再起、雙馬棧單漲至頂高價收盤爲六百四十一元、現貨價爲七百二十元、査半日成交統計一千〇四十包、行情二十支雙馬漲六十八允、棧單漲六十六元、雙地球漲六十元、牧羊漲三十五元、今日有四十五件紗運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額列左、</p>
<p>同行　九一〇　內地　七五</p>
<p>香港　三五　江西　二〇</p>
<p>統計　一、〇四〇</p>
<p>查近兩日來現紗市塲之波濤洶湧、一漲一跌、範圍之巨、使人莫不談虎色變、此係一般投機商人、心神恍惚不定、在抬濫撳之故也、據某方言、現紗同業態度尙平、現紗交易亦濡滯、惟一般金子帮及證券帮、時時掀風作浪、進出額子旣大、且時刻變化、造成市塲不安也、昨日之落、今日之升、均超越常軌、駭人聽聞耳、</p>
<h3>棉銷雖未起色　棉商亦不願鬆售</h3>
<p>中外現棉交易、仍屬平淡、廠商納胃更見寥寥、僅做安達廠進匯司登二百件價一百四十六元、（鈔票送廠）、復成信進坎拿大四百件、價一百二十四元、（鈔票棧交）、其餘均無成交、價格與上日稍好三元、大概近來紗市連跌兩日、昨日又見劇烈猛漲六七十元、以致人心不定、買意减弱、其價依然緊挺、際此忽上忽下之時、購辦尙無起色之望、日廠隻包未進、蘇北來源、計到通州花三百八十八包云、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、昨日匯兌忽又轉緊、況海外棉市俱漲、折合法幣、原棉每担高漲十餘元、咋日紗價雖漲、人心對於歐洲之政局殊爲不定、况棉價又高、故交易殊爲淸淡也、然大部同業對棉價均不願放鬆也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、昨日又呈活躍之狀、投機者因歐洲政局之危急、故購買頗爲踴躍、海外棉商、亦在市猛烈購買、利物浦帮在市拖進、因之市價上漲七八磅音、昨日利物浦因政局關係、棉價猛騰十八·九辦士、印度連同預測亦猛漲四羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價回疲　下降一二元　粳秈不絕來</h3>
<p>杜粳　來源頗夥、共到河下松江及南港貨近二十號、車輪包子到蕪湖及江北新陳尖及南帮粳五千餘包、而店舖進辦淡薄、致市面淸寂、形勢回疲、貨主遂不得不甩價求晚、結果降去一二元不等、若高錫粳開三十八元半至三十八元、蘇同崑粳三十七元半、决之三十四元八角、河下早晚稻、無論松江南港各貨、悉開三十五元、原包三十七元、高陳蕪尖三十五元、新江者及嘉善嘉興川尖開高三十四元、中三十三元、新蕪尖三十三元半至三十三元、變元三十元、統計成交四千三四百包而已、</p>
<p>客秈　新陳秈紛紛趕到、蓋因滬市高翔後、各地行販莫不爭先搬運、總計運到蕪湖南京江北台州等新陳秈六七千包、大部份已經駁出轉棧、因此人心回平、貨主不復扳俏、而進戶恐防搶米、需要亦淡、市乃一致下遊、前開卅四五元之新秈、昨祇卅二三元、陳秈最高卅四元七角、惟特別江北新秈仍須卅四元四角、</p>
<p>洋米　昨日進出兩淡、西貢未開、陳宿小紋則開卅二元半、亦小去牛元、</p>
<h3>麺粉暗鬆　小麥仍昂</h3>
<p>粉市巳見暗鬆、因米價反動回跌、人心漸平、各廠以目下客銷、旣無深望對於本街零批、亦能儘量供應、不予限制、故本街店戶直接向粉廠進貨者、絡繹不絕、成交續有四五萬包、廠盤仍守原盤、零售每包六元四角七分、惟回籠貨則有回鬆至六元五角以內者、又聞蝙蝠牌洋粉亦曾開過四五千包、價祗六元五角半、市面漸趨鬆疲云、</p>
<p>小麥來源、絡繹不絕、到貨仍以京鎭蘇錫等處爲大宗、惟因市面一度回平、米價下跌、及國際情勢變動等關係、囤戶之進意怠懈、交易殊爲寥落、市面立疲角許、但後因廠需尙佳、且囤戶麵粉成本超過廠盤、故扳俏亦力、是以進價又見提升一角、統市計由福阜兩廠辦去蘇錫等麥九千包、價爲九元五角至一角、囤戶進太倉麥一車、價爲九元八角半、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆售盤鬆動</h3>
<p>雜糧市價、在百物昂貴之情形中、其漲風之尖銳、亦屬罕見、二日來因世界動態不穩、社會人心預測有利中國、致市塲中投機囤戶减少、大局得以稍安、開價亦轉下挫、計大速四平街黃豆開十四元五角、常州牛皮黃豆十二元五角、又牛皮靑豆十二元六角、崇明沙赤十一元五角、崇明沙蠶七元二角至三角半、嘉定白皮蠶豆八元七角八分、毛家市靑皮蠶豆九元、蚌埠菉豆九元七角、黃渡新苞米九元一角半、漢口六月白黃豆十二元三角、崇明靑皮蠶豆八元二角云、</p>
<p>豆子前由北沙運來三千一百包、昨又到一千二百三十五包、</p>
<p>生油前日由靑島來一千九百三十件、又一千三百二十三聽、</p>
<h3>糖市　某商在市收購　增稅之說益信　各糖跳二元許</h3>
<p>昨糖市風傳增稅之說復起、且某商忽在市購進粗白及車白共三千餘包、觀於某商之動作、增稅之說、恐非無因、後市或將因此再起漲風、亦未可知、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白漲一元九角至二元、本棧四十元九角、外棧四十元六角、轉口三十二元半、太古車白亦升一元六角至元許、西棧B嘜初爲四十四元八角、後稍回平、爲四十四元半、東棧四十四元二角至四十四元、餘照退、本綿白升二元、振記一號四十一元、一號四十元半、三號四十元、四號三十九元半、本一號計升一元、爲四十五元半、晶明冰元十七元、國糖僅開出北海自四十餘包、價爲四十八元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　水東枝到稀銷盛　——開價回好二三元——</h3>
<p>水東枝因到貨見稀、市勢復緊、昨南北市號家均有開出、高貨開至六十五元、比前回好二三元、其次照减、海南新元肉開價稍鬆、</p>
<h3>疋頭　客銷轉機　市價回振</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨市囤戶恐慌稍減、本街同業及山東幫、逢廉頗有吸納、貨價回挺、怡和十六磅雙象晨市二十元、烟台帮購辦六七十包、本街辦二三十包、旋回升至二十元〇二角五分、大鵬富貴亦回漲五角之譜、色布綫呢嗶嘰回漲三·五角不等、客銷轉機、以西南及南洋帮較暢、滇帮辦細斜·色布·色斜·條漂·綫呢·卡其布五千餘疋、粵帮辦色布·色斜·洋紗·印花嗶嘰三千餘疋、國外新加坡、小呂宋等地辦色布·色斜·漯布·粗布等貨四千餘疋、本街同業亦有活動、恒豐·同豐印花絨手貨售開每碼三角一分半、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>歐局似有挽回希望、人心轉佳、按市頗有吸收、龍頭細布首做十八元、較上日漲起二角嗣後又續升至十八元一角、其餘各牌細布·斜紋亦回漲二三角、四君子嗶嘰·直貢回漲亦勁、昨市五角四分至五角四分半、較上日最低價漲每碼二分之巨、本街及長江帮成交六百餘性、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>廿五日運烟台二十件、運天津十五件、</p>
<h3>五金　白鉛絲行情反好</h3>
<p>久無動靜之白鉛絲、市面依然不振、客勢旣無進胃、本街亦稀採辦、致市况十分冷落、交易零星、但行情因海外定價影響、反較前好起三四兀不等、刻市如一號至六號售二十五元、七號至十三號售三十元、十四號以下至細花色開價則須三十二元及三十三元左右云、</p>

<h3>時代的同感</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>趙甌北「論詩絕句」中有一首詩很新頴有味：「李杜詩篇萬口傳，至今已覺不新鮮，江山代有才人出，各領風騷數百年。」這是說到文學是有牠的時代性的。一個作家儘管他技巧驚人，有豐富的情感和秋雲似的想象，可是遇着時代一淘汰，過千百年後，還終不免落伍。他這種看法是認識了時代的價値，唯有牠才能決定作品，雖然口氣也許過激些，但眼光的鋒銳是不可埋沒的。誰說時代不能權衡文學作品的眞價値呢？文學作品反映時代，這是一句老話了，用不着我再來贅說。我們也知道，一部偉大的文學作品所以能成其偉大的，是在他能抓住時代核心，而揭發其靈魂，有他的不朽。往往即使千百年後，仍不失爲時代的預言者。結果並不受時代淘汰。我們知道，時代固然能淘汰作家，但一個好作家也能抓住時代。</p>
<p>究竟時代和作家有什麽關係呢？文學的任務是紀叙感情的，作家能博得大家的同感，也可以說是完成了他的任務。但這種同感並不是少數人的，也更不是「仰望千秋一洒淚」式的。同感，這須如泰納（A·H·Taine）所說：「博取一時代全體，一國民全體的同感，」「表現一時代全體，「國民全體的生存方法。」</p>
<p>簡單的說來，一部健全的名著，決不是給少數人看的，牠訴說出大家有的苦悶。牠是天下人的「公器」，這「公器」每人都有使用享受之權。從時間上看，牠抓住當前的現實，甚而爲未來預言。從空間上來看，牠又是溥植全世界最廣袤的植物。像司湯達描繪下的中古的騎士，郭戈爾「外套」中帝俄時代的一羣灰色爬蟲，夏芝的詩，和喬伊斯的小說，給我們訴說出愛爾蘭人微妙的意象，這些都可以說是盡了同感之能事的。他們留下時代的影子，也寫出「全體人」共有的感情。</p>
<p>一部偉大的著作必須能反映時代，這大家都知道了，但不能忽略的還須注意博取時代的同感。不僅客觀地寫下時代，以外還須給他們同情。允其是我們當前這一個時代，在奮鬥中孕育着艱苦，我們以外也還有許多同命運的人，有許多向我們含淚或援手的朋友，自然寫下這時代的悲歌，是需要的了。究竟我們怎樣博取時代的同感呢？我以爲有三點。</p>
<p>第一須傳寫出我們感情的體系。泰納說過：「人類底思想或感情之上，有一種體系，」這體系往往以「一種族一世紀一國家底人民所有的精神及心情底某種一般特質」爲其動力。不必胡亂的因襲或模倣，減沒了自己，應該坦白而又忠實地寫下你的感情來。儘管外表和形式各異，人家一樣會了解你同情你。記牢，這感情是「我們的」！五族合成的中華民族，不久光明即將抬頭的二十世紀的感情。</p>
<p>第二須有集團的才智，文學是天下人的公器，少數人決不能壟斷私有。一二人無聊的悲哀不須多費筆墨。趣味和抑鬱雖然是我們的創作的智慧，但千萬切記得：「不但有自己的聰明，也有朋友的智慧。」我們別忘記尼采的話：多多體騐羣衆的感情！</p>
<p>第三須以正義爲歸宿。時代儘管變遷，而正義終是千古不變。只要你尊崇正義，時代永遠是你的。沒有人拋棄你，除非他拋棄正義。我們總該記得羅曼羅蘭的劇本「狼」吧。劇中主人翁推理耶不就是正義的化身？誰不給他感動呢？即使千萬年後，這位不屈小撓的殉身眞理的將軍也將、永遠存在的。</p>
<p>讓朋友同情和援助我們，也讓孩子們知道我們有過一個怎樣的噩夢，我們該抓住時代，做到這起碼的三點，使我們的作品成爲「文獻紀錄」，和「有歷史價値的紀念物」。</p>
<h3>調防</h3>
<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>——京滬綫戰地追記——</p>
<p>是黃昏的時候了，船漸漸地搖進黑暗鄉，曲折的小河上，反射着灰白色的亮光；河岸兩邊滿生着高高的蘆葦，散佈出一些火藥氣味。</p>
<p>雨愈下愈有勁，衣服全都濕了，貼在肉上感覺到異樣的難過。發，祥，方，三位同志披上一件雨衣，像個小型的童軍蓬帳；我和罡，平，撑着頂破傘，但這是僅僅的躱了個頭</p>
<p>也不知是什麼時候了，好像離黃昏後又是這樣一個長長的時間，船停在一座石橋堍下，在黑暗中審視，隱的地辨出街市的輪廓。</p>
<p>「噯！船夫，這是什麽地方啦？」</p>
<p>「先生！葛隆鎮到哉！」說着把船帶了纜。</p>
<p>同志們滿以爲這下子可找個地方，暖一暖身子，烤一烤火，都興奮地跳上岸去。</p>
<p>黑暗中摸索遍了全街，沒有找到一處是有人住着的；祇有幾條找不到歸宿的野狗，拖着尾巴，在街心徜徉。</p>
<p>抱着一顆失望的心，退回船去，身上益發冷了，但誰都沒有怨言。</p>
<p>摸索吧！烤火處總在不遠啦！</p>
<p>各人都想興奮一下，暫時克服雨夜的冷意，於是：</p>
<p>「向前走，別退後，生死已到……」全船起了一片雄偉的歌聲。歌聲響徹了黑暗的天際，船夫搖得更起勁了！</p>
<p>在另一條小河上，船夫叉放了纜。跑上岸去，電筒的放射處，發現了一片牆頭，燈火向上抬去，是那麽高，那麼大，一所廟宇——南光寺。</p>
<p>主任同秘書先跑進廟去，小久一位年邁的老僧迎着我們進去。</p>
<p>一切都接洽妥當了，我們百先我到了廚房，裝滿了鍋裏的水，灶下燃起火來，各自脫下衣服，一件件烤個乾燥。</p>
<p>一小時後，一大鍋米粥，四大碟鹹菜，擺在膳堂裏，同志們團團的坐着，呷着，歡笑着。</p>
<p>主任吃完了兩碗粥，放下筷，同傍坐的方丈顯濤老和尙談了起來：「貴刹高僧幾位？」</p>
<p>「二十多些！」方丈慢吞吞的回答，看來似有莫大的心事般。</p>
<p>「是否全在寺裏？」</p>
<p>「不，一部已出去了，不在這裏。」</p>
<p>「是化緣去了不是？」大槪主任這决很麻煩了他，心裹有些過意不去，所以我着這種無關緊要的問題，來打開方丈的絨默。</p>
<p>「不，他們也上前綫去了！」方丈呷了一口茶，面孔紅紅的，光景有一點兒興奮。</p>
<p>「前綫去？」不平常的驚奇起來，重覆地問。</p>
<p>「是。」</p>
<p>「榦什麽去的呢？」主任極想要知道一個淸楚。同志們也都停止了吃喝，凝視着燈光照耀着的方丈的臉。</p>
<p>「他們去加入救護隊，上前綫去救護傷兵去了，」方丈透了一口氣，「以前我們對國家，很少出過力，這决却不能再輕易放過，所以我們佛門中，也有救護隊的祖織，聊以報國。」</p>
<p>「這倒辛苦他們了！」主任投着敬佩的眼光。</p>
<p>「那不過祇盡一點兒做人民的責任吧了！那裹比得上你們。」</p>
<p>「吃了國家的糧，應當替國家出力呀！你們却不同啦！」主任又是道副老調。</p>
<p>「我們吃的是施主的糧，難道就不應當爲施主們出力嗎？」方丈打着哈哈，玩笑似的回答，堂上哄然起了一片笑聲。</p>
<p>過份疲倦的緣故，要緊去入睡，沒有聽完他們間的談話。</p>
<h3>破壁而出</h3>
<h3>妄想</h3>
<p>— 古丁</p>
<p>誰都有一段妄想，藏在心裏的吉默拉（Chimera）呢！一隻猛獅，一頭野牛，或者一個美麗的女神，都能占住一個人的靈魂</p>
<p>誰都會做個夢吧，夢裏世界，豈不就是妄想的餘痕？一個人兩隻眼睛到底有限，從那裏去尋找一個廣漢的天地呢？個人的念頭，在風平浪靜中，固然安寗；如果觸着險惡的石礁，就有破裂之處。思想的礁石，滿佈人間，今天碰不着，明大碰不着，却不能說後天也碰不着。早上過去了，晚間也會長一個邪惡的刺。妄想，能開好花，可是也能結毒菒。</p>
<p>滋養妄想的，是人生，是人間的衆生。可是妄想，也茲養着人生。</p>
<p>假使一雙名貴的狼狗，頸上套着項圈，嘴上罩了口罩，一條皮帶，讓人牽着在跑，牠會洋洋得意。問牠：「狗，你往那兒去？「牠搖頭；牠不知道牠將往那兒去；但是牠知道往前走。</p>
<p>妄想有時也就是狗頭上的皮帶，會牽了一個人跑。問他：「人，你那兒去？」他也搖頭</p>
<p>但是妄想並不全是駕馭人的，有時也會被人駕馭。</p>
<p>譬如，地球是圓的，在三千年前，豈非荒謬絕倫的妄想？千百種哲理的發現，千百種物品的製造，在事前也不過是個妄想，至多是一塲亂夢。可是，妄想被人抓住了，利用了，便是成功之母。</p>
<p>不但抓住了，利用了，甚至於可以製造妄想。一個人妄想，兩個人妄想，不過是妄想。可是「三人同心，共利斷金。」三個人以上有了同一的目標，同一的方向，同一妄想的話，也許就能「斷金」的。可是，不論什麼事，先决要務還是得弄淸是非。要牽了妄想走，不要被妄想牽了走。因爲犬下像淸水似的液體太多了，除了清水之外，還有醉人的酒，和殺人的毒汁。</p>
<p>「人人都有他的吉默拉呢！」法國波特萊爾早就這末說過了。</p>

<h3>言菊朋唱工之探討</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>民國二十八年夏六月，曾菊朋應聘至滬，在黃金戲院登台，第一夕空城計斬馬謖，又有初决來申之坤角侯玉蘭演玉堂春，盛况空前，卑人幸預定座票，得以觀焉。越日又聆其洪羊洞，二齣皆譚派戲之赫赫有名者，菊朋何嘗未下一番苦工，今以嗓音氣力不濟之故，不惜盡棄其學而改造焉，其情可憫，其事可危，吾之不能已於育者在此；今菊朋功德圓滿而北歸矣，吾今言之，已不至妨碍其生意，並望菊朋善養精神，改弦更張，以爲捲土重來之備，則吾對同門，可吿無罪，吾亦不負吾之所學，盡責而已，豈有他哉。</p>
<p>菊朋唱工有二點非刪改不可一，「尺寸不勻，忽快忽慢空城計中之一兩國交鋒龍虎鬭，……」及城樓上之「我本是臥龍崗，……」又洪羊洞中「爲國家……」及「自那日……」皆有板唱也，所謂有板者，即「尺寸」快慢須勻之謂，除末句轉板或換人唱時，可以「漸慢」，中間各處，斷不可隨意延長也。况「我本是……」「自那日……」二闋，昭昭在人口耳，又有唱片爲證，豈能任意爲之，今菊朋唱出，忽快忽慢，絕無「尺寸」可尋，好似瘧疾，忽熱忽冷，人身痛苦，實難禁受，唱之快慢不勻，板眼不穩，亦猶是也。人之聽神經旣無愉快可言，則願出代價往購精神食糧者鮮矣。吾爲菊朋前途計，此點非改善不可，「扳慢」一法，一段唱中只能偶一爲之，若枝枝節節全任意快慢，則太過矣。（明日續完）</p>

<h3>銀星顧梅君女士談：片段的回憶（上）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>（編者介紹），顧梅君初爲智仁勇女校高材生，從影近十載，演片不下三十部；如「生龍活虎」「金鋼鑽」「鹽潮」諸劇，胥屬精彩逾恒，負名特甚之作，而皮簧戲唱做俱佳，能劇允夥，更是多才多藝，値得稱佩的唯一優點。</p>
<p>從業電影近十年，自問歲月虛度，無善可陳，簡直老是那麼庸庸碌的，談不到怎樣成就；除了感及不勝慙愧之外，更爲厄於體弱多病，未能在藝術上力圖奮進深自懷恨。</p>
<p>想起初進電影界的情形，在個人藝術生命史上，這是較最値得回憶的一幕了：本來，我就是個對於戲劇與電影的深切迷戀者，記得十六歲那年，就學智仁勇女校還沒畢業，有位鄰家姊姊，邀我同到明星公司裏去學習平劇，因爲明星演員彼時正有票房那樣的「明星歌劇社」組緞成立，只須熟友介紹，便得加入學戲的。因此，和姊妹們每晚結伴去學戲，直經一年多工夫，明星方面爲我幾决登台彩唱，謬讚成績不錯，以爲頗具演劇天才，這才邀訂長的三年，使我這個電影迷一旦如願以償，獲得了獻身銀幕的機會。</p>

<h3>好萊塢的尤物——安秀麗丹　被譽爲美國的「唔」女郎</h3>
<p>— 荻</p>
<p>繼克萊拉寶與琴哈羅之後，本年度好萊塢的銀壇上又產生一顆輝耀的尤物，美國的電影界和社會人士都熱烈地捧她，稱她爲「唔」（Olmph）女郞，她就是性感女明星安秀麗丹。</p>
<p>當然她所以能成名，也是因爲她的環境好，她原名爲Clara　L.Sheridan，今年不過廿四歲，她於一九一五年二月二十一日生於達拉斯（Dallas），受過高等敎育，喜戶外活動，後來脫離學校生活，她巧遇華爾德溫格（Walter　Wanger）——華納公司的製片家，——他曾經一手把克萊拉寶捧成好萊塢的紅星，現在他發覺安秀麗丹也有同樣的美姿媚態，所以他就開始把她捧成美國的「唔女郎」！</p>
<p>她有天賦健美的體格，豐滿的曲綫，紅棕色的長髮，半覆着一對迷人的大眼珠，走路時的姿態是動人心魄的，低而粗的口音似夢囈般地醉人，這樣的一位允物，加以名導演的訓練及薰陶，莫怪要紅得發紫，哄動全美國的一般影迷了！</p>
<p>平常她公餘之暇，時同茜莎羅米路（Cesar　Romero）好萊塢有名的倫白Rhumba舞專家，——出入於各大夜總會，雖然她個人有一對象是却利泰勒博士（Dr.Charles　Taylor）——洛山磯的疑難病專家，當然影片公司絕對不願她和他結婚的，至今誰有資格同這位熱情「唔」女郞結婚，尙是一個疑問！好萊塢的男紅星如克拉克蓋博爾，羅勃泰勒及泰隆飽華等都已落選了，所以她必定要等華納弟兄再發現一位「唔」男兒，方可稱爲才子佳人天作之合呢！</p>
<p>雖然她在銀幕上常十足賣弄風騷，表演刺激，可是她平時却溫文大方，允其是在夜總會時，總是靜默地安坐着，一對媚眼半開半閉着，上身靠在椅背上，輒易不發一言，……態度之鎭靜莊嚴，想不到她就是銀壇上的性感女郞！</p>
<p>華納公司新片WinterCarnival獻映的時候，裏面的她就大出風頭；所以這一天也可算是她被譽爲「唔」女郞的紀念日，——一九三九年三月十六日的那一天。</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Sends Separate Telegrams to the Leaders of Germany and Poland, Urging Peaceful Resolution of Disputes, Suggesting Direct Negotiations or Submission to Arbitration, The US Still Willing to Exert Every Effort to Facilitate This</h3>
<p>Washington President Roosevelt, after an hour-long meeting with Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Welles yesterday, drafted telegrams to German leader Hitler and Polish President Mościcki, proposing three solutions to the dispute between Germany and Poland: (1) direct negotiations, (2) submission to arbitration, and (3) selection of mediators to reach an agreement through mediation. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Telegram to Hitler</p>
<p>Washington The full text of President Roosevelt's telegram to German leader Hitler, which has been officially released, states: "In my previous telegram of April 14th of this year, I stated that all nations are currently threatened by great calamity, and the authorities of these nations have the power to remove the threat. If all parties do not immediately act in good faith to find a peaceful solution to current disputes, great calamity is inevitable. Although this telegram did not receive a reply, the current situation is even more urgent. I believe that maintaining world peace, which is maintaining human happiness, is far more important than any other consideration. Therefore, I do not hesitate to reiterate my appeal to Your Excellency, hoping that the current war can be averted, and the people of all nations can be spared from suffering. For this reason, I earnestly hope that Your Excellency and Polish President Mościcki can refrain from taking any hostile actions within a reasonable period and choose one of the following three methods to resolve the current dispute: (1) direct negotiations, (2) submission to fair arbitration trusted by both parties, (3) selecting a mediator from neutral European countries or American countries (countries unrelated to European affairs) or seeking to alleviate the situation. Both Germany and Poland are sovereign states. Once this method is adopted, they should continue to respect each other's independence and territorial integrity. As for the American people, they unanimously oppose the use of force for aggression and hegemony, or the assertion that any head of state or any nation has the right to take action to achieve its goals, even if it means plunging tens of millions of people into the suffering of war, leading to the suffering of all countries in the world, whether belligerent or neutral. This kind of argument is also unanimously opposed by the American people. I believe that if these goals are just and reasonable, they can be achieved through peaceful negotiations or fair arbitration. In the name of the American people, and confident that I can represent peace-loving men and women all over the world, I once again appeal to Your Excellency, hoping that you will adopt one of the above-mentioned methods to resolve the current dispute between Germany and Poland. If agreed, the United States government is still willing to do its utmost to ensure that the current disputes endangering the world can be resolved in accordance with the points mentioned in my telegram of April 14th. This need not be reiterated. Roosevelt's seal" (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington After President Roosevelt sent separate telegrams to the leaders of Germany, Poland, and Italy yesterday, Presidential Secretary Early told the press that the President has no "Munich Second Agreement" in mind. His telegram to German leader Hitler stated that "Germany and Poland must respect each other's independence and territorial integrity," which makes this clear. The initial impression of political figures regarding President Roosevelt's actions is that the President had already been pursuing a policy of using every means to avoid war during the tense situation regarding Czechoslovakia last September. This renewed appeal for peace is a continuation of this policy and an opportunity to explain the truth of the situation to national public opinion, thereby silencing the isolationists. At the same time, it can also make the leaders of Germany and Poland admit they are the aggressors, based on the content of their replies. In addition, people close to the White House also declared that the mediator referred to by the President is not self-recommended, nor does he intend for it to be a US government official, so as to prove that the US government is completely neutral regarding the current dispute between Germany and Poland. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin It is heard that Leader Hitler will send a reply to US President Roosevelt this evening. Political figures predict that President Roosevelt's telegram may not be well received in Berlin. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin President Roosevelt's telegram to Leader Hitler was delivered here this morning. The newspapers did not have time to publish it, and the authorities have not expressed their opinions. However, judging from the headline used by the Berlin Börsen-Zeitung, "Another Shameless Act by President Roosevelt," the attitude of the German side towards President Roosevelt's telegram can be seen. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Telegram to the President of Poland</p>
<p>Washington President Roosevelt's telegram to Polish President Mościcki, which has been officially released, states in brief: "The current crisis is very serious, and it is necessary to consider all possible methods to prevent the outbreak of a major war. I therefore believe that there is reason to propose several solutions. The dispute between your country and Germany can be resolved through direct negotiations. If this is not possible, you may submit various disputes to arbitration, or select a neutral mediator. The country to which this mediator belongs must be a traditional neutral country, or a republic completely unrelated to the current dispute, or a third country far away and unrelated to the current issues. If Your Excellency can accept the above three methods and use them to find a solution, the government and people of the United States will certainly extend their warm sympathy. However, while the parties concerned are studying the above-mentioned methods, they must refrain from taking any hostile actions. I have already made an appeal to the German government in this regard, and now I would like to make the same request to Your Excellency. I am speaking on behalf of the United States, which I believe Your Excellency knows well. In the past, I have done my best to maintain peace, and I will certainly continue to work hard in the future, and I firmly believe that all governments in the world, regardless of size, also desire peace and oppose military aggression. It is true that there have been constant disputes and counter-demands between countries recently, but if the parties concerned are truly committed to peace, all disputes can be resolved peacefully. This should be well known to all governments. I am sending this telegram to Your Excellency in addition to sending it to German leader Hitler. I hope you will consider it carefully. Roosevelt's seal" (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Telegrams Italian King, Jointly Seeking to Eliminate the Calamity of War, The Italian King Asks the US Ambassador to Convey His Thanks, The Telegram is Currently Being Studied by the Government</h3>
<p>Rome Italian King Emmanuel has asked US Ambassador to Italy Phillips to convey his thanks for President Roosevelt's telegram appealing for peace. According to the Italian King, the telegram is currently being considered by the Italian government. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington President Roosevelt's telegram to the Italian King has been released, stating: "The world situation is once again in a critical state, and the great responsibility of the heads of state to their own people and to all mankind is even more evident. Our two countries have a traditional relationship of understanding, and there are millions of people in both countries with the same bloodline. For this reason, for the sake of maintaining world peace, I dare to ask Your Majesty to issue an application, believing that Your Majesty and your government truly have great authority to prevent the outbreak of war. This is a belief shared by the people of our country, because if war breaks out, regardless of the final victory or defeat, all belligerent and neutral countries will inevitably suffer. All people or governments most directly affected will encounter misfortune. This is true for the governments of European countries, including Italy. If the great achievements painstakingly built over generations are destroyed, the American people and other friends of the Italian nation will certainly feel regret and sorrow. Although the bloodlines of the people of our country are diverse, they can form a unified nation. However, the populations and lands of the European nations are smaller than ours, yet they hate each other, even causing major crises. It is difficult for us to understand the reason for this. However, the desire of the European nations to maintain their independence is something they absolutely have the right to do, and we should recognize this. If this principle is publicly recognized as a sound principle, it should be extended to all nations, regardless of strength or weakness. If this can be done, the fear of aggression will no longer exist. On the contrary, if they take the lead in using the strong to bully the weak, not only will it cause war at present, but also the victorious country will continue to engage in aggression, and the defeated country will inevitably fight back in retaliation. Will the cycle of struggle ever end? History provides clear lessons. I proposed on April 14th that countries jointly seek to establish an understanding, advocating that no country's troops should attack any other independent country or invade its territory. Once this principle is accepted by all countries, it can be used as a basis for conducting talks, so as to gradually reduce the heavy burden of expanding armaments and open up avenues for international trade. Various raw materials necessary for the peaceful economic life of the nations should also be made freely available. At that time, I also stated that if this kind of peaceful talks can be realized, the United States would also be happy to participate. Now, the governments of countries other than the United States can also discuss various political and territorial issues directly related to each other in a peaceful manner. If your government can make suggestions for a peaceful solution to the current crisis, it will certainly be the focus of our country's warm sympathy. Christian doctrine seems to have been forgotten recently. It can be advocated by the Kingdom of Italy and the Federal Government of the United States. It is important to know that there are millions of lives crying out for help, and we should speak for them and prevent them from being sacrificed for no reason." (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington Well-informed sources here recently stated that President Roosevelt's telegram to the Italian King was drafted yesterday after exchanging telegrams with Undersecretary of State Welles on the USS Tuscaloosa cruiser, and was sent while the President was taking the train back to Washington. Observers said that the President telegraphed the Italian King based on the following three reasons: (1) The President sent a telegram to Leader Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini on April 14th, and Mussolini has not yet replied, so it is inconvenient to telegraph again. (2) The general feeling here is that the Italian nation is eager to maintain peace, and the King is the symbol of the Italian nation. (3) Italy's position in the Rome-Berlin Axis is quite difficult. President Roosevelt wants to enhance his prestige, so as to prepare for the country's mediation in the future. In addition, in his telegram, the President stated that all nations have the right to maintain their independence. Therefore, President Roosevelt has probably endorsed the attitude taken by Poland and other countries threatened by Germany. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>The Pope, Calls for Peace, Hopes that Reason Will Triumph Over Force, To Avoid a Great Calamity for Mankind</h3>
<p>Vatican City Last night, the Pope made a heartfelt and moving appeal for peace to the leaders and people of all nations, saying: "The danger is imminent, but there is still time to say a word. Peace will lose nothing, and war will lose everything. Today, the tension has reached its extreme, and we deeply fear that a huge war will break out. We now make the most earnest appeal to all heads of state and their people. To the former, please set aside threats and weapons, and try to resolve their current disputes by appropriate means, that is, through earnest consideration. To the latter, please encourage their governments to make peace initiatives and just progress. They must rely on the power of reason and not on the power of weapons. Why not start negotiations with mutual understanding and engage in negotiations with goodwill and respect for each other's rights? They will surely discover peaceful negotiations, which will never fail to achieve glorious success. We make this powerful plea, and the entire human race will surely support it. What they hope for is bread and freedom, not swords of murder and destruction." (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Germany Sells Out Friends, Japan Strongly Protests, Stating that It Violates the Spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact, There is Absolutely No Possibility of Reconciliation in Soviet-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo The Japanese government, in view of the fact that the German-Soviet non-aggression pact is far contrary to the spirit of the Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact, instructed Ambassador Oshima in Germany tonight to lodge a protest with the German government. The main points of the protest are as follows: "In the view of the Japanese government, your government's decision to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet government is in violation of the spirit and provisions of the previously signed Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact. Therefore, the government of this country must lodge a strong protest with your country." (Domei News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo After a cabinet meeting this afternoon, Cabinet Secretary General Ota issued a statement saying that the government will adhere to an independent policy based on morality, regardless of how the international situation changes. This goes without saying. However, in view of the new situation caused by the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, the government has decided to abandon the plan being drafted to cope with the European situation. General policies in the future will be carefully discussed based on new principles. It is reported that this plan is currently being drafted by Foreign Ministry officials. Its nature is a tentative proposal within the scope of the government's decision on June 5th and containing the opinions of the five-minister meeting on August 8th. Prime Minister Hiranuma saw the Emperor on Saturday and Sunday, officially recommended Viscount Watanabe, Minister of Justice, and Dr. Mano, former President of the Imperial University, to fill the two vacancies in the Privy Council, and reported the decisions of today's cabinet meeting. Before today's cabinet meeting, the five ministers had decided to abandon the plan to deal with the European situation. This decision was subsequently approved by the cabinet. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo The Japanese army organ "Kokumin Shimbun" reported today that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has told Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima that Japan should change its attitude towards the Soviet Union and proposed that Japan form an alliance with the Soviet Union aimed at opposing Britain. A secretary of the Italian Embassy in Tokyo visited the Foreign Ministry yesterday and informed them of Italy's pro-Soviet policy, expressing the hope that Japan should conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov hinted to Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo on the 23rd of this month that the Soviet Union intends to start negotiations on a fundamental and peaceful resolution of the "Manchukuo" border dispute. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo At a regular press conference held by the Foreign Ministry this morning, foreign reporters still focused on the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. A British reporter asked with a smile whether Japan was currently engaged in secret negotiations with the Soviet Union to conclude a non-aggression treaty. A Foreign Ministry spokesman replied that Japan did not need to conduct secret negotiations with the Soviet Union. Another reporter asked whether the statement in today's "Kokumin Shimbun" that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop told Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima that Japan should change its attitude towards the Soviet Union and proposed to Oshima to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union for the purpose of opposing Britain was true. The spokesman replied that this was only a rumor and not true. The spokesman also denied the statement in "Kokumin Shimbun" that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had hinted to Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo on August 23rd that the Soviet Union intended to negotiate a fundamental and peaceful resolution of the "Manchukuo" border dispute, saying that Togo did not meet Molotov on August 23rd. It is reported that "Kokumin Shimbun" also carried a statement that Mr. Marchi, Secretary of the Italian Embassy in Japan, visited the Foreign Ministry on August 24th, conveying Italy's attitude towards the Soviet Union and suggesting that Japan and the Soviet Union conclude a non-aggression treaty. After the spokesman denied the news in "Kokumin Shimbun," he was asked whether Japan would accept if Britain proposed to resume the Tokyo Conference. The spokesman said that there was no reason to refuse, but Japan would adhere to its already stated original position. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Count Terauchi and General Oikata Inevitably Disappointed, Originally Intended to Go to Nuremberg to Attend the National Socialist Party Congress</h3>
<p>Tokyo At a press conference held by the Japanese Foreign Ministry this morning, it was asked whether Generals Terauchi and Oikata, who were going to Germany to attend the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress, would represent Japan there, and whether Japan would be honored by their participation. A Foreign Ministry spokesman replied that Terauchi and Oikata did not represent Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Encouragement to Teachers</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the birthday of the great teacher Confucius, and also the first Teachers' Day in China. Setting the birthday of Confucius, the representative figure of Chinese culture, as Teachers' Day demonstrates the far-reaching intention of the National Government's measures, and is of particular significance in the present situation. As for Shanghai, material life is difficult and the spiritual environment is harsh. The teachers of Shanghai, under this phenomenon, need to have a deep understanding and careful review of the arrival of this great festival. Therefore, we are willing to contribute a word here as a reference for teachers' understanding and review.</p>
<p>Although Teachers' Day as stipulated by law begins this year, the actual Teachers' Day began in 1932—at that time, teachers across the country unanimously decided to set June 6 as Teachers' Day. The purpose of Teachers' Day is similar to that of Labor Day, which is to exert the collective power of teachers, who are mental laborers, to jointly seek ways to improve living standards, protect professional status, and enhance professional cultivation. To understand the general purpose of Teachers' Day in the context of the current situation in Shanghai, teachers will inevitably have two needs: one is to improve living standards, and the other is to self-examine their thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>There are many realistic problems for teachers. Among them, what is felt most painfully by all teachers, but what most teachers are unwilling to express directly, is the issue of compensation. The seriousness of the problem is not just about the level of compensation, but simply the issue of whether life can be maintained. Teachers' lives were originally difficult. A meager income to cope with the appearance required by the profession made it difficult to maintain balance even in normal times, let alone at this time. Salaries have been repeatedly reduced due to the influence of the general environment, while living expenses have increased two or three times or more following the isolated island society. Therefore, the problem of teachers' livelihood is truly serious at present. However, we must know that in the past, the problem of teachers' livelihood may have been a single problem, but in the current isolated island society, it has become a branch of a general problem, not an isolated one. If there is no way out for the general environment one day, the problem of teachers' livelihood will not be solved alone. However, the general society has always held teachers in respect and naturally expresses deep sympathy for their lives. Therefore, within the possible range, all parties should provide as much convenience as possible for the lives of educators. Schools or other related institutions that are allowed to run educational undertakings should at this time automatically consider raising teachers' salaries. Even if a rice subsidy method is temporarily adopted to make up for the shortfall, it would not be impossible. Although this is only a temporary solution, it is in fact urgently needed. This cannot be expected of every school, but at least some schools that are relatively capable should take the lead in thinking about it.</p>
<p>Why do teachers' thoughts and actions need self-examination? Because teachers have very important responsibilities, and the current isolated island environment is very bad. In order to express a spiritual stance and strengthen the spiritual fortress, teachers should strictly carry out their own self-examination work. The responsibility of teachers is to train young people and children to become healthy members of the national state, and at the same time, they are in the core position of society and serve as models for the group. President Chiang said in his instructions at the Education Conference: "Today's educators should recognize themselves as frontline soldiers who charge and break through the enemy, as social mentors who change customs and habits, as pioneers who start from scratch, and as sages and heroes who continue the extinct and preserve the survivors." This shows what kind of responsibility the classroom bears at present! What a significant impact teachers' thoughts and actions will have!</p>
<p>Due to the current bad environment in Shanghai, it is necessary to complete an invisible fortress of the spirit, and teachers should shoulder the important task of leading its establishment. Reviewing reality, there are some untrue rumors circulating in the education sector in Shanghai. Considering what Confucius said, "My way is consistent," and "Attacking heterodoxy is harmful," we cannot turn a blind eye. The rumors may be completely unfounded, or they may be true. They must be a minority among a minority. We firmly believe that the majority of other educators are all of one heart and one mind, serving the nation with loyalty. However, in order to correct the public's perception, dispel doubts, strengthen one's own spiritual fortress, and accept social expectations, it is indeed necessary for the education sector to conduct a self-examination of thoughts and actions at this time.</p>
<p>Shanghai's education undertaking, like other departments, has temporarily lost the commanding and leading agency. The so-called self-examination work cannot have a controlling effect. Therefore, the most important thing is still the "self-discipline" of teachers. President Chiang gave a new meaning to the four words "the teacher is strict and the way is respected" in the Learning Record: "The strictness of the so-called strict teacher is not the end of the art of summer punishment, whip punishment, and stick punishment, but it means that teachers must be strict with themselves, and then the way of the teacher is respected." This shows the importance of self-discipline. Self-discipline is the basic work of self-examination of thoughts and actions, but it is not a way of expression. Therefore, the educated youth and people in general society also hope that teachers can have a clear "self-confession" in addition to self-discipline. The time before and after Teachers' Day is when schools start and teachers re-enter the lecture hall, which is an excellent opportunity for self-confession. Through the teacher's self-confession, not only will the youth have a solemn understanding of the teacher, but also the youth will gain a more accurate understanding of the nation-state during the anti-Japanese war and the current stage of the nation-state's anti-Japanese war.</p>

They all stated that Poland's attitude has not changed and can be defined by the following four points: (1) The annexation of Danzig to Germany, in any form, is unacceptable to Poland. (2) Danzig must remain within the Polish customs system. (3) Poland's rights in Danzig should not be subject to control by the city authorities. (4) The Polish minority in Danzig should enjoy the same cultural rights as the Germans. Poland's allies fully understand all of this and can be relied upon by Poland, as can be seen from the statement made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons.

<h3>British Parliament Passes Emergency Powers Act, Financial Management Regulations to be Introduced, Home Secretary Hoare Offers Various Guarantees</h3>
<p>London - Both Houses of Parliament passed the Emergency Powers Act last night, granting the British government virtually dictatorial powers. The bill was passed very quickly and was approved by the King before midnight, becoming law. After listening to the Prime Minister's report on the international situation, the House of Commons showed impatience with further discussion and formally passed the bill through its first and second readings. Both Houses have now adjourned until next Thursday, but the Prime Minister has indicated that an earlier session may be possible. When introducing the bill, Home Secretary Hoare said that the Defence Act was introduced in 1914, but few members of Parliament could now recall the circumstances of that year. He was one of the few, and unfortunately, as Home Secretary, he now had to ask Parliament for powers that impinged on the freedom of the people, but in the current situation, there was no other option. The powers stipulated in this bill today were not only as important as those in 1914 but ten times as important. In 1914, military action was still slow, but now it was not. The speed of war has increased the complexity of the problems. The development of the air force in recent years has accelerated the disaster, which is the first danger facing Britain. The key to war and peace is still unclear, and this is probably the most dangerous period in international affairs. The British government can only gather its great power to deal with emergencies. For this reason, although we still hope that a catastrophe can be avoided, from today onwards, we must have the extensive powers contained in this bill, and if there are any shortcomings, our efforts may be frustrated, and the country will encounter danger. The government's requested powers are truly broad and unlimited, with some flexibility. However, he can assure the House that the government will exercise this power with moderation, patience, and common sense. In any case, this bill must become law today. Although some clauses involve economic matters, the government does not want to hinder the freedom of any people. He also assured the press that he would not censor the news until the country was actually at war. He also assured the labor community that the government did not want to deal with labor issues under the Defence Act regulations, and the government did not intend to use emergency powers to deal with peacetime events. This bill is a temporary emergency plan, and its period of validity is limited, which is a great guarantee. Hoare then stated after a brief debate that financial regulations were also necessary. Before the publication of these regulations, the government does not intend to make any announcements, because pre-announcements will give people the opportunity to speculate. In summary, the powers requested by the government are very broad and similar to the Defence Act of 1914 to 1918, but this bill does not involve the privileges of members of Parliament or restrict their privileges. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London - The House of Commons proposed the National Defence Emergency Powers Bill this afternoon, and it was immediately passed by a show of hands. The bill was then transferred to the House of Lords for discussion, where it was also approved and signed into law by King George VI. The main points of its content are five: (1) It empowers King George VI to promulgate ordinances for defence measures when necessary to maintain public safety, defend the country, engage in effective war, and maintain public food and utilities. (2) Those who violate these measures may be arrested and tried. (3) People's assets and enterprises may be requisitioned at any time, and private residences may be searched at any time. (4) It authorizes the Treasury to levy taxes to implement these measures. (5) Courts may prohibit public attendance when trying cases related to this law. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Reiterates Resolve to Guarantee Poland, Willing to Discuss All Issues if Germany Abandons Power Politics</h3>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax reiterated Britain's determination to fulfill its guarantee to Poland in a broadcast to the nation last night. He said that a conflict may now exist, so the government is trying to announce Britain's attitude not only to the world but specifically in a message to Hitler. Therefore, there can be no doubt that Britain will fulfill its obligations that it has already undertaken. "I now ask to explain the British view in very simple terms. Some time ago, I explained that the dual basic goals on which British policy is based are: one, the determination to resist force, which is extremely destructive to any concept of security; and two, the desire, shared with the world, to carry out construction work and create peace, which cannot be done until militarism is abandoned. I sincerely hope that before starting a step that cannot be reversed, the various consequences of using force will be considered, so that reason prevails." The Foreign Secretary then spoke about Poland's general attitude, saying, "We must admit that the statements made by the Polish leaders, when faced with a situation that threatens not only their independence but also the existence of their country, are indeed firm but not provocative. I firmly believe that they are always prepared to discuss points of contention with Germany, as long as there is sufficient assurance that discussions can be conducted freely, without the threat of force, and that the results of the discussions will be faithfully and permanently observed. Therefore, the problem itself should not be unsolvable. The real difficulty lies in deeper causes than this. The British people, throughout their history, have always opposed one country dominating Europe to the detriment of others. Therefore, after such shocks to all trust occurred earlier this year, we showed in word and deed that we were prepared to help countries whose independence and freedom were threatened." The Foreign Secretary then spoke of the German-Soviet treaty, saying that the British government's guarantee to Poland was not affected by this, as the guarantee did not have conditions for agreement with the Soviet Union. The British government immediately made its position clear after receiving this news. Breaking promises is not what Britain does. If German policy is willing to use negotiation methods to resolve disputes, restore trust in Europe, and no longer rely on force to resolve disputes, then England has never intended to attack Germany. All we seek is to cooperate with Germany and help solve each other's difficulties and world problems. We have already spoken of this, but to eliminate German-British misunderstandings, there must be some certainty about the future of Europe, which is why we have to resist any attempt to change the map of Europe by force." The Foreign Secretary finally spoke of the peace appeals issued by the King of Belgium, the President of the United States, and the Pope of Rome, saying, "In this time of turmoil, I am sure that the reasons for the British government's decision to take its stand will be supported by the unanimous support of our people. The British government's plan to protect international justice and maintain the freedom of world honour, which it has had to take, will surely be supported by the entire nation."

<h3>American Newspapers Comment on the International Situation: If European War Breaks Out, US Will Assist Britain and France</h3>
<p>New York - The New York Times recently commented on the signing of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, saying, "After the Soviet Union abandoned the British and French groups, the United States has become closer to the countries in the European peace front. At this moment, if the appeal for peace ultimately proves ineffective and war still breaks out, the position of the United States in spirit and substance will be completely changed. This must be understood by the people of the country. Because the democratic countries cannot rely on the Soviet Union, their expectations of the United States will naturally become more urgent, the pressure on the United States will increase, and its responsibilities will become greater. In short, the United States will be the only source of supply for Britain and France during wartime. At this critical time, it is hoped that the people of the country will pay attention to this." (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>The New York Herald Tribune declared that Hitler's regime is a regime of selfish opportunists. "Britain has no other path to follow but to adhere firmly to its own policies. Otherwise, we will completely enter a chaotic world. Every means used by Hitler to force submission has expanded the dispute far beyond any event related to the current dispute and made any kind of surrender almost impossible."

<h3>Serious Flood Situation in Tianjin: Rising Waters in All Rivers; Many Drowned</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Tianjin dispatch: The water situation here is worsening. Around 12:00 AM on the 23rd, floodwaters from all rivers reached the Japanese Concession and Nanshi (South City). Within half an hour, the water level surged three feet. On the night of the 23rd, the water depth in areas such as Asahi Street and Haiguang Temple in the Japanese Concession reached one zhang (about 10 feet). The Haiguang Temple barracks were completely submerged, with only the rooftops visible. The Zhongyuan Company building was also flooded. The Japanese military's grain reserves were completely destroyed. Military vehicles, tanks, etc., could not be moved. Anti-war Japanese civilians also took the opportunity to set fires in the Japanese Concession and the special district of Dongma Road. The Japanese Concession and Japanese businesses in the city were completely destroyed. Losses are still difficult to estimate. The water level in the British and French Concessions remained unchanged, with depths of eight or nine chi (feet) in deeper areas and three or four chi (feet) in shallower areas. The water level near Yaohua School in the British Concession was six chi (feet). The water level in the Qiangzi River was one chi (foot) above the embankment. Telephone lines in all areas were cut off. The biggest problems are coal and food. Several thousand refugees were taken in by the British at Yaohua School. It is reported that the water level will continue to rise in the next day or two. After it stops rising, it will take at least a month for the water to recede completely.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Xuzhou Suffer Miserable Defeat in Invasion of Xiao-San Road; Heavy Casualties for Japanese Troops After Fierce Battle of Four or Five Days; Japanese Vehicle Destroyed Again Between Jiawang and Liuquan</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Xuzhou Japanese army is greatly threatened by the extremely active Chinese guerrillas in Xiao and Dang counties, who destroy railways and launch surprise attacks from time to time. Several so-called mopping-up operations in the past have not yielded any benefits. On the contrary, the regular forces, self-defense forces, and various guerrilla units in the Chinese counties have become stronger in resisting the Japanese army. The Japanese army is now invading the counties again and has mobilized more than a thousand soldiers of various mechanized units, equipped with ten tanks. They set out simultaneously in three routes on the first day of this month. The counties of Xiao and Dang obtained secret reports and made proper arrangements, setting up ambushes in various key locations, waiting for the opportunity. (1) More than 50 Japanese cavalry, more than 200 infantry, two tanks, and two cannons set out from Yongcheng and invaded Li Shi, Lingtong, Sanmen'an, and Huilongji. They contacted the Xiao-Dang Chinese regular forces and engaged in fierce fighting. The Chinese army killed more than 40 Japanese soldiers and captured more than 20 horses. (2) Approximately 200 Japanese soldiers, four tanks, and four cannons set out from Xiao County and invaded Daishan, Qulipu, and Dawuji, attempting to meet up with the Japanese troops in Hou'ao. They contacted the Xiao County Chinese regular forces and a part of the Second Column and fought fiercely. The Chinese army killed more than 20 Japanese soldiers, and the Chinese also suffered some casualties. (3) More than 500 Japanese and puppet troops, four tanks, and two cannons set out from Huangkou and invaded Dongdian, Zhao Zhuangji, and Zhang Xinji, attempting to meet up with the Japanese troops in Hou'ao. They contacted the Xiao County Chinese regular forces and a part of the Second Column. The Chinese army killed more than ten Japanese soldiers and wounded more than 20 Japanese soldiers. In total, more than a thousand Japanese and puppet troops fought with the Chinese forces for four or five days. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses in daily fierce battles and fled in panic. The Japanese troops stationed in Hou'ao could not stand their ground and fled directly to the western districts of Xiao, and there was no trace of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Chinese troops near Xuzhou have been very active recently. At the beginning of the month, the Fifth Detachment of the Tongshan Regular Brigade, led by Wang Huamin, destroyed a bridge on the Jinpu Railway, causing a train to derail and killing more than a dozen Japanese soldiers and injuring three or forty passengers. Subsequently, the Third Brigade of the Chinese army continued to destroy a section of the railway between Jiawang and Liuquan, causing a coal car in Jiawang to overturn and destroying its locomotive. Subsequently, Japanese and puppet railway guards rushed to the scene and were jointly attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese army was surrounded on all sides, while the Chinese army occupied a relatively advantageous terrain. As a result of the fierce battle, the Chinese army killed 60 or 70 Japanese soldiers. The next morning, more than 200 Chinese soldiers selected 50 daredevils to attack the coal kiln in Jiawang. The Japanese and puppet troops guarding the kiln hastily fought back and were killed by more than a dozen. They captured more than 30 puppet soldiers, 42 rifles, and many other military supplies. The new kiln was completely occupied. A small number of puppet soldiers fled in panic. The Chinese army is still clearing out the Japanese and puppet troops in Jiawang.</p>
<h3>Thousands of Mu of Lakes, Chinese Army Captures Machine Gun; Two Japanese Soldiers Swim Away to Escape</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Jiaozhi Town outside Fengmen in this county, controls the waterway choke point between Wu and Kun counties. The Japanese military attaches great importance to it and often dispatches a team of soldiers to be stationed at the Baosheng Temple on South Street of the town (formerly the site of Wu County Fuli Elementary School). Recently, the Japanese army saw a large number of Chinese troops arriving in Peng and Bacheng in northern Kunshan, causing tension in Kunshan and Jiaozhi. On the 17th, the Japanese officer stationed in Jiaozhi, Yoshikazu Imamura, saw that the Chinese army had the potential to attack from the south and was very frightened. He asked the Japanese army in Chenmu for help, but the troops in Chenmu were not enough to be equipped, so only one Japanese machine gun was allocated. On the same day, two Japanese soldiers were assigned to escort the machine gun on a merchant ship traveling between Chenmu and Jiaozhi. The incident of borrowing a gun was discovered by the ×× Brigade of the Chinese army, which dispatched six unarmed soldiers, disguised as passengers, to board the cabin in advance. When the ship sailed to Wanqian Lake (seven li away from Jiaozhi), the six Chinese soldiers took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness and seized two rifles. The remaining four soldiers surrounded the Japanese army. At that time, the Japanese soldiers saw that it was difficult to fight back and jumped into the lake from the cabin to swim away to escape. The six Chinese soldiers originally intended to go into the water to pursue them, but since the purpose had been achieved, they had to let them escape. When they landed at the port, they handed over the captured machine gun and rifle to a certain place. Afterwards, the escaped Japanese soldiers reported to Imamura, who then sent a full team of 120 Japanese soldiers to search the Wanqian Lake area that night. However, because the Chinese army's traces had been erased, they found nothing. Imamura was furious and arrested six farmers, Jin Gongliang, Sun Juquan, etc., and tortured them, but to no avail.</p>
<h3>After Occupying Shenzhen, the Japanese Army Plans to Invade Huizhou Again; Plans to Occupy Huizhou to Control the Coastal Route; Chinese Army Holds Huizhou-Bolo, Fierce Battle Imminent</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese army invading Guangdong has long planned to occupy all the coastal areas of the eastern district of Guangdong Province in order to complete its coastal blockade of the hinterland. However, due to insufficient troop allocation, it has not launched yet. Recently, the Japanese army plans to reduce the consumption of its naval power, withdraw Japanese warships to develop in other directions, and is forced to urgently carry out the blockade of various coastlines in Guangdong Province to replace the monitoring tasks of the Japanese navy. A few months ago, after the Japanese army captured Chaozhou and Shantou, it also seized Shanwei last month. Later, because there was no danger to defend along the coast, it soon withdrew from Shanwei. Afterwards, because the inability to defend Shanwei was purely due to the Chinese army in Huizhou and other places being able to copy and attack at any time, after withdrawing from Shanwei, it immediately deployed a large number of troops and planned to occupy Huizhou again, and then open up the coastal route from Shantou to Haifeng and Huizhou. This is the latest strategy of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>However, to capture Huizhou, it is necessary to first remove the constraints of the Chinese army in Bao'an before being able to break out of Huizhou from the sea or through Boluo. As the plan was set, on the night of the fifteenth of the month, they suddenly invaded Bao'an, leaving Shenzhen on the Guangjiu Road. One aspect of its role is to lay the groundwork for invading Huizhou again, and the other is to exert a great threat to the New Territories and Hong Kong-Kowloon of the British colony, holding the throat of the mainland's supply of food to Hong Kong. Often, after the Japanese army failed in Zhongshan, it planned other disturbances. Japanese warships in Hengmen and other places in Zhongshan sailed to Dachan Bay in the sea off Bao'an, hovering day and night, and secretly surveying waterways. Those who knew the situation early knew that it would take action against Bao'an, but did not expect it to proceed so urgently. Therefore, there were very few defensive troops along the coast of Bao'an. Therefore, the Japanese army captured Nanto City in the shortest time. Many county residents who did not have time to escape were stabbed to death and trampled on. After the Japanese army entered the city, it only left a small number to guard the city, and most of them continued to advance towards Shenzhen. At the same time, three or four Japanese aircraft frequently flew over Shenzhen and the Luohu Station to reconnaissance and suspected that there were guerrillas nearby, opening machine guns to sweep downwards. The number of refugees who were shot and killed on the way was countless.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Suffers Losses Outside East Gate of Wuxi</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Around 6:00 AM on the 19th, at the small vegetable market near the Tingzi Bridge outside Dongdou, more than a dozen guerrillas suddenly came and fired at the Japanese army on sentry duty there. At that time, they exchanged fire with each other, and two Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. Some residents of the vegetable market were affected, including Mi Jinfu from Liyang, Liang Li from Yancheng boaters, and Wang A'er from Yangzhou. Afterwards, the puppet police bureau sent Zhu Shaoming to investigate, and the Japanese army was greatly alarmed and carried out a search, and the residents were disturbed again.</p>
<h3>Floods and Plague in Northern Anhui; Breaches of Hundreds of Zhang in Huaihe River Embankments; Plague Rampant and Spreading Rapidly</h3>
<p>Zhengyang Correspondence: The counties in northern Anhui suffered from war last year. Important cities were bombed, and the devastation was appalling. People were displaced everywhere. In addition, the Yellow River flooded, causing another major disaster, resulting in skeletal figures waiting to die, numbering in the tens of millions. Starvation was rampant everywhere, and corpses were seen on the roads. In addition, the plague spread, and the mortality rate increased daily, and the problem was extremely serious. Unexpectedly, this year, when the autumn harvest was imminent, there were continuous heavy rains, and the water levels of all rivers rose sharply. Although the embankments in various counties were rescued day and night, they were ineffective. The banks of the Pi River and the Ying River were breached by water one after another, and the lake area was completely submerged. The Huainan area was also a vast expanse of water, but the sky was still mostly rainy and strong winds were frequent. The Huaihe River embankment finally failed to be protected on the evening of July 31. In the Yejia Shulinzi area of Yingshang County, hundreds of zhang of the embankment collapsed. The sound of the water was like thunder, like ten thousand horses galloping. Good fields were instantly turned into swamps. The autumn crops that were about to be harvested were all lost, and the magnitude of the loss can be imagined. The disaster area in the north and south of the Huaihe River and along the Pi and Ying Rivers is expanding day by day. The disaster-stricken counties include Shouxian, Zhengyangguan, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Huoqiu, Yingshang, Fuyang, Taihe, and more than ten other counties. Without food and shelter, how will the people live? Thinking about the future, they can't help but shudder. In recent days, the sky is still covered with dark clouds, and there are intermittent rain and clear skies, so that the water level is still rising and not receding. Several places in Zhengyang City have been flooded. On the evening of the 15th, there was suddenly another storm and rain, and the water level increased day by day. On the 16th, it continued to rain heavily. It is expected that the magnitude of the water will break the highest record of the 20th year of the Republic of China, and the severity of the disaster will be twice as great. Moreover, the plague is rampant. Most people suffer from scabies, damp disease, malaria, stomach aches, and diarrhea. The transmission is rapid, and the danger is great. The people are in the midst of a severe disaster, and they do not have enough food to keep them warm. They have no money to buy medicine for their illnesses and die untreated. Although the Red Cross Society has provided some medicines, they are few in number and cannot meet the needs. It is reported that they have requested donations of epidemic medicines from all parties to expand relief. In order to prevent the spread of cholera, typhoid fever, and other contagious diseases, the association has hired Dr. Jia Guqing of Shoumin Hospital to widely inoculate the people with preventive injections, which began on the 16th. It is hoped that charitable people will quickly raise relief funds and medicines, etc., to distribute for relief, to save the difficult compatriots who are in dire straits.</p>

<h3>Chinese Government Authorities Adopt a Cautious Attitude, Watching the Development of the European Situation, Unwilling to Make Hasty Judgments; Rumor Has It That the New Soviet Ambassador Has Arrived in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The trend of the European situation is becoming increasingly tense. Government officials and Chinese newspapers are all concerned about the development of the European situation, but they are unanimously taking a cautious attitude and are not making criticisms. They are unwilling to make hasty judgments before continuing to develop. Since the sudden major change in international relations, the National Government has not yet clearly known what impact the new division will have on the situation in the Far East, so it has temporarily not expressed which side it will sympathize with. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese government leaders are now carefully studying the impact of the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty on Asia in order to take various necessary steps. It is generally believed that if a European war breaks out and Britain and France are drawn into the vortex, the material and financial assistance of the two countries to China will inevitably be suspended as a result. Therefore, Chinese leaders are now discussing this issue from various directions, attempting to break through this possible difficulty. It is said that many authorities in the Chinese financial community have flown to Chongqing via Hong Kong to participate in the discussion. Government officials said that no matter what, China is determined to continue the war of resistance and at the same time enhance cooperation with all countries, including the United States and the Soviet Union. (Haitong dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to unconfirmed rumors, the new Soviet ambassador to China arrived in Chongqing two days ago and held talks with Premier Kong Xiangxi of the Executive Yuan. This report has not been officially confirmed, and the name of the ambassador has not yet been announced. (Haitong dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese political figures here have been very optimistic about the overall situation in recent days. First, after the conclusion of the German-Soviet treaty, the Chinese currency suddenly rose. The reason is that there are prospects for bumper harvests in Sichuan, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces. However, British figures here are extremely depressed, because not only is the evolution of the European situation unfavorable to them, but the situation near Hong Kong has also caused anxiety for the British.

<h3>Unity of British Parties and Groups, Supporting National Policy, Passing Confidence in Chamberlain</h3>
<p>London: The House of Commons was crowded and quiet last night during the debate on the international situation. After Prime Minister Chamberlain stated Germany's actions and threats and Britain's determination to resist force, opposition Labour Party leader Greenwood, opposition Liberal Party leader Sinclair, former Foreign Secretary Eden, famous pacifist Lansbury, and former cabinet member Emery successively spoke, supporting the government's policy. Labour Party leader Greenwood said that the Prime Minister's words were extremely important. War clouds are gathering in Europe. Those who are willing to be the first to use force bear a terrible responsibility. I dare to say that this situation is mostly caused by the wrong policies that we have criticized before. However, since we are now facing a tragic situation, I do not want to speak at this time to pursue past mistakes. (Cheers) The peace front that we hoped for has been greatly damaged by this morning's news. However, the unity of Britain and France remains, and its position has not weakened. My main purpose is to explain the attitude of the opposition party. Mr. Greenwood had been here and read out the declaration of the National Labour Party Congress, reiterating the UK's resolution to guarantee Poland's independence, and said: I speak on behalf of millions of workers across the country. Our party will never change a word in the declaration. Our party will follow this declaration, with no change and no hesitation. Our party is not supporting the current government, but does not want people overseas to mistakenly believe that the Labour Party is willing to acquiesce to any act of aggression. The world must know that the British Labour Party's attitude of opposing aggression is unwavering. The issue now is not whether our party loves the current government, but the fact that labour hates aggression. Labour is convinced that only by preventing or resisting aggression can civilization and normal international relations be maintained. I have repeatedly stated this meaning because I want people overseas to understand that if there is unfortunately a day when this policy is implemented, those who are our enemies will see that our British people are not a scattered and disunited people. (Cheers) Our country's unity on this matter will be extremely complete, and we will face difficult times with confidence and fortitude. Although the clouds are dark, I hope that I can do my best to make constructive proposals. I also hope that we can make the German people understand that we are a nation with understanding and that if there are legitimate complaints, they can be resolved by human efforts without the need for violence. Therefore, I advise the government to adopt any possible methods that do not conflict with national honor to save the disaster and avoid the occurrence of accusations that Britain should be held responsible when a great disaster occurs. Finally, I have one more thing to say: We have absolutely no hostility towards the German people. (Cheers)</p>
<p>Liberal Party leader Sinclair said, now is the time to assemble the troops to show unity. We should make the aggressors understand the firmness of our purpose and prevent them from gambling with war. What Hitler relies on to win the support of his people is not a morally just reason, but propaganda and repeated success in achieving his goals. Hitler takes and discards political principles and concepts at will, such as the Anti-Comintern Pact and the principle of self-determination, and its role is nothing more than to recruit countries or to cover up its true intentions and deceive its enemies. If we compromise on Danzig, we will soon face threats again, and we will be in a weak position where we betray the Polish people and are not trusted. The correct value of the German-Soviet treaty cannot be estimated now, but its meaning is that those who have always taken the living space on its land will no longer be the Soviet Union but Britain. We declare in words and deeds today that once our country's necessary interests, the moral values of civilized life, and world peace are threatened, the British Parliament and the people will unite with the French people to safeguard the principles of international faith, freedom, and justice. It is on this principle that we can build lasting peace. We have no hatred for the German people or the people of other countries.</p>
<p>Pacifist Lansbury rose to speak, saying that I represent only a very small number of people in the country. South African politician General Smuts recently said that a European war will eliminate the old order of civilization. This statement expresses the futility of war to the extreme. Pacifists cannot make a more obvious argument than this. I believe the Prime Minister has done his best to preserve peace. (Cheers)</p>
<p>Independent Labour Party leader Maxton expressed dissenting views, stating that the Independent Labour Party does not approve of war. Independent Labour Party Member of Parliament McGovern said that he did not feel alarmed by the German-Soviet treaty because he believed Britain should know who its friends and enemies are. Last year, he published the opinion that the only country in the world that needs war is the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Eden said that there is only one person who hates war, Maxton, but past experience has shown that the more we give in, the more extravagant the other party's demands. The serious danger of the current situation is similar to what Britain has encountered in history before. However, the most serious danger of war lies in what the German people call it, no matter what the German government does to Poland, it will not lead to a war with Britain and France. The German government's signing of a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union was a huge miscalculation. It thought this could make Britain cancel its promises to Poland. You must know that this is absolutely impossible. The greater the difficulty, the firmer Britain's determination to fulfill its promises. Judging from history, past events can be bad, but it is strange that German leaders know very little about history.</p>
<p>Former Cabinet member, Conservative Party's Emery, said that what must be noted now is that Britain will encounter a war scene within a few days or weeks, so if Britain does not adopt various plans necessary for wartime at this time, it is simply in vain. The Prime Minister should organize a wartime cabinet with people who can cope with the current crisis.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, we are not yet in a war situation, and we may be able to avoid war, but what we want to do is to show the world that at this critical moment, the people of our country share the same purpose and are united. I have a heavier responsibility at this time. Now I ask the House to end the debate and carry out the work that the five hundred people here want to do. So the Prime Minister's motion was passed by a majority of the House. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<h3>The United States is Concerned About the Far East, and the Entire Fleet is Stationed in the Pacific to Monitor Japan's Future Actions</h3>
<p>(Washington) Although a European war is approaching, the United States fleet is determined to station the entire fleet in the Pacific. This proves that the area of greatest concern to the United States is still the Far East. Government officials all believe that after the outbreak of a European war, there is a risk of a shift to tension in US-Japan relations in the Far East. After all, during the European War, Japan used the disputes in the European situation to reap the benefits of the fisherman. Therefore, it is now decided that after the outbreak of a European war, Japan may go further to harm the interests of third countries, and even harm the interests of the United States. According to observations by Far East experts here, after the outbreak of a European war, Japan may advance and occupy the Dutch East Indies. According to McNutt, former High Commissioner to the Philippines and current Federal Security Administrator, the balance of power in the Far East has been completely changed after the conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Treaty, and Japan's position has become increasingly precarious. Therefore, McNutt advocated that the United States should maintain its position in the Far East. (Associated Press dispatch of the 25th)</p>

<h3>Release of Japanese Military Officers Creates an Atmosphere of Peace</h3>
<p>Beijing - According to well-informed Chinese sources, Yamada, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Central China, issued a "Peace Proclamation" in Shanghai yesterday. Senior Chinese and Japanese figures here are also talking about peace. However, this was not caused by the European situation, but it has been accelerated by it. The junior officers' group in the Japanese army, which is widely regarded as extremist, is gradually losing some influence over the senior officers. According to another source close to the "Provisional Government," it is believed that the senior Japanese military personnel are now willing to "lower their price to negotiate peace."

<h3>A Major Shift in Soviet Foreign Policy: From Europe to the Far East (Translated from the "Millard's Review")</h3>
<p>"In 1914 Russia cheerfully threw her body and soul into the European War; in 1919 the main interests of the Soviet Union had already shifted from Europe to her own Far East. From now on, at least from the standpoint of the Soviet Union's main interests, Europe will always be a mere decoration in relation to the Soviet Union. This seems very reasonable."</p>
<p>The above sentences can summarize the main idea of an article titled "Stalin Values Siberia" by Demaree Bess, published in the Saturday Evening Post on July 22nd. Mr. Bess has worked as a correspondent for major newspapers in China, Japan, and the Soviet Union, and is now the European representative of the Post. In his article, he explains why Stalin has taken a cold attitude towards the British and French requests for the Soviet Union to form a military and political alliance against the European Axis powers. From this, we can understand the peculiar ideas of the British and French Conservative parties. They have always admitted to extreme hostility towards the Soviet Union, but recently, they have repeatedly sent delegations to Moscow to request the Soviet Union to form a defensive alliance with them to resist the threats of Hitler and Mussolini.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Bess, the British Conservative Party and the Social Democrats and Liberals in Western European democracies have almost completely ignored the fundamental changes in the Soviet Union's general trend. All parties believe that with just a simple call, they can make the Soviet Union return to the group of European powers as it existed in 1914. They believe that once the Franco-Soviet alliance is established, it can defeat the German-launched attack like the First World War. They also believe that the extent to which the Soviet Union participates in European affairs depends on their decisions, not on the Soviet Union itself. The only difference today is that the British Conservative Party's hatred of Bolshevism must be dispelled.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Bess, some British and French politicians still hold firm to their prejudices, because they cannot realize that the Soviet Union's relationship with Europe today is different from what it was in 1914. She does not care about which alliances she can join or not join. At the beginning of the First World War, most of Russia's Asian territories were still barren and uninhabited. Russian rulers were almost entirely focused on European affairs. The Russian ruling class knew more about European affairs than about their own domestic affairs. They had participated in various European conspiracies. Most of them had spent long years in the famous cities and resorts of France, Germany, Austria-Hungary. Even after the Bolshevik Revolution, Russia was still governed by people who had been political fugitives in Europe and had close ties with Europe. The Europeanized revolutionary parties in Russia even spread their revolutionary doctrines in Europe, which endangered their position in Russia itself.</p>
<p>However, this situation has changed since Lenin's death and Trotsky's exile. Stalin was born in Georgia, a province within the borders of Europe, but he did not consider himself a European; rather he considered himself an Asian. His native Georgians are indeed Eastern people. Stalin had also been exiled, but not in Europe, but in Russian Asia. When Stalin met a Japanese reporter in 1925, he said, "I am also an Asian."</p>
<p>After Stalin took power, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Europe gradually changed. This is very important for those who are concerned about Asian issues. The Soviet people were drawn back to their own vast country, deeper and deeper every day, and therefore they became more and more indifferent to European issues.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Bess, the October Revolution in 1917 was a sign of the end of the first European era in Russian history. By May 1939, the second European era in Russia also came to an end. This can be symbolized by the sudden resignation of Litvinov, who had served as the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Li was a Polish Jew who was wholeheartedly inclined towards Europe. Since 1936, he had been heartbroken to see some of his former European comrades in the revolution being executed or imprisoned in Siberian concentration camps, so he withdrew at the right time. Americans who pay attention to wireless telegraph reports during the European crisis would be surprised to know that in the Soviet Union, except for radios that can only listen to reports from domestic official radio stations due to weak electricity, they cannot be sold. This can be explained by the new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov's statement: "Our country is completely another world." Mr. Bess's article is very long and cannot be quoted in detail, so I can only quote some parts that are closely related to China and contribute them to the readers. Chinese people should pay more attention, because the future existence of their country may depend on the future development of Sino-Soviet relations. In addition, the only country that can exert a powerful and unrestricted force on the trend of Eastern events is the United States.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's decision to turn away from Europe and face eastward is due to the following factors: The most important is that the Soviet Union today is very similar to the United States a hundred years ago. It is a large country with latent resources that have not yet been developed. Another world, accounting for one-seventh of the earth's surface, is twice as large as the whole of Europe. Stalin can already command 170 million people to work within his own country. Why should he bother to pay attention to European affairs? He has plenty of room for creative undertakings in his own country, especially in the vast space of his own Far Eastern territory. The land of Russian Asia is larger than the whole of Europe, and larger than the whole of the United States including her territories. For eleven years, Stalin has been instilling the idea that the future of the Soviet Union lies in the east of Asia into the minds of the people of the whole country, especially the young people. This idea has been firmly accepted by the Soviet people, just as the American youth of the past accepted the idea that their future lay in their own boundless "West."</p>
<p>Stalin allowed Litvinov to try to promote his European plan for many years, but the failure of Munich destroyed Litvinov's power in his own country. When Hitler broke the gentleman's agreement with Chamberlain and annexed the Czech provinces, the British and French prime ministers hurried to send a request to Moscow, asking to join the "Great Alliance for Peace." Stalin had been deliberately despised by Britain and France in September last year, but in May this year, he was earnestly requested by them. How could he endure this cold and hot attitude? So he declared to the British and French special envoys that he did not care what he would do with Britain and France. If he had any actions, he would only do so on his own terms. The British and French special envoys were certainly shocked to hear this. But they still continued negotiations!</p>
<p>During this time, other very important developments occurred. Although Stalin did not use many words to explain it, he had roughly indicated with his actions that he regarded the Soviet Union as a vast "Eurasian Empire" whose future was primarily tied to Asia. Stalin liked to consider himself the "builder of the Asian Empire" and aimed to redefine the form of the uninhabited vast lands of Central Asia and Siberia. He had been moving in this direction for the past decade. According to Mr. Bess, Stalin's ambition was to be the creator of a new Eurasian race by gathering the various European and Asian racial elements within his own country.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's foreign policy, at least in one respect, is the same as that of the United States, that is, it is determined by the trends of events in Europe and Asia. Today, the focus of American foreign policy is changing, because of President Roosevelt's active efforts, from Asia to Europe. The Soviet Union's focus is the opposite of the United States, but it is "shifting from Europe to Asia."</p>
<p>Mr. Bess explained that Stalin had established a kind of "health cordon" to prevent Europe, which was a nominally uninhabited area fifty kilometers wide along the entire border, separating the Soviet Union from the European countries. That is nominally considered "no-man's-land," and the residents there were transported elsewhere and resettled in new lands, mostly in Siberia. "That no-man's-land" extends along the borders of Finland, the Baltic countries, Poland, and Romania, and is in some places as deep as two hundred kilometers, but nowhere less than fifty kilometers. The towns and cities within the area have been reduced in size, and the residents have been moved to Siberia, where there is a lot of uncultivated land. Not only are there no residents in the area, but also many obstacles have been built, many landmines have been buried, and other methods have been used to make it almost impossible to pass through. This is a sign of Stalin's distrust of Europe, especially of Hitler. In this way, the Soviet people can be spared the poison of Hitler's propaganda, because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children on the border are very close to the people on the opposite side of the border due to ethnic relations. Mr. Bess said, "We see that in the European situation, it is no wonder that Stalin turned back to his own Asia with comfort and joy, or at least to the Asian part within the Russian border."</p>
<p>Mr. Bess then quoted the words of the American traveler Mr. Booker T. Washington (who traveled in Russia in 1899). Mr. Washington said that the characteristic of the Russians is that they have foresight. He acquired vast lands so that countless generations of descendants could have a place to live.</p>
<p>Today, an Asian man who rules the Soviet Union also has this kind of foresight. People always say that the last few generations of Tsars were very foolish, but they had acquired vast lands and abundant resources during their reign for the use of the Russian people today. Stalin has expressed his determination to firmly grasp all of the Asian Russian territories and extend into the land sparsely scattered in Central Asia outside the current Soviet border. He will acquire new land for future generations in a place that costs almost nothing and does not provoke world jealousy.</p>
<p>Mr. Bess added, "Stalin's regime has not only restored all of Russia's land in the Far East, but also firmly maintained Russia's sphere of influence inside and outside the Russian lines of control. In 1929, I saw the Soviet army invade northern Manchuria and bombard Chinese cities in order to force China to return the dubious ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union abandoned that railway in 1935, because Japan suddenly exerted extremely severe pressure, and the Soviet Union could not prepare in a hurry, so it had to give up. But Japan could not gain anything else elsewhere. Later, when it wanted to put pressure on Outer Mongolia, another sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, Stalin immediately announced that the Red Army was determined to protect Outer Mongolia and reject the attack, and Japan knew that it was difficult and retreated. Outer Mongolia was also absorbed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Stalin is engaged in business in remote places with sparse population and almost unknown to the outside world. Since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the Soviet Union has not only absorbed Outer Mongolia, but also firmly established its power in Xinjiang, a new territory with an area of 550,000 square miles, similar in size to Manchuria. According to recent geological surveys, Xinjiang's natural resources may be more important than those of Manchuria. American engineer Riddle Paige, who has surveyed the Altai Mountains, said that there are various signs that it is one of the world's largest reserves of natural resources, including gold, tin, zinc, copper, and abundant coal.</p>
<p>Mr. Bess concluded, "Stalin has somewhat openly assisted China." Whether his assistance is based on nobility or selfishness, it is based on the policy of imperialism. The Soviet Union wants to weaken its main enemy in the Far East, Japan. If it can help China consume Japan, the more the better. But no matter what the outcome of China in the future, the Soviet Union will not abandon its influence on Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang."</p>
<p>As far as Europe is concerned, Stalin will advance only to the extent necessary to preserve the European border. The actions of Europe can no longer entice him to endanger the vast territories of Russian Asia and the "Empire" that he is gradually building outside the border of Central Asia. He knows better than anyone else that Japan is standing in East Asia, staring at the opportunity for Stalin to concentrate on participating in the European war and attack that "Empire." Whatever he is doing in Europe today is reluctantly out of self-defense. If he were free, it is expected that he would focus on the East, and he would like to create a "Eurasian Empire" in the East as his memorial.</p>

<h3>British Warships Sail Out, Japanese Troops are Redeployed: The Situation in Shanghai Seems to be Easing: The Japanese Side's Planned Actions Have Been Temporarily Suspended: No Accidents Occurred During Suburban Exercises</h3>
<p>Since the conflict between the Shanghai Municipal Council police and the puppet police over the extraterritorial road construction in western Shanghai, the Japanese side has repeatedly held military meetings, expressing support for the puppet government and claiming that it would take certain actions. As a result, the situation has become very tense and rumors have spread. Now it is learned that since the drastic changes in the European situation, the authorities of the concessions have had various negotiations with the Japanese side for several days, and the situation has improved. The situation on the western Shanghai border has also eased. Although the Japanese army announced that it would conduct live-fire exercises in the western district suburbs for two days, today and tomorrow, no special tension was seen in the above-mentioned locations. It is expected that the Japanese side will not take any action at this difficult time. The rumor that the Japanese army has increased its defenses in western Shanghai has also been denied by us, saying that it is just a rotation of the garrison troops in the Japanese cotton mills. Also, yesterday, British naval warships were ordered to redeploy, and the army has also prepared everything. The details of each situation are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>British Cruiser Suddenly Leaves Shanghai</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai has become increasingly tense, and it was even worse before yesterday evening, because the cruiser HMS Cornwell, which was berthed at the British naval pontoon, suddenly cast off its moorings and sailed out at about 4:30 pm. The ship was the largest British warship berthed in Shanghai. After it suddenly sailed away, the new British "D" class destroyer HMS Duncan immediately sailed to the Bund, which was no less shocking than the sudden departure of HMS Cornwell.</p>
<p>British Warships Gather Outside Wusongkou</p>
<p>It was learned from reliable sources last night that the British Navy is now concentrated outside Wusongkou. It is reported that another cruiser is berthed there, the name of which is unknown, as well as the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, two destroyers, and four gunboats. HMS Cornwell has sailed together with these warships. At the same time, the British Navy in the Huangpu River was also strengthened yesterday morning due to the arrival of the new Yangtze River gunboat HMS Dragonfly. Although this area is obviously in an emergency, the crew members of the HMS Duncan and HMS Dragonfly were allowed to go ashore last night. It is heard that the British military authorities here are also taking military precautions. The British East Surrey Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment have both packed their bags and are ready to move out immediately upon receiving notification.</p>
<p>Foreign Nationals in Shanghai Register One After Another</p>
<p>Foreign nationals in Shanghai are applying to their respective consulates for registration, so that they can receive notification when a decision is made to evacuate. Among the applicants, there are many foreign nationals who have come to Shanghai for sightseeing. There are many people who have returned their tickets to Hong Kong and Europe at travel agencies and shipping companies, because these travelers are now staying in Shanghai and anxiously watching the tense situation in Europe.</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Japanese Has Completely Changed</p>
<p>Japan has changed its attitude towards Britain due to the serious blow of the German-Soviet treaty. This has been seen in Shanghai as evidence. The Japanese army on the border of the concession was very courteous yesterday and warmly received British soldiers. British personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Force were saluted and warmly greeted by the Japanese army when passing through the Garden Bridge. However, since the signing of the German-Soviet treaty, the Japanese soldiers on the Garden Bridge have no longer saluted German officials passing by.</p>
<p>Japan Takes a Cautious Approach Due to Sudden Changes in the European Situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that, according to reliable sources, after meetings on the Izumo warship and in the Japanese Army Headquarters, the Japanese side's planned actions against the International Settlement and the French Concession yesterday (the 24th) were prevented by Axis bombs.</p>
<p>Japanese Army to Conduct Exercises for Two Days, Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Japanese Army notified relevant parties that the Japanese troops in Shanghai are scheduled to conduct live-fire exercises in the area west of Zhongshan Road and Daxia University from 5:00 am to evening on August 25th and 26th. The Shanghai Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported in French on August 25th that, according to a report from the Japanese propaganda agency in Shanghai yesterday, the Japanese defense forces in Shanghai will conduct live-fire shooting exercises from 5:00 am to late evening today and tomorrow. It is heard that the location of the exercises is in western Shanghai, from Zhongshan Road in the east to the vicinity of Daxia University in the south, that is, within one kilometer west of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and between the Suzhou Creek. All those who go for a walk in western Shanghai must not enter the above-mentioned locations to avoid danger. However, the Hongqiao Road area is completely outside the scope of the exercises.</p>
<p>Redeployment of Japanese Troops Arouses Rumors</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the rumors that Japanese reinforcements had arrived in the suburbs of the western district yesterday (the 24th) were mainly due to the redeployment of the Japanese marines stationed in the Japanese cotton mills on Putuo Road. Since 1937, Japanese cotton mills in the western district have had small detachments of Japanese marines stationed there. Most of them were redeployed yesterday, and the replacements were Japanese soldiers from the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters in Hongkou. The number of people is the same. This redeployment action has become the basis for rumors that the number of Japanese marines in the vicinity of the International Settlement has increased. Well-informed sources do not believe in these rumors. According to regulations, the redeployment of Japanese troops in foreign defense areas must be notified to the commander of the foreign defense forces in the area in advance.</p>
<p>Puppet Government Unwilling to Conduct an Impartial Investigation</p>
<p>Regarding the incident on the 19th of this month in which Jin Luke, a patrolman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Force, was shot by a puppet police officer on Jessfield Road, the "Shanghai Municipal Government" lodged a "protest" with the Shanghai Municipal Council. Based on the facts, the Shanghai Municipal Council sent a reply on the evening of the 22nd, lodging a protest with the "Municipal Government," and said that according to the evidence, the puppet police should be responsible. If there is a dispute, an impartial investigation can be conducted. However, the "Shanghai Municipal Government" surprisingly sent a second letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday to argue about this matter. It is heard that the content, in addition to the points related to police powers in western Shanghai, mostly mentioned that the "Shanghai Municipal Government" could not agree to the point of an impartial investigation proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Council. This also shows that it is at its wit's end. According to Western sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet considered this letter yesterday, and it has not been heard whether it will reply.</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden Reschedules His Trip to the North</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was originally scheduled to take the Kailuan Mining Company's Kaiping ship to Qinhuangdao for vacation yesterday morning, but Mr. Fessenden could not go because the Kaiping ship temporarily decided to change its destination. According to Mr. Fessenden, if the situation permits, he plans to take the Isabelli Muller ship north on the 28th.</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Students Pass Through the Concession</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that twenty trucks of Japanese naval officer candidates drove through the International Settlement and the French Concession between 7:00 and 8:00 this morning (the 25th) for a sightseeing tour. They were escorted by the police departments of the two concessions respectively and no accidents occurred, but rumors were aroused again. According to reports, these candidates are from two Japanese training ships currently berthed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>British Hong Kong Currency Fell Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the news of the German-Soviet treaty and the German-Polish issue spread to Shanghai, the financial situation in China has obviously moved in a favorable direction. In addition to the increasingly stable financial situation and the soaring public bonds, the gold pounds and gold notes of European and American countries that are likely to be at war have all been repeatedly depreciated. According to a report from the Da Guang Agency reporter to the money exchange industry, it was reported by telegram from Hong Kong this morning (yesterday) that the situation was extremely tense and the hope for peace in Europe was very slim. As a result, these currencies depreciated again. Hong Kong dollars were only about 3.70 yuan, down about 0.20 yuan; British gold pounds were only 63 yuan, down about 1.50 yuan; and Citibank gold notes were only 14.40 yuan, down about 1 yuan. Other currencies, such as German, Japanese, and French banknotes and pounds, also depreciated by varying amounts.</p>
<h3>Overseas Mail Charges Doubled, Calculated According to Gold Francs; Domestic Postage Remains the Same</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration received a telegram from the Kunming Postal Administration in mid-August, briefly stating that the charges for various mail packages sent overseas would be doubled from September 1st of this year. According to a report from the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter to the Postal Administration yesterday, the Kunming Postal Administration officially sent a telegram yesterday, explaining in detail. It is reported that all ordinary charges and other special charges for various mail and packages sent to the countries of the Universal Postal Union of the third zone (European and American countries) must be increased by one time to compensate. As for the various charges that should be collected for the fourth zone (Japan, Korea, Taiwan, etc.) and the fifth zone (Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, Macau, etc.), they will be slightly changed. According to a senior official of the Postal Administration, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, postage is calculated by converting the value of each country's currency into equivalent value. It is verified that the postage is based on the gold franc as the standard. Previously, the legal currency was equal in value to one gold franc. Currently, one gold franc is worth more than 2.50 yuan of legal currency, so the postage will be increased by one time for calculation to avoid losses. As for the charges for various domestic mail packages, they will still be collected as usual. The Shanghai Postal Administration has already prepared Announcement No. 1566 and is scheduled to officially publish it within days.</p>
<h3>Tianjin's Four Chinese Telegraph: Will Reapply for Protection Order; Judge Mo Su to Return to Shanghai at Month's End; New Application to be Submitted Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that Jones and Rix, of the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm in this city, have received a telegram from the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng assassination case, who have been detained by the Tianjin British Concession Police Department since April. They will submit another petition to the British Supreme Court for China here, requesting the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. It was heard last night (the 24th) that this new petition will be submitted when Judge Mo Su is expected to return to Shanghai within the month. What is even more interesting is that the lawyers in this city have received a telegram from the four Chinese themselves. It is reported that the new petition is being submitted because the writ issued in London was rejected. The reason for the rejection of the writ was that the four men were not detained by Lord Halifax, and the London court could not issue a writ that would benefit Chinese citizens within Chinese territory, and the London judge did not correctly rule that Shanghai could not issue a writ.</p>
<h3>New Fractional Currency Notes: The Truth Behind the Postponed Issuance; Printing Company Prematurely Leaked Sample Sheets; Circulation to the Market Will Resume After Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>After the Central Bank was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to issue fractional currency notes of one and five fen denominations, it signed a printing contract with the American-owned Wing On Printing Company for an initial batch of 500,000 yuan. According to the contract, the printing should have been completed. The Shanghai branch of the bank originally planned to issue the notes starting on the 22nd of this month, but temporarily announced a postponement. A reporter from the "New Voice News Agency" learned from banking circles yesterday that the reason for this postponement was entirely due to</p>
<p>Printing Problems</p>
<p>Contrary to rumors of counterfeit notes being discovered, the Central Bank has not found any such notes as of yet. As for the so-called printing problem, the notes entrusted by the Central Bank to Wing On for printing were made of No. 2 banknote paper. Before the issuance, fractional currency notes without serial numbers or official stamps were found on the Shanghai market, but they were not made of banknote paper, but of</p>
<p>Drawn Paper</p>
<p>These appear to be sample sheets. For the sake of prudence, it has been decided to postpone the issuance temporarily and to negotiate with Wing On Printing Company, the printer, as the discovery of these sample sheets outside the premises indicates negligence on the part of the printing company. Once the negotiations are settled and the reason for the sample sheets being outside the premises is clarified, a</p>
<p>Public Announcement</p>
<p>Regarding the issuance will be made. However, according to a responsible person from the Central Bank, the bank, in view of the shortage of fractional currency in the Shanghai market, followed the instructions of the Ministry and rushed to print the fractional currency notes, hoping to issue them as soon as possible to meet the needs of the market. This decision to postpone the issuance is entirely for the sake of prudence, and procedures are currently being expedited to ensure early issuance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Increase Fares Yesterday: More Than Four Times Higher Compared to Pre-War</h3>
<p>The shipping departments of the Italian-owned Sino-Italian Company, the British-owned Butterfield &amp; Swire, the German-owned Melchers &amp; Co., and the Far Eastern Shipping Company, which operate ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, have, due to the recent sharp decline in foreign exchange rates and the soaring price of coal, and because of the blockade of Zhenhai, which requires ships to anchor outside the port, prolonging the time for passenger and cargo transfer, and increasing expenses accordingly, collectively decided to increase freight and passenger fares to make up for the losses. In addition to the freight rates, which were increased by 50% from the 18th, passenger fares were also announced to be increased yesterday, with varying degrees of increase. Compared with the pre-war period, the increase has reached more than four times.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships' Movements: "Yakumo" and "Iwate" Sailed Away Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The movements of Japanese warships are erratic. The "Yakumo" and "Iwate" returned after leaving the other day, as repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, they suddenly sailed away again, destination unknown. Will they return? It is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Smooth Negotiations on Transport and Distribution: Rice Prices Plunge Yesterday; Registration for Ordering Foreign Rice Begins; Rice-Grabbing Craze Still Not Abated</h3>
<p>The source of rice in the market has been gradually improving in recent days, so the price of rice has fallen again. According to news from the Soybean and Rice Market Management Committee, the rice that went on the market yesterday included 2,360 shi and 90 bags from the No. 17 boat from the river area, and five cars of rice, totaling 625 bags, were also transported from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Added to the rice from other places, the total was no less than eight or nine thousand bags. The market price continued to fall by two yuan compared to the previous day, with the highest quality white japonica rice being 37 yuan and indica rice being 32 yuan. According to a leader in the business community in this city, the Shanghai citizens' food problem is currently being addressed by making the greatest efforts in two aspects: smoothing the source of supply and ordering foreign rice.</p>
<p>Efforts to Negotiate and Smooth the Source</p>
<p>The first step is still to smooth the source of supply. Only as a last resort will foreign rice be ordered. In terms of smoothing the source of supply, negotiations are being conducted through the diplomatic corps, and the negotiations are progressing smoothly. From yesterday, rice merchants have been transporting rice to Shanghai from the countryside. There are many rice workers transporting rice along the Great West Road and Hongqiao Road and other transportation hubs. Rice was also available for sale in the rice shops in western Shanghai yesterday, but most of it was indica rice.</p>
<p>Merchants Ordered 300 Bags Yesterday</p>
<p>After Yu Qiaqing and others jointly decided on the method of ordering foreign rice, the Accountants Association began yesterday to handle the registration for ordering foreign rice. Many groups, organizations, companies, and shops who want to order foreign rice went to the association on the fourth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association on Avenue Edward VII to obtain the registration methods and forms for ordering foreign rice. Those who filled out the forms and registered with the association included: (1) Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, 150 bags; (2) China Tea Company, 100 bags; (3) World Book Company, 50 bags, for a total of 300 bags. After the registration accumulates to a considerable quantity, an order will be placed with foreign countries. As for the amount to be ordered, the original minimum limit was 100 bags, but now, for the sake of universality, it has been changed to 50 bags. It is also heard that</p>
<p>Two Rice-Grabbing Incidents on Hongqiao Road</p>
<p>Jiang Jinsheng, a Ningbo native, lost his job after the Shanghai war and started a small business. Yesterday afternoon, Jiang bought one shi of rice from the countryside in western Shanghai, loaded it on his bicycle, and transported it to Shanghai for sale. Unexpectedly, while passing through the barbed wire fence on Hongqiao Road, he was suddenly stopped and robbed by a gang of people. By the time Jiang shouted for help, half of it (about five dou) had already been snatched away, and they had scattered and fled. Also, on the west side of the East Asia Common Writing School on Hongqiao Road, yesterday there was a truck full of flour. While the coolies were unloading the goods, dozens of ragged compatriots suddenly rushed out and shouted "Rob!" They immediately snatched the flour from the truck and ran away. Although the nearby police officers rushed to suppress the situation, the loss was irreparable.</p>
<h3>"Kaiping" Sails to Tianjin: Evacuating Refugees; Tianjin Floods Becoming Increasingly Dangerous; Many Foreigners Going to Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reports that the Tianjin floods are becoming increasingly dangerous. Ships are now carrying Tianjin residents from Tanggu to Qinhuangdao. Two ships of Jardine Matheson are currently participating in the evacuation efforts. The "Kaiping" which sailed from Shanghai today (the 25th) is also sailing to Tanggu, not directly to Qinhuangdao. A warehouse in the Japanese Concession caught fire yesterday (the 24th), causing considerable damage. It is generally believed that it was caused by the refugees in the building or among the goods being careless. It is heard that the average water depth in the British Concession is six feet, and the general water depth in the Japanese Concession is about fifteen feet. Despite these conditions, there is no cholera outbreak in any of the Chinese ports. However, the Japanese authorities in Tanggu are still conducting cholera inspections on the passengers of British ships, causing delays of up to three days for each ship.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Money Shop Managers</h3>
<p>The Money Shop Association convened an autumn managers' meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., with 41 shops including Fuyuan and Tongrun attending. Managers Xu Wenqing, Pei Yunqing, Zheng Bingquan, Xi Jiming, Lu Mengzhou, Lu Shuchen, etc., were present. Pei Yunxiang presided over the meeting, and Secretary Ge Huaiqing took the minutes. The meeting discussed internal business matters that should be promoted or reformed, and adjourned at 4:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Conflict Between British and French Soldiers and Japanese Soldiers in Yantai: Caused by Rickshaw Puller's Extortion; British Soldiers Unyielding, Japanese Soldiers Could Do Nothing</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that earlier this week, a British patrol</p>
<p>on shore in Yantai clashed with Japanese troops. The incident was sparked</p>
<p>by anti-British demonstrations in Yantai, including stone throwing at consulates</p>
<p>After the movement, a British gunboat sailed from Weihaiwei to Yantai. A British junior officer</p>
<p>hired a rickshaw from the pier to go to a certain tavern.</p>
<p>In the past, the fare was only two jiao, but this year, it is said to have been instigated by</p>
<p>the Yantai "new regime."</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers are also extorting</p>
<p>foreign sailors</p>
<p>entering the</p>
<p>port.</p>
<p>When the British junior officer arrived at the tavern,</p>
<p>he gave the rickshaw puller one Hong Kong dollar, but the rickshaw puller</p>
<p>demanded two dollars. The British officer refused, and a dispute arose.</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, at that time, there was a fake</p>
<p>policeman who arrived at the scene to inquire and then threatened them with a pistol.</p>
<p>The British junior officer seized it and</p>
<p>then returned it. At this time, a Japanese patrol</p>
<p>passed by, and the captain intended to</p>
<p>take the</p>
<p>Briton away.</p>
<p>The British shore</p>
<p>patrol also</p>
<p>arrived</p>
<p>at the scene.</p>
<p>The British captain ordered his men to form a formation and confront the Japanese soldiers, and then asked what had happened.</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers said through an interpreter that they would take the British junior officer to the police station.</p>
<p>The British captain refused, but the Japanese captain insisted that the British junior officer must go with them.</p>
<p>After a long dispute, the fully armed</p>
<p>Japanese</p>
<p>patrol</p>
<p>eventually handed the British junior officer over to the unarmed</p>
<p>British soldiers of the patrol and left. According to reliable sources from Yantai,</p>
<p>after this incident, British sailors were immediately ordered to return to the ship.</p>
<h3>Sand and Gravel Transportation to Shanghai Obstructed: Negotiations with the Japanese; Carrying Price Increased by Seven Cents Per Ton; Labor Satisfied with the Resolution</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese puppet regime took control of sand and gravel, the supply has been interrupted. The only support for the few supplies that do come in is the more than 400 people who are still risking transportation. However, there is not much goods coming in, and the workers' income is not enough to maintain their livelihoods. Moreover, these more than 400 people may lose their jobs at any time. Therefore, on the 23rd, they elected representatives to request the sand and gravel industry, tea and other capitalists to maintain their livelihoods. According to what reporters have learned, this matter has been resolved. The capitalists have agreed to increase the carrying price by seven cents per ton in the future, and the labor side deeply understands the current situation of the sand and gravel industry itself, which is already difficult to maintain, so they have declared their satisfaction with the resolution.</p>
<p>Industry Petition: There are more than 500 firms</p>
<p>in this industry in this city. In order to maintain their business due to the interruption of supply, they specially elected several representatives to petition the Public Works Department on the afternoon of the previous day, requesting negotiations with the Japanese to smooth the supply. It is heard that the Public Works Department, although agreeing to their request, is likely to have no end due to environmental relations.</p>
<p>Mobil Sand and Gravel: According to investigations, before it was controlled,</p>
<p>the total number of carrying workers was more than 2,000. Now, the total number is only more than 400. The number of unemployed people has reached more than 1,500. The total amount of sand and gravel previously detained by the "Jiangnan Company" was 6,000 tons. It is heard that 60 to 70 tons of sand and gravel purchased by the Mobil Oil Depot were also detained by the "Jiangnan Company" the day before yesterday. Mobil Company requested the water patrol to negotiate, but the water patrol declared that it had no right to intervene. The company had no choice but to prepare a document to report to the consulate yesterday afternoon and lodge a protest with the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Seven Banks and Yunnan Motor Company Sign Loan Agreement: Loans Used Entirely to Develop Southwest Transportation; Newly Purchased Cars Arrived in Kunming from Haiphong</h3>
<p>The Central, China, Communications, Farmers, Xinhua, Jin Cheng, and Fu Dian Banks, in order to develop</p>
<p>southwest transportation and facilitate transportation, agreed to the request of the Yunnan Motor Company to provide loans</p>
<p>for the purchase of vehicles. After repeated consultations between the seven banks, the loan agreement with the Yunnan Motor</p>
<p>Company has been signed and finalized. The total amount of the loan is 600,000 national currency.</p>
<p>The Central, China, Communications, Farmers, and Fu Dian Banks each lend 100,000 yuan, and the Xinhua and Jin Cheng Banks each lend 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The loan has been handed over to the Yunnan Motor Company and is specifically for the purchase of automobiles. It is heard that the company's</p>
<p>newly purchased cars have now arrived in Kunming from Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Industrial Five-Year Plan: Japan Cannot Implement; Japanese Newspapers Used to Praise It Vigorously; Now They Remain Silent, Clearly a Failure</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reports that the Japanese authorities have now</p>
<p>admitted that they cannot implement the five-year plan for the development of heavy industry in Manchuria.</p>
<p>The lack of Japanese funds and machinery</p>
<p>is also a major reason for the failure. It is noted that Japanese</p>
<p>newspapers published articles praising the Manchurian</p>
<p>five-year plan in prominent positions for two years,</p>
<p>numbering several thousand. Recently, newspapers in Tokyo published</p>
<p>news in inconspicuous positions, with the smallest headlines,</p>
<p>stating that the Manchurian five-year</p>
<p>plan to increase the production of coal, iron, steel, petroleum, and non-ferrous metals in Manchuria,</p>
<p>scheduled to be completed in 1941, has been</p>
<p>extended for another two years.</p>
<h3>Uniform Inspection: Should Anchor at Wusong Port to Await Inspection; International Code Flag Displayed at the Bow</h3>
<p>Port Director of Shanghai Customs, Tebeck, stated that any</p>
<p>vessels arriving from plague-infected coasts or vessels with infectious</p>
<p>diseases or similar infectious diseases on board</p>
<p>should display the yellow international code Q flag at the bow of the ship</p>
<p>when arriving at Wusong Port, and</p>
<p>should anchor outside Wusong Port to await</p>
<p>inspection by quarantine medical officers. The Shanghai quarantine facilities are</p>
<p>applicable not only to vessels arriving from abroad or the Chinese coast, but</p>
<p>also to vessels arriving from various ports along the Yangtze River or the mouth of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Mr. Tebeck issued a notice today to all Chinese and foreign shipping companies to comply with this regulation.</p>
<h3>Trade Improved in July: Import Surplus Sharply Reduced; Exports Increased by More Than 10 Million Yuan; Import Surplus Reduced by More Than 40 Million</h3>
<p>The nation's foreign trade has improved since July.</p>
<p>In July, imported foreign goods amounted to 11,687,450 yuan,</p>
<p>and exported native goods amounted to 79,884,949 yuan, totaling</p>
<p>196,759,459 yuan. The import surplus was</p>
<p>36,989,561 yuan. Compared with June,</p>
<p>imports decreased by 35,720,714 yuan, and exports increased by</p>
<p>11,459,282 yuan. The import surplus decreased by 47,179,996 yuan.</p>
<h3>Poultry Feathers: Export Prohibited; Feathers Related to Military Use; Camphor Not a Raw Material for Tear Gas</h3>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of exporting goods that aid Japan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government</p>
<p>had long ago sent a list to the provincial governments and customs offices to check and implement. However, regarding</p>
<p>poultry feathers such as chickens, geese, and ducks, there was no explicit regulation on whether to prohibit their export.</p>
<p>Now, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, poultry feathers and wild bird feathers are</p>
<p>all related to military use and are all on the list of prohibited exports.</p>

<h3>Over a Hundred Lured Chinese Laborers: Aboard Ship Back to Shanghai Due to Illness</h3>
<p>The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's "Huashan Maru" returned to Shanghai from North China the day before yesterday, carrying 105 poor and sick Chinese from Qingdao and Aolai. They transferred to smaller vessels to land at the New Customs Wharf. It is said that these poor and sick people were previously recruited by a certain party under the false pretense of recruiting workers to work in Hongkou with a daily wage of eight jiao. Many people responded at the time. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Hongkou, they spent the night in a certain alley and boarded a ship to Qingdao the next morning. Most of them then went to work in a certain place outside the customs under the leadership of a leader sent by a certain party. Those who returned to Shanghai became ill due to sea sickness and acclimatization, so they stayed in Qingdao and boarded the "Huashan Maru" back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Amidst Soaring Rice Prices: Dance Stars Enthusiastically Offer Aid; Rotating Charity Dances to Raise More Relief Funds</h3>
<p>In order to expand fundraising efforts</p>
<p>and replenish relief funds, the authorities of various dance halls in this city</p>
<p>previously established a fundraising committee for the dance hall group, engaging in fundraising</p>
<p>work for refugees. For several months, the results have been remarkable.</p>
<p>Recently, the various dance halls, in view of the soaring</p>
<p>rice prices in Shanghai, the relief for refugees has</p>
<p>increased almost doubled compared to before, resulting in relief funds</p>
<p>requiring more than 100,000 yuan per month. The days ahead are long, and the need for funds</p>
<p>is urgent. They plan to take turns organizing charity dance events for one day each on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The nature of these events is the same as charity sales. The method is to reorganize the previous charity</p>
<p>competition. The Refugee Association will issue lucky draw tickets, and all proceeds will be donated</p>
<p>The dance stars of each dance hall are also unanimously</p>
<p>mobilized to participate and contribute to the righteous cause. Their enthusiasm for charity</p>
<p>is truly admirable. It is heard that the various procedures have</p>
<p>been prepared and will soon be completed. Starting from the 29th of this month,</p>
<p>dance halls throughout the city will take turns starting</p>
<p>the events. It is expected that there will be good results at that time.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Government and Public Promote: "A Bowl of Rice Movement"; Seventeen Governors and Three Hundred Mayors Lead; Saving Meal Money to Help Chinese Refugees</h3>
<p>According to news from international charitable organizations in this city, the movement to relieve Chinese refugees in the United States is still</p>
<p>continuing. Another batch of U.S. wheat donated by the U.S. government will continue to be shipped to China. Various charitable organizations are intensifying efforts to raise funds for the China Disaster Relief.</p>
<p>Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, chairman of the U.S. Relief for Chinese Civilians United Association, was the initiator of the "One Bowl of Rice Movement" last year. Now, Colonel Qi, in view of the unfinished war in the Far East and the fact that Chinese refugees are still in need of rescue, announced that the "One Bowl of Rice Movement" will continue from October 13th of this year.</p>
<p>He still asks the governors of seventeen states and the mayors of three hundred cities in the United States to lead the participation, and to transfer the board money outside of "One Bowl of Rice" to help</p>
<p>fund the relief of Chinese refugees. The Shanghai International Red Cross Society, entrusted by a certain U.S. charity,</p>
<p>is commissioned to investigate the total amount of funds spent on refugee relief and the number of refugees rescued in Shanghai since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The association is currently collecting data from various charities in Shanghai in order to compile and reply.</p>
<h3>Taijiquan Senior: Tian Zhaolin Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yang-style Taijiquan has gained popularity among many people in Shanghai, and many people use it to prevent illness and maintain health.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, famous masters of this style have become scarce, making it difficult for those who are interested to find a teacher.</p>
<p>It is now heard that Teacher Tian Zhaolin, former head of the Wudang School of the Central Guoshu Academy and teacher at the Hangzhou Guoshu Academy,</p>
<p>moved to the countryside after the outbreak of the war in Hangzhou. Recently, he came to Shanghai for personal matters. After being persuaded by friends,</p>
<p>he finally agreed to set up a school and teach students. Teacher Tian is a direct disciple of Mr. Yang Jianhou, and he excels in both character and learning,</p>
<p>and his martial arts are outstanding. He is admired by martial artists and is now a good opportunity</p>
<p>for those who love</p>
<p>Yang-style Taijiquan and want to seek</p>
<p>in-depth study. Any</p>
<p>groups or individuals who want to learn</p>
<p>and study</p>

<h3>Post Office Holidays: All Handled in Accordance with Regulations; No Preferential Treatment for Female Employees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union sent a letter stating: "Regarding the</p>
<p>news article 'Salary Increase Plan for Postal Workers Finalized' published in the Local News column of the third page and ninth edition of your newspaper on the 23rd of this month, which stated: '...It is heard that the Shanghai Administration has a total of seventy or eighty female postal workers and postal assistants, including those who withdrew from Nanjing and came to Shanghai to work. Their treatment is the same as that of male employees, but their leave is slightly more generous...' etc.</p>
<p>Our investigation shows that the leave granted to employees by the post office, such as personal leave, sick leave, marriage leave, and bereavement leave, is all handled in accordance with the regulations in the Postal Regulations and has never</p>
<p>given preferential treatment to female employees. The statement that female employees have slightly more generous leave is not in line with the facts. Now,</p>
<p>to prevent readers from being misled, we have specially prepared this letter to explain and hope that you will check and promptly correct it."</p>
<h3>Establishment of Free Clinics for the Poor</h3>
<p>The Committee for Fundraising for Health Expenses, in view of the fact that poor people in Shanghai are unable to afford medical treatment when they fall ill, which is very distressing,</p>

<h3>Wonderful Methods to Enhance Love Between Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>Lips and teeth are so close, yet sometimes teeth will bite the lips painfully. Therefore, disagreements between husband and wife are indeed unavoidable. As long as one party can apply subtle methods, it is very easy to transform gloom into brightness, and resentment into affection in an instant. Just a moment ago, they were back-to-back, as if there was an infinite chasm between them, but now they are facing each other, laughing, and sweetly immersed in the joys of the heart. This is a common occurrence between husband and wife. As for playful banter and scolding, these can even be a way to enhance love.</p>
<p>Sometimes, unintentional quarrels between husband and wife escalate into real conflicts. Such foolish actions, though they exist, are rare. When trivial matters are blown out of proportion or minor issues are exaggerated, leading to serious consequences, there must be underlying causes that have accumulated over time.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we see a loving couple, both healthy and beautiful, experiencing some minor disputes, we advise them to be honest and express their true feelings to each other. This is necessary in a loving relationship, but one should not be overly stubborn. We do not pay much attention to other things. However, a couple who have lost their love due to age or illness, even though they may appear to have no conflicts on the surface, are actually as different as horses and cattle. One day, a serious crisis will inevitably occur! When secret affairs are conducted and illicit encounters take place, once discovered by the husband, resulting in the killing of the adulterer and adulteress, it will cause a sensation in society. Or, because the husband is weak and impotent, the wife is unwilling to waste her youth and elopes, or makes a bold statement and initiates a divorce lawsuit. Such cases are too numerous to count in today's society.</p>
<p>In such marital entanglements, both men and women are involved, but in reality, the cause is usually more often the man's fault. For example, if a man has early habits of self-abuse resulting in spermatorrhea, or excessive indulgence in sex after marriage, consuming too much of his reproductive gland fluids, it can lead to neurasthenia, incomplete development, premature ejaculation, and impotence. In such cases, the wife's passion often cannot be satisfied, and she may even be left hanging in the air in their love life. How can she not feel resentment in her heart? At the same time, not being able to relax physically and mentally can lead to insomnia, weakness, anemia, and frigidity. Isn't this becoming a sinner in love and plunging oneself into a sea of suffering? However, the above symptoms are not incurable. As long as one actively takes the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Hang Su," it will surely have miraculous effects. This medicine can generate semen, tonify the kidneys, nourish the nerves, and promote development within a day and night after taking it. Continued use will surely cure all symptoms in a short period. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can also achieve the effects of prolonging life, reversing aging, and returning to youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Himi Tuo's Spermatin Tablets" to stop the discharge, which will ensure faster results!</p>
<p>Chen Jun Feipeng, a man from Fujian, 27 years old, suffered from premature ejaculation, impotence, spermatorrhea, and mental weakness due to excessive self-abuse in his youth. The couple often quarreled, causing great pain! Last month, he came to me for treatment, and I immediately told him to buy half a dozen "Sheng Zhi Su" and two boxes of "Himi Tuo's Spermatin Tablets" at the Wuzhou Pharmacy, and take both of them together. The spermatorrhea was cured in a few days. All other symptoms were also cured within a month. The love between the couple became stronger as a result.</p>

<h3>Ladies with Shrunken and Flat Breasts Should Not Deceive Themselves Anymore!</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>With the Power of Science, Why Worry About Self-Injury?</p>
<p>There is a popular saying in our society:</p>
<p>"The wild flower always smells sweeter than the domestic flower?" Looking at the literal meaning of this sentence, it seems somewhat unreasonable, because the domestic flower is not necessarily inferior to the wild flower. But if you think about it carefully and repeatedly, you will find that it has great meaning. Because "domestic flower" is a metaphor for wife, the reason he says this sentence is, of course, that his wife has various things that displease him. In other words, his wife has various shortcomings. According to the social situation in the past, it was naturally inferior to others in terms of feminine virtues, feminine appearance, and feminine skills. If we talk about the current trend of reform, then it especially cannot escape "health and beauty."</p>
<h3>Those with Spermatorrhea and Mental Weakness Must Avoid Worrying</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianzen</p>
<p>The price of rice is expensive at forty yuan per stone, and all prices are soaring. Except for a few members of the bourgeoisie living in ivory towers, I am afraid everyone is immersed in the worries of life: The old cook in the cafeteria says: Each guest must pay more than twenty yuan. The little money sent home by the parents and brothers of the students is not enough to pay for one accommodation and board fee. Those engaged in industry and commerce, the wages they earn after a month of hard work are not enough to pay for one month's food. The rickshaw puller sweats profusely, pulling all day, and the money he earns is not enough to buy rice to feed his wife and children. "What to do?!" A chorus of cries of suffering.</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is a common disease among young people. Almost eight or nine out of ten young people have this disease. If life is usually somewhat satisfactory, one can be pure-hearted and have few desires, and abstain from self-abuse. If one can also take the special effect medicine "Himi Tuo's Spermatin Tablets," it is very easy to cure and is not a big deal. However, young people with spermatorrhea must avoid worrying, because worrying is the most draining of energy and damaging to the nerves. Spermatorrhea, because of the loss of the source of life, is also the most draining of energy and damaging to the nerves. Therefore, worrying not only promotes the deterioration of spermatorrhea, but also greatly increases the risk of spermatorrhea and leakage of sperm, and can also directly weaken the body. For young people with spermatorrhea, adding the worries of life is like a weak country suffering from internal troubles and external aggression at the same time, and it is simply on the verge of collapse!</p>
<p>What causes spermatorrhea? The most common cause is self-abuse and indulgence. If one can pay attention to health preservation and seek treatment early when spermatorrhea first starts, it is the best policy. If one delays treatment or worries excessively, waiting for the symptoms to worsen and the essence and blood to dry up, then all symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging will be numerous. Such young people are simply disabled. What else can they do? I am afraid that in married life, they will also show their uselessness, be hated by their wives, and stage various tragedies in the family...</p>
<p>For the treatment of worsening spermatorrhea, in addition to still taking "Himi Tuo's Spermatin Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop the discharge, it is also necessary to take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to fundamentally nourish the brain and kidneys, increase the essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use of this medicine can promote development and regulate metabolism, and it will surely restore perfect health in a short period of time. Those who can come to our clinic for electrotherapy and injections can be guaranteed to be cured.</p>
<p>Because human nature is to love beauty, in this era of advocating breast beauty, buttock beauty, and curve beauty, who is willing to marry ugly women with shrunken breasts, thin buttocks, and no curves? Although ugly women can still marry men through indirect and roundabout relationships (such as not seeing each other before marriage, or only happening after marriage), once discovered by the husband, when compared with healthy and beautiful women in public gatherings, her husband will naturally sigh, "The wild flower is always sweeter than the domestic flower." Therefore, such women are not only easily hated by men and have no happiness, but also feel endless pain in their own bodies and minds! If you want to remedy it, you can only rely on the power of science. According to world-renowned gynecologist Kang Delin and my experience, it is generally recognized that taking the female "Sheng Zhi Su," a reproductive gland ovarian preparation, is the most effective and effective treatment. The main reason for the shrinking of the breasts is that the function of the ovaries is affected by self-abuse, chest binding, irregular menstruation, persistent leucorrhea, malnutrition, and chronic malnutrition, which affects metabolism. Therefore, if you take the female "Sheng Zhi Su," which is made from the ovarian hormones of strong animals, it will be 100% effective. If you continue to take it, it will not only make the shrunken breasts stand tall, but also make the buttocks plump, the face rosy, and keep youth.</p>

<h3>Special Treatment for Redness, Swelling, and Pain in Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>In the acute stage of gonorrhea, the glans and foreskin become inflamed and swollen due to the irritation of the gonococcal toxin, which is a common symptom in the acute stage. The area around the urethral opening of the patient is often red, swollen, and painful. The severity of these symptoms is always related to the strength of the gonococcus. If the toxicity is strong, the lower part of the urethral opening, both sides of the frenulum of the penis, and even the entire foreskin, will be edematous and swollen with a shiny appearance, accompanied by pain. However, the serous fluid that accumulates in this swelling is similar to hydrocele and is not pus. Since the disease has progressed to this point, the invasion of the bacteria has spread to the paraurethral glands, Littre's glands, and follicles. If these areas are indeed invaded by the toxin, miliary to pea-sized swollen nodules will occur in these areas, which can be detected by palpation. As a result, the urethral cavity is obstructed and narrowed by these nodules, making urination even more difficult.</p>
<p>To detect these conditions, a new-style urethroscope should be used for detailed examination to know the truth of the disease. Then, use the German Lymph-Filtering Electrical Therapy to directly irradiate the gonococci in the paraurethral glands, which cannot be eradicated by local surgery. Only Lymph-Filtering Electrical Therapy can penetrate deep into the lesions. On the one hand, chemical therapy and specially made autogenous vaccines are used as injections. In this way, all inflammatory and swelling symptoms will completely subside within a week, and urethral nodules can also be eliminated and restored to their original state within two weeks. This treatment is the crystallization of my ten years of experience.</p>

<h3>An Open Letter (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Friends! The quality of our people is very good. It is just that in the past, it was oppressed by that (1) culture on paper, (2) politics that did not take the country and the people as its goal, (3) a system of etiquette that only held others responsible for implementing it. This dark mass had oppressed us for thousands of years. After this resolute war of resistance, everyone suddenly awakened. Culture on paper is not culture. Everyone should quickly study the various needs of peacetime life and wartime. Without a country, can there be people? Without people, can there be a country? Without a country and people, where is the political life? To save the country, one must put saving the country into practice. To save the people, one must put saving the people into practice. Facts are forcing us step by step, and you cannot but work practically.</p>
<p>Heaven helps those who help themselves. Because of the efforts in human affairs, the provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan all celebrated a bumper harvest last year (a part of Guizhou had a poor harvest). This year, they continue to have a bumper harvest. Sichuan's harvest reached 90% last year, and this year it is expected to reach 95%.</p>
<p>However, I am unwilling to be overly optimistic. There are many conditions that must be prepared for the victory of the war of resistance and the success of national construction. Moreover, there are other conditions besides ourselves. If we are slightly careless, the situation will immediately change. I still hold on to my old view that the final victory is only 50% certain, depending on how we work. I often say that we must not be complacent, and we must not deceive ourselves, but we cannot be without self-confidence. Take 100% as the goal of success. If we work hard to 90%, we will succeed immediately if we get 10% of the opportunity. Moreover, our country's natural resources are so rich, its geographical location is so superior, and its people are so motivated and loyal, it depends on how we work.</p>
<p>The above are all my heartfelt words that I pour out to you. There is one point I would like to earnestly say to you. Without a country, the nation has no room for survival. Look at the Jewish nation, with its profound scientific knowledge and strong economic power. It possesses almost all the necessary conditions for human survival, but it lacks only "a country." Once hit, it has no place to stand. Several friendly countries wanted to help, but they could not help in the end. Isn't that tragic? Friends, among our friends, if someone cannot endure the hardship of the environment and wants to leave the country, only seeking the local survival of the people, or even leaving the group and only seeking the survival of the individual, there is no such cheap thing in the world. The result will only be tragic, only regret! As for me, I have been educated by my parents, elders, and teachers since I was a child, and nurtured by the country. Since I was an adult, although I have made some efforts, I only feel that my contribution is too small. I lament that I was born in national difficulties, grew up in national difficulties, and now I am old in national difficulties. Watching countless compatriots sacrifice their lives for national difficulties, including many relatives and friends, known and unknown, is a painful thing for me. I am also watching the rising generation of young people vying to continue to sacrifice their lives for the national difficulties, which is a heroic thing! As the Book of Songs says, "The stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade." It also says, "My heart is not stone, it cannot be turned." Take the stone that can be polished to increase my knowledge and encourage my courage, and take the stone that cannot be turned to temper my sentiments. I dare not deceive myself to deceive others. I can only work hard to help myself, so as to seek God's help. Please shout loudly to tell my general friends that the new life of the Republic of China is in the vast body of the people. (End)</p>
<h3>Rampant Autumn Sun in the City / Pacific Hurricane Will Threaten Shanghai / Huangpu River Will Have High Tide Starting on the 29th</h3>
<p>The weather in the city is still hot, and the degree of depression is increasing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rampant Autumn Sun</p>
<p>The temperature in the city has been hovering between 94 and 95 degrees these days. The autumn sun is rampant, and the heat is unmatched. In addition, the weather is sultry and depressing, leading to the prevalence of seasonal diseases. True cholera has been continuously discovered. Recently, a type of beriberi heart disease has also occurred. On average, one in seven people who contract it dies.</p>
<p>Hurricane Advance</p>
<p>Pacific hurricanes have sprung up one after another this year. The hurricane that erupted off Guam Island in the Pacific Ocean moved to 20 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, and then turned from northwest-west to northwest. If this is the case, Shanghai will also be threatened. However, it is still far from Shanghai at present, and we are paying attention to its development.</p>
<p>Another High Tide</p>
<p>The Huangpu River will have another seven-day high tide from the 29th to September 4th. The highest predicted volume is 12 feet 1 inch and 7 points, less than 9 inches from the bund embankment. The lowest is also 10 feet. The normal amount is between 11 feet and 12 feet. At that time, the low-lying roads in the city will be greatly troubled by water accumulation. If there is a rapid wind and rainstorm, the tide may overflow the bank.</p>
<h3>Robbers of Rice / Lenient Sentences / Two People Given Suspended Sentences After Being Found Guilty</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, everything has become expensive. Rice is the most expensive and soaring. The general poor are forced by livelihood to take risks. The trend of robbing rice is almost daily. At 7:25 p.m. the night before, more than a hundred poor people suddenly crowded into the Guanghua Rice Store opened by Qin Wentao at No. 206, Lane 51, Xinzha Bridge Road, and robbed all seven piculs of white rice, worth 200 yuan, and left in separate directions. After the investigation by West Constable No. 77 of the Xinzha Police Station, Mei Jingen, a 17-year-old from Changzhou, and Lu Shiqing, from Chongming, were arrested, and two small bags of rice were found. They were taken to the police station together. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the police station lawyer, prosecuted them for theft under Article 321, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Law, and stated the facts of the case, saying that the defendant Mei Jingen was only 17 years old and could be given a reduced sentence according to the law. Moreover, this case occurred due to the environment, so he asked the court to consider it when sentencing. When questioned, the defendants confessed that they had taken this measure because rice was expensive and their livelihood was difficult, and asked for leniency. Judge Liu Yugui verified the confessions and sentenced Mei Jingen and Lu Shiqing to three months' imprisonment each for joint theft, suspended for two years, ordered them to be handed over for probation, and returned the stolen rice.</p>
<h3>Shells Fly / Injure Children</h3>
<p>A boy named Jin Hegen, 7 years old, lived in a certain house in Zhenru Town. In the afternoon the day before, the child was enjoying the cool outside the door. Suddenly, a shell flew over, and shrapnel hit the child's left waist. Afterwards, his mother accompanied him to Shanghai, and he was sent to the hospital for treatment at 10:30 p.m. last night.</p>
<h3>Forcing a Child Bride / To Sell Herself to Make a Living / The Old Couple Arrested for Investigation</h3>
<p>Pang Zhengshan, from Beiping, 45 years old, lived upstairs at No. 325 Avenue Dubail, with his wife Pang Zou, 36 years old, from Hunan, and a son named Pang Dongchuan, 18 years old, who is currently an apprentice in a bristle factory. The Pang couple brought a girl from Hubei named Zhu Xiaomao (15 years old this year) as a child bride for their son. However, Pang Zhengshan had recently lost his job and had no support. The family's livelihood was affected. Every night, he ordered his wife Zou to dress up the daughter-in-law Xiaomao and take her to the Da Shijie amusement park to welcome the patrons and live her life as a prostitute. If the girl disobeyed slightly, she would be punished. The girl reported to the French Concession Police Station the day before, requesting help. According to the report, the head of the police believed that the behavior of the Pang couple was bad, so he sent detectives to arrest the Pang Zhengshan Pang Zou couple and take them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The lawyer of the police station, Yuan Jiahuang, stated the facts of the case, saying that the defendants were under investigation for obstructing public morals and causing injury, and requested custody for investigation, and rescheduled the interrogation. After verifying the words, Judge Zhang Minsheng declared that the case was related to public morals, and announced that bystanders were prohibited. After briefly questioning the defendants, he ordered them to be detained pending further investigation and interrogation on another date.</p>
<h3>A Barber / Rapes a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Wang A'mei, a girl from Suzhou, is now 16 years old and lives at No. 246 Kaifeng Road. She used to work as a waitress in a hotel on Seymour Road. However, Huo Yufa, a barber from Yangzhou, who worked at the Moore Barber Shop nearby, was 23 years old. Because he often came to the hotel to buy wine, he got to know Wang A'mei. He repeatedly teased her and used playful words. On the 23rd, Huo lured Wang to Room 12 of the Huxi Hotel at No. 18 Shanchang Lane, Carter Road, under the pretext of watching a play. He used violence and committed rape twice. It was not until the morning of the 24th that Wang's relative Hu Zhongli found out, so he reported the information to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent Detective Wang Xianliang to arrest Huo Yufa, Wang A'mei, and the blood-stained pants together and take them to the police station. Wang was sent to Guangren Hospital, where it was verified that her hymen was ruptured. Huo was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, prosecuted him for rape under Article 221, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The court declared that bystanders were prohibited because this case was related to public morals. As a result, Huo was detained pending further verification.</p>
<h3>A Traveler Fell From / The Oriental Hotel</h3>
<p>At 3:36 p.m. yesterday, Wu Jicai (38 years old), a local resident who made a living as a rice broker, a lodger in room 549 on the fifth floor of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, suddenly jumped from the fifth floor for some reason and fell into the road. He suffered extremely serious head injuries and fainted. Later, the Chinese police summoned an ambulance to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment. His life was in danger.</p>

<h3>Four Years of Marriage Without Consummation: Wife's Divorce Suit Fails, Court Rejects Petition Based on Empty Claims, Appeal Filed, Defendant Summoned for Further Verification</h3>
<p>Xiang Meixiang, a woman from Ningbo residing at No. 20 Ningbo Road in the Public Concession, is 25 years old this year. On the 27th day of a certain month in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], she married Shen Jiaju, a wealthy local man (28 years old this year, residing at No. 45 Taoyuan Village, Lafayette Road; a graduate of Aurora University and a devout Catholic) as his wife, following her father's wishes. After the marriage, Xiang refused to consummate the marriage with her husband, resulting in a lack of affection between them. Since June 1, 1936, Xiang</p>
<p>returned to her maiden home</p>
<p>on a pretext, and has not returned to her husband's home since. Last month, Xiang engaged lawyer Wu Linkun to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Civil Division, seeking a divorce and demanding over 40,000 yuan in alimony and other expenses. The defendant, Shen Jiaju, engaged lawyer Tang Hao to respond, opposing the divorce. After Judge Ma Yishu heard the case, he found that Xiang Meixiang's claims were without merit and ruled against her. Xiang Meixiang, dissatisfied with the loss, engaged lawyer Jiang Yiping to file</p>
<p>an appeal</p>
<p>with the High Third Branch Court.</p>
<p>The court opened an investigation hearing yesterday. The appellant, Shen Jiaju, was absent due to illness and was represented by lawyer Tang Hao. The appellant, Xiang Meixiang, along with her lawyer, Jiang Yiping, attended the hearing and stated the reasons for seeking a divorce, claiming that they were husband and wife in name only. In addition to requesting a divorce, she also requested that the appellee, Shen Jiaju, be ordered to pay the appellant</p>
<p>alimony and other expenses</p>
<p>of over 40,000 yuan in a lump sum. Lawyer Tang Hao then declared to the court that the appellant's claims were completely empty and that the fault for the lack of consummation lay with the appellant. He requested that the appeal be rejected according to the law. The court verified the statements and announced that the hearing would be adjourned to summon the appellee, Shen Jiaju, himself to appear in court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Sham Raw Silk Export Inspection Office: Oppressing Chinese Silk, Japanese Silk's Overseas Trade Stagnates, Resorting to This Desperate Measure in a Futile Attempt to Recover</h3>
<p>The sham "Department of Industry of the Reformed Government," recently instigated by the Japanese, has also organized a so-called "Raw Silk Export Inspection Office" in Shanghai, with the intention of forcefully suppressing China's foreign trade in raw silk. The location of the office has been determined to be in the Hongkou area, and the business office will be located on the upper floors of a certain bank on the Bund. It is reported that the so-called inspection methods have been distributed to various silk mills and export merchants. It is said that the procedures are extremely harsh and the work is abnormal. The intention is obviously to try to restrict exports. It is reported that the Japanese have set the first day of next month as the starting date for this work, but it is still difficult to predict whether it can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Japanese Overproduction</p>
<p>China's major exports are silk and tea, followed by tung oil, tungsten ore, and so on. In order to realize their ambitions to seize China's international market sales, the Japanese adopted Chinese silk and tea seeds and actively engaged in production and sales, resulting in competitive sales that have negatively impacted China. In recent years, both silk and tea have seen a decline. However, due to the deep trust of various countries in China, coupled with the boycott of Japanese goods everywhere, Japanese silk exports have greatly decreased, resulting in overproduction. Now, they are resorting to an inspection conspiracy, hoping to complete their dumping attempt.</p>
<p>Chinese Silk Sells Well</p>
<p>China's foreign trade in raw silk has always been very developed. Although the war is currently ongoing, foreign sales are still very strong. According to reliable statistical reports, the export of raw silk from the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang alone is 100,000 bales per day (excluding other provinces). The annual export to the United States is 200,000 bales, slightly less to the United Kingdom and France. The export of Chinese silk is dominated by New York in the United States, Marseille in France, London in the United Kingdom, and Mumbai in India, followed by other countries. As for Japan's recent exports to the United States and France, the annual export is only 600,000 bales, which has decreased to 60-70% compared to previous years.</p>

<h3>Countless Swindling Tricks: Jewelry Store Cheated of a Large Sum</h3>
<p>The old jewelry store at No. 513 Avenue Joffre, opened by Weng Kai from Chaozhou, specializes in valuable old jewelry such as diamonds, gemstones, and jadeite. At around 4:00 pm on the 24th, two well-dressed customers, A and B, came to the store and selected four diamond rings displayed in the display case (two with one diamond each and two with three diamonds each) and one gold bracelet, totaling</p>
<p>880 yuan in price. Customer A took out a package of banknotes and handed it to the store owner, Weng Kai. After inspecting the money and confirming that it was correct, he put it into the safe and handed the diamond rings and gold bracelet to customer A. After the transaction was completed, customer A suddenly asked the store owner, Weng Kai, to send an apprentice to his house to deliver the diamond rings he had purchased. Weng refused because there was no one available in the store to send. Customer A immediately expressed displeasure and wanted to return the goods and</p>
<p>get a refund. Weng agreed and opened the safe to return the original package of banknotes to the customer and took back the diamond rings. At this time, customer B, who had come with customer A, came forward to persuade customer A, saying that since he had already purchased them, why should he break off the deal just because of the delivery? He advised customer A to take them home himself. Customer A immediately agreed and handed the package of banknotes returned by the store owner, Weng Kai, back to him, sealed. Since the banknotes had already been</p>
<p>inspected and counted, he did not inspect them again and put them back into the safe. He then handed over the four diamond rings and one gold bracelet to customer A. Customer A put them into his pocket and left with B. That evening, after closing the store, the store owner, Weng Kai, inspected the day's sales proceeds. When he opened the package and counted the money again, he was shocked to find that out of the 880 yuan in the package, only the two outermost banknotes, each worth 10 yuan, were genuine banknotes. The banknotes inside were all</p>
<p>counterfeit bills. He was extremely distraught and immediately reported the fraud to the French police station, describing the purchase process and the appearance of the two customers, requesting the police to investigate and arrest them and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Chiang Chung-chia Case: Both Parties Reach Settlement</h3>
<p>Chiang Chung-chia, the owner of Chiang Chung-chi Construction Company, residing in the Mainland Village on Rue Lupan, was previously sued in the Second Special District Court by Ms. Yu, residing in the Taishan Apartments on Route Massenet, and Yu Yifei, residing at No. 7 Chengdu Village on Chengdu Road, demanding payment of over 50,000 yuan in deposit principal and interest. After Judge Lu Chia-jui opened the trial, Chiang's lawyer, Chu Yi-sheng, stated that Chiang had long prepared the deposit money and interest for repayment and had never delayed or ignored the matter. The problem was that Chiang insisted on making the payment by remittance, while Yu and others insisted on cash payment, which led to the failure to resolve the issue. Judge Lu believed that there was a high possibility of reconciliation in this case and adjourned the trial, instructing both parties to reconcile outside the court. At the subsequent hearing, both parties were represented by their lawyers and stated that the case was being mediated by friends and that both parties had reached an agreement. The court verified the statements and approved the settlement, then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Case of Robbery of Police Detective's Gun: All Four Defendants Punished According to Law</h3>
<p>Wu Wen-kang, a Chinese detective from the French Concession Police Station, was mistaken for a gangster by personnel in the Futai Egg Store at No. 285 Ningxing Street when he was performing his duties at the beginning of this month. They believed that he was helping the debtor, Lu Axiang, come to threaten them, resulting in a conflict. As a result, the gun worn by Detective Wu was snatched. The French police ordered detectives to detain the owner of the egg store, Tong Lunghua, and employees Ni Baosheng, Yang Sanlang, and Yang Shangzhen, and handed them over to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for prosecution on charges of obstructing official duties and other crimes. During the trial of the case, the court received an anonymous letter stating that the defendants, Tong Lunghua and others, had spent 1,000 yuan to influence the court, 1,000 yuan to influence the police detectives, and 500 yuan to influence the police lawyer. Judge Chiu Huan-ying, who was presiding over the trial, specifically presented the letter to the defendants and informed them that the court would handle the case according to the law and would not accept bribes. If the defendants had been deceived, they should demand the money from the swindlers or prosecute them according to the law. Regarding the case against the defendants, after questioning, he announced that a verdict would be issued. Yesterday morning, Judge Chiu announced the verdict: Ni Baosheng was sentenced to four months of imprisonment, Tong Lunghua was sentenced to four months of imprisonment, Yang Sanlang and Yang Shangzhen were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Tong and Yang Shangzhen and Yang Sanlang were each granted a two-year suspended sentence. The verdict was pronounced in court.</p>

Each of them held pistols and sharp axes, forbidding anyone to make a sound. They robbed the factory of a total of 386 yuan in legal tender and gold jewelry and fled in a hurry. Later, two members of the gang of thieves, Dou Bichen and Wang Jinlong, both natives of Jiangbei, were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. It was also found that Dou and Wang, between June 2nd of this year, had conspired with the fugitive leader, Da Wanggan, and Xiao Sanzi, and others, to rob the residence of Xie Maochun at No. 1894 Da Xi Road of property worth 1,750 yuan.

The police officer confiscated the drugs and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, described the case and requested a strict investigation. The evidence was presented for inspection. Judge Jiang Shuzi, after questioning, sentenced Pu Gengsheng to twelve years of imprisonment and confiscated the heroin.</p>

The case was discovered by Jin Wanrong, a Chinese detective from the Yangshupu Police Station. The day before yesterday, he collaborated with a Western detective to arrest Mao and Chen, and Mai Shanhua one after another. The three stolen motors were recovered at No. 117 Longmen Road and No. 98 Qiwupu Road, along with the suspected accomplice, a woman named Liu Chen, and were taken to the police station.

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Supplementary Measures for Primary School Textbooks, Directing All Provincial Education Departments to Comply</h3>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: The Ministry of Education's supplementary measures for primary and secondary school textbooks for the coming year stipulate that if secondary school textbooks cannot be purchased in time, mimeographed lecture notes may be distributed for temporary use. An order has been issued to comply. Five temporary measures have now been formulated for primary schools, and all provincial education departments are specifically ordered to instruct their subordinates to comply. The measures are listed below: (1) The compiled textbooks for various primary school subjects that have been completed shall be printed (typeset or lithographed) and distributed by the provincial education departments for use in their respective primary schools. (2) The compiled version of history textbooks for upper primary school has not yet been completed. The provincial education departments shall separately select existing teaching materials and distribute them to their respective primary schools for mimeographing and use. (3) School libraries may purchase sufficient copies of textbooks for various subjects for children of all grades to borrow in the future when books are lacking. (4) Writing assignments for upper-grade elementary school students will be expanded to focus on copying textbooks for various elementary school subjects. The copied textbooks will be individually corrected by the teachers at any time to distribute to grades or schools that lack textbooks. (5) Train children to take care of their original textbooks so that they remain intact for borrowing or selling to grades or schools that lack textbooks. The first to fourth volumes of short-term primary school textbooks have been issued and the rest will be issued successively after they are finished. Comply accordingly, etc. The Zhejiang Education Department believes that the provincial guerrilla areas and counties' primary schools' required textbooks have already been made up by the department. The back county's textbooks can be supplied by the bookstores at the moment, so the department's first and second methods will be followed when necessary, and the third and fifth methods should be followed by primary schools immediately to meet current needs.</p>
<h3>Education Expert Jiang Wenyu Discusses Primary School Teachers in the Great Era (1): Final Victory Depends on the Countryside and the People; Responsibility for Approaching the People Rests with Primary School Teachers</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Dispatch) Education expert Mr. Jiang Wenyu recently wrote an article discussing the importance of the mission of primary and secondary school teachers in the great era, and that there should be reasonable measures for their material and spiritual treatment. His detailed account is very pertinent and can speak for 700,000 primary school teachers nationwide (according to the Ministry of Education's statistics, there are more than 700,200 current primary school teachers nationwide). It is also welcomed by those who care about educational construction. Now we excerpt his original text below:</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has been going on for two years. Bloody experience tells us that to achieve final victory, we can only rely on the countryside and the people. President Chiang said it well, "The way to achieve final victory lies in the vast countryside and the strong will of the people." He also said, "Politics is more important than military affairs, and propaganda is more important than combat." It can be seen that the countryside and the people are the key to our victory in the War of Resistance and the success of national construction. But how can we organize the countryside and mobilize the people? This is a serious practical problem.</p>
<p>I am engaged in education. Although I cannot avoid talking about my profession, I truly believe that education is the best tool for mobilizing and organizing the people. The so-called "politics" and "propaganda" are also educational tools. We know that more than 80% of our country is illiterate. It is impossible to give a profound lecture to people who do not know a single word and ask them to resist aggression and build the country. This is where the tool of universal education comes into play. The people in our country's countryside are emotional and trustworthy. It is not appropriate to give them orders, announcements, laws, or police. This requires the tool of social education. But who will carry out the tool of education? Of course, universities and middle schools are places of education, but who is closest to the people and who is closest to the countryside? Who is most suitable to mobilize the masses of people? I believe it is only primary school education. In big cities and remote rural areas, in which corner is there no primary school? A few years ago, a rural construction worker published an article entitled "Primary School Teachers Teach the Country to Perish." The article used primary school teachers as the backbone of rural society to organize farmers. They can teach literacy and enlightenment, and they can defend against bandits and resist the enemy. Although this article is exaggerated, I deeply sympathize with and believe that primary school teachers can mobilize the people.</p>
<p>This time, I heard and saw the reports and proposals of various aspects of the National Education Conference, as well as the actual situation in various places described by colleagues at the meeting. Among them, there were many unspeakable worries or excitements in my heart about the problem of primary school teachers. Now, I will not go into detail about the service situation and treatment methods of teachers in various places, as well as all the praiseworthy and lamentable facts. What we want to discuss is, in this period of carrying out the War of Resistance and simultaneously carrying out national construction, how should we expect ordinary primary school teachers who are related to the national destiny, and how should we treat them? These two levels must be more important and urgently need to be resolved.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Educational Qualifications for Students of Vocational Education Society's Supplementary Schools to Enter Higher Education and Graduate, the Ministry of Education Has Approved</h3>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Education Society in this city has been promoting supplementary education for more than ten years, and has established seven supplementary schools, with a total of more than 10,000 students. It holds the authority of supplementary education in Shanghai. It is reported that the society, in view of the large number of students displaced by the spread of the war, has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Education of the National Government to allow it to establish supplementary schools, and that the academic achievements of the students in the supplementary schools should be equivalent to those of the corresponding schools. The Ministry of Education has approved it with the document No. Bu 87 Zi 05243. All supplementary schools established by the society can provide certificates for students to participate in the graduation or academic examinations of a certain stage. After passing the examinations, they will obtain the graduation or academic qualifications of that stage of school. With these qualifications, they can apply for admission to higher education or transfer to other schools.</p>

<h3>Finance: Chinese Merchants Eagerly Settle September US Dollar, News of German-Polish Conflict Arrives, Market Buying Wind Suddenly Subsides</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing revelation showed no ups or downs. The grey market for British and American exchange rates was difficult to predict due to rapidly changing international news and unstable sentiment. Initially, it was reported that US President Wisford had appealed to the Italian Emperor for peace, and that Poland was willing to negotiate with Germany, making it possible to avoid war. Western merchant Sassoon aggressively bought, and Chinese merchants also vigorously bought September futures for the US dollar, causing the situation to tighten temporarily. British gold once softened to three and a half pence, and the US dollar also tightened to 6.75 yuan. No one paid attention to September British gold. After 10:30 AM, Reuters reported that conflict had begun on the German-Polish border, so the buying wind subsided, and telegrams from Hong Kong were frequent, coupled with the emergence of many long positions from Chinese firms, causing the trend to reverse to loosen and soften. In the afternoon, British gold hardened to 3.6875 pence, and the US dollar also loosened to 7.125 yuan. However, according to the listed price, HSBC's absorption was quite good, and the loosening trend was blocked again.

Since the removal of the winning lottery, it has hovered inside and outside the mark for nearly two weeks, the fundamental reason for its rise but inability to stand firm is due to many changes in the environment and the lack of large households.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculators Regroup, Cotton Yarn Rebounds Steeply, Double Horse and Earth Each Return Sixty or Seventy Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had fallen for two consecutive days, rebounded steeply yesterday, with a dramatic rise and a violent situation. Half of this state was due to the rapid decline and excessive degree over the past two days. The price of 20s Double Horse plunged from 785 yuan to 650 yuan, a difference of 135 yuan. As for the European situation, although the situation is tense, it has not yet broken out, so foreign exchange has shrunk again, and most operators have regrouped and purchased in the market. In addition, the German-Polish situation has eased today, and buyers' enthusiasm is strong, so the market price is soaring, but actual transactions are still watching and silent, all being transactions between the same industry.</p>
<p>Spot yarn, initially, due to better news and improved environment in the afternoon of the previous day, the market rebounded and recovered, and buyers gathered to open prices, immediately jumping a huge thirty or forty yuan.

<p>Same industry 910 Mainland 75</p>
<p>Hong Kong 35 Jiangxi 20</p>
<p>Statistics 1,040</p>
<p>The recent two days of surging waves in the spot yarn market, with a huge range of rises and falls, make people talk about tigers and change color. This is due to the general speculative merchants, who are distracted and uncertain, raising indiscriminately. According to a certain party, the attitude of the spot yarn industry is still flat, and spot yarn transactions are also sluggish, but the general gold gang and securities gang often stir up trouble, the amount of entry and exit is huge, and it changes every moment, creating market unrest. Yesterday's fall and today's rise both exceeded the norm and were shocking to hear.</p>
<h3>Although Cotton Sales Have Not Improved, Cotton Merchants Are Unwilling to Sell Loosely</h3>
<p>The transaction of Chinese and foreign spot cotton is still flat, and manufacturers' digestion is even more rare. Only Anda Factory advanced 200 pieces of Huisi Deng at a price of 146 yuan, (banknote sent to the factory), and Fuchengxin advanced 400 pieces of Canada at a price of 124 yuan, (banknote warehouse delivery), and the rest had no transactions. The price was slightly better than the previous day by three yuan. Probably because the yarn market has fallen for two consecutive days, and yesterday saw a dramatic surge of sixty or seventy yuan, resulting in unstable sentiment and reduced buying interest, and the price is still tight. At this time of sudden ups and downs, there is no hope of starting to purchase. The Japanese factory did not advance a single package, and the source of northern Jiangsu is estimated to have arrived at 388 packages of Tongzhou flower, it is said.</p>
<p>Another message: The exchange rate of foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai suddenly tightened again yesterday, and overseas cotton markets all rose. Converted into legal currency, the price of raw cotton rose by more than ten yuan per dan. Although the yarn price rose yesterday, people's hearts are very uncertain about the political situation in Europe, and the cotton price is high, so the transactions are very bleak. However, most of the industry is unwilling to loosen the cotton price.</p>
<p>Overseas cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was active again yesterday, and speculators were very active in purchasing due to the urgency of the European political situation. Overseas cotton merchants also aggressively purchased in the market, and the Liverpool gang was dragging in in the market, so the market price rose by seven or eight pound sounds. Yesterday, Liverpool cotton prices soared by 18.9 points due to the political situation. India, including forecasts, also surged four rupees.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Prices Return Tired, Dropping One or Two Yuan, Japonica and Indica Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>Du Japonica: The source is quite plentiful, with nearly 20 shipments arriving from Hexia, Songjiang, and Nangang. The car wheel bun arrived at Wuhu, and the new and old sharp and southern helped Japonica of northern Jiangsu arrived in over 5,000 packages. However, the shops' digestion was weak, causing the market to be quiet and the situation to return tired. The cargo owners had no choice but to throw prices to seek the night, and the result was a drop of one or two yuan. If the high Xijing opened at 38 yuan and a half to 38 yuan, the Su Tong Kun Japonica 37 yuan and a half, decided at 34 yuan and eight jiao, Hexia early and late rice, regardless of the Songjiang Nangang goods, all opened at 35 yuan, the original package 37 yuan, high Chen Wujian 35 yuan, new Jiang and Jiashan Jiaxing Chuanjian opened high 34 yuan, medium 33 yuan, new Wujian 33 yuan and a half to 33 yuan, varying yuan 30 yuan. It is estimated that only 4,300 or 400 packages were traded.</p>
<p>Guest Indica: New and old Indica arrived one after another, probably because after the high-flying Shanghai market, traffickers everywhere rushed to transport. In total, six or seven thousand packages of new and old Indica from Wuhu, Nanjing, northern Jiangsu, and Taizhou were shipped, and most of them have been shipped out and transferred to the warehouse, so people's hearts have returned to flat, cargo owners no longer pull the trick, and the advancing households are afraid of grabbing rice, and the need is also light, so the city is unanimously downstream. The new Indica that previously opened at 345 yuan is now only 323 yuan, and the old Indica is up to 34 yuan and seven jiao, but the special northern Jiangsu new Indica still needs 34 yuan and four jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday's entry and exit were both light, Saigon did not open, and old Chen small lines opened at 32 yuan and a half, also a small price of a cow yuan.</p>
<h3>Noodle Flour Darkly Loose, Wheat Still High</h3>
<p>The flour market has already seen a dark looseness, because rice prices have rebounded and fallen, people's hearts are gradually flat, and each factory can supply as much as possible for the current retail sales, and does not restrict, so the shops in this street directly advance goods from the flour factory, endlessly, and transactions continue to have forty to fifty thousand packages, the factory disk is still holding the original disk, the retail is 6 yuan and 4.7 fen per package, but the recycled goods have returned to within 6 yuan and five jiao, and it is heard that the Bat brand foreign flour has also opened four to five thousand packages, the price is only six yuan and a half, and the market is gradually tending to loosen, it is said.</p>
<p>The source of wheat is endless, and the goods arriving are still dominated by Beijing, Zhen, Suzhou, and Wuxi, but because the market has returned to flat, rice prices have fallen, and international relations have changed, the intention of hoarders to advance is lazy, and transactions are very rare, and the market has immediately grown tired. However, because the factory needs are still good, and the cost of hoarders' flour exceeds the factory disk, the counterattack is also powerful, so the advance price has also seen an increase of one jiao. The overall market is estimated to have been purchased by the Fu and Fu factories for 9,000 packages of wheat from Suzhou and Wuxi, the price being 9 yuan and 5 jiao to one jiao, and hoarders advanced one car of Taicang wheat, the price being 9 yuan and 8 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Sales are Loosening</h3>
<p>Amidst the general price increases of commodities, the sharp rise in the prices of miscellaneous grains has been particularly rare. In the past two days, due to the instability of the world situation and the public's favorable expectations for China, speculative hoarding in the market has decreased, allowing the overall situation to stabilize somewhat, and offering prices have also turned downward. It is estimated that large, quick-processed Siping Street soybeans are priced at 14.5 yuan, Changzhou cowhide soybeans at 12.5 yuan, cowhide green beans at 12.6 yuan, Chongming sand red beans at 11.5 yuan, Chongming sand silkworm beans at 7.2 to 7.5 jiao, Jiading white skin silkworm beans at 8.78 yuan, Maojia City green skin silkworm beans at 9 yuan, Bengbu mung beans at 9.7 jiao, Huangdu new corn at 9.15 yuan, Hankou June white soybeans at 12.3 yuan, and Chongming green skin silkworm beans at 8.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Previously, 3,100 packages of beans were transported from the Northern Sands, and yesterday another 1,235 packages arrived.</p>
<p>The previous day, 1,930 pieces of raw oil arrived from Qingdao, along with another 1,323 cans.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: A Merchant Buys in the Market; Talk of Increased Taxes Gains Credence; All Sugars Jump by About Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors of increased sugar taxes resurfaced in the sugar market, and a merchant suddenly purchased more than 3,000 packages of crude white and carriage white sugar in the market. Judging from the merchant's actions, there may be some truth to the talk of increased taxes. It is possible that the market may rise again because of this. The guild's pricing for spot goods shows that No. 24 crude white sugar rose by 1.9 to 2 yuan, with the local firm at 40.9 yuan, the foreign firm at 40.6 yuan, and transshipment at 32.5 yuan. Taikoo carriage white sugar also rose by 1.6 to 1 yuan. West Firm's B Mark initially stood at 44.8 yuan, then slightly recovered to 44.5 yuan.

<p>Due to the scarcity of Water East branches arriving, the market situation is tight again. Yesterday, North-South goods stores all made offers, with high-quality goods offered at 65 yuan, a rebound of 2 to 3 yuan compared to the previous time. The asking price for Hainan New Yuan meat was slightly relaxed.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Sales Improve, Market Prices Rebound</h3>

The Yunnan group purchased more than 5,000 pieces of fine twill, colored cloth, colored twill, striped bleached cloth, serge, and khaki. The Guangdong group purchased more than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, foreign yarn, and printed serge. Buyers from overseas locations such as Singapore and Little Luzon purchased more than 4,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, Le cloth, and coarse cloth. Local merchants were also active. Hengfeng and Tongfeng printed velvet hand goods opened for sale at 0.315 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>It seems that there is hope for salvaging the European situation, and public sentiment has improved. The market has absorbed quite a bit. Dragon Head fine cloth first made a price of 18 yuan, an increase of 0.2 yuan from the previous day, and then continued to rise to 18.1 yuan. Other brands of fine cloth and twill also rebounded by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge and straight tribute also rebounded strongly. Yesterday, the market price was 0.54 to 0.545 yuan, an increase of 0.02 yuan per yard compared to the lowest price of the previous day. The local merchants and the Yangtze River group traded more than 600 pieces.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 25th, 20 pieces were shipped to Yantai and 15 pieces to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Hardware: White Lead Wire Market Improves</h3>
<p>The white lead wire, which has been quiet for a long time, is still sluggish in the market. Customer demand is lacking, and local merchants are rarely purchasing, resulting in a very cold market and sporadic transactions. However, due to the influence of overseas pricing, the market has improved by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan compared to before. Currently, No. 1 to No. 6 are sold for 25 yuan, No. 7 to No. 13 are sold for 30 yuan, and No. 14 and below, up to fine patterns, are priced at around 32 to 33 yuan.</p>

<h3>Shared Feelings of the Times</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Zhao Oubei has a very novel and interesting poem in his "On Poetry: Quatrains": "The poems of Li and Du are spread by millions of mouths, but even now they feel stale. Each era produces its own talented people, each leading the way for hundreds of years." This says that literature has its own temporality. No matter how amazing a writer's skills, how rich his emotions, and how cloudy his imagination, he will inevitably fall behind after a thousand years of sifting by time. This view recognizes the value of time, which alone can determine the value of a work, even if the tone may be a bit extreme, but the sharpness of the eye cannot be buried. Who says that time cannot weigh the true value of a literary work? Literary works reflect the times. This is an old saying and does not need to be repeated. We also know that a great literary work is great because it can grasp the core of the era and reveal its soul, making it immortal. Often, even after thousands of years, it is still a prophet of the times. In the end, it is not eliminated by the times. We know that while the times can eliminate writers, a good writer can also grasp the times.</p>
<p>What is the relationship between time and writers? The task of literature is to record emotions. A writer can win the sympathy of everyone, which can also be said to have completed his task. But this kind of empathy is not for a minority of people, let alone the kind of "looking up to a thousand years and shedding a tear." Empathy must be as Taine said: "Win the sympathy of the entire era, the entire nation," "express the entire era," and "the way of life of the entire nation."</p>
<p>Simply put, a healthy masterpiece is not for a few people to read. It speaks to the distress that everyone has. It is a "public instrument" for the people of the world, and everyone has the right to use and enjoy it. In terms of time, it captures the current reality and even prophesies the future. In terms of space, it is the most extensive plant in the world. Like the medieval knights depicted by Stendhal, the gray creeps of the Tsarist era in Gogol's "The Overcoat," the poems of Xia Zhi, and Joyce's novels, which tell us the subtle images of the Irish, these can all be said to have exhausted the capabilities of empathy. They leave behind the shadow of the times and write out the emotions shared by "all people."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that a great work must be able to reflect the times, but what cannot be ignored is that attention must also be paid to winning the empathy of the times. It is not enough to objectively write down the times. We must also give them sympathy. Especially in this era we are in, which is struggling and pregnant with hardship, there are many others who share our fate, many friends who are tearful or supportive of us. Naturally, it is necessary to write down the elegy of this era. How do we win the empathy of the times? I think there are three points.</p>
<p>First, we must transmit the system of our emotions. Taine said: "There is a system on top of human thoughts or emotions." This system is often driven by "a certain general characteristic of the spirit and mood of the people of a race, a century, or a country." Do not blindly imitate or imitate, diminishing yourself, but write down your emotions frankly and faithfully. Even if the appearance and form are different, people will still understand and sympathize with you. Remember, this emotion is "ours"! The emotion of the Chinese nation, composed of five ethnic groups, in the 20th century, when the light is about to rise.</p>
<p>Second, there must be collective intelligence. Literature is a public instrument for the people of the world, and a few people must not monopolize it for private ownership. There is no need to waste too much ink on the bored sorrow of one or two people. Although taste and depression are the wisdom of our creation, we must always remember: "Not only have our own intelligence, but also the wisdom of friends." Let us not forget Nietzsche's words: Experience the feelings of the masses more!</p>
<p>Third, justice must be the destination. Although times change, justice is always eternal. As long as you respect justice, the times will always be yours. No one will abandon you unless he abandons justice. We should always remember Romain Rolland's play "The Wolves." Isn't the protagonist in the play, Thierrye, the embodiment of justice? Who is not moved by him? Even after thousands of years, this unyielding general who died for the truth will always exist.</p>
<p>Let friends sympathize with and help us, and let the children know what kind of nightmare we have had. We should grasp the times, do these three basic things, and make our works become "documentary records" and "historical monuments."</p>
<h3>Troop Transfer</h3>
<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>——A Wartime Account of the Beijing-Shanghai Line——</p>
<p>It was dusk, and the boat was gradually rocking into the dark countryside. The winding river reflected a pale, white light. The banks of the river were full of tall reeds, emitting a hint of gunpowder.</p>
<p>The rain was getting heavier and heavier, and all our clothes were wet, sticking to our bodies and feeling uncomfortably cold. Comrades Fa, Xiang, and Fang put on a raincoat, like a small Boy Scout tent. Gang, Ping, and I held up a broken umbrella, but it barely covered our heads.</p>
<p>I don't know what time it was, it seems like such a long time after dusk, the boat stopped under the pier of a stone bridge. In the darkness, we examined and vaguely identified the outline of a market town.</p>
<p>"Hey! Boatman, where is this place?"</p>
<p>"Sir! We've arrived at Gelong Town!" he said, tying the boat to the dock.</p>
<p>The comrades were excited, thinking that we could find a place to warm up and dry off, so they jumped ashore.</p>
<p>We groped around the whole street in the darkness, but couldn't find a place where anyone lived. Only a few stray dogs without a home were wandering in the center of the street with their tails dragging.</p>
<p>With disappointed hearts, we returned to the boat. We were even colder, but no one complained.</p>
<p>Keep groping! The place to warm up must be nearby!</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to get excited and temporarily overcome the coldness of the rainy night, so:</p>
<p>"Forward march, don't retreat, life and death are here..." The entire boat burst into a majestic song. The singing resounded through the dark sky, and the boatman rowed even harder!</p>
<p>On another small river, the boatman dropped anchor again. Running ashore, the flashlight revealed a section of wall. We raised the light, and it was so tall, so big, a temple—Nanguang Temple.</p>
<p>The director and secretary ran into the temple first, and soon an elderly old monk greeted us.</p>
<p>Everything was arranged, and we all went to the kitchen first, filled the pot with water, lit the stove, and took off our clothes, drying them one by one.</p>
<p>An hour later, a large pot of rice porridge and four large plates of pickles were placed in the dining hall. The comrades sat around in a circle, sipping, laughing, and smiling.</p>
<p>After the director finished two bowls of porridge, he put down his chopsticks and began talking to the abbot, Xian Tao, who was sitting next to him: "How many monks are there in your temple?"</p>
<p>"More than twenty!" the abbot replied slowly, looking like he had a great worry.</p>
<p>"Are they all in the temple?"</p>
<p>"No, some have gone out, they're not here."</p>
<p>"Have they gone out to beg for alms?" The director probably thought he had troubled him a lot, and felt a little guilty, so I asked this unimportant question to break the abbot's silence.</p>
<p>"No, they have gone to the front lines!" The abbot took a sip of tea, his face flushed, as if he was a little excited.</p>
<p>"To the front lines?" We were unusually surprised and repeated the question.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What did they go there to do?" The director really wanted to know clearly. The comrades also stopped eating and drinking, staring at the abbot's face illuminated by the light.</p>
<p>"They went to join the ambulance team and went to the front lines to rescue the wounded soldiers," the abbot said, taking a breath. "We used to contribute very little to the country, but this time we can't let it go easily, so in our Buddhist community, there is also an ambulance team organization to help the country."</p>
<p>"That's hard work for them!" the director said with admiration.</p>
<p>"That's just doing a little bit of the responsibility of being a citizen! That's nothing compared to you."</p>
<p>"We eat the country's food, and we should contribute to the country! You are different!" the director said in his old tone again.</p>
<p>"We eat the food of the benefactors, shouldn't we contribute to the benefactors?" the abbot said with a laugh, as if joking, and a burst of laughter broke out in the hall.</p>
<p>Because we were too tired, we had to go to sleep and didn't hear the rest of their conversation.</p>
<h3>Breaking Through the Wall</h3>
<h3>Delusions</h3>
<p>— Gu Ding</p>
<p>Everyone has a delusion, a chimera hidden in their heart! A fierce lion, a wild ox, or a beautiful goddess can occupy a person's soul.</p>
<p>Everyone has a dream, right? Isn't the world in the dream just the leftover traces of delusion? After all, a person's two eyes are limited. Where can he find a vast world? A person's thoughts are naturally calm and tranquil in smooth seas, but if they touch a dangerous reef, there will be ruptures. Reefs of thought are scattered throughout the world. If you don't encounter them today, you may not encounter them tomorrow, but you can't say you won't encounter them the day after tomorrow. When the morning passes, an evil thorn will grow in the evening. Delusion can blossom beautiful flowers, but it can also bear poisonous fruits.</p>
<p>What nourishes delusion is life, is the sentient beings of the world. But delusion also nourishes life.</p>
<p>Suppose a pair of expensive wolfhounds are wearing collars around their necks, muzzles over their mouths, and a leash, being led by someone. They will be smug. If you ask them, "Dog, where are you going?" They shake their heads; they don't know where they are going; but they know to move forward.</p>
<p>Delusion is sometimes like the leash on a dog's head, it will pull a person along. If you ask him, "Person, where are you going?" He also shakes his head.</p>
<p>But delusion is not all about controlling people, sometimes it is also controlled by people.</p>
<p>For example, the Earth is round. Wasn't that an absurd delusion three thousand years ago? The discovery of hundreds of philosophies, the manufacture of hundreds of items, were all just delusions beforehand, at most a chaotic dream. However, when delusion is grasped and utilized, it is the mother of success.</p>
<p>Not only grasped and utilized, but even delusion can be manufactured. One person's delusion, two people's delusion, is just delusion. But "three people with one heart, together will cut metal." If three or more people have the same goal, the same direction, the same delusion, they may be able to "cut metal." However, no matter what the matter, the first priority is still to clarify right and wrong. We must lead delusion, not be led by delusion. Because there are too many liquids that look like clean water, besides clean water, there is also intoxicating wine and murderous poison.</p>
<p>"Everyone has their own chimera!" The French poet Baudelaire said this long ago.</p>

<h3>An Exploration of Yan Jupeng's Singing Technique</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>In the summer of June in the 28th year of the Republic of China [1939], Yan Jupeng was invited to Shanghai and performed at the Golden Theatre, the first night was the *Empty City Stratagem* and *The Beheading of Ma Su*, and the Kun role Hou Yulan performed *Yutang Chun*. It was unprecedentedly grand. I was lucky to have a reserved ticket and was able to see it. The next day I heard his *Hongyang Cave*. Both are very famous plays of the Tan School. Jupeng had certainly put in a lot of hard work. Now, because his voice and strength were insufficient, he did not hesitate to abandon his studies and transform them. His situation is pitiful and his actions are dangerous. It is for this reason that I cannot but educate him. Now Jupeng's merits are fulfilled and he has returned north. Now I can speak of it without hindering his business, and I hope Jupeng will take good care of his spirit, change his ways, and prepare for a comeback. Then I can tell my fellow students that I am innocent, and I have lived up to what I have learned and fulfilled my responsibilities. What else could there be?</p>
<p>There are two points in Jupeng's singing that must be deleted and revised: 1. "Unevenness in tempo, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. In the *Empty City Stratagem*, the one or two nations are fighting like dragons and tigers..." and "I am originally from Wolonggang..." on the city tower, and in *Hongyang Cave* "For the country..." and "Since that day..." All of these have fixed tempos. The so-called fixed tempo means that the speed must be uniform. Except for the last sentence when the tempo changes or someone else sings, it can be "gradually slowed down", but it is absolutely impossible to extend it arbitrarily in the middle. Moreover, the two verses "I am originally..." and "Since that day..." are well-known, and there are recordings to prove it. How can they be arbitrarily changed? Now Jupeng's singing is sometimes fast and sometimes slow, with no "tempo" to be found, like malaria, sometimes hot and sometimes cold, making the human body painful and unbearable. The uneven speed and unstable rhythm of the singing are also the same. If people's auditory nerves have no pleasure, then few are willing to pay the price to buy spiritual food. For the sake of Jupeng's future, this point must be improved. The method of "slowing down" can only be used occasionally in a song. If the branches and knots are all arbitrarily fast and slow, it is too much. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<p>Random Notes on Performers</p>
<h3>Ms. Gu Meijun, a Silver Star, Talks About: Fragments of Memories (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Leng Fang</p>
<p>(Editor's Introduction) Gu Meijun was originally a top student at the Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School. She has been in the film industry for nearly ten years and has acted in no less than thirty films. Such dramas as *Lively Dragon and Tiger*, *Diamond*, and *Salt Tide* are all wonderful and well-known works. She is also good at performing Peking opera, both singing and acting, and has many excellent dramas. She is versatile and deserves to be admired for her unique advantages.</p>
<p>I have been in the film industry for nearly ten years, and I ask myself if I have spent my years in vain. I have nothing good to say. I have always been mediocre, and I can't talk about any achievements. Besides feeling ashamed, I am even more frustrated by my weak health, which has prevented me from striving for progress in art. I deeply resent myself for this.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the situation when I first entered the film industry, this is the most memorable scene in my personal artistic life. Originally, I was deeply infatuated with drama and film. I remember that when I was sixteen years old and still studying at the Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School and had not yet graduated, a neighbor invited me to the Star Company to learn Peking opera. Because the Star actors at that time had just formed a "Star Opera Troupe" like the box office, as long as a good friend introduced you, you could join the troupe to learn opera. Therefore, my sisters and I went to learn opera together every night. After more than a year, the Star Company decided to put me on stage to sing, praising my good performance and thinking that I had a talent for acting. This is how they offered me a long three-year contract, giving me, a film fan, the opportunity to devote myself to the screen.</p>
<h3>A Small Portrait of Meijun</h3>
<h3>Hollywood's Temptress - Ann Sheridan - Acclaimed as America's "Oomph" Girl</h3>
<p>— Di</p>
<p>Following Clara Bow and Jean Harlow, the silver screen in Hollywood has produced another dazzling temptress this year. The American film industry and social figures are enthusiastically promoting her, calling her the "Oomph" Girl. She is the sexy movie star Ann Sheridan.</p>
<p>Of course, she was able to become famous because of her good environment. Her original name was Clara L. Sheridan. She is only 24 years old this year. She was born in Dallas on February 21, 1915, received higher education, and liked outdoor activities. Later, after leaving school, she met Walter Wanger, a producer at Warner Bros., who had single-handedly turned Clara Bow into a Hollywood star. Now he found that Ann Sheridan also had the same beauty and charm, so he began to promote her as America's "Oomph Girl"!</p>
<p>She has a naturally beautiful physique, full curves, and long auburn hair, half-covering her pair of charming big eyes. Her posture when walking is soul-stirring, and her low and rough voice is as intoxicating as a murmur. Such a beautiful creature, coupled with the training and influence of famous directors, no wonder she is so popular, causing a sensation among movie fans all over the United States!</p>
<p>Usually, when she is free from work, she often goes to major nightclubs with Cesar Romero, a famous Rhumba dance expert in Hollywood. Although she personally has a significant other, Dr. Charles Taylor, a specialist in difficult diseases in Los Angeles, of course the film company absolutely does not want her to marry him. So far, who is qualified to marry this passionate "Oomph" Girl is still a question! Hollywood's male stars such as Clark Gable, Robert Taylor, and Tyrone Power have all been eliminated, so she must wait for the Warner Brothers to discover another "Oomph" boy before they can be called a talented man and a beautiful woman, a match made in heaven!</p>
<p>Although she often shows off her style and performs excitingly on the screen, she is usually gentle and generous. Especially in nightclubs, she always sits quietly, with her charming eyes half-open and half-closed, leaning back on the chair, rarely saying a word. Her calm and dignified attitude is unimaginable that she is the sexy girl on the silver screen!</p>
<p>When Warner Bros.' new film *Winter Carnival* was screened, she was a great success in it. So this day can also be regarded as the anniversary of her being hailed as the "Oomph" Girl - that day of March 16, 1939.</p>

<h3>Star Six Star Chronicle Eight - ? (Continued)</h3>
<p>"There's nothing I can do. Besides, Eighth Brother knows my situation. In front of your cousin, I still have to pretend. Sigh, it's really hard to be a human being. I should see through things." The woman also had unspeakable difficulties, but still consoled the man.</p>
<p>The tram station arrived. "What do you want to do, take the tram or walk?"</p>
<p>"If you ask me, it's also refreshing to walk."</p>
<p>The two walked in silence. "The destination is almost here. You should separate from me earlier, lest people see it and laugh at me. It's not too late for you to go see a 9 o'clock movie now," she said, grasping his hand tightly, lowering her head, turning and walking north.</p>
<p>"Then you have to come back earlier, don't make me wait too long," the man said, chasing after her.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I definitely don't want to make you wait long. It's not that I don't want to stay with you day and night, but fate makes my heart even more sad than yours. My love, go see a movie and relax, but never go to other dance halls to dance with other dancers. If you want to see a movie, go quickly."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I will definitely go home, so you don't have to worry."</p>
<p>The two separated and went to the places they wanted to go. On the quiet road, the voices of this young couple disappeared in an instant."</p>
<p>Miss ?, who is this story written for? I'm sorry I didn't revise it well. If I have the opportunity, I'll revise and publish your second masterpiece.</p>
