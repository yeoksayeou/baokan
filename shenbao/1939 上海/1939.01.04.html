<p>社評</p>
<h3>答客問　——汪精衛事——</h3>
<p>汪精衛事，本報旣一再痛斥其在妄，各方允同深憤慨於其悖謬；偶或有爲彼身世惜者，顧莫或爲稍予同情。近代哲學學說繁興，世人論人論事，輒歎息於道德無標準，理論無定律；其實大是大非之殊，極善極惡之分，則必以人同此心，心同此理，成爲不可磨滅之公道；輿情反應之速，判斷之嚴，絲毫無假借餘地；猶黑白之一望而知，無待思而後知；薰蕕之一觸而辨，無待審而後辨也。此决在精衛之言動，爲舉世唾棄，而其自趨坵墓，幾可作蓋棺論定之觀，更不必復論矣；乃有客質記者以數問，饒有意味，爲述如次。</p>
<p>客曰：衆口一辭於在精衛之悖謬在妄，是在熱情抗戰之中，自應若此反應；然事屬常識所不爲，詎彼曾常人之不若？容或別有高深，値得我儕虛心研討者乎？彼在中樞，見聞較民間爲切。容或窺知抗戰軍事之何種弱點，始先降以自全乎？久稱黨國元老，小組夙有根盤，容或羽毛漸豐，旣得舉足重輕，對宗邦有所挾持，對敵國有可爲贄者乎？精誠團結，自此分裂，抗戰力量不將稍稍削弱乎？在精衛究非至愚，非有幾分把握，何至貿然冒此天下之大不韙乎？凡此所問，本報前論所未及也。請一言之：</p>
<p>在精衛此决言動頗可與一九三六年十二月間之西安事變相提並論。蓋違反公意，倒行逆施；表面奇特之極，不在常情常理之中；不度德，不量力，爲領袖慾所衝動驅使：妄想號召有衆，卒爲萬衆共棄之獨夫：發之以儼然莫測高深之姿態，終於暴露其瘋在心理；此數端，實質上與西安事變盡同；在西安事變之當時，羣以爲奧妙而惡辣同，及事後剖析，知者爲之失笑；此决在精衛之成就，祗成就爲天下後世所笑之資料而已。在之爲人，極褊狹，對人對事，執持成見，不能容物；隱然自命爲天才，故於政治旣露頭角之後，學問絕無進步；根本上非高人，而又聰明自蔽，故祗有常識不足之可能，而無孕育高深見解之機會。試取彼前後所非難之焦土戰與遊擊戰諸論，可證彼成見之深，不能再長進；更試讀蔣委員長二十六日之訓與在精衛二十九日之電文，可知在電無研討價値。至於中國之軍事，夙由蔣委員長統盤運籌；參預部分軍事者亦僅得知部分之實况，不參預軍事者，一無所知；良以軍事逈殊於政治，政治尚公開，尚坦白，可以見微知著，而軍事不以虛虛實實爲不道德，而以絕對機密爲成功之條件。今主持軍事者對抗戰旣有制勝之自信，則任何人即無吾認此項自信之資格。旣無所知，復無資格，顧猶仰首伸眉，一似行將「出賣風雲雷雨」者，此豈有何眞知灼見，徒見其首鼠兩端而已。至於若干派系小組之存在。當係事實；然夙以黨稱者，以主義著者，猶爲抗戰而歸於國民黨三民主義之大纛之下，則此外所謂派系小組，必無利國福民之意義可言；允以近數年來，蔣委員長之精誠感格，有爲之士，皆知獻身國家，服從領袖，故往日之派系小組，漸决消弭，軍界允然。以在精衛性格之褊狹，學識之不長進，十數年來之屢屢反覆，早已不爲才識者所信服，更遑論羣衆；若爲祿位而追隨之者，自有其人，然碌碌者若干輩，一無可稱，一無力量；謂得舉足重輕。非妄自尊大之自欺，即招搖撞騙之欺人而已。重慶旋有開除黨籍之决議，東京尚無羅致貳臣之表示，是則在精衛雖極自負，雖求自全，而其客觀之估價固甚輕微；其叛焉，於中國抗戰力量何損乎？然則在精衛豈非至愚？曰，彼以爲廿九日之電文，將有中國人民奉爲國族領袖，將有南北傀儡迎爲元首，將有日本朝野尊爲友邦代表，將有德義英法譽爲和平之神；夫非偉大之想像歟？幻夢一鳴以驚人，非貿然也；乃爲「潮濕之爆竹」豈始料哉！</p>

<h3>腎臟之衰弱症是</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫　科畢業楊道南著</p>
<p>家庭和平的破壞者</p>
<p>你要組織圓滿的家庭嗎？生育健康的子孫嗎？夫婦偕老終身嗎？第一個條件，就是不可不注意雙方的身心之康健：如其在結婚之前，雙方的家系之健康狀態，不經過縝密的調查，共後夫婦之任何一方，發生健康上的障碍，一定難免造成種種的悲劇，——那夫婦間最不幸的離婚，原因雖然很複雜，可是，其中尤其惹起吾人注意的即是夫婦間的腎臟神經衰弱症；他倆的愛情，縱然如何的熱烈，然而一經發生本症，愛情自然會冷却的，家庭的和平自然會破裂的。不但如此，就是夫婦間都是健康的，——腎臟的能力幷沒有什麽異常，而不能充分獲到天賦的愉快，其結果固然談不到生育健全的後繼者；這種家庭，充滿着陰鬱，沉寂的氣象，也就是人生的無上苦境了！</p>
<p>因此吾人欲謀家庭的幸福，人生的愉快，對於本症的爆發一定要充分注意，夫婦之一方或雙方，如果腎臟的能力發生障碍，趕緊要從醫藥的知識上去矯正他，那末這性的知識是任何人也少不了的了。</p>
<p>結婚後的腎臟機能障碍，大槪可分爲病的關係與年齡及夫婦生活的倦怠等三種。所說的病的關係；純由婚前自慰過度，及荒淫縱慾，致罹發育不全，腎萎等病。次爲由年齡而來的性障碍，以中年丈夫爲最多，因主宰腎臟的靑春腺隨年歲的增高而漸漸減低活力，故中年後的男子對夫婦的興趣與熱力，較靑年人爲薄弱，如於少壯時貪色縱慾，則中年後竟喪失此種天賦的機能。至於夫婦生活的倦念，每因雙方意見不合，或嫌對方姿容低劣所造成，故此以喜新懨舊愛情不專一的靑年爲最多。而夫婦共悶生活的最大幸福與愉快自亦不克充分享受了！</p>
<p>綜上所述，促成婚後腎臟障碍的原因綦多，然最普遍者，首推病理的原因爲最多，故治療方法，以增精補血爲第一要策，可惜市上製劑都以治療性神經衰弱症爲號召，其撰擇取捨，使病家與醫師都感迷惑，尤其强精劑中的成分，多爲一時的興舊劑，使用之後，流弊百出，故不思安全根治則已，若要求一勞永逸，須選眞正雄壯動物睪丸精質製劑，能生奇偉效果，余最愛用德國「補體康」，本劑完全採取猩猩，牛羊動物之靑春腺素，並滲入補腦，補血的礦植物成分，故效果最佳。確爲腎萎者的一大救星！</p>
<h3>遺精需要速治速止！</h3>
<p>— 德國醫　學博士　鄭霆</p>
<p>各種病症，皆有其因，有因成果，而病象旣著，往往倒果成因，如遺精則腎虧。而腎虧者，其精愈不能的束，遺洩日頻，由腎虧而致神經衰弱者，因神經衰弱，而相火偏旺，慾念難控，遺精頻繁，甚至稍一衝動，即感滑精者。本症的治療，第一須止其遺精，故應從鞏固精關着手。如德國性病專家耐而斯氏所發明之「耐而斯遺精片」爲根治遺精的特效藥。並再服以「補體康」以培補虧損，消滅神經衰弱症，則不論任何衰弱各症，如風掃落葉，頃刻消滅。講到「耐而斯遺精片」一藥之功效，余屢試之下，確爲他種製劑所不及。</p>
<p>現代醫學</p>
<h3>鐵一般的事實　試騐管中之淋藥實騐</h3>
<p>— 美國醫　學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>許多舊時之淋病療法，旣經現代專家醫師，及病家證明其無效，故新療法之研究，甚囂於整個醫學界中，學者埋頭工作，耗盡無數心血與腦汁，卒由試騐管中，發見一治淋眞理，而一時震撼全世界的醫壇。咸認爲治療淋病上最大之收穫。時余方負笈美利堅攻讀醫學，銳意硏究，博覽歐美各國所出版之醫學雜誌，乃知係根據最新科學之新方法，將提製純凈之色素與蛋白體，侶以共他溫文而具强力殺菌之化學藥品，製爲溶液，取以浸染淋菌，則見淋菌迅卽死亡。</p>
<p>有許多學者如Jauregg（1912）R。Rrans（1914．1917）R．Schmidt（1916）諸博士，皆身爲大學敎授，成淋病專科醫師，亦均迭决試騐該劑，證明效力宏偉，蓋試騐管中斜面培養基之淋菌平時極爲活躍而生動，若一經注入此藥液於該試騐管中，即頓見淋菌全部死滅，其後彼德博士，於百尺竿頭，更進一步，乃取純凈黃色素及特製蛋白體等，用精密之消毒手續，製爲內服劑「克淋儂」從此淋病之治療遂開一新天地</p>
<p>凡是男女急慢性中之淋病，如男子之急慢性龜頭炎，攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，膀胱炎，關節炎，女子之陰門炎，陰道炎，子宮炎，卵巢炎，淋毒性白帶等，本藥均有根治之功能。其成效之迅速與正確，久已口碑載道，若女子淋毒性白帶，可一方外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，每晚於臨睡前取一片插入將道，次晨洗去卽得。男子可外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明書洗滌尿道，在家秘密自療，則見效之速，允能出人意表。較之在一般醫生處治療，有過之無不及。此余十數年來臨床經騐所得之結論也。（按「抗淋水」中西太和大藥房均有經售）</p>
<h3>肺病立愈說</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>今日肺病之療法，　歐洲各國，均盛行肺部弛緩療法。據專家之報吿，內服「神肺拿爾」後，確能實現上述的目的，蓋此藥配製之根據，卽採用此規也。故服後三小時側使肺部弛緩，收縮空洞，因之療菌卽失去活動範圍，相繼死滅。故無論何期肺病，雖屆最後關頭。「補肺拿爾」之藥力，側使食慾亢進，呼吸暢利，咳嗽潮熱與盜汗，均消滅無形矣。</p>
<h3>淋病義馬座</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路　九號四川路口　急性淋症狀消失後之療法</p>
<p>淋病如能及早治療，以免長期在困難而苦惱之生活中，但不幸萬一因淋病在早期（急性期）失治，將成慢性淋之際，如能將正式醫師予以適常之治療，則猶爲淋病患者不幸之幸成也。惟最忌者，以爲此病已將成慢性，遂自暴而自棄，不肯作切實之醫治，結果，終必成爲慢性淋以爲一生之累也，可不及早而圖之乎？</p>
<p>所謂急性淋病症狀消失後之療法者，卽淋病在急性症狀漸次消失後，而施以適當療法，以免轉入慢性淋是也，凡患急性淋之第二三週後，所有念性症狀，如疼痛性之漸次消失，分泌物與炎症之漸决輕快，其時患者，僅早起時在尿道口，見有濃厚之膿分泌物而已。</p>
<p>在此時期，宜用增加濃度之Protargolum，隨後改用德國靜電療法，及內服淋病聚藥「克淋儂」，使病家細胞發生抗淋噬菌作用，而同時使此等療法後，因藥力發揮殺菌的作用，必有一决膿汁分泌，但此爲醫治淋病上必要之條件。余醫治此症時，皆預先向患者說明，故施用時，病人亦不以爲怪也。如住北西藏路聶一嗚君。其先本患急性淋，以調治未能如法，故未獲徹底治愈。乞余治療，余施用上述諸藥與療法後，並說明藥後之情形，彼欣然從命，至第二星期後，改用「抗淋水」，以期殺滅淋菌而呈消炎之作用，使上皮組胞之冉生，醫治的三星期，放尿瑩潔，其他一切症狀俱已徹底根治，診時上午十時至下午六時自卽日起每天送診二十號，每號僅收號金五角</p>
<h3>日本發生閣潮　近衛準備下台　平沼繼起組閣呼聲最高　末次政治動員計劃碰壁</h3>
<p>（東京）據此間消息靈通方面之意見、日相近衛因年底多决會議之結果、已决定於本週內呈遞內閣辭職書、樞密院長平沼騏一郞男爵、最有繼任首相之望、聞閣潮原因、起於內相末决根據政治全國動員之主張、末决乃以有法西斯傾向著聞者、其所擬之計劃如果採行、則各政黨將併成一黨、政友與民政兩黨雖贊成全國精神上總動員、但竭力反對末决之計劃、聞末决揚言將强迫解散國會、果爾則尋常預算案與中日事件六十萬萬元預算案、未爲國會通過、勢將造成日本戰時金融之大紊亂、因是理由、近衛寗願於一月二十四日國會重開以前自請辭職、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（香港）東京電、日內閣定明日舉行本年之第一次會議、據此間觀察家稱、日本充實內閣之計劃、將於一二日內實現、（三日電）</p>
<p>（東京）據消息靈通人士稱、近數日內此間政府要人互相徵詢、頗形忙碌、本星期將賡續進行、雖無明定事實、洩露於外、但衆信必與行將改組內閣一事有關、聞於本月十日前當有必要之决定、參與此項會商者、除國防各部首腦外、尙有藏相池田。及敎育大臣。厚生省大臣等、惟內相末决則並未參與、據觀察家宮、數日前樞密院議長會與掌壐大臣作數度會談、掌要大臣代表日皇及首相近衛文磨及其他閣員、與之進行談話、政界人士鄭重申言、此决改組內閣之維一目的、乃在取得各閣員問密切連絡與統一意志云、（三日海通電）</p>
<h3>日本軍事費　支出浩大　小企業紛紛停閉　國內失業者激增</h3>
<p>（東京）據日本各報消息、下屆財政年度之特　別預算、連同對華戰費在內、大的超過本屆之數、將等於英金五千九百萬鎊、按新預算之總額、等於英金三萬五千三百萬鎊、上年度則爲　二萬九千四百萬鎊、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）一九三九年度、日本勞動大衆之生活將更困苦、蓋以該國統治階級堅持繼續在華之延久戰爭也、此戰爭已使日本之經濟、遭受重大打擊、企業因之而停閉者不下數萬處、失業人數已增至二百萬人之衆、捐稅已增至四萬萬元、各項必需品如紡織物。香烟。茶。咖啡。及肥皂等、均被抽微重稅、一九三九年度日本勞動大衆、須負担侵華軍費六萬萬元、同時須大量减縮其用品之消費、（三日快訊社電）</p>
<h3>中國抗戰　圑結益固　對遠東時局　英報抱樂觀</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日此間各報對於遠東時局、抱更大樂覜、金融泰晤士報社論謂美國對日態度之日趨堅强、與採辦貨物信用款之給予、愈使一般在華金融上與商業上利益現受危害者、有美政府終將採取更强硬的立塲之希望、美國信用放款繼英國借款而起、雖其數不大、然就中國人民抗戰精神之觀念點而言、則殊關重要、苟無此種援助則汪精衛對日媾和之主張將愈有力矣、惟時局變化不定、戰爭猶在進行中、故英美兩國之援助宜速、爲保持中政府與門戶開放政策之主要因素、凡其利益受影饗者、不可不愼重考慮此種地位、允宜出以迅速之動作云、伯明罕郵報稱據所得情報、日人認在精衛之叛離爲中國團結力崩潰之起點、此直日人片面之想像耳、其實汪精衛之脫離、愈可强固政府之團結、中國抗戰精神亦未有因在之通電而受影饗之表徵、據觀察家最近所得之印象、中國抗戰决心且因英美方面經濟上之援助、而更形堅决矣云、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>德報批評　國際時局　遠東歐洲　相提並論</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國各報在新正所評論之主要問題、共有兩項、一爲地中海問題、一爲遠東爭端、「柏林日報」則以西班牙內戰與遠東爭端相提並論、略謂「各方面均望西班牙問題能以早日結束、英國首相張伯倫本月中旬前往羅馬與義當局進行談話時、即當以此問題爲談話起點、至以遠東而論、日本方面自本年乃係「外交年」證以汪精衛與土肥原開始進行談判之說、自覺信而有徵」、至此、該報又謂、「猶太的資本主義與鮑爾希維克革命、同在世界進行陰謀」、此乃世界第一危機、歐洲各國民族業已覺醒、即遠東方面亦有覺醒之勢、母勞西方各國予以指示、反之、美洲黑暗勢力、乃欲以紐的自由神手中之火把燃起全世界燎原之禍云、（三日啥瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>電動計算法與電動計算機</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>上古計算之法，為結繩記事厥後羅馬發明算盤，遂得有形之計算法，此為計算界成功之第一步，東方各國，至今仍多延用之者，至十七世紀末葉，有巴司克計算器之產生，藉機械之力，為數字上之計算與整理，效力，自較算盤敏捷，且可免去錯誤，更可節省腦力，此為計算界成功之第二步，此類計算機之應用，對於小規模之調查統計，用途甚廣，即目前吾國銀行機商及百貨公司等仍通用之，至於較大規模之調查統計，以時間上之拘束，與工作之繁重則尚感不足焉有，十九世紀初葉，亦即計算界成功第三步之開端，此步成功，使整個計算問題，有空前之發展，是則尤足稱述者也，蓋有形之計算法，尚需運用悟性敏捷，始克成事，此步改革，並不注重有形，而將全部手續，出機器自動計算，此即統計專家哈羅苪博博士所發明電動計算法之基本也，本項原理，屢加改革，其中佼佼者，如白倍其氏，如霍倫利氏，經數十年之改良，其效能及應用之範圍與日俱增，蓋大宗資料，皆能於極迅速之時間內獲得最準確之效果，是以此昔日少數統計家所驚為奇珍之機械，已進而為今日工商，行政，教育各機關為發展業務嚴密管理而編製各種詳盡報告之利器矣，</p>
<p>一，電動計算法之原理及運用</p>
<p>電動計算法之原理，即以各種資料，先用打孔法打孔於特製之卡片上，使機器因接觸卡片上所打之孔，藉電流之斷續而發生作用，猶如盲者誦讀書籍，藉凸版文字以資辯別，然當目睹電動機工作時，電機一開，各機自動開始工作，卡片盒內各種資料項目，如雪片粉飛，計算整理，瞬息而得，其工作之速度與準確，每令人驚訝而信此種繁複之機械，即根據上項淺顯之原理而產生者，</p>
<p>電動計算法之運用，通常經過下列各種步驟：</p>
<p>甲，編號數　將各種資料，分門別類，編成號數，即人名地名等文字，均以數字代表之，如海關出入口貿易統計，各種貨品名稱及地名號數均編印專本，全為整理此項調查統計目的之用，編號數之職務即將各種資料項目一一編成特殊號數，以代表之，號數編妥後即依照號數，打孔於卡片上，此種卡片，係經精密特製者，其厚薄重量務須均勻一律，方能與機器內部　造相符合也，</p>
<p>乙，登記　將所有資料編成號數後，再將號數打孔於卡片上，該項號數之排置，皆有一定行列，每一行列代表一種項目，電動計算機用卡片行數最多者達八十橫行，每行有打孔之位置十二，計自〇一到十二，完全打滿，可打九百六十孔，故任何複雜材料，此卡片均足以代表之，最新之方法，即各種資料之未便用數字代表者，亦可用英文複用打孔機，將資料打成英文字母及數字，無論編用號碼則所製成之報告亦可兼由文字與數字印出，</p>
<p>丙，校對　打孔後之卡片是否準確無訛，尚須加以校對，即打孔員將該項卡片裝入校對機，將原有資料複打一次，每捺一鍵，若與以前所打之孔合符，機器將卡片推動一行，如卡片不向前進，則表明原打卡片，已有錯誤，而須重打矣，</p>
<p>丁，分類　打孔完成以後，通常卡片之秩序必極紊亂，故須用計數分類機按作應根據之某項資料順序排列，其速率為每分鍾可分卡片四百張，</p>
<p>戊，製表　電動計算法之最終目的，乃為自動將資料編製印成報告，此步工作，必須運用計算印數機，蓋此機係一複式加減分類及印數機器，將已打孔之卡片置入此機，能使加數器及印刷器先後發生作用，此機且能適應任何報告格式之變動機器，復完全自動，一面印刷報告，一面可將撮數目自動另一卡片打出其功用之美備，無與倫比，</p>
<p>二，電動計算法之利益</p>
<p>電動計算法之利益甚多，茲大概歸納為四點，曰迅速，曰準確，曰適應，曰簡易，</p>
<p>迅速　普通登記之方法，不外手登及用打字機打字二種，手登方法，現代各種登記事項，都已廢除，至於最敏捷之打字員，每分鍾祗能打字母二百四十個，若應用電動計算法之打孔登記，大致每分鍾可打五百孔左右，由是觀之，用電動計算機登記，其速率較打字機多百分之五十，且機器能自動複製卡片，複製愈多，此百分率愈見增大，電動計算法分類工作之驚人速率，全世界殆無出其右，此已為人類公認之事實，據實騐之結果，電動計算機之加法，與加數機之效力，約為一與七十二之比，至於乘積，則電動機與倍數機相較，亦快二倍之上同，電動計算法之最動人之處，即大部工作皆出自動，故卡片打孔以後職工即可將翻譯機分類機計算機一一使之工作，當機器自動工作時，職工又可擔任別種工作矣，</p>
<p>準確　電動計算法之第二點利益為準確，且為百分之百之準確，蓋於卡片打孔之後，經過核對，證明無誤，則以後根據該項卡片所作之計算，及所製之報告，亦必毫無錯誤，而以此種始終不變之卡片充登記，選擇分類計算等等之工作之媒介物，其準確自不待言也，其他各種計算法之普通弱點，即欲求借貸二方平衡時，必費極大之金錢與時間，欲避免此種人工之普遍錯誤，則非利賴電動計算法不可，</p>
<p>適應　電運計算法之適應性極大，已經打孔之卡片如未打滿，欲添加資料時，僅費極少之時間與最廉之代價仍可在卡片上另加若干組，卡片之面積極小，貯藏極易，而將來或竟成為極貴重之資料，如特殊分析比較報告政府需索之各種消息等，皆可於打孔卡上查得，機器一套能經理工作多種，故打孔登記法，能使一切工作集中一處，而使用機關如欲修改體制或變更方式者，祗需將卡片之表格修改，或製表機上之電插板重插，即得，各種事業之主管人員，常因特殊需要，喜將大總數先行結出，然後再結束一次，俾經理處得以此作成財務報告，會計及統計人員每感此種手續之重複，如採用電動計算法，則不受次序之限制，而能供任何次序之報告</p>
<p>簡易　電動計算法下所利用之人力工作祗在打孔及校對打孔，而打孔手續之簡易，無論何人皆可學習之，且此種打孔員，對於商業不必定有若何經騐，即可學打任何種類賬卡，蓋此種賑卡已經公認為運用自動機器之媒介物，除打孔工作之外，其後製表手續盡歸機器自動，</p>
<p>三，電動計算機之介紹</p>
<p>十年前電動計算機之全部設備，祗包括打孔機分類機計算機三架，此三架基本機器所能處理之工作實不完全，至計算工作前後之種種工作，往往須藉人手為之，現在最完備效力最佳之電動機，首推萬國機器公司出品，茲擇其犖犖大者略予介紹如次，</p>
<p>（一）打孔機及電動打孔機</p>
<p>顧名思義該機專為打孔之用，功用自以後者為佳，平均速率每秒鍾可打五孔，</p>
<p>（二）校對機　專為校對之用，將已打孔之卡片置於此機上復打一次，如原打卡片有錯誤時，該機於撳時即不能前進，校對簡便敏捷，亦有機械式校對機，與電動校對機之別，</p>
<p>（三）自動翻譯機　將卡片上已打之孔任何四十五行或一部份資料一一譯出，印於卡上，則核對，歸檔，選擇，參考等工作，可更簡易，迅速，</p>
<p>（四）自動羣打機　有時眾多卡片，必須全部或局部同樣打孔，羣打機之功用，即在趕製此種工作，</p>
<p>（五）英文打孔機　此機能將英文字母及數字打於卡上，然後可由英文計算印數機將其印成英文名字文字及數字，</p>
<p>（六）電動分類機　此機能自動將一切卡片分成類別，同時將每類卡片按照任何次序順序排列，並能將某類卡片全部選出，而不紊亂他類卡片原有之順序，本機裝置卡片選擇器後，更能於一疊卡片中選出某類特需號數，而不紊亂卡片原來順序，</p>
<p>（七）自動信數機　此機能自動將表例卡片上所打之數組數字相乘，並於乘積時同時另減，將積數和數及差數，自動打於本卡指定之地位</p>
<p>（八）計算印數機及自動撮要機　計算印數機為一複式加減分類及印數機器，能據表例卡片自動印成一完全之報告，其速率為每分鍾一百五十張，並能印出數別細目分項數總數及差數，本機如裝置自動撮要機後，在計算印數製表時，即將撮要數目或差數同時另一卡片打出，增進印數效力，節省打孔時間，</p>
<p>英文計算印數機　此機能運用完成打孔卡片，將報告上印出英文字母，蓋除計算印數機之工作效力外，且得英文字母之輔助也，</p>
<p>（九）卡片位置選擇器　位置選擇，在一切印刷機器上佔一重要地位，因此器可使電動計算機之適應性增大，將表例卡片上已打之孔印成報告時，此器能將一組內不同之資料，自動分類，在報告上分印，反之此器亦能將卡片上打於各組內相同之資料，由各組選出，在報告上印成一總數，故本器可自由將同組內某種資料，加入報告，又能自由將同組之某種資料，由報告上刪去，</p>
<p>（十）計算分類機　有時工作緊急，必須設法將計算及分類二種工作，同時進行，此機即足完成此項目的，如衹做一種工作，亦無不可，</p>
<p>（十一）自動複打機　此機在複打或羣打資料相同之卡片上全部或局部數字或英文字母資料，可照任何次序複打或羣打或同時並進，</p>
<p>（十二）電動複製打孔機　此機除電動打孔機之功用外，復可用以複打整張卡片或若干片上相同之某組紀錄，原片打孔時固需賴手指動作，其後複製第二片之動作，則全由機器自動矣，</p>
<p>（十三）自動支票翻譯機　此機具有三種作用，甲，支票填製機乙，支票保護器丙，表例卡片翻譯機此三種作用可以隨時交互應用，</p>
<p>（十四）萬國複打機　此機具有二重作用，即可複打亦可羣打卡片，欲將任何一組卡片之一部或全部複製，均可採用此機，各片資料均可另易地位，羣打於細數卡上，且複打與羣打可同時工作，蓋根據原片複打一組卡片之時，可即將應加打之各組羣打也，</p>
<p>綜觀以上各機，足見歐西各國對予電動計算法研究之苦心，其精密謹慎之程度，洵足令人敬佩，吾人於應用之餘，得勿愧然，去蕪存　發揚而光大之，又豈非新中國國民之責任歟，</p>

<h3>法租界的市政組織</h3>
<p>— 黍甘</p>
<p>法租界於淸道光二十九年三月十四日（一八四九年四月六日）創立後，過了八年，淸咸豐七年二月十年十一月初七日（一八五七年十二月二十二日）纔正式成立巡捕房，至於市政機關的公董局，進至淸同治元年四月初三日（一八六三年五月一日）方纔成立。</p>
<p>公董局的董事會，最初是由法國駐滬總領事委任的，後來改爲選任制，到民國十六年後又改爲委任制。從此，法租界選任的董事會便吿中斷，而代之以委，年有更動而已。</p>
<p>公董局董事會分設：工務，財政，敎育，醫生救濟，交通園藝，地產，整正房捐，醫院管理等九個委員會。組織雖屬繁多，但不過是代表民意的機關，更實際些說，祇是法總領事的諮詢機關，所有一切界內的行政權，警務權，以及公務人員的任免，全屬法總領事的。</p>
<p>至於公董局的內部組織，最初分爲：市政總理處，公共工程處，警務處，醫務處。到民國二十三年十二月二十一日（一九三四年）法公董局董事會認爲界內市政日繁，爲使各機關的序列和各階級的工作，有優良效能計，便决定改組局內各機構，組織便比較以前來得餒密和複雜；迨後亦有相當的改革。本年度的組織，列表如下：</p>

<h3>昨仍滯留香港　汪精衛並未來滬　各方傳到滬查明不確　褚民誼離庽未知何往</h3>
<p>汪精衛因違反黨國紀律、經中央决議開除黨籍、並予撤職後、關於在之行蹤、日來港滬各地、傳說甚多、前晚及昨日本埠方面、有傳其業已抵滬、並有謂其已赴虹口之訊、經本報記者多方探詢、汪到滬之說、殆不可靠、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<p>意輪並無　汪之蹤跡</p>
<p>在來滬之訊、本埠方面、前晚卽有此傳說、據謂係由港搭意輪康脫羅素來滬、而於前日在虹口大阪碼頭登岸者、嗣經記者調查、康脫羅素係於上月三十一日上午十時抵滬、所謂該輪二日到滬之說、當屬傳誤、現該輪已定今日上午六時自滬啟椗返歐、該郵船公司方面、亦曾吾認在係搭該輪來滬，</p>
<p>褚民誼昨　出外未歸</p>
<p>昨日本埠忽又喧傳汪業已到滬、係因虹口方面曾於二日晚間宣布特別戒嚴、日方陸戰隊密佈崗位、幷斷絕交通、傳者以該處此次戒嚴、逈異平時、遂認爲係汪到滬之勞證、幷有傳汪寓百老匯大厦之說、嗣經調查、亦屬傳誤、記者昨晚幷遍訪留滬已久之褚民誼、惟均未能晤及、據息、褚前日尙在滬、昨日其司閽者答記者云、褚係昨晨外出、至記者往訪時尙未返寓、至褚氏他往之說、亦尙難蹬實、</p>
<p>汪之來滬　絕非事實</p>
<p>又據確息、自昨日下午各晚報刋載汪精衛秘密到滬之迷離消息後、遂引起本埠各界人仕深切之注意、本報記者爲求證實眞相起見、特從多方面奔走刺探、迄至深夜、始經可靠方面之證實、謂截至昨日爲止、在尙滯留香港、外間所傳在乘意郵船業經抵滬一節、絕非事實、</p>

<h3>滬東區內　汽車迭肇禍端　德人車與日人車互撞　法租界防止肇禍收效</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨日（二日）午後一時左右、某德人自備汽車一輛往游戰區、在滙山區唐山路與兆豐路交又處、與日人經營並由日人駕駛之公共汽車相撞、結果自備汽車中有居百老滙大厦之德婦一人受傷、幸傷勢不重、即經送返其家、惟汽車損壊頗重、又元旦日晨的八時一刻、某華人駕駛之</p>
<p>德人卡車</p>
<p>一輛在東百老滙路元芳路口與日人三輪機器脚踏車一輛相撞、該機器脚踏軍係日本海軍陸戰隊所有、由日本海軍士兵一名駕駛、側車及後座各坐日本學生一名、相擅極爲猛烈、機器脚踏車竟至起火、側車中之學生遭焚斃、另一學生亦受傷、惟該海軍士兵、則顯未受傷、昨據法租界警務處高級人員語記者云、</p>
<p>新年假期</p>
<p>中、法租界並無車輛肇禍之重大案、但警務處確切進行减少許多卡車肇禍之運動、派特別巡邏捕在法租界車行較繁忙之通衢巡邏、日夜隨時令載重卡車停止、而以特別器具測騐該車之煞車效能、是項運動均在兩月以前開始、難尙無肇禍之準確計算、而與一九三七年者作一比較、彼等的確希望今年之</p>
<p>致命肇禍</p>
<p>案、可以大减、去年中汽車肇禍而有人死亡者、計五十一起、但一九三七年戰事發生起、法租界交通日見甚繁、彼等有種種理由可信、若按時縝密試騐煞東效能、發現其在標準以下、以科以罰鍰、於是因交通聚禍而致死傷者、其數必减低云、記者詢是吾普通汽車亦將加以同樣試騐、該人員云、並未試騐、因警務處不欲使行人無端受有不便利故也、但若警務處以爲將來有試騐普通乘人汽車之必要者、則亦將作此舉、</p>

<h3>今日之無錫工業　大廠家多願仰人鼻息　小絲廠偏能自力更生</h3>
<p>— 彩華</p>
<p>中國四大米市之一，京滬綫上重鎮－無錫，工業的發達，可謂全省冠。在戰前有紡織九家，製絲廠五十餘家，麵粉四家，米行百餘家。自淪陷以來，已是一年有餘，整個無錫，充滿烏烟瘴氣，魔鬼的黑影，所有工業，均遭了空前的浩刦，各大工廠全被日人壟斷，就是小買賣亦都給其操縱，變相的分　式的華中　絲公司，大吉洋行，大興洋行等，在一把揑住無錫工業的喉管，呌他不要呼吸。筆者僅就牠的現況－無錫工業，作一報告，掛一漏萬，至所不免，敬請同道加以補充指正。</p>
<p>紡織廠</p>
<p>在戰前有申，振新，麗新，廣勤，業勤，慶豐，豫康等七家，其中以慶豐申新二廠範圍最大。麗新廠出品最多。廠房大半被燬，內部機件亦多報壞。申新振新二廠，早由日商上海紡績株式會社派員修理；豫康紗廠則由上海大康紗廠派員修理。去年十月成立的有維新和協新兩廠，新花上市時雖一度開工，但無多大交易</p>
<p>麵粉廠</p>
<p>麵粉廠的損失比絲紗兩業輕得多，損失較重的以福新茂新兩廠。廣豐麵粉廠已經開工，九豐在準備中，當然這一種開工，還不是暴露着慘狀，仰日人的鼻息！</p>
<p>製絲廠</p>
<p>執無錫工業牛耳的當然要推絲業；絲業在最盛的時代有絲廠五十餘家，絲車一萬三千多部，工人六萬多。現在總共計算起來還不及從前絲車數量的零頭，其工業狀況，可見一斑。然而日人以為有利可圖。不肯放鬆，特別組織之，「華中　絲公司」來統制它。現在復工的有振　，振元，大生，鼎昌，宏餘，福綸，潤康，禾豐，鼎盛，等九家。</p>
<p>所謂「華中　絲公司」真是黑漆一團，資本金額名義上為八百萬元，實際上恐怕是不名一錢，局外人是不得其詳的。　餘分配日取十分之六，華取十分之四。「華中公司」的目的在統制江浙戰區絲業。總辦事處設在上海虹口，分公司設無錫蘇州三地。「無錫華中　絲公司」設在城內毛梓橋堍，其組織由日人任總經理，總理以下，設各廠監督，亦由日人担任，各廠廠長，正廠長日人，副廠長均為華人，並分整理，工務，事務三部，各部之事務如下：　整理部，揭返工場，整理室，檢騐室　工務部，選　室，煮　室，　絲室，工場，倉庫間，屑吐間，原動間，修理間，　事務部，會計，工賑，庶務，雜務。茲將已開工之絲廠內容列表於後：</p>
<p>同時在絲業方面值得提出的，即有一部份絲廠從業員很有節氣，亦很有創造力，一方面不願在「華中公司」找飯吃，另方面為着一家生活，事實上不能收緊褲管，就在這種情形之下，產生了大量的家庭小型絲廠。這種小型絲廠，以八部車到十二部車最多，也有僅僅四部車的，最多的有二十部車，所有絲車和機械，都是從被燬的廠家出了二三十元一部極廉的代價買來的。所謂廠房就在家庭裏，因陋就簡裝置着絲車和機械，日夜工作，產量很可觀，也可得到相當的盈餘，「自力更生」真夠欽佩啊！</p>
<p>米業</p>
<p>其次是米行，原來在北門外一帶，米市林立。因為受此次戰事損失重大，現在後業的和新設的大約已有七十多家，營業範圍不若戰前，現在衹限本市做些小買賣，根本就談不到販運出口，即使能夠販運出口，那非得和日人合作不可，不僅捐稅手續麻煩，且亦帶有十分危險性·</p>
<p>總之，無錫現在的工業，僅及戰前十分之一，黑漆一團，到處伸着剝削的魔手，與其在日人重重壓迫下苟延殘喘，何如遷廠內地，從事抗戰需要的生產，這不僅失業者重回工廠，參加生產工作，且亦開發內地實業，與國家民族均有裨益！</p>
<h3>金融　十二月份　金價頗多起伏</h3>
<p>去年十二月份之現金暗市、承上月餘風、盤旋於二千〇三十元關內外，約有兩週餘、旋因國際借款消息逐漸透露於外、市面為之牽動、洎乎借款消息公佈後、市價乃所跌甚鉅、不數日而進二千元大關、致有廿四日一千九百五十八元之最低價、幸有港幫收進、從無間斷、市價賴以維持、不再下墜、復以蔣委員長表示中國寗肯屈服、市面立見向榮、同時津幫亦起搜購、經比兩重買風下、市價一度衝出二千元大關、終以外匯鬆緊不一、本客幫因年終關係、多頭紛紛出籠、影響所及、陷入二千元關內、故上月份之現金行情、可謂自高而下、趨勢日漸衰頹、亦為我國法幣基礎鞏固之一有力的明證也、至言交易、亦覺遜色、其總成交額、計一萬九千〇四十兩、比前月之二萬三千〇七十兩、計減四千餘兩之鉅、錢兌業因代港幫搜購、仍居買進地位、故進出兩抵、軋進亦有四千餘兩、證劵幫次之亦在購進一方、其他如銀樓業及現金號、均在賣方地位、茲將十二月份現金各業成交統計、列表如左、（單位兩）</p>
<p>賣方　買方　進出兩抵</p>
<p>錢兌業　五、五〇〇　九、五四〇　進四、〇四〇</p>

<p>總計　一九、〇四〇兩</p>
<h3>印銀加長十安那</h3>
<p>二日孟買電、印銀現貨驟然均加長十安那、期貨長十一安那、又紐約電、美銀價仍有行無市、站掛原價、英銀大條停市無電云、</p>
<h3>糖市　國產青糖　隨赤白糖以俱漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢續緊、公會劃盤、太古糖現貨Ｂ嘜浦東棧交二十三元八角、回好三角、浦西棧交二十四元、下檔照退、二四荷粗白現貨二十四元四角、轉口貨十六元二角、國糖有潮幫開中　綿白二十一元半、較前亦見提升、正綿赤回緊以來、漸趨堅定、昨高牌正綿赤開十五元二角半至二角、次之十四元六角半、最次十二元八角、青糖以赤白　漲、亦見活動、普通提荘開十二元六角、黃崗青十二元、次之十一元七角至五角、統共成交二千五六百包、建幫之刁青、號盤稍見帶好、回升二三角、以十一元一角、開出千數包、據泉州函訊、本屆新糖收成歉薄、僅及上屆十分之四五云、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗花將於五日開市　仍有向上希望</h3>
<p>本埠紗花市況、因歲首金融界休假、商業當然不克活動、茲據同業多數意見、預測五日開關、如無意外之刺激、棉業仍有起色之望、不過查近來市場上囤戶、及銀行界對於棉布囤積尤烈、而大眾意見、謂我國抗戰立場、始終一貫、內地對於進口貨物、檢騐甚嚴、就此而論、華英紗需要當有繼續不懈、不過在上年歲暮搜羅充盈、心思成交、超過實際交易一倍光景、開市後價格、如果逾高、深恐獲利之戶乘機出籠或有回落軟化、但查在最近以來出口之棉紗棉布疋頭、運往潮汕昆明海防雲南等處為夥浙東方面亦有同樣步驟、所以市面之基礎、日趨健全之途耳、</p>
<h3>南北貨　毫槐米趨勢堅定</h3>
<p>槐州毫州貨運來、至存均稀、去胃雖不過盛、但趨勢甚堅、昨市行盤售二十三元、天津貨則以外費即昂、而滙水亦高、萬難合劃、因之到存俱全、</p>
<h3>桃仁價有進展</h3>
<p>桃仁以蘭溪貨為上品、江並產者次之、前市　担售三十二元、經陸續銷售　底積漸感缺乏、而近來來源既稀、外費更繁、劃本須四十元、故刻市已升至四十五元、其勢穩定、</p>
<h3>糧食　客秈需要極旺</h3>
<p>客秈與更尖同時停市兩天後、本街需要極貪、尤以大市貨價格低廉為零戶歡迎、故晨間買氣極旺、中次各檔一律漲起角外、高貨因貨主之堅持、多未正式妥交、緣產地自日商採辦與直接轉口後、不獨成本加高　而且運輸困難、因此新到與前存各貨均擬堅守以待善價、昨雖行情漲起角外、而成交數角衹一千多包、大市蕪秈開九元六七角、高無秈須十元以上、南京特別沖埠尖則喊至十元〇四五角、但無成交云、</p>
<h3>天雨米價愈昂　斛開二萬擔</h3>
<p>日昨河下米市、已照常開業、至船共有三十多號、連輪船汽車貨約計一萬餘包、本市米店交易、因陽曆新年停市二天後、門荘需要較繁、船戶方面則以內地米價已猛高三四角、又恐來源不能再多、且天雨人心越好、市面上立即抬高、全日成交近二萬擔、新米及薄粳各升一二欠角、杜尖羊尖埠尖三種跟漲角許、糯米及時動銷、漲度更切、溧陽貨　高已到十三元六七角之價、</p>
<h3>五金　白鉛絲實銷漸動</h3>
<p>白鉛絲市面、久告寂寞、惟近數日來其趨勢有活潑希望、蓋實銷建築幫及福建幫均有採辦、且內地幫亦有問津、故市情殊熱鬧、行情雖一時不見進步、但執貨者尚不肯廉售、所以標準仍覺鎮定、昨日開出三百餘紮、如粗花色售十五元二角半、中檔花色十五元七角半、細花色十六元二角　查新貨無到、而市存涸竭、所以後市形勢殊許樂觀也、</p>
<h3>煤炭　歲首白煤　開盤即高</h3>
<p>白煤各貨、日來因天氣嚴寒、銷路頓見增加、本埠門荘店及內地客幫、俱有去胃、市態益覺緊俏、日昨新正開盤、即見做高、鴻其拷塊每噸五十元、節塊四十八元、中塊四十五元、塊子四十六元、屑子仍守原盤、無甚榮辱、蓋因邇來塊煤到貨稀少、棧房存底、又甚薄弱、不得不喊高行盤、以示限制云、</p>
<h3>坎拿大　產金之成本計算</h3>
<p>坎拿大皇家銀行十二月報告云，在最近商業衰落之際，坎拿大之經濟穩定，得力於金礦工業之輔助者頗為顯著，自一九三五年以迄一九三七年，坎拿大金產豐厚，而一九三七年全年產額，達四，〇九六，二一五兩，本年首八月間，產金額為三，〇五一，〇八一兩，此在上年同期，則為二，六七二，八一二兩，是故一九三八年之產量，　期當更有新紀錄發見也。</p>
<p>然則金礦工業對於社會經濟，究有何種輔助乎，最近由內政統計局加以分析如下，坎拿大境內金礦公司，除去職工薪水不計外，於一九三七年間，所費工業設備·電費·燃料·水腳·保險等等共為四〇百萬元美金以上，再就一九三五年度作同樣之檢查，則兩年以還，用度已增加百分之四十以上·現金礦工業，正在繼續發展中，其有助於坎拿大其他工業之促進與順利，自必與日俱增，一九三七年金礦工業用度，包括礦鑽及零件在一百萬元以上，鉛鐵管子設備一百二十五萬元，電器設備一百五十萬元，鋼鐵購置一百零一萬元，機器購置五百萬元以上，木料二百八十五萬元，其他建築材料一百三十二萬元，同時化學及其附屬工業，亦受有相當利益，如炸藥用度，價值達四百七十萬元，「合金衰養品」達一百四十六萬元，其他化學品達五十萬元，電力消費價值，達四百五十一萬元，但此猶僅為猶主要原動力而已，至若煤油汽油則需九十五萬七千元，炭煤需七十六萬元，鐵路運費需二百四十一萬元，又工人保險費及其他保費合計二百六十二萬餘元，以四千萬元消費量，由一業用之於他業，為數不為不鉅矣，然猶未也，一九三九年金礦業共雇有礦工二萬五千人，工資支出達五千八百萬元，然則合併計之，金礦工業在一九三七年間用度總數，共達一萬萬元相近矣。（A）</p>

<h3>新年的希望</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>光陰過得眞快：二十七年又像飛一般的過去了！</p>
<p>我們回想這一年中，對於被難同胞，曾吾竭力救濟他們，在全國各地慘遭兵禍的今大，我們住在上海，過着安全舒適的生活，有無藐視災禍之嫌？</p>
<p>新年到了！家家戶戶，都充滿了一團歡樂氣象，我們在此歡樂聲中，不要忘記被難同胞的凄凉景况！不要再有無意義的歡樂之情！說來很慚愧，住在上海的四百萬同胞，不能救濟上海的數萬難民，脫離痛苦的生活！我們看馬路旁邊水門汀上露宿的難胞，能不令人心痛！</p>
<p>我們今後，應努力節的救難，從事有意義的工作！</p>
<p>我希望在二十八年裹：</p>
<p>（一），要使露宿野處的同胞安度寒冬，</p>
<p>（二），要使收容所裏的難民，全數有人供養！</p>
<p>（三），要使街頭流浪的孩子，有衣有食；並有受敎育的機會</p>
<p>（四），要使早晚賣報的孩子，在工作之暇，得到報童學校求學的機會！</p>
<p>這是一個最低限度的希望！</p>
<p>我們知道，救濟難民，就是救濟國家。多救濟一個難民，就是多保存一份民族的元氣。我們應以參加節的救難的工作，做二十八年的中心工作，希望上海的同胞，共同努力實踐！</p>
<p>新年遊戲</p>
<h3>猜年歲</h3>
<p>— 懿</p>
<p>在學校開慶祝元旦的遊藝會中，有唱歌跳舞等精彩節目，其中有一位聰明的小朋友表演，猜年歲的遊戲，他的方法很簡單並且非常有趣，現在把那遊戲記述下來。</p>
<p>覺民——「新年到了我們都要大一歲了我今天要來猜猜各位的年紀誰喜歡給我猜。益華忙道：「請你猜猜我今年幾歲？」</p>
<p>覺民：「好！我現在寫出一個算式”89×9×你的年歲且”把你的年歲塡入算式後，好好的去算。不要算錯，把答數給我看—我就能猜出你的年紀。</p>
<p>益華——背了覺民，把自己的年歲11，塡入算式中，便成“”算好了就把答數“”給覺民看。</p>
<p>覺民一看就道：「你是十一歲，對嗎？」</p>
<p>益華：「呀！怎樣一些也不錯的呢？什麼綠故啦？」</p>
<p>覺：「你看啦！答數的末兩位數字，不是「十一」嗎？所以我能立刻說出「十一」來。你可知道末兩位數字，就是你年紀的理由嗎？」</p>
<p>益華一想忙拍手笑道：」知道了，知道了，“”再乘年歲，當然末兩位是年歲的數目字了。」</p>
<p>覺民笑道：「不錯！不過我還能猜出你的年紀和出生月日哩。』</p>
<p>益華：「好！好！那更好了！」</p>
<p>覺民：就寫出一個算式：對益華道：把你的年歲和生月生日，塡入各個地位後，好好的算，把準確的答數給我看，我就猜得出了！」</p>
<p>益華今年十一歲在九月十四日生的，於是他就把這些數字塡入算式中後，便算了。就把那答數給覺民猜：覺民算了一算就說：「你是十一歲九月十四日生的對嗎？」</p>
<p>益華道：「你從那裹知道的？」</p>
<p>覺民：『這是很簡便的，總之不論猜誰的年歲和出生月日，祇要把他的答數减去“”後，在這數中：小數點前的兩位數字就是生日；小數點後的兩位數字就是年歲；末了兩位數字，就是生月。現在你看啦！』在這數字中，小數點後的兩數字不是“”嗎？末了的兩位數字不是“”嗎？小數點前的兩數字不是“一千”嗎？</p>
<p>所以我知道你是十一歲在九月十四日生的。</p>
<p>益華拍手大笑，是的！是的！這個方法眞是有趣。</p>
<p>諸位看了上面的遊戲，不妨也來試試。看看究竟對不對</p>
<h3>活動自由車</h3>
<p>— 韞玉</p>
<p>一到了新年，我們常常看到許多學生少年在馬路上騎脚踏車，他們身邊有錢，只要化二角的車租，就可以騎在車上，那眞是逍遙自在，可是收容所里的難民呢？他們沒有錢沒有白相的機會，實在是無聊，現在我們這里也有一輛脚踏軍，可以任人白相，不收車租，朋友們，高輿不高興？</p>
<p>這輛車子，活動自如，而且他的速度，也非常之快（見圖）朋友們，不相信吧？且慢，一試便知。</p>
<p>（一）你先把紙上的圖樣剪下來，詳細的看淸這車子的構造，牠的式樣，是跑車的式樣，因而牠的速度也比普通的脚踏車來得輕，先請詳細的看看。</p>
<p>（二）然後你可以注視兩個輸盤，一方面手中再不停的搖動—（同篩穀的一樣）這搖動一分鐘之久。</p>
<p>（三）最後你可以立刻停止，看準這兩個輸子是否在轉勸？哈！你說希奇不希奇？牠簡直轉動得你不相信，你越動得快，牠越轉得快，要是你一直不停，牠就轉得你頭昏眼花為止</p>
<p>這是什麼道埋呢？是誰要牠轉的呢？科學家吿訴我們，這是眼睛的「錯覺」。</p>
<p>他說平常我們眼睛看一件東西，注視得太久了，往往會看出兩個形體。比方一只檯子，只要出神之後，牠的形體除了一個實在的檯子而外，我們還可以看出一個空虛的檯子的輪廓，這個就是「錯覺」。由於「錯覺」的作用，我們便看出兩個形體來。</p>
<p>那末，我們大家想想看這一輛車子經過上項第一項注視之後，這時我們巳經出了神，再將紙頭不停的搖動繼續的做第二項工作，那有不發生一錯覺一之理？</p>
<p>明白了道種道理，我們還可以明白活動電影一的理由，因為電影的構造也與「錯覺」有關，可是電影不是本文所要請的，所以我們不必多談了。</p>
<h3>一週戰事</h3>
<p>這幾天，天氣跋寒，在孤島上的人們，登在屋內尙且怕冷，一談到前方戰事，眞是使人感嘆。</p>
<p>華南方面</p>
<p>在前幾天的報紙上，傳有日艦百餘艘，集中在北海，情勢緊張，消息傳來，我們即覺得華南情勢，將有變化，因為日軍近來對於華南戰事的僵持局面，感到棘手。不得不有集中反攻的準備。據二十三日香港電，目下夸省南路形勢，甚為緊張，日艦現雲集陽江，電白，北海等處，企圖伺機登陸，並不時向岸上發砲，作登陸之嘗試，同時日方空軍，亦甚活動，屢飛各地偵察擲彈，現在北海電白已發生戰事。又電，北海港外日艦，不斷發砲，掩護部隊登陸，惟因華軍防範嚴密，迄未得逞，目下華方巳宜布戒嚴，並將通至內地之交通路綫，全行破壞，以防日軍由該處侵入桂南。</p>
<p>此項消息，這還是在一週起始幾天的消息，直到三十一日為止日軍在華南戰事綜括起來看，可以說毫無進展可言，這並不是日軍對於戰事鬆懈，而是華方配備得當，士氣奮勇的結果。所以最近的消息始終在混戰中，據曲江的電報，日軍非但沒有進展可言，而從化神崗圩，大岡嶺等陣地，反為華軍動搖。</p>
<p>「曲江電稱，盤踞鱉頭之日軍，被華軍擊潰，向從化退却後，華軍某部，即分向從化方面進攻，日軍極恐慌，遂向南撤退，華軍即克復從化城，除一面派隊追擊外，並在神崗圩，大岡嶺一帶，確實佔領陣地。」</p>
<p>又據路透香港電稱：「此間所接消息，北江華方大軍，昨日開始進攻花縣，激烈戰事，刻在進行中，增城巷戰仍極激烈，日軍一隊昨自羅浮山方面西移，企圖救援增城之日軍，但在途中即遭截擊。現西江北海方面，無大變化。」</p>
<p>由此看來，日軍在華南所記備之兵力，雖陸續增加，但因華方竭力抵抗，想達到預定目標，為時尙遠，現在雙方皆在準備，一塲惡戰，即將展開。</p>
<p>粵漢路上</p>
<p>的情形，近來也有接觸，岳陽日軍，直到現在為止，仍在華軍包圍中，華軍某部會一度衝入岳陽城，與日軍發生巷戰，嗣以日軍繼績增加，華軍乃退出城外，湘鄂公路之華軍，現更開始北攻通城，另一部則進攻崇陽通城間之沙坪，這樣一來，日軍通城之退路，將被截斷。</p>
<p>按日軍在湘邊一帶活動，事實上窮其所有力量，維持現有之局面，還成疑問？若欲實通南北路綫，收首尾相顧之功，實行起來恐不容易。</p>
<p>晉省戰事</p>
<p>本週內，亦有接觸，尤以臨汾之西北，最為激烈。日軍現分三路西進，一路向鄉寗進發，一路進攻蒲縣，一路北攻隰縣。報載有日機多架，屢飛大寗，隰縣，一帶轟炸，現在隰縣之華軍，為一百十五師部隊，巳在隰縣東南與日軍激戰，而蒲縣鄉寗一帶之華軍，係閻錫山將軍所統之七十二及六十九等師，配備極為精良，此决日軍進犯晋西，此種接觸，雖有開展，但仍為進犯西北之拭探方略，而於大舉進攻，似乎還在等待時機，亦未可知。</p>
<p>但據另一電傳晋省西南部之激戰，現方在進行中，陝省黃河東岸之日軍砲隊，猛轟禹門渡對岸及黃河與汾河滙流處之華軍陣地，西岸華軍砲隊，亦猛烈還擊，據華方當局宣稱，現有大隊華軍巳開入晋省長駐，留待應付事變，視此情形，日軍欲攻入陝省，更决不是輕而易舉的事。</p>
<p>此外還有一件事，値得我們注意的，是在先生的出走，汪精衛先生！中國國民黨副總裁，近來忽然向中央請假，出國養病，據云是前年遇刺受傷，現在舊創發作，須要出國養病，此項消息傅出後，注氏即已離開重慶，此後行踪就非常詭秘，但這到不細說，値得我注意的，即在氏忽然出走的原因，與其今後的行動，有人說在氏出走與議和有關，這一點尤其是日方與海通社的宣傳，最為聳聽。</p>
<p>不過這種的宣傳，經過蔣委員長前日在重慶紀念週中之說明後，巳有風吹雲散之勢，蔣委員長說。。「外傳在先生此决離渝他往，與日議和有關，此種離奇消息，實為無稽，日方之反宣傳，其用意乃在淆亂我聽聞，且在動搖國際上對中國抗戰之認識，在先生之離渝，純係個人行動，時至今日，斷無一人再對日本作妥協和平之想，况在先生立身處世，眞摯光明，國人共見，故外間一切傳聞，實有挑撥是非之嫌，不足置信。」</p>
<p>然而此事之演變，尙在發展，蔣委長之談話不過以君子之心度在先生不致出此而已，此事自發稿之日止，忽又電傳汪精衛竟向中央建議與日談判和平之說，實可驚異。因為篇幅關係，且聽下文分解。</p>
<h3>難民自給收容所巡禮（上）</h3>
<p>— 以信</p>
<p>去年滬戰發生後，上海兩租界的慈善團體辦了許多，在本年三月裹的統計二百另一所，後來漸漸歸併，有的辦理結束，有的收容所改為自給所。「自給所」與「收容所」究竟有什麼分別呢？「自給」是自己給養自己的意思，這裹面的難胞都能够目己生產，維持自己生活，年老和年幼的人，由他們親屬負担；年靑力强的人，仙們出去找工作做，像工廠，小販等；或在，所裹工作，如籘工，絨線，花邊，草織，拖把，縫紉等工作。不能自給的人，就搬到其他的收容所去，能够自給的遷入自給所。「收容所」裹的難胞，衣食住完全由所中供給，只有消費沒有生活；「自給所」是只供給住；衣食由他們自己負責；這是「牧容所和「自給所」的不同。筆者會過訪各所當局調查自給情形，各所互有差異，茲特把幾個自給所的情形，寫在下面，給留心難民問題的人士參考。</p>
<p>（一）第一自給所：地點在新閘路辛家花園淸凉寺一切事務由主任及副主仟担任，另有管理員管理日常事務。該所難胞由淸凉收容所裹能够自給的二千三百人組織成功的，速同服務人員，共計七百二十四人。該所備有爐灶供給難胞煮飯。關於水電醫藥等費，完全由慈聯會供給，以後計劃，每月每人徵收五分，做全所水電開支。該所敎育，成人方面還沒有舉辦；兒童方面，現有初級五班，中級一班；人數共計二百八十五人。</p>
<p>（二）第二自給所：地址在北福建路合泰棧，難民五百五十三人，該所設主仟及副主任，下分總務，人事，敎育三股。總務股分：一文書，二，會計，三，給養，四，衛生，五，庶務，五組：人事股份：一，生產二，公安三，自治四，登記四組；敎育股份：一，教導二，研究三，康樂三組。該所是合泰收容所的改組，所存難胞大部都能自給，每天由所中賣飯，每斤一百文。該所讀書的兒童和工作人員的飯食，由所中供給。水電及醫藥等費，由慈聯會担任。現有兒童班，計一年級，二年級，三年級三班，人數共計一百二十一人。受教兒童另劃一區，由自治天早晨有晨操半小時。所內另闢小茶室，專供成人工作後休息的地方，同時，常有教師演講常識和時事，這也是敎育的方法，使成人們在工作外，受到普通的智識並不感到呆板而使精神上發主厭倦。</p>

<h3>善門難開</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>大慈善家做了幾件熱心公益的事，請求救濟的人，便接踵而來，有的請求金錢，有的請求衣食，大家渴望大慈善家「開開金龍手」，給以滿意的賜予。結果，弄得大慈善家，無法擺布，祇有關起大門，做做「善人是富」的富家翁，良有以也</p>
<p>善門的確難開，一開大門，恐怕就不容易關攏來，無論中國貧苦的人多，大慈善家少，無法使一般「鶉衣百結」者流，個個滿意。就是歐洲各國，也何嘗不然。當德國的希特勒厲兵秣馬，摩攀擦掌，欲攫取捷克蘇台德區的時侯，英國的張先生大動共一片婆心，不惜降尊紆貴，飛往德國，做了一件大大的好事，使無量數的戰士們，不致犧牲於壯烈砲火之下，這種功德，眞令人沒齒不忘。</p>
<p>現在法義的屬地糾紛，又正在難解難分之際，法國的當局，雖巳明白表示，不願英國從中調解，深恐張先生把他人頭來研醬，又耍做一回慈善事業也。但義相墨索里尼，明知張先生是雅量高致，慈悲為懷，不肯輕易放手，仍竭力慫恿張先生，將義國各項要求，代達法國，因為張先生旣經成全德國於前，必不致拒絕義國耍求於後。</p>
<p>張先生已經做了一决大慈善家，諒也不願再做第二决大慈善家，但旣做了第一决大慈善家，便不容你不做第二决大慈善家。倘然不做第二决大慈善家，則第一决大慈善家的功績，亦將歸諸泡影。墨先生看準此點，必定說「老大哥！這事必定要請你老人家出來帮帮忙，行得好心有好報也」。這就呌做善門難開。</p>
<h3>苦兒試新裝</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>——慈幼協會新年散發寒衣速寫——</p>
<p>在上海這都市之中，這幾天有着許多孩子，跟着爸爸媽媽，上電影院，京戲館，回來時帶了一束玩具，糖果。可是另一面，正有着無數流浪的街童，穿着單薄而破碎的衣服，在冷風中顫抖。努力於慈幼事業的中華慈幼協會上海辦事處，為使這班無所歸宿的街童，有棉衣禦寒起見，在這新年之中，分發寒衣。先後依照地段，元旦起散發四天，第一天在愛而近路紹興同鄉會，第二天在戈登路國華中學，第三天在王家沙閘北貧兒敎養院，第四天在辣斐德路慈協敎養院，總共預備散發六千套。</p>
<p>因為國華中學離我的寓所很近，在二日早上便抽了閒去看一下散發寒衣的情形。規定的時間是上午十時起到下午三時止，當我走到國華中學的時候，還不到十點鐘，但鬥口巳圍聚着不少的苦孩子，男的，女的，自六七歲以至十三四歲的都有，每個都是蓬首垢面，穿着破碎而失去禦寒作用的衣服，比較幼小的，自幾個月以至兩三歲的，都由大人抱來。事前早巳把領寒衣券分發了，所以每一個人的手裹，都拿着綠色的衣券。接着辦事員關照他們，就一窩蜂的擁進鐵門，然而沒有寒衣券的，祇來大人不來小孩的，都不准進去。</p>
<p>國華中學課室前面的走廊裹，堆滿了一疊疊的寒衣，高得幾乎碰到屋預。操塲上用課桌，麻繩，攔成進出的走路。孩子們依决的排列着，先到先領，不得爭前。男女辦事員，每一個袖口上佩一布號，有二三十人之多，所以秩序維持得相當的好。先來的走了進去，後面還是陸績的在跑來，國華中學的外牆並不高，所以祇要點起了脚，立在外面也可看見散發寒衣的情形，所以靠戈登路的一面矮牆旁邊，也立滿了人，衹是無情的巡捕，時常要走來趕散。</p>
<p>十點鐘一刻，開始散發。苦孩子在辦事員指導之下走上平台，騐過了券，每人發給棉襖了套，尺寸有四種，依照孩子們的大小而分發。手績很快，不到一小時幾百套寒衣巳發得差不多。接着領到衣服的大人，孩子，又排了隊依决走出國華中學。每個人的手裹挾着一套新寒衣，黑布面子，白布夾裹，棉花是翻得相當的厚。每個人快樂得在雀躍，他們走出了國華中學，來不及的穿在身上試試，大小配身不配身，有幾個守在外面的大人，看見兒女拿到了新衣服，也非常的快樂。也許這些孩子，是一輩子沒有穿過道樣的新衣服呢！我們露得感謝中華幼慈協會同人的努力，但希望各界能繼續努力指款讓這些小生命能普遍地度過這嚴寒的冬天。</p>

<h3>珍珠衫</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>華新影業公司出品　新光大戲院映</p>
<p>華納夏能的「陳查禮探案」，在二十世紀的製片計劃中，已列入每年必需攝製幾部以上的「當然出品」了，但是不幸得很，這株「搖錢樹」因患心臟病，於去年逝世。華納夏能逝世以後，「陳查禮探案」自然不能繼續攝製，但很迅速地，二十世紀又創造了一位「大偵探穆托」，並且依舊由飾演陳查禮兒子的中國明星陸錫麒做帮手。這「大偵探穆托」是由彼得勞雷扮演的，他曾主演過恐怖片「人魔」，他的「穆托」自然又創造了一個新的作風、但是最近消息傳家，二十世紀巳另外物色到一位新入，他的面貌頗像　納夏能，那來，二十世紀农）　沒有放棄攝製「陳查禮探案」的計劃</p>
<p>現在華新公司攝製這部「珍珠衫」，大概也是動機於徐莘園的酷肖華納夏能吧。眞的，徐莘園的面部輪廓，身材，舉止，在銀幕上所看到的，可以說和華納夏能一般無二。</p>
<p>「珍珠衫」的編導人是過去編導「翡翠馬」「生龍活虎」等偵探片的徐欣夫。以他過去的經驗來攝製這部中國大偵探陳查禮回國第一驚人大探案「珍珠衫」，是顯著地有了若干進步。第一，他在這探案中液輸了科學智識，如陳查禮故意讓强盜在茶室搶去一宗價値二萬元的珠寶，而在珠寶盒內裝置一個發電機，等到發電機發電的時候，可以在一個自己特製的無線電盒中測騐盜窟的方向所在；陳查禮被捕之後，利用袖珍發昔機求援等，使一般觀衆在娛樂的時候，無意接受科學的灌輸，這正做到了電影是敎育的工具這原則的。不過，由於一具無綫電修理用具的突然停止電流，和播音機的聲音突然中斷，而發現誰是正兇，我們對於「避雷珠」這種「珍買」是相當有疑問的。</p>
<p>同樣，導演手法也比較有了進步，如開始時趙公館古墓圖樣的被盜，他先寫趙嘯藩的姪兒晚上遲歸，鬼鬼祟祟的樣子，及汽車夫調戲婢女的行動詭秘，然後再寫保險箱被盜，這「疑陣」是佈置得非常巧妙的。在陳查禮回國接手這案子的時候，珍珠衫却於早一天被盜，接着幾個和珍珠衫相當有關係的綫索，如許得勝的被害，老實的被殺，又在兇案接一連二發生之中，蒙蔽了過去。這比過去的作品，一開塲就知道誰是兇手，好得多了。</p>
<p>但是，這里也有破綻的地方，如古墓被盗之後，這有着嚴密的組織盜黨，他們决不會立刻把玉器交古董商人出售，雖然在老董被殺的時候，由小楊嘴里補了一句「敎你走洋商，為什麼售給聚貿齋」？（大意）不過，這還是不够的，像這樣的竊盜組織，把贓物出手是不會假手他人的。又，胡烈是盜黨中唯一能够見到「老大」的得力人手，他應該是非常機警的人物，但他糊里糊塗地把賊物翠鐲送給白姑娘了。這兩點，我認為是最大的漏洞。</p>
<p>徐莘園的陳查禮，私人的意見，以為不必完全效學華納夏能那樣遲緩的舉動，（那是外國人設想的中國人舉動）他不妨機警，敏捷一點。</p>
<h3>我們的生活</h3>
<p>— 許由</p>
<p>我們本來是過着非人的生活，自從「八一三」戰爭以後，我們的生活更一天一天的恐慌下來，一天一天的難過下去。在「八一三」以前，一天祇要做七八個鐘點，可以賺四五毛錢，現在一天做十幾十個鐘點的工，也祇不過賺二毛幾分。</p>
<p>因為我們收入的細微，所以我們的生活，實非我筆墨所能形容，眞是惡劣得不成樣呢！現在我姑且把日常的生活情形，略略地來報告給謮者聽吧！</p>
<p>住宿</p>
<p>我們所住的地方，大都是三層擱和二層擱，空氣惡濁萬分，一間房間至少要睡十幾個人，橫一張，直一張，均是舖位，我們也無所謂床，在地板上舖着就是了。倘若在炎熱的夏天裏，蚊子和臭蟲，將我們做它們的食糧。所以我們的疾病，也較普通人為多。</p>
<p>飲食</p>
<p>普通早晚兩次粥，中午吃頓乾飯，苛刻點祇吃二頓，在上午十時左右吃一頓以後，至下午五時再吃第二頓，小菜都是豆腐，荳芽，自鹼菜，蘿葡乾等，魚肉的味道是從未嘗過的；凡遇做夜工時，廠內發給我們每人六個銅元是供給我們半夜要買大餅吃的，在這整個十二小時的夜工裹，雖然咬着二個大餅，然怎能抵得住肚中的飢餓呢！</p>
<p>衣服</p>
<p>在我們的生活尙難維持之下，當然不會夢想有什麼漂亮的衣服，簡直運粗陋的衣服，都沒有齊備；當冬天到來的時候，我們的衣服，尤覺困難，然那班可憐的小姑嫂，看見別人的襪子和手帕等，寗願挨着餓，省下幾個銅元，去買那手帕和襪子，這和那班穿十幾元一雙襪子的太太小妣們，眞有夭壤之別。</p>
<p>工作</p>
<p>我們在早上四點多鐘的時侯，就從硬板上爬起來，拖着沉重的脚步，走向那吃人的工廠裏面，繼續地做那機械的工作。我們由上午五時起到下午七時止，每天要做十四小時以上的工作，在工作的時間內，如果稍一講話，或玩了一回，那末工頭的鞭子，便會落到我們的頭上，可以說是天天過着那變相的牢獄生活！</p>
<p>上面所寫的，不過是我們日常生活的大槪，啊！我們現在簡直如一只被關在籠中之鳥了！一切的自由和幸福，都困生活而被剝奪去了？苦悶，憤恨，不斷地從我內心中燃燒着，然則，我知道這祇是在不合理的社會制度裏，才有這種事。所以，我們不但不悲觀，祇有不斷地向惡勢力鬥爭！雖然，現在因生活問題而不得不忍耐一點，但我們决不屈服在惡勢力之下。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第一回　獨臂翁組織自由村　雙胞女禮瞻先烈墓原來這位鄉下敎師先生，姓朱，名字是根源兩字。鄉下人沒有什麼大號別字，根源就是根源，名號一致。不過一班熟人，在鄉下都喚他一聲老源，朱老源就是在那鎭上都聞名的。因為他是在這鎭上算是一個明白而有决斷的人，全村或有什麼解决不下的事，都去問朱老源。凡有什麼疑難的事，往往由朱老源給想法子，就處理淸楚了。這也是全村子人都服他，所以能够如此。在民國二十三四年的當兒，中國有好幾處地方，訓練壯丁。這個消息，就傳到村子裹來，別個村子，還不明白訓練壯丁的意義的，到了朱老源的村子裹，許多年富力强的靑年壯了，都興高采烈起來。這一點，不要說朱老源沒有功勞，因為他，在平素日子裹，常常講給一班人聽。現在我們中國的前途，如何的危險：外國人如何的厲害；亡了國，如何的慘痛。又吿訴他們，中國向來稱為弱國。所以稱為弱國，就是人民沒有堅强的意志，沒有鍛鍊的身體，因此，不能抗强敵。他這一番話，說得那些村中少年，都是躍躍欲試。原來那些村中少年，也多半是他的學生，學生們自然聽先生　話了。那班農村少年，平日間就在耍槍使棒，托千斤石，打少林拳，高與非凡，及至壯—訓練臨到那個村子的時候，那班少年就非常踴躍，大家都爭去報名。鄉下人本來起身得早，現在天還沒亮，他們都起來早操了。不但是村中的許多少年，便是朱老源自己，也在裹面做了個引導的人兒。當時某一個軍隊裹，派了一位敎導軍官，這位軍官的軍事知識很好的。除了敎他們操練以外，常常有番訓話。道訓話不是十分嚴肅的，而是一種勸導的，獎勵的，使那班農村子弟，聽了很為樂意。那軍官知道朱老源，是全村表率的人，便升他做了隊長，當然朱老源也更為起勁了。這時那個村子，好像武裝起來了，雖然只値得兩元五角的一套軍服，那鄉村子弟們穿了，早操回家，在田岸上走來，豎直了身子，挺起了腰眼，好不威武呀！（四）</p>

<h3>一九三九的序幕　粵劇伶人戰後的覿面禮　之七日這一天的更新舞臺見面</h3>
<p>— 樹康</p>
<p>一九三九的序幕，巳經揭開了，戲劇界的第一件大事，我想在這樣短短的幾天中，要算置東戲的角兒，在戰後的上海，第一决與旅滬的粵人作初决的觀面，算是重耍呢！說起廣東戲到上海，戰前是很平凡的，戰後却相當的困難，假使沒有特殊的表現，他們是不容易來的。在去年的秋間，香港的粵劇藝人，曾經有過决議，暫時不到外埠，因為絕對的拒絕與人合作；這决的來，我敢說機會値得寶貴，不比普通的戲劇。</p>
<p>這一决到滬的角兒，除掉文武生的桂名揚以外，還有一位粵劇的彗星羅家權，這是四大丑生的領袖人物，在廣東人的心目中，有不曉得薛覺先的，可沒有不知羅家權的。其决是小武生梁蔭棠和新珠，都是新興而有藝術的角色。坤角方面，當然大家都知道譚玉蘭唐雪倩，可是這肢人物，巳經不輕易露演了，而且時代的巨輸，時時向前推動；繼承她們而起的文華妹，紫蘭女，和華麗思，都是貌美而富有絕頂藝術的坤角，我想新時代的人們，對於新時代的角兒，當然應該有着好感。</p>
<p>這一批粵劇的伶人們，懷着滿腔的熱望，快到上海來了，昨天主持粵劇事務的翔昇公司，已經接得電報，今天下午二時，乘着昌興公司的海輸，乘風破浪而來，上海廣東同鄉方面，已經籌備盛大的歡迎，她們一行登臺的日期，大概在本月七日的夜間。</p>
<p>整個的上海人士，都浸淫在享樂的氛圍中，我今天報吿這一件消息，不應該算是掃興吧！　（耒臣）</p>
<h3>新年與游藝　（續完）</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>元明的元旦和元脊樂事，見於「雍熙樂府」卷一·四·八·九·十一·十三諸冊，諸如「燈夕」「燈詞」「元宵「允夜」之類，計凡套曲二十篇左右，因篇幅關係，不暇詳舉，總之，那些都是研究百戲（即諸般雜耍）的好材料，可以與漢張衡的「西京賦」李允的「平樂觀賦」合看的。姑舉數例：賈仲名燈詞云：「喬三敎喜動音樂，醉八仙快跚高撬。」曹孟修元宵云：「見見見傀儡兒齊來，一個個手擎着珍寶，出出出繞週圍幾遭。……是是是院本做一段喬敎學，賀賀賀一齊的舞起村田樂。」無名氏元夜云：「貨郎兒由恁來賒，耍孩兒竹馬鍱　。」無名氏燈詞云：「笑人的院本其實俏，一壁廂舞鮑老。」如上所舉，可見元明的正月十五與宋朝沒有什麼很大的分別。</p>
<p>清代的元旦可舉昇平署的檔案爲例。周明泰的「情昇平署存檔事例漫抄」把元旦的演劇統統放在一起。淸宮常演的弋腔有敬德釣魚等，（僅道光三年有之四年就沒有了。）月令承應戲有「膺受多福」「萬福攸同」「開筵稱慶」「賀節詼諧』之類，大都是討吉利的無聊戲（有古宮博物院刊本）崑曲有掃花。三醉。喬醋。山門。訪素之類，分載於道光三年到同治三年的恩賞日記檔。但到了同治五年的恩賞日記檔，却又加入了平劇靑石山。金水橋。趙家樓。探親以及擋諒，於此可見從弋腔經過崑腔到亂彈的轉變。</p>
<p>現代的遊藝，比方說今年吧，其意義或許在欣喜於全面抗戰的民氣一致和蔣委員長的抗戰到底的决心上。那末，像金素琴的「梁紅玉」，陳雲裳的「木蘭從軍」，周信芳王熙春的「香妃恨」，仙霓社的「明末遺恨」，在雲峯的「金槍傳」，許繼祥蔣一飛張鴻聲夏志飛的「英烈傳」，李漢臣的「岳傳」……之類，該是比較有意義的吧？</p>
<p>雖是說新年遊藝，却彷彿說了具體而微的戲劇史，這就是我寫作的一貼微意。</p>
<h3>點綴沉寂的新年　記綢布社聯歡大會</h3>
<p>— 屬吾</p>
<p>綢布社，是綢緞棉布業求知互助社的簡稱，是綢緞棉布業的同人，本着「利用業餘時間，聯絡情感，研究眞實技能，切磋各種學識」為宗旨，在去年秋間成立的；社址本來在信大祥大樓，因為社務的發達和社員的擴充，原址不够應用，所以新近遷移到天津路二六〇號的二樓，當新年在愉快的歡聲中來了的時候，綢布社也就充滿了新的朝氣。</p>
<p>綢布社是為着謀全體同業同人的福利而設立的，所以他們的設施，也就依照着這目標做去。除了創立圖書館，設立補習學校，出版綢布月刋等事業以外，還舉辦各種高尙的娛樂，使同人在公餘能改變以往腐敗的生活。綢布社巳經組織的娛樂，有乒乓。口琴。奕棋。歌詠。絲竹。平劇和話劇等等，這决聯歡大會，也就是平日所練習的成績的表顯。</p>
<p>我踏進了綢布社，時鐘剛嗚七下，來賓是擠滿了所有的座位，在風琴和二胡的伴奏聲中，幕漸漸的揭開了，首先是主席報吿，接着是「徵求隊編隊。事先，幹事會在社員中，選舉了二十多個隊長，用競賽的方式，使每人盡力的去介紹新社員，希望將原有二百多個社員擴充到一倍以上，個別的把各隊長介紹以後，便是聯誼劇社第一個話劇——「一杯牛奶」。全劇的意義，是描寫一個虛偽的所謂「慈善家」，只知沽名釣譽，現實的慈善事業擺在他眼前，郤父不幹了，一慕充滿笑料的喜劇，直把一部分偽君子的眞面目，暴露無餘！其决是歌詠，由男女兩部合唱，唱的是「新生活運動」「滿江紅」「嘉陵江上」和「光明」。末後，因為來賓的要求，又添了一隻「伏雨加船夫曲」。無論在音調和配合上講，都已經到了純熱的地步。社員的自由歌唱，可就沒這樣好了。但是他們的熱心，郤是可佩的！</p>
<p>第二决聯誼社歌唱，是一對靑年男女的「聖誕花」，因為歌詞的滑稽，大家笑了，連唱的人也笑了。慕便突然的閉起來，經過來賓同聲的請求，才繼續的唱完，博得大聲的喝采，和止不住的狂笑！</p>
<p>壓軸的話劇「黎明」沒有開慕以前，又是主席的報告，預備在舊歷新年的時候，來一决更大的聯歡會。我們熱誠的等待着「黎明」也是一齣獨幕劇，似乎是聯歡會中最出奇的一個節目。表演方面，演員是盡了最大的努力，各人都很好。不過，劇中的意思，郤不够明朗，反不如「一杯牛奶」來得辛辣而有味。全劇完了以後，觀衆還不能抓住牠的主意所在，並且，幕後的提示，響得連觀劇的人也聽到，這是應該絕對避免的！就全體講來，只經過了倉卒的籌備，而居然有這樣的成績，賽在是很難得的。我想舊歷新年第二决聯歡會的時候，一定有更好的成績演出，期待着吧！</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘　（六）（四）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>余叔岩歷訪明師十餘人</p>
<p>錢金福是唱武净的。因為內襯胖襖，所以起壩抬得極高。至於「珠簾寨」的李克用，旣歸生行爨演，當然只能照靠把老生的規矩，起個半壩，半壩就是兩膀略上抬，使成橢圓形，姿勢亦甚單簡。叔岩因係金福所援，兩膀總是抬得過高，後來雖曾有人吿訴過他，勸他改動一下，然而先入為主，却是一樁很困難的事呢。「問樵」同「天雷報」的身段，的確得力於王拴子的居多，「鬧府」書房中的作派，叉是金福所說，這一齣全本「瓊林宴」耍有錢王兩人為配，叔石演來自必出色。現在道般老角全都歿了，無怪叔岩不再出演。此外如程繼仙鮑吉祥也部與叔岩有半師半友的關係，他因為注大頭裘桂仙這般人都是能唱能拉的名伶，遂又從老元彥衡等畢習胡琴，從前他的琴師李佩鄉還是他訓練出來的名手，他的多才多藝同他訪求明師之衆多，現在內行裹恐怕沒有第二個人了。</p>
<p>偷聽叔岩吊嗓的妙法</p>
<p>從前常被人家呼為小余的叔岩，現在也巳半百之年，居然成為今日鬚生的泰斗，並且很有當年譚大王的派頭了。我國先哲所說的日出而作，日入而息，叔岩却適輿此語相反，他每日「黎明即睡」電燈來火時，才慢慢起床，等到吃過晚點（要照美國的時間却算早點）再過足烟　，差不多快到十二點了。別人都入了睡鄉，那時却瞧見一位瘦弱的琴師名呌朱家　的，無精打彩個樣兒携了一把胡琴，鑽進椿樹二條的余宅。這時叔岩正在興高采烈，精神抖擻，常來的幾位朋友如張伯駒，李適可，樂元可這般人都開足了話匣子，（並非聽留聲機，是這般人滔滔不絕的講話。）說些個笑話，談兩句戲肋，冉不然就拿着票友或別的內行老生斵樂子，叔岩的談鋒甚健，有時用幾句俏皮話打趣個人兒，也着實幽默非常。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>從哥雅說起</h3>
<p>— 鬭勤</p>
<p>因為日本「第一流作家佐藤春夫到上海賞　　後的閘北，說是像看見哥雅底畫一樣，我於是想起了目前繪畫上的一些問題。</p>
<p>實在說來，若是目前眞的有哥雅那樣的書家，倒是極需要的。且先不要說他已經有著名的「戰爭的災害二類的作品，就只以他作盡的態度來說，他若是活在目前，他底作品一定會有絕大的作用。但那作用不待說却不是佐藤春夫所追求的奇特味。</p>
<p>我們可以坦白地說，像這樣的書家，中國根本便沒有過，中國底風俗書，往往只是簡單的歷史畫，而且最高的成就，也不過勉强可以比一比法國羅珂珂時代的畫家華朶（Wattean）而已。但這也只能勉强地比一比。—不過在淸末，却出現了一位大畫家，那便是吳嘉猷，號呌作友如的這個人</p>
<p>這位畫家底名字巳經很久被人忘却了，最近有人談「上海掌故」，纔又被咐帶地提起。這是應該的。吳友如底功結，從一般說來是有兩種：第一，創作了眞正的風俗書；第二，創作了大規模的連環圖書。這兩項，在中國底書史上，都算是空前的。他不但使繪盡和時事發生了密切關係，而且還用繒畫作了反抗外禍的武器。我手頭並沒有「點石齋書報」和「飛影閣畫報」，不過記得他底作品中，除了關於當時主要時事的中法戰爭的描寫而外，還有對於租界法庭的抗議。自然，他沒有直接反對過淸廷，甚至有時還表揚過淸廷，而他寫實的技術有時也是幼稚的，但那些却都應當歸之於他底環境和他底時代。</p>
<p>在近人著的研究中國繪畫的著作（例如俞劍華先生底「中國繪書史」）中，幾乎就沒有吳友如這個名字。和吳友如同時而也是住在上海，也是以畫人物出名的書家，大家却寗可記得一個錢慧安。原因是：錢是雅，吳是俗。自然，若照中國書畢的理論來說，錢是够格的。但錢所書的是甚麼呢？只是完全和他底周圍毫沒有關涉的一些士女（那和吳所作的歷史畫根本是不同的）。雅，自然是好的，不過雅到絕頂，我看還是大米底山水為最徹底；用筆去任意地點一陣，是絲毫「匠氣」也不帶的，然而那用處却是怎樣，也呌人說不出來。</p>
<p>我並不是說，目前的畫家一定要學吳友如；我只是說，像吳友如那樣的書家在目前依然是需要的。他那種態度，那種計劃，那種取材，目前的書家都有注意的必要。倘是現在能有書家像吳友如一樣，辦一種那樣的畫報，我看依然還有作用。自然，眞正的新聞，現在是有照像了，然而像吳友如似的，提煉出時事的精華，畫出追擊與諷刺的實在脚色，而且更不妨像吳友如似的，在書端加一段通俗的解釋，那還是極有意義的。—至於技術是更進步的，是更熔化於新的技術中的，那自然是無須多說。</p>
<p>現在上海還有美術學校，可是我根本不知道那裹面課程是怎麼樣。不過照一向的「藝風」推測起來，現在到交外去寫生自然是辦不到了，但大槪還是書室裹烘起火來，描着樑體的模特兒，所拷貝的大概還是拉飛耳一流底聖母像罷，自然，基本的課程，誰也不能說不該學的。不過在目前，我以為旣是有時間用西牟過去的作品來鍛煉藝術，那與其拷貝拉飛耳，倒眞的不如拷貝哥雅一流底作品要有用處得多。還有像杜米艾（Daumier），羅多萊克（Toulouse　Lantree）等作品，我覺得學一學也未必錯。—這只是我隨便想起的兩個畫家，那種藝術應用在目前自然是不够，然而那種方法要是展開時，至少可以暴露這孤島上某部分的糜爛，至少可以淋漓地鈎出漢奸底原形。不過道兩個畫家在西洋却也被認為有「匠氣」的畫家，美術史上也往往沒有他們底名字的。</p>
<h3>夜行軍</h3>
<p>— 東號</p>
<p>夜，無邊際的黑暗。</p>
<p>沒有月，也沒有星，祗有刺刀的寒光在黑暗中閃爍。從各方面集結起來的弟兄們排成鋼鐵般的隊伍，穿過叢林，穿過荒凉的村莊，向茫茫的原野前進。</p>
<p>四周是死一般的靜寂；而每一個戰士的心中，却像有千萬匹馬在奔騰。急促的步伐，　在散滿了碎石的泥路上，發出「殺殺」的響聲，好像在鼓勵着千寓個戰士的勇氣。</p>
<p>盤過一座山脚，是一堆陰森森的茂盛的蘆葦，小徑太狹，兩旁的藘葉逐一吻着戰士們的臉。寒風掠過，發出颼颼的聲音，天空中濃厚的雲朵也跟著迅速地向前飛馳。在隊伍裹常會發出細碎的語聲，—大家都討論著即將到來的不平凡的遭遇。</p>
<p>一個挑子彈的民伕，氣喘吁吁地，淌了滿頭的汗，隊長低低地向他說：</p>
<p>「你累了，歇一會吧！」</p>
<p>「不，不打緊，我送老總們過了鐵道就可以回來的」。</p>
<p>雖然是短短的幾句對話，但却充分地表現出軍民合作的精神。</p>
<p>時間巳過午夜，大的鐵路就在不遠了。因為隊長已傳出命令：「衝過鐵路的時候，要走在鋪在鐵路上的蔴袋上面。也許敵人會把鐵道通上電流的。」</p>
<p>在黑暗中摸索了一會兒，前面突然停住了。大隊起了騷動。每個人的心房跳動突然加劇；肩上的來復槍也拿下來作預備放的姿勢。</p>
<p>「報告隊長：偵悉前面沒有敵人！」急促而尖銳的語聲打破了沉寂的空氣。頓時，「殺殺」的脚步聲又起了，緊張的心情也鬆弛了。許多人在咳嗽，低聲地談話，說笑。隊長又發出命令：「不許響，脚步放得輕，準備衝過鐵路！」</p>
<p>緊張，興奮，好奇，……各種莫名的情緒，分別佔據了每一個人的心頭。熱血在沸騰，使人忘掉從四面襲來的夜凉。手，按在槍機上，準備應付敵人射來的火花。</p>
<p>到了！兩道躺在地上的白光已呈現在眼底。長官們站在路旁，等待大除的通過。每一個人像發現寶藏似的，用愉快而輕鬆的步調，走過這敵人恃為命脈的鐵路綫。</p>
<p>也許敵人正躱在營壘裹做着懷鄉的好夢吧！很順利地，除伍安然通過了鐵路。但大家似乎有點失望，回頭望那蜿蜓遠去的鐵軌，嘰咕着：「連鬼的半條腿都沒有看見！」</p>
<h3>新年試筆</h3>
<p>— 王墳</p>
<p>馱負着生活重載的一年，輕輕地溜走了；咀嚼這一年所留給我的悲傷和歡樂，心裏之漾着不可言說的味兒。在我短短的生命史中，道一年的生活，的確留下了一個難以磨滅的痕跡。然而歡樂也好，悲傷也好，除了深鐫在心膜上的烙印以外，什麼都像烟似地溜去了。一份嶄新的日暦，懸挂在我書桌的跟前，鮮明的字跡昭示着我：這又是一個年頭的開始。這未來的日子將會給我什麼呢？我不禁叉茫然起來了！不過一年來的流亡生涯，巳把我磨鍊得相當的堅靭與碩健；受得起艱苦，也忍得住哀愁，令然這些安排在我眼前的日子，也許千百倍地苦難於過去的一年，我也相信自己能够打發過去的。</p>
<p>當我在前年的新年，悠閒地執筆的時候，連夢也沒有做到過下一個新年，竟會飄泊到遙遠的湖南；正如去年的新年，在湘鄉踏雪遊山的時候，也想不到今年的新年，竟會來到這個繁盛昇平的孤島。同樣的，我在此刻過新年，誰能够說得定明年的今天，又會在什麼地方呢？一切是不可知，一切是夢似的飄忽，時間在欺人，命運也在捉弄着我。可是生活的意義，何嘗不是就在這種夢似的飄忽中呢？我並不把飄泊當作苦事，（世界上據說還有許多終身飄泊的人！）反之，我覺得飄泊的生活，甚至流亡的生活，也是頗有意義的。就說去年的今天，我們在那小小的縣城裹，踏雪遊山；朔風呼呼地吹來，把那堆垜在山地上的積雪刮到半空，蝴蝶似的亂舞了一陣，又復頹然地落下；我們並不怕冷，拉住了帽子的邊沿，踽踽地在雪地裹行走，看一個個足印，留在銀似的山地上，彷彿看到了自己的不朽的事業，遺留在人間。那種快感是一時形容不出的！及至遊山歸來，我們便打了一點好酒，慢慢地在炭盆邊喝着，讓沉默佔領了這個　寒的空間，回味羞家園的殘夢；聽滿街的孩子，在雪地上奔跑，呼喊。燃放爆竹，高唱不成腔調的軍歌，甜蜜的幻夢破滅了，兩顂上塗了一點酒意，兩行淚珠，然而心裹是愉快的，因為在前面好像有一盞光明的燈，燭照着我這程艱苦的行旅。我歡喜多變的生涯，飄泊和流亡，才是最有意義的呢！</p>
<p>而今却在這裹過新年了。歡樂和淫逸文飾着這個多難的新年，有誰想得到：在國土的那一方，正張蓋着漫天的戰幕？流血，死亡，奔逃，顛沛，支配着大半個中國，而這裹，爵士樂却壓倒了受難者的呻吟，色情的在歡簡直吞噬了許多靑年的志氣。是昇平的景象嗎？盜刦，飢餓，和殺戮，那是每天都有的事；好在新年的歡宴前，决沒有這類煞風景的變故；孤島的新年，畢竟在歡樂中到來了。</p>
<p>放在我面前的一年，於我是一個神秘的謎。帶着驚喜交併的心情，我將好好地安排這一天天的日子。然而誰能够逆料呢？這未來的一年？聽着滿街的市聲，我父覺得茫然起來了！</p>
<h3>打狗</h3>
<p>— 馬力</p>
<p>狗，有好幾等標的狗：有搖尾乞憐的哈叭狗，有滿身發臭的癩皮狗，有胡亂在吠的惡狗，有毒牙傷人的瘋狗；還有些　賊作父，認鬼作主的狗，更有些說着人話，裝着人樣。而却在暗中偷偷摸摸地發着狗性。幹着狗的勾當的狗，這兩種狗，我們無以名之，就稱之為陰陽狗，刻毒狗。</p>
<p>對於這些狗，我們做人的，千萬不能放縱，也千萬不可大意；吾則給牠們蹦跳偷食，大呌亂咬，不但使人不安寗，而且還會使人受損害；要是給他們成羣結隊，把人世界鬧成了狗世界，那更不堪設想了！</p>
<p>因而，我們做人的，必須羣起而打狗。要出力地打：把牠們打出了門，打落了水，還不可放鬆，仍須加緊地打：把牠們打死打减，打盡打絕；使在我們人的世界裏，沒有一點狗的氣息，這才罷休！</p>
<p>尤其在這打鬼的時期裹，大家更須細心地防狗，勇猛地打狗。打盡了那許多帮鬼害人的走狗，打絕了那許多在後搗亂的賊狗，才能破壞鬼的魔力，才能增强我們人的營壘，而把鬼打擊得落花流水！</p>
<p>注意着：交着鬼朋友的狗，果然耍打，昆在人中間的句，也必頁打；而且謹防着那些出門的狗會回轉頭來張牙舞爪，那些落水的狗會跳上岸來反咬一口，而不能不這續拚命地打；同時也要謹防那些套着人衣而實則狗腔狗調的狗，會製造機會，勃發狗性，而不得不立即把也們看管住，鎖起來，綑紮好，甚至趁着便利，打個悶死！</p>
<p>打狗是打鬼中的一件重要工作，大家千萬不要小覷了他。做人的，趕快一致拿起棒來，一邊打鬼，一邊打狗呵！</p>
<h3>焦土頌</h3>
<p>— 弋人</p>
<p>我歌頌焦土，我歌頌焦土。</p>
<p>鐘擺的的答答地裂破了午夜的况靜，一下下敲着我的記憶。</p>
<p>記憶里，一片火光，一片黑烟，半天染個通紅。</p>
<p>這火光，這黑暗，蔓延了，瘋在了；火舌舐着整個的大地。</p>
<p>一切毀滅了，一切都毀滅了！</p>
<p>可是，沒有淚，也沒有太息。一聲聲，一滴滴，那是怯弱者的符號，呵，咱們是大鎔爐中鍛鍊出來的鐵的嬰孩</p>
<p>新的生命在瓦礫堆中茁長了，自由的民族在這廢墟上建立了！</p>
<p>而這火，將炙乾了魔鬼們的血；這黑烟，將窒息了魔鬼們的呼吸；這焦土，將埋葬了魔鬼們的生命。</p>
<p>焦土是魔鬼們的墳塋呵！</p>
<p>永遠呵，永遠，咱們的祖國要在焦土中建立起！</p>
<p>在夢里，我也歌頌焦土！</p>
<p>焦土呵！我歌頌您。</p>

<h3>Universally Denouncing Wang Jingwei and Supporting the Government's Determination to Fight to the End; Guangdong Military and Political Leaders Li Han-hun and Others Will Issue a Circular Telegram Condemning Wang; Some Central Committee Members and Military Figures Advocate for a Public Order for His Arrest; It is Reported That There Will Be a Reshuffle of Political Institutions Soon</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The elements of the puppet organization in Guangzhou are greatly demoralized due to the failure of their pro-peace efforts. Guangdong military and political leaders, starting with Li Han-hun, will issue a circular telegram in the coming days to denounce [Wang Jingwei] and will declare in the telegram their determination to counterattack Guangzhou and eliminate the traitors and rebels in South China. Guangdong military leaders are optimistic about the prospects of the war, and morale is greatly boosted. Fifty-four organizations in Hong Kong issued a joint telegram today to condemn [Wang Jingwei]. (Special dispatch at 12:00 PM on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Central Government does not intend to make any further statements regarding [Wang] Jingwei, taking pity on his temporary delusion and hoping he will repent and return to the country. Some young Central Committee members and military figures advocate for a public order for his arrest, which is under consideration by the Central Government. Feng Yuxiang said that [Wang] Jingwei has gone mad. He knew this long ago and regrets that Sun Fengming's assassination attempt in the past failed. A bronze statue should now be cast for Sun. (Special dispatch at 7:00 PM on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) As a result of the dismissal and expulsion of [Wang] Jingwei from the party, there may be a major political reshuffle next week. It is rumored that the position of Deputy Director-General of the Kuomintang will be given to a well-known leftist leader or a non-communist leader of the Communist Party, which may bring the Communist Party closer to the Kuomintang. According to political circles here, this would further demonstrate the unity of the Chinese people. The defection of Wang [Jingwei] caused temporary panic among political circles here, but they quickly calmed down, and the political institutions showed no signs of weakness. The diplomatic community in Chongqing has been closely monitoring the overall situation. It is now claimed that Wang's escape has actually strengthened the authority of the National Government. Although Wang has the support of some people, they are greatly disturbed by the bizarre policies now being pursued. Many have recently left him. An observer told a Reuters reporter that the government is better off without Wang than with him, as Wang is weak, incompetent, and indecisive. The government's swift announcement of Wang's crimes will greatly stabilize public sentiment. Most Chinese and foreign observers studying the current political situation do not believe that Wang will join the new regime in Nanjing or Beiping and rashly combine with a dangerous speculative attempt. The Chinese here believe that if Wang does this, he will have no basis for success. They believe that Wang may now be hiding in a convenient location to observe changes in the overall situation. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong Journalists Association held a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees and resolved to support the Central Government's determination to fight to the end and oppose Wang's proposal for peace talks. A declaration will be issued in the coming days. (Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Manila The overseas Chinese communities in the Philippines jointly telegraphed Chairman Lin [Sen] and Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek] on the 3rd, supporting the expulsion of Wang Zhaoming from the party and the continuation of the war of resistance, and opposing compromise midway. (Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Various organizations in Hong Kong telegraphed Chairman Lin [Sen] and President Chiang [Kai-shek] on the 2nd, saying, "To Chairman Lin and President Chiang: As the situation in the war of resistance is improving, Wang Zhaoming suddenly issued the fallacious argument of seeking peace, the content of which is directly echoing [Japanese Prime Minister] Konoe's words, shaking people's hearts and confusing the public. This will lead our divine descendants into an irrecoverable abyss. Upon hearing the news, we are extremely indignant. Even after the withdrawal from Wuhan, the enemy has not been able to defeat our main forces. Britain and the United States have lent us huge sums of money. The international situation is clearly unfavorable to the enemy. The enemy knows that military force is not enough to conquer China, so they want to destroy us politically by colluding with shameless and unprincipled people in our country to achieve their divisive goals. Now, the Central Government has clearly ordered the expulsion of Wang Zhaoming from the party and relieved him of his duties. The government's determination to resist the war has become even stronger, and the people's faith in the government has become even more solid. Our association, etc., sincerely supports the government's proposal to eliminate domestic reactionaries and carry out the war of resistance to the end, in order to achieve the final victory. We respectfully report this by telegram, hoping for your careful consideration." The Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association, Hong Kong Chinese Women's Association, Hong Kong Women's New Movement Association, China Youth Ambulance Corps, Motorcycle Research General Union, etc., kowtow. (Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to official sources, telegrams are now pouring in from all parts of China and overseas, supporting the government's decision to expel Wang Jingwei from the party. The public believes that the government's swift and severe handling of Wang's defection has eliminated all kinds of rumors caused by Wang's departure from Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department Urges the People Not to Be Lenient</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Central Propaganda Department issued a public statement on the 1st regarding Wang Zhaoming's absurd remarks, adding corrections. On that day, because the Central Executive Committee had not yet made a decision to expel him from the party, the statement only expressed regret in addition to refuting Wang Zhaoming's absurd remarks. This statement could not be sent to the newspapers for publication on the evening of the 1st, so it was published in the newspapers on the 2nd together with the resolution of the Central Executive Committee on the 2nd. However, this statement slightly contradicted the resolution of the Central Executive Committee. Now, it is reiterated that since the Central Executive Committee has resolved that Wang Zhaoming's actions are a violation of party discipline and endanger the party and the country, and has decided to expel him from the party forever and remove him from all positions, all comrades of the party and all compatriots across the country should abide by this resolution, rectify discipline, and not be lenient in the slightest. It must be known that abiding by national laws and adhering to party discipline is the foundation of our party's revolutionary spirit and the primary condition for winning the war of resistance and building the country. All comrades of the party and all compatriots across the country must deeply understand this. The above document was issued later, so it is necessary to provide a solemn explanation regarding the timing. This is a special statement. (Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Central News Agency, the official Chinese news agency here, published yesterday Wang Jingwei's declaration issued from Hong Kong, which called on the Chinese government to accept the peace proposal of Japanese Prime Minister Konoe. Government officials can see the attitude toward this declaration in the decision to expel [Wang Jingwei] from the party and remove him from various positions. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Ye Chucang Appointed Minister of Propaganda</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Central Government has appointed Ye Chucang as Minister of Propaganda to succeed Zhou Fohai, who has been vacated. According to recent news, Zhou has followed Wang Jingwei from Kunming to Hanoi. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A certain important figure in the Kuomintang told an Associated Press reporter that Wang Jingwei was the leader of the Reorganization Clique seven or eight years ago and has always opposed the policies of the central government. Later, Wang served in important central positions, and the Reorganization Clique dissolved imperceptibly. Young people who supported the Reorganization Clique joined other political groups, so the Reorganization Clique has disappeared from the Chinese political stage. In recent years, Wang has had no supporters, only a few private followers, such as Chen Gongbo, Zeng Zhongming, and Chu Minyi. When Wang served as President of the Executive Yuan three years ago, they all held important positions. Now, all three are in Hong Kong, assisting Wang in his work. In addition to these three, there are more than a dozen other followers. It is decided that part of the reason Wang escaped from Chongqing was that he had lost power and had no supporters. At the same time, Wang himself has many shortcomings, as do his followers. Today, official circles formally acknowledged the news of the arrest of Wang's party members. According to Kuomintang personnel, Wang Jingwei has no party members at all, only a few followers. (Associated Press dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Newspapers in Chongqing Unanimously Condemn Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>(Chongqing) After Wang Jingwei appealed to the Chinese government to accept Japan's peace terms, the newspapers here unanimously condemned him, calling him a "traitor." The Communist Party's organ, "Xinhua Daily," declared that Wang Zhaoming, the former Chairman of the Central Political Council, has now betrayed the people. His departure will only strengthen the forces of resistance. "Xinshu Daily" said that Wang is a "lowly person." The military organ, "Saodang Daily," said that Wang's "actions are shameless and his crimes are unforgivable." (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, all Chinese newspapers unanimously supported the Central Government's measures to expel Wang Jingwei from the party and remove him from various positions. The military organ, "Saodang Daily," stated that Wang's treasonous actions are unforgivable. "Xinshu Daily" stated that Wang's behavior is despised by the Chinese people. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing's Central Daily News today called in an editorial for the death penalty for traitors and those who betray the country, while advocating for honoring heroes who defend the country. The newspaper said that the government's decision to expel Wang Jingwei from the party and dismiss him from his post is the most important thing in the New Year because such measures can strengthen China's determination to resist the war. (Associated Press dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Wang Made Meticulous Plans Before Leaving Chongqing</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to government officials here, Wang Jingwei meticulously planned his departure from Chongqing more than a month ago. At that time, Wang's son, who was studying at Nankai University in Kunming, suddenly left school. Before Wang himself left Chongqing, his family and secretaries had already taken their luggage and books to Hanoi, leaving only one servant at the Chongqing residence. This shows his determination not to return here. Yesterday, it was formally announced that Wang had been expelled from the party and removed from all his positions. Chinese newspapers unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support. Although the newspapers expressed regret for Wang, they said that neither the government nor the country had suffered any damage. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Newspapers here reported today that Wang Jingwei boarded the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso to Shanghai and then Nanjing before issuing his declaration on December 30, but this news could not be confirmed by responsible parties. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The stock exchange here was closed yesterday, so there is no sign of the impact of Wang Jingwei's declaration on Far Eastern public bonds. The newspapers did not pay special attention to the declaration. Some newspapers did not even publish a single word, and the general opinion is that Wang's declaration will prove to be a "damp squib." The Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, told a Reuters reporter yesterday that this matter is regrettable, but it has no effect on China's solemnly announced policy. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Chinese newspapers here this morning all claimed that Wang Jingwei had taken the Italian liner Conte Rosso to Shanghai on December 29. However, the reporter recently learned from well-informed sources that Wang did not go to Shanghai and is still in a certain area of Guangdong Province, colluding with a group of frustrated Chinese military officers, planning to first establish a pro-Japanese puppet regime in Guangdong. It is also rumored that Wang is currently lobbying the Japanese to withdraw Japanese troops from Guangzhou. It is said that the Japanese may accept Wang's request, but the Japanese will still leave a small number of troops to defend the military strongholds outside Guangzhou. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Support the Central Government's Policy</p>
<p>After Wang Zhaoming's telegram was published in Hong Kong, telegrams denouncing Wang have been received from overseas. In Singapore, after the news of Wang's advocacy of peace talks spread, overseas Chinese were extremely indignant. The press openly attacked Wang, and anti-Wang slogans were found on the streets. The attitude of overseas Chinese in Manila is also the same, unanimously supporting the Central Government's policy. Foreigners here have shown no expression toward Wang's advocacy of peace talks. The anti-Wang attitude of overseas Chinese in Batavia is very active. (Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>The Chongqing Branch of the Kuomintang in Siam and the General Branch in the Philippines telegraphed the Director-General, supporting the war of resistance to the end. The two telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) The Overseas Department of the Chongqing Central Party Headquarters relayed to Director-General Chiang: The enemy's dream of a quick victory has been shattered by our loyal and brave soldiers at the front. These despicable creatures, without remorse, are making a desperate gamble to indulge their ferocity by invading Guangzhou. The news has stirred up extreme indignation among overseas Chinese. According to resolutions of the affiliated organizations, we all support our wise leader in long-term resistance to recover the lost territories and protect the survival of our Republic of China to comfort the millions of overseas Chinese in Siam. We respectfully pray for victory and wish you peace. The Chongqing Branch of the Kuomintang in Siam, the General Association of Overseas Chinese Supporting National Salvation in Siam. (2) To Director-General Chiang: The East Celebrates the Founding Anniversary of the Republic of China Grand Assembly unanimously resolved to support your declaration of fighting to the end. We respectfully send this telegram in salute. The General Branch and affiliated organizations in the Philippines kowtow together. (Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Answering Readers' Questions—The Wang Jingwei Affair—</h3>
<p>Regarding the Wang Jingwei affair, this newspaper has repeatedly condemned his arrogance and absurdity, and all parties agree and deeply resent his perversity. Occasionally, some pity his life experience, but none show him any sympathy. Modern philosophical theories have flourished, and people often lament the lack of moral standards and the absence of theoretical laws when discussing people and events. In fact, the distinction between right and wrong, and the division between extreme good and evil, must be based on the common understanding of all people, becoming an indelible principle. The speed and strictness of public opinion's response leave no room for compromise, just as black and white are known at a glance without thinking, and as fragrant and foul odors are distinguished at a touch without examination. Therefore, Wang Jingwei's words and actions are despised by the world, and his self-destruction can almost be regarded as a settled conclusion, which does not need to be discussed further. However, a reader questioned the reporter with several questions, which were quite meaningful. I will recount them as follows.</p>
<p>The reader asked: "Everyone unanimously condemns Wang Jingwei's perversity and absurdity. In the midst of passionate resistance, such a reaction is natural. However, the matter is something that common sense would not allow. Could it be that he is not as good as ordinary people? Perhaps he has some profound reasons worthy of our humble study? He is in the central government and has more immediate knowledge than the common people. Could it be that he has seen through some weaknesses in the military resistance that led him to surrender first in order to save himself? He has long been known as a veteran of the party and the country, and his faction has long been established. Could it be that his wings have grown strong enough that he has gained enough influence to hold the country hostage or to offer something to the enemy? Now that the spirit of solidarity has been split in this way, will the forces of resistance be weakened somewhat? Wang Jingwei is not completely foolish. If he did not have some confidence, how could he rashly commit such a great injustice to the world? All these questions have not been addressed in this newspaper's previous discussions. Please enlighten me."</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's recent words and actions are comparable to the Xi'an Incident in December 1936. Both violated public opinion, went against the tide of events, and were extremely strange on the surface, outside of normal emotions and reason. Both failed to measure their virtue and abilities and were driven by their desire for leadership. Both妄想号召有众，卒为万众共弃之独夫, which I am unsure of how to translate but will offer the raw pinyin: "Wang xiang hao zhao you zhong, zu wei wan zhong gong qi zhi du fu." Both revealed their madness in the guise of profoundity. These similarities make the two events quite similar.</p>
<p>At the time of the Xi'an Incident, everyone thought it was mysterious and vicious. After analysis, those who knew better laughed at it. Wang Jingwei's achievement will only amount to material for future generations to laugh at. Wang is a narrow-minded person who holds stubborn opinions about people and things and cannot tolerate others. He secretly considers himself a genius. Therefore, after he had a start in politics, his knowledge made no further progress. Fundamentally, he is not a great man, and he is blinded by his own intelligence. Therefore, he only has the possibility of lacking common sense and has no opportunity to nurture profound insights. Take his previous criticisms of the scorched-earth policy and guerrilla warfare as examples to prove the depth of his prejudices and his inability to progress. Furthermore, read Chairman Chiang's instruction on the 26th and Wang Jingwei's telegram on the 29th to know that the telegram has no research value. As for China's military affairs, they have always been planned and directed by Chairman Chiang. Those who participate in some military affairs only know some of the actual situation, and those who do not participate in military affairs know nothing. This is because military affairs are very different from politics. Politics is open and honest, and one can see the big picture from the small. Military affairs do not consider deception immoral, but consider absolute secrecy a condition for success. Now that those in charge of military affairs have confidence in winning the war, no one has the right to deny this confidence. Since they know nothing and have no qualifications, they still raise their heads and stretch their eyebrows, as if they are about to "sell the wind, clouds, thunder, and rain." What true knowledge and insight do they have? All one sees is their duplicity. As for the existence of certain factions and groups, this is a fact. However, those who call themselves parties or groups based on ideology have already returned to the banner of the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People in order to resist the war. Therefore, these so-called factions and groups must have no meaning for the benefit of the country and the well-being of the people. It is believed that in recent years, Chairman Chiang's sincerity has moved those who are capable to dedicate themselves to the country and obey the leader. Therefore, the factions and groups of the past have gradually disappeared. This is certainly true in the military. Given Wang Jingwei's narrow-minded character, his lack of progress in knowledge, and his repeated reversals over the past decade, he has long been disbelieved by the talented and knowledgeable, let alone the masses. Those who follow him for the sake of rank and wealth certainly exist, but what kind of people are they? They are incapable and without power. To say that they can influence events is either a self-deception of being pretentious or a deception of others. Chongqing has resolved to expel him from the party, and Tokyo has not yet expressed its desire to recruit a traitor. Therefore, although Wang Jingwei is very self-important and seeks to save himself, his objective evaluation is very minor. How much damage does his rebellion cause to China's war of resistance? Then, is Wang Jingwei not completely foolish? He believed that the telegram on the 29th would lead the Chinese people to regard him as the national leader, the puppet regimes in the north and south would welcome him as the head of state, the Japanese government and public would respect him as a representative of a friendly country, and Germany, Italy, Britain, and France would praise him as the god of peace. Isn't this a great imagination? It is no accident that he dreamed of making a splash; however it was an event that turned out to be a "damp squib!" Who would have expected that?</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Response to the Far East Situation: Considering Economic Pressure on Japan, Believing Japan's Weak Financial Position Makes it Easy to Succeed, US Public Opinion Tending Towards Further Action</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here have recently stated that after Ambassador Craigie's decisive talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita regarding the protection of British interests in China yielded no results, and as anxieties in the United States regarding its interests in China have also increased, the British Foreign Office is considering retaliatory measures against Japanese commerce by both Britain and the United States, and the two sides are exchanging opinions. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the protection of interests in China, the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, which yielded no results. The Foreign Office authorities have already considered countermeasures, generally believing that directly pressuring Japan to change its attitude is unlikely to succeed. It is more appropriate to apply retaliatory measures to Japanese commerce within the territories of the British Empire. Britain can inflict significant blows on Japanese commerce in its territories without resorting to illegal means. The US government has reportedly expressed no objection to taking retaliatory measures in the economic sphere. As such, the final decision of the British government will inevitably be influenced by the attitude of the United States. Information received here from Tokyo also confirms two things: (1) Japan's economic situation is increasingly difficult, and (2) Japan's military position in China is not as strong as described in its official announcements. Furthermore, the pro-peace telegram from Wang Jingwei is not taken seriously here, as it is not believed to have any impact on General Chiang Kai-shek personally or on the future of the war. Therefore, if Britain desires fair treatment for its interests in China, it can take economic action, and such action is likely to succeed due to Japan's economic vulnerability. It goes without saying. The detailed plan is being carefully studied by the relevant departments of the Foreign Office, and will be submitted for review when Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax return to London (at the end of this week). However, thorough consideration can only be given after the Prime Minister's visit to Rome and the Foreign Secretary's attendance at the League of Nations Council meeting (opening on the 16th of this month). (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to sources here, the US government intends to submit to Congress various materials demonstrating the extent to which the Japanese military discriminates against American commerce in the occupied territories of China. Subsequent actions will be determined by the strength of the sentiment expressed by Congress and the nation. (According to reliable sources obtained by Reuters, President Roosevelt will not exercise the powers granted to him by Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 unless he feels that the entire nation supports it. However, if the public entrusts him with this power, the government is prepared to implement a retaliatory plan. This clause authorizes the President to impose high tariffs on imports from any country that discriminates against American commerce, and even to prohibit the entry of goods from other countries carried by vessels of the discriminating country. If the other party continues to discriminate after implementing such measures, the President has the right to prohibit all trade with that country. It is said that a few years ago, a European country discriminated against American commerce, and the United States only made this threat, and the country immediately ceased its discrimination. At that time, the proposed order was shown to the ambassador of that country, who telegraphed it to his home government, and they then yielded. According to reliable sources, the US government does not want to take such drastic steps immediately, but responsible sources claim that if American public opinion remains strong against this repeatedly provocative behavior, the government will not hesitate to go to extremes, especially because American commerce, educational, and charitable undertakings in the Japanese-occupied areas of China are still being deliberately damaged by the Japanese.

<p>Pittman's Statement</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the issue of maintaining the Nine-Power Treaty in Washington, after the US government presented two resolute notes to Japan, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also made a statement to the press, saying, "If Japan does not provide a satisfactory reply, the US government will impose retaliatory measures on that country, especially prohibiting the import of Japanese goods into the United States. According to the current tariff law, President Roosevelt already has the power to issue such a ban, and can also request that Congress pass a resolution prohibiting the export of American goods to Japan to achieve complete success." The Japanese side may retaliate in some way, such as severing diplomatic relations with the United States, but will not declare war on the United States. "We know very well that Japan cannot invade our country from across the Pacific Ocean," he said. Although Pittman's statement was made in his personal capacity, well-informed sources believe that if Japan cannot provide a satisfactory reply, the US attitude will definitely become increasingly tough, which can be seen from this statement. In addition, Pittman's statement was made on the eve of the resumption of Congress, and its special importance is self-evident. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Britain Will Follow in America's Footsteps</p>
<p>(London) The British Foreign Office is considering sending a note to Tokyo similar to the US note of December 31 as a final note. The content of the US note to Japan rejects any unilateral settlement of the China issue by Japan and proposes inviting Japan to participate in an international conference to jointly seek a solution to the Far East problem. According to British sources, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie recently discussed the issues in the US note to Japan with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Officials here said, "We fully sympathize with the US note and believe that this note has been designated as 'final' by the Washington authorities." In addition, the main points of the US note to Japan are divided into three main points: (1) The United States refuses to recognize any unilateral settlement of the China issue by Japan; (2) The United States invites Japan to participate in an international conference to jointly seek a solution to the Far East problem with the major powers concerned with China; (3) The United States will, regardless of any announcements by the Japanese government or Japanese puppet organizations in China, reserve all rights and interests of Americans in China. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) The British newspapers attach great importance to the recent US note to Japan. The Washington correspondent of "The Times" said that when the note was released to the American newspapers, it was accompanied by a notice stating, "This note must be regarded as a fundamental summary of all disputes in previous notes from the United States." This article aims to end the empty talk on this matter. The Washington correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" also said that American officials are increasingly feeling that in order to deal with the current situation, there must be more action beyond "non-recognition." What the United States does not recognize is Japan's right to establish a new order in China. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Full Text of the US Note to Japan</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The United States previously sent a very long and strongly worded note to the Japanese government on October 6 of last year, because Japan violated the principle of the Open Door and Equal Opportunity in China. Japan replied on November 18 of last year, still arguing sophistically. The US side believed that it was not satisfactory, and sent another note to Japan on the 31st of last month, reiterating the views of the US government. The reports in the newspapers these days have been very brief. Now, the reporter translates and publishes the original telegram of this note, which was forwarded by the relevant parties. Even if there are still some omissions, it should not be far from the full text of the note.</p>
<p>The note stated, "It is undoubtedly true that the Japanese side has restricted the actions and business operations of the American people, placed the interests of the Japanese in a superior position, and discriminated against the legitimate interests of the American side. The US government firmly believes that restricting businesses, such as foreign exchange controls, mandatory circulation of banknotes, and revising tariffs, as well as advocating monopolies regardless of the elimination of rights already acquired by other countries, are neither fair nor just, and violate the provisions of certain international agreements. The Japanese side has repeatedly guaranteed to respect the principle of equal opportunity, and Japan has also undertaken the obligation to abide by this principle in treaties. The US government has therefore requested the Japanese side to abide by this obligation and fulfill its guarantees in practice. The Japanese government's reply seems to make the US government's understanding of the new situation and new order planned and created by the Japanese authorities in East Asia a condition for respecting the aforementioned principle. This kind of arbitrary assumption that the US government should recognize the new situation and new order claimed by the Japanese authorities as valid in order for the American people to enjoy the general rights they have already acquired in China without discriminatory treatment is questionable. The American people's compliance with and advocacy of the principle of equal opportunity is not only for obtaining commercial benefits, but also for hoping to obtain economic and political stability, so as to eliminate international friction and malice and open up trade routes. However, this principle has been clearly agreed to by the Japanese side in the past, and has been recognized in various international agreements and international understandings for a long time. The US government and people cannot agree to any third country unilaterally creating a system for various special purposes to forcibly cancel its long-acquired rights to equal opportunity and fair treatment. The US government and people enjoy the aforementioned various legitimate and fair rights together with the governments and people of other countries, and the basic principles such as equal opportunity have long been recognized as good, fair, and natural principles and have been universally adopted, so they cannot be invalidated by unilateral statements. The Japanese government's note implies that past ideas and principles need to be modified in light of the current and future situation in the Far East. The US government now wishes to reiterate to the Japanese government its views on amending the agreement. The US government and people believe that when a certain situation involves the rights, obligations, and legitimate interests of other sovereign countries, no country has the right to arbitrarily implement its intentions without the consent of all the countries concerned. Treaties have provisions for amending clauses. Therefore, the United States cannot recognize the fact that one of the parties to the agreement, as expressed by the actions and official statements of its officials, is unwilling to abide by the promises of the treaty and the vested rights of other countries, and attempts to arbitrarily take measures to create a new order in the Far East. No matter what changes have occurred in the past, or what the current situation is, the US government is equally concerned about the situation that existed in the past, and the changes that may occur in the future, even if these changes may promote a new situation and a new order, are equally of concern to the US government now and in the future. The US government is also aware that some changes have been created by the Japanese side, but the US government cannot recognize that any country arbitrarily stipulates the conditions and circumstances of a new order in areas outside its sovereignty and considers itself the source of power and the master of fate in that area. Restrictions on tariff autonomy and extraterritoriality have been separately removed through negotiations and agreements due to changes in the situation, and are being removed. The US government has always believed that agreements can be amended, but it always insists that it can only be done through the legal procedures of negotiation and agreement. The Japanese government has also repeatedly held the same view. All rights and obligations of the United States in international relations originate from international law and are generated based on treaties concluded in good faith. The US government and people cannot agree to the arbitrary actions of officials or authorities of third countries to cancel any rights and obligations of the United States. However, the US government has always been and is still prepared to give considerable and full consideration to any suggestions based on justice and law and proposed by the countries concerned through free negotiation and re-acceptance, so as to solve various problems and give due consideration to the rights and obligations of all countries concerned. The Japanese government inherently and now has the opportunity to make such proposals. If such proposals are made by representatives of other countries whose rights and obligations are related, including China and Japan, the US government has been and is still willing to engage in discussions anywhere. At the same time, the US government reserves all current American rights, and will never agree to those rights being infringed upon." (Dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Sexual Health</p>
<h3>Weakness of the Kidneys Is...</h3>
<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical Department</p>
<p>The Destroyer of Family Peace</p>
<p>Do you want to build a fulfilling family? To give birth to healthy offspring? To grow old together with your spouse? The first condition is that you must pay attention to the physical and mental health of both parties. If the health status of both family lines is not thoroughly investigated before marriage, and one of the spouses develops health problems after marriage, various tragedies will inevitably occur—the most unfortunate divorce between couples, although the reasons are very complex, what particularly attracts our attention is the neurasthenia of the kidneys between couples. No matter how passionate their love is, once this condition occurs, their love will naturally cool down, and the peace of the family will naturally be shattered. Not only that, even if both spouses are healthy—the kidney function is not abnormal—they cannot fully obtain the joy of nature, and the result is that there is no possibility of giving birth to healthy successors. Such a family, filled with gloomy, silent atmosphere, is the supreme suffering in life!</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to seek family happiness and the joy of life, we must pay full attention to the outbreak of this disease. If one or both spouses have impaired kidney function, we must quickly correct it with medical knowledge. Then, this sexual knowledge is indispensable for anyone.</p>
<p>Post-marital kidney dysfunction can generally be divided into three types: disease-related, age-related, and spousal fatigue. The so-called disease-related factors are purely due to excessive masturbation before marriage, and debauchery, leading to underdevelopment, kidney atrophy, and other diseases. The second is sexual dysfunction due to age, which is most common in middle-aged husbands. Because the youth glands that govern the kidneys gradually decrease in vitality with age, middle-aged men have weaker interest and enthusiasm for marital relations than young people. If they indulge in lust during their youth, they will lose this natural function in middle age. As for marital fatigue, it is often caused by disagreements between the two parties or dissatisfaction with the other's appearance. Therefore, this is most common in young people who are fond of novelty and tire of the old, and whose love is not dedicated. Consequently, the greatest happiness and joy of living together as a couple cannot be fully enjoyed!</p>
<p>In summary, there are many reasons for post-marital kidney dysfunction, but the most common is pathological reasons. Therefore, the most important treatment method is to increase essence and nourish blood. Unfortunately, the preparations on the market all claim to treat sexual neurasthenia, and patients and doctors are confused about how to choose. In particular, the ingredients in tonic drugs are mostly temporary stimulants, which cause many problems after use. Therefore, if one does not think about safe and fundamental treatment, but wants a permanent solution, one must choose preparations made from the essence of the testicles of truly strong animals, which can produce miraculous effects. I especially like to use "Complimenton" from Germany. This preparation is made entirely from the youth gland extracts of chimpanzees, cattle, and sheep, and is infused with mineral and plant ingredients that nourish the brain and blood, so the effect is the best. It is indeed a great savior for those with kidney atrophy!</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission Requires Immediate Treatment!</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany</p>
<p>All diseases have their causes. There is a cause and an effect. And when the symptoms appear, they often become the cause in reverse. For example, nocturnal emission leads to kidney deficiency. And those with kidney deficiency are less able to control their essence, and nocturnal emission becomes more frequent. Those who suffer from neurasthenia due to kidney deficiency experience frequent nocturnal emissions because the neurasthenia causes the fire of the gate of vitality to become excessive, and desires are difficult to control, even to the point of spermatorrhea with the slightest stimulation. The first step in treating this disease is to stop the nocturnal emission. Therefore, one should start by strengthening the spermatic cord. "Ners' Nocturnal Emission Pills," invented by the German venereal disease expert Ners, are a specific medicine for fundamentally curing nocturnal emission. Further taking "Complimenton" to nourish the deficiencies and eliminate neurasthenia will eradicate all kinds of weakness like sweeping away fallen leaves in an instant. Speaking of the efficacy of the "Ners' Nocturnal Emission Pills," after repeated trials, I have found them to be unmatched by other preparations.</p>

<h3>Ironclad Fact: The Test Tube Experiment for Gonorrhea Medication</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States</p>
<p>Many old gonorrhea treatments have been proven ineffective by modern expert doctors and patients. Therefore, the research on new treatments is rampant in the entire medical community. Scholars bury themselves in work, exhausting countless efforts and brainpower. Finally, a truth for treating gonorrhea was discovered in the test tube, which shocked the entire medical world for a time. It is generally believed to be the greatest harvest in the treatment of gonorrhea. At that time, I was studying medicine in the United States, determined to study and read widely in medical journals published in Europe and the United States. I learned that it was a new method based on the latest science, which extracted pure pigments and protein bodies, and mixed them with other mild but powerful bactericidal chemicals to make a solution. When used to soak gonococci, the gonococci were seen to die quickly.</p>
<p>Many scholars, such as Dr. Jauregg (1912), Dr. R. Rrans (1914.1917), and Dr. R. Schmidt (1916), who are all university professors and gonorrhea specialists, have also repeatedly tested the agent and proved its great effectiveness. The gonococci in the slant culture medium in the test tube are usually very active and lively. If this medicinal solution is injected into the test tube, all the gonococci are immediately seen to die. Later, Dr. Peter took it a step further and made the pure yellow pigment and special protein bodies into an oral medicine "Kelinnong" using precise disinfection procedures. From then on, the treatment of gonorrhea opened a new world.</p>
<p>This medicine can fundamentally cure all kinds of acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, such as acute and chronic balanitis, prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, and arthritis in men, and vulvitis, vaginitis, cervicitis, oophoritis, and gonorrheal leukorrhea in women. Its speed and accuracy have long been praised. If women have gonorrheal leukorrhea, they can use "Carols Shetti Vaginal Tablets" as a suppository, inserting one tablet into the vagina every night before going to bed and washing it off the next morning. Men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, washing the urethra according to the instructions and illustrations, and secretly treating themselves at home. The speed of the effect will surely exceed expectations, and it is better than treatment at a general doctor's office. This is the conclusion I have reached from my clinical experience over the past ten years. (Note: "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is sold at both Zhongxi Taihe Drugstore)</p>
<h3>The Story of Lung Disease Recovery</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Today's lung disease treatment, in European countries, pulmonary relaxation therapy is popular. According to expert reports, after taking "Shenfei Nael" orally, it can indeed achieve the above-mentioned purpose, because the basis for the preparation of this medicine is based on this rule. Therefore, after taking it, the lungs are relaxed in three hours, the cavities are contracted, and as a result, the therapeutic bacteria lose their range of activity and die one after another. Therefore, no matter what stage of lung disease, even if it reaches the final stage, the power of "Bufei Nael" will make the appetite increase, breathing smooth, and cough, night fever, and night sweats will all disappear without a trace.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Yima Constellation</h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road Treatment after the disappearance of acute gonorrhea symptoms</p>
<p>If gonorrhea can be treated early, it can avoid a long period of difficult and distressed life, but unfortunately, if gonorrhea is not treated properly in the early stage (acute stage), and it becomes chronic gonorrhea, it is also a blessing in disguise for gonorrhea patients if they can receive appropriate treatment from a formal doctor. However, the most taboo thing is to think that the disease has become chronic, and then give up on oneself and refuse to seek effective treatment. As a result, it will inevitably become chronic gonorrhea and become a lifelong burden. Can you not plan for it early?</p>
<p>The so-called treatment after the disappearance of acute gonorrhea symptoms means that appropriate treatment is applied after the acute symptoms of gonorrhea gradually disappear, so as to avoid turning into chronic gonorrhea. After the second or third week of acute gonorrhea, all the symptoms of thought, such as the gradual disappearance of pain, and the gradual recovery of secretions and inflammation, are relieved. At that time, the patient only sees thick purulent secretions at the urethral opening in the early morning.</p>
<p>During this period, a higher concentration of Protargolum should be used, followed by German static electricity therapy and oral gonorrhea medicine "Kelinnong" to make the patient's cells produce anti-gonorrhea phagocytic effects, and at the same time, after these therapies, because the medicine exerts a bactericidal effect, there must be a decision to secrete pus, but this is a necessary condition for treating gonorrhea. When I treat this disease, I always explain it to the patient in advance, so when I apply it, the patient does not find it strange. For example, Mr. Nie Yiwu, who lives on North Xizang Road. He originally suffered from acute gonorrhea, but the treatment was not effective, so he was not completely cured. He begged me to treat him. After I applied the above-mentioned medicines and therapies and explained the situation after the medicine, he happily obeyed. After the second week, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" was used to kill gonococci and exert an anti-inflammatory effect, so that the re-emergence of epithelial cells, three weeks of treatment, urination was clear, and all other symptoms were completely cured. Consultation hours are from 10 am to 6 pm From today onwards, send 20 numbers for consultation every day, and each number only costs 5 cents</p>
<h3>Cabinet Turmoil in Japan: Konoe Prepares to Step Down; Hiranuma Most Popular Choice to Succeed; Suetsugu's Political Mobilization Plan Hits a Wall</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to well-informed sources here, Prime Minister Konoe has decided to submit his cabinet's resignation this week due to the outcome of the year-end multi-decision conference. Baron Kiichirō Hiranuma, President of the Privy Council, is the most likely candidate to succeed him. It is said that the reason for the cabinet turmoil stems from Interior Minister Suetsugu's insistence on a national political mobilization based on his own ideas. Suetsugu is known for his fascist tendencies, and if his proposed plan were adopted, all political parties would be merged into one. While both the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties support a national spiritual mobilization, they strongly oppose Suetsugu's plan. It is rumored that Suetsugu has threatened to forcibly dissolve the Diet. If that happens, the ordinary budget and the 6 billion yuan budget for the Sino-Japanese War will not be passed by the Diet, which would cause great financial chaos in Japan during wartime. For this reason, Konoe prefers to resign before the Diet reconvenes on January 24. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting of the year tomorrow. According to observers here, the plan to strengthen the Japanese cabinet will be realized within a day or two. (3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to informed sources, government leaders here have been consulting each other busily in recent days, and this will continue this week. Although no specific facts have been disclosed, it is widely believed that this is related to the imminent cabinet reshuffle. It is rumored that a necessary decision will be made before the 10th of this month. In addition to the heads of the defense departments, Finance Minister Ikeda, the Minister of Education, and the Minister of Health and Welfare are also participating in the discussions. However, Interior Minister Suetsugu is not involved. According to observers, the President of the Privy Council has held several talks with the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal in recent days. The Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal represents the Emperor and Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe and other cabinet members, and conducts talks with them. Political figures solemnly declare that the sole purpose of this cabinet reshuffle is to achieve close contact and unified will among all cabinet members. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Enormous Japanese Military Expenditure; Small Businesses Close Down One After Another; Domestic Unemployment Soars</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese newspapers, the special budget for the next fiscal year, including the war expenses for China, will greatly exceed the current year's figure, equivalent to £59 million. The total amount of the new budget is equivalent to £353 million, compared to £294 million in the previous year. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In 1939, the lives of the Japanese working masses will become even more difficult because the ruling class insists on continuing the protracted war in China. This war has severely damaged Japan's economy, causing tens of thousands of businesses to close down. The number of unemployed has increased to 2 million. Taxes have increased to 4 billion yuan. Various necessities such as textiles, cigarettes, tea, coffee, and soap are all subject to heavy taxes. In 1939, the Japanese working masses will have to bear 6 billion yuan in military expenses for the invasion of China, while also having to drastically reduce their consumption of goods.

<h3>China's Resistance War Becomes More United; British Newspapers Optimistic About the Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>(London) Today, newspapers here are more optimistic about the situation in the Far East. A Financial Times editorial states that the increasingly firm attitude of the United States towards Japan and the granting of credit for the purchase of goods gives those whose financial and commercial interests in China are currently harmed the hope that the US government will eventually take a tougher stance. The US credit line, following the British loan, is particularly important from the perspective of the Chinese people's spirit of resistance, even though the amount is not large. Without this kind of assistance, Wang Jingwei's advocacy of peace with Japan would be more powerful. However, as the situation is constantly changing and the war is still ongoing, British and American assistance should be swift. To maintain the key factors of the Chinese government and the Open Door Policy, those whose interests are affected must carefully consider this position and act quickly. The Birmingham Post claims that, according to the information it has obtained, the Japanese believe that Wang Jingwei's defection is the starting point for the collapse of Chinese unity. This is purely wishful thinking on the part of the Japanese. In fact, Wang Jingwei's departure can strengthen the unity of the government, and there is no sign that China's spirit of resistance has been affected by his telegrams. According to the observers' recent impressions, China's determination to resist has been strengthened by the economic assistance from Britain and the United States. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Criticize the International Situation; The Far East and Europe Compared</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The main issues commented on by the German newspapers in the New Year are two: the Mediterranean problem and the Far East dispute. The "Berliner Tageblatt" compares the Spanish Civil War with the Far East dispute, stating, "All parties hope that the Spanish problem can be resolved as soon as possible. When British Prime Minister Chamberlain goes to Rome in mid-month to talk with the Italian authorities, he will use this issue as the starting point for the talks. As for the Far East, the Japanese side has declared this year as the 'Year of Diplomacy', which is evidenced by the fact that Wang Jingwei and Doihara have begun negotiations, which they believe to be reliable." At this point, the newspaper further states, "Jewish capitalism and Bolshevik revolution are both conspiring in the world." This is the world's first crisis. The nations of Europe have awakened, and the Far East is also showing signs of awakening. There is no need for Western countries to give instructions. On the contrary, the dark forces in the Americas want to use the torch in the hand of the Statue of Liberty in New York to ignite a prairie fire around the world. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<h3>A Coffin Sent to the British Prime Minister's Residence; But Prevented by the Police; Unemployed Masses Call for Relief</h3>
<p>(London) Participants in the National Unemployed Workers' Movement today attempted to deliver a coffin containing an umbrella to the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, but were prevented by the police. As the clock struck, a large car with tightly closed doors drove into Downing Street and went directly to the door of the Prime Minister's residence. A person jumped out of the car, went to the door and spoke to the doorman of the residence. At this time, the people in the car carried a coffin out of the car and prepared to carry it into the residence. The coffin was black, painted with white characters that read "The coffin of unemployed people who requested relief in vain." Several policemen saw this, stepped forward, stopped them, and put the coffin back on the car, ordering them to drive away. At the same time, hundreds of unemployed people gathered in Downing Street, loudly demanding winter relief. However, British Prime Minister Chamberlain was spending his New Year holiday at his villa, so he did not witness this commotion. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Radio Broadcasts Pictures and Sound; Television Broadcasts Reach 3,000 Miles Away; - Amazing Achievements of the Scientific Community -</h3>
<p>(London) The British television films broadcast from Alexandra Palace in London can actually be seen and heard in New York. This amazing news was telegraphed to the British Broadcasting Corporation by the New York Jiangtou Radio Station. The company only guarantees that this television broadcast can be received within 25 to 30 miles. Now it can be received as far as 3,000 miles away in New York, which is a rare event in the wireless electricity industry. It is generally believed that this amazing achievement was achieved due to the particularly good weather conditions on that day. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Arrives in Tunis; Inspects North African Defenses; The People Welcome Him Enthusiastically; Corsicans Pledge Loyalty to the Motherland</h3>
<p>French Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier, accompanied by Army Chief of Staff General Georges, Air Force Chief of Staff General Vuillemin, Navy Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Darlan, Commander of the Tunisian Garrison General Blanc, Commander of the Bizerte Fortress Lieutenant General Bréard, and many French and indigenous dignitaries, arrived in Tunis, French North Africa, at 12:15 this afternoon. The residents shouted "Long live France" and "Long live Daladier" repeatedly and for a long time. The cordon set up near the Governor's Office was broken through by the crowd. The enthusiastic welcome of the people can be seen. Prime Minister Daladier then went to the tombs of the war dead to lay wreaths. At 12:40 p.m., he went to the "French Building" to attend a banquet hosted by Governor Labonne. Then, at 3:30 p.m., he inspected the garrison in the city and watched an air show. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bizerte: French Prime Minister Daladier arrived here today from Bastia. Twelve submarines and a flotilla of torpedo boats participated in the welcome. Another squadron of seaplanes soared in the sky. After Daladier landed, the people welcomed him enthusiastically. Indigenous troops lined the streets he passed, and the cheers were deafening. Women threw flowers from the windows to show their respect. After Daladier attended the reception hosted by the local officials, he took a car to inspect a fort on the defense line protecting Bizerte. Daladier will now go to Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, where he will be greeted by 76-year-old Governor Sidi Ahmed. Ahmed will present him with a "Blood Oath Badge," after which Daladier can be called Ahmed's sworn brother. After Daladier conducts a grand review at noon tomorrow, he will inspect the Mareth Line, which protects the Libyan border. France recently dispatched a large number of reinforcements to the Libyan border. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bastia, capital of Corsica: Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier arrived in this port at 3:30 this afternoon aboard the cruiser "Admiral Foch". Navy Minister Campinchi, former cabinet members Pietri and Landri (both Corsicans), and the senators and deputies elected from the island, who came to welcome the Prime Minister from Ajaccio aboard the cruisers "Suffren" and "Colbert", arrived at 3:10 p.m. The chairman of the Bastia City Council, Mondola, and other officials welcomed him at the port. When the Prime Minister landed by boat, the gun salutes and military music sounded in unison. Three young women presented flowers to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister then inspected the troops at the pier. At that time, the military band played the national anthem, and the crowd sang along in unison. The singing was deafening. After twenty minutes, the number of people gathering outside the pier increased, finally breaking through the cordon and rushing into the pier, shouting "Long live France" and "Long live Daladier." At this time, the Prime Minister went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to lay wreaths and observe a moment of silence amidst the thronging crowd. Van Larese, Chairman of the Island Veterans Association, raised his hand and swore, "We swear to live as Corsicans and die as French ghosts." The crowd heard this and shouted in unison, "We swear." Prime Minister Daladier then went to the Municipal Theater to attend a reception. The Chairman of the City Council, Mondola, also delivered a welcoming speech, emphasizing that Corsica and France have an unshakable connection. If France is threatened in its territory or in its colonies, Corsicans are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the country again, as they did in the last World War. The Prime Minister also gave a brief reply, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome of the people, and speaking of national unity. He then re-boarded the cruiser "Admiral Foch" at 5:00 p.m. and transferred to Tunis. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers Accuse France of Deliberate Provocation</h3>
<p>(Rome) Newspapers here have sharply criticized the French Prime Minister's visit to Tunis and Corsica, considering it an anti-Italian demonstration. "Il Regime Fascista" commented, "Daladier does not strive to resolve the differences between the two countries, but instead exacerbates them and goes into a corner." "Il Giornale d'Italia" commented with the headline "Corsica is an Italian Island," saying that the current demonstration cannot change the language, culture, and customs of Corsica, as these have always been related to Italy, just as Tuscany is. Italy disregards and ignores the protests made by France regarding "Latin civilization" and "Latin friendship." This is not only a failure to understand Italy's expectations, but also a deliberate provocation. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Berlin Officials Remain Silent</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Here, attention is being paid to French Prime Minister Daladier's tour of the colonies, but officials are very silent about it, apparently unwilling to make many statements about it at this time. The remarks of a Hamburg newspaper seem to reflect the opinion of the German political world, saying that France's current diplomacy is no different from the past, as it is attempting to create an exaggerated and uncompromising attitude at the beginning in order to gain a favorable position. The relationship between Italy and France has become a European problem. If people overseas can understand the meaning of the clear and unbreakable obligations that have arisen in the German-Italian relationship, that is, what the German leader is currently advocating, then Germany's attitude towards the Mediterranean problem will never be misunderstood.

<h3>Abyssinia Seething with Resentment; Italian Troops Use Force; Not Yet Completely Conquered</h3>
<p>(Paris) A telegram received here from Djibouti, the capital of French Somaliland, states that a movement to boycott Italian goods to protect the economic life of Djibouti seems to be brewing. Transportation managers have received telegram orders to quickly transport all Italian goods to Abyssinia. At the same time, the Italian Consul General in Djibouti has departed for Rome. The local people are currently quite calm, but according to French sources, Abyssinia is seeing its economic life deteriorate due to a lack of cash, and resentment is seething. Apart from a few major centers, the Italian army has not yet been able to conquer Abyssinia. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Germany Demands Naval Expansion; Britain Feels Threatened</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently stated that the German government's attitude is very firm regarding Germany's invocation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 18, 1935, to demand that the total tonnage of submarines be increased to be equal to that of Britain, and its invocation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of July 13, 1937, to demand that the number of capital cruisers be increased from five to seven. It will not allow any concessions and will submit a note within days explaining the reasons and notifying Britain of the measures it has actually taken. In order to deal with this, the British naval authorities are said to have considered the following two methods: (1) building many small warships of 500 to 1,000 tons, equipped with four-inch, seven-caliber cannons, to shoot at submarines or aircraft; (2) building more than 30 submarine defense ships in the next few months. The above two types of small warships will be used to protect commercial routes and to fight against individually operating submarines. In addition, many existing destroyers are being renovated and will also be equipped with new weapons to defend against submarines and aircraft. The details of all these plans will be revealed when the Admiralty publishes its budget in late February or early March. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Turmoil Expected to Be Avoided; Chamberlain Trusts Secretary of War; Factions Unite to Form New Party</h3>
<p>(London) According to Reuters' parliamentary correspondent, the actions of some government supporters who were dissatisfied with the three cabinet members' dissatisfaction with national defense issues at the end of last month seem to have disappeared invisibly. The leaders of this matter were Major Airdmanson, a supporter of the government faction in the Conservative Party, and Marquis Doufflin, a colonial decision official. The reason was dissatisfaction with the adjustment of British national defense. It is rumored that two of the five young cabinet members who supported Airdmanson's actions have written to the Prime Minister to state that the declaration they issued on this matter was not their personal opinion and solemnly declared that they did not sympathize with external criticisms. In addition, two others have personally apologized to the Prime Minister, so only the above four will continue to serve. As for Prime Minister Chamberlain himself, he is very satisfied with the situation of rearmament and expresses complete trust in Secretary of War Hore-Belisha. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that leaders of various parties who are uneasy about the diplomatic policies promoted by the Chamberlain cabinet and the inadequacy of British armaments will unite to form a new party in a short period of time. According to those in charge of this matter, "This new party will be organized by members of various parties who have independent opinions and are concerned about the state of British national defense and current diplomatic policies. Most Members of Parliament, including some members of the government faction, support this movement. A secret meeting is scheduled to be held in London on the 4th of this month to put forward a preliminary plan. This move cannot be regarded as an anti-Chamberlain movement. Its ultimate goal is to complete a greater unified situation and form a true national cabinet." It is rumored that former Foreign Secretary Eden has nothing to do with this matter. People in the government believe that the people who can be won over by this new organization will be limited to second-tier members of the Liberal and Conservative parties. The Labour Party may not participate because it is unwilling to establish a Popular Front. Randolph Churchill (name), son of Conservative extreme right-wing leader Churchill, his son-in-law Sandys, Conservative MP Macmillan, and Liberal MP and famous journalist Patrick, are all said to support this movement. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) After spending a few days with Lord Swinton, the former Secretary of Air, at Lord Swinton's villa in Ely, Prime Minister Chamberlain transferred to Elveden Hall this afternoon and was entertained by the Earl of Iveagh. He is scheduled to stay for three or four days before returning to the capital. It is rumored that the Prime Minister met with Foreign Secretary Halifax in Garopaba town and former Foreign Secretary Eden in Kulk Teller town when he was a guest in Ely. The Prime Minister denied this, saying, "I have other opportunities to discuss various issues with the Foreign Secretary, so there is no need for such detours. In short, my trip to Ely has no political function." (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<h3>US Congress Reconvenes Yesterday; Roosevelt to Submit Message; Main Goal is Expanding Military Buildup; Fascist Group's Power Extends; The United States Has Serious Concerns</h3>
<p>(Washington) The 76th US Congress convened here today and will discuss many critically important events. The President's message will be read tomorrow, which will likely emphasize that, given the deteriorating international relations, the US should urgently strengthen its preparations. It will also describe President Roosevelt's "Western Hemisphere Defense" program and expand the Monroe Doctrine, so that all countries in the New Hemisphere can jointly defend North and South America. It is expected that President Roosevelt will advocate that the US Army and Air Force should bear the responsibility for this vast program for many years to come. President Roosevelt will also advocate greatly expanding the existing military buildup program. President Roosevelt will also express his serious concerns about the increasing spread of authoritarianism. Although he will not name one or two countries that have concluded anti-communist pacts, he will likely indicate that, as Japan strives to be the "Lord of the Far East," Italy strives to expand in the Mediterranean, and Germany harbors ambitions for Eastern Europe and Ukraine, and the three powers are working together to seize markets and political convenience in South America, the United States has no choice but to strengthen its military to the best of its ability and to the extent that it does not endanger its internal economy. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The 76th US Congress, scheduled to open tomorrow, will focus on expanding military preparations and the diplomatic situation. Regarding the issue of military preparations, President Roosevelt will regularly submit messages to Congress, providing detailed explanations for the reasons for strengthening national defense, especially the plan to strengthen the air force, and advocating that the US Air Force should be on par with the strongest air force in the world, and even surpass it. Regarding the diplomatic issue, since the Munich Agreement, US public opinion had once completely leaned towards isolationism, but then advocated that a coalition of democratic countries should implement a collective security system, and expressed its support for the government's anti-authoritarian policy. This policy can be seen in the tension between the US and Germany and the US's efforts to organize a united front at the 8th Pan-American Conference. However, some members of Congress fear that President Roosevelt will use the support of public opinion to arbitrarily preside over diplomatic policy on a broader scale, resulting in a reduction of congressional power. They are bound to attack certain issues, one of which is the Neutrality Act. This law is scheduled to expire on May 1 of this year and must be amended before it expires. Most members of Congress say that this law, in its current form, is really useless, as can be seen from its application to the Spanish Civil War but not to the Sino-Japanese War in the Far East, which is enough to show its contradictions. In addition, regarding the issue of deciding on a declaration of war by referendum, the motion proposed by Indiana Democratic Congressman Ludlow in December 1937, although rejected by the last Congress, the Ludlow faction believes that at this point, the resistance from the White House and the State Department has been easier to overcome, and they will inevitably bring up the old matter again. As for domestic politics, this Congress will regularly amend certain New Deal laws, and matters related to social labor relief are the most important. Although President Roosevelt will not propose new bills, he may not abandon his original goals, which can be seen from the saying, "As long as he is in office, he will continue to promote reform policies." However, the budget deficit cannot be remedied, and relief for unemployment and expansion of military preparations require funds, so the budget cannot be balanced. It is also worrying that the number of Republican members of Congress has greatly increased, and once they combine with the New Deal opposition in the Democratic Party, they will be able to veto the bills proposed by the government. Fortunately, after a long period of cooperation between the two factions, the Democratic Party itself will be harmed in future elections. Therefore, even if that faction combines with the Republican Party, it may not last long. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Democratic Party Factionalism: Pro-New Deal Elements Still Control Congress</h3>
<p>(Washington) The 76th Congress opened this afternoon. Since 1932, this is the first time the Democratic Party has faced such a clear factional division. Pro-New Deal Democrats still control both the House and Senate, but conservative Democrats have broken with the President and no longer support his New Deal policies. Therefore, the government may encounter difficulties in passing the President's proposed agenda, which includes the largest national defense expenditure since the European War. The new Congress may oppose the President's management of federal finances and be dissatisfied with defense spending. The President's defense program includes expenditures of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, including the construction of 12,000 aircraft, two 45,000-ton battleships, and the training of air force personnel to strengthen military power. It is now known that Congress may approve the military build-up plan, but any proposal to amend the Neutrality Act will likely cause disputes. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>New York Governor Condemns Dictatorship: Emphasizes the Protection of Democracy and Preservation of Religious Freedom</h3>
<p>(Albany, New York) New York Governor Lehman (a prominent member of the Democratic Party), after being elected for another term, held an inauguration ceremony tonight and delivered a speech. He condemned all forms of dictatorship, including the dictatorships of the Communist, Fascist, and National Socialist parties. He stated that the United States should reform its social and economic problems to prevent such dictatorships from harming North America. "At this time, the original rational systems are largely replaced by systems of power. Millions of people in other countries have lost their individual freedoms and rights. In order to protect democracy, we should preserve the rights of religious freedom. The most urgent obligation we must fulfill and the responsibility we must bear is to manage public affairs to prevent such tyranny from appearing in our country. If any of the rights enjoyed by American citizens are taken away, then the dictatorship promoted in other countries will surely set foot in our country. I firmly believe that the greatest guarantee of democracy is the recognition of the truths on which religion is based. The true foundation of religion is nothing more than charity, justice, and tolerance. Anyone who attacks religion is weakening our faith, which is unacceptable," he said. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy and Air Force to Begin Large-Scale Maneuvers: Over a Hundred Warships and Six Hundred Aircraft Participate to Test the Panama Canal's Defense Capabilities</h3>
<p>(Continuation) Today, seven warships left the Brooklyn Naval Yard and headed south, marking the beginning of a large-scale U.S. naval exercise. This exercise, involving 140 warships and 600 aircraft, is intended to make Europe and South America aware of the greatness of American naval power. The "Twenty Problems," as officially called, are scheduled to begin around February 13 and will be the first exercise in the Atlantic in five years. These "problems" will involve a mock battle between attacking and defending fleets. In addition to testing the Panama Canal, some ships will travel south as far as Brazil and Colombia. According to the "New York Times," naval and radio facilities along the U.S. East Coast will be mobilized, and some merchant ships operating in the area may be asked to assist the fleet.

<h3>Britain Plans to Open a North Atlantic Air Route This Summer: Building Four Giant Aircraft That Can Safely Carry Passengers, Expansion to New York Possible if U.S. Agrees to Cooperate</h3>
<p>(London) The Royal Air Force announced today that it plans to prepare to establish a formal air route across the North Atlantic from Southampton to Montreal starting in May. Initially, this route will only transport mail, and only after obtaining appropriate safety guarantees will it be able to carry passengers. If the U.S. authorities agree, this route may be extended to New York. Furthermore, the flight from Southampton to Montreal will pass through Foynes and Botwood. According to a Royal Air Force spokesman, Pan American Airways will also establish a route from the Americas to Europe, but he has not yet been informed of this. However, the Royal Air Force has been conducting test flights for several years, and today it is preparing to fly across the Atlantic with four 45,000-pound, four-engine, twenty-four-ton aircraft. The average crossing time is expected to be sixteen hours westbound and thirteen hours returning. Of course, the time will vary depending on the wind direction. The four aircraft prepared to start flying on this new air route are the "Caribou," "Carioca," "Connemara," and "Clyde." These four aircraft were built for the purpose of transporting passengers, but the seats and decorations have not yet been fully prepared, so it is temporarily impossible to start carrying passengers.

<h3>Japanese Advance Difficult in Hunan and Jiangxi: Xue Yue Says Chinese Army Should Strive for a Large-Scale Eastern Advance</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Xue Yue, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese army in Hunan Province, expressed doubts about whether the Japanese army would launch a large-scale offensive in the Yangtze River basin at a reception for reporters in Changsha. He said that the Japanese army might concentrate its forces to attack Xi'an in the northwest and Guizhou Province in the southwest. As for the current lull in the Yangtze River front, the reasons are: (1) The Hunan-Jiangxi border has the steep Mufu Mountains as a barrier, and Poyang and Dongting Lakes are distributed in the east and west. In winter and spring, the lake water level is low, making naval operations unsuitable. (2) There is only one railway and one highway between Wuchang and Changsha, and the same is true between Jiujiang and Nanchang. The waters of the Xinqiang River and the Bulo River flow west into Dongting Lake, and the Xiu River and Gan River flow east into Poyang Lake, forming a natural defense line for Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. (3) The continuous mountains and forests of the Mufu Mountains are a strong defense line. If the Japanese army attempts to advance south from Wuchang and Jiujiang, it will be constantly harassed by the Chinese army entrenched in the Mufu Mountains. The Japanese army must transfer another four divisions to advance on Changsha and Nanchang. Therefore, in the future, China should concentrate its military, political, and economic efforts to make a large-scale eastern advance, because a westward movement is only a passive resistance, while an eastern movement can achieve creative results. Only in this way can we implement a long-term war of resistance. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Miluo: Chinese troops near Yueyang and Linxiang have recently launched surprise attacks on the Japanese army, achieving considerable gains. It is reported that more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers are moving from Yueyang and Linxiang to Macheng, Zhongxiang, Ying shan, and Guangshui. The number of Japanese troops in the area has recently increased to 7,000 or 8,000. A portion of them are moving around erratically, harassing our people. (2nd)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources received here, the Japanese 9th and 20th Divisions on the northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Hunan-Hubei Highway began to withdraw north on the 1st of this month. The reasons are unknown. Currently, only a small number of puppet troops remain in Yueyang and Tongcheng. On the 31st, a Chinese unit near Yueyang attacked the Japanese army at Dawu Fengjia, killing a Japanese company commander and over a hundred Japanese soldiers. Yesterday, the Japanese army held a memorial service in Taolin. Also, the Japanese army at Qilijinpan, southwest of Taolin, was attacked by a Chinese unit on the 2nd, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers, seizing over twenty horses, six light and heavy machine guns, and eighty-nine rifles.

<p>Chinese Army Launches Full-Scale General Assault</p>
<p>Zhanggongdu: After the Chinese army launched a full-scale general assault on New Year's Day, all routes have achieved significant gains. The Chinese army is tasked with repairing the north bank of the He River. Currently, the Chinese army still has a considerable number of troops left behind, scattered behind the Japanese lines, engaging in harassment. At the same time, some troops are stationed in the north bank of the river, guarding the pontoon bridges erected to facilitate the activities of Chinese guerrilla units on the north bank. This time, the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses due to the Chinese army's full-scale assault and is now extremely fearful of Chinese guerrillas. (3rd)</p>
<p>Japanese Army Uses Poison Gas on the North Bank of Zhanggongdu</p>
<p>Zhanggongdu: On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Japanese army, with a force of four companies, about 700 people, under the cover of intense artillery fire, once again launched an offensive against the Chinese army on the north bank of Zhanggongdu, and used gas canisters to release poison gas. More than ten of the loyal and brave Chinese defenders were poisoned, but only slightly. However, they still relied on the terrain and fortifications to firmly defend their positions and fought fiercely with the Japanese army. After a long time, they finally repelled the attacking Japanese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties in this battle, and due to the fierce fighting, the Chinese army also suffered considerable sacrifices. (3rd)</p>
<p>Zhanggongdu: On the 29th, the Japanese army at Wangjia Township in the central section of Ruiwu Road gathered more than 200 people, accompanied by 50 cavalrymen, and launched a large-scale westward attack under the cover of four Japanese aircraft, encircling and attacking the guerrilla base of a certain Chinese unit in the Yangcun Baishui area. The loyal and brave Chinese troops relied on dangerous terrain to defend firmly and fought fiercely with the Japanese army for a long time. The Japanese army was unsuccessful, so it wantonly bombed with aircraft and burned more than 300 civilian houses in nearby villages, massacring more than 200 elderly, weak, women, and children.

<h3>President of Tianjin Chamber of Commerce Assassinated</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Zulin, the president of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, who was 83 years old, has always vigorously advocated a closer economic relationship between China and Japan. He was recently assassinated in the French Concession of Tianjin. The Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin has requested the French Concession authorities to thoroughly investigate the incident and to pay closer attention to anti-Japanese elements. The atmosphere in the foreign concessions of Tianjin, which had relaxed from tension only a few days ago, has become tense again due to this incident. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Reports Victory in Huaiyang Area</h3>
<p>Luoyang: Amidst the New Year's celebrations, news of a military victory from the Huaiyang area has been received here. A large number of Japanese troops stationed at Anziling in Huaiyang, estimated to be over 2,000 combined infantry and cavalry troops, along with five tanks, were suddenly attacked by a battalion of Li's Regiment of the Chinese army. At the same time, another battalion of the Chinese army, which had been pre-positioned, quickly reinforced the Japanese army's flanks. The Japanese army, relying on its superior strength, immediately engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army, the fiercest in weeks. Under the Chinese army's flanking attacks from the front, rear, and sides, the Japanese army's momentum gradually weakened. Most of the Chinese army then rushed into Zhangdazhuang and continued to fight the Japanese army for three hours. As a result, the Japanese army was badly defeated and fled towards Huaiyang. In addition to those killed, 400 to 500 people were captured alive. Among the Japanese corpses, one company commander, Xiangyou Qing, and several platoon leaders, including Liushan Xiangzuo, were identified. Three tanks and more than ten vehicles were destroyed. Other spoils of war are still being inventoried. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Western Kang Province Government Established, President Kong's Instructions</h3>
<p>Kangding: At the inauguration of the Western Kang Province government, President Kong’s instructions were: The preparations for establishing Western Kang Province have been underway for three years. Today, the provincial government is officially established. This is the realization of a plan that the central government has been aiming at for the past several years. Chairman Liu has overseen the entire process during the preparatory period. The heads of the various departments and members have also worked together in Western Kang, and therefore, this effect has been achieved, which is very commendable. The National Government believes that the former government had short-sighted views, treating the frontier as an outcast and never finding a way to develop it. Western Kang has been part of our territory for more than 2,000 years. Since the Tang Dynasty, the relationship has become even closer, and it has long been integrated with the entire Chinese nation. The economic and cultural aspects are backward, and the resources are no less abundant than those of the inland provinces, but the population is less than one large county in the interior. The local people live in poverty. The government is concerned about our compatriots in Western Kang and deeply understands that the foundation of the war of resistance and national reconstruction must be laid in the west. Therefore, we must devote ourselves to developing the frontier’s politics and economy, and work in tandem to ensure that our frontier compatriots and those living in the interior reach the same level and enjoy the same benefits in both spirit and material. Qinghai, Ningxia, and other places have successively established provinces. After the establishment of provinces, there has been considerable progress in politics, economy, and culture, all of which have facts to prove. Although the establishment of Western Kang Province is somewhat later, the preparatory period has been long, and the central government's subsidies are even greater. When conditions are ripe, it will surely surpass others. The only thing is for the provincial government to be responsible and continue to work hard. The purpose of establishing the province has been described above. To achieve this goal, we must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions regarding material construction and psychological construction. In Western Kang Province, we must first carefully consider the right priority and catch up. We must never be high-minded and empty-headed and do one-sided work. To develop Western Kang for the purpose of building the province, to improve people's lives, and to consolidate the foundation of national defense, all construction should be aimed at the people and national defense. All those that meet the needs and contribute to national defense are urgent matters. Psychological construction, in the case of Western Kang, is cultural movement. It is undeniable that Western Kang's culture is backward. In the future, special attention should be paid to education, but the situation of education does not have to be the same as that of the interior, but the purpose of education must be the same as that of the interior. In the past, the failure of border affairs had many reasons, but cultural despotism, which did not allow people on the border to receive education, was one of the biggest reasons. There are several stories in history that reflect the misunderstanding of the frontier at that time, such as prohibiting the import of scriptures into foreign countries, and even denying the scriptures to vassal states, which was really shallow and ridiculous. In the future, the development of Western Kang's cultural undertakings can determine the government's mission, which I hope to discuss with you all. As for religious customs, they vary from place to place, and religious beliefs are clearly stated in the law. Buddhism has always been flourishing in Western Kang, so we should make use of the situation to respect the traditional customs so that they do not harm the unity of the country. We must never impose on others what we do not want, and cause misunderstandings due to disagreements. In short, at the beginning of Western Kang's establishment as a province, the social atmosphere and folk customs are simple and unadorned, just like a blank sheet of paper. Whatever is written is appropriate, and it only depends on whether the writer is good at writing or not. All of you have profound knowledge and experience, and I firmly believe that you will be able to follow the central government's intentions, develop from the bottom up, and benefit the country. The brand new situation has just begun to be promoted today. There are high expectations. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Border Defense Line Solidly Deployed</h3>
<p>Xingji: It is reported that the Japanese army, a regiment that invaded Niangniang Temple to the north, after capturing Xiangning, invaded Jixian City at 7:00 a.m. on the 31st. By the afternoon, the Japanese army advanced west in three routes. One route, with more than 400 people, passed through Lancun, seemingly heading towards Longwang Temple. Another route advanced through Gaolou Village towards Xiaochuanwo. The third route took the road through Guantoushan towards Guxian Village. They have already made contact with a certain Chinese division. The Hexi defense line is now firmly deployed. If the Japanese army crosses the river to harass Shaanxi, it will suffer a major blow. (2nd)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Military news: The Japanese army, about a regiment, invading north of Xiangning, captured Jixian on the 31st. In the afternoon, part of the Japanese army advanced west, appearing to be attacking the Yellow River. On the morning of the 1st, there was fierce fighting in the Guantoushan area (20 miles northwest of Jixian). According to reports, this route of the Japanese army was intercepted by a certain Chinese unit, killing and wounding dozens of people. In the afternoon of the 1st, they fled back to Jixian. So far, the Japanese army in Guxian has only occupied various hilltops near the county seat. There is no trace of the Japanese army more than ten miles away. Chinese units have been divided into two groups, one on the north mountain and one on the south mountain, to encircle the Japanese army. The river defense units are also fully equipped. (3rd)</p>

<h3>The Process of the Red Army Led by Xiang Ying Participating in the War of Resistance Against Japan: Warriors from Eight Provinces Responded from Afar, Concentrated, and Engaged in Battle for Six Months, Japanese Army Suffered Over 2,000 Casualties</h3>
<p>Belden, special correspondent of the English-language Da Mei Evening News, correspondence from the headquarters of the New Fourth Route Army south of Wuhu: Along the Yangtze River, from Nanjing in the east to Anqing in the west, and reaching the mountains, lakes, and rivers in the north and south, the New Fourth Route Army operates within it. At dusk and dawn, they raid Japanese garrisons, snipe transport ships, overturn trucks, capture Japanese prisoners and return to headquarters, and explode Japanese storage areas, demolish bridges, and destroy highways. Day after day, they harass Japanese sentries, and occasionally attack assembled regular Japanese troops. The New Fourth Route Army has 20,000 people, divided into four detachments, two-thirds of whom are former Red Army soldiers. However, they did not participate in the "Long March," because they were left behind to continue fighting the Central Army. In 1934, when Zhu De and Mao Zedong led the main force of the Red Army on the Long March, they left behind a considerable number of Red Army troops led by Xiang Ying to contain the attacks of the Central Army. They then dispersed to various places. Xiang Ying is now the deputy commander of the New Fourth Route Army. According to him, for the past three years, most of the Red Army troops have been sleeping on the mountains, sleeping on the ground, often traveling more than a hundred miles every night, carrying three days' worth of food. Without the people, the Red Army would never be able to exist. When in trouble, they rely on the farmers and villagers for food and leadership to break through the encirclement. After the Lugou Bridge Incident, the remnants of the Red Army in South China appealed to the government to be transferred to the front lines to resist Japan, and the government agreed. In September, Xiang Ying went to Nanchang to meet with He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs, on behalf of the government. In October, the Military Commission agreed to incorporate the former Red Army into the National Army. Ye Ting, who had retired to Hong Kong for many years due to his active military life, was appointed as commander and named the New Fourth Route Army. It was not until December that they received orders to go to the front lines and gather the former Red Army troops scattered in various places. In the towns and villages, messengers spread the word that the central government and the Red Army would no longer fight each other, and that they would only fight Japan from now on. The Red Army's radio station also used this news to inform middle-ranking commanding officers without radio stations, and used government trucks to go to the provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Hunan to spread Xiang Ying's summons. They then traveled from these eight provinces to the front lines to fight the Japanese army. They walked at least eight hundred miles to the meeting place, and some walked more than two thousand miles. By April, most of the army had assembled, with 40% occupying the north bank of the Yangtze River and 60% occupying the south bank. Government personnel came to register the number of people and issue weapons. Since the New Fourth Route Army first fought the Japanese army in Shucheng in early May, they have been fighting every day without interruption. According to their own records, the New Fourth Route Army fought for six months, and the Japanese army suffered more than 2,500 casualties, and 500 rifles were seized. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Activities Increasingly Active in Suzhou and Jiaxing: Japanese Army Often Harassed by Guerrillas, Chinese Do Not Trust Japanese Military Scrip</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that a certain merchant who recently traveled to the guerrilla areas of Jiaxing and Suzhou for business has returned to Shanghai. Yesterday (2nd), he told reporters that guerrilla activities have recently become increasingly active. The Japanese army claims to have obtained the peace and order it sought, but it has not achieved it. In the small villages within 50 miles of Jiaxing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, there are active guerrilla forces. Anyone entering and leaving Jiaxing City who does not wear a "good citizen badge" is suspected of being a guerrilla. Anyone who angers the Japanese guards will be abused by them. The Japanese army explains its abuse of the people by pointing out that the person "is a Communist." Since the fall of Suzhou, only a small number of Japanese troops have been stationed there, and they have recently been harassed by guerrillas. The Japanese army has no peace, so it has tightened its defenses and increased its troops. In the past, there were no military defenses in and around Suzhou City, but in the past few weeks, pillboxes and machine-gun nests have been built at the city gates. Every morning, the sound of Japanese gunfire can be heard outside the city. The Japanese army says it is practicing, but we know it is fighting with the Chinese. The trains to Suzhou and Jiaxing run fairly on time. It is impossible to reserve or pre-purchase train tickets, so the stations are often crowded with people waiting for the ticket windows to open. When the Japanese check the passengers' passes on the train, they charge a "small fee" for each item carried: one dime for a basket of fruit, and two dimes for a bundle of clothes. Although there are no large-scale rapes or robberies now, at night, Japanese soldiers still go to people's homes to rob valuables and harass women. Most of the food needed by the Japanese army is supplied by the Chinese. The Japanese army appoints a Chinese person as an intermediary to buy food from farmers. Therefore, farmers and merchants can still buy and sell, but what they receive is Japanese military scrip. At the current exchange rate, farmers receive one yuan of Japanese military scrip for one yuan of legal tender, but in the past, military scrip was worth more, with one yuan of Japanese currency worth one yuan and two dimes of legal tender. The Chinese have no trust in Japanese military scrip because the Japanese army is issuing it indiscriminately. They are also unwilling to accept Japanese banknotes. Farmers often survive by making goods at home. They can still do this now, so trade with Japanese merchants in the countryside has failed. Farmers try to exchange their Japanese currency for legal tender, while merchants need Japanese currency because they can only use Japanese currency. Once the farmers get legal tender, they save it. The Japanese army's efforts to prevent guerrillas from entering towns and villages have also failed. A few days ago, a certain well-dressed Chinese man arrived at the Jiaxing military headquarters in a rickshaw. The servant went out to greet him. This man presented two cartons of Pai Men cigarettes, a very popular brand in Jiaxing, and a note stating that they were for the commanding officer of the headquarters. The Japanese commanding officer was delighted to see them. He opened the first carton and found the cigarettes to be very good. However, when he opened the second carton, a bomb exploded inside, injuring the officer and many others. By the time the Japanese army went out to capture the cigarette deliverer, he had already fled far away. Although this person escaped, other Chinese were badly treated by the Japanese that night, who searched people's homes and arrested and punished men. The guerrillas behind the Japanese lines are obviously very well organized. In addition to sniping at the Japanese army, they also have spies operating in the towns and villages.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Puppet Organization's Decline in Tax Collection; Many Property Owners Disobey</h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: The puppet county government established a puppet tax collection committee in mid-November of last year. In addition to the directors of urban and rural areas serving as de facto puppet committee members, several landlords from each township were also included. The puppet tax offices in urban and rural areas were also established one after another, each with one puppet director, two deputy directors, three accountants, six collectors, and three clerks. With so many redundant personnel, the expenses were enormous, requiring 502 yuan per office per month. Most of these tax collectors were former yamen runners, excelling at exploiting the villagers, which caused immense suffering among the farmers. Fifty percent of the collected taxes were allocated to the accountants of the property owners, who would issue receipts and keep them in custody. Sixteen percent was designated as "rural relief funds," allocated to the township management committees or township directors for safekeeping and management. The remaining thirty-four percent was handed over to the puppet county government in full. In late December, the puppet county government also</p>
<p>issued fourteen strict articles outlining the procedures for tax collection, reflecting a clear lack of trust in the personnel responsible for the collection. Although these regulations were in place, they failed to gain the trust of most property owners. Initially, the deadline for property owners to submit registers of tenant names to the county was November 15th, but few complied. The deadline was extended to the end of December, but in reality, only over 60,000 households submitted registers, less than a quarter of the total number of property owners in the county. Recently, the puppet county government sent letters to the neighboring puppet county governments of Jiading, Taicang, Qingpu, Wuxian, and Changshu, requesting them to notify all property owners under their jurisdiction with farmland in Kunshan to promptly submit registers of their managed land and taxes. Simultaneously, notices were posted in urban and rural areas, informing property owners to submit tax registers to the county and not to collect rent privately, but these efforts yielded no results.</p>
<p>The decline in tax collection by the puppet organization in Kunshan can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, large parts of the countryside are under the control of guerrilla forces, making it impossible for puppet tax collectors to penetrate. Secondly, most of the tax collectors are idle elements from urban and rural areas with addictions, and property owners are unwilling to entrust them with the hard-earned rent. Thirdly, most property owners in the countryside are well aware of the nature of the tenants and often collect rent themselves, without the need for such cumbersome procedures. Due to these factors, the puppet organization faces numerous difficulties in collecting taxes, and even with all-out efforts, it is difficult to achieve results.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing, Haiyan, and Chinese Army Eliminate Puppet Guerrillas; Ten Bandits Use False Pretexts, Committing All Kinds of Evil Everywhere</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: After the ×× Division of the Chinese Army crossed the river to Haiyan, they advanced towards the towns of Shendang, Yucheng in Haiyan, and Xinhuang, Fengjie Bridge, and Shifosi in Jiaxing. The Japanese troops entrenched in Xinfeng were completely eliminated. As a result, the Pingjia Highway in Pinghu was completely demolished and leveled, and all ports, large and small, were sealed off with wooden fences, cutting off all transportation. However, in the surrounding countryside, bandit-style guerrillas, falsely claiming to be fighting the enemy, were rampant, extorting money from villages, carrying firearms, and robbing and torturing people in gangs, causing unbearable suffering. They openly kidnapped people, and the public, fearing their retaliation, endured the violence in silence. A widow in her thirties, who once ran the Lu Songsheng South Goods Store in Fengjie Bridge, was living with the owner of the Jinglun Silk and Cloth Store in a certain village near Fengjie Bridge. A Shaoxing guerrilla leader led his team and broke into the house, mistakenly believing her to be the Jinglun owner's primary wife. They brutally interrogated her, stripped her naked, and burned her lower body with fire, then extinguished it with water, repeating the process until the widow died a tragic death. After the widow's death, her three children were displaced. Similar cases are numerous. After learning of this situation, the cadres of the ×× Division held a joint military-civilian celebration in Fengjie Bridge. The director of the Political Training Department, Kuang, announced the decision to eliminate the bandits falsely claiming to be guerrillas to alleviate the suffering of the people. After the meeting, the guerrilla leader who tortured the Lu Songsheng widow was arrested in a certain village, and five rifles and two short guns were confiscated from his home, along with countless stolen goods. He was paraded through the streets and then executed by shooting in Qingshui Bay, and his heart was dug out as an offering to the deceased widow, greatly pleasing the people. At the same time, two thieves (actually bandit-style guerrillas) were arrested and executed by shooting in Shifosi and Yuxian Dai respectively. Since then, the bandit atmosphere in the surrounding areas has gradually subsided, and land and water transportation has returned to normal. The division also jointly requested the Provincial Government Action Committee with the People's National Salvation Army led by Jiang Shuwei to appoint captains of the major brigades, assign their stationed areas, organize anti-traitor groups to eliminate traitors, and expand the intelligence network to facilitate the recovery of lost territories.</p>

<h3>Electric Accounting Method and Electric Computers</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The ancient method of calculation was knot-tying for record-keeping. Later, Rome invented the abacus, thus having a tangible method of calculation. This was the first step in the success of the calculation world. Most Eastern countries still use it today. By the end of the seventeenth century, Pascal's calculator was produced, using mechanical force for numerical calculation and organization, with efficiency more agile than the abacus, and could avoid errors and save brainpower. This was the second step in the success of the calculation world. The application of this type of computer is very useful for small-scale surveys and statistics. Even today, banks, businesses, and department stores in our country still commonly use it. However, for larger-scale surveys and statistics, the time constraints and heavy workload are still insufficient. The beginning of the nineteenth century was also the beginning of the third successful step in the calculation world. The success of this step has brought about unprecedented development in the entire calculation problem, which is worthy of praise. Tangible methods of calculation still require the use of quick wit to be successful. This reform does not focus on the tangible, but automates the entire procedure through machine calculation. This is the basis of the electric accounting method invented by statistical expert Dr. Harold Hollerith. This principle has been repeatedly reformed. Among the best are Mr. White and Mr. Hollerith. After decades of improvement, its effectiveness and scope of application have increased day by day. A large amount of data can be obtained with the most accurate results in a very short time. Therefore, this machine, which was once regarded as a rare treasure by a few statisticians, has now become a powerful tool for various industrial, commercial, administrative, and educational institutions to develop their business and strictly manage and prepare various detailed reports.</p>
<p>1.  Principles and Application of Electric Accounting Methods</p>
<p>The principle of the electric accounting method is to use various data and punch holes in specially made cards using the punching method. The machine then works by contacting the holes punched on the cards, causing the current to be interrupted. It is like a blind person reading a book, using raised letters to distinguish. However, when you see the electric motor working, the motor is turned on, and each machine automatically starts working. Various data items in the card box, like snowflakes flying, are calculated and organized in an instant. The speed and accuracy of its work are amazing, and it is believed that this complex machine is based on the above simple principles.</p>
<p>The application of electric accounting methods usually goes through the following steps:</p>
<p>A. Numbering: Classify various data and compile numbers. Even words such as people's names and place names are represented by numbers. For example, in customs import and export trade statistics, the names of various goods and place names are printed in special books, all for the purpose of organizing this survey and statistics. The job of numbering is to compile each data item into a special number to represent it. After the numbers are compiled, punch holes on the cards according to the numbers. These cards are specially and precisely made. Their thickness and weight must be uniform in order to be compatible with the internal structure of the machine.</p>
<p>B. Registration: After compiling all the data into numbers, punch the numbers onto the cards. The placement of these numbers has a certain arrangement. Each row represents an item. The electric computer uses up to eighty horizontal rows on the card, and each row has twelve punching positions, counted from 0 to 12. When completely filled, 960 holes can be punched. Therefore, this card is sufficient to represent any complex material. The latest method is that those who are not suitable for representation by numbers can also use English multi-purpose punching machines to punch the data into English letters and numbers. Whether the numbers are compiled or not, the generated report can be printed out in both text and numbers.</p>
<p>C. Proofreading: After punching, it is necessary to proofread whether the cards are accurate. The punch operator puts the cards into the proofreading machine and punches the original data again. Every time a key is pressed, if it matches the previously punched hole, the machine will push the card forward one row. If the card does not move forward, it indicates that there is an error in the original card, and it must be re-punched.</p>
<p>D. Classification: After the punching is completed, the order of the cards is usually extremely chaotic. Therefore, a counting and sorting machine must be used to arrange them in the order of a certain piece of data to be based on. Its rate is to sort 400 cards per minute.</p>
<p>E. Tabulation: The ultimate goal of the electric accounting method is to automatically compile and print the data into a report. This step must use a calculating and printing machine, because this machine is a complex addition and subtraction classification and printing machine. Place the punched cards into the machine, which can make the adder and printer work one after another. This machine can also adapt to any changes in the report format. The machine is fully automatic, printing the report while automatically punching the total number onto another card. Its functions are unparalleled.</p>
<p>2.  Benefits of Electric Accounting Methods</p>
<p>There are many benefits of electric accounting methods. They can be roughly summarized into four points: speed, accuracy, adaptability, and simplicity.</p>
<p>Speed: The ordinary registration methods are nothing more than hand registration and typing. Hand registration methods have been abolished for various modern registration items. As for the most agile typist, they can only type 240 letters per minute. If electric accounting method punching registration is applied, roughly 500 holes can be punched per minute. From this perspective, registering with an electric computer is 50% faster than a typewriter. Moreover, the machine can automatically copy cards, and the more copies, the greater this percentage. The amazing speed of electric accounting method classification work is unmatched in the world. This has been recognized as a fact by mankind. According to the results of actual verification, the efficiency of electric computers in addition is about 1 to 72 compared with adding machines. As for the product, electric motors are more than twice as fast as multiple machines. The most moving aspect of electric accounting methods is that most of the work is automated. Therefore, after punching the cards, employees can make the translator, sorter, and computer work one by one. When the machine is working automatically, employees can take on other jobs.</p>
<p>Accuracy: The second benefit of electric accounting methods is accuracy, and 100% accuracy. After punching the cards, they are checked and proven to be error-free. Then the calculations and reports made based on the cards will also be error-free. Using this constant card as a medium for registration, selection, classification, calculation, etc., its accuracy is self-evident. The common weakness of other calculation methods is that it takes a lot of money and time to balance the debit and credit sides. To avoid this common error of artificial methods, one must rely on electric accounting methods.</p>
<p>Adaptability: The electric accounting method is very adaptable. If the punched card is not full and you want to add data, it only takes very little time and the cheapest price to add several more groups on the card. The area of the card is very small and it is very easy to store, and it may become very valuable data in the future. Special analysis comparison reports and various government-requested information can be found on the punched cards. A set of machines can handle multiple tasks, so the punching registration method can concentrate all work in one place, and if the using organization wants to modify the system or change the method, it only needs to modify the form of the card, or re-insert the electrical plug board on the tabulation machine, and it will be done. The supervisors of various businesses often like to get the grand total first due to special needs, and then close it once so that the management office can use this to create a financial report. Accounting and statistical personnel often feel that this procedure is repetitive. If electric accounting methods are used, it is not limited by the order, and can provide reports in any order.</p>
<p>Simplicity: The manpower used in electric accounting methods is only in punching and proofreading punching. The simplicity of the punching procedure can be learned by anyone. These punch operators do not necessarily need to have any experience in business to learn how to punch any type of card. Because this type of card has been recognized as the medium for using automatic machines. In addition to the punching work, the subsequent tabulation procedures are all automatic by the machine.</p>
<p>3.  Introduction to Electric Computers</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the entire equipment of electric computers only included three machines: a punch machine, a sorter, and a computer. The work that these three basic machines could handle was not complete. The various tasks before and after the calculation work often had to be done manually. Now, the most complete and efficient electric motors are produced by International Machines Corporation. Here are some of the most important ones:</p>
<p>(1) Punch Machine and Electric Punch Machine</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this machine is dedicated to punching holes. The latter has better functions. The average rate is five holes per second.</p>
<p>(2) Proofreading Machine: Dedicated to proofreading. Place the punched card on this machine and punch it again. If there is an error in the original punched card, the machine will not move forward when the button is pressed. Proofreading is simple and agile. There is also a mechanical proofreading machine and an electric proofreading machine.</p>
<p>(3) Automatic Translator: Translates each of the 45 lines or a part of the data that has been punched on the card and prints it on the card, making verification, filing, selection, and reference easier and faster.</p>
<p>(4) Automatic Group Punch Machine: Sometimes, many cards must be punched with the same holes, either all or partially. The function of the group punch machine is to rush to complete this type of work.</p>
<p>(5) English Punch Machine: This machine can punch English letters and numbers on the card, and then the English calculating and printing machine can print them into English names, words, and numbers.</p>
<p>(6) Electric Sorter: This machine can automatically divide all cards into categories, and at the same time arrange each category of cards in any order, and can select all cards of a certain category without disturbing the original order of other categories of cards. After this machine is equipped with a card selector, it can select a certain special number from a stack of cards without disturbing the original order of the cards.</p>
<p>(7) Automatic Counting Machine: This machine can automatically multiply the number groups punched on the table example card, and at the same time subtract when multiplying, and automatically punch the product, sum, and difference in the designated place on this card.</p>
<p>(8) Calculating Printing Machine and Automatic Summarizing Machine: The calculating printing machine is a complex adding and subtracting sorting and printing machine, which can automatically print a complete report according to the table example card. Its rate is 150 cards per minute, and it can print out the number of items, sub-items, totals, and differences. If this machine is equipped with an automatic summarizing machine, it will punch another card with the summary number or difference at the same time when calculating and printing, increasing the printing efficiency and saving punching time.</p>
<p>English Calculating Printing Machine: This machine can use completed punched cards to print English letters on the report. In addition to the working efficiency of the calculating printing machine, it also gets the assistance of English letters.</p>
<p>(9) Card Position Selector: Position selection occupies an important position in all printing machines. Therefore, this device can increase the adaptability of the electric computer. When printing the holes punched on the table example card into a report, this device can automatically classify different data in a group and print them separately on the report. Conversely, this device can also select the same data punched in each group on the card from each group and print it into a total number on the report. Therefore, this device can freely add certain data in the same group to the report, and can also freely delete certain data in the same group from the report.</p>
<p>(10) Calculating Sorter: Sometimes work is urgent, and it is necessary to find a way to perform the two tasks of calculation and sorting at the same time. This machine is sufficient to complete this purpose. If only one task is done, it is also possible.</p>
<p>(11) Automatic Re-Punch Machine: This machine can re-punch all or partial numbers or English letter data on cards with the same re-punched or group-punched data. It can be re-punched or group-punched in any order or at the same time.</p>
<p>(12) Electric Copying Punch Machine: In addition to the function of the electric punch machine, this machine can also be used to re-punch the entire card or a certain group of records that are the same on several cards. The fingers still need to move when punching the original card, but the subsequent action of copying the second card is completely automatic by the machine.</p>
<p>(13) Automatic Check Translator: This machine has three functions: A. Check filling machine B. Check protector C. Table example card translator These three functions can be used interchangeably at any time.</p>
<p>(14) International Re-Punch Machine: This machine has a dual function, which can be used to re-punch or group-punch cards. If you want to copy part or all of any group of cards, you can use this machine. The data of each card can be changed to another position and group-punched on the detailed number card, and re-punching and group-punching can work at the same time. When re-punching a group of cards according to the original card, the groups that should be punched can be group-punched immediately.</p>
<p>Looking at the above machines, we can see the hard work of European and American countries in the research of electric accounting methods. The degree of precision and prudence is truly admirable. In addition to applying it, should we not feel ashamed, eliminate the dross and preserve the essence, and promote and expand it? Is this not the responsibility of the citizens of the new China?</p>

<h3>Municipal Organization of the French Concession</h3>
<p>— Shugan</p>
<p>After the French Concession was established on March 14th of the Daoguang 29th year of the Qing Dynasty (April 6, 1849), it took eight years, and the police station was officially established on February 7th of the Xianfeng 7th year of the Qing Dynasty (December 22, 1857). As for the municipal agency, the Board of Directors, it was not established until April 3rd of the Tongzhi 1st year of the Qing Dynasty (May 1, 1863).</p>
<p>The board of directors of the Board of Directors was initially appointed by the French Consul-General in Shanghai, but later changed to an election system. After the 16th year of the Republic of China, it was changed to an appointment system again. From then on, the elected board of directors of the French Concession was interrupted and replaced by appointments, which changed annually.</p>
<p>The board of directors of the Board of Directors is divided into nine committees: Engineering, Finance, Education, Doctor Relief, Transportation Horticulture, Real Estate, Rectification Room Donation, and Hospital Management. Although the organization is numerous, it is only an agency representing public opinion, and more realistically speaking, it is only an advisory agency to the French Consul-General. All administrative and police powers within the concession, as well as the appointment and removal of public officials, belong to the French Consul-General.</p>
<p>As for the internal organization of the Board of Directors, it was initially divided into: Municipal General Affairs Office, Public Works Office, Police Office, and Medical Office. On December 21st of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the board of directors of the French Board of Directors believed that the municipal affairs within the concession were becoming increasingly complex. In order to make the sequence of each agency and the work of each level have excellent efficiency, it was decided to reorganize the agencies within the Bureau, and the organization was more secretive and complex than before; later, there were considerable reforms. The organization of this year is listed below:</p>

<h3>Still Lingering in Hong Kong Yesterday - Wang Jingwei Did Not Come to Shanghai - Various Rumors Arriving in Shanghai Found to be Untrue - Chu Minyi Left His Residence, His Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>Since Wang Jingwei violated party and national discipline and was expelled from the party and removed from his post by the Central Committee, there have been many rumors about his whereabouts in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places in recent days. The night before last and yesterday, there were rumors in this city that he had already arrived in Shanghai, and some said that he had gone to Hongkou. After inquiries by our reporters, it was found that the rumors of Wang's arrival in Shanghai were mostly unreliable. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>No Trace of Wang on the Italian Ship</p>
<p>Rumors of his arrival in Shanghai began circulating in this city the night before last, claiming that he had taken the Italian ship "Conte Rosso" from Hong Kong to Shanghai and disembarked at the Osaka Wharf in Hongkou the day before yesterday. However, after investigation by reporters, it was found that the "Conte Rosso" arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM on the 31st of last month. The claim that the ship arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd is likely a mistake. The ship is currently scheduled to set sail from Shanghai at 6:00 AM today to return to Europe. The shipping company also denied that Wang took the ship to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi Out Yesterday, Not Returned</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was suddenly rumored in this city that Wang had already arrived in Shanghai, because Hongkou had announced a special curfew on the evening of the 2nd, with Japanese marines densely stationed and traffic cut off. The rumor-mongers believed that the curfew was different from usual and therefore believed it was evidence of Wang's arrival in Shanghai. There were also rumors that Wang was staying in the Broadway Mansions. However, after investigation, these rumors were also found to be untrue. Last night, reporters also visited Chu Minyi, who has been staying in Shanghai for a long time, but were unable to meet him. According to sources, Chu was still in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, his gatekeeper told reporters that Chu had gone out yesterday morning and had not returned to his residence when the reporter visited. The claim that Chu has gone elsewhere is still difficult to verify.</p>
<p>Wang's Arrival in Shanghai is Absolutely Not True</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to reliable sources, after various evening newspapers in this city published confusing news about Wang Jingwei secretly arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, it aroused deep attention from all circles in this city. In order to verify the truth, our reporters traveled around to inquire from various sources. Until late at night, it was confirmed by reliable sources that Wang is still staying in Hong Kong as of yesterday. The claim that he had taken the Italian ship and arrived in Shanghai is absolutely not true.</p>
<p>Fast News Agency Reports Wang's Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai dispatch of the Fast News Agency, it is widely rumored among well-informed sources here that Wang Jingwei, who recently betrayed the country by surrendering to Japan, arrived in Shanghai late last night and disembarked at the Hongkou Wharf. After various inquiries by reporters from the Fast News Agency, it is learned that Chu Minyi, who has close relations with Wang and has been staying in Shanghai for a long time, suddenly left his residence at 408 Avenue Albert late yesterday. It is certain that Chu was still at his residence at 408 Avenue Albert the night before last (the 2nd). He did not spend the night there that night, and he was not seen returning to his residence yesterday. His family members said that they did not know where he had gone. Many believe that Chu may not have left Shanghai to go to Hong Kong, but is likely related to going to Hongkou to meet Wang. Therefore, the claim that Wang has secretly arrived in Shanghai and has arrived in Hongkou is very possible. In addition, Hongkou implemented a special curfew from 11:00 PM the night before last, which is why there are rumors of Wang's arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Although Customs Revenue is Temporarily Stopped from Being Transferred, Finances Are Not Affected - The Ministry of Finance Has Already Taken Remedial Measures - The Japanese Side is Not Allowed to Withdraw or Transfer the Stored Tax Funds</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Chinese financial community, although Shanghai Jianghai Customs revenue has been forced to deposit in the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank since July last year and stopped from being transferred to the National Government, resulting in a decrease in government tax revenue, this has not affected China's finances. For example, foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties are still being repaid as before. This is because the authorities of the Ministry of Finance have already taken countermeasures, establishing new tax collection offices in the inland and coastal areas. All goods transported from areas occupied by the Japanese army must pay national taxes again in order to make up for this loss. According to news released by the Jianghai Customs authorities, the depositing of these tax funds in the Yokohama Specie Bank cannot be regarded as having been seized, because the tax funds deposited in the Japanese bank are all in the name of Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, and cannot be used without Sir Maze's consent. Maze is under the command of the Ministry of Finance, and this measure also has international implications. The Anglo-Japanese Customs Temporary Agreement also stipulates that the funds cannot be withdrawn or transferred.</p>
<h3>American Flour Shipped to Shanghai - Totaling 24,000 Bags - Result of the American "One Bowl of Rice" Movement</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai dispatch of the Fast News Agency, the American people, in sympathy with China's resistance against Japan and in view of the prolonged war, the expansion of the war zone, and the increase in innocent disaster victims, launched a "One Bowl of Rice" movement to raise funds to purchase American wheat to ship to China for relief. Now, another 24,000 bags of American wheat for refugee relief have been entrusted to the American Red Cross to be shipped to China on the "Saukra" ship. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai the day after tomorrow. Of the 24,000 bags of American wheat, 8,000 bags will be distributed to South China and will be unloaded en route via Hong Kong. The remaining 16,000 bags will be distributed by the International Relief Committee in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>After the Ministry of Finance Reorganized Transit Tax, Last Year's Increase Exceeded 50 Million - Although in the Midst of Fierce Sino-Japanese War, Still More Than Doubled Compared to the Previous Year</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance reorganized transit tax, tax revenue increased significantly. Although the 27th year was in the midst of a fierce Sino-Japanese war and trade between China and foreign countries declined, transit tax was still better than the previous year. According to statistics from the Directorate General of Customs, the total transit tax of all ports nationwide in the whole year was 55,400,000 yuan, exceeding the 20,150,000 yuan of the previous year by 35,690,000 yuan, a sharp increase of more than double.</p>
<h3>All Government Agencies and Organizations Will Resume Work as Usual Starting Today - Silver Shops Will Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>All government agencies and organizations in this city, such as the Jianghai Customs and the Post Office, have followed the usual practice of taking a three-day holiday to celebrate New Year's Day. Now that the holiday is over, it has been decided to resume work as usual starting today. All members of the Shanghai Silver and Money Trades Association, including banks and money shops, were able to obtain a surplus in the final accounts of this session. After the final settlement for the 27th year, they all took a four-day holiday starting on the 1st. However, in order to sort out various businesses over the past year and handle the final accounts, internal office work is still as usual. Therefore, internal settlements in various banks have still been busy in recent days. All are allowed to open for business on the 5th. Most banks were able to obtain a surplus in the final accounts.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at the Hong Kong Chung Hwa Book Company Resolved - Shanghai Colleagues Received Telegram Reporting</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong headquarters of the Chung Hwa Book Company previously dismissed employees, which led to a labor dispute and a strike. All employees telegraphed the Central Government, requesting assistance, and telegraphed the Shanghai Chung Hwa Book Company Employees' Association, reporting the progress of the dispute and requesting a telegram to the Hong Kong headquarters requesting that work be resumed immediately. It is learned that the Shanghai Association received a report yesterday stating that the labor dispute in Hong Kong had been resolved and the factory had announced the resumption of work. The wages during the strike period will still be paid as usual. It is said that the Shanghai Association intends to make a detailed report on the resolution of the labor dispute and distribute it to colleagues in Haiphong, Kunming, and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Loan Syndicates Press for Repayment from Fishermen Who Joined the Puppet Fishing Market - This Kind of Action is Despicable - The Loan Syndicate Will Not Grant Leniency</h3>
<p>According to a special dispatch from Hong Kong, banking circles revealed that in order to develop the coastal fishing industry, the Ministry of Industry previously established a loan syndicate with banking circles in Shanghai and lent out huge amounts of loans, stipulating repayment on schedule. Subsequently, due to the outbreak of the war, the loans could not be repaid on schedule. The syndicate, understanding the difficulties of the merchants, granted leniency. It is now learned that a small number of fishing merchants have actually raised funds to join the puppet "Fishing Market" and purchase shares in the so-called "Central China Fisheries Company." This kind of action is despicable. The syndicate will not grant them leniency, and legitimate fishermen will also ask the government to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Hata Shunroku Returned to Japan to Relinquish His Position - Successor Not Yet Announced - Rumored to be Selected from Young Military Officers</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland News, it was learned last night (the 2nd) that Hata Shunroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in Central China, has recently returned to Japan and will soon meet with the Japanese Emperor to relinquish his position as Commander-in-Chief. Hata's successor has not yet been announced, but according to Japanese sources, the new Commander-in-Chief will be selected from young generals who are not well known to outsiders. Hata has meritorious service in the Japanese Army. In 1901, he first served as an artillery officer. In 1931, he was promoted to Lieutenant General. In November 1937, he was promoted to General and commanded the Japanese army in the Shanghai area.</p>
<h3>Curfew Suddenly Imposed on Waibaidu Bridge Last Night</h3>
<p>From 11:00 PM last night, the Japanese side suddenly imposed a curfew at the Waibaidu Bridge, prohibiting all vehicles from passing through and only allowing pedestrians to pass. It will be open until 5:00 AM at dawn. The reason for this will be investigated and reported later.</p>
<h3>Alumni of Zhejiang Advanced School Held New Year's Dinner - Recalling Old Stories from 30 Years Ago - The Situation at the Time of Establishing the School</h3>
<p>Alumni of the Zhejiang Advanced School in Shanghai held a dinner yesterday. Old teachers and students who attended included Chen Shenshu, Sun Qincai, Xiang Lansun, Qian Jiaqia, Shou Baigeng, Jun Peizi, Tu Kaitai, Xu Jiyin, Tang Shunian, Xiong Lingxiao, Xu Xingbin, Zhou Chichen, Liu Fuzhong, He Baixiang, Pan Gengsheng, Chuan Zhuangmin, Xu Yongzuo, Feng Liutang, Meng Wangqu, Zhu Hongru, Lu Zongfu, Yin Heng, Sheng Shuhang, Ruan Kai, Ma Gongping, and more than thirty other people. During the dinner, everyone talked about the school life of 30 years ago. Mr. Chen Zhongshu was a pioneer in Zhejiang's education. His description of the education establishment during the late Qing Dynasty was not as detailed in official documents. At that time, they didn't know how to run the school, so they visited the Shanghai St. John's University and the Hangzhou Yu Ying College to learn. However, even a small blackboard could not be used with chalk because the black paint was faded. He also wrote a "Criminal Braid Essay" for students, which was denounced by Manchu and Mongolian students, almost causing a literary inquisition. Fortunately, Ren Daorong, the Zhejiang Governor at the time, understood the big picture and nothing happened. And above the school supervisors was the Director-General, and the supervisors also had one official and one gentry member. All of these showed the poor state of education when China first established schools. The listeners sometimes laughed and sometimes sighed, but they never tired of listening. It is said that the teachers and students of the school are still writing memoirs to show a glimpse of the school at that time. The so-called Zhejiang University, Zhejiang Advanced School, and Zhejiang Higher School after the Republic of China are all purely recreational in nature. During the dinner, they only talked about old stories and reminisced about the past, so they felt even closer.</p>
<h3>30,000 White Russians Will Celebrate the New Year - Lunar New Year's Eve is on the 13th - White Russians Will Celebrate</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland News, Shanghai has mostly passed the New Year, but the 30,000 White Russian immigrants in this city are only about to complete their preparations for celebrating Christmas and the New Year. Although White Russians who have wandered abroad have officially adopted the Gregorian calendar, they have not abandoned their old lunar calendar in terms of holidays. According to this calendar, Friday evening is Christmas Eve, and Friday evening, January 13th, is Lunar New Year's Eve. After the Soviet government came to power in Russia, it abolished the old calendar and adopted the Gregorian calendar, so the people of the Soviet Union also celebrate New Year's Day on the same day as other European countries. However, White Russian immigrants still follow the old calendar. At that time, White Russians in this city will celebrate, and White Russian churches will also light traditional candles and hold special religious ceremonies.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on the Import of Foreign Goods Have Been Effective - Imports of Luxury Goods Have Been Sharply Reduced - The Overall Import Surplus Has Been Reduced as a Result - Foreign Exchange is Still Supplied for the Import of Necessities</h3>
<p>The Chinese government, in view of the fact that since the Anti-Japanese War, the number of imports of luxury goods and non-essential goods has still been huge, which has greatly affected foreign exchange reserves, had to impose restrictions. Therefore, the measures for restricting the import of non-essential goods were announced, and the Central Bank was responsible for implementation. The measures classify imported goods into two categories: necessities and non-necessities. There are 65 categories of necessities, and non-necessities are luxury goods, consumables, and goods that are already produced domestically. All import firms must fill out an import exchange certificate when applying for foreign exchange from the Central Bank. If the import is a necessity, foreign exchange will be supplied as much as possible, otherwise it will not be supplied. As for which are necessities and which are non-necessities, since it involves various industries greatly, no official announcement has been seen to date. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Imports of luxury goods have been sharply reduced, and the overall import surplus has been reduced as a result. The following is a comparison of the imports of luxury goods in the past three years:</p>

<h3>Japanese Warship Damaged and Towed to Shanghai - Workers Unwilling to Repair - Traitor Seizes Profit and Contracts for Urgent Repairs - Workers Understand the Greater Good and Will Not Be Used</h3>
<p>After the Japanese side suffered heavy casualties in the Wuhan campaign due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army, they were safely ordered to withdraw the main force without loss, but the Japanese side suffered heavy losses. Among them, the Japanese naval fleet repeatedly tried to break through the Yangtze River blockade line on the outskirts of Wuhan and was fired upon by the Chinese army and bombed by aircraft, resulting in heavy casualties. Recently, one of the largest Japanese transport ships, with a deadweight of 15,000 to 16,000 tons, was sunk by Chinese aircraft in Jiangxi. The Japanese dispatched several crane ships to salvage it and towed it to Shanghai a few days ago, where it was opened to the No. 3 dock of the former Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. It is said that the repair project of the "Kamui Maru" is still contracted by the traitorous merchant Wu Ashun and others, priced at 23,000 yuan. Because the Japanese Navy urgently needs the ship to transport soldiers, the deadline for completion is three weeks. Wu Ashun has been going around recruiting skilled workers from the former Jiangnan Shipyard to work in Nanshi, and each person is given a few yuan of salary in advance. The workers of the shipyard, in this time of national crisis, are acting with patriotic conscience and refusing to be used by traitors, and have refused with strong words. Under the pressure of hunger and cold, the workers deeply understand the greater good, which is admirable.</p>
<h3>Income Tax in This City - Last Year's Situation Was Good - Increase in Profits from Business Operations and Interest</h3>
<p>Income tax is one of the direct good taxes of the country. Since its collection began in the 25th year, the total national income has not been able to meet the original budget due to changes in the situation and the fact that it has not been promoted for long. The entire income tax revenue has now been clearly designated as the guarantee for the 27th year's national defense public debt. Therefore, the position of income tax in the entire wartime finance is even more important. It is learned that the situation of income tax collection in this city was that in the 25th year, it accounted for more than two-fifths of the national total. In the 26th year, companies and firms paid profits from business operations enthusiastically, accounting for an important position in the total revenue, and income from government bonds and deposit interest also accounted for the majority. The situation changed dramatically in the 27th year. The damage to industry and commerce was extremely severe, and it is not yet possible to know what the composition of future collections will be. However, according to the current situation, it is actually still good, because under the abnormal development of industry and commerce in this city, business operations are very developed. At the end of the year, most accounts show profits, and the small income tax can be paid in full. Moreover, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has informed various industry associations to notify member companies and firms to pay together to increase national treasury revenue and maintain the important position of income tax in the entire finance. Therefore, it is expected that the collection of income tax in the 27th year, in addition to temporary profits and salaries of civil servants, the income from profits of companies and firms and the income from interest on government bonds and deposits will certainly exceed the numbers of the 25th and 26th years.</p>

<h3>Tsinghua Alumni Association to Hold a Social Gathering</h3>
<p>Although most members of the Shanghai Tsinghua Alumni Association have left Shanghai one after another due to work-related reasons, there are still quite a few members. It is learned that the association, in order to connect with all alumni, has decided to hold a dinner and social gathering at the East Hall on the 9th floor of the YMCA in Baixianqiao starting at 7:00 PM on the 6th of this month (Friday), with various excellent programs to add to the fun. In addition to inviting Dr. Yan Huiqing to give a speech, music is the most exciting item. There will be male and female soprano and bass solos and choruses accompanied by various instruments, and violin solos. In addition to the well-known French couple Mr. and Mrs. Gautova in Shanghai, the performers are all people with rich musical literacy, such as Ms. Huang Youkui and Mr. Si Yigui. Some are famous Western songs, some are masterpieces of the late Professor Huang Zi of the National Conservatory of Music and Music Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and some are excellent works of the current Music Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Professor Li Weining of the National Conservatory of Music. The conductor is also Mr. Li. Therefore, the value of this performance is very high and cannot be compared to ordinary performances. It is said that each admission ticket is only sold for two yuan in national currency, and people have been enthusiastically buying them in recent days.</p>
<h3>People from Dinghai in Shanghai Received News from Their Hometown Police Yesterday - Large Numbers of Pirates Running Rampant - Marine Police Were Prevented from Landing</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources in this city yesterday, the situation in Dinghai is extremely bad. Large numbers of pirates first robbed Xiaqi, then Taohua, and recently coveted the city of Chu, causing residents to panic and be startled several times a night. The officials and gentry of the county, believing that the police force was weak and unable to suppress them, telegraphed the Haimen authorities to dispatch capable marine police to Dinghai to assist in the suppression. Unexpectedly, before the marine police arrived, the pirates had already landed at Qutou, causing great panic among the residents. On the morning of the day before yesterday, the US Mei Da transport ship of the American Mei Li Company arrived in Dinghai from Haimen. The ship was carrying a large number of marine police who intended to dock immediately. When the pirates saw the arrival of the marine police, they immediately opened fire to resist arrest. The marine police were unable to land, and the ship was forced to turn back to Zhushanmen and anchor for a moment. After the marine police hired a small boat to land, the ship sailed to Ningbo. After hearing the news, people from Dinghai in Shanghai telegraphed to inquire, but as of yesterday evening, no reply had been received. Therefore, the situation thereafter is unknown.</p>
<h3>Loss of Deposit Slips, Passbooks, and Seals: Banks Adopt Notarization Method, Aiming to Reduce Bank Liability and Protect Depositors</h3>
<p>When depositors request to report the loss of bank deposit slips, passbooks, and seals used for withdrawals, banks have traditionally required depositors to publish a notice in the newspaper and provide a guarantor. This method could be barely applicable in normal times. However, since the outbreak of war, the industry has gradually found this method difficult, as the number of loss incidents has been increasing daily, and the cumulative amount has become enormous. The risk borne by the banks is excessively high, and it is also difficult for depositors to find a guarantor. Considering both the bank's responsibility and the convenience of depositors, it seems necessary to seek alternative remedies. The Shanghai Bank suggested to the Bankers Association to adopt a notarization method as a remedy. The association then sent letters to various banks to solicit their opinions and also sent a letter to the court requesting instructions. The Banking Association's Practical Research Committee, based on the opinions of various parties and the information provided by various banks, held several meetings to discuss and make several decisions. The conclusions of the discussion were sent to the Bankers Association for reference. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency, considering the importance of the matter, specially added the original letter as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, Regarding the problem of loss of deposit slips, passbooks, and seals, the Banking Practice Research Committee of this association has held multiple meetings to discuss it. As a result, it is generally agreed that during this wartime period, if the loss of passbooks, deposit slips, and seals is still handled according to the traditional methods of various banks, requiring depositors to publish a notice in the newspaper and provide a guarantor, it will be quite difficult. From the depositor's point of view, they are moving around, unfamiliar with the area, and finding a guarantor is quite difficult. For those with larger deposits, they feel even more helpless. From the bank's point of view, the depositor's declaration in the newspaper that the item is void is not enough to relieve the bank's liability. Currently, loss incidents are increasing daily, and there is a need for another remedy. This association proposes three principles for resolving this case: (1) A cooperative method must be sought to reduce the bank's liability; (2) Detailed regulations must be in place to protect depositors; (3) The procedure must be simplified to reduce the depositor's expenses. Research has shown that although the traditional method of providing a guarantor and publishing a notice meets the principle of simplified procedure, it clearly does not meet the above two principles. As for the owner applying to the local court for public summons and a judgment of exclusion of rights, although there are provisions for this in the regulations (in the past, there was no such need in practice, and depositors applying to the court for public summons were rare before the war), but according to the provisions of the Civil Procedure Law, the procedure for public summons and judgment of exclusion of rights only applies to securities. A seal is not a security, and can a deposit slip be interpreted as a security? The court's views are also inconsistent. Recently, in the Shanghai First Special District and Hankou, there have been cases of applying to the court for public summons due to the loss of passbooks, and the rulings of the local district courts are completely different, making it feel that it is not applicable. Even if the public summons procedure can be used, the time required is very long, and the cost of publishing in the newspaper is very high, which causes considerable pain to the parties involved, especially for small depositors, which is quite contrary to the above third principle. Moreover, filing a confirmation lawsuit with the court is even more difficult in terms of law and fact. It is unreasonable to make the deposit bank the plaintiff. If the deposit bank is the defendant, the deposit bank itself is not the party at fault. The depositor is the one who failed to keep it safe. According to the law, the bank has no reason to lose the case. Moreover, after the plaintiff wins the first instance, the deposit bank will inevitably file appeals in the second and third instances, dragging out the litigation and increasing the loss. In fact, it is not a feasible method. After repeated discussions, this association believes that under the current special circumstances, in order to reduce the bank's liability and at the same time consider the convenience of protecting depositors, comparatively speaking, adopting the notarization method suggested by the Shanghai Bank is the most appropriate (omitted). However, it is doubtful whether this method falls within the scope of statutory notarization. If it is decided to adopt this method at present, it seems that your association should submit a request to the Judicial Yuan or the Ministry of Judicial Administration for interpretation. If it is considered feasible, please instruct the courts in various places to accept it. If your association can send representatives to the judicial authorities to explain the whole matter in detail, it would be even more comprehensive. The above is the result of the discussion of the Banking Practice Research Committee of this association. It is excerpted and sent for your reference. Please consider it carefully. It is said that the member banks of the Bankers Association have already adopted the notarization method.</p>
<p>Salary Dispute</p>
<p>Chen Lianzhou, currently residing at No. 131 Museum Road, formerly at Room 106, No. 457 Hankou Road, is involved in a salary dispute with Jin Zhongying, the owner of the Yuye Company. The case is in court. Now, Chen Lianzhou has submitted a statement to the court requesting preservation of evidence. It is claimed that the petitioner was commissioned by Jin Zhongying, the owner of the China Yuye Company, in September of the 25th year of the Republic of China as the manager of the company's mining department, with an agreement of 1,900 yuan. Apart from receiving 560 yuan, there is still 1,340 yuan owed, which has not been paid. The petitioner lives in the Chinese district of Huajie Min Road, which was destroyed during the Shanghai war last year. Only the company's account books can be used as evidence. However, the company has also ceased operations, and all account books are temporarily stored in Room 106, No. 457 Hankou Road, without any responsible personnel in charge. There is a risk of loss. The court sent personnel to deliver the documents a few days ago and has verified all these circumstances, as seen in the bailiff's report. These account books are sufficient to prove that the petitioner should receive his monthly salary. The court is requested to approve the preservation and deposit all the above-mentioned account books with the court as evidence. It is heard that the court will rule to provide for safekeeping, and it is also heard that this case will continue to be heard soon.</p>
<p>Jingan Temple Post Office New Year Dinner Party</p>
<p>All the staff of the Jingan Temple Post Office in this city, in order to strengthen their relationships and celebrate the victory of the National Army's resistance war in the 28th year of the Republic of China, held a dinner party at the Hongyunlou Restaurant on Wuma Road on the second day of the new year. More than 100 employees attended. During the dinner, they toasted and exchanged drinks, and the atmosphere was very lively. The decision to hold this dinner party was to completely eliminate all bad habits and extravagant consumption. Moreover, in view of the fact that the market is full of inferior goods, and it is difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake, and due to environmental factors, the propaganda methods cannot be fully utilized, resulting in the almost complete deprivation of the market for domestic goods, the organizers pre-requested various products from major domestic goods factories and stores as prizes. Each participating employee drew lots to determine the amount of prizes in order to widely promote domestic goods. The meaning is very profound. The companies and factories that donated products include Zhonghua Book Company, Commercial Press, Buddhist Bookstore, Shanghai Candy Factory, Datong Tobacco Company, Xietai Bulb Factory, Baoyuan Paper Store, Guoguang Harmonica Factory, Rongye Paper Bag Factory, Xinchang White Factory, Taiyitang Chinese Medicine Store, Wang Hexing, Jingming Glass Factory, Zhongfa Pharmaceutical Factory, Kangyuan Canning Factory, Xingguang Toy Company, Home Industry Cooperative, Fountain Pen Hospital, Zhongfa Pharmacy, Qianxin Sauce Shop, and other major companies and factories. All of these are goods of excellent quality and are a grand event.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang East Tea Representatives Conference Discusses Important Cases such as Inspection and Loan, Three-Day Conference Concludes in Ningbo</h3>
<p>In order to improve tea production and coordinate inspection and other issues, the counties in eastern Zhejiang recently convened a tea industry representatives conference in Ningbo, which lasted for three days.

<h3>Multiple Car Accidents in the Eastern District of Shanghai, German Car Collides with Japanese Car, French Concession's Prevention of Accidents Proves Effective</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, at about 1 p.m. yesterday (the 2nd), a German drove his private car to visit the war zone. At the intersection of Tangshan Road and Zhaofeng Road in the Huishan District, it collided with a public bus operated and driven by a Japanese. As a result, a German woman residing in the Broadway Mansion was injured in the private car. Fortunately, the injury was not serious, and she was sent back to her home. However, the car was severely damaged. Also, at 8:15 a.m. on New Year's Day, a Chinese driver drove</p>
<p>A German Truck</p>
<p>A German truck collided with a Japanese three-wheeled motorcycle at the intersection of Yuanfang Road and East Broadway Road. The motorcycle belonged to the Japanese Marine Corps and was driven by a Japanese Marine soldier. A Japanese student was sitting in the sidecar and another in the back seat. The collision was extremely violent. The motorcycle even caught fire, and the student in the sidecar was burned to death. Another student was also injured. However, the Marine soldier was apparently not injured. Yesterday, a senior official of the French Concession Police Department told reporters that</p>
<p>New Year Holidays</p>
<p>During the New Year holidays, there were no major car accidents in the French Concession. However, the police department is definitely conducting a campaign to reduce many truck accidents. Special patrolmen are stationed in the more busy thoroughfares of the French Concession to patrol. Day and night, they can stop heavy trucks at any time and use special equipment to test the braking performance of the vehicle. This campaign began two months ago. It is difficult to have an accurate calculation of accidents and make a comparison with those in 1937. They definitely hope that this year's</p>
<p>Fatal Accidents</p>
<p>The number of fatal accidents can be greatly reduced. There were 51 car accidents that resulted in death last year, but since the outbreak of war in 1937, traffic in the French Concession has become increasingly busy. They have various reasons to believe that if the braking performance is carefully tested on time and found to be below standard, a fine will be imposed. As a result, the number of deaths and injuries caused by traffic accidents must be reduced. When the reporter asked whether ordinary cars would also be tested in the same way, the official said that they were not tested because the police department did not want to cause unnecessary inconvenience to pedestrians. However, if the police department believes that it will be necessary to test ordinary passenger cars in the future, it will also do so.</p>
<h3>Huang Tianhuan Steals a Huge Amount of Money from His Master, Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment for Continuous Theft, His Nephew Yanping Detained for 30 Days</h3>
<p>Huang Tianhuan, a servant from Nanhai, Guangdong, who worked for Chen Qibiao at No. 80 Seymour Road, stole a huge amount of property from his employer and spent it all at the Changsheng Pawnshop. After the crime was discovered, he fled. The victim reported it to the police, and the detectives first arrested Huang Yanping, Huang's nephew, who was living at Huang's residence, for trying to withdraw US$2,000 from Citibank using the stolen deposit book. Then, Tianhuan was intercepted at the pier as he was about to board the Dingsheng Ferry to Shantou. He was also apprehended and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that the principal offender, Huang Tianhuan, also known as A Niu, is only 21 years old. He was hired by the Chen residence, first as a servant boy, and later promoted to manager, earning a monthly salary of ten yuan. His motivation for theft began in the spring when he happened to find two keys to the master's inner room. He privately opened the boxes and cabinets and also obtained the key to the iron box, which he also opened. The contents of the box, besides 500 yuan in legal tender and deposit books for US$2,000 and over 800 yuan in legal tender, were all gold and silver jewelry, utensils, jade ornaments, and other items. Since then, Tianhuan has been able to take and carry them at will without any scruples. This iron box had not been opened by the Chen family for several years. Tianhuan pawned everything he stole, but at first he pawned and redeemed them. Since autumn, gambling dens in the Caojiadu area of ​​western Shanghai have been flourishing. Among them, the "Rongsheng Company" is larger in scale and has many ways to cheat money. The general pig herders are rushing to it because the place can cater to their preferences. Tianhuan also indulged in it, and often lost in gambling. Therefore, every time he lost, he stole the contents of the box and pawned them as bets, so that the pawned items were never redeemed. Currently, there are 79 pawn tickets that have been found. According to the police's estimate, the value of the items recorded on them is as high as 9,800 yuan, while the amount Tianhuan received from pawning them was only 2,300 yuan. On the day of his arrest, he only had 50 yuan of legal tender left on him, enough to prove that the remaining 2,200 yuan and the stolen 500 yuan of legal tender had all been offered to the so-called "Rongsheng Company" in half a year. The only thing he gained from it was a copper badge that he did not have time to take with him when he fled, which was left in his bedroom and searched out by the detectives. In addition, 40 unscratched lottery tickets for the grand lottery were also found. The police then interrogated the suspect based on the evidence obtained. He confessed to the whole process of stealing property, gambling debts, and absconding in four stages without any concealment. Yesterday, the police escorted the two Huangs to the First Special Court. Judge Fang Qinghai conducted a preliminary hearing. Police attorney Jiang Baolian stated the facts, presented the stolen goods and the badges issued to gamblers by "Rongsheng Company," and requested severe punishment. Huang Tianhuan confessed to all his actions. However, Huang Yanping claimed that his uncle had tricked him into withdrawing money from the bank and hired lawyer Huang Yuping to plead for leniency. The court verified the confessions and sentenced Huang Tianhuan to three years imprisonment for continuous theft and Huang Yanping to 30 days of detention for transporting stolen goods. The stolen goods and money were returned to the original owner.</p>
<p>Jin Zigang Passes Away</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Zigang, former editor of the North China Daily News, passed away at his residence in this city yesterday morning. Mr. Jin was 65 years old and a graduate of Beiyang Engineering School.

<p>Notorious Robber Cai Wanbao and Others Sentenced Separately, Heaviest Sentence is Seven Years, Lightest is One Month</p>
<p>Zhu Hanpo, a Chinese detective of the Gordon Road Police Station, together with Chinese and Western detectives, arrested a group of notorious robbers from Jiangbei, including Cai Wanbao, Li Xizhen, Li Er, Li Fengming, Xu Jigong, and the old man He Hongqian who possessed firearms, his daughter He Xinbao, and others, at tea houses on Laobeisheng Road and at Mabailu and Dongjinglu, etc., on the morning of the 2nd of last month. They seized a Mauser pistol and a hand box, 33 rounds of ammunition, and two hand grenades. After investigation, it was found that since February of last year to October of this year, they had formed a gang and robbed the Wang family on Binlang Road, Wang Chengtai at No. 317 Maqi Road, and Huang Yangmin at No. 10 Lane 47 Chengdu Road, stealing property worth more than 600 yuan. Wang San, who is still at large, also opened fire and killed a Sige detective, Wang Mingfu. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and confession. Yesterday, Judge Jiang presided over the court and sentenced Cai Wanbao to seven years imprisonment, Xu Jigong to five years and six months, Li Xizhen, Li Fengming, and Li Er to five years each, He Hongqian to three months, and He Xinbao to one month. The evidence was confiscated.</p>

<p>Police Received the Report</p>
<p>And sent Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene of the accident, detaining the driver Wang Jinfu and taking him back to the police station. They took photos at the scene of the accident and sent the two bodies to the morgue for autopsy. The Zhang corpse was claimed by his family, and the unknown corpse was buried by the hall. The police sent the defendant Wang Jinfu to the Second Special Court for interrogation, detention, and investigation. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. The French Concession authorities are now prosecuting Wang for the crime of causing death by negligence in the course of his duties.</p>
<p>Filed a Public Prosecution</p>
<p>The case was heard by Judge Sun Pengxian the other day. The police attorney Chen Ming stated the investigation process. When Wang Jinfu was questioned, he confessed that when he was driving to the intersection of Edward Road and Beller Road, he saw a young deceased (referring to Zhang Miaorong, who died first) rushing diagonally from north to south in front of his car. He immediately tried to avoid him to the left, but the deceased still rushed over, causing him to be knocked down and crushed to death. He was unable to brake in time, and the car continued to drive forward, causing another death. It was impossible to avoid it. Then, the Western detectives from the Transportation Department reported</p>
<p>Investigation Process</p>
<p>And presented a map of the scene of the accident. The court verified the confessions and ordered a postponement for further investigation of the case. The defendant was remanded in custody. Regarding the loss of the victim Zhang Miaorong, it is heard that the company has negotiated with the corpse's family to give appropriate compensation. However, there is still no corpse's family to claim the body of the unknown man and request compensation.</p>
<p>Why Commit Suicide? One Man and One Woman Have Died</p>
<p>Swallowing Lamp Oil</p>
<p>Huang Yu, a local woman residing at No. 33 Junyi Lane, Aierjin Road, is 37 years old. Yesterday morning at about 10:40, she had an argument with her husband and then had the idea of ending her life. She secretly swallowed lamp oil in an attempt to commit suicide. After her family discovered it, they urgently called an ambulance and rushed her to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Female Servant Hangs Herself</p>
<p>A female servant of a certain family at No. 7 Chunyong Lane, next to the Paramount Hotel on Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai, suddenly hanged herself in her room yesterday afternoon after 4:00 p.m. After her mistress discovered it, she urgently tried to save her and sent her to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died shortly after.</p>
<p>British National Falls from Building</p>
<p>At about 0:48 yesterday morning, an British national named Blan, 33 years old, somehow had the idea of ending his life and jumped from the fourth floor of No. 106 Beijing Road, Public Concession.

<p>Man Commits Suicide</p>
<p>At about 10:50 last night, a middle-aged man (in his thirties or forties), wearing a navy blue serge gown, yellow leather shoes, and a black felt hat, somehow had the idea of ending his life and jumped from a building at the Xinxin Company Amusement Park at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road. He fell in the middle of Lloyd Road, barely breathing, and suffered injuries to his head and abdomen. The Lao Zha Police Station guard No. 2120 rushed to the scene, called an ambulance, and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died shortly after. The French Chamber of Commerce's Charity Lottery for Refugees was established to raise funds for refugees. As of the fourth issue, it has provided relief funds amounting to 250,000 yuan. The fifth issue is scheduled to be drawn on the 12th of this month. If it can be sold in full, 60,000 French francs will be allocated to refugee funds. Considering that it only costs two yuan a month to support one refugee, the lottery is issued monthly, and the relief funds allocated each month are enough to support 30,000 refugees. If it is issued monthly and allocated on schedule, the refugee funds will be endless. Therefore, all Chinese people are praising, encouraging purchases, and vigorously promoting it. Now that the drawing date is approaching, to avoid missing out, please buy it quickly. If purchasing is troublesome, you can call the general sales office of the Dagong Enterprise Company in the city at 19049, and it will be delivered immediately. Mail orders from other cities are also welcome and will be returned promptly.</p>

<h3>Today's Wuxi Industry: Large Factories Mostly Rely on Others' Guidance, Small Silk Factories Can Achieve Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>— Caihua</p>
<p>Wuxi, one of China's four major rice markets and a key town on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, boasts the most developed industry in the province. Before the war, there were nine textile factories, over fifty silk factories, four flour mills, and over a hundred rice shops. Since the occupation over a year ago, Wuxi has been filled with dark clouds and evil shadows. All industries have suffered unprecedented devastation. Major factories have been monopolized by the Japanese, and even small businesses are controlled by them. Disguised subsidiaries of the Central China Silk Company and trading firms like Da Ji and Da Xing are holding Wuxi's industrial throat, preventing it from breathing. This article is merely a report on the current state of Wuxi industry, inevitably missing details. I respectfully request colleagues to supplement and correct it.</p>
<p>Textile Factories</p>
<p>Before the war, there were seven factories, including Shen, Zhenxin, Lixin, Guangqin, Yeqin, Qingfeng, and Yukang. Qingfeng and Shenxin factories were the largest in scale, while Lixin factory produced the most. Most of the factory buildings were destroyed, and many of the internal parts were also damaged. Shenxin and Zhenxin factories were repaired by personnel sent by the Japanese Shanghai Spinning Co., Ltd., while Yukang Yarn Factory was repaired by personnel sent by the Shanghai Dakang Yarn Factory. Weixin and Xiexin factories were established in October last year and briefly started operations when new cotton was available, but there was not much business.</p>
<p>Flour Mills</p>
<p>The flour mills suffered less damage than the silk and yarn industries. Fuxin and Maoxin factories suffered the most damage. Guangfeng Flour Mill has already started operations, and Jiufeng is preparing to do so. Of course, this kind of operation still reveals a miserable state, relying on the Japanese!</p>
<p>Silk Factories</p>
<p>The silk industry undoubtedly leads Wuxi's industry. In its heyday, there were over fifty silk factories, over 13,000 silk reeling machines, and over 60,000 workers. Now, the total number of silk reeling machines is less than a fraction of what it used to be, showing the state of the industry. However, the Japanese think it is profitable and are unwilling to let go, so they specially organized the "Central China Silk Company" to control it. The factories that have resumed operations include Zhenchang, Zhenyuan, Dasheng, Dingchang, Hongyu, Fulun, Runkang, Hefeng, Dingsheng, and nine others.</p>
<p>The so-called "Central China Silk Company" is a black box. The capital amount is nominally 8 million yuan, but in reality, it is probably worthless. Outsiders cannot know the details. The profit distribution is 60% to the Japanese and 40% to the Chinese. The purpose of the "Central China Company" is to control the silk industry in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang war zones. The head office is located in Hongkou, Shanghai, and branch offices are located in Wuxi and Suzhou. The "Wuxi Central China Silk Company" is located at the Maoziqiao Bridge in the city. The organization has a Japanese general manager. Under the general manager, each factory has a supervisor, who is also Japanese. The factory directors are Japanese, and the deputy factory directors are Chinese. There are three departments: sorting, engineering, and administration. The duties of each department are as follows: Sorting Department: opening factory, sorting room, inspection room; Engineering Department: raw material selection room, boiling room, silk reeling room, factory, warehouse, waste silk room, power room, repair room; Administrative Department: accounting, labor relief, general affairs, miscellaneous affairs. The details of the silk factories that have started operations are listed below:</p>
<p>At the same time, it is worth mentioning that some silk industry employees have a lot of integrity and creativity. On the one hand, they are unwilling to find work at the "Central China Company," and on the other hand, they cannot tighten their belts for the sake of their families. Under these circumstances, a large number of small family silk factories have emerged. These small silk factories have a maximum of eight to twelve silk reeling machines, and some have only four. The most have twenty machines. All the silk reeling machines and equipment were bought from the destroyed factories at extremely low prices of twenty to thirty yuan each. The so-called factory is in the home, with silk reeling machines and equipment installed simply. They work day and night, and the output is considerable, and they can also get considerable profits. "Self-reliance" is truly admirable!</p>
<p>Rice Industry</p>
<p>Next is the rice industry. Originally, the rice market was located in the area outside the North Gate. Because of the heavy losses suffered in the war, there are now about seventy rice shops that have resumed operations and newly established ones. The scope of business is not as large as before the war. Now, they are limited to small businesses in the city and cannot even talk about exporting. Even if they could export, they would have to cooperate with the Japanese. Not only are the donation and tax procedures troublesome, but there is also a great deal of risk.</p>
<p>In short, Wuxi's current industry is only one-tenth of what it was before the war. It is a black box, with grasping hands of exploitation everywhere. Instead of lingering under the heavy oppression of the Japanese, why not relocate the factories to the interior and engage in production needed for the war of resistance? This would not only allow the unemployed to return to the factories and participate in production, but also develop the industry in the interior, benefiting both the country and the nation!</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Prices Fluctuate Significantly in December</h3>
<p>Last December, the spot price of gold in the open market continued the trend of the previous month, hovering around 2,030 yuan for about two weeks. Then, as news of international loans gradually leaked out, the market was affected. After the loan announcement was made public, the market price fell sharply. In a few days, it entered the 2,000 yuan mark, reaching a low of 1,958 yuan on the 24th. Fortunately, the Hong Kong group continued to buy, without interruption, which helped maintain the market price and prevented it from falling further. Furthermore, Premier Chiang Kai-shek's statement that China would rather not surrender immediately boosted the market. At the same time, the Tianjin group also began to purchase. Under these two waves of buying, the market price once broke through the 2,000 yuan mark. Ultimately, due to inconsistent foreign exchange conditions and the year-end financial needs of local dealers, the bulls took profits, causing the price to fall back within the 2,000 yuan mark. Therefore, the spot market in the previous month can be described as trending from high to low, with a daily decline, which is also powerful evidence of the consolidation of the foundation of our national currency. As for trading, it was also less impressive. The total turnover was 19,040 taels, a decrease of over 4,000 taels compared to the previous month's 23,070 taels. The money exchange industry still maintained a buying position due to acting as an agent for the Hong Kong group, so the net inflow after offsetting purchases and sales was also over 4,000 taels. The securities industry was second, also on the buying side. Other industries, such as silver shops and spot gold dealers, were in a selling position. The turnover statistics of various industries in December are listed on the left (unit: taels):</p>
<p>Seller　Buyer　Net Inflow/Outflow</p>
<p>Money Exchange Industry　5,500　9,540　Inflow 4,040</p>
<p>Gold Dealers　5,470　3,770　Outflow 1,700</p>
<p>Silver Shops　6,510　3,860　Outflow 2,690</p>
<p>Visiting Dealers　700　310　Outflow 390</p>
<p>Securities Industry　860　1,560　Inflow 700</p>
<p>Total　19,040 taels</p>
<h3>Silver Prices Rise by 10 Annas</h3>
<p>Bombay, 2nd. Silver spot prices suddenly increased by 10 annas, futures by 11 annas. Also, New York reports that the price of American silver is still quoted but no transactions are taking place, maintaining the original price. The price of British silver bars is suspended, no report is available.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Green Sugar Rises with Brown and White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten. The association's quoted price for Taikoo sugar was 23.8 yuan per B mark for delivery at Pudong godown, a rebound of 30 cents; 24 yuan for delivery at Puxi godown, with refunds offered for lower grades. Grade 24 Dutch raw white sugar was 24.4 yuan, transit sugar was 16.2 yuan. For domestic sugar, the Chaozhou group quoted medium grade refined white sugar at 21.5 yuan, also an increase from before. Since the tightening of refined brown sugar, it has gradually become firmer. Yesterday, the high brand refined brown sugar opened at 15.25 to 15.3 yuan, the second grade at 14.65 yuan, and the lowest grade at 12.8 yuan. Green sugar was active due to the rise in brown and white sugar. Common grade sugar opened at 12.6 yuan, Huanggang green at 12 yuan, and the second grade at 11.7 to 11.5 yuan, with a total of 2,500 to 2,600 bags traded. According to a letter from Quanzhou, the current new sugar harvest is poor, only four to five tenths of last year's.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn and Cotton Market to Open on the 5th, Still Hopeful for an Uptrend</h3>
<p>Due to the financial industry's holiday at the beginning of the year, the local yarn and cotton market was naturally unable to be active. According to the opinions of most industry members, it is predicted that the market will open on the 5th. Barring unexpected stimuli, there is hope for an upturn in the cotton industry. However, it is noted that speculators in the market and banks are heavily stockpiling cotton cloth, and public opinion is that China's position on the war of resistance is consistent. The inspection of imported goods in the interior is very strict. In this regard, there should be continued and unremitting demand for China-British yarn. However, at the end of last year, hoarding was full, and speculative transactions exceeded actual transactions by a factor of one. If prices are too high after the market opens, there is a deep fear that those who want to take profits will come out, and there may be a decline or softening. However, the amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth exported to Chaozhou, Shantou, Kunming, Haiphong, Yunnan, etc. has been large recently. The same steps are being taken in eastern Zhejiang, so the foundation of the market is moving towards a healthier path.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Japanese Pagoda Flower Seeds Trending Firm</h3>
<p>Japanese Pagoda Flower Seeds from Huai Prefecture and Hao Prefecture are scarce in both shipments and inventories. Although the demand is not particularly strong, the trend is very firm. Yesterday, the market was sold at 23 yuan. Tianjin goods are difficult to arrange due to high external costs and exchange rates, so inventory is fully available.</p>
<h3>Peach Kernel Prices Advancing</h3>
<p>Peach kernels are of the highest quality when from Lanxi, and those produced in Jiangxi are next. Previously, the market sold for 32 yuan per dan. As sales continued, the bottom gradually felt lacking, and recent sources are scarce and external expenses are more cumbersome. The cost of arrangements is 40 yuan, so the current market has risen to 45 yuan, and its momentum is stable.</p>
<h3>Grain: Highland Rice in Very Strong Demand</h3>
<p>After Highland Rice and Superior Rice were both closed for two days, the demand on this street was extremely greedy. Especially the low prices of goods from the big market were welcomed by retail customers, so the buying was extremely strong in the morning. Prices for medium and lower grades all rose by a few cents, while high-quality goods were mostly not formally delivered due to the insistence of the cargo owners. Because the cost has increased after the goods were purchased by Japanese merchants and directly re-exported from the production area, not only has the cost increased, but also transportation is difficult. Therefore, both newly arrived and previously stored goods are intended to be firmly held to await better prices. Although the market rose by a few cents yesterday, only more than 1,000 bags were traded. Common grade Wu rice opened at 9.6 to 9.7 cents, and high-quality Wu rice required more than 10 yuan. Nanjing special Chungpu rice was shouted at 10.45 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Rain Increases Rice Prices, 20,000 Dan Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market in Xiahe reopened as usual. There were more than thirty boats, including steamers and truck shipments, totaling about 10,000 bags. Transactions in the city's rice shops were busier because store needs were more frequent after the New Year's holiday for two days. Ship owners, on the other hand, said that rice prices in the interior had risen sharply by 30 to 40 cents, and there was fear that sources would not be able to be further increased. Moreover, people are happier with the rain, and the market immediately raised prices. Nearly 20,000 dan were traded throughout the day. New rice and Bojing rice each rose by one or two cents, and Dujian, Yangjian, and Pujian rice followed suit, with cent increases. Glutinous rice was sold quickly, and the increase was even more urgent. The highest price for Liyang goods has reached 13.6 to 13.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: White Lead Wire Sales Gradually Moving</h3>
<p>The white lead wire market has been quiet for a long time. However, its trend has shown promise in recent days. Architectural and Fujian groups are purchasing, and interior groups are also inquiring, so the market situation is very lively. Although the market has not improved for the time being, those holding goods are still unwilling to sell cheaply, so the standard remains steady. More than 300 bundles were opened yesterday. Coarse patterns were sold for 15.25 yuan, medium grade patterns for 15.75 yuan, and fine patterns for 16.2 yuan. As no new goods have arrived and market inventories are running dry, the future market situation is very promising.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices at the Beginning of the Year Rise Immediately</h3>
<p>The various types of white coal have seen increased sales recently due to the severe cold weather. Local shop owners and inland merchants have shown interest, and the market has become increasingly tight. Yesterday, the new year trading session opened and immediately saw prices rise. Hongqi lump coal was priced at 50 yuan per ton, cut lump at 48 yuan, medium lump at 45 yuan, small lump at 46 yuan, and coal dust remained at the original price, without much change. This is because the arrival of lump coal has been scarce lately, and warehouse stocks are very low, so prices have to be raised to show restrictions.</p>
<h3>Canada Calculation of Gold Production Costs</h3>
<p>The Royal Bank of Canada's December report states that during the recent economic downturn, the economic stability of Canada has been significantly assisted by the gold mining industry. From 1935 to 1937, Canada's gold production was abundant, with a total production of 4,096,215 ounces in 1937. In the first eight months of this year, the production amount was 3,051,081 ounces, while in the same period last year it was 2,672,812 ounces. Therefore, the production in 1938 is expected to have a new record.</p>
<p>So, what kind of assistance does the gold mining industry have for the social economy? The recent analysis by the Bureau of Internal Affairs Statistics is as follows: Canadian gold mining companies, excluding employee salaries, spent more than 40 million U.S. dollars on industrial equipment, electricity, fuel, water, insurance, etc. in 1937. If the same investigation is done for the 1935 fiscal year, the expenses have increased by more than 40% in the past two years. As the cash mining industry continues to develop, its contribution to the promotion and success of other industries in Canada will inevitably increase day by day. In 1937, gold mining industry expenditures included more than one million yuan for mining drills and parts, 1.25 million yuan for lead and iron pipe equipment, 1.5 million yuan for electrical equipment, 1.01 million yuan for steel purchases, more than 5 million yuan for machine purchases, 2.85 million yuan for wood, and 1.32 million yuan for other building materials. At the same time, the chemical and related industries also benefited significantly, such as dynamite consumption worth 4.7 million yuan, "alloy decay products" worth 1.46 million yuan, other chemical products worth 500,000 yuan, and electricity consumption worth 4.51 million yuan. But this is only the main driving force. As for kerosene and gasoline, it requires 957,000 yuan, coal requires 760,000 yuan, railway freight requires 2.41 million yuan, and workers' insurance premiums and other insurance premiums total more than 2.62 million yuan. With a consumption of 40 million yuan, which is used from one industry to another, the amount is considerable. However, it is still not enough. In 1939, the gold mining industry employed a total of 25,000 miners, with wage expenditures reaching 58 million yuan. Then, combining the calculations, the total expenditure of the gold mining industry in 1937 was close to 100 million yuan. (A)</p>

<h3>New Year's Hopes</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Time flies so fast: The 27th year has passed like a flash!</p>
<p>When we look back on this year, have we done our best to help our compatriots in distress? In today's situation where the whole country has suffered from war, we live in Shanghai and live a safe and comfortable life. Are we suspected of despising the disaster?</p>
<p>The New Year is here! Every household is full of joy. In this joyful sound, let us not forget the miserable situation of the compatriots in distress! Don't have meaningless joy! It is shameful to say that the four million compatriots living in Shanghai cannot help the tens of thousands of refugees in Shanghai to escape their painful lives! How can we not feel heartache when we see the refugees sleeping on the cement pavements next to the road!</p>
<p>From now on, we should strive to save people from disaster and engage in meaningful work!</p>
<p>I hope that in the 28th year:</p>
<p>(1) To enable compatriots sleeping in the open to spend the winter safely,</p>
<p>(2) To ensure that all refugees in the shelters are supported!</p>
<p>(3) To give homeless children on the streets food and clothing; and opportunities to receive education.</p>
<p>(4) To provide the children who sell newspapers in the morning and evening with opportunities to study at the newspaper boy school when they are not working!</p>
<p>This is a minimum hope!</p>
<p>We know that saving refugees is saving the country. Saving one more refugee is saving one more of the nation's vitality. We should participate in the work of saving people from disaster and make it the central work of the 28th year. I hope that the compatriots in Shanghai will work together to put it into practice!</p>
<p>New Year Games</p>
<h3>Guessing Age</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In the New Year's Eve celebration at school, there were wonderful programs such as singing and dancing. Among them, a clever child performed a game of guessing age. His method is very simple and very interesting. Now I will write down the game.</p>
<p>Juemin--"The New Year is here and we are all getting a year older. Today I am going to guess everyone's age. Who wants me to guess? "Yihua busy said:" Please guess how old I am this year? "</p>
<p>Juemin: "Okay! Now I write down a formula "89×9×your age" and put your age into the formula, and then calculate it carefully. Don't make any mistakes, show me the answer - I can guess your age.</p>
<p>Yihua - turned his back to Juemin and put his age of 11 into the formula, which became "". After calculating, he showed the answer "" to Juemin.</p>
<p>Juemin glanced at it and said, "You are eleven years old, right?"</p>
<p>Yihua: "Ah! How can you be so accurate? What's the reason?"</p>
<p>Juemin: "Look! Aren't the last two digits of the answer "eleven"? So I can immediately say "eleven". Do you know that the last two digits are the reason for your age?"</p>
<p>Yihua thought for a while and clapped his hands and laughed: "I know, I know, "" multiplied by age, of course the last two digits are the number of age. "</p>
<p>Juemin smiled and said: "That's right! But I can also guess your age and date of birth."</p>
<p>Yihua: "Good! Good! That's even better!"</p>
<p>Juemin: He wrote down a formula: He said to Yihua: "Put your age and date of birth into each position, calculate it carefully, show me the exact answer, and I can guess it!"</p>
<p>Yihua is eleven years old this year and was born on September 14th, so he put these numbers into the formula and calculated it. Then he gave the answer to Juemin to guess: Juemin calculated it and said, "You were born on September 14th, right?"</p>
<p>Yihua said, "How did you know that?"</p>
<p>Juemin: "This is very simple. In short, no matter who's age and date of birth you guess, just subtract "" from his answer. In this number: the two digits before the decimal point are the birthday; the two digits after the decimal point are the age; the last two digits are the birth month. Now look!" In this number, aren't the two numbers after the decimal point ""? Aren't the last two digits ""? Aren't the two numbers before the decimal point "one thousand"?</p>
<p>So I know you were born on September 14th.</p>
<p>Yihua clapped his hands and laughed, "Yes! Yes! This method is really interesting."</p>
<p>If you have read the above game, you may also try it. See if it's right or not.</p>
<h3>Moving Bicycle</h3>
<p>— Yunyu</p>
<p>When the New Year comes, we often see many students and teenagers riding bicycles on the road. They have money, as long as they spend two angles on the car rental, they can ride on the car, which is really carefree, but what about the refugees in the shelter? They have no money and no chance to play, which is really boring. Now we also have a bicycle here, which can be played by anyone without charging car rental. Friends, are you happy or not?</p>
<p>This car is flexible and its speed is also very fast (see picture). Friends, don't you believe it? Wait a minute, you'll know after a try.</p>
<p>(1) First, cut out the pattern on the paper, and carefully look at the structure of the car, its style, which is the style of a sports car, so its speed is lighter than ordinary bicycles. Please take a closer look first.</p>
<p>(2) Then you can focus on the two discs, while constantly shaking in your hands - (like sifting grain) shaking for a minute.</p>
<p>(3) Finally, you can stop immediately and see if the two wheels are turning? Ha! Do you think it's strange? It simply turns so fast that you don't believe it. The faster you move, the faster it turns. If you keep going, it will turn until you are dizzy.</p>
<p>What is the reason? Who wants it to turn? Scientists tell us that this is an "illusion" of the eyes.</p>
<p>He said that usually when we look at something with our eyes, if we stare at it for too long, we will often see two shapes. For example, a table, as long as we are in a daze, in addition to a real table, we can also see the outline of a virtual table, which is the "illusion". Due to the effect of "illusion", we see two shapes.</p>
<p>Then, let's think about it. After this car has been watched after the first item, we have already been in a daze. Then we keep shaking the paper and continue to do the second work. Is there any reason why an illusion will not occur?</p>
<p>Understanding the reason, we can also understand the reason for "moving movies", because the structure of movies is also related to "illusion", but movies are not what we want to talk about in this article, so we don't need to talk about it too much.</p>
<h3>This Week's War</h3>
<p>These days, the weather is cold. People on the isolated island are still afraid of the cold when they are in the house. When it comes to the war on the front line, it really makes people sigh.</p>
<p>Southern China</p>
<p>A few days ago, it was reported in the newspaper that more than 100 Japanese warships were concentrated in Beihai, and the situation was tense. When the news came, we felt that the situation in South China would change, because the Japanese army recently felt that the stalemate in the war in South China was difficult. There has to be a concentration of counter-offensive preparations. According to a Hong Kong telegram on the 23rd, the situation in the southern part of Kwangtung Province is very tense. Japanese warships are now gathered in Yangjiang, Dianbai, Beihai and other places, trying to seize the opportunity to land, and constantly firing artillery at the shore as an attempt to land. At the same time, the Japanese air force is also very active, flying to various places to scout and throw bombs. Now the war has broken out in Beihai Dianbai. The telegram also said that Japanese warships outside Beihai Port were constantly firing artillery to cover the landing of troops, but because the Chinese army's defense was tight, it has not succeeded so far. At present, the Chinese side has declared martial law and destroyed all the transportation routes leading to the mainland to prevent the Japanese army from invading Guangxi from there.</p>
<p>This news was still news from the beginning of the week. Up to the 31st, looking at the overall war in South China, it can be said that there has been no progress at all. This is not because the Japanese army is slackening on the war, but because the Chinese side is properly equipped and morale is high. Therefore, the latest news has always been in the chaos. According to the telegram from Qujiang, not only has the Japanese army made no progress, but the positions of Shengangxu, Dagangling and other positions in Conghua have been shaken by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>"The Qujiang telegram said that the Japanese army entrenched in Bietou was defeated by the Chinese army and retreated to Conghua. A certain unit of the Chinese army immediately divided and attacked Conghua. The Japanese army was extremely panic and retreated to the south. The Chinese army recovered Conghua City. In addition to sending troops to pursue, they also occupied the positions in Shengangxu, Dagangling and other areas."</p>
<p>According to a Reuters Hong Kong telegram: "According to news received here, the Chinese army in Beijiang began to attack Huaxian yesterday. Fierce battles are underway. The street fighting in Zengcheng is still extremely fierce. A Japanese team moved westward from Luofu Mountain yesterday in an attempt to rescue the Japanese army in Zengcheng, but was ambushed on the way. There is no major change in the Xijiang and Beihai areas."</p>
<p>From this point of view, although the Japanese army's reserve forces in South China have been increasing one after another, it is still a long way to go to achieve the predetermined goal because the Chinese side is doing its best to resist. Now both sides are preparing, and a fierce battle is about to begin.</p>
<p>On the Yuehan Road</p>
<p>There has also been contact recently. The Japanese army in Yueyang is still surrounded by the Chinese army. A certain unit of the Chinese army once rushed into Yueyang City and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. Later, as the Japanese army continued to increase, the Chinese army withdrew from the city. The Chinese army on the Xiang-E Highway is now starting to attack Tongcheng to the north, and another unit is attacking Shaping between Chongyang and Tongcheng. In this way, the Japanese army's retreat to Tongcheng will be cut off.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese army's activities in the Xiangbian area, the question is whether it can maintain the existing situation with all its strength? If you want to connect the north and south lines and achieve the effect of taking care of each other, it may not be easy to implement.</p>
<p>Shanxi War</p>
<p>There was also contact this week, especially northwest of Linfen, which was the most intense. The Japanese army is now advancing westward in three routes, one route is advancing to Xiangning, one route is attacking Puxian, and one route is attacking the north of Xixian. Reports say that many Japanese planes have repeatedly flown to Daning, Xixian, and bombed the area. The Chinese army in Xixian is now the 115th Division. It has been fighting fiercely with the Japanese army in the southeast of Xixian, while the Chinese army in Puxian Xiangning is the 72nd and 69th Divisions led by General Yan Xishan, which are extremely well-equipped. This is to prevent the Japanese army from invading western Shanxi. Although this kind of contact has expanded, it is still a strategy to test the advance to the northwest, and it seems that they are still waiting for an opportunity to launch a large-scale attack.</p>
<p>But according to another telegram, the fierce fighting in the southwest of Shanxi Province is still in progress. The Japanese artillery unit on the east bank of the Yellow River in Shaanxi Province bombarded the Chinese army positions on the opposite bank of Yumen Ferry and the confluence of the Yellow River and the Fen River. The Chinese artillery unit on the west bank also retaliated fiercely. According to the Chinese authorities, a large number of Chinese troops have entered Shanxi Province for a long-term stay, waiting to deal with the incident. In view of this situation, it is by no means easy for the Japanese army to attack Shaanxi Province.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more thing that deserves our attention, that is, the departure of Mr. Wang Jingwei! Mr. Wang Jingwei, the vice president of the Chinese Kuomintang, has recently asked the Central Government for leave and went abroad for recuperation. It is said that he was injured in an assassination two years ago, and now the old wound has relapsed and he needs to go abroad for recuperation. After the news came out, Mr. Wang had already left Chongqing, and his whereabouts have been very secretive since then. But this is not to say in detail. What deserves my attention is the reason for his sudden departure and his future actions. Some people say that Mr. Wang's departure is related to peace negotiations. This point is especially the most sensational propaganda of the Japanese side and Haitong News Agency.</p>
<p>However, after Chairman Chiang's explanation at the memorial week in Chongqing the other day, this kind of propaganda has disappeared. Chairman Chiang said: "It is rumored that Mr. Wang's decision to leave Chongqing is related to peace negotiations with Japan. This kind of bizarre news is purely unfounded. The purpose of the Japanese side's counter-propaganda is to confuse our hearing and shake the international recognition of China's resistance against Japan. Mr. Wang's departure from Chongqing is purely a personal action. To this day, no one will ever want to compromise and make peace with Japan again. Moreover, Mr. Wang's behavior in the world is sincere and upright, and the people of the country have seen it. Therefore, all the rumors outside are suspected of provoking discord and are not worthy of trust."</p>
<p>However, the evolution of this matter is still developing. Chairman Jiang's talk is just to measure Mr. Wang with the heart of a gentleman and not to do this. As of the date of this manuscript, it was suddenly telegraphed that Wang Jingwei actually suggested to the Central Government to negotiate peace with Japan, which is really surprising. Due to space limitations, let's hear the next breakdown.</p>
<h3>A Pilgrimage to the Refugee Self-Sufficiency Shelter (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yixin</p>
<p>After the Shanghai War broke out last year, the charitable organizations in the two concessions in Shanghai did a lot. According to the statistics in March of this year, there were 200 shelters. Later, they gradually merged. Some of them were closed, and some of the shelters were changed into self-sufficiency shelters. What is the difference between a "self-sufficiency shelter" and a "shelter"? "Self-sufficiency" means to provide for oneself. The refugees inside are all able to produce themselves and maintain their own lives. The elderly and the young are supported by their relatives; the young and strong go out to find work, such as factories, peddlers, etc.; or work in the shelter, such as rattan work, woolen thread, lace, grass weaving, mops, sewing, etc. Those who cannot support themselves are moved to other shelters, and those who can support themselves are moved into self-sufficiency shelters. The refugees in the "shelter" are completely provided with food, clothing and shelter by the shelter. There is only consumption and no life; the "self-sufficiency shelter" only provides shelter, and they are responsible for their own food and clothing; this is the difference between the "shelter" and the "self-sufficiency shelter". The author has visited the authorities of each shelter to investigate the self-sufficiency situation. The situations of each shelter are different. Here, I have written down the situations of several self-sufficiency shelters for people who are concerned about the refugee issue.</p>
<p>(1) The First Self-Sufficiency Shelter: The location is in Qingliang Temple, Xinji Garden, Xinzao Road. All affairs are handled by the director and deputy director, and there are administrators to manage daily affairs. The refugees in the shelter were organized by 2,300 people who could support themselves in the Qingliang Shelter. Together with the service staff, there are a total of 724 people. The shelter is equipped with stoves to provide refugees with cooking. The expenses for water, electricity, and medicine are entirely provided by the Charity Association. In the future plan, five cents will be collected from each person per month to cover the expenses of water and electricity for the entire shelter. In terms of education in the shelter, adult education has not yet been held; in terms of children, there are currently five primary classes and one intermediate class; the total number of people is 285.</p>
<p>(2) The Second Self-Sufficiency Shelter: The address is Hetai Warehouse, North Fujian Road, with 553 refugees. The shelter has a director and a deputy director, and is divided into three sections: general affairs, personnel, and education. The general affairs section is divided into: 1. Document, 2. Accounting, 3. Food supply, 4. Health, 5. General affairs, 5 groups; The personnel section is divided into: 1. Production, 2. Public security, 3. Autonomy, 4. Registration, 4 groups; The education section is divided into: 1. Teaching, 2. Research, 3. Recreation, 3 groups. The shelter is a reorganization of Hetai Shelter. Most of the refugees in the shelter can support themselves. The shelter sells rice every day, at 100 Wen per catty. The food for the children studying in the shelter and the staff is provided by the shelter. The expenses for water, electricity, and medicine are borne by the Charity Association. There are currently three children's classes, including first grade, second grade, and third grade, with a total of 121 people. The educated children are allocated a separate area, and there is morning exercise for half an hour every morning. A small tea room is also opened in the shelter, specifically for adults to rest after work. At the same time, teachers often give lectures on common sense and current affairs, which is also a method of education, so that adults can receive ordinary knowledge outside of work and do not feel dull and spiritually bored.</p>

<h3>A Record of Attending the National Exhibition of Art by the Deaf and Mute - Now Closed, to be Exhibited Elsewhere</h3>
<p>— Jue Zhi</p>
<p>The National Art Exhibition of the Deaf and Mute, sponsored by the China Association for the Deaf and Mute, opened at the Private Shangzhong School in Jing'an Temple on New Year's Day. From morning till night, there were many visitors. The exhibits were divided into three categories: first, works donated by famous calligraphers and painters; second, works from schools; and third, works by members and fellow sufferers. In total, there were approximately eight hundred items. My impressions are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The first room displayed works donated by famous calligraphers and painters, such as Li Jianzhi's running script musical instrument slip, Xie Gongzhan's flowers, Jiang Danshu's Clouds over Huangshan, Xie Xian'ou and Ding Xianghua's Amitabha, Wang Yachen's Fish Enjoying Themselves, Cheng Xiaoqing's plum blossoms, Zhang Daqi's Orioles in the Willow Shade, Chen Qiucao's landscapes, and Yu Jianhua's Listening to the Springs, all demonstrating skillful execution and not merely perfunctory works. Huang Jingwan contributed rubbings of the Han Xixia Song Stele, and He Gusheng donated Gao Ziqing's calligraphic copy of Zhu Zi's Family Precepts for fundraising.</p>
<p>(2) The second room displayed works from schools. Aside from simple items sent for display by the schools of Beiping, Yantai, and Liaoning, the Shanghai schools for the deaf and mute showed good results. One was from the Fuya School, including various charts, jade and stone seals, various decorative paintings, female students' embroidery, various lifestyle photographs taken by the students' photography club, and calligraphy, all being diligent works. It is proper to state that the school's vice-principal, Zai Jingyuan, has developed and invented a type of teaching manual chart based on more than ten years of teaching and research, combining the old-style Bell visible speech alphabet with the modern phonetic symbol pronunciation manual chart. He added scientific methods to simplify the complicated manual gestures. (The old manual gestures required five movements for one character; now only one or two hand gestures are needed for accurate pronunciation). Teaching by following the chart has been shown to be very effective. It has benefitted many deaf and mute people. The second was from the school for the deaf and mute attached to the China Association for the Deaf and Mute, including students' Chinese and Western paintings, metal and stone crafts, and embroidery. The results were excellent. This room displayed photographic portraits of Helen Keller, an American blind and deaf woman, communicating with others through touch. Seeing this, one understands the omnipotence of education, which is sufficient to promote the external world's belief in deaf and mute education and the fellow sufferers' interest in research. In this room were landscape scrolls by the deaf and mute Zhao Guangshun and Han Zhizhong, which were quite elaborate and detailed.</p>
<p>(3) The third room displayed works by members and fellow sufferers, such as Shi Yafu and Shen Shigao's landscapes, Gu Wuming and Wu Yiming's female figures, Huang Lizhuang, Zhang Jingyu, and Shi Zhihe's flowers, Zhu Qizhan and Wang Yachen's collaborative chickens and chrysanthemums, Wu Mo's calligraphy and paintings, Liu Kuizhong's flowers and birds, and He Jian and Ling Ziyun's calligraphy, all showing hard work and thus being extraordinary.</p>
<p>(4) The fourth room also displayed many works by members and fellow sufferers, including Wu Zhuyin's oil paintings, Wang Lingchuan's pastels, Zhang Zhongying's emerging pastels, as well as lacquer paintings, watercolors, patterns, advertisements, and other paintings. It is proper to state that member Cao Chinan exquisitely carved various match trademarks out of boxwood, his skills being divine. Feng Xun's commercial art designs and advertisements had sophisticated designs and beautiful color schemes. Dong Jinluo's dyed patterns took great care. Qian Zhigang's thirty cartoons, such as "The Night of the Tianjin Incident" and "People Fighting for a Dog," as well as various pictures depicting poetic intent, were deeply meaningful and worthy of contemplation.</p>
<p>It is heard that the association has closed on the 2nd and plans to select another location to continue the exhibition for several days. All the donated works of famous calligraphers and painters, with values ​​ranging from over twenty yuan to a dozen yuan, and ten yuan to eight yuan each, will be sold by lottery, with each item uniformly priced at five yuan.</p>

Thirty years ago, it was the highest institution of learning in the Southeast. During the Xinhai Revolution, it was completely destroyed. Supervisor Li Meian maintained it painstakingly but unsuccessfully. Therefore, he became angry and withdrew from the world, donning a yellow crown. The thousands of students from the East and West also scattered. This resolved to avoid the isolated island where soldiers would meet after the disaster. Zang Fogen and Li Zhongqian initiated a dinner gathering, publicly commemorating Master Mei, and discussed searching for and engraving Master Mei's posthumous works and alumni directory. It was held once last winter at Xiaoyoutian Restaurant, with fifty or sixty people attending. The day before yesterday, it was held again at Yijiachun. Teachers Zai Bingbo, Liu Mou, Xiao Wuquan, Yu Yudong, and Yao Meng also arrived one after another. It is heard that it will continue during the Lunar New Year. If there are old classmates who have not participated, they can write to Mr. Zang at No. 3 Ruby Lane, Hedde Road to register for communication purposes.</p>

<p>Jewish Victory Over Russia</p>
<p>The match between the Jewish and Russian teams took place at 10:30 yesterday morning at Yishi Mao, with only about 400 spectators, mostly Jewish and Russian expatriates. Russia had outstanding players such as Roberts Stoff, Mike Dunn, Bolini, and Nicholas Leff, and their forwards were quite sharp. Although the Jewish team had no particularly outstanding individuals, the players were young and strong. The competition between the two sides was fierce, and the situation was extremely tense. Jewish player S. Greenberg dribbled deep and shot at the 18-yard mark, scoring the first goal. In the 28th minute, Bolinki lightly tried his foot, also scoring a goal. The Jewish team took a 2-0 lead. The Russian team actively counterattacked, and Capustin advanced from the left, pulling back a goal. In the first half, the Russian team trailed 1-2. As the second half began, the two sides remained evenly matched. In the 15th minute, Jewish defender Greenberg committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. Roberts Stoff executed the kick, but the ball was saved by Sneizhong, who dove to the ground. The Jewish team survived a difficult situation and advanced with all its strength. Ten minutes before the end of the game, Jewish player Lee Foo passed to the edge of the goal, and S. Greenberg shot the ball into the net. In the last minute, Lee Foo kicked a corner, and the ball came at the goal. Seferlek panicked while saving the ball and accidentally hit it into the goal, giving away a point. The whistle blew, and the Jewish team defeated Russia 4-1.</p>

<p>Portuguese Victory Over Germany</p>
<p>The match between the Portuguese and German teams took place at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. The Portuguese team was the champion team of 1936-37 and also reached the finals in the previous tournament. Their strength was exceptionally strong. The German team's Newburg Pike was a famous French player, but the rest were mediocre, so the game was one-sided. After the start of the game, Portuguese center forward Rocha Lio scored two consecutive goals, and Fafan Xiao then scored, taking a 3-0 lead. At this time, the German team scored their first goal through center forward Newburg, but shortly after, Fafan Xiao scored another goal. Thus, the result of the first half was 4-2. After changing sides, the Portuguese team scored two more goals. In conclusion, the Portuguese team eliminated Germany 6-2.</p>

<h3>Difficult to Open the Gate of Charity</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>After a great philanthropist did a few things for public welfare, people asking for relief came one after another, some asking for money, some asking for food and clothing. Everyone hoped that the great philanthropist would "open his golden hand" and give them satisfactory gifts. As a result, the great philanthropist was unable to manage, so he had to close the gate and become a wealthy man who believed that "a good person is rich," which is indeed the case.</p>
<p>The gate of charity is indeed difficult to open. Once opened, it may not be easy to close. After all, there are many poor people in China, and there are few great philanthropists, so it is impossible to satisfy every "ragged" person. Even in European countries, it is no different. When Hitler of Germany was gearing up and preparing to seize the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, Mr. Zhang of England had a great sense of compassion and did not hesitate to humble himself and fly to Germany to do a great good deed, so that countless soldiers would not have to sacrifice themselves in the midst of fierce artillery fire. This kind of merit is truly unforgettable.</p>
<p>Now the territorial dispute between France and Italy is also at a difficult and inseparable juncture. The French authorities have clearly stated that they do not want Britain to mediate, fearing that Mr. Zhang will grind other people's heads into sauce again and do another charitable work. However, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini knows that Mr. Zhang is a man of great magnanimity and compassion, and is unwilling to let go easily. He is still trying his best to urge Mr. Zhang to convey Italy's various demands to France, because Mr. Zhang has already helped Germany to succeed in the past and will certainly not refuse to help Italy in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang has already become a great philanthropist, and I suppose he is unwilling to become a second great philanthropist, but since he has become the first great philanthropist, he cannot help but become the second great philanthropist. If he does not become the second great philanthropist, then the merits of the first great philanthropist will also be in vain. Mr. Mo has seen this point and will definitely say, "Big brother! We must ask you to come out and help us. Doing good deeds will bring good rewards." This is what it means to say that the gate of charity is difficult to open.</p>
<h3>A Poor Child Tries on New Clothes</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>——A Quick Sketch of the Children's Welfare Association Distributing Winter Clothing for the New Year——</p>
<p>In this city of Shanghai, there have been many children these past few days, going to movie theaters and opera houses with their parents, returning with bundles of toys and candies. But on the other hand, there are countless homeless street children, shivering in the cold wind wearing thin and tattered clothes. The Shanghai office of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, dedicated to children's welfare, is distributing winter clothing during this New Year to provide these homeless street children with cotton-padded clothes to ward off the cold. They are distributing a total of six thousand sets in stages according to the district, starting on New Year's Day for four days. The first day was at the Shaoxing Native Association on Avenue Edward VII, the second day was at Guohua Middle School on Gordon Road, the third day was at the Zhabei Poor Children's Education and Care Center in Wangjiazhai, and the fourth day was at the Cixie Education and Care Center on Route Lafayette.</p>
<p>Because Guohua Middle School is very close to my residence, I took some time on the morning of the 2nd to see the distribution of winter clothing. The stipulated time was from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. When I arrived at Guohua Middle School, it was not yet ten o'clock, but a large crowd of miserable children had already gathered at the entrance, boys and girls, ranging from six or seven to thirteen or fourteen years old. Each one was disheveled and dirty, wearing tattered clothes that no longer provided warmth. The younger ones, from a few months to two or three years old, were brought by adults. Cold clothing vouchers had been distributed in advance, so everyone held a green voucher in their hands. Then the staff told them to swarm into the iron gate, but those without cold clothing vouchers, or only adults without children, were not allowed to enter.</p>
<p>The corridor in front of the classrooms of Guohua Middle School was piled high with stacks of winter clothing, almost touching the roof. The playground was cordoned off with desks and ropes to create walkways for entering and exiting. The children were arranged in an orderly line, first come, first served, no pushing. Each male and female staff member wore a cloth number on their sleeve, numbering twenty or thirty people, so the order was maintained quite well. Those who arrived first went in, and more and more continued to arrive. The outer wall of Guohua Middle School was not high, so by standing on tiptoe, one could see the distribution of winter clothing from the outside. Therefore, the low wall along Gordon Road was also filled with people, but the heartless police officers constantly came to disperse them.</p>
<p>At a quarter past ten, the distribution began. Under the guidance of the staff, the miserable children walked onto the platform. After checking the vouchers, each person was given a set of cotton-padded clothes. There were four sizes, distributed according to the size of the children. The process was very fast; in less than an hour, almost several hundred sets of winter clothing had been distributed. Then the adults and children who received the clothes lined up again and exited Guohua Middle School in an orderly fashion. Each person carried a set of new winter clothing, with black cloth on the outside and white cloth on the inside, and the cotton was quite thick. Everyone was happy and jumping for joy. They walked out of Guohua Middle School, and some couldn't wait to put it on and try it out, to see if the size fit. Several adults waiting outside were very happy to see their children receive new clothes. Perhaps these children had never worn such new clothes in their entire lives! We must thank the efforts of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, but we hope that all sectors can continue to contribute funds to allow these little lives to get through this severe winter.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>The Pearl Shirt</h3>
<p>— Ruhua</p>
<p>Produced by Huaxin Film Company, Showing at Xin Guang Theater</p>
<p>Warner Oland's "Charlie Chan Detective Cases" had been listed in Twentieth Century's production plan as a "must-produce" item, with several films being made every year. Unfortunately, this "cash cow" passed away last year due to heart disease. After Warner Oland's death, the "Charlie Chan Detective Cases" naturally could not continue to be produced, but very quickly, Twentieth Century created a "Great Detective Moto" and still used the Chinese star Lu Xiqi, who played Charlie Chan's son, as an assistant. This "Great Detective Moto" is played by Peter Lorre, who starred in the horror film "M," and his "Moto" naturally created a new style. However, recent news has spread that Twentieth Century has found a new person whose appearance is quite similar to Warner Oland. It seems that Twentieth Century has not given up on its plan to produce "Charlie Chan Detective Cases."</p>
<p>Huaxin Company's production of "The Pearl Shirt" is probably also motivated by Xu Xinyuan's close resemblance to Warner Oland. Indeed, Xu Xinyuan's facial contours, figure, and demeanor, as seen on the screen, can be said to be exactly the same as Warner Oland.</p>
<p>The screenwriter and director of "The Pearl Shirt" is Xu Xinfu, who previously wrote and directed detective films such as "Emerald Horse" and "Lively Dragon and Tiger." Based on his past experience, this Chinese Great Detective Charlie Chan's first amazing detective case upon returning to China, "The Pearl Shirt," shows several significant improvements. First, he infused scientific knowledge into this detective case. For example, Charlie Chan deliberately allowed the robbers to steal a batch of jewelry worth 20,000 yuan in a tea room, but installed a generator in the jewelry box. When the generator generated electricity, the direction of the robbers' den could be measured in a specially made radio box. After Charlie Chan was arrested, he used a miniature generator to call for help, etc., so that the general audience unintentionally received a scientific education while being entertained, which truly fulfilled the principle that film is an educational tool. However, due to the sudden stoppage of current in a radio repair tool and the sudden interruption of the sound of the radio, the true culprit was discovered. We have considerable doubts about this "precious" "lightning rod."</p>
<p>Similarly, the directorial techniques are also more advanced. For example, at the beginning, when the ancient tomb map of the Zhao mansion was stolen, he first wrote about Zhao Xiaofan's nephew returning late at night, acting furtively, and the car driver flirting with the maidservant's secretive actions, and then wrote about the safe being stolen. This "smoke screen" is arranged very cleverly. When Charlie Chan returned to China to take over the case, the pearl shirt was stolen a day earlier, followed by several clues that were closely related to the pearl shirt, such as Xu Desheng's murder and Honest's murder, which obscured the past amidst the continuous occurrence of murder cases. This is much better than past works, where you knew who the murderer was from the very beginning.</p>
<p>However, there are also flaws here. For example, after the ancient tomb was stolen, this well-organized gang of thieves would never immediately sell the jade artifacts to antique dealers. Although when Old Dong was killed, Little Yang added a sentence, "Taught you to go to foreign merchants, why sell to Jumaozhai?" (general idea). However, this is still not enough. A theft organization like this would not let others handle the disposal of the stolen goods. Also, Hu Lie is the only capable person in the gang who can see the "boss," and he should be a very alert person, but he confusedly gave the stolen jade bracelet to Miss Bai. These two points, I think, are the biggest loopholes.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, Xu Xinyuan's Charlie Chan does not need to completely imitate Warner Oland's slow movements (which are foreign assumptions about Chinese movements). He might as well be more alert and agile.</p>
<h3>Our Life</h3>
<p>— Xu You</p>
<p>We originally lived an inhuman life. Since the "August 13th" Incident, our lives have become more and more panicked, and more and more difficult. Before "August 13th," we only had to work seven or eight hours a day and could earn forty or fifty cents. Now, we work ten or more hours a day, but only earn twenty-something cents.</p>
<p>Because our income is so meager, our life is truly beyond my ability to describe. It's really terribly bad! Now, let me briefly report our daily life to the readers!</p>
<p>Accommodation</p>
<p>We live mostly in three-tiered and two-tiered shacks. The air is extremely foul. At least a dozen people sleep in one room. Beds are arranged horizontally and vertically. We don't even have proper beds; we just spread something on the floor. If it's a hot summer, mosquitoes and bedbugs will use us as their food. So, we suffer from more diseases than ordinary people.</p>
<p>Food and Drink</p>
<p>Usually, we have porridge twice a day, morning and evening. At noon, we eat a bowl of dry rice. Some are even more frugal and only eat two meals, one around 10 AM and another around 5 PM. Side dishes are all tofu, bean sprouts, pickled vegetables, dried radish, etc. We have never tasted fish or meat. When we work the night shift, the factory gives us each six copper coins to buy a pancake to eat in the middle of the night. Although we bite into two pancakes during this entire twelve-hour night shift, how can they satisfy the hunger in our stomachs!</p>
<p>Clothing</p>
<p>Since we can barely sustain our lives, of course, we wouldn't dream of having any beautiful clothes. We don't even have basic, crude clothes. When winter comes, our clothing is especially difficult. However, those poor young sisters-in-law, seeing other people's socks and handkerchiefs, would rather go hungry and save a few copper coins to buy those handkerchiefs and socks. This is a world of difference from those ladies and young concubines who wear socks costing ten or more yuan a pair.</p>
<p>Work</p>
<p>We get up from our hard boards at four o'clock in the morning, dragging our heavy steps towards the man-eating factory, to continue doing that mechanical work. We work from 5 AM to 7 PM, more than fourteen hours a day. During work, if we talk or play for a while, the foreman's whip will fall on our heads. It can be said that we live a disguised prison life every day!</p>
<p>The above is just a general description of our daily life. Ah! We are now simply like birds trapped in a cage! All freedom and happiness have been deprived from us by life! Depression and resentment are constantly burning in my heart. However, I know that these things only happen in an unreasonable social system. Therefore, we are not only not pessimistic, but we constantly fight against evil forces! Although we have to endure a little now due to living problems, we will never succumb to evil forces.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The One-Armed Old Man Organizes a Free Village, the Twin Daughters Respectfully Visit the Martyrs' Tomb</p>
<p>This country schoolteacher's surname was Zhu, and his given name was Gengen. Country people don't have grand names or style names; Gengen is just Gengen, the name and style are the same. However, acquaintances in the countryside all call him Lao Yuan. Zhu Lao Yuan was well-known in that town because he was considered a sensible and decisive person in the town. If there were any problems that the whole village couldn't solve, they would all ask Zhu Lao Yuan. Any difficult matter was often handled clearly by Zhu Lao Yuan's ideas. This is also why the whole village respected him so much. That's why he could do it. In the years of the Republic of China, 23 and 24, there were several places in China that trained recruits. This news spread to the village. Other villages didn't understand the meaning of training recruits, but when it reached Zhu Lao Yuan's village, many strong young men became excited. This was not without Zhu Lao Yuan's credit, because he often told a group of people in ordinary days. Now our Chinese future is so dangerous: how terrible foreigners are; how painful it is to lose our country. He also told them that China has always been known as a weak country. The reason why it is called a weak country is that the people do not have a strong will and do not have a trained body. Therefore, they cannot resist strong enemies. This remark of his made the village youths want to try it. Originally, those village youths were mostly his students, and the students naturally listened to what the teacher said. Those rural youths usually played with guns and sticks, lifted thousand-pound stones, and practiced Shaolin boxing. They were extremely happy. When recruit training came to the village, the youths were very enthusiastic and everyone scrambled to sign up. Country people originally got up early, but now, when it wasn't even dawn, they got up for morning exercises. Not only many youths in the village, but Zhu Lao Yuan himself also acted as a guide in it. At that time, an army sent a military officer to teach them. This officer had a good knowledge of military affairs. In addition to teaching them how to practice, there were often sermons. Dao's sermon was not very serious, but was a kind of persuasive and encouraging, so that the rural children were very happy to hear. That officer knew that Zhu Lao Yuan was the model for the whole village, so he promoted him to the captain, and of course Zhu Lao Yuan became even more enthusiastic. At this time, the village seemed to be armed. Although the uniform was only worth two yuan and five jiao, the rural youths wore them, went home after morning exercises, walked on the banks of the field, straightened their bodies, and straightened their waists, how majestic!

<h3>The Prelude to 1939: A Post-War Greeting from Cantonese Opera Performers; The Renewal Stage Meeting on the Seventh Day of This Month</h3>
<p>— Shugang</p>
<p>The prelude to 1939 has already been opened. The first major event in the theatrical world, I think in these short few days, is the crucial meeting of Dongxi's stars in Shanghai after the war to make a first decision on the appearance of Cantonese people in Shanghai. The arrival of Cantonese opera in Shanghai was very ordinary before the war, but it was quite difficult after the war. If there are no special performances, they will not come easily. In the autumn of last year, Hong Kong Cantonese opera artists once resolved to not go to other places temporarily, because they absolutely refused to cooperate with others. I dare say that this decision is worth cherishing, not like ordinary dramas.</p>
<p>In addition to Wenwusheng (leading male role in Cantonese opera) Gui Mingyang, there is also a comet in Cantonese opera, Luo Jiaquan, who is the leader of the four great clowns. In the minds of Cantonese people, there may be those who do not know Xue Juexian, but there is no one who does not know Luo Jiaquan. The decision is that Xiaowusheng (young male martial role) Liang Yintang and Xin Zhu are both emerging roles with artistry. On the Kun (female) side, of course everyone knows Tan Yulan and Tang Xueqian, but these figures are not easily performed anymore, and the giant wheels of the times are constantly moving forward; Wen Huamei, Zi Lan Nu, and Hua Lisi, who have inherited them, are all beautiful Kun roles with superb artistry. I think people of the new era should of course have a good impression of the roles of the new era.</p>
<p>This group of Cantonese opera performers, with full of hot expectations, is coming to Shanghai soon. Yesterday, Xiang Sheng Company, which is in charge of Cantonese opera affairs, has received a telegram. This afternoon at 2 o'clock, taking the sea of ​​Changxing Company, they are riding the waves, and the Cantonese compatriots in Shanghai have prepared a grand welcome. The date of their debut on the stage is probably in the evening of the seventh of this month.</p>
<p>The entire Shanghai people are immersed in an atmosphere of enjoyment. Shouldn't I be spoiling the fun by reporting this piece of news today? (Lai Chen)</p>
<h3>New Year's and Entertainment (Continued to the End)</h3>
<p>— Xitong</p>
<p>The New Year's and Yuan Ridge amusements of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties can be found in volumes 1, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 13 of "Yongxi Yuefu," such as "Lantern Festival," "Lantern Poetry," "Lantern Night," and "Yunnight." There are about 20 suites in total. Due to space limitations, I cannot list them in detail. In short, those are good materials for studying acrobatics (i.e., various miscellaneous performances), which can be read together with Zhang Heng's "Western Capital Rhapsody" and Li Yun's "Pingleguan Rhapsody." Let me give a few examples: Jia Zhongming's Lantern Poetry says: "Qiao Sanjiao is happy to move music, and Drunken Eight Immortals quickly stumble high on stilts." Cao Mengxiu's Lantern Night says: "See, see, see the puppet children come together, each holding treasures in their hands, out, out, out, circling around several times... Yes, yes, yes, the Yuanben (early form of Chinese drama) does a section on Qiao Teaching, He, he, he, dance together to the music of the village fields." An anonymous person's Yuan Night says: "The peddler comes to sell on credit, and the children play with bamboo horses." An anonymous person's Lantern Poetry says: "The funny Yuanben is really pretty, and Bao Lao dances on one side." As shown above, it can be seen that the fifteenth day of the first month of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties was not much different from the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>The New Year's Day of the Qing Dynasty can be exemplified by the archives of the Shengping Department. Zhou Mingtai's "Random Copy of Examples from the Shengping Department Archives" puts all the performances on New Year's Day together. The Yi cavity often performed in the Qing Palace included Jingde Fishing, etc. (only in the third year of Daoguang; it was gone in the fourth year). The Yue Ling Chengying Opera included "Receiving Many Blessings," "Myriad Blessings United," "Opening a Feast to Celebrate," and "Humorous Festival Greetings," which were mostly boring plays that were auspicious (published by the Ancient Palace Museum). Kunqu Opera included Sweeping Flowers, Three Drunkennesses, Qiao Vinegar, Shanmen, and Visiting Su, which are recorded in the Enshang Diary Archives from the third year of Daoguang to the third year of Tongzhi. However, in the Enshang Diary Archives of the fifth year of Tongzhi, Ping Opera Green Stone Mountain, Jinshui Bridge, Zhao Family Building, Visiting Relatives, and Blocking Liang were added, which shows the transition from Yi cavity through Kun cavity to Luan Tan.</p>
<p>The significance of modern entertainment, for example, this year, may lie in rejoicing in the unified national spirit of the all-out war of resistance and Chairman Chiang's determination to resist to the end. In that case, Jin Suqin's "Liang Hongyu," Chen Yunshang's "Mulan Joins the Army," Zhou Xinfang and Wang Xichun's "Fragrant Concubine's Hatred," the Xianni Society's "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," Zai Yunfeng's "Golden Spear Story," Xu Jixiang, Jiang Yifei, Zhang Hongsheng, and Xia Zhifei's "Biography of Heroes," Li Hanchen's "Yue Biography"...and so on, should be more meaningful, right?</p>
<p>Although it is said to be New Year's entertainment, it seems to have told a concrete and miniature history of drama. This is a little intention of my writing.</p>
<h3>Embellishing the Silent New Year: A Record of the Silk and Cloth Society's Celebration</h3>
<p>— Shu Wu</p>
<p>The Silk and Cloth Society is an abbreviation for the Silk and Cotton Cloth Industry Knowledge-Seeking Mutual Aid Society. It was established last autumn by colleagues in the silk and cotton cloth industry, with the aim of "using spare time to connect feelings, study real skills, and exchange various knowledge." The society was originally located in the Xindaxiang Building. Because of the development of the society and the expansion of its members, the original location was not enough, so it recently moved to the second floor of 260 Tianjin Road. When the New Year came in joyous cheers, the Silk and Cloth Society was also full of new vitality.</p>
<p>The Silk and Cloth Society was established to seek the welfare of all colleagues in the industry, so their facilities were also made according to this goal. In addition to establishing a library, setting up a cram school, and publishing the Silk and Cloth Monthly, they also hold various noble entertainments to enable colleagues to change their past corrupt lives in their spare time. The entertainment that the Silk and Cloth Society has already organized includes table tennis, harmonica, chess, singing, silk and bamboo instruments, Ping opera, and drama, etc. This joint celebration is also a manifestation of the results of their usual practice.</p>
<p>I stepped into the Silk and Cloth Society, and the clock had just struck seven. The guests were crammed into all the seats. To the sound of the harmonium and erhu accompaniment, the curtain gradually opened. First was the chairman's report, followed by the "Recruitment Team Formation." In advance, the executive committee elected more than 20 team leaders from among the members. Using a competition method, each person was asked to do their best to introduce new members, hoping to expand the original two hundred or so members to more than double that number. After introducing each team leader individually, it was the first drama of the Liaison Theater Company - "A Glass of Milk." The meaning of the whole play is to describe a hypocritical so-called "philanthropist" who only knows how to fish for fame. The real charity is placed in front of him, but he doesn't do it. A comedy full of laughter directly exposes the true face of a part of hypocrites! After that, there was singing, with male and female parts singing together, singing "New Life Movement," "Manjianghong," "On the Jialing River," and "Brightness." Finally, due to the request of the guests, they added another "Boatman's Song in Ambush." Whether in terms of melody or coordination, they have already reached the point of purity. The free singing of the members was not so good. But their enthusiasm is commendable!</p>
<p>The second Liaison Society's song was "Christmas Flower" by a pair of young men and women. Because the lyrics were funny, everyone laughed, and even the singers laughed. Mu suddenly closed, and only after the unanimous request of the guests did it continue to sing, earning loud applause and unstoppable laughter!</p>
<p>Before the final drama "Dawn" opened, there was another report from the chairman, preparing for a bigger celebration during the lunar new year. We are eagerly awaiting "Dawn" is also a one-act play, which seems to be the most surprising program of the celebration. In terms of performance, the actors have done their best, and everyone is very good. However, the meaning of the play is not clear enough, and it is not as spicy and flavorful as "A Glass of Milk." After the whole play is over, the audience still cannot grasp its main idea. Moreover, the hints behind the scenes were so loud that even the audience heard them, which should be absolutely avoided! Generally speaking, it was a rare achievement to have such a result after only hurried preparations. I think there will be better performances at the second celebration of the Lunar New Year, so let's look forward to it!</p>
<p>Announcement</p>
<p>The increase of the Weiqi (Go) Academy in the entertainment world has been described in a small notice yesterday, and I would like to clarify something further: The art of Weiqi is infinitely changing, and there is no end to perfection. Even a national player dare not be proud of his art. This academy is edited by Mr. Bao Zibo, and only seeks to have a dedicated person in charge. It is not to say that Mr. Bao's art is unsurpassed. And Mr. Bao certainly has no such intention. Moreover, this academy is purely for entertainment purposes and cannot be compared with competing for fame. There must be many masters among the readers of this newspaper, but I am sorry that I cannot visit and ask for advice one by one. I hope you will not hesitate to contribute your pearls and jade and share your experiences to benefit your fellow enthusiasts and increase the glory of this academy. You are welcome to do so.

<h3>Secret Stories of the Old Capital's Imperial Palace and Opera World (6)(4)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Yu Shuyan Visited More Than Ten Famous Teachers</p>
<p>Qian Jinfu sang martial roles. Because he wore padded clothing inside, he raised his shoulders very high. As for Li Keyong in "Zhu Lian Zhai," since he had returned to playing the student role, he could only follow the rules for playing older male roles, raising his shoulders halfway. Halfway meant raising both shoulders slightly, making them form an oval shape, a very simple posture. Because Shuyan was assisted by Jinfu, he always raised his shoulders too high. Later, although someone told him to change it, it was very difficult to change a deeply ingrained habit. The body movements in "Wen Qiao" and "Tian Lei Bao" indeed relied heavily on Wang Shuanzi. The mannerisms in the study of "Nao Fu" were taught by Jinfu. For this complete version of "Qiong Lin Yan," having Qian and Wang as supporting actors would undoubtedly make Shushi's performance outstanding. Now that those veteran actors are all dead, it's no wonder Shuyan no longer performs it. In addition, Cheng Jixian and Bao Jixiang also had a relationship with Shuyan that was half teacher and half friend. Because he admired people like Qiu Guixian who could both sing and play instruments, he also learned the huqin diligently from veteran Yan Heng and others. Previously, his qin player, Li Peixiang, was a renowned player he trained. His versatility and the number of famous teachers he sought out are probably unmatched by anyone else in the profession today.</p>
<p>The Secret to Eavesdropping on Yu Shuyan Warming Up His Voice</p>
<p>Shuyan, who used to be called Little Yu, is now in his fifties and has become the leading figure in the world of older male roles, with the demeanor of the late King Tan. The ancient Chinese philosophers spoke of working at sunrise and resting at sunset, but Shuyan did the opposite. He "sleeps at dawn" every day and only slowly gets up when the electric lights come on. After having a late dinner (which would be considered an early breakfast according to American time) and smoking enough, it's almost twelve o'clock. When everyone else is asleep, you can see a thin qin player named Zhu Jia carrying a huqin, listlessly entering Yu's residence in Chunshu Second Alley. At this time, Shuyan is in high spirits, full of energy. Regular friends like Zhang Boju, Li Shike, and Le Yuanke have all opened their talk boxes (not listening to records, but these people talking endlessly), telling jokes, discussing opera, or making fun of amateur performers or other veteran male actors. Shuyan is a very sharp conversationalist, sometimes using witty remarks to tease people, which is truly very humorous.</p>

<p>Because Japanese "first-class writer" Sato Haruo, after visiting Shanghai, said that Zhabei looked like a painting by Goya, I began to think about some current issues in painting.</p>
<p>In reality, if there were a writer like Goya today, it would be very necessary. Let's not even mention his famous works like "The Disasters of War," but just his exhaustive attitude alone. If he were alive today, his works would definitely have a huge impact. But that impact, needless to say, is not the unique taste that Sato Haruo seeks.</p>
<p>We can frankly say that there has never been a writer like this in China. Chinese genre paintings are often just simple historical paintings, and even the highest achievements can only barely be compared to the French Rococo painter Watteau. But this is only a bare comparison. However, at the end of the Qing dynasty, a great painter appeared, and that was Wu Jiayou, known as Youru.</p>
<p>This painter's name has long been forgotten. Recently, someone talked about "Shanghai Anecdotes," and he was mentioned incidentally. This is appropriate. Wu Youru's contributions, generally speaking, are twofold: first, he created genuine genre paintings; second, he created large-scale serial illustrations. Both of these were unprecedented in Chinese painting history. He not only closely linked painting with current events but also used paintings as weapons against foreign aggression. I don't have "Dianshizhai Pictorial" and "Feiyingge Pictorial" at hand, but I remember that his works, in addition to depictions of the Sino-French War, which was a major event at the time, also included protests against the concession courts. Of course, he never directly opposed the Qing government, and sometimes even praised it. Moreover, his realistic techniques were sometimes naive. However, all of these should be attributed to his environment and his era.</p>
<p>In recent studies of Chinese painting (such as Mr. Yu Jianhua's "A History of Chinese Painting"), there is almost no mention of Wu Youru's name. However, everyone prefers to remember Qian Huian, a painter who was Wu Youru's contemporary, also lived in Shanghai, and was also famous for painting figures. The reason is that Qian is refined, and Wu is common. Naturally, according to the theory of Chinese painting, Qian is qualified. But what did Qian paint? Just some ladies and gentlemen who had absolutely nothing to do with his surroundings (which is fundamentally different from Wu's historical paintings). Refinement is naturally good, but I think the most thorough refinement is the landscapes of Da Mi; using the brush to arbitrarily dot them is completely free of "craftsmanship," but its use is inexplicable.</p>
<p>I am not saying that current painters must learn from Wu Youru; I am just saying that a writer like Wu Youru is still needed today. His attitude, his plan, his subject matter, current writers all need to pay attention to. If there were a writer today who could run a pictorial like Wu Youru, I think it would still be useful. Naturally, true news now has photography, but like Wu Youru, extracting the essence of current events, painting the real characters of pursuit and satire, and even adding a popular explanation at the end of the painting like Wu Youru, would still be extremely meaningful. As for the technique being more advanced, being more fused with new techniques, that goes without saying.</p>
<p>There are still art schools in Shanghai, but I have no idea what the curriculum is like. However, judging from the usual "artistic style," it is naturally impossible to go to the suburbs to sketch from life now, but I guess they are still lighting fires in the painting studio, drawing models of Liang Kai, and copying Raphael's Madonna paintings. Naturally, no one can say that basic courses should not be learned. However, at present, since there is time to use Western masterpieces to temper art, it would be much more useful to copy works like Goya than to copy Raphael. Also, I think it's not wrong to learn from works by Daumier, Toulouse-Lautrec, and others. These are just two painters that I casually thought of. That kind of art is naturally not enough for current applications, but if that method were developed, it could at least expose the corruption in a certain part of this island, at least vividly outline the original form of the traitors. However, these two painters are also considered painters with "craftsmanship" in the West, and their names are often missing from art history.</p>
<h3>Night March</h3>
<p>— Donghao</p>
<p>Night, boundless darkness.</p>
<p>No moon, no stars, only the cold light of bayonets shimmering in the darkness. Brothers gathered from all directions formed a steel-like team, passing through jungles, through desolate villages, and advancing toward the vast wilderness.</p>
<p>The surroundings were deathly silent; but in the heart of every warrior, it was as if ten thousand horses were galloping. Rapid footsteps, trampling on the muddy road scattered with gravel, made a "rustling" sound, as if encouraging the courage of thousands of warriors.</p>
<p>Climbing around the foot of a mountain, there was a dark and lush clump of reeds. The path was too narrow, and the reed leaves on both sides kissed the faces of the warriors one by one. A cold wind swept through, making a rustling sound, and the thick clouds in the sky also rushed forward rapidly. Small voices often came from within the team—everyone was discussing the extraordinary encounter that was about to come.</p>
<p>A civilian porter carrying bullets, panting and sweating profusely, was told softly by the captain:</p>
<p>"You're tired, take a break!"</p>
<p>"No, it doesn't matter. I can go back after I deliver the bullets to the generals across the railway."</p>
<p>Although it was just a short conversation, it fully demonstrated the spirit of cooperation between the military and the people.</p>
<p>The time had passed midnight, and the main railway was not far away. Because the captain had issued an order: "When crossing the railway, walk on the sacks laid on the railway. Maybe the enemy will electrify the railway."</p>
<p>After groping in the dark for a while, the front suddenly stopped. The team stirred. Everyone's heart beat suddenly intensified; the rifles on their shoulders were also taken down in preparation for firing.</p>
<p>"Report to the captain: no enemies found ahead!" A rapid and sharp voice broke the silent air. Suddenly, the "rustling" footsteps started again, and the tense mood relaxed. Many people were coughing, talking softly, and laughing. The captain issued another order: "No noise, walk lightly, prepare to cross the railway!"</p>
<p>Tension, excitement, curiosity… all kinds of inexplicable emotions occupied the hearts of everyone. Hot blood was boiling, making people forget the night cold that was attacking from all sides. Hands, pressed on the triggers, ready to deal with the sparks fired by the enemy.</p>
<p>Here! Two beams of white light lying on the ground were already visible. The officers stood by the road, waiting for the passage of the team. Everyone, like discovering a treasure, walked across this railway line, which the enemy regarded as their lifeline, with a pleasant and relaxed pace.</p>
<p>Maybe the enemy is hiding in the camp, dreaming of home! Very smoothly, the team passed the railway safely. But everyone seemed a little disappointed, looking back at the winding rails, murmuring: "Didn't even see half a leg of a ghost!"</p>
<h3>New Year's First Writing</h3>
<p>— Wang Fen</p>
<p>A year bearing the heavy burden of life has quietly slipped away; chewing on the sorrow and joy that this year has left me, my heart is filled with an unspeakable taste. In my short life history, that year's life indeed left an indelible mark. However, joy or sorrow, apart from the imprint deeply engraved on the heart membrane, everything slipped away like smoke. A brand-new calendar hangs in front of my desk, and the clear writing tells me: this is the beginning of another year. What will these future days bring me? I can't help but feel lost again! However, the life of exile over the past year has tempered me quite a bit, making me quite resilient and strong; I can endure hardship and bear sorrow. Even if these days arranged before me are perhaps a hundred times more difficult than the past year, I also believe that I can get through them.</p>
<p>When I leisurely picked up my pen in the New Year of the year before last, I never even dreamed that the next New Year would drift to distant Hunan; just as last year's New Year, when I was walking in the snow in Xiangxiang, I never thought that this year's New Year would come to this prosperous and peaceful isolated island. Similarly, as I spend the New Year at this moment, who can say for sure where I will be today next year? Everything is unknowable, everything is dreamlike and fleeting, time is deceiving people, and fate is also teasing me. But isn't the meaning of life precisely in this kind of dreamlike fleetingness? I don't regard drifting as a bitter thing (there are said to be many people in the world who drift for life!), on the contrary, I think that drifting life, even exiled life, is also quite meaningful. Just say today last year, we were walking in the snow in that small county town; the north wind howled, scraping the accumulated snow piled on the mountain into the air, dancing around like butterflies for a while, and then falling down again; we were not afraid of the cold, holding onto the edges of our hats, trudging through the snow, watching the footprints left on the silver-like mountain, as if seeing our immortal career, left in the world. That kind of joy is indescribable for a moment! When we returned from the mountain, we drank some good wine, slowly drinking by the charcoal brazier, letting silence occupy this cold space, reminiscing about the shattered dreams of our homeland; listening to the children all over the street, running and shouting in the snow, setting off firecrackers, singing out-of-tune military songs, the sweet fantasy was shattered, a little tipsy on both cheeks, two lines of tears, but the heart was happy, because there seemed to be a bright lamp in front, illuminating my arduous journey. I like a life of constant change, drifting and exile are the most meaningful!</p>
<p>But now I am spending the New Year here. Joy and licentiousness adorn this difficult New Year. Who would have thought that on the other side of the country, a vast war is raging? Bleeding, death, running away, wandering, dominate most of China, while here, jazz overwhelms the groans of the victims, and erotic revelry almost swallows the ambitions of many young people. Is it a scene of peace and prosperity? Robbery, starvation, and killing, those are daily occurrences; it's good that there are no such spoilsport incidents before the New Year's feast; the isolated island's New Year, after all, arrives in joy.</p>
<p>The year placed before me is a mysterious puzzle to me. With a feeling of surprise mixed with anxiety, I will arrange these days well. But who can predict? This coming year? Listening to the sounds of the city all over the street, I feel lost again!</p>
<h3>Dog Beating</h3>
<p>— Mali</p>
<p>There are several grades of dogs: there are the tail-wagging, begging lapdogs, the mange dogs covered in stench, the vicious dogs barking indiscriminately, the mad dogs with poisonous fangs that hurt people; there are also some dogs that recognize thieves as fathers and ghosts as masters; and even some dogs that speak human language and pretend to be human but secretly exhibit dog-like behavior and do dog-like things. We have no name for these two kinds of dogs, so we call them yin-yang dogs, vicious dogs.</p>
<p>We humans must not indulge these dogs, nor can we be careless; otherwise, they will jump and steal food, bark and bite indiscriminately, not only making people uneasy but also causing people harm. If they form gangs and turn the human world into a dog world, that would be even more unthinkable!</p>
<p>Therefore, we humans must rise up and beat the dogs. Beat them with all our might: drive them out of the door, knock them into the water, and still not relax, but continue to beat them harder: beat them to death, beat them to a minimum, beat them all to death, beat them all to extinction; only when there is no trace of dog breath in our human world, will we stop!</p>
<p>Especially in this period of beating ghosts, everyone must be more careful to guard against dogs and bravely beat dogs. Beat to death those running dogs that help ghosts harm people, beat to extinction those thieving dogs that cause trouble from behind, only then can we destroy the ghosts' magic power, only then can we strengthen our human camp, and beat the ghosts to a state of falling flowers and flowing water!</p>
<p>Pay attention: dogs that befriend ghosts must be beaten, and dogs that are mixed among people must also be beaten; and be careful that those dogs that go out will turn their heads and show their teeth and claws, and those dogs that fall into the water will jump ashore and bite back, so we cannot but continue to fight desperately; at the same time, we must also be careful of those dogs that wear human clothes but are actually dog-toned and dog-like, will create opportunities and erupt with dog nature, and we must immediately watch them, lock them up, tie them up, and even take advantage of the convenience to beat them to death in silence!</p>
<p>Beating dogs is an important task in beating ghosts, everyone must not underestimate it. We humans, quickly pick up sticks and beat the ghosts while beating the dogs!</p>
<h3>Ode to Scorched Earth</h3>
<p>— Yiren</p>
<p>I sing the praises of scorched earth, I sing the praises of scorched earth.</p>
<p>The pendulum's tick-tock shattered the tranquility of midnight, striking my memory one by one.</p>
<p>In my memory, a blaze of fire, a cloud of black smoke, half the sky dyed red.</p>
<p>This fire, this darkness, spread, went mad; the tongues of fire licked the entire earth.</p>
<p>Everything was destroyed, everything was destroyed!</p>
<p>But, no tears, no sighs. A sigh, a drop, those are the symbols of the weak. Ah, we are iron infants forged in the crucible!</p>
<p>New life sprouted in the rubble, a free nation was built on this ruin!</p>
<p>And this fire will scorch dry the demons' blood; this black smoke will suffocate the demons' breath; this scorched earth will bury the demons' lives.</p>
<p>Scorched earth is the demons' tomb!</p>
<p>Forever, forever, our motherland will be built on scorched earth!</p>
<p>In my dreams, I also sing the praises of scorched earth!</p>
<p>Scorched earth! I sing the praises of you.</p>
