<p>歐戰從爆發到現在·爲時還祗一月有餘；而蘇聯在歐洲的勢力，却已獲得驚人的發展：兼併了波蘭國土的大部，愛沙尼亞成爲它的保護國，據說立陶宛·拉脫維亞·芬蘭等國，也將相繼入她範圍；同時她對於素稱爲世界火藥庫的巴爾幹半島，也有進行包圍的形態。最近土耳其與羅馬尼亞的外長相繼訪問莫斯科，聞土耳其曾建議組成一擴大的巴爾幹協商集團，以便維持眞正的中立；這個建議，連從未和蘇聯政府訂交的南斯拉夫，也都贊成。雖然目前英法土互助協定有舉行草簽的傳說，將使蘇聯的企圖，稍受影響；但是蘇聯並沒有放棄她對於巴爾幹的企圖。何况目前的情形，蘇聯旣沒有和英法採取敵對的態度，英法爲戰時利害打算，自不願干涉蘇聯在巴爾幹的活動；德國的討好蘇聯，更不必說；其他如羅保等國軍事的力量，决不足以和蘇聯抗衡，祗耍蘇聯稍微予以壓力，就不難屈從；所以蘇聯企圖在巴爾幹造成一種新局勢，這是很有可能性的</p>
<p>過去的巴爾幹，本是世界戰爭的酵母；她有極複雜的民族關係，以致屢决曾被列强利用，以擴大其經濟政治的勢力，尤其因爲她在地理上，踞於地中海的腹心，是一個非常重要的軍事據點；對於歐亞大陸，又是主要的交通站；因此種種，列强各有擁爲己有的野心。德國自吞併捷奧二國之後，若使實行侵略巴爾幹，眞是近水樓棗，最爲便捷；但是到了現在，德國爲穩定後方起見，不得不放棄了這個機會，更因國際的縱橫椑圔，未來的巧妙連用，也想促成蘇聯的問鼎於巴爾幹。個中關鍵，不但爲了戰時拉攏與國，或支持所謂和平攻勢；並且想藉此引起英法蘇聯間直接的亘久的矛盾，迫使蘇聯不得不和德國站在一條綫上，來對英法。因爲巴爾幹倘使也和波羅的海沿岸一樣，遭受蘇聯的控制，則影響到地中海戰時的軍事行動；即在平時，影響到歐亞兩洲的水陸交通，可以威脅英法兩國的殖民地。所以蘇聯若掌握了巴爾幹，將使英法寢饋難安，而終至於絕對不能容忍。到現在爲止，巴爾幹問題尚在醞釀排佈之中，猶未發動；但是側面的鈞心鬥角，已不可掩。即如英法與土其耳的締結互助協定，關於英法軍艦通過達達尼爾與博斯破魯斯兩海峽，自有直接關係；而蘇聯希望和土耳其提携，亦無非希望保持兩海峽的絕對中立，這所謂中立，也就是針對了英法將兩海峽加以封！</p>
<p>德國的這種策略，要在結歡蘇聯，逼上一條戰綫，使她不能不和德國採取同一的行動。不過另一面却又影響到另一軸心國義大利的利害關係了。義大利與巴爾幹，確有其密切的關係，義國自占領阿爾巴尼亞之後，除加緊對南斯拉夫的政治關係外，並極力在希臘保加利亞間活動；這在正面是自身的擴展，反面即是企圖阻止大日耳曼主義與大斯拉夫主義的伸入。如蘇聯控制了巴爾幹，這不僅將義大利向東歐發展的希望幻滅，影響到義國視爲內海的亞得里亞海，並且使義國直接感受强鄰的威脅，旣損失，又危險。這决義外長齊亞諾應希特勒的邀請而赴柏林，表面是爲了和平的攻勢，但是關於巴爾幹的處分，至少是義國方面所亟願明嘹的。可以說：義國朝野目前最所關切的，無過於巴爾幹的地位與權益。</p>
<p>巴爾幹的新局勢，現正在發展中，其變化如何，目前自難逆料；但是德國拉了蘇聯發表宣言，希望以旣成事實爲基礎，圖謀和平，英國已由首相張伯倫在議會表示峻拒了；昨夜羅馬電訉，義國不願在此時會。斡旋和議了；歐戰已無急轉直下的希望，成爲顯明的趨勢了。時間的延長，勢必至於促成空問的擴大。以吾們觀察，火燄延及巴爾幹半島的時候，必成爲戰局勃然擴大的重要階段！</p>

<p>日本中等敎育的敎員出身、事實上有所謂茗溪系、與赤門系之分、大概師範學校與高等小學校等、茗溪系佔優勢、而一般中學及高等學校則以赤鬥系佔優勢茗溪系者、是指東京高等師範學校而言、赤門系者指東京帝大而言、因日本爲培養中等學校的師資、本設有男女高等師範學校各二所、東京有男女高師各一所、此外則男設廣島、女設奈良、先是一八九四年、高等師範學校規程改正、分爲文理二科、置博物科於理科中、並定修業期間爲四年、其後雖時有變更、但仍不脫原形、現時高等師範學校、除分文理二科以外在京高師另有體育科、廣島高師有敎育科、又東京奈良女高師另有家事科、其外尚尙有專修科、選修科、更有使一般大學畢業生獲有中等學校敎員資格起見、特設研究科、東京廣島兩個高等師範、復分文科爲四部、（一）修身敎育公民科、（二）國語漢文、（三）英語、（四）地理歷史、分理科爲三部、（一）數學（二）物理化學、（三）博物、體育科中以體操與競技爲甲組、柔道與劍道爲乙組、家事科亦分二部、（一）家事、（二）裁縫、其本科修業四年、招收師範學校。中學校。高等女學校畢業生、不徵收學費業畢業後由敎育部指定其服務負有一定期間之義務、一九三三年、東京廣島兩高師升格而爲文理科大學、但仍保存原有高等師範學校爲其附屬、是爲其高等學校畢業生闢一轉進敎育界的新路同時、又可將高等師範的勢力擴展到高等學校及專門學校、因爲文理科大學畢業者、得一般中等學校免許狀外更可得高等學校乃專門學校之免許狀也、日本整個中等敎育界、差不多都是一脈相承、高師包辦了師範學校、師範學校又包辦小學校、這種機構、宛然把中小學敎師變成天皇中心主義的下層活動細胞、常然另外亦有由「認定」或「檢定」而來的中學師資、但在敎育界之實際、恐怕是如滄海之粟、毫不佔重要地位、</p>

<h3>金融　外滙鬆後猛緊　美滙晨初會到八元　買風盛反動突起</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、變動甚劇、中途起落靡常、令人殊難捉摸、情勢大致由疲轉堅、蓋初因外電香港等力售、兼西商沙遜及一般較小之中西投機家等亦傾向拋塞、雖其時匯豐與華行乘機納進、但趨勢則續見鬆動、一度英金曾鬆至四辦士七五、美匯亦曾硬達八元、英匯出現本年七月廿日後之最鬆價、美匯見八月五日破入八元關內後之最硬價、後以市上無稽謠言頗熾、傳英日改善邦交、及某部長辭職等流言、加之日紗廠棉花結款頗鉅、而華商等亦急極轉移目標、從事收買、英行匯豐亦巨量吸收、故狀况遂即奇緊、最軟英金計四辦士四〇六二五、美匯爲七元四〇六二五、午刻扒風稍戢、略形回平、以四辦士半及七元五二五收盤、結果較隔昨、英較美爲緊、英計一八七五、美爲二五、乃美對英匯兌漲起一分三七五之故、至十月份期貨、趨勢與現貨相若、半天交易尙旺、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期漲三七五、遠期升四三七五、紐約的銀價長二五、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對法均平、對滬大一五六二五、美對英升分三七五、對滬昂一角、對法大一分、中央掛牌各滙如舊銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士六八七五、美匯七元八七五、較之前收、英平美髮〇六二五、乃匯兌上漲之故、開後香港突來電塞、兼西商沙遜及一般較小之中西投機家亦跟踪吐出、故爲狀續見鬆硬、計外電與中西投機扒商相繼賣予匯豐·華比·大通。某行等外行及華銀行現貨英金由四辦士七一八七五、長至七五、並現貨美匯山七元九〇六二五硬達八元、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉大一分半、此後外行納胃愈佳、加之日行正金突來活動、故市况頓即回軟、計日行與外行有利大通吃進華商外行現貨英金中四辦士六二五、軟至五六二五、兼現貨美匯由七元八七五、緊至六二五、旋以外電復來塞出、並某行亦供意轉濃、故市象重趨鬆動、計外行吸進外電某行現貨英金四辦士六二五及六五六二五、兼現貨美匯七元六八七五及七八二五、時突謠傳某部長辭職之說、加之日紗廠棉花結款紛繁、華商等亦急起跟進、且銀行賣胃艱難、致情况又轉緊軟、計日紗廠及華商等結進外行現貨英金四辦士五六二五、縮至四〇六二五、並現貨美滙由七元六八七五、緊至四〇六二五、午刻爲狀稍形平靜、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士半、美匯七元五六二五、本月份英金四辦士四三七五、美匯七元四三七五、結果比上日現期、英均回緊一八七五、美亦俱回軟二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<h3>外幣漲多跌少</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况，除香港票續跌五分、及新加坡票降二角、荷蘭票小五角外、餘若英金票則尸隨匯市回漲八角、美金票一度曾到十三元七角半、卒爲十三元六角半、結果計漲三角半、英金鎊升二元五角、美金鎊昂一元、法郞票大一分、安南票及菲列濱票均高一角、坎拿大票升三角、日金票漲一分、朝鮮票大八厘、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3>英美銀價俱長　印銀猛落</h3>
<p>三日倫敦電、銀市印度買進、投機家賣出、市况堅硬、收盤後轉平、進者知足、大條銀、近期回長三七五、遠期回漲四三七五、紐約銀電、美現貨放大二五、又孟買銀電、印銀市况傾疲、現期貨均猛跌一羅比八安那、</p>
<h3>貼現平定　拆息掛小二分</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、每千元初仍在七十元左右、繼吿不支、步退至六十七元半、下午始見回上、終爲七十元、與上日價軋平、錢業公會之拆息、突見掛小二分、退至一角八分、</p>
<h3>現金欲跌反漲</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、起伏頗速、晨開虛弱、嗣後堅硬、全視外滙緊鬆爲轉移、藍初因外滙頗鬆、人心益疲、某錢兌業猛掀求售、且客帮需要不振、致晨開即降至三千九百七十元、又續退至三千九百五十元低盤、旋以塲中突流言紛紜、傳英日改善邦交、及某部長辭職等之無精謠言、兼同時外匯亦猛烈回緊、人心爲之一轉、證券帮與某錢兌等競相乘低猛進、某金號初亦跟進、後則獲利復出、但市價一度曾槃高至四千〇八十五元頂價、午劉因外匯略形回平、故降達四千〇四十七元收盤、午後外滙無市、情况遂稍轉平靜、但趨勢尙堅、經證券帮與某錢兌業復來拉提、由四千〇四十五元開盤、曾抬至四千〇六十元、結果以四千〇五十八元收盤、較隔昨漲起四十三元、交易上午尙旺、而下午轉淸、共的一千二百兩光景、銀樓飾金隨之掛高五元、海關金等仍均呆定無變、</p>
<p>烚赤回漲四十三元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開局勢頗疲、蓋以外滙鬆硬、買戶觀望不前、加之某錢兌業代門市散多吐售殷切、開市即猛撳四十五元、某錢兌業售予證券帮三十兩、爲三千九百七十元、開後某錢兌業賣意仍濃、做小二十元、某錢兌業塞予同業十兩、及現金號售予錢兌業二十兩、均爲三千九百五十元、時聞外滙回軟、某錢兌業代客力進、雖銀樓帮前來套賣、但頭寸仍感不敷分配、故趨勢頓堅、立回高八十元、金號進銀樓帮二十兩、便爲四千〇三十元、嗣因現金號等吐售、一度又撳小至四千〇十五元、後某金號代投機商突來猛吸、復抬高二十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、爲四千〇三十五元、旋以外滙復趨鬆硬、且某金號忽獲利復出、故復下疲、即降落三十五元、金號互做十兩、為四千元、此后謠傳某部長辭職之說、加之外滙猛緊、人心頓昂、證券帮及某錢兌業等代客力進、一時售者頗缺、價遂飛漲八十五元、金號互做二十兩、爲四千〇八十五元、午刻因外滙稍硬、漲風頓挫、立回小三十八元、證券帮吐予錢兌業三十兩、爲四千〇四十七元、作午牧盤、午後形勢頗平、開市做小二十元、金號售予錢兌業十兩、爲四千〇四十五元、後證券帮與某錢兌業相繼吸收百餘兩、遂抬高十五元、錢兌業進金號十兩爲四千〇六十元、繼之錢兌業互做十兩、爲四千〇五十八元作晚收價、結果比上日軋長四十三元、全天一百三十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進的减低三十元光景、現標金照掛牌價低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>首飾金昨掛大五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百〇五元、迨至十一時〇八分、掛大五元、此後無更動、結果大同行改懸四百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减小二十元光景、</p>
<h3>證券　公債晨初　買戶踴躍　午後受謠言挫折</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、文趨盤旋狀况、惟塲內抱樂觀者多、故市價易漲而難跌、午前承隔日漲勢之餘風、繼續趨漲、丙種曾高至四十六元八角、甲種衝出五十四元關、一時形勢極佳、買戶頗見踴躍、二十號買進爲多、永康泰源等號均有相當胃量，後以潤亨忽又大批賣出、的三十萬左右、漲風爲之一挫、但午收仍高半元左右、午後忽有某部長辭職謠傳、市上賣氣轉盛、市價即小去半元許、後以二十號及三十八號仍有進胃、乃得稍稍回堅、結果反小去五分一角至二角、獨戊種好一角、九六亦好一角五分、成交總數的計七十萬元左右、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股一百五十股、價爲五元三一角、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報吿云昨日股市、唯一特色、爲瑞鎔股之默然上騰、暨其罕有之鳳大交易、收盤時買方出價十一元五角、賣者需索十一元七角、耶松聯合船廠股亦猛漲至一百四十五元半中國墾殖股則略疲、共他股票殊少變化、</p>
<h3>紗花　現銷無望　棉紗一度傾跌</h3>
<p>紗市續趨下游、而市塲上人心大都看有好面、拖進做多者頗不乏人、故市面動態不定、忽升忽降、殊不一致、結果仍下挫、實緣現銷孱弱、香港對於滙兌管理嚴厲、銀款不能擅意匯出、華南方面採辦大受影響、惟本埠經營者意志甚爲興奮也、故情况遂呈徘徊之象、然在跌風時、買戶活動尤烈、所以稍遇良好消息、虛氣即吿銷滅、目前就其走勢方面觀測、一時深恐不易大漲也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣甚餒、為現銷無望、同業亦持觀望熊度、開價即跌十八元、二十支變馬現貨價爲七百五十元、棧單價爲七百二十八元、但低落後引起搶帽者活動、紛紛拖進、市盤微見回上、迨至將近收盤時、買戶忽然擁擠、市傳謂某部長有辭職之說、一時漲風驟起、一跳十元、査半日間成交統計九百八十包、上日英廠開出二十支五福。牧羊三星等紗成交二千六百五十包、兩日成交爲三千六百三十包、行情二十支雙馬跌六元、天女勿動、雙地球跌六元、鴻童廠開出十支新實彝一百包、價爲六百十二元、安達廠開出十支飛虎六百包、價爲五百八十五元至九十元、今日出口有二千〇四十五件運天津、又廿件運烟台、茲將各帮買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>內地一六〇同行六八五</p>
<p>寗波　三五雲南一〇〇</p>
<p>統計九八〇</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨日晨初因匯兌較長、各同業間交易心意頗爲淡薄、故市上交易殊爲靜寂、午市匯兌忽叉轉緊、交易略見鬆動、各方問詢者亦頗繁多、雖實在交易不多、西印度售價爲一百八十元、白洛區一百七十元、平果爾一百三十六元云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初即形軟弱、利物浦來電不良、跌落三五磅音不等、後因股票市塲之無力、及南方套賣者頗爲活躍、結果收盤價格較之上日跌十餘磅音、印度棉市略漲二羅比餘、埃及棉市跌六七十磅音、利物浦跌八便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　到頭日湧　粳米回降　蕪秈日商續拋價亦再小　獨蘆秈缺貨增高六七角</h3>
<p>國米昨以車輸包子抵埠較旺、有四五千包、人心益虛、本鄉作客寥寥、交易淸淡、故早市開手形勢即疲、行客販戶手貨多者均謀急脫、羣相甩價以引胃口、各貨市面一路下游、直至牧市仍無大胃、跌風益銳、各粳獨瀉二元左右、新粳亦降一元至元半、客尖跌一元有奇、羊尖則以去路較易、略貶半元左右、獨蘆尖以缺貨頗俏、增高六七角不一、計特常粳四十二元、中四十元、特錫粳四十一元、高四十元、中卅九元、蘇同崑粳叫十元至卅九元、新粳卅七元半至卅十元、楓涇百哥卅九元、早稻卅六元、羊尖廿八元决爲廿五元、蘆尖廿八元三角、决廿七元半、江北新尖廿二元二角、决爲廿一元八角、蕪湖尖廿二元六角、决爲廿一元半、砶尖廿一元、變元亦小元譜、開卅三四元、統計全市成交四千餘包、</p>
<p>另訊、客秈前日稍見回振後、貨方復又趁機吐出、而日商專利之蕪湖秈米續有整批暗出、雖秈米以價碼低宜、爲中下級食戶歡迎、內地鄉莊亦復以秈易粳、銷量獨旺、在廿一二元之低價本可站定、然以存底最豐、到數較多、昨由車輪到埠者仍有三四千包、且有棧貨虹口區貨求脫、因此高中各檔續小三五七角云、</p>
<h3>損失費尚在疏通　回籠粉跌風稍歛</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨粉市平庸、並無特色、二號粉廠盤仍站七元原價、回籠貨市面跌風亦稍歛、蓋緣近日南洋帮去化尙稱活動、香港廈門等處迭有裝辦、又傳福新廠徵收損失費事件、正在疏通辦法、故人心峪爲平定、咋日本街零批交易如常、北洋帮注意下脚粉、二號粉進胃平淡、兵船牌呈擯持之局、紅藍車砲車開價六元八角五分、紅藍福新六元八角三分、成交總數的計三萬餘包、</p>
<p>小麥　昨小麥來源到而不多、因產價迄未鬆賤、貨主售意尙堅、惟銷塲方面、尙乏開展、市面一時亦無進展之力、統市僅由囤戶方面購進五車、福阜兩廠辦去一千六百包、價俱呈平疲、</p>
<h3>疋頭　絨布當令　成交大旺</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨受東疋棉紗跌價影響、人氣略軟、粤港新交易、呈觀望態度，染廠綏辦坯布·細布·細斜、交易驟淸、市盤殊爲紊亂、每疋跌一角至二角半、惟粗布·絨布、以本街及內地帮銷塲活潑、價仍堅昂、漂染布疋以漂染費步增、故坯布略跌、開價仍平、本街及囤尸成交粗布·粗斜一千餘包、門市批發各布號以絨貨當銷、添辦大旺、襯絨斜紋絨花色絨布成交七八千疋、蘇北泰州等地辦細布·粗布五十包、色布·色斜三千餘疋、滇帮辦縐紋呢三十餘箱、色布·印花色丁　貨二千餘疋、粵帮甬帮新交易稍淸、定貨裝發仍極擁擠，</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>白貨昨以客銷呆滯、俱趨下遊、細布·細斜續降第疋二角半至五角、晨市龍頭細布跌至二十二元、後市稍昂、但成交寥寥、全日本街染銷及同業心思交易、僅五六百件、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>疋頭五日運烟臺二十一件、運天津八百七十一件、</p>
<h3>糖市　與化糖已到滬　洋糖交易轉盛</h3>
<p>昨糖市據荷蘭電訊、即裝粗白價升至荷盾九·七〇、香港電B嘜車白定價港幣一五·七五、公會劃盤初平後緊、形勢較佳、而交易亦轉增、現貨二四粗白本棧五十四元、外棧五十二元半、後達五十四元、共成交七八百包轉口貨小四角、以四十元六角、成交四百包、太古車白B嘜東棧仍爲五十七元八角、西棧初爲五十八元、後升至八元半、共成交一千二百包、餘嘜照退、H嘜軍赤四二元七角、升一元、荷赤四十三元半、升五角、本綿白升一元、一號五十五元、二號五十四元半、三號五十四元、四號五七三元半、本冰升度相同、一號爲六十六元半、晶明冰六十八元、國產興化赤白山神光永利等輪統共運到六七千包、正在報提中、號盤勢必稍鬆、不日即有正市矣、</p>
<h3>海味　螟蜅淡菜　俱見猛升</h3>
<p>螟蜅　以來源稀少、去化不弱、市勢隨之猛升、近日寗波貨售四十元、比前漲起五六元、舟山貨更尠、爲八十元、烟台貨爲七十五元、漲十餘元、</p>
<p>淡菜　亦因到少關係、刻市子淡售一百七十元、上莊二百元、如稍大隻三四貢已須二百二十元、約升起五六十元之譜、</p>
<h3>南北貨　海南圓肉　較升十元</h3>

<h3>駕遠東航線英商船　已奉令配備武裝　皇后輪業已裝配完竣　每艘裝巨炮及高射炮　英海軍頒商輪禁令星島已施行檢查</h3>
<p>英商行駛遠東航錢各輪船、除由駐遠東艦隊、嚴密保護各輪外、並實施商輪武裝政策、不准公佈船隻航行日期、頒佈商輪行駛海上禁令、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>實施商輪　武裝政策</p>
<p>英商行駛遠東航錢各輸船、如昌興·太古·怡和等公司、奉令實行商輪武裝政策後、今日本皇后·亞細亞皇后·加拿大皇后·等輪、均已裝配完竣、每艘裝有高射砲兩門、巨砲兩門、各輪之武裝、係由倫敦等處裝置、砲位平時均屬隱蔽、非必要時不輕露出、星加坡海軍船塢、已奉令承裝各商輪武裝設備、至行駛中國沿海噸位較小之太古怡和各輪、尙未有此種裝置武裝凖備、其裝置目的、在平時可保護航行之安全、在必要時可以供給政府微用、担任軍事上之運輸、</p>
<p>頒布商輪　行駛禁令</p>
<p>英海軍頒佈商輪各頃禁令、（一）非得長官命令、不得發出無綫電、答復任何報吿、亦不得用無綫電發出報吿、更不得用無綫電爲外國戰爭人員報吿水雷或其他防務之危險、但無綫電警號倘爲執行安全者得發出、（二）一切英國商船、在海上時、入夜須將航行燈縮小或黯淡、並熄滅一切船內燈火、並盡力使於破曉時抵達口岸、而在海上更須避免接近武力地帶、（三）自九月五日起、一切輪船、不得經過甘馬河之東西岸、査上述禁令、已由海峽殖民地航務處通告各英商輪執照、</p>
<p>星島檢查　外來船隻</p>
<p>星加坡已實施檢查外來船隻、其辦法如下、（一）一切外來輪船、欲進入星加坡港者、須先駛至龜嶼檢查處停泊、受檢査後方能進入領港、（二）目即日起、進入海港或由海港駛出者、實施引水制度、引水小輪停於龜嶼附近、（三）凡輪船欲進護浪堤者、須先駛至檢查處、貨物起卸後、必須駛經由實叻新基駛至西部轉至南部、再由大島經過（四）在輪船抵達檢査處之前、特別旗號必須繼續、檢査輪係藍色、船首高懸特別檢査旗幟、在夜間輪上高懸白燈三盞、每一盞距離約六尺、此種檢查係防止敵方奸細及危險品之進入該地、</p>
<p>英法游輪　到滬延期</p>
<p>航輪之船期、以郵船最為準確、除發生人力所不及之事故外、決無延遲時刻之舉、但近來因受歐戰之影響、交戰國郵船航程船期、遂亦不能準確、又因各公司對進出口船期、嚴守秘密、致外界異常隔阂、茲探錄最近郵船動態錄後、昌興公司俄國皇后號此决由溫哥華來滬、按照船期、應於本月二日到滬、三日開往南洋、今始于昨晨抵埠、停靠虹口公和祥碼頭、定今日起椗、赴香港小呂宋·法國郵船公司佛力士羅素號郵船、照例應於上月二十九日到滬、親改今日進口、亦停虹口公和祥碼頭、聞該輪此决不赴日本、在滬逗留數天、定十日由滬返歐、荷商渣華郵船公司新郵船芝楂運加號、船期準確、第三决來滬已於前日（二日）到埠、現泊十三十四號浮筒裝貨、定今日下午起椗、回返爪哇、</p>
<h3>日電臺攪亂　美國播音</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（三日）據本埠備無綫電之外僑聲稱、日方新設無綫電臺一座、於已往兩夜、用英語廣播新聞、而完全擾亂美國自舊金山寶島所廣播之新聞、日方電臺所舉呼號為JZK與JZJ、於美國向東方開始廣播新聞時、同時開始播音、而其電波、與舊金山美國通用電臺合法保持之電波相同、致匕海不能收聽美國之新聞廣播、日方該電臺且妨碍收聽倫敦經香港而傳來之新聞廣播、上海美僑喜收舊金山美國新聞廣播者、現正促請駐滬美總領事對日方電臺加以注意、並立即致書美國貿易專員史密斯女士、昨日傍晚前、史女士已繕就正式詳報、送呈華盛頓、敦促美國有關當局對於此事、加以注意、</p>
<p>京滬路華軍活躍　龍潭路軌被炸　機車貨車傾覆交通中斷　楊墅園一帶日軍又慘敗</p>
<p>京滬鐵路沿綫因華方游擊隊之活躍、上月間曾有兩次路軌被毀車輛傾覆之事發生、頃悉、本月二日龍潭車站附近、又有貨車被炸出軌、以致京滬路上交通、再度受阻，茲將各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>龍潭附近　路軌被炸</p>
<p>上月十二日新豐與渣澤間路軌毀壊、繼以二十八日晩橫林與戚墅堰間、被華方游擊隊安地雷、以致有滿載軍賽貨物之一列車傾覆、日方對此兩次事變、亦均予以證實惟對其損失程度、未予宣布、昨日復據報告、二日晨有由南京開出之貨車一列、於行至龍潭站附近、忽又以路軌被炸、以致機車煤水車及裝有小麥之貨車三輛、傾覆於該處相近小橋樑之處、因此一日京滬間客車及日方軍需車復被阻滯、日方嗣雖力謀修復、然因工程關係、暫又未能恢復通車、</p>
<p>楊墅園鎮　日軍被殲日方鑒於沿線時有事故、曾於橫林車輛出軌後、多方偵查該項地雷之一切綫索、嗣復派隊向運河之南一帶搜査、二十七日行經無錫縣境胡埭附近、與華軍自衛團相遇、開火二小時、日軍因寡不敵眾、即行退卻三十日有洛社日軍三四十人、乘輪船一艘、開赴楊墅園鎮搜查、事為華軍自衛團西區特務大隊周漢良得悉立即率所部徐梅初等迎上、在北街梢開火、日軍猝不及防、結果日小輪一艘擊沉、日軍死二十人、被擒五名、餘均受傷、翌日該鎮被日軍放火焚去房屋數間、</p>
<p>竟圖利誘　人民獲路</p>
<p>另據大光社記者昨向運輪業方面探悉、日方以京滬交通、時遭破壞、頗感焦慮、特由「華軍鐵道社」設立所謂「愛路課」、由日人井本擔任課長、企圖勸誘沿線各地居民、共同擔任維護鐵路之責、並於前晨七時十二分、由北站開出專車一列、滿載大批日用物品、由井本負責指揮、在沿線各站、以低價出售各種物品、乘機向人民宣傳、勸誘共同維護鐵路交通、如發現有人破壞時、隨時向各站報告、但一般人民、深明大義、對日方此舉、咸多蔑然處置之、亦徒見日方之心勞日拙而已、</p>
<h3>日本武裝學生　經法防區被阻　相持兩小時法軍未通融　嗣由英軍允許通過返校</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、同文書院日籍學生百人、各執步槍、星期一日自海格路該校校舍列隊出發、向虹橋哥爾夫球總會區而行、未得許可、逕自經過英軍防區、返校時、企圖經過法軍防區、惟法軍不准、因彼等又未獲得許可也、此輩學生、乃待於法軍防區外、歷兩小時、而以</p>
<p>終宵靜坐</p>
<p>不去相恫嚇、卒由英軍出爾調停、護送若軍、經英軍防區而返、惟已禁止彼等復以軍事行列而經過英軍防區、本埠日文報紙今日對於法方召出裝甲汽車兩輛及機關槍隊、「」之舉、加以抨擊、查同文書院</p>
<p>交通大學</p>
<p>校舍中、因虹橋路之同文書院校舍於一九三七年華軍後退時已被摧毀也、同文書院校舍、雖在界外馬路、實際上乃在英軍防區與法軍原來防區以外、然日文報紙竟抨擊法軍於「一九三七年未曾有效的防衛該校舍」、日籍學生星期一日係列成</p>
<p>軍事行列</p>
<p>經海格路與陸家宅路而行、日文報紙雖稱學生未携軍器、實則彼等均携步鎗、若輩雖未向英當局要求而獲得列隊經過之准許、但英軍仍准其出防區、日籍學生於歸途中、企圖經過一九三七年華軍撤退後由法軍接防之區域、而取道虹橋路返校、法哨兵不准彼等入境、因其未獲列隊</p>
<p>通行許可</p>
<p>也、日籍學生並未企圖循原途經英軍防區而返、法軍旋請彼等留下鎗械、准其入境、日籍學生不從、對峙良久、卒從英軍官之建議、而經英軍防區返校、滬英軍司令西蒙斯少將、旋接該區日軍指揮官之道謝、</p>
<h3>偽「統稅局」　定雙十節移交</h3>
<p>日方統制下之「蘇浙皖三省統稅局」「局長」邵式軍、任事迄今、業已腰纏累累、僞「維新政府」方面以該缺係肥職、屢思染指、終無結果、最近探悉該「局」將於雙十節移交於「維新政府」轄、南京僞組織聞已派遣僞員由南京乘車來滬、辦理接收事宜云、</p>
<h3>美亞洲艦隊司令　赫德昨日抵滬　麥令司對定期設宴歡迎　擬十一月中赴南海巡閱</h3>
<p>美國亞洲艦隊旗艦奧古斯太號、懸三星標上將旗幟、於昨日（四日）下午三時、由青島抵滬、停泊新關碼頭附近江面、擬在滬駐泊一月、俟十一月中、赴南海作冬季之循例巡閱、赫德上將到滬後、尙未訪美總領事高斯、亦未傳見任何賓客、惟據大中社記者探悉、駐滬美海軍陸戰隊麥令司隊、已定於本月十二日、假座法國總會、舉行盛大宴會、歡迎赫德上將及其僚屬、麥令司隊並已凖備在跑馬廳內會操、由赫德上將檢閱、屆時或當邀請駐滬美國高級官員及駐滬外國軍官暨司令等覜操、至浦江外艦、自連日美艦大理石號·英艦蚱蜢號·蜻蜓號·駛離後，頓形寥落、昨日因奧古斯太號旗艦到滬、又復壯觀矣、</p>
<p>此後採取　積極行動</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國亞洲艦隊、某員今（四日）晨聲稱、美當局現取較諸本週初所宣布者更强有力之方法、對於遠東美艦之行動、將來絕不披露情報、此項最近命令、亦適用於海軍人員之妻、而將於軍艦確實開到時、始行通知彼等云、關於亞洲艦隊旗艦奧古斯太號定今日午後三時自靑島駛抵上海、並未宣布何種變更、然亞洲艦隊總司令赫德海軍大將是吾乘奧古斯太號艦來滬、或仍留共私人快艦依沙佩爾號上、則因今晨宣布之最近命令、而未能獲得消息、蓋當局未曾發表依沙佩爾號之預定行程也、</p>

<p>西報記者昨謁工部</p>
<p>局總裁費利浦、詢越界築路交涉經過、費氏駁斥日發言人所云最近費氏曾與僞市長傳筱庵會見費氏調、一月以前、余等曾在市中心心會唔、此後即未會謀面、日發言人所指、或係一月前事、記者又詢以日方要求工部局准予租用緊勤路屠宰塲事、費氏謂、此案須俟董事會討論後決定、日方要求之內容此時恕不能發表、惟此事實屬十分重要、因目下租界肉料、大部係該宰塲供給、又英文大美晚報云、工部局總裁費利浦、今（四日）晨駁斥日方發言人近在招待新聞記者席上所發言論、據費氏語記者稱、自一閱月前、渠與市長」傳筱庵在市中心區會談以來、並未續開會議、日方發言人或係述及一閱月前舉行之會談云、關於工部局接得日方若干私人方面申請租借肇勤路之工部局宰牲塲事費氏聲稱、此事須待工部局會議時提付討論云、日方申請之詳則、今晨未能公布、惟費氏認爲此事在目前頗爲重要、因供給公共租界之肉類、大多經該宰牲塲而來也、</p>

<p>西式住宅　昨被占據</p>
<p>極司非而路九十九號（開納路西）前日下午有日憲兵僞警百餘名、分乘卡車、前往佔據、將該屋所有住戶、全數逐出、惟內部附設之慈聯分會第卅三收容所、未遭干涉、昨日復增加日憲兵僞警約二十餘名、現大門由憲兵四名看守、另闢一側門、供難民出入、查該屋係西式住宅、位在日憲兵西區司令都之斜對面、內有大廣塲一方、</p>

<h3>從「性靈」到「賊」（下）</h3>
<p>— 消人</p>
<p>誇誇爲明朝死節的人，甚至弔弔明朝底皇帝，也都可以的，因爲「大淸」也在獎勵忠臣，還要表示「本朝」底「寬大」，—這只要看看「明史」上所說的淸世祖也去哭崇禎底皇陵，便可以明白。但有一點，却是「大淸」認爲最要緊的事，你們得使勁地去說「賊」的殘酷，因爲那樣便能够呌大家記得「大淸」給你們平了內亂，同時也足見亡明朝的是「賊」而不是「大淸」了。但這種政策恰恰就合了淸初那些「隱逸」底胃口。那些「隱逸」其實有些是拿了淸朝底官俸生活的，這法子對於他們底身份便是合式到極點了：一面表示自己不忘前朝，上面又不得罪「本朝」。於是他們在筆下盡可能地給淸兵穿上禮服，盡可能地給「賊」塗上花臉。</p>
<p>然而「賊」對於亡了的明朝並不是沒有奮鬥過的。常時的「義民」，雖然爲目前我們靑年文士所不屑道，但畢竟都是爲民族犧牲的人物，可是他們所號召的羣衆却就是騷動的農民，也就是一向所說的「賊」，而且實際上也有許多就是從李自成底隊伍中來的。「賊」並不是我們一向所理解的那種只知道殺人放火的「强盜」。</p>
<p>但我們底靑年文士却偏要忠實地抄着淸初「隱逸」底著作。這除了使人想到是承繼「性靈」派文士底文統以外，再就使人想不出是甚麼用意了。</p>
<p>這些文士，將來有什麼結果，現在還是「帶住」，且看將來的事實罷。</p>
<h3>延安邊区印刷工友</h3>
<p>— 葉棻</p>
<p>二十四小時中生活剪影</p>
<p>夜色還沒有褪盡，陽光已透露出牠的頭頂一角，幾朶媚人的彩霞輕貼在太空，是那麼艷麗。</p>
<p>淡薄的晨影漸漸塗上了大地的四周，顯映出山河的輪廓，石畔淺草更被輕拂着。在淸凉山的西南角上，數百十個小鳥般的人們開始在活躍了。那是邊區印刷廠的工友們在學習野戰的鏡頭啊。他們行動緊張，忙着前進，劈刺，埋伏，包圍，前面彷彿正有着頑强的敵人在等待着他們呢。</p>
<p>他們的影踪掠過了這個山頂，又掠過那個山頂，接着聽雄壯的歌聲響處是他們完畢了這一個課程。每個人用手帕抹了抹掛在臉上的汗水，帶着輕鬆的微笑，是那樣高興的踏回山脚來。望望東角，陽光已在不知不覺中露出了牠整個的面容，把他們的歸路照料得這麼明朗，淸新。</p>
<p>當陽光輕輕地爬進窗隙，軋朗的機聲從大雄寳殿開始揚起勞動的邪許。這一羣戰十們，已收蓄了他們黎明時那種熱在的情緒，奔放的姿態，而是變成那麼的鎭靜，像是被鉛字盤和機件吸住了似的，用着他們粗大的手，敏捷地在抓取亮星般的字粒和摺疊着雪片似的一堆堆印刷品—這裹是「列寗選集」，那邊是「聯共黨史」，還有「解放報」，「新中華報」，由幾個勤務同志把它一大批一大批送往裝釘間；那裝釘間中正由十幾個女的工友們在操勞着；爲着這裏還沒有備具新式的裝釘機，她們多是在用着兩隻纖小的手代替，幹着「整齊」，「打眼」，「紥鐵絲」等工作，藉以完成這些書報的容貌。</p>
<p>嘈雜的聲音轉臨到山底下的荒塲上，陽光正打了個直角，像一羣築公路的小工，分散成爲幾個小堆，各堆圍着一二罐的靑菜荳芽，站立着草草用他們的中膳。他們愉快地咀嚼着嘻笑着，……餐畢，休息。停回就在這裏開始了打球——「籃球」和「足球」。</p>
<p>球兒在翻滾，騰踔，他們底心更活潑，彼此像猛虎出柙般衝突着。球兒圓得像酷烈的太陽，是這麼的頑强，他們只是不斷的搫着，玩弄着。他們淌着汗，不停地追逐，盡着興，感到充份的愉快，竟相對的微笑了。</p>
<p>陽光像是在鑽無底的深洞，由光亮處步入黯淡，而至朦朧，延安的四周這樣沒在深沉中。</p>
<p>今晚的上空假如有個借光之物，你就在進萬佛寺的直徑上可以看到他們三五成羣的影子，要是上空偏偏一些什麽也沒有，那當然會使你感到非常的神秘了吧？如果你有顆好奇的心，就不妨去那條路上摸索摸索，給你們脚兒步步高登。（註一）在你慢慢兒摸到盡頭的地方，便會被你見到一盞半明的燈火在伴着團坐着的他們，在靜聽着一個人的「講」。</p>
<p>樣模倒有些像是南方邨落裏的說書塲所，講的人是這慶的有聲有色，聽的人叉是這麽津津有味，可是這裏沒有嗑瓜子的聲音，更沒有烟捲的奥味。是的，你只要再逼近些，更可以隱的地見到他們還不住的在用鉛筆往紙上迅速地劃着呢。</p>
<p>他們是在上課吧！这是他們每天二十四小時中所有的事情，除了早上練習野戰，日間作工外，晚上還有着這麽的一個課程——「統一戰綫敎程」。</p>
<p>註一：那裏的路是築</p>
<p>在山腰裏，逐漸高昇</p>
<h3>小唱</h3>
<p>— 徐野</p>
<p>琴聲</p>
<p>更深時，何處送來古希臘的惋切的琴聲？</p>
<p>不但耳聽到琴的聲音，祇一說到琴的名字，我就有莫名的感觸。</p>
<p>這感觸深沉地囓着心頭，沒有一刻不會記取的，爲了琴，爲了心愛的琴，我曾經在悠長的日子裹懷念着。</p>
<p>琴是來目新加坡，一個朋友從馬來亞帶回祖國來；這位朋友是歌師，研究了好多年的西洋音樂。</p>
<p>他喜歡唱悲多汶的歌曲，俄羅斯的船夫曲，他高興嚎着古羅馬的名歌，而且，在南洋他學會了義勇軍進行曲。</p>
<p>記憶的恰也是秋夜色，有明月，有流星，他單獨地踽步於小河之邊。</p>
<p>從咽喉裏唱出一支渾壯的歌，琴又在他的手指間動彈了，吸引了一羣孩子，他們喜歡這從未聽過的音樂。</p>
<p>「唱得嗎？跟起我，第一句是起來……」</p>
<p>「起來，起來……」</p>
<p>不久，孩子們唱了，跟着他的琴聲，配成一隊排伍，在黃昏，這聲音如雷吼，如海嘯，像在風撲過平靜的湖面，驟起着無數波浪，激盪着奔騰着</p>
<p>「唱船夫曲，不，是馬賽歌！」</p>
<p>「哦！總是來一决我們的義勇軍進行曲頂好！」</p>
<p>這樣，我唱着，一直唱過了很多的晝夜。</p>
<p>十月了，我們的歌者不見了，他留給我僅有這支來目馬來亞的提琴。</p>
<p>珍奇地把琴藏着起來，他吿訴我去雲南，四川，我知道他現在健好在古老的延安城裹</p>
<p>可是，琴如何？它是吾安息在故鄉的書架上，是吾濛着一陣濃厚的灰塵？弦弓也許受着蠹蟲的侵蝕？但，誰能訴說砲火彈烟下的那支提琴的去處？希冀的是琴的戰鬥，它不至變爲無恥者的樂器，現成的便是大衆的號角，在勇士的手中它會怒吼出進行曲和馬賽歌！</p>
<p>夜闌的古希臘風的琴聲漸漸地靜寂了，我細看簪在雲層的上弦月，忽然悵念着失去的提琴。</p>
<p>我失去的琴就讓它失去罷</p>
<p>“各有所特”</p>
<h3>雜感二題</h3>
<p>— 藍雯</p>
<p>十字架</p>
<p>一個十字架接聯着另一個十字架，我的思想却左右伸展至無極。</p>
<p>是白骨換來的日子呢！那矢志的忠貞，那獻身的熱情，總該是一個鼓舞與招呼吧？</p>
<p>時代替這古老土地上的居民，鑄好了十字架。爲了生存，咱們都得背負起來呢！</p>
<p>你我都得做一個殉道者。</p>
<p>天寒矣</p>
<p>西風吹落桐葉，也搖曳了我的情感，天寒矣！</p>
<p>我們是活在這樣的城市裏，花花綠綠的紙頭糊住了人的心竅。良心已是多餘的名詞了。</p>
<p>抬起頭，我看見枝頭籠中美麗的鳥兒——我不能說出牠的正確的名字。啁啾的呌喚，是歌唱生活的美滿與舒適嗎？</p>
<p>可憐的柬西，你不嫌籠中天地的狹小？你沒有無從飛翔的惆悵嗎？</p>
<p>鳥乎？人乎？舉目眺眺吧！我們這地方也是鐵絲網的世界呵！</p>
<p>可是，就在鐵絲網外，不甘於奴隸境遇的人，榦着莊嚴偉大的工作。爲了自由，他們流了血。</p>
<p>天寒矣！我記起了戰士的衣裳。怎麽辦呢？</p>
<h3>來鴻</h3>
<p>— 楊棣</p>
<p>是沙漠中一株綠草，</p>
<p>從窒息中暫時透過口氣來，</p>
<p>啟發的愛美的自然的心思，</p>
<p>要奔向無際的原野。</p>
<p>像黑暗中的閃電，</p>
<p>雖是在一霎時間，</p>
<p>也看見了天空和大地向前摸索，憑着記憶。</p>
<p>白鴿從遠方飛來，</p>
<p>賜給我一個心底激動，</p>
<p>「能不能讓我跨上你的背，</p>
<p>載我回至那光明的泉源？」</p>

<h3>影業偉大貢獻—「說明聽筒」　大光明將開始供應</h3>
<p>— 舒曉春</p>
<p>國人愛觀外國影片，然外國語造詣不深者，往往不能領略劇情之奥妙，祇能觀其動作表情而已，是以片中人偶作幽默輕鬆之妙語時，舉座西人，哄然大笑，而國人之不諳外國語者，竟瞠目不知所云，是誠美中不足也。故劇情婉轉對白特多之佳片，輒不及劇情平庸，動作較多之普通片賣座，或亦即此原因。影片公司爲補救此項遺憾起見，常於片上加映華文字慕，但手續麻煩，且必須運往日本印製，中國現尙無此項設備；而影院方面，有於銀幕旁放映說明燈片者，但亦多簡略，且無論片上加映字幕或放映說明燈片，在觀衆方面，均覺有顧此失彼之虞，近聞大光明戲院爲澈底改進此點，特費鉅資，首先裝置最新型之「說明聽筒」，如屬時間可能，聞即擬於短時期內開始供應云。</p>
<p>所謂「說明聽筒」，與套在頭上之無綫電耳機髣幫，取用時，祇須將綫頭揷於座旁「撲落」內，戴於耳上，即可聽得國語說明及對話，詳盡明白，且無碍於雙眼之視綫，聽歌唱時，祇須將聽筒取下，片上原音，亦能聽得，蓋片上仍無時不在發音，至「說明聽筒」內之國語說明，另由該院隨時按劇情翻譯播送。其能通曉外國語之觀衆，自可勿用此種聽筒，且亦無雜聲擾亂聽覺，故此項設備，有百利而無一弊，是誠偉大之貢獻也，特預誌之。</p>
<h3>港影近訊</h3>
<p>— 翠屏</p>
<p>胡蝶與陳圓圓　胡蝶新作題材初傳爲「楊貴妃」，繼傳爲「菲島血案」，後又有攝陳圓圓故事之說，現聞因時下電影市塲，古裝片易收營業之效，決先攝陳圓圓，劇本已經編好，更名爲「絕代佳人」，此片仍採「胭脂淚」辦法，分攝國粵語兩種聲片，新華公司與此間南粤公司合作，王决龍導演，王乃東，唐槐秋，彭飛等合演。</p>
<p>中國泰山竣事　新華公司在港攝製，王决龍導演，大力士彭飛，黎灼灼，王乃東，白茵等主演之「中國泰山」（泰山歷險記改名），全片已告竣事，此片大部採取香港著名天然風景區爲背景，崇山峻嶺，深川大澤，氣勢極爲雄偉，其中允以泰山築巢之一株巨樹，樹身四人不能盡圍，該樹名榕，已逾千歲，枝根相速，如人工接幹支撑者然，濃蔭葱蘢，佔去空間約一畝地（據云該樹如伐作木料，可售萬餘港金），泰山之片爲此生色不少。飾泰山之彭飛，此决係重登影界，曩年藝華公司創辦之初，彭曾主演「烈燄」，「民族生存」，今次飾中國之泰山，其一身强健體格，足與西方泰山韋絲摩勒頡頏，而其蹂升跳躍技能，亦見特長，他如王乃東，黎灼灼等表演，以及導演運用技巧，均有特色，聞以後將連續攝製云。</p>
<p>盧翠蘭嫁牛郎　盧翠蘭在港主演夏衍改編之「牛郎織女」民間故事古裝片，由唐槐秋及中旅劇團人馬合演，近已完成，原擬於中秋節出映，因不及在預定期內攝竣，現改於雙十節放映，聞此片頗有時代意義，初定名「大地之花」，茲已改名「新天河配」。</p>

<h3>談吳素秋之元宵謎</h3>

<p>元宵謎爲小留香館荀蕊生獨有名劇之一，在平津聲譽之盛，與梅畹華之鳳還巢，程玉霜之荒山淚，尙小雲之上元夫人，具有同樣聲勢。當吳素秋投拜苟門之日，留香即以「元宵謎劇本作爲贄見之禮。並吿之曰：「此項脚本，爲陳墨杳先生得意作品之一，唱作之繁，情節之佳，堪與「　頭鳳」並傅不朽，今以贈汝，幸永永寶之，他日在滬出演，定能載譽而歸也。」素秋唯唯稱謝。聞吳伶此來，即擬以此劇打泡，惟以編排費時，未能如願以償，現經一星期之排練，全劇配角，均已純熟，在最短期內，（大約在本星期五）即可開始公演。此劇劇情，忽悲忽喜，極哀感頑艷之能事，茲述其概要如下：</p>
<p>呂昭華禮部尚書剛中女，字郭生廷章，未婚而廷章父歿。郭氏固貧，剛中恐廷章失學，館之於家，値上元節，剛中夜出，歸詣廷章所，則見男女二人並枕臥，儼然昭華興廷章也，駭且怒，顧以家聲所系，隱忍趨避，明日始斥廷章，廷章不遜，剛中大怒，逐廷章，且責其夫人趙，而迫昭華死。會詔使以帝命召剛中去，昭華仍欲自殺，趙夫人不能止，而母舅趙班侯適至。班侯曩以總兵鎭邊，寄其女秀英於趙夫人處，時則將赴廣東提督任，爲迎女來也。至是，留秀英侍趙夫人，逕携昭華行，而以巳死報剛中。廷章之見逐也，憤甚，馳書毀婚約，顧爲班侯所見，懼重傷昭華之心，秘其書，則亦坦然爲昭華擇婚。居有頃，新學使章麟閣者來，少年科第而未婚，班侯乃以昭華字之，有成議矣，而昭華不可，憂傷致病且甚，班侯乃遠迓趙夫人勸慰昭華，病行間，旣而窺見章麟閣者，即其故夫郭廷章，始無異詞。廷章以剛中知貢舉，故易名登第也。將婚，剛中亦以冊封琉球，返自廣東，班侯延之觀禮，父女翁壻相見於一堂，乃得一一解釋前此之誤會云。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>伶人與鴉片</p>
<p>慶奎與叔岩兩人都是烟嗓，不過他倆的使用方法，却逈乎不同。慶奎喜在出台時拚命賣力，有多大勁，使多大勁，以致弄到後來氣不接了，嗓音愈唱愈小。當他在勝利灌「哭秦庭」時，一句倒板，佔了一分多鐘，工程師就不甚滿意說一千塊錢一片，一面只三分鐘，公司裏花了五百塊錢，只買兩句唱，似乎太不値得。允其他的嗓音是近於劉跛一路，如能專學鴻聲，不要兼唱孫派的「逍遙津」勉强用力，他的嗓子決不會壞得那般快。叔岩每値出台時，嗓音極低小，有時且帶沙啞之音，但入後則愈唱愈亮，朗澗充實，反而絲毫不顯費力，如此方見出「工夫嗓」的可貴，同時叔岩的善於運用，亦非他人所可及也。</p>
<p>後來聽得人說，慶奎的烟又抽了回來，但是嗓音依然未能恢復，由此可見鴉片與伶人的嗓音，其關係更爲密切而重要了。至於當他戒烟之後，他的聲帶忽然會變的沙啞發不出音來，這裏邊究竟是怎麽回事，還得請敎精於醫學的人們，來仔細研究一下。</p>
<p>我有一位同學姓吳的醫生，曾在德國學醫，專研肺癆科，據他吿訴我：許多德國名醫，皆承認凡有肺病的人吸食鴉片是有利的。這個原因就是因爲鴉片有收歛性，要說它能治療肺病，尙不敢必，不過它能維持原狀，不致使有肺病的人由第一期而進入二期三期。還有一層，凡患肺病者最怕咳嗽過劇，震壞心肺，病勢豈不日益加劇。鴉片既有止咳止喘的功效，所以它不但有裨於患肺癆病者，同時對於伶人登台演唱之際，可使其不致咳喘不止，妨礙其行腔使調，此亦伶人酷嗜鴉片之最大原因也。（一一三）</p>

<h3>四羽毛</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Fonr　Feathers”</p>
<p>「四羽毛」是英國亞歷山大戈達公司的出品，它是一貫地宣揚英國軍隊征服菲洲土人的勳功偉業。但是它激勵民衆應該勇敢地站在最前綫，爲祖國效勞，在「此時此地」的我們看來，「四羽毛」的故事也是値得我們推崇的。</p>
<p>故事是這樣的：英國北薩立聯隊奉命開拔埃及的前夜，哈雷突然請求退位。他的同僚韋羅貝，裴羅士，杜倫司等譏其懦弱，臨陣退縮，各膾以羽毛一枝。哈雷爲雪恥計，決隻身往埃及：救護他的三位朋友，並且帮助英國軍隊將土人擊潰。</p>
<p>「四羽毛」的演出正如「鼙鼓聲動」一樣，導演者是竭其全力於幾個戰爭的大塲面，醫如：（一）英軍總司令命裴羅士，韋羅貝及杜倫司統領少數英軍去誘致土人的時候，土人的圍攻，英軍的抵抗，馬隊奔馳，火箭四射，英軍卒因寡不敵衆，悉數被俘；及（二）哈雷秘密將鋼銼交與裴羅士，密謀逃遁，時英軍適大隊來攻，於是裏應外合，把土人擊潰。這兩塲戲，織剪的緊凑和塲面之偉大，在在都顯示了導演者卓越的手腕。而哈雷救護杜倫司的一節，更使人激動。如：哈雷醒來以後，他救護杜倫司到營帳中；杜倫司擬執槍自戕，哈雷奪去其槍，用手杖扶着他走；在絕裂的沙地上尋水源；到河畔，縱身到水里。這里，導演者利用倉鷹在天空飛翔的黑影，來陪襯地面上兩個活人的危險，利用各偭艱難困苦的畫面，來加强他們眞摯的友誼。—這精緻細膩的手法，感到比他處理大塲面更可愛。其他如哈雷喬裝土人，在河畔拉縴時的運用歌聲，鞭聲，及十年前哈雷入睡時，他執着臘燭，燭光映過一張張英武的照片等，也都精緻可愛。</p>
<p>演員以演杜倫司的賴甫李郤遜最好，他從受太陽的毒光，傷害了眼睛之後，他的戲都非常認眞。的翰克里門士（哈雷）也沉着有力。</p>

<h3>Hua Army Recaptures Xiangyin County Seat; Fierce Fighting on the North Bank of the Miluo River; Japanese Forces on the South Bank, Except for Ying Tian and Xin Shi, Completely Eliminated; Several Japanese Divisions Encircled in the Mufu Mountains, Facing Starvation</h3>
<p>Changsha: The Hua army, having captured Jinjing this morning, advanced victoriously northward and recaptured Jiangpu (west of Pingjiang County) at 1 PM this afternoon. Simultaneously, another unit of the Hua army captured Shapu (north of Fulinpu), and Hua guerrilla forces, taking advantage of Japanese unpreparedness, captured Xiangyin County at dawn on the 4th. Currently, various pursuing units of the Hua army are exerting their utmost efforts to eliminate the remaining Japanese forces on the south bank of the Miluo River. (Urgent telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Hua army in the Xiang region has been advancing continuously for days. After eliminating and routing the Japanese forces in the areas of Shangshih City, Qiaotouyi, and Fulinpu, the Hua army is now engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese forces in the area north of the Miluo River. (Telegram, 3 PM, 4th)</p>
<p>Changde: The battle on the outskirts of Changsha is about to come to an end. The Japanese forces that crossed the Miluo River southward along the railway and highway lines have been routed after the Hua army’s continuous suppression efforts over the past ten days. They are retreating in disarray towards the north bank of the Miluo River. Strongholds such as Shangshih City, Qiaotouyi, and Guanlinpu have been retaken by the Hua army in recent days. The Japanese forces in Jinjing have also been eliminated. The Hua army, except for a part encircling and annihilating the remaining Japanese forces entrenched in Ying Tian, is mostly clearing the battlefield along the Miluo River and pursuing northward in separate routes. According to reports, this battle was launched when Itagaki of West Kun came to China to take command. His intention seemed to be to gather the main forces in central China to take Changsha in one fell swoop, threatening Zhuzhou and Hengyang. However, through the calm command of Hua military officers and the fierce attacks of loyal and brave soldiers, not only is Greater Changsha still safe, but many Japanese cemeteries have been built north and south of the Miluo River. The Japanese situation has become like the withered leaves of late autumn, and its decline is becoming increasingly obvious. (Telegram, 3 PM, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, this city received military news from the Hua side in Changsha stating that several Japanese divisions are currently encircled in the Mufu Mountains in northeastern Hunan province, and their food supplies are only sufficient for five days. Yesterday morning, the Hua army recaptured Fulinpu, a crucial village northeast of Changsha. A unit of Japanese forces that had infiltrated the mountains between Xiushui (transliteration) and Tonggu, attempting to encircle Changsha from the southeast, is now encircled on three sides, north, south, and east, by the Hua army. The fate of Changsha may be decided by the battle currently taking place in the Mufu Mountains. (Reuters telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Fulinpu: The war situation in northern Hunan is indeed turning in favor of the Hua. Most of the remaining Japanese forces on the south bank of the Miluo River have been encircled and annihilated by the Hua army. As of Shen time on the 4th, only a few strongholds, such as Xinshi, Miluo, and Ying Tian, still have some remaining Japanese forces holding out for reinforcements. The Hua army is sending powerful units to search and advance. The thousand-strong Japanese forces entrenched in Qiaotouyi have had their supply lines cut off, and it should not be difficult for the Hua to annihilate them all within days. (Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Changsha: Jinjing (east of Fulinpu) on the Xiang-E Highway has also been recaptured. There were originally over a thousand Japanese soldiers stationed there. After Fulinpu and Liqiao were successively captured by the Hua army, the Japanese forces in Jinjing felt increasingly isolated. Yesterday, the Hua army launched a pincer attack and annihilated most of them. The Hua army then recovered the stronghold on the morning of the 4th. In recent days, the Japanese forces invading southwards have been forced to retreat northwards. The Hua army is pursuing swiftly, with the vanguard already approaching Bijimiao, and a part has crossed the north bank, intercepting the retreating Japanese forces. Japanese corpses are scattered all over the fields, and the Hua army has seized countless war spoils. (Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Amakasu Division, after being defeated by the Hua army at Changji Street, fled north in a panic. A portion was annihilated near Maishi, a portion was routed by the Hua army, and another portion continued to flee north. On the 3rd, they fled to northeastern Pingjiang and were again surrounded and fiercely attacked by the Hua army. The Japanese forces had no will to fight and broke through to the north in a rush. In this battle, the division suffered extremely heavy casualties at the hands of the Hua army. The number of corpses left behind, which they did not have time to transport, reached over 3,000. The Hua army is still pursuing fiercely. (Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: News from Hankou states that the number of Japanese soldiers killed in the recent Japanese invasion of northern Hunan exceeds that of any previous decisive battle.

Additionally, three accompanying reporters were also killed. (Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Hengyang: The Japanese forces in northern Hunan were annihilated by the Hua army to the tune of over 10,000 in two weeks. The Japanese vanguard has been almost completely wiped out. The remaining forces are collapsing northeast, and the Hua army is pursuing victoriously, encircling and annihilating them separately. (Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese military authorities, some of the soldiers currently fighting on the outskirts of Changsha are farmers from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces who only started training after the fall of Wuhan last winter. In the past few days, thanks to the loyal and brave resistance of these men and other troops, Changsha, which was already in a dangerous situation, has turned from danger to safety. According to Chinese military authorities, the residents of Changsha and all public and private institutions and materials have been evacuated. Therefore, even if the Japanese forces were to capture Changsha, it would have no military value. Useful houses have been burned by the Hua side, and telegraph and telephone lines, as well as all kinds of scrap iron and wooden pillars, have been transported away. The bridges in Changsha have all been demolished, and the Yuehan railway tracks have been dismantled to several miles south of Changsha. Therefore, even if the Japanese forces were to capture Changsha, they would gain nothing. (Associated Press telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Newspapers here today continued to publish news of the victorious counterattack by the Hua army in northeastern Changsha in a special place. The Central News Agency's Changsha correspondent telegraphed last night, "The Xiang River is碧水平静, reflecting the stability of the front line in northern Hunan.

Foreigners in the Kaifeng area claim that a small number of Japanese troops and a large number of puppet troops are stationed in Bian City. Last week, the Hua army took the opportunity to shell the suburbs of Bian City and intensified activities in the vicinity. Due to the scarcity of Japanese troops and the uselessness of the puppet troops, it is impossible to drive the Hua army out of the territory. (Associated Press telegram, 4th)</p>

<h3>No Red Army in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Regarding the news from foreign sources in Shanghai that Soviet troops have entered Xinjiang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here has no knowledge of it. According to Hua officials, this rumor may have been fabricated by the Japanese side because the bulk of the Soviet troops are concentrated on the border of "Manchukuo," and the Japanese cannot but try to divert the world's attention. According to Soviet sources here, this rumor is purely anti-Soviet propaganda. (Associated Press telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>London: According to Japanese news received here today, to corroborate reports of Soviet troops entering northwestern China and Xinjiang, it is claimed that two regular Soviet army brigades recently arrived in Urumqi in northern Xinjiang, followed by troops entering the province.

<h3>The Situation in the Balkans</h3>
<p>The European war has been raging for only a little over a month, but the Soviet Union's power in Europe has already seen astonishing growth: it has annexed a large part of Poland's territory, Estonia has become its protectorate, and it is said that Lithuania, Latvia, Finland, and other countries will successively fall within its sphere of influence. At the same time, it is also encircling the Balkan Peninsula, which is known as the world's powder keg. Recently, the foreign ministers of Turkey and Romania successively visited Moscow. It is said that Turkey proposed the formation of an expanded Balkan consultation group to maintain genuine neutrality. This proposal was even supported by Yugoslavia, which has never had diplomatic relations with the Soviet government. Although there are rumors of an impending initial signing of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey, which will slightly affect Soviet ambitions, the Soviet Union has not abandoned its designs on the Balkans. Moreover, in the current situation, the Soviet Union has not adopted a hostile attitude towards Britain and France, and Britain and France, for wartime interests, are naturally unwilling to interfere with Soviet activities in the Balkans. It goes without saying that Germany is trying to please the Soviet Union. The military strength of other countries such as Romania and Bulgaria is definitely not enough to compete with the Soviet Union, and it will not be difficult to yield with a little pressure from the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is highly likely that the Soviet Union will try to create a new situation in the Balkans.</p>
<p>In the past, the Balkans were the breeding ground for world wars. It has extremely complex ethnic relations, which have often been exploited by the great powers to expand their economic and political influence. Especially because of its geographical location in the heart of the Mediterranean, it is a very important military stronghold; for the Eurasian continent, it is also the main transportation hub. For these reasons, the great powers each have the ambition to possess it. Since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia and Austria, it would be most convenient to invade the Balkans. However, now, in order to stabilize the rear, Germany had to give up this opportunity. Moreover, due to international maneuvering, it also wants to promote the Soviet Union's ambition in the Balkans. The key is not only to win over allies during the war or to support the so-called peace offensive, but also to use this to cause direct and lasting contradictions between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, forcing the Soviet Union to stand on the same line as Germany against Britain and France. Because if the Balkans were controlled by the Soviet Union like the Baltic coast, it would affect military operations in the Mediterranean during wartime; even in peacetime, it would affect land and water transportation between Europe and Asia, and could threaten the colonies of Britain and France. Therefore, if the Soviet Union controls the Balkans, it will make Britain and France restless, and eventually absolutely intolerable. So far, the Balkan issue is still brewing, and has not yet been launched; but the side-by-side contest is already undeniable. For example, the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey is directly related to the passage of British and French warships through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits; and the Soviet Union's hope to cooperate with Turkey is nothing more than hoping to maintain the absolute neutrality of the two straits. This so-called neutrality is aimed at Britain and France sealing off the two straits!</p>
<p>Germany's strategy is to please the Soviet Union, forcing it onto a battle line, so that it has no choice but to take the same actions as Germany. However, on the other hand, it also affects the interests of Italy, another Axis power. Italy and the Balkans do have close relations. Since Italy occupied Albania, in addition to stepping up its political relations with Yugoslavia, it has also been actively involved in Greece and Bulgaria; this is an expansion in the front, and on the reverse is an attempt to prevent the extension of Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism. If the Soviet Union controls the Balkans, this will not only shatter Italy's hope of developing towards Eastern Europe, affect the Adriatic Sea, which Italy regards as an inland sea, but also make Italy directly feel the threat of a strong neighbor, causing both losses and danger. This is why Italian Foreign Minister Ciano accepted Hitler's invitation to go to Berlin. On the surface, it was for a peace offensive, but at least the disposition of the Balkans was what Italy was eager to clarify. It can be said that what Italy is most concerned about at present is nothing more than the status and rights of the Balkans.</p>
<p>The new situation in the Balkans is now developing. How it will change is difficult to predict at present; but Germany pulled the Soviet Union to issue a statement, hoping to seek peace based on the established facts. Britain has already resolutely rejected this through Prime Minister Chamberlain in Parliament. Last night, a dispatch from Rome stated that Italy is unwilling to mediate peace talks at this time. The hope of a sudden turn in the European war has become a clear trend. The extension of time will inevitably lead to the expansion of space. In our observation, when the flames extend to the Balkan Peninsula, it will become an important stage in the sudden expansion of the war!</p>
<h3>Germany's Policy on the European Situation: Hitler to Announce Policy at Week's End; Mussolini Denies Plans to Launch Peace Movement; Daladier Scheduled to Clarify France's Position Today</h3>
<p>The Hague: The "Telegraph" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that Führer Hitler will convene the Reichstag on the 6th of this month to announce his policy on the European situation. French Premier Daladier is scheduled to deliver a speech tomorrow. Its content will definitely be closely watched by Führer Hitler. In addition, after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returns home, he will immediately attend the State Council to report on his talks with Führer Hitler. The decision of the State Council is still unknown, but it is said that the suggestions of Führer Hitler will be conveyed to the British government through diplomatic channels today. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German official news agency received a dispatch from Rome today stating that Italian authorities have denied rumors that Mussolini is currently studying a peace conference plan, calling it unfounded, and saying that Italy will not take such an initiative in the current environment. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: Rumors are circulating that the British government has received a document from Rome containing peace proposals. Official sources here have firmly denied this. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: There are many rumors about Führer Hitler's upcoming peace offensive. Responsible officials here have stated that the British and French governments have not received any suggestions. Although Hitler has tried to persuade certain neutral countries to act as mediators, it seems that they have all declined. Therefore, Hitler probably no longer hopes to submit a concrete plan to Britain and France through neutral countries, but will only state it when he delivers a speech in the Reichstag. If so, then Britain and France do not have to regard it as a direct or formal proposal from the German government, and the response to it will naturally be simpler. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German political figures believe that Führer Hitler will deliver a speech to the Reichstag at the end of this week, discussing the military and political results after the Polish war. Now that the Polish war has ended, Berlin political figures say that Germany will exert efforts on political and diplomatic activities in the coming days to determine whether the Central Powers want to engage in war or restore peace. Berlin sources point out that although there are widespread rumors that Germany has no intention of "Germanizing" Poland, nor of ruling Poland by "force," it should be known that Poland was originally a country comprising several ethnic minorities, with Poles accounting for only half of the total population. To forcibly unite the various ethnic groups would be a violation of the principle of national self-determination. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Today, a certain high-ranking official of the German Foreign Ministry stated that Chamberlain's speech did not provide a clear and incisive answer to our political debate on the issue of war and peace. Authoritative sources here solemnly stated that Germany's attitude towards the current situation was clearly expressed weeks ago. In a nutshell, Germany's wish is for peace. Therefore, there is no need for Germany to issue special peace proposals. Führer Hitler will deliver a speech in the Reichstag this weekend. The German side's opinions on the situation, which have not yet been expressed, will be delivered by Hitler himself. German authoritative sources say that the Foreign Ministry does not intend to take any action before the Führer delivers his speech. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: Judging from the news received here after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returned to Rome from Berlin, Hitler's peace offensive will be launched in an extremely clever manner, which at first glance will make people think it is acceptable. Representatives of neutral countries will present Hitler's attempt to seek peace in the form of a victory belonging to democratic countries. The fait accompli of Poland will be "explained" in a way that appears not to contradict the victory of Britain and France. However, news from Rome says that well-informed Italian sources predict that the Italian government will not immediately launch any peace movement, as Italy is unlikely to devote itself to a futile action that has no hope of success in the current situation. Italians admit that it is difficult to imagine that Germany's peace proposals can be accepted by Britain and France. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Nazi Party sources stated last night that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, while in Berlin, jointly studied the possibility of European peace with the German side. Germany expressed its gratitude to Italy for maintaining its friendship with Germany in the prolongation of the war. The cooperative power of the Berlin-Rome Axis will become stronger in the future. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Meeting: Premier Attends to Report on Military and Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>Paris: The cabinet held a State Council meeting at 10:00 this morning, which ended at 12:15. Premier Daladier immediately reported on the diplomatic and military situation. Its content has not been published, but according to reliable sources, Daladier not only expressed his approval of the firm statement made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday, but also reiterated that Britain and France have a completely consistent understanding of the peace offensive that Germany may take diplomatically, militarily, and economically. If Germany formally puts forward peace proposals, Britain and France will exchange views in order to take a common countermeasure. In addition, Premier Daladier is scheduled to attend the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon to deliver a speech and report on the current situation. In short, Premier Daladier's repeated statements have been unanimously supported by the country. This statement regarding Germany's peace offensive will also be approved by the British government. In other words, any peace proposal that is based on the fait accompli created by German aggression, or is guaranteed by Führer Hitler's empty words, will be rejected by the Central Powers.

<p>Oslo: According to reliable sources from Berlin, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov plans to go to Berlin this month in return. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Polish Forces Launch Guerrilla Warfare: Continue to Resist Aggression; Eastern Swamps Serve as Base; German and Soviet Forces Find It Difficult to Cope</h3>
<p>London: Moscow Radio last night admitted that although Warsaw has fallen, Polish forces continue to resist Soviet and German aggression. "Polish guerrillas" are attacking behind the Soviet troops, especially near Pinsk. Polish guerrillas are "desperately attacking Soviet troops and supply teams," and the announcement admits the difficulty of eliminating the guerrillas, because they are hiding in the eastern swamps. The Soviet Union is working to clear the Polish guerrillas in the swampy areas to prevent future troubles. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A communique published here today admits that in the area between the former border and the newly demarcated German-Soviet border, there are still sporadic Polish forces engaged in resistance. The communique also stated that since September 30, the German Navy has intercepted a total of 72 ships. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a communique this afternoon, stating briefly that on the eastern front, there was a slight battle, and the German army was clearing up the remnants of the Polish army between the first German-Soviet demarcation line and the new demarcation line of the German and Soviet spheres of influence. On the western front, the battle situation was calm, with only some artillery battles in the Saarbrücken area. In terms of economic warfare, 72 merchant ships have been intercepted since September 30. Some merchant ships were forced to enter German ports because they were transporting contraband. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: It was announced here that a grand German military review will be held tomorrow in the suburbs of Warsaw to commemorate the end of the Polish war. Important German military and political figures will participate in the parade. (Haitong, 4th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Actively Expanding Power: Moscow's Diplomatic Activities; Mutual Assistance Treaties Agreed with Lithuania and Latvia; Baltic Sea Gates Completely Controlled</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to the German news agency, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys arrived in Moscow today. Urbšys's trip is related to the reported Soviet desire to conclude a mutual assistance or non-aggression treaty with Lithuania. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: Molotov and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys held talks last night. Stalin, Potemkin, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Lithuania Pozdnyakov, and Lithuanian Minister to the Soviet Union Nakevičius were all present. The two sides had a cordial conversation for more than two hours. (TASS, 4th)</p>
<p>Kaunas: Foreign Minister Urbšys returned here by plane from Moscow this morning. He will immediately report to the government on his talks with the Soviet authorities and listen to instructions before returning to Moscow. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys, accompanied by his personal secretary Svaistas and Minister to the Soviet Union Nakevičius, flew to Moscow yesterday. Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Lithuania Pozdnyakov and Commercial Representative Yefanov returned to the country at the same time. Those who welcomed them at the Central Airport at that time were Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lozovsky, Deputy Commissar for Foreign Trade Stepanov, Deputy Chairman of the Moscow Soviet Yasnov, Chief of the Treaty Department of the Foreign Affairs Committee Bakov, Director of the Baltic Department Vasukov, Moscow Garrison Commander Refejin, Deputy Director of the Treaty Department of the Foreign Trade Committee Mishutin, Lithuanian Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union Batunas and all embassy staff, Estonian Embassy Counselor Ohison, and First Secretary of the Latvian Embassy Alberts. The Central Airport was covered with the national flags of the Soviet Union and Lithuania to express welcome. (TASS, 4th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov met with Latvian Foreign Minister Munters for the second time yesterday and held talks for a long time. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Riga: Supreme Court President Ozols recently flew to Moscow to assist Foreign Minister Munters in conducting talks with the Soviet authorities. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Tallinn: The Soviet military delegation recently arrived here and will immediately discuss the establishment of land and sea military bases in Estonia in accordance with the mutual assistance treaty recently concluded between Estonia and the Soviet Union. It is reported that the Soviet Union intends to build fortifications on the southeastern coast of the island of Vormsi in Estonia and on the northern coast of the island of Hiiumaa, so as to control the port of Riga (Latvia) and the Gulf of Finland. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: Pravda published an article today discussing the status of Estonia, stating, "Estonia is strategically important due to its geographical location and has always been coveted by imperialist countries attempting to expand their economic and political spheres of influence. In 1919, the British Navy used it as a base to attack Kronstadt, resulting in the loss of 21 ships and a humiliating retreat. Britain attached particular importance to the Moonsund Islands and negotiated with Estonia to purchase Vormsi Island among them, hoping to establish its naval base in the Baltic Sea there. After the war, the British Navy sailed to Estonian waters every summer. All of this is extremely noteworthy. Since the signing of the Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Pact, the Soviet Union has obtained the right to establish several naval bases and airfields in Vormsi Island, Hiiumaa Island, and Paldiski Town. From then on, the possibility of using Estonia as a base for operations against the Soviet Union has been eliminated. This pact has greatly changed the balance of power in the Baltic Sea. The possibility of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet protecting the safety of the Soviet Union's sea borders has been greatly increased, and at the same time, Estonia itself has been further guaranteed." (TASS, [date])</p>
<p>Moscow: Regarding the issue of Romania's Bessarabia province (which belonged to Russia before the last European war), it is widely rumored here this morning that the Soviet Union will immediately make a request to the Romanian government. It is generally believed that this issue will not be difficult to resolve. At this time, Soviet troops are concentrating near the Romanian border, and its munitions factories in Sevastopol on the Black Sea coast are working day and night to manufacture military supplies. The port implements a curfew every night at 10:00, and the number of troops stationed in the port of Odessa has also been greatly expanded. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Mexican Government Does Not Recognize Situation Created by Force</h3>
<p>Mexico City: Today, the Mexican Foreign Ministry responded to reporters' questions about the status of Poland, saying that the Mexican government will never recognize any conquest based on force. (Reuters, [date])</p>
<h3>Results of Soviet-Turkish Negotiations of Deep Concern to Britain: Turkish Foreign Minister Remains in Soviet Capital Awaiting Instructions; Soviet-Bulgarian Negotiations to Conclude Broad Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Moscow: Well-informed sources here recently stated that Turkey intends to provide guarantees to the Soviet government that it will strictly adhere to neutrality in the current European war, even if the Soviet Union and Italy are involved in the war. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu will stay in Moscow for four or five more days to await instructions from his government. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Milan: According to the Popolo d'Italia, British political circles are extremely concerned about the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. Reports from Moscow have even caused consternation among the British. Even the most optimistic British people must now admit that the extension of the Moscow negotiations shows that the Soviet Union has not yet made its final statement. The Soviet Union may force Turkey to adopt strict neutrality. In other words, the Dardanelles Strait (the translator refers to the gateway to the Black Sea) is determined to be closed, and a neutral group with real strength will be established. Britain's plan to encircle Germany will be overthrown. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The Turkish military delegation arrived here yesterday and will begin discussing the affairs of concluding a mutual assistance treaty with Britain. It is believed that the British-Turkish mutual assistance treaty will be signed in Ankara within a few days. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: It was rumored that the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey was initialed in the Turkish capital last week. It is now known that this statement is not entirely accurate. Although the negotiations between the three countries are progressing smoothly, the mutual assistance agreement cannot be initialed until Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu returns from Moscow. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The Frankfurter Zeitung recently published an article commenting on the situation in the Balkan Peninsula, stating, "The Soviet Union and Bulgaria are currently negotiating a broad commercial treaty. The friendly relations between the two sides can be seen from this. In Yugoslavia, diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union will be established within a short period of time (note: Yugoslavia has not recognized the Soviet Union since the Russian Revolution). All of this is a good omen, but how to deal with the large number of White Russians residing in the Yugoslav capital may cause some difficulties in the negotiations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: Colonel Baitev of Bulgaria, who is responsible for concluding the Soviet-Bulgarian aviation treaty and opening an air route between Moscow and the Bulgarian capital, has been in Moscow for many days. He was received by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov yesterday for talks. It is said that the treaty is expected to be signed within a few days. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<h3>German Delegation to Moscow for Economic Negotiations</h3>
<p>Moscow: The German economic delegation led by Schnurre set off for the Soviet Union and is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on the 7th of this month to negotiate with the Soviet authorities on improving the efficiency of Soviet raw material production. It is said that the negotiations are conducted in accordance with the terms of the German-Soviet economic agreement. It is reported that the members of the German delegation are mostly well-known heavy industry experts and transportation experts in the country. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 59, stating, "The enemy repeatedly attacked our side east of the Moselle River and the Saar River today, but were all repelled. The artillery teams of both sides also bombarded each other in that area." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris: A French military expert summarized the strategic importance of the areas gained by the French army on the western front in the Petit Parisien, saying that the French army has occupied 100,000 acres of German territory, and a part of the outposts outside the Siegfried Line are now also owned by the French army. There is a narrow strip of land several kilometers wide between the current battlefield and the Maginot Line, which serves as a barrier to the Maginot Line to prevent long-range German artillery fire. Therefore, German artillery does not damage the Maginot Line. If the German army wants to launch a large-scale offensive, it must first attack its lost land. Even if the French army retreats, the German army must still conquer the defenses recently built by the French army and suffer the fierce fire of French machine guns. The German army will see the Battle of Verdun again. A war bulletin from the French Command Headquarters recently stated that the enemy's strong attack east of the Moselle River and the Saar River has been repelled. Artillery teams of both sides are active in the area. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Zurich: After the government received news yesterday that German troops were concentrating on the Swiss border, it ordered the recall of all army personnel on leave and reinforced the border. The Swiss government fears that after the Anglo-French rejection of the Soviet-German peace proposals, German troops will attack France via Switzerland. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: Officials announced that 24 German fighter planes were shot down in September, and 8 French fighter planes were also lost. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>German Midget Submarine Appears: South American Waters, British Ship "Clement" Confirmed Sunk by German Submarine</h3>
<p>Bahia. It is now definitely confirmed that the British ship "Clement," which was sunk in South American waters a few days ago, was indeed sunk by a German warship. According to an American news report broadcast today by the Rome radio station, the ship that sank the British vessel was the German midget battleship "Admiral Scheer." It is reported that the British ship's crew took a photo of the German warship before transferring to lifeboats. The crew members drifted at sea for thirty hours before being rescued by the Italian ship "Itaitinga." (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>German Warship Grounded: Neutral Country's Ship, Germany Demands Ship Movement, Obey Submarine Signals</h3>
<p>Riga, Latvia. The Latvian ship "Imanta" was intercepted yesterday by a German warship in Swedish territorial waters and ordered to sail to Kiel, Germany. According to a telegram from the embassy in Germany, the ship has been released and is sailing back to its home country. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden. The Swedish cargo ship "Götaverken," carrying wood pulp and paper, was sailing from Finland to Wilmington, Delaware, USA, when it was intercepted by a German warship off the coast of the Sandhamn archipelago and has been taken to a German port. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Oslo, Norway. The Norwegian government has received a note from the German government stating that all Norwegian ships, if they encounter German submarines, should immediately obey their signals and allow the crew to board and search the vessel, and must not attempt to escape. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Stockholm. Germany has sent a note to Sweden warning against "improper conduct" by Swedish merchant ships in the waters near England and France. The content of the note is the same as the one sent to the United States yesterday, stating that neutral ships have repeatedly attempted to evade the right of stop and search allowed to the German navy under international law. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Oslo. The captain of a Norwegian ship, sunk by a German submarine outside Bergen, Norway, on September 29, stated today that the German submarine commander refused to inspect the ship's identification papers because he was under orders to sink all ships carrying cargo to England.

<h3>US Naval Training Fleet, Blocking Japan if Necessary, Hawaii-Based Fleet Strong, Commanded Personally by Rear Admiral Andrews</h3>
<p>Washington. The United States' attitude towards Japan is becoming increasingly tough. Naval officials are ignoring Japanese newspaper reports that the US action is an "armed demonstration against Japan" and are vigorously defending the US government's right to send a fleet to Hawaii without prior consultation with Tokyo. The Navy Department claims that the purpose of establishing a security patrol fleet is for training, but Washington officials point out that the naval action may cause diplomatic disputes. The Navy Department confirmed that the 45 warships sent to Hawaii last night are under the personal command of Rear Admiral Andrews, a strategic expert. The fleet will be stationed in the central Pacific on an indefinite basis. Naval circles announced that Rear Admiral Andrews has broad authority and may increase the fleet's strength at will if he feels it is necessary. If the naval bases of San Diego and San Pedro are "too crowded," the Navy Department plans to continue sending other fleets to Hawaii to participate in the security patrol fleet. The fleet consists of a total of 45 warships, including 8 cruisers, and the aircraft carrier "Enterprise" carrying 80 aircraft. In addition, there are 34 destroyers and 2 destroyer tenders. Naval officials in San Pedro stated yesterday that the establishment of the security patrol fleet is to protect the west coast of the United States, from Alaska to the equator. Unofficial sources here indicated that the fleet sent to Hawaii, if supplemented with submarines and aircraft currently stationed in Hawaii, would become an ideal "blockade" fleet. This fact can be seen as highly significant, as rumors here suggest that the government plans to impose an embargo on arms and raw materials to Japan after the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty, which will be abolished next January. The security patrol fleet may be training along these lines to be able to implement a blockade at that time. This view is widely considered possible, as naval authorities have announced that Rear Admiral Andrews has the authority to continue to deploy fleets to Hawaii if he feels it is "necessary." If the current fleet is only for routine training, the original fleet would be sufficient for the exercises, and there would be no need to add other warships. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong. It has been learned here that after 15 US heavy bombers flew to the Philippines last week, the strength of the US Asiatic Fleet will soon be increased by at least six submarines and one supply ship. However, some quarters here say that these submarines are only replacing the original ones. It is expected that three submarines will arrive in the Philippines from Hawaii on the 15th of this month, and the other three will depart from the west coast of the United States on the 15th of November. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The "Kokumin Shimbun" today published a commentary on US Secretary of State Hull's recent statement refusing to recognize the Soviet occupation of Polish territory, condemning the United States for hypocrisy and irresponsibility, and stating that President Roosevelt should bear some of the responsibility for the European war, because he once declared that the border of the United States was on the Rhine, which in fact implied aid to Britain and France. If the Rhine was indeed the border of the United States, as Roosevelt declared, then the United States should have joined the war, but the United States declared its neutrality and remained aloof. The newspaper also said that the United States is strengthening its fleet in Hawaii and Manila at a time when Chiang Kai-shek's policy is about to collapse, which is tantamount to diverting Japan's attention and providing spiritual assistance. The "Asahi Shimbun" also criticized the matter, saying that it is noteworthy that the United States and the Soviet Union, who often united in the peace front, have now suddenly become estranged. The newspaper also mentioned President Roosevelt's congratulatory telegram to Stalin, saying that the US President's shock at the Soviet occupation of Poland is only natural. The newspaper concluded by saying that according to Moscow news, the United States wants Japan to go to war with the Soviet Union, which is similar to the attempts of Britain and France to conspire to promote a war between Germany and the Soviet Union. This shows that the United States' indifference to the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement is not without reason. According to the "Mainichi Shimbun," it is natural for Britain and France to refuse to recognize the German and Soviet occupation of Polish territory, but Hull's statement has indeed given the final blow to all peace movements in Europe. The US government determined its attitude towards Poland after consulting with Britain and France, but the result is only to prolong the European war. In short, Hull's statement is a further indication of the United States' intention to participate in the European war. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Honolulu. In addition to sending 49 naval vessels to the Hawaiian Islands, the United States is now also planning to strengthen Hawaii's air defense equipment. A large number of aircraft are expected to arrive in Hawaii this month. The fighter planes will be capable of flying 300 miles per hour, and the bombers will be comparable to those currently used in Hawaii. In addition, the aircraft carrier "Enterprise," carrying 80 aircraft, will arrive first among the 45 warships. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington. Congress is very satisfied with the government's dispatch of 45 warships to Hawaii to establish a "security patrol zone." According to diplomatic circles, the United States' dispatch of a part of the Navy to Hawaii is a clear attempt to enhance the United States' position in the Pacific, and at the same time to express the United States' attitude that, although neutral, the United States is also a world power, and if its legitimate rights and interests are violated, the United States certainly has the right to take military and diplomatic action. Democratic Senator Gerald Nye, a member of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, stated, "The sailing of our warships to Hawaii is purely a domestic matter and has nothing to do with international affairs." Moreover, our sea defense is based on the Aleutian Islands, Hawaii, and Panama as lines of defense. The movement of ships in this area is purely our domestic affair and need not alarm others. The opinions of others, such as Ellen T. and Bapuo, are also the same as Bora's. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>US Senate Suspends Debate Due to Death of Senator Logan</h3>

<h3>Pan-American Conference Concludes, Three Declarations Adopted</h3>
<p>Panama City, Panama. At a plenary public meeting held last night, the Pan-American Conference voted to adopt the declarations drafted at several secret meetings, namely the Declaration of Economic Cooperation, the Declaration of Neutrality, and the Panama Declaration (on the establishment of a continental sea around the Americas as a safety zone). The work of the conference was then concluded. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Panama City, Panama. The "Panama Declaration" adopted by the Pan-American Conference, namely the declaration on the establishment of a "continental sea" around the Americas as a safety zone, is about to be published. Observers from various neutral countries here stated that this declaration should include various provisions against submarines. In other words, American countries will henceforth prohibit warships, submarines, and even armed merchant ships of belligerent countries from entering the "continental sea" in order to ensure navigational safety. In addition, the declaration should also prohibit cargo ships from sending radio messages from American ports in order to avoid violating neutrality. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Britain and Japan to Reopen Negotiations on Tianjin Issue</h3>
<p>London. Regarding the issue of the British concession in Tianjin, China, well-informed sources here have announced that Britain and Japan may reopen talks in the near future to discuss solutions to local incidents. In other words, only the issues of concession administration and police affairs will be discussed. As for the financial policies that various countries are pursuing towards China, Japan will not put pressure on Britain. The British government will soon instruct its ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to reopen negotiations with the Japanese authorities. According to Japanese sources, the country's attitude towards all four countries is completely in line with the neutral policy recently announced by its government. Regarding this matter, certain observers believe that if Japan were to change its attitude, the United States would exert pressure on the country, which has already had a considerable impact.

<h3>Ambassador Guo Refutes Japanese Rumors</h3>
<p>London. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi, when interviewed by Reuters today, strongly denied the Japanese claim that China is in danger of being controlled by the Communists. He stated that this rumor is nothing more than propaganda aimed at confusing world public opinion about the true dispute between China and Japan and to give importance to the puppet regimes they intend to establish. The fundamental fact is that China has clearly been fighting for the survival of justice and freedom in the past two years, which is also what Britain and France are fighting for today.

<h3>Japanese Government Passes Establishment of Ministry of Trade</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Yesterday afternoon, the Cabinet met and approved the organization of the Ministry of Trade. Today, Prime Minister Abe entered the palace to report this matter to the Japanese Emperor. The new Ministry of Trade will begin operations at the beginning of next year, and all preparations will be made this year. The new ministry will unify commercial administration and promote foreign trade. The affairs handled by the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Foreign Exchange Bureau and the Maritime Affairs Section of the Ministry of Finance, the Silk Export Department and the Dairy Products Export Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Textile Bureau, Trade Bureau, and Chemicals Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Korean Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs will all be taken over by the new ministry. However, diplomatic negotiations related to commerce will still be handled by the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The newspapers here deeply believe that Abe's organization of the Ministry of Trade will be able to achieve success through harmonious compromise among the relevant ministries. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The Japanese government's plan to establish a new Ministry of Trade was passed by the Cabinet on the 3rd. According to financial circles, since the outbreak of the China Incident, Japan's trade institutions have gradually changed. At a time when the international situation is about to change, it is necessary to have an ideal organization to manage all trade affairs. The Ministry of Trade established this time is the organization to achieve this goal. However, it will take time for this organization to smoothly implement its tasks, so it is worth paying attention to how the authorities will investigate trade administration.

<h3>Difficulties Exporting Manchurian Soybeans</h3>
<p>Tokyo. According to Japanese sources in Changchun, exporters are finding it very difficult to transport soybeans by sea to Germany and Italy due to the European war. Therefore, they are currently inquiring with the Soviet government about the possibility of transporting soybeans to the Axis countries via the Siberian Railway. Soybeans are the main product of Manchukuo, and Germany and Italy are the largest buyers. Last year, Manchukuo exporters exported 23.909 million tons of soybeans and soybean cake, and 60,000 tons of soybean cake. This year, soybean exports decreased by 93,000 tons compared to the same period last year, and soybean oil exports decreased by 1,000 tons, but soybean cake exports increased by 226,000 tons.

<h3>US Army Orders New Tanks</h3>
<p>Washington. The US Army has ordered 329 new tanks, which will cost approximately $4.8 million. This is the first move by the US Army to accelerate the mechanization of its ground forces. In view of the rapid German offensive in Poland, the efficiency of tanks in modern warfare has been fully demonstrated. It is reported that these new tanks are all of the latest type and weigh approximately 12 tons each. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Ship Accident in Singapore Port</h3>
<p>Singapore. The Norwegian ship "Høegh" (4,114 tons) sank after hitting a mine while entering the port of Singapore today. All crew members have been rescued. According to an official statement, the ship entered a minefield without following any signals. Although patrol boats tried their best to stop it, they were unsuccessful. It is reported that the ship was sailing from Saigon to Mumbai. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>UK Parliament Discusses the Situation - Lloyd George Makes Remarks - Any Peace Agreement Should Be Considered Carefully - The House Denounces it as a Sign of Surrender</h3>
<p>London - After British Prime Minister Chamberlain firmly declared in the House of Commons today that Britain and France would not abandon their determination to wage war, key figures from various parties spoke one after another, largely welcoming this determination, even the opposition. Labour Party leader Attlee stated, "I agree with the Prime Minister that any peace agreement must be carefully studied, but we must face reality. Speaking of peace when there is no peace is of no help. Merely restoring the situation to what it was a year or two ago will not bring peace to the world. This war has been going on for a long time, not just since the formal declaration of war. What is needed now is action, not empty words, and then there can be peace. The international situation is still chaotic, and it is currently impossible to determine the impact of the German-Soviet agreement." Attlee mentioned reports from the Ministry of Information and broadcasts, saying that the people need more information and that they heard more in Churchill's broadcast speech. Attlee expressed appreciation for the contributions of the people of Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia to Britain, saying that the astonishing unity of the British Empire is the result of the free association of free people.</p>
<p>Liberal Party leader Sinclair said that while they urgently hope for peace, they are not prepared to sacrifice freedom and the moral values of civilization to purchase this peace, so they must continue to fight until Hitlerism in Germany is broken. Sinclair also reiterated his proposal to hold a non-public parliamentary meeting.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Lloyd George then took the floor, advising Parliament not to make hasty judgments, saying that if the entire situation regarding peace depended on Hitler's word, then he feared they would have no other choice but to continue until they had better and more stable guarantees. Judging from news reports and discussions during the Italian government's meeting with Hitler at his invitation, someone will now present detailed conditions to the British government for consideration. Generally speaking, the Italian government has expressed goodwill toward us. He believes that they should not make overly hasty judgments but should give it very careful consideration. This is very important. If they accept the conquest of Poland as a fait accompli and conclude a peace treaty based on this condition, it would be their shame. It is now clear that they will obtain many things far beyond this range, and there are several issues that they should consider, not only the Polish issue but also the Czech issue and the colonial issue. He believes that when the Prime Minister receives a proposal, he should consult with Parliament and hold a non-public meeting to discuss it. The fate of this war does not depend on Britain, France, and Germany, but on the neutral countries. Italy and the Soviet Union should both declare neutrality, and the United States is also a neutral country. Even if they are impartial, they are either our friends or our enemies. The United States, as a neutral country, can help us. They know this, and the United States also knows this. As for Italy and the Soviet Union, within the scope of neutrality, they can change the world between friendly and unfriendly neutral countries.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that in the current situation, holding a secret meeting of Parliament does not seem to have any special value. What they have heard so far regarding peace is only a suggestion or an indication that one will be made.</p>
<p>George said that he anticipated this proposal, but it may not come to pass.</p>
<p>Chamberlain said that if any proposal is put forward, the British government does not intend to reply hastily. He sees no reason why Parliament should not have a full opportunity to consider any proposals that may arise in the future and to hear the government's proposed response. He would welcome any proposal that can be genuinely considered to have achieved the war aims of the British government, as he has explained before, more eagerly than anyone else. But at this time, it would be too early to make any hopes for such a proposal to be put forward. Members of the House then discussed the possibility of a peace proposal appearing soon. Former First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper said that Lloyd George's proposal for a secret meeting of Parliament would likely be misunderstood in Europe as a sign of surrender, but Lloyd George certainly did not mean this. He fully supports Chamberlain's statement that "peace cannot be established with the current German government because the current German government will never abide by any peace it signs."</p>
<p>Lloyd George interjected, saying that he would never want to propose surrender. Labour Party member Grenfell and Conservative Party member Croft both spoke after George, criticizing George's inappropriate remarks. Independent Labour Party member Buchanan and Labour Party member Ballach, both known for their anti-war views, then spoke in favor of opening peace talks, saying that the issues currently in dispute are not worth sacrificing the lives of millions of people. Liberal Party member Morris Jones spoke, being very disrespectful of George's words, asking whether George would dare to make these remarks again in his Welsh constituency. Conservative Party member Keyser stood up and said that George's words were misunderstood, and even at this time, Prime Minister Chamberlain was still striving to seek a peace for Europe that could preserve civilization. Several Labour Party members then stood up to speak. Tinker advocated that the British government continue to fight until it obtains better conditions than are currently available, and Labour Party members Silverman and Cohen both advocated that Britain should state the conditions under which it could negotiate peace and make them public, and not give others the initiative.</p>
<p>In his speech, Prime Minister Chamberlain (referring to the Ministry of Information, said that as a result of reviewing the methods of disseminating news, it has now been decided to restore all the pre-war habits, with newspaper reporters directly contacting various government departments, each department having its own method of issuing news to journalists. As for the mechanical facilities in the Ministry of Information building for receiving and sending government news, there is no intention to abolish them. The new method will be implemented from Monday of next week. The inspection of materials submitted to newspapers will continue to be carried out by inspectors as usual. The government has now appointed Sir Monckton as the Chief Censor and will monitor the method of supplying news to newspapers. It is reported that Monckton is 48 years old and is a well-known figure in the legal profession. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>The "New York Times" reported that the intense emotion caused by Lloyd George's remarks in the British House of Commons yesterday, suggesting that German peace terms should be carefully considered, is further evidence that democracy is still working in Britain. Important events concerning Britain's war aims can still be questioned and answered as usual. It is not difficult to imagine what would happen if such events occurred in the German Reichstag or the Supreme Soviet. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>British Intelligence Department Activities in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to local political figures, several well-known British journalists who originally lived in Japan have now come here from England. It is said that they will establish a branch of the British Intelligence Department in Japan to engage in wartime propaganda. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union to Transport Timber to Britain</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - An evening newspaper reported that the Soviet Export Trade Shipping Company has chartered several ships from the Swedish Shipping Company to transport timber to Britain, but the relevant authorities here have not heard of this. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Poland Was Fooled by Britain and France - Berlin Claims to Have Evidence to Support This</h3>
<p>Berlin - The Polish ambassador to France denied that former Polish President Mościcki and General Śmigły-Rydz had several conversations with a prominent figure in a church in Romania. Authoritative sources here today revealed details of these conversations. Śmigły-Rydz said that he had decided to negotiate peace the day after the start of the war. The British told him that under no circumstances should he negotiate peace and promised to use the full strength of the British army, navy, and air force to assist Poland. It was also said that the British government had officially informed the Polish government that 1,500 British aircraft had departed for Poland, but Poland never saw the British aircraft arrive. British officials also assured the Polish government that two points of the German Siegfried Line had been breached and that French troops had penetrated deep into German territory. President Mościcki said that the German army did not use poison gas or drop poison gas bombs during this operation. People in Berlin stated that the prominent figure in the church who had spoken with Mościcki and Śmigły-Rydz belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church. It can be seen that although the Vatican's claim that no prominent figures in the Catholic Church had spoken with Mościcki and Śmigły-Rydz is true, it still cannot disprove the existence of this conversation.</p>
<p>Another report said that authoritative sources here also presented equally important news of a similar nature that a certain Polish diplomat had also revealed. This news, reported by Italian newspapers, was a report from Beijing. According to the report, Colonel Beck, a former Polish official, was also willing to consider Germany's proposal at the end of August, but because Colonel Śmigły-Rydz informed him that Britain had firmly assured Poland that the British Air Force would provide assistance to Poland, Beck did not say much. Later, Beck again asked Chamberlain to confirm this guarantee. Chamberlain still confirmed it, saying that the French Air Force would also be dispatched and would cooperate with the British Air Force to assist Poland. After the outbreak of hostilities, Chamberlain refused to send the air force to Poland. The facts are all there, and there is no need to say more. German authoritative sources solemnly declared that if anyone doubts our words, we can prove them in an appropriate way. All the data or arguments regarding the above-mentioned conversations are indeed in German hands. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Repeatedly Attack Guangzhou - Plainclothes Units Annihilate Thirty to Forty Japanese Soldiers - Japanese Fuel for Baiyun Airport Set Ablaze - Japanese Ammunition and Supplies at Shiwuitang Burned</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) - The situation in Guangzhou is becoming increasingly chaotic. Chinese guerrilla forces are rising up and active, and they have already achieved significant results. The Japanese army is finding it extremely difficult to cope. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In the past half month, the Japanese army in Guangdong has been actively strengthening its inner line of defense in Guangzhou because it has been suffering repeated defeats in the Northeast. In the past ten days, it has forcibly captured more than 2,000 strong young men in the city and driven them to the Guangzhou-Huaxian and Guangzhou-Conghua lines to build fortifications for them or forced them to serve as cannon fodder. Chinese guerrilla forces have also taken the opportunity to mix into the conscripted people and become active. On the morning of September 16, several dozen plainclothes members of a certain unit, disguised as civilians, were captured by the Japanese army in Xiguan and sent to Xicun to serve as coolies. That night, at 12 o'clock, taking advantage of the Japanese soldiers' sound sleep, they responded from within and without, and surrounded and annihilated more than 100 members of the Japanese Ando unit. The Japanese soldiers resisted desperately in a panic. After a fierce battle lasting more than an hour, thirty to forty Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and two Japanese barracks were burned down. The Chinese army seized more than ten rifles. The Chinese air force Shenying team has repeatedly conducted reconnaissance raids on the Japanese positions in Guangzhou recently. On the 18th, Chinese planes entered the city twice for reconnaissance. The first time was at around 11 a.m., with a total of eight aircraft, arranged in formation, entering the city from the Huangsha Railway Station. They dropped a large number of leaflets and slogans in the city center and the Henan area, and conducted reconnaissance over the Baiyun and Tianhe Japanese airfields in the northeastern suburbs of the city before leaving the city at 12 o'clock. The second time was at 2 p.m., with a total of three aircraft flying along the Guangzhou-Huaxian highway and circling over the city before retreating at 2:30 p.m. No bombs were dropped. The propaganda materials dropped by the Chinese planes that day were about the significance of the "September 18" anniversary and explained the National Government's determination to persist in the war of resistance, and stated that the Chinese army would soon launch a major counteroffensive. The people in the city were very excited to see this.</p>
<p>At around 11 p.m. on the night of the 19th, dense gunfire was suddenly heard in the northern suburbs, like a string of firecrackers. Local residents were alarmed when they heard the news and panicked. Near Niulangang, the sound of fire and explosions was heard one after another. The sounds stopped at around 3 a.m. After investigation, it was learned that Chinese guerrilla forces had attacked Baiyun Airport and burned the Japanese army's fuel depot, causing a major fire. It was found that the Japanese army had transported hundreds of cans of fuel oil on the 18th, which were all burned to ashes that night, resulting in a great loss. The Japanese army panicked as a result of this battle. On the 20th, it ordered martial law, and all traffic in the northeastern suburbs was cut off. That night, plainclothes members of a certain Chinese army unit suddenly appeared again near the Shuangshan Temple when the Japanese army's guard was relaxed. They rushed straight to the Guangzhou-Huaxian highway station at the foot of Guanyin Mountain. The Japanese army was caught by surprise and became even more panicked. Chinese guerrilla forces beheaded fifteen Japanese sentries along the way. Seeing more than a dozen transport vehicles parked at the station, they destroyed three of them, killing or wounding several Japanese drivers.</p>
<p>At around 4 a.m. on the 21st, the dare-to-die team of the Chinese army's Liang unit gathered to attack the Shiwuitang Railway Station on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway. Since the Japanese army in Guangzhou has been replenishing ammunition and supplies to the Sanshui area recently, a large number of military supplies were stored at the station. The Chinese army mixed into the platform through clever action. First, they killed four railway policemen with broadswords, and then set fire to two train cars full of military supplies. The flames blazed for a while. The Japanese army rushed out in a panic, but the Chinese army had already retreated towards Huadi. The Japanese army disturbed the area until dawn before regretfully returning to the team.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Chao-Shan Lose Contact - Japanese Troops in Chao-an Repeatedly Try to Break Through Without Success - The Middle Section of the Fuyang Railway Has Been Cut Off</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence - The Chinese army's Wu Qizhi unit recently advanced eastward from Jieyang Fengshun and recovered Fe'e Ridge and Zhugao Mountain, the northern suburbs of Chao'an City. Han Mountain Dongjin, across the river, was also recovered on September 19. As the troops advanced east along the dike, the vanguard of a certain brigade passed Raoping Longdu and bypassed the Jishuitou Pagoda. The local militias of Chao-Shan-Rao responded when they heard the news. On the 22nd, the Chenghai Zhanglin team recovered Chenghai City. The Chinese army on the front of the An-Jie Road captured Fuyang Station on the Chao-Shan Railway on the 23rd and then attacked the southern suburbs of Chao'an from Fengxi. The Chinese army in Longdu also crossed the river by bamboo raft and regained the Yunbu, Yinhu, and Han River tributary traffic on the levee highway, which was also cut off. On the 22nd, another 2,000 puppet troops from Shantou arrived, mostly from Wuxi and Yixing in Jiangsu, along with more than 2,000 Taiwanese troops, who were divided into more than 20 speedboats. One part went to Chao'an City to reinforce, and the other part went to Anbu to reinforce, carrying a large amount of ammunition and grain. That morning, the artillery battle outside the northwest gate of Chao City was very fierce. The Japanese army's position on Hulu Mountain was fought over with bayonets by both sides, with gains and losses decided several times. More than 300 Japanese recruits and five tanks rushed out of the west gate and headed straight for Fengxi on the An-Jie highway, hoping to relieve the siege of the northeast gate. Seeing that the Japanese army was coming too fiercely, the Chinese army retreated to the northwest mountainous area of Yunbu Terrace and fought fiercely with the Japanese army all day long. On the 23rd, the Chinese army on Zhugao Mountain and Bijia Mountain held their positions and did not retreat. The battle moved to the outskirts of Chao'an again. Fuyang was reoccupied by the Japanese army. At 2 a.m. on the 24th, taking advantage of the Japanese army's unsteady footing, the Chinese army attacked Yangyang from the side of Wuyang and recaptured Fuyang, Gezhou, and Yunbu, killing more than 50 Japanese soldiers. That afternoon, the artillery battle on the Yunbu side was extremely fierce. The Japanese army began to retreat towards Chao City at around 1 p.m. Traffic between Chao and Shan has been cut off to this day. The Japanese army from Shantou to Chao by water now has to move to Chenghai and does not dare to dock above the Xiangzi Bridge. On the 21st, the Chinese army sank seven or eight Japanese speedboats and rubber boats near Yixi. Later, the Japanese speedboats changed their berth near the Banana Garden in the South Gate, using the Anji Saint King Temple and the Chuncheng Building Station, and the Guandi Palace in the South Teaching Ground as military stations. Zhang Weichen's puppet maintenance association has also moved out of the city. On the 25th, the sound of artillery in Chao City moved to the southwest wilderness. The Chinese army team in Chenghai City automatically retreated to the Fengshan Henglong River surface to intercept the Japanese speedboats coming and going on the river. After the Japanese army in Anbu City was attacked by the Chinese army's Wu Shaowu team on the evening of the 20th (the Japanese army camp in a certain shrine in Dahebu was burned, and more than 110 Japanese soldiers died), they changed their encampment to the high ground outside the railway line, preferring to sleep in the open rather than occupy civilian houses. Above Anbu, such as Huamei, Caitang, Hechao Wuyang, Fuyang, and Fengxi, have all been recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Chao'an is trapped in the city, and water and land traffic have been cut off. There is no way to break through. The Chinese army is conducting operations to annihilate them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Xiamen Attempts to Issue Counterfeit Currency in Xiamen - The People Resolutely Refuse to Use It</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence - The Japanese army in Xiamen is actively planning to establish a Xiamen branch of the puppet Huaxing Bank and issue counterfeit currency in order to disrupt the finances of South China. For the past month, the Liaison Department of the Japanese Army's Asia Development Board in Xiamen has repeatedly summoned the section chiefs of the puppet municipal government, the committee members of the puppet municipal chamber of commerce, and various traitors in the city to discuss the establishment of a Xiamen branch of the Huaxing Bank. There was a lot of discussion at the first meeting, and no consensus could be reached. The economic minister of the liaison department, ××××, who attended the meeting, saw that the puppet mayor, Li Sixian, was hesitant and asked him about it. Li immediately expressed his opinion, saying that Xiamen is a small island, Gulangyu is dominated by foreign powers, and the mainland regime still belongs to the Kuomintang government. Even if we issue banknotes, they will only circulate on one island. Not only will we not make a profit, but we will also lose money. The minister then announced the adjournment of the meeting. Three or four days later, five-colored small slogans and announcements suddenly appeared successively in the streets and alleys of the city and in the villages and towns of Heshan, detailing the Japanese conspiracy to deceive and exchange legal tender and the worthlessness of counterfeit currency, and asking the people of Xiamen to refuse to use counterfeit banknotes. Four or five days later, slogans and leaflets of the Xiamen-He All Circles Refuse to Use Counterfeit Currency Grand Alliance flew all over the city. However, on August 18, the minister still did not give up and summoned the committee members of the puppet municipal chamber of commerce and traitors to a meeting to detail the situation of raising operating expenses, setting the amount at 170,000 yuan, which would be apportioned among the merchants. The traitors were shocked and jointly proposed to use the public property of the Tongshan Hall and the unreturned real estate as a discount. The minister was furious and rebuked them, and they dispersed in disappointment. That night, the Refuse to Use Counterfeit Currency Grand Alliance intensified its activities, and there were more slogans on the streets. However, the next day, ××××, the head of the Xiamen Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, issued a statement, saying that no matter how bad the environment, the "Huaxing" branch must be established, but the people's refusal to use counterfeit currency is very firm.</p>
<h3>Education News - Able-bodied Young Men Studying in Primary and Secondary Schools Will Not Be Granted Deferment - Various Wartime Training Classes in Various Provinces Should Be Submitted to the Ministry for Approval Based on Their Nature and Needs</h3>
<p>(Fangyan News) - The Military Control Zone Command recently interpreted five items of the revised Provisional Regulations for the Implementation of Military Service, which are very important to the future of military administration. The details are as follows: (1) Article 29 of the Revised Provisional Regulations for the Implementation of Military Service states that those who are still subject to mobilization and conscription into the camp for military service during wartime refer to the conscription specified in the Provisional Rules for Army Conscription. The meaning of the original text is very clear. The implementation of this conscription should still be carried out in accordance with the implementation of the national conscription and lottery in times of emergency. As for how to conscript and enlist those whose physical condition is not suitable for active service, it should be handled in accordance with the regulations at the time of implementation of the conscription. (2) What is the definition of the two words "director" in the phrase "director of official affairs"? The government has already sent a telegram to the Ministry of Military Affairs to explain it and ordered compliance. (3) Able-bodied young men studying in senior high schools, junior high schools, and primary schools will not be granted deferment in the future. As for the students receiving training in various wartime training classes in various provinces, they should be submitted to the ministry for approval based on their nature and needs. (4) Although the word "old age" is not noted by age in the revised regulations, judging from the general point of view and the principles of legislation, it should be determined by the fact that old age requires the maintenance of their children, and it can be handled according to the actual situation. (5) The revised parts of the Revised Provisional Regulations for the Implementation of Military Service should be implemented from the date of the order.</p>
<h3>Trends in Teacher Education in Various Countries (6) – Instrumentalist Approaches in Japan and Russia</h3>
<p>Some people compare Guizot of France with Mori Arinori of Japan because they both laid the foundation for national education in their respective countries. That is, they created a rigorous, complete, and compulsory teacher education system. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan's education system has been modeled after France. To this day, with the exception of the university district system, which was abolished early on, other aspects such as the teacher education districts and elementary education districts remain the same. Even the two national higher normal schools for men and women stand in distant, echoing opposition to each other. Therefore, Japanese teacher education is similar to that of France in form, but each has its own focus in spirit. The emperor-centric ideology in Japan was originally a call to overthrow the feudal clans, but it was able to establish its foundation and deeply penetrate the hearts of the people. Discerning individuals should recognize that the credit for this should be given to the elementary and secondary school teachers. Because they possess the spirit of missionaries, they are able to concentrate the people's centripetal force towards the emperor and link the emperor's connection to the people. They have already become political propagandists or active cells. In other words, they have transformed into tools of the state. As for the effects of teacher education in Soviet Russia, they have not yet been fully revealed, but it is precisely using role models of advanced workers of the branch labor movement and believers and practitioners of communism to mold its elementary and secondary school teachers. From the understanding and application of teacher education in Japan and Russia, they share similar views, which is to regard teacher education as a political tool.</p>
<p>(1) Japan: In 1886, Japan promulgated the Teacher Education Ordinance, dividing normal schools into ordinary and higher levels. It also mandated that each prefecture establish one school and declared the training objectives to be the three virtues of obedience, trust and love, and dignity and respect. Military training and management were used as means to achieve these goals. In 1887, the Teacher Education Ordinance was revised, removing the word "ordinary" from ordinary normal schools and allowing each prefecture to establish multiple schools. In 1907, the Regulations for Normal Schools were promulgated, with subsequent partial revisions. The current normal schools are divided into regular courses and specialized courses. The regular courses are further divided into Part 1 and Part 2. The admission qualification for Part 1 is the completion of the second year of higher elementary school, with an age of 14 or above, and the duration of study is five years. Part 2 requires a secondary school qualification, with graduates of secondary schools or those with equivalent academic qualifications studying for one year. However, women entering Part 2 study for one or two years. The specialized courses are for graduates of the regular courses of both Part 1 and Part 2, or those with equivalent academic qualifications, and the duration of study is also one year. The current system allows for the non-establishment of Part 2. In fact, Part 1 is the main body of the normal schools, so reformers debate whether Part 1 or Part 2 should be the main focus. The enrollment quota is based on the number of school-age children in the prefecture, as determined by the local governor. The graduates are granted elementary school teacher licenses by the local governor upon application by the school principal. The main points of their education are to make loyalty to the emperor and patriotism a necessary condition for teachers. Therefore, their daily life should clarify the great righteousness of loyalty and filial piety, and invigorate their ambition and integrity as citizens. Furthermore, cultivating the spirit, encouraging moral character, obeying rules, maintaining order, and developing habits of self-study are considered necessary qualities for teachers. Therefore, in the curriculum arrangement, the subject of moral cultivation is included every academic year, with an average of two hours of lectures per week. The subject of civics is only included in the fourth and fifth academic years.</p>
<p>The teachers of secondary education in Japan are in fact divided into what is known as the Meikei system and the Akamon system. Generally, the Meikei system is dominant in normal schools and higher elementary schools, while the Akamon system is dominant in general middle schools and high schools. The Meikei system refers to the Tokyo Higher Normal School, while the Akamon system refers to the Tokyo Imperial University. Because Japan established two higher normal schools for men and women to cultivate teachers for secondary schools, there is one higher normal school for men and one for women in Tokyo, and others are located in Hiroshima for men and Nara for women. Initially, in 1894, the Regulations for Higher Normal Schools were revised, dividing the schools into departments of literature and science, placing the natural history department in the science department, and setting the duration of study at four years. Although there have been changes since then, the basic structure remains the same. Currently, the higher normal schools, in addition to the departments of literature and science, also have a physical education department at the Tokyo Higher Normal School and an education department at the Hiroshima Higher Normal School. Furthermore, the Tokyo and Nara Women's Higher Normal Schools have a home economics department. In addition, there are specialized courses and elective courses. To enable graduates of general universities to obtain secondary school teacher qualifications, special research courses have been established. The Tokyo and Hiroshima Higher Normal Schools are further divided into four divisions in the Department of Literature: (1) Moral Education and Civics, (2) Japanese Language and Chinese Literature, (3) English, (4) Geography and History. The Department of Science is divided into three divisions: (1) Mathematics, (2) Physics and Chemistry, (3) Natural History. The Department of Physical Education is divided into Group A, which includes gymnastics and athletics, and Group B, which includes judo and kendo. The Department of Home Economics is also divided into two divisions: (1) Home Economics, (2) Sewing. The undergraduate course lasts four years and admits graduates of normal schools, middle schools, and higher girls' schools. Tuition is not charged, and graduates are obligated to serve for a certain period as designated by the Ministry of Education. In 1933, the Tokyo and Hiroshima Higher Normal Schools were upgraded to Universities of Literature and Science, but they retained their original Higher Normal Schools as affiliated institutions. This paved a new path for high school graduates to advance into the education field, and at the same time, it could expand the influence of the Higher Normal Schools to high schools and specialized schools. Because graduates of the Universities of Literature and Science can obtain not only general secondary school licenses but also high school and specialized school licenses. The entire secondary education system in Japan is almost entirely interconnected. The Higher Normal Schools monopolize the normal schools, and the normal schools monopolize the elementary schools. This kind of mechanism seems to turn elementary and secondary school teachers into grassroots active cells of emperor-centric ideology. Of course, there are also secondary school teachers who come from "certification" or "examination," but in the reality of the education field, they are probably as insignificant as a grain of millet in the vast ocean and do not occupy an important position at all.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Establishes Student Guidance Office in Kunming to Guide Students Arriving in Kunming from Various Regions</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 4th) In order to guide students and graduates coming from the occupied areas to Kunming to participate in the unified entrance examination and to further their studies or serve in the rear, the Ministry of Education established the Student Guidance Office in Kunming last month. Cha Liangzhao was appointed as the director, and Wu Chunwu was appointed as the deputy director. The office is responsible for taking care of student accommodation, guiding student life and thought, and assisting students in solving problems related to further studies or transfers. The office's main task recently is to register students who have lost their schooling in the occupied areas and high school graduates who have recently arrived from Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing and did not have time to participate in the university entrance examination. The office will send a letter to Southwest University requesting a special examination. It is said that the National Southwest Associated University will hold the examination soon.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Tightens After Initial Easing, US Dollar Reaches 8 Yuan in the Morning, Buying Spree Leads to Sudden Reversal</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the official HSBC exchange rates. The unofficial market for British and American currencies experienced dramatic fluctuations, with frequent ups and downs that were difficult to grasp. The overall situation shifted from weak to strong. Initially, there was selling pressure from Hong Kong and other locations via telegraph, and Western merchants like Sassoon and smaller Chinese and Western speculators also tended to sell. Although HSBC and Wah Hsing took the opportunity to buy, the trend continued to be downward. At one point, the British gold rate eased to 4 shillings and 75 pence, and the US dollar rate strengthened to 8 yuan. The British rate reached its lowest level since July 20th of this year, and the US dollar rate reached its highest level since breaking through the 8 yuan mark on August 5th. Later, rampant and unsubstantiated rumors spread in the market, including reports of improved relations between Britain and Japan and the resignation of a certain minister. In addition, Japanese silk factories had significant cotton settlement needs, and Chinese merchants also urgently shifted their focus to buying. The British bank HSBC also absorbed a large amount, so the situation immediately became tight. The lowest British gold rate was 4 shillings and 40.625 pence, and the US dollar rate was 7 yuan and 40.625 pence. At noon, the buying spree subsided slightly, and the rates returned to normal, closing at 4 shillings and a half and 7 yuan and 52.5 pence. As a result, the British rate was tighter and the US rate was looser than the previous day. The British rate tightened by 1.875 pence, and the US rate loosened by 0.25 pence, due to the increase of 1.375 pence in the exchange rate between the US and British currencies. As for the October futures, the trend was similar to the spot market, and trading was still active in the morning.</p>
<p>In the early morning, large orders from London drove up the short-term rate by 375 pence and the long-term rate by 4375 pence. New York silver prices rose by 25 points, and London gold prices remained unchanged. The exchange rates for British, American, and French currencies remained flat, while the exchange rate against Shanghai rose by 1.5625 pence. The US dollar rate rose by 1.375 pence against the British currency, increased by 10 cents against Shanghai, and rose by 1 cent against the French currency. The central bank's official exchange rates remained the same. In the morning, banks opened with spot selling prices of 4 shillings and 68.75 pence for British gold and 7 yuan and 87.5 pence for the US dollar, which was the same for the British rate and 0.0625 pence higher for the US rate compared to the previous close, due to the increase in the exchange rate. After the opening, a sudden selling order arrived from Hong Kong via telegraph, and Western merchants like Sassoon and smaller Chinese and Western speculators also followed suit, so the situation continued to loosen. It is estimated that foreign telegraphs and Chinese and Western speculators sold to HSBC, Wah Bi, Chase, certain foreign banks, and Chinese banks. The spot British gold rate rose from 4 shillings and 71.875 pence to 75 pence, and the spot US dollar rate strengthened from 7 yuan and 90.625 pence to 8 yuan. The HSBC official exchange rate remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be 1.5 fen higher. Afterwards, foreign banks became more willing to buy, and the Japanese bank Zhengjin also suddenly became active, so the market immediately softened. It is estimated that the Japanese bank and foreign banks, with the help of Chase, bought spot British gold from Chinese merchants and foreign banks at 4 shillings and 62.5 pence, softening it to 56.25 pence, and the spot US dollar rate loosened from 7 yuan and 87.5 pence to 62.5 pence. Later, selling orders arrived again from overseas via telegraph, and certain banks also expressed a strong intention to sell, so the market situation turned weak again. It is estimated that foreign banks absorbed spot British gold from foreign telegraphs and certain banks at 4 shillings and 62.5 pence and 65.625 pence, and spot US dollars at 7 yuan and 68.75 pence and 78.25 pence. At that time, rumors suddenly spread that a certain minister had resigned. In addition, Japanese silk factories had numerous cotton settlements, and Chinese merchants also urgently followed suit, and it was difficult for banks to sell, so the situation turned tight again. It is estimated that Japanese silk factories and Chinese merchants settled and sold spot British gold to foreign banks at 4 shillings and 56.25 pence, narrowing it to 40.625 pence, and spot US dollars tightened from 7 yuan and 68.75 pence to 40.625 pence. At noon, the situation was slightly calm. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 4 shillings and a half for British gold and 7 yuan and 56.25 pence for the US dollar. The British gold rate for the current month was 4 shillings and 43.75 pence, and the US dollar rate was 7 yuan and 43.75 pence. As a result, compared to the previous day's spot price, the British rate returned to a tight level by 1.875 pence, and the US rate loosened by 0.25 pence. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. The situation was slightly calmer, but the trend was still strong. The securities firms and certain money exchange firms resumed raising the price, opening at 4,045 yuan and raising it to 4,060 yuan. As a result, it closed at 4,058 yuan, an increase of 43 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still active in the morning, but turned light in the afternoon, with a total of about 1,200 taels. Gold jewelry stores raised their prices by 5 yuan accordingly. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>More Foreign Currencies Rise Than Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw most currencies rise except for the Hong Kong dollar, which continued to fall by 5 cents, and the Singapore dollar, which fell by 20 cents. British gold certificates rose by 80 cents following the exchange market. US dollar certificates once reached 13 yuan and 75 cents, but ended at 13 yuan and 65 cents, resulting in an increase of 35 cents. The British pound rose by 2 yuan and 50 cents, the US dollar pound rose by 1 yuan, the French franc certificate rose by 1 cent, and the Annam dollar and Philippine dollar certificates both rose by 10 cents. The Canadian dollar certificate rose by 30 cents, the Japanese yen certificate rose by 1 cent, and the Korean won certificate rose by 8 li. All other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Both British and American Silver Prices Rise, Indian Silver Falls Sharply</h3>
<p>(3rd, London) According to a telegram from London, the silver market was firm due to Indian purchases and speculator selling. After closing, it turned flat. Buyers were satisfied. Large silver bars, near term, rose by 375 points, and long term, rose by 4375 points. According to a New York silver telegram, US spot prices rose by 25 points. Also, according to a Bombay silver telegram, the Indian silver market was inclined to be weak. Both spot and futures prices fell sharply by 1 rupee and 8 annas.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Remains Steady, Call Loan Rate Marked Down by 0.02</h3>
<p>Yesterday's bill discount rate for exchange drafts was initially around 70 yuan per thousand, but it was unsustainable and fell to 67.5 yuan. It only rebounded in the afternoon, ending at 70 yuan, which was the same as the previous day's price. The call loan rate of the Money Dealers' Association was suddenly marked down by 0.02 to 0.18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cash Rebounds After Attempted Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot market for cash ingots fluctuated rapidly, rising and falling sharply. The market opened weak in the morning and then strengthened, entirely depending on the tightness or looseness of foreign exchange. Initially, the market was quite loose, and sentiment was weak. Certain money exchange firms aggressively sought to sell, and demand from guest merchants was sluggish, causing the market to open sharply lower at 3,970 yuan and then fall further to a low of 3,950 yuan. Then, sudden rumors spread in the market, including baseless reports of improved relations between Britain and Japan and the resignation of a certain minister. At the same time, foreign exchange also tightened sharply, causing sentiment to turn around. Securities firms and certain money exchange firms aggressively bought at the low, and certain gold firms also followed suit initially, but then exited to take profits. However, the market price once rose to a peak of 4,085 yuan. At noon, foreign exchange returned to a slightly flat level, so the price fell to 4,047 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market was closed, and the situation became slightly calmer, but the trend remained strong. Securities firms and certain money exchange firms resumed pushing up the price, opening at 4,045 yuan and raising it to 4,060 yuan. As a result, it closed at 4,058 yuan, an increase of 43 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still active in the morning, but turned slow in the afternoon, with a total of about 1,200 taels. Gold jewelry stores raised their prices by 5 yuan accordingly. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Ingots Rebound by 43 Yuan</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, the situation was quite weak. The exchange rate was loose and strong, and the buyers were waiting and hesitating. The price immediately dropped by 45 yuan, a certain money dealer sold 30 taels to the securities firm for 3,970 yuan. After opening, a certain money dealer still had a strong intention to sell. It was reduced by 20 yuan to sell to the same industry for 10 taels and the cash store sold 20 taels to the money dealer for 3,950 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the exchange rate had softened. A certain money exchange firm bought it hard on behalf of the customer, although the silver building gang came to sell, the position still felt insufficient for distribution, so the trend suddenly became firm and immediately returned to 80 yuan. The gold store bought 20 taels from the silver building gang, which became 4,030 yuan. Later, due to the sale of cash shops, the price was reduced to 4,015 yuan. The speculators suddenly came to absorb and raised it by 20 yuan, and the money exchange industry traded 30 taels, which was 4,035 yuan. Later, the exchange rate became weaker, and a certain gold store suddenly made a profit and exited, so it fell again, and the gold store traded 10 taels to each other for 4,000 yuan. Afterwards, there were rumors of a minister's resignation, and the exchange rate tightened sharply, and people's hearts rose. The securities gang and a certain money dealer rushed to make progress on behalf of their customers. For a while, sellers were quite scarce, and the price soared by 85 yuan. The gold store mutually traded 20 taels for 4,085 yuan. At noon, because the exchange rate was slightly firm, the price rose sharply by 38 yuan. The securities gang sold 30 taels to the money dealer, which was 4,047 yuan, as the midday market. In the afternoon, the situation was quite flat. The opening price was reduced by 20 yuan, and the gold store sold 10 taels to the money dealer, which was 4,045 yuan. Later, the securities gang and a certain money dealer successively absorbed more than 100 taels, raising it by 15 yuan. The money dealer made 10 taels to the gold store for 4,060 yuan. Then the money exchange industry mutually traded 10 taels for 4,058 yuan for the evening closing price. As a result, it rose 43 yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day rose and fell by 135 yuan. The selling price of the current gold brand of the cash store was 10 yuan higher than the current price, and the purchase was reduced by about 30 yuan. The current gold price is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there are few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Was Listed 5 Yuan Higher Yesterday</p>
<p>At the beginning, Datong Hang still suspended 405 yuan for each tael of jewelry gold, but at 11:08, it was listed 5 yuan higher. After that, there was no change. As a result, Datong Hang changed to suspend 410 yuan. The new industry is the same as the previous price, and the purchase must be reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds See Active Buying in the Morning, but are Thwarted by Rumors in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The securities spot market was in a hovering state yesterday. However, many in the market were optimistic, so the market price was easy to rise but difficult to fall. In the morning, continuing the previous day's rising momentum, it continued to rise. Grade C once rose to 46 yuan and 80 cents, and Grade A broke through the 54 yuan mark. The situation was excellent for a time, and buyers were quite active. There were many buying interests from the 20th issue. Yongkangtai, Yuanyuan, and other firms had considerable volume. Later, Runheng suddenly sold a large batch, about 300,000 or so, and the rising momentum was frustrated. However, the noon closing was still about half a yuan higher. In the afternoon, there were sudden rumors of the resignation of a certain minister, and the selling sentiment in the market turned strong, and the market price fell by about half a yuan. Later, the 20th and 38th issues still had buying interest, so they were able to rebound slightly. As a result, they fell by a slight 5 cents to 20 cents. Only Grade E was good for 10 cents, and 96 was also good for 15 cents. The total turnover was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 150 shares of China Merchants Electric Power were traded at a price of 5 yuan and 31 cents.</p>
<p>Also, the Public Industry Association reported that the only feature of yesterday's stock market was the silent rise of Rui Rong shares and its rare phoenix-like transaction. At the close, buyers were bidding 11 yuan and 50 cents, and sellers were demanding 11 yuan and 70 cents. Yesong United Shipyard shares also soared to 145 yuan and a half. China Reclamation shares were slightly weak. Other stocks saw little change.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers: Current Sales Hopeless, Cotton Yarn Once Plunged</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to trend downwards, but most people in the market held an optimistic view, and there were quite a few who were willing to speculate and buy, so the market dynamics were unstable, rising and falling suddenly, which was very inconsistent. The result was still a decline, which was really due to the weakness of current sales. Hong Kong's exchange control was strict, and silver funds could not be remitted at will, which greatly affected procurement in South China. However, operators in this port were very enthusiastic, so the situation presented a hesitant appearance. However, during the period of falling prices, buyer activity was particularly intense, so as soon as good news was encountered, the false momentum disappeared. Currently, from the perspective of its trend, it is feared that it will not be easy to rise sharply for a while.</p>
<p>The opening of current yarn this morning was very discouraging, because current sales were hopeless, and the industry also held a wait-and-see attitude. The opening price fell by eighteen yuan, and the spot price of 20-count "Changing Horse" yarn was 750 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 728 yuan. However, after the decline, it triggered the activity of short covering, and everyone rushed to buy, and the market slightly rebounded. Near the close, buyers suddenly crowded in, and it was rumored that a certain minister had resigned, and a surge suddenly rose, jumping ten yuan. According to statistics, the turnover in half a day was 980 bales. Yesterday, British factories opened 2,650 bales of 20-count "Five Blessings," "Shepherd," "Three Stars," and other yarns. The total turnover for two days was 3,630 bales. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell by six yuan, "Heavenly Maiden" did not move, "Double Globe" fell by six yuan. Hong Tong Factory opened 100 bales of 10-count "New Solid Yi," with a price of 612 yuan. An Da Factory opened 600 bales of 10-count "Flying Tiger," with prices ranging from 585 yuan to 590 yuan. Today, there were 2,045 pieces exported to Tianjin, and another 20 pieces exported to Yantai. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland: 160, Fellow Traders: 685</p>
<p>Ningbo: 35, Yunnan: 100</p>
<p>Total: 980</p>
<p>Another report: Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions. This morning, due to the long exchange period, the trading intentions among the industry were quite weak, so the market transactions were very quiet. In the afternoon, the exchange rate suddenly tightened again, and transactions were slightly looser. There were also many inquiries from all parties, although there were not many actual transactions. The selling price of West Indian cotton was 180 yuan, "White Lock" was 170 yuan, and "Pingguoer" was 136 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: New York cotton market was weak from the beginning of the morning. News from Liverpool was bad, falling by 35 pound tones. Later, due to the weakness of the stock market and the active selling by Southern merchants, the closing price fell by more than 10 pound tones compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose slightly by more than 2 rupees, the Egyptian cotton market fell by 670 pound tones, and Liverpool fell by 8 pence.</p>
<h3>Grain: Arriving in a Rush, Japonica Rice Declines, Wuhu Indica Rice Continues to Be Sold Off by Japanese Merchants, Prices Slightly Lowered Again, Only Lushan Indica Rice is in Short Supply and Rises by Six or Seven Corners</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of national rice in wheelbarrow packages was relatively strong, with four or five thousand packages. People's hearts were more and more uncertain, and there were few visitors from the hometown. Transactions were sluggish, so the opening situation in the early market was weak. Those who had a lot of goods on hand sought to sell them quickly, and everyone lowered prices to attract buyers. The market for all goods was downstream all the way, and there was no big demand even until the livestock market. The downward trend became more and more intense, and each japonica rice fell by about two yuan, and new japonica rice also fell by one yuan to one and a half yuan. "Kejian" rice fell by more than one yuan, while "Yangjian" rice was slightly depreciated by half a yuan because it was easier to sell. "Dulujian" rice was quite popular due to its shortage, rising by six or seven corners each. It is estimated that special regular japonica rice is 42 yuan, medium is 40 yuan, special tin japonica rice is 41 yuan, high is 40 yuan, medium is 39 yuan. Su Tong Kun japonica rice is priced at 10 yuan to 39 yuan, new japonica rice is 37.5 yuan to 38 yuan, Fengjing Baige is 39 yuan, early rice is 36 yuan, Yangjian is 28 yuan, settled at 25 yuan, Lujian is 28.3 yuan, settled at 27.5 yuan, Jiangbei new rice is 22.2 yuan, settled at 21.8 yuan, Wuhu rice is 22.6 yuan, settled at 21.5 yuan, Yu rice is 21 yuan, variable yuan is also small yuan pu, opening at 334 yuan. It is estimated that the total turnover in the city is more than 4,000 packages.</p>
<p>Another report: After the slightly rebounded a few days ago, goods sellers took the opportunity to spit it out again, and the Wuhu indica rice patented by Japanese merchants continued to be sold off in batches. Although indica rice is welcomed by middle and lower-class food households due to its low price, the countryside and villages also exchange indica rice for japonica rice, and sales are particularly strong. The low price of 212 yuan could have been stabilized, but because the inventory is the most abundant and the number of arrivals is high, there are still three or four thousand packages arriving by wheelbarrow yesterday, and there are also warehouse goods in the Hongkou district seeking to be sold off. Therefore, the high and medium grades continued to be lowered by three, five, or seven corners.</p>
<h3>Loss Fee Still Being Sorted Out, Reclaimed Flour's Downward Trend Slightly Abates</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's flour market was mediocre and without any special features. The plates of the No. 2 flour mill still stood at the original price of 7 yuan, and the downward trend of the reclaimed goods market also slightly subsided. This is because the sales of the Nanyang gang have been quite active recently, and there have been repeated shipments to Hong Kong, Xiamen, and other places. It is also said that the incident of Fuxin Factory collecting loss fees is being sorted out, so people's hearts are becoming more stable. Yesterday, the retail transactions in the Japanese street were as usual. The Beiyang gang paid attention to the by-product flour, and the sales of No. 2 flour were mediocre. The "Battleship" brand presented a situation of being rejected. The opening price of "Red and Blue Car Cannon" was 6.85 yuan, and the opening price of "Red and Blue Fuxin" was 6.83 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be more than 30,000 packages.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the source of wheat arrived but not much, because the production price has not been relaxed and cheapened, and the owners' intention to sell is still firm. However, the sales market is still lacking in development, and the market temporarily has no power to advance. The city only purchased five carts from hoarding households. Fufu and Liang factories purchased 1,600 packages, and the prices were both flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Flannelette is in Season, Transactions are Booming</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, affected by the fall in the price of cotton yarn in Dongpi, people's hearts were slightly soft, and new transactions in Guangdong and Hong Kong showed a wait-and-see attitude. Dyeing factories and Sui offices purchased grey cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill, and transactions suddenly became clear. The market was very chaotic, falling by one corner to two and a half corners per piece. However, coarse cloth and flannelette were still firm and expensive because the sales markets in this street and inland gangs were lively. Due to the increased bleaching and dyeing fees, the price of grey cloth that was bleached and dyed slightly fell, but the opening price was still flat. This street and hoarding corpses traded more than 1,000 packages of coarse cloth and coarse twill. The wholesale shops at the storefronts were busy with adding flannelette goods to sell. 7,000 to 8,000 pieces of lining flannelette, twill flannelette, and patterned flannelette were sold. Subei Taizhou and other places purchased 50 packages of fine cloth and coarse cloth, and more than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Yunnan gang purchased more than 30 boxes of crepe and woolen cloth, and more than 2,000 pieces of colored cloth and printed satin goods. New transactions in Guangdong and Yongbang were slightly clearer, and ordering and shipping were still extremely crowded.</p>
<p>East Piece Goods</p>
<p>White goods were all trending downwards yesterday due to sluggish customer sales. Fine cloth and fine twill continued to drop by 2.5 to 5 corners per piece. The leading fine cloth in the morning market fell to 22 yuan, and the market was slightly higher in the afternoon, but the transaction was sparse. The dyed sales and industry traders in the entire Japanese street were only dealing with 500 to 600 pieces.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>On the 5th, 21 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai, and 871 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar Has Arrived in Shanghai, Foreign Sugar Transactions Turn Prosperous</h3>
<p>According to the Dutch telegram, the price of raw white sugar that is being loaded is up to 9.70 Dutch guilders. Hong Kong telegram says that the set price of "B" Mark "Car White" sugar is 15.75 Hong Kong dollars. The association's plate was initially flat and then tight, and the situation was better. Transactions have also increased. The spot price of "24 Raw White" sugar is 54 yuan in this warehouse and 52.5 yuan in other warehouses, later reaching 54 yuan, with a total turnover of 7800 packages. Transit goods are at a small discount of four corners, and 400 packages were traded at 40.6 yuan. The price of "Taigu Car White" B Mark East Warehouse is still 57.8 yuan, and the West Warehouse was initially 58 yuan, then rose to 8 yuan and a half, with a total turnover of 1,200 packages. The remaining marks are refunded as usual. "H" Mark "Jun Chi" is 42.7 yuan, up one yuan, Dutch Red is 43.5 yuan, up five corners. Local cotton white sugar is up one yuan, No. 1 is 55 yuan, No. 2 is 54.5 yuan, No. 3 is 54 yuan, and No. 4 is 53.5 yuan. Local ice sugar is up by the same degree, No. 1 is 66.5 yuan, and "Jingming" ice sugar is 68 yuan. A total of 6,000 to 7,000 packages of local Xinghua red and white "Mountain God Guang Yongli" etc. have been shipped and are being reported. The number of plates will inevitably be slightly loose, and there will be a formal market soon.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Dried Scallops and Mussels See Sharp Rise</h3>
<p>Dried Scallops: Due to the scarcity of sources and the strong sales, the market situation has risen sharply. Recently, Ningbo goods are sold at 40 yuan, an increase of 56 yuan compared to before. Zhoushan goods are even rarer, at 80 yuan, and Yantai goods are 75 yuan, an increase of more than 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Mussels: Also due to the lack of arrivals, the current market price for small mussels is 170 yuan, and for those from Shangzhuang is 200 yuan. If they are slightly larger, three or four "gong" already require 220 yuan, an increase of about 560 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hainan Longan Rises by 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Hainan Longan: Recently, due to the limited number of arrivals, the market situation has tightened again. Yesterday, the number of plates for high-quality goods opened at 128 yuan, which is nearly 10 yuan higher than before. There are still some guest goods in the guarding. If there are no more arrivals in the later market, it is still expected to tighten again.</p>
<h3>Hardware: White Lead Wire Prices Rise Late and Sales are Stagnant</h3>
<p>The white lead wire market is gradually improving along with the new lead wire. Local manufacturers have no interest in buying and foreign merchants rarely inquire, so the market is very clear. However, due to the high cost of arrivals, the industry holders of this product are asking for prices that are more than 34 yuan higher than before. For example, No. 1 to No. 6 are sold at 40 yuan per load, No. 7 to No. 10 are priced at 42 yuan, No. 12 to No. 16 are priced at 45 yuan, No. 17 is 46 yuan, No. 18 is 48 yuan, No. 19 is 49 yuan, and No. 20 is priced at 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Haifeng White Coal is Forcibly Calming</h3>
<p>Since Hongji's price drop a few days ago, people's hearts and market sentiment have declined, leading to a standstill in transactions. Buyers are all watching. However, Haifeng white coal, which is used by restaurants and stoves, has to be forcibly calmed because the sellers have thrown out too many empty bills of lading. It is heard that the storefronts send customers every ton at 140 yuan, and every basket at 17.5 yuan, adding car force to customers as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Transactions are Light, Cotton Prices are Difficult to Loosen</h3>
<p>The transaction of current cotton has slightly reduced in color. The purchasing appetite of factories is not as fresh as it was the previous day, and only Shenxin and Xinsheng factories purchased a little. Other factories did not do much. The buying and selling between fellow traders is also light. Cotton prices still cannot be loosened, because the selling price of seed cotton in the countryside is already high, transportation on the road is difficult, and donations and taxes are heavy, which increases the cost of transportation merchants. Therefore, the situation is still firm. There were no arrivals from Subei in the morning, and 1,300 packages arrived in Shanghai in the afternoon. 600 packages arrived in Changyinsha in the morning and 1,500 packages in the afternoon. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>British Merchant Ships on the Far East Route Have Been Ordered to be Equipped with Weapons, Queen Ships Have Been Equipped, Each Ship is Equipped with Giant Guns and Anti-Aircraft Guns, British Navy Issued a Ban on Merchant Ships, Singapore Has Implemented Inspection</h3>
<p>In addition to the strict protection of the ships by the Far East Fleet, the British merchant ships sailing on the Far East route are also implementing an armed merchant ship policy, prohibiting the public from announcing the sailing dates of the ships and issuing a ban on merchant ships sailing at sea. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Implementing Armed Merchant Ship Policy</p>
<p>British merchant ships sailing on the Far East route, such as Changxing, Taikoo, and Jardine Matheson, etc., after being ordered to implement the armed merchant ship policy, today the Queen, Asia Queen, Canada Queen, and other ships have been fully equipped. Each ship is equipped with two anti-aircraft guns and two giant guns. The armament of each ship is installed in London and other places. The gun positions are usually hidden and not easily exposed unless necessary. The Singapore Naval Dockyard has been ordered to undertake the armed equipment of each merchant ship. As for the smaller Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships sailing along the Chinese coast, they have not yet had this kind of armament preparation. The purpose of the installation is to protect the safety of navigation in peacetime, and to provide the government with micro-use in necessary times, and to undertake military transportation.</p>
<p>Issuing a Ban on Merchant Ships Sailing</p>
<p>The British Navy issued a ban on merchant ships, (1) Without the order of the chief officer, no wireless electricity shall be sent, no reply shall be made to any report, no report shall be sent by wireless electricity, and no report shall be made by wireless electricity to foreign war personnel about the dangers of water mines or other defenses, but wireless electric warnings may be sent if the safety is enforced; (2) All British merchant ships, when at sea, must reduce or dim the navigation lights at night, extinguish all lights inside the ship, and try to reach the port at dawn, and avoid approaching armed areas at sea; (3) From September 5, all ships must not pass through the east and west banks of the Gambia River. The above-mentioned ban has been notified to the licenses of all British merchant ships by the Straits Settlements Shipping Office.</p>
<p>Singapore Inspects Incoming Ships</p>
<p>Singapore has implemented the inspection of incoming ships, and the methods are as follows: (1) All incoming ships that want to enter the port of Singapore must first sail to the Kusu Island Inspection Office to moor, and can only enter the pilot after being inspected; (2) From today, the pilot system will be implemented for those entering or leaving the harbor, and the pilot launch will be stationed near Kusu Island; (3) All ships that want to enter the wave-breaking dike must first sail to the inspection office. After the goods are unloaded, they must sail from Sitang Xinji to the west to the south, and then pass through the Great Island (4) Before the ship arrives at the inspection office, the special flag must continue to be flown. The inspection ship is blue, with a special inspection flag hanging high on the bow. At night, three white lights are hung high on the ship, each about six feet apart. This inspection is to prevent the entry of enemy spies and dangerous goods into the area.</p>
<p>British and French Cruise Ships Postponed to Shanghai</p>
<p>The schedule of ships is most accurate with postal ships. Except for accidents that are beyond human control, there is no delay at any time. However, recently, due to the impact of the European War, the voyage schedules of postal ships of the belligerent countries have also been inaccurate. In addition, because each company strictly keeps the import and export schedules secret, the outside world is unusually isolated. Here is the recent postal ship dynamics record. The Russian Queen of Changxing Company decided to come to Shanghai from Vancouver. According to the schedule, it should have arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month and sailed to Nanyang on the 3rd. It only arrived yesterday morning and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. It is scheduled to set sail from today to Hong Kong and Xiaoluson. The French Postal Ship Company's Felix Roussel postal ship should have arrived in Shanghai on the 29th of last month. The scheduled change is today to import, also stopped at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. It is said that the ship will not go to Japan this time, but will stay in Shanghai for a few days and return to Europe on the 10th. The new postal ship of the Dutch Java Postal Ship Company, Zhizhayun Jia, has an accurate schedule. The third decision to come to Shanghai arrived the day before yesterday (2nd) and is now moored at the 13th and 14th pontoons to load goods. It is scheduled to set sail this afternoon and return to Java.</p>
<h3>Japanese Radio Station Disrupts American Broadcasting</h3>
<p>Dalu News reported that yesterday (3rd), according to foreign residents who are equipped with wireless electricity in this port, a new Japanese radio station was established, broadcasting news in English for the past two nights, completely disrupting the news broadcast by the United States from San Francisco Baodao. The call signs of the Japanese radio station are JZK and JZJ. When the United States began broadcasting news to the East, it began broadcasting at the same time, and its radio waves were the same as the radio waves legally maintained by the San Francisco American General Electric Company, so that Shanghai could not receive the American news broadcast. The Japanese radio station also interfered with the news broadcasts transmitted from London via Hong Kong. American residents in Shanghai who like to receive American news broadcasts from San Francisco are now urging the American Consul General in Shanghai to pay attention to the Japanese radio station and immediately write to Ms. Smith, the American trade commissioner. Before yesterday evening, Ms. Smith had prepared an official detailed report and sent it to Washington, urging the relevant American authorities to pay attention to this matter.</p>
<p>The Huajun is Active on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, the Longtan Railway Track is Bombed, Locomotives and Freight Cars are Overturned and Traffic is Interrupted, and the Japanese Army Suffered Another Terrible Defeat in the Yangshuyuan Area</p>
<p>Due to the activity of the Huafang guerrillas along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, the railway track was destroyed twice and vehicles overturned last month. It is reported that near Longtan Station on the 2nd of this month, another freight car was bombed and derailed, causing traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai road to be blocked again. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Longtan Railway Track is Bombed</p>
<p>On the 12th of last month, the railway track between Xinfeng and Zhaze was destroyed. Following that, on the evening of the 28th, the Huafang guerrillas installed anti-mines between Henglin and Qishuyan, causing a train full of military cargo to overturn. The Japanese also confirmed these two incidents, but did not announce the extent of the losses. Yesterday, it was reported that on the morning of the 2nd, a freight car departing from Nanjing was traveling near Longtan Station when the railway track was suddenly bombed, causing the locomotive coal water car and three freight cars loaded with wheat to overturn at a small bridge near the site. As a result, passenger cars between Nanjing and Shanghai and Japanese military supply cars were again blocked on the day. Although the Japanese tried to repair it, they were temporarily unable to restore traffic due to engineering reasons.</p>
<p>Japanese Army was Annihilated in Yangshuyuan Town, the Japanese Army realized that there were occasional accidents along the line, and after the Henglin vehicles derailed, they tried to investigate all the clues of the landmine, and then sent a team to search the area south of the canal. On the 27th, they met the Huajun Self-Defense Regiment near Hutai in Wuxi County, and opened fire for two hours. The Japanese army immediately retreated because they were outnumbered. On the 30th, 30 or 40 Japanese troops from Luoshe took a ship to Yangshuyuan Town to search. The matter was learned by Zhou Hanliang, the special task force of the West District of the Huajun Self-Defense Regiment, and immediately led his troops, Xu Meichu and others, to meet them and opened fire at the Shao of North Street. The Japanese army was caught off guard. As a result, a Japanese small ship was sunk, 20 Japanese soldiers were killed, 5 were captured, and the rest were injured. The next day, the town was set on fire by the Japanese army and several houses were burned down.</p>
<p>Attempting to Entice the People to Protect the Road</p>
<p>According to reports from the Dakwangshe reporter yesterday who inquired about the transportation industry, the Japanese are quite anxious because the Nanjing-Shanghai transportation is often damaged, so they set up a so-called "Road Loving Class" by the "Huajun Railway Company", with a Japanese named Inamoto as the head of the class, trying to persuade residents along the line to jointly maintain the railway, and at 7:12 a.m. the day before yesterday, a special car was sent from the North Station, full of a large number of daily necessities, and Inamoto was in charge of directing the train to sell various items at low prices at stations along the line, taking the opportunity to promote to the people and persuade them to jointly maintain railway traffic, and report to the stations at any time if they find someone destroying it. However, the general public knows the righteousness, and most of them despise the Japanese move, and they only see the Japanese's hard work and failure.</p>
<h3>Armed Japanese Students Were Blocked from Passing Through the French Defense Zone, Stalemate for Two Hours, French Army Did Not Accommodate, Then Allowed to Pass by the British Army to Return to School</h3>
<p>The English Damei Evening News reported that 100 Japanese students from the Dōbun Shoin, each carrying a rifle, departed from the school building on Haig Road on Sunday in a parade and headed towards the Hongqiao Golf Club area. Without permission, they passed through the British military defense zone on their own. When they returned to school, they attempted to pass through the French military defense zone, but the French army did not allow it, because they had not obtained permission either. These students waited outside the French military defense zone for two hours, and finally the British army came out to mediate and escorted the Japanese army through the British military defense zone to return. However, they were prohibited from passing through the British military defense zone again in a military parade. Japanese newspapers in this port today criticized the French side for summoning two armored vehicles and machine gun teams. The school building of Jiaotong University in the Dōbun Shoin was destroyed in 1937 when the Chinese army retreated, so the school building is now located there. Although the Dōbun Shoin school building is outside the boundary road, it is actually outside the British military defense zone and the original French military defense zone. However, Japanese newspapers criticized the French army for "not effectively defending the school building in 1937." The Japanese students paraded in a military parade on Haig Road and Lujiazai Road on Sunday. Although Japanese newspapers said that the students were not carrying military equipment, they were actually carrying rifles. Although these people did not ask the British authorities for permission to pass in a parade, the British army still allowed them to exit the defense zone. On the way back, the Japanese students attempted to pass through the area taken over by the French army after the Chinese army withdrew in 1937 and return to school via Hongqiao Road. The French sentries did not allow them to enter the country, because they had not obtained a parade</p>
<p>Pass Permit</p>
<p>Also, the Japanese students did not attempt to return to the original route through the British military defense zone, the French army then asked them to leave their weapons behind before granting permission, but the Japanese students refused to comply. After a long stalemate, following the advice of the British army officer, they returned to school via the British military defense zone. The British military commander of Shanghai, Major General Simons, then received a thank you from the Japanese military commander of the area.</p>
<h3>The Puppet "Unified Tax Bureau" is Scheduled to be Handed Over on Double Ten Festival</h3>
<p>Shao Shijun, the "Director" of the "Unified Tax Bureau of the Three Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui" under Japanese control, has accumulated a lot of wealth since taking office. The puppet "Vichy Government" has repeatedly thought of getting its hands on this lucrative position, but to no avail. It has recently been learned that the "Bureau" will be handed over to the jurisdiction of the "Vichy Government" on the Double Ten Festival. It is said that the Nanjing puppet organization has sent puppet officials from Nanjing by car to Shanghai to handle the handover matters.</p>
<h3>American Asiatic Fleet Commander Hord Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, McReynolds Plans a Formal Banquet to Welcome Him, Plans to Visit the South China Sea for Inspection in Mid-November</h3>
<p>The flagship of the American Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, bearing the three-star admiral's flag, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 4th) at 3:00 PM from Qingdao. It is anchored in the river near the new Customs Wharf and plans to stay in Shanghai for a month. In mid-November, it will proceed to the South China Sea for its customary winter inspection. After Admiral Hord arrived in Shanghai, he has not yet visited the American Consul General Gauss, nor has he received any guests. However, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, the McReynolds Detachment, has scheduled a grand banquet at the French Club on the 12th of this month to welcome Admiral Hord and his staff. The McReynolds Detachment is also preparing for a parade in the Racecourse, to be inspected by Admiral Hord. At that time, senior American officials stationed in Shanghai, as well as foreign military officers and commanders stationed in Shanghai, may be invited to observe the parade. As for the foreign warships outside the Huangpu River, since the successive departures of the American warship Marblehead, and the British warships Grasshopper and Dragonfly, they have become sparse. Yesterday, due to the arrival of the flagship Augusta, the scene became spectacular again.</p>
<p>Adopting Active Measures Hereafter</p>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, an officer of the American Asiatic Fleet stated this morning (the 4th) that the American authorities are now adopting more forceful methods than those announced earlier this week. In the future, no information about the movements of American warships in the Far East will be disclosed. This latest order also applies to the wives of naval personnel, who will only be notified when the warships actually arrive. Regarding the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Qingdao at 3:00 PM this afternoon, no changes have been announced. However, whether the Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hord, arrived in Shanghai aboard the Augusta, or remained on his private yacht, the Isabel, could not be ascertained due to the latest order announced this morning, as the authorities have not released the Isabel's planned itinerary.</p>

<h3>Philipps Denies Continued Negotiations with the Puppet Regime, News in Japanese Newspaper Completely Groundless, Shanghai Municipal Council Declares It Will Not Relinquish Rights, Japanese Puppets Occupy More Houses</h3>
<p>Negotiations regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries of the Settlement have recently been conducted by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the British Defense Forces authorities, the Japanese side, and the puppet municipal government. Due to a major point of contention, the military authorities are unwilling to concede, causing the negotiations to become deadlocked. Meanwhile, the actions of the Japanese puppet regime in Western Shanghai are becoming increasingly bizarre. After setting up numerous puppet police stations, encroaching on police posts, and managing traffic, many houses were occupied yesterday, causing panic among nearby residents. Many have been considering moving away as the best option, posing a hidden threat to the Settlement issue. How this will develop in the future is difficult to predict. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council made a solemn statement yesterday: (1) it will not relinquish its rights to road construction beyond the boundaries of the Settlement; (2) it will not recognize any actions taken by the puppet regime in that area. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Authorities Determined Not to Relinquish Rights</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated on the 4th, "The Shanghai Municipal Council has no intention of relinquishing its rights to road construction beyond the boundaries of the Settlement. Although the facts show that the [Japanese] side and the puppet police are indeed challenging these rights, the Council is still in negotiations with the Japanese puppet regime, but these are currently deadlocked. The stationing of puppet police along the roads beyond the boundaries of the Settlement and the requirement that residents of the area pay house taxes to the puppet municipal government will not be recognized by the Shanghai Municipal Council." A reporter from the Datong News Agency also learned from reliable sources that this issue will soon be closely discussed by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the leaders of the defense forces of various countries within the Public Settlement. However, all parties involved have maintained a firm silence, so the details could not be disclosed.</p>
<p>Philip Has Not Met Recently</p>
<p>A Western newspaper reporter visited Philip, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, yesterday to inquire about the progress of negotiations regarding road construction beyond the boundaries of the Settlement. Philip refuted the Japanese spokesperson's claim that Philip had recently met with the puppet mayor, Chuan Xiao'an. Philip stated, "We met in the city center a month ago. Since then, we have not met. What the Japanese spokesperson is referring to may be the event a month ago." When asked about the Japanese side's request for the Shanghai Municipal Council to allow them to lease the slaughterhouse on Zhaoqin Road, Philip said, "This case must be decided after discussion by the Board of Directors. The content of the Japanese request cannot be disclosed at this time. However, this matter is very important because most of the meat supply for the Settlement comes from that slaughterhouse." The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury also reported that Philip, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, refuted the remarks made recently by a Japanese spokesperson at a press conference this morning (the 4th). According to Philip's statement to reporters, since he and Mayor Chuan Xiao'an met in the city center a month ago, no further meetings have been held. The Japanese spokesperson may be referring to the meeting held a month ago. Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council receiving an application from certain private Japanese parties to lease the Shanghai Municipal Council slaughterhouse on Zhaoqin Road, Philip stated that this matter must be submitted for discussion at the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting. The details of the Japanese application could not be disclosed this morning, but Philip considered this matter to be quite important at present because most of the meat supplied to the Public Settlement comes from this slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>Puppet Consolidated Tax Bureau Established in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>Number 11, Jessfield Road, was originally the clubhouse of the Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company. After the "August 13th" Incident, the Cilian Relief Society established the 31st Refugee Shelter there. Since it was occupied by the Japanese puppet regime on the 9th of last month, no incidents had occurred, except for the transfer of a portion of the building for the use of the Japanese puppet regime. However, yesterday, the shelter suddenly received a notice from the landlord, stating that the building had been leased to a puppet organization to set up a Consolidated Tax Bureau and that they were required to vacate the entire building within three days. Upon hearing this news, the refugees were filled with sorrow, but there was no way to reverse the situation, and they could only lament their helplessness.</p>
<p>Western-Style Residence Occupied Yesterday</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, more than a hundred Japanese military police and puppet police, traveling in trucks, arrived at Number 99, Jessfield Road (west of Connaught Road), and occupied the residence, evicting all the residents. However, the 33rd Refugee Shelter of the Cilian Relief Society, which was attached to the building, was not interfered with. Yesterday, approximately twenty more Japanese military police and puppet police were added. Currently, four military police are guarding the main gate, and a side gate has been opened for refugees to enter and exit. It has been verified that the building is a Western-style residence located diagonally opposite the Western District Command of the Japanese military police, with a large square inside.</p>
<p>Special Service Team, Third Brigade Established</p>
<p>Number 1103, Connaught Road (near Jin Situ Temple), originally the Sheng family property, has been sealed off by the court for a long time. Recently, the Cilian Relief Society built three new reed mat sheds on the vacant land inside for use as the 34th Refugee Shelter. Yesterday morning, the building (which is in excellent condition) was suddenly occupied by the so-called "Third Brigade of the Special Service Headquarters." The entire team consisted of over a hundred members, most of whom were dressed in plain clothes. Those who were armed wore grass-green uniforms, leggings, and round straw hats with the Blue Sky White Sun emblem in the center. It is evident that they belong to the same organization as the headquarters established at Number 121, Route Tenant de la Tour (inside Gan Gong Elementary School).</p>
<p>School Forced to Close</p>
<p>The Qian Cao South Elementary School at Number 93, Route Tenant de la Tour, was not only used as the 3rd refugee shelter of the Cilian Relief Society, but it also ran a popular literacy school. A group calling themselves the "Shanghai Special Municipality, Western Shanghai Caojiadu Self-Defense Corps" went there the other day to occupy the premises and forced the school to relinquish them. When the school refused, the group piled a large number of hand grenades and Mauser rifles in the classrooms. Unable to maintain operations, the school has already closed down. However, the refugee shelter has not yet been affected.</p>
<h3>Japanese Banks Sell Off Vigorously, Foreign Exchange Tightens, Rumors Resurface in the Market, Black Market Gold Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange, gold, and securities markets have been subject to severe fluctuations due to speculation and profiteering. Recently, with the gradual dissipation of market rumors and the stabilization of public sentiment, the black market for foreign exchange eased, the black market price of gold fell back, and the securities market experienced a sharp rise in national bonds. The entire financial situation improved uniformly. Yesterday, the market experienced a sharp contraction in foreign exchange as Japanese banks vigorously sold off foreign exchange and rumors spread simultaneously. The British exchange rate was 4.4375, and the US exchange rate was 7.375. As a result, the black market price of gold soared due to the sharp contraction in foreign exchange. The morning closing price was 4,047 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 4,058 yuan. The black market for securities saw continued weakness in the Unified Public Bonds. The afternoon closing prices were: Class A, 53.55 yuan; Class B, 46.70 yuan; Class C, 46.25 yuan; Class D, 45.00 yuan; and Class E, 45.55 yuan.</p>

<h3>Military Performance in Western Shanghai Under Japanese Command, Organized to Protect Yamada and Others Visiting Wang, Tense Situation Completely Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, "Great Way" police officers, armed and in full military attire, were stationed along Yu Yuan Road yesterday (the 3rd) to protect the guests invited by Wang Jingwei, turning the "Wild West" area of Western Shanghai into an armed camp. The "Great Way" police, under Japanese command, engaged in this kind of military performance, causing some alarm to the outside world and giving rise to many astonishing and absurd rumors throughout the day. However, the special patrol of the "Great Way" police had mostly withdrawn by last night, and Yu Yuan Road had returned to its peaceful and normal state. The purpose of this unprecedented show of force yesterday was because a team of Japanese military officers, led by Lieutenant General Yamada, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces in Central China, went to the heavily guarded residence of Wang Jingwei on Yu Yuan Road to have lunch with several officials of the new "Kuomintang." The military performance began before 11:00 AM, when a column of about fifteen cars carrying Japanese military officers traveled along Nanjing Road via Jing'an Temple Road to Wang's residence.</p>
<p>Each car</p>
<p>was escorted by Japanese soldiers on motorcycles, and junior Japanese officers with guns in hand. Armed detectives from the Public Settlement Police Department also accompanied them for protection. Before the motorcade reached the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Jing'an Temple Road, "Great Way" police officers in dark green military uniforms practiced saluting under the command of police officers and Japanese supervisors. The new "Great Way" police underwent a final minute of inspection as the cars carrying Wang's guests were about to arrive.</p>
<p>From the intersection of</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple Road, armed "Great Way" police officers were stationed every fifteen yards along both sides of Yu Yuan Road, saluting as the cars passed. The banquet at the residence began to disperse at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The Japanese military officers and their armed teams returned to headquarters via Yu Yuan Road. The "Great Way" police once again guarded the roadside.</p>
<p>Socialist League Theater</p>
<p>News last night stated that when Yamada arrived at Wang's residence, he was welcomed by a "guard of honor" composed of young members of the "Dare to Die Corps" of the new "Kuomintang," hired by Wang. Yesterday morning, the "Great Way" police were concentrated in front of the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade, with the largest number, eighty, lined up in a team. It is estimated that more than two hundred puppet police officers were deployed yesterday.</p>
<h3>Three Indian Youths Travel the World Together, Departed from Mumbai Seven Years Ago by Bicycle, Passed Through Dozens of Countries, Now Arriving in Shanghai, Carrying Indian Goodwill to the World</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, three Indian youths, who set off from Mumbai seven years ago, are traveling the world by bicycle. Climbing mountains, crossing deserts, enduring heat and cold, and experiencing hardships, they have traveled through six continents and dozens of countries. Yesterday (the 3rd), they arrived in Shanghai and will take the route through Australia and East India to return home in 1943. According to Mr. Khara, the leader of the three, who is 36 years old and an insurance salesman, his companions Gandhi, 32, and Xu Luofu, 31, are both electrical engineers. All three of them hope to become educators, so the purpose of this trip is not to sell insurance but to carry Indian knowledge and goodwill to various countries around the world and bring back a broader knowledge of other nations to benefit their compatriots.</p>
<p>They Have Used Up Eight Tires</p>
<p>According to Mr. Khara's statement to reporters yesterday, they feel that they have gained a great deal that can be utilized in India, but they have certainly not obtained everything, as learning is endless. To date, they have used up eight bicycle tires and two bicycles. They do not know how many more tires they will use up traveling through the Philippines and Australia. However, they are confident that their specially made bicycles are strong and durable. They plan to stay in Shanghai for about two weeks and then take a boat to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Published a Book in England</p>
<p>Mr. Khara and his group started their journey seven years ago and first entered the mountainous country of Afghanistan, where they were received and entertained by the country's monarch. They then went to Iran, Turkey, and the Balkan Peninsula countries. By the end of 1935, they had traveled through most of Europe. However, due to the long journey, they were short of funds and had to make a living by giving lectures and writing articles for magazines. While in England, they published a book describing the latest experiences of their journey.</p>
<p>Encountered War on the Way from Europe to Africa</p>
<p>When they went from Europe to Africa, Italy was invading Abyssinia in central Africa. The three of them had to travel around the borders of Abyssinia. Although they encountered many refugees fleeing the war along the way, they did not encounter bandits. However, one night they had to take refuge in a thorny tree due to a herd of elephants passing by, and they were uneasy all night. Then they packed their bags and set off from Cape Town in South Africa, heading to Argentina and South America, and took a boat to Panama City, followed by Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, the United States, and Canada in the West Indies.</p>
<p>Backward Nations Are Openhearted</p>
<p>They have decided to return home. On the way, in addition to Australia, they will also pass through the Malay Peninsula, Java, and Burma. Each traveler carries luggage weighing an average of 120 pounds, containing tents, blankets, stoves, cooking utensils, and typewriters. When a reporter asked Khara yesterday what he had been most impressed with during the entire journey, Khara replied without hesitation, "Generous treatment." It seems that hospitality depends on the state of civilization. Backward nations are very openhearted, but their hospitality is slightly inferior to that of more civilized nations. Khara and his party are being hosted by the Indian Zoroastrian community here and will give a lecture at 6:00 PM on the 11th of this month.</p>

<h3>Relief Movement for Chinese Refugees, All American Churches Participate, Aim is to Raise 5 Million US Dollars Annually, Hundreds of Thousands of Clergy Advocate for Refugees, President Roosevelt Supports</h3>
<p>The American people have consistently persisted in the relief movement for Chinese refugees and have not changed due to the European war. According to news from the International Relief Committee in this city, in order to continue helping Chinese refugees, American church people have recently organized a China Relief Society. Participating and supporting organizations include churches throughout the United States. President Roosevelt and officials of local government agencies have also unanimously supported the society. The society's purpose is to raise a regular relief fund of 5 million US dollars annually for Chinese refugees. It is now actively promoting this goal, and according to recent telegrams, progress is going smoothly. More than two hundred enthusiastic clergymen from churches, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, are now advocating for Chinese refugees, traveling around, and holding meetings to intensify fundraising efforts. Well-known professors from various universities are also enthusiastically participating in various meetings and giving lectures on the issue of relieving Chinese refugees.</p>
<h3>French Police Bureau Cracks Down on Lottery Dens, All Criminals Severely Punished</h3>
<p>After the lottery king Mao Axiang and Li Xiaobao, etc., established the Yiji Lottery Headquarters in Caojiadu under the protection of a certain faction, they secretly dispatched their henchmen to set up listening posts and "boats" in the two settlements. Their business was quite prosperous, and even after the police authorities of the two settlements severely arrested them, it was still difficult to achieve results. Recently, a Ningbo native named Yu Minggao was assigned to set up a large-scale lottery organization at Number 7, Lane 126, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, and distributed his accomplices at Number 1, Lane 400, Rue Conty; Number 110, Route Ratard; Number 7, Lane 237, Avenue Alber; and a bungalow at Number 270, Route Frelupt, to set up "boats" and listening posts, specializing in enticing ordinary people to participate. This was discovered by the Gambling Arrest Squad of the French Police Bureau. On the morning of the 2nd of this month at approximately 11:00 AM, a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, including Detectives Liu Kunbao, Quan Wenwei, Zhang Jianyun, Zhang Huaiqi, and Chen Tinghuai, rushed to the addresses and arrested the main culprits Yu Minggao, Wu Chongzhou, Jiang Dequan, Sun Xizi, Ling Shanglian, and Zhou Panqin. More than three hundred yuan in gambling funds and a large number of lottery tickets were confiscated and taken to the police station, and then transferred to the Second Special Court. After interrogation, each was sentenced to six months imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Unsuccessful Kidnapping for Ransom, Factory Owner Shot to Death, Designated to be Tried by the First Special Court</h3>
<p>Hou Genxiang (also known as Xiao A'gen), from Wuxi, kidnapped Xue Wenlong (also known as A'ren), the owner of the Yilun Silk Reeling Factory, in the area of the Butterfly Bridge in Wuxi on March 25th of this year. The kidnapping for ransom was unsuccessful, and Xue was shot to death. Afterwards, Hou went into hiding at the Liangxi Hostel on Hubei Road in Shanghai. On the morning of August 2nd, he was encountered by the deceased's wife, Xue Dai, who called for his arrest. He was brought to the First Special Court for trial and detained, pending a further trial after the High Court designated jurisdiction. It is now learned that the High Court has designated the First Special Court to handle the case. Therefore, yesterday, the police station continued to send the accused Hou Genxiang to the Criminal Division of the court to be prosecuted for murder. Judge Feng presided over the interrogation. The accused's testimony was cunning, and he was returned to detention pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Tenants in Yuqing Lane Oppose Landlord's Rent Increase</h3>
<p>Yuqing Lane on Robison Road and Moab Road in the Public Settlement has more than eighty houses. The landlord, New Sassoon &amp; Co., recently announced that it would increase the rent by 30% from September, citing increased land damage and water costs. Otherwise, they would ask the tenants to move out. The entire group of tenants then convened a meeting a few days ago and established a Tenants' Union. Yesterday, they commissioned lawyers Qian Shusheng and Wang Xian'gu to send a letter to the landlord, requesting that it withdraw the order to increase the rent.</p>
<h3>Li Tong Returns to the Philippines Today After Visiting Shanghai to Investigate National Products</h3>

<h3>Gasoline Barge Carelessly Catches Fire, Japanese Oil Completely Destroyed, Intended for Use by the Central China Automobile Company, One Boat Saved, the Other Sank</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, at around 7:00 PM on Sunday night, a cargo ship carrying gasoline suddenly caught fire in the Huangpu River near the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil station. The flames were raging, illuminating the Huangpu River. The ship then sank. It was found that the cargo ship was carrying Japanese-made gasoline, intended for use by the Central China Metropolitan Automobile Transportation Company, which is run by the Japanese. It is said that the fire was caused by the smoke from the shipmaster's cooking stove.</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury also reported that detectives from the Water Police Department are still investigating the cause of the major fire on Sunday night involving two gasoline barges in the Huangpu River, but have not yet discovered the reason. After the two barges carelessly caught fire at 9:00 PM, the fire boat Hu Ning immediately sailed to extinguish the blaze. However, the flames were so intense that the Hu Ning had to spray water from a distance. After an hour and twenty minutes of firefighters' efforts, one barge was eventually saved, but the other was completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Reckless Police Officer, Assaults Women, The Assault Occurred When an Attempt to Harass a Woman Failed, The Two Police Officers Have Been Dismissed, and the Woman Has Filed a Lawsuit After Undergoing a Medical Examination</h3>
<p>Zhang Qiu, a widow from Fujian residing at Number 81, Anshun Lane, Route Conty in the French Concession, is forty years old. Her late husband served under Du Xigui, the former Minister of the Navy, and was an officer in the Naval Survey Bureau. On the afternoon of the 26th of last month, at 8:30 PM, Qiu, accompanied by her eighteen-year-old daughter, Xiuyun, was returning home from Rue Moliere. As they walked in front of Number 307 at the intersection of Route Conty and Rue Bayle, a reckless Chinese police officer with badge number 1118 (name unknown)</p>
<p>Reached Out His Hand</p>
<p>to touch Qiu's shoulder and caress her face, making frivolous advances. Qiu rebuked him. The police officer, feeling ashamed and enraged, used his police baton to beat her all over her body. He also summoned his companion, a Russian police officer with badge number 9, to help with the assault. Qiu's daughter, who was standing beside her, was greatly shocked by the sight. Unable to help her mother resist and not daring to shout for help, she ran home and brought her neighbor, Mrs. Huang Wang, to drag Qiu home. Qiu was</p>
<p>Covered with Injuries. The next day, she reported the incident to the police station, requesting a thorough investigation. After questioning, the police chief ordered that the victim be sent to the hospital for examination, which confirmed that she had been injured. The Chinese and Russian police officers who caused the incident were then dismissed, without further prosecution. Thereupon, Zhang Qiu submitted a written statement to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court, requesting a medical examination and then filing a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing the Chinese police officer with badge number 1118 and the Russian police officer with badge number 9 of assault and battery, requesting that they be prosecuted according to law. The court accepted the statement, and Judge Jiang Fengquan opened the trial yesterday morning. The accused did not appear. Only the plaintiff, Zhang Qiu, appeared. After questioning her about her age and origin, the judge ordered the court police to send the summons to the police station, but because both accused had been dismissed, it was impossible to deliver the summons. The hearing was rescheduled to the 11th of this month to investigate the case and summon the accused to appear for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Head Injured by Falling Iron Plate</h3>
<p>Xu Sansan, a local resident, aged twenty, used to work as a sailor on the Shanghai Electric Power Company's No. 5 small steamer. He was recently dismissed from his job due to some incident. Yesterday at 10:15 AM, Xu, having nothing to do, went to the ship in Yangshupu to visit a friend. While they were chatting, a piece of iron plate from the top of the ship's flagpole suddenly fell down, striking Xu directly on the head. He was seriously injured, and his head was covered in blood.

<h3>Renowned Doctor Qin Bowen Sued for Rent, Defendant Requests Payment in Installments</h3>
<p>Renowned Shanghai physician and expert in gynecology, Qin Bowen, rented a house at No. 2 An Village, at the corner of Route des Soeurs, Rue Amiral Bayle, and Avenue Edouard VII in the French Concession from Zhengda Company on June 12 of this year. He intended to establish the Western District branch of his Chinese medicine sanatorium under a long-term lease. Apart from the rent already paid, he still owed 4,000 national currency. Due to being troubled by the Ministry of Finance's Ma Dian Stabilization Financial Measures, he was unable to withdraw bank deposits to pay.</p>
<p>Therefore, another contract was drawn up, pledging the lease right of the house as collateral, with a deadline for paying off or settling the full amount in installments before August 1 of this year. However, after the contract was signed, only 200 legal tender was paid, along with a draft of 300 yuan. After deducting the discount, the creditor only received 261 yuan and 50 cents, leaving a balance of 3,538 yuan and 50 cents. As Qin failed to deliver the payment by the deadline, and after unsuccessful reminders, the creditor, Zhengda Company, through its legal representative Tong Tiyan, requested the Special Second Court to issue a</p>
<p>payment order, urging the debtor Qin Bowen to repay the arrears. Due to objections raised in the case, the debt remained unfulfilled. As a result, Zhengda Company appointed lawyers Li Guozhen and Li Yujun to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against Qin Bowen to recover the rent. Based on the complaint, the court held a hearing yesterday morning presided over by Judge Yu Changzi. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The plaintiff requested the court to order the defendant to</p>
<p>settle the outstanding amount in one lump sum and grant provisional execution. The defendant requested the court to reject the plaintiff's claim and continue with the installment payments previously agreed upon by both parties. There was also a dispute over the deduction of the discount from the 300-yuan draft. Witness Qin Chunfang was also brought to court to testify. After reviewing the situation, the court declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict for the seventh day.</p>
<h3>Fall from Fourth Floor Results in Death</h3>

Due to loss of balance, she fell, hitting her head and dying instantly. Patrol officers reported the incident to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the mortuary for examination.</p>
<h3>Young Traveler Attempts Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>A young traveler, whose name was Heng, at No. 2 of the Detai Inn on Zhejiang Road in the International Settlement, suddenly attempted suicide by poisoning in his room at 6:45 yesterday morning. The tea server discovered him and rushed him to the hospital for treatment. Wang Gentao and Sun Tusheng, shop assistants at the Dahua Leather Goods Store on Yuqiaqing Road, stole leather goods worth 140 yuan on January 11 of this year and fled after selling them off. After the owner, Shen Mogu, reported the theft to the police station, they took a pistol with them the next day and went to Shen to intimidate him. Shen jumped out of the building due to fear, injuring his foot, which has not yet fully healed. Afterwards, they wrote</p>
<p>threatening letters</p>
<p>accusing Shen of selling Japanese goods and attempting to extort 500 yuan, threatening to endanger the lives of his entire family. Xue Youwen, a Chinese detective inspector from the Old Gate Police Station, arrested Wang Gentao, Sun Tusheng, and their accomplice Zhou Zhimao and handed them over to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. After being arrested, Wang and others confessed that their theft and intimidation were instigated by Gu Fusheng, the owner of the Zhongxing Leather Goods Workshop at No. 310, Lane 799, Nanjing Road. The police then</p>
<p>investigated Gu. Gu also surrendered to the police and submitted certificates from the Leather Goods Trade Association and the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, proving that he was indeed an upright and legitimate businessman. He claimed that the accusations were malicious slander by Wang and others. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide held a preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Division. Shen Mogu, due to his unhealed foot injury, appointed lawyer Wu Peng to appear in court and filed an incidental civil suit. The defendants also hired lawyers Tao Wuzhi and others to defend them. The police lawyer Ru Baozhen</p>
<p>recounted the incident. The three defendants, Wang and others, were charged with theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Code, and obstruction under Articles 305 and 346 of the same code. It was also alleged that on January 22, they robbed Zhu Xingchang's Leather Goods Workshop at No. 43, Lane 685, Gordon Road, of 20 yuan. Therefore, they were also charged with robbery. It was also stated that regarding the defendants' claim that they were instigated by Gu Fusheng, after a thorough investigation by the police,</p>
<p>the police found that the defendants' confessions were accurate and there was no reason to doubt them and proved their claims were facts. Therefore, it had been decided not to prosecute Gu. Wang Gentao and others confessed to the theft, intimidation, and attempted extortion. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Feng Shide adjourned the case for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, In the local news section on page three of your newspaper on the 2nd of this month, there was a report about a case where the pawnshop manager, Lu Jidong from Anhui, sued the accountant, Xu Hualiang. It was stated that Xu Hualiang currently resides on the second floor of No. 5 Fushou Fang, Huanlong Road. I found this to be very perplexing, as the above address is currently my residence, and there is no one named Xu Hualiang living here. The Special Second Court sent a summons on the 20th of last month, which was signed and returned by the sublessee, Mr. Chen, as proof. Moreover, Lu Jidong is from Chongming. He visited me out of hometown friendship on the 20th of last month and knew that Xu Hualiang did not live here. What was his intention in deliberately misleading the court? In addition to personally reprimanding him, I earnestly request your newspaper to publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Huang Yutao, October 3rd, Address: No. 5 Fushou Fang, Huanlong Road. To the Editor, Regarding the news item published in your newspaper on the 1st of this month, "Hua Wen She" reported that Baotai Pawnshop suffered a fire and refused to compensate, and on the following day, lawyer Wang Heng Gu, representing the pawnshop, sent a letter requesting a correction, stating that my law firm was not involved in the matter. After the Baotai Pawnshop fire, lawyer Wang issued a notice stating that except for a portion of the jewelry that could be redeemed, the pawnshop would not be responsible for the remaining pledged items, citing force majeure. After seeing the notice, the pawnshop customers were unwilling to accept it and came to entrust my law firm to represent them. They requested a notice to be sent to all Baotai Pawnshop customers who had not yet participated in the registration, urging them to register as soon as possible for verification and negotiation. Currently, there are over a hundred registered customers, with pledges amounting to several thousand yuan or more. My law firm has already negotiated with the pawnshop, but there has been no response. We are now preparing to formally proceed according to the law. As for the correction stated by lawyer Wang on behalf of the pawnshop, it is absolutely untrue. I am deeply concerned that it may cause confusion, and I am hereby writing to correct the facts. I hope it will be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section of your newspaper. I eagerly await this. Sincerely, Lawyer Ji Chao, October 4th.</p>

<h3>From "Emotional Expression" to "Thief" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ren</p>
<p>It is permissible to praise those who died for the Ming Dynasty, and even to mourn the Ming emperors, because the "Great Qing" also encourages loyal subjects and wants to show the "magnanimity" of "our dynasty." This can be understood by looking at how the Qing Shizu is said to have cried at Chongzhen's imperial tomb in the "History of the Ming Dynasty." However, there is one thing that the "Great Qing" considers most important: you must vigorously denounce the cruelty of the "thieves," because that way everyone will remember that the "Great Qing" quelled the internal rebellion, and it will also show that it was the "thieves" who destroyed the Ming Dynasty, not the "Great Qing." But this policy happened to suit the tastes of those "recluses" of the early Qing Dynasty. Some of those "recluses" actually lived on the Qing dynasty's official salaries, so this method was extremely suitable for their status: on the one hand, they expressed their loyalty to the previous dynasty, and on the other hand, they did not offend "our dynasty." Therefore, they tried their best to dress the Qing soldiers in ceremonial robes and paint the "thieves" with flowery faces in their writings.</p>
<p>However, the "thieves" did not give up fighting for the fallen Ming Dynasty. The "righteous people" of the time, although disdained by our current young literary men, were, after all, figures who sacrificed themselves for the nation. But the masses they summoned were the restless peasants, who were also the "thieves" who were always spoken of, and in fact, many of them came from Li Zicheng's ranks. The "thieves" were not the kind of "robbers" we have always understood who only knew how to kill and set fires.</p>
<p>But our young literary men insist on faithfully copying the writings of the "recluses" of the early Qing Dynasty. Apart from making people think that they are inheriting the literary tradition of the "emotional expression" school of literary men, one cannot imagine what other purpose there is.</p>
<p>What the consequences will be for these literary men in the future is still "under observation," let us see what the facts will be in the future.</p>
<h3>Printing Workers in the Yan'an Border Region</h3>
<p>— Ye Fen</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Life in Twenty-Four Hours</p>
<p>The night has not yet faded completely, and the sunlight has already revealed a corner of its head. A few charming rosy clouds lightly cling to the sky, so gorgeous.</p>
<p>Faint morning shadows gradually painted the surroundings of the earth, showing the contours of mountains and rivers, and the shallow grass by the stone was gently stroked. On the southwest corner of Qingliang Mountain, hundreds of people, like little birds, began to become active. These were the printing workers of the border region printing factory learning the scenes of field warfare. They moved nervously, busy advancing, stabbing, ambushing, and encircling, as if stubborn enemies were waiting for them in front.</p>
<p>Their shadows swept over this hilltop, and then over that hilltop. Then, they heard the sound of majestic singing, which meant they had completed this lesson. Everyone wiped the sweat hanging on their faces with a handkerchief, and with relaxed smiles, they happily stepped back to the foot of the mountain. Looking at the eastern corner, the sunlight had unknowingly revealed its entire face, taking care of their return route so clearly and refreshingly.</p>
<p>As the sunlight gently climbed into the cracks of the windows, the clang of the machines began to rise from the Great Buddha Hall, carrying the clamor of labor. This group of warriors had stored up the enthusiastic emotions and unrestrained postures they had at dawn, and turned into such composure, as if they were sucked in by the lead type trays and machine parts, using their thick hands to deftly grab bright star-like letters and fold piles of printed materials like snowflakes—here it was "Selected Works of Lenin," there it was "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," and also "Liberation Daily," and "New China Daily," which were sent in large batches to the binding room by several logistics comrades; in that binding room, a dozen female workers were toiling away; because there were no new-style binding machines here, they mostly used their two small hands to replace them, doing "trimming," "punching," and "tieing wires" to complete the appearance of these books and newspapers.</p>
<p>The noisy sound turned to the wasteland at the foot of the mountain, where the sunlight was striking at a right angle. Like a group of construction workers building a road, they were scattered into several small piles, each pile surrounded by one or two cans of green vegetables and bean sprouts, standing and hurriedly eating their lunch. They chewed happily, laughing and joking... After the meal, they rested. The pause was right here, and then playing ball began—"basketball" and "football."</p>
<p>The ball was rolling, leaping, and their hearts were even more lively, clashing with each other like fierce tigers out of a cage. The ball was as round as the scorching sun, so tenacious. They just kept pushing and playing with it. They sweated, chasing non-stop, having fun, feeling fully happy, and then smiling at each other.</p>
<p>The sunlight was like drilling into a bottomless deep hole, going from bright to dim, and then to hazy, and the surroundings of Yan'an were so immersed in deepness.</p>
<p>If there were a borrowed light object in the sky tonight, you could see their shadows in groups of three or five on the diameter of entering Wanfo Temple. If the sky happened to have nothing at all, that would of course make you feel very mysterious, right? If you have a curious heart, you might as well go grope around on that road and give your feet a step-by-step climb. (Note 1) When you slowly grope to the end, you will see a dim light accompanying them sitting in a circle, quietly listening to one person "speaking."</p>
<p>The pattern is somewhat like the storytelling place in the southern village, the speaker is so vivid and the listeners are so absorbed, but there is no sound of chewing melon seeds here, and no aroma of cigarettes. Yes, if you get closer, you can faintly see them still constantly drawing quickly on the paper with pencils.</p>
<p>They were having class! This is everything in their twenty-four hours, in addition to practicing field warfare in the morning and working during the day, there is also such a course in the evening——"United Front Course".</p>
<p>Note 1: The road there is built</p>
<p>gradually rising in the hillside</p>
<h3>A Little Song</h3>
<p>— Xu Ye</p>
<p>The Sound of the Qin</p>
<p>In the dead of night, where does the poignant sound of the ancient Greek qin come from?</p>
<p>Not only do my ears hear the sound of the qin, but just mentioning the name of the qin gives me an inexplicable feeling.</p>
<p>This feeling gnaws deeply at my heart, and I will never forget it. For the qin, for my beloved qin, I have been longing for it during the long days.</p>
<p>The qin came from Singapore. A friend brought it back to the motherland from Malaysia. This friend was a singer who had studied Western music for many years.</p>
<p>He liked to sing Beethoven's songs, the Russian Boatmen's Song, and he happily howled the famous songs of ancient Rome. Moreover, in Southeast Asia, he learned the March of the Volunteers.</p>
<p>The memory is exactly the autumn night scene, with a bright moon and shooting stars. He walked alone by the small river.</p>
<p>Singing a powerful song from his throat, the qin moved in his fingers, attracting a group of children who liked this music they had never heard before.</p>
<p>"Can you sing? Follow me, the first sentence is Rise..."</p>
<p>"Rise, rise..."</p>
<p>Soon, the children sang, following the sound of his qin, forming a team, and in the dusk, this sound was like thunder, like a tsunami, as if the wind had swept over the calm lake, suddenly causing countless waves, surging and rushing.</p>
<p>"Sing the Boatmen's Song, no, the Marseillaise!"</p>
<p>"Oh! It's always best to have our March of the Volunteers come to a conclusion!"</p>
<p>In this way, I sang, and kept singing through many days and nights.</p>
<p>In October, our singer disappeared. He left me only this violin from Malaysia.</p>
<p>I cherished the qin and hid it away. He told me to go to Yunnan and Sichuan. I know he is now healthy in the ancient city of Yan'an.</p>
<p>But what about the qin? Is it resting peacefully on my bookshelf in my hometown? Is it covered with a thick layer of dust? Are the strings and bow perhaps being eroded by bookworms? But, who can tell the whereabouts of that violin under the smoke of cannons and bullets? What is hoped for is the battle of the qin, that it will not become the instrument of shameless people, but will be the ready-made horn of the masses, and in the hands of warriors, it will roar out the march and the Marseillaise!</p>
<p>The ancient Greek-style sound of the qin in the late night gradually became quiet, and I carefully looked at the crescent moon pinned on the clouds, suddenly longing for the lost violin.</p>
<p>Let the qin I lost be lost</p>
<p>"Each has its own characteristics"</p>
<h3>Two Miscellaneous Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Lan Wen</p>
<p>Cross</p>
<p>One cross connected to another, but my thoughts stretch left and right to infinity.</p>
<p>Are these the days bought with bones? That resolute loyalty, that passionate dedication, should always be an encouragement and a greeting, right?</p>
<p>The era has cast the cross for the residents of this ancient land. For the sake of survival, we all have to carry it, right?</p>
<p>You and I must all be martyrs.</p>
<p>The Weather is Cold</p>
<p>The west wind blows down the paulownia leaves, and also sways my emotions, the weather is cold!</p>
<p>We live in such a city, and colorful pieces of paper have confused people's minds. Conscience is already a superfluous noun.</p>
<p>Raising my head, I saw a beautiful bird in a cage on a branch—I can't say its correct name. Its chirping calls are singing the fulfillment and comfort of life, right?</p>
<p>Poor thing, don't you dislike the smallness of the world in the cage? Don't you have the melancholy of not being able to fly?</p>
<p>Bird? Human? Look up and look around! Our place is also a world of barbed wire!</p>
<p>However, outside the barbed wire, people who are unwilling to live in slavery are doing solemn and great work. For the sake of freedom, they shed blood.</p>
<p>The weather is cold! I remembered the warrior's clothes. What should I do?</p>
<h3>Coming Goose</h3>
<p>— Yang Di</p>
<p>Is a green grass in the desert,</p>
<p>temporarily breathing from suffocation,</p>
<p>inspiring the natural thoughts of loving beauty,</p>
<p>to rush to the boundless wilderness.</p>
<p>Like lightning in the darkness,</p>
<p>even if it's just for a moment,</p>
<p>I also saw the sky and the earth groping forward, relying on memory.</p>
<p>A white pigeon flew from afar,</p>
<p>giving me a heartfelt excitement,</p>
<p>"Can you let me get on your back,</p>
<p>and take me back to the source of light?"</p>

<h3>A Great Contribution to the Film Industry—"Explanatory Headphones" Will Be Available at Grand Cathay</h3>
<p>— Shu Xiaochun</p>
<p>Chinese people love to watch foreign films, but those who do not have a deep understanding of foreign languages often cannot grasp the subtleties of the plot, and can only observe the actions and expressions of the actors. Therefore, when the characters in the film make humorous and lighthearted remarks, the Westerners in the audience laugh heartily, while the Chinese who do not understand foreign languages are dumbfounded and do not know what they are saying. This is truly a flaw. Therefore, good films with intricate plots and many dialogues often do not sell as well as ordinary films with mediocre plots and more action, perhaps for this reason. In order to remedy this regret, film companies often add Chinese subtitles to the films, but the procedure is troublesome and must be shipped to Japan for printing, as China currently does not have such equipment. On the theater side, some theaters project explanatory slides next to the screen, but these are often brief, and whether subtitles are added to the film or explanatory slides are projected, the audience feels that they have to choose between one or the other. Recently, I heard that the Grand Cathay Theater, in order to thoroughly improve this point, has spent a lot of money to install the latest type of "explanatory headphones" first. If time permits, I heard that they plan to start supplying them in the short term.</p>
<p>The so-called "explanatory headphones" are similar to wireless radio headsets that are worn on the head. When using them, simply insert the wire into the "plug" next to the seat, put them on your ears, and you can hear the Mandarin explanation and dialogue, in detail and clearly, without obstructing the vision of your eyes. When listening to songs, simply take off the headphones, and the original sound of the film can still be heard, as the film is always playing sound. As for the Mandarin explanation in the "explanatory headphones," the theater will translate and broadcast it at any time according to the plot. Audience members who can understand foreign languages can choose not to use these headphones, and there is no extraneous noise to disturb their hearing. Therefore, this equipment has only advantages and no disadvantages, and it is truly a great contribution. I am writing this in advance to record it.</p>
<h3>Recent Hong Kong Film News</h3>
<p>— Cui Ping</p>
<p>Hu Die and Chen Yuanyuan. The subject matter of Hu Die's new work was initially said to be "Yang Guifei," then "Philippine Islands Blood Case," and later there was talk of filming the story of Chen Yuanyuan. Now I hear that because ancient costume films are easier to collect box office revenue in the current film market, it has been decided to film Chen Yuanyuan first. The script has already been written and renamed "Peerless Beauty." This film will still adopt the "Rouge Tears" method, filming both Mandarin and Cantonese sound versions. Xinhua Company is cooperating with South Yue Company here, directed by Wang Juelong, starring Wang Naidong, Tang Huaiqiu, Peng Fei, and others.</p>
<p>China's Mount Tai Completed. The film "China's Mount Tai" (renamed from "Adventures on Mount Tai"), which was produced by Xinhua Company in Hong Kong, directed by Wang Juelong, and starring strongman Peng Fei, Li Zhuozhuo, Wang Naidong, Bai Yin, and others, has been completed. This film largely takes the famous natural scenic areas of Hong Kong as its background. The towering mountains, deep rivers, and vast marshes create a majestic atmosphere. Among them, one of the giant trees where the Mount Tai people nest is four people cannot fully encircle the tree trunk. The tree is named Banyan and is over a thousand years old. The branches and roots are interconnected, as if they were artificially connected and supported. The dense shade covers an area of about one acre (it is said that if the tree were felled for timber, it could be sold for more than 10,000 Hong Kong dollars). The Mount Tai film is greatly enhanced by this. Peng Fei, who plays Mount Tai, is re-entering the film world. At the beginning of the establishment of Yihua Company many years ago, Peng starred in "Flames" and "National Survival." This time, playing China's Mount Tai, his strong physique is on par with the Western Mount Tai, Weissmuller, and his skills in somersaulting and jumping are also particularly outstanding. Wang Naidong, Li Zhuozhuo, and others also have unique performances, and the director's use of skills is also unique. I heard that they will continue to film in succession in the future.</p>
<p>Lu Cuilan Marries the Cowherd. Lu Cuilan is starring in a costume film based on the folk tale "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," adapted by Xia Yan, in Hong Kong, co-starring Tang Huaiqiu and members of the China Travel Drama Troupe. It has recently been completed. It was originally scheduled to be released during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but because it could not be completed within the scheduled time, it has now been changed to be screened on Double Ten Day. I heard that this film has a strong sense of the times. It was initially named "Flower of the Earth," but it has now been renamed "New Milky Way Match."</p>

<h3>Talking About Wu Suqiu's Lantern Festival Riddle</h3>
<p>— Mei Yi</p>
<p>"Lantern Festival Riddle" is one of the unique famous plays of Xun Ruisheng of Xiaoliuxiang Pavilion. Its popularity in Tianjin is as great as Mei Wan Hua's "Phoenix Returns to the Nest," Cheng Yu Shuang's "Wild Mountain Tears," and Shang Xiao Yun's "Lady of the Lantern Festival." When Wu Suqiu entered Xun's school, Liuxiang immediately presented the "Lantern Festival Riddle" script as a gift. He told her: "This script is one of Mr. Chen Moxu's masterpieces. The complexity of the singing and acting, and the beauty of the plot, can be compared with "Hairpin Head Phoenix" and will be passed down immortally. I give it to you now. I hope you will cherish it forever. If you perform it in Shanghai in the future, you will definitely return with honor." Suqiu respectfully thanked him. I heard that Wu Ling plans to use this play as a breakthrough, but because the arrangement takes time, it has not been possible to fulfill her wish. After a week of rehearsal, all the supporting roles in the play are skilled. In the shortest time (approximately this Friday), it can begin its public performance. The plot of this play is sometimes tragic and sometimes happy, bringing the ability of extremely sad emotion and stubborn beauty to the fullest. The following is a summary of its outline:</p>
<p>Lü Zhaohua is the daughter of Gang Zhong, the Minister of Rites. Her name is Guo Shengtianzhang. Before she was married, Tianzhang's father died. The Guo family was very poor. Gang Zhong was afraid that Tianzhang would lose his education, so he housed him at his home. During the Lantern Festival, Gang Zhong went out at night and returned to Tianzhang's place, where he saw a man and a woman sleeping on the same pillow, resembling Zhaohua and Tianzhang. He was shocked and angry, but considering the reputation of his family, he restrained himself and turned away. The next day, he rebuked Tianzhang. Tianzhang was not humbled, so Gang Zhong was furious and drove Tianzhang away, and blamed his wife, Zhao, and forced Zhaohua to die. At that time, an imperial envoy came to summon Gang Zhong by order of the emperor. Zhaohua still wanted to commit suicide, but Lady Zhao could not stop her, and her uncle, Zhao Banhou, arrived just in time. Banhou had previously stationed troops on the border as a general and entrusted his daughter, Xiuying, to Lady Zhao. At that time, he was going to take up the post of Admiral of Guangdong and was coming to pick up his daughter. At this point, he left Xiuying to serve Lady Zhao and took Zhaohua with him, reporting her death to Gang Zhong. Tianzhang, when he was driven away, was very angry and sent a letter to break off the engagement. However, Banhou saw it and, fearing that he would seriously hurt Zhaohua's heart, secretly kept his letter and calmly chose a marriage for Zhaohua. After a while, a new school commissioner, Zhang Lingge, came, a young man who had passed the imperial examination and was unmarried. Banhou then betrothed Zhaohua to him, and an agreement was reached, but Zhaohua refused. She became ill from sorrow, and Banhou went to Guangdong to invite Lady Zhao to comfort Zhaohua. While traveling, she saw Zhang Lingge, who was her former husband, Guo Tianzhang, and she had no objections. Tianzhang changed his name and passed the imperial examination because Gang Zhong was in charge of the civil service examinations. When they were about to get married, Gang Zhong also returned from Guangdong after being sent to Ryukyu. Banhou invited him to attend the wedding, and the father, daughter, and son-in-law met in the same hall, and then they were able to explain the previous misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Anecdotes from the Pear Garden (Opera World)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Actors and Opium</p>
<p>Qingkui and Shuyan both had smoky voices, but their methods of using them were quite different. Qingkui liked to exert himself vigorously when performing on stage, using all his strength, to the point that later he would run out of breath and his voice would get softer and softer. When he was recording "Crying at the Qin Court" for Victory Records, one *daoban* (a type of aria) took up more than a minute. The engineer was not very satisfied, saying that each record cost a thousand dollars, with only three minutes per side, and the company spent five hundred dollars to buy only two lines of singing, which seemed too unworthy. As for the other one, his voice was close to Liu Bo's style. If he could specialize in learning Hongsheng's (a particular style of Peking Opera), and not also sing Sun Pai's (another style) "Xiaoyao Jin" with forced effort, his voice would definitely not have deteriorated so quickly. Whenever Shuyan performed on stage, his voice was extremely low and soft, sometimes even with a hoarse sound, but afterwards it would become brighter and brighter, clear and full, without showing any strain at all. This showed the value of a "skillful voice." At the same time, Shuyan's ability to use his voice was unmatched by others.</p>
<p>Later, I heard people say that Qingkui had returned to smoking opium, but his voice still had not recovered. From this, it can be seen that the relationship between opium and an actor's voice is even closer and more important. As for why his vocal cords suddenly became hoarse and unable to produce sound after he quit smoking opium, we still need to ask experts in medicine to study it carefully.</p>
<p>I have a classmate, a doctor with the surname Wu, who studied medicine in Germany and specialized in pulmonary tuberculosis. According to him, many famous German doctors admit that it is beneficial for people with lung disease to smoke opium. The reason is that opium has astringent properties. It cannot be said that it can cure lung disease, but it can maintain the original state and prevent people with lung disease from progressing from the first stage to the second or third stage. Furthermore, the thing that people with lung disease fear the most is coughing too severely, which can damage the heart and lungs, and wouldn't the condition worsen day by day? Since opium has the effect of stopping coughs and relieving asthma, it is not only beneficial to people suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, but also allows actors to avoid coughing and asthma when performing on stage, preventing them from hindering their singing and modulating their voice. This is also the biggest reason why actors are so fond of opium. (113)</p>
<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>The Four Feathers</h3>
<p>— Qihua</p>
<p>"Four Feathers"</p>
<p>"The Four Feathers" is a production of the British Alexander Korda Company. It consistently promotes the glorious achievements of the British army in conquering the natives of Africa. However, it encourages the public to bravely stand on the front lines and serve the motherland. From our perspective "here and now," the story of "The Four Feathers" is also worth promoting.</p>
<p>The story is as follows: On the eve of the British North Surrey Regiment's departure for Egypt, Harry suddenly requests to resign. His colleagues Willoughby, Burroughs, Durrance, etc., mock him for his cowardice and retreating at the last moment, and each present him with a white feather. To clear his name, Harry decides to go to Egypt alone: to rescue his three friends and help the British army defeat the natives.</p>
<p>The production of "The Four Feathers" is like "The Drum Beats." The director devoted all his efforts to several large-scale war scenes, such as: (1) When the British commander-in-chief ordered Burroughs, Willoughby, and Durrance to lead a small number of British troops to lure the natives, the natives besieged them, the British army resisted, cavalry galloped, rockets shot everywhere, and the British army was eventually captured due to being outnumbered; and (2) Harry secretly handed a steel file to Burroughs and conspired to escape. At that time, the British army happened to attack in large numbers, so they cooperated from the inside and the outside to defeat the natives. The tight editing and the grandeur of the scenes in these two scenes all show the director's outstanding skills. The scene where Harry rescues Durrance is even more moving. For example: After Harry wakes up, he helps Durrance back to the camp; Durrance intends to kill himself with a gun, Harry takes away the gun and supports him with a cane; they search for water on the desolate sandy land; by the river, he plunges into the water. Here, the director uses the black shadows of the hawks flying in the sky to set off the danger of the two living people on the ground, and uses various difficult and arduous scenes to strengthen their sincere friendship. This exquisite and meticulous technique is more lovely than his handling of large scenes. Other scenes, such as Harry dressing up as a native and using singing and whip sounds when pulling the boat along the river, and ten years ago, when Harry fell asleep, he held a candle, and the candlelight reflected on heroic photos, are also exquisite and lovely.</p>
<p>Ralph Richardson, who plays Durrance, is the best actor. After his eyes were damaged by the poisonous sunlight, his acting became very serious. John Clements (Harry) is also calm and powerful.</p>
