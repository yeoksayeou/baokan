<h3 id="c1">導言 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>痧子是一種發出疹子的熱病，凡年齡在十歲以內的小孩最容易息的，不過這種病如果不明白病理，不講究調護，胡亂地吞丸服藥任意地胃風不忌口，那就糟糕了。所以到那痧子流行的時候，往往聽到某家的少君因發痧子而死了，某家的小姐因發痧子危險到不可救藥了，慘酷而可怖的消息，接一連二的傳過來。一般沒有醫藥常識的人，聽到了發痧子三個字，已經畏懼到不寒而慄了。鄙人是內幼科醫生。日常診治的兒病不少，其中尤以痧子爲獨多，所以對於痧子的經騐比較豐富些，數年來會經收集了許多兒病專書，深切地下了一番研究功夫，又把一般醫生治療痧子所以失敗的原因，歸併起來，加以改良，現在對於痧子的種種病候，種種變化，悉數明白，由怎様的方法可以救逆，怎樣的方法可以救險何者是必死證，何者是雖險不死，胸有成竹，指下無疑。不是說句誇口話，只要患痧子的小孩，未經雜藥誤治，鄙人可以十愈其十，若經誤治，那就變化無窮了，不過當那變化的時候，病家如果肯堅決的信仰，細心地接受鄙人的指導和可嚀。大的十個中間，還可挽救六七個。現在我看社會上有小孩的人家，一旦患了痧子，旣不知醫生所處藥方的對證與吾，又不知施行合法的調護，弄得手忙脚亂，不知如何是好，換句話說，簡直等於盲人瞎馬，夜半深池，你想危險不危險呢？最後結果，還是一命嗚呼，說起來眞是慘極了！鄙人爲憐憫心驅策，實在不忍坐視，願將此病的始末情形，其中的變化，以及治療方法，詳詳細細地寫出來。告訴那一般做父母的，使得大家有了這種常識，可以有備無患，雖不能說是慈航寶筏，却也可以當得起識途老馬。深願讀者諸君。化却極短的時間，少量的精神，把此文從頭讀一遍，包你可以增加不少常識，臨到自己的小孩發痧子的時候，不致心慌意亂，無所適從了，這是區區的一片誠意。</p>
<h3 id="c2">痧子之成因 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>小孩子會發痧子，成年人也會發痧子，這痧子究竟從那裏來的呢？據醫書上說。是先天的胎毒，男女構精的時候，已經伏下了根株，照此說來，痧子完全是內因，但是天花也兌胎毒，每人只發一决，幷且種了牛痘，可以避免，痧子旣然是胎毒，何以要發好幾次呢？並且早不發晚不發，一定要在痧子流行的時候發呢？所以我說痧子純粹內因這句話有些不的確。據西醫的說法，完全是微菌傳染的關係，無所謂內因，這個說法也不十分靠得住。何以呢？試問痧子流行開始的第一個病人，是誰去傳染給他的呢？如果不信，我可舉出事實來證明。譬如張君家裏有三個小孩子，兩個成人，其中一個人不幸在痧子流行的時候發起痧子來了。那麼病室裏，勢必滿佈着病菌空氣，照我們中國人的習慣，家裹有人病了之後，不論其傳染病非傳染病，事實上極少隔離療養的。那麼一家的人在病室裏，隨便出入，隨便和病人接觸，旣然這樣，照例張君家裏的五個人每個人都吸致病菌，每個人都應該傳染：然而事實告訴我們不是這様的？有的傳染，有的不傳染，那麼完全微菌傳染關係的話。豈不是根本動搖了嗎？所以痧子純粹外因也不可信。據我的經騐，經過了精密考慮的結果，可以決定痧子的成因，旣要具備先天胎毒的內因，又要吸到病菌做外因，還要有新感胃做誘因，誘因可說是導火線，於是裏應外合，一觸即發，吾則，單絲不成線，決不會發痧子的。</p>
<h3 id="c3">痧子之病理 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>痧子的成因，上文已經說過了，可是近來又有一種新發現，當那痧子流行的時候，常常碰到沒有發過痧子的孩子病起寒熱來了，照例旣有先天的胎毒，又遇病菌空氣，又有新感胃，應當發痧子了，然而事實上有的一服疎解藥，寒熱立解，因此不發痧子的很多，所以我知道發痧子的條件，除了上文所說的三個以外，又必須寒熱不退，鬱蒸三數日，那麽必然發痧子了；所以如果在初病的時候，只要能够用藥得當，注意病孩的飲食寒暖，有時竟然可以避免的，這不是很快慰的一種心得嗎？痧子之發病，必須要兼外感，又必須外感不解鬱蒸數日，乃發痧子，所以我說痧子是一發痧的熱病，絲毫不錯的。旣然是熱病，熱病是傷寒範團以內的事，那麼治療痧子的方法，當然要根據傷寒裏的方子了。</p>
<h3 id="c4">痧前之病象 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>（甲）欬嗽發痧子的前一步見證，就是咳嗽。繼續發現的是鼻子不通，打噴嚏，流淸涕，呵欠，眼眶裏包滿着淚水。這種種證狀，等於普通的重傷風。此時可服下面的方藥。</p>
<p>炒防風一錢杏仁三錢</p>
<p>前胡錢半象貝三錢</p>
<p>杜橘紅錢半炙蘇子三錢</p>
<p>桑葉三錢</p>
<p>藥方加减法：如果病人苔膩而厚，不知飢，此爲有積，方中加山查炭三錢焦麥芽三錢溲少，或短赤，或白如米泔此爲膀胱有熱，方中加赤白苓各三錢梗通一錢。</p>
<p>（乙）發熱當那欬嗽初起的時候，身體還未發熱，大的經過了二三天，欬嗽加重了，最厲害的欬嗽完全不爽，並且連續不已，一日半日之後，氣急鼻扇，發熱，嘔吐都來了，若問何以會氣急鼻扇呢？，因爲欬嗽之故。劇咳何以會使氣急鼻扇呢？因爲劇劇不已，氣管震動，磨擦不已，於是發炎，氣管發炎而表現於外者，就是氣急鼻扇，講到發熱，却有三種不同。</p>
<p>（一）無汗的發熱病孩渾身壯熱，其熱可以灼手，內經上所謂體若燔炭，然而熱度只管高，汗是沒有的，病人鬱蒸得非常痛苦，甚至神志不清。</p>
<p>（二）有汗的發熱發熱的時候，渾身微有汗，汗出之後，熱度稍低，然不得退淸，隔一會兒，熱又高起來了。此種汗，在醫學上名之曰自汗，是不能退熱的一種汗。</p>
<p>（三）但頭汗的發熱病人身體壯熱，周身四肢都無汗，頭部却有汗，或者齊頸有汗，此種名曰但頭汗，因熱無出路，在內鬱蒸之故，但是頭部儘管汗多，熱勢終不低降。以上三種，發熱經過的時間，大的要二三天，在這二三天裏。如果不能用藥退熱，那麽痧子就醞釀成功了。在道個時期裏，三種不同的發熱，有三種不同的治法。</p>
<p>附三秤發熱的治法</p>
<p>（一）無汗發熱的治法。</p>
<p>炙麻黃四分杏仁三錢</p>
<p>炙草六分橘紅錢半</p>
<p>炙蘇子三錢葛根錢半</p>
<p>藥方加减法如果病人有</p>
<p>積方中當加枳實炭一錢</p>
<p>查炭三錢倘若無汗熱高</p>
<p>而叉煩躁不安當加生石膏</p>
<p>五錢。</p>
<p>（二）有汗發熱的治法：</p>
<p>枝尖二分杏仁三錢</p>
<p>葛根二錢炙草五分</p>
<p>薄荷六分橘紅錢半</p>
<p>象貝三錢牛蒡三錢。</p>
<p>藥方加减法裏熱盛加</p>
<p>生石膏五錢，嘔惡加黃芩</p>
<p>錢半川連三分。</p>
<p>（三）但頭汗發熱的治法：</p>
<p>生石膏三錢炙麻黃四分</p>
<p>杏仁三錢炙草六分</p>
<p>葛根錢半。</p>
<p>藥方加减法有積加枳實</p>
<p>炭一錢査炭三錢欬劇</p>
<p>加象貝三錢炙蘇子三錢</p>
<p>杜橘紅錢半</p>
<p>以上三方主意在乎透達熱邪，如果病人邪熱輕微的，經過透達之後，病就中止了，痧子也不發了。如果邪多熱重的話，服了上面的藥方。可以把熱邪透出來，還可帮助體功發痧子。因爲痧子以透淸爲最要緊，能够早日透淸更好，上列二方就有此種功效，讀者苟能按照病情對證發藥，包可化大病爲小病，化小病爲無病，如果病型不循常軌，發生疑問時，從速延請良醫診斷，千萬不可坐失病機，後悔無及。</p>
<h3 id="c5">發痧子病象 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>痧子經過了初期的潛伏，發熱期的醞釀，那麼要見點子了，這種點子在皮膚上滿佈着，以手捫之，痧點粒粒墳起，色澤甚爲鮮紅，如此者三日，痧點漸决隱沒，欬嗽反而加多，熱度逐漸低降，病就日漸痊愈，這是痧子最正常的病型，不過痧子見點期內變化最多，大的十個中間，七八個要變化的，倘若不明白種種變化的道理，沒有方法對付種種變化的病證，還不能算懂得痧子，茲再簡明的寫出來獸給諸位讀者。、</p>
<h3 id="c6">痧子種類 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>（一）風痧痧子中饅輕的名曰風痧，他的證狀有微微的發熱，有輕鬆的欬嗽，渾身小汗蒸蒸，一發熱就有紅點出現，不過若隱若現，還不很淸楚，衣被稍暖，痧點就顯明地吐露了，如果小孩身體强健的，可以照常玩耍，並無顯著的病態，經過三五日，自然恢復原狀，不過做父母的在這個時期裹，不必替他諸醫生服藥，只要禁止他不可出外吹風，同時要禁止他吃葷，那麼可以保險無事，吾則流弊也很可怕，像欬嗽延久不愈，傷及嬌嫩的肺藏，此其一。渾身痧點不沒而發奇癢，後來可以轉成痧疤瘡，痧點終身不沒，皮膚糙燥異常，平日衣被稍暖，立刻奇癢難當，如果在大庭廣衆問，發癢起來，旣不便扒搔，又不克忍耐，那眞沒趣極了，所以做父母的在這個時候。不能不替他特別注意的。</p>
<p>（二）紅痧這種痧子，最爲多見，比較風痧要險重得多，事實上非服藥不可，苟能治療得當，調護得宜，可以化險爲夷。反之，則有生命之險，這種痧子，在初期的時候，欬嗽頗劇，甚至完全不爽，或竟氣急鼻　，發熱時期內熱度極高，有時神錯　語，見點期中，很不容易顯明吐露，或者胸背見點，手足全無，或者雖見而不透，熱度高升，始終不肯低降，這個時候，應該從速把痧子透發出來，方如左：</p>
<p>葛根錢牛杏仁三镥</p>
<p>赤白苓各三錢無價散一</p>
<p>分冲</p>
<p>桑葉三錢薄荷六分</p>
<p>藥方加減法無汗方中加麻黃三分裏熱重加石膏四錢</p>
<p>連喬三錢銀花三錢神昏加膽草三分鈞尖三錢。</p>
<p>外用芫　菜泡湯熱熨，痧點透齊，就可熱退。神淸，欬爽。</p>
<p>（三）白面痧這種痧子，要算最險重了，其特異之點，就是渾身痧點已齊。獨面部不見，病人泛泛欲惡，及後環辱隱靑，面色靑白，大便溏薄，或竟泄瀉，此時病極沉重，險象環生，因爲痧子光是身上出齊出透，還是無用，最要緊是面部鼻旁，這個部位，醫書上名之曰人王部。如果人王部痧點透齊，即使身上少見。却也不妨，所以在這個時候，做醫生的，應該設法透出面部的痧點爲唯一的先務，方如左：</p>
<p>葛根錢半建曲錢半大腹皮三錢炒扁衣三錢雲苓三錢無價散一分冲炙麻黃三分荷蒂六只</p>
<p>藥方加減法有積加查炭三錢。有汁去麻黃，外用芫　菜泡湯　熨，準兩旁，常使病孩面部色澤發紅僞度，惟薰熨時只可熨不可揩擦，因小兒肌膚嫩　，揩擦則表皮易破，以新毛巾絞乾，熱熨，則爲效最良。服藥之後，如果瀉止，微汗蒸蒸，面部紅點透齊，此時熱可退欽嗽多而爽，如此即是轉危爲安之象。</p>
<p>無價散說明</p>
<p>此藥上海普通藥號類多不備敝人平日需用此藥甚多所以極感不便於是按照古方重價配製此藥性質王道功擅透發凡痧子之隱沒不顯或一顯即沒以及風痧紅痧凡在見點時依法進服均著大效每分實洋五角服法另詳</p>
<p>痧子之順逆</p>
<p>痧子的順逆，最要留意，順的痧子，雖重不妨，醫者只要明白病理用藥因勢利導，可以平安就痊。這種順的痧子，如果找不到好醫生，還是不服藥為中醫，因為吃錯了藥，反而把順的弄成逆的。我平常遇到逆的痧子很多，會經留心考察他的來由，從誤藥而來的，十居六七，自然變壞的，十居三四，道種逆的痧子，做醫生的，使他轉爲順的，才算盡了資任：但是那種呌做順的，那種呌做逆的，順證如何對付，逆證如何挽救，都要說個明白，使得讀我這本小冊子的人，不致有絲毫模糊影響才好。</p>
<p>（一）氣急鼻扇痧子在初期的時候，咳嗽是不能免的，咳嗽不爽，痰不活。甚至咳得滿面緋紅，這都是極平常的見證，也是應有的見證，只要按照本書咳嗽項下的方子給他吃一二帖，就可以輕鬆了。若劇咳不已，發見氣急鼻扇，那就吃緊了，這種氣急鼻扇，就是痧子初期的一個逆證，試問這個氣急鼻扇，對於病孩究有什麽重大關係呢？須知氣急鼻扇：就是肺部的支氣管發炎的見證，簡言之，即是轉屬肺炎了，所以一見氣急鼻扇，就應該延醫診治，或配服下方，服後可使咳爽，痰活，咳嗽，爽快了，氣就不急了，鼻也不扇了，方如下：下文尚有痧子『熱向裏攻」「痧邪下陷」『痧後遺留證』如百日欬牙疳痧毒痧子調護法各節均有詳細病狀與治療法限於篇幅恕不備錄讀者欲知其詳請向三馬路千頃堂五馬路山東路中醫書局四馬路陳萬生堂購閱單行本</p>

<h3 id="c19">演變中之國際 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>國際情勢，無瞬息而滯留於靜態之中。由心言之，情感張弛，意念移轉；由物言之，環境利害，力量消長；以每一單位之心與物交織，更以單位與單位之交織，於是而發酵而醞釀。醖釀或歸幻滅：如日前盛傳，美國總統羅斯福氏於去歲爲顧慮歐局，　求和平，曾邀的義國首相墨索里尼氏與德國元首希特勒氏，晤談於北大西洋之中立孤島，事不果行：又如昨日盛傳，德國當局在今春兩决示意於波蘭政府，合力進攻蘇聯，宰割其領域，亦不果行；類是者不知其凡幾。及醖釀由裏而表，遂至先後異觀，於是因其顯見之動態而日國際情勢演變矣。其實演變決非偶然，亦非突然；演變所至，決不以顯見者爲範圍，亦不以目前爲止境。就目前言之：英蘇二國組織反侵略集團，談判頓挫；德義日三國締結軍事同盟，交涉頓挫；是國際情勢中之演變，蓋非復數週前之舊觀；抑亦演變中之國際情勢，蓋猶有極可注意之演變前途焉。</p>
<p>英蘇關於組織反侵略集團之談判，德義日關於反共公的强化爲軍事同盟之交涉，二事各有其重心；然其成敗利鈍，互相影響，互爲因果，二事可作一事觀。原反共公的之成立，以國社主義之德意志與法西斯之義大利二國爲先；德義各有其抱負，要皆不滿於歐洲政治分野與經濟壁壘之現狀；乃沆瀣一氣，狼狽相濟。夫就德義政權之先天而論，與民治不相容；就其政權之對象而論，與共產不相容；祗以民治久爲歐人所奉爲金科玉律，而共產則嘗爲歐人所視爲毒蛇猛獸，於是擇反共爲共通之標榜。誠使在反共號召之下，摧毀蘇聯而宰割之，最爲振振有辭；顧乃蘇聯勵精圖治，整軍經武，數年之間，國本穩定，是「共」雖可反而蘇聯不可侮矣；於是乘瑕抵隙，移其鋒銳於民治之弱小。德義號稱反共，而事實上既望共却步，故世人雖不　於共產者，亦不復惑於其號召而多之；獨於其誅求弱小，共斥之爲侵略。世界大戰後之侵略，以日本爲先；日本得德義，既欣然於侵略之道不孤，復以爲中國不足一擊，終得鯨吞，而爲彼大陸政策之障者，其惟蘇聯；於是欣然追隨德義而加盟於反共公的。此三國公的之所由來，徒以侵略之臭味相投，非有他也。及最近之一年，德義有爲於歐陸，結怨愈衆，對蘇聯之敵視則愈弛；反之，日本在華消耗愈多，故對蘇聯之忌憚則愈甚。循日本之願望，固願與德義共勝蘇聯，顧非所語於今茲；在今茲，但願得德義牽制蘇聯而已。謂將反共公的强化爲專對蘇聯之軍事同盟條的，此在德義，豈有戰蘇之雄心，今茲之日本，亦豈有戰蘇之餘力；故居今茲而結對蘇之軍事盟的，實際上三國皆無此需要也。萬一之需要，其惟日本；蓋蘇聯萬一參戰於遠東，則日本當然渴望德義攻蘇聯於其西陲。雖然，德義何爲受軍的拘束，而爲日本以戰蘇聯乎？循德義之願望，以其當前之勁敵，乃爲英法波土諸國，而非蘇聯；故雖無對英法波土作戰之決心，然以對內對外，既有騎虎難下之勢，則一旦以意外之接觸而開戰，則得日本爲友軍，自可稍壯聲勢，故最願與日本締結一般的軍事同盟。謂軍事同盟非專對蘇聯，實際可謂但望除去蘇聯而專對英法諸國。雖然，日本又何爲受軍的拘束，而爲德義以戰英法乎？簡單言之：三國結爲軍事同盟，各有所需，而所需者絕不一致。循德義而結一般軍的，則日本負有不必要之嚴重責任，蓋日本不必亦不利於戰英法也。循日本而結對蘇軍的，則德義負有不必要之嚴重責任，蓋德義不必亦不利於戰蘇聯也。抑日本今茲既無戰蘇餘力而猶許德義以締的對蘇者，是則至少在目前可以視爲外交上之搪塞辭令；况忌蘇憚蘇，何爲更締的以促進敵意耶！</p>
<p>抑其間不僅軍事關係而已。外交作用，亦復微妙之甚。德義於恣情侵略之餘，招致英法之崛起而謀組織反侵略集團。任何人深信雙方皆不願從事戰爭，亦任何人認爲戰爭之危機四伏。是以德義之拉攏日本，爲防備危機，自有其軍事上之價値；更就當前之外交言之，三國之一般軍的若能成立，則英法在遠東方面對日本既多所顧忌，必將因是而稍稍減輕其在歐洲方面對於德義之壓力，此德義期待者一。以日本牽制蘇聯之東陲，則蘇聯既有所顧忌，必將因是而稍稍鬆懈其對英法之接近，此德義所期待者又一。試觀日本表示不願締結一般軍的之後，英法色然以喜，是可反　德義對此之得失觀念矣。至於蘇聯方面，當然不甘坐視德國之東進北進，義國之寵大於南歐，故樂與英法成立反侵略集團，此誠不易之原則；然英法既予波蘭羅馬尼亞諸國以保障，則蘇聯所防德國之脅迫，在地理上已獲英法波羅爲之作壁壘；况德義茲已不復以蘇聯爲目標，則蘇聯自爲之計，又何必亟亟與英法結不解緣。不特如此而已，蘇聯與英法稍疎，足以稍稍消殺日本對於蘇聯所感之不安，亦即足以使日本稍稍鬆懈其對於德義之勾結。英俄談判之頓挫，固非蘇聯政策之變更，然在外交作用上固應若是觀也。</p>
<p>數星期前，國際形勢有愈逼愈緊之觀，友敵之辨，灼然對峙，今則以多方之演變，既不若數星期前之尖銳。然國際之矛盾，固依然存在也；今日之現象，非容滯留，非其止境也；前途更將如何演變，禍福利害隨之而殊，是爲國人所應注視，允外交當局所應洞察機微而善爲應付者也。</p>

<p>市場混亂　狀態嚴重</p>
<p>荳米行業市塲、於前晨復業後、一切交易、均依照公會限價辦理、昨晨九時開市之時、竟有人鉅量扒進、以致各號國米一律飛漲至最高限價、且有逾越限價者、當經市塲管理委員符前耕王天仇等、竭力勸導予以糾正、並鄭重聲明決照罰則嚴予處罰、決不寬貸、即第一次買賣居間三方每石各罰一元、第二次倍之、第三次再倍之、於是各項交易、仍在限價以內、市塲恐不正當交易再有發生、提早於十一時十分收市、但事態頗屬嚴重、市塲秩序混亂、而市上一般市民心理、又以米價有繼漲增高之勢、均紛紛訂購、切殷實而較富有之居民、則大量購儲、十石二十石不等、同時各米店門市零售、亦擁塞不堪、旋經各米店減少零　數量、一面　切勸告居民、以滬地存米豐足、訣無恐慌之虞、希望各界不必過事顧慮、引起紛擾市面、</p>

<p>市塲管理委員會及評價委員會、鑒於滬市存米尚豐、決不致發生缺乏恐慌、於情於理、米價決不致如此飛漲、此項不正當之飛漲、顯係有人操縱搗亂、若不予嚴辦、無法穩定米價、並使管委會無法執行限價、故當局會商決定、即日派員密查滬市存米貨主姓名、對囤積居奇投機操縱者、決呈報當局查辦、取締暗盤交易、及業外人投機操縱、切實執行限價、依照規定罰則處嚴</p>
<p>大量吸收　週轉困難</p>
<p>昨向市塲探悉、滬市存米、據最近之調查、約六十萬包上下、尚稱充足、不致發生恐慌、且實際上仍不止此數、當足敷三四個月之民食供給、惟該項存米、其中三分之二、均在非同業之銀錢業及有資力之棧房手中、不肯放出、居奇壟斷、同時蘇州同里八拆等幫、雖持有存米、亦不允出售、以致市塲現貨頭寸短少、買賣週轉、自覺困難、且該項有資力者竟不顧滬市四百馀萬市民之民食、祗求個人牟利、不但不肯放出、且再大量收進、致造成現在之局面、當爲最大原因、至內地來源雖感困難、如無投機者操縱、則滬市米價、當不致如是之嚴重、</p>

<h3 id="c67">滬關貿易雖漸恢復　入超數字驚人　政府努力消除入超之際　此全滬人士所應慚悔者 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>上海因其地位之優勝、交通之便利、工業得以日臻茂盛、遂成全國貿易之中心、經濟之樞紐、為遠東唯一大埠、戰後金融及貿易重心內移、以致曾一度衰落、今已逐漸恢復舊觀、惟入超特增、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>上海為全　國之中心</p>
<p>自民國元年以來、進出口貿易總額、由國幣三萬萬元、　升至十餘萬萬元、佔全國貿易總額之比例、常在百分之五十以上、進口在民國八年以前、大致佔全國百分之一二以至一八、民國九年以至十六年、自後逐年增加、而以二十五年之百分之五八·九六為最高率、出口自民元以至八年、大致佔百分之四十以上、自後乃減為百分之三〇左右、以至二十二年以後、又復增至百分之五〇、</p>
<p>戰後內移　貿易衰落</p>
<p>民國二十六年進口、為五萬一千零八十一萬一千元、佔百分之五三·四二、出口為四萬零四百六十七萬二千元、佔百分之四八·二五、如八一三事件茍無發生則進出口貿易再增四分之一、或可創民元以來之新紀錄、戰後因金融貿易重心之內移、曾一度衰落、旋即逐漸恢復舊觀、如二十七年進口為二萬七千四百八十九萬六千元、佔百分之三〇·七七、出口為二萬二千三百零三萬九千元、佔百分之二九·二〇、</p>
<p>滬關貿易　漸復舊觀</p>
<p>自去年第三季起、上海關貿易、即逐漸恢復舊觀、如今年之第一季進口一晚二千八百九十萬零九千元、佔百分之四六·九七、出口八千一百三十三萬一千元、佔百分之四一·八〇、比較去年之同季進口五千二百八十萬零五千元、佔百分之二二·九五、出口三千三百六十九萬八千元、佔百分之二五·一〇、則其進出口貿易增加、為一萬二千三百七十三萬七千元、足證滬關貿易逐漸恢復之中、</p>
<p>入超增加　滬人慚悔</p>
<p>上海係淪陷區域江海關被迫環境改懸「五色旗幟、稅收改存日商正金銀行、日籍關員之增加、於是中國政府有許多命令、上海之江海關、竟無法執行、消除入超之計劃、上海關亦不能實現、今貿易雖逐漸恢復、但入超數字、竟有增無減、如今年第一季入超為四千七百五十七萬八千元、較去年同季之一千九百十萬零七千元、竟增加二千八百四十七萬一千元、此為全滬人士所應慚悔者也、</p>
<p>進口洋貨　日佔第一</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向海關方面探悉、關於日本貨物之輸入、自去年五月份起、已躍登各國對華貿易之第一位、如今年之第一季為七千一百三十八萬八千元、較第二位之美國四千八百零一萬三千元、反增加二千三百三十七萬五千元、日貨之輸入、除華北各關外、均係由上海關進口、而非淪陷區西南各關日貨已絕跡、是項日貨係向淪陷區域傾銷者、其重要原因、為滬翌被　稅率被擅自修改、日貨進口、予以種種便利故也、</p>
<p>貿易轉好　商輪激增</p>
<p>滬關貿易漸告恢復、於是外商之商船往來、隨之激增、為全國各關之冠、如今年一月進出口為二八〇隻、一·一八一·四七八噸、二月進出口為二六〇隻、一·一八九·九九三噸、三月進出口為二九五隻、一·二六三·九〇一噸、今年第一季度共計八三五隻、三·六三九·三七二噸·惟往來之船隻、亦以日商輪船為最多、例如全國今年第一季往來船隻、日商一·五四五隻、二·五二六·三八七噸、佔各國之第一位、</p>

<p>然後進行「安全第一無肇事週」之佈置事宜而開始長時期之運動、俾使公共租界交通傷亡人數、爲之减少、該委員會各小組委員會已就擁擠之行人及車輛而研究上海之複雜交通問題、去年因交通肇事而喪生者計一六五人、較一九三六及三七年幾倍之、公共租界</p>
<p>面積大减</p>
<p>而人口較戰前幾增三倍、盈千纍萬之難民、自內地來滬、曾見電燈交通信號者、寥寥無幾、委員會今即遇此難題、蘇州河北岸之商業碼頭與倉庫、旣爲日方所佔、外灘遂成爲最重要之碼頭、而行駛於外灘之卡車、較前倍之、乃使局勢益趨嚴重、據貝克聲稱、一九三二年至三五年上海有亂時、警務處會敎導</p>
<p>公共租界</p>
<p>民衆、使知交通擁擠街道之危險、肇事乃見激减、故敎導新抵此間之居民、實屬必要、據執行委員會司庫浦林聲稱、工部局未予答覆前、不能公佈報吿書之詳則、但是項運動、將純粹爲敎導性質、</p>
<p>利用招貼</p>
<p>電影院及演講等爲媒介物、警務人員稱、彼等承認若行人不知如何可免被捕、則實行嚴格之交通法、亦屬無用、當局亦稱、以一切可能的方法隨時使民衆知悉大都市中交通之危險、彼等相信民衆將遵守交通規則、</p>

<p>— 周</p>
<p>林康侯先生，原名祖溍，上海市人，生於淸光緒二年，（西歷一八七五年）現年六十四歲。他服務社會，獻身金融界，久享盛名，現仟中華民國全國商會聯合會主席，兼上海市銀行業同業公會秘書長，中央銀行監事，國債基金管理委昌會委員兼秘書長，國際商會中國分會秘書長，國民政府建設委員會電氣公債基金保管委員會主任，中國紅十字會常務理事等職，兼任上海第一特區工部局敎育委員，市民聯合會主席，上海聖的翰，震旦，光華，各大學及中小學校董及主席校董，他受社會的推重，於此可知。</p>
<p>十九日的下午，記者往訪林氏於辦公處，他謙和的招呼我在他辦公桌的對面坐下。我驚奇着林先生的不老，因爲他雖然今年六十四歲，望去還不過四十多歲的樣子。他穿着西裝，精神煥發，胸前懸掛馬相老百歲紀念的壽字徽章，案頭的日歷上把每天的必要事務，紀載得很淸楚，可以見到他公務之忙，與律己之嚴。我們談了兩小時左右，他在不斷的電話中，答復人家許多事情，也可以看到他處事的敏捷。</p>
<p>訪問林先生，當然是耍談到金融問題的，我也何能例外。林先生始終是笑容滿面很和藹的他說金融是經濟的一部分，金融與經濟建設是聯繫的，建設發達，就是金融活潑，以現在經濟建設的突飛猛進，當然金融前途的發展，是可以斷定的。接着，他說到上海的銀行業情况，他說：在「八一三一前，上海各銀行的數目的爲一百家，加入同業公會，的計四十四家，自軍興以來，銀行業遭受非常時期的怒潮，本人當時感覺到的認爲凡是能够團結一體，其力量必可打破難關。在此大難當前，應該不問其會吾入會，悉予協助，不分彼此，患難與共，以有餘補不足，這才是互助精神的表現。當時承各方的同情，一致協力，得以在此非常時期造成上海銀行界空前未有之堅强壁壘，直至現在，各銀行依然取得聯環的互助，沒有一家有艱於應付之感，益足證凡百事業鞏固團結，實爲必耍。近來各銀號相繼設立，本人常以兩點以友誼的向其勗勉，第一顧全信用，第二不可投機，他並且說他於民國三年入銀行界服務，除承受主顧委託外，個人生平從未從事投機生涯，如買金子等等，所以至今二十餘年，幸尙爲各界所不棄。（未完）</p>

<p>— 我國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>增進伉儷間的愛情，就是保全家庭的和平，但要這樣，一定先要維持夫婦間性的調和，要是一方性機關發生異常狀態，不能使得一方滿足，那末夫婦間的愛情，就要漸漸冷淡，發生家庭間的不幸，託爾斯泰，維甯格等，都瞧不起肉欲，大唱禁欲主義，以為高尚，然到底不能普遍到常人的，古來雖亦有根著宗教上的信仰，和衛生上的顧慮，抑制發動，然本著倫理上和審美觀念，來禁欲的，實是很多，所以性慾是人類自然的生理要求，來固定男女兩性間的愛情，要是一方生殖機關發生疾病，或是異常，不能滿足對方；家庭生活上，必然要發生破綻，丈夫的放蕩，妻的歇斯底裡，離婚，姦通，殺傷等家庭悲劇，多是從性的生活異常或不調和而來，道學先生想拿道德和倫理來匡正他，那是一定不可能的，因精神上的原因而發生的精神異常，不拿精神療法，不能治愈；因性的生活異常或不調和而發生的家庭悲劇，也是這樣，不拿性的方法來救濟，不能成功，凡是從孤獨生活移動到結婚生活的青年男女，初次感到男女之愛，往往房事過度，損害心身的健康，男子發生性神經衰弱癥，女子發生子宮病和竭斯底裡等病癥；釀成家庭破裂的禍因，所以婚後縱欲，實是青年男女的一大危險，是可以稱他樂極生悲的由來，</p>
<p>還有，婚前自瀆新傷，則婚後必患早洩陽痿，神經衰弱等癥，脕近內分泌學進步，尤其青春線內分泌對於治療性神經衰弱一癥的成功，已達臨床應用之域了，例如患上述各癥，服以正真青春線裂劑男用「補體康」後，即覺病狀消失，年高者，可藉此藥力以增精補腎，廿四小時後即顯奇效，蓋此最為吾輩醫師所信任。其女用「補體康」功能調經種子，治乳癟貧血最為對症。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師述</p>
<p>淋病難題，在於如何消滅菌之根據地。現已為討論解決淋菌病之焦點。因淋菌一物，並不為一般人所僅著眼於透膜問題。或僅限於局部透膜殺菌的問題。及僅著意其表面之殺菌問題。而忘卻淋菌極容易繁殖徒眾的問題，逃竄之跳梁的頑固細菌，決難施以局部之撲滅，或僅消滅其寄存於粘膜上之淋菌，即認為已盡根治淋病之職責。實則未然。要根本解決此等頑固之淋病，必須採用廣泛的包圍殺菌療法，始克有效。而能合此種理想者，惟德國彼德博士發明之「克淋儂」一藥，是可證明之。</p>
<p>查「克淋儂」一藥，久已為各國醫家所重視，所以此藥口碑道載，聲譽卓著。蓋此劑所以為一般醫家病家所信仰者，因本劑系根據非特異性療法，採用蛋白體黃色素混合製成。經過二千數百次之動物試驗，復經過無數的各國淋病專家作臨床上的實驗，始底於成功。凡是急性淋時痛得要命之前後尿道炎，龜頭炎，包皮炎，膿血交流之膿液，及慢性攝護線炎，膀胱炎，關節炎等，服剋期根治。因服此藥後可數小時內發生抗淋噬菌作用，能將善於逃竄之淋菌，完全根本能解決而撲滅之，故功效十分可靠，根治一切白濁，絕對毫無問題。</p>

<h3 id="c110">僞造貨幣罪之適用法律問題 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 兪承修</p>
<p>（一）僞造貨幣罪可罰性之變遷</p>
<p>僞造貨幣，自唐以降，即有處罰之法，蓋造幣之權，操於國家，私鑄偽造，有妨國家之造幣權，故歷代刑法，均置專條，科以重刑。</p>
<p>民國以還，偽造貨幣，雖亦設有專章，然處罰之根據，視前已有所更易。全部刑罰法規之編制，自暫行新刑律以來，均以被害法益之種類，而定條文决序之先後，先之以侵害國家法益之罪，繼之以侵害社會法益之罪，而殿以侵害個人法益之罪，暫行律以迄現行刑法，偽造貨幣罪，均以爲侵害社會法益罪而居於侵害國家法益罪之决。蓋貨幣爲現代經濟生活中不可缺少者，經濟生產，以取得貨幣爲其目的，故貨幣實爲經濟生活之媒介，在國民經濟及交易安全之觀點上，立法之意義遂隨規定之地位而轉移。</p>
<p>由此以觀，僞造貨幣罪之處罰，究爲保護國家法益乎？抑爲保護社會法益乎？此種立法上之轉變，實値得吾人硏討。依余所信，犯罪之可罰性，並非一成不變，因社會之進化，潮流之嬗遞，時代之變遷，環境之更易，實不能墨守陳說，故步自封；同時，一個犯罪之行爲，未必僅僅侵害一種法益，卽如誣吿罪，依司法院最新之解釋，認爲一面侵害國家法益，同時亦侵害個人法益，欲明僞造貨幣罪之可罰性，必先明此二義。</p>
<p>在若干年前，僞造貨幣，雖以保護國民經濟及交易安全爲處罰之最大理由，然降至輓近，實不能不稍異舊說。中國現方在抗戰建國之過程中，諸凡人力，物力，財力，胥爲抗戰建國必要之因素，在積極方面，如何開發資源，充實經濟力量，固屬當前之重要問題，在消極方面，如何取締僞幣，安定金融，實亦上關國策，下關民生，雖吾人不能吾認僞造貨幣有關國民經濟，交易安全，然亦不能吾認偽造貨幣有關整個金融，建國前途。茍不以此言爲刺謬，則僞造貨幣罪，至少一面侵害國家法益，一面侵害社會法益；允以侵害國家法益較侵害社會法益，更堪矚目，初不僅專從造幣權一點着眼也。</p>
<p>（二）刑法上之偽造貨幣罪</p>
<p>僞造貨幣罪，現行刑法，規定於第十二章；全章凡六條。就行爲之類型以言：有（一）僞造，（二）變造，（三）减損分量，（四）行使，收集，交付偽造，變造及减損分量之貨幣，（五）製造，交付，收受供僞造，變造或减損分量之各　器械，原料。就保護之客體以言，有（一）貨幣，紙幣，銀行券。</p>
<p>我國向採銀本位制，以銀圓爲貨幣之單位，僞造銀幣，應搆成刑法上之僞造貨幣罪，本無問題；所成間題者，在銀幣收歸國有之後，僞造變造之行爲，是吾仍依刑法上之規定處罰，學者頗有爭論：有謂銀幣收歸國有之後，已失流通性，雖爲貨幣，並非通用，不備刑法規定之特別搆成要件；有謂法幣雖收歸國有，不過爲紙幣之祖保，並非實行紙幣政策，瞬止硬幣，在兌換期以內，政府且許通用，亦不能謂無流通性，其可罰性未嘗因以稍有變更。司法院二十五年院字第一五八二號解釋曰：「限制行使之銀幣，在兌換期間內，仍認爲刑法上之通用貨幣。」則似採折衷說者，蓋依此解釋，在兌換期間以內與兌換期問屆滿以後，極有出入也。</p>
<p>此外，尙有應加說明者：自民國二十四年十年十一月三日幣制改革令實施之後，明令以中央，中國及交通三銀行之鈔票爲法幣，法幣之爲紙幣毫無問題；三行以外銀行所發行之鈔票，性質上非法幣而爲銀行券，惟中國農民銀行發行之鈔票，於民國二十五年二月二十二日，經明定爲法幣，與中，中，交三行之鈔票同樣行使，故司法院二十七年院字第一八〇三號解釋，又謂：「中國農民銀行鈔票，旣經財政部核定，與法幣同樣使用，如僞造該行鈔票，卽係僞造紙幣。」此亦不可不知者。</p>
<p>（三）偽造貨幣之特別刑法</p>
<p>僞造貨幣罪，刑法上雖有處罰之規定，然尙有特別法令，不能不加以申說：</p>
<p>刑法上僞造貨幣罪行爲之類型，前已言之，就其規定而論，運輸銀幣出洋，不在處罰之列，依罪刑法定主義之結果，當然不能論罪科刑。然曩年美國對於白銀政策，極爲重視，一再提高銀價，當此國外銀價高於國內之時，奸宄之輩，唯利是圖，頗多偷運出洋者；甚爲喪心病在，勾結浪人，倚賴特殊勢力，以圖一己之私利，其有害於銀幣、極爲明顯，故經財政部提經行政院決議，偷運銀幣類出洋，或前往不行使銀本位幣地方之人犯，一律依照危害民國緊急治罪法，分別情節，從嚴科處；復經行政院函送中央政治會議第四五八决會議通過，送由國民政府，於民國二十四年五月二十八日，以密字第三八號訓令，令由司法院分別轉飭司法行政部及最高法院遵照，此爲新刑法施行後僞造貨幣罪特別刑事法令之一。</p>
<p>雖然：私運銀幣類出洋，依危害民國緊急治罪法處斷不過爲一時權宜處置，嚴格而論：命令旣不能變更法律，罪刑又不許比附援引，故國民政府復於民國二十四年七月十五日公布妨害國幣懲治暫行條例，全文都七條，卽所以應時勢所需求，以補刑法之不足。處罰之行爲，私運出口之外，並包括銷燬及减損分量在內；保護之客體，銀幣之外，並似括中央造幣廠之廠條在內。揆其實際，無非就前述國民政府命令之適用範圍，擴而充之，益求完備而已。</p>
<p>妨害國幣懲治暫行條例，施行期間，原定二年（第六條），嗣經國民政府明令，於民國二十六年七月十五日起，延展二年、依此計算，應至木年七月十五日，方始屆滿。同時，在延展之初，將條文略加修改，分別言之，的如下述：</p>
<p>（一）意圖供行使之用，而僞造變造幣券者，特設專條，處以無期徒刑，或五年以上有期徒刑，得併科五千元以下罰金。其意圖供行使之用，而收集僞造變造之幣券者，亦同。此爲舊法所無，新法增設者。所謂幣券，依司法院二十七年院字第一七六九號「妨害國幣懲治暫行條例所稱僞造變造之幣券，包括銀幣，鎳幣，銀行券在內」之解釋，其處罰之行爲與保護之客體，實與刑法之所規定者相等。</p>
<p>（二）私運及銷燬，原以銀幣及中央迭幣廠之廠條爲限，新法則並銅幣而包括在內。蓋新法修正之時，正在七七事變之後，抗戰建國，業已展其序幕，銅幣在經濟上之價値，雖遜於銀幣，鎳幣，然銅爲兵工器村及機件之重要原料，銷燬銅幣，私運出口，影響於軍事前途者綦巨，故亦使同受刑事制裁，此與事後禁止制錢出口之意向相同，不過制錢非貨幣，亦非輔幣，不能於此併爲規定耳。</p>
<p>就新舊妨害國幣懲治條例之條文比較觀察，雖同爲僞造貨幣罪之特別法，然二者立法意趣大異：蓋舊法純粹爲補充的規定，而新法則並爲加重的規定，故就條文之內容，修正之時間上揣摩，亦可證僞造貨幣罪，不僅爲侵害社會法益已也。</p>
<p>（四）結論</p>
<p>在適用法律之際，有一最大之原則，卽特別法優先於普通法而適用是也。妨害國幣懲治暫行條例，旣爲刑法偽造貨幣罪之特別法，則遇有此等行爲，而爲暫行條例所明文規定者，當然應適用暫行條例論處。舊妨害國幣懲治暫行條例，不過爲補充之規定，在就其法規之性質上，雖有優先適用之效力，因其規定內容與刑法偽造貨幣罪不相衝突，故事實上不發生排除刑法僞造貨幣罪各條之適用問題，正所謂有優先之名，無優先之實。若修正後之妨害國幣懲治暫行條例，旣有加重之規定在內，則優先適用之效力一點，所關極巨，故遇有此等案件，即應排除刑法僞造貨幣罪各條之適用，而儘先依妨害國幣懲治暫行條例科處。</p>
<p>夫特別法之頒行，難非經常之典，然究其實際，或則補充普通法律之不備，或則適應時代之需求，有非常之事，當有非常之法。現在抗戰建國期內，備經艱苦，苟不嚴厲處罰僞幣，穩定法幣，安定金融，實足以影響全局，此妨害國幣懲治暫行條例之所以修正公布，延展施行期間，而勢所必行者也。</p>
<p>法律之施行，除屬地之特別法外，應有統一性，曩年法院組織法之分區施行，學者頗多訾議；妨害國幣懲治暫行條例，旣爲屬事之特別法，叉非歸軍法裁判，故全國法院，即應一體適用，似聞上海法院適用此項特別法之實例，尙不多覯，不知原因何在？亟望有以善其後也。</p>

<p>銀行界對於記名受款姓名之支票，非經由銀行代收，每多拒不付款，一般人習非成是，未有人發其覆者，本刊王效文君申論糾正，洵屬顚撲不破，不佞久蓄是疑，今因王君所論，特吐其梗，以資補充，倘亦論事不厭求詳，爲王君所引爲同調乎？</p>
<p>查票據法第一百二十一條規定支票應記載之事項，第四款爲「受款人之姓名及商號，」雖同條第二項有「未載受款人以執票人爲受款人」之例外規定，然原則上固須記明受款人之姓名或商號也，依第八條載</p>
<p>「欠缺本法所規定票據上應記事項之一老其票據爲無效，」如無此例外，且關支票效力，故在立法本旨，固明明以記載受款人姓名爲耍件無疑，若出票人根據票據法出票，其記名受款人，爲勢所必然，則凡屬支票，將非付銀行代收不可，烏乎可。</p>
<p>在銀行界此舉，爲恐負責仟乎？則依票據法第一百三十八條規定支票準用同法第六十八條之結果，已明白有「執票人是吾本人不負認定之責之規定，何再庸其過慮，爲保護出票人或受款人利益乎？則票據法第一百三十四條已有普通畫線支票（畫牛行綫二道）及特別畫線支票（平行線內載有銀業商號）之規定，出票人或受款人亦不患無預防地步，今對於記名受款人之支票，亦必須銀行代收，是不特與畫線支票毫無區別，且受款人如無銀行往來，執此成感不便，深望銀行界急於改正，以暢支票之流通也。</p>

<p>— 兪鍾駱</p>
<p>提存法自民國二十六年一月七日公布施行後，於本市因租賃關係而發生業主拒收租金之事件，適用獨多，被壓迫之承租人受惠不淺，惟就實際情形觀察，法院對於提存事件，似有朱能認識立法之本旨，而涉及法外之繁瑣者，例述如左：</p>
<p>承租人某甲因出租人拒收房金，面囑邋栘，相持未決，恐出租人藉口其欠租而訴請遷讓，乃依提存法未公布前之一般習慣，將應付租金用『某某戶之租金』名義向銀行存儲。繼聞人言，必依提存法向法院爲提存，始生淸償效力，遂改向法院索得提存書及提存通知書，依式塡載以進，而法院不即依提存法爲應吾提存之認定，諭候書面通知。越數日，得一刻版式之通知書略稱：『該項提存書所述出租人拒絕收租一節，是吾實在，合函通知仰該提存人迅另具狀釋明原因，並提出相當證件，以憑核辦。』某甲未習辭訟，不知所謂『釋明原因』之書狀應如何執筆，又覺對於『拒絕收租之證件』甚難求得，自不得不商請業律師者爲之辦理。迨具狀後，又得一定式通知，命於某日某時將應提存之金額携赴法院提存，及期，如時而往，則僅由法院另付與一證明文件，矚其自向中央信託局繳款取據。再憑信託局之收據回向法院，換得載明提存物已經收受之提存書，計自請爲提存之日起，至提存程序完畢止，爲時竟逾兩星期之久，而兩决收受通知書，一紙書狀，所費固屬額外支出其委請律帥撰狀酬金，及本人先後赴法院及中央信託局之勞費尙未及計。問其提存之標的，則不過租金一十餘元耳，其繁瑣不便，提存人於費時，損財之餘，眞覺多一事不如少一事之爲愈也。</p>
<p>上述事例，見之於本市特一區之地方法院，並爲筆者所親見，其他法院即無同樣情形，雖尙無所聞，然以院發兩决通知俱屬刻版定式觀之，則其辦法之繁瑣，非因某甲之提存事件特殊而使然，並已形成此類事件必經之程序，似可斷言。提存非訟事也，其提存之原因，於法亦禾嘗責提存人以舉證釋明；今乃命以另具訴訟用之書狀，釋明原因，並附證件，按之提存法及其施行細則均嫌無據，而於接受書狀證件，認爲應予提存之後，不即以證明文件送達，提存人使逕赴指定之處所交付提存物，而必依指定日時到院請領證明文件，再遵指示辦理，轉折再三更非所以便民。是提存辦法之實施，應如何求其簡捷，司法當局應有以注意改善之！</p>

<p>合夥人之退夥，除依法向他合夥人聲明外，但若以退夥事實對抗第三人，則尙須有使第三人得知其退夥之機會，（如登報聲明等方法）始足以資對抗。（民二十七年度滬上字第九三號）</p>

<p>（答）上海兩特區法院判決成案，均認滙劃不能與法幣通用，則甲爲有理由惟就安定金融之旨趣而言，非無討論餘地，聞此問題，近已由某機關呈請司法院予以解釋云。（同）</p>

<h3 id="c116">要求的止境 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>要求無止境。</p>
<p>以國際事件言之：德國要求歸併蘇台德區域，予以滿足後，就要求整個捷克的瓜分：不予阻止，等她如願以償後，她父要求米美爾的收回；予以滿足後，她現在又在要求但澤的佔領了。假使但澤果然給了她，又將如何呢？顯然，她的要求還有不少：要求返還殖民地；要求退還歐戰後的賠款；要求……就將層出不窮，續續而來。要求無止境。</p>
<p>以地方事件言之：某方要求某種權利，予以滿足後，又要求某種取締；酌予辦到後，牠又提出別種要求：委曲求全，終不能得到諒解，要求之來，甚至達到了根本問題，關於整個地方前途的問題。自然，這樣的要求，也是會擴大開來，甚至超出地方事件的範圍的。要求無止境。</p>
<p>然而天下事果眞沒有辦法麽？倒也不見得，辦法總還是有的。換言之，要求到底總還是有止境的。</p>
<p>美國總統的「詢問一，雖然措辭和氣，並非恐嚇，被詢問者雖然表示看不起這個詢問，而椰揄備至，可是被詢問者的兇燄，却就此挫了下去，不敢再肆無忌憚；同樣，英國政府的頒行徵兵制，也使要求者不敢輕舉妄動，輒以干戈相見爲威脅。要求不自動停止，就這樣使牠停止。要求有了止境。</p>
<p>假使說，在德國要求歸併蘇台德區的時候，美國就有那樣的「詢問」，出來說一句話，英國就有那樣的決心，以徵兵爲維持弱小的後盾，德國會不會冉有以後的種種要求呢？這當然很難說。然而以後雖然仍不免於耍求，總也不會就要求得成爲現在的局面吧。</p>
<p>所以我想，一要求之來，決不可單單看那耍求的本身，似乎可以答應，便予以答應，以致要求者的胃口越吃越大；總要看看這要求答應以後的結果。並且即使在答應一二要求，也當時時設法，使之不再有要求才是。否則要求的確就無止境。</p>

<p>— 汪靑</p>
<p>破曉時候，天上稀疏的還掛着幾顆淡黃色的晨星，大地被一層薄霧籠罩住，四周只有不淸楚的房屋和街道的輪廓；人們尙在溫暖的好夢裹，等待一個巨大的響聲來把他們喚醒。</p>
<p>一個靑年沉着而帶有堅決的脚步聲，在空氣裏盪漾開來。面孔沉沒在霧氣裏，他在一個開着的大門前站住了，對牆上望了一眼，牆的兩面各有紅色的「爭鬭」兩個大字。他毫不遲疑地想舉足跨進門去，突然門內出現了一個白鬚髮的老人，用手攔阻了他，明朗的字句從老人口內吐了出來。</p>
<p>『喂！你來做什麽？』</p>
<p>『我要入這爭鬭之門。』聲音似無波的海一樣的平和，沉着，一個字一個字斷續的說着，『去爭鬭！』</p>
<p>老人的面目很莊嚴：『每天不知道有多少人到這裹來，但有很多的是進去了又回出來，……』</p>
<p>『不，我不會再回出來，除非我得到了我所要求的東西以後：我是抱了最大的決心到這裏來的。』</p>
<p>『你要的是什麽呢？是不是像他們一樣耍在這「爭鬭裏得着生存和解放？』</p>
<p>「是的，我要的就是這個。我們被人家欺侮得太够了，我們需要猛省，以牙還牙。他們以前不承認我們，但如今有新的生命了，起來爭鬭了。』</p>
<p>『爭鬭，你要知道這不是隨口說說的；你探顯進來看看，這裏，呵！這裏！這裹只有死亡。』說着老人便讓開了身子。</p>
<p>他探頭進去一看，裏面地上全是鮮紅的以及紫黑的血，東一堆西一堆的是白；更有慘呼聲，詛咒聲，憤怒聲打成一片，很覺得陰慘怕人。而他却不怕，不，他已望見這後面的光明了。他史堅決更沉着的說：</p>
<p>『死亡和流血並不使我心寒，爲了求生存解放，死亡流血乃是必須的，我早把這丟開了。』</p>
<p>『死亡和流血不使你顧慮，但是你回過頭去看看。你家裏的母親，弟妹，愛人，他們在焦急的等你回去，給你撫慰，給你愛：還有那醉人的音樂，濃郁的葡萄酒，牠們也在等你去享受呢。這一切又是多麽的可愛呢，還是回到那裏去罷。』『享受嗎？事受現在已不是時候了，讓那些東西去腐爛罷。至於我的親人呢，我想他們不久也要到這爭鬭之門內來了，爲了他們的生存和解放。更爲了愛，讓一切的愛在這爭鬭之門內生長起來。』</p>
<p>聽了這激動的言語，老人面上閃起了希有的光彩，微笑着顫抖而又激昂的說：</p>
<p>『靑年，進來罷！我預祝你勝利，而且我永遠的祝福着你，願你成功。』</p>
<p>那靑年感動地跨進了爭鬭之門，向裏面望去，突然那陰慘的一切都化爲烏有了，遍地都開着血的花，似乎在點頭對他微笑。</p>
<p>他又抬頭：光明正在前面升起來了。</p>

<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>死，本來有重於泰山輕於鴻毛之分的。所謂重於泰山，不外乎「殺身成仁」「舍生取義；惟其能如此而死，則其名垂史册，可與日月爭光，天地同壽，雖死猶生，此共所以謂重於泰山也</p>
<p>但成仁取義，似乎也應有一過程。就是說：應殺身而殺身，纔可呌做成仁；應舍生而舍生，纔可呌做取義。若貿貿然殺身舍生，這就未必可謂達到成仁取義的目的。孟子裹有兩個故事，說明這一件事，我先把牠引在下面：</p>
<p>會子居武城，有越寇，或曰：「寇至，盍去諸！」曰：「無寓人於我室，毀傷其薪木。」寇退，則曰：「修我牆屋，我將反。」寇退，會子反。左右日：「待先生如此其忠且敬也，寇至，則先去，以爲民望；寇退則反，殆於不可。」沈猶行曰：「是非爾所知也。昔沈猶有負芻之禍，從先生者七十人，未有與焉。」子思居於衛，有齊寇，或曰：「寇至，盍去諸！」子思曰：「如伋去，君誰與守？」孟子曰：「會子子思同道。會子，師也，父兄也；子思，臣也，微也。會子子思，易地則皆然。」</p>
<p>道是說，爲師與爲臣不同，所以寇至，一則得去，一則不得去。因爲會子只爲人師，手無寸鐵，即使殺身舍生，也未必可謂成仁取義。子思身爲大臣，自應爲國忘身，雖至殺身舍生，總能成爲成仁取義。所以孟子批評他們，以爲會子子思，其道實同，如果變換環境，兩人都能如此</p>
<p>或者要說：這樣說來，只有做大臣的殺身舍生，可以成仁取義；做細民的，即使殺身舍生＼，也未爲成仁取義了。但這話並非如是。諸葛亮在後出師表中有云：「鞠躬盡瘁死而後已。」文天祥在自贊中有云：「惟其義盡，所以仁至。」這兩個「盡」字，實在値得我們注意。這盡字無異指示人以積極的意思，我們必須積極爲國努力，而至於竭盡其力之後，方才可以一死了之。在未竭盡其力以前，我們實不用死，也是不可死的。文天祥與元相博羅辯答，有一段很可爲我們作注解。原文如此：</p>
<p>博羅云：「且道古時曾有人臣，將宗廟城郭土地分付與別國人了，又逃走去，有此人吾？」予（指天祥）曰。。「奉國與人，是賣國之臣也。賣國者，有所利而爲之。我前日除宰相不拜，奉使伯顏軍前，尋被拘執。已而有賊臣者獻國。國亡，我本當死，所以不死者，以度宗皇帝二子在浙東，老母在廣，故爲去之耳。」……又曰：你立二王，做得甚功勞？」予曰：「國家不幸喪亡，予立君以存宗廟，存一日，則臣子盡一日之責，何功勞之有？」曰：「旣知做不得，何必做？」曰：「人臣事君，如子事父，父不幸有疾，雖明知不可爲，豈有不下藥之理，盡吾心焉。今日文天祥在此，有死而已，何必多言！」</p>
<p>所謂當死而所以不死，乃因尙可立君以存國家；所謂既知做不得而必做，乃因國家存在一日，必盡爲臣一日之心。不能因國亡而即存消極之念，不能因事不可爲而即失積極之心，必至心力俱盡，然後一死。此所謂「當死不死，可爲即爲；眞不可爲，則惟死爾。」（元許有壬文丞相傳序語）這樣的死，纔是光明磊落，浩氣長存，重於泰山，而値得我們歌頌。</p>
<p>今日的中國，正處於堅苦抗戰的時代，也必須人人能存這樣積極的觀念，以國家民族爲至上，以軍事勝利爲第一，矢志靡它，堅持到底，則抗戰自能必勝，建國自能必成。所謂當死不死，有爲即爲，明知環境困難，工作非易，何如跳出這個環境，去到有利塲所，奮鬥工作。萬不能略存消極之念，以殺身爲勇敢，以舍生爲正義。此種得不償失，旣無補於自身，也無益於國族，徒作無謂的犧牲，只可認爲懦弱的表示。因有感於報上所載不願出賣靈魂往往自盡的新聞，拉雜書此，以爲留居孤島的人士作進一步言。</p>

<h3 id="c125">本刊第二次座談記錄　平衡物價問題（續） <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>日期　四月十六日上午十時起</p>
<p>地點　本報五樓會議廳</p>
<p>程紹德：怎樣的平衡物價？應該從物價上漲的原因上，分別可能平衡和不可能平衡的二大類。像生產設備破壞，戰時貨運不暢苛捐雜稅增加，這些原因，決不能在最短期間可以解決的。上海物價的平衡大任，既在民間自己身上，如果對於可能想法消滅的高物價原因，而不去設法把他消滅。這是不能饒恕的事。譬如投機和操縱，或是人心對於物價前途的無謂殷憂，這些原因，不是不能消滅的，輿論界至少應盡些提倡的責任。</p>
<p>而且把統制分奢侈品和日用必需品，雖有一部份理由，但不是完全合理的。因為物價的上漲，有彼此因果關係，聯結在一起。雖則我們也該承認，日用必需的物價，有首先平衡的必要。不過我們得瞭解物價和整個社會經濟的關係。物價漲跌，都是以使社會經濟引起不安。所以平衡當前的物價，不僅是目前所必要，而且也是為將來所必要的。請各位回想回想社會經濟變動中不斷生產的經濟循環，那種盈虛榮辱的變動，都由物價的漲跌做先鋒的。物價飛漲到極點之後，其結果則為競爭生產，或從其他方面增加供給，及至供給激增；於是物價回跌，並因生產設備激增之後，也就不至於發生生產過剩。到那時必競爭貶價傾銷，以至各業相繼破產。戰時的中國，唯恐其生產不增加，及因客觀環境的限制，短期內決無立刻提高生產的可能，但因物價激增，往往有引起其他方面供給增高之可能。所以當前高物價的最後結果，不是有發生供給過剩的危險嗎？同時將來有發生國民經濟解體的危險。和界內最近飲食店之增加，與租地造屋之普遍的發展，等等，這對於戰事平定後之上海，有增加經濟恐慌之可能性。至於因物價上漲，而使民眾負擔增加，足以引起社會種種不安狀態，那尤應當設法解決了。國民節約消費固可減少需要，但對於日用必需品的節約，有其一定限度的消費節約，當然壓不住物價上漲的氣勢。此在國民購買力極度破產的場合，於整個的社會經濟有無限的隱憂。</p>
<p>當然，統制物價，決不是輕容易的事。但也非不可能的事。吾人先從可能方面著手，慢慢來設法解決，各種事體，不可顧慮太多，顧慮太多，則一步不能行了，請各位再想想在我國沒有實施法幣政策之前，誰會相信我們有實施這樣理想的幣制呢？但我們終於以毅力而完成了大業。現在要平衡物價，問題也只在看我們有沒有毅力。</p>
<p>當然：我們也得顧忌事實：像外來的原因，如日偽的苛征暴斂與日偽之統制貨物，最近北方來路之豆油價格飛漲，即其一例。這是有待於軍事上的解決之後。我們是無能為力的。匯價的暗市跌落，這問題太複雜了，雖則我們不能不注意如此，不過他現在大約不致有再跌的危險，所以他對於刺激物價上漲的作用，是為己成事實。我們的目的是穩定物價，不是貶抑物價，所以在穩定下的外匯暗市，在物價統制上的效果，已可謂不復發生支配關係。要將目前的物價，穩定下來。使他今後不再上漲。我們無論從那一點說：決不致使任何方面稍受其害。不過投機操縱的商人，今後不能希望得更多的不義收入；但是即就在目前的物價水準裏，他們已可享受很大的不義收入了。但要使當前的物價穩定，由輿論支持以外，最重要的還在各界的切實合作，和互相各自約束才可以。這是有望上海各業自動組織平衡物價的團體。比較無組織，而使物價在投機狀態下競爭上漲，總要好些。</p>
<p>潘仰堯：以本人兩度赴西南各地考察所得，覺得今日政府要平衡國內物價，第一應鼓勵內地民間多設工廠，尤其是日用品工業。第二應令各地方政府減免一切國貨商品的捐稅，及予商人以運輸上的種種利便。同時應鼓勵土貨外輸，採用以物易物的政策，俾內地供求可以調劑。最要者，尤其在民間協力進行自治統制。本人覺到金融機關，可充民間自治的樞紐。目前就可以扶助政府及民間辦理下面幾件事：</p>
<p>（一）應多設倉庫，使內地土產和外來土貨，由銀行用收買或抵押方式，積存倉庫，隨時作平價的賣賣，調劑盈虛，留貨物供需上的伸縮餘地。目的既在平價，不是營利。故不免發生損失。這種損失，政府較好應作適當的補償。這種平售，必需繼續進行，才有效力。如果是一時行之，則反予投機商人的方便。</p>
<p>（二）應辦理押匯和保險，以減輕廠商金融上的長期負擔。並免除種種意外的危險。中央信託局已負辦理貨險的業務。但規模還不夠大，不能普及一般工商界。至於押匯方面，如果銀錢業決定辦理押匯上同一的標準，對於平價工作，可信發生很大效果。比如相約對漲價的商品，以平準的標準價接受押匯，否則即一致拒絕接受。如對跌價的商品，也以準的標準價辦理押匯，不得低估其貨價。這樣，過漲的物價可以下降；過低的貨價，可以拾起。</p>
<p>（三）幫助運輸事業，或各行自行兼辦運輸機構，以利便貨運，並減輕構成高物價的要素。聞西南各行，多貨款與交通機關，添購車輛及製造戰力橡皮車，此大可取法。</p>
<p>（四）延攬專門人才，赴內地幫助工廠，及民間小工業，指導各種新的生產方法。使生產品不但能改進共質，且可增大其量。</p>
<p>這些辦法，都是從治本上著眼；至於應急方法：最好請民間各公團，聯合起來，組織平價委員會，大家宣誓不得自由抬高或壓低。首先共同決定一個最高和最低價的標準，各業在這搞低價問得自由伸縮，以共同監察的方法，禁止不能越過這個限度。如有越限者，即共同予以制裁。經同業以過半數的要求修改標準價時，則開會共議出個修正的新標準價，以資共同遵守。同時社會各界，又應負隨時監察之職。對於同業公會予以限制。輿論界尤應共同合作。對於違法的商家，在調查確實之後，公開發表。在法院亦承認其為合法行為。這種辦法，或可使物價有安定的希望。諸位專家以為然否？還請指正。</p>
<p>史惠康：目前上海的物價固然是很嚴重的問題，但內地的物價，（特別是工業品的物價）有的地方竟較上海貴到一倍甚至數倍，所以內地物價的嚴重性，恐也不下於上海。上海物價的高漲，主要的原因是由於外匯的緊縮，及生產的不足等等，但是戰後上海人口的突增，益形成上海物資相對的不足，也是促成上海物價騰貴的另一因素。上海物價騰貴的結果，使上海市民受到生活上嚴重的壓迫，這對於抗戰經濟當然有間接的影響；但是內地物價的騰貴，則是由於生產的不足，由於內地生產的不足固然會使內地的人民，也受到生活上的壓迫，但由此而影響於抗戰的，卻是直接的，所以我覺得目前內地的物價問題，其性質實際校上海為更嚴重，而亟待設法救濟。</p>
<p>但是我們能用什麽方法，可以做到一方面足以防止上海物價的上漲，而同時足以增加內地的生產，安定內地的物價呢？我以為最有效的辦法是促進上海工業的內遷。我認為目前上海的工業畸形的發展，非但不是上海市民之福，而且就對抗戰濟立場言，也不是良好的現象。因為（一）上海工業發展的結果，必難免與鄰近淪陷區發生市場的供需關係。上海工業對於淪陷區原料的需要，固然是促進淪陷區購買力，促進淪陷區經濟的發展；淪陷區經濟的發展，當然是便於日偽的統治；同時如上海工業對於淪陷區生物品的供給，固然不啻以物資敵，而且一方是減少對於上海本市及內地物資的供給。這樣上海工業生產的增加，非特不能使上海物價的平衡，而且益促使內地物價的騰貴。（二）上海工業發達的結果，無形中就有大量的人口被其吸收住，上海人口的集中，就是增加上海物資的消耗，因此促進上海物價的騰貴。上海工業的發達，既於上海本市的物價無補，而且客觀上反不利於對抗戰經濟，所以我主張上海工業應該內遷；因為上海工業內遷之後，不特（一）內地物資供給可以豐富，物價可以安定，而對抗戰經濟機構，也可以增加強力量；而且（二）上海工業內遷之後，則基於生產關係的人口，可以疏散到內地，上海人口的疏散，當然可以減少上海物資的需要，相對的可以抑低上海的物價。這一辦法，我認為固然值得積極提倡，但實行起來當然有很多困難。不過我們希望在上海的實業家，深切的瞭解目前中國民族的危機，爲了中國民族的前途，爲了中國民族資本家切身的利益，應該自動的來實行這一有意義的工作。我們特別希望上海的金融界，率先的領導，把運營在上海工商業的資金，運到內地去。</p>
<p>章午雲：依照過去經驗言，物價高漲時銀行放款常增加反之則減少，但在今日物價升漲情形之下，各銀行所做之押款，卻似乎並不十分需要銀錢業之幫忙，且銀錢業為謀自身放款之穩妥計，鑒於日下及壓做物價，似乎不易奏效，目下物價之漲，並非由於銀錢業放出多量籌碼，而由於本身供需之失調，與平時情狀殊不相同也。</p>
<p>孫禮榆：有人以為上海物價高漲時期，信用反見收縮，所以物價高漲的原因不在於通貨；但是我以為通貨膨脹是相對的，倘使通貨的數量仍舊，而購買對象的貨物減少，那末，通貨就會相對的過剩，發生物價高漲的現象，現在上海各銀行謹慎業務，押匯不多，的確是信用收縮現象，但是實際上國貨出產的減少，更在信用收縮以上，所以物價就被迫上漲；何況外匯結價的商品逐漸增加，例如華北的國貨，本來可以用法幣交易的，現在也須以一先令二辦士的偽幣結價，全體的物價安得不步步上昇。</p>
<p>聶光地：物價不致會無限上漲的。因為戰事前途有利，人心漸易穩定。過去囤積之風，一由於戰時生活的不習慣，又由於法幣的風浪較多。現在抗戰局勢愈趨光明，反映人民心理，覺得一切都有辦法，對於法幣的信仰更易提高，而囤積之風亦可逐漸減少。國難時間，大家應該羣策羣力，商人固然希望他們能自動的減低利潤，以濟民難，消費者也應該厲行節約，萬不可再浪費。舶來品能不用最好，不然也宜設法多用國貨替代。大家少用洋貨就可多出一筆外匯，無形中增加我國抗戰的力量，這點似乎值得注意。</p>
<p>章午雲：在長時期之下，物價與匯價，當然發生連繫關係，無容諱言，惟就過去二十餘月言，其連繫關係，可說尚不密切，與其謂物價跟匯價跑，毋甯謂物價跟供需關係跑，此乃由於人民對於法幣仍有堅強之信仰，大宗商品之賣買仍注意於供需方面，而不專門注意於幣值方面，實為一極可喜之現象，因此吾人可知物價之前途，與戰事有莫大關係，如戰事前途順利則生產與需要逐漸協調後，物價不致過分上漲，但如戰事不順利，更加上供需失需之重要分子，推波助瀾，雖統制亦不易奏效，故物價之問題，實為戰事大問題之一部份也。</p>
<p>程紹德：顧慮太多，則一事無成。學者們的聚談，固應多多發抒其反的一方面的見解，使計劃中的對策，可更少一些流弊。但正的一方面，也應多多的想方法才行。否則便成為悲觀論的集中，而不是建設意見的集中了。</p>
<p>不許工商界賺錢，果然不能辦到。但勸告工商界少賺點，不致會完全無效。因為這是道義責任，誰能說工商界裏的人，都是不道義的人？何況事實上，工商界裏也不乏道義之士。</p>
<p>現在最好的辦法，一方由同業公會決定一些標準價格，另一方面以與論督促各業遵守。則即有高價帶沽，至少已有若干牽繫，不致無限增漲，所以我總主張輿論界應首先提倡，如果同業公會能響應，那末輿論界至少已完成了第一步工作，所以我們應當積極提倡，請各業組織物價平衡委員會，限制不合理的上漲。彼此顧忌，對於物價多少總有點效果。</p>
<p>聶光地：同業公會就是有標準價格決定，甚至於通知會員，但沒有政治力量做背景，還是與具文一樣，毫無用處。</p>
<p>程紹德：是的，但輿論的力量，決不可少覰。如果大家以為辦不到，便把提倡的責任都放棄，那就無辦法。如果大家不管他是辦不到，或辦得到，而能不斷的提倡，在提倡中不斷的作建設性的研究，作建設性的建議，那末總有發生效果，或見之於實施的可能。</p>
<p>王海波：統制物價，在歐美有最高最低價格法，用途等級法，定量制度，減少居間業者，和獎勵金等等。但歐美是工業國，我們是農業國，實施的技術不可一概而論。我們必須依照物價飛漲的原因，對癥下藥。我在前面曾提出分析物價的三個標準，即依地，依時和依物。據此標準：依地，我們就定為上海，依時就定為現在。第三種依物，各國普通皆分為軍需和民需兩種。上海現已成消費商埠，而非軍需產地，故我們要討論的是民需品，民需物價一概統制，亦不可能，奢侈品可以不管牠，應在一般平民衣食關係最切的物品中擇優統制，業以調劑國民生活，更謀經濟社會之安定。管理物價，固應政府與人們雙方並進，不過一因上海情形特殊，二因政府的工具只是法律，而由人民自動的辦理，不但熟悉內幕情形，亦可減少民眾反感，易收效果。所以我主張側重推行民間自治的物價統制。統制方法，總不外（一）擴大輿論，並組織團體；（二）研究代用品；（三）厲行節約；（四）增加生產，厲行節約可以節流，增加生產可以開源。在上海，我們不能如意的增加生產以開源，但節流卻在我們的權力之中，所以我以為節約運動，更為重要。關於此各種方法，剛才王爾桐先生已有解釋，毋須我再述，不過我覺得還有一項補充，即加緊提倡國貨：這不是因為現在只有舶來品漲價而國貨不漲價，卻因用國貨至少另二種好處。第一國貨總比外貨便宜，第二用國貨有補於外匯基金。至於實行物價統制的時候，當然有許多技術上的困難，我們必須打破困難，分別進行。這方面的例子，如一，統計數字及帳目問題，這在各國各種物價隨時皆有精密翔實的統計；商家購買出售亦有可靠的會計薄記單據可稽，我國物價，平時既缺乏正確數字統計，而商家賬目，又千頭萬緒，不易稽考；此應注意者一；二，物品分類問題，外國物品卻能符合一定的標準，分類容易，我國複雜，分類困難。三，方法方面，如暴利稅如能轉嫁，在平民方面設想，還是用最高價格法為得宜。我想誰也不會反對。所以我們要研究者不是原理問題而是技術問題。如正確的物價統計數字如何獲得，漲落和統制的標準如何，有人操縱物價時則如何稽考，物品的分類如何，用何種方法統制，上海特殊環境的困難，應如何打破。凡此多屬於技術問題，而技術問題，實是統制物價的成敗所繫，我們必須分門別類抓著每個問題的核心，問題才能得到解決。</p>
<p>聶光地：輿論監督，對於囤積投機操縱居奇，多少可以發生一些力量。如欲促成各業之自治統制，更非賴輿論提倡不可。</p>
<p>李權時：國民能自動解約消費，投機操縱者便無用武之地。</p>
<p>孫禮榆：關於物價的自治統制問題，我決定應該與政府的統制政策相提並論。各種同業公會的自治統制在理論最易實行的辦法，並且環看各國的統制政策，也都認為這是最重要最切實的辦法；但是工商家經營工商的目的是在於追求利潤，要他們自己抑低價格，減少利潤，的確是無異於「與虎謀皮」，只要看現在許多商人發「國難財」的事實，就可以獲得明證。現在的各種同業公會非但不能阻止物價的上漲，火星反而推波助瀾抬高價格。但是我們決不因此否認同業公會在統制上的機能，如果運用得好，這的確是一種極好的手段，好像「火」一樣，可以取暖炊飯，但也可以燎原成災。現在日本的物價統制非常嚴厲，許多細小的商品，也由國家公定價格，不許逾限高漲，同時又調查庫存商品，限制商人居奇。這種辦法都是由各種同業公會執行的，駕輕就熟，較國家另設機關為佳。他們的同業公會在國家統制之下，的確對於物價的統制頗有貢獻。同時上海的米業公會，在工部局管理之下，也確實發揮極大的統制效果。所以只要政治權力機關能夠善用同業公會，牠確是一種極好的工具；反之，倘使不用權力，任同業公會自治統制，牠卻反而做了牟利商人們的獨佔機關。現在中國的政府權力，已經不能及於上海，上海的公認權力機關只有租借當局，所以我們要統制物價，非請求工部局發動權力不可。工部局即使不為中國抗戰的前途著想，但為維持租界的治安起見，這種措置也是必要的。</p>
<p>但是這種辦法，更有賴於輿論界的創導。以輿論的力量，促進各方的進行。現在上海一區，政府的力量，既不能完全逮到，民間自治統制的方法，尤希望市商會能負此重任。至於進行的步驟，則應從調查入手，並先分別商品的種類，以定平價政策的緩急。此鄙人所望於商會公會，自動進行，必要時，亦得由政府責成商會負責辦理。</p>
<p>王雨桐：統制物價在各國均不乏其例，尤以對外戰爭時，無不先從統制物價入手，例如Ａ，美國在歐戰時，係將海陸空及有關兵役方面之需要物資，集合計算，務使所有物料，儘先分配軍用，有餘始能分配私人，至分配私人之價格，亦由政府規定，不得任意抬高，其最高統制機關，為戰時產業局，即一般資金還貸借，亦須先經產業局之審核，Ｂ,德國在世界各國中，對於物價統制，以德國之經驗為最富，最近二十五年內，德國經過物價統制之階段凡四；（一）大戰時期，（二）一九三一－三二年度，（三）一九三四－三五年度，（四）一九三六年還，首尾兩期，與中間兩期絕對不同，前者以物價統制制度，代替供求法則，而後者之統制目的，在於籍政府之力量，恢復商業之自由流動，任令物價適合減低之購買力，Ｃ，意大利之物價統制，為各國中之最徹底者，一九三六年是月，意政府實施科學化之物價統制，以中央物價委員會為最高機關，下有各省各業聯合大會，其中各有關系份子為農夫，製造商工人·運輸商·批發及零售商。全體皆有代表列席，與政府各部代表，及法西斯黨部共同討論，對於組成物價之一切因素，皆能得澈底優先之報告，每種商品自農村或礦山時，以至運往工廠，再至倉庫·冷藏室·市場，直達最後消費者之手，均可逐層深切研究，Ｄ，日本於侵華戰事後，對於國內物價，向採自動的控制物價政策，但戰事擴大，國內物價之昂漲，漫無止境，此項政策，仍告失敗，乃於一九三八年四月，決議實施強迫統治制度，商工省當局組織中央與地方各府物價委員會，專司制定物價事務，綜合日本之物價統制方針，有如下列各點，（一）策劃節約消費，籍以調整物品之供求，以分配統制與物價統制兩種手段，翼有以抑制物價之騰勢，（二）增加生產計劃，（三）代用品之獎勵，（四）儲蓄之獎勵，以上各項或屬消極的，或屬積極的。並隨國情而異。</p>
<p>劉星晨：把問題縮小，比如只談房租問題，上海房價，現在顯在，房東操縱之下，工部局如出而規定一個公正的房價標準，對於民生方面，也不無裨益了。其次三房客租織聯合會以對抗一房東，也是一種辦法。</p>
<p>吳觀周：容許我也報告一些關於房租上的事。這不單是和我們這班職員的生活，有切身的利害關係。而且和上海的一般市民都有切身的關係，我們被二房東們已剝削到至矣極矣，但無從有呼籲的餘地。恰才劉先生提出這個問題，所以我大膽的把我所知的報告一些，如果各位先生主持一些正義，力量當然要大得多。二房東對於三房客的剝削，無微不至，他們決不怕大房東加租，而且還歡迎大房東加租，因為大房東加租一成，那末他便可向所有的三房客各加一成。如果有二個二房客，他就有二成的收入。同樣的：租界當局提高房捐，提高電燈費，提高水費，都是他們乘機敲詐的機會。</p>
<p>魏友裴：據說法院處理房租問題時，總比較能替住戶設想。如業主和二房東發生訴訟，推事總能顧及二房東的立場。如二房東和三房客訴訟，則三房客的困難，法院也總能多表示一些同情。不過上海的房租問題，根本在人口多過於房屋的分配，所以解決辦法簡直沒有。</p>

<p>— 陸善熾</p>
<p>一，凡有財產淪陷戰區，經查明並未毀損，但有一時無法處分，並行使所有權者，應另行表示，列為「戰區資產。」其業已查明毀損者，作為戰事損失。</p>
<p>二，戰前所發生之應收帳款，經證實無法收取者，列為戰事損失，其能否收取，未可證實，而其原因，由於債務人行踪不明者，經過兩年後，列為戰事損失。非由於債務人行蹤不明，而一時無法收取者，經查明後應另行表示，列為「戰前延收帳款。」</p>
<p>三，對於財產列入戰事損失之估價，以戰前最後之帳面價格為標準：其為固定資產而有折舊準備者，為存貨而有跌價準備者，及為應收帳款而有呆帳準備者，均應分別從原價中減除，以其餘額，列為損失。</p>
<p>四，對於「戰區資產」，仍應逐年開除折舊。對於「戰前延收帳款」，仍應逐年開除呆帳。</p>
<p>五，對於戰區財產之維持費，應作為各該年度之損失費。對於戰區財產之搬運費，應列為戰事損失。</p>
<p>六，凡是有戰區財產未經查明整理之事業，如經決算，結有盈餘，應全部提作戰事損失準備，不得派分股息。</p>
<p>七，對於戰事損失，經查明確定之後，應臨先以原有公積準備，為之彌補，彌補不足之額，列入當年應損貨計算。</p>
<p>八，關於公積準備彌補虧損之順位，應先以盈餘滾存及未分派盈餘，次以不指定用途之任寬公積，再次以指定用途而無對外契約關係之任意公積，最後為法定公積。</p>
<p>九，因以戰事損失列為損貨，致當年度發生虧損時，其虧損額，應在以後年度發生純益時，儘先彌補。</p>
<p>十，虧損額已超過資本總額二分之一者，仍應在可能範圍內，召集股東會，決定進行方針，及補救辦法。其因虧損過鉅，致形成財產不足抵償債務時，如其業務仍可進行，且前途顯有復興希望者，得準其取得債權人之同意諒解，暫時免予宣告破產。其業已陷於停頓，且前途顯無復興希望者，仍應宣告破產。</p>
<p>十一，召集股東會時，對於住址不明無法通知之股東權數，得暫作別談論。（此為對於股東會無法召集時之一種臨時救濟辦法。）</p>
<p>十二，股款有未繳足者，應在結有虧損時，一律開始催收，在一年內未能收取者，停止其股東之權利。斯時對於虧損額之計算，以是否超過催繳後實收股款總額（連以前收取者）三分之一為標準。如需要增減資本，對於欠繳股款部份，得依欠繳比例，合併為整股後計算。（本款為對於股東失權之一種臨時救濟辦法。齋依公司法規定，股款經二次催繳後，仍不來繳者，公司得宣告其股東之失權，並拍賣其股份。但事實上戰後股東流遷徙，不免有因不可抗力之事由，而不能如期繳納者，故為寬容計主張僅僅停止其股權之行使。惟斯時如需要增資或減資，則對於欠收之股款，自惟有先以合併股數方法，實行減資。）</p>
<p>十三，對於曾受戰事損失因而結有虧損之事業，在其虧損尚未彌補足額以前，如有盈餘，應請政府為「體卹商銀」並維護稅本起見，暫時免除其繳納所得稅之義務。但虧損一經彌補足額，即仍應照繳。（依所得稅法之規定，上年度之虧損，不得列入下年度計算，但此係就平時而言，若在戰時，工商業之受有損害者，已屬元氣大傷，且其虧損原因，亦非由於經營不良，政府自宜特別予以寬貸，俾可期其早日恢復。同時政府對於因戰事而獲得非常利得之事業，既有過分利得稅之徵收，則對於因戰事而成為虧損之事業，自亦應免其納稅，方稱公允。）</p>
<p>十四，為顧全公司及多數股東之資金周轉起見，雖在戰事虧損尚未彌補足額以前，如其虧損未達資本總額三分之一，得準其在結有盈餘之年，分派不超過週年五厘之股息，但對於股息所得之利息所得稅，仍應照納。（查公司法上對於需要長期經設之事業，原設有建設利息之辦法，故此處似不妨援用。）</p>
<p>以上辦法，俱係適用於目前戰事期間，而帶有消極性質，至於將來戰事平定之後，為謀整個工商業之復興繁榮起見，自尚應從積極方面，講求救濟辦法，如發行復興公債，舉行工商貸款等，皆有效之救濟辦法也。惟以其不涉於本文之範圍，暫置不論。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c130">勃谿夫妻怎樣變為恩愛 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>夫婦勃谿是人生最痛苦的。因為夫婦的結合，不外為下列幾個目的：（一）是滿足生理的要求；（二）日常生活的調濟；（三）學術與事業上的互助合作；（四）生男育女以冀生命的延續；（五）組織美滿家庭建設新社會的基礎。古人云：『天地萬物，莫不造端於夫婦。』誠然，全社會的夫婦，都能恩愛和睦，生男育女，建設康樂家庭。夫唱婦隨，共謀事業的推進，以負起社會國家以及時代所賦予的使命，這真是時代進步中的一匹馬力，優良社會中的一個新生細胞。果能如此，自然就國泰民安，日進無疆？</p>
<p>今一對夫婦而吵吵鬧鬧，或者打罵，或鬧離婚，則終日與冤家相對，不特人生是痛苦之至並牽一髮而動全身，社會國家以及民族，均將蒙受著不良的影響。</p>
<p>因為造物的奇妙，夫婦各因生理的需要，彼此恩恩愛愛，親親暱暱，這是很自然的。因為在他倆愛的生活中，既歡慰了自己。同時又歡慰了對方。何樂而不為，生男育女，那時當然的。他們既有愛的存在。為著共同的前途，於事業與學術上互助合作，有商有量，這更是不生問題的事，因為每個人都願意往天堂去，誰甘墮入地獄呢？</p>
<p>由此觀之，夫婦的所以勃谿？其中不由原因在。並其總原因，必為無愛情。夫婦何以無愛情？這據醫學上的論斷，必為在夫婦任何一方的身體上有缺陷之故。此種缺陷，並以男子為多。假使一個男子於早年犯有自凟與遺精，或荒淫縱欲與憂勞斷傷之故，在天賦機能上爆發著滑精漏精，早洩萎，精薄不育，神經衰弱等癥，則在生理關係上夫婦雖有其名而無其實，身心上既得不到歡慰，這怎能不使她惱恨呢？因此，愛情破裂，夫婦勃谿，或競演出其他種種的悲劇！</p>
<p>聰明丈夫欲化勃谿而為恩愛，唯一辦法，即在根本治愈其疾病，治療之法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最為對癥特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各癥完全治愈。并可收延年益壽之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效尤速。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>無論什麽事情，假如不從根本上著想。那是終究要失敗的，現在姑以婦女的的愛美來說吧。有許多女性，她們不從本身的健康上著想，而斷斷講究裝飾，這有什麽用呢？譬如一個很年輕的姑娘，她因為多病多痛，失去了健康，而將女性最可貴的特徵美喪失――乳峯萎癟。臀部瘦削，肌肉枯槁，則雖穿上極時髦的衣服，滿塗脂粉，也不過像一個帶皮骷髏，有何肉感動人的美態？況且現在男子們的眼光何等厲害！看女人動輒以曲線美為標準，如果曲線美喪失，那便嗤之以鼻，或報以冷酷的護美，所以這種女性在情場上爭逐，必然失敗！結果其命運亦必非常悲慘！欲謀補救，祗有自己徹底覺悟，服以世界名醫一致推薦的卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』，則服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，蓋此劑係由奧國醫聖斯丹那博士積三十餘年之艱苦實驗，由極壯健的雌性動物內，提取其卵巢精華，經過科學家複製而成，故藥性和平，功效偉大，不論嚴冬盛暑，均可常服，絕無副作用，如在萬物生長發育的春季里服用，則功效尤為顯著，舉凡婦科各病，均能在短期內根治全癒，助長發育，使乳峯逐漸高聳。臀部日見豐腴，紅潤面頰，增進健美。</p>

<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>遺精失青年人的通病，發現遺精之後，大都不以為憂，甚至以遺精為可喜。因為孩子的心理，每以仿傚成人的行為為樂，今知道自己成人了，這是使他心花怒放的。所以在春情發動期的青年，不有遺精，亦每以自凟而招致遺精那更比比皆是。</p>
<p>遺精而繼續頻繁，或遷延失治，勢必至病根深入，徵象惡化，由遺精而成滑精漏精者有之，有遺精至面黃肌瘦，腦力衰退弱，健忘失眠，腰酸背痛，發育不全，早洩陽痿，精薄不育等癥者真是多不勝計，這種病弱青年，雖年齡尚輕，而已暮氣沉沉，為學求裳，均不圖進取，蓋已無能為力了。就是在人生最低限度的夫婦生活上，亦必為妻不滿，夫婦間每演出悲劇，總之，未來的危機是不堪設想的！遺精的特效療法，在此時祗有連續服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，鎮靜神經，則夜間夢幻減少，可得安眠，遺精自然痊愈。惟因遺精已引起上述病象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生髮素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各癥完全治愈，並可收延年益壽之效。所以上述良藥，均為世界名醫所推崇，早已風行全球，口碑載道，各藥房均有代售了。</p>

<p>— 滬西法華鎭賈銘手啓</p>
<p>姚博士和詹醫師：爲了不願意做奴隸，爲了不願意長在都市裏過糜爛生活，於八一三後南市失陷前就舉家往西搬。因爲交通的阻梗，那知未到鎭江而南京失守了。廹不獲已，經轉輾繞道復由江北而重歸上海。因爲沿途所受風霜太甚，身體當然虧損。但又不願把可寳貴的光陰虚擲，一面入某校補習外國語，一面又担任某校教職，以冀教學相長，充實我的內在知能。這樣的做法，自己以爲在非常時期可算躊躇滿志。那知以前的遺精又復發了。初時每月二三次，大都因夢而遺。繼者無夢亦遺，每月幾至十餘次之多。人是血肉之軀，何能經此生命源泉的大量流失，因此，凡腦力衰弱，健忘失眠，腰酸背痛，早洩陽萎等症即相繼而來。在課程中的每一個問題，昔日可不加思索而應對如流。今者苦索不得，終至錯誤。日間神思惚恍，夜間淸醒難眠，余妻爲欲我得酣睡，履次用温情蜜意慰我，但都無效，因此，余妻由怨懟而生憎恨，大有要求離婚别居之意。同時，因精力之不濟，輟學而也失業了。此情此景，茫茫前途，余內心上之痛苦，簡直難以言喻！</p>
<p>否極泰來，救星之到也有出人意料者，在病中偶讀申報健康智識欄中先生等的大作。內稱腦衰腎虧各症，服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最爲對症特效。遺精症以服「希米脱氏固精片」爲最好。即囑余妻在中西大藥房中各購買一打，二者同時兼服，於一日夜間果覺精神爽快，症狀减輕一打服完，不特遺精不復發現。上述各症，亦完全痊愈，尤可貴者，腦力益見充足，精力格外豐富。因此，余妻笑謂余曰：我倆又新婚矣。然則前途光明之復現，豈非先生之所賜乎？用特奉函伸謝，并告同病。敬祝醫安！</p>

<h3 id="c134">難民生產品展覽會 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 飛雲</p>
<p>有棉織刺繡襪子毛巾　都是家庭實用的物品</p>
<p>上海難民救濟分會由五月五日起到十一日止，在文監師路（卽蓬路）第一收容所，舉辦了一個難民生產品展覽會。</p>
<p>會塲本來是收容所，也就是錢業會館，這裏面容納有男女難民一千多人。</p>
<p>據會中招待的人說：他們由上月份起，能够生產的難胞，才可以住在那裏，不管是出去自己做買賣，或是在收容所裏做工，總之，能够自作自給的難胞，才有資格住在收容所裏。</p>
<p>至於救濟分會爲什麽要在五月五日舉行這個展覽會，在他們特刊的開幕詞裏說：五月五日是全國生產會議，他們決定在生產建設運動裏，總動員起來。</p>
<p>但我以爲：在這個展覽裏，主要的是指出難胞在良好的指導下，他們的工作能力，是並不會比什麽人差的。</p>
<p>就以我個人看到的，展覽會裏陳列的各種棉織品，如綉花坐墊，手提包，花枕套，白布衫褲，白色手套，絨綫背心，短襪等，和國貨公司一般出品，並沒有多大兩樣，而他們的價錢却是那麼便宜。</p>
<p>以出品種類計，共計分棉織類，木工類，竹工類，黏土類，紙工，草織，及其他許多家用的東西</p>
<p>一進會塲門口，就是一個走廊，走廊兩邊，掛着彩色紙燈，兩邊還有玻璃橱，橱裏陳列着各種棉織，刺繡的出品，另外還有幾個模型，一個是「自衛而戰」，一是「自由的新中國」，還有一個全中國的港口，這些模型，雖不是十分精緻，但難胞們對於中國抗戰勝利的觀念，是可以看得出十分堅强的</p>
<p>展覽的會塲，是在整個建築的中心，那地方，本來是看戲的大天井，因爲正中還有着一個大戲台，而現在這戲台，也已改作難胞的住所了。</p>
<p>在玩具中問，也有飛機，大砲，及軍艦，雖然製造得並不如何精緻，但這些玩具，究竟也還是可以作爲兒童敎育玩具的。</p>
<p>會塲裏，還附帶地舉行着一個圖畫展，作者是吳小石君，作品並不如何成熟，但吳君早先原也是難胞，現在陳列作品賣來下的錢，據說是捐給難胞的。</p>
<p>難胞們，在會塲裏，也都彬彬有禮的，担任着糾察及招待，據說五日這一天，居然也賣到了四十幾塊錢。但是，以我看，會塲裏參觀的人並不怎麼多，我希望，歡喜選用國貨的太太小姐們，大可以到那裏選購一下許多實用品，一切毛巾，拖把，竹器，那裏都有。</p>
<p>臨走，順便在收容所裏參觀了一下，難胞們所睡的床鋪，都是竹頭搭起來的，而且分上下二層：收容所裏有完全小學一所：晚間並有婦女補習班及成人班。</p>
<p>所裏每天燒的飯，難胞們化三分錢，就可以買一磅，每天化六分錢，就可以有兩餐白飯了。</p>
<p>最後，把屈映光先生爲這决展覽會的題字，抄錄在這裏，作爲本文的結束：</p>
<p>烽烟遍地，溝壑餘生；</p>
<p>難胞慘運，創鉅痛生；</p>
<p>戰勝環境，雙手萬能；</p>
<p>自食共力，出品紛陳；</p>
<p>規模改進，效用日增；</p>
<p>十年生聚，建國必成！</p>

<p>第九回　含悲茹苦淚灑四廂　崇儉習勞體勤十畝</p>
<p>當時導演金先生便選定了她，扮演劇中的女主角湘子，可以算得勝任愉快。林小姐起初還不敢答應，因爲這戲劇演出，不知道裹面有什麽傷害她母親感情的地方。要知道林小姐很孝順她的母親，她母親自和林先生結婚以後，只生下她一個女兒。後來林先生又故世了，母女二人，相依爲命，她知道她母親的可憐，而這戲劇有一半和她的母親有些相像。萬一她母親心中有些不願意，林小姐是不肯扮演的。導演金先生說：『決沒有這事！就是在抗戰時代，兩國的國民，私交還是挺好的。何况現在戰爭已是過去的事了。倘若不信，請林小姐將劇本拿回府上去，請林太太過目，好在她對於中國文字很精通的。在公演之前，還要請她來指導一切咧。』林小姐回去，請命於母夫人，林太太對於劇本很滿意，教她女兒儘管去扮演就是了。因爲第一幕，便是湘子與陳君在東京就學時慕戀的情况。一切佈景，都是日本風俗，而湘子所穿衣服，也是日本打扮。要是別一位中國女學生，就是習練起來，也沒有如此純熟。可是林小姐不必習練，她從小就穿日本衣服的，自然舉止態度，十分瀟灑從容，一些兒不覺得勉强了。這位林小姐，她的名字喚做歸鴻，本來人極聰明，而且賦有演劇天才，男主角扮演陳君的，也是東吳大學文學院的一位高才生，他也到過日本的。這一本戲，看到悲哀之處，沒有一個人不垂淚的。何雙玉何儷玉兩位小姐，眼睛都腫了起來。坐在她們後面的兩位美國小姐，她們是也都會說中國話的，早已嗤通嗤通的出聲哭起來。吳君素只是擦眼鏡，剛戴上去的眼鏡，又卸下來擦了，不到兩分鑲，父取下來擦了。金澹雲輕輕的向吳君素說道：『你們爲什麽要編那種悲劇呢？敎人家看了心中難過。」朱愛人歎口氣道：『這就可以顯出當時侵略者的罪惡。一切和平，都被那班以殘害人類，爭奪相殺的人所破壊了。試想人類與人類，有什麽深仇宿恨，爲什麽要五相拼命，好像世界上有了我，便不能有你，現在想來，却是何苦呢？』（一〇四）</p>

<p>主演者是瓊裴納和賈克彭尼。賈克彭尼是和賈克奧凱有着同樣的一付老面皮的，所以「模特見遊巴黎」的故事是以賈克彭尼爲骨幹，而不是瓊裴納。</p>
<p>故事是這樣的：美國「藝術家與模特兒海外歌舞團」在巴黎上演，因營業淸淡，積欠房金甚巨，被店主下逐客令。團主爲布克鮑士威爾，計無所出，躑躅街頭，偶遇少女派特麗茜愛，因邀共加入歌舞班。女爲美國油業巨擘哈伯之掌珠，哈伯得女加入歌舞班之訊，頗爲震怒，至旅館交涉。適旅館主人召警察來，布克等踰窗逃出，避入美術館中。時美術館中正舉行女性藝術品展覽會，布克冒充俄國代表，率衆參加。會中有拿后的瑟芬之鑽練，哈伯因女深愛，而又遭館主拒絕出售，乃暗中竊去。時有荷商代表與哈伯簽訂出賈油田合同，布克因疑哈伯之行動詭異，將合同撕毀。及後鑽練發現，美領署亦證明哈伯確爲油商，同時油田漲價，哈伯深威布克撕毀合同，女亦與布克結爲夫婦。</p>
<p>由賈克彭尼來演那個團主布克，或許能使爲娛樂而娛樂的觀衆偶然打幾個哈哈。瓊裴納簡直是無戲可做。</p>
<p>在這樣一個故事，導演者也祇能儘最胡鬧一下完事，所謂打打吵吵，跳跳鬧鬧而已。卽是那塲萬衆矚目的模特兒表演，因爲織接的零亂，也不過做到了介紹各種最新式的服裝，爲這譯名的誘惑而去的觀衆，一定十分失望的。勉强可以提出來的還是團員被旅館主人下逐客令後，在街道上的一塲戲，相常熱鬧，情緒氣氛也濃厚。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Introduction <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>"Shazi" is a type of fever accompanied by a rash, most easily contracted by children under the age of ten. However, if the pathology of this disease is not understood, proper care is not taken, and pills and medicines are swallowed randomly, with no dietary restrictions, then the situation becomes dire. Therefore, when "shazi" is prevalent, we often hear news that a young boy in a certain family has died from "shazi," or that a young girl in another family is in critical condition due to "shazi," news that is tragic and frightening, one after another. People without medical knowledge already fear the three words "fa shazi" to the point of trembling. I am a pediatrician. I treat many childhood illnesses daily, and "shazi" is particularly prevalent among them. Therefore, I have relatively extensive experience with "shazi." Over the years, I have collected many specialized books on childhood diseases, conducted in-depth research, and combined and improved the reasons why doctors often fail to treat "shazi." Now, I fully understand the various symptoms and changes of "shazi," the methods to reverse the condition, and the methods to save those in danger. I know which cases are certain to be fatal and which cases, though dangerous, can still be saved. I am confident that as long as a child suffering from "shazi" has not been misdiagnosed with miscellaneous medications, I can cure ten out of ten cases. If misdiagnosed, the changes become endless. However, when those changes occur, if the family is willing to firmly trust and carefully accept my guidance and advice, I can still save six or seven out of ten severe cases. Currently, I see families with children in society who, once a child contracts "shazi," do not know whether the doctor's prescription is correct, nor do they know how to provide proper care, resulting in chaos and confusion. In other words, it is simply like a blind person riding a blind horse, wandering into a deep pond at midnight. Can you imagine how dangerous that is? In the end, the result is often death, which is truly tragic! Driven by compassion, I cannot bear to sit idly by. I am willing to write out the entire process of this disease, its changes, and the treatment methods in detail. I will tell the parents, so that everyone has this knowledge and can be prepared. While it may not be a treasure raft of salvation, it can certainly serve as an experienced guide. I sincerely hope that all readers will spend a very short amount of time and a small amount of effort to read this article from beginning to end. I guarantee that you will gain a lot of knowledge, so that when your own child contracts "shazi," you will not panic and be at a loss. This is my sincere intention.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Causes of "Shazi" <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Children can contract "shazi," and adults can also contract "shazi." Where does this "shazi" come from? According to medical books, it is congenital fetal toxins. When men and women conceive, the root cause is already planted. According to this, "shazi" is entirely an internal cause. However, smallpox also comes from fetal toxins, but each person only contracts it once, and vaccination can prevent it. If "shazi" is indeed a fetal toxin, why does it occur several times? Moreover, why does it not occur earlier or later, but only when "shazi" is prevalent? Therefore, I say that the statement that "shazi" is purely an internal cause is somewhat inaccurate. According to Western medicine, it is entirely due to microbial infection, with no internal cause. This statement is also not entirely reliable. Why? Consider the first patient at the beginning of a "shazi" epidemic. Who infected him? If you don't believe me, I can provide evidence. For example, the Zhang family has three children and two adults. One of them unfortunately contracts "shazi" during an epidemic. Then, the sickroom will inevitably be filled with germs in the air. According to our Chinese customs, when someone in the family is sick, regardless of whether it is an infectious disease or not, it is rare to isolate and treat them. Therefore, the family members freely enter and exit the sickroom and come into contact with the patient. Since this is the case, according to the theory, all five members of the Zhang family should inhale the germs and be infected. However, the reality tells us that this is not the case. Some are infected, and some are not. Then, the theory of purely microbial infection is fundamentally shaken. Therefore, "shazi" as purely an external cause is also not credible. According to my experience and careful consideration, I can determine that the cause of "shazi" requires both the internal cause of congenital fetal toxins, the external cause of inhaling germs, and the inducing cause of a new digestive disturbance. The inducing cause can be said to be the fuse. Thus, internal and external factors combine, and it ignites. Otherwise, one strand of thread cannot make a line, and "shazi" will definitely not occur.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Pathology of "Shazi" <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The cause of "shazi" has already been discussed above. However, there is a new discovery recently. During "shazi" epidemics, we often encounter children who have never had "shazi" developing fever and chills. According to the theory, since they have congenital fetal toxins, are exposed to germs in the air, and have a new digestive disturbance, they should contract "shazi." However, the reality is that some children's fever and chills are resolved immediately with a single dose of relieving medicine, so many do not develop "shazi." Therefore, I know that the conditions for developing "shazi," in addition to the three mentioned above, also require persistent fever and chills, and stagnation for several days. Then, "shazi" will inevitably occur. Therefore, if we can use appropriate medicine at the beginning of the illness and pay attention to the child's diet, warmth, and cold, we can sometimes avoid it. Isn't this a very gratifying insight? The onset of "shazi" must be accompanied by an external infection, and the external infection must not be resolved and must stagnate for several days before "shazi" develops. Therefore, I say that "shazi" is a feverish disease that causes "shazi," which is entirely correct. Since it is a feverish disease, and feverish diseases fall within the scope of "shanghan" (typhoid fever), then the method of treating "shazi" should naturally be based on the prescriptions in "shanghan."</p>
<h3 id="e4">Symptoms Before "Shazi" <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(A) Coughing: Coughing is the step before "shazi." The subsequent symptoms are nasal congestion, sneezing, runny nose, yawning, and tear-filled eyes. These symptoms are similar to a common cold. At this time, the following prescription can be taken:</p>
<p>Stir-fried Saposhnikovia divaricata (fang feng) 4g</p>
<p>Apricot kernel (xing ren) 12g</p>
<p>Pinellia ternata (qian hu) 6g</p>
<p>Fritillaria thunbergii (xiang bei) 12g</p>
<p>Citrus reticulata (du ju hong) 6g</p>
<p>Stir-fried Perilla frutescens (su zi) 12g</p>
<p>Mulberry leaf (sang ye) 12g</p>
<p>Modifications: If the patient has a greasy and thick tongue coating, no appetite, it indicates food retention, add Stir-fried Crataegus pinnatifida (shan zha tan) 12g Stir-fried Hordeum vulgare germinatus (jiao mai ya) 12g to the prescription. If the urine is scanty, reddish, or white like rice water, it indicates heat in the bladder, add Poria cocos rubra (chi fu ling) 12g Poria cocos alba (bai fu ling) 12g Plantago asiatica (geng tong) 4g to the prescription.</p>
<p>(B) Fever: When the cough first starts, the body is not yet feverish. After two or three days, the cough worsens. The most severe cough is completely unproductive and continuous. After half a day or a day, shortness of breath, nasal flaring, fever, and vomiting appear. Why does shortness of breath and nasal flaring occur? Because of the cough. Why does severe coughing cause shortness of breath and nasal flaring? Because the continuous and severe coughing causes the trachea to vibrate and rub continuously, leading to inflammation. The external manifestation of tracheal inflammation is shortness of breath and nasal flaring. As for fever, there are three different types.</p>
<p>(1) Fever without sweat: The patient's whole body is hot, and the heat can burn the hand. The "Neijing" (Inner Canon of Medicine) describes it as "the body is like burning charcoal." However, the heat is only high, and there is no sweat. The patient is very uncomfortable and may even be unconscious.</p>
<p>(2) Fever with sweat: During the fever, the whole body has slight sweat. After sweating, the heat is slightly lower, but it does not clear completely. After a while, the heat rises again. This type of sweat is medically called spontaneous sweating, which cannot reduce the fever.</p>
<p>(3) Fever with only head sweat: The patient's body is hot, and the whole body and limbs have no sweat, but the head has sweat, or there is sweat up to the neck. This is called head sweat. Because the heat has no way out, it stagnates inside. However, despite the profuse sweat on the head, the heat does not decrease. The duration of the above three types of fever is usually two or three days. If the fever cannot be reduced with medicine during these two or three days, then "shazi" will brew successfully. During this period, the three different types of fever have three different treatments.</p>
<p>Attached: Three Treatments for Fever</p>
<p>(1) Treatment for fever without sweat:</p>
<p>Processed Ephedra sinica (zhi ma huang) 1.6g</p>
<p>Apricot kernel (xing ren) 12g</p>
<p>Processed Glycyrrhiza uralensis (zhi gan cao) 2.4g</p>
<p>Citrus reticulata (ju hong) 6g</p>
<p>Processed Perilla frutescens (zhi su zi) 12g</p>
<p>Pueraria lobata (ge gen) 6g</p>
<p>Modifications: If the patient has food retention, add Stir-fried Citrus aurantium (zhi shi tan) 4g Stir-fried Crataegus pinnatifida (cha tan) 12g to the prescription. If there is no sweat, high fever, and restlessness, add Gypsum fibrosum (sheng shi gao) 20g.</p>
<p>(2) Treatment for fever with sweat:</p>
<p>Cimicifuga heracleifolia (zhi jian) 0.8g</p>
<p>Apricot kernel (xing ren) 12g</p>
<p>Pueraria lobata (ge gen) 8g</p>
<p>Processed Glycyrrhiza uralensis (zhi gan cao) 2g</p>
<p>Mentha haplocalyx (bo he) 2.4g</p>
<p>Citrus reticulata (ju hong) 6g</p>
<p>Fritillaria thunbergii (xiang bei) 12g</p>
<p>Arctium lappa (niu bang) 12g</p>
<p>Modifications: If the internal heat is severe, add Gypsum fibrosum (sheng shi gao) 20g. If there is nausea, add Scutellaria baicalensis (huang qin) 6g Coptis chinensis (chuan lian) 1.2g.</p>
<p>(3) Treatment for fever with only head sweat:</p>
<p>Gypsum fibrosum (sheng shi gao) 12g</p>
<p>Processed Ephedra sinica (zhi ma huang) 1.6g</p>
<p>Apricot kernel (xing ren) 12g</p>
<p>Processed Glycyrrhiza uralensis (zhi gan cao) 2.4g</p>
<p>Pueraria lobata (ge gen) 6g</p>
<p>Modifications: If there is food retention, add Stir-fried Citrus aurantium (zhi shi tan) 4g Stir-fried Crataegus pinnatifida (cha tan) 12g. If the cough is severe, add Fritillaria thunbergii (xiang bei) 12g Processed Perilla frutescens (zhi su zi) 12g Citrus reticulata (du ju hong) 6g.</p>
<p>The above three prescriptions aim to clear away the heat and evil. If the patient's evil heat is mild, the disease will stop after clearing it away, and "shazi" will not develop. If the evil is excessive and the heat is severe, taking the above prescriptions can clear out the heat and evil and also help the body develop "shazi." Because clearing "shazi" is the most important thing, it is better to clear it as early as possible. The above two prescriptions have this effect. If the reader can prescribe medicine according to the condition, it can turn a serious illness into a minor illness, and a minor illness into no illness. If the disease type does not follow the usual pattern and questions arise, consult a good doctor as soon as possible, and do not miss the opportunity to treat the disease, or it will be too late to regret.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Symptoms of "Shazi" <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>After the initial incubation and the brewing of the fever period, the spots will appear. These spots are all over the skin. When touched by hand, the "shazi" spots are raised like small mounds, and the color is very bright red. After three days, the "shazi" spots gradually disappear, the cough increases, the fever gradually decreases, and the disease gradually recovers. This is the most normal type of "shazi." However, the most changes occur during the spot eruption period. Seven or eight out of ten cases will change. If you do not understand the principles of the various changes and do not have methods to deal with the various symptoms of the changes, you cannot be considered to understand "shazi." Now, I will write them down briefly for all readers.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Types of "Shazi" <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(1) Wind "Shazi": The mildest type of "shazi" is called wind "shazi." Its symptoms include slight fever, mild cough, and a slight sweat all over the body. Red spots appear when a fever develops, but they are faint and not very clear. The spots become more obvious when warm clothing is worn. If the child is strong, he can play as usual without obvious illness. After three to five days, he will naturally return to normal. However, during this period, parents do not need to seek doctors and take medicine. They only need to prevent him from going out in the wind and eating meat. Then, they can ensure that nothing goes wrong. Otherwise, the consequences can be terrible. One consequence is a prolonged cough that damages the delicate lungs. Another is that the "shazi" spots do not disappear and become very itchy, eventually turning into "shazi" scars. The "shazi" spots never disappear for life, and the skin is abnormally rough. When warm clothing is worn, it immediately becomes unbearably itchy. If it itches in a public place, it is inconvenient to scratch and unbearable to endure, which is truly unpleasant. Therefore, parents must pay special attention to him at this time.</p>
<p>(2) Red "Shazi": This type of "shazi" is the most common and much more dangerous than wind "shazi." In fact, it is necessary to take medicine. If treated properly and cared for properly, it can turn danger into safety. Conversely, there is a risk to life. In the early stages of this type of "shazi," the cough is quite severe, even completely unproductive, or even accompanied by shortness of breath and nasal flaring. During the fever period, the fever is very high, sometimes with delirium and hallucinations. During the spot eruption period, the spots are not easily visible, or the chest and back have spots, but the hands and feet have none, or although they are visible, they are not fully erupted, and the fever remains high and does not decrease. At this time, the "shazi" should be cleared and erupted as soon as possible. The prescription is as follows:</p>
<p>Pueraria lobata (ge gen) 4g</p>
<p>Apricot kernel (xing ren) 12g</p>
<p>Poria cocos rubra (chi fu ling) 12g</p>
<p>Poria cocos alba (bai fu ling) 12g</p>
<p>Wu Jia San (dose size illegible)</p>
<p>Mulberry leaf (sang ye) 12g</p>
<p>Mentha haplocalyx (bo he) 2.4g</p>
<p>Modifications: If there is no sweat, add Ephedra sinica (ma huang) 1.2g to the prescription. If the internal heat is severe, add Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) 16g Lonicera japonica (lian qiao) 12g Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (jin yin hua) 12g. If there is delirium, add Fel Bovis Calculus (dan cao) 1.2g Uncaria rhynchophylla (gou teng jian) 12g.</p>
<p>Externally, use Coriandrum sativum (yuan sui) soup to apply hot compresses. Once the "shazi" spots have fully erupted, the fever will subside, the mind will clear, and the cough will be relieved.</p>
<p>(3) Pale-faced "Shazi": This type of "shazi" is considered the most dangerous. Its distinctive feature is that the "shazi" spots have fully erupted all over the body, but not on the face. The patient feels nauseous, and the uvula is cyanotic, the complexion is pale. The stool is loose, or even diarrhea. At this time, the illness is extremely serious, and danger surrounds the patient. Because it is useless for the "shazi" to fully erupt only on the body, the most important thing is the face, especially the area next to the nose. This area is medically called the "human king" area. If the "shazi" spots in the "human king" area are fully erupted, it does not matter if there are few spots on the body. Therefore, at this time, the doctor should try to clear the "shazi" spots on the face as the only priority. The prescription is as follows:</p>
<p>Pueraria lobata (ge gen) 6g</p>
<p>Massa Fermentata (jian qu) 6g</p>
<p>Areca Peel (da fu pi) 12g</p>
<p>Stir-fried Dolichos lablab (chao bian dou) 12g</p>
<p>Poria Cocos (yun ling) 12g</p>
<p>Wu Jia San (dose size illegible)</p>
<p>Processed Ephedra sinica (zhi ma huang) 1.2g</p>
<p>Nelumbo nucifera (he di) 2.4g</p>
<p>Modifications: If there is food retention, add Crataegus pinnatifida (cha tan) 12g. If there is diarrhea, remove Ephedra sinica (ma huang). Externally, use Coriandrum sativum (yuan sui) soup to apply hot compresses to both sides of the nose, making the patient's face look red. However, when applying hot compresses, only apply and do not rub, because the skin of children is tender and rubbing can easily break the epidermis. Wring out a new towel and apply hot compresses, which is the most effective. After taking the medicine, if the diarrhea stops, the sweating is slight, and the red spots on the face are fully erupted, then the fever will subside, and the cough will be relieved. This indicates that the danger has turned into safety.</p>
<p>Wu Jia San Explanation:</p>
<p>This medicine is not commonly available in ordinary pharmacies in Shanghai. I usually need a lot of this medicine, so I feel very inconvenient. Therefore, I prepare this medicine according to the ancient prescription at a high price. Its nature is royal, and it is good at clearing eruptions. It is very effective for "shazi" that is hidden or not obvious, or appears and disappears quickly, as well as for wind "shazi" and red "shazi," when taken according to the method during the spot eruption period. Each dose costs five jiao. The method of administration is detailed separately.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Progression of "Shazi" <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The progression of "shazi" requires the most attention. "Shazi" that is progressing favorably, even if serious, is not a problem. As long as the doctor understands the pathology and uses medicine to guide the situation, it can be cured safely. If "shazi" that is progressing favorably cannot find a good doctor, it is better not to take medicine, because taking the wrong medicine will turn the favorable progression into an unfavorable one. I often encounter many cases of "shazi" that are progressing unfavorably. I have carefully investigated its origin. Six or seven out of ten cases are due to misdiagnosis, and three or four out of ten cases deteriorate naturally. For those cases of "shazi" that are progressing unfavorably, the doctor is considered to have fulfilled his responsibility if he can turn it into a favorable progression. But I need to explain clearly what is called favorable, what is called unfavorable, how to deal with favorable symptoms, and how to save unfavorable symptoms, so that people who read this booklet will not have any ambiguity.</p>
<p>(1) Shortness of breath and nasal flaring: Coughing is inevitable in the early stages of "shazi." If the cough is unproductive and the phlegm is not loose, even if the cough causes the face to turn red, these are all very common symptoms and should be expected. Just give him one or two doses of the prescription under the cough section of this book, and he will be relieved. If the severe cough persists and shortness of breath and nasal flaring are found, then it is critical. This shortness of breath and nasal flaring is an unfavorable symptom in the early stages of "shazi." What is the significance of this shortness of breath and nasal flaring for the patient? It should be known that shortness of breath and nasal flaring is a sign of inflammation of the bronchi in the lungs. In short, it means that it has turned into pneumonia. Therefore, as soon as shortness of breath and nasal flaring are seen, a doctor should be consulted, or the following prescription should be given. After taking it, the cough can be relieved, the phlegm can be loosened, and the shortness of breath and nasal flaring will disappear. The prescription is as follows:</p>
<p>The following sections of the article still include "Heat Attacks Inward", "Shazi Evil Sinks", and "Shazi Aftermath Syndrome", such as detailed symptoms and treatments for 100-day cough, noma, Shazi poison, and Shazi care methods.

<p>Dear Reader, this child, Guan Chao, suffered from Shazi with a dangerous and terrible process. The whole family was anxious and at a loss. Later, a friend sent me a book written by Mr. Gu Yushi, "Self-Treatment of Shazi", which details all kinds of Shazi and is based on Mr. Gu's experience. After reading it, I immediately sought a diagnosis and treatment from Mr. Gu. After his painstaking efforts, the crisis was turned into safety, and the child has now fully recovered. I am extremely grateful for his great virtue and have obtained Mr. Gu's consent to publish excerpts from the book in the newspaper, so that those with the same disease can know where to seek help.</p>

<p>Fuliang On the evening of the 5th, a certain unit of the Huajun Army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Anqing. A fierce battle broke out with the Japanese army outside the East Gate. The Huajun officers and soldiers were in high spirits. Despite the heavy bombing by Japanese aircraft and artillery, they repeatedly charged and killed, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated into the city. The Huajun Army immediately burned down the Japanese cooperative, the agricultural and industrial school, and the airfield depot. On the morning of the 6th, the Huajun Army took advantage of the victory and rushed into the city, and street battles immediately broke out, with fierce hand-to-hand combat. Both sides suffered extremely heavy casualties. Later, the Japanese army used a large number of tanks to charge and kill, and used city houses to form a strong fire net.

<p>Xingji The Huajun Army is still encircling and suppressing Anze and Fushan. In order to reduce the threat from the flanks and rear, the Japanese army mobilized more than a thousand Japanese and puppet troops from Hongtong starting on the 30th of last month to harass the central area between Anze and Fushan. One group of five hundred men, with five cannons, moved from Yutou to Dongxiang Village. They encountered a Huajun ambush and fought fiercely for six hours, suffering more than a hundred casualties. Another group of more than two hundred men, with three cannons, moved from Quting Town (southeast of Hongtong) to Guluo (east of Quting). They were intercepted by the Huajun Army and retreated to Jiayuan and Lijia Yuan (one mile southeast of Guluo). Another group of more than two hundred men invaded from Zocun to Dahongyuan. On the morning of the 1st, they were ambushed by the Huajun Army and retreated to Baijiagou (ten miles west of Guluo). Later, they joined the Japanese army in Guluo.

On the evening of the 29th, a group of Japanese soldiers sneaked into the Sheli (within the Donggou northwest of Guzhen) and were surrounded and annihilated by the Huajun Army, killing forty-eight men. The fiercest fighting occurred on the 1st. The Japanese and Huajun forces fought for high ground all day long. The Japanese army suffered more than two hundred casualties. More than a hundred Japanese soldiers from Xiqiaokou (north of Hejin) attacked the Huajun position on the afternoon of the 1st. After the Huajun Army fought bravely to meet them, the Japanese army did not succeed. The Japanese army who invaded northward from Xinjiang and Jishan were defeated by the Huajun Army in the Guanzhuang north Dong area, with casualties of 150 people. All were transported back to the city in large carts and mules. According to reports, Lieutenant Colonel Fuku, the commander, was injured and died immediately upon being transported to Xinjiang.

<p>Wuxiang (1) The Japanese army entrenched in Zihong stubbornly resisted and launched a fierce attack on the Huajun side on the 1st. They unexpectedly launched poison gas bombs, emitting a green smoke with a foul odor. Dozens of Huajun officers and soldiers were poisoned. (2) A certain division stationed east of Huoxian launched attacks for several consecutive days and achieved quite a few victories.

<p>The Japanese Army's Transportation Between Hunan and Hubei Has Been Interrupted. An Encounter Battle Occurred Near Liantang, and the Japanese Army Was Defeated and Fled Southward.</p>
<p>Pingjiang: Recently, Chinese guerrillas assisted the main forces, traversing southern Hubei, causing the Japanese army to be caught in a state of being overwhelmed. On the evening of the 3rd, they once again achieved a surprising victory, secretly breaking through the Japanese defense line from a certain location and launching a surprise attack on Jinniu Town, southwest of Daye. There were more than 500 Japanese soldiers in the town, who were caught in their sleep. After a fierce attack by the Chinese army, none of them escaped and were all annihilated. A large number of Japanese weapons, food, and documents were seized by the Chinese army. The exact number is still being verified. The Chinese army achieved this victory in one fell swoop and then advanced rapidly to a certain location that night. Furthermore, a railway bridge near Puqi was also destroyed by the Chinese army with extremely swift means a few days ago, and the Japanese transportation between Hunan and Hubei has been interrupted. The Chinese army in Tongcheng, Xianning, Nanlinqiao, and other places are still actively attacking. (Telegraph on the 6th)</p>

<p>A Certain Place in Hubei Province: The Japanese army has already begun an attempt to attack westward from northern Hubei. In the next few weeks, fierce battles are feared to occur in this area. According to Chinese sources, a large number of reinforcements have recently arrived, preparing to resist the Japanese army. The Chinese side seems determined to use all its strength to resist the Japanese army's advance. A reporter has just returned to Xinyang from the Chinese army's front line in Suixian County, 100 miles northwest of Hankou. Suixian County is located on the northern wing of the Chinese defensive line, extending southwest to the Han River, stopping at a certain place north of Anlu, which was occupied by the Japanese army six months ago. Then, the line continues south along the Han River. The Chinese army is currently defending the west bank, while the Japanese army is on the east bank. The Chinese army has ample small arms and machine guns but lacks heavy artillery. In the units on the northern wing, there are no heavier cannons other than mountain guns, while the Japanese army possesses cannons of various calibers, up to 6 inches. Although the army is currently fighting in the Suixian County area, tens of thousands of guerrillas are active behind them, entering and exiting areas with fewer defending forces. Although the strength of these guerrilla attacks may not have great immediate effects, over time, their effectiveness should not be underestimated. When the reporter arrived at the front line on May 1st, the Japanese army had already begun attacking various places northwest and southwest of Suixian County, aiming to remove the protruding points and occupy a position to encircle Suixian County from both wings. When the Japanese army attacked, they first bombarded for two hours, followed by infantry attacking from the north. The Chinese army held its ground, losing only a quarter of a mile of land by the end of the day. According to the Chinese army's statement to the reporter, the Chinese army suffered 600 casualties, and the Japanese army suffered at least the same number. While returning to Xinyang, the reporter witnessed Chinese reinforcements, supplies, and ammunition being transported to the front line, which demonstrates the determination of the Chinese army to fight hard on this front line.

<h3 id="e20">The Evolving International Situation <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The international situation never lingers in a static state for even a moment. From the perspective of the heart, emotions ebb and flow, and ideas shift. From the perspective of things, the environment, interests, and the waxing and waning of power change. Every unit of heart and matter intertwines, and the intertwining of units with each other leads to fermentation and brewing. Brewing may lead to disillusionment, such as the recent widespread rumor that U.S. President Roosevelt, out of concern for the European situation last year and seeking peace, had invited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler to meet on a neutral island in the North Atlantic, but the event did not materialize. Or, like the rumor yesterday that the German authorities had twice indicated to the Polish government this spring their intention to jointly attack the Soviet Union and carve up its territory, but this also did not materialize. There are countless such instances. And brewing from the inside to the outside eventually leads to different views emerging one after another, so that the evolution of the international situation is spoken of in terms of its visible dynamics. In fact, evolution is neither accidental nor sudden. The reach of evolution is by no means limited to what is visible, nor does it stop at the present. To speak of the present: The negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union to form an anti-aggression bloc have stalled. The negotiations between Germany, Italy, and Japan to conclude a military alliance have stalled. This change in the international situation is no longer the same as it was several weeks ago. Moreover, in the evolving international situation, there are still extremely noteworthy future evolutions.</p>
<p>The negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union on forming an anti-aggression bloc, and the negotiations between Germany, Italy, and Japan on strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance, each have their center of gravity. However, their success or failure, advantages and disadvantages, mutually influence each other and are mutually causal. These two matters can be viewed as one. The establishment of the original Anti-Comintern Pact was led by National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy. Germany and Italy each had their ambitions, all dissatisfied with the current state of European political divisions and economic barriers. They colluded and helped each other in their predicament. Now, judging by the congenital nature of the German and Italian regimes, they are incompatible with democracy. Judging by the object of their regimes, they are incompatible with communism. Only because democracy has long been regarded by Europeans as the golden rule, and communism has been seen by Europeans as venomous snakes and beasts, did they choose anti-communism as a common banner. It would indeed be most justified to destroy the Soviet Union and carve it up under the banner of anti-communism. However, the Soviet Union has worked hard to strengthen itself, reorganize its military, and stabilize its national foundation within a few years. While “communism” can be opposed, the Soviet Union cannot be insulted. Thus, they have taken advantage of loopholes and shifted their focus to the weak and small democracies. Germany and Italy claim to be anti-communist, but in fact, they have stepped back from communism. Therefore, even those who are not sympathetic to communism are no longer deceived by their slogans and distance themselves from them. They uniquely condemn their pursuit of the weak as aggression. Japan was the first to engage in aggression after the World War. Gaining Germany and Italy as allies, Japan was not only pleased that the path of aggression was no longer lonely, but also believed that China was not worth attacking and could eventually be swallowed up. The only obstacle to its continental policy was the Soviet Union. Thus, it was pleased to follow Germany and Italy and join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The origin of this pact of three countries is solely based on the fact that the stench of aggression is mutually attractive; there is no other reason. In the most recent year, Germany and Italy have been active in continental Europe, attracting more and more resentment and relaxing their hostility towards the Soviet Union. Conversely, Japan has spent more and more in China, so its fear of the Soviet Union has become even greater. Following Japan's wishes, it would certainly like to defeat the Soviet Union with Germany and Italy, but this is not something to be discussed now. At present, it only hopes to have Germany and Italy restrain the Soviet Union. As for strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance specifically against the Soviet Union, in Germany and Italy, there is no heroic ambition to fight the Soviet Union. Even Japan today has no surplus strength to fight the Soviet Union. Therefore, concluding a military alliance against the Soviet Union today is something that all three countries do not actually need. The only possible need is Japan's. If the Soviet Union were to participate in the war in the Far East, Japan would naturally hope that Germany and Italy would attack the Soviet Union on its western border. However, why should Germany and Italy be bound by military commitments and fight the Soviet Union for Japan? Following Germany and Italy's wishes, their current strong enemies are Britain, France, Poland, Turkey, and other countries, not the Soviet Union. Therefore, although they have no determination to fight Britain, France, Poland, and Turkey, given that they are in a position from which they cannot retreat, both internally and externally, if war breaks out due to an unexpected contact, it would be able to slightly strengthen its position by having Japan as an ally. Therefore, it is most willing to conclude a general military alliance with Japan. It can be said that a military alliance not specifically against the Soviet Union actually hopes to remove the Soviet Union and focus solely on Britain, France, and other countries. However, why should Japan be bound by military commitments and fight Britain and France for Germany and Italy? Simply put: The three countries form a military alliance, each with its needs, and what they need is absolutely not the same. If a general military commitment is concluded following Germany and Italy's lead, Japan would bear unnecessary and serious responsibilities, as Japan does not need to and is not beneficial to fight Britain and France. If a military commitment against the Soviet Union is concluded following Japan's lead, Germany and Italy would bear unnecessary and serious responsibilities, as Germany and Italy do not need to and are not beneficial to fight the Soviet Union. Moreover, Japan, which has no surplus strength to fight the Soviet Union today, still allows Germany and Italy to conclude a commitment against the Soviet Union. At least, in the present, this can be regarded as a diplomatic stalling tactic. Moreover, why promote hostility by concluding a commitment, given that it is already wary and fearful of the Soviet Union!</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not just about military relations. The diplomatic effect is also extremely subtle. After indulging in unrestrained aggression, Germany and Italy have caused Britain and France to rise up and plan to form an anti-aggression bloc. Anyone who deeply believes that both sides do not want to engage in war also recognizes that the crisis of war is everywhere. Therefore, Germany and Italy's efforts to win over Japan to prepare for the crisis has its military value. Furthermore, from the perspective of current diplomacy, if a general military commitment of the three countries can be established, Britain and France will inevitably have many concerns about Japan in the Far East, and will therefore slightly reduce their pressure on Germany and Italy in Europe. This is what Germany and Italy expect. By having Japan restrain the eastern border of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will inevitably have concerns, and will therefore slightly relax its approach to Britain and France. This is another thing that Germany and Italy expect. Observing that Britain and France have shown joy after Japan indicated that it was unwilling to conclude a general military commitment, the opposing concept of gains and losses that Germany and Italy have for this can be seen. As for the Soviet Union, it will certainly not sit idly by and watch Germany's advance eastwards and northwards, and Italy's growing power in Southern Europe. Therefore, it is happy to form an anti-aggression bloc with Britain and France. This is indeed an immutable principle. However, since Britain and France have given guarantees to Poland, Romania, and other countries, the Soviet Union's defense against German coercion has geographically gained Britain, France, Poland, and Romania as a wall of defense. Moreover, since Germany and Italy no longer target the Soviet Union, why must the Soviet Union hastily form an indissoluble bond with Britain and France for its own sake? Not only that, but the slight estrangement between the Soviet Union and Britain and France is enough to slightly kill the sense of unease that Japan feels towards the Soviet Union, which is also enough to make Japan slightly relax its collusion with Germany and Italy. The breakdown of the Anglo-Russian talks is certainly not a change in Soviet policy, but in terms of diplomatic effect, it should be viewed in this way.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, the international situation seemed to be getting tighter and tighter. The distinction between friend and foe was clearly confronting. Now, with various evolutions, it is no longer as acute as it was several weeks ago. However, the contradictions of the international community still exist. The current phenomenon is not allowed to stagnate, and it is not its end point. How the future will evolve, and the fortune, misfortune, and interests that come with it, are what the people of the country should pay attention to, and what the diplomatic authorities should keenly perceive and respond to skillfully.</p>

<p>Local News: Reuters in Shanghai received a delayed telegram today, sent on the evening of Thursday, regarding the situation in Chongqing on the day of the bombing. According to the telegram, when the British Consulate General was hit by a bomb, the British Ambassador, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, happened to be at the Foreign Ministry's guesthouse west of the British Consulate and was not in the consulate. However, that night, he crossed the cordon of the burned area to personally inspect the damage to the British Consulate. It is reported that when the consulate was bombed, the Acting Chinese Secretary of the British Embassy, B.G.B. Browne, First Secretary Greenway, and the British Consul General, Mr. and Mrs. Tours, were all in the courtyard of the consulate. The buildings used by the British diplomatic mission were hit by two bombs, but both bounced off the roof and exploded on the ground several yards away. As a result, all the glass windows of the building were shattered. The building where Consul General Tours and his wife lived was hit by four bombs and destroyed. Fortunately, both Mr. and Mrs. Tours were unharmed. The British Embassy and Consulate staff rescued the wounded Chinese under the dim light of lanterns. At 10:00 p.m., Browne, Greenway, and Mr. and Mrs. Tours had dinner together in a house full of ashes and broken glass. (7th)</p>

<p>A Chongqing dispatch reports that since the Japanese army captured Guangzhou and strengthened its efforts to cut off transportation in South China, people generally believed that transportation between the rear and the front lines and other regions would be obstructed, and commerce would stagnate. However, little do they know that the current transportation between the Southwest and Northwest regions, after planning by the transportation authorities, has been strengthened through highway transportation, railway construction, and expansion of telecommunications, aviation, and postal services. The transportation function is fully utilized, and the transshipment of goods, both domestically and internationally, is as smooth as ever. In addition to making every effort to connect railways to the borders of certain countries, some parts of which can already provide commercial transport, waterway transport is handled by the Yangtze River Shipping Joint Office, jointly established by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and various shipping companies, and the Inland River Shipping Joint Office, established by various port navigation administration bureaus, which control the navigation of various Jianghai shipping and inland river small shipping vessels. Since the Sichuan River has many dangerous shoals, methods for improving the shoals have been improved, shoal stations have been established in dangerous locations, and machines are used to winch ships over the shoals, so that human labor is no longer needed for towing. Air transport is still handled by China and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, which purchase additional aircraft and change flight prices at any time according to the changes in the war situation. The original flight schedules have been added to, and they are making every effort to maintain navigation while avoiding the deliberate destruction by Japanese aircraft. Not only can one arrive in important domestic cities from morning to evening, but it only takes five days to reach the capital of the Soviet Union, and often it takes seven days. Telegraph lines have been added in various provinces in the rear, and many connecting lines have been added between provinces. Many long-distance telephone lines have also been opened. It is heard that the amount of copper wire used by the Ministry of Communications in the past year is equivalent to the amount used in the previous ten years. International wireless telegraphs can directly communicate with major cities in Europe and America. In addition to adding many post offices, agency offices, village and town letter boxes, and village and town postal stations in various provinces in the rear, and opening more than 10,000 li of new postal routes, military postal services are also set up in the war zones to facilitate transportation as the battle lines shift. The progress of the postal service is amazing.</p>
<p>Highway transport is the main tool of transportation in the rear today. According to traveling merchants, the main roads in the Southwest provinces are now managed by the Southwest Highway Transportation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The highway from Yunnan to a certain country's border will soon be officially open to traffic and will be managed by another transportation administration bureau. The main roads in the Northwest provinces are also managed by the Northwest Highway Transportation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The Sichuan highway, which connects the Southwest and Northwest roads, is handled by the Sichuan Highway Bureau. After the Ministry of Communications improved the original roads and opened new lines, it has presented a prosperous scene of connectivity in all directions. For example, from Kunming, Yunnan to Chongqing, the car journey is only five and a half days, and the ticket price is 50 yuan and 65 cents in national currency. Guiyang, Guizhou to Chongqing, the journey is two and a half days, and the ticket price is 21 yuan and 50 cents. Shuaizhou, Guangxi to Chongqing, the journey is five and a half days, and the ticket price is 49 yuan and 30 cents. Changsha to Chongqing, the journey is six and a half days, and the ticket price is 65 yuan and 90 cents. Soon there will be a new road that can be used to shorten the journey. Kunming, Yunnan to Guiyang, Guizhou, the journey is three days, and the ticket price is 29 yuan and 15 cents. Kunming to Changsha, the journey is seven days, and the ticket price is 73 yuan and 65 cents. Chongqing to Chengdu, the journey is two days, and the ticket price is 24 yuan and 75 cents. Chengdu to the intersection connecting the Longhai Railway, the journey is three days, and the ticket price is 29 yuan and 90 cents. To the provincial capital of Gansu, the journey is six days, and the ticket price is 57 yuan. From the provincial capital of Gansu to the provincial capital of Shaanxi, the journey is four days, and the ticket price is 33 yuan and 90 cents. To the provincial capital of Qinghai, the journey is two days, and the ticket price is 14 yuan and 5 cents. Hanzhong to Qinghai, the journey is five and a half days, and the ticket price is 42 yuan. From Sichuan to Yunnan, there is another eastern Sichuan-Yunnan road, connecting the Sichuan highway. The western section of the road from Gansu to Xinjiang, and from Gansu to Qinghai, the western road between Gansu and Qinghai, the road from southern Shaanxi to the border of Henan, and the road connecting the north and south of Shaanxi, and the road directly connecting Gansu to Sichuan, the road from Sichuan to Hubei, and the roads between Chengdu and Kangding have all been improved, making transportation extremely convenient. In addition, there are Kangdian, Diangui, Qingkang, Kangyin, as well as the western road between Guizhou and Guangxi, the southern section between Gansu and Sichuan, the various roads in Sichuan and Zheng, the eastern road between Sichuan and Shaanxi, and a certain road connecting Guizhou and Guangxi and Diangui are all under construction. Also, a certain highway between Sichuan and Yunnan has been completed, and joint water and land transportation is being carried out using human and animal power. At present, Sichuan native products such as tung oil and Chinese gallnut are all transported and sold through this road, which is of great help to the war of resistance trade. (April 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">British and American Warships Gather in Hong Kong <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>A Hong Kong dispatch reports that due to the tense situation in Europe, Hong Kong, although seemingly calm on the surface, is actually very uneasy inside. Since the Hong Kong government announced that it would advise all Hong Kong residents to store two months' worth of food in preparation for an emergency, although the government authorities then expressed regret, the general public has become even more uneasy as a result. At the same time, in recent days, the number of British warships concentrated in Hong Kong waters has exceeded previous records. In addition, there are four American warships berthed in Hong Kong. This measure is clearly related to the international situation, so the general public is even more concerned about the future of world peace and war. According to general speculation, since the tense situation in Europe, the British authorities, fearing that they would be unable to cope with the Far East once the war broke out, are cooperating with the United States. If a European war breaks out, the safety of the Pacific will be the sole responsibility of the United States. Once this agreement is reached, the entire Pacific Fleet of the United States will sail east, and British warships stationed in the Far East will also begin to prepare for contingencies. According to investigations, the British warships currently in Hong Kong include three cruisers: HMS Kent, HMS Birmingham, and HMS Cardiff; one supply ship, HMS Resource; three shallow-water gunboats: HMS Robin, HMS Scarab, and HMS Scimitar; nine destroyers: HMS Duncan, HMS Griffin, HMS Dainty, HMS Decoy, HMS Diana, HMS Diamond, HMS Scout, HMS Wishart, and HMS Tenedos; in addition, there is one submarine mother ship, HMS Medway, and one squadron of the 4th Submarine Flotilla. Also, the cruiser HMS Yura is currently sailing from the UK and is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month. After the ship arrives, it will become the flagship of Rear Admiral Murray, the newly appointed commander of the 5th Cruiser Squadron. As for the American warships in Hong Kong, there are a total of four: one is the flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, USS Augusta, and the other three are gunboats. The berthing of these warships in Hong Kong is clearly to assist British warships in coping with extraordinary events.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is also news that is quite interesting and cannot help but be surprising. It is said that a certain British mining engineering expert recently submitted a suggestion to the Hong Kong government to plan to tunnel through Victoria Peak, which dominates the central part of Hong Kong, to build a large tunnel. This tunnel will be 12,000 feet long, 20 feet high, and 40 feet wide. Once completed, not only will the transportation between the north and south parts of Hong Kong no longer have to wind around the mountains, but in the event of an emergency, this large tunnel can become a large air-raid shelter capable of accommodating 100,000 people, and will not be harmed in the slightest no matter how enemy aircraft bomb it. It is heard that the construction of this tunnel will take ten months and cost 1,166,300 Hong Kong dollars. It is heard that the Hong Kong government is carefully considering this proposal, and a decision may be made in the near future. (April 28th)</p>

The Frankfurter Zeitung reported that the Germans residing in Danzig are prepared to defend Danzig with their blood, but we should make bloodshed unnecessary. After the German Foreign Minister and Ciano conclude their talks on formulating a second less measure to break through the encirclement policy, a scene different from what some people want to see will appear.

Dr. Magensen, the Soviet ambassador to Italy, and Attolico, the Italian ambassador to the Soviet Union, were present. Ciano then hosted a banquet for Ribbentrop and his party at the Continental Hotel in the evening, and invited local party and government leaders to attend. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A communication from the Foreign Ministry of the Soviet Union stated that the most important event discussed by the German and Italian foreign affairs authorities in Milan was the issue of Danzig and the methods to resist the encirclement policy. The general impression among foreigners here is that Germany is now asking Mussolini to mediate the dispute between Germany and Poland. However, there is no way to obtain confirmed news from official circles (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to opinions in political circles here, no important decisions regarding Danzig may be made at present, but it is rumored that someone advocates holding a referendum in Danzig to vote on whether to return to Germany or remain a free city. According to well-informed sources, Hitler did meet with Greiser, the chairman of the Danzig Senate, and Forster, the leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party, yesterday. After Foreign Minister Ribbentrop learned of the aspirations of the Danzig leaders, he went to Milan under Hitler's orders to meet with the Italian Foreign Minister. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to official news from yesterday afternoon, the news published in foreign newspapers that the leaders of the Danzig branch of the National Socialist Party, Foss, and the chairman of the Danzig Senate, Greiser, were summoned by Hitler to Berschtesgaden, is not accurate. It is a misunderstanding because Foss and Greiser happened to leave the Free City of Danzig for other places. In fact, Foss is currently recuperating in Wiesbaden, and Greiser went to Hamburg to participate in the celebration of the 750th anniversary of the city's founding. Political figures believe that the Danzig issue does not need to be discussed at Hitler's residence. Also, the British newspapers' statement that Germany intends to adopt a referendum method to merge Danzig into Germany is not true and there is no need for it, because in the elections of deputies in the city of Danzig, Germans account for 96% of the total number of voters, which is an absolute majority, and there is no doubt about it.

<p>(Berlin) Berlin newspapers reported that German overseas Chinese in Poland are returning to Germany one after another due to Polish mistreatment, and severely criticized the Polish government. According to the German News Agency, there is now a refugee shelter near Marenweier, Germany. Anyone who flees back to the country from Poland must reside in the shelter for a few days until they find a place to settle in the province of East Prussia. In April, a total of 216 men and women brought their children to the Marenweier area from Poland. Since April 28, the day Hitler spoke in Congress, another 100 adults and children have crossed into German territory. Many people continue to flee from the vicinity of Danzig to Germany. Berlin newspapers said that Polish armed mobs, under the instructions of the Polish authorities, are using terrorist acts to inflict on Germans. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to claims here, Poland recently tricked Dr. Gorber, a famous German traveler in Poland, and Count Gulzi into being expelled from the country. Germany has now decided to retaliate by ordering two Polish landlords near Malinhuatai in West Prussia to leave the country with their families within three days. The real estate they leave behind will be managed by Soviet farmers, just as the Poles manage the property of the expelled Germans. (Haitong, 7th)</p>

<p>Warsaw: According to authoritative sources last night, Poland is unwilling to take the initiative to start negotiations with Germany regarding the solution to the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues. The Polish government believes that Germany should now respond to the public negotiations requested by Polish Foreign Minister Beck. At the same time, rumors here claim that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may come forward to mediate the Polish-German crisis, because he does not want to be involved in the European war vortex because of the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues. Polish officials last night strongly denied the German reports of terrorist activities against German overseas Chinese in Poland. It is heard that from the position of the previous Polish government, the following significant facts are true: (1) Polish Foreign Minister Beck gave a speech to Congress on Friday, outlining Poland's policy on Danzig and the Polish Corridor. (2) According to German reports, Hitler has rejected Beck's statement. (3) Poland has stated everything in its recent statement. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>

<p>Papal Envoy Visits Hitler, Opinions Vary on the Content</p>
<p>Vatican: After Archbishop Orsenig, the Vatican's ambassador to Germany, met with Soviet leader Hitler, and Archbishop Van Li, the ambassador to France, met with French Foreign Minister Pomler, the general public here was very surprised that the Archbishop made a special trip to Berschtesgaden Town to seek an audience with the leader. In addition, the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy are conducting talks in Milan, Italy, and Orsenig is giving importance to it, and it is generally believed that this is a concrete action by Pope Pius XII to call for peace. Although Vatican officials said that Archbishop Orsenig's audience with leader Hitler was related to the German government's closure of schools run by the Catholic Church, the general public paid more attention to his audience with leader Hitler the day before the start of the talks. It is heard that Pope Pius XII has been focusing on considering the issue of maintaining peace since he took office, and it is very likely that he will call for peace at this time. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Archbishop Orsenigo, the Vatican's ambassador to Germany, flew to Berschtesgaden Town yesterday and met with leader Hitler for an hour. Political figures here have commented a lot after hearing the news. It is heard that Archbishop Orsenia presented a letter from Pope Pius XII to leader Hitler. As for its content, opinions vary. Some say that it is only related to the dispute between Germany and Poland, and others say that the Vatican is now working to promote general peace. The letter is not aimed at a specific issue, and the parties involved are not limited to Germany. It is not known which of the two statements is true. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the dispute between Germany and Poland, although the Vatican wants to mediate, diplomatic circles here are deeply afraid that this move will cause a new crisis, and there are doubts. This is because Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, has made it clear that Germany must respect Poland's territorial sovereignty before there is room for negotiations. Although, there are many people working to mediate between Germany and Poland. The activities of the Holy See are particularly common. The general idea is that since the Soviet Union merged Austria, it has become a Catholic country and can accept the mediation of the Holy See without harming national dignity. On the other hand, Catholicism has always been prevalent in Poland, and there is no reason for the country to refuse the advice of the Holy See. Until now, the Holy See has not formally</p>

<p>Vatican: The French Catholic Church is now holding a conference in Alger, French Algeria in North Africa. Pope Pius XII delivered a broadcast speech to the conference in French at noon today, calling for peace, stating: "Humanity's spirituality has been deceived by heresy, and the nations of the world are therefore uneasy.

Then he blessed all those who participated in the conference, the French missionary societies in Africa, and the indigenous Christians.

The country's public opinion may not agree with Germany and Poland fighting to satisfy political demands, and the country's government may also take on the role of mediator. However, the foreign affairs authorities of Germany and Italy are guiding the Nordic countries and the Baltic Sea countries to maintain neutrality with large-scale actions, while advising Romania and Yugoslavia to stay away from their allies in the East and West. Germany also wants to use the slow progress of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to guide the Soviet Union to change its foreign policy. If all these plans are successful, Poland will be surrounded. Based on this, if Germany wants its plans to proceed gradually, it will not take any immediate action against Poland. However, I am afraid that the crisis will not be far away. (Havas, 6th)</p>

The two resolutions proposed by Britain the day before yesterday were drafted by reconciling the opinions of Britain and France.

The Times' diplomatic correspondent recently commented, "Britain has not directly rejected the Soviet Union's proposed military alliance plan, but wants to limit the scope of negotiations, first asking the Soviet Union to come forward and provide assistance when the Baltic and Balkan countries are invaded. If the Soviet Union insists on its original proposal, negotiations may break down." As for the negotiations between Britain and Turkey, "Rumors are spreading that the full text of the agreement will be announced within days, but this seems premature.

<p>Negotiations Are Possible</p>
<p>(London) After the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 (stipulating that the total tonnage of the German Navy should not exceed 35% of the British Navy) was unilaterally declared void by Germany on April 28th, naval circles here recently stated that according to the information exchange provisions contained in the 1938 Anglo-Italian Naval Agreement, the technical characteristics of newly built British warships should be notified to all countries, and those countries would inevitably pass them on to Germany, but Germany would not notify Britain of its warship construction plans. This is very disadvantageous to Britain. In order to remedy this deficiency, Britain could declare the Anglo-Italian Naval Agreement void, but the relationship between the two countries is already not very good, and it would be inconvenient to further aggravate it. Therefore, it is very possible that Britain and Germany will reopen naval negotiations in the short term to seek a fundamental solution. However, if a new agreement is signed, it should only be considered if such an agreement can help promote international peace. In this regard, the naval attaché of the British Embassy in Germany is maintaining contact with German naval circles to find out the country's true intentions. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>To Prevent Domestic Rice Prices from Rising</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to control the sale of food and maintain reasonable rice prices and prevent speculative trading, the Japanese government has promulgated a new law to establish the Japan Rice Corporation, a semi-official entity. Its capital will be borne by the government and rice merchants nationwide. The new corporation will monopolize the domestic rice market in Japan. The existing food exchanges and spot markets will also be replaced by the corporation. Speculative activities involving forward trading of rice are strictly prohibited. Only spot transactions based on actual needs and within the maximum and minimum prices stipulated by the government are allowed in order to prevent abnormal fluctuations in rice prices and ensure the smooth distribution of this major food supply. Rice markets operated by the new corporation will be established throughout Japan and will become important rice sales centers. It is estimated that after Japan implements its production increase plan, it will produce approximately 300 million bushels of rice in the next season, not including the 45 million bushels remaining from the previous season. At current rice prices, the total value of rice produced in the next season is approximately 2.3 billion yen. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e47">The Focus of the War on the Eastern Front of Guangdong Province Remains in Zengcheng <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Attempt to Invade Mount Luofu, Chinese Troops Also Prepare to Counterattack Zengcheng</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence. Since the Chinese army's counterattack on Zengcheng by the Chen Shuying, Wei De, Liu Kexiong, and other units of Liang Shiji, Hua Zhenzhong, Huang Tao, and other divisions on the 13th and 14th of last month, and the subsequent street fighting with the Japanese army, the war situation has been extremely fierce. In addition to stubbornly resisting, the Japanese troops in the city and those in Shitan and Guangzhou rushed to reinforce under the cover of Japanese aircraft. As a result, a bloody battle broke out repeatedly, with advances and retreats occurring more than a dozen times. Later, the Chinese Air Force coordinated with the army's offensive, dispatching seven aircraft in formation to bomb and destroy the Zengtan Highway and the Guangzeng Highway, preventing Japanese reinforcements. They also dropped dozens of bombs on the Japanese positions near Zengcheng. At that time, the Japanese troops were retreating and were caught off guard, suffering heavy casualties. The Chinese troops of Chen Shuying and Wei De took advantage of the situation to advance and completely recapture Zengcheng. Shortly afterwards, the Chinese army withdrew from Zengcheng in a planned action, adopting a steady and cautious strategy. Therefore, they maintained a favorable and active position. The war situation fluctuated, but has since become even more tense. According to military news from the front, the Chinese army's withdrawal from Zengcheng was intended to lure the Japanese troops again and deplete them as much as possible. Therefore, the arrangements for the counterattack on Zengcheng are extremely thorough and have been completed. The large army stationed in Boluo has been mobilized to the front lines. Mount Luofu and the Futian area are full of elite troops, advancing steadily towards the Japanese positions in Zengcheng. Fierce battles have already occurred in Paitan and Shikeng. However, the Japanese troops attacking Paitan have shifted their tactics to harassment because they have not succeeded. They are now using a large force along the Zengbo Highway to invade Mount Luofu and the Futian area. The Chinese army has also deployed troops to various locations to respond to the rapidly changing military situation. Therefore, the focus of the war on the eastern front has shifted to the Futian and Jigongkeng areas. When the Japanese troops first invaded Futian, they were stopped by the Chinese army at Jigongkeng and suffered a severe blow. Subsequently, the Japanese troops continued to reinforce, so on the 20th and 21st, the two armies fought fiercely for the positions between Jigongkeng and Futian, engaging in close combat. The fighting on those two days was extremely intense. On the 21st, the Japanese troops, with a force of over 600 men, equipped with more than a dozen small mortars and covered by aircraft, advanced towards the Chinese positions at Sumaoping at the foot of Mount Luofu in the rain. The Chinese troops of Wei and Chen, who were defending the area, held their positions and fought back calmly. The third district guerrilla team led by Lin Junsheng outflanked the Japanese troops, launching a surprise attack from the rear, attacking from both sides, and engaging the Japanese troops in close combat for two hours. The Japanese troops suffered over a hundred casualties and were unable to sustain their offensive, so they fled in a panic. Also, at 4:00 PM on the same day, 150 Japanese cavalrymen departed from Yangmeilong and invaded Lizhiao. The Chinese troops led by Chen Ji, having been informed in advance, dispatched 200 elite troops to ambush in the mountainous areas of Liutaiao and Pingfengling, waiting in full force. Soon, the Japanese cavalry arrived rapidly. The Chinese troops remained silent until they had passed the positions, and then launched a sudden interception, using hand grenades and bayonets to fight. After half an hour of chaotic fighting, the Japanese troops retreated in panic along the Bobo Highway. The Chinese troops did not pursue them. In this battle, over a dozen Japanese soldiers were killed, over twenty warhorses were captured, and two Japanese warhorses were captured alive. The Chinese army also suffered several casualties. Currently, the two armies are still in a stalemate. It is observed that the Japanese troops intend to break through Futian and occupy Mount Luofu in order to control the key points of Boluo and create a shield for their positions in Shilong, Shitan, and Luogang, thereby protecting Guangzhou. Although the Japanese troops are constantly reinforcing and advancing along the Zengbo Highway, the Chinese army also attaches great importance to that area and has a very strong force stationed there.</p>
<p>Currently, there are over a thousand Japanese soldiers stationed in Zengcheng, and over a dozen motorboats are docked outside the east gate. There are also over a thousand newly arrived Japanese soldiers in the Fuhe and Zhucun areas northwest of Zengcheng. Together with the Japanese troops previously stationed in that area, there are a total of three thousand men. There is also a Japanese regiment stationed near Zengcheng. Chinese senior commanders Wu Qiwai and Ye Zhao have rushed to the front lines to plan the counterattack. The future major battle on the Dongjiang River is expected to occur in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Movements of Japanese and Puppet Troops in Various Counties of Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Troops in Huaiyin and Funing Are Very Weak, Traitors in Suqian, Dangshan, and Xuzhou Are Killed</p>
<p>Taixian Correspondence. After the fall of Huaiyin, Huai'an, and Funing counties in northern Jiangsu, the Japanese troops and puppet organizations have been extremely oppressive to the local people. The following is a record of their movements:</p>
<p>Huaiyin</p>
<p>There are over 200 Japanese troops stationed in Huaiyin, and the headquarters is located in the attached elementary school of Huaiyin Normal School. The east, south, and west gates have all been blocked, with only the north gate remaining open for entry and exit. Soldiers are stationed there, guarding it strictly. A large bridge has been built on the Yellow River surface north of Wangying, and 30 to 40 Japanese soldiers are stationed in Wangying, with an electric grid deployed. Japanese cars and tanks frequently travel on the Huaisi Highway, and over 100 cavalrymen patrol back and forth to confuse the public. The puppet maintenance association is located in the Dalu Hotel, and the puppet chairman is Zheng Dazai, who used to be the head of the first district. The puppet vice chairman is Li Yushu, who used to be the director of the county relief center. The puppet chairman of the Chamber of Commerce is Huang Zihou (who used to be the town head of the first district's central market town). The puppet association now sells travel permits for ten cents each. Those entering the city must bring at least 3 yuan and 60 cents or two dou of grain to maintain half a month's rations. After entering the city, they are subject to Japanese and puppet control and are not allowed to leave. Therefore, few people enter the city, and the city is extremely desolate.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in Huaiyin demanded 200 able-bodied men and 100 women from the villages north of Wangying, with a deadline for delivery. The people were greatly angered. When the deadline arrived, 40 to 50 Japanese soldiers went to forcibly take them. The people resisted with earthen cannons, killing over 20 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese side increased its troops to suppress them. That night, all the people evacuated, and the houses in the villages were burned down. Currently, the people of northern Huaiyin have risen up in resistance.</p>
<p>Funing</p>
<p>Since Funing was occupied by the Japanese troops, it has been attacked by the Chinese army from time to time. Because the Japanese side has weak forces and cannot allocate enough, it is actively supporting puppet organizations to recruit puppet troops in the hope of increasing its strength. However, apart from hooligans, no one else is participating in the recruitment. The chairman of the puppet organization, Jiang Song, is a former bailiff who was dismissed from the county government, a low-level rogue who is generally despised. Now, he has brazenly taken the post of chairman of the "Maintenance Association," which shows his beliefs and strength.</p>
<p>The 150 Japanese troops in the city, of whom only two-tenths are Japanese and Koreans, are stationed in the civilian houses on the main roads of the city. They have not stationed in any agencies or public places. Their unit number is "Eastern Unit Headquarters," and the highest headquarters is located in Dongkan Town in the second district. Over 100 Japanese soldiers are stationed in the town, blocking most of the alleyways and crossroads to prevent attacks by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops are recruiting new soldiers in the city and have now recruited over a hundred people, all of whom are unemployed vagrants from the villages near Funing City. They have also organized a public security bureau, with a quota of 30 police officers. So far, only about 10 have been recruited. Food is provided by the Japanese side, and its purpose is to identify the people.</p>
<p>The chairman of the puppet maintenance association, Jiang Song (also known as Hu Chen), is from Funing City. He used to be a bailiff in the Funing County Government. When Funing City fell last year, he repeatedly colluded with bandits to rob and kidnap, and was wanted but not caught. The location of the maintenance association is inside the Tongfenghuo Commercial Firm on South Main Street in Funing. It has over 100 members. Jiang Song receives a salary of 80 yuan per month, and other members receive 30 yuan per month. These traitors are divided into three groups to work. One group spies on Chinese military intelligence and investigates wealthy households in the countryside, leading Japanese and puppet troops to search them. One group accompanies the Japanese pacification team on activities. One group is stationed in the puppet maintenance association, providing advice and consultation to the Japanese military. These traitors wear plain clothes and have a white cloth armband on their arm, with the words "Made in Japan" and a red square stamp.</p>
<p>On the 17th at noon, over 30 civilian residences were looted at the Dongxinyang River vegetable market in Funing. At about 6:00 PM, over 30 cavalrymen drove to Beisha.</p>
<p>The Funing puppet special task force is led by a Japanese man named Dagang. Dai Yuangui is the puppet commander of the group, Zhu Bowu is the puppet deputy commander, Jiang Song is the instructor of the Funing puppet plainclothes team, and Guo Dafu is the puppet security battalion commander. At 3:00 PM on the 23rd, Japanese troops drove five cars from Dongkan to Funing City. It is said that they were carrying many wounded and dead Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Siyang</p>
<p>The Siyang County × Regular Brigade encountered six Japanese motorboats and over a dozen sailboats sailing upstream in the Sanbao area behind Zhenglou County on the 20th afternoon. The brigade immediately attacked head-on. Although the Japanese troops returned fire, the Chinese troops occupied hidden terrain and sank two Japanese motorboats, killing seven or eight Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Suqian</p>
<p>Wei Yongdong, a commissioner sent by the Yaowan puppet maintenance association to collect money in various villages, was captured in Suqian some days ago by Li Weiting, the commander of the Suqian First Brigade. Under interrogation, Wei confessed to colluding with the enemy and was executed by firing squad in Shitouzhen as a warning to others. Also, Liu Xiu, the district head of the first district of Suqian, killed a Japanese spy named Hu Dezhong and obtained a detective certificate. County Head Lu awarded him 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Lianshui</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in Lianshui initially numbered about 200 men, but have recently been repeatedly transferred and are now only 50 to 60 men. At the lowest point, there were only over 20 men. To cover up, they forcibly pulled people to put on yellow uniforms and impersonate Japanese soldiers. When they went out, they were not allowed to speak. Recently, in order to scout out the situation of the Chinese army and guerrillas, they appointed Han Chinese Yue Weicheng as the reconnaissance chief, hiring over 70 hooligans to scout in various villages. The puppet chairman of the maintenance association, Jiang Zhongwei, the puppet vice chairman, Gu Futian, and the puppet secretary, Tan Xicheng, colluded with each other, but due to financial difficulties, in addition to levying donations on shops in the city, they also sold travel permits for five cents each. They have now issued over 7,500 permits, but there are only over 400 residents in the city. Therefore, the Japanese troops are suspicious and fear that guerrillas have infiltrated the city. Therefore, they are extremely strict in inspecting residents entering the city and allow them to enter but not leave.</p>
<p>Dangshan</p>
<p>The chairman of the Dangshan puppet maintenance association, Tang Buyun, is a local gentry who exploits the people and commits all kinds of evils. After the Japanese troops entered the city, he took up the puppet position, specializing in undermining the war of resistance. He was recently captured by the magistrate of Dangshan County, Dou Ruisheng, and has been executed by firing squad as a warning.</p>
<p>Xuzhou</p>
<p>Qin Ziyun, a hooligan from Xuzhou, is generally despised in the local area. When he ran the Xuzhou Gongyan Newspaper, he was once detained by the former magistrate of Tongshan County, Wang, for extortion. After the fall of Xuzhou, Qin immediately tried to curry favor and obtained a puppet position in the puppet maintenance association, where he continued to commit all kinds of evils, acting as a lackey for the Japanese and oppressing the people. The matter was detected by the Japanese special service organization, which skinned Qin alive at the former site of the Xuzhou Women's Normal School, resulting in his death. This is also the fate of a traitor.</p>

<p>Japanese Side Strictly Maintains Secrecy, Vacancy Temporarily Filled by Tsuchiya</p>
<p>Yangzhou dispatch: The Japanese military commander in Yangzhou, Ogawa, committed suicide on the evening of the 1st. The reason was that there was a military cafeteria on Xinsheng Street in Yangzhou, which had a female attendant. Initially, she had an affair with a Japanese translator, Mr. A. Later, she had relations with Ogawa. The woman was assassinated by Mr. A. several days ago. The night before last, Ogawa, after getting drunk in the Jiangbei Hotel, reprimanded the translator, who refused to accept it. Enraged, Ogawa shot and killed the translator. Shibata, a member of the Japanese appeasement group, heard the sound and went inside to investigate. Knowing that he could not hide the truth, Ogawa returned to the Japanese headquarters and committed suicide with a pistol, the bullet entering through his left arm, killing him instantly. The Japanese side is strictly maintaining secrecy about this matter and prohibits people from discussing it. Currently, the vacancy of the Japanese commander is temporarily filled by Tsuchiya, the leader of the appeasement squad.</p>

<p>Twelve Schools Have Already Found New Locations</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War, the Shanghai concession area, due to international relations, has been in a special situation and the area has been more peaceful than the inland. As a result, the population fleeing to Shanghai from the war zones has surged. A portion of the students from elementary, middle, and high schools have come to Shanghai to study. Therefore, the education industry in Shanghai has become increasingly developed, with new schools springing up like mushrooms after rain. The Shanghai Municipal Council, recognizing that the schools in the concession area are severely overcrowded, in addition to increasing education subsidies to the schools, has ordered the schools to find ways to solve the overcrowding problem, either by finding suitably spacious buildings or relocating the schools, so as to accommodate students as much as possible and not hinder their studies. It is now known that after the circular was issued by the department, twelve schools, including Dahua Huamin, Zhimin, and Hua Si, have already found new locations and submitted applications for review, so that they can relocate as scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Ministry of Education Continues to Promote Nationwide High School Graduation Exams <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Seeks Remedies for Defects, Education Section Chief Dai Yingguan's Discussion</p>
<p>(Chongqing dispatch) Dai Yingguan, who is in charge of secondary education at the Ministry of Education's Department of General Education, recently wrote an article discussing the issue of high school graduation exams, listing the reasons and facts for nationwide high school graduation exams in China, as well as in countries such as England, France, Germany, and Italy. The lengthy and detailed article mentioned the Ministry of Education's attempts in recent years to remedy the defects in this matter, and the implementation of three major policies (revising curriculum standards, vigorously promoting teacher training, and manufacturing scientific instruments). This shows the Ministry of Education's determination to vigorously promote high school graduation exams and continue to make progress. Due to space limitations, the following is a summary of the section on the trend of national exams:</p>
<p>Exams are a regular matter for schools. The implementation of any educational system, ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, relies on exams. The methods of exams should be constantly studied to improve them, and the process cannot be abolished. Those who wish to abolish it started with the theories of liberation and reform since the May Fourth Movement. At that time, the Chinese people hated the rampant warlords and, taking advantage of the end of the European war, advocated the abolition of soldiers. Soldiers could not be abolished, but military training in schools was abolished. Pained by the darkness of politics, they advocated liberation and reform, but they could not achieve it, and student movements arose one after another, and exams in schools at all levels across the country were abandoned. Under bad politics, there is also bad education, which is not surprising. When the new school system was implemented, school facilities were chaotic and curricula were disorganized. The holding of exams in schools became a mere formality. All of this reflected the peak of various chaotic phenomena on the eve of the coming era of the Northern Expedition and unification. After the establishment of the National Government, education was the first priority of construction. School systems were established, facilities were adjusted, and nationwide high school graduation exams were held, integrating the individual graduation exams formerly held by each school and organized by the provincial departments. With one shift, the benefits became apparent and the drawbacks were eliminated. However, opponents believed that the harms outweighed the benefits, which must be examined. First, let us describe the changes:</p>
<p>(1) The changes in the exam methods began with the "Provisional Regulations for Graduation Exams for Primary and Secondary School Students" promulgated in May of the 21st year [1932]. In December of the 22nd year [1933], the primary school exams were abolished, and the "Regulations for Graduation Exams for High School Students" were promulgated. In the 24th year [1935], the "Revised Regulations for Graduation Exams for High School Students" were promulgated. In April of the 25th year [1936], an order was issued to promulgate the "Changed Methods for Graduation Exams for High School Students," which have been continuously used since then. (Details of the various regulations regarding exam subjects, passing and retaking exam subjects, discussion of student grades, calculation of school grades, etc., are omitted from the original text.) The purpose of the exams is nothing more than to earnestly supervise and unify standards. The laxity of school exams in the past has led to a decline in students' level. The decline of secondary education across the country before and after the Northern Expedition and unification is a fact that no one can deny. Since the holding of exams, both teachers and students have worked hard at their careers, and the curriculum and teaching materials of each school have had to gradually comply with standards and be strictly implemented. As for the malpractices caused by the exams, such as "students bearing excessive burden of exams," there have been "exam subjects" and exemptions from school graduation exams as remedies. (2) The difficulty of promotion and re-examination for those who fail in one or two subjects has been appropriately regulated by amending the regulations. (3) The malpractices in calculating school grades for non-exam subjects have been corrected by changing the methods. (4) The drawbacks of calculating grades based on the school as a unit have been more clearly addressed by changing the methods.</p>
<p>(2) High school graduation exams in European countries (Examples of high school graduation exams in England, France, Germany, and Italy are omitted from the original text of 3,600+ characters.)</p>
<p>(3) What are the results of the exams? The function of the exams, in terms of earnestly supervising and unifying standards, has been described above. As for the actual teaching situation of each subject reflected in the exam results, according to the statistics from the 21st [1932] to the 23rd year [1934], in terms of the best subjects, the best subject in senior high school in the 21st year was Chinese Language and Party Principles, and the best subjects in junior high school were Party Principles, Chinese Language, and Geography. In the 22nd year, the best subjects in senior high school were Geography, Party Principles, Chinese Language, Science, and History. In terms of the worst subjects, the worst subjects in senior high school in the 21st year were Mathematics and Foreign Languages, and the worst subjects in junior high school were Mathematics, Science, and Foreign Languages. In the 22nd year, the worst subjects in senior high school were Mathematics, Foreign Languages, and Physics, and the worst subjects in junior high school were Foreign Languages, Mathematics, and Chinese Language. In the 23rd year, the worst subject in senior high school was Mathematics, and the worst subjects in junior high school were Foreign Languages, Science, and Mathematics. If we look at the three years as a whole, regardless of senior or junior high school, the better subjects are Party Principles and Chinese Language, and History and Geography are also good, while the worst subjects are Foreign Languages, Mathematics, Science, and Science, etc. In view of this major defect, the Ministry of Education has implemented three measures to remedy it: (1) revising the curriculum standards; starting from the second year of senior high school, mathematics teaching is divided into groups, with more time for Group A and no change in curriculum content, and less time and lower content for Group B, so that students can choose to study according to their interests and gain solid proficiency; (2) vigorously promoting teacher training; summer training courses have been held continuously for four years, with special emphasis on mathematics and science, and the methods of training and selection are becoming more and more strict; (3) manufacturing scientific instruments; since the 24th year [1935], the Ministry of Education has jointly allocated funds with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees and the China Cultural and Educational Foundation Committee to entrust the Physics Research Institute of the Academia Sinica to manufacture domestic scientific instruments according to the standards of science equipment for senior and junior high schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education, and sell them to high schools across the country at reduced prices. In the 25th year [1936], this plan was further expanded and continued to be implemented. In the future, all schools must have this standard equipment to improve the efficiency of science teaching. All of these are things that should be done to improve secondary education, but by referring to the results of the exams, we can better choose the order and priority. (To be continued)</p>

As a result, Xu Chengji defeated Cai Huiquan with 7-5, 6-1, and 6-4 to win the championship. Xu defeated the top British player Austin in the singles final last year, and his reputation rose sharply. This year, he was able to maintain the championship, which shows his excellent ball skills. As for the All England Hard Court Tennis, it is an unprecedented event in the history of British tennis for two Chinese players to hold the men's singles final. At the beginning of today's final, Xu Chengji's shots seemed to be unsuccessful, causing Cai Huiquan to win three consecutive games and take the lead with 40-0 in the fourth game. At this point, Xu suddenly cheered up and pulled back two games, but Cai Huiquan won two more games, making the score 5-2. In the eighth game, Cai only needed to win one more point to win this set. This continued for five deuces. Xu Chengji was finally able to win five consecutive games and win the first set with 7-5. In the first game of the second set, the two sides tied for half a hand as many as 14 times, which Cai Huiquan still won. But after that, Xu's shots were fierce, and he won six consecutive games and won the second set with a score of 6-1. By the time of the third set, Xu's remaining courage was commendable, and he launched a fierce attack and won again with 6-4, winning the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Hoarding Households Intentionally Manipulate Rice Market Chaotic Yesterday Morning Major Households Buy In Large Quantities Attempting to Disrupt All Kinds of National Rice Rise to Maximum Limit Rice Industry Decides to Report to Authorities for Investigation <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>After the joint meeting of various rice industry groups resolved the price limit of national rice and implemented it effectively, the rice market resumed business the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, someone bought in large quantities in the market, causing the prices of all kinds of national rice to rise to the limit. The market management committee and the evaluation committee have secretly investigated the rice owners and reported to the authorities for investigation of speculation and manipulation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Market Chaos Serious Situation</p>
<p>After the resumption of business in the soybean and rice industry market the day before yesterday, all transactions were handled in accordance with the price limit set by the association. At the opening of the market at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, someone bought in large quantities, causing the prices of all kinds of national rice to rise to the highest limit, and some even exceeded the price limit. The market management committee members Fu Qian Geng and Wang Tian Chou tried their best to persuade them to correct it and solemnly declared that they would be severely punished in accordance with the penalty rules and would never be lenient, that is, each of the three parties in the first transaction, the intermediary, would be fined one yuan per stone, the second time would be doubled, and the third time would be doubled again. Therefore, all transactions were still within the price limit. Fearing that improper transactions would occur again, the market closed early at 11:10 AM, but the situation was quite serious, the market order was chaotic, and the general public in the market felt that the price of rice would continue to rise, so they all placed orders. The honest and wealthy residents bought and stored in large quantities, from ten to twenty stones. At the same time, the retail sales of rice stores were also crowded. The rice stores reduced the quantity of zero sales and advised residents that the rice reserves in Shanghai were sufficient and there was no need to panic, hoping that all sectors would not worry too much and cause disturbances in the market.</p>
<p>Hoarding Households Manipulate Decided to Punish Severely</p>
<p>The market management committee and the evaluation committee, in view of the fact that Shanghai's rice reserves are still abundant and there will be no shortage or panic, reasonably and logically, the price of rice will not rise so sharply. This improper rise is obviously manipulated and disrupted by someone. If it is not severely punished, it will be impossible to stabilize the price of rice and make it impossible for the management committee to implement the price limit. Therefore, the authorities decided after consultation to send personnel to secretly investigate the names of rice owners in Shanghai, and those who hoard and speculate will be reported to the authorities for investigation, crack down on dark trading and speculation by non-industry people, effectively implement the price limit, and severely punish them in accordance with the prescribed penalty rules.</p>
<p>Large Absorption Difficult Turnover</p>
<p>According to the market, Shanghai's rice reserves, according to the latest survey, are about 600,000 bags, which is still sufficient and will not cause panic, and in fact, the number is still more than this, which is enough to supply the people's food for three or four months. However, two-thirds of the rice reserves are in the hands of non-industry silver and money industries and wealthy warehouses, who are unwilling to release it, hoarding and monopolizing. At the same time, the Suzhou Tongli Ba Chai and other gangs, although they hold rice reserves, are also unwilling to sell it, so the market's spot position is short, and the turnover of transactions is difficult, and those wealthy people disregard the food of more than 4 million citizens in Shanghai, only seeking personal profit, not only unwilling to release it, but also continue to absorb it in large quantities, which is the biggest reason for the current situation. Although the source in the inland is difficult, if there is no speculator to manipulate, the price of rice in Shanghai will not be so serious.</p>
<p>Evaluation Committee Scheduled to Meet</p>
<p>The Rice Evaluation Committee, organized by various rice industry groups in the city, in view of the current unstable situation in the Shanghai rice market, which is of great concern to the future of people's food, has scheduled a temporary meeting in the coming days to thoroughly discuss the matter. The members of the committee now have various relatively perfect methods to be put forward for discussion at the meeting. Representatives of the rice industry groups will report everything in detail to the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce today.</p>

<p>Yu Lin Bao reported that the Japanese side has taken diplomatic procedures for the administration of the two foreign-administered areas in Shanghai. The Japanese Consul General Miura visited the French Consul General Baudoin at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 6th) to protest against the current situation of the Special Court and the Jiangsu High Court in the French Concession. It is said that Baudoin promised to give considerable consideration to this issue. At that time, Miura claimed that the situation had changed after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. In order to better maintain peace and order, he hoped that the French authorities would cooperate with the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" that governs the four suburbs of Shanghai. He also said that the Sino-French Court in the French Concession, which is composed of judges appointed by the Chongqing government, tries cases related to anti-Japanese activities. This situation is inappropriate under the current situation, and he finally asked the French Consul General to take measures to reform this situation.</p>

<p>After Wang Jingwei flew to Shanghai ten days ago, his followers, such as Zhou Fohai and Li Shengwu, also arrived in Shanghai one after another. Wang immediately sent his cronies to carry out activities everywhere. His plan is to restore the past reorganization faction, set up a "Reorganization Comrades Association", absorb Kuomintang members, recruit bandits from various places, organize a "Republic of China National Salvation Army" to support his organization of the "government", and buy off news organizations to promote peace for him. His wife Chen Bijun is in charge of attracting women from all walks of life in Shanghai and preparing to organize a "Women's National Salvation Association". Wang Chen's conspiracy to undermine the war of resistance has long been spurned by the Chinese people, and they are even less self-aware. Recently, they have set up an "office" in the Broadway Building on North Suzhou Road, singing and dancing alone, which is no different from a farce. The Chinese people all scoff at it.</p>

<p>American expatriates in Shanghai have a tradition of gathering for a celebratory meal every year on Mother's Day. This year, Mother's Day falls on May 14th (according to the rule that Mother's Day is the first day of the second week of May; Western custom considers Sunday the first day of each week, so the second day of the second week is the 14th). The families of officers of the U.S. Fourth Naval District and all the officers and crew of the Asiatic Fleet's "Augusta" and "Marblehead" ships, because the "Marblehead" is scheduled to leave Shanghai today to cruise in North China, held a luncheon at the U.S. Navy YMCA yesterday noon to bid farewell to the officers of the "Marblehead." More than two hundred officers and crew members attended. A grand dinner with musical entertainment will be held on the evening of the 14th of this month, and Father Fycherland will also be present.</p>

<p>Japanese Military Police Rushed to the Scene; One-Third Already Burned</p>
<p>The Japanese military grain warehouse at the old Longhua Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was suddenly set on fire by plainclothes agents the night before last. Japanese military police rushed to the scene upon hearing the news to extinguish the fire, but one-third had already been burned. They immediately dispatched teams to search in all directions, but the plainclothes agents, seeing that their goal had been achieved, had already taken the opportunity to escape. It is learned that the Japanese warehouse is located on Longhua Road next to the station, which was formerly the address of China National Aviation Corporation.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Although Shanghai Customs Trade Gradually Recovers, the Import Surplus is Alarming; While the Government Strives to Eliminate the Import Surplus, This is Something All People in Shanghai Should be Ashamed of <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai, due to its superior location and convenient transportation, has seen its industry become increasingly prosperous, thus becoming the trade center and economic hub of the entire country, and the only major port in the Far East. After the war, the center of finance and trade shifted inland, leading to a period of decline, but it has now gradually recovered its former glory. However, the import surplus has increased significantly. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shanghai is the Center of the Entire Country</p>
<p>Since the first year of the Republic of China, the total value of import and export trade has risen from 300 million national currency units to more than 10 billion national currency units, accounting for more than 50% of the total national trade. Before 1919, imports generally accounted for 12% to 18% of the national total, gradually increasing from 1920 to 1927, with the highest rate being 58.96% in 1936. From the first year of the Republic of China to 1919, exports generally accounted for more than 40%, but decreased to around 30% afterwards, increasing again to 50% after 1933.</p>
<p>Post-War Inland Shift; Trade Declines</p>
<p>In 1937, imports were 51,081,100 yuan, accounting for 53.42%, and exports were 40,467,200 yuan, accounting for 48.25%. If the August 13 Incident had not occurred, import and export trade would have increased by another quarter, perhaps setting a new record since the first year of the Republic of China. After the war, due to the inland shift of the financial and trade center, there was a period of decline, but it soon gradually recovered its former glory. For example, in 1938, imports were 27,489,600 yuan, accounting for 30.77%, and exports were 22,303,900 yuan, accounting for 29.20%.</p>
<p>Shanghai Customs Trade Gradually Recovers its Old Appearance</p>
<p>Since the third quarter of last year, trade at Shanghai Customs has gradually recovered its former appearance. For example, in the first quarter of this year, imports were 128,900,900 yuan, accounting for 46.97%, and exports were 81,331,000 yuan, accounting for 41.80%. Comparing this to the same quarter of last year, imports were 52,800,500 yuan, accounting for 22.95%, and exports were 33,698,000 yuan, accounting for 25.10%, indicating that the increase in import and export trade was 123,737,000 yuan, proving that Shanghai Customs trade is gradually recovering.</p>
<p>Increased Import Surplus; People of Shanghai Should be Ashamed</p>
<p>Shanghai is in a fallen area, and the Jianghai Customs was forced to change to a "five-color flag," and tax revenue was deposited in the Japanese Zhengjin Bank. With the increase in Japanese customs officers, the Chinese government has many orders that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs cannot implement. The plan to eliminate the import surplus cannot be realized by Shanghai Customs. Although trade is gradually recovering, the import surplus has increased instead of decreasing. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the import surplus was 47,578,000 yuan, an increase of 28,471,000 yuan compared to the 19,100,700 yuan in the same quarter last year. This is something that all people in Shanghai should be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Imported Foreign Goods; Japan Ranks First</p>
<p>A New Voice News Agency reporter learned from customs officials yesterday that the import of Japanese goods has jumped to the top position in trade with China since May of last year. For example, in the first quarter of this year, it was 71,388,000 yuan, an increase of 23,375,000 yuan compared to the second-place United States with 48,013,000 yuan. The import of Japanese goods, except for customs in North China, is mainly through Shanghai Customs, and Japanese goods have disappeared from customs in the southwestern fallen areas. These Japanese goods are being dumped in the fallen areas, the main reason being that the tax rate in Shanghai was arbitrarily modified, providing various conveniences for the import of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Improved Trade; Sharp Increase in Merchant Ships</p>
<p>As trade at Shanghai Customs gradually recovers, the traffic of foreign merchant ships has also increased sharply, ranking first among all customs in the country. For example, in January of this year, there were 280 ships entering and leaving, with a tonnage of 1,181,478 tons; in February, there were 260 ships entering and leaving, with a tonnage of 1,189,993 tons; and in March, there were 295 ships entering and leaving, with a tonnage of 1,263,901 tons. In the first quarter of this year, there were a total of 835 ships, with a tonnage of 3,639,372 tons. However, the most frequent ships were Japanese merchant ships. For example, in the first quarter of this year, there were 1,545 Japanese merchant ships entering and leaving the country, with a tonnage of 2,526,387 tons, ranking first among all countries.</p>

<p>Ten Thousand Bags of Imported Rice to be Shipped for Relief; Awaiting Approval</p>
<p>The rice supply in Zhejiang Province is insufficient to meet its own needs. Since the war, the population has concentrated in eastern Zhejiang, causing rice prices in Ningbo and Shaoxing to reach 18 or 19 yuan. However, since the port of Ningbo was blockaded, the source has been cut off. Therefore, the local chamber of commerce contacted the Ningbo natives association in Shanghai to purchase imported rice to regulate the food supply in various parts of eastern Zhejiang, totaling 50,000 bags. It is planned to first ship 10,000 bags for emergency relief. Currently, the relevant parties have submitted a request to the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters and Martial Law Headquarters for permission to ship rice into the port. Once approved, ships can be hired for transportation.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the anniversary of the National Humiliation of May 9th. After consultation by all sectors of the city, the people of the entire city will have a vegetarian diet for one day to express their grief. In previous years, flags were flown at half-mast on this day, but this year, because May 9th is not within the date jointly agreed upon by various groups for flying flags, all organizations, groups, schools, and shops will not fly flags at half-mast. It is hoped that all sectors of the city will endure the pain and comply.</p>

<p>The Yulin News reports that Lieutenant Colonel Hayashi of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, along with two other Japanese personnel, Thomas of the British Consulate, and Deputy Police Commissioner McCloskey of the Public Concession Police Department, visited Western Police Officer Wimmett at Gongji Hospital yesterday (the 6th) for approximately forty minutes. During this time, Wimmett gave an account of the accident on Broadway Road on the evening of April 24th, in which Li Li died and Li Li's wife and Wimmett were seriously injured. The content of his statement has not been released, but it is said to be consistent with the circumstances of the accident as described by Mrs. Li. Last night, rumors spread that the Japanese authorities opposed transferring Wimmett away from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. A certain person replied to reporters that this statement was fabricated and that there were no plans to move Wimmett, so the rumored possible opposition from the Japanese authorities was absolutely inaccurate.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Difficult Resumption of Shanghai-Wenzhou Shipping; Shanghai-Dinghai勉强勉强 <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Hana Arrives in Dinghai Twice with Limited Passengers and Cargo; Shanghai-Wenzhou Line Unstable; Fuzhou Line Postponed Again; Gordon Arrested; Passengers Executed by Gunshot</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Dinghai lines, after the Zhejiang East, Wenzhou-Taizhou, and Ningbo Garrison Commander approved the resumption of foreign shipping, only the Shanghai-Dinghai line has勉强勉强 resumed operations. As for the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, the situation along the coast of eastern Zhejiang has become tense again. Currently, only the Lisheng轮 of Jardine Matheson's Fuzhou route is arriving in Shanghai via Wenzhou. Other ships, such as the Moufu and Haifu, are still unable to resume operations. As for the detained Italian merchant ship De Ping, negotiations are ongoing. A young passenger on the German merchant ship Gordon, owned by the German firm Luhlin &amp; Co., was arrested and shot. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hana Returns to Shanghai After Two Trips to Dinghai</p>
<p>The Hana輪, owned by the German firm 速东, left Shanghai for Dinghai on the 3rd of this month. After being intercepted and inspected by a Japanese warship in the (Peninsula) waters, it proceeded to Dinghai to load cargo and passengers. It then returned to Shanghai from Dinghai at 4:00 p.m. on the 6th and arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 a.m. yesterday, berthing at Roosevelt Wharf. It carried over six hundred pieces of cargo and more than two hundred passengers. The same day, it was decided to directly release it from Shanghai to Dinghai. Customs clearance for passengers and cargo was not crowded.</p>
<p>Difficult Resumption of Smooth Shipping on the Shanghai-Wenzhou Line</p>
<p>After the resumption of shipping on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line was approved by the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Commander, the Moufu and Haifu, two ships owned by the German firm 礼和洋行, were originally scheduled to resume operations first. However, due to the gathering of Japanese warships along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, which seemed to have intentions, the situation suddenly became tense. As a result, the two ships repeatedly postponed their departure to Wenzhou. It is now learned that the Moufu输 is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Wenzhou tomorrow morning (the 9th). However, whether it will depart on schedule or be postponed again will depend on the situation in Wenzhou-Taizhou. Therefore, apart from the Lisheng輪 of the Fuzhou route of the British firm Jardine Matheson, which arrived in Shanghai from Minwan to Wenzhou on the 6th, the Nanning轮 of the Taikoo Dockyard, which sails from Hong Kong to Wenzhou, may or may not arrive in Shanghai. There is no definite news yet. Apart from these, although other ships are approved for resumption of operations in fact, there are no foreign ships officially sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Detained De Ping Still Under Negotiation</p>
<p>The De Ping轮, an Italian merchant ship owned by the Italian firm 中意公司, which was temporarily hired by the Ningbo Natives Association in Shanghai to handle emergency relief matters for fellow villagers in Ningbo, was forced to return to Shanghai and is berthed at buoy number 20 on the Yangshupu River, under the surveillance of Japanese warships. It has been many days since there has been any news of its release. According to a reporter from the Daguang News Agency, the authorities of the ship have reported the situation to the Italian Consulate in Shanghai, which has lodged representations with the Japanese side. The Japanese Consul-General Miura has not given a specific reply regarding the detention of the ship. Therefore, the Italian Consulate is now making representations for the second time based on the company's report, hoping for an early release.</p>
<p>Passengers on the Gordon Executed by Gunshot</p>
<p>The Gordon轮, a German merchant ship owned by the German firm 鲁麟洋行, which operates on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, was reportedly detained by a Japanese warship and brought to Shanghai. It is still berthed at buoy number 21, with no news of its release. According to a reporter from the Daguang News Agency, one of the young passengers on the ship, who boarded in Ningbo to come to Shanghai, had a piece of paper with symbols on it when he was detained and inspected by the Japanese warship. After being taken to the Japanese warship, he was executed by gunshot.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the war, there have been many developments in China's financial industry, and the discussion of post-war financial issues is also extremely important. At present, the economic situation abroad is changing rapidly, and there are many areas that China's financial industry can learn from. It is learned that Chen Guangfu, the general manager of Shanghai Bank, has always paid close attention to sending personnel to observe the banking business in Europe and the United States. In addition to previously sending Wu Kejia and Zi Yaoyun to the United States, this year, Zhang Wuyun, the director of the bank's research department, was again sent to the United States for observation. Mr. Zhang left Shanghai by ship for the United States via Hong Kong a few days ago.</p>

They all praised the sanatorium for its large gardens, quiet location, clean wards, and low fees, making it a perfect place for treatment in an isolated island. The weather was clear that day, and in its large gardens, hundreds of guests and friends gathered, making it feel like a spring outing.</p>

<p>Officially Approve</p>
<p>and then proceed with the arrangements for "Safety First, No Accidents Week" and begin a long-term campaign to reduce the number of traffic casualties in the Public Concession. The various subcommittees of the committee have studied the complex traffic problems in Shanghai caused by crowded pedestrians and vehicles. Last year, 165 people died in traffic accidents, several times more than in 1936 and 1937. The area of the Public Concession</p>
<p>Has Been Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>and the population has nearly tripled compared to before the war. Countless refugees have come to Shanghai from the inland, and very few have seen electric lights or traffic signals. The committee is now facing this problem. As the commercial docks and warehouses on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek have been occupied by the Japanese, the Bund has become the most important dock, and the number of trucks traveling on the Bund has doubled, making the situation even more serious. According to Baker, during the chaos in Shanghai from 1932 to 1935, the Police Department taught the</p>
<p>Public Concession</p>
<p>residents about the dangers of traffic-congested streets, and accidents were greatly reduced. Therefore, it is necessary to teach the new residents who have arrived here. According to Purling, the treasurer of the executive committee, the details of the report cannot be published until the Municipal Council has responded. However, this campaign will be purely educational in nature,</p>
<p>Using Posters,</p>
<p>Movie Theaters and Lectures as Mediums. Police officers said they acknowledge that enforcing strict traffic laws is useless if pedestrians do not know how to avoid being arrested. The authorities also said that they will inform the public of the dangers of traffic in big cities at any time by all possible means, and they believe that the public will abide by traffic rules.</p>

<p>Medicines on Board Have Not Been Returned; Donations for Disaster Relief in Ningbo are Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The Ningbo Natives Association in Shanghai hired relief personnel to go to Ningbo and sailed directly to Ningbo on the De Ping轮 on the 1st. However, because a Japanese warship was firing at the Zhenhai Estuary, it was unable to enter the port. The details have been recorded in the newspapers. The follow-up situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Medicines Have Not Been Returned</p>
<p>After the De Ping轮 returned to Shanghai, the doctors and nurses who were on board to go to Ningbo for relief also returned on the same ship and disembarked at the Xinguantou Pier on a small boat on the 4th. However, the De Ping输 is still berthed at buoy number 30 in Yangshupu, still under surveillance, and the medicines on board have not been unloaded.</p>
<p>Donations for Relief are Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The Ningbo side has sent a telegram welcoming the ship to Ningbo for relief. However, negotiations between Italy and Japan are still in progress. Therefore, the date for continuing relief efforts in Ningbo will be realized after the negotiations on the De Ping轮 are completed. There is no schedule at this time. Since the Ningbo Natives Association urgently raised funds for disaster relief in Ningbo, donors have been very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Cantonese merchant Guan Xinglou is enthusiastic about charity and cares about his hometown. Recently, his son Chaolun got married. In light of the national crisis, the ceremony was simplified. The disaster in his hometown is severe, and the people in need of relief are numerous. He specially donated two hundred yuan of national currency, which would have been used for the banquet expenses for relatives and friends, to the Guangdong Natives Association in Shanghai Disaster Relief for Relief of Guangdong and Guangxi Refugees Donation Committee to be used for relief of refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi. Guan's move benefits both relatives and friends and provides relief to fellow countrymen, which can be said to achieve two good things in one stroke.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Jewish Refugees Arrive in a Steady Stream; The Problem of Supplies is Serious <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Four Thousand Will Arrive This Month; Committee is Extremely Anxious; Italian Ship Arrived Yesterday with More Than Four Hundred, Who Have Been Separately Accommodated; The Number of Refugees Suffering from Scarlet Fever Has Increased to Seventy-Five</p>
<p>The 大报 reports that according to statistics from the European Jewish Refugee Committee, there are now about 7,500 German Jewish refugees in Shanghai. If the number of refugees scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this month can be seen as a precursor to the future, then the number may double in less than three months. It is expected that seven large ships and ten to twelve smaller ships will arrive from Europe this month, carrying</p>
<p>Refugees to Shanghai</p>
<p>Four hundred and fifty men, women, and children are scheduled to arrive here today (the 7th) on the Conte Rosso. It is expected that the President Dume輪 will also arrive next Friday, carrying about three hundred people. The Italian ship 该萨号, which specifically carries refugees to the Far East, will carry another six hundred people and is scheduled to arrive here on May 15th. In the same month, another Japanese ship will arrive from Europe with one hundred immigrants. The German ship</p>
<p>桑霍斯号</p>
<p>will arrive in Shanghai on May 19th. The Italian ship Victoria号 will arrive on the 22nd, and a certain Japanese ship sailing from Europe on a fixed date will carry an unknown number of refugees. In addition, ten to twelve smaller ships sailing from Europe to Shanghai this month will also carry refugees. According to unconfirmed rumors, two German ships carrying 1,300 refugees are currently taking the route through South Africa to Shanghai. This has caused the members of the European Jewish Relief Committee to</p>
<p>Have Sleepless Nights</p>
<p>It is heard that the two ships are specifically carrying refugees who have been expelled from Central Europe by the German secret police. In short, many believe that more than 4,000 refugees have already set off and will arrive in Shanghai this month. A small number may land in Manila. According to reliable news recently received from the Philippines, there are</p>
<p>500 Jewish Refugees Residing</p>
<p>there. According to the Continental News, the Shanghai Jewish Refugee Committee was busy yesterday (the 6th) preparing to care for the 450 Jewish immigrants who were scheduled to arrive here this afternoon (the 7th) on the Conte Rosso. Immigrants suffering from scarlet fever continue to be sent to the temporary isolation hospital on Zhaofeng Road. According to the latest figures obtained last night, the number of Jewish refugees suffering from scarlet fever has increased to seventy-five, most of whom come from various shelters in Hongkou and are mostly adults. The charity performance scheduled to be held at the Riverside Apartments on Tuesday evening has been cancelled, out of fear of possible</p>
<p>Transmission of This Disease</p>
<p>Although this situation is indeed serious, a member of the committee told reporters last night that the number of new cases of this disease has indeed decreased. Since Wednesday, about twenty people have been infected with this disease every day, but yesterday there were only about fifteen people. The work of caring for the sick is being handled by a sufficient</p>
<p>Number of Volunteers</p>
<p>from among the Jewish refugees. The general public believes that the spread of scarlet fever was introduced by some of the newly arrived Jewish refugees, as scarlet fever has not been widely prevalent in Shanghai before. It is heard that the Municipal Council Health Department is now fully cooperating with the Refugee Committee. When the scarlet fever epidemic first broke out, the Municipal Council set aside fifteen beds in the Chinese</p>
<p>Isolation Hospital</p>
<p>for their treatment, but it immediately became clear that this was not enough. It was then decided to hastily organize a temporary treatment center on Zhaofeng Road. The Conte Rosso, which carried 450 Jewish refugees, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at about 2:00 p.m. and the passenger ship is expected to reach the Customs Wharf at about 4:00 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e79">A Glimpse of the Enthusiasm of Small Cloth Vendors for Disaster Relief <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Most of the small cloth vendors in this city operate on a small scale, but they are quite enthusiastic about disaster relief. After being urged by the collection committee of the association's trade group, a meeting was held to decide to collect monthly donations, which has been implemented since last month. Yesterday, the collection method and the donations collected in April were reported to the trade group by letter. The original letter is excerpted below: We have received your letter asking about the implementation method of our association's collection of relief funds for refugees. Most of our members are small business employees, and their salaries are very low. In this time of rising prices, it is already difficult to maintain a livelihood, and there is really no extra money to donate for disaster relief again. However, our association has witnessed the tragic situation of the refugees and cannot bear to stand idly by. After convening a meeting, it was decided to ask each member to donate individually, based on the size of each member's business, divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Class A is three yuan, Class B is one yuan, and Class C is five jiao. Staff members are sent to collect them at the end of the month and remit them to your association. We are now sending the list of the number of donations collected in April, along with the bank receipt, for your inspection and receipt. This small amount is only to fulfill the obligations of fellow countrymen and is not enough to talk about relief. We hope to be excused.</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Visit of Lin Kanghou (1) <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou, originally named Zu Jin, is a native of Shanghai. He was born in the second year of the Qing Guangxu Emperor's reign (1875 in the Western calendar), and is currently sixty-four years old. He has served society and dedicated himself to the financial world, enjoying a long-standing reputation. He currently serves as the Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, concurrently the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Banking Association, Supervisor of the Central Bank, Member and Secretary-General of the National Debt Fund Management Committee, Secretary-General of the China Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce, Director of the National Government Construction Committee Electrical Public Debt Fund Custody Committee, Executive Director of the Chinese Red Cross Society, and concurrently as Education Committee member of the Shanghai First Special District Municipal Council, Chairman of the Citizens' Federation, and Trustee and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of St. John's University, Aurora University, Kwang Hua University, and various primary and secondary schools in Shanghai. His prestige in society is evident from this.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 19th, I visited Mr. Lin at his office. He greeted me with humility and invited me to sit across from him at his desk. I was surprised by Mr. Lin's youthfulness, because although he is sixty-four years old this year, he looks no more than forty years old. He was wearing a Western suit, and his spirits were high. He wore a longevity badge commemorating the centenary of Mr. Ma Xiangbo on his chest. The daily calendar on his desk clearly recorded his necessary tasks, which showed that his official duties kept him very busy and he was strict with himself. We talked for about two hours. He answered many things in continuous phone calls, which also showed his quickness in handling matters.</p>
<p>Visiting Mr. Lin, of course, meant talking about financial issues, and how could I be an exception. Mr. Lin was always smiling and very amiable. He said that finance is a part of the economy, and finance and economic construction are connected. Development in construction means lively finance. With the current rapid economic construction, the development of the financial future can certainly be determined. Then, he talked about the situation of the banking industry in Shanghai. He said: Before "August 13th," the number of banks in Shanghai was one hundred, and forty-four joined the Banking Association. Since the start of the war, the banking industry has suffered the rage of extraordinary times. At that time, I felt that as long as everyone could unite as one, their strength would surely overcome the difficulties. In the face of this great disaster, we should assist everyone, regardless of whether they are members, not distinguish between each other, and share the difficulties together, using surplus to make up for deficiencies. This is the manifestation of the spirit of mutual assistance. At that time, thanks to the sympathy and cooperation of all parties, we were able to create an unprecedented strong barrier for the Shanghai banking community in this extraordinary period. Until now, all banks still maintain a ring of mutual assistance, and no one feels difficult to cope. This proves that the consolidation of unity is essential for all undertakings. Recently, various banks have been established one after another. I often use two points to encourage them with friendship: first, take care of credit, and second, do not speculate. He also said that he entered the banking industry in the third year of the Republic of China (1914). In addition to accepting entrustments from customers, he has never engaged in speculative activities such as buying gold in his life. Therefore, for more than twenty years, I am fortunate to have not been abandoned by all circles. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e81">Funeral of Cao Bingsheng, Chief Inspector of the Political Department of the French Concession Police <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The funeral will be held today at the Shanghai Funeral Parlor. Some of the suspects have been released.</p>
<p>Cao Bingsheng, Chief Inspector of the Political Department of the French Concession Police, was murdered on the side of Avenue West, at 7:50 AM the day before yesterday. He died of his injuries at 4:30 PM that afternoon. The details of the event have been reported in this newspaper. Here are more messages obtained by the reporters of the news agency.</p>
<p>Today's Funeral</p>
<p>Since Mr. Cao's body was transferred to the Shanghai Funeral Parlor on Route Tenant de la Tour yesterday evening, it has been decided that the funeral will be held at 1:00 PM today and the burial will be held at 2:00 PM tomorrow. Mr. Cao's coffin is made of teak and was purchased from Hu Yuchang's store on Avenue Petain for 1,100 yuan by Mr. Cao's family. At the same time, Mr. Cao's clothing for the encoffining will be a blue robe and a black mandarin jacket, a traditional Chinese dress. Yesterday morning, people from all walks of life and personnel from various institutions under the French Municipal Council went to pay their condolences. The French Defense Forces Command also sent ADC Dai to represent them in offering condolences.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Burial</p>
<p>The route of Mr. Cao's funeral procession has not yet been determined. Because yesterday was a regular Sunday holiday, Mr. Cao's family originally planned for the procession to go through Avenue Edward VII, but this road usually does not allow processions to pass through, so it will be determined after the authorities approve it today. The route is approximately from the Shanghai Funeral Parlor, via Route Foo Loh Lee, Route Cardinal Mercier, turning to Route Lugny. Via Avenue Dubail, then along Route Yu Hsu, Route Albert, Avenue West and other places. Because the problem was not resolved yesterday, it is feared that the burial today will be too late, so it is specially postponed to tomorrow afternoon. At that time, all members of the French Concession Police, except those who cannot leave their posts, will go to hold the ropes of the hearse.</p>
<p>Burial Site</p>
<p>Regarding the question of Mr. Cao's burial, most people in the police force believe that since he died in the line of duty, they all advocated burial in the Western cemetery on the side of Route Sapey and Route Conty. However, those buried in this cemetery are all French nationals, and only those who have made contributions to France can be buried with steles. Mr. Cao is not French, which may be inconvenient, so the problem has not been resolved as of press time. It also depends on the attitude of the French authorities today.</p>
<p>Release of Suspects</p>
<p>After the Cao Bingsheng murder case occurred the day before yesterday, in addition to the injured Wang Tingsheng from Tianjin, who was captured on the spot as a major suspect, and another suspect, the police immediately mobilized all members to investigate separately. At that time, a total of twenty-two suspects were arrested in No. 22 Baoyu Lane and the Taiping Tea House on Caishi Road. After being taken to the police station for a thorough investigation, they were all released yesterday because they had nothing to do with the case. However, Wang and others are still being secretly interrogated. It is also heard that the police authorities believe that Mr. Cao was loyal to his duties during his lifetime and his contributions were great, so they plan to provide generous compensation to comfort his spirit, and on the one hand, strictly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily News on the 7th, Cao Bingsheng, the chief of the political department of the French Concession Police, was assassinated and died yesterday. It is heard that the reason for his murder was revenge by a certain criminal.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Renfeng Factory Manager Files an Appeal <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Civil lawsuit settled amicably. The factory is preparing to resume operations.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, located in Hongkou, made huge profits due to the management of a certain commodity, resulting in uneven distribution of profits. Therefore, the factory director, Xu Tingyu, hired lawyers E Sen and Zhang Fayao to privately prosecute the factory's general manager, Zhu Gengtao, and Zhang Zixin of Xinchang Cotton Cloth Store in the criminal court of the Second Special District Court for the crime of breach of trust and embezzlement. Then, Xie Keming, the former factory director of Renfeng Factory, also privately prosecuted Zhu Gengtao for two embezzlement cases in the criminal court of the Second Special District Court, and each filed an attached civil lawsuit. It occurred in the early summer of last year. During the trial, the court changed the judge in charge of the case several times for the sake of prudence. Then Judge Qiu Huanxing combined the two cases for trial. After a year, the civil lawsuit part was settled amicably through friendly mediation between the two parties. The criminal lawsuit part was also concluded in the past month. Zhu Gengtao was sentenced to six months imprisonment for each of the two embezzlement cases, and was sentenced to ten months imprisonment. Zhang Zixin was sentenced to six months imprisonment, with a two-year suspended sentence. The details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Now it is learned that Zhu Gengtao and Zhang Zixin were not convinced by the first instance judgment, so after receiving the judgment, they requested the original trial court to clarify the appeal in accordance with the law and detailed the reasons for their dissatisfaction, requesting the case files to be checked and transferred to a higher-level court for verification. The Second Special District Court has filed a statement and checked all the case files, and sent them to the Third Branch of the High Court. The trial will be conducted soon. Moreover, since the last friendly mediation, Xu, Xie and Zhu have released their suspicions and reconciled, and are preparing to return to the original site of the Renfeng Factory in Hongkou to reorganize the factory affairs and resume operations soon.</p>

<p>After one and a half years, less than half of the destruction has been completed. It is expected that it will be difficult to open up shipping within a year.</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen sunken ships in the Sixteenth Wharf Blockade Line. The Japanese are now trying to speed up the bombing in the hope of completing the work within the next year. The contract signed by the Japanese who contracted the project to destroy the blockade line stipulates that it must be completed in two and a half years. One and a half years have passed, but less than half of the destruction work has been completed. There are still eleven or twelve sunken ships at the bottom of the river, which has caused infinite worries. They are actively stepping up the bombing. For the iron plates that have been blown open, there is no time to salvage them for the time being, and they are allowed to sink to the bottom of the river. It is believed that the water flow there is turbulent and the bombing is difficult. It is still difficult to be optimistic about opening up the waterway in a year.</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Assailant Who Chopped at a Night Soil Collector and His Son Received a Suspended Sentence <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The appeal was judged the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the usual practice of the cleaning bureaus in this city, all night soil collectors' dumping of night soil is done in designated sections of the cleaning bureau, and they do not infringe on each other. In September of last year, Dai Wenguang, a night soil collector from the newly opened Sanyi Silk Factory at No. 96 Macao Road, West Shanghai, did not obtain the consent of the Yichang Road Pier Cleaning Bureau, which had jurisdiction over the area. He took the cart to the factory without permission.</p>
<p>Dumping Night Soil</p>
<p>He was discovered by Chen Fengyi, an inspector from the bureau, who is from Haimen. Chen stepped forward to intervene, accusing Dai of violating the bureau's regulations. After mediation, Dai temporarily relinquished the night soil dumping work at the factory. Chen Fengyi sent another night soil collector to take over. On November 25th, Dai saw that Chen did not return the night soil dumping work at the factory to him, so he went to the factory to dump night soil again. Although Chen and others</p>
<p>Intervened</p>
<p>It was ineffective. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 27th of the same month, at 5:00 AM, Dai Wenguang and his father, Dai Yongshou, were pushing the cart to work at the Sanyi Factory when they were suddenly lured into a nearby alley and chopped in the head and buttocks with an axe. The murderers fled in a panic. The case was reported to the police station. The detectives from the Putuo Road Police Station found that Chen Fengyi and another corner cleaning bureau</p>
<p>Inspector</p>
<p>Chen Buchuan, and Sha Yaozhang, a night soil cart driver from No. 109, were the murderers in this case. They were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. According to the testimonies of the plaintiffs Dai Wenguang and his son and the witness Shen Zhengyan, the court sentenced Chen Fengyi to one year and six months imprisonment, Sha Yaozhang to eight months imprisonment, and Chen Buchuan to six months imprisonment. Chen and the other three were sentenced</p>
<p>Not Convinced</p>
<p>They hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. In their appeal, they pointed out that the plaintiffs were actually making false accusations out of resentment, and that Shen Zhengyan's testimony was completely false. They requested a reversal of the injustice. After hearing the case by the Second Branch of the High Court, Judge Yu Huating announced the verdict the day before yesterday, rejecting Chen and others' appeal, but granting Chen and others a five-year suspended sentence.</p>

<p>The light bulbs were broken, but fortunately it did not explode. The reason is that it sells certain goods.</p>
<p>Lao Xiedaxiang Silk and Cloth Store on Avenue Foch, south of the Great World, in the French Concession, is exclusively owned by Mr. Sun from Nanhui and managed by Mr. Min. Because it has been selling certain goods over the years, its business has been very prosperous and it has made huge profits, making it the leader among its peers in Shanghai. It is heard that its profits last year reached more than one million gold. Last month, someone using the name of the Youth Iron Blood Corps threw a grenade into the store. After a while, a large number of leaflets were thrown from the roof of the store, spreading warnings. The details were briefly reported in the newspaper. Then, at 7:30 PM the day before yesterday (the 5th), when the Xiedaxiang store was still open for business, a radical element threw a grenade into the store. Fortunately, it landed without exploding, only breaking a light bulb, so no one was injured. However, the customers and shop assistants in the store were shocked and ran away in a panic. Later, the store manager picked up and hid the unexploded grenade and did not report it to the police station.</p>

<p>One person was arrested by the Japanese.</p>
<p>After the Japanese issued a batch of guns to the puppet "Police Sub-bureau" in Gaoqiao, Pudong, more than a dozen puppet "police" revolted as a group and escaped with weapons last year. Later, it was learned that they had also joined the guerrillas. The Japanese and puppet sides paid special attention to this and investigated it very strictly. Li Rong, a native of Hebei, was walking on Dongchang Road in a Western suit yesterday when he was discovered and arrested by the puppet "police station," but he was not carrying any weapons.</p>

<p>In the brothel founded by Feng Lushi, sister of Zhu Lushi, at No. 14 Zhihe Lane, the three girls were locked up upstairs and forced to become prostitutes. The three girls refused. After three days, Feng Zhengbiao (a Chinese police officer from the Old Gate Police Station), Feng Lushi's husband, released the three young girls He, Chen, and Gao. After the incident, Xu Huanqing, a detective sent by the Putuo Road Police Station, arrested Deng Yangshi, Zhang Wangshi, Zhu Lushi, and other three women and escorted them to the First Special District Court for interrogation.

<p>Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, said that</p>
<p>Chinese Police Officer Feng Zhengbiao</p>
<p>No. 1576 from the Old Gate Police Station, had been brought to court for questioning. He claimed that he did ask the three girls to go home and did not lock them up upstairs. He had not seen them when they arrived and did not know anything else. His wife, Feng Lushi, was also listening in the courtroom. Judge Jiang asked her to stand in the defendant's position. Under questioning, she denied forcing the three girls, He, and others into prostitution. When confronted with the testimony of the defendants Deng Yangshi and the other three women, they gave cunning statements and begged for leniency. The court ordered them to be returned to custody and rescheduled the trial. Feng Zhengbiao and Feng Lushi should be detained for investigation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai United Association of Exporters of Chinese National Products has recently received letters and telegrams from customers in Little Luzon regarding the fact that the boxes are not strong, are often damaged, the goods are stolen, and the goods are damp and moldy. Glass and enamel utensils are damaged by more than half because there is too little shredded paper and wood chips in the packaging, and there are even cases where the whole box is lost. As a result, compensation and price reductions occur frequently, and even losses are too great, and orders are canceled by telegram, which is not uncommon. If this continues, the future of national products will be greatly affected. The association, in view of this, so that manufacturers know how to improve, calculate costs, and effectively handle the matter, in order to facilitate the promotion of national products and avoid unexpected losses, (1) Wooden boxes, regardless of size, should be temporarily made of six-point boards, and the outer files should be made of eight-point boards to prevent damage and theft of goods. (2) The inside of the box should be lined with foreign asphalt paper or replaced with a double layer of 120-pound kraft paper made in China to prevent rainwater from leaking into the box. The box boards should be dry to avoid mold. (3) Hot water bottles, glassware, and other goods that are easily damaged should be packaged in commercial miscellaneous paper boxes and filled with one inch of wood chips or paper scraps. The surface of the box should also be printed with the word "小心" ("Careful") in Western characters. (4) The box for enamel utensils should not be too large, and the inside of the box should be filled with one inch of wood chips or paper scraps to ensure safety. (5) Each product should have the words "Made in China" in Western characters. (6) Rice straw is strictly prohibited from being imported by the Little Luzon Customs, so all boxes must not be packed with rice straw and must be replaced with wood chips or paper scraps. (7) The net and gross weight of each product should be prepared separately and marked on each invoice. Headscarves and handkerchiefs should be provided with small samples for customs declaration and delivery by the customer.</p>

<p>Zhao Kong, a monk from Taizhou who was a visiting monk at the Fuguo Temple at No. 4725 Route Robert, recently harbored resentment because he was unsuccessful in borrowing money from the abbot of the temple, Kongci.

They escorted the monk Zhao Kong to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Judge Huang Risheng</p>
<p>Visited the Court for Continued Hearing</p>
<p>Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, said that, according to the examination by the Shanghai Municipal Council chemist, the oxalic acid powder is a scrubbing poison that can prevent blood from clotting and is a dyeing product required in industrial plants. The oxalic acid powder put into the wine bottle by the defendant reached 68 percent. If 60 percent of this oxalic acid is added to various objects and consumed by people, it can be fatal. When Dr. Meng was in the temple, he stated that the powder was</p>
<p>Extremely Potent</p>
<p>Like nitric acid, and the defendant was also informed of this. Therefore, his intention of adding this oxalic acid powder to the wine bottle was not a joke with the abbot monk Kongci, but to harm his life or to seize his position as abbot after his death. He asked for a severe punishment. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. The judge ordered him to be returned to custody and set a date for sentencing.</p>

<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of China Labor University</p>
<p>Increasing love between husband and wife is the key to preserving family peace. But to do this, it is essential to maintain sexual harmony between husband and wife. If one party's sexual organs are abnormal and cannot satisfy the other, then the love between husband and wife will gradually cool, leading to family unhappiness. Tolstoy, Weininger, and others despise carnal desire and advocate asceticism, believing it to be noble, but it cannot be universally applied to ordinary people. Although there have been those who, based on religious beliefs and health concerns, suppressed their impulses, many have done so based on ethical and aesthetic concepts. Therefore, sexual desire is a natural physiological requirement of human beings, used to solidify the love between men and women. If one party's reproductive organs develop a disease or abnormality and cannot satisfy the other, cracks will inevitably appear in the family life. Husband's debauchery, wife's hysteria, divorce, adultery, murder, and other family tragedies often stem from abnormal or discordant sexual life. Moralists who want to correct it with morality and ethics are bound to fail. Mental abnormalities caused by mental reasons cannot be cured without mental therapy. Family tragedies caused by abnormal or discordant sexual life are the same. They cannot succeed without sexual methods. Young men and women who transition from solitary life to married life, experiencing the love between men and women for the first time, often engage in excessive sexual activity, damaging their physical and mental health. Men develop sexual neurasthenia, and women develop uterine diseases and hysteria, leading to the cause of family breakdown. Therefore, indulgence after marriage is a major danger for young men and women, and it can be called the origin of joy turning to sorrow.</p>
<p>Furthermore, newly injured by premarital masturbation will inevitably suffer from premature ejaculation, impotence, neurasthenia, and other symptoms after marriage. With the recent advancement of endocrinology, especially the success of puberty line endocrine in treating sexual neurasthenia, it has reached the realm of clinical application. For example, after suffering from the above symptoms, taking the genuine puberty line lysate for men, "Bu Ti Kang," will make the symptoms disappear. Elderly people can use this drug to increase sperm and tonify the kidneys, and it will show miraculous effects within 24 hours, which is most trusted by our doctors. Its female "Bu Ti Kang" functions to regulate menstruation and promote pregnancy, and it is most effective in treating breast atrophy and anemia.</p>

<p>Patient Gu Hanzhong, 22 years old, an acquaintance (self-reported): I have always been weak and prone to illness. At the age of 19, I discovered coughing. The following spring, I had a lot of thick phlegm, and sometimes blood spots were found. I went to a Chinese medicine practitioner for diagnosis and treatment and was diagnosed with lung disease. After taking medicine, applying plasters, and resting for more than two months, I recovered. I came to Shanghai to make a living, and last fall, I had a slight cough, which I didn't pay much attention to. A few days later, I went out for business and overexerted myself. In the evening, I suddenly coughed up a bowl of blood and was bedridden. The next day, I coughed again, so I was introduced by a friend to consult me (treatment process). I ordered him to rest, eat more nutritious food, not smoke or drink alcohol, and take "Bu Fei Na Er" to treat hemoptysis and eradicate his tuberculosis. After three months of treatment, all symptoms disappeared and health was fully restored.</p>

<p>— Described by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>The difficulty in treating gonorrhea lies in how to eliminate the bacteria's base. This is now the focus of discussion and resolution of gonorrhea. Because gonorrhea is not only focused on the issues of film penetration by the general public, or only limited to the problem of local film penetration sterilization, and only focusing on its surface sterilization problems, and forgetting the problem that gonorrhea is extremely easy to reproduce and multiply, stubborn bacteria that escape and jump around are difficult to apply local extermination, or only eliminate the gonorrhea deposited on the mucous membrane, and think that they have fulfilled the responsibility of completely curing gonorrhea. This is not the case. To fundamentally solve these stubborn gonorrhea, it is necessary to adopt a broad-ranging sterilization therapy to be effective. The only medicine that can meet this ideal is "Ke Lin Nong," invented by Dr. Peter of Germany, which can be proven.</p>
<p>The medicine "Ke Lin Nong" has long been valued by doctors in various countries, so this medicine has been praised and is highly reputable. The reason why this preparation is trusted by general doctors and patients is that this preparation is made based on non-specific therapy, using a mixture of protein bodies and yellow pigments. After thousands of animal experiments and countless clinical experiments by gonorrhea experts from various countries, it was finally successful. It is effective in curing acute gonorrhea, the terrible pain of anterior and posterior urethritis, balanitis, balanoposthitis, purulent blood discharge, and chronic prostatitis, cystitis, arthritis, etc. Because after taking this medicine, anti-gonococcal phagocytic effects can occur within a few hours, which can completely and fundamentally solve and eliminate the gonorrhea that is good at escaping, so the efficacy is very reliable, and it completely cures all leukorrhea without any problems.</p>

I had not seen him for many years, so I wanted to ask about the recent situation in the countryside and went to visit him. He treated me with a grand banquet, and we talked about our feelings after parting and called two singing girls to accompany us to drink and chat. At this time, because I had not been exposed to the world deeply and because I was full of youthful energy, I was fascinated by the songs and colors and got very drunk. My friend then asked me to stay overnight and did this lowly and shameless thing. From then on, I became lost in indulgence, spending my days in revelry and not knowing what I was doing. After several months of excessive indulgence, my kidneys were greatly deficient, my complexion was thin, and my essence and blood were exhausted. I began to realize my mistake, but it was too late. I had suffered too much damage, and nocturnal emission followed, gradually increasing, and my spirit felt even weaker. Although I had taken medicine for treatment, it had no effect. Now the disease has gradually worsened, and I even have the phenomenon of leaking sperm when I see color during the day. Although I hate my past mistakes, it is too late to hate them. I am here to seek treatment (symptoms) — The seminal vesicle is loose, the ejaculation center is too sensitive, the endocrine is exhausted, and the nerves are extremely weak (treatment) — I instructed him to take care of himself, receive electrotherapy for 15 minutes every day, and take "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" to consolidate his seminal vesicle and stop his nocturnal emission. He also took the glandular essence preparation for men, "Bu Ti Kang," to supplement his insufficient endocrine and treat his neurasthenia. With such comprehensive care, after two months of treatment, all symptoms were cured, and he is now a strong and promising young man.</p>

<p>The term "old leukorrhea" is enough to make the average person shudder. And the patient himself, even more so! Therefore, gonorrhea patients, upon hearing that their own symptoms have turned chronic, are invariably worried, as if they have been sentenced to death by a judge. However, with the speed of medical progress, which is almost a thousand miles a day, what was once seen as difficult to fundamentally treat with old leukorrhea now also has a method to fundamentally treat it. Therefore, it is not enough to fear leukorrhea, but what should be feared is that patients have no determination to fundamentally cure gonorrhea, often changing their minds, so it becomes more and more severe. If a reasonable and thorough cure can be made, there is no one who will not heal quickly. For example, arthritis, the most difficult symptom to treat in gonorrhea, according to my 20 years of research, is not as difficult to treat as generally imagined, and I also use the latest scientific methods for fundamental treatment. Because the range of escape of gonorrhea bacteria in this disease is so large, local therapy cannot fundamentally solve it. Therefore, only with the gonorrhea holy medicine "Ke Lin Nong" can it be most ideally solved. Because "Ke Lin Nong" has the effect of stimulating the phagocytic killing of gonorrhea bacteria, this effect can circulate with the blood flow to various places, and wherever it encounters gonorrhea bacteria, it will be surrounded and eaten. All of these are the special characteristics of "Ke Lin Nong." I also use the latest German invention of static electricity therapy and X-ray electrotherapy in combination, which is more likely to have unexpected effects. It is often seen that gonorrhea-related prostatitis, cystitis, epididymitis, urethral stricture, and other intractable gonorrhea diseases that have been repeatedly treated without cure can be completely cured within five weeks by changing to the above-mentioned treatments. However, within this time limit, it is necessary to insist on continuous treatment and not be slack or lazy. If the effect is slightly seen and they are still unwilling to make a thorough cure, it will inevitably fall short.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Legal Problems of Counterfeiting Currency <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Chengxiu</p>
<p>(1) The Evolution of Punishability for Counterfeiting Currency</p>
<p>Since the Tang Dynasty, there have been laws punishing the counterfeiting of currency, as the right to mint coins rested with the state, and private minting and counterfeiting interfered with the state's minting rights. Therefore, penal codes throughout the dynasties all contained special provisions prescribing severe penalties.</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, special chapters have also been established for counterfeiting currency, but the basis for punishment has changed somewhat from the past. The compilation of all penal laws and regulations, since the Provisional New Criminal Law, has been based on the type of legal interest infringed upon, determining the order of the articles, beginning with crimes infringing upon state legal interests, followed by crimes infringing upon social legal interests, and ending with crimes infringing upon individual legal interests. From the Provisional Law to the current Criminal Law, the crime of counterfeiting currency has been regarded as a crime infringing upon social legal interests, coming after crimes infringing upon state legal interests. This is because currency is indispensable in modern economic life, and economic production takes the acquisition of currency as its goal. Therefore, currency is essentially a medium of economic life. From the perspective of national economy and transaction security, the meaning of legislation shifts with the position of the regulation.</p>
<p>From this perspective, is the punishment for counterfeiting currency ultimately to protect state legal interests or to protect social legal interests? This kind of legislative shift is truly worthy of our study. In my opinion, the punishability of a crime is not immutable. Due to social evolution, the shifting of trends, changes in the times, and alterations in the environment, we cannot blindly adhere to outdated sayings and stand still. At the same time, a criminal act does not necessarily infringe upon only one type of legal interest. For example, in the case of false accusation, according to the latest interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, it is considered to infringe upon state legal interests on one hand, and individual legal interests on the other. To understand the punishability of counterfeiting currency, we must first understand these two meanings.</p>
<p>Several years ago, although the greatest reason for punishing counterfeiting currency was to protect the national economy and transaction security, in recent times, we cannot but slightly differ from the old view. China is currently in the process of resisting aggression and building the nation. All manpower, material resources, and financial resources are necessary factors for resisting aggression and building the nation. On the active side, how to develop resources and enrich economic strength is certainly an important current issue. On the passive side, how to crack down on counterfeit currency and stabilize finance is also a matter that concerns national policy above and the people's livelihood below. Although we cannot deny that counterfeiting currency is related to the national economy and transaction security, we also cannot deny that counterfeiting currency is related to the entire financial system and the future of national construction. If this statement is not considered absurd, then the crime of counterfeiting currency at least infringes upon state legal interests on one hand and social legal interests on the other. It is reasonable to say that infringing upon state legal interests is more noteworthy than infringing upon social legal interests, and it is not just viewed solely from the perspective of minting rights.</p>
<p>(2) The Crime of Counterfeiting Currency in the Criminal Law</p>
<p>The crime of counterfeiting currency is stipulated in Chapter 12 of the current Criminal Law; the entire chapter consists of six articles. In terms of the types of acts: there are (1) counterfeiting, (2) altering, (3) reducing weight, (4) using, collecting, delivering counterfeited, altered, and reduced-weight currency, (5) manufacturing, delivering, and receiving various implements and raw materials for counterfeiting, altering, or reducing weight. In terms of the objects of protection, there are (1) currency, banknotes, and bank notes.</p>
<p>Our country has always adopted a silver standard system, with the silver dollar as the unit of currency. Counterfeiting silver coins should constitute the crime of counterfeiting currency under the Criminal Law, which is not a problem in itself. The problem that arises is that after silver coins were nationalized, there was considerable debate among scholars as to whether the act of counterfeiting or altering should still be punished according to the provisions of the Criminal Law. Some said that after silver coins were nationalized, they lost their circulation and, although they were currency, they were not common, lacking the special constituent elements stipulated by the Criminal Law. Others said that although legal tender was nationalized, it was only the ancestor of banknotes and that the policy of paper currency was not implemented, and hard currency was still allowed to circulate within the exchange period, so it could not be said that it had no circulation, and its punishability had not changed as a result. Interpretation No. 1582 of the Judicial Yuan in the 25th year of the Republic of China stated: "Silver coins with restricted use are still recognized as common currency under the Criminal Law during the exchange period." This seems to adopt a compromise view, as there is a great difference between the period within the exchange period and the period after the expiration of the exchange period.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some things that should be explained: after the implementation of the currency system reform order on November 3, 24th year of the Republic of China, it was expressly ordered that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications be legal tender. There is no doubt that legal tender is paper currency. Banknotes issued by banks other than these three are not legal tender in nature but are bank notes. However, the banknotes issued by the Farmers Bank of China were expressly designated as legal tender on February 22, 25th year of the Republic of China, and were used in the same way as the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. Therefore, Interpretation No. 1803 of the Judicial Yuan in the 27th year of the Republic of China also stated: "Since the banknotes of the Farmers Bank of China have been approved by the Ministry of Finance and used in the same way as legal tender, counterfeiting the banknotes of that bank constitutes counterfeiting paper currency." This must also be known.</p>
<p>(3) Special Criminal Law for Counterfeiting Currency</p>
<p>Although there are provisions for punishment of the crime of counterfeiting currency in the Criminal Law, there are still special laws and regulations that must be explained:</p>
<p>The types of acts constituting the crime of counterfeiting currency under the Criminal Law have already been mentioned above. Judging from its provisions, transporting silver coins abroad is not included in the list of punishments. According to the principle of legality of crime and punishment, it is certainly not possible to convict and punish. However, in the past, the United States attached great importance to its silver policy, and repeatedly raised the price of silver. When the price of silver abroad was higher than that in the country, unscrupulous people, driven by profit, often smuggled it abroad. Some were even more unscrupulous, colluding with ruffians and relying on special forces to seek their own private interests, which was extremely harmful to silver coins. Therefore, with the approval of the Executive Yuan upon proposal by the Ministry of Finance, those who secretly transported silver coins and similar items abroad, or went to places where the silver standard currency was not used, were all severely punished in accordance with the Law on Punishing Emergency Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, depending on the circumstances. After being approved by the 458th meeting of the Central Political Conference and sent to the National Government, on May 28, 24th year of the Republic of China, the National Government issued Instruction No. 38 (Secret) ordering the Judicial Yuan to separately instruct the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court to comply. This is one of the special criminal laws and regulations for the crime of counterfeiting currency after the implementation of the new Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Although the punishment for secretly transporting silver coins and similar items abroad according to the Law on Punishing Emergency Crimes Endangering the Republic of China was only a temporary expedient, strictly speaking, orders cannot change the law, and crimes and punishments are not allowed to be compared and cited by analogy. Therefore, the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Obstructing the National Currency on July 15, 24th year of the Republic of China. The full text consisted of seven articles, which were intended to meet the needs of the times and to supplement the deficiencies of the Criminal Law. The acts punishable included smuggling out of the country, as well as destroying and reducing weight. The objects of protection included silver coins, as well as the ingots of the Central Mint. In essence, it was nothing more than expanding and enriching the scope of application of the aforementioned National Government order to make it more complete.</p>
<p>The original duration of the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Obstructing the National Currency was set at two years (Article 6). Later, with the express order of the National Government, it was extended for two years from July 15, 26th year of the Republic of China. According to this calculation, it should expire on July 15th of this year. At the same time, the articles were slightly modified at the beginning of the extension. Specifically, it is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A special article was established to punish those who counterfeit or alter currency with the intention of using it, with a sentence of life imprisonment or imprisonment for not less than five years, and a fine of not more than 5,000 yuan may also be imposed. The same applies to those who collect counterfeited or altered currency with the intention of using it. This was not in the old law and was added in the new law. According to Interpretation No. 1769 of the Judicial Yuan in the 27th year of the Republic of China, "The counterfeited or altered currency mentioned in the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Obstructing the National Currency includes silver coins, nickel coins, and bank notes." The acts punishable and the objects of protection are actually the same as those stipulated in the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>(2) Private transportation and destruction were originally limited to silver coins and the ingots of the Central Mint. The new law also includes copper coins. At the time of the amendment of the new law, it was right after the July 7th Incident, and the War of Resistance against Japan had already begun. Although the economic value of copper coins was less than that of silver coins and nickel coins, copper was an important raw material for military industrial equipment and machinery. Destroying copper coins and privately transporting them abroad had a huge impact on the future of the military. Therefore, they were also subject to criminal sanctions, which was the same as the intention to prohibit the export of copper cash after the event. However, copper cash was not currency, nor was it subsidiary currency, so it could not be stipulated together here.</p>
<p>Comparing the articles of the new and old Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Obstructing the National Currency, although both are special laws for the crime of counterfeiting currency, the legislative intentions of the two are very different: the old law was purely a supplementary provision, while the new law also included aggravated provisions. Therefore, judging from the content of the articles and the time of the amendment, it can also be proved that the crime of counterfeiting currency is not only an infringement on social legal interests.</p>
<p>(4) Conclusion</p>
<p>In applying the law, there is a maximum principle, that is, a special law takes precedence over a general law and is applied. Since the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Obstructing the National Currency is a special law for the crime of counterfeiting currency under the Criminal Law, when there are such acts that are expressly stipulated by the Provisional Regulations, the Provisional Regulations should of course be applied. The old Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Obstructing the National Currency was only a supplementary provision. In terms of the nature of its laws and regulations, although it had the effect of taking precedence in application, because its content did not conflict with the crime of counterfeiting currency under the Criminal Law, in fact, the application of the various articles of the crime of counterfeiting currency under the Criminal Law was not excluded. It can be said that it had the name of precedence but not the reality of precedence. If the amended Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Obstructing the National Currency has aggravated provisions, then the effect of taking precedence in application is extremely important. Therefore, when there are such cases, the application of the various articles of the crime of counterfeiting currency under the Criminal Law should be excluded, and the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Obstructing the National Currency should be applied as a priority.</p>
<p>The promulgation of special laws is hardly a permanent code, but in reality, it either supplements the deficiencies of general laws or adapts to the needs of the times. In times of great hardship during the current period of resisting aggression and building the nation, if counterfeit currency is not severely punished, legal tender is not stabilized, and finance is not stabilized, it will be enough to affect the overall situation. This is why the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Obstructing the National Currency was amended and promulgated, and the period of implementation was extended, which was inevitable.</p>
<p>The implementation of the law, in addition to special laws of territoriality, should have uniformity. In the past, scholars have criticized the implementation of the Court Organization Law by region. Since the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Obstructing the National Currency is a special law concerning matters and is not subject to military law, all courts in the country should apply it uniformly. It seems that there are not many examples of the Shanghai courts applying this special law. I don't know what the reason is? I hope that there will be a way to improve it.</p>
<p>Research and Criticism</p>
<h3 id="e112">Mr. Wang Xiaowen's Comments on Bank Procedures for Registered Payment Orders <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Cha Renwei</p>
<p>Banks often refuse to pay for checks with registered payee names unless they are collected by the bank. Generally, people are accustomed to it being wrong, and no one has ever refuted it. Mr. Wang Xiaowen of this publication argued for correction, which is truly irrefutable. I have long harbored this suspicion, and now, because of Mr. Wang's argument, I would like to express my opinion to supplement it. I wonder if I am also seeking details in discussing matters and am considered a comrade by Mr. Wang?</p>
<p>Article 121 of the Bills of Exchange Law stipulates the matters that should be recorded on a check, and Clause 4 is "the name and business name of the payee." Although the second paragraph of the same article has the exception that "if the payee is not recorded, the holder is the payee," in principle, it is undoubtedly necessary to clearly record the name or business name of the payee. According to Article 8:</p>
<p>"If one of the matters that should be recorded on a bill of exchange as stipulated in this law is missing, the bill of exchange is invalid." If there is no such exception, it concerns the validity of the check. Therefore, in the legislative intent, it is undoubtedly necessary to record the payee's name as a necessary condition. If the drawer issues a check in accordance with the Bills of Exchange Law, the registered payee is inevitable. Then, all checks will have to be collected by the bank, which is impossible.</p>
<p>Is this action by the banking industry to avoid responsibility? Then, according to Article 138 of the Bills of Exchange Law, the result of applying Article 68 of the same law mutatis mutandis already clearly has "the holder is not responsible for identification." Why worry too much? Is it to protect the interests of the drawer or the payee? Then, Article 134 of the Bills of Exchange Law already has provisions for ordinary crossed checks (drawing two parallel lines) and special crossed checks (parallel lines containing the business name of a bank). The drawer or the payee is not worried about having no preventative measures. Now, checks with registered payees must also be collected by the bank. This is not only indistinguishable from crossed checks, but also makes it inconvenient for the payee if they have no bank account. I sincerely hope that the banking industry will correct this as soon as possible to facilitate the circulation of checks.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Deposit Method Should Be Simple and Convenient <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhongluo</p>
<p>Since the Deposit Law was promulgated and implemented on January 7, 26th year of the Republic of China, it has been widely applied in this city to cases where landlords refuse to accept rent due to rental relationships. The oppressed tenants have benefited greatly. However, based on actual circumstances, the court seems to have failed to recognize the legislative intent for deposit cases, and has involved extra-legal trivialities. Examples are described as follows:</p>
<p>Tenant A, because the landlord refused to accept the rent, was verbally persuaded and unresolved. Fearing that the landlord would sue for eviction on the grounds of rent arrears, he deposited the rent payable in the bank in the name of "rent for a certain household" in accordance with the general custom before the Deposit Law was promulgated. Later, he heard that he must deposit with the court in accordance with the Deposit Law to have the effect of payment. He then obtained a deposit form and deposit notice from the court and filled it out in accordance with the formula, but the court did not immediately recognize that the deposit should be accepted in accordance with the Deposit Law, and ordered him to wait for written notice. Several days later, he received a notification letter in a carved format, which stated: "The statement in the deposit form that the landlord refused to accept the rent is not true. A letter is hereby issued to request the depositor to provide another statement explaining the reason and submit relevant documents for verification." A was not familiar with litigation and did not know how to write a statement "explaining the reason," and felt that it was difficult to obtain "documents of refusal to accept rent." He had no choice but to hire a lawyer to handle it. After submitting the statement, he received another standard notice, ordering him to bring the amount to be deposited to the court for deposit on a certain day at a certain time. On the due date, he went as scheduled, but the court only issued another certificate, instructing him to pay the money to the Central Trust Bureau to obtain evidence. He then returned to the court with the receipt from the Trust Bureau to exchange for a deposit certificate stating that the deposit had been received. From the date of application for deposit to the completion of the deposit procedure, it took more than two weeks. The cost of receiving two notification letters and one statement was an additional expense, not to mention the remuneration for hiring a lawyer to write the statement and the labor costs for A to go to the court and the Central Trust Bureau. Asking about the object of deposit, it was only more than ten yuan of rent. The triviality and inconvenience made the depositor feel that it was better to do less than more after spending time and money.</p>
<p>The above case was seen in the local court of District 1 in this city and was personally witnessed by the author. Although there is no knowledge of the same situation in other courts, judging from the fact that the two notifications issued by the court were in a carved format, the triviality of the method was not caused by the special nature of A's deposit case, and it has formed a necessary procedure for such cases, which can be asserted. Deposit is a non-contentious matter. The reason for the deposit is not the responsibility of the depositor to provide evidence and explanation. Now, they are ordered to provide a statement for litigation, explain the reason, and attach documents, which is unfounded according to the Deposit Law and its implementation rules. After accepting the statement and documents and recognizing that the deposit should be accepted, a certificate is not immediately sent to the depositor, but the depositor is required to go to the designated place to deliver the deposit, and must go to the court at the specified time to receive the certificate and then follow the instructions. The procedures are repeated again and again, which is not a way to facilitate the people. The judicial authorities should pay attention to how to make the implementation of the deposit method simple and convenient and improve it!</p>

<h3 id="e114">Litigation Petition to Trial Reconciliation Exempt from Litigation Costs <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>When parties are in litigation and petition for trial reconciliation, they should be exempt from litigation costs. After the Ministry of Justice requested instructions from the Judicial Yuan, it is now known that the Judicial Yuan issued Instruction No. 1538 on November 25, 27th year of the Republic of China to the Ministry of Justice, stating that when parties are in litigation and petition for trial reconciliation, it is a procedure after the lawsuit and is not listed in Articles 18 and 19 of the Provisional Rules on Litigation Costs. Therefore, fees should be exempted (rest omitted).</p>
<p>Summary of Judgments</p>
<p>In addition to declaring to other partners in accordance with the law, a partner's withdrawal from the partnership must also give third parties the opportunity to know of their withdrawal (such as by publishing a statement in the newspaper, etc.) in order to be able to assert it against third parties. (Hu Shang Zi No. 93, 27th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>Article 10 of the Bills of Exchange Law only restricts the debtor of the bill of exchange from asserting the reasons for defense existing between themselves and the issuer or the previous holder against the holder. However, with respect to the issuer, it is not impermissible to assert the reasons for direct defense against the payee. (Hu Shang Zi No. 97, 27th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(Question) A (a doctor) leases a piece of vacant land to B (a businessman) to build a house, stipulating an annual rent of 600 yuan. At that time, B paid a security deposit of 600 yuan in national currency cash. The first year's rent of 600 yuan was paid by check drawn from the bank, which A had to discount for 30 yuan. After repeated negotiations, B insisted on using a check, saying that it was customary for Shanghai merchants, and refused to pay in cash. Can A sue in court? (Wan)</p>
<p>(Answer) The judgments of the Shanghai Special Zone Courts have consistently recognized that bank drafts are not universally used with legal tender, so A has a reason. However, from the perspective of stabilizing finance, there is room for discussion. It is heard that this issue has recently been submitted by a certain agency to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. (Same)</p>
<p>(A) (1) Because B (female) ran away, and it has been several months since then, and youth only comes once in life, A (male) wants to marry another woman. Is this legal? (2) Can A (male) publish a notice in the newspaper? Set a time limit for resolution. (3) If B ignores the notice and marries someone else, can A claim compensation for marriage expenses and all other losses? (Lu Yaoyong)</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) It is not permissible to marry another woman without a legal divorce. (2) It is permissible to publish a notice in good faith, but publishing a notice is not enough to resolve the matter. (3) If B marries someone else, then A can file a lawsuit in accordance with the circumstances and seek compensation for considerable damages. (Same)</p>

<p>A common saying goes, "Officials judge ten reasons, and one reason is right." Are there really that many reasons? There should only be one reason. If there is only one reason, then the same thing should not have several different judgments. If there are different judgments, the reasons for the different judgments must be explained clearly, so that there will be no doubt or confusion.</p>

<p>Cheng Shaode: What kind of price balancing? It should start from the reasons for price increases, and distinguish between two major categories: those that can be balanced and those that cannot. Reasons such as damaged production equipment, disrupted wartime transportation, and increased exorbitant taxes cannot be resolved in the shortest period of time. The major responsibility for balancing prices in Shanghai rests with the private sector. If we do not find ways to eliminate the causes of high prices that can be eliminated, that is unforgivable. For example, speculation and manipulation, or people's unwarranted anxieties about the future of prices, these causes can be eliminated, and the press should at least fulfill its responsibility to advocate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, categorizing controls into luxury goods and daily necessities, although partly justified, is not entirely reasonable. Because price increases are interconnected in a cause-and-effect relationship. While we should acknowledge that balancing the prices of daily necessities is a priority, we must understand the relationship between prices and the overall social economy. Price fluctuations cause instability in the social economy. Therefore, balancing current prices is not only necessary for the present, but also for the future. Please recall the economic cycles that constantly occur in social and economic changes, the fluctuations of prosperity and decline, all led by price fluctuations. After prices soar to their peak, the result is competitive production, or increased supply from other sources, until supply increases sharply. Then prices fall back, and because production equipment has increased sharply, there is no overproduction. At that time, there will inevitably be competitive price cuts and dumping, leading to successive bankruptcies in various industries. In wartime China, we fear that production will not increase, and due to objective environmental constraints, there is no possibility of immediately increasing production in the short term. However, due to sharp price increases, there is often the possibility of increasing supply from other sources. So, is there a risk that the final result of the current high prices will be oversupply? At the same time, there is a risk of the disintegration of the national economy in the future. The recent increase in restaurants within the settlements, and the widespread development of building houses on leased land, etc., increase the possibility of economic panic in Shanghai after the war is over. As for the increased burden on the people due to rising prices, which is enough to cause various social unrest, that should be resolved. National thrift in consumption can reduce demand, but there is a certain limit to thrift in daily necessities. Obviously, consumption thrift cannot suppress the momentum of rising prices. In the case of extreme bankruptcy of national purchasing power, there are infinite hidden worries for the entire social economy.</p>
<p>Of course, controlling prices is not easy, but it is not impossible. We should start with the possible aspects and gradually find ways to solve them. We should not worry too much about various matters. If we worry too much, we cannot take a single step. Please think again, before we implemented the legal tender policy in our country, who would have believed that we could implement such an ideal monetary system? But we finally completed the great task with perseverance. Now, to balance prices, the question is whether we have the perseverance.</p>
<p>Of course, we must also consider the facts: external causes, such as the harsh levies and extortion of the Japanese puppets and the Japanese puppets' control of goods. The recent soaring price of soybean oil from the north is one example. This is something that needs to be resolved militarily. We are powerless. The decline of the exchange rate in the black market is too complex, although we cannot ignore it, it is unlikely to fall again, so its effect on stimulating price increases is already a fait accompli. Our goal is to stabilize prices, not to devalue prices, so the effect of the stable black market exchange rate on price controls can be said to no longer have a controlling effect. We want to stabilize current prices so that they will not rise further. No matter how we say it, we will not cause any harm to any party. However, speculators and manipulators can no longer hope for more unjust income. But even at the current price level, they can enjoy a large amount of unjust income. To stabilize current prices, in addition to public opinion support, the most important thing is the practical cooperation and mutual restraint of all sectors. It is hoped that various industries in Shanghai will automatically organize price-balancing groups. This is better than having no organization and allowing prices to compete and rise under speculation.</p>
<p>Pan Yangyao: Based on my two visits to various parts of the Southwest, I believe that if the government wants to balance domestic prices today, first, it should encourage the establishment of more factories in the interior, especially daily necessities industries. Second, it should order local governments to reduce or exempt all taxes on domestic goods and provide merchants with various transportation conveniences. At the same time, it should encourage the export of local products and adopt a policy of bartering, so that supply and demand in the interior can be adjusted. Most importantly, the private sector should cooperate in autonomous control. I feel that financial institutions can serve as the pivot of private autonomy. Currently, they can help the government and the private sector handle the following matters:</p>
<p>(1) More warehouses should be established so that the bank can use purchasing or mortgage methods to store local products and imported local goods in warehouses, and sell them at fair prices at any time to adjust surpluses and deficits, leaving room for flexibility in the supply and demand of goods. The purpose is to stabilize prices, not to make profits. Therefore, losses are inevitable. The government should provide appropriate compensation for such losses. Such fair-price sales must continue to be effective. If it is done temporarily, it will facilitate speculators.</p>
<p>(2) Exchange and insurance should be handled to reduce the long-term financial burden on manufacturers and eliminate various unexpected risks. The Central Trust Bureau is already responsible for handling cargo insurance business, but the scale is not large enough to popularize it among the general industrial and commercial circles. As for exchange, if the banking industry decides to handle exchange on the same standard, it can have a great effect on fair pricing. For example, agree to accept exchange for commodities with rising prices at a standardized standard price, otherwise, unanimously refuse to accept it. If the price of the commodity is falling, the exchange should also be handled at the standard price and not underestimate its value. In this way, prices that are too high can be lowered, and prices that are too low can be raised.</p>
<p>(3) Help the transportation industry or various industries to concurrently operate transportation agencies to facilitate freight transportation and reduce the elements that constitute high prices. It is heard that various industries in the Southwest have provided loans to transportation agencies to add vehicles and manufacture wartime rubber cars, which is commendable.</p>
<p>(4) Recruit specialized talents to go to the interior to help factories and small private industries, and guide various new production methods. This will not only improve the quality of products but also increase their quantity.</p>
<p>These methods focus on the root cause. As for emergency measures, it is best to invite various private groups to unite and organize a fair price committee. Everyone should swear not to freely raise or lower prices. First, jointly determine a standard for the highest and lowest prices, and each industry can freely fluctuate within this price range, and use joint supervision methods to prohibit anyone from exceeding this limit. If anyone exceeds the limit, they will be jointly sanctioned. When more than half of the industry requests to revise the standard price, a meeting will be held to jointly discuss a revised new standard price for common compliance. At the same time, all sectors of society should also be responsible for monitoring at any time and restrict trade associations. The press should cooperate to publicly announce the illegal businesses after a thorough investigation. The court should also recognize it as legal. This method may give hope for price stability. What do you experts think? Please correct me.</p>
<p>Shi Huikang: The current price situation in Shanghai is indeed a very serious problem, but the prices in the interior (especially the prices of industrial products) are in some places even one or even several times more expensive than in Shanghai. Therefore, the severity of the price situation in the interior may not be less than that of Shanghai. The main reason for the high prices in Shanghai is the contraction of foreign exchange and the shortage of production. However, the sudden increase in the population of Shanghai after the war has further formed a relative shortage of supplies in Shanghai, which is also a factor contributing to the soaring prices in Shanghai. The result of the soaring prices in Shanghai is that the citizens of Shanghai are subjected to severe pressure in their lives, which of course has an indirect impact on the war economy. However, the soaring prices in the interior are due to the shortage of production. The shortage of production in the interior will, of course, also subject the people in the interior to pressure in their lives, but the impact on the war of resistance is direct. Therefore, I feel that the nature of the price problem in the interior is actually more serious than in Shanghai, and it urgently needs to be rescued.</p>
<p>But what methods can we use to prevent prices from rising in Shanghai and at the same time increase production in the interior and stabilize prices in the interior? I think the most effective way is to promote the relocation of Shanghai industries to the interior. I believe that the abnormal development of Shanghai's industry is not only not a blessing for the citizens of Shanghai, but also not a good phenomenon from the standpoint of the war of resistance economy. Because (1) the result of the development of Shanghai's industry will inevitably lead to a supply and demand relationship in the market with the nearby occupied areas. Shanghai's industrial need for raw materials in the occupied areas will promote the purchasing power of the occupied areas and promote the economic development of the occupied areas. The economic development of the occupied areas will, of course, facilitate the rule of the Japanese puppets. At the same time, if Shanghai's industry supplies biological products to the occupied areas, it will not only supply materials to the enemy, but will also reduce the supply of materials to Shanghai and the interior. In this way, the increase in industrial production in Shanghai will not only fail to balance prices in Shanghai, but will also promote the soaring prices in the interior. (2) As a result of the development of Shanghai's industry, a large number of people are absorbed into it invisibly. The concentration of the population in Shanghai increases the consumption of materials in Shanghai, thereby promoting the soaring prices in Shanghai. The development of Shanghai's industry is not only not helpful to the price situation in Shanghai, but also objectively unfavorable to the war of resistance economy. Therefore, I advocate that Shanghai's industry should be relocated to the interior. Because after Shanghai's industry is relocated to the interior, not only (1) the supply of materials in the interior can be enriched, prices can be stabilized, and the war of resistance economic structure can be strengthened; but also (2) after Shanghai's industry is relocated to the interior, the population based on production relations can be dispersed to the interior, and the dispersion of the population in Shanghai can, of course, reduce the demand for materials in Shanghai, and relatively suppress prices in Shanghai. I think this method is worth actively promoting, but there are certainly many difficulties in implementing it. However, we hope that the industrialists in Shanghai will deeply understand the current crisis of the Chinese nation, and for the future of the Chinese nation and the personal interests of Chinese national capitalists, they should automatically implement this meaningful work. We especially hope that the financial circles in Shanghai will take the lead in transferring the funds operating in Shanghai's industry and commerce to the interior.</p>
<p>Zhang Wuyun: According to past experience, bank lending often increases when prices rise, and decreases when prices fall. However, under the current situation of rising prices, the loans made by various banks do not seem to be in great need of the help of the banking industry. Moreover, for the sake of ensuring the safety of its own lending, the banking industry, in view of the current situation and the pressure to suppress prices, seems unlikely to be effective. The current rise in prices is not due to the banking industry releasing a large amount of chips, but due to the imbalance of supply and demand itself, which is very different from the usual situation.</p>
<p>Sun Liyu: Some people think that credit has contracted during the period of high prices in Shanghai, so the reason for high prices is not in currency. However, I think that currency inflation is relative. If the amount of currency remains the same, but the goods purchased are reduced, then the currency will be relatively excessive, and the phenomenon of high prices will occur. Now Shanghai banks are cautious in their business, and there are not many exchange. This is indeed a phenomenon of credit contraction, but in fact, the reduction in the production of domestic goods is even more than the contraction of credit, so prices are forced to rise. Moreover, the number of commodities settled in foreign exchange is gradually increasing. For example, domestic goods from North China, which could have been traded in legal tender, now have to be settled in pseudo-currency at a price of one shilling and two pence. How can the overall price not rise step by step.</p>
<p>Nie Guangdi: Prices will not rise indefinitely, because the future of the war is promising and people's hearts are gradually stabilizing. In the past, the wind of hoarding was due to the unfamiliarity with wartime life and the many storms of legal tender. Now the situation of the war of resistance is becoming more and more promising, reflecting the psychology of the people, who feel that there is a way to do everything, and the belief in legal tender is easier to improve, and the wind of hoarding can gradually be reduced. In times of national crisis, everyone should work together. Merchants certainly hope that they can automatically reduce profits to help the people in need, and consumers should also practice thrift and never waste again. It is best not to use imported goods, otherwise, we should try to use domestic goods instead. If everyone uses less foreign goods, we can add a sum of foreign exchange, and invisibly increase the power of our country's war of resistance. This point seems worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Zhang Wuyun: In the long run, prices and exchange rates will certainly be related, which is undeniable. However, in the past twenty months, the relationship can be said to be not very close. It is better to say that prices follow supply and demand than prices follow exchange rates. This is because people still have a strong belief in legal tender, and the sale and purchase of bulk commodities still focus on supply and demand, not exclusively on currency value, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. Therefore, we can know that the future of prices is greatly related to the war. If the future of the war is smooth, then after production and needs are gradually coordinated, prices will not rise excessively. However, if the war is not smooth, and more important factors of supply and demand imbalance add fuel to the fire, even control will not be easy to achieve. Therefore, the issue of prices is indeed a part of the major issue of the war.</p>
<p>Cheng Shaode: Too much consideration will lead to nothing. Scholars' gatherings should express more views from the opposite side, so that the countermeasures in the plan can have fewer drawbacks. However, we should also think of more ways on the positive side. Otherwise, it will become a concentration of pessimism, not a concentration of constructive opinions.</p>
<p>It is indeed impossible to not allow the industrial and commercial circles to make money. However, advising the industrial and commercial circles to make less money will not be completely ineffective, because this is a moral responsibility. Who can say that the people in the industrial and commercial circles are all immoral? Moreover, in fact, there are also many moral people in the industrial and commercial circles.</p>
<p>Now the best way is for the trade association to decide on some standard prices on the one hand, and for public opinion to urge various industries to comply on the other hand. Then, even if there is a high price, there will be some restrictions, and it will not increase infinitely. Therefore, I always advocate that the press should take the lead. If the trade association can respond, then the press has at least completed the first step of work. Therefore, we should actively advocate and ask various industries to organize a price-balancing committee to restrict unreasonable increases. Mutual consideration will have some effect on prices.</p>
<p>Nie Guangdi: Even if the trade association has a standard price decision and even notifies members, but without political power as the background, it is still the same as a formal document and is useless.</p>
<p>Cheng Shaode: Yes, but the power of public opinion should not be underestimated. If everyone thinks it cannot be done, they will give up the responsibility of advocating, then there is no way. If everyone does not care whether it can be done or not, and can continue to advocate, and constantly conduct constructive research and make constructive suggestions in the advocacy, then there will always be the possibility of an effect or implementation.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: Price controls in Europe and the United States include the highest and lowest price method, the use grade method, the quantitative system, reducing intermediaries, and bonuses, etc. However, Europe and the United States are industrialized countries, and we are an agricultural country. The implementation techniques cannot be generalized. We must prescribe the right medicine according to the reasons for the soaring prices. I have previously proposed three standards for analyzing prices, namely, according to location, according to time, and according to commodity. According to this standard: according to location, we will set it as Shanghai, and according to time, we will set it as now. The third type, according to commodity, is generally divided into military needs and civilian needs in various countries. Shanghai has now become a consumer port, not a military production area. Therefore, what we want to discuss are civilian needs. It is also impossible to control civilian prices in general. Luxury goods can be ignored. We should choose the best to control among the items that are most closely related to the clothing, food, and shelter of ordinary people, in order to adjust the people's lives and seek economic and social stability. Managing prices should be done by both the government and the people. However, because Shanghai's situation is special, and the government's tool is only the law, and the people automatically handle it, they are not only familiar with the inside situation, but also reduce public resentment and achieve results easily. Therefore, I advocate focusing on promoting private autonomous price control. The control methods are nothing more than (1) expanding public opinion and organizing groups; (2) researching substitutes; (3) practicing thrift; (4) increasing production. Practicing thrift can reduce expenditure, and increasing production can increase income. In Shanghai, we cannot increase production as we wish to increase income, but reducing expenditure is within our power, so I think the thrift movement is more important. Regarding these various methods, Mr. Wang Ertong has already explained just now, so I don't need to repeat them. However, I feel that there is one more thing to add, that is, to intensify the promotion of domestic goods: this is not because only imported goods are rising in price now and domestic goods are not rising in price, but because using domestic goods has at least two other advantages. First, domestic goods are always cheaper than foreign goods. Second, using domestic goods helps the foreign exchange fund. As for the time of implementing price control, there are certainly many technical difficulties, and we must break through the difficulties and proceed separately. Examples of this include: 1. The problem of statistical figures and accounts. There are precise and detailed statistics on various commodity prices in various countries at any time; merchants' purchases and sales also have reliable accounting bookkeeping documents for verification. In our country, there is a lack of accurate statistical data on commodity prices at ordinary times, and merchants' accounts are chaotic and difficult to verify; this should be paid attention to; 2. The problem of commodity classification. Foreign commodities can meet certain standards, so classification is easy. Our country is complex, so classification is difficult. 3. In terms of methods, if the exorbitant profit tax can be passed on, considering the people's aspect, it is still appropriate to use the highest price method. I don't think anyone will object. Therefore, what we want to study is not the principle problem but the technical problem. For example, how to obtain accurate commodity price statistical figures, how to set the standard for rising and falling and control, how to investigate when someone manipulates prices, how to classify commodities, what method to use to control, and how to break through the difficulties of Shanghai's special environment. All of these belong to technical problems, and technical problems are the key to the success or failure of price control. We must grasp the core of each problem by category, and the problem can be solved.</p>
<p>Nie Guangdi: Public opinion supervision can exert some power on hoarding, speculation, manipulation, and profiteering. If we want to promote the self-government control of various industries, we must rely on public opinion to promote it.</p>
<p>Li Quanshi: If the people can automatically practice thrift in consumption, speculators and manipulators will have no place to use their skills.</p>
<p>Sun Liyu: Regarding the issue of self-government control of prices, I decide that it should be mentioned in the same breath as the government's control policy. The self-government control of various trade associations is the easiest method to implement in theory, and looking around at the control policies of various countries, they all believe that this is the most important and most practical method. However, the purpose of industrialists and merchants in running industry and commerce is to pursue profits. To ask them to lower prices and reduce profits is indeed no different from "seeking skin with a tiger." Just look at the fact that many merchants are making "national crisis money" now, and you can get clear evidence. The current trade associations are not only unable to prevent prices from rising, but are instead adding fuel to the fire to raise prices. However, we will never deny the function of trade associations in control because of this. If used well, this is indeed a very good means, just like "fire," which can be used for warming and cooking, but can also start a prairie fire. Now Japan's price control is very strict. The country stipulates the prices of many small commodities and does not allow them to rise beyond the limit. At the same time, it also investigates the goods in stock and restricts merchants from hoarding. These methods are all implemented by various trade associations, which are easy to handle and better than setting up other institutions by the country. Their trade associations do contribute a lot to price control under the country's control. At the same time, the Shanghai Rice Industry Association also played a great control effect under the management of the Municipal Council. Therefore, as long as the political power organs can make good use of trade associations, it is indeed a very good tool; on the contrary, if the power is not used and trade associations are allowed to control themselves, it will instead become a monopoly organization for profiteering merchants. Now the power of the Chinese government can no longer reach Shanghai, and the only recognized power organ in Shanghai is the concession authorities. Therefore, if we want to control prices, we must ask the Municipal Council to launch its power. Even if the Municipal Council does not consider the future of China's war of resistance, this measure is also necessary for the sake of maintaining the security of the concession.</p>
<p>However, this method also relies on the creation of public opinion. With the power of public opinion, promote the progress of all parties. Now in the Shanghai area, the power of the government cannot be completely reached, and the method of private self-government control is especially hoped that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce can take on this important task. As for the steps to be taken, it should start with investigation, and first distinguish the types of commodities to determine the urgency of the fair price policy. This is what I hope the Chamber of Commerce and trade association can carry out automatically. When necessary, the government must also order the Chamber of Commerce to be responsible for handling it.</p>
<p>Wang Yutong: There are many examples of price control in various countries, especially during foreign wars, and all of them start with price control. For example, A. During the European War, the United States collected and calculated the materials needed for the navy, army, air force, and related military service, so as to ensure that all materials were allocated for military use first, and the surplus could be allocated to private individuals. The prices allocated to private individuals were also stipulated by the government and could not be raised arbitrarily. Its highest control agency was the Wartime Industries Bureau, and even general capital lending had to be reviewed by the Industries Bureau first. B. Among the countries of the world, Germany has the most experience in price control. In the past twenty-five years, Germany has gone through four stages of price control: (1) the Great War period, (2) 1931-32, (3) 1934-35, (4) 1936. The first and last periods are absolutely different from the middle two periods. The former used the price control system to replace the law of supply and demand, while the purpose of the latter control was to restore the free flow of commerce with the power of the government and allow prices to suit the reduced purchasing power. C. Italy's price control is the most thorough among the countries. In 1936, the Italian government implemented a scientific price control with the Central Price Committee as the highest agency, under which there were joint conferences of provinces and industries, in which all relevant stakeholders were farmers, manufacturers, workers, transporters, wholesalers, and retailers. All of them had representatives present, and discussed with representatives of various government departments and the Fascist Party to obtain thorough and priority reports on all the factors that make up prices. Each commodity, from the countryside or mine to the factory, then to the warehouse, cold storage, market, and finally to the consumer's hand, can be deeply researched layer by layer. D. After the war of aggression against China, Japan adopted an automatic price control policy for domestic prices. However, as the war expanded, domestic prices rose endlessly, and this policy still failed. Therefore, in April 1938, it was decided to implement a forced rule system. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry organized price committees in the central and local governments to be responsible for formulating price affairs. The comprehensive Japanese price control policies are as follows: (1) planning to conserve consumption, in order to adjust the supply and demand of goods, and using both allocation control and price control methods to curb the rising trend of prices; (2) increasing production plans; (3) rewards for substitutes; (4) rewards for savings. The above items are either passive or active, and vary according to national conditions.</p>
<p>Liu Xingchen: Narrowing down the problem, for example, only talking about the rent problem, Shanghai's house prices are now obviously under the control of landlords. If the Municipal Council comes out and stipulates a fair rent standard, it will also be helpful to people's livelihood. Secondly, the organization of a union by subtenants to confront the head tenant is also a way.</p>
<p>Wu Guanzhou: Allow me to also report some things about rent. This is not only closely related to the lives of us staff, but also closely related to the lives of the general citizens of Shanghai. We have been exploited by second-hand landlords to the extreme, but there is no room for appeal. Mr. Liu just raised this question, so I boldly reported what I know. If you gentlemen uphold some justice, the power will certainly be much greater. The exploitation of subtenants by second-hand landlords is meticulous. They are not afraid of the head tenant raising the rent, and they even welcome the head tenant raising the rent, because if the head tenant raises the rent by 10%, then he can raise the rent by 10% to all subtenants. If there are two second-hand landlords, he will have 20% income. Similarly, when the concession authorities raise the property tax, raise the electricity bill, and raise the water bill, they all take the opportunity to extort.</p>
<p>Wei Youpei: It is said that when the court handles rent problems, it is always more considerate of the tenants. If a lawsuit occurs between the owner and the second-hand landlord, the judge can always take into account the position of the second-hand landlord. If a lawsuit occurs between the second-hand landlord and the subtenant, the court can always show more sympathy for the difficulties of the subtenant. However, the fundamental problem of rent in Shanghai is that the population is greater than the distribution of houses, so there is simply no solution.</p>

<h3 id="e118">The Limit of Demands <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Demands know no bounds.</p>
<p>Considering international events: Germany demanded the annexation of the Sudetenland region, and after being satisfied, demanded the partition of the entire Czech Republic. Without being stopped, after they achieved their wish, they then demanded the return of Memel. After being satisfied, they are now demanding the occupation of Danzig. Assuming Danzig is indeed given to them, what will happen then? Obviously, their demands will be numerous: demands for the return of colonies; demands for the return of reparations after the European War; demands… will emerge endlessly and continuously. Demands know no bounds.</p>
<p>Considering local events: A certain party demands a certain right, and after being satisfied, demands a certain prohibition. After partially complying, they then raise other demands. By compromising and seeking complete satisfaction, one cannot obtain understanding. The demands made even reach fundamental issues, concerning the entire future of the locality. Naturally, such demands will also expand and even exceed the scope of local events. Demands know no bounds.</p>
<p>However, is there really no solution to the world's affairs? It is not necessarily the case; there are always solutions. In other words, demands ultimately have limits.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. President's "inquiry" was worded politely and not threatening, and although the inquired party expressed contempt for the inquiry and ridiculed it thoroughly, the inquired party's fierce flames were dampened and they dared not act recklessly again. Similarly, the British government's enactment of conscription also prevented the demanding party from acting rashly, using the threat of resorting to arms as intimidation. Demands do not stop automatically, so they are made to stop. Demands have limits.</p>
<p>Suppose that when Germany demanded the annexation of the Sudetenland, the United States had issued such an "inquiry," saying a word, and Britain had such determination to use conscription as a backing for the weak, would Germany still have had all the subsequent demands? This is of course difficult to say. However, even if demands were still inevitable later, they would certainly not have reached the current situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that when a demand comes, one must not simply look at the demand itself, thinking that it can be agreed to and agreeing to it, so that the demanding party's appetite grows larger and larger. One must always consider the consequences of agreeing to this demand. And even when agreeing to one or two demands, one must constantly find ways to ensure that there are no further demands. Otherwise, demands will indeed know no bounds.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Gate of Struggle <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qing</p>
<p>At dawn, a few pale yellow morning stars sparsely hung in the sky, and the earth was shrouded in a thin mist. All around were only vague outlines of houses and streets. People were still wrapped in warm and pleasant dreams, waiting for a huge sound to awaken them.</p>
<p>The steady and determined footsteps of a young man rippled in the air. His face was submerged in the mist. He stopped in front of an open gate, looking at the wall. On both sides of the wall were two large red characters: "Struggle." Without hesitation, he wanted to step through the gate, but suddenly an old man with white hair and beard appeared from inside the gate, blocking him with his hand. Clear words came from the old man's mouth.</p>
<p>"Hey! What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"I want to enter this Gate of Struggle." The voice was as calm and steady as a waveless sea, speaking each word distinctly, "To struggle!"</p>
<p>The old man's face was very solemn: "Every day, I don't know how many people come here, but many of them go in and then come back out..."</p>
<p>"No, I will not come back out, unless I get what I demand. I have come here with the greatest determination."</p>
<p>"What do you want? Is it like them, wanting to gain survival and liberation in this 'struggle'?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is what I want. We have been bullied enough by others. We need to be fiercely awakened, to retaliate with tooth and nail. They didn't acknowledge us before, but now there is new life. We are rising up to struggle."</p>
<p>"Struggle, you must know that this is not something to be said lightly. Peek inside and see. Here, ah! Here! There is only death here." As he spoke, the old man stepped aside.</p>
<p>He peered inside. The ground inside was covered with bright red and dark purple blood. Piles of white bones were scattered here and there. Even more, cries of agony, curses, and angry voices blended together, creating a very gloomy and frightening atmosphere. But he was not afraid. No, he had already seen the light beyond this. He said even more firmly and steadily:</p>
<p>"Death and bloodshed do not chill my heart. To seek survival and liberation, death and bloodshed are necessary. I have long since cast that aside."</p>
<p>"Death and bloodshed do not concern you, but turn around and look. Your mother, younger siblings, and lover are anxiously waiting for you to return home, to give you comfort and love. And those intoxicating music and rich wine are also waiting for you to enjoy them. All of this is so lovely. Why not return there?" "Enjoyment? Now is not the time for enjoyment. Let those things rot. As for my loved ones, I think they will soon come to this Gate of Struggle as well, for their survival and liberation. Even more, for love, let all love grow within this Gate of Struggle."</p>
<p>Hearing these passionate words, a rare radiance flashed on the old man's face. Smiling, he said tremblingly and excitedly:</p>
<p>"Young man, come in! I wish you victory, and I forever bless you. May you succeed."</p>
<p>The young man was moved and stepped into the Gate of Struggle. Looking inside, suddenly all the gloomy and horrible things vanished. Everywhere were blood-red flowers blooming, seemingly nodding and smiling at him.</p>

<p>In small rivers and ditches, the filthy, stagnant water is the most disgusting thing on earth. Only bacteria jump there, and mosquito larvae sing. Green duckweed and green reeds will never keep them company.</p>
<p>In lakes and rivers, the quiet flowing water and murmuring sounds seem to have little vitality. The space is too lonely and too somber! Staying there gives rise to endless laziness.</p>
<p>The most worthy of praise are the waves in rivers and seas. They are so vast, and the sound of the crashing waves on the shore is even more magnificent!</p>
<p>This symbolizes life, beautiful life, which should have the perseverance of waves. It will not be so quiet, without a sound, forgotten by the world—</p>
<p>In the sea woven by waves, the aquatic creatures that live in it all have strong strength!</p>
<p>Waves roll on the water surface, and the beautiful spray will not be stopped by any force.</p>
<p>Waves are a rare miracle in the world!</p>

<p>— Yi Xing</p>
<p>Even lambs being dragged to their deaths utter bleating sounds. Even oxen being led to the slaughterhouse take stubborn steps. How can human beings, the most intelligent of all creatures, being slaughtered and massacred without any guilt, have no expression at all?</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been major bombings everywhere. How many innocent compatriots have had their heads severed and limbs torn apart, with flesh and blood flying everywhere— Even though we have not personally experienced it, who is not shocked and deeply hateful towards the rampaging invaders, wishing to devour them and be satisfied? However, we are on an isolated island. What can we do? We certainly cannot take direct action to retaliate, and we cannot cry, cannot scold, cannot express any anger in words or expressions. It seems that other than silence, it would be best to put on some smiles. We are worse than lambs, worse than oxen. It is simply shameful!</p>
<p>What should we do? Of course, we cannot express anything here. Small impatience ruins great plans. If we want to express ourselves, let us leave this place and go to the mainland!</p>
<p>I hope that everyone with blood and qi, and who is unencumbered and unattached, will go to the mainland. There, we can freely express our emotions and manifest them in the actions we are willing to take: to preserve our personal dignity! To preserve the national dignity of our country!

<h3 id="e123">Talking About Death <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Death originally has distinctions of being heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. What is meant by heavier than Mount Tai is nothing more than "sacrificing oneself for righteousness" and "giving up life for justice." Only by being able to die in this way will one's name be recorded in history, shine with the sun and moon, and live as long as heaven and earth. Although dead, one is still alive. This is why it is said to be heavier than Mount Tai.</p>
<p>However, achieving righteousness and taking justice seem to require a process. That is to say: only sacrificing oneself when one should sacrifice oneself can be called achieving righteousness; only giving up life when one should give up life can be called taking justice. If one rashly sacrifices oneself and gives up life, it is not necessarily possible to say that one has achieved the purpose of achieving righteousness and taking justice. Mencius has two stories that explain this matter, and I will first quote them below:</p>
<p>"When Zengzi lived in Wucheng, there were Yue bandits. Someone said, 'The bandits are coming. Why don't you leave?' Zengzi said, 'Do not house people in my room, damaging their firewood and timber.' When the bandits retreated, he said, 'Repair my walls and roof. I will return.' When the bandits retreated, Zengzi returned. His attendants said, 'Treating you so loyally and respectfully, you leave first when the bandits come, setting an example for the people. You return when the bandits retreat. This is almost unacceptable.' Shen Youxing said, 'This is not something you can understand. Formerly, Shen You had the misfortune of Chu, and seventy people followed him, but none were involved.' Zisi lived in Wei, and there were Qi bandits. Someone said, 'The bandits are coming. Why don't you leave?' Zisi said, 'If I leave, who will guard the ruler?' Mencius said, 'Zengzi and Zisi followed the same path. Zengzi was a teacher and father-figure. Zisi was a minister and insignificant. Zengzi and Zisi would both act in the same way if their positions were reversed.'"</p>
<p>The passage says that being a teacher is different from being a minister, so when bandits come, one can leave, and the other cannot. Because Zengzi was only a teacher, without any weapons, even if he sacrificed himself and gave up his life, it would not necessarily be considered achieving righteousness and taking justice. Zisi, as a high-ranking minister, should forget himself for the country. Even if he sacrificed himself and gave up his life, he would still be achieving righteousness and taking justice. Therefore, Mencius criticized them, believing that Zengzi and Zisi had the same path. If their environments were changed, both would act in the same way.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone will say: according to this, only ministers who sacrifice themselves and give up their lives can achieve righteousness and take justice. Even if common people sacrifice themselves and give up their lives, they have not achieved righteousness and taken justice. But this is not the case. Zhuge Liang said in his Later Edict on the Expedition, "Exerting myself to the utmost until death." Wen Tianxiang said in his Self-Eulogy, "Only by exhausting righteousness can benevolence be achieved." These two words, "exhaust," are really worth our attention. This word "exhaust" undoubtedly indicates to people an active meaning. We must actively strive for the country, and only after exerting our efforts to the fullest can we die. Before exhausting our efforts, we really do not need to die, and we cannot die. Wen Tianxiang's reply to the Yuan minister Boluo can serve as an annotation for us. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Boluo said, "Tell me, has there ever been a minister in ancient times who handed over the ancestral temples, cities, and land to another country and then ran away? Is there such a person?" I (referring to Tianxiang) said, "Offering the country to others is the act of a traitorous minister. Those who sell their country do so for profit. I was dismissed from my position as prime minister the other day and did not take office. I was sent as an envoy to Boyan's army and was subsequently detained. Later, a traitorous minister offered the country. The country was lost, and I should have died. The reason I did not die was because Emperor Duzong's two sons were in Zhejiang and my old mother was in Guangdong, so I left..." He also said, "What merit did you achieve by establishing the two kings?" I said, "The country unfortunately perished, and I established a ruler to preserve the ancestral temples. For every day it exists, the subjects fulfill their responsibility for that day. What merit is there?" He said, "Since you knew you couldn't do it, why did you do it?" I said, "A minister serves his ruler as a son serves his father. If the father unfortunately falls ill, even if he knows it cannot be helped, how can he not prescribe medicine? I have exhausted my heart. Today, Wen Tianxiang is here, there is only death, why say more!"</p>
<p>The so-called dying when one should die but not dying is because one can still establish a ruler to preserve the country. The so-called doing what one knows cannot be done but still doing it is because as long as the country exists, one must exhaust one's heart as a minister for one day. One cannot have negative thoughts immediately because the country has perished, and one cannot lose active thoughts immediately because things cannot be done. One must exhaust one's heart and strength before dying. This is what is meant by "dying when one should not die, doing what can be done; when it is truly impossible to do, then only die." (Preface to Biography of Prime Minister Wen by Xu Youren of the Yuan Dynasty) Such death is bright and upright, with lasting integrity, heavier than Mount Tai, and worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>Today's China is in a period of arduous resistance. Everyone must also maintain such an active concept, putting the country and nation above all else, prioritizing military victory, vowing to be unwavering, and persevering to the end. Then the War of Resistance will surely be victorious, and the nation-building will surely be successful. The so-called dying when one should not die, doing what can be done, knowing that the environment is difficult and the work is not easy, it is better to jump out of this environment and go to a favorable place to struggle and work. One must not have negative thoughts, taking sacrificing oneself as bravery and giving up life as justice. This kind of unfavorable exchange benefits neither oneself nor the nation, only making meaningless sacrifices and can only be regarded as a sign of weakness. Having been moved by the news in the newspaper of those who are unwilling to sell their souls often committing suicide, I have written this in a jumble to offer further words to those who remain on the isolated island.</p>

<p>(Seen in the May issue of this newspaper in the eleventh year of Tongzhi of the Late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>There were two small households in Wusong, living as neighbors. The two men were of the same age and each had a wife. According to custom, women who are married but have not had children often return to their maiden home. Moreover, both husbands went out to work, and had not seen their wives for long after marrying them. One day, the two husbands returned home from the province. Their mothers picked up their wives to bring them back, so that they could enjoy human relationships. The two families went to pick them up on the same day, and the wives returned on the same day. When they returned home, it was already dusk, and they each recognized the wrong door, leading to a switch. When it dawned, they took out the keys to open the chests and pick out old items, but nothing matched. Only then did they realize the mistake. Fortunately, the two men had met before, so they exchanged them as before.</p>

<p>A certain person felt unwell and wore a crepe gauze fur robe to the Yuyuan Garden in the city temple to relax. He met someone preaching about karma and sat down to listen. Suddenly, a person came along, also well-dressed, smoking a dry pipe, and sat next to him. Inadvertently, a fire fell on his fur robe. He quickly put it out, but it had already formed a charred hole. The person was extremely frightened and offered to take it to the weaving shop behind Dongyuan Gate to have it mended. The person had no choice and agreed to his request. At the shop, he paid for the weaving. The person said that standing and waiting was boring, so he might as well go to a nearby hotel for a drink. Seeing that he was so attentive, the person felt sorry. They went into the shop, but after a few cups, the person complained that the wine was not good and got up to go to the temple to buy Shi Gong wine, entrusting the person to watch over his handkerchief, because the person had personally seen more than twenty yuan in the handkerchief when paying for the weaving. After waiting for a long time and he did not return, he looked and there was nothing left. Going back to the weaving shop, the fur robe had also been taken away, it was said.</p>

<p>A certain opium den in the north of the city was closed due to some matter.

It is strange that rats have a smoking addiction.</p>

<p>Northern Japonica Not Yet Sampled, Change Yuan Once Called 21 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, various sources, the riverbanks, and the south port of Fengjing and other No. 6 and Wagon Steamer bun delivered 1,400 to 1,500 packages of Jiangsu and Tong origins. Market conditions: after the Grain Association announced strict price limits, the price was set at 55 yuan, which had already felt slightly clearer. Unexpectedly, when the market opened yesterday, hoarders suddenly came forward to pull up prices, causing prices to surge temporarily on the customer's side. The central market all reached the price limit of 14 yuan, and the second-tier goods also opened at 13.67 yuan, and the market situation suddenly became chaotic again. Then, Southern japonica and thin rice, whether in the central market, were sold for 15 yuan, while the South Port early and late rice river goods were originally limited to 14.5 yuan, so they could not be raised. They all pushed out their old goods, seemingly maintaining the original price, but actually tightening secretly. At the same time, Northern japonica, such as high-quality materials, originally had a normal premium of 0.5 to 1 yuan compared to Southern japonica. At this time, the capital was heavy, and it was unbearable not to distinguish between good and bad. The goods were given the same price without distinction, so the owners gave no samples by agreement, so that japonica such as Changshu, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Changzhou, although some people wanted to purchase retail grain in the market, there was no way to buy it, and it presented a shapeless lack of market. Because the sources of Du Yang sharp rice and Bu sharp rice are inherently limited, the situation is the same as Northern japonica, lacking goods for the market. Therefore, the overall market is chaotic and actually desolate. Because Change Yuan is a seasonal hot product and is not subject to price limits, the price continues to rise, and the price once reached 21 yuan. The actual opening price for high-quality goods was 20 yuan, and the price for medium-quality goods was 19.5 yuan.</p>
<p>In short, although the Rice Industry Association has repeatedly tried to curb this situation, limiting high-quality japonica to 15 yuan, the same for Yang Du sharp rice, and other sharp rice limited to 14 yuan, the difference between middle and second grades, the differentiation of goods is difficult to clarify. According to recent investigations from April to the present, rice-producing areas in the interior have been monopolized by certain parties. After the price of brown rice has risen sharply, the capital of goods coming to Shanghai has begun to appear expensive, about outside the price limit. The owners of the goods are also difficult to operate due to capital relations. However, according to the actual figures investigated by the Fair Price Association, the Shanghai warehouse still has more than 600,000 packages. Among them, the capital of various goods, such as stale goods from the previous year, and the goods in the warehouse from January, February, and March of this year, are still numerous. If the high-priced market is 12–13 yuan at that time, plus interest and warehouse rent, it seems that there can still be profits according to the current price limit. Therefore, for complicated rice situation, the Shanghai Grain Association is responsible for seeking proper methods, so the food prospects of Shanghai citizens are really relying on it.</p>

<p>Regarding War Losses</p>
<h3 id="e129">Discussion on Handling Methods (Continued) <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Shanchi</p>
<p>1. For properties that have fallen into the war zone, if it is determined that they have not been damaged, but it is temporarily impossible to dispose of them and exercise ownership rights, they should be indicated separately and listed as "war zone assets." Those that have been determined to be damaged should be treated as war losses.</p>
<p>2. Accounts receivable that arose before the war, if proven uncollectible, should be listed as war losses. If it is not possible to confirm whether they can be collected, and the reason is that the debtor's whereabouts are unknown, they should be listed as war losses after two years. If it is not due to the debtor's whereabouts being unknown, but it is temporarily impossible to collect them, they should be indicated separately after verification and listed as "pre-war extended accounts receivable."</p>
<p>3. For the valuation of properties listed as war losses, the last book price before the war should be the standard. For fixed assets with depreciation reserves, inventory with price decline reserves, and accounts receivable with bad debt reserves, they should be deducted from the original price separately, and the remaining balance should be listed as losses.</p>
<p>4. "War zone assets" should still be depreciated annually. "Pre-war extended accounts receivable" should still be subjected to annual bad debt write-offs.</p>
<p>5. Maintenance costs for war zone properties should be treated as loss expenses for the respective year. Transportation costs for war zone properties should be listed as war losses.</p>
<p>6. For businesses with war zone properties that have not been verified and sorted out, if there is a surplus at the end of the accounting period, it should all be used as war loss reserves and no dividends should be distributed.</p>
<p>7. After war losses have been verified and confirmed, the original public reserve should be used to compensate them first. The amount that is not enough to compensate should be included in the loss calculation for the current year.</p>
<p>8. Regarding the order of priority for using the public reserve to compensate for losses, the accumulated surplus and undistributed surplus should be used first, followed by optional reserves without designated purposes, then optional reserves with designated purposes but without external contractual relationships, and finally statutory reserves.</p>
<p>9. When war losses are listed as losses, causing a loss in the current year, the amount of the loss should be compensated first in future years when a net profit is generated.</p>
<p>10. If the amount of the loss exceeds one-half of the total capital, a shareholders' meeting should still be convened within the possible scope to decide on the direction of progress and remedial measures. If the loss is too large, resulting in insufficient assets to offset debts, if the business can still continue and there is a clear hope for recovery in the future, it may be allowed to obtain the consent and understanding of the creditors and temporarily be exempted from declaring bankruptcy. If it has already stalled and there is no clear hope for recovery in the future, bankruptcy should still be declared.</p>
<p>11. When convening a shareholders' meeting, the number of shares of shareholders whose addresses are unknown and cannot be notified may be discussed separately. (This is a temporary remedy when a shareholders' meeting cannot be convened.)</p>
<p>12. If the shares have not been fully paid, collection should begin in all cases when there is a loss. If they cannot be collected within one year, the shareholder's rights should be suspended. At this time, the calculation of the amount of the loss should be based on whether it exceeds one-third of the total amount of paid-up capital after collection (including previous collections). If it is necessary to increase or decrease capital, the portion of the outstanding shares may be calculated after being combined into whole shares in proportion to the outstanding amount. (This clause is a temporary remedy for the loss of shareholder rights. According to the provisions of the Company Law, if the shares are not paid after two collection notices, the company may declare the shareholder's loss of rights and auction their shares. However, in fact, after the war, shareholders may have relocated due to force majeure and cannot pay on time, so for tolerance, it is advocated to only suspend the exercise of their shareholder rights. However, if it is necessary to increase or decrease capital at this time, then for the uncollected shares, the only option is to first implement a reduction in capital by combining the number of shares.)</p>
<p>13. For businesses that have suffered war losses and consequently have losses, before the losses have been fully compensated, if there is a surplus, the government should be requested to temporarily exempt them from paying income tax in order to "sympathize with commercial banks" and maintain the tax base. However, once the losses have been fully compensated, the tax should still be paid as usual. (According to the provisions of the Income Tax Law, losses from the previous year cannot be included in the calculations for the following year, but this is in normal times. If industries and businesses have suffered losses during wartime, it is a major blow to their vitality, and the reason for the losses is not due to poor management. The government should give special leniency to allow them to recover as soon as possible. At the same time, the government has a profit tax on businesses that have earned extraordinary profits due to the war, so it should also exempt businesses that have become losses due to the war in order to be fair.)</p>
<p>14. In order to take care of the company's and the majority of shareholders' capital turnover, even if the war losses have not been fully compensated, if the losses have not reached one-third of the total capital, they may be allowed to distribute dividends not exceeding 5% per annum in years when there is a surplus, but interest income tax on dividend income should still be paid as usual. (According to the provisions of the Company Law on businesses that require long-term construction, there was originally a construction interest method, so it seems that it may be useful here.)</p>
<p>The above methods are all applicable during the current war period and have a passive nature. As for the future, after the war has ended, in order to seek the restoration and prosperity of the entire industry and commerce, we should also seek relief measures from the active side, such as issuing reconstruction bonds and holding industrial and commercial loans. These are all effective relief measures, but since they are not within the scope of this article, they will not be discussed for the time being. (End)</p>

<p>Marital discord is the most painful thing in life. Because the union of husband and wife is for the following purposes: (1) to satisfy physiological needs; (2) to regulate daily life; (3) to help and cooperate in academic and career pursuits; (4) to have children and continue the lineage; (5) to build a happy family and lay the foundation for a new society. The ancients said: "All things in heaven and earth originate from the union of husband and wife." Indeed, if all couples in society can be loving and harmonious, have children, and build happy and healthy families, with the husband and wife supporting each other and working together to advance their careers, to shoulder the mission entrusted to them by society, the nation, and the times, this would truly be a driving force for progress and a new cell in a good society. If this could be achieved, wouldn't the nation be prosperous and the people be at peace, with boundless daily progress?</p>
<p>But if a couple is constantly arguing, or even fighting and abusing each other, or contemplating divorce, then they are living with an enemy all day long. Not only is their life extremely painful, but it also affects everything around them, and the society, the nation, and the people will all suffer negative consequences.</p>
<p>Because of the wonders of creation, husband and wife each have physiological needs, so they love and cherish each other, and are intimate and affectionate. This is very natural. Because in their life of love, they not only bring joy to themselves, but also to each other. Why not do it? Having children is a natural consequence. Because love exists between them, they help and cooperate with each other in their careers and academic pursuits, discussing and consulting with each other. This is even less likely to cause problems, because everyone wants to go to heaven, and who would willingly fall into hell?</p>
<p>From this perspective, why do couples bicker? There must be a reason. And the root cause must be a lack of love. Why do couples lack love? According to medical opinions, it must be due to some physical defect in one or both partners. Such defects are more common in men. If a man has engaged in masturbation or nocturnal emission in his youth, or has indulged in promiscuity or suffered from overwork and injury, then he may experience spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, thin or infertile semen, and neurasthenia due to the inherent dysfunction. In such a situation, the couple may have the name of marriage but not the reality. If they cannot find joy in their bodies and minds, how can she not be resentful? As a result, love breaks down, couples bicker, or even stage other kinds of tragedies!</p>
<p>A clever husband who wants to turn discord into love has only one solution: to fundamentally cure the disease. According to the experience of world-renowned doctors and myself, taking the gonadotropin preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素) is the most effective treatment. This drug can generate sperm, nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain and blood, and nourish the nerves within one day and night after taking it. Continued use will completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time. It can also prolong life. However, those who suffer from nocturnal emission must also take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (希米脫氏固精片) to strengthen the seminal gate and stop leakage. This will treat both the symptoms and the root cause, and the effect will be even faster.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Defect of Atrophied Breasts – The Most Obvious Effect of Compensation in Spring <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>No matter what you do, if you don't think about it from the root, it will ultimately fail. Now, let's talk about women's love for beauty. Many women don't think about their own health, but only focus on decoration. What's the use of that? For example, a very young girl, because she is often sick and in pain, loses her health and loses the most precious characteristic beauty of women – atrophied breasts, thin buttocks, and withered muscles. Even if she wears the most fashionable clothes and is covered in makeup, she will only look like a skeleton covered in skin. Where is the beauty that moves people? Moreover, men's eyes are so sharp now! They look at women with the standard of curvaceous beauty. If curvaceous beauty is lost, they will sneer or give a cold glance. Therefore, such women are bound to fail in the pursuit of love! As a result, their fate will be very tragic! To remedy this, one must thoroughly realize the problem and take the ovarian preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素) for women, which is unanimously recommended by world-renowned doctors. After taking it for one day and night, it can nourish the ovarian function, promote metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea. This drug is the result of more than 30 years of arduous experimentation by Austrian medical sage Dr. Stan, who extracted the essence of the ovaries from extremely healthy female animals and reproduced it by scientists. Therefore, the medicinal properties are mild and the efficacy is great. It can be taken regularly in both winter and summer, and there are no side effects. If taken in the spring, when all things are growing and developing, the effect will be even more significant. All kinds of gynecological diseases can be completely cured in a short period of time, promoting development, gradually raising the breasts, making the buttocks fuller, and the cheeks rosy, improving health and beauty.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Serious Crisis After Untreated Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is a common disease among young people. After discovering nocturnal emission, most people don't worry about it, and even think of it as a joyful thing. Because children like to imitate the behavior of adults, knowing that they are adults makes them very happy. Therefore, young people in the period of spring passion often have nocturnal emission, or even masturbate to induce nocturnal emission, which is even more common.</p>
<p>If nocturnal emission continues to be frequent or is delayed and not treated, the root of the disease will inevitably deepen, and the symptoms will worsen. Some people develop spermatorrhea from nocturnal emission. Some people become sallow and thin, mentally weakened, forgetful and insomniac, suffer from back pain, incomplete development, premature ejaculation, impotence, and thin and infertile semen. There are too many such cases to count. These weak young people, although still young, are already sluggish and do not seek progress in learning and clothing, because they are already powerless. Even in the most basic married life, they will not satisfy their wives, and tragedies will often occur between husband and wife. In short, the future crisis is unimaginable! The most effective treatment for nocturnal emission at this time is to continuously take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (希米脫氏固精片) to strengthen the seminal gate and calm the nerves, so that dreams at night are reduced, one can get a good night's sleep, and nocturnal emission will naturally be cured. However, those who have already caused the above symptoms due to nocturnal emission must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Sheng Fa Su" (生髮素) to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use will completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and can also prolong life. Therefore, the above-mentioned good medicines are all praised by world-renowned doctors and have long been popular around the world, with good reputation. All pharmacies sell them.</p>
<h3 id="e134">A Letter from a Promising Young Man: Brain Decay and Kidney Deficiency Almost Destroyed My Future <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Jia Ming of Fahua Town, West Shanghai</p>
<p>Dr. Yao and Dr. Zhan: In order not to be slaves, and not to live a decadent life in the city, we moved west with our family before the fall of Nanshi after August 13. Because of the obstruction of transportation, we didn't reach Zhenjiang and Nanjing fell. Forced to do so, we turned around and returned to Shanghai from Jiangbei. Because we suffered too much wind and frost along the way, our bodies were naturally damaged. But I didn't want to waste my precious time, so I enrolled in a school to study foreign languages and also took a teaching position in a school, hoping to learn from each other and enrich my internal knowledge. I thought that this approach could be considered ambitious in a time of crisis. But the nocturnal emission I had before relapsed. At first, it was two or three times a month, mostly due to dreams. Later, it was without dreams, and it was almost ten times a month. The human body is made of flesh and blood, how can it withstand the massive loss of this source of life? Therefore, symptoms such as mental weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, back pain, and premature ejaculation came one after another. Every question in the curriculum, which I could answer fluently without thinking in the past, I can't find the answer to now, and eventually I make mistakes. I am absent-minded during the day and awake and unable to sleep at night. My wife, wanting me to sleep soundly, repeatedly comforted me with tenderness, but to no avail. Therefore, my wife went from resentment to hatred, and had the intention of asking for a divorce. At the same time, due to the lack of energy, I dropped out of school and also lost my job. In this situation, with a vast future, the pain in my heart is simply indescribable!</p>
<p>When things are at their worst, a savior appears unexpectedly. While sick, I happened to read your articles in the health knowledge column of the Shen Bao. It said that for symptoms of brain decay and kidney deficiency, taking the gonadotropin preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素) is the most effective treatment. For nocturnal emission, taking "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (希米脫氏固精片) is the best. So I asked my wife to buy a dozen of each from the Zhongxi Pharmacy, and took both at the same time. On the first day and night, I felt refreshed and the symptoms were reduced. After finishing one dozen, not only did nocturnal emission not recur, but the above symptoms were also completely cured. What is even more valuable is that my brainpower is more abundant and my energy is exceptionally rich. Therefore, my wife said to me with a smile: We are newlyweds again. Then, isn't the reappearance of a bright future given to me by you? I am writing this letter to express my gratitude and to inform those with the same illness. I wish you good health!</p>

<h3 id="e135">Exhibition of Refugee Products <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Feiyun</p>
<p>Featuring Cotton Weaving, Embroidery, Socks, and Towels - All Practical Household Items</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a refugee product exhibition at the First Reception Center on Wenjianshi Road (蓬路) from May 5th to 11th.</p>
<p>The venue was originally a reception center, which was also the Qianye Guild Hall, accommodating more than 1,000 male and female refugees.</p>
<p>According to the people in charge of the reception center, from last month onwards, only refugees who are able to produce are allowed to live there. Whether they go out to do business themselves or work in the reception center, in short, only refugees who can support themselves are qualified to live in the reception center.</p>
<p>As for why the Relief Association held this exhibition on May 5th, it is stated in their special opening remarks: May 5th is the National Production Conference, and they decided to mobilize in the production and construction movement.</p>
<p>But I believe that the main purpose of this exhibition is to point out that under good guidance, the working ability of refugees is not worse than anyone else.</p>
<p>As far as I personally saw, the various cotton products on display at the exhibition, such as embroidered cushions, handbags, floral pillowcases, white cloth shirts and trousers, white gloves, woolen vests, and socks, were not much different from those produced by national goods companies, but their prices were so cheap.</p>
<p>In terms of the types of products, they were divided into cotton weaving, woodworking, bamboo work, clay, paper, grass weaving, and many other household items.</p>
<p>Entering the venue, there is a corridor. On both sides of the corridor, colorful paper lanterns are hung. There are also glass cabinets on both sides, displaying various cotton weaving and embroidery products. There are also several models, one is "Defend and Fight", one is "Free New China", and one is a port of all China. Although these models are not very exquisite, the refugees' concept of China's victory in the war of resistance can be seen to be very strong.</p>
<p>The exhibition venue is in the center of the entire building, which was originally a large courtyard for watching dramas. Because there is still a large stage in the middle, and now this stage has also been converted into the residence of refugees.</p>
<p>Among the toys, there are also airplanes, cannons, and warships. Although they are not manufactured very exquisitely, these toys can still be used as educational toys for children.</p>
<p>A painting exhibition is also held in the venue. The author is Mr. Wu Xiaoshi. The works are not very mature, but Mr. Wu was originally a refugee. It is said that the money from selling the exhibited works is donated to the refugees.</p>
<p>The refugees in the venue are also polite, serving as marshals and receptionists. It is said that on the 5th, they actually sold more than 40 yuan. However, in my opinion, there are not many people visiting the venue. I hope that the ladies who like to choose domestic products can go there to buy many practical items. There are all kinds of towels, mops, and bamboo products.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I took a look at the beds where the refugees slept in the reception center. They were all built with bamboo heads and divided into two layers. There is a complete primary school in the reception center: there are also women's tutorial classes and adult classes in the evening.</p>
<p>The rice that the reception center burns every day, the refugees can buy a pound for three cents, and two meals of white rice can be had for six cents a day.</p>
<p>Finally, I will copy Mr. Qu Yingguang's inscription for this exhibition here as the end of this article:</p>
<p>The flames of war are everywhere, and the ravines are full of survivors;</p>
<p>The refugees are in a miserable situation, and the pain is great;</p>
<p>Overcoming the environment, both hands are omnipotent;</p>
<p>Self-sufficient and working together, the products are displayed in abundance;</p>
<p>The scale is improved, and the effectiveness is increasing day by day;</p>
<p>Ten years of recuperation, the founding of the country will be successful!</p>

<p>Chapter Nine: Bearing Grief and Suffering, Tears Sprinkling in All Directions; Practicing Thrift and Diligence, Working Hard in Ten Acres</p>
<p>At that time, the director, Mr. Jin, selected her to play the heroine Xiangzi in the play, which can be considered a competent and happy choice. Miss Lin was initially afraid to agree, because she didn't know if there was anything in the play that would hurt her mother's feelings. You should know that Miss Lin is very filial to her mother. Her mother only gave birth to her, a daughter, after marrying Mr. Lin. Later, Mr. Lin passed away again, and the mother and daughter depended on each other for life. She knew her mother's pity, and half of this play was somewhat similar to her mother. In case her mother felt unwilling, Miss Lin would not play it. Director Jin said: "There is absolutely no such thing! Even in the era of the War of Resistance, the private friendship between the nationals of the two countries was still very good. What's more, the war is already a thing of the past. If you don't believe it, please take the script back to your mansion and ask Mrs. Lin to look over it, because she is very proficient in Chinese characters. Before the public performance, we will also ask her to guide everything." Miss Lin went back and asked her mother. Mrs. Lin was very satisfied with the script and told her daughter to play it. Because the first scene is the situation of Xiangzi and Chen Jun in Tokyo when they were studying. All the sets are Japanese customs, and the clothes worn by Xiangzi are also Japanese attire. If it were another Chinese female student, even if she practiced, she would not be so skilled. But Miss Lin didn't need to practice. She had been wearing Japanese clothes since she was a child, so her demeanor was very natural and calm, and she didn't feel forced at all. This Miss Lin, her name is Guihong, is very smart and has a talent for acting. The male lead who played Chen Jun was also a talented student from the Faculty of Arts of Soochow University. He had also been to Japan. No one who watched this play at the sad place did not shed tears. Both Miss He Shuangyu and Miss He Liyu had swollen eyes. The two American ladies sitting behind them, who could also speak Chinese, had already burst into tears. Wu Junsu just wiped his glasses, put on the glasses, and took them off to wipe them again. In less than two minutes, he took them off to wipe them. Jin Danyun gently said to Wu Junsu: "Why do you want to write such a tragedy? It makes people feel sad after watching it." Zhu Airen sighed and said, "This can show the sins of the invaders at that time. All peace was destroyed by those who harmed humanity, fought and killed each other. Just think about it, what deep hatred and resentment do humans have with humans, why should they fight each other desperately, as if there can't be you in the world if there is me. Now that I think about it, why bother?" (104)</p>

<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>I lecture on my own "A New Compilation of the History of Chinese Literature" (Beixin Edition) at the university. Most of the students who choose the drama section have never read the original works. In desperation, I advised the students to go to Xianle Grand Theatre in Xieqiao Lane to watch the Kunqu opera of Xianni Society in their spare time, because everything they perform, including Yuan Dynasty Zaju opera, Ming and Qing Dynasty Zaju legendary, is available. Now I will list the plays they can perform (according to Xu Diaofu's Xianni Society Drama Index, unpublished) in detail compared with my literary history, and also give a reference to comrades who have read my immature work:</p>

<p>"Artists Models Abroad" Produced by Paramount, Shown at the Nanjing Grand Theatre</p>
<p>Produced by Paramount, Shown at the Nanjing Grand Theatre</p>
<p>"Models Tour Paris" - What a glamorous and tempting translation!</p>
<p>The main actors are Joan Bennett and Jack Benny. Jack Benny has the same old face as Jack Oakie, so the story of "Models Tour Paris" is based on Jack Benny, not Joan Bennett.</p>
<p>The story is like this: The American "Artists and Models Abroad Song and Dance Troupe" is performing in Paris. Due to poor business, it owes a huge amount of rent and is evicted by the landlord. The troupe leader is Booker Boswell, who has no way out and wanders the streets. He happens to meet the young girl Patricia Herbert and invites her to join the song and dance troupe. The girl is the daughter of American oil tycoon Herbert. Herbert is very angry when he learns that his daughter has joined the song and dance troupe and goes to the hotel to negotiate. Just when the hotel owner calls the police, Booker and others jump out of the window and escape into the art museum. At this time, a female art exhibition is being held in the art museum. Booker impersonates the Russian representative and leads the crowd to participate. There is the Seraphine Diamond of Nahe at the meeting. Herbert loves his daughter deeply, but is refused to sell by the curator, so he secretly steals it. At that time, a Dutch merchant representative signed a contract to sell the oil field to Herbert. Booker, suspecting Herbert's strange behavior, tore up the contract. Later, the diamond was discovered, and the US consulate also proved that Herbert was indeed an oil merchant. At the same time, the price of the oil field rose. Herbert deeply appreciated Booker's tearing up of the contract, and the girl married Booker.</p>
<p>Jack Benny may be able to make the audience who are entertained for entertainment laugh a few times by playing the troupe leader Booker. Joan Bennett simply has no role to play.</p>
<p>In such a story, the director can only mess around as much as possible to finish it, so-called fighting,吵闹, jumping and闹闹 only. That is, the highly anticipated model show, because of the messy weaving, only introduces various latest fashions. The audience who went for the temptation of this translation must be very disappointed. The only thing that can be勉强 mentioned is the scene on the street after the troupe members are evicted by the hotel owner, which is quite lively and has a strong emotional atmosphere.</p>
