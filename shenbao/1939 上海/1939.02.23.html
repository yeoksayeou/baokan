<p>社評</p>
<h3>難民十萬</h3>
<p>昨言上海近况，畸形榮枯之甚。云何榮？工商百業殆以去歲爲空前之豐年。云何枯？人浮於事，失業者不知其凡幾；物價騰貴，入不敷出者不知凡幾。而十萬難民。不但入不敷出，抑且絕無所入：不但失業，抑且失其鄉里，失其廬舍，失其生計，甚至失其父母，失子女，失兄弟姊妹，夫或失婦，婦或失夫；若非仰給於救濟，無衣無食無宿所，得衣得食亦未必溫且飽，此枯之允也。咫尺之內，榮枯判如霄壤；彼何辜而成難民，自念何幸而非難民，誠無鄉黨戚族之誼，顧可漠然耶？</p>
<p>十萬，至巨之數也。上海有黃包車一萬輛，往來但見黃包車，况乃十倍之。今之十萬難民，幸而收容有所，不致流落街頭；非然者，我人必觸處皆見難民羣。試默思之：觸處而爲十倍於黃包車之無衣無食無宿所之男女老幼，能母目擊心傷，寢饋不安乎？藉曰無所不忍，然有十萬人焉，共求生命於此十里洋塲之中，無衣而求衣，無食而求食，無宿所而求宿所，饑寒交迫，風雨交加，莫能濟之，顧誰能制之，亦無法制之。則吾儕幸而不屬其儔者，有衣得安衣乎，有食得安食乎，崇樓廣廈得安居乎，高車駟馬得安行乎？無論富商大賈無以自安，即油條店大餅攤勢亦未能安於營生。試默思之，此爲何種景象乎？</p>
<p>正惟收容有所，故難民之慘痛，未必爲一般人所能眞切體會。雖然，是又何必見難民·親難民·始得體會難民之慘痛。但請就一已一日間之物質精神生活，逐一假想之於一無所有之難民，謂不寢饋不安者，竊不信也。爲舉數端：茲値新春，糕果酒肉是何旨味，酬神敬祖是何意念，親朋周旋是何歡樂，呼么喝六是何點綴？此原非人人然，家家然，或不好爲，或不屑爲；然此旨味意念歡樂點綴者，極普遍，極平常，人人知之領略之，難民欲爲而不得也。一日之計在晨，一年之計在春，欣逢易歲矣，於是而除舊布新，於是而奮發有爲，於是而有種種未來之憧憬，難民則計無所出也。抗戰建國，有錢出錢，有力出力，難民則空懷悲憤而無以自効也。誰無性靈，我若此而難民若彼，能不惻然耶！</p>
<p>救濟難民，非異人任；凡非難民，責無旁貸；貧富皆然，各視其心力而已。要知惻隱之心，與生俱來，未可以一念之自私自利而吝惜而汨沒。互助之道，爲生存基礎，自骨肉至親推而至於宗族親朋，社會國家，不能互助則衰亡，愈能互助則愈昌；此非僅道德之因果，亦利害成敗之必要關鍵也。而救濟難民者，既以惻隱而慈善，亦以道德與利害成敗之因果關鍵而互助；慈善爲發於天理人情之責任，互助爲維繫人類羣居之責任。抑此所謂責任，初非艱鉅難盡，不聞救濟機關之呼籲乎？難民每人每月所需，不過國幣兩圓；是以力勝千圓，則月活五百之衆；捐助一圓，亦敷一人半月之糧；即使一分二分亦屬衆擎易舉之道；然則凡非難民，誰不能盡其責任乎？况難民由國難，咎不在乎其人，非因罪惡而貧賤之比也。幸而不爲難民者，又豈功德所致，機綠凑合，幸而未落難耳；易地而處，我人亦將不免於需人救濟。或不自菲薄於無功無德，而曰惟功惟德始免爲難民；則允必知盡心盡力以救濟難民，是當前之功德也。</p>

<p>（續昨）我們怎麽樣來盡我們確立民主政治基礎的責仟呢、中正今天得與各位以參政員同人的地位　互相砥礪、要購明我們中華民國所要造成的眞正民主政治是什麽、以及我們所必須遵循的方法和步驟是什麽、總理貫通中西學理、深知世界潮流和國內的現狀、本其四十年革命的經騐、手創三民主義、期致中華民族於富强康樂的境界、總理對於民主的理想、是要實行較並世各國更澈底更切實的民主政治、在民權主義中、一則批評天賦民權的學說、而主張革命的民權、二則要使人民完全享有選舉·罷免·創制·複决·共四種直接民權、這是總理以後來居上的精神、著眼於最高遠的所在、但是總理不懂是一個理想家、而且是一個革命的實行家、他的理想越是高遠、步驟越是切實、總理以爲必須人民能　行革命主義、完畢革命義務、纔可授與以初步的民權、又以爲人民必須經過行使四權的訓練、纔可以充分的使用民權、總理所欲造成的民主政治、是不着一毫虛僞、不帶一絲勉强的民主政治、我國人民承累代專制的弊習、民智民力、異常薄弱、人民散漫和自私、國內又有不少的障碍、以如此的背景、要逢到如此的理想、當然要從辛苦而切近處下手、斷不能一蹴而幾、因之總理對於完成革命工作的實施步驟，定爲軍政·訓政·憲政·的三個時期、國民政府成立以後、遵奉總理遺敎、先求全國之開始訓政、原希望積極的促成憲政的實現、早達革命建國的目的、不幸統一未成、而障碍復起、經五六年之久、傾國家之人力財力的一大半、都用於軍政時期之工作、喘息甫定、敵寇侵略、愈入愈深、政府爲保障國家的主權、民挨的生命、起而應戰、苦戰十九個月、我國土地的淪陷、人民的損失、實不可以道里數量計、就目前事實而論、不僅訓政時期的工作、受到打斷阻碍、而軍政時期應做的工作、且須從頭再做一遍、換句話說、必須首先掃蕩侵略者的武力、消滅漢奷傀儡破壞國家治安民族的反革命勢力、待山河恢復、國內澄淸以後、才談得到訓政、進而預備憲政、因此嚴格的說來、我們目前還在軍政時期之中、這時期的工作、按建國大綱的第六條、應該是、「一切制度、悉隸於軍政之下政府一面用兵力掃除國內之障碍、一面宣傳主義、以開化全國之人心、」但是上面已經說過、我們國家民挨當前的需要是抗戰建國同時進行、我們必須集中民意、發動民力、積極準備戰後建國的完成、同時我們在抗戰之中、人民對於國家的責任觀念、與三民主義的驟識、也必須使之提高、因之能在掃蕩障碍的軍政時期、而訓政工作、仍然要同時進行、爲迅速完成革命的偉業、不僅應該在不妨碍軍政的範圍內、積極推動訓政、同時更希望由訓政之進行、可以補助軍政、所以我們必須明瞭在抗戰沒有結束以前、當然是「軍事第一」要以軍政根本的工作爲主、而一面積極進行訓政的工作、這個認識、是萬不可少、吾則一切工作、就失了重心、因爲我們所要造成的是澈底的民主政治、所以斷不能忽略程序和步驟、同時因爲我們國家數千年來習於專制政治、人民的心理習慣、沒有過問政治的素養和訓練、要施行民主政治、前途障碍、旣須剷除、一切根基、均待確定、所以又必須經過革命的建設、總理當時除劃分革命過程爲三個時期之外、並且沉痛的警誡我們說、「辛亥之役、數月以內、耶推倒四千餘年之君主專制政體、曁二百六十餘年之滿洲征服階級、其破壞之力、不可謂不巨、然至今日、三民主義之實行、猶茫乎未有端緒者、則以破壞之後、初未嘗依預定之程序、以爲建設也、」因爲當時一般人、忽略一定的自然程序、而侈談民治、以致辛亥以來、的法等於具文、而禍亂相循、以致國家的法律、變成政客軍閥作惡活動的工具、不特民主政治未能實現、而且爲民主政治造了多少障碍和罪孽、正如法國大革命時有一位革命家的名言、「自由自由、天下多少罪惡假汝之名以行、」我們現在要矯正這個錯誤、必須從頭做起、而且必須建立我國家民族整個的自由、使國家民族獲得眞正的自由、本會成立以來、我們同人都能犧牲個人的自由、與小我的成見、來奠立眞正民主的基礎、實爲民國成立以來、允其在抗戰期間、最足快慰的一事、深信同人以後必更能服膺總理的遺敎、提倡全國同胞、努力於訓政時期的工作、以負責力行相倡導、而防止再蹈不負責仟蔑視事實的弊病、要使一般同胞、知道民主政治、不能當作無法紀無制度無政府的狀况來看、民主政治所依據的民意、必須是健全的集體的、而且能代表大多數的意志、民主政治所賦予人民的自由、必須是不妨害公共利益不違背國家法律的自由、允其我們國家現在處於外患嚴重的時期、我們更要訓迪人民、尊重國家法令權力的絕對性、政府是國家權力之寄託者、是法律的執行者、也就是全體人民的保護者、爲了切實保護全體人民與整個民族的利益、對於破壞法紀破壞制度者、就不能不依法制裁、凡依據法律的制裁、斷不能與壓迫混爲一談、無論在什麼民主政治的國家、都有政府制度和法律、民主政治下的制度和法律、尤其是要受人民尊重、而不能容許少數的破壞、我們要在抗戰之中、奠立民主基礎、不但要使人民切實養成能力、更必須使人民了解民主的眞諦、我們參政員是人民的領導者、要負起訓迪的責任、要保護國家的利益、和全體人民的利益、對於藉口自由民主而破壞國家法令制度、减弱整個抗戰力量的行爲、要一致發揮公正輿論的權威、而加以制止、我們要使一般同胞都明瞭、現在爲抗戰要實行軍政、爲建國要實行調政、這中間着不得一些虛僞、容不得有幾微障碍、我們必須借鑑已往的覆轍、切實遵循總理遺敎所訂的步驟、爲眞正的民主政治、奠立永久而良好的基礎、總理一生、在政治上的奮鬥目的、是要實現三民主義、而歸政於民、但是不經過訓練的人民、是决不能主政的、總理生前勉勵我們知識階級與革命同志、要作民衆的保姆、要以公僕的地位、實行師保的責任、這一個敎訓、實在是建國成功必循之大道、</p>
<p>中國歷史上有兩段故事、很可以說明訓政的精神、一是伊尹訓太甲、二是周公訓成王、太甲即位年齡尚幼、伊尹殷切吿誡、後人輯爲伊訓篇、太甲不能聽、納習於不義、伊尹使他住在桐宮、一方面替他執行政事、一方面苦於設法、不避勞怨的管敎他、商書太甲上中下三篇、反復訓導、何等忠誠切至、後來太甲悔悟了、負責施政的本領備具了、伊尹歸政於太甲、自己退休、臨去之時、還述了「咸有一德」一篇施政的要義、以訓勉太甲、周公受武王之託、輔翼成王、那時成王還小、一方面防止武庚的反叛、一方面忍受管叔蔡叔的流言、周公的處境、十二分的困難、但是他任勞任怨、忍辱負重、雖然經過無數艱難與苦境、弄得憔悴不堪、終是一心一意的要安定國家、輔敎成王成立、絕不辭勞苦、避責任、詩經上鴟鶚四章、描寫周公苦苦訓導成王的忠心、百世之下、讀之還令人感動看他原書上　鴟鶚鴟鶚、旣取我子、無毀我室、恩斯勤斯、鬵子之閔斯、　迨天之未陰雨、徹彼桑土、綢繆牖戶、今此下民、或敢侮予、　予手拮据、予所捋荼予所蓄租、予口卒瘏、曰予未有室家、　予羽譙譙、予尾翛翛、予室翹翹、風雨所飄搖、予維音曉曉、」最後兩段形容周公的苦痛和疲勞到極點了、雖然拮据辛苦、國家乃有安定、雖然羽毛彫敝、而室家還不免風雨漂搖、由於負責的熱情所激發、託之於急切之悲嗚、這眞値得後代無限的同情和崇敬、後來叛亂平定、成王也被他訓導成功了、他和伊尹一樣歸政成王、他還不放心、又述了一篇「無逸」的敎訓、要成王知道前人創業艱難、競競業業、不可荒怠、我們生逢空前國雞、當建國未成、讀鴟鶚之詩、能不與周公有所同感、總理以伊尹周公相照、是我們國民唯一革命導師、他有軍政·訓政·憲政三個時期的政治革命、國是要先把人民訓練成熟、然後才還政於民、這種盡瘁負責的精神、古今輝映、是何等的偉大、伊尹在「咸有一德」上說「非天私我有商、惟天佑於一德、非商求於下民、惟民歸於一德、」我中華民國推翻專制以後、也有共同遵循的、這就是總理的三民主義、目前同人的工作、是要近桓總理、遠紹伊尹周公的志向、眞正的實行三民主義、使全國同胞誠意「歸於一德、」要實行三民主義、建立民主政治的正正基礎、就是必須我們參政員的同人、一齊肩荷起這個艱鉅的責任、我們是社會人民的領導、首先樹立國民的楷模、盡忠竭誠的敎育民衆、領導民衆、使他們知道自己的責任、了解如何負責任的方法、我們就是伊尹與周公、民衆就是太甲和成王我們要視民衆爲國家的主體、我們要敎他·訓他、最後還政於他、等待他們都成立了、民主政治也實現了、我們要盡到道個使命、必須我們同人在會內會外以身作則、尊重法令、嚴守紀律、竭盡忠誠、負起責任、古人說「其身正、不令而行、「又說「以身敎者從」我們要作民衆的楷模、就必須躬行實踐、負責任、守紀律、我們發表言論、一字一句都要對國家、對人民負責、我們的一舉一動都要遵守國家紀律、以此精神、作民衆表率、民衆自然接受、我們的訓導的民衆、纔能實行眞正的民主政治、政府召集參政會的目的、就是要我們共同負實、做伊尹、做周公、政府希望在軍事結束的時候、訓政的工作已經同時完成、換旬話說、就是抗戰勝利之日、即是建國基礎大定之時、政府對我們如此企望、人民對我們期待允很殷切、我們應該如何努力、　能無負呢、民主政治是否能建立、實任完全在我們、國家民族是吾能復興、責任亦完全在我們、三民主義最終的大同世界所由實現的、目下即禮運上所載的網要、要由我們參政員同心不停的來提倡、纔能國民勤勞、養成互助的風氣、五中全會希望全國致力的加强團結、積極奮門、與加緊建設的三點、由這一次會議中許多議案而更具體化、也要我們參政員同人積極宜傳、率先力行、以風動社會、纔能推進實施的攻效、我們參政會不是平常時代的議事機關、我們由同患難、共甘苦、同心恊力、安危共濟的抗戰禦侮的領導機關、不　爲民意所賴以表現、實在是民力所賴以集中、我們參政員同人、不僅坐而言、而且能起而行、這一種不避艱危、不辭勞苦的實行精神、巳經著有很大的令譽、現在抗戰第二期開始、成敗所關、更爲重要、各位會舉之後、分赴各地、務乘着本屆大會的共同意志和决議、貢獻精誠、貢獻能力、提高我民族精神、發揚我固有道德、對於這一次大會幾個最重要的議案、如加强兵役制度、實行精神動員、推進經濟建設、整頓各地保甲、允其希望各位同人負起倡導推動的責任、各就擔任工作的所在、分頭努力、一一見之於實行、不但政府可以得到不少的帮助、實在爲國家民族與全體同胞所利賴、當此大會閉慕的時候、我瞻念未來艱鉅的工作、對於同舟風雨的各地同价、實在不勝其企望、敬祝諸位共同努力、使抗戰勝利建國成功、（完）（二十一日電）</p>

<h3>華軍堅守潼關　日軍屢圖偷渡未逞截斷隴海路成夢想</h3>
<p>潼關　中日兩軍作戰、雖已將及一年、華軍曾兩次克復風陵渡、最後乃復被日軍所佔、雙方陣錢相距不及二哩、中國民衆之生活、幾與戰前相同、美聯社記者由華軍領導爬山觀察風陵渡、伏地而行、因日方伏兵時施射繫之故也、風陵渡軍事活動極少、因城中日軍不多、且不敢外出、蓋華方狙擊兵極爲活躍、而中國民衆於日軍佔據該城之前、亦早已全部退出、美聯社記者曾見沿黃河岸遍地水泥機槍位、亦有交通壕、據華軍方面稱、一九三八年二月七日以來、日方在潼關放射砲彈四萬枚、是以潼關業已成爲廢墟、民衆極少、日軍擬截斷隴海路未成、潼關原有居民五萬名、現僅餘三萬名、中央政府最近撥款四萬元、以救濟貧民、購買鹽米、建築避免空襲之洞窟（十八日美聯社電）</p>
<p>潼關　黃河原爲中國之患、現已被認爲中國之友、蓋黃河之泥水、爲阻止日軍向西北進展之主要因素、黃河北折之處、中日兩軍陣錢、在潼關與風陵渡之間、相距不及二哩、華軍人士告美聯社記者稱、黃河爲華方之友、蓋去年十二月及今年正月間、氣候和暖、日軍集中企圖渡水、結果失敗、乃不得不利用竹筏及橡皮艇、日軍於正月間曾在潼關以北三十五哩之楡門企圖渡河、復於昨日企圖在風陵渡以東三哩之處偷渡、均遭失敗、日軍以猛烈之砲火掩護步兵渡河、唯華軍則以機槍及大砲抵抗、預料日軍將於三月及六月間進攻、唯七八月間之洪水將阻止日軍渡河、美聯社記者於夜間乘坐舒適之隴海路美國式火車、在離潼關二十哩處下車、火車於開過危險地帶之時、開足速力、日方大砲不斷施行轟擊、記者擬於午夜進入附近城中、守兵不許、乃露天而臥、晨間乃沿路而行、道中灰塵深及六吋、風起時飛塵撲面、記者在潼關附近、因恐日方大砲轟擊、不得不在山徑中暫避、華方大砲乃最新式之外國大砲、其射程較遠、目標準確、曾擊燬日方大砲十門、擊斃日方砲兵百名、不久以前、日軍曾渡河在楡門以東渡河、唯卒被華軍驅回、日軍死四五百人、華軍死傷人數約略相同、據華軍方面宣稱、「隴海路華軍防務最爲堅强、日軍無法自隴海路以南包圍潼關、因該地多山之故、」倘日軍渡河成功、則沿山一帶之華軍壕溝及其他防務、亦足以抵禦日軍之進攻、風陵渡與蒲州之間、有日軍二千名及日方大砲二十門、沿同蒲路則有日軍四千名、華軍實力極爲充足、且多係經驗豐富之戰士、黃河以北之華軍游擊隊、不得南渡、擾亂日軍後方、日軍如欲渡河、必須大增兵力、（十七日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>美英遙相呼應　積極充實國防　美眾院討論增闢軍港英擴充軍備影響重大</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）衆議院頃於本日開始討論添設海空軍根據地法案、會塲空氣、雖甚緊張、但國會休息室中人、咸相信此案必能獲有絕大多數、開會時、首由海軍委員會主席文生、（民主黨）發表長篇演說、爲此案辯護、略謂、「時至今日、獨裁者暴戾恣睢、不可理喻、美國除增闢海空軍根據地而外、別無他途可循、唯有此乃可使獨裁者知所警惕也、不寗唯是、美國且須充實一般的防禦力量、始能有備無患」、至是、共和黨衆議員斐許、即起立質問云、關島地勢險要、一旦設置海空軍根據地、不管以匕首加諸日本咽喉、必在日本方面引起猛烈反饗、國際時局杌隍不安、原巳風聲鶴、草木皆兵、美國在關島設防之後或竟因而引起戰爭、亦未可必、可不愼諸、文生當即答稱、美國並不欲在關島設防僅擬在該島設置航空根據地、用以保護本國與荷蘭屬東印度之交通錢、俾美國所需各項原料品來源、不致中斷、關島設置航空根據地之舉、對於美國海岸防務、關係至重、亞洲强國、凡希兩國在美屬夏威夷羣島美洲大陸者、必因而有所顧忌、不敢輕舉妄動也一、至此、某議員又就英法　侵略美國購買軍用飛機一事、提出質問、文生叉答稱、以軍用飛機供給英法兩大民治國、　即所以維護吾國利益、英法兩國若果毀滅、美國勢必陷於孤立云、按增闢海空軍根據地法案、規定授權政府、以五二、〇〇〇、〇〇〇美元、建造海空軍根據地十二處、並另撥巨款一、八〇〇、〇〇〇美元、作爲硏究航空之用、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）下議院項於本日午後賡續討論國防預算案、張伯倫首相當卽發表演說略謂「下年度國防預算、爲數共五八〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、可與歐戰爆發時吾國國債總相埒、此　意義重大、未知下議院諸君有所見及否、吾人擴充軍備、規模雖大、僅屬防禦性質、吾人旣無侵略意圖云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>張伯倫宣言　努力挽救歐局　裁軍會議時機未至先從恢復信任着手</h3>
<p>（倫敦）張伯倫首相今日在下院開始第二日國防辯論時所發表之言論、要點有二、一即世界各國大規模競爭軍備、殆爲彼此誤會之桔果、一即反對黨不宜吹毛求疵、或作不適當之疑念、致使誤會愈甚、渠昨日傾聽國防辯論時、感覺辯論之際、絕無前此之激昂情緒、與爭辯或惶慮徵象、據所得之一般印象、全院已爲事實所壓迫、並鑒於時局之眞相、乃不得不對於現行擴充軍備計劃、及實施此種計劃、如籌措經費等方法、意見一致、猶憶去年工黨曾一再陳說集體安全與國聯基礎政策之需要、但在今日環境之下、巳了解訴諸國聯之無益、而不得不採用其他方法、以期維持一般和平與本國安全矣、</p>
<p>首相繼言平民防務、較諸海陸空軍三大防務、稍形落後事、謂掌　大臣安德森所領導之組織、刻正採用必要計劃、不久當可宜布、英國空防計劃、巳獲有結果、</p>
<p>首相又譽揚國防調整大臣賈特菲勳爵之才幹、謂其經騐、堪以勝任愉快、惟須出席上院、故特任馬理遜爲共下院代表、俾在下院答復關於國防調整事宜之質問、但非以馬理遜爲軍需大臣也、近來軍械製造量大增、允以航空部所需飛機與其他供給品爲甚、於此可見政府未創立軍需部一舉之適當、</p>
<p>首相繼言及財政情形、謂政府所擬之國防經費、未知下院已認識其完全意義否、其總額爲五萬八千萬鎊、以供五年計畫中最後兩年之用、如最後兩年中尙須增高公債力、則財相不妨冉向下院請求、此說或屬不誤、謂吾人在五年時期後、尙須櫃續舉債、惟渠所注意者、尙不僅此、蓋國防計畫一旦完成後、尙須籌措經常維持費、將來維持費究須幾何、今固不能武斷、惟下院若迥思財相西門所稱、明年稅收中所可得之數爲二萬三千萬鎊、則不能不懷疑、維持此項軍備之常年經費、加以還債基金之息金、能不超出稅收乎、此爲嚴重之點、吾人不可掉以輕心也、</p>
<p>渠今不欲提出如何解决此問題之建議、但如聽任時局發展、長此不已、而不思努力以制止之、則爲罪惡、昨曾有人發言、以爲召集各國舉行軍縮會議之時機已至、苟渠能相信、此時召開此種會議、可獲效果、（會塲中有人呼「盍試爲之」）、渠早已不事猶豫而召集之矣、（聞者鼓掌）、世人尙未成立充分之信任、此時而召開斯會、在實際上爲無效、但若吾人自己稍稍表示信任、而不輕信他國侵略意旨之傳說、則或未嘗無益、渠有時被人指責、不應斥政敵醞釀戰禍、其實　未謂其政敵欲開戰端、但渠以爲政敵現所採行之政策、似爲可導成戰爭之政策耳、吾國軍備、規模雖大、僅爲防禦之用、如他國亦確如英國之未有侵略意旨、則吾人所可得之唯一結論、即爲吾人皆在誤會之下、互相競爭摧毀國家元氣之軍備而已、此說殆有至理、吾人誠不能在未獲他國一般同意减軍以前、稍懈吾人擴充軍備之努力、惟當注視可能的機會、而利用之、以勸吿他國政府、仿行英國現所行之途徑、而終止長此不已必使歐洲各國同歸於盡之時局、要亦吾人之責也、（議員皆歡呼）、（二十一日路透電）各黨議員相繼發言、對於擴充軍備計劃、咸皆避不加以批評、甚至有主張擴大範圍者、若干議員雖謂、現行外交政策未盡妥善、但對於張伯倫首相關於英法兩國保有聯帶關係一層所作聲明、一致表示贊同、保守黨議員邱吉爾·亞米里·自由黨議員曼德、並要求政府發出聲明、謂歐洲大陸發生戰事時、英國卽當派遣遠征軍、前往該處、</p>

<h3>日軍進犯海南島　英法美受莫大影響　香港經濟先遭打擊</h3>
<p>香港通訊、日軍於本月十日淸晨四時、派兵在海南島登陸、已紀前報、惟日軍此舉、關係於國際者極大、茲復紀所聞如次、</p>
<p>海南島爲中國南部之唯一大島、面積約十萬餘方里、人口約四百萬、其中百分之七十爲漢人、百分之三十爲當地土人、（即黎人）漢人均居於沿海各地、黎人則居深山中、其中一部份已與漢人同化、一部份則依然在原始生活狀態中、度其耕種狩獵生活、全島氣候溫和、冬季亦無絲毫寒風、蓋其地處熱帶、又有海風爲其調節、故終年和煦、不熱亦不悶也、中爲五指山、其最高峰拔海五千尺、南部山嶺重疊、北部則較平坦、且因北部與雷州半島僅夾一海峽、有海輪來往其間、故商業繁盛、經濟文化、比較發展、南部及中部、因交通阻隔、一切均異常落後、該島物產頗豐、旣有漁鹽之利、復有天賦鑛藏、而木材·椰子·檳榔·橡樹·咖啡等、所產亦極豐富、若與南洋相較、並無遜色、該島四周、尙有形勢天然之深水港口多個、如臨高港·淸瀾港·馬裊港·楡林港等、旣可作爲商港、亦可作爲軍港、是以日本之覬覦該島、固不始於今日也、惟該島地位、旣爲英國遠東航路之唯一通路、復爲法國安甫之前面屛障、因此日本雖欲染指、亦不可得、日軍進攻華南後、英法兩國（允其是法國）即表示决不許日軍佔領瓊崖、初不料時至今日、日軍竟不顧英法之抗議、毅然派兵登陸也、而日軍今日之敢於進攻瓊崖、其原因當於歐洲局勢中找尋、簡括言之、目前法國因西班牙政府軍之失利、在軍事上已受制於義德、英國以老成持重、處處退議、日本爲義德盟友、乘機進攻瓊崖、英法雖受威脅、究亦莫可如何、故海南島戰局之展開、與英法美諸國、均有莫大影響、日軍之所爲、實有促使太平洋上風雲緊張之可能也、</p>
<p>香港與海南島、相距頗近、經濟關係、亦極密切、因瓊崖各種物產之出口、十九均運來香港、而瓊崖全島數百萬人每日所需之各項日用工業品、亦由香港運入供給、同時香港人烟稠密、糧食蔬菜之來自瓊崖者、亦復不、少、故港瓊貿易、向極發達、自廣州失陷後、香港貿易、即一落千丈、洋貨存於堆棧、不能運入內地、內地土產、雖求過於供、終亦無可奈何、惟瓊崖一處、則相互貿易如故、今該島亦發生戰事、香港商業、當又受一打擊、而旅居香港之瓊崖人士、均以經營進出口商務爲生、目前夏歷年關適屆、戰事爆發、預定裝配之貨物、均不能如期配去、尙未結束之賬務、亦不能結束、損失之大、實難數計、而瓊崖猪牛蔬　之中止運港、亦將使香港糧食、發生恐慌、</p>

<h3>僞方奴化滬市敎育　强授日文删除體操課游擊隊員焚燬僞校舍</h3>
<p>上海僞「市政府敎靑局」成立後、對於奴化敎育、仍根據已往僞「大道市政府社會局」之計劃、在市區內强迫施行、惟學生人數極少、且屢受某方之無理干涉、學生苦不敢言、浦東游擊隊、並於廢曆元旦、擊毀僞「大道第十六小學」校舍、茲誌各情如次、</p>

<p>奴化課本迫授日文</p>
<p>各僞校之敎職員、大部均係拆字相面之流、學識不甚充分者、因絞有學識者、俱不願喪心病在、做此工作、所用課本係由僞「敎育部」所編、內容根據各書局原出版之敎科書、將其中關於革命·黨國旗·烈士·等有民族思想之文字、完全摘去、闡揚其所謂「王道」謬論、各校中總理遺像巳一律改懸孔子遺像、並强迫敎授日文、對於體操一課業已删除、可證其用心在使中國人身體不必鍜練也、</p>

<h3>上海敎育界　改革敎育意見　改進我國師範敎育的意見（下）</h3>
<p>— 吳增芥</p>
<p>訂定師範生訓練的標準關於師範生德性的修養、過去各校因環境不同、所定的辦法、自不一致、以後應由敎育部訂定訓練目標和條目、使師範學校的訓育、有所適從、敎育部在釐訂這項標準之前、要廣徵師範學校當局和小學敎育專家的意見、並分析優良小學敎師應有的品格、更參照小學公民訓練標準、師範訓練的最大目的、是要使學生做兒童的表率、因爲小學敎師的行爲性格、對於兒童的影饗很大、學校的訓育間接的誘導重於直接的敎學、因之、「人格感化」、高於一切、敎師要能以身作則、潛移默化、師範生自己如果有了修養、才可成爲優良的小學敎師、</p>
<p>適合小畢的實際需要師範學校的課程、應適合於小學的需要、小學所不需要的、可以刪除、現行師範學校課程標準、是吾適合小學需要、還是一個問題、舉一個例說、師範學校的生物、理化一類科目的敎材、都是從學科本身着眼、未能顧及小學的課程內容、師範生往往以未有小學需用的敎材而感到敎學上的困難、今後師範課程、應根據小學課程標準、加以修訂、以期適合小學的實際需要、使師範生有做小學敎師的充分標準</p>
<p>上舉四端、係個人對於師範敎育的改進意見、是吾有當、還望專家們加以討論和指正、</p>

<h3>蔣委員長的衣</h3>
<p>— 水鳥</p>
<p>在這二十世紀的年代，一個領袖的服飾，自不比從前封建時代的多須裝璜。這在蔣委員長一身是最能表現出這二十世紀的風度的。他平常穿的都是中山裝，中裝，簡便的軍裝；很少看見他穿着西裝，我只看過他在新婚照相時，有穿過西裝的一回。和服的打扮，似乎是他在日本留學的靑年時代。在前年全國童子軍大檢閱的時候，蔣委員長第一次穿上特級上將的禮服，這要算他最輝煌的服飾了。在平時，他的衣着是極其平民化的。當其在書室中讀書時，夏季每御其破舊的夏布長衫；冬季則御一舊絲棉袍。他最歡喜的衣服顏色，是鼻烟色一類；所用衣料，以淸潔爲主，絕對摒棄舶來品，而以國貨土產爲尙。有一次，馬國亮君和他的一個朋友到一家裁縫舖裏去，無意中在桌子上看見一件白麻布衣料，旁邊小布條寫着「蔣委員長來衣料一件」幾個字；附量身度一張。這發現引起他的好奇，店夥告訴他說：他們這衣店原設在南京，南京失陷後，遷移到漢口。蔣氏的衣服向由他們縫製的。他並且說：「蔣委員長普通穿的衣服，從來沒有一套是超過四十元以上的。」這種樸素生活，求之於現今世界各國領袖中，也是很少見的。同時，比之我們國內有些人一雙襪子或鞋子，便得化上二三十元的事情，允爲難能可貴！</p>
<h3>一九三九年春季時裝設計</h3>
<p>— 蒼奇</p>
<h3>置衣須知</h3>
<p>— 煥鈞</p>
<p>裁製一件衣服、預防日後衣料的縮短，必先落水後纔做，這是指布的來請。備使是絲毛織品須得保持顏色的鮮明美觀，就不能落水，只好噴水。普通的人往往拿噴水一種工作，也交給裁縫去做；可是裁縫們大都要揩油衣料，如噴水一縮，就沒有多餘了。所以交裁縫去噴水，十九是靠不住的，還是辦一隻噴水壺，自己來噴，那就妥當放心了。</p>
<p>一件很講究的新袍子，穿到後來，別的不打緊，總是一條領頭先弄汚，現在的靑年，頭髮梳得長長的，油光烏黑的，領口允其容易汚損，二十來元一件衣服，穿了不多幾會，顏色倒仍很鮮明，而爲了領頭失去美觀，不是很可惜的麽？（領頭上的油汚就是洗衣店也難洗掉他，而且一洗之後，顏色終不及原來鮮明）所以我添置一件衣服，必定盼咐裁縫，多裁一條領頭藏着，將來先前的一條汚損之後，再換一條新的上去，不是依舊很美觀而整潔麽？</p>
<h3>絨線旗袍</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>時代的輪子，不絕地進展着，物質享受的新貢獻，亦日新月異而歲不同！毛絨綫織物的風行，有數十年悠久的歷史，盛行始終不衰。近年來，中西毛絨綫出品，爭奇鬥勝，或以色美質軟見優或以絞頭見長，而編織的種類和式樣，亦翻陳出新變化無窮。初僅手套，鞋，襪，背心，衫褲，幾種很簡單的織品，目前則披肩，外套，馬甲，圍巾，童帽等類，一經女子靈巧的心計，與　手玉指的朝乾夕惕，便成一襲很新颕，很輕巧的出品了。絨綫的柔順，美麗，正象徵着女子的柔順，美麗，絨綫是閨秀和娘兒們的甜蜜伴侶，此話不錯。</p>
<p>麗琳編結社主任，沈琳女士爲余言，伊有一件一九三九年新的貢歡—絨綫旗袍；於絨綫馬甲之外，罩上一襲絨綫旗袍，正如出水芙　，益增　媚了。何况輕暖如裘，式樣又新奇。伊又說，女子膚色，與肥瘦，人各不同，苟配以顏色相稱的「絨綫旗袍」，自更別具風韻了。（筆者按麗琳社址在愚圍路一○四四號）</p>
<h3>李紅的新裝</h3>
<h3>隔色毛綫刺綉短袖新裝</h3>
<p>— 馮秋萍</p>
<p>這件新裝，編法很簡單，用三種顏色相配編成，全身配白色，再綉上黑花，穿在電影明星李紅小姐身上更見淸潔美觀。茲試述編法於左：</p>
<p>材料；細毛綫白色六支，黑色一支，銀灰錢一支。</p>
<p>用具；單頭針一付，雙頭針一付，毛綫刺綉針一隻。</p>
<p>起首針數，前後身共計二百十六針，先用黑色綫結邊一寸闊，再用白色綫結二行，再隔一行黑色，後隔六行白色，再隔一行黑色，多結一針上一針下，以後前後身全幅編法，多爲半針，但前身兩面之邊，十針，永遠編一針上一針下，結有八寸長，分開前後身，開掛肩，將中央之一百零四針作後身，以此一百零四針不放不收，結有五寸半長剩下。</p>
<p>右襟編法：爲五十六針，邊十針，仍舊爲上下針，掛肩處，與後身相同，離領圈尙有二寸，先開領圈，一行上，先挑去十針，後隔一行收一針，隔一行收一針，共收十二針，左襟亦然。</p>
<p>袖口編法：用四枚棒針挑起，針數共計一百零八針，先以銀灰色綫結八行，上下針，再用黑色隔一行，後用白色綫編四行，用黑色結一行，白色編一行，邊用黑色綫編六行用上下針收口，收之即成，另一雙相同。</p>
<p>領　挑法：用二枚棒針挑起，針數共計一百二十一針，先用銀灰色，結八行，隔一行黑色，四行白色，一行黑色，二行白色，邊用黑色編八行，用收口法收之即成。用二粒梅花鈕，以兩邊之領翻下，用鈕子釘上，即成一件旣新式又美麗的小翻領短外衣了，倘使你歡喜的話，再用毛綫刺綉法，在衣襟角上，綉上幾朶花，會更顯得美觀。圖中李紅小姐穿的，就是這件短袖新外裝，好看嗎？</p>
<h3>怎樣保存衣服</h3>
<p>— 謝天申</p>
<p>衣服是人類保障身體的工具，對於容貌，禮儀，衛生各方面，都有密切的關係。我們穿着衣服，必須以淸潔美觀爲標準。因爲要保持淸潔和美觀，必須隨時注意。衣服除了洗滌以外，允須保存衣服，使其質料和花色，可以久用而不損壤，此非但是主婦的一項重要職務，而是人人必須應得的智識的。</p>
<p>衣服久穿的重要原因，一是質料堅實，顏色不退减，縫紉精細。二是保存適當。</p>
<p>衣服如一染有垢膩，當即洗滌，使其淸潔。襯杉和襪寢具等須時常洗滌，因爲這些衣具的垢膩，不是由他物浸染，是由於汗與灰塵所構成的。這些垢膩，如經久不洗滌，則在垢處起了霉點，因霉點含有水分，對衣服的質料是非常容易損壞，顏色因之而退减也有，故保存衣服，非勤於洗滌不可</p>
<p>將穿着後的衣服脫掉，可掛在烈日光下曝晒。因衣服吸收空氣的水分和人體上的濕氣，在烈日曝晒後，水氣亦隨之淸散，使可乾燥不致發霉。不常穿着的衣服，每年應須擇乾燥的時日，取出曝晒。毛織品及皮衣，允應時時取出曝晒。曝晒最適宜在秋天，春冬季亦可，夏季空氣含有多量水分，容易傳濕。鮮麗的衣服，直接在烈日下曝晒，容易使顏色退减，這是應該注意。</p>
<p>在衣箱或櫥中，應放置樟腦末或丸。其功効可保持乾燥，且免蛀蟲侵入。藏衣箱櫥，宜用價値昂貴，品質精良的最好，因爲能防止濕氣的侵入。桐木箱最能抵禦濕氣，因爲一遇潮濕，木便會膨脹起來，濕氣很難侵入。故桐木製的箱櫉，藏衣是最好的。如果預防生蟲，可以用樟腦油或花椒煎汁塗抹在縫隙中，可免除生蟲之患。</p>
<p>藏衣的箱櫥，應該置放在乾燥的地方，如家宅在樓下居住，必須用木架或枕木墊起，使其不受濕氣。</p>
<p>凡收藏的衣服，必須洗滌乾凈。如有不便洗滌的衣服，可用氣油Gasoline洗滌，然後曝晒。凡是貴重的衣服，可用包袱或皮紙包紮，然後再收藏。</p>
<h3>服裝趣語</h3>
<p>— 不問</p>
<p>住在上海的人對於服裝是有相當考究的，這是甚麽道理？只可把一句俗諺來表示一下：佛靠我裝，人靠衣裝，只重衣衫不重人！</p>
<p>身上穿着四兩頭，家裏煨着火石榴。上海人考究服裝，所以成衣舖，比烟紙還要多。但是上海的成衣舖，向來不用「上海」二字來號召的，却拿「蘇廣」二字，作爲獨一無二的商標。一位初到上海朋友，到處見了「蘇廣成衣舖」的招牌，不禁驚奇道：「怎麽？蘇廣成衣的營業，眞發達？竟有如是多的分店？」其實，上海開埠以後，蘇廣兩地的人，來者最多。廣帮別有風格，所以另有廣帮裁縫，佔着地位，其他如寗紹人，也不在少數。但是衣服和蘇帮差不多，所以蘇帮裁縫，也佔了極普遍的勢力。當時只有廣帮裁縫，可與蘇帮分道揚鑣，後來因爲這種歷史關係，所有上海的成衣舖，非加「蘇廣」二字，就够不上號召的資格。</p>
<p>蘇帮栽縫，在上海早年，很有相當勢力，因爲時常別出心裁，想出花樣，前來供獻考究服裝的主顧。有幾個被社會注目的人，穿了新花樣的服裝，出來兜一個風，那就你仿我傚，一時蔚成風氣，誇爲風頭之健；西諺有云：「好裝飾者，裁縫匠之玩物也，」好似也在譏笑上海的風氣。從前聽說那時婦女的服裝，要算妓家最爲新奇，所以伊們握着服裝的權威，規規矩矩的婦女們，醉心時髦，毫不以魚目混珠爲恥，情情願願，和伊們裝成一般模樣，方可符合出風頭的條件。到了後來，妓家思想，遂漸落伍，不能隨着時代之輪，日新月異地前進，同時，就有許多社交名媛，影星舞女，出而代執服裝的權威，因爲伊們的衣服，摹仿歐美，寓健康於嬝娜，式樣翻新，不落陳套，莫云日新月異之可羨，且有朝紅暮綠之可分，遂成婦女服裝最摩登之典型，從此奠定了「時裝」的基礎，於是「時裝」公司，應運而起。所謂「時裝」，完全是歐美化的風格，不是蘇帮廣帮，所能操縱，因此，蘇廣成衣的勢力，幾有一蹶不振之槪。幸而有幾個聰明的「蘇廣」裁縫，錫力採求歐化，改換新法，就把一張尺寸單，加以改良，上擺中擺下擺，分成好幾個階段，量起尺寸來，一分五釐，都不敢馬虎，所以直到現在，「蘇廣」成衣舖的命運，還可苟延殘喘地下去。但是新婚的禮服，宴會跳舞游泳等等服裝，以及外套大衣，則非光顧時裝公司不可，「蘇廣」成衣舖對此只可望洋興嘆了！</p>
<p>衣食住三者，爲人生所必需，而「衣」居其首，可見衣服對於人生的重要性，實在駕乎飮食居住之上。古稱搢紳爲「衣冠」，衣冠簪纓，都是仕宦的衣服，所以華胄又稱「衣簪」，歐陽修所云「衣被羣生，贍足萬類，」乃指仁義普及天下之意。僧家師弟相承，統稱「衣缽」；小說上描寫閨閣動態，多有「衣香鬢影」的辭句；富貴不歸故鄕，就有「衣錦夜行」的幾諷；這是封建思想的遺毒，切莫傳染。俗稱兄弟如手足，夫妻如衣服，」衣服可以常換新鮮，所以夫妻亦可常鬧離婚，可見我國傳統的思想，早已默認夫妻離婚的可能性。但是深願今後的夫妻們，切勿再以「衣服」來整喩夫婦之道，否則，並不是傳染默化，却是上了古人的大當了。</p>
<p>孟子曰：「雖袒裼裸裎於我側，爾焉能浼我哉？意思就是露臂露身，都是非禮的舉動，也不能汚穢及於孟子，袒，是捲袖露臂，裼，是捲袖露裘，裸，是赤裸裸。裎，是赤身裸體，目下婦女時裝，兩袖截掉，幾露其腋，此猶不足爲奇。舞塲中竟用草裙睡衣，作爲吸引的號召，這種階段，實在更比袒，裼，裸，裎，來得激底，所以麻醉衆生，刺戰透頂，無怪一般舞客，之趨若驚了。</p>

<p>上海難民救濟協會育组　勸募難民生產教育經費特刋</p>
<h3>難民生產及敎育之重要性</h3>
<p>— 倪逢梅</p>
<p>本市各界對於難民救濟工作之推行，誠可謂不遺餘力矣。始而大量收容，以衣以食，繼而厲行節的，休戚與共，終而推動生產及敎育，由消極而積極，繼摧殘破壞以後，而進行建設補救，使人力物力，不再有一點一滴之浪費，以期增强國家於無形，不可謂非吾人艱苦歷程中一大進步也。</p>
<p>往日吾人之所謂救濟難民，大抵出諸慈善性質之捐助，其目的亦止於救濟而已，主其事者，亦被視或自視爲功德無量而已。但今日之所謂救濟難民，其性質絕異，於是國境之內，何以忽有如許難民，吾人首當認識其造成之原因，而後方知吾人之救濟被難同胞，不僅基於人道主義之一念，其間更有重大之因素存焉。惟其如此則被難同胞，雖賴救濟而得生存，然亦當使其如何方有利於國家民族，不以徒活爲已足也。</p>
<p>因此吾人之於難民，第一，有使其生產之必要。今日一般意見，以爲難民除救濟外，殊無良法以善其後。所謂生產云者，亦恐有名無實，得不償失，或又以爲救濟難民，已達年餘，何以早不計及？兼之本市工商生產機械，受盡推毀舶來物品，供給維難，將何以着手推動以收圓滿之效果乎？吾人於此非不知其工作之鉅大艱苦，然改造時勢，戰勝環境，正係今日每一國民所宜身體力行。盤根錯節，方見利器，故吾人乘此時會，正可運用羣策羣力，以實行有錢出錢，有力出力之原則，而奠定民生日用永久自給自足之基確。如機械摧毀，則吾國向極發達之手工業，正可起而代替，如洋貨昂貴，供應不繼，則士貨正可大量生產，以承其乏，安見難民之不能生產，而生產計劃之不克實踐乎？抑有進者，吾人致力於難民之生產，於愛惜物力，開發經濟而外，更要使其勞動筋骨，鍜鍊身體，齊一意志，爲生存奮鬥之預備，蓋處此洪流激盪之大時代中，决不容有飽食終日，無所用心之一羣國民也。</p>
<p>第二，有使其敎育之必要。我國文盲，舉世無匹，以故敎育之在我國，愈見格外重要。敎育難民，一方爲掃除文盲，一方更負有養成健全公民的責任，我國今日，正在集中一切人力物力，以求最後之生存，難民生產，係動員物力之一部分，敎育難民，爲使曉然於此項建國之意義，而知效忠於國家，最低限度，如國家所訂之社敎新目標，必使其全部明瞭。吾人應知在難民生活中敎育出來的良好公民，更有重大意義，更有敎育價値，吾人更應知敎育與生產，有聯帶關係，難民生產，以敎育方法去推動，允能收事半功倍之效也。、</p>
<p>今者本市敎育界，已率爲難民生產及敎育募集基金，吾知此一運動，必能打動絕大多數人之同情。雖成功有資乎衆力，而倡導必自於本身，風動草偃，有開必克，吾願全市敎育界師生，銳然自任，速底於成。</p>
<h3>廢歷新年與募捐</h3>
<p>廢歷新年是快樂日子，百工休業，大家尋些快樂，爲了尋快樂，化的錢自然較平時爲多。老子說：「天之道，其猶張弓歟」，張而不弛，人生便覺苦痛，一張一弛，足以恢復疲勞的精神，爲身體著想，爲事業著想，都是應當的。現在雖是大難當前，哀鴻遍野，但是苦中作樂，卽所以增加奮鬥精神，延長奮鬥時間，新年尋快樂，也未可厚非。</p>
<p>可是非常時期，容與太平盛世不同，一味尋快樂，未免有些頽廢嫌疑，眞正愛國的人，當然不願出此。最好一面尋快樂，一面不忘當前的大難，從具體的說來，就是要提出一部分的娛樂費，移作救難之用。享樂不忘救難，這呌做樂而不淫，救難不忘享樂，這呌做哀而不傷，樂而不淫，就是義，哀而不傷，就是勇，義勇兼備，這不是人生最好的態度嗎？」推行難民敎育，增加難民生產，是我上海人義不容辭的救難天職，在此廢歷新年，大家節省些娛樂費，做成這件好事，「民吾同胞」的精神，完全用行動來表現，這是多少有意義有價値的舉動，就個人論，借此表示人生的態度，就整個上海綸，借此表示大國民的風度，節省一些新年娛樂費，收穫這兩大效果，大家只要用冷靜的腦筋，細細的想一想，誰都樂於贊成罷了</p>
<p>至於上海敎育界及各校靑年，大家認爲思想比較前進，允該利用廢歷新年，節省娛樂費，移作難民敎育與生產之用，用行動來喚起社會的同情，把我不救難民，誰來救難民的話，造成上海全市極濃厚的空氣，這樣的敎育界和靑年，才配稱前進的敎育界前進的靑年！</p>
<p>爲勸募難民敎育生產經費告社會人士書</p>
<p>本市難民救濟恊會成立後，承社會人土共存己飢己溺之熱忱，互寄解衣推食之同情，使流浪本市之十餘萬難民，得無凍餒之虞，良用欽佩。惟此項消極工作，雖已獲相當成績，而敎育生產等積極工作則猶未展開，敎育界文化界最近乃有難民敎育生產經費勸募運動之發起。查本市各收容所難民數中計成人的六萬餘，兒童的三萬餘，在昔均爲自給之國民，今遭戰事受盡苦難，苟全於收容所中，旣少敎育機會，又乏生產技能，長此以往，徒爲消費者與文盲影響所及，何堪設想？敎育界文化界同人，心爲不忍，惄焉憂之，愛本羣策羣力之原則，共圖有錢出錢之義舉，發起勸募敎育生產經費運動，目標暫定爲十萬元。深望各學校及社會人土一致奮起，互楫推動，俾難民敎育生產之計劃，早觀厥成，而使難民兒童，不致失學，難民成人有生產技能足以自給。凡認募一元者，由難民救濟恊會贈以爲最善最樂紀念章一枚並另訂獎勵辦法，凡學校及學生認募成續優良者，再由本會題詞獎勵，以揚仁風。惟此項運動，擬以最短促之時間獲最滿意之成續，以最經濟之方法，達最良好之收穫。是以意想所及不得不向社會人士奉吿者，的有下列數端。此項運動正在農曆新年發動，民間習俗，恒有宴客拜年之舉，學生界卽可乘機將糖果費壓歲錢之所得，捐爲難民生產敎育經費，於個人旣節省無謂之浪舉，於社會則可舉辦有效之事業，因利乘便，善莫大焉。至向外界或公共塲所勸募，則爲本會所不取，蓋不僅影響學課抑亦有關租界之秩序，與學生之安全，此應向社會人士聲明者一也。本會此次勸募，純以隨綠樂助爲宗旨，蓋社會人士，旣貧富不一，受學子弟之經濟情形，亦當然有所不同，是以一學校學生所能認捐者，究應多少，絕不勉强，所望人人胞與爲懷，量力捐輸，俾得集腋成裘，以竟全功，此應向社會人士聲明者二也。最後尙欲向敎育界續進一言，卽本市敎育界，過去對於難民救濟事業之推動，雖嘗爲之努力，惟有一小部份未能盡力，以致社會輿論，微有失望。蓋敎育界爲社會之先導，社會屬望甚殷，按之常情實不應有此憾事。今旣有難民敎育生產經費之總動員，甚望敎育界人士亟起直追，奠定不墮之榮譽，成績如何，卽爲我敎育界熱忱於慈善事業之試金石，果能全體參加，則我整個敎育界卽可昭示於社會，使我整個敎育界，免受意外之責言，此又應向社會人士聲明者三也。今者勸募運動，行將發動，敢以一掬之誠，切望社會人士予以熱烈之同情，使此十萬餘難民於給養無虞之餘，尙有生產敎育之機會，則幸甚矣。</p>

<h3>日方爲恐怖事件　昨提書面抗議　於昨日下午送達工部局租界警力充沛無可非議</h3>
<p>本埠滬西一帶、因華界雜色人等之出沒無定、以致持械槍殺人命案件、迭有發生、公共租界當局、雖具有確保租界治安之警衛力量、惟以滬西越界築路毘近華界、以致對於此種案件、因限於華界方面、在事實上未能恊力防範、迄難予以完全肅淸、但公共租界警務當局、則仍秉以往精神、在界內盡力設法維護治安、</p>
<p>藉口陳案張有其詞</p>
<p>自僞「維新政府外長」陳籙被殺後、日本方面、多方張大其詞、東京與上海日方人員發爲種種强硬論調、以遏制所謂「恐怖」案件爲名、惟陳籙之被殺、行刺者係出入於華界、日方爲欲達其久蓄之願望計、乃由駐滬領事三浦向租界當局提出其「抗議」之事、</p>
<p>日方昨提書面抗議</p>
<p>據現代社云、租界內連續發生槍殺案件後、日總陌事三浦、曾二次往訪工部局總董樊克令、諉責租界警力單薄、不足維持治安、復於昨日下午三時、向工部局提出書面抗議、其內容措詞、外間無從確知、據聞日方認爲過去迭次發生之槍殺案件、租界警務當局、實未盡力防範、及採餒厲之措置、故應負其責任、此外並提出二項保留、　要求大量增加日籍警員人數、俾日方能充分與警務當局合作、以維護治安秩序、　日方武裝軍隊、於必要時、有權在租界區域內直接行動、聞此項書面抗議、係經東京上海兩方面會商後所發出、工部局之態度如何、决於考慮後、再予答覆、或擬先行報告領事團、取决一切、</p>
<p>另悉、工部局對於此事、亦相當加以注視、昨日下午、高級員司於私人間曾略有提及、聞此殆係其職務上之關心耳、</p>
<p>內容複雜無新發現</p>
<p>字林報云、日大使館發言人昨夜（二十一日）接待新聞記者時、某記者問日總領事三浦因星期日公共租界發生之暴舉、向工部局總董樊克令提出之抗議、日當局已吾接覆、發言人答稱、三浦曾與樊氏會談、但此種案件、內容複雜、目前渠不願討論之、此事刻正在研究中云、又問日當局是吾擬在公共租界內取軍事行動、發言入答稱、渠對此點、目前不能有所奉吿、發言人又詳述陳籙遇害情形、謂調查所得、於報載之外、未有新發現、工部局警務處關於此案、已拘獲數人、且正與日憲兵合作、</p>
<p>租界警力十分充足</p>
<p>又據現代社所得外人消息、租界當局、自於滬戰後、維持治安、全力以赴、成績堪稱最佳、警務力量、至爲雄厚、如華籍警員、約有四千餘名、西籍·日籍·印捕·警員、共有二千餘名、其總數共爲六千數百人、足以應付一切事變而有餘、再加萬國商團二千餘名、包括ABC三大聯隊、機關槍隊·防空隊·白俄團丁隊等、一遇事變、卽可全體出動、此外復有英美防軍從事恊助、故租界當局維持治安之努力、實無可以訾議之處、而一般漢奸、及日僞人物、因不堪內地游擊隊之襲擊、紛向租界匿居、尤足證明內地防範、遠不及租界之認眞週密、日方此次諉責租界維護不力、實爲其企圖施以壓力之藉口、聞租界當局决秉以往之精神、努力維護治安、不容日方非議也、</p>

<h3>日艦一艘被擊傷　海門登陸失敗　日竟封鎖椒江妨害航行海門有砲戰及日機偵察</h3>
<p>日艦自於二月十八日起砲轟浙東之海門、企圖登陸、爲駐軍勇猛擊退後、日艦竟將海門之椒江封鎖、並派機偵察浙東各地、海門沿江大火巳撲滅、日艦一艘爲擊傷、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>大火撲滅</p>
<p>日艦集中浙東海門之台州　後、連日砲轟海門、砲彈均落北岸荒地、我方並無損失、惟海門水警辦公處、會中一砲彈、幸無死傷、日機連日飛往浙東各地偵察、未投彈、海門沿江自二十日起大火業已撲滅、毀去房屋數百間、聞係漢奸放火、目的響應日軍登陸、幸經我方勇猛之選擊、日軍終不得逞、日方計劃完全失敗、</p>

<h3>要增進夫妻之愛　須速消滅腎虧體弱部</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>腎虧症之影響及於夫婦愛情者，實已鐵律如山，無可吾認。但看離婚案件中，特別關於丈夫之不能盡其生殖責任一點，女的一方，每振振有辭，理由充足。由此可知腎虧影響家庭的和平及自身幸福之重大</p>
<p>講到腎虧形成的原因，以老年人爲最多，這是生理的關係，由於中樞的興奮性减却而來，要是年輕的人，除却房事過度或自凟的遂情，致發生腎虧外，平素吸煙飮酒過度的人，中樞也爲着麻醉，减退它的作用，久而久之，一定要發生腎虧。</p>
<p>此外因身體過弱，或是糖嚴病和腎臟炎等病症，也足减退其勃起機能，又凡脂肪過度症，脊髓癆等，也能消失他的生殖作用，其他一切疾病，因着身體衰弱，性慾也一定跟着减退。</p>
<p>至於因房事過度和自凟斷傷而起的腎虧，呌「性的神經衰弱症」，因着神經衰弱而起的腎虧，連射精中樞也失却效用，這呌做「麻痺性腎虧」，有了這種毛病，婚後性生活時非常痛苦。</p>
<p>上述的幾種腎虧，確爲患者的終身桎梏，但從各國名醫實地試騐的結果，証明上述各症，唯有用內分泌劑可以治愈。其他療法祗可作爲輔助而已，名醫如（ChixsostomM.D.Drhunter）氏科學大家如Dr.Ploled博士等，彙集全世界各種內分泌劑加以化騐與動物試騐，結果証明德國生理學家梅倫博士所發明之雄壯動物靑春腺「即睪丸全部」素製劑男用「補體康」最富有功效。余在俄國時，曾將「補體康」之成分。作數十次的化騐，証明其所含之動物畢丸以猩猩爲主，故其功效遠勝於同樣製劑，常服之後，確能返老還童，共女用補體康有調經種子之功。</p>
<h3>遺精過頻應積極挽救</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>遺精過頻之後，就是表示其精關已弛鬆不堪，同時其主宰性慾的靑春腺亦因精液之不斷流洩，致失却其繁榮，還有在發育尙未充分時，即犯上自凟而遺精，而致發育不全，生殖器短小，至於腦神經的衰弱，允與遺精有密切關係，蓋其自凟一次，所消耗血液甚鉅。久之，其新陳代謝的機能减退，則失眠，健忘，精神不振，頭腦脹痛，心悸，盜汗，耳鳴，面色蒼白，四肢酸軟等症逐接踵而至矣。</p>
<p>遺精患者如陷於上述各種病象，不僅對康健有極大影響，而其一生幸福誠亦不堪設想矣！故應積極治療，方可挽救，依最進步治法，爲服以「耐而斯遺精片」該片功效神速允能永久根治遺精，若已釀成上述種種衰弱症象，則應兼服畢丸精質製劑「補體康」以培補虧損，自能澈底治愈。</p>

<h3>各國最新堅强軍備</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>不能不歸功於淋病特效藥的發明</p>
<p>世界大戰的危機，日益接近，巳迫在眉睫，各國海陸空軍，都圍鎖在堅張的空氣中，爲了要防止戰時軍士們精力之衰頽，而招致失敗起見，于是在戰前各國軍事當局，特派檢查的專任醫師，個別給軍士們施行嚴格的檢驗，經詳細檢查了之後，發見在他們之中，占百分之七八十左右，皆有花柳病，而花柳病中又以淋病爲特多。對於這個晋遍的病症，在治療方面，確實感到異樣的困難，然而歐洲畢竟是科學的發源地，淋病的療法，早就超過水準綫上，所有各國醫師，都規定醫士門採取最新的科學方法，那就是彼德博士所發明之蛋白體黃色素混合製劑「克淋濃」作爲內服劑，經試用結果，急性淋大都在三四瓶左右，完全可以根治。慢性淋如攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，膀胱炎，關節炎等，都能在短時期內，全部斷根，騐血證明根治。</p>
<p>據巴黎的大學名敎授美頂哥夫氏之實騐，他會用人猿施以淋毒的人工傳染，即見其兩畢丸腫大，以他種淋藥餵之，病反增，惟以「克淋儂」拌合食物餵哺，通常僅四五星期，即可全治。因此淋病患者爭相購服，太多收效至確。此外他國妓館爲防止淋病滋曼，妓女類多進服大量「克淋　」，她們從前有政府設立的「洗凈所」裹面的科學設備甚多，就是問柳尋花者於事先雙方行使藥水洗滌，以免彼此傳染，但自「克淋儂」，一藥發明之後，淋病已劇激减少，而不必用此麻煩之手續矣。此實爲淋病學上一大發明。宜乎各國應微壯丁，及常備士兵體格自强，多合標準。</p>

<h3>攝護腺炎之新治療</h3>
<p>初起的特徵</p>
<p>攝護腺炎之初起，其特徵爲肛門前方之深部，感覺疼痛，而尿意頻數，且尿量甚少。及至排尿將完時，莖部復感刺痛，若以指揷入肛門，乃起壓痛，此因攝護腺腫大，故呈此過敏現象也。於此種塲合，醫師必須施行攝護腺之冷却肛門坐藥，及內服特效藥「克淋儂」，一方注射藥劑等最新療法，則一般醫家所望而却步之攝護腺炎、即可應手取效。夫攝護腺炎一症，不但痛楚難受，即在生殖前途，亦感有無窮之遺害。其故攝護腺能分泌出一種液體，此液體稱之爲攝護腺液，具有涵養精虫之要素。一如魚之與水然。魚失水即不能生存，精虫而無攝護腺炎，斷無生殖之能力。故患淋毒性攝護腺炎者，不可不於此等地方注意及之。</p>
<p>騐案的示例</p>
<p>茲將余所治騐之例舉出如下。患者爲陸姓男子；因作狹邪遊，於第四日覺排尿疼痛，包皮浮腫，尿道部有膿汁狀液汁流出，來余處求治，搖頭蹙額，痛苦萬狀，蓋攝護腺腫脹，尿道閉塞，以手按之，濁流甚多，斷爲急性尿道炎及併發攝護腺炎，於是先用注射血淸，並用冷罨及肛門坐藥，同時服用「克淋儂」，俾其發生抗淋噬菌作用，及德國靜電療法，如此可免炎症分泌物壅塞尿道，而促炎症之消散，治療約不日左右炎症完全消退，痛苦亦失，續行治療三星期檢查之確已根治矣。但陸君如不早治，必由慢性而不可挽救矣。診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診廿號，每號僅取號金五角</p>
<h3>肺病宜早省悟</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>大都數的肺病患者，時起一二聲之輕欬，或有劇烈之咳嗽喀，食慾減退，精神萎頓，想重乃日就減輕，於是癆損之症遂成矣。若能在此際予以切實之治療，即可望其根治，且收效亦易，倘延至重篤之二三兩期，則非有長久之時期，不能治愈。故肺病息者應宜早治療爲要，然要適合治癆之內服劑，木亦難事，此爲余臨床二十年來恒所感到者。惟自德國徙梅博士發明「補肺拿爾」使得豁然而解。蓋「補肺拿爾」之藥效，有滅除肺病酸素之功，而使肺病菌失去其活動之力，欽癆症喀血，咳嗽咯痰，胸痛盜汗及潮熱，服之無不霍然</p>

<h3>意兵槍傷工人案　意領館予撫卹　撫恤費二百元</h3>
<p>工人陳培淸、宜興人、於上月十一日淸晨、在小沙渡路藥水弄口、遭意駐兵無故槍擊、重傷腿部、事後其家屬報吿宜興旅滬同鄕會、請求援助救濟、該會據報、派員調查事實眞相、即致函意領館及工部局交涉、現悉工部局何副總辦德奎·華董江一平二君、出而斡旋交涉、巳得意領館給予陳培淸撫恤費二百元作爲了案云、</p>

<h3>上海西區　毒品瀰漫可怖　由日軍特務部大量供給吸取收入支付軍事消耗　上海已開始墮落步驟</h3>
<p>字林報云、上海西區、罪行與暗殺猖獗、其中更惡毒之威脅、厥爲雅片、該區華人、有悉數墮落之虞、得日當局之允許與援助、雅片乃運往該區中公開營業之土行、工部局雖會提抗議、西區租界馬路之外籍居民、亦嘖有煩言、但界外當局、對此不加睬理、仍</p>
<p>迅速推行　其計劃、今日該區之情况、僅能以「可怖」一辭形容之矣、毒物貿易遠勝於他種最嚴重之威脅、凡日方統治之地、雜片與他種毒物、均可合法出售、而在上海亦已開始墮落之步驟、當局則向土行征收款項、而獲鉅利、據調查所得、追溯至去年一月間即有在西區成立土行之企圖、但此等計劃、至十一月杪始實現、設立土行十一家、其正式</p>
<p>開設土行　之延遲原因、乃日方欲土行主先繳「儲金」每季三千元、雖土行主無力繳付、而至今日、西區土行之巳知者多至三十四所、無不獲利豐厚、預料日後繼起設立者、尙有多所、因此種貿易、土行主與日方均可大獲利益也、土行主須向當地統治者、每月繳納一千元、旋因爲數過鉅、乃减爲五百元、始得營業、此等雅片、乃由日軍特務部自虹口方面</p>
<p>大量運往　而供給土行者、去年十二月中旬、白利南路有土行公會成立、土行主均人該會爲會員、該會旋遷往極司非而路、當局向公會會員獲得鉅額收入、而用以支付軍事消耗、因此彼等拒不將該區之土行移交「維新政府」統制、除土行與賭窟外、上月間勞勃生路四七七號檳榔路轉角設有虛設太昌（譯音）烟兌店字號之海洛因</p>
<p>私運中心　地、其經營者似爲韓人三名、由西區中流氓若干爲售毒經手人、本年一月間、日方當局在極司非而區成立「防止私運雅片團」、由「上海市府」日本顧問某氏主持、設辦事處於凱納路六十一弄二十一號、該團分兩部、其一辦理日韓人私運案件、另一部辦理與華人有關之案件、該團經費、乃每月向土行</p>
<p>所收款項　中撥出、固不待言也、去年歲暮、復有「禁烟總局」成立、設辦事處於百老滙大厦六樓、志在蘇浙皖三省內實行雅片專買計劃、此一團體之詳細行動、尙無所知、但其成立、意在搜括款項、用以支付軍事消耗、似無疑義也、去年八月初、决定在滬西成立「雅片專賣局」、故擬租賃康腦脫路五三八弄第六、七、與七十號房屋三所、作爲貯存大景雅片之棧房、但據所知、此提議之「局」、尙未開始辦事、</p>

<p>各地抗爭禁糧出口</p>

<p>被扣米船已獲釋放</p>
<p>據米業界消息、廢曆年底、被日海軍將停泊滸浦口之米船七艘扣留後、本埠新豐等米行、一再交涉、業已釋放、所有被日艦開槍死傷之船員三人、其善後辦法、由行方籌資撫恤家屬、及担任醫藥費了事、</p>
<p>米業市場明日開市</p>
<p>本市米業市塲、以總結束期已過休假期滿、定於明日上午九時恢復開市、行客成交了割等情、槪照前定條例實行、至米糧成交行佣原規定每石一角二分、惟同業因兜攬競爭、致參差不一、故本市豆米業公會特重申前議、統一行佣每石一角二分、如有任意降收、一經查出、即行處罰、</p>

<h3>呢帽工業的未來</h3>
<p>呢帽工業、在中國還只不過有十餘年的歷史、雖則在十餘年前、呢帽已成社會的必需品、而那時國人經營呢帽工業者、尙付闕如、因此市上所流行的、無一不是舶來品呢帽、那時意商的義興寶克、以及魯鱗美最時等行、每年輸入呢帽、爲數實在不少、</p>
<p>及至民國十餘年、始有國人創設帽廠、那便是華幅製帽廠、該廠創設時、因鑒於製帽工程複雜、兼之經騐缺乏、故初時僅能由帽胚（註）製成呢帽發售、後以出品尙佳、兼國人愛國心長、樂用國貨、加之售價較廉、故莫不樂爲購用、因之外貨在中國市塲漸次發生動搖、該廠又進一步研究帽胚製法、不數年果有所成就、能由羊毛製胚、然後由胚製成呢帽、不復假手於外人、</p>
<p>經該廠數年之奮門、國人設立帽廠者漸增、就滬地論在戰前約達念餘家之數、如華福·中華·華與·華生·許惟記·中央·利華等、所惜除華福華生利華三家外、其餘各廠、祇能用帽胚製成呢帽、華福等三家雖能裂胚、除自給外、亦不足供同業需求、故帽胚仍須仰給於外來、近數年來、閃數量出品日增、兼質料亦尙可與舶來品相抗衡、故外貨呢帽、幾已絕跡於中國市塲、不料八一三的砲火摧殘、滬地各呢帽廠、十九多設在虹口和南市區、因之戰端一起、廠址都淪爲戰區、而設於租界者、僅中華華興等三數家而已、至去歲九十月呢帽上令之際、因各客帮大量採購、存貨行將告罄、一方面則因出品缺乏、供不需求、斯時各廠商因鑒於呢帽倘再無大量出品、則整個呢帽業、勢將瀕於絕境、一部份廠商乃設法恢復營業、復工雖易、而帽胚則難、於無可奈伺中、斯時適有日商三井洋行尙屯積大量帽胚、其數約達十萬打之鉅、而各廠商於一籌莫展中、紙得向伊採購、不數月如此鉅大數量、亦竟所剩無幾、而數百萬法幣、同時落入日人手中、故名義上爲國貨、實際則爲日貨了、</p>
<p>呢帽工業的過去雖巳如上述、而將來趨警極堪注意、因最大的帽胚問題、如無法解决、則十餘年來慘淡經營的呢帽工業、勢將漸次踏上毀滅之途、海上不乏明達工商、宜速設立純粹製胚廠、或大規模裂帽廠於內地、或上海、以救當前之急、（章榆梅）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「勞而無功」</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>昨天，英國孟却斯德指導報的評論中日戰事，可以說洞中肯繁，確鑒無比。他說，日軍在第一期戰爭中，雖有所勝利，而按之實際，却是「勞而無功」，因爲他們的「兵士皆疲勞沮喪，長官亦昏亂失措。」又說，「遊擊運動，今後將益蔓延，日方將無法遏止之。」於是他預言一年之後，日軍必將求和。</p>
<p>不過該報論及中國兵可與日兵匹敵，而中國軍官則較遜於日軍官這一點，我們不能不加以一些補充的意見。我們都知道，「千軍易得，一將難求」，軍官本來比了士兵難於造就。過去我們沒有存心要去侵略人家，又因爲自己內爭不已，以致現代知識的軍官，造就得不够，是無可諱言的。有些外國軍事觀察甚至說中國高級軍官中，足以當師長之任的，只有胡宗南，湯恩伯，薛岳，孫連仲四人，雖未免持論太高，有失實際價值，而中國軍官的未能盡如人意，就又得了一個旁證。但這種缺陷，我們除了加速度的造就現代知識的軍官以外，還另有抵補的所在：第一，我們應用遊擊戰；第二，我們應用持久戰。</p>
<p>遊擊戰是天羅地網，任憑日軍官的軍事知識何等優越，到此惟有「昏亂失措」，不知所可。持久戰是長期的消耗，任憑日軍官有什麼驚人的知識，在時光老人的裁判下，將完全失去他們的效用，無所施其技。此外，他們人才的消耗，將與日俱减，而我們人才的養成，則將與日俱增，雙方的人才，不久就會有相當的比例，已爲不易的趨勢，而我們超出他們，也正是意料中事。因此，我們目前在這一方面的缺陷，我認爲毫不足懼。</p>
<p>孟却斯德指導報大槪也料到這一着的吧，所以他雖舉出了中國方面這一個缺陷，而仍舊爲中國方面作了樂觀的預言。因爲日方在戰塲上的戰略是精良的，而我方在戰塲以外的戰策，遊擊戰與持久戰，就可以　單一切，使之黯然無顏色，這是舉世一致公認的事實。</p>
<p>在第一期戰爭中，日方是「勞而無功」。我以爲僅僅「無功」，還是他們的幸運，此後，我可以斷言，只要我們根據旣定的方針，作堅强的抵抗，那他們不但要「無功」，更將會「有過」，我們瞧着吧！</p>
<h3>李廣世號飛將軍</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>前幾年故馬廉所發現的「雨窗欹枕集」裏有一篇「李廣世號飛將軍」，差不多完全根據史記卷一百九「李將軍列傳」和前漢書卷五十四「李廣蘇建傳」。這的確是很好的悲劇性的故事。李廣防禦匈奴，數奇，屢次無功；即使有功，也只能將功折罪。他隨周亞夫平了吳楚，因爲不當背將軍印，不曾得賞；他大敗匈奴於沙溪，因爲觀戰的中貴被匈奴射死，又算是他的罪，只能功罪相抵；他在雁門擊匈奴，爲匈奴所得，雖曾逃出，却又被朝廷貶爲庶人：以上都是漢史中所有的。</p>
<p>小說爲了要强調其悲劇性，於是再替李廣增加了兩層波折。李廣受　陵尉的屈辱，夜行被拘，復官時便斬了　陵尉。漢書上說是先斬後奏，漢帝嘉許，並錄有詔令的原文；小說却說李廣大敗匈奴，「帝欲加官，　陵尉家人詣闕告廣起　　報，無非斬尉，帝怒，將功折罪，再爲閑人。」這是其一。漢書上只說「廣軍自當，亡賞。」意思是說，李廣「爲虜所勝，又能勝虜，功過相當。」但小說上却說他「乘左賢王車，意圖不仁，下廷尉問罪」結果張騫說情，又是「將功折罪，廢爲庶人。」這是其二。</p>
<p>最後就是史漢上所說的李廣隨衛靑霍去病出擊匈奴，迷路失期，自刎而死。</p>
<p>正史上四次「數奇」，小說則增爲六次。這使我想起薛仁貴征東演義，薛仁貴功爲張士貴所奪，屈居火頭軍，也是悲劇性的，使讀者爲之憤惋，爲之不平，更增加了同情心。我又想起俞大猷，他曾屢勝倭寇，都被趙文華把功勞搶去，反要將他問罪。最有名的便是岳飛被秦檜害死在風波亭。</p>
<p>但是，現今却不需要這種悲劇性的故事；因爲現今是政治淸明軍紀嚴肅的時代，賞罰分明。只要看韓復榘和王　南的槍斃，汪精衛的開除黨籍以及閻海文姚子靑的紀念等等，都可以看出全國團結一致，共同　侮，李廣岳飛俞大猷的寃抑將不復見於今世了。因此，我們現在以歷史的題材來寫作章同小說或皮黃劇，應該採取積極性的題材，如「江頭碧血」之類。田漢在「抗戰與戲劇」中也曾表示過同樣的意見，並會在上海救亡戲劇座談會上有過同樣的表示。</p>
<h3>諷刺藝術在日本的展開</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>就人類的文化史看，人性的流露於文藝方面，無疑是首先表現於音樂與繪畫。在造型藝術的石器時代和銅器時代出現以前，在野蠻人間已經有了最基本的音樂和最輪廓式的繪畫，這徵之於普通的人類歷史或考古學史，都是不移的事實。</p>
<p>人類的所以不同於其他動物，照唯物論的經濟史觀言，是人類的能製造並運用生產工具。這完全是正確的觀點。但在現象上，人類和別的動物的最顯著相異處，還是人類的擁有呌做『文化』的這一東西，這是人間物質與精神的綜合的結晶。</p>
<p>一切動物都有感情，但除人類以外，別的動物的感情流露，决不能離開其所屬的生理條件以外：馬的交頸，狗的互舐，都可說是他們的感情流露，感情表現。可是人類在這種生理的感情表現以外，更能利用第三者的物，來表現出非直接生理所能解釋的感情，一切藝術的產生，我們認爲就肇因於此。</p>
<p>這物和精神結晶品的藝術，用個象徵的譬喻，就是火神帕羅米修士（Promethus）偷到人間來的火。這火一旦到了人間，它就永遠不熄。那怕在人類歷史上野蠻時代和黑暗時代交互迭現，但藝術這件東西，却始終循着曲綫形在發展。而諷刺藝術的產生，就在這曲綫發展的弧形階段。</p>
<p>譬如拿現在的日本情形來說，在軍人的淫威之下，日本的一切文化運動可說已全部陷於停頓。文化運動本是到達正義的一支支流，而正義這件東西，在今日的日本『國策』之下，有如水火之不相容。所有從事正當文化活動的人，不是遭虐殺，就是被投入獄中。因此最近甚至發生了大學教授缺貨的怪現象。他們所稱的『銃後文人』，好聽些是幫閒，老實說則就無異隨軍閥幫兇的一羣走狗。這並非是惡意的謾駡，他們的『文章』就是一個鐵證。</p>
<p>但正唯帕羅米修士的火種已移到了人間，所以火勢雖有一時的稍殺，但火種究竟不能熄滅。所以法西斯蒂的軍閥雖對文化各分野的活動大施壓迫，但在日本的文學上，也曾出現過石川達三的『未死的兵』那樣作品。現在石川達三雖已表示『悔改』（如一月號『中央公論』上所載的『武漢會戰』就是一例），可是民間諷刺藝術的活動，却極見活躍。尤其是針對所謂『國民總動員運動』的種種卡通畫，竟能逃過檢查員的注意，登載在流行最廣的日本報紙和雜誌上。就中有幾張卡通，我們只要看一看標題，就會感到怎樣的充滿了諷刺性。譬如關於『節約』（這和中國提倡的節約，意義不同），就有『點火同盟』，『吸烟集團』，及『垃圾國軍』等，關於代用品，就有『代用議員』，『指甲鋼筆』，關於民間經濟動員，就有『衣櫃再編成』，『三忌日』，『實行家庭例』，『時間消費稅』等。（關於原圖，『雜誌』三卷五其六期——後者十六號出版的翻製版）。</p>
<p>日本的國土上雖植遍了軍事法西斯的槍林，但這種諷刺藝術，就是一枝在槍林中茁生的蔓藤，它們最初的力量雖極微弱，但一旦蔓延成長，它們就會圍住槍林，終於把這座槍林絆倒，爲正義的文化運動廓淸一條成長發展的路。</p>
<p>報載德國的戈倍爾已注意到諷刺藝術的將危害到法西斯的存在，故决定予以撲滅。但我們堅信糜非時特的魔力，畢竟是無能消除帕羅米修士的火炬的。結果一定是飛蛾撲火，自速其死而已。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>『諸位父老伯叔兄弟姊妹，我現在報告你們一個很不幸的消息，新近戰局形勢發生了重大的變化……我們這一支軍隊，因爲守土抗戰，不願撤退，所以和後方失去聯絡，變成了孤軍，現在我們這一團還有一千多人，並不完全駐紥在這裏，大部份的給養要靠地方上供給，這是很對不起的事。可是代你們着想，出了少數費用，免得匪徒乘機竊發，便能照常安居樂業，似乎也很合算。我一定嚴厲約束部下，不許擾害你們，並且盡力幫你們的忙，務求做到軍民打成一片的地步。』</p>
<p>大家聽了葉團長的話，充分透露着歡迎的情緒。陳鎭長首先起來發言，表示同意。</p>
<p>葉團長見大家這樣，便和陳鎭長及地方上有名有紳董們商量辦法，結果决定給養一項，由商會負担十分之六，民眾負担十分之四，至於駐紥地點，除了公私廟宇祠堂以外，並由各大戶人家自動讓出前進房屋來，葉團長自己家裏也如此辦理。</p>
<p>一切都商議妥當了，葉團長才下令把隊伍開到鎭上來，民眾事先早已知道，所以絲毫都不驚惶，甚至還有燃放爆竹的。兵士們就在爆竹聲中，整齊嚴肅的通過了市街，他們雖然經過了久戰，可是氣槪還是很雄壯。</p>
<p>這在合浦鎭上眞是個新紀元，因爲這裏並非軍略要地，所以從來就沒有駐過這許多兵。起初民眾和兵士還不免有些隔膜，後來彼此就像一家人一樣，感情一天比一天親密起來了。</p>
<p>葉團長一刻都沒有忽略了軍事上的佈置。他的司令部就設在鄉公所裏，當在前綫担任掩護的那一營也陸續撤退下來時，他就依照事實上的需要，把部隊重新編製了一下，分成六個游擊大隊，每大隊轄三中隊。大隊長就由他自己和梁團附朱參謀以及其他三個營長担任，中隊長則由連排長依次遞升。鎭上除留下兩大隊一中隊外，其餘都配置在附近各村鎭裏。步哨直放到鐵路公路綫左近。爲了預防敵人抄襲後路起見，更統制沿湖所有的船隻，凡屬民航船，一律不准開出，只許漁船在附近打魚，採辦物品。</p>
<p>除此以外，葉團長開始在部隊裏成立了政治訓練班，就呌他弟弟方英和地方上的幾個知識靑年主持，第一步先從喚醒民眾入手，用文字，圖畫，戲劇，在本鎭和附近各村鎭宣傳。同時更把原來的軍醫處搬大爲救護班，他妹妹方慧，和醫生金楚南，都應徵參加救護工作，不過藥品的來源非常缺乏，棉花雖有，藥棉和繃布却很少，這實在是無可奈何的事。</p>
<p>鎭上的民眾並沒有因軍隊的到來影響了他們的日常生活，但最使他們發愁的，是收割下來的稻，完全無法出售，只好擱在家裏。這在葉團長倒覺得非常合理，他屢次對大家說明積穀的重要。</p>
<p>陳鎭長對葉團長一切調度佈置，非常心折，常常在家人面前誇贊葉團長怎樣英俊，怎樣有爲。他很想把他的女兒秀月許配給葉團長，不過不便自己開口。他曾託圖董楊岳梁去探葉老先生的意思，葉老先生倒似乎很贊成，誰知葉團長却一口拒絕了，理由很簡單，僅僅只有八個字：「匈奴未滅，何以家爲！」（一八）</p>

<h3>新艷秋蒙難經過</h3>
<p>— 余余</p>
<p>昨日本刊載「新艷秋爲國犧牲」新聞一則，係路透社北平二十日電，謂數星期前吉祥戲院圖刺繆斌未果，當塲斃一關徵林，新艷秋遂遭日憲兵逮捕，瘐死獄中云云，原電略而不詳，新艷秋以一弱女子，而能作此壯舉，志誠可嘉。旬日前，記者有友自北平返申度歲，爲愚談及此事，則與路透電所載，略有出入，今繼徐慕雲先生之後，錄之以告關心新艷秋事件者。</p>
<p>馮治安南下　新伶留平暫住</p>
<p>當七七蘆溝橋事變未發之前一月，新伶曾正式嫁宋哲元部下之馮治安，宋馮皆抗日名將，迨平津相繼淪陷，馮以携眷不便，遂將新艷秋全眷，託江朝宗代爲照應，已則隻身南下，仍繼續其抗敵工作。旋江朝宗爲北平「維持會會長」，與日人往還甚勤，新艷秋亦爲日人某高級軍官所垂涎，欲娶之，經江之諫阻，未成事實。事後新則深居簡出，亦不登臺歌唱，中間，日方曾數度邀新艷秋赴「滿洲國」演劇，皆爲江所勸止。惟日方某高級軍官，對新艷秋之欲娶未遂，心中不無悻悻然也。</p>
<p>刺繆斌未中　新伶不幸入獄</p>
<p>本月六日，北平有盛大義務戲一臺，梨園中人，迫於環境，不能不參加，戲券亦係各藝員承銷，在吉祥戲院演出，新艷秋與李洪春等演大軸，劇目爲「全部貂蟬」。不料在貂蟬一劇未上之前，池座中槍聲忽起，發生狙擊案，死者僅一人，（殆即路透社所傳之關徵林）而死者傍座者即「臨時政府」要員繆斌也。索死者身伴，得戲券，察其號碼，係新艷秋所承銷者，繆斌亦即飛奔離院，斯時劇塲入於混亂狀態之中，移時，貂蟬上塲，觀客已去其十之三四，迨劇終，新伶劇裝未卸，已爲日憲兵捕去。</p>
<p>艷秋救出樊籠　但已遍體鱗傷</p>
<p>翌日，江朝宗即向日方高級軍官說項，請求釋放新艷秋，同時，日又派人至新艷秋寓所搜查（即江朝宗宅），得書一封，係馮治安於一月二十二日自××發者，幸所述皆問安語，不生疑寶，卒由江朝宗以某某兩機關及十三家北平著名舖保，始將新艷秋救出樊籠，但已遍體鱗傷。據談，至憲兵司令部後，即被卸去衣飾，成裸狀，以鞭鞭之，幾無一言以自解。新艷秋旣返江宅，憤不欲生，擬仰藥死，由江妾小金花阻止，同時，繆斌亦至江寓慰問，新伶對繆，瞪目以視，立即暈厥，乃車送協和醫院云。</p>
<p>蒙難有三因　並非瘐死獄中</p>
<p>統觀吾友所述，可知新艷秋之遭此奇辱，其因有三：一爲拒赴「滿洲國」演劇，二爲拒日方某高級軍官之婚事；三爲繆斌對艷秋，平日亦作染指想，（外傳新艷秋爲繆之外室，其起因殆在此），至於馮治安之一封書信，此不過題外文章而已，而路透電之謂新艷秋已瘐死獄中，可證其不確，蓋吾友離平之日，正艷秋返江宅之時。即使艷秋云亡，亦不瘐在獄中，定死在協和醫院無疑也。</p>
<p>新艷秋爲吾師林屋山人義女，歷次南下，與愚及陳蝶衣兄最友善，看雲樓主人曹靖陶君，捧之甚力，曾訂嫁娶暹羅，卒以事未果，靖陶得此消息，其痛心當較愚與蝶衣爲甚，惟愚則謹以一瓣馨香，冀路透電訊之不確耳。</p>
<h3>新型舞踊劇「罌粟花」的演出使人十分興奮</h3>
<p>— 拾得</p>
<p>「上海劇藝社」在這春節中演出了三個獨幕劇：「羅莎麗，」「啞妻」和一個新型舞踊劇「罌粟花。」前面兩個是法國戲，是對一般「紳士風度」和「因噎廢食」的人們的諷刺。我因爲到塲太遲，沒有完全看到，所以，這里衹想談談最後一個戲。</p>
<p>「罌粟花」是吳曉邦原作，陳歌年作曲，中法劇藝學校贊助演出的，自己對於音樂和舞踊都是門外漢，中國舞台上之有舞踊劇這次是否創舉，恕我淺陋，無從「考證；」但是吳曉邦的個人舞踊却看過幾次，以外行的眼光看來，舞踊着重在力的表演。他的「傀儡」迄今還深深地印在我的腦膜上。而「罌粟花」是更顯示了集體力量底堅强，不可侮！</p>
<p>大上海淪陷以後，滬郊四周幾乎完全籠罩着毒物的氣象，這種毒化政策是敵人的整個陰謀底一部分，在我們「風夕雨朝，盼望不休，歷盡辛勤，爲愛好自由，靠着和平，靠着豐收，幾千年來穿吃不愁」的美麗的大地上，他們拔去了「我們撒下的麥的種，稻的種，高梁的種，大荳的種。」實施毒物的播種。在我們的記憶中，天津的「浮屍案」是决不會輕易消淡的！而現在又在散佈「新秩序，」「復興會」的糖衣政策了。但是，「我們應當不辭辛苦折磨，沒有安眠我們也得振作，」這二十個月的血肉以赴，是足够粉碎敵人的幻夢了。這是集體的力量！自由之光卽將照臨大地，在枯萎了的罌粟花周圍，慶祝我們的勝利！</p>
<p>吳曉邦先生能針對着這問題，爲我們編製了這「罌粟花」舞踊劇，這直是春節中的喜訊。至於演出成績如何，那因爲我是外行，衹得說一點外行話</p>
<p>「罌粟花」「共分五塲。第一場的「汗濕背胸，我們耕土」及第五塲的「爲了愛和生命，種下愛的花果，」或許是排練時間太忽促，感到舞步和音樂不能密切的配合起來。在第一塲表示快樂的時候還可以，第五塲却不够顯示力的威武和美麗。第三塲「愛在人間永生」該是最優秀的一塲了，音樂和舞步都能表演出「愛在心中沸騰，我們顯爲愛犧牲」的精神。第二塲的愛好者和經營者，我似乎又看到了「傀儡」的影子，但印象還欠强烈。罌粟花，其兄，及幫兇者三個人物的動作比較簡單，頗能狀出「墨衫」「　」和「左右做媚眼」的三位一體的狼狽爲奸。</p>
<p>這次雖然排練時間太怱促；但是中法劇藝學校成立不久，能有這樣的成績，已是使人高興的了。希望他們繼續努力，我們竭誠地等候着第二次的演出。</p>

<h3>與李之華先生談談關於「楚霸王」</h3>
<p>— （王次龍）</p>
<p>昨天報上披露的那篇李之華先生的「楚霸王」大作，我看了之後，又非常仔細的研究一番，覺李先生的情意十分感格人心，不過李先生或者也是惑於一時衝動，沒有把「楚霸王」的本事詳細地分析一下，致有幾段近乎神經過敏了我因爲李先生特別提起我在「藝華畫報」上所寫的幾句話，故而我不能不抽暇來跟李先生談談，同時，糾正李先生一點點錯誤。</p>
<p>問題是李先生把我二句「主戰窮兵黷武，主和而仁義和平」的話竟拆了開來，另外裝了題目來大發宏論，李先生旣知道「仁者昌，霸者亡」，這原是不易的至理，那末，霸王的濫殺無辜，用新的眼光來看，不論誰都明白，李先生這一點宣揚義務尚不能負，偏偏還要硬拉上岳飛秦檜來自炫其詞，李先生在落筆之前，應該對於歷史上認淸楚一點，霸王是屬於西楚，主戰窮兵黷武，劉邦是大漢，主和而仁義和平，這是國與國的鬥爭，它决不能和岳飛秦檜相提並論，要知道岳飛秦檜是同朝人物，與項羽劉邦的兩國紛爭是極端不合，仁義和平，這是我們中國幾千年來的美德，進一步說到目前，决不如李先生所寫單單一個「戰」字，在「戰」字上面還有一個「抗」字在着，否則，我們不但喪失了祖先的美德，更且連友邦所給予的深切底同情，也會付之汪洋了，李先生不以正大的目光來着筆，僅以一己的見解——錯誤的見解橫加議論，倒反而自造成爲侵略者的尾巴，這却是很危險！</p>
<p>幸虧歷史上是有那麼楚漢相爭的事，又幸虧我編導時完全根據西漢而沒有什麼變更，否則，不僅要被李先生笑爲畫蛇添足，更要被李先生加以禍國罪名了，這豈非寃枉，加之以罪，不悲無詞，但我總相信李先生是一片丹心，决非蓄意，不然，我倒可以從此告休，實在這個年頭兒，寃枉事情太多了！</p>
<h3>元旦曲叙瑣記</h3>
<p>— （籌成）</p>
<p>戲曲研究會，以本月十九日，係農歷已卯元旦，目逢星期日，爲難遇之佳節，故事前通告會員，舉行第三屆出期曲叙。爲增進興趣起見，規定各會員是日所詠劇目，須非平日所唱角色例如向唱旦者，須改唱淨丑等角色，向唱老生者，須改唱旦角小生等，恍如反串。予於下午四時前往，周文同與其夫人徐慧珠女士，正在唱小宴，周飾唐明皇，徐唱楊貴妃，聲音嘹亮，咬字準確，伉儷之樂，勝於畫眉，無怪周邦俊夫人在旁側耳靜聽，笑逐顏開矣。繼由樂天主人紅豆館主人體貌魁梧，且　拳衛，飾魯智僧；紅豆館主鶴髪童顏，長髯垂胸，飾老和尚；王介安君籍隷吳門，滿口蘇白，飾賣酒者，可稱天然湊合，不可多得。其他如沈恒一溥西園二君之見娘，朱堯文君反唱關公，樂天主人反唱關平之訓子，李夢騶夫人夏恂如女士反唱彈詞，彭志敏君反唱磨斧等，均甚動聽。繼起者有紅豆館主之思凡，白髪老翁，表演靑春女尼，聲音如出谷雛鶯，身段若臨風楊柳，確是難能可貴。顧傳玠君之亭會，張傳芳君之刺虎，可稱爐火純靑，足微斵輪老手。臧子彬君之掃花，說白咬字一絲不茍，準確異常，淸客中不可多得者也。配以紅豆館主之可仙姑，相得益彰，散會時已鐘鳴十下矣。</p>
<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一一一）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>天雷報一捧雪都是劇中人自編的戲</p>
<p>「天雷報」本是漢班裏生角與老旦合演的作工劇，後來被皮黃班攘奪了去，現在却成爲譚派的名劇了。老譚原先演這齣戲時，本由周長順去張婆，周是當時著名的作工老旦，所以演來很有精彩。長順故後，譚氏環顧老旦行中沒有那一個可以承乏他這個缺的，因此才由丑角王長林反串劇中的張婆子，號稱譚氏傳人的余叔岩同今日鬚生行的馬連良也都時常貼演是劇；而老旦一角也全是用的王拴子。其實余馬的「天雷報」，皆係長林所援，當然以此老最爲合適，而且演時有相得益彰之妙。</p>
<p>這齣戲的意義，本來含有神道設教的成分，它在民間的普及性，是與那齣程　派名劇「硃痕記」同樣的深入婦孺腦海之中。不過「天雷報」和「硃痕記」的戲名，還不如「雷打張繼保」同「牧羊卷」的名氣來得普遍，因爲鄉下人對於文字眼不大懂得，所以他們只能記得淺近一些的戲名，並且都曉得這是表演一男一女被雷殛死的故實。因此凡爲父母的倘遇着不孝順的兒子，或某村裏出了一個不賢慧的婦人時，他們總會拿着逆子張繼保和朱春登的嬸婆來說事的。（拿某人說事即以某人作譬喻的意思）</p>
<p>據我聽一位老顧曲家說，張繼保這人不但是不曾被雷殛死，而且相反的他是一個很孝順的人，很淸廉的官。試想世界上那有如此喪盡天良的人，他自幼被張老收去，老夫妻倆打着草鞋，研着小磨，好容易才把這小子扶養了十幾年，後來被他生母認去，不久中了狀元，行經靑風亭時，他的義父義母求他收養，他不但翻臉不認帳。還逼死他的恩母，只賞了他義父二百銅錢。</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Invading Hainan Island Repeatedly Faced Strong Resistance from Chinese Garrison Forces; Japanese Troops Continuously Reinforced Their Fierce Attacks, Suffering Heavy Casualties; Fighting Continues in Areas Surrounding Meiting and Chengmai; Tense Situation in Southern Guangdong, Fierce Fighting Erupts in the Dongjiang Area</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) At present, the defensive positions on each battlefield are increasingly solidified, and the training and replenishment of troops are proceeding diligently according to established plans. Japanese troops invading Hainan Island have encountered strong resistance from Chinese forces, suffering considerable casualties. They have repeatedly reinforced their fierce attacks in a desperate attempt to seize the entire island, but Chinese forces are launching counterattacks from multiple directions. (Special dispatch from 10:00 PM on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Guilin: According to a telegram from Commander Wang on Hainan Island, Japanese mechanized units have been repeatedly repelled by Chinese forces in their attempts to launch guerrilla attacks in the Chinese interior. (Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Yingde: Regarding the battle situation on Hainan Island: There have been no recent changes near Jinjiang. There has been artillery fire in the Fushan area. Japanese troops are constructing an airfield between Fu and Hai, seemingly with long-term occupation in mind. Chinese guerrillas are extremely active, killing many Japanese soldiers. (Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military spokesman's statement to reporters today, Chinese forces on Hainan Island withdrew from the cities of Meiting and Chengmai on February 18. Fighting continues in the suburbs of these two locations. It was also stated that Japanese troops, after landing in Sanya in the southern part of the island on February 16, are advancing westward towards Yazhou. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) On the eastern front of Guangdong Province, fierce fighting broke out again on the 20th. Japanese troops are advancing from Zengcheng, Shilong, Baoan, and other locations towards the east. Chinese forces are currently deployed to intercept them. (Express News dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: On the morning of the 20th, Japanese troops advanced from Shengang in Conghua towards the Huada Gangling area. Around noon, they reinforced with over 200 infantry and artillery soldiers. Chinese forces bravely met the attack, fighting until late at night, when Japanese troops collapsed and retreated towards Shengang. (Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Sihui: The situation in the Xijiang area has recently become more relaxed. Chinese and Japanese forces are exchanging fire across the river with no major engagements. The Japanese troops occupying the area around the southwest estuary and Sanshui City consist of only one regiment. (Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to sources here, Japanese warships off Bailongwei in Fangcheng shelled the coast yesterday morning and attempted to land troops, but they were repelled by Chinese garrison forces. Three Japanese warships were spotted yesterday off Liaoyuan in Dianbai County, southern Guangdong, making the situation there tense. (Express News dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Huanglingji and Jinkou Both Recaptured</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman, discussing the battle situation in the Yangtze River area, stated that Chinese forces recaptured Huanglingji, southwest of Hankou on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, and Jinkou on the opposite bank on February 17. The Japanese transportation lines downstream from Hankou are therefore under threat. Chinese forces have also recaptured Yanglousi and Yangloudong along the Yuehan Railway, so railway transportation south of Hankou has also been cut off. (Reuters dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Incident of Japanese Planes Bombing British Territory; Japanese Military Authorities Instruct Japanese Consul in Hong Kong to Apologize to British Authorities in Hong Kong; Prepare to Express Regret and Offer Compensation for Losses; British Government Firmly Believes Japan Has No Strength to Provoke</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the British government protested the bombing of British territory by Japanese aircraft, Japanese military authorities instructed the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong to apologize to the British authorities in Hong Kong. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Japanese Consul-General here, Okazaki, told a Reuters interviewer today that the Japanese military is prepared to express deep regret for yesterday's bombing of British territory by Japanese aircraft, and is willing to compensate for any damage caused by the bombing. Okazaki also stated that the Japanese military has taken appropriate measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidental events. He has notified the British Consul-General in Guangzhou, Belun, of this point. This bombing was extremely unfortunate, but purely a misunderstanding, as the planes that carried out the bombing were attacking Chinese forces traveling near Shenzhen and inadvertently entered Hong Kong territory, where they dropped bombs. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) All sectors of Chinese society here are paying attention to the British attitude towards the Japanese bombing of Shenzhen and within British territory. They believe that this act by the Japanese represents a show of force. Chinese opinion is that this bombing has no military value or necessity, as the Chinese side has stopped using the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to transport supplies and munitions for several months since the fall of Guangzhou, and there is no significant concentration of Chinese troops in the area. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters today that the Counselor of the British Embassy in Japan, Todd, visited the Foreign Ministry last night to lodge an informal protest regarding the bombing of various locations within the Kowloon Leased Territory by Japanese aircraft yesterday morning. Todd told the Foreign Ministry that he would lodge a formal protest as soon as he received instructions from London. The spokesman, in response to questions, said that he understood that the Japanese government had received information about this accidental event, but did not wish to elaborate on the details pending further investigation. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers all carried detailed reports in prominent positions about the bombing of various locations within the Kowloon Leased Territory by Japanese aircraft yesterday. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, sent a telegram to the British Colonial Office yesterday reporting on the incident of Japanese bombers bombing British territory. The content of the telegram has not been officially disclosed, but it is understood that Sir Northcote has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou. At the same time, London has instructed the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to lodge a strong protest in Tokyo. (Haitong News dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Local newspapers report that the Japanese side is considering its response to the protests lodged by the British, French, and American governments regarding Japanese infringement of foreign rights and interests in China. It is said that Japan is currently awaiting the debate in the US Congress on foreign policy, and will base its response on what US policy will be in the future.

<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph reports that it is not yet known what response the Japanese side has given to the protest lodged by the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, regarding the bombing of Hong Kong. The British government is sticking to the belief that Japan currently does not want to overstep and challenge British and American interests in the Far East, and believes that Japan is well aware that it is already struggling to cope in China and fears that the Soviet Union will attack in the spring.

<p>(Huaiyin) On the 7th, Japanese troops from Xuzhou attacked Fengpei in two routes. One force first occupied Fengcheng and advanced northeast, encountering resistance from Dong Yujing, the magistrate of Feng County, who led his troops in resistance. After a day of fierce fighting, they moved to the border between Jiangsu and Shandong. Japanese troops then forced their way into Pei territory. Feng Zigu, the son of Magistrate Feng, led his troops in a fierce battle, holding out for a day and night. The other force attacked north along the Tongpei Highway, engaging in a mixed battle with the Feng unit's regular troops all day.

<h3>Military Service Department Announces Future Policy Directions; Streamlining Conscription Procedures, Emphasizing Propaganda, Conducting Census and Compilation by County, Revising Military Service Laws</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Cheng Zerun, Director of the Military Service Department of the Ministry of Military Administration, recently stated to reporters that the department's future policy directions can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>Simplifying Procedures and Avoiding Complexity: In the past, handling military service involved complex procedures, making it complicated for both those handling military administration and those being conscripted. In the future, we will strive for simplicity, speed, and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Emphasizing Propaganda: China's original political foundation is not yet perfect, and education is underdeveloped, causing great obstacles to military administration. In the future, we will focus on propaganda. Every county magistrate must personally go down to the villages to carry out propaganda work, so that the people understand the meaning of military service, with the aim of smoothly promoting and enthusiastically responding to conscription.</p>
<p>Census and Compilation by County: In the past, the locations for conducting the census and compilation of draftees were inconsistent, causing various inconveniences and sufferings for the conscripts in terms of food, clothing, and shelter. Therefore, in the future, all censuses and compilations will be conducted at the county seat to avoid the suffering of the conscripts and provide various conveniences.</p>
<p>Revising Military Service Laws: We will strive to adapt to the environment and needs. In addition, eliminating malpractices and removing various obstacles are all essential plans. In the future, if personnel handling military service in various parts of the country engage in fraudulent activities, we will resolutely enforce the law to punish them.

The insidiousness and viciousness of the Japanese are alarming. (Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand Refugees</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we spoke of the current state of Shanghai, with its extreme dichotomy of prosperity and decline. What is prosperous? For almost all industrial and commercial sectors, last year was an unprecedentedly bountiful year. What is declining? The number of people exceeds the available jobs, and the number of unemployed is uncountable; prices are soaring, and the number of those whose income cannot cover their expenses is uncountable. And there are ten thousand refugees. Not only can they not cover their expenses, but they also have absolutely no income; not only are they unemployed, but they have also lost their homes, their shelters, their livelihoods, and even their parents, their children, their siblings, husbands or wives; if not for relying on relief, they would have no clothes, no food, no lodging, and even if they received clothes and food, they might not be warm or full. This is the reality of decline. Within a small area, prosperity and decline are as different as heaven and earth; what crime did they commit to become refugees, and why are we so fortunate not to be refugees? If we truly have no sense of kinship or community, can we remain indifferent?</p>
<p>Ten thousand is an enormous number. There are ten thousand rickshaws in Shanghai. Everywhere you look, you see rickshaws, let alone ten times that number. Fortunately, these ten thousand refugees have been accommodated to some extent, so they do not roam the streets; otherwise, we would see groups of refugees everywhere. Just imagine: everywhere, there are ten times more homeless, hungry, and cold men, women, and children than there are rickshaws. How can we bear to witness this with our own eyes, to be heartbroken, unable to sleep or eat in peace? Supposing we can endure anything, there are ten thousand people seeking a livelihood in this small area, seeking clothes when they have none, seeking food when they have none, seeking shelter when they have none, suffering from hunger and cold, exposed to wind and rain, and no one can help them. Who can control them? And there is no way to control them. Then, how can those of us who are fortunate not to be among them wear our clothes in peace, eat our food in peace, live in our tall buildings and mansions in peace, or travel in our luxurious carriages in peace? Wealthy merchants and businessmen will not be able to live in peace, and even small businesses like youtiao shops and dabing stalls will not be able to operate in peace. Just imagine, what kind of scene would this be?</p>
<p>It is precisely because they have been accommodated to some extent that the suffering of the refugees may not be truly felt by the average person. However, why must we see refugees, be close to refugees, in order to truly appreciate their suffering? Just think about your own material and spiritual life for one day, and then imagine what it would be like to be a refugee with absolutely nothing. I cannot believe that you would not be unable to sleep or eat in peace. Let me give a few examples: It is now the Lunar New Year. What is the taste of cakes, fruits, wine, and meat? What is the meaning of making offerings to the gods and ancestors? What is the joy of socializing with relatives and friends? What is the entertainment of gambling games? These are not things that everyone does, or that every family does, or that some people like or disdain to do; however, these tastes, meanings, joys, and entertainments are extremely common, extremely ordinary. Everyone knows and appreciates them, but refugees want to do them but cannot. The morning is the key to the day, and the spring is the key to the year. We are happily welcoming the new year. So, we are getting rid of the old and making new plans, we are striving to be ambitious, and we have all sorts of future aspirations. But refugees have no plan. To resist the war and build the nation, those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength. But refugees are filled with grief and indignation, but have no way to contribute. Who has no soul? If we are like this and refugees are like that, how can we not feel compassion?</p>
<p>Relieving refugees is not the responsibility of exceptional people; all those who are not refugees have an inescapable responsibility, rich and poor alike, each according to their abilities. We must know that the heart of compassion is innate and should not be sacrificed and buried by selfishness and self-interest. Mutual assistance is the foundation of survival. It extends from one's own flesh and blood to one's relatives and friends, and to society and the nation. Without mutual assistance, there will be decline and death. The more mutual assistance there is, the more prosperity there will be. This is not just a moral cause and effect, but also a necessary key to interests, success, and failure. Those who relieve refugees do so both out of compassion and charity, and out of mutual assistance based on the moral and consequential key of success and failure. Charity is a responsibility that arises from natural principles and human feelings, and mutual assistance is a responsibility that sustains human community. Moreover, this so-called responsibility is not difficult or impossible to fulfill. Have you not heard the appeals of relief organizations? A refugee needs only two yuan per month. Thus, if you contribute a thousand yuan, you can support five hundred people for a month; donating one yuan can provide food for one person for half a month; even one or two fen is a way to make a small contribution to a great cause. Then, who among those who are not refugees cannot fulfill their responsibility? Moreover, the refugees suffer from national disaster, and the blame does not lie with them. It is not a case of poverty and lowliness due to sin. Those who are fortunate enough not to be refugees, is it because of their merit and virtue? No, it is due to a combination of luck and circumstances that they have not fallen into distress. If the situation were reversed, we too would be in need of relief. Or, we may not belittle ourselves as having no merit or virtue, and say that only those with merit and virtue are spared from becoming refugees. Then you must know that doing your best to relieve refugees is the merit and virtue of the present.</p>
<h3>The Third Session of the National Political Council: Chairman Chiang's Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) How can we fulfill our responsibility of establishing the foundation of democratic politics? Today, I, Zhongzheng, as a member of the Political Council, would like to encourage each of you to clarify what kind of true democratic politics we want to create in the Republic of China, and what methods and steps we must follow. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen, with his profound knowledge of both Chinese and Western learning, deeply understood the global trends and the domestic situation. Based on his forty years of revolutionary experience, he created the Three Principles of the People, aiming to lead the Chinese nation to prosperity, strength, and happiness. The Premier's ideal for democracy was to implement a more thorough and practical democratic politics than any other country in the world. In the Principle of Democracy, he criticized the theory of natural rights and advocated revolutionary democracy. Secondly, he wanted the people to fully enjoy the four direct rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum. This embodies the Premier's spirit of surpassing others, focusing on the highest and most distant goals. However, the Premier was not just an idealist, but also a revolutionary practitioner. The higher his ideals, the more practical his steps. The Premier believed that only when the people can practice revolutionary principles and fulfill their revolutionary obligations can they be granted preliminary civil rights. He also believed that the people must undergo training in exercising the four rights before they can fully utilize their civil rights. The democratic politics that the Premier wanted to create was without any hypocrisy or coercion. Our people have inherited the bad habits of generations of autocracy, and their intelligence and capabilities are exceptionally weak. The people are scattered and selfish, and there are many obstacles within the country. With such a background, achieving such an ideal naturally requires starting from hard work and approaching things closely, and it cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, the Premier defined the implementation steps for completing the revolutionary work as three periods: military government, tutelage government, and constitutional government. After the establishment of the National Government, following the Premier's teachings, it first sought to initiate tutelage government nationwide, hoping to actively promote the realization of constitutional government and quickly achieve the goal of revolutionary nation-building. Unfortunately, unification was not achieved, and obstacles arose again. For five or six years, a large portion of the country's manpower and financial resources were used for the work of the military government period. After a brief respite, the enemy invaded, deeper and deeper. In order to safeguard national sovereignty and the lives of the people, the government rose up to fight. After nineteen months of hard fighting, the loss of our country's territory and the suffering of the people cannot be measured in miles or numbers. Judging from the current situation, not only is the work of the tutelage government period interrupted and hindered, but the work that should have been done during the military government period must be done all over again. In other words, we must first eliminate the invaders' military force, eliminate the traitors and puppets, and destroy the counter-revolutionary forces that disrupt national security and the nation. Only after the mountains and rivers are restored and the country is cleared can we talk about tutelage government, and then prepare for constitutional government. Therefore, strictly speaking, we are still in the military government period. According to Article 6 of the Outline of National Reconstruction, the work during this period should be: "All systems are subject to the military government. The government, on the one hand, uses military force to remove domestic obstacles, and on the other hand, promotes doctrine to enlighten the hearts of the people throughout the country." However, as mentioned above, the current need of our country and people is to carry out the war of resistance and national construction simultaneously. We must concentrate public opinion, mobilize popular power, and actively prepare for the completion of post-war national construction. At the same time, during the war of resistance, the people's sense of responsibility towards the country and their understanding of the Three Principles of the People must also be improved. Therefore, even during the military government period of eliminating obstacles, tutelage government work must still be carried out simultaneously. In order to quickly complete the great cause of the revolution, we should not only actively promote tutelage government within the scope that does not hinder military government, but also hope that the progress of tutelage government can supplement military government. Therefore, we must understand that before the end of the war of resistance, "military affairs come first," and the fundamental work of military government must be the main focus, while actively carrying out tutelage government work. This understanding is essential, otherwise all work will lose its center of gravity. Because what we want to create is a thorough democratic politics, we must not neglect procedures and steps. At the same time, because our country has been accustomed to autocratic politics for thousands of years, and the people's psychological habits lack the cultivation and training to be involved in politics, there are obstacles ahead in implementing democratic politics, which must be eradicated. All foundations must be solidified, so we must go through revolutionary construction. The Premier, in addition to dividing the revolutionary process into three periods, also warned us painfully: "The revolution of 1911 overthrew the monarchical autocracy of more than four thousand years and the Manchu conquering class of more than two hundred and sixty years within a few months. Its destructive power cannot be said to be insignificant. However, to this day, the implementation of the Three Principles of the People is still far from having a starting point, because after the destruction, there has never been any construction according to a predetermined procedure." Because at that time, most people ignored certain natural procedures and talked extravagantly about democracy, resulting in laws since 1911 being equivalent to empty words, and disasters followed one after another, causing the country's laws to become tools for politicians and warlords to commit evil activities. Not only was democratic politics not realized, but it also created many obstacles and sins for democratic politics. Just like a famous saying of a revolutionary during the French Revolution, "Liberty, liberty, how many sins are committed in your name!" We must now correct this mistake, starting from scratch, and we must establish the entire freedom of our nation and people, so that the nation and people can obtain true freedom. Since the establishment of this Council, our colleagues have been able to sacrifice personal freedom and small-minded prejudices to lay the foundation for true democracy. This is truly the most gratifying thing since the founding of the Republic of China, especially during the war of resistance. I am confident that my colleagues will be able to follow the Premier's teachings even more in the future, advocating that compatriots all over the country work hard during the tutelage government period, advocating for responsible and vigorous action, and preventing the ills of irresponsibility and disregard for facts. We must let the general public know that democratic politics cannot be regarded as a state of lawlessness, no system, and no government. The public opinion on which democratic politics is based must be sound, collective, and able to represent the will of the majority. The freedom granted to the people by democratic politics must be freedom that does not harm public interests or violate national laws. Especially since our country is now in a period of severe foreign aggression, we must educate the people to respect the absolute nature of national laws and power. The government is the trustee of national power, the executor of laws, and the protector of all the people. In order to effectively protect the interests of all the people and the entire nation, those who destroy laws and discipline and destroy the system must be sanctioned according to law. Any sanctions based on law cannot be confused with oppression. No matter what democratic country it is, there are government systems and laws. The systems and laws under democratic politics are especially to be respected by the people, and the destruction by a few is not allowed. We must lay the foundation of democracy in the war of resistance, not only to make the people truly develop their abilities, but also to make the people understand the true meaning of democracy. We political councilors are the leaders of the people, and we must assume the responsibility of education, protect the interests of the country and the interests of all the people, and for acts that destroy national laws and systems and weaken the overall strength of the war of resistance under the pretext of freedom and democracy, we must unanimously exert the authority of fair public opinion and stop them. We must make it clear to the general public that we must implement military government for the war of resistance and tutelage government for nation-building. There can be no hypocrisy or obstacles in this. We must learn from past mistakes and earnestly follow the steps set by the Premier's teachings to lay a permanent and good foundation for true democratic politics. The Premier's lifelong struggle in politics was to realize the Three Principles of the People and return power to the people. However, people who have not been trained can never govern. The Premier encouraged us, the intellectuals and revolutionary comrades, to be the nannies of the masses, to fulfill the responsibilities of teachers and protectors in the position of public servants. This lesson is indeed the only way to succeed in nation-building.</p>
<p>There are two stories in Chinese history that can well illustrate the spirit of tutelage government. One is Yi Yin training Tai Jia, and the other is the Duke of Zhou training King Cheng. Tai Jia was still young when he ascended the throne. Yi Yin earnestly advised him, and later generations compiled it into the Yi Xun chapter. Tai Jia could not listen and indulged in unrighteousness. Yi Yin made him live in the Tong Palace, on the one hand, he managed the government affairs for him, and on the other hand, he tried hard to educate him, not avoiding hardship or resentment. The three chapters of Shang Shu Tai Jia repeated the instruction, how loyal and sincere. Later, Tai Jia repented, and he was fully prepared with the ability to be responsible for administration. Yi Yin returned the government to Tai Jia and retired himself. When he left, he also described the "Xian You Yi De" article on the essentials of governance to instruct Tai Jia. The Duke of Zhou, entrusted by King Wu, assisted King Cheng. At that time, King Cheng was still young. On the one hand, he prevented the rebellion of Wu Geng, and on the other hand, he endured the rumors of Guan Shu and Cai Shu. The Duke of Zhou's situation was extremely difficult, but he worked hard and bore humiliation, enduring countless hardships and pains, and became haggard. He was always single-minded in stabilizing the country and helping King Cheng to establish himself, never shying away from hardship or avoiding responsibility. The four chapters of the Ospreys in the Book of Songs describe the Duke of Zhou's loyal heart in painstakingly training King Cheng. After hundreds of generations, reading it still moves people. Looking at his original book: "Ospreys, ospreys, since you have taken my son, do not destroy my house. Be kind and diligent, and care for your chicks. Before the sky is overcast and rainy, remove that mulberry soil and build up the windows and doors. Now, these common people, who dare to insult me? I work hard with my hands, I gather the reeds and store the rent, and my mouth is sore from speaking, saying that I have no home. My feathers are tattered, my tail is bare, my house is dilapidated, and it is blown by wind and rain, and I cry softly." The last two paragraphs describe the Duke of Zhou's pain and fatigue to the extreme. Although he worked hard, the country was stable. Although his feathers were worn out, his home was still exposed to wind and rain. Inspired by the passion of responsibility, he entrusted it to an urgent lament. This is truly worthy of infinite sympathy and admiration from future generations. Later, the rebellion was put down, and King Cheng was also successfully trained by him. Like Yi Yin, he returned the government to King Cheng. He was still not at ease, and he described another lesson, "Wu Yi," to let King Cheng know that it was difficult for his predecessors to start a business, and they should be diligent and never be lazy. We were born in an unprecedented national crisis, when nation-building has not yet been completed. Reading the Ospreys poem, can we not feel the same as the Duke of Zhou? The Premier's comparison with Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou is our nation's only revolutionary mentor. He had the political revolution of the three periods of military government, tutelage government, and constitutional government. The country wanted to train the people to be mature first, and then return the government to the people. This spirit of dedication and responsibility shines through the ages, how great it is. Yi Yin said in "Xian You Yi De": "It is not that Heaven privately possesses me with Shang, but that Heaven blesses one virtue. It is not that Shang seeks from the common people, but that the people return to one virtue." After our Republic of China overthrew autocracy, there is also a common thing to follow, which is the Premier's Three Principles of the People. At present, the work of our colleagues is to be close to the Premier and to follow the ambitions of Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou, to truly implement the Three Principles of the People, so that compatriots all over the country sincerely "return to one virtue." To implement the Three Principles of the People and establish the positive foundation of democratic politics is that our colleagues in the Political Council must take on this arduous responsibility together. We are the leaders of the people of society, and we must first establish the model of the people, educating and leading the people with loyalty and sincerity, so that they know their responsibilities and understand how to take responsibility. We are Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou, and the masses are Tai Jia and King Cheng. We must regard the masses as the main body of the country, and we must teach them, train them, and finally return the government to them. When they are all established and democratic politics is realized, we must fulfill this mission. We must set an example within and outside the Council, respect laws and regulations, strictly abide by discipline, be loyal, and take responsibility. The ancients said, "If one is upright, one will be followed even without orders," and also said, "Those who teach by example are followed." If we want to be a model for the people, we must practice what we preach, take responsibility, and abide by discipline. When we make speeches, every word and sentence must be responsible to the country and the people. All our actions must abide by national discipline. With this spirit, we can set an example for the people, and the people will naturally accept it. The people we train can then implement true democratic politics. The purpose of the government in convening the Political Council is to have us share responsibility, be Yi Yin, and be the Duke of Zhou. The government hopes that when the military affairs are over, the work of tutelage government will have been completed at the same time. In other words, the day of victory in the war of resistance is the time when the foundation of nation-building is firmly established. The government has such expectations of us, and the people's expectations of us are very high. How should we work hard so that we can live up to them? Whether democratic politics can be established completely depends on us. Whether the nation can be revived is completely up to us. The ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People, the world of great harmony, that is, the outline recorded in the Book of Rites, must be promoted by us political councilors with one heart and unremittingly, so that the people are diligent and develop a spirit of mutual assistance. The Fifth Plenary Session hopes that the whole country will devote itself to strengthening unity, actively struggling, and accelerating the three points of construction. Many proposals from this meeting have made it more concrete, and we political councilors must also actively promote it and take the lead in implementing it, so that the social effect can be promoted and implemented. Our Political Council is not a deliberative body in ordinary times. We are a leading body for resisting aggression, sharing weal and woe, working together, and sharing security and danger. It is not only the expression of public opinion, but also the concentration of popular power. Our political councilors not only sit and talk, but also stand up and act. This spirit of not avoiding difficulties and dangers and not shying away from hard work has already earned great reputation. Now the second stage of the war of resistance has begun, and the success or failure is even more important. After this meeting, all of you will go to various places, and you must take advantage of the common will and resolutions of this session, contribute your sincerity, contribute your abilities, enhance our national spirit, and promote our inherent morality. For the several most important proposals of this conference, such as strengthening the conscription system, implementing spiritual mobilization, promoting economic construction, and rectifying the Baoxia in various places, I hope that all of you will take on the responsibility of advocating and promoting them, and work separately in the places where you are working, and implement them one by one. Not only can the government get a lot of help, but it is also beneficial to the country, the nation, and all compatriots. At the closing of this conference, I look forward to the arduous work in the future, and I am truly overwhelmed by my expectations for the compatriots in various places who are in the same boat through wind and rain. I wish you all work hard together to make the war of resistance victorious and the nation-building successful. (End) (Electric report on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Closing Remarks by Vice-Chairman Zhang and Political Council Member Zhang</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) National Political Council Member Zhang gave a speech at the closing ceremony, the original words are as follows: The opening of the third session of the Political Council is fortunate to have our supreme leader who presides over the war of resistance to the end as the chairman. Colleagues of this Council regard it as the supreme honor. Especially in the difficult period, the soldiers at the front sacrificed their lives in blood, and compatriots all over the country suffered all kinds of trampling and destruction by the enemy. Colleagues of this Council are full of enthusiasm. Often hearing our chairman explain the national policy of the war of resistance will surely win is a good medicine for the people of the whole country. Cowardly psychology is swept away. Colleagues of this Council, after hearing about politics, have conducted long-term research and investigation, and felt that the important proposals in this meeting, such as the amendment to the Conscription Law, the financial and economic plan for the war zone, urging the Provincial and County City Political Council case, the rectification of the people's self-defense in the rear, the adjustment of the administrative organization case, and the development of the border culture case, etc., are more realistic and more concentrated than the previous two sessions. They carefully consider the plans proposed by the government and are not tired of reasonable dialectics, correcting the decadent trend of only A and perfunctory in our country's tradition. They take the war of resistance as higher than everything else and try their best to avoid friction between domestic factions, gradually developing a good atmosphere of solidarity and benefiting without being different, so that the great nation of 450 million people can unite sincerely to resist the brutal enemy's aggression and create world peace. Under the guidance of the supreme leader, colleagues and others secretly take it as their responsibility. Our country's culture of more than 4,000 years is recognized by various countries. Japan has inherited a part of the Tang style and has been baptized by Western civilization. Relying on its military force, it wants to conquer the world with the fallacy of Tokyo's near attack and using Chinese to control Chinese. Our country's war of resistance is not only related to the survival and extinction of our country, but also the axis of success or failure for world justice and humanity. They are violent, we are benevolent, they are fraudulent, we are righteous. The deeper they sink, the stronger our resistance. What they get is a point and a line, what we are fighting for is the area. Looking at the situation in the second phase, it has reached the goal of attrition warfare and protracted warfare. For the guerrilla areas, colleagues yearn for the government to unify power and responsibility, stabilize people's hearts, and supervise and verify the names and reality of the government, so as to live up to the government's grand intention of gathering ideas. In terms of the training and organization of national mobilization, pay close attention to making the Three Principles of the People popular throughout the country, and let men, women, old and young deeply root in people's hearts. Colleagues dare to use 12% of their sincerity and do their best as a member of the people, and will never change. They will surely win the war of resistance and build the country, so as to respond to the martyrs, the people, and the friendly countries who sympathize with and maintain us, and complete the responsibility of national participation in politics. Fang Wei is the day of revolutionary success. I hereby give a speech. (Electric report on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Vice-Chairman of the National Political Council, Zhang, gave a speech at the closing ceremony. The following is a supplementary record: Vice-Chairman Zhang said, today is the closing day of the third session of the National Political Council. Let me briefly talk about my personal feelings. When our first session of the National Political Council was convened, I personally did not have a very clear understanding of the National Political Council. I thought there were many difficulties. If the various parties and factions acted in their own way, it would be difficult to unite. After the meeting, I felt that there was hope and that it was not difficult to go to the national crisis together and be of one mind. When the second meeting was held, I felt that there was more progress. When this meeting was held, I felt that the mission we were responsible for in the first stage could be completed. This time, Chairman Chiang came to be the chairman. Seeing everyone's warm welcome to the chairman and seeing everyone's respect when the chairman spoke, everyone recognized the significance of this meeting. During this meeting, our proposals were also discussed very carefully by everyone, but at the same time, we know that everyone is not here just to discuss the proposals. I think we also have a second, more important mission. How do we complete the work of realizing democratic politics, and how do we reach this matter smoothly from tutelage to constitutional government? I learned that it was much more important than discussing the contents of a few proposals. This meeting went very smoothly. What was especially different from the previous two meetings was that the General Assembly had a clearer understanding of everyone's responsibilities than before, and everyone's spirits were particularly high. After listening to the chairman's several speeches, I understood the path forward. Everyone is very willing to follow the chairman to carry out our work and realize our expectations. I hope that we can continue to work hard in the future based on the current spirit, so as to lay the foundation of China's democratic political country and complete our second phase of the mission.

<h3>The Chinese Army Firmly Defends Tongguan; The Japanese Army Repeatedly Attempts to Sneak Across Unsuccessfully, Cutting Off the Longhai Road is a Dream</h3>
<p>Tongguan: Although the war between the Chinese and Japanese armies has been going on for almost a year, the Chinese army has twice recaptured Fenglingdu, but was finally reoccupied by the Japanese army. The front lines of both sides are less than two miles apart. The lives of the Chinese people are almost the same as before the war. An Associated Press reporter, led by the Chinese army, climbed the mountain to observe Fenglingdu, crawling on the ground, because Japanese snipers sometimes shot. There is very little military activity in Fenglingdu, because there are not many Japanese troops in the city, and they dare not go out, because Chinese snipers are very active, and the Chinese people had already withdrawn completely before the Japanese army occupied the city. The Associated Press reporter saw concrete machine gun positions all over the Yellow River bank, as well as communication trenches. According to the Chinese army, since February 7, 1938, the Japanese army has fired 40,000 shells at Tongguan, so Tongguan has become a ruin, with very few people. The Japanese army's attempt to cut off the Longhai Road has not succeeded. Tongguan originally had 50,000 residents, and now there are only 30,000. The central government recently allocated 40,000 yuan to relieve the poor, purchase salt and rice, and build caves to avoid air raids (Associated Press report on the 18th).</p>
<p>Tongguan: The Yellow River was originally a disaster for China, but now it has been regarded as a friend of China, because the muddy water of the Yellow River is the main factor in preventing the Japanese army from advancing to the northwest. Where the Yellow River folds to the north, the front lines of the Chinese and Japanese armies are less than two miles apart between Tongguan and Fenglingdu. Chinese military personnel told the Associated Press reporter that the Yellow River is a friend of the Chinese side, because the weather was warm in December last year and January this year, and the Japanese army concentrated its efforts to cross the river, but failed, and had to use bamboo rafts and rubber boats. The Japanese army attempted to cross the river at Yumen, 35 miles north of Tongguan, in January, and attempted to sneak across 3 miles east of Fenglingdu yesterday, but both failed. The Japanese army covered its infantry crossing the river with fierce artillery fire, but the Chinese army resisted with machine guns and artillery. It is expected that the Japanese army will attack in March and June, but the floods in July and August will prevent the Japanese army from crossing the river. The Associated Press reporter rode on a comfortable American-style train on the Longhai Road at night, and got off 20 miles from Tongguan. The train accelerated when it passed through the dangerous area. Japanese artillery constantly bombarded. The reporter planned to enter the nearby city at midnight, but the guards did not allow it, so he slept in the open air. In the morning, he walked along the road. The dust on the road was six inches deep, and when the wind rose, the flying dust blew on his face. Near Tongguan, the reporter had to take temporary shelter in the mountain paths for fear of Japanese artillery bombardment. The Chinese artillery is the latest type of foreign artillery, with a longer range and accurate aiming. It has destroyed ten Japanese artillery pieces and killed hundreds of Japanese artillerymen. Not long ago, the Japanese army crossed the river to the east of Yumen, but was eventually driven back by the Chinese army. The Japanese army died 400-500 people, and the Chinese army suffered roughly the same number of casualties. According to the Chinese army, "The Chinese army's defense of the Longhai Road is the strongest, and the Japanese army cannot encircle Tongguan from the south of the Longhai Road, because the area is mountainous." If the Japanese army succeeds in crossing the river, the Chinese trenches and other defenses along the mountain will also be enough to resist the Japanese army's advance. There are 2,000 Japanese troops and 20 Japanese artillery pieces between Fenglingdu and Puzhou, and 4,000 Japanese troops along the Tongpu Road. The Chinese army has sufficient strength and is mostly composed of experienced soldiers. The Chinese guerrilla forces north of the Yellow River are not allowed to cross south to disrupt the Japanese army's rear. If the Japanese army wants to cross the river, it must greatly increase its troops. (Associated Press report on the 17th)</p>
<h3>The Sino-American Cultural Association Established in Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Sino-American Cultural Association held its inaugural meeting in Chongqing at 5 pm on the 22nd, and elected Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek and Henry Stimson as honorary presidents, H.H.

<h3>US and UK Echo Each Other, Actively Enhancing National Defense: US House of Representatives Discusses Expanding Military Ports, UK Expansion of Armaments Has Significant Impact</h3>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives began discussing the bill to add naval and air bases today. Although the atmosphere in the chamber was tense, those in the congressional lounge generally believe that the bill will pass with a large majority. At the opening of the session, Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson (Democrat) delivered a lengthy speech defending the bill, stating, "Today, dictators are brutal and unreasonable. The United States has no other option but to add naval and air bases. Only in this way can dictators be warned. Moreover, the United States must strengthen its general defense capabilities to be prepared for any eventuality." Thereupon, Republican Congressman Fish stood up to question, saying that Guam's terrain is strategically important. Once naval and air bases are established there, it will be like holding a dagger to Japan's throat, which will inevitably provoke a strong reaction from the Japanese side. The international situation is already precarious, with rumors rife and everyone on edge. Establishing defenses on Guam might even trigger a war. Should we not be cautious? Vinson immediately replied that the United States does not intend to establish defenses on Guam, but only plans to set up an air base there to protect its transportation lines to the Netherlands East Indies, ensuring that the United States' sources of raw materials are not interrupted. The establishment of an air base on Guam is of vital importance to the defense of the American coast. Any Asian power hoping to target American Hawaii and the American mainland will have to take this into consideration and will not dare to act rashly. At this point, another Congressman raised a question regarding the UK and France invading the US to purchase military aircraft. Vinson further replied that supplying military aircraft to the UK and France, two major democracies, is in fact safeguarding the interests of our country. If the UK and France are destroyed, the United States will inevitably be isolated. According to the bill to expand naval and air bases, it stipulates that the government is authorized to use $52,000,000 to build twelve naval and air bases, and another large sum of $1,800,000 is allocated for aeronautical research. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons continued its debate on the defense budget this afternoon. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately delivered a speech, stating, "The defense budget for the next fiscal year amounts to a total of £580,000,000, which is comparable to the total national debt of our country at the outbreak of the European War. This is of great significance. I wonder if the gentlemen of the House of Commons are aware of this. Although our expansion of armaments is on a large scale, it is only for defensive purposes. We have no intention of aggression." (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Declaration: Striving to Save the European Situation, The Time for a Disarmament Conference is Not Yet Ripe, Starting with Restoring Trust</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons today at the beginning of the second day of the defense debate had two main points: first, the large-scale arms race among the world's countries is mostly the result of mutual misunderstanding, and second, the opposition party should not nitpick or create inappropriate suspicions, lest the misunderstanding be exacerbated. When he listened to the defense debate yesterday, he felt that there was no previous agitation, argument, or anxiety. The general impression he gained was that the entire House was oppressed by the facts and, in light of the truth of the situation, had to agree on the current armament expansion plan and the methods for implementing this plan, such as raising funds. He recalled that last year the Labour Party had repeatedly stated the need for collective security and the basic policies of the League of Nations, but in today's environment, it has understood the futility of resorting to the League of Nations and has had to adopt other methods to maintain general peace and national security.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, saying that civil defense is slightly behind the three major defenses of the navy, army, and air force. He said that the organization led by Minister Anderson is currently adopting necessary plans, which will soon be announced. The UK's air defense plan has already yielded results.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also praised the talent of Lord Chatfield, the Minister for Coordination of Defense, saying that his experience is sufficient to fulfill his duties pleasantly. However, he must attend the House of Lords, so Morrison was specifically appointed as his representative in the House of Commons to answer questions about defense coordination in the House of Commons, but not as the Minister of Munitions. Recently, the production of armaments has increased greatly, which can ensure that the Air Ministry has enough aircraft and other supplies. From this, it can be seen that the government's decision not to establish a Ministry of Munitions is appropriate.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then spoke of the financial situation, saying that he did not know if the House of Commons had recognized the full significance of the defense expenditure proposed by the government. The total amount is £580 million for the last two years of the five-year plan. If it is necessary to increase public debt in the last two years, then the Chancellor of the Exchequer may wish to ask the House of Commons again. This statement may not be wrong. That is to say, we will still need to raise debts after the five-year period, but what he is concerned about is not only this. Once the defense plan is completed, it will be necessary to raise regular maintenance fees. How much will the future maintenance fees be? We cannot make an arbitrary judgment now, but if the House of Commons recalls what Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon said, the amount that can be obtained from taxes next year is £230 million, then we cannot but doubt that the annual cost of maintaining this armament, plus the interest on the debt repayment fund, will not exceed tax revenue. This is a serious point, and we cannot take it lightly.</p>
<p>He does not want to make any suggestions on how to solve this problem now, but if we allow the situation to develop and do not think about trying to stop it, then it would be a sin. Someone spoke yesterday, thinking that the time has come to convene a disarmament conference of various countries. If he could believe that convening such a conference at this time could be effective, (someone in the hall shouted "Why not try it?"), he would have convened it without hesitation. (Applause from the audience). The world has not yet established sufficient trust. Convening such a meeting at this time would be practically ineffective, but if we ourselves show a little trust and do not easily believe rumors of other countries' aggressive intentions, then it may not be without benefit. He is sometimes criticized for not criticizing political enemies for fomenting war. In fact, he did not say that his political enemies wanted to start a war, but he believes that the policies currently adopted by his political enemies seem to be policies that could lead to war. Although our country's armaments are on a large scale, they are only for defensive purposes. If other countries are indeed like the UK and have no intention of aggression, then the only conclusion we can come to is that we are all competing to destroy the national vitality under misunderstanding. This statement is almost the truth. We really cannot relax our efforts to expand armaments until we have obtained general agreement from other countries to reduce armaments, but we should pay attention to possible opportunities and use them to persuade other governments to follow the path that the UK is currently taking and end the situation that will inevitably lead all European countries to ruin. This is also our responsibility. (Members cheered). (Reuters dispatch, 21st) Members of various parties spoke one after another, and all avoided criticizing the armament expansion plan. Some even advocated expanding the scope. Although some members said that the current diplomatic policy was not entirely appropriate, they unanimously expressed their approval of Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement on the shared relationship between the UK and France. Conservative Party member Churchill, Liberal Party member Mander, and others requested the government to issue a statement saying that when war breaks out in continental Europe, the UK should dispatch an expeditionary force to that place.</p>
<p>Opposition Labour Party member Attlee said of the collective security system, "Prime Minister Chamberlain has now reversed cause and effect. The armament expansion plan is not proof of the victory of the Prime Minister's policies, but proof of failure." The Labour Party's request to reduce the number of public debts from £800,000,000 to £799,000,000 is to show that the defense budget is clear proof that the Prime Minister's policies have failed. Regarding the shared relationship between the UK and France, the Prime Minister recently issued a statement saying that if France is attacked, no matter where the attack comes from, the UK will definitely help France. We absolutely agree with this, because the security of the UK and France are closely related. It is regrettable that the UK has become almost completely isolated after implementing the collective security system, with only France as its only reliable ally. I wonder if the government has ever had talks with the Soviet Union so that the world situation can become stable. If war breaks out in Europe, I wonder what efforts the UK is prepared to make in terms of the army. For now, the government should immediately establish a Ministry of Defense to handle matters exclusively. The government has also sacrificed the most important principles in spirit. People generally feel that Prime Minister Chamberlain is leaning towards aggression and dictatorship. Please the government lean towards freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Conservative extremist Churchill expressed his approval of the armament expansion plan, saying, "I have no objection to raising the amount of public debt to be issued. It is particularly regrettable that this method was not done earlier. The proposal to establish a Ministry of Munitions should also be implemented as soon as possible. All things that can make aggressive countries fear, most of the public opinion in the UK and the US agree with. The defense expenditure we are discussing today, as well as the accidents that occur daily in the US, and the accidents that occur in France and Eastern Europe, can all make aggressive countries fear. Regarding the shared relationship between the UK and France, Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent statement is satisfactory. At a time when the pressure of aggressive countries is increasing, this is the main barrier to preventing violence. The army general staff of the UK and France must now maintain close contact. When war breaks out in the future, what kind of assistance the UK can provide must be clearly defined, and it must be comprehensive."</p>
<p>Liberal Party member Mander said that the government issued a statement on September 26th of last year, saying that it would assist France and the Soviet Union in resisting aggression. Now, it should repeat the statement. The Ministry of Munitions should also be established as soon as possible. When war breaks out in Europe in the future, troops should also be sent to the mainland. As for the compulsory military service system, the people will definitely accept it when necessary. Conservative Party member Amery requested the government to issue a statement saying that as soon as war breaks out in Europe, troops should be sent to France. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain has offered a promise to assist France, this promise is worthless if the general staff of the UK and France do not agree on a cooperation plan. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Conservative Party member Churchill described the current era as an era of bloodless warfare. Everyone hopes and prays that this kind of warfare will never be bloody, and that true peace can finally appear. Conservative Party Rear Admiral Sueter said that the UK needs airships and more tanks. The government underestimates submarines. Germany is now building the same number of submarines as the UK. This point should be noted. The 200 small airships built during the European War were used to resist submarines and were very effective. Please the government set up more training ships and build more airships for wartime needs. It is heard that the UK only has 600 tanks, while France has 4,500, and Italy has as many as 11,000. If the UK needs to send troops overseas in the future, it will need more tanks. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Siam Expresses Goodwill to the UK</h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian's Singapore dispatch stated that the Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Straits Settlements, Thomas, recently toured Siam. People in Bangkok gave him a warm welcome. Anyone who has been to Bangkok has commented on this matter, recognizing it as a pleasant sign of Anglo-Siamese friendship. In recent years, Japan has been trying hard to establish relations with Siam. No fewer than six goodwill missions have departed from Japan to Bangkok, and it is rumored that Japan intends to build a canal through the Kra Isthmus. According to engineers, this is technically impossible. In any case, the cost is definitely beyond Japan's financial capacity. Siam's diplomatic policy is aimed at maintaining a balance between the UK, France, and Japan. Thomas's formal tour of Bangkok is very valuable because it shows the Siamese that the UK recognizes Siamese friendship as extremely important. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>UK and French General Staffs Will Conduct Negotiations Soon, Paris Newspapers Express Satisfaction and Welcome the UK Prime Minister's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers here are satisfied with Morrison's statement in the House of Commons on behalf of the Minister for Coordination of Defense that the UK and French general staffs will conduct talks soon. Several newspapers also advocate that the UK should have a stronger army so that when war breaks out, it can send elite troops to support France. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The political circles in Rome were very pleased to hear the remarks made by UK Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday, and the Italian newspapers were very satisfied that the UK Prime Minister acknowledged that the League of Nations had become a dead object. They also agreed with the UK Prime Minister's preparations for discussing disarmament and his warning not to listen to rumors of other countries' aggressive intentions. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Express published a message this morning, saying that Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to propose a peaceful solution to the issues related to Italy's demands for French Tunisia, Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal. It also said that the recent negotiations between the UK authorities and the Spanish National Military Government on the recognition issue are related to this matter. The diplomatic circles here have denied this news, saying that the UK and Italian governments have never exchanged views on Italy's demands. The talks between the UK Ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently were limited to discussing the issue of increasing troops in Italy's Libyan territory in North Africa. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Undersecretary of State Butler declared in the House of Commons today that, according to the UK government's knowledge, the official number of troops stationed in Italian East Africa is 69,654. The exact number has naturally changed from time to time, but it seems to have increased in the past few months. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>China's Overseas Cash Totals $400 Million</h3>
<p>(New York) The "Far East Magazine," edited by the Pacific International Institute, recently published a statement saying that since the US government implemented the silver purchase policy and signed the Silver Agreement with the Chinese government, the amount of cash that the Chinese government continues to store abroad for war expenses has been a matter of general concern, but officials have never announced it. It is now known that the amount that can be mobilized at any time is approximately $400,000,000, which is more than what Japan has stored. According to the report made by Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, before the outbreak of war between China and Japan in 1937, China exported silver worth approximately $250,000,000. Last year, it exported approximately $160,000,000. The sum of the two is equal to $400,000,000. (Havas air dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to statistics released by the Department of Commerce, Japan purchased goods from the US in 1938 worth a total of $239,575,000, of which aircraft accounted for $11,000,000, gasoline accounted for $50,000,000, steel accounted for $22,000,000, steel products accounted for $9,000,000, cotton accounted for $52,000,000, copper accounted for $22,000,000, automobiles accounted for $17,000,000, machinery accounted for $23,000,000, and other miscellaneous goods were worth approximately $33,000,000. According to this figure, this accounts for only 14% of the total amount. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>UK Economic Director Meets with German Authorities, Visiting Goering Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Walterkin, the Economic Director of the UK Foreign Office, has been in Berlin for several days to hold talks with important figures in German economic and industrial circles. Goering, the dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan and Minister of Aviation, is scheduled to receive him on the 24th of this month. At the same time, Economic Minister Funk will also schedule a meeting with him. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After arriving here, Walterkin, the Economic Director of the UK Foreign Office, held talks with most of the important figures in German economic and industrial circles today to prepare for future Anglo-German commercial negotiations. According to British sources, these talks are of an informal nature. Director Walterkin must return to his country on the 25th of this month. (Joint Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) UK Foreign Office Economic Director Walterkin visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday and held a long talk with German Foreign Ministry Economic Director Weier in the afternoon. Both talks were to prepare for the Anglo-German economic negotiations that will begin on March 15th. At that time, UK Secretary of Commerce Stanley and Secretary for Overseas Trade Hudson will jointly arrive in Germany. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) An authoritative source here has denied reports in London newspapers that German Economic Minister Funk will visit London in the spring. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today's Foreign Affairs News published an article, sternly refuting any suggestion that the UK wants to give Germany economic assistance in order to use the spirit of the Munich Agreement to open up a path for glorious coexistence between the two countries. The true motive for the UK's willingness to negotiate with Germany is not tolerance, but for its own benefit. The Hamburg Daily News expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that UK Secretary for Overseas Trade Henderson will go to Moscow after visiting Berlin. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>UK and Russian Old Debts May Be Resolved</h3>
<p>(London) Since the Russian Revolution, the Soviet Union has not agreed to repay the UK debts owed during the Tsarist era. The UK Conservative Party has often used this as an excuse to oppose adjusting political relations with the Soviet Union and increasing trade volume. However, according to well-informed sources here, the main task of Secretary for Overseas Trade Hudson's trip to Moscow next month is to urge the Soviet government to resolve this debt issue and to issue a "symbolic payment" to prevent certain individuals in the Conservative Party from using this as a talking point again. At the same time, Hudson should also take the opportunity to make efforts to promote friendly relations. Since the UK Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, has been talking with the authorities of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee recently, he feels that the Soviet authorities are dissatisfied with the Munich Agreement, so they have at least temporarily abandoned the policy of cooperating with various democratic countries in Western Europe. People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of that country, Litvinov, even said, "The Soviet Union can no longer trust the various democratic countries." However, the general impression here is that the Soviet government will not adopt a stubbornly isolationist policy in international affairs. Therefore, Ambassador Seeds has been actively working in Moscow for some time, trying to explain to the Soviet authorities that the UK's attitude is an excessive measure. One day, the UK will be able to make efforts to maintain peace with a positive attitude. Observing Ambassador Seeds' activities, it can be seen that the UK government intends to rely on the Soviet Union as a factor in the near future to deal with certain countries. Once the UK's armament expansion plan has achieved preliminary success, Prime Minister Chamberlain may no longer use the moderate wording of his speech in the House of Commons yesterday. This can be asserted. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Ciano Going to Poland Tonight, Discussing Central European Issues</h3>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to go directly to Warsaw tomorrow night to visit the Polish government authorities for a three-day stay in order to hold talks with the country's Foreign Minister, Colonel Beck, and then go hunting in the Białowieża Forest. Well-informed sources here attach great importance to the Foreign Minister's trip, saying that the Foreign Minister will consult with the Polish authorities on the Central European situation, including the situation in Hungary and Yugoslavia. In addition, what Poland's attitude will be if conflicts occur between France and Italy, and what Poland's wishes are regarding the colonial issue, Foreign Minister Ciano will take the opportunity to ask the Polish authorities. Also, it was originally rumored that Foreign Minister Ciano would go to Berlin during his visit to Poland, but it is generally believed that the Foreign Minister will not go to Germany at this time.

<h3>US Continues to Cooperate with the League of Nations in Non-Political Aspects, Promoting Human Happiness and Establishing International Order</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news here today, the US has accepted the invitation to participate in various technical and non-political activities of the League of Nations as a non-member. The Department of State has issued a document accepting this invitation, stating that the US believes that this steady step to promote human happiness is directly related to the establishment of an international order that the US believes is necessary for true peace. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly passed a resolution last September, instructing the Secretariat to notify the governments of non-member countries, saying, "All suggestions or opinions related to countries wishing to expand the scope of cooperation with the League of Nations in technical rather than political matters are welcomed by the member states of the League of Nations." After League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol notified the non-member countries according to this resolution, the first reply was received today, which was sent by US Secretary of State Hull. Its main point is that the US government has been working closely with the League of Nations on various technical issues, including disarmament issues, since 1924. In the future, it should continue to follow this path and make efforts to expand the scope of technical rather than political cooperation between the US and the League of Nations. This reply is quite in line with the US's traditional policy and has caused a good impression. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Air Defense Exercises to Be Held in Berlin, Testing Air Defense Balloons</h3>
<p>(Berlin) A large-scale air defense exercise will be held here in the near future, and two types of barrier balloons, circular and elliptical, will be used to protect the capital's airspace. This is an innovation in the history of German air defense. According to evening newspapers, this new air defense tool was tested once over the Leuna chemical factory in Halle last September, reaching a height of several thousand meters (the average height of German clouds has been below 3,000 meters in the past ten months), and its air defense effectiveness exceeds anti-aircraft guns. The cost of each balloon is also only one-third of that of a small-caliber anti-aircraft gun shell, and it can stay in the air for several weeks. If necessary, it can also be taken down and re-injected with light gas. If an aircraft's wings touch the balloon, the entire aircraft will be trapped by the barrier balloon and unable to continue flying for several hundred meters. If the aircraft's propeller touches the balloon cable, the fuselage will immediately fall to the ground. If this kind of barrier balloon is installed over the Elbe River, it will be enough to protect the capital's airspace from enemy air raids. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Balkan Conference Concludes Yesterday: Four Nations' Policies Aligned</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania – The Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente nations (Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece) officially closed today in the capital of Romania. Romanian Foreign Minister Gheorghe Gafencu told reporters that the Balkan Entente nations have agreed in principle to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government. However, each nation will individually choose an appropriate time to grant recognition. Furthermore, according to a press release issued by the Standing Political Conference, representatives from the four nations (Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece) meticulously exchanged opinions on various issues related to the Balkan Entente. A complete agreement has been reached regarding the common policies that the four nations should adopt. The close and interconnected relationship that the four nations should maintain has also been reiterated at this conference. The next Standing Political Conference is scheduled to be held in February of next year in the capital of Yugoslavia. The current Standing Economic Conference will reconvene here in April of this year. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Burgos – Representatives from the Balkan Entente nations (Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece), who recently held a conference in the capital of Romania, have decided in principle to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government. The Turkish government, in accordance with this decision, has taken the lead in recognizing the Nationalist government as the legitimate government. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Parisian newspaper "Paris-Midi," the Balkan Entente conference has abandoned hope of inviting Bulgaria to join the Balkan Pact. The Bulgarian authorities are not satisfied with moral support and insist that the Balkan Entente nations make territorial concessions. However, this request has been rejected by the Balkan nations. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania – Foreign Minister Gheorghe Gafencu met with Bulgarian Minister Dimitrov yesterday. Well-informed sources here comment that Foreign Minister Gafencu and Greek Prime Minister Metaxas (currently participating in the Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente nations here) recently delivered speeches at a banquet, expressing goodwill towards Bulgaria. Foreign Minister Gafencu's meeting with the Bulgarian Minister should be given due attention. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>France and Iran Restore Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>(Paris) Iran and France formally restored diplomatic relations yesterday after severing them on December 28th of last year. Approximately forty Iranian students in France, who had suspended their studies and returned to their country due to the severance of relations between the two countries, have now returned here to resume their studies. It is noted that a French magazine published a short piece last year using the word "chat" (cat in French) in a way that sounded like the title of the King of Iran. The Iranian royal family was deeply dissatisfied and severed relations with France. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Dutch Representatives Arrive in the United States to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Dutch government, in order to strengthen the defense of the Dutch East Indies, plans to order bombers from the United States. A delegation, led by retired Rear Admiral Van Holthe tot Echten, has been sent to the United States and has now arrived here. They will soon visit the Army Department authorities.

<p>The Hague – During a debate in the Dutch Second Chamber on the budget for the Dutch East Indies, Colonial Minister Welter, in response to questions from National Socialist Party member Wiesen, stated that the exchange of intelligence between the Dutch and British governments regarding the defense of the Far East is of an ordinary and technical nature. In response to questions about German and Soviet propaganda broadcasts to the Dutch East Indies, he stated that the Dutch East Indies government plans to prohibit private individuals from receiving foreign radio news broadcasts without authorization.

<h3>Spanish Nationalists Express Final Stance: No Amnesty Allowed, but Determined to Maintain Independence. French Representative to Visit Burgos Again.</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here have announced that the Spanish Nationalist government recently sent a note to the British and French governments, stating two points: 1. The government forces must surrender unconditionally, and the Nationalist government will not issue an amnesty decree. 2. The Nationalist government will not tolerate any foreign forces that could undermine the independence and sovereignty of Spain. This is the final statement of Nationalist Commander-in-Chief General Franco. The British government will inform the Madrid Republican government of the British and French efforts to persuade the Nationalist government to cease hostilities, strongly urging them to abandon their resistance policy and informing them that even if the Republican government continues to resist, the British and French recognition of the Nationalist government will not be delayed. Once this is done, the French cabinet will discuss the results of Senator Péret's talks with the Spanish Nationalist authorities. Prime Minister Chamberlain will then formally announce the recognition of the Nationalist government as the legitimate government in the House of Commons early next week. He will also discuss Anglo-Italian relations in light of the recent talks between British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, stating that the continued anti-French propaganda in Italian newspapers is undermining Anglo-Italian relations.

<p>Saint-Jean-de-Luz – Right-wing Senator Péret, after holding talks with General Jordana, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Spanish Nationalist government, immediately reported everything to Foreign Minister Bonnet by long-distance telephone here and sent a written report to the Foreign Minister. It is learned that Péret is scheduled to return to Burgos, Spain, on the 22nd of this month for a final round of talks with General Jordana in order to thoroughly resolve the issue of France's de jure recognition of the Nationalist government. His entourage is scheduled to travel there the day before. Péret told a Havas News Agency reporter, "France's intention to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government de jure is a unilateral action based on its own free will. There is no negotiation, and no conditions are being proposed. However, before formal recognition, all outstanding issues must be resolved, and misunderstandings must be clarified."

<h3>Discussion of Important Resolutions at the Third Session of the National Political Council: Amendments to the Military Service Law (2 Cases), Improvements to Judicial System (3 Cases), National Spiritual Mobilization Plan</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Third Session of the National Political Council has concluded successfully. The resolutions passed have been reported daily in previous dispatches. The following is a supplementary report on the discussion and passage of important resolutions:</p>
<p>Two Amendments to the Military Service Law: At this session, the government submitted two proposals concerning the Military Service Law. 1. Proposal to amend the Provisional Regulations on the Military Service Law. The Review Committee's report explained the following: The main significance of the government's proposal is that civil servants, students, and other intellectuals should be conscripted to serve as an example. Furthermore, according to popular custom, only sons are valued more than eldest sons. Therefore, it is proposed to amend the exemption provisions of the Military Service Law. Clause 1 of the original Article 29 (those who are the eldest son in the family) is amended to (those who are the only son in the family). Clause 4 (those who hold a simplified appointment) is deleted and moved to the provisions on deferred service. However, they must still be subject to mobilization and conscription during wartime. Furthermore, Clause 1 of the deferred service (original Article 30), those studying in junior high schools or equivalent schools, is amended to (those who are granted positions above the delegated rank by the central and provincial governments according to the national official system). The Review Committee believes that the government's amendment is sufficient to demonstrate equality and dispel misunderstandings and should be approved. However, it is proposed to amend the first clause of deferred service to (those who are currently holding positions above the delegated rank granted by the central and provincial governments according to the national official system). The remaining amendments to deferred service will be submitted to the government for review and amendment. The resolution was passed according to the Review Committee's opinion. 2. Proposal to promote the widespread implementation of the payment-based deferred service system to benefit military service. The Review Committee's opinion is that military service is a national obligation and should have no exceptions in principle. However, the government's intention is to take into account the facts and reduce abuses. Therefore, it is proposed that the government, in formulating the payment-based deferred service system, should include strict restrictions, stipulate time limits, and implement it temporarily. The measures should be unified, and the area should not necessarily be universal. In order to prevent the current abuses of wealthy sons evading military service, the payment-based deferred service system should have graded regulations, and the minimum amount should be at least 200 yuan per period of deferred service, increasing progressively according to property, so as not to encourage everyone to have a deferred service mentality. All deferred service payments should be designated for the benefit of the families of soldiers on expeditions. The proposed trial period is one year and will be abolished within the 29th year. The resolution was passed according to the Review Committee's opinion. The original text of the two proposals is as follows: 1. Proposal to amend the Provisional Regulations on the Implementation of the Military Service Law. Reasons: The Provisional Regulations on the Implementation of the Military Service Law are important regulations for the implementation of military service. They were amended in April of the 27th year based on experience. Subsequently, the Changsha Supreme Military Council resolved that the exemption provisions in the Military Service Law should be amended, and that eligible individuals of the intellectual class, such as students and civil servants, should also be conscripted as an example. This should be complied with. Also, the previous provision of exempting only sons from regular military service was changed to exempting eldest sons, as only sons often undergo changes, and it is difficult to handle military service matters. For example, if two brothers, one is conscripted into the army, and the other dies at home, the family can request a transfer and send the brother in the army home, which is not only costly but also very troublesome. Therefore, based on the experience of the 25th and 26th years, only sons were changed to eldest sons. However, social customs value only sons, and changing eldest sons to only sons does not create a good social impression. Now, in order to consider human feelings and customs, it is proposed to change the provision of exempting eldest sons from regular military service back to exempting only sons from regular military service. As for the conscription of national soldiers for regular military service during wartime, it seems difficult to implement in the case of only sons. It is proposed to clearly stipulate that they are exempt from conscription. In addition, those whose families cannot maintain a minimum standard of living if they are conscripted into active military service are also proposed to be given discretionary accommodation in consideration of human feelings and facts. All methods of exempting from regular military service and serving in the national army, as well as deferred and suspended service methods, are proposed to be amended accordingly. This is what we should do and respectfully await your decision. 2. Proposal to promote the widespread implementation of the payment-based deferred service system to benefit military service. The purpose of our country's implementation of the Military Service Law and the adoption of conscription is to improve the quality of the army and complete the foundation of military construction. At the beginning of the implementation, it coincided with the start of the War of Resistance, and the replenishment of soldiers became increasingly urgent. Although efforts have been made to promote military service obligations, it is difficult to completely eliminate long-standing habits. Wealthy families often evade military service in various ways, which is difficult to prevent. If handled carelessly, it may lead to corruption. It is proposed to widely promote the payment-based deferred service system, allowing those who are unwilling to serve in the military to pay a corresponding amount of money to be granted deferred service. This method has been quite effective since its implementation in Guangxi Province and seems suitable for widespread promotion to benefit the military administration. The principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength" can be realized, thereby achieving the goal of jointly saving the country. It is most appropriate to use these payments to provide relief to the families of soldiers on expeditions. The reasons for universally promoting the payment-based deferred service system are hereby submitted for your decision. In addition, Councilor Huang Yanpei et al. proposed a motion to assist in improving military service, and Councilor Liang Shuming et al. proposed points that urgently need to be improved in the handling of military service. Separate proposals were also passed and sent to the government for adoption and implementation. The government and the councilors are both closely paying attention to the promotion of military service and striving for improvement. The future of military service is deeply dependent on this.</p>
<p>Various Proposals for Improving the Judiciary: A total of three proposals were submitted at this session regarding the improvement of the judiciary: 1. Councilor Kong Geng et al. proposed a motion to improve the judiciary by adopting the Lu Sanji-ism and abolishing the system of specially appointed vetting officials. This proposal was submitted at the Second Session of the Council, and it was resolved to be reserved for detailed discussion at the next session. Councilor Kong also submitted a memorandum on supplementary opinions for improving the judicial system at this session. 2. The Judicial Yuan submitted a proposal to improve the judicial system. This proposal was submitted by the government based on Councilor Kong's proposal. 3. Councilor Zhou Lan et al. proposed a motion to strengthen the judicial system. The above three proposals were merged for review and submitted at the Fifth Session. The opinion of the Third Review Committee was to suggest to the Council to establish a special committee to be reviewed by legal experts designated by the Speaker to show caution. There was considerable debate at the time. Councilor Lu Dingkui stated that Zhou's proposal was not of a particularly specialized nature and could be discussed by the Council. Kong's proposal and the proposal submitted by the Judicial Yuan should be left for discussion at the next session. Councilor Luo Wengan suggested that Zhou's proposal be discussed by the Council and that the other two proposals be submitted directly to the Legislative Yuan for reference. Later, Councilor Shen Junru made a temporary motion disagreeing with the proposal to postpone the discussion, saying that the Council should not freely abandon its powers and that the proposal submitted by the Judicial Yuan and Kong's proposal, which had not been discussed or reviewed, should be sent to the Legislative Yuan or postponed to the next session. Kong's proposal was originally postponed from the previous session, and the Judicial Yuan was asked to consider it and submit its opinion at this session. Now that the Judicial Yuan respects the Council's opinion and has submitted a proposal, it should be reviewed first. It was then resolved that the Speaker should designate several councilors who study law to form a special review committee to formulate a review opinion and submit it for discussion at the next session. Subsequently, the Speaker designated Zhou Lan, Chu Fucheng, Shen Junru, Lu Dingkui, Zhang Shizhao, Xie Jian, Tao Baichuan, Zhou Binglin, Kong Geng, Luo Wengan, and Shi Liang as members of the special review committee, with Zhou Lan and Luo Wengan as conveners. Councilor Shen Junru et al. also proposed a motion to reduce the litigation burden on the people, which has also been passed and sent to the government for adoption. The above proposals are related to the improvement of the judicial system, and their contents are important. The Review Committee has conducted detailed research, and the Council has also discussed them repeatedly. The councilors have expressed many opinions and debated repeatedly before making separate decisions. The councilors' seriousness and thoroughness in studying major national issues can be seen from this.</p>
<p>National Spiritual Mobilization Plan: At 3:00 p.m. on the 20th, during the eighth session, Speaker Jiang presented a report on the National Spiritual Mobilization, the outline of which is as follows: National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and Implementation Measures. 1.

<p>Report of the Special Committee:</p>
<p>At the eighth session held on the 20th, the special committee submitted a review report on the implementation of the resolutions of the first and second sessions of the Council, which was passed. The report stated that the first and second sessions of the Council discussed a total of 222 cases, of which about 140 were passed, about 30 were for reference, more than 10 were reserved, and more than 30 were for telegram declarations and revocations. Of the more than 140 cases that were passed, most were of a positive and constructive nature and were beneficial to the War of Resistance and national construction. The Supreme National Defense Council resolved that 98% of the cases transferred by the Council had been distributed to the competent authorities for proper handling, indicating that the government was giving appropriate attention to the resolutions. As for the handling of the transferred cases by the competent authorities, generally speaking, about 80 cases were under review, and about 40 were under review, discussion, or referral. As for the implementation and effects of the cases under review, it is difficult to ascertain the details due to the lack of materials and time. Therefore, in order to promote future implementation effectiveness, the following suggestions are made: 1. The government should urge the implementation of all previously passed cases, and for future cases, when they are distributed to the competent authorities, it is hoped that they will be implemented within a time limit as far as possible. 2. The relevant authorities should provide more detailed reports on the implementation of the Council's resolutions. If there are difficulties or problems in the implementation of important cases or expert reports, please also provide detailed explanations so that we can study and resolve them together. 3. The implementation of each case should be reviewed by the resident committee at any time, and the secretariat should assist in verifying it and report it to the Council at each session. Conveners: Jiang Yong, Hang Liwu.</p>
<p>Statistics on Proposal Results: The Council had a total of 86 proposals, 1 report, and 6 motions submitted by the government. The remaining 80 motions were submitted by the councilors. Except for 2 cases that were left for discussion at the next session and 2 cases that were completely reserved, all other cases were passed and sent to the government for adoption or reference. It is noted that among the 86 motions, those related to domestic affairs were the most, with 28 cases, followed by those related to military and national defense, with 19 cases, economic and financial cases with 18 cases, educational and cultural cases with 17 cases, and diplomatic and international cases with the least, with only 3 cases. In addition, there was one case of a general nature, namely the wartime administrative plan submitted by the government. The first session had a total of 130 cases, the second session had 89 cases, and although this session had only 87 cases, the importance of its content surpassed the previous two sessions.

<h3>London Figures Pay Attention to Situation in Shanghai; Remain Resolved to Confront Japan; Will Not Allow Forced Changes to the Administration of the Concessions</h3>
<p>(London) All sectors in contact with Far Eastern affairs are currently anxious about the overall situation in Shanghai. Political circles do not wish to comment on the British government's attitude until the actual nature of the demands made by the Japanese authorities to the Shanghai Municipal Council is known. However, the public remembers that the British government has always treated any move to forcibly change the administration of the Public Concession with a serious demeanor. When the Japanese authorities made demands to the Municipal Council in January 1938, the British government's attitude was resolutely evident. Therefore, Far Eastern observers, based on all past experience, believe that the British government's attitude today will not be less resolute than before. Both the Public Concession and the French Concession are closely surrounded by a vast, disorganized area where thugs gather and law and order are non-existent. It is well known that the Municipal Council faces difficulties in handling affairs under these circumstances. This is undoubtedly true. (Reuters News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Hainan Island: Great Impact on Britain, France, and the United States; Hong Kong's Economy First to Suffer</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese army landed troops on Hainan Island at 4:00 AM on the 10th of this month, as previously reported. However, this move by the Japanese has enormous international implications. Further details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hainan Island is the only large island in southern China, with an area of approximately 100,000 square *li* and a population of about four million. Seventy percent of the population is Han Chinese, and thirty percent are indigenous people (the Li people). The Han Chinese reside in coastal areas, while the Li people live in the deep mountains. Some of the Li have assimilated with the Han Chinese, while others maintain a primitive lifestyle, engaging in farming and hunting. The island's climate is mild, with no cold winds even in winter, due to its tropical location and the moderating influence of sea breezes. The weather is pleasant year-round, neither too hot nor too humid. The Wuzhi Mountain range is located in the center of the island, with its highest peak rising 5,000 feet above sea level. The southern part of the island is mountainous, while the northern part is relatively flat. The northern part is separated from the Leizhou Peninsula by a narrow strait, with frequent shipping traffic, resulting in thriving commerce, and a comparatively developed economy and culture. The southern and central parts of the island are isolated due to transportation difficulties, and everything is exceptionally backward. The island is rich in resources, with abundant fishing and salt production, as well as natural mineral deposits. Timber, coconuts, betel nuts, rubber trees, and coffee are also produced in abundance, comparable to Southeast Asia. The island also has several natural deep-water ports around its perimeter, such as Lingao Port, Qinglan Port, Maniao Port, and Yulin Port, which can serve as both commercial and military ports. Therefore, Japan's coveting of the island did not begin today. However, the island's strategic position as the sole passage for British Far East shipping routes and a protective screen for French Anfu (Annam) made it inaccessible to Japan. After the Japanese army invaded South China, Britain and France (especially France) stated that they would not allow the Japanese army to occupy Hainan Island. Initially, it was unexpected that the Japanese army would disregard the protests of Britain and France and resolutely land troops. The reason why the Japanese army dares to invade Hainan Island today can be found in the European situation. In short, France is currently constrained by Italy and Germany in military terms due to the setbacks of the Spanish government forces. Britain, being cautious and prudent, constantly retreats and makes concessions. Japan, as an ally of Italy and Germany, seizes the opportunity to invade Hainan Island. Although Britain and France are threatened, they can do nothing. Therefore, the unfolding of the Hainan Island war situation has a great impact on Britain, France, and the United States. The actions of the Japanese army may escalate tensions in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Hainan Island are quite close, and their economic relationship is very close. Most of Hainan's various products are exported to Hong Kong, and the daily necessities of the millions of people on Hainan Island are supplied by Hong Kong. At the same time, Hong Kong is densely populated, and a significant amount of its grain and vegetables come from Hainan. Therefore, trade between Hong Kong and Hainan has always been very developed. Since the fall of Guangzhou, Hong Kong's trade has plummeted. Foreign goods are stored in warehouses and cannot be transported to the mainland. Although the demand for mainland products exceeds the supply, there is nothing that can be done. However, trade between Hong Kong and Hainan remained as usual. Now that war has broken out on the island, Hong Kong's commerce will suffer another blow. The Hainanese people residing in Hong Kong mostly make a living by engaging in import and export trade. The Lunar New Year is approaching, and the outbreak of war means that goods scheduled for shipment cannot be delivered on time, and outstanding accounts cannot be settled. The extent of the losses is difficult to estimate. The cessation of shipments of pigs, cattle, and vegetables from Hainan to Hong Kong will also cause food shortages in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Chinese and Japanese Troops in Kangcun, Yuhang; Repeated Japanese Attacks Fail; Japanese Major Killed</h3>
<p>Yuhang Correspondence: At dawn on the 19th, the Chinese army's position in Kangcun, eight kilometers northwest of Yuhang, was attacked by the Yamada Unit of the Japanese army from Hangzhou. The Chinese army was engaged in training at the time. After hearing the report from the sentry, they ambushed along both sides of the road where the Japanese army was advancing. When the Japanese army had advanced deep enough, more than 200 Chinese soldiers suddenly surged up in one go. The Japanese army was unprepared and suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army then completely surrounded the Japanese army. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the Japanese army desperately wanted to escape, but it was already too late. They resisted stubbornly for a while, trying to break through, but ultimately failed due to a lack of strength and the young age of the soldiers. They were annihilated by the Chinese army's fierce attack. Chinese casualties were minimal. However, about a dozen innocent civilians were brutally murdered by Japanese soldiers. After the news of the defeat reached Hangzhou, the Japanese army dispatched a large force in the afternoon, advancing in four directions. The Chinese army had also received prior intelligence, so they immediately counterattacked. However, the Japanese army advanced with unusual ferocity, once charging towards the Chinese positions with machine guns and then firing sulfur guns at the village houses, attempting to disrupt the Chinese lines. However, the Chinese army's morale was exceptionally stable and continued to fight back. The Japanese army's plan failed again, and they attacked from the flanks, but also failed to make progress. It was said that the Japanese army used diversionary tactics, attacking three or four times, but ultimately failed. By this time, the sun was setting, and darkness enveloped the area. Fearing unfavorable conditions, the Japanese army planned to retreat, but the Chinese army ambushed them on their way back, attacking from both sides. Many Japanese soldiers abandoned their weapons and fled in disarray. In this battle, Chinese soldiers and civilians suffered heavy casualties, but the Japanese suffered even more. Japanese infantry Major Iino Masao was also killed by the Chinese army.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Goes to Shaozhou to Confer on Military Affairs; New Deployment of Anti-Japanese Forces on the Guangdong-Guangxi Border</h3>
<p>Guangxi Correspondence: According to intelligence obtained by the Guilin headquarters, the Japanese army has recently concentrated troops and warships in Sanshui and Tuanzhou, intending to attack Sihui, Guangning, and Zhaoqing on the one hand, and to land in the south to seize Beihai and Anpu on the other, in an attempt to open a route into Guangxi. If the Japanese attack Guangxi from Guangdong, they can only do so via the West River and the southern route. Therefore, the authorities have made new arrangements for the defense of the Guangdong-Guangxi border. Before flying to Chongqing from Guilin at the end of last month, Bai Chongxi, the director of the headquarters, passed through Hengyang and went to Shaozhou in northern Guangdong to meet with Zhang Fakui, the acting commander of the Fourth War Zone, and to summon corps commanders Ye Zhao, Li Hanhun, Wu Qiwei, and other senior generals to listen to their reports and hold a short but important meeting. They discussed and decided on several matters: 1. Determining the highest commanders for the four defensive lines in the east, south, west, and north. 2. Adjusting the guerrilla forces and people's self-defense forces on the four lines. 3. Coordinating communication between the battle lines and the supply and replenishment of all military materials. Bai stayed in Shaozhou for two days and then returned to the Guilin headquarters, boarded a plane to Chongqing, and reported in detail to the highest military leaders, and also participated in the Fifth Plenary Session. Bai then completed his duties in Chongqing and returned to Guilin via Kunming on the 6th of this month to deploy forces along the Guangdong-Guangxi border. The defense of the southern route, including Qinzhou and Lianzhou, is the sole responsibility of the Fifth Route Army. The Guilin headquarters has already appointed Wei Yunsong, a military commander of a certain army, as the commander of that route. Xia Wei, the chief of staff of the Fifth Route Army Headquarters, is the commander of the West River upstream defense line from Wuzhou to Zhaoqing. Liang Chaoji and Li Qi, the commanders of the Wuzhou and Yulin civil defense forces, are responsible for the reserve forces and rear transportation and supplies for the two lines. The Fourth War Zone Command is responsible for planning the northern and eastern Jiang defense lines in Guangdong Province. Although the Japanese army has been continuously reinforcing its troops, its plan seems to focus on consolidating the outer defense lines of Guangzhou, and a large-scale attack on Guangxi seems to be pending. Since the first of this month, for five or six consecutive days, the Chinese army on the upper reaches of the West River has had frequent minor skirmishes with the Japanese army entrenched at various points in Sanshui, Hekou, Makou, and Mafang. On the morning of the 4th, a Japanese team built a pontoon bridge from Makou West Bank to cross the West River towards Jinli Market, but it was shelled by a battalion of the Chinese army, destroying the pontoon bridge. More than a hundred Japanese soldiers drowned, and Major Kikawa of the Yoshida Regiment was also killed and his body was transported back to Foshan for cremation. Currently, both armies are shelling each other across the river at Makou and Mafang.</p>
<h3>Garrison Troops in Zhenhai Seize Smuggling Ship; Cunning Merchants Captured as Well</h3>
<p>Zhenhai Correspondence: The area around Longshan and Xiepu in northern Zhenhai is located on the coast, and sailboats frequently enter and exit, leading to rampant smuggling. Although the military and police authorities have made every effort to investigate and crack down, the cunning of the merchants is extremely sly. Yesterday, a certain battalion of the garrison troops stationed in the town seized a smuggling ship, fully loaded with smuggled Japanese goods, including cigarette paper. The cunning merchant, Chen Fengzhang, the manager of the Hengpai firm, was arrested, and a large quantity of the same Japanese goods was found in his home. Both the person and the goods were sent to the battalion headquarters. However, the case is complex, and a thorough investigation is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Crushed in Wuzhen; Xu Chunshan's Troops Defect; Japanese Captain Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Wuzhen Correspondence: The Japanese army entrenched in the southern sector of Wuzhen attempted to attack the Chinese army led by Zhu Xi, but hesitated to advance. The Japanese army in Hangzhou also posted notices in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, offering a reward of 50,000 yuan for the capture of Zhu Xi. They also stated that a reward of 5,000 yuan would be given for the destruction of a small Chinese army unit or the capture of a city. Unexpectedly, a part of Xu Chunshan's troops, under Xu Pucheng of the puppet pacification force, who were leading the Japanese army, understood the greater cause and secretly contacted the Chinese army. On the 17th, taking advantage of a large-scale attack by the Chinese army, they suddenly led their troops in a defection, shouting, "We are all Chinese, we must turn our guns around and fight the Japanese!" The shouts shook the sky, and the Japanese army was struck like a bolt from the blue, terrified and at a loss. The defecting puppet troops joined forces with the Chinese army to launch a counterattack, with bullets raining down and flesh and blood flying everywhere. The Chinese army's mortar teams and broadsword teams also displayed their bravery, charging towards the Japanese positions. One soldier personally killed six Japanese soldiers and made a heroic sacrifice. The Japanese positions faltered and retreated in disarray, with heavy casualties. A Japanese army lieutenant colonel, Nakamura, was killed on the spot. The Chinese army also captured a traitor named He (from Zhenze, graduated from a law and political science university and served as a Japanese military advisor), and seized a Japanese steamship and countless military supplies. Afterwards, many Korean ronin and Northeasterners were found among the Japanese corpses. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to recapture Xinji, Lianshi, Chongde, Zhouquan, Tongxiang, Shiwan, Tudian Temple, Ripi Bridge, Lutou, and other places. At the same time, the two units of Xu Chong and Zhu Yunqing, under Cheng Wanjun's puppet army, were also annihilated by the Chinese army. The puppet army's strongholds in Jiuguan and Hangjie, between Shuanglin and Nanxun, were completely recaptured. A small detachment of the Japanese army, numbering over two hundred, attempted to encircle the headquarters of the Chinese army in Xinshi from Baimatang, in order to contain the Chinese army's front-line operations. However, they were bravely repelled by over eighty soldiers of the Chinese army's garrison troops under Zhang Xingbai.</p>
<h3>A Puppet Reporter from Cheng Bao Captured and Executed; Head Displayed to the Public at the South Gate</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: Gao Xueqin, originally named Cao, from Ligang in the western Cheng district, over forty years old, was entrusted by the puppet self-government association to run the Xin Jiangyin puppet newspaper after Jiangyin was occupied by the Japanese army. Gao controlled the editorial policy and engaged in extortion, earning a substantial monthly income. In the middle of this month, Gao was sent by the puppet governor, He Peiyi, to propagandize puppet orders in Zhouyi, Beiguo, and other places in the eastern district. On his return, he was intercepted by the guerrilla forces near Qingyang while traveling on a Cheng-Xi small steamboat. He was handed over to the higher authorities and executed according to the regulations for punishing traitors. His head was sent to the Tianzhutang (Catholic Church) Qianmen outside the South Gate for public display, along with a written statement of his crimes. The local people in the city were extremely terrified upon hearing the news.</p>

<h3>The Puppet Regime's Slavish Education in Shanghai; Forced Japanese Language Instruction, Deletion of Gymnastics Class; Guerrilla Fighters Burned Down Puppet School Buildings</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government Education Bureau," it continued to implement the slavish education plan of the former puppet "Great Dao Municipal Government Social Bureau" in the urban area. However, the number of students was extremely small, and it was repeatedly subjected to unreasonable interference from certain parties. The students suffered in silence. The Pudong guerrillas destroyed the puppet "Great Dao Sixteenth Elementary School" building during the Lunar New Year holiday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Many Schools, Few Students</p>
<p>The puppet "Social Bureau" divided the city into Pudong, Gaoqiao, Nanshi, Zhabei, Wusong, Jiangwan, Hongkou, and other districts, each establishing puppet schools called "Great Dao Elementary Schools." Pudong and Nanshi had the largest number of schools, with over a hundred in the city. However, the urban population had decreased, and most parents were unwilling to send their children to these schools. Therefore, apart from a few children of hooligans, the students were mostly the children of officials of all ranks in the puppet organization. The number of students in each school ranged from ten to twenty.</p>
<p>Slavish Textbooks and Forced Japanese Language Instruction</p>
<p>The teachers and staff in the puppet schools were mostly those who could barely read and tell fortunes, lacking sufficient knowledge. Those with knowledge were unwilling to lose their conscience and do this work. The textbooks used were compiled by the puppet "Ministry of Education," and the content was based on the originally published textbooks from various bookstores, with all words about revolution, the Party-State flag, martyrs, and other nationalistic thoughts completely removed. They promoted their so-called "Royal Way" fallacy. Portraits of Sun Yat-sen in all schools were uniformly replaced with portraits of Confucius, and Japanese language instruction was forcibly imposed. The gymnastics class was deleted, proving that their intention was to prevent Chinese people from strengthening their bodies.</p>
<p>Frequent Interference by Thugs During Class</p>
<p>During class time in the puppet elementary schools, certain thugs would frequently enter the school under the pretext of visiting, either making fun of the students or verbally insulting the teachers. The teachers were forced to smile in the face of such power, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. Sometimes, they reported the situation to the puppet "Education Bureau," but it was not only fruitless, but they were also scolded for being nosy. Therefore, the schools kept silent about such matters thereafter.</p>
<p>Pudong Warriors Attack School Building</p>
<p>There was a "Great Dao Sixteenth Elementary School" in Pudong, which had a relatively large number of students. However, the principal was particularly obsequious to the Japanese and was very oppressive to the students. Whenever a teacher mentioned the word "Japanese" in class, he would order all the students to stand up and force them to post reactionary slogans. The guerrillas learned of this and, taking advantage of the school holiday during the Lunar New Year when the school was empty, immediately sent personnel to burn down the school building.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Wartime University Opens; Registration Deadline for Admissions is the End of This Month</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government established the Zhejiang Wartime University to cultivate specialized talent and meet the needs of the war effort, appointing a preparatory committee, organizing a preparatory committee, and designating Sanyan Temple in Lishui as the office, responsible for preparing everything, as previously reported. It is now learned that the committee held its second standing committee meeting on the 10th of this month, attended by Chairman Xu Shaodi, members Huang Zupei, Zhao Zengjue, and Mo Dingsen, and decided on the budget for the opening and equipment costs of each college, as well as other important cases. Since publishing a notice to survey students who have dropped out of school in various places, as a basis for opening classes and establishing departments, the committee has been receiving a great number of enthusiastic requests from those who have dropped out of school and who have filled out forms to register with the committee or designated locations. According to a responsible person from the committee, the university plans to first establish the College of Engineering, the College of Agriculture, and the College of Medicine. The College of Engineering will be located in Lishui and will temporarily be divided into three departments: Physics and Chemistry, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and Civil Engineering. The College of Agriculture will be located in Songyang and will temporarily be divided into two departments: Agronomy and Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine. The College of Medicine will be located in Linhai and will be reorganized from the provincial medical and pharmaceutical college, with two departments: Medicine and Pharmacy. The length of study for each college and department, except for the College of Medicine, which is five years, is four years. Tuition fees will be waived. This semester, it is planned to recruit first-year freshmen and transfer students at all levels and conduct centralized training, focusing on life skills and basic academic exercises. Formal class placement will take place in the next semester. The enrollment regulations will be determined and announced after the survey and registration are completed. It is hoped that students who have dropped out of school in various places and wish to study at the university will fill out the form and submit it for registration by the end of February so that comprehensive planning can be carried out and classes can be opened accordingly.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Education Circle: Opinions on Reforming Education; Opinions on Improving China's Normal School Education (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wu Zengjie</p>
<p>Establishing Standards for Normal School Students' Training: Regarding the cultivation of normal school students' moral character, the methods adopted by various schools in the past have varied due to different environments. In the future, the Ministry of Education should establish training goals and guidelines so that moral education in normal schools has a clear direction. Before formulating these standards, the Ministry of Education should solicit opinions from normal school authorities and elementary education experts, analyze the qualities of excellent elementary school teachers, and refer to the standards for civic training in elementary schools. The greatest purpose of normal school training is to make students role models for children, because the behavior and personality of elementary school teachers have a great impact on children. The indirect guidance of moral education in schools is more important than direct teaching. Therefore, "personality edification" is above all else. Teachers must be able to lead by example and exert a subtle influence. Only if normal school students have self-cultivation can they become excellent elementary school teachers.</p>
<p>Meeting the Practical Needs of Elementary Schools: The curriculum of normal schools should meet the needs of elementary schools. What is not needed by elementary schools can be deleted. Whether the current normal school curriculum standards meet the needs of elementary schools is still a question. For example, the teaching materials for biology, physics, and chemistry in normal schools focus on the subjects themselves, failing to consider the content of elementary school curriculum. Normal school students often find it difficult to teach because they lack the teaching materials needed by elementary schools. In the future, the normal school curriculum should be revised based on the elementary school curriculum standards in order to meet the practical needs of elementary schools and ensure that normal school students have sufficient qualifications to become elementary school teachers.</p>
<p>The above four points are my personal opinions on improving normal school education. Whether they are appropriate or not, I hope experts will discuss and correct them.</p>
<h3>School Overview: Su Min Vocational School</h3>
<p>Su Min Vocational School was founded by vocational education experts Yang Weiyu and Pan Yangyao, industrialists Wu Yun Chu and Fang Jiangge, and other enthusiastic educators. Originally located in Nanxiang Town on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line, it covered an area of over sixty acres. The school originally had nearly a thousand students, including the elementary school, and was a well-known school in the mainland. Provincial and county school inspectors repeatedly inspected the school, considering it to be diligently run with excellent results. In memory of the late educator Mr. Xu Sumin, it was named "Su Min." It was previously registered with the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and filed with the National Government's Ministry of Education. After the "August 13th" Incident, due to environmental concerns, approval was obtained from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and reported to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to relocate to Shanghai. By the summer of last year, it had rented the Siming Bank Building on Nanjing Road as its school building. In addition to cooperating with the China Vocational Education Society to run the Fifth China Vocational Supplementary School (which currently has 1,500 students), the elementary school was also restarted.</p>
<p>The school currently offers both junior commercial and civil engineering programs, each with three levels, all designed for three-year graduation. There are currently 200 students. The elementary school has six levels, with over 300 students. Due to space limitations, each class has a fixed quota. At the beginning of this semester, no fewer than several hundred applicants were turned away due to full enrollment, demonstrating the high regard Shanghai residents have for the school. In terms of equipment, the business department has eight Chinese and English typewriters, and the civil engineering department has state-of-the-art theodolites, levels, plane tables, and other valuable instruments for practical surveying exercises. Other applied teaching aids and experimental supplies are also selectively purchased. The current school building is a four-story Western-style building, with the school occupying the second, third, and fourth floors, totaling twenty-four rooms. There is also a rooftop sports field for student recreation. As for the school's educational philosophy, it adheres to its past spirit, emphasizing practicality and avoiding superficial extravagance. The curriculum strives to be relevant and practical, with serious teaching and strict management. Chairman Pan Yangyao is currently the Director of the Shanghai Office of the China Vocational Education Society and Secretary of the Four-Bank Savings Association. Principal Lu Sheren holds a Bachelor of Education degree from Great China University and has served as principal and teacher in various primary and secondary schools for many years. All faculty and staff are graduates of well-known domestic universities and specialized schools, possessing extensive knowledge and experience. Therefore, graduates of the school are well-prepared for further education or employment. It is said that the previous two graduating classes of the business department are mostly employed in the industrial and commercial sectors or have entered well-known high schools. As for the civil engineering students, many go to work in the mainland, and some have been admitted to the National Land Surveying School. The school maintains the simple and frugal academic atmosphere of the mainland. Male students all have short hair, and female students are not allowed to perm or wear makeup. In warm weather, everyone wears short attire, and in cold weather, they wear blue cloth long gowns. The tuition and fees are also lower than other schools, with middle school tuition at sixteen yuan and elementary school ranging from ten to twelve yuan. Preferential treatment is also offered to poor students and students from war zones.</p>
<h3>Sports News: The Helsinki Olympic World Games: Nineteen Nations Have Reported Participation; China Will Participate in the Marathon and Race Walking; Chongqing's Sports Atmosphere is Booming, Participation is Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>(London Dispatch) Nineteen countries have indicated their intention to participate in the Olympic World Games to be held in Helsinki, Finland in 1940. The latest to accept the invitation were the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. Norway has decided not to participate in the gymnastics competition. The United States will send 250 athletes to participate in both the summer and winter Olympic Games (the Winter World Games will be held in St. Moritz, Switzerland). Approximately 50 track and field athletes will be sent, compared to 68 in the previous games. Other important events for the US and Canada include boxing, wrestling, swimming, and fencing. The American Athletic Association has passed a resolution to expand its promotion of the World Games and raise funds for participation. (Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing Dispatch) Chongqing's sports scene has recently been vibrant. The Ministry of Education has decided to participate in the 1940 World Games in Helsinki. In terms of ball sports, athletes will be selected for football and basketball (although there is no basketball in this year's World Games). Participation in track and field is planned to be abandoned. However, the results of the marathon and race walking in the previous games were still quite impressive, and personnel will be sent to perform. During the Sixth National Sports Conference convened here by the Ministry of Education, more than 40 attendees, including Yuan Dunli, Wu Yunrui, Cheng Dengke, and Jiang Xiangqing, resolved that school sports must be included in the entrance examination. Students who fail sports will not be able to graduate. Physical education teachers in various schools must be graduates of physical education colleges. Social sports with excellent results may be reported by the local competent authorities to the Ministry of Education for the issuance of honorary medals. In order to arouse citizens' interest in sports, the Ministry of Education has specifically scheduled a Chongqing Open Cross-Country Race and Bicycle Race on the 26th of this month. Participation is extremely enthusiastic, foreshadowing an unprecedented grand event here.</p>
<h3>Lido Eliminated Yuanchang Yesterday: Won the Junior Cup Final; 1-1 in the First Half, Result 5-1; Group C, Survey Team Forfeited to the Park Alliance</h3>
<p>The junior cup football semi-final between Lido and Yuanchang took place at Jiaozhou Park yesterday at 3 PM. The referee was Shen Huichun, and there were over 600 spectators. Lido's main players, Sun Jinshun and Xu Wenkui, were not present, and they were replaced by Jiang Chao and Rong Zhong, greatly reducing their strength. The Yuanchang players calmly fought back, and they were evenly matched with Lido, ending the first half with a score of 1-1. After switching sides, Lido launched a major offensive and scored four more goals, resulting in a 5-1 victory. At the beginning of the game, Yuanchang's Li Songjun committed a foul and was immediately awarded a penalty kick, which was taken by Li Yichen. It hit the crossbar and bounced back, and Lido missed a good opportunity. After eight minutes, Li Yichen led the attack and passed the ball forward, which Jiang Chao kicked into the goal, opening the scoring. After that, it fell into a chaotic battle, and both sides stalemated. Although each side had chances to score, they failed to capitalize. After 35 minutes, Shen Shangde hooked the ball in, Zheng Tongyu failed to stop it, and Cao Qin Fang rushed in and shot into the empty goal, tying the score. The first half ended 1-1, with no winner. When the second half started, Lido tried to rally and launched a strong attack. After 10 minutes, Yuanchang's Zhang Xianlun accidentally handled the ball, and Tan Fuzhen scored a penalty kick. Yuanchang was defeated and fell into decline. Five minutes later, Zhang Mingsheng kicked a corner kick, and Jiang Chao volleyed the ball into the net, making it 3-1. Finally, Li Yichen scored two more goals, and the time ended, and Lido eliminated Yuanchang with a score of 5-1 and won the final. Another Group C game between the Park Alliance and the Survey Team was held yesterday. The Survey Team was unable to attend and declared a forfeit. The Park Alliance won without lifting a finger. The formations for yesterday's game are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Bank Basketball League: Salt Industry Lodged a Protest Letter</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Game Against Zhejiang Xingye</p>
<p>Insufficient Playing Time</p>
<p>The Bank Basketball League continued during the Lunar New Year. Yesterday at 11 AM, the Salt Industry Team played against the Zhejiang Xingye Team at Hongyi Middle School on Jing'an Temple Road. The two teams had previously played a friendly match, and their strengths were equal. Yesterday, the Salt Industry players performed worse, perhaps due to the New Year, and the result was 31-12.

<p>Weekly Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation: Clothing Special</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Clothing</h3>
<p>— Water Bird</p>
<p>In this 20th-century era, a leader's attire does not require as much decoration as in the old feudal times. Chairman Chiang embodies this 20th-century style perfectly. He usually wears Zhongshan suits, Chinese suits, or simple military uniforms. It is rare to see him wearing a Western suit; I have only seen him wear one in his wedding photograph. He seems to have worn Japanese clothing during his youth when he studied in Japan. During the National Scout Grand Review a couple of years ago, Chairman Chiang wore the full dress uniform of a special-grade general for the first time, which was arguably his most magnificent attire. In ordinary times, his clothing is extremely civilian. When reading in his study, he wears a tattered summer linen gown in summer and an old silk-padded robe in winter. His favorite clothing color is snuff brown, and he prefers clean fabrics, absolutely rejecting imported goods and favoring domestic products. Once, Mr. Ma Guoliang and a friend of his went to a tailor shop and accidentally saw a piece of white linen fabric on the table. A small tag next to it read "One piece of fabric for Chairman Chiang." A measurement card was attached. This discovery aroused his curiosity, and the shopkeeper told him that their shop was originally in Nanjing and moved to Hankou after Nanjing fell. Chiang's clothes have always been made by them. He also said, "None of Chairman Chiang's ordinary clothes ever cost more than forty yuan." Such a simple life is rare among leaders in the world today. At the same time, compared to some people in our country who spend twenty or thirty yuan on a pair of socks or shoes, it is truly commendable!</p>
<h3>1939 Spring Fashion Designs</h3>
<p>— Cangqi</p>
<h3>Clothing Purchase Guide</h3>
<p>— Huanjun</p>
<p>Before tailoring a garment, to prevent the material from shrinking later, it is necessary to soak it in water first. This refers to the cloth itself. To ensure that silk and wool fabrics maintain their bright and beautiful colors, they cannot be soaked in water, so they can only be sprayed with water. Ordinary people often leave the job of spraying water to the tailor, but tailors often skim off the fabric. If it shrinks after spraying, there will not be much extra. So relying on the tailor to spray water is not reliable; it is best to buy a spray bottle and do it yourself, which is more reliable and worry-free.</p>
<p>When wearing a fancy new robe, the collar is always the first part to get dirty, no matter what. Nowadays, young people wear their hair long, oily, and black, making the collar especially prone to getting dirty. Isn't it a pity that a garment costing twenty yuan or so loses its appearance due to the collar, even though the color is still bright? (Oil stains on the collar are difficult to remove even by dry cleaners, and after cleaning, the color is never as bright as it was originally). So when I buy a garment, I always tell the tailor to cut an extra collar and keep it. When the original collar gets dirty, I can replace it with a new one, and it will still look beautiful and clean, right?</p>
<h3>Crochet Cheongsam</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The wheels of time are constantly progressing, and the new contributions of material enjoyment are changing with each passing day! The popularity of crochet fabrics has a long history of decades, and its prevalence has remained constant. In recent years, Chinese and Western crochet products compete to show their unique qualities. Some are excellent in color and texture, while others excel in twisting. The types and styles of crochet are also constantly innovating and changing. Initially, there were only a few simple woven items such as gloves, shoes, socks, vests, and shirts and trousers. Now, with the clever minds and diligent hands of women, shawls, coats, vests, scarves, children's hats, and other items can be turned into very novel and delicate products. The softness and beauty of crochet symbolize the gentleness and beauty of women. Crochet is a sweet companion for young ladies and mothers, and this is true.</p>
<p>Ms. Shen Lin, director of the Lili Knitting Studio, told me that she has a new contribution from 1939—a crochet cheongsam. With a crochet vest and a crochet cheongsam, it is like a lotus emerging from water, even more charming. Moreover, it is as light and warm as fur, and the style is novel. She also said that women's skin tones, figures, and styles are all different. If they are matched with a "crochet cheongsam" of a suitable color, they will have a unique charm. (The author notes that the Lili Studio is located at 1044 Yuwei Road).</p>

<h3>How to Preserve Clothes</h3>
<p>— Xie Tianshen</p>
<p>Clothing is a tool for humans to protect their bodies, and it has a close relationship with appearance, etiquette, and hygiene. We must use cleanliness and beauty as the standard when wearing clothes. To maintain cleanliness and beauty, we must pay attention at all times. In addition to washing, we must also preserve clothes to ensure that the materials and colors can be used for a long time without damage. This is not only an important duty of housewives but also knowledge that everyone should have.</p>
<p>The important reasons why clothes last a long time are: first, the material is strong, the color does not fade, and the sewing is fine; second, the preservation is proper.</p>
<p>If clothes are stained with dirt, wash them immediately to keep them clean. Undershirts, socks, and bedding must be washed frequently, because the dirt on these items is not contaminated by other objects, but is composed of sweat and dust. If these dirt are not washed for a long time, mold spots will appear in the dirty areas. Because mold spots contain moisture, they are very likely to damage the quality of the clothes, and the color may fade. Therefore, preserving clothes requires diligent washing.</p>
<p>After wearing clothes, take them off and hang them in direct sunlight to dry. Because clothes absorb moisture from the air and moisture from the body, after being exposed to the hot sun, the moisture will also dissipate, so that they can be dried and will not mold. Clothes that are not often worn should be taken out and dried on dry days every year. Woolen and leather clothing should be taken out and dried from time to time. It is best to dry them in the autumn, and it is also possible in spring and winter. The air contains a lot of moisture in summer, which easily transmits moisture. Direct sunlight can easily fade the colors of brightly colored clothes, so this should be noted.</p>
<p>Place camphor powder or balls in clothing chests or cabinets. Its function can keep them dry and prevent insect infestation. It is best to use expensive, high-quality clothing chests and cabinets, because they can prevent moisture from entering. Paulownia wood chests are best at resisting moisture, because the wood will swell when it encounters moisture, making it difficult for moisture to penetrate. Therefore, chests and cabinets made of paulownia wood are best for storing clothes. If you want to prevent insects, you can use camphor oil or pepper decoction to smear in the gaps to avoid insect infestation.</p>
<p>Clothing chests and cabinets should be placed in a dry place. If the home is located downstairs, it must be raised with wooden frames or sleepers to prevent it from being affected by moisture.</p>
<p>All clothes that are to be stored must be washed clean. If there are clothes that are inconvenient to wash, you can wash them with gasoline and then dry them. All valuables can be wrapped in bundles or parchment paper and then stored.</p>
<h3>Fashion Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Do Not Ask</p>
<p>People living in Shanghai pay considerable attention to clothing. What is the reason for this? It can be expressed with a common saying: "Buddha relies on gold, man relies on clothes," valuing clothes more than people!</p>
<p>Wearing four ounces on the body, burning pomegranate seeds at home. Shanghai people are particular about clothing, so there are more tailor shops than cigarette paper shops. However, Shanghai tailor shops never use the words "Shanghai" to advertise themselves; instead, they use "Su Guang" (Jiangsu and Guangdong) as their unique trademark. A friend who had just arrived in Shanghai was surprised to see "Su Guang Tailor Shop" signs everywhere and exclaimed, "What? Is the business of Su Guang tailors so developed? There are so many branches!" In fact, after Shanghai opened as a port, the most people who came were from Jiangsu and Guangdong. The Guangdong style is unique, so there are separate Guangdong tailors occupying a position. Others, such as those from Ningbo and Shaoxing, are not few in number. However, their clothing is similar to the Jiangsu style, so Jiangsu tailors also occupy a very widespread position. At that time, only Guangdong tailors could go their own way and differ from the Jiangsu style. Later, due to this historical relationship, all Shanghai tailor shops had to add the words "Su Guang" to be qualified for recognition.</p>
<p>Jiangsu tailors had considerable influence in early Shanghai because they often came up with novel ideas and styles to offer to customers who were particular about clothing. Several people who were noticed by society wore new styles of clothing and took a stroll, and then everyone imitated them, creating a trend and being praised for being fashionable. A Western proverb says, "Those who like to dress up are the toys of tailors," which seems to be mocking the fashion in Shanghai. It was said that the most novel women's clothing at that time was worn by courtesans, so they held the authority on clothing. Respectable women, obsessed with fashion, were not ashamed to mix imitation jade with real jade, willingly dressing like them in order to meet the conditions for being fashionable. Later, the thinking of courtesans gradually lagged behind, unable to keep up with the times and progress with each passing day. At the same time, many socialites, movie stars, and dancers emerged to take over the authority of clothing because their clothes imitated Europe and America, combining health with gracefulness, and the styles were new and not old-fashioned. Not only were they admirable for their daily changes, but they also had changes happening from dawn to dusk, thus becoming the most modern model for women's clothing, which laid the foundation for "fashion." As a result, "fashion" companies emerged. The so-called "fashion" is completely European and American in style, which cannot be manipulated by Jiangsu and Guangdong tailors. Therefore, the influence of Su Guang tailoring almost collapsed. Fortunately, several clever "Su Guang" tailors tried hard to adopt European styles and change to new methods, improving a size chart by dividing the upper, middle, and lower parts into several stages, measuring the size to the nearest fraction, daring not to be careless. Therefore, even now, the fate of "Su Guang" tailor shops can still survive precariously. However, for wedding dresses, banquet dresses, dancing dresses, swimming attire, overcoats, and coats, one must patronize fashion companies. Su Guang tailor shops can only sigh in despair!</p>
<p>Clothing, food, and housing are three necessities of life, and "clothing" comes first, which shows that the importance of clothing in life really surpasses food and housing. In ancient times, scholars were called "dressed gentlemen," and ceremonial caps and ribbons were all the clothing of officials, so descendants were also called "ceremonial hats and ribbons." Ouyang Xiu said, "Clothing covers the multitude, providing for all things," referring to the meaning of benevolence and righteousness spreading throughout the world. Buddhist monks and disciples are collectively called "robe and bowl." Novels often describe the dynamics of boudoirs with the phrase "fragrant clothes and shadowed hairpins." Being rich and not returning to one's hometown is satirized as "wearing brocade to travel at night." This is the poison of feudal thought, so do not imitate it. The common saying is, "Brothers are like hands and feet, husband and wife are like clothes." Clothes can always be changed for something new, so husband and wife can always get divorced, which shows that traditional Chinese thought has long implicitly recognized the possibility of divorce. However, it is deeply hoped that future couples will never again use "clothing" to describe the way of husband and wife; otherwise, it is not contagion or silent transformation, but being greatly deceived by the ancients.</p>
<p>Mencius said, "Even if someone bares his arms and body beside me, how can he defile me?" The meaning is that exposing arms and bodies is an impolite act, but it cannot defile Mencius. "Tan" means rolling up sleeves to expose arms; "xi" means rolling up sleeves to expose fur; "luo" means being naked; "cheng" means being stark naked. At present, women's fashion cuts off the sleeves, almost exposing their armpits, which is not surprising. In dance halls, grass skirts and pajamas are used as an attractive gimmick. This stage is even more extreme than "tan," "xi," "luo," and "cheng," so it anesthetizes the masses, piercing through to the top, no wonder general dancers rush to it in alarm.</p>

<p>Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Education Group Special Issue for Raising Funds for Refugee Production and Education</p>
<h3>The Importance of Refugee Production and Education</h3>
<p>— Ni Fengmei</p>
<p>The promotion of refugee relief work by all sectors of the city can truly be described as making every effort. It began with large-scale accommodation, providing clothing and food, then vigorously implementing thrift and sharing weal and woe, and finally promoting production and education, from passive to active, and carrying out construction and remediation after destruction, so that human and material resources are no longer wasted in the slightest, in order to invisibly enhance the country, which can be said to be a major progress in our arduous journey.</p>
<p>In the past, what we called refugee relief was mostly based on charitable donations, and its purpose was only to provide relief. Those in charge of it were also regarded or regarded themselves as having boundless merit. However, the nature of what is called refugee relief today is completely different. Why are there so many refugees within the country? We should first recognize the reasons for its creation, and then we will know that our relief to our compatriots in distress is not only based on a sense of humanity, but there are more important factors in between. Only in this way can the compatriots in distress, although relying on relief to survive, also consider how to benefit the country and the nation, and not just live in vain.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have the necessity to make refugees engage in production. Today, the general opinion is that there is no good way to improve the lives of refugees other than relief. The so-called production is also afraid of being nominal and not real, outweighing the gains, or that relief to refugees has been going on for more than a year, why not consider it earlier? In addition, the city's industrial and production machinery has suffered from destruction, and imported goods are supplied to maintain difficulties. How can we start to promote it to achieve satisfactory results? We are not unaware of the magnitude and difficulty of this work, but transforming the situation and overcoming the environment are precisely what every citizen should practice today. Only by facing complex problems can we see sharp tools. Therefore, we can use this opportunity to use collective wisdom and strength to implement the principle of those with money contributing money and those with strength contributing strength, and lay a solid foundation for the permanent self-sufficiency of people's livelihood and daily necessities. If machinery is destroyed, our country's highly developed handicraft industry can rise to replace it. If foreign goods are expensive and supply is insufficient, then domestic goods can be produced in large quantities to fill the gap. How can we see that refugees cannot engage in production and that production plans cannot be put into practice? Moreover, in addition to cherishing material resources and developing the economy, we must make refugees work hard, exercise their bodies, and unify their will to prepare for the struggle for survival. In this era of great torrents, a group of citizens who are full all day and do nothing are definitely not allowed.</p>
<p>Second, it is necessary to educate them. The number of illiterates in our country is unparalleled in the world, so education is particularly important in our country. Educating refugees is not only to eliminate illiteracy, but also to shoulder the responsibility of cultivating healthy citizens. Our country today is concentrating all human and material resources to seek the final survival. Refugee production is a part of mobilizing material resources, and educating refugees is to make them understand the meaning of this nation-building and know how to be loyal to the country. At the very least, all the new social education goals set by the country must be made clear to them. We should know that good citizens educated in refugee life are of greater significance and educational value. We should also know that education and production are related. Promoting refugee production through educational methods can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Today, the city's education sector has taken the lead in raising funds for refugee production and education. I know that this movement will surely touch the sympathy of the vast majority of people. Although success depends on the strength of the masses, advocacy must start from oneself. When the wind blows, the grass bends, and there will be success as long as there is initiative. I hope that teachers and students in the city's education sector will take on the responsibility bravely and achieve success quickly.</p>
<h3>Abolishing the Lunar New Year and Fundraising</h3>
<p>Abolishing the Lunar New Year is a happy day. All industries are closed, and everyone seeks some happiness. In order to seek happiness, spending money is naturally more than usual. Lao Tzu said: "The way of heaven, is it not like stretching a bow?" Stretching but not relaxing makes life feel painful. One stretch and one relaxation are enough to restore tired spirits. For the sake of the body and for the sake of the career, it is appropriate. Although we are facing a great disaster and wailing can be heard everywhere, finding joy in suffering is to increase the spirit of struggle and extend the time of struggle. Seeking happiness during the New Year is not entirely blameworthy.</p>
<p>However, in extraordinary times, leisure is different from prosperous times. Simply seeking happiness is a bit suspicious of decadence, and truly patriotic people certainly do not want this. The best way is to seek happiness while not forgetting the current disaster. In concrete terms, it is to propose a part of the entertainment expenses to be used for disaster relief. Enjoying without forgetting disaster relief is called joy without excess. Disaster relief without forgetting enjoyment is called sorrow without injury. Joy without excess is righteousness, and sorrow without injury is courage. Isn't it the best attitude in life to have both righteousness and courage? Promoting refugee education and increasing refugee production is the unshirkable heavenly duty of disaster relief for us Shanghai people. During this abolished Lunar New Year, everyone save some entertainment expenses to do this good deed. The spirit of "treating the people as my compatriots" is completely expressed through action. This is a meaningful and valuable move. From a personal point of view, this shows the attitude of life. From the perspective of the entire Shanghai, this shows the demeanor of a great citizen. Saving some New Year entertainment expenses to harvest these two major effects, everyone just needs to use a calm mind and think carefully, and everyone will be happy to agree.</p>
<p>As for the education sector and young people in Shanghai, everyone believes that thinking is relatively advanced. It is appropriate to use the abolished Lunar New Year to save entertainment expenses and use them for refugee education and production, using actions to arouse social sympathy, and creating a very strong atmosphere throughout Shanghai with the words "If I don't save the refugees, who will?" Such education circles and young people deserve to be called the advanced education circles and advanced young people!</p>
<p>A Public Letter to the Social Community regarding Fundraising for Refugee Education and Production Expenses</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Municipal Refugee Relief Association, we have been deeply admired by the enthusiasm of the social community to share their hunger and thirst, and the sympathy of mutually sharing clothing and food, so that more than 100,000 refugees who have been wandering in the city have no fear of freezing and hunger. However, although this passive work has achieved considerable results, active work such as education and production has not yet begun. The education and cultural circles have recently launched a fundraising movement for refugee education and production expenses. Among the refugees in the city's various shelters, there are more than 60,000 adults and more than 30,000 children. In the past, they were all self-sufficient citizens, but now they have suffered hardships due to the war and are barely surviving in the shelters. They have little opportunity for education and lack productive skills. If this continues for a long time, they will only be consumers and illiterates, and the impact is unimaginable. The colleagues in the education and cultural circles feel unbearable and are deeply worried. They love the principle of pooling wisdom and strength and jointly plan the righteous act of those with money contributing money, and launch a fundraising movement for education and production expenses, with a temporary goal of 100,000 yuan. It is deeply hoped that all schools and social people will rise up together and promote each other, so that the refugee education and production plan can be realized as soon as possible, so that refugee children will not be deprived of education, and refugee adults will have productive skills to be self-sufficient. Those who donate one yuan will be given a commemorative badge from the Refugee Relief Association, and additional reward measures will be set. Schools and students with excellent fundraising results will be given a plaque of merit by the Association to promote benevolence. However, this movement intends to obtain the most satisfactory results in the shortest possible time and achieve the best harvest with the most economical methods. Therefore, what is imagined must be announced to the social community, including the following: This movement is being launched during the Lunar New Year, and folk customs often include banquets and New Year greetings. Students can take the opportunity to donate the money earned from candy fees and New Year's money to refugee production and education expenses. Individuals can save unnecessary extravagance, and society can carry out effective undertakings. It is the greatest good to take advantage of the opportunity. As for fundraising from the outside world or public places, it is not adopted by the Association, because it not only affects the academic course but also relates to the order of the concession and the safety of students. This is the first thing that should be declared to the social community. The Association's fundraising this time is purely based on the purpose of voluntary assistance. The social community has different degrees of wealth, and the economic situation of the students is naturally different. Therefore, the amount that a school's students can donate should never be forced. It is hoped that everyone will embrace the world with kindness and donate as much as they can to gather strength and achieve complete success. This is the second thing that should be declared to the social community. Finally, I would like to add a word to the education community, that is, although the city's education community has made efforts to promote refugee relief in the past, a small part has failed to do their best, which has caused some disappointment in public opinion. The education community is the forerunner of society, and society expects a lot. According to common sense, this should not have happened. Now that there is a general mobilization of refugee education and production expenses, it is hoped that people in the education community will quickly catch up and establish a reputation that will not fall. The results are the touchstone of our education community's enthusiasm for charitable undertakings. If all can participate, then our entire education community can be shown to society, so that our entire education community will be exempted from unexpected accusations. This is the third thing that should be declared to the social community. Now that the fundraising movement is about to be launched, I dare to hope with a sincere heart that the social community will give it enthusiastic sympathy, so that these more than 100,000 refugees will have the opportunity for production and education in addition to ensuring their livelihood, which is fortunate.</p>

<h3>The Japanese side lodged a written protest yesterday regarding the terrorist incident. It was delivered to the Bureau of Public Works yesterday afternoon. The police force in the Concession is sufficient and there is no reason to criticize it.</h3>
<p>In the Huaxi area of this port, due to the erratic comings and goings of miscellaneous people from the Chinese community, cases of armed killings have occurred repeatedly. Although the Public Concession authorities have a police force to ensure the security of the Concession, due to the proximity of the extra-territorial roads of Huaxi to the Chinese community, they are unable to fully clear up such cases because they are limited by the Chinese community and cannot cooperate in preventing them in practice. However, the Public Concession Police Department still upholds its past spirit and tries its best to maintain law and order within the Concession.</p>
<p>Using the Chen case to make wild accusations</p>
<p>Since Chen Lu, the pseudo "Foreign Minister of the Reformed Government," was killed, the Japanese side has exaggerated its accusations in every possible way. Japanese personnel in Tokyo and Shanghai have issued various strong statements in the name of curbing so-called "terrorism" cases. However, Chen Lu's assassination was carried out by people entering and leaving the Chinese community. In order to achieve its long-held wishes, the Japanese side, represented by Consul Miura stationed in Shanghai, lodged its "protest" with the Concession authorities.</p>
<p>The Japanese side lodged a written protest yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Modern News Agency, after a series of shooting cases occurred in the Concession, Japanese Consul General Miura visited Fenkling, the chairman of the Bureau of Public Works, twice, blaming the Concession's police force for being weak and insufficient to maintain law and order. He also submitted a written protest to the Bureau of Public Works at 3:00 PM yesterday. The content of the wording is unknown to the outside world. It is reported that the Japanese side believes that the Concession police authorities have not made every effort to prevent and take harsh measures in the past shooting cases, and therefore should bear the responsibility. In addition, it also put forward two reservations, requesting a large increase in the number of Japanese police officers so that the Japanese side can fully cooperate with the police authorities to maintain law and order; the Japanese armed forces have the right to take direct action in the Concession area when necessary. It is said that this written protest was issued after consultation between Tokyo and Shanghai. The attitude of the Bureau of Public Works will be decided after consideration, and then a reply will be given, or it is intended to report to the consular corps first to decide everything.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Bureau of Public Works is also paying considerable attention to this matter. Yesterday afternoon, senior officials slightly mentioned it in private, which is said to be out of concern for their duties.</p>
<p>Complex content with no new discoveries</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that when a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy received reporters last night (21st), a reporter asked whether the Japanese authorities had received a reply from Japanese Consul General Miura regarding the protest he lodged with Fenkling, the chairman of the Bureau of Public Works, due to the atrocities that occurred in the Public Concession on Sunday. The spokesman replied that Miura had met with Mr. Fan, but the content of such cases was complex, and he was unwilling to discuss them at present. The matter is currently under study. When asked whether the Japanese authorities intended to take military action in the Public Concession, the spokesman replied that he could not provide any information on this point at present. The spokesman also detailed the circumstances of Chen Lu's death, saying that there were no new discoveries in addition to the reports. The Police Department of the Bureau of Public Works has arrested several people in connection with the case and is cooperating with the Japanese military police.</p>
<p>The police force in the Concession is very sufficient</p>
<p>According to foreign sources obtained by the Modern News Agency, the Concession authorities have been doing their best to maintain law and order since the Shanghai war, and the results can be said to be the best. The police force is very strong. For example, there are about 4,000 Chinese police officers, and there are more than 2,000 Western, Japanese, Indian, and other police officers, for a total of more than 6,600 people, which is more than enough to deal with all emergencies. In addition, there are more than 2,000 members of the International Volunteer Corps, including the ABC three major teams, machine gun teams, air defense teams, White Russian teams, etc., who can be mobilized to take action in the event of an incident. In addition, there are British and American defense forces to provide assistance. Therefore, the efforts of the Concession authorities to maintain law and order are really beyond reproach. The fact that general traitors and Japanese puppet figures have fled to the Concession because they cannot withstand the attacks of the guerrillas in the interior is enough to prove that the prevention in the interior is far less serious and thorough than that in the Concession. The Japanese side's accusation that the Concession's maintenance is ineffective this time is actually an excuse for its attempt to exert pressure. It is said that the Concession authorities are determined to uphold their past spirit, work hard to maintain law and order, and will not allow the Japanese side to criticize them.</p>
<h3>Money and Financial Businesses - Opening Today, Hongxiang and other Remittance and Money Shops Decide to Close Down, All Markets Open for Business Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The final accounting period for the 27th year of the Republic of China has passed. All businesses will fully open today. Money shops and money exchange stores will open simultaneously. Remittance shops such as Hongxiang have decided to close down. The money business association will hold a committee meeting to discuss new business guidelines. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Money Shops Open, Banks Resume Business</p>
<p>A total of forty-three money shops are members of the Money Business Association. Those opening for business must report to the association this morning and will distribute account books starting today. The association has scheduled an executive committee meeting for 2:00 PM on the 25th to discuss new business guidelines. The annual meeting will be held on March 3rd at the Money Business Association Hall in the northern part of the city, with a memorial service for past directors. The four money exchange stores, Fulushouxi, members of the Money Exchange Business Association, will also begin operations today. The association will hold an executive committee meeting, a New Year's dinner, and discuss business guidelines. Banks have completed their spring holiday and will resume business today.</p>
<p>Hongxiang and Other Shops Voluntarily Close</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency interviewed a leader in the money business yesterday. According to him, various industries in the Shanghai concessions developed abnormally last year, the 27th year of the Republic of China. All loans issued by the shops were recovered, so the businesses were doing well and able to make a slight profit. However, it is said that several remittance shops, including Hongxiang, decided to close down voluntarily because their shareholders had no intention of continuing. Also, certain other shops have completed their reorganization and will open as scheduled. A reporter also interviewed a member of the Money Exchange Business Association yesterday. According to him, the money exchange business is better after the war than before. Many new businesses have been established. Members previously in Hongkou have also moved south of the Suzhou Creek to operate.</p>
<p>Markets Open Today</p>
<p>After the general accounting period for all businesses, all preparations have been completed. Most will open for business today. Markets for soybeans, rice, money, money exchange, sugar, and miscellaneous grains will also open today. The informal stock, yarn, and flower exchanges will also resume trading at the same time. Yesterday was the fourth day of the first lunar month (commonly known as the day to welcome the God of Wealth). Old-style factories and businesses welcomed the God of Wealth, so many peddlers were selling "Wubao fish" (a type of dried fish) in the market. In addition, various shipping companies have resumed operations on all routes since the day before yesterday. Vessels that were docked in Shanghai for annual repairs will join their original routes as soon as the repairs are completed.</p>
<h3>Intimidation Tactics, Japanese Side Makes Empty Threats, Japanese Association Plans to Take Decisive Action, Japanese Army and Navy Hold Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the assassination of Chen Lu, the puppet "Foreign Minister of the Reformed Government," in an area outside the concessions, the Japanese side has seized the opportunity to protest to the Municipal Council. The Japanese residents in Shanghai have also added fuel to the fire, holding meetings to urge the Japanese authorities to take decisive action. However, the Municipal Council has taken a firm stance, and its police force is sufficient to maintain order. The Japanese side has no grounds for intervention. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Chen Lu Incident</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 21st), the Japanese-language Continental News published an article claiming that the puppet Foreign Minister Chen Lu of the "Reformed Government" was assassinated in the British defense zone. Therefore, the "Reformed Government" is gradually demanding that the British troops withdraw from their defense zone. The British authorities are trying to avoid acknowledging the responsibility of the "Reformed Government," claiming that they were not notified of Chen Lu's arrival in Shanghai. However, even though they do not recognize the "Reformed Government," it is only natural that they should pay special attention to and protect those holding important positions in the "Reformed Government." Using the excuse that they were not notified of Chen Lu's arrival in Shanghai to evade responsibility is equivalent to admitting that they are unable to maintain peace and order in their own defense zone.</p>
<p>Demanding the Arrest of the Culprits</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said at a press conference today that senior Japanese officials are still considering appropriate measures to deal with the terrorist incident in Shanghai and are expected to lodge a formal protest soon. He said that the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Army Minister, and Navy Minister met last night and sent a telegram to the Japanese authorities in Shanghai demanding that the Public Concession Municipal Council immediately arrest the murderers of Chen Lu, the Foreign Minister of the "Reformed Government," and the Chinese terrorists who committed "thirty similar acts of violence." He also demanded that the Municipal Council take steps to prevent future terrorist incidents. If the Municipal Council fails to arrest the culprits and the violence continues, the Municipal Council will be notified that the Japanese government considers the Municipal Council unable to maintain peace and order in the Public Concession. At that time, the Japanese government will take appropriate measures to maintain peace and order in the Public Concession, and if necessary, will exercise "the right to use force for self-defense."</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Meet</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that last night (the 21st), the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Emergency Committee of Japanese Residents in Shanghai, consisting of leaders of the Japanese community in Shanghai, held a special meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the situation in the city, focusing on the threat of political terrorists to Japanese civilians. The Japanese Consul General, Miura, also attended the meeting. At the same time, the idea of convening a mass meeting of Japanese residents to urge the Japanese authorities to take more decisive action and allow them to take decisive action in the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek is growing. A member of the committee said that before this mass meeting can be held, representatives of the Japanese community must consult with the army, navy, and diplomatic authorities to discuss a solution. The Shanghai Japanese Journalists Association also held an emergency general meeting in a building at the corner of Zha Lu Road and Peng Lu Road yesterday to demand the clearing of political terrorism cases in Shanghai, passing a resolution demanding that the Japanese authorities use "drastic measures" to deal with the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Councilor Returns to His Country</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post reported that Morishima, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, was summoned back to his country to report on the situation in Shanghai, especially in connection with the outbreak of terrorist incidents, and left for Tokyo by plane at 9:30 this morning (the 22nd).</p>
<p>Flagship Meeting</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd. According to Japanese sources in Shanghai, Japanese diplomatic, naval, and army authorities held an emergency meeting on the Japanese flagship Izumo in Shanghai and decided that if the Public Concession Municipal Council could not handle the terrorist incidents satisfactorily, they would "take independent action to maintain peace and order in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Saito Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd. According to Japanese sources, Saito, the former police chief of Tokyo, left here today for Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, he will take on important work in maintaining peace and order. Saito has been an advisor to the Japanese Marine Corps in Shanghai since June of last year.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Cares for the Suffering of the Poor, Orders Pawnshops to Reduce Interest Rates, Agricultural Bank Extends Loan Terms to Pawnshops, Pawnshops in War Zones Should Allow Redemption Without Losses</h3>
<p>While the National Government is busy with the military operations of the war of resistance, it is still deeply concerned about the suffering of the people. Pawnshops in various places mostly charge very high interest rates due to capital turnover issues, and the redemption periods are too short, which greatly affects the livelihoods of the poor. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has issued a notice to the provincial and municipal governments, instructing them to rectify the pawnshops, reduce interest rates, and extend the redemption periods to benefit the poor. The Ministry has also ordered the China Farmers Bank to consider the situation in various places and provide low-interest loans to pawnshops to ease their financial difficulties, so that both the difficulties of merchants and the suffering of the poor can be addressed. Also, pawnshops in war zones, even though they have transported the pawned goods to safe areas, still falsely claim that they have suffered losses due to the war, making it impossible for farmers to recover their clothes and ornaments. This kind of behavior is no different from robbing people by taking advantage of the situation. The Ministry has also ordered the local authorities in various places to investigate the matter separately. Those who have not suffered losses should allow as much redemption as possible.</p>

<h3>Unable to Withstand Japanese Puppet Oppression, Ferryboats Go on Strike, All Industries Ask for Assistance to Discuss Joint Resistance</h3>
<p>In the Changyinsha, Hupu, Baimao and other places along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Japanese army and navy are constantly in conflict over the rights of the port, causing the port ferryboats (Yanghua boats) to be ordered to be checked by the Japanese warship when loading goods or passengers to be transported to the outer wheel outside the port. If they are not satisfied, they will shoot and kill people at will. The lives of boatmen are not guaranteed. In order to resist this barbarous act, the ferryboats in each port suddenly went on strike yesterday when the local industries opened. All the big and small ferryboats were driven into the inland river to dock, and the oars, rudders, masts and sails were dismantled. The attitude was quite resolute. There are many local products from the shops in various industries waiting to be shipped to Shanghai, which are piled up everywhere, and the situation is very urgent. However, not only the boatmen are victimized by the various oppressive acts of the Japanese army and navy stationed along the river, but also the innocent merchants and people are killed. The Japanese military authorities have never been heard to have taken severe measures. This proves that the Japanese are condoning the troops and raising evil people. Therefore, they express sympathy for the ferry boat strike, which is a violent act of resistance, and are planning an effective method to carry out the struggle.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Ship Adada, Japan Still Has Not Released, No Information in Xiamen</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Navy told reporters yesterday (the 21st) that the Hungarian ship Adada, which was hijacked by a Japanese Navy patrol ship a few weeks ago and escorted to Xiamen, is still detained in the port. The spokesman did not receive any formal information from the Xiamen authorities, but he believed that the crew of the ship had been released.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Warship Was Hit and Damaged, Landing in Haimen Failed, Japan Blockaded Jiaojiang, Hindering Navigation, There Were Artillery Battles and Japanese Aircraft Reconnaissance in Haimen</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese warships bombarded Haimen in eastern Zhejiang on February 18 in an attempt to land, they were bravely repulsed by the garrison. The Japanese warships blockaded Jiaojiang in Haimen and sent aircraft to reconnaissance various parts of eastern Zhejiang. The fire along the river in Haimen has been extinguished, and a Japanese warship was hit and damaged. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fire Extinguished</p>
<p>After the Japanese warships concentrated in Taizhou and Haimen in eastern Zhejiang, they bombarded Haimen for several days. The shells fell on the wasteland on the north bank, and our side suffered no losses. However, the Haimen Water Police Office was hit by a shell, but fortunately there were no casualties. Japanese aircraft flew over various parts of eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance for several days, but did not drop bombs. The fire along the river in Haimen, which started on the 20th, has been extinguished, destroying hundreds of houses. It is said that the fire was set by traitors to respond to the Japanese army's landing. Fortunately, the Japanese army failed to succeed due to our side's brave selection and attack. The Japanese plan completely failed.</p>
<p>Blockade of Jiaojiang</p>
<p>Jiaojiang in Taizhou (i.e. Taizhou Bay) has been completely blockaded by our garrison, and mines and other objects have been placed to prohibit ships from entering or leaving. The blockade line is very solid. Today, because the Japanese army failed to land, they towed several sailing boats loaded with sand and gravel, which they took from the sea the night before, to the mouth of Jiaojiang and sank them next to the blockade line, and erected bamboo poles as markers. The purpose was to block Jiaojiang so that ships could not enter or leave. Now the bamboo poles and other objects have been blown up by our side.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Hit</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency interviewed crew members of the Meiyuan, a ship that arrived in Shanghai from Yongbo yesterday. According to them, according to news from the Ningbo authorities, on the 18th, two Japanese warships sailed to the Jiaojiang blockade line and fired on Haimen. The local garrison immediately returned fire. One of the Japanese warships was hit by a shell and was seriously damaged. It immediately stopped firing and left Jiaojiang, apparently to be repaired elsewhere. Currently, there are still many Japanese warships outside the mouth of Jiaojiang, and the Jiaojiang blockade line has not been broken by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Ningbo and Wenzhou Under Martial Law</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, although war has broken out in Haimen, eastern Zhejiang, Ningbo and Wenzhou, as ports in eastern Zhejiang, have been placed under special martial law. The Yong River in Ningbo and the Ou River in Wenzhou have been closed to night navigation, and ships entering and leaving are subject to strict inspection. Although a waterway is left open for navigation in the blockade, the entire blockade can be implemented if necessary. Both places have defensive works and are stationed with heavy troops, but the area is as peaceful as ever, and all industries are open for business as usual. Although Japanese aircraft have passed through, they have not dropped bombs. As for Dinghai Island, ships are prohibited from docking. The police and militia on the island maintain order.</p>
<p>Reported in Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Navy told reporters yesterday (the 21st) that the Japanese Navy authorities have blockaded the port of Haimen and built a water barrier in the port on the 19th of this month. The Japanese side has notified all countries that this measure was taken for military needs. The spokesman also replied to questions that military supplies were transported through Haimen to the Chinese army, and also said that the Japanese army did not attempt to land in Haimen.</p>

<h3>To Enhance the Love of Husband and Wife - The Weak and Kidney Deficiency Must Be Eliminated Quickly</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>The impact of kidney deficiency on the love of husband and wife has become an iron law, which cannot be denied. Looking at divorce cases, especially regarding the husband's inability to fulfill his reproductive responsibilities, the wife's side is often justified and has sufficient reasons. This shows the great impact of kidney deficiency on family peace and personal happiness.</p>
<p>Speaking of the causes of kidney deficiency, it is most common in the elderly. This is due to physiological reasons and comes from the reduced excitability of the central nervous system. If it is a young person, apart from excessive sexual activity or masturbation, which leads to kidney deficiency, people who usually smoke and drink excessively will also have their central nervous system anesthetized, reducing its function. Over time, kidney deficiency will definitely occur.</p>
<p>In addition, excessive weakness of the body, or diseases such as diabetes and nephritis, can also reduce erectile function. Also, excessive fatness, spinal cord tuberculosis, etc., can also eliminate its reproductive function. All other diseases can cause physical weakness, and sexual desire will definitely decrease accordingly.</p>
<p>As for kidney deficiency caused by excessive sexual activity and self-injury from masturbation, it is called "sexual neurasthenia." Kidney deficiency caused by neurasthenia also causes the ejaculation center to lose its effectiveness, which is called "paralytic kidney deficiency." With this kind of problem, sexual life after marriage is very painful.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned types of kidney deficiency are indeed a lifelong shackle for patients, but from the results of practical experiments by famous doctors in various countries, it is proven that the above-mentioned diseases can only be cured with endocrine agents. Other therapies can only be used as an aid. Famous doctors such as (ChixsostomM.D.Drhunter) and scientists such as Dr. Ploled, etc., compiled various endocrine agents from around the world for chemical analysis and animal experiments. The results proved that the male "Buti Kang," a preparation of the youthful glands of majestic animals "i.e., the entire testicles" invented by the German physiologist Dr. Meulen, is the most effective. When I was in Russia, I made dozens of chemical tests of the ingredients of "Buti Kang," proving that the animal testicles it contains are mainly chimpanzees, so its effect is far superior to similar preparations. Regular consumption can indeed rejuvenate. The female Buti Kang has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting conception.</p>
<h3>Frequent Nocturnal Emission Should Be Actively Saved</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>Frequent nocturnal emission indicates that the spermatic valve has become loose and unbearable, and at the same time, the youthful glands that dominate sexual desire also lose their prosperity due to the constant flow of semen. Also, committing masturbation and nocturnal emission when development is not yet complete can lead to incomplete development and short and small genitals. As for the weakness of brain nerves, it is closely related to nocturnal emission. Each time masturbation is committed, a large amount of blood is consumed. Over time, the function of its metabolism decreases, and then insomnia, forgetfulness, mental fatigue, headache, palpitations, night sweats, tinnitus, pale complexion, and sore limbs will follow one after another.</p>
<p>If a patient with nocturnal emission falls into the above-mentioned symptoms, not only will it have a great impact on health, but also his lifelong happiness will be unimaginable! Therefore, he should actively treat it in order to save it. According to the most advanced treatment method, he should take "Ners Nocturnal Emission Tablets." The tablets are effective quickly and can permanently cure nocturnal emission. If various symptoms of weakness have already been caused, he should also take the testicular essence preparation "Buti Kang" to replenish losses, which can be completely cured.</p>

<h3>The Latest Strong Military Equipment in Various Countries</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Cannot but give credit to the invention of the specific drug for gonorrhea</p>
<p>The crisis of world war is approaching day by day, and is imminent. The navies, armies and air forces of various countries are locked in an atmosphere of tension. In order to prevent the decline of the energy of the soldiers in wartime and cause failure, before the war, the military authorities of various countries specially dispatched appointed doctors to conduct strict examinations of the soldiers individually. After detailed examination, it was found that about 70-80% of them had venereal diseases, and gonorrhea was the most common among venereal diseases. The treatment of this widespread disease is indeed a difficult one. However, Europe is, after all, the birthplace of science. The treatment of gonorrhea has long exceeded the standard line. All doctors in various countries stipulate that doctors should adopt the latest scientific methods, that is, the "Climino," a mixed preparation of proteome and yellow pigment invented by Dr. Peter, is used as an internal medicine. After trial use, acute gonorrhea can be completely cured in about three or four bottles. Chronic gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, arthritis, etc., can be completely eradicated in a short period of time, and blood tests prove that it has been cured.</p>
<p>According to the experiment of Professor Meitingkov of the University of Paris, he used artificial infection with gonorrhea in apes, and saw that both testicles swelled. Feeding them with other gonorrhea drugs increased the disease. Only by feeding them with "Climino" mixed with food could they be completely cured in about four or five weeks. Therefore, gonorrhea patients competed to buy and take it, and it was very effective. In addition, in order to prevent the spread of gonorrhea in other countries' brothels, prostitutes mostly took large doses of "Climino." They used to have "laundries" set up by the government with many scientific facilities. Those who asked for willows and flowers used medicated water to wash each other beforehand to avoid mutual infection, but since the invention of "Climino," gonorrhea has been drastically reduced, and there is no need to use this troublesome procedure. This is really a major invention in gonorrhea science. It is appropriate for countries to choose healthy conscripts and regular soldiers and meet more standards.</p>

<h3>New Treatment for Prostatitis</h3>
<p>Initial Characteristics</p>
<p>The initial characteristic of prostatitis is a deep pain in the front of the anus, frequent urination, and very little urine. When urination is about to end, there is a stabbing pain in the penis. If a finger is inserted into the anus, there is tenderness due to the enlarged prostate, hence this allergic reaction. In this case, the doctor must administer the latest treatments, such as cooling anal suppositories for the prostate, internal medicine "Climino," and injections, so that prostatitis, which is generally avoided by doctors, can be effective. Prostatitis is not only painful and unbearable, but also has endless harm to the future of reproduction. The reason is that the prostate can secrete a kind of liquid, which is called prostatic fluid, which has the element of nurturing sperm. Just like fish and water. Fish cannot survive without water, and sperm cannot reproduce without prostatitis. Therefore, those suffering from gonorrheal prostatitis must pay attention to these places.</p>
<p>Examples of Verified Cases</p>
<p>The following are examples of cases that I have verified. The patient was a male named Lu; because he went to a brothel, he felt pain when urinating on the fourth day, the foreskin was swollen, and purulent liquid flowed from the urethra. He came to me for treatment, shaking his head and frowning, in great pain. The prostate was swollen, the urethra was blocked, and there was a lot of turbid flow when pressed. It was diagnosed as acute urethritis and complicated with prostatitis. So I first used blood serum injection, and used cold compresses and anal suppositories, and at the same time took "Climino," to make it have an anti-gonorrheal phagocytic effect, and German static electricity therapy, so that the inflammatory secretions can be prevented from clogging the urethra, and promote the elimination of inflammation. After about a day of treatment, the inflammation completely subsided, the pain disappeared, and the treatment continued for three weeks. Examination confirmed that it had been completely cured. But if Mr. Lu had not treated it early, it would have become chronic and irreversible. Diagnosis time: 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. Starting from today, 20 patients will be sent for diagnosis every day, and each patient will only be charged 50 cents.</p>
<h3>Pulmonary Disease Requires Early Awareness</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Most patients with pulmonary disease experience a slight cough once or twice, or a severe cough with phlegm, decreased appetite, and listlessness. They wish to gain weight, but instead lose it daily, and thus consumption develops. If effective treatment can be given at this time, a complete cure can be hoped for, and the results are easily achieved. If it is delayed until the second or third stage of serious illness, it cannot be cured without a long period of time. Therefore, those suffering from pulmonary disease should seek early treatment, but finding an effective internal medicine for treating consumption is difficult. This is what I have constantly felt over the past 20 years of clinical practice. However, since Dr. Stoebe in Germany invented "Pulmonary Nale," the solution became clear. The efficacy of "Pulmonary Nale" lies in its ability to eliminate the oxygen necessary for pulmonary disease, thereby depriving the pathogens of their ability to function. It is remarkably effective for symptoms such as hemoptysis, coughing with phlegm, chest pain, night sweats, and fever caused by consumption.</p>

<h3>Trade Commission Stipulates Methods for Collecting Local Products at Ports for Export: First Concentrate in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Zhejiang, Then Transport to Ports; Fuhua and Others Are Responsible for Purchasing</h3>
<p>After the Trade Commission unified the transportation and sales of major domestic products to Hong Kong for export, it has now decided that domestic products from various provinces should first be concentrated in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Zhejiang, and then transported to Hong Kong for export. Fuhua Company, the Resources Commission, the Vegetable Oil Company, etc., are responsible for purchasing and transporting the goods. As a result, foreign trade is improving. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Concentrating Domestic Product Exports in Hong Kong</p>
<p>After the export of major domestic products from the mainland is concentrated in Hong Kong, they will be loaded onto ships and transported to various overseas locations. Products from Sichuan, Yunnan, Kang, etc., will first be concentrated in Kunming, and then transshipped to Haiphong and then to Hong Kong. Products from Guizhou, Guangxi, Hubei, etc., will first be concentrated in Guiyang, then transshipped to Nanning, and then transported to Guangzhou Bay and then to Hong Kong. Products from Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, etc., will first be concentrated in Ningbo or Wenzhou, and then loaded onto ships and transported to Hong Kong. In addition to establishing a branch in Hong Kong to oversee the concentrated export of domestic products, the Trade Commission will also establish offices in Kunming, Guiyang, Nanchang, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places. It is currently planning to establish an office in Haiphong.</p>
<p>Responsible for Purchasing Domestic Products Separately</p>
<p>Regarding the purchase of major domestic products: Tea will be handled by Fuhua Trading Company; Tungsten ore will be handled by the Resources Commission; Tung oil will be handled by the Vegetable Oil Company. Each commission has established offices in Hong Kong to handle the concentrated transportation and sales matters. However, the Trade Commission, based on foreign market prices and the production costs of these goods, will separately determine the purchase prices for the place of origin and the distribution market of each item. However, to maintain merchants' business, the principle is to encourage and assist Chinese and foreign merchants to purchase. If merchants are unwilling to purchase due to high prices, the commission will purchase as much as possible.</p>
<p>Exports Increase Sharply After Unification</p>
<p>The export of major domestic products has been quite effective after being unified. The export volume has increased sharply since the beginning of the war. All goods that were previously for export but cannot currently be transported and sold independently are purchased by the government at a negotiated price. The purchase price is announced every week or ten days in the purchase area, so that collectors and transporters can follow it, making every effort to maintain the livelihood of general small merchants. It is stipulated that the transportation of domestic products is insured for war risk by the Central Trust Bureau, and the insurance premium is allowed to be recorded in the account. If the goods are sold at a loss, the insurance premium is waived. However, merchants who export goods on their own, such as tung oil and tea, are required to settle and sell foreign exchange according to law, but are allowed to be exempt from export duties.</p>
<h3>Foreigners in Kuling Do Not Wish to Withdraw; Establish Neutral Zone</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that a Japanese military spokesperson told reporters yesterday (the 21st) that foreigners in Kuling will withdraw today (the 22nd). According to news from Jiujiang, they will go down the mountain under the management of British and American naval officers. Some foreigners in Kuling have decided to stay on the mountain. It has been heard that a neutral zone will be established, where foreigners can go when Japanese aircraft carry out bombing of the area.</p>
<h3>Case of Italian Soldiers Shooting and Wounding Workers: Italian Consulate Offers Compensation; Compensation of 200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Worker Chen Peiqing, a native of Yixing, was shot and seriously wounded in the leg by Italian troops for no reason at the Xiaoshadu Road Yaoshui Lane entrance on the morning of the 11th of last month. Afterwards, his family reported to the Yixing Native Place Association in Shanghai, requesting assistance and relief. Upon receiving the report, the association sent personnel to investigate the facts and immediately sent letters to the Italian Consulate and the Public Works Department to negotiate. It is now known that Deputy Chief of the Public Works Department He Deqiu and Chinese Director Jiang Yiping came forward to mediate and negotiate, and the Italian Consulate has agreed to give Chen Peiqing a compensation of 200 yuan to settle the case.</p>
<h3>American Nationals in Shanghai Celebrate Washington's Birthday Yesterday; Dance Held the Night Before</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that American nationals in Shanghai will celebrate Washington's Birthday today (the 22nd). The main event will be that the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, will host some American nationals in Shanghai at the Columbia Country Club. American nationals in this city will all be on holiday today. The U.S. Consulate General and many American commercial organizations will be closed. Although the soldiers of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai will also be on holiday, they have not prepared any special celebrations. The American Club held a Washington's Birthday dance last night (the 21st). Leading figures of the American community in Shanghai, such as Marine Corps Commander Colonel Fagan, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet Admiral Yarnell, and Gauss, all attended.</p>
<h3>Drugs Rampant and Frightening in the Western District of Shanghai; Supplied in Large Quantities by the Japanese Military Special Service Department, the Income from Which is Used to Pay for Military Expenses; Shanghai Has Begun the Path of Degeneration</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that crime and assassinations are rampant in the Western District of Shanghai. Among them, the most poisonous threat is opium. The Chinese in that area are in danger of complete degeneration. With the permission and assistance of the Japanese authorities, opium is transported to the area to be sold openly in opium dens. Although the Public Works Department has protested and foreign residents outside the Western District concession have also complained, the authorities outside the concession have ignored this and are still rapidly implementing the plan. The situation in that area today can only be described as "frightening." The drug trade is far more serious than other, even the most serious threats. Opium and other drugs can be legally sold in all areas under Japanese control, and Shanghai has also begun the path of degeneration. The authorities collect money from the opium dens and earn huge profits. According to investigations, there were attempts to establish opium dens in the Western District as early as January last year, but these plans were not realized until the end of November. Eleven opium dens were established. The reason for the delay in officially opening opium dens was that the Japanese wanted the opium den owners to first pay a "deposit" of 3,000 yuan per quarter. Although the opium den owners were unable to pay, to this day, there are as many as 34 known opium dens in the Western District, all of which are making huge profits. It is expected that there will be more people who follow to establish opium dens in the future, because both the opium den owners and the Japanese can greatly benefit from this trade. Opium den owners must pay 1,000 yuan per month to the local rulers, but because the amount was too large, it was reduced to 500 yuan before they could operate. This opium is transported in large quantities by the Japanese military special service department from Hongkou to supply the opium dens. In mid-December last year, an Opium Den Association was established on Avenue Petain, and the opium den owners joined the association as members. The association then moved to Jessfield Road. The authorities obtained huge income from the members of the association, which was used to pay for military expenses. Therefore, they refused to hand over the opium dens in the area to the control of the "Reformed Government." In addition to opium dens and gambling dens, a heroin smuggling center was established last month at 477 Route Robert, the corner of Pinglang Road, under the false name of Tai Chang (transliteration) Tobacco Exchange Shop. The operators seem to be three Koreans, and several rogues from the Western District are used as drug dealers. In January of this year, the Japanese authorities established the "Opium Smuggling Prevention Group" in the Jessfield Road area, which was presided over by a Japanese advisor of the "Shanghai Municipal Government." The office was located at 21, Lane 61, Chennault Road. The group was divided into two departments: one dealt with smuggling cases involving Japanese and Koreans, and the other dealt with cases involving Chinese. The group's expenses were naturally paid for by the monthly collections from the opium dens. At the end of last year, a "General Bureau for the Prohibition of Opium" was also established, with its office on the sixth floor of the Broadway Mansions, with the aim of implementing an opium monopoly plan in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The detailed actions of this group are not yet known, but its establishment is intended to collect money to pay for military expenses, which seems to be beyond doubt. At the beginning of August last year, it was decided to establish an "Opium Monopoly Bureau" in West Shanghai, so it was planned to rent three houses at Nos. 6, 7, and 70, Lane 538, Connaught Road, as warehouses for storing Da Jing opium. However, as far as is known, this proposed "Bureau" has not yet started operations.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association Stipulates Measures for Purchasing Raw Cotton in Ningbo; Members Apply for Certificates from the Association to Ensure It Is for Their Own Use and Not for Resale</h3>
<p>For the Shanghai Chinese cotton mills to purchase raw materials in Ningbo, after the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, the Cotton Mill Association has now complied with the order and stipulated the following six measures for Shanghai Chinese cotton mills to obtain certificates for purchasing raw cotton in Ningbo: 1. Chinese cotton mills that are members of this association and whose factories are located in the special zone south of the Suzhou River in Shanghai may apply to this association for a certificate for purchasing raw cotton if they go to Ningbo to purchase raw cotton. 2. Those who apply to this association for a certificate must declare that it is for their own factory's use and must not resell it to other factories. 3. Cotton mills that go to Ningbo to purchase cotton must first submit a letter signed by the manager, clearly stating the quantity of raw cotton to be purchased, the purchase period, the entrusted cotton firms, and the number of purchase orders, and send it to this association for review. After approval, a certificate will be issued. 4. After the cotton mill that has been approved to receive the certificate receives notification from this association, it will immediately notify the entrusted cotton firm to bring the signed purchase order to the association to receive the certificate. 5. After obtaining the certificate from this association, they will use the certificate from this association to obtain a certificate from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. 6. After the certified raw cotton is delivered to the factory, the factory should send the original certificate to the association for cancellation.</p>
<h3>British Army West Yorkshire Regiment Sends Out Patrols</h3>
<p>The British army stationed in Shanghai has not sent out patrols on the roads for a long time. Because of the repeated terrorist incidents in Shanghai in recent days, the British Army West Yorkshire Regiment reappeared on Nanjing Road on the evening of the 21st, totaling eight people, along with one of the three Sergeants from the Old Zha Police Station, patrolling together.</p>
<h3>Rice from the Place of Origin Can Still Be Transported to Shanghai; Detained Rice Boats Have Been Released; Rice Industry Set to Open Market on Designated Day</h3>
<p>The Japanese side had prohibited the transportation and export of rice from various producing areas along the port starting from the 17th of this month, which greatly angered inland rice merchants. After arguing based on reason, the Japanese side, finding it difficult to go against public opinion, still allowed free transportation and sales to Shanghai, but purchases from Shantou and other places were absolutely prohibited. The Shanghai rice market will open tomorrow, and commissions will be unified. Details of the situation are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Local Resistance to Prohibition of Rice Export</p>
<p>The Japanese side, using its special violence in the occupied areas, not only detained seven rice boats on February 17th of this year, but also suddenly prohibited the export of rice from various producing areas along the river, and even Shanghai was included in the prohibition. At that time, the Shanghai rice industry groups instructed local merchants to conduct detailed investigations in order to plan how to cope with the situation. At the same time, the inland rice merchants were greatly angered by the illegal actions of the Japanese side and jointly protested and negotiated with the Japanese side. As a result, the Japanese side, finding it difficult to go against public reason and humanity, allowed rice from the producing areas to be freely transported and sold to Shanghai, but the rice transported to Shantou and other places was still prohibited. As for the rice transported to Shanghai, the heavy taxes and fees are still being protested by the rice merchants.</p>
<p>Detained Rice Boats Have Been Released</p>
<p>According to news from the rice industry, after seven rice boats anchored at the mouth of the Hupoo River were detained by the Japanese Navy at the end of the lunar year, rice firms such as Xinfeng in this city repeatedly negotiated and have been released. Regarding the three crew members who were killed and injured by Japanese warships firing guns, the firms raised funds to compensate the families and bear the medical expenses to settle the matter.</p>
<p>Rice Market Opens Tomorrow</p>
<p>The rice market in this city, with the end of the general settlement period and the expiration of the holiday, is scheduled to resume opening at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. The sales and splitting of transactions by brokers will be carried out in accordance with the previously set regulations. The original regulations for rice transactions were a commission of 1.2 cents per stone, but due to competition among the industry, it was inconsistent. Therefore, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association reiterated the previous proposal and uniformly charged a commission of 1.2 cents per stone. If anyone is found to arbitrarily reduce the commission, they will be punished immediately.</p>
<h3>Court Order Interprets Trademark Ambiguities; If the Organization of the Company Name is Particularly Distinct and Complies with Regulations, Registration Shall be Approved</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, based on an order from the Executive Yuan and interpreted by the Judicial Yuan, regarding the ambiguity of applying for registration of one's own company name as a trademark, specifically instructed the Trademark Bureau to investigate and follow. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Correspondence: It is doubtful whether it is appropriate to approve the application to register one's own company name as a trademark. There are two opposing views on this matter. A. Those who argue that it should not be approved say, in short, that the so-called "having" another person's company name in Article 2, Paragraph 8 of the Trademark Law clearly refers to the subsidiary part of the trademark. Article 14 of the same law is also a general usage law for trademarks and is not the body of the trademark. Therefore, it cannot be used as a reason to register a company name as a trademark. Furthermore, simply using a company name as a trademark does not have a particularly distinct structure, which also violates the provision in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law that it "should be particularly distinct." Moreover, according to Article 14 of the same law, registering a company name does not restrict the effect of the exclusive right to use the trademark. In other words, it cannot be used to resist a third party. Therefore, even if registration is approved, it will not obtain exclusive rights and will be meaningless. B. Those who argue that it should be approved say, in short, that Article 2, Paragraph 8 of the Trademark Law stipulates that with the consent of another person, another person's company name can be used as a trademark. Therefore, it is certainly not a problem to use one's own company name as a trademark. Furthermore, using one's own created company name that is not commonly used by the general public as a trademark does not violate the provision in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law that it "should be particularly distinct." As for Article 14 of the Trademark Law, although there is a provision that "those who express their own name or company name in the manner of ordinary use shall not be restricted by the effect of the exclusive right to use the trademark," this does not prohibit the use of a company name as a trademark, but only restricts the effect of the exclusive right to use the trademark, so that it cannot restrict a third party acting in good faith. The above two views each have their own reasons. The matter concerns the ambiguity in the application of the Trademark Law. It is appropriate to consult your court for investigation and interpretation. As for the grade of public friendship, this consultation is with the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>Order from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, according to Instruction No. 9855 Yu Zi from the Executive Yuan on November 28, 27th year of the Republic of China, "Upon investigation, this Yuan previously consulted the Judicial Yuan regarding the ambiguity in the application of the Trademark Law. Now, with the approval of the Judicial Yuan's Yuan Zi No. 1794 correspondence on October 18, 27th year of the Republic of China, 'It has been resolved by the Uniform Interpretation of Laws Conference of this Yuan that if one's own company name is used as a trademark and application for registration is submitted, if the organization of the company name is particularly distinct, it shall be approved for registration as it is consistent with the provisions of Article 1 of the Trademark Law. A corresponding consultation for reply and investigation,' etc., according to this, inform and follow this order."</p>
<h3>Central Government Sends Personnel to Rectify Salvation Work in Guerrilla Areas; Headquarters Established in Qingpu</h3>
<p>In order to organize educated youth in guerrilla areas to strengthen the strength of the Second Anti-Japanese War, the Central Headquarters of the Three Principles of the People Youth League has specially dispatched investigators to various places to organize reconstruction and salvation command headquarters nearby, so as to be responsible for promoting the salvation work of various groups and training members. The suburbs of Shanghai are currently under the responsibility of Mr. Xue, an investigator stationed in Shanghai. Xue established the command headquarters in the countryside of Tianmashan, Qingpu on the 10th and is actively proceeding. It is heard that the working principle of the headquarters is to unite revolutionary youth, vigorously practice the Three Principles of the People, defend the country, and restore the nation, and to train members to take on the task of resisting Japan and building the country. There are six training guidelines: 1. Strict discipline; 2. Unified will; 3. United spirit; 4. Concentrated strength; 5. Thorough implementation of orders; 6. Realization of the principles and adaptation to the needs of resisting Japan and building the country. Military training is also strictly implemented, so the steps of salvation work in the counties around Shanghai have gradually become consistent and should be able to inflict a serious blow on the enemy.</p>
<h3>Shooting of Japanese People on Nanjing Road Has No Political Connection; Shooter Was Korean, Motive Was Jealousy; Injured Japanese Dancer's Arm Will Be Disabled</h3>
<p>The case of the shooting of three Japanese people on Nanjing Road on the day of the lunar New Year's Day (the 19th) has been proven to have no political connection. The shooter was Korean, and the motive seems to have been jealousy and murder. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 21st), a reporter from a Western newspaper asked a senior official of the Public Concession Police Department about the motive of the case. The official replied that the case indeed had no political connection. According to other sources, the shooter seemed to be Korean. Even the chauffeur of the car hired by the Japanese at the time stated in his confession to the police that he thought the shooter was Japanese or Korean. According to reliable information, the injured person was a dancer who spoke fluent English. Judging from various circumstances, the case must have been out of jealousy by someone who previously loved the dancer. Also, the Japanese military spokesperson mentioned the case of an Oriental person shooting two Japanese army photographers and a Japanese woman on Nanjing Road on Sunday afternoon, saying that the bullet that hit one person's arm was surgically removed by a doctor yesterday after an hour and a half. The bullet was obviously not an ordinary nickel-tipped one, but a specially constructed one that would explode upon contact with the human body. At that time, three large pieces and some fragments were found, but the injured person's arm may be disabled. The injured Japanese woman is not in danger.</p>
<h3>Postal Service Obstructed in War Zones; Situation in Hainan Island Unclear; Wuhan Postal Transport Restricted</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Hainan Island, mail between Shanghai and the island has been clearly obstructed, because no mailbags have arrived in Shanghai recently. Hainan Island has a very large area, with post offices in Haikou, Qiongzhou, and other places. The situation of these post offices since the outbreak of war is very unclear.</p>
<p>Postal Delivery to Haiphong Obstructed</p>
<p>As for southwestern Guangxi Province, which is adjacent to French Annam, mail to that area used to be forwarded through Haiphong. This has also been affected by the war in Hainan Island, and postal delivery has been obstructed. Therefore, no mailbags from that area have arrived in Shanghai recently. As for mail to central Guangxi, after the railway from Jinhua to Guilin was opened, postal deliveries between Shanghai and Guilin have all been routed through Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Haimen Unaffected</p>
<p>As for postal deliveries to Haimen in eastern Zhejiang, although there are no direct sailing vessels between Shanghai and Taizhou after Haimen was bombarded by Japanese warships, everything can be forwarded through Ningbo, so there is no impact. However, parcels that are large in size can all be delivered to eastern Zhejiang, while parcels above Nanchang in Jiangxi Province have been suspended.</p>
<p>Resumption of Postal Service in the Three Towns of Wuhan</p>
<p>Since Hankou fell, postal deliveries between Shanghai and Hankou have been resumed due to the fact that Shi Misi, the director of postal affairs in Hubei District, remained in Hankou. The post offices that have now resumed postal services include Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang. Therefore, mail between Shanghai and these three places has been opened, but transportation is inevitably controlled by one party due to environmental conditions. Therefore, the ships used to transport mail from Shanghai to Hankou or from Hankou to Shanghai are all Japanese merchant ships. Recently, this morning (the 22nd), a batch of mail was sealed and sent from Shanghai, loaded onto the Japanese ship Daixin Maru, and transported to Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang. However, the amount of mail is also very limited.</p>
<h3>French Commercial Counselor Salon to Go to Chongqing First</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that Salon, the commercial counselor of the French Embassy, ​​took his wife to Chongqing via Vietnam yesterday (the 21st) and is expected to return to Shanghai in six weeks. Furthermore, Nicot, a member of the French Embassy, ​​set off for Chongqing last Saturday to take up a new position.</p>
<h3>Opium Dealer Detained</h3>
<p>Yesterday the man from Guangdong, Zheng Jinsheng, was passing the intersection of Avenue Paul Beau and Avenue Foch in the French Concession, when French Police Officer No. 293 saw that his behavior was suspicious. They seized two bags of red earth from his body at the police station. The man said that he lived at No. 8, Lane 452, Xindagu Road, and that the earth was being sent to the home of Zheng Xushi at No. 329, Baokangli. The police chief immediately dispatched Detective Gao Chaozhen to arrest Zheng Xushi. Following that, the police officers from the Public Concession also dispatched detectives to No. 8, Lane 452, Xindagu Road and arrested two men from Guangdong: Zheng Yuntai and Liu Jichao. A box with a mechanism was also seized, containing several taels of opium, as well as scissors and scales. Yesterday, they were all sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting an extension of the investigation period. After questioning by Judge Liao Yuan, it was decided to reschedule the hearing to the 27th. The defendants were taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Extension of Deadline for Imported Goods in Customs Warehouse; Extended to the End of June This Year to Adapt to the Current Business Situation</h3>
<p>For the purpose of further extending the deadline for imported goods in customs warehouses, the Jianghai Customs has issued Notice No. 96, "It has been investigated that the ordinary customs warehouse regulations stipulate the time limit for storing imported goods in customs warehouses. Previously, due to the unstable situation, it was approved to extend it to March 31, 28th year of the Republic of China, as stated in Notice No. 92 of this department on September 30th of last year. Now, in order to adapt to the current business situation, all imported goods stored in customs warehouses, in accordance with Article 14 of the said regulations, originally with a limit of twelve months, are now approved to be extended to June 30th of this year. All goods currently stored in customs warehouses that are due to expire before June 30th of this year are still allowed to be stored until that date. Merchants are requested to be universally informed. This notice is hereby given, Deputy Tax Commissioner of the General Affairs Department, Qiu Zhuoqi."</p>
<h3>Change of Director of the Water Conservancy Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; Song Tong Goes to Chongqing to Take Office</h3>
<p>The national government's national water conservancy affairs have always been planned and handled by the Water Conservancy Office specially established by the Economic Commission, and two water conservancy associations, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, were established to preside over river water conservancy projects. Later, in order to adjust the political structure, a Water Conservancy Department was specially established under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with Zheng Zhaojing as the director. Recently, Mr. Han Guojun, a gentry from northern Jiangsu, and others telegraphed Mr. Zheng to discuss all matters related to water conservancy in northern Jiangsu. It is now known that Mr. Zheng has recently been appointed to another important position and has already submitted his resignation as the director. It has been learned that Song Tong has been selected and appointed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to succeed Zheng as the director of the Water Conservancy Department. Mr. Song has already gone to Chongqing a few days ago to take office.</p>

<h3>Policemen Attacked in Wujiaochang, Detective Killed by Bullet, Also Killing a Pseudo-Policeman and Wounding a Woman; Police Attach Great Importance to This Case</h3>
<p>The Chengdu Road Police Station of the Public Concession received a report the night before last stating that a large number of bandits were hiding in a thatched house with no number at the end of Jessfield Road. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched Western Detective Davis, along with Chinese Detectives Liu Changhong, Zhang Peilan, Wu Junqing, Wang Dianchen, Tian Changchun, and Li Jian, to make arrests. They arrested two men and one woman on the spot and took them back to the police station for interrogation. According to their confession, there were accomplices hiding in another thatched house in the same area. So the detectives went there again but found nothing. After further interrogation, the father confessed that many pawn tickets were hidden in the Yinghua Alley on Robison Road. Thereupon, the original group of detectives, again escorting the original criminals, took a black police car to Yinghua Alley for a third search. When the car arrived there, around 9:40 AM yesterday morning, as they were checking pedestrians in front of the Olympic Theatre (now renamed Fuxing Shaohe Theatre) in Wujiaochang, someone suddenly attacked the police car from the roadside, firing a total of forty to fifty shots. At that time, the Chinese and Western detectives in the car also jumped out of the car, scattered around, and returned fire. Unexpectedly, Chinese Detective Liu Changhong was shot in the face, the bullet entering through the nose and exiting through the back of the head, and he fell to the ground and died on the spot. At the same time, a pseudo-"policeman" numbered 1341, standing by the side of Wujiaochang, was also hit by a stray bullet and died on the spot. Amidst the chaos, the Public Concession Police Department continued to dispatch a large number of detectives and police officers. On the Japanese-puppet side, Japanese military police also went to guard, but the shooters had long since disappeared without a trace. Therefore, there were no results. In addition, a vegetable-buying woman named Tao Baishi, 35 years old, was also grazed on the head by a stray bullet and has been sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Liu's body has been sent to the coroner's office. The body of the pseudo-policeman was taken away by the Japanese-puppet side after the incident. Currently, the police are attaching great importance to this case and are investigating.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Detective Executed in a Tea House on Singapore Road; Stray Bullet Kills a Four-Year-Old Child; After the Incident, Search Finds the Brave Man Already Escaped</h3>
<p>At around 9:30 AM yesterday morning, the "Chinese Youth Anti-Japanese and Punish Traitors Iron Blood Army" was active in the Caojiadu area. At that time, more than a dozen youths, fully armed, gathered next to the Gongda Yarn Factory at No. 60 Singapore Road, and then marched east towards the Malongshun Tea House. Upon reaching the place, one or two youths stepped inside. At that time, Li Hongtao, who used to be a gangster in Zhabei and is now reportedly serving as a</p>
<p>Pseudo-Detective Team</p>
<p>member, was sipping tea. As soon as the youths saw him, they immediately opened fire. The first shot hit Li's head, and he fell to the ground. At the same time, a four-year-old child next to Li was unfortunately killed by a stray bullet. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the youths immediately withdrew. Unexpectedly, a Japanese patrol officer from the police station happened to be passing by and, seeing what had happened, immediately drew his gun and shot at the group of youths, firing a total of</p>
<p>Six Shots</p>
<p>but none of them hit. As a result, all the youths still calmly disappeared into the lane next to the Gongda Yarn Factory. The Italian defense soldiers stationed in the Gongda Yarn Factory, hearing the gunshots, also joined the British defense forces at this time, patrolling and guarding, and immediately cut off traffic around the area, engaging in a search. The Japanese-puppet side also sent Japanese-puppet "police", but the shooters had long since</p>
<p>Disappeared Like a Yellow Crane</p>
<p>and nothing was found. Li's body was taken away by pseudo-officials from the Japanese-puppet side after the incident. However, it was later learned that these youths, when walking out of the lane, had encountered a police patrol car and a mutual shooting occurred, but as a result, they still managed to escape towards Wujiaochang amidst the chaos and none of them were captured.</p>
<h3>Gambling Loss, False Report of Theft, Detective Arrives and Shoots One Person</h3>
<p>At 8:45 PM last night, the Public Concession Police suddenly received a report stating that a theft had occurred at No. 26 Beigaoshou Lane, Haining Road. Upon receiving the report, the police chief immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to make arrests. Upon arriving at the scene and knocking on the door to enter, they saw several people gambling. Seeing a large number of detectives arrive, the gamblers scrambled to flee. At that time, a Western police officer mistakenly thought they were bandits and opened fire with his gun, firing two shots. The bullets hit Yongren Zhao Xiaomao (32 years old) in the chest. The bullets did not penetrate, and he immediately fell to the ground injured, bleeding profusely. Later, Chinese police car number 298 sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. His injuries are very serious and his life is in danger. It is said that one person was also gambling there and, having lost dozens of yuan in legal tender, became extremely angry and went outside and called the police station to falsely report that there were bandits robbing the place.</p>
<h3>Failed Elimination of Traitors, Stray Bullet Injures Person</h3>
<p>At 10:30 PM the night before last (the 21st), at the intersection of Lujia Road, Fahua East Town, Hongkou, seven or eight members of the Youth Anti-Traitor Corps suddenly opened fire on a traitor named Jia with handguns and Mauser pistols, firing more than thirty shots, all of which missed. It was a dark night, and he managed to escape. At that time, audience members at the Hai'ge Road intersection of Fahua East Town and the Weiyang Theater, hearing the alarm, all scrambled to escape, causing stray bullets to hit Li Qiaoyun, a 17-year-old girl from Yangzhou who lived at No. 177 Fahua East Town, in the Central Barber Shop. The bullet entered from her right rib and exited her back. She is now being treated at the Red Cross. Also, Wang Sixing, a peddler from Zhenjiang, was shot in the right foot, and Liu Kouzi, from Jiangbei, was wounded in the arm. These two are not seriously injured.

<h3>Xujiahui Pseudo-"Police" Attacked</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, more than a dozen armed men suddenly came to the Xujiahui Pseudo Police Station. One of them fired a shot first.

At that time, the gamblers, seeing the situation, all fled. However, the men were firing into the air, so no one was injured.</p>
<h3>Department Store Owner Issues Bad Checks to Stave Off Debt, Sentenced to Fine</h3>
<p>The Yong'an Department Store at No. 4029 Robison Road, Hongkou, wholesale purchased the Western socks it sold from the Zhongyuan Socks Factory on Avenue Paul Beau in the French Concession. By the end of the lunar year of Wuyin, it owed Zhongyuan 1,290 yuan in payment for goods. Jiang Yuxuan, from Jiangyin, who was in charge of the store, had no funds to repay. To stave things off, he issued</p>
<p>Three Promissory Notes</p>
<p>one for 290 yuan, to be exchanged at the Guohua Bank, and the other two for 500 yuan each, to be exchanged at the Shanghai Bank. When Zhou Liuyi, the manager of Zhongyuan, presented the notes for exchange at maturity, he learned that the store had no funds. When he went to Yong'an to negotiate with Jiang, the number of creditors who had gathered unexpectedly reached more than thirty. Jiang Yuxuan, however,</p>
<p>Refused to pay a penny and took the opportunity to flee into No. 9 in the nearby vegetable market lane. Zhou reported this to the Pudu Road Police Station in charge, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Jiang. The next morning (the 18th), he was escorted to the First Special District Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Meng Tingke. After the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case, Zhou Liuyi also turned himself in to clarify the matter. The defendant was charged with</p>
<h3>The Ugly Crowd Leaping and Struggling in Both Ningbo and Shanghai, Competing for the Position of Pseudo-Court President, Unable to Reach Agreement Due to Uneven Distribution of Spoils</h3>
<p>After the assassination of Tu Fu (i.e., the defector lawyer Tu Zhenhu), the pseudo-"President of the Nanshi Local Court," the future problem of the pseudo-"court," whether it should continue to exist or be merged with the pseudo-"Judicial Office" in Pudong, and the question of the successor to the pseudo-"President," have all become the focus of contention between the pseudo-organizations of Ningbo and Shanghai over the pseudo-"legal rights" in Shanghai. According to the opinion of the pseudo-"Mayor" Fu Xiao'an, on the pretext of obstruction by the Japanese Navy, the dilapidated pseudo-"court" should be moved from Nanshi to Pudong, and the pseudo-"Judicial Office" in Pudong should be reorganized into a pseudo-"Local Court" to facilitate handling matters. However, Hu Rengtai, the pseudo-"Minister of Justice and Administration of the Maintenance Government," insisted that the pseudo-"court" should still be located in Nanshi, emulating its pre-war status. If the pseudo-"Judicial Office" in Pudong, due to naval relations, is unwilling to be merged into Nanshi, then it should be changed to a pseudo-"Court Branch." On this point of contention, both sides find it difficult to resolve due to the stakes involved. And there are many competitors for the post of pseudo-"President." In Shanghai, there are already three people coveting the position. The pseudo-"Mayor" Fu Xiao'an intends to recommend Fei Guoxi, the pseudo-"Chief of the Criminal Section of the Judicial Office" (also a defector lawyer), while the pseudo-"Secretary-General" Su Xiwentrusted Nanben, the chief of the Japanese Special Service Agency, to recommend Wu Wenzhong, the pseudo-"Director of the Judicial Office" in Pudong. Lu Ying, the pseudo-"Chief of the Police Bureau," has also joined the competition, recommending Peng Bin, the pseudo-"Chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Judicial Office" (i.e., Peng Bingyan). These three have already found it difficult to elect a candidate, and Hu Rengtai, the pseudo-"Minister of Justice and Administration," is still trying to recommend a private individual. Whose hands will the deer fall into remains to be decided. The pseudo-"court" has effectively come to a standstill. The fact that the Ningbo and Shanghai sides are still unable to reach an agreement over this one small puppet vacancy shows a glimpse of the uneven distribution of spoils and intense secret infighting within the pseudo-organization.</p>
<h3>Fortune Teller Disappears Without a Trace, Wife and Daughter Seduced and Raped, Defendant Acquitted in Court</h3>
<p>Xu Li, a 30-year-old woman from Haimen, Jiangsu, residing at No. 18 Jindeli, Avenue du Père Froc, French Concession, retained lawyer Liu Xiang to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Zhao Guofan (residing at No. 83 Dakangli, Avenue Conty) of fraud, seduction, rape, concealing her husband, and plotting to rape her young daughter, requesting investigation of the crimes of fraud and harming the family and morality, etc. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff</p>
<p>married Xu Hanshan in her early years and gave birth to a girl named Guoying, now 14 years old. After the August 13th incident, they fled from their hometown to Shanghai, temporarily residing at No. 10 Taianfang, Avenue du Père Froc. The husband set up a fortune-telling stall outside, and the plaintiff did laundry to make a living. On April 20th last year, she encountered the defendant on the vegetable market road. After talking to each other, the defendant said to the plaintiff, "Your husband's life is hard. Why don't you go to Haimen with me to</p>
<p>Seek a more profitable livelihood?" After deliberation, on the 26th of the same month, the defendant accompanied the plaintiff's husband, Xu Hanshan, to go together. Later, the defendant came again, falsely claiming that her husband had entrusted him to take the plaintiff to live in Haimen and instructed her to buy goods, handing over 250 yuan for the purchase. The plaintiff then took her daughter on the Deyao Wheel to Haimen. The defendant had already rented a house in Shijiazhen, Songjigang, in advance. When asked about her husband's whereabouts, the defendant claimed that he had</p>
<p>Recommended him to be a clerk in the guerrilla team and that he had already left for another place. The plaintiff believed him to be true. Who knew that the defendant had ulterior motives? After the 250 yuan had entered his hands, she was also raped. Later, she came to Shanghai and lived at No. 83 Dakangli. Unexpectedly, on the midnight of September 28th, the defendant took advantage of the plaintiff's sleep to try to rape the young daughter, Guoying. The daughter cried out in alarm and woke up</p>
<p>Enduring this act of violence until now. Her husband is nowhere to be found. She doesn't know where he is being hidden. She requests a strict investigation and that he be punished accordingly, etc. After the court received the lawsuit, Judge Jiang Liquan opened a court session for trial. The defendant retained lawyers Fan Gang and Qian Xingzhong for defense. The court hearing was adjourned for investigation and interrogation. On the day before yesterday, the court was convened again for continued trial. The defendant denied all the facts of the lawsuit. Witnesses were again summoned and questioned in court. Since the case was clear, the court ordered the opening of arguments and then announced the conclusion. The court immediately pronounced its verdict, acquitting the defendant.</p>
<p>The situation of issuing a bad check to stave off the debt and deliberately deceiving was examined from Jiang Yuxuan, who admitted that he owed the money and said that he gave the promissory notes because of a temporary financial turnover problem, etc. The court ruled that Jiang had issued checks without sufficient funds, and it had been clarified after interrogation, so he was sentenced to a fine of 80 yuan. If he was unable to pay, he was allowed to commute the fine to one day of labor service for every two yuan. He should immediately repay the plaintiff 1,290 yuan in legal tender. After providing a shop guarantee that he would be available for summons, he was released from custody.</p>
<h3>Knocking Over the Rice Pot, Wife and Concubine Quarrel, Concubine Commits Suicide by Inhaling Smoke</h3>
<p>Cao Tingyu, from Ningbo, over forty years old, is a tenant at No. 255 Jinchunli, Avenue Foch, Hongkou. He is a driver at the Shanghai Electric Power Company. His wife, named Lao Er, is a female inspector at the Xinzha Police Station. They have two sons. Two years ago, Cao took Zhao Fengbao (21 years old), a woman from Changzhou, as a concubine, who also had a daughter, still in swaddling clothes. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Cao was cooking porridge with boiling water when a boy accidentally knocked over the rice pot, scalding his young daughter, who cried loudly. The wife and concubine both favored their children, and a disagreement arose. Cao, hearing the noise at that time, actually helped his beloved concubine and rebuked Lao Er. Unexpectedly, Lao Er was unwilling to show weakness and retorted, almost resorting to violence. Fortunately, the neighbors mediated and the matter was settled. However, Zhao was unusually depressed afterwards and secretly inhaled two yuan of smoke behind people's backs yesterday afternoon. Before long, the poison took effect. After the family discovered it, they hurriedly hired a car and rushed her to Tongren Hospital for treatment. She was still not out of danger until midnight.</p>
<h3>New Warehouse of Ewo Han Company Found with Armaments; Warehouse Previously Occupied by Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The new wharf of the American Ewo Han Company in Yangjiadu, Pudong, has not been taken over because the Japanese side refuses to return it. One squadron of the Noduchi Unit of the Third Battalion of the Japanese Naval Landing Force stationed in the warehouse has withdrawn, and the warehouse was directly handed over to the Japanese Nissin Company for management. Workers have been sent to clean it inside for days. Unexpectedly, eighteen Type 38 (i.e., Japanese-style) rifles and dozens of hand grenades were suddenly found near the pier the night before last, causing great shock. They reported it to the local pseudo-"Police Bureau," which informed the Japanese Navy and took away the batch of armaments. Japanese officials are now attaching great importance to this case because it would be difficult for others to enter and hide these armaments. It is feared that they were abandoned privately by war-weary elements in the Japanese army during the withdrawal, which is also unknown. Therefore, Battalion Commander Noduchi Sozuke has thoroughly inspected the logistics section of the team to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Refugee Falls and Injured</h3>
<p>Zhang Zitao, 25 years old, a refugee from Hubei at No. 330 First Relief Shelter, Fujian Road, worked in the banking industry in his hometown. Subsequently, because of the fall of Hankou, Zhang lost his job and came to Shanghai to seek refuge, having no relatives and no means of making a living. He had to move into the shelter. However, the shelter is heavily guarded, and ordinary refugees are forbidden to go out unless something happens. Unexpectedly, Zhang, on the occasion of this old lunar new year, intended to walk on the road outside to relieve his pent-up feelings. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, he caught sight of the guard, Jiang Ruifu, taking off his uniform and hanging it in the room before going out to wash his hands. Zhang took advantage of this opportunity and flew into the room, put on the uniform, tied himself to the window with a rope, and slowly lowered himself. Unexpectedly, the rope broke, and Zhang lost his footing and fell down, breaking his right leg bone, which was a severe injury. The officer discovered it and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Occupying Houses, Wanted Tenants</h3>
<p>The houses in Daxingfang, Datong Road, are the property of Xingji Company. Min Shouheng, the tenant of No. 5 Lane, privately sublet the houses to Zhang Gongting and He Chensheng and owed rent for many months. The owner sued the Civil Court of the First Special Court. At the court hearing, Zhang Gongting and He Chensheng appeared and admitted the facts. A judgment was made ordering them to vacate the premises. Zhang and others were dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed, but the appeal was also rejected. Unexpectedly, Zhang and others were unwilling to accept the judgment and colluded with Zhou Henian, the former assistant of Huizhong Tobacco Company, to forge a fake contract in the name of a British company and forcibly occupy the houses. The owner, Xingji Company, retained lawyer Wang Hengyi to criminally sue Zhou Henian in the First Special District Court. The court has been convened many times, but the case has not been concluded because Zhang Gongting failed to appear in court. The Special Court has now issued an arrest warrant for Zhang Gongting, ordering the Old Gate Police Station to arrest him, and the owner, Xingji Company, has published an arrest warrant in the newspaper. It is said that Zhou Henian has moved the Huizhong Tobacco Company out and summoned unknown people to continue the forcible occupation.</p>
<h3>Fresh Eggs Stockpiled in Ningbo and Wenzhou Allowed to Ship to Shanghai; Proof Measures Applied Afterwards</h3>
<p>Many of the fresh eggs in this city are purchased from counties under the jurisdiction of Ningbo and Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang. Since the Customs Bureau ordered the prohibition of transporting goods to Shanghai, eggs are also on the list of prohibitions, resulting in a large number of eggs being stockpiled in Ningbo and Wenzhou. However, eggs are fresh goods and easily rot. After the egg merchants in this city appealed for a lifting of the ban, the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the application of the Chamber of Commerce certification method, and the Customs Bureau released the eggs after inspection. It is said that the eggs stockpiled in Wenzhou have already been released by the Ouhai Customs Bureau and shipped to Shanghai. Those stockpiled in Ningbo have also been certified separately by the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and are being transported to Shanghai one after another.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Current Yarn Market; Market Opens Today; Grey Market Already Open, Prices Up Five, Six, Seven Yuan</h3>
<p>The spot market for cotton yarn will open as usual today after the Spring Festival holiday. According to sources, the grey market for current yarn has already opened. The transaction price for 20-count Double Horse Guangdong yarn is 409 yuan, an increase of 5.5 yuan compared to the final market price last year. Another saying is that the price of other 20-count yarns has also increased by six or seven yuan. This is the grey market situation. The reason is that during these few days of holiday, there has been no change in the war, and our army's position has become more consolidated, people are optimistic, and the market is unanimously bullish. The future is that we must continue to move forward, relying on the extent of actual sales development for arbitration.</p>
<h3>Obstructed Yao Flowers Allowed to Pass</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Yao flowers, which were obstructed in eastern Zhejiang, have reached more than 160,000 packages. The authorities initially disallowed export due to the factory's urgent need. However, after strenuous efforts by certain flower merchants and requests from the local Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations to the authorities for inspection and approval, permission for release has now been granted. It is estimated that about 60,000 to 70,000 packages can be shipped to Shanghai, with the first batch of over 10,000 packages expected to arrive tomorrow for customs declaration and import.</p>
<h3>Finance: Silver Prices Weak in London and India</h3>
<p>A telegram from London on the 21st reported that American merchants made slight sales while also engaging in some profit-taking, resulting in a stable market. The closing price remained unchanged. There were some sellers at the listed price. Spot silver fell by 0.0625, and forward silver fell by 0.4375. A telegram from New York indicated that silver prices in America remained stagnant. Furthermore, a telegram from Bombay revealed that the Indian silver market was slightly weak, with spot prices down by 6 annas, near-term prices down by 2 annas, and forward prices down by 1 anna.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Optimistic Outlook for the New Year Market</h3>
<p>Before the complete settlement of national sugar, over 10,000 packages arrived. Due to high acquisition costs, there is a relatively tight supply. It is predicted that the opening price today will rise. Shantou refined white sugar is expected to be around $24.50, top white sugar $23.50, special white sugar $20 to $19.50, Zhiyang $17, Tizhuang green $15.50, Huanggang green $15, Longjiang green $13.50, top Diao green $14.50, top red $15.50, middle red $15, ordinary $14.50, special high $16, and Hainan red $13.50 to $13. Foreign sugar is also expected to increase slightly, with Taikoo granulated white B mark calling for an increase of 5 jiao. Coarse white and Dutch red also have the potential to rise. However, according to industry insiders, this spring season sales may not be exceptionally strong, and the situation in eastern Zhejiang is tight, which may hinder sales. Therefore, raising sugar prices too high is not advisable. Furthermore, Japanese sugar products are being produced in Shanghai, which will inevitably have a considerable impact in the future.</p>
<h3>Last Season's Sugar Industry: Profitability Still Good</h3>
<p>Last season's sugar industry, due to the extraordinary times and excessive market price fluctuations, experienced unstable ups and downs, making business more difficult. However, special circumstances sometimes led to profits. Therefore, the overall result was still good. Larger businesses still had profits of over $100,000 to $50,000 or $60,000, while smaller ones ranged from over $10,000 to several thousand. Very few incurred losses. Three new organizations were established this season: Dachang, Hengyuan, and Yintai. The profits of the previous season are listed below in thousands of dollars:</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Large Shipment of Italian Artificial Silk Arrives</h3>
<p>Dutch Sugar and Beeswax Also Imported</p>
<p>During this Lunar New Year, when most businesses are still on holiday, both northern and southern imports and exports are limited. In Jiangbei, downstream of the Yangtze River, only pork and fresh eggs have been transported. Other goods are completely absent. It is reported that a large shipment of local paper will arrive from Ningbo today. As for the Yong Sheng vessel, which is carrying a large shipment of cotton, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, it is now expected to enter the port today. Furthermore, yesterday, the Italian vessel "Con Te Pio Ardo" (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai, carrying a large shipment of 4,800 boxes of artificial silk from Italy, marking the largest import of artificial silk since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Additionally, on Lunar New Year's Eve (the 18th), the Dutch vessel imported 12,500 packages of granulated sugar, 12,300 packages of beeswax, and 2,260 packages of tapioca starch. It also brought 240 boxes of coffee and 48 items of pepper from Southeast Asia, along with 820 boxes of bark. Finally, it transferred 6,570 pieces of nickel, 418 boxes of glass, and 180 tons of paper from Europe via Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Paper: Tin Foil Decides to Increase Prices at the Start of the Year</h3>
<p>The consumption of tin foil last year was unprecedented in Shanghai. This is due not only to the sharp increase in the city's population but also to its role as a distribution center for purchases from other areas. Winter sales were even stronger, and although the supply from production areas was continuous, it was still insufficient. The production areas in Hangzhou and Shaoxing are close to the war zones, and houses have been bombed, causing workers to disperse. Therefore, labor costs are high, and large-scale production remains difficult. As a result, the industry decided at the end of the Lunar Year that the price of a whole pack would increase by 2 jiao per pack, and the retail price would increase by 2 fen per sheet at the start of the year. If production costs fluctuate, a further price adjustment will be discussed around the 25th or 26th, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Felt Hat Industry</h3>
<p>The felt hat industry has only been around for just over ten years in China. Although felt hats became a necessity in society more than ten years ago, there were virtually no Chinese entrepreneurs engaged in the felt hat industry at that time. Therefore, all the felt hats popular in the market were imported goods. Companies like Yixing Baoke and Lulin Meizuishi, owned by Italian merchants, imported a considerable number of felt hats each year.</p>
<p>It was not until the teens of the Republic that Chinese entrepreneurs began to establish hat factories. The first was the Hua Fu Hat Factory. When the factory was established, due to the complexity of hat manufacturing and a lack of experience, it could only manufacture and sell felt hats from hat bodies (note). Later, due to the good quality of the products, the patriotism of the Chinese people, and the lower prices, they were widely purchased. As a result, foreign goods gradually began to lose ground in the Chinese market. The factory then further studied the manufacturing of hat bodies, and in a few years, it succeeded in manufacturing hat bodies from wool, and then making felt hats from the hat bodies, without relying on foreigners.</p>
<p>After several years of hard work by the factory, the number of hat factories established by Chinese entrepreneurs gradually increased. In Shanghai alone, there were more than twenty before the war, such as Hua Fu, Zhonghua, Hua Yu, Hua Sheng, Xu Weiji, Zhongyang, and Lihua. Unfortunately, apart from Hua Fu, Hua Sheng, and Lihua, the other factories could only use hat bodies to make felt hats. Although Hua Fu and the other two factories could make hat bodies, they were insufficient to meet the demand from their competitors. Therefore, hat bodies still had to be imported. In recent years, the quantity of domestic products has been increasing day by day, and the quality can also compete with imported products. As a result, foreign felt hats have almost disappeared from the Chinese market. Unexpectedly, the artillery fire of August 13th destroyed many of the hat factories in Shanghai. Most of the factories were located in Hongkou and the Nanshi district. As a result, when the war started, the factory sites became war zones. Only three or so factories, such as Zhonghua and Huaxing, were located in the concession areas. When the demand for felt hats surged last September and October, due to the large-scale purchases by various merchant groups, the inventory was almost exhausted. On the one hand, there was a shortage of products, and supply could not meet demand. At that time, the manufacturers realized that if there were no large quantities of felt hats produced, the entire felt hat industry would be on the verge of collapse. Some manufacturers then tried to resume business. Although it was easy to resume work, hat bodies were difficult to obtain. In desperation, it happened that Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese company, had a large stock of hat bodies, about 100,000 dozen. The manufacturers, in their dilemma, could only purchase from them. In a few months, such a large quantity was almost exhausted, and millions of yuan in legal tender fell into the hands of the Japanese. Therefore, what was nominally a domestic product was actually a Japanese product.</p>
<p>The past of the felt hat industry has been described above, and the future trend is very concerning. If the biggest problem of hat bodies cannot be solved, the felt hat industry, which has been painstakingly built up over the past ten years, will gradually move towards destruction. There is no shortage of enlightened industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai. They should quickly establish pure hat body factories or large-scale hat factories in the interior or Shanghai to alleviate the current emergency. (Zhang Yumei)</p>
<p>(Note) Hat bodies are made from wool or rabbit fur. Because the manufacturing method is complicated and difficult, most factories use hat bodies to make hats.</p>
<h3>Changes in Shanghai's Industry and Commerce Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>(Continued from the 13th) (2) Reopening of Businesses</p>
<p>Thirty-four industrial plants and commercial firms, having suspended operations due to various reasons, soon reopened, including ten factories and twenty-four commercial firms. Among these reopenings, the most significant was the republication of the Shen Bao, a leading newspaper in China with a vital mission. Although now published by the American Columbia Company, it maintains its consistent, unwavering spirit and has become even more proactive. The distribution of these thirty-four reopened businesses by industrial and commercial sector is as follows: Clothing and food industries each had six firms, cultural and electrical/metal industries each had five, and construction, medicine, finance, entertainment, and daily necessities industries each had two. The travel and decoration industries each had one firm. Comparing the number of reopenings by month, March had the highest with eight firms, followed by January, February, May, and September with four firms each, then October with three, and April, June, and December with two firms each. July had the fewest with only one. August and November saw no reopenings. The breakdown of reopened businesses by sector and month is listed in the table below.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: Total Exports and Remaining Stock from Yantai</p>
<p>According to correspondence from Yantai, a large number of northern goods and miscellaneous grains, seafood, medicinal materials, and sundries were shipped to Guangdong, Fujian, Hong Kong, and Shanghai in the 27th year. Here are the total amounts and categories of goods remaining in stock at the end of the year, as determined by a classified survey:</p>

<h3>"Laboring Without Merit"</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Manchester Guardian's commentary on the Sino-Japanese War can be said to be insightful and exceptionally accurate. It stated that although the Japanese army had some victories in the first phase of the war, in reality, it was "laboring without merit" because their "soldiers are all exhausted and frustrated, and the officers are confused and at a loss." It also said that "guerrilla warfare will continue to spread, and the Japanese will be unable to stop it." Therefore, it predicted that the Japanese army would seek peace after a year.</p>
<p>However, we must add some supplementary opinions to the newspaper's statement that Chinese soldiers are comparable to Japanese soldiers, but Chinese officers are inferior to Japanese officers. We all know that "it is easy to find a thousand soldiers, but difficult to find one general." Officers are inherently more difficult to cultivate than soldiers. In the past, we did not intend to invade others, and because of our internal strife, the cultivation of officers with modern knowledge was insufficient, which is undeniable. Some foreign military observers even said that among the senior Chinese officers, only Hu Zongnan, Tang Enbo, Xue Yue, and Sun Lianzhong were qualified to serve as division commanders. Although this view may be too high and lack practical value, it provides further evidence that Chinese officers are not as satisfactory as desired. However, in addition to accelerating the cultivation of officers with modern knowledge, we have other means to compensate for this deficiency: first, we should use guerrilla warfare; second, we should use protracted warfare.</p>
<p>Guerrilla warfare is a net from which no one can escape. No matter how superior the military knowledge of the Japanese officers may be, they will only be "confused and at a loss," not knowing what to do. Protracted warfare is a long-term attrition. No matter what amazing knowledge the Japanese officers may possess, under the judgment of time, their skills will become completely ineffective. In addition, the depletion of their talent will decrease daily, while the cultivation of our talent will increase daily. The talent on both sides will soon have a reasonable ratio, which is an inevitable trend, and our surpassing them is exactly what we expect. Therefore, I believe that our current deficiency in this area is not to be feared.</p>
<p>The Manchester Guardian probably anticipated this point, which is why it made an optimistic prediction for the Chinese side, even though it pointed out this deficiency on the Chinese side. Because the Japanese are excellent in their battlefield strategy, our battlefield tactics of guerrilla warfare and protracted warfare can negate everything and make them pale in comparison. This is a universally recognized fact.</p>
<p>In the first phase of the war, the Japanese were "laboring without merit." I think that just being "without merit" is their good fortune. After this, I can assert that as long as we firmly resist according to the established policy, they will not only be "without merit" but will also "have demerits." Let's wait and see!</p>
<h3>Li Guang Was Known as the Flying General</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——Folk Tales</p>
<p>In the "Yuchuang Qizhen Ji" discovered by the late Ma Lian a few years ago, there is a story called "Li Guang Was Known as the Flying General," which is almost entirely based on Volume 109 of the Records of the Grand Historian, "The Biography of General Li," and Volume 54 of the Former Han Book, "The Biography of Li Guang and Su Jian." It is indeed a very good tragic story. Li Guang defended against the Xiongnu, but he was unlucky and repeatedly failed to achieve merit. Even when he did achieve merit, it could only be used to offset his faults. He followed Zhou Yafu to quell the Wu and Chu rebellions, but because he did not properly bear the general's seal, he did not receive a reward. He defeated the Xiongnu at Shaxi, but because a watching eunuch was shot and killed by the Xiongnu, it was considered his fault, and his merits could only offset his faults. He attacked the Xiongnu at Yanmen, but he was captured by the Xiongnu. Although he escaped, he was demoted to a commoner by the court. All of the above are found in the Han history books.</p>
<p>In order to emphasize the tragic nature of the story, the novel added two more twists and turns to Li Guang's life. Li Guang was humiliated by the governor of Junling, who detained him while traveling at night. When he was reinstated, he executed the governor of Junling. The Han history books say that he executed the governor first and then reported it to the emperor, who praised him and recorded the original text of the imperial edict. However, the novel says that Li Guang defeated the Xiongnu, and "the emperor wanted to promote him, but the family of the governor of Junling went to the palace to accuse Guang of taking revenge for personal grievances. The emperor was angry, used his merits to offset his faults, and made him a commoner again." This is the first twist. The Han history books only say, "Guang's army was defeated and lost its reward." This means that Li Guang "was defeated by the enemy, but he was also able to defeat the enemy, so his merits and faults were equal." But the novel says that he "rode in the car of the Left Worthy King, intending to be unkind, and was brought to trial by the court." As a result, Zhang Qian pleaded for him, and again, "his merits were used to offset his faults, and he was demoted to a commoner." This is the second twist.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the event mentioned in the historical records, where Li Guang followed Wei Qing and Huo Qubing to attack the Xiongnu, but he got lost and missed his appointment, and he committed suicide.</p>
<p>The official histories mention four instances of "bad luck," while the novel adds two more, making it six. This reminds me of the Romance of Xue Rengui's Eastern Expedition, where Xue Rengui's merits were taken by Zhang Shigui, and he was reduced to being a cook. This is also a tragic story, which makes the readers feel indignant, aggrieved, and more sympathetic. I am also reminded of Yu Dayou, who repeatedly defeated Japanese pirates, but Zhao Wenhua stole his credit and even wanted to bring him to trial. The most famous example is Yue Fei, who was killed by Qin Hui at Fengbo Pavilion.</p>
<p>However, we do not need this kind of tragic story now, because we are now in an era of political clarity and strict military discipline, where rewards and punishments are clearly defined. Just look at the executions of Han Fuju and Wang Yizhe, the expulsion of Wang Jingwei from the party, and the commemorations of Yan Haiwen and Yao Ziqing, etc. You can see that the whole country is united and jointly resisting humiliation. The injustices suffered by Li Guang, Yue Fei, and Yu Dayou will not be seen in this world again. Therefore, when we use historical materials to write long novels or Peking opera, we should adopt positive themes, such as "Blood on the Riverbank." Tian Han has also expressed the same opinion in "The War of Resistance and Drama" and has made the same statement at the Shanghai National Salvation Drama Symposium.</p>
<h3>The Development of Satirical Art in Japan</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>From the perspective of human cultural history, the expression of human nature in the arts undoubtedly manifests first in music and painting. Before the advent of the Stone Age and Bronze Age in the visual arts, even among barbarians there existed the most basic music and the most rudimentary painting. This is an undeniable fact, as evidenced by general human history or archaeological history.</p>
<p>What distinguishes humans from other animals, according to the materialistic economic perspective, is the ability to manufacture and use production tools. This view is entirely correct. However, on a phenomenal level, the most prominent difference between humans and other animals is that humans possess something called "culture," which is a synthesis of material and spiritual aspects of human life.</p>
<p>All animals have emotions, but the expression of emotions in animals other than humans cannot deviate from their physiological conditions. For example, horses nuzzling and dogs licking each other can be said to be expressions of their emotions. However, humans, in addition to this physiological expression of emotions, can also use external objects to express emotions that cannot be directly explained by physiology. We believe that the genesis of all art lies in this.</p>
<p>This art, a crystallization of matter and spirit, is like the fire stolen from the gods and brought to mankind by Prometheus. Once this fire arrives among humans, it never goes out. Even during the alternating periods of savagery and darkness in human history, art has always developed along a curved line. The emergence of satirical art lies in the arc-shaped stage of this curved development.</p>
<p>For example, take the current situation in Japan. Under the tyrannical rule of the military, all cultural movements in Japan can be said to have come to a standstill. Cultural movements are tributaries to the pursuit of justice, and justice is incompatible with Japan's "national policy" today. All those engaged in legitimate cultural activities are either tortured and killed or imprisoned. As a result, there is even a strange phenomenon of a shortage of university professors. Those they call "rear-echelon literati" are, at best, hangers-on; in reality, they are nothing more than a pack of lackeys for the warlords. This is not malicious slander; their "writings" are ironclad proof.</p>
<p>But precisely because the fire of Prometheus has been brought to mankind, even if the flames are temporarily extinguished, the embers cannot be extinguished. Therefore, although the fascist military has exerted great pressure on various fields of cultural activity, works such as Tatsuzo Ishikawa's "The Living Soldiers" have emerged in Japanese literature. Although Tatsuzo Ishikawa has expressed "repentance" (as exemplified by "The Battle of Wuhan" in the January issue of "Chuo Koron"), the activities of folk satirical art are very active. In particular, cartoons targeting the so-called "National Mobilization Movement" have managed to escape the attention of censors and have been published in the most popular Japanese newspapers and magazines. Looking at the titles of some of these cartoons, we can sense how full of satire they are. For example, on the theme of "saving" (which has a different meaning from the frugality promoted in China), there are "Lighter Alliance," "Smoking Group," and "Garbage National Army." On the theme of substitutes, there are "Substitute Legislators" and "Fingernail Pens." On the theme of civilian economic mobilization, there are "Wardrobe Reorganization," "Three Memorial Days," "Implementing Family Examples," and "Time Consumption Tax." (Regarding the original drawings, see the reproduced versions in "Magazine" Volume 3, Issues 5 and 6—the latter published on the 16th).</p>
<p>Although the military fascist machine guns are planted all over Japanese soil, this satirical art is a vine sprouting in the midst of the gun forest. Although their initial strength is extremely weak, once they spread and grow, they will surround the gun forest and eventually trip it over, clearing a path for the growth and development of just cultural movements.</p>
<p>News reports indicate that Joseph Goebbels in Germany has noticed that satirical art will jeopardize the existence of fascism, so he has decided to eradicate it. But we firmly believe that the power of Mephistopheles is ultimately incapable of extinguishing the torch of Prometheus. The result will inevitably be like moths flying into the fire, hastening their own demise.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>"Fellow elders, uncles, brothers, sisters, I am now reporting to you some very unfortunate news. Recently, there has been a significant change in the war situation... Our unit, because we are defending our land and resisting the enemy, are unwilling to retreat, so we have lost contact with the rear and become an isolated force. Now, there are still more than a thousand of us in this regiment. We are not all stationed here; most of our supplies depend on local support, which is very regrettable. However, thinking of you, by paying a small amount of money, we can prevent bandits from taking advantage of the opportunity to steal, and you can continue to live and work in peace, which seems very worthwhile. I will strictly restrain my subordinates and not allow them to disturb you, and I will do my best to help you, so as to achieve a close relationship between the army and the people."</p>
<p>Everyone listened to Regiment Commander Ye's words and expressed a welcoming attitude. Chen, the town leader, was the first to speak, expressing his agreement.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Regiment Commander Ye discussed the matter with Town Leader Chen and the local notables and gentry. As a result, it was decided that the Chamber of Commerce would bear 60% of the supplies, and the people would bear 40%. As for the stationed locations, in addition to public temples and ancestral halls, the major households would voluntarily offer their forward houses. Regiment Commander Ye did the same at his own home.</p>
<p>Everything was negotiated, and Regiment Commander Ye then ordered the troops to enter the town. The people had already known about it in advance, so they were not alarmed at all. Some even set off firecrackers. The soldiers, in their orderly and solemn formation, passed through the streets amidst the sound of firecrackers. Although they had been through a long battle, their morale was still very high.</p>
<p>This was truly a new era in Heping Town, because this place was not a strategic location, so it had never been garrisoned by so many troops. At first, there was inevitably some distance between the people and the soldiers, but later they became like a family, and their feelings became closer day by day.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye did not neglect military arrangements for a moment. His headquarters was set up in the township office. When the battalion that was covering the front line was gradually withdrawn, he reorganized the troops according to the actual needs, dividing them into six guerrilla detachments, each detachment with three companies. The detachment commanders were himself, Deputy Regiment Commander Liang, Staff Officer Zhu, and the other three battalion commanders. The company commanders were successively promoted from company and platoon leaders. Two detachments and one company were left in the town, and the rest were deployed in nearby villages and towns. Sentries were posted near the railway and highway lines. In order to prevent the enemy from attacking from the rear, he also controlled all the boats along the lake, prohibiting all civilian ships from sailing out and only allowing fishing boats to fish and purchase supplies in the vicinity.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Regiment Commander Ye started a political training class in the unit, which was run by his younger brother, Fang Ying, and several local educated youths. The first step was to awaken the people, using words, pictures, and dramas to spread propaganda in the town and nearby villages. At the same time, he moved the original military medical office to a larger location and established a rescue squad. His younger sister, Fang Hui, and doctor Jin Chunan, were recruited to participate in the rescue work. However, the source of medicine was very scarce. Although there was cotton, there was very little absorbent cotton and gauze, which was really unavoidable.</p>
<p>The arrival of the army did not affect the daily lives of the people in the town, but what worried them most was that the harvested rice could not be sold at all and had to be left at home. Regiment Commander Ye thought this was very reasonable, and he repeatedly explained the importance of storing grain to everyone.</p>
<p>Town Leader Chen was very impressed with Regiment Commander Ye's arrangements and often praised Regiment Commander Ye in front of his family, saying how handsome and promising he was. He wanted to marry his daughter, Xiuyue, to Regiment Commander Ye, but he did not want to speak up himself. He asked Mr. Yang, the leader of the local council, to inquire about Regiment Commander Ye's father's opinion. Regiment Commander Ye's father seemed to be very supportive, but Regiment Commander Ye refused outright. The reason was simple, only eight words: "The Huns have not been destroyed, how can I have a family!" (18)</p>

<h3>The Ordeal of Xin Yanqiu</h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published a news item titled "Xin Yanqiu Sacrifices for the Nation," sourced from a Reuters dispatch from Beiping on the 20th, stating that several weeks ago, an assassination attempt on Mu Bin at the Jixiang Theater failed, resulting in the on-the-spot death of one Guan Zhenglin. Xin Yanqiu was then arrested by Japanese military police and died in prison. The original dispatch was brief and lacked details. Xin Yanqiu, a frail woman, was able to perform such a heroic act, her will is truly commendable. Ten days ago, a friend of this reporter returned to Shanghai from Beiping to spend the New Year. He spoke to me about this matter, which differed slightly from the Reuters report. Now, following Mr. Xu Muyun, I record it to inform those concerned about the Xin Yanqiu incident.</p>
<p>Feng Zhi'an Goes South, The Actress Stays in Beiping Temporarily</p>
<p>A month before the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, the actress Xin formally married Feng Zhi'an, a subordinate of Song Zheyuan. Song and Feng were both famous anti-Japanese generals. When Pingjin fell one after the other, Feng, finding it inconvenient to bring his family, entrusted Xin Yanqiu and her entire family to Jiang Chaozong for care. He then went south alone to continue his work against the enemy. Subsequently, Jiang Chaozong became the "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of Beiping, interacting frequently with the Japanese. Xin Yanqiu was also coveted by a certain high-ranking Japanese officer, who wanted to marry her. Jiang dissuaded him, and it did not happen. Afterward, Xin lived in seclusion and did not perform on stage. In between, the Japanese side repeatedly invited Xin Yanqiu to perform in "Manchukuo," but Jiang dissuaded her each time. However, the certain high-ranking Japanese officer was quite resentful about his failed attempt to marry Xin Yanqiu.</p>
<p>Assassination of Mu Bin Fails, The Actress Unluckily Imprisoned</p>
<p>On the sixth of this month, there was a grand charity performance in Beiping. People in the Peking opera world, compelled by circumstances, had no choice but to participate. Tickets were also sold by the performers. The performance was held at the Jixiang Theater. Xin Yanqiu and Li Hongchun performed the main act, the play being "The Entire Diao Chan." Unexpectedly, before the Diao Chan play began, gunshots suddenly rang out from the orchestra seats, an assassination attempt occurred. Only one person died (presumably Guan Zhenglin as reported by Reuters). The person next to the deceased was Mu Bin, an important figure in the "Provisional Government." A ticket was found on the deceased's body. Checking its number, it was sold by Xin Yanqiu. Mu Bin also fled the theater immediately. At this time, the theater was in a state of chaos. After a while, Diao Chan took the stage, but three or four tenths of the audience had already left. When the play ended, Xin was captured by Japanese military police before she could remove her costume.</p>
<p>Yanqiu Rescued from the Cage, But Already Covered in Wounds</p>
<p>The next day, Jiang Chaozong interceded with the high-ranking Japanese officer, requesting the release of Xin Yanqiu. At the same time, the Japanese sent people to search Xin Yanqiu's residence (i.e., Jiang Chaozong's home), where they found a letter sent by Feng Zhi'an from ×× on January 22nd. Fortunately, it only contained greetings and did not raise suspicion. Eventually, Jiang Chaozong, with the guarantee of certain two institutions and thirteen well-known Beiping shops, managed to rescue Xin Yanqiu from the cage, but she was already covered in wounds. According to reports, after arriving at the Military Police Headquarters, she was stripped of her clothing, left naked, and whipped. She had almost no words to defend herself. After Xin Yanqiu returned to the Jiang residence, she was so angry that she wanted to die by taking poison, but Jiang's concubine, Xiao Jinhua, stopped her. At the same time, Mu Bin also came to the Jiang residence to express his condolences. Xin glared at Mu and immediately fainted, then she was taken to Xiehe Hospital.</p>
<p>The Ordeal Has Three Causes, Not Death in Prison</p>
<p>Looking at what my friend described, we can know that Xin Yanqiu suffered this strange humiliation for three reasons: first, she refused to perform in "Manchukuo"; second, she rejected the marriage proposal of a certain high-ranking Japanese officer; third, Mu Bin also had designs on Yanqiu (it is rumored that Xin Yanqiu was Mu's mistress, the origin of which probably lies here). As for Feng Zhi'an's letter, it was just an extraneous detail. As for the Reuters report that Xin Yanqiu had died in prison, it can be proven inaccurate, because my friend left Beiping at the time Yanqiu returned to the Jiang residence. Even if Yanqiu has passed away, she did not die in prison, but definitely in Xiehe Hospital.</p>
<p>Xin Yanqiu is the adopted daughter of my teacher Linwu Shanren. Every time she came south, she was closest to me and Brother Chen Dieyi. Mr. Cao Jingtao, the owner of Kan Yun Lou, supported her greatly and even arranged a marriage in Siam, but it did not materialize. Jingtao will be more heartbroken upon hearing this news than me and Dieyi. I will only offer a sincere prayer, hoping that the Reuters dispatch is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>The Performance of the New Type of Dance Drama "Poppy" is Very Exciting</h3>
<p>— Shi De</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Drama Arts Society" performed three one-act plays during this Spring Festival: "Rosalie," "The Mute Wife," and a new type of dance drama "Poppy." The first two are French plays, satires on the general "gentlemanly demeanor" and people who "cut off their nose to spite their face." Because I arrived too late, I did not see them completely, so I will only talk about the last play here.</p>
<p>"Poppy" is an original work by Wu Xiaobang, composed by Chen Genian, and sponsored by the Sino-French Drama Arts School. I am an amateur in both music and dance. Whether the existence of a dance drama on the Chinese stage this time is a creation, please forgive my ignorance, I have no way to "verify." However, I have seen Wu Xiaobang's solo dances several times. From a layman's point of view, dance focuses on the performance of strength. His "Puppet" is still deeply imprinted on my mind. And "Poppy" even more shows the strength of collective power, not to be insulted!</p>
<p>After the fall of Shanghai, the suburbs of Shanghai were almost completely shrouded in the atmosphere of poison. This poisoning policy is part of the enemy's entire conspiracy. On our beautiful land, "windy evenings and rainy mornings, hoping endlessly, enduring hard work, loving freedom, relying on peace, relying on harvest, having no worries about food and clothing for thousands of years," they pulled out "the seeds of wheat, rice, sorghum, and soybeans that we sowed." Implementing the sowing of poisons. In our memory, the "floating corpse case" in Tianjin will never be easily faded! And now they are spreading the sugar-coated policy of "new order" and "revival association." But, "we should not be afraid of hard work and torment, we must cheer up even without sleep." These twenty months of bloodshed are enough to shatter the enemy's illusions. This is the power of the collective! The light of freedom will soon shine on the earth, celebrating our victory around the withered poppy!</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Xiaobang was able to create this "Poppy" dance drama for us, aimed at this problem. This is truly good news during the Spring Festival. As for how the performance was, because I am a layman, I can only say a few layman's words.</p>
<p>"Poppy" is divided into five scenes. The first scene, "Sweating and Wet Backs, We Till the Soil," and the fifth scene, "For the Love and Life, Sow the Flowers and Fruits of Love," may have been rehearsed too hastily, and I felt that the dance steps and music could not be closely coordinated. It was okay when expressing happiness in the first scene, but the fifth scene was not enough to show the power of majesty and beauty. The third scene, "Love Lives Forever in the World," should be the most outstanding scene. Both the music and dance steps can express the spirit of "Love is boiling in our hearts, we appear to sacrifice for love." In the second scene, the lovers and operators, I seem to have seen the shadow of "Puppet" again, but the impression is still not strong enough. The movements of the three characters, Poppy, her brother, and the accomplices, are relatively simple, and they are quite able to portray the collusion of the three-in-one of "ink shirt," "[missing character]" and "making eyes right and left."</p>
<p>Although the rehearsal time was too hasty this time, it is already gratifying that the Sino-French Drama Arts School, which was established not long ago, can have such achievements. I hope they continue to work hard, and we sincerely await the second performance.</p>

<h3>A Conversation with Mr. Li Zhihua About "The Hegemon-King of Chu"</h3>
<p>— (Wang Cilong)</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Li Zhihua's "The Hegemon-King of Chu" masterpiece, which was revealed in the newspaper yesterday, I studied it very carefully and felt that Mr. Li's feelings were very touching. However, Mr. Li may have been confused by a momentary impulse and did not analyze the skills of "The Hegemon-King of Chu" in detail, resulting in several paragraphs that were almost neurotic. Because Mr. Li specifically mentioned a few words I wrote in "Yihua Pictorial," I cannot but take the time to talk to Mr. Li and correct a few of Mr. Li's mistakes at the same time.</p>
<p>The problem is that Mr. Li broke apart my two sentences "advocating war, exhausting the army and using force, advocating peace, benevolence, righteousness, and peace" and put them into another topic to make a grand argument. Mr. Li already knows that "the benevolent prosper, and the hegemon perishes." This is an unchanging truth. Then, from a new perspective, anyone can understand the Hegemon-King's indiscriminate killing of innocents. Mr. Li cannot even shoulder this point of publicizing obligation, and he has to forcibly bring in Yue Fei and Qin Hui to show off his words. Mr. Li should have a clear understanding of history before writing. The Hegemon-King belonged to Western Chu, advocating war, exhausting the army and using force, while Liu Bang belonged to the Great Han, advocating peace, benevolence, righteousness, and peace. This is a struggle between countries, and it cannot be compared with Yue Fei and Qin Hui. You should know that Yue Fei and Qin Hui were figures of the same dynasty, which is extremely inconsistent with the national disputes between Xiang Yu and Liu Bang. Benevolence, righteousness, and peace are the virtues of our China for thousands of years. Further speaking to the present, it is definitely not just a "war" character written by Mr. Li. There is also a "resistance" character above the "war" character. Otherwise, we will not only lose the virtues of our ancestors, but also lose the deep sympathy given by friendly countries, and we will also pay it to the vast ocean. Mr. Li does not write with a correct perspective, but only with his own views - wrong views - to add comments, but instead creates himself as the tail of the invaders, which is very dangerous!</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is such a thing as the Chu-Han Contention in history, and fortunately, when I directed it, I completely based it on the Western Han Dynasty without any changes. Otherwise, not only would I be laughed at by Mr. Li as adding snakes' feet, but I would also be accused of harming the country by Mr. Li. Wouldn't this be a wrong, and adding to the crime, there are no words of sadness, but I always believe that Mr. Li is a loyal heart and not intentional. Otherwise, I can take a break from this. Really, there are too many wrong things this year!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Records of the New Year's Opera Gathering</h3>
<p>— (Chou Cheng)</p>
<p>The Opera Research Association, because the 19th of this month is the Lunar New Year's Day, which is also a Sunday, a rare good festival, announced to its members in advance that it would hold the third issue of the opera gathering. In order to increase interest, it was stipulated that the plays sung by each member on that day must not be the roles they usually sang. For example, those who usually sang female roles must change to singing male or clown roles, and those who usually sang old male roles must change to singing female or young male roles, as if they were cross-dressing. I went there at 4 pm. Zhou Wentong and his wife, Ms. Xu Huizhu, were singing "Xiao Yan." Zhou played Emperor Tang Ming, and Xu played Yang Guifei. Their voices were loud and their pronunciation was accurate. The happiness of the couple was better than painting eyebrows. No wonder Zhou Bangjun's wife was listening attentively beside them, smiling. Then, the master of Letian and the master of Hongdouguan, with their burly figures and [missing character] fist guards, played Lu Zhishen; the master of Hongdouguan, with his white hair and childlike face, and long beard hanging down his chest, played the old monk; Mr. Wang Jiean, a native of Wu, with a Suzhou accent, played the wine seller, which can be called a natural match, and is hard to find. Others, such as the "Jian Niang" by Mr. Shen Hengyi and Mr. Pu Xiyuan, the reverse singing of Guan Gong by Mr. Zhu Yaowen, the reverse singing of "The Training of Guan Ping" by the master of Letian, the reverse singing of storytelling by Mr. Li Mengzou's wife, Ms. Xia Xunru, and the reverse singing of "Sharpening the Axe" by Mr. Peng Zhimin, were all very beautiful. Then, there was the "Si Fan" by the master of Hongdouguan, an old man with white hair, performing a young female nun. Her voice was like a chickadee out of the valley, and her figure was like a willow in the wind, which was really rare and valuable. The "Ting Hui" by Mr. Gu Chuanjie and the "Ci Hu" by Mr. Zhang Chuanfang can be called pure fire and green, and are enough to be old masters of the wheel. The "Sao Hua" by Mr. Zang Zibin, his pronunciation of the words was meticulous, accurate and exceptional, is a rare one among the Qingke. Paired with the "Ke Xiangu" by the master of Hongdouguan, they complemented each other. By the time the meeting was dismissed, the bell had struck ten o'clock.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden in the Former Capital (111)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>"Heavenly Thunder Retribution" and "A Handful of Snow" are all plays written by the actors themselves</p>
<p>"Heavenly Thunder Retribution" was originally a work play performed by male and old female roles in Han classes, but later it was taken over by Pi Huang classes, and now it has become a famous play of the Tan school. When Old Tan first performed this play, Zhang Po was originally played by Zhou Changshun. Zhou was a famous old female role at that time, so the performance was very brilliant. After Changshun died, Tan looked around the old female role line and there was no one who could take his place, so the clown Wang Changlin played Zhang Po in reverse, known as Yu Shuyan, the successor of the Tan school, and Ma Lianliang, who is in the male role line today, also often posted to perform this play; and the old female role was all played by Wang Shuanzi. In fact, Yu and Ma's "Heavenly Thunder Retribution" are all supported by Changlin, so this old man is the most suitable, and the performance has the wonderful effect of complementing each other.</p>
<p>The meaning of this play originally contains the elements of teaching through religion. Its popularity among the people is as deep as the famous play "Zhu Hen Ji" of the Cheng school in the minds of women and children. However, the names of "Heavenly Thunder Retribution" and "Zhu Hen Ji" are not as popular as the names of "Lei Da Zhang Jibao" and "Mu Yang Juan", because the villagers do not understand the written words very well, so they can only remember some simple play names, and they all know that this is a performance of the true story of a man and a woman being struck to death by thunder. Therefore, whenever parents encounter an unfilial son, or a village produces an unvirtuous woman, they will always take the disobedient son Zhang Jibao and Zhu Chundeng's aunt to talk about it. (To take someone as a story means to use someone as an analogy)</p>
<p>According to what I heard from an old Guqu performer, Zhang Jibao was not only not struck to death by thunder, but on the contrary, he was a very filial person and a very honest official. Just imagine, how could there be such a conscience-stricken person in the world? He was taken in by Zhang Lao when he was young, and the old couple made straw shoes and ground small mills, and it was not easy to raise this boy for more than ten years. Later, he was recognized by his birth mother, and soon he became the top scholar. When he passed by Qingfeng Pavilion, his adoptive father and adoptive mother asked him to adopt them, but he not only turned his face and refused to recognize them, but also forced his benefactress to death, and only rewarded his adoptive father with two hundred copper coins.</p>

<p>According to the game proposed by Mr. Xue, there are quite a few highlights. Chariot Eight to Three, protecting the kill and killing back, is thought-provoking. Horse Six Advance Four, there is such a slow move in the midst of busyness. Although it does not kill continuously, it is equal to continuous killing. The structure is subtle, and it is deeply understood to be like the game. It can be called wonderful.</p>
