<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本進攻海南島的用意</h3>
<p>日軍自從佔領了廣州以後，就揚言要大舉進攻西南。可是陸軍方面，三路碰壁，反而陷入包圍，無法衝破。海軍軍艦徘徊東京灣進出瓊州海峽也已經好久了，沒有什麼動作，但本月十日却突然在海南島登陸，企圖把中國沿海第一大島加以佔領。</p>
<p>海南島面積三萬三千方公里，五指山脈滿佈全島；祗有沿海地方，比較平坦，有公路環繞全島。此决日軍進攻目標在北部的瓊山跟瓊山外面的海口港；但海口沙灘滿佈，平時的商船也不許停靠，因此日軍在島東的淸瀾港跟島北的臨高港兩處登陸，分兩路沿公路會攻瓊山跟海口。海口和雷州半島的海安所祗相距二十多公里，日軍佔領該地，當然對廣東的南部威脅性很大。然而日軍要進攻西南，應該併力攻略北海，纔可以挺進邕寗，扼西南的心臟，何必這樣的捨近求遠，把孤懸在南海裏的海南島來做根據地呢？老實說，自從廣州失陷以後，海南島在中國的防務上已失去其重耍性，這一點日本當局又何嘗不知道。所以她的攻略海南島，决不是一種進攻南中國的軍略而另有其重要的作用。</p>
<p>原來海南島和法屬越南只隔一衣帶水，日軍如果佔領該島，對於法國的遠東殖民地不啻一個最嚴重的壓迫，可使法國在越南的防務，完全失去效用。同時海南島又是南海的樞紐，從海南島連結英領新加坡和美領菲列賓，可以畫成一個扇面形，這扇面地帶包挾英，荷，美領南洋羣島的全部，而扇柄的一端就是海南島。所以日軍佔領海南島，目的簡直是想做南海的盟主，顯然是在向全世界各國挑戰</p>
<p>目前歐洲方面，義大利正拚命逼迫法國，西班牙局勢十分惡化，使法國臨到一個最嚴重的難關；德國也正躍躍欲試，耍向法國淸算幾世紀來的陳賬。日本乘這個時會進攻海南島，彷彿說如果歐戰爆發，日本就可以越過這衣帶水佔領越南、如同二十四年以前佔領靑島一樣容易，可說是一宗最佔便宜的投機買賣；如果歐戰一時還不至於爆發，而日本對遠東的控制力則己經加强，不但海防西貢巳放在貪狼的口邊，就是新加坡馬尼刺，也耍感到寢不安枕，這在日本方面當然自以爲是一舉數得的勾當。</p>
<p>然而日閥儘管做着美夢而美夢終究是難圓的。第一，海南島不會給日閥輕易佔領。中國千百年來和黎族的密切接觸，及南宋末年民族奮鬥的敎訓，已使瓊崖同胞做成了中華民族最英勇，最機警，最耐苦，最富於民族性的分子。日軍在海南島一登陸，在五指山麓立刻就會展開游擊戰，替日本海軍在南中國再挖掘一處新墳墓。試想日軍即使佔領了瓊山，能夠完全佔領沿海各地嗎？即使盡佔沿海各地，能夠完全控制五指山脈嗎？所以日軍這一决的舉動，又無異於多找一個兵力消耗的地方，不久必然會自覺這是一種作繭自縛的蠢舉。</p>
<p>第二，因了海南島事件世界各民治國也必然會對日本有更進一步的認識，將起而作更切實的制裁。英法各國因爲遠東問題對日抗議已不止一次了，可是事實證明紙面上的抗議一點也沒有用處。一九〇七年的法日協定，也被日本這一舉動所撕毀了。她們得了多回的敎訓，難道這次還會斯文作態，跟日本打筆墨官司嗎？報載巴黎政府對於海南島事件擬不提抗議，這其實就是要取抗議以上實力舉動的暗示，决不是一種對暴力的默認。此外英國美國，到了此時恐怕也非奮起團結，制裁這世界的惡魔不可。所以西班牙巴塞羅納港的陷落，會促成各民治國對歐態度的一致。中國海南島的被佔，也必然地會促進英法美對遠東行動的團結而强化。我們敢預料日本在海南島上的如意算盤是打不成的！</p>
<p>軍地位相抗、則爲顯而易見之事實、故日軍之在海南島登陸、其目的顯僅欲迴轉國內與國際對共目前在華所遭遇種種困難之法意耳、新華日報深信日軍之佔據海南島、足以威脅越南新加坡菲律濱之地位、法英美三國或不能容忍此舉、惟中國不得依賴國外之發展以應付大局、而當加强華南之防務、以止日軍侵入西南、並常竭力維持西南各省之交通、掃蕩報謂海南島漢時卽加入中國版圖、迄今已一千六百餘年矣、國民政府曾定發展該島之計畫、而因對日抗戰、未能實現、日軍佔據該島、不僅侵略中國之土地、且直接危害法英兩國在太平洋之地位、大公報曰、海南島固爲重要海軍根據地、但中國無海軍、故日軍佔有、與中國抗戰前途無關、惟法國其仍將寂然對之乎、日本一再保證不危害第三方面之利益、試問其保證安在乎、（十一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>日軍在海南島登陸　外報嚴辭詆責　佔據理由不能成立業已違反條約約束</h3>
<p>（巴黎）日軍在中國海南島登陸事、此間各報、一致嚴詞加以詆責、咸謂日本業已違反的束、而以威脅加諸法屬越南、右派巴黎迴聲報載稱、「日本政府所援引之理由、絕對不能成立、法國政府定必提出極强硬的抗議、他國亦必出此同樣行動、中日兩國戰事之結束、仍遙遙無期、吾人與戰塲相距甚遠、儘有從容應付之時日、」右派晨報亦謂、法國政府定必提出抗議、右派斐伽羅報載稱、「英法兩國政府、業於交換意見之後、决定向日本政府、提出抗議、蓋在去歲六月二十七日、英國外務部次官白特勒、會向下議院宣稱、英法兩國政府、業已飭令各該國駐日大使、明白通知日本政府、該國若果佔據海南島、則英法即認爲故意引起不愉快的糾紛之行爲、英法兩國爲適應時局需要計、卽當互相援助、毫無疑義、」此項聲明、迄今依然有效、右派日報載稱「日軍之在海南島登陸、其惟一目標、乃爲準備切斷滇越鐵路、亦即中國所得外來接濟所剩途徑之一、」特在此際提出正式抗議、似不適宜、曷若採取警戒態度、並會同英國注視今後如何發展、因此島爲日本所佔、則英國感受威脅之程度、實與法國相等故也、其他各報、則以日軍在海南島登陸、與西班牙國民軍佔據地中海米諾加島相提並論、急進社會黨事業報載稱、「此兩事者顯係德義日三角同盟循沉實施其計劃之明證、計劃維何、即威脅英法兩民洽國之交通綫、以陷英法於不利是也、」急進社會黨共和報載稱、英法兩國調處西班牙內戰一項企圖極爲德義兩國所不滿、「日本軍隊在海南島登陸事、或即反共產國際公約簽宇三國、經互相協商而採取之報復手段、正未可必、」右派小日報載稱「日軍對於海南島若作久據之計、卽係遝反華府九國公的之又一舉動、美國以九國公的發起者之資格、自當率先宜吿此的已遭破壊、對日應有所主張、或有所行動、或則與之進行談判、」（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日軍在中國海南島登陸之後、此間負責人士頃宣稱、法國政府當向日本政府提出交涉、吿以法國禁止軍火經由法屬越南運往中國、原望日本放棄其對於海南島之企圖、以爲交換條件、加之法日兩國會經商定關於海南島一項問題、任何舉動、凡不利於對方者、均當予以避去、法國於此自必振振有辭、英法兩國且當採取共同立塲、從而考慮共同行動、亦有可能、但當注視發展情形、並等待日本說明意向之後、始乃正式有所决定、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>試探英法合作程度</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）據美國政府方面今日表示、日本若將海南島永久加以佔領、且在該島布置海空軍之根據地、則必將使西太平洋之軍略地位、完全改觀、故美國至此、勢將被迫而加强其在太平洋之防禦力量、其中關島則將立即武裝起來、蓋海南島去菲島不過六百英哩、同時又鄰近法屬安南與英之香港、足使美英法在遠東之根據地、咸蒙威脅、（十日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日軍在中國海南島登陸事、頃由美國負責人士加以評論、咸謂此乃政治上一種姿勢、用以試探英法兩國對於遠東事件態度、是否堅决、抑或失之軟弱、日本乃係反共公的簽字國、其派兵在海南島登陸、且欲測騐英法恊商其抵抗力如何、此在美國、則因該島係屬中國領土之故、不擬出以何項外交行動、或作其他表示、（十日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（柏林）日軍在中國海南島登陸之後、此間政界人士甚表歡欣、咸謂此决乃日本對於「西方各民治國某種恫嚇計畫」所提出之答復、其在軍略上外交上之意義旣屬重大、且足以阻遏中國之軍火接濟、（十一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）日軍在中國海南島登陸事義國方面甚爲注意、頃由各報加以評論、咸謂此舉對於中日戰事未來發展情形、殆有决定的力量、該島在軍略上保有種種優點、日軍可憑藉之以阻各國輪船駛近中國海、而使英屬香港島與法國租借地廣州灣兩處根據地、失其效用、日軍在該島登陸之前、會以此意一預先通知義德兩國政府、（十一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>五十萬靑年男女　在後方為國服務　錫山　從事宣傳救護工作情緒熱烈工作緊張　在苦幹中求民族解放</h3>
<p>重慶通訊，自七七事件發生以來的十九個月中，最使中國靑年感到光榮的，是在救國工作上的勝利，這不僅是得到了全國人士的同情，同時更獲得了全世界人士的贊揚，自從中國全面抗戰的開始，中國的靑年們，的確是幹了很多實際的救國工作，這散佈在內地各區域的五十餘萬靑年男女，從仟何方面說來，他們的精神，都足以表顯對於國家的熱忱。</p>
<p>事實上，在這全面抗戰之下，每一個靑年，他們都已覺得自己責任的重要，他們由着熱血情緒的激動，已耐不住再呆坐在敎窒中，於是他們離開了學校，一部分的靑年，很勇敢的跑上了火錢，他們參加正式的軍隊，或組起了小單位的游擊隊，從事直接抗敵的工作，最好的例子，便是天津。北平各地的靑年大學生。大部份的靑年男女，他們雖沒有站在前錢作戰，但他們是很忙碌的後方服務着。</p>
<p>在重慶·成都·長沙·西安這許多區域裹，許多政治上的宜傳工作，受傷戰士的救護工作以及收容難民的工作，今日已完全的由靑年們在擔任着，最使人敬佩的是來自下江一帶的靑年們，他們在上海一向是過着很舒適的大都市生活，而今日在內地服務着，他們不僅感不到生活的不舒，而且服務的精神更有勝於他人之點。</p>
<p>值得吾們提出的，是靑年婦女參加抗戰工作的努力，在內地的許多醫院中，都是女學半們在擔任着看護傷兵的工作，最好的現象，她們都把受傷的戰士當作爲自己的弟兄一般，她們跟他們談話，慰間。寫家信·唱歌·唸讀戰事的消息，她們有一句口號說，『减少傷兵苦痛，恢復傷兵健康，是吾們的第一責任』！</p>
<p>（女子救護隊出發情形</p>
<p>許多的靑年婦女，也同樣的受着軍事訓練，她們穿起了戎裝，剪短了的頭髮，在太陽初升的時候，她們已整隊的背着槍桿在廣塲上操練着。</p>
<p>在重慶的每一個大學或中學，每星期至少有八小時以上的軍事學科，他們平時的生活，全是軍事化，上堂·進膳·起牀·上操·全在同一的紀律下過着，在郊外，時常有一隊隊年靑的學生軍隊，在作着野戰的演習。敏捷而正確的動作，象徵着每一個都是未來的勇敢的</p>
<p>在宣傳工作方面，他們是擴大的從事着，同時許多學校的敎授們，亦帮同的參加他們最高的目標，是要提高一般人民的智識，以加强而鞏尙民衆愛國的情緒，他們决定了四個方針來推動這一個工作：　敎會不識字的大衆去寫和讀。　啟發大衆的救國思想。　訓練農民改良耕種和手工業的生產。　訓練人民怎樣來組織自己，以抵抗侵略，在這個計劃下，有許多的靑年們，從事着各種不同的方式來完成這個目的，他們分隊分區的跑到各鄕村各城市去，組織了戲劇和歌詠旅行團，在各地表演着救亡的話劇，並且敎大衆唱救亡的歌曲，大衆歌曲作曲家的劉良模君，他領導了許多的靑女男女，在長沙各地工作着，這些包含着高意識的現實宣傳的手段，是喚醒了大衆的抗戰意志</p>
<p>在成都的許多大學生，他們組織農村服務團，利用着假期，在附近的各農村工作着，他們創設臨時學校和民衆夜校，召集附近的農民來讀書，組設了流動圖書館，旅行講演　，講述戰時常識如防空·防毒·以及急救。在去年的夏季，重慶各大學的學生，包括復旦大學，中央大學，曾相繼組織，各省經濟考察團，（亦有加入當局組織的經濟考察團）。至貴陽及西南各省考察，都有相當的成績。</p>
<p>在西北抗戰大學，有許多的靑年男女，在困苦的生活中訓練着，他們每屆畢業的學員，都分配在各地領導着重耍的抗戰工作，總計已有五六千人之多。</p>
<p>其次在重慶，於宋美齡女士的領導之下，有數百的靑年婦女，也正在訓練中，她們也將負擔起特殊的後方工作。</p>
<p>綜合着說：這一年餘來，中國靑年們在抗戰救亡的工作上，是緊張的，是成功的，每個內地服務着的靑年，他們不光是熱情，而是在實際的苦幹，他們中間沒有個人，而是互相的愛護着團體。在艱苦的爭鬭下，他們希冀打開一條新路，求得眞正的民族解放！</p>
<h3>推進後方建設中　今日之貴陽（續）</h3>
<p>出版事業，定期刋物有省政府公報，新大夏月刊，抗敵週刊，建國評論等十種之多，重慶的雜誌亦都能在三天後迅速的見到。再講到報紙方面，原有貴州晨報，革命日報二種，平版機印，自武漢淪陷，武漢日報更名貴陽中央日報，遷筑出版，省立圖書館，是此地唯一完備的精神糧食館，藏書約五萬冊，雜誌二百餘種，報紙四十多種，然而貴陽市菜館旅館是這麽多，精神的菜館祇此一家，怎够滿　許多食慾健吒的讀者，所以要求教育當局充當圖書，增設圖書閱覽處的呼籲，報紙上常可以看到。此外有省立民衆敎育館一所，那裏也有日報及雜誌，每夜在廣塲上並放映敎育·防空·防毒電影，這對於民衆知識的灌輸收到很大的效果。戲劇運動在貴陽很蓬勃，有狼火·沙駝·大夏八九個業餘劇團，他們多數是學校學生，平均每月總有一個劇團上演。書業如商務·中華·世界·正中·北新·生活都有分店，道裹祇有書不漲價，僅依定價加二分運費。自去年年底起省政府成立廣播電臺一所，每日下午六時起開始廣播。</p>
<p>交通情形　有衛生試騐所，醫院除省立醫院，南京中央醫院也新遷來此，設備藥品較完善，對病家自方便不少，市內的交通有公共汽車，後以營業不振而歇業，所以現祇有人力車與眉與。又貴陽爲川黔，滇黔，桂黔，湘黔公路的中心，交通部西南公路運輸管理局就在此地，車站在中山門外，每日四路均開通車一次，至重慶對岸海棠　　價二〇·五〇元，至昆明二九·一五元，柳州為二七·八〇元，至長沙四四·四〇元，而今至重慶昆明旅客太擠，購票均須依次先登記，而這候缺的登記都已到今春三月了。尙有建設廳公路局汽車專開貴定（貴陽至定陽至比節）公路的區間車。除了公路汽車，騾馬的馱運却亦是重要交通工具，十數匹馬從別的縣份運來鍋呀，木材呀，磚呀，貴陽需要的東西，回去的時候又載去鹽咧，糖咧，火柴咧，別個縣份日常應用的物品，趕馬的人終年的生活，就是野餐露宿，偉大的耐勞刻苦的靭性，眞値得人敬佩。新近中航公司渝筑復航，每星期一·三·五來往對開三次，這使璽慶與貴陽的距離更短了。電話全市計亦有三百門，中國旅行社在西南服務的成績，很獲得好學，除了與西南公路局合作在西南公路上辦理餐站宿站，在這裏省政府委托他辦了一個招待所，所的性質等於旅社，陳設淸潔而簡單，內有乒乓，球藝，過筑的中委參政員每就下榻在招待所。全市有二家電影院，黔陽大舞臺爲川戲，平劇塲有余筑大　　。</p>
<p>社會動態　物產以煤最豐富，沿公路簡　俯拾卽得，所以土著用煤都是自已土法提鍊，鐵與木材的產量，都很可觀，銀耳極便宜，當地的人並不當珍品視之。一個初來貴陽的人一入市郊。就可看到許多觸目的美術字體的標語，國立藝專過境替畫了不少巨幅油畫漫畫張貼在街頭，政治部少年劇團六十多個小朋友，他們走過一萬多里路，這次在貴陽過年，雖然匆匆幾日，他們的努力却留下一個不磨的印象。貴陽年春男女的第二期戰地工作服務團已出發在前綫了，快寒假了，學生們已都在組織農村宣傳隊，預備深入到每一個角落里去。由貴陽向外圍推動的寒衣獻金纔呈解二十萬，而響應上海的一元還債運動又在迅連展開，義賣運動更瘋在了全市，各業至少在舉行一天義賣，貴陽醫師的義診獻金在幾業界錄下光榮的一天。這些都是每個人愛國熱晴和支持這愛國熱情的意忐的綜合結果。在這些地方，貴陽是顯得太年輕了。平常每個人都是在　肅的工作着，在街上能看到每個行人臉上都咄着一種堅定的笑。</p>

<p>我國政府査禁棉花運滬、戰區棉花、受日僞統制後、上海租界區域內華商紗廠、不得已訂購外棉三十萬擔、已分批裝輪運滬、供給各廠紡棉紗之用、戰後紗廠畸形發展、去年均獲厚利、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>各地產棉無法運滬　棉業向集中於上海、蓋上海乃棉花之最大消費地、爲最大之交易市塲、戰後我國政府因上海淪陷後、禁止棉花運滬銷售、以致陝·川·贛·浙·湘·等省產棉、無法運滬戰區冀·魯·曁蘇·浙·皖·各地棉花、受日僞統制影響、運滬數量銳减、運日及關東租借地朝鮮台灣者激增、去年寬達一百二十一萬七千四百七十一公祖、値國幣八千九百八十九萬六千七百十七元、</p>
<p>廠商訂購外棉調節　上海租界區各華商紗廠因各地棉花運滬銳减、以致紡織原料、有缺乏之虞、不得已向巴西·印度·埃及·美國·等處訂購洋棉、據新聲社記者昨向紗業方面探悉、總共訂購外棉的三十萬担、業已分批裝運來滬、預定五月底以前可以到齊、係供給各紗廠紡紗之用、已有五萬擔由巴西·印度·運抵上海、允以巴西棉花爲最多、</p>

<p>上海紗廠日商最多　上海之外商紗廠、英商怡和·公益·楊樹浦·綸昌·等四家錠子四萬四千六百十六枚、布機三千二百六十五台、日商日華·上海·內外·同興·公大·大康·豐田·裕豐·東華等二十四家、錠子一百三十二萬四千一百四十枚、布機一萬四千五百五十四台、英紗完全供給英廠織布之用、日紗傾銷戰區、及供上海各中外棉織廠之用、去年獲利雖厚、但較華廠爲少、</p>
<p>交易日增價格漸漲　滬市紗銷、在戰事爆發後數月、殊爲蕭條、前年九月僅成交三千二百三十包、後以沿海及內地交通、略見鬆動、上海各織布廠陸續開工、於是消費旣多、交易日增、去年六月成交二萬零九百包、十一月成交二萬零零八十三包、銷路以內地如廣東·雲南·浙江·及同行爲最多、價格二十支金鷄、在前年七月爲二百八十八元、日前已漲至四百零三元、</p>

<h3>金融华北外银行　又在猛吸外</h3>
<p>中西商等競相拋塞結果所緊尚不甚劇</p>
<p>滙市昨以有利銀行代華北外商銀行界、力吸不已、兼各大洋行亦追隨扒結、致潛勢頗緊、計英金一度退爲八便士一二五滙豐維持價、美滙亦會軟至十五元八七五、然卒以港電曁沙遜及紗花帮等競相拋塞、故結果所緊尙屬不劇、中途稍有起伏、交易頗旺、港滙亦因外商行買與蓬勃、故狀况續軟、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期縮〇六二五、遠期亦降一二五、紐約現貨、依然勿動、倫敦生金亦無升降、滙兌英對美縮一厘三、對法求更、對滬跌〇六二五、美對英降二五、對法縮〇六二五、對滬平平、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行早開、現貨賣價、英滙八便士一四〇六二五、美滙十五元九〇六二五、較前英美均緊〇三一二五、開後有利突代華北外銀行與洋行、爭先猛吸滙豐麥加利美行及其他外銀行等英金祗八便士一二五及美滙僅十五元八七五、故狀况頗軟、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉小〇·二五、計徵百分之六·〇〇、此後有利雖仍來力吸、但以港電曁西商沙遜及華銀行與紗花帮等賣意頗濃、致潛勢遂轉鬆硬、港電沙遜紗花帮華銀行賣予荷蘭華比有利英金八便士一四〇六二五、兼美滙十五元九〇六二五、最銀行與錢兌業港滙五十四元半、市况亦緊、迨午收銀行賣價、英滙八便士一四○六二五、美滙十五元九〇六二五、結果較前收英美均緊〇三一二五、港亦軟一二五、午後週六無市、茲將半天做開交易錄後、</p>
<h3>津帮重來搜購　現金價又見向勞</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、盤旋續昂、蓋外滙受華北外商銀行扒結下、驟見緊軟、致乃引起天津各帮託某錢兌業力進不懈、月同時本市殷富與北帮等暗中亦活動吸購、然幸賴銀樓帮曁金號及錢兌業等供意尙殷、故當天所漲有限、唯中途仍少變化、各方人心堅穩、交易與上日相仿、銀摟飾金晨初掛大一元、海關金曁中英純金等重趨呆定、</p>
<h3>烚赤軋漲六元</h3>
<p>自晨每條十兩、初開某錢兌業即喊二千〇四十八元買進、銀樓帮要五十元方肯供售、其時外匯受平津外商銀行扒結下、潛勢頗緊、故而買方進意遂濃、首見某錢兌業進銀樓帮百兩、及金號五十兩、均二千〇五十元爲開盤價、開後北帮亦跟踪購買、進銀樓帮五十兩、價五十二元、繼之某錢兌業又來搜購、進銀樓帮五十兩、價五十一元、又進銀樓帮及金號各五十兩、價均五十元、後相同價北帮又進銀樓帮五十兩、錢兌業進銀樓幣五十兩、價五十二元、此後外　經　電習西商拋塞後、略見回硬、且另一錢兌業代客帮出錢、故價遂下挫售予某錢兌業百兩、價五十元、（聞某錢兌業所進大致均代津帮）後銀樓帮售予錢兌業五十兩、價五十二元爲午收價、午後首由錢兌業互做五十兩、價五十二元、此後供求頓稀、價亦呆定、迫至三時半許、某銀樓忽與買風、奈其時售者奇缺、故抬高至五十四元、乃由某銀樓進錢兌業五十兩、此　某銀樓雖續有進意、然售者更形難找、致未做開、故晚收仍爲二千〇五十四元、照上日軋漲六元、（全天四元差度）、現金號之本牌金售出價二千○六十元、收進二千〇四十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<h3>飾金掛大一元</h3>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、晨開因鑒於烚赤潛勢堅穩、故即掛大一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百〇八元、新同行亦改懸二百〇六元、收進二百元、</p>
<h3>純金呆定不動</h3>
<p>十日倫敦電、英純金每盎司未更、仍屬七鎊八先令三辨士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦呆定一千二百十元〇六角、掛牌海關金勿動、仍爲二元三角九分二厘、上海標準標金價亦隨之未動、仍計一千二百〇五元九角、</p>
<h3>外幣上升者多</h3>
<p>咋日英純金未動，英美滙兌降二五、外滙結款稍旺、銀行供給未暢、市價中途軟弱、後港電稍拋塞、鈸行賣意尙爽、市價回平、與前晚無榮辱、週六下午無市、烚赤開盤尙平、後散戶漸起吸納、津帮微有購入、金號錢兌業等供給不多、籌碼稍形缺乏、市價又呈高漲、下午交易稀少、趨勢緊挺、外幣因匯票一度軟弱、烚赤堅挺、殷富稍有吸納、市價微升、門市交易尙盛、公會交易未做開、昨日市價、英金票升八分、美余票升半分、香港票升二厘、法郞票升半厘、加拿大票升六分半、義大利票降二分、其他各幣多數未更動、</p>
<h3>貼現站定</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、一度昂升、但甫高卽見回平、每千元由三十五元曾升至三十五元半、但不久即見回平、最後二十五元、與上日價仍同、</p>
<h3>大條近遠回降　印銀現長期縮</h3>
<p>十日倫敦、投機家賣出、市面平、收盤後仍平、大條銀近期回縮零六二五、遠期亦回縮一二五、紐的銀電、美銀價依然呆定、叉孟買銀電、印銀差參、現貨回長一安那、近期續跌一安那、遠期則降二安那、</p>
<h3>證券　海南牽動　海上債市</h3>
<p>尚有兩天交易</p>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日趨勢突又轉變、債市因日軍竟實行在海南島登陸之警報、此舉對於英法等國殖民地、受到極大之威脅、同時中國之國際交通綫、亦感到甚大之危機、不得不認爲有重大意義、此舉是否故作威脅、以逼迫各該國出而用强調的調解中日問題、以遂其求和之初衷、而各國是吾受其牽制、甘作傀儡、抑竟發生報復行爲、均未可知、但公債已受到意外之打擊、正在一鼓作氣趨漲時、竟已未再而衰、茲事體大、前途之演變若何、未可逆料、公債處此危疑震撼之際、其波動必較前爲鉅大也、</p>
<p>昨日經過、初開似尙安定、因永康及信豐永仍有買進、俄而恊大號有太量拋售、搖撼不定之人心、頓因此遽起跌風、同康號及散戶亦均傾向賣出、價乃愈覺不支、甲種適在抽籤以後、一般未能僥倖之思、要多數賣出、故半日間劇跌一元餘、其他各種亦小五六角、午後協大仍不斷賣出、爲數亦湧、市上祇天生及永康號稍有買進、散戶則進多出少、市價繼續趨疲、惟乙種因有連籤關係、係吃戶較多、初會稍稍趨堅、終以供過於求而下落、市價經此重大打擊、人心渙散而兼疑懼、一時殊不易抬頭也、踪計市價結果、一致跌落、計小六角半至一元二角半、成交總數的計八九十萬元、九六無成交、好在債市只有明後兩天生意、變化當屬不巨也、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、有大中華火柴公司股成交一百股、價爲十二元六角、餘無成交、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月十日（星期五）掛牌行市、張勢已吿平定、而英金善後公債英發債票反見回縮半鎊、價爲四十八鎊半、其餘均無變動、英倫實貨供求、買方於英金善後公債英發債票有三千鎊進冒、出價四十八鎊五先令、照市微抑五先令、賣出則有湖廣鐵路公債德發有印債票一千鎊、售價十九鎊十五先令、照市抑五先令、又廣九鐵路公債一千六百鎊、售價十八鎊半、照市抑落一鎊半、又中法美金五釐公債二千鎊（卽美金一萬元）售價六十九鎊五先令、照市抬一鎊五先令、目前行市、雖見提高、但脚地仍欠堅穩、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月十日（星期五）掛牌行市、銀行股又吿上升、麥加利銀行股續升二先令六便士、價爲九鎊十五先令、匯豐銀行英倫註册股上升一鎊、價爲八十二鎊半、又香港註册股上升一鎊半、價爲八十五鎊、朝鮮礦務股縮小六便士、價爲六先令六便士、其餘均無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　日侵海南島　紗業顧慮華南銷路</h3>
<p>浮多爭先出售　市價跌三四元</p>
<p>紗市趨疲、日跌勢較熾、客銷異常岑寂、各帮皆無活動氣象、實則年內時期爲日無多目行駛船隻亦有數日停頓、航班僅一二决、於是實需愈見减色、同時有一部份人因日軍在海南島登陸、顧慮以後對於紗銷南華一帶、恐生影響、一般浮多稍能贏利者、突來競爭出售、但額子雖未湧旺、然在此結束之際、早已頭襯軋好、接受者允感缺乏、市價步步下降、同行可做交易更稀、至於囤戶連朝拖進、爲額殊巨、暫時亦無心思、而某棉業公司每日在市賣出、將多額斬結、預備結賬、因之檯面又鬆一步矣、</p>
<h3>實銷祇一百餘包</h3>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤尚屬和平、但同業相聚皆屬空談、因客帮實際胃口呆滯、大都無電報來辦貨、故多說無交易、開價二十支雙馬勿動、成交十五包、價爲四百元、少頃同行散戶鑒於生意淸澹、加之海南島形勢又緊、一時賣戶擁擠、市槃步步下落、人氣轉虛弱、最後二十支雙馬價做到三百九十七元半，棧單最小價爲三百九十三元半、結果上午成交統計僅四百六十二包、售價二十支雙馬紗比上日價跌二元，特金城跌四元、雙地球跌四元、天女跌二元、十支粗紗未曾做開、廠方亦未開出、今日有紗二十五件運福州、一百四十件運汕頭、二十件運香港、三百七十件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　三四〇　溫州　三〇</p>
<p>福建　三〇　香港　二〇</p>
<p>寗波　三　汕頭　二〇</p>
<p>雲南　二　統計　四六三</p>
<h3>日紗令人無進出</h3>
<p>日紗市情、依然呆滯如故、各方需要完全入於停頓狀態中、因此市價無甚進出、與上日相仿、二十支水月現紗價爲三百二十六元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百二十一元至二十二元云、</p>
<h3>美棉週末統計</h3>
<p>紐約電、去年八月一日起至今年二月十日止、美棉統計列左、</p>
<p>（單位包每包五百磅）</p>
<p>本季上市累計　七七〇、〇〇〇</p>

<p>全世界供給　九、四三九、〇〇〇</p>
<p>其中美棉　七、二三、〇〇〇</p>
<p>八月一日起　全世界提用美棉　六、二五三、〇〇〇</p>
<h3>海防運輸恐受威脅　原棉廠辦更冷淡</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約美棉晨初開盤即堅、因一部份空頭抵補而漲、同業亦略有交易、日前議員施密斯所建議云、由政府每年由貸款棉項下提取一百五十萬包美棉、以補償願自動再减棉田者、唯此議雖遭大衆之反對、而政府却允再予考慮、定於下業期四答復說、昨日紐的近期漲二磅音、遠期跌二磅音、印度跌半羅比、埃及漲三五磅音、昨日匯兌頗覺疲乏、折合法幣、棉價反漲、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲五角、印棉漲七角、埃及棉張一元餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、甚爲靜寂、自海南島日軍登陸後、一般業紗布者、深恐海防運輸將受威脅、一部份棉紗團戶慮及紅盤價格、難有發展、各紗廠因之對購辦外棉更形冷淡、故於年內恐無巨額交易矣、茲將昨日棉價分錄於後、</p>
<p>本棉生意仍黯澹、僅同業購買點綴而已、廠方能度殊滯、期待紅盤開始、尙有發展舉動、市價亦無精彩可言、蘇北來源、益覺减色、計通州花到六百八十七包、北沙來一百十件、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>
<h3>糧食　盛傳某方在市　收買小麥</h3>
<p>最高竟達六元九　但此說難以證實</p>
<p>昨小麥市况、堅挺如故、査廠家交易、自洋麥定貨到滬以來、迄無熱烈之去化、而貨方執存者、亦大都擬待明年再售、所以堅執不鬆、又聞近日各粉廠雖無大宗去化、而閘北某粉廠仍在收買原料、故市面反爲堅佾、統市公開交易、竟無只包成交、而外傳某方收進之麥、最高價竟達六元九角之說、但此種傳設、恐難證實云、</p>
<h3>粉運津萬餘包　市面亦在結束中</h3>
<p>昨粉市仍鮮變化、惟大局已不若前兩日之堅穩、蓋緣舊歷年關迫近、買賣雙方、均乏盡興、南北兩帮客銷、零星去化雖尙不惡、迄無大量之成交、故市面已呈結束景象、全市成交、併計不足二萬包、除本街零批、的有七八千包外、粵閩冀魯各散帮、合辦僅一萬餘包、二號粉廠盤、仍爲四元八角、在目下各廠現粉軋缺之際、市面尙堪定立、</p>
<p>今日有麵粉一萬零五百包運天津、四千句運汕頭、七千包運福州、</p>
<h3>客秈午後轉活</h3>
<p>杜米頗多削價股售</p>
<p>客秈昨市與本尖同時趨跌、價小數分至角外不等、緣浮販散戶多主年展結束，晨間賣氣極旺、市面頗呈萎頓、價小而成交祇七八百包、然至午後因價小、引動店囤工廠去路、又開出二千多包、行情雖未克轉機、而市氣已不似上午之呆滯、昨自滸浦東一千包、</p>
<p>杜米市塲因十四日起結束、僅餘二天交易、形勢已呈衰落之象、各路來源旣稀、河下祇到五號、車輪包子一千餘包、而本街銷塲、已乏大胃、故售方手中貨夥者、惟謀急脫、頻頻讓價、頗形紊亂、結果各貨旣見再跌、而交易終屬有限、厚薄粳價貶洛幾分至一二角不一、至於杜洋尖埠尖、亦續降角許、獨變元以貨稀胃香、尙見站定、</p>
<h3>五金　白鉛皮頓易舊觀　電池廠進辦突濃</h3>
<p>岑寂已久之白鉛皮市面、昨日因電池廠在辦、市塲頓易舊觀、如五六號花色、全市存貨幾有被搜殆盡之勢、行情因之突升十餘元之多、五號最高每桶售二百二十元、六號沽二百零八元、但搜辦者依然衆多、惟新貨不繼、底存涸竭、來日不免有斷檔之憂、其他花色、則因電池廠進意較淡、客帮意存觀望、趨勢比較岑寂、但行情則亦被帶高一二元不等、如二號每桶售二百二十六元、三號每桶沽二百二十二元、四號售二百二十元、七號八號售三百元、丸號存貨較薄、故售價要二百三十五元、十號流通貨更爲稀薄、故開價在二百四十元以外、其他厚花色、因存貨更尠、故開價在二百五十元光景、査海外定價每噸要二十五鎊左右、按滙率計算、成本要二百五六十元之譜、同業多不敢購定云、</p>
<h3>油餅　臘鼓聲中　豆餅再開一批期貨</h3>
<p>昨共成交萬二千片　全爲泉州帮所辦去</p>
<p>豆餅因時感供不應求、是以榮多辱少、久居優越地位、昨日泉州帮在此歲暮之期、忽來問津期貨交易、故預測未來潛勢、依然堅挺耳、昨午後定開常州協豐廠四牌元隆餅七千片、訂三月份上半月交、價爲三元一角七分、至收盤時、溥利廠肥字四牌、亦訂開五千片、價爲三元一角九分、所以元隆餅在喊緊之下、未曾繼開、現餅成交一千片元隆餅、價因色次、祗開三元一角一分、亦爲泉州帮辦去、</p>
<p>生油昨有二千二百件自靑島來、今日則有二百五十件運福州、</p>
<p>雜糧方面、昨自靑島來花生二百五十件、今日出口、有豆子九百包、生仁四百包運汕頭、叉豆子四百五十包運福州、</p>
<h3>糖市　太古糖</h3>
<p>由厦完稅運申</p>
<p>昨糖市公會劃盤無甚上落、二四荷粗白外棧現貨二十四元一角半、本棧二十四元三角、轉口貨呌十六元二角、荷赤本棧貨十六元七角、轉口十一元、査聯營處存底尙有荷赤三萬二千包、太車赤H嘜一萬一千包、太古車白市亦平平、B嘜西棧貨二十四元、CW嘜二十三元九角、CX嘜二十三元八角、DY嘜二十三元七角、HX嘜二十三元六角、到貨有嘉應輪入口運來太車白二千九百五十包、太車赤H嘜十包、太車冰CC嘜一千包、據聞係由厦門轉口完稅、如是則前傳由厦完稅一節、業已實現、貨期太古糖前日開出即裝一萬一千包、價爲港幣九元二角半至八元八角八分半、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布疋靜待　新春應市</h3>
<p>出口貨尙不寂寞</p>
<p>國布因本客一致備辦結束手續、市塲上殊少勳靜、客帮僅有零星採辦、各貨廠盤均昂、同業手貨亦扳緊、白貨細布開價每疋微漲五分、色布平平、春銷漂布·府綢·蔴紗·洋紗等貨、各廠靜待明春應巾，此時呌盤均提高、頗不願遷就、川·滇·粵·閩帮接受定貨仍夥、儘於年內報裝、本街定貨交解依然熱鬧、新購辦數量甚寡、巳成尾聲、</p>
<p>東布交易漸靜、本街同業昨祇有零星小件額進出、大戶躉批墊銀轉棧者、大致就緒、惟白貨細布因囤戶仍在搜案·價續報漲、十好磅彩球市塲每疋喊高一角、售開十二元一角半、細斜比較平定、龍頭·陽鶴與前日行情、無甚軒輊、良以色斜售盤未升、染廠進意淸淡故也、洋行期貨龍頭細斜案價十二元、還價十一元八角不售、與現貨距離愈遠、未有成交、</p>
<p>今日有疋四百八十件運天津、一百十件運烟台、六十件運福州、六百八十件運汕頭、十件運香港、一百七十件運海防、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經洋荘交易</h3>
<p>多難接近</p>
<p>中外絲價、同吿堅定、昨紐的交易所開價、復上漲一二分、致本埠市氣更堅、廠方心思始終看好堅守、是以洋行交易多難接近、至於印莊銷路昨日轉呈寥落、良以土絲價格、巳漲至高境、復因連日大批吸購、胃納亦似相當滿足、故昨日交易巳稍遜色、共成交輯里經中上身十二件、售盤盤升五元以上、</p>
<h3>南北貨　高生晒肉漲三元許</h3>
<p>頂上生晒圓肉、前日曾到十數件、昨已見樣、身色俱佳、因置本甚昂、原價未肯放手、洽談之下旋即成盤、照前漲起三元許、但行盤售出較低、的差二元</p>
<h3>海味　潮金鈎售開十件</h3>
<p>潮汕碣石金鈎蝦尾、最近有一批昨爲潮帮某號開出十件、該貨色澤尙佳、惜間有身份稍軟者、扯盤每担爲八十三元（現鈔）、昨嘉應輪入口、由香港轉來海參一七二件、魚翅六件、</p>
<h3>來函　應徵小型磨粉機　答黃橋加力鎭宋君</h3>
<p>逕啟者、茲閱一月二十四日貴報、藉悉有黃橋宋君徵詢小型磨麵粉機器、向上海各洋行函詢、當然不能滿意、鄙人自歐洲考察回國後、常有各國小型粉機最合用者有英德二式、</p>
<p>英式有下列各機、　麥篩一、　刷麥機一、　立式石質圓盤磨一對、　絲絹粉篩二、用五馬力皮帶拖、每小時可做小麥三百斤、即出粉的二百斤、的價四五千元左右、可買全套、如須小號、則一馬力拖、每小時出粉四十磅、（無淸麥部份）價約一千二百元、</p>
<p>德式機如下、每小時做麥一市担即一百十磅、馬力的七匹、　麥篩一件、　淸麥機一件、　去灰機一件、小吸鐵一件、　雙軋床（石磨）一套、（石滾不發熱較鋼滾佳）、　絲絹平篩一對、連七尺方篩箱及鐵架一具、價國幣一千六百元至二千四百元、土磨做粉，麥潮粉濕、不能久擱、至多一月即霉、麩皮三五天即發酵生臭、此種機完全乾做、此優點一、大粉廠用絲絹平篩、故出粉細、九號絹篩做二號粉、此處相同、土法用籮筐篩眼、不及五六號、即六十眼、故出粉、麩粉不分、又因平石磨、麥不到處、石片相磨、砂子磨下混入粉中、上齒沙沙有聲、</p>
<p>新式無鍚一帶小型粉廠、不下百家、僅用電力發動平式石磨、加爾輪撥動、配以離公式鋼絲　圓　、均不可為訓、</p>
<p>要知小型廠無雙重磨、數重節、故出粉均不如大廠之能分二·三·四·五·四等粉及麩、中國大廠亦不出頭號麵、又無打麵機、故出粉不能及大廠之多也、大廠爲七二折、小廠的七折、初出之粉白、的五五折、後出之粉、（略）帶齒、然比目下之製法巳好去甚遠矣、</p>
<p>現欲問者、黃橋屬何省縣、（按黃橋加力鎭係屬江蘇如皋縣）宋君能出資本多少、願製粉幾袋、本地小麥價若干（以一百市斤論）、本地洋粉即大廠價若干何家出品、土粉價若干、麩皮出路有吾鄉人需要否、開支在麩不可小視、倘眞黃橋宋君有意、鄙人可代做預算設計、代辦包至出粉及代辦粉袋、從速定機、及裝好試機、有二個半月即可出粉、正趕時機也合意後冉談酬勞、出粉後鄙人即須他往、可敎會一人主持也、鄙人現正在宜興周鐵橋下邾街裝德式小型粉機、無錫來有小輪、朱定芝手上、法租界祁齊路二二六號德亞公司朱浩元先生轉、或蒲石路平安里十三號朱定芝、</p>

<h3>不怕慢只怕站</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>兩個星期的假期，悄悄地溜走了。現在又是一個新的學期的開始，小朋友們又要挾着書包上學，重新過着學校的生活了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們在學校裏求學，別因天資聰明而驕傲，把學業荒廢了：也別因天資愚笨而灰心。肯努力學習的，才是換最後勝利的。所謂「不怕慢，只怕站！就是這個意思。</p>
<p>「烏龜和兎子賽跑」的故事，是大家聽慣了的。烏龜爬得雖慢，但是它能够始終如一，繼續不斷的前進，所以是勝利了。兎子雖然跑得很快，但是它自以爲善跑，不肯努力，中途瞌睡，結果便失敗了。</p>
<p>這是給我們一個很好的敎訓：聰明的小朋友們，快以兎子自警，聰明是不可靠的，如果自恃聰明，不知努力，結果沒有不失敗的。愚笨的小朋友們，要以烏龜自勉，愚笨是不耍緊的，只要肯不斷地努力，結果未嘗不可以成功</p>
<p>歷史上儘有許多資質遲鈍的古人，因爲苦志力學，不畏難，不灰心，到底做出了一番驚人的事業。但是也不知有多少天才，不肯努力，站住半途，因此默默無聞。</p>
<p>可敬的小朋友們！牢記着：「不怕慢，只怕站！」努力你們的前程吧，不要停下前進的脚步，目的地在接近你們了！</p>
<h3>鐘和伽利略</h3>
<p>— 三弟</p>
<p>鐘—它吿訴我們什麼時候起身，告訴我們什麽時候上學，它也吿訴我們什麽時候睡覺，我們一天不能離開它，我們一刻不能不聽它的指揮，它對我們多少有用處呀？旣然對我們有這樣密切的用處，我們就不可不知道它是怎樣產生的和它爸爸一段有趣的故事。</p>
<p>伽利略是意國的一位科學家，生在西歷一五六四年，死在一六四二年，他一生給科學界上的供獻，多得不可數計。</p>
<p>有一天，他在比沙敎堂做禮拜，抬頭看見掛在壁上的一盞小燈，左右不住的搖盪不停，他因爲好奇的緣故，呆呆的瞧着，一直等到人家做了禮拜都回去，他依舊傻頭傻腦的站在壁下瞧個不停，並且不時用手按着他自己的脈搏，嘴裏一二三四念念有詞似的數個不停：主持的牧師以爲他發了在，要想攆他出去，可是他突然在笑起身，飛也似的跑回家去。</p>
<p>路上他嘻嘻哈哈的說：「有了，有了」，那牧師倒被他嚇了一大跳。</p>
<p>不多幾天，他做了一個器具並且發表了一篇文章，這個器具，就是現在一切鐘的鼻祖，這器具很簡單，完全和敎堂裏燈的原理一樣。他的文章裏說：「當我發現那鐘左右擺動一决，我的脈息跳兩决，我就决定擺動的時間是一定不變的，好了，我們以後有計算時間的工具了」。</p>
<p>當然伽利略的鐘，沒有小朋友們家裏掛在墻上和桌上的那樑準確和美麗，但是如果沒有他當時注意這盞小燈，那麼或許到現在我們還沒有計算時間的器具呢。</p>
<h3>怎樣說話</h3>
<p>— 婉</p>
<p>話是代表人的思想，耍認識一個從未見面的新朋友的性情，大都從說話中探聽，如說得滑稽突梯的，知道他是個有趣的人，說得消極而毫無生氣的，知道他是抱悲觀的，說得粗率的，知道他沒有受過敎育的，總之，人的品性和才幹，大都從說話中顯露。同時說話是對人的，因爲對人的緣故，有時說得人眉花眼笑，有時說得人目眦盡裂，有時說得人哭笑不得，說話眞是可以使人的面部變幻莫測。所以說話一方面是表示自己的性格，一方面，和他人要發生關係。小朋友不能不注意下列幾點：</p>
<p>一，不批評人—人不免有過失，而每人自己不見得沒有過失，可是人往往看不見自己的過失，只是論斷別人的過失，這種人氣量太狹，而自己過失是永不會悔改的。我希望小朋友，先要改過了自己的錯，然後不特背後批評人的態度，要有當着面規勸他的膽略。</p>
<p>二，誠實—有的小朋友，往往以哄騙爲喜，以至成爲不良習慣。留一個壊印象在人們的腦中，卽使是眞實的話，他人也不會相信的了。所以患有這種毛病的小朋友，請立刻改過自新吧。改過的方法，就是無論做得不對的事，非常坦白的吿訴師長或家長，當時不免受到刑罰，不過他們對你的話就改變了態度。</p>
<p>三，言行合一—就是說得到做得到，中國一般人的毛病，就是說得到，做不到，這種人無非。顧慮到事業的成敗，而沒决心，其實事業的成敗，在於做和不做的關鍵。</p>
<p>四，不搬弄是非—俗語卽是搬嘴舌，人和人的糾紛，大多由於第三者想討好一方面鬧出來的。在學校中也時常發生這種情形，希望小朋友們不要做這種沒有知識的行爲。如遇到同學間有意見，應從中調解使他們仍和好如常，這是你的責任。</p>
<h3>冰山的形狀是怎樣的？</h3>
<p>— 新生</p>
<p>小朋友，你的腦海中是不是常在推想的？</p>
<p>當你在氣候嚴寒，溫度低降或是大雪紛飛之際，看到戶外那些結冰的水面或是銀白色景物的時候，假若腦中是富於理想的話，那麼你一定會推想及那極地和寒帶地方的冰山了！而且生成種種想像的形狀。</p>
<p>冰山的形狀到底是怎樣的呢？現在讓我來講給小朋友們聽，這個或許可以補你們在敎科書所得到的知識之不足的。</p>
<p>普通在海洋上面飄浮的冰塊，由其　成原因的不同，可分爲海冰和陸冰兩大類，而冰山是屬於陸冰一類中的。冰山通常是和冰塊間雜了飄浮在天候極冷的海洋上的，它們的成因與海冰不同：北極圈內的格林蘭和司匹决培根等島嶼和南極洲大陸都是常年白雪皚皚之地，就因爲常年積雪，那些地方的積雪便愈壓愈堅，結果便變成冰塊，這冰塊當然有相當的重量，且其背後也有累積的冰塊；在上面的一經壓疊便生了壓力，向下排擠，下面的冰塊受擠壓後便沿了陸地的傾斜面徐徐從高處滑向海岸去，其速率每日大槪可以滑走數米至數十米不定。冰山浮達海岸時，因海水浮力的增大，或是受鉅大風浪之衝擊，整塊的冰層，往往被其切斷而分散地飄向海洋之上，這就是冰山的由來！</p>
<p>北極海面上的冰山都是從陸上生成的，形狀沒有一定，因共表面上附有砂土和岩石，所以現着深靑色的縞紋；它在水面上的長度自數米至數里，水面上的高度自二米至四百五十米不一，所以它在陸冰類中可說是很巨大的一種！</p>
<p>南極方面的冰山，並不像北極冰山那麽地都由山谷間流下的冰塊所凝結而成的；它們都是在廣漠的冰原上結成的，因此形狀很是平廣，一般的高度在五十米以下，但其闊度極廣一，二千米闊的冰山常長達三，四浬甚至五，六十俚，南極冰山最特異的一點就是它的頂面平而廣大，遠望去去好像冰塊凍成的堤防！</p>
<p>冰的比重是〇·九二，海水的比重是一·〇二七，所以照比重計算，冰山在水面以下的部份之深度應九倍於水面上部份之高度，但實際上水面下部份只有水面上部份六的·七倍；例如一座水面上百米高的冰山，它的水面下郁份大概祇有六·七百米深。</p>
<p>冰山在海洋上面隨風飄流，經日光之照射，波濤之冲毀，暖流之浸蝕，因此變成各種奇怪的形狀，有的很像橫列着的城堡，有的很像蹲伏地上的猛獸，有的却像屹立着的山峯，極爲奇觀！冰山經多日飄流，就逐漸溶解，水面上部份分別崩落，有時還發出一種巨大聲響；當冰山崩裂之時，若有船隻駛過其傍，那是很危險的事情！</p>
<p>冰山的景色雖是偉觀異常，可是許多的船隻，生物都因它而毀滅，喪生，即如英國的鐵大尼號大汽船，也是因和冰山相據而沉沒的。由是我們可以知道：冰山在是一樣雪白偉麗而又令人可怖的東西！</p>

<h3>過塘行中（上）</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>明兒避難記之十三</p>
<p>那時已在晚上八時多了，大街上的店誧都關上了門。明兒和他的哥哥聰兒合坐一輛人力車，一連有十多輛浩浩蕩蕩的向着江干趕去。明兒心中很奇怪，那些店爲什麽這樣早早的便不做營業了？他便這樣的向着他的聰哥。那知那車夫便回答道：「這幾天一天到晚的警報，有錢的人早已都跑掉了。昨日竟有十一决，害得我們不好做生意。你們今天眞運氣，一天到晚竟沒有一些警報。」明兒才知道杭州也不是理想中的天堂了。</p>
<p>費了足足有一小時之久，經過了不知多少的大街小巷，曲曲折折的，才到了江干的過塘行了，錢塘江面的燈火，倒映在如鏡面般的江上，煞是美麗。他們便忽忽的走了進去。</p>
<p>那過塘行是很寬大的，裏面堆積着不知多少的大包小箱的貨物。裏面的人很多，立的，坐的，老的，幼的，各色各樣的人，都聚集在一間屋子中。當明兒等走進去的時侯，大家彼此注目着，頓時寂靜下來，他們都是同明兒一樣命運的逃難人。後來便開始談話了，明兒靜靜的聽着。</p>
<p>「你們從那裏來？現在你們預備到那裏去呢？」那一個年紀輕輕的婦人，從黃而帶些愁容的面龐上，微微的現出一些笑容的問着明兒的母親。</p>
<p>「我們從烏鎭到杭州，費了三天，現在想到屯溪去。你們呢？」明兒的母親回答着。</p>
<p>「我們從嘉興來的，前天已到了杭州，船一隻也呌不到，在這裹住了一天多了，我們要到蘭谿去，船眞是難呌，出了好價錢也不容易呌到。」伊嘆了一口氣，更接着說道：「昨天眞是嚇死了人，來了二十多架銀灰色的飛機，在杭州城外丟了幾十個炸彈，而更有一個炸彈想炸錢塘江鐵橘，但這橋却沒有炸壊，反炸沉了鐵橋附近的十多艘小船，那炸聲使這裏的地都震動了，好不可怕。」那婦人講完了這話，談話的聲音是暫時的沉寂下來。</p>

<h3>偉大的鐵</h3>
<p>— 光霽小學五年級生　陸大治</p>
<p>在金·銀·銅·鐵·錫等金屬中，誰也想不到「鐵」在金屬中是最偉大的。</p>
<p>「鐵」最普通的用處，大家總知道的吧，製造各種的刀·鍋·鏟·剪·我們吃的飯，也　鐵才有呢！信嗎？我講給你們聽：飯是用米煮成的，煮米要用「鐵」鍋·對嗎，米呢？農夫種的，農夫種田要用鐵一鋤，「鐵」犂，鏟……這樣不是吃飯也靠「鐵」嗎？再說穿衣也靠「鐵，衣是布縫成的；縫布就耍用「鐵」針，不是衣服也靠「鐵」才有嗎？由此推想，房屋和道路都靠鐵」才成呢！</p>
<p>現在戰時所用的武器，全　鐵製成的。如槍·鐵甲軍·大刀·砲·飛機。</p>
<p>這樣看來，鐵比金銀銅錫……不是史偉大嗎？現在你們知道了鐵的偉大，就可以說，現在的世界是鐵的世界了。</p>

<h3>開學了</h3>
<p>— 震東小學六年級生　馬元鏞</p>
<p>短短的寒假、一　眼已經過去了，隔離了兩星期，現在又一裏又舉行開學典禮了，許多小朋友，隔離了兩星期，現在又可以朝夕聚在一起。我們眞是幸運，在這非常時期，還能受到適當的敎育，來堦養我們的身心。現在孤島上的敎育，已入了畸形狀態，家長費了許多血汗換來的金錢。給我們來讀書，我們應當要怎樣的淬勵奮發，使父母拿出來的金錢，不擲之虛牝；况且國家在此多難之秋，正亟須我們來復興中華民族，我們肩頭的責任正不輕，應常要培養好了基礎，那末才對得起我們的國家和我們的父母。</p>
<h3>早晨的雞聲</h3>
<p>— 民啟小學六年級生　李蘭珍</p>
<p>早晨我正在床上睡着；雞的聲音喔喔地呌起來，把我驚醒了，我起來推開窗一看，那美麗的太陽剛從地平綫升上去　接着我就洗了臉，吃了些早餐，便坐在沙發上讀幾頁書，讀了一會，就上學去，到了校裹，上課的時間還沒有到哩。</p>
<p>這時我的腦海裏，就想起這樣一個小小的雞，不但自己能早起，並且還能會把我們呌醒，多麽可敬啊！</p>
<p>可是它每天總是這樣有精神，我們靑年人做事要是不能振作精神去做，那麽就連雞都不如了。</p>
<h3>年糕</h3>
<p>— 前啟明小學六年級生　顧月英</p>
<p>時間快到廢曆的盡頭，近天來，街頭開始改變了個新的面目，祇要睜開眼，那新的點綴—年糕，準會使你甜到心裏。</p>
<p>可是今年的我，非但感不到往日的甜味。反而使我因之增加無限的惆悵！</p>
<p>記起吃年糕的事情，是够甜蜜的！每年寒假裏，我同哥哥回到我的故鄕；祖母在忙碌中總得抽閒來做年糕。那時我總站在伊的旁邊，快活地看着，常祖母把故鄕新米粉製成的年糕授給我，開始快慰地咀嚼時，那又香又甜的味兒，使我快活得忘記了一切。</p>
<p>現在呢？淪陷後故鄕的年糕，我再也吃不到了！就是那閘北的家和學校，亦都毀於砲火下。這是誰的賜與呢？我深深地記住，現在孤島的年糕我可不要吃，我要吃的是光復了故鄕以後的年糕。</p>
<h3>哥哥妹妹——捉麻雀</h3>

<h3>白雪公主（七）</h3>
<p>— 天孫</p>
<p>老頑固駡道：「你這樣像刮風般打着噴嚏，可是要把那鬼東西刮跑麼？」正在這富兒猛聽得樓上起了一個奇怪的聲響，直刺到他們的耳朶裏。原來白雪公主打了個呵欠，開始從睡夢中醒回來了。</p>
<p>博士抖顫着手，向樓上指點道：「在那邊，在那邊臥房中，那一定是不錯的。我以爲應該由那一個趕到樓上去，把它追趕下來才是。」</p>
<p>小啞吧的臉色頓時亮了一亮，他想這是一個很好的主意，照這樣幹是不錯的。當下他很熱心的的點着頭表示贊同的意思。但是他眼見得六個伙伴全把眼睛定注在他的臉上時，便不再點頭了。</p>
<p>可憐小啞吧！他瞧了這情形，心裹已很明白，他們六人已推定他去幹這件事了。他本是個非常膽怯的人，幾乎嚇得他整個的身體都成粉碎。他本想設法推辭讓別的人去幹，但那博士早就將一枝蠟燭硬塞在他那抖顫的手中，使他再也沒有推辭的機會。他無可奈何，只索硬着頭皮戰戰兢兢的爬上了樓梯，向那黑魃魃的臥房溜去，他的滿口牙齒都在捉對兒厮打。</p>
<p>他放膽推開了房門，探進頭去張望，不道這時白雪公主恰好伸開兩條臂來，把白色的被單掀得高高的，瞧過去活像是一個鬼怪，正要趕下來撲人的樣子，小啞吧一瞧之下，眞嚇得魂飛魄散，使盡了他兩條小腿的速力，沒命的奔下樓梯去，用了種種的手勢，（因爲他是啞吧，從來不會開口說話的緣故。）報吿他的六個伙伴，說那鬼怪正躺在他們的牀上睡覺。他們得了這報吿，再也不敢怠慢，便合夥兒的鼓起與氣來，將鋤頭掮在肩頭，點起了脚尖溜上摟去。</p>
<p>博士向他的伙伴們低聲說道：「你們全都準備好，等我揭去被單時，就把鋤頭劈下去劈死它！」</p>
<p>六個矮人連忙擎起了鋤頭等候着。博士走上前去，很快的伸出一隻手揭去了被單。</p>
<p>不知怎樣，一霎時間，他們都同聲驚呼起來。七個鋤頭都不知不覺放了下去，七對眼睛都不知不覺瞪得圓圓的，越瞪越圓，七張嘴也不知不覺的張開了，越張越大。這七個矮人活了幾百年，從來沒有瞧見過這樣美的美人！</p>
<p>貪睡囁囁嚅嚅地問道：「博士，這——這是甚麽一回事？」</p>
<p>噴嚏吐了口氣道：「這眞美麗　了」</p>
<p>怕羞，也放低了聲音，嘖嘖地讚美道：「這般的美麗——眞好像是天　　仙子</p>
<p>老頑固把鼻子吸着氣道：「哼！在我瞧來，這定是煩惱的很　　我是絕對不贊成的。</p>
<p>快樂追問道：「博士，這到底是甚麽啊」？</p>
<p>博士像口吃般訥訥地答道：「什麼，什麼，我想這是一個女孩子。是的，一些兒不錯，這是一個女孩子」</p>
<p>矮人們都好奇似的問道：「這是一個女孩子麼？呌我們怎麼辦？你　，它已佔了我們的三個　鋪了。」</p>
<p>老頭　不高興的咕噥着道：「現其是女孩子，還是一個　　倒好」！博士忙道：「這是那裏來的話！伊不會傷害我們的！」</p>
<p>「噓，不要作聲！伊巳醒回來了」！</p>
<p>前二期本篇中「鐵劃」與「鐵鐘」字樣，應一律改爲「鋤頭」。</p>

<h3>報銷主義</h3>
<p>— 力士</p>
<p>報銷主義在過去的中國是很風行的。</p>
<p>學生祇要識字，便可對學校當局報銷，學校當局也便可對學生家長報銷。至於讀書所以明理，學校當局和學生家屬是可以不聞不問的。</p>
<p>經理祇要有紅賬，便可對董事會報銷，董事會也便可對股東會報銷。至於營業的實况如何，盈的是吾有呆賬，虧的是吾無情賬，董事會和股東會是可以不聞不問的。</p>
<p>政治工作者祇要有工作報告，便可對上司報銷，上司便可對政府報銷。至於工作報告的是否實在，工作進程的是否確當。上司和政府是懶得去顧問的。</p>
<p>爲了這，一切的學術，一切的事業，和一切的政治，都呆滯着不能向前進展。</p>
<p>不過話得說回來，報銷主義者也有它的不得已的苦衷。學生爲敷衍家長的栽培，纔以識字作報銷，經理爲逃免股東的責難，纔以不實在的紅賬作報銷；政治工作者爲要祛除他人的抨擊，纔以冠冕堂皇的工作報告作報銷；所以報銷主義雖然阻碍了中國的一切進展，却也挽救了一切卑劣心理者的命運。</p>
<p>東鄰友邦是怪聰明的，它一部維新史，便是吸收世界文明的記載，而今因爲侵略中國的結果，遭遇了奇難，也採用報銷主義起來。</p>
<p>東鄰友邦用兵十九個月的結果，是犧牲兵員七十萬，損失國庫八十萬萬；現在更覺兵員補充的困難經濟萬分的窘迫，和國際形勢的孤立；因此國內反戰空氣的日濃一日，厭戰自殺的也日多一日，整個日本國內的民衆，對現象多深表不滿。日本軍部在侵華戰事旣無法開展，政治陰謀又宜告坍台的時候，便不得不侵佔海南島，以便向他們國內民衆好作一個報銷。你看：東京方面，在大吹大擂，說佔領中國沒有海防的海南島，是個「奇襲」，豈非在欺騙國內民衆，藉資報銷？</p>
<p>報銷主義在抗戰中長成起來的新中國，快將死減了，但在沒落和崩潰中的日本，却正有它滋長的機會！</p>
<h3>劇壇外史</h3>
<p>— 瞿史公</p>
<p>魯思，蓬鬆的頭髮，和粗濃的鬍鬚，這便是他的標幟。</p>
<p>他生平最怕的是理髮，他說理髮店是西式的拘留所，一跑進去便將喪失一小時的自由——行動的自由。</p>
<p>頭髮長了，鬍鬚長了，管它，他說這樣才合乎「自然美。」</p>
<p>長得不能再長的時侯，他常被他的朋友M押進理髮所去。——眞的，沒有一决是他自動要去剪髮的。</p>
<p>因爲他的頭髮和鬍鬚的濃長，曾經鬧過很多笑話。大的是七八年前，那時他還在復旦唸書，女同學們見了他，總愛議論他的年齡，大家猜他至少是四十歲以上的人了。其實，他現在還沒有滿三十哩。</p>
<p>少說閒話，且來談談他底「十二窘事」中的二三件罷。</p>
<p>四五年前的一天晚上，魯思在民報編輯室裏，突然來了一個不速之客，他一跑進門，便氣憤憤地說：「你借去用的電風扇，究竟還想還嗎？」</p>
<p>「什麼電風扇？我沒有借過。」魯思答他。</p>
<p>「您是不是力　　（魯史）先生？</p>
<p>「是的，我呌力　　（魯思；）可是我沒有向誰借過風扇。」</p>
<p>「不，你借過，去年夏天。」</p>
<p>「你認識那個姓力　　嗎？」</p>
<p>「不認識。他託一個姓周的向我借的，說是你拍影戲——「淚痕」用的。」</p>
<p>這時，魯思才噓口氣，知道他找錯了人：那是魯史，姓侯的。</p>
<p>一九三三年夏，「時代劇社」參加持志大學的遊藝會演「六二三，」邊裏扮演母親的是尤競，飾他女兒的呌張劍芬。大家都已化裝好，快要上台開幕的剎那間，那位姓張的小姐忽然解去了包頭布，對魯思——「六二三」是他導演的——說：「我不高興演了！你看我的臉給他們化裝得多黑，太難堪了！」</p>
<p>魯思的口材，誰都知道是很糟的，這時，他窘得簡直連半句話都說不上來。後來，虧了允競的勸導，才解了魯思的窘。</p>
<p>也有四五年了，一夫早上，他和凌鶴看完了「試片，」從金城大戲院出來。凌鶴對他說：「今天我請你吃和菜去，」於是兩個人走上了四馬路一家酒店去，砌了一斤老酒，興高地對酌着。吃完了飯，算賬的時候，凌鶴才發覺自己忘了帶錢；這時，魯思的口袋裏却僅有二毛錢，當然又是一窘。</p>

<h3>離垢先生之貓</h3>

<p>先生住上海縣華涇之黃葉樓，樓居鎭之東北，宅式極古，爲明代所建，四圍高墻，均植薛荔，庭中種慈孝竹，春夏之交，綠樹濃蔭，曲廊廻繞，頗幽靜古緻。樓中藏書甚富，先生在野時，恒居此作書硏究學術，愛　成癖，難斷簡殘篇，　不珍藏。民元夏　，二十四史，忽被鼠子嚙去遼史數頁，痛恨不已，乃畜一狸貓，色斑爛似虎，先生甚愛之，每食跽居桌邊，與之食則食，不與亦弗攫也，自是鼠患遂絕。翌年生二雛，將　逾常貓，其雛尚未能食飯，母貓忽病，不　日而死，先生竟痛哭失聲，瘁之後　，時姚鵷雛先生有輓貓詩二首，中有「空費晨餐二寸魚」之句。其後　家人善飼二雛，雛貓稍長，亦依戀主人，不離左右，故文字之暇，輒以貓爲消遣品也。及先生遠游京師，掌敎北京大學，家報中亦時詢其愛貓，是貓　之五代，頃尚留其一。去秋避難到申，未曾携帶，先生亦時念之，今者已矣，先生以憂國而亡，不知斯貓向能憶其王人否乎。</p>

<h3>彈性豔侶</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>“Too　Heot　to　Hcandle”</p>
<p>米高美公司出品　南京大戲院映</p>
<p>看完了「彈性豔侶」，最慼到遺憾的，是劇本編製的失敗。「美國各新聞影片公司咸派專員，攝取世界重要新聞，鈞心鬥角，均以獲得獨秘之新聞爲榮」是事實：而攝影員的赴湯蹈火，出生入死，去攝製新聞片，也是事實，採取這樣眞切的題材來編製劇本，是祇要抓住某一個動機，從上述的二點——也就是所謂主題，發展下去，如彈性豔侶一的前半部戲那樣，無論用喜劇或悲劇的形式來表現，都能非常動人的；但在「蓋皮獲得亨特在上海攝得之影片，特於招待會中放映，前事暴露，愛兒瑪之聲譽頓受打擊」以後，本片的劇作者或許是求勝過切，在後半部戲中，突然又另起爐灶，從橫刺里放了開去，雖然他安挿了許多驚險塲面，但是這攔腰被截的寫法是破壞了整個戲的統一，也破壞了全劇的情感的。</p>
<p>本片的導演者賈克可威（Jack　Conway）是一個導演喜劇的能手，片的開始，各公司競攝新聞片：比爾設計；愛兒瑪乘飛機來上海；亨特冒險搶救：他用簡短的膠片，最快的調子，而又步步進逼，介紹本片兩個最重要的人物出塲，那是非常可愛的。在後半部戲中，因爲劇本的限制，他祇是儘可能地在片斷上用力了。</p>
<p>如愛兒瑪和亨特抵平　小鎭後，因看見一土人戴有哈亭（愛兒瑪之兄）的手錶，亨特和他助手到巫毒村去尋訪哈亭的時候，亨特欲殺土人而被他遁去；巫毒村的祭禮；——特等放映新聞片嚇退土人；亨特抱了哈事欲走，河邊的船却已失踪這一節，導演者用土人的狂歡，音樂，來陪　亨特和他助手的情緒，及放映新聞片時和土人驚駭底剪接的緊凑，都顯示了賈克可威導演手腕的精湛了。</p>
<p>還値得提出的是本片的攝影。愛兒瑪駕使飛機，亨特在機上攝取海船爆炸的情形，雖然有幾個近景都看得出飛被和海船的模型，但那幾個中景的攝取，及愛見瑪救了哈亭乘飛機離開巫毒村時。亨特拉着飛機不放，比爾鳴槍，鏡頭放在飛機右側，看着亭特放手後的小船在浪花中直瀉下去，這不免使人感到中國攝影塲的物質條件的缺乏。</p>
<p>片中還有段寫到上海的戰事，據朋友告訴我，裏面有飛機轟炸及亨特的遇險等塲面，但銀幕上在飛機列隊飛過後，就接上亨特　取假飛機的鏡頭，這大概是犧牲在「此時此地」的剪刀下了。但從這裏也可以看出劇作者是在儘量抓取素材，把「彈性豔侶一寫成一個「炒什錦」的故事了。</p>
<p>克拉克蓋博兩的亨特，茂娜洛埃的愛兒瑪都努力，飾蓋皮的華德康那萊也成功。</p>

<p>目說何家兩位小姐，坐了旅館裹的送客汽傘，來到北火車站。車票是旅舘裏早買好的了，用不着再到火車站上去買。兩位小姐的行李，非常簡便，每人一隻小提箱，其中無非幾件隨身衣服而已。她們本來是乘了飛機來到上海的，飛機上當然不能多帶行李。就是那隻手提箱，也是以輕質的材料製成，專供飛機上用的。火車是九點鐘開，她們八點叫—五分到了車站，看見乘車的人非常之多。雙玉便向儷玉道：『你瞧這許多乘火車的人，昨天的的吳君素，恐怕是找不到她了。』儷玉道『找不到她，也沒有辦法，反正到了蘇州，沒有她招呼，我們也能自己料理的。』誰知她們剛剛走到月台上，只聽得遠遠地有個人喊道。『何家姊姊！你們怎麼到這時候纔來呀！』一瞧正是吳君素。原來吳君素比她們先來，她到車廂裏一看，並不見何家姊妹。她知道她們一定還沒有來，所以站在月台上等候她們。今見她們遠遠地來了，便急忙招呼。現在火車上的制度，却與戰前大大　有些不同了。第一，戰前的火車，分了無數的等級。有頭等車，有二等車，有三等東，那倒不去管它。而三等車之下，還有四等車，名之曰：貧民小工中。創行邪四等車的人，或是出於好意，以爲坐叫等車的人，價錢要便宜得多。雖然設備和待遇是差一點，快慢也還是一樣。但是因爲有幾等車，好像把人類也顯然的分出幾等來了。有了四等車，好像有了第四等人，誰是合該做第四等人呢？要加惠於一般人民，不可以把車資普通减低嗎？常時頭等車算是最高階級的了，然而頭等車之上，還有掛着花車的。甚而至於有什麼政府要人，國家大老，特地的開了專車的。現在開專車是沒有的了，縱有要人要事，他們不會坐飛機嗎？花車那種貴族式的火車也很少，除非是招待外賓，由政府出資，包一節呈。譬如各國大使，到國府來，覲見主席，呈遞國書的時候，帶了許多參贊秘書等，那必須由國民外交委員會給他們包一節車。這也不稱之爲花車，只是迎賓的包車罷了。（三七）</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>淪陷中的蘇州游藝界</h3>
<p>— 韋修</p>
<p>崑劇　蘇州自經淪陷之後，娛樂事業，首先呈著種畸形的發展。開頭是仙霓社的崑劇，借玄妙觀裕才小學校址做劇塲，票價分一毛五分二種，掛的都是連臺正本好戲，唱作認眞，續演至三個月之久。蘇州懂崑劇的人很多，能哼這麽幾句的也不少，所以營業著實不壞。後來因應上海東方書塲之聘，纔收塲停唱。</p>
<p>平劇　平劇有開明，東吳，金城三戲院。開明在城內北局，各種機關佈景，在戰事中一點沒有損壞，所以開鑼最早。東吳在閶門橫馬路，大門和后臺的一部被燬，現略加修葺後開幕。金城在閶門石路，賃平屋數大間勉强支搭開演。開明，金城，各演西遊記，東吳演紅蓮寺，互以機關佈景競賽，東吳並用「少女歌舞團」號召。票價不出一毛二毛範圍，營業開明最好，東吳次之，金城較差，但大致都能維持，不致虧本。</p>
<p>電影　電影院有蘇州，大光明，青年會三家，片子須經僞吳縣敎育局同蘇州特務班的檢查，領到許可證後，方得開映。片子據說只要沒有危險性（？）都可以領到許可證，像雷雨日出等片子，都映過；貂蟬，潘金蓮等古裝片子，當尤受歡迎。至於蘇州大戲院，仍一貫的放映「外國片子」。</p>
<p>灘簧　蘇州雜耍方面，像戲法，宣卷，堂名，南詞等，向有「延慶」「開智」二個社團，營業範圍，專做喜慶的堂會。平時因蘇州綦衆，每逢「畫堂，應接不暇，所盡力緊縮，堂會乃至絕無僅有，營業一落千丈，遂不得不改變方針，另謀出路，紛紛搭班組織灘簧塲子，冀圖維持。同時街頭賣唱者流，亦都有雜湊搭班，開塲演唱的。所以現在蘇州的灘簧塲子特多，流品也極複雜，什麽地方的灘簧都有，像蘇灘，本灘，錫灘，常熟，常州灘簧等等，幾於指不勝屈。規模略大，腳色行頭，佈景比較齊整一點的，有道和，國泰，福安，大新，新東方等五六家，此外大都因陋就簡，無足稱述。</p>
<p>書場　蘇州最普遍的娛樂塲合，無疑是書塲了。每位不過四分錢，書茶一起在裏面，眞可說得上是平民化了。全城有六十多副塲子，但是能賣到「上百」的，竟不多見；原因是「響噹」先生，都不在本地，號召力量不大，所以營業難有起色，但轉瞬廢曆年關，蘇州「會書」上市，那時羣雄畢集，自有一番熱鬧的景象哩。</p>
<h3>談賡春曲社之陣容</h3>
<p>— 長公</p>
<p>賡春之成立，距今將四十年，爲海上曲界最老之集團，人材頗盛，下星期一將在卡爾登出演，籌募難民經費。諸君子既有此義舉，余與此中人士，多半相識，紹介之責，所不敢辭。談崑戲者，無不知徐君凌雲，十餘歲即登塲，以付角（即二面）爲正工，而老生巾生雉尾生丑凈老旦，亦無不兼擅，造詣之深不懷爲全能者。其於凈角戲，　年僅得見「劉唐」一劇，名家搬弄，確是不凡：「嫁妹」　近始演之，此劇身段，本已繁重，凌雲又特別加多，更見花團錦簇矣。凌雲有丈夫子三，皆精崑劇，韶九君之冠生，尤見重於時，其氣度之壅容華貴，表演之落落大方，益以瀏亮之嗓音，宛轉之唱法，故其王　戲，（崑劇本無此名詞，今借用之），當菴罕與頡頏者。此番串演「驚變」，勝任愉快，自不待言，愛好崑曲者，當盤節聽之。</p>
<p>生旦戲之宜細膩熨貼，無人知之，然能做到此四字，實不多　，尤須生旦錄鋼悉稱，方爲全壁，殷震賢君之生，葉小泓君之旦，爲曲界推崇久矣。兩君合作之劇，如「喬醋」「藏舟」「偷詩」「梳妝」「跪池」等，見者莫不譽爲變絕。而「斷橋」一劇，兩君合作次數尤多，洵屬不朽之作，非尋常歌塲中所得見也，趙君星叔有麗人之目，能戲亦多，並皆精妙，而於「佳期」尤有精深之研究，余賞謂此劇是貼日戲之精銳，所有身段，集中於是非拙筆所能描寫，當欣賞於星叔之搬演</p>
<p>崑劇老生，分生外末三種，余識賡春唱老生者三人，均爲曲界知名之士，予之私意，徐君烈丞端重瀏亮宜於生，陳君實謙充滿逾勁宜於外；管君際安淵博精細，宜於末，烈丞之「雲陽法塲」，素負盛名，精神飽滿，臺步穩鍊，自始至終，絲毫不茍，端是傑作，實謙此番退而爲輔，未免避重就輕，際安忽串「照鏡」，不知其葫蘆裏賣什麽藥也。</p>

<p>不過後來喜瑞因牧人頗堅，遂爾嗜好日深，自己又愛逛逛玥子，挑選個人兒，以致弄得嗓音大不如前。郝壽臣全家都是基督敎徒，煙酒等嗜好一點不沾，故而嗓音日有時境。恰巧在某處的堂前裏，一個搗亂鬼專點他二人合演的「眞假李逵，」本來郝侯二人也並無多大的仇恨，不過　下一般看客裏，兩黨的忠實份子都有，各捧各的角，各喊各的好，就在這兩點上竟然引起一塲風波來了。適巧那天喜瑞的嗓子沒在家，當然唱唸時比較壽臣略差；因此捧郝的人就格外得意起來，同時神氣十足，自命是喜瑞被壽臣給啃扒下啦；而在臺上的兩人，也是一個洋洋得意，一個垂頭喪氣。這樣一來，兩人的仇可大啦。等到後來眞假李逵對打一塲，侯喜瑞可把他的看家本領拿出來啦。喜瑞是科班的底子，且不去說他，論起身個來，他先比壽臣搜長一些，固轉起來也比胖而矮的壽臣　便許多。壽臣本來武工稍弱，再加以靴底太高，身體臃腫，舞動雙斧時，怎能及得上喜瑞的敏捷靈活，上下翻飛，起先還能支技兩下，後來簡直無力還手，直往後退，險些被他擠到臺口，栽了下去。這時喜瑞的面子固是贖了過來，得意之極，而同時臺下捧他的人也覺得精神百倍，大可揚眉吐氣了。上面所述這三椿吃戲醋的事，都遠隔一二十年啦，在當時看了，難說是大爲振奮，但是事後想起，總覺得這是野蠻沒有戲德的舉動。況且訓練出一個名角，也是很不容易的事情，萬一爲吃戲醋，傷了那裏，成爲殘廢，這確實是件不道德而很可惋惜的事呢。</p>

        <h1>1939.02.12</h1>
<h3>President Chiang Discusses Attacking Hainan Island Regarding Japan</h3>
<p>Striving to Intervene to Prevent Easy Occupation.</p>
<p>Victory or Defeat in the War of Resistance Depends on Mainland Warfare. The Gain or Loss of One Island is Fundamentally Unimportant.</p>
<p>Britain and France Have Jointly Proposed Demands to Japan.</p>
<p>(Chongqing) President Chiang, on the morning of the 11th, responded to inquiries from foreign journalists and expressed his views on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island as follows: Question: What is the real intention behind Japan's recent advance into Hainan Island? Answer: Regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, we can recognize its significance and major impact by observing the entire situation of the Far Eastern seas. Hainan Island is a major strategic center in East Asia, between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. If the Japanese army occupies the island, it can not only completely block transportation between Hong Kong and Singapore and cut off the connection between Singapore and Australia but also put the Philippines under its control. This not only directly threatens French Indochina but is also the beginning of complete control over naval power in the Pacific. If the island falls into the hands of the Japanese army, the Japanese navy can look toward the Mediterranean Sea from the Indian Ocean in the west, and in the east, it can cut off the connection between the British and American naval bases of Singapore, Hawaii, and Pearl Harbor. Therefore, this move by the Japanese army is clearly a response to the American fleet's visit to Singapore last year. Question: Why is this move by Japan the beginning of controlling naval power in the Pacific? Answer: We all know that Japan has three most important strategic strongholds in the Pacific: Sakhalin Island in the north, Hainan Island in the west, and Guam in the east. If Japan wants to gain complete control of the sea, it cannot forget these three places. If all three fall into Japan's hands, then the Philippines and Hawaii will be equivalent to being occupied by Japan. Currently, Japan has already occupied half of Sakhalin Island, and now it is attempting to occupy Hainan Island to block the British navy from connecting eastward with the United States. If this plan is not obstructed, Japan will further seek to control Guam. This will not only prevent the American navy from moving westward but also cut off its connection with the Philippines. To carry out its southward policy and dominate the Pacific, Japan has been meticulously planning to create a connecting line between these three major strongholds for thirty years. When Japan created the so-called North Sea Incident in the 25th year of the Republic (1936), its intention was to use it as an excuse to advance into Hainan Island. However, due to fear of various countries, it did not dare to launch it. Now, it is resolutely disregarding everything and openly invading Hainan Island. If it is not intending to provoke a world war, it is one of the last and riskiest moves in its military aggression against China. After hesitating for decades, it has now resolutely implemented it. This is not only the first and largest event since the start of the Sino-Japanese War but also the only key to changing the Pacific situation in thirty years. Now that Japan has revealed its ambitions, any country with deep ties to the Far East cannot allow this dangerous attempt to run rampant. It is important to know that in Japan's entire naval strategy, Hainan Island is the second gateway for Japan in the western Pacific, and Guam is the second gateway for Japan in the eastern Pacific. Question: Then where is Japan's first gateway, the most forward one, in the east? President Chiang smiled and replied, "This is already well known to people in Europe and America, and Americans must know it even better. There is no need to elaborate." Question: To what extent will Japan's occupation of Hainan Island affect peace in the Far East? Answer: To answer this question, it must be known that Japan's advance into Hainan Island on February 10th of this year (1939) is equivalent to the occupation of Shenyang on September 18th (1931). In other words, Japan's attack on Hainan Island is tantamount to creating a "September 18th Incident" in the Pacific. The land may have differences between land and sea, but the impact is completely the same. Recalling the Shenyang Incident, except for the then US Secretary of State Stimson, the authorities of other countries did not pay attention to it. Japan was able to continue to expand its aggression, and now, eight years later, it has created a situation of brazenly dominating East Asia and increasing its arrogance to conquer the world. Now Japan is attacking Hainan Island again. If it is allowed to occupy and entrenched itself, I expect that its designed naval and air force base will be initially completed in less than eight months. Then the situation in the Pacific will suddenly change drastically. Even if France wants to set up a naval base in Indochina and the United States wants to fortify Guam, there will be no time to wait. Therefore, Japan's resolute southward advance is not to end the Sino-Japanese war but proves that it is willing to take the last risk to create the beginning of a Pacific war. Question: What arrangements does China have for Hainan Island? Answer: Because China has no navy, it cannot defend the coastline. However, it has long prepared all land-based arrangements and will do its best to fight the enemy on the island and will never allow them to easily occupy it. As for the Japanese army's invasion of Beihai, we have made thorough arrangements and preparations and will give them a strong blow. Moreover, this move has no meaning in the enemy's invasion of China itself and will only put them in a more unfavorable position, which is understood by general military observers. Question: What impact does the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island have on the Sino-Japanese war? Answer: The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island does not have a significant impact on our country's war of resistance because the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese war must depend on military actions on the mainland. The occupation of one island has fundamentally nothing to do with us. (11th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Responsible sources here recently stated that regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, the British and French governments have instructed their ambassadors to Japan to make representations to the Japanese government, demanding an explanation of the reasons, nature, and duration of the occupation. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hong Kong received a radio report this morning that the French fleet had arrived in Haikou from Guangzhou Bay, with the number of ships unknown. It was also learned that Singapore Governor Tomes and his wife had arrived in Saigon and are scheduled to meet the Vietnamese Governor in Hue on the 11th to discuss Hainan Island and Far Eastern issues. The Vietnamese French authorities are extremely stimulated by the Japanese army's landing in Hainan and are investigating the situation in that area and are temporarily refusing to express their views. (Special dispatch at 10 PM on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign dispatch: After the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, the French warships in Guangzhou Bay were ordered to sail to Hainan and have now arrived at the Haikou sea area, but the number of ships is unknown. (Dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a radio report received here, the French fleet originally stationed in Guangzhou Bay has suddenly arrived at the entrance of Haikou at the northern end of Hainan Island. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The report that French warships are currently near Hainan Island has been confirmed by the French Foreign Ministry this afternoon. It is said that the warships near Hainan Island intend to investigate the current situation of the island on the spot, to what extent the Japanese army has actually implemented the occupation. France has no intention of demonstrating strength. As for the activities of French warships in Guangzhou Bay and Tokyo Bay, there is nothing unusual about them. French political figures believe that France's naval strength in the Far East is not strong and may not take heavy actions. Britain and France are consulting on the incident of Japan occupying Hainan Island, and they will raise a joint protest. The content has not yet been released. (Everyday News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China, responsible sources here recently stated that the French government has instructed its ambassador to Japan, Henri, to request the Japanese government to explain the reasons, nature, and duration of the occupation. The British government has also decided to make the same representations. British Ambassador Sir Phipps consulted with French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday, and the two governments will continue to maintain close contact. Responsible sources here also said that the Japanese army's move is due to two reasons: First, it may be afraid that foreign arms will be transported to China via French Vietnam. Regarding this, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the French government has taken a proper attitude, even going beyond the scope of treaty obligations, and has repeatedly provided guarantees to the Japanese government. Second, it may be because the Japanese government intends to send Masanosuke Tani as its ambassador to France, but the French government has not agreed. In fact, France has long stated that it has no dissatisfaction with Tani personally and even greatly respects him. What the French government expects is that Tani's remarks regarding the Chinese government's purchase of arms via Vietnam should be corrected, which is also a proper move, it is said. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China, French Ambassador Corbin visited Sir Cadogan of the Foreign Office this morning to discuss the issue of British and French ambassadors jointly making representations to the Japanese government. As generally known, if the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is of a long-term nature, then Britain and France should consider various means of self-defense, even retaliatory means, to deal with it. British political figures also said that after the Japanese army occupies the island, the threat to Britain is the same as that to France. Britain and France are completely aligned. This was clearly stated by Prime Minister Chamberlain in his speech in the House of Commons on the 6th of this month. Now that the Hainan Island issue has arisen, the two countries have encountered an opportunity to practically demonstrate their alliance, it is said. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Haikou, Qiongzhou Transfer Positions</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou Bay) The Japanese army landing on Hainan Island numbers about 5,000 to 6,000, advancing toward Haikou, Qiongzhou. Fierce fighting occurred. The Chinese defense forces had no choice but to transfer their positions due to the disparity in numbers. Fierce fighting is still taking place near Haikou and other places. According to a dispatch from Macau, Japanese warships have arrived in Haikou and landed troops. Haikou, Qiongzhou is in great fire, and residents are fleeing to the Leizhou Peninsula. The situation is also becoming tense. Transportation between Hainan Island and Macau has been cut off. (Special dispatch at 10 PM on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The fighting north of Qiongshan is fierce. Chinese troops are fighting hard. Large reinforcements of the Japanese army continue to land, circumventing the flanks of Qiongshan. Japanese commander Kondo, commander of the 3rd Destroyer Division, has arrived in Haikou. (Special dispatch at 9 PM on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received here, the troops stationed on Hainan Island under the command of General Zhang Da were transferred to the mainland of Guangdong Province to participate in the war when the Japanese army landed in Daya Bay. Therefore, the Chinese army offered less resistance when the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island. However, guerrillas are scattered throughout the island and will inevitably engage in a long-term struggle with the Japanese army. Last night, the Japanese army engaged in fierce fighting with the guerrillas. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Occupation of Hainan Proves Its Will is Completely Chaotic</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chinese figures here do not express surprise at the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, believing that it is a further step in Japan's anti-British and anti-French stance. Hainan Island is of little importance to China's national defense, but its threat to the sea and air transportation between Vietnam, the Philippines, and even Hong Kong and Singapore is extremely serious. Chinese newspapers here generally believe that the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is a violation of the French-Japanese treaty. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese newspapers here continue to comment on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, all saying that this move proves that the Japanese army can no longer advance into the interior of China. The Central Daily News said that the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island shows that the Japanese army is now encountering strong resistance from the Chinese army in the interior. The Japanese government is worried about economic retaliation from Britain and the United States and is troubled by various problems and criticism from public opinion, resulting in its will being completely chaotic today and unable to decide its future policy. From the perspective of the Japanese army fighting in the interior, occupying Hainan has no military value. However, Japan's current position makes it difficult to confront the naval positions of Britain, France, and the United States in the South Pacific. It is obvious that the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island is only intended to reverse the various difficulties it is currently encountering in China in the eyes of the domestic and international community. The Xinhua Daily believes that the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is enough to threaten the position of Vietnam, Singapore, and the Philippines. The three countries of France, Britain, and the United States may not tolerate this move. However, China must not rely on foreign developments to cope with the overall situation but should strengthen the defense of South China to stop the Japanese army from invading the southwest and constantly strive to maintain transportation in the southwestern provinces. The Sao Dang newspaper said that Hainan Island was incorporated into Chinese territory in the Han Dynasty and has been so for more than 1,600 years. The National Government had planned to develop the island, but due to the war of resistance against Japan, it could not be realized. The Japanese army's occupation of the island is not only an invasion of Chinese territory but also directly endangers the position of France and Britain in the Pacific. The Ta Kung Pao said that Hainan Island is indeed an important naval base, but China has no navy, so the Japanese army's occupation is irrelevant to the future of China's war of resistance. However, will France still remain silent about it? Japan has repeatedly guaranteed not to harm the interests of third parties. Where is its guarantee? (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<h3>Foreign Media Severely Criticizes Japanese Army's Landing on Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Reasons for Occupation Untenable, Treaty Obligations Already Violated</p>
<p>(Paris) The media here unanimously condemned the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China in strong terms, saying that Japan had violated its obligations and exerted pressure on French Vietnam. The right-wing L'Écho de Paris stated, "The reasons cited by the Japanese government are absolutely untenable. The French government will definitely lodge a very strong protest, and other countries will certainly take similar action. The end of the war between China and Japan is still far away. We are far from the battlefield and have plenty of time to respond." The right-wing Le Matin also said that the French government will definitely lodge a protest. The right-wing Le Figaro stated, "The British and French governments, after exchanging views, have decided to lodge a protest with the Japanese government. As early as June 27th of last year, British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler stated in the House of Commons that the British and French governments had instructed their ambassadors to Japan to clearly notify the Japanese government that if Japan occupied Hainan Island, Britain and France would regard it as an act of deliberately causing unpleasant disputes. The British and French governments should assist each other to adapt to the needs of the situation, without any doubt." This statement is still valid today. The right-wing Le Journal stated, "The only goal of the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island is to prepare to cut off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which is one of the remaining channels for China to receive foreign assistance." It does not seem appropriate to lodge a formal protest at this time. It would be better to take a vigilant attitude and, together with Britain, pay attention to future developments. Because if this island is occupied by Japan, the extent to which Britain feels threatened is actually equal to that of France. Other newspapers compared the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island with the Spanish Nationalists' occupation of the Mediterranean island of Menorca. The radical socialist L'Œuvre stated, "These two events are clear evidence that the German-Italian-Japanese tripartite alliance is secretly implementing its plan, which is to threaten the communication lines of the British and French democracies and put them at a disadvantage." The radical socialist La République stated that Germany and Italy were extremely dissatisfied with the attempts of Britain and France to mediate the Spanish Civil War. "The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island may be a retaliatory measure taken by the three countries that signed the Anti-Comintern Pact after mutual consultation, which is not necessarily the case." The right-wing Le Petit Journal stated, "If the Japanese army intends to occupy Hainan Island for a long time, it is another act of violating the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington. The United States, as the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty, should take the lead in declaring that the treaty has been violated and should make demands on Japan, take action, or conduct negotiations with it." (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island in China, responsible sources here recently stated that the French government should make representations to the Japanese government, informing them that France's prohibition of arms from being transported to China via French Vietnam was in the hope that Japan would abandon its attempts on Hainan Island as an exchange condition. In addition, France and Japan had agreed on an issue regarding Hainan Island that any action that is detrimental to the other party should be avoided. France will certainly have reasons to argue. Britain and France should also take a common stance and consider joint action, which is also possible, but they should pay attention to developments and make a formal decision only after Japan explains its intentions. (Havas dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to sources in Parisian political circles, the British and French governments will lodge sharp protests against the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. According to Le Journal and Le Figaro, British Ambassador Sir Phipps visited French Foreign Minister Bonnet last night and discussed the wording of the protest. However, it is not yet known whether Britain and France will protest to Tokyo separately or jointly. (Haitong dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government is currently paying close attention to the situation on Hainan Island. Responsible parties have not yet issued statements regarding France's views. However, it is expected that if Japan does not interfere with trade between Hainan Island and Vietnam, France may not lodge representations. (Reuters dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government is temporarily maintaining a patient attitude tonight regarding the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. Hainan Island is a military stronghold on the coast of South China. Japanese warships and aircraft can now threaten French Indochina from there. Officials stated that the government will pursue diplomatic channels or consult with the British government before lodging a protest against Japan's actions. However, according to the impression gained by officials, France does not seem likely to turn this into an incident at present. French officials said that Japan's actions have not violated France's rights and interests on the island, whether under the Sino-French Agreement of 1897 or the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907. However, it is a fundamental violation of the promises recently made by Japan to Britain and France. Although the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is enough to threaten French territory, the French government is now awaiting Japan to reveal its true intentions for the island. France apparently does not object to Japan's temporary occupation of the island, but the Japanese army must withdraw from the island when China restores peace. (Associated Press dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French newspapers today all oppose the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island. Several newspapers advocated that the French government should join the British government in lodging a strong protest with Tokyo. Le Parisien said that the unity of Britain and France is most evident in the Far East. The two governments should now be vigilant to deal with Japan. Several other newspapers said that Menorca and Hainan Island were occupied at the same time, which proves that the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo triangle is making sincere efforts to carry out its plan to oppose the democracies.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Intention in Attacking Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Since occupying Guangzhou, the Japanese army has been clamoring for a large-scale attack on the southwest. However, on the land front, it has run into walls on three routes and has instead fallen into encirclement, unable to break through. Naval warships have been hovering in Tokyo Bay and entering and exiting the Qiongzhou Strait for a long time, without any action. But on the 10th of this month, they suddenly landed on Hainan Island, attempting to occupy the largest island along the Chinese coast.</p>
<p>Hainan Island has an area of 33,000 square kilometers, and the Wuzhi Mountain range covers the entire island. Only the coastal areas are relatively flat, with highways encircling the island. The Japanese army's target is Qiongshan in the north and Haikou Port outside Qiongshan. However, Haikou is covered with beaches, and ordinary merchant ships are not allowed to dock there. Therefore, the Japanese army landed at Qinglan Port in the east of the island and Lingao Port in the north of the island, and in two routes, they converged along the highway to attack Qiongshan and Haikou. Haikou and Haian in Leizhou Peninsula are only more than 20 kilometers apart. The Japanese army's occupation of the area is certainly a great threat to southern Guangdong. However, if the Japanese army wants to attack the southwest, it should concentrate its forces to capture Beihai in order to advance into Yongning and control the heart of the southwest. Why go so far and use Hainan Island, which is isolated in the South China Sea, as a base? Frankly speaking, since the fall of Guangzhou, Hainan Island has lost its importance in China's defense. The Japanese authorities know this. Therefore, their capture of Hainan Island is not a military strategy to attack southern China, but it has other important functions.</p>
<p>Originally, Hainan Island and French Vietnam are only separated by a narrow strip of water. If the Japanese army occupies the island, it will be a most serious oppression to France's Far Eastern colonies, making France's defense in Vietnam completely ineffective. At the same time, Hainan Island is also the hub of the South China Sea. From Hainan Island to British Singapore and American Philippines, a fan shape can be drawn, and this fan-shaped area encompasses all of the British, Dutch, and American South Sea Islands. The end of the fan handle is Hainan Island. Therefore, the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is simply aimed at becoming the leader of the South China Sea and is clearly challenging all countries in the world.</p>
<p>Currently in Europe, Italy is desperately pressing France, and the situation in Spain is deteriorating rapidly, putting France in a most serious predicament. Germany is also eager to try and settle centuries of old accounts with France. Japan is taking advantage of this opportunity to attack Hainan Island, as if saying that if a European war breaks out, Japan can cross this narrow strip of water and occupy Vietnam as easily as it occupied Qingdao 24 years ago. It can be said to be a most opportunistic bargain. If a European war does not break out for a while, Japan's control over the Far East has already been strengthened. Not only is Haiphong and Saigon placed within the reach of danger, but Singapore and Manila will also feel uneasy. This is naturally considered by Japan to be a deal with multiple benefits.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese warlords are dreaming beautiful dreams, but the beautiful dreams are ultimately difficult to come true. First, Hainan Island will not be easily occupied by the Japanese warlords. China's close contact with the Li ethnic group for thousands of years and the lessons of the ethnic struggle at the end of the Southern Song Dynasty have made the compatriots in Qiongyai the most heroic, most alert, most enduring, and most nationalistic members of the Chinese nation. As soon as the Japanese army lands on Hainan Island, a guerrilla war will immediately break out at the foot of the Wuzhi Mountains, digging a new grave for the Japanese navy in southern China. Just imagine, even if the Japanese army occupies Qiongshan, can it completely occupy all the coastal areas? Even if it occupies all the coastal areas, can it completely control the Wuzhi Mountain range? Therefore, this move by the Japanese army is no different from finding another place to consume troops, and it will soon realize that this is a foolish act of tying its own hands.</p>
<p>Second, because of the Hainan Island incident, the world's democracies will also have a deeper understanding of Japan and will rise up to take more practical sanctions. Britain and France have protested to Japan more than once because of the Far Eastern issue, but the facts have proved that protests on paper are of no use at all. The Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907 has also been torn up by Japan's move. Having learned many lessons, will they still act politely this time and engage in a paper war with Japan? Reports say that the Paris government plans not to protest the Hainan Island incident, which is actually an implication of taking actions beyond protest and is by no means a tacit approval of violence. In addition, Britain and the United States will probably have to unite and sanction this demon of the world. Therefore, the fall of the port of Barcelona in Spain will promote the unity of the democracies on their attitude towards Europe. The occupation of Hainan Island in China will also inevitably promote the unity and strengthening of British, French, and American actions in the Far East. We dare to predict that Japan's wishful thinking on Hainan Island will not succeed!</p>
<h3>British and French Interests Are All Threatened</h3>
<p>(London) All newspapers here this morning published lengthy editorials about the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. The "Times" diplomatic correspondent pointed out that this occupation threatens the interests of both Britain and France. The transportation between Vietnam and Guangzhou Bay, in particular, is being controlled by the occupiers of Hainan Island. The correspondent mentioned that the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Butler, reported in the House of Commons last June that "The British and French governments have warned Japan that if it occupies Hainan Island, it will inevitably cause unpleasant disputes. If circumstances require, the British and French governments will assist each other to deal with such disputes." Therefore, London government officials are now carefully considering appropriate countermeasures for Japan's actions. (Eleventh day, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island has made the newspapers here uneasy. The "Times" reported that the Japanese government hopes that foreign countries will not misinterpret it. "Because Hainan Island is sufficient to control French Vietnam and the French concession of Guangzhou Bay, the British and French governments cannot but feel anxious." Thereupon, the "Times" also recounted the statement made by Foreign Office official Butler in the House of Commons on June 27th of last year, and inferred, "The British government is considering ways to respond to the impact on the interests of Britain and France and the Japanese government's previous promise of having no territorial ambitions." (Eleventh day, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Testing the Degree of British-French Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the United States government today, if Japan permanently occupies Hainan Island and establishes naval and air force bases on the island, it will completely change the strategic position of the Western Pacific. Therefore, the United States will be forced to strengthen its defense forces in the Pacific, of which Guam will be immediately armed. Because Hainan Island is only six hundred miles from the Philippine Islands, and is also adjacent to French Annam and British Hong Kong, it threatens the bases of the United States, Britain, and France in the Far East. (Tenth day, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China was recently commented on by responsible American figures, who said that this is a political gesture to test whether the attitudes of Britain and France towards Far Eastern affairs are firm or weak. Japan is a signatory to the Anti-Comintern Pact. Its sending troops to land on Hainan Island is to test how strong British and French resistance is. In the United States, because the island belongs to Chinese territory, it is not planning to take any diplomatic action or make any other representations. (Tenth day, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China was recently commented on by the "New York Times," which said, "Since Japan began its military actions to conquer China, it has shown no greater contempt for the public opinion of Western democracies than in this attempt to occupy Hainan Island. This matter is of great significance to Britain, France, and the Netherlands. As for the United States, if it feels concerned about the Philippine Islands even for a single day, then it cannot ignore this action of Japan for even a single day. At this moment, Japan has already cut across the sea transportation line between British Singapore and Hong Kong Island. The seriousness of this nature and the breadth of the impact on many countries, although there are not many places in the world that have as great a relationship with Hainan Island as other vital locations. Furthermore, Japan's expansion policy is currently using Hainan Island as its southernmost point. Its meaning is far greater than the so-called 'military needs' and the so-called weakening of China. The conquest of Asia and the conquest of Europe are originally one problem, and another clear proof can be obtained here." (Tenth day, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Manila) Today, the newspapers here prominently published the news of the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island and the death of the Pope. Government officials, according to the traditional practice, did not criticize this action of the Japanese army, because the status of the Philippine Republic is under the control of the United States. Well-informed sources believe that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, especially after the Japanese army invaded South China, the public's enthusiasm for Philippine independence has been greatly reduced. After the Japanese army occupies Hainan Island, it may extinguish this enthusiasm. The editorial of the "Philippine People's Voice" predicted that after the Japanese army occupies Hainan Island, it will make the policies of Britain, France, and the United States towards the Far East more clearly expressed. However, based on the current situation in Europe, Britain and France may not be able to make other representations other than strong protests. Therefore, the responsibility for this action should be borne by the United States. (Eleventh day, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>German Political Circles Express Satisfaction</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island in China, German political figures all expressed satisfaction. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had notified General Ott, the German ambassador to Japan, of the country's internal intentions. The "German General Report" recently commented that the Japanese army's action can make the tense relations between Japan and Western countries even more intensified. The "Evening News" said that the bases held by Britain, France, and the United States in the Haifu part of China have formed a triangular situation, namely Hong Kong, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Now, the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island has destroyed one of the strongholds within this triangular situation. It is expected that the French government will protest to Japan. (Tenth day, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island in China, political figures here were very happy. They said that this decision was Japan's response to "a certain intimidation plan by Western democracies." Its significance in military strategy and diplomacy is both significant and sufficient to curb China's arms supply. (Eleventh day, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian side is paying close attention to the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China. The newspapers have commented on it, saying that this action has a decisive force for the future development of the Sino-Japanese War. The island has various advantages in military strategy. The Japanese army can rely on it to prevent ships from various countries from approaching the Chinese Sea, and make the two bases of British Hong Kong Island and the French concession of Guangzhou Bay lose their effectiveness. Before the Japanese army landed on the island, it had notified the governments of Italy and Germany of this intention in advance. (Eleventh day, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army on the Nanxun Line Is Very Busy With Movements</h3>
<p>Wanjiafu The Japanese army on the Nanxun front has been very busy with movements recently, so the front line is quite calm. It is said that more than 10,000 newly arrived Japanese troops from Jiujiang are transported by car to De'an Yongxiu every night. The Japanese army on the Ruiwu Road front has been continuously transporting supplies to Ruoxi and the north bank of the Xiu River with hundreds of transport vehicles. (Tenth day telegram)</p>
<p>Wanjiafu There are no battles on the Luohe front line. Only at 11 o'clock, the Japanese army northwest of Qiujin on the north bank fired more than 60 shells at the Tong'anling Lion Mountain area of the Chinese army. The shells fell on the wilderness, and the Chinese army suffered no losses. (Eleventh day telegram)</p>

<h3>The Pope's Remains Moved to the Sistine Chapel The Public Flocked to Pay Their Respects The Italian King Issued an Edict for National Mourning for Eight Days</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian King issued an edict for mourning the Pope for eight days. Groups of people went to the altars of various churches to light candles and pray, non-stop throughout the day. All theaters and cinemas were closed tonight to express mourning. At 4 p.m., 5,000 people lined up in St. Peter's Square to await the public display of the Pope's remains. The Vatican authorities originally intended to only allow those with special privileges to enter the Sistine Chapel, but because more and more people gathered, they decided to open the doors of the chapel to accommodate all walks of life. Believers were allowed to enter and kneel and pass by. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was also among those who paid their respects. Ciano represented the Fascist government and knelt beside the Pope's remains with Cardinal Basili, the Secretary of State of the Holy See, to recite prayers. The Pope was rich in knowledge, governed with sincerity, and had a fearless spirit, emphasizing humanitarianism. Therefore, the Roman political circles were also deeply saddened by the news of his death. The Italian King and Mussolini originally planned to attend the 10th anniversary celebration of the establishment of the political and religious harmony agreement at St. Peter's Basilica next Sunday. Today, workers are removing many red silk decorations from the memorial service. (Tenth day, Reuters)</p>
<p>Vatican City Pope Pius XI died this morning due to a recurrence of his old illness. All newspapers here issued extra editions.

The Italian court decided to mourn for eight days. Thousands of Catholics in St. Peter's Church couldn't help but shed tears and kneel to pray after suddenly hearing the funeral bells. This afternoon, the Pope's remains have been moved to the Vatican Sistine Chapel. Italian nobles, the diplomatic corps, and Vatican officials were able to pay their respects. The Pope's remains will be moved to St. Peter's Church tomorrow, where the public will line up to pay their respects. Everything in the Holy See is temporarily under the responsibility of Cardinal Bazeli, the Secretary of State of the Holy See, while waiting for the papal election to elect a successor.

After the establishment of the Rome-Berlin Axis, the Pope did not hesitate to join forces with the democracies and constantly made provocative moves. Since last year, he has even intensified his opposition to racism. His deliberate attempt to sabotage the Rome-Berlin Axis can be seen here. Now he has passed away with his ambitions unfulfilled."

In addition to theology and philosophy, he was also familiar with the science of the times. He was in charge of the world's church affairs, and his deployment was well-organized, regardless of the magnitude. He spared no effort in promoting canine Catholicism, which is unforgettable. However, Pius X did not have a deep understanding of the current political system movement, so it was inevitable that he would have disagreements with Germany and Italy. It is said that from the 12th to the 14th, from noon to 1 p.m. every day, the Catholic churches in Berlin will strike bells to express mourning. (Eleventh day, Haitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>Brazil Welcomes American Immigrants Hoping for American Commercial Loans to Resist German Economic Aggression</h3>
<p>(Washington) After Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha arrived here, he met with Deputy Secretary of State Welles this morning to discuss general relations between the two sides. The meeting lasted for two hours. According to well-informed sources, Foreign Minister Aranha proposed that the United States government help unemployed workers immigrate to Brazil to engage in agriculture and mining. He said that this plan can not only relieve unemployment, but also revitalize Brazilian industries. It can be said to be a win-win situation. Brazil is rich in iron ore, coal, and oil. Once developed, it can greatly benefit American industries and American immigrants in Brazil. In addition, after a large number of American unemployed workers immigrate to Brazil, Brazil's demand for American goods will also increase accordingly. This can be said to be all good for the United States. In addition, Foreign Minister Aranha also met with Deputy Secretary of State Welles and said, "Germany is using generous lending policies to carry out economic aggression in Brazil. I hope that the United States will broaden its horizons and adopt wise commercial lending policies as a countermeasure, and not be stingy about Brazil's bad debts."

The government should now investigate the number of Japanese expatriates. During the investigation, Japanese expatriates are not allowed to leave their place of residence unless they have written permission from local officials. In addition, Japanese fishermen should also be prohibited from fishing in Cuban territorial waters, and those who already live in various strategic locations should be ordered to relocate.

<h3>Irish Party Members Carry Out Terrorist Activities Causing Anxiety in London</h3>

Residents of the city heard three explosions in a row at night, all coming from the winter camp. When the police rushed to investigate after hearing the sound, the fire had indeed started. The police authorities believe that this was done by terrorists. In addition, rumors spread in London this morning that terrorists were about to blow up London Bridge (on the River Thames). After investigation by the police, two suspects have been arrested. London Bridge and Southwark Bridge are heavily guarded by the military police to prevent accidents.

<h3>Five Hundred Thousand Young Men and Women Serving the Country in the Rear: Xishan Enthusiastically Engaged in Propaganda and Relief Work, Striving for National Liberation Through Hard Work</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: In the nineteen months since the July 7th Incident, the victory in national salvation work is what Chinese youth have felt most honored about. This has not only gained the sympathy of people across the country, but also the praise of people all over the world. Since the beginning of China's full-scale war of resistance, Chinese youth have indeed done a lot of practical national salvation work. These more than 500,000 young men and women scattered in various inland areas, from any point of view, their spirit is enough to express their enthusiasm for the country.</p>
<p>In fact, under this all-out war of resistance, every young person has felt the importance of their own responsibility. Stirred by their passionate emotions, they could no longer bear to sit still in the classroom. So they left school. A part of the youth bravely rushed to the front lines. They joined formal armies, or formed small guerrilla units to engage in direct resistance against the enemy. The best example is the young university students in Tianjin and Beiping. Most of the young men and women, although they did not stand on the front lines to fight, they are very busy serving in the rear.</p>
<p>In many areas such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Changsha, and Xi'an, many political propaganda work, relief work for wounded soldiers, and refugee resettlement work are now entirely undertaken by young people. What is most admirable is the youth from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They used to live a very comfortable metropolitan life in Shanghai, but today they are serving in the inland areas. They not only do not feel uncomfortable with the life, but their spirit of service is even better than others.</p>
<p>What we should mention is the efforts of young women in participating in the war of resistance. In many hospitals in the inland areas, female students are serving as nurses to wounded soldiers. The best phenomenon is that they treat the wounded soldiers as their own brothers. They talk to them, comfort them, write letters home, sing, and read war news. They have a slogan that says, "Reducing the suffering of wounded soldiers and restoring their health is our first responsibility!"</p>
<p>(Situation of the departure of the Women's Relief Team)</p>
<p>Many young women are also receiving military training. They put on military uniforms, cut their hair short, and at sunrise, they are already drilling in the square with guns on their backs.</p>
<p>In every university or middle school in Chongqing, there are at least eight hours of military subjects per week. Their daily lives are all militarized. Attending classes, eating, getting up, and exercising are all lived under the same discipline. In the suburbs, there are often teams of young student soldiers conducting field exercises. Agile and accurate movements symbolize that everyone is a brave future.</p>
<p>In terms of propaganda work, they are expanding their efforts. At the same time, many school professors are also helping to participate. Their highest goal is to improve the knowledge of the general public in order to strengthen and consolidate the patriotic sentiments of the people. They have decided on four guidelines to promote this work: Teach illiterate masses to write and read. Enlighten the masses' thoughts on national salvation. Train farmers to improve farming and handicraft production. Train the people on how to organize themselves to resist aggression. Under this plan, many young people are engaged in various different ways to achieve this goal. They run in teams and districts to various villages and cities, organizing drama and singing troupes, performing dramas of national salvation everywhere, and teaching the public to sing songs of national salvation. Mr. Liu Liangmo, a composer of mass songs, led many young men and women to work in various parts of Changsha. These means of realistic propaganda containing high awareness awakened the will of the masses to resist the war.</p>
<p>Many university students in Chengdu organized rural service groups, using their holidays to work in nearby rural areas. They established temporary schools and public night schools, gathering nearby farmers to study, establishing mobile libraries, and traveling to give lectures, telling wartime knowledge such as air defense, poison gas prevention, and first aid. In the summer of last year, students from various universities in Chongqing, including Fudan University and Central University, successively organized economic investigation groups in various provinces (some also joined economic investigation groups organized by the authorities) to investigate Guiyang and southwestern provinces, and achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>At the Northwest Anti-Japanese War University, many young men and women are training in difficult lives. The graduates of each session are assigned to lead important anti-Japanese war work in various places, totaling five or six thousand people.</p>
<p>Secondly, in Chongqing, under the leadership of Ms. Soong Mei-ling, hundreds of young women are also being trained, and they will also undertake special rear service work.</p>
<p>In summary: In the past year or so, Chinese youth have been tense and successful in their work of resisting the war and saving the country. Every young person serving in the inland areas is not only enthusiastic, but also actually working hard. There is no individual among them, but they care for the group with each other. In the arduous struggle, they hope to open up a new path and seek true national liberation!</p>
<h3>Promoting Rear Area Construction: Guiyang Today (Continued)</h3>
<p>In terms of publishing, there are more than ten regular publications, including the Provincial Government Gazette, New Daxia Monthly, Anti-Japanese Weekly, and National Construction Review. Magazines from Chongqing can also be seen quickly after three days. As for newspapers, there were originally two types: Guizhou Morning Post and Revolutionary Daily, printed by lithography. After the fall of Wuhan, Wuhan Daily was renamed Guiyang Central Daily and moved to Chu for publication. The Provincial Library is the only complete mental food library here, with a collection of about 50,000 books, more than 200 types of magazines, and more than 40 types of newspapers. However, there are so many restaurants and hotels in Guiyang City, but there is only one mental restaurant. How can it satisfy so many readers with strong appetites? Therefore, the appeal to the education authorities to fill the library and add more reading rooms can often be seen in newspapers. In addition, there is a provincial public education center, where there are also daily newspapers and magazines. Educational, air defense, and anti-virus films are also shown in the square every night, which has a great effect on instilling knowledge in the public. The drama movement is very vigorous in Guiyang. There are eight or nine amateur theater groups such as Wolf Fire, Sand Camel, and Daxia. Most of them are school students. On average, there is always one theater group performing every month. Bookstores such as Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, Zhengzhong Bookstore, Beixin Bookstore, and Life Bookstore all have branches. The prices of books here do not increase, only adding 2% for shipping. Since the end of last year, the provincial government established a radio station, which broadcasts from 6 pm every day.</p>
<p>Transportation situation: There are health test institutes. In addition to the Provincial Hospital, the Nanjing Central Hospital has also recently moved here. The equipment and medicines are more complete, which is very convenient for patients. There are buses in the city, but they have closed down due to poor business. Therefore, there are only rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages. Guiyang is also the center of the Sichuan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Guizhou, Guangxi-Guizhou, and Hunan-Guizhou highways. The Southwest Highway Transportation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation is located here. The station is outside Zhongshanmen. Each of the four roads has a bus once a day. The price to Haitang on the opposite bank of Chongqing is 20.50 yuan, to Kunming is 29.15 yuan, to Liuzhou is 27.80 yuan, and to Changsha is 44.40 yuan. Nowadays, passengers to Chongqing and Kunming are too crowded, and you must register in order to purchase tickets. This waiting list has already reached March of this year. There is also a section bus on the Guiyang (Guiyang to Dingyang to Bijie) highway, which is specially opened by the Highway Bureau of the Construction Department. In addition to highway buses, the transport of mules and horses is also an important means of transportation. Dozens of horses transport pots, wood, bricks, and things needed by Guiyang from other counties. When they go back, they carry salt, sugar, matches, and other daily necessities used by other counties. The people who drive the horses live in the wild all year round. Their great endurance and perseverance are really admirable. Recently, China Airlines has resumed flights between Yu and Chu, flying back and forth three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which makes the distance between Xi Qing and Guiyang shorter. There are also 300 telephones in the city. The China Travel Service has achieved great results in serving the Southwest. In addition to cooperating with the Southwest Highway Bureau to operate dining and accommodation stations on the Southwest Highway, the provincial government has entrusted it to run a guest house here. The nature of the guest house is similar to that of a hotel. The furnishings are clean and simple. There is table tennis and the ball skills. The members of the Central Committee and senators who pass through Chu stay in the guest house. There are two cinemas in the city. The Qianyang Grand Stage is a Sichuan opera and Ping opera theater with Yu Chu.</p>
<p>Social dynamics: Coal is the most abundant product. It can be found along the highway, so the aborigines use their own soil method to refine coal. The output of iron and wood is very considerable. White fungus is very cheap, and the locals do not regard it as a treasure. When a newcomer to Guiyang enters the suburbs, he can see many eye-catching slogans with artistic fonts. The National Art College painted a lot of huge oil paintings and comics on the streets. The Children's Theater Troupe of the Political Department, with more than 60 children, traveled more than 10,000 miles. This time, they spent the New Year in Guiyang. Although it was only a few days, their efforts left an indelible impression. The second phase of the Guiyang Youth Spring Men and Women's Battlefield Work Service Group has departed for the front line. The winter vacation is approaching, and the students are organizing rural propaganda teams, preparing to go deep into every corner. The cold clothing donation pushed from Guiyang has just remitted 200,000, while the one-yuan debt repayment campaign in response to Shanghai is also unfolding rapidly. Charity sales are even more rampant in the city. At least one day of charity sales is held in each industry. Guiyang doctors recorded a glorious day in the medical industry with their charity donations. These are all comprehensive results of everyone's patriotic enthusiasm and the intentional support of this patriotic enthusiasm. In these places, Guiyang seems too young. Usually everyone is working seriously. On the street, you can see a firm smile on the face of every pedestrian.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth from Dasheng Textile Mill Detained by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Nantong Correspondence: Since the fall of Nantong and Haimen, the Japanese special service agencies and local puppet organizations have coveted the industry in Jiangbei, especially the Dasheng Textile Mill, which is the first to bear the brunt. They do not hesitate to collude with each other, secretly plotting to destroy it. This has been going on for several months. On the surface, they still want to maintain the facade of friendship and dare not openly invade. In fact, they have been destroying it in every possible way recently. A few days ago, a large batch of more than 500 pieces of cloth from the Dasheng No. 3 Mill in Haimen were shipped to Shanghai. After import, they were suddenly detained by the Japanese special service agency without asking any questions. It is said that a large amount of goods from the Dasheng No. 1 Mill were also detained. I am afraid that if the Japanese army does not leave, it will be difficult to maintain the industry in Jiangbei.</p>

<h3>The Western Government Regroups and Decides to Continue the War: Government Agencies Move Back to Madrid; Miaja Appointed Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>Madrid: Spanish Prime Minister Negrín has announced that Madrid is the seat of the Spanish Republican government. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Bilbao: The Western Republican government announced today that the government army is determined to continue the war and defend the territory of the central and southern parts of Spain. Its headquarters will be located in Madrid. According to the superiority of that place in resisting the rebels, it has been almost three years. The Republican government issued this announcement in the official gazette, signed jointly by Prime Minister Negrín and the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the government armies, General Miaja. After Dr. Negrín arrived in Valencia by plane, he immediately ordered reinforcements to the government army, including women working on the front lines. General Miaja's subordinates include a total of 250,000 people, the most elite unit since the beginning of the Western War. It is expected that this decision will start a more intense war of resistance. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín reiterated today his determination to continue the war until the conditions he put forward in Congress on February 1 are fulfilled, and announced that Madrid will once again be the seat of the government. The conditions put forward by Mr. Nai are as follows: Guarantee the independence of Spain; Allow the Spanish people to decide their own political system; There shall be no retaliatory actions after the end of the war. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The various departments under the Republican government have moved to the cities of Valencia and Barcelona one after another, and it has been 27 months since then. Now they have returned here, the officials are very gratified, and the general residents are not afraid that the National Army will once again use this city as an attack target. General Miaja, the commander of the Central Route, has been ordered to stay since 1936. Although the National Army has repeatedly launched attacks, it has not succeeded. General Te's prestige has been greatly shaken and he has now been promoted to commander-in-chief of the Republican Army. The people all deeply believe in him. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Toulouse: It is said that Western Government Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Valyut have both gone to the Madrid area in order to discuss with the commanders-in-chief of the navy, army, and air force, Miaja's economic system. However, in order to conduct these negotiations, a formal ambassador must be stationed in the National Army government's location. This is because the Central Kingdom must recognize the National Government as the legitimate government of the Western Kingdom as soon as possible. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding France's appointment of an ambassador to the Spanish National Army government, Prime Minister Daladier had repeatedly communicated with social party leader and former cabinet prime minister Blum yesterday, and their opinions gradually converged. This news surprised the people in the House of Representatives, but Mr. Da's personal opinion was difficult to clear, and the party's position was solid and had no impact. The Socialist Party immediately passed a resolution resolutely opposing the government's dispatch of an ambassador to Burgos or recognizing the National Army government, and jointly issued a statement with the "French-Western Friendship Group" in the House of Representatives, publicly expressing support for Negrín to continue the war. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The evolving relationship between the United Kingdom, France, and the Spanish National Army is still of concern to Germany, which can be seen in the arguments of various newspapers. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" warned National Army Commander General Franco that the "strategies of the United Kingdom and France" had the following words: "The British and French authorities have expressed their friendship and offered their goodwill to General Franco, and the "Italian News" reporter stationed in London said that London and Paris hope that the National Army can accept economic assistance from the United Kingdom and France. Regarding the occupation of the Zhujia Islands, they sang the words of avoiding bloodshed again, which is also hypocrisy." "Jiang Huai Bao" reported that France attempted to win over Burgos and make the Spanish National Army a vassal of France. Although this attempt can never come true, the general public believes that the power of money is great and that it cannot be prevented. "Fascist Gongbao" reported that the British government's policy hopes to end the Western Civil War as soon as possible and use diplomatic means to unite with the victor, which is now obvious.

<h3>All of Catalonia is Under the Control of the National Army</h3>
<p>Barcelona: The National Army launched an offensive in the Catalonia Autonomous Region with a force of 350,000, which lasted for 50 days. Now it has completely occupied the region. Looking back at the course of the war, before the National Army arrived at the city of Bagas, Burenjas, the progress was slow due to the difficulty in the progress of the Italian troops. Until the siege of Barcelona, the government troops gradually retreated. The National Army took advantage of the momentum to occupy all the land in the Catalonia Autonomous Region. As a result, the government army's sea routes are only</p>
<h3>Semi-Official Organ of Italy Reaffirms Territorial Demands: Says It Will Not Hesitate to Fight If It Does Not Get Satisfaction</h3>
<p>(London) According to the diplomatic circles here today, due to the obstruction of the death of Pope Pius, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may postpone his territorial demands on France. It is said that while the Pope was dying, he still whispered prayers for world peace, so it does not seem to be an opportunity for the Italian Prime Minister to wield his sword at this time. It is generally believed that before the selection of a successor to the Pope is determined, Mussolini will find it difficult to make the general public interested in territorial demands. It is generally believed that the Pope has been working for peace until his death, and has also made contributions to European peace. The death of the Pope has not without causing the diplomatic offensive of Germany and Italy to fall into difficulties. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official organ "International Relations Consolidation Magazine" published an article today reaffirming various territorial demands, saying that France must cede Tunisia, the Suez Canal, Djibouti Port, Corsica, and Nice Port to Italy, otherwise Italy is prepared to go to war, and in order to monitor France's policy, Italian volunteers in Spain should not be ordered to withdraw. The full text reads: Italy and Germany's various demands are based on international justice, so no threats to various civil governments can contain these demands. "Italy's actions in Spain will enable the overall situation in Europe to be preserved. Italian volunteers will never be withdrawn until the National Army has won a solid victory. In other words, Italian volunteers must wait until France's policy is fully understood by us before withdrawing. France has stated that preventing other countries from interfering in Spain's internal affairs is a matter of vital interest to France. This is the case for France, and why not for Italy? Therefore, it is urgent for Italian volunteers to stay in Spain to monitor the development of France's policy. In short, if France insists on rejecting Italy's various natural desires, the result will not only be harmful to France, but also to the overall situation in Europe. Because if Italy's desires cannot be satisfied through negotiations, it can only be resolved by force. Which of the two to choose? The French government and people must have something to choose from." (Omitted below) (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>35,000 Tons: German New Battleship, Three Completed, One to Be Launched</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany's largest battleship of 35,000 tons built after the war, now known as F, is scheduled to be launched on February 14. The ceremony will be very grand. Government officials and party leaders will participate. It is generally believed that Hitler will personally attend the ceremony and deliver a speech. The name of this ship has not yet been announced. It may be named after a German celebrity such as Huenmai or Hindenburg, but it may also be named after a place to commemorate Germany's victory last year. The shipyard building this ship is now preparing to be greatly decorated to celebrate its success. German newspapers have now published articles pointing out that this ship will be the first to fully realize Germany's maritime power. Germany will occupy a position among the great maritime powers from now on. It is expected that the speed of this new ship can be used by France and Italy, which cannot be compared with the same battleships left over from the past. This is because all the improvements gained from years of research and experience are placed in this ship. According to Germany's large battleships, there are three Fs as the first. The other two are one G, which can be tested in the summer, and one H. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>The United Kingdom Is Determined to Make Every Effort to Maintain World Peace: International Disputes Should Be Resolved Through Negotiations; British Naval Power Is Sufficient to Maintain Traffic Safety</h3>
<p>Plymouth: Home Secretary Hoare delivered a speech at the banquet of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce here tonight, saying, "If the issue of raw material supply becomes the cause of future international disputes, then we have no reason at this time to refuse to resolve this issue, and even all commercial issues, through negotiations." The suggestions I made to the League of Nations in 1935 when I was the Foreign Secretary are still valid today, and I hope that people of insight from all countries will respond. As far as British foreign policy is concerned, we are determined to do everything possible to maintain peace, but the various interests that are vital to survival, as well as the friendship we have with our friendly countries, must also be maintained. Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent statement on the relationship between the United Kingdom and France is a clear proof of this. The integrity of the British Empire must be defended. "If the Empire is unfortunately weakened or even disintegrated one day, then the main hope of maintaining international peace will disappear within the next few hundred years." At this point, Home Secretary Hoare praised the strength of the British Navy and the expansion of naval armaments, saying, "According to past war experience and the major technological advances gained since the European War, we believe that the United Kingdom will no longer be threatened by submarines at sea." The United Kingdom and the United States both aim to maintain peace. The strong naval power of the United States is a matter of great comfort. The strength of our fleet "is also sufficient to carry out its main responsibilities. In other words, the British Navy can fully protect the overseas traffic lines of the British Empire."

<h3>Yellow River Expert Expresses Opinion</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Famous Yellow River expert Cao Shumin (transliteration) wrote an article published in this morning's Shishi Xinbao, saying that the Central Government must immediately block the breaches in the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou and Zhaokou (transliteration), and guide the flood through Haizhou to the sea at Linhongkou (transliteration). Mr. Cao agreed with Su Shen Han Guojun's call for the government to find a way to deal with the Yellow River flood to save the 10 million people in northern Jiangsu. Mr. Cao also said that after the Yellow River flood flows into the Huai River, the nine counties in northern Jiangsu are now in danger of being completely flooded. He suggested that water should be diverted northward from Hongze Lake and into the Lutang River (transliteration), and then follow the Mu River (transliteration) through Haizhou and Linhongkou into the sea. In addition to the Yellow River issue, for military reasons, the government must also save the nine counties in northern Jiangsu, because the Chinese side can use the area as a base for a future counterattack to the Shanghai area.

<p>Madrid: Republican Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Valyut have successively arrived in central Spain, so the people of Madrid are now sharpening their weapons and waiting to continue the war. The doubts about the war will be carried out by us have now been cleared up. General Miaja's appointment as commander-in-chief of the navy, army, and air force can be regarded as the government's determination to resist the war. The national will to fight has not diminished, and all newspapers say that the government's strength is still strong, and encourage the military and civilians to make their greatest efforts.

<h3>England and France to Unconditionally Recognize Franco's Government; Germany and Italy Watch Future Situation, Mocking England and France's Hopes to Profit from Opportunity</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government, according to observations from well-informed sources in political circles here, the governments of England and France may soon unconditionally recognize it as the legitimate government. It is also said that the British Cabinet on the 14th of this month, and the French Cabinet the following day, will make separate decisions on this matter. It is believed that if England and France were to prepare for recognition while simultaneously proposing conditions for exchange, it would be of no benefit. There are three reasons for this: 1. If the Nationalist authorities refuse to accept these conditions, the position of England and France will be diminished as a result. 2. If the Republican government feels encouraged by this and continues the war, the impact will not be enough to salvage their failure and will only increase their losses. 3. At this juncture, only expressing goodwill towards General Franco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist forces, can promote the country's independence and neutrality. Apart from these three points, future negotiations between Britain and the Spanish Nationalist authorities on financial aid, the withdrawal of Italian volunteer soldiers, and the possibility of the Spanish Nationalist government joining the Anti-Comintern Pact will all become topics of discussion. British political figures also declare that when the Nationalist forces initiated their uprising in July 1936, they originally "aimed to eradicate communism within Spain. It would not be easy to prevent them from joining the Anti-Comintern Pact at this point. However, in reality, the signatory countries of this pact retain the right to act independently, so joining or not joining does not have much significance." As for the issue of financial aid, Britain should do its utmost to dissuade the Nationalist authorities from adopting fascist principles to establish an economic system. In essence, Britain's financial assistance to the Nationalist government hinges on whether General Franco maintains liberalism, which would prove that the interference of various countries in Spanish internal affairs has already changed its direction. Since General Franco's recovery of Catalonia, England and France have suddenly shown him favor. This is a significant success outside of military matters for General Franco and he can certainly be proud of it, but he must carefully examine the motives of these countries, which are no different from their previous support for the government forces. In other words, they are simply hoping to profit from the opportunity. This should also be well understood by General Franco. As for the sake of Spain's national interests, having received the assistance of Germany and Italy during times of hardship, he should know how to repay those countries. In the future, joining the Anti-Comintern Pact would be the right course of action. The "Public Observation News" also states that England and France's interference in Spanish affairs is increasing day by day, resulting in expressions of dissatisfaction. The British authorities aim for the Spanish Nationalist government to declare neutrality. "Britain has interfered in Spanish internal affairs for hundreds of years and intends to continue this policy. The fact that Gibraltar belongs to Britain is a symbol of this policy." (Havas dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian public expresses suspicion regarding the Western democracies' change in attitude towards the Spanish Nationalist forces. Most people believe that this move is purely aimed at the ports of Valencia and Cartagena in the Western countries, as these ports are frequently bombed by Nationalist aircraft, making it very difficult for the government forces to obtain supplies from abroad.

<h3>American Ambassador to England Leaves America to Return to Post; Denies Predicting European War</h3>
<p>(New York) U.S. Ambassador to England, Kennedy, stated before boarding the "Queen Mary" today that he had met with President Roosevelt for two hours yesterday. However, I do not acknowledge the prediction made during a closed-door meeting of the Military Committee on January 10 with the U.S. Ambassador to France, Mr. Bullet, that a war would occur in Europe next quarter. His words said, "I have never predicted a war. I told you all when I arrived in the country that I am good at predicting the stock market and diplomatic affairs, but I am not a prophet, so I cannot predict a war." When asked if his return to England had any connection to the situation in Spain, Kennedy replied, "I am simply returning to my post to work." (Reuters dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<h3>American Nationals in Chongqing Urge Government to Stop Shipment of War Goods to Japan; U.S. Publishes Statistics on Arms Exports, Scrap Metal Shipments to Japan Have Not Yet Ceased</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) All American Nationals in Chongqing telegraphed Roosevelt, Hull, and members of Congress on the 11th, reporting on the atrocities of Japanese aircraft bombing Wanxian and Guiyang, and in the name of humanity and world peace, urged a halt to the shipment of oil, iron, and other materials to Japan. (Special dispatch of the 11th, 11:00 PM)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Two cargo ships previously planned to load 1,200 tons of scrap iron in Long Beach Port, California, for Japan. However, dockworkers refused to load the scrap iron onto the ships, and thousands of workers set up a cordon at the docks. The Chinese National Foreign Affairs Association recently sent a telegram expressing gratitude and hoped that they would continue their efforts, uniting with dockworker comrades across America to magnify this movement.

<p>(Washington) The State Department recently announced that the total value of American aircraft and munitions exported to various countries in January of this year was $4,630,587. Of this, $1,443,200 was exported to England, $1,289,746 to France, $98,180 to Japan, and $728,734 to the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. $64,328 was exported to China. As for arms dealers preparing to ship aircraft and munitions to various countries, the total value of export licenses applied for to the State Department in the middle of last month reached $6,271,030. Of this, all shipments to England were military aircraft, totaling $447,147. Shipments to France included both aircraft and munitions, totaling $969,366. Shipments to Japan included 2,396 tons of tinplate, totaling $43,574. (Havas dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<h3>Large Outflow of European Gold to America</h3>
<p>(New York) Recently, another large batch of gold from Europe has arrived in the United States. The latest batch, worth $60,000,000, has already been deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank. The bank's foreign gold reserves have exceeded $600,000,000. Most of it was shipped from England. While the stated reason is to stabilize exchange rates, such a large sum is not really necessary, and the intention is likely something else. According to Wall Street financial circles, European countries may want to store gold in the United States as reserves, so that in the event of war, they can use cash to purchase military supplies and raw materials according to the principle of assuming responsibility for transportation. The risk of transporting gold at that time would thus be avoided. (Havas dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<h3>Arab Representatives Present Four Demands: Abolish Mandate System, Recognize Independence, Immediately Stop Jewish Immigration to Palestine</h3>
<p>(London) When the British and Jewish representatives of the Palestine Conference met today, British Colonial Secretary MacDonald explained his views on various cases presented by the Jewish Agency. The Jewish delegation agreed to carefully consider the points made today and provide a response on Monday. The Arabs have already released a statement on yesterday's meeting, saying that their demands are based on the natural right of a people to reside in their country, and to safeguard the existence of their nation, and the natural desire to establish and develop their national existence in harmony and freedom without contradicting their customs and thoughts. It is not comparable to anti-Semitism and has nothing to do with hostility towards the English or other people. In October 1915, the British government made a promise to allow the Arabs to be independent. Repeated assurances have since been made to acknowledge the same promises, in order to repay the Arabs for their assistance in the Allied victory. Promises without substance. The Arabs have not gained independence. As for the Balfour Declaration or the British Mandate, the Arabs have never recognized it, nor do they intend to recognize it. The problem of finding a place to reside for displaced Jews is a matter for the entire civilized world, but the solution must not be in Palestine. What the Arabs are demanding now is: 1. Complete independence. 2. Abolition of the attempt to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. 3. Abolition of the mandate and its replacement with a treaty making Palestine a sovereign Arab state. 4. Immediate cessation of Jewish immigration and the purchase of land by Jews. The policies implemented in Palestine are unprecedentedly unfair to the Arabs. Unless this injustice is thoroughly rectified in accordance with recognized moral and egalitarian principles, there will be no peace in this holy land. The Arabs believe that the plans implemented under the mandate, such as facilitating Jewish immigration and land purchases, and other preferential treatment, have rendered the mandate ineffective and should be abolished. The Arabs are prepared to negotiate in a moderate spirit the conditions for safeguarding reasonable British interests, and accept the necessary guarantees to preserve the rights of access to the holy sites and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Jews and other minorities within Palestine. The Arabs' objections to the aforementioned policies can be summarized in the following three points: 1. The independence repeatedly promised during the European war has not been implemented. 2.

<h3>Puppet "Central China Government" Controls Imports; Yangtze River Goods Import Tax; Tax Collection Offices Established in Hupukou and Other Places; Starting Next Week, the Japanese Side Will Strictly Enforce</h3>
<p>Starting next week, the Japanese side will control all trade goods transported to the Yangtze River Delta area (crossroad estuary). It has guaranteed to the puppet "Central China Government" to manage the so-called "floating goods import tax," which the Japanese side will enforce in the occupied areas. According to the report notifying Chinese merchants, all trade goods transported to the Yangtze River estuary area, except for goods transported to Japanese warships for military use, will be subject to import taxes. This new tax collection office has also been established by the puppet "Central China Government" in Hupukou, downstream of the Yangtze River. Other important ports in Jiangsu, such as Wuxi, Suzhou, and Changshu, have also established branch offices to handle the tax collection for ships transporting goods. It is claimed that the purpose of this measure is to regulate the large quantities of goods transported inland by waterways and points out the importance of Hupukou's commercial position. Personnel from the new tax collection office of the puppet "Central China Government" in Hupukou embezzled more than 20,000 yuan of public funds last month and fled, leading the Japanese side to take responsibility for handling import goods tax collection starting next week. As for the export goods tax in the Yangtze River area, it has been enforced by the puppet "Central China Government" since October of last year.</p>
<h3>British Community Decides to Establish the "British Relief for China Fund"</h3>
<p>Since the Mayor of London initiated the organization of the China Relief Fund Committee, British people have enthusiastically donated and contributed a significant amount of medicines for Chinese refugees. The committee previously received a report from Mr. Williamson, Chairman of the Shandong Relief Committee, stating that due to the Chinese war, there are currently over ten million refugees in dire need of assistance. The committee immediately telegraphed the British Relief Committee in China for a detailed investigation to determine a relief plan, and held a joint relief conference in Shanghai on January 29th, which concluded on the 31st. According to sources, the joint conference resolved to establish the "British Relief for China Fund Chinese Headquarters" in Kunming, with Mr. Davidson, the British Consul-General in Kunming, as Chairman. A branch will also be established in Chongqing to be responsible for planning relief matters. All other decisions regarding relief work have been made. All necessary expenses and relief funds will be the responsibility of the London headquarters, which will remit them to Yunnan and Chongqing on a regular basis. The first meeting in Yunnan is scheduled for the end of February. At the joint conference, representatives from various regions provided detailed reports on the refugee situation. For example, a flood in northern Jiangsu Province has left refugees displaced and homeless, and local priests are trying to provide relief. Throughout China, there are continuous large-scale bombings, causing many civilian casualties in urban areas. The situation is extremely tragic, and the number of refugees is increasing daily, requiring urgent relief efforts. The headquarters originally intended to be established in Shanghai, but for the convenience of work, it was decided to relocate to Kunming.</p>
<h3>Spurious Legal Tender Discovered; Inferior Paper Makes It Easily Identifiable</h3>
<p>Following the Ministry of Finance's regulations on suppressing Japanese and puppet banknotes, banking circles reported yesterday that while some spurious legal tender has been discovered in the market, the amount is very small. The paper is of very poor quality, and the watermark is in a different position, making it quite easy to identify. A certain bank discovered someone attempting to exchange spurious legal tender at the bank and detected it. Because the person holding the spurious note proved to be a legitimate merchant, the bank only stamped the counterfeit note with a "fake note" chop to invalidate it, without pursuing the matter further.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Searches for Thugs; 144 Arrested; Police Force Proven Effective</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that intelligence obtained last night (the 10th) reveals that detectives from the Public Concession Police Department have intensified their efforts to investigate armed crime. In the first nine days of this month, they have arrested no fewer than 144 Chinese individuals associated with armed thugs and seized 19 handguns. This operation is being conducted through the cooperation of detectives from the nine police stations. Detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station are shouldering the majority of the responsibility, having arrested no fewer than 43 armed bandits in their district since the beginning of this month. The Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested 41 individuals, and the Hongkou West District Police Station arrested 21. The Criminal Division of the Central Police Station arrested 17, and the Lao Zha Police Station arrested an average of one thug per day. The Putu Road Police Station arrested five thugs, and the Yangshupu Police Station, north of the Suzhou Creek, also participated in the crackdown, arresting three individuals. Detectives from the Xinzha Police Station also apprehended three individuals, and the Yulin Road Police Station arrested two. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the police force. In light of recent criticisms in Japanese newspapers regarding the Police Department, denouncing it as poorly organized, this record is of great significance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Xinchang Town, Pudong, Suffer Losses and Retreat; Japanese Troops Busily Redeployed and Exhausted; Chinese Troops Seize the Opportunity to Advance and Directly Threaten Zhoupu</h3>
<p>In Shangnan and Shangchuan, Pudong, the Japanese military's stronghold lines are in a precarious situation. In the past five days, due to the activities of guerrillas taking advantage of the situation, the Japanese have been fully exposed to the suffering of running back and forth and being exhausted, making it difficult to cope. In Shangchuan, the Japanese military's Zhihong unit has been largely emptied, and the Chinese army has</p>
<p>grasped its weaknesses, launching assaults on various military stations along the Shangchuan Road for several nights in a row, inflicting heavy casualties. The Japanese army, with only a hundred or so experienced soldiers, was unable to hold out and urgently requested reinforcements from the Ogawa unit in Shangnan. On the morning of the 9th, they sent over 200 soldiers to reinforce the Shangchuan line and launched an offensive from Chuancheng to the south, directly attacking Zhuqiao in an attempt to relieve the crisis in Chuancheng. The Chinese army, seeing that the Japanese forces in Shangchuan were heavily concentrated and relatively strong, abandoned their offensive on this route and turned to Shangnan,</p>
<p>turning defense into offense. The day before yesterday (the 9th) in the afternoon, another fierce engagement occurred in Xinchang Town in the 7th district of Nanhui. The Japanese troops on this route, originally advancing from Zhoupu, initially had a force of over 300 soldiers (including 200 new recruits), hoping to harass the Nanhui county seat from Xinchang. Unexpectedly, over 200 soldiers were diverted to reinforce Chuansha, leaving only over 100 soldiers in Shangnan, who were surrounded by the Chinese army in Xinchang and</p>
<p>found themselves in bitter fighting. From the afternoon of the 9th, the battle continued into the night, with the sound of artillery fire rumbling incessantly. Both sides used close-range machine-gun fire. The Chinese army initially adopted a defensive posture, but after learning that two-thirds of the Japanese forces had been diverted, they took advantage of their weakness and launched a fierce counterattack. After a half-day and night of fighting, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses yesterday morning and retreated to their original stronghold in Zhoupu. The Chinese army is pursuing their victory and has a momentum that directly threatens Zhoupu. Yesterday, the Japanese military on the Shangnan front</p>
<p>found themselves in a tense situation. The Ogawa unit again requested the return of the over 200 reinforcements that had been sent to the Zhihong unit in Chuansha on the morning of the 9th. This unit had been extremely frustrated after their unsuccessful attacks in Chuansha and Zhuqiao. Yesterday, they were ordered to return to Shangnan and at 2:00 PM, they boarded the Shangchuan train and arrived at Gaomiao Town along the Pu River at 4:00 PM, where they boarded two small steamers to Nanhuangpu to reinforce the Shangnan line. Running back and forth, they are exhausted and lack the will to fight. Therefore, although they were able to hold their stronghold after returning to Zhoupu, they lack the strength to launch another offensive.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul-General Visits Concession Authorities; Requests the Suppression of Terrorists; No Mention of Shooting Incidents in Japanese-Controlled Areas; Japanese Newspapers Continue Malicious Attacks</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that in the wake of repeated terrorist incidents in western Shanghai, Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura Yoshiaki, accompanied by a Japanese consul, visited the authorities of the two concessions on Friday, making an oral request to "exert pressure to curb the activities of terrorists in the two concessions." Miura first visited Mr. Fessenden and General MacNaghten, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Municipal Council, stating that the Japanese authorities wished to see the Public Concession maintain its peace and order. They then exchanged views on recent terrorist incidents and how to deal with them. However, Japanese sources did not mention the repeated shooting incidents occurring in the Japanese-controlled areas such as Jessfield Road. Miura then visited French Consul-General Baudoin, making the same request regarding peace and order in the French Concession, although there have been no assassinations or political killings in the French Concession for some time. It is reported that Japanese newspapers have recently made malicious attacks on the Police Department, claiming that it is powerless and that the Police Department's attempt to control assassinations is "hypocritical." However, the Japanese newspapers have not said a word about the Japanese authorities' refusal to cooperate with the Police Department, such as the failure to hand over the captured bandits in Fahuazhen, resulting in the escape of four. It is not mentioned in the Japanese sources whether this matter was discussed during Miura's visit to the Concession authorities.</p>
<h3>Various Places Encourage Female Workers to Go to Sichuan; Develop the Southwest and Increase Production</h3>
<p>Since the National Army's westward withdrawal, factories have been developing in the southwest. The government authorities have formulated measures to settle female workers entering Sichuan, sending notices to various provinces and cities to handle the matter. The Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday ordered the governments of Chuansha, Nanhui, and other counties to encourage female workers to enter Sichuan. The measures are as follows: Female workers who are familiar with the work of cotton mills must be forced to work in factories. Female workers who have been introduced to work will still be provided with accommodation. Those who cannot be settled in work will still be provided with food and accommodation. Negotiate with clothing factories for clothing materials, which will be taken out and made by female workers. Sewing machines will be rented by the New Transport General Association, and the rent will be deducted from wages. Shenxin Cotton Mill needs 100 female workers, and the labor leader will register them. Those who have relatives to help or seek their own way will be allowed to do so. Funds will be temporarily requisitioned from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The number of female workers who have or do not have work will be notified by the New Transport General Association to various agencies at any time for investigation.</p>

<h3>French Mail Steamer "Athos" Collides with "Izumo"; Caused by High Waves and Difficulty in Turning; One Floating Pier Sinks; Minor Damage to French Mail Steamer</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that the French mail steamer Athos II collided with the Japanese flagship Izumo near the Garden Bridge yesterday afternoon (the 10th) while attempting to turn around, sinking the Japanese mail shipping company's Hongkou pier's central floating pier. It also caused significant damage to the superstructure of the tugboat Caroline Moller, which was docked nearby downstream. The Athos suffered only minor damage itself. From the outside, it appears that only</p>
<p>some of the white paint on the hull was scraped off. The captain of the ship told reporters last night that the various parts of the ship that collided with the pier and tugboat are currently being inspected in detail. The ship's personnel claimed that the unfortunate incident was entirely due to the wind and rapid current. The Athos arrived from Wusong yesterday afternoon, and the pilot, as usual,</p>
<p>attempted to turn around before mooring at the Gonghexiang pier. Before the turn was completed, it collided with the Izumo, which was docked next to the mail pier. Fortunately, the collision was minor, only scraping off part of the golden chrysanthemum decorating the bow of the Izumo. A few minutes later, the middle floating pier of the pier was hit hard, causing it to begin to sink. The French mail steamer then collided with the bow of the tugboat Caroline Moller,</p>
<p>causing significant damage. As for whether there was any other damage to the tugboat, it was not known for sure last night because another Moller tugboat was docked next to the Caroline, obstructing the view. The Athos eventually docked at its intended pier. When the ship was investigated, the blame was placed on the wind and strong river current. When reporters asked Captain Boyer last night, he admitted that the accident was related to the wind and strong river current, but said there were other reasons that he could not elaborate on until</p>
<p>he reported to the authorities. After the Athos incident, it did not remain in Shanghai but will set sail according to its original schedule. According to well-informed sources, if there is any minor damage to the ship, it will be repaired before leaving Shanghai. The Water Police and port officials are currently investigating the cause of the accident, but no details have been released as of late last night.</p>

<h3>Locally Produced Cotton Cannot Be Shipped to Shanghai; Chinese Factories Order Foreign Cotton; Approximately 300,000 Bales Ordered and Shipped to Shanghai in Batches; Market Demand Exceeds Supply; Factories Make Huge Profits</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese government banned the shipping of cotton to Shanghai, and cotton in the war zone is controlled by the Japanese puppets, Chinese-owned yarn factories in the Shanghai concession area have been forced to order 300,000 bales of foreign cotton, which have been shipped to Shanghai in batches for use in spinning cotton yarn. Yarn factories have experienced abnormal growth since the war and have made huge profits last year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Locally Produced Cotton Cannot Be Shipped to Shanghai; The cotton industry has always been concentrated in Shanghai because Shanghai is the largest consumer of cotton and the largest trading market. After the war, the Chinese government prohibited the shipping and sale of cotton to Shanghai after Shanghai fell, so that cotton produced in Shaanxi, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, and other provinces could not be shipped to Shanghai. Cotton from Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in the war zone was greatly reduced due to the influence of Japanese puppet control. Exports to Japan and the Kwantung Leased Territory in Korea and Taiwan increased sharply. Last year, it reached 1,217,471 metric tons, valued at 89,896,717 national currency yuan.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Order Foreign Cotton to Adjust; The Chinese-owned yarn factories in the Shanghai concession area are reducing the shipping of cotton to Shanghai in various places, so that there is a risk of lack of textile raw materials. They have no choice but to order foreign cotton from Brazil, India, Egypt, the United States, and other places. According to the "New Voice News Agency" reporter's exploration of the yarn industry yesterday, a total of 300,000 bales of foreign cotton have been ordered and shipped to Shanghai in batches, and it is expected that they will all arrive before the end of May. It is for use in spinning yarn in various yarn factories. 50,000 bales have already been shipped to Shanghai from Brazil and India, and Brazilian cotton is the most popular.</p>
<p>Chinese-Owned Yarn Factories Make Huge Profits; The Chinese-owned yarn factories within the concession are Shenxin No. 2 and No. 9, Xinyu No. 1 and No. 2, Hongzhang, Yong'an No. 3, Tongyi, Qinfeng, Datong, Heji Zhenye and other ten companies, with 385,632 spindles and 1,700 looms. After the war, production was reduced due to the destruction of yarn factories in the war zone, while the demand for yarn in the interior was high, resulting in soaring prices for Chinese yarn. The market supply fell short of demand, and each factory made a profit last year, ranging from one million to ten million, especially Shenxin and Xinyu.</p>
<p>Shanghai Yarn Factories Have the Most Japanese Companies; Foreign-owned yarn factories in Shanghai include four British-owned companies, Jardine Matheson, Public Welfare, Yangshupu, and Lunchang, with 44,616 spindles and 3,265 looms. There are 24 Japanese-owned companies, including Rihua, Shanghai, NeiWai, Tongxing, Gongda, Dakang, Toyota, Yufeng, and Donghua, with 1,324,140 spindles and 14,554 looms. British yarn is entirely for use in British factories for weaving, and Japanese yarn is dumped in the war zone and for use in various Chinese and foreign cotton weaving factories in Shanghai. Although profits were high last year, they were less than those of Chinese factories.</p>
<p>Transactions Increase Daily, Prices Gradually Rise; Yarn sales in Shanghai were very sluggish for several months after the outbreak of the war. Only 3,230 bales were traded in September of the year before last. Later, as transportation along the coast and inland slightly eased, various weaving factories in Shanghai resumed operations. Therefore, as consumption increased, transactions increased daily. 20,900 bales were traded in June last year, and 20,083 bales were traded in November. The sales areas were mostly inland, such as Guangdong, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and among peers. The price of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn was 288 yuan in July of the year before last and has now risen to 403 yuan.</p>
<h3>Min Opera to Help Refugees</h3>
<p>The Fujian-based Sanshan Minyue Amateur Opera Troupe in Shanghai has been organized for many years and has performed three times, with remarkable results. It is especially welcomed by the Min people in Shanghai. Recognizing the suffering of the refugees in Shanghai and doing their best to help, they have been specially organized by gentry and merchants Chen Shaohua, Shen Xiaoxiang, He Fosen, Lin Jiamao, Zheng Benheng, Huang Youqing, Ye Darong, Yang Lizhu, Zhao Yuanguan, Huang Fengying, and other gentlemen to organize a preparatory committee. It is scheduled to perform at the Carlton Theatre at 6:00 PM on the 14th of this month. Seat tickets are numbered and priced at one yuan, two yuan, and three yuan. They are sold by various Min shops. The ticket proceeds will be allocated by the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to help refugees. The repertoire includes "Fan Saijiao," "Su Mei Sells Paintings," and "The Three Beauties' Strange Fate," all of which are very distinctive. The scenery is also excellent. It is expected that the Min people will enthusiastically attend.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Announces Vessel Navigation Restriction Rules. Approved Steamers Must Pay Public Welfare Fees Based on Tonnage. Passenger Ships Must Be Over 500 Tons.</h3>
<p>In order to improve the water transport system, the Zhejiang Provincial Government decided to establish a maritime affairs management agency. After deliberation at a provincial government meeting, it was decided that transport vessels approved to operate in accordance with the Zhejiang Eastern Navigation Regulations would be charged a public welfare fee based on net tonnage. Coastal port vessel navigation restriction rules were established and issued to the Ningbo and Wenzhou-Taizhou defense commanders for compliance. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Vessel Navigation Restriction Rules: Zhejiang Province Coastal Port Vessel Navigation Restriction Rules, Article 1: All vessels permitted to navigate in Zhejiang Province ports in accordance with the temporary regulations for navigation in various ports along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang and the south bank of the Qiantang River (hereinafter referred to as the "Temporary Navigation Regulations") shall comply with these rules. Article 2: When applying for a passage permit in accordance with Article 3 of the Temporary Navigation Regulations, each vessel must first declare its willingness to comply with all the provisions of these rules. If it carries passengers, its tonnage must be 500 tons or more, but this restriction does not apply to vessels traveling between small ports within the province. Article 3: Each approved vessel is permitted to operate on one of the following routes and is not allowed to operate on multiple routes simultaneously. However, with special permission, routes (C), (D), and (E) may include one or two additional ports. When changing routes, a new application for a passage permit must be submitted. A. Between ports outside the province and Ningbo. B. Between ports outside the province and Haimen. C. Between ports outside the province and Wenzhou. D. Between ports outside the province and Ruian. E. Between ports outside the province and Pingyang. Article 4: Vessels with approved passage permits must pay a public welfare fee when navigating on the approved route. For each outbound trip, the fee is one yuan per net ton. For each inbound trip, the fee is two yuan per net ton. Article 5: Vessels that violate the provisions of these rules shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Temporary Navigation Regulations. Article 6: After the implementation of these rules, all fees previously collected by various localities based on the tonnage of inbound and outbound vessels shall be discontinued. Article 7: Vessels are not allowed to carry contraband items privately. The entry and exit of all passengers and goods shall be subject to inspection. Inspection rules will be established separately. If inspectors engage in extortion or harassment, merchants are allowed to report it directly at any time. Once verified, they will be severely punished. Article 8: These rules shall be implemented after deliberation and promulgation by the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Headquarters Explains Permit Application Procedures: The Tenth Army Group Headquarters provides the following explanation regarding Article 7 of the Temporary Navigation Regulations for Zhejiang Eastern Navigation, concerning the procedures for obtaining passage permits for independent professions such as lawyers, journalists, teachers, and doctors: Lawyers, doctors, teachers, and journalists all have identifiable statuses and cannot be clearly identified without valid credentials. Even litigants have subpoenas that can be verified. If there are no other circumstances, passage may be granted. Anyone in a profession that can be exempted from military service who must travel to Wenzhou, Taizhou, Shanghai, or other ports must provide legitimate proof to be allowed to exit. Regarding the evacuation of civilians from the rear of the war zone and the return of dispersed personnel from various agencies to their hometowns, evacuation of people is only permitted to safe areas in the rear. There is no reason to move in the direction of the Japanese. Anyone doing so is either a traitor or an enemy sympathizer and should be subject to the restrictions of Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Navigation Regulations. Dispersed personnel all have documentation from their respective agencies, such as letters of appointment, which are easily identifiable. Regarding men under the age of sixteen or over the age of forty-five, and women, exiting the area, the original regulations should still be followed strictly, as these regulations were originally intended to prevent desertion, and whether or not someone is of the appropriate age cannot be determined subjectively. Furthermore, the exit of these people can largely be encompassed by the people referred to in the first, second, and third items. It is unlikely that they would be exiting for no reason. Foreign nationals are only checked for suspicion of communicating with the Japanese and are not subject to restrictions. The above five items have been telegraphed to the Ningbo and Wenzhou-Taizhou defense commanders for compliance.</p>
<h3>Refusal to Increase Employment of Japanese Customs Officers. Japanese Pressure on Customs Fails. Customs States Inability to Accept Demands. Japanese Attempt to Exert Pressure Apparently Thwarted Again.</h3>
<p>The Japanese side, in an attempt to undermine the entire administrative system of the Jianghai Customs, has spared no effort in applying various forms of pressure. Recently, they made an illegal representation to the British Deputy Commissioner of Customs, Mr. Rocher, demanding the increased employment of senior Japanese customs officers and seventy ordinary Japanese customs officers, in order to increase Japanese pressure and restrain customs administrative matters. It is understood that, after repeated consultations with the Inspector General of Customs by Mr. Rocher, it was deemed that the Japanese move was unjustified and that the customs authorities found it difficult to deal with. Therefore, the Japanese side has now been informed that all requests are completely rejected and cannot be accepted. The Japanese plot to put pressure on the customs has now failed.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Compatriots Perform Theater to Raise Funds. Feng Bingnan Explains the Significance. Helping Fellow Refugees is a Shared Good Deed. Everyone Fulfills Their Obligations, Converging on the Same Goal.</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Compatriots Association, concerned about the serious plight of refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, seized the opportunity of the Taishan Male and Female Theater Troupe's visit to Shanghai to launch a theatrical performance to raise funds for disaster relief. The situation was enthusiastic and the scale was grand. A committee for theatrical performance fundraising for refugee relief was formed, and Mr. Feng Bingnan was elected as the chairman, with Mr. Guo Shun and Mr. Guo Shenliang as the vice-chairmen. Mr. Feng gave a speech explaining the significance of this theatrical performance fundraising, which is recorded as follows: The Guangdong Compatriots Association in Shanghai is currently raising funds to help refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, and to subsidize the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. The Taishan Male and Female Cantonese Opera Troupe has come to Shanghai to perform, and upon hearing the news, they spontaneously proposed to perform for our association without remuneration, to assist in this charitable cause. Their enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable. The Guangdong Compatriots Association in Shanghai has specially formed this association to expand this undertaking and is honored to have mistakenly elected me, Mr. Guo Shun, and Mr. Guo Zhongliang as the chairman and vice-chairmen of this association. Mr. Guo Shun and Mr. Guo Zhongliang are energetic and capable and will certainly be able to fulfill their duties happily. I have been ill for many years, staying at home to recuperate. My virtue is insufficient, and my body is weak. I am not capable of rushing about and exerting myself, nor can I effectively direct and command. Since I was born, I have always been willing to do my part in public welfare undertakings to the best of my ability, and I have never wanted to be behind others, nor do I want to occupy any title. However, today's matter is as urgent as saving someone from drowning. There is no time for ceremony and modesty, lest we fall into injustice. Moreover, my fellow countrymen are calling out for help everywhere, rescuing those in danger and providing disaster relief. Responses are coming from all directions. How can I refuse this title and not bear its weight? I can only offer my humble heart and strive to follow along. I think of the refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, struggling in dire straits. The newspapers in Shanghai have occasionally reported on their plight and suffering. However, what those who have recently come to Shanghai from Guangdong and Guangxi have described and witnessed is beyond the power of pen and ink to describe, and even beyond the imagination of the mind. In short, the fields are full of wailing, and people are emaciated and covered in mud, urgently awaiting rescue. The sooner we raise funds, the more days they can live. The more people who donate, the more people can be saved. At the beginning of the war, Shanghai was the first to be affected. At that time, there was still much territory in our country intact, and it was easier to raise donations. Now, however, the flames of war are raging everywhere, and the disaster area is expanding. Everyone is struggling to save themselves, and begging for help is useless. Only the Shanghai Special Zone, with its abnormal commercial development last year, is still a relatively complete place. Therefore, the refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi cannot but hope that their compatriots in Shanghai will do their best to raise funds. This is the first reason. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been supporting refugees in Shanghai for many years, exhausting its heart and energy. While we are appealing on behalf of our hometown, we must also think of those who share the same difficulties. Therefore, we also plan to take this opportunity to share our resources and show our sympathy. This is the second reason. While the Guangdong Compatriots Association in Shanghai was considering and deliberating, the Taishan Theater Troupe suddenly arrived and expressed their support, planning this charitable performance. Their enthusiasm and determination are not only a great help to our association, but also inspire the members of our association and make them more energetic. All the performers in the troupe are using their superb artistic skills to represent our appeal. Their compassion is already moving. Ms. Li Xuefang, who has long retired from the stage, is motivated by public duty and is willing to reappear and perform again. This is rare among the rare. Ms. Li has been hailed as the "Fairy of Ten Songs" and her reputation is comparable to that of Dr. Mei Lanfang and Dr. Cheng Yanqiu. Since she retired from the stage, her performances have been lost. Now, on the red carpet, we can see her beautiful figure again, giving the people of Shanghai a new experience. It can be said to be a rare exception in the midst of national crisis. Since the performers are so aware of the importance of the cause, we must also actively promote it in order to fulfill our duty. However, the national crisis is deep, and we dare not easily speak of entertainment. Why use entertainment as a means of raising funds? In my opinion, although drama is a type of entertainment, it depends on the motive behind it. If it is entertainment for charity, then there must be thoughts of inspiring and moving the crowd during the singing and dancing. If it is charity through entertainment, then there must be more painful and generous songs after the return of the wind and snow. Now, the purpose of our association's theatrical performance is purely for good. Therefore, its joy is not comparable to entertainment. As the saying goes, "Doing good is the greatest joy." The joy of doing good always gives people an indescribable comfort in their limbs and bones. For example, when we do something that is right and just, we always feel that the white clouds in the sky and the flowing water in the mountains are joyful and leisurely, with a kind of tranquility and ease. Most of the philanthropists in Shanghai are always eager to contribute to public welfare undertakings. I know that they must have all tasted this greatest joy in the world. Therefore, we know that the purpose of this association's decision to perform is to allow the audience to enjoy the joy of doing good, rather than the joy of wonderful dances and happy songs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the purpose of this association's theatrical performance is, of course, to help refugees, to show the meaning of sharing goodness with others. Its side effect is to express a warm response to the kindness of the Taishan Theater Troupe and all the performers, as well as Mrs. Wei Li Xuefang, and to show the superb art of the performers, so that people know that art is a product of emotion, and is by no means a tool for pleasing and pleasing the senses as ordinary people think. Those who feel the same as me are many, so I say that the performers and the audience will not use this move as a function of entertaining the mind and body, but all seek to do their duty to achieve the goal of doing good for the most pleasure. It may be said that the organization of this charitable event is a good thing that achieves three goals, as far as the association, the Taishan Theater Troupe, and the audience are concerned, although the gains are different, the joy is the same. The association has three gains: 1. Promote the original intention of doing good. 2. Enable the Taishan Theater Troupe to achieve its aspirations for doing good. 3. Allow the audience to enjoy the ultimate joy of doing good. The Taishan Theater Troupe and Mrs. Wei Li Xuefang also have three gains: 1. Help this association raise funds so that it can cultivate its strength for doing good. 2. Create more opportunities for the audience to do good. 3. Enable the performers to fulfill their aspirations to help refugees as much as possible. On the audience side, there are also three gains: 1. Help this association raise funds to achieve the goal of doing good thoroughly. 2. Enable the performers to achieve their common aspirations for doing good. 3. Allow themselves to have more opportunities to do good. Therefore, I deeply believe that this theatrical performance fundraising is by no means ordinary entertainment, but a duty that should be fulfilled in the national crisis. Not only do the members of this association hold this idea, but the performers and the audience must also share this concept. However, members of this association, such as the chairman and vice-chairmen Guo Shun and Guo Zhongliang, and Mr. Li Ze, Cui Pinxi, Jiang Hechun, Chen Qifen, Chen Qihao, Liang Haichou, Liang Weisi, He Quansheng, and Guo Qiming, have been rushing about day and night. As for myself, I have been ill for a long time and have not been able to follow my colleagues, which is deeply regrettable. The male and female performers of the Taishan Theater Troupe, Gui Mingyang, Luo Jiaquan, Wen Huamei, etc., as well as Mrs. Wei Li Xuefang, have also worked hard to assist in creating this situation in a short period of time. Their strength is truly astonishing. Today, I cannot help but express my gratitude and joy. In addition to my own admiration and gratitude, I must represent the members of this association, the fellow countrymen, the refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, and the refugees in Shanghai, to express my deep gratitude, and to express my advance welcome and gratitude to the audience, and to hope that both fellow countrymen and non-fellow countrymen will actively participate to fulfill their duties in the national crisis, to promote this good deed, and to share the greatest joy. I cannot express my great wish enough.</p>
<h3>There Are 200,000 Guerrillas in Japanese-Occupied Areas. Japanese Spokesman Admits Without Hesitation.</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that at a reception for reporters held by the Japanese side last night (the 10th), a reporter asked a question after the Japanese military spokesman announced that the Japanese army was fighting with guerrillas. The spokesman replied that there were 200,000 guerrillas fighting in the Japanese-occupied areas. The spokesman further replied that the Japanese army in China was currently fully engaged in "mopping-up operations."</p>
<h3>A Terrible Smallpox Epidemic Is Spreading in Tokyo. Members of Parliament and the Imperial Family Are Wary. It Is Even Claimed That the Smallpox Bacteria Were Brought from Shanghai.</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that yesterday (the 10th) the Japanese-language Continental New News carried a Tokyo dispatch stating that more than 100 cases of a terrible smallpox epidemic had occurred in Tokyo last month, compared to only 60 cases in the entire year of last year. Four cases have recently occurred near the Tokyo Parliament building, so members of parliament and others are also wary and are being vaccinated against smallpox to prevent infection. Moreover, because the Imperial Palace is close to the Parliament, special preventive measures are being taken. Princes and their families of the Imperial Family, as well as personnel of the High Court, are also being vaccinated. Three thousand people, including the Minister of the Imperial Household, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, and other personnel of the Imperial Household Ministry, were specially ordered to be vaccinated last Tuesday. Officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs say that the current smallpox epidemic was transmitted from Shanghai, as Japanese travelers brought the bacteria back with them from Shanghai. Travelers returning from "Manchukuo" have not been found to have contracted the disease.</p>

<h3>Dancer Sues Pawnshop Owner, Seeking Contract Fulfillment, Demanding Compensation for Living Expenses. Defendant's Lawyer Files Counterclaim, Requesting Cancellation of Illegal Contract.</h3>
<p>Zheng Mengyuan, a Chaozhou native and owner of Taihe Pawnshop on Rue Albert, French Concession, possesses assets worth five to six million gold. His son, Zheng Zuoxuan, 21 years old this year, frequented dance halls three years ago, resulting in cohabitation with Wu Xi dancer Zhang Xiuying (19 years old this year, residing at No. 4, Lane 42, Route Doumer). Zhang has now retained a lawyer to file a suit in the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court against Zheng Zuoxuan, seeking</p>
<p>Fulfillment of Contract. According to the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff and defendant met through an introduction in 1935. The defendant was immediately captivated and claimed to be unmarried, expressing a desire to marry the plaintiff. At that time, the plaintiff's will was weak and she was persuaded, and they cohabited at No. 76 Jing'an Villa. On August 18, 1938, the defendant himself</p>
<p>Invited a Lawyer to be Present and entered into a contract with the plaintiff, stipulating that they would marry by September 22 of the same year. If there were any violations, the defendant would willingly compensate the plaintiff with 50,000 yuan for living expenses. When the deadline arrived, the defendant failed to fulfill the marriage contract and, upon being questioned, claimed that his parents had arranged another marriage for him, so he could not fulfill the contract. He stated that he would pay the promised compensation in installments. Unexpectedly, the defendant neither fulfilled the marriage contract nor paid the promised compensation. However, the defendant is a</p>
<p>Son of a Wealthy Family and spends thousands upon thousands on daily expenses outside. The court is requested to recover the stipulated amount. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Wu Xiaoge, summoned both parties to Courtroom 7 of the Civil Division for a hearing at 3:00 PM yesterday. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyer first stated the circumstances, and the defendant's lawyer, Sun Zuji, replied and filed a counterclaim,</p>
<p>Requesting Dismissal of the Plaintiff's Suit and Cancellation of the contract signed by both parties on August 18 and October 3, 1938. It was stated that the plaintiff was originally a dancer, and under the instigation of her mother, the defendant, who had just left school and was inexperienced, was unduly seduced and forced to sign this contract, which was illegal and should be dismissed and the contract canceled. After the lawyers for both parties argued their respective cases, the court found that the case required further investigation and adjourned the hearing to a later date, and the court was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Kill Puppet Officers in Beixinjing, One Dead, One Escaped, One Abducted. Japanese Soldiers Search for Traces Without Success.</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At around 10:00 AM yesterday, three rickshaws were traveling on the Beixinjing Avenue in northwestern Shanghai, with one person sitting upright in each rickshaw. Each rickshaw's footboard had a large package of salt. As they approached Zhoujiaqiao, six burly men claiming to be guerrillas, armed with Mauser pistols, suddenly jumped out from the roadside, intercepted the three rickshaws, searched them, and interrogated the passenger in the first rickshaw. The passenger was about to reply that he was a salted pork merchant when the two passengers in the second and third rickshaws at the rear claimed to the guerrillas that they were inspectors from the Zhoujiaqiao branch of the Salt Bureau and that the salt on the rickshaws had just been intercepted from the Beixinjing area. As they spoke, they presented their badges. After the guerrillas inspected them, they realized that they were puppet officers from the puppet organization and immediately opened fire. One of them was hit twice and died on the spot. One escaped into a rice store and survived. Another was abducted without a trace. Afterwards, someone reported the incident to the Japanese military police headquarters, who first transported the deceased away and searched the nearby area, but there was no trace of the abducted person. It was later learned that the deceased was named Li Deqing, from Changshu, and the abducted person was named Chen Yuquan, from Huzhou.</p>
<p>Another report states that at around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 10th), three impoverished old women were carrying 20-30 catties of salt on their shoulders, selling it along the street in Beixinjing Town in northwestern Shanghai. Suddenly, three puppet tax police from the puppet "Municipal Government" came forward, seized the three old women, and, along with the salt, sent them to the puppet self-government association in the town for interrogation. Later, the guerrillas in the town learned of this and rushed to the rescue. As they walked to the Shiqiao pier on Dongda Street, they caught sight of the three puppet tax police approaching. The guerrillas immediately drew their pistols and fired at the puppet police, killing one of them on the spot, who fell into a pool of blood on the riverside west of the stone bridge. The other two escaped. The deceased was identified as Li Debiao, 28 years old, from Anhui, with a bamboo cloth armband on his arm, which read "Tax Police Second Team, Dadao Municipal Government." It is now reported that Wang Ao, the "chairman" of the town's "self-government association," and Pan Langhuan, Hou Zhuying, and Qin, the "vice-chairmen," were detained by Japanese soldiers yesterday and sent to the Japanese military police headquarters on Lincoln Road for questioning.</p>
<h3>Former Clerk of Exchange Trust Office Embezzles Public Funds, Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison.</h3>
<p>Huang Qixian, from Haimen, served as an old clerk at the Jiuyou Shanghai-Chang Exchange Trust Office in Room 711, Continental Building, 9 Jiangxi Road. At 1:00 PM on the 25th of last month, he was ordered by manager Ma Yunxiang to go to Yusheng Exchange on 30 Tianjin Road to collect a check for 3,000 yuan from Jin Cheng Bank, and instructed to deposit the check in the Continental Bank. Huang did not comply, but after obtaining the check, he cashed it and absconded without a trace. Jiuyou reported the incident to the police, requesting an arrest warrant. It was not until the day before yesterday that Chief Detective Yang Peisheng and Detective Zhou Zhenxing of the General Police Department arrested Huang at No. 14 Zhicheng Lane, Gallic Road, and seized the original stolen goods of 2,602 yuan. They took him back to the police station. Under interrogation, Huang fully confessed and said that the remaining money had been lost at the Liyuan gambling den on Jiaozhou Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special No. 1 Court, and police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him under Article 336 of the Criminal Code. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, Huang was sentenced to eight months in prison as a warning, and the stolen goods were returned to the owner.</p>
<h3>Members of the Puppet "Self-Defense Corps" Released by the Court, But Taken Away by Someone.</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, at around 9:00 PM, the search team of the Lao Zha Police Department seized three people, Wu Tianbao from Zhejiang, Li Jishan from Yangzhou, and Lu Jiabao from Shanghai, near the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road. Two Mauser pistols, one handgun, and 27 bullets were seized. It was found that Wu and the others were planning to join the "Self-Defense Corps" organized by the puppet "Municipal Government" and were sent to the Special No. 1 Court with a request for detention for investigation into whether they had committed any crimes within the Concession, as reported in this newspaper. Now that the police have determined that Wu and the others have not committed any crimes within the Concession, the police have applied to the Special No. 1 Court for the withdrawal of the detention of Wu and the others. The Special Court has approved the release. However, it is reported that after Wu and the others were released from the police station, they were taken away by someone. What the result was is unknown.</p>
<h3>Loss of Both Life and Property, Account Clerk Hangs Himself. Corpse Claimed for Burial by the Owner of the Paili Company.</h3>
<p>Gu Chongyao, a native of Daozhen, Huzhou, 37 years old this year, was an accountant at Paili Native Products Company at No. 491 Avenue Joffre. Gu had married two wives, who both died of illness. Each wife had a child. Gu's parents were deceased, and he was a businessman working outside. Since there was</p>
<p>No One to Care for them at Home, the two children were fostered with an aunt from the same clan. He would return every two or three months to visit them. When the war broke out, Gu's hometown was devastated, but fortunately his house was still standing. Recently, Gu took leave to return to his hometown to see his children. Unexpectedly, because guerrillas were attacking the Japanese army in the countryside, the Japanese army became enraged and set fire to all the villages and houses where Gu lived, and the two children and their aunt were also missing.</p>
<p>Their Fate Unknown. In addition, Gu had 800 yuan in cash deposited in a money house in Wuzhen. Unexpectedly, the money house also closed down due to the war, and all the deposits were lost. Gu suffered a series of blows and became mentally unstable after returning to Shanghai, feeling that life was no longer interesting, resulting in a short-sighted act.

<p>Hanged Himself with a Belt, following his parents and two wives to the underworld. At 10:00 PM that night, Xiang Daquan (25 years old, from Haimen), a clerk from the Paili Native Products Company, returned to the dormitory to sleep and discovered it upon entering the room. He immediately called the second landlord, Chen Lu (39 years old, from Zhenjiang), and neighbors to rescue him, but it was too late, and he had already died. He then reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy.</p>

<h3>Coal Briquette Factory Owner Assassinated: Two Shots Followed by Ax Blows</h3>
<p>Luo Yi, a 38-year-old man from Shaoxing, residing at No. 1, Lu Jia Lane, Rue Massenet, in the French Concession, owned the Jiangnan Coal Briquette Factory at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Changping Road in Western Shanghai. Due to the high demand in society, the business was very prosperous. Yesterday around noon, Luo was taking a rickshaw from his home to the factory to handle business matters. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw reached the entrance of the He Yu Electroplating Factory near the intersection of Changping Road, three men, who had been lying in wait, suddenly jumped out from the roadside and blocked Luo's path. One of the three men held a pistol, while the other two wielded sharp axes. The man with the pistol immediately fired two shots at Luo. The bullets hit Luo's left shoulder and exited through his waist, causing him to immediately collapse to the ground. The ax-wielding men rushed forward and violently hacked Luo's head five times, causing blood to splatter everywhere and Luo to be on the verge of death, barely breathing. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the three assailants immediately fled in separate directions without a trace. By the time the patrol officers arrived, it was already too late to pursue them. They summoned a vehicle to take the injured man to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, his life was in critical danger. At the same time, the police are thoroughly investigating the case and are strictly pursuing the murderers. The motive for the attack is still difficult to ascertain.</p>
<p>Gatekeeper Stabbed: Tong Jinshou, a 44-year-old man from Xuzhou, residing at No. 222, Lane 33, South Chengdu Road, worked as a gatekeeper at Fumin Village, Rue Foochow, in the Public Concession (Badge No. 1698). Yesterday at 3:30 AM, while Zhou was on duty in the lane, two people suddenly approached him and asked to borrow the handgun he was carrying. After Zhou refused, he angered the three men. At that time, one person immediately pulled out a sharp axe and hacked Zhou's head twice. Zhou was injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the three fled in separate directions. Later, Chinese Constable No. 2500 sent him to the hospital for treatment in a vehicle. It is said that his injuries are severe and his life is in danger.</p>
<p>Foreman Slashed: Zhang Maohai, a 27-year-old man from Shandong, worked as a foreman in the spinning room of the Xinyu No. 1 Yarn Factory at No. 37, West Suzhou Road. Yesterday morning around 6:00 AM, when Zhang went to the factory to work, he was suddenly attacked by Wang San, a worker who had been laid off by the factory, who pulled out a sharp axe and hacked Zhang all over his body. He sustained more than ten injuries, bled profusely, and fell to the ground unconscious. By the time the nearby Chinese constables arrived, the murderer had already fled without a trace. The injured man was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment, and his life is in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Jiang Yusheng Memorial Service</h3>
<p>Jiang Yusheng, a giant in the Shanghai construction industry, passed away due to illness on December 3rd of last year. At that time, his eldest son, Dr. Changchuan, had not returned from the World Christian Conference in India, so the memorial service was postponed until 2:00 PM yesterday. It was held at Moore Memorial Church. Hundreds of Jiang's relatives and friends came to offer their condolences. Organizations such as the Shanghai Construction Factory Association and Tonghui Elementary School also offered sacrifices. The hall was filled with memorial banners and elegiac couplets.

<h3>Lawyer Peng Qixiu Sued for Fraudulent Acquisition of Property: Civil Part Resolved in Court, Criminal Part Rescheduled for Further Hearing</h3>
<p>Lawyer Peng Qixiu, a native of Shaoxing, is being privately prosecuted in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court by Chen Hongqing, a Muslim (equivalent in status to priests and pastors in the Catholic and Protestant faiths), for fraudulent acquisition of property, requesting legal investigation. According to the complaint, Chen Hongqing stated that he rented a house belonging to the Xu Jia Hui Road Mosque and owed more than 190 yuan in rent. The landlord commissioned Lawyer Peng to represent him in suing Chen in the Civil Court. Lawyer Peng kindly mediated on his behalf, agreeing that Chen would pay 14 yuan in monthly rent and not be in arrears, and also pay 6 yuan per month to settle the previous arrears, totaling 20 yuan per month. He asked Chen to pay two months in advance. Chen complied and delivered 40 yuan for two months' rent to Lawyer Peng in April of last year. However, the case still could not be settled, and the money remained with Peng. Despite repeated demands and letters of urging, the money was not returned. He had no choice but to file a lawsuit for investigation, attaching a civil complaint, etc. The defendant, Peng Qixiu, admitted to receiving 40 yuan from the plaintiff. Because the landlord did not agree to a settlement, the matter was delayed. He was willing to return the money, but it was past the bank's withdrawal time today, and tomorrow is Sunday, and the day after tomorrow is Monday. He decided to return the full amount of money. The court verified the statements and mediated the civil part of the case in court, creating a record of the settlement. The criminal part was rescheduled for further verification.</p>
<h3>Opening a Coffin Storage Facility Fails, Disputes Arise Over Shares: Shares Transferred as Loans, Chairman Suddenly Denies and Criminally Sues the Manager for Forgery</h3>
<p>Chen Pengnian, a real estate merchant from Ningbo residing at No. 38, Xuehua Lane, Rue Chévert, in the French Concession, and Chen Yunfei, were recently sued by Dong Yunyan, Yu Chengxiu, and Lawyer Huang Zengjie, filing a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing them of forgery, illegal use of seals, perjury, etc. The indictment stated that the defendant, Chen Pengnian, previously partnered with the plaintiff to open the Fushou Coffin Storage Facility, with the plaintiff serving as chairman and the defendant, Chen Pengnian, as manager. Chen Yunfei was Chen's relative and was introduced by him to work at the facility as an administrator. However, Chen Pengnian failed to obtain a business license for the coffin storage facility, resulting in huge losses. He colluded with Chen Yunfei to forge a withdrawal agreement and a loan agreement, suing the plaintiff in civil court for the return of a 2,000 yuan deposit. Because the plaintiff was bedridden at the time and unable to appear in court, he was deceived. The Civil Court ordered the plaintiff to repay the full amount. Currently, after returning to Shanghai from Haimen, he inquired from various sources and learned that the so-called loan agreement was written by Gu Nianchun at the request of the first defendant, using blank paper bearing the plaintiff's seal. He requested that handwriting analysis be performed to clarify the truth. Although the plaintiff did not dare to confirm that the seal was forged before authentication, the defendant's guilt of illegally using the seal and forging documents was unavoidable. Chen Yunfei, pretending to be the plaintiff's secretary, was also responsible for jointly forging the withdrawal agreement. They should be charged under Articles 210, 218, and 168 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant Chen Yunfei was absent, and only Chen Pengnian appeared with his defense lawyers Qian Xingzhong and Zhang Juansheng.</p>
<p>Presented a defense, stating that the defendant had invested 2,000 yuan in shares in the Fushou Coffin Storage Facility. Later, because the facility could not be established, the plaintiff proposed operating a new economic village. The defendant did not agree and expressed his withdrawal from the partnership. The plaintiff, in his capacity as chairman of the facility, signed a transfer agreement with the defendant on June 19th. The 2,000 yuan in shares that the facility owed the defendant was negotiated to be treated as a loan. The plaintiff also issued a loan agreement on the same day, limiting the repayment to within three months. The defendant took the transfer agreement and the loan agreement to the Xinfu Real Estate Company at No. 6, World Lane, Fuzhou Road. After a friend, Wu Zikun, read it, he believed that the words "and voluntarily waive the right to prior lawsuit defense" should be added to the loan agreement. The defendant immediately asked the plaintiff for consent, who agreed to accept it. However, because the secretary had already left, the defendant asked Gu Nianchun, a secretary at the Pingheng Law Firm, to rewrite it on another piece of paper, and took it along with the original loan agreement to the plaintiff to have him stamp it again. At the same time, the facility's architect, Ma Pinqi, was also present and can testify. Later, because the facility declared its closure, the defendant sent letters to the plaintiff on August 3rd and 9th, urging him to repay the loan, but to no avail. He had no choice but to petition the Civil Court, which had already made a judgment and was determined to enforce it. The investigation revealed that during the civil lawsuit, the plaintiff never claimed that the loan was forged by the defendant. Suddenly, when the defendant claimed the funds, the plaintiff declared that he had filed a criminal lawsuit and requested a stay of execution. This was malicious and self-evident. It must be known that the ironclad evidence of the civil judgment cannot be overturned by empty words. He requested that a verdict of not guilty be issued. Under Judge Xiao's questioning, he instructed both parties to go out and attempt a settlement. The case was rescheduled for another hearing.</p>
<h3>French Concession Authorities Ban Fireworks</h3>

<h3>Boy Run Over and Killed on Xinzha Road: No. 10 Public Bus Causes Accident, Boy's Brain Splattered</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 12:45, in front of the laundry shop at No. 470 Xinzha Road (east end of Chengdu Road) in the Public Concession, a No. 3 tram with a trailer was stopped there, waiting for a No. 3 tram traveling from west to east to pass. At this time, a boy of about ten years old, resembling a student, wanted to cross the road in front of the tram. Unexpectedly, a No. 10 public bus came straight from west to east. The boy was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked down, lying face down on the tram tracks. The wheels of the No. 10 public bus ran over his abdomen, back, and head. The boy's intestines flowed out, his brain splattered, and he was dragged by the wheels for more than ten feet. The scene was bloody and gruesome.

<h3>Robbery of 7,000 Yuan: Gunfire Used to Resist Arrest, Resulting in One Bandit Being Captured and 7,000 Yuan Recovered Intact</h3>
<p>The Yongtaihe Tobacco Company at No. 784 Jiujiang Road has a branch company in Dapuqiao, French Concession. Yesterday morning at 8:30, the branch company ordered a clerk to carry over 7,000 yuan in cash to the head office. He took Public Bus No. 21 to the Great World on Avenue Edward VII, then changed to Trolleybus No. 18 to the intersection of Rue Yu-tsia-tsing and Nanjing Road. As he walked to the intersection of Rue Yu-tsia-tsing and Jiujiang Road, nearing the head office, three bandits who had been lying in wait suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two bandits, armed with pistols, stepped forward and forcibly robbed the clerk of the 7,000 yuan in cash he was carrying. Just as they were about to flee with the loot, they were spotted by Chinese Constable No. 100 on patrol, who rushed to arrest them. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest, and the constable also drew his gun and returned fire. Gunshots rang out, and bullets flew everywhere. The two sides exchanged more than ten shots. Fortunately, there were few people on the street, and no one was injured. Other Chinese constables heard the commotion and joined in the pursuit. They chased the bandits to the vicinity of Cide Lane on Jiujiang Road, where they apprehended one of the bandits, seizing a pistol, six bullets, and the original stolen cash of 7,000 yuan. The other two bandits escaped. They were taken to the police station, and after an investigation by detectives, they were closely investigating the remaining members of the gang, to ensure that all were apprehended and brought to justice.</p>

<h3>Local Bullies in Sijiao Act as Accomplices, Monopolizing Sand and Gravel Transportation to Shanghai: Boatmen and Coolies Strike in Opposition, Association Issues Public Notice Calling for Action Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yellow sand is the main raw material for engineering and construction. Since the fall of Shanghai, due to the sudden increase in residents within the concessions, the construction industry has shown a booming trend. Therefore, the demand for yellow sand is extremely urgent. Merchants in the industry hire sailing boats to purchase and transport it from the sand pits of Sijiao. Now, a local bully named Jin from the area has joined forces with Chinese traitors to organize a sand and gravel company, monopolizing everything. They have detained more than 20 imported sand and gravel sailing boats, including those belonging to Qiu Wende, using special forces. Workers and boatmen in the sand and gravel industry are forced to make a living and are outraged. They have launched a unified strike and industry-wide shutdown starting today, vowing to oppose it to the death. After receiving reports from colleagues, the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Industry Association issued a public notice yesterday calling on all parties to stop it. According to a recent report jointly signed by members of our association, a local bully named Jin from Sijiao has colluded with a certain party to organize the "Wantai Company," attempting to monopolize the transportation of sand and gravel to Shanghai and exclusively profit. Such a motive will inevitably wipe out the livelihoods of the people in the sand pits, boatmen, coolies, and hundreds of members. The industry is outraged and fears that they will take risks and cause trouble. Therefore, we are writing to your association to seek assistance. The transportation of sand and gravel to Shanghai is essential for the construction of the concessions and is also the livelihood of the poor. Once monopolized, it will inevitably affect people's livelihood, and it is difficult to ensure that there will be no accidents. Our association is limited by the environment and cannot do anything. Therefore, we are issuing this public notice, hoping that all sectors will rise up to stop it, maintain the livelihoods of tens of thousands of poor people, and plan ahead to prevent incidents. We urge you to do so."</p>

<h3>Financial North China Foreign Banks Again Vigorously Absorbing Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>The Result of Chinese and Western Businesses Competing to Sell is Not Yet Severe</p>
<p>The exchange market yesterday was favorable to the North China foreign banks, which vigorously absorbed foreign exchange. The major foreign firms were also chasing after, causing the underlying trend to be quite tight. The pound sterling once retreated to eight pence one two five, while HSBC maintained its price. The US dollar also softened to fifteen yuan eight seven five. However, in the end, due to the competing selling of Hong Kong Electric, Sassoon, and Jardine Matheson, the resulting tightness was not too severe. There were slight fluctuations in the middle, and trading was quite active. The Hong Kong dollar also continued to soften due to the vigorous buying by foreign firms.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large telegraphic transfer (T/T) for near term contracted by 0.0625, and the long term also decreased by 125. The New York spot remained unchanged. The London raw gold also had no increase or decrease. The exchange rate of the pound against the dollar contracted by 0.13, against the franc it improved, and against Shanghai it fell by 0.0625. The dollar against the pound decreased by 0.25, against the franc contracted by 0.0625, and against Shanghai remained level. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The banks opened early, with the spot selling price of the pound at eight pence one four zero six two five, and the dollar at fifteen yuan nine zero six two five, which was 0.03125 tighter for both the pound and dollar compared to the previous day. After the opening, the North China foreign banks and foreign firms suddenly became active, competing to vigorously absorb foreign exchange. HSBC, Chartered Bank, American Express, and other foreign banks only quoted eight pence one two five for the pound and fifteen yuan eight seven five for the dollar, so the situation was quite soft. HSBC's listed price announcement was unchanged, and the silver equalization tax announcement was small at 0.25, with an assessment of 6.00%. After this, although the foreign banks still came with force to absorb foreign exchange, the selling intentions of Hong Kong Electric, Western firm Sassoon, Chinese banks, and Jardine Matheson were quite strong, so the underlying trend turned looser and harder. Hong Kong Electric, Sassoon, Jardine Matheson, and Chinese banks sold the pound at eight pence one four zero six two five, and the dollar at fifteen yuan nine zero six two five to Holland Bank. The most banks and money changers quoted 54.5 yuan for the Hong Kong dollar, and the market situation was also tight. By the time of the noon closing, the banks' selling prices were eight pence one four zero six two five for the pound and fifteen yuan nine zero six two five for the dollar. As a result, the pound and dollar were both 0.03125 tighter compared to the previous closing, and the Hong Kong dollar also softened by 0.125. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Here is the record of the opening transactions for half a day:</p>
<h3>Tianjin Merchants Re-Search for Purchases Cash Price Seen Moving Up Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash silver ingot open market situation continued to rise, because the foreign exchange was suddenly tight and soft under the pulling by North China foreign banks, which caused Tianjin merchants to entrust money changers to relentlessly force their way in. At the same time, the rich in this city and merchants from the north were also secretly active in absorbing purchases. Fortunately, the silver shop merchants, gold shops, and money changers were still willing to supply, so the increase on that day was limited. However, there were still few changes in the middle, and the people's hearts were firm and stable. Trading was similar to the previous day. Silver shop jewelry initially listed at one yuan, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold returned to unchanged levels.</p>
<h3>Silver Ingots Rise Six Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the early morning, a certain money changer immediately called out 2,048 yuan to buy one bar of silver (ten taels each). Silver shop merchants were only willing to supply if the price was 50 yuan. At that time, under the pulling of foreign exchanges by foreign banks in Pingjin, the underlying trend was quite tight, so the buyer's intention to enter became stronger. First, a money changer bought 100 taels from silver shop merchants and 50 taels from gold shops, all at the opening price of 2,050 yuan. After the opening, merchants from the north also followed to buy, buying 50 taels from silver shop merchants at a price of 52 yuan. Subsequently, a money changer came to search for purchases again, buying 50 taels from silver shop merchants at a price of 51 yuan, and buying 50 taels each from silver shop merchants and gold shops, all at a price of 50 yuan. Later, at the same price, merchants from the north bought 50 taels from silver shop merchants, and a money changer bought 50 taels of silver coins from silver shop merchants at a price of 52 yuan. Afterwards, after Western merchants sold after the foreign exchange was transmitted by telegram, it showed a slight rebound, and another money changer came out with money on behalf of the clients, so the price fell and sold 100 taels to a money changer at a price of 50 yuan (it is said that the money changer’s purchases were mostly on behalf of Tianjin merchants). Later, the silver shop merchants sold 50 taels to a money changer at a price of 52 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the money changers initially mutually made 50 taels at a price of 52 yuan. After this, the supply and demand suddenly thinned, and the price also became unchanged. Forced to about 3:30 PM, a silver shop suddenly had a buying wind. However, at that time, sellers were extremely scarce, so it raised the price to 54 yuan, and a silver shop bought 50 taels from a money changer. Although a silver shop continued to have buying intentions, sellers became even more difficult to find, so no transactions were made, so the evening closing was still 2,054 yuan, which was six yuan higher compared to the previous day (a difference of four yuan throughout the day). The cash gold shop's own brand gold sold at 2,060 yuan and bought back at 2,045 yuan. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and no transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Listed Up One Yuan</h3>
<p>The price of jewelry per tael was initially opened in the morning, and in view of the steady underlying trend of silver ingots, the price was listed up one yuan. Da Tong Hang and Lao Qingyun changed to 208 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang also changed to 206 yuan, buying back at 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Pure Gold Remained Unchanged</h3>
<p>The London telegram of the 10th stated that the price of English pure gold per ounce had not changed, remaining at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 3.5 pence, so the Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price also remained unchanged at 1,210 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold was unchanged, remaining at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged, still calculated at 1,205 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<h3>Most Foreign Currencies Increased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of English pure gold did not move, and the exchange rate of the English dollar decreased by 0.25. Foreign exchange settlements were slightly active, and the banks' supply was not smooth. The market price was soft in the middle. Later, Hong Kong Electric slightly dumped, and the firms' willingness to sell was still refreshing. The market price returned to level, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous night. There is no market on Saturday afternoon. The opening of silver ingots was still level. Later, retail investors gradually began to absorb, and Tianjin merchants made slight purchases. The supply from gold shops and money changers was not much, and the chips were slightly lacking. The market price was high. Afternoon transactions were rare, and the trend was tight. Because the foreign currency bills were once soft, and the silver ingots were firm, the rich made slight absorptions, and the market price rose slightly. Door-to-door transactions were still prosperous, and the association's transactions were not opened. Yesterday's market prices were: English gold bills up 8 fen, American surplus bills up 0.5 fen, Hong Kong bills up 0.02 yuan, French franc bills up 0.005 yuan, Canadian bills up 6.5 fen, Italian lira down 0.02 yuan, and most other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rates Remained Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange draft bills once rose, but it returned to level immediately after rising. Per thousand yuan, it once rose from 35 yuan to 35.5 yuan, but it soon returned to level, and finally the price was 25 yuan, which was the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3>T/T Near and Long Term Returned Downwards Indian Silver Spot Long Term Contracted</h3>
<p>The London telegram of the 10th stated that speculators sold, and the market was level. After the closing, it was still level. The silver large T/T near term contracted by 0.0625, and the long term also contracted by 0.125. The New York silver telegram stated that the American silver price remained unchanged. The Bombay silver telegram stated that Indian silver had differences. The spot returned long by 1 anna, the near term continued to fall by 1 anna, and the long term fell by 2 annas.</p>
<h3>Securities Hainan Affects Maritime Bond Market</h3>
<p>Only Two Days of Trading Left</p>
<p>The securities open market trend suddenly changed again yesterday. The bond market, due to the alarm that the Japanese army actually landed on Hainan Island, this move posed a great threat to the colonies of countries such as Britain and France. At the same time, China's international transportation lines also felt a great crisis, which had to be considered of great significance. Whether this move was deliberately threatening to force the countries concerned to use forceful mediation of the Sino-Japanese issue, in order to fulfill their original intention of seeking peace, and whether the countries were subject to its restraint and willing to act as puppets, or whether retaliatory actions would occur, was unknown. However, public bonds had been unexpectedly hit, and they had declined after tending to rise in one go. This matter was of great importance, and the future development was unpredictable. In the midst of this crisis of suspicion and shock, the fluctuations in public bonds were bound to be greater than before.</p>
<p>The process of yesterday was that the initial opening seemed to be stable, because Yongkang and Xinfeng still had buying. Suddenly, Xie Dahao had too many sales, and the shaking and unstable hearts of the people suddenly caused a storm of falling prices. Tongkanghao and retail investors also tended to sell, and the price became more and more unsustainable. Because Category A happened to be after the lottery draw, most of those who failed to be lucky wanted to sell, so it fell sharply by more than one yuan in half a day, and the other types also fell by a small amount of 0.5-0.6 yuan. In the afternoon, Xie Da continued to sell, and the number was also large. Only Tiansheng and Yongkanghao slightly bought in the market, and retail investors entered more and sold less. The market price continued to weaken. However, because Category B had a continuous lottery relationship, there were more eating households, and the initial meeting was slightly stronger, and finally fell due to excessive supply. After this major blow to the market price, the hearts of the people were scattered and suspicious, and it was not easy to raise their heads for a while. Tracing the results of the market price, there was a uniform decline, ranging from a small amount of 0.65 yuan to 1.25 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated at 800,000-900,000 yuan. There were no transactions for 96. Fortunately, the bond market only had two more days of business, and the changes should not be huge. The brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, there was a transaction of 100 shares of Great China Match Company stock, at a price of 12.6 yuan. There were no other transactions.</p>
<p>The listed market prices of London Chinese foreign bonds on the 10th of this month (Friday) have stabilized, and the English gold clearing bond issued by the English bond actually contracted by 0.5 pound, with a price of 48.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged. In the London physical market supply and demand, the buyer offered 3,000 pounds for the English gold clearing bond issued by the English bond, at a price of 48 pounds and 5 shillings, which was slightly reduced by 5 shillings. The seller had 1,000 pounds of Huguang Railway German bond with printed bonds, at a selling price of 19 pounds and 15 shillings, which was reduced by 5 shillings. There was also 1,600 pounds of Guangjiu Railway bond, at a selling price of 18.5 pounds, which was reduced by 1.5 pounds. There were also 2,000 pounds of Sino-French US 5% bond (ie, US 10,000), at a selling price of 69 pounds and 5 shillings, which was raised by 1.5 pounds. Although the current market price has been raised, the foundation is still not solid.</p>
<p>The listed market prices of stocks of London British Far East companies on the 10th of this month (Friday) show that bank stocks have risen again. Chartered Bank stock continued to rise by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of 9 pounds and 15 shillings. HSBC English-registered stock rose by 1 pound, with a price of 82.5 pounds, and Hong Kong-registered stock rose by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 85 pounds. Korean mining stock shrank by 6 pence, with a price of 6 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn Jardine Matheson Japanese Invasion of Hainan Concerns Jardine Matheson's Sale of South China</h3>
<p>Profits and More Competing to Sell the Market Price Fell Three or Four Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market is showing weakness, with the daily decline being more intense. Sales to customers are exceptionally quiet, and all merchants have no signs of activity. In fact, there are not many days left in the year, and the number of ships in operation will also be suspended for several days, with only one or two flights determined. As a result, the actual need has been reduced. At the same time, some people, due to the Japanese army landing on Hainan Island, are concerned that it will affect the sale of yarn to South China in the future. Generally, those who can make a slight profit are suddenly competing to sell, but although the number of shares has not surged, at the end of this period, it has already been heavily mortgaged, and acceptance is lacking. The market price is falling step by step, and transactions that can be made among counterparts are even rarer. As for the hoarding households, they have been dragging in continuously for several days, and the amount is huge. For the time being, they have no intention of doing anything, and a certain cotton company is selling every day in the market, cutting off most of the shares to prepare for closing accounts. As a result, the table has become looser.</p>
<h3>Actual Sales Only One Hundred and More Bales</h3>
<p>In the current situation of yarn, the initial opening in the early morning was still peaceful, but the counterparts gathered and talked empty words, because the actual appetite of the customer merchants was sluggish, and most of them had no telegrams to handle the goods, so there was no transaction. The opening price of 20 double horses was unchanged, and 15 bales were sold, at a price of 400 yuan. After a while, the counterparts and retail investors, in view of the cold business and the tense situation on Hainan Island, suddenly had crowded sellers, and the market fell step by step, and the popularity turned weak. Finally, the price of 20 double horses was done at 397.5 yuan, and the minimum price of the warehouse receipt was 393.5 yuan. As a result, the total transaction volume in the morning was only 462 bales. The selling price of 20 double horses yarn fell by two yuan compared to the previous day, and the special Jincheng fell by four yuan, the double Earth fell by four yuan, and the Tiannv fell by two yuan. No transactions were made for ten coarse yarns, and the factory did not open either. Today, 25 pieces of yarn were shipped to Fuzhou, 140 pieces were shipped to Shantou, 20 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 370 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. Here is a list of the amount bought by each merchant:</p>
<p>Counterparts 340 Wenzhou 30</p>
<p>Fujian 30 Hong Kong 20</p>
<p>Ningbo 3 Shantou 20</p>
<p>Yunnan 2 Statistics 463</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn Makes People Unable to Enter or Exit</h3>
<p>The Japanese yarn market situation remains sluggish as before. The needs of all parties have completely entered a state of standstill. Therefore, the market price has not made much progress or retreat and is similar to the previous day. The current yarn price of 20 Shuiyue is 326 yuan, and the current yarn price of 20 Lanfeng is 321-322 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Weekend Statistics</h3>
<p>The New York telegram stated that the American cotton statistics from August 1, last year to February 10 this year are listed on the left,</p>
<p>(Unit: bales, 500 pounds per bale)</p>
<p>Cumulative listing this season 7,700,000</p>
<p>Cumulative factory use since August 1 3,942,000</p>
<p>Cumulative exports 2,430,000</p>

<p>Of which, American cotton 7,230,000</p>
<p>Since August 1, worldwide use of American cotton 6,253,000</p>
<h3>Haiphong Transportation May Be Threatened Raw Cotton Factory Handling is Even More Apathetic</h3>
<p>The foreign cotton market price, New York American cotton opened firmly in the early morning, because a part of short selling hedging rose, and counterparts also had slight transactions. Congressman Smith recently suggested that the government extract 1.5 million bales of American cotton from the loan cotton project every year to compensate those who voluntarily reduce cotton fields again. However, although this proposal was opposed by the public, the government promised to consider it again and decided to respond in the next session. Yesterday, the recent period of New York rose by 2 pounds of sound, the long term fell by 2 pounds of sound, India fell by 0.5 rupee, and Egypt rose by 3.5 pounds of sound. Yesterday, the exchange rate was quite tired, and the legal currency was converted, and the cotton price rose instead. It is estimated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 0.5 yuan per picul, Indian cotton rose by 0.7 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 1 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction is very quiet. Since the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, the general textile industry is deeply afraid that the Haiphong transportation will be threatened. A part of the cotton yarn hoarding households are considering that the red plate price will be difficult to develop. As a result, various yarn factories are even more apathetic about purchasing foreign cotton, so there will be no huge transactions within the year. Here is a record of yesterday's cotton prices:</p>
<p>The local cotton business is still bleak, and only counterparts buy it as a decoration. The factory's ability to be difficult to implement, and the market price is also not exciting. The source of northern Jiangsu is even more diminished. It is estimated that 687 bales of Tongzhou cotton and 110 pieces of Beisha are coming. Here is a record of the current cotton transaction situation:</p>
<h3>Grain It is rumored that a certain party is buying wheat in the market</h3>
<p>The highest reaches 6.9 yuan But this statement is difficult to verify</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was as firm as before. From the factory transaction, since the foreign wheat order arrived in Shanghai, there has been no enthusiastic removal, and most of the holders also plan to wait until next year to sell it, so they insist on not relaxing. It is also heard that although the various flour factories have not had a large turnover recently, a certain flour factory in Zhabei is still buying raw materials, so the market is firm. The open transaction in the unified market has no transaction of only one package, and the rumor that a certain party has purchased wheat at the highest price of 6.9 yuan, but this kind of rumor may be difficult to verify, it is said.</p>
<h3>Powder Shipped to Tianjin for Ten Thousand Packages The Market is Also Ending</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the powder market still had few changes, but the general situation was no longer as firm as in the previous two days, because the Lunar New Year is approaching, and both buyers and sellers lack enjoyment. The retail sales to both the north and south merchants are still not bad, but there has been no large transaction, so the market is showing signs of ending. The total transaction volume of the city is less than 20,000 packages. In addition to 7,000-8,000 packages of scattered batches in this street, the Cantonese, Fujian, Hebei, and Shandong merchants only jointly handled more than 10,000 packages. The price of No. 2 flour factory is still 4.8 yuan. At a time when the current flour of various factories is lacking, the market can still be stable.</p>
<p>Today, 10,500 packages of flour will be shipped to Tianjin, 4,000 packages will be shipped to Shantou, and 7,000 packages will be shipped to Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Turned Active in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Du Rice Had Many Discounted Share Sales</p>
<p>The Customer Xian Market yesterday fell at the same time as the local sharp, with prices ranging from a few cents to the outside of the corner. Because the floating vendors and retail investors mainly ended their year, the morning selling was extremely strong, and the market was quite depressed, with only 700-800 packages sold at low prices. However, in the afternoon, because the price was low, the store attracted factories along the road and opened more than 2,000 packages. Although the market situation has not been reversed, the market atmosphere is no longer as sluggish as in the morning. There were 1,000 packages from the east of Hupu yesterday.</p>
<p>The Du Rice market is ending on the 14th, with only two days of trading left. The situation has shown a decline. The sources from all roads are scarce, and only No. 5 of Hexia has arrived, with more than 1,000 packages of cart steamed buns, and the sales in this street lack a large appetite, so those who have a lot of goods in hand only plan to get rid of them quickly, and the price reduction is quite chaotic. As a result, the prices of the various goods have fallen again, and the transactions are ultimately limited. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice have depreciated by a few cents to 1-2 corners, and the prices of Du Yangjian and Bu Jian have also continued to fall by about a corner. Only Bian Yuan, because of the scarcity of goods and delicious taste, is still stable.</p>
<h3>Metals White Lead Skin Turns Easy To Old Appearance Battery Factory Handling Suddenly Dense</h3>
<p>The white lead skin market, which has been quiet for a long time, changed its old appearance yesterday because the battery factory was handling it. For example, the inventory of colors No. 5 and 6 has almost been exhausted by the city, and the market price has suddenly risen by more than 10 yuan. The highest price of No. 5 is 220 yuan per barrel, and No. 6 is sold for 208 yuan. However, there are still many people searching for handling, but the new goods are not followed up, and the bottom storage is exhausted, and there is a worry of out of stock in the coming days. Other colors are relatively quiet because the battery factory's intentions are lighter, and customers are waiting and seeing, but the market price is also brought up by 1-2 yuan, such as No. 2 sold for 226 yuan per barrel, No. 3 sold for 222 yuan per barrel, No. 4 sold for 220 yuan, and Nos. 7 and 8 sold for 300 yuan. The inventory of No. 9 is thinner, so the selling price is 235 yuan. No. 10 is even more scarce for circulating goods, so the opening price is outside of 240 yuan, and other thick colors have even less inventory, so the opening price is about 250 yuan. It is estimated that the overseas price is about 25 pounds per ton, and the cost is about 250-260 yuan according to the exchange rate, so the counterparts dare not purchase it, it is said.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes</h3>
<p>Amidst the Sound of New Year Drums, Another Batch of Futures Opens for Bean Cakes</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 12,000 pieces were transacted, all handled by the Quanzhou merchants.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous imbalance between supply and demand for bean cakes, they have long maintained a superior position with more gains than losses. Yesterday, the Quanzhou merchants suddenly inquired about futures trading as the year-end approached, suggesting that future potential remains strong. Yesterday afternoon, Changzhou Xie Feng Factory's "Yuan Long" brand was opened for 7,000 pieces, with delivery scheduled for the first half of March, priced at $3.17. By closing time, Pu Li Factory's "Fei" brand was also opened for 5,000 pieces, priced at $3.19. Therefore, the "Yuan Long" brand was not opened further due to tight demand. Currently, 1,000 pieces of "Yuan Long" brand cakes were transacted, with the price only at $3.11 due to inferior color, also handled by the Quanzhou merchants.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,200 cases of crude oil arrived from Qingdao, and today, 250 cases are being shipped to Fuzhou.</p>
<p>In terms of miscellaneous grains, 250 cases of peanuts arrived from Qingdao yesterday. Today, 900 bags of soybeans and 400 bags of raw kernels are being exported to Shantou, and 450 bags of split soybeans are being shipped to Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Taikoo Sugar</p>
<p>Transported from Xiamen after Duty Payment</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's trading board showed little fluctuation. Spot goods of Dutch No. 24 coarse white were priced at $24.15 at the outer warehouse and $24.30 at the local warehouse. Re-exported goods were priced at $16.20. Dutch red sugar was priced at $16.70 at the local warehouse and $11 for re-exports. According to the Joint Operating Office's inventory, there are still 32,000 bags of Dutch red sugar and 11,000 bags of Taikoo "H" mark red sugar. The Taikoo white sugar market was also flat. "B" mark goods at the western warehouse were priced at $24, "CW" mark at $23.90, "CX" mark at $23.80, "DY" mark at $23.70, and "HX" mark at $23.60. Arrivals included 2,950 bags of Taikoo white sugar, 10 bags of Taikoo "H" mark red sugar, and 1,000 bags of Taikoo ice "CC" mark, imported by the Jia Ying Wheel. It is said that these were re-exported from Xiamen after duty payment. If so, the previous rumor about duty payment in Xiamen has been confirmed. The forward delivery of Taikoo sugar, opened the day before yesterday, involved 11,000 bags ready for shipment, priced at HK$9.25 to HK$8.885.</p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<p>Textiles Quietly Await the New Year Market</p>
<p>Export Goods Are Still Lively</p>
<p>Due to the consistent efforts of local merchants to prepare for year-end closures, the market is unusually quiet. Only scattered purchases are being made by merchants, and prices from various goods factories are high. Wholesale prices are also firm. The asking price for white cloth is slightly up by five cents per bolt, while colored cloth is flat. Various factories are quietly awaiting the spring sales of bleached cloth, poplin, ramie yarn, and foreign yarn, and are raising prices, unwilling to compromise. Merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Fujian are still placing many orders, all to be shipped within the year. Order deliveries in this street remain lively, but the number of new purchases is very small, nearing the end.</p>
<p>The eastern cloth trade is gradually quieting down. Local businesses in this street saw only small transactions yesterday. Large-scale wholesale merchants transferring funds to warehouses have mostly settled their accounts. However, because hoarding continues for white cloth, prices continue to rise. The market price for "Ten Good Pounds Rainbow Ball" is up by ten cents per bolt, selling for $12.15. Fine twill is relatively stable. There is little change in "Dragon Head" and "Yang Crane" compared to the previous day's market, likely because selling prices for colored twill have not increased, and dyeing factories are showing little interest. The foreign firm's forward price for "Dragon Head" fine twill is $12, with a counteroffer of $11.80 not accepted. The gap with spot goods is widening, and no transactions have been made.</p>
<p>Today, 480 pieces are being shipped to Tianjin, 110 pieces to Yantai, 60 pieces to Fuzhou, 680 pieces to Shantou, 10 pieces to Hong Kong, and 170 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Silk Transactions with Foreign Firms Are</p>
<p>Difficult to Approach</p>
<p>Both Chinese and foreign silk prices are reported to be firm. Yesterday, the New York exchange opened with prices rising again by one or two points, further strengthening the market in this port. Factories remain optimistic and firmly hold their positions, making transactions with foreign firms difficult to approach. As for Indian firms' sales, they became sparse yesterday, likely because the price of native silk has risen to a high level, and continuous large-scale purchases over the past few days seem to have satisfied demand. Therefore, yesterday's transactions were somewhat less active, with a total of 12 bales of medium-to-upper-grade Zhili silk transacted, with selling prices increasing by more than $5 per bale.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods</h3>
<p>High-Quality Sun-Dried Meat Rises by About $3</p>
<p>A dozen or so pieces of top-quality sun-dried longan meat arrived the day before yesterday. Samples were seen yesterday, and both quality and color were excellent. Because the cost was very high, the original price was not readily lowered. After negotiations, a deal was quickly reached, with prices rising by about $3 compared to before, but the sales price in the market was lower, with a difference of $2.</p>
<h3>Seafood</h3>
<p>Ten Pieces of Chaozhou Golden Hook Shrimp Sold</p>
<p>Recently, a batch of Chaozhou Jieshi golden hook shrimp tails was opened by a Chaozhou firm for ten pieces yesterday. The color of the goods was still good, but some were slightly soft. The asking price was $83 per picul (cash). Yesterday, the Jia Ying Wheel imported 172 pieces of sea cucumber and 6 pieces of shark fin, transshipped from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Answering Mr. Song of Huangqiao Jiali Town Regarding Inquiry about Small Flour Milling Machines</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I read in your newspaper on January 24th that Mr. Song of Huangqiao inquired about small flour milling machines. Inquiries to various foreign firms in Shanghai will naturally not be satisfactory. After I returned to China from studying in Europe, I found that the most suitable small flour milling machines are the English and German types.</p>
<p>The English type includes the following machines: a wheat sifter, a wheat brushing machine, a pair of vertical stone grinding discs, and two silk flour sifters, powered by a 5-horsepower belt. It can produce 300 catties of wheat per hour, yielding 200 catties of flour, with a price of about $4,000 to $5,000 for the complete set. If a smaller size is needed, it can be powered by a 1-horsepower motor, producing 40 pounds of flour per hour (without wheat cleaning), priced at about $1,200.</p>
<p>The German type machine is as follows: It can process one shi dan (110 pounds) of wheat per hour, requiring 7 horsepower. It includes a wheat sifter, a wheat cleaning machine, a dust removal machine, a small magnet, a double roller mill (stone rollers are better than steel rollers because they don't generate heat), a pair of silk flat sifters, connected to a 7-foot square sifter box and an iron frame, priced at $1,600 to $2,400 in national currency. Flour produced by traditional stone mills, using damp wheat, cannot be stored for long; it will become moldy within a month at most, and the bran will ferment and become smelly within three to five days. This type of machine processes entirely dry wheat, which is its first advantage. Large flour mills use silk flat sifters, so the flour produced is fine. A No. 9 silk sifter produces No. 2 flour, the same as this machine. Traditional methods use bamboo sieves with larger openings, no better than No. 5 or No. 6 (i.e., 60 openings), so the flour is not separated from the bran. Also, because of the flat stone mill, the wheat is not evenly distributed, and the stone pieces rub against each other, grinding down sand that mixes into the flour, causing a gritty sound.</p>
<p>In the new-style small flour mills around Wuxi, there are no fewer than a hundred, only using electric power to drive flat stone mills, with an addition of an Archimedes screw and steel sieves, which are not exemplary.</p>
<p>It is important to know that small mills do not have double or multiple grinding, so the flour produced is not as well-separated into No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, and bran as in large mills. Even large Chinese mills do not produce No. 1 flour and have no flour-beating machines, so the flour yield cannot match that of large mills. Large mills have a yield of 72%, while small mills have a yield of 70%. The flour produced initially is white, with a yield of 55%, and the flour produced later (slightly) has some bran, but this method is already far better than current practices.</p>
<p>Now, what I would like to ask is: Which province and county does Huangqiao belong to? (Note: Huangqiao Jiali Town belongs to Rugao County, Jiangsu Province.) How much capital is Mr. Song willing to invest? How many bags of flour does he want to produce? What is the local price of wheat (per 100 catties)? What is the local price of foreign flour, i.e., the flour from large mills, and whose brand is it? What is the price of local flour? Is there a market for bran in my hometown? The income from bran should not be underestimated. If Mr. Song of Huangqiao is truly interested, I can provide a budget and design, arrange everything until the flour is produced, and provide flour bags. Please decide on the machine quickly, and after installation and testing, flour can be produced in two and a half months, just in time. We can discuss the compensation after you are satisfied. After flour production, I must go elsewhere, but I can teach someone to manage it. I am currently installing a German-style small flour mill in Zhou Tie Qiao Xia Zhu Street, Yixing. A small boat comes from Wuxi. Please forward to Mr. Zhu Haoyuan of the German-Asian Company at No. 226 Qiqi Road, French Concession, or Zhu Dingzhi, No. 13 Ping An Lane, Pushi Road.</p>

<p>Competing on the Evening of the 18th Upon Arrival in Shanghai, the Paramount Team Will Fight with Borrowed Players</p>
<p>(Manila, 10th, Associated Press) The Seattle Amateur Athletic Association basketball team (i.e., the Washington University All-Star Basketball Team) has confirmed a performance game in Shanghai. The team manager, Ralph Cairney, announced today that the New York Amateur Athletic Association has sent a telegram approving it. The team will travel to Hong Kong on the Empress of Russia and then transfer to the Japanese post office ship Asama Maru to Shanghai. After the game in Shanghai, they will still take the Asama Maru to Honolulu for a game there, he said.</p>
<p>(Another Report) The Washington University basketball team has been scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the Philippines on the 18th (Saturday). On the same evening at 8 o'clock, a performance match will be held at the YMCA gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road. The opposing team will be organized by Lu Zhong'en. According to Lu, the Paramount team will be the main force of the league to fight. To increase strength, top players from other teams will be invited to join and help. Bradney, the director of the YMCA sports department, received a letter from Cainey, the manager of the Washington team, stating that the team had obtained permission from the Washington University authorities, so they decided to come to Shanghai to play. Cainey also introduced the players' resumes. Washington University had strong strength when it participated in the US preliminary election of the last Olympic Games in 1936, and was the best of the university teams. Most of the players on this expedition are players from that time, so the team is a top-notch team on the West Coast of the United States. Shanghai fans will be able to feast their eyes at that time. Tickets are divided into reserved seats at $3 and ordinary seats at $2. Now pre-sale at the YMCA. The resumes of the players are translated as follows:</p>
<p>Ross Werner, Captain, 6 feet 2 inches tall, 190 pounds, was selected as a member of the West Coast representative team and serves as a forward.</p>
<p>Chuck Wagner, 6 feet 2 inches tall, 180 pounds, was selected as a member of the West Coast representative team and serves as a guard. He is one of the outstanding talents on the Pacific coast last year.</p>
<p>Ed Loverich, 6 feet 1 and a half inches tall, 205 pounds, reserve forward of the US Olympic team in 1936. He is the one who scored the most points on this expedition to the Far East, and is one of the best forwards rarely seen on the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>Jack Gannon, 6 feet tall, 160 pounds, scored the most points when he was in school, and is a sharp forward for the team. Bon Egge, 6 feet tall, 170 pounds, has been selected as a member of the West Coast representative team and the Northern representative team, and serves as a guard. He has great confidence in grabbing rebounds.</p>
<p>Dick Egge, 6 feet tall, 165 pounds, is the brother of B Egge and serves as a forward. He and his brother are both outstanding talents.</p>
<p>Jack Hanover, 5 feet 11 inches tall, is one of the smallest members of the team, weighing 175 pounds. He has been selected as a member of the Northern representative team.</p>
<p>Ralph Cairney, Manager, 6 feet tall, 180 pounds, has been repeatedly selected as a member of the West Coast representative team in 1931 and 1932, and serves as a guard.</p>
<h3>Tan Fuzhen and Zhang Xueyao</h3>
<p>Also Go South Together</p>
<p>Will Also Participate in Lido</p>
<p>In order to enhance its strength, the Lido Club sent a letter to Tan Fuzhen and Zhang Xueyao, famous football players in North China, inviting them to come to Shanghai. Yesterday, it received a reply telegram saying that they have now left Tianjin, but the name of the ship and the date were not mentioned, so the date of their arrival in Shanghai is still unknown. Tan is a famous backbone general in North China, and is good at middle column. Zhang is also the mainstay of the defense of Beining. Lido's strength will be strengthened.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi Provinces Promote Agricultural and Industrial Vocational Education Plans (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Divide the nine provinces into three regions and complete them within three years.</p>
<p>(Chongqing Newsletter) The plan to promote agricultural and industrial vocational education in the nine provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi was previously resolved, revised and approved by the Central Construction and Education Committee, and is now being ordered by the Ministry of Education. The common principles, the current situation in each region, and the future improvement plans are recorded below.</p>
<p>Principles: Each province's promotion of agricultural and industrial vocational education is divided into three regions for implementation: (A) Northwest Region, including the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai; (B) Sichuan-Kang Region, including the two provinces of Sichuan and Xikang; (C) Southwest Region, including the three provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan and Guangxi. Each region shall establish one or several national agricultural and industrial colleges, in conjunction with the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, the Central Industrial Experimental Institute, and the regional agricultural improvement institute, to be fully responsible for promoting and guiding agricultural and industrial education and technology within the region. Each province in each region shall, with reference to the province's agricultural and industrial occupations and raw material distribution, stipulate the locations and subjects for the establishment of senior and junior agricultural and industrial vocational schools. If necessary, factories or farms can be established first for the facilities of vocational schools, and a small number of apprentices can be trained according to their needs, and gradually expanded into graduation schools or training institutes. All teaching, practice, and improvement matters related to senior and junior vocational schools shall be planned and guided by the Provincial Department of Education in conjunction with the regional agricultural and industrial colleges, as well as agricultural and industrial experimental and improvement agencies. Economic and construction agencies in each region shall, within the possible scope, plan various small factories or farms in accordance with local needs, closely cooperate with the local vocational schools, and recruit apprentices for training in the factories and farms. Agricultural and industrial construction and education cooperation matters in each region shall be promoted by the president of the agricultural and industrial college, jointly with the directors of the provincial departments of education and construction, and the chiefs of the relevant departments, and the directors of agricultural and industrial experimental and improvement agencies. The implementation plan for each region shall be completed within three years.</p>
<p>Northwest Region: "Current Situation" It is found that the region has established the National Northwest Institute of Technology and the National Northwest Agricultural College, which can assume the responsibility of guiding agricultural and industrial education and technology in the region. However, the vocational schools in each province are not very developed. Shaanxi Province has 4 industrial schools and 3 agricultural schools. Gansu Province has 2 industrial schools and 1 agricultural school. Ningxia Province has 1 junior vocational training institute. Qinghai Province has 1 agricultural school and 1 industrial school. "Improvement Plan" The region is inconvenienced by transportation, and industrial production is extremely backward. Even in agriculture, it sticks to old methods and does not know how to improve. It is now planned to establish one senior agricultural and industrial vocational school each in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces in addition to reorganizing the existing schools. The industrial school will offer four courses: mechanical engineering, civil engineering, textile engineering, and applied chemistry. The agricultural school will offer three courses: agronomy, animal husbandry, and forestry. In addition, junior vocational schools or training courses in various subjects will be planned at appropriate locations.</p>
<p>Four schools in each province. In Ningxia and Qinghai provinces, in addition to reorganizing the existing schools, one senior industrial and agricultural vocational school each will be established. The agricultural school will offer three courses: agronomy, animal husbandry, and forestry. The industrial school will offer courses in mechanical engineering and applied chemistry. Junior practical vocational schools will be planned in each county, two in each province. The locations and all plans for the establishment of the above-mentioned schools in each province shall be formulated in detail by the provincial departments of education and construction, in conjunction with the National Northwest Agricultural and Industrial College, and agricultural improvement agencies, in accordance with local conditions, and submitted to the ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>World Student League Leaders Come to China to Investigate Wartime Education</h3>
<p>Duke and Derling Arrive in China One After Another, McKee Will Give a Speech in Shanghai on the 19th</p>
<p>The World Student League is an organization organized by students from all over the world. The General Committee held a meeting in France in August last year. Those who attended from our country include representatives Gu Ziren, Jiang Wenhan, and Shi Baozhen. A total of more than 100 people attended the meeting. At the meeting, meticulous instructions were given on academic cultivation, social transformation, international relations, and appropriate educational work. In December of the same year, the League Leadership Conference was held in India, and Chinese representatives also attended and participated. The conference also sent Mr. Duke to China to assume the post of Director-General of the Far East Region. Mr. Duke has arrived and is currently residing in Hong Kong to start work. In order to understand the situation of our country's war of resistance and the state of wartime education, the League also sent Mr. McKee and Ms. Derling, the Director-General of the League, to China to conduct on-site inspections in various places. Ms. Derling has arrived in Shanghai and has now set off to Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming and other places to conduct on-site inspections. Mr. McKee has also set off and will arrive before the 19th of this month. He is scheduled to give a public speech at the German Church on Da Xi Road on that day, and then leave Shanghai to work in the inland.</p>
<h3>University of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Added Industrial Chemistry Group</p>
<p>Since the spring of this year, the University of Shanghai has established the Institute of Applied Chemistry, and the Chemistry Tea of the Faculty of Science has added the Industrial Chemistry Group to cultivate specialized skilled talents. In addition to the basic disciplines of the Chemistry Department, the group's curriculum adds advanced applied chemistry, (pigments, inks, gasoline, lubricating oil, catalysts, etc.) advanced organic chemistry, (dyes, spices, colloids and artificial fuels, etc.) brewing science, (yeast, alcohol, soy sauce, glucose, etc.) industrial analysis, (water, oil, coal, minerals, pigments, etc.) applied electrochemistry, (electroplating, electroforming, dry batteries, storage batteries, electrochemical industry, etc.) and actively expands equipment. Now many industrial manufacturing and analysis laboratories have been added, and a special chemical reference library has been established, equipped with industrial chemistry books and complete sets of medical, English and German chemical journals, which are sufficient for the research of various disciplines of the Chemistry Tea and the Institute of Applied Chemistry.

<p>School Overview</p>
<h3>Da Gong Vocational School</h3>
<p>Da Gong Vocational School was founded by Mr. Lin Meiyan. It adheres to the principles of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China, implements production education, imparts vocational skills, and fosters values such as propriety, knowledge, righteousness, patriotism, and community spirit. It was established in June of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). A plot of over 40 mu was purchased on Jumen Road to construct spacious school buildings, practical workshops, banks, shops, and physics and chemistry laboratories. In May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), it was approved for registration by the Education Bureau. In August of the same year, the new buildings were fully completed, with departments for senior and junior high school, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, commerce, general studies, and other ordinary subjects. The student population has reached over a thousand. The management and teaching are earnest, and the facilities are excellent, earning widespread praise from people both domestically and abroad. In the spring of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), it received a subsidy of 15,000 yuan from the Ministry of Education to enhance the equipment in each department, further improving its scale and completeness. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Incident in the 26th year of the Republic (1937), a portion of the school relocated to Chongqing, establishing a branch school. Over 400 mu of land were acquired in Xiaolongkan, in the northwest corner of Chongqing, to build school buildings and establish factories. In August of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), it enrolled five or six hundred students, with classes officially beginning in mid-October. The Shanghai school was then moved to Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Due to the impact of the war, it experienced some decline. In August of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), it relocated again to Jiangxi Road in the International Settlement, striving to expand and reorganize. The student population increased to around 500, and the existing school buildings became insufficient. It has now moved to Qingyun Building at 131 Hankou Road. Shi Duhui has been appointed as the vice-principal and head of the commerce department, Chen Xiyuan as the director of academic affairs and head of the mechanical engineering department, Xu Chao as the director of student affairs and head of the general studies department, and Yuan Zemeng as the head of the civil engineering department. The faculty in each department are all university graduates with profound academic knowledge and rich experience. Since its inception, six years ago, students have graduated three times. Graduates from the general studies department mostly pursue further education, while graduates from the vocational departments mostly work in factories, banks, and railways.</p>
<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Min Guang Middle School: Min Guang Middle School, located at 2 Yuyuan Road, Jiaozhou Road intersection, is known for its earnest dedication to education and outstanding academic results. Therefore, the school adopts strict assessments of students' academic performance and conduct, with clear rewards and punishments. Each semester, a significant number of students are held back or dismissed due to poor academic performance or conduct. However, for students with excellent conduct and academic performance, in addition to receiving certificates of merit, there are also scholarship provisions. It is understood that students ranked first in academic performance and conduct in each grade receive free tuition, those ranked second receive a silver shield, and those ranked third receive a certificate of merit. Furthermore, one student with the best academic performance is selected from both the senior and junior high school departments to receive a full tuition waiver as encouragement.</p>
<p>Shi Cheng Middle School: Since Mr. Xing Pengju took office as the principal of Private Shi Cheng Middle School, he has worked diligently. On January 15th, the school received Instruction No. 286 from the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education stationed in Shanghai, approving the school's application for establishment and the registration of the board of directors. The school is now actively expanding and has allocated a substantial sum of money to construct a new four-story building on the vacant land of the current school site for use as dormitories, a library, and a physics and chemistry laboratory. The construction is now complete, and a large number of books and instruments are being purchased. In the next semester, in addition to the original teachers, including Shi Zhefu, Zhang Linshi, Zai Dongxin, Bao Yuke, Lu Zhongying, Zhuang Menghao, Ke Liyi, Xie Changsheng, Tang Tao, Gui Shuchao, Zheng Miansan, Sun Junzai, Song Junpei, and Zheng Shaocheng, new teachers such as Yu Mingli, Wang Shiti, Xie Daren, Tong Zhikan, Tan Guanying, and Liu Hanxi have been hired.

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Fear Not Slow, Fear Only Stop</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlü</p>
<p>Two weeks of vacation have quietly slipped away. Now it is the beginning of a new semester, and the children are going back to school with their schoolbags, resuming their school life.</p>
<p>Children! In your studies at school, do not be arrogant because you are talented and neglect your studies; nor be discouraged because you are dull. Those who are willing to study hard are the ones who will win in the end. The saying "Fear not slow, fear only stop!" means just that.</p>
<p>The story of "The Tortoise and the Hare" is one that everyone has heard. Although the tortoise crawls slowly, it is able to persevere and keep moving forward, so it wins. Although the hare runs very fast, it thinks it runs well and is unwilling to work hard, dozing off midway, and as a result, it fails.</p>
<p>This is a good lesson for us: Smart children, quickly use the hare as a warning. Intelligence is not reliable. If you rely on your intelligence and do not know how to work hard, you will inevitably fail. Dull children, encourage yourselves with the tortoise. Dullness is not a problem, as long as you are willing to work hard continuously, you may succeed in the end.</p>
<p>Historically, there have been many ancient people with slow aptitudes who, because of their determination to study diligently, without fear of difficulties or discouragement, ultimately achieved astonishing things. But there are also countless geniuses who are unwilling to work hard and stop halfway, so they remain unknown.</p>
<p>Respectable children! Keep in mind: "Fear not slow, fear only stop!" Strive for your future, and do not stop your progress. The destination is approaching you!</p>
<h3>The Clock and Galileo</h3>
<p>— Third Brother</p>
<p>The clock—it tells us when to get up, tells us when to go to school, it also tells us when to go to bed. We cannot leave it for a day, we cannot but listen to its command for a moment. How useful it is to us! Since it is so closely useful to us, we cannot not know how it was produced and the interesting story of its father.</p>
<p>Galileo was an Italian scientist, born in 1564 and died in 1642. His contributions to the scientific community in his lifetime are countless.</p>
<p>One day, he was attending mass in the Pisa Cathedral. He looked up and saw a small lamp hanging on the wall, swaying back and forth incessantly. Out of curiosity, he stared blankly at it, continuing to stare until everyone had finished mass and gone home. He still stood foolishly under the wall, looking at it incessantly, and from time to time pressing his own pulse with his hand, counting numbers like "one, two, three, four" in his mouth. The officiating priest thought he had gone mad and wanted to chase him out, but he suddenly laughed and ran home as if flying.</p>
<p>On the road, he said with a grin, "Got it, got it!" The priest was startled by him.</p>
<p>A few days later, he made a device and published an article. This device is the ancestor of all clocks today. The device is very simple, exactly the same principle as the lamp in the cathedral. His article said: "When I found that the clock swung left and right once, my pulse beat twice, I decided that the time of the swing is constant. Great, we will have a tool to calculate time in the future."</p>
<p>Of course, Galileo's clock is not as accurate and beautiful as the ones hanging on the walls and desks in the children's homes, but if he had not noticed that small lamp at the time, then perhaps we would still not have a tool to calculate time.</p>
<h3>How to Speak</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>Words represent people's thoughts. To understand the temperament of a new friend you have never met, you mostly inquire from their speech. If they speak humorously, you know they are an interesting person; if they speak passively and without energy, you know they are pessimistic; if they speak crudely, you know they have not received education. In short, a person's character and talent are mostly revealed in their speech. At the same time, speaking is to people. Because it is to people, sometimes it makes people smile, sometimes it makes people's eyes crack, sometimes it makes people laugh and cry. Speaking can really make people's faces change unpredictably. Therefore, speaking is both an expression of one's personality and a way to establish relationships with others. Children must pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>First, do not criticize people—people inevitably have faults, and everyone may not be without faults themselves. However, people often cannot see their own faults, but only judge the faults of others. Such people are too narrow-minded, and their own faults will never be repented. I hope that children will first correct their own mistakes, and then, in addition to not criticizing people behind their backs, have the courage to advise them to their faces.</p>
<p>Second, be honest—Some children often take deceiving as a pleasure, to the point of becoming a bad habit. It leaves a bad impression in people's minds, so that even true words will not be believed by others. Therefore, children suffering from this problem, please reform immediately. The way to reform is to be very honest in telling teachers or parents about things that have been done wrong. You may be punished at the time, but they will change their attitude toward your words.</p>
<p>Third, be consistent in word and deed—That is, be able to do what you say. The general problem of Chinese people is that they can say it, but they cannot do it. These people are nothing more than considering the success or failure of the cause, and not having the determination. In fact, the success or failure of the cause lies in the key of doing it or not doing it.</p>
<p>Fourth, do not gossip—The colloquialism is to move your tongue. Most disputes between people arise because a third party wants to please one side. This kind of situation often happens in schools. I hope that children will not do this kind of uneducated behavior. If there are disagreements between classmates, you should mediate to make them still as friendly as usual. This is your responsibility.</p>
<h3>What Is the Shape of an Iceberg?</h3>
<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>Children, is your mind constantly speculating?</p>
<p>When you see frozen water surfaces or silvery-white scenes outdoors in cold weather, low temperatures, or heavy snowfall, if your mind is full of ideals, then you will definitely think of the icebergs in the polar and frigid zones! And generate all sorts of imaginary shapes.</p>
<p>What exactly is the shape of an iceberg? Now let me tell you, this may supplement the lack of knowledge you have gained in textbooks.</p>
<p>Ordinary ice floes floating on the ocean can be divided into two major categories, sea ice and land ice, depending on their formation. Icebergs belong to the land ice category. Icebergs are usually mixed with ice floes floating on extremely cold oceans. Their formation is different from sea ice. Greenland and Spitsbergen islands within the Arctic Circle and the Antarctic continent are all places covered with snow all year round. Because of the perennial snowfall, the accumulated snow becomes increasingly dense, and as a result, it turns into ice. This ice naturally has considerable weight, and there is also accumulated ice behind it. Once it is layered on top, pressure is generated, squeezing downward. The ice below is squeezed and slowly slides from high places to the coast along the sloping surface of the land. The speed at which it slides can generally be several meters to dozens of meters per day. When the iceberg reaches the coast, due to the increase in buoyancy of the seawater, or under the impact of huge waves, the entire ice layer is often cut off and scattered, floating on the ocean. This is the origin of icebergs!</p>
<p>The icebergs on the Arctic sea surface are all formed on land. Their shape is not fixed. Because their surface is attached with sand and rocks, they show deep cyan stripes. Their length on the water surface ranges from several meters to several miles, and the height above the water surface ranges from two meters to four hundred and fifty meters, so they can be said to be a very large type of land ice!</p>
<p>The icebergs in Antarctica are not all formed from ice blocks flowing down from valleys, as are the Arctic icebergs. They are all formed on vast ice sheets, so their shape is very flat and wide. The general height is below fifty meters, but their width is extremely wide. Icebergs with a width of one to two thousand meters are often three to four nautical miles, or even fifty to sixty nautical miles long. The most unique feature of Antarctic icebergs is that their tops are flat and broad, looking like ice-frozen dikes from a distance!</p>
<p>The specific gravity of ice is 0.92, and the specific gravity of seawater is 1.027. Therefore, according to the specific gravity calculation, the depth of the part of the iceberg below the water surface should be nine times the height of the part above the water surface, but in reality, the part below the water surface is only six or seven times the part above the water surface. For example, for an iceberg that is one hundred meters high above the water surface, the part below the water surface is probably only six or seven hundred meters deep.</p>
<p>Icebergs drift with the wind on the ocean surface. Under the irradiation of sunlight, the destruction of waves, and the erosion of warm currents, they become various strange shapes. Some look like rows of castles, some look like crouching beasts, and some look like towering mountain peaks, which is extremely spectacular! After drifting for many days, icebergs gradually melt, and the parts above the water surface break off separately, sometimes even emitting a huge sound. When an iceberg collapses, it is very dangerous if a ship passes by it!</p>
<p>Although the scenery of icebergs is majestic and extraordinary, many ships and creatures are destroyed and perish because of them. For example, the British iron steamer Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. From this, we can know that an iceberg is a white, magnificent, and terrifying thing!</p>
<h3>A Scene of an Arctic Iceberg</h3>

<h3>Passing Through the Wharf (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>Ming'er's Refugee Diary, Number Thirteen</p>
<p>At that time, it was already past eight o'clock in the evening, and the shops on the street had closed their doors. Ming'er and his older brother, Cong'er, were sitting together in a rickshaw, one of more than ten rickshaws heading mightily toward the Jianggan (Riverbank) area. Ming'er felt very strange; why were those shops closing so early and not doing business? He asked his brother, Cong. The rickshaw puller answered instead, "There have been air raid alarms all day long for the past few days. The rich people have already run away. Yesterday there were eleven alarms, making it difficult for us to do business. You are really lucky today; there haven't been any alarms all day long." Ming'er realized that Hangzhou was not the paradise he had imagined.</p>
<p>It took a full hour, passing through who knows how many streets and alleys, twisting and turning, before they arrived at the Guotanghang (Wharf) in Jianggan. The lights on the Qiantang River were reflected on the mirror-like surface of the river, which was truly beautiful. They hurried inside.</p>
<p>The Guotanghang was very large, piled with who knows how many large and small packages of goods. There were many people inside, standing, sitting, old, young, all kinds of people, gathered in one room. When Ming'er and the others walked in, everyone stared at each other, and it suddenly became quiet. They were all refugees with the same fate as Ming'er. Later, they began to talk, and Ming'er listened quietly.</p>
<p>"Where did you come from? Where are you planning to go now?" A young woman, with a yellowish, slightly sorrowful face, showed a slight smile as she asked Ming'er's mother.</p>
<p>"We came from Wuzhen to Hangzhou, which took three days. We are now thinking of going to Tunxi. What about you?" Ming'er's mother replied.</p>
<p>"We came from Jiaxing. We arrived in Hangzhou the day before yesterday, but we couldn't find a boat. We've been staying here for more than a day. We want to go to Lanxi, but it's really hard to find a boat. Even if we offer a good price, it's not easy to find one." She sighed and continued, "Yesterday was really frightening. More than twenty silver-gray airplanes came and dropped dozens of bombs outside Hangzhou City. There was even a bomb that tried to blow up the Qiantang River Iron Bridge, but the bridge wasn't destroyed. Instead, more than ten small boats near the Iron Bridge were sunk. The sound of the explosion shook the ground here. It was so terrible." After the woman finished speaking, the conversation temporarily subsided.</p>

<h3>The Great Iron</h3>
<p>— Lu Dazhi, Grade 5, Guangji Elementary School</p>
<p>Among metals such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin, who would have thought that "iron" is the greatest of all metals?</p>
<p>Everyone knows the most common uses of "iron," right? Making all kinds of knives, pots, shovels, scissors. We even eat rice because of iron! Believe it? Let me tell you: Rice is cooked from rice grains, and to cook rice, you need an "iron" pot, right? And rice? It's grown by farmers, and farmers need an iron hoe and an "iron" plow to farm... So isn't eating rice also reliant on "iron"? Furthermore, wearing clothes also relies on "iron." Clothes are sewn from cloth, and sewing cloth requires an "iron" needle, so isn't clothing also reliant on "iron"? By this reasoning, houses and roads are also made possible by "iron"!</p>
<p>Now, the weapons used in wartime are all made of "iron," such as guns, armored vehicles, broadswords, cannons, and airplanes.</p>
<p>In this light, isn't iron more important than gold, silver, copper, tin...? Now that you know the greatness of iron, you can say that the world today is a world of iron.</p>

<h3>School Begins</h3>
<p>— Ma Yuanyong, Grade 6, Zhendong Elementary School</p>
<p>The short winter vacation has passed in the blink of an eye. After two weeks apart, we are holding an opening ceremony again. Many children, after being separated for two weeks, can now gather together day and night. We are truly fortunate to be able to receive a proper education in these extraordinary times, to nurture our minds and bodies. Now, education on the isolated island has entered an abnormal state, and parents spend a lot of hard-earned money to send us to school. We should strive to improve ourselves, so that the money our parents have taken out is not wasted. Moreover, the country is in a time of great difficulty, and we are in urgent need of revitalizing the Chinese nation. The responsibility on our shoulders is not light, and we should always cultivate a good foundation, so that we can live up to our country and our parents.</p>
<h3>The Rooster's Crow in the Morning</h3>
<p>— Li Lanzhen, Grade 6, Minqi Elementary School</p>
<p>I was sleeping in bed in the morning, when the rooster's crowing woke me up. I got up, opened the window, and saw the beautiful sun just rising from the horizon. Then I washed my face, ate some breakfast, and sat on the sofa to read a few pages of a book. After reading for a while, I went to school, and the time for class hadn't arrived yet.</p>
<p>At this moment, I thought to myself that this small rooster not only gets up early itself, but can also wake us up. How admirable!</p>
<p>But it is always so energetic every day. If we young people cannot invigorate ourselves to do things, then we are not even as good as a rooster.</p>
<h3>New Year Cake</h3>
<p>— Gu Yueying, Grade 6, Former Qiming Elementary School</p>
<p>The time is approaching the end of the lunar calendar. Lately, the streets have begun to change into a new look. As soon as you open your eyes, the new embellishment—New Year cake—will surely make you feel sweet in your heart.</p>
<p>But this year, not only can I not feel the sweetness of the past, but it also increases my infinite sadness!</p>
<p>Remembering the matter of eating New Year cake is sweet enough! Every winter vacation, I would return to my hometown with my older brother. My grandmother would always take time out of her busy schedule to make New Year cake. At that time, I would always stand beside her, watching happily. When my grandmother handed me the New Year cake made from the new rice flour of my hometown and I began to chew it happily, the fragrant and sweet taste made me forget everything.</p>
<p>Now? After the fall of my hometown, I can no longer eat the New Year cake! Even the home and school in Zhabei have been destroyed by artillery fire. Who gave this to us? I deeply remember that I don't want to eat the New Year cake on the isolated island now. I want to eat the New Year cake after my hometown is restored.</p>
<h3>Older Brother, Younger Sister——Catching Sparrows</h3>

<p>(1) The older brother and younger sister went out to play together. They saw many sparrows flying and gathering on the tree. The younger sister wanted to catch them, but couldn't.</p>
<p>(2) The older brother built a small house with bricks, topped it with a brick, and put a handful of rice underneath.</p>
<p>(3) The two hid far away, waiting for the sparrows to come down to eat the rice. When they pulled the string, the sparrows were caught.</p>
<p>(4) They were very happy to have caught so many sparrows.</p>
<h3>Snow White (7)</h3>
<p>— Grandchild of Heaven</p>
<p>The stubborn old man scolded, "Are you trying to blow away that ghostly thing with those sneezing fits?" Just then, the wealthy man heard a strange sound from upstairs, piercing their ears. It turned out that Snow White had yawned and was beginning to wake up from her sleep.</p>
<p>The doctor, trembling, pointed upstairs, saying, "Over there, in that bedroom, it must be. I think someone should rush upstairs and chase it down."</p>
<p>The little mute's face brightened instantly. He thought it was a great idea and would be good to do. He nodded enthusiastically to show his agreement. However, when he saw all six of his companions staring intently at his face, he stopped nodding.</p>
<p>Poor little mute! Seeing this, he understood perfectly well that the six of them had chosen him to do it. He was a very timid person and was almost scared to pieces. He wanted to find a way to refuse and let someone else do it, but the doctor had already shoved a candle into his trembling hand, leaving him no chance to refuse. Helpless, he had to brace himself and cautiously climbed the stairs, sneaking towards the dark bedroom, his teeth chattering.</p>
<p>He cautiously pushed open the door and peeked in. Unexpectedly, Snow White happened to stretch out her arms and lift the white sheet high, looking like a ghost about to pounce. The little mute was so frightened that his soul flew away. He used all the speed of his little legs, running desperately down the stairs, using various gestures (because he was mute and had never been able to speak) to report to his six companions that the ghost was lying on their bed sleeping. Upon receiving this report, they dared not delay. They gathered their courage, put the hoes on their shoulders, and tiptoed upstairs.</p>
<p>The doctor whispered to his companions, "Get ready, everyone. When I pull off the sheet, strike down with the hoes and kill it!"</p>
<p>The six dwarfs quickly raised their hoes, waiting. The doctor stepped forward and quickly reached out to pull off the sheet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they all cried out in unison. The seven hoes unknowingly dropped to the ground, and the seven pairs of eyes unknowingly widened, growing wider and wider. The seven mouths unknowingly opened, growing bigger and bigger. These seven dwarfs had lived for hundreds of years and had never seen such a beautiful woman!</p>
<p>Sleepy mumbled, "Doctor, what—what's going on?"</p>
<p>Sneezy exhaled and said, "This is really beautiful!"</p>
<p>Bashful, also lowering his voice, praised softly, "So beautiful—really like a heavenly fairy!"</p>
<p>The stubborn old man sniffed and said, "Humph! As I see it, this is definitely a lot of trouble. I absolutely do not approve."</p>
<p>Happy asked, "Doctor, what exactly is this?"</p>
<p>The doctor stammered, "What, what, I think this is a girl. Yes, definitely, this is a girl."</p>
<p>The dwarfs all asked curiously, "This is a girl? What do we do? She has taken up three of our beds."</p>
<p>The old man grumbled unhappily, "If it's a girl, it would be better if it were a corpse!"</p>
<p>The doctor quickly said, "How can you say that! She won't harm us!"</p>
<p>"Shh, be quiet! She's waking up!"</p>
<p>In the previous two installments of this article, the words "鐵劃" (iron strokes) and "鐵鐘" (iron bell) should be changed to "鋤頭" (hoe).</p>

<h3>The Doctrine of "Reimbursability"</h3>
<p>— Lishi</p>
<p>The doctrine of "reimbursability" was very popular in China in the past.</p>
<p>As long as students could read, they could "reimburse" the school authorities, and the school authorities could "reimburse" the students' parents. As for whether reading led to understanding principles, the school authorities and students' families could ignore it.</p>
<p>As long as managers had profitable accounts, they could "reimburse" the board of directors, and the board of directors could "reimburse" the shareholders' meeting. As for the actual business situation, profits were booked even if there were bad debts, and losses were not booked even if they existed. The board of directors and the shareholders' meeting could ignore it.</p>
<p>As long as political workers had work reports, they could "reimburse" their superiors, and their superiors could "reimburse" the government. As for whether the work reports were factual and whether the work progress was appropriate, the superiors and the government were too lazy to inquire.</p>
<p>Because of this, all academics, all businesses, and all politics were stagnant and unable to advance.</p>
<p>However, it must be said that proponents of "reimbursability" also had their unavoidable difficulties. Students used literacy as "reimbursability" to appease their parents' cultivation, managers used false profitable accounts as "reimbursability" to avoid shareholders' accusations, and political workers used grand work reports as "reimbursability" to ward off others' attacks. Therefore, although the doctrine of "reimbursability" hindered all progress in China, it also saved the fate of all those with base intentions.</p>
<p>Our friendly neighbor to the east is remarkably clever. Its history of modernization is a record of absorbing world civilization. Now, as a result of its invasion of China, it has encountered great difficulties and has also adopted the doctrine of "reimbursability."</p>
<p>As a result of the eastern neighbor's nineteen months of war, it has sacrificed 700,000 soldiers and lost 8 billion in its national treasury. It now feels that troop replenishment is difficult, its economy is extremely strained, and its international situation is isolated. Therefore, anti-war sentiment within the country is growing daily, and suicides due to war-weariness are increasing daily. The entire Japanese population is deeply dissatisfied with the current situation. When the Japanese military could not make progress in the war of aggression against China and its political conspiracies were failing, it had no choice but to occupy Hainan Island in order to provide "reimbursability" to its domestic population. Look: Tokyo is loudly boasting that the occupation of Hainan Island, which has no coastal defense, is a "surprise attack." Isn't this deceiving the domestic population and using it for "reimbursability"?</p>
<p>The doctrine of "reimbursability," which is about to die out in the new China that has grown up in the war of resistance, is now having the opportunity to grow in a Japan that is declining and collapsing!</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Theater World</h3>
<p>— Qu Shigong</p>
<p>Lu Si, with his shaggy hair and thick beard, was unmistakable.</p>
<p>He feared getting haircuts most of all. He said that barbershops were like Western-style detention centers, where he would lose an hour of freedom—freedom of movement—once he stepped inside.</p>
<p>When his hair grew long and his beard grew long, he didn't care. He said that it was in line with "natural beauty."</p>
<p>When it became too long, he would often be forced into the barbershop by his friend M. In fact, he never voluntarily went to get a haircut.</p>
<p>Because of his long hair and beard, many jokes had been made. The biggest was seven or eight years ago when he was still studying at Fudan University. The female students, upon seeing him, would always discuss his age, guessing that he was at least over forty years old. Actually, he hadn't even turned thirty yet.</p>
<p>Enough idle talk, let's talk about two or three of his "twelve embarrassing events."</p>
<p>One night four or five years ago, Lu Si was in the editorial office of the Min Bao when a strange guest suddenly arrived. He rushed in, saying angrily, "Are you planning to return the electric fan you borrowed?"</p>
<p>"What electric fan? I haven't borrowed one," Lu Si replied.</p>
<p>"Are you Mr. Li... (Lu Si)?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my name is Li... (Lu Si); but I haven't borrowed a fan from anyone."</p>
<p>"Yes, you did, last summer."</p>
<p>"Do you know the person with the surname Li...?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't. He asked someone with the surname Zhou to borrow it for you, saying that you were using it to film a movie—'Tear Stains.'"</p>
<p>At this point, Lu Si sighed and realized that he had found the wrong person: it was Lu Shi, with the surname Hou.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1933, the "Era Theater Troupe" participated in the recreational activity of Chizhi University and performed "June 23rd." You Jing played the mother, and Zhang Jianfen played his daughter. Everyone had already put on makeup. In a split second before going on stage, Ms. Zhang suddenly took off her headscarf and said to Lu Si—who was the director of "June 23rd"—"I don't want to perform anymore! Look how dark they made my face with makeup, it's too embarrassing!"</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Lu Si's eloquence was very poor. At this moment, he was so embarrassed that he couldn't say a word. Later, thanks to Yun Jing's persuasion, Lu Si's embarrassment was resolved.</p>
<p>It was also four or five years ago. One morning, he and Ling He watched the "test film" and came out of the Jincheng Grand Theater. Ling He said to him, "Today, I'll treat you to a dinner," so the two walked to a restaurant on Fourth Avenue, ordered a pound of wine, and toasted happily. After finishing the meal, when it was time to pay the bill, Ling He realized that he had forgotten to bring money. At this time, Lu Si only had twenty cents in his pocket, which was, of course, another embarrassment.</p>
<p>Due to space constraints, that's all for now.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Art Exhibition (Difficulties in Moving Remuneration for Donations)</h3>
<h3>Mr. Li Gou's Cat</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>Mr. Li lives in Huangye Building in Huajing, Shanghai County. The building is located in the northeast of the town and is extremely old, built during the Ming Dynasty. High walls surround it, all planted with creeping fig. Bamboo of filial piety is planted in the courtyard. In spring and summer, the green trees are lush and the winding corridors are quite serene and elegant. The building houses a rich collection of books. When Mr. Li is in the wilderness, he always lives here to write books and study academic subjects. He is addicted to antiques and can hardly part with fragmented and incomplete texts, all of which he treasures. One summer of the Republic of China, the Twenty-Four Histories were suddenly gnawed by mice, and several pages of the History of Liao were lost. He was very saddened by this, so he raised a tabby cat whose colors were mottled like a tiger. Mr. Li loved it very much. Every meal, it would kneel beside the table, eating when given food, and not snatching when not given. From then on, the plague of mice was eradicated. The following year, it gave birth to two cubs, which were larger than ordinary cats. Before the cubs could eat rice, the mother cat suddenly fell ill and died in a few days. Mr. Li actually burst into tears and collapsed afterward. At that time, Mr. Yao Yuan, Mr. Yao Yuan, had two poems for the cat, including the line "Empty expense of two inches of fish for morning meals." Later, the family members took good care of the two cubs. As the cubs grew older, they also depended on their master and stayed close to him, so when he was free from writing, he often used the cats as entertainment. When Mr. Li traveled far to the capital and took charge of Peking University, family reports also inquired about his beloved cats from time to time. These cats are of the fifth generation, and one still remains. Last autumn, during the refuge in Shanghai, he did not bring them with him, and Mr. Li also misses them from time to time. Now it is gone. Mr. Li died worrying about the country. I wonder if these cats can still remember their master.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Gou is Mr. Liu San. Mr. Li was proud and had clean sleeves all his life. Now that Mr. Li has returned to the mountains, his family has almost nothing to rely on. He wants to submit articles to make a living. I think Mr. Li knows the world well. Now, reading the article by his wife, Ai Li, I can't help but feel sad and think of the feelings of plain linen in his life.</p>
<p>Editor's Note</p>
<h3>Elastic Lover</h3>
<p>— Rú Huá</p>
<p>"Too Hot to Handle"</p>
<p>A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Production, Shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater</p>
<p>After watching "Elastic Lover", the most regrettable thing is the failure of the screenplay. "Newsreel companies from all over the United States send specialists to capture important news from around the world, competing with each other to obtain exclusive news" is a fact. And the photographers braving fire and water, risking their lives to shoot newsreels, are also a fact. Taking such real material to write a screenplay, as long as a certain motive is seized, the two points mentioned above - that is, the theme - can be developed. Just like the first half of "Elastic Lover", whether expressed in the form of comedy or tragedy, it can be very moving. But after "Gabe obtains the film taken by Hunter in Shanghai, and it is shown at a reception, exposing the matter, and Alma's reputation is suddenly damaged", the screenwriter of this film may have been too eager to win, and in the second half of the film, suddenly started another stove, and released it from a horizontal stabbing. Although he inserted many thrilling scenes, this waist-cut writing destroyed the unity of the whole play, and also destroyed the emotions of the whole play.</p>
<p>The director of this film, Jack Conway, is an expert in directing comedies. At the beginning of the film, the companies compete to shoot newsreels; Bill designs; Alma comes to Shanghai by plane; Hunter risks his life to rescue: he uses short film, the fastest tone, and step by step, to introduce the two most important characters in the film, which is very lovely. In the second half of the film, due to the limitations of the screenplay, he just tried his best on the fragments.</p>
<p>For example, after Alma and Hunter arrived in a small town, they saw a native wearing Harding's (Alma's brother) watch. When Hunter and his assistant went to the voodoo village to visit Harding, Hunter wanted to kill the natives but was escaped by him; the voodoo village's ceremony; - a special screening of the newsreel scared away the natives; Hunter hugged Harding and wanted to leave, but the boat by the river had disappeared. The director used the natives' revelry, music, to accompany Hunter and his assistant's emotions, and the tight editing of the screening of the newsreel and the natives' shock, all showed Jack Conway's superb directing skills.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning is the photography of this film. Alma piloting the plane, Hunter filming the explosion of the sea ship on the plane, although some of the close-ups can see the model of the flight and the sea ship, but the capture of those medium shots, and when Ai Jianma saved Harding and left the voodoo village by plane. Hunter grabbed the plane and refused to let go, Bill fired a shot, the camera was placed on the right side of the plane, watching the small boat after Tingte let go rushing straight down in the waves, this can not help but make people feel the lack of material conditions in the Chinese photography field.</p>
<p>There is also a section in the film that writes about the war in Shanghai. According to friends, there are scenes of airplane bombing and Hunter's encounter with danger, but after the planes fly by in formation on the screen, it connects to the scene of Hunter taking fake planes. This is probably sacrificed under the scissors of "this time and this place". But from this, it can also be seen that the screenwriter is trying to capture the material as much as possible, and writing "Elastic Lover" into a "mixed vegetable" story.</p>
<p>Clark Gable's Hunter and Mauna Loa's Alma are both working hard, and Ward Connalley, who plays Gabe, is also successful.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 4 Recalling the Past, Happy Heaven Transmits Wonderful Words, Makes New Friends, and Visits Scenic Spots for Pure Pleasure</p>
<p>It is said that the two Miss He sisters took the guest-sending limousine from the inn and arrived at the North Railway Station. The train tickets were bought in advance by the inn, so there was no need to go to the train station to buy them again. The two ladies' luggage was very simple, each with a small suitcase, which contained nothing more than a few personal clothes. They originally came to Shanghai by plane, so naturally they could not bring much luggage on the plane. Even the suitcase was made of lightweight materials, specially for use on airplanes. The train was scheduled to depart at nine o'clock, and they arrived at the station at eight o'clock, and saw that there were many people taking the train. Shuang Yu then said to Li Yu, "Look at so many people taking the train, I'm afraid we won't be able to find Wu Junsu from yesterday." Li Yu said, "If we can't find her, there's nothing we can do. Anyway, when we get to Suzhou, even if she doesn't greet us, we can take care of ourselves." Who knew that they had just arrived on the platform when they heard someone shouting from afar. "Sister He! Why did you only come now!" Looking closely, it was Wu Junsu. It turned out that Wu Junsu had arrived earlier than them. She looked in the carriage and did not see the He sisters. She knew that they must not have arrived yet, so she stood on the platform waiting for them. Now she saw them coming from afar, so she hurriedly greeted them. The current train system is quite different from before the war. First, before the war, the trains were divided into countless levels. There were first-class cars, second-class cars, and third-class cars, but that didn't matter. And below the third-class cars, there were also fourth-class cars, called: Poor people, workers, and small foremen. The person who created the evil fourth-class car may have been out of good intentions, thinking that the price of sitting in a fourth-class car would be much cheaper. Although the facilities and treatment were a little worse, the speed was still the same. But because there were several classes of cars, it seemed that humans were also clearly divided into several classes. With fourth-class cars, it seems that there is a fourth class of people, who should be the fourth class of people? If you want to benefit the general public, can't you just reduce the train fare in general? Often, first-class cars were considered the highest class, but above first-class cars, there were also flower cars. And even there were some government officials, national elders, who specially opened special cars. Now there are no special cars, even if there are important people and important things, wouldn't they take a plane? Flower cars, that kind of aristocratic train, are also rare, unless it is for entertaining foreign guests, funded by the government, and a section is chartered. For example, when ambassadors from various countries come to the National Government to meet the chairman and present their credentials, they bring many counselors and secretaries, etc., so the National Diplomatic Committee must charter a section of the train for them. This is not called a flower car, but simply a chartered car for welcoming guests. (37)</p>

<p>The World of Entertainment</p>
<h3>The Entertainment Industry in Occupied Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Wei Xiu</p>
<p>Kun Opera Since Suzhou fell under occupation, the entertainment industry has presented a kind of deformed development. It began with the Kun opera of the Xianni Society, which borrowed the site of the Yúcái Elementary School of Xuanmiao Temple as a theater. Ticket prices were divided into one mao and five fen and two mao, and they staged continuous full-length good plays. The performance was serious and continued for as long as three months. Many people in Suzhou understand Kun opera, and many can hum a few lines, so the business was really not bad. Later, it was hired by the Shanghai Oriental Bookstore before it ended its performance.</p>
<p>Beijing Opera There are three theaters for Beijing Opera: Kaiming, Dongwu, and Jincheng. Kaiming is in the North Bureau of the city, and the various agencies and scenery were not damaged at all in the war, so it opened the earliest. Dongwu is on Hengma Road in Changmen. Part of the gate and the backstage were destroyed. It has now been slightly repaired and opened. Jincheng is on Shilu Road in Changmen, and it rents several large rooms in a flat house and reluctantly sets up a stage for performance. Kaiming and Jincheng each performed Journey to the West, and Dongwu performed Honglian Temple, competing with each other in the scenery of the agencies. Dongwu also used the "Girls' Dance Troupe" to attract people. The ticket prices are not out of the range of one mao and two mao. Kaiming has the best business, Dongwu is second, and Jincheng is worse, but generally they can all maintain it without losing money.</p>
<p>Movies There are three movie theaters: Suzhou, Daguangming, and YMCA. The films must be checked by the Pseudo-Wu County Education Bureau and the Suzhou Special Service Class, and only after obtaining a permit can they be released. It is said that as long as there is no danger (?) in the film, a permit can be obtained. Films such as Thunderstorm and Sunrise have been shown; costume films such as Diaochan and Pan Jinlian are particularly popular. As for the Suzhou Grand Theater, it still consistently shows "foreign films."</p>
<p>Tanhuang In terms of Suzhou Variety, like magic tricks, Xuanjuan, Tangming, Nanci, etc., there have always been two societies, "Yanqing" and "Kaizhi". The scope of business is dedicated to happy hall meetings. Usually, because Suzhou is so crowded, every time there is a "painting hall", it is too busy to respond, so the effort is tightened, and hall meetings are almost non-existent. The business has plummeted, so they have to change their policy and seek other ways out. They have set up a class to organize Tanhuang performances in order to maintain it. At the same time, street singers have also put together classes to organize and perform. Therefore, there are many Tanhuang performances in Suzhou now, and the styles are also very complicated. There are Tanhuang from all over the place, such as Su Tan, Ben Tan, Xi Tan, Changshu, Changzhou Tanhuang, etc., which can hardly be counted. There are about five or six families with a slightly larger scale, roles, costumes, and relatively complete scenery, such as Daohe, Guotai, Fuan, Daxin, and New Oriental. The rest are mostly simple and indescribable.</p>
<p>Storytelling Theater The most common entertainment venue in Suzhou is undoubtedly the storytelling theater. Only four cents per person, with tea included, it can be said to be popularized. There are more than sixty venues in the whole city, but not many can sell "over a hundred". The reason is that the "Sounding Dang" gentlemen are not in the local area, and their appeal is not great, so it is difficult to improve the business. But in the blink of an eye, the lunar New Year is approaching, and the Suzhou "Association Book" will be listed. At that time, the heroes will gather, and there will be a lively scene.</p>
<h3>Talking about the Lineup of the Gengchun Opera Society</h3>
<p>— Chang Gong</p>
<p>The establishment of Gengchun is nearly forty years ago, and it is the oldest group in the Shanghai Opera Circle. There are many talents. Next Monday, it will perform at the Carlton to raise money for refugee relief. Since you gentlemen have this righteous act, I am acquainted with most of the people in this circle, so I dare not refuse the responsibility of introducing them. When talking about Kun Opera, everyone knows Mr. Xu Lingyun. He started on stage when he was more than ten years old, taking Fu Jiao (i.e. the second face) as his main job, but he is also proficient in Laosheng, Jin Sheng, Pheasant Tail Sheng, Clown Jing, Laodan, etc. He is not shy to have been an all-rounder with deep attainments. In his Jing Jiao Opera, I have only seen the play "Liu Tang" in my later years. The performance of the famous family is indeed extraordinary: "Marrying Sister" has only recently been performed. The body movements of this play are already heavy, and Lingyun has added more, making it even more splendid. Lingyun has three sons, all of whom are proficient in Kun Opera. Mr. Shao Jiu's Guan Sheng is especially valued at the time. His demeanor is generous and magnificent, his performance is natural and generous, and his clear voice and delicate singing method make his King Xi Opera (Kun Opera does not have this term, now borrowed) comparable to Anhan and Xielu. This time, he will be able to perform "Amazing Changes" with ease and joy, and lovers of Kunqu Opera should listen to it carefully.</p>
<p>The Yini and delicate part of the play between Sheng and Dan is that no one knows, but in order to accomplish these four words, it is really rare, and it is especially necessary for Sheng and Dan to match the steel. Mr. Yin Zhenxian's Sheng and Ms. Ye Xiaohong's Dan have long been praised by the opera world. The plays that the two gentlemen have collaborated on, such as "Qiao Vinegar", "Hiding Boat", "Stealing Poetry", "Dressing Up", "Kneeling Pool", etc., have been praised as extraordinary. The play "Broken Bridge" has been collaborated on by the two gentlemen many times, and it is truly an immortal work that cannot be seen in ordinary singing venues. Mr. Zhao Xing Shu has the eyes of a beautiful woman, and he can play many plays, all of which are exquisite, and he has a deep research on "Jiā Qī". I have often said that this play is the elite of the daily play, and all the body movements are concentrated on. Those are clumsy strokes that can be described. When appreciating Xing Shu's performance</p>
<p>Kun Opera Laosheng is divided into three types: Sheng, Wai, and Mo. I know three people in Gengchun who sing Laosheng. They are all well-known figures in the opera world. In my private opinion, Mr. Xu Liecheng is dignified and clear, suitable for Sheng, Mr. Chen Shiqian is full of vigor, suitable for Wai; Mr. Guan Jian is knowledgeable and meticulous, suitable for Mo, Liecheng's "Yunyang Fajun" has always been famous, full of energy, stable stage steps, from beginning to end, not at all. It is a masterpiece. Shiqian retreated to be an assistant this time, which is unavoidable to avoid the important and take the light. I suddenly stringed "Looking in the Mirror". I don't know what medicine is sold in his gourd.</p>
<p>Mr. Cui Qianxian is an amateur Beijing Opera player and joined the performance of "Yaguanlou". It is purely a work of skill. Mr. Lu Jianzhi strung "Send Son", with a tragic meaning. The ink of the poets Ge Junmeiting Wang Junji is driven by the heart of charity.</p>
<h3>Tian Ziwén's Love of Cranes and Loss of Government</h3>
<h3>The Benevolent Association Holds a Grand Theatrical Performance</h3>
<p>— (Brush Flower)</p>
<p>For the purpose of raising funds to relieve the disaster-stricken compatriots, the Shanghai Benevolent Association has scheduled a grand theatrical performance by the artistic communities of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing on the 15th of this month at the New Stage. Fifteen troupes of comedic and Peking opera will jointly perform, with over a hundred performers. There will also be miscellaneous performances such as dragon boats, "small carts," "stilt walking," and "yangge dance." The program details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yayun Society - Fang Renmi, Zhang Hama, Zhang Mazi (Day) "Entering the Palace Twice", (Night) "Mending the Pot" · Half-Class Opera - Buddha's Heart Moved (Day) "Zhanzi at the辕门", (Night) "Gaining Proof at Hexia" · Xinsheng Society - Mi Yisu, Fang Xiaowu, Chen Xianwo, Xu Xiaotian (Day) "Si Lang Visits His Mother", (Night) "Russian Dance" · Xinyou Society - Yang Shanyu, Da Pibao, Wang Peijun, Xiao Magu (Day) "Borrowing the East Wind", (Night) "Empty City Stratagem" · Tongsu Society - Da Wawa, Sheng Changxiao, Sai Zhifang, Ma Youliang, Xiao Yanqiu (Day) "Chasing Han Xin", (Night) "Beheading at Jing Hall" · Haixin Society - Hua Yanwu, Hua Luanjing, Hua Feifei (Day) "Water Splashed Before the Horse", (Night) "Afraid of His Wife" · Mingle Society - Ni Dongdong, Da Mianbao, Hong Luobu (Day) "Wooden Man Reporting Kin", (Night) "Enlisting in the Army and Leaving the Kiln." There will also be Chinese martial arts performed by the British Guards Corps: Hai Zhaoxiang, Li Cengsi, Wang Yueqin, Ni Wenhuan, Ma Minglun, Wang Jinxian; martial arts by Jian Shi Hui's Li Zhenqing and Rong Zaiming, featuring Western candles; techniques by Xinhua Technical Troupe's Zhu Enrong and Youth Technical Troupe's Deng Guoqing; Yang Haoting's Peking-style drum song; martial arts by Fuxing Martial Arts Troupe's Wang Guozhen, Zhang Ying, Zhang Shuangqing, Feng Yushan, Zha Hanzhao, Shi Wengao, Mao Yunfei; magic tricks by Deyuntang's Wang Deyan and Wang Fengyun; ventriloquism by Kaikouxiao; Tianjin-style drum song by Yang Furong and Yang Meirong; and stunts by Pan Yuzhen, the strongman. A wide variety of acts, a great collection of artistic talent from Tianjin and Beijing, with various humorous interjections, promises to be very lively. As for the play "Visiting the Temple," performed jointly by all the performers, the plot twists are extremely humorous. Such a grand event has never been seen in Shanghai. Lovers of Tianjin and Beijing theatrical arts, why not go and see it? Ticket prices are divided into two yuan, one yuan, and thirty cents. It is said that all proceeds will be used to help the disaster-stricken compatriots in the war zone, a righteous act worthy of praise. It can be predicted that the stage will be crowded with traffic like dragons and horses at that time, reaching its peak.</p>

<p>Martial artist Wang Guiqing has resigned from the Gongwu Theatre. His determination to leave is firm, and both the front and backstage managers, Zhou Jianxing and Chen Danlou, are still earnestly trying to retain him.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhuxuan, the martial artist from the Xinji Grand Theatre, whose father, Guifen, has been performing in Kunming with Zhao Ruquan's troupe for more than two months without news, went with his sister, Zhuyan, to the Zhao's house yesterday to inquire about their recent situation.

<p>Your work is quite good, but it is too long. We will consider publishing it in installments.</p>
<h3>The Art of Skating (10)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen</p>
<p>Beginner's Introduction (Continued)</p>
<p>Primary and Secondary - The important parts of the body during skating, such as the shoulders, arms, hips, knees, legs, feet, and toes, all have primary and secondary roles. The primary refers to the foot moving on the ground and the upper half of the body above that foot. For example, when the right foot is moving on the ground, the right shoulder etc. is called the primary shoulder, and the left shoulder etc. is called the secondary shoulder.</p>
<p>Supplementary Rules (1) If someone is practicing freestyle skating in the center of the rink, those practicing turning or circling should not cross the center of the rink.</p>
<p>(2) When the secondary foot pushes forward, the entire edge of the sole of the shoe (i.e., both wheels on one side) must be used. Do not push only with the toes. If the heel is slightly stressed, this problem can be avoided. Gradually lengthen the stride, and alternate between the two feet.</p>
<p>(3) The shoes should not grind on the ground. Landing should be silent and must land directly on the side to be used.</p>
<p>(4) When moving forward using the outer edge of the shoe, the body should be as sideways as possible. The secondary shoulder and leg should be mostly behind. When moving forward, the secondary shoulder must move before the secondary leg.</p>
<p>(5) When moving the secondary leg forward, diligently do not bend the knee. This is a common problem, and beginners should pay particular attention. The knee can be slightly bent after it has moved forward.</p>
<p>(6) The method of moving the legs forward and backward varies from person to person, but it should be even and harmonious, not too fast or too slow. Theoretically, the secondary leg moves forward or backward about halfway through a step. In fact, when moving forward, the secondary leg is behind, moving forward halfway to a step, and only moving forward when about to stop. When moving backward, move it backward in the first half of the step, that is, in one step, and gradually move it backward after starting, so that the secondary leg is on the moving foot.</p>
<p>(7) When moving forward, the primary shoulder guides. When moving backward, the secondary shoulder guides.</p>
<p>(8) When skating in an arc, the body should be sideways, and the shoulder and hip should be parallel to the primary foot and turn with the shape. (In the diagram, the solid line shows the right foot, the dotted line shows the left foot, R shows the right shoulder, and L shows the left shoulder.)</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Court and the Pear Garden of the Former Capital (103)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two sheng, two dan, and two jing actually fought and cursed for jealousy over a play.</p>
<p>However, later, Xirui became quite fond of this because the pastor was firm, and he also liked to stroll around Yuezi and pick out personal things, which caused his voice to be far inferior to before. Hao Shouchen's whole family were Christians and did not have any habits such as smoking and drinking, so his voice gradually improved over time. Coincidentally, in a certain hall, a troublemaker specially ordered them to perform "The True and False Li Kui." Originally, Hao and Hou did not have much hatred for each other, but among the audience, there were loyal members of both parties, each supporting their own actors and cheering for their own favorites. It was on these two points that a storm was triggered. It happened that Xirui's voice was not in good condition that day, so his singing and reciting were slightly worse than Shouchen's. Therefore, those who supported Hao became particularly proud and assumed an air as if Xirui had been chewed up by Shouchen. The two on the stage were also one smug and the other dejected. In this way, the hatred between the two became great. Later, during the fight scene in "The True and False Li Kui," Hou Xirui brought out his signature skills. Xirui had a background in the science class, not to mention that. In terms of physique, he was slightly taller than Shouchen, so he was much more flexible and convenient when turning than the fat and short Shouchen. Shouchen's martial skills were originally weaker, and coupled with the fact that the soles of his boots were too high and his body was bulky, how could he be as agile and nimble as Xirui when wielding double axes, flying up and down? At first, he could barely support for a few moves, but later he was simply powerless to fight back, retreating straight back and almost being pushed to the edge of the stage and falling down. At this time, Xirui's face was redeemed, and he was extremely proud. At the same time, those who supported him in the audience also felt a hundred times more energetic and could greatly raise their eyebrows. The above-mentioned three instances of eating opera vinegar all occurred a decade or two ago. At the time, it was hard to say that they were very exciting, but looking back on them later, it always felt like a barbaric act lacking in theatrical ethics. Moreover, it is not easy to train a famous actor. If one gets hurt somewhere due to jealousy over a play and becomes disabled, it is indeed an immoral and very regrettable thing.</p>
