<p>社評</p>
<h3>張伯倫的悲哀</h3>
<p>張伯倫首相已「嚐然若喪」地回到倫敦了。他興高采烈的偕著哈里法克斯跑到羅馬去、卻在墨索里尼那裹碰了一鼻子的茨。一年以來、墨索里尼已騵到了倫敦的巨額借欺，已編到了英法對於義大利帝國的承認；今天，他是再也不肯有一些遷就了。在這决英義談話中，他就斷然表示不願改變對法的態度、不願繼續撒退義籍志願兵，並且要求無條件的承認西班牙叛軍為交戰團體。一句話、墨索里尼、顯欲賴其輔心與國—德國的援助，而積極進行其無娶的慾求！」</p>
<p>這次英義談話的擱淺給予張伯倫的「綏靖」政策以一個很大的打擊，這是早在意料之中的。原來自從去年四月英義協定成立以來，張伯倫首相多方百計的推行著州綏靖歐洲」的政策——所謂一緩靖歐洲」、其實只是一個假託的美名，它的目的實在於促成英·法·德·義·四强公約的締結，以使侵略者的刀鋒轉向蘇聯。為了這個目的，張伯倫不惜付出了非常巨大的代價。在冶擊綏靖一的幌子之下，奧地利是被併合了，義大利的非法侵佔阿比西尼亞是被承認了，西斑牙的合法政府是被對鎖了。捷克是被宰割了。……總而言之，張伯倫的「綏靖政策」到去年十月的慕尼黑會議是爆到了最高舉，慕尼煞協定的締結，可說造四強公的雛形的實現。</p>
<p>然而、我們屢决說過，法西國家和民治國家之間是有艱旗的鴻購的。由於英法的屈辱退讓，慕尼黑協定固然勉強構成了「四強公的」的雛平，但在另一方面，隨若德義法西斯侵略氣燄的日張，慕尼黑協定都也日益加深了四強間的矛盾。照張伯倫如意的打算，他原想造成英國霸權下德怯齣均勢，以安定中東歐。把侵略刀鋒轉向蘇聯。可是事與願違。德義怯西斯在張伯倫的扶掖之下是愈加強大起來了，希特勒今天已不是一個可聽倫敦任意指使的工具，而成為一匹脫羈的野馬了；墨索里尼也向法國大張貪吻，要求殖民地了。不要說法國已陷於孤立的地位，在柏林羅馬軸心的緊壓之下，英國的地位也是相當的削弱和孤立，事實早已顯示著張伯倫的「綏靖」政策是行不通的。可是張伯倫部還是一意孤行，繼續其觀暱侵略者的方針。他這决的訪問羅馬，正是他的綏靖政策的最後努力。現在英義談話終於不歡而散了，這對於張伯倫該是一個很好的教訓。</p>
<p>再睜眼看看歐洲的險惡風雲吧。侵略者姚戰的氣燄已燒得頂天通紅，快要燒到英國的眉睫了。隨著墨素里尼向法國的桃釁，匈牙利又投人「反共集團」了，希特勒久在準備向英國的殖民地進攻了。這時候英國要是再不放棄縱容侵略的「綏靖」政策而挺起脊骨來，將來一定會痛感州噬臍莫及」的。</p>
<p>墨索里尼早已說過：「炮火響於言辭」。可見得言辭對於侵略者根本沒有的束的作用。當一九三五年一月鮑爾溫內閣時代，英國也曾與義國訂結過紳士協定，可是沒幾天，英國商輪就在地中海大受法西斯海決皿鹼龔擊；去年四月的英義協定，一成立就等於廢紙。這一切事實都沒有教訓了張伯倫，都還在橈著不知决數的圓圈，他會有成功嗎？</p>
<p>以力量對力量，予打擊者以打擊，那紕是阻止怯西斯侵略唯一有效的道路！</p>

<h3>剖視</h3>
<p>— 白蕉</p>
<p>我一向覺得國人以愛好和平的民族誇羅於世界而且不憚煩地一而再再而三的向人甚至於向強盜申明的希奇。其意義除州等於說「饒燒我罷！」或是表示「我是絕無氣力的」之外，似乎是無理由可說的。</p>
<p>世界絀所有聰明人的做事情，往往自己欣賞他的聽明辦法，一時驚喜而滿足；但到後來弄得自己也莫名共妙，或竟然自己發覺是愚畫的。即使不然，他閒然聰明一世了，但時間也會告訴他的辦伏畢覺是萬分憑畫。因為他忘記了「人之性」。</p>
<p>說愛好和平吧，誰不愛好和平呢？但你切不可忘記愛好戰爭也是「人之性」——是事實！正如僑恿腸善是一種美德，而人類的天性偏父是喜歡揭發陰私，暴露醜惡；力爭上游是有志然者的所為，而習於下流，也未始不是天性的放任使然</p>
<p>看相打畢竟是有趣的事情；不名譽的傳說，也永遠是「百犬吠聲」；下流之赴，允往往是流運忘返。</p>
<p>所以愛好和平央不是中華民挨的特性，好此每一個民族中多少有一個「猶太性的階級，甚至每個人的血液中多少帶蒲些「澹太性」的血液一樣！</p>
<p>然而人們總不肯對事實「正說」。「文明人」的歡性，「君子人」的虛偽，是世閒一般酌傑作。我人讀歷史，總覺得奏始皇曹操王莽的時代少短了些，不曾有一部欽定的秦史魏史新莽史……之類。所以孟子輿的話，「盡信書，不如無書，」曾國落的欲自銘其墓「不信書，信運氣，公之言，告萬世，一才是正面文章。正面文章的希有而可珍貴，麓是因為一般人所不肯論的緣故。</p>
<p>歐美紳士為何同情於猶太富翁，而忽視一般被墜迫的弱小？煎紀先生何以終於主和，甘冒不達？民主國家為何前些時候不痛不癢地「同情」「譴責」，到現在才有非正義的而趁鬥顏色」的表示？這裹正需要一個「正視」！遺至少我想可以證明宇宙閒是沒有偶然的事的，因為一樁事情的「必然性」，才是合於「人之性」的說明。</p>
<p>東方有三種聖人的典型，一種他假裝不吃豬頭肉，一種是不敢正視豬頰肉，一種是承認豬頭肉是人吃的。然而都是人之性的三種不同表示。</p>
<p>「不見可欲使心不飾」，這種不並獸正視」的聖人態度，我們不必說他過於肌小，缺乏英勇的氣概，正因為聖人並不是超人的綠故。據說有一種人的所以不敢看女人，就是因為看了要心跳之故；以免心跳，於是不禁把臉裝得正經些；把頭低下；把頸頸紐轉；把腳步打緊。江陰施螫夫先生說：「目不斜視，其居心可知！」二這眞是一旬非常中肯的名言。但我的意思不在誅心，在乎股好是大家向事實敢於正說一下。</p>
<p>誰都承認靑年人是進取的。他是熱情而叉敢於正視血的人生。但是安於舊習的惰性彎作，或老又不願意做蒼頭撤腦的改革家，而忽然低下頭，扭轉頭躓，把腳步打娶退後走。道一類的例子，並不好算是一件希奇的事情呢。</p>
<p>在學生時代的靑年，往往自侖為改革家，為新社會的中堅；但不多礎年，便成了一個典型的新式小紳士。傳統的偏見的理由早趕走了他的改革思想。同樣，一個有前進思想的小姐，在先以新女性自居，但矚嫁之篷，立刻成了一個最妣色的摩登少奶奶，做有財勢的丈夫的一截裝飾品附屬品而引以為榮，暘其往日的同伴。新女性時代的活路標榜，正好作了找一偭如意郎君的註糊。這其間的自然，正像中國人的吐痰一樣。所以深於閱歷的前輩，不免莞爾而笑一般姐心子弟輩思想左傾的家長們，以為他們徒事過慮！</p>
<p>勝史上的漢奸，庾不他當時的一個無名小卒；也決不是一個窮光蚤；吏決不楚不明漢好兩個字意義的人，——共至於正浩大颺漢好，題詩品畫，贊揚氣節的人，正和現代的鄭鞏胥主克敏梁鴻志和寫「花隨人聖盒摭憶」及做漢好老」的黃濬輩，决不始小三子小六子和王五趙六竿一般平常腳色！</p>
<p>誰圾不要臉？誰的漢奸成績做得圾好？是富有者呢還是窮光蛋？是有聲望地位者呢還是無名小卒？是知識份子呢還浩無知識者？</p>
<p>「妖由人興」，大時代眞是一面照妖鏡。人們為何還不敢芷視？</p>
<h3>鄕居</h3>
<p>— 英君</p>
<p>幾個年靑的夥伴，拋開了書本，掮起抗戰敎育的旗子，跑到W城近郊，生活了一個多月。可能的結果是：要不為那老舊的環境磨老了我們，便該是我們一革把　悶弄年靑，能雊在犬時代中站立起來。我們有著信心，變不乏熱情。也許都太天眞了一點，但這卻不足稱為工作中難得越過的障礙，我們正要從工作中鍛鍊起來。</p>
<p>起初農民們睜大了眼，望簷我們走入他們的村子，過驚跟他們養不多的生活，每天挑水，弄飯，貿菜，晒太陽。我們把生活的鐵錨拋在遭　趙上，生活氈鵠子把識們扣牢在遺裹，我們要在這裹播下紋已鹹種子，雖然工作需要我們時黠我們還得援毗這錨，向更遠處航行，讓別人到這裹收成。</p>
<p>農反很在劉久然繼耜利力詹桌子小凳，拖了他們的孩子，囁嚅地吐說同樣的一套括，說是孩子如何頑皮，費先生們的心去教導，顯然這是他們經過一度會商的行動。我們和觀的態度稍稍消去他們對我們過度的敬意。當他們看到孩子們服貼地聽丈先生的話，圍成圈子，唱著歌兒，翻開書本都會的陣起來時，牠們的臉土俘上</p>
<h3>鼓動起你的勇氣向前</h3>
<p>— 李文</p>
<p>哭什麼？把你的眼淚擦乾。鼓動起你的勇氣，向前！你不會騵見，祖國在大聲呼喚？你不知道，祖國需要的是我們靑年？且不要沮喪·膽寒，鼓動起你的勇氣，向前！尊重我們自已，把恥辱，深深的牢記。為我們祖國的新生，戰鬥到底！且不要頹廢·噬氣，鼓動起來，你的劈氣！在黑暗面龍，拯救我們的砠國，我們的家園。不要退縮，沒有什麼使得留憑！光明，就在聞前，只籌你：鼓動起你的男氣，向前！了親切的微笑。</p>
<p>是農閑的時候，日間不過砧點穀，碓些粉準備過年，然而這些不妨磯抽水煆，還可算是扯白話的時候。我們和農民之間己消除不少的隔聞，雖然每逢寒暄之後，小媳婦們還都忙羞捧凳子敬茶，當我們踏米砧拙風車的時勝婆婆還歪潸笑臉，哺喃念蒼「罪過罪過」，可是我們已能自由地談話了。灣裹的瑣事，田事的收成，都戲為談資。除了這些，在談話中使他們對抽丁，徵發，租捐專有了初步的理解，那些伕令並不是祇使他們痛苦的。漸漸地你們有了國家民族的觀念，他們開始關心戰情的進展。小媳婦和小姑娘們在課餘把女伴拖到她們的深閨中去，有無限的心事要訴說，有很多的問題耍待解答。對於我們男女一筆住在一起，她們感到詫異；然而很快她們就了解這詩代和她們的婆婆們的時代很不同了。她們曾級被拋秦在百數十年的深抗裹，現在在她們的深心中滋跑著反封建的意識了。她們和女伴間存在若超乎姊妹的友情。</p>
<p>每早在祠堂的白壁旁服例站蒼一泵人和牲畜，他們在看壁報。認議字的吵唔地念簷，不識字的張大了嘴在聽，在看漫畫，牲畜在腳下續。她們總是懇切地喊：「先生，擭點走，多講講。」是的，彼淺顯簡單化了的壁報還不侈，他們需要知道得更多。他們有許多問題，許多意見，時常把辯論延續到我們的小屋于來解夫，整　灣的人們都在學習，新的興趣引起了，雖然有驚各毬不同的進度：有的具有國際關係的慨念，有的還要問為雀麼晝上的　城這末小，而敵人飛機那宋大。可是他們都認淸了敵人，都不甘屈服終奴隸的命還。</p>
<p>聯保主任精我們當了壯了訓練的政治激官，每早我們得派兩個人爬過山去訓話教歌，順便把當日的報紙拿回來。這長長的一段路，是崎嶇而泥濘的，然而魷依藉我們的奔波，縮垠了聯保主任與　趙人們的距離。這是我們的機會，把這些關係調整得很好。後來　灣的人們還和駐紮的軍險演過三天的花鼓戲。</p>
<p>每個黃香之後，在搖幌著的油燈下，聚潸一筆人，熾莊的炭槃灼熱了臉面，我們的小屋擠到了飽和的狀態。間或風雨阻斷了這習慣的晚會，我們的屋子是顯得大得可怕了。農民們沒有意識到這是集體的討論，他們祇是有些發問，有些找答案。但時常能把壁報上提出的問題，找到中心的一點，雖然有時天眞的可笑，然而何嘗沒有眞理的成份。有一决對一個命運論者的唯武器論調，他們自動地集中火力攻擊，結果那說話的哭喪了臉向我們求援。在純換的眞理之前，那些有意無意去披上盧偽的外套的人們是多末卑鄙可恥呵！</p>
<p>然而新春的第三天，在演過三夫戲劇之後，我們論殲我們要離開　萬了，為了有更重要的工作，雖然小屋裹的糙耙和登絲還沒有吃完。</p>
<p>村子口站了一羣人，徒然的挽留不過更添加些悵惘的心情。小孩子靠着大人不聲不響，小媳婦們偷偷地掛兩行清淚。「來　，先生們，更來的　……」在這聲中，老驢子拖了我們的行李，蹣跚地踱出村。</p>
<p>C灣村口兩排參天的老樹，在天邊隱沒了，我們好像還聽得到「要來的地，先生們…</p>
<h3>水滸與民族革命</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>水滸傳與民族革命有很密切的關係，的驪起來，有下列五點：</p>
<p>第一，是晚來觀聖與的决潘人物像贊。高如李嵩畫了像，他就寫像贊。聖與是明季程敏政（宋遺民錄）中的人物；他這樣地稱許水滸英雄，可見他是怎樣熱烈地希望有草澤英雄起而恢復宋室，把元人逐出漢域了。</p>
<p>第二，是元朝羅賞中的水游多合史實。如董平，是楚南的強盜。如關勝會屋拒金兵，見朱史和金史的劉豫傳。又有大刀魏勝在紹興三十一年率領山東的忠義軍，與金人作戰，見宋史卷三六八·如張順張貴可相當於浪裹白條張順和船火兒張橫哺水濟有一回，湧金門張順歸祕。在宋决上，張順確是死在江中的，不過先長江，不是之江究而所抵扒的卻是欠朝的降將呂文煥。如河北王友直梁即王似鱗盧俊義的影子，他們倆都是住在大名府的；並且，王友直所統領的忠義軍是圾大的一股，計兵數萬。友直又是朝廷方面的統制，與普通強盜不同，所以水游傳列他於第二位，以示尊敬。（以上論證，引用逸經第一期謝興堯的水潛傳人物考）遭情形與現在各地興起游擊隊頗為相似。羅貫中親受元代統治下的痛苦，大約也不無餓感吧？</p>
<p>第三是肌代嘉靖間郭動府的本子加入征遼一事。這是頗有深意的。當時北有俺答屢决入寇，南有倭賊時常騷擾，郭勳府中人頗想有像水滸一樣的英雄去防禦州偃，所以纔加入征遼一事，以思古人。</p>
<p>第四是明末張岱（陶庵夢憶）想要挽回明代的傾頹。他稱讚梁山上的人物「英雄忠義之氣，積於筆墨間，」可見他是怎樣嚮往於道些坑戰的志士，烯望晚明也有這勞麒網縱滿淸抗戰了。</p>
<p>第五是淸季天地會的利用水潛傳。天地會即以天為父以地為母之意，由於引用水游「指天地作父母一而來。廈隊一家，與後來賽論採（PearlBuck）譯水渝為“All　AreBrothers”『屯，皓合。因此，康觸現行例中有「禁拜兄弟二條。後來天地會（即三合會或紅帑）加入孫中山的典中會，對於推翻滿淸這一業績上靈了不少的力。</p>
<p>以上五點就是水游與民族革命的關係。我們現在也應該讀水淨傳，各地民眾都起來作自衛戰和游擊戰。</p>

<p>昨日本報經濟專刊所載英日擅處滬海關之經過、亦曾注意到外債之難以續付、蓋此爲英國妥恊政策所必然之結果、英人愈軟弱、日人愈强硬若以日人强硬之故、甚而至於崇拜現實主義之外人、爲此不付之外僓本息、再作妥協讓步之想、以求取得目前之小利、而摧毀遠東所僅存之利益、必有噬躋無及之一日、惟有以實力援助中國、收回失地、不但外債本息、如期支付、即外人一切利益、仍能照常享受也、</p>
<p>近兩年來、中國富翁思作資金之逃避、買回外債者甚多、尤其是各銀行亦頗有以外債作為存項這準備、一旦本息愆期、當不無感覺困難、但此係「日偽」破壞之一種手段、無論如何、各方應通力合作，打破此難關、使日人破壞之計不得售、幸弗以一時之痛、爲所屈伏、遂其要挾、則今日之所得者小、實際所損失者甚大、大致中國方面持券人、有三種神情、一種是懊喪不堪、大爲失望、一種是以爲經外人交涉之結果、「日僞」决不至悍然不顧、一種是以爲無論如何、最後勝利、終歸於我、所不付者不過一時、將來總有本息全收之一日、故中國祗有加强抗戰力量、早獲勝利、則本息早有一日着落、若俯首乞憐、結果終必一無所得、蓋惟具有决心者、始能爭回其所失之權利、故外債之不付，對於中國金融、當然不無影響，但其爲力尙微、至對外信用之喪失、其咎原不在我、中國當局必有以解决之也、倫敦外債行市以前日週六停市、故無電訊加、供給不暢、市價軟弱、恐有續跌可能、烚赤受外滙緊張、債市恐慌影響、紛粉吸納、以乾枯之籌碼、何能供大量吸收、致供給不繼、市價扶搖直上、破圾近紀錄、勢甚挺俏、外幣跟隨外滙軟弱、烚赤高漲關係、上升猛烈、門市交易甚旺、趨勢挺秀、公會交易尙盛、鎰康出長泰進法郞票五千個、祥康出長泰進新加坡票一百元、長泰出森泰進新加坡票一百元、勤泰出森泰進新加坡票一百三十元、承泰出鴻昌進美金票一千元、鴻昌出祥泰進美金票五百元、又出新泰進美金票五百元、咋日市價、英金鎊升四角、英金票升二角五分、美金鎊升四角、美金票升三分五厘、香港票升七厘、法郞票升二厘、新加坡票荷蘭票各升五分、坎拿大票升一分、斐律濱票升四分、其他少數各幣、因未做開、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>金融　關稅債息不充透支黃金劇變　脫售公債移購現金　高峯到二零一八元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗整市况、雖英純金復向下游、然本市金價反向高峯推進、蓋報載財部通吿所有海關担保之各債券、一律暫緩付息後、故而引起一般設富收購藏金心思復濃紛紛脫售公債、移購黃金、加以外滙受各洋行猛扒後、亦繼續略軟、因之買氣燄熾、雖有金號暨銀樓帮拋塞、然仍感粥少僧多、故價衝出二千〇十元關、升達二千〇十八元高峯、唯中途曾因錢兌業暨銀樓帮趁高說售、一度稍挫、卒以供不敵求終難久持、結果又猛漲十七元、各　人心堅中稍帶不定、全天交易頗旺、銀樓首飾金亦二度上升、海關金暨中英純金等復向下跌、</p>
<p>烚赤昨飛漲十七元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開人心因鑒報上財部通吿、所有海關金祖保各借券、一律暫緩付息、故而一般殷富購金心復吿濃厚、致價初開即昂、首由錢兌業進金號五十兩、價二千〇〇三元爲開盤價、繼之證券帮亦進現金號一百兩、價〇四元、後某錢兌業又來吸購，金號五十兩價〇七元、又進銀樓帮五十兩、價〇六元、其問外滙稍報軟化、放價又逐步上升、另一錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價〇七元、某錢兌業亦來搜買、進同業一百兩、價〇八元及〇九元、某銀樓吸進後、俄即回吐予某錢兌業五十兩、價十二元、後忽又復進錢兌業五十兩、價十元、機之另一銀樓帮進錢兌業五十兩、價〇八元、及〇六元、最後錢兌業進金號五十兩、〇八元爲午收價、午後雖外匯平穩、但錢兌業進意愈切、且賣戶奇缺、故漲勢頗銳、開盤即抬高至二千〇十一元、乃錢兌業互做五十兩、繼之又進銀樓帮九十兩、價十四元、後錢兌業又進銀樓帮五十兩、十八元爲最高價、三時四十分錢兌業進金號五十兩、二千〇十七元爲晚收價、較上週六軋漲十七元、此後買戶納胃轉淡、而售者爲形活潑、逐步喊低至十二三元、仍無進者、（據聞錢兌業門市十二元做開數十兩）圾後某錢兌業又想收購、但進者已四出旁觀、故叉抬高至十四五元、然未做開、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇二十五元收進二千〇十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金高懸二〇五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至上午十時二十四分、因烚赤衝出二千〇十元內、故亦隨昇一元、後下午三時二十五分、烚赤又升達二千元〇二十元邊境、故再掛大一元、大同行改懸二百〇五元、新同行懸二百〇三元、收進一百九十七元、</p>
<p>中央純金小一元一</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國純金、（烚赤）收買價退達一千二百十四元六角、掛牌海關金亦低二厘、計二元四角〇一厘、上海標準標金價亦隨跌一元一角、計一千二百〇九元九角、</p>
<h3>外幣猛升</h3>
<p>上週六英純金跌一辦士半、英美滙兌升六八七五、外滙因日方扣留關稅、提存日銀行之後、不允發付、藉以破壞我國之幣政及債信、中央取嚴朋立塲、不再姑息、已拒絕稅務司續向中央銀行透支、撥付債息、致人心激盪、紛購外滙、洋行結款有</p>
<h3>外滙基金並無影響　洋行結款雖仍殷繁　結果所緊甚為微細</h3>
<p>昨日外匯市塲雖有中國財部通告戰區關稅被奪、嗣後以關稅擔保之各債、歷各海關收入分攤價還、不再透支等消息、惟此種調整金融步驟、對於外滙基金、並無影響、蓋不允透支、反可省却一筆外滙頭寸之流出、且聞以往之透支數，爲數尙不甚鉅、至於內債本息、依然照付、更無預於外滙事、故昨日雖洋行結款殷繁、銀行供源不暢、而緊勢殊微、中途且有外電香港等傾寒、故形勢趨穩、並無過大起伏、成交頗旺、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠俱長、紐約現貨仍未更動、倫敦生金縮一辦士半、匯兌英對美大三釐七、對法小十三生丁、對滬勿動、美對英升六八七五、對法長六二五、對滬孤孤、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行早開現貨賣價英匯八辦士三七五、美滙十六元三一二五、較上週六英平、美長〇三一二五、開後外電香港雖仍拋塞、但以銀行紛紛趁賤吸收、並略互相對做英金八辦士三七五、故無影響、匯豐掛脾揭曉各匯如舊、白銀平衡稅公佈大一分半，此後因洋行界結款頻繁、兼之銀行供給不爽、且聞公債狂跌、故狀况漸趨堅軟、美金僅結十六元二五、英金八辦士三四三七五、港匯洋行僅結五十五元八七五、銀行吸進過五十六元、午刻稍回至五十六元一二五、後無變化、將近午時僅做開港匯買賣錢兌業雖塞、而洋行則扒、銀行亦做獲利買賣、是以過程尙平、午收英金八辦士三四三七五、美金十六元二五、</p>
<p>後市雖洋行結款仍繁、唯銀行仍有塞出、致缺乏變動、最後外電供意復萌、而投機商亦來追隨脫售、並以銀行吸胃不佳、故爲狀似稍趨鬆、延至晚收銀行賣價英匯八辦士三四三七五、美匯十六元二五、結果比上週六英縮〇三一二五、美緊零六二五、港緊二五、昨日做開行市因稿擠從略、</p>
<h3>現鈔居奇</h3>
<p>自公債付息問題發生後、貼現率回漲、在意料中、昨日滙劃蔡據貼現率、固然變動仍巨、蓋現鈔需途日廣、有則居奇、每千元初仍盤於三十五元左右、但不久即步高至三十七元二角半、午刻三十六元七角半、下午續稍回下、最後三十六元二角半、比上週六又高一元五角云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　激漲後之黑木耳　號方均思回出</h3>
<p>黑木耳上週因行存吿竭、急於購入、價乃一再上騰、惟市價一高、所有號方囤積之貨、大部均思脫手、故市勢頓見回軟、照昨市情形、以後開價至少當小七八元、因行方售盤未能過份提高故耳、</p>
<h3>紗花紗廠原料移注外棉　本花黃金時代已過去</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約因證券回漲轉好、布疋銷數仍佳、但因華盛頓討論之農萊立法、仍未聞有解决消息、人心恍惚、市上現貨缺乏、市面異常狹小、據統計報吿、十二月份美國國內棉花消耗爲五六五、三〇七包、較前年同期之四三二、三二八包、增加一三二、九七丸包、昨市上現貨商及出口商爲主要買戶、結果近期漲十磅音、遠期漲八九磅音、印度連同頂測漲一羅比餘、埃及跌二三磅音、昨日滙兌較縮、折合法幣、棉價俱漲、美棉巴西棉每担漲一元一角半、印棉漲七角、埃及漲一元四角、</p>
<p>本市外棉交易、華廠申新又向盛亨洋行訂購印棉三千包、計美種辛特一千包、造廠價爲八十八元、叉特種奧默拉二千包、送廠價爲七十二元五角、鴻章亦購印棉路貨三百包、日廠仍爲外棉主要吃戶、因本棉存底甚薄、且將吿罄、如不早辦、屆時或有缺貨之虞、茲將昨日成交件額列後、</p>
<p>昨日成交件額</p>
<p>申新進印棉三千包</p>
<p>鴻章進印棉三百包</p>
<p>裕豐進印棉五百包</p>
<p>裕豐進巴西棉五百包</p>
<p>公大進巴西棉五百包</p>
<p>同興進印棉五百包</p>
<p>同興進巴西棉五百包</p>
<p>本棉生意轉淸。廠方因紗市旣挫、而銷塲不若昔日之暢、對於高價原棉無意採辦、交易沉寂、市價帶疲、日廠近以印棉定貨擁到、足敷應用、目前尙無購本棉之必要、因此市面渙散、惟同業稍有辦胃、亦不過抵解廠額、其餘絕少新發展、棉市已呈不死不活之狀態、蘇北一路來源不薄、兩日來通花到三千五百八十一包、碾砣港來九百件、北沙來三百七十件、出口今日有五十件運汕頭、茲將現棉情形及市盤列左、</p>
<h3>棉紗為債息動搖　浮多喊賣如水下注　售價各跌五六元</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、跌風尤熾、蓋以市塲議論、謂公債付息移往重慶發給、大衆意見爲籌碼緊縮、與多方不利說、浮多斬結、紛至沓來、市盤遂急轉直下、客帮鑒於環境久佳、亦裹足不前、趨勢愈形萎靡、昨現紗晨初開盤、二十支雙馬小五角、江西帮成交十包、未幾賣風驟起、謂泉州港口自動封鎖、滬泉航班已停、重慶空戰劇烈、人心浮助、喊價猶如急流下注、雙罵直瀉至三百七十九元、但同業互根買賣之額量仍巨、成交四百四十五包至收盤聞雲南帮實銷仍有二百餘包、逢低時又有人來收進，雙馬回上二元半、收盤爲三百八十一元半、查上午成交九百零九包、行情廿支雙馬紗比上日跌五元半、雙地球跌四元半、天女跌七允、特金城跌四元、十支粗紗跌五六元、廠方未有舉動、出口則有六百五十件運汕頭、六十五件運香港、三十五件運海口、七十五件運北海、四百九十件運海防、各帮買額列左、</p>
<p>同行六一五江西二四汕頭二〇內地三〇雲南二〇〇溫州一五寗波五合計九〇九</p>
<p>日紗需要岑寂、人心渙散、賣價又跌二元外、加以華紗下挫、日紗更無振作精神、二十支藍鳳現紗價三百〇二元半、本月份三百〇二元半至四元半、二十支水月紗三百〇九元、本月份三百〇五元半至〇七元云、</p>
<h3>糧食　粉麥堅穩</h3>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>昨粉市趨勢堅定、本客交易、依然不弱、惟津帮交易、尙難開展、蓋由於津滬匯率低降、兼當地洋粉軋脚所致、北銷僅恃秦皇島及烟台·威海零星動辦而已、南洋帮仍有福州·汕頭·厦鬥等處問津、報載泉州封港、尙難證實、昨市成交綜計仍有三萬包之數、事船各牌悉照四元九角原盤、昨日有麵粉二萬二千包運往天津、七千二百五十包及麩皮一千包運往汕頭、</p>
<p>小麥</p>
<p>前昨兩天、小麥來源、共計一萬包以上、新到江北蕪湖等麥有一部份受潮之貨、因身軟不能久擱、貨方頗爲遷就、其高燥之貨、居奇如故、而廠方以前定洋麥未接、國麥需要允貪、結果以原盤成交一萬五千包、由福新　辦去一萬包、阜　廠辦去五千包、最高價仍爲六元七角、中决貨及潮麥、售價稍有參差、聞福新阜豐廠合定之洋麥一船、將於下性期初抵埠、昨有新港來麥一千四百包、</p>
<h3>民食前途大堪慮　日人大舉搜刮米糧　在常錫等地預備再辦廿萬包　前後所辦粳秈已有七十萬包　引起囤戶恐慌頗多原包上棧</h3>
<p>粳米</p>
<p>來源仍有限、祗到河下貨五艘、車輪包子四千餘包、聞因日商前在常錫滸浦白茆等地大舉搜辦十餘萬包後、於此陰歷年底以前、再將搜羅二十萬包、松·泗·等地薄稻亦搜辦十餘萬包、綜計日商最近所辦粳秈各米連蕪湖一帶裝運出口、已有七十萬包、人心遂惴惴不安，以爲此說若實、則滬米來源、影響最巨、於是大囤戶頗多將原包上棧、同時本街亦跟踪動辦、售方秉機扳做、晚市遂見森動、結果厚梗行情遂續升幾分至一角、薄稻去路略遜、僅好三五分、羊尖貨稀、再增一角、杜埠尖帶高幾分、變元旣乏大宗來源、而時令應用日繁、故一般小囤戶搜納頗邊、價遂激升二角、陰元仍以斷貨無市、</p>
<p>客秈</p>
<p>到頭雖見蟬聯、然河下本尖缺貨激漲、乃爲本街各戶所注意、南京高秈到頭較少、頗爲貨主居奇、蕪湖米則存到兩多、江西米曾傳有少數運到、均冲京蕪秈售出、故市上迄今未聞有贛米之正式交易、昨交易見旺、成交有二千包之譜、售開者多係十元〇五六角之高蕪秈、而特別冲埠秈則有十一元之價、比上週末較漲一角至角半、</p>
<h3>進出口　福橘源源而來</h3>
<p>厦門蜜橋、源源而來、昨日又到一千七百七十桶、又窰貨二千五百件、</p>
<h3>糖市　靑糖高抬　存貨單薄有以致之</h3>
<p>國產靑糖、近以號貨簿、去化活、放行方對數目較小之潮靑、開價不免抬高、市象有漲度過份之勢、大的須俟新潮靑盛到之時、方有正確市價可言，洋糖公會劃盤、稍有上落二四荷粗白本棧貨二十四元六角半、外棧貨二十四元半，轉口貨十六元四角、荷赤及太古車白、均乏更動、</p>
<p>昨日有糖一百包自北海來、二百包自香港來、五百九十包自汕頭來、又一百包自厦門來、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲價　日益高昂　白廠經開價已至　一千三百五十元</h3>
<p>自上週橫濱報漲之後、海外絲價日益高昂、本埠市情、加之以原料飛漲等因素、更堅昂愈恒、昨橫濱現貨漲五元、開八六五元、遠期八五六元、漲六元、絲市人心、咸望開九〇〇元大關、是故本埠七八分白廠經絲價、廠商討價、已飛躍至一三五〇元矣、但與洋行購價遠距三〇元餘、故未聞成交、里昂絲銷、邇來升騰頗速、白廠絲無勻度絲RR、二〇—二二條紋、昨開一三〇〇元、比較二週前漲五〇元之巨、昨信孚等行共進四〇担、印非絲交昨頗淸靜、竟日未有做開、白土絲價甚疲弱、反之內地綢織需要、已相當蘇醒、故昨有十餘担運溫州轉赴內地</p>
<p>前日（十五日）有人造絲一百六十六箱進口、自意來、</p>
<h3>疋頭　改裝東疋暗中活動　國布交易遂乏躉批</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>粗布斜本週開價不動、細布細斜廠盤綦昂、惟同業手貨以客路動辦稍疏、售價繼續回挫、大鵬·富貴·四平蓮·人鐘·飛鴻各牌細布跌一角之譜、斜紋亦降五分至一角、蓋以前週浙贛擁辦巨額日貨後、即乏躉批　胃、兼以市盤逾格提高後、便利色布運銷、而改裝東布暗中復大肆活動、故客帮白貨交易黯淡無神、僅汕頭帶辦細布細斜五十餘件、餘地交易零星、怡和等廠粗布客銷呆滯、廠盤甚堅、色布新交易以蘇北阜寗爲較旺、成交藍布色斜嗶嘰貢呢二千數百疋、無錫常州亦辦一千五百疋之譜、浙贛鐵路沿綫饒州·金華·南昌各埠零額採辦尙不寂寞、甌甬帮裝出二百餘箱、添辦寥寥、川滇帮及國外星加坡對於淺色布疋需要較切、成交漂布。漂白斜紋·白地花布·色丁各達千疋左右、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>晨市細布細斜喊高（每疋）五分左右、旋復回降、復市微昂，結果與上週六售盤無甚軒輊、十二磅彩球陽鶴細布俱開十一元二角半、龍頭十一元二角二分半、龍頭細斜十元零九角、天津帮進各牌細布細斜的五百餘包、本街染坯生意及零星批發、採辦亦有五六百件、市勢尙稱堅穩、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今日有疋頭四百四十件運汕頭、三十件運香港、五十五件運海口、九十件運海防、</p>
<h3>債息問題所影響於市面者</h3>
<p>昨日上海各種市面所受債息問題之影響，計滙劃票據貼現率升高一元五角、棉紗了結生意突增、售價各跌五·六·七元，烚赤向高峯邁進，飛漲十七元，洋行匯結款增加，紛紛扒進，即英美金票金鎊亦升漲甚鉅，於此可見人心之虛慌，其實大可不必。</p>

<p>改良今日藥育之意見……蓋波</p>
<p>種痘閒話……謝筠夀</p>
<p>B．C．G在上海接種之情形</p>
<h3>言論　改良今日藥育之意見</h3>
<p>— 蓋波</p>
<p>蘆溝橋一聲砲響，把整個的中國從睡眠中被喚醒了。向蒼『抗戰必勝，建國必成』的路程邁進，前幾天申報載激育部欲樹立戰時教育的方針，求各方供獻意見的消息。這正表現著革命的教育部前進的央心，筆者不敏，把私人對於藥育所看見所感覺所希望牆的，寫出來作一個對於教育部的建議。</p>
<p>中國之有藥育，還只是幾年的腰史，在這殘年中間，一直被許多人所忽視，以為藥不過作為醫的一種附屬品而已，並沒有值得重視的地位，自從戰爭爆發，藥邃被漸漸地看重起來，因為牠的需要隨着傷兵難胞的驟增而驟增著，而來鏢本來依靠外來的，却反而銳臧牠輸入的數量。吾們看見許多的難胞，在每次轟炸，都任他們按着創口整天的呼喊着，竟沒有鎮痛藥來臧少他們痛苦。吾們看見許多勇敢的戰士，因為消毒藥劑的缺乏，當為祖國而受創的時候，常常由小小的創口而致無謂的斷送了他們的生命，吾們看見一隊的士兵？由於瘧疾的猖獗，在戰壙裹儘自發抖，熱心的醫生們雖然願意為他們去除這病魔的鎖鏈，但總因沒有金鵝那霜而無能為力，……丰這些都是多褻悲慘的紛事啊！以前對於藥學的估價的錯誤的結果，現在已被曝露勿遺了。</p>
<p>但是不幸得很，現在上海的鞏腎還是戰前的老樣，並沒有因為戰爭的需要而增加他們的敎程，許多平庸的敎授們還是以為藥學生唯一的任務就是為一個獎房裹爰的藥劑師，專注意在檢騐由國外買來的藥品的合不合規定的含量，好像藥學生只是個洋貨的推銷員而已。這租次殖民地的敎育的錯誤，早巳曝露了。但是上臟的藥育一直錯誤汝，而沒有改正。</p>
<p>大時代的鐘聲已經響了，一切的一切，都依着『抗戰必勝，建國必成』的路程邁進，無疑的，關係重大的藥育小能再讓他錯下去了，牠也必須要依着這條大道走去。牠滯要一個獨立國家的敎育，儘量的製造自己所需要的藥品，來拯救許多的傷兵難胞，加強抗戰的效果。</p>
<p>藥品的缺乏，現在雖已大大地感覺不便而痛苦，國際閒航運未斷藥品雖少，還能夠源源翰入，睜開眼睛望望世界的形勞，誰都惶惶於歐洲的風雲，總有變成暴風雨的一天，那時航運停止，藥品的來源將完全斷絕，假使將來的中國還是這樣，吾們誰都不敢想像中國將成怎樣一個恐怖的死國呢！聰明的敎育部，是時候了，應該加速的培餐有實用的藥學人材。</p>
<p>旣然現在的藥育應該依着『抗戰必勝，建國必成』的路上走去，那末敎育者的注意力就應該由專事檢定的一面轉向製造的一面，戰時中國所急須要做的，不外乎兩截，一為模倣國外已有的藥品而自己鑿造，另一即為能盡量的用着國藥，——一筆大大的遺產。</p>
<p>為了要自己製造藥品，當然應該注意的是藥物製造化學。藥品分有機無機二類，由於無機化學的智識的敎育時候比較多，在學生的心目中有個淸楚的概念，一般說來無機藥品的製造比較容易得多，至於有機化學的智識，依上海的藥校只有一年半或兩年的課程，而且只是普通有機化學。關於有機分析方面，雖然藥物化學的有機部分裹，有些零零碎碎的東西藥學生應該有一個有系統的完整有機分析智識，而這些零零碎碎的東西眞是無濟於事，而有機綜合方面在現階段眞是最迫切需要的，在上海的藥校裹衝還沒有這個敎程的設置。因為目前的藥品漸漸趨向於有機方面，所以比有機化學更進一沙的智識，還是許多藥學生所期待着的。</p>
<p>至於利用國藥，那是藥物本草學的智識，誰都知道這是神農以下許多本草學家所遺下的一大堆遺產，遣遺產中間也有至實也有敗絮，因了前人科學智識的不發達，從沒有經過一次有案統的整理工作，所以所謂國藥竟如一堆離亂的草料堆，不易整理，而負起這種責任的，藥學生首當其衝，不幸在戰前，國藥的整理工作與整個的藥學同樣的命運，遭遇着忽視，當一個作彈把許多在華北，東南等等的人之都向川黔滇等著名產國藥的省份裹集中，眼看見許多因瞭乏藥品而致無謂的受着痛苦。或竟至犧牲了性命，而整堆的國產草藥，却不能好好地利用，這是多麼不合情理的可怕而矛盾，負起消除這個矛盾的重大責任，又是屬於藥學生的，試觀在上海的藥校，所讀的生藥學，都是外國的坐藥學，他們讀過古柯葉，山道寗花藥西瓜及莞荽子，但不知道當歸，澤瀉，桔梗，沙參前胡及貝母，他們知道外國產的菲防已，美還志，但不知道國產的防已及遠志，連牠們所用的部分是屬於根，莖，藥花果或種子都不知道。這樣訓練磁來的藥學生畢業後，試問能夠負起這種負担嗎？所以除了生藥學（專載外國生藥）外，還須有國藥的智識，雖然道位學問還是萌芽，使藥舉生知道當歸的藥用部分是根還是莖，這至少是可能的。</p>
<p>退一步說，吾們暫時不要國藥，那未這生藥學的知識還是不夠，因為生藥學裹所講的，只是認識一個生藥的形態及構造，成分而已，而不曾告訴你這生藥是這樣生成的，牠能夠給一個不買贗品的能力，而不能夠把外國貨設法移植到中國來，在中國的領土上生長着相同的藥材，這樣仍舊只是個洋貨的推銷者，仍舊不能自給而有斷藥的危險，所以吾們還要添設藥材的園藝學』，</p>
<p>除了上面所說的，因為適應『抗戰必勝，建國必成』，的目標，而需要添設的四個課程之外，為了增加效率，還應該使學生與校方，相互督促着加速度的　進。</p>
<p>過去學校裹邀請敎授，可以說楚拜博士主義，假使有一個從外國回來，過過幾年麵包生活的，雖然平庸，他的學識不足勝任敎授的位置，但這好像無關緊要的，而敎授的博士的街頭卻非常的引起了校方的注意，像這祿的敎授，他只白費了學生的時間與金錢，阻塞了學生對於這功課所應有的知識，而使學生對於這功課發生了煩悶。</p>
<p>學校是一個大的集團，學生加入這一個集團裹培殖自己的智慧，教授在這個集團裹就是指導學生啟發學生智慧的人，學生有權利發問，敎授有義務啟示，假使這個敎授自己的智慧不足以指導學生啟發學生，反使阻塞學生求知的熱誠，那來為了學生自身的智慧，和敎育當局辦學的目的起見，學生為什麼無權以彈劾這虛佔位置的人呢？——一個一知半解的敎授決不能使他的學生有智識此的滿足。</p>
<p>中國的靑年驚醒了，分數的牢獄早已不能把他們關住，他們已經認識正義，賢明的當局，應該知道靑年學生的新趨向，再不應該以分數的觀念來過分錯估他們的心理。</p>
<p>學生應該有彈劾虛佔位置的敎授的權利，因為敎授的才能能直接影響著學生的前程。他們並不苛求，要個個敎授都像巴斯德愛力喜，或法勒第那樣的博學。但至少限度他應該明瞭他所敎授的東西，假使連這些些的資任都不能勝任，那他就沒有才能來指導啟發學生的智懸。希望敎育當局能夠授權給學生，來彈劾這中庸的敎授，免得使學生白費他們的時間及金錢，阻塞他們的智慧，而使發生無謂煩悶，喊低『抗戰必勝，建國必成』的效率</p>
<p>總上所說，希望能夠使一個藥學生畢業後可以站在自己崗位上，勝任『抗戰必勝建國必成』的任務，而不致學非所用。這雖是私人希望，想一定亦是許多藥學生的迫切的期望，盼賢明的敎育部加以深切的考慮。</p>
<p>通俗醫話</p>
<h3>種痘閒話</h3>
<p>— 謝筠籌</p>
<p>本刋的宗旨。原以科學的立塲。來指導國人健康的常識和糾正國人醫藥上錯誤的觀念。日來天花流行。種痘已為普遍知晚的事實。用不着再來一决「種痘閑話」。但是事實上國人對於添痘的觀念和技衛上還有種種不合的地方。特借本攔。以告讀者。</p>
<p>（一）種痘是接毒嗎　種痘以防天花。巳為一般人所熟知。但憂還有一般人。誤以為種痘是「拔毒」。就是種了痘以後。可以把身體裹邊的毒拔去。從此就可以免除天花的發生。這實在是錯誤的。蓋天花的發生。造因為後天傳染着天花的病原體而發生的。並非嬰兒從母體上得來的毒。也並非嬰兒自己產生的毒。可以借種痘來排泄的。</p>
<p>（二）種痘怎樣可以頂防天花呢　這在醫學上呌做自慟的免疫。原來吾人的身體裹面。有某種外物侵入的時候。血裹面就會產生羞一種的抗毒體。響如甲物侵入的時候。就會產生甲物的抗毒體。種了牛痘以後。就會產生對天花的抗毒體。不幸傳染着天花病原體的時候。因為血裹而為了天花的抗毒體。就可以免除天花的發生。夏季裹的打霍亂頂防針。也是一樣的意思。還有接觸天花病人以後，倘急速地去種痘。仍然有效。因為種痘後在第七不就可發生效力。痘瘡的潛伏期為十天到千三天呢。</p>
<p>（三）為甚麼要多次種痘呢上面所講的抗毒體。在身體裹面保存的時間不一定。有的很長。有的很短。種痘的防禦力。最長為十年。假定抗毒體消滅早的時候。雖然種過了痘。也一樣的可以發生天花。所以法律上規定初生兒出產倏六個月內。應當為節一次種痘。十歲時為第二决種痘。但是遇到天花流行的時候。種痘後已經過五年的時候。或是種痘不發的時候（就是不善感或不感）。都應當再種。</p>
<p>（四）種過花的人和年老的人應當種痘嗎吾們從事實上知道一次發生眞正天花以後。極少有再感傳天花的。所謂本花。是古時代印度和吾國的舊法。就是把痘瘡的痂皮。人工的接種在健康人的鼻腔裹面。發生和天花一樣的病症。不過症侯比較眞正的天花為輕。但是他的免疫力。究竟有多少。是否比較種牛痘為長。吾們不敢億斷。可是事實上種過本花的人。還楚一樣可以再傳染着天花。所以種過本花的人。還是不可森。應當再種。年老的人根據此面所講的本花的不可靠和抗毒饅有消滅的時候。在天花流行的期閒。也應當再種一次為安。</p>
<p>（五）本花應當嚴厲禁止　牛痘苗的優劣。可以用管理方法來取締他。譬如牛的是否健康。製造時候消毒是否完全。但是本花是無智的醫者。把痘瘡痂皮保存起來應用。不但發作的時候。症候遠較牛痘為危險。而且還可以傳染著他種的病毒。就是他所保存的痂皮。如果從有病毒的孩子得來的話。像傳染着梅毒的事情。病歴上是確置無疑的。所以在鄉僻的地方。因為牛痘苗渡有達到。或是頭腦頑固的人。迷信本花勝過牛痘。去應用陳舊危險的方法。豈不楚要嚴厲禁上嗎。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>醫藥紀聞　BCG　在上海接種之情形</h3>
<p>B．C．G有預防癆病之功。世所週知，現在上海巴斯德學院，巳從事製造，自民國二十六年三月起，即在廣慈醫院產科中實行嬰兒接種，至去年十月止，共種嬰孩八百人。接種之法，甚為簡單，即於嬰孩小世後三日五日及七日早間授乳之前半小時，以一安瓶中之所合菌量與溫乳和勻而使嬰孩飮之，即得，嬰兒服用後，不呈局部或全身反應，消化器方面，亦無任何影響，本市醫師有駱需要B．C．G菌苗者，可直接向金神父路巴斯德學院接洽，該院可以免費贈送，但此苗係活菌，不能久存，八日後卽不能用，不然則接種無功，此當注意者也。</p>

<h3>戰時之上海郵政</h3>
<p>— 不典</p>
<p>今「孤島」上之國營機關，猶能於飄搖之局面下，維待其較為完整之機構者，厥惟郵政與海關血已。海嬰自懸掛五色旗後，舊時聲勢，漸形低路，購郵政獨能沉詹應付，兀然自待，推原其故，厥因有階，一曰國際之貫說，二曰社會之卸切，三曰郵政員工之奮鬥，四曰郵政當局處鍛之得宜。四者缺一，郵政即不復能有今日之面目，犧蓋可斷言端。惟旁支細節，不無變動，國欐昆生，允宜劊意，爰就所知，條述於後，題舉「戰時之上海郵政必，荒所以鑒往而別遠也。</p>
<p>郵政之簡史</p>
<p>欲知今日郵政之狀况，必先追溯郵政之沿革，中國郵傳之興，始於周朝，或以步傳，或以馬何，隧代相因，冬所革進，及至明永樂以後，奪波商災，應商業之需求，而有民信局之設立，密佈各練，亙相聯絡，傳遞書信，投交銀物，商几無不稱便。淸光緒年間，朝廷復添設文報局，專司分送官憲之文報，其由海關續辦之郵遞，亦綸始收寄許通人民信件，楚為郵政試辦之始，共先，外人因滿擠中國無郵政，國際通訊不便，乃於逍商口岸，絮設書信館，以辦理互嶔國之書信，迨中嶼郵遲機關成立錢，又黏騰制度不良，仍增殺不巳。漬廷思所以抵制，多方咨商，及至光緒二十二年二月，正式郵鳥始克成立，惟郵局雖已開辦，而客郵競文，郵機猶未統一，幾經交涉，仍未徹鉗，終淸之世，無伙應付。民國九年，中國於萬國郵政會議中，要求撤銷客郵，翌年，美國召開軍縮會躍，中國重申此請，十一月，太平洋與遠東問題委員會開會，各織乃接受此項要求，而於民國十一年十二月，先後徹銷，中國複進而與各謝聯郵，積極與萬國郵會合作。丸一八事變後不久，年能贏餘二百萬之東三省郵區皺擭，郵政經濟，頗受打擊。足國二十四年一月，全國足信局，經收府取鈽，全數停辦，郵政當局，積飩謀郵政經諱細農乏藝蠢編，與乎糾激之濺暹，僅座并慶劍之糾郵，洶補襲翟，民國二十六年度，竟飯餘至六七百萬，各獵郵局，乃更事發展，不久，中日戰起，而打擊亦繼之以來。</p>
<p>戰時之遷移</p>
<p>八一三戰端旣開，郵局因位處北四川路，接近日軍防區，一時謠言　起，惟全體郵務員工，在局長領導之下，仍能鎭靜工作，除將沿北四川路天情路一帶大咫緊閉外，內部工作，照常進行。八一四空戰後，日軍管制虻森區燈火，郵局晚閒工作，既受妨得，日問收發函件，因民眾多不願羅危險儀域，致工作淸淡，而特區各支淌，頓形忙碌，不得已，乃於八月十六日，由當局下令，將業務及經濟部門，分邏至下列各支局辦公：</p>
<p>（一）愚園路（卽靜安寺支局新址。）</p>
<p>（二）馬斯南路支局</p>
<p>（三）江西路儲灑局</p>
<p>而以愚園路為樞紐。至於臨近戰區之本埠各支局，如：提籃橋，界路，北叫川路等局，亦相棧停辦，各該局界下郵件，集留公飴馬路，愷自巢路，卡鏟路，靜安寺路等支婦待領。望於北四川路管理局，除大門緊嬰外，各閒仍逐日派饑，掄流駐守，局長對於守局人員，曾以應其前錢士兵同等之耕卹相媽，並謂駝守郵局，與防守戰壙無異。故邏燭動機，全為便利民眾。戰事雖極激烈，管理局方面之肚守，未曾一日或　也。</p>
<p>軍郵之設施與解散</p>
<p>當戰事激烈之間，四郊軍隊，駐紥甚多，為便利士兵函件之投遞與轉寄起見，二十六年九月間，乃有軍郵組之殺立，嗣界軍隊西撇，該組大部人員，亦隨之以去，遂於十二月閒，宣告結束。</p>
<p>員工薪給之折扣</p>
<p>抗戰發動後，戰區擴大，郵政經濟，收入猝減，部令郵局員工薪給，于一月份起，除四十元生活費外，非戰孤六折，戰區八折，至二十七年二月問，改訂為除糾十元生活費外，一五〇元以下八折，一五〇元至三〇〇元七折，三〇〇元以上六折，四月與五月閒，叉有兩度更載，至六月間，復釘正為除生活費四十元外，一九〇元以下八折，一九○允以上七折，澀胞目前，尚無擊動。二月間，又會驚訂疏散員工辦法，分『造敵』與『居家候之南種，當經全體員工反對，事未果行，而分人則來離嗾使漢奸，散發傳單，意圖鼓動風潮，從中漁利，卒因全體員工，深明大義，未為所　，種種難關，均得安然渡過。　（未完）</p>

<h3>春秋　倒也！倒也！</h3>
<p>— 魯進</p>
<p>跨下了「三日佔上海，十日下南京」的大口底，遠征隊一，到了一年又半的現在，自然是有些捉襟見肘了，但是中國的軍隊却愈打愈勁，而且政見都統一了，即使想慫恿一個傀儡來開開和平之門，也徒然暴露自己的惶恐，卑鄙，——這叫做騎虎難下。</p>
<p>在守著這般廣大的地區而無法進取的時候，在財政羅掘巳窮的時候，衹有開窰子，販黑老，讓遠征的兵士做些工作，而榨取一點錢，這名之曰「繁榮」的「政策」，也是最後的「下策」了。可是一片焦土，滿眼瓦礫，既無從「繁榮」，也無財帛可榨，由「滑稽之流」招呼中國的老百姓「來啊，來啊」吧，却不幸來了一隊遊擊隊，而居住著的老百姓也忽然全變做「莠民」，「麻醉民心」和「就地徵　」的如意算盤正如自扳石頭自壓腳。——這叫做「啼笑皆非」。</p>
<p>而現在又更進一步，不僅財政羅掘巳窮，連軍隊都將不夠分配，方法却還多得想的，組織「反共青年團」，「強徴一百三十五萬人」，這果然又是「以華制華」的毒辣政策；然而在遊擊區中的中國青年能否隨便打發，他們自己也恐懼著「是否放心此等武裝華人」，猶屬疑問，——這是「左右為難」了。</p>
<p>總之，近衛即不能保「衛」社稷，平沼騏一郎恐也不能「平」此大難，即使高唱「長期戰爭」，也將如喝了蒙汗藥酒似的，行將見「倒也，倒也」了！</p>
<h3>人類的恥辱</h3>
<p>— 陸離</p>
<p>嚴冷的冬天到了，走在路上，迎面吹來的寒風，像尖刀一般割著我的臉、耳、鼻……刺刺作痛。許多無家可歸的難胞，蜷縮在人行道上，或者弄角裏，身上遮著一條僅有的破蓆子，有的連此都沒有，在刺骨的北風裏打著抖。我每當看到這樣的情景，總是深深地被感動得透不過氣來。他們正為著祖國的生存和獨立在忍受著絕大的苦難啊！我墮下了幾顆淚珠。難然，我的力量足微弱的，僅此「同情」而已。</p>
<p>然而，可痛心的，却正有人還在吮吸著受難者的血，在受難者的身上使起謀殺的刀子來，這委實令我吃驚，而慨嘆於「人之異於禽獸者幾希」！</p>
<p>「滬西法華鎮第四十二難民收容所主任沈芝光，原亦屬收容所內之難民，因經有力者之保薦，得充此項職位，近竟尅扣難民糧食，私自出售以中飽私囊，並因難民實山人張伯元洩漏秘密，向上峯告發，致將張私刑吊打，遍體鱗傷，復以言詞恫嚇，擬告以誣告名義，送交偽組織「大道市政府」使受更嚴厲之刑罰，張懼而越牆逃出，卒以傷勢過重，行未數步而倒斃於途中……」</p>
<p>這是怎樣一個血淋淋的例子。自己同受過難，自然深體其中的苦痛，該應如何努力去改善難胞的生活，減少他們的痛苦，這要是稍有「人心」的人都會這樣做的。但是，沈等他們呢，却不但無動於中，更且橫施壓迫，恫嚇、誣衊、殘害，盡量暴露他們的獸性，險毒程度，是尤甚於蛇蠍的，可憎亦屬可殺！我讀著這段新聞，我的心中和腦中，被憤怒之火燒灼，憤怒使我發狂，我高聲呼喊，這是人的世界？人的行為？我知道這世界正充滿著這些外蒙人面內藏獸心的牛鬼蛇神……。</p>
<p>我不悲哀，也不歎息，我要無情地詛咒，無情的唾罵，我更要無情的進攻，戳破他們的嘴臉。</p>
<p>這是人類的恥辱！</p>
<h3>上海掌故譚</h3>
<p>— 沆齊主</p>
<p>新世界遊藝場鼓詞</p>
<p>新編上海新世界遊戲場說唱鼓詞</p>
<p>在上海，常有應時之鼓詞出現，「宣統二次登基」，「中俄戰爭鼓詞」之類，每凡一特殊事實發生，必有新鼓詞隨之產生。「新世界遊戲場鼓詞」，即其間一種，以遊戲場生活，為其歌唱對象。</p>
<p>此書之作成，在遊戲場初起時，「新世界」在當時，規模尤為宏大，非若今日之落後。作者所以彈唱「新世界」而不及「大世界」者，其主因似在此。顧無論其為「新世界」，「大世界」，抑其他「世界」，吾人能於此薄薄四冊書中，得見海上游戲場初興時之盛況，聞所得已有足多者，此亦余之所以說此一部鼓詞之動機也。</p>
<p>書前有插圖，為「大鼓詞書場」，為「雙簧」，為「洋人跳舞」，為「名妓棄唱」，為「西法魔術」，為「馬戲場」，為「石樑懸瀑」，為「自山廳」，為「卓別林」，為「打鞦韆」。書全題「新編上海新世界遊戲場說唱鼓詞」，共分四卷，卷四回，回目如次：</p>
<p>第一回　開風氣倡辦遊戲場　赴上海調查新世界</p>
<p>第二回　許振華訪友哈同園　管亞興陪遊新世界</p>
<p>第三回　評歌妓名士多情　打鞦韆女郎好勝</p>
<p>第四回　九女裸體浴銀河　五人暢遊博物院</p>
<p>第五回　走地道尋覓西餐　遊假山樂觀縣瀑</p>
<p>第六回　觀瀑布滑稽嘲醉漢　聽女戲聞坐論優伶</p>
<p>第七回　第二劇寫影戲開篇　施放焰火遊藝閉幕</p>
<p>第八回　同旅館聞評新世界　看馬戲偶結歡客緣</p>
<p>第九回　獻武技勇士竄刀　比工夫美人賽馬</p>
<p>第十回　大餐　好友　嘲　自由廳富人受辱</p>
<p>第十一回　跳舞會上醜漢被愚　屋頂劇　西人獻技</p>
<p>第十二回　演影戲詳觀偵探事　聽淫詞遊客不勝情</p>
<p>第十三回　二層樓　番看焰火　五朋友三進遊戲場</p>
<p>第十四回　朱買臣打柴猶苦讀　鄔氏女拚命要休書</p>
<p>第十五回　朱買臣得中榮歸　鄔氏女長亭潑水</p>
<p>第十六回　觀懸瀑無端揭黑幕　　劇場飽看錦澤圖</p>
<p>全書以一遊客作線索，彈唱「新世界」中種種遊藝，及其表演過程，甚是細膩。於當時表演之人物，亦詳有介紹。逐回有聞場詩一首，說白興唱句相埒。在寫作技術方面，殊難顯其優秀。江東茂記書局刊，石印中箱本，分訂四冊，停了巳不易得。然即遊戲場，二十年來，亦有極多　　革矣。</p>
<h3>上海人的吃食</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>開頭一句話，我們可以說，上海人的吃福是不淺的。只要你有「錢」，任何時候，都可以立刻將你心裏所要想吃的東西，拿來放在你面前，無論是南京的板鴨，北平的密棗，四川的銀耳，甚至於是美國的橘子，法國的香檳，在上海哪一樣不能夠辦到？</p>
<p>自從戰事爆發之後，四鄉各地的吃食店，都被迫遷移，或被炸彈炸燬了，於是，在人力物力所及的範圍之下，相繼地灈來上海租界內繼續營業的，為數正不知有多少，在今日，只消你一抬頭，就會很容易地可以看見，這裏有一家蘇州采芝齊的上海支店，那裏又有一家「崑山鴨麵」的小吃館開設著。</p>
<p>一個住在上海的人，準可以每天從天亮直到半夜為止，不停地吃食各樣東西。</p>
<p>在早晨，上海人向例是很少有在家裏吃粥飯的。有錢的人們，當然可以上溫暖的茶室裏去，吃上幾客所謂「早點」的東西。試問大東，大三元，冠生園等有名的幾家茶室，在那一天的早晨，不都是「賓客滿座」的？叉燒包，雞肉包，伊府麵以及牛奶，土司，咖啡……等等名目，真是多得不可勝數，致任何人見了，均不免要垂涎三尺。其次，吾們又可以在五芳齋，五福齋等點心鋪裏，看見無數的人頭在攢動，每天早晨，在　裏吃些鱔魚麵，小肉麵，湯包之類，的確也很夠味道。至於一般做工的朋友，為了來不及在家裏煮粥的緣故，也爽爽氣氣地花上幾個點心錢，每晨來將他們的肚子裝飽；反正街頭儘多些大餅油條，栥飯團，油豆腐線粉，豆腐漿，豆腐花的攤擔，他們一走出門，是不難快快地趕完一頓「早餐」去上工的。</p>
<p>到了中午的十二時，每一個人又必須要經過每一天的「第二餐」了。自然，「第二餐」與早晨的「第一餐」一樣，有許多人走進「富儷堂皇」的酒菜館裏去吃上幾元錢一客的「精美」大菜，或點上些什麼「魚翅」之類的東西。一般的職員階級的人們，却高興聚合了三四個人，同住「飯店弄堂」裏去吃一頓價並不高，而物並不壞的，實惠的飯菜的。再次，則上小飯鋪去，點上一只「鹹肉豆腐湯」，或「鹹菜肉絲」吃吃，每頓每人花不了二毛錢，而所得的興緻，倒並不比上大菜館的朋友低落了多少。</p>
<p>「日度三餐」，到了下午六時左右，就是吾們度「第三餐」的時候了，自一方面看來，這一餐好似比他二餐要輕淡得多，有許多人家，寗願在夜裏，買些「油汆黃豆」，「油汆果肉」，「醬蘿蔔」之類，吃些「淘茶飯」的，同樣，又有許多人喜歡在夜裏吃粥，但是，在另一方面，開設酒席，盛筵之類的時候，還是以夜間的作為「正場」。</p>
<p>上海人每一天除了三餐之外，還不時的可以吃「點心」，「茶食」等等東西。什麼「餛飩」呀，「水餃子」呀，「鍋貼」呀，「生煎饅頭」呀，「排骨麵」呀，只要你肚子吃得下，是不怕你不想吃的。</p>
<p>雖至夜深人靜的時候，在朦朧的月光下，你準會還可以聽見，有人在里弄內呌喊著「炒米粉」，「火腿粽子」，「白糖蓮心粥」，與「桂花赤豆湯」；而更有人在無線電裏，播送著「豆沙湯麵」，「酒釀小圓子」的廣告呢。</p>
<p>最後，吾們又可以說，上海人的吃福是不淺的！</p>

<p>林工師妙解標準化　金導員高談平等觀</p>
<p>何儷玉小姐說道：「新築的路，有稱之為什麼道的。舊時的路，原名什麼街，什麼巷的，還是照從前名稱。我們中國，有許多街巷的名稱，極為典雅的，我們似乎不必去改換它。」金小姐道：「無論中國人，外國人，都有一種脾氣，每逢一次改革，老是把幾個名人要人的名字，作為街路的名稱。雖然這也表示崇拜英雄之意，但偶一為之則可，東也這樣一個名稱，西也這樣一個名稱，就要覺得討厭了。要是崇拜英雄的說法，那末世界不絕地進步，縱然說前無古人，不能說後無來者。英雄之後，還有英雄，這個路名，可要時時改換了。依我說，正如儷玉姊所說的，從前街巷，有很典雅的名稱，倒不如仍舊貫，却是一勞永逸之策。」何儷玉道：「用名人的姓氏，題為地名物名，也是外國最多，中國人後來也就學樣了。我聽得我們祖老太爺講：最先開到我們廣州來的一條英國船，它的船名，便叫「孔夫子」。他們以為我們中國最尊崇的是孔夫子，所以把開到中國的船，取了中國人最尊崇的人名，作為船名呢。到後來，中國漸漸歐化了，把人名題為地名的更多了。」金小姐道：「有的地方稱路，有的地方稱道，在名稱上，我們要把它統一了　對。」這時金小姐的未婚夫林先生，正在忙著開車，聽了這話，回頭笑道：你近來的思想，什麼都想一個統一，我以為有的固然要統一，有的不統一也好。金小姐忙問道：「為什麼有的不統一倒好呢？」林先生道：「譬如你瞧路旁的房屋，現在新造的，有各種各樣的式子，有古代式的，有現代式的，有法國式的，有德國式的。要照著你事事都歸統一的話，那就房子都成了一種式樣，還有什麼興趣嗎？近來工業家都提倡標準化，我就不大贊成，不過在中國工業草創時代，不能不如罷了。」原來這位林先生，他是位留學法國的建築工程師。中國有許多大建築，都由他設計打樣。年紀雖然還不過二十八歲，而技術優秀，人物漂亮，誰不知道這位少年工程師林建成先生。（一五）</p>

<p>彈詞家在書塲裏電台上，未說正書之前，都要彈唱一隻開篇。開篇的句子，大半是古氣盎然的詩句，聽衆手頭有原文對證，還不免一知半解；倘若沒有原文，唱的又是兪調，簡直聽不懂。</p>
<p>開篇雖是正書的附庸，在社會敎育上，有相當的價値。如果能改編白話，拋棄封建思想，用新頴寓意的題材，唱來如白香山詞，老嫗俱解，他的效率，無疑是在正書之上。因爲開篇較短，數分鐘就可唱完，而正書起碼要說三四排，方能暫吿結束。開篇像電影的卡通，平戲的齣頭戲，雖不能使書迷過痛，决不是點綴品。</p>

<h3>婦職劇團處女演出　女子公寓觀感</h3>
<p>— 冰獨</p>
<p>爲了參加另一個聯歡會，沒有看到這個戲的全部。但以後半部來說，雖則並未有較好的成就，但也不曾那麼失敗。應該說，在人物性格的描寫之下，齊維德趙冠英以及牛大王這三個人這裏均有很好的演出。然而，不是有幾位發音或台詞上稍欠準備時間，像趙母等他們也是相當忠實而且頗爲努力的。</p>
<p>一個初决跨上舞台的業餘劇人，我們對於它的期望，乃是燦爛的未來，「女子公寓」雖不能優越於「靑島」，但，可貴的正是她們對於戲劇的熱誠非常年靑，而且這種大膽嘗試的精神，也是値得致敬的。</p>
<p>可是，話也得說回來，除了對於「婦職劇團」的本身在原則上應予以讚譽鼓勵之外，我們更應當積極地使其成長進步。譬如說，在演技上，當然免不了還有很多生澀和鬆懈的地方，但，這些缺點，正是每一個劇人初上舞臺時的必然現象，我們相信那是會得漸漸消除的。</p>
<p>燈光尙佳，服裝道具以及音響化裝，這裏不曾佔據較重的部分，最顯明的導演是想完全注重於戲的演出，但結果則戲的發展却沒有到達預期的緊凑，處理全劇的空氣很覺疏淡，像父母子女的會見以及趙子出走時的兩塲戲都沒有使它强調，但冠英哭訴一節則甚精彩一不過，在大體上，以一個初上舞臺的「婦職劇團」，能够有這樣的成就，已經是很可喜的了。而且，像洪謨的齊維德，張仍珠的趙冠英，都很自然逼眞，從「女子公寓」開始，我們希望「婦職劇團」能以更進步的姿熊再度與我們相見。</p>

<h3>British Note to Japan States Willingness to Negotiate with Independent and Sovereign China on Issues Such as Abolishing Extraterritoriality; France to Issue Similar Note</h3>
<p>(London) Diplomatic circles here were greatly shocked by the strong wording of the most recent document submitted by British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. However, it is emphasized that the note does not definitively close the door to reconciliation and resolving disputes between Britain and Japan. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The full text of the note presented yesterday to the Japanese government by British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie has been released. Responsible individuals commenting on it state that it is a stern warning from Britain to Japan, urging it to respect the Nine-Power Treaty both in letter and spirit. The U.S. government recently presented a similar note to Japan at the end of December. As the League of Nations Council meets, Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo is also expected to present a report on the Far Eastern situation. The timing of this British note is significant and worth considering. This note does not block the path for negotiations among the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty and recognizes the possibility of adjustments to the Far Eastern situation, similar to the U.S. note. However, if Japan refuses to acknowledge that the principle of the Open Door remains effective and does not follow the path of free negotiations to discuss the adjustment of the Far Eastern situation with relevant countries—in other words, if it ignores the Western powers—Britain and the United States may agree on retaliatory measures, which is not out of the question. Furthermore, the British note states that once peace is restored, the British government is willing to engage in negotiations with a "completely autonomous Chinese government" to reconsider the issue of extraterritorial jurisdiction and abolish it completely. This kind of negotiation and friendly attitude was evident when the Weihaiwei administration was returned to the Chinese government in 1930. Its essence is different from Japan's so-called new policy towards China. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the British note to Japan was known to and approved by France long ago. Therefore, there is reason to believe that this note has been under consideration in London for quite some time. After the U.S. sent a note to Japan, Britain reconsidered the wording of its own note. The British and American notes are closely aligned. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources here claim that the note presented to Japan yesterday by the British government was fully endorsed by the French government, and that it will present a similar note to the Japanese government in the near future. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the need to respect the Nine-Power Treaty, political figures here are very satisfied with the British government's note to Japan, issued yesterday. They say that the American position was explained by Secretary of State Hull in his note to Japan on December 31st of last year, and that its content is quite similar to the British note. Broadly speaking, the rights held by Britain and the United States in China were established by the Nine-Power Treaty, and both sides intend to safeguard them. They also reject Japan's proposal for a "New Order in East Asia." Their views are in agreement. The firm attitude adopted by the American government has exerted a positive influence on Britain. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The full text of the British government's note to Japan, which was released only today, is as follows. The note begins by stating that the British government, after studying the recent declarations of Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and other Japanese politicians regarding Japan's new policy in the Far East, is uncertain about their intentions and has serious concerns. These concerns were not alleviated by the meeting between the British Ambassador to Japan and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. From these declarations and the official information released by Japan, the British government infers that the intention of the Japanese government is to establish a combination or group of Japan, China, and Manchuria, with Japan wielding authority and China and Manchuria in subordinate positions. As far as China is concerned, the Japanese government intends, at least for a certain period, to govern through the Asia Development Board, which is responsible for formulating and implementing policies regarding Chinese political, economic, and cultural affairs. Arita's statement to the press indicates that the aim of this tripartite combination is to create an economic unit in which the economic activities of other powers must be restricted by the group's defense needs and economic security. According to Prime Minister Konoe's declaration, the war against China will continue until the Chinese government is crushed or agrees to join the group on Japanese terms. Furthermore, China and Japan would conclude an anti-communist agreement, allowing Japan to station troops indefinitely in designated locations within China, ostensibly to ensure the fulfillment of Japanese truce terms. Moreover, Konoe stated that Inner Mongolia should be designated as a special anti-communist zone. The meaning of this is unclear, but until more information is available, it is reasonable to assume that Inner Mongolia will be subject to Japanese military control to an even greater extent than other parts of China. Konoe once assured that Japan did not want to seize Chinese territory and would respect its sovereignty. The British government does not understand how this statement can be reconciled with the Japanese government's declared intention to force the Chinese people to accept Japanese terms, which would involve handing over the control of their political, economic, and cultural life to Japan, maintaining a large number of Japanese troops in China indefinitely, and effectively separating Inner Mongolia from China. The British government now wishes to declare that Britain is not prepared to accept or recognize the nature of the changes expressed by Japan, as they have been achieved by force. The British government intends to uphold the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and cannot agree to a unilateral revision of its terms. The British government also wishes to point out that before the outbreak of the war, the beneficial effects that the treaty could be expected to produce were gradually being realized. The Chinese people are currently maintaining and developing an effective and stable government, and the principle of equal opportunity in industry is enabling China and its international trade, including Japan, to flourish. Therefore, the British government cannot accept Japan's suggestion that the Nine-Power Treaty is now obsolete or that its provisions no longer conform to the current situation. The situation created by Japan's violation of the treaty should be considered separately. The British government firmly insists that the treaty cannot be unilaterally revised and must be negotiated by all signatory countries. However, it does not believe that the treaty is of a permanent nature. Therefore, if the Japanese government has any specific suggestions regarding the amendment of any multilateral treaties related to China, the British government is prepared to consider them. In the meantime, the British government reserves all its rights under existing treaties. Furthermore, Konoe's declaration of December 22nd stated that Japan is prepared to consider abolishing extraterritoriality in China and recovering foreign concessions. This inducement to China to accept Japanese terms involves no sacrifice on the part of Japan, as there would be no need for extraterritoriality or concessions if Japan were to succeed in its plan to control China. The British government must recall that it had already been negotiating with the Chinese government on the abolition of British extraterritorial rights in 1931, and was on the verge of completion, but these negotiations were suspended by the Chinese government due to the turmoil caused by the Japanese seizure of Manchuria that year. However, the British government is always prepared to resume negotiations at the appropriate time, and is prepared to discuss this matter and other similar issues with a fully independent Chinese government once peace is restored. The conclusion states that if the British government has misunderstood the Japanese government's intentions in any possible way, it is due to the ambiguity of the language used by Japan to express these intentions. The British government would welcome a clearer and more detailed statement from Japan on its terms for ending the war and its policy towards China. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain's Strong Note to Japan Receives Approval from British and American Public Opinion; If Japan Does Not Realize Its Errors, Active Measures Will Be Taken; Some Newspapers Feel Britain's Actions Are Too Late</h3>
<p>(London) Following the release of the British government's note to Japan on the 14th of this month, the newspapers here have all given it positive reviews, expressing concern about the Japanese government's Far Eastern policy. Every newspaper reports that the note explicitly addresses Japan's efforts to force China into close political and economic cooperation with itself and its ally, "Manchukuo," and to permanently close the doors to foreign trade with the Far East. The scope of the note and the attitude it expresses are similar to the note submitted by the U.S. government on December 31st of last year. Britain is the largest investor in China, and the country with the most trade with China. The U.S. is the country with the most trade with China and the largest investor in China. There is ample reason for concern about Japan's attempt to establish a "New Order" in East Asia, which would turn China into a colony and severely exclude Western influence. Moreover, the Western powers' influence in China, its goals, and the methods used are all peaceful in nature, which is very different from Japan's invasion of China. Although Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bomb Chinese cities, the Chinese resistance is increasing rather than decreasing. The British government need not ask the Japanese government for permission to maintain friendly relations with the Chinese government. The construction of a highway between British Burma and Yunnan Province in China, and the loans provided by Britain and the U.S. to China on credit, show that China is still a great independent nation. The Conservative Daily Express states that "if Japan closes the doors of China to exclude our commerce, we can also close our doors to exclude Japanese commerce. According to the Congo Treaty concluded by Britain and Germany, Japanese cotton textiles imported into British colonies in East Africa enjoy the same treatment as British cotton textiles. Japan's actions in China have given us full rights to abolish this treaty. We should abolish it immediately so that the Lancashire cotton industry can regain the rights it deserves in the African market." According to well-informed sources, the British government's proposed plan is to prohibit the import of certain Japanese goods into Britain and to impose heavy taxes on other goods. This measure will be implemented not only in the United Kingdom but also in its non-self-governing colonies. The self-governing dominions are expected to take parallel actions. The Conservative Morning Post states that the note presented by the government yesterday is a timely and necessary response. It was reviewed by U.S. and French authorities before being sent to Japan. If Japan continues to act humbly on the surface but ignores the demands of other countries, then Britain, the U.S. and France may cooperate to retaliate against Japan. The implementation of this measure would involve punishing the existing puppet government. It is clear that the powers cannot recognize its qualifications to negotiate on Chinese affairs. The Daily Telegraph states that anyone who has studied the statements of Japanese officials and theorists welcomes the clarity of the wording of this decisive British note. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan had imposed some nominal restrictions on its war aims against China, but these original restrictions have long been abandoned, and their extent exceeds what was intended. The goal now is not only to destroy the National Government or reoccupy several provinces of China. Look at former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's statements in December. It would be unwise to believe that active Anglo-American action is impossible. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Today's Manchester Guardian states that the only valid criticism of the British note to Japan is that it was sent too late. On the other hand, we should not forget that our public servants have rarely spoken so frankly in the past eight or nine years, which is commendable. If the British government continues to follow the U.S. government step by step, which is almost certain to happen, then we believe that Japan will pay due attention. This decisive American note is the first expression of President Roosevelt's support for democracy, and the first decisive indication that the British government will no longer continue to retreat before aggressors. The reaction to this note in Berlin and Rome will be no less than the joy in Tokyo, and the joy in Chongqing will be no less than in London and New York. The Morning Post comments that the meaning of the note can be summarized in one word: "Enough!" The note was sent after consultation with the U.S. and French governments. If Japan continues to act externally with outward respect and inwardly with deception, then Britain will likely cooperate with the U.S. to take retaliatory action. This action will likely involve imposing heavy taxes on Japanese goods, or even completely prohibiting the import of Japanese goods into Britain and its colonies. British businessmen will be overjoyed that the government is prepared to step in to prevent their interests from being completely destroyed. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Herald Tribune commented today that Britain has become a follower of the United States. The New York Times also said that Japan is now facing a united Anglo-American front standing against its ideal of a "New Order." Washington's diplomatic circles responded to the British note by saying that Japan is now facing united opposition.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei in Hanoi Negotiating with Japan</h3>

<h3>Chinese Authorities Express Satisfaction</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) When the reporter inquired about the opinion of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the British government's presentation of a note to the Japanese government on the 10th of January, the following reply was received: "The note sent by the British Ambassador to Japan to the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 10th of January fully expresses the British government's solemn attitude towards Japan. It is not intimidated or deceived by the Japanese side's repeated attempts to create a puppet regime. The note states that the British side will adhere to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, refuse to recognize any situation created by the Japanese side through the use of force, and oppose the unilateral revision of the Nine-Power Treaty. Its position is completely consistent with the two notes presented by the United States to Japan on the 6th of October and the 31st of December of last year. As for its exposure of the fact that Konoe's statement of December 22nd regarding the lack of territorial ambitions and the respect for Chinese sovereignty is fundamentally incompatible with its demand for stationing troops in China and designating Inner Mongolia as a special anti-communist zone, it shows true insight. It is understood that the British side consulted with the U.S. government before sending this note. Thus, the policies of the United States, Britain, and France, the main signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, towards Japan have become unified. This is indeed a cause for celebration. Only when the United States, Britain, France, and other countries adopt a unified or parallel action can the aggression of Japan be effectively curbed, and the situation in the Far East stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty be maintained. (16th dispatch) [Referring to earlier discussion of imposition of high tariffs on Japanese goods, or even complete prohibition of Japanese goods entering Britain and its colonies,] a diplomatic correspondent from the Liberal Party's News Chronicle stated, "It is heard that the French government is preparing to send a similar note to Japan. Although the British note does not explicitly state that it will exert pressure on Japan financially and economically, it can be asserted that this aspect is under consideration by the government." At the same time, the newspaper published an editorial saying, "The value of this note has been greatly reduced because it was sent out so late. After the United States submitted its first note to Japan in October of last year, lodging a stern protest, it loaned China a large sum of 5,000,000 pounds. Britain could have adopted a parallel policy, but in practice, British policy and American policy are far apart." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of The Times recently commented on the British note to Japan, stating in brief that "the resistance caused by Japan's violation of other countries' rights is now gradually increasing. The meaning of the British document is clear. This was drafted before the outbreak of the Great War, and its wording has been approved by the French government. What is now undoubtedly clear is that even if Chiang Kai-shek's military operations are unsuccessful, Britain still recognizes him as the representative of China. On the other hand, the peace terms put forward by the Japanese army on the 22nd render the Nine-Power Treaty as waste paper. Now, Prime Minister Hiranuma has the opportunity to issue a more recent and satisfactory explanation. Hypothetically, Japan may not be able to correct its ambitions at this time. If so, then the British government's refusal to recognize the abolition of Chinese rights or the rights of other countries is justified. The Birmingham Post stated that this document is a major political document of the first order, containing no points of weakness and leaving no room for argument. This note regards the destruction of the Nine-Power Treaty as a direct injury to China, as well as a direct injury to the powers. This point makes people happy to read, and there are not many who can express it so appropriately and clearly on behalf of China. If Tokyo believes that Britain and the U.S. have not taken active action…"</p>
<h3>Japan Hesitates and Plans to Explain</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to reporters today when asked about the British note, stating that the Japanese side is still studying the note and cannot comment on it, and that he cannot predict when a reply can be submitted. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Asahi Shimbun stated in its editorial today that the British International Document is nothing more than an expression of the opinions of the Eastern Shen Province, indicating that the British government cannot agree with the "New Order in East Asia" claimed by the Japanese government. Regarding this issue, the Japanese side has already explained in detail to the British and American ambassadors to Japan over the past two months. Therefore, the Japanese government does not intend to reply immediately to the British and American messages. Foreign Minister Arita will meet with the British and American ambassadors again at an appropriate time to provide a more detailed explanation, and then reply to the British and American sides at an appropriate time. It should be noted that the British government's attitude towards the revision of the Nine-Power Treaty seems to be related to the opinions of the Guan Zhiniu family of the birds, and it does not seem to be the time to collapse.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Sorrow</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Chamberlain has returned to London "looking utterly dejected." He joyfully accompanied Halifax to Rome, only to be rebuffed by Mussolini. For a year, Mussolini had received huge loans from London and had been granted recognition by Britain and France for the Italian Empire. Today, he is unwilling to make any concessions. During the Anglo-Italian talks, he resolutely stated his unwillingness to change his attitude towards France, to continue withdrawing Italian volunteer troops, and demanded unconditional recognition of the Spanish rebels as a belligerent party. In short, Mussolini clearly intends to rely on the assistance of his ally—Germany—and actively pursue his insatiable desires!</p>
<p>The breakdown of these Anglo-Italian talks is a major blow to Chamberlain's policy of "appeasement," which was long expected. Since the establishment of the Anglo-Italian Agreement last April, Prime Minister Chamberlain has done everything possible to promote a policy of "appeasing Europe"—but "appeasing Europe" is merely a beautiful guise. Its real purpose is to facilitate the conclusion of a Four-Power Pact between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, so that the aggressors' blades can be turned towards the Soviet Union. For this purpose, Chamberlain has spared no expense. Under the banner of "appeasement," Austria was annexed, Italy's illegal occupation of Abyssinia was recognized, and the legitimate government of Spain was blockaded. Czechoslovakia was carved up. In short, Chamberlain's "appeasement policy" reached its peak at the Munich Conference in October of last year. The conclusion of the Munich Agreement can be said to have created the rudimentary form of a Four-Power Pact.</p>
<p>However, we have repeatedly said that there is an unbridgeable divide between fascist states and democratic states. Due to the humiliating concessions of Britain and France, the Munich Agreement forcibly constituted the "Four-Power Pact" in rudimentary form. On the other hand, as the aggressive arrogance of German and Italian fascism grew daily, the Munich Agreement also deepened the contradictions between the four powers. According to Chamberlain's wishful thinking, he originally wanted to create a balance of power under British hegemony in order to stabilize Central and Eastern Europe, and turn the aggressor's blades towards the Soviet Union. But things did not go as planned. German and Italian fascists have become increasingly powerful with Chamberlain's support. Hitler is no longer a tool that London can arbitrarily dictate, but a wild horse that has broken free of its reins. Mussolini is also making exorbitant demands on France, demanding colonies. Not to mention that France has fallen into a position of isolation, but under the intense pressure of the Berlin-Rome axis, Britain's position is also considerably weakened and isolated. Facts have long shown that Chamberlain's "appeasement" policy is unworkable. But Chamberlain still obstinately sticks to his policy of indulging the aggressors. His visit to Rome was the final effort of his appeasement policy. Now that the Anglo-Italian talks have finally broken down, it should be a good lesson for Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Open your eyes and look at the treacherous storms brewing in Europe. The flames of the aggressors' war arrogance have burned sky-high, and are about to burn to Britain's very doorstep. As Mussolini provokes France, Hungary has joined the "Anti-Comintern Pact." Hitler is long prepared to attack Britain's colonies. If Britain does not abandon its "appeasement" policy of condoning aggression and stands up straight, it will surely feel deep regret in the future when it is "too late to mend the fold."</p>
<p>Mussolini has long said: "Cannons speak louder than words." It is clear that words have no binding effect on aggressors. When the Baldwin cabinet signed the Gentleman's Agreement with Italy in January 1935, British merchant ships were soon heavily attacked by fascist naval vessels in the Mediterranean. The Anglo-Italian Agreement of last April became a dead letter as soon as it was signed. All these facts have not taught Chamberlain a lesson. He is still groping around in the same circle, not knowing how to make the count. Will he succeed?</p>
<p>Meeting force with force, and striking the aggressor in return, is the only effective way to stop fascist aggression!</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Counterattack Guangzhou: Military Arrangements Completed; Japanese Troops Attempt to Invade Guangxi via the West River: Guangdong Northern Troops Prepare to Intercept; Southern Shanxi Troops Recapture Fenglingdu</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Observers state that, judging from the Japanese army's recent series of movements, they seem to be planning to invade Guangxi via the West River. Japanese troops have already arrived in Sanshui and southwest areas, their aim being to scout Wuzhou or land at Beihai. While the actual strength of the Chinese troops within Guangdong province is not clear, since there are no battles on the Yangtze River, their navy can be mobilized to the greatest extent. Therefore, there is a strong possibility of a landing at Beihai. Bai Chongxi has returned to Guilin to coordinate everything. Coupled with the steep mountains of Guangxi, the determination of regular troops and militia to defend the country, the Japanese army will face significant difficulties if they advance westward. At the same time, the Chinese troops in northern Guangdong are prepared to launch a large-scale southward advance when the Japanese troops move westward, cutting off their transportation lines. The reason for not counterattacking yet is based on military considerations. Zhang Fakui, Li Hanhun, Ye Zhao, and Wu Qiwu have all arrived in northern Guangdong, and military arrangements for the southward attack have been completed. In the future, when the counterattack is launched, the Chinese air force will also participate, but its strength has not been announced. (Special dispatch, 12:00 PM on the 16th)</p>

<p>(Changsha) A reporter spoke to the person in charge of the provincial government yesterday, who said that after the Changsha fire, Chairman Zhang felt deeply guilty for his oversight in employing the wrong people and neglecting defense. He immediately requested punishment and was ordered by the central government to be dismissed but retained to take responsibility for the aftermath. In the past two months, the temporary relief work for the fire has been successfully completed. The Executive Yuan sent a telegram to commend the provincial government a few days ago. In the meantime, the provincial government convened a meeting of commissioners, district commanders, and county magistrates throughout the province, formulated and promulgated emergency response plans for local governments at all levels, and convened a Xiangxi security conference, setting a three-month deadline to eradicate banditry. Chairman Zhang also personally inspected various places. After returning, he expressed that the people of the entire province are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about the War of Resistance, and the military and civilians are harmonious. Chairman Zhang believes that the fire relief and emergency wartime administrative measures have come to an end. On the 30th of last month, he formally telegraphed the central government to resign, requesting the appointment of a capable successor and hoping for an early approval. However, before the reorganization order is officially promulgated, Chairman Zhang will fulfill his duty one day at a time, thoroughly implementing the purpose of serving the thirty million people until the end.

Now that temporary relief has come to an end, reconstruction must wait until after the war. I am ashamed to remain in my post and bear the trust, and I feel deeply pained in my heart.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Notifies French Foreign Minister: Rome Talks Not Bad; Italy Guarantees No Ambitions in Spain; France Regrets Failure of French-Italian Talks</h3>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Bonnet arrived here this evening and immediately had dinner with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax for talks. According to informed sources, Foreign Secretary Halifax informed Foreign Minister Bonnet that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had reiterated to the British Cabinet members that as soon as the Spanish Nationalist forces achieved final victory, Italian troops would withdraw from the Spanish mainland and the Balearic Islands. This guarantee from the Italian Prime Minister had been communicated to French Prime Minister Daladier by the British Ambassador to France, Sir Phipps. Both Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet expressed their satisfaction upon hearing this. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax also informed Foreign Minister Bonnet that the British Cabinet members had avoided discussing the disputes between Italy and France, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had not put forward any concrete demands, only explaining the position taken by Italy, which was listened to by the British Cabinet members. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) During his dinner with French Foreign Minister Bonnet this evening, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax reported on the talks with the Italian Cabinet members. Prime Minister Chamberlain obtained the consent of the Italian authorities to issue a statement to the British House of Commons, stating this matter. In addition, no part of Spanish territory, whether islands or colonies, would be governed by Italy. Prime Minister Mussolini also guaranteed that he would no longer send fresh troops to the Spanish Nationalist government forces. He also expressed regret over the news that France had supplied the Spanish Republican government with armaments, as rumored abroad. Regarding the dispute between Italy and France, the Italian Prime Minister did not make any concrete demands on France, only stating that the Italian government had intended to negotiate with France when it announced the cancellation of the Italian-French Agreement on December 26 last year, but France had not accepted it, which was regrettable. The British Cabinet members immediately explained that the atmosphere at that time was not conducive to negotiations, and if Italian anti-French propaganda could be stopped, the French government would also be happy to do so. In short, the Italian Prime Minister did not ask Britain to mediate or arbitrate. The British Cabinet members also kept their previous promises, avoiding interference on fundamental issues. Regarding the relationship between Italy and Germany, Prime Minister Mussolini did not make any special statements, but expressed his hope that the arms race could be limited and that international economic relations could be improved.

<h3>Chamberlain Returns to London, Continues Policy of Appeasement, British and Italian Views Clarified, Still Must Intensify Strengthening of National Defense</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain returned to London this afternoon. No fewer than several thousand people gathered at the train station to cheer and pay their respects. The Prime Minister still carried his "historic" umbrella, decorated with a pink flower, and smiled. After disembarking from the train, he spoke a few words to the welcoming crowd and then drove straight back to his official residence at No. 10 Downing Street. Crowds lined the streets, expressing their respect. There were also those who shouted "Rise up, Red Party!" and "Do not invade Spain!", and two people were arrested for being insulting. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately informed Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon of the situation of the British-Italian talks, and at the Cabinet meeting on the 18th of this month, he submitted a detailed report. According to people close to the government, the Prime Minister is determined to continue to pursue a policy of appeasement at all costs. He has gained a clear understanding of the views of the Italian authorities after his talks with them. In short, Italy is currently concerned with many issues: 1. Demands for French-administered Djibouti and other territories of France; 2. Participation in the management of the Suez Canal; 3. Demarcation of the border between British Somaliland, British Egypt, the Sudanese border and Italian East Africa; 4. The evolution of the Spanish civil war. None of these issues involve the interests of Britain's survival. After the talks between the British and Italian Cabinet members, the friendship between the two sides has increased, and it is possible that some of these issues may be easier to resolve. However, the result of the British-Italian talks is purely of a passive nature, which is the reality. Therefore, intensifying the strengthening of national defense is the most concerning thing for the British government in the future. This can be asserted with certainty.

<h3>Mussolini Publishes Article, Not Necessary to Be Overly Pessimistic, Nor Too Optimistic</h3>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official magazine "Diplomatic News" recently published a commentary on the talks between the British and Italian Cabinet members, which it said was obtained from responsible sources. According to the report, Prime Minister Mussolini told the British Cabinet members that once the "Red and Black" troops had been completely withdrawn from Spain and the Nationalist forces enjoyed the rights of belligerent groups, the Italian troops would withdraw from both Spain. However, if any government friendly to our Republican government were to engage in large-scale intervention, causing the non-intervention policy to be changed, then Italy would also reconsider its attitude and restore its freedom of action. Regarding the dispute between Italy and France, Prime Minister Mussolini said that Italy and France have deep differences of opinion on the Spanish issue, and a solution may be considered after the end of the Spanish civil war. From now until that time, whether to convene a three-nation conference or a four-nation conference, to mediate or arbitrate, would be futile. Based on this, the rumors circulating abroad that Italy is asking Britain to mediate are purely fabricated and extremely absurd. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned the close relations between Britain and Germany, and Prime Minister Mussolini stated that Italy's foreign policy is still based on the Rome-Berlin Axis. As for the relations between Britain and Italy, the British-Italian Agreement has been faithfully implemented by both countries, so there are no alarming issues to be discussed regarding the relations between the two countries. The British and Italian Cabinet members also discussed the possibility of the Jewish refugee issue and the limitation of armaments. The latter is still far from being realized. The conclusion stated: "According to responsible sources, after the talks between the British and Italian Cabinet members, neither excessive pessimism nor excessive optimism is appropriate. Everyone must always trust those who have good intentions to continue working to satisfy the legitimate needs of all nations, so as to stabilize peace in Europe." (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The semi-official "Diplomatic News" report on the talks between the British and Italian Cabinet members in Rome, which was said to have been written by Prime Minister Mussolini, was recently explained by a person familiar with the inside story: The evolution of Italian-German relations depends on whether the Spanish civil war can be resolved according to Germany's wishes. According to Italian sources, this commentary is a warning to a certain country not to provide large-scale assistance to the Spanish Republican government in the "last hour," otherwise Italy will also restore its freedom of action and be unwilling to intervene, so that the Nationalist forces can obtain final victory.

<h3>Chamberlain Thanks Mussolini by Telegram</h3>
<p>(Rome) British Prime Minister Chamberlain has telegraphed Mussolini, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome he received in Italy. The telegram stated: "Upon my return, my confidence in British-Italian friendship and our mutual hope to maintain peace has been strengthened." Mussolini telegraphed back, saying, "I am happy to reiterate that Your Excellency and Lord Halifax's visit to Rome has proven that British-Italian friendship is resolved and that I believe in upholding justice and maintaining peace." British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also exchanged telegrams, with similar wording to those of Chamberlain and Mussolini. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Daladier Announces Policy of Peace and National Defense, Willing to Negotiate with Italy, Radical Party Expresses Confidence</h3>
<p>(Paris) The executive committees of the Radical Socialist Party's members of parliament, and leaders of branches everywhere held a joint meeting here this month. Prime Minister Daladier, who is also the party leader, delivered a speech, appealing for national unity to cope with foreign crises and defend the integrity of the colonial empire. The representatives then unanimously passed a resolution expressing confidence in the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's speech and the resolutions of the joint meeting are detailed below: (1) Prime Minister Daladier said, "For more than ten months, the government has had to fight against malicious people within the country and deal with external difficulties. Whenever the government's position is threatened or weakened internally, external crises expand accordingly. Fortunately, in these ten months, we have been able to overcome internal disturbances and reunite the national strength, thereby showing the world our determination. However, this situation cannot be allowed to continue unchanged. The crisis and difficulties in Italy and Germany are just beginning. The government has the authority to require the people to end internal political disputes to protect the interests and integrity of the country and its colonial territories. The government has decided to do everything possible to prevent major disasters from breaking out and to prevent Western civilization from being destroyed. But we cannot tolerate the forcible or cunning seizure of France's current position and interests." In short, the government's foreign policy is a "policy of peace and national defense." As for domestic affairs, the Popular Front, originally a set of negotiated terms between the working class and the propertied class, has caused much friction because the propertied class believes it has been sacrificed. It should be known that if the middle class in a country feels disappointed, it is not beneficial to the country. The cases of Germany and Italy can serve as a lesson. It is always necessary to do everything possible to avoid social unrest. The lesson is always the same. Even though the trade unions launched a general strike on November 30 last year, Italy began to express its opposition on that day. If the general strike had not been stopped in time, the impact would have been unimaginable." After the Prime Minister finished speaking, the Socialist Senator and foreign affairs expert, Mr. Berto, expressed his sympathy for the government's current policy and urged the government, after consulting with the British, to take all appropriate measures to deal with the threat from Italy. "If Italy were to occupy the Spanish Balearic Islands and threaten the traffic of the French mainland and its North African territories, the colonial empire would be finished." (2) The joint meeting then unanimously passed a resolution with eight points, namely: 1. To commend the firm and compromising policy pursued by Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet. The goal of this policy is to maintain peace while not abandoning national interests. 2. To express regret that the major countries have failed to heed public opinion and establish a general agreement. 3. Regarding the French-Italian issue, France can negotiate with Italy if the general atmosphere improves, but on the condition that territorial concessions are not involved. 4. To urge the government to pay attention to the situation caused by Italy's interference in the Spanish civil war and its occupation of Spanish territory and the Balearic Islands. 5. Regarding domestic affairs, the joint meeting passed two resolutions, one expressing trust in the government's actions and urging the people to unite to support the government, and the other advocating the revision of the electoral system.

<h3>British Labour Leader Criticizes Prime Minister, Believes in Over-Reliance on Dictators</h3>
<p>Westminster. Major Clement Attlee, leader of the British opposition Labour Party, delivered a speech here this afternoon criticizing Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's trip to Rome, stating that the Prime Minister's trip achieved nothing. "Since the Prime Minister returned from Munich in September of last year, he has stated that he believes Hitler has good intentions, but advocating for increased armaments is inherently contradictory. Since returning from Rome, he says he deeply believes in the sincerity of the Italian government. Considering what Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has done in the past, we find it difficult to trust his promises. Taking the Spanish Civil War as an example, Italy consistently spoke of a non-intervention policy, while simultaneously actively intervening. Now, Italian newspapers are freely criticizing France, and French troops are concentrated in East Africa at Barr el Murri and Lugh Ferrandi. The British people have the right to demand that the government inform them of the truth of the situation. The truth is that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler are pursuing an aggressive policy in Europe. The British people welcome good relations with the German and Italian people, but it is impossible to ignore reality and insist that the other side is sincere. There is a country whose army is attacking British merchant ships, bombing British sailors, and killing workers and children without remorse. The British Prime Minister personally went to visit. This is not appropriate for British interests or world peace," he said. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Catalonia Front: Government Troops in General Retreat, Nationalist Troops Enter Barcelona Province, 35 Miles from Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>Barcelona. The Republican government's Ministry of National Defense recently issued a communique stating that the Catalan autonomous region's front-line troops were ordered by the commander-in-chief today to retreat voluntarily to Tarragona to defend the important positions east of Valls and Tarragona. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Barcelona. Government troops have retreated entirely from the front line of the Catalan autonomous region to defend new positions. The situation is very good. All weapons were taken away and there were no major losses. The local communists distributed leaflets, demanding that all residents be incorporated into the military authorities to defend Catalonia with all their might. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Lérida. According to a Havas correspondent in Tarragona, Nationalist troops captured Tarragona today using an encirclement tactic. Their vanguard reached the Gaià River and then attacked Tarragona. Another unit detoured to the north to encircle the city. Government troops could not withstand the attack and retreated while fighting. The Nationalist mechanized units rushed into the city at 12:30 PM. By 2 PM, they had completely occupied the city. Among the residents who did not flee, there were more than 10,000 elderly, weak, women, and children. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>San Sebastián de los Reyes. The Nationalist Army Headquarters recently issued a battle report stating, "Our troops in Catalonia captured the important towns of Tarragona and Reus this afternoon, as well as 82 nearby villages. The vanguard has already advanced to the Gaià River, only 60 kilometers from Barcelona. The area occupied by our troops totals 1,650 square kilometers. Since the start of the general offensive in late December of last year, our troops have occupied 7,225 square kilometers of land on the Catalan front." Tarragona is located on the Mediterranean coast, 70 kilometers from Barcelona, and is strategically important. In addition, a Nationalist detachment invaded Barcelona province near Coloma yesterday. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Lérida. The Nationalist Navarre Fifth Brigade has entered Tarragona. At the same time, General Yagüe's headquarters announced that the Nationalist forces have completely occupied Tarragona and Reus. Another Nationalist force has advanced to the Gaià River. It is reported that the Nationalist force on the road north of Barcelona has entered the province of Barcelona near Coloma, only 35 miles from Barcelona. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Madrid. At dawn yesterday, government troops took the offensive along the Tagus River, driving Nationalist troops from a certain village on the north bank. Another government force crossed the river near a village 25 miles from Toledo. According to semi-official sources, government troops have continued to make progress on the Extremadura front near Badajoz, capturing Ovidiuona and other places, and advancing to the vicinity of Hervás. Government troops also repelled a Nationalist counter-attack in the Rubielos de Mora area further north. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Hiranuma Kiichirō Elaborates on Benevolent Rule, Does Not Require Totalitarianism</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiranuma stated on the train yesterday that Japan does not desire nor need to implement totalitarianism. Totalitarianism and individualism have long been integrated into benevolent rule and have become the guiding principle of Japanese politics. The term "benevolent rule" was advocated by Emperor Meiji. Japanese politicians must adhere to it when conducting domestic and foreign policy. Therefore, Japanese politics must be rooted in benevolent rule. If everyone follows benevolent rule and supports the Imperial Family, the nation will be united and stability will be achieved. The Prime Minister then criticized political parties, stating that he must ensure that Japanese political parties are based on benevolent rule, unite with the nation, and loyally support the Imperial Family. Japanese political parties are different from Western political parties. Western political parties arise from conflicts of interest. Japanese political parties must have the welfare of the Imperial Family at heart. Therefore, those who abandon righteousness for profit must be severely condemned. The Prime Minister frankly admitted that he intended to organize a new political organization. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiranuma has requested the resignation of the entire cabinet of the new cabinet organization, but has retained all the councilors. These include former Speaker of the House of Representatives Akita, President of the South Manchuria Railway Company Matsuoka, President of the Seiyūkai party Hatoyama, President of the North China Development Company Ayukawa, and the President of the Japan Economic Federation. The current Minister of Home Affairs, Suetsugu, has accepted the position of cabinet councilor. The government is now also asking former Minister of Finance Ikeda to serve as a cabinet councilor. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Konoe's appointment as President of the Privy Council and Minister without Portfolio in the government has caused great discussion in government and political circles. The Privy Council Ordinance clearly stipulates that members of the Privy Council may not interfere in government administrative matters. Therefore, there is speculation that Konoe has no specifically designated administrative affairs to handle, but he can be summoned to the Diet to answer questions. Political circles here believe that if Konoe actually attends the Diet, he will attend as Minister without Portfolio, so that his attendance will not violate the Privy Council Ordinance.

<h3>Japanese Trade Declines, Imports and Exports Both Decrease by 21.2 Percent</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Ministry of Finance, Japan's overseas trade in 1938 had a surplus of 60,498,000 yen (compared to a deficit of 35,906,000 yen in 1937). Exports from Japan proper, Korea, Taiwan, and mandated territories amounted to 2,896,707,000 yen, while imports amounted to 2,836,209,000 yen, totaling 5,732,916,000 yen. Compared with 1937, exports decreased by 12.7 percent, imports decreased by 28.3 percent, and both items together decreased by 1,540,630,000 yen, or 21.2 percent. In the past few years, Japan had been working hard to expand its overseas textile market. However, since the establishment of the wartime economic structure in the second half of 1937 and the implementation of strict controls on overseas trade, the situation has changed drastically. As a result, textile exports have been declining since the beginning of last year, with cotton products being the most affected. Their total exports were 40,239,000 yen, a decrease of 168,826,000 yen compared to 1937. However, exports of machinery and paper have increased. Exports of food, such as flour and canned goods, have also been very strong. The former were transported to countries allied with Japan, while the latter were marketed in Europe. In addition, exports of canned seafood have also increased. Raw material exports have fallen sharply, totaling 669,963,000 yen, a decrease of 144,628,000 yen compared to 1937. The main reason is the sharp decline in exports of raw silk and rayon. The total value of Japan's two largest exports, cotton textiles and raw silk, was 768,363,000 yen, accounting for 25 percent of Japan's total exports. The total export value of these two items decreased by 211,820,000 yen compared to the previous year, accounting for nearly half of the total export decrease in 1937, which dealt a major blow to Japan's overseas trade. Japan's imports have also fallen sharply. The main reason is the sharp decrease in the two major import items, raw cotton and wool. In 1938, the total import value of these two items was 331,262,000 yen. Although the government wanted to reduce imports of other items, it failed to achieve the desired effect. However, the actual decrease in the above attached items was considered satisfactory. Imports of leather, rubber, lumber, and other less important items have also decreased significantly. Trading merchants believe that the trade controls required for the war with China have resulted in the loss of many transactions. The slight import surplus mentioned above was first seen since 1918, but it actually included trade with countries allied with Japan and had nothing to do with foreign currencies. If we consider the import surplus actually obtained from trade with third countries, the amount is only 850,000,000 yen. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>"Caporetto"</p>
<p>Paris. The street nameplates in the capital city that resembled those of cities in Italy were dismantled by a large crowd last night and replaced with square pieces of white paper bearing the word "Caporetto." The "Roma" station of the underground railway was also renamed "Caporetto." The Public Works Bureau sent people to tear off these pieces of white paper today, explaining that "Caporetto was originally part of Austria-Hungary before the European War. After the war, it was assigned to Italy. The German-Austrian forces heavily defeated the Italian army there on October 24, 1917." (Havas, 15th)</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Replies to Tan Kah Kee, The National Policy of Resistance Will Not Change, Hopes Overseas Chinese Will Unite to Exert Efforts and Support; Wang Jingwei Has Already Been dealt with and Announcement Made</h3>
<p>Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the South Seas China Relief Fund, urgently telegraphed the Chongqing Chairman Chiang regarding reports of Wang Jingwei's treacherous declaration, announcing Wang's crimes and requesting that he be apprehended and brought to justice to rectify the country. Chairman Chiang replied, stating that resistance is the established national policy and will not change. He hopes that the overseas Chinese will unite, exert efforts, and provide support. The full text of the original telegram is transcribed below:</p>
<p>1.  Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram: To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, disregarding disgrace, openly agrees with the Japanese bandits' conditions for the subjugation of the country. His actions are not only a traitor to the Premier but also a national traitor to the Chinese nation. Your Lushan declaration, resisting to the end, has been supported by the whole country and has become an ironclad case of resistance to Japan. Compromise midway is tantamount to destruction. Jingwei deeply knows this meaning. The recent resolution of the National Political Council states that civil servants who advocate for peace midway are traitors. As the Speaker of the Council, how could he have turned a deaf ear? He dared to abandon his post and leave the capital, betraying the party and the country, as if saying that the puppet regime in Nanjing has a high seat reserved for him, and no one else is worthy? If this is not punished, how can we encourage the people and how can we eradicate the effects? We respectfully request that you announce his crimes and issue an arrest warrant to bring him to justice, rectify the national laws, and stabilize the hearts of the people. The millions of overseas Chinese support resistance to the end. Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief Fund for Refugees of the National Crisis, respectfully kowtows (31st day).</p>
<p>2.  Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's reply: To Mr. Chen Jiageng, your telegram has been received. The Central Government has already taken action and an announcement has been made, which you should have already read. We must strive for the victory of resistance and the integrity of national sovereignty and territory. This is the established national policy and will not change. I hope you will convey this to the overseas Chinese, and that they will unite, exert efforts, and provide support. Chiang Zhongzheng (4th day), Secretarial Seal in Chongqing.</p>

<h3>Fighting Near Yingcheng and Zao City</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, fighting took place yesterday northwest of Yingcheng and southwest of Zao City on the Hanyi Highway. In recent days, Japanese planes have been constantly flying over Chinese army positions to reconnoiter and drop bombs. The Japanese troops in Yingcheng are continuously moving westward, seemingly with the intention of advancing westward. (Express News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Most of Japanese Troops in Tongcheng Withdraw Northward</h3>
<p>Pingjiang. Most of the Japanese troops stationed in Tongcheng have withdrawn northward. There are only about 300 Japanese troops left in the city. In recent days, Chinese guerrilla teams have been constantly attacking and sweeping, and Japanese aid lines of communication and communication networks have been cut off from time to time. Small groups of Japanese troops have also been annihilated from time to time. Therefore, the Japanese troops in the city have been closing the city gates all day long, not daring to go out.

<h3>Chairman Lin's Report at the Joint Memorial Week: Firm Belief, First Eliminate the Psychology of Doubt</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Central National Government held a joint memorial week for the Premier on the morning of the 16th. More than 500 members of the Central Committee, heads of various ministries, and senior officials attended. The ceremony was conducted as usual, and Chairman Lin reported on "Firm Belief, First Eliminate the Psychology of Doubt." It has been exactly one year and six months since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. In this year and a half of the sacred war of resistance, the enemy has forcibly occupied many of our transportation areas, massacred countless of our compatriots, and sacrificed and plundered our countless properties and fortunes. Such a vicious method is still continuing to invade us under the fierce and brutal command of the enemy. How should we recognize this unprecedentedly serious situation, how should we establish our strong will, endure this bitterness, work harder, and fight the violent Japanese to the end, so as to recover our lost territory and sovereignty and protect the permanent life of our nation? Now that the War of Resistance has entered the second stage, psychological construction is very important. Although the psychology of the majority of the soldiers and people of the country is as firm as gold and stone, there are still a very small number of people who do not have a clear understanding and whose will is not firm, who may have doubts about the future of the War of Resistance. Because doubt will shake their belief. Today, I specially put forward this topic (Firm Belief, First Eliminate the Psychology of Doubt) to contribute some ideas to everyone. Estimating the enemy's strength too high and the international assistance received is not much. This is the doubt psychology that is easily developed by those with "fear of Japan." Now I will explain the actual situation that I have investigated clearly from all aspects to correct their wrong ideas. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in North China Suppressing British and French Concessions in Tianjin; Forcing Japanese Merchants Within Both Concessions to Withdraw; Tianjin's Future Depends on European Events</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports: Yesterday (the 10th), according to a foreign resident arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin, since occupying Tianjin, the Japanese army has been restricting British and other foreign commercial activities. Japanese merchants in Tianjin are in a state of panic over the order issued by their military authorities requiring all Japanese residents to withdraw from the British and French concessions, as this move will cause them significant economic losses. Although the Japanese military authorities issued this order a month ago, they immediately discovered that the order could not be implemented as easily as initially anticipated. Currently, major Japanese commercial entities such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line), and Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK Lines) all possess valuable buildings and properties within the "restricted" area. Although it is said that their offices will have to relocate by the end of this month, they remain within the concessions for now and have not moved. At the same time, roads connecting the concessions to the outside world have been barricaded by the Japanese military authorities, but commerce within the concessions continues as usual. The original intention of the Japanese was to isolate the two concessions in Tianjin and then order the Japanese residents to withdraw. However, no decisive action has been taken to achieve this goal. After the Japanese military authorities issued the order, Japanese businesses with valuable properties within the two concessions are indeed facing losses upon withdrawal. After leaving the concessions, their properties will naturally be of no use to them. Currently, smaller Japanese businesses and individually operated Japanese merchants have already withdrawn from the concessions. If the Japanese residents can completely withdraw, unless the Japanese can prevent foreign ships from reaching the rivers along the British and French concessions, this would be akin to disregarding the goose and cutting off its nose. If the Japanese want to prevent foreign ships from sailing to Tianjin and cut off this trade route, it cannot be done without force. The commercial situation in the concessions is not as bleak as the Japanese portray it, but foreign businesses have undoubtedly suffered losses after the Japanese implemented restrictions. This is most evident in the export of general goods. However, the Japanese are transporting a large amount of salt, coal, and iron ore to Japan, with Japanese ships accounting for 70% of the transportation, and the rest being transported by British and other foreign ships. Last year, imports were quite sluggish, but this year, a large number of American and Australian goods are expected to be imported. Maritime trade between Tianjin and South China has been cut off since the fall of Guangzhou, but trade with Shantou seems to be flourishing. The nature of Japanese goods being imported cannot be determined due to the lack of records. Although most Japanese goods should be subject to customs duties, the Japanese often claim they are importing military supplies. The Japanese authorities had stated their intention to move the Tianjin Customs from the French concession to the Japanese concession, but according to the latest information, the Tianjin Customs remains in the French concession. A branch office will be set up in the former German concession, and goods imported from the guerrilla areas will be handled by this branch office. Barricades have been erected at the borders of the British and French concessions. Foreign residents passing through are required to display transit passes or identification documents, which is somewhat inconvenient. As for the Chinese, the restrictions are stricter. Pedestrians, rickshaw drivers, and other forms of transport are all subject to inspection, causing severe traffic congestion. The journey to the train station via the Wan Guo Bridge is often delayed due to traffic congestion caused by inspections at the bridgehead. One method the Japanese are using to suppress British trade in Tianjin is to subject all foreign ships entering Tianjin to medical inspections, often causing indefinite delays to British ships. However, this is still not as severe as the detention of ships in Qingdao. Carts carrying vegetables and food are allowed to pass through the barricades, so although the price of food in the concessions has increased significantly, there is certainly no shortage. The Japanese often claim that Chinese terrorists are hiding in the British and French concessions, which is not true. There have been several bombing incidents in the two concessions, but investigations by the police have confirmed that the bombers were not acting on the instructions of the Chinese authorities. On the other hand, several fires and bombings have occurred in the Japanese concession, but no clues have been found. The Japanese restrictions began to be implemented during the European crisis, so the foreign resident believes that the Japanese intend to seize the two concessions in the event of war in Europe. Once the European crisis ends, the situation in Tianjin will also improve. Therefore, the future of Tianjin depends on European events. If Germany becomes isolated in Europe, the situation in Tianjin will change completely. Tianjin and Shanghai are not comparable, the Japanese are restricting foreigners alike, but the people are doing their best to cope with it.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Under Japanese Occupation: Bandits Openly Sell Stolen Goods; British and French Trading Firms in Shamian Close Down</h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: The East River, West River and North River areas of Guangdong Province have not yet entered a stage of intense warfare. However, Chinese guerrilla troops are active in various villages. This type of mobile warfare does not seem to have had a significant impact on the situation in Guangzhou. As a result, the Japanese have been actively attempting to restore order in the occupied areas in recent months, seeking to revitalize the market and collect taxes. However, after several attempts, only three or four districts within the city of Guangzhou are somewhat populated. The First Ford in Xiguan is the most prosperous of these districts. The general poor people and hawkers and coolies gather here, and most of them sell daily necessities here. Small shops such as butcher shops, low-grade restaurants, beef noodle shops, vegetable stalls, and antique shops all open early in the morning. The First Ford street has now become a market for the poor, and the hawkers form a team every day and venture to nearby villages to collect pigs, cattle, fish and vegetables for demand and the profits are doubled. For example, a type of fresh fish purchased for 20 cents per catty in Pingzhou Township, Nanhai County, can be sold for 40 cents per catty when shouldered to Guangzhou. There is even more profit to be made from other pigs and cattle. Therefore, before dawn every day, one can see these hawkers in an endless stream on the road from Pingzhou to Baihedong Township. In addition to the First Ford Market in Guangzhou, there is also Longjin Road in Upper Xiguan. On both sides of this road, the sidewalks are lined with vegetable and miscellaneous stalls during the morning and evening market periods. In the desolate city of Guangzhou, it can also be called a bustling market. This place has already become a food supply hub for the area of Lower Xiguan. As for the markets in the city, Huifu West Road and Zhonghua Middle Road are currently the most densely populated, because many handicraft districts are nearby. Woodworkers, toothbrush workers, and jade carvers all live in this area. Most of these people were unable to move away when Guangzhou fell, so fewer of their residences were looted. When the Japanese troops entered the city, the entire city was looted, and the stolen goods were piled up by bandits on Huifu West Road and Zhonghua Middle Road, and sold at low prices, which was heartbreaking. Generally, people with frozen blood took advantage of the cheap price and openly bought them and resold them in various villages to make huge profits. The Japanese army often indirectly protects the bandits, which further fuels their desire to steal and plunder. The fact that thefts occur in Guangzhou every night is a major reason for this. Recently, the Japanese puppets have organized the street self-defense groups into temporary police, paying them a few cents a day to maintain law and order. However, it is just a name and not reality, and the locations where there are police are limited to slightly more prosperous areas. In addition, law and order in other areas is still chaotic. More than two months have passed since the fall of Guangzhou. In the occupied areas, people are cut off from the outside world. Those who communicate with Hong Kong and Macau must send them by special messengers at great expense. In order to attract citizens back to the cloth shop, the Japanese are now restoring the post office and setting up an office in a certain cinema in Xidi (the original Guangdong Postal Administration Bureau has been burned down), so Guangzhou and Hong Kong and Macao can be reached in three days. The city is not as isolated as it used to be.</p>
<p>As for the shipping between the province and Hong Kong, it has not yet been restored. Those who come to and from the province and Hong Kong must take the route through Macau, Qianshan, Jiangmen, Shunde, and to Pingzhou, Nanhai County. However, to follow the land to Henan and cross the river to enter the city requires three or four days one way, and a round trip is not possible in a week. Yesterday, it was reported that the Hong Kong government has agreed with the Japanese to resume shipping between the province and Hong Kong. Three days ago, the Jinshan ship first went to Guangzhou to explore the waterway. If there are no obstacles, British commercial ships will resume sailing between the province and Hong Kong in the future. But whether it can be put into practice is still a problem. The Japanese do not really intend to open the Pearl River waterway, but intend to use this to undermine the interests of European countries in South China, and take the opportunity to restore Japan's commercial market in South China. The Shamian Concession is originally within the sphere of influence of Britain and France. Now that business in Guangzhou has completely stopped, the British business lines in Shamian have also closed down. Only the Japanese business lines in the British Concession are booming. Japanese merchants are swinging among them, and they are very proud of themselves. Taiwan Bank, Mitsui Bank, and Japanese transport companies have reopened their doors one after another. There was originally a Chinese Telegraph Bureau in Shamian. Now the Japanese are trying to force the bureau to move to the inland, but there is no way to do it. There are few British residents in Shemian, except for the staff of the consulate. On the contrary, Japanese people are constantly coming and going. In this situation, the Japanese in the British and French concessions in Shamian are very likely to make a riot and seize power. Therefore, Britain has recently repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese authorities, demanding to open the Pearl River waterway and plan to revive British commerce in South China. (January 10th)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Opens Zhejiang-Guangxi Through Train; First Train Departed on the 9th and Arrived in Guilin on the 13th</h3>
<p>Jinhua correspondence: The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is the only complete railway after the war of resistance, and it is now a transportation artery that inland passengers and goods are accustomed to. Now, in order to facilitate passenger and freight transportation, the road is actively preparing for the opening of the Zhejiang-Guangxi Joint Transportation Train. The train has been scheduled to depart from Jinhua at 12:00 AM on the morning of the 9th to Guilin. The passengers were quite crowded. It is planned to attach seven vehicles, including first and second class, second class, third class, sleeper car and dining car. Except for a short stop at major stations along the way, it will drive straight to Guangxi Province. It is expected to arrive at Guilin Station at 9:30 AM on the 13th, which will take a total of 80 hours. Ordinary passenger tickets are sold for 22 yuan, eight jiao and five fen. Two trains will be run every week thereafter, on Mondays and Fridays. Those who leave Guilin to Zhejiang will depart from Guilin at 19:00 and arrive in Jin four days later at 2:20 PM. The scheduled departure dates are twice on Wednesdays and Sundays.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Fully Occupies Ports in Tongzhou and Rugao, Monopolizing Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Rugao correspondence: Since the fall of Tongzhou and Rugao, the ports of Xinsheng, Zhanghuang, and Tiansheng have all been occupied by the Japanese army. However, merchants are allowed to enter and exit the ports of Niantuo, Xiaoli, and Siyu, which are stationed by the Hu army. The Japanese army intends to manage the two ports of Xinsheng and Zhanghuang, lure merchants, and from time to time burn the passengers and goods of the Chinese army stationed in the port with steamships, both threatening and intimidating. It burned the port of Zhouwu last month, intending to force the passengers and goods to enter through the two ports of Xinzhang and Rugao in order to increase tax revenue. At dawn on the 14th of this month, hundreds of Japanese people advanced westward from Pingchao in Nantong. First, they occupied the Jiangjie Bridge, and then occupied the ports of Niantuo and Siyu, and stationed themselves in the area of Yingfang Port. They had a lot of steel cannons and military equipment, and they showed off by firing guns and cannons. The residents fled in droves. The guerrilla team, due to the disparity in numbers, held the four suburbs and waited for an opportunity to counterattack. It is said that the Japanese army is digging trenches and building fortifications in Niantuo Port and other places, and has not burned civilian houses, which seems to be a permanent residence. If it expands for a long time and does not leave, then there will be no place in Tongzhou and Rugao to safely enter and exit, and shipping will almost be in the hands of the Japanese army. On the 15th, the British merchant Huang Xiao ship sailed from Shanghai to Zhou, but due to the chaos along the river, it was inconvenient to load and unload, so the passengers and cargo were returned to Shanghai on the original ship.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Department of Education Stipulates Fee Standards for Middle Schools; Shanghai Area May Increase Appropriately</h3>
<p>(Huaiyin correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education recently found that the fees charged by middle schools in Jiangsu Province were inconsistent, so it specifically submitted a proposal to the provincial government meeting to stipulate the standards for private secondary schools in Jiangsu Province to collect fees, in order to follow and abide by them. The standards are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Tuition Fee: Junior high school: 10 yuan; Senior high school: 20 yuan. The Shanghai area may increase appropriately, but the junior high school tuition fee shall not exceed 25 yuan, and the senior high school tuition fee shall not exceed 30 yuan.

(3) Sports Fee: 1 yuan. (4) Library and Medical Fee: 1 yuan to 2 yuan. (5) Medical Fee: 1 yuan to 2 yuan; Miscellaneous Fee: 2 yuan. The Shanghai area may increase appropriately, but the total shall not exceed 5 yuan. Compensation for Damages Reserve Fund: 5 yuan. For the above fees, except for the third and eighth items, which shall be settled and refunded or paid at the end of the semester, the remaining fees shall not be refunded at the end of the semester. If the school's classes are less than one semester, and the school is suspended due to enemy interference, the various fees collected shall be calculated and refunded on a monthly average basis. Furthermore, schools shall not collect any other fees outside of the stipulated fees.</p>
<h3>After Yangzhou Becomes a Guerrilla Zone, Japanese Side Implements Enslavement Education; Establishes Elementary Schools to Teach Japanese; Central Education Continues as Usual</h3>
<p>(Yangzhou correspondence) In Yangzhou, which has been occupied for a year, the Japanese are actively implementing enslavement education in order to poison the children, youth, and ignorant masses of the Chinese people. They are deeply committed. Here, the situation of slave education and the education measures implemented under the control of the central government will be explored separately.</p>
<p>When Yangcheng became a guerrilla zone, most of the education community retreated with the army. A few primary school teachers who were unable to escape were trapped in the city. When the local puppet organization appeared, the Japanese army ordered the establishment of a pseudo "Acculturation Department" (now renamed pseudo "Education Bureau") to summon these unemployed teachers who had no way to make a living and to reorganize schools. Starting this spring, five junior elementary schools and five senior elementary schools were opened in cooperation with these people and the Japanese. The funds were borne by the pseudo "Association". The teaching subjects were old Chinese (the content has been completely revised), moral cultivation, and Japanese, etc. The Japanese language subject was taught by Japanese people. In addition, the Boy Scout education was abolished, which was completely a strategy to weaken the young Chinese citizens. At first, the parents of the students were unwilling to have their disciples accept such slave education, but after being repeatedly urged by the pseudo-organization, they had no choice but to submit. Only those children with the hearts of innocence, the older they are, the clearer their minds. Although Japanese teachers always feed them medicine and play with them to eliminate their national concept, they will never succeed. In the summer, several students in a certain elementary school shouted the slogans "Down with Japanese imperialism" and "Support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek" during class. The school principal and teachers, who were quite hostile to the enemy, were shocked and expelled these students and blamed their parents. Most parents of students were deeply afraid of causing trouble for this in the future, and dared not order their children to enter school, so many taught themselves at home, or set up private schools.</p>
<p>As for middle schools, the Japanese army and the puppet government also initially planned to establish two schools. However, since almost all teachers, staff, and young students from various schools have fled outside and there is no way to recruit them, the school buildings of Yangzhong and other schools in the province were devastated when the Japanese troops entered the city, and all school equipment was gone, making it difficult to restore. The matter was dropped, and another Japanese language cram school was established to attract unemployed youth in the city to study Japanese, which in the future could be exploited by the Japanese to cultivate and dream of a certain influence. In addition, there are people in the church who founded a Shengjing Middle School, and the materials are excellent, and the young people are very weak.</p>
<p>The Japanese side also attaches importance to the so-called "social education" and has a touring movie team that has performed in Yangxian, Shaoxian, and other places. The content of the performances is extremely disgusting and intentionally propagandistic, with the aim of poisoning the local people. The pseudo-society also founded a Chinese newspaper, named "Jiangbei Daily", which publishes absurd news and exaggerates things. Those who are ignorant of the facts secretly read the phosphor newspaper in order to get the correct news. This newspaper is brought in by newspaper vendors every day, with a small number of sheets selling for several cents or a dime, and the prices are endlessly disputed. Later, after being found out by the Japanese, the newspaper vendors were severely punished, which was also a tragedy. Finally, the situation in the townships under the jurisdiction of the Jiangdu County Magistrate is described. Primary schools all hold classes as usual, and the teachers receive a low-limit living allowance. The children's string sounds are not reported, and education is greater than before. In the middle school section, the provincial Yangzhong has relocated to Shanghai and Taixian, and the private Yangzhong is in Fanchuan, on the border of Yangtai. In addition, there is a provincial-run high school in Jiangyan Town, Taixian County. Most of the teachers and students are former members of Yangzhou Normal School, so middle school students from various schools in Yangcheng have been placed outside. Few students are asking for a smile, and there are a few who have no ability to laugh. Those who are willing to go outside enter the cram schools set up privately in the townships to study, and still do not lose their opportunity to study.</p>

<h3>Fujian Middle School Suspension and Reinstatement Restriction Measures</h3>
<p>The Department of Education Ordered All Middle Schools to Follow</p>
<p>(Yongan correspondence) The Fujian Department of Education has formulated measures to restrict the reinstatement of students who have suspended their studies in middle schools and issued instructions to all middle schools in the province: It is found that students in middle or normal schools may request to suspend their studies for one semester or one school year due to special circumstances of physical or family reasons. The amended middle school regulations and the amended normal school regulations have clearly stipulated this. However, during the war of resistance, various schools have their own arrangements, and there are countless requests for suspension of studies, and the ridge cannot be gnawed, and students who fail to return to school on time should be given some leniency to help them. The following regulations are hereby formulated in accordance with the regulations and with reference to the actual situation: Students who request to suspend their studies shall, in accordance with the regulations, be limited to a maximum of one school year in principle. However, if they are unable to resume their studies after the suspension period due to special circumstances, they may continue to request to suspend their studies for one semester or one school year. Students who request to suspend their studies must undergo a grade placement test when requesting to resume their studies, and may resume their studies after passing the test. Those who have suspended their studies and have not requested to continue their suspension, or who have continued to suspend their studies and have not resumed their studies, shall not be allowed to resume their studies in the future. The suspension and resumption of studies in vocational schools shall be handled in accordance with the above provisions. In addition to separate orders, they shall be transported.</p>

<h3>Ma Gongyu and Others Open Huaying Girls' High School</h3>
<p>Shanghai Chinese and Western education celebrities Ma Gongyu and Dr. Wilson, etc., in view of the large number of high-end residents in the western part of the city, and the lack of appropriate girls' schools, initiated the establishment of Huaying Girls' High School and affiliated primary school, located in the southern end of Mail West Road Xiafei Road, with convenient transportation and a quiet environment. The reporter specially visited and saw that the school buildings are spacious, with sufficient light, complete equipment, and the large size of the sports field is the most rare in the current special zone where land is as valuable as gold. The faculty members are all knowledgeable and experienced people, and the management and teaching take a strict approach, with equal emphasis on Chinese and science. English is taught by British people, allowing students to make progress easily. According to the chairman Ma Gong and Principal Zhou Linzhi, it took a lot of effort to prepare this school and it took half a year to complete. It has now been submitted to the central management education authorities for filing. Since the enrollment of this semester, the number of students entering the school has been very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>School Overview / Zhengguang Middle School</h3>
<p>In the summer of 1938, Zhengguang Middle School, which had a strong reputation in this city, announced its closure. The school's educators, Meng Xixun, Fei Bili, Guo Zhishi, Zhu Hongting, Bu Saihuai, Lin Zhenxian, Xu Zongjun, Chen Lixing, and others, in response to the requests of numerous students and their parents, reorganized the school. They used the Hong Kong Yingzhuan Shanghai Branch School on Avenue Edward VII as the school site and named it Hong Kong Middle School. Their purpose was to enhance the good foundation of young people's knowledge and moral character. Meng Xixun was appointed as the principal. Later, due to the small school building and the increasing number of students, the school moved to No. 210, Gordon Road. Recently, they hired Yuan Yudeng, Wei Ziai, He Bingzhao, Dan Shiliang, Wu Ruilan, Ji Lunfang, Kuo Fenyi, Ni Puli, Xiang Gujin, Zhi Biaoqun, and Bu Qingru as teachers. They organized a school board and renamed the school Zhengguang, meaning to promote and glorify the teaching spirit of Zhengguang in the past. They have submitted an application to the Ministry of Education of the National Government for registration, and all procedures have been completed.</p>
<p>The school is organized into junior and senior high school departments, as well as general science classes and senior high school civil engineering classes. Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry are the main subjects. Emphasis is placed on daily tutoring. Engineering classes focus on surveying, drafting, and other subjects. Monthly exams are held three times each semester, and students' academic and moral conduct are reported to parents at any time. Students with excellent academic performance are not only listed on the honor roll but also receive separate awards. Students who rank first in the semester exam in the highest grade will also be exempt from tuition fees for the next semester. Moral education is also implemented through the mentor system, focusing on encouragement. Those who violate school rules will be severely punished. Furthermore, to promote students' extracurricular knowledge, in addition to requiring extracurricular reading of books and newspapers, a lecture topic is prepared every week, and famous figures from various fields are invited to the school to give lectures. As a result, all students in the school are diligent and motivated, with thriving interests. It is rumored that the school will expand its school building, purchase books and equipment, and enrich various facilities in the upcoming semester.</p>

<h3>Dissection</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>I have always found it strange that the Chinese people boast to the world of being a peace-loving nation and tirelessly declare this to others, even to robbers, again and again. The only meaning of this, apart from saying "Spare me!" or indicating "I am utterly powerless," seems to be without reason.</p>
<p>The actions of all clever people in the world often lead them to admire their own clever methods, momentarily delighted and satisfied; but later, they find themselves at a loss, or even realize that they are foolish. Even if not, even if they are clever throughout their lives, time will tell them that their methods are foolish. Because they have forgotten "human nature."</p>
<p>Speaking of loving peace, who doesn't love peace? But you must not forget that loving war is also "human nature" - it is a fact! Just as promoting kindness and goodness is a virtue, but human nature tends to enjoy revealing secrets and exposing ugliness; striving for progress is what ambitious people do, but indulging in degradation is also the result of the release of innate nature.</p>
<p>Watching a fight is, after all, an interesting thing; dishonorable rumors are always "a hundred dogs barking"; the path to depravity is often one of no return.</p>
<p>Therefore, loving peace is not a characteristic unique to the Chinese nation, just as every nation has a "Jewish class" to some extent, and even every person's blood carries some "Jewish" blood!</p>
<p>However, people are always unwilling to "speak the truth" about facts. The "civilized person's" hypocrisy and the "gentleman's" pretense are the masterpieces of the world. When we read history, we always feel that the times of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, Cao Cao, and Wang Mang were too short. There has never been an officially commissioned History of the Qin Dynasty, History of the Wei Dynasty, History of the Xin Mang Dynasty... and so on. Therefore, Mencius' words, "It is better to have no book than to believe everything in a book," and Zeng Guofan's inscription on his tomb, "Do not believe in books, believe in luck, these words are for the world, a true statement," are positive articles. The scarcity and preciousness of positive articles are due to the fact that they are not readily discussed by the general public.</p>
<p>Why do European and American gentlemen sympathize with Jewish millionaires while ignoring the oppressed weak? Why did Mr. Romain Rolland ultimately advocate for peace, risking opposition? Why did democratic countries indifferently "sympathize" and "condemn" some time ago, and only now show an expression of "righteousness" and "anger"? This requires a "direct view"! At least, I think it can prove that there are no accidental events in the universe, because the "inevitability" of a thing is in accordance with the explanation of "human nature."</p>
<p>In the East, there are three types of saintly figures. One pretends not to eat pig's head meat, one does not dare to look directly at pig's cheek meat, and one admits that pig's head meat is for human consumption. However, these are three different expressions of human nature.</p>
<p>"Do not see what is desirable so that the heart is not confused." We do not need to say that this saintly attitude of "not looking directly" is too small and lacks heroic spirit, precisely because saints are not superhuman. It is said that one reason why some people dare not look at women is because looking at them makes their hearts beat faster; to avoid heart palpitations, they cannot help but put on a serious face, lower their heads, turn their necks, and tighten their steps. Mr. Shi Zhefu of Jiangyin said, "Those whose eyes do not look sideways, their intentions can be known!" This is truly a very pertinent saying. But my intention is not to judge the heart, but to encourage everyone to dare to speak the truth about facts.</p>
<p>Everyone admits that young people are progressive. They are passionate and dare to face life directly. But those who are content with old habits and laziness, or those who are old and unwilling to be revolutionary reformers, suddenly lower their heads, turn their heads, and tighten their steps to walk backward. Examples of this kind are not considered a rare thing.</p>
<p>Young people in their student days often consider themselves reformers and the backbone of the new society; but not many years later, they become typical new-style gentlemen. Traditional prejudiced reasons have long driven away their reformist ideas. Similarly, a lady with progressive ideas first regards herself as a new woman, but at the time of marriage, she immediately becomes a most vulgar modern young mistress, using her status as a decoration and appendage of a wealthy husband to take pride in, mocking her former companions. The slogan of the new women's era is perfect for finding a desirable husband. This is as natural as spitting for the Chinese. Therefore, experienced predecessors cannot help but smile at parents who think their offspring's ideas are too left-leaning, thinking they are simply overthinking!</p>
<p>The traitors in history were not just any nameless person at the time; they were definitely not paupers; they were definitely not people who did not understand the meaning of the words "Han" and "traitor"—even to the point of praising the greatness of the Han Dynasty, writing poems and paintings, and praising integrity, just like Zheng Xiaoxu, Zhu Keming, and Liang Hongzhi of modern times, and Huang Jun, who wrote "Flowers Follow the Holy Coffin: Gleanings" and played the "Old Traitor," were definitely not ordinary characters like Xiao Sanzi, Xiao Liuzi, Wang Wu, and Zhao Liu!</p>
<p>Who is more shameless? Who has achieved greater results as a traitor? Is it the wealthy or the pauper? Is it the prestigious and powerful or the nameless person? Is it the intellectual or the ignorant?</p>
<p>"Demons arise from people." A great era is truly a demon-revealing mirror. Why do people still not dare to face it directly?</p>
<h3>Living in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Ying Jun</p>
<p>Several young companions, abandoning their books, shouldered the banner of anti-Japanese education and ran to the suburbs of W City, where they lived for more than a month. The possible outcome is: either we will be aged by the old environment, or we will transform the dullness and make it youthful, so that we can stand up in this great era. We have confidence and are not lacking in enthusiasm. Perhaps we are all a little too naive, but this is not enough to be called an insurmountable obstacle in our work; we are about to be tempered by our work.</p>
<p>At first, the farmers widened their eyes and watched us enter their villages, living a life no different from theirs, carrying water every day, cooking meals, buying vegetables, and basking in the sun. We cast the anchor of our lives here, and life has fastened us here, and we will sow already salty seeds here, although work requires us to pick up this anchor from time to time and sail further away, letting others harvest here.</p>
<p>The farmers soon carried tables and stools, dragged their children, and mumbled the same set of words, saying how naughty the children were, and that it was hard work for the teachers to teach them. Obviously, this was an action they had consulted together. Our gentle attitude slightly dispelled their excessive respect for us. When they saw the children obediently listening to the teacher, forming circles, singing songs, and opening books to learn to count, their faces showed</p>
<h3>Inspire Your Courage to Move Forward</h3>
<p>— Li Wen</p>
<p>Why weep? Wipe away your tears. Inspire your courage and move forward! Can't you hear the motherland calling out loudly? Don't you know the motherland needs us, the youth? Don't be discouraged or fearful, inspire your courage and move forward! Respect ourselves, and deeply remember the shame. Fight to the very end for the rebirth of our motherland! Don't be decadent or dispirited, rouse your spirit! In the face of darkness, save our country, our home. Don't retreat, there's nothing to hold you back! Light is just ahead, only needing you to inspire your courage and move forward! A kind smile.</p>
<p>It is the slack season for farming; during the day, we only pound some grain and grind some flour to prepare for the New Year. However, these activities do not hinder us from drawing water and can still be considered a time for chatting. The distance between us and the farmers has been greatly reduced. Although after exchanging greetings, the young wives are still busy shyly offering stools and serving tea, and when we tread on the rice mortar and turn the windmill, the old grandmothers still force a smile and mutter, "Sin, sin," we can now talk freely. The trivial matters in the village and the harvest of the fields have all become topics of conversation. Besides these, in the conversations, we have given them a preliminary understanding of conscription, requisitions, and taxes; these orders are not just making them suffer. Gradually, they have developed a sense of the nation and the people, and they have begun to care about the progress of the war. During their spare time, the young wives and girls drag their female companions into their deep boudoirs to pour out their hearts and seek answers to many questions. They are surprised that we men and women live together, but they quickly understand that this era is very different from their grandmothers' era. They had been abandoned in the depths of hundreds of years, but now, in their hearts, the consciousness of anti-feudalism is growing. They have a friendship with their female companions that goes beyond sisterhood.</p>
<p>Every morning, a group of people and livestock habitually stand beside the white wall of the ancestral hall. Those who can read noisily read aloud, while those who are illiterate open their mouths wide to listen and look at the cartoons, and the livestock continue to graze at their feet. They always earnestly shout, "Teacher, stay a little longer and tell us more." Yes, the simplified wall posters are not enough; they need to know more. They have many questions and many opinions, and they often extend the debate to our small house to resolve their doubts. The people of the whole village are learning, with different degrees of progress: some have a concept of international relations, while others still ask why the cities on the map are so small, while the enemy's planes are so big. But they all recognize the enemy and are unwilling to succumb to a life of slavery.</p>
<p>The Lianbao Chief has appointed us as political instructors for militia training. Every morning, two of us have to climb over the mountain to give speeches and teach songs, and by the way, bring back the day's newspapers. This long stretch of road is rugged and muddy, but it relies on our efforts to shorten the distance between the Lianbao Chief and the villagers. This is our opportunity to adjust these relationships well. Later, the villagers even performed a three-day flower drum opera with the stationed military.</p>
<p>Every dusk, under the flickering oil lamp, a group of people gather, and the burning charcoal brazier heats their faces. Our small house is packed to saturation. Occasionally, wind and rain interrupt this customary evening gathering, and our house seems terribly large. The farmers are not aware that this is a collective discussion; they are just asking questions and looking for answers. But they can often find the central point of the questions raised on the wall posters, although sometimes they are innocently ridiculous, but how can they not contain an element of truth? Once, against a fatalist's argument for the weapon-only theory, they automatically concentrated their firepower to attack, and as a result, the speaker cried and asked us for help. In the face of pure truth, how despicable and shameful are those who intentionally or unintentionally put on a false facade!</p>
<p>However, on the third day of the New Year, after performing three days of opera, we announced that we were leaving C Village for more important work, even though the coarse rice and beans in the small house were not yet finished.</p>
<p>A group of people stood at the entrance of the village; futilely trying to persuade us to stay only added to the mood of disappointment. The children leaned against their parents silently, and the young wives secretly shed two lines of tears. "Come back often, teachers…" In this voice, the old donkey dragged our luggage and staggered out of the village.</p>
<p>The two rows of towering old trees at the entrance of C Village disappeared into the horizon, and we seemed to still hear, "You must come back, teachers…"</p>
<h3>Water Margin and National Revolution</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——Talking about National Novels</p>
<p>Water Margin has a very close relationship with the national revolution. To elaborate, there are the following five points:</p>
<p>First, is the late Ming Guan Shengyu's praise of the images of Liangshan characters. For example, when Li Song painted a portrait, Guan Shengyu would write a eulogy for the portrait. Guan Shengyu was a figure in the Ming Dynasty Cheng Minzheng's (Records of Ming Loyalists) records; his praise of the heroes of Water Margin shows how eagerly he hoped that grassroots heroes would rise up to restore the Song Dynasty and drive the Yuan people out of the Han territory.</p>
<p>Second, is that many of the Water Margin stories in the Yuan Dynasty Luo Guanzhong conform to historical facts. For example, Dong Ping was a bandit in Hunan. For example, Guan Sheng once resisted the Jin soldiers, as seen in the Zhu Shi and Jin Shi's Biography of Liu Yu. There was also Da Dao Wei Sheng who led the loyal army of Shandong in the thirty-first year of Shaoxing to fight against the Jin people, as seen in Song Shi Volume 368. As for Zhang Shun and Zhang Gui, they can be compared to Langli Baitiao Zhang Shun and Chuanhuo'er Zhang Heng. In one episode, Zhang Shun returned to the secret of Yongjin Gate. In Song Dynasty history, Zhang Shun did indeed die in the river, but it was the Yangtze River, not the Qiantang River, and the one he was attacking was the Yuan Dynasty's surrendered general Lu Wenhuan. For example, Wang Youzhi of Hebei is a shadow of Liangshan's Wang Si and Lin Lujunyi; both of them lived in Daming Prefecture; moreover, the loyal army led by Wang Youzhi was a very large force, counting tens of thousands of soldiers. Youzhi was also a commander on the imperial court's side, different from ordinary bandits, so Water Margin placed him in the second position to show respect. (The above arguments are quoted from Xie Xingyao's Research on Water Margin Characters in the first issue of Yi Jing) The situation is quite similar to the rise of guerrillas in various places now. Luo Guanzhong personally suffered under the rule of the Yuan Dynasty, and he probably had some feelings of hunger, right?</p>
<p>Third is the addition of the conquest of Liaoning in the version of Guo Xun's mansion during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. This is quite meaningful. At that time, the northern border had Anda repeatedly invading, and the southern border had Japanese pirates often harassing. The people in Guo Xun's mansion wanted to have heroes like those in Water Margin to defend the states, so they added the conquest of Liaoning to think of the ancients.</p>
<p>Fourth is Zhang Dai (Tao'an Mengyi) of the late Ming Dynasty wanting to save the decline of the Ming Dynasty. He praised the characters on Liangshan, saying that "the spirit of heroism, loyalty, and righteousness is accumulated in the brush and ink," which shows how much he yearned for those patriotic warriors and hoped that the late Ming Dynasty would also have such heroes to resist the Manchus.</p>
<p>Fifth is the use of Water Margin by the Heaven and Earth Society in the late Qing Dynasty. The Heaven and Earth Society means taking heaven as father and earth as mother, which comes from Water Margin's "pointing to heaven and earth as parents." The Xiamen team is one family, which coincides with Pearl Buck's later translation of Water Margin as "All Men Are Brothers." Therefore, there are two articles in the current Kangxi law prohibiting brotherhood. Later, the Heaven and Earth Society (i.e., the Triads or Red Turban) joined Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui, contributing a lot to the overthrow of the Manchus.</p>
<p>The above five points are the relationship between Water Margin and the national revolution. We should also read Water Margin now, and people from all over should rise up to fight in self-defense and guerrilla warfare.</p>

<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Suffered a Surprising Plunge Yesterday, a Wild Drop of More Than Six Yuan, Ultimately Settling Around Five Yuan Less. Rumors Circulated at Closing That Payments in Shanghai Could Be Made Via Remittance Drafts, Which Accords With This Newspaper's Claim on the 15th. External Debt Secured by Customs Duties Totals Approximately 30 Million Pounds, With Four Types Due for Interest Payment This Month, Including the Rehabilitation Loan.</h3>
<p>The securities grey market experienced an unexpected and bizarre shift yesterday after August 13th. Market prices plummeted, falling sharply. At the peak of the turmoil, prices were about five yuan lower than the previous weekend. Under normal circumstances, this would have resulted in an immediate halt to trading. But now, these are cash transactions, without limits on price fluctuations. After competition between buyers and sellers, prices rebounded slightly, rising about one yuan at noon. The cause of this intense and drastic change stems from a cable from Chongqing stating that the Ministry of Finance would no longer advance funds for various debt obligations secured by customs duties, due to the Japanese seizure of those funds. Last week, there were rumors of two possibilities: paying this period's interest in Chongqing or disbursing it in monthly installments. Just as people were feeling bewildered and anxious, this new measure, tantamount to suspension, understandably caused further panic in the market. It is speculated that the government's intention is for countries concerned about debts secured by customs revenue to deeply understand the dangers to their claims because of the Japanese seizure of both domestic and foreign debt funds, and to promptly realize the danger, cease indifference, and take effective and proper measures of restraint. From the government's perspective, this would more effectively maintain the legal tender. These are fine intentions and righteous measures, beyond reproach. Since domestic bonds are secured by customs revenue, and since foreign debt has been delayed for this reason, how could domestic debt be an exception? The fragile market sentiment has been dealt a heavy blow, and it is self-evident that sellers are competing to sell off as quickly as possible. However, the truth remains to be confirmed by an official cable from the government. At the closing bell, at 4:00 PM and 4:15 PM, news suddenly emerged from the Central Bank that payment of these interest coupons would be permitted via remittance drafts. This would avoid conflict with international debt obligations payable in legal tender, maintain creditworthiness as before, and cause no loss to bondholders. The government's concern for the interests of the people is demonstrated further. This also accords with what this newspaper argued previously (see the 15th), that it would be better to continue paying interest in Shanghai, but by remittance draft. This news reached the market late. Those who were first to sense the changing wind direction began to search for ways to buy back bonds, but were unable to obtain them. It is predicted that after the market opens today, there will be a significant and dramatic rebound. The lines of battle between buyers and sellers yesterday are quite thought-provoking. All the sellers were small investors, seeking only to unload their bonds regardless of price. All the buyers were large firms. In the morning, firms such as Xinfeng, Yongtong, Kang, and Tiansheng, with code numbers around "6," all took advantage of the situation to drive down prices and buy cheaply. Therefore, the rise and fall of the market often differed by one to two yuan. The lowest price was more than six yuan lower than the previous weekend. The severity of the turmoil was rare. But in the end, it was much ado about nothing. In the afternoon, small investors sold off in large quantities again, and the gains from the morning were immediately wiped out, even more so than before. Later, Xinfeng, Yong, and Tongkang, with code number "35," continued to absorb as much supply as possible, and the market price rose again by a few jiao. In the end, market prices closed down by 3.4 to 4.9 yuan. It is predicted that after the market rebounds today, it should stabilize. The result of the day's turmoil was entirely due to the foreign debt issue. All parties should remain calm and not act rashly. The total volume traded was approximately 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Among stocks, only shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at the stock exchange, with approximately 170 shares changing hands at a price of 5.725 yuan. As of January 1, 1939, the outstanding principal of foreign debt secured by customs duties and the Boxer Indemnity was 24,396,530 pounds and 25,536,500 US dollars. If converted to pounds, this would be more than 30 million pounds. This includes the Anglo-German Continuation Loan of 3,666,650 pounds, the Rehabilitation Loan of 19,691,880 pounds, the Sino-French US Dollar Bonds of 24,919,500 yuan, the Sino-Belgian US Dollar Bonds of 617,000 yuan, and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Bonds of 1,038,000 pounds. Except for the Anglo-German Continuation Loan, interest on the other four types of bonds is due on the 1st and 15th of this month. For foreign debt secured by salt taxes and other collateral, please refer to this newspaper's continuing series, starting today.</p>
<p>Yesterday's special economic column of this newspaper, which described the Anglo-Japanese handling of the Shanghai Customs, also noted the difficulty in continuing to pay foreign debt, which is the inevitable result of Britain's policy of appeasement. The weaker the British, the more assertive the Japanese. If, because of the Japanese assertiveness, even foreign admirers of realism reach the point of compromising and making concessions to not pay the principal and interest on the foreign debt in order to obtain small immediate benefits, and thus destroy the only remaining interests in the Far East, then there will inevitably come a day when it will be too late to regret. Only by using real strength to assist China and recover lost territory can foreign debt principal and interest be paid on schedule, and all foreign interests can continue to be enjoyed as usual.</p>
<p>In the past two years, many wealthy Chinese have sought to escape capital flight by buying back foreign debt. In particular, banks have also used foreign debt as a form of reserve asset. Once principal and interest payments are delayed, difficulties will inevitably be felt. But this is a means of destruction by the Japanese puppets. In any case, all parties should work together to overcome this difficulty, so that the Japanese destructive plans are not realized. Fortunately, no one is yielding to their coercion because of temporary pain, so that the Japanese can achieve their aims. If the result is that today's gains are small and the actual losses are great. Generally, Chinese bondholders have three different attitudes. One is frustration and great disappointment. One is that after foreign negotiation, the Japanese puppets would never brazenly disregard their obligations. One is that no matter what, final victory will ultimately belong to us, and that the non-payment is only temporary, and that in the future, both principal and interest will be fully recovered. Therefore, China can only strengthen its war of resistance efforts to achieve an early victory. Only in this way will the payment of principal and interest have a chance of success soon. If we bow our heads and beg for mercy, the result will ultimately be nothing. Only those with determination can regain their lost rights. Therefore, non-payment of foreign debt will of course have an impact on Chinese finance, but its effect is still slight. As for the loss of external credibility, the blame does not lie with us. The Chinese authorities must have a way to resolve it. London foreign debt market closed on Saturday, so there was no cable. Supply was tight, and prices were weak, with the possibility of continued decline. The kerchief market was affected by foreign exchange tightness and debt market panic, and absorbed supply. With so little available for sale, how could so much be absorbed? As a result, supply could not keep up, and market prices soared, breaking recent records, and the trend was strong. Foreign currency followed the weakness of foreign exchange and rose sharply due to the kerchief market surge. Over-the-counter trading was very active, and the trend was promising. Inter-guild trading was still strong. Yikang sold Changtai, buying 5,000 French franc notes. Xiangkang sold Changtai, buying 100 Singapore dollar notes. Changtai sold Sentai, buying 100 Singapore dollar notes. Qintai sold Sentai, buying 130 Singapore dollar notes. Chengtai sold Hongchang, buying 1,000 US dollar notes. Hongchang sold Xiangtai, buying 500 US dollar notes, and sold Xintai, buying 500 US dollar notes. Yesterday's market prices: the British gold pound rose 4 jiao, the British gold note rose 2.5 jiao, the US gold pound rose 4 jiao, the US gold note rose 3.5 li, the Hong Kong note rose 7 li, the French franc note rose 2 li, and the Singapore and Dutch notes each rose 5 fen. Canadian notes rose 1 fen, and Philippine notes rose 4 fen. Other minor currencies did not change because no trading took place.</p>
<h3>Finance: Customs Duty Interest Not Sufficient for Overdrafts, Drastic Changes in Gold, Selling Off Government Bonds to Buy Cash, Peak at 2,018 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash kerchief grey market situation, although British pure gold fell again, the local gold price moved towards a peak. Reports that the Ministry of Finance announced that payment of all bonds guaranteed by customs revenue would be temporarily suspended triggered a general desire among the wealthy to buy and hoard gold, and they sold off government bonds and switched to gold. In addition, foreign exchange was slightly weaker after being fiercely bought by various foreign firms, so buying interest was high. Although some gold shops and silver shops dumped, the supply was still insufficient, so the price broke through the 2,010 yuan mark, reaching a peak of 2,018 yuan. However, the money exchange industry and silver shops sold at high prices, causing the price to fall slightly at one point. Finally, it was difficult to maintain for long due to the lack of supply, and the price surged again by 17 yuan. The hearts of various groups were firm, but slightly unstable. Trading was quite active throughout the day. Silver shop jewelry gold also rose twice. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold fell again.</p>
<p>The kerchief Market Soared 17 Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Since morning, the initial prices (per bar of ten taels) caused general concern due to reports that the Ministry of Finance announced that payment of all bonds guaranteed by customs revenue would be temporarily suspended, so the general desire among wealthy individuals to buy gold was strong again, causing the price to open high. First, a money exchange industry entered 50 taels of gold at a gold shop, with an opening price of 2,003 yuan. Then, the securities group also entered 100 taels at a cash shop at a price of 04 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange industry came to buy gold again, entering 50 taels at a gold shop at a price of 07 yuan, and entering 50 taels at a silver shop at a price of 06 yuan. The price rose gradually as foreign exchange slightly weakened. Another money exchange industry entered 50 taels at a silver shop at a price of 07 yuan. A certain money exchange industry also came to buy, entering 100 taels at a fellow company at prices of 08 yuan and 09 yuan. After a certain silver shop absorbed supply, it immediately resold 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry at a price of 12 yuan. Later, it suddenly entered 50 taels at a money exchange industry at a price of 10 yuan. At the opportunity, another silver shop group entered 50 taels at a money exchange industry at prices of 08 yuan and 06 yuan. Finally, the money exchange industry entered 50 taels at a gold shop, with a closing price of 08 yuan at noon. Although foreign exchange was stable in the afternoon, the money exchange industry's intention to buy was even more urgent, and sellers were extremely scarce, so the upward trend was quite sharp. The opening price was raised to 2,011 yuan. Then, the money exchange industry made 50 taels amongst themselves. Later, the money exchange industry entered 90 taels at a silver shop group at a price of 14 yuan. Later, the money exchange industry entered 50 taels at a silver shop group at a price of 18 yuan, which was the highest price. At 3:40, the money exchange industry entered 50 taels at a gold shop, with a closing price of 2,017 yuan in the evening, an increase of 17 yuan compared to last Saturday. Thereafter, the appetite of buyers turned light, while sellers were active and gradually shouted down to 12 and 13 yuan, but no one entered (it was rumored that the money exchange industry was trading over the counter at 12 yuan for dozens of taels). In the end, a certain money exchange industry wanted to buy again, but those who entered were looking around, so they raised the price to 14 and 15 yuan, but no trading took place. The cash shop's own gold sold at a price of 2,025 yuan and bought back at 2,010 yuan. The current target gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Suspended at 205 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael was not changed. At 10:24 AM, when the kerchief market broke through the 2,010 yuan mark, it also rose by one yuan. Later, at 3:25 PM, the kerchief market rose to the border of 2,020 yuan, so it was raised another yuan. Da Tongxing changed the suspended price to 205 yuan, and Xin Tongxing suspended at 203 yuan, buying back at 197 yuan.</p>
<p>Central Pure Gold Down 1.1 Yuan</p>
<p>The Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold (kerchief) fell to 1,214.6 yuan. The listed customs gold also fell by 2 li, calculated at 2.401 yuan. The Shanghai standard target gold price also fell by 1.1 yuan, calculated at 1,209.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Soars</h3>
<p>Since last Saturday, British pure gold has fallen by half a point, and the British-American exchange rate has risen by 6,875. Because the Japanese detained customs duties and deposited them in Japanese banks, refusing to release them, in order to undermine China's currency policy and creditworthiness, the central government has adopted a strict stance and will no longer tolerate it. It has refused the Customs Service to continue overdrafts from the Central Bank to pay debt interest, causing public agitation and driving purchases of foreign exchange. Foreign firms are closing their accounts.</p>
<h3>No Impact on the Foreign Exchange Fund, Although Foreign Firms Are Still Closing Their Accounts, the Resulting Tightness Is Very Slight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the foreign exchange market received news of the Chinese Ministry of Finance's announcement that customs duties in war zones had been seized, and that various debts guaranteed by customs revenue would be divided according to the revenue from each customs house and would no longer be overdrafted, this adjustment to financial steps had no impact on the foreign exchange fund. Not allowing overdrafts can save a large outflow of foreign exchange. Moreover, the previous overdraft amount was not very large. As for the principal and interest of domestic debt, they will still be paid as usual, so there is no impact on foreign exchange matters. Therefore, although foreign firms were closing their accounts busily yesterday and the supply from banks was not smooth, the resulting tightness was very slight. In the middle of the day, there was foreign cable traffic from Hong Kong, so the situation tended to be stable, without excessive fluctuations. Trading was quite active.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's near and far cables were long, but New York spot prices did not change. London's raw gold shrank by half a point, and the exchange rate between Britain and the United States rose by 3 li and 7 sheng, and between Britain and France by 13 centimes. There was no change with Shanghai. The US dollar rose against the British dollar by 6,875, and against the French dollar by 625. There was no change with Shanghai. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained stable as before. The silver balance tax was announced to be 1.5 fen higher. Thereafter, because foreign firms were closing their accounts frequently, and because banks were not providing a smooth supply, and also because there were rumors that government bonds had plummeted, the situation gradually became firmer and softer. US dollars only closed at 16.25 yuan, British dollars at 8.34375 jiao, and Hong Kong dollars only closed at 55.875 yuan. Banks absorbed supply above 56 yuan, and then returned slightly to 56.125 yuan. There was no change after that. Close to noon, only trading in Hong Kong dollars opened. Although money exchange industries were selling, foreign firms were buying, and banks were also making profitable trades, so the process was still smooth. The noon closing price for British dollars was 8.34375 jiao, and for US dollars it was 16.25 yuan.</p>
<p>In the later market, although foreign firms were still closing accounts busily, banks were still selling, resulting in a lack of change. Finally, the intention of foreign cable traffic to supply emerged again, and speculators also followed the trend and sold off. Also, the banks' appetite for absorption was not good, so the situation seemed to be slightly looser. By the late closing, the banks' selling price for British dollars was 8.34375 jiao and for US dollars it was 16.25 yuan. As a result, British dollars shrank by 0.03125 yuan, and US dollars tightened by 0.0625 yuan compared to last Saturday, and Hong Kong dollars tightened by 0.25 yuan. The trading market that opened yesterday was omitted due to space constraints.</p>
<h3>Hoarding Cash</h3>
<p>Since the government bond interest payment issue occurred, the discount rate has rebounded, as expected. Yesterday, the discount rate for remittance drafts and cash drafts changed greatly. The need for cash is increasing every day. Those who have it are hoarding it. Initially, every 1,000 yuan was still hovering around 35 yuan, but soon it rose to 37.25 yuan, 36.75 yuan at noon, and continued to fall slightly in the afternoon. Finally, it was 36.25 yuan, which was 1.5 yuan higher than last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Black Fungus After Soaring Prices, All Shops Are Considering Selling</h3>
<p>Black fungus soared in price last week because the warehouses had run out and were eager to buy. But once the market price was high, all the shops holding stock considered selling, so the market situation suddenly turned soft. According to yesterday's market conditions, the opening price in the future should be at least 7 or 8 yuan lower, because the vendors were unable to raise their sales prices too much.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Factory's Raw Materials Shift to Imported Cotton: The Golden Age of Local Cotton is Over</h3>
<p>Imported cotton market prices: New York turned positive due to the rebound in securities, and cloth sales remained good. However, due to the debate in Washington regarding agricultural legislation, no resolution has been heard, leading to public unease. There is a shortage of spot goods in the market, and the market is exceptionally tight. According to statistical reports, U.S. domestic cotton consumption in December was 565,307 bales, an increase of 132,979 bales compared to 432,328 bales in the same period last year. Yesterday, spot traders and exporters were the main buyers in the market, resulting in a rise of 10 points per pound for near-term contracts and 8-9 points per pound for deferred contracts. Indian cotton, including speculative trading, rose by more than one rupee, while Egyptian cotton fell by 2-3 points per pound. Yesterday's exchange rate slightly decreased, but when converted to legal tender, cotton prices all rose. American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 1.15 yuan per picul, Indian cotton rose by 0.7 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by 1.4 yuan.</p>
<p>In the local imported cotton trade, China Textile Industries and Shen Hsin again ordered 3,000 bales of Indian cotton from Shengheng Foreign Firm, including 1,000 bales of American upland cotton at a factory price of 88 yuan, and 2,000 bales of extra-grade Omra cotton at a delivered factory price of 72.5 yuan. Hongzhang also purchased 300 bales of Indian cotton en route. Japanese factories remain the main consumers of imported cotton, as local cotton inventory is very low and nearing depletion. If arrangements are not made promptly, there may be a shortage in the future. The transaction volume of yesterday is listed below:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Transaction Volume</p>
<p>Shen Hsin imported 3,000 bales of Indian cotton</p>
<p>Hongzhang imported 300 bales of Indian cotton</p>
<p>Yufeng imported 500 bales of Indian cotton</p>
<p>Yufeng imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton</p>
<p>Gongda imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton</p>
<p>Tongxing imported 500 bales of Indian cotton</p>
<p>Tongxing imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton</p>
<p>The local cotton business has turned quiet. Factories, due to the slump in the yarn market and sales not as smooth as before, are unwilling to purchase high-priced raw cotton, leading to stagnant trading and weak market prices. Japanese factories have received a large influx of Indian cotton orders, sufficient for their needs, and currently have no need to purchase local cotton. Therefore, the market is scattered, with only slight activity among peers to fulfill factory quotas, and very little new development. The cotton market is in a state of suspended animation. The source from northern Jiangsu is considerable, with 3,581 bales of ginned cotton arriving in the past two days, 900 pieces arriving from Niantuo Port, and 370 pieces arriving from Beisha. Fifty pieces were exported to Shantou today. The current cotton situation and market conditions are listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Shaken by Debt Interest: Floating Sellers Pour Out Like Water, Prices Fall by 5-6 Yuan Each</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, with the downward trend particularly severe. Market rumors suggest that the payment of public debt interest will be moved to Chongqing, leading the public to believe that capital will tighten, with various unfavorable narratives. Floating sellers are cutting their losses, coming one after another, causing the market to plummet. Buyers, sensing that the environment has been good for a long time, are also hesitant to advance, making the trend even more sluggish. When the spot yarn market opened yesterday morning, 20-count Double Horse was at a small 5-cent premium, with the Jiangxi group trading 10 bales. Before long, a selling spree began, claiming that Quanzhou port was automatically closed, Shanghai-Quanzhou flights were suspended, and the air war in Chongqing was fierce, causing public anxiety. Prices were shouted out like water pouring downhill. Double Horse plunged straight to 379 yuan. However, the trading volume among peers was still large, with 445 bales traded. By closing, it was reported that the Yunnan group still had over 200 bales of actual sales. When prices were low, some people came to buy in, and Double Horse rebounded by 2.5 yuan, closing at 381.5 yuan. It was found that 909 bales were traded in the morning, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 5.5 yuan compared to the previous day, Double Globe fell by 4.5 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell by 7 yuan, Special Jincheng fell by 4 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn fell by 5-6 yuan. Factories have not taken any action. 650 pieces were exported to Shantou, 65 pieces to Hong Kong, 35 pieces to Haikou, 75 pieces to Beihai, and 490 pieces to Haiphong. The purchase volume of each group is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Peers 615, Jiangxi 24, Shantou 20, Inland 30, Yunnan 200, Wenzhou 15, Ningbo 5, Total 909</p>
<p>The demand for Japanese yarn is sluggish, public sentiment is scattered, and selling prices have fallen by another 2 yuan. Coupled with the decline in Chinese yarn, Japanese yarn has no spirit to recover. The current price of 20-count Blue Phoenix spot yarn is 302.5 yuan, with 302.5 to 304.5 yuan for this month's delivery. 20-count Water Moon yarn is 309 yuan, with 305.5 to 307 yuan for this month's delivery, it is said.</p>
<h3>Food: Flour and Wheat Firm</h3>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The flour market trend was firm yesterday, with local merchant transactions still not weak. However, Tianjin merchant transactions are still difficult to develop, mainly due to the low Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate and the dumping of foreign flour in the local area. Sales to the north rely only on small-scale operations in Qinhuangdao, Yantai, and Weihai. Southern merchants still inquire from places like Fuzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen. Reports of the closure of Quanzhou port are yet to be confirmed. The total number of transactions yesterday was still around 30,000 bags. Goods of all brands are still following the original price of 4.9 yuan. Yesterday, 22,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin, and 7,250 bags of flour and 1,000 bags of bran were shipped to Shantou.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>In the past two days, the source of wheat totaled more than 10,000 bags. Some of the newly arrived wheat from Wuhu, northern Jiangsu, etc. was damp, and because it was soft and could not be stored for long, the sellers were quite accommodating. The dry wheat, however, remained as expensive as ever. Because the factories had not received their previously ordered foreign wheat, the need for domestic wheat was justifiable, resulting in 15,000 bags being traded at the original price, with Fuhsin purchasing 10,000 bags and Fu Feng purchasing 5,000 bags. The highest price was still 6.7 yuan. The selling prices of medium-quality goods and damp wheat varied slightly. It is said that a ship of foreign wheat jointly ordered by Fuhsin and Fufeng will arrive at the beginning of next week. Yesterday, 1,400 bags of wheat arrived from Xingang.</p>
<h3>The Future of People's Food is Highly Worrying: Japanese Massively Scouring for Rice; Preparing to Handle Another 200,000 Bags in Changshu, Wuxi, and Other Places; Total Amount of Indica and Japonica Rice Handled Before and After Reaches 700,000 Bags, Causing Panic Among Stockpilers; Many Original Bags Loaded onto Warehouses</h3>
<p>Japonica Rice</p>
<p>The source is still limited, with only five boats of Hexia goods arriving, totaling more than 4,000 bags of Chelin Baozi. It is said that after Japanese merchants massively scoured for more than 100,000 bags in Changshu, Wuxi, Hupu, Baimao, and other places earlier, they will scour for another 200,000 bags before the end of this lunar year. They are also scouring for more than 100,000 bags of thin rice from Songjiang, Sijing, and other places. In total, the Japanese merchants have recently handled 700,000 bags of various indica and japonica rice, including those shipped from Wuhu and exported. People are uneasy, thinking that if this is true, the source of rice in Shanghai will be greatly affected. As a result, many large stockpilers are loading their original bags onto warehouses. At the same time, local merchants are also following suit. Sellers are taking advantage of the opportunity to raise prices, and the evening market became lively. As a result, the price of thick glutinous rice continued to rise by a few cents to 1 dime. The route for thin rice was slightly inferior, only improving by 3-5 cents. Yangjian goods were scarce, increasing by another 1 dime. Dudu glutinous rice was slightly higher by a few cents. Because Yin Yuan lacked a large source and the seasonal demand was increasingly frequent, small stockpilers were searching for goods everywhere, causing the price to rise sharply by 2 dimes. Yin Yuan is still out of stock and without a market.</p>
<p>Indica Rice</p>
<p>Although the arrival of rice tails continued, the shortage and sharp rise of Bengjian rice in Hexia has attracted the attention of various local merchants. There are fewer rice tails of Nanjing Gao indica, and the owners are quite speculative. There is a lot of Wuhu rice in stock. It was rumored that a small amount of Jiangxi rice had been shipped in, but all of it was sold as Chongjing and Wuhu indica. Therefore, there has been no official transaction of Jiangxi rice in the market so far. Transactions were brisk yesterday, with around 2,000 bags traded. Most of the sellers were offering high-quality Wuhu indica at 10.05-0.06 yuan, while special Chongbu indica was priced at 11 yuan, an increase of 1-1.5 dimes compared to the end of last week.</p>
<h3>Import and Export: Fortune Oranges Flowing In</h3>
<p>Xiamen honey oranges are flowing in steadily, with another 1,770 barrels arriving yesterday, as well as 2,500 pieces of kiln goods.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Brown Sugar High, Scant Inventory to Blame</h3>
<p>Domestic brown sugar is currently in high demand and selling briskly. As the release of goods has been targeted to the smaller stock counts of Chaozhou brown sugar, asking prices are inevitably raised, with the market showing signs of excessive price inflation. A proper market price will be evident only when new Chaozhou brown sugar arrives in full force. The foreign sugar association’s prices had minor ups and downs. Dutch No. 24 coarse white was priced at 24.65 yuan for stock on the wharf, and 24.5 yuan for off-wharf stock. Transshipment goods were priced at 16.4 yuan. Dutch red sugar and Taikoo car sugar both remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 100 bags of sugar arrived from Beihai, 200 bags from Hong Kong, 590 bags from Shantou, and another 100 bags from Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Rising Daily; White Filature Silk Asking Price Reaches 1,350 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the price increase reported in Yokohama last week, overseas silk prices have been rising daily. Local market conditions, coupled with soaring raw material costs and other factors, have made prices more firm and high. Yesterday, Yokohama spot prices rose 5 yuan, opening at 865 yuan; forward prices rose 6 yuan, opening at 856 yuan. The silk market sentiment is hoping to break the 900 yuan mark. Therefore, the asking price for 7-8 grade white filature silk in the local market has jumped to 1,350 yuan. However, this is still more than 30 yuan away from the purchasing price of foreign firms, so no transactions have been heard of. Silk sales in Lyon have been rising rapidly recently. The asking price for non-uniform white filature silk RR, 20-22 denier, opened at 1,300 yuan yesterday, a huge increase of 50 yuan compared to two weeks ago. Yesterday, Xinfu and other firms imported a total of 40 bales. Transactions in Indian non-filature silk were quite quiet yesterday, with no activity all day. White tussah silk prices are very weak. Conversely, the demand for inland silk fabrics has been quite strong. Therefore, more than 10 bales were shipped to Wenzhou yesterday for transshipment to the inland.</p>
<p>The previous day (the 15th), 166 boxes of rayon were imported, coming from Italy.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Re-packaged Eastern Cloth Operating Secretly; Transactions in Domestic Cloth Lacking Wholesale</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>The asking prices for coarse cloth and twill remain unchanged this week. Factory prices for fine cloth and fine twill are very high. However, the sales prices of goods held by peers continue to decline, as transactions with customers are slightly less frequent. The fine cloth of the Dapeng, Fugui, Sipinglian, Renzhong, and Feihong brands all fell by about 1 dime, and twill also fell by 5-10 cents. The reason for this is that after Zhejiang and Jiangxi made huge purchases of Japanese goods last week, they lacked wholesale appetites. In addition, after the market prices were raised excessively, it facilitated the sale of colored cloth and the re-packaged Eastern cloth secretly resumed large-scale operations. Therefore, the transactions in white goods by customers are bleak and lifeless, with only Shantou bringing about 50 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Transactions in other places are sporadic. The customer sales of coarse cloth from Yihua and other factories are sluggish, but factory prices are very firm. The new transactions in colored cloth are more active in Funing, northern Jiangsu, with about 2,000 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, kersey, and serge being traded. About 1,500 pieces are also being handled in Wuxi and Changzhou. The retail purchases of Raozhou, Jinhua, Nanchang and other ports along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are still not lonely. The Oujiang and Ningbo merchants shipped out more than 200 boxes, with very few additions. Customers from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Singapore are more interested in light-colored cloth, with about 1,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, white-ground printed cloth, and satin being traded.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The morning market opened with prices of fine cloth and fine twill shouted higher (per piece) by about 5 cents, but then fell back. The market rallied slightly in the afternoon, but in the end, there was not much difference from the sales prices on Saturday of last week. 12-pound Colorful Ball and Yanghe fine cloth were both priced at 11.25 yuan, Dragon Head at 11.225 yuan, and Dragon Head fine twill at 10.09 yuan. Tianjin merchants imported more than 500 packages of fine cloth and fine twill of various brands. Local dye-ready goods business and retail wholesale also purchased about 500-600 pieces. The market is still considered firm and stable.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>Today, 440 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Shantou, 30 pieces to Hong Kong, 55 pieces to Haikou, and 90 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>The Impact of Debt Interest Issues on the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the various markets in Shanghai were affected by the debt interest issue: the exchange rate of drafts and the discount rate of bills increased by 1.5 yuan, the settlement business of cotton yarn suddenly increased, and selling prices fell by 5, 6, and 7 yuan each. Raw silk moved towards a high peak, soaring by 17 yuan. Foreign firms increased their remittance settlements, scrambling to buy in. Even British and American gold tickets and gold pounds rose sharply. This shows the public's panic, which is actually unnecessary.</p>

<p>Opinions on Improving Today's Pharmaceutical Education ... Gai Bo</p>
<p>Idle Talk about Vaccination ... Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>B. The Situation of B.C.G. Vaccination in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Commentary: Opinions on Improving Today's Pharmaceutical Education</h3>
<p>— Gai Bo</p>
<p>The sound of a cannon in Lugou Bridge awakened the entire China from its sleep. We are striding towards the road of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction." A few days ago, the *Shen Bao* reported that the Ministry of Education intended to establish guidelines for wartime education and sought opinions from all parties. This precisely demonstrates the revolutionary Ministry of Education's forward-looking intention. I, being untalented, am writing down what I have seen, felt, and hoped for in pharmaceutical education, as a suggestion to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>China's pharmaceutical education only has a few years of history. During these few years, it has been neglected by many, who thought that pharmacy was merely an accessory to medicine and did not have a position worthy of attention. Since the outbreak of the war, pharmacy has been gradually valued because its need has increased sharply with the sudden increase in wounded soldiers and refugees, and the supplies, which originally relied on foreign sources, have instead sharply reduced their import volume. We have seen many refugees, in every bombing, pressing their wounds and shouting all day long, yet there were no painkillers to reduce their suffering. We have seen many brave soldiers, due to the lack of disinfectants, unnecessarily losing their lives due to small wounds while being injured for the sake of their country. We have seen a team of soldiers trembling in the battlefield due to the prevalence of malaria. Although enthusiastic doctors are willing to remove the chains of this disease for them, they are powerless due to the lack of quinine... These are all tragic events! The erroneous valuation of pharmacy in the past has now been exposed.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the situation in Shanghai is still the same as before the war. Their curricula have not increased due to the needs of the war. Many mediocre professors still think that the only task of pharmacy students is to be pharmacists in a pharmacy, focusing on testing whether the medicines bought from abroad meet the specified content, as if pharmacy students are merely salesmen of foreign goods. This kind of colonial education error has long been exposed. But the pharmaceutical education in Shanghai has been wrong all along and has not been corrected.</p>
<p>The bell of the great era has already rung. Everything is moving along the road of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction." Undoubtedly, pharmaceutical education, which is of great importance, cannot be allowed to continue to be wrong. It must also follow this path. It needs the education of an independent country, producing as much of its own needed medicines as possible, to save many wounded soldiers and refugees and strengthen the effectiveness of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Although the lack of medicines is now greatly felt to be inconvenient and painful, and medicines are still able to be imported in small amounts because international shipping has not been cut off, opening our eyes and looking at the world situation, everyone is alarmed by the storm clouds in Europe, which may turn into a tempest one day. At that time, shipping will stop and the source of medicines will be completely cut off. If China is still like this in the future, none of us dare to imagine what a terrible and dead country China will become! Wise Ministry of Education, it is time to accelerate the cultivation of practical pharmaceutical talents.</p>
<p>Since current pharmaceutical education should follow the path of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction," then the attention of educators should shift from specializing in testing to specializing in manufacturing. What China urgently needs to do during the war is nothing more than two things: one is to imitate existing foreign medicines and manufacture them ourselves, and the other is to be able to use Chinese medicines as much as possible—a great legacy.</p>
<p>In order to manufacture medicines ourselves, attention should of course be paid to pharmaceutical manufacturing chemistry. Medicines are divided into organic and inorganic categories. Because the education of inorganic chemistry knowledge takes more time, students have a clearer concept in their minds. Generally speaking, the manufacture of inorganic medicines is much easier. As for organic chemistry knowledge, the pharmacy schools in Shanghai only have one and a half or two years of courses, and it is only general organic chemistry. Regarding organic analysis, although there are some scattered things in the organic part of pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmacy students should have systematic and complete organic analysis knowledge, and these scattered things are really useless. Organic synthesis is the most urgently needed at the current stage, but there is still no course setting for this in the pharmacy schools in Shanghai. Because current medicines are gradually trending towards the organic aspect, students are still looking forward to more advanced knowledge than organic chemistry.</p>
<p>As for the utilization of Chinese medicine, that is the knowledge of pharmacognosy. Everyone knows that this is a large pile of legacy left by many pharmacognosists since Shennong. There are both essential and worthless things in this legacy. Due to the lack of scientific knowledge of the predecessors, there has never been a systematic sorting work. So-called Chinese medicine is like a pile of disordered grass, difficult to sort out. And the students who take on this responsibility are at the forefront. Unfortunately, before the war, the sorting work of Chinese medicine suffered the same fate as the entire pharmacy, encountering neglect. When one counts the many people in North China, Southeast China, etc., who are concentrated in the provinces that famously produce Chinese medicine, such as Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, and sees so many people suffering unnecessarily due to the lack of medicines or even sacrificing their lives, while the whole pile of domestic herbal medicines cannot be used well, this is such an unreasonable, terrible, and contradictory situation. The students who bear the great responsibility of eliminating this contradiction also belong to pharmacy students. Looking at the pharmacy schools in Shanghai, the pharmacognosy they study is all foreign pharmacognosy. They have studied coca leaves, santonin flower medicine, watermelon, and coriander seeds, but they do not know *Angelica sinensis*, *Alisma plantago-aquatica*, *Platycodon grandiflorus*, *Adenophora stricta*, *Peucedanum praeruptorum*, and *Fritillaria cirrhosa*. They know foreign *Stephania tetrandra* and *Polygala tenuifolia*, but they do not know domestic *Stephania tetrandra* and *Polygala tenuifolia*. They do not even know whether the parts they use belong to the root, stem, flower, fruit, or seed. After pharmacy students trained in this way graduate, I ask, can they bear this burden? Therefore, in addition to pharmacognosy (specifically covering foreign herbal medicines), there must also be knowledge of Chinese medicine. Although this knowledge is still in its infancy, it is at least possible to make pharmacy students know whether the medicinal part of *Angelica sinensis* is the root or the stem.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, let us temporarily not use Chinese medicine. Then this knowledge of pharmacognosy is still not enough, because what is said in pharmacognosy is only the recognition of the morphology and structure and components of a herbal medicine, but it does not tell you how this herbal medicine is generated. It can give you the ability not to buy counterfeit products, but it cannot devise ways to transplant foreign goods to China, so that the same medicinal materials grow on Chinese territory. This is still just a salesperson of foreign goods, and there is still a risk of being cut off from medicines because we cannot be self-sufficient. Therefore, we also need to add "horticulture of medicinal materials."</p>
<p>In addition to the four courses mentioned above, which need to be added to adapt to the goal of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction," in order to increase efficiency, students and the school should also supervise each other to accelerate progress.</p>
<p>In the past, schools inviting professors could be said to worship the doctrine of doctors. If someone returned from abroad and had spent a few years living a bread-winning life, although they were mediocre and their knowledge was not enough to be competent as a professor, it seemed unimportant. However, the professor's title of doctor attracted the attention of the school very much. A professor like this only wastes students' time and money, blocks students' knowledge of this subject, and makes students feel bored with this subject.</p>
<p>A school is a large group. Students join this group to cultivate their wisdom. Professors in this group are people who guide students and enlighten students' wisdom. Students have the right to ask questions, and professors have the obligation to enlighten them. If this professor's own wisdom is not enough to guide students and enlighten students, but instead blocks students' enthusiasm for knowledge, then for the sake of students' own wisdom and the educational authorities' purpose of running the school, why do students not have the right to impeach these people who occupy positions without doing any real work? A professor who is half-baked can never give his students intellectual satisfaction.</p>
<p>Chinese youths have awakened. The prison of scores can no longer confine them. They have recognized justice. The wise authorities should know the new trend of young students and should no longer excessively misjudge their psychology with the concept of scores.</p>
<p>Students should have the right to impeach professors who occupy positions without doing any real work because the professor's talent directly affects the student's future. They do not demand that every professor be as erudite as Pasteur, Ehrlich, or Faraday. But at the very least, they should understand what they are teaching. If they cannot even be competent for these basic responsibilities, then they do not have the talent to guide and enlighten students' wisdom. I hope the educational authorities can authorize students to impeach these mediocre professors, so as not to waste students' time and money, block their wisdom, and cause unnecessary boredom, reducing the efficiency of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction."</p>
<p>In summary, I hope that after a pharmacy student graduates, they can stand on their own position and be competent for the task of "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction," without learning something that is not used. Although this is a personal hope, I am sure it is also the urgent expectation of many pharmacy students. I hope the wise Ministry of Education will give it deep consideration.</p>
<p>Popular Medical Talks</p>
<h3>Smallpox Vaccination Chat</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunchou</p>
<p>The purpose of this publication is originally to guide the public on basic knowledge of health from a scientific standpoint, and to correct the public's misconceptions about medicine. Recently, smallpox has been prevalent, and vaccination has become a widely known fact. There is no need to discuss "Smallpox Vaccination Chat" again. However, in fact, there are still various inconsistencies in the public's perception and techniques regarding vaccination. Therefore, I am using this column to inform readers.</p>
<p>(1) Is Vaccination Inoculating Poison? Vaccination to prevent smallpox is already well known to the general public. However, there are still some people who mistakenly believe that vaccination is "extracting poison," that is, after vaccination, the poison inside the body can be extracted, and from then on, the occurrence of smallpox can be avoided. This is indeed a misconception. The occurrence of smallpox is caused by the transmission of smallpox pathogens, not poison inherited by the infant from the mother, nor poison produced by the infant itself that can be excreted through vaccination.</p>
<p>(2) How Can Vaccination Prevent Smallpox? This is called automatic immunity in medicine. Originally, when a certain foreign object invades the human body, a kind of antitoxin will be produced in the blood. For example, when substance A invades, an antitoxin for substance A will be produced. After being vaccinated with cowpox, an antitoxin against smallpox will be produced. When unfortunately infected with smallpox pathogens, the blood contains an antitoxin against smallpox, which can avoid the occurrence of smallpox. The cholera prevention injection in summer has the same meaning. Also, if you are vaccinated quickly after contact with a smallpox patient, it is still effective because the vaccination will take effect within seven days, and the incubation period of smallpox is ten to thirteen days.</p>
<p>(3) Why Do You Need to Be Vaccinated Multiple Times? The duration of the antitoxin mentioned above in the body is uncertain. Some last very long, some very short. The defense of vaccination lasts up to ten years. If the antitoxin disappears early, smallpox can still occur even after vaccination. Therefore, the law stipulates that newborns should be vaccinated for the first time within six months of birth, and vaccinated for the second time at the age of ten. However, when smallpox is prevalent, those who have been vaccinated for five years, or when the vaccination does not take effect (that is, insensitive or non-sensitive), should be vaccinated again.</p>
<p>(4) Should People Who Have Had Variolation and the Elderly Be Vaccinated? We know from the facts that after having true smallpox once, it is rare to be infected with smallpox again. The so-called variolation is an old method from ancient India and our country, which is to artificially inoculate the scabs of smallpox into the nasal cavity of healthy people, causing symptoms similar to smallpox, but the symptoms are milder than true smallpox. However, how much immunity it has and whether it is longer than vaccination with cowpox, we dare not assert. But in fact, people who have had variolation can still be infected with smallpox. Therefore, people who have had variolation should still not be careless and should be vaccinated again. According to the unreliability of variolation mentioned above and the possibility of the disappearance of antitoxins, the elderly should also be vaccinated again during the period when smallpox is prevalent for safety.</p>
<p>(5) Variolation Should Be Strictly Prohibited. The quality of cowpox vaccine can be controlled by management methods. For example, whether the cow is healthy and whether the disinfection during manufacturing is complete. However, variolation is the practice of ignorant doctors preserving and applying smallpox scabs. Not only are the symptoms more dangerous than cowpox when it occurs, but it can also transmit other viruses. If the scabs they preserve come from children with viruses, such as the transmission of syphilis, the medical records are undoubtedly true. Therefore, in remote areas, because cowpox vaccine is not available, or people who are stubborn and superstitious believe that variolation is better than cowpox, and use outdated and dangerous methods, shouldn't this be strictly prohibited?</p>

<h3>Medical News: The Situation of BCG Vaccination in Shanghai</h3>
<p>It is well known that B.C.G. has the effect of preventing tuberculosis. Now, the Pasteur Institute in Shanghai has been engaged in manufacturing it. Since March of the 26th year of the Republic of China, infant vaccinations have been carried out in the obstetrics department of Guangci Hospital. As of October of last year, a total of 800 infants have been vaccinated. The method of vaccination is very simple. Half an hour before breastfeeding in the morning on the third, fifth, and seventh day after the infant is born, mix the total amount of bacteria contained in an ampoule with warm milk and let the infant drink it. After the infant takes it, there is no local or systemic reaction, and there is no any impact on the digestive system. Physicians in this city who need B.C.G. vaccine can directly contact the Pasteur Institute on Jin Shenfu Road. The institute can provide it free of charge, but this vaccine is a live vaccine and cannot be stored for a long time. It cannot be used after eight days, otherwise the vaccination will be ineffective. This should be noted.</p>

<h3>Unified Government Bonds Due at the End of the Month Will Be Paid in Chongqing Instead; Shanghai Will Pay in Six Installments Over One Month; Customs Guarantee That Debts Will Not Be Overdrawn; Stock Market Transactions Plunged Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued a notice that customs-guaranteed bonds will no longer be allowed to be overdrawn, the price of unified government bonds on the informal securities trading market in Shanghai has plummeted. As for the principal and interest of the unified government bonds due at the end of this month, totaling 51,128,300 yuan, it has been decided that the Central Bank will pay as usual, but the payment will be made by the Chongqing head office. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>No Overdrafts Allowed</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a notice that for all customs-guaranteed bonds borrowed before the war that have not been repaid, the amount that should be allocated proportionally from the customs revenue outside the war zone should be transferred to the Central Bank for special deposit on a regular basis. However, this allocation method is only a temporary measure to cope with the current extraordinary situation. If the customs in the war zone later deliver the outstanding and unpaid indemnity and the allocated amount of subsequent tax revenue to the General Administration of Customs as before, the bond fund should still be allocated as before at the same time to restore the pre-war situation. In order to maintain domestic and foreign credit and protect the interests of bondholders, the Central Bank has advanced overdrafts of 175 million yuan. No further overdrafts will be allowed in the future. It is reported that banks, money shops, and bondholders generally consider the Ministry of Finance's handling method to be appropriate. Regarding the repayment of principal and interest of the unified government bonds due at the end of January, because the lottery has already been drawn, it has been decided to repay on schedule and not adopt the method of proportional allocation of customs revenue.</p>
<p>Customs-Guaranteed Bonds</p>
<p>Domestic and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties. As of the end of June 1937 for foreign debts: the 1898 Anglo-German loan of £4,308,025, the 1913 Reorganization Loan of £20,178,860, and the Wheat and Cotton Loan of US$14,700,000. As of the end of the 27th year of the Republic of China for domestic debts: the total issuance of the Unified Government Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China was 146 million yuan, with debts of 143,850,000 yuan for Type A, 146,250,000 yuan for Type B, 341,250,000 yuan for Type C, 536,250,000 yuan for Type D, and 253,500 yuan for Type E, totaling 1,421,100,000 yuan. The issuance of the Rehabilitation Government Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China was 34 million yuan, with debts of 33,750,000 yuan. The issuance of the Long-Term Financial Government Bonds of the 17th year of the Republic of China was 45 million yuan, with debts of 33,150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Stock Market Plunges</p>
<p>The informal securities trading market on the seventh floor of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only allows spot transactions. Originally, there were two trading sessions at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm. Yesterday, the trading of unified government bonds on this market experienced a price drop in all five types (A, B, C, D, and E) due to the Ministry of Finance's statement that customs-guaranteed bonds would not be allowed to be overdrawn. The following is a comparison of the market prices last Saturday and yesterday: Type A: (Last) 62.3 yuan, (Yesterday) 56.5 yuan; Type B: (Last) 54.7 yuan, (Yesterday) 50 yuan; Type C: (Last) 53.1 yuan, (Yesterday) 49 yuan; Type D: (Last) 52 yuan, (Yesterday) 48.5 yuan; Type E: (Last) 52.25 yuan, (Yesterday) 48.6 yuan. However, the spot transactions yesterday decreased significantly compared to before.</p>
<p>Shanghai Pays in Installments</p>
<p>According to reliable information obtained from financial circles, the unified government bonds of types A, B, C, D, and E, including the drawn bonds and six interest payments, will be paid as usual on the 31st of this month. However, it has been decided to change the payment to be made by the head office of the Central Bank in Chongqing, and there will be no installments. The full amount will be received after deducting only the interest income tax. However, the exchange rate between Chongqing and Shanghai requires a premium of 150 yuan per thousand yuan. The three branches of the Central Bank in Shanghai can collect the payment on behalf of the bondholders. Those who wish to collect the payment from the three branches of the Central Bank in Shanghai will receive it in six installments, with each installment being one month. As for the detailed methods of payment in Chongqing and payment in installments in Shanghai, the head office of the Central Bank has formulated them and the Ministry has approved them, but they have not yet been issued to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Advocate Postponing Payment of Municipal Council Land Tax from This Year to 1941 and Advocate Requesting Reassessment of Land Value Tax</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reported yesterday (the 15th) that Japanese residents and property owners in this city started a campaign on Saturday (the 14th) to postpone the payment of land tax to the Municipal Council from January 1st of this year to June 30th, 1941. The Shanghai Japanese Residents Land Owners Association held a meeting on Saturday, lasting three hours, advocating the reassessment of the value of land owned by Japanese residents. The current tax is the land tax of 1936, which is based on the land value surveyed as far back as 1933. Japanese residents and property owners originally advocated not paying land tax in January of last year, but because some property owners had already paid the land tax when this proposal was made, the campaign failed. Under normal circumstances, the Japanese residents' payment to the Municipal Council, which is only the land tax, reaches 350,000 yuan annually. The newspaper further acknowledged that even if the property owners' request for postponement can be realized, the economic benefits they gain are also minimal. However, the success of this negotiation can have beneficial repercussions in the Japanese mainland. The newspaper further stated that the Japanese residents' request for the Municipal Council to consider is based on "the new situation created in this city after the Japanese army and navy made valuable sacrifices."</p>
<h3>President Pierce Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow; Departs for Hong Kong and Little Luzon on the 20th at 8:00 AM</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' ships stopped operating on the Far East routes after the August 13th Incident two years ago. After more than a year, the company was reorganized in October of last year and renamed the American President Lines. At the same time, it planned to resume the Far East routes, etc., as previously reported. Now it is learned that the first ship to arrive in Shanghai to resume the Far East routes is the President Pierce, which set sail from San Francisco on the 30th of last month. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 18th), but due to slight delays in the ports along the way, it has been delayed by one day. It departs from Kobe today and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at noon on the 19th, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. The passenger launch departs from the Xinguang Wharf at 11:30 am. The ship is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and Little Luzon at 8:00 am on the 20th. The passenger launch departs from the Xinguang Wharf at 1:00 am on the evening of the 19th. After arriving at Little Luzon, the ship returns to the United States, passing through Hong Kong and Japan, without stopping in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Uninterrupted Arrival of European Immigrants in Shanghai; Aid Difficulties; International Relief Society Approaching Collapse; No Concrete Assistance from New York and London</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, although the immigrant residences in this city are full and insufficient, two more batches of German Jewish immigrants arrived in Shanghai at the end of last week. The first batch of 44 people was carried by a certain Japanese cargo ship from Dalian and arrived in port on the evening of Saturday (the 14th). The second batch was larger in number, arriving on the Italian postal ship Victoria yesterday morning (the 15th), totaling</p>
<p>Two Hundred and Forty People</p>
<p>including two children. These newly arrived immigrants are temporarily residing in Riverside Mansion. Last night, a senior official of the committee said that the refugee relief committee is approaching collapse. Shanghai cannot take care of them. The people of Shanghai have done what they can and will do their best to provide assistance to these unfortunate people, but this is a</p>
<p>Worldwide Justice</p>
<p>issue, not just an issue for war-torn Shanghai. To date, no concrete assistance has been received from New York and London. According to reports, including the newly arrived, there will be 1,800 Jewish immigrants in Shanghai. According to rumors, 300 of these immigrants will</p>
<p>Be Allowed to Move to Tianjin</p>
<p>However, according to a member of the relief committee, no official notification has been received regarding the permission for Jewish refugees to move to Tianjin. Most of those who arrived in Shanghai yesterday came from Berlin and Vienna, and most of them were dressed elegantly, carrying a large amount of luggage, mostly shop owners, clerks, and merchants, etc.</p>
<h3>Domestic Air Parcels; Post Office Suspends Sending Due to Scarcity of Aircraft and Transportation Difficulties</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received a report from the Hong Kong Postal Administration that due to the scarcity of aircraft flights and transportation difficulties, air parcels forwarded to various places have accumulated like mountains. From now on, the acceptance of domestic air parcels to Wanxian, Chongqing, Chengdu, Luzhou, Xuzhou, Jiading, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Kunming, Ningxia, Wuzhou, Guilin, Liuzhou, Changsha and other places will be suspended. After receiving the report, the Shanghai Post Office suspended the acceptance of these parcels from yesterday and issued a notice from the Parcel Post Group stating, "Due to transportation difficulties and the scarcity of aircraft, the acceptance of all air parcels to various places is temporarily suspended from today." It is said that acceptance will resume in two weeks.</p>
<h3>Traitors and Soldiers of Fortune Rampant in Changkuncheng Three Counties; Chinese Army Prepares to Encircle and Suppress; Xiong Jiandong's Forces Have Advanced to Areas Along the Yangtze River; The Soldiers of Fortune Under the Command of Zhang Mufang Have Mutinied</h3>
<p>Xu Fengzao, Zhao Peizhi, Yang Xingfang, and others, the "Pacification Team Leaders" of Changshu, Kunshan, and Chengxiang counties, willingly driven by the enemy, recognizing the thief as their father, and endangering the locality. The Chinese army stationed north and south of the Yangtze River has reached a grand alliance, determined to suppress them severely. Zhang Mufang's soldiers of fortune in Hupu, on the other hand, are cooperating with the Chinese army and have mutinied one after another. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Appointed as Traitorous Officials</p>
<p>Zhao Peizhi, Yi Hualong, Zhao Peifang, local hooligan Xu Fengzao of Jiangbei, and Yang Xingfang, commander of the 6th Detachment of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army of the former Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee, and others, have recently been used by the Japanese side to accept traitorous appointments as "Pacification Team Leaders" of Changshu, Kunshan, and Jiangyin counties, recruiting more than a thousand local bandits, ruffians, and vagrants, distributing them in the Hupu and Zhangjiagang areas, recognizing the thief as their father, seeking refuge with the Japanese side, committing all kinds of evils, kidnapping people for ransom, forcibly robbing women, endangering the locality, and being extremely unlawful.</p>
<p>Joint Suppression</p>
<p>Since Zhao and others defected, they have gone to great lengths to curry favor with the Japanese side, even accepting enemy conspiracies and implementing the poisonous plan of using Chinese to control Chinese. Various regular Chinese armies, including Xiong Jiandong and Cai Runqi, jointly persuaded them to rein in their horses, hoping they would repent, but Zhao and others were willing to be lackeys of the tiger, not only refusing to wake up and repent but intensifying their efforts, harming innocent people, killing young patriotic youths, and so on, one after another. Therefore, Xiong, Cai, and others, unable to bear it any longer, will unite with the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu to suppress them severely. It is now learned that Xiong's forces have advanced to areas along the Yangtze River and the urban area, and battles in Hupu, Yinsha, and other places are about to break out.</p>
<p>Zhang's Soldiers Mutiny</p>
<p>Zhang Mufang, who was once the brigade commander of the traitorous "Pacification Team," had no choice but to associate with Zhao and Yang on the surface due to the surrounding environment, in order to cope with the situation, but secretly cooperated with Xiong and Cai early on, maintaining close contact. Part of the traitorous Pacification Team under Zhang's command has mutinied, and the rest remain stationed along the port, waiting for an opportunity to respond, so as to eliminate all bandits and traitors. According to people from the interior, because the Japanese side lacks sufficient troops to control, it is using traitors to do their utmost to win over bandit troops, reorganize them, and send them to various ports and urban areas for garrison. Only a hundred or so Japanese soldiers remain in the urban area, responsible for monitoring the actions of the bandit traitorous armies.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Association Representatives Petition the Municipal Council; Request Exemption from Trimming Handles and Modifying Wheels; Chief of the Vehicle Department Agrees to Forward to the Bureau for Consideration</h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association of this city reported that because the Municipal Council shortened the handles of rickshaws and ordered the modification of rubber wheel edges, they were unable to obtain operating licenses, causing panic in their livelihoods, and requested relief. The association convened a temporary general meeting of directors and supervisors at its association at No. 24 Furun Lane, Guizhou Road, the night before, and notified the members to register to consolidate mutual aid strength. At 2:00 pm yesterday, representatives were sent to the Municipal Council to petition. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The association's temporary emergency meeting held that the Municipal Council's shortening of rickshaw handles and forcing the widening of iron wheel edges hindered the members' work and affected their livelihoods. The association had previously written to the bureau requesting that the original appearance be maintained, but there had been no response, causing panic among the members, and the situation was becoming increasingly serious. Members came to the association one after another to request negotiations, and it was decided to send Secretary-General Ge Futian to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession to state the difficult livelihood situation of the members.</p>
<p>Notice to Members</p>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, there have been many changes in the association's membership. Members are hereby notified that the registration of members will be re-organized from today, with the association located at No. 24, Lane 290, Guizhou Road, Beijing Road, and will be open as usual. In order to care for the members, the arrears of membership fees after the war will be waived. Regarding the Municipal Council's shortening of rickshaw handles and ordering the modification of wide iron wheels, the matter is closely related to the vital interests of the industry, and colleagues still need to automatically unite and contact each other to consolidate the strength of mutual aid and jointly respond.</p>
<p>Representatives Petition</p>
<p>At 2:00 pm yesterday, Zou Shisong, Ke Huaxin, and Gao Youyu were selected as representatives, accompanied by Secretary-General Ge Futian, to petition the Municipal Council. The representatives first visited Deputy Director-General He De Kui and explained everything. They then went to the Vehicle Department, where they were received by Director Baker. The representatives explained in detail the difficult livelihood of the rickshaw pullers, their inability to modify the wheels, and the various inconveniences after shortening the handles. The Chief of the Vehicle Department agreed to forward it to the bureau for consideration.</p>
<h3>Central Government Rectifies Party Discipline; Party Workers Must Not Leave Their Posts Without Authorization; Those Who Do Will Be Investigated by Party Committees at All Levels and Replaced</h3>
<p>The Central Executive Committee recently ordered party committees at all levels that during the national crisis, all party workers should redouble their efforts and be at the forefront of the people. Recently, among the members of party committees at all levels, some have been officially appointed but do not report to their posts without asking for leave, or make excuses not to go, or even if they report to their posts, they do not work at the party committee's location. There are also those who have been resolved to be sent to guide outer counties, but they make excuses not to set off even though they do not hold important military or political positions. In this situation, there is no party discipline to speak of, which greatly hinders the progress of party affairs. Party committees at all levels should investigate and replace those who do so. For those working comrades who leave their posts without authorization without following the leave regulations, the chairmen should strictly prohibit them. Orders have already been issued to the party committees of all provinces and counties to comply with and instruct their subordinates to comply with uniformly.</p>

<h3>French Newspaper Reports That Southwest China's Transportation Construction Will Never Again Be Blockaded by the Japanese, Strengthening the Belief That Resistance Will Surely Be Won</h3>
<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily News reported that the southwestern provinces of China are currently rushing to build two railway lines to reach foreign countries, one from Kunming directly to Burma and the other from Kunming directly to Suifu, Sichuan. It is reported that the former is 713 kilometers long and the latter is 774 kilometers long, which will be fully completed in 1941. This "hinterland" of China will never again be blockaded by the Japanese, and the Chinese people's fierce construction of these two transportation routes further shows their belief that resistance will surely be won, which will become more and more firm. It is reported that in addition to these two railway lines, several highways are being built to connect Kunming and Burma, one of which is a main road that can be opened to traffic as early as May this year. After the road is built, if 100 trucks transport goods on it every day, each truck can carry 200 tons, and millions of tons of military supplies can be easily and quickly transported. It is a pity that this road will inevitably have some traffic limitations when the dry season begins. It is also reported that the British loan of 100,000 pounds will be used entirely for the purchase of vehicles. According to foreign sources, since the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the British trade in the Yangtze River and the Xijiang River has declined greatly. Now, they may be able to rely on these new southwestern transportation routes to make up for their losses.</p>
<h3>Father Rhaou Brings Refugee Fund; Will Do His Best to Find Work for Refugees; Prevent Reception Centers from Becoming Social Blights</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Father Rhaou returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 15th) from the interior. He said that Madame Chiang Kai-shek is very active in caring for and educating Chinese refugees in her current work. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is currently traveling all over the country and is extremely busy. Although the Chairman and his wife have very little free time, they still cordially received him. Father Rhaou's return to Shanghai this time has</p>
<p>Chairman and Wife's</p>
<p>photograph with personal signatures and a large sum of money from the Central Government to Father Rhaou to be used as a refugee fund, which is the harvest of Father Guan's trip. Father Rhaou added that Chongqing itself has very few signs of war, but the government and the public have expressed their determination to work hard and with one heart. Guilin is a</p>
<p>Beautiful Small City</p>
<p>which is now half destroyed. Father Zhao replied to the question about a number of Italian priests engaged in espionage in northern Hunan, "I don't believe it. The matter has been investigated, and I personally believe that the truth will come out about what happened. I admire the refugee relief work done by the American Catholic Church in Hankou, which is led by Bishop Ah Luo, who is an American. The refugees and the Japanese army are suffering from malaria. The Chinese authorities in the interior are doing their best to send refugees to</p>
<p>Suitable Work</p>
<p>areas. This is a smart policy. Now that I have come to Shanghai, I will also do my best to find appropriate work for refugees in this city and seek to prevent refugee reception centers from gradually becoming social blights through the use of labor."</p>
<h3>Global Wireless Electric Company Responds to Debt Repayment Campaign</h3>
<p>The Chinese, American, and British employees of the Global Wireless Electric Company, located at 51 Guangdong Road, in view of the news that the One Yuan Debt Repayment Campaign has been widely supported, voluntarily donated 39 yuan in cash and entrusted it to the bank for remittance yesterday (the 16th) (obtained Remittance Order No. 784). Although the amount of this donation is small, it is commendable even compared to foreign aid. It is difficult and valuable enough, and it is hoped that the future will be brighter.</p>
<h3>Fellow Traders Participating in Illegal Exchanges Will Be Severely Sanctioned in Accordance with the Regulations; The Ministries of Finance and Economics Have Already Launched an Investigation; Sales Contracts Are Denied</h3>
<p>The Ministries of Finance and Economics believed that the operation of exchanges should not be operated by foreign merchants, and any attempts by foreign merchants to set up exchanges in Shanghai should be strictly prohibited. Chinese merchants participating in such illegal organizations are clearly attempting to manipulate and disrupt finances and should be punished in accordance with the law to serve as a warning. The two ministries jointly sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice and Administration to investigate the tissue market in accordance with the law, and for the conditions of brokerage disputes in the exchange, if those who are not sold in the exchange established in accordance with the law, their sales behaviors and their contracts should be considered invalid. All industries in Shanghai must not participate in such unauthorized organizations, and if there are violations of the rules, severe sanctions will be imposed in accordance with the rules of the association.</p>
<h3>Wartime Shanghai Postal Service</h3>
<p>— Not Classical</p>
<p>Among the national government organs on today's "isolated island," the only ones that can maintain their relatively complete structures in the face of a precarious situation are the Postal Service and the Customs Office. Since the raising of the five-colored flag in Shanghai, the old prestige has gradually declined. Only the Postal Service has been able to calmly cope and stand on its own. Tracing back the reasons, there are several factors: first, the consistency of international relations; second, the needs of society; third, the efforts of postal workers; and fourth, the appropriate handling by the postal authorities. Lacking any one of these four, the Postal Service would not be able to have its current appearance. This can be definitively stated. However, there have been inevitable changes in the minor branches and details. The national economy is difficult, and attention should be paid to it. Therefore, based on what I know, I will describe them in the following points, titled "Wartime Shanghai Postal Service," so that we can learn from the past and distinguish the future.</p>
<p>A Brief History of the Postal Service</p>
<p>To understand the current state of the Postal Service, one must first trace its evolution. The development of postal communications in China began in the Zhou Dynasty, either by foot or by horse. Successive dynasties followed suit, with few advancements. It was not until after the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty that merchant disasters arose. In response to the needs of commerce, private letter offices were established, densely distributed in various locations, interconnected, delivering letters, and delivering silver, which was convenient for merchants. During the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, the court added a bureau for official documents, specializing in distributing official documents for government officials. The postal delivery continued by the customs office also began to accept letters from the people. This was the beginning of the postal service trial. Before this, foreigners, because they considered China without a postal service, and international communication inconvenient, had set up letter offices in treaty ports to handle letters between their countries. Until the establishment of the Chinese postal service, and because of the imperfect system, these continued to grow. The Qing court thought of ways to resist them, consulting in many ways. It was not until February of the 22nd year of Guangxu that the official postal service was finally established. Although the post office had been established, foreign post offices competed, and postal administration was not unified. After several negotiations, it was still not completely resolved. Throughout the Qing Dynasty, they had to be dealt with. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, China requested the abolition of foreign post offices at the Universal Postal Congress. The following year, the United States convened a military disarmament conference, and China reiterated this request. In November, the Committee on Pacific and Far Eastern Questions met, and various organizations accepted this request and abolished them one after another in December of the 11th year of the Republic of China. China then joined the international postal alliance and actively cooperated with the Universal Postal Union. Shortly after the September 18th Incident, the postal area of the three northeastern provinces, which had an annual surplus of two million, was occupied, and the postal economy was greatly affected. In January of the 24th year of the Republic of China, private letter offices throughout the country were acquired by the government and completely shut down. The postal authorities accumulated plans to improve the postal economy, reduce expenses, streamline the organization, and rectify corruption. The combination of various measures compensated for the losses. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the surplus reached six to seven million. Post offices in various locations were further developed. Soon, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the impact continued to come.</p>
<p>Wartime Relocation</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, because the post office was located on North Sichuan Road, close to the Japanese defense zone, rumors arose for a time. However, all postal workers, under the leadership of the director, were able to work calmly. In addition to closing the front doors along North Sichuan Road and Tianmu Road, internal work proceeded as usual. After the August 14th air battle, the Japanese military controlled the lights in the Hongkou district, which hindered the evening work of the post office. During the day, the receipt and dispatch of letters was slow because people were unwilling to go to dangerous areas. The branches in the special zone suddenly became busy. Therefore, on August 16th, the authorities ordered the business and economic departments to be relocated to the following branches for operation:</p>
<p>(1) Yu Garden Road (i.e., the new site of the Jing'an Temple Branch)</p>
<p>(2) Avenue Petain Branch</p>
<p>(3) Jiangxi Road Storage Bureau</p>
<p>With Yu Garden Road as the hub. As for the branches in the local area close to the war zone, such as Tilanqiao, Jielu, and North Sichuan Road branches, they were also suspended. Mail from these branches was collected and left at Avenue Edward VII, Route Cardinal Mercier, Rue Cardinal Foch, and Jing'an Temple Road branches for collection. As for the North Sichuan Road Management Bureau, in addition to the doors being closed, personnel were still sent to guard the premises on a daily basis, rotating in shifts. The director treated the guards as equal to soldiers on the front lines in terms of compensation, saying that guarding the post office was no different from defending the battlefield. Therefore, the driving motive was entirely to facilitate the public. Although the war was extremely fierce, the guarding of the Management Bureau never ceased for a single day.</p>
<p>Establishment and Dissolution of Military Post</p>
<p>During the intense warfare, many troops were stationed in the suburbs. To facilitate the delivery and forwarding of soldiers' letters, a military post group was established in September of the 26th year. Later, as the troops retreated westward, most of the personnel of the group also left with them. Consequently, it was announced that it would be dissolved in December.</p>
<p>Discount on Employee Salaries</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war of resistance, the war zone expanded, and the postal revenue suddenly decreased. The ministry ordered that postal employees' salaries be discounted starting in January. In addition to a living allowance of forty yuan, salaries in non-war zones were reduced by 40%, and those in war zones by 20%. In February of the 27th year, it was revised to a living allowance of thirty yuan. Salaries below 150 yuan were reduced by 20%, those between 150 and 300 yuan by 30%, and those above 300 yuan by 40%. There were two more revisions in April and May. In June, it was further revised to a living allowance of forty yuan, with salaries below 190 yuan reduced by 20%, and those above 190 yuan reduced by 30%. Currently, there are no changes. In February, a plan to evacuate employees was also discussed, dividing them into "enemy-occupied" and "waiting at home." This was opposed by all employees, and the matter was not implemented. Instead, some people were instigated to become traitors and distribute leaflets, intending to stir up trouble and profit from it. However, because all employees understood the greater good and were not swayed, all difficulties were safely overcome. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Threatened and Blackmailed for Introducing Lawsuits, With Bullets as Gifts</p>
<p>Ji Xiao was not only extorted but also falsely accused. Zhang Guohua, an employee of the Empress Theatre, was arrested.</p>
<p>Ji Wanfeng, residing at No. 6, Lane 81, Peng Road, has been enthusiastically involved in legal matters in recent years, inevitably incurring both gratitude and resentment. At about 8:00 a.m. on the 3rd of this month, a man suddenly arrived at his home, offering a box of pastries as a gift. Ji was still asleep, and Ji's wife had gone to the market to buy vegetables. Ji's mother-in-law was alone in the living room. The man handed her the box and left. When Ji's wife returned, she temporarily placed the box in a drawer. When Ji got up, his wife told him about it. Ji curiously opened the box and discovered</p>
<p>Five Bullets</p>
<p>Scattered inside the box. He immediately reported the incident to the police station under the jurisdiction of the French Concession for investigation. Up to this day, Ji grasped a clue from Xi Runchu and asked the police to send detectives to the Empress Theatre of the New World on Yu Qiaqing Road, where they arrested Zhang Tiehua, an employee of Suzhou origin. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Dai opened the court for interrogation. After the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case, he requested a postponement because the case still needed investigation. The defendant firmly denied the accusation. The prosecutor submitted a case by the plaintiff Ji Xiaofeng, stating that after the incident of finding bullets in the box,</p>
<p>The Whole Situation</p>
<p>He said that he had no grudges with anyone outside of work, so he did not know who was behind it. However, at noon on the 5th, he suddenly received a threatening phone call, saying that he must not go out today, as there was a great danger waiting for him. However, because he needed to go to a certain lawyer's office to discuss fees for introducing a case, he first notified the lawyer by phone and then went. He told the lawyer about the incident. The lawyer immediately asked about the people who threatened him and warned Wang Yigong, who made the phone call, not to act rashly. But on the 8th, he received another phone call. At first, he wanted to go to the Youth Association, then he was taken to the</p>
<p>Oriental Hotel</p>
<p>room, where the other party, Mr. Yu and a Mr. Gao, who did not speak, demanded 2,800 yuan from him. He then accused Zhang Guohua of being an accessory in the case of Wang Yigong threatening him. Wang Yigong was at the Youth Association, directing by phone. On the day of the negotiation, he was willing to settle for one or two hundred yuan, but the other party repeatedly demanded more, insisting on 1,800 yuan, and no agreement was reached. Later, Zhang testified in the Second Special Court that he was the instigator. The day before yesterday, because someone said that Xi Runchu had witnessed the person who delivered the cake, he repeatedly inquired with Xi. At first, he was unwilling to speak directly, but later agreed to guide the detectives to the</p>
<p>Empress Theatre</p>
<p>to search, and then clearly identified the defendant, etc. When questioned, Zhang stated that the police had recently been investigating Chen, his boss, for threatening him. According to Chen, he was Ji Xiaofeng's follower. Ji had visited his house several times on the 27th and 28th of last month, but he did not know Ji at all. The threatening case that the police are now prosecuting has not yet been concluded, etc. Zhang still refused to admit that he had sent the cake to Ji's house, as he had done at the police station. Judge Dai Rongduo, considering the complexity of the case, ordered Ji Xiaofeng to submit a detailed account of the incident in writing for further investigation. The defendant, Zhang Guohua, was taken back to the police station for detention, and the hearing was postponed pending investigation. A small motorboat, belonging to Nisshin Shadu, moored near the Dongma Wharf in the Huangpu River, suddenly exploded at 9:21 p.m. on Saturday (the 14th). Within ten minutes, the bottom of the boat was pierced, and it sank immediately. Several crew members were rescued by the Jianghai Customs small vessel, but one Japanese was killed.</p>
<p>Car Accident at Rue Bourgeat Kills Young Man on Bicycle</p>
<p>A young man in his twenties was riding a bicycle at the intersection of Rue Bourgeat and Rue Amiral Bayle at 3:45 p.m. yesterday when he was struck by a public bus. He sustained serious injuries and was sent to the Baolong Hospital by officer No. 2777 of the Chinese police force. He died before reaching the hospital due to the severity of his injuries. The body was transferred to the morgue.</p>
<p>Russian Sentenced to Three Months for Assaulting Hospital Director</p>
<p>Wang Simo, the director of the Second Special District Local Court, was driving his own car, No. 11857, with his driver Yao Rongfu, a Ningbo native, at 1:00 p.m. this month. As they entered Lane 6, No. 79, Rue du Consulat, a private residence, and reached the second side lane, a drunken Russian, Yevgeni Ivanchugov, (31 years old, residing at No. 1337 Rue Amiral Bayle), was</p>
<p>Standing in the Road</p>
<p>Blocking the car's passage. The driver Yao Rongfu rebuked him, but the Russian began to assault Yao, causing injuries. Director Wang, witnessing the scene from inside the car, got out and questioned him in English. The Russian not only refused to obey but also punched Wang in the head, shattering his glasses. The police arrived and arrested the Russian. Wang and Yao declined to press charges, but the driver Yao Rongfu, because of his</p>
<p>Serious Injuries, requested that the police prosecute him and went to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The Russian, after being investigated by the police, was found to have been previously fined 60 yuan by the Second Special District Court for assaulting someone. He was immediately sent to the Second Special District Court. The administrative authorities of the French Concession filed a public lawsuit against him for assault. Judge Qiu Huan Ying held two hearings, and the plaintiff Yao Rongfu also appeared in court to describe the assault. The defendant admitted to being drunk and could not deny it. The closing arguments were concluded, and a date was set for sentencing. The circumstances have been recorded in this newspaper. At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, Judge Qiu delivered the verdict in the criminal court, sentencing Yevgeni Ivanchugov to three months of imprisonment for assault. During the appeal period, the defendant will remain in custody.</p>
<p>Chauffeur of Yuan Lao Liu Sold Car for Embezzlement Case Concluded</p>
<p>Chauffeur and related persons directly admitted to the truth. All defendants were remanded for sentencing on the 23rd. Liang Alin, a Shanghai native, the chauffeur hired by Yuan Shikai's sixth son Yuan Lao Liu, fraudulently claimed to Kunlin, his neighbor on Rue du Consulat, to Hu, a chauffeur employed by Tian Baixiang of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. on Rue du Consulat, that his employer's car was for sale. Hu, knowing that his employer intended to purchase a vehicle, immediately paid Liang a deposit of 200 yuan,</p>
<p>Believing it to be true, as a deposit. Subsequently, negotiations took place, and on the 8th of this month, the agreed-upon price was 3,500 yuan. However, after receiving the payment, he failed to deliver the car. Tian Baixiang's son, You Nian, reported Liang to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The police dispatched detectives and arrested Liang, Qi Cao Cailin and Zhao Maolin, who were suspected of conspiracy. All the money was recovered from Cao's residence and sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. The details have been reported previously. Yesterday morning, Judge Di Rongfeng conducted a trial</p>
<p>Defendant Brought to Court</p>
<p>And continued the interrogation of Liang, Cao, and Zhao. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the recovered 3,500 yuan had been fully returned to Tian Baixiang. As for the 200 yuan received earlier, according to Liang's own confession, he had lost it all in the gambling den in Yidingcheng Wucaojie, so the money could not be recovered. When questioned, Liang Alin confessed that he had initially made a joke about his employer wanting to sell the car, but Tian's chauffeur actually believed it and paid him a deposit of 200 yuan. He then gambled away the money, which prompted the idea of fraud, hoping to recover his losses through the fraudulently obtained money. Although he asked Cao to go to No. 75 Rue Moliere that day,</p>
<p>Cao was Unaware</p>
<p>He only told Cao that it was money earned from selling Tian's property when he asked him to take it back to hide. Cao Cailin admitted to hiding the money for Liang, but he was unaware of the fraud. After the cross-examination between the defendant's defense lawyer Fan Gangyin and the police lawyer concluded, the court ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody for sentencing on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>The General Headquarters of a Pickpocket Gang: Gambling and Drug Use Included; Two Rooms Opened in the Continental Apartments; Detectives Arrest 26 Men and Women</p>
<p>There are many pickpockets in Shanghai. Previously, they were scattered in Pudong and the South City, relying on the French Concession for success, returning to their lair to hide and divide the spoils. After the outbreak of war two years ago, these people also took refuge in the French Concession, specializing in picking pockets on crowded trams and buses. Now, detectives from the French Concession police have discovered that these people are now at No. 21 West Xiangyang Road</p>
<p>Continental Apartments</p>
<p>Rented Rooms 224 and 226 as their general headquarters, and had equipped them with various gambling instruments and opium for smoking to serve the needs of all involved. Gambling went on until daybreak, being very lively. At midnight of the tenth of this month, a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to surround the location. In Room 224, they found a game of Pai Gow being played, crowded with people in high spirits, while in Room 226, there were nearly ten people, each holding a small pipe and</p>
<p>Smoking Opium</p>
<p>Among them were Liu San, Jia Laisheng, Kong Bingren, Wang Zhongwen, Yang Jiren, Chen Yangqiao, Pan Ziyao, Wu Peisheng Xu Xiaoerzi, Wang Genlong, Zhang Xiaowuzi, Zhu Maotang, Shen Guoliang, Xi Chunhui, Chen Wenlin, Yang Qingkui, Mao A Jin, Jiang Yuehui, Chen A Bing, Wang Ruifu, and the women Hu Pengshi, Yang Zhoushi, Zhang Shenshi, Wang Wangying, (and the dancer) Zhao Tianying, a total of twenty-six men and women. They seized</p>
<p>Pai Gow Gambling Equipment</p>
<p>Dozens of yuan in gambling money, seven packets of opium, and smoking paraphernalia. They fingerprinted everyone, and more than half of them had records of being punished for theft in the British and French concessions. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District. Judge Liao Tan interrogated them privately. The representative lawyer of the administrative authorities of the French Concession, taught by Shoufu</p>
<p>Explained the Case</p>
<p>And requested a postponement for further investigation and prosecution. Detective Bao Chuanbiao then reported the circumstances of the arrest and search. After the judge questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be remanded in custody for another hearing on the 25th.</p>
<p>Bank of Communications Branch to Open Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications in Shanghai, which has always been known for its services, will host a special banquet tonight to invite celebrities from all walks of life to participate in the opening ceremony. Recently, due to the prosperity of Shanghai, and during this extraordinary period, the need for economic regulation is even more urgent. To expand its service scope, it has invested heavily in a large building located at the intersection of Rue Montauban and Avenue Edward VII, to open a branch. The preparatory office has been actively working, with careful planning. Now, the arrangements have been completed, and the official opening is scheduled for tomorrow (the 18th), with celebrities from Shanghai participating in the opening ceremony. The bank's manager, Mr. Huang Yuzhai, has extensive connections, and it is expected that many people from all walks of life will visit at the time. The bank has also prepared gifts from the United States to be given away to reciprocate the goodwill of all sectors. Last night, Mr. Huang hosted a special banquet at the Bankers' Club on Hong Kong Road, inviting Wu Yunzhai, Lin Kanghou, Jin Zongcheng, He Dekui Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, Zhou Bangjun, Ji Ze, Jiang Wanping, Hu Guigeng, Wei Jin San, Liao Xikang, Lu Yiming, Chen Jicheng, Cao Zhigong, Ge Futian, and dozens of others. The atmosphere was lively, and everyone enjoyed themselves. All sectors expressed their admiration and appreciation for the bank's service spirit and Mr. Huang's meticulous planning.</p>
<p>Fire at Rue du Lieutenant Petiot in the Late Night</p>
<p>Spreads for More Than Four Hours, Burning Six Buildings. A fire broke out at No. 167 Rue du Lieutenant Petiot, near the intersection of Rue Henri Riviere, at about 1:30 a.m. yesterday. Immediately, thick smoke billowed, and flames shot out in all directions. Before long, it had broken through the roof, and the fire was raging. The firefighters from the French Concession rushed to the scene with fire engines to put out the fire. It was not until 5:35 a.m. that the fire was extinguished. As a result, Nos. 167, 168, 169, 270, 171, and 172, a total of six buildings, were burned down, resulting in significant losses. At the time of the fire, it was during the curfew, and the residents were all asleep. Upon being alerted to the fire, they helped the elderly and carried the young, fleeing for their lives. Fortunately, no one was injured. The police sent a large number of detectives to the scene to maintain order, and eventually, the situation was brought under control.</p>
<p>Girl Steals Fabric, Implicating Grandmother</p>
<p>Sentenced to Joint Theft Detention for Fifty Days. Li Ge, a 50-year-old Nanjing native, took her 13-year-old granddaughter, Li Xiuying, to the Dazhong Company on Yu Qiaqing Road at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. Unexpectedly, Xiuying, being young and ignorant, took the opportunity to steal three pieces of fabric worth 18 yuan and gave them to her grandmother. They were spotted by an employee of Dazhong Company, who arrested them and handed them over to the Laozha Police Station, who placed them in custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District. Attorney Zhang Shizhu presented the case, prosecuting them for theft under Article 320 of the criminal code. Li Ge admitted to the theft, while Li Xiuying confessed that she had been momentarily confused and asked for leniency. Attorneys Fan Gang and Yu Enliang appeared in court to argue that Li Ge's husband worked for the railway and was a legitimate employee, so she would not engage in such behavior and should be released. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Fang determined that Li Xiuying should be released due to her age, and Li Ge was sentenced to 50 days of detention, suspended for two years. The stolen goods were returned.</p>
<p>Three Suicide Attempts</p>
<p>Couple Quarrels, Woman Commits Suicide by Poisoning. Chen Zhu, a Ningbo woman, 28 years old, residing at No. 5 Dexing Lane, North Shaanxi Road, worked as a female worker in a certain cigarette factory. Recently, she had an affair, which was discovered by her husband, who reprimanded her. She retorted, and an argument ensued. Afterward, she became weary of life and secretly swallowed opium paste, attempting suicide. She was discovered, and an ambulance was called, rushing her to Huaji Hospital for treatment, but to no avail. She died at 2:50 p.m. yesterday. The hospital reported the incident to the Huiji Police Station, who dispatched detective No. 206 to investigate. After the investigation, the body was sent to the morgue. Zhang Wu, a 15-year-old girl, residing at Room 56, Pacific Hotel, No. 4130 Guangxi Road, Public Concession, was wearing a fur coat and modern attire. At 2:35 p.m. yesterday, for unknown reasons, she swallowed opium, attempting suicide. Before long, the poison took effect, causing vomiting and moaning, which reached outside the room. The tea boy discovered it and reported it to the police, who called an ambulance and rushed her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. It was reported that she had taken too much poison, and her life was in danger. Chen Guangrong, a Ningbo native, 25 years old, checked into Room 11 or 12 of the New China Hotel on Aiwenyi Road from his home the night before. He secretly swallowed a large amount of medicinal liquid, attempting suicide. It was not until 1:00 a.m. yesterday that the tea boy discovered it and immediately sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It was said that he had been deeply poisoned and his life was in danger. It was heard that the reason for his suicide was that he did not engage in proper work and indulged in low-class activities, so he was driven out by his father.</p>
<p>Fire at the Silk Drying Room of the Zhongfu Silk Factory; Cause of Fire Under Investigation. A fire broke out at the Zhongfu Silk Factory drying room, near the mouth of Yaoshui Lane, No. 1501, Lane 21, Xiaoshapu Road, West Shanghai, at 9:20 p.m. last night. Immediately, flames soared, breaking through the roof. The fire department rushed to the scene and began to extinguish the fire. It was extinguished after one hour and thirty minutes. The drying room and part of the factory were burned, resulting in significant losses. The police are currently investigating the cause of the fire.</p>
<p>Fire on Baoding Road; Two Men and Women Burned.</p>
<p>A fire broke out at No. 338 Baoding Road at 8:17 p.m. last night. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Two men and women were burned. The male, Wang Shuxiang (28 years old), suffered burns to his hands, feet, and face, and the elderly woman, Wang Xu (56 years old), suffered burns to both hands. Their conditions were serious. They were transported to the Shanghai East Hospital for treatment by the fire department. The fire was quickly extinguished by firefighters. One room was burned down.</p>
<p>Fake Water Patrol Seizes Smuggled Raw Opium in Donggoupu</p>
<p>Over 1,000 Taels of Opium Seized, Japanese and Puppet Forces Disagree on Sharing the Spoils.</p>
<p>Amid the widespread drug promotion on the outskirts of Shanghai, raw opium is being smuggled into Shanghai. On the waterway, there are also Japanese and puppet forces, as well as gangsters from the Huangpu River, colluding to transport it. Yesterday morning, in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River in Donggoupu, a small boat of unknown nationality suddenly sped in from outside. After a while, about a dozen puppet "police局 water patrol队" puppet police officers, riding a small boat, drove from the upstream, meeting in Lai Gougang and forced the ship to stop. A large batch of raw opium, over a thousand taels, worth 15,000 yuan, was seized from the ship. The small boat was taken away, and the boatman was detained. The exact details of what was going on are unknown. It is said that the puppet side’s profit distribution was uneven, leading to mutual infighting, and this strange drama. It is reported that a yellow-hulled small boat with no name was detained by the puppet "water patrol force" at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong. According to the puppet agency, the ship was privately transporting raw opium, but when they went to search, they found nothing, and three people on the ship had escaped. It is said that the opium had been transferred early, because local merchants along the Caojingdu一带, have special power. After this, opium entering, except for those protected by armed forces, will be intercepted. However, it is generally believed that this situation will soon change.</p>
<p>Exposure of Theft by Impersonating Someone to Receive Clothing; Cutting Thief Gang Smashed</p>
<p>Gu Hongyi Imprisoned for Greed; Two Women Released as Not Involved.</p>
<p>Ruan Wenyun, an employee of the Dazhong Company, residing at No. 18 Rue Massenet, French Concession, took a crowded bus on the 13th of this month at about 10:00 a.m. to go to his company for business. Unexpectedly, on the bus on Avenue Eduard VII, his wallet suddenly disappeared. In the wallet, in addition to 15 yuan in legal tender, there was also a Dazhong Company badge and several</p>
<p>Laundry Receipts</p>
<p>From the Da Guangming Laundry on No. 90 Rue Cardinal Mercier. Ruan did not report it to the police at the time but notified Da Guangming Laundry that if someone came with his receipts to pick up the clothes, they could be detained. Until the day before yesterday, the 19-year-old Gu Xuezhen and the 20-year-old Sha Shunying went to Da Guangming Laundry to pick up clothes and were detained. The French police were notified, who informed the Chengdu Road Police Station. Chinese detective Che Xueceng went to arrest the two women.</p>
<p>Under Questioning</p>
<p>It became clear that the laundry receipt was given to them by Gu's brother, Gu Hongyi. Gu's house was at No. 212, Lane 205, Rue Amiral Courbet. The detectives went to arrest Gu Hongyi. According to the testimony, the receipt was sold to him by Hua Gui from Suzhou, and he was told to return it to Ruan Wenlian of Dazhong Company along with the seal. He was greedy for a while, took the clothes and swallowed them. The police also arrested Hua Guizhen. He confessed that another five people were working together for</p>
<p>Pickpocketing</p>
<p>And other people. The police also arrested Lin Gusheng. Because the two women Gu and Sha were unrelated to the crime, they were released, and only Gu, Hua, and Mang were detained. Yesterday morning, they were all sent to the Criminal Court of the First District. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, filed charges, and requested a postponement. Judge Xiao Peishen briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to be detained pending further investigation on the 23rd.</p>
<p>A Fugitive From 29 Years Ago, Now Imprisoned Again; Old Sentence Not Completed, Not To Be Re-Executed; Now Imprisoned for Selling Raw Opium for Six Months.</p>
<p>Recently, detectives from the Public Concession police uncovered a case of selling raw opium at No. 60 Yuegui Lane, Guangdong Road, and arrested the criminal Wang Kailiang. He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment by the First Special District Local Court. It is learned that Wang Kailiang committed a major armed crime during the Xuantong period of the late Qing Dynasty. He was arrested by the police and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment by the Shanghai Mixed Court on January 20, the first year of the Republic of China. After entering the prison, he became ill and was sent to the Concession Police Hospital for treatment. On May 22 of that year, he escaped after recovering. He has been missing ever since. At that time, the prisoner was 20 years old, and he is now 57 years old. The old sentence will not be executed again. Therefore, when he was sent to prison yesterday, he only had to serve the six-month sentence for the new case.</p>

<h3>Amateur Performers Form Fundraising Association – Organization Established – All Theaters in the City Participate – Decision to Raise Donations to Run Activities</h3>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Amateur Performers Group of the Municipal Refugee Relief Association, in order to adjust its organization and increase its strength, held a joint meeting of representatives of all theaters and amateur performers in the city at the Shipping Club at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Association, personally attended to provide guidance. The committee members were re-elected, the proposals were passed, and the formal establishment was announced. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Representatives</p>
<p>The representatives attending the meeting included Chairman of the Association Yu Qiaqing, Deputy Directors Jin Tingsun (represented by Jin Yuansheng), Yuan Ludeng, and representatives from various theaters, including Zhengyi Society, Letian Collection, Shengyi Society, Silver Industry, Times, Sheng Society, Zhongjiu Society, Liangyou, Donglian, Pharmacy Society, Ping Society, Leshan, Yi Society, Yayan, Dacheng, Siming, Guoju, Wuyun Collection, Yongheng Bank Club, Lianyi Lisha, Zhongnan, and Pinghe. Bao Youdie, Huang Xiubo, Jun Daren, Jiang Bogong, Fan Weilin, Xu Qinfang, Gua Dong, Li Yuanlong, Sun Junqing, Fa Laihui, Jia Yaying, and E Zhaoxiong, totaling over one hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng presided over the meeting. After the meeting began, the chairman delivered a speech, stating that since the Refugee Association officially declared its establishment on October 18th last year, it has received enthusiastic participation and donations from various industry groups and citizens throughout the city, resulting in remarkable achievements. Today, the Amateur Performers Group Fundraising Association is holding a general meeting, and everyone has been able to take time out of their busy schedules to attend, which is truly commendable. On behalf of the Association and the refugees throughout the city, I extend my deepest gratitude. The organization of the Amateur Performers Group was originally initiated by the Association and sponsored by Mr. Jin Tingsun. Therefore, the group began its work, and although the fundraising results have only been temporary, thanks to the efforts of the preparatory committee members, the donations have already exceeded ten thousand yuan. However, we dare not be complacent about this. In order to increase our fundraising strength, we hope that all amateur performers in the city will mobilize and participate enthusiastically to contribute to this righteous cause. Therefore, we believe that there is still a need to adjust the organizational approach, so we are reconvening this general meeting. We hope that everyone will uphold the spirit of doing good and not yielding to others, and make their greatest efforts for the refugees in Shanghai who are struggling and helpless. We are truly moved by your dedication. Mr. Sun Lanting reported on the organizational process and the amount of donations raised, omitting the details.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Instructions</p>
<p>Next, Chairman of the Association Yu Qiaqing gave instructions, stating that there are originally 100,000 refugees in the city, and the monthly food and clothing expenses require more than 300,000 yuan. Since the establishment of the Association, we have been actively working to reorganize and assist them. In addition to the refugee areas in the southern city, recent statistics on the refugees aided by the two concessions have shown that we have assisted over 40,000 people. With the strength of Shanghai's four million citizens, providing relief to over 40,000 refugees should not be too difficult. The Association's relief work focuses on the aftermath, and we plan to raise one million yuan to carry out the following plans:</p>
<p>(1) To establish more educational institutions for children to provide them with education. (2) To establish factories to enable adult refugees to engage in productive labor and earn a living. (3) The elderly, weak, and disabled will be fully supported by the Association. In addition, we also plan to establish more hospitals to pay attention to refugee hygiene in order to promote health. All of this requires the concerted efforts of enthusiastic people from all walks of life to complete this arduous mission.</p>
<p>Elected Committee Members</p>
<p>The re-election of the committee members resulted in the following: (Chairman) Jin Tingsun, (Vice-Chairman) Yuan Ludeng, (Committee Members) Sun Lanting, Jin Yuansheng, Bao Xiaodie, Yuan Senqi, Zhao Peijin, Wu Jiangfeng, Zai Qijun, Chao Jimei, Na Xujiu, Wu Laidai, Yao Shaobing, Huang Xiuqin, Zhang Zhongyuan, E Zhaoxiong, Sun Junqing, Luan Wu, Wu Yingsun, Xie Wenyuan, Gu Senbo, Cheng Junmou, Fan Weilin, Zhang Boge, Chuan Rushan, Hua Zhenya, Wang Yiqiu, Jiang Bogong, Zhang Zhesheng, Yu Yungu, Yin Zhenxian, Shao Daren, Luo Liangsheng, Xu Shaoping, Jiang Heshan, Wu Lizhi, Hu Fangguan, Cao Ke, Lu Moshen, Bai Yiliang, Zhu Yinliang, Liu Ruzhan, Zhu Jianhong, Chen Liangyu, Wu Kesun, Pang Bingxia, Rong Ruichang, Dai Xingyi, Bao Youdie, Zhang Yizhai, Cui Tixian, Li Jinxiang, Chen Chuan. In addition, the following were also elected: representatives from the Pinghe Racing Club, the Central Savings Society, the Mi Society, the Minghe, and the Central theaters.</p>
<p>Fundraising Methods</p>
<p>Next, the proposals were discussed. In addition to amending the articles of association, the committee also discussed how to raise funds. After discussion by the entire body, the following three principles were adopted:</p>
<p>(1) Theaters throughout the city will regularly hold charity performances for ten days, with the location at the former Golden Theater. (2) A general assembly will be held regularly, bringing together famous male and female performers in the city, and inviting sick performers to hold a Peking opera singing fundraising event for three days. (3) Amateur performers participating in celebratory performances should request the association's notice, and the association will solicit refugee donations from the middleman. All three of the above-mentioned methods were handed over to the committee for discussion and implementation. Soon after, the entire group took a photo and announced the successful conclusion of the meeting. It is reported that the committee has borrowed the Shipping Club as its office address, and has scheduled the first committee meeting for 6:00 PM on the 16th to divide up the work and actively carry it out.</p>
<h3>French Concession Authorities Prepare to Award Service Medals</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", the Shanghai Municipal Council awarded medals to police officers of all ranks who served during the Shanghai war crisis of the previous year. The French Concession has recently decided to award medals as well, but only to members of the Volunteer Corps and special detectives. The regulations for awarding medals have been published in the Municipal Council Gazette. Once approved by the French Consul General in Shanghai, the commanders of the Volunteer Corps and special detectives will determine the recipients. At least a certain period of service is required to qualify for the medal. The team to which the recipient belongs will be distinguished by the color of the ribbon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Elect Directors – Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting to be Held on April 19th</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting on the 11th of this month and proposed to elect directors on April 12th and 13th of this year. The annual meeting of foreign ratepayers will be held at the Great Light Theater from 2:30 PM on the 19th of the same month. The proposed plan has been submitted to the Consular Body for consideration.</p>
<h3>After Approval for Loading Cargo, the "De Ping" Steamer Will Sail to Wenzhou and then Ningbo Today</h3>
<p>The Sino-Italian Shipping Company's "En De" and "De Ping" steamers have recently been approved by the Tenth Army Group to sail to Ningbo. After loading cotton, the "En De" steamer sailed to Wenzhou and then Ningbo on the afternoon of the 13th. The "De Ping" steamer also returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou on the 14th and was originally scheduled to join the voyage to Ningbo yesterday. However, due to insufficient cargo loading, it has been changed to sailing to Wenzhou and then Ningbo this afternoon. After loading cotton in Ningbo, it will return directly to Shanghai. All freight rates will be reduced by half, following the example of the "En De" steamer. As for Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Mou Qian" steamer, after sailing to Ningbo on the morning of the 13th, the company received a telegram stating that it has been scheduled to return directly to Shanghai today and will dock tomorrow morning, continuing to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo route.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Frequently Intercept Along the Port – Japanese Ship Cargo Transportation is Bleak – Inland Waterways Steamers Also Fall into Decline</h3>
<p>The Nissin Steamship Company received orders from the Japanese military to implement transportation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and transferred steamers to operate in the ports of Jiujiang, Wuhu, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, and other ports, totaling fifty or sixty ships. At first, cargo transportation was quite developed, but in the last year or two, due to the extraordinary activity of the guerrilla forces in various ports, Japanese ships were frequently intercepted, resulting in the loss of silver. Most merchants did not dare to load their goods, and the passengers were often subjected to abuse and violence by the Japanese military escorts. Therefore, the business of the company's steamers has plummeted. Furthermore, the Jiangxin Steamer Company, which also belongs to the Nissin Steamship Company, operates the riverboat cargo transportation between Suzhou Creek and Huangpu, which has also become very sluggish.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Transportation to Yunnan – Collection of Special Transit Tax – Implemented from January 1st of this Year</h3>
<p>Implemented from January 1st of this year, in order to develop Southwest trade, a large number of cigarettes manufactured in Shanghai are transported from Haiphong to Kunming and then sold inland. It is reported that the Yunnan Provincial Education Funding Administration has drafted six measures for collecting special transit taxes on cigarettes and submitted them to the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education for approval. In addition, they have also drafted twenty-five articles for provisional measures for collecting special transit taxes, stipulating that a special tax of seven-tenths of the local sales tax rate will be levied on all cigarettes passing through the border, starting from January 1st of this year. Level B tax offices will be established in the counties of Luyuan and Pingyi to handle tax collection affairs.</p>
<h3>Chinese Delegation Returns to Shanghai After Attending the World Christian Conference in India – Indian People are Very Sympathetic to China's Situation</h3>
<p>According to the Dalu Bao, the fifteen members of the Chinese delegation who participated in the World Christian Conference in Madras, India, returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 15th) aboard the Italian postal steamer Victoria. According to a representative, the number of members in the Chinese delegation was second only to India, which gave other delegations a good impression. They were well-received everywhere. The conference passed a resolution to assist church relief efforts in China and to help refugees. The activities of the twelve-member Japanese delegation attending the conference were minimal. In general, we found that the Indian people are very sympathetic to China's current situation. Among the Indian people themselves, the enthusiastic spirit of nationalism is increasing rapidly, and dissatisfaction with the Indian Congress Party is also increasing. Gandhi is a powerful figure in India, and most of his power lies in the fact that no one dares to oppose him. However, many younger factions are turning to Nehru as their leader. Nehru is a descendant of the aristocracy but expresses strong socialist tendencies. Some people in India call Gandhi the greatest friend of the British Empire. According to this representative who returned to Shanghai, there were three foreigners in the delegation, and the rest were Chinese.</p>
<h3>All Circles in This City Will Publicly Celebrate Yuan's Birthday Tomorrow – Admission by Commemorative Badge</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the sixty-sixth birthday of Chinese Director Yuan Ludeng. The people in the Concession hold Mr. Yuan in high esteem. A public celebration will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Yu Qiaqing Road at 6:00 PM tomorrow. Participation in the celebration is extremely enthusiastic. All participants are requested to collect commemorative badges from the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession at No. 304, 3rd Floor, No. 59 Hong Kong Road, in order to gain admission with the badge.</p>
<h3>Satisfactory Results of Second Phase of Refugee Donations from the Hotel Industry</h3>
<p>The second phase (i.e., December) of the refugee donations collected by the hotel industry has come to a conclusion. A total of 189 hotels collected donations at a rate of 100 people per hotel, raising a total of 23,708.44 yuan in national currency. In addition, 86 small hotels each donated 2 yuan per month, raising a total of 176 yuan in national currency (two hotels collected donations for both November and December), totaling 23,884.44 yuan in national currency. Mr. Xu Wenzhao, a leader in the industry, has always been known for his enthusiasm for public welfare. He organized a fundraising committee to specialize in fundraising affairs. If any members of the industry did not collect donations in accordance with the regulations or did not collect them effectively, Mr. Xu would personally accompany the fundraising committee members and do their best to persuade them. Therefore, the results of the second phase were better than those of the first phase. In addition, there were rumors that some hotels were adding a surcharge of 10% to the bill for refugees. After investigation, it was found that the room rates for the hotel in question were fixed and could not be lowered. There was no surcharge added to the bill. In order to help the refugees, the industry has written to the Refugee Relief Association to clarify the matter and stated that this was not the case.</p>
<h3>Part of the British Garrison in Shanghai Will Return to the Country on Schedule</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, a number of British soldiers selected from the Scottish Fusiliers, the Army Service Corps, and other British Army units stationed in Shanghai will leave Shanghai on the 18th and then board the British troop transport ship Dilwara to return home. The British Military Hospital and the various British Army barracks are scheduled to hold a farewell party on the evening of the 16th of this month. Several of the selected soldiers are well-known athletes.</p>
<h3>Commercial Registration Numbers of Businesses in This City – Economic Gazette Published – Also Published in the Commercial Monthly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued the "Provisional Measures for Commercial Registration in Shanghai" promulgated by the Ministry of Economy. Article 6 states that "After the Shanghai Municipal Government restores its authority, the registration books will be returned to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department for official publication and announcement." Similar to the previous temporary registration, it should not be announced. According to Article 13 of the Commercial Registration Law, it shall not be used to resist bona fide third parties, which is not in line with the purpose of protecting the interests of merchants. After deliberation, the Chamber decided to send a telegram to the Ministry of Economy to request remedial measures. On the 14th of this month, the Ministry of Economy replied by telegram in December stating that it had received the two telegrams and that the temporary commercial registration in Shanghai had been approved by the Ministry and would be published in the Ministry of Economy Gazette and had been submitted to the Executive Yuan for the record. The Chamber informed the various industries and, because the Ministry of Economy Gazette was published in Chongqing and delivery by mail was slow, the Chamber published the registration numbers published in the Gazette in its monthly journal, the Commercial Monthly, to make it public.</p>

<h3>Moore Memorial Church Distributes Food and Clothing</h3>
<p>The Service Committee of the Youth Department of Moore Memorial Church, organized by Mr. Yu Qiaqing, has been visiting alleys and slums every night since the 10th to find poor and helpless refugees. Each person is given a ticket, which can be exchanged for two pounds of hot rice, one piece of clothing, and one salted eggplant. However, those who make a living by begging are not given any assistance. On Sunday afternoons, people go to Moore Memorial Church to redeem their tickets for goods and to be vaccinated against smallpox. The number of men, women, and children is no less than 600.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Taiwanese Sugar Smuggled into Shanghai by the Japanese</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) According to information from our side, there is evidence that a large amount of Taiwanese sugar has been smuggled into Shanghai without paying customs duties. Reporters asked a Japanese spokesman yesterday why there was no record of this in the Customs report if a large amount of Taiwanese sugar was being imported into Shanghai. The spokesman said that the Taiwanese sugar was imported in December, not November. The December statistics have been released by the Customs, but there is no record of Taiwanese sugar imports in them either. The spokesman then said that he could provide a reply on this matter tomorrow.</p>

After the fall of Rugao, he came to Shanghai and established his office at No. 9 Xinle Village, Haining Road (telephone 40369) to continue his practice.</p>

<h3>Mr. Fan Liangbo's Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 41st birthday of the famous Shanghai figure Mr. Fan Liangbo. Considering the chaos of the times, Fan did not want to be extravagant. His students eagerly organized a celebration for their teacher. They rented the Lianhua Nunnery on Qingbeidi Road and arranged a vegetarian feast for the guests. Gifts from relatives and friends were declined. Only contributions from students were accepted. After deducting the expenses for the celebration, the remaining funds were donated to refugee relief organizations to aid the disaster victims. This thoughtful gesture is commendable. Over a thousand guests attended, including Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng. During the banquet, Qingchang performances were provided as entertainment. Mr. Yuan Ludeng opened the performances, followed by famous performers such as Jin Sufei, Yu Sulian, Chen Hefeng, Wang Yaoqin, Zhang Wenqin, Han Sulan, and renowned amateur opera singers such as Zhao Peixin. Everyone enjoyed themselves, and the event was a rare spectacle.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Yesterday, your newspaper published a news item about the sale of morphine at No. 66 Yongyu Lane. To my surprise, the house number listed was that of my residence. I believe that your newspaper values ​​impartiality and requires thorough verification. Publishing without clear evidence is detrimental and may lead to legal issues, affecting the reputation of the residents. Therefore, I request that your newspaper issue a correction and clarification. I also request that the authorities conduct a thorough investigation so that the truth can be revealed. The information published does not match the address of the relevant organization, and it concerns the reputation of the resident. Please investigate and correct. Sincerely, Zhang Residence, No. 66 Yongyu Lane, January 15th.</p>

<h3>Spring and Autumn - Failing! Failing!</h3>
<p>— Lu Jin</p>
<p>Having boasted about "occupying Shanghai in three days and taking Nanjing in ten," the expeditionary force, after a year and a half, is naturally stretched thin. However, the Chinese army is fighting stronger and stronger, and their political views are unified. Even attempts to encourage a puppet to open the door to peace only expose their own fear and baseness—this is called being caught between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>While holding onto such a vast area without being able to advance, and with finances completely exhausted, the only options are to open brothels, sell opium, and have the soldiers engage in labor to extract some money. This so-called "prosperity" "policy" is also the last resort. But amidst scorched earth and rubble, there is no way to "prosper" or extract wealth. Attempts by "clowns" to beckon the Chinese people with "Come, come" are unfortunately met by guerrilla forces, and the resident population suddenly becomes "undesirable elements." The wishful thinking of "numbing the people's minds" and "requisitioning on the spot" is like shooting oneself in the foot—this is called "laughable and absurd."</p>
<p>Now, things have gone a step further. Not only are finances exhausted, but even the army is becoming insufficient. However, there are still many methods being considered: organizing an "Anti-Communist Youth League" and "forcibly conscripting 1.35 million people." This is indeed another ruthless policy of "using Chinese against Chinese." However, whether Chinese youth in guerrilla areas can be easily dispatched, and whether they themselves fear "whether they can trust these armed Chinese," remains questionable—this is called "between a rock and a hard place."</p>
<p>In short, Konoe cannot "protect" the country, and Hiranuma Kiichirō probably cannot "pacify" this great disaster. Even if they loudly proclaim a "long-term war," they will be like someone who has drunk sleeping potion wine, and they will soon see "Failing, failing!"</p>
<h3>The Shame of Humanity</h3>
<p>— Lu Li</p>
<p>The severe winter has arrived. Walking on the street, the cold wind blowing in my face feels like sharp knives cutting my face, ears, and nose… causing stabbing pain. Many homeless refugees are huddled on the sidewalks or in alleys, covering themselves with only a tattered mat. Some don't even have that, shivering in the biting north wind. Whenever I see such scenes, I am always deeply moved and breathless. They are enduring immense suffering for the survival and independence of their country! I shed a few tears. Sadly, my strength is too weak, limited to mere "sympathy."</p>
<p>However, what is heartbreaking is that there are still people sucking the blood of the sufferers, using murderous knives on the suffering, which truly shocks me and makes me lament that "the difference between humans and animals is so small!"</p>
<p>"Shen Zhiguang, the director of the No. 42 Refugee Shelter in Fahua Town, West Shanghai, was originally a refugee in the shelter. Because of recommendations from influential people, he was appointed to this position. Recently, he embezzled the refugees' food and sold it privately for personal gain. Because refugee Zhang Boyuan from Shishan leaked the secret and reported it to higher authorities, Shen had Zhang tortured with private beatings, leaving him covered in wounds. He then threatened to accuse Zhang of defamation and send him to the puppet organization 'Great Way Municipal Government' to face even harsher punishment. Zhang, fearing this, escaped by climbing over the wall but collapsed and died on the way due to the severity of his injuries…"</p>
<p>What a bloody example! Having experienced suffering oneself, one naturally deeply understands the pain. One should strive to improve the lives of the refugees and reduce their suffering. Anyone with a bit of "humanity" would do so. But Shen and others not only remained unmoved but also imposed pressure, threats, slander, and harm, fully exposing their bestiality. Their poisonousness is even worse than snakes and scorpions, hateful and worthy of death! Reading this news, my heart and mind are burned by the flames of anger. Anger makes me mad. I shout loudly, is this the world of humans? Human behavior? I know that the world is full of these demons and monsters with human faces but beastly hearts…</p>
<p>I am not sad, nor do I sigh. I will relentlessly curse, relentlessly scold, and I will even more relentlessly attack, exposing their true faces.</p>
<p>This is the shame of humanity!</p>
<h3>Shanghai Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Hang Qi Master</p>
<p>New World Amusement Park Drum Ballad</p>
<p>Newly Compiled Shanghai New World Amusement Park Narrative Ballad</p>
<p>In Shanghai, timely drum ballads often appear, such as "Xuantong's Second Enthronement" and "Russo-Japanese War Drum Ballad." Whenever a special event occurs, a new drum ballad is sure to emerge. The "New World Amusement Park Drum Ballad" is one such example, with the amusement park life as its subject of song.</p>
<p>This book was created when amusement parks were just starting. "New World" was particularly grand in scale at the time, unlike its current state of decline. The reason why the author sang about "New World" and not "Great World" seems to be mainly this. Regardless of whether it is "New World," "Great World," or other "worlds," we can see the grand scene of the early rise of amusement parks in Shanghai from these thin four volumes, and what we hear is already quite sufficient. This is also the motivation for my discussing this drum ballad.</p>
<p>The book has illustrations in the front, including "Drum Ballad Storytelling," "Cross Talk," "Foreigners Dancing," "Famous Courtesans Giving Up Singing," "Western Magic," "Circus," "Stone Beam Waterfall," "Zishan Hall," "Charlie Chaplin," and "Swinging." The full title of the book is "Newly Compiled Shanghai New World Amusement Park Narrative Ballad," divided into four volumes, with four chapters each. The chapter titles are as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1 Opening the Trend of Establishing Amusement Parks Visiting Shanghai to Investigate New World</p>
<p>Chapter 2 Xu Zhenhua Visits Friend in Hardoon Garden Guan Yaxing Accompanies on Tour of New World</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Commenting on Courtesans and Affectionate Scholars Swinging with Girls Who are Competitive</p>
<p>Chapter 4 Nine Women Bathe Nude in the Milky Way Five People Enjoying a Visit to the Museum</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Walking Through Tunnels to Seek Western Food Enjoying the Artificial Mountain and Appreciating the Waterfall</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Watching the Waterfall Humorous Mockery of Drunkards Listening to Female Opera and Discussing Actors</p>
<p>Chapter 7 Second Play Writing Shadow Play Opening Setting off Fireworks Closing Amusement Activities</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Same Inn Hearing Comments on New World Watching Circus and Occasionally Forming Happy Relationships</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Presenting Martial Arts Brave Warriors Thrust Knives Competing in Skills Beautiful Women Racing Horses</p>
<p>Chapter 10 A Big Meal Good Friends Mocking the Free Hall Where the Rich are Humiliated</p>
<p>Chapter 11 Ugly Men Fooled at the Dance Party Rooftop Theater Westerners Showing Their Skills</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Performing Shadow Plays Watching Detective Stories in Detail Tourists Overwhelmed by Sensual Lyrics</p>
<p>Chapter 13 Second Floor Watching Fireworks Five Friends Entering the Amusement Park Three Times</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Zhu Maichen Cutting Wood Still Studies Hard Wu's Daughter Desperately Wants a Divorce Letter</p>
<p>Chapter 15 Zhu Maichen Passes the Examination and Returns in Glory Wu's Daughter Splashes Water at the Long Pavilion</p>
<p>Chapter 16 Watching the Waterfall Revealing the Underbelly for No Reason Theater Viewing Brocade Ze Map</p>
<p>The whole book uses a tourist as a thread to sing about various amusements in the "New World" and their performance process, which is very detailed. The performers at the time are also described in detail. Each chapter has a poem for the opening, with sayings and singing sentences similar. In terms of writing technique, it is difficult to show its excellence. Published by Jiangdong Maoji Bookstore, stone-printed medium-sized edition, divided into four volumes, and it is not easy to obtain now. However, even in amusement parks, there have been many changes in the past twenty years.</p>
<h3>Shanghai People's Food</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>To begin with, we can say that the people of Shanghai are blessed with good food. As long as you have "money," you can immediately bring whatever you want to eat to your table, whether it's Nanjing salted duck, Beijing candied dates, Sichuan white fungus, or even American oranges and French champagne. Is there anything that cannot be done in Shanghai?</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, eateries from all over the countryside have been forced to relocate or have been destroyed by bombs. As a result, under the limits of manpower and resources, countless numbers have moved to continue operating in the Shanghai concessions. Today, just by looking up, you can easily see a Shanghai branch of Suzhou Caizhiqi here, and a "Kunshan Duck Noodle" snack bar there.</p>
<p>A person living in Shanghai can eat various things non-stop from dawn to midnight every day.</p>
<p>In the morning, Shanghai people rarely eat porridge at home. Wealthy people can, of course, go to a warm teahouse to eat some so-called "breakfast" items. Just ask Da Dong, Da Sanyuan, Guanshengyuan, and other famous teahouses; are they not all "packed with guests" every morning? Barbecue pork buns, chicken buns, e-fu noodles, and milk, toast, coffee… the variety is truly countless, causing anyone who sees them to drool. Secondly, we can see countless heads moving in the pastry shops of Wufangzhai and Wufuzhai. Eating some eel noodles, small meat noodles, soup dumplings, etc. in the morning is indeed very delicious. As for working friends, because they don't have time to cook porridge at home, they also spend a few cents briskly to fill their stomachs every morning. Anyway, there are many stalls selling sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, sticky rice balls, fried tofu vermicelli, soy milk, and tofu pudding on the streets. As soon as they step out the door, it is not difficult for them to quickly finish a "breakfast" and go to work.</p>
<p>At noon, 12 o'clock, everyone must go through the daily "second meal." Naturally, like the "first meal" in the morning, many people go into "magnificent" restaurants to eat a "exquisite" dish costing several yuan, or order something like "shark fin." People in the general office worker class happily gather in groups of three or four to eat an affordable meal in a "restaurant alley," where the price is not high, and the food is not bad. Thirdly, they go to a small restaurant and order a "salted pork tofu soup" or "salted vegetable shredded pork" to eat. Each meal costs no more than 2 mao per person, and the enjoyment they get is not much lower than that of friends who go to big restaurants.</p>
<p>"Three meals a day." Around 6 o'clock in the afternoon is the time for us to have our "third meal." From one point of view, this meal seems to be much lighter than the other two meals. Many families prefer to buy some "deep-fried soybeans," "deep-fried fruit," "pickled radishes," and other things to eat with "tea-soaked rice" at night. Similarly, many people like to eat porridge at night. However, on the other hand, when holding banquets and grand feasts, the evening is still considered the "main event."</p>
<p>Shanghai people can eat "snacks," "tea pastries," etc. from time to time in addition to the three meals. What about "wonton," "dumplings," "pot stickers," "pan-fried buns," "spare rib noodles"? As long as your stomach can handle it, you don't have to worry about not wanting to eat them.</p>
<p>Even in the dead of night, under the hazy moonlight, you will surely still hear someone shouting in the alleys, "Fried rice noodles," "Ham zongzi," "White sugar lotus seed porridge," and "Osmanthus red bean soup." And even more people are broadcasting advertisements for "red bean soup noodles" and "fermented rice balls" on the radio.</p>
<p>Finally, we can say that the people of Shanghai are blessed with good food!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization Guide Jin Talks About Equality</p>
<p>Miss He Liyu said: "Newly built roads are called 'roads.' Old roads, originally named something 'street' or something 'lane,' should still keep their original names. We Chinese have many street and lane names that are extremely elegant, and we don't seem to need to change them." Miss Jin said: "Whether Chinese or foreigners, everyone has a habit: every time there is a reform, they always use the names of a few famous or important people as the names of streets. Although this also expresses the intention to worship heroes, doing it once in a while is fine, but if everything is named like that, it becomes annoying. If we are talking about worshiping heroes, then the world is constantly progressing. Even if we say there are no predecessors, we cannot say there are no successors. After one hero, there will be another hero, so the road name will have to be changed from time to time. According to me, as Liyu-jie said, the former streets and lanes had very elegant names, so it would be better to keep the old names, which is a one-size-fits-all solution." He Liyu said: "Using famous people's surnames as place names and object names is also most common in foreign countries, and Chinese people later followed suit. I heard my great-grandfather say: the first British ship that came to Guangzhou was named 'Confucius.' They thought that we Chinese most respected Confucius, so they named the ship that came to China after the person most respected by the Chinese. Later, as China gradually became westernized, the naming of places after people became even more common." Miss Jin said: "Some places call it 'road' and some places call it 'dao.' We must unify them in terms of names. Right." At this time, Miss Jin's fiancé, Mr. Lin, was busy driving. Hearing this, he turned around and smiled: "Your recent thoughts are all about wanting to unify everything. I think some things certainly need to be unified, but it's okay if some things are not unified." Miss Jin quickly asked: "Why is it better if some things are not unified?" Mr. Lin said: "For example, look at the houses by the roadside. Now, the newly built ones have all kinds of styles, some ancient, some modern, some French, and some German. If everything is unified according to your wishes, then all the houses will be in one style. Where's the interest? Recently, industrialists have been promoting standardization, which I don't really agree with, but it can't be helped in the early days of Chinese industry." It turns out that this Mr. Lin is a construction engineer who studied in France. Many large buildings in China are designed and patterned by him. Although he is only twenty-eight years old, his technology is excellent, and his appearance is handsome. Who doesn't know this young engineer, Mr. Lin Jiancheng? (15)</p>

<h3>Vernacular Opening Remarks</h3>
<p>— Yi Ge</p>
<p>Before beginning a full performance, storytellers in performance halls and on the radio always perform an opening piece. Most of the sentences in the opening piece are ancient poetic lines, and even if the audience has the original text to compare, they will inevitably only have a partial understanding; if there is no original text, and it is sung in the Yu tone, it is simply unintelligible.</p>
<p>Although the opening piece is subordinate to the main performance, it has considerable value in social education. If it can be adapted into vernacular, discarding feudal ideas, and using novel and meaningful themes, singing it like Bai Juyi's poems, which even old women can understand, its effectiveness is undoubtedly above the main performance. Because the opening piece is shorter and can be sung in a few minutes, while the main performance must be performed for at least three or four segments before it can temporarily end. The opening piece is like a cartoon in a movie, or a prelude to a drama. Although it cannot completely satisfy fans, it is definitely not a mere ornament.</p>
<p>Vernacular opening pieces have been written before, incorporating slang and local dialects, which is a rationalization in form, but the content still needs to be improved. I advocate that it should be popular without being vulgar, and each piece should have a clear concept. It must not be like singing a solo performance, with crude words and phrases, merely to elicit a laugh from the audience.</p>
<p>Currently, there are very few vernacular opening pieces, and classical opening pieces are still regarded as rare commodities by storytellers. Some people on radio programs specialize in singing opening pieces, like pouring water from a bottle, singing very quickly, tasting like wax, making them even more meaningless. I hope that people who like to create opening pieces will accept my contribution and create new vernacular opening pieces to supply storytellers to perform.</p>
<h3>Women's Professional Theater Troupe's Debut Performance: Impressions of Women's Apartment</h3>
<p>— Bing Du</p>
<p>In order to attend another social gathering, I did not see the entire play. But in terms of the second half, although it did not have better achievements, it was not so unsuccessful. It should be said that in the depiction of the characters' personalities, Qi Weide, Zhao Guanying, and Niu Dawang all had excellent performances. However, there are a few whose pronunciation or lines were not well prepared. Zhao's mother and others were also quite faithful and very hardworking.</p>
<p>For an amateur performer who has just stepped onto the stage, our hope for it is a bright future. Although "Women's Apartment" cannot surpass "Qingdao," what is valuable is their enthusiasm for theater is very young, and this spirit of bold experimentation is also worthy of respect.</p>
<p>However, it must also be said that in addition to praising and encouraging the "Women's Professional Theater Troupe" itself in principle, we should also actively help it grow and progress. For example, in terms of acting skills, there are inevitably still many awkward and loose areas. However, these shortcomings are the inevitable phenomena when every performer first steps onto the stage. We believe that they will gradually disappear.</p>
<p>The lighting is good, and costumes, props, sound, and makeup do not occupy a large part. The most obvious thing is that the director wants to focus entirely on the performance of the play, but as a result, the development of the play has not reached the expected tightness, and the atmosphere of the whole play feels very sparse. Scenes like the meeting of parents and children and Zhao Zi's departure were not emphasized, but the section where Guanying cries is very wonderful. However, on the whole, for a "Women's Professional Theater Troupe" that has just stepped onto the stage, it is very gratifying to have such achievements. Moreover, Hong Mo's Qi Weide and Zhang Rengzhu's Zhao Guanying are very natural and lifelike. Starting from "Women's Apartment," we hope that the "Women's Professional Theater Troupe" can meet us again with a more advanced posture.</p>
<h3>Silver Train</h3>
<p>Zhou Xuan, on the day "Meng Jiangnu" was completed, specially purchased a Columbia latest radio from Baidai Company, worth several hundred gold, to commemorate the success of this unprecedented starring role. It is said that among female stars' radios, Zhou Xuan's is the most beautiful and well-equipped.</p>
<p>The eiderdown fan held by Yuan Meiyun in her recent work "Young Mistress's Fan" is a small prop from Wu Cun's maiden work "Wind" at Lianhua Second Factory, which caused a sensation at the time. It is also the most noble of the small props in Chinese cinema. Factory director Lu Jie has kept this fan very carefully. It has been cherished extremely well, and it has only recently been seen on the screen again after Zhang Shankun repeatedly borrowed it.</p>
<p>Xu Xinfu and Han Langan held a self-provided car race on Xujiahui Road. When the cars arrived at the Albé Road studio, one of Mr. Xu's car wheels flew off, and Mr. Han's military truck sounded like a coppersmith's load. It can be said that there are no two coincidences that are exactly the same.</p>
<p>Sun Min has been recommended by "Wu Zetian" to Xinhua and will play the leading role in the new films of directors Wan Cang, Xu Xinfu, and Wu Yonggang.</p>
<p>Lu Ming is now acting in "Studio Story" for Yihua. She is also acting in "Red Dust Drifting" for Guohua, making her the busiest actress in recent times for filming contract films.</p>
<p>The theme song of Chen Yunshang's "Hua Mulan" was written by Yan Gongshang and has the same artistic merit as the "Great Sudden Tune" of "Diao Chan."</p>
<h3>The Spoken Drama Movement in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Feng Hua</p>
<p>The cultural level of Northern Jiangsu was not originally very high, but since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the gathering of various talents, the cultural level has increased considerably. For example, in spoken drama, Northern Jiangsu was still an uncultivated virgin land in the past, but now, with the development of the Anti-Japanese War movement, the spoken drama movement has become very vigorous and very common. Famous writers such as Hong Weifa, Pao Yu, and Zhou Xing are now in the new provincial capital (Huaiyin). Since jointly initiating the organization of the Jiangsu Literary Association and the Anti-Japanese War Drama Troupe, they have been performing many shows every day. Following this, many branches have emerged in places like Xinghua, Taizhou, Gao郵, and Bao應. At the same time, Bao Yu has compiled many scripts for local drama troupes to perform. The most famous is the one-act play "Rebirth," which takes the theme of how the Heavenly King Temple Broadsword Society participated in the Anti-Japanese War against Japan. The plot is very moving. He has now created a new four-act play, "No Personal Feuds," published in the "Literary Ten-Day Journal" published by the Literary Association. It writes about a woman who wants to harm a guerrilla leader for revenge but is instead moved and joins the battle herself. The plot is very tortuous. It will be performed by the Anti-Japanese War Drama Troupe at the "People's Theater" in the provincial capital. It is also reported that a spoken drama training class is planned to be established in the shortest possible time to create spoken drama cadres to go deep into the occupied areas to work. If it can be realized, young people who love spoken drama will enthusiastically participate.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City in the Old Capital (7) (7)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Strange Actor Wang Fushou Invariably Gets Booed Every Time He Performs</p>
<p>When Meng Xiaodong, as his "Cinnabar Mole," came on stage, he went to Wu Da Xiang Gong. Unexpectedly, his singing and dialogue were more than twice that of the main character, Han Yuanwai, making it impossible for Xiaodong, who was playing Qingyi, to keep up. The audience listening to the play had never heard of Wu Da Xiang Gong singing like that, and they suspected he was fabricating it. In addition, the children of the Gao family were young and vigorous and wanted to retaliate for the taunt he had said earlier. So, a full house of boos was given, no matter how great your ability to stare with red, green, or five eyes, you were booed off. That day, Qixian (Wang Fushou) really put in a lot of effort, singing and reciting the lines from the play with Gui Fen in the inner court word for word. He never expected that outside, when singing "Cinnabar Mole," the emphasis was only on Han Yuanwai and Wu Da Niangzi, and the role of Wu Da Xiang Gong was entirely filled by a perfunctory old man. He was a sincere person, with no sense of occasion, and didn't know how to adapt to the times, which led to this embarrassing situation. The reason was that his singing was too sophisticated for the general public, but if he hadn't caused trouble with his bad mouth, he wouldn't have been opposed by both the front and back stages. He only sang for one day with the Gao family's troupe and was dismissed. On another occasion, someone introduced him to a certain troupe. When he entered the backstage and looked at the names on the wooden plaque on the wall, he immediately grabbed a spear, used the spearhead to destroy all the names, broke the spear into several pieces, and exclaimed: "There is simply no one in this group who can sing!" After saying that, he turned around and left, making the introducer go crazy with anger.</p>
<p>Above, it was said that he had committed a great act of disrespect in front of the Empress Dowager in the palace. Why was he only punished by kneeling? And afterwards, Wei Bubao not only did not argue with him but instead kowtowed to him and softly pleaded with him. Could it be that Red Eyes Four (Wang Fushou) really had some unique skills? But then again, he really had some tricks up his sleeve. When it came to martial arts, he could sing "The Four Heroes Village" and somersault more than two people high. He was even more skilled than Gao Xueqiao, a famous martial arts actor who was known for being able to somersault over a cloth city and therefore looked down on everyone else. When it came to long-bearded plays, he knew all the ones that the old Yu could perform. One day, the palace scheduled "Tianshui Pass" starring Da Tou (Wang Guichen), but Wang Guichen had to take leave due to an emergency. Wang Si (Wang Fushou) played Kongming on stage and was able to satisfy the Empress Dowager. Da Tou used high-pitched singing in some places, and he could also sing it the same way.</p>
<h3>"Meng Jiangnü" Filming Completed</h3>
<p>The well-known story of "Meng Jiangnü" has now been made into a movie by Guohua Film Company. The entire film is antique in style, and the scenery is grand, such as the Great Wall and the Qin Dynasty palaces, all of which spared no expense in pursuing common truth, beauty, and goodness. The film was written and directed by Wu Cun, and the old drama has been refined in a new way, making the meaning clearer, and the director's delicacy is even more special. Ms. Zhou Xuan plays Meng Jiangnü, and her image is suitable. The two songs she sings, "Hundred Flowers Song" and "Spring Flowers Like Brocade," are pleasing to the ear. The male lead is played by Xu Feng. This gentleman was the first-place student admitted to the Mingxing Performing Arts Training Institute. The film was produced by Mingxing Film Company, and the entire film is accompanied by national music and will be released at the Jincheng Grand Theater soon.</p>
<h3>Chess Garden Seventh Game Endgame Summary Red to Move and Win</h3>
<p>— Edited by Bao Zibo, Revised by Lu Chengzhai</p>
<p>Endgames are roughly divided into two types. The chess formations published in the manuals are generally fabricated and cannot be derived from a full game. The "Endgame Summary" published in this garden is commonly seen in games and is necessary for practical use. It can be regarded as essential knowledge. For example, everyone knows that this game is a win for Red, but they don't know why it's a win because they don't understand the moves. In the past, the famous player Wan Qiyou played against Lei Haishan at the Simeixuan Chess Club. Mr. Wan held a chariot and pawn, while Mr. Lei held a chariot, soldier, and complete advisors and elephants. At that time, they went back and forth for three hours, and Mr. Lei ultimately had no way to win. Mr. Wan was able to achieve a lucky draw, which shows that this game is not easy.</p>
<p>Yesterday's comparable moves Pawn 4 advances 1 Advisor 5 retreats 6 Pawn 7 moves sideways to 6 General 5 advances 1 Cannon 1 moves sideways to 5 Elephant 5 advances to 7 Cannon 5 retreats 4 Chariot 3 moves sideways to 5 Advisor 5 retreats 3 Cannon 8 moves sideways to 5 Cannon 5 advances 2 times Chariot 2 moves sideways to 5 Cannon 5 advances 2 times Elephant 7 retreats 5 Cannon 5 advances 2 times</p>
