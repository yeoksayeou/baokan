<p>倫敦　據今日此間消息、英國仍圖拉攏蘇聯、昨晚蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基曾與英外相海立法克斯晤談、解答英方於星期六所提出之各問題、聞上决大戰時首相勞合喬治、將被派往莫斯科、充英國特使、商務大臣史丹萊亦將隨行、據此間蘇聯方面表示、蘇聯準備與英國開始商務談判、（二十八日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英國政府昨向蘇聯提議、就兩國商務經濟問題、重行開始談話、頃據此間消息靈通人士談稱、蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基業於本日午後向哈里法克斯外相提出肯定的答案、但謂、英國政府必須準備以商業信用放款畀予蘇聯、並應允蘇聯以大量貨物輸往英國、此間外交界人士以爲、蘇聯政府此種態度、乃因穗國外長里賓特洛浦正在莫斯科與蘇聯常局進行談話之故、據聞里賓特洛浦一方欲使土耳其與英法兩國相疏遠、一方擬向蘇聯提議共同採取「和平攻勢」、俾於和平實現之日、將歐洲一切政治問題、一切「不可容忍」之領土問題、通盤加以檢討、西歐各民治國、若果拒絕和議、則當慫患蘇聯與穗國合作、而以贊助蘇聯對於羅馬尼亞國貝薩拉比亞省之要求爲報酬、同時並將波羅的海沿岸各國、劃爲德蘇兩國勢力範圍、覜於里賓特洛浦此種活動、宜乎蘇聯對於英蘇經齊淡話之議、附以種種條件矣、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦　德外長里賓特羅甫與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫將於今日下午賡續談判世界各國常局，因談話內容尙未發表、故對之紛起揣測、巴黎官方認爲蘇聯現正要求德方對於波羅的海方面、作重大之犧牲、以作蘇聯繼續保守中立之代價、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　德國外長里賓特洛浦頃於本日午後二時、率同該國駐蘇聯大使施蘭堡、再度會晤外交人民委員長莫洛托夫、此外、愛沙尼亞外長塞爾特即當與蘇聯當局進行談話、外間盛傳、蘇聯當與愛沙尼亞訂立軍事同盟條的云、（二十八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>莫斯科　愛沙尼亞外長塞爾特、頃於午後六時、搭乘瑞典國航郵機抵達此間、其時適在穗國外畏里賓特洛浦抵此十數分鐘之後、與塞爾特外長同行者、有該國駐蘇公使雷奧古斯特衆議院議長烏洛資·國際公法專家沛普斯敎授·曁蘇聯駐愛沙尼亞國公使尼基丁、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>愛沙尼亞京城　蘇聯所提要求內容如何、此間政府當局諱莫如深、官方僅謂、「此事正由政府曁衆議院外交委員會縝密研究、」政府並於今晨發表簡短公報、謂外交部長塞爾特率同法理外交專家若干人業巳再度前往莫斯科、與蘇聯當局進行談話云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>芬蘭京城　據此間可靠方面今日觀察、蘇聯若能佔領軍事上極關重要之愛沙尼亞各島嶼、至少必能暫時滿意、唯目前之愛沙尼亞政府、在蘇聯方面並不視爲十分友好、故爲增進兩國國交計、或將要求改組愛沙尼亞政府、亦屬可能、目前愛沙尼亞各報及各無綫電廣播電台、皆對蘇聯採取沉默態度、惟蘇聯方面、則已開始其反宜傳、蘇聯海軍、亦結隊巡行於愛沙尼亞之沿海一帶、（二十八日美聯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>贛湘戰事</h3>
<p>舉世視綫集中於國際大局之紛擾幻變，於今旣逾匝月；即在中國，方事抗戰，痛癢切膚，但默察一般意念，亦不免遐騖於國際；此非和平不可分，世事動盪失其重心之徵歟？</p>
<p>以吾人觀感，侵略種子，播自遠束；徒以若干國族，儼然負有左右世變之重任者，志行薄弱，姑息荀安，遂使凶燄張揚，樹爲風氣；養癰當初，噬臍今日。捷克犧牲於樽俎之間，輕描淡寫，詎非和平傑作，似乎消弭禍患自有術焉；終至劍拔弩張，雖驅數百萬生靈以保障波蘭，曾無以解波蘭瓦解之厄。演進而至昨今，大局愈壞；試問愛沙尼亞之國運，明日如何，操之誰手？羅馬尼亞之國運，後日如何，操之誰手？北歐中歐東南歐其他諸小國之國運將如何，又操之誰手？暴力橫決，秩序蕩然，愛羅諸國以决但禱天佑，但願宰割者刀下留情耳，豈有術以自存哉！回念八九年前，日內瓦冠蓋如雲，濟濟蹌蹌，集賢豪雋彥高談闊論天下事，視瀋陽星火如無物，今則惟有視鐵血爲最高權威矣。鐵血相搏，以其勝敗註定運命；而當前不可知之岐途，乃在各個運命將俟整個世界之鐵血較量而總解決歟，抑將由各個較量，以决底定，以迄於整個世界之和平歟？由前之說，期待戰局延擴，彼捷克波蘭惟有作如是想；由後之說，應各自掙扎於其局部戰爭之中。如中日戰爭者，倘歐戰延擴而爲世界戰爭，則中日不能自外於總解決，蓋大局大勢，不可抗也；不然，遠東之重心固猶繫於中日，若乃意念遐騖者，誤也。</p>
<p>中日戰爭至今閱二十七月，大小戰不可以數計，最近三五月無大戰；及最近一週，驟見活潑。日軍大舉於湖南，顯然以長沙爲目標；華軍反攻於江西，旣所以解除湖南側面之威脅，亦所以搖撼日軍西上之途徑。按之戰訊，湖南日軍稍前進，而華軍在江西，數日之問克復軍略要點極多，殲滅日軍允衆。原中日戰爭之中，不以尺土寸地之進退得失爲重，是則盡人知之；然雙方今日所表演者，則於軍事意義而外，允別有應予往意焉。其一，中日戰綫自山西迄廣東，，殊未許別其重輕；然三五月來之情况，日軍經營山西，覬覦陝西，其跡象甚爲明顯；今乃攻湘而不進窺陝，雖得以經營山西未能逞志爲之解釋，然在蘇日簽訂停止敵對協定之後，以軍事言，日方固不難自東北方面，調集重兵，脅迫晋陝，以遂其深入陝西遮斷中國西北交通之圖；舍此不圖，非於軍事外，另有政治外交爲之原因乎？此一疑問，不容臆測；然今後將此疑問與蘇日關係參酌研求之，或能有所發見也。其二，華軍扼守長沙，能如何持久，將索何代價，茲猶未可逆覩；以日方陸空兩軍之力量，攻陷長沙，自非異事；况日軍主力在湘，華軍在戰略上亦決不以主力與之周旋，則他日長沙而竟陷於日軍，允不必以意外視之。然此决華軍在江西方面之收穫，至少亦爲最近三月以來所未有；此所表見者，華軍抗戰之士氣與力量，經二十七月而至少猶能保持其强毅。日軍愈西進而戰綫愈長愈單薄，亦即遭受華軍反攻之機會愈多，暴露其弱點愈甚。華軍發揮其强毅，日軍暴露其弱點，此所影響於當前　內外之人心者，視物質之得喪，允有重大價値。其三，中日戰爭之中，有一意外之現象；即在中國國內，實際從事於抗戰，出死入生之將領士兵，意氣旺盛，而對於抗戰發生意識上之動搖者，非將領士兵也，今日贛戰可爲一證；在國際，中國迄今表示不妥協，而號稱同情於中國抗戰，且與中國抗戰同其密切利害之友邦，輒事妥協，自歐戰爆發後，妥協傾嚮允著。凡此現象，在事實上不足以左右中國之抗戰，由此現象而產生之種種空中樓閣、或足以影響及於國際視聽，使動盪中之國際大局增加一層迷惑之序慕。近日湘贛劇戰，則得以事實說明中國在繼續抗戰之中途，說明中國有繼續抗戰之力量，亦即消除國際迷惑之要着。</p>
<p>中國而放棄抗戰，祇能爲日本解決中國問題，中國而決心抗戰，必爲中日平等解決中日問題之重要基礎。萬一一切問題併爲世界問題而有待總解決，則不戰而亡之捷克，戰而瓦解之波蘭，在總解決中有無地位，乃爲絕大疑問；而中國則必以繼續抗戰而在總解決中保持優越之地位。蘇聯之遣兵入波蘭焉，昭吿世人日，不料波蘭潰敗若是之速，竟爾不國也；夫如此云云，不足爲訓，然亦可爲繼續抗戰增一註解矣。</p>

<p>柏林　關於英海相邱吉爾之報售謂、穗國飛機轟炸北海中之英國軍艦從未命中、反被擊落三架云云、穗國空軍總司令戈林上將、當即發表公吿加以駁斥、略稱、英國航空母艦一艘會被擊中五百公斤之炸彈一枚、主力艦一艘、曾被擊中二百五十公斤之炸彈二枚、擊中前部及中部、此項炸彈之損毀能力、固可不言而喩、投彈之穗國飛機、均未爲英艦所擊中、全部安然飛回根據地、（二十七日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　德國空軍發言人宜稱、德空軍在北海上轟炸英國軍艦、應視爲具有主要意義、因空軍雖曾襲擊潛艇、而轟炸軍艦、尙係第一决也、英國飛機於戰事初期、企圖襲擊德國海軍根據地、損失飛機的百分之五十、故德空軍在北海上炸傷英國主力艦一艘、炸毀航空母艦一艘、寶爲軍事史軍艦被飛機轟炸之第一决記錄云、據海軍專家指稱英國僅有航空母艦六艘、及水上飛機母艦二艘、而「勇敢一號已被德潛艇擊沉、德國飛機亦擊沉英國飛機母艦一艘、目前復炸沉一艘、實爲英國之重大損失也、（二十八日海通電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據今日官方聲稱、星期二、襲擊北海英艦隊之德轟炸機、曾利用低垂之雲層、掠過英國戰艦、其他飛機之飛行於一萬二千尺以上者、亦有時利用雲層之裂罅處攻擊英國之巡洋艦、但因英艦隊之防禦十分有效、致德機不能尋獲目標、當時英艦隊正在掩護一稍有損毀駛回英國之英潛艇、穗機即乘此機會作無效之攻擊、結果德機被擊落二架、至少尙有一架、亦受重創、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<p>港方塞出沙遜進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均平、紐的銀價共縮二分、倫敦生金未定、匯兌英對美。對滬。對法均平、美對英長六二五、對滬升一角、對法大一分、以上均係假前軋過、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士二八一二五、美匯七元一二五、較週一英平美鬆〇三一二五、乃匯兌上漲之故、開後華商錢兌業等雖有買進頭寸、但外行華北有利某行等頗有賣胃、故市勢極形穩定、計華北某行售予華商錢兌業等現貨美匯七元一二五及一八七五、滙豐掛脾揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後西商沙遜略有扒進、但外行尙有供意、致未蒙影響、計沙遜結進荷蘭。華北。有利等外行現貨英金四辦士三一二五、並現貨美匯七元一八七五及一二五、旋以華商紗花帮突來了結——月份美滙、兼外電香港等亦　　塞、故情况遂略帶硬、計紗　帮吐予大通本月份美滙七元二一八七五及二五、繼之港電等塞予華北某行等外行現貨英金四辦士三一二五及三四三七五、兼現貨美滙七元二五及二八一二五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價英金四辦士三一二五、美滙七元二一八七五、比晨開英鬆〇三一二五、美硬〇九三七五</p>
<p>美匯掉期更拔開</p>

<h3>外幣漲多跌少</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、　疲不一、英美金票隨滙市繼續趨鬆、前者計跌五角、爲五十一元半、美金票初做十四元二角半、嗣忽步退至十四元一角半、最後又升至十四元一角七分、結果仍小一角三分、英金鎊則隨金價微漲五角、法郎票亦升一分、新加坡票昂三分、荷蘭票騰四角、日金票大二厘爲一元三角四分四、朝鮮票漲五厘、價爲一元一角八分、其餘各幣均無變動、</p>

<h3>金價與外匯背馳　港帮力吸黃金　成交有三千兩</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、雖外滙穩中兼帶硬化、但金價則背馳上漲、惟當日伸縮力已不若假前之强、蓋以某金號逢高求售、（聞乃轉套外滙）而香港帮因該地金價較滬市金價高起四白元光景、故亦乘低力吸、（開全日收貨爲數頗鉅）昨日大致趨勢、初略疲、繼堅穩、而後盤旋、晨開爲四千〇九十五元低價後、經某錢兌業代港帮猛吸、午刻曾盤高至四千一百四十七元高峯、午後初開因某現金舖猛塞、竟撳小至四千一百十元、後港帮又拉提至四千一百四十五元、入後某金號再撳低至四千一百十五元、惟結果以四千一百二十三元收盤、較假前續漲十八元、收後趨勢因港帮再度吸收、又抬高至四千一百三十元邊境、全天交易暢旺、約三千兩左右、銀樓飾金掛高五元、海關金等仍均呆定無變、</p>
<p>烚赤所漲甚微</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初闢因聞外滙略硬、局勢似稍帶疲、開市較週一晚收做低十元、某金號賣予錢兌業五十兩、爲四千〇九十五元、開後香港帮買意殷濃、委託某錢兌業力進、兼另一錢兌業與某現金號亦代客方吸收、市勢頓轉向榮、不久即抬起五十元、錢兌業進銀樓帮三十兩、爲四千一百四十五元、旋以外滙趨鬆、客帮辦胃頓轉呆滯、加之某金號與銀樓帮賣意殷切、回落三十五元、某令號售予錢兌業十兩、爲四千一百十元、此後證券帮忽來猛吸、而錢兌業等亦從事收進、跌風頓挫、復漲三十七元、錢兌業互做五十兩、爲四千一百四十七元、將近午刻、某金號又來拋塞、形勢略轉下疲、未幾回落七元、某金號吐予錢兌業十兩、爲四千一百四十允、作午收價、午後初開因某現金舖賣意頗濃、加之缺乏維持、開市竟猛撳三十元、某現金號賣予錢兌業三十兩、爲四千一百十元、開後某錢兌業復代港帮力吸、雖某現金號仍有賣胃、但頭寸仍難相敵、不久即回高三十五元、錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千一百四十五元時某金號忽重興賣風、趁高力塞不懈、竟再降落三十元、錢兌業　予某銀號二十兩、爲盼千一百十五元、入後某錢兌業再來拉提、遂被抬高八元、某錢兌　進余號證券帮共五十兩、爲四千一百二十三元作晚收價、結果比假前軋漲十八元、聞收後某錢兌業又進金號等五十兩、爲四千一百二十八元、全天五十二元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十元、收進須减低三十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>

<h3>證劵　內債略疲　外股買氣旺盛</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、經過秋節休假後、昨已照常開做、湘中戰事激烈、歐戰又絕無休止之望、市塲人氣、缺乏興奮、大戶多頭、緩緩塞出、惟犬部份尙在擯持中、市價乃漸漸下降、昨日開做、市價即因賣戶擁擠而疲、後以大戶亦在求售、丙種打破五元關、丁戊種亦破四元關、三十八號始終賣出、興元永康及大豐均有相當數量脫手、買戶祇鴻康聯和稍有進胃、益中亦有買進、市價結果、小七角至八角半、成交總數共計的五十萬元左右、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票、華商證劵股、成交四十股、價二十五元五角、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報吿云、昨股市甚形激昂、各種實業股買氣奇旺、船務業公司方面之股漲風允烈、上騰中各股顯著者有如下述、耶松股一百二十五元、漲十三元、瑞鎔股九元五角、漲九角半、會穗豐股三十九元半、漲二元一角半、鋼業股十元一角、漲八角、開平股四十元、漲一角、中國墾殖股六元九角、漲四角、怡和紗廠股十九元七角、漲六角、雖然、此種漲風之來、顯無特殊理由、可資遵循、橡皮股較爲沉寂、價則堅穩、近收盤時、因有獲利了結、各股價格、稍有回頭、</p>
<p>倫敦二十七日電、今日遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、銀行股又吿跌落、麥加利銀行股跌五先令、爲六鎊五先令、滙豐銀行股、各跌一鎊、價爲七十二鎊、其餘平定、</p>
<p>倫敦二十七日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍開中法美金等數種、行情平穩無變動、</p>
<h3>怕而買太橡皮　—將派中期股息—</h3>
<p>本埠德康洋行經理之怕而買太橡皮有限公司、昨經董事會議決定於十月六日起開派截至一九三九年十月底止一年度之中期股息、每股國幣四分、</p>
<h3>紗花　旺令已屆　投機改購精紗　十支漲十至念元　念支反跌五六元</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、趨勢頗呈徘徊之象、實際交易太少、人心尙堅挺、因原棉不鬆、廠方成本有關、亦不願意遷就開出、於是遂成擯持局面、惟十支粗紗市態轉趨高翔、成交又形增繁、實則價値較二十支紗爲廉、一般經營者與其購進細紗做心思、不如搜羅粗紗爲佳、風險旣輕、而時令尙在旺檔之際、獲利希望比較爲大、此種情况、早誌本報、因此本日細紗雖則疲憊、而粗紗反見上升、就此狀况、二十支與十支紗之差價、當有軋攏一步之望也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、同業相聚大衆　望不動、因實需交易無採辦舉動、故遲緩至九時五十分尙未做開行盤、惟十支粗紗、津帮有交易，進幾包、售價高昂、旋以二十支雙馬棧單開價平平、現貨反見下挫、中途盤頭甚微、惟客銷仍未見起色、迨至收盤仍平庸、查半日成交一千八百四十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌五元、天女跌六元、雙地球跌六元、惟十支粗紗漲十元至二十元、永安廠開出十支特金城七百包、價爲六百五十元、當日墊銀、茲將各帮口買去之額量如左、</p>
<p>香港　五六〇　同行　九〇五</p>
<p>內地　三六〇　寗波　一〇</p>
<p>廈門　一〇　統計一、八四五</p>
<h3>本棉廠辦轉健</h3>
<p>棉花交易頗爲進展、華廠申新·永安·德豐等廠、紛紛活動採辦興繁、因此市價異常堅挺、且有上漲之勢、實則各路來源艱雞、茲據四鄉函訊、鄉間籽花價目、亦已提高、近來十支粗紗價昂、廠方補進原料較衆、故平果爾來買印棉需要亦增進、蘇北來源、計通州花一千零六十五包、草包花八百二十五包、共計兩日到頭、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來較形呆滯、然價格始終殊爲堅定、廠方進意日來殊呈淡薄、而同　間對於售價一項殊不因此而略形放鬆也、同業間均以市上存底日形乾枯、故凡金融較裕者、非唯不願售出、反乘機購藏之、故大衆意見、將於十月初旬、交易可能轉盛云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初較爲靜寂、首因同業略有交易、現貨交易亦略見旺盛、並引起一部份之空頭抵補、市况頗爲堅定、收盤價格較之上日漲起七八鎊音、印度連同預測漲二羅比、埃及棉市漲起三十餘鎊音、利物浦跌九辦十、</p>
<h3>糧食　薄稻見新　杜米又增一二元</h3>
<p>杜米邇　來各地新貨逐步上市、若崑蘇新粳、上市已將一旬、惟以到埠不夥、粳市非惟未受影響、反以缺貨昂貴、昨在破粳高漲聲中、新薄稻亦見上市、計到楓涇百哥稻六十包、且以今庚風調雨順、米品殊佳、故備受店方歡迎、價開原包四—包、其餘各粳、河下貨在途聞有三十餘艘、但後竟改送浦東及虹口區、故本埠所到、僅有車運包子蘇崑楓嘉等各區新貨三千餘包、客販喊聲又高、進戶亦以應需孔亟、競相搜購、一時形勢緊俏、行情步升、結果竟較節前收盤、又增一二元不等、各尖市面、人心隨之堅昂、而本街及鄉莊、以秋節停市一天後、均有添購、價遂好起二三角、午刻以到貨較夥、日商乘機更將大批蕪尖推出、致市上籌碼充盈、形成供過於求、市面回跌、收盤若陳新各尖、悉較節前反落半元左右、計統市做開特常破粳四十二元、中三十八元、特錫破粳四十一元、高四十元、中市三十八元、蘇同崑破粳三十八元、新粳三十七元、河下陳早晚稻三十八元至三十元、原包四十元至三十八元、楓涇百哥四十元、蘇崑楓嘉新羊尖特別二十六元半、大市二十六元、决之二十五元、蘆尖二十六元至二十五元、江北新尖二十四元、决之二十三元、蕪湖特尖二十四元半、市二十四元至二十三元半、决之二十二元、陳尖二十三元至二十二元八角、變元亦好半元、本糯三十四五元、香港糯三十四元至三十三元半、成交數共計八千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈　晨市被粳米騰漲影響、市面一度見俏、旋以輪遝到頭不絕、而日商續有整批三四千包拋出、市面立即下遊、結果反比節前小去四五角、高客秈開二十四元左右、中决二十三二元不等、統市成交的有五千包云、</p>
<h3>兵船粉實鎖繁旺　比礮車加起一角</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日交易、尙稱活潑、因値中秋節後開市之期、客銷較前略形鬧熱、允以兵船粉走銷最爲普遍、除北洋帮添辦外、本街及內地需要亦不寂寞、且近日香港。厦門等處其他雜牌粉出口亦屬不少、市面本有扣緊之象、奈目下各廠存粉充足、囤戶售求者亦衆、故廠盤爲七元原盤、回籠貨仍爲七元零五分至七元一角四五分、聞兵船脾蛟礮車牌巳加起一角左右云、今日出口麵粉有五萬四千一百包運天津、父四千包運香港、小麥前昨來源、依然不絕、到貨仍以京蕪常錫等麥爲大宗、各廠近以存粉充足、原料需要不貪、貨方以產價不鬆、未肯過於遷就、結果無甚榮辱、統市由廠家辦去一萬餘包、及囤戶拉進七八車、管店麥最高價十元零二角三分、比前略緊、　次各麥售廠貨、價與前開相仿、</p>

<h3>疋頭　本街暢辦國布　靑島細布已無來貨　布國</h3>
<p>咋布市堅昂、乃緣東疋市盤提高、本街染色用途、改辦國布、故本街採購最健、細布。細斜成交一千餘包、售價每疋漲二角半至五角、粗布晨市平平、後市每疋轉漲二角、惟粗斜以實銷萎頓、最乏生氣、客路川。滇帮以滇越交通阻斯、各貨停辦、色布。綫呢行銷頗受影響、市面已轉平定、不若白貨俏利、本街囤戶以細紗錢昂貴、故對淺色貨府綢。條漂布，漂布。細紗綫、坯布搜囤心思頗爲熱烈、</p>
<p>東疋</p>

<h3>五金　扁鐵價昂</h3>
<p>扁鐵市况、已久吿岑寂、客帮銷路呆滯、而本街採辦亦屬零星、然存貨無多、且該貨之出產地爲英國比利時及德國等、因忙於戰爭、無暇運貨、海外來源因之吿斷、木埠喊價日增、刻市如二吩每市担售四十元、三吩售三十八元、叫吩喊價則在三十七元左右、查已比前漲起十餘元之巨矣、</p>

<h3>中央銀行　分幣券今日發行　托烟兌業轉發不另設櫃　今日正午卽可流通巿面</h3>
<p>各業臨時代價劵應限期一律收回</p>
<p>中央銀行奉財政部令、發行一分·五分·分幣券後、委托美商永寗公司承印、首批五十萬元、業巳印竣、本擬於八月二十二日發行、旋因市上發現未蓋章無號碼之樣張、該行爲鄭重起見、暫緩發行、並向承印者交涉澈查遺漏在外原因、今巳查明遺漏在外樣張爲數不多、爲救濟市面　利各業零找計、決定於今日起、由上海分行公吿發行、委托烟兌業公會轉發各該會員等兌換、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>中央銀行　公告發行</p>
<p>中央銀行上海分行公吿云、「本行茲發行五分券一種、正反面均藍色、一分券一種、正反面均紅色、兩種正面印有地紋、反面印有號碼及圖章、即日行使、並由本行委托烟兌業公會轉發各該會員等兌換、本行並不設櫃兌換、特此公吿、中華民國二十八年、九月二十九日」、</p>
<p>委托烟兌　公會兌換</p>
<p>首批分幣券計一分三十萬元、五分二十萬元、歸中央銀行上海分行發行、已由該行發行局與上海市烟兌業同業公會商妥、委托該會轉發各烟兌店兌換、該行决定不另設兌換櫃、望各業勿前往該行兌換、至於各銀行錢莊之兌換、得山銀行汲錢業準備會庫向該行換取</p>
<p>邀集同業　備款掉取</p>
<p>烟兌業公會昨派市塲委員章士彬·沈實鶴·備函赴中央銀行接洽領取分幣券、茲錄其函云、「逕啟者、上月會奉一函、敝同業預定分幣券一事、今午蒙貴行電話通知、分幣券將屆發行、囑敝同業備款掉換、當經召集敝同業交款、向貴行更換、今已集成款項、特備函並派員前來面洽、至希延洽、該分幣券祈交原人携轉爲荷、」昨已由會員九十四家備款三萬四千七百元、向中央銀行掉換分幣券、</p>
<p>十足準備　兌現辦法</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向中央銀行探悉、分幣券凖備金係以法幣爲十足凖備、凡持分幣券五分二十張或一分一百張者、可向該行發行局兌現法幣一元、首批五十萬元、完全在上海發行流通市面、將來視市面需要再行續印、該行上海分行昨晚已將定期發行及委托烟兌業公會轉發情形、電重慶總行報吿、並將分幣券式樣送總行呈財政部備查、</p>
<p>今晨發行　流通滬巿</p>
<p>該項分幣劵五十萬元、由美商永寗公司印竣、昨晚已依照承印合同規定、如數解繳於中央銀行上海分行、由該行發行局派員點牧、準今日上午九時開箱發行、並與烟兌業公會市塲委員章士彬等洽妥、定今晨十時前往領取、今日上午十一時起、由烟兌業公會分發與各會員、芷午起即可流通市面、</p>
<p>各業代價　券應收回</p>
<p>本市各業爲應付零幣缺乏、解除尾找困難、除使用郵蔡及印花外、各商號公司並多自發代價券、以資流通、因奸宄之偽造混用、致代價券信用失墜、使用時爭執時起、今中央銀行滬行旣奉令正式發行分幣券，代價券原爲一時權宜之計、自應公吿限期收回、以重國家幣制、至兩租界電車公司及公共汽車公司所發之臨時分幣劵、均應依照限期、一律收回、</p>
<h3>泥城附近日偽軍　大受威脅　顧部四出截擊　大團日軍撤離</h3>
<p>浦東忠議救國軍第四支隊特務大隊隊長顧立峰部下、大多係商團團員、及受過相當訓練之靑年、自日偽軍佔據大團後、顧部散伏鄕間、運用流動戰略、繼續奮鬥、始終不渝、如近海之泥城地方、</p>
<p>日偽千餘</p>
<p>欲爲搜索工作、時被顧部於深夜四出截擊、待日偽軍追踵前往、顧部已飄然四散、週圍多是蕩田蘆葦、已影跡無蹤、日偽軍祗向蘆葦中無的亂放、白天再向葦叢細查、亦一無所獲、一連三日、日偽軍受不過威脅、</p>
<p>退回大團</p>
<p>忽於二十五日晚、日偽軍又分作五隊、向泥城及該地左面之蟛鎭、右面之新鎮進發、不意行至中途、已爲顧部所悉、急遣部隊預伏在陳家店（，離新鎭尙差八華里）相近要道中、待日偽軍一部份二百餘人經過、即四面包圍截擊、機槍聲與步槍聲密如聯珠、時在深夜、日偽軍不知游擊隊之多少、急放</p>
<p>信號求救</p>
<p>待左路之日偽軍趕到、時已天明、顧部亦已撤退、該軍雖就近一二里內向民間搜查、但一無所獲、聞是役日偽傷亡十餘人、顧部傷區隊長郭宗强一人、現巳送至安全地帶治療、叉傷隊士四名、現據當日來人談、日偽軍尙在搜索、未回大團</p>
<h3>日偽統制蔬菜　地貨業表示反對　如果見諸實現影響必大　將集議以有效方法對付</h3>
<p>關於偽「市府」擬在北蘇州路四行倉庫舊址、設「上海蔬菜市塲」、俾完成日方統制兩租界主要食料之企圖、大中社記者、昨曾以此消息詢諸地貨業領袖某君、據談、此項傳說、早有所聞、惟登記辦法及</p>
<p>詳細章程</p>
<p>地貨業尙未接到任何方面口頭或書面通知、惟信此種計劃、必有奸人因貪圖一己私利、從中助紂爲虐、盼其實行、地貨業方面、昨晨曾派人至新垃圾橋畔四行倉庫視察、除該倉庫門首、仍有日憲兵及偽警駐守外、並未見</p>
<p>任何異狀</p>
<p>又派人向虹口地貨業探詢亦稱不悉此事、惟此項統制如果實現、對租界地貨業影響必大、如果一旦見諸實現、自當集議以有效之方法對付之、某君又稱、現市塲蔬菜以</p>
<p>來源不暢</p>
<p>價格逐步提高、實已使平民無力購買、設遭統制、則將更難負擔、自可斷言也、連日由浦東運至老閘橋之蔬菜、經過二白渡橋時、亦常有攔截菜船、通令向虹口蔬菜市塲出售之舉</p>
<h3>由甬轉口來滬土產概須先結外匯　各業向部呈請救濟　甬貨運滬勢將激减</h3>
<p>寗波浙海關奉財政部電令、對由甬轉口來滬土產、不論何種貨物、槪須先結外匯、否則拒絕報關、緣是自甬待運來滬貨物、囤積頗多、不克起裝、此事現雖由寗波各業向財政部請求救濟、惟在未指示有變通辦法前、自甬裝滬貨運、將大爲减少矣、</p>
<p>縮短航程　又有阻碍</p>
<p>客貨方面各輪當局雖有盡量减少貨運、多載搭客之意、惟本班禮和洋行船務部謀福輸、乘裝甬貨尙未起卸前、抽暇返滬一趟、俾資載客重行駛鎭、如此則急待返甬旅客、得早日登程、而輪方得節省在鎭海口外無謂逗留時間、茲因故未獲實現、決待在鎮將貨起卸後返滬、原定十月一日開鎭計劃、業巳作罷、</p>
<p>最先開駛　滬甬航輪</p>
<p>中意公司德平輪、巳於前日抵滬、該輪原定二十九日午後四時開鎭、茲以謀福展期返滬、以致待裝該輪貨物益湧、裝載需時、故該輸已展期於三十日午後四時啟椗駛鎮、此後自鎭首先返滬者、則爲海福、</p>
<h3>第二次平糶　決定緩辦　定期召集各團體　結束首决平糶事</h3>
<p>上海市米號業同業公會此决經辦各團體貢米八千包平糶、兩租界共分五處、業於本月二十五日先後結束、茲全部移交均已辦妥、除各處平糶米票及糶出貢米石數、業已决第發表、米號業公會於昨日下午三時、在山海關路會所召開第十六决執監聯席會議、計到張念萱·陸文韶·瞿振華·潘紀斌·史鴻勳·黃如園·夏同福·陳少廉·萬培源·陳良麒·江秋聲等二十餘人、主席張念萱、首由主席報告開會宗旨、及會務狀况、旋即由各平糶處主任分別報吿平糶經過、嗣復由主席報告平糶移交、並提議函請各有關團體、定期召開聯席會議、結束平糶事宜、均經一致通過、又關於第二决平糶、昨據米號業公會主席委員張念萱語新聲社記者云、現經往返洽商結果、決暫緩舉辦、蓋因各地國米業已登塲、行將源源運抵、届時滬市米價勢將下跌、故平糶已不需要、</p>
<h3>巿商會內　仍駐偽警</h3>
<p>北河南路天后宮上海市商會內駐守僞警，自被英防軍驅逐後、昨日上午、改由偽探駐守、至下午、竟復由武裝偽警駐守、當大光社記者前往巡視時、曾見該處天后宮之側門守衛亭內、有偽警一名在內、市商會北端警衛室前、亦有偽警一名閒步、商會大門外、有便衣偽探佇立、</p>
<h3>公共租界新訂　房捐率</h3>
<p>工部局頃發通吿略稱、本年冬季房捐、應於十月一日繳付、依照上屆納稅外僑年會議决案、自本年十月一日起、界內房捐率改爲百分之十八、界外馬路區域房捐率改爲百分之十六、又洋式房屋之房捐、不另派員收取、各該住戶、一俟接到捐票、應即逕向江西路二〇九號捐稅股繳付云、</p>
<h3>日機　轟炸興化</h3>
<p>華東社云、頃據金融界某私人方面接蘇北興化來電稱、日機於廿六日晨、叉飛至興化城內、轟炸江蘇省政府所在地、但蘇省府早已另遷他處、故被轟炸者、多屬無辜平民、損失待查、</p>
<h3>滬各業再請當局　設法抑平米價　恢復滬巿存米調查工作　向日交涉疏通米糧來源</h3>
<p>華聞社云、本市民食、因得洋米之接濟、及國內新米之登塲、嚴重問題、似已漸見解除、惟米價尙無恢復水準氣象、故各方對民食問題、仍在進行抑制中、據豆米行業公會消息、最近洋秈米每石仍在二十五六元之間、常錫高粳仍達四十元一石、當茲新米上市、洋米增進之時、若不設法抑平米價、則將來時屆年終、米價將高至不可設想、茲有本市裕生等工廠及永豐等印刷業曁各業團體、已聯名函請公共租界納稅華人會及豆米業公會、要求將本市存米數量、恢復以前每週調查公吿辦法、一面請租界當局積極向日方交涉疏通來源、務於最近期內將米價抑平至水準以下、以維生活而安人心、</p>

<h3>美揚子江巡艦　瓜姆號昨駛蕪湖　美巨型艦亞茄斯登號將抵埠　此後數月更有美艦調滬增防</h3>
<p>美揚子江艦隊之輕巡艦瓜姆號、在滬駐泊日久、茲爲巡視江防、業於昨日上午十時離滬、溯江西上、暫以蕪湖爲最終目的、據美海軍方面消息、此後揚子江艦隊、均以蕪湖爲最終目的地、以便上海局勢或有轉變時、可以迅速駛滬增防、又悉美巨型艦「亞茄斯登」號、將由馬尼刺駛滬、增加防衛實力、本埠美海軍當局、已於二十六日接獲該艦來滬電報、大的可於今日到達此間、據記者探悉、美海軍當局、在此後數月內、將續派艦隊來滬增防、</p>
<h3>法僑救護傷兵會　開成立會　法大使夫人及滬法總領　擔任該會男女委會主席</h3>
<p>廿八日法文上海日報載、昨日、本埠法僑救護傷兵會、假座環龍路法公董局禮堂、在法大使戈斯默夫人主席之下、舉行成立大會、聞開會時、由戈斯默大使夫人及巴和律師夫人、相繼發言、聲述該會宗旨、計有三端、（一）組織看護婦助手訓練班、（二）徵集捐款、以資助上海海陸軍人及被動員僑民之貧窮者、（三）運送捐款及物品與法國傷兵及難民、致於該會之會員、現計有終身正式會員卅五名、終身贊助會員廿二名、常年正式會員五十名、常年贊助六名、贈款者計有法幣一千三百四十元及一萬七千七百卅一佛郎、又在開會時、曾臨時加入爲會員者、亦有五十餘名、現聞該會選舉結果、計分男人委員會及女人委員會兩種、男人委員會主席爲鮑黛芝總領事、副主席爲賈尼埃駐滬防軍司令、司庫爲東方匯理銀行行長古司奇、秘書爲中法工商銀行行長白爾、女人委員會主席爲戈斯默大使夫人、副主席爲巴和律師夫人、秘書爲法勃爾警務總監夫人、</p>
<h3>僞警侵入滬西　目的在迫繳捐稅　居民深明大義嚴詞拒絕　工部局正籌商解決辦法</h3>
<p>僞「市府」對滬西越界築路區域之侵權行爲、最近又進一步、聞已通知越界築路區域之居民、自下季起、必須向僞「市政府」納捐、記者昨日曾以此叩之工部局某職員、據稱、僞「市府」要求收取越界築路房捐、此事在彼、尙屬創聞、彼所知者、在八一三戰前、上海市政府財政局曾有此要求、但工部局並未同意、至工部局對越界築路情形、仍極注意、現狀雖不能滿居民之意、但局中全體董事、正竭力設法以謀事態之安定、</p>
<p>僞警收捐居戶拒絕</p>
<p>滬西越界篆路以日僞方面近亟謀該段地帶經濟權之確立、因此連日來該「大道市府財政局」對於越界地段里弄間、正竭其壓力從事收取房地捐稅、昨日上午十一時許、「大道財政局」方面會派出一僞「警」名王彬者、跨騎自由車前往白利南路德和里一帶、收取房捐、比及該里十五號時、曾被該號住戶二十餘人所反對、同時因該「警」所騎自由車、忽爾失踪、於是該宅住戶遂被認爲有意爲難、當被僞「警」報吿白利南路僞「警」派出所、派「警」馳往偵查、結果曾有一呂道宣者、被「警」帶去、入晚未曾釋出、</p>
<p>僞方通知索取捐稅</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、「大道」當局、在滬西歹土中施壓迫、今又進步、而向租界馬路旁里衖中居民索取下季之捐稅矣、英文大美晚報今日（二十八日）接該區某定戶之來函、陳述該區居民之處境爲難、並表示今或須繳付兩種稅捐、</p>
<p>工部局謀解決辦法</p>
<p>今晨向工部局探悉、局方對於「市府」當局索取稅捐事、此决猶屬初聞、戰前、負責界外各區之前市府捐稅局曾提出此種要求、今晨據工部局某發言人聲稱、局方對於界外馬路問題、刻正不時加以注意、該區現况、誠不能盡使居民滿意、惟工部局董事刻均竭其所能、使之解決云、</p>
<p>西區居戶處境困苦</p>
<p>英文大美晚報所接來函略稱、工部局所棄之西區中數千居民、異常爲難、緣「新市府稅局」頃通級該區居民、謂下季稅捐、須向該局繳付、若居民拒不向大道當局納稅、則屋宇將遭阻斷與封閉、而租界負責者則冷眼旁觀、若拒不向工部局納稅、則水電將遭截斷、若向雙方俱納稅捐、則居民勢必節衣縮食、目前大道當局旣不准該區居民遷移、故唯一解決之法、似僅居民於午夜隻身逸出而已</p>
<p>紛紛遷居以避其鋒</p>
<p>愚園路自僞警扣留美水兵事件發生後、捕房每日加派探捕、在該路巡行、情形較他處爲緊張、兆豐村（兆豐公園附近）經日憲兵前往調查戶口、通知各住戶、於十月一日起、收取房租以來、住戶方面、除二房東以不願放棄所納鉅大頂費、一部份暫抱觀望外、三房客均紛紛遷移、大有人去樓空之景象、愚園路上、昨日全日到處可見搬運箱籠傢具者之忙碌情形、昨日起、更有武裝日憲兵每二人爲一組、往來巡行、至一二四九號豐田紗廠職工宿舍門前佈崗之僞警、亦由四名增至六名、</p>
<p>僞府經濟已頻絕境</p>
<p>所謂「市府」、在經濟上現正發生隱憂、大鬧恐慌、此事由來、係因「維新財政部」之協餉每月四十五萬元、忽自八月底截止取消津貼、預算「市府」開支每月須八十萬元、今半數以上忽失着落、八月底應發之八月份餉、勉强由「市府」自行籌足、九月底將發之九月份餉、則半數雖有把握、原列「維新」協餉項下之半數、則已成泡影、在萬不得已中、傳筱庵將提議至本月杪暫發半薪、按「市府」原可每月徵收苛「稅」六十萬元、自今歲二月間、被「維新」迫令取消「消費稅」後、月收减至二十萬元、連「維新」津貼仍合成六十餘萬元、一面復開徵「房捐」·「車捐」·「船捐」·「營業稅」等項、每月收入增至八十萬元、有時幾近百萬元之鉅、今「維新」藉口財庫空虛、突然取消津貼、予「市府」經濟命脈上以致命之打擊、故「市長局長」等、正計議開徵新「稅」、以圖彌補、</p>
<p>僞警佈崗迫近租界</p>
<p>僞警佈崗地點、日漸向租界方面伸展、地豐路仍止於犬西路口、億定盤路則直達海格路、昨日起僞警四名、又在大西路惇信路口佈崗、並有僞警一小隊、手擎毛瑟槍、往來巡邏、至法華橋畔駐守之僞警、近來時有查詢行人之舉動、附近居民、咸惴惴不安、</p>
<p>四處工事業已竣工</p>
<p>日僞在（一）極司非而路十一號門前、（二）開納路口日憲兵西區司令部及僞警分署前、（三）靜安寺路一七六〇號門苜、（四）海格路四四八號林氏巨厦門前、四處所築防禦工事、經數度改建、業已全部竣工、日來每處出入口、又加設守望亭、堡壘頂上、復蓋木製凉棚、作守夜及避雨之用、</p>
<p>滬西治安更形紊亂</p>

<h3>夫婦知識</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓　（時間）上午十時至下午六時　星期日休息</p>
<p>夫婦間暗疾的由來和治療</p>
<p>男女於新婚之後，有幾種毛病是很奇怪的。在表面上看起來可說是毫無異狀，可是侵害於內在的身心。較任何毛病都來得厲害，他或她的痛苦不特像啞子吃黃速，有苦難說，簡直是眼淚不斷的往自己肚裏流！</p>
<p>這是很普遍的事實，夫婦間的熱情逐漸的消滅了，情感熱烈的丈夫，竟或懷疑他的愛妻變了心，有了外遇。但同時也一種深情的妻子，驚愕地看着他丈夫的健康，日漸衰落，會在深夜做着惡夢，白日發生愁思，婚後男子的健康何以低落，據醫學上的論斷，什九必因早年犯有自凟遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，把極有關於健康的生殖腺液消耗枯竭，則凡神經衰弱，腎萎早洩，發育不全，未老先衰諸症即不一而足。此種病夫，不特有不能負荷家庭的負擔之苦，即在愛的生活上亦不能盡其義務，常把愛妻拋在半空中，在他本人果然不勝其心餘力絀之苦，而此時正情切切意綿綿的妻子受此打擊，身心上必發生着嚴重影響，許多少婦患有經亂不感，貧血不娠，乳　顏衰以及歇斯梯里等症者，什九必爲性生活的不能美滿之故，在布立顚雜誌中某醫師會發表過類似的許多病例中有說：「丈夫的早洩症治好了，妻子的不感症也痊愈了。」結論是：「女子的子宮充血症及精神失常病，與性生活不滿足的關係尤大。」</p>
<p>暗處毛病，私自痛苦，爲己爲人，均應速治！若諱疾忌醫，那就自誤誤人，陷入無窮慘境！關於治療之法，據世界名醫及余經騵，均首推服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猩猩，熊，鹿，海狗等體中提取的生殖腺素用科學方法，濃縮複製而成，所以品質之貴重，補力之偉大，堪稱爲蓋世無變。服後能於一日夜間生精補腎滋養神經健腦活血，發揮五大功能。常服更能助長發育，調整代謝，不特於短期內根治各症，更可收延年益壽，返老還童之功。女子則須服女用「生殖素」，剷除各種暗疾，功效尤著！</p>
<p>患者陳東源君，因遺精縱慾，婚後三年，患腦弱腎虧殊劇，因之失業在家，而夫婦不能和好，感情冰炭，痛苦不堪！前月就治於余，經余細察之後，即囑其在永安公司西藥部購服「希米脫氏固精片」及「生殖素」使之同服·一週後遺精卽愈。一月於茲，覺腦力淸明，精力豐足。夫婦間又回復了愛情，並新說成某大公司職務，愛情與職業同來，何等幸福！</p>
<h3>遺精症失治後的可慮</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>昨日病，今日愈，一個人的小毛病是難免的。不過一患了病切不可拖延，有許多致命的重症，都是由小病拖延而起，例如一個靑年的遺精，如能速治，本屬無關緊要，並且在治療上亦非常容易。若任其遷延失治，精關必日益鬆弛，由輕症的夢遺而進爲重症的滑精漏精者有之，因精液的長此遺洩，致精枯血竭，爆發着腎萎早洩，發育不全，神經衰弱等症者那更比比皆是，甚至成爲貧血癆瘵，短命殀殤者，亦是常有的事！</p>
<p>精液在生理學上言即所謂生殖腺液，也實是我們的生命源泉，除營生殖作用而外，功能助長發育，滋養神經，幷調整新神代謝。所以精液枯竭者，不特上述各症難以倖免。且將在人生所不可少的生殖工作上，尤覺衰弱無能，或竟完全不能人道，無法生育。因此，雖有美眷如花，亦不能消受美人之恩，只得長太息地成爲愛情中的罪人，社會中的廢人！</p>
<p>德國希米脫博士爲拯救遺精靑年起見。歷數十年之艱辛實騐，乃秘製成一種治遣特效聖藥「希米脫氏固精片」幷歷經中外名醫之採用及余之臨床實騐，均斷定此藥確有鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，服後於當夜即能收安眠止遺之神效。惟因遺精失治而巳有上述症象者，則須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以根木培補其腦腎，精血及神經，繼續服用，更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，不特於短期內可根治各症，常服更能收延年益壽，返老還童之功。</p>
<p>患者莊言强君，江西人，年二十三歲，在某大學肄業，携眷在滬，遺精已有三載，近且患腦弱腎虧殊劇。學分每不能及格，視考試如畏途，因夫婦生活之不能美滿，夫妻感情亦如冰炭，感人生之黑暗與痛苦，暑期間就余診治，即囑其在中西大藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」及「生殖素」同服，幷施以電療注射等新療術，至今一月有半，已百病霍然矣。精力豐足，且勝於常人！</p>
<h3>亂峯萎癟卽無健美</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>一個女性而有苗條的身體，高聳的乳峯，豐腴的臀部，加之紅潤的面頰，充盈的血液，在日常生活中，自然表現着愉快大方，在言語行動時，那更有無限的多情與美麗，這是多麼的足以自豪呀！若一旦佳人與才子相遇，締結了美滿的良緣。因爲愛情的融洽，必生育着伶俐的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，公餘暇日，伴着心愛的丈夫，挈着自己創造的小天使，出入於公園郊野，這樣的情景給人家看了，豈不要喊出：『只羨鴛鴦不羨仙』的呼聲呢？所以說：女性的健美，也實是她幸福的由來！</p>
<p>如果女性完全失却了健美，那她命運的悲慘是不堪設想的！你想，那個男子願意討個病而醜的黃臉婆呢？就是討了，也必不値一顧，遭受遺棄之慘！女子何以而失却健美？據醫學上的論斷，什九必因自凟縱慾，或患經亂白帶，不感不娠，貧血癆瘵等症，摧殘了卵巢機能，卵巢是女性特徵美發育的總樞，若卵巢機能衰弱，乳峯即無良好之發育，即已發育者，亦必逐漸的萎癟下去，臀部亦瘦削，亳無曲線美。血液虧損，面部顯現慘白或枯黃，呈未老先衰現象。此種女性如再爲丈夫遺棄，在此秋景蕭條之際，能無身世飄零之感！然欲謀補救，亦非難事。據世界婦科名醫及余經騐；均以服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」必可將上述症象驅之於允霄雲外。因此劑係舉世著名之婦科聖藥，服後即能調經止帶，助長發育。短期內根治各症，常服更能使乳峯聳起，面頓紅潤，永駐靑春。</p>

<h3>少婦棄夫捲逃　來滬另行改嫁　被原夫訪悉報捕拘案</h3>
<p>南京人陳善華（廿八歲）早年在原籍憑媒娶同鄕女子陶鳳英（二十二歲）爲室、詎於前年夏間、陶氏勿席捲現款及衣物等、</p>
<p>背夫出走陳乃四出偵訪、杳無消息、迨至去年六月間、經友人吿知、乃妻陶氏已改名杭小妹、現在滬與法捕房六八五號華捕管昭奎（南京人二十六歲）同居姘識、儼然夫婦、陳得悉後、即專程來滬、惟滬地遼闊複雜、不易找尋、一面由友人介紹陳在勞神父路五十號老虎灶爲夥友、直至本月二十二日、始偵悉其妻與管</p>

<h3>今日之滬西　輝煌的燈火照耀得像月宮　有可怕的魔窟亦賽如地獄</h3>
<p>據說：中國的好佛皇帝唐明皇，會夢遊月宮。又據說：西洋古時有位詩人但丁，曾入過地獄。……假使這二位現在再生的話，我得請他們去逛逛滬西，那邊輝煌的燈光，照耀得像月宮。那邊有可怕的魔窟，亦賽如地獄。</p>
<p>這決不是假話，不信你去看看，三步一「公司」，五步又是「俱樂部」。晚上的年紅燈，紅紅綠綠恍恍地像許多妖艷的少女，向人們招手。共實「敗絮其中」，它們都是賭塲烟館的代名詞。至於數目多少，簡直無從統計。</p>
<p>可憐，許多善良無知的人們，欣欣然被勾引進去，把鈔票輸光了，垂頭喪氣的溜出來。讓沿街許多電桿木上的「建設東亞新秩序」的牌子，對他們暗笑。</p>
<p>再有害人精的「花會聽簡」在某方保護之下，公開的把招牌掛在門口。上面寫早筒開什麼「九官」，中筒或夜筒又開什麼「門子」，都觸目的寫在上面。考究的還有詩謎，什麼：「人生在世本是空，錢財儲蓄有何用？」……簡直在侮辱我們的詩人李杜。請問世界上那有勸人送錢給鬼用的僞詩人？</p>
<p>兆豐花園冷冰冰地，像一朶傲菊，挿在糞堆裏，又像那貞淑的少女，冷眼地望着對過的「×××樂園」在僞警保護之下，作出各樣的迷態，吸引成千成萬的人們，川流不息地進進出出。不錯，那裏有富麗的裝璜，搖蕩的燈光，喧嘩的聲響……眞可說無奇不有。然而他們不是在拍電影，而是公然的騙錢——賭博着人們的生命！</p>
<p>十字路口，華捕的崗位已被僞警侵佔，左角子上有三個僞警背着自動步槍，右角上便立了三位巡捕，大家相持對立。大都還能看在中國人面上，相安無事（？）</p>
<p>最可惡的是一般短裝的流氓，袒胸露臂，神氣活現，有時候你路過的話，要常心白天亦會被公然搶刦，這才使你體騐到所謂「新秩序」的建設，是怎麼一回事啊！（病大蟲）</p>
<h3>從重整道德談起</h3>
<p>— 柳浪</p>
<p>日昨有重整道德運動，在滬舉行集會。察其用意，至爲良佳。蓋道德一旦爲世人所尊重，一切搶掠屠殺，自然歸於消滅。</p>
<p>祇是，在近二三年來，道德早經掃地；搶掠者固然無視於道德，遭難者復不能獲得世人道德的援助。從此，橫理勝於公理，弱肉强食，幾成爲很合法的事。</p>
<p>我們且不談世界大事，就上海一隅的現狀來說，所謂强盜精神，經二年多來的歷史敎訓，已影響及於一般的商人。商人固有商人的道德，而現在道德被掉棄，也以唯利是圖爲前提，月前商業情形之什亂，是一明證。</p>
<p>「做生意不犯法！」是商人們口裏很普遍的口號。當你因爲購貨而發覺所得遠非所値，與商人爭論時，商人必十分理直氣壯的解釋他的口號，如：「我的東西也是用錢買來的」囉！「我的東西不是搶來偷來的」囉！「做生意賺錢是應該的」囉！「你不服氣可以到法院裹去吿我」囉！諸如此類的話，即使你上了大當，也是有口難辨。你到法院里去吿，他們是殷實商人，不大會准。何况誰會爲了極細微的事情去大動干戈呢？</p>
<p>這樣的商人精神發揚光大下去，就會得到種種不同的後果。如：以提倡國貨爲名，實行掛羊頭賣狗肉。投機操縱，囤積漁利。再進一步，則以殷實商人爲幌子，暗地裏企圖作亂世的英雄豪傑」！誰能够說一聲「不」呢？他們是「做生意不犯法」的啊！</p>
<p>對於這種畸形發展，我們若提倡重整道德，固然沒有什麼不可。可惜，對牛彈琴，效力等於耳邊風吧了。</p>
<p>道德是必需加以維護的。但，這是不能空口唱唱，或是一紙宣言所能做得到的。能够根據道德，而擬製新的合法的法律，以實力爲執行法律的後盾，則大者如搶掠屠殺，小者如操縱漁利，均得受嚴厲的法律制裁。一切惡劣的傾向，自然漸可婦於消滅。</p>
<h3>電綫（械機話詩）</h3>
<p>— 如</p>
<p>其决爲當時詩人所注意的，是「電錢」。</p>
<p>最爲人所傳誦的，有霧裏看花客「上海小樂府」四章之一：</p>
<p>歡愛碧桃花　儂歌白團扇</p>
<p>電綫蟄海底　往來誰得見</p>
<p>是仿子夜吳歌之作。不過這並不能說出作者對電綫本身的理解。在這一點上，廿三間屋舊主人的「申江好」，却理解得較深刻：</p>
<p>申江好，電綫疾如霆。萬里語言同面晤，重洋信息霎時聽。機括竟無形。</p>
<p>把電綫的作用，是寫得更廣泛一點，不限於男女之私。吳榮森「時事三咏」之一「電綫」，寫得更詳。如「忽聞空谷遠傳聲」，如「消息渾如風過簫」，如「千章巨木摩空現，萬里奔馳如掣電」，皆很切題，且更周到。惜歸結到歌誦朝廷，不免於「八股詩」之誚。無名氏「洋塲四詠」之一「電綫」，其內容亦類似：</p>
<p>電氣何由達　天機不易參</p>
<p>縱橫萬里接　消息一時諳</p>
<p>竟竊雷霆力　惟將綫索探</p>
<p>從今通尺素　不藉鯉魚函</p>
<p>這是混科學迷信於一爐的「窗課」。顧當時詠「電綫」之作，大都反映此等思想，及無原則的驚奇，在初開海禁的當時，實無足怪。王之春遊日所作之「電報」，亦並無例外，也是說：</p>
<p>何領雜墨費心裁　萬里傳聲一綫來</p>
<p>山澤皆能通電氣　往還原不借風催</p>
<p>人功太巧天應忌　字跡無多意已賅</p>
<p>弱水三千飛渡便　爲儂通信到蓬萊</p>
<p>然其一小叙却極佳，文云：「考電氣報以銅爲綫，的徑分許，用西人所鍊電氣，或架木上，或置水中，引而伸之。兩頭均有機器繫之。所通之音，傳綫以行，雖千萬里，頃刻即達。」所給予印象，實較其詩作明朗。</p>
<p>故以詩言，仍不能不以霧裏看花客之作爲首選。</p>
<p>看花客「上海小樂府」餘三章，一詠「電燈」，一詠「機械」，一詠「輕氣球」，皆係混「機械」與「歡愛」於一爐，爲機械入詩之早期佳製。並附於此：</p>
<p>琉璃莫作鏡　火油休蕪燈</p>
<p>但照見郎面　不照見郞心（一）</p>
<p>昨夜錦上花　今朝途中棘</p>
<p>鐵廠生郎心　機械安可測（二）</p>
<p>明月不長明　好花不長好</p>
<p>怪煞輕氣球　隨風會顚倒（三）</p>
<h3>一個迫切的動議</h3>
<p>— 楓</p>
<p>在前幾天的報上載着：一本市寗波同鄕會及虞洽卿先生因爲鑒於目前上海工商業非常衰落，且物價高昂，生活不易，特函寗波商會轉勸同鄕，萬勿輕易來滬，免致無力謀生，而流落滬地……」這一個勸吿，我覺得極有意義的。由於這個勸喻上看來，我感到實有更進一步而擴大的必要。</p>
<p>從前在上海謀生確是比較容易些，因爲正有不少人都是赤了脚到上海來，經不了幾年的奮鬥，就成很有地位的人，更不乏有人竟發了財一躍而成面團團的富翁。這種事實的演出，大家就把上海目之爲「遍地黃金」的地方，於是都向上海來跑。但是戰後以來，上海更成了避難的安樂窩，內地及淪陷區的生活，旣是這樣艱難，而上海又是一向被稱爲遍地黃金的地方，那麼，不到上海去求生路，眞是　大了，於是，人口的急增，竟佔了全世界都市中最密的首位。然而，今日的上海，眞是個「遍地黃金」的地方嗎？物價的高漲，工商各業的衰落，上海本身將有坍倒的危險，那麼要來上海想發財，眞是痴人說夢，即使要求一噉飯之地，也如登天之難，所以虞洽卿先生能夠警吿同鄉不要輕易來滬，確是極有見地的當頭棒喝。而且近月來報上不斷載着由遠地來滬，無法謀生，致自殺的慘育新聞，就是最確實的例證。現在我極希望其餘的各縣旅滬同鄉會都不妨大家來一個懇切的勸喻，警吿同鄕們切不要貿然來滬，正如虞洽卿先生所說：「……與其來滬無法謀生而流落，毌寗在家鄉找取機會爲佳？」這種勸吿，不僅是各同鄉會所應有的職責，而且也是件够人稱頌的功德。</p>
<p>至於我們，正也應該隨時勸告同鄕，詳細的把「孤島」的眞情，吿訴他們，這樣可以補助同鄉會函勸的不足，如果我們大家都能夠實行，我想「孤島」上的關於這類自殺事件，或許會跟了减少吧。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十六回　謀興醫學造士成庠　思擴村治託兒有所</p>
<p>朱愛人便去打電話給吳君素，知道她這時已回到宿舍去了。因爲今天還只是星期四，早些的定了她的好。愛人的桌子上，便有一架電話機。提起來，撥到蘇州電話局，再轉到東吳大學敎職員寄宿舍，一刻兒工夫，便與吳君素通話了。愛人道：「你那裹接到金澹雲結婚的請帖嗎？」君素道：「早接到了。可惡她上星期六晚上，來看戲的時候，還沒有說起，現在請吃喜酒的帖子突然來了。你們預備幾時去呀？」愛人道『正是呀！我們就是要問你幾時去？因爲我和何家兩位姊姊，都預備星期六下午就去。爲的我們除了吃喜酒以外，還各有些別樣事件。不知你星期六下午去不去？倘然也在星期六去，我們就可以一同去，我們就到學校裏來看你。的定趁幾點鍊的車，在火車上也可以熱鬧些。』君素道：「星期六下午也好，反正星期六下午，我是沒有課的。她也有帖子給我妹妹君可，她本來想不去，我勸她一同去玩玩。你們說趁幾點鐘車，我這裹都可以的。」愛人和何家姊妹商量以後，說是：『我們趁三點鐘的車去吧。起初澹雲還說這回結婚要省儉些，現在地方就借了萬國大飯店，是上海頂大的旅館，還能省儉得下嗎？這是一次頂闊氣的結婚了。」君素道：「這也不能怪她，恐怕在她也無可如何吧。因爲她的職業是如此，一天到晚，所結交的都是外國第一流的人物。知道了她這决結婚，都要來吃她的喜酒。招待外國朋友，太吝嗇了不好，這是國體關係咧。好在金澹雲是不要緊，她有靠山，她的靠山很硬，決不是像人家所說的冰山。』愛人道：「你說的靠山是誰呢？可不是蘇理雅太太嗎？』君素道：「怎麼不是？蘇老太婆簡直把她和自己的女兒一般看待。她雖有個親生的女兒，在自己國內。但她對於澹雲，也不輸於親生的女兒。余澹雲就算是蘇老太的中國女兒，你說對不對？這一回，澹雲結婚，她便是主婚人。因爲澹雲的父親，是位先烈，而老太太也已過世了。大概澹雲是要省儉的，蘇老太不答應，她主張要闊綽。他們美國人，當然是全世界的闊客囉。」　（一八六）</p>

<h3>金素琴女士自述：演劇十四年（上）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>編者介紹：金素琴，杭籍，工靑衣劇，唱做擅兼，色藝無雙，大江南北，所至有聲。「江南第一坤旦」頻年艷稱衆口，實至名歸，良非偶然。而於致力改良平劇一舉，足見思想新銳，抱負非凡，是允令人爭爲刮目，値得更予重視者矣。</p>
<p>金素琴之桃花扇劇照</p>
<p>藝人漫記</p>
<p>唱戲眞是一件很繁難的艱苦工作！回想我從童年學戲，獻身舞台以還，　時將及二十載，行程何止萬里，就經騵說來，似該算是相當的豐富了；但在藝術方面，自己很慚愧的只是幸博虛名，委實並沒有甚可以感及欣慰的怎樣成就。</p>
<p>七歲學戲</p>
<p>當幼年時期，從七歲起我就開始學戲，專習旦角——靑衣與花衫。就爲專力練戲不使分心關係，那時候便沒有讀書；到後來長大成年，自己發覺了這種錯誤，雖即於努力自修下不斷奮進，無如文字上的認識與運用，畢竟淺薄得很，而自己是太嫌不够了。現在，我於每天看報，和常閱新文藝書冊，如巴金等名著小說，用資消遺時，不禁常會深深地感到幼年失學的苦惱。</p>
<p>遍遊南北</p>
<p>我的演劇生活，始於十歲那年，第一决係在長沙登台。此後，歷遊長江各埠，經久輾轉於江浙兩地，以至南及閩粵，先後計歷五六年。民十八年，初决到上海來，隸於前三星舞台，和趙如泉先生等一起，專演「水泊梁山」「彭公案」等連台本戲達三足年。嗣又兩度赴漢，北至東三省及平津兩地演唱近兩年。民二十五年階遊回滬，膺聘黃金大戲院和李萬春先生合作三個月，轉入共舞台一月。翌年。叉在天蟾舞臺唱了近半年。以後，「八一三」戰事發生，一度和歐陽予倩先生共同致力改良平劇工作，在滬演唱近兩月。去冬，就聘「黃金」，不久，旋又前往香港一行。這樣東奔西跑的演劇生活史，算來却已共歷十四年了。</p>
<h3>「更新」更新後　平角登臺第一夕記</h3>
<p>— 乃我</p>
<p>更新舞臺全部更新，派人北上，邀來大批平角，業於中秋佳節，與滬人開始相見。是夕座位賣滿，張善琨氏偕陳雲裳，黎明暉，童月娟，陳燕燕四大影星同來觀劇，更爲該院生色不少，記者亦爲座上客之一。抵院，李多奎之釣金龜，巳成尾聲，多奎多年不南來矣，嗓音之響亮，一如往昔，故極受臺下人歡迎。繼釣金龜後，梁慧超之挑滑車上塲，慧超爲後起武生之一，年僅十九，腰腿工夫極佳，一條腿，可媲美共舞臺之王少樓，唯海氣十足，殊不可取；雖能配合臺下人胃口，但梁喜賣弄腰腿工夫，致身段亮相，往往雷同，僅能稱一「衝」字，火氣未脫，功候則尙淺也。嗓子尙係童子音，吃虧不能響堂，但尙不失一人才，能待以時日，有厚望焉。陳少霖前决曾隨程硯秋來滬，但未能予滬人以深刻印象，昨觀少霖演捉放宿店，較前確有進步，身上已不如前决之呆板，惜嗓音欠響亮，（調頭並不低，坐在六排後，竟不易聽淸。）致如「他一家大小遭禍殃」等句，皆不能翻高，似不甚受聽。少霖非本錢不足，或係旅途勞頓所致，亦未可知。全劇以宿店一塲之大段慢板，最爲動聽，亦可謂少霖唱二簧，比唱西皮佳妙也。李春恒之曹操，完全郝派作風，學郝壽臣，比袁世海像得多，不過有些怪腔怪調，臺下聆之，如聆言菊朋之首腔一般，不禁忍俊發笑。大軸四五花洞，以梁韻秋李畹雲爲眞潘金蓮，吳紫秋趙金蓉爲假潘金蓮，「不由得潘金蓮怒惱眉梢」之四句慢板，並不是每二人唱兩句，眞潘金蓮唱完第一句，假潘金運再重複第一句，此無疑各顯神通，而成對峙之局，亦舞臺上輕易不多見之事也。論唱工，趙金蓉並不遜於吳素秋，李梁二人則稍差，故眞潘金蓮所唱之彩聲，乃無假潘金蓮多也。論扮相，四人之中，當以吳素秋居首座，吳之外，李畹雲綽約多姿，要亦佳麗。此外身段臺步四人均見佳妙，此殊値得一記者。孫盛武之知縣，詼諧百出，丑角中之俊佼也。聞更新之計劃，將由吳趙梁三人，輪流演唱，各唱十日，此三人各有所長，且捧塲之仕，頭不乏人，故諒來號召力必不弱也。</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>風流孽障</h3>
<p>— 企華　＂Bachelor　Mother＂</p>
<p>看完了「風流孽障」出來，果然被這個聰明的故事所返引着，不禁對着門口的廣吿畫作會心的微笑。但是在汽車行列中，忽然穿出一個年老的婦人，懷中袋着一個衣不蔽體的孩子，向老爺太太們求乞。這老婦人的悲痛的臉色，和那嗚咽的聲音，彷彿就是「風流孽障」、中拋棄那嬰孩的婦人一樣，於是，我的思潮又回到這聰明的故事中去，當大家被這奇趣的故事引着發笑的時候，有誰注意到那個拋棄孩子的婦人嗎？如果我們的視綫能够跳過開麥拉，而追縱着那位婦人，那將看到的又是什麼？但是劇作者是聰明的，他拋棄了「風流孽障」的主角，而且使我們忘記她。</p>
<p>好萊塢現在正競攝着喜劇，或者就是這個緣故。但是無論劇本編製技巧如何高明，也終於在我們的面前暴露了弱點，那短短的幾呎膠片，那位婦人的曇花一現，也使我們看到了這社會的另一面，失業，貧困，無數飢寒的面孔！</p>
<p>這聰明的故事，更經過導演者煊染以後，眞是噱頭邪邪氣氣，他幾乎使觀衆的笑聲沒有休止的時候。</p>
<p>有幾塲戲更是可愛。如（一）波麗被召到經理室去，大衛允許波麗復職，幷增加她的薪金，導演者把大衛，波麗及嬰兒堂職員三者之間，各人不同的思緒，充份地發揮了他的圓熟的喜劇手腕。（二）除夕之夜，大衛和波麗在歡樂的人羣走散，對面相見而無法招呼，於是他們在人叢中跳起來；兩人對面時，因因遭聲昔的喧雜，他們的說話祗見嘴唇張合，—這兩個特寫鏡頭非常新穎，而且陪襯了大除夕夜羣衆歡樂的情形。（三）大衛的父親尾隨着大衛。誤以孩子爲自己的孫兒；及（四）父子早餐時的爭執，都是風趣之至。最後由孩子遺落一隻玩具鴨子而團叙，也頗見導演者的聰明。</p>
<p>琴述羅吉絲在「龍門花月」中已便我們知道她不僅僅是一個歌舞演員，波麗這脚色，演得不壞飾墨林的演員也很好。</p>
<h3>閒畫遊藝界　（十七）</h3>
<p>— 蘇州文書　文　岫烟圖</p>
<p>蘇州文書的說派，與彈詞並無出入；唱詞則別樹一幟，逈不相類：偶然試聽，頗覺口味一新，久聽則令人生厭，（也許這是我一己的偏見）。</p>
<p>此中代表人物，當然是王寳慶（實際上也祇有這麼一二人），一　「十嘆空」，曾經流行一時。</p>
<p>過去，蘇州文書是相常走紅的，現在則已由「絇爛」而返於「平淡」了。</p>
<h3>上海之歌播音別紀</h3>
<p>— 遊子</p>
<p>「月到中秋分外明」這「孤島」，根本就「低氣壓」使你呼吸不到一品目由的空氣，然而，季節却又走到環之秋節了。</p>
<p>在各大公司的市招掛上了「蘇廣月餅」的布幟，秋天的風也許會多少吹開一些心頭的陰影，拖着沉重的心想在「中秋佳節」痛飲幾盃五茄皮或月餅，可是，這生活「現實」的鞭子則又不能容許。</p>
<p>踏上南京路，在電梯中不自知的走進了新都飯店。</p>
<p>電影明星聯合會串的歌劇「上海之歌」的播音，將點綴一下玻璃電台的中秋吧！</p>
<p>燦爛的是一片影人們的星光，有穿着紅馬夾的白虹，笑喀喀的孫敏，嬌嫩的周曼華，玲瓏的蔡瑾，音專的學生數十個，有一個呌做張昊的正滿頭汗粒地拿着指揮鞭領導着樂隊合唱呢！</p>
<p>黎錦光之外，我可眞忘不了那個歸化中國的提琴家，那位五十四歲的梅夏先生，那梵華林，美麗的獨奏，是深深地把我的整個性靈沉醉了。</p>
<p>「上海之歌」沒有「牧歌」可聽，但當演奏「我愛祖國的山河」時，我可懂小了爲什麼作曲者會有那個歌，淪陷的「孤島」不依舊是「滿眼笙歌」嗎？</p>
<p>一片星光，是點綴了「新都」的中秋。</p>
<h3>黎園外紀　伶人與鴉片</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>今昔名伶多吸食鴉片，汪伶隱（笑儂）生前嗜之最深，每日能抽烟膏二兩，據說當他起床以先，例須由其姨太太先就榻側向其面上　烟若干口，彼方能稍稍蠕動；决用小茶壺灌以參湯少許，再將燒好之烟送彼口中，笑儂閉目連吸十數口，始可慢慢睜眼講話，披衣下床，洗臉嗽口畢，復躺下再抽。天氣晴朗，精神較好時，可自燒自抽，否則仍須由在妾代裝，此時非連盡數十筒，不能進早點。所以每逢館子有戲，非由園主預酬在妾若干金，彼不願盡心服侍或催促在氏早赴後臺也。</p>
<p>伶人喜愛鴉片最大的原因，要不外下述數端：（一）屬於遺傳性的。（二）自幼耳濡目染，以爲非吸此不能成名角，常見許多名伶授徒時，自躺於烟榻上，令其徒垂手立於榻前。當敎授戲詞或改正某腔時，二目注硯燈火，且唸且繞，意頗消閑自得，而其徒背誦戲詞時，亦目注於此，不稍斜視，此則與學校授課時之情形，大不相同。蓋烟榻譬之課堂，烟盤猶如黑板，烟籤權作敎鞭，烟槍可當刀槍把子或馬鞭等使用。又口中唸鑼鼓時，烟籤擊於烟盤上，亦可代表鼓板，所以老師是臥而敎之，學生則直立於烟榻前敬謹受敎，如此習以爲常，覺得先生這樣子敎徒弟，不但是十分舒適，而且派頭十足。等到自個稍微有點名氣啦，也就不因不由的一意摹仿着他老師那個派頭，置辦一套烟具，呼呼的抽了起來。允其是譚派鬚生，因爲小呌天有奉旨吸烟那段遺事，髣髴是不抽烟就够不上稱「譚派」似的。故而凡號爲譚派或譚之再傳弟子的，十人中恐怕就有十個癮君子，不吸烟的，我實在舉不出一個人來。　（一〇九）</p>

<h3>Moscow Evidently the Center of the Situation - Britain Plans to Send Senior Officials to Appease - Complex German-Soviet Negotiations Difficult to Reach Agreement - Estonian Foreign Minister Flies to Soviet Capital Again</h3>
<p>London - According to news from here today, Britain is still trying to win over the Soviet Union. Last night, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, met with the British Foreign Secretary Halifax to answer various questions raised by the British side on Saturday. It is said that former Prime Minister Lloyd George will be sent to Moscow as a special envoy of Britain, and the Minister of Commerce, Stanley, will also accompany him. According to the Soviet side here, the Soviet Union is ready to start commercial negotiations with Britain. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London - The British government yesterday proposed to the Soviet Union to restart talks on commercial and economic issues between the two countries. According to well-informed sources here, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, gave a positive answer to Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon, but said that the British government must be prepared to provide commercial credit loans to the Soviet Union and allow the Soviet Union to export a large number of goods to Britain. Diplomatic circles here believe that the Soviet government's attitude is due to the fact that the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is in Moscow talking with the Soviet authorities. It is said that Ribbentrop wants to alienate Turkey from Britain and France on the one hand, and proposes to the Soviet Union to jointly adopt a "peace offensive" on the other hand, so that on the day peace is realized, all European political issues and all "intolerable" territorial issues will be thoroughly reviewed. If the Western European democracies refuse peace, they will instigate the Soviet Union to cooperate with Germany, and reward the Soviet Union for its demands on Bessarabia province of Romania. At the same time, the Baltic Sea coastal countries will be divided into the spheres of influence of Germany and the Soviet Union. Because of Ribbentrop's activities, the Soviet Union has attached various conditions to the issue of British-Soviet economic talks. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to today's Japan Times, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, assured the British Foreign Secretary Halifax on Tuesday that the Soviet Union's relationship with Germany is limited to a non-aggression treaty, and that it would not want to go beyond this. He also said that the Soviet Union will continue to maintain a neutral attitude towards the British-German war. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London - According to reliable sources in Berlin, the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's decision to go to Moscow is to conclude an agreement with the Soviet authorities to jointly maintain the new situation in Poland by force when necessary. At the same time, the issues of the Baltic Sea coastal countries and the Balkan Peninsula will be submitted for discussion, but Germany has no intention of supporting the Soviet Union's various demands on Estonia. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will continue negotiations on the situation of various countries in the world this afternoon. Because the content of the talks has not yet been released, speculation has arisen. Paris officials believe that the Soviet Union is now demanding significant sacrifices from the German side in the Baltic Sea area as the price for the Soviet Union to continue to maintain neutrality. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, accompanied by the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, met with the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, again at 2:00 PM today. In addition, Estonian Foreign Minister Selter will conduct talks with the Soviet authorities. It is widely rumored that the Soviet Union will conclude a military alliance treaty with Estonia. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Regarding the first round of talks between the Soviet Russian authorities and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, the Soviet Union issued an official report as follows: On September 27, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov held talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to discuss various issues related to the Polish incident. The talks lasted for two hours. Communist Party Secretary-General Stalin, German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg, and Soviet Russian Ambassador to Germany Shkvartsev participated in the meeting. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to well-informed sources here, the itinerary of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's decision to visit Moscow, although not yet fully arranged, is believed to be longer than his first visit because the issues being discussed are more complicated than before and cannot be resolved in a day or two. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here at 5:40 PM this afternoon on a special plane for German leader Hitler. Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin, German Ambassador Schulenburg, and Italian Ambassador Rosso welcomed him at the airport. The flags of Germany and the Soviet Union were hung everywhere in the airport. A Red Army team also saluted Foreign Minister Ribbentrop with guns. Ribbentrop then went to the Kremlin Palace with Ambassador Schulenburg at 10:00 PM to visit People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov and held talks with each other. It is said that Ribbentrop's entourage consisted of 38 people, including many economic, military, and diplomatic experts. The "Mayor of Danzig Free City" Forster was also among them. The entourage arrived in two planes this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Estonian Foreign Minister Selter arrived here at 6:00 PM this afternoon on a Swedish national airline mail plane, just a few minutes after German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here. Accompanying Foreign Minister Selter were the Estonian Envoy to the Soviet Union, Leo August, Speaker of the House of Representatives Ulots, Professor Peepus, an expert in international law, and the Soviet Envoy to Estonia, Nikitin. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Estonian Capital - The government authorities here are tight-lipped about the content of the Soviet demands. Officials only said, "This matter is being carefully studied by the government and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives." The government also issued a short communique this morning, stating that Foreign Minister Selter, accompanied by several legal and diplomatic experts, has once again gone to Moscow to hold talks with the Soviet authorities. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to well-informed sources here, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu did not hold talks with the Soviet Russian authorities again yesterday, but it is known that he plans to stay in Moscow for two more days. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Baltic Sea Problem - Estonia's Situation Increasingly Difficult - Soviet Aircraft Discovered Over Estonia Again - Soviet Ship Sunk by Submarine</h3>
<p>Estonian Capital - Authoritative sources here claim that multiple Soviet aircraft flew over Estonia again yesterday. According to reports, when Soviet aircraft first entered Estonian territory on the 26th, the Estonian government protested to the Soviet Union. It is said that Soviet aircraft were found near the Estonian capital and Arensborg on Ösel Island. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet ship "Metallist," with a displacement of approximately 4,000 tons, was sunk by a submarine of unknown nationality in Narva Bay at around 6:00 PM today. Of the 24 crew members, 19 were rescued by Soviet patrol boats, and the whereabouts of the remaining five are unknown. (TASS dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet Union has taken an unusually serious attitude towards the incident. Political figures here believe that the incident will inevitably affect the negotiations between Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov and Estonian Foreign Minister Selter. It is generally believed here that the Soviet government will demand certain military rights in Estonian ports. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Latvian Capital - It is heard that the Soviet Union has demanded from Estonia that Dago Island and Ösel Island become Soviet naval bases. Dago Island is the largest of the Estonian-owned islands near the Gulf of Finland, separated from Ösel Island by a strait. It was owned by Germany during the war. The Soviet Union is not satisfied with the Estonian government's explanation regarding the escape of Polish submarines from Tallinn Port, hence this demand. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Finnish Capital - According to French newspapers, the Soviet Union will raise the issue of the Åland Islands again. The Finnish Foreign Minister has absolutely denied this information. He solemnly stated that the Finnish capital has not received any information regarding this intention. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Finnish Capital - According to reliable sources here today, if the Soviet Union can occupy the militarily important Estonian islands, it will at least be temporarily satisfied. However, the current Estonian government is not regarded as very friendly by the Soviet Union. Therefore, in order to improve relations between the two countries, it is also possible that the Soviet Union will demand the reorganization of the Estonian government. Currently, Estonian newspapers and radio stations are all silent on the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union has begun its counter-propaganda, and the Soviet Navy is patrolling along the coast of Estonia in teams. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Estonian Capital - The Soviet semi-official side issued a message on the 25th of this month stating that a Polish submarine detained in Tallinn Port had escaped after being repaired and refueled. It then appeared once in the Gulf of Finland, indicating that Estonia has a secret base on its coast, dedicated to the use of submarines of unknown nationality. The semi-official news agency Eda has been ordered to issue a message to firmly deny this. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Estonian Capital - The newspapers here today published articles emphasizing the simultaneous visits of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Estonian Foreign Minister Selter to Moscow. The semi-official "Esti" newspaper strongly stated that after Poland disappeared from the map of Europe, the balance of power in the Baltic Sea will inevitably be affected. Britain and France have become out of reach, and the situation in the future will inevitably be dominated by the two powers of Germany and Russia. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>German-Soviet and Baltic and Balkan Peninsula Countries Situation Map</p>
<h3>Balkan Peninsula Problem - Germany Plans to Induce Turkey to Remain Neutral - Soviet Troops Arrive at the Hungarian Border - Yugoslavia Negotiates with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>London - The morning newspapers here are all commenting extensively on the "Moscow Mystery." The diplomatic affairs reporter of The Times stated, "The German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's return to Moscow while Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is visiting the Soviet Union shows that the purpose of this trip is not limited to establishing a buffer state in Poland. He may demand that the Soviet Union induce Turkey to distance itself from Western European countries. However, it is not known whether the Soviet Union can do so, and it is not necessarily certain that Turkey will listen." The Times also published a telegram from its Moscow correspondent stating, "Diplomatic circles here are quite surprised by the coincidence of the German and Turkish Foreign Ministers visiting the Soviet Union. Although Turkish officials here say that the two are not related, they also admit that Foreign Minister Saracoğlu's stay here will be extended due to the arrival of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. It is heard that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop wants the Soviet Union to advise Turkey to remain neutral so that Italy can help Germany in the war. As for the Soviet Union's wishes for the Baltic Sea coastal countries and the attitude that Germany will take, it is unknown, but the Soviet authorities may put a fait accompli before Foreign Minister Ribbentrop." (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The Turkish Ambassador to Germany presented his credentials to Prime Minister Hitler yesterday. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Aktai, hosted a luncheon yesterday for the Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu. Soviet dignitaries Molotov, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Potemkin, Tikanov, Lozovsky, Talentyev, and all the staff of the Turkish Embassy were invited to accompany him. During the luncheon, Saracoğlu and Molotov exchanged congratulatory remarks. (TASS dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital - Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is conducting talks with the Soviet authorities in Moscow. According to well-informed sources here, Saracoğlu intends to propose a plan to the Soviet Union, advocating the formation of an expanded Balkan consultation group to form a truly neutral group of countries, and has notified the Romanian government of its contents. According to this plan, Romania may have to make some territorial sacrifices, and must obtain the unanimous consent of all parties in the country. Therefore, there are reports that the authorities intend to recruit various opposition parties, including the National Peasants' Party, to form a government of national unity. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital - It is heard that Soviet troops, after arriving at the border between Poland and Hungary, contacted the Hungarian border guards today. Soviet officers asked Hungarian officers to indicate the boundary line to avoid disputes. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital - It is rumored that the German government sent an aide-mémoire to Yugoslavia, the content of which was to put forward various demands in the economic area. Informed sources here have firmly denied this, stating that German and Yugoslav representatives are scheduled to negotiate here on the 28th of this month in order to resolve various economic issues between the two sides. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to the Berlin correspondent of the "Hamburg Foreign News," which has close ties with the German Foreign Ministry, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's decision to visit Moscow will increase the anger and anxiety of the enemy countries, because they do not want to see Germany and the Soviet Union achieve friction-free cooperation. The German-Soviet agreement is in response to the needs of the international situation, and therefore has a very solid foundation. The purpose of Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow is to discuss the various political issues arising after the annexation of Poland. Seeing that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is also in the Russian capital, it can be seen that Turkish foreign policy has been affected after the German-Soviet rapprochement. The eventual result will be that Germany will have greater freedom of action, and British interests will be completely expelled from the Balkan Peninsula. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The War in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces</h3>
<p>Global attention is focused on the confusing and ever-changing international situation, which has now lasted for over a month. Even in China, where we are engaged in a war of resistance with pain and suffering close to our hearts, people inevitably cast their gaze towards the international arena. Isn't this a sign that peace is indivisible and that the world's affairs are unstable and losing their center of gravity?</p>
<p>In our opinion, the seeds of aggression were sown long ago. Because certain nations, who seemed to bear the heavy responsibility of influencing global changes, lacked the resolve and were content with temporary ease and security, they allowed the flames of aggression to spread and become the norm. Like nurturing a boil, we reap the consequences today. Czechoslovakia was sacrificed at the negotiating table and written off lightly. Wasn't this a masterpiece of peace, seemingly indicating that there were ways to eliminate disaster? But in the end, weapons were drawn, and even though millions of lives were used to protect Poland, it did nothing to avert Poland's disintegration. As events unfold now, the situation is worsening. We ask, what will become of Estonia's fate tomorrow, and who will control it? What will become of Romania's fate the day after tomorrow, and who will control it? What will become of the fate of the other small countries in Northern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Southeastern Europe, and who will control it? Violence reigns supreme, order is shattered, and the countries of Europe can only pray for divine protection, hoping that those who seize power will show mercy. Is there really any way for them to survive on their own? Looking back eight or nine years ago, Geneva was filled with dignitaries, all gathered to discuss world affairs, dismissing the sparks of the Mukden Incident as nothing. Now, they only see iron and blood as the highest authority. The clash of iron and blood will determine fate through victory and defeat. The unknowable fork in the road ahead lies in whether each individual destiny will await a final resolution through the iron-blooded contest of the entire world, or whether each contest will determine the outcome, leading to peace for the entire world. According to the former perspective, we await the expansion of the war, which is what Czechoslovakia and Poland must hope for. According to the latter perspective, we should each struggle in our own local wars. As for the Sino-Japanese War, if the European war expands into a world war, then China and Japan cannot remain outside the overall resolution, as the overall situation and trend are irresistible. Otherwise, the center of gravity in the Far East remains tied to China and Japan. Those who allow their thoughts to wander far afield are mistaken.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War has now lasted for twenty-seven months, with countless battles large and small. There have been no major battles in the recent three to five months, but in the past week, the situation has suddenly become active. The Japanese army has launched a major offensive in Hunan, clearly aiming for Changsha. The Chinese army has counterattacked in Jiangxi, both to relieve the threat to Hunan's flank and to shake the Japanese army's westward advance. According to war reports, the Japanese army in Hunan has made slight progress, while the Chinese army in Jiangxi has retaken many strategically important points in a matter of days, reportedly annihilating a large number of Japanese troops. It is a well-known fact that the Sino-Japanese War does not place importance on gains and losses of land, even of small territories. However, what both sides are demonstrating today, besides military significance, should also be given attention. First, the Sino-Japanese front line, from Shanxi to Guangdong, does not allow for distinguishing importance. However, in the past three to five months, the Japanese army has been managing Shanxi and coveting Shaanxi, and the signs are very clear. Now, they are attacking Hunan instead of encroaching on Shaanxi. Although this can be explained by the fact that they were unable to achieve their goals in managing Shanxi, after the signing of the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan, militarily speaking, it would not be difficult for the Japanese to transfer heavy troops from the Northeast to threaten Shanxi and Shaanxi, in order to achieve their plan to penetrate Shaanxi and cut off China's northwest transportation. If they are not doing this, is there a political or diplomatic reason behind it? This question cannot be speculated on. However, in the future, we may be able to discover something by considering this question in conjunction with the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan. Second, how long the Chinese army can hold Changsha and at what cost is still unknown. With the strength of the Japanese army's land and air forces, capturing Changsha is not a difficult task. Moreover, with the main force of the Japanese army in Hunan, the Chinese army will strategically not engage it with its main force. Therefore, if Changsha eventually falls to the Japanese army, it should not be considered unexpected. However, the gains made by the Chinese army in Jiangxi are at least unprecedented in the past three months. This shows that the morale and strength of the Chinese army's resistance, after twenty-seven months, can still maintain its strength. As the Japanese army advances further west, its front line becomes longer and thinner, which means that the opportunities for the Chinese army to counterattack increase, exposing its weaknesses even more. The Chinese army displaying its strength and the Japanese army exposing its weaknesses have a major impact on the morale of people at home and abroad, and are of significant value, beyond material gains and losses. Third, there is an unexpected phenomenon in the Sino-Japanese War: within China, the generals and soldiers who are actually engaged in the war of resistance, risking their lives, are full of vigor, while those who are experiencing ideological shifts in their awareness of the war of resistance are not the generals and soldiers. The recent war in Jiangxi is proof of this. Internationally, China has consistently refused to compromise, while the allied nations that claim to sympathize with China's war of resistance and share close interests with it frequently compromise. Since the outbreak of the European war, the trend towards compromise has been obvious. All these phenomena, in fact, are insufficient to sway China's war of resistance. The various castles in the air created by these phenomena may be sufficient to influence international opinion, adding a layer of confusion to the turbulent international situation. The recent fierce battles in Hunan and Jiangxi can use facts to illustrate that China is continuing its war of resistance, that China has the strength to continue its war of resistance, and that it is also a key to eliminating international confusion.</p>
<p>If China abandons its war of resistance, it will only solve the China problem for Japan. If China is determined to resist, it will be an important foundation for an equal resolution of the Sino-Japanese problem. If all problems become world problems and await a comprehensive solution, then whether Czechoslovakia, which perished without a fight, and Poland, which disintegrated in battle, have a place in the overall solution is a major question. China, on the other hand, must maintain a superior position in the overall solution by continuing its war of resistance. When the Soviet Union sent troops into Poland, it announced to the world that it did not expect Poland to collapse so quickly, to the point of not being a country anymore. Such words are not enough to serve as a lesson, but they can also add an annotation to the continuation of the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>England Increases Taxes by 200 Million Pounds to Cover Wartime Expenses; Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon Proposes Budget, Unanimously Approved by the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon today proposed an emergency wartime budget in the House of Commons, stating that both direct and indirect taxes would be greatly increased, and the income tax would be increased to seven shillings and six pence per pound. Taxes on all luxury goods will also be increased. According to statistics, the increased taxes will generate 107,000,000 pounds this year and 126,500,000 pounds next year. The Chancellor stated that the price of victory, however high, is worth paying, as it is the price of freedom for the British people and allows Europe and the British people to live. The tax changes stipulated in the wartime budget include the following: (1) Income tax, which is currently five shillings and six pence, will be immediately increased to seven shillings, and further increased to seven shillings and six pence from January 1, 1940; (2) A tax will be levied on profits exceeding pre-war standards at 60%, or the current national defense contribution will be levied, whichever is greater; (3) Inheritance tax will be increased by 10% for estates valued between 10,000 and 50,000 pounds, and by 20% for estates above 50,000 pounds; (4) Beer tax will be increased by one penny per pint; (5) The basic tax on alcohol will be increased by ten shillings per standard gallon; (6) Tobacco tax will be increased by two shillings per pound, i.e., increased to three and a half pence per ounce; (7) Sugar tax will be increased by one penny per pound; (8) The tax on imported light wine will be increased by one shilling per gallon, and the tax on strong wine will be increased by four shillings per gallon. The main point of this budget is that the revised budget expenditure for this year is 1,933,000,000 pounds. The income of the revised budget, including the new tax revenue of 107,000,000 pounds, is 995,000,000 pounds. The difference between the two amounts is 938,000,000 pounds, which will be made up by raising debts. Among them, 500,000,000 pounds that have already been approved for raising will be allocated from the national defense bond.</p>
<p>After the Chancellor's speech, the House of Commons unanimously approved the resolution to implement the Chancellor's proposals within one hundred minutes. Both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party supported this wartime budget. Labor Party leader Clement Attlee said that there was an emergency budget eight years ago. In his opinion, what led England to this current situation was the nationally united government at that time. He agreed with the Chancellor's proposal to raise taxes to raise funds. He believed that increasing income tax was the right way to do it. In any case, the people of England should not delay paying for the war expenses until the future, nor should they borrow money and have future generations repay it. However, he could not agree with the changes to the child allowance plan, because this is not the time to encourage having fewer children. He also asked the government to reconsider increasing the sugar tax. He welcomed the wartime profit tax, but felt it would be best to eliminate wartime profits altogether.</p>
<p>Liberal Party leader Archibald Sinclair said that the financial burden on the people of the country is extremely heavy, but we have to take it on. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon has now explained the facts in detail to the people of the country, and no longer makes things vague and unclear as he did since he began to reorganize the military, which is commendable. The Liberal Party reserves the right to criticize certain points in the future, but at present, it feels that this bill should be supported. He asked the Chancellor to consider forming a General National Expenditure Committee to audit the use of funds and prevent waste and corruption. Although this budget is very serious, it is still far from the limit of the country's financial resources. The people of the country can still accept this kind of sacrifice as a necessary method for achieving victory.</p>
<p>Communist Party member John McGovern said that this budget is a terrible footnote to the capitalist system. He does not pay attention to how much the income tax or wealth tax is increased, but he is prepared to bet his life that the rich will be richer after the end of the war than they are today.</p>
<p>Independent Conservative Party member William Mabane then spoke, expressing his doubts about the windfall tax and asking why the excess profits tax was only limited to 60%, and advocating that a capital tax should be applied now instead of waiting until after the end of the war. The debate in the House of Commons was temporarily suspended at this point and will be discussed again tomorrow.</p>
<p>When Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon presented his budget, he first said that when he presented the budget to the House of Commons at the end of April this year, he estimated that the expenditure for this year would be 1,323,000,000 pounds, of which 630,000,000 pounds would be for national defense, and he expected the income to be 942,000,000 pounds. The shortfall of 380,000,000 pounds would be raised within this year. Before the Financial Law was passed, the amount of national defense expenditure for this year had increased to 730,000,000 pounds, and the amount required to be raised at that time had reached 480,000,000 pounds. When Congress was adjourned in August, the total amount of expenditure for this year was 1,453,000,000 pounds, of which 502,000,000 pounds had to be obtained from borrowing. All these huge numbers are based on the assumption that England would not be at war this year. After the outbreak of the war on September 3, Congress quickly passed a supplementary appropriation of 500,000,000 pounds. He could not guarantee that this number would be enough to meet all the needs until the end of the current budget year, i.e., the end of March next year. The total amount of expenditure for this year will be around 2,000,000,000 pounds. There is no need to say that a new budget urgently needs to be prepared. This war has caused England to encounter special economic difficulties. If it is not dealt with in an appropriate manner and with a courageous spirit, England's ability to continue fighting the war to achieve a victorious ending will be greatly weakened. Finance is the fourth weapon of national defense. If finance fails, then the entire war effort that it supports will collapse. There are only two ways to make the best use of productivity, namely, taxes and borrowing. England must of course use both. The amount of money needed by the treasury is unprecedented. In order to meet the huge wartime needs, taxes have to be heavy. However, it is obviously impossible to rely entirely on tax revenue to pay for all war expenses, so it must be supplemented by the income from large-scale national defense bonds. When the issuance of national defense bonds is announced in the future, it is the duty of every citizen to enthusiastically contribute and actively subscribe. As for the issuance of new national debt, the time is not yet ripe. The solicitation of various bonds is often left to the future. At present, it is hoped that people and organizations across the country will not use capital for unnecessary purposes, and should try to be frugal, so that they can transfer their financial resources to subscribe to new debt issued for the continuation of the war. This emergency budget will require the people of the country to make major sacrifices. An income tax of five shillings and six pence is already very high, but in a war environment, it still needs to be greatly increased. The proposed additional amount is not intended to be fully implemented this year. For the whole year, the standard income tax should be seven shillings and six pence per pound. However, this year, it is proposed to set the standard income tax at seven shillings. Five shillings and six pence will be paid in the first quarter, and seven shillings and six pence will be paid in the other three quarters. On average, seven shillings will be paid each quarter. As for the income tax surcharge, this tax rate will range from fifteen pence to nine shillings and six pence. Those with an income of 2,000 pounds will pay fifteen pence, while those with an income of more than 30,000 pounds will pay nine shillings and six pence. In this way, the surcharge alone can generate 5 million pounds this year and 8 million pounds for the whole year. From today onwards, inheritance worth more than 10,000 pounds and less than 50,000 pounds will be taxed by one-tenth, and more than 50,000 pounds will be taxed by two-tenths. It is estimated that this item can generate 6 million pounds for the whole year. The poll tax will be increased from tomorrow onwards, and it is expected to generate 11,000,000 pounds this year and 27,000,000 pounds for the whole year. The price of alcohol will be increased, which can generate 3,500,000 pounds annually. The excess profit tax will be applied to all industrial and commercial groups in accordance with the method of the munitions industry profit tax. The Chancellor then said that the capital tax had been studied, but it was felt that it was not appropriate to do it during the war. The above-mentioned tax increases can generate 107,000,000 pounds this year and 226,000,000 pounds for the whole year. The Chancellor concluded by saying that such huge numbers of revenue and expenditure should not be regarded as evidence of government abuse. In fact, all kinds of arrangements made since the outbreak of the war require funding, and the machinery of war is especially expensive. For example, a new type of aircraft costs three to seven times more than a similar one in 1918. The Ministry of Finance has agreed with the Ministry of Defense to invite qualified and experienced people from the business community to audit the various proposals for new expenditures, which are strictly in line with needs and finances.

<h3>Portugal Plans to Send Warships to Aid England and France</h3>
<p>London: The Portuguese government has maintained a friendly neutral attitude towards England in the current war. Because of the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union and the division of Poland, it is very angry and is said to be taking a hostile attitude towards Germany and taking various measures to aid England and France in the naval aspect. The country's main fleet, including twelve of the latest warships, has been concentrated in a certain place, and each naval base has also been replenished. The entire navy can be mobilized in the shortest possible time. If so, it can make a great contribution to preventing German submarine activities. It goes without saying that it is helpful to England and France. This is also more in line with Portuguese public opinion, because public opinion does not advocate sending an expeditionary force to France to help in the war, but would rather aid England and France in the naval aspect.

<h3>French Artillery Threatens Saarlouis; Report that German Troops Have Withdrawn; French Say Reconnaissance Units Absolutely Necessary for Large-Scale Activities</h3>
<p>Paris: According to French claims, the German troops in Saarlouis were unable to defend the town due to the intense artillery and machine-gun fire from the French, and have completely withdrawn. The French army has surrounded part of the city. It is expected that the German army will attempt to relieve the siege. It is also reported that the French army is seriously threatening Lebach, 30 miles east of Saarlouis, which is under "constant artillery fire." The German army between Lebach and Homburg is now quite uneasy, because the French army has occupied the Worringen spur that extends into German territory, and its ridge can control the Homburg River. German artillery has been bombarding the spur for several days. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to reliable sources, apart from artillery battles, there are no important military operations on the Rhine front. German troops are now concentrated in the three towns of Berre, Besch, and Bouche along the Moselle River. French artillery is constantly bombarding these places, preventing the German army from completing preparations for a general offensive. Since the outbreak of the war, the French authorities have avoided taking any adventurous actions, except for ordering reconnaissance teams to carry out reconnaissance in the area between the "Maginot Line" and the Siegfried Line, and have been taking steady and solid steps. Therefore, they have been able to attack the outposts of the Siegfried Line and achieve great success. So far, some losses are inevitable, but they are negligible. When the French army first entered German territory, the front of the German positions was covered with barbed wire, landmines, and various traps, and tank defense lines were built, with bunkers made of reinforced concrete and equipped with cannons and machine guns. All of these must be destroyed before they can advance. The French army first used artillery fire to destroy various fortifications and detonate landmines, then sent a platoon of soldiers as guides, followed by a regiment of soldiers, to advance to the enemy's positions under the cover of artillery fire. At the same time, they dispatched many infantrymen, carrying long sticks, to search for various suspicious objects along the way, such as tin cans and steel helmets, which are sufficient to hide explosives and fuses, and must be destroyed to ensure the safety of the advance. In addition, there is another method to detonate landmines, which is to use huge heavy-duty trucks, fully loaded with sandbags, and order them to advance slowly, while the drivers jump out in advance to pave the way for the infantry. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 47, which is very brief and only states that "our reconnaissance units on the front line are quite active." (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Capital of Switzerland: French and German aircraft have been active in the Kunz area on the border of Basel, Switzerland, more than twice in the past 24 hours. The first time, many French aircraft flew over the German defense line and were immediately fired upon by the German anti-aircraft artillery. The second time, many German aircraft flew to the French positions between the Rhine River and Siérenes, and the French anti-aircraft artillery bombarded them. Both air raids can be seen from the Swiss border. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris: Today's communique here stated that there was no major battle on the entire Western Front last night. The German army suffered a setback in an attack west of Saarlouis. Maritime commerce is now operating normally due to the completion of the naval and air force escort system. On September 27, British and French aircraft worked together to shoot down several German fighters. French reconnaissance aircraft were quite active at night. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Petit Parisien today detailed the air battles on the Western Front, stating that on September 24, five French fighters fought nine German fighters in the sky. As a result, two enemy planes were shot down, and soon two more caught fire and fell. One French plane was lost, and another crashed in its own territory. The pilot jumped out of the plane. It is said that the fifth German plane also crashed. On September 25, three French planes fought five German planes, and as a result, the Germans lost three of them, while the French only lost one. Of the other two German planes, one was hit and one escaped. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London: A military commentator today declared that although the Allied forces seemed to be moving slowly, Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin had not lost the initiative. It is still recalled that there were periods of silence of several weeks or months before and after major battles in the last European war. Today's situation is similar. If a rash attack is launched, it may create a dangerous salient that is easily attacked by the Germans and suffer adverse results. The Siegfried Line is specially designed to facilitate counterattacks on salients. The French authorities are now satisfied with the achievements they have already made. French artillery and infantry have leveled many German defenses and machine-gun nests, and consolidated the areas they have occupied. General Gamelin's strategy seems to be to force the Germans to reveal their plans. All parties admit that Germany will soon launch a major offensive, but it is not yet clear where it will start. At present, the Germans are deeply worried about the French occupation of the Homburg Heights, which are between Saarlouis and Wissembourg. Although the Germans often bombard it, they have failed to damage the French position. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday and last night, the British Air Force again flew into Germany and the Western Front for reconnaissance. Although they encountered resistance, they still brought back valuable information and safely returned to their original defense. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>The Defenders of Warsaw Submit Ceasefire Proposal; Speculation of City Surrender Today</h3>
<p>Paris: A communiqué from the Polish commander in Warsaw states that due to the extremely perilous situation of Warsaw's civilians, substantial material damage, severe water shortages, and the looming threat of epidemics, a 24-hour ceasefire has been proposed. Warsaw is now completely destroyed and continues to suffer relentless shelling. Water reservoirs and filtration plants are destroyed, making relief efforts difficult due to constant bombing. Memorials and churches are in ruins, none spared. No response to the proposal has been received. A previous communiqué stated that Warsaw shot down 13 German aircraft yesterday, totaling 108 German aircraft shot down. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command released a communiqué tonight, briefly stating that Warsaw has surrendered unconditionally and will formally surrender to the German High Command on the 29th of this month. The number of Polish soldiers stationed in Warsaw that can be currently confirmed is over 100,000. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin: General Göring issued an address to the Luftwaffe on the occasion of Warsaw's surrender. It stated that the Polish army had been defeated in a matter of days. The Polish Air Force also engaged effectively, but the German army prevailed with blitzkrieg tactics. He was proud of the Luftwaffe's collaborative operations. The Air Force, with decisive action, controlled enemy airspace from the start. Not a single Polish aircraft invaded German territory, ensuring the safety of the homeland. The advancing ground forces were also able to complete their great military mission. The German navy also received the assistance of the air force. The recklessly provocative Polish army has collapsed. The achievements of the German army are unprecedented in history. We bow in mourning to the fallen soldiers of the Air Force. The spirits of the Air Force martyrs remain with us. Their sacrifices place upon us a sacred duty. General Göring concluded by saying that when we fight for the freedom of Germany, I know we can rely on the Luftwaffe to strive for an eternal Germany. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Discusses Neutrality Act Amendment; Pittman Bitterly Complains of the Harm of the Arms Embargo; Senate Scheduled to Begin Debate on the 2nd of Next Month</h3>
<p>Washington: Regarding the Neutrality Act amendment, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently spoke with prominent Republicans, namely Senator Borah. They immediately agreed that the Foreign Relations Committee would meet tomorrow morning to discuss the Pittman amendment. Pittman later stated to a Havas reporter that his draft bill could be reviewed and passed by the Foreign Relations Committee with a majority of five or six votes and then submitted to the Senate for discussion. People in the Capitol lounge expect that the House of Representatives will wait until the Senate votes on the amendment before submitting it for discussion, but it can only express approval and cannot make any amendments. If it is indeed approved, the speakers of both houses will appoint several members to form a joint committee to consolidate the views of the two houses and draft another amendment for a vote in both houses. However, political figures expect that after the Senate passes the amendment, the House of Representatives need not discuss it and can approve it with a majority vote. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>New York: Senator Pittman, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave a radio address today, saying that as long as the arms embargo exists, the United States cannot maintain neutrality. We established this law because we wanted to prevent American ships from being attacked by submarines. The embargo prohibits the export of arms, ammunition, and implements of war. However, we now know that belligerent nations want to prevent not only what is stipulated by the American embargo from reaching enemy countries, but also what is not stipulated by the embargo. Those who oppose the repeal of this embargo believe that selling arms to belligerent nations is tantamount to participating in the massacre. But isn't the United States similarly participating in the massacre by allowing the export of gasoline for airplanes and scrap iron for bombs to Japan? As for the argument that repealing the embargo will greatly help England and France, there is currently no international law or other laws to interfere with the Soviet Union or Italy from transporting arms, ammunition, and implements of war to Poland. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington: Republican Senator Borah recently told reporters that, in his opinion, the Neutrality Act amendment drafted by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, could be reviewed and passed tomorrow and submitted to the Senate for discussion. People generally infer from this that the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee no longer oppose the Pittman amendment. The Senate may begin discussion on October 2, at which time, among the 96 senators, those in favor of repealing the arms embargo clause may account for a majority of 56. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington: Presidential Secretary O'Leary stated last night that President Roosevelt's amendment to the Neutrality Act is sure to pass. Senators supporting the president's proposal will broadcast on the radio to promote it to the public. Many letters supporting or opposing the amendment to the Neutrality Act have been sent to the senators. Congressional sources say that there are already 56 senators supporting the president's proposal. The proportion of people in the House of Representatives who support the president is even greater. The administration is not prepared to present any new proposals before the amendment to the Neutrality Act is passed. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: After the Neutrality Act amendment drafted by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is established, American aircraft will not be allowed to land in the territory of any belligerent nation. Pan American Airways, because it operates North Atlantic routes, will inevitably feel inconvenienced and has informed the State Department of this. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington: Debate on the US government's new Neutrality Act will begin in the Senate on October 2. Opposition leader Borah claims that if the Foreign Relations Committee extends the discussion, the opposition will have more time to study it. People expect that the committee will pass the bill soon. Those who generally support this bill now hold an optimistic view that the Senate can act quickly. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Pan-American Conference Holds Secret Meeting; Discusses the Delineation of Safe Zones; Cuban Proposal Receives Unanimous Approval</h3>
<p>Capital of Panama: The Pan-American Conference held a plenary secret meeting today. It is reported that the issue of delineating safe zones on both the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the American continent was discussed. Regarding this, the proposal put forward by Cuba has been unanimously endorsed in principle by the representatives of the participating countries. What is being studied now is only the technical issues. In addition, the lists of prohibited goods determined by the European belligerent nations, as well as the issue of freedom of commerce for neutral countries, were also submitted for discussion. The representative of Uruguay expressed a willingness to maintain trade relations with the neutral countries in Europe and advocated that various food raw materials and industrial products, that are not used for war, should be removed from the list of prohibited goods. The representatives of Chile and Argentina immediately endorsed this. In addition, there are more than fifty German ships currently in American territorial waters. The representatives of various countries at the conference believe that a swift resolution should be reached on how to deal with them. Among them, the representative of Chile advocated that they should be detained to offset the value of goods owed by Poland to the American countries. (Joint Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Panama: The representatives of Argentina and Uruguay proposed at the Pan-American Conference today that belligerent nations should not list food and clothing as prohibited goods. This proposal is aimed at the British blockade policy, because it violates international law and affects the trade of neutral countries. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Panama City: The US delegation has submitted to the Pan-American Conference a proposal for discussion that belligerent submarines should not be allowed to enter American ports and territorial waters, otherwise they will be detained. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Main Fleet in the North Sea Undergoes Bombing; German Side Claims Two British Ships Hit; British Side Claims Two German Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>London: First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill reported to the House of Commons this afternoon on the situation of the British main fleet being attacked by a squadron of German aircraft in the North Sea yesterday. He briefly stated that we did not suffer any damage, and two German aircraft were shot down. A destroyer was dispatched to capture four pilots. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the report by British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill that German aircraft bombing British warships in the North Sea never hit anything and that three aircraft were shot down, General Göring, Commander-in-Chief of the German Air Force, immediately issued a statement refuting this. It briefly stated that a British aircraft carrier was hit by a 500-kilogram bomb, and a main battleship was hit by two 250-kilogram bombs, hitting the front and middle parts. The destructive power of these bombs is self-evident. None of the German aircraft that dropped the bombs were hit by British ships and all safely flew back to base. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A German Air Force spokesman declared that the German Air Force's bombing of British warships in the North Sea should be regarded as having major significance, because although the Air Force had attacked submarines, the bombing of warships was still the first time. At the beginning of the war, British aircraft attempted to attack German naval bases, losing 50% of their aircraft. Therefore, the fact that the German Air Force damaged a British main battleship and destroyed an aircraft carrier in the North Sea is recorded in military history as the first time a warship was bombed by aircraft. Naval experts point out that Britain only has six aircraft carriers and two seaplane carriers, and the "Courageous" has already been sunk by a German submarine. German aircraft have also sunk a British aircraft carrier, and the current sinking of another is a major loss for Britain. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London: According to today's official statement, the German bombers that attacked the British fleet in the North Sea on Tuesday used low-hanging clouds to skim over British warships. Other aircraft flying above 12,000 feet also sometimes used gaps in the clouds to attack British cruisers. However, because the British fleet's defense was very effective, the German aircraft could not find their targets. At that time, the British fleet was protecting a slightly damaged British submarine returning to Britain. German aircraft took this opportunity to make ineffective attacks. As a result, two German aircraft were shot down, and at least one other was seriously damaged. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Guilin: The Chinese army northwest of Gao'an achieved a great victory. On the afternoon of the 27th, a certain Chinese unit recovered Hengqiao. At 4 pm, another Chinese unit recovered Ganfang, 20 li east of Hengqiao. The Japanese army retreated northward. On the same day at 3 pm, 300-400 Japanese troops counterattacked the Chinese forces that had recovered Shangfuzhen, resulting in fierce fighting. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Gao'an: The Chinese army in northern Jiangxi is now discussing the recovery of Luofang, Yecheng, and Shangfu. The Japanese army that had sneaked into Ganfang is being encircled by the Chinese army. After suffering a disastrous defeat northeast of Gao'an, the Japanese army gathered the remaining 2,000-plus men and invaded west from Fengxin, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese near Shangfu for several days. In order to annihilate the remaining Japanese forces, the Chinese lured the Japanese deep. The Chinese army in Luofang, Yecheng, Shangfu, and other places west of Fengxin successively advanced to nearby areas and launched fierce attacks. Starting on the 26th, a full-scale counterattack was launched. Although the Japanese army resisted, they were ultimately overwhelmed by the Chinese army's valiant advance and intense firepower, and they showed signs of collapse that evening. The Chinese army launched a night-long assault and finally recovered Luofang, Yecheng, and Shangfu successively at 9 am on the 27th. In addition to a portion that retreated to Fengxin, the rest fled into the nearby mountains, leaving corpses scattered everywhere and abandoning a large amount of military supplies. Their embarrassment was almost identical to the defeat at Gao'an. While wiping out the remaining Japanese forces, the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to quickly advance and besiege Ganfang Town. The Japanese army in that area, with their retreat cut off, was extremely panicked and released poison gas to stop the Chinese army's advance. The Chinese army, with high morale, took advantage of the victory to bravely break into the village in the afternoon and launch street fighting, which is currently underway. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Associated Press report</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Talks About the Possibility of the US Mediation of the War Being Relatively High; China's Foreign Policy Is Based on Treaties; Willing to Cooperate With All Friendly Countries</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to what Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui said to a reporter from the Associated Press, the National Government is determined to continue the war of resistance until it achieves final victory. As for China's foreign policy, there has been no change to date. China's foreign policy is entirely based on treaties, especially the Nine-Power Treaty, the most important of which is to ensure that these treaties that protect China's independence and integrity can be implemented. China is willing to cooperate economically with all countries that are friendly to China. If Japan can cooperate with us on a completely equal footing, then of course we can also cooperate with it economically. Unfortunately, Japan's so-called cooperation is in fact nothing more than wanting to control China. If so, then we have no possibility of cooperating with Japan. However, the Nine-Power Treaty and other treaties are not only respected by various countries, but also signed by Japan in 1922. Now Japan is brazenly disregarding everything and destroying them, so what other way can China take other than to exert all its strength to resist? Furthermore, in addition to being respected by the United States, Britain, and France, even the Soviet Union, which did not sign the treaty, is extremely concerned about the Nine-Power Treaty. Judging from Japan's current exhausted state, it is actually impossible to completely "subdue" China. Since the United States lodged a protest with Japan on December 31, 1938, for violating the Nine-Power Treaty, Britain and France also followed the United States and lodged protests. On the other hand, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, China and the Soviet Union immediately established a non-aggression treaty. Therefore, those surrounding Japan are all countries that oppose Japan's actions. What Japan can comfort itself with is an empty anti-Communist treaty, but as of today, even this anti-Communist treaty has been torn up by Germany. Therefore, today's Japan can be said to be in a state of absolute isolation. But before this, the United States had announced the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. If Japan still does not make a statement of respecting treaties, then the United States will refuse to enter into a new commercial treaty with Japan. The Japanese side is well aware of the importance of this point, so it is thinking about improving US-Japan relations. Nomura's appointment as Japanese Foreign Minister is aimed at establishing a new commercial treaty in Japan. Therefore, the position that the United States currently occupies is truly of great importance. In this situation, it is very easy for the United States to persuade the Japanese side to accept President Roosevelt's mediation. At the same time, it is also easy for Roosevelt to submit the proposal to the Japanese side. This proposal is a way for the Japanese side to end the "China Incident" and avoid moving towards destruction. At the same time, if peace is achieved at this time, it will also be in Japan's interest, because if Japan does not fight against China during this European war, it can greatly expand its foreign trade. Therefore, if President Roosevelt comes forward to mediate at this time, the possibility of success will be high. The reporter then asked Wang about the peace terms recently spread among Chinese people in Chongqing and Hong Kong. According to the information obtained from that side, if the Japanese side can provide reliable guarantees for troop withdrawal and guarantee that the speed of troop withdrawal can be in accordance with the opinions of neutral military experts, then the National Government may order the soldiers in all war zones to stop attacking the Japanese army. When the Japanese army withdraws, the Chinese army will follow and reoccupy the locations withdrawn by the Japanese side. After this work is completed, the Chinese people can regain their territory, and the Japanese workers and peasants can return to their country to rebuild their old careers. Because of his position as Foreign Minister, Dr. Wang was unwilling to criticize these speculative peace terms, but he expressed his personal opinion that the National Government could accept such terms.

<h3>The Island of Meizhou off the Coast of Fujian Has Been Recovered</h3>
<p>Fuzhou: The island of Meizhou off the coast of Putian and Huian was previously occupied by the Japanese, and the Japanese forces declared a blockade of the waterway there. Yesterday, Chinese naval commando units took advantage of the Mid-Autumn Festival moonlight to cross the sea in small boats and directly attacked the Japanese lair. The Japanese were caught off guard and more than ten were killed by the Chinese army, and two were captured alive. Four hundred bags of wheat flour were seized. The remaining Japanese forces fled in panic and escaped into the sea. The island was completely recovered this morning. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Twelve Japanese aircraft flew to Chongqing from western Hubei tonight and attacked Chongqing city. Although the sky was dark and cloudy, the Japanese aircraft still flew recklessly westward and then entered the suburbs of Chongqing. After blindly dropping bombs, they returned east along the river. The Chinese air defense forces had been closely prepared, so the Japanese aircraft were unable to sneak into the city's airspace. However, the air raid alarm was issued by the air defense command here for an hour before being lifted. (28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: At 7:30 tonight, Japanese aircraft were discovered flying towards here, and an alarm was immediately issued. Chinese fighter aircraft took off to patrol. Soon, twelve Japanese bombers, divided into two groups, dropped bombs in the eastern suburbs. The city was not affected. The alarm was lifted at 8:45. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Suspension of Traffic Between Hanoi and Kunming</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The railway between Hanoi and Kunming has been temporarily suspended from September 26th due to the impact of heavy rain. Five sections of the railway line have been washed away, and seven miles of roadbed have also been damaged. It is reported that the sections near Gaojie Tie Shu and Xujia Du station in Southeastern Yunnan were the most severely damaged.  According to news from Kunming, the area and surrounding districts are in danger of flooding. Seventy-six hours of heavy rain has caused the rivers around Kunming to rise. Eastern Kunming is now threatened by flooding, and nearby roads and villages are submerged. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>French Currency Circulation in Tianjin as Usual</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tianjin News - The circulation of French currency in Tianjin has been undermined by the Japanese. A few merchants in the concessions have refused to accept it. The British and French authorities have reported arresting over ten people who refused to use it. This shows that the concessions are still maintaining the French currency. The currency has been circulating as usual in recent days. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Fishermen Appeal to Government for Protection</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Since the end of August, over eighty Chinese fishing boats have been burned by Japanese warships, and five hundred fishermen have suffered. Representatives of the Hong Kong Fishermen's Association visited the Secretary for Chinese Affairs on the 27th, requesting protection. The Secretary expressed deep regret, stating that the authorities intend to negotiate with Japan and hope that such incidents will not occur again. He also said that British naval forces will provide protection to fishing boats fishing within three miles of British territorial waters. (Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Armed Japanese Search Tianjin Associated Press</h3>
<p>Tianjin: The Tianjin office of the Associated Press and the American Wireless Radio Station were suddenly searched by plainclothes Japanese military police this morning. The British and American authorities here have been asked to investigate the situation so that appropriate measures can be taken. According to explanations from the British Concession Police Department, the British side had allowed Japanese military police to search for "anti-Japanese elements" at 142 Yingzhong Street (i.e., Third Road) without knowing that the Associated Press and the American Wireless Radio Station were located in that building. The British police authorities also stated that the British side had initially only permitted two Japanese personnel to enter the premises, but the actual number of Japanese exceeded the agreed limit. It is understood that the Japanese search area extends throughout the British Concession and has not been completed as of 12:00 noon today. According to Japanese claims, several anti-Japanese elements within the concession have been arrested. It is clear that the British police authorities have implicitly allowed Japanese personnel to arrest Chinese people whom they consider "anti-Japanese." Furthermore, although the owner of the American Wireless Radio Station, Mr. Nicoll, was threatened with a pistol, he ultimately prevented the Japanese from taking away telegrams. It is said that most of these wireless telegrams belong to American businesses here. This wireless radio station was specifically authorized by the British Concession authorities. Since the telegrams transmitted and received by the station are not subject to Japanese inspection, foreign merchants here are very pleased. (Associated Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: This morning, the British and French Concession authorities granted the Japanese request to conduct a joint search within the concessions. The American-owned Pentreath Wireless Radio Station was also invaded. It is said that this was due to an incorrect address. After discovering the error, the Japanese military police immediately ordered the searchers to withdraw. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Intense Fighting Near Chaozhou and Shantou; Japanese Attempt to Attack Huiyang; Landings at Renshan and Xia Yong; Strong Chinese Defenses</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondent: Since September, the war situation in eastern Guangdong has entered a new stage where the Chinese army has taken the initiative, turning defense into offense. Along the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway, they have fully demonstrated new tactics. Over the past three months, they have repeatedly attacked Chaoan City six times and Chenghai City three times. The Chinese army has strategically abandoned these locations on its own, avoiding large-scale positional battles with the Japanese army. They seize and abandon the strongholds along the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway, taking away ammunition, supplies, and provisions before abandoning them.</p>
<p>Japanese Concentrate Reinforcements in Chaozhou and Shantou</p>
<p>From September 6th to 12th, the Japanese army transferred units stationed on Hainan Island, Zhou Island, Nanpeng Island, Nanao Island, and along the coast to reinforce Chaozhou and Shantou. Judging from their actual strength, they still cannot exceed 8,000 men, barely enough to compensate for casualties. The newly arrived troops advanced towards Jieyang, and Qian Gang and Jiao Tang along the Tuo River tributary were occupied by the Taiwan Garrison Command on the 11th. This tributary is south of Sangpu Mountain and can reach Qu Xi and Feng Kou in Jieyang, or bypass Jin Gou, Yu Jiao, and Da Zhai, and Qi Tou, flanking the Chinese positions on the Anjie Road, coordinating with the Japanese forces in Fuyang, Wuyang, Guan Chao, and Jinshi City to attack the guerrilla base on Sangpu Mountain from both sides. The Chinese assault force is divided into three routes: the main force on the Anjie Road front, the right wing moving down the Han River from Fengshun Tiandong Xu, Shangxia Ronggui Lake, attacking the Zhugao Mountain and Yixi Station, and the Bijiashan head of Dongjin Bridge, and the left wing using Sangpu Mountain as a base to attack Anbu and Caitang.  The regular army, Chen Kan and Liang Huasheng's divisions, support these three routes. Hua Zhenzhong's brigade and Zou Hong's security regiment, along with local militias, serve as the vanguard. As for Raoping and Chenghai, located in the rear, elite troops are stationed to defend Longdu, Lianhua Mountain, Zhanglin, Donglong, Yanzao, Huanggang, and Zhalin, implementing a scorched earth policy, setting up defenses across the river. Chenghai City is very close to Anbu, Ou Ting, and Shangpeng, only thirty li from Shantou, and has become a buffer zone between the two sides. Because there is no natural defense, neither side stations large forces there.</p>
<p>Chinese Forces Attack Chaoan</p>
<p>On September 11th, the Chinese army withdrew from Chaoan City, and the Japanese army redeployed outside the northwest gate, cutting off communication between the city and the surrounding villages, searching house to house for hidden guerrillas. Five to six hundred farmers were arrested in the villages, either imprisoned or forced to work. One to two hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry troops explored the outskirts of the city. On the morning of the 13th, Japanese troops from Chaozhou, using three tanks, led infantry and cavalry to advance towards Fengxi and Fuyang. Chen's company of the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade, stationed at Fuyang Station, seeing the fierce advance of the Japanese army, retreated to the Wuyang Mountain positions at 10:00 AM. Two Japanese aircraft dropped over ten bombs on Wuyang. The Chinese army then shifted to defend Qingmao Mountain, holding the Anjie Road front near Fengxi and Fengling. Fierce fighting broke out on the afternoon of the 13th, and the Japanese army was defeated. Rongzao, the porcelain production area of Chaozhou, was 80% destroyed by bombs. Bowl and plate production will depend entirely on Gao Bei, Dapu from now on. Anbu was recaptured by the Chinese army on the 13th. The Japanese army lost Anbu twice in September, suffering over 500 casualties and losing hundreds of loads of military supplies, guns, and ammunition. On the morning of the 13th, reinforcements arrived from Shantou, attacking Sangpu Mountain from three routes: Yuepu, Pengzhou Suo, and Dajing Meixitou. Chinese guerrilla and security forces were scattered in Shaxi, Hongan, Caitang, Hailian Mountain, Wuta Gang, with dispersed targets. Over 400 Japanese troops first gathered at Longxi Middle School in Anbu and were immediately surrounded by Chinese guerrillas from all sides. In the afternoon, the Japanese suffered 50 to 60 casualties and retreated to the station to hold their ground. The Japanese troops attacking Sangpu Mountain dared not advance further due to fighting behind their lines. At this time, Zou Hong, the commander of the Huichao-Mei Garrison, had moved his headquarters to Liuhuang Mountain in Fengshun to coordinate the attack on Chaozhou. Wu Qiwai established the forward command post of the Ninth Group Army at Jieyang Xi Chang and Maya Du. Hua Zhenzhong's Chaozhou-Shantou Garrison Headquarters moved to Sangpu Mountain. Large forces from Xingning and Wuhua moved towards Chaoan in an endless stream.</p>
<p>Japanese Attempt to Attack Huiyang</p>
<p>On the night of the 12th, over a thousand fresh Chinese troops descended eastwards by bamboo raft from Liulong, launching a fierce attack on Zhugao Mountain, Yixi Station, and besieging Bijiashan at the Dongyang dike bridge in Guihu and Caijiayuan. These two places are six li northeast of Chao City, separated by a river. That night, the Japanese army, unsure of the real situation, dared not send reinforcements. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered over 200 casualties and retreated back into the city. On the 13th, the Chinese army completely occupied Yixi Bridge, and the city was in chaos. The sound of artillery fire was thunderous outside the city, and shells rained down on Jinshan and Hulu Mountain. The Chinese army had already charged to the outside of the northwest gate. The Japanese command frantically moved boxes out of the east gate and onto motorboats. Chaozhou and Shantou were surrounded on all sides. Having suffered defeats in Chaozhou and Shantou, the Japanese turned their aggression to the coast of Haifeng, Shanwei, and Daya Bay in Huiyang. It is reported that landings have also occurred at Renshan and Xia Yong, with plans to directly approach Danshui and attack Huiyang. On the 13th, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs along the Dong River, and the towns and markets along the river were evacuated automatically. The departure times of boats and vehicles were changed to nighttime. Xingning and Meixian also opened night markets, with few pedestrians during the day. This is a sign that the Japanese are shifting their invasion to the Dong River. The Chinese military authorities have already made careful arrangements in the mountains of Zijin, Haifeng, and Lufeng. Since the spring, the militia of each county has been voluntarily entering the mountains for training. Even if coastal villages are lost, it will not have much impact on the military strategy.</p>
<h3>Smooth Cargo Transport Between Hong Kong and Vietnam; Haiphong Customs Builds More Warehouses; More Vehicles Being Planned</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondent: In the last six months, the shipping business between Hong Kong and Haiphong has developed rapidly. To adapt to the environment, the number of ships traveling the Hong Kong-Haiphong line has increased to over thirty. The reason is that after the fall of Guangzhou, most import and export goods were rerouted through Haiphong, which has gradually become the central hub for import and export goods. In recent months, the cargo volume on this line has not decreased despite the increase in the number of ships and the rise in freight rates. The goods transported from Vietnam to Hong Kong are mostly local products such as tung oil, tin, medicinal materials, minerals, and other miscellaneous goods.</p>
<p>Due to the congestion of cargo, the warehouses in Haiphong are insufficient. The congestion of goods in warehouses is similar to that of shipping. As a result, goods shipped from Hong Kong to Haiphong often cannot find a fixed warehouse for storage upon arrival. Most of the goods have to be stored in the open space near the customs, where they are easily damaged by rain and sun. The customs has partially restricted the import of goods to reduce congestion, causing great difficulties for both customers and shipping companies. It is understood that recently, the British companies Taikoo and Jardine sent two ships to Haiphong as lighters for storing goods. However, due to the small size of the ships and the large amount of cargo, it is still difficult to solve the above problems. In view of the congestion of cargo, the customs has</p>
<p>Built More Warehouses</p>
<p>Most have been completed. Various transportation companies have registered with the customs in advance to store goods on behalf of customers. Shanghai Hongyun Shipping Bureau, Weitai Bank, and various customs brokers have registered warehouses with Haiphong Customs. Jardine Matheson has recently dispatched a ship to Haiphong as a lighter. The ship has sailed directly from Hong Kong to Haiphong a few days ago. At the same time, companies are also working hard to increase the number of vehicles on the highway from Haiphong to the mainland. Therefore, it is expected that the congestion of cargo transport between Hong Kong and Vietnam will be improved in the short term. It is reported that the water and land freight rates in Haiphong have increased several times, but merchants do not find it difficult. They only hope that the goods can be transported and delivered as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in Prices of Eastern Zhejiang Silk</h3>
<p>Yongkang Correspondent: This year's price of local silk in Zhejiang Province once soared, then fell to about 45 yuan per hundred taels. Later, because the local silk traders in the guerrilla areas of western Zhejiang were heavily suppressed by the puppet regime, who collected a "unified tax" of 30% and purchased the silk with puppet currency, the silk traders suffered heavy losses and all automatically imported the silk into eastern Zhejiang. Moreover, Su and Wan Province, including Yixing, Liyang, Guangde, Qingyang, and other counties, had a bumper harvest of spring cocoons this year, and the accumulated silk, totaling more than 3,000 dan, was also transported to Zhejiang for sale, resulting in an oversupply in the local silk market in eastern Zhejiang. Recently, due to the outbreak of the European War, the sales of local silk in Shanghai were suddenly affected, and the price fell sharply. According to reliable sources, the average price of local silk in Shaoxing and Huashe has fallen to about 37 yuan per hundred taels, and the influx of goods is still surging, so the price is expected to continue to fall.</p>
<h3>Exhaustion of the Japanese Invading Army - Japanese Casualties and Sickness Increasing Daily - Plan to Implement Control in Shantou Has Failed</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondent: It has been nearly three months since Chaozhou and Shantou fell into enemy hands. The Chinese and Japanese armies are locked in a seesaw battle along the railway. Observing the Japanese troops at various strongholds, their equipment is incomplete, their uniforms are disheveled, and their morale is low. According to a translator in the Japanese propaganda team (originally from Jiaoling County, Guangdong Province, residing in Taiwan, having acquired Taiwanese citizenship, and forced to come to China to participate in the invasion; when leaving Taiwan, five families were jointly responsible, and if he escaped en route, all five families would be executed), the Japanese military strictly controls news in Japan and Taiwan. The number of troops sent and the number of casualties are unknown to anyone. However, it is known that every family has men serving in the army, and since the year before last, none have been discharged and returned home. Before the "July 7th" Incident, the Japanese army had a total of 25 divisions, from the 1st to the 25th, plus a Guards Division. When the Battle of Shanghai began, 26 divisions were fighting in China. By the time of the fall of Nanjing and the Battle of Xuzhou, reserve divisions had already been mobilized to participate (i.e., the 101st to 125th Divisions). When the Chinese army shifted its positions to defend Wuhan, Japan again greatly expanded its army, formally expanding the divisions to 35 and also expanding the reserve divisions to 35, totaling 70 divisions. The locations of the Japanese army are roughly as follows: (1) 15 divisions stationed in the Northeast (Korea) to defend against Russia; (2) 15 divisions stationed in North China (10 divisions in Shanxi, 1 division each on the PingSui, PingHan, and JinPu lines, and 1 division each in Hebei and Shandong); (3) 15 divisions in Central China (5 divisions at the intersection of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, 3 divisions at the intersection of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, 2 divisions along the Yangtze River, 3 divisions in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, and 2 divisions in Shanghai and its vicinity); (4) 5 divisions in South China (3.5 divisions in Guangzhou, a total of 1 division in Shantou and Qiongya, and half a division on the coastal islands). In total, the Japanese army has 50 divisions stationed in China, but each division is severely understaffed. On average, each division with four regiments and two battalions has roughly 16,000 to 20,000 men. The fighting strength is five percent worse than during the Battle of Xuzhou. In terms of quality, it is even more different compared to before the Battle of Wuhan. The offensive efficiency and firepower have dropped to 50%, and they can no longer exert the power of the "August 13th" Incident. Japanese veteran military men often sigh among themselves that things are getting worse and worse. To defeat the main force of the Chinese army and end the incident, the effect obtained is a futile dream in history. The first phase of the three major battles (Shanghai, Xuzhou, Wuhan) has shown that the Chinese fighting power is getting stronger and stronger. The number of Japanese soldiers killed, wounded, and dying from disease is increasing daily, gradually to the point where they have no further offensive power. Even to defend the strongholds and major cities requires all their strength and a huge price to be able to sleep soundly for one night. To revive the market and develop industry is almost impossible under the military stalemate.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Japanese occupation of Shantou, they had already drafted a plan to restore the railway, water, and electricity companies and merge them into the Fuda Company for operation. When the Bank of Taiwan reopened in Shantou on July 15, it had a extravagant hope for economic control, wanting to grasp the financial power in one hand. Every year, overseas Chinese in Nanyang remit 60 to 70 million yuan, and they planned to absorb it all into the bank and issue military scrip to the families of overseas Chinese. However, the facts before them have shattered these fantasies. (1) The tracks of the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway continue to be demolished by guerrillas, and even the sleepers cannot be placed on the roadbed. It is impossible to run trains, so the Japanese simply converted it into a highway for cars. (2) The electricity and water supply have been repaired by engineers sent by the Japanese, but without huge capital to replace the machines, they cannot be used. (3) Within three months of Shantou's fall, not a single cargo or passenger has been imported, and industry and commerce have come to a standstill, turning it into a dead city. Those who have not fled are limited to buying two jiao worth of white rice (not enough for one catty) per person per day. Nearby villages also lack rice, and some walk, take boats, and travel twenty to thirty li to Shantou to buy rice, only able to buy a little to prolong their lives. The prosperity of the Shantou market is only found in the gambling houses and stalls in the alleys and the large hotels and restaurants occupied as brothels and opium dens. Pushing it to Zhi Ping Road, Sheng Ping Road, Ju Ping Road, and Zhen Ping Road, the faces of all the shops and silver houses have completely changed, with gambling houses every five steps and opium dens every ten steps.</p>
<h3>Salt City Repeatedly Bombed</h3>
<p>With the Communication, at 10:30 a.m. on the 22nd, two Japanese seaplanes and one bomber circled over Yancheng for seven or eight weeks, dropping one incendiary bomb, which landed in the city and set several houses on fire. They then strafed with machine guns before retreating after forty minutes. At 8:40 a.m. on the 23rd, two Japanese planes took off from Sheyang Lake and circled over Yancheng for reconnaissance. Soon after, four more planes came, divided into three groups, and strafed with machine guns for fifty minutes. Later, three more planes came from Dongtai and dropped nine bombs, all of which landed in the villages and towns near the city, causing minimal damage.</p>

<h3>Establishment of Teachers' Association for Charity Schools of the Refugee Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association sponsors more than 40 charity schools. In order to promote charity education and connect feelings, the teachers of these charity schools initiated the organization of a Charity School Teachers' Association. A general meeting was held on September 8, and Xu Xingzheng, Hu Dongtian, Hu Liang, Zhang Jinpei, Yun Laiyi, and 13 others were elected as directors. On September 21, they submitted an application to the education department of the association for recordation.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province: Raising Teachers' Salaries</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou Correspondence) In Fujian Province, the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers have always been meager. Since the reduction of educational funds began two years ago, the amount has become even lower, leading many excellent teachers to resign due to financial difficulties, creating instability in education. To improve wartime education efficiency, the provincial government has specifically enacted and implemented a method for determining the salaries of principals, teachers, and staff in secondary schools. According to this method, the minimum monthly salary for a high school principal is 150 yuan, and the maximum is 260 yuan, with nine salary grades. Salaries increase by 10 yuan per grade below 200 yuan and by 20 yuan per grade above 200 yuan. The minimum monthly salary for a high school teacher is 100 yuan, and the maximum is 180 yuan, with nine salary grades, increasing by 10 yuan per grade. The minimum monthly salary for a clerk is 20 yuan, and the maximum is 60 yuan, with nine salary grades, increasing by 5 yuan per grade. The minimum monthly salary for a junior high school principal is 120 yuan, and the maximum is 200 yuan, with nine salary grades, increasing by 10 yuan per grade. The minimum monthly salary for a junior high school teacher is 80 yuan, and the maximum is 180 yuan, with nine salary grades, increasing by 10 yuan per grade. The salary for clerks is the same as in high schools. Regulations for establishing salary standards for teachers and staff have also been stipulated. For the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the average number of classes in each provincial secondary school should be used as the basis for calculating salaries. The average monthly salary for principals of senior high schools, normal schools, and senior vocational schools is 200 yuan per person. The average monthly salary for full-time teachers is 140 yuan per person. The average monthly salary for principals of junior high schools, simplified normal schools, and junior vocational schools is 170 yuan per person. The average monthly salary for full-time teachers is 120 yuan per person. The average monthly salary for clerks is 40 yuan per person. The total monthly increase in funding is 80 yuan. From August to December, the total increase in funding is 40,000 yuan, allocated from the provincial treasury. The salaries of primary school teachers in various counties and districts are even lower, far below the monthly salaries of the lowest-ranking civil servants in administrative organs, with most earning between 12 and 15 yuan per month. The Education Department, under Liu, has previously established rules for the appointment, service, and rewards and punishments of primary school teachers and staff in various counties and districts. However, most counties and districts have been unable to implement them due to financial difficulties, resulting in most excellent primary school teachers changing careers, and current teachers being unable to serve with peace of mind. Relief measures are urgently needed. The current temporary provincial assembly also believes that it is necessary to increase funding for primary education in various counties and districts and that the salaries of primary school teachers should be raised. The Education Department is actively handling the registration and assessment of primary school teachers throughout the province, which will be completed soon. In the future, all qualified personnel, whether newly employed or currently serving, should receive a minimum monthly salary of 20 yuan. Those already serving should receive a minimum of 24 yuan. Counties and districts where primary school teachers' monthly salaries do not meet these standards should raise funds to reach these standards. Those that have already reached these standards should still find ways to raise them further to promote the development of local education. (August 9)</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Subsidizes Chinese Private Schools; The Third Tranche of Educational Funds to be Issued Next Month</h3>
<p>In view of the increase in the number of Chinese schools in the Public Concession after the war, and the fact that most schools are experiencing a shortage of educational funds and are unable to maintain operations, the Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is increasing its funding for Chinese private schools this year from 160,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan, to support the continued promotion of Chinese education. The funds will be distributed in four tranches. The first and second tranches have already been distributed to the approved schools. It is now known that the third tranche of subsidies, totaling over 50,000 yuan, will be issued next month.</p>

<h3>Finance; British and American Exchange Rates Hover with a Relaxed Tone</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, the HSBC posted rates without any change. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange rates, the exchange rate of US dollars against British pounds rose by 6.25 points during the holiday, returning to the 4 yuan level. Therefore, the domestic market opened with a weaker tone for American dollars and a stable tone for British pounds. British pounds were at 4/28123, and American dollars were at 7.125 yuan. Money changers first bought in, and American banks were more willing to supply. After the opening, Sassoon, a British company, bought in, causing the rate to stabilize. British banks continued to release profits, and Hong Kong Electric also sold (to invest in gold). Subsequently, due to frequent sell orders from overseas, Hong Kong, and other regions, coupled with the fact that Chinese speculators were approaching the end of the month settlement period and the swap rates for September and October were high, they also began to close positions, leading to a weakening tone. British pounds were difficult to sell at 4/34375, and American dollars were at 7.28125 yuan. The downward trend stopped at noon and became stable. In the afternoon, the supply from British and American banks was very good, briefly strengthening the rates before returning to stable levels. As a result, British pounds closed at 4/3125, and American dollars closed at 7.21875 yuan, with British pounds slightly weaker by 0.03125 compared to before the holiday, and American dollars stronger by 0.125. The futures for this month were the same as the spot rates, but the futures for October for British pounds were also similar to the spot rates. However, because speculators generally adopted a buying attitude towards US dollars since the outbreak of the European war, and because the September settlement was approaching, those who did not have the financial strength to take delivery were unwilling to sell, so they had to swap, resulting in a slightly weaker tone. In the end, it only eased by 0.0625, so the dollar swap spread widened further, already reaching 1.875 points at the closing, with the combined monthly interest (excluding commissions) increasing to over 2.6%. It was reported that foreign banks were even willing to offer US$1.5625, but most wealthy merchants believed that interest rates would continue to rise, so few took the offer that day. Trading volume for spot and futures was robust in the morning and declined in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Sassoon Selling from Hong Kong</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's large orders were stable for both near and far terms. Silver prices in New York collectively contracted by 2 points. The price of raw gold in London was not fixed. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai, and France were all stable. US dollars against British pounds rose by 6.25 points, Shanghai rose by 1 jiao, and France rose by 1 fen. The above were all rolled over from before the holiday. The central bank's posted exchange rates remained the same. At the opening of the morning, the selling price of spot goods at banks was 4/28125 for British pounds and 7.125 for American dollars, which was stable for British pounds and 0.03125 weaker for American dollars compared to Monday, due to the increase in the exchange rate. Although Chinese money changers bought in after the opening, foreign banks, such as a certain favorable bank in North China, were quite willing to sell, so the market situation was extremely stable. It is estimated that a certain favorable bank in North China sold spot American dollars to Chinese money changers for 7.125 and 1875. HSBC's posted exchange rates were announced as unchanged, and the announcement of the silver balance tax also showed no increase or decrease. Afterwards, the Western company Sassoon slightly bought in, but foreign banks still had the willingness to supply, so it was not affected. It is estimated that Sassoon settled spot British pounds from foreign banks such as the Netherlands, North China, and Favorable for 4/3125, and spot American dollars for 7.1875 and 125. Then, the Chinese cotton yarn group suddenly liquidated the _ _ month American dollars, and the foreign electric Hong Kong also sold out, so the situation became slightly stronger. It is estimated that the cotton yarn group sold the _ _ month American dollars to Datong for 7.21875 and 25. Following this, Hong Kong Electric sold spot British pounds to a certain favorable bank in North China and other foreign banks for 4/3125 and 34375, and spot American dollars for 7.25 and 28125. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 4/3125 for British pounds and 7.21875 for American dollars, which was 0.03125 weaker for British pounds and 0.09375 stronger for American dollars compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>The American Dollar Swap Spread Widens Further</p>
<p>The market state in the later market was extremely quiet, and the trend was still slightly strong. It was heard that a certain favorable bank would sell spot American dollars to the same bank for 7.21875 and 25, and spot British pounds for 4/3125 and 328125. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was 4/3125 for British pounds and 7.21875 for American dollars, the same as this month. October British pounds were 4/265625, and American dollars were 7.03125. As a result, compared to before the holiday, both spot and monthly British pounds were 0.03125 weaker, and American dollars were all 0.125 stronger. October British pounds were also 0.03125 cheaper, while American dollars were 0.0625 higher.</p>

<h3>Gold Price and Exchange Rate Diverge; Hong Kong Group Forcefully Buys Gold; Transactions Total 3,000 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the unofficial market for cash gold bars, although the exchange rate was stable and slightly strengthened, the gold price rose divergently. However, the fluctuation range that day was not as strong as before the holiday. It was said that a certain gold store sold at high prices (reportedly to convert to foreign exchange), and the Hong Kong group took advantage of the low prices to forcefully buy (because the gold price in Hong Kong was about 400 yuan higher than the gold price in Shanghai), purchasing a considerable amount throughout the day. The general trend was slightly weak at the beginning, then stable, and then hovered. After the low price of 4,095 yuan at the opening in the morning, the price was pushed up to a peak of 4,147 yuan at noon by a certain money changer on behalf of the Hong Kong group. After the opening in the afternoon, a certain cash store forcefully sold, pushing the price down slightly to 4,110 yuan. Later, the Hong Kong group pulled the price up to 4,145 yuan. After entering, a certain gold store pushed the price down again to 4,115 yuan. However, the price ultimately closed at 4,123 yuan, an increase of 18 yuan compared to before the holiday. After the closing, the trend was raised again to the border of 4,130 yuan due to the Hong Kong group's continued purchase. Transactions were brisk throughout the day, totaling about 3,000 taels. The price of silver jewelry in jewelry stores was raised by 5 yuan. The price of customs gold remained fixed and unchanged.</p>
<p>Hired Gold Rises Very Little</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (10 taels), the market seemed slightly weaker due to the heard that the exchange rate was slightly stronger. The market opened 10 yuan lower than the closing price on Monday. A certain gold store sold 50 taels to a money changer for 4,095 yuan. After the opening, the Hong Kong group's buying intentions were strong, and a certain money changer was entrusted to buy forcefully. Another money changer and a certain cash store also bought on behalf of customers. The market immediately turned prosperous, and the price soon rose by 50 yuan. A money changer bought 30 taels for the jewelry store group for 4,145 yuan. Then, as the exchange rate weakened, the customer's buying intentions became sluggish, and a certain gold store and jewelry store group eagerly sold, causing the price to fall by 35 yuan. A certain number of taels were sold to a money changer for 4,110 yuan. After this, the securities group suddenly bought forcefully, and money changers also engaged in buying, stopping the downward trend and rising by 37 yuan. Money changers traded 50 taels with each other for 4,147 yuan. Near noon, a certain gold store sold again, and the situation slightly declined, soon falling back by 7 yuan. A certain number of taels were sold by a certain gold store to a money changer for 4,140 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the market opened lower by 30 yuan because a certain cash store had a strong selling intention and lacked support. A certain cash store sold 30 taels to a money changer for 4,110 yuan. After the opening, a certain money changer acted on behalf of the Hong Kong group to buy forcefully again. Although a certain cash store still had the intention to sell, their financial strength could not match. The price soon rose back by 35 yuan. A money changer bought 20 taels for the jewelry store group. When the price was 4,145 yuan, a certain gold store suddenly revived the selling trend and tirelessly sold at high prices, causing the price to fall again by 30 yuan. A money changer gave a certain silver number 20 taels, for the sake of hoping for a thousand one hundred and fifteen yuan. Afterwards, a certain money changer came again to pull up the price, and they were raised by eight yuan. The money changer acquired a Yuhao securities group for a total of 50 taels, with 4,123 yuan serving as the night closing price. As a result, before the fake roll rose by 18 yuan, it was heard that a money changer had received fifty taels from a gold store, amounting to 4,128 yuan. The price ranged from fifty-two yuan throughout the day, and the selling price of the gold sign from the cash shop was ten yuan higher than that of Hida, and the revenue had to be reduced by more than thirty yuan, and the current bid gold was still fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and the transaction was fresh.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold At Four Hundred And Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the large banks still suspended at 415 yuan for the sale of silver buildings, with a price change of five yuan at 9:50, and there were no further changes after that. It is estimated that Daheng Bank still had 420 yuan, and the new banks had the same price as the previous price, and all revenue had to be reduced by about twenty yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities; Domestic Debt Slightly Weak, Foreign Stocks with Strong Buying Interest</h3>
<p>Securities unofficial market reopened yesterday after the Autumn Festival holiday. The war in Hunan was intense, and there was no hope for the end of the European war. Market sentiment lacked excitement, and large holders slowly sold out. However, the large part was still being held, so the market price gradually decreased. When the market opened yesterday, the market price was weak due to the congestion of sellers. Later, because large holders were also seeking to sell, Grade C broke the 5 yuan mark, and Grade D and E also broke the 4 yuan mark. No. 38 always sold out, and Xingyuan, Yongkang, and Dafeng all sold a considerable amount. The only buyers were Hongkang and Lianhe who had a slight appetite, and Yizhong also bought in. As a result, the market price was down by 0.7 to 0.85 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stocks, Chinese Commercial Securities Stock, 40 shares traded, priced at 25.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the Chamber of Commerce reported that yesterday the stock market was very激昂, various industrial stocks had an unusually strong buying interest, and the stock涨风was烈in the shipping industry company aspect.

However, there is no special reason to follow the漲風this kind of arrival. Rubber stocks were relatively quiet, and prices were firm. Near the close of the market, due to profit-taking, the prices of each stock retraced slightly.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Dispatch) Today's listed prices of Far East company stocks, bank stocks fell again, McGallie Bank stock fell 5 shillings, to 6 pounds 5 shillings, HSBC bank stock, fell 1 pound each, priced at 72 pounds, the rest were steady.</p>

<h3>Buy for Fear of Rubber; -To Pay Interim Dividend-</h3>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Peak Season Approaching its End; Speculators Switching to Purchase of Coarse Yarn; 10-count Yarn Rises by 10 to 20 Yuan; 20-count Yarn Drops by 5 to 6 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, with a trend appearing to be indecisive. Actual transactions are too few, and people's minds are still firm. Because raw cotton is not loose, and factory costs are a factor, they are also unwilling to concede on opening prices. Thus, a stalemate has formed. However, the market situation for 10-count coarse yarn is turning towards higher prices, and transactions have increased in volume. In reality, the value is cheaper than 20-count yarn. Ordinary operators would rather collect coarse yarn than buy fine yarn to speculate on; the risk is lower, and since the season is still in its peak period, the hope of profit is relatively greater. This situation was reported in this newspaper earlier. Therefore, although fine yarn was sluggish today, coarse yarn saw an increase instead. Given this situation, the price difference between 20-count and 10-count yarn can be expected to narrow.</p>
<p>The morning opening for current yarn saw fellow traders gathering, and most were hesitant to move. Because there was no real demand for purchases, progress was slow. By 9:50 AM, the opening price had still not been set. However, there were transactions in 10-count coarse yarn from Tianjin dealers, with a few bales traded at high prices. Then, the single opening price for 20-count Double Horse brand yarn from the warehouse was flat, and the spot price fell instead. The intermediary market was very slight. However, there was still no improvement in sales to customers. Until the market closed, it was still mediocre. It was found that 1,845 bales were traded in half a day. The market price for 20-count Double Horse fell by 5 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell by 6 yuan, and Double Globe fell by 6 yuan. However, 10-count coarse yarn rose by 10 to 20 yuan. Wing On Factory opened with 700 bales of 10-count Special Golden City brand, priced at 650 yuan, with same-day payment. The amount purchased by each dealer is as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 560 Fellow Traders 905</p>
<p>Inland 360 Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Xiamen 10 Total 1,845</p>
<h3>Native Cotton Factories Turn Stronger</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions have made considerable progress. Chinese factories such as Shenxin, Wing On, and De Feng have been actively purchasing, leading to prosperity. Therefore, the market price is unusually firm and has an upward trend. In reality, various sources are difficult to secure. According to letters from the four rural districts, the price of seed cotton in the countryside has also increased. Recently, the price of 10-count coarse yarn has been high, and factories have been replenishing their raw materials in greater quantities. Therefore, the demand for Indian cotton has also increased. The sources from Northern Jiangsu include 1,065 bales of Tongzhou cotton and 825 bales of grass-packed cotton, arriving over two days. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>In other news, the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been more sluggish in recent days. However, prices have remained very firm. The factory's intention to purchase has been rather weak lately, but fellow traders have not relaxed on sales prices. Fellow traders generally believe that the market's inventory is drying up day by day, so those with more financial leeway not only do not want to sell but also seize the opportunity to buy and store. Therefore, most believe that trading may become more prosperous in early October.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was relatively quiet in the early morning yesterday, primarily because fellow traders had little trading. Spot trading also saw a slight increase and triggered some short covering. The market situation was quite firm. The closing price rose by 7 or 8 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 2 rupees. The Egyptian cotton market rose by more than 30 points. Liverpool fell by 9 to 10 points.</p>
<h3>Grain: New Early Rice Appears; Siam Rice Increases by 1 or 2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Siam rice: New goods from various places have gradually entered the market recently. For example, new Kunsan glutinous rice has been on the market for almost a week. However, since the amount arriving is small, the glutinous rice market has not only been unaffected but has become expensive due to shortages. Amidst the rising prices of broken glutinous rice yesterday, new early rice also appeared on the market, with 60 bags of Fengjing Hundred Brother rice arriving. Moreover, since the weather has been favorable this year, the quality of the rice is very good, so it is very popular with stores, with the price opening at 4 yuan per bag. As for other glutinous rice, it is said that there are more than 30 ships of Hexia goods en route, but they were later diverted to Pudong and Hongkou districts. Therefore, the amount arriving in this port was only 3,000-odd bags of new goods from various districts such as Suzhou, Kunsan, Fengjing, and Jiaxing, transported by truck. Customer brokers were also shouting high prices, and importers were competing to buy to meet urgent needs, creating a tight situation. The market rose, and the result was an increase of 1 or 2 yuan compared to the pre-holiday closing. The prices in various top markets rose accordingly, and the prices in this street and rural villages increased by 2 or 3 cents after a one-day market closure for the Mid-Autumn Festival. At noon, with more goods arriving, Japanese merchants seized the opportunity to launch a large number of Wuhu top-quality rice, causing the market to be filled with chips and forming an oversupply, causing the market to fall back. The closing price of both old and new top-quality rice fell by about half a yuan compared to before the holiday. The trading price of special common broken glutinous rice was 42 yuan, medium was 38 yuan, special tin broken glutinous rice was 41 yuan, high was 40 yuan, medium was 38 yuan, Suzhou, Tong, Kunsan broken glutinous rice was 38 yuan, new glutinous rice was 37 yuan, Hexia old early and late rice was 38 yuan to 30 yuan, original bags were 40 yuan to 38 yuan, Fengjing Hundred Brother was 40 yuan, Suzhou, Kunsan, Fengjia new mutton tip special was 26.5 yuan, general market was 26 yuan, and decisive was 25 yuan, reed tip was 26 yuan to 25 yuan, Jiangbei new tip was 24 yuan, and decisive was 23 yuan, Wuhu special tip was 24.5 yuan, market was 24 yuan to 23.5 yuan, and decisive was 22 yuan, old tip was 23 yuan to 22.8 yuan, and the variable price was also better by half a yuan. This glutinous rice was 34-35 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous rice was 34 yuan to 33.5 yuan. The number of transactions totaled more than 8,000 bags.</p>
<p>Customer Indica: The morning market was affected by the soaring glutinous rice market, and the market once became popular. However, with the continuous arrival of goods, and Japanese merchants continuing to launch batches of 3,000 to 4,000 bags, the market immediately went downstream. The result was a slight decrease of 4 or 5 cents compared to before the holiday. High customer Indica opened at around 24 yuan, and medium decisive was 23-22 yuan. The number of transactions in the general market was 5,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Battleship Flour Market is Lively and Prosperous; Cannon Brand Increases by One Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour trading was still active. Because it was the opening of the market after the Mid-Autumn Festival, sales to customers were slightly more lively than before. Battleship flour was the most popular. In addition to the North China merchants adding to their purchases, the needs of this street and the inland were also not quiet. Moreover, exports of other miscellaneous brands of flour to Hong Kong and Xiamen have been quite a bit recently. The market was originally tight, but currently, each factory has ample flour in stock, and many hoarders are seeking to sell. Therefore, the factory price is 7 yuan for the original price, and the returned goods are still 7 yuan and 5 cents to 7 yuan, 1 dime and 4-5 cents. It is said that Battleship, Pi Jiao, and Cannon brands have increased by about 1 dime. Today, there were 54,100 bags of exported flour transported to Tianjin, and 4,000 bags transported to Hong Kong. The sources of wheat yesterday and today are still continuous. The goods arriving are still mostly wheat from Jing, Wu, Chang, and Xi. Each factory is not greedy for the need for raw materials because the flour in stock is sufficient. The cargo side is not willing to concede too much because the production price is not loose. As a result, there was not much honor or disgrace. The factory took more than 10,000 bags in the general market, and hoarders pulled in 7 or 8 carts. The highest price of wheat in the management store was 10 yuan, 2 dimes, and 3 cents, slightly tighter than before. The price of each wheat sold to the factory was similar to the previous opening.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Price Recovers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight recovery, increasing by 1 yuan to several dimes. The association's drawing price was 24. Raw white spot goods were 56 yuan at the main warehouse and 55.5 yuan to 56 yuan at the outer warehouse, and re-exports were 42 yuan.

This No. 1 crystal sugar was slightly loose, dropping by half a yuan to 67 yuan, and Jing Ming crystal sugar was 68.5 yuan. National sugar had little movement due to the small number of sales and still lacked transactions.</p>
<p>It was found that sugar goods arriving in Shanghai, previously (on the 26th), came from Hong Kong in 346 bags, on the 28th came from Beihai in 320 bags, and also came from Hong Kong in 800 bags.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Sales Turn Active; Selling Price Rises Again by More than a Yuan; Many Soybeans Exported</h3>
<p>Yesterday, because the Mid-Autumn Festival had passed, soybean oil sales in this street turned active. The inland also made inquiries, causing the market atmosphere to continue to be tense amidst optimistic views. The market price rose again by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan compared to before the holiday. A total of 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were opened for trading throughout the day, priced at 44 yuan. Qingqi oil was 200 pieces, priced at 44.5 yuan to 45 yuan.

Peanut oil arrivals and sales were balanced, and the market price rose slightly by 5 cents. 500 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, priced at 57.5 yuan, and divided among Hong Kong merchants and this street.</p>
<p>It was found that today there were 1,600 bags of soybeans transported to Tianjin, another 1,960 bags transported to Singapore, and another 50 bags transported to Penang.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: This Street Actively Handles National Cloth; Qingdao Fine Cloth Has No More Arrivals; Cloth Country</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was firm and high, which was due to the increased price of East Piece Goods market. For dyeing purposes, this street switched to handling national cloth, so this street's purchases were the strongest. More than 1,000 packages of fine cloth and fine twill were traded, and the selling price increased by 2 dimes and a half to 5 dimes per piece. The morning market for coarse cloth was flat, and the later market increased by 2 dimes per piece. However, coarse twill was the least lively due to sluggish actual sales. Customer routes, such as Sichuan and Yunnan merchants, stopped handling goods because of the obstructed Yunnan-Vietnam traffic. The sales of colored cloth and broadcloth were quite affected, and the market has turned stable, not as popular as white goods. Hoarders in this street were very enthusiastic about hoarding light-colored goods, such as pongee, striped bleached cloth, bleached cloth, fine yarn thread, and greige cloth, because fine yarn money was expensive.</p>
<p>East Piece Goods</p>
<p>White goods: Yesterday, because the dyeing industry in this street and the Tianjin merchants continued to have good demand, the market situation was active. The forwarders opened with 22 yuan and 5 dimes for next month's brand-name fine twill, 22 yuan for Baby brand, more than 200 packages, and 24 yuan for brand-name fine cloth, more than 100 packages. The market transaction was quite strong, reaching 800-odd pieces. The spot market price increased by a dime to 5 dimes per piece. Qingdao fine cloth has no more arrivals because the price at the place of origin is expensive, and the amount in stock in the Shanghai market is gradually running out.</p>
<p>There were 348 pieces of exported piece goods transported to Hong Kong, 3 pieces transported to Penang, and 30 pieces transported to Singapore on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Flat Iron is Expensive</h3>
<p>The flat iron market situation has been silent for a long time. Sales to customer merchants are sluggish, and purchases in this street are also sporadic. However, there is not much stock, and the places of origin for these goods are the UK, Belgium, and Germany. Because they are busy with the war, they have no time to transport goods, so overseas sources have been cut off. The asking price in this port is increasing day by day. Currently, the market price for 2-inch flat iron is 40 yuan per picul, 3-inch is 38 yuan, and the asking price for 4-inch is around 37 yuan. It has been found that it has increased by more than 10 yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Southern Gorgon Fruit Will Soon See New Goods; Old Pond Gorgon Fruit is Firm</h3>
<p>Southern pond gorgon fruit: The harvest this year is still poor. It has been heard that new goods have been seen in the production area, and the handling price is as high as 150 yuan. The large ones will soon arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Old pond gorgon fruit is firm, currently selling for 80 yuan. It has been heard that the new red gorgon fruit is also poor. When the time comes, the market price will inevitably rise accordingly.</p>

<h3>Central Bank: Fractional Currency Notes Issued Today; Entrusting Tobacco and Exchange Industry to Distribute; No Separate Counter Set Up; Can Be Circulated in the Market from Noon Today</h3>
<p>All Temporary Substitute Vouchers Should Be Recalled by the Deadline</p>
<p>The Central Bank, upon the order of the Ministry of Finance, issued one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, which were contracted to be printed by American Yongning Company. The first batch of 500,000 yuan has been completed. It was originally intended to be issued on August 22, but it was delayed due to the discovery of unstamped, unnumbered samples on the market. The bank, in order to be cautious, temporarily delayed the issue and negotiated with the printer to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the leakage outside. Now it has been clarified that the number of leaked samples outside is not large. In order to relieve the market's need and facilitate the change of each industry, it was decided to publicly announce the issue by the Shanghai branch from today and entrust the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association to distribute and exchange to each of its members. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Central Bank Publicly Announces Issuance</p>
<p>The Central Bank Shanghai Branch announced, "This bank is now issuing one type of five-cent note, both sides are blue, and one type of one-cent note, both sides are red. Both types have a watermark printed on the front and numbers and stamps printed on the back. It will be put into use immediately, and this bank has entrusted the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association to distribute and exchange to each of its members. This bank will not set up a counter for exchange. This is hereby announced. September 29, 28th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Entrusting Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association for Exchange</p>
<p>The first batch of fractional currency notes, totaling 300,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan in five-cent notes, will be issued by the Central Bank Shanghai Branch. The bank's Issuance Bureau has negotiated with the Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association, and it has been entrusted to the association to distribute and exchange to each tobacco and exchange store. The bank has decided not to set up a separate exchange counter. It is hoped that each industry will not go to the bank for exchange. As for the exchange of each bank and money shop, they can obtain the exchange from the bank through the Mountain Bank and the Money Industry Preparatory Association's treasury.</p>
<p>Inviting Fellow Traders to Prepare Funds for Exchange</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association sent market committee members Zhang Shibin and Shen Shihe with a letter to the Central Bank to discuss collecting fractional currency notes. The letter is recorded as follows, "Respectfully informing that last month we received a letter in which our fellow traders pre-ordered fractional currency notes. This afternoon, we received a phone notification from your bank that the fractional currency notes are about to be issued and that our fellow traders should prepare funds for exchange. We have already summoned our fellow traders to pay and exchange with your bank. We have now gathered the funds and hereby send a letter and personnel to negotiate in person. It is hoped that the fractional currency notes will be handed over to the original person for transfer." Yesterday, 94 members prepared funds totaling 34,700 yuan to exchange for fractional currency notes from the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Full Reserve and Exchange Method</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice Society learned from the Central Bank that the reserve for the fractional currency notes is a 100% reserve in legal tender. Anyone holding 20 five-cent fractional currency notes or 100 one-cent fractional currency notes can exchange them for one yuan of legal tender from the bank's Issuance Bureau. The first batch of 500,000 yuan will be issued and circulated in the Shanghai market. In the future, it will continue to be printed according to market needs. The Central Bank Shanghai Branch has reported the scheduled issue and the entrustment to the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association to the Chongqing headquarters and sent the fractional currency note design to the headquarters for submission to the Ministry of Finance for record.</p>
<p>Issued This Morning and Circulated in Shanghai</p>
<p>The 500,000 yuan of fractional currency notes was printed by American Yongning Company and was delivered in full to the Central Bank Shanghai Branch last night in accordance with the printing contract. The bank's Issuance Bureau sent personnel to count and prepare to issue them at 9:00 AM today and negotiated with Zhang Shibin and others from the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association's market committee, and it was decided that they will go to collect them at 10:00 AM this morning. From 11:00 AM today, the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association will distribute them to each member, and they can be circulated in the market from noon.</p>
<p>Temporary Substitute Vouchers of Each Industry Should Be Recalled</p>
<p>In order to cope with the lack of small change and solve the difficulty of giving change, each industry in this city, in addition to using postage stamps and revenue stamps, has mostly issued its own substitute vouchers for circulation. Due to the forgery and misuse by unscrupulous people, the credibility of substitute vouchers has been lost, and disputes arise from time to time when they are used. Now that the Central Bank's Shanghai Branch has been ordered to formally issue fractional currency notes, substitute vouchers, which were originally a temporary expedient, should be publicly announced to be recalled by the deadline in order to strengthen the national monetary system. As for the temporary fractional currency notes issued by the tram companies and public bus companies in the two concessions, they should all be recalled in accordance with the deadline.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops Near Nicheng Heavily Threatened; Gu's Troops Intercept and Ambush; Large Group of Japanese Troops Withdraw</h3>
<p>The troops under Gu Lifeng, the captain of the Special Task Force of the Fourth Detachment of the Patriotic National Salvation Army in Pudong, are mostly members of the merchant corps and young people who have received considerable training. Since the Japanese and puppet troops occupied Datuan, Gu's troops have been scattered in the countryside, using mobile strategies to continue fighting consistently. For example, in the Nicheng area near the sea,</p>
<p>More than a Thousand Japanese and Puppet Troops</p>
<p>Tried to carry out search operations, but were repeatedly intercepted and ambushed by Gu's troops in the late night. When the Japanese and puppet troops pursued, Gu's troops had dispersed, and the surrounding area was mostly vast fields of reeds, with no trace left. The Japanese and puppet troops indiscriminately fired into the reeds, and even after carefully searching the reeds during the day, they found nothing. After three consecutive days, the Japanese and puppet troops could not bear the threat,</p>
<p>And Returned to Datuan</p>
<p>Suddenly, on the night of the 25th, the Japanese and puppet troops split into five teams and advanced towards Nicheng and Pengzhen on the left side of the area, and Xinzhen on the right side. Unexpectedly, their movements were detected by Gu's troops, who urgently sent troops to ambush in the essential roads near Chenjiadian (still eight li away from Xinzhen). When a part of the Japanese and puppet troops, more than 200 people, passed by, they immediately surrounded and ambushed them on all sides. The sound of machine guns and rifles was as dense as connected beads. It was at night, and the Japanese and puppet troops did not know how many guerrillas there were, so they quickly</p>
<p>Sent a Signal for Help</p>
<p>By the time the Japanese and puppet troops from the left route arrived, it was already dawn, and Gu's troops had also withdrawn. Although the army searched nearby in the villages within one or two li, they found nothing. It was heard that more than ten Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed or wounded in this battle. Guo Zongqiang, the platoon leader of Gu's troops, was wounded and has now been sent to a safe area for treatment. Four other soldiers were wounded. According to people who came that day, the Japanese and puppet troops were still searching and had not returned to Datuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops Control Vegetables; Local Goods Industry Expresses Opposition; If Implemented, the Impact Will Be Great; Will Hold Meeting to Discuss Effective Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Regarding the "Municipal Government's" plan to establish a "Shanghai Vegetable Market" at the former site of the Four Banks Warehouse on North Suzhou Road to complete the Japanese side's attempt to control the main food supplies of the two concessions, a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency yesterday inquired about this news from a leader of the local goods industry. According to him, this rumor had been heard a long time ago. However, the registration method and</p>
<p>Detailed Regulations</p>
<p>The local goods industry has not received any oral or written notice from any party. However, it is believed that there must be treacherous people who, out of greed for personal gain, are helping the tyrant to do evil, hoping for its implementation. The local goods industry sent people to inspect the Four Banks Warehouse near the New Garbage Bridge yesterday morning. Besides the Japanese military police and puppet police still stationed at the entrance of the warehouse, there was no sign of</p>
<p>Anything Unusual</p>
<p>People were also sent to inquire about the local goods industry in Hongkou, who also said that they were unaware of this matter. However, if this control is implemented, it will have a great impact on the local goods industry in the concessions. If it is implemented, it will be necessary to hold a meeting to discuss effective countermeasures. The person also said that the current market vegetables are</p>
<p>Not Smoothly Sourced</p>
<p>And the prices are gradually increasing, which has already made it impossible for ordinary people to buy. If they are controlled, it will be even more difficult to bear. It can be asserted. In recent days, when vegetables transported from Pudong to the Laozha Bridge passed through the Second Baidu Bridge, there were often interceptions of vegetable boats, ordering them to be sold to the Hongkou Vegetable Market.</p>
<h3>Local Products Transshipped from Ningbo to Shanghai Must First Settle Foreign Exchange; Each Industry Submits Request for Relief to the Ministry; Ningbo Goods Transported to Shanghai Will Be Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Zhejiang Customs received an order from the Ministry of Finance that all local products transshipped from Ningbo to Shanghai, regardless of the type of goods, must first settle foreign exchange, otherwise customs clearance will be refused. Therefore, many goods waiting to be transported from Ningbo to Shanghai are stockpiled and cannot be loaded. Although each industry in Ningbo is currently requesting relief from the Ministry of Finance, until there is an indication of a change in the method, the transport of goods from Ningbo to Shanghai will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Shortening the Voyage Also Obstructed</p>
<p>Although the authorities of each passenger and cargo ship intend to reduce cargo transportation as much as possible and carry more passengers, Mou Fushu of the Shipping Department of the Libe and Foreign Firm temporarily returned to Shanghai while the Ningbo goods were not yet unloaded, so that he could carry passengers and restart to Zhenhai. In this way, passengers urgently waiting to return to Ningbo could board earlier, and the shipping company could save the unnecessary time spent lingering outside the Zhenhai Estuary. However, it did not materialize due to some reason and decided to return to Shanghai after unloading the goods in Zhenhai. The original plan to open Zhenhai on October 1 has been canceled.</p>
<p>The First Shipping Vessel to Depart from Shanghai to Ningbo</p>
<p>The De Ping, a ship of Zhongyi Company, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The ship was originally scheduled to depart from Zhenhai at 4:00 PM on the 29th. However, due to Mou Fushu's postponement of the return to Shanghai, the goods waiting to be loaded on the ship increased, and loading took time. Therefore, the ship has been postponed to set sail for Zhenhai at 4:00 PM on the 30th. After that, the first ship to return to Shanghai from Zhenhai will be Haifu.</p>
<h3>Second Price-Stabilized Rice Sale Decided to Be Postponed; Meeting to Be Held Regularly with Various Groups to Conclude First Price-Stabilized Rice Sale</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Industry Association has decided to organize the sale of 8,000 bags of tribute rice for each group, and the two concessions have a total of five locations, which were all completed on the 25th of this month. The full handover has been completed. The rice industry association held the 16th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the meeting place on Shanhai Guan Road at 3:00 PM yesterday, and Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Qu Zhenhua, Pan Jibin, Shi Hongxun, Huang Ruyuan, Xia Tongfu, Chen Shaolian, Wan Peiyuan, Chen Liangqi, Jiang Qiusheng and other more than 20 people attended. Chairman Zhang Nianxuan, first the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and the status of the association affairs, and then the directors of each price-stabilized rice sale location separately reported on the price-stabilized rice sale process, and then the chairman reported on the price-stabilized rice sale handover, and proposed to send letters to the relevant groups and schedule joint meetings to conclude the price-stabilized rice sale matters, all of which were unanimously approved. Also, regarding the second price-stabilized rice sale, yesterday the chairman of the Rice Industry Association committee, Zhang Nianxuan, told a reporter from the New Voice Society that after repeated consultations, it was decided to postpone the event temporarily, because the national rice from various places has already entered the market and will be transported here continuously. At that time, the Shanghai rice price will fall, so the price stabilization is no longer needed.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Still Stationed Inside City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Since the British defense forces expelled the puppet police stationed inside the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce in Tianhou Palace on North Henan Road, the site was guarded by puppet detectives yesterday morning. By the afternoon, it was guarded by armed puppet police again. When a reporter from Da Guang News Agency went to inspect, they saw a puppet policeman inside the guard pavilion on the side door of the Tianhou Palace, and a puppet policeman idling in front of the guard room at the north end of the City Chamber of Commerce. A plainclothes puppet detective was standing outside the gate of the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>New Property Tax Rate for the Public Concession</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that the property tax for the winter of this year should be paid on October 1. In accordance with the resolution of the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the previous session, from October 1 of this year, the property tax rate within the concession will be changed to 18%, and the property tax rate in the road area outside the concession will be changed to 16%. Also, the property tax for Western-style houses will not be collected by separate personnel. After receiving the tax bill, each household should go directly to the tax division at No. 209 Jiangxi Road to pay.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Xinghua</h3>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reported that according to a private source in the financial community who received a telegram from Xinghua, Northern Jiangsu, Japanese planes flew to Xinghua City again on the morning of the 26th and bombed the seat of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government had already moved to another place, so most of those bombed were innocent civilians, and the losses are being investigated.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Industries Again Request Authorities to Find Ways to Suppress Rice Prices; Restore Rice Stock Survey Work in Shanghai; Negotiate with Japanese to Dredge Rice Sources</h3>
<p>Hua Wen News Agency reported that due to the supply of foreign rice and the arrival of new domestic rice, the serious problem of food for the people in this city seems to be gradually resolved. However, the rice price has not yet recovered to the standard level, so all parties are still suppressing the food problem. According to news from the bean and rice industry association, the foreign indica rice is still between 25 and 26 yuan per dan recently, and the Changxi high japonica rice is still as high as 40 yuan per dan. Now that the new rice is on the market and foreign rice is increasing, if no measures are taken to suppress the rice price, the rice price will be unimaginably high when the end of the year arrives. Now the Yusheng factories and Yongfeng printing industry and various industry groups in this city have jointly written to the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association and the bean and rice industry association, requesting that the weekly survey and public announcement method of rice stocks in this city be restored as before, and at the same time, requesting the concession authorities to actively negotiate with the Japanese to dredge the sources of rice, and strive to suppress the rice price to below the standard in the near future to maintain livelihoods and reassure the people.</p>

According to U.S. naval sources, the Yangtze River Fleet will make Wuhu its final destination in the future so that it can quickly sail to Shanghai to strengthen its defenses if the situation in Shanghai changes. It is also learned that the U.S. giant ship Agassiz will sail to Shanghai from Manila to increase its defense strength. The U.S. naval authorities in this port received a telegram from the ship on the 26th that it could arrive here as early as today. According to reporters, the U.S. naval authorities will continue to send fleets to Shanghai to increase its defense in the next few months.</p>

<h3>Puppet Police Invade Western Shanghai with the Aim of Forcibly Collecting Taxes; Residents Uphold Justice and Firmly Refuse; Municipal Council Is Considering Solutions</h3>
<p>The infringement of rights by the puppet "Municipal Government" in the extra-settlement road areas of Western Shanghai has recently intensified. It is reported that residents in these areas have been notified that they must pay taxes to the puppet "Municipal Government" starting next quarter. A reporter inquired about this matter yesterday with an official of the Shanghai Municipal Council, who stated that the puppet "Municipal Government's" demand for collecting property taxes in the extra-settlement areas was a new development as far as he was aware. He mentioned that before the August 13th incident, the Finance Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government had made this request, but the Municipal Council had not agreed. The Municipal Council is still paying close attention to the situation in the extra-settlement areas. Although the current situation may not fully satisfy the residents, all the council members are doing their best to find a way to stabilize the situation.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Collect Taxes, Residents Refuse</p>
<p>Since the Japanese and puppet sides are actively seeking to establish economic control in the extra-settlement road area of Western Shanghai, the "Dadao Municipal Government Finance Bureau" has been exerting pressure to collect property taxes in the streets and lanes of the area. Yesterday morning, around 11:00 AM, the "Dadao Finance Bureau" sent a puppet "police" officer named Wang Bin, riding a bicycle, to the Dehe Lane area on Avenue Petain to collect property taxes. When he arrived at No. 15, he was met with opposition from over twenty residents. At the same time, the "police" officer's bicycle suddenly disappeared, leading the residents to be suspected of causing trouble. The puppet "police" officer reported this to the puppet "police" substation on Avenue Petain, which dispatched officers to investigate. As a result, a man named Lü Daoxuan was taken away by the "police" and had not been released by nightfall.</p>
<p>Puppet Side Notifies Tax Collection</p>
<p>The English-language China Press reported, "The 'Dadao' authorities are exerting pressure in the Western Shanghai badlands, and are now going further by demanding taxes for the next quarter from residents in the lanes off the Settlement roads." The English-language China Press received a letter today (the 28th) from a regular resident in the area, describing the difficult situation faced by the residents and expressing concern that they may now have to pay two sets of taxes.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Considers Solutions</p>
<p>Inquiries made with the Municipal Council this morning revealed that the Council was also hearing about the "Municipal Government's" tax demands for the first time. Before the war, the former Municipal Government Tax Bureau, responsible for areas outside the Settlement, had made similar requests. According to a Municipal Council spokesperson this morning, the Council is constantly paying attention to the issue of roads outside the Settlement. The current situation in the area may not fully satisfy the residents, but the Municipal Council members are doing their best to find a solution.</p>
<p>Residents in the Western District Face Hardship</p>
<p>The letter received by the English-language China Press stated that the thousands of residents in the western district abandoned by the Municipal Council are facing extreme difficulties. The "New Municipal Government Tax Bureau" recently notified residents in the area that taxes for the next quarter must be paid to the bureau. If residents refuse to pay taxes to the Dadao authorities, their houses will be cut off and sealed, while Settlement authorities stand by and watch. If they refuse to pay taxes to the Municipal Council, their water and electricity will be cut off. If they pay taxes to both sides, residents will inevitably have to tighten their belts and reduce expenses. Currently, the Dadao authorities do not allow residents in the area to move, so the only solution seems to be for residents to escape alone in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>People are Moving to Avoid the Trouble</p>
<p>Since the incident of the puppet police detaining American sailors on Yu Yuan Road, the police have been sending additional detectives to patrol the road daily, making the situation more tense than elsewhere. After Japanese military police went to Zhaofeng Village (near Zhaofeng Park) to investigate household registrations and notify residents that rent would be collected starting October 1st, most of the third-party tenants have been moving out, creating a scene of empty buildings, except for some second-landlords who are unwilling to give up the large transfer fees they have paid and are temporarily adopting a wait-and-see approach. All day yesterday, busy scenes of people moving boxes and furniture could be seen everywhere on Yu Yuan Road. Starting yesterday, armed Japanese military police in groups of two have been patrolling the area, and the number of puppet police stationed in front of the Toyota textile factory employee dormitory at No. 1249 has also increased from four to six.</p>
<p>Puppet Government's Economy in Dire Straits</p>
<p>The so-called "Municipal Government" is currently experiencing hidden worries and panic regarding its finances. This situation arose because the "Reformed Government Ministry of Finance" suddenly stopped its monthly subsidy of 450,000 yuan at the end of August. The "Municipal Government's" budget requires monthly expenditures of 800,000 yuan, and now more than half of the funding has suddenly disappeared. The August salaries, which were supposed to be paid at the end of August, were barely scraped together by the "Municipal Government" itself. The September salaries, which will be paid at the end of September, have only half of the amount secured, while the other half, originally listed under the "Reformed Government" subsidy, has vanished. In desperation, Chuan Xiaoan will propose paying only half salaries temporarily at the end of this month. The "Municipal Government" originally could collect 600,000 yuan in exorbitant "taxes" each month, but since the "consumption tax" was forcibly canceled by the "Reformed Government" in February of this year, monthly revenue has decreased to 200,000 yuan. Even with the "Reformed Government" subsidy, the total was only over 600,000 yuan. Subsequently, the "property tax," "vehicle tax," "boat tax," and "business tax" were reinstated, increasing monthly revenue to 800,000 yuan, sometimes nearly one million yuan. Now, the "Reformed Government" has suddenly canceled the subsidy, citing an empty treasury, delivering a fatal blow to the "Municipal Government's" economic lifeline. Therefore, the "Mayor and Bureau Chiefs" are planning to levy new "taxes" to try to make up the shortfall.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Stationed Near the Settlement</p>
<p>The locations where puppet police are stationed are gradually extending towards the Settlement. Avenue du President Foch still ends at Avenue Paulins, but Avenue Amherest now reaches Avenue Haig. Starting yesterday, four puppet police officers were stationed at the intersection of Avenue du Haig and Rue Massenet, and a squad of puppet police officers patrolled back and forth with Mauser rifles. The puppet police stationed near the Fa Hua Bridge have recently been stopping and questioning pedestrians, causing unease among nearby residents.</p>
<p>Construction Projects Completed Everywhere</p>
<p>The defensive works constructed by the Japanese and puppet forces at (1) the front gate of No. 11 Avenue Haig, (2) in front of the Japanese military police Western District Command and puppet police substation at the intersection of Route Kaufmann, (3) the front gate of No. 1760 Jing An Si Road, and (4) in front of the Lin family mansion at No. 448 Avenue Haig have all been completed after several revisions. Watchtowers have been added at each entrance and exit, and wooden sunshades have been built on top of the fortifications for nighttime watch and rain shelter.</p>
<p>Security in Western Shanghai Becomes More Chaotic</p>
<p>In the Caojiadu area of the extra-settlement road in Western Shanghai, gambling dens and opium dens are being established under the guise of "clubs," "companies," "conversation rooms," and "ticket houses," with the support of the Japanese and puppet forces, almost every five steps a den, every ten steps a room, becoming a breeding ground for sin and confusion. Since the puppet police encroached on the area, order has become even more chaotic. Lately, plainclothes "criminals" carrying sharp weapons, falsely claiming to be "searching for targets," have been specializing in roadside robberies, happening several times a day. The Japanese military and puppet police have never interfered with this "new order."</p>
<p>Still Quiet in Zhaofeng Village</p>
<p>The "Dadao Police" in the extra-settlement road area of Western Shanghai are still frequently marching in formation on various roads. A reporter made a special trip yesterday to inspect the extra-settlement road area of Western Shanghai and found "Dadao Police" stationed at the intersections of Avenue Amherest and Rue Massenet, Yu Yuan Road and Avenue du President Foch, and Avenue Haig and Avenue Petain, sharing space with Settlement police. Residents in Zhaofeng Village are still living as usual. The majority of the residents in the dozens of houses are businessmen.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Member Funatsu Resigns</h3>
<p>Funatsu, the Japanese member of the Finance Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has resigned due to his departure from Shanghai to return to Japan. His resignation has been approved, and the Council expressed its gratitude for his contributions.</p>
<h3>Meat Industry Dispute in the French Concession: Butchers Breach Contract; Municipal Council Mediates Again; Handled According to Previous Agreement</h3>
<p>After the French Municipal Council's Political Affairs Department convened both parties to resolve the dispute between the fresh meat industry and the butchering industry in the French Concession, the butchers suddenly announced on the evening of the 26th that pigs would only be butchered after butchering fees were paid for and tickets were purchased, setting the price at 90 cents per ticket. The meat industry considered this a clear breach of contract and requested the French Municipal Council to mediate again on the 27th. Since representatives from both sides could not be present that day, the meeting was rescheduled for 10:00 AM yesterday, gathering representatives from both sides at the Political Affairs Department of the French Municipal Council. The Political Affairs Department considered this a clear breach of contract by the butchering industry and ordered the cancellation of the advance payment and ticket purchase method, and that the price should not be arbitrarily set at 90 cents, but should be handled according to the previously agreed method, with an increase of 40 cents per pig. Regarding the bookkeeping and cash payment of the butchering fees, they instructed individual arrangements with each meat shop. Furthermore, since the French Concession Butchering Industry Association had not registered with the French Municipal Council, they should complete the registration procedures as soon as possible before being allowed to exist. In addition, the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou used to divide piglets into four grades and mark the grade on the piglet's abdomen or back. Yesterday, the French Concession meat industry received a notice from the market that because the hair on the piglet's abdomen and back was easily blurred after shearing, a new method would be implemented starting today (the 29th): first-grade pigs would not be marked, second-grade pigs would have one hole punched in their right ear, third-grade pigs would have two holes, and fourth-grade pigs would have three holes.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Aojiang, Foreign Ships Affected; Glen Line's "Glenshiel" and China Navigation Company's "New Peking" Damaged; Japanese Planes Strafe Barges with Machine Guns, Infringing on Coastal Navigation Rights of Various Nations</h3>
<p>Further investigations into the bombing of Aojiang in eastern Zhejiang have revealed that three Japanese naval aircraft suddenly appeared over Aojiang around 2:00 PM on the 25th and dropped five bombs on the docks, causing fires in riverside houses that burned fiercely. Two bombs landed near the docks, causing shrapnel damage to Glen Line's British ship "Glenshiel" and China Navigation Company's "New Peking." The afterdeck of the "Glenshiel" was destroyed, and the cabin windows and berths of the "New Peking" were shattered. Japanese planes also strafed barges with machine guns, killing two boatmen.</p>
<p>Two British Ships Depart to Shanghai to Avoid Situation</p>
<p>The "Glenshiel" and "New Peking" intended to leave the docks immediately when the Japanese planes bombed, but they were stopped by military police. They only managed to escape to the exit on the 25th. At the time, two military police officers were still on board the "New Peking." After passing the blockade line, they hired a small boat to send them back and proceeded directly to Shanghai. They arrived in Shanghai around 6:00 PM the night before last (the 27th). The "Glenshiel" is docked at the Yangshupu pontoon, and the "New Peking" is docked at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession. Workers have already been hired to repair all the damaged parts. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s British ship "Xin Xiang Tai" arrived at Aojiang on the 25th to load cargo and was stopped from entering the port by Japanese warships. It is currently anchored outside the port, and the company is planning to observe the situation before deciding on further action. Yih Lung Company's "Shen You" is anchored at a certain place at the exit.</p>
<p>Bombing Aimed at Preventing Navigation</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that Aojiang is about 100 li away from Wenzhou and used to have Chinese ships sailing there. After the war, the area was blockaded by the authorities, allowing only navigation to the port of Wenzhou. Subsequently, due to harassment by Japanese warships, it was also blockaded. Recently, after requests from various foreign shipping companies, permission was granted to reopen the route. As a result, British ships such as the "Xin An Li" resumed sailing to facilitate cargo transportation, but the Japanese side immediately obstructed this, announcing that the area would be re-blockaded from the evening of the 17th of this month and navigation would be prohibited. The ships then changed course to Aojiang, and the goods were transferred to Wenzhou from there. The Japanese planes then bombed the area, with the aim of completely preventing foreign ships from sailing, infringing on the navigational rights of various countries. It is now clear that in order to avoid danger, various shipping companies have decided to change routes, and Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping has been completely cut off again.</p>
<h3>Squadron Leader Moller Safe and Sound; Reported to Have Been Captured by Germans</h3>
<p>Reuters, Seventh Sea, 28th: The British Air Force casualty list recently included the words "Squadron Leader Moller, former Air Attache at the British Embassy in Shanghai, is now missing and presumed dead." According to private news received from Shanghai, Squadron Leader Moller is not dead, but is reported to have been captured by the Germans.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchants from Nanyang Inspect Domestic Industries</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Tong, a Nanyang Overseas Chinese and the eldest son of the prominent merchant Mr. Li Fengduo, is the General Manager of the Shanghai Taiyi Malt Extract Factory in Nanyang. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago specifically to inspect the current state of domestic industries. Mr. Li is particularly enthusiastic about promoting domestic products in Nanyang. Having completed his inspection, he originally planned to return to Nanyang on the 28th of this month, but due to requests from various sectors to stay, he has postponed his departure for a few days. It is also reported that the Factory Director of Taiyi Malt Extract Factory, Mr. Zhang Hongjiu, and the Manager, Mr. Wang Zhengyu, will host a farewell banquet soon.</p>
<h3>Dr. Zhang Bu-xiong Seeks Welfare for the Common People</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhang Bu-xiong, who previously studied in England, America, and Germany, has medical doctorate degrees from Harvard and Liverpool Universities. He has extensive research in surgery and tropical diseases. In the United States, he served as a resident surgeon at the Minneapolis Municipal Hospital for several years. Due to his contributions to medicine, he was elected as a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Royal Society of England. After returning to China, he established the Bu-xiong Hospital in Suzhou and also served as the Director of Surgery at Bo Xi Hospital. When the war broke out, Dr. Zhang sought refuge inland and eventually came to Shanghai last year, setting up a clinic at Liji Pharmacy on Nanjing Road. Dr. Zhang is a Christian who practices medicine with the aim of saving the world. Deeply moved by the fact that the general public in the country is largely unable to enjoy the benefits of modern medical science due to economic constraints, he is consulting with international philanthropists to establish a large-scale people's hospital to supplement the shortcomings of existing public hospitals. It is reported that this plan is largely finalized.</p>
<h3>Knowledge for Couples</h3>

<p>The Origins and Treatment of Hidden Diseases Between Couples</p>
<p>After marriage, there are several strange ailments that may befall a couple. On the surface, there may appear to be nothing wrong, but the internal physical and mental harm can be more severe than any other illness. The pain is like a mute eating Coptis chinensis, unable to express their suffering, and simply shedding tears internally!</p>
<p>It is a common occurrence that the passion between couples gradually fades. An emotionally fervent husband may even suspect his beloved wife of infidelity. At the same time, a deeply affectionate wife may be alarmed to see her husband's health gradually decline, having nightmares at night and being filled with sorrow during the day. Why does a man's health decline after marriage? According to medical analysis, it is mostly due to early self-abuse and nocturnal emissions, or post-marital debauchery, which depletes the reproductive gland fluids that are essential for health. This leads to neurasthenia, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, premature aging, and a host of other symptoms. Such a sick husband not only suffers from the inability to bear the burden of the family, but also cannot fulfill his obligations in the life of love, often leaving his beloved wife hanging. While he himself is unable to cope, his wife, who is full of love and affection, suffers a serious impact on her body and mind. Many young women suffer from menstrual disorders, lack of sensation, anemia, infertility, breast tumors, and hysterical symptoms, mostly due to unsatisfactory sexual life. In a magazine, a doctor published many similar cases, saying, "When the husband's premature ejaculation is cured, the wife's lack of sensation is also cured." The conclusion is: "Uterine congestion and mental disorders in women are particularly related to an unsatisfactory sex life."</p>
<p>Hidden illnesses, private suffering, for yourself and others, should be treated quickly! If you hide your illness and avoid medical treatment, you will harm yourself and others, falling into endless misery! Regarding treatment methods, world-renowned doctors and I, Zhan Nianceng, recommend reproductive gland extract "Spermogen" as the most effective treatment. This agent is extracted from the reproductive glands of robust animals such as orangutans, bears, deer, and seals, and is concentrated and replicated using scientific methods. Therefore, its quality is precious and its restorative power is unparalleled. After taking it, it can generate essence, replenish the kidneys, nourish nerves, strengthen the brain, and invigorate blood within a day and night, exerting five major functions. Regular use can promote development and regulate metabolism, not only eradicating various symptoms in a short period of time, but also achieving the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth. Women should take "Female Spermogen" to eliminate various hidden diseases, with even more significant effects!</p>
<p>Patient Chen Dongyuan suffered from severe brain weakness and kidney deficiency due to nocturnal emissions and debauchery. As a result, he was unemployed at home, and his marriage was disharmonious, with their relationship as cold as ice. He came to me for treatment last month. After a careful examination, I instructed him to purchase "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets" and "Spermogen" at the Yong An Company pharmacy and take them together. The nocturnal emissions stopped after a week. After a month, he felt his brain was clear and his energy was abundant. The love between husband and wife was restored, and he was newly hired by a large company. Love and career came together, what happiness!</p>
<h3>The Worries After Untreated Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>A minor illness that is cured quickly is unavoidable. However, one must never delay when they are sick. Many fatal serious illnesses start from delaying treatment of minor ailments. For example, spermatorrhea in a young man, if treated quickly, is insignificant and easy to treat. If left untreated, the seminal gate will inevitably loosen, progressing from light nocturnal emission to severe spermatorrhea. Due to the long-term sperm leakage, essence withers and blood dries up, leading to kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and neurasthenia. It is even common for it to develop into anemia, tuberculosis, and premature death!</p>
<p>Semen, in physiological terms, is the reproductive gland fluid, and it is indeed the source of our life. In addition to its role in reproduction, it helps promote development, nourish nerves, and regulate metabolism. Therefore, those with depleted semen cannot escape the aforementioned symptoms and will feel weak and incapable in the essential reproductive work of life, or even completely impotent and unable to procreate. Thus, even with a beautiful wife, they cannot enjoy her grace, and can only become a sinner in love and a useless person in society!</p>
<p>To save young men suffering from spermatorrhea, German Dr. Hemitol spent decades of painstaking experimentation and secretly formulated a special medicine for treating spermatorrhea, "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets." After clinical trials by famous Chinese and foreign doctors and myself, it was determined that this medicine effectively strengthens the seminal gate and calms the nerves, providing a miraculous effect of inducing sleep and stopping nocturnal emissions on the same night. However, for those who already have the above symptoms due to untreated spermatorrhea, they must also take the reproductive gland extract "Spermogen" to fundamentally nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves. Continued use can promote development and regulate metabolism, not only eradicating various symptoms in a short period of time, but also achieving the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth.</p>
<p>Patient Zhuang Yanqiang, from Jiangxi, 23 years old, was studying at a university. He brought his family to Shanghai, and had suffered from spermatorrhea for three years. Recently, he suffered from severe brain weakness and kidney deficiency. He often failed his exams, and feared them. Due to an unsatisfactory marriage, the relationship between husband and wife was as cold as ice. He felt the darkness and pain of life. He came to me for treatment during the summer vacation, and I immediately instructed him to purchase "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets" and "Spermogen" at the China and Western Pharmacy and take them together, and also applied electrotherapy and injections. Now, after one and a half months, all his ailments have suddenly disappeared. His energy is abundant and even surpasses that of ordinary people!</p>
<h3>Distorted and Withered Peaks Lack Health and Beauty</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>A woman with a slender body, high and firm breasts, full hips, coupled with rosy cheeks and vibrant blood, naturally exudes joy and generosity in daily life. In her words and actions, she possesses boundless charm and beauty, which is truly something to be proud of! If such a beautiful woman meets a talented man and they form a happy marriage, their harmonious love will surely lead to intelligent children and a joyful family. On leisurely days after work, she can accompany her beloved husband and lead her own little angel, going in and out of parks and the countryside. Seeing such a scene, wouldn't people exclaim, "I only envy the loving couple, not the immortals!" Therefore, a woman's health and beauty are indeed the source of her happiness!</p>
<p>If a woman completely loses her health and beauty, the tragedy of her fate is unimaginable! Think about it, which man would want to marry a sickly and ugly old woman? Even if he did, he would not cherish her and might even abandon her! How does a woman lose her health and beauty? According to medical judgment, the cause is often self-indulgence or suffering from menstrual disorders, leucorrhea, infertility, anemia, tuberculosis, and other diseases that damage the function of the ovaries. The ovaries are the central point for the development of a woman's unique beauty. If the ovarian function is weakened, the breasts will not develop well, or if they have already developed, they will gradually wither and shrink. The hips will also become thin, lacking curves. Blood will be deficient, and the face will appear pale or sallow, showing signs of premature aging. If such a woman is then abandoned by her husband, she would feel a sense of rootlessness and drifting in this desolate autumn scene! However, seeking a remedy is not difficult. According to world-renowned gynecologists and my own experience, taking ovarian preparations, the female "Reproductive Hormone," can certainly drive away the above symptoms to the farthest clouds. This medicine is a world-famous gynecological remedy. After taking it, it can regulate menstruation, stop leucorrhea, and promote development. It can cure various symptoms in a short period of time, and regular use can make the breasts stand up, the face become rosy, and youth be prolonged.</p>

<h3>Singapore Restricts Imports, Shanghai Manufacturers Pay Close Attention, Local Government Promulgates National Defense Financial Regulations, Chinese Goods Exporting Southward Are Obstructed and Currently Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>The government of the Straits Settlements (Singapore) in Malaya promulgated foreign exchange control regulations starting from September 13th, including Chinese legal tender. The local government promulgated national defense financial regulations, which must be followed by all people within the colony regarding foreign exchange transactions and the trade of foreign securities. Regarding foreign securities, it is limited to British citizens only. All foreign securities under the above control must be returned to the government and cannot be transferred without government permission. All gold should be sold to the government. Since the government promulgated the regulations, our overseas Chinese have paid great attention to them, because a quarter of the residents of Malaya are our overseas Chinese, most of whom need to remit money back home to support their families. Therefore, the government has also adopted lenient measures to reassure the people. The so-called remittances for household use are limited to 500 Straits dollars per person. Beyond this limit, a request must be made to the government. The details of the situation are described below.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Control: The Malayan government has designated Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC, the Indian Commercial Bank, and the Oriental Bank to have full authority to purchase gold and foreign exchange. Other banks (including Chinese banks) are affiliated with the banks designated by the government. The prices of imported goods and travel expenses must first be submitted to the local government for approval before they can be approved. All banks must submit their full daily sales details to the government. Importers must provide evidence for goods ordered before September 14th and request registration with the import registrar. After government registration, imports can proceed as usual. If imported after the promulgation of the regulations, an application must first be submitted to the authorities for approval before import and remittance to other countries are permitted. There are also separate regulations for release fees. After foreign exchange control, the market has changed slightly, but is generally stable and orderly.</p>
<p>Remittances by Overseas Chinese: Overseas Chinese have close ties with local finance. The authorities have specifically stipulated that each remittance is limited to 500 Straits dollars, which can be remitted to the country as usual without any problems. The exchange rate is 100 legal tender dollars equal to 15.75 Straits dollars, and the Hong Kong exchange rate is 100 Hong Kong dollars equal to 54 Straits dollars. Major banks such as the Bank of China and the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation conduct remittances as usual. There are more than one million overseas Chinese in Malaya, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Although parts of these two provinces have fallen, the banks operated by Chinese people are making every effort to dredge them, which is really a complete relationship with the country and the people's strength.</p>
<p>Import Ban: The local government also simultaneously promulgated a list of 34 types of goods from non-sterling countries that are prohibited from import (except those specifically permitted by the import registrar). The purpose is to protect the level of the gold standard and prevent gold from escaping. The list includes: (1) taxable beverages and tobacco, (2) animals not for food, (3) non-metallic minerals and non-coal minerals, (4) raw cotton, (5) other raw materials for piece goods, (6) pottery, glass, and non-cement and glass jars, etc., (7) non-iron products, etc., (8) electrical appliances, (9) machinery, (10) cotton money and products, (11) wool products, (12) silk and silk fabrics, (13) other raw materials for piece goods, ramie is not included, (14) clothing, (15) medicinal materials, (16) leather and products, (17) vehicles, (18) rubber products, (19) bracelets, (20) imitation pearls, (21) furniture, (22) antiques, (23) all cosmetic products, (24) artificial flowers, (25) gold thread, (26) imitation gold leaf and silver leaf, (27) jewelry and goldsmith supplies, (28) paint supplies, (29) lamps and lanterns, etc., (30) various musical instruments, (31) perfumes and powders, etc., (32) paintings, (33) silversmith supplies, (34) silver thread, etc. Therefore, the above goods cannot be easily transported to Singapore in the future. However, for each importer, if the goods are ordered before September 14, they must register with the customs within two days and present evidence, such as telegrams, bookkeeping letters, etc., that can prove the order, and can still obtain an import permit. As for the goods that can be imported other than the above 34 types of prohibited items, the permission of the authorities must first be obtained, otherwise it is impossible to import or obtain foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Export of National Goods to the South: After Singapore's control of foreign exchange and restrictions on imports, it has a great relationship with the life and economy of overseas Chinese. It is very important to allow the export of Shanghai national goods to the south. Because at this time of domestic sales depression, the only way out is to various places in Nanyang, and all parties attach great importance to it. Overseas Chinese merchants in Nanyang are very excited to purchase and use national goods. According to recent statistics, there are more than 120 companies engaged in national goods, including silk and cotton cloth. There are restrictions on this, and now it is even more prohibited, which is even more severe. Pottery has always been shipped from Shantou. Since the fall of Shantou, few goods have arrived. The glass business is quite good and will be affected. The amount of cotton textiles imported is very large. Regarding electrical appliances, the import of light bulbs is subject to very strict inspections. Wood is not easy. Electrical wires are not allowed to be imported, but there are still many other electrical materials. Leather goods are mainly suitcases. In recent years, many cosmetics have also been exported to Nanyang. Therefore, the goods that are prohibited from import have a very important relationship to the entire export of national goods in Shanghai. Therefore, overseas Chinese leaders are paying close attention to seek aftercare and are negotiating with the local government by the Consul-General in Singapore, Gao Lingbai, so that national goods can travel smoothly. However, there are still many places that need explanation regarding the item decree. If Shanghai manufacturers have any difficulties regarding this problem, they can write to Jin Nanhang, 46A Keening Street, Singapore. This company was founded by Shanghai industry leaders and specializes in the export trade of national goods. It is hosted by Mr. Gao Shiheng, so you can directly write to Mr. Gao, which will definitely be more detailed and clear.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Houses Were Open Yesterday, All Industries Are Preparing for Matters at the End of October</h3>
<p>With financial stability, Shanghai industries safely passed the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement period. Various markets such as foreign exchange, gold, securities, yarn, flowers, groceries, etc., and various banks and money houses were all opened yesterday. However, because the long-term loan period of credit at the end of October is approaching, all industries have begun to prepare for matters at the end of October. The Silver Industry Association has scheduled a meeting on October 25 to discuss the internal market, and has separately consulted with various industries on loan and collection at the end of October.</p>
<h3>Chen Weida's Home Robbery Case, The Suspect Was Found Not Guilty, The Police Lawyer Withdrew the Prosecution, The Defendant Was Allowed to Be Released on Bail Pending Instructions</h3>
<p>Chen Weida, a local Catholic living at No. 13, Lane 170, Route Lafayette, was robbed by four thieves at about 7:00 AM on the 6th of this month, and more than 1,000 yuan in cash and goods were taken away. At 6:00 PM on the 12th, Chen's daughter, Bangqian, and the maid, Wang Abao, pointed out Shao Zuoyan, a pedestrian on the tram stop at the intersection of Route Lafayette and the vegetable market, as one of the robbers (28 years old, from Ningbo, working at a store in the Broadway Mansion). Shao was detained by the police and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to law. The case was tried twice by Judge Miao Qingbang, and the hearing was adjourned for further investigation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the hearing was continued. The defendant, Shao Zuoting, hired lawyer Ai Zhenlin to defend him. The plaintiff, Chen Bangqian, and the maid, Wang Abao, came to court and firmly claimed that the defendant was indeed one of the robbers at the time, and they recognized him very clearly. The defendant, Shao Zuoting, absolutely denied being a thief. He claimed that he was on duty at the Broadway Mansion at the time of the robbery and requested an investigation. Subsequently, Dong Abao, Li Guangneng, Wang Changming, Wang Jinsheng, Zhou Jintang, and a British female secretary of the Broadway Mansion, who were colleagues of the defendant, came to court to testify that Shao was working at the Broadway Mansion, working in room 1107 from the 8th to the 14th from 1107 to 1114, going to work at 7:00 AM every morning and leaving work at 7:00 PM. He was on duty on the morning of the 6th, etc. According to Shao's confession, he was going to his aunt's house at No. 5 Sanyu Lane, Route Lafayette, to see his wife when he was arrested. Because his wife was out and the space inside the house was small, it was inconvenient to stay, so he waited at the tram stop, which led to the mistaken arrest. The court also summoned the second landlord Peng Cao of No. 5 Sanyu Lane and Shao's wife for questioning. At this point, the police lawyer expressed his opinion that according to the defendant's confession and the testimony of witnesses, the defendant was not suspected of being a thief and requested to withdraw the prosecution orally first, and then supplement the written request. Judge Miao immediately approved the request and ordered the defendant to pay a guarantor of 2,000 yuan to be available upon call pending instructions.</p>
<h3>Murdering the Pawnshop Accountant, The Convicted Criminal Appeals, Denies Being an Accomplice and Asks for Forgiveness, The Court Adjourned the Trial Pending Judgment</h3>
<p>Ye Shizhong, from Dongting Mountain in Suzhou, had an irreconcilable feud with Tang Shenglin, the accountant of Fuchang Pawnshop at No. 122 Zilaihuo Street. Therefore, on April 28 of this year, he opened a room at the Grand Hotel and invited his friends Zhou Jie and Ye Chunnian to have dinner. After cutting their hair and vowing revenge, they went to join the army in Chongqing. At about 10:00 PM that night, each holding a sharp knife, they went to Fuchang Pawnshop and hacked Tang to death. Tang was hacked more than 50 times all over his body. After the case occurred, the French Concession police received a report and ordered detectives to investigate, recovering the blood-stained clothes and murder weapons left by the murderer. In the blood-stained clothes of the murderer, two pawn tickets were found. Based on the clues of the pawn tickets, the residence of Shen Huilian, the mistress of the murderer Ye Shizhong, was found at No. 209 Caishi Road and Shen was arrested. Subsequently, Ye Chunnian, an accomplice, was arrested in Shen's home, while Ye Shizhong and Zhou Jie both escaped without a trace. Later, the French police found that Shen Huilian was not a murderer and did not prosecute her. Ye Chunnian was prosecuted for murder. The case has been tried and sentenced by Judge Miao Qingbang to Ye Chunnian for joint murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Ye refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Yang Ruinian to appeal for him. At about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Wu Tingqi, the head of the Criminal Court of the High Branch Court, accompanied by two judges, Gu and Wang, opened the Fifth Court for trial. Ye Chunnian confessed that he was 21 years old, from Dongting Mountain. He used to be a pawnshop clerk. In recent years, he became unemployed due to the war. He was friends with Ye Shizhong. On the evening of April 18 of this year, he followed Ye Shizhong, Zhou Jie, and Bai Xiang. Unexpectedly, they went to Fuchang Pawnshop to fight. The appellant had not premeditated beforehand and did not help during the incident. As for the previous confession in the police station, it was out of necessity. The original trial sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment, which was really unjust. Subsequently, Jiang Haoqing, an apprentice at Fuchang Pawnshop, testified that Ye Chunnian was an accomplice, vividly describing the events. The court also questioned witnesses Wang Yuanmao, Liu Wenbin, and Shen Huilian. After the questioning, the debate began. The prosecutor advocated sentencing the appellant to death. Lawyer Yang Ruinian asked to declare the appellant not guilty. The court adjourned the trial pending judgment.</p>
<h3>Demanding a Loan, Actually Assaulted, Two Defendants Fined</h3>
<p>Xia Huaixian from Nanjing and He Zhenjia from Guangdong were apprentices at Feng Shunchang Paint Factory set up by Feng Zeshen from Guangdong at No. 21 Xinyu Village, Gordon Road, Changping Road, Shanghai. Now that Xia and others have completed their apprenticeships, they have left Feng and set up an Acrylic Paint Construction Company in Room 109 and 810, Yuanmingyuan Road. At the beginning of April this year, Xia borrowed 1,100 yuan from Feng, stating that it would be repaid in installments within one year, but no money has been repaid so far. Therefore, at 10:35 AM on the 19th of the month, Feng ordered his son, Feng Shouhua, to go to Acrylic Company with a receipt to collect the arrears. Xia immediately snatched the receipt and tore it up to achieve the purpose of evading debt. Feng Shouhua intended to take it back, which resulted in Xia and He violently beating him, causing injuries to his left chest and tearing his clothes. Feng Shouhua reported to the General Patrol Room, and Chinese detective Ma Guangqi confirmed the facts. He immediately reported to the First Special Court for the issuance of a summons, and Xia and He were summoned to the Fourth Criminal Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted them for injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Law, and Feng Shouhua also hired lawyer Zuo Detao to file an incidental civil suit, requesting compensation for medical expenses and a suit of clothes, totaling 300 yuan and 6 jiao. When questioned, the two defendants admitted to beating the plaintiff and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. After questioning by Judge Zhong Qing, it was ruled that Xia and He were each fined 10 yuan and compensated the plaintiff for medical expenses, etc.</p>
<h3>Guard's Handgun Was Robbed</h3>
<p>At the corner of Jiaozhou Road and Binlang Road, at about 6:00 PM yesterday, a guard of No. 94 was passing by when he was suddenly stopped by two robbers. One of the robbers took out a handgun and ordered him to disarm. The guard was caught off guard and the handgun he was wearing was robbed by the barehanded robbers, who fled without a trace. The guard could not catch up and immediately reported to the competent police station to file a report and start tracking down the robbers.</p>
<h3>Autumn Coolness Intensifies, Huangpu River Tomorrow's High Tide</h3>
<p>After the weather in this city turned autumnal coolness, yesterday was the first day of coldness, because the autumn rain ended all day the day before yesterday, and yesterday it suddenly became sunny and cold. The high tide of the Huangpu River is still continuing today, and tomorrow's tide is expected to be even higher, because the tide on the 18th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar is traditionally the crown of the autumn flood, reaching its peak. In fact, this is not always the case, but the amount of high tide on this day is also very large, which is worth noting.</p>
<h3>Foreman Was Cut</h3>
<p>In a workshop of the Asia Petroleum Company in Pudong, Chen Jihua, a foreman from Hubei, 50 years old, was talking to his mistress Yin (40 years old) at home at about 8:30 PM last night when suddenly more than a dozen workers arrived. Without asking the reason, they raised axes and cut Chen's head twice, his neck once, his left arm three times, and his left leg once. Yin's left knee bone was also cut once. After being injured, the two could not support themselves and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, left triumphantly. Afterwards, someone bought a boat to Shanghai and took them to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported to the Central Police Station, which sent agent No. 337 to investigate. It is understood that Chen Jihua usually relied on his power to oppress workers, which aroused public outrage and caused this secret assault.</p>
<h3>Touching Crabs and Catching Iron Balls, One Throw Exploded, Zhu Gengsheng Was Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Zhu Gengsheng, 39 years old, living in a flat house near Jiwang Temple, Dongfahua Town, was touching crabs in a small stream in front of his door at about 7:00 AM yesterday morning when he suddenly picked up an iron ball from the river. After inspecting it for a long time, he did not know what it was, so he slammed it against a stone on the shore. The iron ball exploded on the spot as soon as it was slammed. Zhu was unable to avoid it in time, and his chest and arms were seriously injured. Later, his family took him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Autumn Racing News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club's autumn horse racing is scheduled to begin on Saturday tomorrow. Because excellent teachers and horses from Tianjin, Wuhan and other places are participating in this session, the situation will be even more lively. In addition to the solo win horse position ticket, for those who start within eight horses, the "Accumulated Place" will be sold as usual. The sales performance of the Ace Champagne ticket is very good, the price remains the same, and one yuan will be extracted from each whole ticket as usual as a disaster relief donation. The lottery department of the club at No. 30 Horse Road and Mashuo Road will sell it on race days. Also, the first issue of the Shanghai Horse News compiled and distributed by the club will be published tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>After reading the report on the 27th of this month that a young boy died of typhoid fever, and there was a question about the previous medicine, the facts are slightly different. Zhang hired a doctor surnamed Jiang to diagnose and treat him in this hall on the 6th of this month, and commissioned this hall to decoct the medicine on his behalf. On the 8th, he changed to doctor Zhang Yijun for diagnosis and treatment. After taking the medicine, he decocted it himself. As for Ju Jielin's agent to hire a doctor, there is no such thing. Zhang Hongjin's illness gradually recovered on the 16th of the same month, but his illness relapsed due to food carelessness. According to the report, he hired doctor Jiang for a follow-up consultation on the 23rd of the same month. The date is two weeks apart. How can there be a follow-up consultation? Dr. Jiang did not have a follow-up consultation, and the patient decocted the medicine himself. Why is it said that it was decocted on his behalf and the prescription was mistaken? This is specially written to request a correction. Sincerely, Tian Ji Tang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store, September 28.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory predicted at 4:30 PM yesterday that the weather in Shandong and the East China Sea would change from cloudy to overcast, with northeasterly winds and showers. The weather here will change from cloudy to overcast, with strong northwesterly to northerly winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 72.5 degrees and the lowest was 57.7 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 81.7 degrees and the lowest was 69.6 degrees.</p>
<h3>Student Conspired with Detectives to Beat a Classmate Case, The Victim's Injury Is Serious, The Fate is Unknown, The Hearing Is Postponed, The Defendant's Request for Bail Is Not Allowed</h3>
<p>Zou Zhengzhi, the class leader of the third grade of the private Shanghai Middle School on Chengdu Road, usually disagreed with his classmate Fang Yimou. At 10:30 AM on the 20th of this month, he conspired with his former classmates Wang Biqing, Chinese detective No. 301, and Li Boqing, Chinese detective No. 215, who are now serving in the French Police Station, to severely beat Fang in the school dormitory, causing serious injuries. After the incident, Chinese detective Hua Guo and detective Wang Shidong of the Xinzha Police Station went to arrest Zou, Wang and Li and detained them in the First Special Court. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang said that the victim Fang Yimou's injury has not yet been out of danger, and his fate is unknown. The hearing should be postponed. The defendant Zou Zhengzhi hired lawyer Jin Yu to come to court and requested bail. Judge Chuan said that the victim's life and death are unknown, and the case is of great importance. He ruled that the three defendants should still be returned to custody and the hearing should be postponed to October 13. The request for bail was not allowed.</p>
<h3>Jian De Bank Bankruptcy Case, Xie Keming, Yu Yuanxiang and Others Were Sentenced</h3>
<p>Shanghai Jian De Commercial Savings Bank was adjudicated bankrupt by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court in July of the 24th year of the Republic of China. Accountant Li Ding was selected as the bankruptcy administrator. Before and after the bankruptcy, the creditors and the bank's directors and supervisors had filed lawsuits and disputes endlessly. For example, the directors Xie Keming and others were sentenced to fines ranging from 1,000 yuan to 1,500 yuan for making false statements during the capital increase registration and for not filing for bankruptcy when the company's assets were insufficient to pay off debts, and were jointly liable for compensating more than 240,000 yuan of false capital. The registration of its limited company was also revoked by the Ministry of Finance and Industry. In January of this year, the creditors Wei Haijiang and Wang Ruyao hired lawyers Weng Zhifan, Gu Kenfu, and Mi Gegu to file a criminal lawsuit against Xie Keming, Yu Yuanxiang, Yan Fangfang, and Qin Wenqun for crimes such as collusion between the bankrupt and the bankruptcy administrator, representing untrue debts, harming the rights of the bankruptcy estate and bankruptcy creditors, and privately receiving loans, altering account books and forging signatures, and requesting a sentence. Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Third Criminal Court, because the facts were complicated, summoned more than 40 witnesses and opened more than 20 courts. The judgment was announced the day before yesterday. Xie Keming and Yu Yuanxiang were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment for jointly using forged documents, and each to one year of imprisonment for jointly committing breach of trust. The sentence for each should be executed for one year and two months. Yan Fangfang and Qin Wenqun were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment for jointly committing breach of trust, with a three-year suspended sentence. Most of the creditors of the bank are residents of Zhabei and Hongkou, and workers on both roads. After the war, they have suffered a lot of displacement. Since the bank's bankruptcy, creditors have complained. Now that the inside story of its bankruptcy fraud has been revealed, the bankruptcy event may need to be reprocessed.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Abandoned Her Husband and Ran Away, Came to Shanghai and Remarried, The Original Husband Found Out and Reported the Case to the Police</h3>
<p>Chen Shanhua (28 years old) from Nanjing married Tao Fengying (22 years old), a woman from the same village, through a matchmaker in his early years in his hometown. Unexpectedly, in the summer of the year before last, Tao took away cash and clothing, etc., and ran away from her husband. Chen inquired everywhere, but there was no news. Until June last year, a friend told him that his wife Tao had changed her name to Hang Xiaomei and was now cohabiting with Guan Zhaokui (26 years old, from Nanjing), Chinese policeman No. 685 of the French Police Station, in Shanghai, as if they were husband and wife. After Chen learned of this, he made a special trip to Shanghai. However, Shanghai is vast and complicated, and it is not easy to find her. On the one hand, a friend introduced Chen to work as a partner in the tiger stove at No. 50 Laosenfu Road. It was not until the 22nd of this month that he found out the hiding place of his wife and Guan. However, after Tao met him, she firmly denied that she was Chen's runaway wife. The two sides wrestled each other to the French Police Station. As a result, the police chief ordered Tao to hand Chen a certificate and lead him back to the case. After Chen left the police station, he sent his wife Tao to live with relatives. Unexpectedly, at about 9:00 PM on the 25th, her lover Guan Zhaokui suddenly led six or seven men to Chen's place and forcibly robbed Tao without asking the situation. Afterwards, Chen reported the information to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest Tao and Guan and bring them to the police station. They were transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday. When questioned, the defendant Tao Fengying confessed that because her husband Chen Shanhua did not engage in proper business and repeatedly decided to abandon her, she came to Shanghai and remarried to Guan through the introduction of relatives and friends. When Guan Zhaokui was interrogated, he confessed that he and Tao were married at the time and had formal marriage certificates, etc. After verifying the confession in court, it was decided that the case would be returned to the police station for investigation before the case was submitted for trial again.</p>

<h3>Today's Shanghai West: Brilliant Lights Shine Like a Lunar Palace, Yet Terrifying Dens of Evil Rival Hell</h3>
<p>It is said that the good Buddhist emperor of China, Tang Minghuang, once dreamt of traveling to the lunar palace. It is also said that the Western poet Dante once entered hell... If these two were to be reborn now, I would invite them to stroll around Shanghai West. There, the brilliant lights shine like a lunar palace. There, terrifying dens of evil rival hell.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a fabrication. If you don't believe me, go and see for yourself. Every three steps there's a "company," and every five steps there's a "club." At night, the reddish lamps cast a red and green glow, like seductive young women beckoning to people. In reality, they are "rotten on the inside," all synonymous with gambling dens and opium houses. As for the exact number, it's simply impossible to count.</p>
<p>Alas, many kind and ignorant people are happily lured in, lose all their money, and dejectedly slink out. The signs on the many telephone poles along the street that say "Building a New Order in East Asia" secretly laugh at them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the pernicious "Flower Guessing Hall" openly displays its signboard, protected by certain forces. The sign lists what "Nine Official" will be opened early, and what "Door Patterns" will be opened in the middle of the day or at night, all prominently displayed. Elaborate ones even have poetic riddles, such as: "Life in this world is but emptiness, what use is there in hoarding wealth?"... It's simply insulting our poets Li Bai and Du Fu. I ask you, what kind of false poet in this world would advise people to send money to ghosts?</p>
<p>Zhaofeng Garden is cold and detached, like a proud chrysanthemum stuck in a pile of dung, or like a chaste young woman coldly watching the "XXX Paradise" across the street, under the protection of the fake police, putting on all sorts of seductive displays, attracting tens of thousands of people, constantly flowing in and out. Indeed, there are lavish decorations, swaying lights, and boisterous sounds... It can truly be said that nothing is lacking. However, they are not filming a movie, but openly cheating people out of their money—gambling with people's lives!</p>
<p>At the crossroads, the positions of the Chinese police have been occupied by the fake police. On the left corner are three fake police officers carrying automatic rifles, and on the right corner stand three patrol officers, all facing each other. For the most part, they can still show some consideration for the Chinese and remain at peace (?).</p>
<p>Most detestable are the gangs of short-clothed ruffians, bare-chested and swaggering. Sometimes, if you pass by, you might be openly robbed even in broad daylight. Only then will you experience what the so-called "new order" construction is all about! (Sick Big Worm)</p>
<h3>Starting with Rebuilding Morality</h3>
<p>— Liu Lang</p>
<p>Yesterday, a morality rebuilding movement held a gathering in Shanghai. Examining its intentions, they are extremely good. Once morality is respected by the world, all robbery and slaughter will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>However, in the past two or three years, morality has long been swept away. Robbers naturally disregard morality, and victims cannot obtain the assistance of the world's morality. From then on, unreasonable arguments prevail over public reason, and the survival of the fittest has almost become a very legitimate thing.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about world events, just the current situation in Shanghai. The so-called robber spirit, through more than two years of historical lessons, has influenced the general merchants. Merchants inherently have merchant morality, but now that morality has been discarded, it also takes making profit as a prerequisite. The chaos in the commercial situation a month ago is a clear proof.</p>
<p>"It's not against the law to do business!" is a very common slogan in the mouths of merchants. When you discover that what you get is far from what you paid for when buying goods, and you argue with the merchant, the merchant will definitely explain his slogan very confidently, such as: "My things are also bought with money!" "My things are not robbed or stolen!" "It is right to make money in business!" "If you are not satisfied, you can go to the court to sue me!" Even if you have been cheated badly, it is difficult to argue. If you go to court to sue, they are reputable merchants and are unlikely to be approved. Moreover, who would go to great lengths for trivial matters?</p>
<p>If this kind of merchant spirit is promoted and expanded, it will have various different consequences. For example: promoting domestic goods in name but actually selling inferior goods. Speculating and manipulating, hoarding for profit. Furthermore, using reputable merchants as a front, secretly attempting to be heroes and heroines in troubled times! Who can say "no"? They are "doing business without breaking the law"!</p>
<p>Regarding this kind of abnormal development, there is nothing wrong with us advocating rebuilding morality. Unfortunately, it is like playing the lute to a cow, its effect is equal to a breeze in the ear.</p>
<p>Morality must be maintained. However, this cannot be achieved by empty talk or a piece of declaration. Being able to formulate new legal laws based on morality, with strength as the backing for enforcing the laws, then major issues such as robbery and slaughter, and minor issues such as manipulating for profit, can all be subject to severe legal sanctions. All bad tendencies will naturally gradually come to an end.</p>
<h3>Electric Wire (Poetic Machinery Talk)</h3>
<p>— Ru</p>
<p>What was definitely noticed by the poets of the time was "electric money."</p>
<p>One of the most widely circulated was "Shanghai Little Ballads," one of four chapters by Misty Viewing Flowers Guest:</p>
<p>Loving the jasper peach blossoms,</p>
<p>I sing of the white round fan.</p>
<p>Electric wires lie dormant beneath the sea,</p>
<p>Who can see them coming and going?</p>
<p>It is an imitation of the Midnight Wu Song. However, this does not express the author's understanding of the electric wire itself. On this point, the old owner of Twenty-Three Rooms' "Shanghai Good" understood it more deeply:</p>
<p>Shanghai is good, the electric wire is as fast as thunder.</p>
<p>Languages are spoken face to face across thousands of miles,</p>
<p>Information is heard instantly across the oceans.</p>
<p>The machinery is invisible.</p>
<p>The function of the electric wire is written more broadly, not limited to personal affairs. Wu Rongsen's "Three Poems on Current Affairs," one of which is "Electric Wire," is written in more detail. Such as "Suddenly hearing distant voices in the empty valley," such as "News is like the wind passing through a flute," such as "Thousands of giant trees appear scratching the sky, traveling thousands of miles like lightning," are all very relevant and more comprehensive. It is a pity that it concludes with praising the imperial court, inevitably inviting ridicule as a "stereotyped poem." Anonymous' "Four Poems of the Foreign Field," one of which is "Electric Wire," has similar content:</p>
<p>How does electricity reach?</p>
<p>Heaven's secrets are not easily understood.</p>
<p>Connecting across thousands of miles,</p>
<p>News is instantly known.</p>
<p>Stealing the power of thunder,</p>
<p>Only to explore the clues of the wire.</p>
<p>From now on, sending letters,</p>
<p>No longer relying on carp letters.</p>
<p>This is a "window lesson" that mixes science and superstition into one. Gu, most of the works praising "electric wires" at the time reflected such thoughts and unprincipled surprise. In the early days of opening up the seas, it was not surprising. Wang Zhichun's "Telegram" written during his travels in Japan is no exception, also saying:</p>
<p>Why bother with ink and painstaking effort?</p>
<p>A wire carries sound across thousands of miles.</p>
<p>Mountains and lakes can all conduct electricity,</p>
<p>Traveling back and forth without relying on the wind.</p>
<p>Human ingenuity is too clever, Heaven should be jealous,</p>
<p>Few words, but the meaning is all-encompassing.</p>
<p>Crossing the three thousand weak waters is easy,</p>
<p>To send messages to Penglai for me.</p>
<p>However, its small preface is excellent, saying: "Electrical telegrams use copper as the wire, with a very small diameter. Using the electricity refined by Westerners, it is either erected on wood or placed in water, extending it. Both ends are connected to machines. The sound transmitted travels through the wire, reaching thousands of miles in an instant." The impression given is clearer than his poem.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of poetry, Misty Viewing Flowers Guest's work is still the first choice.</p>
<p>The remaining three chapters of Misty Viewing Flowers Guest's "Shanghai Little Ballads," one praising "electric lights," one praising "machinery," and one praising "light gas balloons," all mix "machinery" and "love" into one, making them excellent early works of machinery entering poetry. They are also attached here:</p>
<p>Don't use glass as a mirror,</p>
<p>Don't waste kerosene lamps.</p>
<p>Only illuminate the lover's face,</p>
<p>Do not illuminate the lover's heart. (1)</p>
<p>Yesterday, brocade flowers on brocade,</p>
<p>Today, thorns on the road.</p>
<p>The iron factory gave birth to the lover's heart,</p>
<p>How can machinery be measured? (2)</p>
<p>The bright moon does not stay bright for long,</p>
<p>Good flowers do not stay good for long.</p>
<p>Strange light gas balloons,</p>
<p>They will fall with the wind. (3)</p>
<h3>An Urgent Motion</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>A few days ago, the newspaper reported that the Ningbo Native Association and Mr. Yu Qiaqing, in view of the current very depressed industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai, and the high prices and difficult living conditions, specifically wrote to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce to persuade fellow villagers not to come to Shanghai easily, lest they be unable to make a living and become vagrants in Shanghai..." I think this advice is extremely meaningful. From this advice, I feel that there is indeed a need to go a step further and expand it.</p>
<p>In the past, it was indeed easier to make a living in Shanghai, because many people came to Shanghai barefoot, and after only a few years of struggle, they became very influential people. There was no shortage of people who even made a fortune and leaped into becoming wealthy tycoons. The performance of this fact made everyone regard Shanghai as a place "paved with gold," so they all ran to Shanghai. However, since the war, Shanghai has become a safe haven for refugees. Life in the interior and the occupied areas is so difficult, and Shanghai has always been called a place paved with gold, so not going to Shanghai to seek a way out would be too great a loss. As a result, the rapid increase in population has made it the most densely populated city in the world. However, is today's Shanghai really a place "paved with gold"? With rising prices and the decline of industry and commerce, Shanghai itself is in danger of collapsing, so wanting to make a fortune in Shanghai is really a pipe dream. Even seeking a place to eat is as difficult as climbing to the sky, so Mr. Yu Qiaqing was able to warn his fellow villagers not to come to Shanghai easily, which is indeed a very insightful wake-up call. Moreover, in recent months, the newspapers have been constantly reporting tragic news of suicides caused by people coming to Shanghai from afar and being unable to make a living, which is the most concrete example. Now I sincerely hope that the remaining native associations in Shanghai of various counties may all come up with earnest advice, warning fellow villagers not to rush to Shanghai rashly. As Mr. Yu Qiaqing said: "...Rather than coming to Shanghai and being unable to make a living and becoming a vagrant, wouldn't it be better to find opportunities in your hometown?" This kind of advice is not only the duty of the various native associations, but also a praiseworthy deed.</p>
<p>As for us, we should also always advise our fellow villagers, telling them in detail the truth about the "isolated island." This can supplement the inadequacies of the native associations' letters of advice. If we can all implement this, I think the number of such suicide incidents on the "isolated island" may decrease.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Revive Medical Studies, Establishing a School; Thinking of Expanding Village Governance, Entrusting Children to Have a Place</p>
<p>Zhu Ai-ren then called Wu Junsu, knowing that she had already returned to her dormitory. Because today was only Thursday, it was good to arrange it earlier. There was a telephone on Ai-ren's desk. She picked it up, dialed the Suzhou Telephone Bureau, and then transferred to the Dongwu University faculty and staff dormitory. In a moment, she was talking to Wu Junsu. Ai-ren said, "Did you receive Jin Danyu's wedding invitation?" Junsu said, "I received it long ago. It's awful, she didn't mention it when she came to see the play last Saturday night. Now the invitation to the wedding banquet has suddenly arrived. When are you planning to go?" Ai-ren said, "Exactly! We wanted to ask you when you are going? Because the two He sisters and I are planning to go on Saturday afternoon. Because we all have some other things besides attending the wedding banquet. I don't know if you are going on Saturday afternoon? If you are also going on Saturday, we can go together, we will come to see you at the school. We will decide what time to take the train, and we can have some fun on the train." Junsu said, "Saturday afternoon is fine, anyway, I don't have class on Saturday afternoon. She also gave a ticket to my sister Junke. She originally didn't want to go, but I persuaded her to go play together. You say what time to take the train, I can do it here." Ai-ren and the He sisters discussed and said, "Let's take the three o'clock train. At first, Danyu said that she wanted to be thrifty this time, but now the place is rented at the Universal Hotel, which is the largest hotel in Shanghai, can she still be thrifty? This is a very lavish wedding." Junsu said, "This cannot be blamed on her, I am afraid that she also has no choice. Because her occupation is like this, she is associating with the first-class foreigners all day long. Knowing that she is getting married, they all want to come to her wedding banquet. It is not good to be too stingy in entertaining foreign friends, this is a matter of national dignity. Fortunately, Jin Danyu is fine, she has a backer, her backer is very strong, definitely not an iceberg as people say." Ai-ren said, "Who is the backer you are talking about? Isn't it Mrs. Su Liya?" Junsu said, "How can it not be? Old Mrs. Su simply treats her like her own daughter. Although she has a biological daughter in her own country, she is no less to Danyu than to her own daughter. Yu Danyu is considered Old Mrs. Su's Chinese daughter, do you agree? This time, Danyu is getting married, and she is the host. Because Danyu's father was a martyr, and the old lady has also passed away. Probably Danyu wants to be thrifty, but Old Mrs. Su does not agree, she insists on being lavish. They Americans are of course the most generous people in the world." (186)</p>

<h3>Ms. Jin Suqin's Autobiography: Fourteen Years of Acting (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Leng Fang Records</p>
<p>Editor's Introduction: Jin Suqin, from Hangzhou, specializes in Qingyi roles, excelling in both singing and acting. Her beauty and talent are unmatched. She is known as "The Number One Female Dan of Jiangnan," a well-deserved and genuine reputation. Her dedication to improving Peking Opera demonstrates her innovative thinking and extraordinary aspirations, which are worthy of attention and appreciation.</p>

<p>Random Notes of an Artist</p>
<p>Acting is truly a very difficult and arduous job! Recalling my childhood when I began to learn acting, and dedicating myself to the stage, nearly twenty years have passed. I have traveled more than ten thousand miles. Speaking from experience, it seems that I should be considered quite rich; but in terms of art, I am very ashamed to have only gained a false reputation. I have not achieved anything that I can feel grateful and happy about.</p>
<p>Learning to Act at Seven Years Old</p>
<p>When I was a child, I started learning to act at the age of seven, specializing in female roles—Qingyi and Huashan. In order to concentrate on practicing acting and not be distracted, I did not study at that time; when I grew up, I realized this mistake. Although I immediately worked hard to study on my own and continued to strive forward, my knowledge and application of writing are still very superficial, and I feel it is very insufficient. Now, when I read newspapers every day and often read new literary books, such as novels by famous authors such as Ba Jin, to pass the time, I cannot help but often deeply feel the pain of not studying when I was young.</p>
<p>Traveling All Over the North and South</p>
<p>My acting life began when I was ten years old, when I first performed on stage in Changsha. Since then, I have traveled to various ports along the Yangtze River, and spent a long time in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and even as far south as Fujian and Guangdong, for a total of five or six years. In 1929, I first came to Shanghai, working at the former Samsung Stage, and performing the continuous plays "Water Margin" and "Peng Gong'an" with Mr. Zhao Ruquan and others for three full years. Later, I went to Wuhan twice, and to the three northeastern provinces and Beijing-Tianjin twice for nearly two years. In 1936, I returned to Shanghai and was hired by the Golden Grand Theater to cooperate with Mr. Li Wanchun for three months, and then transferred to the Gong Stage for one month. The following year, I sang at the Tianchan Stage for nearly half a year. Later, after the "August 13th" incident, I worked with Mr. Ouyang Yuqian to improve Peking Opera, performing in Shanghai for nearly two months. Last winter, I was hired by the "Golden Theater," and soon after, I went to Hong Kong. This wandering acting life has lasted for a total of fourteen years.</p>
<h3>"Renewal" After the Renewal: A Record of the First Night of Peking Opera Performance</h3>
<p>— Nai Wo</p>
<p>The Renewal Stage has been completely renewed, sending people north to invite a large number of Peking Opera performers, who began to meet the people of Shanghai on the Mid-Autumn Festival. That evening, the seats were sold out. Mr. Zhang Shankun accompanied the four major movie stars Chen Yunshang, Li Minghui, Tong Yuejuan, and Chen Yanyan to watch the play, which added a lot of color to the theater. The reporter was also one of the guests. Upon arriving at the theater, Li Duokui's Fishing for a Golden Turtle had already reached its finale. Duokui has not come south for many years, and his voice is as loud as before, so he is very popular with the audience. Following Fishing for a Golden Turtle, Liang Huichao's Picking the Carriage came on stage. Huichao is one of the rising martial artists, only nineteen years old, and his waist and leg skills are excellent. His leg is comparable to Wang Shaolou of the Gong Stage. However, he is full of sea air, which is undesirable. Although he can cater to the audience's tastes, Liang likes to show off his waist and leg skills, so his poses and movements are often the same. He can only be called a "charger." His temper has not faded, and his skills are still shallow. His voice is still a boy's voice, which is a disadvantage because he cannot project it. However, he is still a talented person and can be expected to achieve great things in time. Chen Shaolin had previously come to Shanghai with Cheng Yanqiu, but failed to leave a deep impression on the people of Shanghai. Watching Shaolin perform Catching and Releasing at the Inn last night, he has indeed improved compared to before. His body is no longer as stiff as before. It is a pity that his voice is not loud enough (the tone is not low, but sitting behind the sixth row, it is not easy to hear clearly), so phrases such as "His family has suffered disaster" cannot be sung high, and it seems not very pleasing to the ear. It may be that Shaolin's capital is insufficient, or it may be due to travel fatigue. The large slow board of the inn scene was the most moving, and it can be said that Shaolin sings Erhuang better than singing Xipi. Li Chunheng's Cao Cao is completely in the style of Hao. He is more like Hao Shouchen than Yuan Shihai. However, some strange tones make the audience laugh, as if listening to Yan Jupeng's first tone. The finale, Four or Five Flower Caves, features Liang Yunqiu and Li Wanyun as the real Pan Jinlian, and Wu Ziqiu and Zhao Jinrong as the fake Pan Jinlian. The four-sentence slow board of "Pan Jinlian cannot help but be annoyed" is not that each of the two sings two sentences. The real Pan Jinlian sings the first sentence, and the fake Pan Jinlian repeats the first sentence. This undoubtedly shows their abilities and forms a confrontation, which is rarely seen on stage. In terms of singing, Zhao Jinrong is not inferior to Wu Suqiu, while Li and Liang are slightly worse, so the applause for the real Pan Jinlian is not as much as for the fake Pan Jinlian. In terms of appearance, Wu Suqiu is the best among the four. Apart from Wu, Li Wanyun is graceful and charming. In addition, the body movements and stage steps of the four are all excellent, which is worth noting for a reporter. Sun Shengwu's county magistrate is full of humor and is a handsome man among the clowns. It is said that the plan for the Renewal Stage is that Wu, Zhao, and Liang will take turns performing, each singing for ten days. These three each have their own strengths, and there is no shortage of people who support them, so it is expected that their appeal will not be weak.</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>A Frivolous Sin</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua "Bachelor Mother"</p>
<p>After watching "A Frivolous Sin," I was indeed attracted by this clever story, and couldn't help but smile knowingly at the advertising posters at the door. But in the line of cars, suddenly a old woman emerged, carrying a scantily clad child in her arms, begging the gentlemen and ladies. The old woman's painful face and sobbing voice seemed to be the same as the woman in "A Frivolous Sin" who abandoned the baby. So, my thoughts returned to this clever story. When everyone is laughing at this funny story, who notices the woman who abandoned the child? If our vision can jump over the camera and follow the woman, what will we see? But the playwright is clever. He abandoned the protagonist of "A Frivolous Sin" and made us forget her.</p>
<p>Hollywood is now competing to shoot comedies, or that is the reason. But no matter how clever the scriptwriting skills, it will eventually expose weaknesses in front of us. The short few feet of film, the fleeting appearance of the woman, also made us see another side of this society: unemployment, poverty, countless hungry and cold faces!</p>
<p>This clever story, after being rendered by the director, is really full of gimmicks. It almost makes the audience's laughter never stop.</p>
<p>Several scenes are even more lovely. Such as (1) Polly is summoned to the manager's office, David allows Polly to be reinstated and increases her salary. The director fully utilizes his skillful comedic skills to develop the different thoughts of David, Polly, and the orphanage staff. (2) On New Year's Eve, David and Polly are separated in the joyful crowd. They see each other across the street but cannot greet each other. So they jump up in the crowd; when the two face each other, due to the noise of the surroundings, their words can only be seen through the movement of their lips—these two close-up shots are very novel and accompany the joyful situation of the crowd on New Year's Eve. (3) David's father follows David and mistakes the child for his grandson; and (4) the dispute between father and son at breakfast is extremely humorous. Finally, the reunion is brought about by the child dropping a toy duck, which also shows the director's cleverness.</p>
<p>Qing Shu Luo Jisi has already let us know in "Dragon Gate Flower Moon" that she is not just a singer and dancer. The role of Polly is well played, and the actor who plays Molin is also very good.</p>
<h3>Casual Paintings of the Entertainment World (17)</h3>
<p>— Suzhou Document Writer, Text, Xiu Yan Drawing</p>
<p>The narrative style of the Suzhou Document Writer is no different from that of the ballad singing; the lyrics are unique and completely different: listening to it occasionally, it feels quite refreshing, but listening to it for a long time makes people bored (perhaps this is just my own prejudice).</p>
<p>The representative figure in this is of course Wang Baoqing (in fact, there are only one or two people like this). Once, "Ten Sighs of Emptiness" was popular for a while.</p>
<p>In the past, the Suzhou Document Writer was very popular, but now it has returned from "brilliance" to "plainness."</p>
<h3>Special Record of Shanghai's Song Broadcasting</h3>
<p>— Wanderer</p>
<p>"The moon is especially bright on the Mid-Autumn Festival." This "isolated island" fundamentally has "low pressure" that makes it impossible for you to breathe freely. However, the season has come to the autumn festival of the year.</p>
<p>The banners of "Su Guang Mooncakes" are hung on the city signs of major companies. The autumn wind may blow away some of the shadows in my heart. Dragging my heavy heart, I wanted to drink a few cups of Wujiapi wine or mooncakes during the "Mid-Autumn Festival," but the whip of "real life" does not allow it.</p>
<p>Stepping onto Nanjing Road, I unknowingly entered the New Capital Hotel in the elevator.</p>
<p>The radio broadcast of the opera "Song of Shanghai," organized by the Film Stars Association, will embellish the Mid-Autumn Festival on the Glass Radio!</p>
<p>What is brilliant is a piece of starlight of the film people, there are Bai Hong wearing a red vest, Sun Min giggling, Zhou Manhua delicate, Cai Jin exquisite, dozens of students from the Conservatory of Music, there is one called Zhang Hao who is sweating profusely holding a conductor's whip leading the orchestra to sing!</p>
<p>Apart from Li Jinguang, I can't really forget that violinist who has been naturalized in China, that Mr. Mei Xia who is fifty-four years old. That Brahma Forest, the beautiful solo, deeply intoxicated my whole soul.</p>
<p>There is no "Pastoral Song" to listen to in "Song of Shanghai," but when "I Love the Mountains and Rivers of the Motherland" was played, I could understand why the composer had that song. Isn't the occupied "isolated island" still "full of singing"?</p>
<p>A piece of starlight, is the Mid-Autumn Festival that embellishes the "New Capital."</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden: Actors and Opium</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>In the past and present, many famous actors indulge in opium. The late Mr. Wang, known as Xiao Nong, was particularly addicted. He could smoke two ounces of opium paste daily. It is said that before he would get out of bed, his concubine had to first blow smoke into his face several times while standing beside the bed before he could even begin to stir slightly. A small teapot filled with a little ginseng soup was used to moisten his mouth, and then the prepared opium was fed to him. With his eyes closed, Xiao Nong would inhale a dozen or so puffs before he could slowly open his eyes and speak, put on his clothes, get out of bed, wash his face, and rinse his mouth. Then, he would lie back down and smoke again. When the weather was clear and his spirits were good, he could prepare and smoke the opium himself; otherwise, his concubine would have to do it for him. At this time, he couldn't have breakfast until he had finished dozens of pipes. Therefore, whenever there was a performance at a theater, the owner had to bribe the concubine with a certain amount of money, or she would not be willing to serve him wholeheartedly or urge him to go to the backstage early.</p>
<p>The main reasons why actors are fond of opium are nothing more than the following: (1) It is hereditary. (2) From a young age, they are constantly exposed to it, believing that they cannot become famous actors without smoking it. It is common to see many famous actors lying on the opium couch while teaching their students, instructing them to stand at attention in front of the couch. While teaching the lyrics or correcting a certain melody, their eyes are focused on the lamp, reciting and circling, appearing relaxed and content. When the students memorize the lyrics, they also focus their eyes on it, without glancing away. This is very different from the situation in school classrooms, where the opium couch is like a classroom, the opium tray is like a blackboard, the opium pick is like a teaching whip, and the opium pipe can be used as a handle for swords, spears, or whips. Also, when reciting percussion rhythms, the opium pick can be used to strike the opium tray to represent drums and clappers. Therefore, the teacher teaches lying down, while the student stands respectfully in front of the opium couch to receive instruction. This becomes a habit, and they feel that this way of teaching students is not only very comfortable but also full of style. Once they become a little famous, they cannot help but imitate their teacher's style, acquiring a set of opium paraphernalia and puffing away. It is said that because of the anecdote that Xiao Jiaotian was ordered to smoke opium, it seems that one is not qualified to be called a "Tan School" performer without smoking opium. Therefore, among those who claim to be from the Tan School or disciples of Tan's descendants, I am afraid that ten out of ten are opium addicts. I really can't think of a single one who doesn't smoke. (109)</p>
