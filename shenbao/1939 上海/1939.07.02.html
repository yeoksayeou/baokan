<h3 id="c8">所謂日軍新戰略 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>最近據港電傳述，日方對華戰事有所謂新戰略，即「對陝主攻，對鄂中助攻，對湘贛佯攻，對華南以海軍游攻，對魯南蘇北及華中游擊隊續謀肅淸掃蕩，並傳已限七月初佔領浙東」云云。論理，所謂戰略，不是一種公開亂的計劃，往往由對方或第三者根據情報，或觀察戰局發展的趨向，而加以判別或懸揣；那末日方是否有所謂新戰略，以及新戰略的內容是否確如傳述，還未能十分斷定。可是日軍自從攻佔廣州武漢以來，歷時又已八月有餘，頓兵中原，師老兵敝；雖然中間也曾幾次企圖前進，但是結果無非損兵折將，無法寸展；同時自己國內問題日多，矛盾日深，經濟枯竭，人心杌隍。反觀中國，抗戰轉入新階段，兵力日强，士氣日旺。國際的援助日益加多，國內的人心日益堅定，兩相比較，雖不能說勝負的局數已經確定，但是中國已由黑暗漸入光明，日本已由光明漸入黑暗，那是無可疑問的。因此，日方為挽救自身的頹運，應付戰局的新形勢起見，修正一種戰略，也並非不可能的事。如果這樣，那末日軍的新戰略，事實上也無非是中國抗戰新階段的一種對策；可是這對策已經落後了一步，不免顯示着一種被動的性質。再就最近戰局的實况而論：幾個月內，日軍曾一再進攻襄樊，企圖呼應晋南，夾窺陝洛，然而當晋南日軍無法渡河的時候，鄂北日軍却不等到完全崩潰，就知難而退，潛伏不動。又如本星期內，日軍揚言封鎖中國海全部，然而行動飄忽，不可捉摸，忽而甌港，忽而閩海，而且旣佔玉環川石兩島，忽又自動退出，，但是艦隊仍舊密集，形勢仍舊緊張。由此兩例，可見所謂新戰略裏的「助攻」「游攻」的說法，也不為無因了。</p>
<p>假定日方果有這樣的新戰略，那末除了限期攻佔浙東顯然祇是一種法螺以外，關於其他幾項，我們可以看出如下的幾個要點：第一，所謂主攻，所謂助攻，其目標大概注意在西北；第二，所謂佯攻，所謂游攻，其作用無非在牽制中國的兵力；第三，所謂肅淸，所謂掃蕩，其意義就是鞏固佔領區，解除自身後方的威脅。我們試先就二三兩點來說，就可知日軍對於戰綫的延長，自身兵力的不敷分配，以及中國游擊戰爭的廣泛展開，都抱着極深的戒懼態度。可是事實又吿訴了我們，日軍的這種新戰略，結果決不會發生什麼效力的。因為中國的兵力，在抗戰的過程中已經充分地成長起來，不論質量兩方面都有顯著的進步，如果日軍這邊佯攻，那邊游攻，所牽制的中國兵力能有幾何？但是日軍自身却因此更加增進了不敷分配的困難，結果徒然多掘幾處墳墓，造成幾個殲滅的機會罷了。至於所謂游擊隊的掃蕩與肅淸，在目前誰都知道是一種空想。試看山西省境，日軍幾次三番地淸除游擊隊，但是差不多經過了二十多月的時間，結果除了太原附近地帶以及同蒲鐵路沿綫的狹長區域以外，大部分境地仍在華軍手中。山西如此，魯南蘇北何嘗如此？何况游擊組織日漸嚴密，民衆民族意識日漸堅强的今日，游擊隊越掃蕩必然越會增加起來，更怎樣談得上肅淸？</p>
<p>至於所謂以西北為進攻目標的一點，我們更値得提出來檢討一下。原來日軍自從攻佔廣州武漢以後，就揚言對西北西南同時並進；但經過了數度的碰壁以後，却又東奔西突，變成了漫無目標。現在所謂新戰略裏，却又提出了以西北為進攻的目標，可見已經縮小了攻略範圍，‵不像以前的大言炎炎，這就不啻自承一半失敗了。姑就進攻西北而論，日軍志向果又何在？就常理推測，，日軍進攻西北，不外下列的三種作用，第一，遮斷中蘇交通，並給與蘇聯一種鉅大的威脅。不過日本要達到這項目的，必須深入秦隴，甚至西渡流沙，攻入新疆，才會發生確實的效力，但是日本果有此力量嗎？第二，迂迴包抄，窺伺巴蜀，給中國抗戰新根據地一個最嚴重的威脅，這就是所謂坂垣停戰綫內容的一部分，也是日軍念茲在茲的一種願望。日軍果然要完成這種願望，必須西北西南同時進攻；即使退一步單論西北，也必須囊括漢中，席卷隴南，否則斷難成功。這又豈是疲敝的日軍所能輕易成就？第三，為鞏固黃河中下流起見，必須攻佔關中，一則可以解除目前上流對下游的威脅，二則可以進一步利用建瓴之勢，鎭壓中原。這原是中國歷史上所指示的經騐，秦國以關中作根據地，可以統一中原，項羽放棄了關中，不免垓下的慘敗；日軍現在的念念不忘西北，把陝西為主攻的目標，最重要的作用或祇在鞏固華北的一點上·也未可知。</p>
<p>當兩年前日軍開始發動事的時候，其最初的目標，本來就在所謂華北。後來因為長江戰事的進展，就引起了更大的貪慾。現在所謂新戰略，却又專注在鞏固華北的一點上，那末這新戰略充分暴露着日軍色厲內荏的態度，也可說具有退却性的意味。</p>
<p>日軍進窺西北，不外下列幾條路綫：北路由包頭趨甯夏，襲蘭州；東路由山西渡河攻陝北；束南由晋南渡河截陝洛，再會合豫東軍隊經隴海路正面仰攻：南由襄樊趨漢中或斜出武關。在過去，日軍對於這幾條路綫，有的已經嘗試過而沒有成功，有的却一直不敢輕於嘗試；現在竟要想發揮弩末之勢，企圖達到以前所不能達到的目的，這恐怕日軍自己也不敢說有什麼把握吧！那末所謂新戰略，簡直又是可以預占失敗的戰略了。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）關於中立法問題此間政界各觀察家頃宣稱、共和黨議員伏利斯所提修正案、列入眾議院外交委員會主席白魯姆提案、表决通過、實為政府重大之失敗、緣赫爾國務卿曾迭次聲明、美國當局在新中立法中、對於軍火軍械售予各交戰國一層、不願加以限制、茲伏利斯所提修正案、對於此種貿易、業已提出若干限制、惟其限制辦法、尚待明白規定而已、按羅斯福總統所由此遭此失敗者、其原因厥有三端、（一）共和黨殆已團結一致、此案投票付表决時、該黨議員除某某兩人外、餘均贊成伏利斯修正案、此種一致行動、實乃近數月來所僅見、（二）民主黨議員倒戈者甚眾、非始料所及、（三）民主黨各領袖直至最近始乃向各眾議員說明、白魯姆提案若加以修正、必在國際方面引起重大反響、而伏利斯修正案則足以鼓勵歐洲各侵略國、但此項說明為時太遲、已感不及、所幸此項中立法僅在眾院通過、尚未成為定案、他日提付參院討論時、當可加以補救、惟一般人深恐參院在本屆會期之內、未必提付討論云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）關於中立法問題、眾議院外交委員會主席白魯姆所提法案、頃由眾議院賡續提付討論、南達柯泰州共和黨議員凱斯、對於白魯姆案所　新中立法各項規定、不適用於拉丁美州一款、提出修正案、伊利諾州民主黨議員強森、當即表示反對、謂此項修正案、與美國政府在歷届汎美洲會議中向拉丁美洲各國所接受之約束、實相抵觸云云、嗣用舉手法將修正案否決、坎脫基州共和黨議員勞平生發表演說、反對以軍火接濟各交戰國、略謂、美國第一步接濟軍火、第二步將不得不派兵赴國外作戰、因此對於白魯姆原案所主張廢止軍火禁運辦法、未便苟同云云、麻薩區賽茲州共和黨議員羅傑斯夫人、旋提出修正案、略謂、關於各交戰國軍艦潛艇是否准其駛入美國各港口、按之白魯姆原案、總統得以全權決定、茲宜予以限制、此項修正案、卒為眾議院用舉手法予以否決、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）關於中立法問題眾議院討論已入最後階段、即可切實有所決定、截至目下為止、討論情形、僅足使修正問題混沌不明、曾有議員數人、臨時提出修正案、如共和黨議員伏利斯所提修正案、（禁止軍火與軍用飛機運往交戰國）即其一例、眾議院大多數議員、態度遊移不定、亦可於此見之、查伏利斯修正案、僅主各種軍火與軍用飛機禁止出口、其意乃欲在純粹戰爭利器與各種物品之可用以作戰者之間、有所區分、卒以二票之多數表决通過、於以見赫爾國務卿雖經剴切說明、此種區分無論在情理上或在實際上均不可能、但民主黨眾議員、仍有多人未能了解、或已忘却、此外各眾議員之發表意見者、對於美國態度、足以影響歐洲時局之發展一層、似凂之惟恐不及、所關心者、僅為其所揭棻之見解、能在內國方面發生何種反應、此點頗可注意、要之、討論情形、仍以理論為重、各議員之表示意見者、均不願制定一種法律、在他日各交戰國之間作左右袒、務欲阻止美國、勿令捲入戰爭漩渦、此在政府方面、則因幣制與金融權力之延長時效問題、不免分神、未克以全力應付中立法問題、是又局勢混沌原因之一也、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>日本威脅英國的造因　英輿論主張制裁日本　同時可終結中日戰爭　歐洲通信</p>
<p>（一）極顯明的例證</p>
<p>歐·亞·兩洲命運的不可分離，沒有比最近這兩次事件更能給予有力例證的了。上一次，是兩個多禮拜前，英·法·蘇·協定成立噴囂塵上的，遠東的日本，忽然在外蒙邊境，造出了一個緊張局勢；意思是說：萬一英國逕直與蘇俄成立完全董事同盟的話，那末，牠必得把被牽進去和日本開戰的可能，也先為打算一下。這一用意，英政府立刻就感覺到了，但大多數的反應，却是一笑置之。英·法·蘇·談判的重要性，英國式另有一些大得多的考慮，放在心上的。照當時的情形看，大概目前的日本，和佛朗哥的西班牙加在一處，在英政府的聯蘇與否的利害天秤上，還抵不上一個土耳其來得重。所以，在開始英·蘇··談判的那些天，英國甯願向土耳其加緊接觸，而淡然置之了日本和西班牙。後來，已經成了難以挽回事實的消息一證實，在反對與蘇聯結合的天秤那一端，又大大地減輕了分量。</p>
<p>因了英·蘇·同盟的難產，就順便向日本政府賣弄一下好感，這是事實。又作為他們反對與蘇聯完全結合的藉口之一，往往英國一些人士們，也舉出日本的態度，這也是事實。然而這一回英·蘇·談判的進行與困難，與日本的反對與否，可以說是沒有什麽直接關係。</p>
<p>不過，話雖如此，萬一英·法·蘇·的同盟，今天已經成立的話，那末，在遠東的現在，何至於又出現了日本在天津向英要挾的事件。日本方面，大概是誤解了上一次牠的外蒙邊境示威在英蘇談判困難上的分量了吧，所以，也許牠在想着：如果英國因為畏懼日本的力量，而甚至顧忌和蘇俄同盟的話，那末，由於同樣的畏懼，英國在對於中·日·戰的態度上，還有什麽不能屈服於日本威脅呢？於是，牠就大膽地向英國提出了一個英國萬難接受的要求的澈底和日本合作，造成「東亞新秩序！」</p>
<p>然而，事件也並不是這麼單純。在這時，日本突然來這麼一個舉動，那　源還有大半要歸於目前的歐洲形勢。歐洲的目前形勢，到底如何呢？這不在本文範圍之內，不過那簡括的情形，不妨縮成三點：（一）英·蘇·談判，進展毫無，並且最近的將來，恐怕也沒有大希望；（二）德·意·在歐洲，又在打算另造一個危機了；（三）德·意·對日本拉攏的工作，仍在進行。</p>
<p>任何人現在都看得很明顯：日本這一次的對英要挾，實在是牠對於加入德·意·軸心與否的最後一次討價還價，這一次失敗之後，大概牠是會正式加入德·意·西·集團，而和牠們訂立軍事同盟的。所以這兩天來，日本駐意大使已經到了柏林，和牠的駐德大使合作，與德國當局，保持密切的接觸。同時，在催促德·意·日·西·軍事同盟早日實現的立場上看，希特拉自然是贊成日本向英國張伯倫內閣，作這麼一個最後討價的試驗。</p>
<p>也許，英·法·蘇·的軍事同盟，反會出現在德·日·意·西·的軍事同盟之後吧。</p>
<p>（二）千載一時的好機會</p>
<p>這兩天來，因為日本軍人和浪人在天津的對英儘量侮辱，英國的報章上，已經充滿了這一類的記載。輿論的激昂，可以算是到了極點。可是，如果仔細觀察一下，就立刻可以發現：這一切，並不緊張。現在英國對於日本的經濟·軍備·人力·以及一切的方面，都清清楚楚地，有着正確的估計。英國目前，固然不想同日本作戰；可是，他們因為日本的困難情形，更不敢和英國來一個大規模的衝突，甚至連大規模衝突的危險也不敢　的。</p>
<p>對這事，這兩天來，我和英國的一部份人士，曾經作了許多次的討論。他們一致的結論是；問題的焦點，還是在於張伯倫首相領導下的英國現政府，是否肯下決心；如果的話，那末，縱使想澈底地制裁日本，一舉而終結日本侵略中國的戰爭，也絕不是什麽難事。而且現在正是一個最好時機。</p>
<p>他們的理由，是：（一）英·法·蘇·的同盟，雖然難產，然而牠們的援助中國的立場多少是一致的。那末，在這個同盟難產的時候，正不妨在援助中國這一問題上，先做一個合作的具體試驗，作為未來同盟的第一步驟。（二）美國艦隊，已經調回了太平洋，而目前却又是全體大戰未發，日本對美最恐懼的時候。（三）蘇俄的遠東紅軍，對日本駐滿洲軍力，絕對優勢，而目前却又是德·意·在西方無能為力，日本對蘇俄最害怕的時候。（三）日本對中國的戰事，又完全陷進了被動地位。所以如果張伯倫現政府真是下了決心，打算徹底裁制日本，使牠就範，那末，目前這情形下，辦法是比較單純，可以預算出來的。比如：第一步，先向中國政府接洽一下，由英·蘇·法·美·四國給予大規模物質援助的保證，由中國方面，立刻舉行全面的總攻；第二步，相應着，蘇俄以更大量的軍力，向遠東集中，給予日本一個最致命的威脅；第三步，英·美·法·的遠東海軍，集中某些地域，舉行示威；於是第四步，向日本送一個最後通牒，召開九國會議一類的國際會議，解決一切中·日·間的爭議。這樣一來，那時候，放在日本面前的，祗有兩條路了：不是屈服壓力之下，終止牠的對中國的侵略戰；就是反過來更進一步，加入德·意·西·的軍事同盟。</p>
<p>「也許走後一條路的可能，是多些的吧。」——我說。</p>
<p>「並不一定。因為那樣一來，連德·意·西的同盟，也都很成問題，不能作為日本的靠山了。」何況，最低限度，「這樣子，正可以促成世界反侵略陣綫的正式成立。」</p>
<p>至於中國·美國·法國·以及蘇聯的態度呢，那可以說是不成問題的。祗要英國肯堅決的話。目前情勢是這樣的明顯。英國當局們，對這些，是完全知道的。所以這兩天來，據我們能夠知道和看到的而論，英國向日本提出去的，暗示着的警告，正式地，私人間地，以及輿論方面地，已經在紛紛着了；「危險呀！」「危險呀！」「你的致命點，已經在這裏了呀！」「如果我們一動手的話呀！」……等等。</p>
<p>（三）英現政府的籌思</p>
<p>如果說日本的軍閥們，對上述情勢是完全麻木的，那倒或許不至於；大概是逆料到英國現政府的決不至出上面的一着，所以，方敢對英國放心任意地侮辱起來。可是，我們必須知道，英國在遠東的目前基本立場，無論如何，絕對不會因了日本的擾攘，而有所改變，而況在當前這英·法·蘇·同盟，正在進行中，而中·英·邦交，又是在最密切的時候。英政府現在的唯一籌思，就是：如何在這些綜錯的國際關係裏，找出一個最適於牠自己的途徑，去搪過日本當前的要挾。這些途徑，在英國方面，仍是非常之多的。不過，萬一日本固執已見，錯認英國的舉措不定是原於力弱，還是逼牠合作，創造什麽「東亞新秩序」的話，那末，到最後，英國也許會被迫而採取上說的一個澈底辦法。</p>
<p>我再在這裏重複一遍：想英國和日本合作，創造什麽「東亞新秩序，」依目前情勢，無論從那一個角度看，是萬萬不可能的！萬萬不可能的！（六月十六日自倫敦寄）</p>

<p>— 方子川</p>
<p>醫藥有關民生，而醫院之設立，與公眾衛生，更息息相關。在實行公醫制之國家，醫事統由政府辦理，以保障全民健康為前提，無論都市或鄉村，醫院之分佈，與就地人口相比例，以應需要。即在未實行公醫制之先進國家，醫事亦多由政府統制而調整之；如美國波士頓市，人口約百餘萬，其市立醫院之床位為三千架，除免費治療，並供給血清疫苗等應用藥品，為市民解除疾苦。此外其他各私立醫院，無論貴族式或慈善式，莫不彼此分工合作，以利病人。回顧我國，因醫學教育落後，醫事人材，不敷分配，而衛生署之成立又遲，近年以來，民眾醫藥，雖已由政府倡導，然仍多求治於私立醫院，以及開業藥師。利之所在，人爭趨之，於是醫院設立與醫師開業，但計個人收入，不問勞苦大眾之需要，富人所在之處，即醫事繁盛之區，全國各地，畸形發展，而醫事乃與民眾漸少關係，以致各自為政，系統蕩然。以本市言，市民及外僑人口，超過三百萬，平時病床總數，不滿五千架，醫師學成，競以懸壺開業為能事，醫院設備，頗感供不應求，自二十六年八一三戰事發生以來，傷兵傷民以及難民之醫藥問題，突告緊張，加以外埠避兵來滬者，源源不絕，兩年以內，人口激增，幾相倍蓗，公眾醫藥問題，殊為重要。向在南市閘北虹口各醫院，因戰事關係，紛紛停閉之原有醫院，膨脹萬分，已停閉者，如市中心區市立醫院，公立上海醫院，閘北傳染病院，楓林橋中山醫院，楊樹浦聖心醫院，閔行普慈醫院，江灣澄衷醫院等，或規模較大，或歷史較久，在醫界皆有相當地位。遷租界者如虹口同仁醫院，西門婦孺醫院，虹橋療養院，羅別根路上海衛生療養院，滬軍營東南醫院，大場中華麻瘋療養院等，或遷地擴充，或緊縮範圍，以維現狀，滄桑陵谷，變遷多端，記者會分別訪問，以明真相，其原在租界之醫院，為適應非常需要起見，亦莫不擴充床位，添聘醫師以資應付，此外在租界內新設之醫院，或為社會資助，或為個人經營亦復不少，普通醫院如大公大瑞等，專科醫院如肺癆病院兒童病院產科病院等，故本市醫事情形之複雜，以今茲為最。當戰事劇烈之時，受傷兵民之救護，自為　先要圖，乃由各界人士組織上海市救護委員會負責辦理救護事宜，至國軍西展後，始告結束，其後難民醫療事宜，由中國紅十字會國際委員會及上海慈善團體聯合會辦理，旋於二十七年十一月移交紅十字會總會續辦，此二年來本市醫院動態之大較也。</p>
<p>據已故名醫師美人蘇邁爾言，醫院標準，應以下列五事為斷：（一）組織（二）器械（三）設備（四）醫護人員（五）經費（六）科學工作（七）將來計劃，如以此為衡量之準繩，則本市醫院數量雖無慮數十，而可議之處仍多。記者此次於極短時期內，起草本文，急就之章，難期翔實，一斑之窺，遺珠之憾，在所難免，尚望本市醫界同人諒之。</p>
<p>本文所列之醫院，以記者所參觀者為限，此外本市租界內醫院之具規模者，如西人設立之宏恩公濟兩醫院因對我國病人甚少貢獻，故置弗論，復次俄僑設立之醫院，Russian　Orthodox　Confraternity　Thosptial聞亦收我國難民，彌為可感，惜未參觀。此外國人自設之醫院，如尚賢婦孺醫院，惠旅醫院，（現改為難民醫院）體仁醫院，（教會設）怡和醫院等以及開業醫師附設診治院之帶醫院性質者，如汪企張醫師之療養館，高鏡朗醫師之福幼醫院，王逸慧醫師之產院，石美玉醫師之伯特利醫院，孫克基醫師之產科病院，瞿紹衡醫師之生生醫院，瞿直甫醫師之診病院刁信德醫師之大上海療養院，在社會皆負相當時望，各界人士，知之甚稔，無待介紹，記者因時間關係，未及奉詣，僅此致歉，茲將本市醫院概況，分述如下：</p>

<h3 id="c113">上海蒸汽鍋爐之狀況 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 金芝軒</p>
<p>鍋爐又稱為爐子，一般人對於鍋爐之詳細情形無密切工作關係者，都不很明瞭。即有稍知一二者，亦以為其用途祗限於工廠，故視工廠之是否忙碌，祗問其鍋爐烟囱之是否出烟。自民國十八年來，二十年二十一年二十二年在上海雖屢次有工廠鍋爐爆炸，但其出險亦祗在工廠內，故亦不甚為群眾注意。後來法租界某私娼妓院鍋爐爆炸，炸死多人不久以後，某上海大銀行燒暖汽之鍋爐，又因爆炸傷人，上海之對於鍋爐，又多幾種認識。然採用鍋爐之人，失之無識盲從者固仍多，但神經過敏而懷疑者亦不少。因以愚者一得，供讀者參考，處理鍋爐，既不可疏忽從事，亦殊不宜因噎而廢食。</p>
<p>鍋爐之種類甚多，大都以金屬造成之，用生鐵者固有，但以鐵板或鋼板及鋼管製者為多約分為立式（炮仗），臥式火管式，水管式幾種。再因其用處之不同，分為陸地式船舶式，火車頭式，但其原理則一。水受熱而蒸沸成汽，就理論上言，一方箱（假定為一立方尺）水蒸沸成汽後，在同等大氣壓力下，約能化大容積至一千六百零五方箱。換一句話說，即以一立方尺水，放在四面固封之一千六百零五立方尺容量之器具內燒之，在完全成汽之時，其壓力不變，倘以一立方尺水，加入一只祗有二百三十二立方尺容量之同樣容器內燒之，在成汽之後，內部就生很大漲力，此項漲力，就是蒸汽要從二百三十二立方尺自行澎漲至一千六百零五立方尺而來。當時之漲力，在每平方英尺之面上有一百磅，此即稱為一百磅汽壓，俗話即謂一百磅水汀。如容量放大即減成五十磅，容量若縮小即增為二百磅一次反比例類推。鍋爐者即一鋼鐵製之容器，置水其中，燒之以火，使成蒸汽。平常鍋爐，水之容量在十分之七，而汽之容量祗在十分之三上下，故鍋爐內汽之壓力，祗須外面火力繼續加增，變水為汽，可儘量提高。鍋爐之爆炸，即其壓力昇高至鋼鐵不能勝任之時而生也。炸彈之所以能炸，即係用炸藥密封在彈內，使着火變氣而膨脹，膨脹至彈壳不能勝任時，即行爆炸。總之，鍋爐，冷氣缸，其他養氣，輕氣，亞莫尼亞等之貯藏瓶，小如汽水或皮油瓶，均有如炸彈一樣之爆炸危險。在十幾年前，作者在吉林時，有一傭人將一聽罐頭牛肉置於火爐上，時久而爆炸。又有天津某姓幼子，以一聽花牌淡乳，投入火爐內而炸傷使女。兩件炸裂原理與鍋爐爆炸無異。為防鍋爐爆炸，每具鍋爐均設有保安汽門，壓力高時，能自行開放，使蒸汽外逸，以免危險。但一般保安汽門多半製造不良，常常無故洩汽，管理之人，因將其設法杜壓，此無異於囚太平門之門閂不良，反而杜塞之，門雖有而等於虛設，危險甚大。此外如在鍋爐上面，或烟囱周圍烘乾布匹物料，不但安全上可虞，亦且有失火之患。至若爐房四壁滿搭鋪格，作工人臥室，則更不宜。其尤甚者則有一襪廠主人，將其新生嬰孩之產婦，休養在一鍋爐房內閣樓之上，雖云可以省去火爐煤炭，即不以鍋爐為可危，而其烟灰之上昇飛揚，與衛生亦有極大妨礙。此種舉動，在有直接關係者，應加禁止。</p>
<p>鍋爐所蒸沸之水汽，其用途有二：一則用其力，即以汽驅動汽機或再變為電，而以之變為種種工作；一則用其熱，除用於冬日取暖之外，他如化學，醫藥，食物，衣服，日用各品之製造，無不用水汽以生熱。處今之世，即在深山茅蓬坐定之老僧，直接或間接無不與汽有密切關係。</p>
<p>蒸汽之用其力者壓力之高低關係甚大，但如用其熱者，蒸汽壓力之大小殊無大進出。不過如因裝置上之簡陋，汽管大小，則壓力低時即不能應用因之不能不提高壓力，以補簡陋管子中之輸送不良。一方面求鍋爐之製價便宜，因之偷工減料，其他一方面則竭力提高壓力，背道而馳為目前上海一般辦廠者之最普徧錯誤。我國人之對於人身，往往因不事運動而腸胃呆鈍，身體瘦弱，惟所視為適當補養辦法者，即滿投滯膩補品，使胃納更為悶閉，其不知原理之反對措置，如同一轍，且成見甚深，甚至死而不悟。其實，為減輕成本計，烟囱內之烟，廢水中之熱，在在均有黃金，祗須有相當辦法，無不可收而復用初不必負莫大危險而求其壓力之高也。</p>
<p>鍋爐之所以能蒸沸蒸汽完全藉所用燃料之熱量。燃料種類甚多，如柴油，煤炭，木料，棉子壳，　糠等等之能燃燒者，無不可以作為鍋爐之燃料。選擇鍋爐之燃料：第一，須求其所含損壞鍋爐之成分，如硫磺等成分不可太多；第二，須求其比例上之價格便宜，蓋鍋爐之大小，以其每小時能蒸沸蒸汽量而定，故所用之燃料須以金錢計算，務求其以最低耗費，蒸飛沸最大量水汽。鍋爐燃料經濟，多半雖在於燃料之適當否，但關於鍋爐本身之構造與其設備者亦不少。上海全市所有鍋爐之中，其因陋就簡者在百分之七十，不但安全可慮，且燃料徒耗，欲求在工業上與人競爭，節省燃料亦當務之急也。</p>
<p>鍋爐蒸沸蒸汽係繼續作用，即水汽用去須加入新水於爐中使之蒸沸，如是則工作不停。因水少而致鍋爐燒壞出險者，亦時有所聞。所用之水，不但須濾去泥沙污濁，且不能多含硬性礦質，江河之水硬性較低，井水泉水則硬度較高，爐水不潔或太硬，易生水箔，此種水箔，不但阻止傳熱，多耗燃料，且損壞鋼鐵，侵蝕鍋爐內部。空氣對於人生為已不可少之物，但爐水中含有空氣，有腐蝕鍋爐之弊。油類酸質更為爐水中所忌之物。爐水之於安全與經濟，關係並不在於燃料之下。</p>
<p>上海一埠在八一三為止，依作者調查，關於工業所用，壓力在於三十磅以上者，其在於特一區界內者，總數約五百具；特二區界內者，約一百具；在閘北與南市浦東及滬西越界路內者，共計又約三百具；總計全市鍋爐，加以調查遺漏——如客棧浴室等——鍋爐一並在內，約計為一千具。據作者推求，民國十年之數約為三百三十只，民國二十年約為六百五十只，十年中增三百二十只，民國二十六年為一千只。其中全數六成以上之鍋爐係本地製造者，對於所用物料，製造方式，適當壓力，與安全裝置，大都未經合格技師之審查，而管理運用更少有學識與經驗並富之人員負其責。　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c138">外滙緊縮後之巿塲 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 遠</p>
<p>自日偽支持之「準備」銀行與「華興」銀行，發行偽鈔，吸收法幣，套取外匯；一方面日貨輸入激增，又來分我外匯，不加防杜，將無底止，平準基金委員會乃採應急之手段，暫時停止外匯供給，如英匯由八辦士二五，縮至六辦士半，美匯所跌亦如之，共影響所及，使所搜括之法幣，不啻貶値百分之二十而强，所欲套之外匯，較前僅得百分之八十弱；反之我準備基金鞏固，反因外匯貴，輸人稀，存金支付之額日减，故曰外匯責，與我戰時經濟有利也。</p>
<p>外匯貴，我出口業工商業獲益非鮮。進口貨成本既增，銷售不易，國貨可暢銷無阻。原料出口，折合外匯甚低，外銷愈利，國際貿易可轉入佳境。必須輸入如化學臀藥機器等，仍由中央銀行以法定匯價供給之，黑市塲匯價昂貴無與也。租界居民，因物價高漲，不無影響生計，然為爭國家生存，求民族解放，雖荊棘遍地，履之如夷也。</p>
<p>因外匯貴而物價漲，不無有其關聯也。然亦有成本未漲者，製造費等未增加也，而外匯之價甫更，物價即以漲價聞，豈廠棧商店之物品，向俱未結外匯耶？是可疑者也。國貨與外匯有不相干者亦趁此機會而漲價有百思而不得其解矣。漲價各物有中西藥，五金業，照相業，絲織業，搪瓷廠，皮革廠，工藝品，然水瓶，汽油，啤酒，罐頭，糖果，自來墨水筆等五十餘種，共餘未見報章而已報漲浙不可勝數。若稍事研究，而知漲價各物應漲者少，無故虛漲者多。如五金業，戰前存貨頗豐，今工廠被燬，需要呆滯，該業增價二三成，直以存貨為外匯矣。日常用品如煤球，為華北白煤屑和黃泥配合製成，前售每噸三十一元許，一旬中三漲北價，今達三十六元矣，除蟲菊製之蚊蟲香，亦無預於外匯也，亦新增一成許，即有關於外匯之各物品。上日匯價甫縮，翌日即加起二三成，是無殊明火執仗之强徒也。</p>
<p>發行偽鈔，求取法幣，復以儻來物，套進外匯，雖匯價縮至五辦士而四辦士，仍取之而不絕也。故應限制外匯供給，淪陷區法幣應减至最低限度，內債本息，應撥付匯劃：票據貼現，應嚴加取締：即銀錢業庫存，亦應减低：杜絕法幣套取外匯之階；一面應由國家銀行切實管理外匯，遇有需要，審查用途其屬於不必需不正當之用途，可取締之。至於利用特殊地位，不受政令拘束，而事吸收存款，買賣生金銀與外匯，實為資金逃避之淵籔，外匯走漏之捷徑，亦應與各方交涉取締之也。</p>

<p>— 慧</p>
<p>這半年來上海的物價，可說是直綫形的向上，造成空前的「百物騰責」現象，給予居住上海的人們莫大的打擊和負擔；雖說是戰時物價的高漲，為必然之結果，但是要特別認識淸楚，上海物價的高漲，有許多是畸形的例外的，不自然的，尤其是六月份裹的各物的暴漲，更不合理。為了黑市塲外滙轉緊，既不是通貨膨脹的刺激，更不是市塲上供求的不相調和，而不論其為洋貨非洋貨，沒有等到進新貨的時候，立時立刻把存貨大漲價，這明明與現在外滙緊縮無關係，顯然是投機操縱，想發國難財，剝奪大衆的生存利益罷了。為了要明白這半年來的漲價實况，除原產品市價，本有早晚不同外，這裏，單就各業在報章上刊登漲價的來統計，共有二百〇三起，除了重行漲價的十一起外，凈計為一百九十二起，也就是一百九十二個漲價的業別和工廠商號的單位，若較去年全年的漲價起數，是增多了四十四起，這表示半年來物價的上漲尖銳化的趨勢。就二百〇三起的漲價在各月份裏比校，那末，要以六月份一百三十八起為最多了，佔漲價說起數十分之六·六强。這因為六月份裏黑市外滙一度收縮後，一般居奇囤積的商人，趁火打刦的明證。次之為三月份十九起，四月份十七起，五月份十四起，二月份十起，殿末為一月份五起。原因在這五閱月裹，外滙黑市是很穩平，少有上落，使得奸商們無所藉口來漲價，當然，土貨更無追隨的餘地了。</p>
<p>再進一步，把漲價的二百〇三起來分析商品種類，是有這樣的十六類，就是飲食·衣着·日用品·醫藥·裝飾·電器·染織·土木·燃料·燭箔·金屬·文化·原料·交通運輸，包裝，淸潔等。若比較商品的種類，首推飲食品二十種為第一位，日用品十六種第二位，裝飾品和金屬品各十二種第三位，文化品，衣着品各十種，第四位，醫藥品和交通運輸各七種第五位，電器和染織品各六種第六位，包裝五種第七位，燃料和原料品各三種第八位，土木品和燭箔品各二種第九位，而以淸潔品一種殿未。這裏，我們可以知道，漲價起數的第一位和第二位，正是人們日常生活的必需，——飲食與食用品無怪一般人們的大聲呼籲生活脅迫呢！茲把漲價的貨物種類和漲價成數，逐一說出於下面：</p>
<p>（一）筵席　每桌起碼十六元。</p>
<p>（二）西菜　中區，午餐每客漲至一元二角，晚餐一元六角五分，西區，晚餐二元。</p>
<p>（三）國產酒　照原價漲一成至一成半。</p>
<p>（四）醬色　照原價每聽漲售半元，為七元二角，復漲五角，售七元七角。</p>
<p>（五）荳腐　荳腐衣每張漲售一、百八十文，荳腐皮每張二十文，每斤六百六十文，荳腐乾每塊三十文，老豆腐每板一千八百文，嫩豆腐每板一千七百文，粗油條每斤九百文，細油條每斤一千文，三角油豆腐每塊二十文。</p>
<p>（六）製茶　照原價每元漲二成半。</p>
<p>（七）鮮桔水　每打漲售五分至一角。</p>
<p>（八）包飯　照原價每客漲一元。</p>
<p>（九）啤酒　先後漲價二次，瓶裝每箱加三元，桶裝每公升加九分。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>小朋友：當你們看報，除掉重要的打仗消息和國際局勢外，你們也看本埠新聞嗎？假使看，那麼總該知道：在不久之前，有一位大學生做乞丐吧。說起來，這件事與你們小朋友又有什麽相干，仔細研究推論起來，就很有點意思。</p>
<p>假使我現在提出一個問題：「那位大學生爲什麽要討飯呢？」你們一定能夠作很滿意的回答說：「他是爲了窮，窮得沒有飯吃，所以被環境逼迫得做乞丐。」這當然不錯。但我又要發問：「那位大學生爲什麽窮得連飯也沒吃？」我想，聰敏些的小朋友一定將回答說：「他是受了打仗的影響，所以窮了。」理由果然對，祗是把他的窮而做乞丐完全推托在打仗頭上，終於還是欠缺的，爲什麽？</p>
<p>都因為那位大學生沒有一樣切切實實的專門本領，否則，就不會老着臉伸手向人家哀求乞錢了。什麽呌「切切實實」的「專門本領」呢？姑且來幾個警喻：像木匠司務會把木板鋸鋸刨刨，釘成一隻桌子，會把許多木料搭成一間房子，這是專門本領。泥水匠會把許多磚塊砌成一堵堅固的牆壁，會澆水門汀，這是專門本領。機器匠會用車床車出一隻齒輪，絲毫不差，會知道機器壞在那裏給予修理，這是專門本領。會裝配無綫電，會做皮鞋，會打字打得快，會排字，……這也都是專門本領。至於「切切實實」者，乃是切於實用之意，也是切實能夠動手做的說法。</p>
<p>小朋友：不是我打謊，好多中學大學畢業出來的學生，這樣也懂些，那樣也懂些，看似「萬能博士」，實則像「豬頭肉，三勿精。」並無一技之長，而所懂的，又都空空洞洞，能說不能做。試問在這生存競爭很激烈的社會上，怎會不失敗！怎會掙到飯吃！以後的社會，只應許有真本領的人吃飯。那麼，親愛的小朋友：你們都是未來的中學生大學生，都是未來社會的一份子，應該得到前車之鑒的經騐，擇自己個性所接近的，學習一樣專門本領，作為將來自立的根本，不受環境的壓迫。雖然你們年紀還小，先要求基本學識，但事先注意，總比臨渴掘井容易些，光陰過的快，轉瞬間你們就要由小學而中學，而大學了。「少小不努力，老大徒傷悲！」小朋友：牢記，牢記。</p>
<h3 id="c153">野蠻身體，文明頭腦 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 潑林山司</p>
<p>用作題目的八個字，就是商務印書館總經理王雲五先生的座右銘；先生常常以此自勵勵人，在好幾年前發表過的一篇演說，也曾將這八個字詳細的解釋過，原來的講詞，因為還記得很清楚，所以決定將它錄下來，和諸位小朋友談談。</p>
<p>先生對於「野蠻身體」的解釋是：有人說我每天工作十四小時，你們也許要懷疑一個老頭子究竟有多少精神，但是事實上，有時或者還要超過十四小時，而多至十五六小時。工作的時候雖然多，可是我從來未曾因工作的繁重而患上了甚麼疾病。照衛生方面來說，好像不近人情，不過我所以不易發生疾病，實在因為我的身體，具有堅強的抵抗力，一方面又因為有興趣的維繫，所以始終沒有感覺到任何苦痛，這正和有好些人通夜打牌而不覺得疲倦的道理一樣。所以我們應該訓練出一個野蠻的體魄來克服一切惡劣的環境。</p>
<p>對於「文明頭腦」的解釋，先生曾經說過「我們不必有文明的享用，却不可不具有文明的想像，」這兩句話。先生又說過，野蠻的身體，假使不輔以文明的頭腦，那麼人類將永遠是野人，文明的頭腦，假使不輔以野蠻的身體，結果祗成為能「坐言」而不能「立行」的文弱書生。</p>
<p>為着篇幅的關係，我不再想補充些甚麼了，因為先生對於這八個字，準確的意義和相互的關係，已經解釋得詳詳盡盡。最後我希望你們諸位小朋友，一齊起來，以足以為我們模範的王雲五先生的座右銘「野蠻身體，文明頭腦，」作為我們立身修己的準則，因為在這蠻不講理的世界上，和國難當頭的時期中，我們有着一付野蠻的身體，再輔以文明的頭腦，就儘足以救亡圖存了。</p>

<p>近代科學的實騐已經證明魚有好記憶力，還能利用經騐來學習，這就是許多釣魚人覺得魚善躲避的理由。</p>
<p>人們釣魚雖然釣了幾百年了，可是他們對於魚究有多少感覺機能，這問題却總沒有一個一致的答案。魚類自然是沒有着充分的審慎心，領悟力及選擇力的，假使魚都是些笨伯，那末，就要勞煩一位聰明人，把它們的智力研究一下。勃朗博士是在伊里諾愛自然歷史研究所工作的，一位博物家，他近來收了一些大嘴黑鯊魚做學生，已經上了一萬四千多次課了。</p>
<p>教授魚類學生，完全不是一樁簡單的工作，它們是學一些顏色的區別，還要練習記憶這些。博士就像一位舊式教師一樣，對於答對的學生，給它們一點獎勵，答得不對的，給一點責罰，他們要學生記憶的顏色，裹在一根小玻璃管上，放在裝魚的水缸裏，當魚游近這種顏色時，就給它一條小小水蛋，或是孑氶吃，教師還誇獎它：「你做得很好，魚啊！」可是錯的顏色，也是這樣放在缸裏，假使一條魚游近這錯的顏色時，他就用一根通有輕弱電流的金屬綫，在它背部一碰，這會給他們輕輕的一個震顫，教師說「魚啊！你弄錯了。」</p>
<p>大嘴的黑鯊們，好像處在一個很活潑的家庭裏一般；因為經過了五次到十次的訓練後，它們大多數能準確的明白分辨出紅的或是黃的，綠的或是藍的顏色來。</p>
<p>以前它們不過是學些顏色區別的初級學生，後來功課愈弄愈難了，裹了深淺顏色的玻璃管放在缸裏，鯊魚要學會辨識玫瑰紅是對的顏色，而罌粟紅就是錯的，這些利用各種顏色的實騐，要達到魚眼辨色感覺的極度而後止，這種功課太難了。</p>
<p>不出一般所料。魚是無論如何像人類一樣有顏色感覺的，勃朗博士說：「魚像有正常顏色視覺的人類一樣，可從一種淡黃色的濾色體看出去，辨識各種顏色，這是有可能性的。」</p>
<p>勃朗博士所發現的當中，最有趣的是魚對那種顏色是對的，那種是錯的，能歷好幾星期甚至一兩月而不忘。已經學習過「紅是對的顏色」的魚，在相當時日後學習「深淺不同的紅色」時，會覺得容易些，勃朗博士自然不指望他的學生永遠記着，那將使魚比人更伶俐了。（譯自Parade）</p>

<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>這幾天，上海的市場上，正鬧着缺乏銅幣的恐慌。這是侵略者搜刮了製造侵略的工具，所造成的現象。現在，代替銅幣即流行在市場上的，是郵票，印花，以及有些公司發行的代幣券。但是沒有銅幣，總感覺着極大的不便。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們知道古代人民沒有錢幣，怎樣做買賣呢？</p>
<p>在極古的時代，人民「日出而作，日入而息」。各人自己的生產，足夠自己的需要，用不到買賣，也就用不到錢幣。到後來，人們的生活漸漸繁雜起來，一個人的生產，不夠一個人的需要，就發生以物易物的交易。諸如你有兩疋布，我有一斗米，我要布，你要米，拿你的布，換我的米，交易就成功了。</p>
<p>但是，這種物和物交換的制度，有許多的不便：如果我要布，你却不要米。那就不能交換了。而且彼此所有的貨物，如果價值不相等的，也就交換不起來了。因此，大家定出一種東西，來做雙方交換的媒介，和價值計算的標準，那就是貨幣。</p>
<p>古時的貨幣，如：貝殼，獸皮，牲畜，羽毛，布帛等等。不過這些東西，也有很多的不便。直到黃帝時候，「范金為刀」，那是金屬貨幣的開駛。</p>
<p>金屬的貨幣，也有好幾種，如：銅幣，銀幣，金幣，鎳幣等。這裏有一幅圖，會告訴你們「我國銅幣的進化」。</p>
<h3 id="c157">畢業的典禮（中） <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 老杜</p>
<p>「他的演說確是挺好的，曾有好幾次對我說得這樣的流利，我就不多把這話全記在心裏。他往往把演說的起端，說得非常的雄偉」，伊更繼續說着，希望引起我的興趣。「人和力造成歷史上種種偉大的奇蹟，我們可以發見這個是由天命中轉變過來的」！</p>
<p>「願上帝賜福這個孩子」！我想一面瞧着伊那快樂而驕傲的臉，真使我不能描寫出心中的驚奇。暗想這樣年幼的孩子嘴裏，怎麼會講出這樣偉大的語句來。</p>
<p>畢業典禮秩序單上的節目正在進行着，也是漸漸地逼近伊那集中全力去注意的一個，這倒使伊心中十分的不安，伊眼睛張得大而發光，面頰上深深地浮起了兩朵紅雲。</p>
<p>「現在輪到他了。」伊帶着又驕傲，又快樂，又不安的聲調對我說。前奏曲開始奏演了，他的名字高聲的喚着，伊是切望得十二萬分，當他踏上台去的光景伊點起了脚跟向前伸過脚去，這時伊似乎已忘記了我。我知道伊的呼吸是很緊張，心好像要從喉間跳出來一般的急。那裏知道伊哥哥走上演講台，面向着聽眾，他的身體也在發抖兩手無力的垂着，臉色變得灰白，嘴唇發青，我也覺得有些忐忑不安。伊便知道這件事對於伊哥哥是不利了，臉上頓時現出恐懼的色彩。</p>
<p>他向聽眾鞠了一個不自然的躬，滿臉呈出糊裏糊塗的狀態，精神不振的向等候的聽眾看着，正像從睡夢中驚醒後的昏迷。他仍像啞子般立着，我瞧上去他恐怕是上場慌了。</p>
<p>呀！他的小妹妹！伊把驚恐的眼光射在我臉上。「他忘記了，」伊說，於是伊臉上透出一種敏捷的變化，更用力地堅決的的向台上一瞧。有一個柔和而勇敢的孩子聲，打破了大廳裏死寂的空氣。</p>
<p>人和力造成歷史上種種偉大的奇蹟，我們可以發見這個是由天命中轉變過來的——每一個聽眾停止了呼吸，專心的聽着——孩子的聲音，孩子的臉龐，而大人的詞句，都覺得非常的驚奇。但是這幾句話的補救已太遲了。垂頭喪氣的哥哥蹣跚地很羞恥的走下台來。接着音樂又演奏了可愛的音浪驅散了人們的失望。</p>
<p>我很同情的對他妹妹瞧了一眼，但伊沒有瞧見我。伊眼中充滿了眼淚，我拍拍伊，想安慰伊一番，可是伊專注着伊的石哥哥。後來我見伊走去攙伊怕羞而年輕的哥哥，他的臉呆板得像的臉一般。</p>

<p>— 小檀</p>
<p>一隻經歷過多次旅行的燕子，見識很廣，經騐很豐富：他能夠預知風雨或災禍的降臨。有一天，他來到一個地方，那裏正在播種苧蔴；看見一個農夫把種仔撒在田溝裏。</p>
<p>燕子向小鳥說：「這個我看了不快活，我正為你們擔憂。倘若我做了你們，就不敢在這種極危險的地方住下去。你們可曾看見那隻手在做什麽？不久，他所撒佈的，會破壞你們的存在。在這裏將張佈許多陷阱或網　，那許多東西要把你們捉住了，關在籠中或投入鍋內，到那時，你們縱使不死，也得做囚犯。就爲了這個，我勸你們快把種仔吃掉，並須相信我的預言才對。」</p>
<p>小鳥們以嘲笑回報他。因在這時，田野裏有許多好吃的東西，他們不必費心去搜檢那些細小的麻種。</p>
<p>待麻田抽綠，燕子又向他們說「將那可咒詛的種仔所生的苗，一棵棵地拔掉罷。要不然，你們一定會喪失的。」</p>
<p>「禍患的預言家，饒舌的王八蛋！」小鳥們說：「你要我們做的真是好差使！我們需有一千人，才能拔盡這整個地方的麻苗呢。」</p>
<p>過了幾時，苧麻長大了。燕子再來規勸：「這不是好兆，可惡的無賴漢就要來了，可是直到如今還沒有人相信我！你們將見到，當小麥已熟，人們不再操作時，他們就要來攻擊小鳥了。那時，到處張着網　來捕捉你們。我勸你們勿再到處亂飛，安分地在窠裏或換個地方罷。可是你們的身體，不像我能夠跋涉荒野，渡過江海。所以你們唯一的安全辦法，只有關在牆洞壁孔中的窠裏不出來。」</p>
<p>燕子的話，小鳥們聽得討厭了。他們不去理睬他，只顧雜亂地啁啾着，飛來飛去在麻田裏玩耍。因此，他們都被網　捕住，再也不會有自由了。</p>
<h3 id="c159">畜生道中（七） <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>彭其打定主意，向着河邊走去，一面不知怎的，却先走到大柳樹下去看看，也許那尸體早已放在那邊了吧！但是低頭一看，却不見有什麽狗尸，只有一頭小貓。一隻不完全的舊籃和一根毛巾的捲筒。彭其抬起頭來看那下垂的柳絲時，却見一輪明月，正從樹枝裏照將下來，似乎分外的大，分外的近，心想要是坐到樹枝上去時，只要伸一伸手，就可抓住那月兒了。</p>
<p>當下他就想到他母親的一本書，現在已在他那兩位妹妹手中，那書很為有趣，據說狗的生命，在人世間一結束之後，就會到月中去。書的飛頁上還有一張畫，就畫着許多狗坐在月中，正在彼此講述它們以前種種的經歷。</p>
<p>彭其心口自語道：「要是昨夜我們所殺死的那頭狗，此刻也已到了月中去，那才奇怪哩。」</p>
<p>他這樣說着，兩眼仍是望着月，彷彿見那月中的人正在向他霎着眼睛。</p>
<p>彭其放聲說道：「那書中所說的，可是真實的麼？」</p>
<p>月中人答道：「雖不全真，却也有些相像。這裏是畜生道，你可要上來玩玩麼？」</p>
<p>彭其忙道：「咦，我從來沒有來過啊！」那月中人很殷勤的說道：「那麼，你不妨來一次啊？但你也許不會得爬上來吧」</p>
<p>彭其不服氣，大聲說道：「你看，我不會得爬麼？」他一面說，一面爬上樹去，三分鐘中，已到了高枝上，和月兒很接近了。他越是爬得高，那月兒也越是見得大，末後竟好似神燈照射出來的一個圓明，大大的照滿了天空。到得彭其爬到坡高的所在，一切都不見了，只見千萬道的白光，團團的圍住了他。</p>
<p>他聽得那月中人放聲說道：「你放大了膽走進來好了，伸出你的脚來，不用害怕；裏面是並不怎樣明亮的。」於是彭其伸出了脚，向下一跳，他心中還以為是跌倒了河中去哩。但他把兩隻脚頓一頓時，却覺得脚下很着實，原來他已到了畜生道中了。這地方當真是一個很奇怪而不可思議的所在！</p>
<p>在那畜生道的入口，坐着一頭狗，分明是看守在那裏的樣子。在這黑狗的背上，坐着一頭烏鴉，它的羽毛雖已被人撏脫了一些，可是烏黑髮亮，還是好好的。在那後面的一片田間，有一頭愛爾蘭的野牛，是一頭瘋的野牛，但也並不傷害別人。另有一頭年老的母牛，在那裏徘徊，可是因為太老之故，再也不能工作了。它們的近邊，又有一頭牝馬在吃草，它的窠是在田的一角，窠中却有一頭知更雀坐着，似乎在那裏想甚麼心事似的。</p>
<p>一頭山雀，正在這窠的近旁飛着，這小小的鳥却會講故事和傳達新聞的，它從來不肯休息，自己也並沒有窠，可是浮言浮語，，也往往沒有根據，並且會弄出是非來的。一隻貓的搖籃在天空中搖晃着，裏面躺着一頭貓，它是會洗碟子，所以頭的下面紮着一塊乾淨的洗碟布，它等到太陽一出，立刻就要去工作哩。此外又瞧見那蜜蜂正在上上下下的飛，像是很忙的樣子，也不知道它忙些甚麼？</p>

<h3 id="c160">銀聯會國貨義賣 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 惜衣</p>
<p>今日起在勸工銀行　三樓舉行會期共八天預定籌足五千元　全數撥作難胞夏令衛生經費</p>
<p>擁有廿千會員的上海銀錢葉聯誼會，會員都是上海銀錢業熱心青年，在這一個月團結之下，領導着全市銀錢業青年作種種有益身心的活動。比如他們的話劇組就曾經公演過好多次，最近為了參與義賣公演，他們又請夏霞擔任導演「緩期還債」，現在正在趕拼中。</p>
<p>今天上午九時起，他們就在會所－南京路勸工銀行三樓（近河南路）舉行一個稍具規模的義賣展覽。</p>
<p>這個義賣展覽會的主席團，都是上海各大銀行的董事及經理，他們的名單如下：徐寄廎，林康侯，潘紀言，許賓騿，周德信，潘仰蕘。</p>
<p>並且更請定新華銀行副經理孫瑞璜夫人黃國秀女士行剪綵禮。</p>
<h3 id="c161">難胞衛生經費 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>昨天我到他們會所參觀的時候，書畫的部份正在佈置，別個部份，似乎還沒有動手。和我談話的兩位先生，一位是方祖蔭，一位是馮樹錦，他們一個是銀錢業同人福利委員會的副主席，一個是合作事業委員會的副主席，這次義賣展覽就是由兩個委員會所主持的。</p>
<p>據方先生說：這個會本來是應上海難民救濟協會衛生組的請求才舉辦的，所籌得的經費，預備全數撥作難胞夏令衛生經費。而且現在各界都在熱心的舉辦義賣運動，銀錢業當然應該站出來為這一個運動多盡一點心力。</p>
<p>所以在五月初接受這個要求以後，就在兩個委員會的合作之下，負責進行一切了。</p>
<p>預定籌五千元</p>
<p>這次進行自然是很順利的，許多廠家都答應參加這次義賣，但大多數都是提成捐難的，不過在價格方面，他們極力使貨色比外面比外面便宜一點，這樣才可以使主顧們有真正的實惠。</p>
<p>他們預定這次義賣總數是五千元，事先他們特地印成一元及兩角的代價券五千元，由會員出去推銷。</p>
<p>二千元的一元券是交給各行號負責推銷的，三千元的二角券是由會員自己出去推銷的。昨天截止，五千元的代價券已經銷去三千元，還有二千元沒有邀進去，不過，依他們想，這五千元的數目，大致上是沒有什麽問題的。</p>
<p>會場共分五組</p>
<p>義賣會場裏，共分五組，由這五組分別向各廠商挼治，這五組是：</p>
<p>（一）醫藥衛生品組-這一組東西最多，參加的藥房工廠較大的有中西大藥房，中國化學工業社，現代化學工業社及其他很多廠家。</p>
<p>（二）實用品組-計有康元制罐廠，上海難民習藝所，許四領帶廠等。</p>
<p>（三）食品組-有太康糖菓公司及采芝齋等。</p>
<p>（四）編織組-有景綸衫織廠，新生女子工藝社等的出品。</p>
<p>（五）當戲組-最近因中央儲蓄會開過一次書畫展覽會，這次義賣作品大多都是由那邊移過來的，計有鄒夢禪，沈子丞，謝師約，袁松年，潘蘅夫諸先生及顧青瑤，徐綺琴，朱玉楞諸女士的出品。</p>
<p>提成捐助居多</p>
<p>從方馮二位先生的談話中間，我個人感覺到任何一次義賣完全捐助的實在太少了如這次。廠商方而祗有科學化工社的寒暑表及愛華製藥廠的藥品(約價四五十元)以外，共餘的廠家都是提成捐助的。</p>
<p>爲了難胞的夏令衛生經費，各大銀行家，各大廠商，是都應該盡一點力，捐出一筆更大的數目來的。</p>
<p>會期前後八天</p>
<p>這次義賣的會期是八天，二日至九日，爲了難胞，太太，小姐，先生，善士，不妨到勸工銀行三樓義賣會場去買點東西，這比到虹廟燒香上燈油的好事，要好上千萬倍了。</p>

<p>第十三回　勸學務農儲材為國　留強汰弱選種有場</p>
<p>何國玉沉吟了一下子說道：「那末我們將來的廠，不知有礙於村民沒有？」朱村長笑道：「大概是沒有什麽妨礙的。不過到那時候，我們也要開一個會議，或且與你們廠們裏約法三章。這也是一種互助之法，大家有益的。現在中國括與各種工廠，都是優待工人，與戰前大不相同。有許多都設了袖習學校，附屬於廠中的，大半夜枝居多。因為中國的工人，從前失學者多，現在覺得很不夠了。由廠中設了袖習學校，讓他們去袖習。要是女工們多的，他們還附設了托兒所，以便利許多有孩子的女工。將來你們的織綢廠，將來開起來，袖習學校在他國是不必，在我們現在的中國，因為從前太缺乏了，此刻就不能沒有了。」朱同長說道：「復興的中國，最緊要的兩件事：一是生產；一是教育。有人和我談到中國的前途，我只說：生產！生產！再加以生產！教育！教育！再施以教育！這兩件事，好像兩個車輪，推動中國進行，缺一個就不能進行。你們兩位小姐說，這話對不對？」何家兩位小姐，頗佩服這位老公公的話兒，他們那時離了運河邊，沿着一條公路，緩緩而行。卻見那邊正在建築一所房子，朱村長便指點她們瞧道：「這便是那個紙廠，一月以後，房子便可以落成了。」何變玉忽然問道：「那個製種場，不就在近傍嗎？」朱村長道：「離此也不遠，你們要去看看嗎？在養蠶的時候，比較忙一點，現在卻甚空闊，沒有什麽客觀的。回國以後，在她們家鄉廣東，倒也是養蠶的。但沒有江浙之盛，而且她們居住在都市之內，養尊處優，也沒有見過養蠶。現在中國的蠶事，除江浙而外，已經普及於別個省份了。戰後最盛行的，要算四川，雲南的幾省。最初的蠶種，從江浙兩省傳過去的，所以雖然不是養蠶時候，她們也想去看看。（一五〇）</p>

<p>老朋友中間，用鳥名來做名號的很多，鶴啊鳳啊鶼啊，不一而足；像我這麼一頭瘦瘦的鵑，也居然來湊上一腳，添續末座。要是問起這班鳥兄鳥弟的年紀來，還得推雲鶴獨鶴兩位做老大哥。雲鶴（舊號病鶴）是畫師前輩，人物山水繡毛花卉，樣樣來得，十多年前，曾在本報自山談擔任時賓諷刺畫三年之久，作風是新舊折衷的。獨鶴是報人前輩，因為前清睹曾應過童子試，自幼兒就練得一手好字。二鶴都有口才，都善說笑話，座有二鶴，頓時覺得熱鬧不少；素以他們倆合作起。開頑笑來，真能使人冠纓索絕，笑痛肚皮的。入夏以來，二鶴并不合作起扇面來，雲鶴畫，獨鶴字，各有千秋。你只要出五塊錢，向新聞報館去定一把鶴扇，往後拿在手裡，就好似拿着鶴的翅膀，臨風一搖，自然習習生風，遍體涼快哩。</p>
<h3 id="c165">暑期學校 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 公懷</p>
<p>我顧主辦暑期學校的先生們，能熱心地培育這些求知心切的學生們，更肩負每一個家長殷切的期望！</p>
<p>寒暑表上的水銀柱，已是經常地爬過九十度，七月初的天氣，熱浪早開始在還人口擁塞的都車裏翻滾着。無論大·中·小學，這時都已開始放暑假，使莘莘學子，在此　　的炎夏，可以恢復一下終年攻讀的勞倦。但另一面，實在這假期太長了，一般的家長，都深恐子女們的學業，會因太長的假期而荒廢，所以都想在早上或晚上，使他們把主要的功課補習一下，還有對某科功課特別低劣的學生，也都想利用這長期的暑假，請人補習，以資補救。於是，在這種環境需要的條件下，各式各樣的暑期學校，便應運而生。</p>
<p>這些暑期學校，以性質來分，可以得到下列四種：</p>
<p>第一種是屬於「夏令兒童健康營」之類的暑期學校。他們的特點是使兒童在炎炎的夏日，有一個環境優美設備完善的地方，在教師，護士，醫師，保姆的共同護育下，發展和增進兒童的智德體　四育。所以他們招收的兒童，大多限定四歲以上十五歲以下。但因收費的較昂，非一般家長負擔得起，祗有上中階級的人家，才有這種能力；否則，誰不願把子女送到一個較好的，充滿着教育意味的環境中去呢？</p>
<p>第二種是中小學裏附設的暑期學校，擔任的教師，當然也是原校的多。這種暑校的所以發達，有三方面的意義：在學生方面，出了低康的代價，可以受到一個月的教育，在家庭經濟不足以請家庭教師的人家，當然很需要的，並且，假使有一二科不及格，將遭「留級」的命運，現在到校補習後，成績較好的話，就可免去這個舛運。（因各校類多存此變通辦法）在教師方面，上海的學校，多數薪金一學期以五月計算。在長長的暑期內，收入毫無，而支出卻無法停止，況且下米珠薪扛，生活更是不易，假使沒有　「外快」來挹注，倒也很夠困難的。要在暑期內謀他業，又勢有不能，暑期學校遂成為大家的最理想副業了。在學校呢，因開辦暑校，既可拉住原有學生，又可吸收校外新生，對於學校方面，當然大有裨益的。</p>
<p>第三種是原有的補習學校，他們為適應時令起見，也大多加設「暑期班」，以廣收新生，增加收入。他們的補習課目，從英·德·法·日文等外國語起，一直到會計·廣告·工程·打字等專門技術止，幾乎包羅萬象，無一不備。至於程度，則由小學三·四年級起一直可到大學三·四年級止，其範圍之廣泛，絕非一般暑校所可望其背項。所以此種暑校的學生，都非常擁擠。</p>
<p>第四種是臨時開設的暑期學校，教師是在校肄業的大中學生，他們利用暑期，集合同學數人，向母校商借校舍，或自行去臨時租借，一方果可藉此收入，邀付下學期的學費。一方也可得些教學經驗，但數量方面，是很少的。</p>
<p>現在，正是各暑校的招生時期，一轉瞬，他們又要開學了，我願主辦學校的先生們，能熱心地培育這些求知心切的學子們，更田負每一個家長殷切的期望呀！</p>

<p>— 顧蘭君</p>
<p>寫一從業的經歷與感想</p>
<p>二演「十三妹」留下大話柄關於驚險塲面的表演，有些是可以運用攝影技巧來瞞觀衆的；但遇事實上下容假借的地方，却就非得冒險從事當眞表演不。譬如一個該從地上躍地上躍登屋面的鐘頭，只須用着倒拍方法，由那演員從屋面上躍下地來，將來映到銀幕上時，便可成為一躍而上的驚奇畫面；這樣是比較容易得多了。可是，偈我們女孩兒家，不用說絕對跳不上去，便是要從上面跳下來的話，亦不免於提心吊膽，感到十二分的害怕。</p>
<p>前次，在拍演「兒女英雄傳」十三妹大破能仁寺的時候，就有這麼一塲危難表演。要使片子演得精彩，兼為忠於本職設想，我這十三妹也就只能咬定牙根，放大膽子來試上一試了。不料站定在屋頂上，猛的踏前一步，正等向下躍去時，這座趕工搭造的房子，上面的泥土選是相當潮濫而沒有有牢固。因此足失觸處，直瀉而下，整個身體便出仰翻在高屋上而硬生生地跌下了地而；上下間的離，說高不高，至少也在丈半以外，這當兒係由臂部着地，痛得十分厲害。自已的魂兒早就嚇得飛上半天，迷迷糊的只覺胸口緊緊悶住了，一些兒都沒法透過氣來。許多同塲工作人自導演先生以下，幕地見到我這般跌暈了的情形，頓時都為慌張失措，著急不堞。好得有位先生倒是個內家，當下忙將我的兩腿灣起了，儘向我胸前猛力地撳貼。據說這是打策這胸一股鬰氣的急救法了。果然，沒多時，一靈長漢，隨着吐出了一日間氣，就此悠悠然地神志清郎，配了過來。</p>
<p>事後，我覺傷勢幸喜不重，只　了一些藥膏，並沒有去問醫求治。導演先生看到我這樣子，他說這幕戲還可敷衍，你可不必重后拍了。後來就將跌下屋面的上半截片子剪用完事。而銀幕上所映現出來的，亦即是示及着地的這幕意外「表演」了。為了用作永恒的紀念，特地把一節廢棄的片子保存了。同時，這番苦難在我腦海中鐫下了一個可怖的印象，直到現在為止，還沒有法子來使它消逝。</p>
<p>此外，這件不幸的事端，又給許多伙伴們留下一個可笑的話柄：「蘭君，狗皮膏要哦」「顧小姐，狗皮膏要唯　！」每天跑上攝影塲去，總有幾位朋友這樣向我打趣，不但旁人聽了哈哈大笑，便是連我自己，亦常為之忍俊不禁！</p>

<p>— 李菱叔</p>
<p>——梅邊雜憶之四——　（四）</p>
<p>我們自大莫斯科公演以來，時時刻刻注意到台下觀衆中，有沒有一個濃眉毛大鬍子（史太林）其人？但是始終未被發現。英國的靑年漂亮外交家艾登（那時任掌　大臣，適游俄京）以及英國的布景專家七弋登克雷氏，還有李維諾夫氏，都曾經光顧過。獨有蘇聯政府幾位要人，我們總猜不透「到底來看過我們的中國戲沒有」？</p>
<p>有這樣一個最後的機會，我們全體團員，非常的興奮！總以為可以瞻仰蘇聯要人如史太林，莫洛托夫……的　采。我想這也是一種崇拜英雄的心理，是每個人都有的。</p>
<p>幕啟了！在國家劇院最後的公演開始了！中蘇的旗　，分懸在舞台前兩旁。我們在台上表演的時條，一部份的心靈，注意到台下觀衆「一有沒有一個濃眉毛大　子其人」？祇看見有兩個　　，閒峯　，並未坐人，似乎在等待幾位責實的降臨。</p>
<p>不數分鐘，那包　中的燈光，突然黑暗了！而我們舞台面的反身光線，也特別比平進來得强烈！我閃　看看台下，歷為燈光的强弱關係，慕然間好像放下了一層黑幕，什麼也看不見了！　望望那兩個包廂中，隠隠約約多了同個黑影而已！在這時，後台中急添子幾位不相識的次漫，兩手揮在及袋中，總徽的　者！我想你一定知道他是　？</p>
<p>劇　之後，才有一位後台職員告訴我們說：「史太林剛才來看過戲了」。但是我們並未親見其人，不敢確定說「史太林一定看過我們的戲」。所以我們（梅戲團團員），從蘇聯獻演回國直到今天，在腦海裏還遺留着　這樣的一個擬問：「史太林看過我們的中國戲嗎」？（完）</p>

<p>侯玉蘭之「玉堂春」</p>
<p>玉蘭工青衣，宗程派，在平有「女硯秋」之雅號，昨日首次登毫，捧者甚多，幕內「苦呀」一聲，高亢而有頓音，獲得滿堂彩。出塲搖板「來至在」三字運低間，平平唸出，與硯秋不同，「往上觀」之「上」字，「刀斧手」之「斧」字，「心又寒」之「又」字，皆在程味，且發音有顫抖聲浪，又為酷似。旁余坐者，指為怯塲所致，其實此正係程腔之特點。蓋蘇三初進察院，心　俱裂，發音應有悲　之聲，倒板「玉堂春跪至在都察院」句，高唱入雲，能同潤而弗裂，殊佳。「大人哪」迴龍，行　別　，慢枚句句在彩，而尤以「十六歲開懷是那王公子」句為　佳，後　原板平平，惟「在周倉是下敘一敘舊情」句，「敘一敘拔高，」「舊情」二字，同時唱出，低若　絲，跌宕秀逸，此種新腔頗極音調之美，可取。二六無　句，流水「七孔流血命歸陰」句，　揚得宜，「拉拉扯扯到公庭」句，「拉拉」二字高拔，「扯扯二字低　，低徊袁婉，悽愴欲約，與」「敘舊情情」句，有異曲同工之妙，此種悅耳音調之創造，是程腔之勝人處，畹華不及也。惟「王公子一家多和順，奴與他露水夫妻有什麼的情」句，「奴與他」詞不達意。似有語病。玉　已將「奴與他改為一他與奴」，一字之易，文詞大異，玉蘭旣宗程，例應效法為宜。後段二六學程未窺堂奧，「這一塲官司未　堂奧」，「這一塲官司未動刑」句，「未」字與「刑」字，發音高低，未能諧和，扮相清秀委婉，雅淡有餘，富麗不是，以表做風格論，實為正上青衣才質，臉上戲情，未臻完美內心表演，尙等進取，戲路以悲劇為宜，嗓音圓潤甜脆都有，能　重唱，昨日跪唱三刻鐘，從未飲塲，且無力竭聲啊之態，天賦勝人，佳　也。玉堂春　畢，休息十分鐘，</p>
<p>言菊朋之「空城計」</p>
<p>登塲，菊朋學譚，曾下苦功，於「字」腔「韻」三端，極有硏究。「空城計」為老譚傑作，無深世工夫，難得神體，該劇之北明，須確穆肅靜，三報之神情，固需各異，而鎭靜工去不可少，故無　氣者不能演，無名貴氣者亦不能演；火氣不可太露，瘟解亦非所宜；菊朋以知天命之年，演此劇恰合身分。上塲引子，抑揚頓挫，極有分寸，「四輪卓」之「車」字「兩代賢臣」之「臣」字，發音正確，迸口而出，重若千鈞，「快似風雲」句，亦妙。搖　「免老夫親自裏去把賊收」之「賊」字，有力，「我用兵數十年……」一段，字字珠璣，句句精彩，「老軍們因何故紛紛議論，」「國家事用不着爾等勞心」，「這西城原本是……」三段，種情鎭靜，態度安開，將孔明當時情景，曲曲　出，而尤以第二塲出塲今「兵出祁出地……」为最可人，笑容滿而。　態安詳，常伶演來，往往以愁眉苦臉出之，實覺無理。蓋第二塲上塲，未見地圖，未傳敗訊，滿冀馬　，引兵退，勝利歸來，其所念對句　，亦自翊用兵得當，勝利可操，而絕未有　氣也。樓上，慢板，一先帝爺下南陽御駕三請」句，佳，餘平平，二六無警句。「來來來……」句，以手招司馬懿，似嫌火，總之城樓一節，最難唱，菊朋神態灑脫自若，聆後俗塵頓消，此種工夫，有關火候，火候旣到，自能流露於不知不覺間，而終不可以力求也。菊朋以舟車頓勞，　　似未能十分痛快，後塲「怒在心頭難消恨」之倒板，及「火膽」等拔高處，未能運用自如，據云昨日偶嬰小　，抱病登臺，宜共有此景象，斬謖後之悔恨交併，頓是慨漢，不　不火，精神極好。馬連昆之馬謖，白口沈着白口沈着有力，表做亦細　周到，　盛戎之司馬懿，嗓意渾成可喜，未來之銅　美才，以是左輔右　，　收牡丹級葉之效也。</p>

<p>Japanese troops in Yingde, Huaxian, and southeastern Zhongluotan have suffered heavy casualties due to continuous attacks by the Chinese army.

The Chinese army in Zhongtiao Mountain has now fully demonstrated its mobile tactics. (Thirtieth-day dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) A week ago, the Japanese army invaded Zhongtiao Mountain eight times, and the situation was extremely tense. A certain commander personally crossed the river to supervise the battle at the front line. Using swift and mobile strategies, they captured Yuanqu, killing or wounding five to six thousand Japanese soldiers, creating another glorious victory. The commander returned to a certain place on the evening of the 29th, passing through here, where more than two thousand people from all walks of life came to the station to welcome him. According to him, the victory in Zhongtiao Mountain was due to the dedication of the officers and soldiers, especially the assistance of the people. The invading Japanese troops numbered fifteen to sixteen thousand. The Chinese army had voluntarily abandoned several strongholds, waiting for them to fall into the encirclement before launching a full-scale encirclement, defeating them in one fell swoop. It is also reported that the morale of the Japanese army has declined, and a general collapse is expected soon. Shanxi, the last barrier of North China, will surely be further consolidated.

<p>(Tokyo) Kato, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in "Manchukuo," and Tanaka, the Japanese consul in Tianjin, will arrive in Tokyo on Sunday morning to participate in discussions on the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin issue. Herbert, the British consul in Tianjin, who came to Japan on a British destroyer, will arrive in Yokohama on Sunday afternoon. According to Asahi Shimbun, representatives of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin are arriving here one after another. The newspaper expects that the meeting between British and Japanese representatives on the Tianjin situation will begin with a speech by Foreign Minister Arita, and British Ambassador Craigie will present the general situation of the Tianjin issue. Then, the representatives of both sides will hold a roundtable discussion on specific points. Representing Japan will be Arita, Kato, Tanaka, representatives of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, and several observers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Representing Britain will be Craigie, Herbert, and several members of the embassy. (One-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain Japanese military spokesman here, the British side now hopes that Tokyo's attitude may be more moderate than that of the Japanese army in North China, but the Japanese army in North China has decided to ask Tokyo to support its position. He also said that although the anti-British movement has nothing to do with the Japanese army, all actions in North China are related to the Japanese military. (One-day Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the rumor that the British Concession Authority is about to transfer 500,000 silver dollars in the existing Bank of China to the Japanese side, the Japanese consul in Tianjin, Tashiro, inquired with the British and French consuls, and the British and French consuls both stated that the rumor was groundless. It is reported that the silver is currently being kept by foreign banks in the concession, and the Japanese side is still closely monitoring it. (One-day Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers remain pessimistic about the upcoming Anglo-Japanese conference to discuss the Tianjin situation. It is said that the success or failure of the Tokyo talks will depend on whether Britain is willing to reconsider its "pro-Chiang" policy. Asahi Shimbun believes that what Britain is doing is "disrupting and disturbing the peace and order of Tianjin." The newspaper also infers that if Britain agrees to cooperate with Japan to maintain the peace and order of Tianjin and promote the economic happiness of China, then Britain can share a portion of Japan's responsibilities in the occupied areas. Hochi Shimbun claims that Japanese representatives must adhere to the policies agreed upon by the government and the Japanese authorities in Tianjin. Any slight concession would be a major obstacle to the sacred work of revitalizing East Asia. Yomiuri Shimbun claims that Japan will consistently demand cooperation from Britain in future military, economic, and political construction work during the conference. (- Day Reuters dispatch) .</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, a Japanese military spokesman here confirmed to reporters the news that British merchant barges were detained by the Japanese authorities at Xinhe, 30 miles downstream from Tianjin. It is said that the barges were being towed by tugboats on Thursday and passed through Xinhe. Japanese sentries ordered them to stop, but they ignored the order. The sentries then fired warning shots, and the tugboats towing the barges stopped, leaving the barges at Xinhe. No one has claimed them yet. The Japanese authorities will first inspect the export goods loaded on one of the barges and then decide what to do. It is reported that the barges are owned by Dagu Tugboat Company and Taikoo Dockyard and Engineering Company, which are currently trying to secure their release. (One-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the detention of the barges of the Taikoo Dockyard and Engineering Company and the warning shots fired by Japanese sentries, an investigation will be conducted after the British warship HMS Lowestoft arrives here tomorrow morning. However, the detained barges have now been released. It is reported that when the Japanese sentries fired warning shots, they grazed the shoulder of a certain White Russian employee on board. (One-day Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Tianjin incident, the Anglo-Japanese negotiations are about to begin in Tokyo. Informed sources here say that the negotiations will be protracted, and their outcome is closely related to the development of the European situation. Generally, what the two sides will discuss is not the issue of Britain's China policy, but Japan's position in the event of a future world war. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax gave a speech yesterday, emphasizing the importance of the European situation and believing that the Far East issue is a consequence of the European issue. This view is indeed insightful. Accordingly, since Britain has adopted a tough stance towards Germany, it is more effective to resolve the Tianjin incident than to send warships to China. As far as Japan is concerned, if it resolves its differences with Britain, it can avoid being drawn into the vortex of a future war. Whether it is beneficial for Japan to participate in the war should be considered. In short, the country should quietly await the progress of the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the development of the Free City of Danzig issue, and the amendment of the US Neutrality Act, and its attitude will shift depending on these three factors.

<p>Fancheng: The Chinese Anhui-Hubei guerrillas have recently launched attacks on the Japanese army and have gained considerable achievements. The Japanese troops in Anqing Damingtou have been using firepower to provide cover and building trenches, but they have been destroyed by the Chinese. More than 300 Japanese troops consisting of infantry, cavalry, and artillery jointly attacked Dianpu and Liangyuan in the northeast on the 27th but were repelled by the Chinese army, which killed more than 40 Japanese soldiers. More than 100 Japanese troops who attacked Zhaogao, north of Chaoxian County, have been routed. Sixian Xu Da Zhuang was once captured by the Japanese on the 26th, but was recaptured by the Chinese army after a counterattack on the 30th, and the Japanese suffered heavy losses. A unit of Japanese troops in Xinyang attacked Luoshan on the 27th but were ambushed by the Chinese army at Langanpu Yao, and the Japanese troops retreated along the original route. More than 200 Japanese troops in Macheng were conducting exercises in Wu Bo Mountain on the 28th when the Chinese army launched a surprise attack, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers.

<p>Fancheng: Except for Yingcheng, where more than 200 Japanese troops have contacted the Chinese army in Gujingjie, south of Dongqiao, which has been diverted from Jingshan, and there are still guerrilla wars in the Qianjiang area, the situation in other parts of central Hubei is in a stalemate.

<h3 id="e8">The So-Called New Japanese Military Strategy <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>According to a recent Hong Kong dispatch, Japan has a so-called new strategy for the war in China, namely "main offensive against Shaanxi, supporting offensive against central Hubei, feigned offensive against Hunan and Jiangxi, naval guerrilla offensive against South China, continued suppression and mopping up of guerrillas in southern Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and central China, and it is rumored that they have set a deadline to occupy eastern Zhejiang by early July." In theory, a so-called strategy is not a publicly declared plan. It is often judged or speculated by the other party or a third party based on intelligence or observation of the development trend of the war situation. Therefore, whether the Japanese side has a so-called new strategy, and whether the content of the new strategy is indeed as described, cannot yet be fully determined. However, since the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou and Wuhan, more than eight months have passed, and they have been bogged down in the Central Plains, with troops exhausted. Although they have attempted to advance several times in between, the result has been nothing more than losing troops and generals, unable to advance even an inch. At the same time, their own domestic problems have increased, contradictions have deepened, the economy has been exhausted, and people's minds have been unsettled. On the other hand, China's War of Resistance has entered a new stage, with military strength increasing daily and morale flourishing. International assistance is increasing, and the people's hearts at home are becoming more and more determined. Comparing the two, although it cannot be said that the outcome of the battle has been determined, there is no doubt that China has gradually moved from darkness to light, and Japan has gradually moved from light to darkness. Therefore, in order to save their own decline and cope with the new situation of the war, it is not impossible for the Japanese to revise their strategy. If so, then the Japanese army's new strategy is in fact nothing more than a countermeasure to China's new stage of the War of Resistance. However, this countermeasure has lagged behind and inevitably shows a passive nature. Furthermore, judging from the actual situation of the recent war: Within a few months, the Japanese army has repeatedly attacked Xiangfan, attempting to echo southern Shanxi and covet Shaanxi and Luoyang. However, when the Japanese army in southern Shanxi was unable to cross the river, the Japanese army in northern Hubei retreated knowing it was difficult, and lay dormant. For example, this week, the Japanese army threatened to blockade all of China's seas, but their actions were erratic and unpredictable, sometimes targeting Wenzhou Port and sometimes the Fujian Sea. Moreover, after occupying Yuhuan and Chuanshi Islands, they suddenly and voluntarily withdrew, but the fleet remained dense, and the situation remained tense. From these two examples, it can be seen that the "supporting offensive" and "guerrilla offensive" in the so-called new strategy are not without reason.</p>
<p>Assuming that the Japanese side does indeed have such a new strategy, then apart from the deadline for occupying eastern Zhejiang being clearly a mere boast, we can see the following key points regarding the other items: First, the so-called main offensive and supporting offensive are likely to be aimed at the Northwest. Second, the so-called feigned offensive and guerrilla offensive are nothing more than attempts to contain China's military forces. Third, the so-called suppression and mopping up mean consolidating the occupied areas and removing the threats to their own rear. If we first talk about the second and third points, we can know that the Japanese army holds extremely deep-seated fears about the extension of the front line, the insufficient distribution of their own forces, and the widespread development of Chinese guerrilla warfare. However, the facts have told us that this new strategy of the Japanese army will definitely not have any effect. Because China's military strength has fully grown during the War of Resistance, and there has been significant progress in both quality and quantity. If the Japanese army launches a feigned offensive here and a guerrilla offensive there, how much of China's military force can they contain? However, the Japanese army itself will therefore further increase the difficulty of insufficient distribution, and the result will only be to dig a few more graves and create several opportunities for annihilation. As for the so-called mopping up and suppression of guerrillas, everyone knows that this is a pipe dream. Looking at Shanxi Province, the Japanese army has cleared out guerrillas several times, but after nearly twenty months, the result is that most of the territory, except for the area near Taiyuan and the narrow area along the Tongpu Railway, is still in the hands of the Chinese army. If Shanxi is like this, how can southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu be any different? Moreover, with guerrilla organizations becoming more and more tightly knit and the national consciousness of the people becoming stronger and stronger, the more the guerrillas are suppressed, the more they will inevitably increase. How can one even talk about suppression?</p>
<p>As for the point of targeting the Northwest for attack, it is even more worthy of our examination. Originally, since the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou and Wuhan, they claimed to advance simultaneously on the Northwest and Southwest. However, after repeatedly hitting walls, they turned around and rushed eastward and westward, becoming aimless. Now, in the so-called new strategy, they have again proposed the Northwest as the target of attack, which shows that they have narrowed the scope of their strategy, no longer the grand pronouncements of the past. This is tantamount to admitting half of their failure. Considering the attack on the Northwest, what exactly is the Japanese army's ambition? Based on common sense, the Japanese army's attack on the Northwest has no more than the following three purposes: First, to cut off Sino-Soviet communication and give the Soviet Union a huge threat. However, in order for Japan to achieve this goal, it must penetrate deep into Qin and Long, and even cross the quicksand to attack Xinjiang, in order to have a real effect. But does Japan really have this power? Second, to encircle and outflank Sichuan, giving China's new anti-Japanese base area the most serious threat. This is part of the so-called Itagaki Armistice Line, and it is also a wish that the Japanese army has always had in mind. If the Japanese army really wants to fulfill this wish, it must attack the Northwest and Southwest simultaneously; even if we take a step back and only talk about the Northwest, it must include Hanzhong and sweep Longnan, otherwise it will be difficult to succeed. This is something that the exhausted Japanese army cannot easily achieve. Third, in order to consolidate the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, it is necessary to occupy Guanzhong. On the one hand, it can remove the current threat from the upper reaches to the lower reaches, and on the other hand, it can further use the momentum of a downward-flowing stream to suppress the Central Plains. This was originally the experience indicated by Chinese history. The Qin state used Guanzhong as its base to unify the Central Plains, and Xiang Yu abandoned Guanzhong, which led to the disastrous defeat at Gaixia. The Japanese army is now constantly thinking about the Northwest, taking Shaanxi as the main target of attack, and its most important role may only be to consolidate North China. It is not known.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army began to launch the war two years ago, its initial goal was originally in the so-called North China. Later, because of the progress of the battle on the Yangtze River, it aroused greater greed. Now, the so-called new strategy is focused on consolidating North China, then this new strategy fully exposes the Japanese army's imposing appearance with a weak interior, and it can also be said to have a retreating meaning.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's coveting of the Northwest has no more than the following routes: The northern route is to attack Ningxia from Baotou and attack Lanzhou; the eastern route is to cross the river from Shanxi to attack northern Shaanxi; the southeastern route is to cross the river from southern Shanxi to intercept Shaanxi and Luoyang, and then join the Henan army to launch a frontal offensive along the Longhai Railway; the southern route is to attack Hanzhong from Xiangfan or to take a detour out of Wu Pass. In the past, the Japanese army has tried some of these routes without success, and some have always been afraid to try lightly. Now, they actually want to exert the power of a spent arrow, trying to achieve goals that could not be achieved before. I am afraid that the Japanese army itself would not dare to say that they are confident! Then, the so-called new strategy is simply a strategy that can be predicted to fail.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to sources here, the Japanese consul in Xiamen, Uchida, sent a note to the Gulangyu Consular Corps on Thursday, urging them to resolve the Gulangyu issue as soon as possible. The key points of the note are twofold: strict suppression of the anti-Japanese movement in Gulangyu; cooperation between the police department of the Public Works Bureau and the police personnel of the Japanese Consulate; Regarding the Japanese side's request for the position of Chief Inspector, which has now been withdrawn, it has been replaced by the request that the Deputy Chief Inspector must be a Japanese national and that four Japanese police officers must be added to the Public Works Bureau. However, since the Japanese note was submitted, there has been no response, so it is believed here that British officials are clearly disregarding the local British community's hope for a peaceful resolution of the Concession issue with Japan and are only trying to delay or ignore it. (One-day Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) According to Japanese sources, the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, Uchida, sent an official letter to the Foreign Consular Corps on Thursday, strongly urging a speedy resolution of the Gulangyu issue.

As for the Japanese side's original request to employ ten Taiwanese people as Public Works Bureau police, it is reported that the Japanese side has reserved this request until the next taxpayers' meeting.

<h3 id="e10">A Week's Military Situation in the North and South: Remarks by Military Spokesperson <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Remarks by the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission: Concerning the military situation in the north and south over the past week, the Japanese forces in southern Shanxi have suffered heavy losses. Their eighth attempt to invade Zhongtiao Mountain has been severely thwarted. On other fronts, our forces have also achieved relatively significant victories. However, the Japanese army has successfully landed in various coastal areas but lacks the strength to penetrate deeply. A summary of the events is as follows:</p>
<p>In the Guangdong area, after seizing Toutuo, the Japanese forces advanced along the railway line in three routes towards Chao'an, capturing Meixi and Anbu successively. Through courageous counterattacks, we once regained them successively. However, Caitang was again captured by the Japanese on the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, the Japanese forces launched a fierce attack on Chao'an from the southeast and northwest by land and air. The battles on all fronts were intense, with heavy casualties on both sides. Subsequently, our fortifications were completely destroyed, and we had no choice but to retreat to the highlands outside the city to monitor the Japanese forces. In this battle, the casualties among our main forces were significant, resulting in more losses than gains. Our large army is steadily arriving and will continue to counterattack. As for the four hundred-odd Japanese troops in Xinhui and Jiangmen in western Guangdong, they advanced towards Pingdiling on the morning of the 24th and engaged our forces in a fierce battle for a day and night. By the 25th, the Japanese abandoned over two hundred corpses and fled. There were fierce battles in Xinjie and Shegang in northern Guangdong. Our forces besieged Xinjie on the 23rd and captured Shegang on the 28th, annihilating over three hundred Japanese soldiers and seizing a large amount of war materiel.</p>
<p>In the Zhejiang and Fujian areas, on the morning of the 23rd, over a thousand Japanese troops landed at Yancang and Dongyue Temple on the Zhoushan sea, under cover of artillery fire, and advanced towards Dinghai County. Our defending forces fiercely resisted and engaged in fierce battles. At the same time, a large number of Japanese troops also landed at Shenjiamen. By the evening of the 23rd, due to strategic considerations, we voluntarily abandoned the county seat and held firm on the second line of defense, continuing to fight. By the 26th, five Japanese warships, six motorboats, and over ten civilian ships landed at Kanmen Town and Yacheng in Yuhuan County. After being met with a head-on blow, they retreated to the ships. The next day, they launched another fierce attack. Because the fortifications were completely destroyed, our forces retreated to a certain location. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in Kanmen. As for the outer reaches of the Minjiang River and the sea off Fuqing, many Japanese warships have also gathered in recent days. On the 26th and 27th, they launched attacks on Chuanshi Island and Dongyang Island, which belongs to Pingtan. Chuanshi Island is an unimportant small rocky mountain where our army had not established defenses, so it fell into Japanese hands. Fierce fighting continues on Dongyang Island, and the Japanese have suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>In the Shanxi area, the fighting in northwestern Shanxi has been quiet in recent days. In eastern Shanxi, two to three thousand Japanese troops advanced south along the Baijin Highway and were met and severely defeated by our forces at Nanguan and the Fen Shuiling areas. The Japanese suffered a major setback. They then reinforced with over two thousand troops from Taigu and Qixian and invaded Zouma Ridge, Quindian, and Gucheng. Subsequently, through vigorous counterattacks, all were reported to have been recaptured, and the Japanese fled southwest, currently remaining in a stalemate on the Jiajiazhuang line. In addition, two to three thousand Japanese troops from Wutai have been advancing south in recent days, attempting to open up the Pinding Highway, but they have made no progress after being blocked in the Bailan Town area. As for our forces in southern Shanxi, after abandoning Luoyang and Yuanqu last week, they began to counterattack on the 23rd, luring the Japanese into mountainous areas and launching a fierce attack. The Japanese were unable to respond and collapsed and fled north. As a result, we captured Yuanqu on the 25th and Gaoluo on the 26th. The defeated Japanese fled towards Xiaxian and Wenxi. Taking advantage of the victory, we pursued and successively captured important places such as Majiashan, and have now heavily surrounded the Japanese.</p>
<p>In addition, we recovered Kelimenyingzi in northern Suiyuan, advanced on Zaoqiang in southern Hebei, killing the Japanese regimental commander, Colonel Mitsuhashi. In the battle of Qiebu and Lucun in southern Shandong, over seven hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. In the Anhui area, we defeated the Japanese troops invading north of Anqing, and in eastern Henan, we recovered Wuzi and Lichangying. After a fierce battle, Maqiushi in northern Jiangxi fell into our hands. The Japanese troops in Qianjiang in central Hubei, after being besieged for many days, have fled towards Tianmen, and its recovery is imminent. The Japanese troops entrenched on Junshan in northern Hunan have also fled towards Yueyang, and the area has been recovered for the third time. These are the major victories of the past week, and a special report is attached here. (29th dispatch)</p>

<p>Qingpu Correspondence: Qibao melons are sweet, crisp, and palatable, and are deeply appreciated by the general public. Before the war, before the Little Heat solar term, fruit merchants from nearby counties and Shanghai would go to Qibao Town to purchase them. This year, due to less rainfall and a mild climate, the melons taste even better and the yield is higher than before. The harvest is also slightly earlier than before. The people of Qibao hope that this year's income can slightly compensate for the losses suffered in previous years. A few days ago, farmers harvested a large quantity and planned to transport them to Shanghai via the Puhuitang Canal for sale. Unexpectedly, they were blocked by the local puppet "Maintenance Society," who declared that they must first consult the Qingpu puppet county government before they could be released. Yesterday, they received a reply from the puppet county government stating that a tax of five yuan must be paid per dan. Farmers are unable to transport the melons to the market due to the high taxes, which have doubled the cost.</p>

<p>(London) A British government spokesman told an Associated Press reporter last night that if anyone attempts to change the status quo of Danzig by force, threatening Poland's independence, a world war will be inevitable, and Britain will participate in the war. A Polish government spokesman had said that if the National Socialist Party started an uprising in Danzig, a war would break out. Therefore, the Associated Press reporter in Britain asked the British government spokesman to clarify his country's attitude. (1st Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Poland's attitude toward Danzig appears to be hardening. An official spokesman said today that Polish authorities are aware of certain preparations in Danzig and are carefully monitoring them. If there is any action within Danzig, Poland will take countermeasures to deal with it. The spokesman also mentioned British Foreign Secretary Halifax's reaffirmation of British resistance to aggression, saying that this was a clear warning, and it would be a great misfortune for peace if this was not understood. Britain and Poland will regard any act of violence, whether originating from within the Free City of Danzig or from outside, as an act of war. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Political circles here attach great importance to the development of the situation in Danzig and say that the various military measures taken by the Danzig authorities are clearly intended to exert psychological pressure to force Poland to mobilize its economic and spiritual forces in the hope of destroying its resistance. Although Poland is still calm at this time, it will respond to any provocative actions with appropriate means. British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech the other day was the final warning to the totalitarian countries. In short, any attempt to change the status of the Free City of Danzig, whether it comes from outside or from within, must be regarded as a cause of war. This is what Britain sees, and it is the same as Poland's view. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Danzig: Twenty German planes flew over Danzig today, heading to East Prussia. Many army leaders, all in military uniform, arrived here on express trains to take command of the Free Army. The Stormtroopers are patrolling the streets under the new name of the Internal Guard. At the same time, many Poles are also entering the city. The National Socialist Party says that Poland is now adopting German tactics and may strike first. Whether or not this is true, the residents of Danzig cannot help but become more fearful when they see German planes flying over, Polish artillery positions, and military installations outside the Danzig border. Although League of Nations Commissioner for Danzig Burckhardt has not made a statement, he attaches great importance to the current situation. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Port of Gdynia, Poland: According to news obtained here, several German ships have arrived in the Free City of Danzig, fully loaded with military supplies and ammunition, mostly anti-aircraft guns and cannons. It is heard that they will be installed along the border of the city and on the mountains surrounding the city. In addition, after the National Socialist Party organized volunteer corps in Danzig, Germans flocked to join. The corps will be named the "Danzig Patriotic Corps." All these actions are intended to gradually arm Danzig, which is a blatant violation of the city's de jure status. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The "Exchange Telegraph" reported last night, citing Polish sources, that sixteen cannons were transported by tugboat from the town of Kempen, East Prussia, to Danzig last night. It is not known how big the cannons are, but there are said to be several anti-aircraft guns among them. It is claimed that hundreds of National Socialist stormtroopers have also arrived in Danzig.

<p>(London) The situation in the Free City of Danzig was recently analyzed by well-informed sources here, stating that Germany is using gradual means to annex the Free City of Danzig into German territory. The signs can be seen in the following facts: German youth are flocking to the Free City of Danzig to join the volunteer corps organized by the National Socialist Party, and various weapons, especially cannons, are being imported into the city from Germany. Germany is taking various military measures along the Vistula River. It is rumored that Fuehrer Hitler will visit Danzig on July 20. The general trend is that Germany's steps to annex Danzig will begin with the city council officially declaring its merger with Germany. At that time, German Aviation Minister Goering will visit the city to test Poland's reaction. If there is no strong reaction, Germany will only notify the countries of the matter, and there will be no need to intervene. British Conservative Party figures also said that the key to war and peace depends entirely on Poland's attitude. If the country goes to war with Germany, Britain will immediately provide assistance without any doubt. In addition, British Ambassador to Germany Henderson and Ambassador to Poland Kennard will return home on vacation, but in fact, they will discuss the relations between Germany and Poland with Foreign Secretary Halifax. In the view of some Conservative Party members, the British government should not only make strong speeches at this time but also take all necessary measures. Therefore, Conservative Party figure Churchill and Labor Party representatives should be recruited into the cabinet to show that Britain will never allow acts of aggression to happen again.

<p>(Berlin) Foreign political circles here discussed this afternoon the rumor that Hitler will visit Danzig around July 20. Officials do not deny this, but say they have no absolute reason to believe it is true. They believe that Hitler may not be planning this so early. It is rumored that before Hitler sets off, National Socialist figures such as Aviation Minister Goering will visit Danzig in advance, and Germany intends to abandon the practice of notifying the Polish authorities in advance of German dignitaries visiting Danzig.

<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to make a radio speech on Sunday (July 2) to reiterate Britain's determination to resist aggression and to emphasize that Britain is fully prepared. In addition, there has been no confirmation of the rumor that Fuehrer Hitler will personally visit the Free City of Danzig, and political circles here have not commented on it, saying only that Britain's attitude has been explained by Foreign Secretary Halifax and does not need to be repeated. British Ambassador to Poland, Sir Kennard, will soon return home on vacation and will hold important talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax on the situation in Poland. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>

It is said that the Polish ambassador to France, Łukasiewicz, and the French ambassador to Poland, Noël (currently in Paris), have provided him with various intelligence, indicating that no immediate incidents are likely to occur in Danzig. However, the current situation still requires close attention. In the event of any incident, England and France will definitely fulfill their obligations of mutual assistance to Poland. This has been explicitly stated by members of the English and French cabinets in recent days. Furthermore, the Foreign Minister also discussed the ongoing negotiations between England, France, and the Soviet Union, and reported on the new instructions issued by the English and French governments to their respective ambassadors to the Soviet Union. After the meeting, Foreign Minister Bonnet immediately met with Polish Ambassador Łukasiewicz to discuss the current European situation and the progress of financial negotiations between England and Poland.

<p>(Paris) The French newspapers, in discussing the recent developments in Danzig, all strongly emphasize that the main hope for peace lies in the firm attitude of the democratic nations. "Le Figaro" states that the senators of Danzig should weigh the great responsibility they bear. When the Germans demand their rights in Danzig, our only reply is: Prague. "Le Journal de Paris" states that unless the Axis powers have lost their control and are misled by useless adventurism, they should no longer doubt the determination of others. "Le Populaire" states that if the German people understand the speeches of British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Premier Daladier, it could bring about a decisive force for peace, because dictators must ultimately consider that those who are attacked or threatened will inevitably resist with force.

<p>(London) The British National Council of Labor, representing the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party, has drafted an appeal to the German people and workers everywhere, urging them to uphold the principle that international disputes should be resolved rationally and not by force. The document, titled "Madness is Mutual Slaughter," asks, "Who is responsible for the situation today?" It says: "Some of you may think that European peace is currently threatened because enemies are encircling Germany and want to destroy it, preventing the German people from enjoying economic life. This is a heinous misunderstanding. Your propaganda minister knows this. Many European powers will unite closely to seek self-defense. British labor urges the government to adopt this policy. This is not to harm Germany, but to ensure that aggression does not succeed, thereby maintaining world peace." "The times are sharp and increasingly reckless. The seizure of Czechoslovakia has made us feel that your government's purpose is nothing more than to dominate all of Europe and enslave all nations. Now, it is preparing for war, spreading lies and propaganda, and inciting unrest, using familiar techniques to antagonize Poland. You should know that if these actions continue, the result will be war. We all embrace the principle of 'butter is better than guns,' but we cannot succumb to the intimidation and threats of a self-respecting dictator. We cannot continue to make concessions to dictators under the threat of force. We can only build a happy, secure, and prosperous world through peaceful cooperation. We absolutely do not want to encircle your country and tear it apart. We urge you to abide by the rules." (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>(London) Regarding Germany's abrogation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British government submitted a response some time ago, explaining the British position. Naval sources here recently stated that the government will urge Germany to clarify its intentions regarding shipbuilding plans, especially the tonnage and caliber of cruisers. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement stipulates that cruiser tonnage is limited to 8,000 tons and the caliber of guns may not exceed 6 inches. However, because Britain has already built several 10,000-ton cruisers, Germany was also allowed to build five such cruisers in fairness. Now, if Germany adds more 10,000-ton cruisers beyond the five to expand its naval power, Britain will invoke the safeguard clauses in the Naval Agreement and, after notifying England, the United States, Italy, the Soviet Union, and the Scandinavian countries, immediately revise its current cruiser construction plan to cope with the situation.

This sentiment is also expressed by "Il Giornale d'Italia," which states that "If war breaks out in the future, Turkey will inevitably send troops to Egypt to defend the security of the Suez Canal. This will pose a very serious threat to Italy, whose territories border both Libya and Egypt. Therefore, if the Egypt-Turkey mutual assistance agreement is actually established under the auspices of England and France, the Italian government will sooner or later send an important note to the British ambassador, reminding him of the provision in the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 16, 1938, that the two countries would exchange military intelligence, and urging him to pay attention to this."

<p>(London) British Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare told the House of Commons yesterday that the government is prepared to build a house that is half-separated from London's famous women's prison, Holloway, for the purpose of housing female prisoners. Hoare's announcement is the second step in prison reform since he took office in the Home Office. He said that he very much hoped that the location and buildings of the new prison would be as different from the old prisons as possible. The new prison will not have high walls, only short walls four feet above the ground, surrounded by trees and various plants, in order to avoid the hideous state of 19th-century prisons. The location of the new prison cannot be announced for the time being, but it is located in the suburbs not far from London and covers an area of about 150 acres. Everything in the new prison will be self-sufficient. Each house can accommodate 25 people, one female superintendent, and a full set of kitchen furniture. Public facilities include a medical team, a chapel, a workshop, an entertainment and education hall, and a garden. In addition, there will be small-scale farming. The new prison can accommodate 400 to 500 female prisoners. Holloway Prison currently can only accommodate 350 female prisoners. Female prisoners with alcoholism in Holloway Prison will not be housed in the new prison, but will be placed in another prison, otherwise, they will cause many obstacles when training other female prisoners.

<h3 id="e45">Soviet Steel Industry Develops: Production Accounts for 25% of World's Total, Electric Steel Plant Completes Half-Year Plan <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The "Electric Steel Plant," the largest factory in the Soviet Union specializing in the production of high-grade steel, completed its production plan for the first half of the year yesterday. By the end of this year, steel production is expected to exceed the plan by 1,000 tons. (TASS Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>TASS Moscow Correspondence, June: Before the revolution, Russia's steel production accounted for only 5.6% of the world's total. In 1938, the Soviet Union produced about 15 million tons, accounting for 25% of the world's total. Within two five-year plans, the Soviet Union has established many large steel plants, such as the Magnitogorsk, Kuznetsk, and Krivoy Rog integrated plants. Existing factories have also been thoroughly renovated. During this period, 60 blast furnaces, 148 open-hearth furnaces, 96 rolling mills, and 9 ironmaking and forging plants were opened nationwide. The total investment in the steel industry was 10.8 billion rubles. The production capacity of all new equipment is greater than that of the old ones. For example, the volume of blast furnaces in the Kuznetsk and Magnitogorsk plants reached 1,163 and 1,180.3 cubic meters, respectively. Those recently installed in the Zaporozhye Steel Plant and the Azov Steel Plant are even larger, reaching 1,300 cubic meters.</p>
<p>In 1928, the total volume of all blast furnaces in the Soviet Union was 20,000 cubic meters. By 1937, it had increased to 48,600 cubic meters. In 1928, there were no Martin steel furnaces in the country with a production capacity of more than 100 tons. In 1937, there were 66 such furnaces. The establishment of new factories alone is not enough to show the development of steel production in two five-year plans. The more efficient utilization of existing factories is an important factor. In 1939, the Soviet Union's index of utilization of all steel furnace capacity was equal to that of the best factories in Europe and the United States. The average steel production per cubic meter of its steel furnaces reached 4.78 tons, and outstanding Stakhanovite workers produced 10 to 12 tons per square meter.</p>
<p>On the opening day of the third plenary session of the Supreme Soviet, two workers at the No. 3 blast furnace of the Zaporozhye Steel Plant broke the world record, producing 1,976 tons of steel, while the original plan was 1,300 tons. During the second five-year plan, iron production increased by 150%, steel production increased by 220%, rolled steel increased by 200%, and high-grade rolled steel increased by 270%. The increase in the production of high-grade steel was even more rapid. In 1936, the Soviet Union's production of electric steel ranked first in the world. The third five-year plan stipulates that the development of the steel industry will be as follows: 30 new blast furnaces, 56 Martin steel furnaces, and 34 rolling mills will be built. The Urals, Siberia, and the Far East will be the main areas for the construction of new integrated plants. It is estimated that by the end of the plan, the iron produced in the Urals and the Far East will account for 35% of the total in the Soviet Union. The third five-year plan pays particular attention to the production of special steel. Before the revolution, Russia never manufactured this type of steel. It is now stipulated that by the end of the aforementioned plan, 19 of the 108 blast furnaces should specialize in the production of special steel in order to refine it into special steel. Because during the planning period, the production of pig iron and steel should increase by more than 50%, so that the national pig iron production should reach 22 million tons and steel should reach 28 million tons.</p>

<p>(Washington) Regarding the currency law issue, the compromise plan passed by a joint conference of the Senate and the House of Representatives (deciding to restore the government's power to purchase silver abroad and change the gold content of the dollar) was submitted to the Senate for discussion yesterday afternoon. Senator Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland, first used delaying tactics, delivering a lengthy speech explaining his reasons for opposition. Senator Taft, a Republican from Ohio, also gave a speech, speaking incessantly until midnight, when the current currency law expired. The government authorities will therefore have to submit a new bill to both houses of Congress to remedy the situation. Observers have commented on the results of last night's Senate discussion, saying that from now on, the president will have no power to change the gold content of the dollar, and the exchange stabilization fund of $2 billion has no legal basis. The government's purchase of silver abroad no longer has a fixed price and will be based on the world market standard. However, the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 is still valid, and the Treasury Department can purchase silver as needed. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)</p>

The president's power expires at midnight. Republican senators deliberately used obstructionist tactics to prevent the bill from being voted on before midnight. However, the government side claimed that if the bill is passed after midnight, the president's power will remain the same. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) A joint conference of the Senate and the House of Representatives passed a compromise bill last night, stipulating that: (1) President Roosevelt may still enjoy the power to change the gold content of the dollar and purchase silver abroad; (2) The Exchange Stabilization Fund may continue to be maintained (the total fund is $2 billion); (3) The domestic silver purchase price is set at 70 cents per ounce. The House of Representatives approved it today by a vote of 229 to 160, and it was immediately transferred to the Senate for discussion. However, opposition senators in that chamber still attempted to obstruct it, intending to use delaying tactics to prevent the compromise bill from being voted on before midnight today. Republican Senators Townsend, Vandenberg, Taft, and Democratic Senators Adams and Holt all planned to deliver lengthy speeches during the meeting to consume time. Democratic Senator Holt told a Havas reporter that he would speak for at least two or three hours. If the delaying tactics succeed, the government can still continue to purchase silver abroad because the House of Representatives has already approved it. (Havas Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt told reporters today when asked if the US's decision to continue to purchase silver abroad has anything to do with friendly relations with China. The president replied that this policy is only one of the motivations for continuing to purchase silver abroad, and there are other important reasons, namely that the exchange rates of Latin American currencies can be maintained stable. Now that the joint committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives has passed the compromise plan, deciding to restore the government's power to purchase silver abroad and change the gold content of the dollar, it is heard that the Republican senators intend to use delaying tactics to obstruct the establishment of the compromise plan. The power to decide on the bill originally rests with the senators, and public opinion will have a fair assessment of whether they are doing good or bad. It is also heard that a certain senator will make a two- or three-hour long speech during the Senate discussion to hinder the proceedings, so that by midnight today (when the power to purchase silver and change the gold content of the dollar expires), the Senate will still be unable to submit it for voting. If so, it may not be approved by public opinion. If the compromise plan can be passed in time, I can personally go to Congress before midnight to sign it and make it law. Otherwise, I will have to submit another bill, requesting the Senate and the House of Representatives to vote on it. As for the purchasing power of silver, if the validity period is not extended, how the Treasury Department will act with foreign silver, especially with silver produced domestically, is something I cannot foresee. The various experts of the department are studying it from various perspectives. (Havas Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e48">U.S. House of Representatives Passes New Neutrality Act: Bloom's Proposal Amended, Automobiles and Airplanes Not Banned, Major Defeat for the Government <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the neutrality legislation, the House of Representatives yesterday evening passed the proposal of Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, along with the amendment proposed by Republican Congressman Vorys, by a majority of 200 votes to 188. The main provisions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If the President or Congress determines that a state of war exists between certain countries, it shall be declared. From the date of declaration, U.S. citizens and businesses (A) shall not sell arms and ammunition (excluding military supplies) to belligerent countries, unless the ownership of such arms and ammunition has been transferred to the people of other countries. (B) Shall not provide loans or credit to belligerent countries, except for ordinary short-term commercial loans with a term not exceeding ninety days. (C) Shall not raise funds for belligerent countries. (2) U.S. citizens who wish to travel on ships of belligerent countries shall be responsible for their own safety. (3) The President has the authority to prohibit warships and armed merchant ships of belligerent countries from entering U.S. ports or territorial waters. (4) This neutrality law does not apply to Latin American countries. Generally, people are commenting that it is noteworthy that "military supplies" are not included as prohibited items in this neutrality law. What exactly is meant by "military supplies" is also worth studying. According to congressional sources, it refers to items such as automobiles and airplanes. Although the original neutrality law had included automobiles and airplanes as prohibited items, the new neutrality law does not consider them as weapons of war. This is the main difference. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the neutrality legislation, political observers here have stated that the passage of the amendment proposed by Republican Congressman Vorys, incorporated into the proposal of House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, is a major defeat for the government. Secretary of State Hull has repeatedly stated that the U.S. government is unwilling to restrict the sale of arms and ammunition to belligerent countries in the new neutrality law. The Vorys amendment has introduced some restrictions on this type of trade, but the specific methods of restriction still need to be clearly defined. There are three reasons why President Roosevelt suffered this defeat: (1) The Republican Party has largely united. When the bill was put to a vote, all but two Republican congressmen voted in favor of the Vorys amendment. This unity is the first time it has happened in months. (2) Many Democratic congressmen defected, which was unexpected. (3) Democratic leaders only recently explained to the congressmen that amending the Bloom proposal would cause major international repercussions, and that the Vorys amendment would encourage European aggressor nations, but this explanation came too late to be effective. Fortunately, this neutrality legislation has only passed in the House and has not yet become law. It can be amended when it is brought before the Senate for discussion in the future. However, the general public is deeply concerned that the Senate may not bring it up for discussion within this session. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the neutrality legislation, the bill proposed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom was brought up for continued discussion by the House of Representatives. Republican Congressman Case of South Dakota proposed an amendment to the clause of the Bloom bill that the various provisions of the new neutrality law should not apply to Latin American countries. Democratic Congressman Johnson of Illinois immediately expressed his opposition, saying that this amendment contradicted the commitments accepted by the U.S. government to Latin American countries in previous Pan-American conferences. Subsequently, the amendment was rejected by a show of hands. Republican Congressman Loving of Kentucky gave a speech opposing the supply of arms to belligerent countries, stating that the first step of the U.S. supplying arms would inevitably lead to the second step of sending troops to fight abroad. Therefore, he could not agree with Bloom's original proposal to abolish the arms embargo. Republican Congresswoman Rogers of Massachusetts then proposed an amendment, stating that regarding whether warships and submarines of belligerent countries should be allowed to enter U.S. ports, according to the Bloom bill, the President has the full authority to decide, and that this should be restricted. This amendment was ultimately rejected by the House of Representatives by a show of hands. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the neutrality legislation, the House of Representatives discussion has entered the final stage and a concrete decision will soon be made. As of now, the discussion has only served to confuse the amendment issue. Several congressmen have temporarily proposed amendments, such as the amendment proposed by Republican Congressman Vorys (prohibiting the transport of arms and military aircraft to belligerent countries), which is one example. The indecisive attitude of the majority of the House of Representatives congressmen can also be seen here. The Vorys amendment only advocates for the prohibition of the export of various arms and military aircraft. The intention is to distinguish between purely war weapons and various items that can be used for war. It was ultimately passed by a majority of two votes, which shows that although Secretary of State Hull has explained in detail that this distinction is impossible in terms of reason or practicality, many Democratic congressmen still do not understand or have forgotten. In addition, the congressmen who have expressed their opinions seem to be avoiding the issue of how the U.S. attitude might affect the development of the European situation, and are only concerned with what kind of reaction their disclosed views will have domestically. This is quite noteworthy. In essence, the discussion is still focused on theory. The congressmen who have expressed their opinions are unwilling to create a law that would favor either side in the future between belligerent countries. They are determined to prevent the U.S. from being drawn into the vortex of war. On the government side, they are distracted by the issue of extending the validity of monetary and financial powers, and have been unable to fully address the neutrality legislation issue. This is another reason for the chaotic situation. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Promoting British Foreign Propaganda: Resolution of the Imperial Press Conference <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(London) Sir Roderick Jones, Chairman of Reuters, stated at the Imperial Press Conference today that "printed words" should be used to show the value of the weapons in Britain's defense capabilities. Sir Jones said that the dissemination of printed words is well organized, reaches far and wide, and its results are effective and lasting. Although the BBC's broadcasts in English and foreign languages have achieved remarkable results and the number of listeners is increasing daily, the circulation of newspapers today is greater than before, and the number of readers of printed words is greater than before. Newspapers are a method of reporting to the entire population, and no country can ignore or underestimate their value. The amount of printed words released by powerful national governments today is enormous. This kind of news propaganda can only be dealt with effectively by a news agency of the highest British character. This agency has been established for a long time, and British news agencies are able to penetrate most foreign countries and places. However, the agency operates purely on a commercial basis, and can no longer compete in terms of news quantity with foreign news agencies subsidized with huge government funds by powerful nations. The competition is especially fierce in Europe and the Far East. If a way is not found to use this British news agency with global reach to disseminate a sufficient amount of news to counteract subsidized competitors, and to ensure that British newspapers receive not only news and opinions from Britain, but also British accounts of international events to supplement and correct accounts provided by other sources, and if this goal cannot be achieved, then British principles and the principles of the Empire and the Dominions, as far as we are concerned, will be damaged in the eyes of the rest of the world. Sir Jones also said that the question is how to put British news in a position to compete with competitors financially in foreign countries, without the appearance of being subsidized and without losing its reputation for independence. The conference then held a discussion, and all agreed with Sir Jones's views, unanimously passing the resolution proposed by Member of Parliament Sir Read as follows: "This Association recognizes the work of the BBC and other news agencies in promoting the British foreign publicity. It urges the government to encourage, by all means within its power, the increase in the dissemination of British news and international news from Britain to foreign newspapers through existing non-official channels, in order to correct the news disseminated by heavily subsidized foreign news agencies."

<h3 id="e53">The Fate of Europe and Asia Is Inseparable <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Di</p>
<p>Japan Threatens Britain Due to British Public Opinion Advocates Sanctions Against Japan; At the Same Time, It Can End the Sino-Japanese War - European Correspondence</p>
<p>(1) Extremely Obvious Example</p>
<p>The inseparability of the fate of Europe and Asia - there is no better example than these two recent events to give a powerful illustration. The last time was two weeks ago, when the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement was established with a great fanfare, Japan in the Far East suddenly created a tense situation on the Outer Mongolian border; the meaning was: if Britain directly establishes a complete board of directors alliance with Soviet Russia, then it must also consider the possibility of being dragged into war with Japan. The British government immediately felt this intention, but most of the reaction was to dismiss it with a laugh. The British put some considerations much bigger and more important when it comes to the importance of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. As it seemed at the time, present-day Japan, added to Franco's Spain, was still not as weighty as Turkey on the scale of the British government's alliance with or against the Soviets. So, in those days when the Anglo-Soviet negotiations began, Britain was willing to intensify its contact with Turkey, and quietly set aside Japan and Spain. Later, as soon as the news of the already irreversible fact was confirmed, the weight on the side of the scale opposing integration with the Soviet Union was greatly reduced again.</p>
<p>It is a fact that, because of the difficult birth of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, they took the opportunity to show goodwill to the Japanese government. It is also a fact that, as one of the excuses for opposing complete integration with the Soviet Union, some British people often cited Japan's attitude. However, this time, the progress and difficulties of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations can be said to have nothing directly to do with whether or not Japan opposed them.</p>
<p>However, that being said, if the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance had been established today, then why would the incident of Japan's coercion of Britain in Tianjin have occurred again now in the Far East? On the Japanese side, perhaps they misunderstood the weight of their Outer Mongolian border demonstration on the difficulty of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations last time, so perhaps they were thinking: if Britain is afraid of Japan's strength and even hesitates to ally with Soviet Russia, then, due to the same fear, what attitude in Britain could there be towards the Sino-Japanese War that could not succumb to Japanese threats? So, they boldly put forward a request to Britain that Britain would never accept: complete cooperation with Japan to create a "New Order in East Asia!"</p>
<p>However, the incident is not that simple. At this time, when Japan suddenly took such action, the greater part of the source still has to be attributed to the current European situation. What exactly is the current European situation? This is beyond the scope of this article, but the concise situation can be summarized into three points: (1) The Anglo-Soviet negotiations have made no progress, and there is probably no great hope in the near future; (2) Germany and Italy are planning to create another crisis in Europe; (3) Germany and Italy's work to win over Japan is still in progress.</p>
<p>It is very obvious to anyone now: Japan's coercion of Britain this time is actually its last bargaining chip on whether or not to join the German-Italian Axis. After this failure, it will probably formally join the German-Italian-Spanish group and conclude a military alliance with them. Therefore, in the past two days, the Japanese ambassador to Italy has arrived in Berlin and cooperated with his ambassador to Germany to maintain close contact with the German authorities. At the same time, from the standpoint of urging the early realization of the German-Italian-Japanese-Spanish military alliance, Hitler naturally agreed with Japan's attempt to make such a final bargaining chip to the British Chamberlain cabinet.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance will appear after the German-Japanese-Italian-Spanish military alliance.</p>
<p>(2) A Golden Opportunity</p>
<p>In the past two days, because of the Japanese soldiers and ruffians in Tianjin's utmost insult to Britain, the British newspapers have been filled with such records. The excitement of public opinion can be said to have reached its peak. However, if you observe it carefully, you can immediately discover: all this is not tense. Now Britain has a clear and accurate estimate of Japan's economic, military, manpower, and all other aspects. Britain at the moment certainly does not want to go to war with Japan; however, because of Japan's difficult situation, they dare not have a large-scale conflict with Britain, and dare not even risk a large-scale conflict.</p>
<p>On this matter, in the past two days, I have had many discussions with some people in Britain. Their unanimous conclusion is; the focus of the problem still lies in whether the current British government under the leadership of Prime Minister Chamberlain is willing to make a decision; if it is willing, then even if it wants to completely sanction Japan and end the Japanese aggression against China in one fell swoop, it is by no means a difficult task. And now is the best time.</p>
<p>Their reasons are: (1) Although the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is difficult to give birth to, their position of assisting China is more or less consistent. Then, at this time when the alliance is difficult to give birth to, it is best to do a concrete test of cooperation on the issue of assisting China as the first step of the future alliance. (2) The U.S. fleet has been transferred back to the Pacific, and at present, the overall war has not yet broken out, which is the time when Japan is most afraid of the U.S. (3) The Soviet Red Army in the Far East has an absolute advantage over the Japanese forces stationed in Manchuria, and at present, Germany and Italy are powerless in the West, which is the time when Japan is most afraid of the Soviet Union. (3) Japan's war against China has completely fallen into a passive position. Therefore, if the current Chamberlain government has really made up its mind and plans to completely cut Japan back to size and make it submit, then, under the current situation, the method is relatively simple and predictable. For example: first, contact the Chinese government to guarantee large-scale material assistance from the UK, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States. On the Chinese side, a full-scale general offensive will be launched immediately; second, correspondingly, the Soviet Union will concentrate even more military power in the Far East, giving Japan a most deadly threat; third, the naval forces of the UK, US, and France in the Far East will concentrate in certain areas to hold demonstrations; then the fourth step is to send Japan an ultimatum, convening an international conference such as the Nine-Power Conference to resolve all disputes between China and Japan. In this way, at that time, there will only be two paths in front of Japan: either to submit to pressure and end its war of aggression against China; or, conversely, to take a further step and join the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>"Perhaps the possibility of taking the latter path is greater," I said.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. Because in that case, even the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Spain would be very problematic and could not be relied upon by Japan." What's more, at a minimum, "this can promote the formal establishment of the world's anti-aggression front."</p>
<p>As for the attitude of China, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, it can be said that it is not a problem. As long as Britain is determined. The current situation is so obvious. The British authorities are fully aware of these. Therefore, in the past two days, according to what we can know and see, the British have been issuing warnings, implied, formally, privately, and in terms of public opinion; "Danger!" "Danger!" "Your fatal point is already here!" "If we take action!" ... and so on.</p>
<p>(3) The Considerations of the British Government</p>
<p>If we say that the Japanese militarists are completely numb to the above situation, then that may not be the case; probably they expected that the current British government would never take the above step, so they dared to insult Britain with confidence and impunity. However, we must know that Britain's current basic position in the Far East will never change in any way because of Japan's disturbances, especially at the present time when the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is in progress, and when the Sino-British friendship is at its closest. The British government's only consideration now is: how to find a path that is most suitable for itself in these complex international relations, so as to get through Japan's current coercion. There are still very many such paths on the British side. However, if Japan stubbornly adheres to its own views and mistakenly believes that Britain's indecisive actions are due to weakness, or is forcing it to cooperate to create a "New Order in East Asia," then, in the end, Britain may be forced to take the thorough approach mentioned above.</p>
<p>I repeat here once again: it is absolutely impossible to cooperate with Japan to create a "New Order in East Asia" from any angle, according to the current situation! Absolutely impossible! (Sent from London, June 16)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Punan Puppet Police Carry Weapons to Revolt: Eight Detachments Take the Opportunity to Attack, Japanese Troops Deploy a Large Brigade to Reinforce Sanguantang Becomes a War Zone <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Punan Communication: Nanyu Town in Punan is the seat of Fengxian County. In order to control the traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway, the Japanese army spent a huge price to occupy it. In addition to stationing more than 300 troops from the Japanese Army's Masajima Detachment, the puppet "Great Way City Government" also allocated 200-300 puppet police officers under the command of the Fengxian Puppet Government. For the past four months, there was nothing more. So the Japanese side had gradually relaxed their defense. Recently, they had transferred the garrisoned troops to Minhang, leaving only 30-40 guards at the headquarters to supervise the puppet police in patrols. However, most of these police officers were conscripted young men from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Shandong, who had been forced to join. Usually, because of strict surveillance, they had endured the pain and obeyed. Now, seeing an opportunity, they secretly gathered and plotted. On the evening of June 26, while the Japanese army was resting, they first sent a small team to fire guns in all directions. At the same time, they sent a team to attack the Japanese military headquarters, killing five Japanese soldiers and one platoon leader. The Japanese army was caught off guard and fled for their lives. They seized machine guns, heavy artillery, and important documents on the spot. On the dawn of the 27th, they organized their troops and left Nanyu, and set up defenses and revolted in the four villages of Sanguantang. Before this, the supervisor had already contacted Yu Taosheng, the commander of the Second Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army stationed in the eastern part of Fengxian, and reached an agreement. So Yu sent personnel to incorporate them. On the other hand, Dai Jiyi, the magistrate of Fengxian County, personally went to comfort them. They brought a total of 340 new-style rifles, 14 machine guns, 10 artillery pieces, and dozens of boxes of ammunition. The police were full of energy. Four-tenths of them were originally National Army soldiers who had been captured during the retreat from Nanjing and had no time to escape. They saw the light of day again and cheered like thunder. At the same time, Ding Xisan, the commander of the Eighth Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army stationed along the coast in the western part of Fengxian, took advantage of the mixed battles between the Japanese army and the police revolting, and sent troops from Qianliqiao and Zhelin to attack Nanqiao. They arrived on the outskirts of the town on the 28th night, and met with the Japanese army's reinforcement troops transferred from Minhang halfway. They fired machine guns at each other, holding each other for six hours. The Japanese army exhausted their strength and only used artillery bombardment. However, the National Salvation Army used a scattered line of troops, with a maximum of 20 people at each stronghold. The artillery fire caused little damage. Yesterday, both sides used the Zhang village, five or six miles away from Sanguantang, as a battle line. The militia led by Dai Jiyi, the magistrate of Fengxian County, were stationed in front of Shenhang, which is a strategic waterway in the battlefield. All Japanese military speedboats passed through this waterway. Yesterday morning (29), they sank a wooden-hulled boat, killing two Japanese soldiers. It was also learned that after this incident, the Japanese army disarmed all puppet officials and police officers, interrogated them separately, and sent troops to search house by house yesterday, and many people were arrested. In the past few days, the Japanese side has transferred troops from various places, about 1,000 people. The National Salvation Army is also drawing elites from various detachments and sending them to the front line, under the unified command of Ding Xisan. When this reporter filed the report, the two sides were still in fierce fighting. The 　 War Zone Commander-in-Chief recently assigned Punan to the jurisdiction of the Shanghai-Songhu Military Commissioner, who divided it into the Second Route and appointed Ruan as the commander-in-chief to reorganize the miscellaneous troops. Four large detachments have been established, stationed along the coast, with considerable strength. The 62nd Division and 75th Brigade of the regular army, which were reorganized and trained in eastern Zhejiang, arrived by sea and have been stationed along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang for a long time. According to reports from Jinshanwei, a small part of these troops opened the way to Zhelin on the 29th. The Japanese army in the Zhangyan area had dispatched hundreds of troops (with the numbers Nakagawa) from Pinghu a few days ago, and turned to the coast to defend. It is feared that the two sides will come into contact soon.</p>

<p>A Yangzhou dispatch reports that on the 16th, at 8 a.m., twenty to thirty Japanese cavalry soldiers arrived from Xishan. Currently, including the originally stationed troops, there are over four hundred Japanese and puppet soldiers in Yangzhou City. In recent days, the defense has been greatly intensified. More sentries have been added at each city gate. About twenty more puppet sentries have been added at Dongguan and Bianyimen. Also, a machine gun and a small artillery piece have been set up on each of the city walls.</p>
<p>The Japanese commander in Yangzhou, Ogawa, committed suicide previously because of a love affair. His position as commander was initially filled by the chief of the special service squad as an agent. Recently, Japanese Lieutenant General Iwamatsu arrived in Yangzhou from Nanjing for inspection. Due to the frequent attacks on Yangzhou by the Chinese army and the widespread revolts by the Big Sword Society, which posed threats from all sides, Iwamatsu returned to Nanjing and immediately proposed transferring the Japanese commander in Shaobo, Saito, to be the Japanese commander in Yangzhou. The Japanese troops in Shaobo would also be under Saito's command.</p>
<p>The puppet governor of Yangzhou, Fang Xiaoting, has returned to Yangzhou from Suzhou. His family members have all moved to the Shanghai foreign concessions to take refuge. Furthermore, Fang and the puppet police chief, Wu Xiaohou, have disagreements and are mutually attacking each other with the puppet provincial government. There are rumors that Fang may be dismissed, and it is said that a Mr. Jiang, the director of the puppet property management office, may succeed him as puppet governor.</p>
<p>The majority of the puppet troops stationed in Mount Wutai have recently awakened and intend to revolt. The Japanese side has dispatched over twenty soldiers to monitor their actions.</p>
<p>On the 14th, the Japanese troops in Shaobo held a puppet celebration meeting. While the atmosphere was enthusiastic, Chinese artillery suddenly bypassed Yangzhuang and fiercely bombarded Shaobo, firing over ten shells, destroying the Japanese headquarters. At the same time, the Chinese army also killed four Japanese soldiers and six puppet soldiers in a certain area south of Shaobo. The Japanese and puppet troops were terrified, and those attending the meeting fled in all directions.</p>
<p>Due to fear of attacks by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops in Xiannv Temple are actively constructing defensive fortifications. Iron barbed wire fences have been added from Dongjietou to Sanyuan Bridge and Jiangjia Bridge. Every night, Japanese and puppet troops patrol the area from Jiadu to Kongjiazhuang and Dafanzhuang, and a searchlight is used to illuminate the outside from the roof of the Japanese command headquarters. The Japanese commander in Xiannv Temple, Katsura, once convened a meeting of the nearby township heads and security chiefs, forcing them to blow horns as signals at night and patrol all night long. If any Chinese guerrillas are encountered, they are to sound gongs to alert the authorities. In addition, a Japanese soldier in Xiannv Temple deserted due to war-weariness, taking away a firearm and over forty clips of ammunition. On the 19th, the Japanese headquarters announced martial law and conducted a house-to-house search, but he has not been found.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Current Financial Situation in Fujian Province: Sixty Thousand Shortfall in Revenue in May; Second Round of Personnel Cuts and Government Reduction <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>A Fuzhou dispatch reports that, according to a report from the Finance Department regarding the tax revenue situation in Fujian Province for the past five months, the revenue for January was over 1.51 million yuan, for February it was over 1.72 million yuan, for March it was over 1.22 million yuan, and for April it was over 1.27 million yuan. The average revenue for the above four months was over 1.4 million yuan per month. However, in May, the revenue was only over 800,000 yuan, a shortfall of about 600,000 yuan, which is the same amount as when Xiamen fell last May, when the provincial government relocated inland and the situation along the coast became suddenly tense. If this situation continues, by the end of the year, the province's income and expenditure will be short by about 5 million yuan. It has been found that there are two reasons for the shortfall in tax revenue in May: one is the off-season for tax collection, and the other is that Japanese aircraft and warships have been constantly harassing the coastal areas in recent months, disrupting transportation and causing import and export trade to stagnate. Considering the current situation in Fujian Province, the ways to increase financial revenue are becoming fewer and fewer. On the one hand, it is necessary to adhere to the established national policy of the central government, and on the other hand, it is necessary to consider the burden on the people and implement measures after careful consideration. Therefore, it is feared that another adjustment will be made to the financial revenue and expenditure, and a second round of government reduction and personnel cuts will be implemented so as to balance income and expenditure.</p>

<p>A Taixing dispatch reports that Yangzhong County is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and resembles a small island, situated between Jiangdu and Zhenjiang. After its fall, the Japanese side appointed Gu Xianchi as the puppet governor. Last month, Gu went to the Andong Hotel in Shanghai and was injured in an attack, with only Xu Zhibu, a rice merchant from Zhenjiang who was traveling with him, being killed. Subsequently, Gu returned to Zhenjiang to recuperate in the hospital. The morale of the people in Yangzhong is inherently strong, led by Guan Wenwei of the Jiangnan Righteous and Brave Advance Team. They took the opportunity to recapture Yangzhong a few days ago, and the puppet officials fled the town in panic, requesting the Japanese commander Maruyama to send troops to Yangzhong. However, the Japanese troops stationed in the town were insufficient to allocate, so the request was not granted.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Japan Plans to Periodically Blockade the Min River; Strengthened Blockade of the Oujiang Estuary; Explosives Deployed, Gap Not Sealed; Japanese Warships Bombard the Coast, Minimal Damage; British Consul in Fuzhou Advises British Nationals to Evacuate <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Foreign news reports that the British authorities here have announced that the Japanese Navy has agreed to extend the deadline for blockading the Min River to the 6th, allowing the British nationals in Fuzhou to evacuate at their leisure. The British Consul in Fuzhou is currently advising British nationals, women, and children to evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Oujiang Blockade Gap Not Sealed</p>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, the Chinese authorities in the Oujiang Estuary of Wenzhou, in order to strengthen the defense, have implemented a blockade, deploying plum blossom piles at the bottom of the water, but leaving a gap for navigation in and out of ships to maintain transportation. Subsequently, due to repeated harassment by Japanese warships, the military authorities added underwater mines and other explosives to prevent Japanese warships from intruding. Therefore, this measure had already been implemented. According to news from the shipping industry, due to the increasingly tense situation along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian in recent days, the Wenzhou authorities have again reinforced the fortifications at the Oujiang Estuary, sealing the gap. All ships are prohibited from sailing in the Oujiang River to strengthen coastal defense. However, it is not completely blocked like the Zhenhai Estuary. As for the rumor that the gap has been sealed, the shipping industry has not received any telegrams.</p>
<p>Vessels Prohibited from Entering and Exiting Zhenhai Estuary</p>
<p>According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the blockade of Zhenhai was ordered to be implemented by the commander of a certain group army on the 28th at noon. The Yin County Shipping Association received a notice at 4 p.m. and implemented it at 9 p.m. that night, prohibiting any ships from entering or exiting. However, whether the old Taiping Wheel was sunk to seal the gap remains a mystery as Shanghai has not received any telegrams. One account states that the gap has not been sealed.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Attempt to Land on Yuhuan Again</p>
<p>On the 30th, three Japanese warships off the coast of Yuhuan dispatched over a hundred Japanese soldiers to attempt to land again. They were met with strong resistance from the local defense forces and were unable to succeed. Currently, there are five Japanese warships anchored outside the port of Wenzhou. Although the situation is tense, there are no changes at present.</p>
<p>Movements of Japanese Warships Along the Min River</p>
<p>After the Japanese side declared that it would take military action against Fujian and landed at Jianfeng in the Min River Estuary, the situation in Fuzhou became tense. Yesterday, a telegram was received in Shanghai stating that about twenty-seven or eight Japanese warships are now gathered in the Min River area, anchored in places such as Mawei and Nanweitang. Apart from occasionally firing artillery shells at the shore and bombing by Japanese aircraft, there have been no other actions. The Chinese side is on high alert.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Bombard Yueqing Changmen</p>
<p>According to the shipping industry's reception yesterday afternoon, three Japanese warships arrived off the coast of Yueqing in the Prefecture of Wenzhou in the morning and bombarded the shore, also launching several motorboats full of Japanese soldiers attempting to land. They were met with strong resistance from the local garrison and were unable to succeed. On the morning of the 30th, two Japanese warships fired artillery at Changmen in the Min River Estuary. The local defense forces returned fire, and the Japanese warships left. Heavy troops are currently stationed at Changmen, and the defense is quite strict.</p>
<p>Zhenhai Bombed, Ningbo Peaceful</p>
<p>According to a telegram received by the shipping industry yesterday afternoon, Zhenhai was invaded by two groups of Japanese aircraft totaling eleven on the morning of the 29th at 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., taking turns dropping bombs and bombing the urban area. However, the residents there had been evacuated early, so apart from the destruction of some civilian houses, there were no deaths or injuries, and the damage was minimal. As for the situation in Ningbo Port, it is as peaceful as ever. However, since the suspension of navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo, commercial transportation has become more sparse, so the night market is more desolate than before, but the general population remains extremely calm.</p>
<p>Mao Fu Begins to Unload Cargo</p>
<p>The German merchant firm Rehder, which sailed to Ningbo on the morning of the 29th, arrived at the mouth of Zhenhai but was unable to enter due to the blockage of the gap. Regarding the passengers and cargo on board, they inquired with the defense headquarters, requesting permission to transship them to Ningbo. It is learned that permission has been granted, and the ship began hiring barges yesterday to transfer passengers and goods for entry. After the unloading is completed, it is scheduled to return to Shanghai empty in the next day or two.</p>
<p>British Ships Call at Wenzhou and Shantou as Usual</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, the traffic between Shanghai and Shantou has been decided by the British merchant firms Taikoo and Jardine Matheson to continue to be maintained. However, when the ships are protected by British warships for entry, the Japanese side prevents them from unloading cargo, only allowing passengers to disembark by small launches. Therefore, all ships departing from Shanghai still call at Wenzhou and Shantou. Taikoo's "Soochow" ship exited yesterday, and Jardine Matheson's "Yusheng" ship is scheduled to depart for Shantou on the 5th. The "Hesheng" and "Guisheng" ships are scheduled to depart on the 8th. Taikoo's new "Peking" ship went directly to Quanzhou yesterday morning to load passengers and goods.</p>
<p>Shenfu Arrives in Shanghai, Shenhua Turns Back</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired yesterday with the British merchant firm Ewo: (1) The "Shenhua" ship was blocked outside the mouth of the Oujiang River in Wenzhou. Now, because the Oujiang River has been blockaded with mines, it has turned back to Shanghai from Wenzhou. According to the shipowner's radio report, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8 a.m. this morning. (2) The "Shenfu" ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 9 a.m. from Chuanshi in Fuzhou, carrying cargo and over seventy refugees, and is docked at Huangpu River Buoys 26 and 27. (3) The "Shenguang" ship is still docked off the coast of Chuanshi, and the cargo has not yet been completely unloaded.</p>
<p>Navigation Interrupted, Ships Docked in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the defense commands of Ningbo and Wenzhou issued orders prohibiting navigation, the pleasure ships sailing to Ningbo and Wenzhou were forced to temporarily dock in Shanghai, causing the buoys and wharves along the Huangpu River to be fully occupied. It is estimated that there are more than ten ships, including "Deping," "Ende," "Consalvio," "Hana," "Fekon," "Baoli," "Meifa," and "Shantai." In recent days, these ships have had no choice but to temporarily dock outside the mouth of Wusong, waiting for the buoys and wharves to become available before entering the port to dock. In addition, British merchant ships such as "Xinxian Tai" have changed their routes to Shanghai and Tianjin.</p>
<p>Suspension of Priced Mail to Fujian Province</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 56 states that, effective immediately, this bureau will temporarily suspend acceptance of all priced mail sent to various locations in the Fujian region (excluding the port of Xiamen itself). This notice is hereby given to all for their information. The Director, Zha Peilin, June 30, Republic of China Year 28.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economy previously notified national goods groups in this city to collect various exquisite national goods samples from Shanghai for display in various territories in Nanyang in order to develop overseas sales of national goods. The China National Industries Association began processing this in early May. The first batch was closed in mid-June, but due to customs duty issues, the goods had not yet been loaded for shipment. The China National Industries Association has now telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the customs authorities be ordered to exempt them from customs duties. As soon as the reply telegram from the Ministry of Finance is received, the date can be determined for loading and shipping.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Repayment Methods for Principal and Interest of Consolidated Public Bonds Established; to Be Announced by the Ministry of Finance at the End of This Month; Private Securities Market Approved to Resume Trading on the 4th; – Fuxing Gold Bonds Regularly Drawn for Principal Repayment – <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has established repayment methods for domestic debts guaranteed by customs duties. The various bonds of the Consolidated Public Bonds will be repaid with principal and interest at the end of July. Fuxing Gold Bonds will be drawn regularly. The Shanghai private securities market has been approved to resume trading on July 4th. Details are as follows.</p>
<p>Established Methods for Consolidated Public Bonds</p>
<p>The seventh principal and interest repayment for the five types of bonds of the Republic of China Year 25 Consolidated Public Bonds, Types A, B, C, D, and E, is July 31st, according to the regulations, and will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted China and Communications Banks. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with the bank and learned that since the Ministry of Finance's announcement on January 15th of the methods for repaying the principal and interest of various debts guaranteed by customs duties, there is now a decision to maintain creditworthiness, which will be announced by the Ministry before the end of this month. As for the eighth drawing for principal repayment, it has been scheduled to be held monthly starting on August 10th.</p>
<p>Fuxing Gold Bonds Regularly Drawn</p>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee has sent letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the banking and money industries, and the Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, stating that the seventh drawing of the Republic of China Year 25 Fuxing Public Bonds is scheduled to be held at 10 a.m. on the 10th of this month. A total of five drawings will be made, with a principal repayment of 1.7 million yuan, to be paid by the Central Bank, etc., on August 31st. Please appoint supervisors and drawing personnel to carry out the drawing. As for the twelfth principal repayment drawing for the Republic of China Year 17 Long-Term Public Bonds, it has been internally scheduled to be held on September 10th.</p>
<p>Private Securities Market Resumes Trading</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with the banking sector and learned that the Shanghai private securities market was previously suspended due to the telegram from Chongqing unifying the suspension of payment of principal and interest on various debts, which led to a sharp drop in bond prices. Then, due to the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram restricting withdrawals and deposits, private market trading was declared temporarily suspended. Now, because the Ministry of Finance has decided on methods for repaying the principal and interest of consolidated debts, and at the same time, various debts guaranteed by customs duties are being drawn for principal repayment as usual, which proves that the government's policy of maintaining creditworthiness has not changed, the private market has decided to open and resume trading on July 4th.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Price Increases in All Industries Are Endless; Overcoming Living Difficulties Requires Thrift <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>In Shanghai, foreign exchange is tight and raw materials are expensive, so all industries have successively raised prices, and the livelihood of citizens is deeply threatened. It is learned that the packaged meal industry, the laundry and dyeing industry, the footwear industry, the painting and woodworking industry, the refining industry, the copper mold manufacturing industry, and the silk weaving trademark industry have all continued to raise prices since yesterday. The majority of citizens and salaried classes feel unable to bear this heavy burden of life. According to those concerned about social issues, in this extraordinary period, prices are rising endlessly. Whether mental or manual laborers, most salaries cannot keep pace with the price increases. Therefore, if one wants to overcome living difficulties, there is no other way than to be diligent and thrifty, practice economy, and promote the consumption of national and local goods.</p>
<h3 id="e63">After the Interruption of Shipping Between Shanghai and Zhejiang, Local Products Cannot Be Shipped to Shanghai; Speculators Raise Prices and Some Purchase and Hoard Firewood and Charcoal <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army forcibly landed in Dinghai (Zhoushan), the situation in eastern Zhejiang has become tense. In order to strengthen defense, the military authorities have successively blocked the gaps in Ningbo and Wenzhou, causing shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang to be completely interrupted, and local products from Ning Shao cannot be shipped to Shanghai for sale. For example, the most famous Shaoxing dried vegetables, Shaoxing yellow wine, firewood and charcoal from Huangyan and Wenzhou, and vegetables, fresh fruits, chickens, and ducks from Ningbo are all stockpiled in Ningbo and Wenzhou, waiting to be shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream once shipping resumes. However, it is heard that in the Shanghai market, because these local products cannot be shipped to Shanghai, general speculative merchants have all raised prices. Regarding firewood and charcoal, because there are sufficient reserves, there is no need to worry about shortages, but those manipulating the market see high prices and have all purchased and stockpiled them in order to sell them at a profit.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government of the Republic of China. Although the National Government has decided to combine this anniversary with the anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government on May 5th and separately designate July 7th as the Anti-Japanese War and National Reconstruction Memorial Day, due to the special situation in this city, in April of this year, various groups in the Public Concession and the French Concession agreed with the Public Concession Municipal Council and the French Concession Municipal Council to display the national flag for eight days each year. July 1st is one of the eight days, and after July 1st, it is the anniversary of Confucius' birthday on August 27th, while July 7th is not within the stipulated days. Therefore, yesterday, all sectors in this city still followed this agreement and displayed flags to celebrate.</p>

<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that today (the 1st) it received reliable information that on June 25th at 3 a.m., guerrillas attacked Hushu Pass, a small station between Suzhou and Wuxi on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. All Japanese troops stationed there were wiped out. The guerrillas, numbering about 350, belonged to the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Army. They conducted a night attack, approaching the station. The small team of Japanese troops was stationed in the camp above the station. The guerrillas first quietly "cleared" five Japanese soldiers on guard, then poured kerosene into the wooden huts where the troops were stationed, and</p>
<p>threw hand grenades</p>
<p>into the doorways. The wooden huts caught fire, killing all the Japanese soldiers inside, a total of twenty-three. The Japanese troops stationed there originally numbered twenty-five, but two had temporarily left the team to attend a wedding banquet in the countryside and were spared. However, according to another account, about fifty Japanese soldiers were killed in the raid, as Hushu Pass is an important town on the highway and railway, so a stronger force of Japanese troops was stationed there. Before retreating, the guerrillas also set fire to the station and</p>
<p>destroyed a section of railway,</p>
<p>halting traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai line for several days. Also, two weeks ago, a major battle took place outside the city of Changzhou, west of Wuxi. Two or three thousand Japanese soldiers were surrounded, and by the time reinforcements arrived, one thousand Japanese soldiers had been killed. It is believed that the attackers were regular Chinese troops dispatched to the eastern theater to conduct guerrilla warfare behind Japanese lines. In the past two months, the bus services</p>
<p>have all been suspended</p>
<p>between Wuxi and Changshu, and between Changzhou and Changshu. The service between Suzhou and Changshu has also been suspended several times due to buses being burned and bridges being destroyed. Recently, the Japanese army has been conscripting several thousand rickshaw pullers, farmers, travelers, and peddlers in Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Kunshan, and sending them to the local "front line," forcing some of them to build</p>
<p>defensive fortifications.</p>
<p>Others are dressed in Japanese army uniforms, given wooden guns, and forced to stand in front of the Japanese army, ordered to fight first, followed by these helpless civilians, then the security forces, and finally the Japanese army.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Reducing the Need for Legal Tender; Great Achievement of Interbank Clearing; Scheduled Implementation of Bank Registration; Financial Market Progress in Adapting to the Environment <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Banks and money shops are closed for three days starting yesterday to handle the mid-year settlement, and are scheduled to open for business on the 14th, implementing the new clearing system and centralized check clearing. Various industries are requesting tax payments be exempted from restrictions, and the overdraw balances be used as overdrafts. The entire Shanghai financial market system is gradually improving. Details are as follows.</p>
<p>Starting Registration</p>
<p>Since the banking and money industries association resolved to adjust the supply of funds between banks and meet commercial needs, from July 4th, interbank clearing will be handled, with the total amount temporarily set at 50 million national currency. Now, all banks and money shops have provided collateral, such as major commodities, company bonds and stocks with formal market prices, and real estate with rights in the Shanghai concessions, and registered with the Bank Joint Reserve Association. After the association assesses the value of the collateral, it will handle the use of interbank clearing, but it is stipulated that the use of clearing shall not exceed 70% of the assessed value of the collateral. As for the clearing preparation inspection committee, it will be established after representatives of various groups are appointed. It has been decided that the original organization will be used for the evaluation and custody committee.</p>
<p>Three Benefits</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with the banking sector yesterday and learned that there are three benefits to improving the interbank clearing system. First, the creditworthiness of frozen credits can be restored through the use of collateral. Second, this type of clearing is different from the original clearing in the market, as it is only for interbank clearing. There is no increase in the discount rate or disruption of the market, and it can be remitted to the interior for the purchase of local products. Third, after the implementation of this system, the market's capital increases, reducing the need for legal tender and assisting the government in implementing wartime financial policies. The Shanghai financial community, far from the reach of government power, diligently follows government laws and decrees, and in the midst of helplessness, contemplates a solution that benefits both sides. Their patriotic, firm, and creative actions are commendable.</p>
<p>Adapting to the Environment</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the reserve treasury by the Shanghai banking and money industries, followed by the circulation of public receipts and public treasury certificates, and the establishment of a check clearing house and a bill acceptance house, they have strived to create and adapt to the environment in dangerous and difficult situations. After the war, in addition to the government ordering the Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank, and Central Bank to establish a joint office and a discount committee to supply the market with funds, they have used the banking and money industries reserve treasury as the center to fulfill the responsibility of financial adjustment. The change in the check clearing system between the Bund and the Outer Bund, and the circulation of clearing funds in the market, all indicate the gradual progress and construction of the Shanghai financial market's currency situation.</p>
<p>Centralized Check Clearing</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of centralized check clearing, after it was approved by the banking and money industries association, it has been scheduled to be implemented simultaneously with the use of interbank clearing on July 4th. At the member representative meeting the other day, the Money Industry Association approved "All money shops should entrust banks to collect bank checks, and starting from July 4th, concentrate the opening of legal tender and clearing accounts in the money industry reserve treasury, and fully entrust the money treasury to handle it." It is heard that the clearing time for the bank check clearing house will still be once a day at 3 p.m., in addition to centralized clearing of banking and money industry checks, and will also collect checks from other financial institutions. The exchange amount is divided into national currency, clearing, and transfer amounts.</p>
<p>Wage Distribution</p>
<p>The China National Goods Production and Sales Association, China National Industries Association, National Goods Factory Union, and China Southwest Industry Association believe that the sixth item of the banking and money industry resolution states, "Depositors who distribute wages, if the amount is 500 yuan or more, may also refer to the previous method of stabilizing finance," which is different from the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram. A letter was sent by the city chamber of commerce for correction. Now, the city chamber of commerce has replied, stating that Article 5 of the Financial Stability Act states, "Deposits of companies, factories, shops, and agencies, for the purpose of paying wages or related to military affairs, and requiring the use of legal tender, may be handled separately." This means that</p>
<p>the earmarked balance</p>
<p>is not restricted by the Ma telegram. There is no discrepancy between them. The Hardware Industry Association believes that since August 21, 26, most of the merchant's deposits have been earmarked. Since the Ma telegram restriction, the earmarked deposit balance will inevitably become less and less, and clearing will become more and more frequent. Can the earmarked balance stored by the merchant be temporarily used as an equivalent overdraft for clearing, without the need to separate accounts and pay interest on both, so that the clearing from business income can be used to repay the overdraft for clearing at any time, and the daily legal tender can still be withdrawn within the earmarked amount in accordance with the Ma telegram, in order to adjust turnover. They have now sent a letter to the banking and money industries for consideration and reply.</p>
<p>Tax Payment Exempt from Restrictions</p>
<p>The Silk Factory Association believes that the factories operated by the industry in the interior will be shipped to Shanghai soon. After arriving at the port, a large amount of national tax must be paid, and legal tender must be paid. According to the Ma telegram restriction, the amount is far from the tax payable. Currently, all silk factories in this city are waiting for the orchid to arrive before opening the cocoonery. The customs side, according to the rules, will not allow the goods to be picked up before the tax is paid in full, let alone shipped to the factory for cocoonery. Therefore, a telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that tax payments be exempted from restrictions in order to maintain industry.</p>
<h3 id="e67">American Church School in Fuzhou Bombed; Formal Notification to Japanese Made; U.S. Consul-General in Shanghai Notifies in Writing, but Not as a Protest <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Mainland News reports that important buildings belonging to the Concord High School in Fuzhou, run by the American Methodist Episcopal Church, valued at US$35,000, were bombed with incendiary bombs by Japanese planes on Thursday evening, immediately catching fire and being completely destroyed. The U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai formally sent a document to the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday (30th) regarding this matter. According to U.S. Consulate staff, this negotiation was not conducted as a protest, as it is a matter for the State Department or the Embassy, but rather to notify the Japanese side that the U.S. authorities had received a report of the incident.</p>
<p>American-Made Maps Provided Earlier</p>
<p>It was learned yesterday that when the Japanese military began operations against Fuzhou and Wenzhou this week, the U.S. authorities had already provided the Japanese side with detailed maps showing American properties in the two areas, according to news received here.</p>
<p>Japanese Bomb Kills Two Children</p>
<p>A Japanese plane, taking off from a Japanese warship, dropped a bomb on the school, killing two Chinese children. It is believed that the two children were not students of the school, as the school's teachers and students had already evacuated when the Japanese military began its attack on Fuzhou. However, according to Mr. Fuller, the treasurer of the Shanghai Methodist Episcopal Church,</p>
<p>Church Representatives Remain at School</p>
<p>Church representatives Mr. and Mrs. Pillin remained at the school. It is possible they did not take refuge in the air raid shelter when the bomb fell. Mr. Pillin has been at the school for 25 years. The school is an agricultural school, established for over 30 years, exclusively for Chinese students. The school covers several acres, including an experimental farm. The destroyed buildings were the administration office and classrooms.</p>

<p>Ports along the Beisha shipping route are subjected to Japanese naval bombardment and harassment, creating an invisible blockade. Foreign ships navigating this route can barely reach Qinglong Port, and passenger and cargo traffic is scarce. Business has plummeted by over 80%, resulting in enormous losses. After the failure of the Japanese naval bombardment to cover a Japanese military landing attempt, the Chinese military authorities are actively preparing to launch a counterattack from land, having dispatched a portion of regular troops to join with guerilla forces, launching an assault from places like Yu Dong, Baochang, and Tangjia Town towards the Japanese and puppet forces' base at Maozhen and Sanchang in Yu Xi. A major battle appears imminent, hence the large number of people arriving in Shanghai from various parts of Tonghai yesterday to seek refuge.</p>

<p>The Dachang Airfield established by the Japanese is located about two li north of Dachang East Town. The aircraft stationed at the field are not military aircraft, but rather commercial airliners. When it was first established, it was named "Japan Air Transport Co., Ltd.", but it has now been renamed "China Air Transport Co., Ltd.". The area of the airfield is quite large, the exact acreage is unknown. The airfield has four runways for aircraft to take off and land, each 1,800 meters long and 200 meters wide. Previously, the surface was paved with coal ash, but because the coal ash flew up during takeoff and landing, it has been changed to a cement surface. There are often three aircraft at the airfield, which are quite large, each capable of carrying 24 passengers, with the tail capable of carrying two transport trucks worth of mail and luggage. Passengers traveling from the concessions to the airfield use public buses and two or three dedicated passenger pickup vehicles provided by the airfield. Postal trucks arrive at the airfield at around 7:00 am and 1:00 pm to pick up and deliver mail. Airplanes depart every morning at 8:15 am to places like Tokyo and Hankou, and return at around 5:00 pm in the afternoon, limited to twelve areas including Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, Liaoyang, and Tokyo, with Liaoyang being the furthest. In addition to Japanese officials and businessmen, there are often important figures from the Japanese puppet government, hence the frequent special curfews.</p>

<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that at 12:25 pm yesterday (12th), a member of the Japanese Special Service Department got out of his car on Lloyd Road and approached a Mr. Chen, the owner of a quarry in Songjiang, who was walking along Lloyd Road, asking Chen to get into the car to "discuss business". Mr. Chen cried for help, and two Chinese police officers who happened to be nearby rushed over, one of whom</p>
<p>Grabbed the Japanese Man Around the Waist</p>
<p>And escorted him to the Old Police Station, with the other Chinese police officer following behind, drawing his gun to prevent the Japanese man from escaping. The Criminal Division of the police station conducted a thorough interrogation, and the Japanese man stated who he was, after which he was released. The reporter inquired with personnel at the Police Department yesterday, but they refused to say a word. However, it was heard from</p>
<p>Reliable Sources</p>
<p>That someone from the other side had already discussed with Mr. Chen, persuading Chen to accept "cooperation" with the Japanese and operate his quarry in Songjiang. When the Japanese man approached him, suddenly asking him to get into the car to "discuss business", Chen, fearing he would be kidnapped, immediately cried for help. It was also heard that Mr. Chen had never met the Japanese man before. Chen was walking along Lloyd Road, and the Japanese man just happened to</p>
<p>Pass by at the Same Time</p>
<p>On the road, which seemed unlikely to be a coincidence. The Police Department has no jurisdiction over Japanese people, so the special service Japanese man was not searched. However, it is believed that the Japanese man was not carrying a weapon at the time.</p>

<p>Mainland News reports that Japanese shipping companies issued a notice yesterday (30th), stating that they are strictly implementing the new Japanese currency law, limiting the amount of cash that travelers can carry to Japan to a maximum of 200 Japanese yen. Amounts exceeding this must be carried in the form of letters of credit or drafts, in order to curb speculation in foreign exchange using Japanese yen. Speculators in Shanghai have been buying Japanese yen at low prices in recent months, transporting them to Japan and North China ports, where the value of the yen is higher than in Shanghai, reaping substantial profits. It is believed that there are two factors why the value of the Japanese yen has remained low, at 82 to 96 fen in legal tender, for many days: (1) it is impossible to use Japanese yen to purchase foreign exchange from Japanese or foreign banks; (2) an unprepared amount of Japanese currency flowed into the Shanghai market. According to the notice issued by Japanese shipping companies, travelers to Japan can purchase such letters of credit or drafts from Japanese banks in Shanghai, charging a fee of 1 to 4 fen per yuan for amounts under 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>A visitor from Chongming reported that the coastal dikes of Chongming have been in disrepair for years. Since the outbreak of war, the island has fallen into enemy hands. Last autumn, a typhoon caused a disaster, and the protective seawall was almost completely washed away, leaving only a line of remnant dike, which is very dangerous. In recent days, the southeast wind has been strong and the tides have been high. Many breaches occurred the night before last, and even the outer embankment recently repaired by farmers was damaged. Water poured in through the breaches, and the rivers within the city overflowed, causing flooding in the streets. In particular, the Japanese puppet personnel are extremely panicked, fearing that they will not last another day, and deeply worried that guerrillas will take the opportunity to attack, turning them into turtles in a jar. The Daziba section of the bus station has become a swamp, and there is a risk of flooding if the tidal waves rise again.</p>

<p>The monk Wan Yuan, also known as Wan Yuan, secular name Wei Tongchangyao, is 37 years old this year. He formerly served as abbot of the San Jiao Le Shan Temple on Rue du Pere Robert in the French Concession. After being attacked and removed from his position for selling temple property, he is currently the abbot of the Baiyun Convent at 707 Bailey Road. Although the monk appears to be a follower of Buddhism on the surface, he is naturally romantic and has sophisticated means. He often uses alms-collecting as an excuse to enter the homes of gentry and</p>
<p>Young Women</p>
<p>Engaging in dalliances. Numerous women have been deceived and exploited by him. Recently, Monk Wan Yuan had an affair with Sun Lanzhen (35 years old, from Gaoyou), a concubine of Yang Yunwu (46 years old this year, from Gaoyou), a wealthy real estate businessman residing at No. 3, Lane 44, Route Paul Beau, French Concession. Not content with frequent meetings in inns, he recently went a step further and incited Sun to take advantage of her husband Yang Yunwu's absence on May 28th to steal 2,275 yuan in cash, three gold bracelets, six gold rings, and twenty-two pairs of ivory chopsticks.</p>
<p>Eloping Behind Her Husband's Back</p>
<p>The two lived together like husband and wife in Room 428 of the Oriental Hotel on Avenue Chucheng. Wan Yuan entered and left the hotel dressed in secular clothing, so it was not easy for outsiders to detect their actions. After Yang discovered that his beloved concubine was missing, he reported it to the police and asked them to investigate. He also hired lawyer Liu Xiang to publish a warning about Sun in the newspaper. Sun, upon seeing the report, also hired lawyer Cai Zhihe to publish a rebuttal in the newspaper, launching a war of words. However, the police investigation revealed that Wan Yuan did not live in the Baiyun Convent and his whereabouts were unknown. It was not until the day before yesterday that the victim</p>
<p>Discovered Wan Yuan</p>
<p>Hiding in the Puti Temple on North Shansi Road. He immediately reported it to the French police, who dispatched detectives, accompanied by the public police, to rush to the Puti Temple. They only managed to arrest Monk Wan Yuan and confiscated a piece of embroidered pillowcase given to him by Sun, as well as newspaper clippings of the advertisements published by both Yang Yunwu and Sun Lanzhen. Unexpectedly, Wan Yuan's junior fellow monk, Wan Feng, upon seeing Wan Yuan being arrested, immediately fled out the back door and rushed to the Oriental Hotel to notify Sun to escape. By the time the detectives escorted Wan Yuan to the Oriental Hotel, Sun had already received the news and fled, making it impossible to arrest her. The detectives then took Wan Yuan, along with the evidence, back to the French police station and</p>
<p>Detained him</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer of the French Concession administrative authorities, explained the case and requested that the defendant be detained and a further investigation be conducted to apprehend Sun, who was still at large, for prosecution. The plaintiff, Yang Yunwu, arrived at the court with his attorney Liu Xiang. After questioning by Judge Qiu Huanying, the defendant Wan Yuan firmly denied having committed adultery with Sun and inciting her to elope. When questioned about the source of the confiscated evidence, the defendant was speechless. The court then ordered a rescheduled hearing for 8:00 AM on the 6th, and the defendant was taken into custody.</p>

The injured Xu Xiuying and Zhang Yongtian were treated in different hospitals. During the postponement, Zhang Yongtian's injured shoulders and arms were treated by a doctor and he was no longer in danger, but Xu Xiuying suffered severe axe wounds to her arms and back</p>
<p>Bone Fracture</p>
<p>And died at Guangren Hospital at 1:15 pm on the 19th of this month. The coroner at the Jiaozhou Road morgue, dispatched by the court, confirmed that Xu Xiuying died from axe wounds to her arms and back. Yesterday, the police re-sent Li Genyin to the Third Criminal Division. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that, after investigation, Xu Xiuying and</p>
<p>The Defendant</p>
<p>Were not a formally married couple. According to him, they were merely lovers who had been together for two years. He should not have used such a vicious method to deliberately chop her to death. He requested severe punishment. Zhang Yongtian, who had recovered from his injuries, testified that he and Xu Xiuying were passing through Tiantong Road after leaving the Haihualou restaurant on Haining Road in a rickshaw, intending to return to</p>
<p>Hongkou</p>
<p>When the defendant suddenly rushed from behind and chopped them with an axe. Questioned by the judge, the defendant Li Genyin admitted that he and Xu Xiuying were not formally married. After she and Zhang Yongtian became lovers and lived together in Hongkou, she rarely returned home. He became angry and resorted to this extreme measure. He begged for leniency. Judge Huang Risheng ordered that he remain in custody and scheduled sentencing for July 6th.</p>

<p>A certain Japanese giant military barge (originally named in Japanese) carrying a large quantity of munitions to Shanghai berthed at the Beizhan Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Hongkou and began unloading yesterday. At 11:00 am yesterday, a large bomber was being lifted from the middle cabin. Halfway through the lift, the hook could not bear the weight and suddenly broke, causing the aircraft to instantly fall into the cabin. Suddenly, smoke began and fire erupted. The Japanese soldiers were terrified and immediately used fire extinguishers to put out the fire, but in an instant the plane was completely destroyed, leaving only the wreckage. Further attempts were made to lift the remains, but they were useless. However, a large amount of gasoline was stored in the ship. It is unknown whether it caught fire at the time, and whether any workers in the cabin were killed or injured. According to the News Agency, a special Japanese ship, the Shirayuki Maru, transported a large quantity of military supplies from Japan to Shanghai on the 27th of last month and immediately docked at the Beizhan Wharf on the Huangpu River. Yesterday morning, the ship was originally scheduled to leave the Huangpu River. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in the cabin around 7:00 AM. The fire was extinguished by fireboats dispatched by the Customs, and was extinguished at around 8:00 AM.</p>

<p>Pang Qingbao, a restaurant worker from Nanjing at No. 490 Zhejiang Road, owner of Xiaoleyi Restaurant, and his wife Cao Fuzhen, have always had a poor relationship. Cao had previously accused her husband of abandonment at the Liuhe County Government, and had also exposed her husband's adultery, and at the same time slapped her husband's friend Lu Zhichen several times, which worsened their relationship, making them as incompatible as ice and charcoal. On November 19th of last year, Pang suddenly reported to the Laoza Police Station, accusing his wife of committing adultery with Lu Zhichen and being in</p>
<p>A Secret Meeting in a Room</p>
<p>At Room 320 of the Far Eastern Hotel. Detectives were dispatched and indeed caught Cao and Lu Zhichen in the room. They were sent to the Special No. 1 Court, where they were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment and allowed to commute the sentence by paying a fine. Cao refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After detailed trial by the High Court, it was discovered that this case was actually a set-up by Pang Qingbao to falsely accuse his wife of infidelity in order to achieve other purposes. The original sentence was revoked and Cao was declared innocent. The prosecutor's office of the Special No. 1 Court believed that Pang and Lu Zhichen had conspired to falsely accuse a weak woman of infidelity in order to frame her. If they were not severely punished, it would not</p>
<p>Serve as a Warning</p>
<p>So prosecutor Song Genshan investigated Pang Qingbao and Lu Zhichen and prosecuted them for false accusation in the same-level criminal court. The part of the case against Lu Zhichen was suspended because Lu could not be found despite repeated summons. The trial of Pang Qingbao's part of the case was concluded, and he was ordered to provide bail and await a ruling. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Peishen opened the Second Criminal Division and sentenced Pang Qingbao to four months of imprisonment for false accusation. During the appeal period, he was allowed to be released on his original bail and exempt from detention.</p>

<p>Lawyer Hong Zhao from Chongming County in this city had an affair with Shen Yao Ying, leading to lawsuits for theft and defamation.

She went to the residence on Weihaiwei Road, intending to work for her again. Shen Yao Ying, seeing that it was her wet nurse, recounted her experiences, expressing her feelings in her words and appearance. It happened to be noticed by Gong Jian Qiu, Gong Hong Zhao's father, who saw Yao Ying's wet nurse coming for no reason. He called the street police and had the woman taken to the Chengdu Road police station. After questioning, the police station found Gong Jian Qiu's actions unreasonable and released the woman.</p>

Before leaving, he told his companions that he was going fishing. Unexpectedly, he never returned. Until yesterday morning, the factory, seeing that he had not returned all night, reported to the military police and the Marine Corps, requesting an investigation. They sent people out to search everywhere. The Japanese military police found Hirose's body in the grass near a small river in Gu Jia Ku, one thousand meters away from the Great Field. The body had wounds, including one on the right ear, three on the back, and one each on the neck, chest, and wrist. The wounds were not caused by a knife.

<p>Last year, due to the joint attention of the two concession authorities and people from all walks of life to epidemic prevention, summer diseases were spared from spreading. However, the crowded situation in the epidemic hospitals last year has shown that the existing epidemic hospitals in Shanghai are not enough to meet the needs during this period of population concentration. It is heard that charitable circles are very concerned about this. If funds permit and there is a suitable hospital site, a separate refugee epidemic hospital will be established.</p>
<p>Voluntary First Aid at Zhenxin Hospital</p>
<p>The Zhenxin Temporary Plague Hospital at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Tianjin Road was established by the Zhenxin Charity Association last year.

<h3 id="e96">Japanese Obstruct Spring Cocoon Transport to Shanghai Silk Factories Cannot Start Up Only Jardine Matheson and Four Other Companies Barely Started Japanese Attempt to Monopolize Conditions are Extremely Harsh <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>After the war, silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang refused to cooperate with the Japanese and opened new factories in the Shanghai concession areas. There are more than thirty that have been completed. They originally planned to start operations one after another after the spring cocoons came on the market. However, because the cocoons collected from the occupied areas were blocked from being transported to Shanghai by the "Central China Silk Company," the factories in the concession area could not start operations. At the same time, the existing cocoon stocks in various factories have also been exhausted, forcing them to shut down. Only Jardine Matheson and four other companies are barely maintaining operations until the end of June. Although the merchants have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese on the issue of transporting spring cocoons to Shanghai, there have been no results due to the harsh conditions. Tens of thousands of workers have therefore lost their jobs. It is heard that the conditions of the "Central China Company" are that half of the cocoons collected by each factory must be given to the company, and the profits obtained must also be shared with the company.</p>

The girl was young and confused, and was defiled in his quarters, induced to lose her virginity, and raped continuously, resulting in pregnancy. Recently, for the past month, Wang, fearing exposure, disappeared and did not come to the Zheng's house to teach opera. The girl's abdomen has recently become larger, and was discovered by her mother, who questioned her and learned the truth. Shocked, she reported the matter to the French police station with her daughter the day before yesterday. Police officers were dispatched to No. 4 Yiru Li, Tiantong Road, and Wang Pei Zhi was arrested and brought back to the French police station for interrogation, pending transfer to the court for questioning.</p>

<p>— Fang Zichuan</p>
<p>Medicine is related to the people's livelihood, and the establishment of hospitals is even more closely related to public health. In countries that implement a public medical system, medical affairs are managed by the government to ensure the health of all citizens. Whether in urban or rural areas, the distribution of hospitals is proportional to the local population to meet needs. Even in advanced countries that have not implemented a public medical system, medical affairs are mostly controlled and adjusted by the government. For example, the city of Boston in the United States, with a population of over one million, has 3,000 beds in its municipal hospitals. In addition to free treatment, it also provides serums, vaccines, and other commonly used medicines to relieve the suffering of citizens. Furthermore, other private hospitals, whether aristocratic or charitable, all cooperate with each other to benefit patients. Looking back at our country, due to the backwardness of medical education, there is an insufficient supply of medical personnel, and the establishment of the Ministry of Health was late. In recent years, although public medicine has been advocated by the government, people still mostly seek treatment from private hospitals and practicing pharmacists. Where there is profit, people flock to it. Thus, the establishment of hospitals and the practice of doctors are based on individual income, regardless of the needs of the working masses. Where the wealthy are, the medical field is prosperous. The whole country is developing in a distorted manner, and medical affairs are gradually becoming less related to the people, leading to each acting independently, and the system collapsing. Taking this city as an example, the population of citizens and foreigners exceeds three million, but the total number of beds in normal times is less than 5,000. After graduating, doctors compete to practice medicine, and hospital facilities are in short supply. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident in the 26th year, the medical problems of wounded soldiers, civilians, and refugees have suddenly become acute. In addition, people from other areas have come to Shanghai to escape the war, and the population has nearly doubled in two years. The public medical problem is particularly important. The original hospitals in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Hongkou have been closed due to the war. The existing hospitals have expanded greatly. Those that have been closed, such as the Municipal Hospital in the city center, the Public Shanghai Hospital, the Zhabei Infectious Disease Hospital, the Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge, the Sacred Heart Hospital in Yangshupu, the Puci Hospital in Minhang, and the Chengzhong Hospital in Jiangwan, either have a large scale or a long history, and all have considerable status in the medical field. Those that have moved to the concessions, such as the Tongren Hospital in Hongkou, the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, the Hongqiao Sanatorium, the Shanghai Health Sanatorium on Robegen Road, the Southeast Hospital of the Shanghai Army Camp, and the Zhonghua Leprosy Sanatorium in Dachang, have either expanded in new locations or reduced their scope to maintain the status quo. The vicissitudes of life and changes are manifold. The reporter will visit them separately to clarify the truth. The hospitals originally in the concessions have also expanded their beds and hired more doctors to cope with the extraordinary needs. In addition, many new hospitals have been established in the concessions, either with social funding or private operation. General hospitals such as Dagong and Darui, and specialized hospitals such as tuberculosis hospitals, children's hospitals, and obstetrics hospitals, etc., are numerous. Therefore, the complexity of the medical situation in this city is the greatest today. During the intense warfare, the rescue of wounded soldiers and civilians was naturally the primary task. People from all walks of life organized the Shanghai Rescue Committee to be responsible for handling rescue matters, which ended after the National Army moved west. Subsequently, the medical affairs of refugees were handled by the Chinese Red Cross International Committee and the Shanghai Charity Federation, and then transferred to the Red Cross Society of China in November of the 27th year. This is a general overview of the major hospital dynamics in this city in the past two years.</p>
<p>According to the late famous doctor, the American Su Mai'er, the standard of a hospital should be judged by the following five things: (1) organization, (2) equipment, (3) facilities, (4) medical staff, (5) funding, (6) scientific work, (7) future plans. If this is used as a criterion for measurement, although the number of hospitals in this city is undoubtedly several dozen, there are still many points that can be discussed. The reporter drafted this article in a very short period of time, and it is difficult to be thorough. Glimpses of a part and regrets of omissions are inevitable. It is hoped that the medical colleagues in this city will understand.</p>
<p>The hospitals listed in this article are limited to those visited by the reporter. In addition, the large-scale hospitals in the concessions of this city, such as the Hong'en and Gongji Hospitals established by foreigners, have made very little contribution to our country's patients, so they are not discussed. Furthermore, the Russian Orthodox Confraternity Thosptial, established by Russian expatriates, has also been reported to accept refugees from our country, which is very touching, but unfortunately it has not been visited. In addition, hospitals established by Chinese, such as the Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital, the Huilv Hospital (now changed to a refugee hospital), the Tiren Hospital (established by the church), the Yihe Hospital, etc., as well as the clinics attached to practicing physicians with hospital characteristics, such as the sanatorium of Dr. Wang Qizhang, the Fuyou Hospital of Dr. Gao Jinglang, the maternity hospital of Dr. Wang Yihui, the Bethel Hospital of Dr. Shi Meiyu, the obstetrics hospital of Dr. Sun Keji, the Shengsheng Hospital of Dr. Qu Shaoheng, and the clinic of Dr. Qu Zhifu, and the Da Shanghai Sanatorium of Dr. Diao Xinde, all enjoy considerable reputation in society. People from all walks of life are very familiar with them and do not need introduction. The reporter did not have time to pay a visit due to time constraints and can only apologize here. The general situation of the hospitals in this city is described below:</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Situation of Shanghai Steam Boilers <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zhixuan</p>
<p>A boiler is also called a furnace. In general, people who do not have a close working relationship with boilers do not understand the detailed situation of boilers. Even those who know a little think that its use is limited to factories, so they only ask whether the boiler chimney is smoking to see if the factory is busy. Since the Republic of China's 18th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd years, there have been many factory boiler explosions in Shanghai, but the accidents only occurred inside the factories, so they were not very noticed by the public. Later, a boiler explosion in a private prostitute brothel in the French Concession killed many people. Soon after, the boiler that burned heating gas in a large Shanghai bank injured people due to an explosion. Shanghai had a few more understandings of boilers. However, there are still many people who use boilers who are ignorant and blindly follow, but there are also many people who are oversensitive and suspicious. Therefore, I offer my humble opinion for readers to refer to. When dealing with boilers, one must not be negligent, nor should one stop eating because of choking.</p>
<p>There are many types of boilers, most of which are made of metal. Some use pig iron, but most are made of iron plates, steel plates, and steel pipes. They are roughly divided into vertical (firecracker), horizontal fire-tube, and water-tube types. Furthermore, due to different uses, they are divided into land type, ship type, and locomotive type, but the principle is the same. Water is heated and boiled into steam. Theoretically speaking, one cubic foot box (assumed to be one cubic foot) of water, after being boiled into steam, can expand to a large volume of up to one thousand six hundred and five cubic foot boxes under the same atmospheric pressure. In other words, if one cubic foot of water is placed in a tool with a volume of only two hundred and thirty-two cubic feet that is solid and sealed on all sides and burned, a large expansion force will be generated inside after it becomes steam. This expansion force is due to the steam wanting to expand from two hundred and thirty-two cubic feet to one thousand six hundred and five cubic feet. At that time, the expansion force is one hundred pounds on each square foot of the surface, which is called one hundred pounds of steam pressure, or one hundred pounds of "water-ting" in common parlance. If the volume is enlarged, it is reduced to fifty pounds, and if the volume is reduced, it is increased to two hundred pounds in an inverse proportion. A boiler is a steel container in which water is placed and burned with fire to turn it into steam. In ordinary boilers, the water volume is about 7/10, while the steam volume is only about 3/10. Therefore, the steam pressure in the boiler can be increased as much as possible as long as the external firepower continues to increase, turning water into steam. The explosion of the boiler occurs when the pressure rises to the point where the steel cannot handle it. The reason why bombs can explode is that the explosives are sealed in the bomb and expand when ignited, expanding until the shell cannot handle it, and then it explodes. In short, boilers, air conditioning cylinders, and other storage bottles for oxygen, light gas, ammonia, etc., as small as soda or oil bottles, have the same risk of explosion as bombs. More than ten years ago, when the author was in Jilin, a servant put a can of canned beef on the stove, which exploded after a long time. Also, the young son of a certain family in Tianjin threw a can of flower-branded sweetened milk into the stove and injured the maid. The principle of the two explosions is no different from the explosion of a boiler. To prevent boiler explosions, each boiler is equipped with a safety steam valve. When the pressure is high, it can automatically open to allow steam to escape, so as to avoid danger. However, most safety steam valves are poorly manufactured and often leak steam for no reason. The person in charge, therefore, tries to block the pressure, which is tantamount to the door bolt of Taiping Gate being faulty and blocking it instead. Although there is a door, it is equal to a facade, which is very dangerous. In addition, drying cloths and materials on the boiler or around the chimney is not only a safety hazard, but also a fire hazard. It is even more inappropriate to have the four walls of the boiler room covered with bunks as workers' bedrooms. What is even worse is that the owner of a sock factory allows the postpartum woman of his newborn baby to recuperate on the mezzanine of a boiler room, although he says that it can save the cost of stoves and coal. He does not think that the boiler is dangerous, and the rising and flying of soot also has a great impact on hygiene. This kind of action should be prohibited for those who have a direct relationship.</p>
<p>There are two uses for the steam boiled by the boiler: one is to use its force, that is, to drive a steam engine or transform it into electricity, and then use it to transform into various jobs; the other is to use its heat. In addition to using it for heating in winter, the manufacture of chemicals, medicines, food, clothing, and daily necessities all use steam to generate heat. In today's world, even the old monks sitting in deep mountain huts are directly or indirectly closely related to steam.</p>
<p>The height of the steam pressure is very important for those who use its force, but for those who use its heat, the size of the steam pressure does not make much difference. However, if the installation is simple and the steam pipes are small, the pressure cannot be applied when it is low, so the pressure must be increased to compensate for the poor transportation in the simple pipes. On the one hand, seeking cheap boiler prices, and therefore cutting corners and reducing materials, on the other hand, trying to increase pressure, running in the opposite direction is the most common mistake of general factory owners in Shanghai today. Chinese people often have dull stomachs and weak bodies because they do not exercise. The only method they consider appropriate for nourishment is to fill themselves with greasy tonic products, which makes the stomach even more congested. Their opposing measures that do not understand the principle are the same, and the prejudices are so deep that they die without realizing it. In fact, in order to reduce costs, there is gold in the smoke in the chimney and the heat in the waste water. As long as there is a proper method, it is impossible to recover and reuse it without having to bear great risks and seek high pressure.</p>
<p>The reason why a boiler can boil steam is entirely due to the heat of the fuel used. There are many types of fuel, such as diesel, coal, wood, cottonseed hulls, chaff, etc. Anything that can burn can be used as fuel for a boiler. To select boiler fuel: first, it is necessary to seek out the components that contain boiler-damaging components, such as sulfur, that should not be too many; second, it is necessary to seek out the cheaper price in proportion, because the size of the boiler is determined by the amount of steam it can boil per hour, so the fuel used must be calculated in money, and it must be ensured that it consumes the least amount of money and boils the largest amount of steam. Boiler fuel economy is mostly due to the suitability of the fuel, but it is also related to the structure of the boiler itself and its equipment. Among all the boilers in Shanghai, 70% of them are simple and crude. Not only is safety a concern, but fuel is also wasted. If you want to compete with others in industry, saving fuel is also an urgent matter.</p>
<p>Boiler boiling steam is a continuous process, that is, when the steam is used up, new water must be added to the furnace to boil it, so the work does not stop. It is also often heard that boilers are burned out and have accidents due to lack of water. The water used must not only be filtered to remove mud and sand, but also cannot contain too many hard minerals. The water in rivers and lakes has a lower hardness, while the water in wells and springs has a higher hardness. Dirty or too hard furnace water is prone to produce water foil. This kind of water foil not only prevents heat transfer and wastes fuel, but also damages the steel and corrodes the inside of the boiler. Air is an indispensable thing for human life, but the air contained in furnace water has the disadvantage of corroding the boiler. Oils and acids are even more taboo in furnace water. The relationship between furnace water and safety and economy is no less than that of fuel.</p>
<p>Before August 13th in Shanghai, according to the author's investigation, the total number of boilers with a pressure of more than 30 pounds used in industry was about 500 within the boundaries of Special District One; about 100 within the boundaries of Special District Two; and about 300 in Zhabei, Nanshi, Pudong, and the off-boundary roads in Huxi; the total number of boilers in the city, plus missed surveys—such as inns and bathrooms—was about 1,000 including boilers. According to the author's estimation, the number in the 10th year of the Republic of China was about 330, and the number in the 20th year of the Republic of China was about 650, an increase of 320 in 10 years, and 1,000 in the 26th year of the Republic of China. Among them, more than 60% of the boilers were made locally. The materials used, the manufacturing methods, the appropriate pressure, and the safety devices were mostly not reviewed by qualified technicians, and there were even fewer people with knowledge, experience, and wealth who were responsible for management and operation.

<h3 id="e133">Yarn and Cotton: Exchange Rate Tightening and Cash Contraction; Yarn Market Fluctuation; The Trend is Still Rising <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Since the tightening of foreign exchange, the spot cotton yarn market has seen a general desire among wealthy merchants to recoup losses from currency devaluation through commodity prices, leading to a search for cotton yarn that has caused new peaks to emerge. On June 20, 20-count Special Jincheng reached 520 yuan, and 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods twice reached 510 yuan, more than 5 yuan higher than the peak price on October 1 of the previous year. The multi-party was elated, and it was said that according to the chart route, further speculation would lead to special prices. As a result, the buying frenzy was unprecedented. Unexpectedly, on the 21st, the Ministry of Finance's telegram arrived in Shanghai, restricting cash withdrawals, like a bolt from the blue. The market fell into despair, and on the 22nd and 23rd, the market was suspended for one day. On the 24th, it was deemed inappropriate to suspend the market for so long, and it was not beneficial to the industry. A meeting was convened, but there was no result. However, due to the continuous demand from sporadic Guangdong merchants, the dark market began operating on the 24th. The market was quite bleak. Due to the sluggish financial situation and the Japanese landing in Shantou, the six-month settlement at the end of June was approaching, and the credit situation tightened. Redemption was also urged for overdue mortgages. Many scattered investors were subject to environmental control and were unloading in the market. Therefore, the market price fell straight to 480 yuan for 20-count Special Jincheng and 473 yuan for Double Horse on the 28th, which was 40 yuan lower for Special Jincheng and 37 yuan lower for Double Horse than the high price on the 10th. On the 29th, the upward trend suddenly rose, saying that the foreign exchange had softened again and the gold had turned higher. Some bulls in the securities industry and the exchange rose up to drag in, jumping 20 yuan in one day. On the 30th, the market situation remained tense, and there was a lot of discussion. It was said that once the six-month account was settled, the market would open on July 4, and the silver and money industry would have 500,000 yuan in new chips for exchange circulation in the market, which would definitely benefit the multi-party. Some people also said that it is currently difficult to settle foreign cotton, and there are concerns about the raw material problems of the yarn mills in the future, which may lead to a reduction in working hours. The buying intentions were even stronger. All these good reasons made the yarn market optimistic, so it closed at a high price. The price of 20-count Special Jincheng yarn was 503 yuan, an increase of 23 yuan from the low price on the 28th. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 498 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan. Judging from the enthusiastic atmosphere in the yarn market, it is still unlikely to fall sharply. However, recently, the Meikou blockade has restrained transportation, making the outlet more difficult. Secondly, the small-scale cloth factories in this port are affected by the narrow sales channels, and the dyed goods cannot avoid being piled up and hoarded. There have been proposals to reduce working hours. The amount of yarn and cloth stored in each warehouse is also not small.</p>
<h3 id="e134">No Trading in Spot Yarn and Cotton <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn: Due to the half-year end and the closing of business on all sides, there has been no dark market trading in cotton yarn after inquiring around. The policy must be determined after the opening of the silver and money industry on July 4.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton: There is absolutely no trading, and the source from Northern Jiangsu has also been interrupted. Only Bao Quanwu said.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Cost Calculation of 32-count Single Yarn <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Earlier, the price of 32-count single yarn in the cotton yarn market was extremely sharp, reaching about 660 yuan. Why did it reach this point? Because most of the spindles were used for 20-count yarn, the 32-count single fine yarn spindles accounted for about two-fifths of the total number of spindles, that is, 50,000 fine yarn spindles, of which about 20,000 were used for spinning 32-count yarn (or this approximate number was increased after changing gears due to the urgent need for expensive yarn). Each spindle pulls an average output (32-count yarn) of 0.65 pounds, and the daily output of yarn is 13,000 pounds. Calculated by the weight of 420 pounds per piece, about 30 pieces of yarn are produced. Because customers in Sichuan, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, and other regions have inherent needs, and the raw materials for high-quality undershirts in this city are mostly 32-count single fine yarn, the demand for 20-count yarn is weak and the price falls, while 32-count yarn goes the opposite way and rises sharply. As for the cost of 32-count yarn, the price of secondary American cotton (7/8 secondary Meetling) and Tongzhou cotton is at most about 100 yuan per dan. Calculated at 350 jin of cotton used, the cotton cost is 350 yuan, plus wages, materials, electricity, management, finance (interest), and other expenses of about 70 yuan, the total cost of each piece of 32-count yarn is only 420 yuan. Selling it for 662 yuan, you can purely earn as much as 245 yuan per piece. However, the profit is too high, so after the crazy rise in early June, it has returned to silence. Now that the cash problem has arrived, there has been no market to speak of in the past week. Compared with the excitement at the beginning, it feels even more deserted. (Long Jusheng)</p>

<p>Due to the holiday, there was no dark market in cash Haxia. However, it is rumored that the informal price outside the market has approached the 2,600 yuan mark, which is slightly stronger than the previous day. Due to the wait-and-see attitude of sellers, no transactions were made.</p>

<p>London, 30th: Silver market speculators sold, and a few Indian buyers bought near-term. The market was still flat. After the close, it was flat and hard. India quoted zero six two five higher than the listed price, but the sellers still had no intention of supplying. The near-term of large bars of silver rebounded zero six two five, and the far-term continued to narrow zero six two five. Also, New York reported that American spot prices did not change, and Mumbai reported that the Indian silver market was strengthening. Spot prices rebounded by 10 annas, July rebounded by 13 annas, August rebounded by 11 annas, and the rear end of the leg area was soft. The total number of transactions was 75.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Market After Foreign Exchange Contraction <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>Since the "Preparation" Bank and "Huaxing" Bank, supported by the Japanese puppets, issued counterfeit currency to absorb legal tender and obtain foreign exchange, and on the other hand, the surge in Japanese goods imports also drains our foreign exchange, without any prevention, it will be endless. The Exchange Equalization Fund Committee adopted an emergency measure, temporarily suspending the supply of foreign exchange. For example, the British exchange rate dropped from eight and a quarter to six and a half, and the US exchange rate fell similarly. The overall impact has devalued the legal tender by no less than 20%, and the foreign exchange to be obtained is only about 80% of the previous amount. Conversely, our preparation fund is consolidated. Due to the high foreign exchange rate, imports are reduced, and the amount of gold payment is decreasing daily. Therefore, a high foreign exchange rate is beneficial to our wartime economy.</p>
<p>With high foreign exchange rates, our export industry benefits greatly. The cost of imported goods increases, making sales difficult, while domestic goods can be sold smoothly without obstruction. Raw material exports, converted into foreign exchange, are very low, making foreign sales more profitable, and international trade can turn into a better situation. Necessary imports such as chemical raw materials and machinery are still supplied by the Central Bank at the statutory exchange rate, while the exchange rate on the black market is incomparably high. Residents in the concessions are inevitably affected by the high prices, but for the sake of national survival and national liberation, even if the path is full of thorns, we will walk on it as if it were flat ground.</p>
<p>There is a correlation between high foreign exchange rates and rising prices. However, there are also those whose costs have not increased, such as manufacturing costs, but as soon as the exchange rate changes, price increases are announced. Is it that the goods in factories and shops have never settled foreign exchange before? This is doubtful. Domestic goods that are unrelated to foreign exchange also take this opportunity to raise prices, which is incomprehensible. The goods with price increases include Chinese and Western medicines, hardware, photography, silk weaving, enamel factories, leather factories, and handicrafts, as well as more than 50 kinds of items such as water bottles, gasoline, beer, canned goods, and fountain pens. The number of items whose price increases have not yet been reported in the newspapers is countless. With a little research, it can be known that few of the items with price increases should have increased, and most are virtual increases without reason. For example, the hardware industry had abundant stocks before the war, but now factories have been destroyed and demand is sluggish. The industry has increased prices by 20-30%, directly treating inventory as foreign exchange. Daily necessities such as coal balls, made of white coal dust and yellow mud from North China, were previously sold at about 31 yuan per ton. The price has increased three times in ten days, reaching 36 yuan. Mosquito coils made from pyrethrum are also unrelated to foreign exchange, but have also increased by about 10%. Even for items related to foreign exchange, as soon as the exchange rate contracted the previous day, the price increased by 20-30% the next day, which is no different from highway robbery by bandits.</p>
<p>Issuing counterfeit currency to obtain legal tender, and then using smuggled goods to obtain foreign exchange, even if the exchange rate shrinks to 5 or 4, they will still take it endlessly. Therefore, the supply of foreign exchange should be restricted, the legal tender in the occupied areas should be reduced to the minimum, and domestic debt principal and interest should be allocated for exchange remittance. Bill discounting should be strictly investigated, and the inventory of silver and money businesses should also be reduced to block the channels for obtaining foreign exchange with legal tender. On the one hand, the national bank should effectively manage foreign exchange, and when there is a need, the usage should be reviewed, and those that are unnecessary or improper should be banned. As for those who use their special status to be free from government orders, engage in absorbing deposits, buying and selling raw gold, silver and foreign exchange, they are actually a source of capital flight and a shortcut for foreign exchange leakage, and negotiations should be conducted with all parties to ban them.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Silk and Tea: Little Excitement in the Silk Market <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Recently, both domestic and foreign silk markets have lacked vitality, causing exports from this port to also stagnate. This is because import and export firms are temporarily watching the price changes as it is the time for semi-annual settlements, while manufacturers are hoping for the arrival of dried orchids from the mainland to Shanghai, so they have also stopped trading. Yesterday, Yokohama silk spot prices rose by 5 yuan, and forward prices rose by 18 yuan. New York spot prices were sold on the original board, with recent prices rising by 4 cents and forward prices rising by 3 cents, but silk transactions in New York were also very few.</p>
<p>The silk market in this port has faced difficulties due to exchange rates and obstructed raw materials, making it difficult for silk prices to decline. However, due to sluggish exports, its own shipments, and the possibility of production suspension due to the lack of dried orchids, the silk market is not exciting. Therefore, recently, some transaction firm quotes have been inconsistent. This point must wait until the release of orchids is scheduled to resume normal operations. Today and tomorrow, foreign firms are closing for settlements, and the same is true overseas, waiting for the market to open on July 4th.</p>

<p>According to London telegraphs yesterday, the sugar market saw a recent drop of two and a half points, with August at eight shillings and three and a half points, with no changes in forward prices. However, the association in this city continued to see upward expansion, with 24 coarse white rising by 20 cents, 30 yuan at this shop, 29 yuan and 80 cents at other shops, 22 yuan for transit goods, 300 bags, and 21 yuan and 60 cents for customs goods, 200 bags. Taikoo chariot white also rose by 30 cents, with West Shop B mark at 30 yuan, 200 bags, CW mark at 29 yuan and 80 cents, CX mark at 29 yuan and 30 cents, DY mark at 28 yuan and 80 cents, HX mark at 28 yuan and 50 cents, H mark chariot red rising by 10 cents, at 19 yuan and 50 cents, transit Dutch red at 15 yuan, 200 bags, and this factory's ice sugar rising by one yuan, with No. 1 ice at 35 yuan and 50 cents, and crystal clear ice at 37 yuan. For national sugar, the Chao gang opened up more than 180 bags of Chongti Qing, priced at 18 yuan.</p>

<p>The arrival of Sichuan pickled mustard greens has decreased recently, but the appetite from all sides is more active, so the market situation has tightened. It is found that the previous market sold for 16 or 17 yuan, but yesterday's firm quotes were already calling for 50 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, the source of Galangal has been cut off due to the fall of Youtou, and the stock of registered goods is also limited, so the trend is firm. The current market quote is 35 yuan. It is heard that one lot was opened yesterday, with the price being 33 yuan, which is one or two yuan higher than before.</p>

<p>The supply of Beihai goods of star anise and aniseed has been cut off for a long time. If purchasing from Hong Kong, it is difficult to align due to exchange rate relations. Therefore, although sales have seemed sluggish recently, those with goods in hand generally hold optimistic views. For example, the current quote is 105 yuan. It is found that the previous market opened at more than 80 yuan, but in fact, it has secretly risen by 20 yuan.</p>

It is found that the previous market price for Yantai Longxudao shrimp tails, which was 129 yuan and 50 cents, is now sold for 142 yuan and 50 cents, all of which are exchange remittances.

<p>Since entering the moldy season, the transaction of Fujian fragrant mushrooms has been quiet. However, recently the Hong Kong gang suddenly came out to search for purchases. Yesterday, a batch of cold air goods was opened, with the transaction price being 275 yuan. It is found that the previous market price for this product was 250 yuan, and now it has risen by a significant amount of 25 yuan.</p>

<p>The Weiss iron trade has always been most extensive among toy factories, can factories, tin printing factories, cigarette factories, etc. in this street. In addition, among guest gangs, the Tianjin gang is the most active. However, it is heard that recently, this port is facing a cash problem that has not been resolved, and Tianjin is also in a period of blockade. Therefore, it can be said that there is no movement from guest gangs, and there are only sporadic movements in this street. Therefore, the future seems unlikely to improve. However, the market conditions have actually flourished due to environmental factors. For example, old steel factory goods are sold at 72 yuan per box, new steel factory goods at 70 yuan, wild chicken goods at 68 yuan, and high-quality packed goods require 68 yuan, while lower-quality goods are quoted at 65 yuan, all of which are more than ten yuan higher than before.</p>

<p>Woolen fabrics of all kinds have risen in unison, with the most significant increase in Western-style suits. Next are Chinese-style clothing materials and summer white goods. Economically affluent shops are currently willing to wait temporarily for actual sales to start and sell at good prices.

The current increase is only about 10%.</p>

<h3 id="e149">A Glimpse of Soaring Prices in the Past Six Months <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The price of goods in Shanghai has been rising in a straight line in the past six months, creating an unprecedented phenomenon of "price increases for everything", giving the people living in Shanghai a great blow and burden. Although the rise in prices during wartime is an inevitable result, it is important to recognize clearly that many of the price increases in Shanghai are abnormal, exceptional, and unnatural, especially the soaring prices of various goods in June, which are even more unreasonable. Due to the tightening of the black market foreign exchange, which is neither the stimulation of currency inflation nor the imbalance of supply and demand in the market, regardless of whether they are foreign goods or not, without waiting for the arrival of new goods, they immediately and immediately raised the prices of existing goods, which is clearly unrelated to the current foreign exchange contraction. It is obviously speculative manipulation, trying to make a fortune from the national crisis and deprive the public of their livelihood. In order to understand the actual situation of price increases in the past six months, apart from the fact that the market prices of original products naturally vary sooner or later, here, only the statistics of price increases published in newspapers by various industries amount to 203 cases. Except for the 11 cases of re-price increases, the net total is 192 cases, that is, 192 units of industries and factories that have increased prices. Compared with the total number of price increases throughout last year, there is an increase of 44 cases, which indicates that the trend of price increases in the past six months has become acute. Comparing the 203 price increases in each month, June has the most with 138 cases, accounting for more than 66% of the number of price increases. This is clear evidence that general merchants are hoarding and speculating in June after the black market foreign exchange once contracted. Next is March with 19 cases, April with 17 cases, May with 14 cases, February with 10 cases, and the lowest is January with 5 cases. The reason is that in these five months, the black market foreign exchange was very stable, with few fluctuations, so that unscrupulous merchants had no excuse to raise prices, and of course, domestic goods had no room to follow.</p>
<p>Furthermore, analyzing the 203 price increases by commodity type, there are 16 categories: food and beverage, clothing, daily necessities, medicine, decoration, electrical appliances, dyeing and weaving, civil engineering, fuel, candle foil, metal, culture, raw materials, transportation, packaging, and cleaning. Comparing the types of goods, food and beverage ranks first with 20 types, daily necessities ranks second with 16 types, decorations and metal products rank third with 12 types each, cultural products and clothing rank fourth with 10 types each, medicine and transportation rank fifth with 7 types each, electrical appliances and dyeing and weaving rank sixth with 6 types each, packaging ranks seventh with 5 types, fuel and raw materials rank eighth with 3 types each, civil engineering and candle foil rank ninth with 2 types each, and cleaning ranks last with 1 type. Here, we can see that the first and second ranks in the number of price increases are precisely the necessities of people's daily lives - food and beverage and food supplies. No wonder the general public is loudly calling for the threat to their livelihoods! Now, the types of goods with price increases and the percentage of price increases are listed below one by one:</p>
<p>(1) Banquets: At least 16 yuan per table.</p>
<p>(2) Western Food: Central District, lunch increased to 1.2 yuan per person, dinner 1.65 yuan, Western District, dinner 2 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Domestic Wine: Increased by 10% to 15% based on the original price.</p>
<p>(4) Soy Sauce Color: Increased by half a yuan per can based on the original price, to 7.2 yuan, then increased by 5 cents, sold at 7.7 yuan.</p>
<p>(5) Bean Curd: Bean curd skin increased by 180 Wen per sheet, bean curd skin by 20 Wen per sheet, 660 Wen per catty, dried bean curd by 30 Wen per piece, old bean curd by 1,800 Wen per board, tender bean curd by 1,700 Wen per board, coarse fried dough sticks by 900 Wen per catty, fine fried dough sticks by 1,000 Wen per catty, and triangle oil bean curd by 20 Wen per piece.</p>
<p>(6) Tea Making: Increased by 25% per yuan based on the original price.</p>
<p>(7) Fresh Orange Water: Increased by 5 cents to 10 cents per dozen.</p>
<p>(8) Packaged Meals: Increased by 1 yuan per person based on the original price.</p>
<p>(9) Beer: Prices increased twice, adding 3 yuan per case for bottled beer and 9 cents per liter for barrel beer. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Zhenjiang relies heavily on the foreign drug business. Shipments from Shanghai and earned commissions adequately reward labor. However, recently, a certain foreign firm in Shanghai set up a branch there, causing fear among the merchants who worried the earlier business would be harmed. Thus, they falsely established rules to seize control. Now, their rules are recorded below: "1. It is resolved that if any local or guest merchant who has dealings with any firm, is found to have dealings with a foreign firm that violates the rules, they are limited to seven days to clear their accounts. If they fail to clear their accounts within seven days, the goods of said merchant will be reported to the Consulate, confiscated, sold to clear the accounts, and notice will be given that no further transactions will occur with that merchant. If any further transactions occur, a fine of 500 taels of 24-bao silver will be imposed. 2. It is resolved that if any local seller is found to be working for a firm that violates the rules, they will never be employed by any firm. If employed, a fine of 500 taels of 24-bao silver will be imposed. 3. It is resolved that if any firm takes a bill of lading from a violating firm and picks up goods privately, it will still be handled according to the previous resolution. 4. It is resolved that the foreign firm's public office will dispatch 40 patrolmen to prevent any firm from insinuating and violating the rules." The matter was reported to the Shanghai Consul, who, because the merchants recklessly issued rules and monopolized foreign drugs, issued a proclamation prohibiting it on the one hand, and investigated and punished the ringleaders on the other.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Great Fire at Xiaodongmen <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The great fire at Xiaodongmen last night was unprecedented since the establishment of the concessions. It stretched from the city moat in front to the foreign merchants' street in the rear, from Lujiazai Bridge in the south to Wanshoutai Yamen in the north, covering an area of one or two dozen acres, with hundreds of shops all reduced to ashes. At 3:30, a fire broke out in Hongzhishao's candle shop at Lujiazai Bridge. A strong southerly wind fanned the flames, and before an hour had passed, it had spread like wildfire, not being extinguished until 6:30 in the morning. Approximately more than two hundred houses were destroyed, mostly shops. The merchants lost all their capital, which is truly pitiful! What is regrettable is that the fire bell in the British Concession was late in sounding the alarm, because the watchman in the bell tower failed to inspect properly. Moreover, both concessions have electrical wires, but it is unknown why they were not used at this time.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Learning a Specialized Skill <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Children: When you read the newspaper, besides the important war news and the international situation, do you also read the local news? If so, then you should know that not long ago, there was a college student who was a beggar. Speaking of which, what does this matter have to do with you children? Upon careful study and reasoning, it is very meaningful.</p>
<p>If I were to ask a question now: "Why did that college student have to beg for food?" You would definitely be able to give a very satisfactory answer, saying: "He was poor, so poor that he had no food to eat, so he was forced by circumstances to become a beggar." This is certainly correct. But I will ask again: "Why was that college student so poor that he had nothing to eat?" I think the more intelligent children will answer: "He was affected by the war, so he became poor." The reason is indeed correct, but putting the blame for his poverty and begging completely on the war is still incomplete. Why?</p>
<p>It's all because that college student did not have a truly solid specialized skill. Otherwise, he would not have to shamelessly beg for money from others. What is a "truly solid" "specialized skill"? Let's give a few examples: A carpenter can saw and plane wood, nailing it into a table, and can build a house with many pieces of wood. This is a specialized skill. A mason can build a solid wall with many bricks, and can pour cement. This is a specialized skill. A machinist can use a lathe to turn out a gear without any errors, and can know where the machine is broken and repair it. This is a specialized skill. Knowing how to assemble a radio, make leather shoes, type quickly, set type, ... these are also specialized skills. As for "truly solid," it means practical, and it is also a way of saying that you can actually do it yourself.</p>
<p>Children: I'm not lying, many students who graduate from middle school and university know a little bit of this and a little bit of that. They seem like "omnipotent doctors," but in reality, they are like "pig's head meat, not good at anything." They don't have a single skill, and what they know is empty, they can talk but can't do. May I ask, in this society where survival competition is very fierce, how can they not fail! How can they earn a living! The society of the future will only allow people with real skills to eat. So, dear children, you are all future middle school and university students, and you are all part of the future society. You should learn from the lessons of the past, choose what is closest to your personality, and learn a specialized skill as the foundation for your future independence, so as not to be oppressed by the environment. Although you are still young, you must first acquire basic knowledge, but paying attention in advance is always easier than digging a well when you are thirsty. Time passes quickly, and in the blink of an eye, you will go from elementary school to middle school, and then to university. "If you don't work hard when you are young, you will only grieve when you are old!" Children: remember, remember.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Barbaric Body, Civilized Mind <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Po Lin Shan Si</p>
<p>The eight words used as the title are the motto of Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press. Mr. Wang often uses this to encourage himself and others. In a speech he gave several years ago, he also explained these eight words in detail. Because I still remember the original speech very clearly, I decided to record it and talk to you children.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's explanation of "barbaric body" is: Some people say that I work 14 hours a day. You may doubt how much energy an old man has, but in fact, sometimes it may even exceed 14 hours, reaching 15 or 16 hours. Although I work a lot, I have never suffered from any diseases due to the heavy work. From a health perspective, it seems inhuman, but the reason why I am not prone to disease is really because my body has strong resistance. On the one hand, it is also because of the maintenance of interest, so I have never felt any pain. This is just like the reason why some people play cards all night without feeling tired. Therefore, we should train a barbaric physique to overcome all bad environments.</p>
<p>Regarding the explanation of "civilized mind," Mr. Wang once said, "We don't have to have civilized enjoyment, but we must have civilized imagination," these two sentences. Mr. Wang also said that a barbaric body, if not supplemented by a civilized mind, then humans will always be savages. A civilized mind, if not supplemented by a barbaric body, will only become a weak scholar who can "speak" but cannot "act."</p>
<p>For the sake of space, I don't want to add anything more, because Mr. Wang has explained the accurate meaning and interrelationship of these eight words in detail. Finally, I hope that all of you children will stand up together and take Mr. Wang Yunwu, whose motto "barbaric body, civilized mind" is worthy of our model, as the criterion for establishing ourselves and cultivating ourselves. Because in this unreasonable world and the period when the country is in trouble, we have a barbaric body, supplemented by a civilized mind, which is enough to save the country and survive.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Fish Also Know What is Right <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Hong</p>
<p>Modern scientific experiments have proven that fish have good memories and can use experience to learn. This is why many anglers feel that fish are good at avoiding.</p>
<p>Although people have been fishing for hundreds of years, they have never had a consistent answer to the question of how many sensory functions fish have. Fish naturally do not have sufficient prudence, comprehension, and selection power. If fish were all fools, it would be necessary for a smart person to study their intelligence. Dr. Brown works at the Illinois Natural History Institute, a naturalist. He recently took some largemouth black sharks as students and has given more than 14,000 lessons.</p>
<p>Teaching fish students is not a simple task at all. They learn to distinguish colors and practice remembering them. Like an old-fashioned teacher, Dr. Brown gives them a little reward for answering correctly and a little punishment for answering incorrectly. The colors they have to memorize are wrapped in a small glass tube and placed in the fish tank. When the fish swims close to this color, it is given a small water egg or mosquito larva to eat. The teacher also praises it: "You did well, fish!" But the wrong color is also placed in the tank in the same way. If a fish swims close to this wrong color, he touches its back with a metal wire carrying a weak electric current. This will give them a slight tremor. The teacher says, "Fish, you're wrong."</p>
<p>The largemouth black sharks seem to be in a very lively family; because after five to ten training sessions, most of them can accurately understand and distinguish between red or yellow, green or blue colors.</p>
<p>Previously, they were just primary students learning color distinction. Later, the homework became more and more difficult. The glass tubes wrapped in light and dark colors were placed in the tank, and the sharks had to learn to identify that rose red was the correct color, while poppy red was the wrong one. These experiments using various colors were to reach the extreme of the fish's eye color discrimination sensation and then stop. This kind of homework is too difficult.</p>
<p>As expected, fish have color sensations like humans. Dr. Brown said: "It is possible that fish can identify various colors by looking out from a light yellow filter, just like humans with normal color vision."</p>
<p>Among Dr. Brown's discoveries, the most interesting thing is that fish can remember which color is right and which is wrong for several weeks or even a month or two without forgetting. Fish that have already learned that "red is the right color" will find it easier to learn "different shades of red" after a considerable period of time. Dr. Brown naturally does not expect his students to remember forever, which would make fish more clever than humans. (Translated from Parade)</p>

<h3 id="e156">The Evolution of Copper Coins <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>These past few days, there has been a copper coin shortage panic in Shanghai's markets. This is a phenomenon caused by the invaders plundering resources to create instruments of aggression. Currently, stamps, revenue stamps, and tokens issued by some companies are circulating in the market as substitutes for copper coins. However, the lack of copper coins is still a significant inconvenience.</p>
<p>Children! Do you know how people in ancient times traded when there were no coins?</p>
<p>In the very ancient times, people "worked at sunrise and rested at sunset." Everyone's own production was sufficient for their own needs, so there was no need for buying and selling, and therefore no need for coins. Later, people's lives gradually became more complex, and one person's production was not enough for one person's needs, so bartering arose. For example, if you have two bolts of cloth and I have one peck of rice, and I want cloth and you want rice, we can exchange your cloth for my rice, and the transaction is complete.</p>
<p>However, this system of bartering had many inconveniences. If I want cloth but you don't want rice, then we can't exchange. Moreover, if the values of the goods we each possess are not equal, then we also can't exchange. Therefore, everyone agreed on a certain item to serve as a medium of exchange and a standard for calculating value. That item was currency.</p>
<p>Ancient currencies included things like: seashells, animal skins, livestock, feathers, cloth, and so on. However, these things also had many inconveniences. It wasn't until the time of the Yellow Emperor that "metal was cast into knives," marking the beginning of metal currency.</p>
<p>There were several types of metal currency, such as copper coins, silver coins, gold coins, nickel coins, etc. Here is a picture that will show you "The Evolution of Copper Coins in Our Country."</p>

<p>"His speech is indeed very good, he has spoken to me so fluently several times, so I didn't memorize all the words. He often started his speeches very impressively," she continued, hoping to pique my interest. "People and power create all sorts of great miracles in history, and we can discover that this is transformed from destiny!"</p>
<p>"May God bless this child!" I thought, looking at her happy and proud face, which filled me with indescribable surprise. I wondered how such grand phrases could come from the mouth of such a young child.</p>
<p>The program on the graduation ceremony order was proceeding, gradually approaching the one that she was focusing all her attention on, which made her feel very uneasy. Her eyes were wide and shining, and two deep red clouds rose on her cheeks.</p>
<p>"It's his turn now," she said to me with a tone of pride, joy, and unease. The prelude began to play, and his name was called out loudly. She was longing twelve million times over to see the sight of him stepping onto the stage. She tiptoed and stretched her feet forward, as if she had forgotten about me at this moment. I knew her breathing was very tense, and her heart seemed to be jumping out of her throat. Little did I know that her brother walked onto the podium, facing the audience. His body was also trembling, his hands hanging weakly, his face turning gray, and his lips turning blue. I also felt a little uneasy. She knew that this matter was not going well for her brother, and a look of fear immediately appeared on her face.</p>
<p>He gave the audience an unnatural bow, his face showing a confused state, and looked listlessly at the waiting audience, like someone dazed after waking from a dream. He stood there like a mute. Looking at him, I was afraid that he was flustered on stage.</p>
<p>Ah! His little sister! She shot a look of alarm at my face. "He forgot," she said, and a quick change appeared on her face as she looked intently at the stage. A soft and courageous child's voice broke the deathly silence in the hall.</p>
<p>People and power create all sorts of great miracles in history, and we can discover that this is transformed from destiny—every listener stopped breathing and listened attentively—the child's voice, the child's face, and the adult's words, all felt very surprising. But this rescue was too late. The dejected brother stumbled off the stage in shame. Then the music played again, and the lovely sound waves dispelled people's disappointment.</p>
<p>I looked at his sister with sympathy, but she didn't see me. Her eyes were filled with tears. I patted her, wanting to comfort her, but she was focused on her stone-faced brother. Later, I saw her go to support her shy and young brother, whose face was as blank as a mask.</p>

<p>— Xiao Tan</p>
<p>A swallow who had traveled many times had broad knowledge and rich experience. He was able to foresee the coming of wind and rain or disasters. One day, he came to a place where ramie was being sown. He saw a farmer scattering seeds in the furrows.</p>
<p>The swallow said to the little birds, "This sight makes me unhappy, and I am worried for you. If I were you, I would not dare to live in such a dangerous place. Have you seen what that hand is doing? Soon, what he sows will destroy your existence. Many traps or nets will be spread here, and many things will catch you, lock you in cages, or throw you into pots. At that time, even if you don't die, you will become prisoners. For this reason, I advise you to quickly eat up the seeds and believe my prediction."</p>
<p>The little birds repaid him with ridicule. Because at this time, there were many good things to eat in the fields, and they didn't have to bother searching for those tiny ramie seeds.</p>
<p>When the ramie fields turned green, the swallow said to them again, "Pull out the seedlings that have grown from those cursed seeds one by one. Otherwise, you will surely perish."</p>
<p>"Prophet of misfortune, garrulous bastard!" the little birds said. "You are asking us to do a good job! We would need a thousand people to pull out all the ramie seedlings in this entire place."</p>
<p>After some time, the ramie grew tall. The swallow came to advise them again: "This is not a good sign. The hateful rogues are about to come, but until now, no one has believed me! You will see that when the wheat is ripe and people are no longer working, they will come to attack the little birds. At that time, nets will be spread everywhere to catch you. I advise you not to fly around everywhere anymore, but to stay safely in your nests or move to another place. But your bodies are not like mine, able to travel across wildernesses and cross rivers and seas. Therefore, your only safe way is to stay in your nests in the wall holes and not come out."</p>
<p>The little birds were annoyed by the swallow's words. They ignored him and just chirped noisily, flying back and forth and playing in the ramie fields. As a result, they were all caught in nets and never had freedom again.</p>
<h3 id="e159">In the Realm of Animals (7) <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Peng Qi made up his mind to walk towards the riverbank, but for some reason, he first went to the big willow tree to take a look, perhaps the corpse was already placed there! But looking down, he didn't see any dog corpse, only a small cat. An incomplete old basket and a rolled-up towel. When Peng Qi raised his head to look at the drooping willow branches, he saw a bright moon shining down from the branches, seemingly exceptionally large and exceptionally close. He thought that if he sat on the branches, he could grab the moon with just a stretch of his hand.</p>
<p>Immediately, he thought of a book his mother had, which was now in the hands of his two younger sisters. The book was very interesting. It said that when a dog's life ends in the human world, it goes to the moon. There was also a picture on the flyleaf of the book, depicting many dogs sitting in the moon, telling each other about their past experiences.</p>
<p>Peng Qi muttered to himself, "If the dog we killed last night has already gone to the moon, that would be strange."</p>
<p>As he said this, he kept his eyes fixed on the moon, as if he saw the people in the moon winking at him.</p>
<p>Peng Qi said loudly, "Is what the book says true?"</p>
<p>The person in the moon replied, "Although not entirely true, it is somewhat similar. This is the realm of animals. Would you like to come up and play?"</p>
<p>Peng Qi hurriedly said, "Oh, I've never been here before!" The person in the moon said very cordially, "Then, why don't you come for a visit? But you may not be able to climb up."</p>
<p>Peng Qi was unconvinced and said loudly, "See if I can't climb up!" As he said this, he climbed up the tree. In three minutes, he had reached the high branches and was very close to the moon. The higher he climbed, the larger the moon appeared. Finally, it was like a round and bright light shining from a divine lamp, brightly filling the sky. When Peng Qi climbed to the highest point, everything disappeared, and he only saw thousands of rays of white light surrounding him.</p>
<p>He heard the person in the moon say loudly, "Be bold and come in. Extend your foot. Don't be afraid; it's not very bright inside." So Peng Qi stretched out his foot and jumped down. He thought he had fallen into the river. But when he stomped his feet, he felt that the ground was solid. It turned out that he had arrived in the realm of animals. This place was truly a strange and unbelievable place!</p>
<p>At the entrance of the realm of animals sat a dog, clearly acting as a guard there. On the back of this black dog sat a crow. Although some of its feathers had been plucked, its black feathers were still shiny and intact. In a field behind it, there was an Irish wild bull, a mad wild bull, but it did not harm anyone. There was also an old cow wandering there, but because it was too old, it could no longer work. Near them, there was a mare grazing. Its nest was in a corner of the field, and a robin sat in the nest, seemingly thinking about something.</p>
<p>A tit was flying near the nest. This small bird could tell stories and convey news. It never rested and did not even have a nest itself, but its rumors were often unfounded and could cause trouble. A cat's cradle was swaying in the sky, and a cat was lying inside. It knew how to wash dishes, so a clean dishcloth was tied under its head. It waited for the sun to rise and immediately went to work. In addition, he saw the bees flying up and down, seemingly very busy. He didn't know what they were busy with.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Silver Union Patriotic Goods Charity Sale <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Yi</p>
<p>Starting today at the Third Floor of the Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank, the event will last for eight days, aiming to raise 5,000 yuan, with all proceeds going to the disaster relief funds for hygiene during the summer for those in need.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silver Trade Union, with 20,000 members, consists of enthusiastic young people from Shanghai's silver industry. Under their unity this month, they are leading the city's silver industry youth in various beneficial activities. For example, their drama troupe has performed many times. Recently, to participate in the charity sale performance, they invited Xia Xia to direct "Deferring Debt Repayment," which is currently being rushed to completion.</p>
<p>Starting at 9:00 AM today, they will hold a moderately sized charity sale exhibition at their association – the third floor of the Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank on Nanjing Road (near Henan Road).</p>
<p>The presiding committee of this charity sale exhibition consists of directors and managers from major banks in Shanghai. Their names are as follows: Xu Jiqing, Lin Kanghou, Pan Jiyan, Xu Binzhang, Zhou Dexin, Pan Yangqiao.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ms. Huang Guoxiu, wife of Sun Ruihuang, deputy manager of Xinhua Bank, has been invited to perform the ribbon-cutting ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Disaster Relief Hygiene Funds <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, when I visited their association, the calligraphy and painting section was being set up, but other sections did not seem to have started yet. The two gentlemen I spoke with were Fang Zuyin and Feng Shujin. One is the vice chairman of the Welfare Committee of the Silver Industry Association, and the other is the vice chairman of the Cooperative Affairs Committee. This charity sale exhibition is organized by these two committees.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Fang, this event was originally organized at the request of the hygiene group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, and all funds raised will be allocated to the disaster relief funds for hygiene during the summer for those in need. Moreover, various sectors are enthusiastically holding charity sale campaigns, and the silver industry should of course step forward to contribute more to this campaign.</p>
<p>Therefore, after accepting this request in early May, they cooperated through the two committees to take charge of all matters.</p>
<p>Aiming to Raise 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The process has naturally been very smooth. Many manufacturers have agreed to participate in this charity sale, but most of them are donating based on a percentage of sales. However, in terms of price, they are trying their best to make the goods cheaper than those outside, so that customers can have real benefits.</p>
<p>They plan to raise a total of 5,000 yuan from this charity sale. In advance, they specially printed 5,000 yuan worth of discount coupons, including one-yuan and two-jiao denominations, for members to sell.</p>
<p>Two thousand yuan worth of one-yuan coupons were given to various firms to be responsible for selling, and three thousand yuan worth of two-jiao coupons were sold by the members themselves. As of yesterday's deadline, 3,000 yuan worth of discount coupons had been sold, with another 2,000 yuan yet to be brought in. However, they believe that reaching the 5,000 yuan goal should not be a problem.</p>
<p>The Venue is Divided into Five Groups</p>
<p>The charity sale venue is divided into five groups, with these five groups separately negotiating with various manufacturers. These five groups are:</p>
<p>(1) Medical and Hygiene Products Group - This group has the most items, with larger participating pharmacies and factories including the China-West Pharmacy, China Chemical Industry Society, Modern Chemical Industry Society, and many other manufacturers.</p>
<p>(2) Practical Goods Group - Includes Kang Yuan Can Factory, Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center, Xu Si Tie Factory, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Food Group - Includes Tai Kang Candy Company and Cai Zhi Zhai, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Weaving Group - Includes Jing Lun Shirt Weaving Factory, New Life Women's Arts and Crafts Society, etc.</p>
<p>(5) Calligraphy and Painting Group - Recently, the Central Savings Society held a calligraphy and painting exhibition, and most of the works in this charity sale were transferred from there, including works by Mr. Zou Mengchan, Shen Zicheng, Xie Shiyue, Yuan Songnian, Pan Hengfu, and Ms. Gu Qingyao, Xu Qiqin, and Zhu Yuleng.</p>
<p>Donations Based on a Percentage of Sales are More Common</p>
<p>From the conversation between Mr. Fang and Mr. Feng, I personally feel that there are too few completely donated items in any charity sale, such as this one. On the manufacturers' side, only the scientific chemical company's thermometers and the Aihua Pharmaceutical Factory's medicines (valued at about 40-50 yuan) are fully donated. The remaining manufacturers are donating based on a percentage of sales.</p>
<p>For the disaster relief funds for hygiene during the summer, major bankers and major manufacturers should all contribute a little more and donate a larger sum.</p>
<p>The Event Lasts for Eight Days</p>
<p>The charity sale will last for eight days, from the 2nd to the 9th. For the sake of those in need, ladies, gentlemen, philanthropists, you may wish to go to the charity sale venue on the third floor of the Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank to buy something. This is a million times better than burning incense and offering lamp oil at the Rainbow Temple.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Encouraging Learning and Farming, Storing Materials for the Country; Eliminating the Weak and Preserving the Strong, Selecting Seeds with a Field</p>
<p>He Guoyu pondered for a moment and said, "Then, I wonder if our future factory will be a nuisance to the villagers?" Village Chief Zhu laughed and said, "Probably not much of a hindrance. But when that time comes, we will also hold a meeting, or perhaps agree on a three-chapter law with your factory. This is also a method of mutual assistance, beneficial to everyone. Nowadays, China, including various factories, treats workers preferentially, which is very different from before the war. Many have also established vocational schools, attached to the factories, mostly at night. Because Chinese workers used to have many who were uneducated, and now it is felt that there are not enough. The factories establish vocational schools to allow them to study. If there are many female workers, they also attach nurseries to facilitate many female workers with children. In the future, when your silk weaving factory opens, a vocational school may not be necessary in other countries, but in our current China, because there was too much of a lack in the past, it cannot be without one now." Village Chief Zhu said, "The two most important things for a resurgent China are: one is production; the other is education. Someone talked to me about China's future, and I only said: production! production! and more production! education! education! and more education! These two things are like two wheels, driving China forward, and it cannot proceed without one. What do you two ladies say, is this right?" The two He ladies quite admired the words of this old man. At that time, they left the canal and walked slowly along a road. They saw a house being built over there, and Village Chief Zhu pointed it out to them, saying, "This is the paper mill, and the house will be completed in a month." He Bianyu suddenly asked, "Isn't the seed breeding field nearby?" Village Chief Zhu said, "It's not far from here. Do you want to go see it? It's a bit busier during silkworm rearing, but now it's quite spacious and there's not much to see." After returning to China, they were also engaged in silkworm rearing in their hometown of Guangdong. But it was not as prosperous as in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and they lived in the city, enjoying a comfortable life, and had not seen silkworm rearing. Now, silkworm farming in China, in addition to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, has been popularized in other provinces. The most prevalent after the war was in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. The original silkworm eggs were passed down from the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, so even though it was not silkworm rearing season, they also wanted to go see it. (150)</p>
<h3 id="e164">Du He and Yun He Collaborate on Fan Paintings <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>Among old friends, many use bird names as their nicknames: cranes, phoenixes, and lovebirds abound; even a skinny cuckoo like me has managed to join in, adding to the end of the line. If you were to ask about the ages of this group of bird brothers, you would have to push Yun He and Du He as the eldest brothers. Yun He (formerly known as Sick Crane) is a senior painter, skilled in figures, landscapes, embroidered feathers, and flowers – everything comes naturally. More than a decade ago, he served as a satirical cartoonist for three years in the local newspaper Zi Shan Tan, with a style that blended the old and new. Du He is a senior journalist who, because he had taken the imperial examination as a child during the late Qing Dynasty, had developed excellent calligraphy skills from a young age. Both He's are eloquent and good at telling jokes. With the two He's present, the atmosphere immediately becomes much livelier. They are known for their collaborations. When they start joking around, they can really make people laugh so hard they lose their hats and belts and hurt their stomachs. Since the beginning of summer, the two He's have been collaborating on fan paintings. Yun He paints, Du He writes, each with their own strengths. You only need to spend five yuan to order a He fan from the Xin Wen Bao office. Afterwards, holding it in your hand will be like holding the wings of a crane. A gentle breeze will naturally arise when you wave it in the wind, making your whole body feel cool.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Summer Schools <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>I hope that the teachers who organize summer schools can enthusiastically cultivate these students who are eager to learn, and also shoulder the earnest expectations of every parent!</p>
<p>The mercury in the thermometer has frequently climbed past ninety degrees. In early July, heat waves have already begun to roll through the crowded city. Whether it is elementary, middle, or high school, summer vacation has already begun, allowing students to recover from the fatigue of year-round studies. But on the other hand, this vacation is really too long. In general, parents are deeply afraid that their children's studies will be neglected due to the long vacation. Therefore, they all want to have them review the main subjects in the morning or evening. Also, students who are particularly poor in a certain subject all want to take advantage of this long summer vacation to ask someone to tutor them to make up for it. Thus, under the conditions of this environmental need, all kinds of summer schools have emerged.</p>
<p>These summer schools can be divided into the following four types based on their nature:</p>
<p>The first type belongs to summer schools like "Summer Children's Health Camps." Their characteristic is to provide children with a place with a beautiful environment and complete facilities during the hot summer, where the intelligence, morality, physical education, and aesthetics of children can be developed and enhanced under the joint care of teachers, nurses, doctors, and nannies. Therefore, the children they recruit are mostly limited to those aged four to fifteen. But because the fees are relatively high, they are not affordable for the average family, only upper and middle-class families have this ability. Otherwise, who wouldn't want to send their children to a better environment filled with educational meaning?</p>
<p>The second type is the summer schools attached to elementary and middle schools. The teachers who teach are of course mostly from the original school. The development of this type of summer school has three aspects of significance: On the student side, for a low price, they can receive a month of education, which is of course very necessary for families with insufficient financial resources to hire a tutor. Furthermore, if they fail one or two subjects, they will face the fate of "repeating a grade." Now, if they study at school and their grades are better, they can avoid this bad luck. (Because most schools have this flexible approach) On the teacher side, in Shanghai schools, most salaries are calculated at five months per semester. During the long summer vacation, there is no income at all, but expenses cannot stop. Moreover, with high rice prices and expensive firewood, life is even more difficult. If there is no "extra income" to supplement it, it is quite difficult. Seeking other jobs during the summer vacation is also impossible, so summer school has become the most ideal side job for everyone. As for the school, opening a summer school can both retain existing students and attract new students from outside the school, which is of course greatly beneficial to the school.</p>
<p>The third type is the original tutoring schools. To adapt to the season, they have also mostly added "summer classes" to broadly recruit new students and increase income. Their tutoring subjects range from foreign languages such as English, German, French, and Japanese to specialized skills such as accounting, advertising, engineering, and typing, almost encompassing everything, without exception. As for the level, it can range from the third or fourth grade of elementary school all the way to the third or fourth grade of university. The breadth of its scope is by no means something that general summer schools can hope to match. Therefore, the students in this type of summer school are very crowded.</p>
<p>The fourth type is the temporary summer schools. The teachers are college and university students studying at school. They use the summer vacation to gather a few classmates, borrow school buildings from their alma mater, or rent them temporarily on their own. On the one hand, they can use this to earn income to pay for the tuition for the next semester. On the other hand, they can also gain some teaching experience, but the quantity is very small.</p>
<p>Now is the enrollment period for various summer schools. In the blink of an eye, they will start school again. I hope that the teachers who organize the schools can enthusiastically cultivate these students who are eager to learn, and also shoulder the earnest expectations of every parent!</p>

<p>— Gu Lanjun</p>
<p>Writing About an Actress's Experiences and Thoughts</p>
<p>The Second Performance of "Thirteen Sisters" Left a Big Talking Point: Regarding the performance of dangerous scenes, some can use photographic techniques to deceive the audience. However, when encountering situations where the facts do not allow for pretense, one must take risks and engage in authentic performance. For example, a shot where one is supposed to leap from the ground and onto the roof can simply use reverse filming, where the actor leaps down from the roof to the ground, and when shown on the screen, it becomes a surprising scene of leaping upwards. This is much easier. However, for us girls, needless to say, we absolutely cannot jump upwards, and even jumping down from above makes us feel apprehensive and extremely afraid.</p>
<p>The last time, when filming "The Heroic Sons and Daughters," when Thirteen Sisters broke into the Nengren Temple, there was such a dangerous performance. In order to make the film exciting and to be faithful to my duties, I, as Thirteen Sisters, had no choice but to grit my teeth, be brave, and try it. Unexpectedly, standing on the roof, I took a sudden step forward, just as I was about to leap downwards, this hastily built house, the mud on top was quite damp and not very solid. As a result, my foot slipped, and I plunged straight down, my whole body flipping over high above and falling hard to the ground. The distance between the top and bottom, not very high, was at least a丈半 (about 12-18 feet), and at that moment, I landed on my arms, which hurt terribly. My soul was frightened out of my wits, and I felt a tight sensation in my chest, unable to breathe. Many colleagues, from the director downwards, were panicked and at a loss when they saw me fall like that. Fortunately, one gentleman was an expert in internal medicine. He immediately bent my legs upwards and pressed them firmly against my chest. It is said that this is an emergency treatment to relieve the congestion in the chest. Sure enough, in a short while, I took a long breath, and with it, I exhaled a stale air, and I slowly regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I felt fortunate that the injury was not severe. I only applied some ointment and did not seek medical treatment. The director, seeing me like this, said that the scene could be muddled through, and I didn't need to reshoot it. Later, the upper half of the film where I fell from the roof was edited and used. And what was shown on the screen was this unexpected "performance" of not showing when landing on the ground. For eternal remembrance, I specially saved a section of the discarded film. At the same time, this suffering left a terrible impression on my mind, which I have not been able to erase until now.</p>
<p>In addition, this unfortunate incident also left a funny joke for many partners: "Lanjun, do you need plaster?" "Miss Gu, do you need plaster?" Every day I went to the photography set, several friends would tease me like this, not only did others laugh, but even I myself often couldn't help but smile!</p>
<h3 id="e167">Has Stalin Watched Our Play? <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Li Lingshu</p>
<p>——Random Memories of Mei—(IV)</p>
<p>Since our performance in the Great Moscow, we have been paying attention at all times to whether there is a person with thick eyebrows and a big beard (Stalin) among the audience under the stage? But it has not been discovered. Eden, a young and handsome British diplomat (who was then the Minister in charge and was visiting the Russian capital), as well as British set designer Seven Yigden-Kries, and Mr. Litvinov, have all patronized us. Only a few important figures in the Soviet government, we always can't guess "whether they have watched our Chinese play"?</p>
<p>With such a final opportunity, all of our troupe members were very excited! They all thought they could admire the demeanor of Soviet dignitaries such as Stalin, Molotov... I think this is also a kind of worship of heroes, which everyone has.</p>
<p>The curtain rises! The final performance at the National Theatre begins! The Chinese and Soviet flags are hung on both sides of the front of the stage. When we were performing on the stage, part of our minds paid attention to the audience under the stage "Is there a person with thick eyebrows and a big beard"? I only saw two 包廂 (private boxes), which were empty, and no one was sitting in them. It seemed that they were waiting for the arrival of several important figures.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, the light in the box suddenly went dark! And the reflected light on our stage surface was especially stronger than usual! I glanced at the audience under the stage. Because of the strength of the lights, it seemed that a black curtain was suddenly lowered, and I couldn't see anything! Looking at the two boxes, there were only a few more dark shadows faintly! At this time, several strangers suddenly appeared backstage, waving their hands in their pockets, always looking like spies! I think you must know who he is?</p>
<p>After the play, a backstage staff member told us: "Stalin just came to see the play." But we did not see him in person, and we dare not say "Stalin must have watched our play." Therefore, we (members of the Mei Opera Troupe) have returned to China from our performances in the Soviet Union until today, and there is still such a question left in our minds: "Has Stalin watched our Chinese play?" (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e168">Yan Hou's First Performance on Stage <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Bingjiu</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 30th) was the first day of Yan Jupeng, Hou Yulan, and Huang Jin's performances. The plays were Yan's "Empty City Stratagem," Hou's "Yutang Chun," and Gao Shenglin's "Changban Slope" in the first act. I entered the theatre when "Changban Slope" was on stage. Shenglin, since his father's voice failed, has known to work hard. As a result, his skills have improved rapidly. This time, his performance of Huang Jin has received rave reviews. He is very proud, but he is not arrogant because of his fame. He can still follow the rules and regulations and strive for excellence. Mr. Yu has found such a promising successor, and his later years can be carefree.</p>
<p>Hou Yulan's "Yutang Chun"</p>
<p>Yulan specializes in Qingyi roles and is a follower of the Cheng school. She has the elegant nickname of "Female Yanqiu" in Peiping. Yesterday was her first performance in Shanghai, and many people supported her. The "bitter ah" sound inside the curtain was high-pitched and had a pause, which won a full house of applause. When she came on stage, the first three words of the Yao Ban aria "Lai Zhi Zai" were sung in a low register, and they were sung flatly, which was different from Yanqiu. The "Shang" character of "Wang Shang Guan," the "Fu" character of "Dao Fu Shou," and the "You" character of "Xin You Han" all had the Cheng flavor, and the pronunciation had a trembling sound, which was very similar. Someone sitting next to me said that it was due to stage fright, but in fact, this is precisely the characteristic of the Cheng style. Su San had just entered the Supervisory Office, and her heart was torn apart, so her pronunciation should have a sad sound. The Dao Ban "Yutang Chun Gui Zhi Zai Du Cha Yuan" was sung high into the clouds, and she was able to sing in harmony without breaking, which was very good. The "Da Ren Na" Huilong was neat and distinctive, and the slow measures were all highlights, especially the line "Shi Liu Sui Kai Huai Shi Na Wang Gong Zi" was the best. The original Ban aria in the back was average, but in the line "Zai Zhou Cang Shi Xia Xu Yi Xu Jiu Qing," "Xu Yi Xu" was raised, and the two words "Jiu Qing" were sung at the same time, as low as gossamer, with ups and downs and elegance. This kind of new tune is very beautiful in tone and is commendable. The Liushui "Qi Kong Liu Xie Ming Gui Yin" line was appropriately exaggerated. In the line "La La Che Che Dao Gong Ting," the two words "La La" were raised high, and the two words "Che Che" were lowered, with a lingering and euphemistic tone, and with a sad and constrained tone, which had the same effect as the "Xu Jiu Qing" line. This kind of creation of pleasant tones is the strength of the Cheng style, which Wan Hua does not have. However, in the line "Wang Gong Zi Yi Jia Duo He Shun, Nu Yu Ta Lu Shui Fu Qi You Shen Me De Qing," "Nu Yu Ta" was not well-worded. There seems to be a grammatical error. Yuqin has already changed "Nu Yu Ta" to "Ta Yu Nu." With the change of one word, the wording is very different. Since Yulan follows Cheng, she should follow suit. In the latter part, the Er Liu style of learning Cheng has not yet entered the hall. In the lines "Zhe Yi Chang Guan Si Wei Jing Tang Ao" and "Zhe Yi Chang Guan Si Wei Dong Xing," the pronunciation of the words "Wei" and "Xing" are not harmonious in pitch. The appearance is delicate and graceful, with elegance to spare, but not gorgeous. Judging from the performance style, she is indeed a Qingyi talent of the highest quality. The expressions on her face in the play are not yet perfect. The inner performance still needs to be improved. Tragedies are suitable for her. Her voice is round, sweet, and crisp, and she can handle heavy singing. Yesterday, she knelt and sang for three quarters of an hour, never drank on stage, and had no exhausted voice. Her talent is superior, and she is a great talent. After Yutang Chun finished, there was a ten-minute break.</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng's "Empty City Stratagem"</p>
<p>When he came on stage, Jupeng studied Tan, and he worked hard on the three aspects of "word," "tune," and "rhyme." "Empty City Stratagem" is Master Tan's masterpiece. Without profound skills, it is difficult to achieve the essence. The atmosphere of this play should be solemn and quiet, the expressions of the three reports should be different, and calmness should not be lacking, so those without arrogance cannot perform it, and those without noble air cannot perform it; the fiery temper cannot be too exposed, and the lukewarm solution is not appropriate; Jupeng is at the age of knowing destiny, performing this play is just right for his identity. The introductory aria was measured and accurate, and the pronunciation of the character "Che" in "Si Lun Zhuo" and the character "Chen" in "Liang Dai Xian Chen" was correct, and they came out of his mouth heavily, like a thousand pounds. The line "Kuai Si Feng Yun" is also wonderful. The Yao Ban "Mian Lao Fu Qin Zi Li Qu Ba Zei Shou" with strength in the "Zei" character. "I have used soldiers for decades..." Every word is a pearl, every sentence is wonderful. "Lao Jun Men Yin He Gu Fen Fen Yi Lun," "Guo Jia Shi Yong Bu Zhao Er Deng Lao Xin," "Zhe Xi Cheng Yuan Ben Shi..." The three paragraphs were calm in their expressions and relaxed in their attitude, portraying Kong Ming's state of mind at the time in detail, especially the second act of coming on stage "Bing Chu Qi Shan Di..." was the most endearing, with a smile on his face. The state of mind is peaceful and calm. Chang Ling often performs it with a sad face, which is really unreasonable. When coming on stage for the second act, he had not seen the map, had not received the bad news, and was full of expectations that Ma Su would lead the troops to retreat and return victoriously. The lines he recited were also praising himself for his proper use of troops and the certainty of victory, and he had absolutely no air of resentment. Upstairs, the slow Ban, the line "Yi Xian Di Ye Xia Nan Yang Yu Jia San Qing" was good, the rest was average, and there were no alert sentences in the Er Liu style. The line "Lai Lai Lai..." beckoned to Sima Yi, seeming a bit fiery. In short, the city tower section is the most difficult to sing. Jupeng's expression is unrestrained and natural. After listening to it, the vulgar dust disappears. This kind of skill is related to the heat. When the heat is reached, it can naturally be revealed unconsciously, and it cannot be forced. Jupeng, due to the fatigue of traveling, seemed unable to be very happy. The Dao Ban in the back act "Nu Zai Xin Tou Nan Xiao Hen" and the high-pitched places such as "Huo Dan" could not be used freely. It is said that he accidentally had a minor illness yesterday and went on stage with the illness. It is appropriate to have this scene. The regret after beheading Ma Su was intertwined, which was a sigh. He was not lukewarm, and his spirit was very good. Ma Liankun's Ma Su's speech was thoughtful and powerful, and his performance was also meticulous and thorough. Zhao Shengrong's Sima Yi's voice was natural and pleasant, he is a future copper hammer beautiful talent. With these left and right assistants, they achieve the effect of embellishing the peony leaves.</p>

<h3 id="e169">The Tea Dance of Immortal Music for Saving the Suffering <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>

<p>Same Dancing, Different Qualities, Creating Blessed Causes, Certainly Getting Blessed Results</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, the Xian Qi Dance Hall is cooperating with the Refugee Relief Association. Every day from 4 to 8 pm, a special tea dance will be held at the Xian Qi Dance Hall, and major celebrities have been invited to participate in the dance. The income will be used to relieve refugees. The method is excellent and the intention is very good.</p>
<p>When the difficult public clock has passed and dinner time has not yet arrived, we need a place to spend time to dispel the noise. Visiting parks and watching movies are also good ways to spend time, but watching movies has time constraints, and it is difficult to find companions to visit parks. Only tea dances provide dance partners and county-level events. You can go and go as you please. There is no beginning and no end, so tea dance is the only good way to spend time. The only regret is that money is spent on useless paths. Now, at Xianle, what is spent is the cost of helping refugees. Helping refugees is a good thing. It is said: "A family that accumulates good deeds will surely have blessings." It is said, "Today you save people, and one day people will save you." This is the so-called causal law. It is a way to put funds into a proper path. Tunting goods is afraid of rotting, investing in resources is depreciating widely, buying concession property is feared to be sealed and sold, why not buy some blessed fruit coupons, enjoy the fun, and enjoy the benefits, wouldn't it be good! When the reporter arrived at the scene, it was 4 pm. Mr. Yuan Ludeng was reporting, followed by Mr. Qingqia, followed by Fang Genbo, Lin Kanghou, Xie Baosheng, and guests Zheng Jun, Shao Xubai, etc. Lin's speech was the most moving. After the speech, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held. The movie stars who participated included Lu Ming, Xu Qinfang, Bai Hong, Bai Yan, Zhou Manhua, Gu Meijun, Yuan Shaomei, etc. I originally knew Qinfang and Zhaoming, and I was introduced, but in a blink of an eye, I forgot one of them. The weakening of memory is deeply regrettable! Each blessed fruit coupon costs one yuan and gets three dances. There will be a competition in the meeting, roughly divided into individual group, Guohua group, and dance group. The person who sells the most coupons will be awarded a prize by the association. It is also to increase the interest of dancers and dance stars to participate.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Film Companies Should Invite Shang Heyu to Make Films</p>
<p>His specialties, "Siping Mountain" and "Jinyang Palace," were all better than Xiao Lousheng's time. Moreover, he even avoided performing some of Mr. Shang's specialty plays, and at the same time, Heyu also put aside "Changban Slope," "Lianhuan Tao," and "Luoma Lake," which are heavily weighted on singing. This is probably because the fellow apprentices can respect righteousness and their ethics are higher than those of the younger generation. However, from this, it can also be inferred that Mr. Shang's abilities are indeed not weaker than Mr. Yang's. Since the deaths of Xiao Lou and Ji Rui, he has been overly saddened. It is said that he sold all his costumes and decided to retire from stage life and return to his hometown to farm. At that time, many opera fans all felt disappointed and wished they could go north to Tianjin to persuade him in person, asking him not to be so negative and to occasionally perform once in the hall or in charity performances, so that old people who appreciate opera could enjoy the performance. Who knew that suddenly the other day, a newspaper in this city said that a certain stage in this city had invited him to accompany Xun Huasheng to come south for a show. I think if Mr. Shang can really come to Shanghai, he will not only receive the warmest welcome from the audience and run his old luck, but at the same time, there are still some wealthy amateurs in Shanghai who are prepared to keep the old gentleman in Shanghai and ask him to teach a few of Yu Pai martial arts operas, so as not to be lost in the future. However, with all due respect, the local film company should take this opportunity to make a film of Mr. Shang's masterpieces. This would not only preserve our country's drama in case of emergency and greatly benefit future martial arts students, but also make a lot of profit in terms of business. As the national affairs are, even if the war stops, I am afraid that there will be no time to make drama films for a while. However, Mr. Shang is already nearly seventy years old. If we do not pay attention to this as soon as possible, I am deeply afraid that we will follow in Mr. Yang's footsteps, making people regret it too late.</p>
<p>There are two famous martial arts students in Shanghai, both of whom are Mr. Shang's students, one is Han Changbao and the other is Lin Shusen. It is a pity that Changbao's voice is too narrow, so he was quite unsuccessful when he performed on the Xinheng Stage in the past. In fact, his skills are highly praised by insiders. Later, I heard that he specializes in teaching opera. I don't know where he has drifted to in the past few years. Although Shusen is famous for his Guan Opera, "Shi Wengong" and "Taishi Ci" were all personally taught by Mr. Shang. However, he did not get as much of Mr. Shang's true teachings as Han Changbao. However, he has a good voice, so he has been very successful for many years. (50)</p>

<p>Opening Method 49th Game</p>
<p>Black Goes First</p>
<p>Screen Horse Against Central Cannon Playing Method Following the Last Game</p>
<p>Chariot 1 to 4 Cannon 8 to 6 Chariot 4 advances 4 Chariot 9 to 8 Cannon 2 to 4 Horse 7 advances 5 (Explanation)</p>
<p>From Cannon 2 to 5 to Pawn 5 advances 2, in the previous game, one should respond with Elephant 3 advances 5, and then Cannon 8 advances 3 to hit the horse and lose 9. Now, in this game, change to responding after 10 and then advancing the Elephant. The playing method is more appropriate than before. Chariot 2 to 3 to Cannon 8 advances 3 is Black's official move, then Chariot 1 to 4 protects the horse. On the surface, it seems to conveniently move the chariot out, and after protecting the horse, one can also keep the central pawn, but in fact, Chariot 1 to 4 is not the right move. Try watching the following moves, such as Cannon 8 to 6 to Horse 7 advances 5, Red has already lost the initiative invisibly. Chariot 1 to 4 should be changed to Horse 4 advances 3, which should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>The "Exhausted and Hoarse" Playing Method the Other Day</p>
