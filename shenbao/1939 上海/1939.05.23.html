<h3 id="c9">德義同盟 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>正當英蘇兩國不憚煩勞於所謂『對案』所謂『折衷方案』，談判進展近於半睡眠狀態的時候，德義兩國卻於昨天完成了締結同盟，簽訂政治軍事條約的正式手續。盟約七條，簡單明瞭：它本身所包涵的內容，較之一年來兩國勾結的事實，并沒有何種新意義，但是它客觀的意義，卻揶揄諷刺了英蘇談判。</p>
<p>希特勒與墨索里尼打著反共的虛偽幌子，掩護侵略的本來面目。他們以前以深沉的決心，發動侵略；現在以公開的同盟，表示決心。原來自從慕尼黑協定以後，英國傳統政策所維持的歐洲均勢，完全破壞了。張伯倫縱容德義的『綏靖』政策，根本推翻了歐陸百年來傳統的均勢。照張伯倫達拉第的打算，他們原是想藉慕尼黑的退讓拆散德義的勾結—加深他們在中歐的衝突；想以捷克的犧牲打開希德勒東進的門戶。他們希望希特勒在中東歐得到了滿足，回頭就會去履行他在『我的奮斗』所宣佈的『東進』諾言的。可是到了今天，『綏靖』政策終於完全失敗了；昨天簽字的盟約，至少證實了拆散政策的失敗。今後的東進西進，乃至於南進北進，專候民治國家給他適當的機會。</p>
<p>希特勒不是傻子。他知道蘇聯的力量。他在聯共十八屆黨大會史丹林的報告中，領略了好多意味。至少到了現在，他決不攻堅而戰蘇聯。原來在希特勒今年的幾次演說中，他已修正了『我的奮斗』。他公然要求殖民地；這在『我的奮斗』中是不曾提過的。他又曾一再表示『在任何戰爭中，德國都將與義國站在一起』。這一切，都顯然有著濃厚的反英意味。『我的奮斗』不是反英的。但法西斯敲詐的勝利，以及他們在西班牙的『成就』，郤已揭開了歐洲嚴重局勢的一個新階段。德義軍事同盟便是這嚴重局勢的更加公開，更加表面化。英國業已成了他們最直接的對象。最近柏林的積極建造海軍，證明了希特勒對於英法，實在比對於蘇聯更注意。一切拆散德義軸心的聰明企圖，業已證明了是一種浪費的幻想。和平斷不能用以拆散他們為目的的『綏靖』政策來建立。一個堅決建立起來的普遍和平，纔可以使他們侵略的共同意愿，歸於粉碎！</p>
<p>在這樣情形之下，英國的人民和輿論日益覺醒起來，都覺得有急起與法蘇合作，建立反侵略陣線的必要；英蘇談判就是在這種力量推動之下產生的。可是張伯倫首相卻還是未必有對蘇澈底合作的決心，更不曾放棄對德義妥協的幻想。老實說：他還想在這新方向上進行他的舊政策。他想拿英蘇接近作為脅誘希特勒的武器，他想重重課蘇聯以片面的義務，以達到其『買櫝還珠』的企圖。因而，英國盡管一再提出『對案』『折衷案』來，英蘇談話終是沒有多大的進展。</p>
<p>德義軍事同盟終於正式簽字了。英蘇談判中的半睡眠狀態或因揶揄諷刺而醒覺。我們為了普遍的反侵略，普遍的和平，希望英蘇談判立即醒覺而急起直追；但是我們的聽覺嗅覺同時又發覺了麻醉性催眠性的氣息。德義盟約雖無新意義，而德國外相里賓特洛甫與義國外相齊亞諾，在簽了盟約，喝了香賓以後，發表的廣播演說和對記者談話，（俱見本日新聞欄柏林電）在色厲內荏之中，透露了不少的誘惑。他們對於張伯倫的綏靖政策，對於羅斯福的和平呼吁，輕輕地呵了一口溫柔氣。這在心志不定，認識不清的人，夠麻醉，夠催眠。張伯倫早想拆散德義軸心，沒有成功；而德義即以其人之道，還治其人之身，昨日簽字後的演說和談片，未始不想打斷英蘇的談判。當然，張伯倫究竟老成了，究竟也不是傻子。</p>

<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>—捷克滅亡以來—　（歐洲通訊）</p>
<p>從整個人類的命運上去看，一個空前的，非常可怕的局面，現在，已經就在面前了。牽在裹面的，已經不僅是各個國家的利害問題，而是彼此體系的生死存亡的問題；不僅是地球上某一部份內的幾個國家和民族的問題，而是全世界上全人類的共同問題。假如這一個大戰爆發，那時，彼此用來相拼的，是（說得誇大一點）自有文明以來，人類所創造的一切成果；而由這一個大戰所產生的呢，是（說得深長一點）未來人類文明的整個前途。現在，中國已在央勇地抗戰，壯烈地犧牲，捷克，和阿爾巴尼亞，是亡了。英國還想爲老了的帝國的生存，作最後掙扎；日·德·意·還在作夢，想藉了暴力，把二十世紀拉回到十九世紀以前的帝國主義者殖民擴張的時代去；比較幸福的，祇有美國，和蘇聯，可是在另一面，落在這兩國身上的重擔，比起任何國來，都耍重。——根本上，各國共同的問題呢，却祇有一個。</p>
<p>上面所述的，是廢話麼？在我想，絕對不是；我的意思，是在沒有叙述歐洲最近局勢之前，耍先提醒讀者們一點；那就是：目前歐洲危機眞正的意義，到底是什麼。</p>
<p>目覩到這一個大事變前奏中種種過程的我們，有時候，是感到十二萬分的緊張；而一想到中國未來的光明前途，叉覺到說不出的興實。在國內，從每天報紙上，經過了全世界的電訊，大家可以看到許多關於歐洲局勢的演變；然而這裏面，有著缺漏，也有着別有用意的造謠。在歐洲呢，不用說，格外是到處充滿了謠言，曲解和宣傳。怎麼方能正確地判斷事態呢？這，確實不是容易的事。不過，我們最低限度的指針，是；一，我們是全人類五分之一的二十世紀的中國人，二，因而，我們堅決地站在進步的立塲上。</p>
<p>現在我便把捷克滅亡以來德·意·在歐洲所以造成以及目前著手鑄造的，幾個大危機的演變，叙述如次。</p>
<p>捷克滅亡了</p>
<p>用不釗二十四小時，希特拉呑了一個獨立國。可是，這並不是什麼令歐洲各國當局們吃驚的事。誰都知道，這一决進攻捷克的德國幾路大軍，遠在去年九月以前，就已經預備妥當；沒有「慕尼黑會議」的話，據希特拉向各國—允其英·法·—的當局說，他就早已打算道麼幹了的。「慕尼黑會議」實際上，是完全解除了掩克的武裝，使牠陷入等於毫無國防的窘困境地。所以，在英國，自那時以來，就有了這麼一句口頭禪：「捷克麼？哼，牠現在是德國的一省」！所以，問題的焦點，是在於；已經由英·法·和平地默認捷克是德國的屬地之後，爲什麼，在進時候，希特拉要來這直截的一手？</p>
<p>對於這一問題正面的答案是很容易找到的；爲了英·法·的擴張軍備，爲了沙赫特博士對英經濟談判的失敗，爲了德國資源的羅掘俱窮；因而，德國不得不採取强掠手段，一舉而據捷克的軍備資源爲己有，把牠同樣地編在瘋在般備戰的所謂「四年計劃」的各個單位裏。據一般估計，德國這一决所獲的現成武器，相當於英國目前軍需工業生產量的十八個月的總和！至於其他資源和生產工具，那是，大到連估計也估計不出的。</p>
<p>不過，比起這一個問題來，還有更加重大的問題在；佔了捷克後的德國動向是什麼呢—東進？或者是西進？</p>
<p>當時，在英，法，兩國發生了兩派的看法；一派，以爲這是德國東進」的信號，而所謂「東進」也者，在他們，是指着攫取蘇聯的烏克蘭。另一派，則以爲，實際德國是在東方攫取各種資源，穩定後方之後，一轉而和波蘭締結一個類似互不侵犯條的的東西，把蘇俄隔開去；然後，再和意大利聯起來，向英·法·要求重分世界。因爲這兩種看法的不同，因而，在接着而起的希特勒向羅馬尼亞提出「哀的美頓書」的問題上，在英·法·就發生了很大的爭議。允其在英國，以西門現任財相爲首領的，所謂「東進」看法的這一派，非常固執地主張，英國應當不加過問。依他們的觀點，德國爲了要攻擊蘇聯，侵略羅馬尼亞，倒無寧是必要的一着。不然，他們反問着；「你怎麼呌希特拉去攻擊蘇聯呢，假如他和蘇聯沒有共同國界的話？」所以，他們主張，英·法·的對德防錢，應當在土耳其：土耳其以西，德·意·可以任意去活動：如果到了境內，英·法·就要開始抵抗了：不然的話，也許德·意·要搶印度·和埃及！可是，另一派，以現任外相哈里法克斯爲首的所謂「西進」看法，覺得前一派實在是非常冒險的打算；因爲，現在戰爭發動力的主要物品，是煤油，而作爲英國對德作戰的最拿手的好戯，實際上却是食糧的封鎖：假如德·意·取得了所有巴爾幹半島各國的煤油和食糧，那時候，英·法·還有什麼手段，足以致德·意·的死命。</p>
<p>不用說，後一派看法，在英國是佔着壓倒的優勢的。剛剛蘇聯的態度，特別緘默起來。加上德國內部以戈林爲代表的一派德蘇默契說的要人們，父正在得勞，於是，這又更促成了英國當局們的加倍警惕。這一點上，他們，不得不回憶到就在二月裏日本向德國提議先行進攻蘇聯的計劃被拒。那時，日本感到中國戰爭的渺茫了，向德國提議，先聯合起來，打倒這個作爲「世界禍亂根源的赤化國家！」可是德國的回答，却是：不！</p>
<p>這一切，令英國現政府下了最大决意。那決意的第一步，是保證波蘭領土主權的完整並簽定五助協定。第二步，是保證羅馬尼亞和希臘的獨立。這麼一來，德·波·進一步的默契，是斷了希望；而萬一德國轉而向英·法·進攻的話，波蘭立刻有在東方響應英國攻擊德國的義務；在德·波·戰爭裏，如果以爲蘇聯可以袖手不問，那簡直是孩子話。所以，這麼一來，英國當局們計算着，他們實際是已經可以把蘇聯拉進來了。所以，英·波·互助協定的成功，實在英國現任政府的一大功績；較之對波蘭來，這一協定對英國，是有着更大利益的。</p>
<p>面對着這一形勢的德國，是絕不肯不答覆的。於是——</p>
<p>（一）阿爾巴尼亞滅亡了</p>
<p>這一個僅僅八十多萬人口的小國，實際上早已等於意大利的屬國，這一决正式呑倂的最大目的，是在於先發制人，趁着英·法·在巴爾幹的立足未穩，這麼一來，一面包圍了南斯拉夫，一面又威脅了希臘。執行這個計劃的，是墨索里尼，而牠的主動人，却是希特拉。有了希臘和羅馬尼亞，他們就可以有了整個的巴爾幹牛島。這時候，英·法·的大批軍艦，立刻向希臘附近集中。萬一意大利向希臘進逼的話，照當時英·法·的決心看來，爲了確保地中海上的交通，牠們是不惜和德·意·一戰的。在這裏，德·意·被迎頭堵住了。</p>
<p>於是，希特拉父再計劃着他的另一個答覆；這是——</p>
<p>（三）但澤自由市</p>
<p>希特拉原來的準備，是在四月二十九日這一天，佔領但澤自由市，作爲五十歲生日的壽禮！</p>
<p>這一計劃的醞釀，事先參加謀議最多的，是現任德外長的里本特洛甫。照他和希特拉的計劃，打算以一個「哀的美頓書一的方式，向波蘭提出幾項耍求，（這些項目後來也曾洩了出來，國內報上，大概已經登載過。）而作爲交換條件的，是訂立一個所謂「二十五年互不侵犯條的」；這一提議，他們以爲，在英·波·已業有互助協定的，現在波蘭一定會加以拒絕。一等這個被拒絕之後，立刻德國可以振振有辭地佔取但澤。假如波蘭想出而干涉的話，那末，英國政府一定會自動勸阻的。索以「英國通」著名里本　洛甫，他認定英國絕不願爲但澤一個市而作戰；因而，推尋起來，牠一定也曾勸止波蘭。</p>
<p>這一估計的是否正確，（在我個人，認爲牠是相當的厲害。）現在，因爲牠沒有施行，是無從證實了。不過，値得注意的，是牠的所以中途擱淺。這一個原因，却來自羅馬。</p>
<p>希特拉知道單單靠了文字和口頭威嚇，絕對的他貫澈不了他的佔領但澤。作爲相隨的步驟，他算計着，來一個大規模的武力示戚，在這一點上，他要求意大利的合作。可是，出於他的預料，墨索里尼却顯出了不願意的態度。意大利目前的注意點，是在於另外一些地方。（任何地方，而獨獨小是但澤。）他的暗示是，假如希特拉去佔但澤，那末，祇好德國一國去應付。</p>
<p>這麼一來，計劃被暫時擱置了，希特拉也沒有在四月二十九日那天，取到他的九十歲生日的壽禮。</p>
<p>也與上述這一計劃同時，而目前却正在加緊進行着的，作爲對於英·法·蘇·軍事同盟談判答覆的，希特拉還有他的另一個計劃；</p>
<p>（四）近東和非洲</p>
<p>大家都知道，在目前正有一個德國軍事上最重要人物布勞乞采將軍（General　Wilhelm　von　Branchitseh已經到了羅馬；最後目的地，是意屬非洲的特里波里（Tri　pli）。他這一决最大使命，是傳達希特拉的勸告，勸墨索里尼放棄他對於突尼期進攻的意思。至於墨索里尼的這一野心呢，公然地已經進行了很久，那是毫無容疑的。不過，據德國軍事人昌的意見，法國在突尼斯所做的軍事準備，實際上已經到了最高點。攻起來的話，是非常不易的。所以非常可能地可以弁假成眞，鬧出一個大戰。爲了收效來得比較大，僅僅　威脅上打算，還是對埃及來一次比對突尼斯要有把握得多。英國在埃及的軍事準備，質與量上，總大大地落在突尼斯方面法國軍的後面。</p>
<p>要想把英國注意力從中歐引開去，那末，最有效的一著，是威脅埃及，再從而威脅到蘇伊士運河。——道是納粹戰略家的一貫見解。</p>
<p>現在，據已經知道的消息判斷，大概原先已經集中在突尼斯邊境的意軍，已經開始向埃及邊境移動。而英國作爲對業的是趕緊加快解決巴力斯坦的問題。</p>
<p>據德·意·軍人的見解，假如英國不肯示弱，也在埃及從扺制　話，那來，要不了參時，德·意·就可以由利比亞直到阿比西尼亞佔領地而且通過英·埃，蘇丹成立對埃及的一個大包圍。進一問題的揭曉，什麼時候現在還說不定：不過，牠的重要性，絕不小於目前的中·東歐·問題。</p>
<p>在德·意·這些　出不窮的對英。法。的陰謀和領土擴張計劃中，最近也是最危險的，最引人注意的處所，却在於</p>
<p>（五）直布羅陀海峽</p>
<p>西班牙已絆成爲德·意·掌中物，現在，西班牙海岸，已經造成德·意·堡壘的現在，這一切，本是在預見中的。可是在目前，德·意·却並沒有忘記利用傀儡。</p>
<p>現在，德·意·兩國正在用著全付力量，對佛朗哥政府，施以很大的壓力，以他爲愧儡，去威脅英國海上交通綫的致命的一點；道一舉動，用德·意·的術語是；一把直布羅陀由英國的兵力下恢復過來！」他們的計劃，打算在五月十五日，由佛朗哥提出這一口號，同時，意大利也聲明絕對「尊重西班牙的完整。」「完整」也者，當然包括本來由西割給英國的直布羅陀。現在佛朗哥本人的態度，似乎還有一點猶豫；然而，在德·意·强力支配下，最後，大概也祇有服從的一條路。（五月五日）</p>

<p>字林報云、浦東陸家嘴英商綸昌紡織廠華工、於星期六日罷工、完全不能加以控制、並毆傷英籍堅工員一名、英艦台柯　號之英水兵一隊、乃在該廠登陸、控制惡劣情勢、防阻罷工工人、各華工於英水兵登陸後、即分散各自返家、昨（二十一日）悉、該英商綸昌漂染印花有限公司所有之綸昌紡織廠、僱用</p>
<p>華籍工人</p>
<p>頗多、彼等因電機間華工一名被辭歇、乃於星期六日將近上午九時三十分時、決計罷工、採取威脅態度、拒不離廠、局勢乃趨惡劣、午後、有英籍監工員一名、被工人圍毆、受傷而入醫院、廠方因對罷工者有完全不能加以控制之勢、決計請求保護、英艦台柯埃號之</p>
<p>水兵一隊</p>
<p>由英領事署日本事務科之湯瑪斯爲伴、乘船下駛、在濱水之該廠登陸、而改變危急之局勢、英領事署某員昨語記者云、觀於英人生命及財產受直接危害、決派台柯埃艦水兵一隊、星期六日晚在該紡織廠登陸、此舉有恢復秩序之效果、不久工人即</p>
<p>悄然離去</p>
<p>聞引起罷工之被黜僱工、因疏忽工作、不從指導、前已數加警告、因發現其激勸華工罷工、故加辭退、廠主與罷工者間之磋商、迄今未能解決此爭執、工廠房屋、已加封鎖、以待最後結果、聞廠方對被辭退者因其成績不良、將不再予僱用、該廠英籍廠主昨發</p>
<p>正式文告</p>
<p>稱、星期六日上午九時三十分、浦東陸家嘴綸昌紡織廠發生罷工、事因辭退電機間工友一名而起、其人因疏忽工作、不從指導、前已三度加以警告、一閱月前、予以最後警告、上星期五日、發現其鼓動工友罷工、乃於星期六日辭退、此舉結果、機器間與電力間工友停止工作、因截斷電力供給、故全部機器、</p>
<p>悉趨停頓</p>
<p>迄今談判未能成功、廠方對被辭退者、因其成續不良、及已寬容對待、不能重予僱用、今工廠迫不得已而封鎖、以待工人方面之更合理的態度、又英文大美晚報云、在虹口出版之日方華字報紙「新申報」今日（二十二）、稱英商綸昌紡職廠之罷工爲「華人</p>
<p>排英情緒</p>
<p>高漲之表示」、並預料上海其他英國工廠將有勞工糾紛波及、據日方見解、綸昌紡織廠中二千工人宣告罷工、乃同情於工人顧金根、其人「因俄籍司閣虐待女工、訴諸經理」、而被開除、又稱、一女工離廠時行走遲緩、而遭俄籍司閣足蹴、顧加阻勸、亦遭俄人毆擊云、據未證實</p>
<p>華方消息</p>
<p>稱、綸昌廠之罷工或未其他英國工廠工人罷工將開始之表示、此次罷工、乃日方卵翼下之「維新政府」與「大民會」所煽動。較早之華方消息稱、日方　　下兩機關、已從事煽動工人罷工、並　於把工期內對顧員沒人津貼三十元、工人每人津貼十五元、</p>

<p>袁履登先生—（續）</p>
<p>他爲紀念這筆獎學金，於是把他的原名「賢安」改爲「禮敦」，以示不忘。在他苦讀時期，又適遭到他的外王母去世，他家也是家無擔石，賴他奔走了三日，始獲安葬。到了十九歲，乃由斐迪中學保送上海聖的翰大學肄業，並以全數獎學金給其支配。二十三歲升入正館（時聖的翰尚稱書院），蒙　院長提携，命其助理化學室，月薪十五金。二十六崴卒業，回甬仟斐迪中學副校長，如是繼續在各校執敎十餘年。我們暢談至此，記者對於袁先生的刻苦求學的精神，萬分同情，可是一想到國難以來，有多少有志靑年，遭遇危難，無法繼續入學，我們該如何的惆悵　該如何的痛心？就說上海固然還可以有書可讀，可是耍辦理良好的學校同時不致使有志靑年不因家庭經濟關係而被擯校外，是一件何等難得的事，或者甚至於便是幻想。今之視昔，我們殆不勝其感喟，當時我對袁先生露出很希望他要爲目前苦難中的無力學生加以援手的態度，這個默然的要求，袁先生也黯然神傷的說是希望大家合力來切實設法。</p>
<p>袁先生帶着悲傷的口吻繼續說他服務社會的經歷，民元光復，充寗波軍政府外交兼交通决長，民二來滬，受西林岑雲階聘，赴漢充渶粵川鐵路督辦公署譯員，嗣回滬仟商務印書館經理室襄理，復佐謝蘅牕辦都樂煤礦及順昌輪公司，同時致力於各善團事業，後任奪紹商輪公司總經理。歷屆納稅華人會開會，被推爲工部局華董。最後他說，余因出身貧困，備嘗艱辛，所以持躬接物，處處以忠恕爲本，歷年來爲人覓業，爲人擔保，不遺餘力，而代人受累之事，亦無年無之，總計賠償之數，不下十餘萬元。他認爲社會上惟有互助。始克維緊，所以他說縱使賠錢，也是賠而無怨。</p>
<p>我們談了這麼多時候，我想其中有不少部份，是値得靑年們一讀的，袁先生並且說申報所貢獻於社會的，在這個時候，負責更大，因此我也就把他所說的話，的略紀載出來，貢諸讀者。　（完）</p>

<p>首飾金掛小一元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至十時十分、因烚赤破入二十元關內、故遂掛小一元、計大同行改懸二百十五元、新同行爲二百十三元、收進均的二百零七八元、</p>

<p>上週六英純金與英美滙兌俱未更動、昨本埠外滙、洋行結款甚殷、銀行供給暢達、市價穩定無變、烚赤開盤、金號賣意活躍、市况軟弱、入後殷富及銀樓業、出籠更盛價益疲弱、幸由金號趁低吸納、跌勢漸戢、下午錢兌業殷富等、供塞復盛、市價下降外幣英美金鎊、殷富出籠趨盛、需要見稀價俱下降、英金票香港票、需要甚股而微升、美金票供給較暢、法郞票需要未莊、價俱下降、荷蘭票安南票、頗有需要而堅、日金票値法幣丸角、朝鮮票値法幣八角、速日慘跌、人多注意、實因赤字公債已達高峯、不兌換紙幣增發無限、經濟原理所必然也、公會交易甚稀、僅福和祥出勤泰進安南票一百元、昨日市價、英金鎊降一角、英金票升二分、美金鎊降一角五分、美金票降五厘、香港票升三厘、法郞票降二毫半、荷蘭票安南票各升一分、其他各幣、俱無更動、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况可稱堅穩、空方略有抵補、漲勢緩慢而堅、謠傳英美又有新借款成立、人心比較興奮、大戶多頭乘機拉抬、所漲甚微、蓋以價格已高、儘力拉抬、爲勢已衰、能吾穿出三元關、尚屬疑問、收盤時聞但澤問題又趨緊張、昨日經過、午前開盤、同順同康及四號買進、洽豐聯和散戶賣出、天生進出頻仍、市價略高一二角、午後借款謠言互相傳說、毫無證實、市價再微　一二角、洽豐聯和繼續賣出、同康及四十一號亦有出脫、買戶戶多而散、結果略好二三角左右、成交總數共計五十餘萬元、茲立簡明表於後、</p>

<p>紗市轉趨上昇、且張風賡續前進、良以環境好轉、同時華南香港帮採辦復興、然額子稍增、多方心氣愈形挺秀、據云客帮目前亦在多頭地位、故生意稍旺而漲勢更强盛、汕頭帮因閩海局勢雖見緊張、二十支紗交易見淸、但三二支單紗搜羅設切、據云大都轉輾運往湘贛等處銷售之說、所以其他帮口依然呆木、委頓如常、午後聞實需不惡、人氣挺拔、二十支雙馬外棧現貨做至四百二十八元半、惟二十支冷門紗價沉悶如恒、二十支五子開三百九十元、尚賣勿出、</p>

<h3 id="c109">我的醫生生活（上） <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>屈指一計，自從出了醫學校的校門，進入社會，擔仟醫生職務以來，已足有十年的歷史了。在這說長不長，說短亦不能算短的十年醫生生活當中，的確有不少的說話可以寫出。現在我想就來寫出一些我這幾年來所感覺到對於醫生生活的特點，以及一些零雜的感想，算是我這十年來的醫生生活的一個紀念品。</p>
<p>醫生道一項職業，社會上的人們，把牠歸入於自由職業之內。自由職業這名詞的含義，我未得其詳；不曉得是吾以爲這門職業，比較其他的職業生活來得自由自在一些不是？不過，社會上確有不少的人，對於醫生這項職業，暗存羨慕的心理，把我們醫生的生活，當作非常寫意，非常美滿似的。每在高朋滿座，茶餘烟後的暢談當兒，也時常遇到談論職業生活時，對於醫生生活的欣慕贊美：「做醫生是最好不過了，只有人求己，無有己求人」，「醫生生活，是多麼自由，多麼舒服」！「醫生道項職業生活，多麼有意思呀！」……當初，就是當我自家還未做到醫生，未嘗到醫生的生活滋味時，也多少是抱有這種心理，存着這個心思。可是，待到走上了醫生的職業隊伍，嘗到了醫生的生活滋味以後，才明白了以往對於醫生的理想生活，是不眞確的：事實上，醫生生活的滋味，並非如理想中的那麼自由寫意，那麼的美滿舒服呢。</p>
<p>僅就「自由」二字來說，各種職業生活，大多除了工作事件之外，總多時空閒的了：醫生生活呢——至少一大半的醫生是如此：除了診察的工作時間從事診病工作之外，診察時間以外的時間，遇有特殊的急症，也非得來診察救治不可。半夜三更，是各項職業生活的人們，過着甜美睡夢的時間，做醫生的人，往往出乎不意，來了一個急症的病家，便要從甜美的睡夢中起來，作救治的工作。炎夏的暑天，許多職菜生活的人們，可以停止工作，歇夏避暑，醫生生活者呢，因犬熱病增，工作反而加緊忙碌。到了暑氣蒸人的夏季，醫生停了診，去避暑歇夏的是很少的。這在有形的工作方面說，醫生生活，並不如一般人所想像的那麼寫意，那麼自由。至於責任呢，因臀生的工作對象是病人，那就是負有病人生命出入的重責，其重大可知。醫治好了，那是醫生的分內責任，醫治而未愈，雖然是由於病之不治，非醫之不力與不當，有時亦要受病家的責難，允其在目前本國行翳的發生，因大多數病家對於新醫的不理解，更易發生告難醫生的事件。所以在醫生生活的本身上說，我可以應用「事繁責重」四個字來形容。</p>
<p>醫生的「事繁責重」，固是事實，但醫生在社會上所得酬報，不是比各種行業的人們，來得充裕豐富嗎？的確，社會上有許多的人們，一定把醫生這門職業，當作容易致富，容易發財的一項職菜。這個，我覺得，亦不甚然·除了少數的上層醫生的收人，比較優裕之外，大多數的醫生，允其是忠於職守而無江湖色彩的下層醫生，絲毫不比其他的職業生活的人們好到那裹。一般普通的中等醫生，在收入的成數上說，或許比普通中等社會的職業生活人員多一些，但醫生的必不可少的開支，也比校的大哩。譬如普通一位中等醫生，每月收入三百元，家中診所等等必不可少的開支，却需三百五十元，就感到不够開支之危；這還不及一位普通職業的人，每月收入二百元，而家庭等開支，只需一百五六十元的生活好多了。</p>
<p>這樣說來，醫生生活，不是成爲很無興趣，很無意味的職業生活了嗎？這父不然。除了一部份身爲形役，對於醫生生活的眞正意義，不會理解之外，至於對醫生生活發生濃郁的意義與無上的興趣的，亦大有人在。就我個人而言，我對醫生生活，可說是有濃郁的興趣的。這種興趣與意味，斷斷不是在於物質上的酬報，或以醫生生活的如何自山，如何寫意等等上頭。我的生活興味在那里呢？第一，就在於醫務工作的本身意義上；我看了一個病，診斷確實，治療正確，結果病治好了，我的精神，便獲得無上的欣慰和勝利。這種精神上的欣慰和勝利，斷非物質的酬報，所可比擬。我看到了一個病，還沒有診斷，或診斷不能確定時，不得不進一步去做尋思探究的工作，在此尋思探究病原病象的過程中，興趣便會油然而生。如其經過了深思推究而終於獲得病原，等到有了診斷時，不管對於這病治療的難易，總已有了處治的正確方針了，此時精神上，同樣地感到說不出的快慰。往下如治療的結果良好，治好了病，那眞是賽過中了慈善獎券；即使治療不好，結果終於不救，在責仟上，已對得住病人，良心上和職責上，已對得住自己了。這種精神上的勝利，良心上的安慰，實在是醫生生活者最寶貴的收穫：凡對於醫生的本身意義有深切理解的人，都能感覺得到的。</p>

<h3 id="c110">麻疹淺說 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（麻疹一名痧子又名瘄子）</p>
<p>麻疹怎樣傳染的？</p>
<p>麻疹的病原，是存在於病兒的鼻腔和口腔黏膜的分泌液和血液中的。傳染的途徑是從這病兒的口鼻分泌物直接傳播到另一健康小兒的身體上去，也有間接從健康人的媒介或病兒所用的衣服被褥器具等物散播的。傳染的能力非常强大，在發疹期允其猛烈。後來比較差些。</p>
<p>小兒易染麻疹的時期</p>
<p>普通凡生後一個月以內的小兒，傳染麻疹的較少。一歲到五歲的時期內最容易受傳染。允以滿一歲到二歲的小兒更多。到了十五歲之後，却很少。一度患過麻疹可以終　身免疫。不再傳染了。</p>
<p>一年之內，春秋二季發見得最多。</p>
<p>麻疹的病狀</p>
<p>傳染麻疹之後，經週十天光景便見發熱，發熱後三天現出疹子。熱度在發疹後四天或五天下降。所以麻疹發病的全經過可分四期。</p>
<p>（一）潛伏期　的十一天：健康的小兒，在這期中並無異狀。</p>
<p>（二）前驅期　或稱黏膜炎期，計三天到四天。這時期全身發熱，同時現結合膜炎，咽喉黏膜炎鼻黏膜炎等病狀。結果起噴嚏，咳嗽，羞明等。此時期中，皮疹雖沒有發出，但口腔黏膜，已見黏膜疹。診病上最重要的目標，是一種呌「古伯烈氏斑」的疹子。這是在發熱後一二天之內在頰黏膜正對臼齒的地方現出的小白斑，稍隆起，有紅色的圓暈圍繞着</p>
<p>和古伯烈氏斑同時或稍遲現出的是軟顎黏膜。允其是懸壅垂附近的黏膜，發出針頭大不整形暗赤色的黏膜疹。這些黏膜疹時期很短，不久就消失。並且往往缺乏而不見的。</p>
<p>（三）發疹期　到傳染後第十四天，初發部位，是耳郭後部和顏面部，起初很小，漸漸變大，最大的疹子有碗豆大小。這種發疹逐漸蔓延到頭部軀幹和四肢。發疹現出後一天半到二天，遍達全身。</p>
<p>發熱達攝氏表四十度的不少。意識有障礙，在幼兒有發痙攣的。若黏膜炎症狀愈加增惡，往往併發支氣管炎。此外有泄瀉和淋巴腺腫等。</p>
<p>（四）恢復期就是落屑期·到發疹期的終末，一二日內，體溫下降。全身症狀也見輕快。</p>
<p>皮疹的褪色，和發疹的出現順序一樣。於是皮膚落屑。（俗稱脫皮）很細小的脫落，的三天到七天完了。</p>
<p>麻疹病中，體中各臟器的黏膜，差不多全被侵害。所以各現各的病狀；大概悄形像下面：（未完）</p>

<p>（一）丙種維生素缺乏症。即壞血病。因缺乏新鮮菜蔬肉類水菓之食品。而起牙床之腐腫。口腔之潰瘍。及內外皮膜之易於出血。致皮下現出血斑。紫斑。硬塊。並全身衰弱。貧血。精神呆鈍病狀。謂之壞血症。嬰孩若僅以罐食奶粉餵養。亦要發生同樣之病。又一切熱症傳染病。允其是肺炎症。與肺癆病。人體內此素之需要激增。故在治療上亦所必要。</p>
<p>（二）甲種維生素缺乏症。各種動物脂肪。含此最多。魚肝油其一也。其他爲牛乳蛋黃。及菜蔬之綠色部分。但植物油內則無之。人體營養不足。缺少此素時。能起毛髮脫落。皮膚粗糙。指甲變壞。眼角膜眼結膜發炎。呼吸道消化器生殖器之粘膜炎腫等症。最顯著者。爲夜盲目症。肺癆患者。因體重銳减。消耗過甚。大都常服此素。藉以增加抵抗。</p>
<p>（三）種維素生缺乏症。此素爲人體內新陳代謝不可少之物體。不論老幼。均所需要。在發育期及女子妊娠泌乳期。允不可或缺。自乳母孕婦與嬰孩普遍的採服此素後。小兒之徇僂症。軟骨症。已减少百分之九十。但大多數常因營養失調。而缺乏此素。仍須大量之補充。</p>
<p>述四種維生素。爲營養之主體。其他維生素。近又發現多種。</p>
<p>戊種爲油溶性。自麥芽紛胞取出。爲鼠類成孕之要素。而在人體頗有防止流產之功。</p>
<p>己種爲酸性林諾利。爲鼠類發育期及兩性相生之要素。</p>
<p>庚種係自乙種所取出。其符號爲乙二，以前臨床家都稱能洽丕來格拉Pellefra病。但今已證明此病由於酸性尼谷丁Nicofinic　Aeid之缺乏而起。凡狗舌發黑及人體之丕來格拉。都可以尼谷丁酸治愈之。</p>
<p>辛種爲铔基酸之誘導體。鼠身缺乏此素。則起皮脂溢出性皮膚炎症。比之人體之濕疹及同樣皮膚炎症。頗有相似之關係。</p>
<p>壬種係抵抗出血之耍素。爲正常鷄血之凝固素。性耐熱而油溶。故異於甲丁戊三種。凡在碧綠菜蔬，猪肝油，大麻子，菠菜，紫苜蓿，魚肉內均包含此素。據最近報告。如以膽汁與紫苜蓿。投與出血之患者。能提高其血凝力不少。某氏以之治出血性黃疸病。曾獲奇效。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c113">「新詩」的「新」 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 彥岐</p>
<p>所謂「新詩」，在某一種觀點上看來，固然是有「新」的形式，「新」的格調，「新」的情緒，「新」的意義的詩；但是還留在普通一般人心目中的所謂「新詩」，不過是「分行寫的白話文」而已。其實「新詩」的「新」，決不單就是分行寫，或者用白話句子而言；因為「新詩」不但「新」，而且也是「詩」。</p>
<p>記得柯先生寫過一篇論詩的文章，裏面有一名話，現在還值得提出來，當新話來說。</p>
<p>他說：「一切見景，生情，感時，傷事，詠物，寄托，唱和，贈答等時，即做出，也不能算新詩了。」</p>
<p>他的意思是：在舊因圈子裏兜不出「新」的來，而「新」的東西也決不會躲在舊圈子裏面。「新詩」是從「舊詩」的舊圈子裏跳出來的；既跳了出來，當然不必再回過頭，伸一隻腳回去，以致只有新的格式，而沒有新的性質。譬如說古人寫詩愛記山林幽境的生活，這全為了他們的生活中是可以有山林幽境的生活。他們在泉旁亭裏坐著，濡筆吟詠，寫出來的當然是那樣幽閑的東西。這東西套在舊框子裏，自然就是「舊詩」。但是如果現在的詩人，也寫起隱居的幽居詩來，一看便知道是上了古人的當，落了古人的陳套了。現在我們還上那裏找能隱居的山林幽境去？即使找到了，能夠恬然幽居嗎？又能夠悠然寫詩嗎？不幸的，今日的世界不允許有這種事了。</p>
<p>不過太現實的貨色，又都是詩人目中的俗物。洋房，汽車，飛機，這些東西都被人認為是「科學的」，不配入詩！於是，「新」詩人們彷徨起來了，學古人既不合式，搬出自己這些東西又嫌俗不可耐，於是只好在女人的嘴　上轉來轉去了。而所謂「新詩」呢？格式「新」了，題材「新」了，而「新」過之後，又落入另一個「舊」境地裏去了。</p>
<p>「新」现「舊」，是「前」與「後」的代表。當我看到分行寫的「唉！我的家鄉呢！」這流句子時，我眼前只有一片「舊」，一堆「落後」。如果這也算「新詩」，那我真要懷疑起來了。</p>
<p>反之，如果寫上一首進行曲，萬一「詩」意少了，可是「新」的氣味倒也許可以多留些；那末還至少能給我一點「新」的感覺。</p>
<p>好像有人以為詩寫在外國格式上，便不新也新了。這真使我肉麻！「新詩」好容易跳出了「舊詩」的格調的樊籠，如果冉鑽進外國樊籠，其不能澈底變「新」，自是意中事了。我個人覺得，「新詩」要套上外國枷鎖，其實還不如利用詞的格調。因為既然怕沒有枷鎖會出毛病，那末何不安分一點，不必跳出固有的形式的軌道，只要在性質，靈魂方面去找「新」好了。而是時，在舊的形式，舊的格調上，不但不必拋之不顧，甚至更應該多多注意。要能在「舊」中找出「舊」，然後才能創造新的靈魂。而一味見景，生情，感時，傷事，詠物，寄托，唱和，永遠玩來玩去玩這一套，雖人是「新」人，而詩卻是「古詩」。</p>
<p>現在，引愛略特在「傳統與個人的才能」裏的幾句話來說一個清楚吧：「詩人，任何藝術的藝術家，誰也不能單獨的具有他完全的意義。他的重要以及我們對他的鑑賞就是我們對他與已往詩人及藝術家的關係的賞鑑；你得把他放在前人之間來對照比較。我認為這是一個批評的原理，美學的，不僅是歷史的。他之必須適應，必須一致，並不是一方面的；一種新藝術作品之產生同時就是以前所有一切的藝術作品之變態的複生。這個已成的規模在新作品未來時本是完全的，為的要在添新奇的東西以後繼續保持完全的狀態。整個的規模多少總得改變一下；因此每件藝術作品對於全體的關係，比例和價值又經過一番配合了；這就是「新」與「舊」的適應。」</p>

<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>『你們還有新的使命。你們今天非渡江不可，　長有船停伯在上新河，你們快支總後勤部尋。』　　部主任鎮靜而嚴肅地說。在他那副包公式的臉上，很難測度出前線的命運來。</p>
<p>『那末我們就走吧！』四正從主任芭蕉似的手掌中就接下一筆足夠維持我們這一群半年的生活費。</p>
<p>毯子，乾糧袋，熱水瓶，全部武裝起來，像只遠征的駱駝。同志們的面上沒有喜悅，沒有悲傷，神情還是那麼恬靜，別了主任同另一部的工作人員，從這大怪物口中吐了出來。無力的太陽正掛在頭頂上，是中午了，但我們還沒有想到要來幾個糖糖。出挹江門，踏上滿是蘆葦的塘沿；五六步之間就有一個深深的小坑。上面發現鷹爪，我們沒有躲避。</p>
<p>抵上新河已是傍晚的時候。它是一個臨江的小鎮，在這裏已不見有　開著門的店鋪，而老百姓卻還疏落地發現在街上。</p>
<p>『今天離開了這裏不知什麼時候再得回來？』在我們立著的對面，一　豆腐店裏的老太婆，很費力地搬著一只大缸；但她臉上卻沒有悲傷的樣子。</p>
<p>『總有一天這地方還是我們的。等著吧！』一個青年，大概是她的兒子，很活躍地幫著搬取東西，精神極興奮。</p>
<p>他們望望我們。帶著誠樸的笑容；但沒有交談。他們太忙了。</p>
<p>經過兩個小時的工夫，搜索遍了附近的小港，沒有我們一只船的影子。太陽全部給大地吞沒了，四周靜得可怕；點綴著的只有迫近的密集的機槍聲，和斷續的小炮聲。</p>
<p>『報告官長！』驀是奔來了一位滿身泥灰的弟兄，他額上的汗珠，滴滴滾下，胸前的濕了一大堆，提著槍，兀自氣喘喘地。</p>
<p>『什麼事？』</p>
<p>『請問我們的機槍連在什麼地方？　營長命令我來通知他們準備作戰，對方離開這裏只有二裏光景了……』他迅速地說著。</p>
<p>『這卻不知道，我們是　　部的；請你到前山間問，』我們表示十二分的歉意，不能給他一個答覆。</p>
<p>然而這突如其來的消息，可多麼的刺激呢。我們等待嗎？還是回城？兩個問題在每個同志的腦子中盤旋著。終於我們決定：假使中途接觸了，我們是要積極地發揮威力的。</p>
<p>遠處忽地跑來了一位黑軍服的軍官：</p>
<p>『你們是　　帥嗎？師長是不是　　　？』他瞧著我們的番號說。他挺年輕，是當地的警察局長；為了職務關係，還在這黑暗裏搜索巡邏。</p>
<p>『是的！』我們同聲地回答。話雖然是那麼簡單，但誰都充滿了熱情，心裏都懷著這樣一個共同的念頭：</p>
<p>『如果接觸了，那我們就有這位富有軍事知識的軍官同我們相互聯絡了。』</p>
<p>我們圍著他拉雜的談起來，他很熟悉我們一師的情形。</p>
<p>『——你們還是回城的好。』話講得很慢。也許他恐怕我們還沒有知道這裏的處境。</p>
<p>『回城恐怕也是不能夠的了！』帶眼的同志我們叫他小開的說。</p>
<p>『這也不一定，從這裏到水西門有一條捷徑，只須六七裏路就可抵達，』他瞧著自己的手表，『哦——七點半，從時間上計算，在你們抵達城門之前，也許城橋還沒有炸斷。』</p>
<p>他小心地告訴我們普通和特別的口令；更畫了一張間明的地圖。</p>
<p>為著我們的使命，我們就離開了他。</p>
<p>破碎不平的磚道上流動著逃難的群眾，武裝的同志。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>彥岐先生的『新詩』的『新』，投來在邢光祖先生的『新詩的辯護』之前，完全是偶然大家同時談談新詩，並非針對『新詩的辯護』而發，我應該在此聲明。</p>
<h3 id="c116">不講理 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 華父</p>
<p>人雖然是「萬物之靈」，樣樣勝過了萬物，卻可惜還沒有完全脫離「萬物」的範圍，還保全著一些「物」性，不講理。</p>
<p>不講理出之於不識字的人，編氓小民，或者野蠻人，那倒也就罷了，因為這些人本來是時常被社作「萬物」之類，而被剝奪「靈」之雅稱的，然而不幸，不講理卻一樣也會出之於讀書人，高官顯爵，或號稱文明的人，並且後者不講理的程度，似乎有時還要比前者厲害些。</p>
<p>在從前，謀佔田產，強奸婦女，包攬詞訟，實行「你的就是我的，我伯是動也動不得的」，那一個不是讀書人？「州官」可以「放火」，「百姓」不可以「點燈」；「君要臣死，不得不死，父要子亡，不得不亡」；「天下無不是的父母」；一道上諭下來，淩遲處死，而被處死者，還要三跪九叩首，「謝恩」領死。……諸如此類，不是強詞奪理」，便是傷天害「理」，比了攔路打刦，說要留下「買路錢」，全武行械鬥之前，還有茶樓「評理」，好了些什麼來？</p>
<p>現在，益發不得了了，也許果然是程度的增高吧。別有且不要說，就看看號稱最文明的國家，她們的不講理，簡直造成了新紀錄，不但空前，並且絕後，使後之來者，望塵莫及。她們動不動就要亡人之國，囊括別國的土地，蹂躪索然無辜的人民，刦奪別人的所有動產，置一切條約，協定於不顧，不情願作合「理」的商量，談判，討論，甚至對她們呼顯，哀墾，求告，也都置之不理」，吾行吾素，尤其可惡的，他們卻還口口聲聲說，這是為了和平；這是為了某一區域的安定；這是為了世界的幸福：他們的狠毒，惡辣，凶暴，真到了無可「理喻」的地步！也真像俗話所說，「李樹」是種在他們的門前的，因此，天下「有理」的，只此一定——三位一體之一家——，並無分出。</p>
<p>有一些「君子人」，自命存心厚道，以為天下「正理」只有一條，「歪理」倒有千條，他們揀多的地方走，也有他們的不得已，如果將「正理」開放一下，多添幾條，他們就不會專走「歪理」了。卻不料這樣一來，就格外壞了事：正像老虎本來不知人味，偶然有個「善心人」，看見他餓，灑些血他吃吃，他嘗到了味道，索性要吃人了；也像東郭先生，救出了中山狼，它索性要吃了他。</p>
<p>我認為這種不講理的人，頭腦是一定有毛病的；不然，為什麼他們會那樣的不顧人情天理呢？對付他們的方法，除了如醫治病人，與以吃藥打針那樣，向之作相當的勸導以外，更需要當頭的棒喝，使它們猛然醒悟，否則就只有關他們起來，聽其自生自滅。因為不講理是「蠻」的，對付真正「蠻」的人，就只好這樣。不講理是無是非之心；「無是非之心，非人也」，對付「非人」，也只好這樣。</p>
<p>「人之將死，其言也善」。善，也許可以作「講理」講。一世的姦雄曹操，畢生幹了多少不講理的事情。到他將死時，卻就有了「分香賣履」的遺囑出來，就是「善」，就是講理了。我看，現在一般不講理的，大約誰也要到死了才肯覺悟吧！</p>
<p>那末，今之「君子人，」或者「善心人」，果然要送佛送到西天，幹得徹底，還該設法促使這些不講理者，早早達到「其言也善」的地步才是！</p>

<p>— 俄國勞大畢業楊道南醫師著</p>
<p>性的神經衰弱，與一般普通神經衰弱的狀態，並無異點，第一期，為生殖器的感覺過敏，早婚，遺精，神經病，及滑精等現象，再進至第二期，則難於房事，或缺乏精液，生殖欲減退，及減少快感等症候，相繼而來。</p>
<p>所謂遺精者，即性器部分的感覺過敏，稍受刺戟，即可射精。早婚亦屬同樣的原因，大多數的結果，皆可釀成腎虧症，尤以早婚為最，差不多性神經衰弱症緾綿愈烈，其衰弱狀態，有非筆墨所可形容者。</p>
<p>性的神經衰弱，其原因大都為自瀆所致，據患者述稱，其症狀與普通的神經衰弱大體相同，例如頭重，晨起倦怠，眩暈，失眠，遺精，中心怔仲，食欲不振，其在房事時，則早泄陰痿，症狀嚴重者，有乏嗣之危險。</p>
<p>講到上述各症的一般治法，都進以滋養的補品，合於衛生的運動，避免心身的過勞，通須大便，忌用刺激性的食品，及有引用　素劑者，但無論如何引用各項各乎衛生的運勤，實不能缺少德國睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，實為一種必不可缺的藥劑，比藥為德國生理學家梅倫博士積三十年之經驗所發明，其成分除採用雄壯動物之睾丸素之外，並滲入合乎生物學標凖之礦植物名貴補質，如燐，鈣，等類是也。</p>
<p>男用「補體康」既為一種新陳代謝之劑，即使非性神經衰弱患者，若年邁之人用之，亦可期望壽登耄耋，</p>
<p>性欲工作雖屬人類應盡之責任，若過度放縱，反有害而無益，色欲過度可以減弱男子的精力，同時也使婦人疲敝，故凡縱欲之人，性神經之活動機能亦必低落，性神經之活動機能亦必低落，為預防早衰，如以「補體康」補之，頗不卓效。其女用者，功能調經種子，解除不感症，凡貧血乳　，一服即愈，此誠婦科聖藥。</p>

<h3 id="c119">驅淋之新學說 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>「驅淋」二字之義，在治淋學上，確屬值得研究之事。其故有二，一為表面之驅淋，一為全部之驅淋。局部驅淋，不過為暫時這奏效，而且每多反應。但因病家以其稍得效驗，所以多坦然不疑。及其後淋毒在內部日見蔓延，而患者之體力，反因各種不良之反應而致底抗力減少。所以往往看到有許多病家服用不良之劣藥，病家正以其得到微效時，而變症亦即在欣喜中蜂起。因之始愕然悔悟，別改他圖者有之。</p>
<p>真正之驅淋療法，必須根據淋病之真相，勿作一枝一節之方法，去解決淋病，則任何淋病，皆能一鼓除去，以免緾綿不愈。德國彼德博士即根據淋毒非特異性療法，採用蛋白體黃色素混合製成「克淋濃」。所謂非特異療法。在淋病療法中，居最超等的地位。因其服後，能昂盛淋病患者本身之細胞抗淋機能，所以此種驅淋，既極王道而徹底。舉凡急性淋時之前尿道炎，後尿道炎，睾丸炎，膀胱炎，攝護腺炎等，及由此等症之轉入慢性，續發或併發各種症狀，服用「克淋濃」絕對可以短期根本治愈。一方可外用「抗淋水」，女子淋毒白帶可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，則奏效尤為神速！</p>

<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭霆</p>
<p>攝護腺在膀胱之前，其四周環境的神經甚多，自瀆及房事過度者，致局部的神經衰弱，失其統制的機，故易於漏下，據專家的研究，所謂滑精之症，為慢性攝護腺炎的一種症狀，如淋病，膀胱疾患，房事過度，自瀆等，都能使攝護腺有發生慢性炎症的可能，患此症者，不特尿道口常有精液狀之物流出，且有種種神經的證狀。如性欲減退，早　，遺精，腎萎，背痛，頭重，腰酸，眩暈，心悸，怠倦，與恐怖觀念等。患者的性情，亦日趨於陰　沉憂，對於個人的命運，常抱悲觀，有感本人的疾病，過於重篤，精神上的活動力，因此減退，其結果往往發生悲觀。</p>
<p>本症的治療，第一在清心寡欲，以避免局部神經的刺激，至於藥物的治療，唯有服以「耐而斯遺精片」立有確效，該劑功能鞏固精關，減輕勃起神經的過敏，不論任何凶惡之遺精，滑精，服後頃刻制止，且有安靜大腦神經之功，使有常習性失眠症者，充分有獲治之機會，故其功效勝過固精片百倍，凡曾服市上各種固有精片無效者，不妨一試本品。</p>

<p>一種病，有一種療法，一病亦有二種療法，但療法之目的，皆不外要達到根本解决所治之病耳。此於他病然，淋病尤然。淋病一症，變化既繁，不可捉摸，必憑科學之方法，始可達到尋出淋病真相之目的。因此對於淋毒一症，其療法亦可對症而治，應當用內服藥療法，則用內服藥療法，應當用外治法，則用外治法，或內外兼治，則用內外兼治法，總之拍一而足。</p>
<p>單在內治與外治的方法而論，內服藥的方法以選擇藥物爲目的。此藥物必經世界著名之醫家試用介紹，方爲可靠。在此方面，爲一般人所稱贊賞用者，厥惟淋病聖劑「克淋儂」一藥爲最。查「克淋儂」一藥，其發明之原理，係根據非特異性療法，采用蛋白體黄色素混合製成。功能在服用之後，發生抗淋噬菌作用，因之此種作用能達深部之組織，因之在各部深處之淋菌，不必施以外用之手術，（實際上外用手術亦無用）而完全根本治愈。至外用療法，則德國静電，可稱爲個中翹楚。因静電療法，善於將殘留尿道部分之淋菌，掃滅净盡。故能合而用之，則兩全其美。但如僅服「克淋儂」，外用「抗淋水」，女子淋毒白帶，外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，亦能將尿道或，道之淋菌，加以徹底之掃除也。余專於淋病之學，於淋病之經騐，不可謂不多。故敢述其大意於此　診時：上午十時至下午六時。每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五月。</p>

<h3 id="c123">跑街先生 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>生意少，害得機器停着，我心中不時地倒在擔心着老闆會呌我滾蛋！</p>
<p>首先，我絕對地相信着：十個人之中，倒會有九個人將「跑街」這一項生意，目之為一種最低微，最卑污的職業的。不是嗎？『跑街先生』在社會上一般人士的心目中？正如討飯的「呌化子」一樣，他既要挨別人家的責駡，然而却又不能夠不顯出十分客氣的，謙卑的態度。他得受別人家的白眼，他得吃下那些難堪的說話……總之，我們雖然把「先生」的名詞來稱呼「跑街」的，但是，他們的生活，可真是夠算得辛苦，可憐的了。</p>
<p>你們不要瞧他們坐在白綢絲輪子，車身漆得黑黝黝的包車上，就馬上去推測，他們的生活，大概是很富裕，很舒適的。「跑街先生」果真覺得高興，快活嗎？在外表上看來，他有時候真的會被人當作是在什麽大洋行，大公司里當大差事兒似的；有時候，人們看見了他們手中提着個塞得滿滿的黑皮包，或許還以為是一個大學中的教授之流；可是在事實上，「跑街先生」是否是這樣地闊氣的呢？不，絕對的不。這部包車不是他自己的，一個「跑街先生」所有的全部產業，就只是一件污黑的長衫，與一雙有着破洞的布鞋子而已。當車子停下來的時候，他就要挨人家的罵，看人家的白眼了，那里還說得打什麽神氣，什麽闊氣。</p>
<p>「近來店中的生意，實在是太清淡了！在去年的今天，不是還很忙地動着兩部機器嗎？可是目前呢，一部機器還好像動得懶洋洋地，如此下去，試問除了關門大吉之外，還有其他的辦法嗎？」</p>
<p>老闆這幾句話，真說得我的心中忐忑地跳個不停。我雖然可以對老闆辯道，今日這種年頭，比起往年的來，實在是不能夠相同了。凡百的生意都難做，印刷業又那得不然呢？同行增多了，生意當然要被搶去不少……但是當「跑街先生」的職務，不就是用來兜生意的嗎？生意少，害得機器停頓的，在老闆的心里，大概總以為是「跑街先生」的不中用吧。</p>
<p>實際上，每一個「跑街先生」所擔的心事，正好比老闆担的心事要大得多，「跑街先生」是很知道：如果不去努力兜攬生意的話，他的飯碗是準會敲破的！</p>
<p>於是，在一無辦法的當兒，也仍舊要去找辦法！「新主顧」的確是太不容易找了，那末，還是到那些「老主顧」的地方去走走，看看有沒有生意可兜吧。</p>
<p>包車帶我拖到了每一個「老主顧」的門口：</p>
<p>「呵，先生，很忙吧！好久不見面了，近來可好？」我用了極柔和的聲音，很恭敬地，很謙卑地用這幾句話啦招呼一個「老主顧」。</p>
<p>「唔！」有氣沒氣似的回答。</p>
<p>「目前店中的生意，實在是太清淡了，先生這里可有些生意幫幫我的忙？」我繼續用了客氣的音調說。我心中就希望這一位「老主顧」能夠接着挪出許多正想要印的東西來。</p>
<p>「生意嗎？都給別人家搶去了。我倒本來打算交給你們去印的；但是別人家的價錢，可真的太便宜樂，並且，交件又來的迅速，老板看見這種情況，當然總想到便宜些的人家去引啦！」</p>
<p>這幾句回答，就像是一盆冷水，澆在我的面上，使我的心中感到了萬分的苦悶與顫抖。店裏的老闆，不是常常再罵我將價格開得太老實，太便宜嗎？他說：『這種價格，非但得不到所謂的「好處」，反而虧本倒很有希望，你下次真決不可再這樣胡亂地「減價」了。你得小心才好吶！』主顧罵我價錢太高，老闆又罵我價錢太低，真的，他們就都在向「跑街先生」進攻而已。</p>
<p>還有，印物事的人剛交給你樣子去印，他却又在催促着快些交貨了。價錢不消說得是一定要最便宜的，即時是便宜得會使老闆虧本，同時，交貨一定要「快」：那就非加開「夜工」不可呀！但開夜工要發雙工，老闆自然是很乖的，他決不會如此做，那末，無論如何地趕緊，交貨的日期總要比較原來講定的脫後幾天，結果呢，又是「跑街先生」的倒霉，挨駡而已。</p>
<p>我有時候，實在不能忍耐了，就想辭掉了這項「討飯」樣的職業，甯願不做。可是我是沒有這種勇氣的，這件工作，也是費了九牛二虎之力才找到，錢雖少，但現在家裏的妻子兒女，不就是依了這些所得在生活嗎？不能夠不做這項生意，我不能夠忍受人家的責駡與白眼……。</p>
<p>生意少，害得機器停着……我心中不時地倒在擔心着老闆會呌我滾蛋！</p>

<p>和平必須以武力維持，固屬定論，而和平準備以武力求之，真天下所創聞也。語曰「不打不成相識」，和平之獲得，真須於槍桿上領教乎？我將拭目以看和平。</p>

<p>朱村長道：『這話倒是真的！他雖然是個水竹村村長，其實村中的許多事，都由他的太太主持。本來他雖是水竹村人，却一向不住在鄉下。後來給謝阿玉結婚以後，纔住居到鄉下來，他太太說：橫豎你錢也沒有了，年紀也大了，在鄉村間隱居起來，可以不問一切了。你我也總算為國家稍盡一份子的力了，你這以後的歲月，也可以算是餘生了。他們住在鄉間，謝阿玉把這個老頭子將護得非常之好，好比一個保姆，撫育一個嬰孩似的。不想撫育撫育，真撫育出一個嬰孩來了。』朱村長這話，說得大家都笑起來了。朱愛羣道：『那位老徐村長，在家裏真同小孩子一般。連吃飯穿衣，都由村長太太照管。譬如吃飯，村長太太只許他吃兩碗，他就不敢吃第三碗。譬如穿衣，天時忽寒忽暖，他自己不大當心，村長太太隨時留意。有時他不肯穿，非得哄孩子一般哄他穿了纔休。還有老徐村長出來時，也常由村長太太陪了一同出來。』朱村長道：『這話也是真的！記得今年三月三日，我們自由村，開新村成立五周大會的時候，我們招待了鄰村三十三位村長，徐老頭子也來了。他的太太，也陪了他來。人家不知道的，還以為是孫女兒陪了她的祖父來了，誰還知道他們是夫婦呢。我見她對於老頭子的飲食起居，十分留意，真似港纔愛羣所說的，似看護小孩子一般的。我們這個會，招待了各村村長，因為有許多事，要聯合了各村舉辦的，不是一村獨有的事。好似世界各國，有國際事務，我們各村，也有村際事務。如水利，農田，衛生，教育等等，儘有聯絡各村舉辦的，因此我們也常常開這個村長聯合會議。凡是這會議席上，徐村長來，總是太太陪了來，也有時索性他不來，太太代表出席，可見太太所知道的，比他還多呢。』何雙玉道：『嘎！她是來代表村長出席，那末村長也可以由女人當的嗎？』朱村長道：『怎麼不可以呢？我們這一次三十三位村長之中，就有五位村長是女人咧。現在女人什麽事情不可以做呢？就像徐老頭子的事，不是都由太太掌管嗎！』（一一七）</p>
<h3 id="c126">再談慶餘里拆屋潮 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 才清</p>
<p>關於慶餘里拆屋糾紛，從女子銀行警告拆屋以後，虞洽卿先生調停無效，而發生勒拆毆打，斷絕水電等不幸事件，一直到現在，看來似乎沒有和平解決的希望了。</p>
<p>其實在這個鴿籠式的上海，三千餘房客在慶餘里拆屋之後，無處容身，女子銀行也是知道得很明白的，而女子銀行所以要堅持拆屋，是爲了和貧兒教養院訂立的契約關係，那末，最大的關鍵就在這裏了。正如慶餘里房客請求各界切實援救的啟事說，在這「生當亂世，疊遭浩劫」的現在，貧兒教養院是否要堅決履行和女子銀行訂立契約呢？從雙方面的廣告上看來，貧兒教養院似乎始終沒有切實站起來說過一句話。</p>
<p>自然，講法律的話，訂立的契約當然要履行，慶餘里三千多房客早該滾蛋大吉，或者投奔難民收容所去，在報上呶呶不休，都是多餘的。但是同為中國人，「生當亂世，疊遭浩劫」的凄痛境狀，雖不身受，也該目覩的了；貧兒教養院是一個慈善團體，那末，即時救濟難民，也該努力以赴，何況慶餘里的房客並不是白住的。</p>
<p>所以，希望這問題的解決，最大的權是操在貧兒教養院手裏，而從這焦點上去求答案，也是最快的捷徑；自然，我的意思是：現在大家暫時拋開法律，講一點人情。</p>

<p>設立義務小學十所　公開徵聘校長教員</p>
<p>上海自發生戰事而後，貧苦的兒童，失學的不知有多少。最近有熱心社會的人士，組織一個上海市貧兒失學救濟所，決定下學期起，廣設義務小學十數。同時，自本月二十日起，公開徵求校長，教員，登記處在愛多亞路浦東同鄉會五樓。</p>
<p>據說貧兒失學救濟所，自經馬相伯，張壽鏞，吳蘊齋，戴春風諸氏先後捐助獎學金而後，各種工作的推進，更見順利。最近更決定擴大救濟範圍，自下學期起，分上海全市為十區，每區設立義務學校十所，每校規定學額二百名，各項費用，一概不收。並定名第一區模範小學，第二區建國小學，第三區復興小學，第四區合作小學，第五區大同小學，第六區節約小學，第七區忠誠小學，第八區愛助小學，第九區信義小學，第十區和平小學。</p>
<p>救濟所方面，為集思廣益，集中人才起見，一方面分別聘請熱心教育的人士擔任籌備委員，另一方面公開徵聘熱心義務教育的人士擔任校長或教員。自這個消息傳出而後，就有好多人去索章或登記。開始登記的那天午後，筆者也到浦東同鄉會，搭了電梯直上五樓，找到了五百十九號，門口掛有「上海市貧兒失學救濟所辦公處」的牌子。走得進去，地方是相當狹小，裏面已有幾個青年男女在索取章程，填寫表格，有的更在向一位辦事的人詢問關於設立義務小學的種種。我也就問那位辦事的人，要到一份章程。</p>
<p>據說凡是對於義務教育素來有興趣的人，而在教育界服過務的，不分性別，都可填表應徵。除了照應徵表填明履歷之外，更要依照各人的特長，擬一張一週的課程表，自小學一年級起到六年級止。應徵合格之後，就由該所聘為校長或教員，而着手籌備開學事宜。將來關於校址，也由應徵合格的校長，教員負責代為找覓，每天上課的時間，規定下午五時至八時，共三小時，這樣和原有的上課時間可不抵觸了。雖然說是盡義務，但每一教員，也有每月十元至二十五元的津貼，待開學後由救濟所規定。不過應徵合格之後，還要覓具相當的保證人，以作忠實服務的保證。</p>
<p>的確，目前的上海，有着不少流離顛沛，失學和失去了父母的貧兒。今日的兒童，是他日國家的主人翁，我們不拘站在人類的同情上，或站在國家或社會的觀點上，對於這大批失學的貧兒，應得盡力的予以救濟。現在貧兒失學救濟所積極進行救濟工作，當然是失學兒童的福音，但要求獲得良好的效果，還是需要社會人士的贊助。有錢的捐錢，有力的盡些義務，才能使這件工作順利進行，將來會有意外的成績哩。</p>

<p>（一）七劍十三俠是偏軍武場的戲，天蟾舞臺有劉漢臣王桂卿高雪樵王富英董志揚這幾個路子各不相同，而無一不火爆的武生，上海人愛看火爆的玩藝兒，這齣戲這所以賣錢，這幾個武生，實在具有相當的號召。</p>
<p>（二）劉漢臣場場『卯上』，用盡氣力，賣力到底，這是任何人所不及，而最合上海一部份人胃口的。</p>
<p>（三）劉漢臣王桂卿高雪樵王富英這四個人的武工，在外行人的眼光里，是絕對難分高下的，因為都想討好觀眾的緣故，大家被好勝心所屈服，在臺上不肯絲毫松懈，唱戲的和聽戲的（尤其是同行）在臺上一別苗頭，各顯神通，自有精彩，因此而能使臺下觀眾滿意。</p>
<p>（四）七劍十三俠的劇本，編排相當緊湊，佈景彩頭亦佳，都在以前天蟾所排的『大紅袍』『八仙得道』之上。</p>
<p>因為以上幾個原因，所以七劍十三俠能夥賣錢，一家戲館排一大本錢，連賣幾個滿堂，本不稀奇，不過以向不為大眾所賞識的劉漢臣，而在天蟾舞臺掛起頭牌，竟然有如此驚人的成績，倒是值得來研究一下的。</p>
<h3 id="c129">『舞女淚』及其他 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 維克</p>
<p>—星期劇場觀後感</p>
<p>這一星期日上海劇藝社的星期實驗劇場，由上海交誼社演出了三個獨幕劇：一是章泯作的『雪夜小景』，一是上海劇社的集體創作『舞女淚』；第三個是田漢改編的『母親』。</p>
<p>這次後臺的燈光，佈景，道具，化裝等，則仍然由上海劇藝同人負責。</p>
<p>上海劇藝社的演員，如夏霞，藍蘭，張婉君，舒湮，屠廣圻，丁芝，徐立，周起等也都在座。現在讓我們來談談三個戲的演出情形吧：</p>
<p>（一）『雪夜小景』——這是一個獨幕劇，而且也只有一個演員，它正和『早點前』一樣。當一個演員，要支撐一個舞臺面的時候，這是比較困難的，如若劇作者所寫下的故事與對話太樸素，太簡單，或是導演對於這場戲的氣氛，（燈光，樂，演員的地位，聲調的高低，動作的快慢）抓不住，那么這一個獨力支撐的大廈，一定會使觀眾感覺寂寞而空洞的。</p>
<p>『雪夜小景』有著一種新型的寫法，幾乎是用了漫畫的筆觸，淡淡的勾上幾筆雪夜，貧苦的母親，沒有錢，沒腿，痛苦地把孩子送進育嬰堂去·情緒是相當悲慘的，但是這僅僅是一首小詩，而不成為一個好的故事的。</p>
<p>因此，它給觀眾的印像，是冷寞而且空洞的。</p>
<p>導演對於這唯一演員的地位，也放不開，始終任她站在一個角上，這也是不好，演員葉琦，是能夠演戲的。</p>
<p>（二）『舞女淚』——劇本和前次舞女們自己演出的已經不同，尤其是加強去寫曼麗打胎以後，牠的舞客小陳還來和牠嘔氣說明不和牠結婚，曼麗的哭，笑，燒照片，撕假的存摺等，使全劇增加力量不少。</p>
<p>三個戲中，應該以『舞女淚』算最好的了。</p>
<p>演員中，飾曼麗的尹藍為最成功；導演也在曼麗狂笑聲中，處理得很有力量；悲愴，悽涼，怨恨，憤怒，尹藍是把握住這樣的個性的。在燒照片火光熊熊中間，音樂聲繼之而起，悲愴的氣氛異常強固。其餘幾個演員，都很老練。如夏雯的曼麗，沈墨的母親等。飾琳琳的尹青，說話缺乏情感，甚至於不懂怎樣念臺詞；發言也太低，如她對曼麗訴述她到香港去受舞客欺騙一段對白，可以看出她缺乏經驗。</p>
<p>（三）『母親』——故事是說舊俄時代，一個作母親的，常常受三代的期辱與痛毆，後來總算她獨生子覺悟了，用了新的力量拯救了一向被男子欺凌的母親。</p>
<p>劇本是很有力量的，但因為幾個主要演員太軟弱，以致使整個戲軟綿無力。</p>
<p>尤其是飾父親米哈爾的，他雖然粗暴地在臺上咆哮著，但他卻缺乏情感，如他的笑聲，他的痛毆妻子，以及發音忽高忽低，使這個戲通盤都失敗了。</p>
<p>柏李的母親，是演得很沉痛而細膩的，她的畏怯，恐怖，悲痛，都能抓住在男子暴力下生活的女子底特性。</p>

<p>毛世來二度來滬，偕沙世鑫高盛麟等在黃金登臺，以佳座難得，直至第三日毛演鐵弓緣，始克往觀。是晚適值鶴唳風聲，鐵網密佈，黃金提早開鑼，愚八時入座，閻世善之出手，與高盛麟八大鎚之車輪大戰，俱未寓目。所得見者，沙世鑫高盛麟之斷臂，毛世來江世玉艾世菊裘盛戎等之鐵弓緣兩折而已，世鑫扮相清癯，作工亦矜平躁釋，不若富英之瘟，而略有連良之雋。惜嗓音細弱，尤甚於周嘯天，僅前數排能辨其行腔吐字，後排祇能見其動作。砍臂時之吊毛，乾凈輕捷，惟臂未擲起，為美中不足。盛麟之陸文龍，扮相略欠俊朗，作工唱唸，稱職而已。坐聆王佐說書一場，頻頻理其衣襟，態似跼　，不識何故。</p>
<p>毛世來之鐵弓緣，上度來滬，膾炙人口。此番出演，彌益洗煉。嗓音亦較前爽亮。一年小別，便當刮目相看。是劇十分繁重，面其要點，上半折重在試弓聯姻，須演得風情旖旎·下半折易釵而棄，以旦角反串小生。世來演來，自始于終，無懈可擊，愚尤愛其下半折之的扎　戲，起霸開打，道白神情，胥能一洗花旦扭捏之習，真假正甫剛相遇，同時兼操兩種嗓音，對其母係旦角白口，對王則易為小生語調，剛柔陰陽，往復變換，此乃特長，臺下鼓掌，愚亦報彩焉，</p>
<p>毛之配角，小生江世玉飾匡忠，氣度從容，發音清亮，雖略遜葉盛蘭，亦不可多得之材。丑角艾世菊，於試弓緣聯姻一場，異常吃重，演來嫻熱無疵，博彩極多。凈角裘盛戎，為裘桂仙子，體格面貌，似欠魁悟，嗓音則甜潤如劉連榮，亦美材也。飾王大人之鬚生貫盛習，本係里子，是夕因世鑫嗓低，盛習嗓亮，亦博得不少彩聲焉。</p>

<p>義伶羅葵舫生前有兩事足述</p>
<p>二人方在爭論間，忽見某太太步入室中，小婢乃匆匆退出。小寶本與某夫人熟極，有時某爺公出，夫人亦時來周旋數語，故見夫人進內，亦不以為意。不過今天的情形與往日不同的，第一是夜深主人未歸，第二是突命小婢贈金，第三就是當他三番兩次要辭去的時候，夫人總是極力攔阻說某爺少時就回，有電話來請你少候，看看已經深夜三四點　啦，而某爺還不返寓，他難再三催促睦人歸房早睡，容他一人在此恭候，可是夫人又置之不理，後來居然躺下來要代他裝煙，他如何敢領受呢？再過一會，夫人竟立起身來，走去閂門，小寶本是個聰明人，甚麼不懂，這時他心中忐忑不定，暗想某爺待他何等恩厚，即夫人亦是大家閨秀，平日也對彼十分優待，今天她以一念之差，竟頓起邪念，本也是婦人或有之事，但是我羅某決不能與她一樣的糊涂，趁她方在把持不定，尚未有所舉動之前，不如預籌個金暗脫殻的法子，速解此圍為是。想罷之後，他故意裝了兩大筒煙，呼呼接連抽下，馬上立起身來，就說頭暈，並且作出站立不穩的樣子來，夫人不顧一切，用手來拉他睡下，說躺一會就好啦，就在這時，小寶突然一個筋斗摔倒在地，登時閉了氣，口吐白沫，　髴是羊癲瘋的舊病復發了。夫人知他本有此癥，又瞧他頭也跌破，血流如注，她當時也嚇昏啦，急忙把門撬開，喚進僕婢們來，用車子把他送到醫院診治，這一場懸虛，就此風消雲散。過了幾日，小寶仍舊登臺演戲，額角上還貼著橡皮膏藥，這就是此事的一個紀念，後來某夫人明白過來，格外敬重他的為人，似小寶這樣自救救人的急智，和他那種知恩報德，不淫人家室的義行，別說伶界里並不多見，即令在現今這種惡社會里，也是很不多有的呢。他幼年時既能自爭人格，不愿作人玩物，所以後來就更不敢玩弄女性，一個人前後的行為，都是有連帶關係的。他這人可惜死得太早啦，倘是晚死幾年，就單靠灌灌唱片，教授戲劇，也可以收入甚豐。再者說他的譚派戲，的確真夠味，凡是想過過戲癮的，既是聽不到叔巖的唱，在上海就可常常聽他幾齣拿手戲，解解饞，何況他有的地方，還比叔巖略高一籌呢。——（十八）——</p>

<p>女性是最喜歡把自己的年齡縮短的，縱使容貌上的美色已經成了不容諱飾的鐵證，她們仍然違心地少說幾歲，方才感到痛快似的。從這點上，可以體察出女性們對於怕老心理的同病。原因是，女為悅已者容，誰不希望在脂粉下顯出自己的美麗和青春呢？然而好景不長，在歲月頻頻轉換下最易老去的便是短暫的青春，於是等到詔華消逝，美色衰馳，明知自身的黃金時代已經度盡，卻依舊勉強歡笑，竭力在人前把自己的年齡七折八扣，徒自安慰。</p>
<p>中國的女皇們，當然也無法不犯上說的弊病！她們多數女人要保留青春，男人何獨不然。（編者按：一老，）誰愿意呢？疏忽了自身的立場，不知在藝術上爭取地位與聲譽，而一味地在美色上去炫耀觀眾，好像年年要觀眾把她們視為祇是十六歲的小姑娘一樣！實則呢？觀眾不是瞎眼，雖然她們經過化裝美容後在銀幕上影映出來的幻像要年輕得多，可是不斷地在增加起來的歲月，決不會不在女星們的容顏上留下痕跡的。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chen Cheng Confident of China's Victory: The Worst Period is Over; Japanese Troops Ambushed in the Dahong Mountains and Surrounded Near Zao City; Chinese Troops in Hubei Province Approaching Jingshan and Fiercely Attacking its Suburbs; Chinese Troops at Pengze and Hukou Recapture Taiping Pass and Shijianpu <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) General Chen Cheng, currently commanding the battles in Jiangxi-Hunan and northern Hubei, and considered one of China's capable generals, received news reporters here this afternoon and declared: "We do not expect to win this year or next year, but if we continue to fight for three to five years, we will ultimately achieve final victory." Reviewing the battle situation, the general said that not only are the Japanese troops unable to make any further progress, but they are also trapped by Chinese troops within their occupied areas. In the areas behind the Japanese front lines, in addition to guerrillas and mobile units, there are still as many as sixty divisions of regular Chinese troops. The Japanese troops in northern Hubei concentrated three infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade, namely the troops of the 33rd and 16th Divisions, in an attempt to encircle the Chinese troops under the command of General Tang Enbo. However, after five days and nights of fighting in the scorching sun, the Japanese encirclement plan has failed. Currently, Sun Lianzhong and Liu Ruming's troops are stationed in Xinye, and one army corps under the command of General Liu Heding is stationed in the Dahong Mountains. The Japanese troops can no longer advance towards Xiangfan. As for the Nanchang war zone under his command, since the Chinese troops repelled the Japanese troops in Wuning, the Japanese troops have been unable to invade Hunan Province. Chinese troops even launched a counter-offensive against Nanchang on April 22nd. Although they failed to recapture the city, several hundred men twice charged into the city, but unfortunately, they could not establish a foothold inside the city. The main purpose of the Chinese counter-offensive against Nanchang was to support the defending troops in northern Hubei and prevent the Japanese troops from moving from Jiangxi Province to the Xiangfan area. Although the Japanese troops have cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Chinese troops can still maintain transportation through the more southerly highways and coastal areas. The Japanese troops currently have thirty infantry divisions and three cavalry brigades distributed in the following locations: a total of three divisions in Guangdong and Hainan Island, two divisions in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway area and southern Anhui, five divisions in Jiangxi-Hunan and northern Hubei, three divisions in the Xiangfan area, plus one cavalry brigade, two divisions in northern Anhui and the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, four divisions in northern Jiangxi, the Jinpu and Shandong Railway areas, three and a half divisions in Hebei-Chahar, two divisions in eastern Henan and the Daoqing Railway area, five divisions in Shanxi Province, and two divisions in northern Shanxi and Suiyuan. China's most difficult period has now passed. The general frankly admitted that China's most critical time was at the beginning of the Lugouqiao Incident. At that time, there were different opinions in North China regarding the issue of war and peace. It was decided after the fall of the capital that China had suffered a terrible loss in this battle. If the Japanese troops could not inflict a decisive defeat on the Chinese troops in the battles to capture Nanjing and Hankou, then this opportunity would never come again. The general concluded, "China will surely achieve final victory, this is only a matter of time." (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) General Chen Cheng declared today that Japan is currently encountering four major problems in the occupied areas: a lack of time, labor, capital, and political and social stability. It is said that Japan's financial resources have been exhausted and it is unable to develop the occupied areas. The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan and Germany's Four-Year Plan both require huge amounts of capital to be implemented. Japan currently lacks the financial resources, so Japan will never be able to develop China's resources to conquer China. According to custom, it takes three to five years to make a profit after investing in the development of any land. It has been eight years since Japan invested in the three northeastern provinces, but it still cannot gain any benefits. Furthermore, if Japan wants to use China's resources to conquer China, it must first consider the issue of "time." At present, the number of Chinese laborers helping Japan is extremely small. Chinese workers are unwilling to cooperate with Japan or help Japan develop China's resources, so it is impossible to maintain political and social stability in the occupied areas. The Japanese occupation of Nanchang is militarily beneficial to the Chinese troops, because thereafter the Chinese troops do not need to defend the areas south of the Xiu River, which can allow the Chinese troops to avoid attacks from certain directions. The Japanese troops are currently engaged in defensive battles in a vast area, because their strength has been greatly reduced due to the attack on Nanchang. Furthermore, we have occupied certain points on the railway between Nanchang and Jiujiang, so Japanese transportation is very inconvenient. The railway between Zhejiang and Jiangxi has been cut off, but the highway is still open. In addition, the Chinese troops south and east of Nanchang are self-sufficient and have now been reorganized into mobile units. The Chinese counter-offensives towards Gao'an and Nanchang have prevented the Japanese troops from achieving their goal of encircling the Chinese troops north of Hubei and south of Hunan. Now the strength of the Japanese troops has been greatly damaged, and the Chinese troops are taking the opportunity to counterattack at certain points. Therefore, the power of the counter-offensive is completely in our hands. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Guilin) On the 21st, more than two hundred Japanese troops attacked the Chinese position in Gaoyou City, and the fighting was very fierce. The main force of the Chinese troops was transferred to the southern bank area. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese troops who collapsed from Zaoyang fell into a trap set by Chinese guerrillas in the Dahong Mountains and are unable to extricate themselves. They have been repeatedly annihilated by Chinese troops in recent days, and their losses have reached half. After Chinese troops recaptured Zao City, the remaining Japanese troops were still surrounded and attacked by Chinese troops near Zao City on the 22nd. Judging from the fact that the Japanese troops were forced to retreat to Suizao and that a large number of reinforcements have recently arrived from Wuhan, it can be concluded that the Japanese troops' decision to invade northern Hubei has resulted in serious consequences for them. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Shashi: After Chinese troops recaptured Wamiaoji and Yanmenkou, they have launched attacks towards Yonglong River and Lujiazhai in recent days, capturing many enemies. Currently, communication between the Japanese troops in various places has been cut off by Chinese troops. In addition, Chinese troops have been advancing towards Jingshan in recent days and occupied Lanjiaji yesterday, annihilating several hundred Japanese troops. They are now approaching the suburbs of Jingshan and fiercely attacking the city. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Fuliang: The battles between Pengze and Hukou are currently developing. On the 20th, Chinese troops launched a large-scale attack on Taiping Pass and recaptured the area, and then took advantage of the victory to recapture Shijianpu. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in confusion towards Yangjiashan, Dingshan, and the riverside. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: Chinese guerrillas attacked the Japanese troops in Xishan Wanshou Palace on the night of the 20th, inflicting heavy casualties on them, and destroyed a large bridge east of Wanshou Palace. On the morning of the 21st, dozens of Japanese troops took three cars to reinforce, but were also repelled by Chinese troops. The guerrillas near Niuhang on the Chinese side have been very active in recent days, launching frequent attacks and capturing many enemies. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Shaoguan is currently evacuating its population and supplies and taking all necessary measures to prevent indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes. Chinese troops are heavily guarding Xiangshan and Guifeng Mountain west of Xinhui City. Artillery battles were still in progress on the morning of the 22nd. More than two hundred Japanese artillerymen and more than five hundred infantrymen from Jiujiang left for Jiangmen yesterday to reinforce. In addition, Japanese troops have been shelling the coast along Heshan for days to prevent Chinese troops from crossing the river in the rain to launch a counter-offensive. (Special dispatch, 11:00 PM, 22nd)</p>
<p>Sihui: The Japanese troops in Jiangmen are constantly sending reinforcements to Xinhui. On the 19th, more than thirty Japanese troops landed from a small motorboat along the Mei River between Jinniushan and Fenjiang outside the west gate of Xinhui and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese guard troops. In addition, a part of the Chinese troops advanced to the north gate of Xinhui on the morning of the 19th. The Japanese troops are stubbornly resisting behind solid fortifications, and fierce fighting is in progress. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

They occupied the high ground at the western end of Donggoudi. More than one hundred Chinese commandoes took advantage of the momentum to rush into Chengjiazhuang, engaging in melee combat several times. Most of the one hundred Japanese defenders were annihilated. At this time, the Chinese artillery also exerted its power, and two Japanese artillery pieces in Donggoudi and on the high ground were destroyed by Chinese troops. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e5">No Change in Situation at Gulangyu; Discussions on Troop Withdrawal Have Not Reached a Compromise; Director of Refugee Camp Arrested, Schools for Refugee Children Closed; Residences of Chinese Staff at the Municipal Council Also Invaded by Japanese Soldiers; America Prepares to Defend All Rights and Deal with Any Aggression <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Gulangyu: According to indirect information from here, the Chinese arrested by Japanese sailors after landing in the public concession here and taken to Xiamen have been subjected to severe torture. The exact number of those arrested is unknown, but it is generally believed to be around two hundred, including one British-Chinese citizen. The British authorities immediately tried to rescue him, but he was only released after several days. A doctor's examination revealed that he was covered in wounds from torture. The situation here is currently still deadlocked. Britain, France, and the United States continue to station 42 sailors each, the same number as the Japanese sailors. It is said that discussions on simultaneous troop withdrawal have been in progress, but it seems that no compromise has been reached so far. The stationing of British, American, and French troops here has clearly eased the tense situation, but without the withdrawal of Japanese soldiers, it is difficult to restore normalcy. The Japanese side cited the assassination of Hong Lixun, the "president of the Chamber of Commerce" in Xiamen, as a pretext for sending troops to land. It has not yet been proven whether this assassination was directly motivated by politics. The landing Japanese soldiers have searched house by house, but have not captured the murderer. The Japanese military search teams went directly into Chinese houses, causing schools for Chinese refugee children to close one after another. The director of a refugee camp housing 6,000 people was arrested by the Japanese military. The staff in the camp were greatly frightened, and the relief work was also affected. The residences of the Chinese staff of the Gulangyu Municipal Council Police Department were also invaded by Japanese soldiers. It is generally believed that these Chinese staff members are quite discouraged by this kind of threat. It is said that there were also incidents of illegal invasion of British property by Japanese soldiers. The British authorities are currently compiling a detailed report on this matter. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to reports from here today, the Gulangyu Municipal Council authorities arrested four so-called pro-Japanese Chinese and originally planned to deport them today. However, the Japanese consul interfered. The Japanese consul is currently negotiating with the Gulangyu authorities for the release of the four pro-Japanese Chinese. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Senator Pepper, a Democrat representative from Florida and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared that recent developments in the Far East have made the United States prepared to defend all its rights to deal with any aggression. He also said that Japan's decision not to continue occupying Gulangyu may improve relations between the United States and Japan. He predicted that Japan would continue to pursue a "sensible and rational policy" in the future. He further expressed his deep belief that Japan would abandon its idea of unilaterally abolishing the treaties. An improvement in relations between the United States and Japan would reduce the pressure to pass the Pittman Amendment to the Neutrality Act (embargo of goods ordinance).

<h3 id="e9">The German-Italian Alliance <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Just as the British and Soviet Union were tirelessly engaged in so-called 'counter-proposals' and 'compromise plans,' with negotiations progressing almost in a state of semi-sleep, Germany and Italy yesterday completed the formal procedures for concluding an alliance, signing a political and military treaty. The seven articles of the alliance are simple and clear. The content it contains itself does not have any new significance compared to the year-long collusion between the two countries. However, its objective significance ironically mocks the British-Soviet negotiations.</p>
<p>Hitler and Mussolini waved the false banner of anti-communism to conceal the true face of aggression. They previously launched aggression with profound determination; now they express their determination with a public alliance. Since the Munich Agreement, the European balance of power maintained by Britain's traditional policy has been completely destroyed. Chamberlain's policy of 'appeasement,' which condoned Germany and Italy, fundamentally overturned the traditional European balance of power of the past century. According to Chamberlain and Daladier's plans, they originally wanted to dismantle the collusion between Germany and Italy through concessions at Munich—to deepen their conflict in Central Europe; they wanted to open the door for Hitler's eastward advance at the expense of Czechoslovakia. They hoped that Hitler would be satisfied in Central and Eastern Europe and would turn around and fulfill his promise of 'eastward advance' announced in 'Mein Kampf.' However, today, the 'appeasement' policy has finally completely failed. The alliance signed yesterday at least confirms the failure of the dismantling policy. Future eastward advances, westward advances, and even southward and northward advances, await democratic countries to give him appropriate opportunities.</p>
<p>Hitler is not a fool. He knows the power of the Soviet Union. He gleaned many meanings from Stalin's report at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party. At least for now, he will never attack the Soviet Union head-on. Originally, in Hitler's speeches several times this year, he had revised 'Mein Kampf.' He openly demanded colonies, which was not mentioned in 'Mein Kampf.' He also repeatedly stated that 'in any war, Germany will stand with Italy.' All of this clearly has a strong anti-British connotation. 'Mein Kampf' was not anti-British. However, the victory of Fascist blackmail and their 'achievements' in Spain have unveiled a new stage in the severe European situation. The German-Italian military alliance is a more public and superficial manifestation of this severe situation. Britain has become their most direct target. Berlin's recent active construction of a navy proves that Hitler pays more attention to Britain and France than to the Soviet Union. All clever attempts to dismantle the German-Italian axis have proven to be a waste of imagination. Peace cannot be established with a 'appeasement' policy aimed at dismantling them. A firmly established universal peace can shatter their common will to aggression!</p>
<p>In this situation, the British people and public opinion are increasingly awakening and feel the need to urgently cooperate with France and the Soviet Union to establish an anti-aggression front. The British-Soviet negotiations were produced under the impetus of this force. However, Prime Minister Chamberlain may not have the determination to thoroughly cooperate with the Soviet Union, and he has not given up the illusion of compromise with Germany and Italy. Frankly speaking: he still wants to carry out his old policy in this new direction. He wants to use the British-Soviet rapprochement as a weapon to coerce Hitler. He wants to impose heavy unilateral obligations on the Soviet Union to achieve his attempt to 'buy the casket and return the pearl.' Therefore, although Britain has repeatedly proposed 'counter-proposals' and 'compromise plans,' the British-Soviet talks have not made much progress.</p>
<p>The German-Italian military alliance has finally been formally signed. The semi-sleep state in the British-Soviet negotiations may awaken due to ridicule and irony. For the sake of universal anti-aggression and universal peace, we hope that the British-Soviet negotiations will immediately awaken and catch up. However, our hearing and sense of smell simultaneously detect an anesthetic and hypnotic atmosphere. Although the German-Italian alliance has no new meaning, the broadcast speeches and talks with reporters by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano after signing the alliance and drinking champagne (all seen in today's news column, Berlin dispatch) revealed a lot of temptation in a fierce and weak tone. They breathed a gentle breath on Chamberlain's appeasement policy and Roosevelt's call for peace. This is enough to anesthetize and hypnotize those who are indecisive and have an unclear understanding. Chamberlain wanted to dismantle the German-Italian axis long ago, but did not succeed. And Germany and Italy are using their method to treat their person, and the speeches and interviews after yesterday's signing may not want to interrupt the British-Soviet negotiations. Of course, Chamberlain is old and sophisticated after all, and he is not a fool after all.</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) The islands of Kinmen and Xiamen in southern Fujian are isolated at sea, resulting in their invasion. The residents along the Chinese coast have been in pain and anger for a long time. Xu Tieqiong, Chen Dayuan and other [illegible] people recently organized a brave suicide squad, who, on the evening of the 20th of last month, took advantage of the dark night to board boats and cross the sea to carry out the first brave act of a surprise attack on the Japanese troops on Kinmen. That night, the moon was dark and the tide was surging. It took four hours to cross the Kinmen coast. After landing, they immediately divided into three teams. One team was responsible for sabotage and ambush to create a diversion. One team went straight to the red western-style building in Guan'ao, which was occupied by the Japanese troops. They immediately stabbed and killed the Japanese sentry and rushed to the ground floor, concentrating their firepower. The sound of Mauser pistols, machine guns, and grenades went off at the same time. The Japanese soldiers were awakened from their dreams and desperately fought back. In the dark, most of them were annihilated by the Chinese. As the Chinese side withdrew, they could still hear the screams of women in the building. The third team sneaked to the southeast corner and, with agility, rushed into the No. 10 barracks of the Japanese troops at the branch office. They immediately killed 14 Japanese soldiers and destroyed their artillery and supplies, and withdrew in an orderly manner. They boarded the boats together. After they were far from the shore, they heard heavy gunfire on the island. The Chinese side had already returned in triumph. The total spoils of this raid included two machine guns, six rifles, two steel helmets, two Japanese flags, six bayonets, six military uniforms, 142 rounds of ammunition, and many other symbols and parts. The Japanese soldiers killed by the Chinese were from the 2nd and 4th companies of the Sasebo 2nd Special Naval Landing Force, Western Detachment. Those whose names could be verified included "Itaizumi," "Hasegawa," "Yoshinari Kazuno," "Hayashibe Zo," "Ito," etc., all first-class sailors. The Japanese troops annihilated inside and outside the western-style building were not included. The Chinese side only lost two men, Zheng Liang and Zheng Bian. Chinese commanders, upon receiving the report, have given commendations and provided for the families of the fallen soldiers, to encourage loyalty. (Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>(Changchun) According to official news revealed here today, a squadron of Outer Mongolian bombers flew into "Manchukuo" territory on May 20. One of them was shot down by "Manchukuo" machine gunners. It is said that the incident occurred near Lake Balnur. All the people in the plane were killed, but the number of those killed has not been announced. It is also said that border disputes between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia have been increasing recently. Prior to this case, there was another border crossing incident on May 15, when Outer Mongolian troops crossed the Khara River east of Lake Balnur and began building fortifications inside "Manchukuo." They were then severely damaged and driven back by the joint Japanese-"Manchukuo" forces. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Chongqing: Establishment of a New Type of Refugee Camp Allows Displaced Victims to Quickly Restore Their Past Lives <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Four hundred refugees here, most of whom are children, today established a new type of refugee camp with funds allocated by the Chinese Refugee Relief Committee. The difference between this refugee camp and other refugee camps is that it is based on self-sufficiency. The purpose of establishing such a refugee camp is to allow displaced refugees to quickly restore their past lives. The refugee camp is located in a temple. The women in it spend all day sewing, and the men mostly engage in sawing wood and hammering operations outside the temple, building new houses. Cadres of the New Life Movement are arranging workshops so that the refugees' machinery and tools can be placed there. The refugees here receive a daily food allowance of 15 cents. In addition to vegetables, their diet occasionally includes meat. At the same time, the authorities are deeply concerned that unsanitary food will easily spread diseases, so they are extremely cautious about cooking and have hired a doctor to prepare for unexpected illnesses. Although these refugees have lost contact with their families, they are happy as usual and have no worries. According to the cadres of the New Life Movement, allowing refugees to have work can not only give them a sense of self-esteem for independent living, but also prevent them from worrying about their experiences. What is most gratifying is that the children among them, although mostly orphans picked up on the road, are able to work hard and make a living. At the same time, the New Life Movement has also established many children's schools to enable children to learn to write. Furthermore, all children are under the care of government personnel from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. They have three hours of classes every day and form boys and girls scouts, giving them patriotic education and teaching them various skills.

<h3 id="e13">General Li Zongren Discusses the Current Military Situation; Described by a Reuters Reporter; China Has Not Yet Planned a General Offensive; Aims to Deplete Japanese Forces; Japan Sinks Deeper and Deeper into the Mire; Deriving No Lasting Benefit <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>In a certain area of Central China, a reporter recently met General Li Zongren at his secret war zone headquarters, where he was informed of the current military situation in China, with particular attention to the situation in Northern Hubei. Li first stated, "I fear I cannot bring much good news. We cannot tell you when we will recover Hankou or begin a general offensive. We are determined to defeat the Japanese, but we are not planning any general offensive, only continuous small-scale attacks to deplete Japanese forces without overusing our own strength. To date, the Japanese army has been unable to break China's national strength, and now there are few opportunities to do so. The Japanese army can indeed occupy towns, but as they advance, the land they occupy behind them is recovered by Chinese forces." Li then cited the Dabie Mountains as an example, saying that before the Japanese army occupied Hankou, they had occupied many places in those mountains. When the Japanese army advanced towards Wuhan and Nanchang, these many places were all retaken by Chinese forces. When the Japanese army withdrew from Nanchang to Hubei province, Chinese forces rushed to the vicinity of Nanchang, recaptured Gao'an, and have now surrounded Nanchang. Li continued, "If the Japanese army stops attacking, we will attack, regardless of victory or defeat. In order to maintain its position and maintain the trust of its people, Japan will inevitably attempt to advance, but what it gains will only serve to exhaust its strength further, with no lasting benefit to speak of. The Japanese have not been effective in controlling our natural resources and manpower. The Japanese army is trapped in a mire, sinking deeper and deeper. The Japanese army came with great force, but is now visibly weakening, while China is becoming more united and organized. The Japanese army in China totals more than thirty divisions, but they are all scattered in various places, subject to harassment by Chinese guerrillas and regular forces, even in the suburbs of Shanghai. I only use one-third of my troops on each front, while the rest continue to be trained and recuperate in the rear. This ratio remains constant, so although our army's equipment is inferior to the Japanese army's, its efficiency is growing daily." Li continued, "China's resources are now being consumed by the war, and may be exhausted by the end of the war, but the Chinese people are determined not to be slaves of Japan, or to sacrifice themselves, their children, and their freedom to make peace with Japan. Our suffering and burdens are beyond words, but no one in the country is asking for peace talks. We have lost Hankou, which many people thought could not be lost, but we are still fighting with unwavering determination." Li also stated that four divisions of Japanese reinforcements have now arrived on the front lines of Northern Hubei, and may be used to attack Xiangfan. Although the Japanese army attacks regardless of losses, and Chinese forces are forced to retreat, Japan will pay a heavy price in casualties for what it gains, which will not only fail to strengthen its position, but will only create temporary victory news for Japanese newspapers. Li also issued a sincere warning to the other countries of the world about the consequences of allowing the war in the Far East to continue and failing to take any measures to stop the aggression. He said, "During the September 18th Shenyang Incident, I gave a speech at a banquet, warning British diplomats and naval personnel of the possible consequences of the Japanese attack. What I said has now been proven correct. I wonder if anyone who was present at the time still remembers it. We are now doing our utmost to cope with the war. Other countries can help us with very little cost to themselves, but with great help to us. We need a small amount of money, and we need technical assistance to make up for our military shortcomings." After Li finished speaking, he asked the reporter about the latest news from Europe, and expressed his firm grasp of the various political and military strategic issues in the current European situation. Like most of his countrymen, Li tended to predict the possibility of a Second World War and its impact on the war in the Far East. Li further expressed his opinion that Europe is in great danger of war breaking out in the next two years due to Germany's increasing autocracy, and believes that the handling of the Far East situation by the democracies will have a major effect on European affairs. Li concluded, "I hope that the world can obtain peace, but the democracies need more far-sighted politicians than they currently have." (Reuters special correspondent, 7th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Yu Youren reported on the Central Memorial Week on the 22nd, with the theme "Congratulations on the Production Conference." The main idea was that the flames of the War of Resistance over the past two years have forged the scattered Chinese nation into steel. Production should turn this steel into a huge machine. The recently convened production conference is the motor that starts this huge machine. At the conference, the President's instructions, President Kong's speech, and the suggestions of various experts have already shown us the highest principles and implementation steps for our production and construction. This is the harvest of this production conference. He concluded by saying, "War is cruel, but it is also the mother of culture. Therefore, I hope that scholars, experts, and all working compatriots across the country will be mobilized in spirit, work hard to produce, and strive to create a new China of culture, which will soon arrive."

<p>(Tokyo) According to Colonel Hashimoto, who shelled the British gunboat "Ladybird" in the Yangtze River in December 1937, the war Japan is waging in China today is not only a war between Japan and China, but also a war between Japan and Britain. Hashimoto recently returned here from the front lines in China, and told reporters from the Kokumin Shimbun yesterday that Britain, like China, is Japan's enemy. Hashimoto also urged Japan to form an anti-British alliance with other countries as soon as possible to avenge Britain's deep support for the Chongqing government. According to the Kokumin Shimbun, public opinion in Japan advocating the establishment of a military alliance with Germany and Italy is now becoming increasingly powerful.

<p>(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop formally signed the Italo-German political and military treaty in the "Ambassador's Hall" of the State Council at 11:08 this morning. The preamble of the treaty states: "The current borders of Italy and Germany have a fixed nature. The two nations must work together in the future to defend their vital space for survival and maintain peace." The text consists of seven articles:</p>
<p>Article 1: The signatory countries shall maintain regular contact on all matters of common concern to both parties and on the European situation.</p>
<p>Article 2: If the common interests of the signatory countries are threatened, they shall immediately exchange views. If the interests of one signatory country are threatened, the other signatory country shall provide assistance in political diplomacy.</p>
<p>Article 3: If one signatory country encounters war, the other signatory country shall provide full assistance in the sea, land, and air.</p>
<p>Article 4: The signatory countries shall cooperate closely on military and wartime economy, and shall establish two standing committees, each chaired by the foreign ministers of both parties.</p>
<p>Article 5: The signatory countries shall not separately sign peace agreements during wartime.</p>
<p>Article 6: The relationship between the signatory countries and other friendly countries shall be jointly established.</p>
<p>Article 7: This treaty shall take effect from the date of signing for a period of ten years. After the expiry of the term, the validity may be extended. (22nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The signing ceremony of the Italo-German political and military treaty was held in the "Ambassador's Hall" of the State Council. The hall was decorated with many fragrant flowers. Three chairs were placed next to the signing table. Four German civil servants stood in front of the table, each holding the treaty, two copies in Italian and two in German, for a total of four copies. At 11:00 AM sharp, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived at the same time. Leaders of the German military and party departments, senior officials, and diplomatic officials from Italy and Germany, totaling more than one hundred, followed them into the hall. In addition, there were many journalists. At 11:06 AM, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally went to the Head of State's office to welcome Head of State Hitler into the hall. The Head of State sat on the middle chair, with the foreign ministers of Italy and Germany sitting beside him. At 11:10 AM, the signing ceremony was completed. Head of State Hitler looked excited and shook hands happily with Ribbentrop and Ciano, and awarded Ciano the Golden Eagle Medal, the highest medal in Germany. At 11:12 AM, Foreign Minister Ciano took to the wireless radio microphone and gave a broadcast speech, stating that the political and military ties between Italy and Germany have been strengthened by the signing of the treaty. The fate of both sides is as closely related as lips and teeth. This is known to the people of both countries. "Both countries are willing to maintain peace, but are also determined to defend their inalienable right to survival." Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then gave a broadcast speech, stating that Germany and Italy have now become an indivisible group. If the democracies attempt to surround Germany and Italy with treaties that are temporarily suspicious and complex in content, and embark on the road to war, then the Italo-German alliance treaty is the firm answer to them. In the future, no matter what happens, our two countries will be united to deal with it. We are always willing to be friendly with all friendly countries, but we will also jointly defend our vital interests." Head of State Hitler had expressed earlier this month that he wished to conclude a broad political and military treaty with Italy to enhance mutual relations, and the treaty signed today is the natural result of this. (22nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the signing of the Italo-German political and military treaty, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano held a celebratory banquet at the Italian Embassy at 2:00 PM to entertain Head of State Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. At the end of the banquet, Foreign Minister Ciano, on behalf of his country, presented the "Annunziata Medal" to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. This medal is the highest honor in the country. Those who are honored with it are entitled to be called brothers of the King of Italy. Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to return to Rome at 11:20 AM tomorrow. (22nd Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) When the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with reporters this morning, the reporters asked one after another about the basic policy decided by the Cabinet on May 20. The spokesperson did not give a definite answer, only saying that Cabinet Secretary-General Ota had issued a statement stating that the opinions of the five ministers were harmonious and that the basic policy for the new European situation had been agreed upon. Beyond this statement, he could say nothing more. When a reporter asked if Japan had notified any foreign government of the policy it had decided on, the spokesperson was unwilling to answer, only saying that Japan was closely watching the European situation. Sensitive observers believe that Japan has refused to join the German-Italian military alliance, but Japan may have agreed to amend the Anti-Comintern Pact to express its sympathy for the German-Italian policy. (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Hochi Shimbun today urged Germany, Italy, and Japan to conclude a mutual assistance treaty, stating that the conclusion of a military alliance between Germany and Italy would greatly contribute to world peace. The five-minister meeting on Saturday and Sunday had agreed on Japan's basic policy towards the new European situation, but it was regrettable that there was no announcement regarding Japan's desire to strengthen the trilateral Anti-Comintern Pact. Germany, Italy, and Japan should urgently conclude a mutual assistance treaty. Only in this way can permanent peace in East Asia be ensured and another world war be prevented from happening. Some parties are deeply concerned that a trilateral mutual assistance treaty will give the democracies unnecessary stimulation. This is really an overestimation. Japan should strengthen and complete its cooperation with Germany and Italy in order to curb the conspiracy of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France to assist the Kuomintang government and attempt to obstruct the establishment of a new order in East Asia.

The British side then announced that the attitudes of both sides were extremely sincere, and it had been decided to request instructions from their respective governments. This showed that the British and French cabinet ministers had discussed in Paris yesterday and drafted a new proposal to form a compromise plan as the basis for negotiations. It is likely that the governments of Britain and the Soviet Union will not immediately send instructions to Geneva, and that the negotiations will continue in London after Lord Halifax has completed his affairs and the British Cabinet holds a cabinet meeting (this month on the 24th).

<p>Warsaw After Polish customs officials at the town of Karlow, Danzig Free City, fled to the town of West Simsdorf on the 20th of this month, it is now heard that the Danzig authorities have agreed to guarantee their safety. The Polish government has also ordered them to return to their customs posts and work with peace of mind. (22nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw The entire Polish nation has expressed outrage at two consecutive incidents of National Socialist Party members attacking Poles on the Polish-Prussian border within a few hours. After the Polish customs in Garschof was demolished by a group of Germans, uniformed stormtroopers soon rushed into the Polish tax post in Bicker. The inspectors there took refuge in the office and called for help. According to the latest Polish news, the tax post is still under siege. It is said that the stormtroopers who besieged the tax post had previously participated in a National Socialist Party gathering in Danzig. The Polish government has now ordered Polish representative in Danzig Chodacki to demand that the Danzig Senate immediately take all necessary steps to restore the freedom of the Polish tax officials in Bicker. At the same time, the authorities of Germany and Poland have protested against the unexpected incident in Garschof. Later, four Polish railway workers were arrested. Chodacki visited Danzig Senate Chairman Greiser last night to lodge a protest, and Greiser in turn presented Chodacki with a memorandum requesting compensation. It is said that when Polish Deputy Commissioner Perlowski arrived at the scene, the anti-Polish demonstration had ended. At that time, an innocent Danzig citizen named Gruber, who had just returned from Marienburg in East Prussia, was shot and killed just as he got off the car. All circles in Poland claim that the Garschof incident was undoubtedly a provocation, but it cannot be determined whether it originated from the Danzig Senate, the local National Socialist Party, or Germany. It is also said that the five National Socialist Party members who attacked Deputy Commissioner Perlowski's car came from Marienburg in East Prussia. (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw After the anti-Polish incident in the town of Karlow, Danzig Free City, relations between Germany and Poland have become tense again. The city council and the Polish authorities have recently protested to each other. The city council has asked the Polish government to apologize and hand over the car driver, Moloski, who fired the shots to the city authorities for punishment in accordance with the law. The Polish authorities, on the other hand, have asked the city council to thoroughly investigate the incident and compensate for all damages. Political figures here say that this provocative action by the National Socialist Party in Danzig is intended to force the Polish government to take direct action to protect the lives and property of Polish citizens, in which case Germany can immediately use this as an excuse to take action in Danzig. However, Poland has already seen through its concealment, and on the one hand avoids aggravating the situation, and on the other hand remains determined to maintain all its interests. It will closely monitor traffic at the border between Danzig and Germany to prevent German army troops from sneaking into the city. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German side is extremely angry after the disturbance in the town of Gallof, which borders the Free City of Danzig and the German province of East Prussia, yesterday. According to news received here, a German resident of the city, Gruber, was traveling to the station by car yesterday evening. The street was quiet and empty at the time. He then encountered a car belonging to a Polish diplomat. The driver of the car suddenly fired two shots, killing Gruber. The Chairman of the Danzig City Council, Greiser, has lodged a strong protest with the Polish government, demanding compensation for damages. At the same time, German citizens are extremely angry and have held demonstrations to protest. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw After the anti-Polish disturbance in the town of Karlow, Danzig City, similar incidents have occurred in other towns in the city, especially the town of Piccolo. Upon hearing this, people here are deeply concerned that Germany may take rights that Poland retains over Danzig tax customs (Poland has a tax alliance with Danzig city). Polish government-adjacent persons have all said that all the rights Poland retains must be maintained and that Danzig city’s jurisprudential status must never be subject to any unilateral changes. Although the National Socialist Party uses provocation as an excuse, Poland will never fall into its trap. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw Regarding the anti-Polish incident in the town of Karlow, Danzig City, Poland's senior commissioner in the city, Chodacki, recently protested to the chairman of the city council, Greiser, stating that the city government had recently provided guarantees that it would take necessary measures to ensure the safety of Polish customs officials so that they could perform their duties freely, but that this guarantee had not been fulfilled. "Thereby, the city authorities are unwilling to maintain order, or perhaps do not have the ability to do so, and should bear responsibility for this case. In short, the rights that Poland retains on the tax customs in Danzig will never be limited by faits accomplis. Hereby I request three items: (1) The city authorities should investigate the details of this case and notify Poland of the results of the investigation; (2) The damage suffered by the Polish customs should be compensated; (3) What guarantees can the city authorities provide to the Polish government to maintain order and protect the safety of Poles, given that Polish citizens and civil servants are often attacked. A clear and practical statement should be made immediately." (21st Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Chicago Former President Benes of Czechoslovakia has telegraphed the League of Nations Secretariat to protest against Germany's occupation of the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia, and Hungary's occupation of the province of Carpatho-Ukraine. He stated that "Our country is now under violent devastation and cannot send a delegation to the League of Nations to file a complaint. I have already telegraphed to Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to make representations on our behalf.

Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and Finnish Foreign Minister Holsti and Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler discussed the issue of fortifying the Aaland Islands. Regarding this matter, Sweden and Finland have agreed on a method and have concluded an agreement with the signatory countries of the 1921 international treaty (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Britain, France, Italy) to request approval from the League of Nations Administrative Council, but the Soviet Union has not yet approved.

<p>Ottawa. When the King of England inaugurated the National War Memorial here today, he delivered a speech that moved all who heard it. He said roughly: There can be no lasting peace without freedom, and no lasting freedom without peace. The archway, surpassed by the armed forces of the entire country, is topped with statues of Peace and Freedom. This is not a coincidence, for peace and freedom cannot be separated for long. Seeing this image in one of the world's capitals reminds people of the greatness of this truth. This memorial is sufficient to represent the spirit of Canada, and it is as if Canada is telling the world its heartfelt thoughts. Its symbolism is extremely appropriate, and its name, "Response," is also well-deserved, for at a glance, it reminds people of Canada's response when world peace was broken and freedom was threatened. Canada sacrificed 60,000 lives for this cause, and those who suffered physical and mental damage were even greater. This memorial is enough to show this to future generations and all nations, etc. The King's speech was clear and composed, and it was the most solemn of the speeches he has made on this trip. People gathered near the memorial at dawn. The King and Queen arrived at 11 o'clock, and before their arrival, cheers were heard from afar, one after another. The memorial was surrounded by guards in red uniforms, holding giant 14-foot-high flags as a guard of honor. When Canadian Prime Minister King respectfully invited the King to perform the ceremony, the guard of honor was divided into left and right columns. The crowd then removed their hats and sang the national anthem together. Then, the King and King together presented wreaths. The King and Queen stood with their subjects for half an hour today, without any sign of fatigue. They also walked around the memorial's pedestal and met with old soldiers and nurses. Then, amidst the crowd's cheers of "We want to see the King and Queen," they walked together to face the people gathered behind the guard line to receive their respects, and finally got into their cars and left. The memorial stands tall on one side of the square, and more than a dozen surrounding houses have been demolished. It faces Elgin Street, which has recently been widened from Parliament Hill South. With the green Laurentian Mountains as a backdrop, it is very magnificent. The monument is made of granite and cost 200,000 pounds. (Reuter's dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, according to well-informed foreign diplomats here, the government claims that President Roosevelt may go to London later this year to return the visit of the King and Queen of England. The White House's response to this report is inconsistent. State Department officials said they knew nothing about it. However, according to officials, it is customary for the head of a country to visit another country, and the head of that country must also return the visit. The King and Queen may personally invite Mr. and Mrs. Roosevelt to visit London. (Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) European situations are currently being commented on by observers here. The political and military alliance treaty between Germany and Italy is scheduled to be announced tomorrow. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will then conclude a defense agreement. The confrontation between the two major groups in Europe has thus been determined. As far as the German-Italian axis is concerned, Spain and Japan may not sign military alliance treaties with those countries. As far as the anti-aggression group is concerned, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Poland, and Romania are all included, and their strength is far greater. If Germany and Italy disrupt peace, it is tantamount to suicide. It is hoped that they will understand this and abandon their policy of force. Then, the United Kingdom can still cooperate with them. Foreign Secretary Halifax recently had a private conversation with German Ambassador Dirkson, and it is said that he told him the United Kingdom's position and made five statements: (1) The United Kingdom is determined to complete the security mechanism, and its intention is only to resist aggression and not to encircle Germany. (2) The United Kingdom will resist any attempt to change the European status quo by violence, but it is still willing to submit various current issues for discussion. (3) The agreement between the United Kingdom and Poland remains valid. Poland is resorting to war because of the issue of the city of Danzig, but its government has the right to decide. The United Kingdom still hopes that Germany and Poland will reach a friendly solution. (4) After Germany abolished the Anglo-German Naval Treaty of 1935, the United Kingdom is still willing to negotiate with Germany so that the method of mutually notifying shipbuilding procedures can continue to be implemented. (5) The United Kingdom is willing to conduct economic negotiations with Germany, that is, to allow a delegation from the British Industries Confederation to go to Dusseldorf, Germany on June 6 to hold a meeting with representatives of German industry. It is said that Ambassador Dirkson has conveyed the above views to the German government. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement Conference held its second annual meeting in Chongqing on the 21st. Hundreds of representatives from various branch associations, members, representatives of party and government organs, and guests from various groups attended. The situation was enthusiastic and tense. First, Shao Lizi, the chairman of the presidium of the conference, reported in great detail on the development of the international anti-aggression movement over the past year and the great contribution of our country's heroic resistance against Japan to the anti-aggression movement. Then, the training speech of Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, and the congratulatory telegram from Li Shizeng, the chairman of the standing delegation of the association stationed abroad, were read. (Chairman Chiang's training speech has been published in yesterday's newspaper.) After the reading, representatives from various organs delivered speeches one after another. Then, proposals and the conference declaration were discussed, and Ding Weifen, Yu Youren and others were elected as the 101 honorary chairmen of the second session, Song Qingling as the chairman of the honorary presidium, and Song Ziwen and Shao Lizi as the president and vice president of the second session. Finally, the conference passed a resolution to request the general association to step up its work in aiding China and curbing Japan, and to urge the League of Nations to implement sanctions against Japan.

<p>(Guilin) The Guilin Branch of the Anti-Aggression League sent a telegram to the China Branch in Chongqing on the 22nd, which was forwarded to the Geneva General Association, stating that Japan's invasion of our country will soon be two years. Recently, due to military failures, it has repeatedly bombed large urban areas in Chongqing, which is utterly inhumane. In order to strive for national independence and national freedom, we should resist to the end in order to win the final victory. However, world peace cannot be divided. If the Far East issue is not resolved in one day, then world peace will never be achieved. The Council of the League of Nations previously passed a resolution applying for individual assistance to China from various member states, but no effective results have been seen. For this reason, we intend to request that the current meeting of the International Council of Administration establish a necessary mechanism and take practical measures. In addition, the collective security system must include the Far East in order to effectively exert pressure on Japan and stop its aggression in order to seek peace in the Far East and seek world welfare.

<p>(Berlin) A major accident occurred yesterday at the Hijing Aircraft Factory in Nanquelsdorf Town, Berlin, which is the largest experimental aircraft field in Europe, causing the aircraft hangar to catch fire. The reason was that a flight trainee had just completed his solo flight and wanted to hand the plane over to another trainee, so the engine was not stopped. Unexpectedly, as soon as the trainee exited the plane, the plane took off by itself, flew over the airfield, hit the aircraft hangar, and exploded, causing all the newly built planes parked in the hangar to be destroyed by fire. The amount of loss is extremely alarming. (Haitong dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>—捷克滅亡以來— (European Correspondence)</p>
<p>From the perspective of the destiny of the entire human race, an unprecedented and very terrible situation is now right in front of us. What is involved is not only the interests of various countries, but the life and death of each other's systems; it is not only the issue of several countries and nations within a certain part of the earth, but the common issue of all mankind in the whole world. If this great war breaks out, then what will be used to fight each other is (to put it exaggeratedly) all the achievements created by mankind since the dawn of civilization; and what will be produced by this great war is (to put it profoundly) the entire future of human civilization. Now, China is bravely resisting and sacrificing heroically. The Czech Republic and Albania are gone. The United Kingdom still wants to make a final struggle for the survival of its aging empire. Japan, Germany, and Italy are still dreaming, wanting to use violence to drag the twentieth century back to the era of colonial expansion by imperialists before the nineteenth century. The only ones who are relatively happy are the United States and the Soviet Union, but on the other hand, the burden on these two countries is heavier than on any other country. In essence, however, the common problem of all countries is only one.</p>
<p>Is the above nonsense? In my opinion, absolutely not. My intention is to remind readers a little before describing the recent situation in Europe; that is, what is the real meaning of the current European crisis?</p>
<p>We, who have witnessed all the processes in the prelude to this major event, sometimes feel extremely nervous; and when we think of China's bright future, we feel unspeakable excitement. In the country, from the daily newspapers, through the world's telecommunications, everyone can see many developments regarding the European situation; however, there are omissions, and there are also rumors with ulterior motives. In Europe, needless to say, it is especially full of rumors, distortions, and propaganda everywhere. How can one correctly judge the situation? This is indeed not an easy task. However, our minimum guideline is: 1. We are Chinese people of the twentieth century, who account for one-fifth of the total human population. 2. Therefore, we firmly stand on the side of progress.</p>
<p>Now, I will describe the evolution of several major crises that Germany and Italy have created in Europe since the demise of the Czech Republic, and which are currently being forged.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic is Destroyed</p>
<p>It didn't take 24 hours for Hitler to swallow an independent country. However, this was not something that surprised the authorities of various European countries. Everyone knows that the several German armies that attacked the Czech Republic this time were already prepared long before September of last year. If there had been no "Munich Conference," according to what Hitler told the authorities of various countries—including the United Kingdom and France—he would have already planned to do so. In fact, the "Munich Conference" completely disarmed the Czech Republic, putting it in a predicament equal to having no national defense. Therefore, in the United Kingdom, there has been such a catchphrase since then: "The Czech Republic? Hmph, it is now a province of Germany!" Therefore, the focus of the problem lies in: After the United Kingdom and France had peacefully acquiesced to the Czech Republic being a German territory, why, at this time, did Hitler take this straightforward approach?</p>
<p>A direct answer to this question is easy to find: For the expansion of armaments by the United Kingdom and France, for the failure of Dr. Schacht's economic negotiations with the United Kingdom, and for the exhaustion of Germany's resources; therefore, Germany had to take coercive measures, seize the Czech Republic's military equipment and resources in one fell swoop, and incorporate them into the so-called "Four-Year Plan" of crazy preparations for war. According to general estimates, the ready-made weapons Germany obtained from this decision are equivalent to the total output of the United Kingdom's current military industry for eighteen months! As for other resources and means of production, they are so large that they cannot even be estimated.</p>
<p>However, compared to this question, there is an even more important question: What is Germany's direction after occupying the Czech Republic—eastward or westward?</p>
<p>At that time, two schools of thought arose in the United Kingdom and France. One school believed that this was a signal of Germany's eastward advance," and what they meant by "eastward advance" was seizing the Soviet Union's Ukraine. The other school of thought believed that Germany was actually seizing various resources in the east and stabilizing the rear, then turning around and concluding something similar to a non-aggression treaty with Poland, isolating Soviet Russia; then, joining forces with Italy to demand a redistribution of the world from the United Kingdom and France. Because of the difference in these two views, great controversy arose in the United Kingdom and France over the issue of Hitler issuing an "ultimatum" to Romania. Especially in the United Kingdom, the so-called "eastward advance" view, led by the current Finance Minister Simon, stubbornly argued that the United Kingdom should not interfere. In their view, it was necessary for Germany to attack the Soviet Union and invade Romania. Otherwise, they asked rhetorically, "How do you expect Hitler to attack the Soviet Union if he doesn't have a common border with the Soviet Union?" Therefore, they argued that the United Kingdom and France's defense line against Germany should be in Turkey: West of Turkey, Germany and Italy could act arbitrarily: If they entered the territory, the United Kingdom and France would begin to resist: Otherwise, Germany and Italy might seize India and Egypt! However, the so-called "westward advance" view, led by the current Foreign Secretary Halifax, felt that the former plan was very risky; because the main commodity for launching a war now is oil, and the United Kingdom's best trick for fighting against Germany is actually the blockade of food: If Germany and Italy obtain all the oil and food of the Balkan countries, then what means do the United Kingdom and France have to bring Germany and Italy to their death?</p>
<p>Needless to say, the latter view held an overwhelming advantage in the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union's attitude had just become particularly taciturn. In addition, people inside Germany represented by Goering who advocated a German-Soviet understanding were active, which further prompted the British authorities to be even more vigilant. On this point, they had to recall that Japan's proposal to Germany in February to launch an attack on the Soviet Union first was rejected. At that time, Japan felt that the war in China was hopeless and proposed to Germany to unite first and overthrow this "red country that is the root of world unrest!" But Germany's answer was: No!</p>
<p>All of this led the current British government to make the greatest determination. The first step in that determination was to guarantee the integrity of Poland's territorial sovereignty and sign a mutual assistance agreement. The second step was to guarantee the independence of Romania and Greece. In this way, the hope of further understanding between Germany and Poland was cut off; and if Germany turned around and attacked the United Kingdom and France, Poland would immediately have the obligation to respond to the United Kingdom's attack on Germany in the east; it would be childish to think that the Soviet Union could stand by and do nothing in a German-Polish war. Therefore, in this way, the British authorities calculated that they could actually pull the Soviet Union in. Therefore, the success of the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement was actually a great achievement of the current British government; compared to Poland, this agreement had even greater benefits for the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Germany, facing this situation, was absolutely unwilling not to respond. Thus—</p>
<p>(I) Albania is Destroyed</p>
<p>This small country with a population of only over 800,000 was actually already equal to Italy's dependency. The greatest purpose of this formal annexation was to strike first, taking advantage of the United Kingdom and France's unstable foothold in the Balkans. In this way, it surrounded Yugoslavia on one side and threatened Greece on the other. Mussolini executed this plan, but Hitler was its initiator. With Greece and Romania, they could have the entire Balkan Peninsula. At this time, a large number of British and French warships immediately concentrated near Greece. If Italy approached Greece, judging from the determination of the United Kingdom and France at that time, they would not hesitate to fight Germany and Italy in order to ensure traffic in the Mediterranean. Here, Germany and Italy were blocked head-on.</p>
<p>Thus, Hitler was again planning his other response; this is—</p>
<p>(III) The Free City of Danzig</p>
<p>Hitler's original preparation was to occupy the Free City of Danzig on April 29, as a gift for his fiftieth birthday!</p>
<p>The person who participated in the planning of this plan the most beforehand was the current German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. According to his and Hitler's plan, they intended to present several demands to Poland in the manner of an "ultimatum" (these items were later leaked, and the domestic newspapers have probably already published them.) As a condition of exchange, they were to conclude a so-called "Twenty-Five Year Non-Aggression Treaty"; they believed that Poland, which already had a mutual assistance agreement with the United Kingdom, would now definitely reject it. Once this was rejected, Germany could immediately occupy Danzig with justification. If Poland tried to interfere, then the British government would definitely automatically dissuade it. The "British expert" Ribbentrop was famous for believing that the United Kingdom would never be willing to fight for a city like Danzig; therefore, tracing back, he must have also dissuaded Poland.</p>
<p>Whether this estimate is correct (personally, I think it is quite accurate.) cannot be verified now because it has not been implemented. However, it is worth noting that its plan was shelved halfway. This reason came from Rome.</p>
<p>Hitler knew that he could absolutely not accomplish his occupation of Danzig by relying solely on words and verbal threats. As an accompanying step, he calculated on staging a large-scale show of force. On this point, he requested Italy's cooperation. However, to his surprise, Mussolini showed an unwillingness attitude. Italy's current focus is on some other places. (Any place, but especially not Danzig.) His hint was that if Hitler went to occupy Danzig, then Germany would have to deal with it alone.</p>
<p>In this way, the plan was temporarily shelved, and Hitler did not receive his ninetieth birthday gift on April 29.</p>
<p>Also at the same time as the above plan, but currently being intensified, as a response to the Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance negotiations, Hitler also has another plan;</p>
<p>(IV) The Near East and Africa</p>
<p>Everyone knows that General Brauchitsch, the most important figure in the German military, is currently in Rome; his final destination is Tripoli in Italian Africa. His greatest mission this time is to convey Hitler's advice to Mussolini to abandon his intention to attack Tunisia. As for Mussolini's ambition, it has been openly pursued for a long time, and there is no doubt about it. However, according to the opinion of the German military, the military preparations that France has made in Tunisia have actually reached their highest point. Attacking it would be very difficult. Therefore, it is very possible to fake the truth and cause a great war. In order to achieve greater results, simply threatening or planning would be much more certain for Egypt than for Tunisia. The quality and quantity of British military preparations in Egypt are generally far behind the French army in Tunisia.</p>
<p>To divert British attention from Central Europe, the most effective move is to threaten Egypt and then threaten the Suez Canal. This is the consistent view of Nazi strategists.</p>
<p>Now, judging from the information that is already known, the Italian army, which was probably already concentrated on the Tunisian border, has begun to move towards the Egyptian border. The British response is to quickly accelerate the resolution of the Palestine issue.</p>
<p>According to the views of the German and Italian military, if the United Kingdom is unwilling to show weakness and also resists in Egypt, then, before long, Germany and Italy can occupy the territory from Libya all the way to Abyssinia, and through the British-Egyptian Sudan, create a large encirclement of Egypt. When the issue will be revealed is still uncertain: however, its importance is no less than the current Central and Eastern European issues.</p>
<p>Among these endless conspiracies and territorial expansion plans of Germany and Italy against the United Kingdom and France, the most recent and most dangerous, and the most noteworthy place, is</p>
<p>(V) The Strait of Gibraltar</p>
<p>Spain has become a possession of Germany and Italy, and the Spanish coast has now been turned into a fortress of Germany and Italy. All of this was expected. But at the moment, Germany and Italy have not forgotten to use a puppet.</p>
<p>Now, Germany and Italy are using all their strength to exert great pressure on the Franco government, using him as a puppet to threaten the fatal point of the British sea lanes. This move, in German and Italian terms, is: "Recovering Gibraltar from British forces!" Their plan is for Franco to put forward this slogan on May 15. At the same time, Italy also declared that it absolutely "respects the integrity of Spain." "Integrity" of course includes Gibraltar, which was originally ceded to the United Kingdom by Spain. Franco's own attitude seems to be a little hesitant at the moment; however, under the strong control of Germany and Italy, in the end, there will probably only be one way to obey. (May 5)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Observations Along the Jingtai Route: The Depressed Market of Taixing and Damaged Bridges on the Highway <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Taixian Dispatch: The present "clean land" of northern Jiangsu, centered on Taixian County, makes the journey from Tai to Shanghai extremely difficult. One must take a small Taixing ferry to Taixing, walk to Xin'gang to catch a steamer. A traveler who arrived in Shanghai from Tai yesterday recounted his experiences along the way. The Taixing ferry was very crowded. After the boat set off, the village smoke and trees on both banks receded, evoking a sense of nostalgia for one's hometown. The boat traveled for five hours, arriving at Li Xiuhe, a town under the jurisdiction of Taixing County. Due to shallow water, it stopped there. It was only eighteen miles from the city, a distance easily covered by rickshaw. The road surface was mostly sandy, making for a light and brisk ride. In two hours, they reached the city. The market was depressed and the streets were surprisingly narrow. The ancient tower in the city center was relatively prosperous. The city was three miles long from north to south and five miles wide from east to west. The county government was located in the center of the city. The avenue in front of the government was still magnificent. Canals crisscrossed the city, with freely flowing water. Western-style wooden bridges were built above them. The willow-lined banks and the fragrant bird songs created a refined atmosphere. Taixing city was garrisoned by a standing × Brigade × Regiment. Political training posters were plastered all over the thoroughfares, encouraging the people. The next morning, they hired a small cart to leave the south gate and took the Yangjing Highway to Xin'gang. Along the way, the villages were planted with lush bamboo. Thousands of stalks stood tall, surrounded by sparse bamboo fences. The scene was like a painting. At eleven o'clock, they arrived at Bi Lu, eighteen miles from the city, the first line of defense for the Chinese forces. The market was in good condition, and the residents were calm. Beyond this, the journey became more difficult because the highway bridges had been destroyed by the Chinese army, requiring detours. Eighteen miles further was Zhangqiao Town, where a school was still holding classes as usual, with the sounds of music and singing audible from afar. At this front line of national defense, the continuation of education was truly commendable. Another eighteen miles ahead was Shengcitang, occupied by the Japanese army. The houses in the village were in ruins. The highway had been repaired by the Japanese army. Ten miles further was Baiyitang, where a rural elementary school had been destroyed. Recently, due to guerrilla attacks, the Japanese army had erected bamboo fences on both sides of the highway bridges, leaving only one gate for entry and exit, which was closed at night for defense. There was a puppet township government in the area, with absurd announcements plastered all over the walls, as well as Japanese announcements aimed at preventing highway sabotage. At four o'clock in the afternoon, they followed the highway through Jingjiang City. The Japanese army occupied the city. Along the way, the towns were covered with absurd notices from the puppet magistrate Yuan Luchen and the puppet police chief Tao Mingde. Jias Market had a puppet police sub-bureau, flying a five-colored puppet flag. Most of the bridges along the way had been repaired and named after Sada Yumi. Traveling along this road, the rivers and mountains remained the same, but the situation had completely changed, evoking a profound sense of loss. At five o'clock in the evening, they arrived at Xin'gang and stayed at a small inn. Puppet police came to inspect. The Japanese army had built more than fifty houses in the open space east of the port, housing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, forming a strategic stronghold with the Japanese army in Jingjiang. Merchant ships entering and exiting were forced to pay taxes. Red pills and white powder were readily available everywhere. Those addicted were everywhere, a sign of this toxic policy turning the world into a ghost town. In the morning, they left Xin'gang, hired a small rowboat, and boarded the Ruihe steamer. After setting sail, small Japanese patrol ships were seen busily moving back and forth in the Yangtze River. At four o'clock that day, they entered the Wusongkou. In the late evening, they landed at the Bund wharf on Beijing Road. After spending a few days in Shanghai taking care of private affairs, they returned to their hometown to continue their hard life.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Academia Sinica Plans to Establish an Institute of Applied Sciences, Cooperating with Industry and Commerce to Promote Economic Development <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Kunming Special Dispatch) Ren Hongjun, Director-General of Academia Sinica, told reporters yesterday that the six institutes of Academia Sinica—Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, History, Linguistics, and Social Sciences—had moved to Kunming. The two institutes of Geology and Psychology had moved to Guilin, and the two institutes of Biology and Meteorology had moved to Chongqing. They had all resumed work one after another. The focus of research was on assisting the war of resistance and solving practical problems. There were also plans to cooperate with industry and commerce to promote economic development and to establish an Institute of Applied Sciences to meet social needs in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e32">An Overview of Secondary Education in China (4): Strict Moral Education, Dedicated Counselors, and Long-Term Registration for War Zone Personnel and Students <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Methods of Moral Education</p>
<p>According to the regulations for secondary schools, moral education in secondary schools should be conducted in accordance with China's educational aims and implementation policies, cultivating the national morality of "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace" in young people, as well as developing a spirit of courage and perseverance and habits of discipline. Labor service is also required. The principals and all teachers of secondary schools should be responsible for moral education, lead by example, and adopt group training and individual guidance to educate students in all aspects of their activities inside and outside the classroom. Each secondary school should set up a director of moral education and a moral education committee to oversee moral education matters. However, the key points of moral education are nothing more than methods and personnel. The former should be perfected into a complete system, and the latter should be practically responsible. Therefore, in March of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline for Youth Training, dividing the basic concepts into four types: worldview, national view, state view, and world view. It also defined the goals and implementation points for each type of concept. The training items were divided into five categories: belief, morality, physical fitness, life, and service. The training for each category also had goals and implementation points. As for the training methods, they were divided into daily life and teaching courses. The former, in addition to the latter, which belongs to the curriculum, included small group gatherings, field trips, rural service, relief service, camping training, and inter-provincial travel, so that the outline would be clear and complete. In March of the same year, the Ministry also promulgated the Outline for the Counselor System in Schools Above Secondary Level, aiming to eliminate the increasingly distant and commercialized relationship between teachers and students. According to this system, each school divided the students in each grade into several groups, with each group limited to fifteen people. Each group was assigned a counselor, who was a full-time teacher, to closely observe and strictly guide the students' thoughts, behaviors, studies, and physical and mental health, taking into account their individual characteristics. The counselor should report the students' character, thoughts, and studies to their parents and hold a counselor meeting once a month to discuss progress. When students graduated, the counselor should issue a certificate to prove their character. In the same month, the Ministry of Education issued instructions on the points to be noted in implementing the counselor system, instructing all schools to carefully select counselors to ensure that they could practically bear the responsibility of counselors.</p>
<p>Teacher Certification and Professional Development</p>
<p>In May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the Ministry of Education promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Certification of Teachers in Secondary Schools and Normal Schools, which were divided into two types: examination certification and new examination certification. Teachers should participate in the appropriate type of certification based on their qualifications. At the same time, the organizational regulations for the review committee were promulgated to ensure that matters were handled carefully. Most provinces decided to implement this. There were regulations for the certification of civic education and moral education leaders, and all provinces followed them without exception. Starting in the 16th year (1927), normal colleges had already begun to hold certifications, and the Ministry ordered all provinces to continue to expedite the certification process. Four years later, new teachers hired by secondary schools who had not graduated from normal colleges or passed the certification were generally not allowed to be appointed.</p>
<p>Regarding teacher professional development, in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline of Measures for Research Associations for Secondary and Normal Education in Provinces and Cities, defining the scope of group research and the categories of research questions to be raised. In the 24th and 26th years, the Ministry issued examples of research questions to promote the regular professional development of teachers. Regarding the methods of lectures and discussions, the Ministry, starting in the 24th year, ordered the promulgation of measures for summer practice discussions for teachers of various subjects in secondary schools, and held four consecutive sessions. In the second session, designated universities and provincial education departments were responsible for the organization, with the responsibility leaning towards the universities. In the second session, the provincial education departments and universities were jointly responsible. After the third session, the responsibility leaned towards the provincial education departments. However, the fourth session in the 27th year was not held in most provinces due to the war. Only the four provinces of Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan held it. The work items of this training course included spiritual lectures, physical activities, academic lectures, discussions on educational issues, and subject-specific teaching methods. In past training courses, those who passed the examination were exempted from taking an examination in a certain subject when participating in the examination certification.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Educational Supervision of Secondary Education Nationwide <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Educational supervision is usually carried out annually by the Ministry of Education. During wartime, close supervision should be strengthened. In May of the 27th year (1938), the Ministry sent ten inspectors to inspect secondary education in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, starting from Wuhan. Based on their reports, the provinces were ordered to make improvements. In December of the same year, personnel were sent again to inspect secondary education in the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan for a longer period of time in order to understand the truth and find ways to improve it. At the National Education Conference in March of this year, it was also approved that each province should divide the entire province into several supervisory districts. In the future, the supervisory system will be implemented more actively.</p>
<p>Compilation of Textbooks</p>
<p>Textbooks for secondary schools have always been required to be reviewed before they can be adopted. After the war, the Ministry of Education realized that the content of various textbooks was either lacking in special teaching materials or did not meet the needs of the times. Therefore, forty reviewers and editors were recruited in Wuhan to conduct a general review of various textbooks on the market. Any teaching materials that needed to be added were added by the editors as supplementary teaching materials. In addition, the textbook system has always adopted a review system. Although it had been felt for several years that it was necessary for the Ministry to compile textbooks itself, and the compilation of textbooks for subjects such as civics, Chinese, history, and geography had begun, it had not yet been completed. Therefore, the Textbook Editorial Committee for Primary and Secondary Schools was reorganized, and experts were hired to actively carry out the compilation work.</p>
<p>Relief for Personnel and Students</p>
<p>In order to provide relief for secondary school personnel and students who had withdrawn from the war zone, the Ministry of Education established ten national secondary schools in various provinces starting in the 26th year (1937): "Henan Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Jiangsu; "Sichuan Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Jiangsu; "Guizhou Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui; "Shaanxi Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shandong; "Hubei Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Shandong; "Shanxi Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Shanxi; "Gansu First and Second Secondary Schools" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan; and Anhui First and Second Secondary Schools for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Anhui. Most of these secondary schools took in secondary school students, followed by normal school students, and some also took in vocational students. Most students were provided with food and lodging by the schools, as well as uniforms. The salaries of teachers and staff were not very different, averaging fifty yuan per month. After the war entered its second phase last autumn, Hubei Secondary School moved to northern Sichuan, and Henan Secondary School moved to southern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>The second method of providing relief for personnel and students was to establish service groups for primary and secondary school teachers in the war zone in various provinces. Eight service groups have been established in the seven provinces of Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Hubei, Gansu, and Hunan to take in teachers and staff and promote free education and mass education in the local area. At the same time, middle school classes, Zhongshan Middle School classes, middle school tutoring classes, and short-term vocational training classes were offered to take in students from various secondary schools.</p>
<p>The third method of providing relief for teachers and staff was for the education departments of various provinces to conduct long-term registration of teachers and staff in the war zone, report them to the Ministry for review, and then assign them to serve in the provinces after they had been reviewed and approved. Their living expenses were paid by the Ministry.</p>
<p>The third method of providing relief for students was for the Ministry to order the education departments of various provinces to conduct long-term registration, assign them to various public and private schools in the provinces nearby. The principle for the treatment of these students was that they should not pay tuition fees. As for food expenses, one-third could be completely waived, one-third could be waived by half, and the remaining one-third had to be paid.</p>
<p>Teacher Adjustment</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has ordered the education departments of various provinces to separately gather secondary school teachers in the schools who are unqualified or have poor performance and provide them with a longer period of professional development training, and then assign them to serve in the war zone teacher service groups or in various provinces. Their courses will still be taught by members of the service groups until the training period expires, the performance is evaluated as qualified, and the trained members return to their original positions. In this way, by drawing out teachers in batches, it will not be difficult to universally adjust the faculty of the entire province. In addition, Yunnan Province lacks teachers in science subjects. The Ministry of Education and the Yunnan Provincial Government have agreed to select more than forty teachers in subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, physical education, and scouting from the service groups in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces and send them to teach in various schools in Yunnan Province. Their salaries and travel expenses will be paid by the Ministry. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e36">The Davis Cup Doubles Match Experienced a Dispute and Appealed to the General Association; London Advised the Parties to Resolve it Amicably; Ultimately, Germany Won the Doubles Match <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Warsaw, 21st, Havas Telegram) In today's Davis Cup doubles match between Polish and German tennis players, the German team of Henkel and Metaxa defeated the Polish team of Heida and Bajorowski by a score of 5-7, 7-6, 6-4, 6-2, giving Germany a 2-1 lead overall. A dispute arose during the doubles match. The reason was that the last singles match the day before was not completed until yesterday. According to the original schedule, the doubles match should have followed immediately. However, because the German player Henkel had just finished the singles match and had to play in the doubles match, he was concerned that he would not have enough strength and requested that Menzel replace him. The Polish team agreed to do so. However, the German team then requested that the doubles match be postponed to today and that Henkel still play. The Polish team captain immediately protested and said that if the German team did not field Metaxa and Menzel, they should forfeit the match. The two sides argued and refused to yield to each other and appealed to the Davis Cup Committee in London. Although the committee believed that the Polish team was in the right, it advised both sides to resolve the matter amicably. In the end, the Polish team agreed to hold the doubles match today and allow Henkel to play.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Road YMCA believes that tap dance is a good indoor exercise. At the suggestion of the Sports Department, they have hired the famous tap dance expert Mr. Dick to teach the class. It is scheduled to start on the 13th of this month, with classes held on Tuesdays and Fridays from 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Members and non-members are welcome to join. According to Mr. Dick, tap dance has been included in the physical education curriculum of schools in Europe and America. This is because this type of dance not only has a pleasant rhythm, but also develops the muscles of the whole body, and does not require any special equipment or location for practice. It can be practiced anywhere, in the living room or bedroom. It is hoped that by hiring Mr. Dick to instruct the YMCA tap dance class, the Chinese people will have a better understanding of this fitness dance.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Frequent Victory Reports from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou; Chinese Army Begins General Offensive; Chinese Independent 5th Brigade Captures Liuhe Pagoda; Rumor that Chinese Army Has Breached Fuyang East Gate <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Tang Shengzhi Arrives in Zhejiang on Foot to Inspect the Eastern Battlefield</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Since the Chinese army on the Eastern Battlefield began its general offensive, victory reports have been frequent. The recent three-day battle situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Hangzhou's Suburbs Under Siege</p>
<p>Japanese defense positions at Zhakou, Hangzhou, were attacked by the Chinese Independent 5th Brigade on the evening of the 19th. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army immediately relied on fortifications and stubbornly resisted repeatedly. The two sides fought fiercely until the next morning, when the Chinese army, with air cover, managed to capture strongholds in the Liuhe Pagoda area and is now advancing towards Hangzhou City in victory. The Japanese stronghold in Sandun Town in the suburbs of Hangzhou was captured by the Chinese army on the 17th. The Japanese army in that area has been completely eliminated. The Chinese army in the suburbs of Yuhang approached the city directly on the 18th. It is said that the Japanese soldiers entrenched in the city number only one or two hundred, so they did not dare to resist stubbornly. In addition to tightly closing the city gates and defending, they telegraphed the Japanese special service agency in Hangzhou to find ways to reinforce them. However, roads and other transportation routes have been cut off by the Chinese army, so the Japanese reinforcements cannot rush to their aid. It is expected that the city can be captured soon. The Chinese army in Fuyang launched a three-pronged attack on the city on the morning of the 19th. It is rumored that the East Gate has been breached by the Chinese army, and fierce street fighting is now taking place. On the morning of the 22nd, the Chinese army near the Xiejiao Town area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line was preparing to attack the town when they encountered the Japanese army. The two sides then engaged in a fierce battle. As of the reporter's writing, no news of victory or defeat has been received. The Chinese army in the Sanbao area of Haining was attacked by the Japanese army on the 20th, resulting in the Japanese army being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese side.</p>
<p>Rail Tracks Near Xiashi Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Over the past three days, the Chinese army in the suburbs of Jiaxing has advanced towards the city along several routes. It is said that the eastern route has reached Jiaolijie, the southern route has reached near Wulong Bridge, and the western route has advanced from Xinsheng towards Sanliqiao. Yang'aidun (local name) has been officially recovered. In addition to capturing Santawan on the western route, they have now advanced to Xili Bridge. Therefore, gunshots and artillery fire are heard frequently in Jiaxing city, and the residents are panicked. The Chinese army in Huangwan and other places in Haiyan is now surrounding and severely attacking the Japanese army entrenched in the town, and they will soon be eliminated. Regarding the Chinese army in the Wangdian area, in addition to removing the rail screws a week ago, overturning four Japanese troop trains, and completely annihilating the Japanese soldiers, yesterday (the 20th), the Chinese army completely dismantled the rail tracks from Wangdian to near Xiashi, causing the first train from Hangzhou to Shanghai yesterday (the 20th) to be blocked in Xiashi until around 3 pm before repairs were completed. On the evening of the 17th, the Mao unit of the Chinese army vigorously attacked the No. 13 signal station along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese railway guards. However, as a result, all thirty-one Japanese soldiers were annihilated by the Chinese side. The Chinese 45th Brigade in Pinghu attacked the city the night before last, engaging in a fierce battle near the West Gate. As a result, the Japanese army could not withstand the attack and retreated into the city, so the situation in the city has become tense again. The Chinese army positions in Guangchen and Sanhe in the suburbs of Pinghu were attacked by the Japanese army from Zhujing, Pinghu, Jinshanwei, Jinsiniang Bridge, Jiashan, and other places on the 19th. The regular Chinese army in the area divided up to block the attacks, and the battle situation was fierce. The Chinese army positions in Zhongdai were also attacked by the Japanese army a few days ago and were immediately repelled. The Japanese soldiers attacking from the Jin Yaoting area have all been eliminated as of yesterday.</p>
<p>Chongde County Town Has Been Recovered</p>
<p>The Chinese army in the suburbs of Huzhou is also extremely active, so the Japanese soldiers in the city are extremely frightened. It is learned that the Chinese army in the Deqing area attacked the city the night before last, resulting in many enemy casualties. This morning (the 22nd), the Chinese army attacked the Japanese barracks guarding Shimenwan, but the result is unknown. Chongde County Town was captured by the Chinese army a few days ago. When the Chinese army rushed into the city, the puppet magistrate Wang and his staff fled in a chaotic situation. However, Wang's brother was unable to escape and was captured by the Chinese side and immediately executed. The Japanese army in Shanlian, Linghu, Lianshi, Wuzhen, and other places has been completely eliminated in a week. Tongxiang County Town was recently captured by the Chinese army, but temporarily evacuated due to strategic reasons, so the city is again occupied by the Japanese army, but they dare not go out, and the Chinese army is still surrounding the city with all its strength, hoping to annihilate the Japanese soldiers. All bridges on the Hangshan Highway, Jia Ping Road, and other places have been completely burned down in the past three days, so the Japanese troops' communication has been cut off. The Chinese army in Yuanzhen continues to attack the Japanese camp in Nanzha of the town for the past two days. Upon hearing the sound, the Japanese army did not dare to resist and fled to the people's homes to hide.</p>
<p>Tang Arrives in Zhejiang to Discuss Military Strategies</p>
<p>The Military Affairs Commission recently sent General Tang Shengzhi to inspect the Chinese positions in northern Jiangxi. After completing the inspection, he arrived on foot in Zhejiang ×× area a few days ago with his entourage. The Chairman of Zhejiang, Huang Shaohong, hosted a banquet to welcome him. It is said that Tang's arrival in Zhejiang was purely to inspect the situation on the Eastern Battlefield, so it is rumored that he will go to various places in western Zhejiang in the coming days. According to well-informed sources, Tang's arrival in Jiangxi and Zhejiang brought a new plan for a general counter-offensive. After the inspection, he will convene a meeting of military officers from various routes in ×× area.</p>

<p>Two Freight Trucks Were Burned by the Chinese Army</p>
<p>More Than Twenty Escorts and Passengers Are Missing</p>
<p>According to news from the transportation sector yesterday, at about 10 am on the 21st of this month, dozens of Chinese soldiers destroyed Bridge No. 62 on the Shanghai-Kunshan Highway. Just as they were completing their mission and about to retreat, two freight trucks traveling between Shanghai and Suzhou were heading to Shanghai from Suzhou and passed by the area. The Chinese soldiers suddenly ordered them to stop and burned the trucks and goods on the spot, and kidnapped the drivers, escorts, and passengers, totaling more than twenty people, and they have been missing ever since. After receiving the news, transportation companies in this city suspended all services yesterday, and traffic was completely blocked. It is now known that the companies have sent personnel to the scene of the incident to investigate the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The National Government Implements Strict Controls to Strengthen Foreign Exchange Protection; Strictly Prohibits the Import of Luxury Goods to Reduce Trade Deficit; Implements Resolutions of the Production Conference to Vigorously Seek Permits <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Inland Sales of Goods Requiring Foreign Exchange Settlement Require Permits</p>
<p>The National Government's international trade policy after the war is to restrict the import of luxury goods and encourage the export of domestic goods as much as possible. Since its implementation, it has achieved good results. It is now learned that the National Government authorities are implementing stricter controls on import trade. The National Government believes that during this period of resistance against Japan, trade deficits can weaken the country's strength. The import of luxury goods is still alarmingly high and should be corrected urgently. Therefore, it has ordered the customs to strictly prohibit the import of such goods. At the same time, when merchants purchase foreign goods and apply for foreign exchange, they must choose essential goods before approval. This plan is in accordance with the government's policy of protecting foreign exchange stability. At the same time, the government is now working hard to increase the export of Chinese products such as tung oil, silk, and tea to earn foreign exchange, and to implement the resolutions of the National Production Conference, vigorously seeking self-sufficiency to reduce the need for imports.</p>
<p>Inland Sales of Goods Require Permits</p>
<p>According to the original regulations, goods designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs that require foreign exchange settlement, such as those transported for sale inland, should be handled by the local trade commission branch, which issues a Category B transportation permit before shipment and customs clearance. It is now learned that the Trade Commission has telegraphed to suspend the issuance of this Category B transportation permit. From now on, goods that require foreign exchange settlement and are transported for sale inland should be handled in accordance with the revised regulations for restricting the reporting and transshipment of export goods. The New Voice News Agency reporter has compiled the following regulations:</p>
<p>Regulations for Restricting the Reporting and Transshipment of Export Goods</p>
<p>(1) All export goods, except those exempt from foreign exchange settlement, may not be reported and transshipped from the inland to areas close to the war zone and coastal and border provinces without a "Domestic Sales Permit" issued by the Ministry of Finance. (2) When reporting export goods, the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate" or "Transportation Permit" (Category A transportation permit) should be verified and released at the customs post at the place of departure or the first customs post passed during transportation. Those without the above-mentioned documents and are not exempt from foreign exchange settlement should all be subject to foreign exchange settlement. (3) For export goods that have a portion sold in non-war zone provinces other than the place of origin, the provincial construction department should estimate the actual quantity needed and send a letter to the Trade Commission for verification and transfer to the Ministry of Finance for approval to issue a "Domestic Sales Permit" before reporting and transshipping. The Ministry of Finance's interpretation of Article 3 of the above regulations is as follows: To apply for a domestic sales permit for goods requiring foreign exchange settlement, the provincial construction department of the province of sale should first estimate the quantity of the above-mentioned goods actually needed in the province within a certain period and send it to the Ministry for approval, and then merchants should apply to the department, which will verify and send it to the Trade Commission for verification and transfer to the Ministry for processing.</p>

<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the English-language Da Mei Evening News, the Chinese-language Da Mei Morning News, and the Da Mei Bao were banned from sale for publishing a Chongqing telegram of President Chiang's instructions to the Production Conference. They have telegraphed U.S. Secretary of State Hull, stating: "The Chinese-language Morning News of this company has been ordered to stop publication by the authorities in the Shanghai Concession for reprinting the speech on economic issues by President Chiang, the leader of the Chinese government recognized by all countries.

<h3 id="e52">Strike at British Lanchang Factory; British Troops Land to Protect; Started Due to the Dismissal of One Worker; The Factory Had No Choice But to Suspend Work Temporarily <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The China Press reported that the Chinese workers at the British-owned Lanchang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, went on strike on Saturday and Sunday and could not be controlled at all, and beat a British supervisor. A team of British sailors from the British warship HMS Taku landed at the factory to control the bad situation and prevent the striking workers. After the British sailors landed, the Chinese workers dispersed and returned home. Yesterday (the 21st), it was learned that Lanchang Textile Factory, owned by British Lanchang Dyeing and Printing Co., Ltd., employed</p>
<p>Many Chinese Workers</p>
<p>They decided to strike at nearly 9:30 am on Saturday because a Chinese worker in the motor room was dismissed, took a threatening attitude, and refused to leave the factory, and the situation became bad. In the afternoon, a British supervisor was beaten by workers, injured, and hospitalized. The factory had no way to fully control the strikers, and decided to request protection. A</p>
<p>Team of Sailors</p>
<p>From HMS Taku, accompanied by Thomas from the Japanese Affairs Section of the British Consulate, sailed down and landed at the factory by the waterfront, changing the dangerous situation. An official from the British Consulate told reporters yesterday that, in view of the direct danger to British lives and property, a team of sailors from HMS Taku was sent to land at the textile factory on Saturday night. This move had the effect of restoring order, and the workers soon</p>
<p>Left Quietly</p>
<p>It is heard that the dismissed employee who caused the strike had been warned several times before for neglecting his work and not following instructions. Because it was discovered that he was inciting Chinese workers to strike, he was dismissed. Consultations between the factory owner and the strikers have not yet resolved this dispute. The factory buildings have been sealed off pending the final outcome. It is heard that the factory will no longer employ the dismissed employee because of his poor performance. The British factory owner issued</p>
<p>A Formal Announcement</p>
<p>Stating that at 9:30 am on Saturday, a strike occurred at the Lanchang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, due to the dismissal of a worker in the motor room. The worker had been warned three times before for neglecting his work and not following instructions. A month ago, he was given a final warning. On Friday, it was discovered that he was inciting workers to strike, so he was dismissed on Saturday. As a result, the workers in the machine room and the power room stopped working. Because the power supply was cut off, all machines</p>
<p>All Stopped</p>
<p>Negotiations have not been successful so far. The factory cannot re-employ the dismissed employee because of his poor performance and has been tolerant. The factory has been forced to seal off pending a more reasonable attitude from the workers. The English-language Da Mei Evening News also reported that the Japanese-run Chinese-language newspaper "Xin Shen Bao" published in Hongkou today (the 22nd) called the strike at the British Lanchang Textile Factory "a manifestation of the rising</p>
<p>Anti-British Sentiment of the Chinese"</p>
<p>And predicted that labor disputes would spread to other British factories in Shanghai. According to the Japanese view, the 2,000 workers in the Lanchang Textile Factory declared a strike to sympathize with worker Gu Jingen, who was "dismissed for complaining to the manager about the abuse of female workers by a Russian clerk." It also claimed that a female worker was walking slowly when leaving the factory and was kicked by the Russian clerk, and Gu was also beaten by the Russian when he tried to stop him. According to unconfirmed</p>
<p>Chinese Sources</p>
<p>The strike at the Lanchang Factory or the start of strikes by workers at other British factories is a sign that the strike was incited by the "Reformed Government" and "Da Min Hui" under Japanese auspices. Earlier Chinese sources claimed that two organizations under the Japanese</p>
<p>Have Been Engaged in Inciting Workers to Strike</p>
<p>And have promised to subsidize Gu's family with 30 yuan per month during the strike and each worker with 15 yuan.</p>

<p>The China Press reported that 110 Chinese households in two lanes facing Yu Yuan Road and actually in the "Road" area were surprised on Saturday afternoon when Japanese military police posted notices in the two lanes prohibiting anyone from moving in or out. The two lanes are Zhongshi New Village and the opposite Siming Villa. As far as can be ascertained, Siming Villa is</p>
<p>Owned by Siming Bank</p>
<p>Zhongshi New Village is the property of the China Industrial Bank. Japanese military police reappeared in the two places yesterday morning, presumably to find out if anyone had violated the orders of the previous day. Several Chinese police officers are on duty as usual on Yu Yuan Road outside the two lanes. The purpose of the notices could not be learned from officials. One theory is that the Japanese authorities consider the property to be owned by Chinese banks such as the China Industrial Bank and intend to</p>
<p>Levy Rent</p>
<p>Or confiscate it altogether. Another theory is that the residents of these houses enjoy the public benefits of the Public Concession, and although they have already paid municipal taxes, the "Road" authorities also intend to levy taxes on them. Some evidence of this theory was obtained last night. Reporters asked various officials</p>
<p>About This Situation</p>
<p>None of them could explain it. However, the residents of the buildings in the two places do not seem to be particularly troubled by the notices, because one of the residents told reporters that they could not find a place to live elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Rice Supply Increases and Sources Are Plentiful; Food Supply is Temporarily Not a Concern; Market Chaos Has Subsided Slightly; Rice Merchants Order 2,000 Tons of Foreign Rice; Total Rice in the City is 557,840 Bags <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The soybean and rice market has calmed down slightly as the sources of supply from various places have gradually increased. Although the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee has dissolved itself, the set price limit remains in effect. The eighth survey of rice stocks was released yesterday, showing an increase of 4,592 bags from the previous period, for a total of 557,840 bags of rice in the city. Rice merchants have ordered 2,000 tons of foreign rice. The entire food supply of Shanghai City is not expected to be in short supply. Details are recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>Many Call on the Authorities to Control the Market</p>
<p>Since the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee was forced to dissolve itself due to the difficulty of carrying out various tasks, market transactions have been quite chaotic, and rice prices have soared, which has rarely been seen before. In view of this bad phenomenon, various public organizations in this city believe that if a proper solution is not planned early, it will not only increase the burden on citizens, but also affect the food supply of more than 4 million people, which is of great importance to the future. Moreover, in Shanghai after the war, the vitality of various industries has not recovered, and the lives of ordinary people are difficult, but some hoarders disregard the fattening of themselves at the expense of others, and only seek personal gain, manipulating the market and raising prices, which is really unconscionable. Therefore, we urge the authorities of the concession to quickly take strict measures to stop and punish them severely, and to quickly find effective ways to control the market, so that speculators cannot get involved and cannot use their skills.</p>
<p>Rice Stocks Increased by Four Thousand Last Week</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association yesterday that the eighth survey of rice stocks in the city was completed yesterday. The total rice in the city is 551,784 bags, an increase of 4,592 bags from last week. Therefore, the food supply of Shanghai citizens can definitely be assured, and rice-producing areas such as Wuhu, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Changshu are shipping to Shanghai in a steady stream. Yesterday, 45 ships from various routes along the river delivered more than 5,000 bags. The survey of rice stocks will continue to be conducted by the Soybean and Rice Industry Association and will still be conducted once a week.</p>
<p>Accurate Number of Rice Stocks in Eight Surveys</p>
<p>The accurate number of rice stocks in each rice warehouse is as follows: Bank of China 104,708 bags, Bank of Communications 5,429 bags, Zhejiang Industrial Bank East and West Warehouses 92,338 bags, Shanghai First 9,048 bags, Shanghai Second Xiechangde 2,233 bags, Industrial Bank 45,624 bags, Kenye Bank 246 bags, Zhongyi Trust 100 bags, Local Bank 12,468 bags, Jincheng Bank 5,988 bags, Xinhua Bank 25,899 bags, Jiangsu Second 2,790 bags, Donglai Bank 4,370 bags, Zikang 7,163 bags, Hengfeng 1,160 bags, Longmao 23,876 bags, Yuan Yu 125 bags, Yuanxiang 757 bags, Shengfei 1,130 bags, Yongsheng 170 bags, Taikang 345 bags, Dada 2,179 bags, Zhengfeng North and South 1,788 bags, Ruifeng 736 bags, Dafengchang 600 bags, Zhengda 4,229 bags, Dayouyu 4,770 bags, Dade Xinbei 1,434 bags, Gongji 1,017 bags, Hengyigong 40 bags, Runji 1,153 bags, Xinchang 6,670 bags, Dehexing 1,834 bags, Xinyu 6,425 bags, Dade Xinzhong 4,200 bags, Shenghelong 2,751 bags, Chengyi 360 bags, Shengmao 23 bags, Hengda 4,760 bags, Dade Xinnan 3,354 bags, Jutaihe 106 bags, Hengxingyi 89 bags, Jiangnan 2,976 bags, Yixingfeng 3,553 bags, Jiuda 459 bags, Wanchang 1,725 bags, Xinye 1,634 bags, Heji South 334 bags, Yucheng 355 bags, Hengtai 869 bags, Qiada 900 bags, Zhang Xiejun 786 bags, Wansensheng 146 bags, Yusheng 1,015 bags, Wanshengtai 153 bags, Yixin 1,435 bags, Faji 816 bags, Wanshengxing 245 bags, Maotai 30,703 bags, Xiechangde 1,315 bags, Qingshengyi 1,161 bags, Tongshen 3,358 bags, Roosevelt 3,500 bags, Taikoo 3,213 bags, Changyiheng 1,196 bags, Dingtaide 14,807 bags, Anshen Second 1,738 bags, Anshen Third 8,007 bags, Xinfeng 899 bags, Hufeng.

<p>Ordered Foreign Rice Approximately Two Thousand Tons</p>
<p>Because of recent manipulation by hoarders, there are few spot cargoes on the market, and the price of domestic rice has soared. The 15-yuan price limit is only a name. Moreover, the current price of domestic rice is equal to the price of foreign rice. Each rice merchant has ordered a large amount of foreign rice from foreign rice-producing areas such as Annam, India, and Saigon, totaling as many as 2,000 tons, and entrusted Dafu Foreign Firm to handle it. They will be shipped to Shanghai soon to provide relief. Moreover, at the turn of spring and early summer, the weather is gradually getting hotter, and all kinds of rice and grain are difficult to store for a long time, so people's hearts are small.</p>
<p>Market Chaos Slightly Subsided</p>
<p>In the soybean and rice market, the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee dissolved itself. All 105 rice industry firms believed that the price limit of 15 yuan for top-quality white rice had also been cancelled, so they set prices privately and traded with each other. Spot cargoes in the market can meet supply and demand, but the price is higher. Changshu extra-white rice has risen to 245 yuan. The momentum of rising prices for the local rices is also very strong. In the market yesterday morning, as sources from various places gradually increased and the Market Management Committee made every effort to explain that the price limit was still in effect and had not been cancelled, the market situation was calmer and the market price also fell by 35 yuan. A total of 3,500 bags were traded.</p>

<p>Since suffering eight major bombings by Japanese planes, Ningbo has recently shown some signs of tranquility, and the situation has tended to ease. All sectors in Ningbo are now handling the aftermath and have established the Ningbo Disaster Relief Committee for Compatriots. A total of 15,000 yuan has been raised to heal the wounded and console the dead, and progress is quite active. According to inquiries from a German shipping company's shipping radio station, there was another air raid alarm in Ningbo at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, which was not lifted until the afternoon. The Japanese planes did not drop bombs. As for the public sentiment, as of 7:00 PM, no telegrams had been received from Ningbo, so there was no way to know.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Increase Sailings, Operating to Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Ningbo route was approved for resumption by the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters, the Moufu Wheel of the German company Lihe Yanghang was the first to resume sailing on the morning of the 20th, and safely entered the port that evening. Now that the ship has finished unloading cargo, it is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo on the 24th. It is learned that the Italian shipping company, Zhongyi Shipping Company, has decided to send ships to increase sailings on the Shanghai-Ningbo line in order to alleviate cargo transportation. In addition to the Kangsha Wheel, which set sail for Ningbo yesterday afternoon, the company's Deping Wheel also returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday afternoon and is scheduled to sail to Ningbo today. However, if the time is not sufficient, it may be postponed to set sail tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hana Sails to Wenzhou, Shanghai-Ding Line Suspended</p>
<p>After the resumption of the Shanghai-Ding route, the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters designated one Hana Wheel to operate exclusively to maintain transportation. According to news from the Far Eastern Shipping Company, the Hana Wheel left Ding at 8:00 PM yesterday afternoon and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. However, due to the sluggish cargo transportation on the Shanghai-Ding line, it has been decided to change to the Wenzhou route after arriving in Shanghai, and the Shanghai-Ding line will be temporarily suspended. As for the Gaodeng Wheel of the German company Lulin Yanghang, it has already sailed from Ding to Ningbo and the voyage is quite smooth. In the future, it will regularly operate on the Shanghai-Ding line.</p>
<p>Relief Donations Exceed 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Ningbo Association in Shanghai entrusted various banks to collect disaster relief donations, compatriots in Shanghai, in view of the tragic disaster in their homeland, have donated enthusiastically. The situation is very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, the total amount has exceeded 20,000 yuan, and it is not difficult to reach the target of 50,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Japanese Yen Continues to Fall in Price, 92.3 Yuan in Legal Tender Can Buy 100 Yen in Japanese Gold, Reserve of "Huaxing" Banknotes Suspect <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that on today (the 22nd) the exchange market in Shanghai continued to see the Japanese yen depreciate against the legal tender. Exchange shops on Sichuan Road were buying Japanese yen at a rate of 92.3 yuan in legal tender for 100 yen in Japanese gold, and selling Japanese yen at a rate of 92.7 yuan. It is widely believed that this is the lowest price of the Japanese yen in many years. The official rate in Tokyo is 150 yuan in legal tender for 100 yen in Japanese gold. It is noted that the trend of the Japanese yen's depreciation began at the beginning of last week, when Shanghai shops began to exchange legal tender</p>
<p>at par</p>
<p>with Japanese yen, but since Friday of last week, the Japanese yen has fallen lower than the legal tender in the local market. Today's exchange rate continued to fall compared to last Saturday and Sunday. It is noted that on Saturday and Sunday of last week, exchange shops bought Japanese bank notes for 94.8 yuan in legal tender per 100 yen in Japanese gold, and sold Japanese yen for 95.3 yuan in legal tender. It is pointed out that these exchange rates only apply to Japanese bank notes. The price of Korean bank notes is at least 15 to 20 percent lower. At the same time, money changers in the occupied areas under the jurisdiction of the "Reformed Government" have decided to handle the banknotes of the Huaxing Commercial Bank, which only started</p>
<p>limited circulation</p>
<p>a few days ago, at the "black market exchange rate". 100 yuan in legal tender in Chinese currency requires 160 "Hongkou currency." In other words, the actual price of one yuan of "Hongkou currency" is only slightly more than 0.6 yuan in legal tender. It is heard that the Huaxing Bank intends to circulate 20 million yuan worth of banknotes. According to the current exchange rate, the surface value of 20 million yuan in banknotes is only worth 13.5 million yuan, but this number is still huge, and the bank issuing this banknote, its reserve</p>
<p>is highly suspect</p>
<p>The value of Japanese military scrip in the interior is also unstable, depending on the circumstances of its use. If a team of Japanese people tries to pay for goods with military scrip, they are likely to be accepted at face value. However, if Japanese soldiers or Japanese people use it alone, they may have to offer a discount, and when used by Chinese people, the discount is even greater. It is heard that in villages and towns where the Japanese military presence is less prominent, those who try to force the circulation of military scrip are signing their death warrants.</p>

At present, there are more than 70 large and small silver shops in Shanghai, which not only occupy a considerable force in the local financial community, but have also become a necessary mechanism for regulating funds for small and medium-sized industries and commerce. It is learned that the leaders of the industry, Huang Yuqi, Zhang Renwei, and others, in view of the fact that there is little communication among their colleagues on weekdays, and each is right in their own way, the methods are inevitably different, and the effectiveness has not been fully发挥, have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Silver Shop Industry Association. Yesterday (the 21st) at 7:00 PM, the first inaugural meeting was held at the Huizhong Lianhuan Society on Shilu Road. More than 20 representatives of the main bodies of various silver shops, including Yan Dexiu, Hu Qingchen, Zhang Tongsheng, Ji Xiangqing, Yao Ruilian, Zhou Huili, Fan Shaoliang, and Wang Xifu, attended the meeting. Huang Yuqi was elected chairman, and he immediately reported that the population of this city has increased sharply due to the war. On the one hand, small and medium-sized industries and commerce have shown lopsided and abnormal development. On the other hand, domestic hot money lacks proper channels for utilization. Thanks to the efforts of our silver shop colleagues, we have worked separately to make up for the deficiencies and regulate industry and commerce. In recent years, the rapid development of our industry has met the urgent needs of society. However, in wartime economy, everything depends on cooperation, and our own strength lies in unity. Banks and money shops are guaranteed by industry associations, and their status is becoming more and more stable, and their effectiveness is fully发挥. Only our industry is lacking in this regard. In terms of the industry's prosperity and innovation, the steps are inevitably uneven. In order to promote sincere cooperation and expand the effectiveness of our industry, the organization of an association is a matter of urgency, and so on. Then the discussion began, and the motion to initiate the organization of an industry association was unanimously passed, and Cao Zhigong was hired as Secretary-General, and preparations were actively made from now on. During the meeting, the representatives expressed their opinions and many valuable insights on the current financial situation in this city. After the meeting, Mr. Huang hosted a banquet to promote friendship. It was not until about 10:00 PM that the guests and hosts dispersed happily.</p>

<p>British Merchants Decide to Maintain Routes with All Their Strength</p>
<p>Japanese shipping companies such as the Japanese Qing Company, Dalian Company, Osaka Company, and Japanese Post Company, with the assistance of the Japanese government, are making every effort to expand their shipping business in China, attempting to monopolize everything. The Japanese Navy in China provides convenience for the entry and exit of Japanese ships, so that the Yangtze River middle and lower reaches and North China routes, the ships of third countries have been squeezed and the impact is extremely weakened, while Japanese ships have become more active. In addition, it also prevents ships of third countries from entering inland ports. Some of the third-country ships seized after the war have been released after negotiations with the Japanese by the consuls of the respective countries, while more than 20 ships have not been released, such as the Tangbei Meida Libao and other ships. According to news from the New Sound Agency, some of them have been confiscated, renamed, and transferred to the Japanese Qing Company for use. Therefore, shipowners from various countries have been given close attention by their governments. As for British shipping companies, in order to maintain their original routes in China, they have decided to deal with it with all their strength, and have obtained mutual contact with the British Navy's Far East Fleet to implement self-defense and prevent interference from third parties.</p>

<p>The French Veterans Friendship Association in China of the European War, in order to help the French people who were seriously injured in the war, held a charity fair on the 5th of this month at No. 11 Huanlong Road, the French Veterans Friendship General Association. All the faculty, staff, primary and secondary school students, and more than a thousand refugees of the First Reception Center of the International Relief Association on Masnan Road, out of admiration for the great spirit of all the veterans of the Veterans Association who defended their country, fought against the enemy, and sacrificed bravely, entrusted Mrs. Yudan to donate 20 handmade handbags to the association, expressing their respect. All the French侨of the association were very moved. A few days ago, the chairman of the association, Luo Qiai, in the name of the chairman of the association, on behalf of all the French侨of the association, sent a letter to Pan Da, director of the First Reception Center of the International Relief Association on Masnan Road, asking him to convey his deep gratitude to all the refugees, staff, and primary and secondary school students of the center. The letter stated that the Veterans Association held a charity fair to help the French people who were seriously injured in the Great War of 1914-1918. The refugees and staff of your center have given many gifts, which is deeply appreciated. The voluntary act of the refugees and staff of your center shows the great spirit of benevolence, bravery, and sacrifice of the Chinese people, and proves that the friendship and cooperation between China and France is even more enhanced.</p>

<p>— Mr. Yuan Ludeng—(Continued)</p>
<p>To commemorate this scholarship, he changed his original name "Xian'an" to "Lidun" to show that he would never forget it. During his hard study period, he also suffered the death of his maternal grandmother. His family was also destitute, and he relied on him to run around for three days before he was buried. At the age of nineteen, he was recommended by Feidi Middle School to Shanghai St. John's University, and he was given a full scholarship to dispose of. At the age of twenty-three, he was promoted to the main hall (at that time, St. John's was still called a college), and he was promoted by the Dean to assist the chemistry room with a monthly salary of 15 yuan. At the age of twenty-six, he graduated and returned to Ningbo to serve as the vice principal of Feidi Middle School. He continued to teach in various schools for more than ten years. As we chatted to this point, the reporter was very sympathetic to Mr. Yuan's spirit of hard study, but when I thought about how many ambitious young people have encountered difficulties and cannot continue to go to school since the national crisis, how sad should we be? How heartbroken should we be? It is said that Shanghai can still have books to read, but it is a rare thing to run a good school at the same time without excluding ambitious young people from school due to family economic relations, or even a fantasy. Looking at the past from today, we can't help but sigh. At that time, I showed Mr. Yuan a desire that he would help the powerless students in the current suffering. This silent request, Mr. Yuan also sadly said that he hoped everyone would work together to find a practical way.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan continued to say in a sad tone about his experience in serving the society. After the restoration of the Republic of China, he served as the Director of Foreign Affairs and Transportation of the Ningbo Military Government. In the second year of the Republic of China, he came to Shanghai and was hired by Cen Yunjie of Xilin to go to Hanzhong to serve as a translator for the Supervisory Office of the Hanyue Sichuan Railway. Later, he returned to Shanghai and served as the assistant to the manager's office of the Commercial Press. He also assisted Xie Hengchuang in running the Dulou Coal Mine and the Shunchang Shipping Company. At the same time, he devoted himself to various charitable organizations and later served as the general manager of the Duoshao Shipping Company. At the successive meetings of Chinese taxpayers, he was elected as a Chinese director of the工部局. Finally, he said, "Because I was born in poverty, I have tasted all kinds of hardships, so I treat people and things with loyalty and forgiveness as the foundation. Over the years, I have spared no effort to find jobs for people and provide guarantees for people, and there has been no year without suffering for others. The total amount of compensation is no less than 100,000 yuan." He believes that only mutual assistance can maintain social cohesion, so he said that even if he loses money, he will not complain.</p>
<p>We have talked for so long, and I think there are many parts of it that are worth reading for young people. Mr. Yuan also said that the Shenbao's contribution to the society is even greater at this time, so I also briefly recorded what he said for the readers. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e65">Monk Yingzhao, Adultery with a Young Woman, Sun Yaohuan Leaves Home to Join the Army, The Lecherous Monk Actually Seduces His Wife, The Case is Adjudged to One Year in Prison <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Baoben Hall on Mount Putuo in the South China Sea is one of the largest monasteries in the major mountains in the north and south. The current host, Monk Yingzhao, has a wide range of contacts, and his reputation is growing day by day, seemingly becoming the祭酒among monks. In fact, he is also a member of the wine, meat, and sensuality, the 流亚of Haige Li. Now his hypocritical mask of stealing fame and deceiving the world has been揭穿, and he has been sentenced to imprisonment for adultery with a married woman. Because Yingzhao is the host of Baoben Hall in Putuo, he also serves as the host of the Baoben Hall branch in Changsha Road, Public Concession of this city. The association comes to Shanghai from Ningbo every time, then Zhuoxi is here.</p>
<p>Years ago, in Shanghai</p>
<p>there was a wealthy merchant from Fuliang, Mr. Sun, who, because of his admiration for Buddhism, had外交with Ding Fang. In 1935, Sun's commercial operations in Suzhou and Shanghai successively failed, and he returned to Jingde in Ganzhou with鍛羽. However, the old residence was萧然and it was difficult to live, so he brought his son Sun Yaohuan and his daughter-in-law Jiang Meili to Putuo. At that time, Yingzhao saw that an old friend had投, and inquired about the situation, and readily留them. He then took the remaining house on the side of the temple, gave them a eave, so that Sun and his son and daughter-in-law could reunite. The initial intention was not evil. Until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Sun Yaohuan deeply knew that this was a war of national liberation, it was time for young people</p>
<p>to Dedicate Themselves to Serving the Country</p>
<p>He resolutely said goodbye to his new bride Jiang Meili, and entrusted his old father and娇妻to Yingzhao. Until January of this year, when he took a leave from the army and returned to the mountain to visit his relatives, there was only white hair in the hall, and no 红颜resident. When he asked his father, he learned that Jiang had been略诱离山by Yingzhao last winter and遁迹at sea. After hearing this, Yaohuan thought that the monk was his father's Zhizhi, and he had such a beastly act, not only蔑弃Xinyi, but also was a Buddhist scum. So he followed to the孤岛, and repeatedly went to the Baoben Hall Temple on Changsha Road to参谒, but he could not see him. After侦之无踪, it was not until noon the day before yesterday that he</p>
<p>Found Out That the Monk</p>
<p>His wife was hiding on the top floor of No. 48 Wenzhou Road. He immediately reported to the Chengdu Road police station, which ordered Chinese and Western detectives to go to the address for investigation, and the lecherous monk, who was already in his花甲year, was lying on a bed with the艳妇of花信年华, and each was only covered in亵服. He ordered both parties to dress and took them back to the police station for detention separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Zhong Qing opened a trial. Zhang Shizhu, the police station's lawyer, recounted the case, stating that the facts of the old monk's adultery with a young woman were確鉴, and asked that he be punished according to the law. Sun Yaohuan recounted that he had been abducted to Shanghai by the monk</p>
<p>Adultery with His Wife</p>
<p>The经过情was brought to the捕获 by报, and also asked Attorney Zhang Fukang to represent him and request that Yingzhao be severely punished, and for Jiang, he念夫妇之情and begged to be免究. The court interrogated Jiang, who admitted to committing adultery with Yingzhao, starting in October last year, and was subsequently威迫to come to Shanghai and live together in a rented house. However, the defendant Yingzhao饰词推諉, and延律师 Wu Linkun and Yu Hualong辩护. After Judge Zhong finished讯, he sentenced Yingzhao to one year in prison for adultery with a married person, and the part about Jiang Meili was不受理. The monk heard the verdict and still asked for bail, but was驳斥, and was escorted away by the detectives and捕.</p>

<p>Pan Ronggao, a Shaoxing native, was employed as a staff member in the Hengchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory opened by Qian Jintang at No. 40 Beishan West Road. The cloth dyed by the factory was usually passed through the China Calendering Factory at No. 59 North Wuxi Road for calendaring procedures. Recently, the factory sent 53 pieces of cloth worth more than 900 yuan to the China Factory for calendaring. However, Pan has recently been</p>

<p>suffered repeated losses, so he had evil intentions. On the 15th of the month, without the order of the factory owner, he went to the China Factory to pick up the goods. The China Factory did not doubt that Pan was indeed a Hengchang staff member, so Pan, after obtaining the goods, pledged these 53 pieces of cloth to the Wanji Pawnshop on Avenier Road, obtaining 600 yuan, and then避不到厂.

<p>For the Convenience of Bets</p>
<p>The English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports that as a result of the active gambling dens in the "badlands" of Shanghai's western district, there is a severe shortage of nickel coins in Shanghai. Smaller gambling dens in the "badlands" all use one yuan as the minimum bet. For the sake of "convenience," they prefer to use nickel coins rather than paper money, because it is easier to stack nickel coins to pay out bets than to check paper money. As a result, the exchange rate for nickel coins in Shanghai's exchange shops, which was previously only a discount of one cent per yuan, is now as high as four or five cents. In other words, one yuan can only be exchanged for 96 cents.</p>

<p>Li Genyin (age 25), a native of Funing, has recently been working as a partner at the Youxin Shoe Store on Xinzha Road. His wife, Xu, became acquainted with Zhang Yongnian, also known as Yuntian, a fellow villager. Zhang is a translator for a Japanese store at 385 Wusong Road, Hongkou. On the 20th, at around 8 p.m., Xu and Zhang left the Haihualou Teahouse on the corner of Haining Road and North Zhejiang Road after having a meal, intending to take a yellow taxi to Hongkou. Li Genyin suddenly appeared from the side and blocked the vehicle.</p>
<p>He pulled out a sharp axe without asking any questions and wounded Zhang and his wife Xu in the arms and shoulders, attempting to flee. Hua, number 701, and a passerby, Xie Rongzhang, heard the alarm and arrived to arrest Li, taking him into custody at the Huike Police Station.

Hua, number 701, arrived, drew his gun, and pointed it at Li, preventing him from moving. I grabbed him around the waist and apprehended him. The defendant confessed that his wife had recently been working as a servant in a Japanese household in Hongkou and had become involved with Zhang, a fellow villager. He stated that he had been waiting on North Sichuan Road and saw his wife and Zhang together, claiming they were returning from a certain hotel. He had already argued with his wife once, telling her to find another employer, but they still could not separate. Therefore, in a moment of anger, he obtained an axe from a stall and a triangular knife.

<h3 id="e88">Finance　Economic Aid to China News Spreads, Cash Plunge Intensifies <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market appeared sluggish and lifeless, with a weak and listless momentum. The price even broke through the 2,120 yuan mark. It was suddenly reported that countries like the United States and the United Kingdom would actively provide economic aid to China. Furthermore, in contrast, the Japanese currency has continued to decline recently, strengthening the confidence of Chinese and foreign people in the legal tender, making its future even brighter. As a result, most speculators felt apprehensive and entrusted money exchange businesses to sell off their holdings. At the same time, silver shops and cash houses (acting as intermediaries) successively sold off their positions, and securities firms (representing northern speculators) also followed suit with aggressive selling. In addition, buyers took the opportunity to push down prices and absorb the supply, leading to a significantly weakened market. Ultimately, the price fell to the day's lowest price of 2,113 yuan at closing, resulting in a further drop of 11 yuan. Although a certain silver shop (representing Hong Kong interests) made purchases at one point, it had no significant impact. Transactions were mediocre, with only about 600 taels changing hands. Silver ornaments followed the decline by 1 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Steep Decline of 11 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial asking price from sellers for each bar (ten taels) was 2,123 to 2,124 yuan, but there were no buyers, causing the price to gradually decrease. At 9:50 AM, the opening price was 2,124 yuan, with cash houses selling 50 taels to money exchange businesses at a price of 2,120 yuan. After the opening, news of active economic aid to China by the United States, the United Kingdom, and other democratic countries suddenly spread, intensifying the selling pressure and breaking through the 20 yuan mark. Cash houses sold 10 taels to silver shops at a price of 19 yuan. Securities firms also began aggressively selling, and buyers seized the opportunity to push down prices and absorb the supply, further weakening the market. Securities firms sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop at a price of 15 yuan. Subsequently, silver shops sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop at the same price. Later, a broker, acting on behalf of a wealthy client, also sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop, also at a price of 15 yuan. Afterwards, securities firms sold 50 taels each to a certain silver shop and a gold shop, both at a price of 14 yuan. After this, the selling pressure eased slightly, and the price rebounded slightly. Silver shops sold 50 taels to money exchange businesses at a price of 16 yuan. Gold shops traded 50 taels among themselves at a price of 15 yuan, and then again at 17 yuan, setting the closing price for the morning session. Transactions became scarcer in the afternoon, and the trend reverted to a downward trajectory. The opening price was immediately 4 yuan lower, with money exchange businesses selling 50 taels to gold shops at a price of 13 yuan. At one point, sellers were asking for 12 yuan, but a certain gold shop suddenly began buying, causing sellers to stop selling and observe, so no transaction occurred. Later, a certain gold shop revised its buying price to 14 yuan, but the willingness of sellers waned, making it difficult to complete transactions. Therefore, the closing price remained at 2,113 yuan, resulting in a net decline of 11 yuan compared to the closing price of last Saturday night. The price fluctuated by 7 yuan throughout the day. The listed selling price of cash houses was 2,120 yuan, and the buying price was 2,110 yuan. The current margin was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed Down One Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold at silver shops initially remained unchanged, but at 10:10 AM, after the cash price broke through the 20 yuan mark, it was lowered by 1 yuan. Dahantong changed its listed price to 215 yuan, and Xinhantong to 213 yuan. Buying prices were all 207 to 208 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash remained at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price for Customs gold remained the same, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained fixed at 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao, due to the London cable on the 20th, which indicated that British pure gold remained at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Eager Selling of Foreign Exchange <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Although foreign firms were buying spot in the foreign exchange market yesterday, local firms were selling, resulting in a stagnant situation without any changes. Initially, after rumors spread that the United States and the United Kingdom would actively provide economic aid to China, the futures market, coupled with the eager selling by Chinese firms such as Shanghai, and the lack of buyers except for speculators and yarn merchants, the situation became somewhat firm. However, it soon reverted. Trading was still active. As for Hong Kong exchange rates, the selling by foreign firms suddenly waned, and the situation became tight.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London telegraphic transfers for both near and far terms decreased by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London gold also remained flat. The exchange rates for British, US, and French currencies against Shanghai remained unchanged. The exchange rates for US currency against British, Shanghai, and French currencies also remained unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. The opening selling prices for spot exchange at banks were 8 pence 25 for British currency and 16 yuan 0625 for US currency, both unchanged from the previous closing prices. After the opening, foreign firms first settled spot British currency at HSBC and Chartered Bank at 8 pence 25, and then settled spot US currency at American banks at 16 yuan 0625. Due to the balance between supply and demand, there were no changes. When HSBC announced that its listed rates would not change, and the silver equalization tax was announced at 2.5%, which is a slight 5.25%, Chinese merchants' speculators settled August British currency at China-Belgian Bank at 8 pence 125, followed by yarn merchants purchasing and settling July US currency at foreign firms at 15 yuan 9375 and buying August US currency at American banks at 15 yuan 875. The situation was still flat. Afterwards, news suddenly spread that the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries would actively provide economic aid to China, resulting in eager selling and a loosening of the futures market. Chinese firm Shanghai sold June US currency to foreign firms at 16 yuan. At the same time, it also sold June British currency to Chinese merchants' speculators at 8 pence 21875. Near noon, transactions in British and US currencies became less active, with only trading in Hong Kong currency. Eastern Bank eagerly bought spot currency at Huayi Bank at only 55 yuan 25. It became more difficult to buy after this, and the situation was quite weak. The banks' selling prices for spot currency at the noon closing were the same as the morning opening for British and US currencies, and only 55 yuan 125 for Hong Kong currency.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign firms continued to buy spot British currency from China-Belgian Bank at 8 pence 25, and then settled spot US currency at American Bank at 16 yuan 0625, and the situation remained flat. Later, Chinese merchants' speculators settled August British currency at Dutch Bank at 8 pence 125, and then bought July British currency at American Bank at 8 pence 1875. At that time, the situation was still slightly loose. Afterwards, a certain bank sold July US currency to foreign firms at 15 yuan 9375, and Huayi Bank also sold August US currency to HSBC at 15 yuan 875. The situation reverted. The Hong Kong currency market was quite calm, and there were no reported transactions. The price was also stable. Until the evening closing, the banks' selling prices for spot currency were 8 pence 25 for British currency and 16 yuan 0625 for US currency. As a result, compared to last Saturday afternoon's closing, spot British and US currency remained unchanged, but near-term contracts loosened. The final selling price for spot Hong Kong currency was 55 yuan 125, a decline of .25.</p>

The opening market prices for the morning are listed below: British currency 8 pence 109375, US currency 15 yuan 8125, Shanghai exchange rate 102 yuan (Shanghai exchange rate is the amount of Shanghai legal tender receivable in Tianjin for 100 yuan).</p>
<p>Another telegram: The gray market exchange rate for "United Bank Notes" compared to the morning opening on the 20th (Saturday) continued to decrease by five jiao. 100 yuan of legal tender can buy 122 yuan and 5 jiao of "United Bank Notes", which means that one yuan of "United Bank Notes" is only worth 0.816326531 of legal tender.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) 22nd telegram. The exchange rates for British, American, and Shanghai currencies in Hong Kong were the same as the prices at 11:30 AM on the 20th (last Saturday). At 11:30 AM, the British currency decreased slightly by 0.03125, with a price of 1 shilling and 2 and 7/8 pence. The US currency also decreased by 0.0625, with a price of 29 yuan. The Shanghai currency decreased slightly by 2.5 jiao, with a price of 180 yuan and 2.5 jiao. At the morning closing, the British currency increased by 0.03125, with a price of 1 shilling and 2 pence and 9/32, and the US currency increased by 0.0625, with a price of 29 yuan and 0.0625.

<p>Japanese Currency Only Worth Nine Jiao</p>
<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold and British and American exchange rates did not change. Yesterday, foreign exchange in this port was actively settled by foreign firms, and the supply from banks was smooth, so the market price was stable without change. When the cash market opened, gold shops were active in selling, and the market situation was weak. Afterwards, wealthy individuals and silver shops sold even more eagerly, and the price became more and more weak. Fortunately, gold shops took the opportunity to absorb at low prices, and the downward trend gradually stopped. In the afternoon, money exchange businesses and wealthy individuals supplied more eagerly, and the market price declined. Foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, and wealthy individuals increased selling trends. Demand was scarce, and prices all declined. British gold notes and Hong Kong notes were in great demand and rose slightly. The supply of US gold notes was relatively smooth, and French franc notes were in demand, and prices all declined. Dutch notes and Annam notes were quite in demand and firm. Japanese gold notes were valued at nine jiao of legal tender, and Korean notes were valued at eight jiao of legal tender. The rapid and disastrous decline of Japanese currency has attracted a lot of attention. In fact, it is inevitable due to the fact that the deficit public debt has reached its peak and non-convertible paper money is being issued without limit, which is the principle of economics. Transactions in the Exchange were very sparse. Only Fuhexian came to Taizin Annam with 100 yuan. Yesterday's market price: British gold pounds fell one jiao, British gold notes rose two fen, American gold pounds fell one jiao and five fen, American gold notes fell five li, Hong Kong notes rose three li, French franc notes fell two hao and five fen, and Dutch and Annam notes each rose one fen. All other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Currencies Linked to Japanese Yen Are Priced Well Below Legal Tender <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Korean notes and "United Bank" notes, which are linked to the Japanese yen, share the same fate as the Japanese yen. In just the past ten days, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against legal tender has gradually fallen, from 1.05 yuan (ie, the number of legal tender exchanged for one yuan of Japanese yen) to 9 jiao, a large decrease of 1 jiao and 5 li. Korean notes have also decreased from 8 jiao 7 fen 5 per yuan of legal tender to 8 jiao, a decrease of 7 fen 5 li. The "United Bank Notes" in North China are rebounding after a sharp decline, but the highest price is a discount of 83.3%, and recently it has returned to 81.6%. The "Huaxing" bank notes newly issued by the Japanese side are not in circulation on the market at all. It is rumored that on the first day of business, 600,000 yuan of legal tender was lost, probably due to stockpiled silver. There are some speculators in the gray market who accept these notes, at less than 60% of legal tender. Although the people in the occupied areas are forced to accept these notes, they are eager to get rid of them.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Securities　Public Bonds are Rising, China Electric Shares Rise Again, Foreign Stock Market Sentiment is Good <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The gray market for securities was stable yesterday. The shorts made some covering, and the rise was slow but firm. Rumors of a new loan from the United States and the United Kingdom made people more excited. Large bullish accounts took the opportunity to push up the price, but the increase was very small. Because the price has been high, the effort to push it up has waned. It is still questionable whether it can break through the 3 yuan mark. At the close, there was news that the Danzig issue was becoming tense again. Yesterday's progress: The morning opening saw Tongshun, Tongkang, and No. 4 buying, Qiafeng, Lianhe, and retail investors selling. Tiansheng was frequently trading in and out, and the market price was slightly higher by 1-2 jiao. In the afternoon, rumors of loans were circulating, with no confirmation. The market price was slightly up again by 1-2 jiao. Qiafeng, Lianhe continued to sell. Tongkang and No. 41 also sold off. There were many retail buyers. The result was slightly better by about 2-3 jiao. The total volume was more than 500,000 yuan. A simple table is below.</p>
<p>Gray market trading: It was initially discussed that the place on the seventh floor was too small, and it was changed to the fifth floor. Temporarily, some people disagreed, resulting in simultaneous trading on the fifth and seventh floors. It is said that a method of mediation is planned to be held on the sixth floor.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Nanshi China Commercial Electric shares were traded, priced at 5 yuan and 6.5 jiao, which is higher than before by several jiao.</p>
<p>Although trading in the public stock market of the public association was not active, the market sentiment was still good. Jardine shares, Kaiping shares and Hutchison Whampoa shares were stable. Ruirong shares rose again to a high price of 7 yuan and 8.5 jiao. It was difficult to see a new high buying price of 205 yuan for Gonghexin shares, and there were no sellers. Reclamation shares were priced at 8 yuan, and demand was very strong. Telephone shares reached a new high, with a buying price of 101 yuan. The market sentiment for corporate bonds continued to be good. 5.5% Power bonds were traded at 88 yuan and 2.5 jiao, and China Business Corporation's 8% bonds were priced at 57 yuan. The rubber stock market had a latent strong rise, but the turnover was limited.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Yarn and Cotton　Hong Kong Merchants Resume Purchasing, Cotton Yarn Market Rises Again, Celestial Maiden and Double Horse Each Rise Seven or Eight Yuan <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned upward, and the rise continues to advance, because the environment has improved, and at the same time, the purchase of cotton from South China and Hong Kong has recovered, and the amount has slightly increased, and the mood on all sides is more determined. It is said that merchants from other places are also in a bullish position, so business is slightly better and the rise is stronger. Although the situation in Minhai is tense for the Shantou merchants, 20-count yarn is traded clearly, but 32-count single yarn is difficult to find, and it is said that most of it is transported to Hunan and Jiangxi for sale. Therefore, other merchants remain stagnant and as weak as usual. In the afternoon, it was heard that the actual need was not bad, and the mood was strong. The 20-count double horse foreign stack spot price reached 428 yuan and 0.5 yuan, but the price of the unpopular 20-count yarn was as dull as ever, and 20-count Five Sons opened at 390 yuan, but it was still not sold.</p>
<p>The situation of spot yarn: At the initial opening in the morning, the market situation was still peaceful. Due to reports of Japanese warships coming and going like shuttles in Minhai, people were exhausted, but Hong Kong merchants made some purchases, but most of them absorbed 32-count yarn, so the opening price of 20-count yarn was increased by 5 jiao, and the double horse spot price was 422 yuan. Hong Kong merchants entered 30 packages, and the stack price was increased by 2 yuan, to 417 yuan and 0.5 yuan. Halfway through, because the needs of Hong Kong and Shantou merchants were still not weak, the market rose again, but 20-count yarn was still flat, and the rise of 32-count single yarn was very strong. The closing price of the double horse stack was 417 yuan, and the foreign stack price was 424 yuan. In the afternoon, sales to customers were not bad, and the market price advanced slowly. The double horse stack was made to 421 yuan and 0.5 yuan, and the spot closing price was 428 yuan and 0.5 yuan. It is found that the statistics of the various merchants buying 2,100 packages throughout the day show that the price of double horse rose by 7 yuan, the price of Celestial Maiden rose by 8 yuan, the price of Double Earth rose by 2.5 yuan, and the price of 32-count single yarn rose by 3-4 yuan. The factory opened 30 packages of 32-count Flying Tiger from Anda Factory, priced at 530 yuan. Today, 75 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin. The amount of each merchant bought is listed as left,</p>
<p>Shantou 360, Peer 900</p>
<p>Mainland 105, Hong Kong 735</p>
<p>Statistics 2,100</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market has fallen for many days in a row. Yesterday, the reaction suddenly rose sharply. At the same time, there were many rumors that the Qingdao Exchange had a strong upward trend. Therefore, Shanghai was affected, but the actual business was still mediocre and weak. The monthly price of 20-count Yueqin brand wooden yarn was 355 yuan, which was an increase of 6-7 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Limited Production, Brazilian Cotton Telegram Increases Price, Approximately 1 Yuan Increase per Load <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was quite stagnant and small, and trading was also very quiet. There was only a small amount of short covering. Later, due to good news from Liverpool, the closing price rebounded by 1-2 pounds. However, recent and spot prices fell by 2-3 pounds. In Washington, there is no appropriate solution for the disposal of loan cotton. According to various reports, it is difficult to release the loan cotton in the past few weeks, so the price of July and spot prices may continue to rise. India, including the forecast, fell by 3 rupees, Egypt closed its market, converted to legal tender, the price of US cotton fell by 0.3 yuan per load, the price of Indian cotton fell by 1.25 yuan, and the Egyptian market remained unchanged.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai port foreign cotton market, because the goods arriving in various places in recent days have been very crowded, and the Indian cotton ordered by the industry has also poured in, they have been vigorously promoting it in the market for days. The overseas cotton market has risen sharply every day, and the price of the order is cheaper than the spot price. Each factory has very few spot transactions, and the factories are waiting quietly for the cotton price to fall before talking about transactions. Therefore, the cotton market has been quiet for more than a week, and it is feared that there will be no large-scale transactions this week. Yesterday, Brazil sent a telegram that because the production in that place is limited, the number of previous orders is huge, and it is feared that it will be difficult to purchase locally, so another telegram was sent to increase the price, and each piece was increased by more than one yuan. The conversion of yesterday's cotton market to delivery to the factory is as follows,</p>
<p>The business of local cotton has disappeared again, and not a single bag has been sold. However, the foreign cotton industry still has the appetite, and the factories have a slight need. As for the source of northern Jiangsu, it is still quiet. It is found that the total number of goods arriving in the past two days is 375 packages of Tongzhou Xiansha, and 112 packages of cotton from Beisha. The situation of the current cotton is recorded as left,</p>
<h3 id="e96">Piece Goods　After Ningbo Resumes Sailing, Inquiries About Cloth Prices Have Risen, Postal Packages to Sichuan and Yunnan Are Still Not Accepted, and Southwest Trade Has Stalled <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Recently, the emergency preparedness in the concession has been lifted, people's hearts have stabilized, and domestic and foreign yarns and cotton have rebounded. Cloth has been in a tired state for a long time. Now that the environment has improved, Guangdong and Zhejiang merchants' current sales have been linked, and the market has gradually stabilized after the fall. Yesterday, coarse cloth and manual goods continued to fall by 5 fen per piece, and the price of bleached and dyed cloth and fine cloth twill were stable. Zhejiang merchants in Wenzhou, Jinhua and other ports bought coarse Jardine cloths, fine Shenxin Yong'an Dawei and other factory cloths, and a total of 200 pieces of each factory's colored twill and colored cloth. Since the resumption of navigation to Ningbo, letters have inquired about cloth prices, and there is an intention to handle it. Guangdong merchants have resumed handling about 200 pieces of white goods, fine cloth, and bleached and dyed fine cloth twill poplin printed goods. Large postal packages to Sichuan and Yunnan are still not allowed to be received by the post office, and it is difficult for coastal ships to accommodate them, so customers must postpone delivery. There is no intention to purchase new goods, so transactions are still stalled. The wholesale business of shops and mainland merchants in this street can still be maintained. Today, there are 55 pieces of cloth transported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>East Cloth</p>
<p>The market sentiment for white goods has turned firm, and fine cloth and fine twill are selling well due to active actual sales. The opening price of Abe City Foreign Company of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth in the morning market was 200 packages, which gradually increased from 13 yuan and 5 jiao to 6 jiao. The futures of the Lower Month for Treasure fine twill requires 12 yuan and 1 jiao, which has risen by 1 jiao and 5 fen compared to last week. The recovery of Four Gentlemen's serge in colored goods is also rapid. Yesterday, the price was called 4 jiao and 2.5 fen per yard. Tianjin merchants handled 400 pieces of white goods. The current and futures transactions in this street totaled 1,500 pieces. The market situation is quite stable.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Many Woolen Fabrics Are Placed <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's woolen fabric transactions were quite prosperous. The weather is hot, and the business of the shop and the Western clothing industry has improved, which has led to the continued rise in various summer wool, cotton, and linen fabrics that are needed for the season. Therefore, the idea of placing orders is stronger than before. The machine customers of countries such as Britain and Italy have accepted many special orders, most of which are spring goods to be shipped in December and January. 12,000 pieces of 3 shillings and 11.5 pence, 7,000 pieces of 5 shillings and 4 pence, and printed woolen fabrics with Western characters on the sides are placed in large numbers. And in view of the prevalence of vegetable green, there is a considerable amount of fixed agreements.</p>

<p>Foreign silk market: Yokohama's near and distant futures reports show a slight increase. The spot price of 1,288 yuan rose by 8 yuan, the near-term price of 1,285 yuan rose by 10 yuan, and the distant-term price of 1,202 yuan rose by 11 yuan. New York and Lyon closed yesterday. This port's silk transactions were still more active in the French market. The white factory XB 20-22 pattern was sold at 1800-1810 yuan, which has risen by 10 yuan compared to last weekend. Yesterday, Kailixin, Furenchang jointly entered 150 loads. In addition, gray Jing Shuang Palace, which has not been sold for a long time, also had the same transaction. The silk price rose by 20 yuan compared to the previous transaction. Yinzhuang Muzhen silk, Samsung Meida and other companies entered 30 loads. Only the white factory 7-8 points are sold to the United States. It has been stopped for a long time. Yesterday, an electricity price of 1850 yuan was issued, but we still need to look at the New York incoming account.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 780 pieces of tea came from Hong Kong, and 1,569 pieces came from Wenzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Food　Flour Factory Attention　North China Market　After Depreciation, Tianjin Sales Gradually Activate　Wholesale Prices in This Street Fall Together <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ben Flour Factory's market publicly depreciated the No. 2 flour customer's market. After the depreciation last weekend, this street also asked for a reduction, so since yesterday, the wholesale price in this street has also been reduced to 4 yuan and 4 jiao in cash. The selling price of Nanyang merchants is still 4 yuan and 4.5 jiao. Because the Nanyang merchants need retail, the factory does not care about it. What they pay attention to is the North China market. It was heard yesterday that the disposal in Tianjin has gradually become active, and approximately 30,000 packages of continued Kai soldiers' ships and gun carriages have been continued. The number of domestic and Nanyang merchants in this street is approximately 20,000 packages. However, at present, customer sales are still on a trial basis, so the market is slightly uneven. It is said that 10,000 packages of flour will be transported to Tianjin on the 23rd.</p>
<p>The market situation for foreign flour is also depressed. It is found that foreign orders are still not planned, futures have been lacking in transactions for a long time, and the current flour that has arrived in the market, except for most of it being directly distributed to customers, the remaining goods have been stranded in the Northern Ocean for a long time. There is also little care in the mainland of this street, and the factory flour has also fallen sharply. The market has fallen. It is said that it is not easy to sell it at a low price. As a result, 30,000 packages of transactions such as bats, ships, and gun emplacements were made, all of which were handled by Tianjin merchants at a price of 4 yuan and 5 jiao. It is heard that nearly 10,000 packages of retail transactions in this street were also made.</p>
<h3 id="e100">New Wheat Harvest Is Promising, Old Wheat Continues to Arrive <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market transactions were still not progressing. Recently, the supply from the mainland has been constant, because the old wheat is gradually falling due to the order, the market price in the producing area is frequently loose, and this year's new wheat harvest looks good, and the morale of the people is weak. Each flour factory has long been disappointed in its appetite, and only relying on the Japanese merchants has made the market boring. It was heard yesterday that Japanese merchants added 3-400 bags each of Nanjing and Chuzhou wheat at a price of 6 yuan and 3 jiao. Among the goods delivered to the factory, Jue wheat was sold for only 6 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Saigon Rice　2,000 Tons Officially Traded <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>There has been talk on the market for some time about tacit agreements on foreign rice orders, but formal transactions did not take place until yesterday when 2,000 tons of Saigon were traded. The original package of 100 kilograms was priced at 19 yuan and 4 jiao, and was sold by Dafu Foreign Company, and it was handled by the four firms Shuntai, Shunfeng, Zhengda and Houde. As for the next batch of transactions, they are still being discussed by telegram. If we can continue to reach an agreement, it can be confirmed this week.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Customer Hoarding Sells Out, Gengxian Prices Rebound Slightly <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Du Geng Yesterday, customers from other regions came to He Xia, Songjiang and Nangang near No. 10, with more than 4,000 packages of Wheelbarrow Dumpling Su Tong Kunshan. The overall situation seems to be hovering. Because the price limit for each type of goods has been eliminated in an invisible way, according to the current behavior, it seems that it has reached the top, and because the source has gradually become clear, the morale of the people is inevitably turning flat, so the sales market in this street turned lazy again yesterday, and the hoarders mostly sold out, making it difficult for the market to stand. As a result, the price of thick and thin geng fell by 1.5 to 2 jiao, and Changbai geng only opened 17 yuan and 6 jiao. However, the trend in the late market was more active. Du Yang Jian Bujian followed the Geng market by a small jiao. The destination for Ke Jian was more stagnant, and the middle section was reduced by 2-3 jiao. Bian Yuan Yuan fell by 2 jiao at the same time. There were few inquiries about foreign glutinous rice, and the market continued to be tired.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Yesterday, the week's trading started with Ke Tuan coming to Liangchong to offer samples for sale. It happened that there was news that a new agreement had been reached on foreign rice, and Geng Jian also fell. The market followed the mood and went down, and more customers were watching. Xin Tuan was willing to be lazy, and the total number of transactions in the market was less than 4,000 packages, most of which were handled by retail households in this street. The price was less than 2-3 jiao from the previous market. The high-end Bing was guarded and not opened, and Zhongjue was soft. The price of Juqi Juqi reached as low as 13 yuan, and the price of Ke Yuan foreign glutinous rice also fell by 2-3 jiao because of the excessive number of small sales.</p>
<p>Also reported yesterday (22nd), 3,470 packages of rice came to Shanghai from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Although the stock of soybeans is not too thick, the source is still uninterrupted, and the actual sales are not rising, so it is difficult to rise, and the market is frequently falling. At the moment, the Xi Chang gang is affected by the direct impact of Lian Dou. The market price in that port is still lower than the Shanghai market, so the destination in this port has not improved. However, if the market in this city can be further reduced, the destination in that gang may have approaching hope. Yesterday's market Dalian Dou, the price was still opened at 8 yuan and 7 jiao, with 200 packages traded. Duzhi Sha Huang fell by 3-4 fen, opened 60 packages of Zhang Yan Du Dou, priced at 10 yuan, and 50 packages of Chongming Sha Huang at 8 yuan and 9 jiao. Only the Han Kou Zha Dou fell by 2 jiao and 5 fen compared to last Thursday, with more than 600 packages traded, priced at 8 yuan and 5 fen, which is nothing more than the reason why the goods are abundant and the sales are sluggish.</p>
<p>1,300 packages of beans came from Tianjin on the 22nd.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was firm and stable. The guild set the price for the best quality coarse white sugar at 27.5 yuan at this shop, and 27.4 yuan at other shops, an increase of two jiao. Transshipment goods rose to 19.3 yuan, with 1,200 bags transacted. Goods arriving by ship on June 3rd rose by five fen to 19.4 yuan, with 300 bags transacted.

<p>Due to seasonal factors, Hunan lotus seeds, if not stored in refrigerated warehouses, are prone to softening and spoilage. Coupled with sluggish sales, they are susceptible to price drops. It is reported that the private market price for this year's Hunan lotus seeds has fallen to 80 yuan, a sharp drop of more than ten yuan compared to before. Retailers are firmly asking for 80 yuan, but finalized prices are only around 50 yuan. Compared to the highest price, the difference is said to be thirty to forty yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price surge in peanut oil was stronger than that of soybean oil. Soybean oil relied mainly on support from bullish companies, resulting in a tight exterior but loose interior. Peanut oil prices rose rapidly due to high costs and domestic transportation. Yesterday, it was estimated that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw peanut oil were transacted at prices ranging from 42 to 43 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan compared to last week. Eighty barrels of Dalian barrelled raw peanut oil were transacted at 42.5 to 43 yuan, also up one yuan. The stockpiling and sales of Dalian soybean oil totaled over 1,200 barrels, with current prices at 40 yuan for spot goods and 39.8 yuan for goods en route. Additionally, twenty barrels of bleached oil were sold at 41 yuan, and fifty barrels of "Harvest Year" oil were sold at 39.4 to 39.6 yuan.

<p>The long-dormant yellow steel wire has recently seen a surge in demand because spring factories, thermos factories, and iron bed factories in this street are all opening or expanding, leading to concerns that popular varieties will be completely sold out. However, merchants from other locations don't have much of a need for it. It's estimated that over 500 dan were offered yesterday, resulting in a shortage of circulating goods on the market and a rise in prices. Currently, coarse varieties are priced at 18 yuan per dan, medium varieties at 19 yuan per dan, and fine varieties at 20 yuan per dan. As for mixed varieties, they are priced at around 16 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>The highest price for bitter almonds once reached 71 or 72 yuan, prompting merchants to continuously ship goods to Shanghai. It has been found that previously, those without permits were already selling at 52 yuan. Yesterday, a certain store received over thirty bags, opening them at 47 yuan. However, the store still has 300 bags in stock, and due to cost considerations, they are only willing to sell them at 50 yuan. Furthermore, production prices are unlikely to loosen, so the overall trend is expected to stabilize.</p>

<h3 id="e109">My Life as a Doctor (Part 1) <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Looking back, it has been a full ten years since I left medical school, entered society, and took on the role of a doctor. In these ten years, which are neither too long nor too short, there are indeed many things that can be written about. Now, I want to write about some of the characteristics of a doctor's life that I have felt over the years, as well as some miscellaneous thoughts, as a souvenir of my ten years as a doctor.</p>
<p>The profession of a doctor is classified by people in society as a liberal profession. I am not sure of the exact meaning of the term "liberal profession." I don't know if it is because this profession is considered to be more free and comfortable compared to other professions? However, there are indeed many people in society who secretly admire the profession of a doctor, regarding our lives as doctors as very leisurely and fulfilling. Often, when friends gather and chat over tea and cigarettes, when discussing career lives, they express their admiration and praise for the life of a doctor: "Being a doctor is the best, you are the one being sought after, not the one seeking," "A doctor's life is so free and comfortable!" "The profession of a doctor is so meaningful!"... In the beginning, even when I myself had not yet become a doctor and had not tasted the life of a doctor, I somewhat held this kind of mentality and had this kind of thought. However, after I joined the ranks of the medical profession and tasted the life of a doctor, I realized that my previous ideal of a doctor's life was inaccurate: in fact, the taste of a doctor's life is not as free and comfortable, as fulfilling as imagined.</p>
<p>Just taking the word "free" as an example, most professions have plenty of free time outside of work events: A doctor's life—at least for a large part of doctors—is different: in addition to engaging in diagnosis and treatment during consultation hours, in the event of special emergencies outside of consultation hours, they must also come to diagnose and treat. In the middle of the night, when people in various professions are having sweet dreams, a doctor is often unexpectedly visited by a patient with an emergency, and must wake up from a sweet dream to perform treatment. In the hot summer, many people in professional jobs can stop working and take a summer break, but for doctors, due to the increase in heat-related illnesses, their work becomes even busier. In the hot summer months, very few doctors stop seeing patients to take a summer break. This is in terms of tangible work; a doctor's life is not as leisurely and free as most people imagine. As for responsibility, because the object of a doctor's work is the patient, that is, bearing the heavy responsibility for the life and death of the patient, its importance is evident. If the treatment is successful, that is the doctor's duty; if the treatment is unsuccessful, although it is due to the incurable nature of the disease, not due to the doctor's lack of effort or improper treatment, sometimes the doctor will still be blamed by the patient's family. Especially given the current situation in China, due to the majority of patients' lack of understanding of modern medicine, incidents of lawsuits against doctors are more likely to occur. Therefore, speaking of the doctor's life itself, I can use the four words "busy and responsible" to describe it.</p>
<p>A doctor's "busy and responsible" life is indeed a fact, but is the remuneration that doctors receive in society more abundant than that of people in other industries? Indeed, many people in society must regard the profession of a doctor as an easy way to get rich and make a fortune. I don't think that's quite right. Apart from the relatively affluent income of a few upper-class doctors, most doctors, especially lower-class doctors who are loyal to their duties and without the character of a charlatan, are no better off than people in other professions. Generally speaking, the income of an average middle-class doctor may be slightly more than that of an average middle-class professional, but a doctor's essential expenses are also relatively large. For example, if an average middle-class doctor has a monthly income of 300 yuan, but the essential expenses of the clinic at home, etc., require 350 yuan, they will feel the danger of not being able to make ends meet; this is not as good as an average professional who earns 200 yuan a month and only needs 150 or 160 yuan for family expenses.</p>
<p>Does this mean that a doctor's life has become a very uninteresting and meaningless profession? That's not the case either. Apart from a portion of people who are burdened by life and do not understand the true meaning of a doctor's life, there are also many who have a strong sense of meaning and supreme interest in a doctor's life. As for myself, I can say that I have a strong interest in a doctor's life. This interest and meaning are definitely not in the material rewards, or in how free or leisurely a doctor's life is. Where is my life's interest? First, it lies in the significance of medical work itself; when I see a patient, make an accurate diagnosis, and provide correct treatment, and the patient is cured as a result, my spirit gains supreme comfort and victory. This kind of spiritual comfort and victory cannot be compared to material rewards. When I see a patient who has not yet been diagnosed, or when the diagnosis cannot be determined, I have no choice but to further explore and investigate. In the process of thinking about and exploring the cause and symptoms of the disease, interest will arise spontaneously. If, after deep thinking and research, the cause of the disease is finally found, then regardless of the difficulty of treating the disease, there will always be a correct direction for treatment. At this time, my spirit also feels unspeakable joy. Down the line, if the treatment results are good and the disease is cured, it is truly better than winning a charitable lottery; even if the treatment is not good and the patient ultimately cannot be saved, I have lived up to the patient in terms of responsibility, and I have lived up to myself in terms of conscience and duty. This kind of spiritual victory and peace of mind are the most valuable gains for those who live the life of a doctor: anyone who has a deep understanding of the significance of the doctor's work can feel it.</p>

<h3 id="e110">A Brief Discussion of Measles <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(Measles is also known as Shazi or Yizi)</p>
<p>How is measles transmitted?</p>
<p>The pathogen of measles exists in the secretions and blood of the nasal and oral mucosa of sick children. The route of transmission is direct spread of the secretions from the mouth and nose of a sick child to the body of another healthy child, and indirect spread from the media of healthy people or the clothes, bedding, utensils, and other items used by sick children. The ability to infect is very strong, especially during the rash period. It's a little worse later.</p>
<p>The period when children are most susceptible to measles</p>
<p>Generally, children under one month of age are less likely to contract measles. The period from one to five years of age is the most susceptible to infection. Especially children from one to two years old. After the age of fifteen, it is rare. Once you have had measles, you can be immune for life. No longer contagious.</p>
<p>Within a year, the spring and autumn seasons are the most prevalent.</p>
<p>Symptoms of measles</p>
<p>After contracting measles, it takes about ten days to develop a fever, and the rash appears three days after the fever. The fever subsides four or five days after the rash appears. Therefore, the entire course of measles can be divided into four stages.</p>
<p>(1) Incubation period: 10 to 11 days: Healthy children have no abnormalities during this period.</p>
<p>(2) Prodromal period: Also known as the mucosal inflammation period, lasting three to four days. During this period, the whole body develops a fever, and symptoms such as conjunctivitis, pharyngeal mucosal inflammation, and nasal mucosal inflammation appear. This results in sneezing, coughing, and photophobia. Although the rash has not yet appeared during this period, mucosal rashes can be seen in the oral mucosa. The most important diagnostic target is a rash called "Koplik's spots." This is a small white spot that appears on the buccal mucosa opposite the molars within one or two days after the fever, slightly raised and surrounded by a red halo.</p>
<p>Appearing simultaneously or slightly later than Koplik's spots is the soft palate mucosa, especially the mucosa near the uvula, which develops pinhead-sized, irregular, dark red mucosal rashes. These mucosal rashes are very short-lived and soon disappear. And they are often lacking and invisible.</p>
<p>(3) Eruptive period: By the fourteenth day after infection, the initial rash appears behind the ears and on the face, starting small and gradually becoming larger. The largest rash is the size of a pea. This rash gradually spreads to the head, torso, and limbs. The rash covers the entire body one and a half to two days after it appears.</p>
<p>Many people have a fever of 40 degrees Celsius. Consciousness is impaired, and infants may have convulsions. If the mucosal inflammation worsens, bronchitis often occurs. In addition, there may be diarrhea and lymph node swelling.</p>
<p>(4) Recovery period is the desquamation period. At the end of the rash period, the body temperature drops within one or two days. Systemic symptoms also improve.</p>
<p>The fading of the rash is in the same order as the appearance of the rash. Then the skin flakes off. (commonly known as peeling) The very small flakes finish falling off in three to seven days.</p>
<p>During measles, the mucous membranes of almost all organs in the body are affected. Therefore, various symptoms appear; the general situation is as follows: (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Various Types of Vitamin Deficiency Diseases <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Guangdi</p>
<p>Someone asked why everyone eats white rice, but not everyone develops beriberi. The answer is that our food is very complex. In addition to rice, there are also supplements of vegetables, fish, and meat. But what supplements are there besides rice for refugees and prisoners? Therefore, eating white rice leads to illness. So what can be done to remedy this? The answer is to change to eating brown rice, supplemented with bran powder, wheat bran, adzuki beans, mung beans, peanuts, etc.</p>
<p>(1) Vitamin C deficiency: also known as scurvy. It is caused by a lack of fresh vegetables, meat, and fruit. It causes swelling and decay of the gums, ulceration of the oral cavity, and easy bleeding of internal and external membranes, resulting in subcutaneous bleeding spots, purpura, lumps, and systemic weakness, anemia, and mental dullness. This is called scurvy. Infants who are only fed canned milk powder will also develop the same disease. In addition, all febrile infectious diseases, especially pneumonia and tuberculosis, greatly increase the body's need for this element. Therefore, it is also necessary in treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Vitamin A deficiency: Various animal fats contain the most of this. Fish liver oil is one of them. Others include milk, egg yolk, and the green parts of vegetables. But vegetable oil does not contain it. When the human body is undernourished and lacks this element, it can cause hair loss, rough skin, bad nails, inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva, and inflammation and swelling of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, digestive tract, and reproductive organs. The most obvious is night blindness. Tuberculosis patients often take this element because they lose weight rapidly and consume too much, in order to increase resistance.</p>
<p>(3) Vitamin D deficiency: This element is essential for metabolism in the human body. It is needed by both the old and the young. It is indispensable during the development period and during pregnancy and lactation. Since nursing mothers, pregnant women, and infants have universally adopted this element, rickets and osteomalacia in children have been reduced by 90%. But most people often lack this element due to malnutrition, and still need a large amount of supplementation.</p>
<p>The above four vitamins are the main components of nutrition. Other vitamins have recently been discovered.</p>
<p>Vitamin E is oil-soluble and is extracted from malt powder. It is an essential element for conception in mice, and in humans, it has the effect of preventing miscarriage.</p>
<p>Vitamin F is acidic linoleic acid. It is an essential element for the development and reproduction of mice.</p>
<p>Vitamin G is extracted from Vitamin B. Its symbol is B2. In the past, clinicians referred to it as being able to treat pellagra. But it has now been proven that this disease is caused by a lack of nicotinic acid. Black tongue in dogs and pellagra in humans can be cured with nicotinic acid.</p>
<p>Vitamin H is a derivative of amino acids. If mice lack this element, they will develop seborrheic dermatitis. It has a similar relationship to eczema and similar skin inflammations in humans.</p>
<p>Vitamin K is a clotting factor that resists bleeding. It is a normal chicken blood coagulant. It is heat-resistant and oil-soluble, so it is different from Vitamins A, D, and E. This element is contained in green vegetables, pig liver oil, hemp seeds, spinach, alfalfa, fish, and meat. According to recent reports, giving bile and alfalfa to patients with bleeding can greatly increase their blood clotting ability. Someone used it to treat hemorrhagic jaundice and achieved remarkable results. (End)</p>

<p>— Sizhai</p>
<p>Caput Medusae</p>
<p>In liver cirrhosis, there is collateral circulation. At this time, the umbilical vein left over from fetal life conducts blood from the portal vein trunk to the navel. One side flows through the superior epigastric vein and internal mammary vein back to the superior vena cava, and the other side flows through the inferior epigastric vein, saphenous vein, and femoral vein into the inferior vena cava. Therefore, a special morphology occurs; its shape is similar to the head of the goddess in Greek mythology, and it is called caput medusae.</p>
<p>Familial Appendicitis</p>
<p>In the same family, there are often many people suffering from appendicitis. This is called familial appendicitis, because appendicitis is related to lifestyle.</p>
<p>Carcinomatous Peritonitis</p>
<p>If the intestine has cancer, when it presses or pulls adjacent organs, it induces pain and blood circulation disorders in the compressed organ, or secondarily develops peritoneal cancer and causes localized or generalized peritonitis. This is the so-called carcinomatous peritonitis.</p>

<h3 id="e113">The "New" of "New Poetry" <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqi</p>
<p>The so-called "new poetry," from a certain point of view, does have "new" forms, "new" styles, "new" emotions, and "new" meanings; but what remains in the minds of ordinary people as "new poetry" is just "vernacular written in lines." In fact, the "new" of "new poetry" is by no means just writing in lines, or using vernacular sentences; because "new poetry" is not only "new," but also "poetry."</p>
<p>I remember that Mr. Ke wrote an article on poetry, in which there was a famous saying that is still worth mentioning as a new saying.</p>
<p>He said: "Anything that involves seeing scenery, generating emotions, sensing time, lamenting events, singing about objects, conveying metaphors, chanting in response, or giving gifts cannot be considered new poetry."</p>
<p>His meaning is: you can't find anything "new" by circling in the old circle, and "new" things will never hide in the old circle. "New poetry" jumped out of the old circle of "old poetry"; having jumped out, of course, there is no need to turn back and stick a foot back in, so that there is only a new format, but no new nature. For example, ancient people loved to write poems recording the life of secluded mountain forests, all because their lives could have the life of secluded mountain forests. They sat by springs in pavilions, dipped their brushes in ink, and naturally wrote about such secluded things. If this thing is put in an old frame, it is naturally "old poetry." But if today's poets also write poems about secluded hermitages, it is immediately obvious that they have been fooled by the ancients and have fallen into the old clichés of the ancients. Where can we now find secluded mountain forests to retire to? Even if we find them, can we live in seclusion peacefully? And can we write poetry leisurely? Unfortunately, today's world does not allow such things.</p>
<p>However, too realistic goods are all vulgar objects in the eyes of poets. Western-style houses, cars, and airplanes are all considered "scientific" and unworthy of being put into poetry! So, the "new" poets began to wander, learning from the ancients was not suitable, and taking out their own things was too vulgar, so they had to turn around and around on women's mouths. And what about the so-called "new poetry"? The format is "new," the subject matter is "new," but after being "new," it falls into another "old" situation.</p>
<p>"New" becomes "old" is a representative of "before" and "after." When I see the line written in lines, "Alas! My hometown!", I only see a piece of "old" and a pile of "backwardness." If this is also considered "new poetry," then I really have to start doubting it.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you write a marching song, even if the "poetic" meaning is less, the "new" flavor may be able to stay a little more; then at least it can give me a little "new" feeling.</p>
<p>It seems that some people think that if a poem is written in a foreign format, it is new even if it is not new. This really makes me cringe! "New poetry" has finally jumped out of the shackles of the "old poetry" style. If it drills into a foreign cage again, it is inevitable that it cannot completely become "new." I personally feel that if "new poetry" wants to put on foreign shackles, it is actually better to use the style of ci. Because since you are afraid that there will be problems without shackles, then why not be content and not jump out of the inherent form, as long as you find "new" in nature and soul. And at this time, on the old form and old style, not only do you not have to ignore them, but you should even pay more attention to them. You must be able to find "old" in the "old" before you can create a new soul. And blindly seeing scenery, generating emotions, sensing time, lamenting events, singing about objects, conveying metaphors, and chanting in response, always playing and playing this set, even if the person is a "new" person, the poem is still an "old poem."</p>
<p>Now, let me quote a few sentences from Eliot's "Tradition and the Individual Talent" to make it clear: "No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead. I mean this as a principle of æsthetic, not merely historical, criticism. The necessity that he shall conform, that he shall cohere, is not onesided; the more truly new work of art is a creation, the more completely is it formed and the more complete the transformation of the existing order. The existing order is complete before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the whole existing order must be, if ever so slightly, altered; and so the relations, proportions, values of each work of art toward the whole are readjusted; and that is what happens when a new work of art is created and when new and old adapt each other."</p>

<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>"You have a new mission. You must cross the river today. There is a boat docked at Shangxinhe. Go find the General Logistics Department." The department director said calmly and seriously. It was difficult to gauge the fate of the front line from his expressionless face.</p>
<p>"Then let's go!" I took from the director's banana-like palm enough living expenses to sustain our group for half a year.</p>
<p>Blankets, food bags, thermos bottles, fully armed, like a camel on an expedition. There was no joy or sorrow on the faces of the comrades, their expressions were still so calm. Saying goodbye to the director and the staff of another department, we were spat out from the mouth of this large monster. The weak sun was hanging overhead, it was noon, but we hadn't even thought about getting a few sweets. We exited Yijiang Gate and stepped onto the pond embankment full of reeds; every five or six steps there was a deep pit. We saw eagle claws above, but we didn't avoid them.</p>
<p>It was already evening when we arrived at Shangxinhe. It was a small town by the river, where we could no longer see any shops with open doors, but the common people were still sparsely found on the streets.</p>
<p>"Who knows when we'll be back here after leaving today?" Across from where we stood, an old woman in a tofu shop was laboriously moving a large vat; but there was no sorrow on her face.</p>
<p>"One day this place will still be ours. Just wait!" A young man, probably her son, was actively helping to move things, his spirits were extremely high.</p>
<p>They looked at us, with honest and simple smiles, but there was no conversation. They were too busy.</p>
<p>After two hours of searching all the nearby small harbors, we didn't find a trace of our boat. The sun had been completely swallowed by the earth, and the surroundings were eerily quiet; punctuated only by the approaching, dense machine-gun fire, and intermittent small cannon fire.</p>
<p>"Report, officer!" A brother covered in mud and ash suddenly ran up, the sweat on his forehead dripping down, his chest a large wet patch, carrying a gun, still panting.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"May I ask where our machine gun company is? The battalion commander ordered me to notify them to prepare for battle. The enemy is only two li away from here..." he said quickly.</p>
<p>"We don't know that. We are from the ___ department; please ask at the front of the mountain," we expressed our sincere apologies for not being able to give him an answer.</p>
<p>However, this sudden news was so stimulating. Should we wait? Or return to the city? Two questions swirled in the minds of each comrade. Finally, we decided: if we encountered them along the way, we would actively exert our power.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an officer in a black military uniform ran up from afar:</p>
<p>"Are you ___ commander? Is the division commander ___?" He looked at our unit number and said. He was quite young, the local police chief; due to his duties, he was still searching and patrolling in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Yes!" we replied in unison. Although the words were so simple, everyone was filled with enthusiasm, and everyone had this common thought in their hearts:</p>
<p>"If we encounter them, then we will have this officer with rich military knowledge to contact each other."</p>
<p>We gathered around him and chatted randomly, he was very familiar with the situation of our division.</p>
<p>"—You'd better go back to the city." He spoke very slowly. Perhaps he was afraid that we didn't know the situation here yet.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid we can't go back to the city either!" We called the discerning comrade Xiao Kai.</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily true, there is a shortcut from here to Shuixi Gate, it only takes six or seven li to reach. He looked at his watch, "Oh—7:30. Judging from the time, the city bridge may not have been blown up before you reach the city gate."</p>
<p>He carefully told us the ordinary and special passwords; and drew a clear map.</p>
<p>For the sake of our mission, we left him.</p>
<p>On the broken and uneven brick road flowed crowds of refugees and armed comrades.</p>
<p>Dense machine gun fire, mixed with small cannons; children's cries, accompanied by dog barks; the hissing of bullets and the sound of whistles playing in unison, the sky was even darker. But the area around the city was ablaze with a prairie fire, the red light illuminating the sky.</p>
<p>We passed through with hurried breaths and quickened steps.</p>
<p>The outline of the city bridge could still be distinguished in the fiery light, and we breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The city bridge was covered with explosives and wires: it would complete its mission in a very short time and destroy itself.</p>
<p>Led by an officer from friendly forces, we crossed the fully armed city bridge.</p>
<p>We were thrown back into the embrace of the ancient city, and our pace slowed down a lot. (Proceeds from Charity Sale)</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Qi's "New Poetry"'s "newness" arriving before Mr. Xing Guangzu's "Defense of New Poetry" is purely coincidental that everyone is discussing new poetry at the same time, and is not aimed at "Defense of New Poetry". I should declare this here.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Unreasonable <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Fu</p>
<p>Although humans are the "spirit of all things" and surpass all things in every way, it is a pity that they have not completely escaped the scope of "all things", and still retain some "thing" nature, being unreasonable.</p>
<p>It would be fine if unreasonableness came from illiterate people, commoners, or barbarians, because these people are often treated as "all things" by society and deprived of the elegant title of "spirit", but unfortunately, unreasonableness can also come from scholars, high-ranking officials, or people who claim to be civilized, and the degree of unreasonableness of the latter sometimes seems to be even worse than the former.</p>
<p>In the past, those who plotted to seize land, rape women, and monopolize lawsuits, implementing "what is yours is mine, and what is mine is untouchable", were they not all scholars? "Magistrates" could "set fires", while "common people" could not "light lamps"; "a ruler must die when his subject is ordered to die, and a father must die when his son is ordered to die"; "there are no wrong parents in the world"; when an imperial edict came down, those who were slowly executed were still required to kneel three times and kowtow nine times to "thank the emperor" and accept death... All of this was either "sophistry" or harming the "principles" of nature, only slightly better than blocking the road and robbing, demanding "toll money", or having a teahouse "adjudicating" before a full-scale armed fight.</p>
<p>Now, it's even worse, perhaps it's indeed an increase in degree. Let's not talk about anything else, just look at the countries that claim to be the most civilized, their unreasonableness has simply created a new record, not only unprecedented, but also unsurpassed, leaving later generations far behind. They want to destroy other countries at every turn, encompass the lands of other countries, trample on and plunder innocent people, seize all movable property of others, disregard all treaties and agreements, are unwilling to engage in "reasonable" consultation, negotiation, or discussion, and even ignore calls, entreaties, and pleas to them, doing things their own way. What is especially hateful is that they still claim that this is for peace; this is for the stability of a certain region; this is for the happiness of the world: their ruthlessness, wickedness, and violence have truly reached the point where they are beyond "reason"! It's truly like the saying, "The plum tree" is planted in front of their door, therefore, the "reason" in the world is only this one—the Trinity family—and there is no division.</p>
<p>Some "gentlemen", claiming to be kind-hearted, believe that there is only one "right reason" in the world, but there are thousands of "wrong reasons", and they choose to walk where there are more of them, which is their unavoidable situation. If they open up the "right reason" a little and add a few more, they would not only walk the "wrong reason". However, unexpectedly, this only makes things worse: it's like a tiger originally not knowing the taste of human flesh, and a "kind-hearted person" happens to see it hungry and sprinkles some blood for it to eat. Once it tastes it, it simply wants to eat people; it's also like Mr. Dong Guo, who rescued the Zhongshan wolf, and it simply wanted to eat him.</p>
<p>I believe that these unreasonable people definitely have something wrong with their brains; otherwise, why would they disregard human feelings and natural justice like that? The method to deal with them, apart from treating them like patients, and giving them medicine and injections, and giving them considerable persuasion, also requires a head-on blow, to make them suddenly wake up, otherwise, the only option is to lock them up and let them live and die on their own. Because unreasonableness is "barbaric", and to deal with truly "barbaric" people, this is the only way. Unreasonableness is the lack of a sense of right and wrong; "the lack of a sense of right and wrong is not human", and to deal with "non-humans", this is also the only way.</p>
<p>"When a person is about to die, their words are kind." Kindness may be interpreted as "reasonable". Cao Cao, a cunning hero of his time, did many unreasonable things throughout his life. When he was about to die, he had a will to "distribute incense and sell shoes", which was "kind", which was reasonable. I think that the generally unreasonable people of today will probably only realize it when they die!</p>
<p>Then, the "gentlemen" or "kind-hearted people" of today, if they really want to carry the Buddha to the Western Paradise and do it thoroughly, should also find ways to urge these unreasonable people to reach the point of "their words are kind" as soon as possible!</p>

<h3 id="e118">Self-Treatment for Sexual Neurasthenia That Affects Human Happiness <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian University of Labor</p>
<p>The state of sexual neurasthenia is no different from that of general ordinary neurasthenia. The first stage is hypersensitivity of the reproductive organs, early marriage, spermatorrhea, neurosis, and spermatorrhea phenomena. Progressing to the second stage, it is difficult to have sexual intercourse, or lack of semen, decreased libido, and decreased pleasure symptoms that follow.</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is the hypersensitivity of the sexual organs, which can cause ejaculation with slight stimulation. Early marriage is also due to the same reason. Most of the results can lead to kidney deficiency, especially early marriage. The more persistent sexual neurasthenia is, the more indescribable its state of weakness becomes.</p>
<p>The cause of sexual neurasthenia is mostly due to masturbation. According to patients, the symptoms are roughly the same as those of ordinary neurasthenia, such as heaviness in the head, fatigue in the morning, dizziness, insomnia, spermatorrhea, central palpitation, and loss of appetite. During sexual intercourse, there is premature ejaculation and impotence. Severe symptoms can lead to the danger of infertility.</p>
<p>Speaking of the general treatment methods for the above symptoms, they all involve nourishing tonics, hygienic exercise, avoiding overwork of the mind and body, ensuring bowel movements, avoiding the use of irritating foods, and using hormone agents. But no matter how various hygienic exercises are used, the German testicular essence preparation for men, "Butikang", is indispensable. It is an indispensable medicine. This medicine was invented by the German physiologist Dr. Mellen with 30 years of experience. In addition to using the testosterone of strong animals, its composition also incorporates precious mineral and plant tonics that meet biological standards, such as phosphorus and calcium.</p>
<p>Since "Butikang" for men is a metabolic agent, even if it is not a patient with sexual neurasthenia, if an elderly person uses it, they can also expect to live to a ripe old age.</p>
<p>Although sexual work is a human responsibility, excessive indulgence is harmful and useless. Excessive sexual desire can weaken a man's energy, and at the same time, it also exhausts women. Therefore, for those who indulge in lust, the activity function of the sexual nerves must also be low. In order to prevent premature aging, it is very effective to supplement it with "Butikang". The female version can regulate menstruation and plant seeds, and relieve anorgasmia. It heals anemia and breast lumps with one dose. This is truly a gynecological holy medicine.</p>

<h3 id="e119">New Theory of Gonorrhea Treatment <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>The meaning of the two words "treating gonorrhea" is indeed a matter worthy of study in the treatment of gonorrhea. There are two reasons for this: one is the superficial treatment of gonorrhea, and the other is the complete treatment of gonorrhea. Local treatment of gonorrhea is only temporarily effective, and often has many reactions. However, because patients see that it is slightly effective, they are often completely unaware of the danger. By the time the gonorrhea poison spreads internally, the patient's physical strength is reduced due to various adverse reactions. Therefore, we often see many patients taking inferior medicines, and just as the patient is getting a slight effect, complications arise amidst the joy. As a result, they are shocked and regret it, and seek other solutions.</p>
<p>The true treatment of gonorrhea must be based on the truth of gonorrhea, and must not use a piecemeal method to solve gonorrhea. Then any gonorrhea can be removed in one fell swoop, to avoid persistent recurrences. Dr. Peter of Germany, based on the non-specific therapy of gonorrhea poison, uses a protein-pigment mixture to make "Kelinong". The so-called non-specific therapy occupies the most superior position in the treatment of gonorrhea. Because after taking it, it can enhance the patient's own cell anti-gonorrhea function, so this treatment of gonorrhea is both extremely proper and thorough. In general, acute urethritis anterior, urethritis posterior, orchitis, cystitis, prostatitis, etc., and the transformation of these symptoms into chronic, secondary or complicated symptoms, taking "Kelinong" can absolutely cure it fundamentally in the short term. On the one hand, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used externally, and "Kaxuedi Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally for female gonorrhea leukorrhea, so the effect is even more rapid!</p>

<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Patient Lin Haiqing, 23 years old, from Wuxi, resides on Xinzha Road in this city (self-reported) Had a slight cough a year ago, which was very rare and mild, so he did not pay attention to it, but his body became thinner and weaker, and he easily became tired. Although he had taken cod liver oil on the market, it did not have much effect. Last autumn, due to mental stimulation, the symptoms deteriorated day by day. Every afternoon, his cheeks were flushed, and he often had night sweats at night, and his appetite decreased greatly. There was a lot of thick sputum, and he often coughed up a little blood, so he came for treatment. (Treatment process) I first measured his body temperature, which was normal in the morning, and often between 39 and 40 degrees in the afternoon. After checking with X-rays, I found two cavities in the lungs, and diagnosed it as third-stage lung disease. I ordered him to rest quietly, take in nutritious foods, and take a large amount of "Bufei Nar", and he recovered after five days of treatment.</p>

<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Medical Doctor of Germany</p>
<p>The prostate gland is in front of the bladder, and there are many nerves around it. Those who masturbate excessively or have excessive sexual intercourse will cause local neurasthenia and loss of control, so it is easy to leak. According to expert research, the so-called spermatorrhea is a symptom of chronic prostatitis. Such as gonorrhea, bladder diseases, excessive sexual intercourse, masturbation, etc., can make the prostate gland likely to develop chronic inflammation. Patients with this disease not only often have seminal fluid flowing out of the urethral opening, but also have various neurological symptoms. Such as decreased libido, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, kidney atrophy, back pain, headache, backache, dizziness, palpitations, fatigue, and terror ideas. The patient's temperament is also becoming more and more gloomy and worried, and they often have a pessimistic view of their personal destiny, feeling that their illness is too severe, and their mental activity is reduced as a result, and pessimism often occurs as a result.</p>
<p>The first treatment for this disease is to clear the mind and reduce desires, so as to avoid stimulation of the local nerves. As for drug treatment, only "Nais Yijing Tablets" have a definite effect. This agent functions to consolidate the essence gate, reduce the hypersensitivity of the erection nerves, and can stop any severe spermatorrhea and spermatorrhea immediately after taking it, and has the effect of calming the brain nerves, so that those with habitual insomnia have a full opportunity to be treated. Therefore, its effect is a hundred times better than essence-solidifying tablets. Those who have taken various essence-solidifying tablets on the market without effect may wish to try this product.</p>

<h3 id="e122">A Comparative View of Internal and External Gonorrhea Treatment <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>A disease has one treatment, and a disease also has two treatments, but the purpose of the treatment is nothing more than to fundamentally solve the disease being treated. This is true for other diseases, and especially true for gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is a disease with many unpredictable changes, and a scientific method must be used to find out the truth about gonorrhea. Therefore, the treatment for gonorrhea can also be symptomatic. Internal medicine therapy should be used when internal medicine therapy is needed, and external treatment should be used when external treatment is needed, or a combination of internal and external treatment should be used. In short, take a picture and you're done.</p>
<p>Speaking only of internal and external treatment methods, the internal medicine method aims to select drugs. These drugs must be tested and introduced by world-renowned physicians to be reliable. In this regard, the one that is generally praised and used is the gonorrhea holy agent "Kelinong". The principle of invention of "Kelinong" is based on non-specific therapy, and is made by mixing protein and yellow pigment. The function is to generate anti-gonorrhea phagocytic action after taking it. Therefore, this action can reach deep tissues, so gonorrhea in the deep parts of each part does not need to be treated with external surgery (in fact, external surgery is also useless) and can be completely and fundamentally cured. As for external therapy, German static electricity can be called the best among them. Because static electricity therapy is good at sweeping away all the gonorrhea remaining in the urethra. Therefore, the combined use of the two can achieve the best of both worlds. However, if you only take "Kelinong", use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and for female gonorrhea leukorrhea, use "Kaxuedi Vaginal Tablets" externally as a suppository, you can also thoroughly remove gonorrhea from the urethra or the vagina. I specialize in the study of gonorrhea, and I cannot say that my experience with gonorrhea is not much. Therefore, I dare to describe its general meaning here. Consultation hours: 10 am to 6 pm. Send 20 numbers for consultation every day, and only take 5 yuan for each number.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Street Salesman <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Business is slow, causing the machines to stop. I constantly worry that the boss will tell me to get lost!</p>
<p>First of all, I absolutely believe that nine out of ten people regard the business of "street sales" as one of the lowest and most humble professions. Isn't that so? In the minds of the general public, the "street salesman" is just like a begging "beggar". He has to endure scolding from other people's families, but he cannot help but show a very polite and humble attitude. He has to endure the contempt of other people's families, and he has to swallow those embarrassing words... In short, although we use the term "Mr." to address "street salesmen", their lives are really hard and pitiful.</p>
<p>Don't look at them sitting in carriages with white silk wheels and black-painted bodies, and immediately speculate that their lives are probably very wealthy and comfortable. Does the "street salesman" really feel happy and cheerful? On the surface, he is sometimes mistaken for a big errand in a big foreign company or a big company; sometimes, people see them carrying a black leather bag full of things, and may even think of them as a professor in a university; but in fact, is the "street salesman" really so extravagant? No, absolutely not. This carriage is not his own. The entire property of a "street salesman" is just a dirty black robe and a pair of cloth shoes with holes. When the car stops, he will be scolded and looked down upon. Where can he talk about any prestige or extravagance?</p>
<p>"The business in the shop has been really slow lately! Wasn't it still busy with two machines running on this day last year? But now, it seems that one machine is still running lazily. If this continues, what other solution is there other than closing down?"</p>
<p>These words from the boss really made my heart jump uneasily. Although I can argue with the boss that these days are really different from previous years. It is difficult to do all kinds of business, and the printing industry is no exception, right? The number of competitors has increased, and business is certainly being taken away a lot... But isn't the job of a "street salesman" to drum up business? If business is slow, causing the machines to stop, the boss probably always thinks that the "street salesman" is useless.</p>
<p>In fact, the worries of every "street salesman" are much greater than the worries of the boss. The "street salesman" knows very well that if he does not work hard to drum up business, his job is sure to be broken!</p>
<p>So, when there is nothing that can be done, you still have to find a way! It is indeed too difficult to find "new customers", then, let's go to those "old customers" and see if there is any business to be done.</p>
<p>The carriage dragged me to the door of every "old customer":</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr., are you busy! It's been a long time since we've met, how have you been lately?" I used a very gentle voice, very respectfully, and very humbly to greet an "old customer".</p>
<p>"Hmm!" A lifeless reply.</p>
<p>"The business in the shop has been really slow lately. Can Mr. help me with some business here?" I continued to say in a polite tone. I hope that this "old customer" can then come up with many things that he wants to print.</p>
<p>"Business? It's all been snatched away by other people. I was originally planning to give it to you to print; but other people's prices are really too cheap, and the delivery is also quick. When the boss sees this situation, of course he always thinks of asking cheaper people to print!"</p>
<p>These few sentences were like a basin of cold water poured on my face, making my heart feel extremely depressed and trembling. Doesn't the boss in the shop often scold me for setting the prices too honestly and too cheaply? He said: "This kind of price will not only not get the so-called 'benefits', but it is also very likely to lose money. You really must not 'reduce the price' so recklessly next time. You have to be careful!" Customers scold me for the price being too high, and the boss scolds me for the price being too low. Really, they are all attacking the "street salesman".</p>
<p>Also, when someone who prints things has just given you the sample to print, they are urging you to deliver the goods quickly. The price goes without saying that it must be the cheapest, even if it is cheap enough to make the boss lose money. At the same time, the delivery must be "fast": then you have to add "night work"! But opening night work requires double pay, and the boss is naturally very well-behaved. He will never do that, then, no matter how quickly you hurry, the delivery date will always be a few days later than the originally agreed date. As a result, it is again the "street salesman" who is unlucky and gets scolded.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I really can't bear it, and I want to quit this "begging" job, I would rather not do it. But I don't have this courage. This job also took a lot of effort to find. Although the money is little, isn't my wife and children at home living on these earnings? I can't not do this business, I can't bear other people's scolding and contempt....</p>
<p>Business is slow, causing the machines to stop... I constantly worry that the boss will tell me to get lost!</p>

<p>While it is a established truth that peace must be maintained by force, seeking peace through force is truly unheard of in the world. As the saying goes, "No fight, no acquaintance." Is the attainment of peace truly to be learned from the barrel of a gun? I will watch with bated breath for this peace.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: A Mother with a Chignon and Blue Skirt is Wise and Kind; An Old Man with Silver Beard and Emerald Sleeves is a Paragon</p>
<p>Village Chief Zhu said, "That's true! Although he's the village chief of Water Bamboo Village, his wife actually manages many of the village affairs. Originally, although he's from Water Bamboo Village, he didn't live in the countryside. It was after marrying Xie Ayu that he came to live in the countryside. His wife said: Anyway, you have no money left and you're getting old. It's better to live in seclusion in the countryside and not worry about anything. You and I can at least contribute a small part to the country, and the rest of your life can be considered as extra. Living in the countryside, Xie Ayu takes care of this old man very well, like a nanny raising an infant. Unexpectedly, nurturing and nurturing, she actually nurtured an infant." Village Chief Zhu's words made everyone laugh. Zhu Aiqun said, "That old Village Chief Xu is really like a child at home. Even eating and dressing are taken care of by his wife. For example, when eating, his wife only allows him to eat two bowls, and he doesn't dare to eat a third. For example, when dressing, he doesn't pay much attention when the weather suddenly turns cold or warm, but his wife is always mindful. Sometimes he doesn't want to wear it, and she has to coax him like a child to get him to wear it. Also, when old Village Chief Xu comes out, his wife often accompanies him." Village Chief Zhu said, "That's also true! I remember on the third day of the third month this year, when our Freedom Village held the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the new village, we invited 33 village chiefs from neighboring villages, and old Xu also came. His wife also accompanied him. People who didn't know would have thought it was a granddaughter accompanying her grandfather. Who would know they were husband and wife? I saw that she paid close attention to the old man's diet and daily life, just like Aiqun said, like taking care of a child. At our meeting, we invited village chiefs from various villages because there were many things that needed to be jointly organized by various villages, not just things unique to one village. Just like the various countries of the world have international affairs, our various villages also have inter-village affairs. Such as water conservancy, farmland, sanitation, education, etc., there are plenty of things that can be jointly organized by contacting various villages. Therefore, we often hold this village chief joint meeting. Whenever Village Chief Xu comes to this meeting, his wife always accompanies him. Sometimes he simply doesn't come, and his wife represents him, which shows that his wife knows more than he does." He Shuangyu said, "Huh! She's here to represent the village chief, so can a woman be a village chief?" Village Chief Zhu said, "Why not? Among the 33 village chiefs this time, five are women. What can't women do now? Just like the affairs of old man Xu, aren't they all managed by his wife!" (117)</p>
<h3 id="e126">More on the Demolition Wave in Qingyu Lane <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Qing</p>
<p>Regarding the demolition dispute in Qingyu Lane, from the Women's Bank's warning against demolition, Mr. Yu Qiaqing's unsuccessful mediation, to the unfortunate events of forced demolition, beatings, and cutting off water and electricity, it seems that there is no hope for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>In fact, the Women's Bank is well aware that after the demolition of houses in Qingyu Lane, more than 3,000 tenants in this pigeonhole-like Shanghai have nowhere to live. The reason why the Women's Bank insists on demolition is because of the contractual relationship with the Poor Children's Education Institute. Therefore, the biggest key lies here. As the Qingyu Lane tenants' advertisement requesting support from all sectors says, in this "turbulent world and repeated disasters," is the Poor Children's Education Institute determined to fulfill the contract signed with the Women's Bank? Judging from the advertisements of both sides, the Poor Children's Education Institute seems to have never stood up and said a definite word.</p>
<p>Naturally, legally speaking, the signed contract must be fulfilled. The more than 3,000 tenants in Qingyu Lane should have left long ago, or gone to the refugee camps. It is superfluous to complain in the newspapers. But since we are all Chinese, the miserable situation of "living in turbulent times and suffering repeated disasters" should be witnessed even if not personally experienced. The Poor Children's Education Institute is a charitable organization, so it should make every effort to provide immediate relief to refugees. Moreover, the tenants in Qingyu Lane are not living there for free.</p>
<p>Therefore, the greatest power to resolve this issue lies in the hands of the Poor Children's Education Institute, and seeking an answer from this focus is also the quickest shortcut. Naturally, what I mean is: let's temporarily abandon the law and talk about humanity.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Poor Children's Unemployed Relief Center <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Establish Ten Free Primary Schools; Publicly Recruit Principals and Teachers</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, countless poor children have lost their schooling. Recently, enthusiastic people in society have organized a Shanghai Poor Children's Unemployed Relief Center, which has decided to establish more than a dozen free primary schools starting next semester. At the same time, from the 20th of this month, it will publicly recruit principals and teachers. The registration office is located on the fifth floor of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association on Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>It is said that since Ma Xiangbo, Zhang Shouyong, Wu Yunzhai, Dai Chunfeng, and others have successively donated scholarships to the Poor Children's Unemployed Relief Center, the advancement of various tasks has become smoother. Recently, it has been decided to expand the scope of relief. Starting next semester, Shanghai will be divided into ten districts, with ten free schools established in each district, each school with a quota of 200 students, and all expenses will be waived. The first district will be named Model Primary School, the second district National Construction Primary School, the third district Rejuvenation Primary School, the fourth district Cooperation Primary School, the fifth district Datong Primary School, the sixth district Thrift Primary School, the seventh district Loyalty Primary School, the eighth district Love and Assistance Primary School, the ninth district Faith and Righteousness Primary School, and the tenth district Peace Primary School.</p>
<p>For the sake of pooling wisdom and concentrating talent, the Relief Center has separately hired enthusiastic educators to serve as preparatory committee members and publicly recruited enthusiastic free educators to serve as principals or teachers. Since this news came out, many people have gone to obtain regulations or register. On the afternoon of the first day of registration, the author also went to the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, took the elevator straight to the fifth floor, and found No. 519, with a sign at the door that read "Office of the Shanghai Poor Children's Unemployed Relief Center." Walking inside, the place was quite small. Several young men and women were already inside asking for regulations and filling out forms, and some were asking an officer about the establishment of free primary schools. I also asked the officer for a copy of the regulations.</p>
<p>It is said that anyone who has always been interested in free education and has served in the education field, regardless of gender, can fill out a form to apply. In addition to filling out the application form and stating their resume, they must also prepare a weekly course schedule according to their specialties, from the first grade to the sixth grade of elementary school. After passing the application, they will be hired by the center as principals or teachers and start preparing for the opening of school. In the future, the location of the school will also be the responsibility of the principals and teachers who have passed the application to find. The daily class time is stipulated from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, a total of three hours, so that it will not conflict with the original class time. Although it is said to be volunteering, each teacher also has a monthly subsidy of 10 to 25 yuan, which will be determined by the Relief Center after the school opens. However, after passing the application, they must also find a qualified guarantor to guarantee faithful service.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many poor children in Shanghai today who are displaced, out of school, and have lost their parents. The children of today are the masters of the country in the future. Whether we stand on human compassion or on the perspective of the country or society, we should do our best to help these large numbers of out-of-school poor children. Now that the Poor Children's Unemployed Relief Center is actively carrying out relief work, it is certainly good news for out-of-school children, but in order to achieve good results, it still needs the support of people in society. Those with money should donate money, and those with strength should do some volunteer work, so that this work can proceed smoothly and achieve unexpected results in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Casual Talk About the Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Weiwei</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Liu Hanchen, after returning to Shanghai from Tianjin and starring alone in "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" at the Tianchan Stage, actually sold out for more than a dozen consecutive performances. It can be said that Liu Hanchen gave Tianchan a life-saving shot. In my opinion, there are several reasons why "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" can sell:</p>
<p>(1) "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" is a play focused on martial arts scenes. Tianchan Stage has Liu Hanchen, Wang Guiqing, Gao Xueqiao, Wang Fuying, and Dong Zhiyang, all of whom have different styles but are all popular martial arts performers. Shanghai people love to watch exciting entertainment, so this play sells because these martial arts performers really have considerable appeal.</p>
<p>(2) Liu Hanchen "goes all out" in every performance, using all his strength and giving his all. This is something that no one else can match, and it suits the taste of some people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) In the eyes of laymen, it is absolutely difficult to distinguish the skills of Liu Hanchen, Wang Guiqing, Gao Xueqiao, and Wang Fuying. Because everyone wants to please the audience, they are all overcome by a desire to win and are unwilling to relax on stage. The actors and the audience (especially those in the same profession) compete with each other on stage, each showing their talents, and naturally, there are wonderful moments, which can satisfy the audience in the audience.</p>
<p>(4) The script of "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" is quite tightly arranged, and the scenery and props are also excellent, all above the "Red Robe" and "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea" previously performed by Tianchan.</p>
<p>Because of the above reasons, "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" can make a lot of money. It is not surprising that a theater performs a large play and sells out for several consecutive performances. However, it is worth studying that Liu Hanchen, who has not been appreciated by the public in the past, has achieved such amazing results by being the leading performer at Tianchan Stage.</p>
<h3 id="e129">"Tears of a Dancing Girl" and Others <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Victor</p>
<p>— Reflections After Watching the Sunday Theater</p>
<p>This Sunday, the Sunday Experimental Theater of the Shanghai Drama Society performed three one-act plays by the Shanghai Jiaoyi Society: one was "Little Scene on a Snowy Night" by Zhang Min, one was the collective creation "Tears of a Dancing Girl" by the Shanghai Drama Society; and the third was "Mother" adapted by Tian Han.</p>
<p>The backstage lighting, scenery, props, makeup, etc., were still the responsibility of the Shanghai Drama Society.</p>
<p>Actors from the Shanghai Drama Society, such as Xia Xia, Lan Lan, Zhang Wanjun, Shu Yin, Tu Guangqi, Ding Zhi, Xu Li, Zhou Qi, etc., were also present. Now let's talk about the performance of the three plays:</p>
<p>(1) "Little Scene on a Snowy Night" - This is a one-act play, and there is only one actor. It is just like "Before Breakfast." When an actor has to support a stage, it is relatively difficult. If the story and dialogue written by the playwright are too plain and simple, or if the director cannot grasp the atmosphere of the play (lighting, music, the actor's position, the pitch of the voice, the speed of the action), then this building supported by one person will definitely make the audience feel lonely and empty.</p>
<p>"Little Scene on a Snowy Night" has a new type of writing, almost using the brushstrokes of a comic strip, lightly sketching a snowy night, a poor mother, without money, without legs, painfully sending her child to the nursery. The emotions are quite tragic, but this is only a small poem and does not become a good story.</p>
<p>Therefore, it gives the audience the impression of coldness and emptiness.</p>
<p>The director also cannot let go of the position of this only actor, always letting her stand in a corner, which is also not good. The actress Ye Qi is capable of acting.</p>
<p>(2) "Tears of a Dancing Girl" - The script is different from the one performed by the dancing girls themselves last time. In particular, the writing has been strengthened after Manli's abortion. Her dance customer, Xiao Chen, still comes to quarrel with her and says that he will not marry her. Manli's crying, laughing, burning photos, and tearing up fake passbooks have added a lot of power to the whole play.</p>
<p>Among the three plays, "Tears of a Dancing Girl" should be considered the best.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Yin Lan, who played Manli, was the most successful; the director also handled the manic laughter of Manli with great power; Yin Lan grasped such personalities as sorrow, desolation, resentment, and anger. In the middle of the burning photos, the music rose up, and the tragic atmosphere was unusually strong. The other actors were all very experienced, such as Xia Wen's Manli and Shen Mo's mother. Yin Qing, who played Linlin, lacked emotion in her speech and even didn't know how to read the lines; her speech was also too low. For example, when she told Manli about her experience of being deceived by a dance customer in Hong Kong, it can be seen that she lacked experience.</p>
<p>(3) "Mother" - The story tells that in the old Russian era, a mother often suffered humiliation and beatings from three generations. Later, her only son finally realized and used new power to save his mother, who had always been bullied by men.</p>
<p>The script is very powerful, but because the several main actors are too weak, the whole play is soft and powerless.</p>
<p>Especially the one who played the father, Mikhail, although he roared violently on the stage, he lacked emotion, such as his laughter, his beating his wife, and his pronunciation suddenly high and low, making the whole play a failure.</p>
<p>Bai Li's mother was very painful and delicate in her performance. Her timidity, terror, and grief were able to grasp the characteristics of a woman living under male violence.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Mao Shilai's Iron Bow Marriage <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Ce Hai</p>
<p>Mao Shilai came to Shanghai for the second time, accompanied by Sha Shixin, Gao Shenglin, etc., and performed at the Golden Stage. Because of the difficulty of getting a good seat, it was not until the third day that Mao performed "Iron Bow Marriage" that I was able to watch it. That night, it was suitable for the sound of cranes and the sound of the wind, and the iron net was densely covered. The Golden Stage opened the show early. When I entered the seat at 8:00, I did not see Yan Shishan's performance and Gao Shenglin's eight big hammer car battles. What I saw was only two episodes of "Iron Bow Marriage" by Sha Shixin, Gao Shenglin, Mao Shilai, Jiang Shiyu, Ai Shiju, and Qiu Shengrong. Shixin's makeup was clean and emaciated, and his work was also calm and restrained, not as gentle as Fuying, but slightly more handsome than Lian Liang. Unfortunately, his voice was weak, even worse than Zhou Xiaotian. Only the first few rows could distinguish his singing and pronunciation, and the rear rows could only see his actions. The lifting of the hair when cutting off his arm was clean and agile, but the arm was not thrown up, which was a slight imperfection. Shenglin's Lu Wenlong was slightly less handsome in his makeup, and his acting and singing were only adequate. Sitting and listening to Wang Zuo's storytelling scene, he frequently straightened his clothes, his attitude seemed cramped, I don't know why.</p>
<p>Mao Shilai's "Iron Bow Marriage" was popular when he came to Shanghai last time. This performance is even more refined. His voice is also clearer than before. After a year of separation, he should be admired. This play is very heavy, focusing on its key points. The first half focuses on the test of the bow and marriage, which must be performed with romantic amorous feelings. In the second half, he changes clothes and abandons the marriage, with the female role playing the male role. Shilai's performance, from beginning to end, is impeccable. I especially like the play of tying the belt in the second half, with the opening, fighting, dialogue, and expression all washing away the affectation of the female role. When the real and fake Zhengfu meet, he simultaneously manipulates two voices, speaking in the female role's vernacular to his mother, and changing to the male role's tone to Wang. The mixing and changing of rigidity, softness, yin, and yang is his special skill. The audience applauded, and I also applauded.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Fencing Team will be organized tomorrow, and the picture above shows Team A members practicing attack methods.</p>
<p>"The Misanthrope" will be performed soon. "The Misanthrope," a satirical comedy by the great French writer Molière, is a famous play that Shanghai drama audiences have long been looking forward to. It is now known that the Shanghai University Literary Society and the Haiyan Drama Club have jointly rehearsed the play, directed by the famous actor Meng He. It is said that it has been decided to perform it at the Grand Auditorium of the French Municipal Council at No. 11 Huanlong Road in the French Concession.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two Notable Things About the Late Righteous Actor Luo Kuifang</p>
<p>The two were arguing when suddenly a certain lady walked into the room, and the maid hurriedly exited. Xiao Bao was very familiar with the lady, and sometimes when a certain gentleman was out, the lady would also come to talk to him a few words, so he did not mind seeing the lady enter. However, today's situation was different from the past. First, it was late at night and the master had not returned. Second, he suddenly ordered the maid to give him money. Third, when he repeatedly wanted to leave, the lady always tried to stop him, saying that a certain gentleman would return soon, and that a phone call had come asking him to wait a little longer. Seeing that it was already three or four in the morning, a certain gentleman had not yet returned to the residence. He repeatedly urged the servant to return to his room and go to bed early, allowing him to wait here alone, but the lady ignored him. Later, she actually lay down and wanted to help him fill his pipe. How could he dare to accept it? After a while, the lady actually stood up and went to bolt the door. Xiao Bao was a smart person, and he understood everything. At this time, his heart was uneasy, and he thought to himself how kind a certain gentleman was to him, and the lady was also a lady of a large family, who usually treated him very well. Today, due to a moment of thought, she suddenly had an evil thought, which is something that women may have. However, I, Luo, must not be as confused as she is. While she is still undecided and has not taken any action, it is better to plan a way to escape this situation quickly. After thinking about it, he deliberately packed two large pipes of tobacco and smoked them one after another. He immediately stood up and said that he was dizzy, and he also made a look of standing unsteadily. The lady ignored everything and used her hand to pull him down to sleep, saying that he would be fine after lying down for a while. At this moment, Xiao Bao suddenly somersaulted and fell to the ground, immediately losing consciousness and frothing at the mouth, as if his old epilepsy had relapsed. The lady knew that he had this disease, and she also saw that his head was broken and bleeding profusely. She was also frightened at the time, and hurriedly pried open the door and called in the servants, who used a car to take him to the hospital for treatment. This suspense ended like a wind. After a few days, Xiao Bao still went on stage to perform, with a plaster on his forehead. This is a memento of this incident. Later, a certain lady understood and respected his character even more. Xiao Bao's quick wit to save himself and others, and his righteous act of knowing gratitude and not coveting other people's wives, are not common in the world of actors, let alone in this evil society. He was able to fight for his personality and was unwilling to be a plaything when he was young, so he later dared not play with women even more. A person's behavior before and after is related. It is a pity that he died too early. If he had died a few years later, he could have earned a lot of money just by recording records and teaching drama. Furthermore, his Tan-style opera was really authentic. Anyone who wanted to indulge in opera but could not hear Shu Yan's singing could often listen to a few of his specialties in Shanghai to satisfy their cravings. Moreover, he was slightly better than Shu Yan in some aspects. ——(18)——</p>

<h3 id="e132">The Age of Female Stars <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Yu</p>
<p>Women like to shorten their age the most, even if the beauty of their appearance has become an irrefutable ironclad proof, they still reluctantly say a few years less before they feel happy. From this point, we can understand the common fear of aging among women. The reason is that women adorn themselves for the pleasure of others, and who doesn't hope to show their beauty and youth under makeup? However, good times don't last long, and it is the fleeting youth that ages most easily under the frequent changes of years. So, when their beautiful youth has passed and their beauty has declined, they know that their golden age has passed, but they still smile reluctantly and try their best to discount their age in front of others, comforting themselves in vain.</p>
<p>Chinese empresses, of course, cannot avoid the faults they say! Most of them want to preserve their youth. Why are men unique? (Editor's note: old age,) Who wants it? Neglecting their own position, not knowing how to strive for status and reputation in art, and only showing off their beauty to the audience, as if they want the audience to regard them as just sixteen-year-old girls every year! In fact? The audience is not blind, although the illusion reflected on the screen after they have undergone makeup and beauty treatments is much younger, but the constantly increasing years will not fail to leave traces on the faces of female stars.

<p>59th Game Five Rats and Five Righteous Men</p>
<p>Proposed by Xue Weihan</p>
<p>Red Moves First to Win</p>
<p>The solution will be revealed tomorrow.</p>
<p>Explanation of Games 36 and 37</p>
<p>There are records in old chess manuals of the Screen Horse formation breaking the Central Cannon, but there is no record of the Central Cannon breaking the Screen Horse. Based on factual research, since the Screen Horse can break the Central Cannon, the Central Cannon can also break the Screen Horse. According to the editor's experience, the Screen Horse is not necessarily able to break the Central Cannon, but only the Screen Horse can best resist the Central Cannon. The Screen Horse has many variations and is extremely difficult to use. The games recorded in the manual are only to show scholars various methods of using the horse. Therefore, the Central Cannon often hides superfluous moves (useless moves), and it is extremely difficult for those with shallow artistic knowledge to identify them. If there are no hidden superfluous moves, then both sides are evenly matched, and neither side has any chance of winning. The manual does not have the Central Cannon breaking the Screen Horse, not because the Central Cannon cannot break the Screen Horse. Looking at the various games in the manual where the Screen Horse breaks the Central Cannon, there are many variations in the Cannon's moves, but the method of advancing the middle soldier and directly attacking the middle road is rarely seen. Advancing the middle soldier to take the middle road is the most taboo for the Screen Horse. The editor's various methods of the Screen Horse competing for the first move against the Central Cannon allow both sides to display their strengths. They are novel and ingenious, all derived from experience and will never be the same as the old manual. This game is the method of the Central Cannon obtaining the first move. From Cannon 2 to 5 to Chariot 2 to 7, as mentioned earlier, Soldier 7 advances one and Soldier 5 advances one, the Cannon obtains the first move. At this time, the Screen Horse is constantly forced, showing the need to compete for the first move, without relaxing a step.</p>
<p>Advancing the Elephant 4 to 5 and the Horse 3 to 4 are both inevitable. Advancing the Soldier 5 to 1 to Chariot 7 to 1 is a method of obtaining the first move by sending the middle soldier with the patrolling river Chariot. It is a new situation and is indeed an experienced move.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Chinese People Plan to Build a Theater in France <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The number of Chinese merchants in Paris is truly numerous and countless. Now, there is a plan to build a theater in the city as a place for performances, entertainment, and relaxation. A Western newspaper stated: "The Chinese actors are exquisitely dressed, their skills are refined, and they are extremely pleasing to the eye, worthy of praise!" It also said: "The Chinese who have established shops in Paris are as numerous as scales on a fish; their buying and selling of goods is increasing day by day, making it a true hub for merchants."</p>
<h3 id="e135">Woman Disguised as a Man <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>On the eighth day, a strange case was heard at the Mixed Court, worthy of attention. It involved a female server disguised as a man, sent by the police station. Magistrate Chen ascended to the court and interrogated her. According to her confession, her name was Zhou Xiaoda, from Suzhou, 24 years old. She worked as a female server at the Fengxiantai opium den in the French Concession outside Xiaodongmen. On that day, Chen Xiaoyu, a Huizhou man from Kaiyuantai Clothing Store on Dong Street in the city, who knew her, wanted her to dress as a man for fun and offered her ten silver dollars. So he brought her boots, hats, robes, and jackets, which she wore. They went together to Zuichuju on the Great Road to smoke opium, where they were apprehended by the police. Magistrate Chen was furious, saying that the female servers had already caused harm, yet she dared to be so flamboyant. He immediately ordered her to be beaten several hundred times and prepared a document to be sent to the county for strict handling, in order to rectify public morals. When she was escorted to the court, the onlookers were like a wall. The female server, Zhou Xiaoda, wore a red felt wind hat, a blue crepe horse-hoof-sleeved leather robe, a sky-blue satin leather vest, and satin boots. Her swaying gait made it difficult to distinguish her gender. Her capture at the time must have been due to her strolling about with ease, leading to her being exposed. Currently, gentry and merchants are urgently requesting a ban on female servers, but this female server is still so unscrupulous, it is unknown what she relies on. Her being sent to the county for strict investigation may slightly alleviate this trend. As for the Chen man who incited her to gamble, if it is true, it can be said to be a cruel joke.</p>
